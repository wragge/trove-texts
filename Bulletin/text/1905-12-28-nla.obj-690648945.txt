SAID TUE NATURE-STUDENT
DO you see what they want to chase the
boys who hunt locusts for ? Our
teacher is always gassing that boys
should take a nintrest in wild ani-
mals and try to find out how they ’re made.
Nature-study or something he calls it. Well
locusts are wild animals, are n’t they ? And
if you go in the Domain to hunt them there’s
men there that come and hunt yo u. Pat
Murphy says the Government pays them.
\\ hy does, it ? It’s like a dog in a manger.
Ihey won t catch the locusts themselves and
they won t let you catch them neither.
Good job they can’t run much. You can
easy dodge ’em unless they come when
you re not looking. I s ’pose they can’t
climb trees neither, and that’s why they
don t catch any locusts. But because boys
can climb trees they chase us. Pat says he
heard one man say we was chased because
we stroyed the trees—broke the old branches
oil I s pose he meant. VV ell that’s not our
fault, is it ? The locusts live in trees, don’t
they,? And we have to climb the trees to
get em, haven’t we ? Me can’t help it if
they don’t live on the ground, can we ? But
if they did. live on the ground and we hunted
em there’d be some other excuse for stop-
ping us, I know. Boys are n’t ever let do
any things at all. Besides we can’t break
the trees if the trees are any good. It’s
only the old rotten boughs that break off',
and what’s the good of a nold rotten bough
to a tree ? If yo u was a tree would you
like to have a nold rotten bough hanging
on to you ? Wouldn’t you rather a boy
came and broke it oft' and made you
look nice ? Besides I s’pose the trees get
tired of having the locusts on them singing
all the time and scratching. But if you tell
a man that he only laughs. Pat Murphy
got a cut on his leg an inch deep where h
fell off a tree. He showed it to me yesterday.
There’s heaps of different kinds of locusts
heaps ! Oh, I don’ know. Greengrocers
and floury bakers, and yellow Mondays, anc
black fiddlers, and double drummers, anc
blackbottles—heaps ! Greengrocers ar
common : they ’re no good. Most of ’em ’
dummies. The black fiddlers are the one
to sing if you get a good ’un. Why do locust
sing better when you shake ’em ? There ’
nobody shaking them in the tree, and
they sing there alright. I got twenty-fou
to-day, and nineteen yesterday, and twenty
the day before. That’s sixty-three in three
days, and a lot of ’em was double drummers
Double drummers have two drums inside
’em; that’s why they ’re called double
drummers. The others have only got one
drum. Yellow Mondays are yellow, o ’
course; and bakers are all over white
dust. I had a baker that would n’t sing, so
I offered him to Lily. She said, “ Take the
nasty thing away. You boys ought to be
ashamed of yourselves for being so cruel.’
What’s cruel ? We don’t hurt ’em, do we
We just catch ’em and shake ’em and make
’em sing. There’s no harm in that, is
there? Perhaps they’re glad to be askec.
to sing. She likes being asked, and she
can’t sing a little bit. If a locust doesn’t
like singing what does it sing for ? It stands
to a reason they like it, and you’d think
they’d sooner sing to people than to trees
would n’t you ?
Now it’s holidays Pat Murphy and I are
going out in the bush every day, catching
If I get a hundred a day that ’ll be a thousanc
in ten days, won’t it ? Pat got a billycan ful
every day last week. He put ’em on a tree
in their yard. Ooh, it’s thick with ’em
You should see it! All crawling up anc
down and singing. He’s got the best col-
lection of any boy’s in our school—all the
kinds, and lots of blackbottles. They ’re the
best, ’cause they ’re the biggest and hardest
to get. They live right away in the tops of
the trees, and you have to climb right up to
get them. They can't fly very high. I think
they always stick on the tree. Yellow Mon-
days fly the highest. They go right out of
sight. But if you get a real big blackbottle
he’s a bute. He eats the little greengrocers.
He does ; I’ve seen him. Pat’s got one he
keeps in a nold bird-cage. It’s as Big !
oh, as big as four nearly, and if you give it
a greengrocer it’ll eat all the inside out.
I think that’s what they live on. Good job
too. There’s too many greengrocers; nobody
wants ’em. This holidays IJm going to get
all the blackbottles arid fiddlers and drum-
mers I can and put ’em on our tree. When
I’ve got two thousand you can come and
hear ’em sing if you like. I ’ll tell you when
it’s a good time. And then you can help
me with my letter. 'We’ve all got to write
a letter to the teacher when school begins
saying how we spent our holidays. I bet
half the boys in our school will say they went
catching locusts. This fellow was a good
’un. You should have heard him sing ; he
was alright. I put him under my pillow last
night to sing me to sleep and he got squashed.
I think I ’ll bury him ; he was too good to
let the cat get him. Cats eat ’em, you know.
It’s a good job there ’s such a lot of
, locusts, is n’t it ?
SPORTIVE SCHOLARSHIP
80ME of the things that diverts scholar's
mind are collected, agreeably in Byways
in the Glassies, by Hugh Platt (Oxford,
Blackwell; 3s. 6d. net). The little
book begins with a set of proverbial and col-
loquial phrases for which parallels are found
in English, Latin, and Greek. One sees the
ball of wit tossed from hand to hand aero
the centuries. The identity of humanity,
whatever the varying pattern of its stu: ’,
appears anew in Mr. Platt’s instance
\\ here we say, for example, “ He is n’t worl 1
liis salt,” Petronius (57) said “IS on vale ;
lotium suum. ’ The same author (62) ha
Mihi anima in naso esse, ” a good renderin
of “My heart was in my mouth.” M
Platt proceeds to find ancient mottoes fo
modern uses, including this for golf : “Mi
cueruntque herbas et non innoxia verba
(from Georgies, ii, 129). Amon
his felicitous quotations recurs the old
anciently-invented application of a line froi
the -Laeid by a boy at Westminster schoo
-—asked by Queen Elizabeth (as the legenc
declares) if he had ever been Hogged :
Infandum, regina, jubes renovare dolorem !
When the Eton masters first started a boa;
on the river one of the boys quoted another
Virgilian line :
Gens inimica mihi Tyrrhenum navigat aequor.
And it is pleasant to be reminded of Bos
well’s story of Young, the author of Nigh
Thoughts . “Here (said he) I had put i,
handsome sundial with this inscription, JEhei
fugaces ! which (speaking with a smile) wa
sadly verified, for by the next morning my
dial had been carried off.”
Many readers will find Mr. Platt’s inci
dental criticism the most attractive portio l
of his bright little book. Here, for example
a comparison of the Homan poets as lovers
It is impossible to read the fourth book of th
De Rerum JYatura, and to resist the impressiot
that Lucretius had at one time of his life sofferec
much unhappiness through love squandered on
frivolous and heartless woman. Further, the ton
of half-suppressed bitterness reveals his secret fea r
that even now he was not secure, but might atanv
moment fall again a victim to the wiles of som
courtezan or coquette.
Horace, on the other hand, never allowed lov
to disturb his easy-going selfishness. In his mos;
exalted mood, love, to use modern images, is
graceful diversion in a world of powder anc
patches and minuets. His Donee gratus errt/m tibi
daintiest of poems, always suggests to me the
courting of a shepherd and a shepherdess in Dres
den china....
To Virgil, I own with regret, the love of women
made no appeal. His emotions were stirred by
an Alexis or an Euryalus. He dreaded alike the
ardours and the jealousies of the female sex; anc
the passage touching that sex where he shows rea
feeJmg and tenderness is concerned, not with the
passion of a man for a woman, but with the boy’
fondness for a little girl. Of course I mean the
passage so admired by Voltaire and Macaulay
Saepibus in nostris,, etc. ( Ec. 1, viii, 37).
For Lucan Merivale claims, I think justly,
genuine sentiment of conjugal affection. This i
as it should be, as he is the only Roman poet wh<
had a really charming wife. Ovid, it is true
speaks with affection of the third lady to
whom he was married ; and in fact she cried very
prettily when he was exiled, and then apparentlv
never troubled her head about him again.
To Ovid love meant gallantry. It was an
amusing chace for an idle man. Ars Amatoria
is the wittiest of mock didactic poems, as the
Rape of the Lock is of mode heroics. . . .
iibullus is the poet of gentle domestic affection
His elegies produce on me an impression of sim
piicity and tenderness and grace, like that which
I feel when reading Sweet Auburn. But Tibullus
has none of Goldsmith’s humour. The sweetest
passage in his poems is that in which he pictures
himself returning unexpectedly to Delia after an
unusual absence (i, 3 fin.):
Tunc mihi, quralis eris, long-os turbata capillos,
Obvia nurlato, Delia, curre pede.
Catullus is simply the healthy young man who
has not been trained, like an Englishman, to sup-
press liis emotions. His ideal of bliss is to have
Lesbia in his arms.
Propertius’s ideal is quite different. If Cynthia
would only scratch, turn him out of the house, and
slam the door upon him ! When she does this, he
stands outside and cries ; and then he thoroughly
enjoys himself. Love yields its delights to him
not m Cynthia’s caresses, but in the analysis of
his own sensations.
jt
A curious little essay deals with the Jus
Osculi :
The jus osculi was the right enjoyed by a
Roman matron (unless famosa, Cic. Rep. iv, 20) of
receiving one kiss per diem from each of her own
and qf her husband s kinsmen as far as the sixth
ciegree, that is second cousins... If the gentle-
man did not exercise his privilege on first meeting
the lady, he lost it for the day. Antiquaries
traced tins custom to the occasion when the
irojan women, after burning the fleet, soothed
their husbands anger by kisses and caresses;
though Cat© alleged that the real object of this
affectionate practice was to discover whether the
lady had been drinking; and this explanation was
generally received. It was also suggested that
jus oscuU arose because ladies liked to show the
number of their relatives, ranch as brides now
like to display a multitude of wedding presents.
Lastly, it was said .that this kiss was originally a
salutation between kinspeople prohibited from
inter •‘marriage...
The jus osculi did not extend to unmarried
girls* & Roman liouscliolci jocvsotvtic
was guarded as strictly as a French girl generally
is now. J
It is interesting to hear that
When Roman women took to authorship, they
distinguished themselves by their frank unreti-
cence [prwire opusculum Sulpiciae, says Ausoniutj,
excusing his own cento), as Sappho had done, and
as certain lady writers of our own days.
*
Quotation caii only suggest the good things,
pithily said, which Mr. Platt offers gene-
rously. Everyone with a love of books and
a taste for style will enjoy his work. We
have excerpted shamelessly, yet add this for
a parting gift:
The mother of Crispinus had been executed for
attempting to poison him. Statius, in a poem
addressed to Crispinus, reminds him of this fact,
and compliments him on the proper feeling he
showed in the matter. What Crispinus thought
of the poet’s verses is not recorded ; but the
reader may recall the omnibus driver who, when-
ever he passed a certain opposition omnibus, held
up a piece of string tied to a loop, the sight of
which never failed to produce a storm of oaths
from the rival driver. “Why does it make him
so angry ? ” asked a passenger. “ Why, he ’s got
no sense of humour, he ain’t,” replied the driver,
laughing till the tears came in his eyes. “His
fattier was ’anged.”
RRCENT BOOKS
Drawing s of Sir E. J. Poynter make r a volume
in the interesting and valuable series of drawings
by British artists, published by Geo. Nevvnes
(Lond., 7s. 6 d. net). The introductory notice is
written by Malcolm Bell, who remarks of Poynter’s
most characteristic paining that ‘"the splendid
Queen of Sheba’s Visit to Solomon, to England’s
irreparable loss, has gone to far-away Sidney, to
set a noble example of imaginative and technical
achievement before the artists of Australia.” It
may be urged that a less expensive example of
Poynter’s achievement would have been noble
enough for us ; and if England will repay the
3000 Z. or so which the picture cost, it is probable
that a vote of the public and of local painters
will consent to England’s loss being repaired.
Bell suggests, what is obvious enough, that
Poynter’s pictures display “evidences of a
marked bias towards both sculpture and archi-
tecture.” That is not precisely their demerit,
but is an indication that they fall short of the
highest merit. Poynter himself, while insisting
that “ the first essential to a good artist is that he
should be a good workman,'’ declared also that
“ the aim of all art (except that which professes
to be portraiture) should be to create a world in
which our imagination should be excited to the
contemplation of noble and beautiful ideas.” It
is in the power of creating noble and beautiful ideas
that Poynter is deficient. His sense of form and his
decorative sense,’ both adtnirahle, are not enforced
by a colour-sense equally good; and almost always
he fails to stimulate the imagination. Study of
this book of drawings leaves an idea that Form
is the staff on which he leans, and that the
vigorous figures which he depicts so well are em-
ployed partly to reinforce his personal weakness.
The sketch for Atalanta, in Atalanta’s Race, yields
a wonderful impression of half-arrested motion,
yet the face has little to give beyond draughts-
manship (which, in one way, is quite enough). In
the head of the Queen of Sheba, Poynter has tried
to convey wistful adoration, yet it remains a weak
head. The careful features and the outstretched
neck make merely a pose and pretence of feeling,
Just one face in this book, that of the figure in
the study for Architecture, has intensity. It is
in tho landscape sketches that one finds Poynter’s
sentiment, Yet he lias a great deal to teach the
local student —his thoroughness, his industry, his
fidelity, shown in drawings often laboured into a
precise perfection.
J*
The War in the Far East, 1904-5, by the Mili-
tary Correspondent of The Times, with maps and
plans by Percy Fisher, is published by John
Murray (Lond., 21a. net). The writer has aimed
rather at authoritative statement and criticism
than at brilliant writing, and his book is full of
ideas that should be assimilated by local military
students. The maps of battle-fields are especially
valuable, and are the first here seen which enable
one to follow fully and intelligently the course of
the war. The battle of Liaoyang, for example,
has no less than ten maps devoted to its varying
phases; and others are treated in similar
detail. It was a mistake not to re-write the
book up-to-date. To print the letters partly
in their original form, with a commentary often
level with the date when they were pub-
lished, is to waste space and time. The method
adopted has the advantage of reflecting the
impressions of an hour; but sjuch impressions
matter little now, when it is possible to take a
complete view of the campaign, and to see in pro-
per sequence and relation events which, at the
time of their occurrence, were obscure. Fre-
quently one finds paragraphs penned in an
endeavour to forecast the course of the war-
paragraphs doubtless justified when written,
but irrelevant now that the course of
the war has settled itself historically. The
author's final comment, his praise of ordo and
bushido, should be taken to heart by Australians.
Of Japan: “ There has never been a nation engaged
in war since legendary days which has given such
signal proofs of utter immolation of self for the
sake of Emperor, country, and home... Victory
has been both won and’ deserved by national
qualities which made any other result but victory
impossible.”—Like all Murray’s books, this is
admirably produced.
City Sketches, by W. Moore, is a booklet
illustrated by A. Sass, Benison, Shuni, and H. Waugh
and published by Fitchett JBros-., Melbourne. The coni
tents are sketches of life, in Melbourne, some of t-hetn
very well done (particularly an account of the unique
Melbourne restaurant—“ Fasoli’s ”). The liberal illus-
trations are interesting and badly engraved’: Benison’s
“ Old Gal ” deserves a special word of commendation.
At its modest price of 6d. the booklet is uncommonly
well worth buying.
A while ago, dit-on, came somebody with a
blight suggestion to David Syme : “Why not
illustrate The Age ? ” The veteran smiled his
grim smile, and answered to the effect that a
considerable portion of his life had been spent in
reconciling the quarrels of. literary men, and it
was too late for him now to begin to soothe the
jealousies of designers. But if Syme’s argument
for immortality should hold g®od after all, it may
be possible for him to arrange the publication of
an illustrated Age in a sphere beyond. Won’t he
be lonely without it? Would n’t Heaven be more
comfortable with it? Ah, these are profitless
speculations :
“Where, where is John Knox?” one demands
sadly ; and Echo answers warmly, “ Nox ! ”
Jimmy Welch, the popular London actor (he
appeared with applause in Barrie’s plays) was
recently called upon to defend a suit brought by
his wife for the restitution of conjugal rights.
Now one has always understood that “Jimmy’*
was the hero of Le Gallienne’s prettiest prose
fancy— ‘ ‘ Borrowed Oysters.” Remember how Le
Gallienne was tempted to take another plat#
with money borrowed from “Jimmy,” and
refrained because an angel warned him that he
was devastating “ Jimmy’s ” bridal bedroom.
Seems, after all, that he might as well have had
nine plates. • *

LIKE HISTORY IT REPEATS ITSELF
As a means of pleasure and sport, the Winchester Automatic
Rifle is as far ahead of any other .22 Caliber as an automobile
is ahead of the historic one-horse shay. After loading this
rifle, all that it is necessary to do to shoot it ten times is to
pull the trigger for each shot. Although automatic in action,
it is simple in construction and not apt to get out of order.
For city, country or camp it is the gun of the day.

Typhoids After Effects.
A Relapse and a Radical Cure.
The Cate of
Mrs. T. VAUGHAN.
(By a Local Reporter.)
Probably many who have hitherto
played the onlooker’s part have been
sharply taught by experience that the
trials'of life possess an arm of far-
reaching propensities, and in such in-
stances, where a personal interest has
been aroused, much pleasure will be
found in reading the conversation
which took place between our repre-
sentative and Mrs. Teresa Vaughan, of
iso. 59 Elizabeth-street, Camperdown,
who said : .
“The first sickness I ever had in my
life came to me six years ago, and it
was a very severe illness, too.’ <
“What was it ?” asked the writer.
“It was an attack of typhoid that
had laid me low, and I had taken a
turn for the better and was getting on
fine when I made the mistake of leav-
ing my bed too soon. A relapse was
the consequence, and, of course, I had
to take to my bed again. I believe 1
was worse then than before, for the
pains which came to my head were
frightful. Those in the house told me
that often 1. was quite delirious, so
that will give you an idea of how bad
I was. This all happened about twelve
months before 1 carhe back to live in
this house, where I was born, and re-
sided till I got married at the age of
eighteen, when I left it and did not
return till five years ago. Now that I
am getting up in years, it is so nice
to be back in the old place again ; but
I’m o-oing away from my story. Well,
I hat! been losing and losing flesh till
at last there was no more to waste
away, nothing being left of me but a
portion of my former self. My stom-
ach was so weak that nothing would
stay down. No, indeed. All I could
take was a little water with either
brandy or milk added, and the general
thing was that as soon as it was down
a terrible retching started, and up it
came again.”
“What an exhausting eSect that must
have had ?” .
“You’re right, indeed ; it did. I was
really as weak as a baby, and as for
even better —well, it was the
last thing 1 thought of. Everybody
who saw me thought that my case was
positively hopeless, and I’m sure I
thought so, too ; but the old sayino-
that ‘while there is life there is hope’
proved to be a true one in my case. It
was when I was so ill that 1 couldn’t
possibly have been wmrse —scarcely able
to move myself, in fact, that a friend
of mine, a lady about seventy, told me
what a grand thing Clements Tonic
was, and that it would be sinful not
to give it a trial. Well, what could I
say ? Nothing had done me any good
so far, so could I expect this one re-
maining remedy to benefit me ? I asked
myself. My friend’s persistent ‘Give it
a trial’ answered the question for me,
so I sent for some Clements Tonic that
day. I don’t sunpose you’ll believe
this, but it is perfectly true, the very
first day I took Clements Tonic the
retching stopped, and if that didn’t
make me joyful nothing would. Oh ! I
was so thankful, for I knew then that
so long as I persevered with Clements
Tonic there was still a hope for me
left. My friends were almost spell-
bound with amazement, and when I
told them that Clements Tonic had al-
so created a feeling of hunger within
me they could hardly believe their
ears, they said. But I had more still
to boast about, for this latest medi-
cine of mine had brought me such ge-
neral relief from pain that it was as
much as I could do to realise that I
was the same woman who so recently
had endured such a great amount of
torture. My chest had been very badly
affected with a weightiness that was
almost unbearable, but in_ a week ° r
two I was quite free from it.”
“When you had taken some solid
food what were your feelings like ?
“Well, at first I did not feel too
comfortable, but after a while, and by
taking Clements Tonic regularly, the
overburdened sensations passed away,
and eventually my stomach became so
strong that I couid eat anything, and
never have the least unpleasantness to
contend with afterwards. Why,, the
agony I used to endure from windy
spasms was something terrible ; but
Clements Tonic eradicated them for
good. Several times a day, too, i was
subject to fits of uncontrollable giddi-
ness —the room seemed to be turning
round and round, and then everything
would go dark for a space ; but even,
to this trouble Clements Tonic proved
to be my staunch and only friend. My
eyes used to feel much larger than they
should have been—so heavy, and so de-
fective in sight, too —and you only
wanted to catch a glimpse of the
whiteness of my tongue to understand
what a disordered state my internal
organs were in. And what a horrible
taste I had in the mouth ! As though
1 had been drinking gall, even after I
had rinsed it out with vinegar and
water, which I often did. But there.:
what a small matter Clements Tonic
made of these things, besides which it
soothed me so well that 1 soon got a
sound rest every night without any of
the fearful dreams that used to ter-
rorise me.”
“Was it long before you were able to
do your work again ?”
“Ah ! some time elapsed before .1
could get about very actively : but it
all came in good time. When I got up
first if I went a little way down the
street, or in the park, for a short
walk, I’d soon have to sit down till I
recovered a bit, and then I’d get home
as soon as I possibly could. But the
strengthening influences of Clements
Tonic were so great that by-and-bye I
could walk three or four miles, and not
feel exhausted, and from the time I
was cured I have not had a day’s ill-
health since.”
“You look very healthy, and not of
a nervous temperament, are you ?”
“Not at all ; but that reminds me.
Oh, dear ! I was almost forgetting to
tell you. Why. nervousness was the
worry of my life in those days, and
would you" believe that I actually
warned my people to always speak
when they came in, for if I turned
round and saw anybody standing in
the room, I would nearly drop. And
how my heart used to palpitate ? And
there were pains around that organ,
too ; so you’ll see how lucky I am to
be alive and well to-day, for when I
started on Clements Tonic I was as
near to the portals of death as I could
stand. I earnestly hope this account
of my recovery will come under the
notice of many delicate people, so
please publish it in whatever way you
think best.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Red-Plumed Hat.
I have loved sweet women many
Since the years gone by,
And as fair they were as any
Underneath the sky;
But when life seems sorrow-laden,
And its wine turns flat,
Comes the vision of the maiden
With the red-plumed hat—
The dear little gokl-haired maiden
With the red-plumed hat.
Years agone in cassock sable,
And in surplice white,
I was serving Father Gabel
As an acolyte;
And mine eyes that went a-roving
Through the sacred gloom
Saw the little maid for loving
With the scarlet plume—
The sweet little maid for loving
With the scarlet plume.
And thenceforth at Mass or Vespers
I beheld her eyes
Shining brighter far than Hesper’s
Light in evening skies ;
And when organ music pealing
Filled the nave and aisle,
O ! I knew where she was kneeling,
And I saw her smile—
Yes, I knew where she was kneeling
With her seraph smile.
To the little church by Tamar
Ev’ry week went she,
And I thought that it became her
To be loved by me.
There is bliss this side of Heaven,
As I learnt to know
In the pleasant land of Devon
In the Long Ago—
In the storied county Devon
In the Long Ago.
And her freckled brother Oisin—
Irish all were we—
O ! I hated him like poison,
But he blackmailed me.
Yet I counted him my brother
And I bribed him free,
For what boy had such another
Sister sweet as she ?
Never boy had such another
Sister sweet as she.
It was on an eve enchanted
When the sun had set,
By the ruin, pixy-haunted,
That our lips first met.
Yea, by Edgecumbe’s ruin olden
We found life was fair—
And a god made music golden
In the charmed air—
Made a magic music golden
In the charmed air.
I am loving now a lady
Who is sweet and kind ;
And, though not so fair as Haidee,
Has a nobler mind.
Yet, when life seems over-laden
With a joy gone flat,
I go dreaming of the maiden
With the red-plumed hat—
The dear little gold-haired maiden
With the red-plumed hat.

Carters.
Once I found myself in Spring-street, just before
the break of day,
Where I met some working devils with a draught-
horse and a dray;
And I asked them what they toiled at, ’mid the
chirping of the birds,
And they mopped their brows and muttered:
“ Can’t y’see, we're carting words 1 ”
Then I humbly begged their pardon, as they
hurried out and in,
For the House was gaily lighted, and those weary
slaves of sin
Staggered out in threes and couples, bearing heavy
slabs like lead.
Which the foreman devil told me were the things
the members said.
So we stood and talked together, while the devils
on the dray
Dashed the politicians’ grammar in a most alarm-
ing way.
And the stories he related, and his antics made
me quail,
For he emphasised each statement with a flourish
of his tail.
“It was bad enough,” he grumbled, “in pre-
Federation days,
When they only had six Houses—it at present
hardly pays.”
Then I asked him “Why continue?” and he
answered me with “ Oh,
You’ll excuse me, but—we utilise this product
down below / ”
Then he called his demons to him, and they
dim bed upon the dray,
And they coiled their tails around them, and—l
really cannot say
Just exactly how they use it, and I’d rather not
surmise.
But the incident is ended, and—that’s how the
matter lies.

THE A.M.P. DIRECTORATE AND ITS
YEARNINGS TO GO TO LONDON.
The directors of the A.M.P. Society have again
broken out with their favorite Sjheme for opening
up a business in Lonion—also in South Africa.
Already they have been decisively informed that
the great bulk of policy-holders do not want to do
business in London, but their desire to sneak the
proposal through seems unquenchable. Prac-
tically the only drawback attached to owning a
policy in the A.M.P. Society is the ceaseless
vigilance necessary to prevent the directors open-
ing an olhce in London while the majority of the
policy-holders are asleep, or away keeping holi-
day. The present attempt represents the desire
of the directors to open an office in London in a
highly aggravated form. They don’t propose to
take a fair, honest vote which will give
both sides of the case exactly the same chance.
The ballot paper—or rather proxy-paper—is
loaded. The vote of the person who says definitely
“No ” will be counted as “No.” The vote of the
person who says definitely “ Yes ” will be counted
as “Yes.” The vote of the person who simply
signs his paper and returns it as an open proxy-
form will also be counted as “Yes”—in other words,
all the votes that should be regarded as informal
will reckon on the side of the directors’ fad. This
is a dodge which, if practised often enough, should
end, _sooner or later, in success for the directors
despite the majority against them. The candi-
date who prescribes the method of election,
supervises the election, picks his own time for
holding the election, sends out his own election
address—but not the other fellow’s address—with
the ballot-papers, and counts the informal or semi-
informal votes as votes in his own favor,
has to be a mighty poor candidate if
he doesn’t win some day. At the same
time, if the directors of the A. M. P. do
carry their point the matter is not necessarily
settled. There may be law proceedings re the
method of decision. Also the other party will
probably start to insist on periodical ballots about
withdrawing from London just as the directors
have done about going there. The habit of
digging up the corpse of a buried topic isn’t a
monopoly.
« • « *
For what possible reason should the A.M.P.
Soc-oty go to London to hustle for bus.noss in a
land of dreadful competition, where its name
wouldn’t be the advertisement that it is in Aus-
tralia, and where it would be practically an out-
sider scrambling among the ruck ? The directors
give a number of alleged reasons for the proposed
extension to England (and also to South Africa),
but not one of them can bear close inspection.
Th,eir utter inability to bear inspection amounts toa
disease, or a disgrace. The first reason assigned is
a tine, comprehensive sample of the Stinking Fish
tendency:—
The practically stationary character of the population
in the Commonwealth, and the absence of a healthy
stream of immigration, and the decline in the birth-rate
all tend to restrict the area of the operations,
and to render the acquisition of new business more
difficult and costly.
It is hardly possible to imagine how more mis-
representation could be crowded into one sentence.
As an example of tight packing the statement is a
curiosity. To begin with, the population ol the
Commonwealth is not “practically stationary”
unless the word “practically” is strained to break-
ing point. This is the record in recent years :
Increase of Population.
1395 .I (54,350 1900 .. 56,020
1896 .. 62,150 1901 .. 60,724
1397 .. 64,650 1902 .. 56,798
1595 .. 46,210 1903 .. 44,085
1899 .. 49,020 1904 .. 57,754
This represents an increase of 501,761 possible
new A.M.P. policy-holders in the last ten years.
If Maoriland is included the results have been
still better :
Increase of Population.
1895 .. 78,930 1900 .. 70,200
1596 .. 77,600 1901 .. 77 704
1897 .. 79,550 1902 .. 77,088
1398 .. 60,610 1903 .. 08,660
1399 .. 62,060 1904 .. 82,788
That represents an increase of 733,170 possible
new A.M.P. policy-holders in ten years, and it is
a growing increase—the last year of the ten was
the best, and the second half of the decade
showed better results than the first.
As regards “ the absence of a healthy stream of
immigration ” it can be answered that, so long as
the population increases at the average rate of
73,317 per annum it doesn’t matter to the A.M.P.
Society whether the increase is through births
or through immigration. In any case, if the fact
that Australasia is only gaining a little by excess
of arrivals over departures is so disastrous to the
society s business, it is a very poor reason for
spreading that business to a country like Britain,
where the immigration statistics are a vast amount
worse,, and where departures enormously exceed
arrivals. As for the poor old birth-rate, the
A.M.P. directors should know, if they know any-
thing, that Australasia has almost the largest
effective birth-rate in the world. The effective birth-
rate is the surplus in proportion to population of
births over deaths—the surplus of children who
survive, and grow up to insure their lives in the
A.M.P. Society. Other countries can show a
larger record of children who are born, and who
promptly die, and become a dead loss to the indus-
trial department, but for children who grow
up and live to pay 40 or 50 or GO
annual premiums to a society whose directors
don’t know when they are well off, Australasia is
almost, if not quite, unrivalled. The statement
that the area of the A.M.P. Society’s operations
is being “restricted” when it is being enlarged
by the addition on the average of over 73,000 pos-
sible customers per annum, comes perilously near
to straight-out Ananias.
* * * *
The dissatisfied directors, in further pursuit of
their case, allege that the average sum insured
under new policies is diminishing and that—
The business now being obtained is of a less stable
character than haj been the case in the past.
if these statements and the one previously quoted
about the increased cost of securing business, are
true, then they cast a grievous doubt upon’ the
reliability of the A.M.P. Society’s annual reports,
which documents have hitherto been regarded
as above suspicion. For these reports show that
the expense rate was lower in 1964 than in 1398,
1899, 1900 or 1903 ; also they show that the new
policies in 1903 and 1904 were, on the average, for
larger sums than those issued in 1900, 1901 and
1902; and, further, they declare that the new
business is more stable and permanent than the
old, instead of less so, and that forfeitures and
surrenders have greatly diminished of late years,
instead of increasing. Why the directors should
throw mud at their own Society by making state-
ments which appear to be flatly contradicted by
their own annual reports it is hard to imagine.
Presumably they did it in a moment of excitement,
when almost any assertion, if it served the purpose
of the moment, looked good enough.
* « * *
The policy-holders are further invited to agree
to the extension because “the mortality experi-
ence among the class of lives assured for large
sums in the United Kingdom is more favorable
than that among the class now accessible to the
Society in the Commonwealth,” and “the cost of
procuring new business in the United Kingdom is
lass than in the Commonwealth.” These are
large, loose and improbable statements, but their
very looseness makes them incapable of absolute
disproof. Still some things that can be proved
are these : (1) That the average length of life in
the United Kingdom is much less than in Aus-
tralia, therefore it is a much worse country on the
whole to do insurance business in ; (2) that there
is hardly one life office in the United Kingdom
which is worked as cheaply as the A.M.P., unless
it is an office which has almost wholly given up
the attempt to get new business—such a one as
the old Equitable of England, which has spent
143 years in getting one-quarter as far forward
as tue A.M.P. has done in a little over half-a-
century.
* * » *
Under these circumstances it may fairly be
st ited that the circular issued by the direc-
tor is a very bad misstatement of the case
—or else that the annual reports, and many
otiier things as well, are most misleading docu-
ments. The extension of the A.M.P.’s business
to England might possibly gratify the vanity of
the directors and other people in charge, for it is
something to be a great insurance potentate in
BuLL’scountry, but to the Australian policy-holders
it promises nothing save loss. By the directors’
own showing the A.M.P. Society, while it stuck
to Australasia, has grown faster than ordinary
life office in the British "empire.. It is,now the
biggest life assurance office in the empire bar one,
and in the accumulation of funds it has got some
£15,009,000 ahead of great English offices that
started nearly a century before it. It is the big-
gest mutual life office in the empire bar none.
It is still growing at a magnificent rate ;
last year its funds increased by nearly £900,000,
anu the number of new policies issued was 14,538.
It lias huge possibilities before it in the way of
industrial assurance —a branch which it has not
hitherto touched. It pays the finest bonuses in
the world for two reasons—its business is done in
a community with about the lowest death-rate on
record, so that it collects, on an average, several
more premiums than the English office does before
it has to pay the claim ; and its money is invested
in a country where interest rates are higher than
they are in the United Kingdom. This is the
splendid record with which the directors profess
to be dissatisfied, and which they disparage, in
order to secure votes for the proposed extension,
by describing it as if it were something akin to
stagnation if not akin to actual retrogression.
* * * *
If the A.M.P. goes to London to do a small
business—in other words, if it is a comparative
failure there—then it isn’t worth while going. If it
goes there and does a large business then the
Australian policy-holders must be heavy cash
losers. On an average people die earlier in Eng-
land—that is to say, they pay fewer premiums
before the claim comes in for payment. Also
insurance funds invested in England yield a
smaller interest return ; there isn’t one office in the
L T nited Kingdom which earns anything like the
A.M.P.’s rate. With less premiums received and
less interest received for every £IOJ that has to be
paid out, profits, and consequently bonuses, are
much lower in England than the A.M.P.’s average
. —this despite the fact that English premium rates
are mostly a shade higher—and, unless the A.M.P.
people reckon that they can teach the veterans of
British life assurance business something quite
new in their own line, the A.M.P. in England
must have the same experience. And the point
for Australian policy-holders to consider is
that they must divide profits with the English
policy-holders. The English policy-holder will
probably get a larger bonus from' the A.M.P.
than an English office could give him, but the
Australian bonus Mull be levelled down so that
the English bonus may be levelled up. The case
of a mutual institution like the A.M.P. is quite
different from that of a proprietary one like the
Bank of N.S.W. If the Bank of JSI.S.W. is
making 3d. in Australia, and it opens a business
in London wdiere it makes Id., though the London
business is the less profitable of the two, still the
institution gains. It makes 4d. for its Australian
shareholders. _ If the A.M.P. Society is making
3d. in Australia, and opens a business in London
by which it makes Id., the position is quite
different. This means 2d. for the Australian
policy-holder and 2d. for the English one.
That will be the inevitable result of success in
London; the larger the success the greater the
adulteration of the good Australian business with
the inferior English business, and the smaller the
profits for Australian policy-holders. The figures
in the balance-sheet will lie larger, but that will
do the Australian policy-holder no good. The
pomp of the managers and directors, as heads of
an institution which does business on three conti-
nents, will be greater, but that also will do the
Australian policy-holder no good. Pomp isn’t
cash. There will be more opportunity for
dragging in allusions to “the empire,” and “the
tie of kinship,” and the “silken bond of brother-
hood ” at the annual meeting, but that also will
be no material benefit to the Australian policy-
holder. Brotherhood isn’t visible coin. The
point for Australians to consider is whether they '
will let well alone or take the chance of over-
balancing themselves while grabbing for the whole
globe. Even the directors who are so anxious for
the extension haven’t the effrontery to directly
promise larger bonuses and better results as a
consequence. It is a case where no gain is pro-
mised and where considerable loss is possible.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
J. C. Wa'ssen’s Back Down.
The Australian Parliament closed its session
leaving the Anti-Trust Bill and the Capital Bite,
Bill among the unfinished remnants. In each
case it was J. C. Watson, leader of the Labor
party, who proposed in a friendly strain that the
House of Peps, should hang its work up and go
home. His defection in each case left the Leakin
Government helpless, and the business was
dropped. J. C. Watson is a moderate and
affable man, and would sooner speak kindly to a
worm than tread on it any day. Apparently it
was his desire to speak pleasantly to the
Tory Opposition that caused him to aban-
don the struggle in each of these cases. A
stronger Prime Minister than Deakin might
have replied that the two measures were essential,
and that they would go through the lieps. before
the session closed or there would be a vacancy for
a new Prime Minister and a new Government ;
but Deakin doesn’t fight on these uncompromising
lines. It would be much better for himself and
for Australia if he did. Unless Deakin aims his
portfolio one of these days at the head of J. C,
Watson, it seems as if the latter gentleman’s
increasing affability will soon make it hardly
possible to achieve anything. The Labor party
is supposed to give support in return for con-
cessions, but the support has been so poor of late
that it is time to remonstrate considerably. In
the matter of the Capital Hites Bill the reason
assigned for another long indefinite wait was
that public feeling in 81.5. W. is agitated at
present, and it is advisable to give it a chance
to cool down. But surely Watson knows
that the excitement is an artificial one, based on
the falsehoods, inventions, and foolish revilingsof
Caiuujthers, and the Sydney Telegraph, and
the old Cabbage-Tree Mob, and all the evidence
goes to show tnat it will go on as long as there is
an unsettled Federal capital question to rave
about. When the Australian Government has
asserted its right by taking possession of the area
required for a Federal territory, and the ensuing
High Court case has been fought, and Carru-
THEIIS has been defeated, and the Federal city is
in actual course of construction, then, after a
great final blast and curse and blither, the excite-
ment will die out. But it will be kept alive and
sedulously fed with falsehoods and slanders
and misrepresentations, as long as there is
a chance that these malign influences will
carry the point. The matter at issue now
is whether the Australian Parliament and the
Constitution are to be supreme, or whether they
are to be overruled by the State Legislature of
Fi.S.W., and the clamors of the importing clique
in Sydney. J. C. Watson proposed that the
Parliament should hesitate for another six months
or so before it decided whether it would cave in to
the Sydney importers or not, and that it should
give the uncivil crowd of importers and paro-
chialists more time to agitate and to bring secret
influences to bear on members.; and with the
Labor party behind him he forced the Govern-
ment to accept this cowardly programme of hesi-
tation. In a man of more force of character the
act would have looked like a shameful treachery
and a gross betrayal of trust; in J. C. Watson’s
case it is only possible to ascribe it to a foohsh and
smiling affability. As for his desertion on the
Anti-Trust Bill it is hard to make even Watson’s
affability cover so great a falling away, but appar-
ently there is hardly any length to which polite-
ness and a tired feeling may not go. It is
a dismal fact that Deakin and Watson never
seem nowadays to have a backbone simultaneously.
A Mysterious Bit of Paper.
That mysterious “memorandum,” said to have
been drawn up by the State Premiers when they
conferred at Melbourne in 1899, has been raised
to the pomp and dignity of a serious issue in the
settlement of the Federal capital. State Premier
Barruthers professes.to regard it as a matter of
great moment, and the papers which support
mm treat, it as throwing quite a new
light on things, and as a State document which
practically over-rules the Constitution and starts
the whole question of the capital afresh. Six
years ago, after N.S.W. had accepted the original
Constitution—the one which left the selection of
the Australian capital entirely to the Parliament
and it§ acceptance had been cancelled and
annulled by the treachery of the State Parliament,
the Premiers appointed themselves a committee to
revise things, and met in conference, and evolved
among them that famous clause 125 which has
been a cause of dissension, riot, and ill-feeling
ever since. It reads as follows :
The seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be
determined by the Parliament, and shall be within terri-
tory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the
Commonwealth, and if New South Wales be an Original
State shall be in that State and be distant not less than
One Hundred Miles from Sydney.
Such territory shall contain an area of NOT less than
One Hundred Square Miles, &c. ■
Jn strict obedience to this clause the Australian
Parliament selected an area of not less than 100
square miles situated not less than 100 miles
from Sydney, and there, it would seem, the question
legally ends. But the present N.S.W. Government
demands that it shall “determine” the situation
of the capital itself and it has recently reinforced
a cloud of hazy argument and confused aspersion
by the discovery of a rough memo, said to have
been left behind them by the Premiers in ’99.
This scrap of paper has something on it about the
capital being “at a reasonable distance from
Sydney,” and the Carrutheks party alleges, on
its own authority, that llalgety is at an unreason-
able distance. Exactly what this memo., or scrap
of paper, or old envelope has to do with the case
doesn’t appear. Its contents are not in the Con-
stitution which the people accepted. They
weren’t mentioned to the people till the other
day, and six years is a long interval. And
if the Constitution is to be altered, or
interpreted afresh by reason of old me-
moranda that turn up suspiciously after
years of concealment, there will never be any
fixed Constitution at all, for there is always the
chance of a paper being found which explains the
view which George Turner, or Mark Foy, or
the Balmain Ferry Co. took of some clause in the
long ago, and the new light thus thrown on the
clause may upset many things. The best thing
Australia can do under these circumstances is to
stick to the Constitution it accepted, and drop
extraneous documents like the Premiers’ memo,
into the fire. . As things are, it knows where to
find its Constitution, but if it accepts Carkutuers’
new theory its Constitution will be partly in the
Statute Book and partly scattered all over the
waste-paper baskets and ash-bins of Australia.
The White Sugar Eebate.
If Joe Cook and Wilks and the rest of the ob-
structionist crowd had not wasted mpst of the
session in barking and snarling, the Common-
wealth Parliament would not have been bustled at
the last moment into such unsatisfactory amend-
ments of the Sugar Bonus Bill. As matters stand,
the Parliament lias simply played into the hands
of the anti-Federal crowd, and all because Joe
Cook robbed it of the time to calmly consider the
whole matter. Without that time for considera-
tion, Australia’s old disease of putting up with a
makeshift asserted itself. The Australian, if you
don’t give him time to think, wants the whole
building up at once, even if he has to paste a bill-
of-sale on the front dooT and an I O U on the back.
He isn’t satisfied to build by degrees; he can't
wait. Ihe German knows that a man won’t go
into an industry that needs Protection aud
requires a large outlay unless he is assured
of Protection for a reasonable time, so the
tariff is fixed for seven years or more. The
Australian puts on a duty, and its Jge Cooks
look round the next day for the factory, and when
they don’t see it they go to the House and make 14
speeches to deride Protection, When the Com-
monwealth decided that Tommy Tanna must
leave the Queensland sugar-fields—in the interests
of a White and so that the British
blood that some people profess to hold in rever-
ence might not be,contaminated—it decided that
the white sugar-grower should be helped through
with what was wrongly called a bonus. It was not
a gift grabbed out of the pocket of the taxpayer,
An excise duty was put on sugar, and part of this
excise was remitted to the white grower. The
scheme has worked very well in the past three
years, considering the tremendous difficulties and
prejudices that had to be faced. The supply of
reliable white labor to displace the Kanakas was
not large. Local conditions at the mills and on the
farms were abominable. That, in fact, was the
strong reason why the Kanaka had to go—he was
content to live in surroundings which stamped
him as a most undesirable neighbor. The white
was expected to step in and put up with the same
conditions; and if he had been satisfied to do it, then
he would have been no better than Tanna, and
Tanna might almost as well have stayed. So the
displacement of the black by the white must be a
gradual process ; and the introduction of the best
kind of white must bo more gradual still. The man
who loves Tanna and wants to keep him says the
white is not fit for the work. The man who comes
raw from the south no doubt would find it severe;
and he must be paid for undergoing the severity.
By-and-bye he will become used to it, and
will prefer it, just as the man who lives on
the parched plains at the back o’ Bourke prefers
his climate to any other Australia can offer. But
the fact is that the men suffer in these places far
less than the women ; and the men must be paid
something extra to improve the conditions for the
women while the acclimatisation proceeds. (As
to those born in the north, the chances are
they would want to be paid extra to go
south to work.) All those changes must take years
to evolve ; and, while they are in progress, the
industry must be helped. Yet when the matter
of the sugar “bonus” came up, the Senate set itself
against that practical scheme for preserving a great
industry and a white Australia at the same time,
and the Government (with only a few hours to run
to the end of the session) suggested a compromise
to save the Bill. So the Compromise was bushed
through—the rebate of the excise on white-grown
sugar for four years, after that a reduced rebate
for two years, then no rebate at all. It
would have been far better had Parliament
only dealt with the first four years, and left it
to the House at the end of that time to say
whether the rebate should be continued or not. As
it is, the Act looks like finality, whereas, of cou.se,
it is nothing of the sort; it will still be open to the
Parliament three or four years hence to continue
the full rebate. The danger now is that, believing
Parliament has said the last word on the question,


the Northern sugar-grower will not risk continuing
in the business, seeing that he cannot be at an
sure that it will pay without the rebate after so
brief a time. Queensland has, therefore, good
reason to be disappointed with the Australian
Parliament’s compromise. But it assumes too
much when it assumes that the last legislative
word has been spoken about the business, it got
the rebate in the first place easily enough ; it has
got a renewal of it for four years easily enough ;
and it can be reasonably certain that, in spite of
this rushed Bill, it will get another full-rebate
extension if, after three years, the circumstances
call for it. The broad franchise of both Common-
wealth Houses is the best of guarantees that
justice will be done.

The Prorogation Speech—Some Omissions.
There were many things left out of the Federal
prorogation speech. This is an effort to supply
some of the more glaring omissions :
Gentlemen, —
(1) I am glad to te able to release you from your
arduous labors. They are arduous anyhow, but they have
been made much more arduous than necessary by the
offensive garrulity of Joseph Cook, Willie Kelly, Willis,
Conroy, and several other persons of the same type, who
have distinguished themselves by a passionate opposition
to all legislation designed to place restrictions upon
greed and dishonesty in commercial life.
(2) In spite of these persons, however, you have
managed to enact a number of useful measures, and have
been brilliantly successful in neglecting many more of
still greater importance.
(3) One of the most solid gains made possible by Feder-
ation was some uniform and determined policy with
regard to the accursed debt of over £200,000,000, which
hangs like a pall over Australia. You have, or could get,
the power to adopt a policy which would mean a large
reduction of the interest charge, and a steady reduction
in the debt itself. You have talked a good deal about
this, but have done nothing. You have not even done
enough to throw the responsibility of failure on to the
State Governments. It is true that you cannot take over
the whole debt without an amendment of the Constitu-
tion. But you haven’t tried to amend the Constitution,
nor to do what can be done without amendment.
(4) You have talked a good deal about encouraging im-
migration, but you have done nothing practical to en-
courage it. It is true that you can’t bring agricultural
immigrants here unless there is land for them, and that
practically the whole of the useful land in Australia is
locked up in the hands of private monopolists. It is true
also that the States’ Governments refuse to make this
land available. That fact makes it your business to open
up the land by a heavy graduated land-tax, which you
have the power to do. But you haven’t done it. You
haven’t even tried to do it. Indeed, the probability is
that most of you would hold up your hands in horror at
the suggestion. Nevertheless, you would have been much
more usefully employed in doing this than in voting
£25,000 for a memorial to Queen Victoria.
(5) The Northern Territory, one of the richest assets of
Australia, has been mismanaged by South Australia for
40 years. Its resources are wholly undeveloped, and
instead of adding millions a year to the wealth of Aus-
tralia, it adds £lOO,OOO a year to its debt. You have the
power to take it over, to develop its resources, to settle
it with white immigrants, to make it a valuable defensive
barrier against a possible future inrush of Asiatics. But
it remains just what' it always has been —an incubus
instead of an asset, a danger instead of a defence. You
have done many useful things this session. But a
measure to secure the efficient control and development
of the Northern Territory would have been worth all, and
more than all, you have done.
(6) The defence system of Australia is in a state of
chaos. You have done nothing to reduce it to order.
As for land defence, the majority of you seem to have no
clear and definite idea even of the principle upon which
your land defence system should he constructed. Naval
defence is worse than chaotic. It is based on a principle
which is wholly wrong, embodied in an agreement which
has been deliberately and consistently broken by the
Imperial Government. The remnant of the Australian
local naval force is dispirited and disorganised. You have
done nothing to improve it.
(7) The whole problem of the relations between
Australia and the Pacific Islands remains unsettled.
Some time ago, in a spirit of Brummagem Imperialism,
the Commonwealth took over New Guinea, and reached
out for a share in the New Hebrides by subsidising mail
services, and encouraging Australians to take up land
there. You have indeed established a Constitution for
New Guinea, but its administration remains in a State of
hopeless disorganisation.
(8) You have left the capital business unsettled. The
fact that J, Carrutiiers has done his best to block a
settlement does not absolve you from your responsibility.
The fuss now being made in N.S.W. is mostly dishonest
and wholly provincial and petty, but it is a great pity
that you should give little puppy dogs like Carrutiiers
even the appearance of a reason for yelping. Anyhow,
the Constitution provides that the capital shall be in
N.S.W., and it is quite time that the capital was there
whether Carrutiiers yelps or not.
(9) The tariff question—a matter of the greatest possible
urgency—hasn’t been touched.
(10) The fact is, you appear to be lacking in the sense
of proportion. The Union Label, Trade Descriptions,
Jury Exemptions, Secret Commissions are all important
matters, but there are other things more important. You
would have been better employed during the session if
you had concerned yourselves with the more important.
It will be time enough for you to bother about the others
when you have formulated and carried into law a policy
which has some claim to be called Australian.
(10) I now declare this Parliament prorogued, with the
fervent hope that one half of you I may never see any
more, and that the other half will turn up next year in a
more energetic spirit and start to do tilings instead of
merely talking about them.

Some Tariff Facts.
“ Malle ” writes from London :
The only way to secure a fair measure of reciprocity
with this country is to keep on spanking Bull’s exports
with a tariff, the higher the better. This may bring the
Free-Fooders to some semblance of reason. When Cham-
berlain spoke at Glasgow two years ago, and proposed
the 2s. per quarter on foreign corn, wheat was 265. 6d. per
quarter. All last year it ruled at 31s. 6d. and bread was
no dearer, but in spite of this practical object-lesson, the
big loaf lie is as rampant as ever. Two nights ago a
Foreign-trader, speaking at Hampstead, where there is a
bye election, said : “ Which are you going to have, the
big beef steak you have now, or dog-meat sausages ? ”
and the crowd, hardly one of whom sees a beefsteak in a
year, yelled approval. The same threadbare lie “ that
the consumer always pays the duty” is heard on every
Foreign-trade platform—yet, as far” back as 1834, when
the duty was 345. 6d. per quarter, and there was no
American, Australian, or Indian competition to keep
prices down, wheat sold at only 4s. Sd. per quarter above
the duty, and for years only averaged 10s. above it.
Recently a deputation of Birmingham brass-workers—
including Davis, the secretary, a rabid anti-Chamberlain-
ite—visited Berlin to inquire into the conditions of the
trade there. They visited a school in the poorest dis-
trict, and found that, though the directors had funds
available to feed hungry children, they found no necessity
to use them ; and the children were better nourished,
better clothed, and cleaner than at any Birmingham
school. The minimum wage in Berlin was 275. per week,
and maximum 425. In Birming'ham the minimum is 235.,
and maximum runs up to 605., but the latter is not really
wages, the worker being allowed to employ improvers.
, found the German workmen better housed, better
ted, better clothed, and more sober than the English ;
and, altogether, the report—which is published in book"
torm at Is.—should convince anyone not blinded by pre-
judice of what Protection and a decent land system do
lor the worker.

is amalin°J ailC l’ p r?-i udi ce and credulity of these people
is amazing, I attended a meeting in Suffolk, com-
nosed chiefly of cocoa-mat makers—an industry that has
been almost wiped out by Belgian competition. Under
the local trade union rule, the work is mostly piece-work
—no man is allowed to earn more than 14s. per week, and
he is lucky if he averages 10s. A local Baptist parson
spoke of the German’s dog-sausage, under Protection, and
the mutton chop the British workman had for breakfast,
and these poor devils cheered. He said that the average
German wage was 19s. a week, and the average British
wa«-e 325., and they nearly lifted the roof. Yet not a
workman there had ever earned a pound a week in his
life
I went over the silk factory at Sudbury— Gainsborough’s
old house. Thirty years ago the owner employed 400
weavers : now he has 40, and he explained be keeps them
going on scraps. A hundred or so yards of a certain
pattern is wanted, the French or American manufacturers
will not bother to set a loom for it, so he gets it. The
maximum wage paid to a woman is 125., and to a man £1
a week for 66 hours’work.
Local farm laborers receive 12s. a week, out of which
they pay Is. 6d. a week rent. Their wives often work hand-
looms or do horsehair work, and by hard graft earn 7s. a
week for an amount of work they received 18s. for 15
years ago. At Brighton recently, while conducting a
Tariff Reform meeting, I was asked, “Mr. Chamberlain'
says he don’t mean to put no duties on raw' material—how
is that going to help us w'orkmen, mister?” When told
by putting the difference of value between the raw mate-
rial and the manufactured article into the British manu-
facturer’s and British workman’s pocket, he retorted,
“ Why if we stop the Germans from making things for us
in their country, they’ll flock over here and go to our
masters and offer to work for half what we get.” In an
experience of some 70 public meetings all over England,
I have hardly heard a sensible question, or a relevant in-
terjection, and only one witty one. Leading politicians
display either a lamentable ignorance of up-to-date poli-
tical economy, or deliberately mislead the public with
statements they know to be false. Rosebery can outdo
our own Reid. Some months ago he addressed an
Edinburgh audience, and informed them that “if
Mr. Chamberlain’s proposals were carried, food w’ould
be so dear that millions of those now hovering on
the brink of starvation would be over the edge.”
Four hours afterwards he addressed a meeting of farmers,
and started: “Mr. Chamberlain does not propose to
tax wheat from the colonies, and the 2s. a quarter duty
will so stimulate production there that } 7 ou will have
worse competition to face than you have now’.”
Land bought 30 years ago at £BO per acre in Suffolk
cannot now be sold for £2O, and, last year, a farm of 105
acres, g’ood wheat land, w'ith a large house and all out-
buildings thereon, within three miles of a station and
within 50 miles of London, sold for £6OO. Plenty of com-
modious farm and other country houses, with gardens,
orchards, &e., can be rented at £l2 to £l4 per annum.
Yet, despite the awful price paid for this insane policy of
free imports, things all-round are cheaper in Australia.
A better meal can be got in Sydney for Is. than here for
2s. 6d. Boots, haberdashery, &c., are dearer here, and a
good suit costs the same as in Australia.
The Anti-Trust Bill.
Tm;.Anti-Trust Bill has been postponed, despite
the fact that Prime Minister Dkakin was a little
less affable about it than usual. It is to come on
again next session, and then it is to be hoped that
it will be pushed through for all it is worth. The
object of the Bill is to deal with the “ dumping ”
evil—a matter that is not so well understood by
the multitude as it should be, considering that it
is an attack on the very life of Australian indus-
try. Dumping can only be practised by countries
with a large population and an ironclad Protec-
tionist tariff. When the manufactureis in these
countries have fully supplied their own market,
some combine which does an immense trade in a
certain article looks for a foreign outlet, and pos-
sibly selects Australia. It doesn’t propose simply
to compete in an ordinary way with local makers,
and get part of the trade, which is a slow process
and yields only moderate p.ofits. It prefers, with
a big effort, even though it involves heavy
expense, to extinguish competition utterly and
get all the profit. It is willing either to
pay its rivals to shut up, or to lose so
many thousands or hundreds of thousands or
millions of dollars in shutting them up. Either
way it regards the outlay as the price paid for the
goodwill of the Australian business, and when it
gets all the business by killing competition it
reckons on making up the loss. Till it has killed
off the local manufactures it sells at ridiculous
prices against which the local maker, with cnly Iris
local market to depend on, can’t compete. When
he is killed off, his capital lost and his workmen
sent to join the unemployed, and the foreigner
has got the market, prices go up to make good
the loss and to bring in a handsome profit. If
competition starts again, which, after one experi-
ence, isn’t likely, the prices go down till the new
competitor is also ruined; then they rise once
more. They always rise sufficiently to cover the
previous fall—and more. The American dumper,
when he is doing a good, steady, profitable busi-
ness with 80,000,000 people in his own country,
can afford to supply 4,000,000 people at a loss—
even a big loss—for a little while in order to per-
manently secure their market. Of course, if the
Australian tariff was a 100 per cent, one, and a
duty of that size had to be added to the loss,
it might become too serious a proposition, but
then Australia hasn’t sense enough to enforce a
100 per cent, tariff. And Australia can’t retaliate
by dumping its goods into the United States
for three reasons. First, our industries are not
large enough yet to fight the huge American
undertakings on their own ground. Second, the
American tariff, unlike ours, is too high to admit
of much in that way. Third, even if Australian
manufactured goods got into the States, the com-
bines there have great influence over the railways,
and would promptly put impossible railway
charges on Australian goods, while Australia
gives the foreigners’ goods the run of its lines on
much the same terms as anybody else. The pro-
cess pursued by the American combine, when it
sets out to capture a new market in its own parti-
cular line, is an industrial war of extermination.
The combine’s position in America being fortified
against all outside attack, Australia has to fight
on the defensive all the time, and the combatant
who is always on the defensive always
loses in the end. We can’t “carry the
war into Africa,” as Scipio did. The
Anti-Trust Bill does not interfere with ordinary
competition. If a foreigner can make an article
at half the cost of the Australian he may, so far
as this Bill is concerned, undersell the Australian
for all time. But when he sells far below cost, or
far below the price he charges elsewhere, and it is
obvious that it is only a temporary price—which
is cut absurdly low to kill off a local industry, and
which must be raised enormously to make good
the loss as soon as that industry is killed—then the
Bill gives the Minister power, after a committee
of inquiry has reported that the case calls for
action, to take drastic measures. These measures
may even go the length of prohibiting the im-
portation of the article in question. It is a
perfectly fair device, and if it is a new one that
is simply because the evil is new, and new evils re-
quire new remedies. The battle-axe was a mighty
weapon once, but it is out of date now, and com-
mercial means of defence become out of date as well
as battle-axes. When Pieupoint Morgan resolved
to buy up and control all the Atlantic steamship
lines, even the British Government had to get out
of its rut and take just as unusual measures as
Minister Lyne proposes. And in our case the
need is greater because the odds are far greater.
Moreover in the shipping business Britain was
the veteran trader fighting a comparative novice,
while in industrial competition with America this
country is the comparative novice fighting the
veteran. When Britain, with a century of marine
supremacy behind it, had to take extraordinary
measures to fight the U.S. trust Australia needn’t
be ashamed that it also finds extraordinary
measures necessary.
No License Needed.
At the fag-end of the N.S.W. session, among 10
bushels of papers which were fired at the Assem-
bly was the report of a committee appointed in
January, 1904, “to consider what steps should be
taken to minimise the risk of fire and the danger
of panic in theatres, public halls, and other places
of public concourse.” The Assembly had most
likely forgotten that the committee was ever-
appointed—the report was called for in a panic
after the Iroquois Theatre disaster in New York ;
and an Assembly can forget 100 corpses, roasted in a
foreign country, in much less than two years. More-
over, a tired Assembly which was anxious to get
home to the Christmas fowl wasn’t likely to
scratch among 10 bushels of reports on the off-
chance of finding something it had forgotten.
Therefore the committee’s announcement that the
licensing of theatres and places of amusement in
N.S.W. is a farce and may easily be a tragedy,
didn’t receive any attention worth mentioning.
A Public Entertainments Act was passed in 1897 ;
but it was a mere consolidation of two ancient
statutes, passed years before the modern theatre
and the modern entertainment were seriously
thought of; so the date, 1897, tagged on to the
N.S.W. law on tl.e subject is a delusion and a
snare to begin with. The only supervision pre-
scribed by this antiquated law masquerading
under a modern date is for “ theatrical perfor-
mances” ; and a theatrical performance, it seems,
doesn’t include half the performances which the
public pays to see. Thus the proprietors of the
Lyceum Theatre, the committee reports
having- made no attempt to effect the necessary improve-
ments, no license has therefore been issued, and tl.e pre-
mises are now closed as a theatre. The building ha",
however, been open on several occasions fer public enter-
tainments of a non-theatrical character.
It is open now. More than that, it is open for a
cinematograph entertainment; and, though no
doubt the people who run this particular cine-
matograph know liow to manage it, yet the fact
remains that a cinematograph entertainment is
probably five times more dangerous from the point
of view either of fire or of panic than the average
other theatrical draw. In the first place, it is
conducted in darkness; in the second place,
it involves the use of explosive oils or gases. Yet
a building which is not regarded as being safe
enough to be licensed for the entertainment that
isn’t dangerous, can be hired out and used for
entertainments that probably involve very serious
danger. Worse still, in the case of the Lyceum,
portions of the building have been turned into a
“home” for the accommodation of youngsters
from factories and elsewhere; and that adds-to
the risk both ways—it adds to the peril of the
people who go into the theatre, no doubt in the
belief that it wouldn’t be called a theatre if it
were not licensed, and that it wouldn’t be licensed
if it were at all ri.ky ; and it adds to the peril
of the youngsters, v. ho don t yet know what
danger from five and panic is. Apparently,
in the present state of the law in N.S.W.,
there isn’t anything to prevent an amateur show-
man hiring a room over a powder factory or a
kerosene store, calling it a theatre, inviting the
public to ccme in and pay its shillings as it passe;;
through the dcor, and then letting off crackers for
their entertainment. When they have had an
arm and an ear blown off, and find that one eye
and a leg have been mislaid somewhere, they
probably won’t miss them any the less because
the fool-law says that they didn’t lose them at a
“theatrical performance.” And if they can
afterwards get their breath they will probably ti 1:
J. Carruthers that he could be a lot better em-
ployed fixing up a rotten law of this sort than
yelping about State frights and grievances.
o
The Deportation of Aliens.
The question whether the Australian Government
has the power to deport undesirable aliens has
provided a good many people with an opportunity
for talking nonsense. The Argus, a little while
ago, provided a good specimen of the kind of argu-
ment which is good enough for the nigger-lover.
A Canadian Judge had held that the Canadian
Government had no power to deport aliens, and
that the law which purported to enable it to do
so was ultra vires. An Argus writer immediately
showed that it followed from this decision that
Australia had no power to deport Kanakas or any-
body else. Now the glee of the Argus is only
justified if one makes three pretty large assump-
tions, which no one but a fool would be prepared
to make. These are : (1) that the decision of tho
Canadian Judge is right; (2) that the powers or
the Australian Government are, in respect to this
subject, no greater than those of the Canadians ;
and (3) that, supposing assumptions 1 and 2 to be
right, it is impossible to frame legislation in such
a way. as to evade the difficulty raised by the
Canadian Judge. The decision is merely the
decision of a single Judge of a provincial court,
and is in no sense authoritative. Anyhow, as was
pointed out in a recent number of the Weekly
Notes —a legal paper which doesn’t allow its poli-
tical sympathies to influence its legal opinions—
whether Australia can deport aliens or not, it can
certainly give the undesirable ones the alternative
of perpetual imprisonment, or taking their passages
at the public expense to some other country. It’s
not hard to imagine which side of the alternative
the average undesirable would choose. If Aus-
tralia gets rid of him, it really doesn’t matter
much whether the Government deports him or he
deports himself.
♦
A Label for Shoddy.
The Maorilanders who make woollen goods are
wrestling with the problem of shoddy. Using
nothing but pure fleece, the M.L. mills can’t com-
pete with the foreign stuff that no sheep would
recognise if he met it in the street. The Mosgiel
Co., about the oldest in the country, used to be
able to pay a fair 7 or 8 per cent, dividend ; for
the past year it paid 3J per cent., and even that
was only managed by wearing out plant and pay-
ing nothing towards the cost of it. Two other
mills have done worse ; they have lately had to
shut up altogether. A higher duty would help the
industry a bit, but most Maoriland wool-men doubt
whether any increase they are likely to get would
help them enough. The trouble is, not only that
labor conditions are fairer than they are where the
foreign stuff comes from, but that the foreign stuff
isn’t wool. , Mapriland all-wool tweed, costing 3s.
a yard to make, has to compete with shoddy,
made to exactly represent it to outward appear-
ance, which costs from Is. up to Is. lid. A 100
per cent. ; duty would be just about enough to give
the local man a fair show under these conditions ;
but the Maoriland wool-man, who is mostly Mac-
Something, and very practical, asks what hope
there is of getting a 100 per cent, duty before
thistles grow on the factory floors. And, anyhow,
a 100 per cent. Customs duty, though it would be
mighty effective, is calculated to give a wrong
impression. Article for article, quality for
quality, the Maorilander doesn’t need any
100 per cent, protection ; and the question is
whether the Bruce Smith sort of person, who
talks about “spoon-fed industries,” ought to be
obliged with a 100 per cent, duty to point his moral
with. The public isn’t charged 500 per cent, more
for arsenic than for flour so that it shall not eat
arsenic instead of flour ; the arsenic is simply
labelled “poison.” And it seems that, for a
start, the same thing ought to be done with every
rag of shoddy which comes into the country. If
that isn’t done, then the Australian and Maoriland
mills will either have to shut up or turn out shoddy
too ; and that will be an unequal struggle, because
there isn't a sufficient supply of infected rags here
to make shoddy with. In any case, however, the
making of shoddy should be the very last alterna-
tive. The Australian and Maoriland woollen
mill, up to now, has kept its reputation for
honesty very well indeed ; and that reputation is
about the. last thing that Australia and Maoriland
should help it to shed. Yet these countries are
almost forcing the mills to shed their honesty by
allowing the foreign lie to come in without com-
pelling it to brand itself as a lie upon its back.
The Union Label, which the Commonwealth Par-
liament has been debating, is a fair-sized thing ;
but, after all, it is a much bigger thing to know
the difference between the foreign shoddy, which
can be sold here at Is. or 25., and the local all-wool,
which cannot be sold at under 3s. The Union
Label by all means ; but let us have the Shoddy
Label as well.

A White Woman.
An Australian just returned from S’Africa tells
The Bulletin some startling things in connection
with the Chinese slave-traffic in that misfortunate
land. When the Jewish plunderers had obtained
their cheap Chinese slaves, the question arose
about importing Chinese women for them.
These, however, could not be obtained ;
the Viceroys discouraged the idea, and women
steadfastly refused to go to Chowth Africa.
Then the Jews proposed to import an Asiatic
sisterhood from Japan, but even the Monkey
kicked at the idea of exporting women for the use
of underground slaves, who were mostly mur-
derers and bandits in their own country.
Cohen then tried to call in the Kaffir girl,
but the Kaffir men greeted him with a
meat-axe, and so much general riot occurred
that Cohen had to give up that idea also.
Yet his Chinese slaves demanded women, and as
black women cost too much bloodshed, and, yellow
women were not obtainable, what about whites ?
Cohen had no beastly pride of race, and he was a:;
ready to prostitute white women to his Chinese
scum as he was to murder white men to get the
cheap agony. The slums of every S’African ton u
were scoured, and the most degraded women in tljc
land were given free railway passages and enough
money to get to Jew’burg. But in all S’Africa
there were not enough degraded females
to nearly supply the demand, and Cohen tool;
off his coat and boldly went in for recruitin"
prostitutes in the slums of English and Contn
nental cities. They were sent to Africa, aiul
supplied with enough money to evade tho
law against destitute persons, ard other
means were used to get over the “ undesir.
able clauses, and the awful oargo finally
The Fool’s Paradise.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Our cattle camp in many a field,
Our spacious lands are tamed and tilled ;
We sow, but who shall reap ? And who
Shall dwell within the homes we build ?
Our blood is red with youth and pride,
We dance and laugh and sing and play.
The sun is high, our hearts are light,
The night is far and it is day.
We do not heed the rising storm,
Nor fear the coming thunder-stroke,
But trifle with the Fates and jest—
A land of fond and foolish folk.
Our council halls are packed with fools
Who quarrel in the public view,
And bicker—truthless and unwise,
When we most need them wise and true.
We count our gold, and boast our wealth,
And praise our worth in glittering words—
Where are the men to keep it ours,
And where the ships and guns and swords ?
The wrongs within our reach we slay
(’Tis well—’tis noble work, no doubt);
We rout the foes within our house,
But do not heed the foes without.
What shall it profit all our hopes,
And all the effort we (xpend,
If others eat the ripened fruit,
And seize our substance in the end ?
How can we build with any heart,
Or add, rejoicing, stone to stone,
When they who need may come at will
And claim, and keep, and make their own ?
What lawyer-craft shall hold at bay
The gleaming legions, war-bediglit ?
What test of tongues shall then avail
To keep our glorious country white ?
We guard our gardens, fence our fields,
Bar doors, bolt windows high and low;
Our coasts invite the host.le fleet,
Our ports lie open to the foe.
Should ever gathering hosts attempt
The might of Britain’s power to clip,
Her right shall be to every man,
And every gun, and evmy ship.
If such a moment should befall,
Where, then, were we who prate and boast
Before the world ? How should we guard
Our fenceless towns and shipless coast ?
Bed blood would flow and towns would bum,
And foes would enter at our gate,
And we would slave for alien lords—
Dethroned, cast down, and desolate !
Lest these things be, let us awake—
Build ships, forge swords, and fashion guns ;
Our land’s best hope resides w.th.'n
The strength and valor of her sons.

London Morning Post lately complained
that the British Admiralty had decided to dis-
pense with submarine mines for coastal defence
purposes, and to depend solely upon submarine
boats and torpedo boats, in which lines of craft
the navy is very weak. For the present the coast
of Britain is not properly protected. Most of the
torpedo boats are of antiquated pattern, carrying
feeble 14in. torpedoes, that wouldn’t suffice to
sink a big battle ship even if they were permitted
to get there.

portion of the town practically given up to them,

month from each Chinaman’s wages for their re-
muneration. The women complain that the com-
panies rob them by paying over only a small per-
centage of the money obtained from the Chinamen,
and demand the right to make their own terms
with the individual Chinese. Some of the com-
panies have granted the right, but others stick to
the original practice, and there is a chance that
the moral sense of the Empire may be outraged
by seeing Cohen sued in the courts by his slaves’
prostitutes for the full price of their degradation.
In the meantime the Yoshiwarra is worked in the

Seddon’s Mixed Support.
A Maorilander tries to sort things out: —
What Seddon will do with his majority is a question of
absorbing anxiety. Pledged to break up the huge estates,
he will have to do something to satisfy the many candi-
dates returned on that ticket; and the prospect that the
available cash will not go round is probably causing
Seddon some mental anguish. Then, while there is one
lot clamoring for the purchase of estates at almost any
cost, there is another lot that wants to break the borrow-
ing habit ; and so these two lots hardly play speaks.
Further, the land question is complicated by the return
of a heavy preponderance of freeholders ; yet Seddon’s
party includes some enthusiastic leaseholders. It is a
marvellous thing that all these elements should be in one
part} 7 ; yet, at any rate, they are behind Seddon —for the
time. Heaven only knows what will come out of this
medley ; but these few points seem to sort themselves
out of the chaos :
(1) Seddon is pledged to pile on the graduated Land
Tax and the Absentee Tax. If these operate to such an
extent as is expected, the owners will cut up without
further persuasion, and that will go a good way to save
the situation. Already in the Wellington district, it is
reported, some large landholders are getting in early, in
view of the anticipated over supply.
(2) The freehold majority suggests the enactment of a
brand-new set of land laws, on the Danish principle,
which limits every holding to a specified area ; and though
the leaseholders don’t like it, they admit that that is
better than freehold plain and simple.
(3) Contemporaneous with the freehold, an extension
of the Advances to Settlers office is regarded as necessary
to keep down the rates of interest and discourage the
local Cohen from acquiring the land per dummy.
And (4) although Seddon has promised a “ free breakfast
table,” through the almost complete eradication of the
large squatter element from the present House, the
Protectionist section has been strengthened. At present
the Maoriland tariff, though better than the Australian,
is a hybrid, and its revision seems likely.

One theory advanced by State Premier Carru-
thers is that the Australian Government doesn’t
require more than 100 or 200 square miles of
territory for a Federal capital, for it need not
have a reservoir or water supply or water catch-
ment area at all. These things can be in N.S.W.
under Joseph’s control and supervision, and if
the Australian Government finds the capital city’s
water supply deficient or dirty, it can come and
humbly see Joe about it, and Joe will put the
matter right if he feels that way, and otherwise
he won’t. Of course, if the capital’s water supply
is to be kept clean, the water catchment area will
be of no use to N.S.W., for it will be impossible
to allow settlement on it, and in these circum-
stances the bit of ground might as well be handed
over. But the N. S. W. State Government
would lose the joy of making the Aus-
tralian Parliament and Federal city feel
their dependence, of quarrelling about water
rights, of making sudden discoveries that
great injuries have been done to N.S.W., of
making unexpected demands for payment for the
use of the rain that falls in N.S.W. territory, and
of threatening to cut off the water supply of the
Federal capital if they are not immediately paid.
And to a certain order of mind —the mind that is
commonly associated with the master of a small
commercial academy—these are blessed privileges
and not to be lightly parted with. So Carruthers
demands to control the water supply of the Aus-
tralian capital, though there will be not a penny
of profit for N.S.W. in doing so, and urges that
the whole question shall be dealt with in a “broad
spirit”. Would Carruthers know a “broad
spirit” even if one came into his office and tendered
him 6s. Bd. ?

The Pure Food Act, which passed the Victorian
Parliament at the tail end of the session, after
being hacked about and considerably damaged by
the reactionary House of Rich Landlords, has
still many possibilities of good, and should go a
long way to suppress the adulteration and swind-
ling that seem to have become bone and marrow
of present-day food supply. _ Briefly, all articles
are deemed adulterated if mixed or diluted with
substances prejudicial to the purchaser or in a
proportion which diminishes their food value or
nutritive properties, or which contain any sub-
stance of a lower commercial value than them-
selves, or which do not comply with the standard
fixed. Such articles are deemed misdescribed if a
label contains any statement false, incorrect or mis-
leading as to the article’s name, quality, strength,
purity, composition or age. The chief virtue of
the Act lies in the fact that there will henceforth
be.no, dispute among alleged experts as to whether
such adulterants as salicylic acid or barium chloride
are desirable drugs or mere frauds. A Standard
of Purity is to be fixed by a Standards Committee,
consisting, not of representatives of ‘‘interests,”
but of medical, scientific, producing and
manufacturing experts. All articles that on
analysis fail to reach the standard are at
once thereby condemned. Also the Act com-
pels the dirty, lazy, shiftless municipal coun-
cils to have a certain number of tests made
each year—they can have as many more as they
like if they really want pure food—so the track of
at least the most flagrant adulterators should pre-
sently be more rocks than velvet. Further, the
Act compels, except in the case Of specially
exempted articles, the setting forth of the correct
weight, measure or volume on all packages; and
from J une 30th, ’O6, the manufacture or sale of
textile substances and leather used in human
clothing containing arsenic, lead, antimony, or
barium in any form, or containing an; other sub-
stance which may be prohibited by regulation, is
made illegal. If that Act is well administered, it
will compensate for a whole multitude of Bent’s
bellows and blunders.

The decision of the Australian Pai’liament to so
amend the immigration law as to allow of the
importation of white British subjects under con-
tract, provided they are not introduced to take
the place of men c* strike, is a thoroughly good
one, if only for the reason that it draws the color
line clearly and definitely. It was Joseph Cham-
berlain and the Salisbury Government which
forced on Australia the hypocrisy of pretending
that it has no objection at all to colored immi-
grants because of their color, and started that
complicated machinery of education tests and
other dodges by which we have to pretend to
either keep out whites, blacks, yellows, and
browns all alike, or to let them in all alike.
Britain holds, in practice, that the colored men
who form the bulk of the empire are degraded and
accursed —unfit for local self-government, unfit to
have any voice in the affairs of the empire, unfit for
any high military positions, and when they take
to the profession of arms only worth a fraction of
the pay of the British Tommy. The inspection
of the back of our Kaffir brother who works in the
Transvaal mines under direct British rule is suffi-
cient to show whether there is any practical
equality between the white and colored British
subject. But despite all this the British Govern-
ment assured us, with tears running down its
nose, that Britain drew no color distinctions,
and could allow of none—at least openly.
For two or three years we have struggled to keep
Australia white while professing to live up to this
British lie and this J. Bull hypocrisy, and it has
been a wearing business. Now, in one respect at
least, a serious attempt is to be made to draw the
color line openly instead of surreptitiously and
underhandedly. How Britain’s new hyphenated
Ministry will act remains to be seen. If the tears
of snuffle run down its nose also it will at least be
a new nose. Australia was very tired of the old
nose.
«
One of the strongest objections put forward by
some witnesses who were examined by the Vic.
House of Rich Landlords in connection with the
Pure Food Bill, was to clause 26, which provides
that not more than 10 per cent, of lead be allowed
in the solder used on tinned articles of food.
Sundry witnesses had a vicious dig at this clause,
most of them declaring that no harm followed the
use of 50 per cent, lead, and that this percentage
was the custom in both Britain and America.
Also, one witness said that “during the last ten
years the question of lead poisoning in canned
goods is practically obsolete. Modern science
attributes the poisoning to bacteria. What used
to be considered lead poisoning is now found to be
ptomaine poisoning.” Then Dr. Norris, chair-
man of the Board of Health, and father of the
Bill, came along, and these are some of the things
he said:—
This clause ... is the law ... in all communities
where the purity of food has been carefully safeguarded
—in France, Germany, Austria, Belgium and Switzerland,
Lead is a peculiar poison. . . . It is one of the most subtle
poisons that we know of, and it has the horrible quality
that you can take it in infinitesimal doses, any one, or any
dozen of which, would be practically harmless, but these
are stored up for a day of reckoning. ... In some cases
you may never get rid of the effects of it. . . . At the
last medical congress it was stated that many cases of
blindness in one of the States of the Commonwealth had
probably been due to the taking in of minute doses of lead
with drinking water, spread over a long period. ... In
England they make the solder in the old way, and the
disease and death from lead-poisoning are decidedly great.
After this evidence a great silence fell upon the
House ; and, without saying a word, progress was
reported.

Lord Rosebery has assured the people of Eng-
land that he can see no remedy for the awful
increase of pauperism—there were nearly 1,000,000
British paupers at the end of 1904, and the num-
ber has since increased by 63,000. Rosebery has
tried hard to solve the question, and it has fur-
rowed his affluent brow, and harrowed his affluent
heart, and he gives it up. Yet Rosebery can
take a steamer any day from Leith or Hull, and
in a few hours strike a little country which has
practically solved the problem and almost wholly
abolished pauperism. Protection, old age pen-
sions, the subdivision of land among a host of
peasant proprietors, the prohibition of large
estates like Rosebery’s, and the abolition of
people like Rosebery —that is how Denmark did
it, or is doing it. It is wonderful how, all over the
British Isles, great bloated landlords and huge
millionaires and grasping money-makers have
rushed with all their teeth at the problem of the
uneven distribution of wealth, and found it quite
incurable. One might almost think they rushed
at the problem so furiously lest someone else
should get there first and solve it. The
question, as Rosebery sees it, is “Why have
I so much money that there is none left for 1000
of my fellow men ?’’ When his impecunious
fellow-men arrive at the question they find
Rosebery already there, and sitting on it with
the answer hatched out: “It is the inscrutable
will of God.” If the 1000 impecunious fellow
men had arrived first they might have hatched
out the quite different answer : “ It is the infernal
greed of rich landlords like Rosebery” —hence
Rosebery’s velocity. This anxious rush on the
part of great landlords like Rosebery 7 passes as
philanthropy and evidence of a deep interest in
social problems. Ninety-nine per cent, of the
philanthropy of rich landlords like Rosebery
consists of telling the poor, with tears, that nothing
can be done for them.

“ Sinbad the Sailor,” at Sydney Royal—
the only pantomime on the continent this Christ-
mas—is a sufficiently gay and bright production
to justify the Railway Commissioners in running
excursion trains from the other capitals to allow
an inter-State view of it, and Joseph Carruthers’
grievances, and other jocular features of Sydney
life. “Sinbad” doesn’t try to be a play, or an
opera, or anything at all coherent. It’s just a wild
burst of extravagance in costumes, quips, dances,
songs and miscellaneous sundries, following the fun
of the moment with gay irresponsibility. When
a dull moment threatens to supervene a comedian
or two comedians, or several comedians (the cast
is rich in comedians; they’re thick as locusts in
the gum trees), enter and throw living and dead
jokes around with reckless prodigality. When
that resource fails, a whip-up of the music hap-
pens, and everybody in the bill (and the bill is
enormous) rushes on, on pretty legs, and wearing
pretty frocks, and sings. What they sing doesn’t
matter. It’s always something with “tra-la-la”
or “ hally-hi-ti ” in it, and it sounds good, for one
of the great natural products of Australia is chorus-
girl. Any theatrical manager who is willing and able
to pay from 255. to 40s. a week can get hosts of girls
who, with a little training, can sing and dance,
and without any training can look well and
shapely. The Anderson pantomime is a gay
success, true to the dictionary meaning of
pantomime, and true to the Christmas require-
ment of something you can look upon while
digesting the unreasonable plum-pudding that
looks like a boiled cannon-ball put on a plate
amid slush.
» * * *
To accurately assign the credit for the suc-
cess of “Sinbad” is somewhat difficult. But
the first fact that stands out is that the
management has not been at all mean. The
stage is simply crowded with gay folk in dresses
that are charming; and if the scenery is wooden,
there is at any rate lots of it; and the mechanical
effects which go so far to make up stage illusion
are excellent. Further, the “book” is bright;
the well-known W. T. Goodge has localised it for
Australian consumption, and his quips and jokes
make much for merriment. A feature of the
book, by the way, is an absence of the anti-
Australian gibes that are so often thought the
best amusement for Australian audiences; where
political allusions are made they are Australian and
patriotic, and one of the most cheered sentiments
is a declaration that Australia will send no more
contingents to fight for Chinese labor. The cast
is so extensive as to read like a telephone directory.
Heading it is Miss Marie Campbell, an imported
principal boy, who scores by her vivacious acting
and dancing. She is a fine-looking girl and lacks
only a stronger voice to make her an ideal actress
for the part. Misses Maud Thornton, Celia Mavis
and Edith Maitland are among the bevy of charm-
ing fairies, harem ladies, and so on, who brighten
the stage, and the very strong team of comedians
is headed by Harry Quealy and Bert Bailey, and
includes George Dean, Tod Calloway, Ralph Bick-
nell and Walter Rivers. Added to all this there are
“ specialities ” by the Bicknells, the Power Bros.,
Lennon, Hyman and Lennon and Miss Elizabeth
Parkes. “ Sinbad ” has, indeed, many ingredients,
and they all blend well to make a merry show.

Owing to the cussedness of the calendar in
coming into conflict with The Bulletin’s publish-
ing arrangements, the few well-chosen remarks
which this paper proposed to make concerning
“The Girl from Kay’s” and the new Hoggen-
heimer are postponed until next year. The first
performance was fixed for Tuesday night; and
Tuesday night is a season of holy awe in The
Bulletin office, when no girl is permitted to come
between the staff and its service. It is the hour
of the weekly sacrifice —a season when, the whole
staff having sat upon seven columns, and tried in
vain to squeeze them into four, and upon seventy
pages, and tried to squeeze them into forty, the
editor puts on his robes of office, and,
bearing aloft a blue pencil, proceeds to
the sacrificial altar, filling the air with
the incense of a stumpy cheroot, and
offers up sacrifices to the God of Inexorable
Space. Then the pet children of a hundred
brains fall with a blue thud—some to disappear
for ever, some to await resurrection later on. This
year Boxing Day knew no better than to fall
upon the day of sacrifice ; and so “ The Girl from
Kay’s ” must wait. Meantime The Bulletin
notices from the advertisement that so many new
featureshave been introduced that she is practically
a new girl; while there will be no end of curiosity
to see how Lauri’s Hoggy compares with
Huntley’s.

night. The audience was most pleasantly sur-
prised by the change of phrase. A week
ago the press and the spoken word inti-
mated that it was “ Good-bye for ever ;
good-bye, good-bye.” In her last words,
Miss Stewart said she would not use the phrase
of finality, but only ciu rcvoir. And she said it
amid applause and presentations of flowers and
cages of birds. The Criterion will now harbor
“ Two Little Vagabonds ” and Holloway’s co. for
a season. Further remarks about the “ Vaga-
bonds ” will ensue next week.

The Great Thurston, under Edwin Geach,
made a glittering resurrection at Sydney Palace on
Saturday night. Among several tricks not tricked
by him on his last visit was “Chinese Magic.”
Thurston would have almost certainly been
hanged, if nothing worse happened to him, had he
lived 400 years ago, the charge being one of undue
acquaintance with Old Scratch. Another new
“ draw ” is the series of animated pictures shown
by the Edisonograph. (When will there be an
end to the series of new ’graphs ? Things have
got to a point at which the Smithgraph and the
Johnsongraph may happen any day.) A long
string of matinees is stretched to suit children
and those grown-ups who go to bed early to save
gas.

“The Gaiety Girl,” which is a whirly-
whirly confusion of inane-looking guardsmen,
colored parasols and bathing gowns, was revived
in all its pre-historic frivolity by The Players, at
Sydney Palace, on Wednesday and two following
nights. The initial performance was a little
rocky and marked by frequent breaks in the
dialogue. These rather got on to the nerves of
the audience, which began to thifik it was attend-
ing an impromptu performance and that the ideas
of the characters were running out. Apart from
that the show went along brightly. Unqualified
approval may be given to Mrs. Phillip Lytton
for her Lady Virginia. She acted and dressed
the part charmingly and sang with ease.
Miss Jean Maclurcan, who also is artistic to a
high degree, pleased the house with her Pose
Brierley. Her voice is, sweet and true; the pity
is that there isn’t a little more of it. Mr. P. B.
Orchard’s Dr. Brierley also deserved a word of
praise for various reasons, one being that Mr. 0.
generally remembered his lines. Some dances
were effectively introduced by Miss Ethel
Phillips, and the sextet and dance, “Are
there any more at home like you?” was
performed by a dozen mere babies, the
sexes equally divided—girls in pink rosebud
frocks and skull caps, and boys in white sailor
suits. The tiny, tots went through the evolutions
of the dance as coquettishly and correctly as their
“Elorodora” prototypes and delighted the audience
with their infantile graces and lisping notes. It
was a pretty picture, but the wisdom of keeping
infancy out of its little cot for such a purpose may
be questioned. The play was excellently mounted,
and the dresses of the society ladies and Gaiety
girls were strikingly smart. In the last act all
appeared in bathing costumes of every color and
of every make. The girls that did look nice in
the scanty garments looked very, very nice, and
those that did not, looked horrid.

The most striking thing about the Tivoli
holiday bill was the announcement, in French, that
eight pairs of jambes would wave nightly until
further notice. The jambes wore green stockings.
The eight “English Primroses” who own them,
after singing something in short red frocks about
the danger of wandering away from mother, lie on
their little shoulders, and wave their green-
stockinged jambes in the air. They wear them
green presumably to represent the primrose
stalks ; but though they might, some of them, be
better, they aren't reallv so spindly as that, any
of them. ” The effect" is certainly novel and
a bit weird; eight “primroses” lying on
their shoulders, and waving eight pairs of
jambes in harmony. It takes, perhaps, more
than one visit to quite grasp the inwardness of
this aerial dance ; next time writer tries it he pro-
poses to also stand on his head and view the pro-
ceedings that way to see if altering the point of
view will simplify matters. But the holiday
crowd likes it, and seems to appreciate it, even
when it doesn’t stand on its head —probably
because it sees more of the jambes when the lady
who waves them is upended than when she dances
the ordinary end up. This, arid A. G. Spry 7, Bov
Glen, the two Bells, dainty Olive Lenton, and
a good all-round bill (though not such a varied bi
as some of recent days) pack the Rickards hous
nightly.

in the multitude of murderers there is no safety.

Nevertheless virtue triumphs at the finish.
The last surviving murderer, having been baulked
in a casual attempt to kill an innocent cheeild
commits suicide by drowning himself off the coast
of Cremorne Picnic G-ardens, and this is such an
appetising event that a number of juvenile pic-
nickers sit down to dinner and sing “grace ’ as
the curtain falls. The kiddies impart a Christmas
Annual flavor to the last act, and make amends in
a great measure for the grief and woe of the
earlier scenes. Walter Baker and Miss Ross woe
considerably, and the Rev. Max Maxwell pawns
his watch to buy luxuries for their sick off-
spring, who is seemingly suffering from a ruddy
complexion. In the midst of these sorrows there
is comic relief, of course. The comic relief,
which radiates from the coffee shop of Bland and
Mrs. Holt, might be judiciously curtailed in one or
two places. Albert Norman and Styan are the
murderers, Brown appears as Andy Badun, an
assistant burglar, and the naughty girls from
Snowy River are Harrie Ireland and Jennie
Pollock. “The Path of Thorns” contains suf-
ficient incident to carry it a long way towards the
end of Bland’s long season. Sometime m March
he will beat his annual retreat from the Royal,
and then Meynell and Gunn will have the theatre
for four weeks (ere Anderson arrives) for the pro-
duction of “The Fatal Wedding.”

At Melbourne Princess’s the Gilbert and
Sullivan opera co. started a series of revivals on
Saturday night with a partly-excellent perform-
ance of “ Pinafore.” The word “ excellent ”is
not too large to apply to the chorus-singing or the
orchestral work of the present combination. It is
the full strength of the co. that counts for much,
whereas the individual efforts of some of the prin-
cipals are worse than weak. Frank Wilson hasn t
the necessary age, weight, or sense of humor for
the part of Captain Corcoran ; there is very little
of Sir Joseph Porter—-a dry, matter-of-fact, com-
mercial First Lord—about Howard Vernon, nor
any suggestion of Gilbert’s Little Buttercup
in the performance of Miss Ghilom, who
doesn’t even look elderly and ponderous. On the
other hand, Kenningham, as Rackstraw, is a
compensating circumstance, and Miss De Loitte,
taking the place of Dolly Castles on Saturday,
makes a very satisfactory J oseplnne. And a heavier
Dick Deadeye than Ernest Fitts could be forgiven
for the sake of the chorus. “Princess Ida is
expected to follow “ Pinafore ’’—for the first time
in Melbourne these ever so many years.

At the Opera House the feats of Lotto,
Lilo and Otto have restored the faded glories of
trick cycling, as far as Melbourne is concerned.
The lady member of the trio is merely a clever
expert, but the two men are rema-rko/ble
performers, and the climax to their game of
bike-ball is a capital piece of comedy on
wheels. The Jackson Family has come back
to raise the musical standard of Rickards s
show for a farewell fortnight or two ; also, the
whited Milo and Cruickshank are there again for
a brief period, and Ada Cerito—most vimful of
serio-comics—continues to give a bewildering
intoned recitation re the young couple who got
married to-day and have fallen victims to cigar-
ettes and mutual infidelity five years afterwards.
Past, Present, and Future get strangely mixed m
Ada’s heated statement.
** * *
Many other Melbourne shows came to
light for the first time on Tuesday, when this
paper was going to press. They were duly an-
nounced in last issue of The Bulletin, and in
next issue they will get all the credit they deserve
for having taken place.

The dull times at Adelaide Tivoli were
brightened by two sets of capable amateurs, who
put up “Jedbury Junior,” by the author of
“Mice and Men” (first time in Australia, by
special arrangement with George Musgrove), and
Esmond’s riverside comedy “ One Summer’s
Day.” Now Rickards has taken possession of his
own house again with “ Urbanora,” which is yet
another name for the Moving Picture. Darrell
has opened at the Royal with “The Sunny
South” (“Thunderbolt” to follow) and Wirth’s
Circus, besides the usual sensations, introduces
“looping the loop” for the first time in Adelaide.
Also the Exhibition rink occasionally helps to
keep things rolling, but the real-ice affair which
would be really popular this weather, has gone
into dissolution.

Horseman Skuthorpe has been gathering in
many shekels at Brisbane with his “Boys from
the Bush.” For over a week his smallest audience
was 1500, while at times it ran to over 2000. On
the opening night a great crowd sat in the pelting
rain and complacently watched the horses, Jersey
cows and poley bullocks upsetting riders on to the
slushy tan. The show, with its 100 horses and its
troupe of stockmen, will work the other States,
and afterwards riot through the Cold Country.

Beauteous Miss Gladys Ure, who took her
musical talent to America a year or two ago,
writes very hopefully of her prospects. She has
refused more than one offer to play the prima-
donna part with an opera co. on tour, preferring
to stay in New York and take engagements as a
pianist and accompanist what time she is getting
known as a composer of songs and waltzes. All
the “ best ” people in the local musical world seem
to have met the brilliant young Gladys, and,
according to news from outside sources, they are all
impressed by her cleverness, and expect her to
make a success with her latest compositions. Un-
doubtedly she has an exceptional talent for playing
piano accompaniments. An artist to the finger-
tips, she is always in sympathy with the vocalist,
and on the platform she presents the uncommon
effect of a lovely girl who is thinking only of her
work. A musician, a sweet singer, a delightful
talker, and a “perfect dream ” in appearance, the
ex-Melbourne damsel needs only good health to
make her a Personage in the near future.
Admirers on this side will be glad to hear that
she speaks of herself as “ feeling fine and strong.”
JOSEPH HAGAN, GENTLEMAN—JACK
O’BRIEN, BRUISER.
The news that Robert Fitzsimmons, the
“ Freckled Freak,” had been knocked out; in the 14th
round of his fight with “ Jack O’Brien ” at San Francisco,
brings a curious personality within measurable distance
of the world’s championship. “Jack O’Brien” is the
bruising name of Joseph Hagan, Esq., conveyancer,
barrister, and man of fashion, of Philadelphia. In fact,
he has been written of by people who claim to be compe-
tent to judge as the best-dressed man on the American
continent. His clothes are wonderful and beautiful, and
so numerous that, when he travels, his trunks occupy a
special freight car to themselves. He usually wears four
or five suits every day, each one more lovely than the
one which preceded it. Like most dudes he is
a crafty, “ all-in ” fighter, and in arranging a match he
drives a bargain that has been known to make a Jew pug
manager blush for very shame. In his own city he belongs
to the best clubs, and goes among the best people, and is a
recognised authority on ladies’ dress and other articles
of vertu. In the ring he is quick as lightning, a tremen-
dous hitter, and altogether, as his picture on this page
shows him, a fine lump of a man. He is only in his 28th
year, weighs 1681 b., stands sft. lOJin., has a reach of
73jin., 14in. biceps, 12in. forearm, and his chest measure-
ments (normal and expanded) are 39 and 43 inches respec-
tively. His beautiful symmetrical waist is only 31in., and
the draping of frock-coats around it to the satisfaction of
Joseph Hagan, Esq., barrister-at-law and professional
bruiser, has driven the best tailors of a great nation
well-nigh dotty.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Gladys Ure, soon after her arrival in New York,
received a letter (written in pencil) from an unknown
adorer who had seen her portrait in a San Francisco
paper and was struck on it. He wrote from Texas,
coming straight to the point at the end of his address :
“If y'ou think you would like to correspond with me
answer soon. I am very young, about 6ft. tall, grey
eyes, dark hair, weigh 1401 b., age 19 years old. I will
close for the time, hoping to hear from you soon, with
love and kisses from me. Answer soon.” They seem to
rush things in Texas. Probably they have learned
velocity while dodging irascible steers.
Jay’s big London softgoods shop, the original of the
“Kay’s” that the “Girl” comes from in the play just
revived in Sydney, has a reputation for securing
damsels of exceptional beauty' of face and figure to show
off gowns and hats. Ugly countesses and millionairesses
buy the goods in the illusive hope that, once inside them,
they will look as well as the handsome show-girls. Several
of the Jay belles, realising that little more than effective
posing is needed in some modern English plays, have
found their way into fairly prominent positions on the
London stage. And a lady who had a leading part in a
recent notable Australian lawsuit was a Girl from Jay’s.
Emmie Owen, who was a leading member of the com-
pany brought from London to support Nellie Stewart on
her return to Australia with “ The Scarlet Feather ” four
or five years ago, died recently in England, aged 33. Miss
Owen had good parts in the original production in London
of “ Utopia Limited,” and in other of the late Gilbert and
Sullivan productions. Her health had been indifferent
for years, and her voyage to Australia was undertaken
partly for that reason.
A prominent amateur elocutionist in Adelaide, young
and not ill-looking, holds the record for the sacrifice of
good looks in the interests of art. Like a good many
others who do not advertise the fact, she has had “ a
fresh deal” in the matter of teeth. On the occasion of a
recital in character (provided the character is aged), she
leaves the “ plate ” at home, and duly appears before a
familiar audience as an old woman (or on occasion an old
man), absolutely toothless. The effect is realistic but
gummy'.
A collection of Ibsen’s letters, treating freely of his
dramatic work, has just been published in London. The
gentle publisher asserts that the book contains “an
abundance of ready humor and much caustic and whim-
sical comment on the march, of men and events in
Europe,” together with “an almost passionate desire to
be understood.” With this coming soon after the an-
nouncement that the aged dramatist’s flame was flick-
ering very feebly, one suspects the publisher of an
almost passionate desire to rush the book out at the
time when the dramatist’s death would passionately rush
the sale.
Hilaire Belloc remarks that in real life “L’Aiglon’s”
mother, Marie Louise, was a shining exemplar of
perpetual tawdry commonplace, and “ the sort of ‘ low-
ness’ which seems fatally attached to monarchy.”
“0.K.”: Beerbohm Tree’s revival of Ibsen’s narrow-
minded sermon, “The Enemy of the People,” called some
attention to the “Master’s” method of sacrificing reason-
able suppositions in order to point his moral. In “The
Enemy of the People ” the civic authorities of a small
town which depends largely on visitors for its prosperity,
conspire to hush up a discovery that the local water
supply is being polluted by sewage or open drainage, or
something. The policy of “ hush ” is quite natural,
seeing that the hushers are prepared to stand the risk of
their own water supply. Their unnaturalness lies solely
in the fact that they don’t promptly propose to remedy the
flaw in the sewage arrangements. They act like a
community of reckless fools, so that Ibsen may sermonise
upon the ancient truth of human selfishness and greed.
All of them (bar the self-asserting hero of the play) are
for keeping the matter dark, and none of them is for
taking practical measures to rectify the evil. If Ibsen
had been living in England at the time of the Oscar Wilde
scandal he might have found a congenial subject
for a play of scathing satire, built on absolutely honest
lines. A_ considerable section of London “society” for
years maintained a conspiracy of siience re the suspected
influence of Wilde, and the one man—the Marquis of-
Queensbeny—who brought him to account was frowned
upon for doing’ an unpleasant service to the State.
Queensberry was treated as an Enemy of the People for
proclaiming a hideous truth which his acquaintances had
preferred to ignore.
“H.” : Andrew Mack’s Tom Moore draws attention
indirectly to Mrs. Fitzherbert. A new biography of her
has value through the use of documents withheld from
all former writers. She deposited the proofs of her
marriage with George IV. in the hands of Coutts, the
bankers. Through various scruples these have never
been available until Edward VII. recently authorised
their use. There is the certificate of marriage in 1755.
The Prince of Wales (George IV.) drew this up himself.
Mrs. Fitzherbert afterwards cut off and destroyed the
names of the witnesses, at their urgent entreaty, under
fear of prosecution. The marriage was by a young
Church of England clergyman named Burt. He received
£5OO, and was appointed to a fat living. In 1787 Fox gave
the Prince’s word of honor —his beautiful word of honor —
to the House of Commons that there had been no marriage.
Mrs. Fitzherbert had been twice a widow, though only 27.
Fox’s denial was when the Prince tried to get a vote to
pay his debts. In 1794 George fell under Lady Jersey’s
influence. In 1795 he married Queen Caroline. About a
year afterwards he went to live again with Mrs. Fitz-
herbert—his wife. In 1799, in a paper under his own
hand, now produced, the royal bigamist declared that she
was his only true and lawful wife. After this he gave her
up for Ladies Hertford and Conyngham. In 1812 he
finally parted from Mrs. Fitzherbert. Nearly all the
family of George 111. were friendly with her, and evi-
dently the marriage was well-enough known to them.
William IV. wanted to make her a duchess, and insisted
on her servants wearing the royal livery.
“L.”: Re “ O.K.’s ” doubts as to Ellen Terry having
been billed as “ Nellie ” early in her career (B. 23/11/’O5).
The statement that such was the case has more than once
been made by persons who seemed to know, notably in a
Cassell’s Magazine article (July, 1903), by Sydney Dark,
who appears to have had access to bills of the time. As
“ 0.K.” implies, Ellen Terry was “ little more than a
child actress ” when she retired to marry painter G. F.
Watts, but from the age of 14 (more than two years before
that event) she had been playing grown-up parts, ranging
from burlesque to Sbauspeare, with J. H. Chute’s stock
co. at Bristol and Bath, and had also taken prominent
parts at London Haymarket (March, 1863, to Jan., 1864)
in Shakspeare, 18th century comedy, and in modern
plays. “ 0.K.” overlooks the fact that Miss Terry re-
turned to the stage after her marriage for a season at the
New Queen’s Theatre, London, in 1867 —seven years before
she was engaged by Mrs. John Wood. It was during the
1867 season that she first appeared with Irving—the pair
taking the name-parts in aversion of “ The Taming of
the Shrew ” called “ Katherine and Petruchio.”
Mme. Melba is credited in the Brooklyn Eagle with
having informed its Paris correspondent that she desires
her son, Mr. Armstrong, who is now 19 years old, to
become an English gentleman farmer, to marry young,
and to have a large family. “An English gentleman
farmer ! ” Are not farmers as likely to be gentlemen as,
say, parsons? “And to have a large family 1 ” How is
she going to arrange about that ?
Mrs. Walter Baker, who played a minor part in the
Hervey-Baker comedy, objects—according to a letterpro-
fessing to come from her —to some of The Bulletin’s
criticisms of the piece. She isn’t, it seems, brown-haired
and grey-eyed. “ I have dreamy blue eyes with drooping
lashes. Which accounts for the actor and the poet; and
I am not plump—as my up-to-date corsets are 18 inches.
And I would not plead guilty to wearing a large green
hat for all the gold in China. I wore a small black hat,
relieved by a large pink rose.” . The Bulletin very gladly
makes these corrections, and apologises for its mistake
about the grey eyes, and withdraws the green hat
unreservedly.
Not long ago Mrs. Kendal —Madge Robertson, sister of
Tom Robertson, the playwright, author of “Caste,”
“ David Garrick,” &c.—reached her 57th birthday, and
doesn’t care who knows, it. As she says, “ I was grown-
up at ten, and began to grow young at forty.” This year
is practically her jubilee, for though as a baby of four she
was led on the boards of the old Marylebone Theatre as
the blind child in Wallack’sproduction of “ The Stranger,”
it was not until 1855, at Bristol Theatre, that she
definitely entered the “ purfesh,” playing Eva in “ Uncle
Tom’s Cabin.”
“ Mr. Bent, who is a whole company' in himself, then
entertained the guests,” says a Melbourne paper, describ-
ing its Premier’s efforts at a mutual improvement
society’s corroboree. Tommy' may not be a whole com-
pany in himself, but he certainly has a remarkable
capacity for making a show of himself.
Manager J. C. Williamson has bought the Australian
rights of Courtneidge’s production, “The Blue Moon,”
wherein Carrie Moore made her big London hit. The
lively Carrie, by the way', dropped out of the cast a few'
weeks ago, but the reason for her disappearance was not
stated..
All the previous boy violinists are said to be far sur-
passed by' Mischa Elman, a 13-year-old who plays the
Beethoven and Mendelssohn concertos with wonderful
feeling as well as skill. As a popular attraction in Aus-
tralia boy Elman would probably be worth more than the
great Kubelik, who now' talks of starting an Australian
tour next August.
Bert Levy, who was a young Australian artist when'he
supplied The Bulletin with an occasional study from
Jew-life, is now appearing at a Boston Hall as a young-
English artist. Levy has devised a sketch called “The
Artist and his Model,” in which he does some black-and-
white work, the lines being magnified, seemingly, after
the idea introduced by' “ Cruikshank ” in the Milo and
Cruikshank turn at Rickards’s.
“ Adelaide ” : The comedy of “ Jedbury Junior,” by
Madeline Lueette Ryley, author of “Mice and Men,”
making its first Australian appearance at Adelaide Tivoli,
proves to be curiously old-fashioned in tone : stern father,
spendthrift son, faithful old servant, exile to “ our
Bombay house,” and so on. The chief item iri the plot
took place in the past—J. Junior’s past. Being casually
on shipboard, he entered the w'rong cabin in the dark,
slept virtuously in the top berth, woke up to find a lady
in the low'er one, bolted out into the arms of her father,
was forced to marry' her without seeing her face, and
then vvas told to clear out. Now his father wishes him
to marry a girl, and he cannot comply, though he w'ants
to. (Same" girl, of course, name somehow altered.)
Identification is only reached after four acts, built up
mostly of Robertsonian cup-and-saucer incidents. There
is not a part which Nellie Stew'art could be imagined as
playing, which is probably the reason why Musgrove’s
co. never staged it, though the casting once got as far as
to allot the two Jedburies to Harcourt Beatty and Albert
Gran. The amateur co. to which George Musgrove
leased it in Adelaide, for charitable purposes, gave a
capable rendering of its quiet humors. The leading
“ juvenile,” Von Treuer, would do well on the profes-
sional stage, and his wife is not far behind him in comedy
talent.
Before Irving had come into existence London Lyceum
was a favorite haunt of the “Screech at the Shutter ”
type of drama that still flourishes. Within a short period
audiences were regaled with “Tjae Death Fetch,” “The
Unearthly Bride,” “A Fathers Crime,” “The Dice of
Death,” “The Bottle Imp,” and “The Vampire.” For
“ The Vampire,” by J. R. Planch6, the vampire trap was
invented, and T. P. Cooke’s disappearance through it, as
the Vampire of the piece, caused a great sensation. In
this jaded age vampire traps are altogether inadequate as
sensation-raisers. Modern playgoers crave something
like a Rontgen-ray view of a land-agent’s conscience, or a
representation of a solicitor scooping the scoop.
“Melb.”: Edward Armes Beaumont, still “Ted” to a
select circle, is the best-preserved man of his age I ever
saw. Like another Ted—Farley—he observed priestly
regimen in the roaring sixties and seventies, Amies
looks scarcely different from what he was 30 years ago,
when he played the swanking Don Caesar de Bazan or
Faust. He was financially wrecked in the boom bust,
with Harwood, Stewart, and all the save-alls, except
Greville, who left £13,000. Harwood and Stewart lost
heart—family men do. Beaumont, who had settled into
doing nothing magnificently, buckled to as a singing
teacher. Now he says: “Ha, ha! best thing ever
happened to me.” Lyster’s brother, not Fred, acci-
dentally shot out one of his eyes.
Alice Crawford, the bright girl from Bendigo (Vic.) who
left Australia with Wilson Barrett’s co. a year or two ago,
has lately been doing well at London Havmarket as Mrs.
Knipp in a curtain-raiser called “A Privy Council.”
Knipp (she seems to have done without a front name) was
about the finest all-round actress of the early Charles II
period. Nell Gwynne was best in merry parts, hut Knipp
shone both in comedy and pathos, and had an excellent
singing voice. She sang some of the songs composed by
diarist Samuel Pepys, and was the cause of trouble
between him and his wife. Giddy old Samuel, who was a
great play-goer, used to send her love-letters signed
“ Dapper Dicky.” He tells how she introduced him to
Nell Gwynne : “ Knipp took us all in and brought us to
Nelly, a most pretty woman, who acted the great part
Ccelia to-day very fine, and did it pretty well. I kissed
her, and so did my wife, and a mighty pretty soul she is.”
Another time: “Met with Knipp, and she took us up
into the tireing-rooms, and to the women’s shift, where
Nell was dressing herself, and was all unready, andis very
pretty—prettier than I thought. . . . But to see how
Nell cursed for having so few people in the pit was
pretty.” With Pepys and imagination more than one
good play could be written round Knipp.
London Manager Edwardes has hit upon the bright
scheme of giving a matinee at which the performers will
consist solely of chorus girls from his various companies.
Aspirants will be free to show their talent in singing,
dancing, or at anything else they think will tickle the
managerial favor. Edwardes was moved thereto by the
recent accidental discovery of a bright star in a 17-year-
old chorus chick, Mabel Green, who went straight from
the leg-ranks to a brilliant success as a leading character.
She was given the show because Edwardes could discover
nobody else who resembled the other leading character,
of whom the second character had to be a counterpart.
“ Thrum ”: In view of the increasing difficulty experi-
enced by the churches in raising the wind, I would
respectfully suggest a means of scraping up the wantful —
something to supplement the bazaars, bun-struggles,
autograph quilts, wheels of fortune, euchre contests,
balls, socials, kicks, raffles, tennis tournaments, athletic
sports, guessing competitions, race-meetings, fee., &c.,
&c., &c. I would suggest that students in holy orders
should, in addition to their theological studies, be thor-
oughly taught the art of slack wire walking, sword, watch,
key and fire swallowing, ventriloquism, sleight-of-hand,
conjuring and the like. The apparent burning of the
curate or the spectacle of a long gust of flame coming out
of the mouth of the archdeacon would save many a
bazaar from failure, and if the bishop could balance a
billiard ball on the end of a cue the takings would be
considerable.
“Hamlet”: “ Yes,” said the advertising agent in one
of the smaller capitals, “advance agents nowadays are a
tough lot. You can’t get a bit of work out of them
unless you pay ’em somethingTo give it to you. An
agent comes to this town with 20 stands, and unless you
give him a shilling or more commission on each stand
he’ll take them across the road to Blank. It’s become a
regular thing nowadays to pay an agent for the work he
puts in your way. It really doesn’t make my profits
any the'less. Now that I know I’ve got to bribe the
agent before I get the work I put it on my quotation,
and so the managers suffer. Some advance men won’t
accept money ; but they don’t refuse a new hand-bag to
take the boodle to the bank, or a watch-chain, or a new
hat, or a score of other things. A married advance agent
told me the other day that he went right through Maori-
land recently, and took his wife with him, and did n’t
have to draw a penny of his salary to pay her hotel board
—he did it all out of commissions.”
“ Hamer” : Re the conventional happy-ever-afterwards
ending required by stage law (B. 6/11/’O5). I once staged
a play that ended logically and unhappily ; and the gods
rose as one devil, and denounced us, and wanted to know
what we were giving them. They thought we were doing
them out of the last act —the one that resurrected the
expired hero, and brought happiness, and matrimony,
and the heavy father’s blessing. Even when we played
“ Gor’ Save ” they wouldn’t go, and our terrified manager
hastily put on the last act of another drama to supply
the happy ending. We tried to make the names fit as we
went along, and accounted as best we could for a super-
fluous burglar and some other excrescences, but the gods
took it very kindly.
“ Skull ” : I was at a local show a short time back, and
a small, smudgy man came over to assist a lady who was
singing a comic song. “Who is he?” I asked. “He
shows some naturalness and native talent.” “ Oh,” I was
told, “he’s nobody—he’s only the limelight man.” More
recently I went to a bigger show, and found occasion to
praise one young man acting a trifling part. “ Pooh,”
said a theatre official, “he’s no actor—he’s the carpenter’s
assistant.”
THE LATE BERNARD BEDE KIERAN,
Champion Swimmer of the World.
The home-coming of the late Bernard Bede
Kieran, champion swimmer of Australia and the world,
was a triumphant procession. All the way from Brisbane,
the land whose prowess he had upheld as a parent of
mighty swimmers showered wreaths on his coffin and
condolences on his mother till, at Redfern, nigh upon
4000 people took off their hats as his coffin was carried
past. Operated upon in Brisbane for appendicitis, he was
reported to be out of danger and progressing remarkably
well. Then, suddenly, a rumor ran round Sydney that
Kieran was dead. Newspaper offices were inundated
with inquiries, and the report contradicted. But it was
prophetic ; on Friday night the people in Sydney saw on
great posters of black and red the news “Kieran sink-
ing,” and that same night, shortly before 11 p.tn., Aus-
tralia’s greatest swimmer died in St. Olair private hos-
pital in the Queensland capital. His body arrived in
Sydney at 12.20 p.m. on Christmas Day, and was taken to
his mother’s home in Burton-street, North Sydney,
whence it went to the Gore Hill cemetery on Tuesday
afternoon.
MY SHOW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ye lovers of the quaint and strange, pray come and see
my show ;
The light is good, the seats select, the charge extremely
low ;
I’ve searched the world for startling things—for freaks
alive and dead,
An’ ’ere’s the bloomin’ lot on view for eighteenpence a
head.
Among the dead are skeletons of birds of long ago,
With names as takes two alphabets to print ’em in a row,
An’ fishes from the ancient deep an’ monsters from the
land —
You’ll see ’em all for eighteenpence, and mounted on a
stand.
I’ve cows with horns upon their backs, an’ sheep with
red-hair tails,
An’ crows whose voices you will take for those of nightin-
gales,
An’ cats in pebble spectacles upon a dog-leg fence—
Gome in an’ look at all of ’em—it’s only eighteenpence.
An’ ’ere I ’ave a artisan—to this fact I will swear—
Who’s idle almost all his time—of clothes he’s nearly bare,
Because his market’s full o’ goods in foreign countries
made —
Gome in—it’s only eighteenpence—an’ ’ear ’im praise
Freetrade.
An’ ’ear me now, I ’ave besides a stranger thing than
these —
A Labor member who believes in Freetrade theories ;
He’s guaranteed as genuine ; his fervor is intense,
Come in an’ ’ear ’im gibber—and it’s only eighteenpence.

The Melbourne Police Commission is still
gathering curious information. The other day a
constable swore that, about two years ago, during
a hotel squabble in Fitzrov, a man shot another
in the back. The constable had seen the bullet
extracted by a local doctor, but the sole out-
come of the uproar was a charge of “dis-
charging firearms in the street,” which was
dismissed. Neither accused, victim, nor con-
stable gave evidence, and nothing appeared
in _ the press about the matter. Also, the
policeman’s report on the case was mysteri-
ously missing. In fact, the only certain evidence
the Commission got was the doctor’s—he had, on
the given date, extracted a bullet from the vic-
tim’s back, said bullet being in such a position
that the man couldn’t possibly have put it there
himself. It was suggested that a good-sized sum
of money had changed hands over the episode,
but no evidence thereof was adduced.

The Adelaide ’Varsity undergrads struck
one bright idea, anyway, in their first procession
foolery, on Commemoration Day. They decked
out a huge pie-stall in good imitation of the awful
horse-trams with which Private Enterprise (Enter-

way of_ cheerful burlesque, they pulled up the
procession every few paces to oil the joints of the

THAT GODLESS SYSTEM OF EDUCATION.
JONES (jocularly): “Would you believe it, this
rapscallion of mine doesn’t even know the
story of Joseph and Potiphar 's wife? ”
MISS SMITHERS (shocked): “Dear, dear me!
It’s quite shameful the way the moral educa-
tion of the young is neglected nowadays.”
Landed interests around Sydney have not
pursued thefts of Christmas Bush this year with
the customary ferocity, and no blood has been
shed over the vegetable. The fashion of regard-
ing the gathering of Christmas Bush as a heinous
crime came to Australian landlords and magis-
trates direct from the May Bush legislation of
England and Ireland. People were whipped as
well as fined for stealing May Bush, and when
transportation to Botany Bay was started several
individuals were sent here for that crime alone.
A type of Australian landlord tried to transplant
this horror and introduce Christmas Bush legisla-
tion.
More local scorn has been earned by the
co. which is supposed to cater for the street traffic
of Adelaide, and does it with lumbering things
that look like bathing machines, drawn by
melancholy wrecks which it calls horses. Some
tune ago another co. was on the point of floating
—jt was to run motor ’buses about the holy city,
-nd it had first-class backing, But the tram
tompany tore around, declaring that it had 1C
motor buses of its own on the way out from
opitzbergem or thereabouts, and this stopped the
flotation. To give color to the thing, one motor
bus actually did arrive ; but apparently it is kept
m its packing-case, because the co. dreads to let
the public compare any other system of street-
locomotion with that by the melancholy horse-
tram. So once more Adelaide is dropped gently
into the soup. And, yet, if such a thing as muni-
cipalising or nationalising the tram system and
electrifying it is mentioned, the usual crowd brays
of confiscation, and vested rights, and robbery ;
and the people who suffer and curse the trams,
vote every time for people who either bray them-
selves, or support those who do the braying.

“ Squidge ” writes :
Mrs. Victorian Governor Talbot and a crowd of sympa-
thetic people have been raising funds for months past to
run a farm colony for epileptics. They have collected a
good many thousands, and propose to set up a fine build-
ing on some land at Broadmeadows, near Melbourne. But
the promoters have made one big initial blunder. They
are reckoning that the epileptics can be made to support
themselves once the colony has been started. This is the
mistake that all people who have never handled such cases
fall into. Epileptics of a serious type cannot be made to
work. The veiy nature of their disease unfits them for
continuous employment of any kind. The big epileptic
colonies in America, Germany and England have never,
in any one case,, been self-supporting. Epileptics
require continual supervision and the most tact-
ful handling in order to benefit them at all. The
a 1 vantage to be gained from their segregation into
colonies are that the breeding of future generations of
similar .sufferers is considerably checked, and that the
misery of the epileptic is greatly lightened. But if there
was any money in him the Collins-street Stock Exchange
push would long ago have tried to float a syndicate to
buy up epileptics and use them for developing the “great
nxtural resources.” The Talbot scheme is going to
fi milder severely into the mud in about six months after
ir, starts unless enough money is raised to endow the
place handsomely. Failing a big endowment, the epi-
leptic colony will become as all the other Victorian
charities —always in debt, always begging, always under-
manned, and always poverty-stricken. The present
collection is a mere drop in the"bucket.

“ E.M.K.” : There is a peculiar kind of
animal stalking Melbourne these nights. It’s in
the shape of a woman, and seems to carry on a
general war with humanity. _ When it sees any-
thing particularly antagonistic to its tastes
it explodes in a hurry. T’other night, it struck a
beautifully-dressed youth, of the dude persuasion.
After walking round him a couple of times, it let
go. “You do look fine, don’t yer? What I
want to know is : Who made yer? God didn’t.
He would be ashamed.” The youth looked up by
way of entering a mild protest. “ Don’t you dare
speak,” said It. “ Who are you to speak to me ?
I tell you the country is damned.” The last I saw
was _ the Thing walking along Flinders-street,
holding a violent argument with Itself; mean-
while the youth clung to a telegraph-post, and
called on the stars to witness that lie was innocent.

Employees of Melbourne Telephone De-
partment appear to be haughty, privileged
persons all
round. A sub-
scriber whose
’phone had got
out of order
tells how he
was reported
for his temer-
ity in address-
ing the man
who was sent
to fix it up.
“I’ve had this
’phone for a
good many
years, and I
suppose I’m
entitled to get
it replaced by
a modern one,”
suggested the
victim, meek-
ly. “Nothing
of the sort, ”
grunted the re-
pairing angel.
“Well, this
machine seems
to be always
going wrong,”
said the sub-
scriber, meek-
er than ever.
“Nothing of
the sort ” was
the reply. “I must be a liar,” mumbled the
apologetic complainant. “So you are,” roared
the master of the situation. Whereupon the
lessee of the antique ’phone, being a rather small
man, unskilled in the arts of war, beat a hasty
retreat from the enemy.
After three years of mortal hard toil and
pounding of the drum of “loyalty,” Brisbane’s
118,000 people panned out £6OO of a proposed
£5900 for a statue to the late Queen Victoria. The
£6OO was shocking enough in itself, but when it is
remembered that £l5O of that amount was the
semi-compulsory contributions of poor school
kiddies, and that adult Brisbane only paid up
£l5O as the result of all that hard cadging, the
result is awful. Having failed to raise enough to
erect a decent statue, Brisbane decided "upon
something to suit its pockets—a sort of breast-
pocket statue, so to speak. When the image was
ordered (an imported article) someone discovered
there was no money for the pedestal. So the
loyal committee rushed to Premier Morgan for
assistance, and Morgan’s Government," being
almost the most embarrassed one on earth at once
promised to sink £6OO in that pedestal.
ENGAGING COOK.
Yes; I think we might manage every night off in the week for you, and perhaps alternate
afternoons; hut I warn you, my husband always insists on one dinner during the week.”
There have been so many yowls about
“Federal Extravagance” and the prospective
cost of a Federal capital, that Prime Minister
Deakin was at last moved to explain that it was
intended to start the capital in a very cheap way,
without any extravagance at all. Whereupon the
S.M. Herald promptly espied another “wrong”
done to the Ma State, and spoke severely in this
fashion
The capital will be a sort of political and administrative
Chatauqua settlement for occupation during the summer
months. And this is the vanishing point to which the
question of the capital and that of the seat of Federal ad-
ministration and government is supposed to reduce itself
if the Deakin Cabinet has its way. That is not the course
to restore harmony between New South Wales and the
Federal authority.
Deakin had better get out of that idea about
economy. For that matter Australia doesn’t
want a dog-kennel capital, nor a hen-coop capita],
nor a boot-trunk capital. It wants a capital to be
proud of, one on which at least two or three
millions have been judiciously spent. Two or
three millions of our own money, that is—not loan
money.

“ Kodak ” attends a political meeting
The other night I went to see the Irrational Woman’s
leg pulled. A whispering flock of about eighty women
sat wedged in a small room with two doors—one opening
on the street and the other on a dark staircase. There
were two men present—both bald. One was the politi-
cian and the other the man hired to introduce him. The
man with the bare head started to talk, and the hairless
statesman sidled to the door opening on the staircase,
and stared up into the gloom, as if he had heard the
Labor party’s hoofs on the roof. Then the impromptu
chairman ran out of remarks and vanished, and the poli-
tician laid a fat reverent hand on his waistcoat and sur-
veyed the assembled gathering through his glasses. It
was the Face at the Window all over again. In the
silence we could hear the secretary’s dog scratching him-
self. From the pub. opposite, a drunk, gurgling happily,
fell out and rolled over to the fence, where he clung.
After a while he discovered the politician with the glass
clamped on to his countenance talking. He crept a bit
nearer and listened. The politician was in the act of
heaving a flabby curse at the Labor party. “ This—er—
party, ladies—l say this —ah—body—this corrupt body ”
• The drunk turned and fled. “ It’s ’n inquest! ”he
muttered savagely. “ I knoo it wuz a dashed inquest! ”
When I absconded, the speaker was telling how many
fangs the Union Label had in its tail ; and a woman near
the door was giving a bosom friend a shining account of
how she trimmed a hat.

The Women’s National League of Victoria,
having held “an exhaustive enquiry,” has arrived
at the conclusions (1) that the charge of sweating
has not been proved ; (2) that women clerks who
are efficient are invariably well paid, but that
there is a scarcity of them ; (3) that the accommo-
dation for women clerks is eminently satisfactory,
with one or two exceptions ; (4) that many women
clerks would be much more suitably employed
pot-walloping or scrubbing (or words to that
effect) ; (5) that a standard of efficiency should be
established. The girl clerk will now please
understand that her case has been considered by
the superior women of Victoria and that she is
mostly a rather poor lot, while her employer is a
perfect angel who treats her better than she
deserves.
The Victorian law is full of all sorts of
kinks and crannies and holes. A week or two ago
three men were arrested at South Melbourne on a
serious charge, and put in the lockup till next
day. They had managed to conceal a penknife,
and, after cutting a hole in the ceiling and
removing the slates, two of the prisoners, who
were small and slim, cleared out, leaving No. 3,
who was big and bulky, to catch a cold from the
draught caused by the hole in the roof. The men
were caught at Kilmore, and locked up there.
They were not searched in the ordinary way. They
were stripped and re-clothed; yet a constable
who happened to pass the cell found them both
out in the passage and on the point of leaving the
lock-up for good. He stopped them with a re-
volver, and they explained that they had pulled
back the bolts with a boot-lace. Various con-
siderations arise—the state of these alleged “lock-
ups ” and the state of the lock-up keepers—but
apart from these, the sublime point is that the
men had committed no offence. The Law in Vic-
toria talks a terrible lot about what it will do to a
prisoner who, “while serving a sentence” in any
gaol, &c., shall escape. These men were not
serving any sentence, and therefore were quite at
liberty to escape if they could. No remanded
prisoner to whom bail is refused need ever stay in
gaol if he can find a means of walking out. So
long as he turns up to take his trial, he has, in the
eyes of the Law, acted quite within his rights.

A further instalment of experiences has
been published by disillusioned Maorilanders,
just returned from Dowie’s city—men and women
who parted with their coin to the saintly indivi-
dual with the frozen forest of hair and the draggled
snowball under his chin. They report, among
other things, that the labor bureau at Zion charges
a stiff fee to people who want work. Instead of
wages the employee receives a coupon for what’s
due to him. The coupons are supposed to be
cashed on demand at the Zion Bank, but one
woman says she was offered five dollars for a
20dol. book. Often Zion doesn’t offer any cash at
all, and as people can’t buy a stamp or a railway
ticket with these coupons (which are not recog-
nised outside Zion), they are practically isolated
from the rest of the world. ’Twas given out that
there was no mortgage on the city, but deluded
people find on arrival that there’s a debt of about
a quarter of a million on it, and those who have
taken up land and are occupying it can’t get the
title dbeds on account of the mortgage. The
“ large Shiloh Tabernacle,” mentioned by Dowie’s
agents, doesn’t exist, but there is a gaol. Six
boys were fined six dols. each, with the alterna-
tive of three weeks, for playing bat and ball in the
street. The parents kicked, and took the matter
to the court in an adjoining town. Then Dowie
grew alarmed and let the kids go. Deaths and
lunacy are frequent; as many as three lunatics- a
week have been sent out of the city. The poor
suffer terribly. There’s no such thing as faith-
healing in the place. Yet so great is the belief of
the folk in Dowie that they think if he didn’t
cure them they would all die at once.

She’ll do as she pleases, and not as she onghter ;
The whole of creation is free to the choice

Some woolly-haired gentleman, frenzied of eye,
Some brown little Monkey accustomed to slaughter,
Some parchment-faced lover who says “ Welly ni’
They’re all on the card for the Senator’s daughter.

A black Lochinvar may come over the water ;
And Senator Dobson, with never a frown,
Will indulgently smile as he mashes his daughter.

“T.D.”: The Italian organ-grinder is
almost a thing of the past in London and other
Hg English centres, but that doesn’t mean that
the street organ itself is vanishing. The Dago’s
place has been taken by British workmen, thou-
sands of whom are this winter engaged in
churning out music instead of having their hands
busy at the forge or elsewhere, building up
Britain’s greatness. Usually, three or four ac-
company the organ in its melancholy round, and
their custom is to chalk across the machine a
solemn statement that they are out of work. The
chalk, supplanting the printed notice of the blind
man or the ineffable Smile of the Dago, would
seem to indicate a hope that worklessness isn’t
permanent. Other out-of-works are going about
in threes and fours and howling a dismal dirge
specially composed for the occasion by some doss-
house Wagner.

“N.”: Last London Times has a signifi-
cant obituary of “Torpedo” Whitehead, who
only died this November. It asks why he received
no decoration from England, while all other
Powers loaded him with honors, and it supplies
the answer : “ Because the torpedo is a misfortune
to England.” The expenditure it has caused is
incalculable, and so are the future developments
of this murderous demon. Just to particularise a
little. The torpedo has caused the enormous recent
outlay on Gibraltar, Dover, and every important
anchorage. Consider the effect on ships and guns.
The Times points out that battleships must now
commence an action out of torpedo range, which
means 4000yds. This makes the gun-layer the
most important man in the navy. Even an
admiral is second to this genius of a bluejacket, as
Beresford has lately been pointing out. Expen-
diture foots up all round in a colossal way. The
torpedo . has begot the submarine. Whitehead
was working for the Austrian navy when an officer
of that nation gave him the crude idea. In 1868
his torpedo was thought to do wonders with a
range of 600yds. and a speed of eight knots an
hour —now it does 36 knots. The torpedo is the
cheap defensive weapon of the country with a
poor navy, and the biggest and most expensive
navy—-which is Britain’s—presents the best target
for it. Therefore, it is a worse misfortune to
Britain than to any other country.

The sale of wives is not even now extinct
in England. Not long since, at Bristol, Selina
Cosh, who was suing Henry Cosh for mainten-
ance, told the quaint story of her married life.
She married Quick when she was 16, and when she
was 17| they separated. A little later Quick sold
her to Bun ter for 7s. 6d., and apparently the
goods allowed itself to be handed over without
remonstrance, as an ordinary matter of business.
She lived with Bunter till he died, and then she
married Cosh, who presently deserted his 7s. 6d.
worth of property. The Bench ordered Cosh to
support the children, and tried vainly to find some
fitting remarks to make about Quick, who corro-
borated everything, and who had long since drunk
the lady—or the proceeds of her.
UNNECESSARY DETAIL.
"Does a short skirt mike a girl look tiller ?”
“ What does it mat’er so long as it male s a man
look longer .”
The little Royal William, a cutter of 43
tons, which wallowed across from Hobart to
Maoriland with the mail some 60 years ago, is
"till afloat and toiling for a humble crust. When
the Union Co.’s turbine steamer Maheno, of
5282 tons, tore her way into the Derwent the
other day, looking like a streak of lightning with
a red funnel, she met her impoverished forefather
plodding into the same port with a load of wood.
“ Lay Brother ” : Our sanctuary, in a
suburb of Melbourne, was gladdened on a recent
Sabbath by the presence of two colored missionary
brethren from New Guinea. There was a visible
sensation when Percival Etaoinshrldu and Marma-
duke Winandaplaceonu (such are our brothers
names) ascended the platform, each clad m nothing
more than a strip of white samite, mystic, wonder-
ful. Brother Buggins, who is a most estimable
and affluent softgoods merchant, assured me it
was the best imported samite. Some pert young
sisters, who had apparently paid clandestine visits
to the playhouse, were distinctly heard to observe
—‘‘Lor’, what boshter legs ! Julius ain’t in it.’
Most of the other sisters, I am glad to say, ex-
pressed their just admiration for the nude
brown limbs in more refined terms. Some
rude boys, who, I have reason to believe,
belong to another sect (I say no more) called
repeatedly for such profane anthems as “The
Lackawanna Coon” and “The Old Pull and
Push.” I understand that the latter song actually
has reference to the swing doors of a public house !
The same benighted youths went on to ask our
colored visitors “What do you shine yourself
with ? ” They also observed “ Oh, what trilbies ! ”
and made disparaging references to Marmaduke’s
beautifully frizzed hair. At this point our aged
Sister Dewlap smote the chief offenders with her
brolly, and continued to do so until they were glad
to beat a retreat. After Percival had tried to hide
behind Marmaduke’s coiffure, besides showing
other signs of a natural diffidence, the pair were
induced to render in their native tongue the Rev.
Augustus Montague Toplady’s sweet hymn,
“Dear me! what do 1 see and hear?” They
also sang “There is a fountain filled with
blood,” and appropriately followed this with
a realistically illustrated dissertation on
the islanders’ methods of warfare. Other
instructive items followed in rapid succession,
until the forward damsels aforementioned were
constrained to remark—“ This is better than
Little Tich,” and “No more Rickards for me
while these are about!” May we not rejoice over
such a result? When our vicar (the Rev.
Zerubbabael Pecksniff) announced after service
that our distinguished visitors would hold a
reception in the vestry, there was a unanimous
rush of sisters to that apartment. Our colored
brethren sold at a moderate price numerous photo-
graphs and autographs, and were overwhelmed
by the sisters with invitations to meals, etc., and
requests to visit our church on future Sabbaths.
Why, you may ask, do I send this item to your
(pardon me for saying so) somewhat worldly
sheet ? Ah, friend Bulletin, do you not see that
a widespread knowledge that the church is pro-
viding such attractions (at a much lower rate,
mark you—a mere plate collection) may coax
many of the worldly-inclined away from those
pernicious haunts yclept playhouses ?

There is still an appalling waste of little
Australians. Sydney got a shock the other day,
just when it was getting ready co eat its Christ-
mas fowl, by reading that of every seven firstborn,
one had a mother who didn’t own a wedding-ring ;
and these little Australians, who haven’t done
anything wrong that they know of, have just about
three times more chances of ceasing to be little
Australians than the other kiddy who hasn’t done
anything to deserve any better treatment. It is a
striking fact that it is when times are hardest
that the fatherless youngster dies in the largest
numbers—very strong proof that he dies
because he hasn’t enough to eat or to
wear. In N.S. Wales between 1899 and 1903,
which, on the whole, weren’t prosperous years, 279
per 1000 of the little Australians whose mothers
wore no wedding ring were snuffed out yearly, on
the average, before they had had their first birth-
day ; last year, when the competition for food and
clothes wasn’t so keen, the rate was only 192 per
1000. In the last five years 4106 of these children
died before they were a year old ; while if they
hadn’t died at any greater rate than the other ones
who don’t deserve any better treatment, there
would have been only 1520 deaths. Which means
that N.3.W. had 2586 immigrants which it might
have kept if it had provided the means to keep
them ; but as it didn’t a kind motherly person
took them, and now they are buried. And the
chances are a good many more are buried that the
Government Statistician doesn’t know anything
about.
In some respects we are a fairly rapid people.
In N.S. Wales last year more children were born
in the first seven months of marriage than in the
tenth, eleventh and twelfth months of-marriage—
2230 as against 2109, to be exact, according to the
Registrar’s figures.
‘ ‘ Adelaide ”: “ Either Australian reverends
are an abominably cantankerous lot, who would
start to break things if one of their own number
were selected for promotion to the vacant S.A.
bishopric, or” (B. 7/12/’5). There is no need
for the “or” ; the first sugges ion fills the bill.
They don’t deny, it themselves. “ Why can’t you
appoint a local man 1 ” I asked an influential par-
son the other day. “Bishop Harmer strongly
advised you to do so before he left. What’s the
matter with , of Westralia, or , of
N.S.W., if you can’t trust anybody on the spot ? ”
“ Nothing at all,” he said, cheerfully ; “but, you
see, a lot of our men came out with Oxford or
Cambridge degrees, and they wouldn t stand any-
body without such a degree being put over their
heads. It works best, in the long run, to get
somebody unknown from a distance.” As it turns
out, the “somebody unknown” is pretty often ; n
unknown nobody.
“Big, heavy, green seas were breaking
over her bows,” said the skipper of one of the big
coastal boats to the reporter of the S.M. Herald
recently as he excused himself and his more than
half Dago crew for running back to Sydney in the
last bit of a blow. And the Herald printed this
and much similar stuff, but didn’t mention the
fact, known all over Darling Harbor at the time,
that a little wooden steamer (the Erina), 37 tons
register, with only Oft. 6in. hold of the water,
built by a young Sydney native, and manned by a
skipper and crew of three, all Australians, left the
Hawkesbury River in the teeth of that storm, and
plugged on through the “big, green seas ” till the
Sydney light was on the stern. Yet they tell us
that the Australian can do nothing on the sea—-
that Australian ships must be for the “square-
head,” and Australian naval defence for some
other man from the other end of the earth.
A few months ago, The Bulletin pub-
lished a drawing of a tired bush larrikin telling
some firemen to play the hose on the slate of a
burning pub. Later on, a variation of the same
drawing appeared in London Punch, in which the
bush larrikin was converted into an Irishman.
Last week, a desperately respectable Melbourne
weekly reproduced the latter drawing giving full
acknowledgment to London Punch for the joke.
It’s wonderful what a coating of respectability is
given to anything—even to a Bulletin joke—by
a trip to the Cold Country.

SILENUS TO A YOUNG SATYR
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OME here, you rogue; put by your pranks,
m 1 and climb
B My knees. Don’t pout ; ’tis surely lesson time.
For I must teach you how Philosophy
Means carelessness and wanton jollity.
Wise are we Satyrs, learning from our birth
All variations on the theme of mirth.
And Old Silenus, spite his bleary eyes,
Knows more of ivisdom than the sbeming ivise.
First, you will tread ripe grapes, with bursting gleam
And bubble, running in pale purple stream.
Huge flagons then you’ll quaff, and nothing lose
Save sorrow, whilst you riot and carouse.
Drunk, you will riot at ease, tasting divine
Indolence, happy with the fumes of wine ;
Then you will be a hunter, keen to snare
Squirrel and deer, white nymph in lilied lair ;
Shy naked forms that through Love’s festival
Glide, hid in grove or tinkling waterfall.
The flute you’ll play, and make mad cymbals’ din,
Leap, wanton, dance, till stars no more can spin.
For you will follow Bacchus ever young
The valleys, hills, and Golden Isles among,
Or goat-hooved, twain-horned Pan, and, when stars
pale,
Pipe to glad goat-herds in some shadowy vale.
Sturdy and joyous ; earth-born, but no smart
Of mortal pain can poison your light heart.
Snub-nosed, maybe, with goat-like ears, and small
Stiff tail, thick, bristly hair—though fools may call
Us ugly, choose some sickly face, yet know
Old bards and painters love us; better so.
For we are Nature’s children ; nay, ’tis we
Pluck off her veil that mortal eyes may see
The Goddess. All the joy of earth—the rush
Of running waters, dawn and evening's hush,
The yelloiv sands, the blue cascading sea,
Wave, cloud, and sunbeam, well and brook and tree,
Bounty of leaves, green glades, wild ivoodland places—
These are but features of our laughing faces.
Young rascal, where’s my horn of wine ? Pin thinking
You’ll all too quickly learn the art of drinking.
Let go my beard, you little wanton, Oh !
You leant to pester Bacchus —off you go.
Head over heels you tumble ; just like that
I used to romp—you perky rogue, too fat!
You laugh ? Not so. As you’re now light and free
So I was once ; and you’ll groiv fat like me.
Bring wine, more wine, Pm dry ; a wise schoolmaster
Likes ready youths ; run fast, you rogue, run faster.

Deducting, therefore, amounts raised for loan renewals,

by the Commonwealth, and advances to settlers loan,
Waddell added £2,252,311 to the debt, while Carruthers
added £1,620,500. Both Treasurers, however, paid off
certain amounts (Waddell paid off most)—chiefly Treasury
bills to cover past deficits. Allowing for these, the net
additions to the debt were

Carruthers (1904-5) .. .. 1,122,142
Waddell, it should be said, was Treasurer for about seven
weeks of 1904-5, but during that period the loan transac-
tions were under the average.

Somebody the other day complained, or rejoiced
(it wasn’t clear which), that Maoriland had no more work
for Seddon to do—that the democratic jug was full. In
that case, Seddon will have time, perhaps, to look into
the mere matter of £s.d., which apparently isn’t
reckoned democratic work. It is democratic work, it
seems, to provide means (as Seddon has just done)
whereby the workman may possibly escape paying the
local landlord an unreasonably large slice of his wages as
rent ; but it isn’t democratic work, it seems, to prevent
the foreign Cohen taking a larger slice as interest. Well,
it doesn’t matter what the thing is called so long as
Seddon attends to it.
Maoriland has for years past been working
something very like a swindle on its people through the
Public Works Fund. Year by year Seddon has professed
to pay large sums out of revenue into that fund, knd the
public has consequently believed that to a great extent
works have been provided out of revenue. But since the
Public Works Fund has been charged with hundreds of
thousands of pounds for undertakings which should have
been paid for out of revenue, the transfer of surplus
revenue to the Works Fund has been largely a fraud.
During last financial year (to March 31st, 1905) no less
than £117,328 was in this way-spent on public buildings
which won’t earn anything, £17,508 on dolling-up tourist
and health resorts, £46,588 on “contingent defence,”
£6482 on immigration, £228,962 on roads, and £14,134 is
debited to “ charges and expenses on issue of land-settle-
ment debentures”; and among a host of other objec-
tionable items are rates on native lands, lighthouses,
charges on raising loans, brokerage and stamp duty 7, and
others which shouldn’t appear in a mostly-loan account
on any pretext whatever. Maoriland’s Public Works
Fund has, in fact, been to a great extent a “blind” for
charging loans with things which ought to have been paid
for out of revenue. It has been a fraud by which the pre-
sent prosperous generation of Maorilanders have passed
the bill on to the baby.
Hence tbe growth of Maoriland’s debt has been
appalling.. On March 31st, 1895, it was £39,635,032 net;
on March 31st, 1905, it had reached £57,403,632, an
increase of over 45 per cent, in 10 years. During the
past four years the following amounts have been spent
out of loan accounts :
1902 .. .. £2,890,767
1903 .. 2,283,198
1904 .. .. 2,715,627
1905 .. .. 2,211,449
Total .. £10,101,041
In that total of £10,101,041 the following items can be
dug out; there are probably just about as many more
objectionable items that can’t be dug out because they
are hidden :
Contingent defence .. .. £269,192
Immigration 6,757
Lighthouses, &c.. '.. .. 42,593
Public Buildings .. .. 675,925
Development of goldfields .. 62,074
Roads. ... ... ... 1,382,827
Tourist resorts .. .. 53,960
Scenery preservation .. 2,090
Charges on raising loans .. 191,813
Almost the worst feature of the case is that the largest
proportionate increases have been in the most objection-
able items. The idea of making the infant pay because his
father didn’t damage the scenery was only achieved last
year. The “ tourist resort’’item is only four years old. The
purely paper item, “Charges on raising loans,” from 1898 to
1901 amounted to £30,00 7 ; for the past three years it has
amounted to £186,193. Taking the w-hole period from 1870
to 1905 the net expenditure on railways from the
Public Works Fund has been £20,804,175, or 51 percent,
of the total. The proportion now being spent on these
works is only 28 per cent. Except a comparatively small
amount spent on land-repurchase, the balance is repre-
sented mostly by things which no self-respecting account-
ant would include in a loan account.
In ordinary circumstances, since Maoriland has
been flourishing in a remarkable way, and the railways
and other sources of State revenue have been doing
excellent business, and the country has not been paying
off any old liabilities, State taxation should have been
greatly reduced. Ten years ago the railways returned
only £2 14s. 6d. per cent, on capital; for the past three
years the average has been £3 7s. 6d. per cent. Other
businesses of the State have shown an even larger im-
provement. But, so far from taxation having been re-
duced, it has become necessary to increase it. Ten years
ago it amounted to £3 7s. Id. per head ; it is now £4 Bs. 2d.
per head, and, as has been shown, the amount must have
been still greater if the loan accounts had not recently
been stuffed with “ scenery preservation ” and similar
items. Within 10 years £1 Is. Id. per head has been
added to the taxes, notwithstanding that the railways,
post offices, and similar businesses are giving better
returns than they did in 1895, arid notwithstand-
ing that the bill for many things which ought
to be paid for to-day is being met with an
IO U payable to-morrow. Loan money is being
poured out on things that give no return, and the people
have to be taxed to pay the interest. And after they
have been taxed ninet.v-and-nine years, tbe lOU that
the State has given to Cohen will be as good as new.
The longer this sort of thing goes on the harder
will it be to do the honest thing in the end. No progres-
sive country can stop public works ; but Maoriland is
piling up such a vast amount of unproductive debt that
the money whicli ought to be available to pay for works
is being swallowed up in paying interest. Its taxation now
amounts to £3,754,379 a year as against £2,300,350
ten years ago. If the debt had not been increased, the
interest bill would have stayed where it was (or
probably, in the event of loan renewals, would have been
reduced), and something' in the neighborhood of
£1,000,000 a year would now be available for public
undertakings. This money would not have carried any
interest, and the profit that came from investing it in
land for settlement, or railways, would have provided
£30,000 a year, by way of a sinking fund, to wipe out the
old debt. Maoriland can’t absolutely undo the foolish-
ness of the past 10 years, but it can stop repeating the
foolishness. At the present rate of progress, in 10 years
time its debt will amount to about £85,000,000, and
another £BlO,OOO will have to be provided in interest,
most of which will have to come out of, taxation. The
question is whether Maoriland is going to raise that
money and build the works with it, and own the works,
or whether it is going to borrow the money, and let Oohen
own the works, and still have to raise the money in order
to pay the interest. It will have to raise the money in
either case ; the question is whether it will raise the
money and own the works, or raise the money and let
somebody else own the works. In the past 20 years alone
Maoriland has paid in interest £33,816,000. If the State
had not borrowed a shilling, it could, with that money
which it has paid to Cohen, have built the whole of its rail-
ways, the whole of its telegraph lines, all its public build-
ings and harbors, bought up all the estates that have been
acquired for closer settlement, and it would still have
had £6,500,000 to provide roads and bridges with. If
it hadn’t borrowed anything at all, without anything extra
in the way of taxation it could have bought and paid for
all its public works, and it would now have the whole of
the £1,915,000 a year, which it has to raise as interest, to
provide other works with. If M.L. needs a stronger argu-
ment than its own experience affords, to induce it to
leave off its present drinking habits, then it must be a
very dull State indeed.
The A.M.P. directors, who are asking permis-
sion to chase business in Britain and elsewhere, have
short memories—or they think policy-holders have.
Their plea is that as an insurance field Australasia isn’t
good enough, and that it is too difficult and costly now
. to get business in the Commonwealth—that new business
can be got at less cost in Great Britain. Yet not 12
months ago they issued a chart to show how much easier
it was to get business in Australasia than in Great Britain,
and how much more progress had been made by the
A.M.P. in Australia than any office had been able to make
in Great Britain. Taking the first dozen British ordinary
life offices on the list in 1871, the A.M.P.’s own chart
showed these things :
Increase (or Decrease) of Funds in 33 Years.

In 33 years the 12 British life offices which were at the
head of the list in 1871 have added £32,065,933 to their
funds; the A.M.P. alone, working in Australasia, has added
£19,602,310, or much more than half of the aggregate
figures of the whole 12. Excluding the Scottish Widows
and the Standard, the A.M.P. has, in fact, added more to
its funds than the whole dozen British offices which
headed the list 33 years ago. And there you have the
best of proofs, out of the A.M.P.’s own mouth, of the
relative value of the two countries as life-insurance fields.
The A.M.P. directors tell the policy-holders
that the cost of getting new business is less in the United
Kingdom than it is in Australasia. They give no figures,
of course. But “ Whitaker’s Almanac ” does—as to
general expense rates, anyway. And here is a list com-
piled from that source, with the A.M.P.’s own figures
added :
Expenses p.c. of Premiums.
Prudential .. ..£8 18 0 Star £l4 16 0
Scottish Widows .. 912 0 Provident . . .. 15 18 0
Scot. Provident ~ 12 0 0 Pelican .. .. 16 16 0
A.M.P 13 11 6 Sun 18 6 0

Life of Scotland ..14,4 0 Standard .. .. 20 12 0
Pearl 14 12 0 Brit. Equitable .. 25 6 0
The Prudential does an enormous industrial business, at
a cost of 40 per cent.-, and this undoubtedly helps the
ordinary business. It is clear from the above list that the
cost of business in Australia is not higher but far lower
than the British average.
Another point as to this matter of expenses.
In Australia a vast amount of business flows automatically
to the A.M.P.. It is just the same in the United King-
dom-only there the business flows automatically to
somebody else. What business the foreign office gets it
has to fight for ; and that means heavy expenses. See,
therefore, what it costs the American and “ Colonial ”
offices which are doing, or trying to do, business in Eng-
land (with the A.M.P.’s rate again added—the rate at
which it can get business in Australasia): —
A.M.P £l3 11 6 Col. Mut.(Aus.).. £26 14 0
New York Life .. 24 12 0 Mutual of N.Y... 28 8 0
Equitable (U.S.). 24 18 0 Sun of Canada .. 29 4 0
Nat. Mut. (Aus.). 25 2 0 Canada Life .. 30 8 0
M.L.A. (Aus.) .. 26 14 0
Thus not one “foreign” office, including the Canadian
and Australian, which is doing business in Great Britain,
shows a lower expense rate than 24 - 6 per cent, of premiums ;
while the A.M.P., confining itself to Australia, can work
at 13’6 per cent. And high expense rates mean low
bonuses.
While the expense rate is higher, the British
interest earnings are lower. The A.M.P. directors say
that “ the practical annihilation of time and space
brought about by improved means of communication has
tended to‘ equalise the rate of interest yielded by, first-
class investments all over the world.” This is mere
liifalutin’. As usual they don’t quote figures; and this
list supplies that deficiency :
Interest Earnings p.c. of Funds.
A.M.P £4 9 0 Scot. Widows ..£3 14 2
Standard.. ..4 111 Royal .. .. 313 9
Scot. Equit. ..4 1 0 U.K. Temp. .. 312 7
Economic .. 318 2 Refuge .. .. 3 8 0
Provident .. 315 0 Equitable (U.K.) 3 7 1
Scot. Provident.. 314 5 [ Prudential .. 36 8
If the A.M.P. issues policies in Britain it must hold
investments there also; and on those investments it
won’t get much more than 3£ per cent, instead of 4£ per
cent. But the British policy-holder, whose premiums are
only earning 3j- per cent., will draw exactly the same
bonuses as the Australian, whose premiums are earning
4J per cent. So the British policy-holder will get more
than he earns, and the Australian policy-holder will get
less.
The splendid bonuses which the A.M.P. has
paid and still pays spring from three sources :—(1) A low
expense rate. (2) High interest earnings. (3) Low death
rate—that is to say, the long life of the insured, which
means that more than the estimated number of premiums
are paid. And as to these
(1) It is shown that no Canadian or other non-
British office which is doing business in Britain is
working at much less than twice the A.M.P.’s
rate; that is, it is costing the A.M.P. only half
as much to do business as it is now costing those offices
which have invaded Britain. The half which the others
spend in expenses, the A.M.P., by sticking to Australasia,
divides in bonuses.
(2) It is shown that, of the two greatest British offices,
one earns 14s. lOd. p.c. less than the A.M.P., and the
other £1 2s. 4d. p.c. less. That extra 14s. lOd. and
£1 2s. 4d., which the A.M.P. earns by confining itself to
Australasia, is divided among the policy-holders in
bonuses.
(3) The annual death rate in England and Wales is 154
per 10,000 ;in Australasia it is only 118 per 10,000. To
share bonuses with a shorter-lived people inevitably
means that those bonuses must be reduced.
For which reasons A.M.P. policy-holders who
want to maintain their bonuses will strike out the “ Yes ”
from the ballot papers which have now been issued to
them.

The Westralian Agricultural Bank, one of
Australia’s four State Land Banks, though some of them
work in hobbles, and a fifth (the Advances to Settlers

a land-bank, even when one feels most affable :

The bank has gone on extending its operations, though
not very rapidly ; if one may judge Westralian settle-
ment by these figures, then its progress hasn’t been so
rapid as the sudden creation of a fine, full-grown cash
market for all sorts of farm produce would have led one
to expect; Westralia has the market, it has the bank to
help settlement, the question is whether it has the avail-
able land. The figures which follow shew the amount of
advances and some other particulars :

A very serious defect in the bank’s report as presented to
Parliament is the absence of a balance-sheet. There is a
profit and loss account, and some other figures are
scattered through the report ; but in the absence of a
balance-sheet one cannot tell whether the alleged profit is
true profit or not—a lot of it may be represented by bad
or doubtful debts in the shape of overdue instalments and
interest. Even the profit and loss account is far less ample
than the figures published by a people’s institution ought
tobe;whileinsomecasesitisimpossibletomakethe figures
in the reports tally. Thus it is said that “ £297,600 has
been paid to borrowers in progress payments.” Twelve
months ago it was reported that “ £215,000 had been paid
to borrowers in progress payments.” This would make
the year’s advances, as shown above, £82,600. Yet in his
report the manager says—“ Taking the year’s operations,
I find that the amount advanced was £85,463.” Dis-
crepancies of this sort would be practically impossible if
the bank issued a plain, straightforward balance-sheet;
it would save a lot of needless vague remarks and present
the situation much more accurately.

The funds consist of assurance fund £4,195,850 and in-
vestment fluctuation reserve (from which £963 has been
written off during the year) £85,672. In point of funds,
as also in point of age, the National Mutual ranks second
among the existing offices of the Commonwealth pit and
the M.L.A. date from 1869, the A.M.P. from 1849. But its
figures have grown most rapidly during the past few
years—to a great extent, no doubt, through a quick exten-
sion of business in S’Africa. Whether the Australian
policy-holders have gained or are likely to gain anything
from this is another matter. Certainly the expense rate,
which was always high, is increasing; and that isn’t a
good sign. The movement is shown hereunder :
Expenses Compared with Total Income.

The A.M.P.’s rate on the same basis last year was £8 16s.
7d. per cent.; on the basis of premium income alone the
A.M.P.’s rate was £l3 6s. 9d. per cent, against the
National Mutual’s £24 6s. lOd. per cent., including among
the income in both cases the consideration received for
annuities granted. As to the cost of new business,
nothing can be said definitely. Every actuary has his
own way of finding it out, and generally his way is the
way that suits his own society best. This can, however,
be said, that whereas in 1898 the National Mutual’s new
premium income was £35,927, and the total expenses
£86,398, or 240'7 per cent, of new premiums, in the past
year the new premium income was £83,543, and the
expenses £138,370, or only 165"6 p.c. of the new premiums.
If we allow 7 p.c. as the cost for renewal premiums, and
charge the balance against new business, this new busi-
ness cost 183 per cent, of the first year’s premiums in
1898 as against 127 per cent, in 1905. This is very sub-
stantial improvement. How much of it is due to Austra-
lian arid how much to S’African business it is, however,
impossible to say. But looking at the proposed A.M.P.
extension in the light of these figures, this has to be re-
membered : that the A.M.P.’s present expense rate is
£l3 6s. 9d. percent., and even if the society could get
S’African business at £l6 2s. 9d. (which is £2 per cent,
below the National Mutual’s average rate), the Australian
policy-holders in th« A.M.P. would still be out of pocket
—it would mean a reduction of bonuses for them. It
would pay the National Mutual well to get foreign business
at £l6 2s. 9d., because that is below its average expense
rate ; it wouldn’t pay the A.M.P.’s policy-holders, because
that is much above their present expense rate.
In the matter of profits and bonuses for policy-
holders, the National Mutual has for many years past
been largely helped by its high interest earnings :

The last line is a blot on the society’s accounts; “ deferred
instalments of annual premiums ” is a paper asset, pure
and simple, which may possibly never be realised ; and
few offices now keep it on their balance-sheet. Loans on
policies are small : and that is a good thing. In some of
the best of Australian insurance accounts this is a sorrow-
ful item ; it includes the absorbed premiums on all those
policies which are kept in force out of surrender value ;
and, though it swells the interest earnings (because the
rate charged for this accommodation is usually 7 p.c.), it
very often means total surrender or lapse of policy in the
end. The high earnings of the National Mutual are
all the more creditable because they are not to a very
great extent swollen in this manner. Of ciburse, with so
small a proportion of public securities, and so large a pro-
portion of mortgages and freeholds, the risk of loss
through depreciation is considerable ; yet the proportion
of foreclosed properties to total assets is comparatively
small. The whole situation under this heading of earn-
ings looks satisfactory ; though a much heavier holding
of public securities would make it look more stable.
The National Mutual has a triennial valuation
and distribution of bonus ; and 1905 was a bonus year.
Valuing on a 3£ per cent, basis, the surplus ascertained
was £261,207, of which £260,000 was divided. The pre-
mium income for three years (exclusive of consideration
for annuities) had been £1,349,912 ; so the bonus repre-
sented 19/3 per cent, of premiums. The A.M.P.’s bonus
on the same basis was last year 35'7 per cent. But, when
comparing those two figures, some allowance must be
made for the fact that, under many tables, the National
Mutual’s premiums are rather lower.

Doing a comparatively small business —so small that the
law of averages hasn’t room to turn in any single year—
the results are naturally erratic ; and for the past year
they have been on the favorable sidei In the matter of
losses, that is ; in the matter of expenses, the rate has
jumped to 32'7 p.c. of net premiums. The co. publishes
so few details that the pen can’t be put upon the par-
ticular cause of this jump. Down to seven years ago
even less detail was given ; since then progress can be
traced in this way

But it is pretty clear that the rapid fall in the loss-rate
shown above is little more than a coincidence ; though it
would show either bad ma n age in e nt-br bad luck (which in
insurance is mostly bad if over a period of
say seven years this co> averaged more than 55 per cent,
of losses. The co. doesn’t separate its agents’ and other
cash balances from its fixed deposits, and what' its invest-
ments are yielding is therefore; hidden ; but on the mean
of its total assets last year’s return was £3 12s. 9d. per
cent. As something over, half its funds are represented
by “ mortgages and accrued interest ” the return looks by
no means too high. But any test of the real value of the
securities (and therefore of the reserves) is worth little or
nothing on account of the unsatisfactory form of the
balance sheet, &c.

The figures are very little changed from those of the
previous term, and no movement of any consequence is
disclosed. The co. owes £7067 on deposits, against £7034 ;
its advances and stock (partly at valuation, partly at
cost) total £21,324, against £21,131; and the profits are
at the rate of £lO 11s. per cent, per annum on capital as
written down and reserves. But very much depends
upon whether enough has been written off stock for moth
and dust and decay ; and that is a question which figures
don’t answer in a hurry.

The formal reserve fund of £lOOO is on fixed deposit; the
balance of reserves, as well as the capital (£20,000), is used
in the business. the co. has kept clear of debt; total
liabilities to the public amount to only £326. As £19,605
is in plant, mains, &c., the writings-off for depreciation,
amounting to only $ per cent, per annum, appear
inadequate ; and sooner or later, when large renewals
have to be carried out, the present policy is likely to land
the co. in difficulties. If £ per cent, per annum does not
cover depreciation, then the alleged reserves are not real
reserves ; indeed, it is possible that the co. hasn’t even
got all its capital intact.

The first line of State motor-’buses in Mel-
bourne—between Malvern and Prahran—began well, the
takings by the five ’buses for the first six days being
£142, leaving a net profit of £35. No doubt, the novelty
raised the takings ; against that, wretched weather kept
them down. The ’buses cover the 2£ mile run in three
penny sections ; and, as analysis showed that this innova-
tion paid, the Tram Co. at once instituted penny sections
on its parallel line in Dan den on g-road. So once more the
public promptly benefits by “ interference with private
enterprise,”
the div.)is now made on the latter. By selling 25,000
new shares recently at a good premium, and by capi-
talising profits in the manner just mentioned, the over-
draft. which stocd at £15,629 three years ago, has-been
wiped out, and a credit balance (before paying dividend)
of £2463 has been established. Heavy additions have also
been made to plant and other assets. The co. runs both
was and electric light undertakings ; gross profits on the
sras business were in the past half-year £5043, and on the
electric light business £12,204. Some of the co.’s assets
are common to both undertakings; making a pro-
portionate distribution of these common assets be-
tween the two undertakings, the gas shows a re-
turn of about 16j per cent, per annum on the capi-
tal invested in it, and the electric light about 26*
per cent. But a somewhat larger amount is written
off for depreciation of the electric light assets. The co.
has been and still continues a remarkably profitable one ;
on the capital and reserves the net profit shows a return
of £2O 13s. 9d. per cent., which is probably almost rich
enough to make the Perth municipality think some large
thoughts. Lighting is a necessity of modern city life;
and the question is : How can private enterprise justify a
net return of Over 20 per cent, made Out of ministering to
a public necessity?

“The agents of the Sulphide Corporation have
received a cable that the annual meeting was held in
London on the 18th inst., and that the report of thedii ectors
was adopted.” That’s all ; and holders of ordinaries felt
their hopes down in their boots again ; they haven t had
a taste since 1900. There are 550,000 pref. shares of £1
each, entitled to 10 per cent., and on top of that £lOO,OOO
of debentures ; and on top of that again an expensive
system of management; further- (which is a good thing in
its way, but mighty rough on ordinaries) the co.
severely writes down plant, &c., out of profits. So, in
spite of a remarkably good mine, ordinaries are kept
starving.

The market closed for Christmas with buyers of
B.H. Block 14 ordinary at 30s. 3d. and sellers of Block 14
pref. at 295. From that one can reckon up how much
the state of the mines has to do with the boom prices.
For Block 14 pref. shares ought to be worth at least 25
per cent, more than ordinaries. They'are entitled to all
divs. that the ordinaries get, and carry a- 10 per cent,
cumulative preference besides, and on liquidation they
have a preference of 6s. per share. Yet ordinaries are
quoted higher. Gambling—pure gambling.

South Blocks have been the Broken Hill work-
ing miner’s fancy' stock—when he has thought it worth
while having a fancy stock —and he holds in the aggre-
gate many' of the shares. The Australian director has
generally seemed to him to be a greedy vulture ; but he
gets a chant® now to see. what the Bull director is by
cauip-irison. Under Australian management the South
Blocks’ directors’ fees averaged about £lOO the lot; now
the management'is shifted to London, and each director
(five at least) gets £2OO, with an extra £lOO for the chair-
man, and 1J per cent, on divided profits in any' year
when 10 per cent is paid on the shares. The Argus says
“it is the first time the London practice of allowing
directors a proportion of the profits has been introduced
into the management of mines at Broken Hill.” Wrong.
The Sulphide Corporation, another English-run Barrier
concern, has made a similar division. Arid who says
Sulphide results have been as good, as those from the
neighboring South, run by an Australian manager and an
Australian board on Australian lines ?

C.S.A. shares (N.S.W.) had an actual sale at
£7 15s. for a parcel of 100 just before Sydney ’Change
went home for the Christmas spell. C.S.A.’s have been
the lucky gamble of the year. Just before Christmas,
1901, half-a-dozen shares iti the syndicate of 44 were being
handed round at £5O apiece ; they are now cut into a
thousand each, so the old share is worth £7750 on the
Sydney closing quotation, or £342,000 for the mine. But
the gambling stage is not finished yet. It has yet 1 to be
proved that the rich ore goes down below the present
level. The doubt is whether the level where work has so
far been done is not a mere narrow zone of secondary
enrichment.

the silver-lead field that can only’get to the world by drag-

or Pie ton. J. V. Bartlett, the old-time “ king ”of the field,
doesn’t scatter information as to what he is doing, and
visitors don’t get a chance to see much at the parent
show ; but at the Silver Peaks (leases 1 and 2), the niostly-
Sydney co. which all the year has been pushing down a
straight shaft to cut Bartlett’s lode, has at 541 ft. struck
what looks like the thing it has been after. Formation is
said to be identical with that in the upper levels in Bart-
lett’s workings, viz., first a vein of very rich sulphides 6in.
thick, then mixed vein matter 4ft. 6in. thick, then the
lido proper, consisting of 2ft. of sulphides, with quartz
b uids intervening. Several samples of the sulphides have
gone from 730 z. to 86oz. silver and from 70 to 72 per cent,
lead ; and though the vein is narrow (say 12in. of stuff of
this value), the stuff is so rich that there is money in it,
in spite of the cruel cost of cartage. And with ore at
541 ft. (say 750 ft. on the underlay), Yarranderie or Burra-
gorang can fairly reckon that it has a permanent vein.

Great Boulder (W.A.) looks as if it may open
up a new rtiine in its long-neglected north block. At
both 800 ft. and 1000 ft. levels the Ivanhoe’s east lode has
been pierced by drill, being 17ft. wide, Worth lljdwt., at
the former level, and 9ft., worth 27dwt., at the latter.
The lease is 600 ft. broad, so Boulder may have a nice run
of ore in this block. If the shoot continues, Boulder
No. 1 may also have a run, but few shoots are so
persistent.
* * * *
Kalgurli (W.A.) is looking rather better. In
sinking the main shaft below 1050 ft. a lode was met at
1080 ft. worth 6dwt. to 9dwt. At 1140 ft. the lode is the
full size of the shaft, and of good value. This discovery
greatly improves the position, though, owing to the ore
occurring in lenses, no one cares to foretell the future.

Amongst many others, 8., M. and Co. tackled the pr -
position and gave it best, and it has b
manager Judd to make a success of a venture that was
condemned and ridiculed by everybody. And the
cutting part of it is that the very smart crowd would
insist that Judd was a johnme who was an expert merelj
at polo. ,
East, Fingall, Day Dawn (W.A.), under same
control as Murchison United, has also been pushing
ahead, and is now opening out at 500 ft, In a winze below
No. 2 level the lode was said to be sft. wide and worth
23dwt., while, in the main shaft at a depth of4l3tt.,it
was cut “Bft. wide and worth 61dwt.” If further develop-
merits confirm these reports, shares should have a sharp
rise. Yet notice that, instead of rising, they fell after
the announcement of all these good thing's. Co. is in
400,000 shares of ss. each, many of which have been
placed during this year.

Murchison Associated, Day Dawn (W.A.),
after fooling about for ten years, recently “got a move
on,” and has cut the lode at 800 ft. The concern is
supposed to be working on the nor’-east branch of the
Fingall lode. To buoy up hopes, the usual yarn about
the Great Fingall being poor near surface and improving
with depth has been trotted out again and again. A
10-head mill is oh the Rubicon lease, once owned by
the Great Fingall, and intermittent crushings from the
shallow ground have panned out very badly. A big spurt
has, however, recently taken place in the scrip, but as no
pay ore is developed, the future of co. is still very
doubtful.

Something like a Christmas cake. The Meeka-
thara State battery (W.A.) the other week put through
from the Revenue for 8690 z. Now a further lot of
ljcwt. has been treated for 2050 z. This brings total from
property up to 24640 z. from 15 tons 6Jcwt. Take some
beating.
* * * *
Some more fancy crushings : —St. George, Lake
Darlot (W.A.), cleaned up 24 tons for 7480 z. ; total from
mine, 64320 z. from 208 tons. The Recovery, 20 Mile
Sandy, in the nor’-west, won 790 z. from three tons;
while the Prince Oscar, Kanowna, the site of the once
famous Fitzroy Lead, has yielded 1730 z. from 14 tons,
bringing up the total since September to 5060 z. from 29
tons. But how- they do have to scrape to get a ton of
this stuff at most of these mines !

Higgins’ Find (W.A.), away out between
Widgiemooltha and Norseman, which is turning out well,
is by some thought to be McCann’s Find of the early
Coolgardie days. It is certainly in the same direction.
McCann, it may be recalled, was within an ace of being
lynched, because he could not re-locate his find, and
diggers thought he had been hoaxing them.
Charters Towers mines turned out for Novem-
ber 19,483 tons for 13,6730 z. ; 21,013 tons of residues
treated by cyanide were worth £14,590. Concentrates
(£18,100), siiver, copper, &c., bring the total value to
£81,199, equal to £4 2s. per ton. Owing to a number of
recent floats, calls are heavy ; 18 co.’s required £8629. This
is what the books show; what the co.’s receive is a different
matter. Dividends totalled £9645. Brilliant Central,
£2500 ; St. George, £3600 ; Phoebe, £3500. For December
Mill’s United is out with a Is. div., Golden Alexandria 6d.„
and New Queen (£7500 in hand) will be heard from.

Half-yearly report of Queen Cross, Charters
Towers, ought to be draped with black. Average value
of stone has had a bad fa 11—10,977 tons for 12,4000 z. j
residues and concentrates bring total value to £49,286,.
equal to £4 9s. per ton. Term before 14,263 tons averaged
£7 Is. The mill was wrecked in October, and that fact
may account for the fall in output, but not for a drop of
£2 12s. per ton in the value of stone. Evidently “the
bank ” is exhausted, as only £20,000 has been paid in.
dividends for the six months, against £62,500 for the pre-
vious term. The straight shaft is going down, and
should bottom in another 500 ft. Total depth when it.
gets there, 1750 ft. The co. has learned the folly of allow-
ing development to get behind, and is vigorously pur-
suing leaders through its top ground. What the straight,
shaft is after is the formation worked by the Band of
Hope ; results there were so poor the co. had to ask share-
holders for more capital. But Marshall's Queen and the New
Queen are on the same thing as the Band, and are getting
good results. Marshall’s got £1544 from 251 tons ; its.
reef will average 16in. New Queen turned out 1113 tons
in a month for £6417, and report says that it can keep,
it up. The Cross has £18,265 in hand ; about £6OOO will
cover the cost of repairs to the mill. The show is in the.
fashionable locality, consequently is just the property 7
that will move if the straight shaft strikes anything.

English directors of the long-slumbering Bonnie.
Dundee, Charters Towers, are taking their gruel in
moderate doses. Bull lost faith in the show, as far as.
contributing shares are concerned, years ago, and allowed
the majority of shares to find their way to Australian
holders. Some time ago a sufficient number of proxies,
went across to shift the office to Charters Towers. But.
Bull was not having any, and blocked the move. When the.
reconstruction scheme arrived, Australian holders refused
to provide capital to carry on unless the office was
shifted. This brought Bull to his senses. The new c 0.,.
if Bull approves, will be in 120,000 shares of 10s. each ;.
application and allotment, 9d. This will bring in £9OOO.
Against this there are liabilities amounting to £BOOO ; so
the new co. will kick off with only £LOOO in hand. Calls
are not to exceed 3d. a month. The Bonnie has three
shafts on a 33-acre lease. Had the money been put into
one, the co. would have proved its ground by now ;
but, as the cash was fooled away, the co. knows
little more of what the lease contains to-day than
it did nine years ago. Locality is worth spending
money on. Some doubts exist, owing to the un-
certain nature of Towers reefs, whether the best-equipped
shaft is deep enough to have cut the correct Brilliant for-
mation. The reef now being worked in the deep ground
by the Brilliant Extended may extend into the Bonnie’s
lease. But it’s hardly likely, as the Extended has it ex-
posed for some 400 ft., and it’s a phenomenal run of stone
that lives even that distance. Even now the reef, in the
eastern levels towards'the Bonnie, is splitting. Local
directors will have three months to watch developments
in the adjoining properties, as it will be that time before,
the co. gets its harness on.
New Queen, Charters Towers, crushed 533 tons
for 4970 z. ; cyanide, 696 tons for £675 ; concentrates,
£573 for two weeks’ run. On the strength of this and
past crushings, a 6d. dividend has been declared, equal to
£4OOO. Show has a record ;it was unproductive for 15
years. Now it is expected that the mine will keep going
and pay occasional divs. while this make of stone lasts.
No quantity of stone is opened up, as the reef is only
16in. New Queens have always been a slippery stock to
play with.

Now that O.K. is opening up all right at lower
levels, the tremendous difficulty in getting stores to the
mine and products away leads already to proposals for
rail or tram connection. Chillagoe Co., which missed
the chance of its life when it turned the O.K. down, is
interested, and would no doubt, bard-up as it is, raise the
money to bridge the 45 miles between O.K. and Mungana.
But O.K. isn’t likely to walk into that parlor. Prom O.K.
to Mungana is certainly only 45 miles ; but if the O.K.
line strikes the Ohillagoe-Cairns line at Biboohra, though
that would mean 85 miles of new line, it would save about.
100 miles of haulage for all time. The line could be built,
under the same Mining Act provision as that under which
Stannary Hills carried through its line —that is, assuming
that the State didn’t feel justified in extending its own.
line from Biboohra on. As this line would pass through
what is believed to be good mineral country, Government,
might do worse, when it has a spare man available, than
consider whether it would be worth while throwing an
extension out that way.

A proposal is made to build smelters at Towns-
ville (N.Q.); reported that somebody representing the
inevitable “English capital” is to visit and report.
Stated that, on an average, from 1200 to 1600 tons of ore
leave port „he monthly for southern smelters. Asa.
matter of fact, 1000 tons per month would at present
easily cover the stuff passing through, but it may be more,
presently. Bulk of it is gold concentrates, and much of
that is already secured to established smelters. With Clon-
curry connected by rail, however, the proposal would be:
worth looking into.

The “ practical-man ” manager thrives on Gym-
pie (Q.). A miner works up to be boss, and if he has enough
influence he gets the management. Which is all right if,
while he works up, he also reads up. But a few visits
underground prove that he generally doesn’t do any-
thing of the sort. The relation of the mine to the battery
is a point which he consequently overlooks. In the
largest mines this is the great trouble. Ore bodies are
either not sufficiently large or not sufficiently developed to.
keep the stampers going. Yet the great idea is that the bat-
teries (which under the conditions are too large) must be
kept going. Result—mullock is sent to the battery. Take
a few returns from No. 2 S. Great Eastern, as an example.
The average per month for six months prior to erection of
the extra 20 head of stampers (there are now 80 head) was
.3886 tons, for 46360 z. Average this year (with SO head) is
5519 tons, for 38550 z. The great difference is partly due
to the falling-off of gold, but the crushing of mullock is.
also largely responsible. The same things happen at
Gympie Scottish. Further proof of the same hand-to-
mouth policy is to be found in the backward state of the
stopes in these mines. And it costs just as much to truck,,
haul, and crush mullock as ore. Also the more mullock
they take out, the bigger and more awkward the stopes.
The Gympie Scottish has been forced to buy billet wood
to stack below so as to raise up the stopes. It is also
sending mullock below. Thus mullock goes both wa}S,
.and costs a lot each time. Cheap working isn’t possible:
under such conditions.
Authority to construct the Etheridge railway
lias been got in Queensland. No Bill was drafted,
but the sanction of both Houses was solicited to an
agreement between the Secretary for Railways and any
person or persons, etc., “for the construction of
a line of railway, commencing at or near Ohiliagoe,
on the Chillagoe Railway,” to a terminal point at
or near Georgetown, on the Etheridge goldfield.
Provisions of the proposed agreement are
briefly: Plans and specifications to be approved by
Railway Commissioner; construction to be similarly
approved ; gauge 3ft. 6in. ; to be constructed within five
years. Deposit of £5OOO to be put up ; Savings Bank
interest allowed on same. If not completed within five
years the £5OOO may be forfeited. Costs of construction
including brokerage and underwriting, not to exceed
£450,000 ; all payments subject to audit by Commissioner.
Commissioner to work and maintain line or any section
with his own staff ; rates and fares not to exceed those
authorised for Chillagoe railway. Cost of management
.and working per train mile must not exceed by more than.
25 per cent, average of last three years on Chillagoe line.
Government to pay contractors per cent, per annum
for 15 years on cost of construction, not exceeding
£450,000, or, until the railway is completed, on the
amounts actually expended. Any profit oyer 2j per cent,
to go to the contractors. At the expiration of 15 years
Government to purchase the line at 28 4-7 times the
average annual net earnings (i.e., excess of receipts over
management, maintenance and working expenses) during
the last preceding five years. Purchase money to be paid
in cash or 4 per cent, inscribed stock at the option of the
State. This means that the State guarantees to work:
the line and return £11,250 per annum to the people who
put up the money (for 15 years at all events). For the same
term the contractors’ liability will probably be more, as it is
unlikely the money will be raised on debentures at less
than 6 per cent. If the line earns under 2J per cent, the
State must inake up that amount. If the line earns 10
per cent, the syndicate takes it all ; the State takes
nothing. The State can only make a loss ; it Cannot
make a profit. At the end Of the term, if the line s
average net earnings for the last five years equal ■>.) per
cent, on cost, the State will have to pay the contractors
the cost of construction. If the line is earning 7 per
■cent., the State will have to pay double the cost
of construction, and so on. On the other hand, how-
ever, if the line is only earning If per cent., the purchase
price will only be half the cost, in which case the con-
tractor will be in the soup, and the State will not be very
much out of it. The Government of the day will have to
raise the purchase price at per cent, or under, or it will
be a loser. To pay in 4 per cent, inscribed stock will
make it a certain loser, unless, of course, after the 15'
years the earnings of the line improve. This, of course,
is not impossible. It is a painful effort to get railways
and dodge the syndicate shark at the ;auie time ; and, at
the best, it only dodges him for 15 years, and meantime
doesn’t dodge him very effectively.

From the same “East Coast Tasmanian” who.
some months ago foretold numerous things that have
happened since, leaving large holes in many pockets .
“ In a recent Bulletin it was remarked that it would be
treason to ask why boring is not being done on Briseis
Extended. Fact is, Briseis Extended was bored all over
years ago to a depth of 90ft., and the results indicated
that ground .Was unpayable, excepting a block near the
road, where present co. is now working*; also a small
patch, near the.river. With these exceptions, the pro-
perty is too poor to pay. When the co. works out the
ground near the road, the show Will fizzle.
“Gladstone Development Co. seems to con-
template floating several ‘pups’ on strength of several
clean-ups of over three tons per week. But I assert that,
so far from the co. having 14 miles of ground of similar
quality to that now being worked, the dredge is on the only
known good patch on the whole property. Co. has seven
or eight months’ work on this first-class block ; balance of
ground is dog-poor in comparison, although there are
several small ‘ swills ’ along the river. These, however,,
would pay poorly for shifting the plant. Note that eulo-
gistic reports on this property and Cybele have been
made by tbe same expert who reported Wyniford as
highly payable.
“North Eastern Tin Sluicing Co., Mount
Horror, is getting much puff. This field has been a frost.
It has been tried time and again, and the deserted camps
and abandoned tools remind one of a dilapidated fence
round a forgotten grave. The Mutual Hill is another
resurrection, being the old Mutual and Sarah Ann com-
bined. The Mutual was always a failure, and the Sarah
Ann wouldn’t keep a man in oatmeal. The Mutual
carries in pla es small seams of black stuff, which is
mostly iron and rubbish, with very little tin. Probably
some experts now operating on the coast would mistake
this lot for tin. The joining of these two shows into one
co is considerate, anyhow. It would have been cruel to
have debited us with two more wild cats. Another con-
cern that seems to have the reconstruction-on-a-large-
scale idea is the Abbotsford, on Main Creek. Co. has
150 acres or so of leases, mostly barren hills and terrace
ground. Cream of property is old tailings (about five or
six acres), which turned out the last clean-up—about two
tons for three months’ sluicing with three shifts. After
tailings have been worked out (and there is not a stagger-
ing amount of tin in five or six acres of a small creek’s
tailings), there will be another show to let.
“Fancy Creek shares are quoted at 80s. There
is neither lead, lode, nor defined tin-bearing formation
there. It is practically barren hills, with perhaps a
paddock or two of surfacing on it.”

Bendigo divs. for the year, £230,000; calls,
£175,281. For 1904 the divs. were £367,896, and the calls
£168,094. Nothing has turned up during the year to. take
the place of the Moon group, and there isn’t anything
that looks as though it might turn up during 1906.

“ All that is wanted,” says manager Ward in his
half-yearly report on Berry Consols (Vic.), “is dirt of a
little higher grade.” Everything lately developed has
been on the poor side, and there isn’t much satisfaction to
be got out of knowing that more dirt has been developed
than usual; so between heavy development costs and
poor yields the co. has gone £1539 to the bad, and now
has an overdraft of £1035. And things would have been
worse still if the tribute block hadn’t been passed on to
the Spring Hill and Central Leads, which has paid up £2729
in the six months. From the start £69,000 has been paid
in divs. on an output of £388,785 ; the divs. haven’t quite
returned the capital put into the mine (£75,500), so the
whole of the gold won and a bit more has been mopped
np in trying to beat the water and the poor drift.

“AtJ.W.” on a dust storm in Bourke
(N.S.W.):—
It is as hot as the infernal regions. The atmosphere, is
dead ; we cannot inhale enough air to supply us with
energy. We do nothing but drink, drink, drink—and are
overcome by a sense of oppressiveness. There is a deadly
stillness over everything..
And then we can see it coming, right over the horizon—
a light yellow mist at first, but as it approaches it takes
the form of a hug-e brown rolling cloud. It advances with
amazing rapidity. The birds and catcle become agitated
and seem to have a tendency to fly before it. Quickly we
close all windows and doors .and get the lamps ready.
Bart of the country is shifting, that is all.
It is almost upqu us ; the trees are beginning to shiver
in its breeze.' Then we find ourselves in the midst of a,
whirling cloud of grit, arid With a rush and a muffled
scjjtecli through the tr.es, like a horde of devils escaped,
it is upon us.,.
lyhaj^-VYas,the use of closing doors and windows? The
fine'diist penetrates everywhere. Snowy tablecloths are
covered with a thick coating and turn a dirty brown. It
gets'into the creases of the serviettes —the curtains are
full bPi’t. So are we. When we close our mouths the
grit'between our teeth sets them on edge'.
It is almost dark ; the lanips are now lit and there is an
evil sniell of bad kerosene,'. Worst of all it gets into our
beer, the counter is gritty, grit is everywhere, and we
swear accordingly. The whole'landscape is obscured, and
when we seek our camp we have to grope along the fences.
Night, comes, and it is still blowing strongly, but in
gusts I (t will soon be over !
Now, strangest thing of all, a few cold drops of rain
fall.. It is the irony of. Nature. You could count then) ;
and we want—we are famishing, starving—for inches of it.
The rain kills the dust like a charm—it disappears
entirely, and tile stars come out. And how cool it be-
comes! The temperature drops 40 degrees in an hour.
Vfe will get at least three cool days.
Failing rain, if it were not for the dust-storms we couid
not live. The nights would become so hot that we would
languish for want of sleep and fall victims to typhoid.
We sparkle up c.onsiderably, remarkably, as soon as it
becomes cool —we can breathe, we can fill our lungs with
pure air again. We go to bed about 2 a.m. When we
pull the mosquito-curtains down, we shake down a cloud
of impalpable dust, which stifles us and makes our nostrils
raw. We spring forth waving our arms, and frightful
language ensues. But it is only a reminder that we are
still in Bourke. I’ll get to Angledool if I have to walk.

In the S.M. Herald of December 2 the
charms of the Nepean River district are described;
among them : “To lure the sportsman is a
variety of game, including the shy and
) beautiful lyre, or mocking bird.” In face
' of the month-old N.S.W. Government
Gazette notice this “lure” to the sports-
man is an incitement to evil. But the ease
with which city dealers can undertake to
supply one with lyre-bird feathers (and any
other part of the bird wanted) indicates that
the prohibition against molesting the, shy
creature is disregarded by more than Herald
writers.
“ Roma ” : Down this way (South Gipps-
land, Vic.) there is nothing that causes so much
“divarshun” as a corpse. A farmer died the
other day, and the seeming gaiety of the neighbors
was something to marvel at. Work was suspended
for three days—the time being spent in shining up
harness,, mending rope reins, etc. The female
community put in its time gossiping about the
dead man, and making wreaths of wallfloWets,
red geraniums, etc. During the two nights that
the corpse was lying in state, the school kids topk
a holiday from home lessons. One mother wrote
this note :
You must excuse jonny fer ’is ’ome work out of respec
to the diseased mister brown who died las’ nig-ht of
stummik trouble to oblidge Mrs. Smith.
One woman at the dead man’s house remarked,
apropos of funerals, “ that it must be lovely to live
near a Melbourne cemetry an’ see all the fun’rils.”
Another female said that she wasn’t “orlful
gorne” on funerals, but “she loved bein’; in a
cem’try an’ readin’ the epithets.” . ,

“Ed” : If it were vigorously chopped at
now, the mistletoe, which is getting such a, hold
in many Victorian forests, could be stamped out,
as it is slow in spreading and has not too great a
hold as yet. It grows on any trees, evergreen or
deciduous, and is most numerous on trees near
open, well-watered grassland, or on trees near -to
water. Reason is, the seeds are dropped by birds,
which frequent places where water is obtainable.
The plant has leathery brown leaves. The fruit
is small; the seed is covered with a sticky juice
which does not leave it even after the bird has
digested it. Being dropped on a green limb, the
seed adheres and sends down two fine roots into
the bark. These tap the sap; and should a large
number of the parasites grow on the tree, it dies
of starvation. Lopping the branches affected or
cutting down a much-affected tree is the best
remedy.

“Wyung” : Have never seen any refer-
ence in “Abo’s” to the gigantic eels of the
Mitchell River (Vic.). I‘assisted at the'catching
of one that measured sft. Bin. by 16in. in girth,
and weighed 23Jlb. The brute’s head was like a
piece of wood that a, tribe of worms had dined on
for a year, and the carcase was covered with
of viscous stuff that stuck like glue. The Mit-
chellites call the species “ conger.” Now, I have
seen conger eels brought ashore in the fishing
boats on the Yorkshire coast, but they were not
in the least like this horror. Those eels (I saw
one lay out three men on the sand before it was
put to sleep with an axe) were silvery, and of ser-
pentine length for their bulk, whereas this eel was
short and “stubby,” dirty brown on the back,
heavily dotted with green, and white underneath.
The head was merely the coming of the body to a
sudden point. Chows like these eels, and lam
told that, boiled and fed to. fowls, the diet greatly
promotes laying.
THE MONKEY VARIETY OF HORRORS.
MULGA BILL (leaking up suddenly): “ Got' strw'A, I thought this was a temperance hotel!"
Thus a Queensland pressman :
J. T. Bell, Queensland Minister for Lands, when I knew
him, had few equals in the art of self-advertising. For
many years there was scarcely a book, pamphlet, official,
paper,'post-card, or bit of print of any kind published in
Queensland in which some mention or other was not
made of J. T. Bell, his father, his grandfather, or some
aborigine, dog, horse, or parrot belonging to the family
sometime within the last 50 years. And the humorous,
methods practised by J.T. to disguise the motives for
“ supplying the information ” have frequently left a pain
in the ribs of some cheerless scribe. Once had an idea of
writing up “ Pioneering on the Darling Downs.” It was
a barbarous idea, but still I had it. Bell heard of the
project, and sent me an enthusiastic invitation to join
him at Jimbour, the family station. He met me at the
railway station with a horse wrapped in long hair and
wearing long hoofs —one that jogged along with its head
down and groaned heavilv. All the way to the station
some 13 miles—Bell told me things about Warabah, a
marvellous blackfellow belonging to the family in ancient
days. According to Bell he was a big, powerful black, a
superior nigger—a good-looking, reliable, well-educated,
manly, humane aborigine. He was a fond and faithful
companion to Bell the elder—old Joshua used to take the
nigger to Brisbane with him whenever he went to open
Parliament. What part the darkey played in the cere-
mony isn’t quite clear. Before sitting down to tea at the
station,-Bell told me some more about Warabah. After-
tea he told me more about Warabah and produced the
dusky one’s photo. Going to bed Bell came to my doOr-
andsaid: “There’s one really laughable incident an old
hand here on the station tells about old Warabah. I
don’t remember the incident.” Next morning we set out
for the home of the oldest adjacent selector, from whom
we were to extract bales of valuable and authentic infor-
mation about Warabah. We found the selector sulking
in the middle of his slab humpy.
“ Haw ! ” Bell said. The old man glared at him.
“ My friend Mr. Reid, Jackson.”
Jackson glared at me. I made for a gin case on
the other side of the table, and sat down and took
out a note-book. The old chap looked at Bell again.
Bell tried to tempt him with a joke. It was a bad joke.
The old man didn’t see the point. Neither did I. Bell is
no good at a joke.
“I’m afraid we’ve struck the old chap at a bad time, ’
Bell said in a low tone to me, and stepped across the
room and lifted a big stone from the fireplace and sat
down on it.
“ Stool’s outside,” the old chap said, gruffly.
Bell thanked him effusively, and followed up his
success. . , „
“ Look here, Jackson,” he said, “ I want you to tell my
friend something about the old days. When did you first
come to the Darling Downs, Jackson?”
“Dunno.” ,
I wrote that down.
“Did you come before or after my grandfather,
Thomas Bell? You remember my grandfather, Jack-
son ? ”
I put’ that down, too. Bell looked baffled, and hesi-
tated a while ; then a good idea occurred to him, and
smiling he leaded forward and said to the old man—
“ You remember old Warabah, Jackson?”
The old man did. He lifted a long stick .... !! ! 1

into a dish of water, then gathering himself up he bolted

“A.H.8.”: You are astray in suggesting
the utilisation of waste “ends” of square jarrah
for hubs, spokes and felloes (16/11/’O5). Jarrah is
the most treacherous timber on earth for sharp
strains, much of it being so ‘ ‘ short ’ in the grain
that it snaps like the proverbial carrot. Have
seen green jarrah railway sleepers tossed off a
truck, snap in halves, and no one who knows the
timber would place as much reliance on it as upon
one of George Reid’s political assertions. For»
boards it is excellent; for posts and piles sunk in
the ground it is hard to beat, whilst a curly-
knotted root, thoroughly dried and seasoned,
would prove an ideal implement with which, to
knock sense into the heads of some of our suffering
legislators.
“ Lincoln ” : Queensland Government
Aboriginal Settlement, on Frazer’s Island, holds
a weekly dance for the blacks. Among the
bundles of old clothes sent to the settlement there
are often ball gowns, so the gins sport decollete
dresses. The men don’t put on much style, and
neither sex wears boots. When the dances were
first started there were so many rows because
some black men danced too often with other black
men’s sweethearts, that the rule was made that
the single men should dance with each other ;
only married men were allowed to dance with
girls. Then there were more rows than
ever. “ That fellow Jimmy, he dance all the time
alonga Mary,” was the explanation the super
would get when he went to see what the row was
about. Now both sexes have to dance separately,
and all is peace. The older aborigines are mostly
black; but among the younger are all shades,
many of the little children have fair hair and
blue eyes and not much trace of dark blood about
them.

The shearers’ ball, arranged by squatter
Prell, of Groulburn (N.S.W.), recalls the days of
early squatterdom, when every successful wool
season was followed by a shearers’ ball. If the
station buildings were not suitable, the School of
Arts or public school of the neighboring township
was requisitioned, and the squatter footed the
bill. The late B. D. Morehead was one of the
last survivors of that old crowd of wool-growers or
sheep-traffickers, though
B.D. degenerated in the
end, and used the
shearers’ ball as a
piece of water in
which to fish for
votes with a
view to next
election.

ANOTHER MAN FROM MAORILAND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A Maorilander replies indignantly to W. T. Goodge’s
verses, “The Man from Maoriland,” in Tun Bulletin’s
Christinas number. This paper has doubts about the
quality of the verse, but lets that pass on accourit of
the obvious sincerity.
You see I’m from Otago, so they starts (o show me
round—
They takes me to the “mountains,” but no mountains
could be found ;
A few hills and dales and rocky slopes, with here and
there a dell:
But as a treat for a Maori man—well, it was simply hell.
(Have you seen our lovely city, Orange ?)
They took me down to Bulli, and the Valley Kangaroo,
And thought they would surprise me with a really lovely
view ;
Up the Hawkesbury and Nepean, till we reached Burra-
gorang,
But I couldn’t see no scenery that was scarcely worth a
hang.
(Oh 1 for a week on the snowy slopes round Bourke !)
I tramped up Kosciusko, and, when I got on top,
Looked round and asked my Cornstalk (who nearly did a
“ drop ”):
“ Where’s the blessed mountain ? Why, there’s nothing
here to see ! .
They keep better in their backyards in our Maori
countrie.”
(What price our capital site, Dalgety ?)
I’ve been up the Manning, and Macleay, and up Orara,
too ;
They took me up the Paterson, and up the wild Paroo ;
In fact they took me everywhere, and everywhere was the
same.
I spent long weeks and months, till fairly wearied of the
game.
(By cripes, you ought to see the Lachlan !)
Lopking for views which weren’t there ! Although they
thought they were,
And then I made comparisons, aloud, which made them
stare.
I said that to a Maori their “ mountain ” was only “ hill,”
And their “river,” in Otago, would only spell a : “ rill.” ■
(Have you seen all the glories of our Centennial Park ?) r
Their sorrow was pathetic ; they said I had no soul—
No sense of the artistic, so they tried me with the bow 1—
The “ Devil’s Bowl,” I mean, that’s down Kiama way ;
It was weary and sickenin’, but I let ’em have their play.
(What price the Park at Parramatta ?)
They tried me with the “ harbor,” but they didn’t seem
to know
That here there’s only one ; Maoriland has dozens to show;
Each better than the'Sydney one from every point of
view.
Go, see them first, and then compare—that’s my advice
to you.
(Could the waterfall (?) at Katoomba be possibly sur-
passed ?)

stones was there at one time, and was known as
Cavlev’s Repulse, indicating the farthest point
reached by that naturalist and explorer. But
railway contractors and road-makers are not
sentimental, and the cairn most likely went to
ballast the railway line or macadamise the old

get about £4 per week in that country, and will
not tear themselves away from their gins and
homes for long. At the first civilised place a new
set of men are engaged at about £2 to £8 per
week ; and these, in their turn, seldom come as
far south as the border, for men can be got in
Southern Queensland for 255. per week and keep.

At a local option meeting in Fitzroy Town Hall, Melbourne, it was stated that alcoholised candy was being sold now for
children. The statement caused great consternation.


A small picture published on page 18 of our
issue of Dec. 7th bears a remarkable similarity to the
pictorial advertisement of Failures’ Phosphatine which
appears on another page. This similarity had not escaped
the artist who drew the picture ; and he would have men-
tioned the fact promptly had it occurred to him to be
necessary to do so.*
Politicians do not allow their festive cup to be
dashed by vain regrets of unachievement, as shown by
the cheerfulness of the Federal members at their break-
up the other day. Cheerfulness can always be obtained
by the right brand of refreshment—D.C.L. Whisky—even
when the right brand of politics is unobtainable. Just
the same—to be both Merry and Wise—is every good
man’s ambition. It is the proper state of mind for Xmas
and all other emergencies, festive and otherwise. The
D.C.L. temperament is the finest temperament obtainable
in humanity.*

PERSONAL ITEMS.
Bananaland’s new Governor, Chelmsford,
is, or was, a cricketer, and states his desire to get
a place in a Queensland representative team for
inter-State matches. Queensland is none too well
off for cricketers, and had better give his Ex. a
ti ial.
Chief Justice Stone, of Westralia, has
handed in his resignation, and Madden, of Vic-
toria, is confidently expected to do likewise next
year. _ Even the aged Darley, of N.S.W., whose
capacity for remaining seemed inexhaustible, will,
it js said, drop out within the next 12 months.
“ Wal. D.” : Ally Grainger, S.A.’s latest
ex-Agent-General, has taken a small office in
King William-street, Adelaide, and is selling or
trying to sell gramaphones. The job is just about
up to Grainger, but he looks tired, and in the dull
moments between records can be heard threaten-
ing to run for Parliament first chance.
“Via”: The pomposity of Janny Leahy
in Queensland Assembly is now almost unbearable.
Even “ me brother Paicv ” seems to wilt when the
member for Hullabooloo turns his swelled head in
the direction of his humble worshippers—said
worshippers being Patsy aforesaid and little Jen-
kinson.
John Whiteley King, the Maoriland press-
man who died last week, buried a lot of really
good research work in the Sydney Pastoralists’
Gazette. At one time his memory for statistics
was prodigious, and, strangely, that was the first
of his endowments that faded. Of late his almost
complete absence of memory was pathetic. He
died at 48.
“Melb.” : The late E. G. Fitz Gibbon had
a bad style in manner, speaking, and writing,
and would give a stranger the impression of being
a pretentious nobody. Audiences of every kind
seemed to be instinctively hostile to him, and he
could never be effective except in a crushing
statement of facts, though he was decidedly
eloquential.
One candidate for Egmont in the Maori-
land elections stood in the working man interest.
He appeared on the scene late, the district runs
over a wide area, and, being cashless, he swagged
it from place to place. The Labor League came
along with £2O to help him on his weary way, but
£lO of this had to be put up as deposit—which
was forfeited. The pedestrian candidate deserved
better luck.
A petition is now being signed asking the
Maoriland authorities to confine Lionel Terrey
(the monomaniac whose aversion to Chows im-
pelled him to shoot an aged sample in Wellington)
in a lunatic asylum instead of in gaol. Published
that all Terrey’s immediate relatives were insane,
but the statement lacks confirmation as yet. How-
ever, it wouldn’t be surprising to hear that he is a
victim to heredity.
E. A. Stone, who, at 58 years of age,
retires from the \Vestralian Chief Justiceship on
a pension of £lOOO a year, will, like Foster, of
N.S.W., be cited as an argument against pension-
ing Judges. Stone was “suspected of bad
health,” as Foster was, at date of appointment,
and if such instances were common, the State
would be justified in making candidates for the
Bench undergo a medical examination.
Minister of Defence Playford is the
breeziest and most casual of Parliamentarians.
Tom never bothers about the foolishness of having
a public manner as distinct from a private one
and talks in the House j ust as he would anywhere
else. Titles, even those of ordinary life, he can’t
be troubled with. “All right,” Tom will say
in reply to a dignified question from some other
Senator, “ I believe Forrest did say something of
the sort, but lam not certain. Perhaps it was
Turner. Anyhow, I’ll have a word with Deakin
and let you know.”
“BILLIE” HUGHES, M.H.R.
The lately deceased George Martin was
many years younger than his brother, the late
Ghief-Justice, _ and, unlike James, was an
Australian native. George, when young, took to
the sea, and had many adventures. When
nearing forty he gave up roving, and James, who
was then Premier, appointed him to command the
training ship Vernon, precursor of the Sobraon,
at. Cockatoo Island. Though quite an ancient
chap he started to read his brother’s law books,
and so qualified himself for a clerkship of Petty
essions. As soon as it could be decently done,
Janies had him shoved on to the Bench as a full-
own 1 .M., where he dutifully and unobtrusively
awaited his pension.
P. : The farce of the Federal Senate is
supplied by Simian Phraser. Usually he sits
alongside that lugubriods trinity—Pulsford, Gould
and Dobson—and remarks, “He-hah ! he-hah !”
(his method of signifying approval) in short, yelpy
tones. His rising to make a speech is hailed with
joyful yells by the other Senators. They interrupt
and interject till Simian gets horribly excited ; his
tt „ wa J s ’ prances, and he howls “ Hooh !
Ugh! many, many times. “I have been in
Australia 53 years !” he foamed at Trenwith the
other day. “ We’ll let you go away for nothing,”
Iren with replied. Simian has received benefits
from Australia for so many years that he has for-
gotten the habit of being grateful for them.
‘ Priam”: Re “S.S.’s” disgusted im-
pression (B. 7/12/’O5). I have sat and watched
Williemotor Kelly, and he is not contempt-
ible. In fact, I dare to draw a parallel
between him and
that virile champion
of Labor—Hughes.
Both have the same
ambition—to fight
their way to power
in debate. Hughes
is a wide and in-
dustrious reader—
so is Kelly. Labor-
leader and motor-
diiver alike are bit-
ter to those whom
they oppose. Kelly
shows, like Hughes,
an ability to grasp
and assimilate
quickly the matter
put before him.
But, then, the dif-
ference ! Hughes
has fought against
every obstacle that
fate can place in a
man’s way. He
was uneducated ;he
is now a lawyer and
a deeply-read econo-
mist. He was un-
healthy—he must
still diet himself and
chew pepsin con-
stantly to avoid
agonies of dyspepsia.
A physical defect once
made even articulate
speech difficult to him.
There is now no more
forceful debater in the
Federal Parliament. Kelly
was born to wealth and a
“college education,” and
has gone through life on a
motor-car. The greatest prob-
lem that has ever confronted him
lias been the fit of a waistcoat. With a valuable
equipment for success, he achieves nothing, be-
cause he has never been forced to learn howto
fight. Take away Kelly’s money and motor-car,
and drop him on a wharf to hustle for himself,
and he may develop into something pretty good.
Trample on a man for a while, and you compress
and strengthen his character. Leave everything
open to him, and he fizzles like loose gunpowder.
Kelly is still a squib.
“ Periwinkle ” : If there’s a day of reckon-
ing for any politician, that man is Jimmy M‘Coll,
M.H.R. Returned, after the run of his life with
Max Hirsch, as a Protectionist, and later against
the Freetraders’ Swan Hill nominee, Jimmy has
made enemies of his warmest fighters through
casting in his lot with the Opposition. The elec-
torate “up north” is waiting for Jimmy with a
waddy, and a gun, and a broken bottle, and a dog,
and a big rock, and an axe, and a length of gas-
pipe, and a sand-bag, and it also intends to back
a mule up against him.
“Glen” : The late Father Walsh, of
Otago, used to tell the following story against
himself: Meeting a Chinaman on the goldfields
one day, he, as usual, stopped for a yarn. “ Well,
John,” said he, “how do you like the English-
man ?” “No likee him ! Him too muchee ploud! ”
“Well, what do you think of the Scotchman?”
“No likee him too! Him too blankv mean!”
“Well, then, how do you get on with" the Irish-
men, John?” “Oh, all li ! Ilishman fine man.
He allee samee Chinaman ! ” Then Father W.
left in wrath and disgust.
Justice Real, of Queensland, never thinks
to himself on the Bench. Every thought gets
expression in words, generally with a flourish and
never without a snort. Then the sour Judge takes
time to tell the Court, in indignant tones, that the
Bench is under-manned. Cooper, C. J., also finds
half-an-hour or so every second day to say that
the Bench is under-manned. It is time that a
little agitation was set on foot by the public to
make these Judges do their work without so much
complaint, and to make them hustle a bit for their
£l5OO and £2OOO a year, with travelling expenses
up to £5 a day.
Once again some persons have proposed
that Premier Seddon should be next Governor of
Maoriland. But Seddon, as Governor, would
want to pull the strings all the time. Hori Grey
was Governor first and politician afterwards,
which is a different case. Anyhow a person
who allowed people to yell “ Dick ” after him in
the street instead of “ Your Excellency ” couldn’t
be tolerated for a moment. It would be mangling
all the aristocratic traditions of the office. And
when Governor Seddon was succeeded by a peer
and the people called him “ Mick ” through sheer
habit the heavens would fall.
Thomas Talbot Wilton, who bosses the
Lithgow Coal Association, and made contracts
with the Railway Commissioners which another
sort of Commission has been inquiringinto, wasover
30 years ago editor of a Bathurst paper, and “slung
ink ” with much pertinacity at the late Edward
Webb, M.L.C., then Mayor and local M.L.A.
Webb hoarded up the offending newspapers, and
when he had a fair bundle went for Wilton, who was
landed in Bathurst gaol for costs or something. B::t
after a few days Webb relented, and sent his
carriage with an order of release for the journalist.
Premier Price, of S.A., was recently
accused in the Critic, a local weekly dedicated to
vilifying the Labor party and all its works, of
being controlled by and attending the Labor
caucus. This was mentioned in the House, when
the Premier’s Welsh blood mounted to his head
in a rush, and, fixing his eye on the reporters’
gallery, he shouted “That is a lie, and the liar is
in the gallery now.” The Critic editor, a youth-
ful German who is also a reporter for the Register,
is said to have danced with fury and threatened
untold reprisals, but subsequently he thought
better of it, and did nothing.
“ Hassan ” : This indeterminate sentence
of N.S.W. bankrupt Waddell for contempt
presents some curious possibilities. There are
two obvious ways by which he may get out of
gaol; the law may get tired of keeping him there,
which is unlikely, or he may get tired of keeping
silence upon the point under dispute. This seems
just as unlikely, for Waddell would appear a
person of much obstinate wrong-headedness.
There is a third way, which shows some promise-
some compromise between the authorities and the
bankrupt. He might signify his willingness to
answer the question. He might then swear that
the missing money was divided between Edward
VII. and Mrs. Brown Potter, and get six months
for perjury, at the end of which sentence he
would be free again. As it now stands, he is in
some danger of dying in gaol. Whether per-
jury is a more serious crime than contempt is
doubtful, but it might possibly carry a definite
sentence.
A DANGEROUS OBSTACLE.
B OY: “ Yah! Gawd ’elp the tram that runs
into you! ”
David Storey, M.L.A. (N.S.W.), is a mad
hatter these days, and has spent the best part of
his time lately glowering at Premier Carruthers, of
whom he is a nominal follower. Some say that
his omission from the Deform Cabinet was the
beginning of a coldness which has grown until
now icebergs roll between Joseph and David.
Joseph’s latest sin has been to shift the boundary
of Randwick further back along the sandhills of
Moore Park. Storey was actually left off the
select committee which dealt with this subject,
and, on Carruthers explaining why, he darkly
remarked, “ That bird won’t fight, so don’t trot it
out.” It is understood that David Storey is form-
ing a party. It already consists of himself —and
the One Hatter is to make more noise than the
Six did.
Gov. Chelmsford and wife are making
themselves “ solid ”at Brisbane. “Chummy ”is
a fairly fluent speaker, and, though he can’t shed
the Oxford haw, it is obvious that he isn’t hawing
more than he can help. He made friends with the
pressmen right off. At the levee he bowled into
the room where they were at work sorting out the
1500 names of the crowd which flocked over the
grounds, planked himself down, and asked if they
wanted a hand, and called in something in the
refreshment line. Lady “ Chummy ”is under-
stood to contemplate a crusade against the
“bridge” mania which has bitten Brisbane
sassiety so badly that it gets to work on it as early
as 11 a.m.
Colonel Tom Price—the “fire-low” man
—lias been left in the sudden ruck of events.
He was retired from the forces while in Queens-
land, and applied for compensation, bringing
much political and social pressure to bear.
Defence-Minister M‘Cay refused the compensa-
tion, on the honest ground that it should not be
given to one man in preference to another. De-
fence-Minister Playford had barely come into
office (along with Deakin) when he provided for
the compensation. This (with similar compensa-
tion to Lieut.-Col. Bay ley) required a special
Appropriation Bill. The Bill came before Parlia-
ment in the last week of the session, and was
opposed by some of the Government’s supporters,
whereupon Deakin and Playford dropped away
and allowed the measure to lapse. Presumably,
therefore, Mr. Price will again fire low.
“F.” writes:—
The late Fitz Gibbon, Melbourne’s Bard of Works, was a
conspicuously humorless Irishman. There are others, like
Waxcellency Madden, whose brightness and genial de-
meanor make amends for their lack of the national sense
of humor, but Fitz was always solemnly in earnest. He
summed himself up some years ago when he addressed
the little crowd at a Melbourne artists’ smoke-concert as
though it was a public meeting, and said, in his deep,
rolling tones : “ Squeeze me as hard as you like, you can
get back none of the entertainment I have been absorb-
ing. There is no fun in me.” He never could laugh at
Fitz Gibbon, or he would not have persisted in writing
bad verses, sometimes in praise of himself. He con-
sidered his O.M.G. degree a great “honor,” and would
have accepted a knighthood with tears of gratitude as a
personal favor from the King. Yet for all his vain
imaginings he was a fine old fellow —a public-
spirited citizen and a well-meaning autocrat. It has
always been recognised that Fitz was a jealous
defender of Melbourne’s early public reserves against the
encroaching powers of jobbery. A Tory by education,
associated with the kid-gloved classes before he left Eng-
land in 1852, Fitz was a staunch Australian at a time
when his official contemporaries talked of Britain as
“ home.” He had progressive ideas as to how Parliamen-
tary business should be carried on, and he was about 40
years ahead of his old enenp', David Syme, in denouncing
the evils of Party Government. A pamphlet on the sub-
ject was one of the first things he published. One of the
last things he published was a letter to Syme—a foolish
attempt at Scawtch dialect —in which he declared that
the Age proprietor had borne a grudge against him for
nearly half a century. It said a good deal for Fitz-
Gibbon’s force of character that he was able to enjoy the
rancor of Syme for so long a period without really
hating him in return. A man of dignity hates nobody ;
and Fitz had dignity enough for six.
“ C.” : Tommy Bent is accused of poetry
along with his other sins. Parkes had the fever
for a while, and that famous published verse cf
his which said that the ram was on the roof i;
not yet forgotten. White Knight Fitz Gibbon wrotn
many poems—one at least on sewage. Reid got
as far as a 2s. volume. EvenLyne has been accuser 1
of struggling with an epic, but there is no visible
evidence. Bent’s poems deal chiefly with old pot-
houses, empty cradles, old pioneers whose spirits
have departed, deserted cattle runs and the like.
Not having the gift of recitation, he sings his
compositions without music; what they would be
with music heaven only knows. Bent, leaping
like a goat on the hill-top, is a thing of interest
even to London papers, which condemn the
frivolity of Australian politicians—as if Hackett
or J. C. Neild or Deakin could ever be frivolous,
or Bigjohn Forrest could bring in his financial
statement while standing on his head, or Simon
Fraser could be expected to enter Parliament on
all-fours as a general thing.
“L.”: When an elderly property-owner
walks about Melbourne in an unusual species of
kilt, with long white locks streaming from under
his “bonnet”, his appearance leads to all sorts of
quaint surmises. Saw Mr. Theodore Napier, the
gentleman in question, proceeding up Nicholson-
street towards the Aquarium the other day, pro-
bably reflecting, as he walked, on England’s unjust
debarment of Mary IV., of Herzogenaurdch or
Mesopotamia, from its throne. No such exalted
thoughts crossed the minds of the citizens who
were following him. They engaged in arguments
as to whether the Jacobite leader was to do a
sword dance, or give an exhibition of throwing
the hammer and putting the shot, and the
Aquarium turnstiles clicked rapidly as they
trooped in to satisfy their curiosity. But when
the programme turned out to be bare of anything
beyond the usual display of seals, mummies,
£. £. Smith’s snuffbox, etc., the sightseers left the
building with a feeling that they had been “ had,”
and that somebody ought to speak to somebody
about appearances calculated to deceive.
“ S.”: Saw Tom Playford for the first time
the other night. I walked into the Senate, and
there he was, leaning back in his chair like an old
walrus. I remembered him the moment I set
eyes on him. I had seen him hundreds of times
before, but he used always to be wearing clothes
made of stars and stripes and a funny-looking pot-
hat. He used to be called Uncle Sam, too. In
the Senate, Playford was holding a pencil, where,
as Uncle Sam, he holds a big cigar. I watched
him open-mouthed as one always watches a figure
that has stepped down from a well-known picture.
While the Senators on his side of the House were
talking he was agreeable, saying “ Hear ! hear ! ”
every two-and-a-halt minutes in a ponderous
voice, that was obviously only at about half-cock.
When Dobson, from the Opposition, got up to say
a few things, Uncle Sam —I mean the Minister
for Defence—altered his whole demeanor. His
eyes retreated into his head. His goatee bristled
and twinkled. He pulled out from somewhere a
toothpick like a javelin or a bayonet. Dobson
was visibly dismayed, but held on in a trembling
voice. Then he made some remark about the
Minister for Defence, and Playford, with the
bayonet toothpick grasped threateningly, leaned
over the table. The ponderous voice was dragged
into action and discharged at Dobson with a roar
that made the roof feel giddy and the pillars of
the Chamber reel. Dobson must have been badly
wounded by the discharge, for, with a few faint
moans, he sank into his seat, and Tom Playford
shut up the javelin toothpick, leaned back in com-
fort, and said “Hear ! hear ! ” as Senator Givens
rose to speak.
NOT DISAPPOINTED.
FRIEND : “ The smoke concert came off all right ?”
FULLER: “Not yet (hie). Been post(hic)poned.
Mad a fine rehearsal though (hic)."
Ex-Premier Philp, who dates from 1886,
is the “father” of the Bananaland Assembly,
though not by any means an old man. Banana-
land electors made such a clearing out in recent
years of the unspeakable crowd which pawned
the country that the old stock remaining can be
easily reckoned up. One Heussler, who speaks
guttural, or pigeon, or some other sort of English,
which would be better understood in the Reich-
stag, is the oldest hand in the House of Fossils,
where they remain till nature has pity on the
public. Heussler started his unintelligible career
as an M.L.C, in 1866, and somehow dropped out
in 1870, but was promptly re-appointed for fear
the country should perish without him. _______

About the latest grovel to Japan :
There is something; beyond affability in the Bill regard-
ing alien immigrants that the affable Deakin has just
carried through the House of Representatives. I>kakin
has withdrawn from the Immigration Restriction Act tne
bastard clause regarding the language test (inserted under
pressure from the politicians who ruled the piebald
Empire), and has substituted another, which is of even
more mongrel birth. The first clause came of a cross
between a White Australia and a Piebald Empire, lhe
last clause has a strain of yellow added to it. Avowedly
in order to placate the Monkey people of Japan,
Deakin (assisted by Watson, who is also showing
dangerous signs of affability) has given future Ministers
power (unless Parliament should declare its disapproval)
to proclaim that the language used as a test may be not
European, but of any other continent that they maj
choose. This is done, avowedly, in order that it may
appear on the statute book that Australia will not
legislate against anyone who can talk Japanese. Even
. when the original Act was framed, the Monkey made
representations about some such concession, but uas
refused. Since then things have happened. The Monkey
has won in a fierce struggle with Russia. Deakin
says that no fresh requests have been made to him
from Japan or Britain ; and yet, apparently with
the idea of placating the blood-drunk Monkey, he
has introduced this Bill. He prostrates himself
voluntarily at the feet of the grinning conqueror.
White Australia is not a legislative certainty, but only a
tradition, with nothing but public opinion to ensure that
Ministers will not allow it to weaken. At present it
appears likely that public opinion is strong enough to
prevent any Minister, however subservient to Bn tain Gi-
lts colored allies, from administering the Act otherwise
than so as to exclude the Hindu, the Jap, the
Chinaman, the Syrian, the nigger, and all the other
discolored friends and props of the Empire. But there is a
danger that the grit that has proved wanting in legisla-
tion may some day prove absent in administration. Par-
liament knuckled down to Chamberlain three years ago.
It grovels before Japan to-day. Some day a similar or a
worse—Parliament will be asked by Japan, or China, 01
England to alter the administration of the Act, and there
will be nothing in the vicinity to stop it from falling on
its stomach again. The proposition is a humiliation, a
pretence, and a danger, A humiliation, because it kneels
to the victorious Monkey ; a pretence, because the Minis-
try avows an intention of never using its provisions , a
danger, because it yields a step to Japanese pressure, anc
makes the next step an easier one to yield.

“Two Seas’’ on a N.S.W. land point:
A Sydney Telegraph correspondent, upholding the
Land Court against the Land Boards, quotes two Dubbo
cases wherein the Land Court had reduced the rents from
8d. to 4d., and triumphantly inquires—“What would
have happened if there had been no appeal to the band
Court in such cases ? ” The answer is that, through the
Land Court interfering in cases which it can know precious
little about, the State is robbed of half its income. The
Land Court may be of use in deciding intricate points of
law, but when it interferes with matters of fact which
the local Boards are better qualified to decide, the Court
usually makes an ass of itself. The indisputable fact is
that on all the good lands of the State, whether used for
grazing or wheat-growing, there is fully one shilling per
acre more profit now to be made than there was in the
early nineties, when rents were fixed at 2d. to 3d. pel-
acre ; and if the Crown tenants get only half of that
extra shilling they are still much better off
than the good old “ stragglers ” of the nineties.
Present writer was one of them—paying 2Jd. per acre
for land that carried a sheep to 1J acres in a “ not too
good” season, and it is only since he has paid to private
owners a rent of 4s. per acre for much inferior grazing
land that he realises what a good thing he had on when
he was one of the well-advertised “ stragglers ” described
by tearful land agents as being “ ruined by a rack-renting
Government.” In those days we had to be satisfied with
6d. and.fijd. per lb. for medium quality wool, and -s. fed.
for our surplus weaners. Now we can get more than
double those prices. Why then draw attention to the
fact by howling at a rental of 8d. ? And why on earth
should the Land Court, that knows no more about the
carrying capacity of the land it is asked to give judgment
upon than a meat-axe, reverse the decision of the men on
the spot, who have something more than perjury to guide
them ?

Whenever any measure is brought forward
which enforces the payment of fair wages and
compels decent conditions, an agonised entreaty
is made that these provisions shall not be applied
to the rural industries. And the appeal is almost
always successful. The House of Reps, has even
decided to exempt rural—including viticultural —
industries from the incidence of the union label.
At present the country workers, so far as the un-
skilled labor of the farms and the partly-skilled
labor of the creameries and butter-factories is con-
cerned, are scandalously underpaid. There is no
valid reason for such sweating. If this labor wei e
organised—which would be the result of industrial
legislation affecting it —there would be a serious
inroad on the fat profits of the rich land-owner.
Surely the same spirit that overcame very serious
obstacles and formed the shearers’ unions can
tackle the problem of organising farm labor.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, December 26, 1905.
My Dear Arini,—
An exhibition of manufactures and products is
usually so dry a proceeding that it has to have a
“dressing” made for it. Choral music, full
bands, side shows, a Governor to cut the blue
ribbon that barriers the main pavilion and to
declare the show open, speeches and bunting.
Several moons ago N.S.W. branch of the
A.N.A. had an inspiration to hold a giant show
of Australian manufactures and products, and at
noon on Wednesday last the Exhibition was
opened by Governor-General Northcote, who railed
from Melbourne for the purpose. There are some
500 private exhibitors as well as the Governments
of the different States and the Chambers of Manu-
facturers. Marrickville tweeds, as worn in frocks
by Lady Northcote, and pottery, majolica, and
terra-cotta of the kind bought by her to decorate
still further her “house beautiful” hold an
honored place. Schools, private and public, make
a splendid show of modelling, penmanship and
mapping. Last is slow work—perhaps the girls
who made the cookery demonstrations had had a
long course of it, else they’d been chloroformed.
One damsel was preparing an Irish stew. At the
rate she worked that stew ought to be ready to-
day. Another spent seven minutes (by a stop-
watch) in paring one apple.
Vice-Admiral and Lady Fawkes were at the
Exhibition on opening day. He is a stalwart
person ; she a gentle, fragile-looking, very grey-
liaired one. They are childless ; their one off-
spring died early.
“ Simplicity—a single blossom against a back-
ground of nothing at all.” The woman voter in
Maoriland is sometimes as guileless as that blos-
som. At the recent elections one of her voted,
but came back in half an hour and requested the
returning-officer to let her alter the vote. Since
crossing out the name of a certain candidate, she
had recollected that he once performed a kindly
service for her son. On the official declining, she
told him indignantly that she’d never vote at his
miserable old booth again.
A royal road, recently opened by novelists and
dramaturgists, that leads to a happy and wealthy
marriage is that trodden by the professional girl-
thief. The apotheosis of the lady of light morals
was a failure—both Mrs. Tanqueray and Iris
reaped their whirlwind. So the apotheosis of the
lady of light fingers has' begun. Whilst Tittell
Brune, as Leah Kleschna, was burgling jewels at
Her Majesty's, Nellie Stewart, as Nance
Olden, a Bowery tough, was sneaking watches,
clothes, sugar tongs, and spoons at the Crite-
rion. They both taught the same lesson.
If you know of an extremely eligible young man,
a creature of club, claret, and turtle, a gay-doggy
man, but with a moral standard high and white
as Mount Kosciusko in mid-June, go and burgle
his bedroom and let him catch you at it. Then
swagger, brazen it out, and “sass”him. He’ll
know that at heart you are a baby-lamb, and a
gentlewoman, and have all the cardinal virtues
concealed about your pretty and becomingly-
dressed person. In a few months King-street will
be blocked by the swarm of gazers waiting to see
you come out a bride from St. James’s Church,
your bridegroom being the gentleman whose room
you plundered, and there will be nary a pick-
pocket present to give you away or to levy on your
guests.
How I wish that there were a lot of John the
Baptists about to eat up the locusts. Superior
persons assert that the locust eaten by the Saint
was a fruit, not the clamorous cicada that scrapes
its fiddle at the top of its voice all the long hot
days and some of the short hot nights in Sydney
at present. But I like to think of him eating our
kind of locusts, music and all —eating the whole
brass band, so to speak. Which reminds me
that at the A.J.C, races, on Saturday, a young
woman wore a hat, in several shades of green,
trimmed with locusts. There were 14 locusts on the
brim and crown, and their delicate tone of green
harmonized well with the damsel’s other tints and
hints of verdancy. When she came and sat below
other women on the stand they grew pop-eyed
staring at the winged outfit, and speculated as to
how she caught it. My cat brings me a bushel a
day, silenced but quite unmangled. In future,
keep a cat to catch your millinery.
It was a small, sleepy race-meeting. The
majority of the women carried their veils behind
them fluttering like white “surrender” flags, a
yard or more in length. The French Consulate
to the extent of the chief, Madame, and Mdlle.
Pinard came, and several Australiennes who are
French scholars balanced up to remark that the
meeting was not a rekerky one, and that the
grand-standers were dressed neglijay. Mrs.
Philip Morton, Mrs. Monty Severn, Mrs. Irving-
Keys, and a few officers from the Powerful—
in their other clothes—were around, but nearly
every one looked as if he or she were recovering
from chloroform.
Mr. Frank Gardner, who is still anchored here
by mining interests, cast an expert eye over the
horses. At least I suppose it was expert, for
Australians used to follow with interest the
pedigree and performances of his big stable in
London what time Tod Sloan was riding for him,
and his sixty horses were named after the various
States and cities of his native land.
The A.J.C. has cemented a great patch of its
Rand wick reserve —the patch under the trees
where the bookies stand —and it now shows blind-
ing white. Bookies and their patrons will have to
wear blue specs, or green goggles to modify the
glare. The odds look smaller than ever with that
huge splash of snowball radiance for a back-
ground.
The man who is writing the late Mr. “Jack”
Want’s biography is barrister Lyons, who married
Mr. Tom Slattery’s pretty little daughter—the
only daughter he had. Lyons was in chambers
with Want, and the warrior K.C. often spoke of
him as a coming man.
Miss Vinia De Loitte’s marriage to her beloved
relic, Howard Vernon, is postponed for a time.
Surgeons and undertakers are kept so busy; by
appendicitis that there are signs of revolt against
the operation. Many persons have banded them-
selves together under the style and title of the
“ Society for the Preservation of the Appendix,”
and are going to take the risk of not being operated
on should they get It. So many deaths, and so
many slow or incomplete recoveries after opera-
tions, are scaring those who have not got It. Miss
Edwina Geach, Mr. Edwin Geach’s sister, who
underwent the obliterating act three months ago,
died on Christmas morning. She was a lovable
and gifted girl, and was promising well as a writer.
This event, coming almost on the same day as the
passing out of swimmer Kieran, is calculated to
make the once honorable operation unpopular.
The till-we-meet-again fuss that raged around
Tittell Brune on Saturday night beat hollow the
flattering welcomes and farewells offered to Melba,
Crossley, or any recent dramatic stars. At the
Australia Hotel doors the police had to rescue
Miss Brune from a crowd, mainly of women. All
along she has had her “water-lily girls,” her
“pansy girls,” her “ rose maidens” and “carna-
tion damsels.” These were so named from the
flowers they used to send her. And the jewelled
trinkets and pet animals that poured herward at
Chistmas-tide ! No wonder she says there’s not
another country like this for generosity.
Nellie Stewart’s cabin on the American boat
reminded of the first scene in “Florodora.”
Floral decorations nearly crowded out the star.
She stayed in it to say her many good-byes.
Numbers of the farewellers carried books of devo-
tion, and explained that they had hurried out of
church and cut the sermon to wish Nellie
good luck. Men farewellers ran round looking
for “Mussy,” but left without .finding him. In
Mr. J. C. VVilliamson’s speech [at Her Majesty’s
on Saturday night he, with sympathetic cuteness,
hoped that the United States would make our
Australian Nellie as heartily welcome as the
Commonwealth had made Tittell Brune and other
American artistes.
Prior to leaving Miss Stewart showed her
friends three pieces of lovely Irish crochet lace
made by a girl in Melbourne. They were a deep
cape, a pair of cuffs, and a “tail.” So intricate,
delicate, and varied was the design one could
scarcely realise that the lace was made by hand-
just two human hands —and that there was no
intervention of Providence in the matter. The
maker was a whole year over the three inspira-
tions. Miss Stewart could have sold the cape
alone for £5O right on the spot.
Florence Young, going out to dinner on Christ-
mas evening from her hotel, was all in white glace
silk, tucked vertically and half-hidden in a big
c:>at of the same, short-waisted with Oriental gold
embroidery, bediamonded, and her hair planted
with combs of dead gold.
A quaint tale comes from under the cocoanuts
of Niue (the Pacific islet which Cook dubbed
Savage because its inhabitants wore their beards
between their teeth and threw sharp stones at his
men). Niue is one of the happy hunting-grounds
of the missionary men, and all the people contri-
bute very liberally of their nuts and dried shark
to the Plate. One of the island’s deacons, a
brown pietist of “some spirit,” as Scott would say,
took to wife a giddy young damsel, who was
looked at askance by the matrons of the church.
His fellow-deacons took the case to the parson,
and the husband was taken to task for his ungod-
liness. Then he went out on strike. He
publicly made a bonfire of his good Sunday tog-
gery—celluloid collar, heavy frock coat, antique
belltopper, and elastic-side boots—and renounced
with violent language the church and all its
clothes. The pervert is now happy with his frisky
wifelet, and doesn’t goto church or Sunday-school
any more, but sits in the seat of the scoffer, clad
in nothing but sunshine and cocoanut oil, and
throws nutshells at the perspiring clothed wor-
shippers when they come out of morning chapel.
Adelaide’s religious bickerings generally take a
X>eculiar form. For some weeks past, columns of
the Register have been devoted every day to fierce
letters for and against the use of incense in church.
At last a desperate wag, signing himself “Censor,”
wrote to say that, though it was a burning ques-
tion it was useless for anyone to get incensed
about it because it must all end in smoke. And
the correspondence was hastily closed.
Some notes from Maoriland :
Quaint things one may still see travelling through
Maoriland. A voyager on the Wanganui River tells of
visiting a village where the party was met by a squad of
Maori girls all rigged out in gorgeously-colored prints and
red stockings, and armed with double-barrelled breech-
loaders. “ They formed up in guard-of-honor order on
either side of us, and fired a salute of three volleys
over our heads as we walked between the ranks. We
heard the bullets whistling over us and pinging against
the rocks, and thanked our stars the Darktown Amazons
were not pakeha ladies, else had they certainly plugged
us by mistake instead of the cliffs behind us. But they
neither blazed away from the hip with their faces turned
the other way, nor winked they a single wink, nor did
they drop their guns and faint. They looked just the
girls to have defended a pah by the sides of their hus-
bands and brothers, as mauy a plucky M.L. wahine has
done in the past.
“ The little Maori is literally ‘in hot water ’ from his
birth onwards in the Rotorua regions. The small brown
infant, as often as not, comes to light on the brink of a
warm natural bath, or the family washing spring, and it
isn’t very long before it is puddling in the soft steaming
waters and sucking precociously at its mother’s old black
tobacco pipe. Some of these lakeland eaters of the lotos
—or its Maori equivalent, the kumara—seem to spend half
their days and nights lolling like Turkish sultanas in their
open-air warm baths, and letting creation slide. Some-
times they die in the baths, for no other reason, appar-
ently, than that it is too much trouble to get out and die
dry on the grass.
“The other morning old Hemi Tupara (‘Double-
Barrelled Jimmy’), the chief medicine-man and sooth-
sayer of Ohinemutu, strolled down to his favorite
bathing-spring on the lake-shore, and was, a little later
on, found peacefully dead in the water. Likely as not,
the old man’s atua had whispered him that death was at
hand, and he elected to pass out in the most comfortable
method known to his easy-going race.”
That bride who, some six months ago, on the
first day of her honeymoon, fell from the balcony
of an hotel in the Blue Mountains is still alive, but
has not even yet recovered full consciousness.
Miss Jean Brenan, the plucky girl who runs the
smart little flower and food shop in George-street,
is, with three or four other happy though un-
married Misses, planning a run to Europe. Miss
Brenan, a daughter of the late Justin Brenan,
who was a twig of a clan with a very tall family
tree (so tall that you could only reach the topmost
ancestor with a fire-escape), has a unique place
even in democratic Sydney society. One hour
she’ll be working like a beaver decorating a table
on a man-o’-war for a dinner, or the room for a
club ball; the next finds her in gala array a guest
at the dinner or ball.
Mayoress Allen Taylor reigned over a meeting
called to consider arrangements to raise funds for
endowing a cot in memory of Lady Rawson at
R.A. Hospital for children. The meeting didn’t
get to bedrock, and decided to procrastinate till
it could ask Sir Harry Rawson what form he
would like the memorial to take.
The question “ What is a gentleman ? ” —which
Melbourne Argus vainly tried to settle during
one of its frequent silly seasons—is at last fixed
beyond argument by the writer of a recent book
on “ The Simple Life,” who asserts that
“a gentleman never perspires.” Some Block
Johnnies have been so impressed by this state-
ment that they have declined to move out of doors
during recent hot spells.
A Brisbane correspondent writes :
Governor Chelmsford’s arrival in Brisbane fitted in
opportunely with the opening of the Art Gallery in its
permanent quarters on the top floor of the new Lands
pile. His and her Ex., however, had to climb the three
flights of stairs, for the electric lift turned dog and re-
fused to budge an inch after the precious party boarded
it. Up to that very moment it had energetically hoisted
everyone. When it had done its wicked act the im-
plement started work again ; consequently, when their
Exes had arrived panting and breathless at the top of
things they found the recalcitrant beast of burden bound-
ing up gaily like a kangaroo, and discharging large
cargoes of Thomas, Richard, and Henry, and other
ordinary citizens. The scared officials promised
to wallop the lift severely for its unseemliness.
“ Chummy ” said something about art, and every now and
again he rubbed in the fact that last year the trustees had
£23 to spend on new pictures. At the risk of a disruption
in the Executive ranks he expressed the hope that, with
Queensland’s expanding revenue, a trifle more might leak
out for the institution. Then the lift lowered him down
gently, and a few hours later he was being cheered
by the hilarious audience at Skuthorpe’s bull and cow
and horse show.
A Yankee journal states that President Roose-
velt’s daughter Alice said “Yes” to a persistent
suitor—Congressman Nicholas Longworth—as the
result of his risking his life to save a sailor from
drowning. They were fellow passengers aboard a
steamer voyaging to the Philippines and Japan
when Longworth got his chance to do the gallant
deed, whereupon the lady showed so much ad-
miration for her damp hero that he repeated his
tender advances, and sweet Alice found him irre-
sistible this time. Perhaps he bribed the sailor to
fall into the water —but no matter.
It takes a good deal to stagger an Australian
postmaster, but one of them rocked on his basis a
while back on receiving a letter from the vast in-
terior of Portuguese East Africa. Said letter
contained a pretty girl’s photo, an epistle ad-
dressed to the “ Unknown Alicia,” and an earnest
appeal to the P.M. to make every effort to ascer-
tain the original of the photo and deliver the
unknown Alicia’s letter to her. The P.M.
rounded up his letter-carriers, and among them
they placed the lady. It seems Alicia knew an
officer on a tramp steamer, and wrote him care of
the London agents. Woman-like, she only put
the name of her town at the head of the letter.
The agents only remembered one man of that
name, and forwarded the letter to him at the
P. 0., Capetown. The Capetown Postal officials
didn t know him from an antelope, but they had
a re-direction order for the same name,
and Alicia’s letter capered over three-parts
of Africa, and dodged many lions and other
wild animals, before being handed to the wrong
man in the far, dim interior. But he read it, and
was impressed, and when Alicia read his letter
she was impressed ; and the end of it was that a
slab of indigestible cake has just reached that
postmaster from Portuguese East Africa.
Women and surplices—why in the world should
they not combine ? But it is rather odd that here
women should be upbraided because they want to
put things on. In England they are being cen-
sured for wanting to take things off ! Some clergy-
men are most annoyed at their coming to church
minus hats or bonnets. A correspondent tells me
that St. Paul’s, Melbourne, first introduced the
surpliced women to Australia (not Brisbane, and
Tamworth churches, as Sydney Telegraph has
it), and the cathedral had to issue early-door
tickets to cope with the rush for a near view of the
appropriately-garbed angels. Apart from their
seraphic draperies, they were a picked lot. The
old rector, Dr. Bromby, had a fine appreciation of
feminine beauty wherever he found it. He
married the choicest of the bunch, a girl with
violet eyes, 19 years old, and of a very humble
family. The Doctor was over seventy at the time,
but there was a keen competition for his notice
and bitter jealousy of the successful bidder.
From the number of luncheon and tea rooms
that infest Sydney you would scarcely realise that
there is room for another. But there is. It
would have to be run by a woman who has an
instinct for the perfection of waiting and sim-
plicity—and perfection in the preparation of food.
At how many places can you get coffee—made as
they make it before the Great White Throne?
Consider tlie salads served to you—made with an
oil that shouldn’t ever enter into a salad and with
malt vinegar. What a lack of good tea and first-
rate brown breads. What a vacuum there is for
the perfectly cut chop that is a poem, and
the fillet of steak that is an epic, perfectly
grilled on a silver grill. I heard a man
the other day reminiscing on his first introduction
to the Australian wine trade. It was some 12 or
14 years ago in Melbourne. He and a friend went
into a cellar-like room, snow-white as to walls,
and with fresh sawdust on the floor. An old
German, beautifully laundered, climbed up to a
shelf and got the customers a bottle of white wine,
handling it reverently, as if it were the holy grail.
Then he drew the cork as if it were a sacrament, and
most gently he filled two tall, quaintly-engraved
glasses. With the wine he gave them black bread
and sausage. And the charge was sixpence each.
Because of the goodness of the wine, and the
absolute cleanliness and simplicity, and the
promptitude of the waiting is that circumstance
made memorable.
“Linthorpe,” a fine old-time N.S.W. man-
sion situated on the railway line close to
Newtown Station (Sydney) was recently offered
bythe proprietor, Mr. J. T. Brown, the well-known
broker, to the Newtown Council for £6000. The
ancient mansion is surrounded by beautiful trees
and the gardens are a delightful oasis in that
wilderness of bricks, mortar and dust. Newtown
lias no park, and the ancient building, all
lined with cedar from the Northern Rivers,
would have been an ideal place for Algernon
and Angelina to have sworn eternal fidelity
in, while gazing at the place where the
rude forefathers of the best society drank their
rum. The Newtown Council was very anxious to
secure the place, but having no money and lacking
the energy to raise any, it organised a deputation
to Premier Carruthers. As usual, that gentleman
didn’t say “yes” and didn’t say “no,” and while
he was balancing on one leg the owner’s patience
gave out, and he sold the property in the open
market, and got much more money for it.
Miss Vivienne Noel, that foreign-looking little
Queenslander who has frozen so lovingly on to
Tittell Brune, goes to America by-and-bye to
marry a civil engineer named Clapp, one of the
Melbourne family of that name.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, December 25, 1905.
My Dear Yarrie,—
Federal Parliament occurrences have lost their
glamor for the sex. The Prorogation saw the
seats of the mighty mostly going to waste, and
nobody sat where the Somebodies usually flaunt.
The consultation box, where the referee settles
during Senate debates, was used up by Dame
Northcote and her Jersey visitor. The benches
next in importance yawned behind the pair. The
cheerful Ex. contributed faintly sentimental
mauve chiffons and a lorgnette to the scene.
When mauve isn’t deep and wicked, it is yearn-
fully sentimental. The Jersey countess looked
like a Sargent or Longstaff canvas of a Lady in
Black. When the Jersey dame falls short
of the canvas effect, she passes for an elderly
governess of strict deportment and many
drawing-room accomplishments. In the lower
gallery, Melbourne’s Mrs. Worship sat in
warm-looking raiment and a hat that mercifully
left at least a portion of chin exposed. Millinery
at a very forward tip has a foolish way of shutting
the complexion from view.
Private-Sec. Share is up-to-date the most jovial
official to clank heel and bob a nude pate to a
proroguing Ex. At Thursday’s performance, the
jolly phiz of the G.-G.’s handy-man was as cheer-
ful a sight as a stylish toque in a Methodist chapel.
Only when the absence of some Bills was discovered
and the P.-S. had to trot with whispered tidings
from the G.-G. to the Speaker and vice versa did
the bald-topped chappie lose any of his glad glow.
President Baker made a little effort at refresh-
ment after the proroguery. The two dames from
greater Guv’ment House were asked to walk into
the red-tape parlor and sip tea. Half-a-dozen
others were also bidden to a scone. This com-
passed the Commonwealth Parliament’s range of
entertaining. Fortunately one has the whole hot
season in which to recover from the effects of such
wild dissipation.
The close of Parliament postpones one problem—
what the wives of members were to do to prevent
the Gallery sirens from exercising their wiles on
legislators. Quite a school of ‘ ‘ Killers ” regularly
haunts lobby and gallery, searching for the big
whales of politics, or, failing them, even the little
minnows. And politicians’ wives didn’t like to
see their husbands subjected to this organised
attack. So the other day there was a conclave.
A syndicate was about to be formed of the
aggrieved, to provide for one of their number being
always on the spot to report matters to the others
and to nip the festive flirtation in the bud with a
closure ruling. However, the syndicate had only
been thought of when Parliament closed, and the
sirens are left with naught save the cobwebs of
the House to flirt with. Perhaps with a new
session the Politicians’ Wives Protection Associa-
tion will be revived.
The Forrests and Reids went off in a sort of
Bull-and-Bush rush for the Holy City last
Wednesday to ship by the Oruba. The Reids are
bound for the spicy Indian port where G. H. Reid
will practise falling asleep in a rickshaw drawn by
a liquorice-colored coolie. That is if a darkie
can be found in the Empire to pull George’s
bulk.
Mrs. Buchan’s moonlight-on-the-Yarra party
was a glamorous spree with lanterns, fern-nooks,
gleams of the stream, and music en suite. Bridge
—a desecration for such soft hours —was played
by a swarm of resolute she-gam biers.
An aged and frisky politician, hailing from a
State that produces nothing much giddier than
apples, sat so long in the moonlight at
this show admiring a garden view of the
landscape with a gentle dame that he missed
the last ’bus, and had to go back to the
city by a long dreary march in the young
hours of the morn, solus. Brother politicians
twitted the aged Romeo, and he was anxious to
impress them that he dallied late for sheer love of
walking. In proof of the perj ury he now takes
long painful walks, for publication, and as a
guarantee of good faith, and is like to injure his
walking members beyond repair in the effort to
establish his veracity. Yet, as a rule, the aged
trifler is rather proud of a little flirtation which
makes him miss the last ’bus.
The promenade strut of the assorted girls of this
Bent State requires re-modelling. It’s in a bad
way. What with the straight busk front, the high
heels, the inside shoe elevator, and the drunken
ilt of the millinery, the mode of perambulation
n public is a villainous performance. At Flem-
ngton this year the varying models of progression
were marvellous. The smart girl was all atilt, her
nose vanguarding the rest of her, so to speak.
The Toorak girl lounged lazily or swung her hips
as if nothing mattered so long as she got there.
The impudent dasher had a stride and a short
frock that showed how clean her pace was and
what a foot she had for kicking. The tired girl
with the youthful mama dragged along anyhow,
walking reluctantly in the shadow of her go-ahead
parent. The small mousey girl shuffled with her
toes turned in, and the fat miss bowled herself
along cheerily or heavily. A fine, dashing, cheery,
sensible walk is badly needed in this State. In
Uncle Sam’s Land there are schools for the
Promenade Strut and Colleges of Expert Pedes-
trianism. It’s not a foolish notion in view of the
evils of Walk as practised hereabouts. Walking
should be a joyous, invigorating, healthy exercise,
and Woman, circulating around in an upright
shape, should be ever a picture of delight.
Whenever a Christian Scientist is caught with
an intent, almost pained, expression on her severe
countenance, it is explained that the C.S. is in
the throes of “sciencing another mind.” The
other windy day aboard a bay steamer, one of the
order was sitting in a sort of yellow agony. Her
face wore the aspect of a Gorgon, and her
“mental control” of another sea-sick weakling
left her expression quite terrible. Soon she had
to leave her efforts at sciencing and rush to the
side of the vessel, overcome by the common
marine ailment. Hale and hearty pagans looked
on with a wider smile than ever for tne cult that
couldn’t hold out against a choppy sea.
Dame Northcote has a horror of scribes. Musi-
cians she takes readily into her confidence, but
the journalist is her pet horror. When she wit-
tingly sights one, her smile spreads to a cordial
width, but should the ink person pause to speak,
the Ex. purses up her mouth and just looks
things.
’Phone rings to the Federalists convey invites to
tiffin every now and then from the greater Exes.
These are so impromptu, so free and easy, so
wholly surprising that several of the bidden have
gone to great trouble to ascertain if the message
is bona-fide, and not a trick of some idle chappie.
Arrived at the V.R. quarters, the Federalist finds
another stray member or two haphazardly col-
lected for a mid-day munch with the G.G. Things
proceed cheerfully, and everyone talks out of
turn, or in turn, and the meal ends without a
toast or a speech.
The crest craze has many droll forms. One of
the funniest is the soap crest. In a leading
hostelry a johnnie asked a she fellow-lodger to
accept some of his extra special soap. The miss
expressed her delight. The gift arrived with a
strong violet odor, and the johnnie’s family crest
for ornamentation. She intends to get the curi-
osity framed.
Chiffon-merchant Butler hurtled forward in the
front guard as soon as a Fitz Gibbon memorial was
mooted. He has developed a strong taste for
chairing In Memoriam meetings and presentation
tablet or oil portrait conferences. Being large
and lusty, as well as rich, the drapery-king easily
gets a hearing and the chair. It’s little use being
large or lusty without being rich. It availeth a
hustler nothing to roar elegies or litanies of
approval if he has not the fat cheque to bade his
praise with.
Miss Wrixon, daughter of the State Leg.
Council President, has been doing a round of the
asylums and creches with a basket on her arm and
a heart full of Samaritanism. The only she-chick
of the Wrixons, early in life smoothed back her
locks and left a brow marked with every virtuous
bump in the Saints’ calendar exposed to the
breezes. It is a singularly pious brow, and the
fringe coquetries of other feminines are sadly
shown up when in its proximity. Year in and
year out the young Miss toils for the needy
and wears strangely dowdy clothes on her
ministering angel’s mission. Dame Wrixon
keeps in touch with the fashions and the
Cloth, but never lets her interest in one overlap
the other. The chick is never interfered with.
She goes her own way, absents herself from the
giddy round and puts in all her time polishing up
her halo.
At the departure of Sweet Nell Stewart a cluster
of Gallery girls circled about the grey garbed star
and threw rose-petals and hand-kisses at her moth-
like person. Sweet Nell looked rather pathetic,
and when one old worshipper with a burst of tears
rushed forward for a hug, the Stewart eyes shed
their brine too.
The Colonel Burstons are burdened with a har-
vest of congratulations over the matrimonial book-
ing of their fresh March chick to Dr. Douglas
Cooke, a travelled and go-ahead young sawbones.
Miss Elsie Burston is an excellent type of the
kind of girl this neighborhood turns out off the
seminary ice every now and again. She is as fresh
as a rose, neat as any taut and trim clipper, and
tasty as a French miss. This is only her second
season, and there have been dozens of unheeded
scalps at her trim feet. Flutterers hereabouts are
beginning to think it’s better to be born pretty
than rich.
The Dowager has been treating the Genteel
Poverty societies, the newsrunners, the political
leaguers and a gross of social casuals, at Cliveden,
as a final act of grace for 1905. In a few weeks,
the widow, who is as an institution in the Bent
State, will be lolling on a deck-chair and guarding
her careful astrakhan fringe against the breezes
of the Great Australian Bight.
Preparations are under way for the marriage of
Miss Oliver and Mr. S. Murray. Large, florid,
gay preparations ! The lady will swagger to the
altar rails in most gorgeous apparel.
An engagement of some months’ standing is
likely to be upset owing to the bride’s intense
absorption in trousseau affairs. Weeks pass and
Edwin soes nought of Angelina. A rapturous
note with vague allusions to the morning wraps,
the bath-gowns and the pillow-shams, reaches
him reporting progress, or a ’phone message in-
forms him that the dressmakers are bucking up,
and the hats are all being ordered from a real cute
expert in straw-trimmers. And that’s all.
Edwin chews his moustache ends, recalls that
his marriage braces only cost five minutes’
thought and less in the purchase, and fumes and
frets at the girl. But Angelina is deep in her fal-
lals and heeds nought of such impatience. Pre-
sently there’ll be an outburst from an infuriated
young man, and the trousseau will be left on the
hands of an angered girl. Yet that acute
interest in the bridal paraphernalia is common.
For weeks before a harnessing-up the girl friends
of the average bride are excitedly shown the frills
and tuckers, while the young man and his portrait
and talk of him are avoided. That kind of girl
really weds a wardrobe —not a man.
“ On the trail of the Talbot ” is the summer cry.
The shutters at Stonington were lowered last
week, and their Exes, steamed off to Macedon —
the favorite heights for a bush breeze. Half of
Toorak has followed the Talbot trail.
The Banker Urquharts are off with their full
set of boys to the gum country for the entire hot
season.
Rep. W. Kelly last week motored furiously
round the stylish suburbs shedding P.P.C. paste-
boards on the Very Best People as a sign of his
departure. He sets sail for the Cold Country
directly.
The big Melbourne functions will be a loser by
the passing out of White Knight Fitz Gibbon. The
old dandy figure was never missing from any
show, official or social, throughout the festive
year. Two pretty nieces did the merry-go-round
in his company, and never seemed tired of his
eloquence or his perpetual flow of poetry.
Miss Jennie Brenan was the last of the toe-
trainers to give a Xmas demonstration of the
beautiful feet of her flock. The pupils in this in-
stance furnished two studies —one in a capable
theatrical fling, and the other in a highly genteel
ballroom whirl. They were quite distinctive.
The ballet novice displayed a limb as elastic as
india-rubber and a wonderfully-developed self-
supporting toe. The drawing-room miss, on the
other hand—or, rather, foot —has no such capacity.
She is given a graceful stand on both Trilbies, and
a smooth waltzing step. Miss Brenan gained
much applause for her cunning in bringing the
various limbs to their high state of proficiency.
The champion economist of this city had a
thrillful experience a little while ago. He had let
his Toorak house to a satisfactory family. In
making terms he provided for himself so well that
in a generous spirit he threw in the light gratis.
He probably reckoned on early-bed habits and no
illumination of any account. But he reckoned all
wrong. Tales were borne to him of blazes in every
room all through the dream-hours. One night he
lay in wait, and on seeing the light in the
drawing-room long past the beauty-sleep hour,
became infuriated, marched up the garden, and
got into the house by means of his own Yale. He
bounced into the room and collided with the bed-
post, to the shock of a slumbering Ophelia, who
was too flabbergasted and amazed at the sight
of a good-looking robber to raise the alarm.
(Isn’t it like the sex, even in a moment of
midnight horror to consider the bonny eye of
the housebreaker !) The stranger bowed. The
lady was satisfied with his explanation. In
return she described herself as the governess.
That led to a friendly chat. Probably the fair
one didn’t wear crimpers, and sat up in her cot as
elegantly as if she were at rest on one of the best
Chippendale settees. The landlord accordingly
took his departure in a humble and agitated state
of mind, and since then the governess has taken
a friendly ihterest in the gas.
The Malcolm M'Facharns have been figuring as
heavy family estaters in the Cold Country. A
son reached his responsible years with a great
firing of rockets and much mug-presentation on
the part of “the tenantry,” by gad. The birth-
day went on without the hero, but wires were
despatched to him at Oxford, reporting the pro-
gress of the banquet dad had provided. A satis-
factory sort of feast that! The hero cramming
at Oxford on the classics, with mathematics for
stuffing, and. “the tenantry” waxing joyful over
the fatted birthday calf provided by the absentee.
How 1 Malcolm must be spreading himself in the
Motherland with these comings of age and other
estately festivals!
Dame Hutton was reminded of Australia
recently by the presentation of a local Light
Horse Tommy wrought in sterling silver, guaran-
teed not to run or change color in the face of any
enemy. The golden-thatohed dame made a speech
of thanks before a stylish Fog Town corroboree, and
probably wore one of her most coquettish hats
and high-waist girlie sashes for the occasion. She
is the sort that refuses to part with her young
beauty-ways.
It’s the good-looking man who scores with the
local girl. Even a handsome bandmaster who
scrapes a fiddle in a tea-room gets smiles from the
fair scone-nibbler and quite a cheery bob of recog-
nition when she sights him among the palms of
the ball-room anywhere, in or out of the city.
The Hoggies who buy ice-creams and summer-
squashes for their Winnies become infuriated at
the leer of the fiddler, who is tickled at the situa-
tion and the open tribute to his attractions. It
must be excessively aggravating to a rich old
brute who finds the means whereby the girl laps
up the most expensive whipped cream, to find her
sending smiles over his bald pate to a beautiful
organ-grinder.
In the wool district the boys of the local college
raised their cricket bats against their dads, and in
a return attack were badly beaten. The whole of
Camperdown turned out to witness the fray, and
the victorious dads were greeted with applause.
The girls ought now to have a competition with
their mommers. In this State the she-progenitor
is friskier, fresher (by reason of her adopted
pearls and roses), and more of a sport than her
girl 3. Very likely the Miss in each instance gets
ahead of Time just because her frivolous momruer
has such a passion for keeping behind. It’s a
trying thing to see a parent dodging the years and
cheating age of all its hospitable attentions.
It’s a season of cats—picture-cats, card-cats,
and jewel-cats. How the craze started is a
puzzle. No jeweller or manufacturer with any
sense of the fitness of things could have designed
cat-effigies for gifts to a sex that is only alluded
to as a cat in its most viciously scratchful periods,
Cat effigies are likely to be soon thrown out on the
bargain tables, or buried under the premises out
of sight as a dead loss.
The Bowes Kellys held a christening feast and
incidental rejoicings before sailing to the Apple
Isle. The babe executed its star screech at the
Malvern Church before an awed gathering of
admirers. It, was dubbed Yause Bermingham
by a canon, and howled its top C of protest in
vain. Yause Bermingham Bowes Kelly ! Poor
brat!
The Jersey pair have been putting an aristo-
cratic push to the common and garden spade.
They planted a date-palm each in the Tennyson
patch of the local Gardens.
Once more the Northcotes have been seeing the
sick, and expressing great joy at the sight. The
dailies solemnly state the fact in unmistakable
type. And there doesn’t seem one intelligent
member of the great body-guard to murmur
“ Better not ” in the ear of the Excellencies.
The Waxellency gets lengthy leave of absence
to gird the globe. He has been saving up for a
long time in anticipation. Even his smile has
been cut down, and, his buttonhole bouquet re-
trenched some, with the object of an expensive
plunge all in one maddening heap.
The flourish of ads. over the intended trip of
Pansy Milo Montague to Paris and other giddy
centres makes the. footlighfer reflective. Asa
ballet flinger the present Milo looked very little
different from the ; other girls, yet as a model she
turns her loveliness to golden account, and stars
at Rickards’ as a beginning to the music-halls
abroad. It’s worth while attending to the con-
tours for such a chance.
A sort of oblique crow or cock-a-doodle at
Pastor Fitchett is embodied in a pretty little blue
album just placed in my hands, regarding Melba
College a fanciful name for the Presbyterian
establishment. Said album professes to demon-
strate that, “ tried by the impartial test of Mel-
bourne University examinations, the college
occupies a * position' for scholarship far in
advance of any girls’ school in Victoria.”
A portrait group is given of present pupils
from New South Wales, Queensland, South
Australia, Westraliay- Tasmania and Fiji. The
chief ornaments of the school are Madame Melba,
Vida Goldstein, Mrs. Malcolm M'Eacharn, and
Flos Greig, the first lady barrister. This school
also turned out Miss White, one of the two
first medical practitioners, Miss Ellis, the
first lady M.D., Miss Godfrey, one of the
first lady dentists, and Miss Macdonald, M.A.,
who swept the University board in juris-
prudence and political economy. The girls
whose portraits are given are all hearty-looking
as well as bright in intelligence, and there are
three beauties. Which ? Well, no matter. Any-
how, Miss Goldstein is one. Portraits of the lady
teachers show that Greek and Latin, and even
mathematics and anatomy are quite compatible
with grace and beauty.

“G.H.”: I don’t know if the term
“ worship ” applied to the Jay Pays and P.M.’s
is a statutory title. If it is—or equally if it isn’t
—it’s about, time it was abolished. I am not
iconoclast enough to desire to have Gent One
addressing the president of the Supreme Court as
“judge,” “bloke,” or “old hoss,” and in the
case of our judges the term “honor ” has a certain
appropriateness. But “worship”! And to a
J.P. !! Fancy anyone worshipping Pecksniff,
Esq., J.P. ! ! !
The Australian eucalypt gets an advertise-
ment from Israel Zangwill, of “Merely Mary
Ann ” fame, in a recent London Fortnightly.
Zangwill is a strong advocate of the Zionist move-
ment for re-settling the Jewish nation in Pales-
tine. He has lately been touring that country,
and suggests, among other improvements, the
planting of eucalyptus trees to diminish fever.
That was one thing, at any rate, that they didn’t
know down in Judee in the time of Kibroth-
Hattaavah and Ramathaim-Zophim. If only
some specimens of wombat and platypus could be
induced to gambol about a newly gum-treed
Lebanon, the Austral-Hebrew contingent for
Jerusalem would be largely increased.
“ S.S.” : Judge Eagleson, in letting whole-
sale embezzler Welsh, the Vic. railways account-
ant, off with 15 months and an expression of deep
commiseration, seems to have been influenced
almost entirely by prisoner’s respectable appear-
ance. Had prisoner been wearing patched moles
and had a five days’ beard on him, his Honor
would probably have had no compunction about
giving him seven years. As it is, the spick and span
embezzler, whose thievings had been systematic
and deliberate villainies extending over years, gets
what is equal to about 11 months gaol and the
sympathy of the Judge, who told him that he
would be glad to let him walk out of the court if
he could. It is absurd to contend that justice is
blind while Justices have so lively an eye for “a
gentlemanly appearance.” If I were found out I
would hasten to employ the best tailor in town in
my defence, and let the best lawyer go hang.
Bleeds Fitchett has done little but get
into hot water ever since he left Australia and
started to examine the globe. He made a series
of severe remarks about Victorian secular edu-
cation, and brought about him the fireworks of
Bent’s House of Parliament. His last exploit
may cause the Argus to pass him with the
glassy eye of fractured friendship. Fitchett walked
into a church in Westminster (England) and heard
the parson preach the first five minutes of a half-
hour sermon. Fitchett has often preached himself.
Therefore he reckoned he knew what the other
25 minutes of that sermon was going to be. He
rushed off and wrote a column criticism. As
the criticism was in Bleeds’ nastiest and most
Methodist style it got perilously near libel, and
when the parson sent out to the Argus a printed
copy of the sermon he preached and which Bleeds
Fitchett didn’t wait to hear, the Argus fell over
itself last week in its hurry to print the real state
of the case and to disown Fitchett as a responsible
person.
“ L.E.” on an old subject that is always
new :
I wish to enter a protest against the outrageous names
with which too many Australian localities have been
strangled, and I hereby shriek in the wilderness to have
them all torn off. I write from a place once called Hazel
Glen, now changed to Doreen. It’s not a glen, and there
ain’t no hazels, so a change was needed. But why Doreen ?
A name like that would prevent any township developing,
Yarra Flats was changed to Yarra Glen because, although
it isn’t a glen, it seemed a prettier and more aristocratic
name. liinglake causes a lot of trouble. Some say it’s
called after an English author, but the oldest inhabitant
reckons it must be after a black king, but he’s puzzled
about the lake that isn’t there ; “there’s plenty of crab-
holes,” he says. Transplanted names—Perth, Balmoral
Brighton, Seville, Waterloo, &c.—are only blots
on the landscape ; and pretty, silly English names—
Violet Town, Oakvale, Inglewood, Rupertsvale, St.
Leonards—should be wiped out with a hose. It wouldn’t
take a great genius to devise a sensible system of nomen-
clature. For instance, all native names should be
preserved ; they have a distinctive character, and fit into
our verses. Expressive names—Kangaroo Ground Dingo
Flat, Stoney Rises, Diggers’ Rest, Fern Tree Gully, etc.—
should certainly remain. But most names of city streets
demand urgent redress ; and every lane called after a
. royal person, a dook or a governor should be removed
forcibly from the map. George, Pitt, King William
Collins streets, Victoria Parade—we can’t afford these
luxuries ; Kelly Parade, Wilks Alley, Bruce Smith Drain-
even these would be better. In fact, Bruce Smith Drain
would just fit.

The Bulletin has read so much of late
in the Tory press about the evils of the three
party system that it is really converted at last.
It firmly believes now that the three party system
is all that the Arcus says, and it begs to propose
that the Foreign-trade party should drop out and
reduce the number of parties to two. Xne
Foreign-trade crowd, as the only one whic 1
doesn’t believe in its own alleged principles (at
least it never practised them when it was in
power and had the chance, so presumably it
doesn’t believe in them), is obviously the one that
can be best spared. Yes, the three party system
is a fraud sure enough.
The Brisbane importer men, in a vein of
coarse humor, hung out their flags half-mast on
Separation Day, which disappeared as an institu-
tion with the advent of Federation. It was to
mourn the loss of parochialism, they said, which
meant a loosened grip of Kanaka labor and their
' cheap and nasty friend with the tail of the pig on
his head. This is the same crowd which *
quorum of six to meet occasionally, and calls itself
the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce, with a num-
ber of slimy planks which lead to imaginary
avenues where the unrestricted importer may
, flourish. Wherefore the Chamber suggests a large
toad hurrying down a muddy street with his eye
on money ahead.
Yes-No Reid’s contemptuous dismissal of
any prospects the Deakin Government may have at
the coming election should give that affable combi-,
nation pause. Beaming goodwill to all parties is a
policy jwhich stands a mighty poor show on the
hustings. Deakin’s crowd should employ the
recess.in forming a rousing national policy, with a
radical reform of the tariff, a graduated land-tax
and a scheme for the immediate taking over ot
the public debts as its backbone.
“Gunyah ” writes :
You state, in last week’s issue, that the Carmthers
crowd does not supply free leading articles to the U ; W.
press, as do, you say, Plnlp and Co. to the Queensland
papers. Might One Who Knows ask, in the vernaculat,
Who told you so ? Were you the ordinary provincial rag,
vou’d know that free type-written leaders are supplied
regularly by the Pussy-cat party (calling- themselves the
Liberals'), and the attention of the State Labor'.leader was
called a couple of months ago to the way Public Opinion
(of a sort) is manufactured.
Apropos the woes of N.S.W. under Fede-
ration, a large number of people seem to like
woes, and roll up to share them. Last year, the
Ma State had a bigger increase of population than
in any year during the previous 10. in 18.10,
when George Reid was making everybody jolly
and fat, the population only grew 10, cOO ; fast
year, it grew 28,180. Which shows that a great
many more people prefer the woes of Federation
to all the jollity and fatness which G. Reid is
likely to bring them.
Joe Cook, the man who is always against
Australia, pleads that no action should be taken
against Trusts till they have proved by their
actions that they are the destroyers of Australian
industry, and he advises another Rep. not to
commit himself to anything so ridiculous as legis-
lative enactments against what may never take
place.” So Joe Cook probably regards the pro-
vision of means to repel invasion as useless, un-
called for, and wicked, till Australia has been
over-run and plundered. A military and naval
force is also a provision against something that
may never take place. So is a lifeboat, bo is
Joe Cook’s Sunday preaching, for that matter.
“ Anglo-Saxon ” : How would it he to ask
Edward VII. some time when he isn’t busy and a
bird hasn’t just dropped on his head, to arbitrate
on these three disputed points
(1) Do the words “ distant not less than 100 miles from
Sydney ” mean that the Australian capital shall be as
near as po-sible to the 100-mile line, or that it may beany
distance b. -ond the 100-mile line?
(2) Do tl - words “ shall contain an area of not less
than 100 sc are miles ” mean that it must be only 100
square miles, or only 200 square miles, or that it may be
any area above the 100 square miles ? , ,
(3) Are the people of the Commonwealth bound only by
the Constitution, or are they bound also by the agree-
ment, said to have been made between two Premiers,
that the capital should be at “ a reasonable distance from
Sydney ” which agreement wasn’t put in the Oonstitu-
ti'on, wasn’t mentioned to the people, and wasnt e '’ e "
heard of by them till six years after they had accepted
the Constitution?
A more or less sensible clause inserted in
the Federal Electoral Bill at the instance of King
O’Malley was one prohibiting any candidate from
giving donations for three months prior to polling
dav. Considering how rich men buy votes with
subscriptions, and how poor men are harassed tor
all manner of cash aids when they stand tor
Parliament, such a clause has much to recommend
it, though in case of a sudden dissolution, and an
unexpected election immediately after, it might
blot out many candidates. But in addition there
should be a law prohibiting a member from giving
donations, at any time, to any person or institution
in his own electorate, and providing a heavy fine
for any one who asks him for subscriptions or
alms. The blackmailing of members by begging
constituents amounts to a disease these times.
Dio-by Denham, Queensland Minister for
Agriculture, hints at secession over the sugar
excise. Various people in Westralia have men-
tioned it once or twice unless tlieir transcontinental
railway is at once handed over, and foolish old
Trickett, M.L.C., of N.S.W., talks of it because
the N.S.W. patent records have been taken to
Melbourne (which they haven't). If any of these
people are serious the Australian Government had
better set to work and get the military forces in
better order. Secession means civil war, though
the foolish old Tories who are professing to tool
with the loaded gun have no notion of the tact,
and are personally too mild to throw a bun m a
bad spirit; but even civil war is better than a
return to disunion. The Australian Government
ought to mobilise at least two armed men immedi-
ately.
Victorian Chamber of Manufactures has
decided, by a large majority, that the wicked
Socialists are unobjectionable persons in compari-
son with sworn Freetraders, and that any I arm-
revision Government will be a better result ot
next elections than a triumph for George Reid.
In short, the Chamber of Manufactures and the
Employers’ Federation have fallen out on the
subject of George’s Anti-Socialism. Seeing that
all the manufacturers are employers, they might
as well simplify matters by resolving their Chamber
into a Manufacturers’ Protection Association,
which would do its little best to eradicate the
Freetrade element from the Labor party. Local
manufacturers can at least be encouraged to
oppose the illogical Socialism that waves a r lee-
trade banner.
Premier Morgan has again threatened the
Queensland Leg. Council in veiled terms. It
would be wiser to act. Although the session just
closed is a record one for good, solid, Democratic
work the Tory Chamber’s attitude prevented it
being much better. Queensland’s Upper House
like that of N.S.W., is a House of Nominees and
it only requires sufficient new nominees ol the
right kind to secure the passage of a Bill for its
abolition. The other States have immovable
Houses of Property, therefore it is up to Queens-
land and N.S.W. to lead the way m showing that
the Council is a busted superstition, a dead in-
cubus, an old remnant, a fossil, and a mere snag.
In Canada the provinces of New Brunswick, On-
tario Manitoba, British Columbia and P.E. Island
have got rid of the Aged Incubus, and no longer

grade. It is time Australia showed that it also
has a bright idea occasionally.
This from the report of a recent Bet Bet
(Vic.) shire council meeting is interesting, as
showing the unspeakable cheek of the municipal
Bumble :
Councillor Brown said the Act was supposed to be com-
pulsory but not one-half of the shires were paying the
bonus. He could see no great offence in this council s
io-noring the Act. They took no notice of the Health Act
as far as many of its provisions were concerned, and that
surely was more important than the fox bonus. As for
any person putting the law in motion, there was no fejir
of that; if there was, why had it not been done elsewhere .
Bent might fix his angry eye on this Brown person
who sees no harm in not obeying the law. : Vic-
torian councils spend so much time passing resolu-
tions for the guidance of Parliament and giving
good advice to the universe, that they have almost
forgotten the business that they are elected to
attend to.
Victoria at one time
manufactured a large
quantity of stockings for
its population. It had,
in those days, a pro-
tection of 25 per cent, ad
valorem. When the
Federal tariff came along
the importers and their
lobbyists got the rate
fixed at 15 per cent.,
chiefly on the recom-
mendation of the late
Frederick Sargood. At
the same time, to help
on the manufacture of
yarn, otherwise spun
wool, in the Common-
wealth they imposed a
duty of 5 per cent, on it.
Net Protection on stock-
ings 10 per cent. Now
the manufacture of socks
and stockings in Victoria
is too insignificant to be
even mentioned in the
Government Statist’s industrial figures.
The six Australian Agents-General in
London have reported that it is undesirable that
they (the six Agents-General) should be abolished
ami their work done by one High Commissioner.
This is no more than might have been expected ot
the six Agents-General. All the same, if one of
them had a definite assurance of the High Com-
missioner’s job, it is safe to assume that only five
Agents-General would be so dead sure of the
advantages of the present system, while the sixth
one would regard Agents-General as something
akin to a curse.
The Australian Senate made a dead-heat
(115 votes each way) on a proposal by Pearce, of
Westralia, that everv newspaper which publishes
matter calculated “unfairly to prejudice the
e.ectors against a candidate should be compelled
to insert without payment his “ reasonable cor-
rection or explanation,” so the idea was lejected.
Yet it would be an excellent idea with just one
amendment—that the reply must be no more
lengthy than the attack. The struggle on .both
sides to put a withering denunciation into two
lines would be a valuable lesson in brevity.
The gaud mayor of Sydney and a quantity
of prominent citizens —mostly rich and Conserva-
tive-met last week to arrange for a meeting to be
held at Sydney Town Hall to complain of the
“wrongs” done by the Commonwealth to the
poor old Ma State. But though the gaud mayor
talked very long and copious bunkum about the
“wrongs,” he quite forgot to mention what they
were. And the other men who talked bunkum
along with him also forgot. Trickett, M.L.C.,
who recently wrote to the papers giving a list ot
outrages perpetrated on N.S.W., every one of
which only existed in his foolish old imagination,
was there and gabbled about secession, as usual.
While Trickett only talks secession it is all right,
but if he starts to do it, that would be insurrec-
tion, and poor old Trickett wouldn t look well
being shot in his belltopper some summer morning
on Circular Quay.
44 Justice All-round ” writes from Birming-
ham (Eng.): —
Australians having shown such a spirit of selfishness in
regard to Imperial defence, a great change has in conse-
quence come over the working classes of this country
towards Australian policy ; they are determined not to be
taxed for the protection of a colony that is now more
than able to bear its share in the common defence of the
Empire. It is a grave problem, and is bound to con.e to
the front at the next general election. Australia must
bear her share in the cost of defence, as the working
classes of this country are heartily sick of bearing a
burden when the colonists are rich enough to bear it
themselves. It is nothing short of downright meanness
and selfishness on the part of Australians to wish it. If
you at the Antipodes can find a better friend than Eng-
land has been to you, not a hand will be rimed here to
"••'"'ent you.
With which The Bulletin heartily agrees. Aus-
tralia should bear its share of the defence of the
Empire. Obviously its share is to defend Australia.
44 Edyson ” writes :
I’d like to set .George H. Reid, as the head, front, and
much of the bulk of the Foreign-trade party in Australia,
what should prove a congenial task. Let him, in the
interests of the beloved'cause he so early espoused and
so often deserted, trip to Melbourne, and call meetings of
the unemployed ironworkers of that city, men who have
been thrown out of billets by the inrush of manufactured
goods, to which the Federal tariff has opened wide the
door. Let the meetings be held in the old, disused foun-
dries south of the Yarra, where the men plied busy
hammers not so long ago and wdiere mt present sdence.
broods all the summer day. beveial of the tounaiy
buddings are now used as storehouses for imported
articles that were once manufactured within their walls.
Other buildings have disappeared altogether, but Mr.
Reid could hold his meetings on the barren sites, and
teach those unemployed foundry-men how great a boon
and a blessing it is to have our work done tor us by our
distant relations. I shall he content to *
triumph for the Ereetradc cause it G. H. Reid escapes
with his life.
The backet that goes to the well too often
got damaged the other night in the Senate, what
time the Contract Immigrants Bill was under
discussion. Senator Henderson was speaking,
and Fraser inanely interjected with the usual
Tory gag about the Six Hatters. Whereupon
Minister Playford, who knew the dreary thing
must inevitably happen along sooner or later and
was ready for it, handed Henderson a type-
written document. “ Give them the real history
of it,” said he. “It ought to be published in
Hansard. ’ Gould, aghast at the idea, .lumped
up hurriedly and tried to bludgeon it with the
objection that the document could not be read.
The President ruled against Gould, and then,
while the Tories squirmed and squealed like a
pack of wild cats, Henderson read remorselessly
on to the bitter end. So the real history of the
Six Hatters affair was succinctly embodied in
Hansard, where it can be always easily found;
and the stupid Tories, who didn’t know when
they had used a serviceable lie often enough, are
now kicking themselves for causing the facts to be
placed on record.
N.S.W. Premier Carruthers to a S.M.
Herald interviewer, concerning the Federal capi-
tal business : , Ll
A leading Senator informed me that he arid other mem-
bers deliberately voted for Dalgety because they con-
sidered they were selecting the worst possible site. They
did so in order to prevent the building ot the capital m
an v other place outside Melbourne or Sydney. In othei
words the Senator and his colleagues hoped that the
effect of their action would be to keep the h ederal capital
in Melbourne.
This is not tWe first time Carruthers has said some-
thin”' of the sort, and the people have been wait-
ing for him to reveal the names of Senators whom
he alleges deliberately voted to violate the Consti-
tution. . If Carruthers was informed, as alkgcd-
which nobodv need believe-wliat land of N b. W.
“ patriot ” does he call himself when he continues
to shield the men who conspired to rob xs .S. W.
of her rights ” ? And if Carruthers wasn tso in-
formed, but only said he was in order to make out
another “ grievance,” what kind of a slanderous
fabricator does he show himself to be ?
THE NEW RECRUIT.
Kaiser Bill has “welcomed the highly-gi[?]ed
Japanese into the ranks of the Great Powers
The Campbell-Bannerman Government in
Britain has commenced well by declaring flatly
against any further Chow immigration to Africa.
Also the Chinamen now on hand are to go back
when their engagements expire—though, un-
happily, there is sure to be a leakage, and a yellow
sediment will stay behind to be one more woe in a
troubled land.
The A.W.U. general meeting has passed
on for the verdict of the annual conference the
proposal that “No member of Parliament acting
as land agent should be admitted to the councils of
the Labor party.” The resolution has a great
deal to recommend it. A true Labor party should
be composed of men who do useful work of any
kind, but it shouldn’t include the superfluous
middleman in any shape. And the land agent,
looks like a very superfluous middleman, indeed ■
and an actively nefarious one to boot.
Leader-on paper of the Federal Opposition
G. H. Reid, who has been of late as difficult to
entice to Melbourne as W. N. Willis is to Sydney,
got a dressing-down by Sydney Telegraph on
December 16, which almost demanded ,his resigna-
tion. So on Monday Reid made an unexpected
appearance in the House of Reps, and wept a big
glassy tear about the way his State was being
mauled and dragged round by the hair, by an
injurious Hill Sikes of & Commonwealth.
One thing to be said for an A ustralian
capital at"Dalgety is that it would almost cer-
tainly turn a horribly unprofitable N.b.W. rail-
way line into a payable property. Out of 36 non-
paying N.S.W. railways enumerated in last years
report the line which ends at the nowhere of
Coorna is the worst save three. Its loss is about
£35,000 a year on an average. But a 30-mile
extension along one of the easiest routes in
N.S.W. would carry it to the proposed capital,
and the extra business acquired there would pro-
bably turn the dead loss into a payable asset.
The present incubus is 130 miles long, and it is
worth making a 30-miles extension to get rid of
130 miles of blank insolvency.
The insane action of the Senate in origin-
ating—and the just as insane act of the Repre-
sentatives in accepting—the proposal that the
excise difference in favor of white-grown sugar
shall be extinguished on a sliding scale principle
■ took Australia by surprise. The act was a
treason to the Protectionist principle and to
Australian industry, and it was equally a treason
to the White Australia doctrine. The advantage
given to the white product should be permanent,
and the Senators who proposed its abolition on
the sliding scale principle should have their own
salaries obliterated on a scale that doesn’t slide,
but does the thing all in one act.
Joe Cook, in denouncing the Anti-Trust
Bill
Not content to do our own work, to devote ourselves to
the consideration of those great measures affecting our
•population, our standing in relation to the : tates—-indeed,
all these things which it was the primary object of the
Constitution to achieve—we have begun to meddle in
matters which do not concern us, and we have even gone
outside Australia'to do it.
So, in the opinion of this ignorant lay-preacher,
thG preservation of Australian industries ancl the
welfare of Australian workmen are matters which
do not concern the great Freetrade party in the
Australian Legislature. That party is only, there
to devote itself to “those great questions, the
welfare of tlie American and German exporters,
and the placing of the Federal capital where all
its business will go through the books of the Syd-
ney foreign manufacturer’s agents.
A tale of woe :
The flimsiest tarradiddle in all Carruthers’ vaporings
over his Federal “ grievances ” was his appeal about the
Audit Department officers, whom the Australian Govern-
ment wants to turn out in the street. The facts are that,
years ago, the State Audit Department took on some
temporary hands, and, like most temporary hands in the
' N.S.W. service, they managed to hang on to their tran-
sient billets for several years. N.S.W. flatly refused to
make them permanent officers, pleading the law as an
excuse, but w hen the Federal Government took over some
of the Department it was insisted, on behalf of the Ma
State, that these individuals if the Commonwealth em-
ployed them, should he made permanent officers of the
Federal service. This w 7 as refused, on the ground that
there were already several permanent Federal officers
Sr no work to do; it wa/only proposed to emp oy
these men to prevent them losing their work, but, at the
same time, it was only proposed to the,«mae
status as the Ma State gave them. Then Careuthers re
fused to let them be employed at all, and tore out son
more hair.
THE UPPER ’OUSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We were always very busy in the prehistoric days,
Though our morals were perhaps a trifle lax ;
But we had no idle poets howling idiotic lajs,
And you had to keep an edge upon your axe.
Then the old men did the talking while the youngsters
chased around
Catching all the things that helped to pay the rent,
And at first we rather liked to hear the gabble and the
sound
Of the Very Prehistoric Parliament.
We had neither birds nor monkeys in the Vale of Hidden
Stones,
And the old men broke the silence up a lot,
So we loved the howls of “ Order ! ” and the hisses and
the groans,
And the interjections “ Shame ! ” and “ Tommyrot! ”
Then the Hansard people wrote it down on heavy slabs
of rock
(Which we one and all agreed was very smart),
And the competition demons gave the tribe an awful
shock
By reciting long debates they’d learnt by heait.
So the Prehistoric Parliament proceeded on its way,
And the antics of the ancients kept the tribe
In a simmer of amusement, and. we all were very gai
As we heard the croaking curse and toothless gibe,
And the Opposition yelling and the Minister’s reply,
And the shrieks and squeals of “Order!” and of
“Chair!”
Then perhaps a Labor member would get smitten in the
eye
Or the Government would lose a lot of hair.
It was really most diverting while they simply kept to
gas,
But they didn’t— they displayed a want of tact,
For they told the tribe quite roughly it was one collective
ass
When it asked them for an Arbitration Act,
And the Premier rose and chattered as he saw the flashing
knives,
And he warned us of the “ Socialistic trend,”
Of the tribal legislation which endangered all our lives,
And “ he really did not know where it would end.”
Then the chieftain bounded at him with a tomahawk of
flint,
And the House adjourned in haste till after tea ;
All the able-bodied members did a record-breaking sprint,
And we found them sitting huddled in a tree,
Where they perched in glooomy silence—like the parrots
old and bald,
Each as motionless and quiet as a mouse.
And that is why the Legislative Council now is, called,
Bv the relics who survive, “ The Upper House.”

Oldsmobile Standard 7 h.p. Runabout.
The Oldsmobile is America’s most successful motor car.
It is so strongly and perfectly built, so durable and reliable, that it
has successfully accomplished a 3000 mile endurance run in England, a
30 days’ continuous trial trip on the continent and a 3500 mile race across
the United States of America.
It is especially adapted for use in this country because of its con-
struction, economy of operation, mechanical simplicity (repairs cost
practically nothing with intelligent handling) and its ample power.
The Oldsmobile Standard Runabout is really worth twice what it
costs—and is sold at a remarkably low price, because we know how to
produce the highest automobile efficiency at a minimum cost.

Time seems inopportune when he brings a
woman to the turn of life. Life is, or should be,

Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills are taken occasionally
to keep the system toned
and the stomach in proper
working order. Doctors
prescribe them, nurses re-
commend them, and thou-
sands of women who have
successfully and cheerfully
passed through that stage
can testify to the value of
these pills. ‘‘ I have found
your pills to be highly
beneficial for headaches,”
writes Mrs. E. Wilson, 406

Pills as a genuine remedy for all general family
ailments, and also to all women for complaints
peculiar to their sex. You are at liberty to

personal experience to anyone calling on me.”
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills aid in the digestion

cure for biliousness, indigestion, constipation, sick
headache, sallow complexion, liver and kidney
troubles, piles, pimples, boils and blotches, and

SPORTING NOTIONS.
As a swimmer dead champion Kieran was a won-
der. Four other champions built the records which he
wrecked in less than two short years. When he swam
second to Dick Cavill in the 440yds. N.S.W. Championship
in January, 1904, it was the first gleam of the new star on
the swimming horizon. In March of the same year he
commenced his upward rush by winning the Australasian
Half-Mile and Mile Championships. The following are the
six world records held by him at the time of his death,
and the records he wrecked in making his own :
220 yards, 2min. 28 2-5 sec. Lane’s, 2min. 28 3-ssec.
300 „ 3 „ 314-5 „ R. Cavill’s, 3min. 34 3-ssec.
440 „ 5,, 19 ~ R. Cavill’s, smin. 261-ssec.
500 „ 6 „ 10 3-5 ~ J. Nuttall’s, 6min. 24 l-ssec.
880 „ 11 „ 113-5 ~ R. Cavill’s, llmin. 50 2-ssec,
1 mile 23 ~ 16 4-5 ~ G. Read’s, 24min. 52 3-ssec.
Figures like these make words superfluous !
* * * *
There’s mild trouble over poor Kieran’s
expenses to Brisbane. It was understood that the
dead swimmer went to the Championships meet-
ing as the representative of the North Sydney Club,
but that club has now repudiated the allegator,
and requested the N.S.W. Association to put its
hand in its pocket. It remarks in conclusion that if
the association won’t, then the club will have to do so
under protest. Wonder if, had Kieran come back with a
few new world records hanging to him, and surrounded
with a halo of splendor, would North Sydney have denied
that he went as its representative ? Guess not!
N.S.W. Amateur Swimming Association has
decided that henceforth all heats in championship events
shall be drawn by the association secretary, instead of
the various clubs ; and has also made up its mind that
“ invitation ” scratch events shall be wiped out, which
means that no athlete can swim in races without paying
entrance fees.
* * * *
The English Swimming Association will, as
soon as a swimmer with a reasonable chance can be dug
out, send him to Australia to battle for the sodden ashes
of the swimming supremacy which Kieran brought away.
* • * *
A Queenslander writes: —“There has been a
gruesome exchange between N.S.W. and Queensland in
which the long ghostly arm of coincidence obtruded
itself weirdly. Athlete Spragg, of Bananaland, ate grapes
in Sydney, drank iced concoctions, and went under to
appendicitis. Swimmer Kieran, of N.S.W., ate cherries
in Brisbane, drank iced concoctions, and appendicitis left
another blank. This sort of thing is a lamentable swap-
ping of corpses.”
* * * *
N.S.W.-Victoria cricket match started in Mel-
bourne in the most perfect weather imaginable on Satur-
day afternoon. A cloud screen and a gentle southerly
breeze tempered the heat of the sun to the thirsty Corn-
stalk fielders, for the Victorians won the toss and sent
Warne and Christian to the wickets. Notwithstanding
the perfect environment, and the fact that each State has
now 37 wins to its credit, the public displayed very
languid interest. The only Noble was in charge of the
Cornstalks and displayed curious judgment in his man-
aging of the bowling. While only six runs were made
off Garnsey’s bowling, 21 were knocked off Cotter,
one over alone yielding 13. Then Noble took Garnsey
off and tried his own fatal hand. The result
was electrical, 26 runs being scored off the three
overs sent down by the Cornstalk captain, who then
took himself off and let O’Connor loose. In the mean-
while, Grounds had relieved Cotter, and the rate of
scoring slowed down somewhat. At the end of the first
hour 102 showed on the board, and Noble rang more
changes on the bowling ; but the scoring went on, and by
lunch time was 133. Christian was the first to go. After
lifting both Cotter and Redgrave to the boundary, he was
caught behind by Carter off Redgrave, and a most
dangerous partnership dissolved. Warne’s end did not
come till he had been at the wickets 3hrs. 56min., and
then he was caught at cover-point by. Macartney off
Garnsey, having scored 115, of which 64 were made
by hits for four. McAlister and Armstrong made a deter-
mined stand, piling up 83 before they were caught, and
the drawing of the stumps saw 345 scored for the loss of
six wickets. Tuesday brought cooler w.ather, but the
Victorian tail fell right down, and the brilliant start
emphasised the miserable finish, the four remaining
wickets bringing only 22 runs. As this issue goes to
press, word comes that N.S.W. has made 35 without the
loss of a wicket.
» * * *
The hard luck of A. Christian in the N.8.W.-
Vic..cricket match on Saturday was enough to drive to
drink every batsman of a sympathetic disposition. It
was Christian’s first Sheffield Shield match, and he just
failed by two runs to score his century, falling a victim
to Carter, who was behind the sticks.
.** * *
“Adelaide”: S.A. cricket XI. for Mel-
bourne and Sydney (Clem Hill will not play) has
caused a shock to some Adelaide critics. Three
of the experiments tried on the Oval last week
against N.S.W. have been dropped promptly, including
Roy Hill and P. Hutton ; the latter’s wicket-keeping was
even poorer than shown against Victoria by Newland
(when just off the voyage and not fit to play). The new
keeper is H. S. Jarvis, son of “ Affie ” J., who was second
only to Blackham in all Australia any time from 1880 to
1895. Most people thought that Gehrs would retain the
gloves ; he did fine work last week after Hutton was
hurt, also London critics strongly urged him to take up
that department if he wants to see England again. The
schoolboy Dolling is at last given a chance to play for his
State, the veteran Reedman comes back into the team
(but it seems doubtful if he can get away), and the other
veteran, Travers, who was playing in a test-match less
than two years back, has been re-admitted. S.A. is trying
hard to find some new bowlers. The awful collapse of
her batsmen when Garnsey skittled them all out after
tea, the other evening, is attributed to the fact that they
had been fielding all day with the thermometer at 103 in
the shade and 152 out on the grass.
* * * *
Ivor Lawson and MacFarland hurried West to
arrive in the gold State in time to be thoroughly fit to
put up a huge struggle for the Westral Wheel Race,
which is worth £3OO. This is the race that did most to
line MacFarland’s pocket last year, and the appearances
indicate that the western plum will go into the American
bag again this season, and thereby bring much joy to the
soul of Sydney Telegraph, which wailed bitterly recently
because an Australian won the Austral.
* * * *
S. S. Levey, who got disqualified in the Austral
final, was unfortunate. Entering the straight he was two
lengths in front, and, although Sandberg came with a
very fine rush, it is more than doubtful if he could have
passed Levey, who was travelling at a great pace. Levey’s
explanation was that he was “all out,” and, riding with
his head down, unconscious of everything except the
whirling of his pedals, and balancing by the reflex action
of his brain only. He had no knowledge of having
swayed, and, if he did it, it was done unconsciously.
Anyhow, the chances are that he would not have done it
so glaringly had it been done on purpose, for everybody
saw the interference, and had Sandberg not protested
the stewards would have taken action on their own initi-
ative. It would have been much better for Levey to be
second, with £lOO in his pocket, than first and dis-
qualified. As it is he gets nothing.
The Victorian League committee dismissed
Levey’s appeal against disqualification in the Austral
final, and that enterprising St. Kildan has announced his
intention of taking legal action to “ regain his rights.”
Presumably the “rights” are the 500 sovereigns, and
Victoria is apparently in for the same sort of public
washing of racing reputations that N.S.W. had over the
1904 Sydney Thousand.

“ 0.K.” : The final for the Austral at Melbourne
Exhibition Oval was to me a most unsatisfactory show of
its kind. Arriving on the scene a few minutes before the
race, I found myself quite in the dark as to the names
and handicaps of the 12 starters. The respective numbers
of the men were strung together in lines on a crude
starting-board, but even if one succeeded in unravelling
the mystery of the numbers, there wasn’t time for a late
comer to discover the identities of the cyclists they repre-
sented by wading through the back pages of the official
programme and sorting them out from the lists
of preceding heats. However, it was easily dis-
covered that the man on the back mark was
one Sandberg, and that Sandberg was a strong
tip. This being the case, I expected the front-mark
men to make the best possible use of their chance to
beat the favorite by going off at a good bat when the
pistol was fired. Instead of making a strong pace they
allowed the field to get bunched with them after going
one lap or so. Sandberg:, who should have been given
a long stern-chase, was right up amongst them in this
early stage of the proceedings. Then, for a time, the
field travelled in fairly close order, as though bent on
making a slow race of it. An electric-lighted track at
10.30 on a dark night is not favorable to keen observation
of a bicycle struggle. It was hard to say how the men
were shaping, and from the Grand Stand, which is on the
side of the (ival furthest away from the winning line, one
got a very uncertain notion of the final struggle. To me it
appeared that Sandberg and Megson were fairly out-
paced at the finish by somebody who turned out to be
Levey. Levey lost ground bv swerving outwards ; never-
theless he got home a full wheel in front of Sandberg,
who had swerved with him. When favorite Sandberg
was awarded the race on a protest I wondered how the
luckless outsider would have fared if he had been in the
other man’s place.
* * *
When cyclist Dick Arnst goes to the front of the
field a shiver runs through the riders who trail his
wheel, and the position is mighty unpopular, for the burly
Dick is almost as great a faller as Lord Brassey. No
matter whether it is on the track or the road, Richard
comes his cropper, and whether it is the area of him, or
what, for some reason he always gets badly cut up. He
fell in his heat of the Austral, and when he turned up at
the track the morning after he was mostly dressed in
bandages. Apparently the big fellow rides too small a
machine, and it would pay him to hump more weight and
have a machine suitable for his build. As it is he is top-
heavy.
* * * *
There are some wonderful sporting writers in
Sydney, and some of them have discovered that the thing
required to make cycle-racing popular is to have plenty
of mile spins. The reason that the Austral preliminary
heats failed to attract the public is ascribed to the popular
dislike for anything over mile races, and the Austral was
a two-mile run. This sudden discovery of the popularity
of the mile race is amusing—hilarious, in fact, in the light
of the recent Summer Nights meeting at Sydney' Cricket
Ground, when some of the finest mile spins ever run were
made by Pye, Farley and MacFarland in front of a
naked “ hill,” desolate pavilions, and vacant dead-head
stands. When even the dead-head declines to spend
trani fares to see first-class mile races, either the public
wants longer races or no races at all. But in all human
probability even the Melbourne Cup would prove a howl-
ing, unmitigated frost if it were run off in 24 preliminary
heats and six “semi-finals,” the whole concluding
with a brazenly “ cronk ” finish —the culprits being
whitewashed in time to get properly going next season.
The truth of the matter seems to be that cycling is ceasing
to be numbered among the things that charm the man
with a spare half-crown in his pocket ; and, considering
the characters and doings of some of the men whom the
authorities allow to race, it is small wonder.

The hideous roads between Melbourne and Syd-
ney have caused the Dunlop Rubber Company to consider
the advisability of selecting some other route for the next
Motor Reliability Test. , From Melbourne to Adelaide
(which will be another awful injustice to N.S.W., and
probably lead to the execution of manager Sherwood by
Joey Carruthers) has been proposed, but although of the
1168 miles only 150 are really bad, that patch contains
the Coorong Desert, a 92-mile stretch of unmade sand
track, which is too awful to contemplate. So, in all
human probability the next Reliability Test will be held
over the roads of the Western District of Victoria.

This paper begins to have doubts as to whether
that motor race meeting on Aspendale track will ever
eventuate. Postponed from Cup Day to Boxing Day, it
has been again shifted further along to January 29th. In
N.S.W. it has been decided to hold the Reliability Race
for motor boats from Sydney to Newcastle in March.
* * * *
Already motor cars are beginning to show signs
of becoming a drug in the market. A good, reliable car,
which had gone through had some six months’ use in
the streets of Sydney, and originally cost £350, was last
week sold to the highest bidder for £5O.

Henri Mayer had a sensational fall the first
time he appeared on Sydney Cricket Ground track, where
he struck his pacing motor while training, and came
down on his head and shoulders. How he escaped death
no one knows, but when a doctor got to work on him he
found that he was only suffering from slight concussion
and a bruised bone in the shoulder. Still this unfortunate
smash may exclude him from the Sydney Thousand ; he
will probably recover long before then, but it is doubtful
if he will have time to get fit after he has recovered.

If this country really desires to know what an
ill-mannered, fractious, uncouth beast the horse can be
when he arches his back like that of a cat in love, and
lays himself out steadfastly to destroy his Australian
admirer, it should go to Martini’s buck-jumping show, at
Christchurch school-grounds, Sydney. At the same place,
the Australian can see how his aboriginal can sit on any-
thing that keeps the side for sitting on uppermost ; what
will happen when the horse turns right over is problema-
tical. By the look of things, it won’t be the abo. that
will be hurt.

A microscopic crowd turned up at Randwick
(Sydney) for the first day of the A. J.C. December meet-
ing. The weather was a trifle warm, but delightfully cool
and pleasant compared to that of the same meeting
the previous year, when the sun glared through
a coppery-tinted haze, and it was understood
that the bulk of New South Wales was going up
in smoke and flame. Saturday last found the people in
a languid mood ; little betting was done, but what there
was was in favor of Ikey Noses. For the opening race,
the Trial Handicap, 11 came out, and the public pinned its
faith to Steel Trust and Levee, against which Noses laid 3 to
1. The Trust had the advantage of being managed by jockey
Barden, and although challenged by Calala at half way,
won “ comfortably.” The Flying Handicap brought out
16, and Marengo, the six-year-old, against whom the
books laid 7 to 2, came with a rush in the
straight, and won by a length and a half in
lmin. 13fsec., which was 3|sec. better than last
year’s time. Antonious, the son of Sir Foote, backed down
to 3’s, was about the last to start in the Nursery Handicap,
and, catching Lady Evelyn, who had made the pace
fast from the start, about 50yds. from home, he sailed past
and beat her by three lengths, in lmin. 2sec. —4sec. better
than Mutation’s time for the race last year. Judging by
the ease with which Marvel Loch won the Grand Stand
Stakes, the chestnut daughter of Lochiel is in great form.
At the turn for home she ran away from Royal Arthur,
and finished three lengths from Elvo. This time was also
an improvement on last year’s, being lmin. 54Jsec., as
compared to lmin. 55Jsec. made by Nothos. The Holi-
day Handicap saw Steel Trust, against whom the odds
were 14 to 1, score his second win for the day. Not till
they were all in the straight did the Trust come, just as
Trusts generally do, and cut down opposition with one
fell rush. Nothing else had a chance. Time was 2min.
9jsec.—Jsec. slower than Green Mountain’s time last year.
In High-weight ’Cap, J. E. O’Brien’s Neirbo led the field
from the very start, till Coraki, at the Leger stand, came
up close and the exhausted Neirbo fell back into second
place, Coraki finishing first by three-quarters of a length,
in lmin. 41sec.—2§sec. better than Birida’s time last year.

The V.R.C. New Year’s Day meeting will prob-
ably give the public a liberal supply of gees, though the
number of triers may be limited. In the Standish Handi-
cap, the top-weights look dangerous, also Troytown, if
that disappointing animal is capable of winning any sort
of race just now. In the Bagot, one of Scobie’s or The
Infanta may do the trick. Not many horses are earnestly
backed on the first of January at Flemington, nevertheless
it isn’t a good day for favorites, as a rule. Last year the
favorite got beaten in every race, and if there was any
punter present who tried to win a “ certain £lO ” by
following “ the system,” he must have dropped about £5O
on the day. A system that starts a Glad New Year with a
loss of £5O is hardly worth the incidental worry.

Both Christchurch (M.L.) stipendiary magis-
trates have definitely announced that they will in future
gaol Ikey Moses and his fellow-layers who “trespass” on
racecourses, whether they are first offenders or not. Ikey
is a howling nuisance to clubs, who have to employ
private ’tecs to order him off when they see him stealthily
plying his calling in opposition to the tote. Abnormal
fines don’t deter Isaac, but perhaps gaol without the
option will. Anyway the experiment is to be tried. It
should have been tried long ago.

“ Homo ” : A woman who lives alongside a
pawnshop, close to Wren’s Collingwood(Vic.) tote, assures
me that she has known men to undress in the right-of-
way, so as to put their shirts and waistcoats “ up the
spout ” and back the dead bird with the proceeds.
According to recent measurements the tallest
dog in the world is a St. Bernard, owned by a resident of
Marrickville (N.S.W.). The dog stands 36£ inches at the

The limit of protracted absurdity in champion-
ship contests was reached in the wrestling match between
Clarence Weber and Buttan Singh t’other Monday night.
On a previous occasion, in the same Melbourne circus-
building, the same antagonists had given a lively show of
its kind, but even then Weber’s little bit of combativeness
seemed to desert him as soon as he found that he wasn’t
getting things all his own way. The other night he pur-
sued a policy of mild aggression at intervals during the
first hour and a half, these intervals growing rarer as
time dragged on. Buttan, who was not expected to do
more than defend his championship title against the
younger, heavier and stronger man, contented himself for
the most part with standing at arm-holds whilst Weber
was trying to make up his mind to do something. When,
occasionally, the Hindu was forced into a kneeling posture
on the mat, he never appeared in much danger of defeat.
The efforts to overturn him were not long sustained,
and after a while the uninteresting combatants be-
came too wet with perspiration for either of
them to get a very tenacious hold of the
other. Then Buttan took a turn at aggression, and a
short bout of rough-and-tumble wrestling showed that
one or other of them must have been satisfactorily
downed if they hadn’t both been afraid of taking risks.
They took no further risks. Two hours and a half after
the start their perspiration passed away into atmosphere
and they were as dry as the onlookers. Incidentally a young
man walked into the arena with a white boxer and a black
one in attendance, just to mention that this other pair
of professional gladiators would put up a fight on the
following Monday. Meanwhile the “ wrestlers ” stood at
arms’ length as usual, and the tired referee counted the
minutes to 11.30. When the pubs, were closing the
patient boss of the ceremonies thought it a fair thing to
declare the match a draw. It lasted three hours, and it
has probably sufficed to bring expert catch-as-catch-can
wrestling into utter contempt for the next three years.
Should a more spirited white man than Weber venture to
tackle the tricky Buttan the public will refuse to take any
interest in the affair.
“Snell” : As a white Australian I was sadly
disappointed with the showing of Clarence Weber against
the coolie champion Buttan Singh, at Melbourne, for the
catch-as-cats-can glories and a fair lump of money.
Weber had youth, strength, and a tremendous advantage
in size and weight, and had everything to gain. It was
up to him to wade in and make the “ rastle ” hum, but
after the first 20 minutes or so the belauded Adonis —who
has had much more press applause than is good for him—
decided to cease hustling in the interests of an
unspotted continent, and then slowly the long night
wore on. A duller sight than that afforded by the
subsequent efforts of the competition to refrain
from doing anything till half-past eleven should
arrive, I have never been afflicted with, and I blame
“ Olarry ” Weber for my protracted weariness. “ Clarry,”
despite all the nice things said of him, strikes me as being
too much of a mammy’s boy to bump big, ugly, tough
men about this world’s crust with any particular advan-
tage to himself. B. Singh, who is a veteran, had only t 6
hold what he possessed, and he held it with a great
Asiatic calm. Weber was out to win the championship
and cover himself with glory, but he had neither the
savee nor the audacity to put up a vivacious scrum for
the sequins and the pride of victory. The white Aus-
tralian championship remains with a coffee-colored person
with hind legs like a baked turkey.

The Maoriland footballers are not having the
walk-over they anticipated in Wales ; from 55 and 40 to
nil their scores have dropped to 0 to 3, 9 to 0, and 6 to 3
in the last three matches. The slump has moved the ex-
Maorilander who runs the football column of Sydney
Telegraph to rake the English papers for extracts on the
trickiness and unfairness of the Welsh footballers.
Which is a hideous exhibition for any great newspaper to
make of itself. Nobody could play a trickier game than
this same crowd of Maorilanders, if the same English
papers are to be believed, and in the match in which they
were beaten their forward passing was so painfully fre-
quent as to be specially mentioned in the cables. Anyhow',
if the Telegraph wants to get stirring denunciation of
the tactics of the Maorilanders all he has to do is to rake
the little provincial papers of Seddonia and note the
remarks of the journals published in the towns whose
representatives have just been thoroughly walloped by
the “pointing, brutal bashers”—as they were once
described —from the next district. Then he will know all
about his countrymen.

“C.C.”: The Yorks and Lancashire (Eng.)
footers must be itching for a willing tro with the vic-
torious Maoris, but being semi-professionals they are
tabooed by the dignified Rugby Union. A few years ago
Lancashire and Yorks Rugby players, who are mostly
working men, secured a system of payment for “broken
time.” They couldn’t afford to lose a day’s, or even half
a day’s, wage per week. The Rugby Union connived at
it for a while, but it spread too much, and, may be, deve-
loped into something beyond payment for broken time.
So the Union squelched the system. But the men of the
Roses wouldn’t be torn off their little perks, and the dis-
pute ended in the secession of the crack Yorks and
Lancashire Clubs from the Rugby Union, and the forma-
tion of the Northern Union, which takes its football as
seriously as the Maorilanders, and plays the game for all
it is worth. The Maori team, being under the auspices of
the Rugby Union, will not be permitted to play the
“Northern Savages.” In the old days, at least half of
the international team came from the two Northern
counties.
* * * *
According to all accounts, the M.L. football
men in England run the risk of being dubbed the
“ Maoriland Misers ”. Expenses are cut down to bedrock,
in order to bring back a sackful of coin. The men often
walk miles to matches instead of driving, and they travel
third on the railway. Well, the walking should serve to
keep them in good condition ; and the reason they travel
third-class is probably because there’s no fourth. They
are said, by the way, to be all Prohibitionists, and even
in a country where beer is so cheap as it is in England
that saves something’. You can spend 2d. very suddenly
on beer in England.
* * • •
It didn’t take the Maoriland footballers very
long to conform to British ideas ; and when they were told
that it “ wasn’t the custom ” to be preceded to the field
with a gorgeous banner suggestive of a declaration of war
rather than football, the Maorilanders meekly packed the
huge black and silver emblem back to Seddon Land. Per-
haps it was as well. The banner might have been the last
straw, and it is just as well for a team not to attempt to
fight thousands when away from home.

Evidently bluff King Ned is not what he used
to be, as it is announced lhat he has gone back to cro-
quet. For the benefit of the younger generation it may
be explained that croquet is a game in which a wooden
ball is knocked by a mallet through an iron hoop. Writer
forgets how the points are counted, but Noah would
remember if he wasn’t dead. The only point about the
game was the fact that if a woman had a pretty ankle,
steadying the ball with her foot gave an excellent
chance to display it; but when one has paid for the
silk-specked hose for a few years he ceases to take an
interest in that sort of frippery. And King Ned has paid
for an awful lot of hose.

The Duffey rumpus gets more mixed every day.
Duffey now disclaims all responsibility for the article
which appeared under his name, and alleges it was
Written by the editor of the magazine and published
without being submitted to him, Duffey. Meanwhile the
editor of the magazine has disappeared, and Duffey’s
protests are being unheeded by the amateur authorities,
who go on expunging his name from their records.
Even his own University has gone dog on him, and
returned to the English a handsome cup which Duffey
won for it from the played-out Briton across the water.
Duffey denies that he ever wrote, or authorised anyone
to write on his behalf, that he had been a professional
since 1898, and declares that what he really did say was
that the star amateur receives such liberal expenses that
there is really no difference between him and the profes-
sional. Which is quite true, excepting the fact that the
professional is a lot less of a hypocrite. Duffey also invites
anyone who thinks he has broken the law' to commence
an action against him, and has announced that he will
take steps to compel the amateur bodies to re-insert his
records in their books. Duffey now finds himself in a
tight place. The only way he can really start to clear
himself is to prosecute his friend, the editor, for having
stuck his name to an article which he did not write, and
the chances are that, if he does, he will lose his billet; and
now he has lost his status and all his records, he can
hardly afford to lose his billet too ; it’s about all he has
left.
One of the most interesting and original com-
petitions yet introduced to the public in Australasia, is
that just devised by the Dunlop Rubber Co., which is
offering prizes of £35, £lO and £5 to the successful con-
testants in the following competition. Artistic booklets
can be had gratis containing prints of 20 illustrated
advertising designs. The public are asked to place them
in their order of merit from an advertising point of view,
and the first selection sent in similar, or nearest
approaching, to a sealed list lodged by the
Dunlop Company in the hands of its bankers will be
the winner. As a means of testing the public taste in
the matter of pictorial advertising, the competition will
be a most interesting one, and will be sure to be popular
with all classes of the community. Full particulars of
the competition, which is free to all, in addition to an in-
teresting article on “ Rubber and Its Uses,” are contained
in the attractive 28-page booklet, which any of the Dunlop
Co.’s depots will be pleased to post you on receipt of
your name and address.*

N.S.W. Amateur Athletic Association has
placed on the book the records put up at the champion-
ship gathering—Nigel Barker, 440yds. in 48£sec. ; 6. A.
Wheatley, one mile in 4min. 23sec. (both are Australasian
best), and L. F. Pomeroy’s three mile walk in 22min.
22 2-ssec. There are signs that amateur athletics are on
the up-grade in N.S.W., and applications for re-instate-
ment are pouring in at a rate sufficient to give the sport
a much-needed stimulant.

Saturday saw the commencement of the inter-
state Sailing Carnival at Brisbane (Q.), when the 10 and 14
footers each held a handicap. In the 10ft. race all
five competitors were Queenslanders, and the race was won
by the Irex. In the 14-footer contest N.S.W. skippers
never had a hope, apparently through being in strange
water. There were 10 starters, and the Queenslahd
boats Yiolet 11. and Rose finished first and second respect-
ively. The third and fourth places were filled by two
Walers, Air Motor and Esperanza. In spite of the alleged
handicap of strange waters, Air Motor, which made a
shocking start, sailed splendidly and pulled up lost time
in a remarkable manner.


“ Squidge”: Found myself by some means
in Janet Mrs. Clarke’s ballroom last week. There
was a large horde of women, and Bruce Mr. Smith
stood up and “ praught ”to them. His preaching
was just the sort of unctuous twaddle anyone who
knows Spruce Mr. Myth would expect from him.
He posed as the only genuine political oracle.
“ I am regarded,” he declared, as he blew Ins
waistcoat well out, “as the most formidable
champion of Japan.” How the women perked up
and applauded. If Bruce Mr. Smith wants to
make a really good splash among his women
disciples, he’ll borrow the brown tin toggery that
Julius Mr. Knight wore in “The Darling of the
Gods.” How lovely he would look ! That coal-
black moustache, under the carefully-groomed
grey locks, as it peered out of Kara’s flower-pot
lielmet, would bring him more converts in an
hour than his twaddle would make in a century.
The proprietors of that well-known food, Plas-

sented by the company.*
The first duty of man is to keep his teeth good,
and to be good they must be clean. As far as the teeth
are concerned, cleanliness goes far before godliness, and
to achieve this object some of the brightest intellects of
the chemical profession have tried their skill at inventing
dentrifices. The first object was to invent a cleansing
agent that would not be injurious, and it was found that
in the majority of cases the substance which cleaned
teeth also destroyed them. One after another the vast
array of liquids, pastes and powders have gone into
oblivion, but as a rule each one that came on the
scene was an improvement on the one that had gone
before. The latest arrival is Odol, a liquid preparation
of hygienic, antiseptic ingredients which are known to
be most potent in maintaining the teeth in a natural,
vigorous and healthy condition. Being a liquid, it very
easily penetrates to all parts of the teeth, and so potent
is its action that it will n it only keep teeth sound, but
arrest decay where it has already set in. If you want to
live long in the land, and enjoy the shekels you accumu-
lated in the days of your youth, keep your teeth sound
by using Odol. For bad teeth mean indigestion, and
indigestion is worse than the worm that dieth not, and
makes even the most fortunate of millionaires more
miserable than his own dog.*

A casual Australian of another sort trans-
pired the other day in the shape of a Melbourne
man, who explained to a suburban bench that he
had been a “casual” employee on the railways
for 20 years.
A Melbourne dentist got a bad advertise-
ment the other afternoon. At first some little
curiosity was excited by sounds of bellowing and
banging that poured forth from the depths of the
fang foundry, and people in the street loitered to
listen to the expressions of resentment and the
crash of mirrors. Suddenly a young man of bushy
aspect hurled himself out of the establishment
into their midst, revolving round himself as it
were, and behaving with the hysteria and lack of
method peculiar to a dog that has a cracker
attached to his tail. He had a large dental instru-
ment hanging out of his face, and he was followed
by the operator, whose nose was bleeding all down
the front of his garments. The dentist seized on
his instrument and towed the distracted bushman
back into the torture chamber by the mouth,
leaving the crowd to feed its curiosity with specu-
lations. This vaguely reminds the writer of a
time when he lived alongside a dentist, and
couldn’t do his work for the shrieks of the patients
who were having their teeth extracted without
pain.
“L.S.D.”: There was much controversy
a while back re aboriginal marriage laws, and it
set me wondering whom allegedly Christian people
may not marry. After studying the family next
door, I have come to the conclusion that they
may marry almost anybody. Concerning that
family next door. The head of it, Johnson,
married a person named Smith, who died, leaving
four descendants. The widower took his loss
philosophically, and married the widow Jones,
who brought with her two daughters—Jane and
“ Hemma.” Jane married Ferguson and lived
next door. The new Mrs. Johnson had six more
children, and then she also died. Then the
widower married ‘ ‘ Hemma, ” his second wife’s
second daughter by her first husband and the
sister-in-law of Ferguson next door. She also
increased the population. After that Johnson
died, old and full of matrimonial experiments,
and was buried with great applause on his tomb-
stone. Almost at the same time Jane Ferguson
next door died, and after a brief interval Ferguson
married his wife’s widowed sister “Hemma,” the
relict of Johnson. And the relationships of the
families of all these people are past human know-
ledge, and couldn’t be traced without a blood-
hound.
“ San Remo’s ” narrative :
Some years ago in Rockhampton (Q.)a would-be suicide
walked casually into a barber’s shop, picked up a razor
and proceeded to spill the contents of his jugular all over
the j.)la< e. Event was the talk of the town for some days.
It kind of crippled the barbering trade. Folks who were
being shaved were kept on the jump, for silly barbers
would keep on talking about the affair, and waving the
razor to show how it was done, and gurgling and spilling
red tooth-powder on the floor to fully illustrate the cir-
cumstances. The awful impression got round that Rock-
hampton was full of mad barbers. Then a report arose
that one barber had arisen with a dry howl and tried to
slay a customer in cold lather. Things got so bad that
proprietors called in medical men and had each assistant
certified as being of, etc., etc. It was very soothing to a
nervous customer to see upon his mirror a nicely-
framed certificate, with photo, attached, that the man
shaving wasn’t a dangerous lunatic after all. Well, we
were all getting back to the old, reg’lar shave, when the
practical joker broke out. But he only broke once. He
dived in, hair awry, coat off, collar burst open, grabbed a
razor, and, with a yell, drew it (the back) across his
throat, and then, with a gurgling sound, rolled on the
floor and expired more or less. My man clipped a lump
off my ear, but 1 never noticed it till the clown got off the
floor, with a grin on his fool of a countenance. Then
things began to happen to him. I got home first, letting
him have my shaving pot, water and all, fair in the face.
The barber smote his head with a hair brush. As he
dived out of the door my mate’s boot struck him in the
back, and Mac. fetched him a beauty on the point,
spreading him all along the toepath. Then a policeman
appeared upon the scene, and the irate barber man gave
him in charge for creating a disturbance. There was
peace after that among the hair-cutters of Rockhampton.
Yankee Prohibitionist lecturer J. T. Brown,
now “doing ” Maoriland :
If there is a Hell-hole on earth, it is the Chinese quar-
ter in San Francisco. I say to you people of Maoriland
that if you want to live long and prosper and keep a pure
country, stick to your present immigration laws.
John See, ex-Premier of N.S.W., returned
from a trip to Japan the other day, and unbur-
dened himself to a Townsville (Q.) interviewer :
He had a private audience with the Emperor and
Empress. He also met the Ministers, Premier, and many
distinguished persons, including Kamimura and Togo,
and was entertained at dinner by the former. Referring
to the heat on the homeward journey, it was deadly
oppressive in the extreme north of Australia. He came
to the conclusion that the far north is not fit for white
men engaged in manual labor. He did not wish it to be
inferred that he considered Australia should be opened to
a peaceful invasion from the eastern countries, but he
did think a line of demarcation should be drawn, or a
zone fixed where, under restriction as to numbers,
certain labor from the eastern countries could be utilised
by white men, who are endeavoring to develop this
portion of the territory.
John would have been a lot more convincing had
he “ come to his conclusion ” before he bobbed his
moderately brilliant cranium to the boss Mon-
key, and had dinner with Kamimura. As it is,
people are apt to suspect that John’s sudden
affection for “ certain labor from the eastern
countries ” (by which he presumably means
northern countries) is merely his way of making
some return for Monkey hospitality.
Ft. M. Falconer, a well-known mercantile
representative in Monkeyland, tells a few facts
about Japan—what that country does and what
it doesn’t:—
No land in Japan can be owned by a foreigner, neither
can mines or stock in semi-Government banks or steam-
ship companies. The coast trade is reserved for Japanese
companies, and ships are subsidised and bonuses paid on
those built in Japan. The tobacco industry has been
nationalised, and although 20 cigarettes are sold for 1 jd.,
as good as those at four times the price in Australia, yet
there is an enormous profit. The salt industry is likewise
for the benefit of the people. All raw material required
for manufacturing is duty free, on the importation of
goods which can be made in the country a heavy duty
must be paid. Also, all goods generally used or con-
sumed by foreigners bear a heavy duty. When the silk
trade was in danger through the manipulation and
trickery resorted to by dealers, the Government took the
industry in hand, and by grading and stamping all silk,
has greatly increased the export. And when private
enterprise threatened the matting trade by selling short
length, short weight, short everything matting, the
Government decided to inspect, weigh, and stamp all
mattings, and to prohibit the export of matting not
bearing the Government mark. Think of it, ye butter
dealers ! And now it has come to the knowledge of the
authorities that Sydney and Melbourne agents are making
a practice of selling quality 4 and 5 straw braid as No. L
and so causing Japanese braid to get into disrepute, and
they are going to inspect and label each piece. And no
foreigner remains in the service of the Japanese Govern-
ment when he can be dispensed with.
That last Court of Appeal, the Privy
Council, is not only pretty outspoken, but also
somewhat insulting at times. In dismissing
Hawthorn (Yic.) council’s appeal from the Vic.
Full Court, against an award of £250 damages for
letting its drain overflow on a citizen’s land, the
Lords remarked : “ The case seems to be a very
simple one. As to negligence, it is difficult to
imagine a more conspicuous example of negligence
than is shown by repeatedly pouring offensive
stuff into a channel proved over and over again to
be insufficient to hold it and pass it on. The
municipal authorities might just as well pour
it on the man’s land. It is nothing to the
purpose to say that plaintiff’s property was often
flooded before the municipal authorities turned
the watercourse into a public drain ; nor is it
enough to prove that the work done in 1889 was
sufficient at the time. It is insufficient now. It
is not suggested that there is any real difficulty in
remedying the mischief—the evidence goes to
show that the matter can be set right at very
trifling cost.” Appeal dismissed with contumely
—and costs. These judicial committeemen of
England’s Privy Council may be inherent Tories
and dry-as-dust lawyers ; but they seem to have
fairly up-to-date notions of the duties of municipal
councillors, and the way they speak to aldermen
and sucli-like cattle is refreshing.

For the Convenience of Country Xmas
Visitors.
It is a recognised fact in the spheres of Aus-
tralian medical practice that the Specialists of the
Freeman and Wallace Medical Institutes, Sydney
and Melbourne, who have been in active practice
for 25 years in Australia, have cured more men of
their various troubles than any similar association
of medical practitioners in Australia. It is also
true that had it not been for their system of
parcel-post treatment many men would now have
been in their graves had they not written to and
obtained treatment by this most effective method
of medical correspondence. To men who are resi-
dent in the remote portions of the Australian
Commonwealth upon sheep and cattle stations,
of extensive farms and districts where medical
men are few and far between, this system presents
many valuable methods by which the most
effectual and reliable treatment may be afforded.
All letters addressed to the Specialists at the Insti-
tute, Sydney, are replied to punctually, and ladies
may, if necessary, consult the lady Physician of
the Institute, Dr. Elizabeth White, by writing
privately to her address at the Institute. She is
an expert in the treatment of women and
children’s affections. The Physician-in-Chief of
the Institute, Dr. Richard Wallace, is registered
by Australian, English and American Medical
Boards, and is an expert in the treatment of
Men’s Serious Disorders, and is one of a staff of
Four Legally- Qualified Physicians and Surgeons
always in, attendance. During the Xmas and New
Year season, for the convenience of visitors the
Institute will be open daily from 10 a.m. to
<) p.m., and special appointments may be made if
necessary. A 700-page Medical work will also be
given away to anyone who calls.*

The Poor Robber.
Dear Bulletin.—After several years close associa-
tion with the Parliamentary institutions of this
country, it is a mystery to me how burglary and
garotting ever came to be prohibited by law. I
am satisfied that, at any rate, when the first
prehistoric Parliament carried the measure in
question, it was fought tooth and nail by the Con-
servatives of the day, who probably had not yet
lost their tails. Certainly nothing so moves the
Opposition in the Australian Parliament as a
Bill designed to prevent swindling. The
Tory member willfight pretty vigorously the battle
of the alleged poor washerwoman, and the
poor widow, and other more or less imaginary
indigent persons who are supposed to be
subsisting on the strangulation of some Australian
industry, but their fight is a half-hearted affair
compared with that put up in defence of the per-
son who is desirous of committing robbery straight
out. From the very first month of the Australian
Parliament’s existence the offenders of a quasi-
criminal nature have had a hard battle fought for
them, and have received more Tory support and
sympathy than any other section of the com-
munity. In the course of my experiences, I have
frequented the coffee-stalls and wine-shops of
Little Lonsdale-street and Little Bourke-street,
and I have consorted with thieves on occa-
sions, but I have never heard such all-round
vigorous support of crookedness as comes
from the Tory members of the Australian and
Victorian Legislatures. The man who desires to
import deleterious substance to poison Australia
wholesale finds people to “barrack” for him as if he
were a philanthropist. The person who is guilty
of deliberate fraud, without any extenuating cir-
cumstances, is pleaded for like a small boy led
astray by evil companions, and endeavor after
endeavor is made to reduce the amount of fine it
is proposed to mulct him in. If, in any instance,
imprisonment without fine is suggested, the whole
force of Conservatism rises in a mass to weep on
behalf of the poor robber. The adulterator of foods,
the short-weight thief, the affixer of misleading
brands, has more friends than a stable boy at
Cup time, and even the poor spy found Senators
to plead for him, when the Wireless Telegraphy
Bill was before the Horise. lam satisfied that if
burglary was a new offence, and a measure was
brought into the Australian Parliament to make
it punishable, there would be weeks of speeches,
firstly, to block the proposal, and, if that failed,
to permit the burglar to expiate his offence with a
small fine.—H. Glubb.
“ Hwac,” on a matter that calls for prompt and
vigorous inquiry :
It has come to my knowledge that history is not taught
in our public schools with the impartiality which should
be associated with the teaching of that important subject.
At a well-known public school in the city of Sydney
the teacher of history is a B.A. of Sydney University, and,
with the customary enthusiasm of the book pedant, he is
an apostle of Freetrade. For that we can only pity him
and hope for greater enlightenment. But at present he
is doing a great mischief in making use of his position to
instil into the ever-ready minds of his pupils the insidious
doctrines he professes. This is a typical lesson : Subject,
“ The Corn Law Agitation.”
Teacher : “ Stand up the boys who are Protectionists.”
The great majority stand.
Teacher : “ But don’t you see that the abolition of the
Corn Laws made foo l much cheaper? ” etc., etc.
Small Malcontent : “ But, sir ” .
Teacher: “Sit down, Smith. The trouble with you is
that you don’t take a broad-minded view of the subject.
Stand, the boys who are Protectionists now.”
About three have the courage to stand. And those
three are made to feel the blastiferous contempt of this
man of culture and Bachelor of Arts ! Fiscal conversions
effected wholesale in five minutes.
Youth has a lively dread of ridicule and a great rever-
ence for the magic letters “ 8.A.” It may take years
of practical life to remove the results of this pernicious
theorising. Surely rabid fiscal dogmatists could be pre-
vented from carrying on propaganda work in the school-
room !
“Wanderer” writes from Buenos Ayres (South
America): —
Re Argentina tariff (Bulletin 6/6/’O5). Argentine in-
dustries owe their growth to the splendid protective
tariff of the Government of this country. While the in-
dustries ware young and the workmen inexperienced, the
Government put a good stiff export tax on raw materials,
thus helping the factory to get its raw materials at fail-
prices. There is also a very hot Customs duty on manu-
factured goods coming into the country. These duties
are continued till the industries are on their feet, and
then the first tax to be taken off is that on export. This
Government seems to realise that industries are necessary
for the country’s progress, and will have none of the
Calico Jimmy ideas. The idea that men are rushing to
Argentina to get on the land is all bosh. They are rush-
ing here and working in factories and at railroad building-.
As to settlement, as settlement should be, there’s none in
Argentina. Huge land speculators hold the country
in their iron clutch. Freehold estates run from
one million acres downwards. These big slabs of
country are generally held by the British. They, to
Argentina, are what the German Jew is to the Rand.
English capital owns the railways. The giant is the
Southern. The capital, &c., of the co. is £27,000,000. These
railways bleed the land of the last penny they can get
hold of. Then the freezing co.’s are nearly all British.
The ships that carry the meat are all British, and the
public debt is nearly all held by Britain. In fact, John
Bull is Argentina’s Jew. Argentina can read Australia
a lesson in finance, however. Its loans all carry a
sinking fund which is paid in actual reduction of the
loans. It doesn’t collar the sinking fund, as Dick
Sf.ddon did, nor treat repayments of loan moneys as
income, like Carrutiiers. What a pity your Australian
Labor party has no fixed political beliefs on the Tariff
question !
The Jap Imperialist.
One of the most peculiar features of Australian.
Imperialism is its change of front during recent
years. It is not very long ago since a war was
being -waged in South Africa, and the united
voice of the Imperialists of Australia was raised
on behalf of the Semitic-Mongolian alliance now
controlling the country. There was nothing to be
proud of in the remarks made at that time. A very
large number of the spellbinders who sent hundreds
of Australians to fight in Africa are now, doubtless,
considerably ashamed of themselves. Neverthe-
less, the brand of Imperialism advocated then was
infinitely better than that ladled out to-day by
those who are most fervid in their devotion to the
Vampire. The cry for the blood of the Boer was
at least an expression of the natural primi-
tive man, eager to get within hitting distance
of the other man. It was brutal, but it
possessed some virtues of vigor and courage, j
The struggles of the viking, the buccaneer, the 1
burglar who puts up a hard fight, all have a certain
virtue, and the Boer struggle carried with it some
of the virtues of those courageous persons. But to- .
day—three brief years later—the attitude of the
Australian Imperialist is different. He no longer
stands upright, defying the world in the name of i
Britain. His backbone has weakened. His
voice has changed to a shrill treble. He craves
for help, and tumbles over himself to crawl to
a foreign power. To any decent Englishman or 1
Australian the spectacle of Spruce Myth and
Pulsford and Zeal and half-a-dozen other
Australian legislators recently, must have been .
nauseating. Australians are not English, but they
retain sufficient respect for the country from which
their fathers came to resent the crawlsome atti- ;
tude of the persons named towards the Monkey of j
Japan. The old-style Imperialist, who said that
one Englishman was equal to three Frenchmen, ■
and was willing to back up his erroneous opinion
with his strength and courage, seems to : have dis- '
appeared. Now, he whines that three Englishmen
aren’t as good as one Jap. We find to-day, in the
Australian Imperialist, a person eager to humble ■
himself like a national Uriah Heep before
a mushroom colored people who were no- i
thing yesterday and may be nothing to-morrow.
According to Myth, Pulsford, Zeal, and co.
the Jap is not only the equal of the Englishman,
but hiS superior. Pulsford, the other day, ex-
tolled the bravery of the Japs to the skies, and
read a slab of Bennet Burleigh. But lie omitted
to read that part in Which Burleigh stated that
the Japs had to be shot by court-martial in dozens ,
for cowardice, before they were made. to face
the Russian bayonets. Neither did Pulsford
refer to the commercial morality of Japan,
which is just about as high as that of the
importing class for which Pulsford has been bar-
racking all his life. Nor of the legal morality
which often prevents theforeignersgettinga verdict
before a Japanese tribunal, unless he has enough
money to persuade the noble Daimio on the bench
to forego his patriotic feelings. Nor of the sexual
morality of Japan, which prompts the loving
parent to sell his daughter to the bagnio, in order
that he may have money to spend at the club, and
the husband to let out his wife to his foreign ;
friends who are rich enough to pay for the ,
privilege. The old British bull-dog would
appear to have been sacked without notice
or compensation by the Australian Imperial-
ist, to' be replaced by a cur willing to lick
the hand of any sort of creature who won’t
kick it. Britannia has been deposed, and the
goddess of the latter-day Imperialists is Rahae,
the lady who betrayed her countrymen to the in-
vading Jews at Jericho.
♦
Johnstone River (Q.), where some Australian
settlers are preparing homes for a number of
their countrymen, is one of the wettest places in
Australia; the annual rainfall sometimes reaches
200 .inches. The leader of the colony, Gregor,
was for some years engaged as a chemist in the
Plane Creek sugar mill, and he says that
before the settlement is complete he ex-
pects the number to reach a few hundreds.
If one-third the State money and the private
capital sunk in trying to populate arid re-
claim Queensland’s arid west had been applied to
the development of the immensely rich coastal
districts of North Queensland, the State’s popula-
tion would probably number 2,000,000 by this year
of partial repentance, 1905. But the Ministries of
the past could see no interests but those of the
sheep-breeder and the cattle man, and only talked
of northern settlement in association with Chinese
and Kanakas. The possibilities of the Johnstone
are very great, even with cattle, as witness one
settler whose 640 acres .carry 1000 horned stock all
the year round. When, dairying begins in earnest
in those great coastal tracts of the north, Australia
will be able, if it feels so disposed, to raise enough
butter to grease the axle of the universe.
“ Wiljar ” : Re general agreement in Australia
' (8., 21/9/’O5) that a strengthening of the popula-
tion, other than by the birth-rate, is necessrry.
; We don’t want immigration as things are. I’ve
1 lived in the suburbs, where one chip has to boil
the kettle, and one crust is divided. Have settled
in country townships, where half the local unem-
ployed cut out the other half by smoodging, and
going for less. I have shared pipe-dust and post-
and-rail tea with men who march across this con-
tinent, looking for the job which is snapped up by
the local man, or the Indian, or the infant, or the
reformatory-boy, or the imbecile who doesn t
know a sovereign when he sees it. Have learned
to know that we have enough people here already.
This talk about engaging more hands, when the
old hands are bellowing for their back pay,
and the boss comes home from the store with a tin
of treacle under his wing and no flour, is intoler-
able. Immigration ought to receive a straight
left-hander—for the present, anyway. When
Australia has become a flourishing country of self-
supporting men and women, and its own
machinery and artisans have caused the rich im-
porter to retire, worsted ; when the mortgagee’s
man has ceased to plant himself in the stubble at
night to shepherd the unsuspecting cocky’s
bushels, and each habitation has its own wood-heap,
and isn’t rented—then things will be different.
But, until then, the idea of standing empty-bellied
on the wharf, extending a warm welcome (and a
cold paw) to strangers who have come to jump his
pot-jostling situation at the fourpenny restaurant,
will, to present writer, be positively distasteful.
♦
It is significant, in connection with tl e
alleged “ unfair discrimination against our Chino: e
fellow-subjects,” which certain traitorous ai.ti-
Australians used as an argument to persuade
the Vic. House of Landlords to throw out
the Amending Factories Act, that there was no
talk about unfair discrimination when Bent put
through his Gold Buyers Act last year. Yet the
said Act absolutely prohibits the issue of a gold-
buying license to any Chow whatsoever, just
because he is a Chow, and if he is found compet-
ing with the Upper House’s banks in that business
he gets particular Gehenna. It is quite right and
proper to shut out the yellow trader or merchant,
but to exclude, or even supervise, the colored
worker is un-British, unfair, and altogether im-
moral.


Serious Words.
Our century is the age of scientific enlightenment and research.
We no longer accept the workings of the forces of Nature as
inexplicable. We seek for the motive power; and if we do not
always find the right interpretation of various phenomena, we can
generally give a plausible one.
One of the most brilliant achievements of science is the art of
prolonging the life of the human species, that supremest result of
scientific development; the art of pursuing a particular treatment
that will keep the body in more perfect health, supply it with greater
strength, and so make the individual happier. Hundreds of our
greatest thinkers who are devoting all their thoughts to this great
and mighty problem are making it the aim of their lives; and
although this branch of science, called hygienics, is still compara-
tively young, it can even now be demonstrated that the average life of
man is longer than it formerly was. What a difference compared to
past ages, when thousands of men perished from causes which we
now consider as avoidable !
And yet the most colossal ignorance, the most childish
superstitions still amble, as it were, complacently hand in hand with
this advance in reasoning power. We live in an age of contrasts,
amongst which none are more remarkable than the spectacle of
perversity, bred of ignorance and false traditions, sturdily holding
its own against logic and ratiocination.
Even at present the greatest ignorance prevails respecting one
of the principal problems of life, the proper care of that portion of
our organism upon which depends the nourishment of the body,
the purity of the blood, and the healthy condition of the nerves —our
teeth.
But how shall they be kept healthy ? With a tooth-brush and
tooth-powder or tooth-paste, is the almost universal reply. And
herein lies one of the most irreparable blunders of our time !
It has been long demonstrated that the teeth are destroyed by
chemical and bacterial processes. A whole scientific literature exists
proving beyond the possibility of doubt that it is impossible to
preserve the teeth without keeping the mouth antiseptically clean
and in a healthy condition; that is to say, free from microbes and
fermentation. processes.
But in spite of all this the majority of us confine the care of our
teeth to brushing them with tooth-powders or tooth-pastes, as if the
whole art of keeping the teeth in good condition merely depended
on superficially cleansing them from impurities, just as dust is
removed from china. The teeth are discoloured, attacked, and
ultimately brought to distress by something far more serious than
dust that can be brushed off—by microbes and processes of fermenta-
tion ; And it is necessary to combat these processes in the only
way in which they can be combated ; that is, by antiseptics, and by
liquid antiseptics that will wash the whole mouth.
Only a moment’s reflection should convince everybody that
one can reach only the external surface of the teeth with prepara-
tions like tooth-powder and tooth-paste; but our teeth are not so
obliging as to decay only in .places which we can conveniently
reach with brushes, powders, and pastes. On the contrary, mischief
mostly begins precisely in those localities which are difficult of
access—such as the backs of the molars, in the interstices of the
teeth, and other cavities. Thus it is self-evident that in order to
protect the teeth from injury and to keep them sound it is absolutely
indispensable to use an antiseptic fluid which will come in contact
with all parts of the mouth and teeth, penetrate hollows, pass
between the interstices, enter fissures, antiseptically cleanse the
backs of the molars, and, in short, be effective everywhere.
The necessity of this is also demonstrated by the fact that
almost every one who cleans the teeth daily with such antiquated
preparations as tooth-.powders and tooth-pastes has damaged teeth,
particularly the back teeth. How many millions of teeth are yearly
sacrificed to this childish method of cleaning ?
We want a fluid antiseptic cleansing preparation which will
wash the whole mouth, reach the remotest corners, and by means
of its disinfectant powers arrest the processes injurious to the teeth
This result can be secured with absolute certainty, as has been
demonstrated by modern science,*by the new liquid dentifrice, Udol-
Odol is the first and only preparation for cleansing the mouth
and teeth which absolutely counteracts the causes of microbic
fermentation. While all other preparations are effective only during
the few moments of application, the antiseptic and refreshing power
of Odol continues gently but persistently for hours afterwards.
This absolutely' certain effect, scientifically proved, is principally
due to an entirely new and unique property of the preparation
which causes it to penetrate the interstices of the teeth and the
mucous membrane of the. mouth, to a certain extent impregnating
them and thus securing an after-effect lasting for hours which
no other mouth-wash can produce, not even approximately.
Owing to this characteristic, peculiar only to Odol, the whole
oral cavity, to its minutest recesses, is completely freed from and
protected against all fermenting processes and injurious bacteria.
It follows that every one who daily and regularly cleanses
his mouth and teeth with Odol will practise the most perfect
hygiene of the mouth and teeth in-accordance with recent scientific
principles.

There’s another lesson for the ‘ ‘ Free-
trade ” Laborites in the Yic. boiled shirt industry.
The Victorian tariff protected this to the extent
of 35 per cent. ; and with this safeguard the
employers acceded, without dispute, to the em-
ployees’ demands for a wage which was low, but
still much higher than the foreign rate. In ’Ol
the Federal legislature reduced this 35 percent,
tp 25, less a 5 per cent, duty on raw material,
thus making the net result equal to 20 per cent.
The English shirt-maker gets no minimum wage,
and his or her hours run from 60 to 80 per week
instead of 48 ; consequently, the Melbourne shirt-
factories cannot compete against him, and to-day
more than a quarter of the hands they used to
employ are idle, while cargoes of sweater-made
goods are dumped on the wharves.
“ F.H.” from Denver (U.S.A.)
Met a professor of Political Economy at Chicago Uni-
versity who informed me he was writing a book dealing
with Australian politics. When I asked him how long it
was since he was out there he said “Never,” but he had
been reading the S.M. Herald since 1882, and all Parlia-
mentary debates recorded in N.S.W. and Victoria since
that year. Amongst other astounding things he told me
was that George Reid and M'Millan were the two best
“statesmen” in N.S.W., and he considered Turner’s
financial administration of Victoria to be absolutely
farcical. On my questioning him he confessed he was a
Freetrader, and seemed very surprised at my guessing it.
Fancy reading Granny since ’B2 ! He has been commis-
sioned by the Standard Oil Co. to write a book against
Municipal Ownership for circulation in Chicago, where
the people on a recent referendum declared for it by a
large majority. He told me of a Harvard undergrad,
who, when he heard the prof, received papers from Aus-
tralia, asked him where he had learnt the language.
Except during the gold boom, when every-
one expected to dig up a fortune in one act, and
during the assisted immigration period, Australia
has never attracted many immigrants, solely
because the European Hodge couldn’t pay the
passage-money. Seventy or 80 years ago, one
Bishop Hinds was damaged in his mind over the
immigration problem, just as other bishops are
now, but he reckoned that the trouble lav in the
want of an aristocracy. Speaking of “the unedu-
cated clown” and “the drudging mechanic,” His
Remote Gaiters said :
He was accustomed to see the squire’s house and park,
and he misses this object not only when his wants, which
found relief there, recur, bub simply because he, from a
child, has been accustomed to see gentry in the land.
The Old Gaiters proposed that Australia should
put things right by encouraging British aristocrats
to come out here, each one to receive a patent of
nobility for himself and his heirs, an estate, and
“an hereditary station in the government of the
future community.”
A Bar verdict:—
Of the present N.S.W. Judges, Chief Justice Darley is a
good lawyer, who, as a Judge, seems unconsciously
anxious to secure a verdict for the side which he believes
to be right, but which often isn’t. He was known in
former days as “ a great verdict-getter.” This propensity
continues. Justice Owen is a tired Judge, who tries to
relieve the tedium of official duty by rasping witticisms,
some of which are very good, and will pass into future
collections of judicial jokes ; the rest are mere rasp with-
out wit. Justice G. B. Simpson is a keen lawyer,
and can follow a legal argument through its most
intricate mazes, enlightening it from time to time
with precedents drawn from “ the time when I
was Attorney-General” (which is his King Charles’
head). He is a kindly, benign man, patient and endur-
ing of counsels’ bad arguments, but savagely intolerant
if they tie their cravats or bands negligently, wear check
trousers, or put their umbrellas on the bar table. He is
courteous to all m§n and civil to the persons in the dock,
sentencing them to long terms of imprisonment with a
graciousness which brings thanks to the convict’s lips as
for a favor conferred, before he realises the true inward-
ness of the sentence. It is a pleasure—momentary,
perhaps, but still a pleasure—to be sentenced to 10 years’
hard by Justice G. B. Simpson. Justice Cohen is not a
brilliant lawyer, but he has an infinite fund of patience
and painstaking common sense. He is a success on the
Bench. Justice Prynnge, a lawyer keen upon small points
and learned in technicality, is a judicial failure. Justice
Gregory Walker, until lately, used to work one day a week
and transact business in a bored fashion. He is now, in
the absence of G. B. Simpson, plunged into the fascinating
vortex of the Divorce Court; but he does not begin work
until 10.30, half-an-hour later than the other Judges.
Justice A. H. Simpson, of the Equity side, is—after the
Arbitration Judge—the hardest-worked lawyer in the
State. He, however, unlike the Arbitration man, makes
most of the work himself, as he suffers from a dilated
conscientiousness, and a propensity to put innocent
English words on the rack with the ruthlessness of a
judicial Torquemada.

From an Awful Skin Humour Covering
Entire Body—Scratched Till Blood
Ran Wasted to Skeleton Hands
Like Claws—Cuticura Brings Blessed
Relief and Speedy Cure.
“WOULD HAVE DIED
BUT FOR CUTICURA”
“ When my little boy was three months
old his head broke out with a rash, which
was very itchy and ran considerable
watery fluid. We tried everything we
could, but he got worse all the time till it
spread to his arms, legs, and then to his
entire body, and he came near dying. It
itched so he would scratch till the blood
ran, and a thin yellowish stuff would be
all over his pillow in the morning. I had
to put mittens on his hands to keep him
from tearing his skin. He got so weak
he took fainting spells and we would
think him dying. He was almost a skel-
eton and his little hands were thin like
claws.
“ He was bad about eight months when
we tried Cuticura. I had not laid him
down in his cradle in the daytime for a
long time. He had got so that he just
slept in our arms all the time.
“I washed him with Cuticura Soap and
put on one application of Cuticura
Ointment and he was so soothed that I
put him in the cradle. You don’t know
how glad I felt when he felt better. It
took one box of Cuticura Ointment,
pretty near one cake of Cuticura Soap, and
about half a bottle of Cuticura Resolvent,
to cure. I think he would have died
only for the Cuticura.”
Mrs. M. C. MAITRAND, Jasper, Ont.
No return in 14 years: Mrs. Maitland
writes, under date of Feb. 24, 1903: “It
affords me pleasure to inform you that
it is fourteen years since my boy was
cured of the terrible skin disease. He has
been permanently cured and is hearty
and strong.”

The Inky Way.
Fremantle (W.A.) is the graveyard of newspaper enter-
prise. Nearly 50 years ago it possessed the only daily
paper in ’Groperland, but the journal drifted Perthwards,
and, since then, every attempt to run a paper at the Port
has failed. Yosper and half-a-score of others tackled the
job, but their experiences were not encouraging. Several
journalists connected with the West Australian started
a small sporting weekly, The Empire. It was afterwards
acquired by Jimmy Thomson, who worked it up into a
very good property, enlarging its scope, arid bringing it
out twice weekly. Then he was tempted to convert it
into a daily, and at the end of twelve months Jimmy was
busted. Several of the literary and mechanical staff of
Jimmy’s paper essayed to carry it on under another
name, but they shared the same fate in about the same
time. Now the plant has been acquired by a Perth pro-
prietary with plenty of capital, and, with the introduc-
tion of monolines, a fresh lease of life is assured. Fre-
mantle is only 12 miles from Perth, which, as the capital
naturally gets the cream of the news, also of the advertis-
ing. There are two morning papers at Perth, also a huge
advertising concern that does duty for am evening ditto.
After the drapery and other firms have been canvassed
every morning and evening, a Fremantle paper has no
show, and the town must therefore support its own ran-
A. E. Morgans is said to practically own the evening
paper at Perth, though the visible boss is A. Lovekim
He chummed in with late Alex. Forrest, and induced him
to start the Morning Herald ten years ago. At first it
did splendidly, the Government ad'vts. running into £6OOO
a year, but, of late, the amount has been woefully
reduced. Perth has a small population, and a second
morning paper has to browse among the nettles and
thistles by the roadside for a bare subsistence. The
Herald is now mainly proprietaried by Bishop Gibney on
behalf of the R.C. community, Grattan Grey being on
the editorial staff.

“ O’F.” : Gnat Levi’s recent wail about the treatment
of the Jews in Russia reminds me of the time in the
middle ’nineties, when he was running Melbourne Even-
ing News. He was then greatly concerned about the
treatment of compositors in Melbourne. Their charges
(which he considered exorbitant) were an abounding
mystery to Nathaniel, especially when it wUs a question
of “fat,” and the representative of the men had to engage
in many a heated argument with him to support their
following of established usages. YVhat seemed to puzzle
Gnat more than anything was the compo.’s charging a full
line for a heading, or the last line of a paragraph, with,
as he pointed out, very often only one word in the line.
The News was a quaint production altogether. Some of
its early pages appeared with half of the blpck composing:
the outside column sawn off, as it was found at the last
moment that the “ chases ” were too small to contain all
the columns, and “ furniture ” had been ordered with too
sparing a hand to make up. the difference. Other evi-
dences of “ economy ” were patent throughout the paper.
The News did not last long under this treatment, though
a legend floats around that one copy, fresh only as.'to
date, was struck off daily until quite recently, to keep the
great organ on the list of going concerns.
* * * *
Among ex-Judge Casey’s almost numberless Vic. ven-
tures was a goldfields paper, The Bek. His partner in
that was J. D. Crofts, the legal manager who died lately.
But kindly old Crofts, at any rate, had no sting. And
neither of them could make honey— not the sort with the
royal image on it, anyhow. Which recalls that, for a
third of a century or so now, the Bendigo press has had
its “ Mosquito ’’—the pen name of E. A. Banks, of the
Independent. Bendigo only breaks in reporters for ser-
vice elsewhere; but it keeps its editors till they grow
hoary. “ Old Bob ” Haverfield, of the rival Advertiser,
set that fashion. “ How d’ you manage to stick at it ?” a
youngster asked “Old Bob” once. “By never reading
my own paper,” he said.
* * * *
“T.D.”: What cut-throat conditions rule in England
among the agencies for newspaper cuttings! There are
dozens of these agencies in London, and directly a' name
creeps into print anywhere, its owner is raided with
invitations to subscribe a guinea or so a year with the
object of having a continuous supply of such paragraphs
as happen to contain his name. Yet the poor wretch
may be a person whose name is never likely to be men-
tioned again all the rest of his days. Even the oldest and
best of the agencies have to be as keen as a rat gnawing
at a file in order to keep their end-up. I have at hand a
letter from one leading firm recalling the fact that it had
previously offered to collect criticisms, and mentioning
that “we feel uncertain whether you realise the full
value and interest that these clippings are to yourself,
or whether you have been unable to give the question the
attention it most truly merits.” Much persuasive elo-
quence of the same kind follows, till I feel as if I had
sacrificed a fortune or an empire through not taking
Smith, Bloggs and Co.’s clippings.
* * * *
“Stony” : One of the many absurd duties which an
effete civilisation has thrust upon the thirty-bob country
reporter is that of replying to the toast of “ The Press ”
at township A.N.Ative shivoos and such weird dissipa-
tions. I remember an occasion in a Murray town when
the local agitators had raked up a couple" of real live
M.’sL.A. to inspect and talk about and feed over a hit of
a bridge. _ There were the usual toasts—“ The King ” and
“ Mr. Smith,” and so on —and then the stereotyped press
toast, when the five district “organs” had to make five
distinct and separate acknowledgments. We all said
something like “ Mister Ohair-r-r—h’m ” and sat
down. And nobody seemed a penny the better.
* * • •
“ U.”: I found an elaborately-bound volume con-
cerning “ Prince Alfred in Victoria ” on a bookseller’s
tuppenny table the other day. Books written by or
about royalty invariably reach their true level. Queen
Victoria’s stodgy “Leaves from My Journal in the High-
lands” is frequently offered at a penny without finding
takers, and even the recent Yorklet volumes are now as
hard to clear as stale theology. The main justification
for the existence of the Alfred book is that it may be
used as a shocking example of the depths that toadyism
leads to. _ The writers of the addresses presented to
“ Her Majesty’s petit representative ” (as the compiler
calls him) tried hard to beat each other in crawlsomeness
while “humbly begging to offer most respectful and
most dutiful assurances of the intense gratification
afforded by the esteemed presence of your Royal
Highness in this colony.” Miles of this sort of
stuff, with Alfred’s formal replies, are printed ;
but all the truly humorous incidents of the’
tour (such as squatter Moffat’s ordering “ a ton of books ”
to form a library when he heard that Victoria’s son was
coming to visit him) are carefully excluded. One of the
quaintest productions in the book is the address in which
Melbourne Paunch tried to be skittish and grovelsome at
the same time. It remarked that “if we are a trifle
exuberant in our display of loyalty, you will see no evil in
our boisterous ovations, but, perhaps, relish our welcome
the more for the lack of ceremony accompanying it ”
Then Paunch asked Alfred to “forgive the follies of
youth," and referred to itself as “ a chartered libertine.”
The idea of Melbourne’s journalistic dodderer trying to be
a regular Don Juan of a paper is amusing.
A PROVERB.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
An ass there was in other days,-
A grey old ass, with little sense,
A donkey’s customary ways,
And ears immense.
He browsed on thistles, water quaffed,
Not discontented with his yoke,
Until he saw that all men laughed
Whene’er he spoke.
II he but stood and wagged his ears,
With laughter wild did they rejoice,
And all men shed hilarious tears
Who heard his voice.
The ass, delighted, brayed again,
And found each time he made a hit.
“ My stars ! ’’ he said, “ ’tis very plain
I am a wit 1 ”
His proper yoke he threw away,
He cut an unbecoming caper,
And started he, that very day,
A comic paper.

we have honestly cured more men of their troubles than any similar
association of Medical Practitioners practising in Commonwealth, we

not cure men by honest treatment, we would not hold the position of
pre-eminence as Specialists, which we have held for 25 years. We
follow the precepts of those great Masters in Genito-Urinary Diseases,
Ricord of France and Kane of America, and their methods are our
models. We cure quickly Gravel, Stone in Kidney, Weakness in Men,

“ Ignis Via ” writes :—
An exile in Maoriland, I would like to add words to the
word from S’Afriea (B. 19/10/’05). There are thousands of
Australians in ttiis country who listen to the sound of
your hammering at Protection, graduated land-tax, self-
reliance, etc., and long for its result. Maoriland is a good
country, but it isn’t ours. Her j we feel like boarded-out
kids. Your demand for an Australia that can support its
own children warms our hearts.
When you cease being persistent I for one will com-
mence being anarchist. To us, who left home to look for
work and land, the Booth immigration proposal is a great
joke.
About a bygone potentate :—
J. F. Hogan furnishes the Advocate with a synopsis of
Col. Yeitoll’s new memoir of Andrew Clarke, to which
Sydenham Clarke, late Victorian Governor, writes a
preface. Andrew was born 1824, son of a whilom
Westralian Governor, Marcus Clarke being Andrew’s
cousin. He went to Tasmania as Governor Denison’s
secretary. He had a brief spell in Maoriland, with George
Grey, as an interlude to his V.D.L. work. In 1853, Clarke
moved to Victoria as Surveyor-General, at £1200 a year,
with a seat in the Legislative Council. He lived at
Mem Creek, near Heidelberg, and his office was in
the building where the Mint is now. Clarke founded
municipal government, advocated Australian federation
‘ as a Commonwealth,” planned Melbourne’s parks and
public .gardens, and had charge of the Bills for the con-
struction of the railroads from Geelong to Ballarat, and
Melbourne to Bendigo. Under the new constitution he
was elected M.L.A. for Emerald Hill, now South Mel-
bourne. The election cost him £700, David Blair being
the defeated candidate. .Clarke became Minister of Lands
in the first Victorian Government; and Governor Barkly,
at a crisis, invited him to form a Ministry, which he
declined to do. At the age of little more than 30, Clarke
became entitled to £800 a year pension. He was dis-
appointed at not being appointed first Governor of
Queensland.
Not generally known that the stately air
of “ Gor’save,” in its earlier form, was composed
by Dr. John Bull about 300 years ago. A revised
edition was printed in 1740, and sung in 1745 as
an anthem, at Drury Lane Theatre, though
almost the same words, set to similar music, were
then said to have been sung at St. James’s Chapel
and in the streets of London as a loyal Catholic
hymn for King James II. what time Dutch
William was coming along with his Orange
banner. In its sectarian aspect the history of
“ Gor’save ” seems very mixed. Dr. John Bull,
who died in 1628 at Antwerp, was a Roman
Catholic. The hymn sung at St. James’s
Chapel was “ 0 Lord, oUr God, arise ! Frustrate
the'enernies of James, our King ! Send him vic-
torious,” &c., &c. When it popped up later at
Drury Lane as the “Anthem,” the name George
took the place of James, and the Almighty was
desired to “ confound their Popish tricks.” Fifty
years later a German composer stple the amended
version of John Bull’s melody and altered it
slightly, and then it went for the national song of
Prussia, Saxony, and other States now incorpor-
ated in Kaiser William’s empire.

TO men who have wasted the energy of youth ; to men who have found

men, and to all men who feel that their vital forces are slow of action, and
lacking in the fire of youth, we say that we can build you up, make you
strong and robust, so that you can take your place alongside any man and

I WHAT IS CATARRH?
Catarrh is inflammation of
the lining membrane of the
nose ant) adjoining passages.
If this inflammation is not
arrested it invades the, pas-
sages which lead from the
nose to the head, ears, thro : at
and lungs. It injures the
sight and hearing, destroys
'he sense of taste and smell,
renders the breath offensive,
breaks down the affected tis-
sues, consumes the nasal car-
tileges, and rots away the
small frontal bones of the
skull. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and sto-
mach, causes dyspepsia, also

BRONCHITIS AND PLEURISY.
A SEVERE CASE CURED BY TWO BOTTLES OP
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE.
AFTER OTHER TREATMENT HAD FAILED.
Mr. Hearne, Chemist,, Geelong-.
Dear Sir, —Some months ago, in Sydney-, I suffered from
a severe attack of influenza, and was confined to my room
for about a week, at the end of which time, feeling some-
what better, I got up and tried to transact my business
as usual. But I got up too soon, for the very next day I
had a relapse, and suffered tortures from what the doctor
told me was pleurisy and bronchitis. The pain from the
former in my chest and shoulders was frightful, and for
four long weeks I was confined to my bed, under the care
of a well-known Sydney doctor, and all the time his medi-
cir •> gave me but temporary relief. The landlady of the
h0,.j,l (the Cleveland),w'here I resided told me of a medi-
cine—Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure—from Victoria, which had
cured her of a bad attack of bronchitis and pains in the
chest, and begged of me to try it. I did so, and, in thanks
and gratitude to you, tell you that, after the second bottle,
my cough had ceased ; but, what is more astonishing, the
pains from pleurisy entirely left me, and, in about a week,
I w-as able to attend to my duties as usual.—Yours faith-
fully, J. BRAHAM,
Melbourne Punch Office, Melbourne.

severe cough and cold on the chest, I am sending you
this testimonial to make any use of it you wish. I have
used many cough medicines and can unhesitatingly say
that yours gave me the quickest relief, and I have not

AFTER OTHER TREATMENT HAD FAILED.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir,—lt is with much thank-
fulness I write to let you know that I have taken three
Dottles of your Bronchitis and Asthma Cure. I had pre-
viously suffered terribly from asthma for about three
years, and had tried everything, and had advice, but
without avail. I had been for a fortnight at a time with-
out moving day or night out of my chair. If I went to
bed I was not able to lie down. We came to New Zealand
about three years ago from Tasmania. One of my uncles
there suffered with asthma for a number of years till he
took your cure about five years ago, and has never had
the asthma since. I knew this, but it had passed out of
my mind until reading your advertisement in some Tas-
man an papers brought it to my memory. I told my
husband, and he got y.our cure for me, which I have taken
with completely satisfactory result.—Yours respectfully

LIFE SAVED BY HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure
in stating that I have derived great benefit from taking
Hearne’s Bronchitis cure. Can confidently say it has
saved my life. I was a martyr to Acute Bronchitis before
taking it. I trust this letter will induce others to trv
it, —Yours truly,
E. F. BROTHERTON,

A CHILD SEVEN MONTHS OLD—A SUFFERER
FROM BIRTH.
CURED BY A EOTTLE OF HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS
CURE.
M f- W -, G - Hearne. Dear Sir,-Kindly forward hie a
small bottle of your Bronchitis Cure as soon as possible,
as I cannot speak above a whisper, owing- to a cold I
had a bottle from you before for my little girl when she
was seven months old. She had been suffering from
bronchitis from her birth, and now she is three years old
and has not had a return of it since. It is a splendid
medicine for bronchitis or colds of any sort.—l remain
yours truly,
Mrs. H. RAMAGE,
Violet Town, Victoria.
A SEVEN YEARS’ CASE.
EXPECTORATING BLOOD AND MATTER.
COMPLETELY CURED.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.
Dear Sir,—Your medicine has cured me of bronchitis
and asthma, from which I had suffered for upwards of
seven years, during which period I was scarcely ever free
from coughs, and frequently the difficulty of breathing
was so distressing that for nights in succession I had to
sit up. I write you this acknowledgment from a sense
of duty, as in my case every other treatment had failed.
For a year previous I had beeii getting very much worse,
and at the time I obtained your medicine I was confined
to bed, suffering from a most violent cough, expec-
torating blood and matter, and apparently beyond hope
of recovery. The first dose of the medicine gave me
welcome relief, and I steadily improved as I continued
the treatment, until I became as I am now, quite well.—
Yours sincerely,
H. WALKER, Balmain, Sydney.
BRONCHITIS.
A VERY OBSTINATE CASE.
CURED THROUGH PERSEVERING IN THE TREAT
MENT BY HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —Having been a sufferer
from Bronchitis for a number of years, and not being able
to get relief from Doctors, I started taking your Bron-
chitis Cure about two years ago, and have been taking it
on and off ever since. I am happy to tell you that I now
feel thoroughly cured, and I can bear testimony to its
worth.—l am yours truly,

From Mr. G. Lucas, tobacconist, Kapunda, S.A., 7th December, 1904.
“.I have great pleasure in recommending Warner’s Safe Cure to anyone troubled with gravel,
knowing from personal experience what suffering one undergoes when once this dreadful complaint is
contracted, and how it unfits him for the most ordinary duties of life. I suffered for a long time and
was unable to get relief. My urine was thick and ropy, and at times full of dark colored sediment; at
other times it was of a green color. I was almost afraid to drink anything, knowing the burning pains
I would have to endure. My stomach was very irritable, my digestion bad with little appetite, and
sweats at night. I became seriously alarmed after trying many remedies without obtaining any
benefit. A friend, living at Kapunda, who had been cured of the same complaint bv Warner's Safe
Cure, advised me to try it. I had very little faith, but I took his advice, and commenced taking
Warner’s Safe Cure and Warner’s Safe Dills. After taking the first few doses I was greatly
relieved, my water became less impregnated with foreign matter, and the pain decreased and
gradually left me. I continued with the medicine, and after taking it for some time a large stone
passed from me. From this time I improved in health. It is several years ago since I was cured. I
am now in good health, and have not had a return of the complaint since.”
From Mr. James Fabian, Newstead, Breakfast Creek Road, Brisbane, Q., 11th February, 1905.
“About two and a half years ago my little daughter, at that time six and a half years of age,
suffered severely from kidney colic and paralysis. She lost the use of her arms and legs, and the pain
was almost continuous. She could get no rest at night, and kept all of us awake by her screaming
from the pain. We had a doctor attending her for nine months, but his treatment did her no good.
Fie told us he had not much hope that she would get better. I happened to read one of your
pamphlets which was left at my house, and saw the symptoms of kidney colic described. I decided
to give Warner’s Safe Cure a trial. After my daughter had taken the first dose it seemed to give her
ease, and she went to sleep. We continued to give her the medicine until she had taken, in all, six
bottles, and could see her improve with every bottle she took. It is over twelve months ago since she
had the last dose. Warner’s Safe Cure restored her to health, and she has not required medicine of
any kind since. You can make what use you like of this letter, as I cannot speak too highly of
Warner’s Safe Cure in cases of kidney colic.”
From Mr. S. J. Wadrop, Mount Barker, S.A., 3rd December, 1904.
“For several years I suffered excruciating pain in the region of the kidneys, hip and groin.
I became so ill and weak that life became a burden to me, and it was torture to me to do any
manual work. I tried many medicines, but could obtain no relief that was permanent. I was
then advised to take a course of Warner’s Safe Cure, and, after taking a few bottles of that
medicine, a large stone passed from me and gave me great and immediate relief. From that time
forward my health continued to improve, I gained in weight and strength, the unbearable pain
was entirely removed, and I was once again in vigorous health and strength. The stone, which is
of large size, I have preserved, and it can be seen by anyone who will call upon me, and I shall
have great pleasure in telling personally my experience.”
From Mr. G. H. Robinson, Harbor View, Watson’s Bay, N.S.W., 29th September, 1903.
“I have much pleasure in testifying as to the value of Warner’s Safe Cure, as, gradually, and
without pain, it removed a stone from my kidneys, which had been accumulating for years.” ’
From Mr. A. Spiers, 98 Moorehead-street, Redfern, N.S.W., 10th February, 1904.
“About six years ago I was a great sufferer from gravel and kidney trouble. My doctors said I had
Bright’s Disease of the kidneys. My sight, too, became very impaired. I tried Turkish baths and
many other remedies without obtaining relief. I was in misery for at least 18 months, when a friend
advised me to give Warner’s Safe Cure a trial. I did so, taking also Warner’s Safe Bills, and in nine
weeks I was a new man. I attribute my recovery solely to Warner’s medicines, as I have not suffered
in any way since.”
From Mr. John F. Kennedy, Argyle-street, Parramatta, N.S.W., 22nd September, 1903.
“ Some years ago I was attacked by great pains in the kidneys and bladder, accompanied by
swelling in the groin. The pain was so severe that, even when lying in bed, I could scarcely bear it
whilst to walk across the room was agony. I was treated by doctors off and on for five years, and at
last they told mo it was no use giving me any more medicine, but to take care of myself and to take
plenty of nourishment. I was laid up, feeling very bad, when I happened to read one of your pam-
phlets. I sent for some Warmer’s Safe Cure, and continued taking it for three months. After taking
three or four bottles it brought gravel in great quantities from me, and I was soon able to get up and
walk about after three months on my back. I am well known in Parramatta, and people were sur-
prised to see the way I had improved after taking Warner’s Safe Cure. I went to the chemist from
whom I bought the medicine, and when I showed him the gravel it had brought from my system he
said it was marvellous.”
From Mr. James Grant, Grocer, 126 Young Street, Annandale, N.S.W., 12th February, 1903.
“Some ten years ago I was attacked by great pains in my back and groin, which at’times were so
severe that I almost screamed with agony. I was treated by doctors for fully five years, and also
tried several patent medicines, but obtained no relief. I at last despaired of ever getting well
but was recommended by a friend to try Warner’s Safe Cure, as it had given him immense relief in a
similar case. I followed his advice, and after taking the medicine for a while I passed a stone about
three-quarters of an inch long and a quarter of an inch wide. I ain pleased to say that after this stone
had come away my sufferings were at end, and I have not suffered in the slightest degree since Many
of my friends know of my case, and I always keep the stone I passed. I can confidently recommend
Warner s Safe Cure in cases like mine, as I am thoroughly convinced that it saved me many years of
agony, if not my very life itself.” J J *

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
it. f H AIN'T in ’uman nature t’ respect a
man what lets his missus make his
trowsis,” said the head packer. Feathers
had the new man in the off corner of his left eye,
but was chewing deliberately, and scattering his
philosophy for the use of the globe. There was
something very impressive about his chewing at
moments like this, it lent a ruminative profundity
to his discourse. He swept the brown paper
neatly into the end of his parcel, and paused
again, leaning on his job. “Wo man that wore
’ome-made round-the-’ouses ever done wonders in
this world,” he continued. “ Napoleon’s missus
never made his trowsis, ’n’ if Julius Ctesar’s ole
lady’d tried to push a brace o’ pants cut off a set
of father’s on to him, he’d ’a’ shown her some new
hits, take it from me. Straight, there ain’t no
call fer two opinions ’bout the bloke in breeches
with all the fullin’ in front ’n’ legs like rusty tin
cylinders. They show he ain’t got hit enough in
him to make himself respected in his own ’ome,
’n’ you can bet that at a pinch the wearer wouldn’t
have sufficient gimp t’ get up off a tack.”
Feathers punched his parcel round, and whipped
in the other end with automatic precision. “ ’N’
yet,” he said, bitterly, “half the ’ouses in town
’ud give a gooey o’ that sort a billet rather ’n take
on a lad with a tizzy’s worth o’ grit in him.
’Specially if his Trowsis had a slitherin’ chin, ’n’
the Sunday face iv a sick sheep.”
The new man packed on in a painful way. The
articles Mills handled so deftly tormented him
like things possessed of devils,' and slid all over
the bench. His face was that of a depressed
sheep, and his large, pale eyes had the intense
expression of a prestidigitateur in action.
“ Feathers,” said the town traveller, “ you’re a
heathen. You do not appreciate the refining
influence of a pure woman. Now, when I see a
man in a pair of trousers facing both ways, I
recognise the tender touch of a woman’s hand, and
know he has a good, frugal, little wife.”
“ Who knocks cats out iv him if he spits in the
render.”
“I admit the trousers mother makes are not
elegant, but by persistently making her hubby’s
pants, a thoughtful wife may save enough to bury
him.”
The trousers were Dutch-rigged and wonderful.
They were of a thick, hard, brown material, and
looked as if they might have stood alone had not
one leg been so much shorter than the other ; they
were extremely baggy fore and aft, and were cor-
rugated up the seams, and had a decided list to
port; but the criticism did not seem to reach the
wearer. He found no personal significance in the
conversation, but was absorbed in the effort to get
the paper round his parcel without spilling every-
thing. Billy the Boy, whose mere wart of a nose
poked into all mischief, had been grinning ecstati-
cally through the stair battens, and now ven-
tured to take his part in the play. He approached
the new man and examined his trousers closely,
critically, with grave concern, from several points
of view. He was very small, very inky, and had
a sense of humor much beyond his years. He
touched the new man inquisitively.
“How’d it happen, cully?” he said, pointing
at the trousers.
The new man looked down at his pants, and his
parcel went to pieces under his hand again.
He turned round once, as if to get a general view.
“ What’s wrong?” he said.
“Did you put ’em on wrong, ’r hev they gone
wrong on yer ? ” asked the printer’s devil,
anxiously.
“They’reall right, ain’t they?” asked the man,
and he dusted them carefully.
“ Oh, they’re jest the glassy, but if you didn’t
get in backwards you must ’a’ turned the corner
too soon.”
The new man suspected something jocular at
last, and he looked up, and bleated at Feathers
and the town traveller. He meant well, and
thought he was smiling, but, as Benno said, it
looked like the figure-head of a wild asylum having
spasms.
“Jimmy Jee!” ejaculated Feathers. “Some-
one stop it, for the love iv heaven.”
“Mother, I’ve come home to die,” sang G-oudy.
“Kiss me an’ I will be good,” cried Bella
Coleman, and the pasters squealed rapturously.
A new hand was always fair game to them.
The foreman cantered down the room splutter-
ing ; the new hand switched off his smile, and the
others went about the firm’s business with an
appearance of great industry.
Levi Goss, the new hand, had been engaged to
assist Feathers during the busy season, and the
packer had wasted so much time endeavoring to
teach him his business that he now regarded him
as a painful grievance, sent into the factory by
Spats and an adverse Providence for his especial
mortification. Levi was about 35, a lugubrious
and unsociable person who neither drank, smoked,
swore, nor canoodled with Beauty. “He ain’t no
hangel, but he enjoys all the disadvantages,” said
Feathers. He was always dressed in anticipation
of the worst, in heavy suits that looked as if they
had been made more by accident than design, and
wore thick, grey woollen socks, and thick, blue,
knitted mitts about his wrists, and a thick woollen
muffler, and he carried an umbrella. The packer
declared that he wore red felt chest-protectors and
woollen knee comforters, too, but that was mere
conjecture. Goss was something of a new-
chum, and spoke with the remains of a barbarous
North country dialect, the burr of which defies
every known process of literary reproduction. He
was a covert man, and avoided the girls with a
deliberate intention that became an offence in the
course of a week—an open offence calling for re-
taliation. It was crass folly to take service in a
factory full of undisciplined hussies in any spirit
but one of proper humility backed by trust in
Providence. The Beauties resented Goss’s dull,
unseeing eye and his bovine insensibility, and with
the sex’s quick instinct in discovering man’s most
vulnerable parts, opened an attack upon his
trousers.
These trousers were a source of great uneasi-
ness to Levi; they were always on his mind. It
was not the eccentricity of their style that wor-
ried him—he was plainly unconscious of their
imperfections—but the fear that any injury
should come to them, that any stain should sully
their well-preserved newness, was not merely the
natural anxiety of a careful man. There was
terror in it. For a time his little attentions were
secret. He would fearfully inspect his nether
garments by the lift windows behind the piled
bales. He went under cover to brush them many
tunes a day, and before leaving of an evening
cautiously removed every particle of factory dust.
Later, when his pants became an object of open
ridicule and a target for scorn, his distress about
tnem was open and undisguised, and still the
i-*eauties harried him with heathenish relish.
Clots of paste attached themselves to his trousers
in ways inconceivable to the wearer; adhesive
papers were picked up from every seat; flour be-
spattered them, and they were defiled with dust
and printers’ ink and gum. Levi grew haggard
in his devotion to them, and wore the look of
a hunted animal.
The factory was never without a stock joke or
two, and for a fortnight Levi’s trousers usurped
the honor. One afternoon the Fat Girl came
from the changing-room in a caricature of the
despicable garments, done in hessian, drawn on
over her petticoats, and the result was a storm of
ribald joy that drove the foreman half frantic,
and brought Spats himself up from his lurking
place in the warehouse. Purple with wrath, and
quite breathless after the exertion, he stood for a
minute at the head of the stairs, a malignant
black figure, scowling horribly. On another
occasion a large tub of paste disguised with paper
was substituted for the seat Levi usually occupied
at lunch, and Levi came up out of it so bedraggled
that his misery completely unsettled the packer,
a*id Feathers assisted manfully in cleaning him
down. This kindly office must have touched the
new hand ; at any rate it led him to repose some
little confidence in the packer. A few hours later
he approached the bench at which Feathers was
working, and said lugubriously :
“You know, Mr. Mills, I got a sorrer, I have.”
“ Whater?” gasped Feath rs.
“I got a sorrer—-here.” He smote himself on
the breast, and returned to his work, leaving the
packer in a condition of semi-paralysis. It was
too good a joke to be thrown away.
“Know what ?” said the packer to Goudy and
the clerk next morning, “Goss’s got a sorrer.
Ain’t yer, Goss? ”
Levi nodded, and pointed to his heart as if to
imply its secret nature. “Here,” he said, and
his expression was such that Goudy bent sud-
denly over a parcel and coughed violently to save
the situation.
“Hello,” said Benno, “a sorrer—eh, what?
’Tain’t a little duchess, is it?”
“No, no, no, no,” gasped Levi with trepida-
tion ; “it isn’t anything of that kind.”
“ Something he’s keeping from the missus,”
said Goudy.
“ Maybe if it ain’t women it’s the booze,”
mused Feathers. “Confide in us, Goss —weak
men the best iv us, and all mis’rable sinners.”
“Perhaps it’s his trousers,” ventured the town
traveller, with a sympathetic inflection.
Goss shook his head. “No,” he said, “it’s a
secret sorrer.”
“ The fact is,” Feathers admitted, impressively,
“his missus makes him wear red flannel binders.”
“They’re very sustaining,” said Goudy,
encouragingly.
“ Yes, but bli’me, a bloke in flannel binders
ain’t properly weaned ; ’n’ I cud just cry over pore
ole Levi there with binders gnawin’ inter his
vitals.”
“ Here,” cried Goudy, tremulously, “don’t you
give way or you’ll have me crying, too.”
Benno blubbered.
Goss hastened to reassure them, but he would
not tell the true story of his sorrow.
Within ten minutes the whole factory was in
possession of the legend of Levi’s sorrow, and the
Beauties were enjoying it with undisciplined
rapture like the barbarians they were. It was
a new theme, but it did not divert attention from
the trousers, which seemed to develop fresh
possibilities in the way of low comedy every day,
and at length Levi approached Feathers on the
subject.
“ I say,” he said, with the faintest suggestion
of impatience, “is there anythin’ wrong about
my trousers ? ”
“Yer trowsis!” ejaculated Feathers, with
surprising self-control.
“Yes, what’s against them ! ”
The packer examined the clothes with a judicial
air, as if his attention had now been called to
them for the first time.
“I dunno,” he said, “they seem to be a orl
right pair o’ pants, of sound constitution, ’n’ not
too saucy. Hi, Benno! ” The clerk climbed
down from his desk, and joined in the inspection.
“You don’t see nothin’ irreg’lar about Goss’s
trowsis, do yer?” continued Feathers. “Jest
have a look at ’em, ’n’ give us yer unbiassed
opinion.”
“They’re the pink!” said Benno, warmly.
“T’ tell you struth, if I have showed any envy
of Goss it’s on account o’ them garments.”
Feathers called the Fat Girl, and she came
readily. “ Goss here, he’s a bit put out over his
pants,” said the packer. “Thinks perhaps they
ain’t the height iv ambition in their way.
Speakin’ ez a hexpert, what’s yer candid
opinion of ’em, Miss Rickards?”
“ If Mr. Goss hadn’t been so cold to me I’d ’ve
asked him fer a pattern off ’em fer pa,” said
Martha, almost sadly.
“’Old ’ard a bit, ’n’ I’ll whistle up the guv’ner,
’n’ we’ll hear what a really great mind thinks
about ’em.” Feathers pulled the plug out of the
speaking-tube, and blew a blast. “Is Mr.
Odgson in his office ? Y’ might ask him t’ step
upstairs fer a moment. Goss is in great distress
o’ mind about his trowsis —wants counsel’s opinion
respectin’ the fit o’ the keel ’n’ the hang iv the
basque.”
“No, no, no, no !” wailed Goss. “It doesn’t
much matter. You mustn’t disturb the pro-
prietor.” He fled back to his bench, and flurried
a thousand envelopes on to the floor.
* * * *
But Levi Goss was not destined to remain long
in Spats’ factory. One afternoon, eight or nine
days later, a short, stout, neat-looking Metho-
distical woman of about 30, with a very business-
like expression in her eye, came up the back stairs
and stood for a moment regarding Levi Goss
silently, severely. Levi’s work slid from his hand ;
he cowered under the stern gaze like a criminal.
Feathers, looking from one to the other, whistled
down the scale.
“ Gossie’s sorrer, fer a dollar! ” he said.
The woman advanced to Levi. “So, Mr.
Goss, this is your quiet little job, is it?” Her
eyes went over the factory taking inventory of the
girls, and classifying them, and her lips tightened,
and her color rose. “You dissipated devil! ” she
hissed. “You abominable rake! you have de-
ceived me. This is why you have lied to me.”
“ ’Pon my soul, Louisa, I ” Levi’s attitude
was humble, but the woman cut him short;
“Yes,” she cried, “you are in your element
here with all these hussies, you wretch. Oh, but
you shall pay for this.” Nobody seeing Louisa’s
face could doubt it for a moment. “To think
after all the care I have taken of you, you should
have been here unwatched, unguarded. You
brute, I’ll divorce you.”
The truth dawned upon the factory. Louisa
was jealous—jealous of her Levi. It seemed too
utterly grotesque, but there was no doubting it.
Bella Coleman had marked the word “ hussies.”
and the contemptuous flashes in Louisa’s grey
eyes, and she approached diffidently with an
anx'ous expression, seeking vengeance.
“ Who—who are you, woman?” she asked in
ago-used Theatre Royal accents.
“lam this man’s wife, that’s who lam!” said
Louisa, fiercely.
“Great Heavings!” gasped Bella, staggering.
“Great Heavings; and he never told us he was a
married man.”
Then she passed on with bowed head and a
faltering step, the picture of a blighted life.
Louisa turned on Goss, and for half-a-minute
she was speechless. Then she seized him by the
shoulder. “Get your coat!” She dragged him
from his bench, and Levi lurched away to the
dressing-room, Louisa retaining her grip. He
returned presently with his coat, and Louisa,
with her relentless clutch upon him, pushed him
before her down the stairs. She pushed him all
the way, never relaxing her hold for a moment.
Feathers, leaning over the rail, watched them
down in a dazed way, with the feeling of a man
who has seen the last possibility of human folly.
Then he straightened himself and addressed the
factory.
“Levi’s a giddy,” he said. “He’s a rake, a
bloomin’ Henry the Eight. ’N in them trowsis
too ! ”
But he had not seen the last of Levi Goss. I T e
came up to the top flat again next day with his
wife in charge. Louisa stood aside, wearing a
grim, unbelieving expression, while her husband
set about clearing his character.
“I’m in an awful mesa, Mr. Mills,” he said to
the packer, “and you’re a good chap, you’ll help
me. See, my missus, she’s ’orribly jealous o’ me,
and I didn’t care to tell her I was workin’ in the
same room with a pack o’ girls, and now she
thinks I’ve bin carryin’ on, and—and I didn’t get
a wink o’ sleep all last night. ’Twas bad enough
when I got my clothes dirty, but now it’s some-
thin’ awful.” A tear rolled down Levi’s cheek.
Feathers took the matter in hand with judicious
gravity. He assured Mrs. Goss that her husband’s
conduct had been most exemplary during his stay
in the factory, that he had been blind to beauty
and deaf to the voice of the tempter. He pro-
duced witnesses in proof, Bella Coleman among
the rest, and this young lady admitted that Goss’s
not having told her he was a married man might
reasonably have been ascribed to the fact that he
had never spoken to her at all. “ I wouldn’t have
one like him if they gave ’em away with a gold
mine,” added Miss Coleman, with convincing
emphasis.
Levi looked happier as he went away, and
Feathers called a bit of advice after them.
“Take it from me, missus,” he said, “give the
man a charnce. Let him buy his own trowsis.”

WHEN you are bilious, every thought of food is nauseous. When the
room gets warm you feel as if you are going to be sick, If you hurry
to catch a car or a train, there the feeling is again. Headaches,
turning off with sickness, a nasty coated tongue, are other symptoms of Bilious-
ness, and a symptom most distressing to the
female sex is the fearful green-yellow color which
the face comes to have if Biliousness is allowed
to continue. All this arises from misdirected
bile, which is due, primarily, to improper liver
action. This is proved by the case of Mr.
Homan Rice, photographer, of 207 Walkeiv
street, Redfern, Sydney, who says:—“Fora
number of years I was subject to severe attacks
of Biliousness, and was at times quite prostrated,
and unable to attend to my business. I tried
various medicines, but gained little benefit from
any of them. Some time ago, when explaining
my trouble to a friend, he advised me strongly
to take a course of Bile Beans, as he could
speak from personal experience of their efficacy
in such cases. I followed this advice and
gained considerable benefit, in fact, since that
time, I have never had those prostrating attacks.
I can, therefore, with confidence recommend
Bile Beans to fellow sufferers,”

The White Patrol.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THEIR white line marks the bar
From the headland to the spit,
And they bear the shock and jar,
Of waves that come from far
To batter and beat on it.
They keep the clamoring seas
Out of tin quiet port,
Shouldering them with a casual ease,
Pleased with the giant sport.
And fhe restless, clattering channel bel
Cries to the ships
With iron lips,
“Well, all’s well.”
Rung by the pulse of the watchmen white,
Who pace so warily all the night.
The harbor lies as still
And clear as a land-locked lake—
Soarcely a ripple athrill
Or a capful of wind to spill
And make the ripples break,
Yet over the bar where the great seas march
There is battle, riot and rout,
There billows charge and topple and arch,
And the watchmen drive them out,
Stemming the rush of the ocean swell,
While the anchored ships
Hear raucous lips
Crying, “All’s well.”
In silver harness they tramp and roll—
The stalwart, swaggering White Patrol.
They are the sea police^
These waves of the harbor mouth.
Their vigils never cease—
Striving for order and peace
With the lawless seas from the south.
Marching from beach to the headland’s gloom—
Giant policemen they,
Sending the seas to hammer and boom
On cliffs that drip with spray ;
With always their cheerful message to tell—
From salt-white lips
To the anxious ships,
“Well, all’s well.”
A stormy night and a nasty sea—
Patrolling the bar so constantly.
When there is peace on the deep
And stars in the heaven’s arch,
The White Patrol snatch sleep,
Leaving look-outs to keep
A watch on their ceaseless march—
Scouts who will call at the smallest sign,
“ Ho there, sleepers, awake 1 ”
And the White Patrol is a steadfast line
When the first long rollers break,
Charging the clattering channel-bell.
As it leaps and dips,
To shout to the ships,
“Well, all’s well !”
And the captains, safe in the inner mole,
Hear the crashing march of the White Patrol,
MAORILAND,
WILL LAWSON.
Willie’s Day.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LITTLE WILLIE SMYTHE got up
bright and early orte fine summer morning,
His real name was Smith, but his papa
and mamma did not consider that sufficiently dis-
tingui, which Mrs. Smi—l mean Smythe—called
“distangay,” because the dictionary, made in
England, told her to. Willie shovelled his
clothes on, beginning with his shirt, which came
from England, and forgetting to tie up the laces
of his boots, which came from America. He
crumpled his collar putting it on. This collar
Was really made in Australia, and was a good one
fts collars go. But it was labelled “ Made in Eng-
land,” because you can sell things better to Aus-
tralians if you tell them that the thirigs Were
manufactured in the “Dear Old Mother Country.”
Perhaps the sea voyage improves them.
, Willie went down to breakfast. He ate it off a
plate made in England ; this plate stood on a
table made in Australia, but by a Chinaman, The
Sugar he would never have had, had it not been for
a nice kind person named Tanna, who could work
for 6d. a week and two old Shirts a year, where
White men impudently asked enough to live on.
Lbfc them take a lesson from Tanna. He doesn’t
Want to live, he is satisfied with existence. The
ttluttOh was certainly Australian, so Was the
bread. But then anybody can grow wheat or
watcn §heep. Making tables, however, is intel-
lectual work, So we must get Chinamen to do
that. They also are skilled at living upon nothing,
and they do not Waste their money upon soap.
Yes, they are very patient and saving. We ought
to love the dear Chinamen, who make tables for
us, and the nice Hatters who make copy for the
newspapers.
Willie went to school in a suburb called
Lewisham—a real English name, Upon the walls
of the schoolroom hung a map of Germany, one of
South Africa, and One of New South Wales.
Willie had heard of Victoria, but there was no
map of it on the walls, because all men who lived
in Victoria were wicked, and when they died
Would assuredly go to Hell for “ entrapping ’’New
South Wales. When Willie arrived that day at
School the teacher was picking out the mistakes
in the reading book, and telling the class that
that was the worst of Australian books. They
never make mistakes in England. Nor in Japan,
nor in Germany, nor France, nor America, nor
No—only in Australia. And not,
mind you, because Australia lacks nice, kind, fat
critics, who tell her (and everybody else) when
she makes mistakes. She has any amount of
them. But she will not learn that hatters, and
excluded Indian fellow-subjects, and Petriana
niggers are “blots upon her escutcheon,”
whatever that may be. Indeed, some of her
?apers call her kind critics “Stinking Fish.”
think the editors of these must be very wicked,
and I suppose they do not go to the church (of
England, or Scotland, or Rome).
On his way home Willie looked into the shop
windows and saw all the nice things which came
from over the sea for the use of Australians,
because, of course, they don’t know how to make
these things themselves. The grocer had jams
from England, and cheeses from Holland, and
tinned beef from America, and condensed milk
from Switzerland, and figs from 'Turkey, and
macaroni from Italy, and prunes from France,
The pretty silks in the drapers’ shops came from
Japan, the muslin from India, the woollens from'
England or Germany. Of course we have quite a
lot of sheep in Australia, but we cannot make up
the wool, and many people think we never will be
able to. English people must be very much
cleverer than we are. At any rate, when they
come here they admit that they are, so it is per-
haps true.
Then Willie pondered over the shine on the
American boots in the next shop. And how thick
that English leather was. As thick as the head
of Willie’s papa, although, of course, this compari-
son did not strike his son. He went into a lolly-
shop where they sold English,. French, and Swiss
chocolate, Scotch toffee, Turkish delight, Bul-
garian rock, and American candy. There he
bought a pennyworth of Australian lollies. He
swallowed them whole, and they made him sick ;
which served him right for not encouraging the
foreign importer. Before he got sick, however, he
looked in at the top-shop, and purchased a mon-
key-on-a-stick, made in Germany.
Then, the sickness coming upon him, he fled,
weeping, home, and had a mustard plaster (made
in England) -put upon his little bel—er—chest
(made in N.S. W.). It cured him sufficiently to
restore his appetite, and he made a large meal of
tinned salmon from Canada and canned fruit from
California.
After tea, Willie’s papa pulled out of one
pocket of his imported waistcoat a toothpick,
made in America, and out of the other a cigar,
which he told mamma was “none of your Balmain
Stinkadores, but a real Havannah.” Willie
thought it smelled very nasty, like black men on
a hot day. I believe they lick the leaves to finish
off; perhaps this was the reason of the nasty
smell. But we cannot roll cigars in Australia,
even if we import the tobacco, because we are not
so clever as black men. Although we do wash
ourselves sometimes.
Then Willie’s papa went out to see an English
play called “The Tooth at the Keyhole.” He
came home very late, long after mamma came
back from the Women’s Liberal League reception
to George Reid and his dear little dog. The
theatres close very late. And papa, though Willie
did not know this, and mamma only guessed one-
half of it, had been drinking Jamaica rum and
Scotch whisky and English beer at the American
bar. When he came out of there he met a pretty
French lady with a long feather in her hat, and
took her to supper at a fish-shop kept by a
Greek. So it was three o’clock before he came
home, helped by a Spanish policeman named
Hogan. Willie opened one eye, and hoped that
when he grew up he would be like his Freetrade
papa. Then he fell asleep again and dreamed
that he was stealing bananas, from Fiji, out of the
basket of a yellow person named Ho Cat, who
came from Hongkong in a boat commanded by a
Dutchman and built in America.
HOWARD ASHTON.
The Yellow Mongrel in His
Kennel.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Londonderry, September i4th.-
I’m not much on religion as a rule, but
for the second time in my life I have an
uncomfortable feeling that environment would
have made me a miserable fanatic. First time
was in the unctuous, Sabbatical Maoriland city of
Dunedin, where a couple of years spent in the
middle of the constant wrangle about piety left
me something between a wreck and an agnostic.
A subsequent ten years’ battle as newspaper scribe
left no time for Heavenliness of any sort, and yet,
here in Derry, with “Roaring Meg ” poised upon
the battlements close to a purloined Cathedral and
many other monuments of the Yellow Mongrel, I
feel that within six months Bigotry in all its
bitterness would lay hold on me. The com-
modious whining of Saint Pup would make me
want to throw bricks at his halo.
If literal squalor argues moral uncleanliness,
then Derry is just about as unclean a place as any
of its size could be. It seems to have no muni-
cipal order, and humans dwell with porkers in the
hovels of its main thoroughfares. Slops and
ordure are thrown out of the front doors, and all
is filth. So much time has been spent in remem-
bering the Siege and other things that were just
as well forgotten, that nobody has thought of
keeping the streets clean or fixing up a proper
drainage system.
Consider the hungry jowl of the Yellow Animal.
Every mouth in this city has the downward twist
of a bilious temperament. Even the adherents of
Rome are not the wide-visaged people you meet
in the Southern counties. Through their habit of
barking back they have assimilated many of the
characteristics of the Pup, their enemy. Come to
review the whole matter, Dill Macky is the only
Orangeman I’ve ever seen who seemed to thrive
in body.
In the hotels here, every bedroom is con-
spicuously supplied with a copy of the Bible. In
the waiting-rooms at railway stations, and on the
dismal hoardings, are scribbled thousands of filthy
and virulent references to the Pope. There is
one set of newspapers for the Williamites, and
another for the Patrick crowd ; with two different
sets of shops for selling them in. T’other day,
Cardinal Logue made some vigorous remarks in
the neighborhood of Belfast. Not a solitary line
of report appeared in the Billy papers in either
Belfast or Derry, although the speech was
chronicled verbatim by the Patrick press. Space
in the former was devoted to four columns about
P.G.MJs and G. Chaplains and G.T.’s.
Just now an election contest progresses in
Belfast, the candidates being a pretentious old
Bumble with many yellow hieroglyphs and a
sorry Labor representative who has also con-
sidered it necessary to hang on to the tail of the
jaundiced hound. (Note how cronk politicians
always associate with poodles—Reid cultivates a
Dry one and a Yellow one.) Political claims in
this election rest entirely on the contention that
one man isn’t quite as yellow as the other.
And before me is a Patrick paper which gives
the full text of a report by the chief of the Royal
Irish Constabulary on an alleged outrage against
a Pup follower, who said he had been fired at
through the window of his domicile, and that a
green desperado had stuck a written warning on
his back fence. Experiments by the police proved
that the shot could only have been fired from
inside the Yellow person’s own premises, and
that the alleged warning had been written in his
own study, dried on his blotting-pad, and nailed
up some days after the alleged shooting, with the
object of lending versimilitude to a very thin
statement. The William journals have pigeon-
holed this document, but the Patrick papers are
making remarks.
There are still snakes in Ireland.
THOROLD DLRYMPLE.


We take pleasure in publishing the following Ihp
terestfng letter from Mr. James Sumers, who also
very k'ndly sends his photograph;
“Indigestion and liver complaint
troubled me greatly, and the money I
spent on various medicines was only
wasted, as they did me no good. A
friend asked me why I did not take
I thought that if I did the result would
be the same as with the other medi-
cines; but, to my groat surprise, after
taking a few doses I felt really better,
and I continued until I had taken, in all,
seven or eight bottles. I was then able
to digest my food, and it made me feel' Rke a,new man. I now always
bore with me a supply of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.” Jambs Sumers, North
Terrace, Adelaide, S. A.
Of course you cannot enjoy good health if your stomach gives out.
You must have an appetite, must digest your food, and must keep
your liver active. Muscular strength, nervous strength, desire to be
active, and a feeling of general good health may be yours by keeping
your liver active and your blood pure. Ayer’s Sarsaparilla strengthens
the stomach and aids digestion.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla will do all this for you, but
you must insist upon getting “AYER’S,” for it is
stronger, contains more valuable ingredients, and
cures more quickly than any other kind.
