Service
No two men ever lived to win fame
who differed more on the surface than
the subjects of these biographies. One
was inspired by hate, the other by ben-
evolence. One was gregarious, the other
quarrelsome. The list might be extended
for a page or so ; yet they were alike
under their skins. Both fanatical re-
formers and desperate workers; both
filled with indignation over the hard lot
of the poor; both dedicated to what the
Rotarians call “service.” As a student of
17 at the Trier Gymnasium, Karl Marx
wrote:
History regards as great men those who
ennoble themselves by working for the
common good. Experience distinguishes
as the happiest him who makes most men
happy.
It is very like what Robert Jones might
have written at the same age.
An Embittered Bourgeois
A fundamental of the Marxist faith is
that every mode of thought is the pro-
duct of the social conditions of the age
in which it was born. Marx himself was
a product of his age and environment.
There is plenty of evidence in E. H.
Carr’s Karl Marx (J. M. Dent; 12s. 6d.)
that in happier financial circumstances
the father of modern revolution might
have been a furious Tory. All he asked
of life was something to be furious about.
The circumstances of his birth made him
as inevitable an international as if he
had belonged to a contemporary royal
family. His father, Hirschel Marx, was
a Rhineland Jew who, as a subject of
the last Archbishop-Elector of Trier, had
become a Frenchman. From middle-age
Hirschel was a Prussian, and he married
a Jewess of German origin whose family
had ; settled in Holland. They had all
been baptised as Christians, and they be-
longed to the petty bourgeoisie.
Prussian departmentalism—expressed
in an idiotic censorship and in minor
tyrannies, such as edicts forbidding the
collection of dead wood by impoverished
peasants—first aroused hatred of capital-
istic tyranny in Marx’s pugnacious bosom.
He scarified the Prussian Government in
the “Rheinische Zeitung.” Then he
turned on his colleagues on this the only
radical paper in Prussia at the time, and
scarified them for not having moved as
far to the Left as he had. His subsequent
career consisted of a series of clashes
with authority and with his friends,
which eventually landed him an almost
friendless refugee in London.
The England of 1849 provided him
with all the evidence he needed for his
indictment of Capitalism. He got it from
Public Health Reports and other Blue
Books in the British Museum ; for he
knew nothing to the end of his days
about working-class life from personal
experience. He was an unhappy outcast
•—as he imagined the typical proletarian
to be—and he hated democrats equally
with aristocrats. His aim was to free
the proletariat from its supposed miseries
so that it might be tyrannised over for
its own good by someone like himself.
It is strange that, though no rational
person now accepts the labor theory of
value which formed the starting-point of
Marx’s system, and. though time has
proved the absurdity of his belief that
workers who failed to start violent
revolutions would always be ground
down, yet his “Manifesto” of 85 years
ago is still the basis of every Communist
manifesto. The one that has just been put
out in England by the Cripps-Trevelyan
party is almost identical with his in the
essentials.
Marx was one of those brilliant men
who are wholly incapable of supporting
themselves. This biography, which is an
attempt to interpret him rather than his
theories, gives attractive pictures of his
happy home life and of the only
friend he ever kept. His fellow-Com-
munist Engels helped him and the family
during their early years in London, and
towards the end supported them alto-
gether. Engels did more than supply
Marx with money;
he wrote most of
the articles which
were nominally
contributed by the
sage to the New
York “Tribune.”
Marx emerges from these impartial
pages as an authoritarian, ready to attack
anybody (including his benefactor Engels)
who differed from him in the least
degree ; a visionary with a mission to
save the poor from their oppressors; a
loving husband and father and the pos-
sessor of all the domestic virtues. He
had pointed out in “Das Kapital” that
under the bourgeois order children were
forced to work in mines; that a Com-
munist order was the alternative; and
that Communism would not be achieved
till the proletariat had become inter-
nationally class-conscious. He could not
foresee that, on the one hand, sweating
would eventually be ended by bourgeois
votes, and that, on the other, a spirit of
nationalism was about to appear which
would manifest itself more strongly in
internationalist States than in any others.
His gospel has caused rivers of blood
to flow already, and may cause further
rivers to flow in the future, while the
proletariat is no better off than it would
have been if he had never lived. Yet
he was a great man, and, according to
his lights, a good one.
Favorite of Fortune
The Life of Sir Robert Jones (Hodder
and Stoughton ; Dymock’s; 12s. 6d.) is
the work of the famous orthopaedist’s
son-in-law Frederick Watson. If the
hero of this glowing tale had any seri-
ous weaknesses they are not revealed;
the narrator is a worshipper, as, indeed,
most people were who came in contact
with Jones.
He was lucky in being apprenticed,
after graduating as a doctor, to his uncle,
Dr. Owen Thomas, of Liverpool. Thomas
belonged to a long line of bone-setters,
and Jones soon learned to combine the
tricks of this ancient English trade with
modern surgery. There was nothing
particularly eventful about his career;
from his appointment at an early age
as consulting surgeon to the Manchester
Ship Canal, where he had 20,000 workers
to look after, he moved from one re-
sounding success to another. Before
the war it happened that he was rather
more renowned in the U.S.A. than in
his own cpuntry. Liverpool is nearer in
ways to New York than it is to London.
It was the war that made Robert Jones
one of the Empire’s idols. Orthopaedic
surgery came into its own before the
fighting had been in progress for a year,
and in 1916 he was able to establish the
Shepherd’s Bush Military Orthopaedic
Hospital. The Royal College of Sur-
geons, the last trench of orthodoxy, was
still hostile, but, in view of the results
which he and his pupils—American and
Dominions as well as British—were
obtaining, it yielded and elected him a
Fellow in April, 1918. Everything and
everybody yielded to him in the end.
Far greater than his skill and his
phenomenal energy and capacity for
work was his love of humanity. He
was no ascetic, and he delighted in
homely jokes and in various sports, but
his mission was to help the unfortunate.
All his sympathies were with what Marx
called the proletariat, and more especi-
ally with proletarian children in ill-
health. “Marx,” says Mr. Carr, “had
always been a success with children, and
reserved for them the tenderness which
was so conspicuously lacking in his inter-
course with the rest of mankind.” Sir
Robert Jones also “had always been a
success with children.” His goodwill
towards the rest of mankind was no
greater probably than that of Marx. The
basic difference was that he came of “a
different age and environment.”

HEAT is Australia s main cereal crop, with an average pro-
duction tor the past five years of 180 million bushels. The value
of wheat and flour exported during the five years 1929 to 1933
totalled £lO4 million, or nearly £2l million per annum.
Toward the production, sale and return of proceeds of this
great crop, the banks of Australia have contributed assistance in
various forms. Money has been advanced for cultivation and
sowing, reaping and carting. The large amount represented by
export sales has been financed, and collected from many countries
and in various currencies, and brought back to Australia or used
to meet our annual obligations overseas. The growers' proceeds
of sales have been distributed through the banks to all sections
where wheat is produced.
The National Bank provides a full range of services covering
the financial requirements of producers and of merchants—both for
the local and oversea sections of trade.

harbored by any human bosom. Yet
the professor is simply a German who
has been conditioned by his upbringing
to believe in national self-preservation.
He is addressing an audience which has
been similarly conditioned. Therefore
his book is a revealing human document.
Here is the passage which has aroused
the greatest horror:
It gives us pleasure to meditate on the
destruction that must sooner or later over-
take this proud and seemingly invincible
nation [England], and to think that this
country, which was last conquered in
1066, will once more obey a foreign
master, or, at any rate, have to resign its
rich Colonial Empire.
Hitler probably holds the same opinion.
And who can blame him? All the
Powers rely on military strength for
survival, and all are engaged in a struggle
for world markets. It is not the job
of a professor of military science
to suggest economic or any other solu-
tions for this situation, and if his Gov-
ernment prefers the military solution it
is not his business to criticise it.
The professor, in fact, is brilliantly
objective. He gives England high praise
for her practice of the science of which
he is a distinguished exponent. He com-
pliments her whole-heartedly on her
astute use of the weapon of propaganda,
and he contrasts it with the fumbling
efforts of his own Government.
He is no more bothered about the
horrors of the next war than a surgeon
discussing the necessity—disagreeable to
the patient—of an operation. What he is
interested in is ways and means of get-
ting men to face the horrors.
In dealing with France he is similarly
objective. He considers that the back-
bone of the nation is the Germanic
element. Therefore,
ruthlessly conducted wars, which will
reduce the numbers of this French warrior-
caste; transportation of detachments of
them to an eastern Germany of the future,
where they would soon, become German-
ised; cross-breeding of those that remain
with southerners and negroes, in which
matter the French military authorities have
themselves shown the way; progressive
limitation of population—all these are
possible means to the decline and fall of
France.
Herr Banse is somewhat sentimental in
his belief that the peace of the world can
only be secured by German dominance;
but the same pious faith is held on the
other side of the Rhine. Some of his
information is faulty. Thus he rules
Australia out in the next war because in
the Commonwealth “Marxism is univer-
sal.”
F. S.
“Making Morality Modern”
G. W. R. Southern, the author of this
publication, mentions in a preface that
no printer would touch it, so he learned
the trade and printed it at home. The
Postal Department refused to register it
for transmission, but the department, he
says, “has no power to refuse transmis-
sion provided a book is sealed and pre-
paid as a letter.” Why his volume should
have been discriminated against is a
mystery ; it says nothing that isn’t to be
found in imported books which are on
sale everywhere.
He sent a questionnaire to Havelock
Ellis, Westermarck, Malinowski and
other famous men, and to No. 1 (“Do
you think the book obscene or in-
decent?”), they all answered “No” or
“Not in the least.” Professor Tansley,
of Oxford (author of “The New Psy-
chology”), added several helpful criti-
cisms.
I hold no brief for Traditional Christian
morals —quite the contrary—nor am I a
Christian believer But I do feel .that
if you reflect on the value of some of the
real Christian virtues you will write less
bitterly and contemptuously of religion
as a whole.
The authorities may have been influ-
enced by the fact that Mr. Southern is
a proselytising-Communist. He throws
some queer sidelights on the workings
of the Communist mind. He believes in
fre.e love. Admittedly monogamy suits
some people, but others find it galling.
There are many married women who
would like to be promiscuous. How-
ever, “You can’t expect a man to allow
his wife any real freedom while he has
to support all the little accidents she may
have.” A chapter on “Motherhood En-
dowment” follows naturally, in which it
is argued that the lady’s accidents should
be supported by the State. In other words,
that normal wives and their families
should go short by so much as their
husbands are taxed for the support of
the offspring of the others. Such an
inequitable arrangement could only be
made to work under a highly efficient
tyranny.
He writes in such a white heat of zeal
that it is difficult at times to identify
the arguments behind the adjectives. His
general purpose, however —to advocate
the principles of the World League for
Sexual Reform —is clear. The desir-
ability of many of the league’s planks
(race betterment, prevention of prosti-
tution and venereal disease, systematic
sexual education) is acknowledged even
by the Puritans and clericals whom he
scorns. An objection to most of the
other planks at the present stage of our
political development is that no free
country would stand them in practice.

Australasian Whaling
In Whalemen Adventurers (Angus and
Robertson ; 155.), Professor W. J. Dakin
tells how whaling in the southern seas
“helped in the foundation of the great
Dominions of Australia and New Zea-
land.” More than half the book is de-
voted to the genesis, development and
decline of the old deep seas (ship) and
longshore (bay) whaling, when men took
their lives in their hands as they went out
to draw forth Leviathan with a hook. It
is an intensely interesting tale, buttressed
with a tremendous bibliography and
worthily indexed.
The starting-point is the sailing of the
Enderby whaler Emilia from London, a
year or so after Phillip had landed at
Sydney Cove. Old Sam Enderby had had
to find ocean-pastures new when the
American colonies revolted and the
Atlantic fisheries were closed. All this
quarter of the world was then the pre-
serve of the East India Company, which
would not allow whaling under its mon-
opoly of trade in seas east of the Cape.
But Enderby was not to be thwarted. He
sent a ship into the Pacific via the Horn
—the first to explore the southern Un-
known. He wrote:
We have purchased and fitted out a
very fine ship at a great expense to go
round Cape Horn, she is now ready to
sail ; we are the only Owners intending to
send a ship on that Branch of the
Fishery.... On the success of our ship
depends the Establishment of the Fishery
in the South Pacific Ocean, as many
owners have declared they will wait until
they hear whether our ship is likely to
succeed there. If she is successful a large
Branch of the Fishery will be carried on
in those seas; if unsuccessful, we shall
pay for the knowledge.
She returned with a full cargo of sperm
oil.
In November, 1791, the Enderby ship
Britannia arrived at Port Jackson from the
Cape via Van Diemen’s Land. The cap-
tain (Thomas Melville), in a Letter to
“Old Sam,” mentions with pride that the
Britannia had killed the first four whales
ever killed off the coast of N.S.W. In
1793 20 whalers returned to England
from Pacific waters, “four of them com-
ing specifically from the N.S.W. coast.”
The whaling grounds, the life-history of
the whale, its varieties and habitations,
the ships, the crews, the equipments, the
cost, the methods of capture and the vari-
ous treatments of the catch, the condi-
tions created by the coming of the
whalers in all parts of the Pacific, inter-
national rivalries, glimpses of the great
personalities in the drama —all are dealt
with here. The book is beautifully got
up and fully illustrated.

the “frightful responsibility of advising
the 8.8. C. on the subject of spoken Eng-
lish,” is a law unto himself. He wrote
recently to the “Times” that “the short i
is much less effective than the long one —
issolate is a highly superior pronuncia-
tion —wind (rhyming to tinned) is con-
sidered more elegant in some quarters
than wynd, but we recommend the long
i to announcers for the sake of sonority”
—which all seems to me reedikkalus.
I doubt if even a British announcer
would have the courage to use Shaw’s
wynd in a weather talk.
The authority from Dublin declared
further that an announcer who used the
pronunciations dekkadent and sonnerus
would provoke Providence to strike him
dumb. To which someone replied that
if the fate suggested were enforced upon
all who accent the first syllable of de-
cadent it would make all England dumb.
Paradoxically, Shaw refers to the Eng-
lish habit of attacking the first syllable
(Fowler calls it recessive accent), and
says that “superior persons” (including
himself) say dissputable, labratory,
ecksmplary and desspicable. Some of
these pronunciations are impossible to
the tongue, and it is good to know that,
out of deference to the many “respect-
able” members of the “new human
species called listeners-in” who prefer the
alternatives, they are not enforced.
Announcers’ English in England bids
fair to become another dialect. The
absence of dialects in Australia makes a
standard speech easier, but all the dic-
tionaries and wireless announcers in the
world won’t prevent several million good
Australians from discussing the coming
Melbourne centenary. Fowler (“Modern
English Usage”) counsels wisely: “Pro-
nounce as your neighbors do, not better ;
for words in general use your neighbor
is the general public.” Shaw, for all
his brilliance, talks so much that he
might be considered by certain special-
ists on the air a wyndbag.
VAL.
A Satchel of Books
Tooth and Talon, by Henry G.
Lamond (Angus and Robertson; 6s.),
is just what the title suggests. The author
has an intimate knowledge of Australian
animals and birds, and gives vivid de-
scriptions of their modes of living and
mating. He deals with brumbies,
dingoes, kangaroos, emus, cattle, walla-
roos, wedge-tailed eagles, wild pigs,
crocodiles and goannas in that order.
Even those who rarely leave a city will
be able to see with the eyes of their
minds the hunts for food which are dealt
with here ; also the desperate battles for
the lordship of mobs, in which the loser
loses all.
The Portcullis Room, by Valentine
Williams (Hodder and Stoughton;
Dymock’s; 7s. 6d.), is a first-class
thriller, with an old castle in the
Western Hebrides as a background.
The interest depends, not on the murder
or its solution, but on the queer
people who are gathered together
in this remote and eerie spot while a
storm lashes the windows and the young
American millionaire grows to love the
laird’s daughter, and vice versa. The
man who got it in the back was a con-
genital murderee, and -the reader, how-
ever right-thinking, will find it hard to
feel sorry when the wielder of the laird’s
dagger escapes in the last chapter.
The Life of Fred Archer, by E. M.
Humphris (Hutchinson; 2s.). The best
biography of any jockey that this critic
has read. It traces Archer’s career from
his birth in Cheltenham (where his father
had a livery stable) to his funeral. As
showing the detailed manner in which
this curious and absorbing compilation
of facts has been carried out, the chapter
on the funeral contains not only a de-
scription of the obsequies and a list of the
important people who were present, but
many letters of sympathy. From one of
the letters which arrived after the
funeral: —
I went with H.R.H. [the Prince of
Wales, afterwards Ed. VII.] to the cemetery
this morning; he was so interested in the
grave and the flowers, and remained by
it just quarter of an hour.
It is all in that simple and human vein.
There is an invaluable 20-page index
which contains the name of practically
every notable sportsman of the Victorian
era.
The answers given to critics of the
R.C. faith over Station 2SM by the Rev.
Dr. Rumble, M.S.C., of Sydney, have
been compiled by the mission to which
he belongs and published in an ornate
volume entitled Radio Replies. The book
has a social as well as a religious interest.
About half the subjects dealt with are
those which crop up in what may be
called kerbstone controversies.
Q.: Must not the Pope always be an
Italian?
A.: No. Hadrian IV. was an English-
man ; Martin IV. a Frenchman; Zachary
a Greek; Gregory 111. a Syrian; Hadrian
XI. a Dutchman.
Maria Monk, Sister Liguori, Father
Chiniquy, Freemasonry, Socialism and
hundreds of other lay problems are dis-
cussed. An attractive feature of the
answers is their terseness.
The introduction to Tex Harding's
The Devil’s Drummers (Elkin Mathews
and Marrot; 7s. 6d.), written by the
translator, James Murphy, and telling
briefly of Harding’s life, is the best part
of the book. Harding ran away from
home in Austria when he was four-
teen, became a sailor, a prospector, a
pearl-fisher, a miner in Peru, a wanderer
in Brazil and a captain in the army of a
Mexican revolutionary. His book is an
account of a journey he made into the
interior of Brazil in 1929 in search of
Fawcett, who was lost there in 1925.
He had a companion and flew a hydro-
plane, using islands in the Amazon as
bases. They found few traces of Faw-
cett, but brought back an Indian girl
from whose story they concluded that he
was dead.
Tarzan is again among the fireside
adventurers who love him—subduing
animals by the power of his eyes ; slay-
ing lions single-handed; rescuing cap-
tives from the clutches of mysterious
white tribes who have been isolated for
upwards of 2000 years in Central Africa.
Those who favor quick action, hair-
breadth escapes and rapid romance can’t
do better than read Edgar Rice Bur-
roughs’s Tarzan Triumphant (John Lane ;
7s. 6d.).

“WOOL SALES POSTPONED.”
The wool situation is another warning
that Australia is depending too much on
exports of a few commodities, principally
wool.
In 1931-32 we sold our butter and our
wheat (low as the price was) for more
than in 1927-28, a good year ; but there
was a 51 p.c. cut in the annual wool
cheque. So nearly 30 p.c. of unionists
were out of work, and as many or more
were on rationed time. What would
have happened had the wheat and dairy-
produce returns shrunk as did the wool
income scarcely bears thinking about.
Export figures for 10 months of the
present financial year are significant:

Specie .. 84,956,000 101,950,000 +16,994,000
An increase of nearly £17,000,000 Aus-
tralian looks good ; but it all came from
wool. If wool, with the same out-
put, were to decline 20 p.c. in price
next season, it would be a very bad thing
for Australia. Local authorities think it
will not decline, but there has been a
downward tendency for three months,
and, because of Continental embargoes,
the market has suddenly become re-
stricted to a point which called for the
cancellation of sales —sales which were
confidently expected to yield £2,000,000
at least. Sales arranged for later dates
have also gone by the board. It looks
as if the next wool on the open market
will be that which starts the new series
of sales at the end of August.
Another fact cannot be neglected.
Wool tops usually slip a bit in May. In
the worst depression winters they proved
a level indicator for the new season’s
market. They fell sharply in May and
June, 1929, immediately preceding the
slump, and rose phenomenally before the
general recovery last year. They are
down again this year, and Bradford
figures are not pleasant to contemplate.
In May, 1929, there was a drop of 3d.
in 64’s on a 43d. market; between May
3 and June 7, 1934, one of 6d. on a
374-d. market.
The trade remains optimistic. At the
end of May, despite the German em-
bargo, the N.S.W. Woolbrokers budgeted
for a sale of 13,500 bales per day during
the coming season up to Christmas,
“subject to any necessary reductions.”
Just before the German embargo was
extended, their official organ, while
acknowledging that there had been “very
disappointing sales in Melbourne,” re-
ported that the outlook was “rather en-
couraging.” The news that Germany,
which has bought more heavily this
season than the last, may go off the gold
standard, along with countries like Italy,
which have been buoyant purchasers,
raised no fear.
W. P. Devereux, representative in Lon-
don of the Woolgrowers’ Council and
of the Graziers, said at the end of May
that “intense nationalism and disturbed
financial conditions” were “adversely
affecting the market,” but “the world
statistical position of wool” was “sound.”
So it is. There is no big carryover of
stocks in Europe, and the world supply
may dwindle for the 1934-35 season. But, if
statistical soundness controls prices, they
should have been much higher during
the depression. In some of the worst
years the quantity position was fairly
sound. The “Yorkshire Post,” perhaps
the best-informed daily on wool in the
world, says that “while the postponement
of the sales momentarily assists the posi-
tion, it does little to end the present un-
certainties.”
Australian Governments and news-
papers appear to be taking the matter just
as lightly as woolbrokers. Great Dailies
gave many columns to the Davis Cup
and Test matches, and a few lines to the
postponement of the wool sales. On the
day they were postponed, Mr. Parkhill,
for the Government, was engaged in nego-
tiations with public servants, who, hav-
ing been promised by Mr. Scullin that
their 1929 salaries would be restored, and
1929 pensions also, had come to see what
the Government was prepared to offer.
Speakers accused it of “having sold
them a pup,” and said they had been
“told by their members that their
methods were too orderly and quiet.”
Then came an “appeal,” followed by
something very like a threat.
We appeal to the Government to help
us out of our embarrassment. We desire
to proceed in an orderly way, and not
to indulge in wild talk, but we find it
difficult to withstand the employees’ de-
mands.
A Canberra telegram suggests that
£500,000 of the surplus will be devoted
to P.S. salary restoration.
If wool flopped to depression levels
again, many public servants would be
lucky to have salaries.
Whatever the effect on the elections, the
Commonwealth Government should make
no promise of public money to any dis-
satisfied section, whether public servants
or old-age pensioners, till it sees how the
new-season’s wool sells. Rather should
it discuss the situation with the State
Premiers and devise tax-relief measures
which, while easing the strain on indus-
try, will benefit public servants directly
and pensioners indirectly. If the current
optimism is justified, and the chief
national problems at the moment are
really how Woodfull will shape at Lord’s
and whether Dr. Earle Page will fight
Mr. Lyons in Tasmania, our Govern-
ments will be no worse off for having
prepared for possible trouble.
SHALL KILLERS GO FREE?
In Melbourne a man who, as it tran-
spired, had battered his first wife to
death with a hammer was found dead in
bed beside the corpse of his second wife.
Near them lay the bodies of their three
children ; all five had been done to death
with a razor. Police inquiries show that
both parents had been inmates of an
asylum, the father having been released
three years after he had been tried for
the murder of his first wife. He was
found not guilty on the ground of in-
sanity.
In Perth a man was charged with the
murder of his little son. The dreadful
fact was not disputed; but he was de-
clared “not guilty on account of un-
soundness of mind.”
Between the discovery of the bodies in
Melbourne and the delivery of the ver-
dict in Perth only a few hours elapsed.
The grim coincidence and the circum-
stances suggest that the power granted
to juries and asylum doctors to effect
the liberation of lunatics or alleged
lunatics who have taken life should be
withdrawn.
The wife-slayer and his second victim
were in the Mont Park mental hospital
together. They married a year after he had
left the institution. A condition of the
man’s release was that he should report
at stated intervals, and this he did for
three years; but after that he didn’t
bother, and the authorities didn’t bother
to bring him to book. According to Dr.
Jones, the Director of Mental Hygiene,
this was of no consequence, since “no
doctor could have detected symptoms of
returning insanity.” So on one impor-
tant phase of the subject of the crazy
killer —important to the public, at least —
medical knowledge is not precise.
Nothing could be more precise than
the statements of the medical witnesses in
the Perth case. A lady psychologist was
“convinced” that accused was in “a
state of temporary insanity” at the time
of the killing, having received a “blow
or a very severe shock” shortly before.
“I think he was quite unconscious of the
act he was doing,” said a doctor
from the Government Hospital for the
Insane: “I think the act was that of a
man insane at the time it was com-
mitted.” What ordinary witnesses think
is not evidence, but medical witnesses are
permitted to think, and their thoughts
are omnipotent in these matters, unless
other medical witnesses differ. None did in
this case, so an opinion formed after the
event concerning the mental condition of
a stranger cancelled all the positive
evidence for the Crown. As the Perth
“Mirror” puts it, “one sentence probably
saved Lawrence Oliver Mollor from the
gallows.”
The “very severe shock” was adminis-
tered by a public-house lady who had
written the man love-letters. Exercising
a privilege of her sex, she abruptly re-
jected him, and, as the theory went, this
so unhinged his mind that he went out
and stabbed his son. The woman’s part in
the case impressed the Chief Justice so
little that in his summing-up he scarcely
referred to it, though she had been kept
in the box for hours. But it evidently
impressed the jury, and the crowd in
the gallery was so worked up that it
cheered the verdict wildly, regardless of
his Honor’s rebuke —did everything, in
fact, but whistle “See the Conquering
Hero Comes.”
The verdict has placed the Westralian
Labor Government in a quandary. If,
as seems certain, Mollor is pronounced
sane at the first examination, it can
scarcely keep him in custody. Yet it
can’t let him out without wondering,
rather dismally, what use he will make
of his liberty and recalling notorious
cases in which the clemency of Labor
Governments was abused. An amend-
ment of the criminal law is patently
required. “Not guilty on the ground of
insanity” should be struck off the list of
permissible verdicts in murder cases.
Morons who have gratified homicidal im-
pulses should be consigned to a place
where they are not likely to gratify them
again. And asylum doctors should be
deprived of the power to set them free.
Asylum doctors render eminent services
but are fallible like the rest of their pro-
fession and the rest of mankind.
“THE RIGHT OF PUBLIC
MEETING.”
Members of England’s Conservative-
Labor Government have been denounc-
ing the “un-English conduct” of the
Mosleyites towards the Communists who
tried to break up their London Olympia
meeting. The truth is that British crowds
have always been as ready as foreign
crowds to bash their political, religious
and other opponents. That there have
been no Peterloos or Gordon Riots for
many years is due, not to a change of
heart on the part of British mobs, but to
the presence of a disciplined police force,
controlled by resolute Governments and
backed by Foot and Horse Guards.
These were the factors which killed vir-
tually at birth the attempt to start a
general strike in 1926, and which have
reduced all the other Moscow-inspired
efforts at revolutionary violence to
futility.
There is obviously something in Mos-
ley’s broadcast allegation that Mr. Mac-
Donald and his colleagues “were ready
to take advantage of violence by Com
munists to discredit a section which is
opposed to their Government,” and that
“a campaign to break up Mosley meet-
ings had been planned weeks ahead.”
London is so organised for the preven-
tion of violence that if violence is threat-
ened Scotland Yard knows, and the
threats never come to anything worth
cabling about.
The Communists were simply repeat-
ing the tactics of intimidation employed
by the Skeleton Army of more than half
a century ago. The early Salvationists
were aware that their opponents had
organised to stop their meetings, but they
insisted on keeping to their programme.
The same magistrates who had ordered
them not to defy their opponents con-
victed them when they did. An appeal
to the Queen’s Bench Division led to a
celebrated decision:
What has happened here is that an un-
lawful organisation, the Skeleton Army,
has assumed to itself the right to prevent
the appellants and others from lawfully
assembling together, and the finding of
the Justices amounts to this, that a man
may be convicted for doing a lawful act
if he knows that his doing it may cause
another to do an unlawful act. There is.
no authority for such a proposition.
Not only are the members of the Mosley,
or any other, party entitled to hold meet-
ings, provided they don’t advocate ille-
galities, but it is the business of the
authorities to protect them from violence,
whether they want to be protected or not.
There is a suggestion that the Mosleyites,
who are notoriously every bit as eager
for fight as the Communists, asked to
be allowed to police the Olympia meet-
ing themselves. If the Government had
been sincere in its desire to obviate
trouble it would have received such a
request with the utmost suspicion, and,
instead of sending no police, it would
have allotted at least double the usual
quota.
The principle that public speakers who
don’t act in contravention of the law
are entitled to be heard needs to be
emphasised in Australia just now, when
another Federal election is approaching
and a flood of press-manufactured hate
is being unloosed on the lieges. A fore-
taste of what the Commonwealth may be
in for was supplied at the recent Federal
Labor party rally in Sydney Town Hall.
A proportion of the audience consisted
of Langsters who, though they would
manhandle anyone who created a dis-
turbance at a Lang meeting, make a prac-
tice, when an election is on, of disturb-
ing the other side’s meetings. If Langsters
can’t bear to listen to the views of their
opponents (and vice versa ) the remedy is
obvious: the objectors can stay away.
When police are present in sufficient
number (as they were at the Town Hall
meeting) Skeleton Army or basher-gang
tactics fail; but it is tolerably certain that
they will be employed at the Common-
wealth elections. If Government doesn’t
see that speakers are protected it is cer-
tain, in the present state of public feel-
ing, that the speakers’ supporters will
attend to the job themselves. And that
way lies a repetition of the riots which
have been scandalising England.
BROADCASTERS DON'T CARE.
“Licenses for B broadcasting stations,”
the “Commonwealth Year-Book” re-
marks, “are granted under conditions
which ensure satisfactory alternative pro-
grammes.” Satisfactory to whom?
They are called “licensed” stations now,
and there are 51 of them, all sending out
advertising programmes. Each pays a
fee of £25 p.a. There are upwards of
574,000 legal listeners, but, if the law
of averages is worth anything, few of the
stations at any one moment can reach
more than 10,000. Many whom they do
reach do not hear their programmes:
words and “music” are drowned in the
listeners’ own heartfelt curses. But this
does not worry “licensed” stations: and
why should it? They are out to get as
much as they can and give as little as they
can —they are there to sell advertising.
In the day’s work of 17 hours, one
“licensed” station gives an hour and a
half of locally produced “entertainment.”
If some of it is bad it is useless to chide
the entertainers.
As a rule, an actor is called in and
offered three to five guineas for a quarter
of an hour of comedy or tragedy, accord-
ing to the advertiser’s fancy, or it may
be half an hour. Under the regulations,
the advertiser may have the field four
minutes in each half-hour ; so the drama
opens with some raw stuff about liver pills
or toilet soap, which proceeds for two
minutes on end. Then comes the amuse-
ment, during which the “Don’t shoot the
cast” sign can be heard figuratively flap-
ping against the microphone. As the
actor-manager must find the play,
cut its dialogue down from three full
acts, provide the cast, pay any extra
royalties and incidental expenses and
take the responsibility for rehearsals, he
cannot.do much. Usually he grabs a
guinea or so for himself, and recruits
his helpers from ambitious flappers and
cockerels.
Sometimes a station itself stages the
advertising and pays performers. In one
authenticated case a fairly competent
youngster was paid 10s. gross for three
appearances. In such instances the
station provides the script, which
may be handed out ten minutes before
the actual show. A dramatic piece thus
maltreated sounded as if the players were
wandering in a dark forest interrupting
their text by bumping against trees.
Even where the actor provides and pre-
pares the play, it is rarely properly re-
hearsed. Microphone rehearsals are not
encouraged. No manager of a com-
mercial theatre could put a play on under
such conditions and get away with it;
but broadcasters don’t care. They are
licensed for three years, and are safe-
guarded against excessive competition.
The whole arrangement needs the at-
tention of the Government. For one
thing, there should be a fair scale of
minimum wages—the Broadcasting Com-
mission has one. Then periods of blatant
advertising should be limited. What
would happen to the “Argus” if it tried to
connect every paragraph in its bulky
columns with a boost for Bloggs’s corn
cure? It would certainly have to come
out without the intimation that it is
“registered at the G.P.0., Melbourne, for
transmission by post as a newspaper,” if
it survived long enough to suffer the
deprivation.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Tas. Labor In.
In retiring from politics, McPhee, the
one pre-depression Premier who escaped
defeat during the depression, did not
transmit his luck to his colleague Lee.
That gentleman, who has been three times
Premier, has lost the 2-to-l majority that
McPhee had. McPhee would have lost
most of it had he remained, but he
might have saved his party a seat in
Denison, where he topped the poll in
1931 and carried three Nationalists in
with him. And that would have made
the difference between hanging on and
going into opposition.
In the counting of preferences Propor-
tional Representation played tricks, as
it does so often. Carruthers, a Douglas
Credit man, squeezed in for Denison ;
Pearsall, who sat in the 1928-31 Parlia-
ment as an Independent, ousted the
Nationalist Seabrook in Franklin; and
Becker, who calls himself Federal Labor,
administered an unpleasant surprise to
the other Labor group (Ogilvie’s) in
Wilmot. None of the three got any-
where near the quota in the first count.
Lee has gone to the Loan Council as
head of the Government, but on his
return to Hobart A. G. Ogilvie will
become Premier, with 14 members in a
House of 30. The Nationalists (13) will
probably provide the Labor Government
with a Speaker, veteran John Evans hav-
ing been returned for Franklin ; but if
Ogilvie lasts a twelvemonth without hav-
ing to go to the country it will be an
achievement.
♦
Melbourne’s Sick Bays.
The breakdown of the conference called
in Melbourne to produce a policy to
save bankrupt hospitals was a foregone
conclusion. There are too many people
with separate axes to grind.
The small, ill-paid, debt-ridden practi-
tioner of the suburbs has no great incen-
tive to help city hospitals. He himself
does a great deal of eleemosynary work,
and he finds it harder and harder to
recoup himself from better-furnished
patients. A man will pay his tailor or his
grocer before he pays his doctor. More-
over, so many people have discovered
that they can get all the attention they
require at public institutions for nothing
or next to nothing that the small private
practitioner is slowly being squeezed out
of existence.
But this doesn’t make the situation any
better. The mass deficit of the leading
hospitals is £203,312, and still mounting.
A huge poster confronted the citizen
hurrying to his job along Swanston-street
to the effect that if the General Hospital
did not dredge another £75,000 out of
the public’s pocket it would have to close
its doors. The poster has gone, though
the deficit hasn’t gone with it.
All the hospitals have their auxiliaries,
whose devoted members play bridge,
organise whist drives and ping-pong tour-
naments and sell scones in a vain attempt
to catch up with the financial breakaway.
The community acts more sensibly in
regard to its other utilities. It has in-
vested several millions in the State pro-
vision of electric light and power, and
when the managers at Yallourn convince
it that it needs an extension it gets the
money somehow. If the S.E.C. were run
on the lines of the hospitals, the public
would wake up every second morning
to learn that half the city would be
plunged in darkness and half the dairies
in Gippsland deprived of current unless
Electricity Button Day failed to produce
the required amount. Such behavior
would be regarded by everybody as the
height of asininity, yet the community
could do without lights and movies with
far less discomfort and danger to itself
than if it were deprived of medical
facilities.
The Argyle Administration will have
to tackle the problem as a responsible
Government instead of a public cadger.
Westralia has a hospitals fund into
which go the receipts from a special
income tax of \\d. in the £. All persons
and companies in receipt of income are
liable, and in the cases of salary- and
wage-earners tax is deducted from their
pay. Victorians, Judge Winneke says,
shudder at the thought of increased taxa-
tion, but better a small hospitals tax than
the spectacle of great institutions turning
sick people away from their doors or
closing them altogether.

Superabundant Legislation.
The Sydney Corporation (Amendment)
Bill has reached the Leg. Council after
a stormy passage in the Assembly. It
contains just and necessary provisions,
but deals with so many subjects that it
looks like a new code of general muni-
cipal law. As Mr. Spooner complacently
announced when introducing it, “the bill
is divided into seventeen parts.” One
was enough.
The Civic Commission was abolished
100 soon. Except in one notorious respect,
the reconstituted council has drifted into
the old bad ways, and the atmosphere
resembles that of a savage tug-of-war.
The city is losing £300,000 a year on
resumptions made when borrowing was
easy and unlimited. Interest and ex-
change eat up three-fourths of the rates.
And recent manoeuvres regarding wages
suggest that control of the municipality
is again passing to the municipal
employees.
It is proposed to tie the hands of
squandermaniacs by restricting their
power to get money over the counter and
from the banks, and by making them
answer, as to loan flotations, to the
people who find the rates. It is proposed
also to do away with the doss-house
vote, which has had such evil results (on
the latest electoral lists there were more
lodgers than owners and nearly as many
as owners and lessees combined), and to
have an election at the end of the year
under an owner-lessee-occupier-returned-
soldier franchise, with preferential vot-
ing. Nothing more is necessary for the
time being. The Government should be
satisfied to get these features of the bill
accepted by the Leg. Council and let the
rest stand over.,

A Voice in the Wilderness.
Tucked away at the bottom of an
“Argus” column were half a dozen lines
reporting a speech by Fenton, M.H.R.,
who left the Labor party with Lyons.
He said that when a country was passing
through a crisis hearty co-operation
among all parties and the people was
more important than the narrow and
rigid discipline of party politics. He
would like to see a united Australia with
a national Government composed, as in
Britain, of representatives of all parties.
Politicians who read this heresy must
have gasped in astonishment. With them,
the fight is half the charm of political
life, and the secret caucus their refuge.
Yet S. Africa, as well as Britain, has a
national Government, composed of ele-
ments that seemed irreconcilable. Race
once divided them, and it is a stiffer
obstacle than party. Both these national
Governments are getting along pretty
well. Anyway, they have large surpluses
of which good use is being made, whereas
in previous bad years there were only
deficits under the party system.
In each of the Parliaments concerned
a few extremists sit on the Opposition
benches and snarl. But a good many of
those who used to snarl with them have
found that they can be just as critical
inside a Government party as out of
it without going to extremes and making
stable government impossible.
Mr. Lyons and Dr. Page should find
food for thought in Mr. Fenton’s
remarks if the Langsters and Federal
Labor won’t.

Demand for an Inquiry.
Last March The Bulletin revealed the
facts behind the suicide of Lieut.-Com-
mander Alan Casey, R.A.N. Since then
leading U.A.P. dailies have taken the
matter up. Now the Casey family’s
solicitors, Messrs. Heydon and McNevin,
of Sydney, have written to the Prime
Minister summarising The Bulletin’s
case, and concluding that it discloses
“excessively harsh treatment by the de-
partment of a brilliant naval officer.”
By overriding the recommendations of
the Naval Medical Board and of a civilian
specialist, the consulting naval physician,
the Naval Board acted with complete
indifference to the future welfare of the
deceased, who, by reason of his age and
specialised career, was unfitted for any
other calling without a long period of
training.
The solicitors are asking for a Royal
Commission.
Even had it been necessary in the inter-
ests of the service to retire the deceased,
the nature of his services and the cause of
his ill-health were such as to have entitled
him either to shore employment in the
Defence Department or to compensation
in an amount which, together with his
deferred pay, would have furnished him
with sufficient capital to train himself for,
and later commence, some other calling in
life.
Rear-Admiral Feakes, a member of
the Naval Board which rejected Casey’s
offer to retire in 1930 (when he would
have been entitled to compensation), has
said for publication that he assumes
there will be an inquiry by a Supreme
Court Judge, and that he is prepared to
give evidence before it on behalf of an
old shipmate, whose needless death he
deplores. Nothing stands in Mr. Lyons’s
way but his party machine. It remains
to be seen if he will defy it, and have
justice done.

Cancer and Treatment.
Subscribers to the Sydney University
Cancer Research Fund, which has had
£170,000 in gifts and investment returns
since 1926, will scarcely be satisfied with
the assurance of the Vice-Chancellor
that all is well with the organisation, and
that “cancer research is proceeding un-
interruptedly.”
Immediately after The Bulletin had
referred to the poor results obtained
under the late Dr. Chapman’s direction,
the committee asked for his resignation.
Dr. Wallace declares that this was done
wholly because of the. state of his health.
But for six months before this Dr. Chap-
man had rarely been seen in the Cancer
Research headquarters, and he had not
applied for sick leave.
Another feature of the Vice-Chancel-
lor’s statement is his defence of the Syd-
ney system of separating research from
treatment. A glimpse at the journals of
the University Research Department and
at those of the British Institute of Radio-
logy show how far it is from modem
European practice. In the April issue
of the “British Journal of Radiology,”
which expounds the latest developments
in one branch of cancer research, the
only cardinal article not based on re-
search in actual treatment tears to tatters
the most vaunted piece of academic
research done under the aegis of the
Sydney Cancer Research Committee.
The committee, judging by its balance
sheets, which are available only up to
December, 1932, and which are unsup-
plemented by reports procurable by the
public, spent £105,000, of which £57,000
went in salaries, in less than six years.
According to the Vice-Chancellor, about
£34,000 was laid out in treatment plants
and their maintenance. As The Bulle-
tin said in its original criticism, the
money was well spent under the segis of
Dr. F. P. Sandes, who is now travelling
Europe and America studying treatment
methods. His side of the organisation
has been beyond criticism.
It seems a fair thing that the Vice-
Chancellor should make a detailed report
so that subscribers may know what they
are getting for their money. After that, all
the isolated organisations which are deal-
ing with the question in various capitals
might be welded into a Commonwealth
body, their funds pooled and applied to
practical questions of treatment and re-
search, so as to achieve economy and
prevent overlapping. Despite advanced
methods and increasing cures, cancer is
eating up its victims at a rate which
grows alarmingly.
Out of 722 people who died in Sydney
in May from diseases other than heart
affections, 145 were killed by cancer. In
1930, the figure for May was 100.

Pacific Shipping.
The Commonwealth Government, which
seems incapable of doing anything to-
wards preventing U.S.A. subsidised ships
from pushing the British mercantile
marine off the South Pacific, should take
a look at the facts of the Cunard merger
case.
The plaintiff was the International
Mercantile Marine, a company registered
in New Jersey (U.S.A.). It sought to
prevent the merger between the Cunard
line and Oceanic Steamships which was
arranged as a condition precedent to the
subsidising of the Cunarder on the stocks
on the Clyde.
The I.M.M. was not actually a share-
holder in Oceanic Steamships, but had
a “beneficial interest” in some of the
shares. Had an injunction been granted,
it would have prevented the construction
of a ship that quite obviously will be a
strong competitor of American-subsidised
shipping. The case was dismissed with
costs against the plaintiff.
Meanwhile two U.S. luxury ships are
still scooping up most of the trans-Pacific
passenger trade. The Prime Minister of
Maoriland said recently that mail pay-
ments on 15 voyages, computed on a
poundage basis for unsubsidised ships,
would be 680 dollars, whereas actual
payments to the subsidised pair were
234,000 dollars each. For outward
voyages subsidies were £203,207 a year on
par exchange. To build these steamers the
U.S.A. found 11,700,000 dollars at almost
nominal interest, and another 5,887,500
dollars had been found to build a third
ship for the San Francisco-Melbourne
run. When she was operating, the sub-
sidy would increase to £265,000 p.a., par
exchange. Subsidies on cargo lines
brought the annual assistance figure to
£435,000 p.a. The P.M. added that the
size of the subsidies would enable the
co. to acquire its ships free of all mort-
gage at. the end of 20 years. It origin-
ally paid only one-fourth of the cost,
and had interest at 6 p.c. upon it out
of subsidy during the whole period. In
other words, it has had its ships free
of all capital expense.
Yet Mr. Lyons and his Cabinet are
unwilling or unable to deal with this
sort of competition from a nation which
shows an enormous trading balance with
us every year, and which never buys any-
thing Australian if it can help it.
«
Let Posterity Pay!
Canon Langford Smith has put forward
three reasons why St. Andrew’s Cathe-
dral, Sydney, should be pulled down and
a new one erected by pledging the credit
of people of all denominations and of
none.
(1) A “former Government” entered into
an agreement with Synod “for an exchange
of sites with adequate compensation.”
(2) The money would be spent on wages
and material and other expenses connected
with the building. Why keep it out of
the pockets of the workmen?
(3) The payment made to the Church
would be in bonds.
It is well known why the “former Gov-
ernment” entered into the agreement
with Synod. The chief reason was that
it had no hope of hanging on to office
much longer, and wanted to leave the
Bavin Government an embarrassing
problem. The trick was regarded as
excellent party tactics in Inner Group
circles ; and that, of course, it was. It
alienated Anglican support from the
Bavin Government.
The argument contained in paras. (2)
and (3) of the quotation from Canon
Langford Smith’s letter is drearily
familiar, though it has been more coarsely
expressed. “Find something that will
enable Bill and Mick and lock and the
rest of the boys to get congenial employ-
ment at top wages, and pass the bill on to
posterity.” The tragedy is that it rarely
fails to get results in Parliament. T. R.
Bavin stood out against it, to his honor.
Mr. Stevens, by the present look of things,
is inclined to yield, and, of course, Mr.
Lang and his followers will vote solidly
for a scheme which promises to put
£500,000 into “the pockets of the work-
men.”
♦
English and Erse.
An instructive cablegram from Dublin:
Mr. T. Derrig, the Minister for Educa-
tion, said in the Dafl that the Irish
language was dying out in Irish-speaking
districts. The old people did not like
Irish and would not interest the youngsters
in it when the economic value of English
was so evident.
The Cosgrave Government did its best
for Erse, and De Valera has carried on
the futile work. In the Free State, Gov-
ernment notices and proclamations are
issued bilingually ; roads and streets have
Erse as well as English names ; Erse is
a compulsory subject for entrants to the
civil service; the Galway University
gets a subsidy to encourage the study of
Irish ; there have been special recruiting
drives in the Gaeltacht —all unsuccessful
—to bring the army’s Irish-speaking bat-
talion up to strength. These and other
devices inspired by cranks have failed
because it is impossible, in the long run,
for politicians to persuade a country to
go against its economic interests.
A similar situation is to be witnessed
in Alsace. Alsatian is a Low German
dialect, and the French have already
given up their costly attempt to make
the inhabitants speak French. Pupils
may be taught German after two years
at school, religious instruction is carried
out in German, and so on.
Taxpayers would be saved vast sums
all over the world if interfering politi-
cians didn’t habitually make idiotic ex-
periments at their expense.
♦
The Public as Employer.
Judge Winneke, of the Vic. Railway
Classification Board, started an argument
when he suggested that the taxpayers
could furnish the wherewithal for pay-
increases: “I myself could afford a few
more pounds.”
An employer who is losing money is
not allowed to pay wages below award
rates, yet it is suggested that because the
railways are losing money salaries and
wages should be reduced. It is a bit
inconsistent.
Still, if the employer goes bung, his work-
people cease to draw wages. The Vic.
railways have been insolvent for years,
but wages and salaries continue to be
paid, partly out of the taxes. Very pro-
bably most of the taxpayers would like
to give the railwaymen more if they
could stand it, but, unlike Mr. Winneke,
they do not belong to a sheltered and
highly remunerative trade.


SOCIETY
"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Binduli”: A man arrested for
a trivial offence was fined £2 the
other day for offering the police-
man five bob to let him go. The
crudeness of the method is surely
as glaring as the paltriness of the
sum. That isn’t the way the ex-
perienced practitioner goes about
it. Years ago, when the Great Gold
Leak Commission was sitting in
Kalgoorlie, a detective and a
gentleman whose dealings in the
yellow metal had led to consider-
able suspicion attaching to him
were taking a day off at the local
races. There was some slight
acquaintance between them, and
the gold-dealer asked the ’tec if
he knew anything good. The latter
shook his head. “Give me your
racebook and I’ll mark it,” volun-
teered the citizen, who had already
been served with notice to appear
before the Commission ; “I’ve got
two or three tips worth backing.”
The sleuth handed over his pro-
gramme, and it came back, not
only with the markings, but with
a £lO note coyly nestling among
the leaves. Such at least was the
story the Commissioner listened to
a few days later.
“Bridge-o’-sighs”: An erstwhile race-
horse recently went west at Pymble
(N.S.W.), a steed whose memory, among
anti-Langites at least, is likely to outlive
that of Carbine or Phar Lap. It was the
animal ridden by De Groot when he un-
officially opened the Sydney Harbor
Bridge. A neddy used to the barrier and
not afraid of crowds was essential to the
success of the ludicrous exploit, and the
Pymble nag did all that was wanted of
him and a bit to spare. A broken leg
through tripping into a boghole accident-
ally finished him off.
❖ * * *
“C.Q.”: When the sacristan of St.
Patrick’s Cathedral in Melbourne opened
the doors the other morning the worst
act of vandalism and brigandage in local
history met his astonished gaze. The
ornamentation of solid gold, amethysts,
rubies and emeralds with which the
doors of the altars of the Blessed
Sacrament and the Sacred Heart were
encrusted —the doors were brought
from England at the end of last century
—was missing. It had been wrenched
off with a crucifix. Another crucifix, bent
double, was evidence of an attempt to
prise open a steel door leading to the
tabernacle housed under one of the
altars. Three gold crucifixes were miss-
ing, and the value of the gems, etc.,
looted is estimated at £lOOO. The thieves
entered the cathedral by shinning up a
waterpipe and dropping to the floor by
means of a rope, and oil droppings
everywhere indicated that they had used
the sanctuary lamps to light their pil-
laging.

“Smithy”: A one-teacher school in
our N.Q. district is taught by an Irish-
man with one of the brogues that Kipling
had in mind when he wrote “You could
cut out the soft South Irish accent with
a knife.” Most of the pupils are Italian
kiddies who couldn’t speak a word of
English until they were placed in his
charge. Now the influence of their
teacher’s tongue upon them is so marked
that it was commented on in the in-
spector’s report when he paid his recent
annual visit. Discussing it with a neigh-
bor, he assured me that he had heard
New Guinea natives speaking with a
broad Scotch accent gleaned from their
Presbyterian missionary.

“General Prac.” : Something of a rarity
these days is the baby who now lies in a
.Sydney hospital recovering from scurvy
on a diet of orange juice and mashed
potato. With oranges, lemons and pota-
toes at present prices, one would hardly
expect to find scorbutic disease in Syd-
ney, yet doctors with a taste for dietetics
“ You’re going to marry a dark woman and have six children.”
"Gosh, you’re not proposing to me, are you?”
tell me that it is by no means uncom-
mon. It is a delusion that scurvy is (or
was) a disease of sailors only, although
it was undoubtedly the curse of blue
water from the days of the Argonauts
until well into the nineteenth century.
Tough old Hawkins, the Elizabethan,
saw 10,000 men die of it during his 20
years at sea ; it almost wiped out Anson’s
expedition; and the Channel Fleet in
1779 reported over 2000 cases in two
months —men with swollen legs and
bleeding gums, unable to go aloft or even
to haul on a sheet. The naval surgeons
fought the disease with oranges, lemons
and limejuice for two centuries before
scurvy took the knock. One good soldier
in the scrap was Dr. John Hall, Shak-
speare’s son-in-law, who made an effec-
tive brew from scurvy-grass and water-
cress. Captain Cook used a decoction
of barley to keep down scurvy.
* * * *
“Stumer”: Counterfeit coins are rare
in England, where about £50,000,000
worth of silver is always in circulation.
So rare, in fact, according to the
Royal Mint, that the annual value of
bogus coins detected over a series of
years is less than £2OO. In effect,
the odds against a person getting a
crook half-crown or a forged tanner in
his change are about a quarter of a
million to one. In Australia two or three
years ago, one suspects they were a good
deal less than 100 to 1. Since then the
police have done a good deal to check
the evil, and the average citizen—also,
perhaps, the tram-conductor —is ceasing
to eye silver coins as carefully as he did.
* * * *
“Chev.”: The latest most daring car-
theft is reported from Melbourne. A
woman took her car out of the garage,
and, leaving the engine running, stepped
out to lock the garage doors. When she
turned round the conveyance, containing
her handbag and various belongings, was
careering gaily round the nearest corner.
* * * *
“Idle Imp”: According to postal-chief
H. P. Brown, the shilling Melbourne cen-
tenary stamp, which the public will be
able to see for the first time on July 1,
will be black. Mr. Brown chose
the color himself because he thought it
would be “unique and look nice.” It
certainly isn’t unique, and if it looks
nice it will be the first black stamp that
has. When Westralia made its first issue
of stamps in August, 1854, it selected
black as the color, but the experiment
wasn’t repeated until 1918, when the
Commonwealth put out a l td. King
George black —and had to convert it into
a deep brown. Not only is a black stamp
difficult to design and print, but it fails to
show up the post mark. Overseas a few
black stamps have been issued, but even
Italy and the French colonies and
protectorates, which take first place
when it comes to designing a picturesque,
finely-finished stamp, have failed to pro-
duce a decent black. If the minions of
Parkhill, tied down to a tradition of in-
artistic formality and complete banality,
expect to do so, they must be optimistic.

“X.N.0.”: “Sailor’s” par (B. 6/6/’34)
reminds me of a Portsmouth pawnbroker
who could always be relied upon to lend a
couple of pounds on a sextant or twenty
shillings on a sword. His shelves were
crammed with these and other articles
of naval equipment lodged by “snotties”
and acting-subs, among whom “depres-
sion” was a permanent institution. I
have known a youthful n.o. to acquire
a new sword at Gieve’s, take it round
the corner to Goldman’s and spend a
pleasant evening at the Empire and the
“Tick” on the proceeds. The best of
Goldman was that he would re-lend your
property if an admiral’s inspection or
other “panic” was imminent.

“Spare G. 5.0.”: “X.N.0.” (B. 13/6/’34)
needn’t kid himself that the Royal
Navy was the only service to adopt the
24-hour clocking which used to be
known as the “Continental system.” I
served under some column commanders
in the Boer War who made the use of
the all-round-the-clock system compul-
sory in their commands. Long before
the Great War started it was official in
the British Army. Its simplicity and
“foolproofness” need no stressing, and
the day is not far off when its use will
be universal. When that desirable con-
summation is followed by the adoption
of the equally foolproof decimal system,
the world will be able to get on with
other reforms.
* * * t-
“X.S.”: Francis O'Brien, the Rich-
mond wharf-laborer who killed his wife
and three children and then himself, vyas
one of those problems for which present-
day penology has no solution. O’Brien
was at one time headmaster of the Mil-
dura Central School. In 1924 he was
tried for the murder of his wife. He was
found not guilty on the ground of insanity
and consigned to Mont Park. In 1927
he was deemed to have recovered his
reason, and was released, though he was
required to report to the lunacy officials
for three years afterwards. Nothing
more was heard of him until his latest
outbreak. It turns out that he married
for the second time a year after his
release from the mental home. Dire
poverty, according to a note he left behind,
was the cause of his second attack of
homicidal impulse, but it could not have
been the cause of the first —he was one
of the most brilliant teachers in the Edu-
cation Department.

“Oxmead”: Lord Cottesloe, third
baron of his line, is presenting to the West-
ralian Parliament a portrait of his
great-uncle, Admiral Fremantle,
who hoisted the British flag on the
sandhills at the mouth of the Swan
River in June, 1829. The gift will
have its interest for local archaeolo-
gists, though the connection of the
Cottesloes and Fremantles with
Westralia apparently ended when
they had written these names in-
delibly on the map there. The
holder of the Cottesloe title has the
curious distinction of being a baron
in two places, the Austrian Empire
having ennobled a Fremantie, pre-
sumably for services rendered, in
the year after Waterloo ; the U.K.
barony dates no further back than
1874. The name “Fremantle” is
frequently misspelled in the early
records, as was perhaps natural
enough ; even on the sundial in the
Sydney Botanic Gardens it appears
as “Freemantle.” And maybe, like
Cottesloe (pronounced Cotslo), it is
seldom spoken correctly, either ; an
expert in these intricate matters
assured me years ago that family
usage requires that the pedal should
come down hard on the second
syllable.

“A.G.”: During the war I tra-
velled with a trainload of fellow-
Diggers from Taranto to Turin.
There were no Italians on the train
except the engine-driver and his
offsider. Last week I rode from
Rockhampton to Townsville (Q.)
on the Townsville Express. The
train was full of Italians. The only
Australians on board, except the
engine-driver and his offsider, were
a few train-jumpers, and these had
the misfortune to be hoicked off by
the police at Proserpine. After
their departure the conditions I had
experienced in Italy were reversed.
The Italians were migrating from
the Dawson Valley, where the
cotton-picking is finished, to the
northern districts, where the cane-cutting
is beginning.

Maoril and still has recollections of

Few of them retained their wealth. One,

thousand passed on next day at double
the amount, became demented; others
lived at a pace that beggared them in a
few years. The mines petered out, and,
though M.L. has seen one big revival,
the “mountains of gold” reputed to be

“Wayback”: Undoubtedly America
pioneered the “help yourself” method in
liquor bars (B. 6/6/’34), and 30 or 40
years ago I often noticed American
visitors to England keenly resentful at
having their liquor measured out by a
barman or barmaid. Countries border-
ing on the European side of the Mediter-
ranean have a much better arrangement
than either the English or the American
one. Graduated decanters or bottles are
placed before customers, and they pay
for the amount registered, large or small
The “finger” measurements started in the
U.S.A. Four fingers represented the full
height of the glass ; three stood for a
stiff nip ; two implied an ordinary nip.
and one was a suggestion that the danger
mark had been reached.

Of pep, L see her stand,
A devastating racquet
Gripped in her shapely hand;
With little of her hidden
From view, she goes unchidden
Where shorts are unforbidden
Nor naked shins are banned.
She’s supple, lithe and pretty,
She’s free and fair and fresh,
With never skirt or petti.
Her trilbies to enmesh.
Nor do they find it shocking,
Those stands with rapture rocking,
The scarcity of stocking,
The plenitude of flesh.
She knows ’twill cause no pother,
Whatever duds she’s shed ;
She has no cause to bother
What Grundy would have said —
That long-accepted symbol
For wowser eyes that gimble

Around the courts on nether
Limbs is our Dian borne,
Nearing the “altogether”
In point of what is worn,
And prudes, with prunes and prisms
And other archaisms,
Are dumped down deep abysms
Or scorched with scathing scorn.
Swift as a swooping swallow
She darts athwart your view;
She knocks convention hollow—
At least, she soon will do.
She’s poetry, pink-and-whitey....
Ah, brother mine, it’s mighty
Little we know of Blighty

T. THE R.


“M. de Paris”: My sympathy goes out
to an esteemed contemporary, Alfred
Kahl, for years Poland’s master execu-
tioner, who is suing the Government
for damages incurred in the pursuit of
his calling. He was about to turn off
a desperate criminal who had been
heavily chained before being conducted
to the drop when the ruffian fell on him
and beat him so cruelly with the fetters
that the artist was barely able to perform
his part of the contract. 1 can recall
a similar case in England many years
ago. According to custom, the maestro
had gone to the scaffold well primed for
his duty ; in fact, so generously primed
that when the drop was released he fell
through it along with his client and sus-
tained concussion. Not only did he fail
in his suit, but he was dismissed for
being intoxicated while on duty.

“Ike Hollar”: A parson remarked the
other day that when he was young chil-
dren were not allowed to become ac-
quainted with details of murders and
other sordid crimes; but my ex-
perience was different. When, as a
small boy, I was taken to England and
placed in a preparatory school in an
extremely select district, the favorite
game in the playground was “Jack the
Ripper.” I remember we tossed for the
privilege of enacting the elusive murderer.

“Roche”: “Retired Thug” tells of a
Hindoo thief who was attached to a ring
in a gaol wall when a crime it was~sought
to fix on him was committed, and hence
JACKO: “Blowed if I know what men
can see in these chorus-girls!”
had “a perfect alibi” (b. 13/6/’34). But
even being in gaol (officially) isn’t always
a successful defence to a charge of bur-
glary. At Bunbury (W.A.) the other day
three men pleaded guilty to charges of
having stolen from a warehouse £BO
worth of assorted gods at an hour in the
night watches when they were all, accord-
ing to the records, in Bunbury gaol. All
three were serving sentences there, but
one of them, whose term was nearly up,
had been permitted a certain amount of
freedom to enable him to serve as an
orderly. How they escaped from and
returned to durance wasn’t explained, but
the so-called orderly, who was released
a few days after the burglary, was
arrested with some of the stolen goods in
his possession, and “came across,” as the
detectives say, his confession so implicat-
ing the other two (still in gaol) that they
too threw up the sponge. The R.M. was
lenient and contented himself with giving
them six months apiece, nor was any
additional charge of gaol-breaking pre-
ferred. What happened to the regular
gaolers has yet to be disclosed.

in Trench Fighting” (1916):
High explosive shells are filled with
lyddite, T.N.T., or amatol, the heavier
and field-gun shells with one of the two
latter.... With detonation the smoke of
all three is black, but in the case of
T.N.T. or amatol it is tinged with grey
and less dense than that of lyddite. When
lyddite explodes, the smoke is thick and
yellow, but with the other two substances
the smoke is thin and greyish.
It follows obviously that the “charac-
teristic white bursts” mentioned in the
extract from the “British Official History”
were caused by time shrapnel.

“Cooroo” (writing from beyond Foo-
chow, China): “Feng-Shui’s” article on
a tour of Chinese sweat-shops in Singa-
pore (B. 4/4/’34) naturally interested me,
because I was his companion. Except
that I am not a 6ft. 4in. Maorilander,
don’t look like a policeman, and
didn’t tramp upstairs (there being none),
his story is substantially correct. It was
Christmas Eve. We were filled with in-
dignation (partly alcoholic) to see youths
toiling at sewing-machines on such an
occasion, and ordered them to cease
forthwith. We ignored the fact that
Christmas means nothing to Chinese.
It was like our dashed cheek. The pro-
prietors were breaking no law; the
workers were almost certainly under-
paid and overworked according to
our Australian ideas, but not accord-
ing to their Chinese ones. We were,
in fact, doing the very thing that
“Ferig-Shui” is railing at —interfering
in someone else’s garden. Half the
trouble in China to-day has been caused
by people like us thrusting ideas on a
people who were neither ready for them
nor capable of appreciating them. I
know now, what I hadn’t grasped then,
that in the end every race must work
out its own salvation.

“Ova”: The fictions of the law are
sometimes amusing. The other day a
man was charged in a Sydney suburban
court with adulterating eggs. Of course,
he hadn’t done so in the Websterian
sense—“to corrupt or make impure by
an admixture of baser materials.” His
offence was that he sold wrong-’uns that
had been discarded by the Egg Board,
The Egg Board entrusted these rejects to
a minion with instructions to convey
them to a rubbish-tip. Instead, he turned
1800 of them over to defendant (who
said he could use them as pig-feed) in
return for gifts of bacon. But defendant
sold the debased hen-fruit to pastrycooks,
and the Board of Health got on his trail.
He was fined eight pounds. The pastry-
cooks ought to be fined eighty.
* * * $
“Haragu”: That reference to Jukes —
not “Tukes” —the chaplain-naturalist of
H.M.S. Fly (B. 13/6/’34), recalls that the
gentleman sowed a seed in what is now
Papua which was to bear unpleasant
fruit in later years. The Fly was in
“And you swore you’d always treat me like a queen!”
“Well, ’ang it, I ain’t ’Enry the Eighth.”
Torres Strait waters in the late 1840’s, and
Jukes tells in his diary—one of the best
records of early N.G. exploration—how
he and a boat party ascended one of the
big rivers of the Delta division of Papua
and came on an abandoned native vil-
lage, where they annexed a pig. In the
mid-’eighties MacGregor came to the same
village and was received so ominously
that he made up his mind to retreat
down river. He had to fight his way
through a canoe armada manned by
bowmen. Years after he learned that the
attack was a “payback” for the pig
Jukes admitted pinching. The Papuan
has a long memory.

“Caveman”: The distinction of hold-
ing the most variegated job in the Com-
monwealth must surely belong to a rail-
way guard in the N.T., whose activities
are summarised as follows:
Marshal the train at Darwin, check all
waybills, issue and collect tickets along
the line, deliver and receive official mails,
unload trucks, do all shunting, see to de-
livery of provisions and perishable food-
stuffs, attend to telephones, sign all loco,
sheets for driver and fireman, and do all
railway work except at Katherine and Pine
Creek; pay all railway workers, take
charge of money from stations, collect
payment for goods delivered, load or un-
load goods at unattended sidings (there
are 12 of these), carry pay for police
and pensioners where there are no post
offices, and generally take charge of the
passengers, cargo and trucks from time of
leaving Darwin on Wednesday morning
until the return on Saturday.
He strikes one as the sort of man who
would be useful in arranging the details
for the royal visit.

“F.S.”: A surprising thing happened
at a meeting of the Centenary Com-
mittee in Melbourne the other day
when the right of the artist to be con-
sidered an expert at his own job was
given a majority vote. Debate was
initiated over the design for the proposed
medal by sculptor Rayner Hoff. There
was the usual display of Philistinish
facetiousness, Portland’s representative,
Williamson, M.L.C., remarking that the
ram’s skull suggested a drought, and that
the wire representing the Yallourn elec-
trical industry suggested a clothesline.
Lud Mayor Smith then called on Russell
Grimwade, who got up and bowled the
dissidents over. He said that, even if
Melbourne couldn’t appreciate symbol-
ism, it was to be hoped its visitors would.
Moreover, a committee of 40 artists and
architects had appointed a subcommittee
of four, and these experts had approved
of the design. He pointed out that a
picture of a jackass perched on a
boomerang, with “Advance, Australia,”
underneath, might earn popular approval,
but the artists were entitled to exercise
their judgment in their own domain re-
gardless of what people said who didn’t
know what they were talking about.
There was dead silence after this address,
and the design was accepted.
“Kumusi”: I suppose everyone has his
moments of horror which haunt him ever
after (B. 6/6/’34). My pet experience
happened in a B.N.G. whaleboat years
ago when dynamiting fish. I had the
wife and the usual native crew with me,
and was up in the bows of the boat with
a cartridge to drop over. I lit the fuse,
and the infernal thing dropped, not out-
side the boat, but inside it. It became
wedged between a stringer and the out-
side planking. Fortunately, the fuse was
long, and after a desperate struggle I
managed to prise the thing out and drop
it overboard, when it exploded after sink-
ing a few feet. Wiping the sweat off my
face, I noticed the boat was up by the
nose. The brown mariners were all down
in the sternsheets, and had only been re-
strained from diving overboard by the
missus, determinedly swinging a 4ft. oak
tiller.

“C.Q.”: The discovery in Italy of a
marble bust, alleged to be the only life-
time portrait of Julius Cassar in existence,
recalls Mark Twain’s story in “The Inno-
cents Abroad.” There was in existence
in Rome in his time an authentic skull of
the great dictator. A guide took Mark
and his friends by devious ways to see
this imposing relic. After gazing at it
solemnly for some time, Mark turned to
the guide with “Now show us a skull
of Caesar when a boy.”

■“General Prac.”: Most papers seem
to be agreed that the next war will be
an affair of poison gas, largely directed
at non-combatants, and at least four
different forms of death from the skies
are being predicted. In Germany, those
interested have memorised a little rhyme
which epitomises the effects of the vari-
ous gases—“white cross” does this,
“green cross” does that, and so on. One
statement I have read is that 40 tons of
vesicant (or blistering) gas, rained down
over London, might remain canalised
in the Thames Valley for five days or so,
after which there would be no Londoners
left. Rubber-gloved and masked techni-
cians, it seems, will treat the blistered and
gasping thousands with nailbrushes, bi-
carbonate of soda, hydrogen peroxide or
permanganate of potash, according to re-
quirements. I suppose the whole busi-
ness commenced originally in some
laboratory run by a mild professor in
carpet slippers, who grew carnations as
a sideline. A decent little man, no doubt ;
but, as one of my journals says, all this
“must inevitably heighten the general
sense of insecurity.”
GOOD TALK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They’re never heard at debating clubs,
And nobody yet has stirred
To give them measure of just acclaim
And write them up on the scroll of fame
With “Orators 1 Have Heard,”
Yet to me they often make Deakin tame
And “Radio Jim” absurd.
For never was such a cheerful hum
Since the days when speech began,
And never fluency so replete
With gentle humor and wisdom sweet
To tickle the ears of man,
As when the eggs and the bacon meet
To chat in the frying-pan.
There’s verve and snap in their repartee,
There’s balm in their banter mild.
By Pepys’ gossip or Johnson’s sense,
By graphic Kipling or Conrad tense
You often may be beguiled;
Find Pater splendid, Carlyle immense,
Delight in the wit of Wilde;
But when there’s ice on the drinking-troughs,
And the frost creeps up your legs,
When the jest seems flat and the quips too tart,
And the loftiest flight of poetic art
No better than Silas Wegg’s,
A subtler eloquence steals your heart
And you thrill to a speech, supreme, apart,
As the bacon talks to the eggs.

POLITICAL POINTS
War-debt payments amounting to All
million dollars fell due at Washington
on June 15. In flat defiance of the
Hiram Johnson Act, only one of the 15
Governments concerned sent anything but
excuses or refusals —Finland paid
166,000 dollars. Germany improved the
shining hour by declaring “ a full mora-
torium” in respect of its borrowings.
This hurts Father Bull, but it will hurt
Uncle Sam more.
Creditors are briskly reminding their
debtors, and debtors their creditors, that
June 15 was Magna Charta Day!
The toll of the war never ends. Next
year expenditure on war pensions to the
75,000 partly or wholly incapacitated
Diggers, 8000 widows and 181,000 de-
pendants will go up from £6,860,000 to
£7,065,000, irrespective of any increases
that may be voted—and to these they
have the first right, if only because they
are the only section affected by the Pre-
mier s’-plan cuts that never squealed.
There are still 16,866 returned men re-
ceiving medical attention.
State and Commonwealth electoral
districts are identical in the Speck, and
as a party polls for the State so, as a
rule, will it poll for the Commonwealth.
Beaten two to one at the 1931 Assembly
election, Labor at the end of the year
was licked for every House of Reps,
seat; but on June 9 figures it will not
be in that position next time. It was
down 3000 in Lyons’s electorate (Wilmot)
and a thousand or so in Darwin, but it
was a few hundred votes to the good in
Bass (Guy’s electorate), 1200 or 1300 in
Franklin and a couple of thousand in
Denison. This doesn’t say much for
Lyons’s influence in his native State.
Tas. electors do not change their
opinions about parties much, but they do
about individual politicians. Three years
ago T. J. Butler (Nat.) was the first man
elected for Darwin, scoring the 'greatest
primary vote ever given to a candidate
for the Assembly—sB46. On June 9
Butler was a poor eleventh in a field of
seventeen. Also Hon. Minister Hobbs,
one of the four Nat. members, lost not
only his seat, but his deposit.
Earle Page, Paterson and Senator
Elliott are off to the Speck to talk to
the farmers there, and the U.A.P.’s
g.h.q. is so wild with them for “poach-
ng” that it threatens to break off negotia-
tions for an election agreement. “Poach-
ing” is a queer charge, since McWilliams,
the Cockies’ first Federal leader, was
M.H.R. for Franklin, and Atkinson
(Wilmot) also joined them, although he
returned to the Nats. Revival of the
C.P. organisation might avert the loss of
at least one Tas. seat to Labor.
Apparently as a reply to recent Bulle-
tin articles, the N.S.W. Road Transport
Commission has ordered 14 more double-
decker ’buses for Sydney suburbs. As a
grudging admission that the travelling
public has some rights, this is to be
welcomed, but on the financial side it
gives no cause for joy. For the year to
June 30, 1933, the department had 98
’buses on the roads (it had bought 171)
and announced a profit of £1514. The
Auditor-General aridly pointed out that
the service was exempt from taxes and
fees which, in the case of a private con-
cern, would have amounted to £4900 on
vehicles operating at September 30.
Vic. metropolitan electors are evidently
a great deal more interested in their
City Council than in their Upper House.
For 17 vacancies in the Upper House
there were only 24 candidates, and for
six contested electorates the poll averaged
30 p.c., falling in Melbourne East to
17 p.c. A vacancy for a City Council
ward brought out a field of six, and 80
p.c. voted. One of the defeated candi-
dates —Angliss—had just been returned
unopposed for the Leg. Council.
The Japanese Vice-Consul at Nanking
has added a classic chapter to the book
of international relations. On his way
in a rickshaw to farewell a colleague,
he vanished. His Government concluded
that he had been murdered, and sent
warships ; but a few days later he was
found plunged in slumber on Purple
Mountain, whither, he explained some-
what incoherently, he had wandered,
becoming tired of life. Had he slumbered
a few hours longer he might have been
awakened by guns.
Latham came back from Japan unob-
trusively after having done a good job
for Australia. U.A.P. newspapers embar-
rassed him by announcing straightway
that he might become Chief Justice of
the High Court; still, why shouldn’t he?
He is an eminent constitutional lawyer
whom even Labor Governments consult,
and he has sacrificed a good deal—many
“See they nearly had a draw in Tasmania.”
“What, were the Vies, playing the Tassies, as well as South Oss?”
briefs when he enlisted for war service ;
thousands of guineas a year when he
became A.-G., and the Prime Minister-
ship when he stood aside for Lyons.
The Labor factions will rage if he
mounts the Bench, but there will be no
howls from the Bar such as greeted
other appointments.
Senator Jack Barnes, Parker Moloney
and Crofts will constitute the Vic. Labor
ticket for the Senate. Barnes led that
Chamber for Scullin ; Moloney, who was
Scullin’s Minister for Markets, lost his
seat at the election precipitated by the
Langsters ; Crofts leads the Lang group
at Melbourne Trades Hall. It is hoped
that mutual friends will contrive to keep
him and Moloney apart.
In helping to shove the Secession Bill
through the Leg. Council, Labor Minister
Drew repeated the now-familiar story
that “the financial agreement was forced
on the States under duress.” It was sub-
mitted to the people, and the people of
all the States accepted it. The voting in
Westralia was 96,193 for and 71,552
against.
Granny “Herald,” who was banging
Lyons a few weeks ago, is now moved to
tears at the thought of his sacrifices.
The very great service that he personally
rendered to this country involved the
breaking of associations of a lifetime
which, even to a man of less human quali-
ties, would have brought mental anguish.
Still, it also brought him a seat
in Parliament which he would other-
wise have lost, and a job—the best he
ever had —which he would not otherwise
have landed. So Joseph’s anguish should
be assuaged.
The latest One Big Loan enthusiast is
Tunnecliffe, who says that every work-
less Victorian could be employed by the
State raising £50,000,000 at 3 p.c., spend-
ing it in seven years on “whatever works
appear to be necessary,” and paying the
relief-tax revenue into a sinking fund,
equivalent to } p.c. At the end of the
seven years Victoria would have an-
other mammoth debt, a very small sink-
ing fund and a miscellaneous lot of
works “that appeared to be necessary,”
built by mostly inexperienced labor.
Tunnecliffe allows nothing for losses,
though for 11 months of the present year
expenditure on the Vic. railways, on
which real navvies did the construction
work, exceeded revenue by £1,064,000.
They also “appeared to be necessary.”
Somerville, the old Westralian Labor-
ite, who has been granted leave from the
State Arbitration Bench so that he may
help in preparing the case against seces-
sion, hit back vigorously when the seces-
sionists objected. He described their
movement as “a badly-bred brumby by
Trickery out of Party Politics.” Secesh
is now demanding his dismissal.
There will be keen competition at the
Loan Council for the £8,500,000 to be
distributed among the States from the
proceeds of the Commonwealth loan.
The Commonwealth Bank will be asked
to finance another litter of deficits, and
is expected to suggest that they should
be reduced. In view of the wool situa-
tion Loan Councillors should be meet-
ing in a cautious mood, but Australian
politicians are never like that when there
is loan money about.
Butler has offended a section of his
followers by suggesting that South Aus-
tralia would be better out of the butter-
marketing arrangement, and another sec-
tion by borrowing from the State Sav-
ings Bank instead of sharing in the pro-
ceeds of the Commonwealth loan, which,
he complains, was too dear. He is not
alone in that opinion (the N. S. Wales
Graziers concur); still, they are saying
in Adelaide that his Government will
never live to take advantage of its Five-
Year Parliaments Act.
The attitude of the average Transport
Regulation Board suggests that it would
like to drive private motor-’buses and
-waggons off the public roads with
machine-guns. Victoria has acquired
one that is different. It announced last
week that, “as a general principle,” it
was not going to impose restrictions on
goods vehicles carrying passengers for
six months ; for the rest, it was
strongly of the opinion that the positions
of the railways and the ordinary road
operator should not be treated differently.
Both provide public transport services, and
we are concerned that those services should
be economic, adequate and efficient.
It is a bitter disappointment to those
who expected that the board would bring
a nineteenth-century mind to bear on
the problems of 1934.
It is not yet a crime to defy party
machines, but it may be some day.
Asked what he thought of the Vic. Cocky
members who had opened the door to
the “unendorsed” Martin, M.L.A., Stahle,
treasurer of the party organisation,
shouted that they had “placed them-
selves above the law.” Then the cham-
pion of the law placed himself among
the prophets: “I shall be surprised if
the Central Council does not unani-
mously stand to its decision: Mr. Mar-
tin is no longer a member of the party.’
He is the choice of the people of Gun-
bower ; but that does not seem to
matter.
According to Mussolini, world re-
covery depends chiefly on the solution
of the problems of the Saar, the Danube,
the Far East and disarmament. It
oughtn’t to take much to settle those
small difficulties —seven or eight major
wars and a few centuries of persistent
negotiation will about do it.
From a bitter cynic:
These “Westralians” who wave the banner
of the Black Swan are a queer lot. Collier,
who introduced the Secession Bill, is a Vic-
torian. Keenan, who supported it for the
Nats., is Irish. Latham, who championed it for
the Cockies, is English. Prowse, M.H.R., an-
other enthusiast, comes from N. S. Wales;
Gregory, M.H.R., from Victoria; the chairman
of the Secesh League is another Victorian;
and McCallum Smith, whose “Sunday Times"
started the thing, is a Scot. As director of the
W.A. Bank McSmith helped to dispose of it to
the ’Wales. Lovekin, of the “Daily News,”
sold his secesh organ to another group of
financiers from the exorbitant East, and in-
vested the proceeds in Britain. Lovekin is
now with God, but the other “Westralians,”
though somewhat stricken in years,, are still
ready to perish in the last pill-box facing the
insulting foe on the other side of the Nullarbor
Plain.

M.L. will be sorry to lose Lord
Bledisloe, whose term finishes this year.
Farmers consider him the most know-
ledgeable Governer the Dominion has
had. His range is surprising, and includes
such diverse subjects as the breeding of
pigs, the cultivation of flowers and the
growing of fruit. The other day, in
appreciation of his interest in their in-
dustry, M.L. fruitgrowers named a new
apple after him —a cross between the
Delicious and the Gorgeous Crab.
G. S. Carruthers, formerly a Laborite,
is the first Douglas Credit candidate to
be returned, as such, to any Australian
Parliament. Tasmania owns him, and
Denison, which covers Hobart, is his
seat. He is an Englishman, and was
educated at Lancaster School and Selwyn
College, Cambridge. He started as a
parson, had a nervous breakdown, jour-
neyed to the Speck and took up fruit-
growing in the Derwent Valley. His
likeableness as a man makes up for his
unimpressive platform delivery.
E. H. Cornish, Commissioner of Taxes
for S.A., has reached the retiring age.
The Butler Government decided that he
was indispensable for the Royal Com-
mission conferences, so the axe has been
buried till the end of 1935.
Sixty years ago Ned Allen, of Kenil-
worth (Q.), was Australia’s champion
buckjump rider, and to-day, at 91, he
can still sit many a prad that would dis-
place youngsters. Born in England, he
landed in Australia in 1851, and followed
gold-mining in every State before he
settled down to the calling of horse-
breaker in N. S. Wales. He went to
Queensland at the beginning of the cen-
tury, and has been there ever since.
Old John Evans is expected to
wear the robes again in the Speck’s
Assembly. If so, he will have stuck
to the job longer than anyone since the
introduction of responsible government.
Robert Officer had 15 years of it, and
his period was consecutive. Labor Gov-
ernments have cut in on Evans’s record.
English literature at Sydney Uni. has
been inculcated hitherto by Bohemians.
Professor John Waldock, who has suc-
ceeded the late J. le Gay Brereton,
is different. The son of a Baptist clergy-
man, he dresses conventionally, and has
lived for some time at the Y.M.C.A. A
Sydney Uni. man with an Oxford finish,
he was the selection from a large field.
A. D. Hill, secretary to Adelaide
Steamship Co. at its head office, goes to
Scotland this month for the trial runs on
the Clyde of the co.’s new s.s Manoora.
He will return in her first voyage. Hill
lived in every mainland State during his
37 years’ service.
Tale of a coat:
The late Lt.-Col. J. E. Fraser, D. 5.0., was
known to Diggers of his acquaintance as “the
Cove, with the Coat.” On joining up with the
Scottish Rifles towards the end of last century
he was issued with One Great Coat. When
he went to the S. African War it appeared
on his transfer sheet. Returning to Australia,
he was transferred to the Signallers, together
with the coat. On the reorganisation of the
forces, he was transferred to another signal
unit, and once again a sheet was made out for
the coat. When the World War started the
coat was sent along on a transfer sheet to the
A.I.F. On his return to Australia in 1919,
Fraser became O.C. the 2nd Div. Signals.
This led to another transfer of the coat. Then
he retired, went on the reserve of officers,
and returned the coat to base. This meant
that he was without a Great Coat. One of
the military geniuses at Canberra found out,
and he got a bill for 30s—to One Great
Coat. Not bad as an example of departmental
fatuity, especially as, 36 years before, the coat
had been valued at 225. 6d.
“D.”: John Terry, head of one of the
oldest squatter families in Australia, who
has died after a motor smash, came of
a line that has always taken chances.
Denistone, the original Terry home, near
Ryde (now a Sydney suburb), had one
of the stiffest steeplechase courses in the
world, and all the Terrys used to lark
over it. John Terry was a particularly
fine and daring horseman. His eldest
boy Dick met his death in a fire four
years ago.
K. M. Campbell, who has just re-
turned to Adelaide from China, has had
more adventures than most men. He
was with the Eastern Extension Co. at
Cocos when Von Mueller arrived in
T 5. Campbell had one of the shortest
terms on record as a prisoner of
war. In the same locality he had to
dive for it when his boat got too near the
propellers of a P. and O. liner. He was
after a cask dropped by the big ship at
the time. A few years ago he was
ordered to leave his bacon and eggs and
grab a lifebelt; that was when the Mala-
bar tried to reach Long Bay (Sydney)
gaol. At Sharppeak, his last station,
which has Chinese pirates as near neigh-
bors, he, his wife and children were under
rifle fire for some time from a rebel
army.
Australia’s next-of-kin expert, Thomas
William Lloyd, who died in Melbourne
the other day, aged 85, spent most of
his long life identifying people who
didn’t know they were rich till he told
them so. He got money for thousands,
and was pestered by other thousands
who were not entitled to fortunes but
firmly believed they were.
Herewith a suggestion from Finey
which may be of use to some member
of the Stained
Glass Window
Designers’ Union
in years to come.
The artist has as-
sumed that the
Anglican Ar c fa-
bishop of Sydney
will eventually be-
come eligible for
canonisation. In
the short time that
the Archbishop has
been in Australia,
he has impressed
himself on mem-
bers of every de-
nomination as the
possessor of all the
Christian virtues,
notably charity.
There is nothing
small or niggling
about him, and this
applies no less to
his character than
to his physique.
He is 6ft. 4in. and
built in proportion.
Joe Wallis, of the
Stadium, was
plunged in gloom
on first seeing the
Archbishop and
his irremovable
smile. “What a
h e a vy weight
champ, lost to
England and the
world! ” mused
the referee. Arch-
bishop Mowll is a
product of King’s
School, Canterbury
(where Somerset
Maugham, amongst
other famous mod-
erns, was educated),
and King’s College, Cambridge; and he
was Bishop in Western China when the
call came from Sydney.
Charles French, Chief Government
Biologist of Victoria, is retiring after 40
years’ front-line fighting against codlin-
moth, lucerne flea, cockchafer grub and
other storm troops of the insect army.
He will continue as acting-lecturer on
entomology at the University, and is put-
ting in odd moments on a handbook on
insect pests in general. In the ’eighties
he assisted Baron von Mueller. His
father was Chief Biologist before him.
Allan Vickers, the “Flying Doctor” of
the Aerial Medical Services established
by the Australian Inland Mission, hasn’t
wasted his time while convalescing after
his recent motor smash. As a result of
negotiations with the Aero. Club in Mel-
bourne, a new base is to be laid down
at Port Hedland, W.A. From his former
base at Cloncurry the doctor attended
about one patient per day. He will take
charge of the Westralian centre.
From “Cauboy”:
Owen Balmforth, a S’African visitor, has
a scheme for an exchange of repertory com-
panies between Australia and his Dominion.
He has inspected our dramatic goods and is
satisfied with them. The only S’African com-
pany that has visited • the Commonwealth so
far was semi-professional. It opened at the
old Playhouse in Melbourne some years ago.
A vice-regal party turned up and found to
its astonishment that it was practically the
only audience present. The great inter-imper-
ial event turned out to be an ancient farce-
comedy, and the acting was poor. S’Africa
has no regular commercial theatre where
amateurs can acquire professional polish, but
Mr. Balmforth says they are forging ahead
artistically all the same.
An early Australian V.C., Sergeant
Thomas Morris, has just retired from
the N.S.W. police ; he joined it after the
Boer War, in which he got his deco-
ration. Morris was one of the N.S.W.
Lancers who went to England for train-
ing in British cavalry methods 35 years
ago. He is still a crack rifle shot, and.
looks as fit as when he first went to the
Corowa police district.
ARCHBISHOP MOWLL, in stained glass.
Monsignor O’Connell, of Junee (N.S.W.),
has celebrated the 60th anniversary of
his ordination. Though 85, he still per-
forms all his priestly duties. His friends
claim that he is the State’s oldest motor-
driver. He and his car are known from
Goulburn to Broken Hill, and as far
south as the border.
Australia’s most persistent railway em-
ployees are the Landers. Harry Lander,
of Goulburn, was a mail-guard between
Sydney and Albury. His three sons were
all guards, and the family traditions are
being carried on by his grandsons. Dad
and sons (67, 64 and 61) have had 42,
45, 43 and 39 years’ service; the grand-
sons have 23, 15 and 11 years’ service
respectively. The founder of the line is
still fairly fit at 94.
P. B. Macgregor, of Q., who formally
announced a few days back that he had
taken silk, is a Balliol man. He was
associate first to Lilley and then to
Griffith, and he has acted as a D.C. and
Supreme Court Judge. Tennis is his
game. He was captain of several inter-
state tennis teams, and won the Q. cham-
pionship in 1892. His eldest daughter is
Mary Macgregor, the actress.
“J.H.”: The late Captain Batchelor,
who swallowed the anchor some years
ago to become a Vancouver pilot, was in
the Australian overseas windjammer trade
in the early part of the century. His
main command was the Cedarbank. He
never lost a spar or a hand overboard,
though he made passages of 77 days from
New York'to Melbourne, 80 from Phila-
delphia to Melbourne and 82 from Mel-
bourne to Queenstown, and once was
responsible for a day’s run Easting-
downing of 352 knots. The Cedarbank
was submarined during the World War.
Batchelor made his first trip to Australia
in ’7O on the barque Sidlaw, of 750 tons,
and piloted the motorship Aorangi, of
18,000 tons, into Vancouver just before
his death.
“D.H.”:\ How many members of the
B.M.A. have acted as medico and under-
taker? Dr. Kirkland, of the N.T.,
recently found a patient, from whom he
had received an urgent summons, dead ;
he wrote out a death certificate, helped to
dig the grave, read the burial service and
caught the rattler back to Darwin.
Attorney-General Latham, who is said
to have astonished Nanking University
with a discourse upon the relative influ-
ences of Greek and Chinese philosophies,
was a lecturer for 20 years at Melbourne
University, and he looks and talks like
one still. He has distinguished himself
on many delegations, but the job for
which he is best fitted is no doubt the
Federal C.J.-ship.
E. S. Berry, dead in Adelaide at nearly
90, was native-born and in S.A. Survey
Department all his life. As a young
man he was in Goyder’s exploring ex-
pedition, and a bit later was second in
command in that of Gosse.
“R.N.”: Sir Maurice Hankey, who, it
is said, will be asked to advise on de-
fence when he arrives for the centenary
celebrations, is an Australian, inasmuch
as his father lived in S. Aus. half a cen-
tury ago, and he was born there. How-
ever, he went to an English prep, school
and Rugby as a small boy, joined the
Marines 40 years ago, and hasn’t been
here since. He had little sea service,
the whole of his career from the begin-
ning of the century onwards having been
spent at the Admiralty. He is said to
have been secretary to more organisa-
tions than any man in England. Though
he retired with the rank of colonel, he
has done no war service ; in him Mel-
bourne will see the perfect type of cor-
rect London civil servant. He got his
G.C.M.G. for work as secretary of The
Hague Conference. If Mr. Lyons is seri-
ous about asking Sir Maurice to advise
on local defence, and if he complies
(which is unlikely), the London service
clubs will get the laugh of the season.
A comparable situation would be the
appointment of our Mr. Shepherd to
advise on the defence of British Guiana.

It was a poor year for the banks in
the Dominion. Though the value of
merchandising exports for the 12 months
to the end of March (£46,043,000, local
currency) was £8,533,000 better, thanks
largely to the rise in the price of wool,
imports (£20,908,000) were down
£1,141,000 in terms of sterling. In the
exchange market the banks thus bought
more and sold less. The charge for
advances was lowered from 6 p.c. to 5
p.c. from May 1, 1933, and a half of
one per cent, was knocked off the price
paid for deposits two months later. The
dulness locally is reflected by a contrac-
tion of £2,709,527 in the book value of the
B.N.Z.’s advances, of £122,791 in the bills
figures and of £79,598 in the note issue,
and a growth of £1,754,805 in deposits,
of which over two-thirds are interest-
bearing. The extra money that became
available was mostly invested in low-
interest-bearing liquids, up £4,258,899,
returns from which have shrunk with the
fall in interest rates.
After providing for contingencies, the
slip in the year’s gross earnings was
£176,432, making the contraction
£439,505, or 21.8 p.c., over the last three
years:—•

•After making provision for contingencies.
Though rates and taxes were £163,164
lighter, other exes, were £7969 heavier,
due apparently to the cost of handling
the larger export business and of manag-
ing the Banks’ Indemnity (Exchange)
Act. The shrinkage in net earnings was
£21,237. After attention to the pref.
and mortgage share requirements,
enough remained to show 9.9 p.c. on the
£3,750,000 of ord. capital as against 9.9,
8.1, 15, 17.8, 16.9 and 15.6 p.c. back to
1928. So If- p.c. was chipped off the div.,
reducing it to 10 p.c.
Owing to the fall in interest rates,
the increase in demand deposits and
the stay in the growth of fixed deposits,
the market prices the pound ords.
at 51s. 6d. as against 445. lOd. a year
ago. The return at 51s. 6d. is 3.8 p.c.
on a 10 p.c. div. basis, though there is
no certainty about the 10 p.c. being
maintained. Last year’s divs., together
with 4 p.c. on £529,989 of old guaranteed
stock, called for a wink over 5 p.c. on
total funds (debentures, capital and re-
serves combined) at March 31. That the
declared net return on these funds was
only £llB6 short of the amount distri-
buted suggests that the assets are well
worth their book value.
Here is the position so far as balance-
sheet figures show it:

When the books closed advances had
fallen to 65.1 p.c. of deposits against
76.9 p.c. a year earlier and 85.8 p.c. in
1930. Depositors and others could see
over £7l of every £lOO of their money
in liquids, and the bank was holding only
£3 14s. 4d. belonging to the public for
every pound of its own. It is an excep-
tionally strong position, but it means
moderate earning power.

•Subject to taxation.
The position of shareholders in this 11-
year-old pioneer of the bond-selling
method of financing forestry ventures
appears to be very snug, notwithstanding
the sharp fall in the sale of bonds, which
are the co.’s chief source of earnings to
date. The contraction in last year’s sales,
etc. —the etcetera include 6 p.c. of the
maintenance trust fund, plus returns
from other investments—was £161,595, of
which £157,444 was offset by savings in
selling, development and maintenance
charges, etc. The declared net result was
£4151 short of the previous year’s at
£24,308. The usual 8 p.c. div. was
repeated, and, after setting aside £9OOO
for the taxgatherer, free reserves
amounted to £21,068, up £6698 during the
year.
The real position depends upon how
much of the £1,083,556 (up £20,582)
specifically earmarked for planting, main-
tenance, etc., is ultimately required. The
bonds have been sold from £25 upwards,
and £3,802,443 worth (face value) was
on the books at the end of March, 1933.
Among other things, the co.’s contract
with bondholders provides for transfer
of the freehold (average cost to all affores-
tation cos. in Maoriland is about £2 10s.
an acre), planting and maintenance, etc.,
until the forests are realised at the dis-
cretion of bondholders, or for 20 years,
whichever is the earlier. One co. reckons
it can do all this, including the cost of
selling the bonds, for £l2 or thereabouts
an acre. It seems quite probable, there-
fore, that a substantial portion of this
co.’s planting and maintenance reserve
(the lot was equal to £5 9s. Bd. per pound
of paid capital) may. turn out to be
genuine profit, though costs vary greatly
in different concerns.
The position so far as balance-sheet
figures show it is as follows:
1930. 1933. 1934.
Paid capital .. .. £191,266 £197,536 £197,536
Sundry creditors .. 91,361 46,538 27,279

Maintenance reserves .. 455,952 566,194 567,905
Cash 11,695 41,770 17,793
The year’s chief movements were a reduc-
tion of £19,259 in the amount coming to
sundry creditors, a growth of £180,365 in
the book value of investments, and of
£16,167 in the sundry debtors’ item.
Bondholders’ balances were reduced by
£163,081, and the cash holding by
£23,977. The growth in the more or less
liquid surplus (£1,287,203) was £30,444.
The maintenance reserve is held in trust
by the representative of the bondholders
as a guarantee that the co. will carry out
its contracts ; this it has faithfully done
to date, and is in a position to continue
to do so.
The co. has also made arrangements
to become selling agent for bondholders
in connection with the realisation of the
forests— l} p.c. of gross sales for cash,
and 2j p.c. on any other basis. It has
also agreed to make loans to the trustee
for the bondholders for the purpose of
preparing to market the forest products,
and to invest some of its own funds in
any undertaking for the realisation of the
forests.
For bondholders, who are entitled to
the net proceeds of the forest products,
the critical period lies ahead. The realisa-
tion committee has submitted to counsel
draft proposals for the formation of a
co. in which “the owners of the raw
material will ultimately become owners
of the entire undertaking.” There is talk
of setting up pulp, timber and paper
mills, and the first units are expected to
be in operation by 1938. To do this and
create a selling organisation is pretty
certain to call for a hefty capital.
Details are to be announced shortly. It
is too early yet to say precisely what
the return to bondholders is likely to be.

•Includes reserve for unexpired risks.
For a 13-year-old it is a robust young-
ster, with a promising future. At the end
of March it had accumulated reserves
£10,054 in excess of paid capital, which
means that the two combined need net
only 3.3 p.c. to pay a 7 p.c. div. Actu-
ally interest and rents turned in £8421
(down £151), or 8.9 p.c. on capital, leav-
ing the surplus from underwriting avail-
able to swell investments and the re-
turns therefrom. The co. is thus in a
position to pay more than 7 p.c. out of
returns from investments alone; . the
cautious board is apparently waiting to
see where interest rates settle down.
On the underwriting side, the co. pulled
out of the troublesome, long-winded
London marine business a few years ago,
and the Montreal office was closed be-
cause of the unsatisfactory experience
there. Still, a smaller volume of more
select risks has yielded better results, as
the following comparison of underwrit-
ing figures shows:

Last year net premiums were £1644
better, despite aggressive competition,
which, together with initial costs in con-
nection with the Brisbane branch, opened
toward the close of the previous term,
was responsible for the spring of £1 Bs.
per cent, in the expense ratio. The
underwriting surplus was £4048 as against
£5459, a loss of £13,439, and surpluses
of £1402 and £2911 back to 1930. The
net return from all sources was thus 13.2

* Including unexplained additions to reserves.
This 23-year-old printing and publishing
concern turns out a number of trade jour-
nals. When the public became interested,
in 1926, £30,000 of 8 p.c. pref. money was
gathered, making paid capital £153,000 ;
also, subsidiaries were formed in Mel-
bourne, Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth to
take over the branches there. To finance
extension of their respective interests and
provide more working capital some of
the pups got in a little pref. money, too.
After paying its own pref. divs., the
parent’s net earnings for the four years
to the end of 1930 averaged 4 p.c. on
ord. capital, and a solitary 5 p.c. div.
was paid. Then slump brought losses,
and the prefs., which got half a meal
in 1931, have gone without for the last
two years. Prospects of their getting
back into the picture are, however, much
brighter than the last line in the table
suggests.
Last year’s gross earnings (£5125, im
eluding £742 received in divs.) were
£2054 better. Exes. (£3578) were
up £328, due to taxation and interest,
leaving £1547 net, or £313 less than a
full year’s pref. div. (6.2 p.c., after allow-
ing for the statutory cut). But, after
overhauling the accounts, £3087 was
struck off for bad debts, £326 was re-
served for doubtful ones, and £559
dropped out of reserves, leaving the final
balance £2425 on the wrong side. That
reduced the nominal lay-by to £31,110.
The financial position worsened:

Those who are looking for rich returns
from the timber trade had better look
the other way. Certainly the co. has
met with more than the ordinary diffi-
culties of the industry. To cover losses
in connection with the Patrick line of
steamships and the co.’s Fraser Island
(Q.) timber venture, £70,000 ( = ss. per
share) of capital was jettisoned in 1925 ;
another Is. 6d. per share went the same
way three years later, and Is. 6d. was
returned in cash, leaving paid capital at
£176,819 in fully-paid 12s. shares.
Still, the figures are indicative of the
general experience in the trade of recent
years, when plant has been unable to get
enough work to cover the cost of manu-
facture and distribution, plus inescap-
able fixed overhead charges. Last year
turnover was 86 p.c. better, but competi-
tion was so aggressive that the co. was
able to squeeze only £l5B of profit out
of the year’s larger trading—the first half
showed a loss of £713, and the last half
a profit of £B7l.
It is difficult to say when divs. are
likely to flow again. Excluding the de-
preciation reserve (£28,574), £35,775 of
the capital was unrepresented by tan-
gibles at the end of March, and another
cut in capital is to be made when con-
ditions in the trade become more settled.
There is nothing to worry about in
the finances:

The year’s improvement in the more or
less liquid surplus (£65,036, including
stocks but not shares) was £227. Much
depends upon the condition of plant, etc.
The market prices the now fully-paid
12s. shares at 4s. 9d. as against 2s. 6d.
a year ago. It thus values the under-
taking at £71,000-odd less than its net
book value, excluding the depreciation
reserve.
Placer’s New Deal
Placer Development has exercised its
option over the Pato mines, Colombia
(S. America), controlled by Oroville
Dredging, the English concern which
also holds a wad of Bulolo scrip, and
which recently became interested in the
Talbot deep leads (Vic.). A new operat-
ing co., Pato Consolidated Gold Dredg-
ing (nom. cap., 2,000,000 dollars in dollar
shares), will take over the properties,
dredges and other plant, etc., for a mil-
lion paids, of which half will be allotted
to Placer and the other half to Oroville.
The two holding cos. will put up what-
ever working capital is required in equal
amounts. Placer, which will control the
business will hand the old Pato Co.
$12,500 in fully-paid Placer shares or the
cash equivalent, for a purpose not yet
stated; it will also pay the old Pato Co.
£30,000 (sterling) for certain virgin
ground, subject to satisfactory test re-
suits, the vendor having the right to sub-
scribe for pi acer shares (at market price)
to the same amount, thus keeping the
money in the family. Placer and Oro-
ville have also agreed to remain in double-
harness in respect of their future mining
activities in Colombia, which might be
taken to mean that more will be heard
of other properties presently. No details
of yardage, values, costs, etc., in connec-
t[on with the property taken over have
yet been sent out by Placer, whose pro-
minence in connection with the deal is
c | ue p ro gress it has made in the
technique of gold recovery.
Oroville (paid capital, £143,127) owns
all but a handful of Pato’s £lOO,OOO oi
capital, which figures in the parent s
books at £139,849. The pup, lormed in
1909 to treat 40,000 acres of alluvial on
the Nechi River, Colombia, °wns a
hydro-electric plant and a bucket dredge
with a capacity of 150,000 c.y. per month,
A few years ago it took the adjoining
Nechi Co.’s property and dredge for
£60,000, and has profitably worked the
lower river flats since.
For the year to Sept. 30 last Pato s
No. 1 dredge turned over 1,782,474 c.y.
(down 428,993 c.y.), the average value
being 12.82 cents as against IL9- cents
for the previous year. No. 2 diedge
handled 1,496,164 c.y. (down 296,431
c.y.) for an average value of 27.39 cents
as against 13.89 cents for the year betore.
The figures exclude the premium on gold,
Retreatment of old tailings accounted
for about 50 p.c. of the yardage handled,
Field costs for both dredges combined
were 9-77 cents, an increase of 2.6 cents,
due to lower yardage and taxation. The
net profit, was £106,291, or 106 p.c. on
capital.

Bayley’s Reward Group, Coolgardie
(W.A.), where an extensive diamond-
drilling campaign has been planned, little
work has been done below 300 ft., where
refractory ore proved to be troublesome
in the past. But recent developments
have solved many old recovery difficul-
ties. At the Eureka, 30 miles n.e. of
Pine Creek railway station (N.A.), two
shafts are to be sunk to 400 ft., where the
ore-body will be proved by diamond-
drilling. The sulphides come in at 160 ft.,

tally and to 360 ft. vertically, says Tor-

ing has been done below the 136 ft. level,
and the recorded output is 379,787 tons
for 193,244 fine ounces of gold. Half a

the full width of the drive, and occasional
richer patches have been since opened up.
The 3s. 9d. paid shares soared to 41s. in

of a rich strike on the Imperial’s blocks

QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(1) A applies for a prospecting area on
country controlled by the Forestry Commis-
sion in N. S. Wales, but omits, to peg.
B a few days after inserts pegs and applies
for the same ground. Who has the prior
right ? (2) Prospects of a rise in the market
price of copper ? (3) Are copper shares a good
investment ? —1827.
(1) If the land referred to is on a forestry
reserve, it is not open to occupation under
miner’s right or as an ordinary prospecting
area, but any person can apply for a prospect-
ing area under Section 17 of the N.S.W. Mining
Act, 1906. A sketch of the area applied for
should be attached to the application to enable
the land to be identified, but it is not necessary
to take possession under Regulation 6 of the
Act for the purposes of Section 17. (2) and
(3) A pronounced and early rise in the market
price of copper seems very unlikely.
Concerning beach sands on the North Coast
of N. S. Wales: (1) What publications are
available ? (2) Any cos. working the deposits ?
(3) Plant used for concentrating ? (4) Analysis
of the sands ? —1919.

N. S. Wales Department of Mines. Price
Is. Id., including postage. (2) Metal Recover-
ies, Ltd., is prospecting, and trying to find
an efficient method of separating the three
principal constituents —zircon, ilmenite and
rutile. (4) Two samples showed the following
approximate mineral composition:
Specific
A. B. Gravity.
Zircon .. .. .. 78 p.c. G 4 p.c. 4.7
Ilmenite 10 „ 9 „ 4.5-5.0
Rutile 9 „ 18 „ 4.2
Tin oxide .. .. 4 „ 6.4-7.1
Monazite .. .. . . 3 ~ 5.0
A—From between Richmond and Little rivers.
B—From two miles south of Little River.
In some samples monazite has been found to
constitute 34 p.c. and tin oxide 26 p.c. of the
whole. The difficulty has been to obtain con-
centrates of commercial value, due to the
sporadic distribution of the mineral contents
and to difficulties in manipulation.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
S.M.: Send a sample of the tin-bearing
material to the Department of Mines, Sydney,
giving particulars of the exact locality
H.8.T.: (1) The co., which is developing the
Hall, McKenzie, Stevenson and Nicholson
leases, has met with some very rich ore in the
oxidised zone (900 tons yielded 27000 z.), where
the reef is faulted. The future of the show
depends upon developments in the sulphides,
where the ore-body appears to be more regular.
(2) We have no records E.T.C.: (1) Not
recommended. (2) The control is right and
prospects are satisfactory, though only mod-
erate divs. need be looked for for a while....
J.S.: No connection between the two. The
first one went out of existence four or five
years ago J.M. and R. 5.8.: (1) Hold for
a while. (2) Oil Search... .F.W.S.: Oriomo
holds 404,000 shares in Oil Search and a one-
fifth interest in Oriomo Explorations. Drillers
is an offshoot of Oil Search, which holds
potential oil-bearing areas in New Guinea. The
Explorations Co. is interested in the Melawi
G9M Syndicate and in Mt. Charlested Wolfram
Mines... .T.H.D.: Not recommended.


SHADOW SHOWS.
“The Wandering Jew”
This British picture, at Melbourne
Athenaeum, doesn’t need to be historical,
since it is founded on a legend. The
present version, based on Temple Thurs-
ton’s novel, records how Mattathias spat
on the Saviour at Calvary because He
had told him that the way to make his
mistress well was to send her back to her
husband. He is condemned to walk the
earth until the Messiah returns. He
appears as an unknown knight at a
mediaeval tournament, and after demol-
ishing a number of champions he seduces
a Christian lady while her husband is
being murdered by his servant outside.
After the lapse of centuries he turns up
in Seville as a Jewish doctor who works
without reward amongst the poor in an
age when all identified Jews were burnt.
He espouses the cause of a courtesan, is
betrayed by another Hebrew and goes
to the stake. The fire is lit, the heavens
are overclouded, the flames die down ;
they are relit and a ray of mysterious
light relieves Mattathias from his cursed
immortality.
Conrad Veidt does his best in his
monosyllabic way to give the character
significance, but fails for lack of raw
material. How a man might feel after
having lived for 1000 years, with the
prospect of living another millennium,
has never been worked out. Would he wish
to beget children, only to see them grow
old and die while he remains perennially
in his prime? Would he approach his
100th love affair with the same interest
as his first? Would his unexampled ex-
perience of the fact, which observers of
humanity have perpetually to discover
for themselves over and over again, that
man is born to repeat the errors and fol-
lies of the past make him a hater of
mankind, like Swift, or an indulgent
laugher, like Anatole France? These are
vital questions to which the film gives
no answer. So one wishes the Wander-
ing Jew the speediest possible release
from his punishment.
“Voltaire”
Ignorance of Voltairean history was
bliss at Melbourne Capitol on Saturday.
Voltaire was not in Paris during the
Calas affair. The judicial murder which
caused a convulsion in Europe similar
to the Dreyfus case came to the old
pamphleteer’s ears when he was in Swit-
zerland, and he got the details from
members of the family who had taken
refuge in Geneva. He didn’t secure the
rehabilitation of the family by hiding
Madame Pompadour behind a curtain so
that she could listen to the seditious
utterances of a courtier. He wrote to the
King of Prussia and the Empress of
Russia and. stirred public opinion until
he had all Europe taking sides. He
didn’t frighten Louis into repentance by
staging a play on the event under that
monarch’s nose. It was the Parlement
of Paris which took over the case and
quashed the verdict of the Toulouse
magistrates after old Calas had been
broken on the wheel. Nor did Voltaire
regard its action as a triumph for the
people’s love of justice. When he entered
Paris like a god 12 years later and a
friend said “What a crowd to meet
you!” he replied, “There would be just
as many to see me on the scaffold.”
Yet as a melodrama of action, with
some overtones of character, “Voltaire ’
stands high. George Arliss is not only
extraordinarily like the marble portraits
of Voltaire, except for the mouth; he
conveys the complex character surpris-
ingly well for an actor hitherto prone to
somewhat sentimental stereotypes. He
shows Voltaire’s vanity, his lust for
power, and the mixture of philosopher
and demagogue who turns his fight for
the people’s rights into a duel between
himself and the king. He is seen dodg-
ing his doctor and running the risk of
the Bastille in order to write his pam-
phlets, which are tossed to an agent in the
street to be circulated underground, and
this gives a true dramatic picture of the
character of the times. The story moves
with great force against the background
of approaching revolution, and Voltaire
becomes a figure of genuine power and
real humanity. Pompadour (Doris
Kenyon) combines feminine charm with
intelligence, and Reginald Owen’s Louis
has intelligence and dignity.
“I Adore You”
Here we have Margot Grahame as the
chief charmer in a cinema co. hobbling
the affections of a rich young im-
becile. In the good old days it used
to be a Puritanical father who stood in
the way of the fulfilment of love’s young
dream. Now it is a fat, cigar-chewing
producer and a five-year starring con-
tract that delay the nuptials for the
requisite hour and a half. The rich
young man buys up the show for half
a million pounds and, by tearing up the
contract, removes the impediment. Miss
Grahame is vivacious and good to look
upon, the display of leg is on a suitably
lavish scale, and there is some excellent
comedy.
“Tembi”
Yet another wild-animal film. It is a
record of a 12,000-mile journey through
Darkest Africa. There was sufficient light
in Darkest Africa for the cameramen to
capture a wide range of savage and
curious beasts. The lion is a particularly
brilliant catch, and the negro-hunter who
shoots poisoned arrows into pythons is
a polished movie star. His magical
ability to lure a tribal god in the shape
of a crocodile from its haunts would
have been more impressive if the god
hadn’t had such an obvious relish for
dead fish.
“The Fortunate Fool”
At Sydney Lyceum, supporting Gracie
Field’s “Love, Life and Laughter.” A
philanthropic novelist with plenty of
money wanders round the Thames Em-
bankment in search of characters. He
finds two —an old pug and a destitute
typist—and instals them in his flat. The

SYDNEY TALKIES.
fighter can’t stand respectability and
leaves. The lady likes it, but leaves also
—she finds out her benefactor has a
fiancee. You can guess the rest, but it’s
told amusingly. The only fault is in the
stiff acting of the ladies.
“Bolero”
A Sydney Prince Edward film with
one of the unhappy endings which be-
came fashionable at Hollywood recently.
Poker-faced George Raft is a coalminer
whose soul is set on hoofing. After a
disastrous debut he lands a job in a
beer-garden, lives laborious days and
nights, eschews drink and doesn’t make
love to his partners. So to Paris,
where he meets Carole Lombard. The two
start on an impersonal basis, but gradu-
ally drift towards an attachment. Enter
an English peer who wins the lady. At this
stage war breaks out, and Raft, thinking
the trouble will be over in a week, en-
lists in the Belgian Army as a publicity
stunt. After the Armistice he goes back
to dancing, but his disabilities kill him
on the eve of a triumph.
Raft contributes an interesting study
of a man with a one-track mind, and the
various women—Carole Lombard, Sally
Rand, Frances Drake and Gloria Shea
—whom he regards as dancers only, have
been well cast.
“Girl without a Room”
A good-tempered slap at freakish art
and its exponents. Charles Farrell, of
Tennessee, wins an art scholarship. In
Paris he becomes associated with indi-
gent daubers who sneer at his orthodox
paintings and impose upon his generosity.
An exception is Marguerite Churchill,
who despises the cranks and befriends
the innocent abroad. Only when Miss
Churchill neglects him to play the good
Samaritan to a dipsomaniac does the
hero desert representationalism to turn
vorticist. In between the production of
monstrosities he showers his precious
francs on a mercenary model.
He comes to his senses when one of
his paintings, acclaimed by the brethren
as a masterpiece, is exhibited upside
down. By this time Miss Churchill has
been cold-shouldered by the drunk (a
chivalrous fellow when sober), and is
ready to be taken back by Farrell.
Charles Ruggles, as a jovial dilettante,
has most of the fat. His scrimmage with
an athletic female model, his terror at
having to fight a duel and his actions as
an uninvited guest are extremely funny.
“The First Mrs. Fraser”
St. John Irvine’s play, now on view
as a film at Sydney Mayfair, has most of
the faults of early British talkies. The
lighting is flickery, the sound effects are
poor, and so is most of the acting.
Henry Ainley, as the divorced gentle-
man who finds his second wife more
than he can handle and pines for his first,
is curiously feeble; yet everybody
praised his performance of the same part
on the stage. Joan Barry overplays Elsie
Fraser, and her make-up and dressing
are amateurish.
On the other hand, Dorothy Dix is
sound as the forgiving first wife, and she
gets good support from Hargrave Paw-
son, who plays the son.
“Cleaning Up”
An English comedy. George Gee is
the brainless son of a domineering aristo-
crat and hawks vacuum-cleaners for a
living. One of the big laughs is the
scene in which he is mistaken for a
doctor who has been called to attend a
confinement case. There is another when
he is forced to pose as the husband of
an actress so that an elderly admirer may
escape exposure.
Finally he strays, into a theatre and on
to the stage, and is taken by the audi-
ence to be one of the cast. So the man-
agement gives him a contract.
Others who participate in the hack-
neyed affair are Betty Astell (actress),
Dave Burnaby (peer), Alfred Wellesley
(henpecked fool) and Barbara Gott
(jealous wife).
“The Ninth Guest”
The devisers of this Sydney Capitol
thriller went to all sorts of trouble to
make the events recorded explicable, but
it remains to the end something as re-
mote from life as a marionette show. A
college professor who was sacked for
telling the truth about the wealthy crook
who endowed the uni. sent anonymous
telegrams to seven people, against all of
whom he had a grudge, inviting them to
a party in a penthouse. He also sent an
invitation to himself. On arrival the
guests found they could not leave
because the iron gates leading to the
apartment were charged with high-volt-
age current. A voice from a radio
cabinet harangues them and says that
one person will die each hour. The
wealthiest of the crooks invited —the
uni.-endower—decides to poison the
whole assemblage with prussic acid, a
bottle of which has been left on the
mantelpiece, but scratches his thumb on
a poisoned stopper and dies at 10 p.m.
The remaining guests get quarrelsome,
and in a scuffle crook No. 2, a political
boss, gets shot at 11 p.m. At midnight
a society matron, also a crook, passes
out. After some more deaths, the hero,
Donald Cook, who is supposed to be
both a millionaire and a reporter, over-
powers the college professor, and pro-
duces from the learned man’s pockets
overwhelming evidence of guilt. The
prof, lets Mr. Cook and Genevieve Tobin
out and then electrocutes himself on his
own trick door. A hooded apparition
which is a feature of the posters doesn’t
appear on the screen.
“Emperor Jones”
The Bulletin’s Melbourne critic has
already delivered an opinion on this
travesty of O’Neill’s play. Robeson, his
acting and his mighty voice are the only
justifications for it.
“Gallant Lady”
An Ann Harding film at Sydney
Regent.
She is an expectant mother whose
aviator-lover was killed before he had
time to marry her when she encounters
Clive Brook as a down-and-out physi-
cian. Brook looks after her and has the
infant adopted by Otto Kruger and Ivy
Merton. He also gets her a job as an
interior decorator, and then drifts out of
the picture on a five-year spree.
She is a very cheerful lady by the time
Brook returns. Then the complications
start, and enable her to be gallant and
self-sacrificing and generally noble —a
task, for which she is eminently fitted by
appearance, manner and voice.
All the principals give good perform-
ances, and the child is unobjectionable.
“Finishing School”
Here we are introduced to a college for
young ladies which specialises in de-
portment and etiquette. The students
behave correctly in the presence of their
teachers; not so when they get to their
rooms.
Frances Dee begins by being ostracised
for primness. But she soon falls into
their ways, joins a week-end drinking
party when she is supposed to be visiting
friends, gets tight, and is landed in an
awkward situation with an amorous
youth (also tight) when the hero (a doctor
acting as a hotel waiter) surges to the
rescue.
Miss Dee, Bruce Cabot (manly lover)
and Ginger Rogers (undisciplined pupil)
are good enough, and Billie Burke
(scatterbrained mother) is very good
indeed.
“Bombay Mail”
At Sydney State. A defect is the im-
pression it creates that India has
gone American. Edmund Lowe is sup-
posed to be a British sahib who takes
charge of the mail when our old gangster
friend Ferdinand Gottschalk (the Gov-
ernor of Bombay on this occasion) is
murdered. Mr. Gottschalk boards the
train wearing the sash of an order, and
heightens the bizarre effect by draping
it practically round his stomach. Hedda
Hopper, as his wife, is more like a
Chicago mayoress than a vice-reine, and
whatever the nationality of Ralph
Forbes and Jameson Thomas may be
they are not in the least like British
A.D.Cs.
Otherwise “Bombay Mail” is an accept-
able thriller, with corpses materialising at
fairly short intervals, and a touch of
originality in the form of a doctor who
is travelling with a cobra in his hand-
bag. The cobra bites a passenger, who
is rejected as the murderer by close
students of this class of entertainment
only because his appearance and behavior
are suggestive of guilt.
Much the best feature is the photo-
graphy. The cumulative effect of the
sounds, the rushing train seen from
various angles and the dim wayside
stations is to make the onlooker feel that
he is following the mail in an aeroplane.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Nepa” (Lakekamu Goldfield, Papua) :
I’ve often heard that Innisfail (N.Q.) is
the wettest spot in the world. If so, how
would this place be classed? Last
year’s rainfall totalled 362 inches, with
November as the wettest month (54.36
inches); one shower in this period—it
lasted for an hour or so —registered
9.7 inches. Lowest rainfall recorded for
a single month was February, 1934, with
17.8. As a general rule, the monthly
fall hovers round the 25-inch mark. This
year looks like breaking last year’s figures
with 122 inches to its credit up to the end
of April. I don’t think any part of the
globe is in it for rain alongside Lake-
kamu.
“If I catch you flirting again with that cockatoo I'll make you laugh the other
side of your face.”
“El V.”: Andie, the Melbourne Zoo’s
giraffe, is dead, and it will cost £5OO to
import another. Nature was unjust to
Australia in not giving it an indigenous
giraffe, an ideal heraldic beast for a
democracy. The giraffe is the only animal
that hasn’t hollow legs ; he is pure bone
from the ankles upwards. His camouflage
is more artistic than any statesman’s,
and his thick hide in some species will
turn a bullet. A plenitude of giraffes
would be good for our equestrian repu-
tation —no nation would be able to chal-
lenge our supremacy as the champion
giraffe-riders of the world —and it would
lend a new zest to the lives of Aboliars,
who, apart from inventing a new horde
of giraffe fibs, would be able to indulge
in endless speculation about giraffe
habits. The old African debate as to
whether a giraffe will attack a lion could
be rehashed into a fierce argument as
to whether they eat lambs. And the
flapper press would benefit immensely.
Think of the sales the poster “Bull
Giraffe Bites Beautiful Society Girl”
would mean!

“Chatham”: A few months ago Bris-
bane saw a revival of the ancient sport
of cockfighting. Regular fights were
held in the suburbs, at which hundreds
of enthusiasts attended. But the sport
got into the papers, and that was the
end of it. Now birds which were bought
at £9 each are unsaleable, and some, in
desperation, have been sent to Sydney,
where sportsmen are supposed to come
at anything.
* * * *
In defence of a maligned bird:
“W.A.C.”: * “Poddy’s” Vic. jackasses (B.
23/5/’34) are too civilised. At Glenban station,
near Maryborough (Q.), I heard great excite-
ment among the jacks. About 50ft. up a
tree, the middle one of three, was a hollow
bough with about 12 inches of a green tree
snake hanging out. The jacks, one at a time,
flew, full speed ahead, from the first tree and
grabbed the snake as they passed, coming to
rest in the third tree. Seven birds did this;
the snake came out a little each time. The
eighth bird brought the wriggler to the ground,
and the rest got to him.
“Van Diemen”: Went to investigate a loud
tapping in the bush in the Speck recently and
found Jacky trying to quieten an 18-inch
crawler by hammering him on a fallen tree.
Eve’s cobber had his head tucked away under
his enemy’s wing, and it seemed likely that
Jack would lose the number of his mess. At
my approach the bird dropped his intended
dinner and flew to a dry limb, where he stayed
for the remainder of the day, his feathers all
fluffed out, looking a very sick fowl. Next
day he was laughing as gaily as ever.
“Bryan”: At Ballina (N.S.W.) Jacky caught
a 3ft. brown snake, which he demolished by
taking it up a high tree and letting it fall; but
when attempting to swallow the snake the
kooka could only manage half and choked
to death.
“F.H.H.”: At Rockley (N.S.W.) I sat for
an hour and watched a kooka kill a brown
snake about 3ft. long. He grabbed the
wriggler behind the head, carried it into the
air for about 20ft., then dropped it, and as
soon as the snake hit the ground the kooka
had him again. Jacky repeated the perform-
ance until the snake was dead as Julius Cresar.
“A.G.F.”: At Chatsworth Island (N.S.W.) I
found a jacky with the head end of a 3ft.
tree snake in his inside; about a third of it
had been digested. At Byron Bay in 1902
one doing a similar performance was brought
into Jack Banner’s shop and left till the tail
disappeared in three days’ time.
# * * *
“Tufi”: “Milne Bay” (B. 6/6/’34) is
running late when he says there used
to be no night navigation up the n.-e.
coast of Papua in the old days. Small
craft frequently carried on after dark,
especially after clearing Cape Nelson,
when the coral patches thinned out along
the run to the Mambare. One instance
on Whitten Bros.’ old oil-launch Bulldog
is recalled. Before turning in with his
passengers, “Peter,” the Scandinavian
skipper, put the usual cardboard pointer
on the desired compass point and told
the native steersman to keep it on the
lubber’s mark. The evening had been
festive, and all slept soundly, including
the steersman. When the skipper woke
at dawn the launch was tuff-tuffing along
in-a glassy sea. Far astern was a patch
of land that subsequently proved to be
the top of Goodenough Island, while
there was evidence of a dim mountain
range to the s.-w. As the skipper gazed,
a thin wisp of smoke emerged from the
top of a spike of land. It was spiralling
upwards, as always on calm mornings,
from Papua’s only volcano, Mt. Victory,
and told us that we were well on our
way to New Britain.

“Nikko”: “Cauboy’s” tale of the
bacchanalian orgy at Yea (Vic.) in which
“What you need, of chap, is a passionate love affair.”
bees of both sexes participated (B.
23/5/’34). is scouted by a N.S.W. bee-
master. He says decisively that the
revellers were all ladies, if one could
call them so. The female of the species,
who runs the hive in bee land, has the
male so securely in the hollow of her
hand that he can’t feed himself. If he
could collect and absorb his own menu
there would not be each year the ghastly
rite of the eviction of drones ; those not
maimed in the riot are kept out of the
hive to perish of starvation. Gynocracy
in its fiercest form is the order in
apiarian circles.
* $ * *
“Segnalpa”: There are queerer aids
to navigation than the bellowing of cows
or the yelping of dogs (B. 16/ 5 / ’34).
During a fierce gale I once made
a passage through the Basilisk
Channel, in the centre of the
Warrior Reef, Torres Strait.
This reef runs almost north and
south, with a slight bend where
the channel is. The tide was
with our native-manned cutter,
but the wind was against us,
and it was a pitch-black night.
In the actual passage, which is
about a mile wide, all was a
chaos of tiderip and breaking waves. As
we beat up into the wind, Simeon, our
native skipper, would call “About ship,”
and off we would go on another tack.
Apprehensively, I asked Simeon how he
knew when to alter the tack. “Oh, that’s
easy,” he replied; “reef is coral, and so
I smell him.”
* * * *
“Spare Walton”: No need to argue
whether or not fish always swallow other
fish head first (B. 6/6/’34), since the
reason is apparent to anyone taking the
trouble to reflect. Let any doubter try,
as an experiment, to swallow the tiniest
tiddler tail first —that is, against the dorsal
and other fin spines—and the truth will
dawn upon him long before the ambu-
lance arrives.
* * * *
“Powlathanga”: “Ben Nevis” and
several others (B. 16/5/’34) prove that
my supposed rarity the flying mouse
is in reality almost a pest in other dis-
tricts. Very well; for the honor of the
Burdekin Tableland (N.Q.), let me stack
“Larrapinta” and a few others up against
the barking lizard. This chap is found
west of Pentland in the big timber coun-
try towards the Burra. He is lOin. to
Min. long, with a frill about his neck
and a wide mouth which, when open, is
black as Old Nick’s bedroom. He is
chameleonic —takes the color of his sur-
roundings. A dopy sort until roused,
he then shows his fighting spirit, rearing
on hind legs, swinging a tail knobbed
akin to the tongue of a bell and looking
like a bad dream come true. He will bark
like an asthmatic pomeranian, snapping
and jerking in his fury, and fairly spitting
steam and flames. Is his bite poisonous?
By the look of him, I’d say he’d give
a deaf-adder owe forty and a love set
when it comes to venom. One of them
nearly killed me. I wasn’t quite as smart
as I thought—or perhaps the lizard was
quicker than I allowed —and, what with
fright and bad whisky, it took me a
couple of days to recover.
* * * *
“Kali”: These stories of outsizes in
snakes, and “I have the skin to prove it,”
won’t wash with me in future. Up at
Sydney Museum the other day I dis-
covered that skins when dried stretch
nearly 50 per cent, without showing any
appreciable diminution in girth. One
skin I handled came from a 10ft. carpet-
snake ; after drying it went 14ft. 6in.
* * * x *
“Wandi”: Even Binghi sometimes
dyes his hair —and his whiskers. For this
purpose the northern blacks use the ash
of the wanghi, or Queensland plum-tree,
mixed with water. After a few applica-
tions the hair assumes a gingery color,
like the coiffure of a Fijian beau. The
wanghi is one of the valued trees of the
abos., and was long ago protected, like
the bunya pines, by the Queensland Gov-
ernment, chiefly on account of its fruit,
which looks, when dried, somewhat like
a dried prune, and has a date-like taste.
The blacks never damage the trees in any
way, even when climbing for the fruit.
The material for the hair dye is obtained
from dead trees or fallen dead limbs.
The wool is not used for ordinary camp-
fire purposes, but is kept for festive occa-
sions.

“Agamemnon”: Can anyone beat this
stock-mortality record? We had 660
head when we left Wee Waa for Walcha,
all strong and active. After a droughty
trip they rushed the water at Gunnedah,
and were then put on pastures contain-
ing the variegated thistle. Within 12
hours 500 were crow meat. Only about
130 survived.
VANISHED HOMESTEADS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Resting-place of lost romances, those old
homesteads by the river!
Here is one, with cattle camping ’neath the
hardy pepper-tree
Planted in the good old days our fathers
thought would last for ever,
Wlien the shepherds lined the frontage wtih
their big flocks running free.
There’s a single chimney standing, where the
trace of smoke still lingers,
But the old slab walls have fallen and are
overgrown with grass,
While the broken palings seem to point like
gnarled and twisted fingers,
And the garden is a-litter with old tins and
broken glass.
You may faintly trace the bush course where
we held the shearers’ races,
And the horses and their riders in your fancy
visualise,
Hear the thunder of the finish, glimpse the
beaming bearded faces
When the bets were plug tobacco and a
bridle was the prize.
There were dances at the “cut out,” and the
neighbors all came over,
Lads and lasses blithely riding from the
homesteads small and great;
Fifty miles was little matter for a horse that
grazed on clover,
And the reins were rarely tightened as they
loped from gate to gate.
There are rabbits in the stockyard where the
wildest colts were ridden,
But the posts and raik are leaning, charred
and blackened, from the straight;
Bushfires here their toll have taken, but their
work is partly hidden
By a kurrajong that’s growing, green and
glowing, at the gate.
Gone are rouseabout and shearer; tough old-
timers of the stations
Rolled their swags and faced the sunset as
the flocks spread further west;
Most by now are soundly sleeping at their
final destinations,
Gathered in the last Great Muster, gone to
their eternal rest.

“G.G.6”: England, in spite of its
addiction to hunting and other sports in-
volving the slaying of birds and beasts,
can claim probably the crankiest collec-
tion of people opposed to what they call
“blood sports” outside the Jain com-
munity. This curious crowd recently
barracked strongly for the Protection of
Animals Bill while it was before the
Commons; it prohibits “rodeos” and
similar exhibitions, and restricts trained-
animal stunts. Of interest to Aus-
tralians is that the boxing kangaroo
will box no more, because boxing is “a
practice foreign to all its natural in-
stincts.” Writer can certify that boxing
is old man kangaroo’s “middle name,” as
the spielers used to say, when in the
wilds. Two old men will spar for half
an hour at a time for an opening to get
in the k.o. with the hind legs, and the
arm- and headwork shown would do
credit to any trained human. In fact,
there is no need to train a kangaroo in
actual sparring, though lessons in deport-
ment and observance of the social con-
ventions may be necessary.
* * * *
“Agamemnon”: Most of the Council
seem to nominate the sheep as the most
thickheaded and obstinate of animals,
but cows take a lot of beating. We
missed old Strawberry from the river
paddock. Searching proved unavailing,
and not till a fortnight later did we find
her—dead-—in one of the back paddocks.
The old milker had tried to walk through
the split trunk of a large tree, but found
the Mae West curve of her hipbones too
much. Instead of backing out, she had
struggled further and further in until
hopelessly jambed.

“St. Aignan’s”: Sydney journals have
been arguing about the double cocoanut
of the Seychelles, known as the “coco-
de-mer.” For a long time it was found
only on the shores of the Maldives, an
island group west of Ceylon, and it was
supposed that the palms which bore it
grew under the sea. The sultans of the
Maldives made the nuts a royal prero-
gative, and sold them for medicinal and
“Would you allow me to paint that old cow, sir?”
“Which one?”
magical purposes all over Eastern Asia.
Then the French navigator Sonneret,
voyaging to New Guinea, discovered the
Seychelles. He found the islands he
landed on covered with the palms bear-
ing the double cocoanut. That was in
1743, but not until years later was the
truth about the undersea cocoanut
known. General Gordon wrote a book
to prove that the Seychelles were the
original Garden of Eden and the “coco-
de-mer” the forbidden fruit. That being
so, Eve must have been a hefty lass,
since the nuts weigh up to 501 b. each.
Sir William MacGregor made a valiant
effort to introduce the nuts to the Louis-
ades, but his scheme was wrecked by a
feminine appetite, as has been told else-
where.

“J. E. Mac.”: Though at first sight
the black cockatoo (B. 30/5/’34) seems
very destructive as he tears at the gums
and wattles he usually haunts, he is one
of our most valuable friends. He is the
forest warden among the birds, tearing
out and destroying insect larvae, grubs
and other timber-destroyers.
* * * *
“Hatch”: I can swear to having seen
a rabbit at Camooweal (B. 6/6/’34). I
picked him up, and some of his friends,
on Burt Plain (N.T.) years ago, appar-
ently at the end of a northern expedition.
They were so lean
and weak that they
could be caught on
foot and they were
reduced to gnawing
the bark from the
boles of the mul-
gas. Partly out of
pity and partly
with an eye on
the commissariat,
I made a box for
some of the youn-
ger fry and had
fed them into
something like
sleekness by the
time we camped
beside Lake Fran-
cis. Then a local
cattle-dog discov-
ed them, broke
into the box,
scragged one bunny
and let three others
go. If there weren’t
rabbits there before, I claim the local
monument as their introducer. I need
something as compensation for carting
them a thousand miles and then losing
them just as they were fit for baking.

“C.C.”: “Flight Feather’s” description
of the crow (B. 23/5/’34) shows that he
has a long-distance acquaintance with the
wily birds. Although superficially the
crow is as black as the raven, the lower
or downy part of the crow’s feathers is
pure white, while that of the raven is
dusky-grey. Nor are “white eyes
common to both” ; the raven has white
eyes, those of the crow being hazel. To
bush folk either bird is “Kelly” the out-
law, to be shot on sight: the raven for
his attacks on weak and defenceless
animals, the crow because he is the
worst of all nest-robbers.
* * * *
“Peu”: lam interested in a newspaper
statement that Sydney’s Taronga Park
Zoo is feeding its birds of paradise on
fried grasshoppers. The journal de-
scribes this as the “natural food” of the
birds, though I have yet to see one with
a fryingpan in its claw. For some years
I lived in a district of B.N.G. where para-
dise birds were as thick as their cousins
the crows in a western Queensland dry
season. These birds live, in the higher
branches of the very high jungle trees,
and only the native snarers know what
goes on there. But from what they have
told me there is no food in those tree-
tops resembling the chap who is de-
scribed in Holy Writ as a burden. In-
deed, in the jungly country of which I
am writing, I cannot recall a patch of
grass which would give half a dozen
hearty South African locusts a square
feed. Before the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment took over B.N.G. 1 kept several
specimens of Raggiana intermedia in an
aviary. They lived mostly on boiled rice
and bananas, and seemed quite comfy.
Years later, invited to inspect a ship-
“Don’t pick it yet, sir. I’ve got quite an affection for that melon."
men t of paradise birds bound for New
York on one of the Canadian liners from
Sydney, I found the chap in charge feed-
ing them —many of kinds new to me —
on fruitcake, chopped apples, bananas
and other oddments. Fried grasshoppers
were not on the menu.
*•* * *
“Val”: If some of the New Shark
Wales doubters care to accept my invita-
tion for a Sunday cruise on the Derwent
(I’ll supply the petrol if they supply the
bottles of lunch), I’ll show them a few
specimens of 10ft. tiger-shark, and pos-
sibly a grey nurse or blue-pointer.
Although sharks are often taken close
to Tas. swimming beaches, attacks are
rare. They come down with the warm
East Australian current, which turns east
from the Tas. coast near the Schoutens,
thence flowing to Maoriland. But, should
sharks swim through the Dunalley Canal
into the colder water of Blackman’s Bay,
they find their way into the estuary of
the Derwent before regaining the open
sea. Their sluggishness is attributed to the
cold water. Perhaps this and good feed-
ing make them turn down their noses at
“long pork.”
* * * $
“Mark VI”: Will some tame mathe-
matician, kindly calculate for me the odds
against anything like the following hap-
pening again? Shooting at Port Mel-
bourne rifle-range, a marksman was
firing his first shot when a ground-lark
rose from the grass 100 yards in front.
The bullet, travelling 1853 ft. per second
at that distance, made a mess of the tiny
bird, which, curiously enough, was big
enough to divert it—the missile never
landed on the target.
* $ * *
“Homfrey Beale”: I see “King T.” (B.
30/5/’34) revives the yarn that the scrub
turkey or mallee hen young emerge from
the shell fully feathered and able to fly.
Eighteen months ago I uncovered a couple
of chick-inhabited mounds. The fledglings
are just as helpless (and featherless) as
any other chick at hatching, and remain
in the fine-dust core of the mound for
between 14 and 21 days, when they
scratch their way out, reasonably plum-
aged. Their pas and mas they never
see again, except by accident. A thin
cord runs from the navel of each newly-
hatched bird to the inside of its vacated
shell, which is coated with a glutinous
substance, and through the cord the
sticky stuff is absorbed by the bird’s
digestive machinery. The cord shrivels
progressively as the birds near full
feathering; its dropping from the body
is Nature’s signal to them that they are
ready to appear in the Grand Guignol
of life.
“Herbert D.”: What scrub-turkey
chicks can do is run like blazes. Up
to the time of the youngster’s emergence
from the heap of rotting leaves the nest
is guarded—generally by a cock bird or
two. As each chick wriggles his way
out he takes a long breath, stretches out
afterwards and thus gave me the
idea. A couple of the species lent to
the Gordon Highlanders would make that
great fighting regiment forswear pipers
for ever and start every Scottish bat-
talion in the world cabling for more
music. The cats would inevitably make
over the border into Westmoreland as
soon as they acquired Scottish tendencies,
and we could then sell our expert know-
his neck and goes for his life. Even a
grown bird is a poor flier.
* :)'• * -fi
“lan Mac Mull”: Let me into this wild-
cat argument (B. 6/6/’34). 1 don’t care
whether our so-called tiger-cats are in-
digenous or not; they are the foundation
for a great industry. When I shot a 12-
pounder which had mauled my cattle-
dog in Centralia a decade ago, his missus
held a wake or a wedding a night or so
ledge to the English to rid the country
of them. Royalties from gramophone
records for Arab consumption—bush
pussy has every Hedjaz singing-girl licked
hollow —would be a fortune in them-
selves ; indeed, there are endless oppor-
tunities for the development of other
avenues of disposal. The only reason I
have not gone into the business is that
there is so much to be made in promoting
goldmines without gold.
* * * #
“J.D.H.”: Water can be obtained from
the root of one species of the mallee
scrub (B. 16/5/’34). The roots of
other species are as devoid of it as the
sand they grow in. The thirst-quencher
is usually a larger tree than the general
run, and branches out into three or four
limbs about a foot from the ground. I’ve
seen these water-bearing mallee in S.A.
and Westralia, but never in N.S.W.,
where most of the other species are
common.
“Travel Stain”: A Bowen (N.Q.) horse
was taken to the village smithy for re-
shoeing only once ; after that, when it
cast a shoe or felt that one was getting
down to the upper, it made off of its
own accord to get the thing adjusted. It
was usually correct in its judgment, too.
* * * *
“Aplanges”: “Birkdale” (B. 16/5/’34)
and “Bogaduck” (B. 9/5/’34) have still
to learn something about Australian
shellfish. Torres Strait natives eat the
flesh of the giant clam; the huge mass
of animate jelly and muscle will live for
days, even while steaks are being cut off
it. A large variety of cockles, about
nine inches across, is also collected in
the mangrove mud. They are known to
the natives as akul. I tried them cooked
once. I’ll order motor-tyre and sole-
leather next time, if I have to choose.

' “G.C.”: Motoring along the lonely
road from Burketown to Camooweal, I
saw a signboard in a most unexpected
spot. It read:
ADEL’S GROVE.
Store, Garden and Repair Shop.
Blacksmithing, carpentry and saddlery
undertaken here. I buy, sell or exchange
horses, vehicles, etc., marsupial Skins and
botanical, zoological and scientific speci-
mens. Motorists catered for. Good fish-
ing and sport.
A bark hut in the distance attracted me.
The owner was about to sit down to a
meal of corned beef and damper. After
lunch, he showed me his large garden on
the bank of a fine stream. I bought a
watermelon and some pawpaws and de-
parted, promising to recommend his
place to friends in Melbourne.
A WINDY SUNSET.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A flight of starlings over the stubble,
Wheeling as one, without a fault ;
Sweep of the storm-wind, bending double
The sapling boughs in its fierce assault.
Even the flying cloud is flurried,
Scudding down heavens desolate;
Swiftly the short June day is hurried
Out of the sunset’s amber gate.
Only the bleak hill’s angry vastness
Shouldered against the streaming wind;
Grey smoke, flung from a chimney fastness,
Levelled to naught and left behind....
The birds are gone and the light is going,
Night swoops forward on wings of grey,
With a wind from the darkness blowing,
blowing
Out the guttering flame of day.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE 'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL.
BLOWFLY TRAPS.
“Granova”: Here are two chief blow-
fly traps that have proved effective:
Hang a kerosene-tin in a tree close to
where the sheep water. Place one to two
gals, of water and arsenic in the propor-
tion of 7 to 1 in the tin and throw in a
rabbit or piece of liver small enough to
float on the surface. Cut slits about
wide down the sides of the tin from the
water edge upwards.
The flies perch in the slits and drink
the water. Do not allow the water to
get below the slits or the flies will fall
into the tin and foul the bait.
Remove the side' of a kerosene-case and
place it with the open side on little blocks
on the ground. Leave enough space
below to let flies pass in. In the top of
the box cut a hole 6in. across and place
over it a funnel of gauze, about 6in.
long, pointing upwards, with a small hole
at the point. Place another case with
side removed on top of the first case. In
the top of this case cut a hole about
7in. across and cover it securely with
glass or gauze. Place a bait, liver or a
rabbit, in the bottom box. The flies enter
at the bottom, and when they seek to
escape will fly upwards through the
funnel to the light and will circle round
the glass till they die.
BUILDING A WOOLSHED.
“Dead Finish”: Set the line of the
shearing-shed as near to the travel of the
sun as possible ; i.e., east and west, mak-
ing allowances for your normal shearing
season. By keeping this well in mind
you will effect a substantial saving in
material, which in many sheds blocks
out the sunlight.
Put the pressroom at the eastern end,
the full width of the building from n.
to s. The woolroom will come next, in
the centre —the whole width again—
with the wool-bins running e. and w.
back to the pressroom. From here, the
shearing-board should start, and go on
the southern side, from the woolroom to
the western end. The penning-up race
will be on the northern side, correspond-
ing to the shearing-board, and with
catching-pens for shearers between. The
letting-go pens go out on the south side.
By working to this plan the minimum
of material is needed. Allow sufficient
overhang of the roof covering the shear-
ing-board and back race, and you will
only need to wall-up to about 3ft. 6in.
on these sides. (Should your shearing
date be in the dry part of the year,
battens, similar to hurdles, will do for
walls.) This gives maximum light, with
the added advantage of not having to
flog sheep up a dark race, after coming
from the outside brightness.
The board, on the southern side,
allows shearing to be carried out with-
out interference from sunlight—an im-
portant item.
Many sheds are built with spacious
pressrooms, mainly used to stack bales
of wool, while the most important job
—the get-up of the clip—has to be car-
ried out in a confined area.
The smallest number of wool-bins should
be eight, two of which will be used by
the piece-pickers, with an old woolpack
slung up for their stained pieces. The
front of the piece-bins should be boarded
up from the floor, to a height of about
a foot above the piece-picking table.
Thus you prevent locks and unpicked
wool from getting into the bins. The
table should be hard against its bins.
Every care must be taken to provide
the classer with the best possible light. I
do not favor a skylight, provided there
is enough subdued side light. A shed set
out north and south gives atrocious cross
lights to a classer.
Build the wool-bins of battens, run
horizontally and spaced about three
inches. This allows an excellent sub-
dued light to reach the classing-table
from the pressroom behind.
By placing the pressroom at the eastern
end you provide the pressers with a cool
room during the long, hot afternoons.
SYNTHETIC WOOL AND
ORGANISATION.
“Valerin”; It is to be hoped that “El
V.’s” warning about synthetic wool (B.
6/6/’34) will make our Woolgrowers’
Councils take notice. In Europe years
ago I saw laboratory samples which gave
me, as a grazier, an uneasy feeling. Ever
since I have feared the time coming when
scientific workers would stumble on the
secret of something more menacing than
wool substitutes.
It is unsafe to assume that synthetic
textiles will prove complementary to and
not competitive with merino wool. In
these days of economic nationalism, Gov-
ernments are only too ready to encourage
the local production of necessities on a
cheap synthetic basis.
Growers of merino wool have no
worth-while overseas organisation. The
recent fall in wool values is disturb-
ing, and it is futile to dismiss it as a
passing phase. We don’t know definitely
why it is or what it portends. The wool
position is statistically sound. Why the
slump?
QUALITY AND EXPORT.
“H.U.C.”: The necessity for export-
ing only high-quality and properly-
graded products has lately been em-
phasised by the plight of the Aus-
tralian wheatgrower. A demand has
grown for special types for specific
purposes. The enforced use by legisla-
tion of a certain proportion of home-
grown soft wheats in European countries
has effectively decreased the demand
for lower-quality grain from exporting
countries. Australia has ignored this
fact and has continued to mix wheats of
all milling qualities, dubbing the mixture
f.a.q.
The system sets a seasonal standard
only.
The fact that it cannot be fixed till
February delays trading operations, and
naturally the European buyer takes this
uncertainty into account when bidding
for the Australian product.
Farmers are not encouraged to grow
better-quality wheats, because export
marketing conditions are so haphazard.
Premiums have been paid on Dundee and
some other varieties by local millers, but
the amounts are strictly limited and only
serve to emphasise the need to sell on
grade.
It is probably not an exaggeration to
say that sometimes the f.a.q. system
encourages the production of rubbish. If
the sample contains straw, chaff, etc., so
much the better for the farmer, provided
the bushel weight is up to the f.a.q.
standard. There are farmers who avoid
producing a sample considerably above
f.a.q. by regulating the harvesting
machinery so as not to clean the grain
properly.
It is small wonder that while this goes
on we are losing our grip on the markets.
GALVANISED BURR.
“Wen”: The graziers have had
droughts, bushfires, floods, flies, mycotic
dermatitis and numerous other itises,
also worms (in sheep), prickly-pear and
a host of other things to contend with in
their efforts to keep the pastoral indus-
try afloat. Now they have a new pest —
galvanised burr.
It resembles roly-poly, but is the color
of galvanised iron. Stock won’t eat the
thorny rubbish, and it grows prolifically,
especially on red ridges. It does not
appear to do so well on black soil, al-
though it will spread here also.
Warialda and Moree (N.S.W.) P.P.
Boards and Shire Councils have watched
its behavior with considerable alarm, and
the other day Warialda P.P. Board passed
a resolution seeking the co-operation of
all local-governing bodies in having the
pest declared noxious throughout the
State and urging that it be made obliga-
tory on private owners to destroy it
on their properties. Boolooroo Shire
(Moree) has already proclaimed it
noxious within its boundaries.
Getting rid of galvanised burr is a
problem, for pear poison and arsenical
compounds do not seem to kill it.
Although burnt an inky color by poison,
it will come along again as soon as it
gets over the shock. Cutting it down
spreads it, because the mattock or hoe
knocks the brittle stems into a myriad
pieces, any of which may take root and
give birth to a new plant.
The remedy suggested by one well-
known grazier is to burn the plant where
it stands.
POTASH DEFICIENCY.
“Sandon”: “The Lad,” in advising
farmers how to look for signs of deficiency
of potash (B. 16/5/’34), goes too far. His
first three danger signs, viz., (1) a yellow
tinge in young leaves, (2) leaf edges dis-
colored, (3) irregular development or
general weakness of the crop, may equally
be signs of deficiency in the other essen-
tial plant foods, nitrogen and phosphates
and lime.
A yellow tinge in young leaves is more
likely to be a sign of nitrogen deficiency,
and the ashen-grey-colored grass which
dries off quickly is more than likely to
be deficient in phosphates.
A sure test for potash is the way
leguminous crops thrive in the soil. You
may be sure that land which grows good
mangolds, potatoes and other roots,
lucerne,- etc., is not potash-deficient.
The best test of the lot is to send a
soil sample to the Agricultural Depart-
ment for analysis.
SHRUB ATTACKED BY RUST.
“H. Jaye”: Although wheat rust is
not usually a serious disease, it cost
over £2,000,000 in N.S.W. alone in 1916.
It has been intensively studied by Dr.
Walter L. Waterhouse at Sydney Uni-
versity for the past 15 years. Dr. Water-
house’s most recent contribution bears
on the occurrence at Yetholme, near
Bathurst, of wheat rust on an introduced
shrub, the common barberry bush—the
fW natural occurrence noted in Aus-
tralia.
The fact that the rust fungus requires
the presence of the barberry in order
to complete its life-cycle was proved only
about 70 years ago, although as early
as the eighteenth century farmers in
Europe and America suspected that this
plant was in some way responsible for
the rusting or “blasting” of their crops.
These suspicions led to the passing of
laws for the extermination of the shrub.
The Barberry Eradication Campaign of
the U.S.A. Agricultural Department has
operated for over 16 years, and the eli-
mination of this undesirable plant has
resulted in a considerable reduction of
rust loss.
Even when the rust fungus is unable
to complete its normal life-history,
through the absence of barberries, it
lives on certain grasses and on stray
wheat plants. But, as Dr. Waterhouse
has discovered, the barberry can cause
much more trouble than as a mere
host for the disease: when the spores or
seeds of different strains of wheat rust
infeQt the barberry hybridising can take
place, producing new strains of greater
virulence or parasitic power. This puts
an entirely new light on the importance
of eradicating barberries, which, though
not prolific here, may grow to be.
CLAY.
“R.X.8.”: Clay has a share in the make-
up of most farming land, especially in
areas well above sea level. It is queer
stuff—a liability that can be turned into
an asset. It is seldom the bogey farming
textbooks say it is.
If a farm stands on a clay foundation
it is good if the clay bed is more or less
level and at a depth of about three feet,
because the clay holds water for a long
time and prevents plant foods being lost
by sinking. The land will need a drainage
system if it is not on a slope to carry
away the excess water, and it will be pro-
fitable to plough deeply to break up the
top of the clay bed.
But clay beds are not usually level.
They undulate so that they enter the soil
belt and result in the land becoming a
light-, medium- or heavy-clay loam. In
the first class, 40 per cent, of clay in
the soil gives it body and richness, and
increases its capacity to hold water. If
there is 60 per cent of clay, it is medium.
More than that constitutes a heavy-clay
loam that can become too wet, sticky, too
dry, cold and hard to handle. That classi-
fication is mine.
The percentage of clay can be decided
by heating soil dry. Powder it by crush-
ing, tip it into a clear glass bottle of
water and shake well. After standing a
few days, the top layer will be clay.
If more than 60 per cent, of clay is
present, the soil must be handled with
respect if good results are to be had. The
first essential, if the land is flat, will be a
system of drainage. The next will be
thorough working. Ploughing, rolling
and harrowing must be done, not when
you are ready, but when the land is.
Lime is indispensable to a clay soil.
Five bags to the acre will work wonders.
But the best thing I know for making a
medium- or heavy-clay loam kind, rich
and warm is turning in a green crop—say
Japanese millet. Apart from the manure
this will supply, clays are rich in plant
foods, anyhow, and especially in potash.
Once plant life is established in clay
soils it is carried along vigorously. Deep-
rooters will always thrive. If the per-
centage of clay is below 80, well-worked
land on the given lines will always pro-
duce a good cereal crop. Above that it
would be best to work it for grass, though
fruit trees, especially apples, plums and
pears, like to get their feet into clay.
PIG CANNIBALISM.
“Cockyson”: “Poddy” is too sweeping
when he says a sow properly fed and
kept in good condition will never eat
her young (B. 25/4/’34). I have known

sows, comfortably housed and fed on the
best of protein-containing and nourishing
foods, such as maize, pumpkins, boiled
and raw', and skimmed milk, to gobble up
their young directly they were dropped,
the sows being in the pink of condition
at the time of farrowing. It has always
seemed to me that the sow that eats
her young is abnormal, suffering from
the stress attending parturition, which in
turn produces a disordered appetite, with
a craving for raw flesh and blood. If
a sow can be prevented from eating her
young until the discomforts following
parturition have disappeared, she can
usually be left safely with her litter, even
if she has eaten her young before. But
very few give the offspring-eating sow a
second chance.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“W.M.8.”: Always choose banana
suckers with pointed leaves. Cut off
all roots, and dip the ends in boiling tar.
This should give you bigger and better
bunches.
“Dad”: In roof or building always
put the sheets of iron on in threes, the
two outer sheets placed either under or
over the middle sheet for one and a half
corrugations. The building will then be
proof against rain, wind and sunlight.
“Mimosa”: In shearing ewes it pays
to watch that the blades or shears do not
snip off the hairlike skin appendix which
appears like a thread on the extremity of
the vagina. If this is lacerated a thicken-
ing or hardening follows. Then at
parturition, the ewe being unable to de-
liver the lamb, both die. Similarly, if a
teat is cut, it may also callous and be-
come blind. Result, no milk to feed the
lamb.
“McL.S.J.”: Pigs love kurrajong, but
don’t leave the boughs in the yard after
they have eaten the leaves, as the twigs
and bark are both tempting and fibrous
and you may have complications if the
grunters eat too many. Don’t let them
have too many seed-pods, either, as
the little hairs that surround the seed
cause an irritation in their throats and
stomachs.
“Rockajah”: Bolts in unseen places on
farm machinery, such as under the up-
rights supporting the seat of a disc har-
row, are apt to cause a nasty fall if the
thread strips. Any bolt which has to
withstand stress may be held tightly and
indefinitely by drilling it just behind the
nut and inserting a split-pin. Screw up
the nut as far as it will go, then mark
the thread on the bolt just behind it,
allowing for the thickness of the pin.
Then unscrew and drill.
“Spring”: To deal with earth tanks
that will not hold, get as much fine clay
as is needed to spread over the bottom
and up the sides to a thickness of about
4in. Then, when rain comes and the
clay is soft and wet, work a mob of sheep
backwards and forwards over it. Their
feet will puddle much more effectively
than you can.
“Pick”: Better than a rake for smooth-
ing the beds is a home-made garden
harrow. At 45 degrees, and centrally, set
a broomstick into a 12in. by 2in. plank
3ft. long. Brace the handle with wires
twisted between it and the plank corners.
For teeth use 6in. nails. Start holes for
them in regular rows at angles of 45
degrees, drive them through the plank
and stub them off 3in. below.
“Jumbuck”: Careless trucking methods
which cause defects can be easily avoided.
Keep the dogs tied up or muzzled. Don’t
grab the sheep by the wool or poke them
with sticks. Use a long, light pole on
the end of which is placed a wide rubber
ferrule. If the latter is not available, bind
plenty of soft cloth around the end. To
raise down sheep, use a crook. The
horns or a leg should be grasped in the
hook.
“0.X.0.”: Try this for cracked heels
in horses: Poultice the heel to subdue
inflammation and to make the sebaceous
glands function. Then apply 20 drops of
carbolic acid rubbed down with one
drachm of oxide of zinc ,(in powder
form) and made into an ointment with
lard free of salt.
“Werrimee”: A fence post that is split
down the middle need not be taken out if
the wood is sound. Strap it near the top
with No. 8 wire and twitch tightly. Or
draw the two parts together with a
small clamp and bind them with a piece
of hoop-iron. Or put a thin bolt through
the post.
“Karaway”: A handy vehicle for carry-
ing bagged produce from field to barn
is a home-made truck or trolly with low
block wheels (sawn off an ironbark log
about 9in. in diameter). It is quicker to
load than a cart and saves heavy lifting.
With a movable frame it is also con-
venient for carrying pumpkins, and for
transporting pigs if there is a good road.
“Pick ? ’: For Hitching in the sawpit,
chopping out sleepers or squaring girders,
a line-marking color is made by mixing
the black ash of burnt stringybark with
sweetened tea. If thoroughly saturated
the line along the timber will grow
plainer as it dries, will not dim in the
wind, nor wash off.
Home-made leather for
bridles and straps? Here’s the recipe:
Place the hide in a barrel or large milk-
can and cover with a full bucket of
burnt lime mixed with water. Soak for
ten days, turning frequently, and then
spread out on a floor (concrete if pos-
sible), and scrape off the hair. Clean the
hide by soaking it for ten days in a
bucketful of bran and water. Next, soak
for another ten days in a solution of
101 b. salt, 101 b. ground alum and loz.
oxalic acid mixed with water. Turn the
hide at frequent intervals. Lastly, tack
the hide on the wall and stretch it as
tightly as possible. When dry it is fit
for use.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
( Transferred, from Service DepartmentA
(1) Is flour bleached in Australia ? (2) Is
bleaching legal ? (3) Process used when ozone
is the bleaching agent ? (4) Process when nitro-
gen peroxide is the agent ? (5) If not carried
out in Australia, the names of countries where
bleaching of flour is necessary ? —1674.
(1) Yes. (2) No, it is not legal. (3) So far
as can be ascertained the ozone process is
not used in Australia. (4) Nitrogen peroxide
is made in small quantities by passing air
through an electric arc. The mixture of air
and nitrogen peroxide is blown into the flour
stream. (5) Bleaching of flour is not neces-
sary. It is permitted in the majority of coun-
tries, but some prohibit it.
(1) What family does the pistachio nut belong
to and is it a tropical fruit.? (2) What soil
suits it ? (3) Where can plants be obtained in
Queensland ? (4) When is seed best planted ?
—lBl4.
The pistachio is a tropical nut —one of the
Anacardiacece. It thrives best in fertile, loamy,
well-drained soils. Plants are not obtainable
locally, but could probably be purchased
through the Director of Agriculture, Peradenya,
Ceylon, or from Cramer and Zoon, Wonosobo,
Java. Seed is best planted during spring, and
plants during winter.
Please state the different processes wheat goes
through to make white flour? —1610.
White flour is produced by an elaborate
system of roller milling. The wheat is first
thoroughly cleaned and then conditioned. This
process involves the addition of moisture. The
wheat is then allowed to stand in bins at
room temperature or passed through a heat-con-
ditioner. This toughens the bran, and enables
it to be more easily- removed from the starchy
endosperm, and also modifies the endosperm
itself and improves baking quality. The de-.
gree of improvement effected depends upon
the method of conditioning. Passing to the
“break” rolls, the wheat is crushed, liberating
a certain amount of flour and irregular frag-
ments of endosperm known as coarse and fine
semolinas. After the final break, generally
the fourth or fifth, there is practically no
flour left upon the bran. After each break,
the stock is separated into various fractions
according to fineness. These fractions are
then crushed on the smooth “reduction” rolls,
yielding flour and pollard (which are separated
by silk bolting cloths). The pollard consists
of fine bran particles and lumps of germ,
together with a certain amount of flour which
cannot be removed without lowering the
quality of the main product. The flour may
or may not be artificially bleached. Should it
be unbleached, a month’s ageing is generally
necessary before the baking quality is satis-
factory. Bleached flour may, hoWever, be used
immediately with the best results, the bleach-
ing not being in any way detrimental to the
flour.

I am considering poultry-farming as a liveli
hood. What are the results of the Hawkes
bury (N.S.W.) College laying competitions in
1933-34 ? —1983.
The official figures stated that the 9035
dozen eggs laid by 540 hens yielded £438 6s. Id.
which, after deducting feed and costs, left
£270 3s. 4d., or about 10s. per hen. Feed
used was 3574 bushels wheat, 1914 bushels
crushed maize, 341| bushels bran, 9|cwt.
M. meat-meal, 2981 b. salt, 511 b. Epsom
salts, 23cwt. shellgrit, 6834 bushels pollard
and 81cwt. green food—the cost of which was
estimated at £l6B 2s. 9d. It must be remem-
bered, however, that the birds were from
picked breeding-farms. The breed averages
were:

LEAVES FROM THE PAST.
V. — Melbourne and Adelaide Happen.
For the first 50 years of Australian
history there were no inter-State cricket
matches, conventions or jealousies.
Sydney had no one to be jealous of and
there was no other place to be jealous
of Sydney. Then Melbourne and Adel-
aide came. They happened quite un-
obtrusively and, to Sydney’s way of
thinking, rather deceitfully. For a long
time they weren’t there, and then, all ol
a sudden, there they were.
Several people had seen Melbourne at
the beginning of last century, but until
Mr. Batman came no one thought of
turning the blacks out of their wurleys.
Batman gathered a few of the dullest-
looking abos. around him and offered
them several tomahawks, shirts, pocket-
knives and handkerchiefs in exchange for
considerably more land than he really
needed.
Thinking it was the Yarra he wanted,
they agreed. Having remarked “This
is the spot for a villa,” he sailed off to
get his architect to draw up the plans.
This was a big mistake, because Mr.
Fawkner sailed up and brought his archi-
tect with him, and built his villa on the
spot.
The Government thought Batman’s
price was too high, but they didn’t
get the handkerchiefs back, and when
Fawkner opened a pub on the corner
Batman realised that he was a jolly good
fellow. He built a villa near by and
stayed, too. A lot more people came, and
soon they were in a position to be able
to send a cricket team to Sydney. After
the first victory over the Sydneysiders
the settlement seceded from N.S.W., and
the two States have been divided by the
River Murray and public opinion ever
since.
Adelaide was born about the same
time as Melbourne. It was very lucky
to be born at all. Colonel Light designed
the whole place in London, and then
came to Australia to help Governor
Hindmarsh found the city. There was
considerable argument as to who should
found it. Finally they decided that Light
should find it and Hindmarsh should
found it. Light then went all over S.A.
looking for a place he could fit his map
into, and finally decided on the present
spot. He pointed and said “Put it
there,” and Hindmarsh hastily declared
the city duly founded. Light’s statue is
still a perpetual source of annoyance to
mothers who are trying to bring their
children up properly. He will point.
South Australia and Victoria are dif-
ferent colors on the map, but there is
nothing else to separate them. They are
joined together by a very peculiar rail-
way. When the train steams out of
Spencer-street station it is known as the
Adelaide Express, but by the time it
reaches Adelaide it has changed its name
to the Melbourne Express. Closest
observation has so far
failed to reveal just where
it changes its name. The
engine-driver and guard
probably know, but train-
men, like doctors, don’t
tell.

RUGBY FOOTBALL.
Football must not be
confused with boxing.
There are more players ;
and biting is barred in
boxing.
Football is so called be-
cause when there are no
opponents or referees
handy the ball is kicked.
There are usually two
sides and a referee ; some-
times just two sides. The
player nearest the pub is
called full-back. It is the
aim of the forwards to
beat him to it. The others
are named according to
their sizes, like hats, e.g.,
three-quarters, five-eighths, etc.
Free-kicks were introduced to satisfy
Scottish players, and scrums are just like
women’s bargain sales.
Scoring is done by tries. Whoever tries
hardest wins ; the others try again.
The main idea is to maim opponents
and tear their clothes off. At exciting
moments the referee barracks with his
whistle, but no notice is taken of him.
At each end of the field are goals,
which represent safety zones. Players
biting each other or throttling the re-
feree in goal are allowed to go off the
field after being cautioned. This Ss
called “off-side.” There are several dif-
ferent kinds of goals, such as penalty
goals and no goals, but they all look the
same.
The referee decides when the game is
over and therefore gets a good start to
the railway station.

AN OBVIOUS OBJECTION.
“Why worry if yop are taxed exces-
sively?” shouted the religious speaker.
“What does it matter if the price of
amusements goes up? Theatres, races,
dances—you can find better things than
these. Follow me. I’ll prove to you that
the best thing in life is free—free for
you and for everyone.”
An inebriate standing by the soapbox
protested sadly.
“I don’t believe it,” he said ; “a bloke’d
never be able to get into the pub.”

OUR VERSATILE CRICKETERS GO
TO THE DERBY.
“The majority of the team was faultlessly
attired in morning dress and grey toppers,
some specially acquiring them for the occa-
sion.” — “Sini.”
“Although hosts of spectators wore silk
hats and morning-coats, the Australian
cricketers, who dislike formal clothes, dressed
in lounge suits and felt hats.”— “Herald.”
Both reports are, of course, hopelessly
incorrect. The cricketers, in accordance
with the usual practice of Australian
teams when attending race meetings in
England, were dressed in the rough
woollen jackets and moccasins of the
typical Australian bushman. Blucher-
boots, a sombrero hat, bowyangs, a Sam
Browne belt and a colored neckerchief
completed the outfit, which evoked
murmurs of admiration as the team
strolled nonchalantly into the Royal
Enclosure.

AWAKENING.
Ten million spots danced before his
eyes, and the village blacksmith played
a tune fortissimo in his head. Where
had he been last night? He shuddered
as a motor-horn blew raucously in his
ear. He entered the court and slumped
into his seat at the reporters’ table.
“Silence in the court!” The usual
string of drunks, he supposed.
Amid the babel of sound racking his
head, a few coherent sentences came to
his ear. “William Bates —disorderly-
creating a disturbance guilty two
pounds—costs.” He jotted it down auto-
matically. He wished he knew what had
happened the previous night. Sup-
posed somebody had put him to bed.
Then his jaw sagged ; he gaped be-
wilderedly at the sergeant.
“John Penn. John Penn.” The voice
faded away. “The facts, please, ser-
geant. Drunk —resisting arrest—bail
allowed”
He shuddered, and there was a further
blank as the hammers rose to a cres-
cendo. Then he glanced at his notes.
“John Penn. Drunk. Bail estreated,
10s.”
Realisation flashed upon him. He was
reporting his own case.

PETITION .
Star of my life two years ago,
How could / know your love would
die —
That you might burden me with woe,
How could I guess or prophesy ?
I sorrow that we’ve reached the state
When life with me brings you distress.
I grieve that love has turned to hate,
And bliss gives place to bitterness.
Alas, you cannot mend my heart —
Of that there is no earthly chance —
But, darling, please, before we part,
I beg of you to mend my pants!

Manner of fishing for black bream; tackle,
baits, etc., used ? —1779.
The hand-line is preferred. Use a No. 2 or
No. 3 gut, terminating in a yard or two of
transparent gut cast; the hook, a No. 1.0 or
No. 2.0 (Bartlett B 7215); a bullet sinker is
attached about one inch above the hook. A
landing-net is necessary. Bait may be prawn
with head and scales intact, and fixed on hook
to appear as natural as possible. Mullet gut,
beach worms, and pipi are also used with suc-
cess. The line should be held very lightly and
the fish allowed to take the bait a yard or
two before striking. The best grounds are
usually found in proximity to oyster beds, and
the best burley is freshly-opened oyster-shells.
Bream find an oyster irresistible, but there is
considerable difficulty in securing the oyster
to the hook. Night fishing is most successful,

tung Leased Territory, the population in 1930
was 29,575,000, of which 112,137 were
Japanese. The number of Japanese increased
to 135,507 in 1932, and is not very far short
of 200,000 at present.
(1) What is quinine made from and how is
it made? (2) Is it soluble? (3) What are its
medicinal uses ? (4) What happens if it is
taken in excess? (5) Is it artificially prepared
by chemists ? —1974. .
(1) It is an alkaloid found in the bark of
the cinchona tree, from which it is obtained
by mixing the bark with milk of lime, treating
with boiling alcohol, and extracting the alka-
loid in the form of the sulphate by adding
dilute sulphuric acid. (2) The sulphate (usual
medicinal form) is soluble in 780 parts of
cold water, but is more readily soluble in
hot water and in alcohol. (3) As a tonic, an
antipyretic and a specific in malaria, in which
disease its value is most pronounced. It acts
as a stimulant to the nervous system, lessens
the amoeboid movements of the white cor-
puscles, and lowers the temperature if it is
higher than normal. ' (4) It produces ringing
in the ears, disturbance of the vision, head-
ache and irritation of the digestive tract. (5)
No synthetic substitute is available.
From what and how is caviare made? How
is it eaten ? Where is it obtainable ? —1993.
It is the roe of various species of sturgeon.
The best caviare, which can only be made in
winter and is difficult to preserye, is the loosely
granulated, almost liquid, kind, known in
Russia as ikra. It is prepared by beating the
ovaries and straining through a sieve to clear
the eggs of the membranes, fibre and fatty
matter; it is then salted with from 4 to 6
p.c. of salt- The difficulty of preparation and
of transport has made it a table delicacy in
Western Europe, where it has been known since
the sixteenth Century. It is eaten either as a
hors d’ceuvre, a savory or as flavoring to other
dishes. The coarser quality, in Russia known
as pajusnaya, is more strongly salted in brine
and is pressed into a more solid form than
the ikra ; it is packed in small barrels or
hermetically-sealed tins.
(1) Is it a fact that when General Pershing
reached France with the American troops during
the Great War he said, “Lafayette, we are
here” ? (2) What active service did General
Pershing see before the Great War ? —l9BO.
(1) No. The words were uttered by one
of Pershing’s staff. (2) As an officer in the
6th U.S. Cavalry he saw active service against
the Apaches in Arizona and the Sioux in the
Dakotas. He served in Cuba during the
Spanish-American war, and later in the Philip-
pines. He commanded an expedition into
Mexico in an endeavor to capture General
Villa.
(1) Who were the parents of Anne of Cleves,
fourth wife of Henry VIII. ? (2) When was
she born ? (3) Was she an attractive person ?
(4) How long did the marriage last ? (5) How
was she treated after the divorce ? —1982.
(1) John, Duke of Cleves, the leader of the
German Protestants, and Mary, only daughter
of William, Duke of Juliers. (2) September
22, 1515. (3) She had been brought up in a
narrow retirement, could speak no language
but her own, was not beautiful, had no accom-
plishments save needlework, and no dowry.
(4) They were married on January 6, 1540, and
divorced on July 9 of the same year. The
marriage was not consummated. (5) She
received lands to the value of £4OOO p.a.,
renounced the title of queen and spent the rest
of her life in England, dying at the age of 42.
(1) Is phrenology a recognised science? (2)
What is it based upon ? —1966.
(1) No. (2) It is based on the assumption
that “faculties” are localised in the brain,
and that these areas are in evidence on the
skull. It owes its vogue to the fact that out
of some three dozen “faculties” and their
combinations a professor of phrenology can
construct a variety of vague generalities, many
of which are bound to be endowed with
special significance by the subject.
(1) What does the term “jewels” mean in
watchmaking ? (2) What is the maximum
number of jewels a watch may contain ? (3)
What is the difference between white and
yellow gold ? —1905.
(1) That the pivots fit into bearings made of
actual jewels, instead of into metal or brass
bushings. (2) Twenty-four in a standard watch.
(3) In the alloy used for yellow gold there is
a certain amount of copper, while, in the
alloy used for white gold, nickel, silver or
palladium is used in place of copper.
7 desire to grow in Sydney golden and
yellow flowers for house-decoration purposes,
particularly in the winter months. What would
you recommend ? —1955.
Leptosyne . maritama, an annual with yellow
blooms, similar to marguerites, should suit
admirably. Set the plants out in February or
March in a sunny corner of the garden. The
blooms should be cut as they fade to keep
vigor in the blooms. Guinea Gold mari-
golds, Crown of Gold zinnias, Molten
Gold nasturtiums and Orange Beauty antir-
rhinums can also be planted, but are not so
useful. ,
Proper time to shift evergreen shrubs in a
Strathfield ( N.S.W .) garden?— l969.
Work should be done at once so that the
new root-growth will start before the spring.
Trench the soil at least a foot deeper than
the depth at which the trees will be planted. Get
as much soil as possible with the roots of
the shrubs (this can be assured by watering
heavily for a day previously to shifting), and
water after the shrubs are in position. Stake
the shrubs to cause straight growth. If surplus
limbs are shortened or thinned at planting
time it will help the shrubs to root and get
over the removal, particularly the older trees.
Where was the Siegfried line in France dur-
ing the Great War? —1924.
It was the name given by the Germans to
the line taken by their armies in France in
September, 1918. ft ran through Moeuvres,
Flesquieres, across the Canal du Nord, Havrin-
court, Trescault, Gouzeaucourt, Villers-Guis-
lain, and eastward of Hargicourt. The British
victory of Epehy, which was complete on Sep-
tember 18, led to the abandonment of this line.
(1) Is the red kelpie sheep-dog a pure breed
or a cross ? (2) Are the blue and red cattle-
dogs bred the same way, and have they any
dingo or fox in them ? —1839.
(1) It is a throw-back to the fox. The first
pair of fox-collies imported to N. S. Wales
from Scotland, in 1870, had a litter of pups
on arrival. Amongst the black-and-tan pups
was a little red one, like a fox. This is the
kelpie strain. Black-and-tan kelpies or blues
will sometimes throw a red. (2) The red-
speckled and blue-speckled cattle-dogs were
originated at Muswellbrook by a Mr. Hall in
1840. He imported some smooth blue Scotch
collies (“Merles”) and crossed them with the
dingo. Later breeders used the kelpie and
Dalmatian, and produced the present blue (and
red) cattle-dogs.
What was the festival known as Saturnalia ?
—1926.
It was a Roman festival in honor of Saturnus.
It began on December 17, and lasted for
several days, its object probably being to cele-
brate the end of the vintage and harvesting. It
was a season of rejoicing, merriment and
license, during which no business was tran-
sacted. Slaves were allowed freedom and dined
at their masters’ board.
(1) What was the “Roman de la Rose” ?
(2) Who was its author ? (3) Who was re-
sponsible for the English version ? —1933.
(1) and (2) A French allegorical poem written
in the thirteenth century, descriptive of the
love philosophy of the troubadours. The first
part was by Guillaume de Lorris, and the
latter and more extensive part by Jean de
Meung. (3) Chaucer translated it into Eng-
lish, but our version is generally admitted to
be by another hand. There is a modern Eng-
lish version by F. S. Ellis.
Can you tell me something about Mrs. L.
Adams Beck, the author, including a full list
of her books ? When did she die ? — 1934.
She was the daughter of Admiral John
Moresby and granddaughter of Admiral of
the Fleet Sir Fairfax Moresby. She lived many
years in the East and travelled in Little Tibet.
She wrote “The Ninth Vibration,” “The
Treasure of Ho,” “The Perfume of the Rain-
bow,” “The Way of the Stars” and “The Key
of Dreams” under her own name, and, under
the nom de plume “E. Barrington,” “The
Ladies,” “The Chaste Diana,” “The Divine
Lady,” “Glorious Apollo,” “The Splendor of
Asia” and “The Laughing Queen.” She died
in January, 1931.
What system of defence is used on the N.-W.
Frontier of India ? —1920.
The rough nature of the country forms the
main barrier to invasion. Frontier stations
are garrisoned by British and Indian troops
(cavalry and infantry) and native levies com-
manded by British officers, each station main-
taining a chain of outpost forts along the
border. Owing to the bellicose nature of
the border tribes, these are permanently under
active-service conditions. Aeroplanes are used
extensively. There is an excellent intelligence
system controlled by political officers with a
knowledge of the country.
What is the order of succession to the
British throne ? —1892.
The sons of the sovereign are in the order
of succession to the throne, and after the
youngest son the daughters, in order of
seniority. Thus after the Prince of Wales and
the Duke of York come the Princess Elizabeth
and the Princess Margaret, daughters of the
Duke of York, the Duke of Gloucester and
Prince George; then the Princess Royal and
her children; then, as his Majesty has no
brother, his sisters, with the children of the
eldest in preference to the second sister; then
the second daughter of the late Duke of Saxe-
Coburg (his eldest daughter, Queen Marie of
Rumania, having formally renounced on her
marriage all claim to the British throne). After
the Saxe-Coburg branch come those of Con-
naught and Albany. This exhausts the families
of all Queen Victoria’s sons. Next come her
daughters, beginning with the house of the
late Empress Frederick;, but, as this line has
the ex-German Emperor at its head, it is not
likely to succeed in any circumstances.
(1) What are jam-tin bombs ? (2) What is
a percussion bomb ? (3) What sort of bombs
were used by British troops in the war ? —1909.
(1) A home-made type, so called because an
empty lib. jam-tin is used as container. Top
is removed and a plug of dry guncotton with
detonator and time-fuse is inserted and tamped
with earth and shrapnel, consisting of any
small scrap-iron that can be packed tightly.
Fuse is ignited by match or cigarette and is
usually cut to allow five seconds between
lighting and explosion. (2) One which ex-
plodes on contact, as distinct from the time
bomb, in which explosion is regulated by
length of fuse or a mechanical device. (3) In
the early days British troops used the jam-tin
bomb. These included stick bombs (percus-
sion, rejected as dangerous to thrower), in-
cendiary bombs, guncotton bombs (for demo-
litions chiefly) and several types of hand-
grenades charged with T.N.T. or other ex-
plosives, ignited by friction (like a safety
match). These were affected by damp, and
ignition flash betrayed position of thrower.
The Mills bomb overcame those disadvan-
tages and was adopted in 1915. It is oval-
shaped, and detonator, etc., are protected from
weather and easily removed to render bomb
safe for transport. Explosive is ammonal, and
casing breaks up under explosion to form
shrapnel. These and rifle-grenades were chiefly
used by British forces.

good recipes, freezing alone should be all
that is necessary. The addition of a little

We have no means of knowing how the world's first. Winter
Cruise "passengers" were entertained, what comforts they
enjoyed, or how much they saw of foreign parts . . . But you
may have a delightful and eventful Winter Cruise on the
"ORAMA," early in August, to Papua through the Archi-
pelago of the Barrier Reef, or on the "ORONSAY," late in
August, to both the Solomon Islands and the New Hebrides.
Your ship, with First Class passengers only, will be like a
very comfortable hotel, but, each day, she will be in a new
setting—continually opening up fresh fields of interest.

“Chevroford”: A doctor, a taxi-driver,

Gabo lighthouse gone gay. It is now
one of the showiest monuments of the

visitors. Shortly after an improved form
of flood-lighting was installed on it, an
astonished old lady observed a man divest
himself of his clothing and, rolling
it into a pillow, prepare himself for
repose under the mauve and crimson
glow. He explained to a constable that
he thought he had reached his home.
Despite all the precautions, accidents
go on, and the reason is plain. The wide
sweep of the parade provides a speedway
along which motorists habitually propel
their straight eights at 40 to 50 m.p.h.
One cuts in on another just as the safety
zone is reached and the damage to all
concerned is done. There are only two
remedies. One is to make the safety
zone continuous wiTi the length of the
road ; the other is the revolutionary one
of railless trams picking up and dis-
charging passengers at the kerb. But the
Tramways Board is not of the stuff of
which revolutions are made.

“H.A.L.”: Curious are the unexpected
streaks of meanness which one is liable
to find in the most generous natures.
Old Alec is the wealthiest man in our
district ; he gives £5OO to local institu-
tions every year, and as much again
anonymously to other charities. He has
helped several of his former employees to
buy farms of their own. But in the
garden surrounding his homestead fruit
may rot and vegetables run to seed but not
as much as an almond-shell may the gar-
dener take, and the same ban extends to
the station hands. And old McJohndoe,
the local solicitor, worth some £20,000 in
real-estate investments alone, solemnly
bills for —and takes care to collect—any
deficient postage on letters sent to him
by clients. Yet he will spend no end of
money in fighting cases for poor people,
and has been a fairy godfather in the
way of paying university fees for promis-
ing but penniless students.

“THE BULLETIN” TO TEST CARS.
♦
WHAT THE INNOVATION MEANS TO MOTORISTS.
Although the eternal triangle in matrimony invariably
leads to heartburning and finally to someone losing a parcel of
cash, the eternal triangle in motoring, wherein both designer and
sales executive seek to woo the fickle public, seems to leave .all
parties grinning happily.
With sales chiefs stamping on the toes of designers in
.order to get one jump ahead of rival organisations, we have
reached an era in motoring wherein even the cheapest produc-
tion is, for all practical purposes, foolproof and reliable.
Every modern car is a highly-efficient
assembly, simple to operate, safe at speed,
comfortable under all road conditions
and freed from the innumerable petty
troubles so common in past years.
Furthermore, motoring, even for the
novice, is no longer an adventure, Mel-
bourne to Sydney within the day being
a commonplace event, and one hundred
miles before breakfast only serving to
prove the ability of someone to get out of
bed a little earlier than usual.
Granting that all cars are good,
some are undoubtedly better suited than
others for individual purposes. When
a buyer proposes selecting a new car, in-
volving an outlay of from £3OO to £6OO,
he naturally desires whatever unbiased
information concerning , its performance
there may be available.
Here is where The Bulletin test
course will prove its value to the
Australian motorist. As each new auto-
mobile or truck is placed on the market,
a personal test involving every important
feature will be made, and the data
secured published.
There are many reasons why this test
is both necessary and desirable in assess-
ing the merit of any new car. First, the
buyer seldom can spare the time, nor will
the salesman feel disposed, to take the
machine for a journey of more than 100
miles, though, as every experienced
motorist must know, any shorter test of
these highly-efficient modern cars is
merely a farce.
Second, while catalogues may provide
data as to maximum speed and petrol
consumption, an independent test, con-
ducted under standard conditions, is much
more satisfactory for everyone concerned.
Suspension systems cannot be thor-
oughly tried out on tarred or concrete
pavements around cities. As The
Bulletin test course includes every type
of going, including extremely rough and
waterworn hills, to be climbed at speed,
together with unmade red clay byways,
the efficiency of various types under real
service conditions can readily be deter-
mined,
Generally, The Bulletin test is de-
signed expressly to protect the motoring
public from exaggerated performance
data. As every competition driver knows,
it is possible with skilful tuning to boost
any individual feature.
The man in the street does not require
expert advice in such matters as body
types, colors or styles of upholstery—
the womenfolk usually make these deci-
sions—and, when all is said and done, the
final choice has little influence on per-
formance, maintenance or resale value.
What the man in the street does want
to know is what a standard stock car of
some particular make can do after being
thoroughly run in and driven under
normal conditions.
Stunt tuning is never to be feared over
The Bulletin course, for the very good
reason that, even if attempted, over-ail
performance must suffer. Petrol con-
sumption, maximum speed, rolling, slow
running, acceleration, brakes and hill-
climbing are each to be the subject of
separate and distinct tests. The driver
who elects to establish a low petrol con-
sumption for some particular car may
get away with it, but inevitably maximum
speed, acceleration and hill-climbing will
in each case be slower than with stan-
dard setting of the carburetter. Again,
the driver with a flair for speed who
departs from standard tuning must cer-
tainly pay the penalty in both slow-
running and fuel-consumption tests.
With cars becoming faster each year
and free-wheeling frequently incorpor-
ated as standard equipment, discriminat-
ing motorists have begun to appreciate
the vital importance of good brakes. So,
while every effort will be made to have
brakes in perfect adjustment before sub-
mitting to test, it would be futile to have
them “binding” in an effort to shorten
the stopping distance, for by doing so
coasting, petrol consumption and speed
would be adversely affected.
Extremely slow speeds in top gear are
perhaps of little interest to the average
driver, but in conducting tests a slow-
running section is essential, first in order
to determine the inherent flexibility of
the power plant, and, second, to prevent
excessive ignition advance in attempts to
increase maximum speed.
It must be abundantly clear, therefore,
that, faced with such a comprehensive
series of tests, drivers of cars submitted
will see the wisdom of leaving standard
settings severely alone. Consequently the
data secured should be identical with
those obtainable by the man in the street
under normal conditions of operation.
Furthermore, with such a wealth of
accurate information available, potential
buyers will be saved a great deal of
time and inconvenience should they desire
to make performance comparisons in any
particular group.
Improving the Breed.
Racing improves the breed in motoring
as well as horseracing, and superchargers
as an aid to high speed have been in use
now for a number of years. Generally,
any successful unit or accessory fitted to
racing cars is in the immediate future in-
corporated in those of mass production,
but in this regard the supercharger has
flopped. Aiming at further improving
the stock car, the authorities controlling
next year’s Ulster T.T. —one of Britain’s
classic events —have issued an edict ban-
ning superchargers on competing cars.
No doubt, some consternation will be
caused in the ranks of British and Con-
tinental racing drivers, but in the long
run the incident will be forgotten, and
the true sports car, together with the
family sedan, will benefit accordingly.

This done, distances are carefully
measured and sections over which sub-
sidiary tests are to be made, such as
slow running, acceleration, flying mile
and rolling, must of necessity be sur-
veyed for purposes of accuracy, and
finally permanently marked.
A car is submitted to The Bulletin
for testing. The fuel tank is filled
to capacity and, together with driver and
observer, is taken to a public weighbridge
—this information is necessary in order
to calculate the ton mileage in fuel con-
sumption.
Before setting out on the course proper
a test is made of the braking equipment
from a speed of 25 m.p.h., and the
method of puffing up and distance taken
duly recorded. Turning circle on both
right and left locks are next measured,
this information showing immediately the
degree of handiness in parking or
manoeuvring in congested areas.
Setting out then on the actual course,
time of departure* is noted. Leaving
Sydney the route selected passes through
busy city traffic via Ryde to Parramatta.
During this 15-mile section one secures
an idea of handiness in traffic, together
with smoothness of engine and trans-
mission.
Continuing then over undulating coun-
try to Windsor, a test of coasting is con-
ducted. Here the car, commencing at
a steady speed of 15 m.p.h., is put into
neutral and allowed to roll of its own
momentum until finally coming to rest,
HOW CARS ARE TO BE TESTED.

AN OUTLINE OF THE PROCEDURE.
Casual motorists are prone to believe that the testing of
a car is a simple business in which driver and observer set out
on a simple hundred-mile run, take a few speedometer readings,
check up times at odd places, call at various inns along the route
and return in high glee to record the results of the trip.
Actually, the test decided upon by “The Bulletin” is a
serious and exacting business, involving an enormous amount of
preliminary work in selecting a route which, while reasonably
near at hand, must incorporate every type of roadway.
the distance covered again giving a rela-
tive idea of the freedom or otherwise of
the various transmission details and
wheel bearings.
Leaving Windsor and heading towards
Richmond, a test of maximum speed is
made over a perfectly level stretch of
concrete roadway. Here over a surveyed
mile the time taken from a flying start
is checked by two stop-watches.
Incidentally, speedometer readings at
high maximum speeds seldom correspond
with results of timing, so that motorists
must not always rely on figures shown
on the dial during high-speed bursts.
Passing through Richmond, the road
rapidly becomes steeper and rougher, and
a turn off through Grose Vale over an
unmetalled, red-clay roadway provides a
splendid test of road holding and steer-
ing, particularly in wet \Veather.
A little further and the steep climb of
Kurrajong Mountain begins, the actual
timed section being over a distance of
two miles, and including some particu-
larly rough going over the final quarter-
mile, which, by the way, is an extremely
steep and difficult section under ideal
conditions.
During the speed section of the hill
climb one is able to determine the car’s
behavior when driven fast on corners,
and, in addition, the suspension system
is submitted to a decidedly severe test.
Descending the hill again, the emer-
gency braking equipment is tested, and
returning to Richmond the cross-country
route via Castlereagh is taken, joining up
with the main Western Highway at Pen-
rith. On this section the slow-running
and acceleration tests —the most critical
of the series—are carried out.
Two sections, each 350 yards, are
measured, and the car is clocked over the
first as slowly as possible in top gear;
“THE BULLETIN” COURSE. —A strenuous test for new cars.
then, without pause, the accelerator pedal
is pushed down, the car gathers speed
and the acceleration section is timed.
In this dual test, involving as it does a
rapid pick-up from slow top-gear pulling,
one can readily determine the traffic pos-
sibilities of any particular car, for, other
things being equal, the more rapid the
acceleration the better the car will be
when driven in top gear through con-
gested traffic.
As a further test of acceleration the
car is slowed down to a steady speed of
10 m.p.h., and times are taken in speeding
up to 30 m.p.h., first in top and after-
wards in intermediate gears. A final
test from a standing start to 50 m.p.h.
through all gears is accurately timed.
The return journey to Sydney is then
begun, passing Penrith, St. Mary’s and
Parramatta, with an additional 15 miles
of heavy traffic to negotiate before con-
cluding the run.
On reaching headquarters the time
taken for the complete journey is noted
and average speed computed, while fuel
consumed is carefully measured.
Over certain sections of the route the
wheel is taken by the observer in order
to faithfully record his impressions upon
steering and general roadworthiness. In
registering the data secured over the com-
plete test, brief mention will be made of
such mechanical features as may be of
interest to motorists.
“Roller”: The fluid flywheel, first
introduced by Daimler and now included
in several leading makes of British cars,
is to be applied to motor-cycles.
The B.S.A. Co. recently showed some
machines at Olympia embodying this
principle, and it is to be a standard fit-
ting in its 1935 machines, with the
Wilson pre-selective gearbox in addition.
This means that stalling of the engine—
always a bugbear to the riders of puffing
billies—is an impossi-
bility, and also that
a rider can previously
select the gear into
which he is likely to
be obliged to change
and, when the time
comes, has just to
depress the pedal to
get the required ratio.

Tyre Pressures and Economy.
During the last few years the trend
of fashion in tyre equipment has slowly
evolved from the narrow high-pressure
beaded edge type through balloons to
air-wheels. Along with this change
there has been a phenomenal increase
in both reliability and mileage.
The modern motorist who disregards
tyre pressures does not take full advan-
tage of these additional benefits. Many
keep on driving so long as the equipment
is not actually flat and, although the
fact that it can carry on at all under
such conditions is to the credit of the
large section tyre, serious risks are in-
volved and the maintenance bill is defi-
nitely increased. Proper inflation is im-
portant, and even more so is the
keeping up of an equal pressure
in each casing.
There are few drivers who
have to take much trouble to
get to a free-air station, and the
remedy is as easy as it is obvious.
Under-inflation results in un-
due flexing of the cover walls,
generates undue heat and defi-
nitely shortens tyre life ; while
in rounding corners at speed,
especially on loose roadways,
the car is almost certain to slide
about in an alarming manner
and it requires very skilful
handling to avoid serious consequences.
Over-inflation is, of course, equally un-
desirable, for with tyres “board” hard
road shocks are transmitted directly to
chassis and bodywork.
Furthermore, hard tyres will cause a
car to “dither” over bumpy roads and
at high speed may easily provoke a
broadside skid. In the process of bounc-
ing even contact with the roadway is
“What's that you say? Mr. Mugdriver’s here now. Got the fellow that pinched
his car, have you? Good!"
“For the Lord’s sake tell ’em not to let him go till he explains how he got it
started!"
lost, wheels begin to spin and so tyres
suffer from continuous shock and
friction.
The shrewd motorist will therefore
purchase a reliable tyre gauge and at
definite intervals carefully check pres-
sures in all equipment, including spares,
and make sure they comply exactly with
those recommended by the makers.
The Trouble Lamp.
R.A. (Port Kernbla): Check up ball races
in back axle and differential assembly....
H.V.W. (Tenterfield): Oil you are at present
using is suitable for transmission... .J.G. (Vau-
cluse): Piston and con. rod can be withdrawn
by removing sump G.M.D. (Coogee):
Have brake-drums turned up true and dress
linings with suitable fluid... .T.J. (Narcm-
burn): Oil pressure trouble not serious; carry
on....T.D. (Cobden, Vic.): Ignition probably
in order; look for leaks in induction system.
W.B. (Waverley): False economy to use
sump oil again after that distance. Run it out
and fill afresh.
“Jeviel”: “Torsion” is conventionally
sceptical at the idea of aircraft speed
reaching 600 m.p.h. in the stratosphere
—“almost a vacuum” (B. 30/5/’34). But
the stratosphere is far from being a
vacuum or Picard’s balloon would never
have carried him into it; in a vacuum no
gasbag could laugh at gravity. The
thinner the air the faster a ’plane must
travel to keep aloft; hence, with air
speeds of well over 400 m.p.h. at sea-
level on record, 600 m.p.h. is not unrea-
sonable to expect at 80,000 ft. or there-
abouts. The normal ’plane is designed
for maximum efficiency at a certain
working altitude ; above this its engine,
propeller, wings and control surfaces
gradually lose efficiency. To produce a
machine capable of reaching its peak
performance in the stratosphere designers
are concentrating on thick, high-lift
wings of variable lifting area, propellers
of large or adjustable pitch and super-
charged engines. As for the crews, air-
tight, oxygen-supplied compartments and
electrically heated clothing should keep
them in good shape.

Constipation, ind i g e stion,

Self-poisoning ( Autoxima ).
NEARLY EVERYONE SUFFERS
Self-poisoning is caused through
incomplete evacuation of the
bowels. Nearly everyone suffers,
even people of regular habits.
Modern foods and lack of exercise
give rise to flabbiness of the ab-
dominal organs which makes com-
plete elimination almost impos-
sible. Fragments of food waste
cling to the intestinal walls and
there decay, breeding germs and
poisons which enter the blood-
stream. Self-poisoning is all the
more to be dreaded because it is
hidden and often unsuspected'. The
symptoms of self-poisoning are
always apparent, however. Skin
blemishes, those frequent head-
aches, fits of ‘blues/ the strange
lassitude and weakness which pre-
vent you from entering fully into
the enjoyment of life all point to
you being a victim.

“EQUAL TO 15 YEARS OF LIFE*’
“I have been using COLOSEPTIC
for over three years. I have felt
very grateful to it as it effected a
wonderful difference in health and
strength, equal to a recovery of 15
years of life. I became absolutely
free of any physical complaint

COLOSEPTIC BRINGS BACK
HEALTH
Before you can regain the spark-
ling health that is your birthright,
you must sweep away the poison-
ous intestinal accumulations. Drink
COLOSEPTIC in hot water every
morning. Coloseptic first loosens
the fermenting matter encrusted on
the walls of the intestines and then
gently sweeps it right out of the
body. COLOSEPTIC activates the
kidneys, the pores of the skin, and
the respiratory apparatus, thereby
ridding the blood-stream of all
impurities.
DRINK COLOSEPTIC EVERY
MORNING
COLOSEPTIC gives you the in-
ternal cleansing which is the first
step to perfect health. And with
the body internally clean how well
you feel. Gone are the aches and
pains, the feeling of being old be-
fore your time. You regain the
vim and vigour of youth, your step
is firm, eyes sparkle, you are a new
being alive to all the pleasures
that life can offer.

THE “WIDE-WORLD THREE.”
In January of this year some experi-
mental work was done with an advanced
form of short-wave receiver. Use was made
of an R.F. pentode valve of the 77 type
as electron-coupled detector and a single
stage of impedance coupled audio using
a type 37. The result of this work was
a receiver which featured a degree of
stability and sensitivity in a regenera-
tive detector far ahead of the average
home constructional effort. The name
chosen for this greatly improved type
was “Wide-World Two.” It was battery-

receiver was much in evidence, and

in all such cases was by means of head-
phones, the receiver being designed as
such, and in a number of instances the
desire was expressed for a similar receiver,
but with provision for loudspeaker
operation.
There is no fundamental objection to
the addition of quite a comprehensive
audio system to this receiver, but, when
the listener who lives away in the coun-
try where electrical mains are not avail-
able is to be considered, the battery pro-
blem can become formidable. This is
mainly for the reason that the valves
used are of the “automotive” series, and
require either D.C. or A.C. on the heater
with a flexibility between five and eight
volts, and consume in this requirement
.3, and in some cases .4 or .7, of an
ampere for one valve.
For two valves using .3 ampere at six
volts, the consumption is not so serious
at a little over half an ampere ; but, if
this is increased to approximately two
amperes, then the A battery alone be-
comes a heavy item. By correct design
and application, the B battery consump-
tion can be kept within reasonable limits,
and so it was decided to apply some
suitable method of electron-coupling a
two-volt screen-grid directly-heated de-
tector which, if successful, would per-
mit the use of two-volt valves throughout.
Ho w successful
this is is reflected in
the sterling perfor-
mance from the new
receiver here de-
scribed as the
“W ide - World
Three.” It is fitting
that it should appear
at a time when the
cricket Test matches
for 1934 are a fore-
most topic, for this
receiver is genuinely
“all-wave.” It is de-
signed to cover (by
switching) the broad-
cast band from 200
to 500 metres : and
the useful short-
wave channels be-
tween 18 and 90
metres ; and is a far
more stable form of
regenerative receiver
than the usual kind
using the conven-
tional “feed-back” detector.
In the circuit there are three valves,
these being, in order, Mullard PMI2A,
PM2A (or 2DX) and PM2B. Thus there
are a screen-grid detector, a triode driver
and a double triode Class-B audio valve
(two valves in one). There is available
enough experience with Class-B audio
systems to rule out any possibility of
undesirable features here. Briefly, Class
B for battery receivers is here to stay,
and to-day the laboratory product in-
variably makes use of this excellent
system.
The heart of the “Wide-World
Three” is essentially the detector and
the method in which it is used. A
directly-heated battery valve is put to
work as an electron-coupled detector, and
consultation of the circuit diagram shows
how this is done. As with the cathode-
type valve, resistance control of regenera-
tion is used, there being practically no
frequency shift when this important con-
trol is operated in an electron-coupled
circuit. As the valve is directly heated,
it is necessary to keep the filament above
earth R.F. potential, and so a filament
choke becomes essential. This choke is
by no means the usual R.F. choke with
which the reader may be familiar for
general use in plate and plate supply cir-
cuits. It plays a very important part in the
operation of the detector, and is made as
follows.
There are four banks of 30-gauge
D.S.C. copper-wire wound on a fin.
dowel 4in. long. Each bank is made by
winding on 10 turns for the bottom
layer, nine for the next and eight for
the top, and between each banked wind-
ing there is a space of fin. This is not
a difficult choke to make. After winding
it is dipped into clear Duco to hold the
turns in position. The filament of the
PMI2A is by-passed by a .005 mfd. con-
denser to ensure that both sides of the
filament are at the same potential above
earth. The tuning condenser is a special
type made by Efco with a split stator.
One section approximates .00015 mfd.
and is thus suitable for short-wave tun-
ing, and, with the switching-in shunt of
the other stator, the total capacity is
.00038 mfd., and provides a correct
coverage for the normal broadcast range.
The illustration of the chassis shows
that a two-gang cpndenser was used. The
explanation is that at the time the receiver
was built a single condenser was not
available, but one will be installed by
the time this appears in print. Switching
over the requisite wave-bands is done
smoothly and with positive contact by a
Lekmek all-wave switch. This has two
sections with four
contacts in each,
and is indicated in
the diagram as
SWI and SW2.
The aerial coup-
ling condenser is a
four-plate midget,
this being used at
minimum capacity
on short waves and
half capacity (or
more) for broad-
cast. The length
and height of the
aerial will have
some effect on the
position of this condenser, and the con-
denser must be adjusted to suit.
Grid-leak detection is employed and
impedance coupling in the plate circuit in
preference to resistance. The choke is a
Lekmek type 53-B, and either this or the
A.W.A. high impedance Ideal choke
must be used if the reader is to dupli-
cate the results with this receiver. A very
important item is the regeneration poten-
tiometer in the screen-grid of the PMI2A.
This is shown as being 50,000 ohms, but
may be anything to 500,000. Smooth
variation of resistance is imperative here,
and so the potentiometer is a Centralab-
Stromberg model. This is shunted as a
precaution by a .5 mfd. condenser from
screen-grid to earth. The rest of the
circuit needs little explanation beyond
the use of the new Airzone Class-B driver
transformer for the PM2B valve, and an
Amplion 01 permag. speaker fitted with
Class-B input transformer. Each side of
the secondary of the driver transformer is
shunted by a 10,000-ohm resistor, and a
tone-leveller is used across the plates of
the PM2B in the form of a .01 mfd. con-
denser and 10,000-ohm resistor. The A
positive, B negative circuit is the metal
chassis, and A negative, which is fed
through the filament choke and tap-to-
filament portion of the coils, is common
with C positive. The full plate voltage
is used on all valves (135 volts), and the
screen-grid of the PMI2A is supplied at
112 y volts (via the potentiometer).
The coils are grouped around the
wave-change switch under the chassis, so
that wiring is as short as possible, and
are wound on Uin. formers. For the
broadcast range LI has 102 turns of 34
enamelled copper wire, with the tap
between SW2 and earth at the third turn.
L 2 and L 3 are both wound on the same
former, L 2 having 22 turns of 28 D.C.C.,
with the tap at \\ turns from earth.
This coil covers from 50 to 90 metres.
L 3, for the range between 28 and 50
Circuit diagram of the "Wide-World Three.”
metres, has eight turns of 28 D.C.C., with
the tap at \\ turns from earth.
L 4 is the smallest coil, and consists
of five turns of 26 D.S.C., with the tap
I! turns from earth. It will be seen
that the filament supply is fed through
this portion of each coil between the tap
and the earth (A positive). When the all-
wave switch is thrown over to the broad-
cast range (LI) the extra condenser stator

section comes into action, this being con-
nected directly to the Contact stud for
the grid end of LI.
The chassis is of metal, aluminium for
preference, and measures 1 14in. x 64in. x
2lin., with valves and controls placed
as illustrated. The wave-change switch
is immediately below the tuning dial, with
the regeneration potentiometer on the
left and the filament switch on the right.
The aerial-coupling condenser is at the
rear left of the chassis, and must be care-
fully insulated therefrom. Any leakage
here, and the whole action of the detector
will be upset by heavy aerial load on the
grid circuit. A two-meg. grid leak and
.0001 mfd. condenser provide the correct
j| id circuit combination.
It is also important that the grid coup-
ling condenser for the PM2A driver
valve should be one with absolutely no
leakage ; therefore a condenser with mica
dielectric is to be preferred to the
paper tubular kind. The PMI2A valve
and the PM2A use a four-pin socket,
PMI2A having the plate-connection to
♦he small terminal on the valve cap.
> M2B uses the standard American six-
pin socket.
The characteristics of the valves used
are as follows:
The PMI2A is a two-volt, directly-
heated screen-grid valve, for use as a
radio-frequency amplifier or speech-
detector, or as a frequency-changer in
superheterodynes. Filament voltage, 2.0 ;
filament current, .18 amps.; plate voltage,
150 ; screen voltage, 90 ; grid bias, 0 ;
average plate current, 2.8 ma.; plate
resistance, 330,000 ohms.
The PM2DX is a two-volt, directly-
heated triode, having a medium im-
pedance and suitable for use as detector,
audio-frequency amplifier and oscillator.
Filament voltage, 2.0; filament current,
.1 amp. ; plate voltage, 150 ; negative grid
bias, 4.5; approximate plate current,
4.oma. ; plate resistance, 12,000 ohms.
The PM2B is a double Class-B power-
output valve, for use in battery-operated
receivers and amplifiers, consisting of
two high-amplification triodes in one
bulb. Filament voltage, 2.0; filament
current, 0.2 amps.; maximum plate
voltage, 150; optimum load impedance
(plate to plate), 14,000 ohms. ; maximum
undistorted power output, 1.25 watts:
minimum input impedance of valve, 3000-
5000 ohms.
The R.C.A. type-19 valve is interchange-
able in this receiver. Headphones may be
used very easily without any alteration.
A six-pin valve socket, with the head-
phone leads connected to the two pins
making contact with the outsides (grids)
of the driver transformer, is simply
plugged in place of the PM2B valve.
This is an ideal arrangement when search-
ing for short-wave stations on the higher-
frequency bands under poor reception
conditions; but, normally, the electron-
coupled detector will pass on quite the
weakest of signals via the Class-B audio
system with ample speaker volume. The
speaker plugs into a valve socket (three
connections used) at the rear of the
chassis.
The “Wide World Three” has the follow-
ing component parts:
Chassis: 11? x 6? x 2\ inches.
Two four-pin valve sockets (detector and
driver).
One six-pin valve socket (Class-B valve).
One five-pin valve socket (speaker plug).
One Efco split stator tuning condenser.

One 0 to 250,000 Centralab-Stromberg poten-
tiometer (regeneration control).
Four coils, broadcast and short-wave ranges
(see text).

(aerial coupling).
One filament switch.
Two .0001 mfd. mica dielectric condensers
(grid and plate of detector).

tion potentiometer).

supply by-pass).
One .005 mfd. by-pass condenser (across detec-
tor filament).
One standard R.F. choke.

Five control knobs.
Two terminals (aerial and earth).
Battery cable, seven leads.
Valves: Detector, Mullard PMI2A; driver,
Mullard PM2A or 2DX; Class B, Mullard

Batteries: Three 45-volt largest capacity type;
one 4|-volt C battery (driver bias).
One two-volt accumulator, Vesta.
Loudspeaker: Amplion type 01 with Class-B

Construction should be done as
soundly as possible, with stiff wiring to
the short-wave coils, and all leads should
be short and direct. There is no more
difficulty in making this receiver than
the usual plug-in coil version, and, with
the sweetly-smooth oscillation control and
the convenience of changing to any wave-
band by a twist of the switch, it is cap-
able of a very fine all-round performance.
Don B. Knock.
How Many Turns?
Many thousands of descriptions of
short-wave receivers for home construc-
tors have appeared in print in this coun-
try and overseas. Although a coil table
is invariably supplied as a guide, this can
only be taken as an approximation. One
receiver will be different from another in
frequency range, owing to unavoidable
stray capacity. Consequently countless
letters reach radio editors asking “How
many turns should 1 use?” Here is a
short-cut solution to the problem. Using
the former on which it is proposed to
wind the coil, wind on rather more turns
of small-gauge rubber-covered wire than
would normally be needed, with the
turns close-wound. Connect the coil in
the grid circuit of your receiver. One
end of coil will connect to the grid side
of the tuning condenser, and the other
end is left disconnected. Connect to the
rotor plates of the tuning condenser a
flex lead with a pin soldered thereto as in
the diagram. This pin may be pushed
through the rubber insulation, and you
may thus try any number of turns until
you find what you require. When the
final coil is made it is not likely to be
more than a turn or two out if you wind
the number of turns found in this way.
Don’t use this temporary coil as a per-
manency, however. Dead-end effects will
be produced by the unwanted odd turns
at the end, and the amount of rubber
insulation will also make the coil in-
efficient for short-waves.
What’s What in Radio.
The Australian radio trade is enjoying
a boom period again. During the
writer’s recent tour of N. S. Wales, when
many country dealers were interviewed
and technical problems discussed, it was
found that in practically every case sales
were on the increase, and the trouble
was to obtain delivery of receivers from
the factories. The reason for this in-
creased volume of business was the Test
matches. In the history of Australian
broadcasting nothing has done more to
stimulate the sale of receivers and add
to the revenue from licenses than the
transference of the cricket ground to the
home per the microphone. Even the
listener with little or no concern origin-
ally in the outcome of the matches de-
velops a growing interest in the struggle.
All over Australia and England, and in
most parts of the Empire, hundreds of
thousands of valves are glowing nightly
and daily as unseen audiences hang on
to every detail of the cricket commen-
tator’s description. In our cities some
people even wear headphones in bed.

telephony was just a teething youngster.
The few experimenters in existence prior to
August, 1914, had their apparatus seized

of the Post Office. To be in possession
of a crystal detector or a single head-

flict should tell a different story. The
business of locating hundreds of thou-
sands of short-wave receivers (to say no-
thing of transmitters) should present even
a Hitler with an impossible task. Broad-
casting stations throughout the world,
particularly the short-wave ones, will be-
come sowers of war propaganda.

P. P. Eckersley, the father of Euro-
pean broadcasting and “regional”
schemes, is quoted by a section of the
Sydney press as having submitted to
the British Government a proposal for
a “wired-wireless” system of broadcast-
ing, whereby a loudspeaker is plugged
into a light or power socket and a selec-
tion of programmes superimposed on
the 240-volt mains is taken by turning
a knob. This is old news rehashed.
Eckersley has had the scheme well
developed for many years. During a
conversation with
the writer in Syd-
ney in 1931, he
termed it “Radio-
Rediffusion.” But
it is more than a
matter of plugging
a lou d s p eaker.
Without suitable
precautions and
equipment, things
would undoubtedly
happen to fuses
and loudspeakers.
Television is
making strides.
N e w s p apermen
were invited to
Film House,
Wardour-street, London, to witness the
reception of a television programme
transmitted by the Baird system from the
Crystal Palace—sound films, a manne-
quin parade, conjuring and a violin solo.
A prominent technician appeared on the
screen and delivered an explanation of
the new system. The demonstration
proved that television is now possible in
a more practical and satisfactory form
than has been the case for many years.
The definition was rsported to be per-
fect, and the pictures were quite steady
and brilliant and of real entertainment
value.
As an instance of the progress tele-
vision is making in England, a Bradford
“visionist” has made photographic
exposures of 8.8. C. television broadcasts.
A remarkable feat, for during the three-
second exposures the images on the tele-
visor had to be built up of 37 pictures.

Radio has been indirectly responsible
for remarkable development in the
science of electronics. The perfection
of the sound film is the result of
advancement in audio amplification.
With the sound film came the modern
photo-cell or “electric eye,” and the
applications of this useful accessory are
innumerable. The American Founda-
tion for the Blind has been conducting
experiments with photo-cell guides, en-
abling blind persons to follow light
beams down halls and across corridors.
The photo-cell operates a buzzer as long
as the “electric eye” is in the lighted
safety zone. Another interesting radio
development for the blind is the “talking
book” —in effect, a combined radio re-
ceiver and amplifier phonograph. This
reproduces standard literary works in
long records. The device is to be dis-
tributed through the Braille libraries.

There is not much variety in broad-
cast receivers in Germany. Under the
Hitler Government, a special “suit-every-
pocket” receiver is made by the trade.
Dealers must be content with very little
profit for their efforts.
German radio engineers have developed
a new form of interference locator for
tracking down courses of disturbances
caused by “man-made static.” It is
stated that with this new system inter-
ference sources can be found within 15
to 20 minutes, even in densely popu-
lated districts. There are many country
towns in Australia where broadcast lis-
teners would welcome the application of
such a development, the interference
being of such an aggressive nature in
some cases that demonstration of re-
ceivers by dealers is out of the question
without going some distance out of the
town.
The Q. and A. Column.
To secure free service, merely attach the
coupon from the inside back cover of The
Bulletin.
Subjects of general interest arising from sub-
scribers’ problems will be dealt with in reason-
able detail, and circuit diagrams will be pub-
lished where possible.
Every inquiry must be confined to one
subject.
Will the battery short-wave single-valve con-
verter described in “Australian Radio News,”
14/7/’33, be suitable for a five-valve T.R.F.
battery receiver ? An Osram screen-grid valve
is available, and I would like to use this if
possible. Is the aerial condenser essential ? —10.
The valve will be suitable provided it is of
the same filament voltage rating as the valves
in the set, otherwise a series resistance may be
required to drop the voltage. The plate should
have 135 volts and the screen 80 volts, the
circuit remaining fundamentally the same as
for the triode valve. The aerial condenser is
necessary, as it removes the aerial load from
the grid circuit and permits even oscillation
over the required frequency range. Quite a
small capacity can be used here, and one of
the old-fashioned neutralising condensers is
useful for this purpose.
In what, issue of “Australian Radio News”
was the “Wide-World Two” short-wave re-
ceiver described, and what are the outstanding
features ? —9.
In the issue of 26/1 /’34. Valves are cither
a 77 and 37 in the 6.3 volt indirectly-heated
series or 57 and 56 in the 2.5 standard A.C.
indirectly-heated range. The special feature
is that the detector is used “electron-coupled”
and thus extreme stability at high frequencies
is obtained together with good audio gain.
Plug-in coils were used with a high L/C ratio
and provision for band-spreading was made.
The band-spread series condenser may be
switched out of circuit for ordinary short-
wave broadcast tuning, and is used only to
place the amateur 14mc., 7mc. and 3.5mc.
bands on a 0 to 100 degree dial spread. Actu-
ally this feature is not essential for the general
listener, but is invaluable for the amateur
transmitter. The circuit diagram is illustrated
here. If the valves are heated from an accu-
mulator, the centre-tapped heater resistor
should be omitted and B negative connected
direct to A negative.
I have noticed several references to electron-
coupled oscillators in radio publications and
cannot see from diagrams where these differ
from the usual oscillator. What is meant by
electron-coupling ? —ll.
In the case of an oscillator, electron-coupling
refers to the method in which the loading cir-
cuit is coupled. An oscillator so used has
the advantage that reaction of the loading
circuit is minimised, with the result that the
oscillator is practically independent of changes
which would otherwise affect the frequency
of oscillation.
Is there any possibility that the moulded
base of a valve will affect the operation of
such a valve as, an oscillator for short-waves ?
—l2.
Depends mostly to-day upon the frequen-
cies required. A valve with a “moulded mud”
base could be troublesome at 56mc. (five
metres), but for the usual short-wave work be-
tween 12 and 200 metres the trouble would
not be in evidence, all other constants in the
receiver being correct. In the early days of
short-wave reception, amateurs removed the
bases and mounted the bulb of the valve on
sponge rubber; but valves have improved very
considerably since then.
Method of working out the time an accu-
mulator (A battery ) will last for each charge ?
—l5.
Accumulators are rated at a number of
“actual” ampere-hours. By “actual” is indi-
cated the difference from the old term
“ignition,” the latter being a relic of early
motoring days. “Actual” capacity is approxi-
mately half “ignition” capacity. If the
“actual” ampere-hour capacity of an accu-
mulator is 30, and four valves are used in the
receiver, with a total filament consumption of
.5 ampere, dividing .5 into 30 gives for its
answer 60, this being the number of hours the
accumulator will last. One ampere-hour is
equal to one ampere flowing for a period of
one hour, 2 amperes for 30 minutes, half an
ampere for two hours, etc. It is essential, of
course, that the accumulator cells should be
in first-class condition.
I made up a universal meter from a 0-1 mil-
liamperemeter according to a description in a
technical journal. Voltages read correctly, but
the milliampere readings are not according to
stated values. What’s wrong? —3.
The trouble is most likely one of calibration
of the shunts required for the various current
ranges. This must be done accurately, and the
meter checked against standard meters to en-
sure correct calibration. On the other hand, if
you are using switching for the various ranges,
you may have incorrect wiring to the switch
mechanism.
I am puzzled over a circuit diagram of a
reflex superhet. which appeared in “Australian
Radio News,” 17/11/’33. The circuit shows
the 281 duo-diode-peptode as having only one
diode plate. Is this correct, and is the receiver
as described efficient ? —5.
Your difficulty arises out of the way in
which the valve was illustrated. Actually the
two diode plates are connected together and
the symbol for one plate is correct. This un-
conventional receiver is capable of an excellent
performance, and is no more tricky to put into
operation than the usual straight super-
heterodyne.

in great style, carrying lOst. 111 b., or
41b. more than he will have at Flem-
ington. Former Sydney jockey L. J.
Hynes rode Our Comet cleverly, slowing
down the field when in front and con-
serving the energy of his mount for a
burst of speed in the last half-mjle.
Ortalan knocked up in a desperate effort
to overtake the leader, and Prime Seal
beat him for second by a neck. If he
had not stifled a hurdle badly Prime Seal
would have done better, but if Our
Comet can see out three miles in the
National he should again account for
those that finished behind him. D. J.
Price has built him up, but doubt con-
cerning the stamina of the chestnut per-
sists.
Prime Seal belongs to Mrs. P. Grant
Hay, whose husband grows hops in Tas-
mania and brews beer in Richmond.
Mrs. Hay also has Oldhome engaged in
the G.N. Hurdle. Both geldings are by
Sarchedon, whom Prime Seal favors in
color. Public form suggests that Old-
home possesses a better chance than his
stable-mate at Flemington. He romped

in for the Jumpers’ Flat at Mentone on
Wednesday, and repeated the feat in a
similar event at the Valley with a 71b.
penalty. Oldhome relished the journey
of If miles, and the National distance
should not trouble him. His dam, Mill-
stream, is by King Offa from Water-
shoot, a Maoriland-bred mare that pro-
duced Percolator to Comedy King when
in Sol Green’s Shipley stud.
After he captured the G.N. Hurdle of
1933 so brilliantly, Belar had an outing
on the flat at Moonee Valley. Injured
while schooling in preparation for the
Australian Hurdle, he was put aside and
did not again sport silk until he com-
peted in the Tozer Welter at the Warr-
nambool Cup meeting last month. The
Poitrel gelding was saddled up for the
Greenvale Welter at Moonee Valley
merely for the purpose of a public gallop.
He started at 50 to 1 and ran accordingly.
Belar will have had a comparatively short
National preparation. On the other hand,
his rival Baanya is shaping well on the
flat in fair company. With 9st. up
Baanya was made a 3-to-l favorite for
the Deep Creek Handicap, and earned
praise by running third after receiving
a bump early and being second-last at
the back of the course. Barren Corn
(12 to 1) led throughout, and scored easily
from Akanree.
Until lately Akanree was raced by
J. L. Byrne, a wealthy Englishman who
lives in the Mornington district and is
fond of hunting. W. Burke now has
Akanree. He went close to landing a
double, Royal Barb having annexed the
Chandos Handicap sprint. Royal Barb
is a brother to The Dimmer. G. L. Scott
expected to win a Caulfield Cup
with Royal Barb, but the nag let him
down season after season, and recently
Scott sold him to Burke. Courage en-
abled Royal Barb to squeeze home on
Saturday by half a head from Belle
Marie, with Porcia a head farther off.
Belle Marie is a model of consistency,
and with ordinary luck she could not
have lost.
The Travancore Steeplechase, in which
the places were filled by Greendon, King
of Arms and Philax, threw no light on
the cross-country G.N. except to dis-
count the chance of Wirrate to zero.
Hynes could not persuade Wirrate to
stretch out or jump at all satisfactorily,
and punters who took 5 to 2 about the
Great Star gelding had the mortification
of seeing him whip-in the field. Hynes
has declined to ride Wirrate in the
National. His services will probably be
secured for Redditch ; it is thought that
Redditch will go better for Hynes than
he has done for Inkson in recent outings.

When the late Frank Marsden bought
Hot Shot for 120 guineas he was in-
fluenced by the breeding of the yearling—
by Pantheon out of a Rossendale mare,
Rosewyn. It is no wonder that Hot Shot,
who carries the colors of Miss Ena Mars-
den, can stay. Starting at 4 to 1 for the
Canterbury Handicap Hot Shot made the
opposition look like a tired mob of army
mules. He had to give Polette a big
start from the three furlongs, but re-
sponded gamely when Lightfoot drew the
whip, and went on to score from Mayon-
naise and Polette. He will now be kept
for the long-distance events of the spring.
Rogerson led to the half-mile, but
dropped back immediately he was tackled
by Polette. Juliet Glass was another
disappointment, but old Blairfoot,
although he ran last, is beginning to look
himself again.
Admirably ridden by McCarten, Cane-
grass (7 to 2), who is held on lease by
Jack King from the Warren pastoralist
G. Falkiner, took the Flying Handicap
from Rona Valley and Narbethong.
McCarten sent Canegrass along with the
favorite, Le Touquet, for two furlongs
and permitted Workman the job of run-
ring down the pacemaker. Workman
shifted out; McCarten dashed Canegrass
between the pair and had the race won
in a twinkling.
Bathurst sportsman W. H. Kennerson,
who has done well with Some Boy and
Brazenface, is finding Povertdale a bar-
gain. His victory in the Juvenile, after
having to overcome difficulties —he was
forced wide at the turn —stamps him out
of the ordinary. He cost 100 guineas, and
is by Rossendale from Duchess Poverty,
by Duke Foote. Alftruda, the favorite,
had to be bustled in the early stages, and
after leading with The Black Cat could
only run third, Blueville beating her for
second prize.
Jockey Knowles, who won the A.J.C.
Hurdle on Mount Dangar, showed his
versatility by scoring on Chatterelle (5 to
1) in the Ashbury Handicap. The Wind-
bag mare, who is related to Sackbut,
galloped easily behind Leone, and gave
her the go-by at the Leger; Verlina was
a poor third. Dilemma started favorite
and ran last.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Camera has lost his world’s heavy-
weight championship. Last week he met
Max Baer at New York and was so fear-
fully belted that the referee stopped the
mill in the eleventh round and gave it to
Baer on a “technical” knock-out. The
winner weighed 15st. to Camera’s 18st.
111 b. The betting, which earlier in the
day was 6 to 5 on the Italian, swapped
round until Baer went into the ring at
7 to 5 on.

Even people who go to the wrestling
like to see how matches are won or lost,
and hundreds who were at Leichhardt on
Saturday night are still wondering how
Lurich beat Beth. Both seemed too
robust for fast work, but they kept in-
terest alive by slapping one another. At
times slaps sent Lurich to the mat. The
American made his fatter foe squeal a
few times before that worthy surrendered
to a hammerlock in the third. Instead of
getting credit for a fall Beth was dis-
qualified for “kneeing.” Spectators who
hadn’t noticed the offence expressed
their feelings in the usual manner.
Woodfull’s Men
The Gentlemen v. Australia match at
Lord’s saw the wicket in one of its
nastiest moods on the opening day,
the long dry spell having visibly affected
pitch and outfield. The Gentlemen, skip-
pered by Walters, who again took
Wyatt’s place, made a poor showing at
the start, losing 6 wickets for 72 and 8
for 124. Lowndes, who scored a cen-
tury against the tourists for Hampshire,
reached 44 after a scratchy beginning,
and was helped by Brown, here with
Jardine (31), and Clay, a bowler from
Glamorgan, who made 30. All were out
for 177. Cheering, in view of the Test
this week, was the success of Wall, who
usually does well at Lord’s. He took 3
good wickets for 49. Ebeling had 2 for
39, and the inevitable Grimmett 4 for 76.
Australia did little better when its
turn came. Woodfull, Brown and Mc-
Cabe went for 64, but Darling (42),
Kippax (33) and Bromley (30) brought
the score to 6 for 164 at stumps.
Read, of Essex, much advertised as a new
fast bowler, took 1 for 41 unimpressively.
Holmes, Robins and Brown divided the
other wickets.

Larwood has whirled himself out of
big cricket by publishing a tirade against
the Australians and the M.C,C. and
announcing that on no account will he
appear against a team whose captain said
in Australia: “There are two teams play-
ing and one isn’t playing cricket.” He
has one just cause for complaint. The
M.C.C., which backed the tactics of him-
self and Jardine in Australia, has flag-
rantly deserted the pair of them in Eng-
land. For the rest, the outburst i$ only
what can be expected from a lad lifted
from the coal-pits by sudden athletic
fame and given alternate slobbering
adulation and abuse by the yellow press
of the Empire. Australians, nevertheless,
will regret his fit of temper. They would
have preferred to meet England at its best
and to give Larwood his third chance to
prove that he is anything remotely like
the bowler against Australian batting
in England that he has twice proved
himself in Australia.

Biggest Australian Rules match on
Saturday was at Adelaide, where South
Australia beat Victoria in the 59th game
between the two States. A 35,000 crowd
enjoyed glorious weather and thrilling
play. Equal in height and weight and
a trifle faster, the locals held the visitors
from the start, and in dazzling bursts
in the second quarter, backed by accurate
kicking, gained a lead that the Vies.,
though they tried hard, could never over-
haul. Pratt, South Melbourne’s star for-
ward, was pegged down by Fisher, and
the other forwards lacked co-operation.
Main credit for the victory belongs to
Pontifex, the S.A. captain, who really led
his side and forced a win by superlative
play. After him Parry, Burton and
Johnston shone, while Victoria’s best
were A. Collier, Bunton and Shea. Pratt
got four goals and Forbes five for the
losers; Pontifex five and Farmer seven
for the conquerors. S. Aus., 21 goals
15 behinds (141); Vic., 18 goals 22
behinds (130).

On the M. C. Ground 30,000 barrackers
were amused by a scuffle between the
League and Association, which was first
intended as a charity match. Both parties
later protested that charity began at
home. The thing was interesting, though
it lacked the vim of club games, but
there was always the impression that the
League 18 wasn’t doing its darnedest.
So few were surprised when in the last
quarter the League put on pressure and
ran away, to win by 33 points—l 43 to
110. Brightest star on the ground was
Rudolph, formerly of Richmond ; after
him Sheahan and Seymour did most for
the Association. The Leaguers were much
of a muchness, though possibly Cordner,
of Hawthorn, and Strang, of Richmond,
did a little extra.

The Sydney Rugby Union matches on
Saturday further confused the final issue
of the premiership, only six points now
separating the seven leading clubs. Manly
showed . a return to form by downing
University decisively by 15-5, five tries
to a converted try. Uni.’s inside backs
were ineffectual. Parramatta gave the
conquering Randwickers a scare at
Coogee, leading the Greens 3-0 at half-
time. With the wind behind, the home side
warmed up in the second half, and with
Richards getting a good share of the ball
their backs were soon working smoothly.
Randwick won 14-6, scoring three tries,
one converted, and a p.g. to two p.gs.
With Cowper back to form, Northern
Suburbs beat Drummoyne 18-8 (three
tries, all converted by Cowper, who
added a p.g., to two tries, one converted).
Western Suburbs won a bad game from
St. George at Concord by 11-6, and
Eastern took the bye against Navy and
prevailed by 16-8.
=K * * *
Rugby League games saw Western
Suburbs score seven tries and eight goals
to a converted try and a p.g. by North
Sydney. Western won by 37-7, and now
heads the poll with 14 points, Eastern
Suburbs running second with 10. At
Drummoyne, South Sydney Won easily
from Balmain by 28-8, though at half-
time the Balmainers led 8-7. The
Southern side galloped over the opposi-
tion in the second half with the wind
against them. Eastern Suburbs defeated
Newtown 23-9. At Earl Park, St. George
beat University 23-5 in a very rough
game, which at times got out of the
referee’s control.

Australian tennis followers got a shock
on Sunday morning when they read that
Crawford had been beaten by Merlin
4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 in the Davis Cup singles
at Paris. McGrath came to the rescud
by downing Boussus by three sets to two,
and Crawford and Quist improved the
outlook by licking Borotra and Brug-
non 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 4-6, 6-3. In the
other semi-final between the Czechs and
Italy, the former were ahead by a singles
and doubles match to a singles. In the
women’s Wightman Cup battle at Wim-
bledon, America defeated England for
the eighth time in the series. England
won one singles and one doubles match.

Woodfull’s Men
Australia won the first Test of the
tour—the 130th of the series—at Not-
tingham by 238 runs in a match full of
changing fortunes which ended with the
thrilling dispatch of the English tail-
enders ten minutes before time. Our men
had a bit the best of the luck, but they
backed it with determined cricket. Win-
ning the toss gave Woodfull a good start,
and the wearing of the wicket as the
game progressed was against England,
which had to face a big fourth-innings
score in the closing stages. At the same
time the pitch was probably not as bad as
it was made out to be, for the leading
Australian batsmen, several of them
forcing the game to save time, did not
seem to be troubled by it in the second
innings.
. Outstanding features of the match
were the untiring and deadly bowling of
O’Reilly and Grimmett; the perform-
ance of the Essex amateur Fames, who
took 10 for 179—a splendid Test debut
for a fast bowler ; the batting of McCabe
and Chipperfield and the slip-fielding of
the Newcastle man. Grimmett and
O’Reilly were without serious support,
an aspect of the match which sounds
an ominous note for future Tests.
It is absurd to hope that the two spin
bowlers will be always as successful, and
though Wall is a gallant worker he has
not yet shown his old form in England.
The inclusion of a bowler like Oxenham
in place of players like Fleetwood-Smith
and Ebeling would have made matters
look rosier for Australia.
Turning to the scorebook, England
answered Australia’s first innings of 374
with 268. Hendren played a plucky
knock for 79, and was helped out with
a wild and fluky 53 from Geary, one of
Chapman’s best bowlers in Australia in
1928-29. Grimmett’s whack of the bag
was 5 for 81, and O’Reilly’s 4 for 75.
Wall got Pataudi, though 82 runs were
knocked off him. Woodfull and Pons-
ford both went cheaply in the second
innings, and Bradman reached 25 only.
Brown, in first wicket down, batted
too slowly for the situation, though he
kept his wicket up while McCabe
lathered the bowling for 88. Brown went
for 73, and Darling, Chipperfield and
O’Reilly had a lash until Woodfull
closed, rather belatedly, with 8 down for
273.
Walters (46) and Sutcliffe (24) opened
encouragingly for England, and when
Chipperfield accepted another slip catch
from the Yorkshireman 51 was on the
board. Then Grimmett and O’Reilly,
helped by a worn patch or two, made a
procession of the opposition, in spite of
desperate stonewalling. All the same,
there was a dashed narrow margin to
spare when O’Reilly got Mitchell and
ended a great game. In this instance,
Grimmett had to be content with 3 for
39, while O’Reilly, wisely returning to
his slower deliveries, showed his best
Australian form to take 7 for 54.
The Australians drew the twelfth
match of their tour, Northampton man-
aging to play out time with a wicket in
hand. By arrangement, stumps were
drawn at 5 p.m., a practice which seems
to have become general when minor
counties are met, and one that reduces
the game to a farce.
Australia, led by Bradman, who was
suffering from lameness, batted first and
reached 284, its smallest total to date.
Ponsford (56), Brown (30), Bradman
(65) and Chipperfield (71) scored most
of the runs, Kippax, Darling and Brom-
ley again failing. Matthews, a profes-
sional, took 4 for 71. Northampton’s first
innings of 187 was dominated by Fleet-
wood-Smith, who again struck a patch
of consistency, taking 5 for 63. O’Reilly
and Ebeling shared the other wickets.
The only batsman to handle the bowling
was Snowden, a young amateur of whom
much has been expected for a couple
of seasons. Fie scored 105 of his side’s
total. Australia’s second knock of 234
included 113 by Brown. Save for Brad-
man (25) and Barnett, who hit blithely
for 44, the others did little. Matthews,
with 5 for 87, was again the villain of
the piece. The county had an exciting
race with the clock, but was saved by a
good stand by Bakewell (53) and Timms
(50), none of the others getting double
figures. At stumps nine of the side
were gone for 133. Once more Fleet-
wood-Smith came to light, this time with
5 for 29.
* * * *
“Mat”: The first Test match upset the
record book for games played at Not-
tingham. O’Reilly’s 11 wickets for 129
supplants Grimmett’s 10 for 201 in 1930,
while Farnes’s 10 for 179 is the first
double-figure match effort by an English
bowler. O’Reilly’s 7 for 54 is also a
shade better than Frank Laver’s 7 for
64 in 1905. Woodfull and Ponsford's 76
for the first wicket wipes out Joe Darling
and Reg Duff’s 62 for Australia, put up
in 1905 ; and Australia’s 374 obliterates
the highest innings total of 335, which
was to the credit of the 1930 XI.
* :|t * *
“Statist”: Worth noting that the win-
ning of the Test at Trent Bridge again
puts Australia in the lead by a game.
Prior to Chapman’s visit to these shores
in 1928-29, we had a good lead. Chap-
man’s four wins cut that down, and,
“Why the blazes do you keep on looking at that watch?"
“It ain’t a watch — it’s a compass.”
though Woodfull’s 1930 trip added two
more to Australia’s score, a run of four
by Jardine equalised matters. Students
of figures might be intrigued also by the
run of ll’s in the first innings of the
recent game. Darling and O’Reilly
scored 11 between them, and Brown 22.
Bradman’s and Darling’s contributions
came to 33, and Woodfull’s and Brad-
man’s to 55. The first wicket went at
77, and the second at 88. Chipperfield
made 99, and the total was 374.
* * * *
“Bramall Lane ’: Curious that one run
should make all the difference between
just fine achievement and immortality.
Poor Chipperfield, in spite of the great
part he played in winning the first Test
for Australia at Notts, will for ever
regret that he fell short of the three
figures in his first-innings score. Only
15 batsmen have managed to hoist a
century in their first Test match, eight
being Britons and the balance Australians.
The last Australian to turn the trick was
the late Archie Jackson at Adelaide in
1928-29. Pataudi is the last on the British
list, with that queer century on Sydney
Cricket Ground in 1932-33.
* * * *
“Tenth Slip”: Amidst the insistent,
ballyhoo arising from the defeat of Eng-
land at Trent Bridge one theme obliter-
ates everything else. “We must have
Larwood” is the cry, and no doubt when
the final selection for the Lord’s match
is made —it should be published by the
time this appears in print—the Notts lad
will be on the list. It seems to be the
opinion in England that Larwood alone
can obliterate the Australian menace.
If he was bowling, in Australia, as with
Chapman and Jardine, I would say “My
oath” to that. One can only go on form,
though, and in his two encounters in
England with Australian sides Larwood
has been an emphatic dud. In the 1926
Tests Larwood got 9 wickets for 28 runs
apiece. Playing for Notts against the
visitors that year he took 3 for 88. In
1930, after winning the Tests for Chap-
man in Australia, he took 4 wickets
in Tests at a cost of 74 runs apiece.
For Notts his tally was 3 for 85. The
task of the cricket prophet is a thorny
one, but, after all, he cannot ignore the
figures.

“Fitzcray”: A curious obsession of the
Victorian Football League, that each of
its senior clubs shall have at least one
player in every inter-State team, caused
a bit of a tangle prior to the match with
South Australia at Adelaide. Nineteen
men were sent over, and the final selec-
tion caused some heartburnings, especi-
ally as capacity to play football had to
be disregarded. The V.F.L. is the only
games organisation writer has heard of
which follows this practice. With all the
others it is a question of picking those
whom the selectors consider the best men
in their positions, regardless of club
membership.
* * * *
“Hotham”: Yet another job seems
likely to be pushed on to the unhappy
Duke of Gloucester during Melbourne’s
centenary whoopee. A lordly golden cup
has been ordered for the club winning
the Victorian F.L. premiership, and the
Dook is down to present it. In addition
to that, he will have to watch the match,
and what a man reared on Rugby, and
perhaps a little Soccer, will make of the
national game is not easy to forecast.
H.R.H. will, of course, have to eat his
way through the customary feed in addi-
tion, and listen to speeches by football
officials —in the writer’s opinion, the most
fatuous orators in captivity, no matter
what code they represent.
* * * *
“Old Q.”: The coming clash of the
All-Blacks and Australia at Sydney in
August already has all the old-stagers of
Rugby pricking their ears and snuffing
the battle from afar, like the warhorses
in Holy Writ. In recent clashes in
Australia the form between the two has
been fairly level. In 1929 Maoriland
suffered her worst disaster since the
Tarawera eruption, Australia winning all
three Tests. In 1932 the All-Blacks re-
covered prestige with two wins to one
loss and thus became the first holders of
the splendid cup presented by Governor-
General Bledisloe. The cup is accom-
panying the M.L. players to Sydney, and
if they can get away with it again it
won’t be without having to play for it.
Since the series began in 1903, the All-
Blacks have won 14 and Australia 6;
one match has been drawn.
* * * *
“Tenakoe”: The Maorilanders intend
to make a welter of this year’s All-Black
tour of N.S.W. and Queensland —they
are not going to Victoria, unfortunately.
The shipping companies are advertising
a special tour for the occasion, and
already a tremendous amount of printed
publicity matter is flying about. The
visitors will only show once in the coun-
try, meeting Orange (N.S.W.) on August
1 in the first match of the tour. Billy
Wallace, of the “original” All-Blacks, is
being tipped as manager of the team in
view of the good job he did in a similar
billet when M.L. last toured Britain.
“Canny Lad”: The people running
professional Rugby in the North of
England are as hard as their native
whinstone, as Australian Leaguers have
long realised. Hoping against hope, an
Australian delegate attended the annual
meeting of the English League, but the
lads from Wigan and Bradford refused
to hear him after his opening address.
This tactlessly suggested that as the Eng-
lish body had promised not to poach
players from the French R.L. (already
dead in its little cradle) it might con-
sider honoring its many promises to the
same effect to Australia. Followed
alarums and excursions, and the speaker
was ruled out of order.

“Gate”: Following the example of the
Rugby Union this season, the N.S.W.
Rugby League proposes to form another
grade team for .next season. A chunk
of territory in the Canterbury-Bankstown
area which is already thickly populated
by youthful Leaguers and their sup-
porters is to be carved out. One point
in the idea’s favor is that, with nine teams
playing, one will have a bye every week.
The Union has found this a great success,
the disengaged team being able to visit
country football centres which hardly
ever see anything of metropolitan form.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Coolangatta”: On his way back
from Queensland to Sydney after clean-
ing up the Bananaland State golf cham-
pionships, Jim Ferrier played an exhi-
bition game on the Lismore course, and
set up a local record of 74 for the 18
holes. A few days later, that fine country
player J. C. Mclntosh won the Northern
Rivers open title for the third year in
succession with a round of 73. Mclntosh
would have made a name for himself if
he had been able to play metropolitan
golf. With Ivo Whitton, he won the
Queensland foursomes in 1931.

ago bestrode the world recently gave a
lamentable exhibition' in one of the clos-
ing tournaments of the American summer
season. They were Bobby Jones and
Walter Hagen. Jones had not played
golf seriously for a couple of years;
Hagen had been playing the year round
from Canada to Mexico. They tied in
thirteenth place, 10 strokes behind winner
Horton Smith. Both drove from the tees
as well as ever. Both failed on the short
game and on the greens, phases which
count for everything in modern golf—
or ancient, for that matter —and in
which both once excelled all competitors.
“Sturt”: Adelaide’s leading golf clubs,
Seaton and Kooyonga, have had an
unusually exciting match. Legh Winser,
the old champion of the Royal Adelaide,
has modestly dropped himself from first
place to fifth, but Toms, taking his place,
beat Ackland-Horman (K.), the present
champion. With the scores four all, the
second-place men, Astley and Rymill
(K.), went to the 22nd hole before Rymill
sunk an 18ft. putt to win the match.
* * * V
“Susie Swattit”: The N.S.W. women’s
golf championships are set down for
decision at the Royal Sydney links,
beginning July 5 and carrying on to
July 16. There has been a big entry,
not the least gratifying part of it being
the rush from the country. Something
of a gloom has been cast over proceed-
ings by the announcement of the State
champion, Odette Lefebvre, that she will
not defend her title. Recently Odette
had a box-on with the heads of the Ma
L.G.U. because she insisted on turning
out in a competition without stockings.
* >? * *
“Brass Addler”: V. Richardson, holder
among other titles of the Australian pro-
fessional championship, is repeating his
stunt of last year, when he toured the
N.S.W. “smalls,” as the actors have it,
demonstrating and teaching golf to those
desirous to learn. With him again is
C. Gray, the State titleholder, and the
pair are playing through New England
until June 24 at Glen Innes. The last
tour did a tremendous amount of good,
by all accounts, in waking the dry bones
of country golf where experienced profes-
sional teachers are not available. It is
an admirable idea, first begun in
America, and might well be emulated by
other leading professionals in the differ-
ent States. There is good money in it,
too, for the right men.
“Tio Juan”: Cabled that the Ameri-
can open golf championship has been
won by Olin Dutra, the unconventional
Californian professional who won the
Yank professional title in 1932. His
card for the 72 holes was 293, and Gene
Sarazen, winner in 1932, was only a
stroke behind. Australian Joe Kirkwood
tied for twelfth place with 300. Walter
Hagen could scarcely be seen down a long
perspective with 318.
Racquet and Bawl
“Top Spin”: It looks as if our tennis
players have a strenuous time ahead of
them —provided that they survive their
Davis Cup round with France. They
will have to contest the next match in
Italy or Prague, according to whether
Czecho-Slovakia or Italy wins. If suc-
cessful they must come back to Eng-
land to meet the Americans, who will
have remained in England, playing on
grass courts, while our men have had
two engagements on hard courts.
Wimbledon ends on July 8, and, since the
European zone final must be played off
before July 16, and the final begins on
July 21, the Australians will be a pretty
tired lot for this if they last so long.
Apart from that the present system gives
the Americans, fresh from their tinpot
American zone victory, a tremendous
advantage over the European zone win-
ners. There will probably be a change
made for future meetings.
* * * *
“Rev. Knucklebone”: It seems about
time that the folk who send our Davis
Cup teams abroad kept the winning of
the Cup in mind as the first desideratum.
Of late years all energies have been
devoted to making the perambulating
players perform on as many “stands” as
possible, for the sake of the treasury.
There was great rejoicing last year
because, for the first time in its history,
a touring Australian team brought home
£4OO profit. That it left the Cup behind
didn’t seem to bother anyone. Its failure,
after a most promising run, was largely
due to the fact that the team had to play
the part of a troupe of performing
monkeys in a travelling circus. The utter
collapse of Crawford in America and the
staleness of his colleagues is proof enough
of this if any were needed.
* * * *
“Canny Lad”: The Australian tennis
heads are already counting the golden
goblins before they are cashed in. One
tennis writer airily remarked in a Sydney
paper last week that, even if Crawford
and co. failed to survive the D.C. round
against France, they would be certain of
clearing enough cash to pay their way for
the tour and show a profit. The estimates
as set out by this expert show that Aus-
tralia draws £250 for playing in the
French championships, and will probably
be handed £250 for its share of the match
with Japan. Wimbledon has £750 good
money for the team’s showing at the All-
England championships.
ijs JH #
“Cut Shot”: The Ma State tennis heads
have applied to the Australian body for
the fixing of November 23 and 24 for
the match between Vic. and N.S.W., the
State championships filling up the week
to December 1. Under the new rules,
applications for these matches by the
States must be in Melbourne by June
30. The dates will probably be granted,
though, if the present tennis programme
in connection with the centenary and
other tournaments is adhered to, it will
be a tight fit to get it all in before the
end of the year.
jji Sjl »*»
“Kooyong”: The historical coves
who strained at a gnat and swallowed a
camel had nothing on the tin gods of
Victorian tennis. Recently these people
took a high hand with certain insignifi-
cant players suspected of professional
conduct. When last week one of them
applied for reinstatement as an amateur,
he was told that he must purge himself of
his iniquity for 12 months before the
whitewash would be applied. Yet in
Melbourne and elsewhere in Australia
there is scarcely a leading tennis player
who is not infringing the rules defining
an amateur player recently published by
the International L.T.F.
•** * *
The seedings of the draw for Wimble-
don show Crawford heading the list as
last year’s champipn, with Perry second.
Then come Von Cramm, Austin, Shields,
Stoefen, Wood and Boussus. The Ameri-
cans are expected to make a strong bid
for the championships this year, and
since they have had over a fortnight’s
practice and play on English grass courts
they should be in the pink.
Miscellaneous
“Besom”: The other day four rinks
from the Curling Club of Australia
clashed at Melbourne Glaciarium. Lord
Mayor Smith and Norman Brookes were
among the players, as were Moffat-
Spender, founder of the club, and two
ladies. The Lord Mayor’s side won from
that skippered by Brookes by 25 spones
to 16. The club will play in Sydney on
its way to M.L. next month. The High-
land Society of N.S.W. is sending round
the fiery cross for old curlers.
* * * *
“Quarter Butt”: Playing a fortnight’s
match with Walter Lindrum in Brisbane,
which he won by 26,715 to 24,807, Mc-
Conachy put up a new world’s record for
a break under the baulk-line rule. Break-
ing down on the usual sitter, he had
hoisted 1927, or 349 better than Lin-
drum’s previous best, made in England
last year. He used short runs of
his favorite nursery cannons, mixing his
play well. There was not a fluke in the
break, which was made in just under two
hours.
* * * *
“Blue Chalk”: Billiard followers have
been surprised at the total ignoring of
George Gray, once a world’s champion
with the red-ball hazard, by the big chiefs
who seem to be running the centenary
championships to suit themselves. How-
ever, George has managed to start a
splash of his own. He has persuaded
Fred Lindrum, who holds the Australian
title, to take him on for the honor. The
match began this week, but will not
finish until June 30. The game is 16,000
up, 24 sessions, and two sessions each
day. Melbourne is the convincing
ground.
* * H= *
“Fitzcray”: The crowd which runs
Melbourne’s Henley-on-Yarra is spread-
ing itself for the centenary regatta on
November 3. The committee is offering
financial help to some of the other States,
Queensland in particular having been
promised £l2O towards the expenses of
an eight and another £5O for a four. A
senior eight from every State in the Com-
monwealth, in addition to one from
M.L., is aimed at.
* * $
“Spare Ump”: Someone ought to pin
a medal on the man who umpired a
recent baseball game in Sydney, and his
action should be set out in letters of
gold and hung in a conspicuous place
where field games other than baseball
are played. He cancelled the match
under Rule 24 because he was of opinion
that the players on one side “were deli-
berately employing tactics designed to
delay the game.” When the cricket
Board of Control next feels like passing
some new rules, it might consider adopt-
ing this excellent baseball law. Those
who can recall the dashing 10-runs-an-
hour innings often played by Mr. Sut-
cliffe, or have read of even more funereal
performances in England recently by
Messrs. Woodfull and Brown, will heart-
ily agree.
* * H** ❖
“Hotham”: The decision of the Aus-
tralian Bowling Council to refuse the
request of the Victorian B.C. that an
American team of bowlers be welcomed
to Melbourne for the centenary obses-
sion will be greeted with loud applause
by the unhappy inhabitants of Mel-
bourne. Already so many sporting func-
tions of all sorts and descriptions have
been crammed into the centenary year
that it is evident that there will be no
time for work and very little for meals
or sleep. In any case, the Americans are
regarded as professionals by the Inter-
national Board. They play for cash
prizes, some of them considerable.

The Outlook
Wool recovery has suffered a check.
Currency troubles have closed the Ger-
man market for the time being, and other
countries may follow Germany’s example.
Activity in woollens throughout the
world over the last nine months seemed
greatly stimulated compared with previous
slump years. British and Japanese looms
were working at pressure rarely exceeded
in post-war times. In U.S.A., too, there
\ftas a strong spurt. If this activity
was ahead of demand the lower rates
now being collected by the woolgrower
may represent more than a nervous re-
lapse. The price of woollen goods may
have stretched to a figure beyond the
resources of the world’s pockets. On the
other hand, there has been no great
accumulation of the raw material over-
seas, which from a statistical viewpoint
is heartening. Also, if Germany aban-
dons gold, the natural brake of an adverse
exchange would not be so strong as a
definite embargo.
The Sydney wool-price index, which
was 208 in January, was down to 155
on May 16 —a drop which in itself made
further buying-support shaky. The doubt
in the outlook culminated in the post-
ponement of all the June wool sales. In
the Bradford tops market 64’s are now
worth 3 as against 20d. during the
darkest days of the slump.
Despite a poorer season in most pro-
ducing countries, the Australian price of
wheat is still shockingly low, though'up
2{-d. a bushel over the past month. Butter
prices, fortunately, are showing a re-
covery ; but this small advantage is
largely offset by a lower yield.
During April and May investment
stocks on Sydney ’Change were stronger
than at any time since the break in July,
1929. The share market has since taken
the uncertainty in the wool outlook very
calmly ; there has been a slight sag in
some stocks, that’s all. The low rate of
interest on the new Commonwealth loan
may have offset the tendency to change
from industrial investments to more liquid
holdings.
Fortunately, our favorable overseas
trade balance —about £12,000,000 sterling
in excess of our annual overseas interest
requirements during the ten months to
April 31 —has not resulted in an import-
ing boom. The year will probably finish
with a £15,000,000 (stg.) surplus in
London ; but, with the outlook for the
next term uncertain, it will not be such
a heavy load for the banks to carry, and
the problem of bringing down the
exchange rate may be safely shelved until
prices strengthen again.
Saturation Point
The demand for forestry-bonds has
been slackening noticeably over the last
year or so. Whether these bonds will
or will not eventually prove to be good
investments is in the lap of the gods—
where the question has not been defi-
nitely decided in the negative through ex-
travagance and mismanagement. But
thousands of people bought bonds on
the strength of high-pressure sales talk.
A man acquainted with the game re-
marked the other day that the falling-
off in sales could be traced to the supply
of fools being outstripped by the supply
of bonds, and that future sales would be
confined mainly to natural increase
among the fools.
It was rather sweeping, but there’s a
lot of truth in it. Nor does it apply only
to forestry bonds. Gambling in gold
shares has attracted fools as well as those
who know what they are doing. This
new and quicker form of speculation has
encroached on the bond-sellers’ market.
The question now is, when will the
supply of gold shares in new flotations
sate the appetite of speculators?
When it does there will inevitably be
crash, and a separation of the froth from
the real stuff. There is a prevailing
notion that any new gold stock will go to
a premium of about 100 p.c.; and float
after float has been passed out on to the
market during the past few months.
Many of these shows may turn out
sound mining propositions. But as soon
as saturation point is reached —as soon
as those who have been sucked into the
gamble begin to feel the weight of what
they are carrying—gold shares which
have been kept up only by hope and
market manipulation will totter. How
little the new breed of speculators knows
about even the most-talked-of gold stocks
was exemplified by the panic in Tulla-
mores last week, when they toppled
from around 30s. down to 15s.
Proved mines deserve their popularity
with gold at its present price. If they
have enough capital, and are approaching
the production stage, they should be
good for holding irrespective of the
market. But many a mug is going to be
sorry for his flutter in unproved shows.
Cash Orders
A curious sidelight on the depression
is shown in the accounts of cash-order
cos. Though these concerns dealt prin-
cipally with working-class people, who
were affected severely when slump came
along—even those who were not thrown
out of employment had their earnings re-
duced —not many have perished miser-
ably or been forced into reconstructions
through pressure of bad debts. Those
which refrained from pushing clients
have been rewarded for their faith in
the honesty of the Australian worker.
Certainly some of these cos. could
well afford to make liberal provi-
sion against losses out of the high rates
of interest charged in good times. The
prospectus of one concern that started
late and missed the cream of the busi-
ness held out the lure of an effective
49 p.c. gross interest return to attract
share capital. The public, of course,
doesn’t provide all the profit on cash
orders ; the retailer has to cough up part
of it. And with a short-term cash-order,
the interest rate, though high, may not
greatly add to the cost of the article
"Got anything on to-night, Miss Jazza?”
“Oh, Mr. Proctor!.... No; Pm free.”
“Good! I want you to start half an hour earlier in the morning ; so see you
get a good night's rest.”
bought. Many of the big department
stores stoutly withstood the importuni-
ties of cash-order cos. to accept their
paper when times were good ; but with
the general falling-off in trade later on
there was little choice left to them.
So strong has the cash-order system
become, and so devastating the competi-
tion from wireless, that some gramo-
phone distributors have agreed to indem-
nify cash-order cos. to the extent of the
greater part of the retail price of repos-
sessed machines.
Obviously cash-orders fill some kind
of a want with some kinds of people.
Also, with fairly keen competition for
such business, those who avail themselves
of this means of buying things are
not paying such high rates of in-
terest as they were four years ago. But
it is not an economical system. Out of
the gross interest return many cash-order
concerns probably show a comparatively
small net return. The cost of collecting
principal and interest, for one thing,
must be very high.
The Argentine has broken the wheat
agreement. With nearly two months of
the year to go it had exported 5,000,000
bushels in excess of its 110,000,000-
bushel quota up to June 7 ; during May
nearly 180 vessels were chartered to
load grain for European markets. And
now it is asking for an increase in its
quota! The higher world price is the
temptation; it is reminiscent of the
Chinese rubber-growers and the Steven-
son restriction scheme.
* * * H=
Though gross revenue was higher and
working exes, were lower, Australia’s
railways showed a loss of £3,604,875 last
year, equal to 1.07 p.c. on the capital
cost (£325,531,319). The interest bill alone
was £14,081,395. As for the trams,
revenue exceeded working exes, by
£1,834,085. The appalling state of our
railway finances is reflected everywhere
in freight and distribution costs. It may
be some consolation to know that trans-
port is something of a problem the world
over; but nowhere have Governments
interfered with private enterprise to so
little good purpose as in Australia.
* * * *
The sort of boss who demands a
premium to allow a boy to enter his
workshop or office in order to “learn the
business,” and then uses him for run-
ning messages or cleaning inkwells, came
under the eye of Vic. Minister for Labor
Goudie last week. The Engineers and
the Electrical Workers made the com-
plaint ; it was said that parents often
paid £25 or so to get a boy into a work-
shop, there was little chance of appren-
ticeship, and the premium helped to pay
other wages. Then the boy would leave,
and the practice was repeated.
* * * *
“Esters”: France has failed again in
her attempt to prevent Australian wine-
prodiicers from using what she calls the
“regional” names for their produce. Aus-
tralians may still market wines described
on the label as “Burgundy,” “Sauterne”
or “Chablis” types, to take only three
outstanding instances, provided the
country of origin is clearly shown, a
concession Australia has always been
ready to make. France has spoilt her
case by asking too much. For instance,
among the names she desired preserved
for French wines alone were hock and
claret. The first is a generic term for
the German Rhine wines which no
French vineyard produces; the second
is an English-given name bestowed on
what the Frenchman knows only as'the
wine of the Medoc.

Provided guarantees are obtained from
unions, there is every prospect of the
Newnes Investigation Committee’s re-
commendations being put into effect.
Government opinion is that satisfactory
labor arrangements would greatly influ-
ence the successful flotation of the pro-
posed £600,000 co. It is intended to
wind up the Shale Oil Development Com-
mittee, which still has £48,000 in hand
out of the £93,000 voted by the Scullin
Government.

The other day the Kallista Timber
Development Co. was registered in
Hobart (capital, £25,000) with the object
of exploiting the timber of the Upper
Florentine Valley on a large scale. A. W.
Palfreyman, of the Henry Jones Co., is
on the board. The co. has acquired ex-
tensive timber areas in the valley, mostly
sassafras. The development of the
project depends largely upon the exten-
sion of the Derwent Valley railway line.

London butter prices moved up about
2s. a cwt. over the last three weeks. Con-
sumption is still heavy, and there is some-
thing of a drought in England and on the
Continent. On the other hand, Germany
is taking less Danish butter, which is
being diverted to Britain.

“Travel Stain”: Coffee, is it? A
Queenslander who grew it in New Cale-
donia 14 years ago is exhibiting a very
thriving crop in his Brisbane garden.
Thirty years ago there were healthy plan-
tations along the northern littoral, and
the ruins of one are now pointed out to
tourists at Kuranda (N.Q.).

On June 12 11,200 tons of Westralian
wheat was sold afloat or in London at
prices ranging from 3s. to 3s. Id. a
bushel in English currency. London
market for S. Aus. wheat was at about
the same level, but Manitoba was priced
at 3s. 5d., while that of the Argentine
was 2s. Bd. In Chicago the sterling price
was around 4s. a bushel, and at Winni-
peg 3s. 2d. Quotations generally a week
ago were steady in London, higher in
Chicago and Winnipeg, but lower in
other overseas markets. The Sydney
millers’ quotations for bagged wheat on
June 13 was 2s. 11 Id. (Aust.).

“D.E.”: Bandits driving up in a stolen
car threw a brick through the plate-
glass window of Angus and Coote’s,
George-street, Sydney, on Friday night
and cleared out with handfuls of dia-
mond rings. In their flight they shed
rings all over the place, and members
of the public could have got away with
more than the amount stolen. For the
next 15 or 20 minutes men and women
could be seen fighting their way through
a dense crowd—to return rings they had
picked up. Regardless of the newspaper
glamor they could have got, many re-
fused to give their names. Managing-
director E. J. Coote pays a heartfelt
tribute to their honesty.

“Murrawong”: The number of unions
that batten on the man in the wool trade
calls for a reshuffle. A classer who
pays his annual sub. of one guinea
to the Woolclassers’ Association
got a small, early shed across the
border in Queensland and, as the
A.W.U. is paramount there, was
forced to take a ticket—2ss. He
returned to N. S. Wales, where the
shearing season lasted from July
till the end of November. To get
a job as sorter in a city woolstore
he had to join the Storemen and
Packers —entrance fee, 505.; sub.,
16s. That job petered out in two
months. He got another in a wool-
store at Botany, and found he had
to join the Wool and Basil Workers
—£l sub.; entrance fee waived as
he came from an allied union.
When the Botany job closed down,
he was offered another as sorter
in a mill. When he found he would
have to join the Textile Workers, he
decided it was beyond his power to
support five union secretaries out of his
£4 a week, less 10s. fares, so he stayed
at home and mowed the lawn.

“Free Companion”: London “Daily
Herald,” which is always seeing visions
of capitalistic wars, recently published a
summary of the situation, as seen by
itself, which is interesting from any point
of view. The reliable part of the state-
ment was that covering share quota-
tions. Rolls-Royce, whose aeroplane
engines are more important than
their cars, have seen their scrip jump
from 48s. last year to 105 s. Hawker’s,
engine and ’plane-designers and -makers,
have hopped from 11s. 6d. to 225. 6d.
Fairey Aviation shares have gone from
21s. 6d. to 31s. 2d. Sheffield is working
overtime on special steels, and British
salesmen are combing Europe, South
America, China and Japan for orders.

On June 1 the estimated U.S.A. winter
wheat yield had got down to 400,000,000
bushels, compared with an estimate of
461,000,000 bushels a month earlier.
Rains have fallen over part of the
drought-affected wheat areas, but too
late, apparently, to be of much use.

The market for tops at Bradford last
week-end was very quiet. The suspen-
sion of the Australian wool sales is hoped
to steady things. Merinos were a
pound lower on the week, the range being
from 29? d. to 324 d. Crossbred wools
were steadier.

Canada is protesting against the heavy
imports of Australian flour. Under Sec-

agreement Canada may, if her protests
are unheeded, withdraw preferences, in
which case the general tariff would
operate.

“Roman Scandals'*
This, being an Eddie Cantor picture,
is chiefly compounded of the star and
near-nude girls. Eddie, a small-town
American, dreams he is in Imperial
Rome. Part of the fun derives from the
pantomime harlequinades of the nine-
teenth century —as when the Emperor’s
torturers accidentally sit on their red-hot
stove. A climax is reached when the
Emperor swaggers into the torture-cell
and sits on the stove himself. The rest
of the humor has an old-fashioned flavor
also ; papers like the “Pink ’Un” used to
be prosecuted for publishing the kind of
jokes which evoked shouts of merriment
on the first night of “Roman Scandals.”
A colossal sum must have been spent
on backgrounds for the inanities which
follow one another in rapid succession;
and there is a chariot-race towards the
end which is longer, faster and more
catastrophic than any previous chariot-
race.
Sundry Shows
Writer was at the Town Hall for the
first Harty concert in Sydney, and heard
the second over the radio. The latter
experience was not pleasant. It could
be gathered that the orchestra was going
through the motions of the Seventh, and
was struggling with what sounded like
muffled echoes of compositions by
Wagner, Liszt and Richard Strauss,
but the essential beauties of the Harty
interpretations were sunk fathoms deep.
Miss Finneberg was much more kindly
treated in transmission, and it could be
discerned that she has a rich soprano
voice which she can use cleverly. But the
A.B.C. is not up to the task of trans-
mitting Harty - conducted orchestral
music, abounding in sharp contrasts and
comprising everything imaginable in the
scale of volume. Abroad there are some
conductors who do their own broadcast-
controlling, and that seems to be the only
satisfactory system in the present state of
radio technology.
Highlights of Saturday night’s concert
were a vivid performance of Dvorak’s
“New World” symphony and the appear-
ance of Sir Hamilton as a pianist in
Lambert’s “Rio Grande.” The composi-
tion, for voices, orchestra and piano-
forte, and based apparently on jazz tech-
nique, was conducted by Lindley Evans.
Sir Hamilton’s piano-playing is as force-
ful and interesting as his conducting, but
the number was not an unqualified suc-
cess, neither choir nor band being equal
to its eccentricities.
* * *
Melbourne Town Hall was literally
packed for Florence Austral’s fourth
concert on Saturday night. There was
a sparse attendance at Thursday’s
matinee, though the programme was just
as good —Austral and Amadio never let
their audiences down. Their selections
of numbers are almost all of superb
quality, nor do their encores descend
very far down the musical scale. The
bundle of Brahms’s songs was Madame’s
loveliest contribution to Saturday’s feast
of song, but her melodious prayer for
the safety of her lover in the recitative
and aria from Weber’s “Der Freischutz”
did not leave it far behind. Brunnhilde’s
Battle Cry sounded a little less belli-
gerent than of yore. Amadio repeated
the flute sonata, No. 4, of Bach, and it
glided off his lips a miracle of loveliness.
Raymond Lambert functioned efficiently
at the grand.

The most successful of the five one-
act plays presented by the Henry Lawson
Lit. Soc. at St. James Hall, Sydney, was
a dramatisation of Lawson’s “Telling
Mrs. Baker” by Vance Palmer. The
players, including Bertha Lawson as Mrs.
Baker, were well cast. Montgomery
Stuart was at home as Andy McCulloch,
and was well supported by Myra Leard,
Leslie Douglas and young John Quinn.
“Intrigue,” contributed by Sydney Uni.
Dram. Soc., harked back to the days of
Dick Turpin. It bristled with too many
asides to be effective. “Judas Was a
Gentleman,” by Mac Luker, had a neater
plot than any of the other plays, but
Arthur O’Keefe’s Chinaman imposed too
great a handicap. Pacifists in the audience
heartily concurred with the opening
sentiments in Mrs. Alan Clunies-Ross’s
anti-war tract “Dayspring Mishandled,”
and gasped at the militancy of the climax.
Vera Keogh, as the mother who didn’t
bring up her son to be a soldier—even
if she had to shoot him herself—was the
most convincing of the cast. J. le Gay
Brereton’s “So Long, Mick,” with daugh-
ter Lali in the role of Kate and Alfred
Race as the poetic shearer, rounded off
the bill. Proceeds go to the National
Literary Fund.
The resurrection of one Shakspeare, s-aid
to have written several good scenarios,
was announced for ten afternoons at the
Central Hall, Melbourne, commencing
last week, and this critic went along to
survey the miracle in no mood of
optimism. He was pleasantly surprised.
The house was packed, mainly with kids.
Their enthusiasm was extraordinary. It
has only been equalled locally in recent
times by the reception of Walt Disney’s
“Big Bad Wolf.” After the court scene
—the business was “The Merchant of
Venice” —the applause was loud, pro-
longed and perfectly sincere, and it was
deserved. There is no better passage of
dramatic writing in theatrical literature,
and Augustus Neville’s co., which is
Wilkiesperienced and Shaksperienced in
equal parts, was thoroughly up to its job.
Most of the players are old and familiar
hands and served under the redoubtable
Allan’s banner for many years. Neville’s
Shylock was obviously founded on his
former employer’s, but was better, if
anything. There was less of the froth
of passion in him and more of the meat.
When Neville sharpened his knife on the
sole of his boot a thrill passed through
the audience. When Austen Antonio
Milroy bared his breast for a major
operation without benefit of anaesthetic
the thrill was renewed. Mary Portia Kir-
wan was a mixture of forensic cunning
and maidenly charm, and it became a
matter for public rejoicing that her
masterly conducting of the case for the
defendant resulted as it did. The Jessica
of Phyllis Scully was sweetly pagan, if
not particularly Jewish, and the hearty
laughter that greeted Launcelot Gobbo
Paul Hill every time he loitered with
intent to commit a pun shows'" that the
Bard correctly estimated the mental age
of Elizabethan audiences. Fred Mac-
donald, of “Sentimental Bloke” fame,
appeared as Gratiano and graced the part.
A feature of the show was the singing
of the lyrics by Mollie Warden. The
staging was cramped but adequate. “A
Midsummer Night’s Dream” was next on
the bill.
* * *
The coming theatrical season should
recall the glories of pre-depression days.
J.C.W. is in conference with the Rus-
sian Ballet, and Fullers are meditating
grand opera on a heroic scale. Amongst
Australians ordered are Browning Mum-
mery and Francesca Duret, both Mel-
bourne singers. Mummery was here
last with the Williamson-Melba company
of 1928, when he kicked his heels for
three weeks without singing a note,
owing to the plethora of tenor leads.
Miss Duret left Melbourne for Italian
study in 1923, and her coloratura soprano
has been heard in northern Italy and
Spain.
* * *
A nice girl, in an Australian city un-
named, being disrespectfully treated by
a prospective employer, knocked him
down and left his office in haste, to learn a
httle later that (a) she had left her handbag
behind as evidence, and (b) the blighter
had been found dead. Such is the brisk
opening of “A Lady’s Handbag,” which
Adelaide Repertory Theatre named as
winner of its prize competition (open to
all Australia), and has now played twice
to its 1000 members. The author is C. H.
Hague, a retired banker of Adelaide. He
has treated the tragedy as seen through
the eyes of a pleasant suburban house-
hold ; and it works up through humorous
dialogue and clever character-drawing to
a satisfactory ending. The play should
have a wide appeal to any Australian
public, when pruned a bit towards the
talkative finish. James Glennon and
Phyllis Simpson shared the acting honors
as rough-tongued but kindly veterans,
Florence Broun and Iris Marks did fine
work in small parts.
* * *
The announcement that the Apollo
Theatre will open in Melbourne on
the 23rd with the Merry Malones does
not mean that somebody has sec-
retly foisted a new playhouse on the
community overnight. The new Apollo
is merely the old Palace with a fresh
coat of paint, a new orange curtain, a
winter garden and the biggest Neon light
in Australia as a beacon. Fullers are
responsible for the new outbreak, which
meditates a centenary season of Wag-
nerian opera. George M. Cohan was
responsible for “The Merry Malones.”
Delysia is looming at the Princess. “The
Beloved Vagabond” sang himself off the
premises on Saturday last. Sylvia Well-
ing and co. will serve a fresh helping of
French courtesanry at the King’s on the
30th, when “Madame Pompadour” will
supplant “The Dubarry” in monarchical
esteem. “Fresh Fields” is still holding
the fort at the Comedy, and Jim Gerald
is pursuing “The Stolen Garter” at the
Tivoli.

NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
Fiji’s Population
“Kaloa”: The Maoris are not the only
native race in the Pacific that is increas-
ing. The Fijians have taken to civilisa-
tion like ducks to water. They manage
most of their own local-government
affairs. Last year their numbers increased
to 2500 to 95,000 —16 p.c. more than in
1921. Fiji, moreover, is a strong runner
for the Prosperity Stakes among the
Pacific groups. It has had a consistent
trade credit balance since 1918, and this
was maintained even in 1933, when
it was equal to 50 p.c. of the value of
imports despite the fall in the price of
copra. Ten years ago its public finances
had an accumulated deficit of £193,000,
but it has turned this into an accumu-
lated surplus of £196,000, and it
has a Government reserve fund of
£453,000 tucked away. Its total revenue
is about £3 per head —more than half of
it from customs duties. But the A.W.U.
is not likely to recommend its wage-
taxed members to emigrate to Suva —
unskilled labor can be had there for as
little as 2s. 6d. a day.
“Felis”: Queensland has set up a new
record. It is the first British State out-
side Ireland in which the leading morn-
ing newspaper has found it necessary to
turn out a three-page supplement to
record the wins in a local lottery. The
best of the rewards of luck went to other
States. It is amusing to see a Govern-
ment which is “all for Queensland and
the equality of man” handing out such
capitalist fortunes to “foreigners.”
* * * *
“Cally”: You can tell “Kuranda” (B.
13/6/’34) that coffee is still grown at
Buderim, in Queensland’s North Coast
district, and since living in the district
I’ve had no other coffee than that grown
by Simpson, who markets first-rate stuff.
He has been at the game for many years
now. The first coffee grown in Australia
was produced along the Bloomfield River,
south of Cooktown, over 60 years ago,
where tea was also successfully cultivated.
*** . *
“Travel Stain”: Mention of the rail-
way line near Mildura (B. 13/6 / ’34) over
which no train has ever run recalls
a white elephant in Cape York Penin-
sula, the Laura Bridge. The line runs
for 67 miles out of Cooktown to the
Laura River, over which a massive con-
crete and steel bridge was built more
than 40 years ago at a cost of £27,000.
The line was then to go on to the Gulf.
The railway still pulls up about a quarter
of a mile from the river.
* * * *
A. E. J. Austin, recently elected
to the Brisbane Council by Nundah,
which includes in its boundaries the
Q.T.C. racecourse, wants all holders of
weekly tickets on the trams to have the
right to use them on race days at Ascot,
apart from the one journey each way
each day to which they are now entitled,
provided they live in the Ascot district.
As one who has made a name for him-
self in connection with racing, one can
appreciate the alderman’s gesture. But
Arthur Edward John was once also a
footballer, so why not extend the privilege
to those desiring to see Rugby League at
Brisbane C.G. or Union at the Exhibi-
tion?
* * * *
“Kaloa”: Two Frenchmen touring the
world in a junk have discovered an un-
charted island in the Aru Sea, and pro-
pose to seize it for the Republic. They
should have kept quiet about it—they
could have established a colony there and
nobody would have been the wiser. There
are dozens of better empty islands up
that way anyhow. The only pity is that
they cannot be cleated to a tug and
hauled to Europe, where there is a good
market for islands. I remember that
mountain speck Pantellaria, which heaves
itself out of the sea below Sicily, ter-
raced from water’s edge to peak with
intense cultivation.
* * * *
Sir Hubert Murray, Lt.-Governor of
Papua, to the Prime Minister:—-
My attention has been drawn to a state-
ment in The Bulletin (27/12/’34) headed
“Sago for Brown Brother,” and suggesting that
we might save money by making use of sago
as a native food instead of rice. The sug-
gestion seems, at first sight, such a reasonable
one that it is worth while to explain why we
do not, in fact, use sago.
_ The reason is that it has been tried several
times in Port Moresby, and has been found
too expensive. Sago is, however, used in
Daru, where the supply is nearer at hand, and,
on occasion, elsewhere.
The objection to sago is, the Chief Medical
Officer informs me, that it contains none of
the vitamins necessary to health and very little
protein, say six per cent. The partially-milled
rice generally used in Papua contains protein
and a certain amount of two of the vitamins.
The Chief Medical Officer adds:
“Neither European nor native can be kept in
good health by bread, rice or sago alone.
Their diet has to be enforced by extras such
as meat, fish, green food, vegetables and fruits
if health and working power are to be main-
tained. If we used sago on a large scale in-
stead of rice the quantity of these expensive
extras would have to be increased.”
* * * *
“Lugger’s Mate”: Ex-naval men
manned luggers and other Japanese
vessels in N.A. waters as far back as
1908. I recall vessels built in Cairns,
ostensibly for white owners, that went to
sea under Japanese names. Before
Federation, with a lot of Jap coolies who
worked on the Hambledon and other
sugarcane plantations were 50 to 70
naval and army reservists, all educated
and intelligent. They were joined after-
wards by their wives, and some of them
went into the pearl-shell industry. This
bit of history explains why two Royal
Commissions sat between 1908 and 1915,
taking evidence from Brisbane to T.I. in
regard to the pearl and beche-de-mer
industries, and the extent to which
foreign influence controlled them. The
war came along inopportunely, and so
the reports were pigeon-holed.
.J. .j. »j{
“II Vecchio”: It is no wonder that
there is talk of British preference in the
sugarfields. Although immigration of
“ He’s playing by ear”
"No fear —I bin seeum fingers movin’.”
Italians only really began after the war,
they almost completely monopolise em-
ployment at some mills. At Macnade,
the nationalities of cutters now are: Aus-
tralian and British, 10; Yugoslav, 9;
Spanish, 18; Italian, 400. On the
Tully a resolution of the A.W.U. to limit
foreign dilution of labor to 25 per cent,
has been rescinded. It won’t be long
at the present rate of progress before the
whole sugar population is either Italian
or Italian-born Australian. However, as
a large proportion of them are big, fair
Lombards who blend well with our own
races, each year will see a bigger absorp-
tion into the Australian population. A
lot of the youngsters now growing up
will never speak la lingua del si, and
many of those already grown are mar-
rying girls of British stock.
* * * *
“Durah”: As an old Downsman, lam
perturbed to read that an average of 26
bags of maize to the acre secured by
one of our sturdy yeomen within 50
miles of Toowoomba was beaten by a
rival who, a week later, recovered 30T
bags. It recalls old days when I shared
the triumph of Aloysius McFlannigan,
who flaunted a new maize which
had 17 rows of grain to the cob —
I won’t swear that it wasn’t 57 rows, my
experience of the great agricultural
industry having been brief. The neigh-
borhood drank itself nearly into delicious
trimmings over McFlannigan’s invention.
The bank manager again condescended
to have a drink with him, and there were
rumors that he had wangled an overdraft.
The McFlannigan girls were besieged by
suitors, one of them being the alleged
heir of an earl —he was scrub-cutting for
£1 a week. Then came the crash. Alistair
Ecclefechan came to light with a cob going
18 rows —or it may have been 58. The
bank called up McF.’s short loan, the
publican refused him further credit, and
Alistair and his red-headed daughters
became the social leaders of the locality ;
it is even rumored that one of them
married a bank clerk. Old McF. died
swearing that his ghost would howl
round the chimney-pots of the Ecclefe-
chan establishment for ever and a day.
* * * *
“Retired Urger”: When Brennan, J.,
of Queensland, referred to some youths
brought before him as enjoying “Free
Love and Bingo” he started philologists
guessing. Then ’Sonah explained that
“Bingo” is a public gambling institu-
tion in which contributors at 6d. a pick
are allowed to do some guessing on
horseracing—many of Sydney’s minor
hotels run the same joke, but under a
different name. Writer, with some know-
ledge of spieling in Queensland, avers
solemnly that this explanation of
“Bingo” is unknown to him. But, in the
early ’nineties on Charters Towers, every
other young fellow of Cornish extrac-
tion whose name was William was
known as “Bingo.” Sometimes one met
Old and Young Bingo, and perhaps
Uncle and Cousin Bingo. Ingoldsby has
a verse about a Franklin’s dog which
leapt o’er a stile, his name being “Little
Bingo,” so the name must have been
widespread. Barham of the “Legends”
was a Kentishman.
* * * *
“Joss Stick”: Some years ago when
the Queensland Government stopped the
indiscriminate cutting of sandalwood,
giving a company sole royalty rights, there
was the usual yowl from the Parliamen-
tary Opposition about injustice to the
individual. The company worked on
specified areas, was restricted to cutting
of trees over a certain diameter, and its
operations could easily be watched by
the C.L. rangers and other officials. In
earlier days anything big enough to be
ground up into powder for incense came
down, with the result that supplies were
in danger of being wiped out. The
contract expired on June 14, and the
Government is to give an open go to
cutters, with the proviso that all the stuff
must be turned in to State depots and
sold by the Government alone. The
Government will market 500 tons yearly.
What cutters will sell under the lap any
northerner can guess.
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
The Queensland Bush Book Club, of which
Mrs. Ormond Smith is president and Mrs.
Firmin McKinnon secretary, collected 1000
volumes and a large pile of magazines on the
day of its annual appeal. The organisers pro-
vided afternoon-tea for the visitors. The books
were in good condition, of recent publication,
and, best of all, included numerous works by
Australian authors.
Lena Hammond, Brisbane’s sole woman choir
conductor, will stage her first concert this
year at the Albert Hall on June .23. The
second half of the programme will be devoted
to Bach’s “Magnificat,” in which the soloists
are Nell Johnson, Doris Wilde, Nell Burnett,
Leslie Carter and Jack Foster. The girls
choir will give Klein’s “Triste Noel.” Miss
Hammond’s choir numbers over 100, and the
lads and lassies are extremely keen on their
The Mater Ball is the only big show of the
year at which a special cake is provided tor
the debs. It will have to be large this time,
for 20 young things will emerge from the
chrysalis stage to-night (Wednesday). Ihe
sisters urgently need funds, especially tor the
children’s section, and, since non-Catholics out-
number the Catholic patients, the general public
is being asked to dip into its pockets.- Mrs.
H. J. Windsor is president of the ball committee
again.
The H. I. Cohens, of Melbourne, after seeing
daughter safely married to the Morell son,
wandered round getting sidelights here on Child
Welfare work. They looked in at the Spring
Hill Creche and Kindergarten.
The Legacy Club, which has accepted the
care and education of children of dead and in-
capacitated Diggers, has just held a ball at
the Trocadero to help the funds along Presi-
dent Ralph White and his wife —the lady in
gold crepe with silver roses —greeted the visi-
tors, who included the Acting-Premier and Mrs.
Pease. Seeing that the club doesn’t consider
its work done when its charges have completed
their education, but also moves heaven and
earth to find them jobs, it deserves all the sup-
port it can get.
A spring flower show and art exhibition will
be put on early in August by the Historical
Society. Lady Mayoress Jones is president or
the committee making the necessary arrange-
ments, and on June 15 a bridge party was
held at Newstead House, where the society has
its rooms, at which Nell Phelan and Betty
Ghee were hostesses. , , _ ,
Barbara Corrie, daughter of the Douglas

tian Federation, which has branches in 40
countries and a membership of 300,000.
Eddie Cahill recently
returned from the south
to begin the chain of
recitals which he intends
to give before leaving for
England.
Mrs. G. A. Carter,
wife of the Under-Sec-
retary for Justice, who
has been seriously ill for
some months, is now
well on the mend.
Barrister Gillies, for-
merly Registrar of the
Supreme Court, Towns-
ville, will take up his
duties as Registrar of the
Supreme Court, Bris-
bane, early in July.
Maureen Leeper, a
daughter of the legal
clan with headquarters at
Warwick, has been holi-
daying in Queensland.
She spent some time in
Warwick, and then
paused awhile in Bris-
bane, where brother Tom
hangs out. The lady has
returned to Sydney.
Mrs. George Rose, who
was Dolly Thornton, the
prettiest sister of a bevy
of beauties, died recently.
Her sisters are Mrs.
Alex. Mutch—mother of
Mrs. Molesworth, the
tennis champion and
Mrs. Hugh Douglas,
whose barrister husband
was killed in the recent
war. He was a brother
of the two Justices Doug-
las, of Townsville and
Brisbane.
®jMrs. R. G. Beggs, president of the Victorian
Country Women’s Association, spent some days
in Brisbane with her husband after attending
the C.W.A. conference in Rockhampton. Mrs.
F. de Little —she was a Cowlishaw, daughter
of the Honorable James, who, with the Hon.
George, controlled the destinies of the Brisbane
“Telegraph” for so many years—rattled the
teacups in the lady’s honor.
When the superintendent of the Armidale
ambulance brigade hastened to an accident, he
little expected to discover that the victims
were two old acquaintances from Toowoomba.
One was Miss E. G. Hely, who has chronicled
the social doings of the Downs for almost
half a century; and the other Miss K. M.
Rail. Miss Hely is a cousin of Con Drew,
the sportsman-author, and also a cousin of
Mrs. O’Neill Brenan, of Brisbane. Her father
was an officer in one of the early regiments
stationed in Brisbane, and there are relatives
in most of the eastern States.
The Lyceum Club, at its annual meeting,
elected Mrs. B. F. Robson, M.A., to the
president’s chair, and made Mesdames Ed.
Munro and Firmin McKinnon honorary vice-
presidents.
Bertha Clarke, who spent some years in
Asia, and who now is putting her first-
hand knowledge to account by personally con-
ducting parties of tourists hither and yon in
Japan and China, blew in with her party. One
of her old friends in the Flowery Land gave
her a set of 16 volumes of Shakspeare, trans-
lated into Japanese by an old gentleman of
75 whose name needs most of the alphabet to
spell it correctly.
The Lathams were entertained and the re-
marks of the male partner listened to breath-
lessly by businessmen during their stay here
after missioning in the North. The skipper of
the Kitano Maru gave them a Sayonara dinner,
with an arch of peace, made of sugar, as one
of the table decorations.
Alexia Drake has written three short plays,
which Rhoda Felgate produced on June 18 in
the society’s rooms. Miss Drake had a role
in each play, and her work has received the
warm praise of those who are competent to
judge. All the good fairies must have been at
Alexia’s christening party. She has good looks,
brains, a gifted pen and a charming manner.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
The Dental Undergrads.’ Ball was great
fun. For the guessing competition the
prize was a magnum of champagne. The
male ballet was amusing, the dancers
wearing masks with their white gowns
and rubber gloves. Purple and white
pennants flew above the official table, and
John May was president of the flutter.
Dr. A. W. Arnott and Mrs. Arnott were
special guests. The neck of her black
velvets wore three gold lame roses. A
spray of golden garden roses adorned one
shoulder of Nancy Withycombe’s peri-
winkle-blue laces. Sylvia Cook’s necklet
of green stones in its antique silver setting
won admiring glances.
Poinsettias flamed, balloons bobbed
and colored lanterns revolved at the
Palais Royal when 1000 young things
from the various insurance cos. and their
friends danced in the interests of the
Industrial Blind Institution and the Braille
Library. H. G. L. Harrison was presi-
dent of the ball. His wife, in mulberry
velvets, presented the debs, to the
Mayoral lady, whose satins were gera-
nium red. Miss Birkin, who accompanied
her, wrapped her pale-gold chiffons
in a coat of deeper hue, and secretary
Olive Dowd pinned green orchids on the
shoulder of her white crepes. President
of the Institution Consett Stephen chatted
amiably. Jean Mackay wore a flounced
frock of lipstick-red chiffons. The Arthur
Eedys were there, and J. B. Young was
in charge of the treasury.
Again some member of the Stock
Exchange has shown imagination. The
ticket of admission to the Contango Club
Ball was a replica of a share-transfer
and was stamped “scrip in office” when
presented at the Blaxland Galleries.
Inside, the hall was one of animation.
There was a ticker machine; couples
watched the tape expectantly, and boys
rushed round with the ticked-out mes-
sages, reading “Recommend you buy all
the fun you can ; sell moans and groans.”
The arrival of the Tyrolese dancers after
“White Horse Inn” put up its shutters
added one more thrill.
Acting-Governor Street and his lady
paid a visit to The Bulletin’s Macleod
Gallery last week. They came without
ceremonial fuss and spent a big slice of
the afternoon in looking at the pictures,
discussing them and the artists. The
former C.J. is one of the trustees of the
National Gallery, and his collection of
Australian etchings is very fine. Briga-
dier-General Anderson was in attendance.
Old boys of King’s School are asked
to earmark July 20 for the annual dance.
The Blaxland Galleries will be the scene
of action.
As fascinating as a tale from “The
Arabian Nights” are the talks that are
being given daily by G. E. Thornton, An-
thony Horderns’ expert on Persian car-
pets. He will show you the famous Santa
Sophia rug taken from the temple of
that name ; and if you ask him he will
point out the slash made by the weaver’s
knife when he found his work was per-
fect, for “Allah only is perfect.” He
will tell you the history of the
Ardebil carpet (now in South Ken-
sington Museum) and the fate that befel
the gorgeous carpet designed to bring
into the winter home of the king the
illusion of spring. In this the flowers and
the paths and running water are woven
in precious stones. He will read to you
the Arabic characters on the cartouches,
and he will show you the pall rugs, the
temple veil and many others. And in
future you will find the buying of car-
pets an adventure (for many of the pat-
terns are copied in Axminster and Wilton)
and not just a matter of price and size.
The Poynters adopted Stella Mar-
guerite Malkin for her wedding day, and
did everything her parents would have
done if they had been in Sydney and
not in England. Sir Hugh gave her into
the safe keeping of Lieut. Frank Lever-
son George, R.A.N., and Frank’s fellow-
officers’ swords flashed an arch of greet-
ing outside St. Mark’s. Honiton lace,
generations old, formed the bridal veil
and edged the square train that hung
from the shoulder of the magnolia satin
gown. A circlet of orange-blossoms and
an armful of arum-lilies and lily-of-the-
valley were fragrant accessories. Rose-
mary George, Valerie Bavin, Shirley and
Jocelyn Poynter ’maided in angel-skin
pervenche-blue lace, their hands filled
with white camellias and hyacinths. Toasts
were honored at Bayard, the Point Piper
home of the bridegroom’s parents, where
Lady Poynter assisted Mrs. George
receive the guests.
The bride is the daughter of the Sydney
Malkins, of Cheadle, Staffordshire. She
is only 19, has the English pink-and-
white complexion and her poise is re-
markable. She met her husband four
years ago when he was visiting Eng-
land. But they hadn’t seen each other
for two years until she arrived about
three weeks ago, complete with trousseau
and marvellous wedding gifts in the way
of old silver. Since her arrival she has
been the guest at numerous parties, and
her wedding could not have been a more
friendly affair if she had grown up in
Sydney.
A marriage of interest to the pioneer-
ing families was that of Elizabeth Bligh
and Marsden Campbell. Elizabeth, the
daughter of the medical Arasmus Blighs,
of North Sydney, is a descendant of
Admiral John Bligh (a cousin of Gov-
ernor Bligh), and the groom, a son of
the A. Campbells, of Waverton, has for
an ancestor the Campbell from whom
Campbelltown takes its name. Cream
velvet, billows of tulle, a coronet of
pearls and a sheaf of arum-lilies made up
the wedding raiment. Sister Barbara and
Audrey Russell were attractive attend-
ants in mediaeval frocks of magnolia
velvet girdled in silver. The reception
was at the home of the bride’s parents.
Chairs are so closely packed together
for the A.B.C. symphony concerts that
there’s hardly knee-room. But the thou-
sands who surge up the Town Hall steps
are pleased that they can get in, and sit
warmly expectant, unmindful of discom-
forts.
Laelia Finneberg reminds somewhat of
Toti dal Monte. She acknowledges the
applause with a fascinating smile and a
delightful curtsy. Her gown on Wed-
nesday was black, cut high at the front,
but low at the back. Her sleeves, tight
to the elbow, blossomed into a white
wideness that reached to the knuckles.
On Saturday she sat with Beryl Ross in
the body of the hall, her red shoes and
red flower over one ear matching the
geranium-red of her chiffons.
Most of those who went to the first
concert went to the second and third.
The Alexander Gordons, with Ann as
slim as a pine in her black taffetas, sat
on high, as did the C. L. Jones couple
and knight Henry Braddon. Dean
Talbot’s wife, Mrs. Florence Taylor, the
Lashmars, Margaret and Phyllis Hughes,'
Beatrice Tange, Mrs. T. H. Kelly, a
coronet of pink camellias and green
leaves in her hair, Flora and Alice Dan-
ciger, the E. G. Roberts couple, the King
lady, Mollie Street, Archbishop Mowll
and Constant Lambert’s kinswoman Dag-
mar Roberts were among the applauders
of a very tired-looking Sir Hamilton at
the end of each evening.
Helen Williams
smiles at you
from this pencil
drawing. Helen,
who is the daugh-
ter of Mrs. E.
Williams, of
Edgecliff, has a
disc riminating
taste in books, as
befits a journal-
ist’s daughter.
Her father was
appointed general
manager of the
A.B.C. at its in-
ception, and held
that position until
his death last
year.
The Henry
Lawson Literary
Society commem-
orated the poet’s
birthday by put-
ting on five one-
a c t Australian
plays at St.
James’s. The little
hall was crowded
with writers and
their friends, but,
as the price of
admission was
small, the
National Liter-
ary Fund will not
be swelled to any
great extent. Pro-
fessor Sadlier was
among the inter-
ested ; .so was
Dr. Mackaness.
Peter Osborne’s
mother tried to
hide her pride in
hi s personation
of a young man
of fashion in “In-
trigue.” Windeyer, K.C., was a front-
seater. Alan Clunies-Ross brought his
wife ; her “Springtime Mishandled” was
on the bill. With them sat Jeannie
Ranken. If Mac Luker, author of “Judas
Was a Gentleman,” was present, he
wasn’t obtrusive.
There were speeches of regrets and
speeches of welcome at the Kinder-
garten Union’s annual meeting. Miss
Slack, the new principal of the Training
College, and H. D. Hall, the new presi-
dent, were welcomed. S. S. Cohen, the
retiring president, was presented with a
pencil drawing of the Training College
by J. B. Godson, enveloped in good
wishes for his health and expressions of
sorrow over his retirement from the chair
he has occupied for 13 years. W. G.
Layton, Major Conder and H. D. Hall
all spoke of the good work done by the
kindergartens, and sec. Kathleen Chase
was kept busy moving the “mike” so
that their words would be broadcast.
Thanks to the show of antiques, which
brought in £930, and two “art unions,”
from which £2OOO was netted, the finances
of the union are satisfactory. After all
this was recounted to women representa-
tives from the different “kinder” centres
there were tea and cakes for all.
Manly has now its own Red Cross
Society, of which Mrs. Gilbert Nobbs is
president, and Mrs. A. B. Coleman pub-
licity officer. The Village’s Mayor took
the chair at the meeting that formed the
branch, and everyone was very en-
thusiastic.
Among those at the opening of the
Australian Art Society’s Exhibition were
Elaine Coghlan, all in black, and her
mother, Ethel Cotterill, all in brown,
Judge Backhouse, Howard Hinton, Jean
Wells, whose brown hat sported a rasp-
berry feather, Edward Hirst, who breeds
Dalmatians with such success, and Dr.
and Mrs. Huff Johnson. The more shows
we have the better for the painters and
for the g.p., according to Jimmy Mc-
Donald’s speech. Late in the afternoon
Archbishop Mowll slipped in, and had
finished the first room before someone
sent word in to the heads. Then William
Oates did the honors.
Mrs. Bruce Barnier, of Avondale,
Gravesend, is down staying with her
mother, Mrs. Gilbert Nobbs, at Craig-
lands, Manly. Captain Nobbs (he’s
governing director of Holbrooks, the
sauce people) has been in England, but a
cable last week told of his leaving for
Toronto, Canada, where his old regiment,
London Rifle Brigade, is stationed. He
will be there, too,- for the festivities in
connection with Prince George’s visit.
England’s royalties appear to like the
Captain, who is a friend of the Prince of
Wales. The two spent many an hour
together during H.R.H.’s visit to Sydney.
Captain Nobbs also knows Prince
George intimately (if you can use that
word about a friendship with a prince),
and during this last visit to England he
had a private interview with the King
at St. James’s Palace.
The Captain lost his eyesight in the
war, but did not let that interfere to
any great extent with his life. He is
Holbrooks. He pays yearly business
visits to England and America, and
always he goes unacccompanied. When
staying at Craigieburn he rides and plays
golf.
Its committee says the Movie Ball will
be the most spectacular event Sydney has
ever seen. There are to be a pageant and
a broadcast of the second Test match.
Australian movie stars will be present.
Date is June 26 ; place, Palais Royal ;
and beneficiary, the Motion Picture
Benevolent Fund.
Members of the Croydon Ladies’ Social
Club have an eye for the spectacular, so
there is always color and pageantry in the
presentation of debs, at the annual ball.
This year there were 23. All wore silver
coronets and white frocks, and carried
muffs of white and pink satin. They
paced gravely behind six little pale-blue-
pink-and-green-clad flower-girls. A white -
and-gold herald headed the procession.
The Julius lady gave the youngsters the
freedom of the social world. Ashfield’s
Mayor, W. E. Grainger, brought daughter
Dorothy, in rosy marocains. Mrs. J.
Scherrenberg was president of the ball.
Ashfield Town Hall was the scene. The
Far-West Flying Clinic benefits, and the
Stanley Drummond couple, Mrs. Arthur
Scrivener and Muriel Fletcher were in
the official group.
If the Goodwill Mission made as
favorable an impression on the countries
visited as their inhabitants made on Mrs.
Latham and daughter Freda, its objec-
tive has been amply achieved. Every-
where they met with the utmost friendli-
ness, and particularly kind were the
people of Sourabaya, where Freda was in
hospital nursing an injured knee. Here
their enforced stay was made pleasant by
visitors and presents of books and
flowers. The Lathams were too late for
the cherry blossom in Japan, but found
the azaleas fascinating.
The Grosvenor Galleries are hung
around with geraniums, zinnias, oleanders
and such-like beauties, the work of Grace
Scott-Ross. This artist is a Queenslander.


Melbourne
Chatter
There’s a new ladies’ tote at Moonee
Valley which should prove a boon on
days of rain and squelch. Unless the
voice of the bookie proves too alluring,
the woman punter can make her bets,
watch the race and collect (if she's
lucky) all under one roof. She can even
enjoy the protection of a verandah while
trying to catch the eye of the dancing
chestnut in the saddling paddock. There
was a bite in the air on Saturday, but
the rain obligingly held off till after
dark.
Very hard to wear, but a success
on a young girl, was a coat and cap,
black with a sprinkling of white hair,
which gave an iron-grey impression. Mrs.
J. Thomas wore luscious furs and a
sparkle of diamond earrings. Mrs.
Grant Hay’s cocoa foxes were the com-
plement of a three-quarter-length coat
and skirt. Alison Moule was in one of
her favorite tweed suits. Mrs. P. H. Locke
chose black, and her velvet headpiece be-
longed to the over-one-eye school of
thought. Mrs. J. F. Chambers wore a
belt with her heavily-furred oyster tweed
coat, and Mrs. W. Mortill 'kept her
ankles snug in fur-topped boots. Mrs.
Ivan Gutmann’s brown berette owed its
inspiration to some bad, bold pirate of
the Spanish Main. Doris Newman had
a blue jumper under her suit; Mildred
Vaughan was all bright blue and Winnie
Kellow showed a glimpse of flame blouse
under her chocolate tweeds. Mrs.
Brendon O’Sullivan baited her aristo-
cratic fur collar with violets.
Jean Batten stepped off the Sydney
express with a black, furry ball clasped
over one arm. This was Buddy, the small
kitten given to the flying girl by the Diggers
at Randwick. Though they were both
staying in the same hotel, Buddy and his
mistress didn’t see much of one another,
for Miss Batten had very little time to
herself. On her first day here (the train
arrived at midday) she called upon the
Governor, attended a civic reception in
the Town Hall, shared a luncheon chop
with the Business and Professional
Women and was entertained at Anzac
House by the Returned Army Nurses’
Club and the Returned Soldiers’ League.
Then came a cocktail party at Menzies,
followed by dinner, and it was after 2
a.m. before a very weary but still smiling
young woman got into bed.
The cocktail party was an inspiration
of Wakefields, Ltd., guests being Mel-
bourne’s press gang and a light sprink-
ling of others. At first it seemed for men
only, so few were the feminine hats and
faces bobbing on the horizon. Miss
Batten wore no hat, and a tonic for her
long, dark travelling dress was a scarlet
splash of “bib” collar. Her poise and
oratory produced an excellent impression.
Wakefields’ W. H. Brash, was host, and
speeches were made by Theodore Fink
and Allan Spowers. A grandfather cray-
fish with wings made from the shells of
some of his relations and an electric light
hidden in a propeller of claws was
surrounded by decorative savories on a
dish of abnormal proportions. Sticks
that pierced the hearts of cocktail saus-
ages were modestly covered up by frilly
paper “legs” in patriotic red, white and
blue.
It’s a very exceptional woman who is
made the reason for a party at a men’s
club ; but the West Brighton Club rose
to the occasion of Miss Batten,. and is
patting itself on the back that she ac-
cepted its invitation to dine. Fred Lee
proposed the visitor’s health, and spoke
of the honor a young girl was confer-
ring upon a group of middle-aged men,
for her brief stay here was crammed with
engagements. Miss Batten declared she
saw no sign of middle-age in the men
and women around her, whom she com-
pletely subjugated by her commonsense
and attractive accent. In the unavoid-
able absence of the president’s wife, Mrs.
Alurid Kelly, Dr. Alva Boyd was hostess.
The International Club concerns itself
only with the entertainment of foreigners,
but it stretched a point for Jean Batten
and got up an impromptu party which
overflowed the chair space. Miss Batten
came in a smart little brown beret pulled
well over one eye and a dose of canary
jumper under the upstanding fox collar
of her tweed coat. She managed two
cups of tea and a handshake for every-
one before dashing off to keep another
date. She contrives to vary her speeches
on every occasion, this time adding that
she’d never been asked her opinion on
any subject before landing in Darwin ;
neither had she made speeches, except
to an infuriated family (success only
middling!).
Loreto Old Girls held their dance at
No. 9, where log fires and glowing cones
of radiators sent a comforting warmth
down spines that otherwise would have
shivered. With their partners, 11 all-
white debs, trod a red carpet to exchange
a curtsy for a smile from the associa-
tion’s president, Mrs. A. S. Morton, after
which they were whirled off into “Danc-
ing in a Dream.” Vice-pres. Mrs. J. J.
Daly refreshed her black gown with gold
upon the neckline. All-pink secretary
Helen Skehan had a wreath of carna-
tions round her neck. One scarlet-clad
maid wore a necklet of real mignonette,
and among the fresh-flower hairbands
was a youthful frivolity of sweet-smell-
ing daphne. The red-and-blue boat-
shoulders of Wilma Murphy’s sprigged
muslins were repeated in the coloring
round her ankles. Sister Julie’s dashing
chintz design contained a liberal dose of
black. With her moonstone brocade,
Evelyn Lightfoot wore a rising-sun tiara.
Mrs. J. A. Corby trailed long-sleeved
parchment satin. Peggy Maquire, a
young Queensland visitor who is cherish-
ing movie aspirations, came like an old-
world picture in white tulle, corkscrew
curls and a carnation behind one ear.
With a finger loop, Blanche Fitz Gerald
ensured the safety of her lizard-green
train—the gown had silver shoulders and
unexpected portholes here and there.
The longest earrings in the room dangled
to the shoulders of a lass in black and
sparkling scarlet sequins. Mary Cogh-
lan’s white lace was frivolous with tulle.
Little deb. Mary Neylon was all chiffon,
silver leaves and anxiety about the man-
agement of her first train.
The afternoon wedding persists, all our
most fashionable knot-tying being per-
formed in daylight. Marna Cox came
all the way from Wombat Park to Christ
Church, South Yarra, to keep her ap-
pointment with J. E. S. Anderson, of
N. S. Wales. Also from Daylesford came
bunches of late autumn leaves and
berries, and as long a journey was made
by the Bishop of Bendigo, who forged
the marriage link. The bridal garment
with its draped neckline and burst of
sleeves above the elbow crept into a long
train, over which fell a cloudy tulle veil
that descended from a simplicity ban-
deau of satin. Betty Caddy and Marie
Greene, who tied gerberas with olive-
green ribbon to match the velvet leaves
in their hair, followed on a wave of
flame-tinted velvet. Bride’s sister, Mrs.
Astur Brooke, came from India to stand
beside her father, H. M. S. Cox, at the
reception at No. 9. There rejoicings sped
among small teatables, each adorned with
a combination of the practical and the
artistic, a posy of mixed blooms.
Here is dancer Dorothy Hutchison
wearing curls and the tulle which she
lias chosen for her interpretation of a
Chopin group at her recital to-morrow.
Miss Hutchison is a small brunette
who commenced her stage career four
years ago. Her ambitions were first fired
when she joined the children’s classes of
Pianowski, Pavlova’s ballet-master. She
is the only daughter of the late W. F.
Hutchison and of Mrs. Hutchison, whose
stage-name was Lily Maddocks. Picture

Helen, elder daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
Garnet Leary, has accepted the heart
and hand of Gavin Knox Finlay, of
Violet Town, eldest son of Mr. and Mrs.
S. A. Finlay, of Seymour.
Quite the nicest kind of bridge party
is that held in a private home, particu-
larly if it’s a mansion like the A. B. Pater-
sons’ at Bedford. The Junior League of
the Women’s Hospital worked up last
week’s effort, which filled Albany-road
with cars. Tables were arranged in the
ballroom, in the dining-room, with its
outlet to a refreshingly green conserva-
tory, and in the smoking-room, where
the poker people matched their luck to a
crackling fire. Tea was served in the
dining-room, where gold candles on the
polished table picked up the colors from
an immense bowl of Iceland poppies and
a marble nymph was poised on the top
of a pale-green wave.
Mrs. Paterson’s black velvet gown ran
to silver sleeves, and a brown suede hat
kept snug the head of the hon. sec., Mrs.
E. M. Cornfoot. Among the busy com-
mittee, who ran a sales-and-raffle depot
in the lounge, was Mrs. Gordon Hope,
whose beige dress had a whim for bat-
shoulders, and whose hat was a nest of
brown leaves. From Mrs. W. Riddell’s
halo-ish hat the eye travelled downwards
in the track of pin-wheel stripes on navy
crepe. Mrs. Bob Nathan’s mink coat
left visible a few inches of lacy mesh
hose. Mrs. Jimmy Carnegie was there
in green, and a brilliant pin stabbed Mrs.
Norman Price’s black hat. Guests who
found their way to the sun-room were
rewarded with an eyeful of striped
cushions, swinging seats, chirruping
canaries and green and blue budgerigars
which live together in cages of three.
The profile by Broothorn belongs to
Dagrunn Kaaten, a Norwegian girl who
is making her first trip so far away from
home. She is the guest of the Consul
for Norway and Mrs. Lie. Miss Kaaten’s
home is in Kongsvinger, 60 miles from
Oslo, where in winter one puts on skis
at the front door, and in summer can
swim the fjord. Then cotton dresses are
a necessity, for last summer Norway was
the hottest part of Northern Europe, in-
cluding the British Isles. There’s good
fishing, particularly for salmon, and Nor-
wegians play a lot of tennis, though so
far they haven’t discovered the lure of
golf. Miss Kaaten has relatives in Vic.
and a brother in Sydney whom she hopes
to join later for a ski-ing holiday at Kos-
ciusko. Sverre Kaaten was twice ski-ing
champion of Australasia.
“Learn to keep fit and happy, and be
a credit to your country, citizens Mel-
bourne will be proud of.” Thus Lady
Huntingfield wound up her speech after
her first visit to the Y.W.C.A. In the
Connibere Hall the sports teams, having
excitedly exchanged the garments of their
daily toil for basketball tunics, exer-
cised lusty lungs with three cheers for
their patroness, and, by request, a real
coo-ee. Y.W. president Mrs. Stewart
Cowan, Miss Langley, Mrs. Peter Tait
and Mrs. Essington Lewis formed a body-
guard to conduct the v.-r. guest through
the various departments after she had
received a salute from a white-and-blue
squad of Young Citizens. The tour
ended at a meeting of the Girls’ Forward
Movement, which is an inner working of
the Blue Triangle.
As a mark of her interest, Lady Hunt-
ingfield invited to tea at G.H. a body of
representative women who will be the
nucleus of the future Blue Triangle com-
mittee.

Mephisto. glared at the dancers congregated
at the “Shop” for the Engineers’ Ball, and
realistic flames flickered around the dais, which
housed the Collegians’ orchestra. Prof. Fanen-
kel’s lady trailed weblike black lace; Mrs.
Creswell’s chiffons were moon-blue; Mercia
Hoey’s scarlet satins gleamed with silver;
Theone Couch swished a dainty contraption of
floral taffetas; Sheila Gill swayed sapling-wise
in leafy-green velvet; Biddy Dodd’s cowslip
taffetas caught the eye; and mushroom pink
gleamed skinfully ’neath Dorothy Fleming’s
black-spotted net.
Karrinyup Club massed all its rooms with
warm-toned autumn leaves for its cheery
dinner dance. President Meachem’s better half
hung red jade beads over her classic-cut
royal-blue marocains; gold tissue and brown
velvet sandals twinkled under Mrs. Freddy
Clarke’s honey velvet; Mrs. Norman Temper-
ley’s black nets rose to a lacquered cape tied
with a huge bow which caressed her ear;
Mollie Learmonth’s silvery blue brocades were
seen ushering a large party; Dick Stawell took
the opportunity of announcing his engagement
to Betty Dean, a Victorian picture in fichued
pastel blue. Betty Blackman’s silver silhouette
gleamed in the moonlight.
Women Justices gathered at the W.S.G. to
exchange greetings and welcome new members.
President Mrs. Jean Beadle thanked Mrs.
Joyner for the presentation posie, took May
Holman and the Harbor City’s Mrs. J. A.
Wilson under her wings and led the troop off
to luncheon.
Members of the 200 Club held their first
guest night at the Y.A.L. Hall, with Lash-
brooke ballets and Rene Underwood and
Reddy McMorrow Living exhibition dances.
Committeewoman Toddles Dunn gave a neat
twist to a length of violet velvet; Mrs. Hynes s
sequins lent a pool-like gleam to her murky
georgettes; Dorothy Lumb’s gold satins were
Junoesque; Betty Shann scattered largesse over
her ivory satins; Nancy Mengler’s embossed
blue velvets were lashed with silver; and Elsie
Forrest was a landmark in persimmon radio-
wave velvet.
Pilot Jimmie Woods is flying his air-minded
helpmeet to Melbourne to take shelter with
General and Mrs. Jess until the centenary air
race. Mrs. Ted Norman rallied a horde to
make farewells over a pot of tea.
A blinding fog emanated from the wings
of the Repertory Theatre during the Rep.
Soc.’s production of Galsworthy’s “Escape,”
and lingered a bit for a few of the fast-chang-
ing scenes. Jimmy Ralph carried the arduous
part of Matt Dannat, and Bill Darbyshire and
Elsie McCallum gave good support. A. J.
Bishop directed.
Rottnest Island loomed large on the walls
on Newspaper House Galleries at George
Benson’s exhibition of water-colors. Prot.
Whitfield opened the show. Fortunately there
was a dais, or he couldn’t have been seen by
the crowd. Mrs. Drake-Brockman’s grey
checks were seen near “Building the Silver
Gull”; Mrs. Margaret Johnson (who designed
the Edith Cowan Memorial) parked her stone-
martens near “The Workshop.”
Adelaide’s social doings:
A dance was given by the recently-married
Irvine Walds at their home, Unley Park, for
the debut of Mr. Wald’s young cousin, Peggy
Dale, of Sydney. Balloons gave a carnival
touch to a marquee where the host and hostess,
with Miss Dale, received the guests. Mrs.
Wald’s frock of silver lame was relieved by a
touch of pale apple-green velvet. The deb.’s
frock was of flesh-pink satin, with flat satin
roses of the same material trimming the bolero
effect. Her sister Joan was tracked in silver
lame. Mrs. Graham Wald was a handsome
figure in black ring velvet.
Over 200 students of the medical faculty, with
their friends, made merry at their dance in the
Uni. refectory. Floral decorations were
arranged by Miss Pat Richardson, assisted by
women students; a few touches typical of the
profession were added by the young men.
Medicoes and their wives came in scores. The
orchestra was garbed in long white operating
gowns.
Mrs. Ross Sawers entertained about 50 young
people at her home, Unley Park, at a dance
for her daughters Helen and Jean. Lorraine
Lee roses decorated the drawing-room and
dining-room. Mrs. Sawers was smartly gowned
in black ring velvet with diamente, and her
two daughters chose pale-blue crepe and pale-
pink romaine respectively.
A dinner dance organised by young Mrs.
Norman Birks, of Coromandel Valley, in aid
of the Blackwood District Nurses proved a
success. About 130 motored from the city.
The Acting-Mayoress (Mrs. H. Dunstan),
Mrs. Angas Johnson, Mrs. C. Dashwood and
Miss Grant Allan were conveners of a bridge
party in the Town Hall to rake in some shekels
for the Youth Occupation Committee. The
Y.A.L. women’s auxiliary attended to the supper.
Mrs. Dunstan gave the prizes for women, and
Mrs. Angas Johnson those for the men.
Roseworthy Agricultural College’s ball
brought motor-loads of the students’ friends
from the city. The orchestra played behind
sheaves of oats and wheat. In one corner stood
a waggon full of hay, and in another a small
pen held a ewe and a lamb, seeing life from
the social side.
Over 500 attended the Hackney Free Kin-
dergarten’s dance at the Embassy. Poinsettia
and autumn foliage decorated, and the small
tables round the ballroom, where supper was
served in cabaret style, were done with irises
and Iceland poppies. Mrs. Lavington Bony-
thon,' ‘president of the Kindergarten Union, wore
an amethyst marocain toilette with gold lame,
pale green outlining the decolletage. Mrs.
Herbert Solomon, Hackney’s president, chose a
smart Spanish tile lace frock, with modish
velvet shoulder cape. She presented Mrs.
Bonython with a bouquet in yellow tonings.
From the Speck:
Brighton Race Club’s winter meeting came
off in fine but icy weather, not very pleasant
for the many who made the outing a motoring
picnic. President John Swan had his two
daughters Nancy and Mollie with him, and
enthusiasts who braved the cold included the
R. C. Thompsons, the A. R. Wormans, the
Russell Ibbotts, Mr. T. Lyons and daughter
Sybil.
The T.T.C. races at Mowbray were a chilly
business, and the prevailing tone of color was
blue, worn on the nose. Among those who
backed their fancies were the A. E. Raeburns,
Mrs. Bob Hawker, the R. Fields, Mrs. Pepper,
Dr. Clemons, the C. Gunns, Mrs. Charlie
Martin, Winsme Warren, Mollie Hoskins, the
Tom Johnsons, Bonnie Thyne, the G. Mere-
diths, the F. F. Fairthornes and Mr. and Mrs.
Branison and their two girls.
Vice-royalty smiled upon the Yacht Club
Ball, Lady Clark in blue floral chiffons. Com-
modore G. H. Evans and his wife, who was
clad in black chiffon velvet and lace, received
the guests at the entrance to the Continental
ballroom, which was decorated with flags and
shaded lights. Supper tables were decked in
russet and gold.
For the Mayoress’s afternoon-tea party and
musicale at the Town Hall over 100 guests
rolled up, including the Lieut.-Gov. Autumn
flowers made a glow of gold and red about
the room.
When the R. M. Gunns moved into their
new home, Forton, near Epping, a number of
their friends gave them a house-warming in the
shape of a dance. Huge fires kept Jack Frost
at ' bay, and the dancers and bridge players
spent a cheery evening.
The Banks-Smith sisters Milly and Leila have
let their house in Adelaide-street and gone
to live with their sister, Mrs. Jeanneret, at
Hunter’s Hill, Sydney. Farewell parties made
their last days in Hobart busy.
Mary Johnson, of Launceston, is off to
Berlin to marry Lieut. Curt Wennburgh, A.D.C.
to Prince Carl of Sweden.
Sheila, only girl chick of the David Head-
lams, Bellerive, and Robert Blagdon Hale, New
Norfolk, have announced their engagement.

BRIDGE WITHOUT SIGHS.
BY Dr. H. L. TONKIN.
SYSTEM V. “COMMONSENSE.”
Storms seem imminent in the bridge
world, and quite possibly there will be
a split in the Anglo-American camp. One
party, led by the downright Colonel
Buller, waves the Union Jack and cries
“Play British bridge!” Another leans
more to the parent of contract bridge,
French Plafond, saying that it is not
tied up by so many conventions, and
that the player’s own personality and
individuality go for more. This may be
so, but, after all, the great goal in con-
tract is accuracy in both bidding and play.
The American attempts to standardise
bidding are directed to this end.
One may hear complaints that contract
is no longer a game but an examination
on your knowledge of this or that sys-
tem. “Systems! To hell with systems!”
cries Colonel Buller; “let’s have com-
monsense ; play British bridge! ” Which
implies that commonsense is lacking in
American systems, particularly that of
his old opponent, Mr. Eli Culbertson.
Nevertheless, in Australia, as in most
bridge-playing countries, the Culbertson
system is by far the most popular. It
would almost seem that in contract
bridge, as in the more important affairs
of life, the national temperament rules
Britons. Profound concentration and
intensive training ' repel them. But
“muddling through” won’t do in a game
where the greatest accuracy is demanded
to achieve the best results.
I have no brief for what Colonel
Buller calls “American bridge.” I would
only like to see Englishmen throw aside
all prejudices and graft their excellent
card-playing instinct on to the best
features of the Culbertson system. Eli
Culbertson has done far more than in-
troduce the forcing two-bid and the
forcing response. His studies of hand
patterns, and consequent classification
of hands playable in n.t. and those more
fitted for suit bids, have improved bid-
ding much more than either of those en-
gaging toys. Even before the advent of
contract, Culbertson vigorously spon-
sored the bidding of four-card suits,
major or minor, when it was considered
rank heresy by other bridge pundits.
There is still in England a third party,
which plays contract according to the
Culbertson system. Colonel Buller de-
plores its existence, and cheerily records
its defeats in duplicate matches.
But it seems ridiculous to continue
reviling English exponents of the
system while the Americans keep on
beating British teams. Culbertson is a
showman, but has something to sell. In
his Blue Book he produced a volume on
cards far superior to all the efforts of
other masters. Admittedly it is not all
the result of original investigation, but
its appeal for the better player lies in
the fact that it sharply defines ideas which
may have been hazily seen by him for
years.
However, I’m not here to boom Cul-
bertson. What I want to know is what
Colonel Buller offers in exchange. “Use
commonsense,” he says. Very well, but
suppose my particular brand of common-
sense does not correspond to yours when
we are partnered. You may not believe
in waiting for three quick tricks for a
vulnerable bid. Two are enough, and you
open the ball brightly. I credit you
with three and bid on till we are doubled
and set for a big penalty. I may look
at you in very hurt fashion, but am I
justified in crediting you with, lack of
commonsense? If so, you are in good
company. Mr. Hal Sims often opens on
two q.t. if he holds what he terms the
attacking type of hand.
It boils down to this. In contract, far
more than in auction, accuracy is the
essential. A player must have information
which will enable him to try to visual-
ise his partner’s hand. It is impossible,
of course, to do this with absolute pre-
cision, but you must be able to calculate
that on the average when your partner
makes an opening bid his hand contains
24 defensive tricks and about four play-
ing tricks. All other bids, responses and
doubles are founded on this.
Colonel Buller slates the forcing two-
bid. It is very seldom used among good
players, mainly because, although the 54
h.t. may be there, the actual playing tricks
are absent. I agree that no player should
be the slave of any system of bidding.
But to say that the Culbertson system is
fit only for beginners is rubbish.
If conventions and artificialities are
anathema, Mr. Vanderbilt is far more
guilty than Mr. Culbertson. On very
strong hands Mr. Vanderbilt prescribes
the bid of one club, possibly without a
single club in the hand, and the response
of one diamond may be given with a
void in that suit.
It’s not the actual bidding system bear-
ing Culbertson’s name which has branded
him guilty of bridge felony ; it’s the fact
that he has commercialised the game to
an extent undreamt of by his predeces-
sors. His textbooks, his magazine, his
staff of certified teachers in various coun-
tries, must bring him in an enormous
annual income.
I, for one, say good luck to the man
who not only was able to analyse the
game and introduce such improvements
for all standards of players, but could
see the commercial possibilities in it.
Let us now look over one or two
hands played in a big London dupli-
cate match. These examples will show
the same hand bid in two different rooms
by two different methods:
4—9, 7,4, 2
V—lo
10, 9,7, 5,4, 2
4— Q, 10, 3 N 4— A, K, J, 6

4—B, 3
V—9, 8,6, 4
4—\, J, 6, 3
4, 2
In Room 1 East bid one spade and
West went immediately to four spades,
which closed the bidding. Thirteen tricks
were made, as the diamond was not led.
The West player, with his powerful hold-
ing, was quite right to bid the game. He
felt sure that it should be made, and
knew that if he called two clubs or three
clubs, or even two hearts, his partner
might be justified in dropping the bid-
ding. In this case, East would undoubt-
edly have gone on, but the point is that
West cannot possibly know it, so he has
nous enough to “go for the gloves.”
In Room 2 West is on the box-seat.
He also knows that a game should be
made. There may be more in it, so he
can afford to go quietly. Under the
system, he answers East’s one spade with
three clubs. East is not allowed to pass.
If his one spade has been bid on a mini-
mum he must reply three n.t. As it is,
he is in a position to visualise West’s
hand fairly accurately. At the worst
there should be no more than one loser
between them, so he bids six clubs.
As in Room 1,13 tricks were obtained.
The British players who held these hands
in Room 1 are not to blame for bidding
as they did. They arrived at the best bid
with the methods at their disposal.
Here is another hand which does noth-
thing to glorify any system, but sadly
demonstrates a minimum of common-
sense on the part of the players who
relied on that faculty. As a matter of
fact, it also shows up some utterly futile
bidding by the American team. With the
information given him by West’s first and
second bid the American East is hardly
justified in bidding more than four spades.

You will notice that the bidding is iden-
tical in both rooms up to West’s two
n.t. response to East’s forcing take-out.
Then the best that can be said for East’s
three n.t. bid is that either it was a slip
of the tongue or that the player was
mentally tired after a hard day’s play.
Undoubtedly the hand demands being
bid to game in whichever major suit is
the better fit.
In Room 2, after arriving at the correct
game bid, East was seized by the spirit
of adventure and decided that, although
West had given a minimum answer of
two n.t. to the force, he might still be
goaded into a slam. West (Culbertson
himself) nobly replied with six spades.
It so happens that West’s hand is one
of the few excellent fits which permits
the spade slam to be easily got.
This second example, I think, demon-
strates the fact that system and common-
sense may both go to the wall when
some characteristic of the player is in
the ascendant and temporarily rules the
game.

Dental science
answers the ques-
tion of what leads
to toothache by
saying that food
particles have been
permitted to re-
main between the
teeth and under the gums, to decay.
Germs, or bacteria, formed in and by
this decaying food, make acids which
attack the cement-like structure of the
teeth and dissolve out the material
between the enamel rods.
The germs that cause the decay-pro
ducing acids have a friend in the film
coat, or mucin-plaque, which forms on
teeth. This film glues the bacteria to
the teeth, providing a sort of warm
shelter for them and even supplies them
with food to thrive on.
Removal of film has therefore become
an important problem for dental science.
One of the most notable discoveries in this
field was made recently in the laboratories
of the Pepsodent Company when a new
and revolutionary cleansing material was
developed. The cleansing and polishing
material is the part of any toothpaste that

USE PEPSODENT TWICE A DAY—SEE YOUR DENTIST TWICE A YEAR
Cooney and Culture.
BY W. E. FITZ HENRY.
I FIRST met Lloyd Cooney when I
was covering suburban police courts
for the “Splash.” Twice a week I
used to go to Boronia and chronicle
drunk-and-disorderly cases and the dis-
putes of slatterns. It was ragtag and
bobtail work, but that’s what junior
reporters are for.
Kicking my heels in the vestibule of
the grimy brick court, 1 tossed a half-
smoked Capstan on the well-scrubbed
tiled floor. An angry shout assailed me.
“What the blazes are you doin’?
This ain’t a pigsty!”
It was Constable Mullins, an enemy
since the day he caught me in the act
of borrowing depositions from the
court files.
“Hullo,” I ventured lamely. “What’s
wrong?”
“What’s wrong! ” he roared back.
“You know you can’t throw bumpers
on the floor.”
“Well!” 1 muttered with assumed in-
difference.
“'well, he replied, “it’ll cost you ten
bob.”
What do you mean?”
“We’re giving Sergeant Casey a fare-
well party. Tickets are ten bob each,
and you’re buying one now.”
“Wrong! If .1 go to Casey’s send-
off, I go on a press-ticket.”
“It’s you that’s wrong. I see by the
bulge of that overcoat pocket you’re still
helping yourself to our stationery. I
could make it”
“Ten bob, I think you said?”
“Ten bob,” said Constable Mullins.
Casey’s party was held at a hall be-
longing to the Oddfellows, the Recha-
bites or the Hibernians —I forget which.
Now that I recall the accents of most of
the Boronia policemen, it must have
been the Hibernians.
The place was packed with con-
stables, looking uncomfortable in mufti,
and with detectives in their invariable
blue-serge suits, peering from side to
side in their suspicious way. There was
also an inspector, who seemed to be
wearing corsets, and there were a few
of the heads from the city. Local
starting-price bookies, sly-grog sellers,
tin-hare urgers and two-up scouts were
among those present. Constable Mullins
had doubtless rounded them up.
A red-haired copper began the enter-
tainment with a husky rendering of
“Mother Machree.” The corseted in-
spector followed with “Gunga Din” and
“Bill ’Awkins.” One of the heads per-
formed tricks with cards, and volunteered
to give an encore with billiard-balls and
a table if anyone had remembered to
bring them. No one had.
Glancing at my programme (“pre-
sented by Patrick Kelly, of the Sports-
men’s Arms”), I saw that the fourth
number was to be “Yarns, Not Yawns,”
by Lloyd Cooney. Mr. Cooney proved
to be a tall fellow with a ridiculously
small and solemn face. He was in a
dinner suit, very much the worse for
wear, and those in the first row caught
an odor of mothballs, rum and onions.
He began his turn with a limerick
about a bishop. I expected him to be
arrested on the ‘spot. He was wildly
cheered. He proceeded to relate classics
which circulate freely in hairdressing
saloons and “pastime” clubs. They
each struck a responsive chord in the
breast of every policeman present. I
felt 1 had lived to see a miracle.
At the end of the entertainment I
was introduced to Cooney, and was per-
mitted to pay his tram-fare back to
town.
When he learned that I was on the
“Splash” he remarked: “My boy, I enjoy
making contacts with the press. You
and I shall see a lot of each other.”
We parted on brotherly terms, after
going the round of the lesser clubs. We
began at the Paperstainers’ and ended
at the Beetlecrushers’ —or perhaps it
was the other way about.
Promoted from police courts to the
vegetable and fish markets, with a com-
mission to give casual help on the Stage
and Screen page, I was able to be of
some service to Cooney. One week he
would be billed to appear at a suburban
picture-show. The next he might give
a Dickens recital at an old men’s
home. The week following he would be
singing on the sands. At Christmas
time he would do Santa Claus for one
of the department stores ; at Easter he
would be in a side-show at the Agricul-
tural Ground. Whatever he did, and
wherever he was, I recorded the fact
in the “Splash.”
My booming of Cooney ended when
one of the largest theatrical advertisers
complained that Cooney was getting more
space in the “Splash” than all the per-
formers on their circuit. A gross ex-
aggeration, of course, but it caused the
advertising manager to send a sarcastic
note to the editor. The chief of staff
sent for me.
“There is a vacancy on the Newcastle
staff,” he said. “Fill it or get out.”
At Newcastle for three years, I lost
track of Cooney, whose name appeared
no more in the “Splash.” At the end
of the three years I could call, four
Labor leaders by their Christian names
and had been given a black eye by a
football-club secretary. Depresh arrived.
Economies were effected at headquarters.
Seniors were put off—they cost too
much. I was recalled to Sydney and
made assistant to the Competition
Editor and the Dramatic Critic.
“We want an article on Poverty
Point,” the Dramatic Critic said. “You
collect the material and I’ll write it.”
At the Criterion corner, where actors
and actresses assembled every Monday
morning, hoping for engagements, I met
Cooney again. Depresh had affected
his appearance but riot his spirits.
“It’s the little fellow from the ‘Splash,’ ”
he boomed. “Laddie, I am pleased to
see you. And I could sink a schooner.”
I had ordered the second before 1 had
time to ask him how he was getting on.
“Not so good, my boy ; not so good.
Just tea and toast now and then,” he
answered.
I signalled the barmaid for the third
round.
“Last week,” he went on, “I got my
first break for a month. Birthday party
at Waverton. Five bob, two ginger
beers and a lot of blasted chocolate
cakes. To think that Lloyd Cooney, the
greatest”
“Look here, pal,” I interrupted.
“You’re going about things the wrong
way. You’ll never get on by barn-
storming around the suburbs. You’ve
got to get among the starched shirts.
Among the cultured class.”
“How is it to be done?”
“Easy. Start a repertory society. Two
guineas a head sub. and five, three
and two. Give ’em highbrow drama.
Ibsen, Shaw, O’Neill, Russian plays,
German plays, Spanish plays—any damn
play that gives the man in the street a
headache. I know the ropes. I’ll plan
everything for you.”
“It’s no use, laddie. I’m a comedian,
and the only thing I know about these
highbrow dramas is that there’s nothing
comic in ’em.”
“Isn’t there? You’ve never been to
a repertory show!”
Cooney offered a dozen more objec-
tions, but I carried the day.
Enter the Torch Theatre. We estab-
lished it by means of the t.-p. system
and credit from printers, electricians and
others. It was housed in portion of
the second floor of a ramshackle build-
ing in a laneway near Circular Quay.
Eastern and North Shore suburbs, whose
vanity we had tickled with circulars,
supported it with guineas. The actors
were recruited from among the intelli-
gentsia of King’s Cross ; the stage crafts-
men were mechanics with a hankering
for culture.
The letterheads, printed on buff-
colored antique paper—never paid for
—carried the line LLOYD COONEY,
DIRECTOR, in bold type. Photographs
of Cooney appeared in weeklies and
monthlies. On Sunday evenings he lec-
tured on the mission of the Torch
Theatre—to women for the most part.
Stage-struck girls, their sisters and their
mas.
Under my guidance Cooney began
with a safe drawing-room play. It re-
ceived brief and guarded praise from
the critics on the “Gurgle” and the
“Splurge” and a rhapsodical column in
the “Splash.” He then presented a
season of plays by demented Czechs,
atheistic Italians, gloomy Slavs and un-
intelligible Teutons. Each met with in-
creasing appreciation, though no two
members of any audience agreed as to
what each play meant.
Guineas rolled in. Cooney borrowed
sixteen to buy a suit of clothes. The
Torch Theatre had been accepted as a
cultural pilot.
“Laddie,” said Cooney, “we’re home
and dry.”
“Home on the pig’s back,” I replied.
But we were to learn better.
Duty called me away from Sydney.
The “Splash” had started a Most Beauti-

Two Profit Thermometers
The readings of these two thermometers for the
years 1929 and 1933 indicate the severity of the
depression. ,
One shows the profits earned by the trading banks
on their shareholders' funds and'the other the
profits of a representative list of 177 public com-
panies covering practically every type of business
activity.
In 1929 the companies earned 8.2%, the banks
7.8%. By 1933 the companies' profits had fallen
to 4.1% and those of the banks to under 2.9%.
Two facts stand out clearly from these figures:—
(1) Bank profits are lower than business profits;
(2) Bank profits fell more than business profits.
Bank profits, like business profits, reflect all
changes in the prosperity of the people.
The banks do not welcome a business depression
any more than the people welcome adversity.
The banks support the community to the limit of
their resources in times of stress and, in co-opera-
tion with governments and producers of all kinds,
make every effort to hasten economic recovery.

ful Milkmaid competition, and I spent
a couple of dreadful months trudging
through the mud of cow-ranches accom-
panied by a photographer.
I returned to find Cooney depressed.
The Torch was almost extinguished.
Subscriptions were no longer coming in.
Attendances were pitiful. The actors had
grown stale and there were rumors of
secession.
The “Gurgle’* and the “Splurge” were
not as guarded as they had been. The
“Splash” had become brutal.
“What sort of a fool game have you
run me into?” growled Cooney. “Every-
thing’s gone flat. Have a screw at the
bills! ” and he thrust a pile of the offend-
ing documents under my nose.
I answered him with patience, for-
bearing to mention that without me to
guide him he was a ship without a
rudder.
“Times are bad,” I said. “It’s just after
Easter. People have spent all their
money. Under such conditions one
does not sit down and moan. One chases
business. Plan a publicity campaign.
Get some new actors. Give your audi-
ences a gripping play that hasn’t been
done here before.”
“Play, you say?” said Cooney, begin-
ning to look cheerful again. “I’ve got
the very thing.”
He fumbled in a drawer of his desk
and brought forth a faded script.
“Here it is,” he said, tapping the outer
sheet with his forefinger. “Never been
known to fail to pull ’em in. I’ll make
it our next bill.”
It was a melodrama that would have
warmed the heart of Bland Holt,
“Betrayed, But Pure.” It related the
misfortunes of an elderly farmer and
his beautiful daughter. Wronged by a
wretch from the city, she has a harrow-
ing time until John Goodfellow puts
things right in the fifth act (you got your
money’s worth in Holt’s days). The
forged will, the stolen receipt and the
baby in the basket were all there.
“Cooney,” I said, “it is madness to
present such mullock to an intellectual
audience.”
“Nothing but ‘Betrayed, But Pure,’
will save us,” he insisted.
We argued about it warmly and
arrived at a compromise. “Betrayed, But
Pure,” should be produced, but in
another guise. I was to make the altera-
tions.
I renamed it “Strife on the Steppes.”
I attributed the authorship to Gregoro-
vitch Balashovski, placed the action near
Pavlovsk and changed the names of all
the characters. Vodka I substituted for
beer, a samovar for a teapot and an
ikon for an oleograph of Queen Vic-
toria. Jasper Craven, the villain,
became an O.G.P.U. agent; Good-
fellow, a Kulak; Mary, the daughter, a
factory employee strongly in favor of
birth-control. Her dear old father I
changed into a drunken droshky-driver.
The plot was adapted to the changed
characters. Liberal borrowings from
Gorky, Dostoevsky and Tolstoy and
speeches by Lenin and Trotsky were
introduced into the dialogue.
With something of the pride of author-
ship, I handed the result to Cooney.
“Damn it, man! ” he said when he had
l'ead it, “you’ve spoilt my mascot.”
“Not at all,” I replied, ruffled ; “it may
seem a bit woozy, but that’s because I
had to have it translated into Russian
first and translated back into English to
get the right atmosphere.”
While rehearsals were in progress
Cooney vanished. It was darkly rumored
that he had been seen drinking metho.
and lemonade. We carried on during his
absence, and made all arrangements for
the opening night of “Strife on the
Steppes.”
About an hour before the curtain went
up Cooney came back, looking his old
cheerful self, and eager to take over
again.
“You worked a schlenter on me,
laddie,” he said, grinning at me in the
wings, “but you’re forgiven. Let’s hope
it’s what the ruddy highbrows want.”
I still think “Strife on the Steppes” a
good play, better than anything Shaw or
O’Neill ever wrote. Unfortunately I am
unable to produce anybody to support my
contention, for no one has seen the whole
of it produced. It never got beyond the
opening act on the evening of its first and
last presentation.
For that calamity I must blame
Cooney, the box-office girl, Constable
Blay and certain unknown Communists.
I blame Cooney for his failure to con-
vince the Chief Secretary’s Department
that the Torch was not a theatre within
the meaning of the Theatres and Public
Halls Act (1908).
I blame the girl in the box-office for
selling two tickets to Constable Blay, thus
aiding him to establish that the perform-
ance was “open to the public,’' and was
not a private function, as our counsel
maintained in the subsequent legal pro-
ceedings. She should have been able to
detect a policeman, even if he was in a
starched shirt and swallow-tails and had
brought a blonde.
I blame Constable Blay for announcing
in a loud, clear voice at the end of the
first act that he was a police officer, and
that the theatre was being conducted con-
trary to the law. Had he possessed any
reverence for intellectual drama he would
have waited till it was all over.
Most of all I blame the Communists,
who had undoubtedly been attracted to
the place by the title “Strife on the
Steppes.” I blame them for stupidly
twisting Constable Blay’s' remark about
the lack of a license into an attack upon
Communism. Nothing, I am sure, was
further from Constable Blay’s thoughts.
I blame them for the bottle (empty) that
felled the representative of the law, and
for the smashing of the electric-light
globes, which plunged the house in semi-
darkness. I blame them for the panic
and the abandonment of the play.
I behaved, as I thought at the moment,
with presence of mind. Believing that
music might quell the melee, I rushed to
a gramophone in the wings, picked up a
record from a pile on a chair, and set it
going. It had been made by a band
beefing out U.S. Civil War ditties,
and the music of “Maryland, My
Maryland,” burst upon the air. It failed
to stay the rush to the entrance, but
made a definite impression on certain of
the fleeing audience.
By an unfortunate coincidence it was
the first of May. Next day the “Gurgle,”
the “Splurge” and, sad to say, the
“Splash” published long and inaccurate
stories of the trifling occurrence. The
“Splurge” came out with headlines:
MAY DAY RIOT.
COMMUNISTS ATTACK POLICE.
RUSSIAN PLAY IN CITY HALL.
“RED FLAG” SUNG.
I was puzzled about the reference to
“The Red Flag” until a friend pointed
out that “Maryland, My Maryland,” has
the same tune.
All the right-thinking newspapers called
upon the Government to declare the
Torch Theatre an illegal organisation.
Cooney came in for special denunciation.
It was suggested that he should be de-
ported.
I don’t think he was deported, but I
haven’t seen him since.
Whips.
I have seen them come, the huge gaunt gods,
Shambling through the twilight with dusk in
their shaggy hair.
Yea, I have seen them, the huge cruel gods
Whose lust will not be thwarted for any
mortal’s prayer:
Seen laughter like a scar upon their brute
thick lips,
Flinched away in terror from the agony of
their whips—•'
The lash of love, the whip of youth, the
thong of long despair.

The Street Artist.
All day he toiled in some dull street,
And dreamed his visions true,
Where high stone walls their shadows cast.
Heedless of all the crowd that passed,
And paused, and passed anew.
In beauty his own hands had made
He lived from day to day;
’Mid scarlet flowers and skies of blue
And shadowed slopes, he never knew
The world around was grey.
•Through valleys green the cool streams ran,
Deep-fringed with fern and flower,
Through green-haired willows bending low;
And white birds wheeled to skies aglow,
In sunset’s burning hour.
And some, before the pictured hills,
Stood still, remembering
The mountains, longed-for all their days,
Who, fettered fast by city ways,
Might only dream of spring;
But still recalled, with longing pain,
The song of mountain rills,
When grey mists drift and upward curl,
And morning walks in rose and pearl
Among the shining hills.
And others, who had never seen
The splendid morning rise
On dewy slopes and valleys dim
And forests green, gave thanks to Him
Who spread before their eyes
A beauty they had never seen,
Perchance might never see:
The morn on shining woodland ways,
The valleys dim in noonday’s haze,
And night’s tranquillity.

LANDTAKERS
“Growing up,” the author says, when intro-
ducing his leading character, “in a period when
Australians had begun to feel in themselves
the germ of a new people and to fumble for
words to express themselves, I often wondered
what roots that new psyche was coming from.
Then it struck me that the answer was some-
where in the life of this old man and his
generation. If I could piece together the picture
of that epoch as I had inherited it from him—
the savage deeds, the crude life, the hatred
between men and men and men and country,
the homesickness, the loneliness, the despair
of inescapable exile in the bush; the strange
forms of'madness and cruelty; the brooding,
inturned characters; and, joined with this, an
almost fanatic idealism which repudiated the
past and the tyranny of the past and looked
to the future in a new country for a new
heaven and earth, a new justice; on the one
hand the social outcasts, men broken by de-
gradation and suffering, on the other the adven-
turers: blackest pessimism balancing the most
radiant optimism—if I could only see all this,
then I would understand.”
This Year’s Most Powerful and Compelling
AUSTRALIAN NOVEL
Brian Penton, one of Australia’s best-
known feature-writers and a journalist of
international repute, has written something
entirely new in Australian literature-
something different. In “Landtakers,” the
author sets himself the big theme of
tracing up from its roots that hitherto
elusive thing, the Australian national
character.
“Landtakers” grips the imagination from
the very first page. Its literary quality is
maintained throughout—beautiful prose
is characteristic of the book, no matter
what scene or mood is being portrayed.
In fierce or violent action and in gentle
passages the language is always appro-
priate and never ceases to reflect true
literary craftsmanship.
This brilliant .novel deals with the tyranny
of the past and the hope of the future.
It takes a man whose character is sensi-
tive to environment, an Englishman who
hates this new country, and who fights
irritably against its gradual possessing
hold. Here is Australian tradition in the
making, a graphic description of what the
country had the power to do to those
from whom we have sprung. “Land-
takers” is the outstanding novel of the
year—it will be talked about, written
about and argued about. Lodge your
order now with your nearest bookseller,
and thus be sure of owning a first
edition copy.
“LANDTAKERS,” by Brian Penton. A novel of 500 pages, on sale
at all booksellers after July 2, 1934. Price 7/6 (postage 6d. extra).

Water.
BY E. DITHMACK.
WATER was so scarce that the daily
procession to the one well began
at dawn. Carts —horse-drawn,
goat-drawn and human-drawn —filed
along the road. The white, powdery dust
was well over ankle-deep. It rose like
an unceasing mist all day long, until, at
dusk, the pump was locked for the night.
“As I’m up so early,” thought Paddy
Maguire, “I’d better harness Maureen
and get away.”
He found the old mare picking in
patient apathy at the dried-up tufts of
grass around a clump of prickly-pear
bushes. She submitted dejectedly to the
halter Paddy fastened round her neck,
and stumbled after him to the yard.
“Shure and it’s Falix O’Shea I’ll be
afther beating to the well this morning,”
Paddy thought triumphantly as he
fumbled with the harness. “Ivery time
he goes he makes a boast that he’s away
the first; but not to-day, Mr. O’Shea —
not to-day.”
The bony old mare stood listlessly with
down-hanging head while her master
adjusted hames and traces. The sky was
flushed with a faint glow that beautified
even the clumps of grey prickly-pear and
the ribbon of dusty road. Soon every-
thing would be hard and white under the
pitiless sun.
Paddy got in the cart, flicked the reins,
and drove over to Richard Mason’s
house tp ask for the loan of his hundred-
gallon tank. Not that Paddy couldn’t
afford a tank for himself, but he was
like that. It might rain to-morrow, why,
or next week, and he be left with a tank
on his hands! Not many people round
about owned a tank, but most of them
owned boys, who in turn owned billy-
goats, so that it was an easy matter to
harness up each morning and get off to
the well and fill a couple of kerosene-
tins.
Dick Mason helped Paddy to load the
tank.
“You’re beaten this morning, Paddy,”
he called. “Felix O’Shea went out about
ten minutes ago.”
“Phwat! Ye don’t tell me the ould
divil’s there before me again?”
“Looks like it. Take care of that tank
now, or it’ll be costing you a new one.”
“Shure, and I’d pay it twice over to
beat O’Shea! Gid ep there, Maureen—
gid ep.”
Paddy set off along the road at a jog-
trot. Already other carts were coming
from different directions. Soon there
would be a procession of them, and dust
would fill the air, cover the bushes and
drift into the houses.
Everything about the morning was
harsh. Not a note of softness anywhere.
As Paddy passed the slaughter-yards, the
crows rose up in a mass, making the air
hideous with their cawing. Cicadas had
already commenced their shrilling.
Paddy was unaffected by it all. He
jogged along in his cart, puffing at his
pipe, Maureen’s hoofs churning the
powdery dust. She must have been
young once to have such a name ; but
old age had got into her bones —that and
the drought.
A queue of carts was at the pump
when Paddy got there, waiting for the
council employee to come with the key.
“They must get up at midnight,” he mut-
tered.
He drew Maureen into the line and
heard Felix O’Shea boasting.
“Did ye go to bed at all, Falix?” Paddy
asked with sarcasm.
“I did, Paddy. But I was up at four
o’clock, mind ye. I sez to meself, ‘l’ll
give a quid to the man that’ll get away
before me this morning,’ and the bet
still holds good.”
“Phwat?” Paddy’s yellow, old teeth
champed at his bottom lip. “Is that the
way ye go boasting, Falix O’Shea? I’ll
be afther taking ye on thin. Here’s one
that won’t sit and listen to the skiteful-
ness of ye.”
“Hm!” Felix snorted contemptuously.
“And it’s afther filling me tank and on
the way home I’ll be before ye’ve even a
dhrop in yours,” he concluded.
“Talk, just talk,” Felix retorted dis-
dainfully.
“Is the quid safe?”
“Course it’s safe.” Felix held up a
pound note and returned it to his pocket.
“Right! Here, gid ep, Maureen!”
On the opposite side of the creek there
were Chinese market gardens. A crude
pump was kept working day and night
by blindfolded horses going round and
round at the end of a long pole. As
water was drawn up it ran along gut-
tering into little 4ft. wells, placed at inter-
vals of a hundred yards or so.
Already the Chinese were at work, their
long pigtails flip-flapping as they trotted
along. A watering-can fastened to each
end of a bamboo pole was carried across
their shoulders ; it watered each side of
the path as they moved. Here was water
indeed!
Up and down they trotted, stepping
into the wells to refill their cans, their
dirty calico shorts dripping round their
bare legs. They looked like busy yellow
dwarfs. Everything was peaceful here:
nothing but the creaking of the pole as
the horses plodded round and the crisp
sound of the water as it was tipped into
the guttering broke the silence. That,
and, of course, the cicadas ; but one grew
so used to their shrilling that it became
part of the silence.
Paddy headed Maureen towards the
bank of the creek. It was steep and
dangerous. No one had attempted to
take a horse and cart down there before,
but was ever man so aggravated?
Several of the waiting farmers, divin-
ing Paddy’s intention, and anxious to
see Felix defeated, helped in heading
Maureen down the bank. With some
holding her up in the shafts and others
hanging on to the cart behind, they man-
aged to jolt and rattle to the bottom of
the creek. She paused for a blow ; then,
with much urging, she faced the climb
up the other side. Paddy pulled and the
men all pushed; so that when they
reached the top they all wanted a blow.
At the entrance to the gardens, three
or four fierce dogs were chained up.
Paddy kept a wary eye on the animals,
straining at their chains, and drove
through the wide entrance.
A smiling Celestial came trotting to-
wards the men, his wide-brimmed, cone-
shaped hat sitting firmly above the
dangling plaits.
“Here, John,” Paddy said ; “me givum
you two shillun you letum me fill up
tank.”
John shook his head emphatically, still
smiling blandly. “Wellee sollee,” he said.
“No givum water here. Cabbagee die,
lettucee die.”
“Now, look here, John,” one of the men
urged. “You givum Paddy water to-day.
he pay you two, three, shillun. Allee
same cabbagee die then.”
“No, no. Wellee sollee.” John stili
smiled benignly, though he was adamant,
knowing that once the rule was broken
he would be at everyone’s mercy.
“To hell wid ye then!” Paddy’s patience
was exhausted. “Here, Bill, we’ll fill up,
and ye other fellows stop the Chinks
getting out the dogs.”
Paddy took charge now. He seized
two cans from a second Celestial who
came trotting along, also smiling, and
began to fill the tank.
The Chinese no longer smiled. They
drew away and held a council of war with
a third, who came up at a call.
Paddy worked at top speed, trying to
keep one eye on the water and one on
the owners.
So far, all was well at the pump. The
men were still waiting, and new arrivals
began to stroll over to see how things
were faring.
The tank was half-full when the
Chinamen returned at the double with
their hoes. Paddy and his supporters
made a barricade of the cart and opened
fire with cabbages and turnips. A melon
or two, aimed with precision, caused a
retreat on the part of the attackers, who
turned and ran across an acre of
ploughed ground to a hut where there
were more Chinese.
“We’ll have to go like fire,” said
Paddy, “before they bring up reinforce-
ments.”
Tired of watching proceedings from
the pump, O’Shea had decided to investi-
gate at closer quarters. He stood out-
side the fence, the thought of his vanish-
ing pound filling him with rage.
“A low-down thafe, I call ye!” he
spluttered. “Look at the garden—just
look at the ruination all round.”
“And look at y’r pound being won!”
Paddy jeered. “ ’Tis first I’ll be away
this morning, Mr. O’Shea!”
“Ye’ve to get across the creek,” O’Shea
taunted, “and that’s no easy matter.”
“Wid all me helpers, Falix, ’tis but a
bit of fun.”

RELIEF IN 24 HOURS
No more “too-old,” worn-out feeling. You join with the youngest
in all the pleasures of life. In 24 hours you will see the action of
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills, and know how quickly they have
reached the seat of your trouble —the kidneys. Why stop in pain and
weakness, when here is health for the asking? Let this safe, sure
remedy bring you health now. Refuse all substitutes—there is nothing
just as good as De Witt’s Pills. Sold only in the blue, white and gold
boxes, price 3/6, or the larger, more economical size, 6/6. In your
own interest you should see that the name of the manufacturers,
E. C. De Witt & Co. (Ausv.) Pty. Ltd., is clearly printed on the box.
Pain —awful pain—constant pain—
nerve-irritating pain all day, and all
night, too. Yes, the martyr to chronic
backache soon begins to know what the
word “ pain ” means.
Why do you let Backache, Lumbago,
Joint Pains, Rheumatism, Sciatica, ruin
your health and make you a misery to
yourself and all around you.
Many people say “ Oh! I must have caught cold,” or “ I
must have been sitting in a draught. My back feels like
breaking. . . That dull, down-dragging weakness in the
back makes me feel exhausted... Pains in the muscles—
I just can’t get on with my work.”
WEAK KIDNEYS CAUSE UNTOLD AGONIES
This splendid remedy, through the kid-
neys, expels the poisons such as uric acid
in excess and other impurities that are the
cause of your suffering. These are not
“cure-all” pills. They are prepared to
tone up the kidneys and give you back
your strength and vigour.
Actually it is kidney weakness that is the
cause of the down-dragging weariness and
constant pain you suffer. If weak kidneys
are sapping your strength, causing body
pains, rheumatic twinges, bladder trouble,
you cannot possibly do better than start at
once with De Witt’s Pills.

“If I lose the pound ’tis something I’ll
have for it,” Felix retorted. He began
filling his pockets and shirt with the
vegetables lying about until he bulged
like a balloon.
“ ’Tis the perlice that should be afther
ye,” he threatened, “and evidence
wouldn’t be lacking wid Falix O’Shea
about! Thaves and robbers —that’s all
ye are.”
The sun was well up now, the morning
hot. Felix grabbed a big split water-
melon and sat down to quench his thirst
and appease his wrath.
“Look out!” someone called warn-
ingly.
The Chinamen came across the pad-
dock as Paddy backed his cart and got
away. Felix sat calmly with his back to
the approaching fury, smacking his lips
and burrowing into the melon.
Paddy, out of the gardens now and
safe, thought fit to give his enemy timely
warning.
Felix glanced round, saw the approach-
ing army, and ran, his gaping mouth full
of dripping melon.
“Come on, carn’t y’!” his son shouted
outside the fence. “Bettin’ quids and
then losing them! What are y’ thinking
about?”
But Felix, scrambling under the wire,
was too spent for words. All he could
do was to shake a trembling fist in the
face of his son and regain his breath
painfully while getting back to the pump.
Paddy felt worried as he guided
Maureen down the bank of the creek,
with the men acting as a brake. His
shouted “Whoas!” had little effect on
Maureen. Urged on by the tank and
checked by the men, she was but the
tool of circumstance. They reached the
bottom with a rush, and, rather shaken,
sat down to have a minute’s rest.
“Now, thin.” Paddy patted Maureen,
knowing what was ahead, and spoke en-
couragingly. The men waited behind,
ready to push.
Maureen eyed the bank speculatively,
took a few tentative steps and stopped.
She sat back on the cart. The cart sat
back on the men. Slowly they all re-
treated to the bottom.
“Now, come on, Maureen, me pet!”
Paddy urged. “Just a bit of a pull and,
shure, we’ll be there.” He took a
firmer hold of the reins while the men
got ready again. “Now, thin!” he called,
fresh authority in his voice. “Ep, girl!
Ep!”
But Maureen had long forgotten her
girlhood. She remembered only that she
was a broken-down old crock, and past
such foolishness. Pushed on from
behind, she made a half-hearted effort,
then relaxed her heaving sides with a
big sigh and rested. So did the cart,
So did the men—when they got to the
bottom,
Bill Powers lost his temper. “She’s
nothing but a damned old jibber!” he
said wrathfully. “Here, let me try, Pat.”
Paddy relinquished authority, while
the men at the back and wheels got
ready again,
“Now, then,” Bill Powers bullied, “git
ep, there, you old loafer! Git ep!”
He beat her with the reins while Paddy
pushed her rump. They made better
progress this time; but half-way up
Maureen gave up the fight and refused
to budge another step.
Bill swore and tugged and called her
names. Maureen was deaf to insults,
The cart, the horse and the men retreated
to the bottom once more,
Bill Powers scratched his head and
thought. “Take her out, Pat,” he
presently said, “and I’ll bring my horse
down. If he pulls you up the bank, old
Maurie ought to take you home.”
“For the love of Mike, hurry!” Paddy
entreated. “Here’s Felton coming wid
the key, and Falix the first to fill up.”
They changed 1 horses with a rush,
while at the pump Felix and his son
turned the windlass as though such things
as unions and 44-hour weeks had never
existed,
“Now, then, boy; up!”
Bill smartly slapped his horse’s flank
an( j j t started up the hill with such good-
will that the tank almost fell off. But
this did not last long. Pat and Bill urged
him up the steepest pinch, while six men
pushed behind. Paddy calculated that,
by the time he’d shouted drinks for them
all, there would be very little of the
pound left.
Still, he was beating Felix. That
person was still turning the windlass like
a miniature Hercules, the water coming
with such force as to overflow the tank
and run on to the parched ground,
Paddy and his cart reached the top
of the bank as Felix cast off and began
to back out.
“Ep boy ; ep! ” Paddy shouted, seiz-
ing the reins and beating the horse. “Ep,
boy • ep l ”
“Here,* that’s my horse!” Bill called,
chasing after the lumbering cart. “Come
back and take Maurie.”
“I’m full and away,” Paddy shouted—
“full and away.”
Felix put his hand in his pocket.
“Take y’r quid,” he called, tossing over
the money, “and may it cost ye more
than iver ye’ve won! ’Tis the Devil’s
trick ye’ve come at.”
Success had made Paddy reckless,
After putting Maureen back in the cart
he could not resist the temptation of
whipping her up in an endeavor to over-
take Felix and still be first home..
Maureen’s jog-trot, while it covered
the distance, sent the water splashing
over the sides of the tank. But Paddy
wasn’t noticing trifles—Felix had been
boss of the road too long.
Maureen was now close behind the
O’Shea cart, and, the road widening at
this point, Paddy whipped her and made
a dash for victory.
If it hadn’t been for the drift of dust,
all might have been well. The accident
happened before Paddy had time to anti-
cipate it. The cart lurched into the
powdery hole and soon the precious
water was gushing out of the battered
tank.
Regret could not mend things. The
tank, empty and sorry-looking, had to
be hoisted on the cart and taken into
town for repairs. Then Paddy had to
interview his neighbor and assure him
that all would be well,
“Don’t ye worry about the repairs,
Dick!” he said, lve told them to send
the biff to me—divil a bit will ye have
to P a Y-”
. .
At the beginning ot the next month,
as Dick Mason was driving out of his
yard with the repaired tank on the cart,
Paddy Maguire came over, his face red,
abuse tumbling from him in a torrent.
“Ye’re a thafe an’ a robber an’ a
damned scoundrel!” he shouted, shak-
ing his fist and frightening the horse,
“Look at the tank—just look at it! A
new one at my expinse.”
“But you said you’d pay for it,” Dick
remonstrated. “What’s wrong with that?”
“What’s wrong? Ye’ve got a new tank
for an old one, man. I get the bill and
Y e get tank.”
“Get out of my way!” Dick started
the horse off, with Paddy raving behind
him.
“Take y’r new tank, and to hell wid
ye. Divil a favor will I iver do ye again.”
“What!” Dick stopped and wheeled
round. “A favor, did you say? Man,
may it never rain till you’ve bought a
tank and know what it is to lend it.”
And that is why, they will tell you in
their Queensland township, the drought
lasted so long.
Grief
BY MYRA MORRIS.
MISS SNELL took the lid off her
typewriter, blew away a few grains
of dust and settled herself stiffly
, •
on the hard office chair. .
It was bitterly cold. The wind eddied
m from the street. The windows were
dun, grey squares looped with dirty
strings of rain.
Miss Snell was chilled to the bone.
Her overpowdered cheeks seemed to be
peeling in flakes like an old plaster wall.
Her thin, sharp-pointed nose wore a
faint, unbecoming tinge of violet. She
was not only cold, she was miserable ;
filled to the brim with a heavy sense
of grievance.
This was one of the mornings when
her mind harped lingeringly and resent-
fully on all those detestable people
luckier than herself who were still in bed
guzzling from breakfast trays. Trays
that held, perhaps, little fingers of but-
tery toast, smooth, grey-brown, succulent
kidneys and bland eggs islanded in lakes
of white.
At Mrs. Fraser’s you were not encour-
aged to think of breakfast trays. Neither
were you encouraged to stay about the
house once breakfast was over. Nothing
less than severe illness justified your re-
maining at home during office hours.

Miss Snell looked across at Angie
Peart, the second typist, who was bend-
ing over her work, her high, shining fore-
head festooned with little loops of mousy
hair. There was a redness on Angie
Peart’s chin that, coupled with the fact
of Angie’s engagement, could have only
one meaning.
Miss Snell sniffed, and typed a couple
of letters with the incredible speed that
had placed her with Bell and Sawyer,
architects, fifteen years ago. It was
raining now. The windows looked like
ice on a muddy pond. There was a smell
of dampness in the little office that
merged in with the mustiness of ink and
wood and blotting-paper. Miss Snell
rubbed her thin, chilblained hands and
glowered. God! She’d give five years
of her life to be sitting comfortably in-
side toasting her toes over a fire and
reading the latest library book, an opened
box of chocolates under her fingers. She
thought longingly of the novel she had
commenced the night before. “Mexican
Love”!
“Letters, Miss Snell.”
Angie Peart’s indolent voice roused
Miss Snell from her gloating contem-
plation of the next chapter of “Mexican
Love.” She took the morning’s mail
from the hovering liftboy with a vague
smile, and went slickly through the pile
of envelopes. The last letter was ad-
dressed to herself. She opened it, and
read with a little stirring of excitement.
It was from Maude Barker, her step-
father’s sister, and Maude had written
to tell her that her brother was dead.
It was as if he didn’t want to live. He
had no fancy for life any longer. Just
wouldn’t make any effort —your poor Pa
.... We put him in a nice Home at the
end, but he walked out on them. And
just when we were in the middle of hav-
ing the house papered and every room
cluttered up. ... It was a terrible shock.
Miss Snell sat staring at the shiny
keys of the typewriter. Poor Pa! It
would be just like him to go dying at
the wrong time and mucking things up.
He’d always had a special talent for get-
ting in the way. He would sit huddled
close to the kitchen stove so that you
couldn’t pour out from the kettle with-
out dropping hot water on his feet. And
he had never seemed to be able to grope
his way into that dark little back bed-
room without knocking his head on the
door.
It was a long time since poor Pa had
gone to live with Maude to do her mes-
sages, and wash the steps, and take the
dogs for a run ; but she could remember
him very plainly. A meek little man
with a hollow chest, a thin apologetic
voice and a smell of eucalyptus about his
sandy whiskers that almost covered a
secondary smell of spirits.
A deep one, if you like! He had had a
good job at the tannery when her mother
had married him in her comfortable
widowhood, but he had soon lost it. He
had laughed about it, his bright blue
eyes shining—said he couldn’t stand the
smell any longer. Too sensitive, if you
pleased! Not too sensitive to keep back
a coin or two from the change when he
went down to do the messages at the
butcher’s or the greengrocer’s, nor to
mind how he left the bottoms of the
saucepans while her mother slaved at her
old hairdressing job.
And now poor Pa was dead!
The truth of it suddenly struck home
to Miss Snell as she groped in the pocket
of her sagging cardigan for a handker-
chief. Her little grey eyes, cold and
round like marbles, filled.
“Bad news,” she said in a shocked
voice. “It’s Pa. He’s dead.”
“Well, what do you know about that?”
asked Angie Peart slowly. “Your father,
Miss Snell?”
Miss Snell nodded, her eyes glazing. It
wasn’t worth a correction. Father or step-
father —there wasn’t much difference.
“Last night, early,” she said, getting
shakily to her feet and clutching at the
desk. “It’s —it’s a dreadful shock.”
“Gosh, I’m sorry,” said Angie Peart
fervently. Her kind eyes took in Miss
Snell’s slack figure that had the deflated
look of a burst balloon. “I’ll go and tell
Mr. Sawyer, Miss Snell.' He ought to
be told.”
She floated purposefully into the inner
sanctum. Mr. Sawyer, a sad-looking man
with a querulous voice, emerged.
“Sorry, Miss Snell,” he said vaguely.
“Very sad. Your father, is it not? If
you would like to go home Hadn’t
you better go now, at once? I think we
can manage.”
Miss Snell gulped into her handker-
chief.
“Thank you, Mr. Sawyer,” she said in
a low voice.
She looked dazedly at the clock on the
wall. Nearly ten. At half-past ten it was
Mrs. Fraser’s habit to make herself a cup
of tea. A cup of tea and a warm fire
—perhaps a fire in her room.
She went out walking with bowed
shoulders. The liftboy looked at her
curiously. She thought, with a dim sort
of elation, “They’ll all be saying ‘Poor
Miss Snell. She’s had to go home. Her
father’s dead. She’s all broken up.’ ”
Yes, she was prostrate with grief, she
told herself as she sat in the tram clutch-
ing her black bag, her square toes turned
in. It was sad that poor Pa had died.
But he was such a fool!
She got out at her stop and went
into a shop and bought herself some
sweets. Not chocolates. No, not choco-
lates ! Somehow chocolates did not seem
compatible with grief. Acid drops were
different. There was something sharp
and purifying about acid drops.
At the boarding-house there was the
smell of beeswax and the whine of a
vacuum-cleaner that seemed to come from
everywhere at once. Mrs. Fraser looked
at her with quick suspicion.
“I’ve had bad news,” said Miss Snell
in a choked voice. “My dear Pa —he
died last night. He’s always meant so
much to me.”
“You poor dear,” said Mrs. Fraser, her
large, harassed face suddenly warm with
sympathy. “If a cuppa tea”
“I think I’ll go straight up,” said Miss
Snell valiantly, her nose all purple, her
eyes running.
In her room it was cold, and the cheer-
less look of the empty grate shocked
her. She lay down on the freshly-made
bed, listening to the sound of the wind-
driven rain on the roof. Maggie, the
girl, came in with a broom and pan in
her hand, her eyes goggling.
“I’m that sorry, Miss Snell,” she said
comfortingly. “My own father died last
year. I’ll light you a fire.”
“No, you mustn’t trouble,” protested
Miss Snell; but her protest was faint.
After all, there was comfort in the mere
look ctf a leaping fire, and it couldn’t
hurt poor Pa. He’d like to know that
she was comfortable, with slippers on
her feet and a pillow under her head.
And she didn’t feel so bad now, watch-
ing Maggie’s expert fiddling with sticks
and little burnt-out pieces of coal and
kindlers. But it made you feel gooey
lying there just staring at the ceiling.
You just had to keep your mind occupied
or you broke down altogether....
Languidly Miss Snell fumbled under
the pillow and brought out “Mexican
Love,” popping an acid drop into her
mouth almost with an air of apology. She
was in an exciting part when she heard
a knock at the door.
It was Mrs. Fraser, entering on tiptoe
with a tray in her hands.
“I thought perhaps you might manage,”
Mrs. Fraser whispered.
“I couldn’t,” said Miss Snell weakly.
“It would choke me!”
“I know, dearie.” Mrs. Fraser’s voice
was motherly. “Sorrer’s like that. It
closes the stomach, as you might say.
But try —like a good girl.”
“‘I might manage a mouthful,” said
Miss Snell faintly.
She closed her eyes and heard Mrs.
Fraser tiptoeing away. A little warm
glow started at her heart and spread over
her body. A “good girl,” and she was
thirty-six! She would never look her
age. Never! Gosh, it was good to be
alive! She alive, and poor Pa dead! The
old silly—he had always disliked her!....
He would sit and look at her and
smile....
She leaned on one elbow and reached
for the tray. Toasted tea-cake! Perhaps
she could manage to nibble one piece.
The rain beat with renewed vigor against
the window. The flames flickered in the
grate. She opened “Mexican Love” and
settled with a sigh of content among
the pillows.
East and West.
This morning on a stream, pearl-pale,
When dark o’ night had ceased,
With sturdy arms and swinging oars
We rowed unto the East.
The round sun rose, and golden lights
Around, about us shone,
As past green lawns and gardened slopes
We joyed to journey on.
We, who went East, are heading West,
Towards sunset somehow bound—
Oh, tell me, Comrades of the Dawn,
What turned our boat around?
Let us row on, and ever on,
Nor on our travels rest —•
Though, where we once rowed to the East,
We now row to the West.
N.S.W.

RACTIC ALLY every man, between
youth and old age, handles a
fortune.
The question is—“ How much of the
money which has passed through his
hands has simply disappeared, and how
Omeh has been used so as to provide
against inevitable old age, sickness and
death?”
Not every man can make investments
that are remunerative and permanent,
but, happily, the system of life assur-
ance puts easily within his reach a means
of securing the future for himself and
those who look to him.
