to the cork by a wire, so that the blacking can be used by

will not soil the most delicate clothing.

offer spurious imitations under the lure of being cheap;
the principle on which each is prepared is confined

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears hia name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe, lie has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to hit
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment, liis practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

gressions or excesses of more nature age, bladder

been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tend QNE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO

VOUS DEBILIT Y. Should you require medical

detailing every experienced symptom. He will

used and answered they are destroyed by fire,

This pamphlet is specially written to show a method of
counteracting the ill effects of indiscretions in early life,
over-work, mental worry, &c., and contains a fund of use-
ful information for every sufferer from the following com-
plaints, viz Loss of Energy and Will Power, NERVOUS
DEBILITY, Pains in the Back, Defective Memory, Specks
before the Eyes, Excessive Nervousness, Premature
Decay, Bashfulness, Excessive Heart Palpitation, Des-
pondency, Impure Blood, Liver and Kidney Complaints,
Contagious Diseases, and various other symptoms experi-
enced by Nervous Sufferers.
This Pamphlet is sent Free on Application,
and all in any way suffering from the above would derive
benefit from the perusal of this work.
If the patient’s case is of long standing, and, therefore
in need of treatment, he should lose no time in writing

which 1 will at once reply, explaining the nature of his
complaint, and if I can effect a cure, the time it will take
and the cost of doing so. My long experience in the
treatment of Nervous Diseases has made me thoroughly
conversant with all their, peculiarities. I am prepared
therefore, to
Guarantee a Permanent and Complete Cure in every case I undertake.
I invite the fullest investigation into my qualifications. For some time I was llouse Surgeon to the Great

SATURDAY, JUNE 27, 1891.
The Republic Comes Along.
It is safe to say that, up to the present, no
droller reading has been placed before the
New South Wales public than the leading
articles in the bulk of the Sydney journals
dealing with the probable result of the
general election of June 1891. What makes
these articles so attractive is their delightful
imbecility. When imbecility is kept in the
background or tied to a bed-post, as in the
case of gibbering George 111., or the late
mad King of Bavaria, the public passes
pityingly along and makes no sign. But
when, day after day, this hebetude obtrudes
itself in the leading columns of the metro-
politan papers, the case becomes serious and
demands attention. For the question
amounts to this, “is there any good reason
why the manhood of the oldest and, in many
Avays, the leading Australian State should
be diurnally treated to a rechauffe of politi-
cal fiction which, like the murder of Madame
Judy by her incorrigible husband, M. Punch,
is too transparently a ‘put-up job’ to
engender any feelings but those of merri-
ment in the spectators ? ” A little clowning
is good in its way. Like a mild cigarette it
helps digestion and tends to make men
agreeable. It is when the journalistic merry-
andrew claims to be serious and to demand
that his bald jokes should be received as
obvious truths that the public gets its back
up and becomes curious to know what
manner of men are these editors and writers
who appear to have such a contempt for the
understanding of the great majority of their
fellow-citizens.
* * *
The foregoing paragraph is suggested by
the fact that, up to the present moment, the
New South Wales capitalistic press wallows
in the poor affectation of believing that the
voice of the country as expressed at the
ballot-box favours Freetrade and the stability
of the Parkes Government. Now that voice
really means sudden death to the present
regime of sycophancy, and a short shrift
to free Foreign-trade as well as to that
bastard child of monopoly—freedom of con-
tract, as the phrase is understood by special
constables. It means much more. In simple
but precise words, which there is no misunder-
standing, this same voice proclaims that
government by trickery and chicane is in
need of extreme unction ; that Labour—
imperfectly organised as it is—has secured a
legislative recognition hitherto denied it,
and that the true Democracy of New South
Wales, if it but play its hand properly with-
out any attempt to revoke, has the future of
the State in its palm. Nor does the lesson
of the struggle stop here. For, in addition
to all this, the polling at the Sydney and
suburban booths alone writes upon the wall
some messages which require no Daniel to
interpret, which a child might understand,
but which the spooks of the Press decipher
iii a manner to make one pause and reflect
on the heights of impudence to which men
will scramble when tilled with the rancour
of commercial or class prejudice. Be it ours
to render into plain English a few of the
electoral messages so grotesquely construed
by the Mohawks of the daily Press.
# * *
To begin with, Parkes and his morally
ragged regiment must go—not with the
honours or war, with flags flaunting and
bands braying ; but with facings torn oft’,
uniforms tattered, and a couple of lusty pipers
and drummers bringing up the rear with a
melody appropriate to the occasion. This
must be the first move ; for progress is im-
possible so long as he and his clientele con-
tinue to hold down New South Wales as the
Lilliputians did the good-natured giant
Gulliver whom they caught asleep. That
he has held office so long and done so little
will for years be remembered as an apt
illustration of the small amount of know-
ledge combined with the large quantity of
charlatanism that is required to govern men.
His whole political life is but a dreary
record of successful chicane crossed and re-
crossed by meandering streamlets of slobber
oyer the advantages of monarchical institu-
tions and the virtues of a Royal Family
whose males travel the country as magsmen
while the females would scarcely stoop to
touch him or his with the handles of their
fans. True it is that Sir Henry Parkes
boasts of having done more than any of his
contemporaries to swell the bulk of the
colonial Statute-book. But an examination
of his measures shows that the good in them
is filched from unacknowledged sources,
while the bad is invariably his own. As it is
impossible to build a new house till the old
one is razed and the debris removed, so the
producers of New South Wales have at last
come to the conclusion that legislative ad-
vance or amelioration is an idle dream till
the knights and lacqueys who have so long
obstructed it are warned to up and clear the
way.
* # #
The second fact brought prominently for-
ward at the late ballot-box examination is
that the monarchical form of rule, with its
inevitable accompaniments of flunkeyism,
fawning servility and squalor is malodorous
to the nostrils of the great majority. In
this particular the Australian worker is
radically opposed to the Australian drone.
The latter, unable in most cases to reach
distinction by the legitimate means of
moral or intellectual worth, endeavours to
obtain it by trailing in the mire the poor
modicum of manhood bestowed on him by
nature. By a course of conduct mostly made
up of sycophancy he occasionally obtains
leave from an elderly lady in a distant land
to wear a cross on his breast and place three
or more letters after his name. Whether
the gods ever smile is a question that has
never been satisfactorily settled. But if
anything could force, not alone a smile, but
a guffaw from them it would surely be the
contemplation of a mature or elderly man
who took pride in being permitted to wear
a piece of crooked metal on his coat. It is
against such tomfoolery and its attendant
arrogance, as well as against the system
that encourages men to make such exhibi-
tions of themselves, that the proletariat
of New South Wales protest. They object
to be dragged down to the level of every
bourgeois that exposes Democracy to the
sneers of those who accuse its advocates of
greed for pinchbeck honours. We believe
we are but voicing the sentiments of the
Australian craftsman and labourer when we
assert that, however much they desire, as
we do, a welding of the provinces into one
homogeneous mass, the federation offered
them by the late Convention—a federation
which makes provision for trumpery titles
and a vice-regal court, presided over by a
sprig of royalty—is not the union they
desire. They see no reason for congratula-
tion in the prospect of a court of blowsy
knights and half-naked women. If Sir
Henry Parkes and hishangers-on wish to see
real nakedness in squalid juxtaposition with
the highest titles, let them go to the England
of which they mouth, and contemplate at
their leisure the three or four millions of
starving paupers, or the ten or twelve millions
who, from day to day, live within a month’s
march of the workhouse. Let them tell
these half-starved ones of Britain’s glorious
past pand of the high morals of the dynasty
which for 177 years has lived on the fat of
the land. Sir Henry and his henchmen can
then return and tell Australian workmen
what monarchy and courts and titles have
done to make the Briton contented and
happy.
* # #
The labour-vote of Wednesday last week is,
therefore, an essentially Republican one.
It is an unmistakable protest against intro-
ducing into a new country, of vast potentiali-
ties, the political and social absurdities that
are so rapidly decaying in the old land
where their roots seemed so firm in the soil.
For this gradual, but fundamental, change
in the ideas of the colonial artificer and
wage-earner we take to ourselves some
credit. For over a decade The Bulletin
has endeavoured, so far as in it lay, to show
that monarchy, aristocracy and sacerdotalism
were a trinity of wens on the face of
society, and that, so far from preseiviug
a community and making it prosperous
or contented, they began by destroying
its self-respect and ended by destroy-
ing itself We claim to have assiduously
watered the Democratic acorn which has
become such a goodly sapling and which
gives every promise of growing into a sturdy
oak. In its virility we never lost faith even
when at times some of its branches showed
symptoms of decay. Ihese symptoms have
passed away, and we hope to be pardoned
for a little exuberance on discovering by last
week’s vote how deep into the soil of our
adopted country the roots have struck. In
one sense a newspaper is like an individual.
When the latter finds the efforts of years
ultimately successful he forgets in that
success the anxieties and disappointments of
the struggle. So with a journal. When it
sees the tree it planted and tended
approaching a vigorous maturity the sight is
a welcome one. Without desiring to dwell
longer on this phase of the subject we can
honestly say that to no group of persons in
broad Australia was the phenomenal success
of last week’s labour-vote more pleasing
than to those connected with The Bulletin.
•* ' #
We have said that the labour-vote points
unmistakably towards a coming Great Aus-
tralian Federated Republic. This, after all,
is no matter for surprise. The sempiternal
drivel poured out by Sir Henry Parkes and
his satellites regarding the glories of England,
of her political and social system, her aris-
tocracy, her Parliament, and her monarch
had precisely the opposite effect to that in-
tended. In trying to precipitate Federation
in order to save himself from the “ creature
Protection ” which a couple of years ago he
affected to despise, he really gave Democracy
a lift on the road to fruition and adroitly
hoisted himself with his own petard. The
project of Imperialism which he had at heart,
of union “under the Crown”—the very
expression is fraught with future mischief—
of eternal Australian subordination to a
small, distant island, of squalid titles for
political apostacy, and of vice-regal rule
by a royal dummy, did much to awake
New South Wales workmen to the dangers
ahead. This awakening was materially
helped by the visit of Sir George Grey, on
whose record as a cultivated and consistent
democrat there is no stain. Grey, it is true,
has left Australia for his island home, but
not before he had planted ideas which ger-
minated with unprecedented rapidity. The
rapidity with which political thought has
ripened within a short time may be gauged
by recent labour-votes in New Zealand,
South Australia, Victoria, and New South
Wales. And if the Sydney ballot-boxes told
such a tale as they did in spite of hasty
labour organisation and of plural-voting, it
requires no prescience to reckon what their
story will be when organisation is complete
and bricks-and mortar disfranchised. Con-
sidering that in one of the smallest suburban
constituencies 500 plural votes were polled,
nearly all in favour of one candidate, the
outlook for readers of Riot Acts and their
abettors is by no means re-assuring. There-
fore, it is that the two things which Labour
must take in hand without a moment’s delay
are organisation and the single vote proposal.
Let the former be but complete while the
latter is the law of the land, and there lies
before the New South Wales wage-earner a
future such as his English or American
brother has never contemplated even to this
day.

Suppose that by some chance Sir Henry
Parkes remained at the head of affairs. Is
he sincere in his promise to take the initia-
tive and do his best to make One-man-one-
vote the law of the land 1 The question
answers itself. Was he ever in his life
politically sincere ? Has not his whole
career been merely a secular counterpart of
the ecclesiastical part played by the historical
Vicar of Bray ? The worthy Vicar, according
to the song, cared nothing for politics or
parties so long as he retained his living. The
worthy Premier may be safely accused or
congratulated on never having ikept a poli-
tical promise when there was'more to be
gained by breaking it. He began by fashion-
ing toys to his liking—he ends by endeavour-
ing to fashion men. Observe his tactics
regarding the abolition of plural-voting. In
his praiseworthy desire—praised by the
Sydney press—to make the measure a com-
prehensive one, he pleasantly yokes it with
the female-suffrage proposal. For the latter,
people are not ripe, or, better still, they are
so ripe that, if the community could be
represented by unity, those in favour of
woman-suffrage might be represented by
unity also, with the decimal point some dis-
tance to the left and five or six cyphers
intervening. The result is obvious. Out
goes the woman’s bill taking the man’s with
it as if to show that wherever there’s a
female there’s a male after her. So the
Premier sits complacently down, sends to
the papers the latest note he got from the
obscurest British nobleman, and declares he
would have passed the single-voting Bill but
for the Opposition. New South Wales
believes him, and, twenty years hence—he
puts down his prospective age at 120—-he
again rises in his Parliamentary seat to
protest that no man should have more than
one vote.

Perhaps of all post-election cries, the most
bizarre was Sydney Daily Telegraph’s
“ Freetrade and Federation are both safeas
if they were not mutually destructive. By
stipulating for one the other becomes im-
possible, and vice versa. The foreign-trader
who, in a congress of the six colonies, looks
for the triumph of his whimsical economic
fads, is not far removed in general under-
standing from the ingenious person who
tried to escap; from his shadow by running.
There remains the financial aspect of the
affair, or the effect of the situation on the
public credit. There is little doubt that the
conservative and plutocratic portion of the
Press will do its best, as it did in Victoria
during the Beery regime, to injure that
credit, by representing the new political
force as a disturbing element—a sort of
“Mountain,” such as appeared in French
politics a hundred years ago. But it will
not take the British creditor long to discern
that, the higher the plane reached by Labour,
the greater the stability of the State. Deter-
mined advances, it is true , will have to be made
on all sides. A bloody and insensate penal
code will have to be remodelled if only to
show that convictism and its ideas are things
of the past; from every page of the Statute
Book abuses call for reform or removal—
abuses that no PARKES-gang would ever
touch ; the whole rotten system of “ freedom
of contract ” will require to be subjected to
a searching analysis, and some movement
may be made towards controlling that liberty
of bequest which has done so much to per-
petuate superabundance on the one hand
and misery on the other. But all these
movements are essentially conservative in
the best sense of the word, and will end by
strengthening, rather than undermining, the
national credit. It should never be for-
gotten that years ago, in Victoria, the public
credit prospered in proportion as the Mel-
bourne Argus puled.
Compulsory Insurance.
This is conspicuously the age of “grandmotherly
legislation.” We do not recollect at the present
moment which fool it was who invented that
useful phrase, but the amount of service it has
done is incalculable. Grandmotherly legisla-
tion, in a general sense, includes all legislation
that is intended to promote the happiness and
well-being of the great mass of humanity.
Before this term was discovered the general
idea of law-makers was that the mass of
humanity had no necessity for happiness or
well-being, and therefore there was abundance
of law to authorise hanging, flogging, and trans-
portation, and to give a friendly lift to the
Church, and to shore up the landholder and the
monopolist, but at that point the duty of the
Legislature came to an end. Grandmotherly
legislation has included, among other things,
the factory laws, whereby the bloated and sin-
blasted Christian was no longer allowed to keep
children, Just emerging from infancy, at work
in a stifling atmosphere for sixteen hours per
diem ; it embraced the abolition of flogging in
the army and navy, the restriction of the grand
old hanging programme, the extinction of that
famous System which the old British Tory
established at Botany Bay, and many other
things of a like character. It is still raked up
as a term of reproach and contempt by the
Tory press, and is heaved at everything which
is done or attempted for the relief of human
misery, for the Tory press longs for a return to
the hyaena-like legislation of the old, blood-
stained past; and it is used to describe an
alleged tendency to national degeneration, which
is supposed to arise through the civilised world
having a porous-plaster supplied to it by the
Government, and having its feet put in hot
water, and a rag tied round its head at the
expense of the State. For it is a sort of un-
written axiom of the old, pig-headed school of
philosophy that the greatness of the British
people arose out of a certain coarse hardihood
which was made up indiscriminately of ignor-
ance, kicks, poverty, want of ventilation, hang-
ing, flogging, bull-fights, dog-fights, cock-fights,
drink, “ freedom of contract,” free competition,
the law of demand and supply, and all manner
of brutality and injustice in general. And,
therefore, when anything is attempted that
interferes with these established institutions, it
comes under the head of grandmotherly
legislation, by which term it is meant to be
understood that it is impossible in the first
place, and flabby and idiotic in the second.
• • •
The theory of compulsory and universal life
insurance, as a partial remedy for universal
poverty, comes naturally into this obnoxious
category. It is not Socialism in any strict or
well-defined sense of the term, but it has a cer-
tain Socialist tendency which arouses the un-
speakable disgust of the old, crusted Conserva-
tive. Therefore when the subject is mentioned
the Conservative organs usually treat it with a
certain pitying derision as a delusion that is too
glaring to require refutation, and placidly
deposit it in the dust-heap, along with astrology,
fetichism, Mumbo-Jumboism, or any other
busted myth of old-time ignorance. They deal
with it, in fact, as the average British journalist
deals with the subject of Protection—not by
advancing a single argument to ■ prove its
fallaciousness, but by airily taking it for granted
that everybody has long since recognised it as a
fallacy, and that its adherents—if they exist at
all—are merely a few unConsidered lunatics
whose opinions are sufficient evidence of their
derangement. Here and there, however, a
more than usually intelligent Tory descends
into figures and facts, and proves conclusively
that the idea of furnishing an endowment for
everybody’s widow and orphans, and supplying
an annuity for everybody who is too old to
work, is a hopeless impossibility ; but as the
same kind of Tory proved as conclusively in the
past that the locomotive and the steamboat
were delusions, and that the telegraph was a
lie, this amounts to very little. The cause of
this morbid tendency is not difficult to find.
The modern Conservative descends with a blast
of anger and ridicule upon every proposal for
abolishing or mitigating poverty, because he
lives upon poverty in all its shapes and varieties.
It is the poverty of the landless class which
strengthens the position of the landlord, for,
despite manhood suffrage and other reforms, the
party with the largest banking-account keeps
uppermost. It is the poverty of the worker
which is the salvation of the monopolist, for
nine strikes out of every ten collapse through
sheer hunger. And it is the grinding misery of


the countless thousands of old and partially
disused toilers both male and female,
which makes it absolutely certain that,
under present conditions, the supply of “free
labour ” will never run short. Therefore, the
monopolist howls with unearthly derision at
every proposition for the extinction of poverty,
and recommends a wide and Christian charity
as the only possible alleviation of human
suffering. And in doing this he is wise in his
day and generation. For as charity is a thing
that can be withdrawn at any moment, it
makes the receiver the abject slave of the
giver ; and, moreover, it serves as an advertise-
ment for the capitalist, and tones down the
public feeling against him, and also furnishes
him with a convenient brick to throw at his
detractors,' who, as a rule, are not charitable
through the want of the necessary assets. In
short, it is a virtue of which he has a close
monopoly, for it is the only virtue which a poor
man cannot exercise on any scale that is large
enough to get into the newspapers ; and, there-
fore, he booms it to the uttermost.
• * *
■ The shortest answer to the argument of that
stupendous liar, the Tory political economist,
is that the system of compulsory national
insurance has been tried, and with amazing
success. For over two centuries this policy
prevailed in and during that period
—so far as the artisan classes were concerned—
povei’ty ivets abolished. The insurance system
was established, not by the Government—for
no English Government ever possessed brains
enough for such an experiment—but by those
gigantic trades-unions, the mediaeval guilds.
No shearers’ union that was ever blasted by
the Argus, or cursed with the great anathema
of the S.M. Herald, wielded an authority
to be compared with that of these forgotten
institutions, and so long as they lasted, and
so far as their power extended, they created
a golden age for the artizans of England. There
was no “freedom of contract” in those days
for no one could practise any trade except by
joining the guild. There was no “free com-
petition,” for the blackleg was not invented,
and the guilds were strong enough to supply an
efficient guarantee that they would not be
invented. Also, there were no strikes, for the
guilds almost ruled the Kingdom in their palmy
days, and their internal strength made strikes
unnecessary, and therefore their funds were
devoted to maintaining the largest and most
comprehensive system of life-insurance on re-
cord. They provided for all their poorer
members in their old age. They maintained
the widows and children of all members who
had died leaving an insufficient provision
behind them, and they furnished education for
the young, and dowries for marriageable daugh-
ters. The system was compulsory in the widest
sense of the term, for the guilds levied sub-
scriptions upon all their members, and by a
process of “moral suasion,” which was very
much akin to excommunication, they included
among their members all the tradesmen of the
country. And, except among agricultural
labourers and a few other classes whose pur-
suits were still conducted on the grand old
principle of freedom of contract, they abso-
lutely abolished want and destitution, and
effectually gave the lie to the blatant assertion
that poverty is a necessary evil, to be alleviated
only by charity and pious drivel, and patience
and humility.
* • *
If the guilds had survived, the chances are
that they would have extended their operations
until at last they would have embraced all
classes of the community, and, if so, English
history would have been very different from
what it is. For then Freetrade and Free Com-
petition would never have been discovered, and
destitution would never have been invented,
and workhouses would have remained unbuilt,
and every human being in all the English
nation would have possessed an adequate pro-
vision for his old age, and have left his family
at least sufficient to preserve them from abso-
lute want. But Henry VIII. confiscated the
property of the guilds wholesale amid the tur-
moil of the Reformation, and he and his harem
and his fellow Reformers had the greatest burst
in all history upon the proceeds. That big
religious outbreak known as the spoliation of
the great monasteries was made by a wonder-
ful excess of zeal to cover the spoliation of
the great Trades-Unions also, and a dozen or
more of the noble families of England were
founded upon the savings which the artisan
class had accumulated in the slow course
of centuries ; the whole social system was
broken up, and in a few years the country
was flooded with thousands of homeless out-
casts, and then new laws were enacted against
poverty, and vagrants were hanged and flogged
and branded as the handiest remedy for the
evils which the Government had brought upon
them. And a little later the slave-trade was
invented by the infamous Hawkins, and then
the great soul of England rose to the occasion,
and the destitute inhabitants of the mother-
land were sold to toil in life-long servitude on
the Virginian plantations ; and as a fit appendix
to this great scheme the soul-blasting device of
State charity came into existence, and paved
the way for the huge monopolies which have
since made the English people mere beasts of
burden in the service of Capital. Trades-
Unionism has never recovered from that fatal
experience of three centuries ago. It is a mere
shadow of its former self, struggling feebly
against the “vested interests” which were
built upon the ruins and out of the plunder of
its ancient institutions.
• * *
Still the memory of that great mediaeval
experiment proves conclusively that poverty in
the main is curable, and that a system of uni-
versal and compulsory insurance is absolutely
practicable. And by reviving, on a far larger
scale, the methods of the old trades-unions a
great step can be gained. The policy of the
guilds provided for old men, widows, and
orphaned children, and if these three classes
were removed from the great industrial army
to-day the gain to Labour would be enormous.
The existing unions cannot absorb them or pro-
vide for them, and therefore cheap female and
child labour is superseding the male unionist in
a vast number of industries. This floating
quantity has hitherto defied organisation, and
it furnishes a supply of “ free labour ” which is
of incalculable value to Capital. A system of
universal State insurance, supported entirely
by taxation, would extinguish so much of that
hopeless poverty on which the accursed law of
Demand and Supply is based, that the indus-
trial problem would become comparatively easy
of solution. It would not in itself furnish the
solution, for nothing short of absolute Socialism
can ever remedy the evils that trouble humanity,
but as a means to the great end it would be in-
valuable. Anything that can alleviate penury
is a gain to the cause of Labour, for Monopoly
is built on the destitution of the masses, and
Capital lives mainly upon Want in its most
abject form. If it could be supposed, with any
show of reason, that such an alleviation would
induce the democracy to abandon all further
effort and rest content, then it would be better
that the experiment were left alone ; but if—as
we firmly believe—it would merely prove an
efficient weapon in the contest between incar-
nate Wealth and embodied Poverty, then the
advantage to be gained is worth almost any
price that could be paid for it.
» * *
The one apparently unanswerable argument
against the establishment of a system of State
insurance—a system so vast and comprehensive
that it would furnish a small but still a valu-
able provision for every citizen when incapaci-
tated by poverty and old age, and also support
thfe widows and children who arc left otherwise
destitute—is this : the cost of such a scheme
would bankrupt any nation which attempted
the experiment. Apparently this theory is un-
answerable ; in reality it is more empty than
air. Almost every nation in existence is even
now wasting its energy on experiments of a far
larger and more costly character, which pay no
dividends and yield no possible return, and
which are, nevertheless, regarded as matters of
comparatively small importance. The money
which England scattered in twenty short years
of frenzied warfare, for the purpose of extin-
guishing the liberties of France, would —if
properly applied have created a system
whereby destitution might have been abolished
in England to the end of time. If the
extinction of poverty throughout England be
impossible, then the Napoleonic wars were also
impossible, and if they went through the
empty form of taking place, that fact makes
not the slightest difference—they were impos-
sible none the less. The sum which France
fooled away in twelve mouths upon a useless
struggle with Germany would have done the
same good service to the French people, and thus
another impossibility is demolished. A moderate
tax upon land values would furnish ample
means for the great experiment in Australia—
in fact, the means are nowhere wanting, and in
any case the demand upon the nation would be
more apparent than real. For though the cost
of a scheme for the abolition of the destitute
classes may appear formidable, it must be taken
into account that these same classes already
live, in some shape or form, at the charge of the
State. The price of them may be reckoned up
in the cost of gaols, benevolent asylums,
hospitals, and similar expenses ; and as the
destruction of poverty would destroy, at the
same time, the whole degrading, soul-wrecking,
and ruinous system of charity the gain would,
in a great measure, counterbalance the loss.
The only reason why the project is impractic-
able is that this world of shams and military
idiocy seldom grows enthusiastic except over
projects of destruction. The “ spirits of our
fathers ” are ready to start from every wave
when the question at issue is the bombardment
of some helpless, forlorn, and unoffending
nigger ; they never start worth a cent in any
cause that is of the slightest service. The flag
that braves the battle and the breeze falls into
a cataleptic state except when it is floating over
some scene of slaughter, where the legal tender
of the Anglo-Saxon people is being blown away
in useless smoke. The great soul of the nation
rises nobly to the occasion when the occasion
consists of war and carnage and the blare of
trumpets and the thunder of the big but inane
drum ; it falls with a dull thud at all other
seasons. When the matter at issue is one that
concerns destruction and wholesale breakage
the word “ fail ” is nowhere to be found in the
bright lexicon of patriotic drivel; but at other
times the said lexicon is a limp and broken-
backed contrivance that is filled with impossi-
bility. And from these causes the scheme
which we have described is most probably im-
practicable. As a theory it is undoubtedly
feasible, but all the economic theories on earth
will not keep a nation which lacks the courage
to put them into practice.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Swindling the Nation.
A huge, ungodly swindle which, for its cast-
iron cheek and its tremendous assurance, has
very few equals, is being perpetrated just now
by the Victorian pastoralist at the cost of the
Victorian nation ; and the nation is so much
used to being swindled by the pastoralist that
it hardly even kicks at the process. Some
years ago, when that enormous stretch of
country known as the Mallee district was a
mere howling wilderness, immense tracts of
land were let out to squatters at a nominal
rental of 2s. 6d. per square mile, or about five
acres for a farthing per annum. This was long-
before the days of irrigation, and the value of
the Mallee country was then an unknown quan-
tity. But within the last few years it has been
discovered that this unconsidered waste is really
the richest land in the province, and when a
sudden demand for Mallee country set in the
local squatter longed to raise a boom in the
district, and to sell allotments, and dispose of
townships by auction. The one difficulty in
the way was the unpleasant fact that he had
not one single inch of land to sell, and was only
a lessee at five acres for a farthing, with a 12
years tenure, but this consideration was of
small account when a profitable speculation
was in view. All over the Mallee country the
joyous pastoralist put up the familiar legend —
“These allotments for sale by auction.” and
started gaily to sell off thousands of pound*
worth of land that he didn’t own, arid to trade
away the nation’s inheritance, and annex the
proceeds. The purchaser got the property at
about half its value in consideration of taking
his chance of being turned off afterwards, but
it was generally felt that if the Government
didn’t interfere with the Seller, who was the
primary swindler in the transaction, it could
not, in common decency, eject the purchaser,
who was only the secondary embezzler; and,
therefore, the allotments went off gaily, and
the land which was leased at 2s. 6d. a square
mile was sold at 15s. an acre, and the squatter-
man held high carnival on the proceeds. Then
the attention of the Lands Department was
“drawn” to this tremendous fraud, and that
office rose to the occasion. It didn’t arrest the
whole gang of speculators for doing the biggest
embezzlement on record and for obtaining enor-
mous sums of money on false pretences, and get
them ten years’ penal servitude apiece ; and-
failing this—it didn’t arrest the Government for
letting the nation’s property be stolen away
and thus becoming accessory to a fraud. The
Minister for Lands visited the district instead,
and, having viewed the proceedings on the spot,
he reported that—
It was merely a question whether the lessees should be
allowed to make money out of the land, or whether set-
tlement should be stayed until the land reverted to the
Government some dozen years hence.
This resolution is very like what a Minister of
Lands would be sure to say under such circum-
stances. Yet there are several considerations
in the case which are worth noting. (1) If the
Minister had leased his own laud instead of the
nation’s, and his tenant calmly collared the
property, and sold it as if it were his own, and
annexed the proceeds, the said Minister would
assuredly raise eleven separate kinds of Sheol
over the job, and tear after his tenant
with a warrant. (2) If there is any dire
necessity for trading off the last of the national
property right away, there is no need whatever
to wait till the present leases expire; the
lessee can simply have the short alternative of
giving up his lease and his plunder and quitting
the country, or else going to gaol for felony,
and the difficulty is settled in an instant. If
the land in question were the Minister’s own
property he would notice this circumstance—
unless he is every possible variety of a public
ignoramus. (3) Even if the country had to
wait a dozen years before selling the Mallee
lands it makes no possible difference. The
choice lies between getting most probably a few
million pounds twelve years hence, when the
increasing scarcity of land will have added
immensely to the value of this remnant of the
public estate ; or getting nothing either now or
hereafter, save the empty satisfaction of a boom
in the census-returns. And if it were the
Minister’s own land that was in question, it is
safe to assert that he would decide in such a
case to let the census-returns go to perdition or
any other convenient locality. (4) Even if the
country had to wait 120 years instead of 12 it
makes no difference either. For under existing
social conditions increased population brings
only poverty and misery, degradation, low
wages, the sweating-system, and similar evils,
and to give away the national estate gratis in
order to hurry up the national curse is the very
embodiment of insanity. And if the Lands
Department can realise none of these things it
would be interesting to know which politi-
cian’s uncle is in the Mallee swindle, for some-
body’s uncle is always involved when such
astonishing obtuseness is manifested.
The “Suicide Clause.”
The Ballantyne insurance case, in Melbourne,
has two morals, and they are both very large
ones. First, the insurance company which
retains in its policies the old conservative
proviso that the insurance shall be null and void
if the policy-holder dies by suicide, makes a
ruinous mistake; and second, the man who
insures under such conditions is an ass. The
deceased Ballantyne, of course, thought,
when he took out his policy, that the proviso
made no possible difference; the clause stated
that he must not suicide within two years from
the date of the insurance, and he had no idea of
suiciding at any time within ten centuries.
Unfortunately, however, he got drunk within
the forbidden period, and finished up by going-
out with a gun and depositing his brains in an
adjacent paddock, and then the company de-
clined to pay, and the usual expensive law-suit
followed. The “suicide clause,” of course,
was not actually meant to cover cases like
these ; it was drawn up on the supposition that
an insurance office was liable to be pervaded by
speculative individuals who habitually insured
their lives and then blew their heads off with
firearms in order to collect the money ; and as
an example of commercial lunacy it has few
equals. For it it is only once in several cen-
turies that the world produces a man who
suicides as a pure matter of business. The man
who actually does suicide, does it with a rush,
and has no time to ‘insure his life, there-
fore the class of individuals that the
suicide clause is aimed at is (like the
murderers who are deterred only by fear of
capital punishment) actually non-existent,
and the insurance company might as reasonably
insert a statement that it wouldn’t pay if the
insured had three legs. The man who insures
his life for the express purpose of blowing his
head off profitably as soon as he gets his policy,
may exist in fiction, but that is all—if there be
such an individual anywhere on earth the only
dead certainty about him is that he never will
suicide at all. He might prove a source of
income, in a small way, to "a liberal-minded
office, for now and then he might come along
and pay a tremendous premium to a company
which would allow him to die by his own hand
on the doorstep as soon as he got his receipt;
but the only probable result would be that the
company would be a premium ahead. But
though the stipulation that the assured must
not die by his own hand within two years is
absolutely worthless for the purpose it was
meant to cover, it is a man-trap which no one
should wilfully walk into. For nobody knows
when he may commit suicide, and the whole
bench of English bishops may go and lie down
in front of a train to-morrow under the influence
of some insane impulse that will never be
explained or accounted for. Suicide arising
through sudden insanity is as truly death
by disease as if the patient had come to
his end by slow consumption ; and the
man who undertakes that he will not destroy
himself virtually undertakes that he will not
be seized by a certain complaint; which is
about as sane a proceeding as if he guaranteed
that lie wouldn’t be killed through a houso
falling on him. Most of the leading Australian*
offices are now intelligent enough to recognise
this fact, and when the first premium is
accepted, the insured may swallow prussic acid
and die in the middle of the floor if he wantft
to, for all they commercially care. Most of th«
English offices, however, still plod on in the old
groove, and fill their policies with clauses
stating that the insurance will be void if the
policy-holder dies by suicide or by the hang-
man, or if he dies outside certain limits, or if
he perishes while drunk ; and as any man may
become irresponsible and commit suicide, or
may be hanged and his innocence proved after
he is dead, this sort of insurance is merely an
elaborate method by which a man spends his
whole life paying premiums, and ends by
leaving nothing to his family except a law-suit.
And a few of the more conservative American
offices still adhere to the “suicide clause,” and
thus furnish material for occasional disputes of
which the Ballantyne lawsuit'is an interesting
sample.
A few days ago three individuals were charged
before the Bendigo (Vic.) Court of Petty Ses-
sions with having neglected to destroy the
rabbits on their selections, and the Law, which
never loses a chance to demonstrate its superla-
tive idiocy, acted up to its usual character.
The solicitor for the defence set up the plea
that there was no such thing as a Bendigo Court
of Petty Sessions. There had been such a Court
at Sandhurst, but Sandhurst was abolished, and
therefore there couldn’t be a Court there any
longer’, and nobody had inserted an advertise-
ment in the Government Gazette stating that
there was a Court at Bendigo. Therefore,
though the Court was there, yet it wasn’t
there; and Sandhurst was officially gone, and
Bendigo hadn’t officially arrived, and conse-
quently there was no place at all thereabouts,
and the case must fall through in consequence.
And the case did fall through there and then.
The town was the same as before, and it was
the same Court, and the officials hadn’t changed
in a iiy way, but for want of an advertisement
stating that these things were there it was
resolved that they were non-existent. But
though the Law thus proved itself to be an ass,
it was only part of the animal—it was too great
an ass to know how to be a whole or con-
sistent mule. For the whole disturbance was
based on the assumption that the three defend-
ants were before the Court, but as there
wasn’t any Court therefore they couldn’t be
before it, consequently they must have been
somewhere else, and as they weren’t anywhere
else it naturally follows that they were
nowhere, which was a sufficient proof that
there were no defendants at all. Also, The
Court went beyond its pow ers in dismissing the
charge, for if there wasn’t any Court then there
w r as nobody there to dismiss anything; and
there wasn't anything to dismiss, for a charge
can’t be before a Court that isn’t there ; and a
Court that isn’t there can t discharge a case,
that is absent. Moreover, the solicitor’s case
broke down according to his own showdng, for
he laid his argument before the Court and at
the same time proved that there wasn’t any
Court, and if there wasn’t any Court then his
argument couldn’t be before it, and there being
no argument before it nothing had taken place
at all. Three-fourths of what is miscalled
justice now consists of technicalities, and most
of them are about as foolish as this Bendigo
stupidity.

Here is an instructive bit from the Canadian
Dominion. The Manitoba Government intro-
duced last session, into the local legislature, a
measure taxing all corporations operating in
provincial lands, railways, etc., and carried
it. The Federal Government vetoed the act,
and in April the Manitoba Government re-
introduced it and re-carried it, with a certainty
of its being re-vetoed. Conflict is inevitable—
with the final result certain to be in favour of
the Federal Government, because it is backed
up by the Imperial Parliament, yet there is no
question that equity is on the right of the
Manitobans, inasmuch as they are resisting the
exploitation of their territory by British capi-
talists. The provincialists are really fighting
against the creation of an absentee landlordism,
and, as such, they are contending for a right
which goes down to the root of their prosperity.
Yet, under the Constitution, they will have to
go to the wall. Now, a similar state of things
might arise here, and under the Convention
Bill, could only be settled by the Federal
Government, which, under the Bill, will simply
be an agent for Imperialistic syndicates, in a
way antagonistic to the desires of a State’s
people. Thus, we have another argument for a
careful survey of the Federal path before we
begin to tread it.

Supreme Court Judge Innes (N.S.W.) is now
sneering at “ servants,” forgetting that he him-
self is a servant of the State and a rather poor
one, too, considering that he gets £3OOO a year
from the State Treasury. We refer to his
Honor’s remarks in a recent master and servant
case wherein he apologised for making use of
the terms r “ master and servant,” which, in
these days, Seemed, he said, “to be objection-
able to some persons. In fact, judging from the
signs of the times, in a short while the latter
class would be styled ‘partners’ or ‘helps,’
and would have to be placed on a footing of
perfect equality with those who had to keep
them both.” Now, a turn for sarcasm in a
Judge is a very dangerous thing—for the Judge,
especially when exercised in a democratic com-
munity, and we respectfully but firmly advise
Judge Innes to stick severely to his judicial
functions, and leave social homilies severely
alone. That he and all others concerned should
accept this well-meant caution in the spirit in
which it is offered is all the more expedient by
reason of the fact that the time is not far dis-
tant when all Australian legal officials’will le
selected by a process in which the wishes and
opinions of the electors will be a much strong, r
factor than under the present system.

“Evangeline,” now kicking up its heels
at Sydney Criterion, is usually styled an opera,
but is as much akin to it as “ Widow O’Brien,
Esq.” is to comedy. Gorgeously staged, and full
of lively, if tinkly, music, its libretto is sicker
than that of most pantomimes, and the enter-
prising MacMahons might have had it fitted
with better “ talk ” through the local expenditure
of ten pounds. Here and there the business
descends to the level of white-washed nigger-
farce, and the ridiculous, mi-lmmorous heifer
should be re’egated to the theatrical dust-
bin. Fanny Liddiard undoubtedly annexes the
Abernethy for vocalism, while Johnny Gour-
lay scores heavily as a laugh-provoker, but Harry
Leston as Dietrich —Snazelle’s old part— may, in
time, push him hard. The Lone Fisherman of
Joseph Harris is a clever piece of pantomimicry
that hit the audience hard on first night, especially
the weird dance with its frantic finale, modelled
on the old Rocky-Roads-to-Dnblin, will-I-ever-
get-home-1-dunno mode of progression, an
apparent travestie on the “ County Fair ” horse-
race. George Fortescue’s Catherine seemed to
please the house vastly : tastes differ, of course,
in all things, and if the public are satisfied when
a humble critic is not, it only shows that the
latter's mental standard wants readjustment.
Virginia Earl is better placed here than elsewhere,
and her song. “I like it,” was a big go chiefly on
account of her distinct enunciation. Salvini has
a good voice and D, as a rule, funny. None of
the other folks have any great opportunities of
distinguishing themselves, but the shapely
limbs and sweet smile of one young American
lady have already ravaged the front stall-
rows where the connoisseurs in feminine flesh
do chiefly congregate. The Amazonian ballet,
shorn of its due proportions by scant stage-room,
is one of the best things of the kind yet seen here.
One quartette alone is worth a pilgrimage, and the
whistling chorus of “The wind pipes free” is
ingenious and attractive. By the way, the fisher-
man is the only one of his tribe we’ve seen who
doesn't smoke, swear and swizzle. On first night
Conductor Rice attempted to buttonhole the
audience by handing up bouquets, but they goft
tired of it, and so did he.

The Sydney theatre-going public are
greatly indebted to Janet Achurch for interpret-
ing Sara Bernhardt, in advance, at Sydney
Garrick, by playing English versions of some of
her favourite characters. After reviving “Forget-
Me-Not” for two nights—with Herbert Flem-
ming in place of Charrington, as Horace Welby,
and Harry Power, as Malleotti, in place of George
Leitch—“Adrienne Lecouvreur,” Herman’s adap-
tation of Scribe and Legouve’s play, was staged on
Saturday for three nights, and will bo superseded
by “ A Doll's House,” with which the Chaning-
t m season will conclude on Friday evening.
Manager Cunard has already gone ahead to make
dates at Goulburn, Wagga, Albury, Geelong,
Adelaide, and Broken Hill. On their way to
England the company will probably play in West
Australia and at Colombo. Adrienne is one of
Janet Aclmreh’s best impersonations. For some
unknown reason she seems suddenly to have taken
to heart The Bulletin's oft-repeated counsels, and
has eschewed her usual exaggerations in the way
of glaring, gurgling and stage-tramping, and the
result is a fine and harmonious impersonation of
the generous, misunderstood and illusedpctof the
Comedie Francaise. The Maurice de Saxe of
Herbert Flemming is brightly and evenly played ;
his affectation of mirth when the husband banters
him aboutintriguing with his mistress instead of his
wife, having the ringof spontaneity. As Miehonnct,
a sort of Triplet, Chas. Charrington’s chin and
voice were, as usual, very much in his way, never-
theless, lie got two well-earn'ed rounds of applause
for the pathos of his green-room scene. There is a
quaint flavour about every tiling done by Gerald
Moore that draws a laugh even for the most
commonplace lines, and so his Abbe de Chazeuil,
for no especially evident reason, was very popular
with the house. Emma Bronton tried hard to be
vindictive and wicked as the Princess de Buillou,
a lady whose husband is always in the consomme,
but she’s not built that way—virtue in distress is
her forte. Alice May, Meta Pelham, Wm. Hol-
man, and Harry Power filled small gaps credit-
ably. “Our Flat” goes up on Saturday night
supported by Laurence Cautley, Hans Phillips,
Charles Brown, H. Bennett, Marie Brooke, Mrs.
Hill, Miss Gallagher, E. W. Royce, Edwin Kelly,
W. F. Clitheroe, Mary Kingsley, Polly Emery,
Gertie White.

There is nothing fresh to be chronicled in
connection with the “ County Fair,” except that
Madge Seymour now plays Taggs, after a sub-
dued fashion, in lien of Virginia Earl, who has
joined the Evangeline ” crowd lower down the
street. Arrangements have been concluded, it is
understood, for the appearance of Sara Bernhardt
at Her Majesty’s on the Conclusion of her Adelaide
season; date, probably Bth J uly. Meantime,
“The Lyons Mail,” with Wi liam Rignold, one of
Sydney’s chiefest favourites, as Lesurques and
Dubose, goes up on Saturday next. The Bern-
hardt season will run for 19 nights and 3 matinees.
She will play her Melbourne programme, but will
produce “ Pauline Blanchard ” for the first time
on any stage. G. L. Goodman will move into
Pitt-street in the interests of W. & G.

Despite rain and elections, business has
been so unvaryingly good with the Opera Com-
pany at Sydney Royal that “ Gondoliers ” could
be run at least another fortnight profitably. So
it has been decided not to break up the season,
but to run it for all it is worth till its conclusion
on 7th July.

All who know manager Lannour, and a
great many who don’t know him, will regret to
hear that the tremendous gale on Sunday night
completely unroofed the main balcony at Congee
Aquarium, and did much damage to the main
building.

At Bondi Aquarium a plentiful use of
battens and all-night supervision on the part of
of the übiquitous Wyburd averted any serious
consequences that might otherwise have accom-
panied last Sunday’s cyclone, and the show will

The third French week at Melbourne
Princess’ was the same as the preceding two in the
matter of attendance, if not more so. For
the first (Monday’s) performance of “ Adrienne
Lecouvreur ” there were plenty of seats to spare
downstairs and in the amphitheatre, but this
apparent re-action collapsed as soon as it had set
in, and subsequent nights found people paying
their money for the proud right of standing up.
“ Frou-Frou,” with nothing in the way of scenery
to it, was so played as to move most of the house
to tears. The scene between the two sisters—in
which they pour out their feelings at a pace which
defies Pitman’s system, and would kill a type-
writer on the spot—will be talked of in Melbourne
when the maidens of to-day are mixing powders
for their children’s children. Bernhardt’s per-
formance of Gilberte, the spoilt wife, represents
the character in a light softer and more redeeming
■ than she has been shown upon the English stage.
Shelias, too, the artistic advantages of a delight-
ful sister in Jane Mea, and a grand, giddy papa,
in Munie. The latter comedian, here and in
“ Adrienne,” proves himself able to put feeling as
well as humour into his work. One of the best
of the quiet effects is made, by the typical old
Parisian buck, when, pulled up short by the sight
of Gilberte’s distress, he tells her that a parent
like himself seems no worse than “careless” so
long as she is contented, but “abominable” if she
be unhappy. “Frou-Frou ” contains more good,
penetrating morals than six ordinary plays; yet,
Brutus—or, rather, Varley—says it is indecent,
and Varley is an honourable man. The only fault
with “Adrienne Lecouvreur ” was a wooden lover
for Sara, who seemed to have cast one of the
weakest members of the company for the part of
Maurice de Saxe. Her devotion to this uninterest-
ing person is beautifully depicted, however, and
the tragic story of the poisoned actro s made a
profound impression in at least two of its scenes.
“ Jeanne d’ Arc ” (which we didn’t see) appears
to have been another triumph for the artiste, as
well as a spectacular success, whilst “Camille”
held them enthralled, as usual, on Saturday
night. A bare mention of a Bernhardt
performance can be accepted as equivalent
to a column of praise. This gifted woman has
educated Melbourne public opinion to a complete
understanding of what naturalness on the stage
really means, and it will be many a long day
before another Mrs. Brown-Potter can attract by
means of overdrawn caricatures of the great
original. Last week’s plays, not being of the
Sarclou series, were each published in acting form
—line for line in French and English. These
books are cheap at a shilling, and people who
read up a play beforehand, first in English and
then in French, need very little knowledge of the
language to enable them both to appreciate every
development of the story and pick up a few ideas
of Sara’s native tongue in its native turns. By
the way, the divinity displayed some expensive
millinery in “Adrienne,” and her face “left
nothing to be desired ” (as the dailies would say)
in any of the young characters. But the waits
were pretty bad again. Sara doesn’t mind the
play starting at 7.30, so long as she can enjoy her
tram-rides between the acts.
* * *
Produced on Monday night under most
irritating conditions, “Theodora” must be pro-
nounced a complete artistic success. The story
possesses stronger dramatic interest than “Cleo-
patra,” and gives Bernhardt a wider range of
opportunities to display her consummate ability.
Sardou has, in fact, supplied a phenomenal
actress with a phenomenal character, and one
which, whilst seeming impossible, is not altogether
inconsistent with historical tradition. Bernhardt,
who wears some beautiful dresses, is imposingly
supported by Duquesne, Darmont, Angela and
others, and the mounting of the show does credit
to the management. The sixth scene, Justinian’s
box in the Hippodrome, introduces a gorgeous
spectacle, and the subsequent rising of the popu-
lace, culminating in the arrest of Theodora’s lover,
is realistic to a degi’ee, but many people had
ere then gone home, disgusted by much waiting.
Indeed, the actual finish of the tragedy at ten
minutes past twelve was witnessed by little more
than half of the original audience ; yet even then
Bernhardt had her faithful admirers under sub-
jection, and when she offered her white throat to
the official strangler she sent one or two females
into hysterics. “ Theodora,” strung out into
seven acts, contained two hours of fascinatingenter-
tainment, scattered amidst two and a half hours
of intervals on its first representation. For this
insufferable state of things Madame Bernhardt is
alleged to be solely responsible ; the intervals can
be shortened if she chooses, but she does not
choose and she never will choose, until the audi-
ence rise in a lump and show their backs to a
genius who practically spits behind the curtain at
the toleration granted to her unamiable caprices.

The Bijou was not neglected last week,
although “ Moths,” poorly mounted and cramped
up on the smaller stage, was far less effective than
the Royal show of a few weeks back. “The
Idler,” on Saturday, drew a crowded house, and
therewith the Cartwright-Nethersole season con-
cluded. On Monday, the irrepressible “ Betsy ”
began to dominate the situation with a feather-
brush, and levy blackmail on a disordered house-
hold until the burden of her existence became too
much for the other people to bear. “ Betsy ” was
always a lively girl in Pattie Brown's hands, and
with Brough, Titheradge and Anson playing old
parts, the show is one long scream as usual.
“ The Magistrate ” on Saturday.

That season of comic opera so recently
“ inaugurated ” at Melbourne Opera House is to
get no further than “ Poor Jonathan,’’apparently.
Proceedings began with Jonathan, and as the
public resolutely refused to rise at him, a
number of other comic operas have been with-
drawn before they were produced. It is to be
feared that Miss Clara Mori vale’s season has not
yielded a bounteous harvest. Next Saturday will
introduce Jennie Lee, just back from New
Zealand, in the three-act comedy “ Run Wild.”

At the Royal they are bringing the relict
of the late O’Brien to a rollicking conclusion this
Saturday, after which the theatre will be handed
over to the care of carpenters and decorators for
throe or four weeks. Bridget has reverted to her
original stylo of Widow, and will drink her final
bumper of lemonade with a “ slitick ” in it aboard
the old ship Bristol.

“ The Trapper,” as produced at Melbourne
Alexandra, on Saturday, turned out to be a less
coherent kind of Wild West Show than “Tile
Scout,” and will require any number of alterations
and repairs to make it stand for the anticipated
six weeks. Little or no use is made of the tank,
nor are the Indians presented under rational eon-
ditions. Beer and other refinements of civilisation
seem to be knocking all the sense out of Carver’s
redskins, who simply form themselves into a
grinning mob, and wait for the cowboys and
Mexicans to come and stoush ’em. Their war-
paint "and feathers are wasted in this instance,
seeing that they don’t perpetrate a weird dance in
the moonlight, or do anything worthy of an ancient
race. They might just as well be lying drunk at
the bottom of the tank. The plot of “ The
Trapper ” consists of a few decayed bones that were
buried instead of Lily Dampier a longtime before
the curtain drew up. A tiring old man, with a
. terribly big round head on him, tells a long yarn
about these remains, one syllable at a time, and
an elderly female of shattered intellect is always
attempting to confess something concerning them,
whereupon a husband with a lot of stuffing up his
back generally grabs hold of the unfortunate lad}’,
so that things get no forrarder. But, fortunately,
the plot makes no difference, and in point of fact
there isn’t one at all. In the second act a bar-
room scene is enlivened by the entry of Carver
and Lily Dampier on horseback, the damsel riding
her pony astride, after the manner of her sex in
Wild West regions. Carver is about to marry
Lily, it transpires, and in a tender, sentimental
mood they sit down to play euchre, after which
they shoot the necks off the bottles in the bar and
put bullets through the electric-light until
the Sheriff arrives with the Riot Act. Then
Carver’s dear old white horse lobs in, just like the
Christian it is, and gently butts him home to
his virtuous couch with its affectionate old head.
This it a fine touch of animal nature entirely.
Nothing else in “The Trapper” goes for much
except a tableau at the. end of the third act.
“ After the Battle ” shows Dr. Carver and Lily
leaning on their rifles to contemplate a really
artistic arrangement of dead Indians, cowboys,
Mexicans and horses, that lie strewn on the gory
field. The heaving of the horses’ sides is the only
visible sign of life in the picture, and those well-
trained animals are as defunct as Julius Caesar in
all other respects. Mr. and Mrs. Dampier have
parts in “The Trapper,” but the show doesn't
contain any acting opportunities worth men-
tioning. ,

The Gaiety Company, who have been wait-
ing around and cooling their heels for three
weeks, will make a start at Melbourne Princess’
on Saturday next (27th inst.)., The burlesque
appointed for that occasion is “ Ruy Bias and the
Blase Roue,” but the name of a burlesque doesn’t
matter much so long as the legs are there. Every-
thing must have a name, however, and this is
given as a guarantee of good faith. Of the
principals that were favourites last trip, five will
reappear on Saturday—Fred. Leslie, Nellie Barren,
Danby, Fred Storey and Sylvia Grey.
At Poverty Point.
Varley writes to the Aon about Bernhardt. He doesn’t
object so much to “ Camille” as to “Tosca” and “Frou-
Frou ” horrors.
Ladies in the Melbourne stalls, -seeing Bernhardt, do
■actually take their hats off. Excellent fashion, begun at
London Savoy.
Just as Bernhardt’s scenery is fetched from Paris, so
did MacMahon make one of his first rises by fetching to
Melbourne Irving’s scenery of “Romeo and Juliet,”
enshrining Miss Reid, the actress, with Cates as Romeo,
which Beilew had been acting all over Britain, in front of
Irving’s scenery.
Sara Bernhardt chops all round the troupe for leading
man. Fleury, Duquesne, Darmont, and Rebel have re-
spectively had a show as Armand Duval, Scarpia, Antony,
and Maurice de Saxe, in “ Adrienne Lecouvreur." This
provokes emulation ; and Angelo, still in the Co., was
her leading man in London ten years ago. Darmont has
the pull in a colossal kind of size, but womankind don’t
And any of the premiers good-looking, save Fleury, and
he only in modern costume.
Sara’s Melbourne repertoire is shorn after all, but people
appear to agree there will be a return visit, despite your
positively last and most positively last. So far it has
been ‘Camille,’ ‘Tosca,’ ‘Fedora,’ ‘Cleopatre,’ ‘Adrienne
Lecouvreur,’ ‘ Frou Frou,’ ‘Jeanne d’Arc,’ with ‘Theo-
dora,’ enough to carry her right through. Well, it is
really useless her acting anything so dry as the classic
‘ Phedre,’ though she may be perfect in it. Four of the
tragedies she played in Melbourne are by Sardou—
‘Camille’ is by Dumas; ‘Adrienne Lecouvreur,’ by
Scribe and Legouve; ‘ Frou Frou,’ by Meiihac and
Halevy ; and ‘Jeanne d’Arc,’ by Barbier.
Bernhardt is most generous taking her calls. Always
brings an actor on, even such as Munie, after his oire
scene as the Messenger, in “ Cleopatre.” Indeed, Munie
does that bit capitally, his irrepressible touches of terrified
humour being a welcome leaven.
The good stage memory will forget a part, but the bad
memory clings on to the greatest rubbish, like a limpet to
the rock, when once acquired.
French actors don’t wait forcues. They cut in, interrupt
the speech before its end, in the same natural way as you
do when talking. The dialogue in the Bernhardt plays is
a regular gabble, though the talking is beautifully
musical, almost operatic in its rhythm.
New York Times sketches J. A. Bailey, Barnum’s part-
ner. Was in Australia, with Cooper and Bailey’s show,
and worked up from an orphan farm-boy. The show made
money in Australia, but lost it in South America. Bailey
made a rise by buying Dockrill’s Circus, mortgaged to
Reilley, the ’Frisco show-printer, and Bailey got it for a
comparative song, whereupon he worked up such a rival
to Barnum as would have crushed that Bismarck had he
not overtured for partnership. For ten years Bailey has
managed the concern, Barnum being only a figurehead,
and Bailey bought Jumbo even without Barnum’s know-
ledge.
An old-time Victorian solicitor, now resident in Sydney,
pleasantly tells of a little experience he once had in the
dress-circle of the old Melbourne Royal. With his wife,
he occupied seats in the circle. Having to go out between
the acts, possibly to “see a man,” he naturally expected
to find his seat vacant when he returned, but he did not.
It was occupied by an individual who refused to leave.
The solicitor did not in this case consider possession nine
poiids of the law, but bundled the intruder neck-and-crop
out of the seat and down the stairs, in presence of the
ushers, who stood by without interfering. Result- an
action at law, in which the attorney got worsted, the
damages (£500) and costs amounting to upwards of £lOOO.
The seats were dear at the price.
, Old Jim Byers relates an amusing anecdote of his early
Australian sock.-and-buskin days. In the good times on
OulgougJim was doing “ Richelieu.” The luggage had
been delayed and Jim felt fixed. The hotel at which he
put up had a neat parlour, every chair in which was
adorned with an anti-maecassar. These Jim quietly
secured. The next visit the lady made to her parlour
she found all her treasures gone and immediately gave
information to the police. What was the astonishment of
landlady, police, and “pros.” to find Bulwer Lytton’s
clerical hero dressed from head to foot in anti-maccassars!
He had tacked them together and they passed off for the
lace robe usually worn by the representation of the
Cardinal. On another occasion he secured all the white
table-cloths as a toga for the noble Roman “ Virginius.”

Sara dislikes Cleopatre, but the public now swal
low it with avidity. The last night of “ Cleo
patre” was better than the first of “Adrienne

they only want to look at her in something which gratifies
the taste for novelty.
“Agitate! Agitate!” We have spoken of the trick of
waggling the proscenium door, to lash the gallery into
frenzy, and secure a call; and at the Melbourne Princess’s
they give a jickup to the lower fringe of the green plush
curtain, which is supposed to have the same effect.
Porel, manager of Paris Odeon, wants to marry his
leading actress, Mdlle. Rejane, hut here is the difficulty—
the house is State-suhventioned, and it will be with-

Apropos, an American manager once told us that he

The lordly Cartwright won’t submit to Brough and
Boucicault’s practice of chopping the first names off in

The French Troupe, Sara’s, are all agog over the

Lohr has been playing it very low down on the Maori"
landers. While ahead of Madame Patey he came across
a photograph of three infants—triplets—ranged in a row.
The happy father had bad them photographed with an
idea of claiming the “Queen’s bounty.” Since Lohr was
in Maoriland last ho has become a happy father, and
naturally there are many enquiries as to the youngster
and its ma. Lohr has had the Maori triplets transferred
to a Sydney' photographer’s card, and whenever any
Maoriland pressman inquires after the baby, he pulls the
card out from a pocket case, and with the beaming smile
of a happy father, says ; “Baby ! why', man, there’s three
of ’em!” The “genial one” is looked upon with awe
and respect in consequence. As the Maoris say, he is a
“ tangata kaha.”
Marian Burton, who has just come over to join the
Hallos, has been enjoying the drum cum dig. at Nathan’s
big house opposite Government House, Auckland. Water-
low is quite well, and so is baby, which is “so like paw.”
Williamson and Garner were never so astonished in
their lives as by the rush for seats for the Gaiety first
night. Nellie Barren and Leslie were not new - they had
been here lately, yet the furore surpassed that over Bern
hardt, and warranted Irving and Terry coming by next
boat. All this shows Melbourne to he unquenchable in
thirst for first-class stuff. Fancy- the Bald Brigade bat-
tering at the shop-shutters at seven a.m. !
Two features of the Bernhardt season are occupying the
minds of Melbourne theatre-goers, says a Melbourne cor-
respondent-one, the dreadful character of the imported
scenery which has marked her season, and the other the
marked absence of patronage from the vice-royalties who
are landed by the Austral Salon and endured by the hoi
polloi,
Joe Reynolds was 40 years at the London Britannia

Cruel. Thirteen years ago, as we have already noted)
Lord Desart divorced his wife, because of adultery with
Sugden, the actor, who married her, but now she has been
compelled to obtain a divorce from him. It is the story
of “ Frou Frou,” in real life, twice as painful, for the
actor acted with cruel heartlessness. Yet perhaps Desart
had trouble to make her go and see Sugden in the first
instance.

Tom Thorne, London manager, went with a friend to a

Barry Sullivan’s manner of speaking was very stilted,
but he does not seem to have been aware of the fact, as
he is said to have addressed to an actor the advice :
“ Speak naturally, sir, as Ido.” Once, when Pinero was
rehearsing a part not to Mr. Sullivan’s satisfaction, he
exclaimed: “Can’t you play it as I tell you, sir?” “ No,”
was the reply. “ I get 30s. a week ; if I could play it as
you tell me, I should want the same salary that you
have.”
According to London Figaro, Stanley is not the lion of

Sullivan, felicitously said (the adverb is Sydney Echo’s)
that “ Among our own people no one who has visited the
Greater Britain beyond the seas but must be alive to the
depth of feeling stirred by the first bar of ‘ God Save the
Queen.’ It is not too much to say that this air has done
more than any other single agency to consolidate the
national sentiment which forms the basis of our world-
wide empire.” Sir Arthur Solomon (who must have been
stuffed by his friend, Composer Cohen) is a prevaricator.
When Australia can’t get away from “God Save” it

When is Brough and Boucicault’s “ Much Ado about

In “The Scout,” at Melbourne Alexandra, a great mis-

John L. Sullivan says that Edwin Booth is the greatest
Shakespearean actor that ever lived, and yet he couldn’t
make money in England, because the English said “he
aint like ’Enery Hirving.” Therefore, Johnel, who says
he makes from 1500 to 2000 dollars weekly, ain t going to
England, though he drew better at Baltimore than Booth
and Barrett, but sailed for Australia the other day.
Says Hawk: —“The Gilbert-Oellier combination has been
irretrievably broken up. It happened in this way.
Cellier, when travelling with B. C, Stephenson in Aus-
tralia, received his libretto from Gilbert, and on perusing
it discovered that the locale was similar to that of one he
was doing with Stephenson. He wrote this fact to
Gilbert. The answer was a telegram, short, though
perhaps, none too sweet: ‘Return my libretto at once.
Gilbert.’ ”

The title, “The Infant Mozart”—it always suggests
“ The Boy Politician ” —was suggested by James Smith,
of the Arhus. J.S. then held a transmigration-of-soul
sort of belief (one of his notions was that his own son had
received the soul of the Redeemer), and it was revealed
to him that the soul of Mozart inhabited the body of the
child Hutcheson. The subsequent conduct of his own
progeny (a very good fellow, by the way) suggested to
him that there must be a flaw somewhere in his reason-
ing, and he holds the belief no longer.
Ernest Hutcheson once found a “refuge and a home”
at R. S. Smythe’s, who thought of educating the “ young
Mozart.” One morning, however, upon getting up for
his morning stroll, about 1 p.m., the “Much-Travelled”
discovered that his front newly-painted garden-wall was
stencilled from one end to the other, in letters 9in. long,
“The Infant Mozart Lives Here.” This, the work of an
irate father, was too much for even R.S.S., who instaoter
transferred his charge to tub-thumper Torrance.
Alluding to the independent attitude assumed
by a growing Democracy, Francis Abigail,
it is said, once remarked in his Ministerial
days ; “ It's all along o’ this ’ere manhood
suffrage, tho’, of course, one durs’n’t say
so on the ’listings.” The latest stride made
by Labour is, however, not only a conse-
quence of manhood suffrage, but of payment
of members a measure whose existence
is now deeply regretted by the Employers’
Union, who state, of course, that it has
ushered into Parliamentary life a number
of men whose chief desire is the salary
attached to the position of M.L.A. This
is even less true than it would be to say
that Premier Parkes’ tenure of office is
prompted solely by a thirst for pay. The
Labour-candidates did not put up/op the £3OO,
but because of it ; had it not existed they could
not have offered their honest services to their
fellows, and if there be one cogent reason for
the introduction of payment of members it is
that affords working men and poor men an
opportunity ot representing men who are also
working-men and also poor men. Of course the
enemies of democracy are prepared to style
these “Representatives of Humanity ” —as
someone designated them during the elections —
presumptuous, unintellectual, uncultured ; but,
judging from what we’ve seen and heard,
should the labour-party move solidly and
quietly, they will, not only as a party but as
individuals, compare favourably in all points
with the other parties and their components —
and more than favorably with the men whom
they have displaced.

It is quite an open question whether an elective Upper
House on a property franchise is better than a nominee
Chamber. As nominees, councillors are really nobodies ;
but if elected they might claim co-equal powers with the
popular House “Peter Pickle”; You make a mis'
take. The Bulletin believes in and advocates National
Protection ; it also rejoices heartily over, and is presump-
tuous enough to believe that it shares in, the success of
the new labourcandklates, whose causeithas foryearsdoue
its best to support. At the same time The Bulletin is an
absolutely independent paper, on which no party or
politician has any kind of lien, financial or moral. The
Bulletin would like to have seen the labour-party com-
pletely carry South Sydney—if that’s what you allude t 0
—and believes that this end would have been quite
attained had the labour-party not committed ail error of
judgment in splitting its vote by nominating unknown
men against men whose votes and speeches have marked
them as among the most effective advocates of the
proletarian cause. This paper comes out for the purpose
of enabling us to say every week just what we choose to
say, and not what anybody else chooses us to say, and

The mutilated body of Commander Lew-
ington, of the N.S.W. Naval Forces, was found
strewn on the railway-line at Hurstville, near
Sydney, on Saturday night. The matter is

mander had any reason for travelling in the
direction of Hurstville.
A certain young man whose legitimacy
was questioned stood for Parliament, and, at a
meeting, was asked who and what his father was.
Without moving a muscle, he replied ; “ As it is a
wise child, my friend, who knows his own father,
lam not sure about my father. However, lam
sure my mother is a lady ; she is known as a lady
to all hereabouts. If you dispute this, come up
here.” He was elected.
S.M. Herald prints an article which
means, if it means anything, that in re-distri-

there was nothing the matter with the N.S.W.
constituencies as at present arranged until their
aggregate vote panned out against the Calico-
Jemmies.
Some two years ago the block of laud on
which a certain palatial building stands was
occupied by 12 small red-brick hovels, always in a
sad state of repair. This nice property was not
seldom in the police-reports as “ the lowest part
of Melbourne.” Eleven out of the 12 were
notorious dens of vice. The rout was collected
for years by the man at the corner cottage, and
taken once a fortnight down to the office of—well,
the partners were both stars in the religious and
temperance world-and the same question was
always asked : “ Was he sure there were no bad
characters living in the row?” The man knew
his cards and answered: “No, certainly not.”
And so the farce went on until the row was con-
demned, and at boom-time was sold for a small
fortune. Of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.

On Monday night the N.S.W. labour-party
had captured 18 Ministerial seats and had only
taken four Protectionist seats. Included in the
18 were 16 of the most servile and useful votes
that any government ever had. Parkes could
have counted on them to lynch the Queen with-
out a trial. The labour-party have now also
annexed the two new seats at Hartley and New-
town.
Rabbi Davis, as the head ecclesiastic of
(we believe) longest standing in N.S.W., should
have religious precedence at Government House,
Sydney. We would advise Governor Jersey to
adopt this suggestion in the interest of future
Governors who may not be so well off as the head
of Child’s bank. We have already seen at least
one N.S.W. Governor who would have been glad
of the influence of the Rabbi.
The Bulletin has always felt that the
plural vote was a great force, but it never, until
the present N.S.W. general election, had the
slightest idea of how great that force was. Look
at the case of Central Cumberland. For that out-
side constituency there was a polling-place in the
city at which nearly one thousand votes were
recorded ! In other words, nearly a thousand
allotments cast their weight against the flesh and
blood of resident voters.
United labour has shown its strength at
the N.S. W. general elections by returning up to
date 24 candidates out of the 86 elected. If such
things be done in the green leaf what may not be
done in the dry ? One has to consider not only
the weakening of the monopolistic side by the
abolition of plural voting but also the strengthen-
ing of the workers by the addition, under a system
of registration of voters, of perhaps 40,000 or
50,000 enfranchised nomad electors.
At Melbourne, a young “ praste ” in
embryo, who has not yet completed his appren-
ticeship, and who owns much coin, which was
ultimately destined for the Church, has thrown
oyer divinity for the Divine, and announced
his intention of following Sara to the end of the
earth. The Pope’s local representative for-
warded him a bull, a pastoral, and an encyclioal
in quick succession, which he converted into fuel.
The Church seems at present to stand a very fair
; show of “ getting left.”
The Australian “ Plimsoll-mark ” is a thing
to be scoffed at. It is a mere whim—a variable
line rising or falling according to the caprice of
ship-owners and the helplessness or careless in-
difference of crews. It is a fact well-known to
the present writer from personal observation that
colliers come constantly to Sydney with their
bulwarks but a few inches above water, and that
they almost invariably prefer to sneak up the
harbour at night. Not many days ago, one such
collier, loaded chin-deep in a choppy sea, broke
her steering-gear, and had a miraculous escape
from foundering oft Botany Heads.
The higher education of woman, writes a
nasty, wicked Melbourne correspondent, is likely
to receive a fresh impetus at the ball to be given
by the Austral Salon, where the followers of the
cult of Aspasia will have an opportunity of im-
proving on the lesson in dress, taught at their late
amateur trouble. The ball will be plain and
fancy—that is, the women will be plain, and the
greater portion of the dress will be left to the
fancy of the spectator, since it seems that the
primary step in the elevation of women will be
to elevate her petticoats as far above the ankles as
possible.
From an English paper :
A most pathetic little scene was enacted the other day
in the Guardians’ committee-room at Huddersfield, of all
places in the world. A woman, evidently in the depth of
poverty—she looked as if she had never known what it was
to have enough to eat—entered the room and presented the
Guardians with fifty pounds. The intense delight and
pride on the woman’s face as she did so, was beyond
description. Years ago, it seems, her father had fallen
into evil days, and been obliged to accept parish relief.
The woman had calculated that, in all, he had received
fifty pounds, and she worked night and day to save the
money, and thus remove the stain of pauperdom from her
father’s memory. Think of the misery, the pinching, the
starving, that £5O represents; for the donor is a char-
woman, who rarely earns more than eight shillings a
week. The Guardians were most unwilling to accept the
money, but the woman insisted upon doing so ; for she
could not rest, she said, so long as the money remained
unpaid.
The cable humbug states that Sir W.
Gordon-0 umming has been joyously received by
his tenantry, who are unanimously convinced of
his innocence. This looks a nice old feudal item,
but the average agricultural tenant is so utterly
bankrupt that his one hope lies in getting his rent
reduced, and how much reduction would have
been granted to the tenant who didn’t unanim-
ously believe Sir W. Gordon-Oumming to bo
innocent? Not much, we should bet, for even if
Gumming be not a card-sharper, he is a man with
two surnames joined together by a hyphen, and an
individual like that is capable of anything. And, in
spite of that, it is three chances to one that it was
only the tenants who gathered together and cheered
who were “unanimous,” and the tenants who
stayed away weren’t unanimous at all. Also it
doesn’t matter a cent in any case, and the whole
affair doesn’t amount to any more than a dog-
fight.
London Hawk strongly advises hostesses
to keep out of their houses males of this type ;
Generally young, or aping juvenility, elaborately over-
dressed, with floured faces and flowered coats, nearly
always clean shaved, with pencilled eyebrows, and
greased and scented hair, elaborate lingerie, bejewelled
and gloved hands, bangles and big ties, and always an air
of doing something, playing and composing a little, sing-
ing a little, painting—sometimes themselves—a little,
designing a little, and generally dabbling with any art but
that of self-defence. They generally hang about in
groups, and irritate one to almost hitting them by their
squeaky voices and the kangaroo or squirrel-like fashion
in which they use their little paw-like hands. The few
poor women they associate with they always address in a
Platonic sort of way, and speak of them as “such n
dear,” or “ quit e a sweet person,” but generally they have
lit tic good-feeling for women, and occasionally speak of
them as if they owed them a personal spite. This class of
social horror is never heard to use strong language,
and lias an unnatural objection to a coarse story or a
sailor-like expression, and his name is seldom associated
with that of a woman in a scandal. lie is generally
detested by men who were disgusted at his finnikin ways,
his falsetto voice, his ring-scrawled hands, and the indes-
cribable something which makes manly men’s flesh creep
and feel an inclination to kick something very hard.
This kind of man may also be seen in Australia.

Advt. from Mauritius Moniteur :
A STAMP COLLECTOR, the possessor of a collection,
of 12,541 stamps, wishes to marry a lady who is
an ardent collector and the possessor of the blue
penny stamp of Mauritius, issued in 1847.
That stamp, by the way, is said to be worth some
hundreds of pounds.
A certain N.S.W. parson just “up the
line ” from Sydney coin plains that he is called by
his people “at peculiar hours of the night” to
celebrate marriages. Out of nearly 120 marriages
at which he has officiated in the town, 29 took
place between midnight and six o’clock in the
morning.
There are eight single-taxers among the
N.S.W. Labour members. However, it must be
remembered that they have been elected on the
labour and not on the pure single-tax ticket.
Single-taxers are nothing if not enthusiastic, and
it is reasonable to suppose that each member
polled every single-tax vote in his constituency.
The statement that a live Australian
Governor is to be a witness in a double-barrelled
divorce-case, to be heard in England, refers to
Gov. Carington, who “unwittingly afforded the

It was last week cabled that ex-Lord
Mayor Isaacs, of London, had resigned his alder-
manship owing to having been connected with
certain “unfortunate” companies during his
mayoral terra. One of these was the Anglo-
Austrian Printing and Publishing Union, which,
after getting £93,000 out of the public with which
no trace of business of any kind had been done,
wound up with a balance of 25 guineas on its
books.
A Melbourne caterer has a quarrel with a
big Southern corporation, which, during the strike,
hired him to feed blacklegs, and, so he says, told
him to spare no expense. Taking them at their
word, he stoked the “free ” labourers with turkey
and truffles ; now the employers refuse to pay on
the stuffed-turkey scale. “ Men may laugh and
riot till the feast is o’er ; then comes the reckoning
and they laugh no more.”
In 1 homas C. O’Mara, barrister-at-law,
whe died of consumption at Burwood, Sydney, on
Tuesday morning last, Australia has lost one of
her brightest, most eloquent and most loveable
sons. When once Mr. O’Mara took up a question
in earnest no one who has ever stood on our soil
could be more eloquent with tongue or pen. That
nervous disposition which is so often allied to
quick perception and brilliant mental gifts was
physically his curse.
In Melbourne Public library are some
rough carven idols (from New Ireland). On a
certain reverend evangelist seeing them he rushed
straight to the trustees, and at last, to stop his
tongue, the idols were put in frocks, much to the
amusement of visitors. Last week three small
boys were seen down on their knees trying to
unhitch the frocks and see what sort of knees the
wooden gods were endowed with. This comes of
dressing idols.
The snagging-boats were working near
Hay. The Court was being held. The day, to
say the least of it, was hot, and so was the judge’s
temper. A half-drunken snagger rolled in and,
lifting his hat, saluted his honor with, “Hello,
Charley, how are you?” “Remove that man,”
thundered the judge. When he was being re-
moved the drunk was heard to say: “Damn
queer, can’t speak to one’s own brother but get
lumbered.” That night two men in a hurry took
the track to the river. They looked like police-
men. Next morning the snagging-boats were
miles up the stream.
Rev. Ralph Brown, well-known and
respected in Melbourne, is better known as
“ Jockey Brown the Parson.” When he lived at
Preston he came to town across country, and the
stranger seeing the flying parson would think, by
the appearance of his nag and himself, that he
had been for a doctor. The Rev. R, B. is a combi-
nation of professions, and how he keeps them all
going is wonderful. He saves souls, teaches
shorthand and a system of mnemonics, is a
phrenologist and thought-reader, and acts as
builder and architect to his own denomination.
Some of his spare time is filled in by attending
local option and mothers’ meetings.
A young Pentridge prisoner, under three
years’ sentence, the other day tried to hang him-
self. The visiting P.M. thereupon sentenced him
to twelve months’ additional gaol and fourteen
days’ solitary confinement ! We ask logical people
to consider well this sentence, and then say
whether anything more gratuitously brutal and
useless and senseless can ever have been done by
King Theebaw of Burmah, or King Coffee Oalcali
of Dahomey, or that Maiiipuri potentate who
lately roasted two live prisoners before a slow
fire? What is the Australian medical profession
about that it doesn’t rise up as one man to pro-
test against such insane savagery?

POLITICAL POINTS
A Murray “ Cod."—Albury as the Federal
Capital.
The political motto of the Labour Party :
“ Support in return for concessions.”
New York Tribune says Australia is
following exactly in the line of the United States.
Parkes’ sudden affection for One-Man-
One-Vote is Circean. Ho affects to love it that he
may destroy it.
Frawncis Abigail’s trade knowledge will
now, we presume, be utilised in the “ Upper ”
House.
Without an exception that The Bulletin
knows of, the new N.S.W. Labour members are
good Republicans.
B. R, Wise champions M‘Millan’s budget.
But he fights shy of allusions to Macmillan's
Magazine.
The “ privilege ” of Australian Property
will, in the near future, be not to exercise plui’ai
votes but to pay plural taxes.
We take the Federal Convention as an
instalment, a kind of sketch, outline, or tracery,
useful in its humble way.
Twenty-five members of the late N.S.W-
Legislative Assembly have voluntarily retired
from political life. Many more have been and
will be hustled out,
A Victorian : “ Glorious is the news of
the N.S.W. elections. The old time comes o’er
us, that of Charles Jardine Don and Richard
Heales.”
The brightest feature of the N.S.W.
general elections is the manner in which the old
sectarian feuds have been sunk by the workers.
Exit the Parkes pig-vote party.
Parkes boasted that his Government would
obtain 48 of the 53 seats contested on the first
day of the N.S.W, general elections. As a matter
of fact, they only secured 23.
()ne of the elect of East Sydney paid £5O
for the composition of his election-speeches.
That he had a lesson to repeat was patent to all
who heard his parrot-like utterances.
We notice in the suddenly-awakened
Sydney daily papers that “Labour is King.”
Now. Labour is not King, but he is going to be
President of the United Australian Republic.
“ The Australian Federation Conference,”
remarks an English paper, “adopted the word
Commonwealth perhaps with an eye to a Lord
Protector in the shape of Sir Henry Parkes.”
More than one candidate at the N.S.W-
general election is that sort of Englishman, who*
considering the general views of this island’s
population, could not conscientiously represent
any Australian constituency.
Paris correspondent of the Times says
that there are five million Jews in Russia, who,
with the capacity for increase that characterises
the race, may grow to exceed, in forty years, the
orthodox population of Russia.
Glen Innes (N.S.W.) gaol, which cost
£11,300, probably loan-money, is utterly useless.
It was built as the result of log-rolling on the part
of local residents. It has not been used, and is
rotting away in the charge of a caretaker.
“Cocky” Burns, Parkes’ ex-Treasurer’
rejected by St. Leonards, was for nearly 30 con-
secutive years a member of the N.S.W. Legislative
Assembly. His political death is chiefly ascrib-
able to the fact that he dared oppose one-man-one-
vote.
Of course Australia doesn’t trouble itsel f
much -about the Anglo-Italian alliance, but i fc
would like to know what is the immoral considera-
tion given by Italy for such a guarantee as that
the British Mediterranean Fleet is to defend the
Italian ports?
Thus Greater Britain : “ ‘ Common-
wealth’ is a good—a very good—mouthful, but it
is not a xvord that commends itself much to
English ears or English ideas, in that Common-
wealth means ‘ any state of government other
than a Monarchy.’ ”
Parkes will offer the N.S.W. labour-
members their political price, but he will tender
it in promissory-notes. If they demand cash, he will
offer to pay them in counterfeit money. There are
m the world some persons with whom it is danger-
ous to do business at all.
Seven would-be legislators dropped their
deposits at the Tasmanian general elections. For
instance, the four candidates for West Devon (one
seat) polled thus :—M‘Call, 531; Aieock, 88;
Button, 67; Fogg, 51. So far, six N.S. Wales
candidates are similarly situated.
Parkes has told a Melbourne interviewer
that the N.S.W. Labour Party is “quite a sur-
prise to him.” He thinks, however, that “it will
be impossible for them to act together in the work
of legislation as a body.” How then did the
Parkes party act together as a body?
“ Sir Henry Parkes went on to say that ho
viewed the victories of the N.S.W. labour-candi-
dates with great pleasure.” Then why did he and
bis Government oppose their candidature? The
labour-party recognise slime when they see it
dribbling from the mouth of the snake.
The Prahran (Melb.)branch of the A.N.A.
has chosen a major in the Mounted Rifles as the
new president. Majahs at the head of a so-called
national movement! Why, the A.N.A. will end
up by being a standing army, or a secret society
of special constables, sworn to stop everything
save their own tongues.
Owing to the recent election to S.A.
Legislative Council of eight new members, there
is now an absolute majority in that Chamber
favouring Corporation and District Councils
assessing on unimproved land-values. The
Assembly for three years sent the Bill up to the
Council,- each time to be rejected.
On the meeting of N.S.W. Parliament
some member should table an enquiry as to how
much if anything extra over contract-price the
N.S.W. Treasury has to pay for inscribing the,
politically defunct O’Connor’s name on Sydney
General Post-office clock bell. Of this the country
may be quite sure : the inscription was not carved
out of O’Connor’s own .brass.
The Marquis of Salisbury, then Lord
Robert Cecil, writing in the Saturday Review in
61, declared that “Englishmen’ssympathies must
necessarily be with the Southern States ” (in the
American Civil war) “ because the Southerners
were asserting their rights as citizens of sovereign
states.” If Salisbury is alive when an Australian
State or States attempts to secede from our Com-
monwealth, what will lie say then ?
There is at least one of the transportation
Acts of George IV.’s reign unrepealed. If N.S.W.
Government ever follows the Queensland example
and attempt to enforce some of the Georgian
statutes, The Bulletin may take into considera-
tion the advisableness of instituting a case or two
under that particular unrepealed measure. If it
does, there will be trouble, especially as it is in
doubt whether 60 years’ possession of land adverse
to the Crown is a good title.
The London Tory Press’ objection to the
appointment of Michael Davitt to the British
Labour Commission resolves itself into the asser-
tion that the Queen could not address “a Repub-
lican and a Fenian” as her “trusty and well-
beloved ”! Which is simply an argument not for
THE LOGICAL ALTERNATIVE.
FISHMONGER: “I say; whistle your dog.”
OWNER OF DOG: “Ugh, what? You’d better whistle your crab.”
shutting out the brave and pure Davitt, but for
shutting down upon a lying form of words which
is a relic of Bastard Bill and his “trusty and
well-beloved ” gang of cut-throats and land-
thieves.
Melbourne Age remarks, in re the Labour
successes at the polls, that the N.S.W. people
have determined to take the control of public
affairs into their own hands, and once and forever
end Government by the little squatting and im-
porting ring. “ Young Australia,” it adds, “ has
come to the front, and has supplanted in power
the imported population, who have been so easily
misled by appeals to insular prejudices, and who
have been indifferent to the politics of their
adopted country.”
As The Bulletin predicted, the Labour
candidates unnecessarily nominated for the
already democratically-represented South Sydney
constituency, spoilt the election in the democratic
interest. They occupied places at the bottom of
the poll—between 900 and 1100 votes behind the
number recorded for Traill, who was returned at
the top, B. R. Wise being second and well up.
The verdict of the electors thus coincides with
that of this paper, given in advance. The ill-
judged action of the Labour Party has lost for the
present to the democratic interest the services of
that able young lawyer, Walter Edmunds.
“ Inasmuch as,” says the S.E. Chronicle,
“the Australian Commonwealth has followed in
a general way the lines of the Constitution of the
United States, it is reasonable to suppose that the
separation from Great Britain will be followed
by the adoption of a Republican form of govern-
ment. No reason is apparent why it should not
succeed as well in Australasia as in America, and
the dawn of the coming century may very likely
see the Australian Commonwealth a Republic—
free, independent and indivisible. Australia has
been in leading strings so long her people do not
realise how strong they are. Now that she has
struck out for herself she is bound to go.”
The Sydney press is divided in its ideas as
to the fiscal faith of the N.S.W. Labour Party.
One section hails them as Freetraders ; another as
Protectionists. As a matter of fact, the bulk of
them have no belief in cither policy. They argue
that whether wealth bo largely acquired in ex-
change for products externally manufactured, or
created chiefly by internal manufacture, that
neither the so-called Freetrade of N.S. Wales or
the Protection of Victoria can ensure the worker
an equitable division of the results of his labour,
or wipeout the unemployed difficulty by throwing
open national resources and opportunities for pro-
duction to all desirous of using them. That being
so, they intend to maintain an armed neutrality.
Sydney Echo remarks that the written
promises of the N.S.W. labour-members to resign
when called upon to do so by a two-thirds majority
of the labour-committee “are no more binding
than a will, which can be revoked or altered at
any time. These candidates can give a written
promise to some other party to the effect that
they will not resign until they are compelled, and
the later promise will effectually revoke the
earlier one.” The labour-party will no doubt feel
greatly obliged for this, frank outburst of Echo
political morality. It is worthy of the political
regime under which the Echo was educated-
under which cheques secretly marked with pin-
holes to show that they were not meant to be
paid, were issued to the creditors of certain poli-
ticians.
'Nine out of ten of the British comments
on the failure of the Victorian loan draw the
deduction that the “collapse of Protection” was
responsible for the failure, and sundry patriotic
magnates of the Sydney commercial world whose
study of economic literature is confined to West-
garth’s Circular and the Sydney Morning
Herald money-article—the weakest thing of the
kind in all Australasia—have not been slow to
parrot the cry. Not one of the moralists, how-
ever, has had the candour to admit that the
public debt per head in Victoria is £9 per head
less than it is in N.S.W.; or that the true cause
of thecollapse of Australian loans is simply that the
big syndicates have either gone bung or are on
the eve of going. The Baring catastrophe riddled
most of the syndicates to disappearing-point.
The Australasian’s Sydney correspondent
remarks that “Federation is in the air” and is
certain to prove a great “bone of contention.”
The Bulletin doesn’t want to be too critical
about this, as the correspondent is doubtless a
well-tailored and harmless individual, but it is
unwise to have a bone up in the air at any time,
and it devoutly hopes that the great Freetrade
party has tied a string to the end of it so as to
haul it down when it is wanted. Besides, the
metaphor isn’t up to much, for Parkes never
worries about bones —it is meat he is hunting
after. And, anyhow, the proceeding ought to bo
discouraged, for a party that has a bone in the
atmosphere will presently be found depositing
grease on the bright lexicon of youth, or it will
try to dig up the white flower of a blameless life
with the sabre of its sires, or something of the
sort. There should be a law against “ the great
Freetrade party” using figures of speecli—the}'
always come to a disastrous end somehow.
Bruce Smith’s election for the Glebe is
quoted as a victory for the conservative side by the
Sydney daily press. Now, no less than 500 plural
votes were recorded in the Glebe, of which, it
cannot be doubted, 90 per cent, were recorded for
Mr. Smith, who nevertheless after all only suc-
ceeded in beating labour-candidate Houghton by
seven votes ! As to M‘Millan’s victory, what can
be expected in East Sydney, the home of plural
voting? After all, the labour-candidate, working-
stonemason Grantham, polled 2241 single votes
against M’Millan’s 3713, the latter being sup-
ported by all the wealth of Sydney and the entire
daily press, which, sofarasweean see, did noton any
one occasion squarely report asingle utterance from
the labor-candidate’s lips. The Bulletin pre-
dicts that when the plural votes of the clubs, &c.,
shall have been struck off the electoral-roll East
Sydney will return at least one labour-candidate
every time.
The Eight Hours Anniversary Committee,
of Melbourne, have voted £l2O of their last
surplus to the local hospitals.

pires, is only fit for taking out in very fine weather.

“Granny ” and her “ Echo.”*
Granny, cuddled in her chair,
(So the oracles aver)
Thus her spirit did declare
To the bantling at her beck, O—
“ Sit, my babe, upon my knee
Listen mutely unto me
While I sketch my past to thee.”
“Cuckoo, cuckoo,” quoth the Echo.
“ First of all I wish to make
This remark—it’s for your sake —
From my past your pattern take,
If you wish to work a ‘ spec.,’ O
F’ollow me, and, through and through,
Copy everything I do ;
Be, in short, my own cuckoo.”
“Cuckoo, cuckoo,” quoth the Echo,
“ Long before I made a name,
I, desirous of the same,
Hit upon a certain aim,
Kept my conscience well in check, 0—
Since I hit it, night and day,
Cash I’ve made the shortest way.
Child, remember all 1 say.”
“ Cuckoo, cuckoo,” quoth the Echo.
“ What is life? Its full amount
Is not worth a printer’s fount
If you have no bank-account—
Cannot sit and draw your cheque, O.
Home this lesson I would bring ;
Sling your faith—your honour sling—
Money— money’s everything !”
“Cuckoo, cuckoo,” quoth the Echo.
“ Knowing this I’ve kept in sight
Money morning, noon and night—
Neither swerving left nor right,
Brazen face and stiffened neck, O.
With a heart as hard as flint
Coin I’ve got by every dint—
Baby, will you take the hint?”
“Cuckoo, cuckoo,” quoth the Echo.
“ To improve my pocket’s health
I’ve been found by steps of stealth
F’awniug at the feet of Wealth
Like a filthy-featured gecko.J
Child, remember when you’re big,
Toady even w retched ‘ prig ’
If he have a broad-cloth ‘ rig.’ ”
“Cuckoo, cuckoo,” quoth the Echo.
“ Knowing how Religion pays,
I have walked in ‘ pious ’ ways,
Like a Pecksniff all my days—
Snowy choker round my neck, O.
Baby, now a sprouting root,
If you wish to come to fruit,
Don’t forget a ‘ godly ’ suit.”
“Cuckoo, cuckoo,” quoth the Echo.
“ Year by year I laboured hard
Social progress to retard—
If it didn’t suit my card
World and all might go to wreck, O
Still if any progress came,
1 to kudos laid a claim—
Bantling, you must do the same.”
“ Cuckoo, cuckoo,” quoth the Echo.
“ Men of genius, what are they?
Scholars ?—do their writings pay ?
These are rubbish, in the way,
Names of no use on a cheque, O !
Chicken, if you see about
Clever fellow on the scout,
Try like me to snuff hiin out.”
“ Cuckoo, cuckoo,” quoth the Echo.
“ Here I finish ! Wipe your nose.
Never tread on Mammon’s toes,
Hang your conscience ! —keep your clothes,
Parson-patterned, free of speck, O.
If you wish success to find
Ail that I have thus consigned
Carry, baby, in your mind.”
“ Cuckoo, cuckoo,” quoth the Echo.

Patrick Lenehan Feeney got drunk on a
recent night and was still so unsober on arising to
go to work that he put on his trousers back-to-
front. While ascending the ladder with a load of
bricks he fell, and great was the fall thereof.
Pat’s comrades surrounded him and asked with
sympathy in their voices, “ Are yez hurt ? ”
Phadrig, catching sight of the position of his
unmentionables, replied in feeble tones: “No
bhoys, but oi’ve got a divil of a twisht.”
An emperor doesn’t look well when he
is upside-down. The other day the German boss
potentate was about Mi conduct a review from the
deck of a torpedo-boat, the troops being ranged
along the river bank. He fixed himself in a
haughty and noble attitude, with one leg slightly
in advance of the other, and his breast-bone
thrown out to such an extent that it looked as if
he had a bag of coal inside his waistcoat, and his
sword held high up in the air above his head.
Then the boat gave a heave, and as he was already
tottering and nearly bursting with the tre-
mendous strain of his kingly attitude, that
finished him. His legs flew out like an enraged
fowl and his sword went somewhere twenty yards
away, and he clutched the air with both hands
and vanished into the bottom of the boat. They
found him there swearing violently and with his
helmet smashed down over his eyes, and lifted
him up, for his military pants were so tight that
he couldn’t I'ise without assistance. Then his
helmet was put straight, and somebody lent him
another sword, his own being at the bottom of the
river, and he resumed the attitude of majestic
approbation as before.

an UMBRELLA STORY.
It was the Barings who had, perforce, to
put the screw on Wales, over Sandringham, and
he raised £300,D00 somewhere, or quieted the
creditors somehow, though Hirsch proved a broken
reed. “My dear fellow, I’ve got poor Ithrael to

Lady Hopetoun is still rather delicate,
we fear. She patronised Melbourne Anglican
Cathedral the other Sunday morning, but after
about fifteen minutes of worship her ladyship
drew herself together and hastily got out of it.
Cold tabernacle doesn’t seem to suit her constitu-
tion.
A Melbourne evening paper mentions as
an item of news that Sir Bryan O’Loghlen and
Daniel O’Connell were at school together. This
reminds us indirectly of the remark that John
Haynes made to Henry YIII. when they were
boys together. We can’t remember what the
remark was, but it doesn’t matter.
Governor Hopetoun, of Victoria, judging
from recent English revelations, is a subscriber to
a “British and Foreign Association,” which, for
the sum of half-a-guinea, will issue to members
letters of introduction to other members, in what-
ever country-resident, “which shall secure the
bearer hospitality and social recognition.”

knew him well. He started the first evening
paper in Maoriland.
J. A. Northmore, who died in Adelaide
last week, was one of the best-known men in
S. Australia. Although a broker and ex-mer-
chant, he was a born newspaper man, and attracted
much attention by his able articles when the
Protectionist policy of S. Australia was being
formulated. He had a remarkable memory and a
singularly caustic style.
A correspondent takes the trouble to in-
form Pall Mall Gazette that James M‘Kinley,
of Melbourne, “is not a Scotchman, but an Irish-
man.” Now, we have tried to read Melbourne
Punch, run by Mr. M‘Kinley aforesaid, for a
number of years, and have no hesitation in
declaring that if Mr. M'Kinley be not a Scotch-
man, he ought to be one.
“No one,” said Andrew Kelly, offering
thanks to the West Sydney electors for his return
as a labor M.P., “ will ever see Andy Kelly in a
top-hat.” In future soft hats will be known as
“ Andy Kelly’s ” —and the Sydney hatters must
be a slow lot if one of their number fails to
register a slouch felt at the Patents-office as “ The
Andy Kelly ” within an hour of The Bulletin’s
publication.
Here is how Sara Bernhardt plays with
her marvellous constitution. On Saturday she
rehearses “Adrienne Lecouvreur ” in the morn-
ing, acts “Cleopatra” in the afternoon, and
again in the evening; and directly after the per-
formance is off to Lilydale, 20 miles from the
city, where they report her passing through at
four o’clock on Sunday morning, with a party for
the Black Spur!
Moore Dillon, a former N.S.W. Crown
solicitor, was, like John Williams, noted for good
sayings. The then Clerk of the Peace, Mr.
Moore, had lost one of his organs of vision, and
for appearance sake wore an artificial substitute.
Dillon was on his way to Moore’s office one day
when a friend met him and asked where he was
going. “O,” said Dillon, “I am just off to con-
sult the oracle of Adel phi.”
None of the great financial houses of
Rothschilds are believed to be in the impregnable
position they occupied 20 years ago. The
financial ability of the old barons who have died
off is not maintained in their successors, and the
personal expenditure of the family gets more
extravagant as their c6ups become smaller and lews
frequent. Gilbert, in one of his patter songs,
coupled the names of Rothschild and Baring.
Baring’s wealth has vanished.
The present Emperor of Germany attributes
his perennial sore ear and withered hand to his
connection with “ those scrofulous Guelphs,” but,
perhaps, not with absolute justice. His paternal
grandmother, the Empress Augusta, was a grand-
daughter of the Emperor Paul of Russia, a
horrible mass of disease and a congenital lunatic.
So that a taint of scrofula and hereditary dunder-
headedness are all the ills he can fairly lay at the
door of Her Gracious of England.
“Why,” asks an Australian, writing in
Greater Britain, “does Mr. Stead single out
Mr. Parnell and Sir Charles Dilkc, and say ‘ You
are unfit for public life on account of your private
life,’ and pat the politician on the back whom be
calls the G. O. M. of Australia ? I cannot suppose
such favouritism arises from anything else than
ignorance; but such ignorance respecting our
statesmen and the others who form our colonial
Cabinet Councils makes us smile in the colonies.”
Disraeli is generally said to have been very
mean. “ Years ago I was at High Wycombe,”
writes an English newspaper correspondent,
“ and went into a local grocer’s. The proprietor
was in a great rage, and turning round exclaimed:
‘What do you think of that for a member of
Parliament ? See that half cheese ! It has just
been returned from Mr. Disraeli; as he is going
to London he does not need the remaining half of
a cheese I sent him three weeks ago, and he
wishes the value of this piece deducted from his
bill ? ’ ”
General Smidt, the conqueror in the fight
at Majuba Hill, was lately on tour through Natal,
and was invited by the officers of the British
garrison at Pietermaritzburg to dine with them.
He is described as a “plain-featured, portly
Dutch farmer, with long, black beard, slightly
streaked with grey, attired in black morning coat,
greyish ‘ slop ’ trousers, guiltless of straps, elastic-
side boots, a soft felt hat on his head, and in his
mouth a big briarwood pipe, from which issued
volumes of smoke of the pungent character pecu-
liar to Boer tobacco.”
Sir William Gordon-Cumming has been
formally sacked from the British Army, and the
Queen advertises in the Gazette that she has nc
further need for his services. Now, if Camming
has one scrap of energy about him he will reply by
advertising that he has no further use for the
Queen or Wales or any other member of the Royal
Family, and that they are no longer in his em-
ployment, and are not authorised to represent him
in any way, and that he won’t be responsible for
any liabilities they may incur on his behalf unless
authorised by his signature.
In one of his early cases, the audacity
which has always distinguished “ Jack ” Want in
court was displayed most effectively. The case
having been called, the young barrister said, in
the usual way, “let notice be given.” “In what
paper?” was the enquiry of the grey-haired clerk
of the court. Mr. Want mentioned some out-of-
the-way paper. “I don’t know such a paper,”
said the clerk disdainfully. “ Don't interrupt
the court proceedings, Mr. Clerk,” said J.W.,
“ for if you begin to tell us what you don’t know,
there will be no time for anything else.”
Samson Fox, of Leeds, lias become a
millionaire by his invention of corrugated boiler-
flues. Howe, the sewing-machine inventor, de-
rived £lOO,OOO a year from his chief invention, and
the author of Singer’s sewing-machine left a for-
tune of nearly £3,000,000 sterling. The inventor
of india-rubber tips at the end of lead-pencils
made £20,000 out of the scheme, and the man who
invented metal plates for wear as boot-protectors
got a quarter of a million of money out of it. The
patentee of the roller-skate made £200,000, and the
inventor of the common needle-threader derived
an income of £2OOO a year.
Humour and pathos are strangely blent in
the story recently told by a contemporary of how
that volatile young lawyer and politician, W. P.
Crick, of N.S.W., lately received from England a
letter from an old lady who, having read about a
“scene” in the N.S.W. Parliament in which
W. P. C. was mixed up, concluded that he was
identical with her long-lost step-son and proceeded
to tell him of her wretched circumstances—of how
she had four shillings a week to live on, and of how
considerate her poverty-stricken landlord had
been to her. Then she went on to advise William
to shun drink as he would the Evil One, which so
tickled the gay and festive young N.S.W.
attorney (who has no stepmother and never had,
both his parents still being alive) that he sent her
a few pounds to brighten her misery.
The late Madame Blavatsky, at the age of
fifty, married a boy of sixteen (in revenge,
probably, for having, when seventeen, been
married to a man of sixty), who went stark
staring mad on the day after the wedding.
Madame was accustomed to treat this not par-
ticularly gratifying incident precisely as she
treated many other actions of hers. She never
married the boy : it was her “spook” who went
to the altar and drove the poor young husband
out of his wits ! She was a woman of great per-
sonal fascination, an undoubted mesmerist, and
exercised her power with the most absolute want
of scruple. She had her wants provided for her
by people whom she had drawn within the sphere
of her uncanny influence. Young men left their
professions, abandoned their families, threw up
their prospects in life at her bidding.
An incident of Sir George Grey’s vast
meeting at Sydney Centennial Hall, demonstrates
the profound reverence in which the great old
Radical was held by his audience of 6000. Speak-
ing of Abraham Lincoln’s early career in the
American back-blocks, Grey made an unfortunate
mistake by transposing the commencing conso-
nants of two words in the manner so much
affected by youngsters at school. Such a blunder
would have occasioned, from a large section of the
audience at all events, a tremendous burst of
laughter if made by any other public man, but on
this occasion there was not the faintest sign of
merriment, although the slip, a very awkward
one indeed, must have been noticed by everyone
within the range of the speaker’s voice. It was
an eloquent though silent tribute of respect, from
an audience consisting largely of blunt toilers, not
ordinarily very delicate in such matters.
D. 0. P. Moodie, who died on the voyage
to England from the Transvaal awhile ago, was
an old and eccentric Australian pressman. He
came to Australia fresh from hunting experiences
in South Africa, about 20 years ago, and used to
do the Adelaide block in hunting costume. He
started a paper in Adelaide called the Portonian,
but, like its owner, it was never wealthy, and died.
Moodie walked from Adelaide to Melbourne
■years ago to chastise A. T. Clark, of the Williams-
town Advertiser, who had pained Moodie’s loyal
heart by “insulting” Her Gracious. Although
eccentric, Moodie was very popular with every-
body, and his pronounced Bohemian proclivities
and devil-may-care habits made him notorious in
the sacred city. He was most generous with his
money, and would cheerfully spend his last shilling
if it returned a modicum of fun, or enabled him to
do a good turn to any hard-up man.
Of the Labour candidates so far returned
to the N.S. Wales Legislative Assembly, three,
Johnson, Scott, and M'Gowan, are boilermakers,
the latter having been discharged from the
Government workshops after his nomination ; two
are ex-seamen, Clark and Davis, the latter being
secretary to the Seamen’s Union ; one, Murphy, is
secretary marine officers; Darnley is a plasterer ;
Bavister, a bricklayer; Danahey, an engineer;
one, Hollis, a doctor; three are miners, Began,
Cook, and Cann, the latter (president of the Amal
gamated Miners’ Association) being returned un-
opposed for Sturt; one, Newman, is a mine
manager ; Clark (St. Leonards) is an auctioneer;
three are compositors, Sharp, Fitzgerald, and
Houghton, the latter being also secretary to the
Trades and Labour Council; Hindle is, or was, a
shop employe; Kelly is secretary to the Wharf
Labourers’ Union ; Cotton, an ex-shearer, runs
the Democrat newspaper, has an interest in a
Newtown spoke-factory, and may be classed, like
Black, as a journalist.

The Bulletin rises to enquire what has
become of Lord and Lady Carington of late.
Lady C., from all we hear, appears to have
dropped correspondence completely with Potts
Point, and even Lord Protector Parkes doesn’t
get his “few lines” from the Baron every mail
now as was his wont. The'Caringtons appear to
have pretty well ended their friendship with all
sorts of N.S.W. people. In view of the fact of
the reduction of passenger-rates “home ” and the
number of nonentities who make for Yurrup and
dear old Hingland by every mail-steamer, the
Caringtons have done a wise thing in their own
generation—and the next one—in giving the conge
to their Australian acquaintances. The Baron
came to N.S.W. to allow of his finances being put
on a firmer footing, and now that this has been
accomplished he can see fresh breakers ahead if he
keeps open his old grey bouse for all Australians.
The Bulletin will give a bound copy of its “Pro-
verbs ” to the first Australian who finds the Baron
at home, after this date, when he calls at Wycombe
Abbey.

“ It has been authoritatively denied that
the Prince of Wales was concerned in the election
of Mr. Arthur Wilson, one of the witnesses in the
late baccarat case, as a member of the Marl-
borough Club,” says a London cable. This, on
the face of it, is sheer nonsense, the fact being
that no one can possibly be elected to the Marl-
borough Club without the personal concurrence of
the Prince of Wales, who has a veto on all nomina-
tions just in the same way as Court etiquette
gives him a veto with respect to the list of guests
invited to meet him at any private house. To be
admitted to the Marlborough Club means that
you have been chosen as a member or “ hanger-
on ” of the Prince of Wales’ own special social
coterie, and no man has ever been admitted with-
out Tummy’s express sanction.
* # #
The Marlborough, says a London paper,
started by the Prince of Wales and certain
dissatisfied members of White’s when their com
mittee decided to prohibit smoking except in
certain rooms, is about the most exclusively Royal
club in London, so much so that a correspondent
informs the London cox-respondent of the Man-
chester Guardian he had to rise from his chair
at the luncheon-table and stand at attention no
less than five times in half-an-hour, as this or that
princeling made entrance. The election of every
member bears the Prince of Wales’ vise, and the
latest to pass the ordeal (prior to Arthur Wilson)
was Henry Irving.

The Victorian artists’ reception to Bern-
hardt, at Melbourne Athenaeum, was about as
funny as they make such things. The function
had been arranged to last from 3 to 4.30 p.m.,
but Sara conveniently misunderstood the invitation
to mean that she was expected to come in at the
death. So she arrived in a great hurry, just as
the shades of evening were beginning to fall, and
in about ten minutes it was time for her to go.
Meanwhile Sara had duly waxed ecstatic over
some samples of local art, and heard an elegant
address in French from the hon. sec. to the effect
that she was being welcomed as a painter and
sculptor, no less than as a divine artist on the
stage. Then the gifted victim smiled graciously
at a few people and rushed away. Another of the
penalties of greatness had been paid.
* * *
Sir William Clarke “ shouted ” Sara Bern-
hardt’s shooting picnic the other Sunday to Mon-
day. By the way, although the Hebrews have gi ven
fair support to the French plays, they seem afraid
to make any special demonstration in Sara’s
honour. Which perhaps is just as well, for the
difference between her and a mob of bookmakers’
wives would be very marked at any special
Jewish gathering.

“ Some artist,” says London Hawk,
“ appears to have been hoaxing the editor of
Scribner. The frontispiece to this month’s issue
shows Sir Henry Parkes, the Premier of N.S.W.,
and his wife crossing Broadway, New York,
and a realistic touch is given to the picture
by the addition of a pet pug. As it happens. Sir
Henry never set foot in New York in his life.”
The Hawk is wrong in the latter statement. But
the present Lady Parkes never set foot in N.Y.,
and we are not at all certain that the late Lady P.
ever did so. The lady who crossed Broadway may
be Stella, of whom the poet Parkes sings :
And on the Rocky Mountain’s height,
Eight thousand feet above the sea, love,
My Stella kissed me through the night,
Yes, darling, thou wert with me, love.
• * *
The same old farce of “In re agent., one,”
which has been played of late years so success-
fully in the Australias, is put on the legal boards
“at home” pretty frequently, too. A British
judge struck off four solicitors on one day recently
HER LAST WORDS.
FIRST MAN: “So your wife has left you?”
SECOND MAN: “She has.”
FIRST MAN: “What were her last words on leaving you!”
SECOND MAN: “Is my hat on straight, you brite?”
for “misappropriation of trust funds.” Out
here we do get to know the names of the em-
bezzlers; “at home” the predatory scoundrel
gets another show at swindling because his anony-
mity is preserved.
# • *
A Bulletin correspondent pertinently
enquires how it is that a clergyman who has
admittedly appropriated £GOO, the trust funds of
two children, escapes the criminal law, while a
bank-clerk, who also takes other people’s money in
the hope of replacing it after pocketing the surplus
made by it, gets years of imprisonment?
The Victorian branch of the British
Medical Association has just discussed the ques-
tion of admitting lady-doctors as members—this,
wc presume, in view of the fact seven or
eight lady-graduates of Melbourne I niversity
will next year commence practice in Victoria.
Dr. Cobb held that ladies should not bo admitted,
as either the free discussion of all classes of
medical subjects would become impossible or else
the chivalrous feelings that ought always be
entertained towards women would suffer. Lady-
doctors will, The Bulletin thinks, do excellent
business, especially in regard to the smaller
maladies of women and children, and their
services will be greatly in request by jealous hus-
bands and by old maids who don’t know what s
the matter with them. It will be a long time,
however, ere female practitioners gain the confi-
dence of their sex to the same extent as that in
which it is possessed by the male sawboneses.
Lovely woman looks to man as her natural pro-
tector, and we have yet to meet the woman who
has any confidence in the other woman. The
world may argue all round this fact as it likes,
but the fact remains all the same.
# * *
Dr. Cobb’s delicacy about arguing certain
medical subjects before woman goes in the direc-
tion of proving, if any proof were wanted, ttiat
men are really a deal more modest than women,
and that they are in the habit of over-rating the
delicacy of the fair sex under such circumstances.
A very little hospital experience will teach any-
body that.
* * *
In spite of a little delicate shriek from
one Dr. Cobb, writes a Bulletin correspondent,
the Victorian branch of the British Medical
Association has decided to admit duly qualified
ladies to membership. It is tolerably obvious
that a determination to boycott women-doctors
would have very shortly resulted in their forming
their own association, but this contingency was
not hinted at by the broken-up monopolists who
so magnanimously accepted the inevitable last
week. They used the occasion as another oppor-
tunity to trot out the old professional chestnut
that they are engaged in a holy mission, and the
meeting smiled a gentle, kerristian smile at the
speaker who said—“ When women showed an
earnest desire to contribute their share in the
alleviation of suffering humanity it was not their
(the men’s) function to discourage them.” The
time is going by when these qualified extortioners
may expect the most ignorant readers to swallow
such gammon. That women have been alleviating
suffering, ever Adam was first laid up with
indigestion and Eve made him a mustard-plaster,
is as certain as the fact that the average
doctor works to alleviate his qwn wants, and
is no more of a philanthropist than his twin
brother, the lawyer. The one great aim of the
average doctor is to be able to charge fees so high
that the bulk of suffering humanity (which is
extremely hard-up) must die rather than call him
in, and when he is called in to see a squatter who
has nothing the matter with him, he gets hold of
the first woman he sees and recommends “ careful
nursing.” Thirty guineas. The doctors’ gratuitous
work in the hospital is absolutely necessary to
their business. In the first instance they must
learn how to make a decent pretence of knowing
something, and when their private practice is
established they actually fight for a position as
visiting slaughterers because the advt. is mighty
cheap at the price. Yet they would have us
believe that they labour for pure love of God’s
creature, in a city of high fees and horseracing,
where the death-rate always rises on Cup Day
because every owner of a large brass-plate is punt-
ing down at Elemington. How many doctors are
there who will leave a critical case and rush off to
the races, quite indifferent to the probability of
the patient suffering a relapse during the after-
noon ? They all do it in this country. Not that
they are colder-blooded than others of their kind
in other countries. The real trouble is that they
make too much money, the result of that lack of
wholesome competition which women are prepar-
ing to supply. And the excuse for their apparent
callousness is the knowledge that a male M.D.
jerking out his commonplaces at a shilling a word
is often not of the slightest practical use in a sick
room after his first visit. The responsibility rests
with the women watchers, who send rouml again
and again for the doctor only to hear him say
that they are doing everything possible, and it all
depends on the nursing.

From an English paper, of May Bbh :
“Some who pretend to be knowing in such
matters say that the visit to England of the late
popular Mayor of Sydney will be followed by an
announcement in the Birthday Gazette (a paper
which certainly fills a few long-felt wants —Ep. B.)
of great interest to that gentleman and his amiable
wife. His friend, Lord Carington, will take Mr.
Burdekin in hand, of course, between this and 24tti
May, and all that may be said at present is that
if the ex-Mayor of the ‘ ancient capital ’of Aus-
tralia does become Sir Sydney Burdekin, there will
he general rejoicings in New South Wales.’ Re-
joicings is not the word. The “ parent ’’ portion
of the Commonwealth would burst its boiler. —
During the visit of a certain distinguished
gentleman at Government House, Sydney, under
the Caringtonian regime, ho (the guest) turned in
to a leading drapery and hosiery establishment
and ordered a goodly assortment of the choicest
ready-mades any man need wear at one time. He
was not much to look at, and a council of war, as
to giving him credit, was held amongst the soft-
goodsmen. The telephone offered a speedy
solution of the case, and the managing director
rang up “ Government House.” “ Hallo ! -
“Hallo!” “Please say if there is a Mr.
visiting Lord Carington?” “Yes.” “Is he all
right?” “Think so, was so at breakfast time,”
“Con he be trusted with goods?” “Daresay;
don’t think he’ll drop them?” “You don’t
appear to understand me.” “D n you, you
don’t seem to understand yourself.” “ Hallo.”
“Hallo.” “Who is there?” “Rupert Caring-
ton ! ”

MORE GAIETY.
Back again are the Gaiety Girls,
With scarlet lips and teeth like pearls,
And many a smart new cockney wile,
And costumes built in an airy style—
Embodiments bright of arts that please
In a different line to Sara B.’s ;
The wheel of Time, with its constant whirls,
Has brought us back the Gaiety Girls.
But the Gaiety “boys”—O, where are they?
Faded and gone, they’ve had their day.
Where are the smart young tailors’ blocks
Who swelled, of yore, in a private box ?
Where are the gorgeous “ Silver Kings ”
Who gave the bouquets and diamond rings,
And suppers—for smiles and such like things'
Ask of the winds that cool their brows,
As they shear the sheep or milk the cows ;
Ask of the friends who lent them cash
In those land-boom times when friends were rash ;
“ Ask a policeman ” —he might know
The mashers of three short years ago.
The Gaiety Girls wear gems that gleam,
And life for them is a lively dream,
And whether their names be old or new
They look the same at a passing view.
There’s a Gaiety dash in their dance and walk,
And a Gaiety turn in their mode of talk,
A recognised style of form and face—
But the Gaiety “ boys,” they change apace.
Sweet is the sound of the syrens’ song
To the boys of to-day, who will soon go wrong,
Though sad is the sound of the song when sung
To the stone-broke ghosts of the boys gone bung.
BALLAD OF A BEARD.
Once there was an Karl,
Small and pale and weird,
Whose supremest wish
Was to grow a beard;
But his Countess, she
Would not hear of this—
Horrid hair she could
Ne’er abide to kiss.
Then she journeyed “ home"
And he cried with glee—
“ Folks will pretty soon
See what they shall see."
So, forsev’ral weeks.
He remained perdu,
Then, one gorgeous day,
Blossomed into view,
And the people saw,
With emotion strong,
He had grown a beard
Quite three inches long I
She returned, and he,
Sorry for his rash
Act, cut off his heard,
Leaving his moustache ;
But the Countess, she,
With a haughty scoff
Pointing to h's mo.,
Muttered •* Shave it off 1”

“Splendid joke! Ha! ha!"

IF BURDEKIN WERE KNIGHTED.
What words could mortal pen employ,
in prose or flowing measure,
To tell our transcendental joy,
Our gratitude and pleasure —
What adjectives could writers find,
What metaphors excited,
To represent our state of. mind
if Burdekin were knighted ?
Ye gods ! imagine, if ye can
(Although the job’s not easy),
Our pride in that majestic man,
So affable and greasy ;
We worship him as “ Mister” plain—
We’d be so dashed delighted
Our minds would hardly bear the strain,
If Burdekin were knighted.
The dogs of sunny New South Wales
Would bark their exultation,
The midnight cats with stand-up tails
Would typify the nation;
On each high hill throughout the land
A beacon would be lighted
To let the heavens understand
That Burdekin was knighted.
Nor east nor west no Mayor deserves
His Sovereign’s reward more ;
From grovel’s paths he never swerves,
He couldn't love the Lord more.
Her royal trumpet he has blown,
I ler noble deeds recited :
V. R. would need a bigger throne

Government, the Acting-Chief Justice and
Governor Kintore about the appointment of a
Queen’s Counsel. The Governor, on the recom-

H. E. Downer, M.P., but the Government won’t
listen to any but the claims of E. P. Nesbit, a
clever young counsel, for the position. None of
the parties will give way, and there the matter
will remain until Chief Justice Way returns.

The Australian Mutual Provident Society
last week got leave from N.S.W. Supreme Court
to refrain from paying up the £lOOO life-policy of
Mr. J. O. S. Evans, deceased (it denied that he
had ever completed his policy), who had, after
being treated for dropsy following on kidney-
disease, declared to the society that he had only
consulted a doctor for rheumatism •within the pre-
vious five years. Now the A.M.P. is generally
most careful in its medical examinations. How
on earth could any A.M.P. doctor ever have
passed a man in such a condition? The Bulle-
tin’s idea about life-assurance is that policies
should be absolutely indefeasible-that the com-
panies should allow in their rates for all risks from
fraud or misrepresentation of any kind, holding
their medical officers, and not the relatives of the
deceased, responsible when such a case as that of
Mvans crops up. We do not deny that under
existing conddions, the A.M.P. was quite justified
in disputing the Evans claim.

Sydney Evening News lately complained

Why are Australian solicitors, who stick

We pause for a reply, and will feel very tired

The odium theologicum, it would seem, is not
dead, but only in quarantine. A North Sydney
Presbyterian parson of the old school was “ verra

nominating a Parliamentary candidate of another
faith, and reasoned with him. The reply
was forcible and unanswerable : “ My dear sir, I
thought I couldn’t go far wrong in nominating for
Parliament a man whom you chose to open your
last church bazaar.”

Tincture of ginger is the latest fashionable
liquor in high-toned British society. It is used
chiefly by ladies, the female sex having grown
tired of that dreary muddlement which is pro-
duced by sal-volatile and eau-de-cologne. The
peculiarity of tincture of ginger is that it con-
tains 95 per cent, of alcohol, and is calcu-
lated to eat holes in a rhinoceros. This
sort of thing makes the teetotal movement look
unpromising. Teetotalism has been toiling at the
pump for about a century without abolishing one
single liquor among all the innumerable drinks
that are raging throughout the globe ; and mean-
while the number of new varieties of grog are
past counting.

Bismuth looks all very well under gas, but when

powdered glass, or like the glitter of a mundic
reef in a strong light, or like the outside of a

There is one thing about the Wales-
Gordon-Cumming business which hasn’t yet been
explained. When Camming virtually acknow-
ledged his guilt by agreeing to swear off cards for
the rest of his existence, did he hand back the
money to the cleaned-out heir-apparent, or did he
stick to it? Also did Wales ask him to return
the loot, and if so did he say that he would see
Wales blowed first ?

Queensland history sometimes repeats it-
self elsewhere: —“Therehasbeen alittle Bar quarrel
in Wales. A father and his son were members of a
Welsh circuit. The father was made judge, and
the son secured a large and lucrative practice in
his father's Court. The Bar grumbled, and did
nothing; but when the second son was in due
time called to the Bar and proposed to join the
circuit, the Bar mess refused to elect him. The
judge and the eldest son thereupon removed their
names from the circuit list.”

An exchange : —“ The painful fact is made
public that the poet Tennyson has always em-
ployed a rhyming dictionary to aid him in fram-
ing his beautiful poems.” We can see nothing
painful in this : we occasionally make use of a
rhyming dictionary ourselves. At the same time
we must acknowledge that we have alway s
wondered why the fellows who compile thes e
dictionaries don’t also write the poems. Probably
the dictionary-making pays better.
Mr. Berry Cass, writing to a Kyneton
(Vic.) paper, says “May I respectfully request
the favour of a few lines in reply to your extra-
ordinary report of my last night’s lecture. I am
perfectly astonished that you should have been
supplied with such a tissue of falsehoods. . . .
Instead of my having taken a negative view of
hell, I enforced, in the most positive terms, the
belief in a literal hell of fire and brimstone.” How
anxious this gentle Christian is to demonstrate
that he is not one of those soft-hearted persons
who credit their Maker with the possession of at
least as much mercy as themselves. A few lines
to Mr. Cass
A Port Darwin man stated in his census

The Australasian states that “a golden
thread has been drawn across the map of Austra-
lia by the Earl of Kintore,” and this simple but
first-class observatipn has gone down favourably
™ the nobility and aristocracy of the country.
And yet, when you come to think of it, it would
haveTioen a lot more to the point if it had stated
briefly that the Governor had dragged a red hair
across the continent. Kintore isn’t a spider who
leaves thread behind him in all his travels; and,
anyhow, he wasn’t walking on the map, so if he
had been a spider the thread wouldn’t have been
there. Moreover, he did nearly half the trip by
train, and for that part of the performance the
engine-driver had more to do with the thread
than he had. And, in any case, who in thunder
wants thread on a map? The thing is as much
out of place as wool on a lithograph orfluff on cold
meat. The statement isn’t fact, and it is inferior
metaphor, and dashed bad poetry. If the Aus-
tralasian had adhered strictly to the truth it
would have mentioned that footmarks, old boots,
meat-tins, and empty bottles had been deposited
in various parts of Australia by the red-haired
Ear] of Kin tore ye ken, together with his worn-
out hat and sundry disused shirts and socks ; and
the accuracy of the statement would have made up
for its want of halo and radiance. But the poor
old paper is always struggling to cast a glamour
round the clothes and victuals of the peerage, and
three times out of four it makes a dead failure
of it.

Mr. Berry Cass,
Do you think it well
Thus to keep, alas,
Harping upon Hell?
Don’t you know it is—
If you don’t enquire—
Very stupid biz.
Thus to fool with fire?
What if it befell
That the Lord should make
A small private hell
For your special sake :
In which you should stew
While the ages pass—
Would that suit your view,
Mr. Berry Cass ?
Prithee be resigned,
Drop this subject drear !
Most of us can find
Hell enough up here.

materials, mantles, millinery, &c., are marked at

Mr. R. T. Vale in Reply.
Editor Bulletin.— Sir,— l have read your paper for many
years past, often with pleasure and profit, and I would
ask you for the favour of the insertion of a few lines in
reply to the article, “ Orange Pot v. Roman Kettle ”
You, as an old pressman, know how often newspapers
do not convey the language used, or fully express the
ideas expressed by a speaker. I must in this instance
refuse to accept the report you copy ; but I have no
desire to shirk the responsibility of any statements I make
on the public platform. I stated that the abbeys, mona-
steries and other ecclesiastical buildings in England were
destroyed by men who were born and brought up as
Roman Catholics; that in Catholic countries, such as
France, Italy and Spain, similar institutions were closed,
and the buildings destroyed or devoted to other purposes.
The statement as to the Cromwellian conflict is no
reply, for that was a fight on the one side by those who
upheld the divine right of kings, on the other by those
who thought the people had some rights. The reference
to prosecution of recusants in the time of Elizabeth simply
bears out my statement—they were carried out by those
who were born in the Catholic Church. The provocation
was that the recusants would not give their allegiance to
the State, but preferred to obey the Church, as in these
days. The aspect of the case that sent me into the
Orange Institution was the Dogma of Morals under which
the Catholic Church claims the right to decide for its
members how they should act and vote in all matters
they—the Church"—think fit. As one who has taken part
in the political life of Victoria for over 30 years, on what
I believe to be the Liberal side, I know that the Church
has exercised that power and its orders have beenobeyed.
I therefore learnt the bitter lesson that it was impossible
to work with men who were compelled to obey instruc-
tions given irrespective of the morals of the question at
issue.
In your reference to the wealth of the Church of Eng-
land, you omit to state that it is but a small remnant of
what was acquired by the Church of Rome at the expense
of the rest of the community. As to the other actions of
the Church of England, they claim no right to control the
action of its members in matters political.
I might go on further, but I have more regard for your
valuable space.
Yours, &a.

All the first batch of N.S.W. parliamen-
tary candidates are hoarse de combat.
Wales is reported by an English paper to
have told his expostulating Ma that he gambled
because he wanted money. That is also the
reason, presumably, that he doesn’t pay when he
loses.
The Bulletin is amused to see that “ at a
dinner of the Victorian Employers’ Union on
Wednesday last week telegrams were read out
amid loud cheers announcing the victories of the
N.S.W, Government at the polls.” Moral, the
old one —“Never holler,” etc.

AYER’S HAIR VIGOR is unrivaled for
the restoration of faded and gray hair to its
original color and freshness, and for keeping
the scalp clean and healthy. The most popular
and elegant toilet preparation in the world, all
who use It, pronounce it, also, the best hair-
growor. When the capillary glands become en-
feebled by disease, age, or neglect, this dressing
imparts renewed life to the scalp, so that the
hair again assumes its original
Fullness and Beauty.
Ladies find that this preparation imparts to the
hair a silken pliancy and a delicate and lasting
fragrance. Gentlemen use it to prevent bald-
ness, to restore faded and gray hair to its former
color and abundance, and to relieve the scalp of
troublesome humors and dandruff. A proof of
the superiority of this preparation over all
others of the kind is the constantly-increasing
demand for it in all civilized countries.

of 145 Oollins-street, Melbourne, a copy of his
pamphlet on “Deafness cured by Electro-Medica-
tion. He treats his patients solely by electricity,
and his testimonials give evidence of substantial
success. Deafness, caused by paralysis of the
muscles of the Middle Ear, closure of the Eusta-
chian tubes, chill, and other causes, he treats by
an Electric Head Battery, which is simple in con-
struction, easily worn, and painless in action.
Among the printed testimonials wo notice the
names of gentlemen well known in the Wesleyan
and other Churches— such as Mr. Thomas Stran-
ger, of Brunswick; Mrs. Dusting, of Port Mel-
bourne ; Mr. Henry Hutchison, of Hawthorn;
and many others.

Sir, —Will you, through your widely-circulated
paper, inform me and the general public if it is a
fact that “ Tattersall George Adams ” has disposed
of the whole or part of his interest in the well,
known Tattersall’s sweep, and that it is now
carried on by a syndicate of Sydney people ? If a
syndicate have it in hand will it be conducted in
the fair and square manner that it was supposed
to be when George Adams had it himself. —Yours,

In answer to “A Subscriber,” whose letter we

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
PREFACE.
“ Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples,
for lam sick of love.” Solomon, old man, you
had enough of it, if reports be true. Even I am
at present a little full-up of love, and have been
staying myself with flagons. Therefore, instead
of love, this time I choose Luck, Chance, Sors,
Fortuna, Kismet, or, in one word, “Life,” as my
theme. Lately, persons possessed of a white
swelling in the stom— — I mean waistcoat, and a
safe balance or credit in the banks, have been
trying to persuade us, the common people, that
“Industry leads to riches.” Now, where is the
Industry in holding a non-paying allotment where
gold is discovered ; or, of having a father who was
a thief ; or, of being descended from a who'esale
rum-seller; or, of marrying a hag with half-a-
milhon ; or, in fact, of being lucky? I am, there-
fore, about to tell you the story of a mate of mine
who goes by the name of Here’s Luck, and of my
mate’s mate who answers to Luck, and of the bad
luck that brought him (my mate), Luck, the good
luck. But first “ Stay mo with a flagon ! Here’s
Luck ! ”
Chapter I. — Luck.
Not many years ago a woman came, no one
knows how, on to a certain gold-field. She had a
bundle of clean, decent clothes, a clean, healthy
face, and a five-pound note. For the first night
she sought a bed at the Miners’ Home Hotel. For
the second and many more she stayed as cook and
laundress to the Warden’s wife —a lady who took
her without reference and allowed her pretty much
her own way. This washerwoman was reticent
bit civil, cheery but far from boisterous. I fancy
she is a Christian. (N.B.—Solomon was not.)
Ciiristian or heathen, however, she did a lot of
good. She washed the diggers’ moleskins at a
slulling a pair and often lent them the shilling
and gave them a cup of tea. Madame Warden
allowed her to do extra work, and liked to see the
diggers clean. There was, there is, one word that
this woman used in so many inflections that she
could express joy, sorrow, dislike, surprise, or
acquiescence with this monosyllable—Luck. And
at length she was called Luck, or Mrs. Luck. She
never said that that was not her name. Now,
there was a boozer who (let me use that splendid
Anglo-Saxon expression again) stayed himself
with flagons, until he could not swig his tea or
coffee, or a pint of water, without saying
Chapter ll.— Here’s Luck.
Thus, on these unnamed diggings there was
Luck and Here’s Luck. Jim (the latter’s name)
was dead-broke and owed four-and-six to Mrs.
Luck for washing, but he possessed a ticket in the
Dumbledee Freehold Art Union. With that he
paid his score, collared his rags and departed for
other diggings. Certainly he was advertised for
by Luck when she drew a £lOOO prize, but for
some years never a word did she hear of Jim,
The woman was no fool. With part of the thou-
sand she purchased a paying public-house and
dairy in, say, Manaro : and waited for Jim to put
in his claim for fifteen-and-six in the pound.
Again I ask, was it industry that made that pub.
and farm? Was it want of industry that caused
Jim to wander about among gullies and ridges,
when there was a woman ready to ante-up £775 to
him? Here’s Apropos to nothing. I’ll chip in
with a story of myself.
Chapter ITT.— Bad Luck,
I was draftsman to a tramway-company and
had a holiday because it was New Year’s Day, a
day sacred to the god Here’s!ye in Scotland. My
chum, Willie Murray, sharer of our common
sitting-room, asked me to give him help in finish-
ing some tracings that were badly wanted on the
next day, January the 2nd. Luckily he asked
me at breakfast, and his office was near at hand.
The last words I printed were Bald and Wild ,
Accountants, Agents —right in the corner. Now,
Air. Bald was my agent, and had a few pounds of
mine in his hand. Therefore I took the trouble to
look over the original of the tracing. It was a
new opening of an old mine in Spain—call it the
Tradio Copper-mining Company, Limited. Take
notice that Bald and Wild are the smartest
chartered accountants in Glasgow, and there-
fore in the world. Next morning I
nobbled Mr. Bald on the stair and in-
sisted on his investing all the cash he held of mine
in deposit money at 10 per cent, in Tarpios.
“ Whab the deil do ye ken aboot Tarpio ? ”
That’s what he said. But I let him know that it
had come to my understanding how he was float-
ing a big company and that I must have 40 or 50
f reference shares. “ All taken up, Air. Wrinkler.”
then suggested that no elders of the Free Church
dare do that before the lists were opened on the
Exohange. “All right, my boy: in memory of
the respect in which I held your deceased grand-
mother, I’ll see you get them.” And I did.
Now, white paunches, was it want of industry
that lost all of us a chance, just because Spain
indulged in one of its periodical revolutions ? It
was Luck, Bad Luck, Dombad Luck, In this
way, instead of driving chariots in Park Terrace,
Glasgow, I came to Manaro Diggings and at Mrs.
Luck’s sign of the Golden Hall, I was—same
again, when in walked a very muddy man, not in
the best of tempers, either. But the landlady
said, “ Luck ! Here’s Luck.”
Chapter IV.— Mixed Luck.
I must go back a month with Jim. He had
tried every gully for alluvial and every spur for a
reef, and was very stiff. A publican asked him
t® raise a few tons of stone from a trial shaft,
promising £6 for the job. Then he came out to
him and offered a cheque. Perhaps the bit of
paper was right enough, but Jim wanted cash,
and went to the publican next day and received
six notes. One, “Old Bob,” a shepherd, was
there suffering a recovery, and offered to show a
reef for two drinks. He got the drinks and was
told by Jim that he had been had too often, and
did not want to be laid on. Then Jim said,
“ Here’s Luck ” until he had no more coin, and
went away sorrowful unto his camp.
On his way home he came across a man, patch-
ing his only trousers, and therefore bare-legged.
This poor fellow had been backed up by his
brother for more than a year, looking
for gold, but had not seen a speck.
Then the assistance was stopped, and he
was just mending his pants for his home-
ward journey. Close to the start he met “Old
Bob,” and for two drinks was shown the reef,
which Jim refused, and on which he and the
publican were glad to peg off No. 1 North, This
reef, the General Jackson (prospector was a
Yankee from Yackandandah), paid £5OOO in divi-
dends for the prospectors and not a speck in No. 1
North ! Where does the industry come in here ?
In the mistrust of the cheque, in the flagons, in
the two drinks, or in the patching of the bare-
legged Yankee’s pants ?
Chapter V. and Last.—Good Luck.
Jim was offered his divvy and refused it because
he had reckoned on giving away the whole lottery-
chance for four-and-six. Then Jim offered him-
self and as Luck could see no other way of pay-
ment the firm is now Luck and Here’s Luck or
Mr. and Mrs. Jim, and the sign is the “ Lucky
Digger.”
SCOTTY THE WEINKLER.
A WONDERFUL DANE.
Herr Rassmussen, the celebrated Danish Her-
balist and proprietor of the famous Denmark
pills, has only just completed his 30th year of
age, and although he is one of the most successful
of Australian medical men, he is one of the most
modest and unselfish sort of beings we have ever
come across. His patent medicines have become
famous and are used almost all through the world
and bid fair to become the most popular of all
known remedies. Herr Rassmussen holds over 50
patents and registrations for his remedies, and
although he is in possession of a Registration
diploma from the Government of N.S. Wales,
as well as from Queensland, entitling him to call
his remedies “Dr. Rassmussen’s remedies,” he
nevertheless calls them plain “Herr Rass-
mussen’s,” which designation he thinks is quite
sufficient to guarantee their virtues and command
the confidence of the public, as he sells more pills
in Australia than any other medicine-man. He
claims that his remedies have cured over 50,000
sufferers, and his numerous testimonials go far to
prove it. He was also presented with a magnifi-
cent gold medal by several of his cured patients a
short time ago, and he is a credit to his profession.
He has written several good medical works, the
principal one of which is “ The Natural Doctor,”
a valuable addition to the medical literature of
this colony.*
".The recent Anglo-Manipuri “fight” is
described as a “ heavy combat.” Now the British
who atacked the enemy’s trenches had but twelve
(chiefly niggers) wounded and two (niggers) killed,
while the Manipuris left behind them 128 actually
slain besides many slaughtered by the pursuing
cavalry. Battue, not battle, is the word.
When Premier Munro was in Scotland,
more than a year ago, he addressed a temperance-
meeting, which he favoured with a little historical
account of Australia. Of old-time bushrangers,
he remarked that some were shot and others
hanged. Of publicans, he told how Sunday-
trad ers were fined £5, £lO and £l5 respectively for
first, second and third offences. The Scotch
reporter who was present got his temperance
“ notes ” mixed, and the local press came out
with a report which made Munro assert that
second-offence publicans were “shot or hanged,
according to the degree of their crimes.” Soon
afterwards Munro received a letter from a Scottish
Women’s Temperance Union, asking for fuller
particulars respecting Australian licensing laws
and their penalties. When the S.W.T.XJ.
learned the true and tame condition of things, it
sent Munro a formal acknowledgment, thanking
him for his courtesy, but regretting that the
published report which had misled them teas nut
trm
WHAT EXPERIENCE TEACHES
IS BEST.
There is something to consider in the daily ex-
penses for the household necessities, which in the
aggregate of the year amount to a great deal.
The ethics of buying and selling appear to be for
the vendor to get all he can, and for the purchaser
to see that he don’t get too .much. But what is
too much ? It is almost a profound question, and
presents the strange paradox that the dearest in
many ways is often the cheapest. Certainly thi s
is so in food, when health is and in
remedies which restore health after it has been
impaired. It is certainly so in clothing, for a
cheap suit that will hardly last one season is
dearer than the one that will last two seasons, the
difference in price being reasonable. So in shoes
and the like. Recurring to the items of food and
health, undoubtedly the most important, it is
found that villainous adulteration is what renders
it cheaper in much that is sold, and men are
known who have spent thousands to be cured of
disease, have' suffered years of agony, and have
trifled away their substance on worthless remedies.
That which is testified to by thousands as being
an absolute cure, and permanently efficacious, is
cheap at any price in comparison with such as
have no virtue, and which prolong suffering. A
case in point is the following: “New Bloom-
field, Pa., April 26, 1886. The Charles A.
Vogeler Co., Baltimore, Md. Gentlemen. —For
more than 30 years I had been afflicted with rheu-
matism so severe that I had to use morphine to
secure rest at night. Spent hundreds of dollars
with physicians and for remedies without benefit.
Five years ago I tried St. Jacobs oil, and it
effected an entire and permanent cure. Cold or
damp weather does not affect me at all. I desire
to give my unqualified endorsement. —J. E. Bon-
sall, clerk of the several Courts of Perry County
Pa.” The point here is not so much what Mr.
Bonsall paid for the great remedy for pain, for
the price is a mere bagatelle, but that he was per-
manently cured after 30 years’ suffering. Of
course the poor must count the cost in everything;
but they should reckon on the sound basis that
that which is bad is worthless, and that which is
the best and will cure, and stay cured, is cheap at
any price.
THE LADIES’ WATERBURY WATCH.
Is a plain nickel-plated time-keeper, which per-
forms its functions as well in water as it does in
the owner’s pocket, and is sold for 22s Cd by all
store-keepers and dealers throughout the colonies.
Persons afflicted with doubt as to the advertised
merits of the wonderful Waterbury Watches can
inspect the originals of all published testimonials
on application at the company’s head Austral-
asian offices in Sydney, or they can buy a Water-
bury, and test it in competition with one of the
“cheap English levers” constructed for the
benefit of the credulous, composed of nine-tenths of
case, and the remainder stamped rubbishy Swiss
mechanism; which accounts for all the milk there
is in that particular cocoanut. The Ladies’
Waterbury (Series “ L ”), like the other products
of this world-famed factory, is only just what is
claimed for it—a perfectly reliable timekeeper,
equally adapted to the necessities of a live duchess
or a washerwoman, and sold at a price that places
it within the reach of all classes. The watch
itself has since its introduction given universal
satisfaction. It is not only an accurate, but also
a neat and elegant little time-keeper, similar in
construction to the new short-winding gentlemen’s
Waterbury (Series “J”), but smaller, and with-
out seconds-hand. Mr. Chas. J. Horstey, J.P.,
O.P.S , Mudgee, N.S.W., who is the happy pos-
sessor of one of these watches, writes : “ I have
much pleasure in stating that my Waterbury
Watch (a Series “ L ”) is without exception one of
the best watches I ever owned, although I have
had many more expensive. It is a reliable and
excellent time-keeper.” To be obtained from any
respectable store keeper or dealer ; price, 22s 6d.

After Dinner.
Framed in our old verandah-chair
(The sea-side air and sunset braving),
She seems a picture, still and fair,
Her fan of feathers scarcely waving:
Dressed all in crimson, from the slip
Of airy gauze that crowns her tresses,
To satin shoe’s embroidered tip ;
(Her stockings always match her dresses).
So sweet she looks, one halt believes
She must be some Venetian lady
Come back to life (with hanging sleeves)
From marble palace, grim and shady :
Some people think she is a dunce,
And some find fault with her complexion j
You do not see these faults at once,
But only after long reflection.
And near her bends the man of Law-
Heavy his brow with mystic learning—
His fingers trifle with a straw ;
His eyes are dark, and sad, and burning ;
Perhaps he speaks a tender word
Or fragment of some old love-ballad,
But this is all 1 overheard—
“ The proper way to make a salad .”

Family Financing.
‘‘ They tell me you work for four shillings a clay ;
How is it you clothe your six boys on such pay ?”
“ I know you will think me conceited and queer,
But I do it because I’m a good financier.
“ There’s Pete, John, Jim, Joe, William and Ned,
A half-dozen boys to be clothed up and fed ;
“ And I buy for them all good, plain victuals to eat;
But clothing—l only buy clothing for Pete.
“ When Pete’s clothes are too small for him to get on
My wife makes ’em over and gives ’em to John.
“ When for John, who is ten, they have grown out of
date,
She just makes ’em over to Jim, who is eight.
“ When for Jim they’ve become too ragged to fix,
She just makes ’em over for Joe, who is six.
“ And when little Joseph can wear ’em no more,
She just makes ’em over for Bill, who is four.
“ And when for young Bill they no longer will do,
She just makes ’em over for Ned, who is two.
“ So you see, if I get enough clothing for Pete,
The family is furnished with clothing complete.”
“ But when Ned has got through with the clothing, and
when
He has thrown it aside—what do you with it then ?”
“ Why, once more we go round the circle complete,
And begin to use it as patches for Pete.”
“The Pivot.”
Within that dark and silent town,
No living being stirred ;
In vain I wandered up and down
No sound of life I heard.
The gloomy silence of the scene
Weighed on my soul like lead ;
So strangely still, it might have been
A city of the dead.
I called on Heav’n—nor called in vain,
A vision blest my sight;
For, gleaming through a window-pane,
I saw a candle-light.
I reached the door—my eager knocks
Called forth an ancient dame ;
With wrinkled skin and scanty locks,
And age down-bedoubled frame.
“ What town is this? lone dame,” I said,
“ Of light and life bereft—
Its people all, I see, are dead,
And you alone are left.”
“ Young man, you’re altogether wrong,”
My aged informant said—
“ This noble city is Geelong;
It’s people are in bed !”
Australia; A Patriotic Poem.
Fair land, replete in all good things,
Great men, and hardwood logs,
Materials for Irish stew,
And lots of blushing poets, too,
And aldermen, and hogs.
Fair mistress of the Southern seas,
Land of the fiercely fizzing flood
Of beer and tea; oh, land of rocks,
(All taken up as mining-blocks),
Of dust, likewise of mud.
Oh, land of mountains—and of flats ;
Whose stalwart sons can hold their own ;
Oh, land of love, tight boots and bunions,
Bright eyes, red lips, and steak-and-onions ;
Oh, land that well can go a loan.
Oh, land (we do, each acre’s mortgaged)
No blood pollutes thy wide Domain,
Except blue-blooded earls and dukes
Who camp within its sheltered nooks
And sigh for “ home ” in vain.
Oh, land (past rhymers have subsisted
On that one phrase, so now I’ll kill it),
Oh, land where every citizen
Before he’s reached the age of ten
Expects a Guv’ment billet.
Oh, land, whose eggshell cradle floats
In latitudes elysian—
But why should I sing higher than
That heavenly inspired man—
The average politician.

The latest thing in cosmetics is a kind of
scarlet grease, which is sold in a pot and used to
paint the gums. It is nasty to taste, and the
grease “ runs,” so that the beauteous female who
uses it feels as if she had an old candle-end in her
mouth, and it isn’t over-nice for the outside party
who kisses her, for he finds little bits of the sub-
stance on her lips ; but then it lends a new dazzle
to her smile, and when she opens her mouth it
makes her teeth look like a row of snowballs in a
butcher’s shop. Still it looks to' the unbiased
critic as if this paint business was getting to be a
trifle overdone. There is very little about a really
high-toned female except her feet and her wind-
pipe that isn’t painted nowadays.
We would call readers’ attention to the ad-
vertisement appearing on page 21 of this issue.
We can recommend it as a genuine thing. The
author, Dr. Hall, Ph. D., L.L.D., F.S.Sc., is a
man of strong and vigorous thought, well-known
for his scientific work, the “Problem of Human
Life,” and others. He has demonstrated and
proved his method by over 40 years persona!
treatment before submitting it to the public.
The testimonials prove it to be of the widest and
far-reaching effect. It is based upon physiologi-
cal laws that are unquestioned, and it is not
saying too much to claim that every thorough user
must receive benefit. It requires no extra expense
of any kind for either rich or poor, and is
applicable either in the bush or the city residence.*

An Auckland (N.Z.) citizen still possesses
—or is said to possess—the old imperial crown of
King Cakobau of Fiji. Cakobau struggled through
most of his reign without a crown, but, becoming
civilised, he called for tenders in his old age for
the manufacture of that emblem of sovereignty.
The successful tenderer—a local blacksmith —
undertook to do the whole business, labour and
material included, for ten shillings; and he fixed
up a really good crown out of a sawed-off meat-tin
covered with velvet. But Cakobau, in true
monarchical style, refused to pay, and when he
was out in regal state, with the meat-tin tiara on
his head, and looking every inch a king, the black-
smith used to run behind him howling for his
half-sovereign, and so he ran and howled till the
last day of Cakohau’s reign. He is still unpaid,
and his descendants continue to vociferate in vain
for the money just as the heirs of Wales’ tailor
will vociferate in the middle of next century and
got nothing for their pains.
Melbourne Post-office clock was persis-
tently and discordantly “loyal” on Queen’s
Birthday. It chimed “God Save,” &c., and
“ Rule Britannia,” one down, t’other come up, for
about sixteen hours, more or less, and the imme-
diate neighbourhood had become a hot-bed of Re-
publicanism long before midnight. These
mechanical contrivances for strengthening the
Throne are always apt to work in a wrong direc-
tion. The Muse will explain :
BROWN'S COVERSION.
Old Brown he was a Jingo true,
With appetite voracious
For all the yarns relating to
The goodness of Her Gracious;
He praised the Queen with heart and voice,
Until it used to bore us
To hear the worthy snob rejoice
That Y. was reigning o’er us.
Of all the folks in Melbourne town
Whose forms are fat and heavy,
Not one could beat Elijah Brown
At rushing to a levee.
He sang, in no uncertain tone,
The Anthem—nay, he bawled it;
That England gave him birth ’twas known —
His “mother-land ” he called it.
For thirty years this person stout
Loved institutions regal;
The Bulletin he’d simply scout
As something most illegal;
In politics our hero ranged
Up close to Mrs. Grundy,
But all his “ views ” and notions changed
At once, the other Monday.
Old Brown was blowing round the “Block”
(A ramble to his liking),
He heard the new Post-otficc clock
Its loyal ditties striking :
Whilst others covered up their ears
And thought the racket frightful,
He said, twixt apoplectic cheers,
“ Now isn’t that delightful! ”
But when again, and yet again
The clock had chimed “ God Save ” her,
The joy of Brown began to wane,
The tune had lost its savour;
He felt his ardour slowly cool,
His brain begin to soften—
He wished Britannia wouldn’t rule
The Waves so doosid often.
“ It must be so,” he murmured low,
t “The truth there’s no gainsaying—
This awful clock was made to show
The game that Vve been playing ;
I, too, have been a mere machine
(Until I’ve nearly busted)
For striking up ‘God Save the Queen,*
With which I’m now disgusted.”
Brown crushed his hat upon his head,
And left off looking pompous ;
Without another word he fled
From that infernal rumpus.
A boy was shouting “ Argus ! ” and
More journals of that kidney ;
But Brown, with sixpence in his hand,
Said “ Bulletin—the Sydney.”
Health is impossible when the blood is impure*

846 Maequarie-street North, Sydney, June 24,1891,
Mr Dear Moorabinua,—
Popular as the Jerseys already are, there are a lot of
people who view their gyrations with the fishy eye of dis-
affection, and those are the people who during the
Caringtonian era used to invite themselves to the vice-
regal marble halls, but who now never get any further
than the sentry-box. Lady Jersey objects, it would
appear, to make herself the target for people who are far
from the Pure Merino social fold, or to admit into her
drawing-room drapery-delegates sent by their firms for
fashion-tips. In the sacred vice-regal precincts one no
longer shoulders barmaids, housemaids and cooks (at
least not in an active sense), because Lady Jersey invites
her persecutors. Nevertheless the vice-regal invitations
are strewn tolerably broadcast, and the clique that so
successfully “ran” little Lady C. has been broken up
and scattered to the four winds of Heaven. And thus it
is that there are people who chafe at the Jersey idea of
no public receptions and who mourn for the free-and-
easy Caringtons in whom, so far as the manner of their
official receptions was concerned, democracy was in-
carnate.
The second Jersey June “ at home” happened on 16th
inst., when the familiar elements of girls, men, flowers,
waxy floor and good music, mixed together, resulted, as
usual, in a happy little dance. Everybody arrived shortly
before and after 9, and when, at a quarter past. Lord and
Lady Jersey entered the drawing-room, the guest-list was
almost complete. Then the first square struck up and
women began to wonder what their neighbours had got on*
Lady Jersey, whom everybody gushes over as a hostess >
wore pale-blue brocade and diamonds; her daughters, in
cream striped silk, finished off with a little lace ; a some-
what Bernhardtish garment worn by a belle just back
from Hingland, and who talks like it, was in tiger-yellow
silk, draped in some strange way, and relieved by a big
loose bunch of violets ; a titled woman looked historical
in pink silk and diamonds, and there were one or tw
debutantes who became wreathed in ecstatic smiles at thy
approach of every partner. A “ decidedly gyp ” suppe r
(as Don Alameda would say) put a lustrous top-polish on
this pleasing occasion.
The first vice-regal visit to Sydney Theatre Royal
happened on 22nd inst., when a full and frocky house
and the vice-regal box draped in Jersey colours proclaimed
a special occasion. Lady Jersey wore white silk, com-
pletely covered with black lace, dark-grey gloves, and
diamond necklace and bangles, and was mainly remark-
able for studiously studying her programme whenever
the “stage-love” got up to squeezing-point. Her three
daughters wore pink frocks and bows in their hair, and
mamma and the girls all carried handsome managerial
flowers. Despite the frogs’ weather outside, the circle
was full dress. In the much-fought-over O.P. box, the
lady litigant appeared in heliotrope chiffon and diamonds.
another nice frock was of strawberry gauz'e, embroidered
in crimson filoselle, worn with a cream and satin opera-
cloak ; and a damsel of hour-glass outline was a refreshing
sight in spring-green silk and a cluster of oak-leaves in
her classical (op-knot. But one weird, Potterish belle,
got-up in black, garlanded k la prize ox with pink roses’,
unwisely left a dilapidated and muddy hoof-case
trailing out into the aisle from under her flowing robes.
“Gondoliers” went splendidly, only why does sweet-
voiced Miss Young paint her face bright pink and leave
her neck and ears pipe-clay white ? It’s clownish.
The ball in aid of the Sydney Nurses’ Home was not an
astonishing numerical success, perhaps because the even-
ing was wretchedly cheerless and sloppy, and people
dreaded beating up the Town Hall steps (which are never
sheltered) from their vehicles. Still there were enough
present to keep things going, and as furniture, decora-
tions, flowers, all necessary wines, programmes, and bill-
posters were given gratuitously by several Sydney firms,
the Home is sure to benefit largely by the ball. The
Nurses' ball will probably plume itself over the fact of its
being the first public ball patronised by Lord and Lady
Jersey, who were both there, Lady Jersey wearing a
trained gown of carubia-red brocade lit up by magnificent
diamonds. Rather a fancy-dress effect was lent to the
floor by the presence of the nurses in their lilac-print
gowns and white caps and aprons. Many of the sisters
Dora objected to the order that uniform should be worn
instead of full-dress, and certainly the print skirts looked
rather skimpy beside the billows of tulle and chiffon.
There Are one or two rags that one did more than wink
at. was of shell-pink brocade, the pattern out-
lined in silver tinsel, which formed the bodice and train,
the plain front of silver-grey merv edged at the feet with
a pink ruche of pink silk ; folds of grey and pink chiffon
finished off the bodice, while diamonds lent their own par-
ticular charm'to hair and corsage. The wearer was a tall
fair woman who carried off her clothing, as we say in
France. Another poetic outer garment had the bodice
and fan-tail train of striped lavender and white brocade,
the jupe of white Chantilly lace looped here and there
with lilac, which appeared on the shoulder and fell in
trails from the right hip; another garment one couldn’t
exactly quarrel with was in eiel-blue bengaline made very
plain with a long, thin Potter train, the bodice softened
with nicely-drawn blue chiffon studded here and there
with forget-me-nots, a “jewelled” girdle in sapphires
and turquoises finishing off the gown. All the leading
Sydney Sawboneses were present, with their wives and
One of the most interesting sights at the Sydney
Nurses’ ball, the other night, was the spectacle of a very
vary exalted personage standing meekly on one leg and
awkwardly nursing the gigantic bouquet which his
radiant partner thrust coquettishly into his arms when
she sat down to supper. If the flowers had Wen of a good
glaring crimson they might have of the
cardinal out of his love-locks, hut as it wast— '
Speaking of the Nurses’ ball, what might be called the
“ bathing-house effect,” was greatly en evidence at this
deserving festival—that is, bare-necked women with their
wraps hanging like towels round their shoulders. What
possible warmth there'is in only passing your cloak over
your back and collar-bones while you leave your snowy
buzzum still a prey to corner draughts is one of the
mysteries of feminine “ wrapping up.” But what woman
of them all dreams of fastening a Wadded cloak over her
breast-bone when the heating dance is o’er !
A Sydney Women’s Union (not to be too explicit) had a
“ nasty jar ” from Government House, the other day.
Their secretary wrote a long ranting epistle to Lady J.,
setting forth the confidence they had in her firm deter-
mination to see her sex “righted” and woman made to
wave in the front of every movement, &c., &c. But the
ardour of the,Union was considerably damped when they
received a cold answer from Lady J. expressing her
disapproval of their proceedings, and refusing to allow
them to use her name in any way. And yet there are
some people who say that Lady Jersey is the mainspring
of the present frantic female movement!
One couldn’t help turning one’s thumbs at “Adrienne
Leoouvreur,” at the SydneyQarrick on 20th inst.,although
Janet Achurch in the name-part worked like a horse in a
Saxon wig, and Charrington was about at his best as
prompter “ Mishonay.” But a deadly air of unreality and
long and awful waits wearied out the d.c., whose people
were too few to keep the house warm, and Maggie Moore
in black silk and lace and a hunch of roses and jonquils
was the only woman in evening dress.. On the stage the
frocking was dismal. As the poisoning princess, Bronton
wore two modern tea-gowns, though the date was 1730
Jerky Alice May, as the duchess (why does she pronounce
to “ toe?”), fitfully went and came in a garment reminis-
cent of a bottle of ink upset in a butcher’s shop, and even
Miss Achurch, who generally ’tires herself prettily, was
patchy. Her only real dress was the soft cream gown of
the death-scene, which went very well. By the way, I
want to point out to Adrienne that it isn’t customary for
ladies to gently clutch their lover's hand in erotic move-
ments. A vulgar young man once defined love to me as
“an itch in your heart and you can’t scratch it.” Is this
why Adrienne gently scraped-the warlike paw of Maurioe?
The first Hutcheson concert at Y.M.C.A Hall, held
on a soaking wet and sloppy evening, only drew a handful
of surprised-looking people in dingy clothes, altho’ Marian
Burton —attended by George Leitch and hubby Waterlow
—wore a handsome cloak of maize satin designed in gold
filigree, and edged with white feather fur, in which she
looked charming. Ernest played four “ pieces ” and was
encored for each, and certainly he deserved the compli-
ment. He is only a boy and performs like one, so far as
thrill and weird soulful shudder are concerned, but then
he plays conscientiously, with an almost pious regard for
all the steering-marks, set up by the composer, and the
result pleases you even if you are not exactly electrified.
Ernest may put his palpitating soul into it by and by when
some false-haired one has blighted his existence for him,
but I do not think the sympathetic will be his style ;
when matured, it probably will be mechanically brilliant.
The pianist was assisted by Colbourne-Baber in white
brocade and pink roses, Master Leader, and a fat and bald
male nightingale with a lilt like the cry of a herd of
cattle, who seemed to lift his voice up with both hands
and hurl it at the audience. Of course he sang “ For
Ever and for Ever.”
I have received Madame VVeigal’s fashion journal for
June, and regret to say that the gifted diagramist hasn’t
one positive novelty for a woman to clutch at. To be told
that the newest thing in bodices is the Louis XV. style,
when you have one, half worn-out, hanging up in your
frock-press, does not make you regard the journal as an
infallible sign-post to the extremist, and most of the hats
advocated are enough to make a black gin weep. Some
of the crochet patterns, however, may be handy for the
house fairy to whom winter and wool-work are synonyms.
From Melbourne I have received a cold and malignant
epistle mincing up the Austral Salon welcome to
’Opetoun’s little mavourneen. After fifteen pages of
scathing personal allusions to the legs and arms of the
lady artists, I was glad to see a word of praise for the
gentleman who essayed “King Arthur but the women
get nothing save abuse. Yet from another source lam
told that the show was a huge success. Which was it?
It is so very hard to get facts out of any woman.
Apropos of the vice-regal visit to the Royal, I couldn’t
help noticing that Lady Jersey sat on the right-hand side
of the V.R. box, where Carington always sat in all his
yawning glory; while Lord Jersey (he looks meeker than
ever in evening dress) occupied the left-hand chair then
occupied by Lady Carington.
Yours affectionately,
SAppiio Smith.
Tempe Refuge ball is to happen in Sydney Centennial
Hall on 29th July. Tickets are already being sold, and
Lord and Lady Jersey have promised both patronage and
presence.
The N.S.W. Officers’ Amateur theatricals in the New
Gymnasium, Victoria Barracks, on 17th inst., went off
very smoothly—one society lady pervading the stage in
quite a professional manner. Byron's “ Partner for Life ”
was the piece, and the voice of the prompter wasn’t as
audible as it usually is on such occasions.
The latest maritime wedding was that of Captain T. R.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The best on record was when Nick Judge ran Davy
Snag for £2O and the mile championship of the district.
When the challenge was issued by Nick the boys tumbled
over each other in their eagerness to put up the money.
Nick was a horse-breaker, and it was well-known that he
couldn’t run for sour apples, while Snag could break 4.40
without training. However, after the first excitement of
making the match the boys began to recollect numerous
occasions on which Nick had proved himself a particularly
downy bird, and an uneasy suspicion forced itself upon
them that things were not what they seemed, and that
Nick would at the last moment produce the right bower.
They sat up nearly all night discussing the possible and
impossible tricks which Nick might resort to, till at last
Rixon said: “1 am sure there must be a horse in it
somewhere,” whereupon Brown burst into laughter and
shouted, “Yes, and we’ll euchre him at his own game.”
At the appointed time the men faced the starter, the pistol
was fired, and away went the runners, Davy bounding
along with the light, easy stride of the professional miler,
and Nick following, with the straddling gait of
the habitual horseman. Before they had gone a
hundred yards, however, Nick’s stable-boy, mounted on
a long-tailed pony, rode out of the hush and cantered in
front of Nick, who seized the pony’s tail and roared out
to the boy to go ahead. The pony, with Nick in tow,
rapidly overhauled Davy and passed him, when suddenly
Davy’s brother, mounted on a racehorse, made his
appearance from behind a haystack and, galloping up to
Davy, called out to him to catch hold. Now the fun
began in real earnest. Nick and the pony had a long
start, but blood and condition soon began to tell. The
boys yelled and danced and shouted themselves hoarse
as Davy, hanging to the race-horse's tail, came leaping
along with giant strides and.catching Nick at the half-mile
post, passed him, and sailed home like an electrified
kangaroo. Yon never heard such laughing as there was
in Blewitt’s hotel when the stakes were paid over. And
Nick was so unmercifully chaffed about the mile-champion-
ship that he left the district shortly afterwards. Davy’s
time, taken by several reliable stop-watches, was 3.124
just about a minute better than the previous best on
record.

A growing evil of these times is the publication
of Slavin’s portrait in weekly and evening newspapers.
Some years have elapsed since the outline of that genial
(we call him genial because he can hit so hard) Irishman’s
face sent the first thrills through this continent, so by
degrees even amateur athletes have become hardened to
the spectacle, and find its constant repetition a weariness
to the spirit. The excuse for allowing Slavin to haunt
journals of the “ enterprising ” kind are weak and various.
He is generally set up, together with a descriptive
account of his age and fighting weight, directly some
mysterious “ preliminaries” have been arranged, or nego-
tiations entered into, by the broken-nosed nuisances who
are reported to be . “at his back.” Then the details are
finally settled to the satisfaction of all parties, and Slavin
is handed to the printer again. Presently he appears as
the Hero of the recent great Glove Contest, soon after
which they have got round to preliminaries once more,
followed by settled details and another victory, with a
portrait on each occasion. What makes this intermittent
calamity more aggravating is the obstinacy with which
they stick to the same old genuine view of Slavin, instead of
inserting Battenberg, or the Narbethong murderer, or
some such established attraction by way of a change. A
pugilist’s face is naturally as monotonous as six pounds of,
cold corned beef in a household comprising two souls, and
a stereotyped picture of it is more tiring than an epi-
demic. The Bulletin desires that Slavin may be with-
drawn from circulation for awhile, unless an imaginative
artist is prepared to anticipate the future by sketching
him as a prosperous pub-keeper, in about his fortieth
year. Or they might give the world a bewildering idea of
Miss Slavin, a large, ruminative young lady who towers
over the up-stairs bar of a Melbourne hotel. She deserves
to be brought into notice, not only for the sake of her fine
physique, but also on account of her commercial insight
into things and absolute freedom from hysterics. If you
say to her—“ Miss Slavin, your brother is the greatest
fighter this side of Heaven,” she will reply—“ Well, I
hope he’s making as much money at it as they say—” and
then smile dubiously at the surrounding bottles.

One of our smartest owners made a bit of a
mistake, the other day, in commissioning an up-eountry
friend to lay out a hundred pounds for him. Our friend,
the owner, had a horse—we’ll say Yarraman—running in
a race at Randwick, and picked upon the countryman to
back him, thinking to do better if the wager were taken
by a man not known to the Israelites. “ Two to one
against the field,” the betting men were yelling, when up
goes “mug” to one of them and says, “Book me two
hundred to a hundred about Yarraman.” Yarraman, at
the time, was at 7 to 1, and the language of the owner
may be better imagined than described when his horse
won and he learned how the yokel had laid his money out

The Australian daily newspaper is always at its
stupidest when dealing with racing matters “ at home.”
Melbourne Herald, for example, mentions that Mons Meg
followed up her success in the Gold Vase by running
fourth in the Ascot Gold Oup, as though the latter per-
formance were something to blow about. Knowing the
average strength of fields for the Ascot Cup The Bulletin
imagines that Mons Meg finished last.

Lord Sheffield’s influence on the forthcoming
English Eleven will be beneficial, we imagine. He seems
genuinely fond of cricketers for cricket’s sake, and, as the
“ noble patron ” of the entire company, he will not
encourage the players who put “Mr.” in front of their
names to slight the pros. Sheffield should serve to take
the rough edge off the social distinction difficulty, if he
be a man of good tact, while, in a sporting sense, he is
certain to keep the ball rolling. The professionals can do
wonderful things when there’s a wealthy ludship ready to
pay, if necessary, a £5 note for every wicket they take.

Horse-story from a recent London Life
“ During a very severe frost a few years ago, Mr. John
Milburn, farm-manager to the Durham County Asylum
(whose death has occurred this week), was saved from a
most dangerous predicament by the sagacity of his horse.
He was riding home one night, and when near his own
door the animal slipped and Mr. Milburn was thrown '
heavily and lay stunned. So keen was the frost that his
clothes practically froze to the ground, and he would
inevitably have perished, but that the faithful horse, with
its warm tongue, licked the face and head of its master
until a rescue-party arrived.” Yah !

Fame. Last week Melbourne Standard pub-
lished a small portrait with the following biographical
legend ; —“ E. Warren, who for the first time was elected
this season as captain, has been a constant player in the
Williamstown club for the past eight years, and under the
seasiders’ colours has gajned distinction as a goal-sneak.”
Fancy gaining distinction as a goal-sneak ! How should
a goal-sneak’s epitaph be written ? Let Shakespeare, who
has said something fine about everything, suggest:—
The Y.R.C. threatened to prevent the reception
of fictitious advertising entries for this year’s Melbourne
Cup, but it would seem that other counsels have pre-
vailed. Come to think of it, this means of advertising is
remarkably cheap. Every paper in Australasia publishes
the list of nominations for the Cup, and the cute entrant
of a patent medicine “prad” obtains several million
printings of its name for his fiver. The Bulletin predicts
that in a year or two the idea will be elaborated further,
and we will have a horse named somebody’s soap, or
cocoa, or electro-medical soles, winning the world’s
biggest handicap.

The “ Sowth ” Melbourne football team, which

It is related that millionaire “ Abington ” Baird,
familiarly known as “ the Squire,” was lately at a Sunday
evening “small and early,” entertaining, among others,
the secretary of a big sporting club and a “Society actor,”
who is considerably “gone on himself” as a boxer. The
talk turning somewhat naturally upon punching, the
actor made very strong running', enumerating in rapid
succession dozens of doughty knights of the mitten he
had knocked out. - “ But did you ever come across Piggy
Bettinson ?” asked the secretary. “ Did I? 1 rather
think I did—once—ask him about it,” responded the
buskin, ambiguously, but with an assuring smile. “ Well,
I’ve no occasion to,” chimed in the other, “for he was
telling me about it only last night. He said you asked
him up to your place, and that you’d got all your kids,
with their best bibs and tuckers on, sitting up on the side-
board to see you lay him out. The first round didn’t last
a minute (and it wasn’t Piggy who was ‘ out ’), when your
eldest kid slipped off his perch, and, running to the head
of the stairs, called—‘Ma, come up ; I’se afraid poor pa’s
dead!’”

How are the mighty fallen ! In the recent
Jackson-Corbett fight, at the California Athletic Club,
Frisco, Peter wore a porous plaster on his stomach. If

combat with Somebody’s Pills pasted across his manly
bosom.

The following anent J. L. Sullivan and Peter
Jackson appears in San Francisco Daily Report of 28th
May;—“An affair which came near a bare-knuckle fight
took place in Jackson’s saloon on Turk-street last night.
Sullivan and Jackson met for the first time, and they were
angry and their eyes flashed as they recognised one
another. Both were on the verge of a hard round or two
when friends interfered and separated them. At mid-
night Sullivan paid a visit to Jackson's saloon with a few
of his (Sullivan's) friends. The story, told by one who
saw the trouble and listened to the conversation, is as
follows :—“ Sullivan, as is his custom after the show, was
taking in the sights about town with a party of friends
last night and visited, among others, Peter Jackson’s
saloon. Mr. Hess, Peter’s partner, was behind the bar,
and, recognising Sullivan, the conversation naturally
turned on the recent Corbett-Jaokson light. Sullivan
began by saying with Corbett should have whipped Peter
in shorter order, and frequently referred to Peter hi
very abusive terms. ‘ Corbett ought to have licked him
sooner, and I wish he had, for I don’t like the coon, and I
don’t think he’s a lighter either.’ It appears that other
ears than Hess’s overheard the conversation, and those
ears belonged to Jackson. Jackson had been attending the
Gregaines-Turner contest, and returning to his saloon had
gone into one of the side rooms. He heard Sullivan’s talent
enter and listened to Sullivan’s conversation until he
could stand it no longer. Walking out into the bar-
room Jackson went deliberately up to the big fellow’ pre-
tending not to know him, and, tapping him on the hack,
said; ‘Look here, young man, you don’t know what you’re
talking about. You’re talking through your hat.’
Sullivan glared like a lion, but Jackson didn’t flinch.
Sullivan evidently didn’t know he was talking to Jack-
son and, giving him a contemptuous lookj roared
‘Who are you talking to? I don’t stand that sort of
thing from your sort of people.’ ‘ Well,’said Jackson,
determinedly, ‘ I’m talking to you and I repeat that you
are talking through your hat.’ A fight looked imminent
at this moment, and Sullivan’s friends stepped in between
the two men and tried to separate them. Jackson, how-
ever, would not listen to the peacemakers and repeated
to Sullivan, ‘You are talking through your hat.’
Sullivan at once took off his coat, but Jackson, quick as
u flash, opened his vest and was on the point of pulling
off both coat and vest when friends again crowded round
Sullivan and induced him to leave the saloon, and lie
didn’t leave unwillingly either. Hess cooled Jackson off,
and in five minutes everything w’as going as usual.”

Around De Mestre’s name the turfite wreaths a
host of recollections. Only a few’ years back he had over
100 thoroughbreds in training, or under his care.
Romance exudes from the period when De Mestre, Tait,

the turf.

Yet another pugilistic farce. There is a high
admission-fee. The men are trained to the hour. Their
muscles stand out like ropes and the pugs seem fit to
fight for hours for a prize that some years back would
have been a little fortune. Yet what do we find? A lot
of sparring, and one goes down to a hit under the jaw,
rolls over and stays there until after the call of time.
Like pony-racing, this business is about played out, apd
so it will prove w’hen the public comes to know that the
side-wagers are in most cases put up by certain members
of certain clubs. Pugs walk about now in broadcloth and
tall hats, put up at the best hotels, and make stacks
of money. When the public come to size them up
properly the halls will be “ to let.”

Judging from the accounts by the mail of the
Jackson-Corbett fight, Jackson appears to be out of it as
a champion, having apparently lost the rather small
amount of “devil” he formerly possessed in his hitting
power, to back up his wonderful boxing ability. It is
pretty evident that he fought for a draw.

Slavin has now reached the top rung of the
slugging ladder, and, to our way of thinking, no Yankee
or "Englishman who is not tired of life will try to shift
him. That good-tempered, quiet lamb, Patrick Francis
Card. Slavin, will find things hang a bit, unless another
steam battering-ram can be prevailed upon to cross the
stream and explain that there is no room for two of their
class on this earth. It would indeed be sport for the
gods. We would back the house against any two of the
Divine Sara’s or a dozen of Varley’s. Let the posters be
worded:—“Slavin v. Goddard. One to be killed or no
fight. Admission, £lO 10s. For gentlemen only.”

A certain Melbourne man has given away more
prizes for slugging exhibitions than all the other sports
together in Australia, and in return he asks no more
than that he may be allowed to stand referee. Truly
some rich men are queer cranks.

The treatment disclosed is unfolded in the “HEALTH PAMPHLET, ; “-a condensed prescription of 48 pages To read and study this pamphlet is to
gain a fund of physiological, pathological and therapeutical knowledge that a hundred times the cost of the pamphlet would not purchase from its owner could
it be given back and blotted from his memory.

iBE it |nnwn tfyclt for the purpose of obtaining from Dr. A. Wilford Hall the knowledge of hit
hygienic discovery, and for his treatment of health and longevity, with the pamphlet unfolding the same,
I hereby pledge my word and honor not to show the pamphlet nor reveal its contents to anyone, nor allow
it to be seen by any person; nor will I use the treatment with any others except the members of my own
family, from each of whom a promise shall be exacted not to reveal the treatment to others.
This pledge does not debar the physician who may purchase the pamphlet from using the
treatment with his patients, provided, however, he does not show the pamphlet nor reveal to them the
rationale of the treatment.

We would respectfully refer as to our reliability to the Editor of this paper. . I
The following testimonials from ministers, doctors, and private persons speak for
selves and they are but a drop in the bucket of the thousands received :
The distinguished pulpit-orator and evangelist,
Rev. Miles Grant, Boston, Mass., writes,
e *r 0 u o "hing your wonderful discovery, I take much
pleasure in saying, I am delighted with its effects upon
mv system. I sent for it that I might know its influence
on a healthy person. I have now used it about three
months, and intend to continue its use during my mortal
life The treatment produces a general refreshing, in-
vigorating effect; sharpens my appetite, sweetens my
sleep, and makes me feel as though 1 had a new lease of
life. I have persuaded several of my brethren of the
ministry to send for your Health-Pamphlet, and so far as
I have heard from them they are exceedingly pleased.
One of them said to me a few days ago, I would not
take 860 for it. It knocks the bottom out of disease. I
can say for myself I never spent cash to better advantage
than when I bought your pamphlet.—Your brother in
Christ, Miles Grant.”
Dr. J. W. Graves, Parsons, Kansas, writes ;
“ Dear Dr. Hall,— After a careful reading of your
pamphlet, which came to hand a few weeks ago, I became
•o delighted with the far-reaching effects of its marvellous
physiological revelations, that I at once ordered six of my
patients, who were suffering with consumption, to com-
mence the use of the treatment. lam happy to say that
they are all improving and doing well. You have done a
great work for afflicted humanity.-Your fraternal friend,
J. W. Graves, M.D.”
Rev. Thos. Nield, Livonia, Ind., writes :
“ At the time I received your pamphlet on Health andl
Longevity, 1 was suffering from internal piles. After
Duttintryour treatment into practice three times I bade
my trouble good-bye, and have not felt it since I have
only to add, from practical experience, during the short
time I have owned your pamphlet, that I have more faith
in vour system of treatment than in all the medicines of
all the doctors on earth combined.-Yours very truly.
Xnoi. Nibld.”
Rev. A. L. Cole, D.D., M.D., Santa Ana, Cal.,
sends his second endorsement of the new pam-
phlet after another month’s practice of the treat-
ment, as follows: —
“ Dear Dr. Hall,—l have nothing to take back from
my letter as printed in the July ‘Microcosm.’ Your
treatment is the first expression of the science of thera-
peutics I have ever seen in print, or have ever put
into practice that appeals to my judgment as unquali-
fiedly rational. It goes directly to the cause of all forms
of disease and removes it by aiding and abetting nature,
rather than provoking a conflict among the vital powers
as in the case of drug-medication. This I call genuine
remedial science. For nearly twenty-five years I have
been a consecutively tormented invalid, and I can say in
all candour and truth that the first real freedom from suf-
fering that I have experienced in all this time has been
since adopting your treatment. I rejoice beyond words
within my power of expression ; and I honestly believe
that under God you have done more in that pamphlet
than all the doctors of the world for the relief of suffering
humanity. The treatment in my own case is to me the
wonder of wonders ! The $4 I paid for the pamphlet was
the best spent money of my whole life. You are at liberty
to print this, which I declare to be the literal truth upon
the honour of a man and a Christian. God bless you in
your beneficent work.” — A. L. Oolb.
Rev. Geo. Cook, of Millican, Texas, who was
struck with what the doctors supposed to be a
fatal paralytic shock, now sends his seventh order
for pamphlets, and writes ;
“ Dear Friend, Dr. Hall,— lnclosed find the money for
three more pamphlets with pledges signed. My health is
now quite restored. Others here who have sent for the
pamphlet are just beginning to try the treatment, and
all are pleased with it. I will report further soon, and
j send for a number of pamphlets.—Yours truly, Gborob
*'Cook.”
Let it be distinctly understood that this is no
scheme of quackery to draw money out of the
afflicted, nor is it any sort of a patent medicine
humbug, since there is not a grain of medicine of any
kind required in the treatment. Notwithstanding
this fact, it takes directly hold of the worst cases
of constipation, dyspepsia, liver complaints, head-
aches, heart disease, incipient consumption,
diabetes, and Bright’s disease of the kidneys, in-
cluding fevers and inflammation of the lungs, and
of other internal organs—not by attacking these
so-called diseases directly, but by radically neutra-
lising and removing their causes, thus allowing
nature herself to do her work unimpeded.
We now simply repeat that the new treatment
acts so radically and fundamentally upon the vital
circulation without the least danger to the most
delicate constitution, that there is not a form of
disease that flesh is heir to, which will not be
affected favorably to the patient by an intelligent
use of this method of treatment.
In selling this Pamphlet we are obliged to re-
require a “Pledge of Honor” from those purchas-
ing it, not to show or reveal its contents outside
of their own families. This is for our own protec-
tion, and as the only means by which our just
rights in the discovery can be maintained.
Doctors, of course, who purchase are not debarred
from using the treatment in their own practice,
providing they do not show the pamphlet or do not
reveal the rationale of the treatment.
Dr. J. M. Peebles, whose Sanitorium, as the
centre of his enormous medical practice, is at
Hammonton, N.J., and who admittedly is one of
the most learned physicians and surgeons now
living, has sent for our pamphlet and has received
it as a physiological revelation. He writes:
“Your health pamphlet dropped in upon me like a
healing ray of sunshine. I read it with avidity, and at
once put your treatment into practice, and it is scarcely
necessary to say I found it all you recommended it to be
and more. It is not only pathological, physiological, and
hygienic, but rational. Already have I derived great
personal benefit from your discovery.—Truly yours, J.
M. Pebbles, M.D.”
[Dr. Peebles is a graduate of several medical colleges!
has circumnavigated the earth three times in the interests
of therapeutical and pathological science, and is the
author of eleven volumes on the subject, the last being
“How to Live a Century and Grow Old Gracefully”—a
work which we have read with profound interest. The
indorsement of our pamphlet and treatment by such a
distinguished authority surely needs no comment.]
Rev. M. Fernsler, Schafferstown, Pa., writes :
“Dr. A. Wilford Hall. Dear Sir,—Since receiving
your pamphlet I have carefully tested your treatment
upon myself. For more than twenty years 1 have been a
sufferer. My trouble has been torpid liver, indigestion,
pain across the kidneys, at times dizziness, with
occasional heart trouble, &c. With gladness unspeakable
I assure you I already find myself almost a new man ; and
I can never pay the debt of gratitude I owe you for the
blessing you have conferred upon me. I want to help
spread the knowledge of this discovery, and if you will
send me'some blank Pledges of Honor I will let my
afflicted neighbours know about thje great remedy that is
in store for them.—Yours very truly, M. Fernslbr.”
DR. R. E. STEVENS’ INDORSEMENT.
Dr. Stevens, of Syracuse, N.Y., was the first
M.D. to whom we revealed the new treatment —
more than 20 years ago. In writing to a friend,
about a year ago, he gives the following :
***** “Nearly twenty years ago in this city Dr. A.
Wilford Hall gave me privately a detailed history of a
hygienic treatment he had discovered and adopted some
twenty years' before, and which he had practised con-
tinuously upon himself up to that time. The history
included an account of the failure of the health, the
reasonings and conclusions which led him to adopt the
treatment, his rapid restoration to health, &c. From the
time of his first mention of it to me I have been entirely
satisfied that it saved him from a lingering consumption
and death ; and that in the years following, as I have evi-
dence to satisfy me, its continued practice has so affected
the nutrient and eliminating functions as to give to his
physical structure a greater degree of solidity, or, in
other words, a higher specific gravity than that possessed
by any other man living. I learn that he has persistently
continued the treatment to the present time—forty years
in all—and that his present health and vigorous condition
may rightfully be compared to the ‘bloom of youth,’
though he is nearly seventy years of age. The tests I
have made of the treatment upon myself and in my prac-
tice in the twenty years past, have convinced me that
great practical benefit may be derived by members of the
medical profession and others from a careful study of the
rationale of the treatment as discovered by Dr. Hall, the
details of which he proposes to give in his forthcoming
book. A debt of gratitude will surely be due to him for
whatever scientific advances he may be able to unfold in
the line of assisting nature to ward off disease, and in the
restoration of health.— R. F. Stevens, M.D.”
Rev. M. A. Smith, pastor M.E. Church, South,
at McAlester, Ind. Ter., writes :
“Inclosed please find signed pledge of Rev. W. H.
Hicks, our Congregational minister, and the money for
his pamphlet. * * * I am not a bit surprised to see in
the June ‘Microcosm’ the wonderful things your new
discovery is accomplishing for those who have tried the
treatment. 1 want to tell you with tears of joy what it
has done for my wife. For about a year she has been
regarded as a hopeless consumptive. Our physicians had
given her up as incurable. She had patiently and reso-

“ Dear Dr. Hall,— l have received and read your won-
derful pamphlet on health and longevity. I am very
thankful that I was somewhat acquainted with your
writings, having read the ‘ Problem of Human Life ’ and
some numbers of the earlier volumes of the ‘ Microcosm.’
Had I not known of you through your previous dis-
coveries in science I fear I should nave given little atten-
tion to this great and priceless physiological discovery
which is destined to do so much for suffering humanity.
You will hear from me again soon.—Respectfully yours,
Alison C. Roe.”

fV. Cave ndish, P.0.80x 161, Melbourne
Labour Disputes and the Way Out.
The worker in glutted centres of population looks
longingly to the sheepwalk that has so many
potentialities for him if it were only his. Bat
unfortunately private property in land compels
the pinched city operative to tread in the old
groove for his crust and to die in the h im jsj that
social conditions have fitted on him. The dis-
content of that thwarted worker has found ex-
pression in many forms, and now a workman—a
shearer and miner and withal a scholar and a
business genius, one Arthur Tremayne—has. after
12 months’hard work, succeeded in giving practical
form to a radical remedy for the distresses of the
city-bound wage-earner— and thisremedy is nothing
more nor less than a Co-operativelrrigation Colony.
The institution is now on a thoroughly sound
basis and has been registered un.der the Provident
Societies Act as the Co-operative Irrigation and
Mercantile Society of Australia. The directorate
consists of 18 members made up of six of each of
the representatives of Co-operative Capitalism,
Trades and Labour Unions, and Government
officials and Friendly Societies, and includes Pro ■
fessor Kernot, of Melbourne University ;W. G.
Spence, of the Miners’ and Shearers’ Unions ; and
Alex. Sutherland, M.A., Carlton College. Mr.
Cowdery, Vice-President of the Melbourne Cham-
ber of Commerce, and the Hon. Simon Fraser are
also prospective directors. The credit of formu-
lating and bringing into active operation the
scheme is entirely due to Mr. Tremayne, man iger
of the Society, and after him to the representa-
tives of capital, who have by their present action
evidenced a desire to adopt the profit-sharing
system. The first issue of the Society’s shares is
£IOO,OOO of £1 each, most of which have been
allotted. The objects of the Society are to
settle the people oh irrigated land, to compass
a more equitable distribution of profits between
the capitalist and the labourer, and to reduce to
actual cost the prices of necessaries to members
and settlers. The society is endeavouring to
secure a tract of 250,000 acres of magnificent soil
on the river Murray, a stream emptying seven
billions of gallons daily in the rainy season into
Lake Alexandrina. Other colonies will be later
established in other portions of Australia, and
we may yet see as a result of this truly national
undertaking the deceptive Darling locked for all
its length, with its waters backed up in
irrigating channels and the once-baked soil of its
banks and flats blooming with flowers, and run-
ning wine and oil (olive, by the way). Already
three colonies are in working order and partly
settled, viz., Riverside (Vic.), 26 families (12 non-
resident), and planted with 23,800 raisin-grape
vines, 20,000 cuttings same, 4000 Zante currants,
912 apricots, (550 figs, 528 peaches, 565
prunes, 450 pears, 360 apples, 100 quince,
70 cherries, 100 oranges and lemons, and 350
almonds. The other colonies, Torrumbarry
(Vic.) and Mount Arapiles (Vic.) are also par-
tially settled and planted. The existing colonies
and the larger ones to be started are and will be
worked on the same basis as those at Mildura and
Renmark, with this difference —that while a
definite interest of 10 per cent, will be paid to
capital, the nett profits will be divided amongst
the workers. The system actually means the
federation of labour and capital secured for the
first time in Australia. The business of the
Society is being developed in a most thorough
manner. Two representatives have been sent to
England, one being stationed in the north, the
centre of the Co-operative people, and the other
in London. There are over 20 branch offices in
Australian provincial towns, and these will have
the charge of an enormous staff appointed to
canvas 250,000 of the Australian workers.
The management informs ns that snb-agents
are wanted in every town where not now
represented. The rules of the Society are
simple revelations —part of all that goes from
it comes back to it. Wholesale co-operative
stores are to be opened on the vaii jus settlements,
so that the settler shall pay only actual cost for his
necessaries, and then participate in the profits on
goods sold to the misguided man who is not a
member. Ten per cent, of every shilling paid by
the Society in wages must be invested in the
Society or its land, and the Workers’ Bank is
ready to received on deposit all that can be spared
from the remainder. No person can hold more
than 200 shares, nor transfer any of them—if a
member desires to withdraw, the Society calls in
the shares and pays him the value thereof to
date. Every shilling arising from the sale of
township lots will be utilised for development
purposes, or for improving the township itself.
The irrigated lands can be purchased outright,
or by instalments extending over a term of
years—the purchaser can work his purchase per-
sonally, or have it done for him by the Society’s
labourers, so that he need not visit his property
until it has become a productive one. And if a
man has no money, but only an ability and will-
ingness to work, the Society says it can afford to
take him in hand all the same, and requests him
to write. The uses and prospective products of
this irrigated land are legion. Oranges, for
instance—6o trees go to the acre, £lO to £l4 per
tree per season is a fair average in America, and a
tree will bear for two centuries. Olives have
produced at San Diego (Cal.) 250 gallons of oil to
the acre, and oil is worth £1 per gallon, and is
becoming more valuable as Australians decrease
indulgence in that irrational and English habit of
inordinate meat-_eating. The olive is the great
substitute for animal food in Southern Europe—
Franco produces £20,000,000 worth of oil a year.
The Winegrape—the largest vineyard in France—
is 54 acres in area, which produces £20,000 a year
in wine. Australia imports £IOO,OOO Worth of
raisin-grapes annually, and that subject to an
import tax of twopence per lb.; and the annual
value of imported canned and dried fruits is half
a million of money. These figures can’t lie. We
have no fruit or vegetable canning or dried-fruit
factories in Australia to speak of, no more than
we have a rational market-garden not tilled
by Chinamen or a chicken-raising farm worked on
sensible lines. There is an irrigated garden in
Adelaide that could give the produce of the
Eastern Provinces points and win easily. Besides
all the well-known fruits, great silk-skinned
apricots, hazel, filbert, and Barcelona nuts, limes,
walnuts, almonds, shaddocks, cumquats, and
guavas grow in profusion, and pumpkins 1501bs. in
weight have been frequently turned out. Mr. W.
B. Chaff ey said four years back : “I expect to see
a million and a-half acres of land tilled on the
Murray before long, and if the supply is assured,
I have no doubt as to the call of the market.”
The man with a 10-acre lot of irrigated country
under cultivation with a matchless climate such
as the Murray provides, is a more prosperous and
independent man than the ordinary city shop-
keeper, and can attain a condition of independence
that is, in this age of competition, ideal. #

BUCKINGHAM PAEK ESTATE,
MEDLOW (£>lue Mountains).
This charming Estate has its Railway Platform almost
adjoining, and its level land proves it to be eminently
adapted for residential purposes. Nature seems to have
lavished all her varied charms on BUCKINGHAM PARK,
which is, without exception, the CREAM or PICKED
SPOT on the BLUE MOUNTAINS.
BUCKINGHAM PARK ESTATE
Is beautifully surveyed. The Allotments are unusually
large-from 100 up to 100 feet frontages, with long depths
thus enabling buyers to have Garden, Tennis Lawns,
etc., if they so desire. In fact, it may be truly said, there
is no finer Residential Land on the Mountains.
The BELGRAVIA HOTEL, MEDLO'.V, which cost £4OOO,
is now open for visitors, and is the First Hotel on the
Mountains supplied, with the Electric Light, and the
Proprietor is willing to supply any cottages built on the
estate with the electric light. Two elegant Villas are
now nearly finished on this estate. The rapid advance in
the price of land at BLACKHEATH during the past three
years, amounting to fully 300 per cent., clearly shows that
early buyers at Buckingham Park will make a splendid
investment. Title is TORRENS, and the terms are liberal
and to suit buyers. For particulars, apply to the Pro-

The Remittance Man's Alimentary
Annuity.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
There is a halo of glory around the man who
gets money from home.” There are many such
men who are always getting (present participle)
mo , n .ey which never arrives. One such impostor is
a hideous German, who has come into several
fortunes. He did not receive the last one (or any
other) because the Council had told him he would
have to go home to get it, and, being a deserter,
• e J?' rec * Spandau or other military prisons,
ihis Deutscher is worth describing, although he
has nothing to do with our poor dead Remittance
Man. German Bill is six feet in height and his
colour is that of a patient who has recovered from
yellow-fever under a fearful salivation by mercury,
ills nose is straight down from his forehead until
within half an inch of the end and then it shoots
out at right angles. He is never tidy, never clean,
always ugly and, of course par 'consequence, a
cook. But he has redeeming points: he can
bring out a low note from the depths of the
pylorus and frighten children into fits ; and he has
IV.To, Fntz,’ that smokes a pipe and waltzes to
the BlaueDanube.” To Capricorn with German
Bill, let us tackle oub man. I give you the
etory as he told it to me a few days
a ?°> °V; V l6 of May. Being an admirer
ot truth, but at the same time having a holy
horror of profanity, I do not know how to give
his exact words without doing injury to my feel-
ings and perhaps shocking the ears of my more
sensitive readers. However, imagine me in a
traveller s hut at Rumgong, and making tea and
damper for a poor fellow sick unto death. This is
how he went on :
“ A shame a disgrace. To think that the sneak-
ing, prayerful, hypocritical Scotch lawyers and
elders or deacons or, blast them, whatever they
are should have persuaded my old uncle, the
Bishop, to leave such an iniquitous will. Bishop !
no, he wasn’t a bishop, you idiot. We’ve no
bishops in the Presbyterian Church. But my
sister Molly, Mary Dempster, gave him that nick-
name, and I, Andrew Dempster, used to address
**' ,n Rs My Lord, or sometimes, James Crossford.
1 hat s where he lived and died. IPs wife, my
aunt, left me a few hundreds. The Dari in”'
whalers know how I spent it; and soon the news
went home, and the outcome was that instead of
getting a hundred or two, with which I could
have even gone home and perhaps had a shake of
the elbow at Monte Carlo, he’s left me the sura of
seven hundred to purchase an annuity. Rest
ms soul in peace! He knew not what he
did, and I forgive him, yea, and until seventy
times seven. I think I’m off my dot. Isn’t it
a sign of approaching dissolution when you begin
thinking of boyhcd ? Ju t now I saw Geordy
Drysdale and Tom Hodge and Annie
MacLellan and all the lassies listening to the
Bishop’s open-air preaching, just as distinctly as
i see you. L>ut I must tell you before Igo to
S e t e^7 1 0,0 * eel s^epy— about this annuity.
‘Oh! the wording of that will and the
horrible, pawky prolixity of the lawyer's letter.
Ihe trustees—d n them !—are my own first
cousins. If they had been insuring my life they’d
haveliad me examined, and I don’t believe any
office would take it. But they first handed those
seven solid centuries to an insurance-office, who
coolly tell me I’m to live twenty years. Shall I
see twenty months? or weeks? or days? oi
hours? And, listen, the annuity is to be strictly
alimentary. For alimentation they send me a
paper to fill up and sign before a banker. I’ve
done so. Ihe whisky and exes, waiting round
that bank cost me one half-year’s payment. And
I can’t forestall on mortgage that miserable divi-
dend. There’s one clause in the will that’s a bit
of balm to my wounded soul. It’s not attachable by
my creditors ! I hat’s the old boy’s doing. He
know me. So now I have to go whaling till that
paper goes to Crossford, and thence to London
and, curse them, it’s got to be uplifted in Edin-
burgh. What they’ll do then I don’t know.
Probably send it out here, addressed to Rumgong
Sydney, Melbourne, South Australia. They
don’t know antipodean geography in Lanarkshire.
And I’ve got to show myself in Narandera twice
a year. 1 hat’s two drunks. Three or four ought
to kill mo : in fact, have killed me. You’ve read
“ Warren’s Miscellanies, ’’ain’tit, or is itthe ‘‘Diary
of a Late Physician ” ? Well, I’ve got the aura.
When I close my eyes, I’m steepleohasing on
Kilhecrankie, the roan pony, that Colonel, beg
pardon, General Probyn gave me. When he falls,
I end my race. The combat will then be o’er.
Here, lam at the hymns. Last night I repeated
all the psalms I was so often whopped for. Katy
Dunn and .lessie Macfarlane were hearing me
and Peggy Mitchell was knitting in the corner!
She had a bunch of feathers in her apron-strings,
and stuck the spare needles in them. I like
that psalm about waiting more than they that
wait the morning light to see. It puts me
in mind of waiting for the pubs, to open. David
was a boozer. I think I’ll go to Scotland
or India. Good night. A ten-pound saddle just
makes the weight. Let go his head. Throw the
whip at me, 111 catch it. Now, then, Killiecrankie,
I’ll change your name to the Alimentary Annuity!
We’re off.” And with that rare smile on his
placid face, that first showed his white teeth and
caused a slight twitching of the edges of his lips
my old chum Andrew Dempster, of Easter and
Wester Haughs, fell asleep. Time, 1 p.m. At
five he had some tea, no bread or meat, and said
it was.a fast-day because it preceded a feast; the
payments being due on the loth of May and the
11th November. Then he said : “Bust mo if I
know what makes me so sleepy. I think I’ll sleep
my brains away. In fact, I’m cronk and crank. ’,
So he laid his head on his arms and was still until
late in the night. I had gone to bed, but had a
slush-lamp burning. At exactly midnight Andy
flopped down on his bunk and began—“ Amen,
amen, dico vohis: qui in ostia per }Mi'tas non
ingrcditur sed ascendit aliunde hallo, you here
again ? Safe over that one, next is a double.
Alimentary Annuity, late Killiecrankie. Now
the water. Looks broad, deep and shining
Believe it’s the Jordan, or Lethe. It’s the Shining
River. Over ! safe ! ” and Andrew Dempster, late
of the Easter and Wester Haughs, required no
more legacies, Alimentary or other.

What folly it would be to cut grass with a pair of scissors! Yet peo-
ple do equally silly things every day. Modern progress has grown up
from the hooked sickle to the swinging scythe and thence to the lawn
mower. So don’t use scissors!
But do you use SAPOLIO ? If you don’t you are as much behind the
age as if you cut grass with a dinner knife. Once there were no soaps.
Then one soap served all purposes. Now the sensible folks use one soap
in the toilet, another in the tub, one soap in the stables, and SAPOLIO
for all scouring and house-cleaning.

Sunday Afternoon in
Melbourne.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Compared with Sydney, Melbourne is
poorly provided with Sunday afternoon resorts;
apart from the popular and übiquitous public-
house, the Sunday-school, and the malodorous but
instructive Zoo., where a lot of discouraged-look-
ing animals and a great variety of dejected birds
in various stages of dyspepsia and decay are open
to inspection from noon till sundown, there isnot,
at this season of the year, a public place within or
without the “ Marvellous ” where the ungodly can
disport with any physical comfort or mental
profit, and, as the Zoo. is apt to pall after a dozen
visits and fifty ineffectual attempts to awake the
crocodile from his oppressive lethargy, and many
fruitless endeavours to make the lion get up and
roar and the tiger dispel his ennui , by poking
his leading features up with a stick, the
thoughtful, middle-aged man, seeking innocent
recreation, falls back in time upon the grog-shop
or the Sunday-school. And again, as all men
cannot take upon themselves to point out to a
class of obtuse and weary small boys wherein they
should and should not emulate the prophets, nor
appreciate the ecstacy of ocular and oscular flirta-
tion with the sweet young thing in the fashionable
hat and gold bangles who teaches moral precepts
to the envious little girls, we find a large and in-
creasing pressure of popularity on the back-
entrance of the pub ; but here again the big beer
and the “dim religious light” fail to fascinate
numerous exacting minds, and we have a great
residue of bored citizens left, who, for the lack of
other attractions, resort to bed on the Sabbath
afternoon, in deep disgust, and contract indiges-
tion and liver-complaint by sleeping directly after
meals.
Very few young men go to Sunday-school in
search of relaxation, and those who do are tall,
pale youths who take to long, black coats and
belltoppcrs very early in life, and eventually be-
come either undertakers, parsons, or lay co-respon-
dents in divorce. Most of the young fellows
lean up against corners, and smoke and hang out
till Monday; but some frequent the Sandridge
railway pier.
The fact that so ghastly a place as the Sand-
ridge Pier is a popular Sunday afternoon resort
should be sufficient evidence of the necessity
of something being done to mitigate -the solemn
stupidity of the Melbourne Sabbath and make the
tax-payer less earnestly wish himself dead on the
day of rest. Sandridge Pier is a barren pile of
planks jutting out into a usually mud-coloured
sea; it has some ships tethered against it, and
commands a view of another pier to the left, a
spread of tainted bay in front, and a great waste
place to the right. Saving when a misguided
shark gets tangled up amongst the piles and
engenders a fleeting and fictitious excitement by
nearly rooting up the whole structure, this resort
is a dull and dreary repetition of last Sunday
afternoon, and has been so for very many weary
years. Yet thither flock the young people on the
seventh day, and endeavour to beguile the lagging
hours by walking solemnly up one side and
strolling soberly down the other— a performance
varied occasionally in the case of young men who
perch along the fence, and seek release from the
prevailing depression by passing painful criti-
cisms on the dress and general deportment of the
mildest and most submissive-looking passers-by.
It is foolish to take to heart any objections a con-
gregation of disinterested young men may express
regarding your boots or the hang of your gar-
ments when you are out for the day. Such objec-
tions really do not moan much: the young men
being bored, and hungry for mental relaxation,
are apt to carp at trifles, but some people feel
those things keenly, and, after being requested to
“ hitch up their pants” or “ let down their socks,”
lose interest in their surroundings and ache to be
home and alone. A young friend of mine went
out in a new belltopper last Sunday afternoon.
It was a beautiful hat, and had cost the young
banker a lot of wages, and he was very proud of
it, indeed. He returned home about an hour
later, looking blighted, and there took his new hat
off and put it on the fire. There was no more
pleasure for him in that hat—he’d been to Sand-
ridge Pier.
» * #
A noticeable feature of the afternoon’s
entertainment on the pier is the fact that the
sexes keep themselves severely apart. In a few
isolated instances a young gallant may be seen
accompanying a chosen fair in her peregrinations
up and down, but he is ignorant of the manners
and customs of the place, and so palpably a
stranger and a “mug,” that he comes in for more
than ordinary attention and playful .comment.
The regular attendants do not run in couples; the
young men and the maidens seems to know each
other, and exchange facetious allusions in passing,
such as—“ How do, Poll ? Where did yer spring
the beaver?” or, “Strike me fat, Kitty, you are
a bit of stuff!” to which pleasantries the ladies
make chaste and appropriate response, but the
gentlemen in their nonchalance and lassitude ex-
tend their courtesies no further, being evidently too
confident of the strength of their positions in the
estimation of the other sex to condescend to
trifling conventionalities.
For years the pier has been regarded as a public
rostrum, to which frowsy individuals of peculiar
grammar and every shade and grade of opinion
may repair to air their sentiments and come down
in all the fury of wild rhetoric and mixed metaphor
on things celestial and terrestrial. There the burn-
ing question of Jonah and the whale has been
settled in accordance with all phases of belief and
unbelief, existing governments have been flaunted
—stripped of all subterfuge—in their ghastly
nakedness before the eyes and minds of the pro-
letariat, whilst most people drifted past and never
seemed to hear the various tidings of great joy or
heed the zealous declaimers.
One Sunday, when I was younger, I visited the
pier and heard a large dark man with the configu-
ration of a melo-dramatic outlaw, roaring from a
pile in hysterical fury, and I asked where were
the police—l wanted to give the man in charge
for being illegally at large in the colony and a
menace to life and limb. When the police came
they told me he was an itinerant evangelist preach-
ing the gospel of peace, and quite harmless accord-
ing to the highest authorities. I was surprised.
£
Of late, however, the pier has been robbed o 1
the little diversity which such interesting propa-
gandists afforded it, and now only a temperance
fanatic of wonderful staying powers and an aged
and uninteresting lady who has started out on a
Social Purity basis, bearing a snow-white banner
with an auger rampant, and who occasionally
collects herself on an eminence to discourse on
delicate questions, contend to break the placid
flow of people wandering aimlessly up one side and
drifting wearily down the other.
The Social Purity enthusiast is a spare, iron-
grey lady with a fixed eye that glares straight
ahead like a policeman’s lantern in a pantry, and
the grounds of her complaint are the suppositions
that Melbourne is a sink of iniquity, and that
there is a lot of disguised infamy going on in high
places. She proposes wiping the town clean,
abolishing all the bold, bad men, and starting a-
fresh.
The man who arises with unswerving regularity
to pass a few remarks about the curse of drink is
a familiar feature. He is the same old bore who
has been rising to remark since the time of
Moses, and he has already succeeded in con-
vincing several people that the curse of drink
—the dreadful outcome of the pernicious
habit of drinking alcoholic stimulants, so pre-
valent in modern society, is the temperance
orator. lam one of Lis converts. Nobody stops
to listen to this crank now, except three or four
dazed individuals who come with him and seem
to be fascinated by the power of his awful jaw;
but he does not care particularly about an au-
dience —he only wants to get up there and talk ; it
is necessary for his complaint that he should do
so, and if he can run on for an hour or two unin-
terruptedly he is quite content. He takes his
stand at the head of the pier, closes his eyes to
external circumstances, and lets his feelings loose;
and he leaks ruinous, heart-breaking statistics,
and ghastly examples, and a great, oppressive
incubus of figures as long as his information lasts,
and his several admirers stand round, under the
influence, with their mouths wide open to grasp
the situation, and look like an asylum out for an
airing. Meanwhile the people come and go un-
awed by the gruesome prognostications of the
prophet of slops. Up and back! Up and
back!! Let us join in the “demnition grind,”
and enjoy the full advantages of this popular
resort —one of the few that puritanical Melbourne

■
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in The newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
ar-d has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by com par ng
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact —
easily ascertainable from any postal official —that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

SV.OINV CERTIFICATE.— One of Thousands more.
Noble-strect, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, ISBS.
To 11. F. Kuoelmanx, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good , but I became worse every day, wasting away until
1 became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill 1 consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in “March last. At the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. Prom that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.
