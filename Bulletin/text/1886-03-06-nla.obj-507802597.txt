An Historical Parallel.
The Bulle
SATURDAY, MARCH 6, 1886.
The prosecution of Mr. H. M. Hyndman, the
Social Revolutionist, recalls some of the
most interesting and infamous chapters in
the English history of the last hundred
years. When William Pitt, the Tory
ruled the destinies of Great Britain, and
scourged Europe with perpetual conspira-
cies and wars, having no other object than
to stamp out the results and principles of
the French Revolution, and to restore the
Bourbons with their system of Divine right
to oppress, he was mortally afraid of
debating societies! Pitt, who trampled
upon liberty in England as elsewhere with
ruthless violence, had suppressed all such
societies. He died; his funeral was on
a Saturday, and on the following Monday
the debating societies re-opened. Cyrus
Redding, in his “ Recollections,” narrates
how, previously, these meetings
“Could not be held, for fear of informers, who
were ready to swear to words which were certain
to be construed into sedition, or topics connected
with Jacobinical principles, the bugbears of the
time. Such were Parliamentary Reform, and,
indeed, the discussion of any political grievance
whatever.”
Honest Mr. Redding comments :
"The Government is timorous that cannot resist
the wordy attacks of the advocates of impracti-
eable tr iths. I have lived to see some of the
treasons ut that time bee ime the laws of the
land.”
Anachronistic Cyrus! How could “im-
practicable ” truths ever become the law of
the land? The prejudices of the dominant
class—imitated as they always are by a
stupid or servile following, consisting of the
jackals who feed on the scraps and entrails
of that great prey of plunder which the
privileged classes feed upon—are worth re-
calling. Henry Cockburn, in his “Memoirs,”
mentions how Dr. Alexander Adam, rector
of the Edinburgh High School, when he was
a pupil there, was regarded with suspicion
and disfavour. The poor schoolmaster was
no politician: he lived in the past, and for
Mm the affairs of his own times had scarcely
any interest. Yet, because he, as a teacher
of Greek and Roman literature, discoursed
academically of liberty, the people, the ex-
pulsion of the Tarquins, and of republics,
Ms very pupils were encouraged to report
upon his discourses, and he was looked at
askance.
♦ * *
People who are fond of asserting that
Britons never shall he slaves are equally
fain to assert that Britons never have been
slaves. Why, they are slaves to-day, did
they but know the truth. There are enact-
ments in the Statute Book efficacious to
quench every supposed right which they
believe themselves permitted to enjoy.
These enactments are allowed to lie latent
until urgently required, hut they exist none
the less. The Constitution is no more pro-
tection to civil rights than a wall of wattle
and daub is against wild beasts. Such a
wall may look impenetrable from inside or
out, but when the attack is made, it shivers
to pieces. Parliament, which in no wise
really represents the people of England, can
always set aside the Constitution, and
always does so, when a real danger to pri-
vilege and plunder seems to threaten. A
charge of sedition never fails, except when
uo amount of packing can secure a jury
which will not resolutely oppose authority
““aye, even authority on the Bench. In
1793-4, the infamous State trials for
“sedition ” were held in Scotland, with
the result of sending to Botany Bay,
James Muir, a noble and spirited man.
The sedition in this case consisted in advo-
cating reform of the Constitution, and the
arguments used by reformers of his day
appear to have been pretty closely in a
parity with those of Hyndman and the
modern Socialists. For instance, Mr.
Gerald, another Scottish victim, in defend-
ing himself, said that all great men had been
reformers, “ even our Saviour himself.”
The Judge who presided was, of course, like
almost all men who have flown or crawled
to a position of advantage, a strong Tory—
that is to say, a strong advocate for holding
on to the advantage he, with others, had
gained. The prisoner’s plea merely excited
his Lordship’s derision. “ Muckle he made
o’ thaat,” chuckled Lord JBraeield on the
Bench, when the reference to Christ, the
JACOB GARRARD, M.L.A.
(Photo. by Freeman.)
Reformer, was made. “Muekle he made
o’ thaat: He was hangit!”
a
At the pressnt day every aspirant for pro-
gressive reform is libelled as a Socialist.
This is merely a repetition of history. The
cant term earlier in the century was
“Jacobin.” Cockburn remarks, with re-
ference to the first years of the century,
that—
“Jacobinism was a term denoting everything
alarming and hateful, and every political objector
wasa Jacobin. No innovation, whether practical
or speculative, consequently no political or eco-
nomical reformer, and no religions dissenter, could
escape from this fatal word.”
One has only to be a regular reader of the
Colonial Tory newspapers—say, for instance,
the Sydney Morning Herald— to recognise
how exactly this disposition to traduce is
reproduced to-day, substituting the term
“ Socialist ” in lieu of “Jacobin.” Sydney
Smith bore testimony identical with that of
Cockburn. According to the former—
“lt is always considered a piece of impertinence
in England if a man of less than two or three thou-
sand a year has any opinions at all on important
subjects ; and, in addition, he was sure to be
assailed with all the Billingsgate of the French
Re volution-Jacobin, leveller, Atheist, Socinian,
incendiary, regicide, were the gentlest appellations
used; and any man who breathed a syllable
against the senseless bigotry of the two Georges,
or hinged at the abominable tyranny and persecu-
tion exercised against Catnolic Ireland, was
shunned as unfit for the relations of social life.”
Tricky Tories to-day are fond of enlarging
upon the perfection of civil and religious
liberty, which people in British communi-
ties are alleged to enjoy ; and a credulous
multitude are ever ready to applaud the
picture. Fiction it really is. There is, for
example, the supposed “right” of public
meeting. Why, it is only the other day that
in New South Wales, a professedly Liberal
Ministry allowed to be issued regula-
tions for the Sydney Domain, which effec-
tively placed all public meetings in that—the
only available open space—under a censor-
ship so absolute that in the metropolis of
one colony the “right” of public meeting
is at the present moment practically sus-
pended, and only permitted on sufferance.
This is merely in accordance with all prece-
dent. There is actually no right of either
public meeting or of untrammelled speech
inherent in British citizenship. Cockburn
tells that in Scotland there was in his earlier
days,
“No free, and, cinsequently, no discussing
Press.”
As to public meetings the same narrator
alleges
* 1 doubt If there was one during the 35 years
that succeeded the year 1795” (the year of the
French Revolution). “ Nothing was viewed with
such horror, as any political gathering not friendly
to existing institutions. No one could have taken
part In the business without making up his mind
to be a doomed man. No prudence could protect
against the falsehood or inaccuracy of spies, and
a first conviction for sedition by a judge-picked
jury was followed by 14 years’ transportation.”
Macaulay is equally emphatic and explicit
in the same theme. Pitt, he states—
“ Put down English Jacobinism with the strong
hand. The Habeas Corpus Act was repeatedly
suspended. Public meetings were placed under
severe restraints. . . . Writers who pro-
pounded doctrines adverse to monarchy and
aristocracy were proscribed and punished without
mercy. It was hardly safe for a Republican to
avow his creed over a beefsteak and his bottle of
port at a chophouse. The old laws of Scotland
against sedition- laws which were considered by
Englishmen as barbarous, and which a succession
of Governments bad suffered to rust, werej now
furbished up and sharpened anew. Men of cul-
tivated minds and polished manners wore, for
offences which at Westmeath would have been
treated as mere misdemeanours, sent to herd
with felons at Botany Bay. Some reformers
whose opinions were extravagant and whose
language was intemperate, but who had never
dreamed of subverting the Government by phy-
sical force, were indicted for high treason and
were saved from the gallows only by the righteous
verdicts of j uries. This severity wss at the time
loudly applauded by alarmists, whom fear had
made cruel, but will be seen in a very different
light by posterity.”
• e ■
Macaulay’s reliance upon the verdict of
posterity is to some extent unfortunate.
While nearly all agree in condemning the
particular abuses of power of those days,
there is, and has been, an extraordinary
alacrity in applying a close imitation of the
very same methods to modern times. For
example, as recently as the year 1848, in the
present reign, when the Chartist agitation
was at its height, all the old methods of
Pitt’s tyranny were resorted to with alac-
rity. Mr. J. Sketohlet, a veteran Chartist
still alive and now a member of the English
Social Democratic League, writts of those
days :
“The Government, while recognising the re-
public in France, prepared for the work of
slaughter ta prevent a republic at home. The
moat tyrannical measures were adopted, and the
provinces again filled with spies—those dirty tools
of every execrable despotism. The infamous
Crown and Government Protection Bill was has-
tily passed, making the advocacy of republicanism
an act of felony. Not content with k this, they
brought to the front an old and obsolete Act for
the suppression of all open-air meetings.”
But it may be still insisted that these eon*
ditions are past Jand gone, and that no
British Government would resort nowa-
days to such unconstitutional expedients.
Persons who argue thus are either inte-
rested liars or dwellers in a fool’s paradise
It is only requisite to refer to the treatment
of the Irish people during the past five
years to demonstrate that all the bad old
modes are as live as ever. What Pitt had
done in 1800, and the Cabinet of Lord John
Russell emulated in 1848, the Administra-
tion of Mr. Gladstone repeated in 1884-5.
And now, in 1836, we have the old system of
State prosecutions for sedition revived, and
a distinct disposition to resort to the old
methods for preventing free speech and
public open a’r meetings. These things
are worthy to be pondered over, and persons
who imagine that “ Britons never shall be
slaves” would do well to study history, and
investigate seriously wh*t protection for
political heresy—and 'all predelicticns for
reform are necessarily heresy—the.;iaws at
present subsisting really afford,

Berry as a Tory.
Mb. Gbaham Berry, lecturing on politics in
Melbourne, the other (fay, declared that it was
disgraceful that the three and ahalf millions
people of Australia, as prosperous as any in Her
Majesty's dominions, or perhaps more so, should
suffer the poor hard-working people of Great
Britain to pay taxes for the defence of Australia
against Itussia, or any other power. If people
here wanted responsibility and power they must
pay for it, and he prepared to defend themselves
from any possible invasion, which, if federated,
the would be able to do. Mr. Bbbby starts with a
fundamental error. His premises are vicious. It
would be disgraceful that the wealthy people of
Australia should suffer the poor hard-working
people of Great Britain to pay for the defence of
Australia against enemies provoked by Aus-
tralians. But, as a matter of fact, the case is en-
tirely different. The people of Australia have no
hereditary foes from whoso animosity they might
apprehend injury in the way of invasion or attack.
It is absolutely just that the people of Great
Britain should bear the cost of defending Austra-
lians from invasions or other injury consequent
on quarrels with which the people of Australia
have nothing to do. The entire argument of Mr.
Bbbby is, in reality, radically unsound, and pro-
ceeding from so shrewd a reasoner, the perverse-
ness of the plea can only be ascribed to the desire
of Mr. Berry to make smooth his ways in
anticipation of his approaching appearance in
London. It is a shame, truly, that the poor hard-
working people of Great Britain should have to
bear the burden of heavy expenditure for military
and naval establishments, which these very people
dislike and deprecate. But it is not the Australian
people who are responsible in this matter. It is
the monarchical, aristocratic, and oligarchical
castes in the old country. In whose interest alone
existing burdens have been created, and existing
armaments have been rendered necessary. It is a
fact too little known that nearly every pound
sterling of the National debt of Great Britain has
been incurred in wars, undertaken either to
gratify the hereditary ambitions and animosities of
the House of Hanover, or in efforts to suppress
the spirit of freedom and democracy in some part
of the globe. The National debt originated in
loans raised to enable William of Orange to
carry on his ol 1 warfare as statholder of the Butch
against the French, It was augmented by the
campaigns of Marlborough—campaigns in which
the poor hard-working people of Great Britain
had no more interest than had the Chinese.
It was further swelled to maintain the
Hanoverian Georges in their hereditary do-
minions on the Continent. It was enor-
mously inflated by the obstinate determination
of crazy George 111. to crush the English colo-
nists in North America, when these rose to resist
gross and arbitrary exactions. It was nearly
doubled by similar efforts to strangle the birth of
democratic and republican freedom in France,
and in a reckless war thrust upon the first Napo-
leon, whose empire was resented as an invasion
of the hes editary principle of monarchy. And in
recent times it has been augmented afresh by ex-
peditions to punish savages, as in the Abyssinian
and Ashantee wars, and to quench national rights,
as in the instances of the Boer and Egypto-Soudan
campaigns. In none of these had the poor hard-
working people of Great Britain any interest,
unless it be granted that their interest w' s identi-
cal with the cause of national liberties, and con-
sequently in direct antagonism to the objects
of wars into which they were dragged and seduced
by the wealthy orders. Mr. Graham Berry used
to pretend that he held Liberal principles. Did he
still care to maintain that farce, the proper moral
for him to inculcate would be that the free people
of Australia should make, to the best of their op-
portunities, common cause with the poor hard-
working people of Great Britain in their efforts to
shift the burden of taxation on to the shoulders of
the privileged classes which created the load, and
constantly refuses to sustain it.

Twin Geniuses.
The licensed victuallers of Sydney are to be con-
gratulated upon securing the services of Mr,
D alley as spokesman and apologist at their last
annual picnic. There is no person in the colony
who could more efficiently discharge the func-
tions which had to be fulfilled upon that occasion.
Even Mr. Daniel O’Connor must be regarded as
in some respects inferior to Mr. Dalley as an
after-dinner panegyrist. Mr. O’Connor s delivery
is more fervid, and he slaps on his enconiums with
a superior emphasis it may be. There is a breadth
of treatment in his manner of slobbering, which
is almost unapproachable. But it must be con-
fessed that in Mr. Dalley’s method there is a de-
licacy-a sort of light and shade—which is lacking
in Mr. O’Connor's style. As a professional flat-
terer Mr. O’Connor tears the passion to tatters.
Not only are all his geese swans, but they are
swans in the superlative. He is not content with
ascribing to the clacking flock which he under-
takes to glorify, the most snowy of plumage
and the extremest curvature of neck, but car-
ried away by the ecstacy of his admiration
he would not hesitate to outrage the unities by
celebrating in glowing periods the exquisite beauty
of voice possessed by the objects of his adulation.
Now, Mr. Dalley does not blunder in his detail.
His touches are light and airy. He may paint
geese as swans, but once the initial sacrifice of the
Yerities.has been made, he maintains a creditable
consistency, and the imaginary bird he describes is
a real swan—a specimen of the noblest description,
Indeed, but always with the natural attributes.
Upon the whole, therefore, we repeat that the
licensed victuallers are to be congratulated.
There are, we believe, only two public men of any
notoriety who could be procured to undertake
with the requisite abandon and effrontery, to
deliver an eulogium upon the profession of greg-
selllng. These are Messrs. O’Connor and Dalley,
Of the two, Mr. Dalley is distinctly the superior
practitioner. Perhaps, however, it was more to
chance than to appreciation that the licensed vic-
tuallers owe their good fortune on this occasion-
Mr. O’Connor has, of late, to a certain extent re-
tired from this line of business. He seemed to have
surpassed himself, and attained the meridian of
panegyristic achievement when, on acquiring the
status of a Minister of the Crown, his efforts cul-
minated in the delivery of an impassioned eulo-
gium upon himself. This supreme achievement
appears to have exhausted Mr. O’Connob, at least
temporarily, as he has not since been heard to
splutter, save when in the Legislative Assembly
foe invited the House to a review of ancient his-
tory, and was prematurely extinguished by a gust
of opprobrious laughter. Mr, Dalley, conse-
quently, has the Held to himself, and may be ex-
pected to reign without compeer as the champion
professional spouter of the expiring picnic season.
Happy the community which is secure of so gor-
geous an alternation of talent! When it is denied
the fluent gushings of its O’Connob, it is blessed
with the liquid inconsequences of its D alley.
Brethren in method, though rivals in renown,
Mr. Justice
Fbom one point of view the breakdown of the
Jennings-Robebtson Ministry is one of the most
laughable political events conceivable. Lord
Caeington is waiting, the clerk is in attendance,
most of the Ministry are present, and at the last
moment it is announced that there will be no per-
formance. What more farcical situation could
there be ? The only wonder is how His Excellency
could keep his countenance. But when we come
to the cause of the fiasco, the matter is a more
serious one. Two honourable and learned gentle-
men indulging in a most undignified scramble for
one particular office—that of Attorney-General of
New South Wales—not that that post is, either for
its inherent dignity or for its accompanying
emoluments, so much more desirable than any
other in the Cabinet—oh dear, no I—but because
unless rumour is in a more than usually men-
dacious mood, there is a chance of an almost im-
mediate vacancy on the Supreme Court Bench ;
and because, by a most vicious usage, the
Attorney-General for the time being has a first
mortgage on the appointment. Now, the modest
salary of ministerial office, coupled with, in a
weak Ministry, its very precarious tenure, is a
poor thing compared with £3,500 for life,or a good
pension at the end of a few years’ service.
Easy work, combined with an exalted dignity, that
is a proposition evident to the very meanest
capacity, even to Ministerial Intelligence. Hence
the row. What, then, are the claims of the rival
aspirants for office ? One is, indeed, an advocate
of undoubted powers, yet hardly fitted either by
age or dignity of manner for the judicial office—at
all events, as yet. The other, a pompous person-
age, whose unimpeachable elegance of attire and
exquisitely-fitting gloves form one of the principal
attractions of George-street, Sydney, any fine
afternoon between four and five o’clock, and who
also, we believe, for a short time adorned with his
portly presence the District Court Bench of the
colony. The political distinctions of both gentle-
men are, however, great, and approximately
equal. One has been in the Assembly for about
four months, most of which time has been wasted
by one would-be Premier after another attempting
to form a Ministry; the other has for a consider-
ably shorter period served his bleeding country in
that Upper House, which he has discovered to be
(since his own elevation to it) the most distin-
guished, the most useful, and the most intelli-
gent Upper Chamber in Australasia. Finally,
each gentleman has filled the exalted office
now forming the bone of contention for a period
of something under two months, during which
in each case nothing but ordinary routine work
has been done. Why, when recently in Victoria,
a gentleman, known for years as an active politi-
cian, who had served in several Administrations
(and a Victorian Administration generally lasts
longer than the three months which now seems to
be the rule in the city of the Beautiful Harbour),
and who had had wide experience in that making
of laws which is perhaps a more arduous task
than the interpretation of them—when this gen-
tleman was raised to the Bench there all parties,
all divisions of the Press united in denouncing it
as a gross political job. What would they say of
that which seems to have been contemplated in
Sydney ? What we say is that such an appointment
would be a political job beside which that of Mr.
Justice Kebeeed would sink into absolute insig-
nificance.
-
A Colonial Peerage.
Considering that from time immemorial mon-
archs have staked their very existence, and poured
out like water the blood of their subjects, to steal
or retain a province, the anxiety of the aristo
cratle faction in Great Britain to promote Imperial
Federation as contrasted with the indifference of
the English Liberals and their occasional prompt-
ings to the Australian colonies to set up for them-
selves, is quite comprehensible. It was a Liberal
Administration which withdrew Imperial troops
from Australasia. It is an aristocratic idea to
supply the place of troops with a body of Colonial
Peers. Next to an army of occupation, an in-
fluential corps of traitors is the most useful force
to maintain in a community which it is designed
to keep in a position of dependence. Lord Rose-
beby, who professes to be that impossible crea-
ture, a Radical Peer, 1s credited with being the
originator of the idea of .instituting a Colonial
Peerage. But as it was subsequent to his visit to
these colonies that the conception was made, it
seems probable that it had its origin among our
own snobocracy. Australians will, we trust, never
submit to be Insulted by the alleged distinction of
a few individuals. They have had warnings suf-
ficient in the choice which has been made for the
minor “ distinctions ” heretofore allotted to colo-
nists. They have seen the meanest creatures
among the colonists selected for royal honour.
They have, moreover, the warnings of history as
applied to existing British peerages—a narrative
which shows that peerages have in a majority of
cases been the rewards of female prostitution or ,
male debasement.
—
His Priend and His Country
Sib Jo n Robertson's reason for abandoning Sir
Patrick Jennings when the attempt to form a
Coalition Government was comparatively a
settled thing, throws a lurid light upon the prin-
ciples which govern the former Knight in his
political relations. His conception of loyalty is
directly antagonistic to the ideas which have been
endorsed and applauded foy tho universal consent,,
of mankind for 2000 years. Sir John, with a fine
Independence, repudiates the systems of Spartan
virtue and of Roman public spirit. With him the
State may count tor a good deal, but a friend
counts for more. He prefers loyalty to a friend,
over devotion to his country. The sacrifice by
Brutus of the life of his own son to the public
weal must appear to Sir John to have been an
unmanly and unnatural desertion and betrayal of
a primary duty. The Coalition was to rescue the
colony from grievous and Imminent disasters. It
was practically arranged. The country was as
good as saved, according to the idea of Sir John.
But a political hanger-on, in the person of G. B.
Simpson, interposed his claims to office. If
the arrangement were clinched, he (Simpson)
would regard himself as sacrificed. Bbutus
would not have hesitated for an instant. The
whine of the friend would have quickly been
changed into the shrieks of the sacrificed. And
Sir John also did not 1 esitate an instant. To save
the country and abandon a retainer, or to stick to
the retainer and let the country go to destruction,
were the alternatives before him. Sir John in-
stantly elected to prefer his dependent to his
country, and with amazing effrontery calls upon
gods and men to admire his virtue. Anything
more iamentahie we do not remember in the
whole history of modern politics. Such things
have been done repeatedly. But the chief actor
has always had the sense to recognise, and the
decency to hide, his shame. Sir John Is the only
public man known to our observation or reading
who has dared to maintain that to sacrifice one’s
duty to the State in deference to one’s obligations
to a follower is an instance of virtue deserving of
applause.
■——
A Cabinet of Contradictions.
Political jealousy, not less absurd and contempt-
ble in its operation than disastrous in Its effects,
has brought a New South Wales Ministry into
existence under the nominal leadership of Sir
Patbiok Jennings. Individually it is a stronger
Cabinet than that of Sir John Robertson; col-
lectively, it is—if such a thing be possible—weaker.
It is a Coalition Cabinet in that members of en-
tirely opposite views and opinions on cardinal
points are included, but it has not that strength
which abandonment by parties of principle and
mutual condonation of abuse and condemnation
is usually able to secure. The disgrace of a Coali-
tion has been undergone without the attainment
of compensating force. With regard to matters
financial it is worse than feeble. Sir Patrick has
yet to earn reputation as a Treasurer, and he will
be assailed by the conflicting opinions of his col-
leagues— Dibbs, Garvan, and Copeland. The two
former are the most inveterate foes in the
Assembly. Mr, Garvan’s best speeches have
been his incisive and bitter denunciations of Mr.
Dibbs and what the latter was pleased to call his
“policy.” Twice has a Ministry in which the
png member for Murrumbidgee was a pro-
minent figure, been overthrown by the pitilessly
keen logic of the member for Eden, and now
behold Goliah of Gath, the financial Philis-
tine, and David, his political destroyer, are
to fight under the same standard! To do so
one or other mfist fcompl.tely abandon ail pre-
vious opinions and habits. The lion must lie
down with the lamb. Mr. Dibbs has made light of
the deficiency, possibly because it is the off-
spring of his own Administration, and airily pro-
poses to fly a Treasury kite so as to postpone
the evil day. Mr. Garvan has committed him-
self to the opinion that the whole amount must
be cleared off in one year. If the Dibbs “ policy”
guides the Cabinet, Mr. Garvan s former con-
demnation will recoil upon his own head; if on
the contrary the Garvan proposals are adopted,
Mr. Dibbs, by giving his consent, will be a party
to a vote of censure on himself. Mr. Garvan’s
inclusion in the team was a risky experiment, but
the allotment of a portfolio to Mr. Dibbs was a
fatal blunder. The latter created the deficit,
denied its magnitude and even existence during
the g'eneral election, and now stands charged
by Mr. Burns, the Robertson Treasurer, not
only with the grossest political negligence, but
also with “ transferring to the loan account
charges which clearly should he made against
consolidated;” accusations which have not been
refuted or even, denied. It Is useless to urge
that these things should be no bar-Mr.
Dibbs is not Treasurer. His very presence
will discredit the Ministry from Twofold Bay
to the Tweed, for critics are more implacable out
of the House than in it. And of Mr. Garvan It
may be said that unless he now refuses consent to
the continuance of those abuses which he has so
ruthlessly condemned, Ms political character
will suffer for every day of his adhesion
to the party permitting these abuses. It will
be of interest to notice his conduct with re-
gard to the “cooking” of railway and tramway
accounts, which, in the previous Parliament, he so
plainly proved. Will he now he a party to this
“cooking?” Nor can Mr. Want’s inclusion be
now considered a wise step, in view of the fact
that it is only a fortnight since he proved that
personal dignity was dearer to him than political
expediency. It seems impossible that this Cabinet
of contradictions can last for any length of time.
Nor is it to be desired that it should do so, for its
members being particles possessed of mutual re-
pulsion, can only be made to cohere by an over-
powering desire for Place, Pay, and Power. In
their fervid anxiety to exclude Sir Henry Parkes
from office, the leaders of the Coalition have
simply played into his hands. A proportion of
electors may justifiably, and, indeed do, distrust
Sir Henry, but this Cabinet will bo regarded with
still greater distrust and aversion, and while Sir
Henry is known to be a man of capacity, it is

An indignant correspondent, writing to the Syd-

the fact of his having passed the Treason Felony
Act, in consequence of which Irishmen could not
obtain employment in the colony. This corres-
pondent is not correct in his deduction. He has
mistaken the cause and effect. Irishmen were
hated, and feared exceedingly by the bigots of
those days, and this distrust and hatred produe a

When, a month or two ago, “ Jack ” Want
took office as Attorney-General of the Robertson-
O'Connor Government, ke provided himself, at a
cost of £3O, with the orthodox Attorney-General’s
gown, and when, in the words of the conventional
draper’s advt, “inconsequence of having to leave
the premises” he “sold off,” he disposed of hia
gown of office to Mr. G. B. Simpson; tne incoming
Attorney-General, for a consideration of £lO, con-

that all is confiscated by English law; because,

by taxing his efforts (charging rent on his 1m-

on the very brink Of starvation. All the ire of
English politicians and journalists seem to be only
for those wh© retaliate, and for Mr. Parnell,
because he does not, like themselves, keep howling
into the deaf ears of a suffering people to keep
still, but rather elects to make them so, and to
put an end to outrages by the very efficacious
means of removing their cause. That notoriously
infamous man, James Carey (who hated the move-
ment under Mr. Parnell, and tried to ruin it in the
sight of the world, seizing his first opportunity, as
Queen’s witness, to state that he believed the
funds, which supplied the Invincibles with sinews
of war, came from the Land League organisation),
admitted on cross-examination that Brady and
others could not see the necessity of joining his
‘ society ’ until open agitation was put a stop to by
Mr. Forster. Very well. The Sydney Daily Tele-
graph, with reference to the late London riots,
has pointed out very clearly that, ‘ln the eyes of
justice, it is not those who strike the blow are
reprehensible, but rather he or those who caused
its necessity.’ One of England’s greatest Consti-
tutional writers, the D T. says, It was who laid
down this sweeping dictum. So that, according
to ‘England s greatest constitutional writer,’ it Is
Mr. Forster, and not the ignorant, brutal Joe
Brady,who ought to have been tried tor the Phoenix
Park murders. But taking outrages of the same
magnitude In Ireland as, say, those committed
lately In the London streets, compare how the
comments run in each case from the.pens of such
editors as of the S.M. Herald, Daily Telegraph,
News, &o„ and it will be seen that, Instead of ex-
planations and half-hearted condemnations, there
are wholesale exaggerations and demands for the
most stringent forms of coercion. And so it is
with the Press in England (from which block I dare
say the Sydney chips have sprung). The howl for
coercion is put down by a willing Legislature
granting all that is asked for. Thus fuel is added
to the fire of discontent in Ireland. Meetings are
suppressed ; in other words, the safety-valves are
hermetically sealed. Mr. Forster and the Press are
jubilant, when, lo I a terrible explosion takes
place in the Phoenix Park. Then there is a yell for
coercion. The hangman is busy for a time, and
English rule in Ireland starts again at zero to go
over the same old circle of failure. All this time
one man has been zealously working to remove the
cause of poverty, disloyalty, and crime, and history
will yet record that Mr. Parnell was the harbinger
of peace between England and Ireland, and that
his work was greatly impeded by the reptile English
Press. Permit me, before concluding, to say a word
re Irish Loyalty The Sydney D.T. accused Dr.
O'Doherty, M.L.C., of Brisbane, of duplicity be-
cause he ‘speaks something much milder, much more
constitutional, and more loyal in Australia than in
Ireland.’ Admitting what the D.T. evidently
wished to convey, without telling a direct lie, viz ;
that Dr. O'Doherty makes disloyal speeches in
Ireland, and loyal speeches in Australia, what
does it prove ? I think it is an instance of a rebel
becoming loyal on ‘touching the sacred soil of
freedom.’ It proves, however, that the Irish
people do not want any parleys about loyalty,
and as one who has lately corns from
amongst them, I can assure you such Is the
case. Of course, the Queen Is respected by
the Irish, just as other women are who respect
themselves-especially those old ladies who have
endeavoured to bring up large families In th«

has said (and he is not remarkable for extravagant
language) that, if the Irish people had Home Rule*
‘ they would not be more disloyal than they are at
present.’ Cardinal Moran says that they will be-
come loyal and strengthen the Crown—l suppose
in its wars—to wit; the bloody Soudan fiasco. He
also told us, on his late arrival from Ireland, that
Mr. Parnell is ‘ loyal to the Crown.’ The utter-
ances of Doctor Croke, or Doctor Nulty may be
worthy of notice on the subject; but I would
rather take his Eminence as an authority on low
bodies at a dance v. tights at a trapeze—which
produces the worse results—than on a question of

The high-handed style in which Victorians

and bled against his Queen in the brave davs of
old, is said to have sternly refused to “ rise Sir

which animates these gentlemen. At any rate,
they are proof against the paltry temptation of a

reluctantly say farewell, and I can assure them the

When Graham Berry (who, on the prin-

hymns and hallelujahs to the ex-Victorian Pre-

was meant for him, assumed the holiest look that
ever adorned the visage of any human being.

such an ovation could be identical with the
perky and giddy gentleman of 03, who, as with

Some years ago, while her husband was in
gaol for sheep-stealing, Mrs. Wilkie, the attractive
wife of a Dubbo grazier, struck up a liaison with
•Mr. John Oxley Norton, the local police magis-
trate. She became jealous of her lover, whom
she interviewed with a loaded pistol, and shot
right through the brain. To the astonishment of
the surgeons, the victim lived on and was
conscious for weeks, but one day he suddenly fell
back dead. Mrs. Wilkie was tried for murder, but
being a'pretty woman’it was concluded that she
had committed manslaughter only, and so she
escaped with two or three years’ gaol, part of
which term she spent in Darlinghurst, where she
fascinated and bore a child to a son of one of the
prison officials. Last week, in Sydney, Wilkie
divorced the irrepressible masher, his wife.
Here is something new in the obituary
line. We quote it from the Melbourne Age :
“ He longed to drink the spiced wine,
Within Jerusalem new;
Himself to it he did resign.
And bade the world adieu.”
This sentiment is both candid and cheerful. We
like it much better than the usual talk about
leaving friends in tears and going to the cold and
silent tomb, and such like lugubrious stuff. The
idea of this gamesome ghost resigning himself to
the spiced wine “in Jerusalem new” leaves
nothing to be desired on the score of humour. If
all who go to the new Jerusalem are like him, it is
high time they had a Blue Ribbon movement up
there.
Sporting men will be shocked to hear that

It has often been a puzzle to us to fix the
nationality of that eminent advocate and would-

witcb) seldom smoked a cigarette or projected an
Indiad invasion without consulting him, and from
this we had taken him for a Russian. We have
fogged out the history of the great Italian house
of Colonna, but cannot And where the Close closed
in with them. We, therefore, concluded he was
not an Italian emissary for the Pope. But next he
speaks French, and you think you can trace the
courtly ways of the Empire, or that he is a Bour-
bon prince—or he tackles you with so true a Ger-
man accent, and has such a military - bearing that
he might have been aide-de-camp to Von!Moltke, or

Prince Bismarck has received from the
Pope the Order of Christ. This, of course, was
because the Chancellor flattered his Holiness by
referring the affair of the Carolines to his arbitra-
tion. Not long since, if he had wanted to present
Bismarck with any Order it would have been the
Order of Judas—even if he had to create such an
Crder especially for Bismarck’s benefit. But even
Infallibility can sail with the tide and change with
the times. The curious and significant part of the
affair is that, according to the statutes of the
Order of Christ, a declaration of faith is necessary
on the part of the recipient. As, however, it
would be the foolishest kind of folly to expect
this from Bismarck the Pope has granted him a
dispensation from the ceremony. How the man

clearly—which is that, rigid and unalterable as she
seems, the Church of Rome is the most elastic of

might canonise even John Davies —such as if he

with the Black Chapter thrown in, down the har-
bour in steamers and drowned them.

very much less self-abasement than it has mani-
fested times out of number when in contact with
titled crawlers of all sorts, whose only recom-
mendation was that they, like the rest of mankind,
had fathers.
An old shepherd named Moses Dodds died
in the Orange (N.S.W.) hosnita'. He had been on
the station for 40 years, and was notorious for his
miserly habits, not allowing himself the neces-
saries of life and dressing In rags. He had a
paralytic stroke and died intestate. He left £l6OO.
Let us make the old man a present of a tomb-
stone:—
Stranger attend, Beneath these clods
Repose the bones of Moses Dodds.
In life his coat was full of holes,
And patched all over were his moles.
All p'easures Moses Dodds ignored,
And ration-mutton was his board.
He never ventured neir a town,
And never one > had been lambed down.
To screw and save was all his aim.
And for full forty years this game
He followed till there came a bill,
All men must pay whate’er their will.
Death handed in his small account,
And Moses sobbed, “ Whatl the amount ?
I’ve only sixteen hundred pound.
But in ten years more I’ll be bound
I'll double that. If you’ll but wait
Then you ern come, or soon or late
You’ll find that I'll be up to dhte;
And square without a groan the bill;
Just give me ten years. Say you wili.”
“.Cash down,” said Death; “ now come on, Mo,
My answer straight to you is ‘ No.’ ”
You’ve neither chick nor child nor wife,
You’d swindle me as you have Life,
You’ve tended your last flock of sheep.
Pay now or ten years hence, what odds ?
Here’s my receipt: “ Here lies Mo. Dodds.”
Bret Harte is beginning to fall rapidly
into the sere and yellow leaf. This is what is said
bf him by one who hat seen him lately:-” People
#ho knbw him he went abroad a
slender; graceful, dark-hailed; elegant man, would
scarcely recall his former lineaments In the grey,
wrinkled, Corpulent person he has become. His
hair is now as white as snow; he is of full habit,
with a decided tendency to embonpoint, and has
lost the graceful elegance that once rendered him
so fascinating. One of his sons, Francis B. Harte,
named for his father, is an actof of great promise,
and has taken Dion Boficlbault’s place in the rhost
famous Irish parts with success.. The other, and
elder, is in business, and prefers iis
Sure of success to the precarious ways of
literature and the drama. Bret, having lost his
consular position, his future is a serious question,
as he has saved very little, is naturally extrava-
gant, and the blush and bloom of the reputation
that made him master of the situation a dozen
years ago, have been dulled and tarnished by
commonplace later work, produced for what it
would bring with the two maeic syllablts of Bret
Harte affixed to it.” We told in this paper some
time ago how he lost his consular position. The
fact is he was too big for his consular boots. But
he can still make his salt, and, we daresay, even
pepper occasionally, by his pen. There are many
quite as deserving people worse off than Bret
Harte. Not to put too fine a point unon it, the
writer of this paragraph has frequently got up in
the morning without knowing clearly where he
wohld get his little bottle of champagne with 13
iu op £2 f absinthe in it. But it is curious to note
tne difference between the commercial instincts of
Bret Harte and Mark Twain. The former has
nothing now but his pen to depend upon. The
latter is partner in a great printing-house, and a
vr an l. Parted Poor-in fact, of the
than W ? IQ b ,x d Rss chances in the beginning
than Bret Harte. He hsd more than his shrewd-
ness, however, and this made the difference.

it eventuated on Thursday, 21th inst., at
the Sir J oseph Banks’ grounds at Botany Bay. Sir
Joseph was unavoidably absent, but the Hop. D.
O Connor, late Postmaster-General, was there, and
so were we. We were whirled out there by
tram at the rate of fully two miles an hour. It was
an exciting ride. Every minute or so the con-

pavilion. Seven hundred licensed victuallers had
already taken their seats, and the clash of steel J
and clink of glasses announced the battle had i
begun. It was a desperate struggle. The gentle
goose and long-necked turkey, the less pretentious
hen, and the wallowing swine, a'l went down
before the fell invader. The tickets to toe

What is Socialism?
wero last week obliged to break off
. inquiry while it was still incomplete. We had
. som e outline of the antiquity of the ques-
£ !V definition of its raison d’etre, and a digest of
tion ’ t w o of its essential contentions. Thus we
oD ® exp iained that the complaint of Socialists is
fh t modern society is an organised anarchy which
t “ a ts i n antagonism to natural justice, and is
w ° characterised by a systematised “robbery
f the poor.” We had digested the arguments by
° hich Socialists seek to demonstrate that private
w ership of land is pernicious, and further, that
°iha existing relations between Capital and Labour
1 e oppressive and mischievous. We will now
ar idly review the ground covered so far, and
then proceed. Personal property is defined by
Socialists as that which is proper to a man-all the
wers of body and mind which by nature are his.
rommoa property is explained to be certain
° aterial things which are essential for the main-
mnance and renewing of personal property-in
other words, of a man's powers, bodily and mental;
a short, of his healthy life, Further, we have
1 oted the deduction that by exertion a man can
create or develope exchange able values. That is to
„ *hnt bv labour—the exercise of his powers,
mental or physical— applied to certain material
things which are “ common property, ’ he can pro-
s, of commodities fit for use. We nave seen also
that hdnest exchange signifies the exchange of
one commodity whicn has cost a certain amount of
?ahour to produce for any other commodity which
pmbodies the exertion of an equal amount of
fahour And, finally, we have noted how,
introduction of machinery, one man may
EfnnoDOlise to himself the occupation and
So labour rewards of many, and while accumu
substance beyond his necessities, leave
those others deprived of returns adequate to
maintain themselves, and ultimately compel them
tn accept, as his hired slaves, less than the full
value of their labour, and thus artificially replace
vfineral comfort of a modest kind with wretched-
npss and all its consequences of discontent, envy,
mime, and the expensive machinery for the con-
trol (repression being impossible) of these evils.
We are reviewing, it must be remembered,
the theories of English Socialists. -They say that
the existing social system revolves la a vicious
circle. The capitalist robs the poor of the value
nt his labour. But he is not permitted to keep
the snoils to himself. He is comparatively a
» little flea,” and has “ bigger fleas to bite him.
The land owner squeezes the capitalists, and makes
the latter disgorge, in the form of rent, a large
nroporlion of the plunder, which the land»owner
then proceeds to squander, robber-like, in personal
gratifications and selfish indulgence. But here we
must interpose a word for the land owner and the
capitalist not in business. It would be absurd to
nretecd that there is more than an economic re-
semblance between robbers and plunderers and the
propertied classes. It is notoriously true tnat re-
finement and delicacy follow to a great length the
drift of riches. It is notoriously true that among
the propertied and moneyed classes in Great
Britain and elsewhere are as large a proportion—
perhaps a larger proportion—of upright, honour-
able, pure-minded, and tender-soufed persons
as there are among people ol any race
and in any other condition of life. There
are among them individuals who would dis-
tribute their whole substance m charity,
did they believe it would do any good. But
it is only recently that the Socialist system
has been presented in a coherent and mteingiDie
form, and up to the present time an economic
gospel has been taught—and that by perspns
clearly above suspicion of partiality, or of being
unduly well-affectloned in the propertied and
capitalist classes—the sum of which is that indis-
criminate or wholesale charity or partition w cnla
rather intensify than relieve the sufferings of the
poor, on the whole. This is the Malthusian system,
which even Mill, radical thinker as he was,
bowed before. The wealthy classes, therefore,
can distinguish no obligation or duty, and
they are slow to acknowledge the cogency
if cogency there be—of the arguments pro-
pounded by the Socialistic school now rising.
There is not, we believe, at the present day, one
very wealthy declared convert to Socialism. The
very poor, on the other hand, don’t understand
ihe philosophy, although they are ripe fur accept-
ance of the broad conception that they should
share in the general wealtn of the nation. Ihe
apostles of Socialism in Great Britain are mostly
of the lower middle class, men whose intellects
ate developed and whose interests are almost
neuter. The rich can t be expected to hail the
new philosophy with eager cordiality. It is, doubt-
less, very pleasant to be rich and distinguished,
although, while the wretchedness produced by
want has no limit save a miserable death, the
pleasures afforded by wealth are not of propor-
tionate expant iveness. It is impossible, for in-
stance, to be utterly poverty-stricken, and yet
eisy-mlnded and quite happy; but it is quite
possible to be immensely rich, and yet utterly
wretched. It is very difficult, even for a candid-
minded man of discip'lned intellect, to appreciate
the force and verity of arguments which jar
equally against his preconceptions, his sentimental
ideas, his early training, and his religious im-
pressions, and the adoption of which would fur-
ther strip film of honourable affluence and grati-
fying distinctions. And among ihe wealthy, as
compared with the middle classes, elegance rather
than severity of mental traioicu, prevails. They
are not, as a clas?, trained to be close reasoaem,
uor to pride themselves upon dispassionate
unselfishness ot views. And besides, they
are taught from childhood and throughout
life, by a most reverend and respectable
order ot priests, that their happy cond'tiun is due
to the decrees ot Providence, and that to question
the justice of the inequalities of fortune which
Prevail Is to fly in the face of the Almighty, and
blaspheme His holy ordinances.
* * *
This brings us straight to another of the
authorities the Socialists quote for their system.
They d spute tor possession of the theological
ground; and while challenging the most reverend
and respt ctable - that is to say, the most highly paid
—piitsts, as peisonaily concerned to justify a
system by which they receive infinitely more
than the value ot their labour and talents,
t«e Caristlaa Socialist appeals direct to the
Bible. While the m jor.ty of the clergy con-
tinue to inculcate a divide sanction for monopoly
and so ingratiate themselves w.ta the classes
wfieh have the gifts of bishoprics am fat in-
comes, a little band, headid in too Eitablished
Cimrch by the Bev. Canon Shuttle worth, th . K . v.
bvuait Headlam, and Kev. C. W. rtubes, are
preaching the Socialism of Christ. And, away in
the North, Scotch ministers are allying tnem.ems
with the league lor the restoration of the land
to the people at large, and a tre-m solem i leaiue
and covenant Is being signed numerously by the
people of Scotland, while even in Australia the
most courageous ot the apostles of Henry George s
theories is the Kcv. W T. Carter of South Austra-
lia. By such as these the Christian Socialist is
written. Its motto is that
" w hile continuing the Christian spirit, upon
which the teachings ot Maurice and Kingsley were
based, we will not h isitate to advance the prln-
e plea of Socialism with all the significance which
has been to that term by the patient investi-
gation ot the last 35 years.”
♦ * *
These teachers, with nothing to hope in
the way of worfily, ecclesiastical or social advan-
tage, hut on the contrary, enter the field ot dlspu-
Jaiion, like the Covenanters ot old, Bible in hand-
Ihey appeal to the law of Mosts;/‘The land shall
tot he sold for ever; for ihe land is mite. \e are
mrangers and sojourners wi'h me.’—(Lev xxv.
"detseq.) And when they are told that the. old
dispensation has expired, they turn to the teach-
mgs of Christ, and quote afresh, with awful em-
phasis; “ Gi ve us this day our daily bread —a
petition obviously not framed for capitalists;
“Lay not up for yourselves treasures in earth;
and, again, “If thou wilt be perfect, go sell all
thou hast and give it to the poor;’’ and ‘lt is
easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a
needle than for a rich man to enter into the king-
dom of heaven-” And, still working this mine of
Social ethics, they allege the parable of Lazarus
and Dives, in which Christ depicted Dives going
to hell for no other apoarent vice other than that
he had suffered Liz irus to be in misery at his gates
andmadeuo effort to relieve him. How, they
argue, in London, Lazarus is always at the gate of
Dives—only it is at the hack gate: the policeman
would attend to him did he trouble at the front.
Atthabaokof Mayfair lies Horrible London. The
slums are within a stone’s throw of my Lord o con-
servatory in Belgravia.
« * *
Now for the remedy. As we understand
the writers whose conceptions we are reviewing,
the remedy which the Socialists propose for the
anarchy which afflicts humanity is Communism.
“ Common property,” that is to say the forces and
opportunities furnished by nature for the main-
tenance of life, they would recover from tne per-
sons who now monopolise any paft ox it, and they
would make it really common property. Thus,
land, water, light, air, would be all equally free
and accessible, and all would he worked and put
to use to the best possible advantage for the
general benefit. Secondly, the productive power
of machinery would be communised. The benefit
and the saving would not be divided between the
capitalist and the landowner—it would be Dis-
tributed among all. But here a potent objection
interposes. “ What I ,r cry the crltics f deprive
genius of its reward ? Take away the inducement
from inventors? The world would stand still.
Here we find the objection met, and, we think,
bravely and nobly met. Treating not merely of
the inventor, but of “the poet, the painter,
the prophet or reprover of falsehood and
baseness, the lawyer or obtainer of justice, the
physician, the statesman or governing man,
each and all of these live to benefit their fel-
lows, and by their fellows they must be main-
tained.” But “let this be clearly understood
i that, for every non-producer who is so sup-
ported, the producers are called upon tor
additional exertions, or else the common store
would he diminished, and this also that these
non-producers are not to he maintained at any
mice they may choose to estimate their ser-
vices at, but that all that the community can
do, or can he expected to do, is to guarantee their
“TROUBLE.”
Lady Carington has selected the word
“Trouble” for the Sketching Institute’s
motif this evening. Above - behind the
spikes—will be seen a picture of a gentleman
in trouble. By the way, the N.S.W. “Sketch-
ing Institute” appears to be a somewhat dense
body which can’t take a hint. When Lady
Carington, who has now plenty to do, was first
approached by the members and asked to
select a subject for them, her ladyship chose
“Repose,” of which at the time she was sorely
in need. Yet the Sketching Institute heeded
not, but next week came along for another
subject, whereupon their patroness, finding it
necessary to more plainly convey that the In-
stitute was a nuisance, chose “Trouble.” Next
week, we understand, Lady Carington will
select “Boredom” as a motif.
lives to them in as happy and noble condition as
the hardest worker or actual producer.”
Here we find a spirited passage:—
“ A pretty state of matters this would he, it Is
derisively cried- a nice incentive to discovery and
invention, that I ’ Nothlog is more characteristic
of this corrupt and Mammon-loving age than this,
that all great and noble work is deemed impossible
save through hope of money re ward. With all my
heart and soul I protest, and to my latest breath 1
shall continue to protest, against this foul and de-
graded conception of human nature. Hold this
belief if you will, but understand that to do so is
to deny all that is high and pure in man; to ignore
all that is noble and inspiring in history. Hold it it
you will, but recognise that you—whose only con-
ception is of man as a belag, the origin of whose
every effort lies in its rapacity and greed—have
left it to the despised Socialist to conceive of him
as one who may possibly be moved to high en-
d avour by asimple desire to serve his fellow-men;
left it to him to believe that Shakespeare wrote,
that Burns sang, and Carlyle taught—that Watt
smght to wrest from Nature the secret of the
power of steam, and Stephenson planned how best
to utilise it—from something other in them than
the lust of gain.”
* v a
Proceeding, however, with our investiga-
tion of the Socialistic proposals, we quote afresh
from Hyndman and Morris:
‘For reconstruction and reorganisation we
Socialists continually strive, looking to the com-
pletest physical, moral, and intellectual develop-
ment of every human being as the highest form
of the social state, as the best and truest happi-
ness for every individual and for every class,
where, as none need overwork, so none shall be
able to force others to work for their profit.”
Meeting here the sneer Utopian, these writers
contend that it may have been Utopian years ago,
but that the very causes which have deepened
social disorder have facilitated the remedy. The
tendency to work everything on a big scale, and
by companies or associations, prepares, they say,
the way for State control, or, in otter words, com-
munal operation of all departments of exchange
and so forth, They would have the railways
worked by the State; so also with shipping; so
with banking. They say the economical forms are
ready, and that the transfer could be arranged
almost without a hitch—which seems to us some-
what oversanguine. And the means of affecting
this social revolution ? Well, they are clear only
in one particular. Manhood suffrage to begin
with. Thus?—
“ To avoid alike the Crushing anarchy of to-day
and the fierce anarchy of to-morrow, we strive to
help forward the workers to the control of toe
State, as the only means whereby sficih! hi “ eo ß®
trouble (the reference is to the dynamite tendency
of the desperate of these days) and production and
exchange can be organised tor the benefit of tne
country at large. Thus, therefore, we propose
that all should have the vote ; not that the vote
will free them from economical oppression, but
because in this way alone is a peaceable'issue pos-
sible for the possessing classes. It is better (here
there is a gleam of teeth) * for ihem to yield to the
vote of organised opinion than to the victory of
even organised force.”
In fact the Socialists do not disguise that they
mean bilsiaesS with respect to compensation,
they eay:—
“ But this is confiscation. Far from it, it is resti-
tution. Those who cry for compensation for past
robbery, and shriek confiscation because the right
to rob in future is challenged, should bear in mind
that the men and women whom we would com-
pensate are these who are now stumbling halt-
clothed and half-fed from a pauper cradle to a
Dauper grave# in order that capitalists s/nd land-
lords may live in luxury and excess. The dead
have passed beyond compensation; it will be well
if the living do not call for vengeance on their
behalf. Our first principle as Socialists is that all
should be well-fed, well-housed, well-educated.
For this object we urge forward the revolution
which our enemies hysterically shriek at, and
frantically try to dam back. But we mean wrong
to none. Rather would we claim the aid of such
of the luxurious classes as are willing, so long as
they have still enough and to spare, to forego the
frightful privilege of feeding fat upon the wretch-
edness of others.”
And they conclude thus:—
“ Therefore, we say once more this is a class war:
we know it; we are preparing for it; we rejoice at
its near approach. We mean to break down com-
petition, and to substitute universal organisation
and eo-operatlon. There lie around us the neces-
sary methods: they need but to be applied. But
there are many difficulties and dangers, the power
of wealth is great, the unserupulousness of pro-
perty knows no bounds. We are all aware of
this: we see and do not shrink from the inevitable
struggle. But the numbers over against us, the
hosts who may be bribed to fight for their op-
pressors, even to their own hurt; there are thou-
sands, perhaps millions, of such men ? There are.
We know that, too. Rut in a cause like ours, we
refuse to recognise difficulties; with such misery
around u?, we cannot stop to calculate forces, witn
such a future before us, we will never count
heads.”
At which we will for the present leave them in the
hands of our readers.

thought some one on the surface had been playing

more than being compelled to go into a milliner s

How different is the case when it is the pa lent

During the year 1881, 10,768 dozen packs of

The Wesleyan Spectator— a Victorian

other day that it kept a “ special detective.” We
suppose the principal duties of this gentleman are
to find out what particular lock-up the theologi-

out when they are wanted. It is a useful, but not
a glorious occupation.

than rejoicing. For the small community in which

I “ Let ua pray,” says the Christian Colo-

avocations, that they should abstain from all mirth

various places of worship, should unite in con-
fession of sin. and in prayer, for a return of pro-
sperity.” And yet Adelaide, which is now asked
to pray more, is known as “the city of churches,
the Australasian holy of holies, the paradise of
chadbindiaoa, the home of the greasy deacon and
the smug elder with the shiny face. It is, of course,
also known as the lair of the sainted fraud—of the
insurance swindle, of the building society swiralc,
of the bank swindle. The Commercial Bank of
S.A., which has just gone bung, leaving behind it
a shameful record worthy only of the “ Glasgow ”

local saints. Most of tee directors were very pious

“An Old Chartist”: The Hon. Graham
Berry was not always an out-and-out Protectionist
and Radical. In the early days when he kept a
grocer’s shop in Prahran (Vie.), he, as the mouth-
piece of the Free-traders, attended meetings called
by those two staunch Democrats, Wilson Gray
and J. J. Walsh, and there opposed the objects of
the meetings. Afterwards when he saw that
Protection F and Radicalism were coming he es-
poused the progressive cause. The recent Tas-
manian Treaty, which he launched in Parliament
and then had to withdraw, showed that he was not
an uncompromising Protectionist. We admit that
Graham Berry was on the right track some eight
or ten years ago, hut then he went off again. The
whole of Victoria was thoroughly rouged to the
baneful effects of Conservatism, and the electors
would have stuck to Berry through thick and thin
if he had stood firm and true and led them on to a
more honoured victory. But place and pay have
always been to Berry like the proverbial bunch of
carrots to the donkey—he never failed to seize it.

Larry Foley, some people may not know*
had a little while ago at his Gymnasium, in Syd-
ney, two good-natured brown bears, which from
time to time afforded 44 the boys ” much amuse-
ment These bears were wonderful athletes in
their way; they knew every hold and trick in
wrestling, and (when safely muzzled so that they
couldn’t bring their teeth to bear on you in the
course of a friendly bout) you couldn’t have
wished for better-humored or more skilful oppo-
nents in the art of which Miller is a master. After
they had thoroughly learned the science of
wrestling—in which they ultimately became so
proficient that no one ever thought of seriously
tackling antagonists who were as quick as Victor,
and weighed at least lOst. more than the ordinary
man—it was for a while designed that they should
be perfectly educated in the 44 noble art,” and
sent across the water to knock out Sullivan, but
the idea was abandoned and the bears packed off
to Paddy’s Market. They had, in fact, almost been
forgotten when Frawncls Hablgall, M.L.A., the
other night denounced bear-fighting as an over-
rated and immoral amusement Looked at from a
theological standpoint, Mr. Habigail’s jeremiad
was all very well; but a recent (alleged)
event proves that Foley, after all, was but
teaching what is necessary knowledge to
all persons visiting Zoological Gardens or
other places where bears are kept. For the
credulous Sydney dailies last week described a
fight of a novel character, which came off at the
Sydney Zoo, between Mr. Schluter, a gentleman
visiting the grounds, and one of the brown bears
which reside there permanently. The bear had
endeavoured to snatch a little girl through the
bars of his cage, and had already drawn her
towa’dshim with a view of making a closer in-
spection, when Mr. Schluter appeared on the scene.
Jumping from 15 feet above into the outer circle
of the bear’s boxl ig ring, he placed himself in
position, and led elf with "a terrific right bander ”
on the bear’s conk. Bruin, though he has been
long enough in the ring to have learnt something
of the game, did not fight a fair battle, for he im-
mediately seized his antagonist’s finger in his
mouth, and commene ul to 4 ’ chaw.” Mr. Schluter
got on with his left, and countered smartly, when,
oa his right baud beiig released, he popped in
another 44 hot ’un," and the bear retired to his
corner. The child was then escorted to its owners,
and the bear-flghte’’ left the grounds, after en-
quiring his way to the hospital. His little finger
was rather badly torn. The account, as furnished
by the papers, of the manner of the child’s
entry into the pit, reads somewhat vaguely:
“Those who are acquainted with the place will
remember that the pit is situated oa the edge of
an embankment, from the top of which visitors
look down some 15ft. at the bears below; while at
the bottom, whica is level with the floor of the
pit, visitors are only separated from the animals,
two in number, by two iron gates—an outer and
an inner one. The former had, through some
gross carelessness on the part of the attendants,
been left open, and the child, who had strayed away
from her parents, toddled into the intermediate
calling out 4 DoggD, doggie,’ under the evi-
dent impression that the brown monsters were the
familiar domestic animals so dear to all children.”
It is surprising that such 41 gross carelessness”
should have bean exhibited by the attendants in
the matter of closing the gates, and a vacancy
should at once be o.tatedia that portion of the
staff, hut it is more than surprising, it is almost
incredible, that those who went near enough to
hear her call 44 Doggie, doggie,” were not near
enough to ri-move her from her danger ms
proximity to suideu de*th, without waiting assist-
ance f-om one so far above. Mr. Schluter is pro-
bably the only man in the world who has knocked
a Pro-'a bear r ut in two rounds, and the perform-
anci, for a c oss-handed lighter, who. according to
toe -Sydney D. l\, “ leans off with a terrific right,”
is a best o.i record.
On the evening of Friday, the 19th inst.,
the Goulburn volunteers had a march out, headed
by the premier band. It was stated that they
were to tramp out to the residence of Mr. F. Tait
M.L A, but that gentleman not having been able
to secure all the bread and beef in town in time to
entertain his would-be visitors, sent word that he
was not ready for them. Here was a pretty go.
About 100 men had assembled expecting that
which delighteth the average Briton-a cheep
feed. The officers decided that, failing a cheap
blow-out, the next best thing was a cheap drink;
so the order was given to form fours and take
Bartlett’s brewery by storm. Never did thirty
men march so willingly nor band play so loudly.
On arrival, the genial brewer let the goat-killers
loose amonvst the beer-barrels, and for a time one
would have thought all the thirsty souls had been
let out of Hades. Some of the heroes oould ba
seen lying down with their mouths under the'taps
and in about half an hour all the stringy had been
consumed. The captain then made a delightful
little speech, commencing: 44 Gentlemen,—Ahem I

In Mr. Fronde’s new book, “Oceana,” he
says that in all his Australian travels he saw
nothing but prosperity; he did not, in fact, see
one discontented face. It always makes us glad
to find ourselves in accord with great men, and,
with Mr. Wigzell’s permission, will stake our wig
(time-payment) and write out from long expert,
ence what we have to say in support of our
learned brother’s contention. We have seen men
who have tramped from one end of this Oontiaent
totae other searching for—what’s it called—it s
so long ago-anyhow, for that yellow metal, and
we have seen them bald, bent, and grey, stepping
cheerfully into thiold men’s asylum, at Parra-
matta, there to live in pampered ease, and to doze
off at intervals on toe combined influence of
Quong Tart’s bung and subtle melody; and wa
nave seen them die without a friend. But were
they discontented ? Not a bit. They were gay at
the prospect of death. We have seen business men
who alio ved themselves no sleep nor rest, build
up a fortune, and find themselves, through the
kindness of another cheerful Australian, reduced
to poverty in a day Discontented ? On th« con-
trary, hilarious We have seen a stout gentleman
leap out of his bed and skip down to the back
yard, armed with a heavy boot, to slaughter the
melodious oat. We have seen the boot miss
the mark, and the old gentleman limp
up-stairs with half a cord of fine splinters in his
feet, sit down on the side of his bed and delve
them out for one hour with a penknife, and while
the cat outside resumes his nocturnal note, hum
all the while “ Scenes that are Brightest,” and
“Life's a Bumper.” No discontent with him,
Men wandering on the Old Man Plains know
exactly where to drop in on a free restaurant,
where juicy steaks and bottled beer are ready at
all hours. Nobody pays rent, notody ever gets
sick, everybody is eager to lend everybody else
money, and the only shadow of discontent tljat
fids over our countenance is that nobody will
apply to anybody for a loan. The weather is never
cold and never m uggy, the daily papers are a per-
fect storm of wit and vivacity, our clergy are
learned, eloquent, and holy, and our politic! ms
wise and self-sacrificing. Our lawyers scorn to
take fees, our farmers and squatters have always
abundance of water, and there is never a sheep
lost from drought, or a squatter squeezed by a
bank. Bills are always honoured, and overdrafts
may be had for the asking. What more would
you have? Why should there be a discontentd
face ?
Certain Sydney clerics who rarely or
never visit the theatres but are possessed of a
marvellous stock of theatrical lore, for the own-
ership of which they eccount on the “I am cre-
dibly informed, beloved brethren ” principle, have
of late taken in hand the task of pulling the move
out of their dramatic brother’s eye. Among
them is the Rev. J. Barnier. wbo last week warned
his hearers against the unholy fascinations of a
society, the leading idols of which were such im-
proper persons as Sara Bernhardt. “ Let anyone
with David s spirit stand in the vestibule of a
theatre for five or ten minutes,” remarked Mr.
Barnier, 44 and listen to all t.ne talk going on there
and see what Is proceeding, and he would surely
pass from it with the prayer, 4 O Lord, t'rn away
mine eyes from beholding vanity’” We do so
long for the sweet by-and-bye when the stage
shall have been purified, and the B iv. Mr.
Barnier, in his capacity as pantaloon, is
invited by the wicked clown to

slightly different character was the address of
the Rev. G. North Ash, who last week frankly
owned that though the modern stage was im-
moral, toe sh .ws provided ,by modern parsons
were lamentably lacking in humour. In the
sweet by-and-oye, perhaps, we shall have the rev.
gentleman leading on to the purified stage a
fcrupulously-atiired young lady, about whoso
sanctified person there lingers not a suspicion of

we determined to make a special feature of the
paper, and with this view engaged a gentleman of
piety and erudition to edit this department. He
knew the Lord’s Prayer right through, with the
Doxology thrown In. Wo are sure Of this, because
we had it taken down in shorthand from his
own mouth, and showed it to a minister
of our acquaintance who said it was all right. We
regret to say that our religious department was
not so generally appreciated as we thought it
deserved to be, This might have been because
our religious editor—though otherwise a pious
and God-fearing man—was giyeq to mixing his

lingering suspicion which has since developed
into certainty that ihe was not entirely orthodox
in his views. He would-so some of our readers
have informed us since—run amuck at the Thirty-
nine Articles in one paragraph, stone the scarlet
woman in the next, exalt the Church of Rome in
the third, and jomat the Westminster confession
and praise the Presbyterians with r-ckless obem-
don down the rest of the column We might still
have been in ignorance of all this, and still em-
ploy leg him if he bad not taken himself off one
day with, as he informed us, a seven-horned beast
out of the Revelations who had called for him.
We have never seen him since, and have
never since attempted to popularise theology.
We looked to poetry, however, to pull us
through. It has stood by us pretty well
so far, but we have grown gray in the
struggle. After four or five years of unceasing
effort to imbue our poetical staff with ideas of
moral responsibility and the ethical beauty of oc-
casional sobriety, we have had to retire heart-
broken from the task. We have, therefore, set
apart the lowest cellar in the basement for their
use when they eorqe to this office. It is only at
times, and faintly, that muffled sounds arise from
the depths to disturb the even tenor of 01^ just-
ness above. Our artist, who has a genius for me-

Laureate Lift is <he name he has a jen it—which
goes down into the cellar, takes on board the par-
ticular poet we may require at the time tee
humorous, sentimental, or elegiac bard, as
the case may be—and slowly raises him from
the ct liar to the editorial iloor- Before
entering the editorial office he is shaved,
shamocced, and turned out clothed and m
his right mind. A copper helmet n then p aced
upon his head-this is to prevent him from blow-
ing out any panes of gists with his hiccups. When
he has written his ode or lyric, or elegy, or what-
ever it is, the bard-keeper draws him from the
Castilian spring—the classical name our. poets give
the rum cask-half-a-gallon of inspiration, and
then hustles him into the lift, and rashes him down
to the cellar again. With these precautions, and
by these means, we have been able to manage our
poets pretty fairly, but It Is a weary task when all
is said. We have been led away so much by
thinking of our troubles that we almost forget

He was reading from the Evening News
a fearful and harrowing account of a fatal acci-
dent, touched here and there with all the blood-
curdling finish of a true sensational artist, while
she paused in her occupation of sewing some
fringe on to a complicated garment which re-
sembled a pair of win’ sails for a toy barque, and
listened to the reading with a 6 x 4 gape of wonder
and admiration. Pausing to take breath, and
allow the seeds of horror to take root in the mind
of his spouse, he adjusted his Brazilian pebbles
and continued:—”The carnage was frightful. At
one portion of the wreck we saw a charred and
blackened corpse taken from the mass of debris
Mutilated almost beyond recognition, it made us
shudder to gaze upon what was once the

and, as they bore away all that remained of earth,

mused on the mutability of human life and
breathed a prayer for the departed— 1 Roderick
was the man killed ? ’—soul of this unfortunate
victim of a fatal accident. ‘ Roderick W. M’Klir-
toch, was the man killed? ’ ” Again, adjusting his
spectacles, after carefully wiping them, he slowly
finished the harrowing article. Then, placing the
paper;solemnly upon his knees, he replied: “ Really,
my dear, the paper doesn’t say I”

It was somewhat of early morn, and the
vice-regal crowd lay heols-up on the grass in the

marked the Chief, after a gloomy silence, “ you

longer depend ; and certainly the terms in which
Lord B couched his refusal to represent me at

press me with the idea that he is properly
imbued with an appreciation of the splendour
and magnificence of his appointment. Leigh

he would shed his ast drop of blood in my

Writing about the picnic fashion so pre-
valent amongst Australians at holiday time, and
describing more particularly the favourite Sydney
resorts, the San Francisco Chbonicle writes-
“Then, lest the holiday spirit should flag, there
are special picnics, such as the bakers’ picnic, the
drapers’ picnic, the butchers’ picnic, &c., even
down to the undertakers’ picnic, of which ghouls’
feast there is no record kept as to whether the I
tables be coffins and the utensils bones, though on
the occasion of their first jovial picnic they drank,
one and all, * Success to the trade.’ ” L tus sing-
le there reason good that the undertaker
And mute, should e’er in the dull black drape,
Nor share in the joy of the dusty baker,
But cling, all glum, to the gruesome crape;
Should he picnic ne’er ’neath the leafy shading.
And hear then never their voices sound,
But be ever grey-gloom and grief parading
For those they’ve placed in the silent ground ?
“Not much,”—with a good clean skull to drink
from,
The eye-holes plugged with a piece of cork,
And with food galore not a man should shrink
from
Firm belief that their jaws and their lungs can
work ;
That their laugh is loud as the butcher’s, hearty,
Their mirth as mad as the baker’s bold.
For fun let us go to their jovial party—
They’ll sell us their grief when we’re dead and
cold.

A gentleman rejoicing in the historic name
of Hubbard—John Hubbard—publishes in the Mel-
bourne Hbiialp “an apology to the officers,
soldiers, and attendants of the Salvation Army at
Richmond for creating a disturbance.” The ad.
doesn’t mention whether John apologises under
pressure of legal or religious conviction; but we
prefer to regard him as another Harmy trophy,
and will sing accordingly:—
John Hubbard he went to a meeting
(His motive was mischief, we fear)
The drums and the cymbals were beating,
But Johnny did nothing but jeer;
The “ Major ” discoursed about saving
Of souls, sometimes shouting a prayer—
But the way that J.H. kept behaving
Was shocking to everyone there.
He laughed when they let off a “ volley,”
No loud " hallelujah ” or hymn
Caused John to repent of his folly—
They made no impression on him.
In vain did each “ lassie ” and “ captain ”
Dilate upon spiritual joys—
For iniquity Johnny was wrapt in,
So he merely kept making a noise.
But oh, blessed end to our story I
The sinner will sin nevermore;
The Harmy won Johnny to glory.
As it’s won over hundreds before.
'Gainst the faith which removeth a mountain
No rowdy young scoffer can stand—
The Harmy popped John in the fountain,
And now he plays bass in the band.

'• last week we referred to a pathetic
little incident, in which the chief actors were
Queen Victoria and a cabhorae. Her Majesty saw
a cabhorae drop down dead in the stroet at Wind-
sor, and next day England rang with the news
that she had “caused intimation to be convoyed
to the lamenting owner that he should be presented
with another horse from the Royal stables.”
That touching yarn was detailed, enlarged upon,
preached about, and slobbered over. Amid it all,
one man remained unmoved. ’Twas the unhappy
cabman. That royal intimation about the royal
gee-gee was all a gorgeous purple fable. The
Queen did send an equerry to enquire respecting
the fate of the fallen horse, and there the matter
ended. “Wlththatwomanly sympathy for which
the Queen has ever been, &o., &o., &c.” she asked
the equerry if the horse was really dead. ‘‘It is,
may it please your Majesty,” replied the flunkey.
“AhI” murmured Victoria Regina, in a voice
shaken by emotion, “just as I expected. Drive
on, coachman.”
• ■ •
Is there no philanthropist to take up the
cause of the poor Victorian prisoner? It appears

Mr. John SteAvart, M.L.C., of Sydney, has
a down on “ play acting ” In schools. At the
breaking-up of some Sydney academies it is not
unusual for the advanced pupils to perform some
harmless plai-usually written for them by the
headmaster or his wife —where the maximum of
high morality is cunningly Introduced with amlnl-
mum of lov e-making, it is Impossible to dispense
with the latter altogether. So long as hingsand
queens, courtiers, and ladies of the bed-chamber
are represented at all, there must be flirting—a
dlsctimioating public insists upon It. The idea of
having Henry VILE, and Anne Boleyn pass each
other on the lobby without asking what o'clock it
is, is simply stupid. Still, there is a real objection
to school-theatricals, although Mr. Stewart has
missed it. It is this. The pieces are gener-
ally of an historical character, intended, no
doubt, to Impress on the pupils eorrect opinions
regarding famous persons or events. Then, as the
plays are composed or adapted by the teachers,
they actually convey the latter's views concerning
those occurrences or characters. Now, history is
a universal liar, so that no two men were ever
known to quite coincide in their ideas of past
events. Thus, in a Protestant school, the speeches
put in the mouth of William of Orange, or of
Elizabeth, would materially differ from those at-
tributed to the same persons by the authorities of
a Homan Catholic academy. We remember a
little French play of the battle of Waterloo,
where all the awkward boys in the school, with
a club-footed pupil teacher as Duke of Wellington
represented the British army, and after the first vol-
ley, were seen tumbling over each other—the com-
mander-m-ohief under—to escape from the “ Old
Guard,” oonaisting.of half-a-dozen lads from the in-
fant class led by Ney, a baby of four, with a Scotch
tei rier charger and a cork-screw for a sabre—
Napoleon, a warrior of five, with a bell-topper
covering him to the chin, followed with a squad-
ron of cuirassiers mounted on broom-handles.
The hero of Austerlltz, having been helped off with
his hat, called for three cheers for La Belle France
before starting at the thick end of a sugarstlck
thrown to him from the stalls. But the most
thrilling historical school drama we remember to
have witnessed was at St. Killan's Homan Catholic
school, Sandhurst (Vic.) The subject was the
French Revolution, and wa Relieve the late Dean
Baokhaus was the author. Anyway, there
wasn’t a dry eye in the crowd when An-
toinette came on leading the Dauphin by the
ear. The heir of St. Louis was a sturdy i, HI
chap from Irishtown. who had the’ repJtm? 1 ®

"TOO MUCH GLORY."
[Respestfully addressed to his Worship the Mayor of
Syndey.]
When you were chosen, well, we thought
You, certainly, are plain,
But once installed, and lo, unsought
You’d lavish gold like rain I
We thought that you’d ring fairy bells
As in th’ Arabian Nights,
And turn this city of bad smells
To one of Pure Delights.
You and the “ boys,” the papers teach,
Are not on speaking terms I
And ev’ry Aldermanic speech
Sows, thick, Rebellion's germs.
We're waterless;-the city ’sfoul;
And you, the Champion Cleanser,
Are laid up—it is time to grown —
“ Bad with the influenza.”
Put it about that you’ve resigned—
It is the old, old story;
The long black night-gown, cat skin-lined,
For you’s proved too much glory.
Take our advice, your comfort win;
You’ll find it for the best:—
Lie curled up till December in
Your Annandale mare’s-nest.
ONLY RILEY.
“ The Warialda to Tam worth mail-coach
was stuck up by an armed man, who said ‘he
was only Riky,’ and who took away the mail bags,
but did not molest the driver or passengers.”—
.Daily paper.
He came not with a rip or rush,
But stole out softly from the bush,
And with a smile he
Said, “ There’s no need to look so pale,
Just hand me down the bloomin’ mail,
I’m only Riley.”
Delightful phrase 1 impressive, short
And sweet, and with a wicked sort
Of fiumour slyly
Suggested, thou a long-felt want
Hast well supplied—our hand upon’tl
“I’m only Riley 1”
How often have we seen a sleek
And unctuous villain’s smile so speak;
Ah, yesl—the while he
The widow and the orphan robbed,
That smile said, as the loot he fobbed—
“It’s only Riley I”
How often—how the memories crowd—
Have we known patriots tierce and loud.
But desp’rate wily,
Wink as they laid felonious hands
Upon the public purse or lands—
“It’s only Riley ?”
And lawyers, too; have we not seen.
When they had noosed a client green,
Them add agilely
Their costs up—fearsome costs and wild—
And tag the same. They also smiled,
“It’s only Riley I”
Have we (thank God they’re dead) not too
Engaged us brilliant writers who
Have come in vilely
Drunk—.urn running down each beard,
Whose one excuse was hiccuped weird—
“It’s only Riley ?”
Ah! yes. indeed. Immortal phrase,
Thou hast before thee length of days;
Thou Attest well each viler phase
When uttered drily.
The mad, tbe bad, the dupe, the tool,
Tne knave, tne drunkard, and the fool,
Have one excuse—sublimely cool—
“ It’s only Riley.”
THE SONG OF THE BREAD.
(After Hood.)
With fingers weary and worn,
With flats as big as a club,
A prisoner sit, in a prisoner's “toga,”
Trying to tackle his grub ;
Chew, chew, chew,
At morsels as heavy as lead,
While darker and darker his countenance grew,
He sang this song of the bread.
“ Bite, bite, bite,
And disliking it all the time;
Bite, bite bite—
Is this how they conquer crime ?
Sour, and lumpy, and hard—
Hard, and lumpy, and sour;
Still striving to swallow a bit of the crumb
That’s been sticking this last half-hour.”
“ ’Tis OI for the bygone days.
Before I made one • mistake
The days long fled, when I usually fed
On a chop or a filleted steak—
Fat, and juicy, and thick,
Thick, and juicy, and fat;
O, bllmy I To think that a covey like mo
Must solace his stomach with that!"
“ Sometimes I long for Death—
The phantom that ‘ square ’ folks dread;
I should but smile at his terrible shape
If he brought me some decent bread—
Nice little rolls, all hot:
Crusty, and tempting, and sweet,
French loaves, or German-I wouldn’t care what,
But this isn’t flb to eat.”
“ Oh, warders, with waistcoats round.
Oh, warders, robust and stout.
It isn t my teeth that I mind so much,
But my temper is wea'ing out.
Swear, and grumble, and curse—
Curse, and grumble, and swear.
Can the chaplain find any prisoner's mind
In a proper condition for prayer'?”
With fingers weary ani worn,
With fist as big as a club,
A prisoner sat, in a prisoner’s “togs,”
Trying to tackle his grub;
Chew, chew, chew,
At morsels as heavy as lead—
While darker the frown on his countenance grew
(Ah, that the loaves might be spongy and new I)
He sang this song of the bread.

“Editor Bulletin— Dear Sir,— l want to tell
you about our new horse pa bought hero last
week. His name is Dodger, and he is a grey horse.
We haven’t got him now; he left. Pa said it
would be cheaper to buy a horse and buggy than
to be always riding on the tram. So he bought
Dodger and a dog-cart. Well, the first day pa and
Mr. Johnson were all the morning trying to fix the
harness right. They didn’t seem to understand
much about it, anyway. Pa got the breastplate
where the breeching goes, and when Mr, Johnson
wanted to change it pa got pretty mad, and asked
whose horse it was, and he said he didn’t know, if
everyone had their own. Perhaps it belonged to
and he kicked pa up against the hen house, after
which he set his tali at half-mast and hit out for
the Hawkesbury. When I climbed on top of the
gate post I just saw him travelling. The harness
which was on him was Hogging him at every jump,
and you bet he was moving. Pa got savage and
backed the dog-cart up near the hen house viol -
ously. The wheel went over Brlndle’s (our dog)
foot and he bit pa in the leg, and pa rushed in and
got his gub and shot him. I think that dog-cart is
for sale now. Pa says it’s not much used, anyway

Then pa called him a bad name, same as Ananias

they had a light for 30 minutes Then Mr. Johnson
knocked pa up against the thickest end of Dodger

Svdney Town Hall for the purpose of presenting
Mr. Playfair ana his amiable daughter each with a
souvenir purchased out of the surplus fMds left
from the picnic which was given to Mr. Playfair
shortly before the expiration of his term of omße.
A handsome silver epergne was tendered to tne
ex-Mayor, whilst Miss Playfair wss
of a beautiful gold watch and chain. The interest-
icg“ atfair was rendered more (or less) so by a tew
flowery speeches, in which eompliments were
pelted liberally at each other by aldermen ana the
ex-Mayor. It would hardly have been amiss if
someone had suggested that Mrs. Bailey (Mr. Ploy-
fair's sister) should receive some small acknow-
ledgment for all the trouble she took in assisting
her niece in the duties of Mayoress. Even a word
of thanks to that lady, wedged into the speeches,
would have been better than nothing at ail.

The beautiful floors of Needs’ Rooms were
thoroughly appreciated on Wednesday, the 34th ot
February, when about 160 guests responded to the
invitations issued by the three hosts, Captain
Pullen. Mr. Gubbins, and Mr. Stapleton, of H.M.d.
Lark. Some of the costumes were very pretty,
tulle being the prevailing material used by the
Youncr ladies, leaving the rich brocades and satins
to the matrons. Oae particular pretty costume
was worn by Miss Harbord, composed entirely of
black lace over white satin ; her hair done in a
crown at tbe top of her head was set off by an
aigrette, which suited the wearer admirably; Miss
Nellie Manning looked her best in a sombre tint ot
brown tulle; Miss Clara Manning mcardinal tulle;
Miss Throckmorton, perhaps, carried off the palm,
in light golden brown tulle, long nboons at the
back oflskirt, brown brocade bodice cut very low,
with just a strap across the shoulder, displaying
very white arms and shoulders. Two recent brides
were also of the company. Miss Cox was, per-
hans, the only debutante in white tulle; Miss
Labertouche looked well in pink; Miss Hay, in
white silk and net, looked charming; Miss Fischer,
in pink relieved by white lace, looked well; Miss
Richardson, in pale pink tulle and cardinal rib-
bons: Miss D'ckson's pale blue silksuited her well;
Mis Barley, in ivory silk and lace, looked stylish;
Miss »te hen, in cream cheaiue. tufted net and
■satin - Miss M- Manning, m black satin and net; the
Misses Busby, white and pale bue tulle. Amongst
the guests were Major-Genera land Mrs. Richard-
son. Colonel and Mrs. Roberts juieut - colonel and
Mrs Ai rey, Lieut. Clarke and Dr. Barsey (Miranda),
Capt Pike (a.M.S, Harrier), Capt. Taylor (W olve-

Macartnur, Mrs. and the Misses Denne, Capts.
Terry and Lee (A.B.C. s), Mr. Wailington, the

Sadowa, Glenmore-road, was a' scene of
gaiety on Tuesday, February 33, when the youthful
host and hostess entertained about 30 guests .to
celebrate the first anniversary o f their wedding
day. The floor was excellent and the music every-
thing that could be desired. Nothing could surpass
tbe attention of the host and hostess in their inde-
fatigable endeavours to make the evening a
thorough success. Black seemed toe prevailing
colour worn. The hostess was in blacK net and
bodice of black satin with a spray of natural sun-
flowers on the corsage; her sis<er donned a skirt of
white laco, high bodice of silk trimmed with
fnarabout; a pretty little fairy with golden hair
ooked nice in pule pink; a black lace skirt with
black satin bodice cut low with black net-tuffed
sleeves, relieved by a band of crimson velvet
around Ihe neck, hair done in large basket plaits,
suited the wearer to perfection; her sister in a
similar dress, bodieecut low (-which w»ssleeveless)
with crimson band around the neck, hair done
high, looked charming. The company broke up
about 3 a.m. after spending a most enjoyable
evening. + m *

Sydney, Wednesday.
My dear Belle,— Sydney just now is so decidedly
gloomy—nearly everybody whp is anybody is out
of town, and we whom various circumstances
compel to stay behind feel injured and listless.
There were a few faint efforts made last week to
cater for our amusement, but who can be amused
at anything in such weather ? The good-natured
officers of the Lark gave a dance one night in
Head’s Rooms; but whoever enjoys a dance in the
very height of summer must indeed be dancing
man. ana I never knew until this night what a lot
of mad men and women Sydney contained. An-
other diversion was Miss consett Stephen’s wed-
ding A pretty wedding it was too; but after all
there Is a goon deal of sameness about weddings,
and when they come so thick as they hive done
this year one gets pretty tired of that kind of
show, A rather nice conceit was given upon the
occasion of the opening of the new Convent in
Victoria-street, Darlinghurst, last—let me see—l
think it was Thursday night. Mrs. Rdev sang
“Judith” very beautifully, and Miss Cowley, the
“Evening Prayer,” from “Eli,” charmingly. A
novelty was the clever step-dancing of two youth-
ful children, but I was always under the impres-
sion that religious people objected to dancing,
therefore was rather surprised at this item finding
a place on the programme. The concert w»s well
attended and must have materially benefited the
convent fund.
It appears that what I told you about the
directors of a certain bank here enforcing several
stringent rules upon their clerks, has come to
their ears, and they (the directors) are simply
furious to think that somebody has had the
audacity to make their noble ideas of rulership
common gossip. They have threatened to give
instant dismissal to the clerk who has thus exposed
them if they can discover the identity of the
offending one, but although they have done
their utmost to “fix” him, their efforts have
so far proved futile. In the meantime, I have
made up my mind never to approach the vicinity
of any of these directors until the storm blows
over, lest their fury should in some way vent
Itself upon me; but there la one big bit of con-
solation in the knowledge that this little rumpus
has been the means of partially staying the hand
of oppression, for matters in that bank have been
a trifle easier for the poor clerks latterly. I am
more than glad about it. I’m simply jubilant I
I see that the ladies of Berne (Switzerland) have
been asserting their rights lately by insisting upon
giving tneir votes at the poll. It was decreed io
1853 that every female paying direct communal
rates had a right to vote, but at the same time it
was ordained that the vote should be recorded by
proxy only. This law, strange to say, has never
been put into force until this year, ana the citizens
of Berne were not a little startled to see 500 of
their womankind present themselves (or their
proxies) at the poll on one particular Sunday. Of
course, although the men could not interfere with
this bold venture, still the fair but determined
ones have been dreadfully quizzed and caricatured
by the opposite sex in consequence, iam sorry
now, dear, 1 did not take more particular notice
of the Bernese women when we passed through,
but as we only stayed a little over a day, I had
enough to do to take in the chief features of the
town. I remember noticing, however, that nearly
all of them wore long silver chains round their
necks and looked on the whole rather picturesque.
As for Berne itself, it is grand looking without
being beautiful, but the river which flows around
it is just splendid. Berne and its river have been
likened by some authoress—Frederlka Bremer, I
think—to the hard but powerful featured Roches-
ter and the sweet and fascinating Jane Eyre in
the charming book of that name, and although
the simile may seem queer, still for those who
have seen Berne, it tits very well.
I begin to think that “ civility ” in Sydney must
indeed be a very expensive article. As I have no
doubt you are aware, we have here our expen-
sive and our cheap shops; the former give you
good articles at big prices with civility thrown in,
whilst the latter provide you with goods of very
fair quality at a low rate, but— minus the civility,
and, tastioious as it may seem, I am bound to con-
fess I prefer the civility even if I have to pay a
high price for It. How would you like to be
served by a man in his shirt-sleeves who, if you
aren’t at once satisfied with the goods shown you,
tells you “you can either take them or leave
them, it’s all the same to him.” And then when,
after waiting an unconscionable time for your
change, it is tossed to you, and you, not being an
adept at sleight-of-hand tricks, fail to catch it,
whereupon It rolls on to the floor, and nobody
offers to pick it up for you—how would you like
this, I say ? It toe proprietors of these establish-
ments only knew what an amount of custom
they lose by not making sure that the at-
tendants possessed even ordinary politeness
1 am sure they would bo more careful in their
selection, 1 his little bit of experience had made
me absolutely fearful of cheap shops, and £ shill
have to be very hard pushed indeed before I ever
enter one again. I really believe such petty
worries as these are harder to bear than big trou-
bles, don’t you? Friends may prove faithless,
banks may break, and hearts may break, but as
sure as fate you can get over these things. People
sympathise witn you in a big trouble, aud you
pity yourself as well, till by constant attention and
sm'oothiag down the grievance is gradually worn
away, and nothing but a shadow remains ; but
who thinks of pitying you became a man whosniis
diess stuff to you is la h's shirt sleeves, or because
your cab.nan insists upon ddving on the tram
lines, which Is agony to a pe,sou with nerves, oi
because you are deprived of your plunge-bath
every other morning ? Nobody, of course ; and
that’s why our petty, every-day worries are so
hard to bear. Oh, be thankful, Belle, dear, that
you don’t live in a town where there are cheap
shops, tram lines, and a constant scarcity of water.
Of course ,you have read the accounts of the
extraordinary number of fatal accidents which
have occurred to young ladies in England and
France during the season, in consequence of
their ball-dresses being accidentally ignited
by candles. Now, the first thought that occurred
to me when I read of the sad affair was that it
was surely little short of madness using the dan-
gerous candle on the toilette table at all. Why not
the satety-lamp which we have had here for many
years? However, lam well aware that some
• eople cling to the usage of the old-fashioned
candle, and nothing will induce them to give it up,
but I don’t like to think of the number of deaths
which have been caused by this Imperfect, greasy,
and much-to-be-avolded light. In speaking of the
Misses Fltzroy, who were burnt to death just as
they were about to set out for a ball, a celebrated
doctor urges that the very best thing a person can
do when finding himself or herself on fire is to He
down flat on the floor; by so doing the flames
which, as you know always ascend, will have no-
thing to feed upon, and will quickly die out. You
may have noticed that people who are marked
with burns are generally disfigured about the face,
neck, and arms, which is quite natural when an up-
right position is persisted in. So if ever you have
the misfortune to catch fire try and remember
these injunctions, and it may be the means of sav-
ing you from disfigurement or even of preserving
your life.
I believe the Sydney Liedertafel people are busy-
ing themselves over their forthcoming concert,
which eventuates next Tuesday and which Lord
and Lady Carington have promised to attend, it
seems to me that since the Philharmonic Society
has started, and Herr Patek’s band has been
formed, the forces of the Liedertafel have-been
somewhat weakened. It can hardly be otherwise,
since musicians in Sydney, and especially instru-
mentalists, are not so plentiful that two new
societies can be Inaugurated without affecting the
parent one. But we shall see what they can give
us next week, spite of the Philharmonic and Herr
Patek.
The latest society sensation in London is the
news that the second son of a real live earl is
about to marry the daughter of one of the largest
London linen-drapers. This social levelling
appears to be making rapid strides just now, for it
is only the other day we heard that a woman of
title (Lady Granville-Qordon) whose coffers were
empty, had opened a milliner’s shop, and that dur-
ing Ascot week alone she had made £5OO profit out
of the people of wealth-new people—who flocked
to give their orders. Well, as somebody remarks
“it is really quite time this class of people bega
to earn their own livings.”
Do you remember seeing in an old album of
mine photographs of the Princess Royal and her
sisters, taken wearing little round turban ha'.s
which, I believe, were called the pork-pie shape ?
Well, that is the hat you will have to wear nex*
winter, and I know it will become you. You
not to wear it tipped very much forward, which
makes you appear to be foreheadless and w tu.
was considered good style in the old days, but you
must place the little round thing fair on top of
your head and let your curly fringe just peep
below the brim. They are coquettish little bats,
and, of course, will be mucn abused, and I very
much fear they will be worn by those whose long,
sallow, ancient faces will make them look ridi-
culous, but this is no more than what we have
always to cope with when an Inexpensive article
of fashion “ catches on.” Bo you get one as soon
as possible. Lady Carington generally dresses her
three little daughters in pure white—a sensible
plan, as there is nothing to beat white when a good
laundress is at hand; it never fades, you know
and is appropriate at all times. By the way,
would be quite refreshing to hear of someth!
Lady Carington does which is not either sensible
good-natured.
It has just this moment occurred to me
some of us promised to go to the Town Hall to-
night to hear a private rehearsal of Herr Patek s
Band. I am ever so glad I didn’t forget about it,
lor I see the programme contains many gems, and
besides I have heard such a lot about this same
band that I am quite curious to hear it. Not a
moment to lose.
Yours as ever.
MAB.
The Rev. Joseph Barnier, of Sydney, says
that “if Saint Paul were alive now he would not
go into a Sydney theatre.” No, he would go to the
Church of the Reverend J oseph, or to a Sunday
school picnic down the harbour, or church bazaar,
if he wanted real sport.
“Baokblocks,” thus writes us, concerning
‘‘The Fate of a Poet”:—“Dear Bclubtin,—A. few
years ago there existed down in one of the
Arcadian towns of Riverina, among others less
worthy of notice, a young man who gained for
himself a name, what is locally known as the
" rally,” and a six-by-three allotment in the local
cemetery, all in a very short space of time. He
was a bank clerk, a youth whose gigantic mind
when not engaged in calculating the interest on
the overdrafts of the neighbouring “ cockatoos”
(in the Bank in which he was employed), sought
the gentle muse, and broke forth in verse. Un-
like the average poet of the plains, his odes were
varied, and had a wide range—one week a touch-
ing poem on a defunct wombat, from his pen,
would appear, while at other times some thrlll-
ingly descriptive lyric of his, on the danger
attendant on the capture of the bounding
paddymelon would fill the poet’s corner of
the local paper. But in an unlucky moment
he dashed off a few little stanzas on “ Love.”
and after decorating them with various
crosses to represent kisses, he posted them
to his girl, the only daughter of the richest
squatter in the district, whose stations ranged
from the limpid waters of the Murrumbidgee to
the red-gum forests of the G-ulpa. The wool-king,
however, had a decided objection to this daughter
marrying anyone below the rank of an M.P. or a
50-guinea land agent, and knowing she had more
than a passing regard for the bank cieik, decided
on a very mean plan of stopping the correspond-
ence, viz, intercepting all her letters. He
accordingly arranged with the post-office that no
letters for the station should be delivered to any-
one but himself, and he regularly wont every
morning and got them. When he received the
poetry intended for his daughter, like a certain
ancient individual whose doings are on record,
“he was sorely troubled.” After reading it a
few times he started *• on the booze.” In the
afternoon, a little while after the bank had
closed, he lurched up to the front door
and started banging on it with his whip-
handle. By ill-luck the poet went to see what was
wanted. With unsteady hand he of the flocks and
herds caught the versifier by the scruff, and an
immediate adjournment to the gutter took place,
and then a select melee was begun, ticreams,
oaths, tooth-picks, fists, stock-whip, billets-doux,
and sheepwash tobacco intermingled for some
time, until the police arrived and restored order.
Then the old man up and explained the cause of
the trouble, and the manager of the bank, wap
was in the crowd, promptly told the poet that his
services were dispensed with. That night he left
the town—no one knew where he went to. About
a week after his body was found stuck on a snag
in the river. Nothing was found on him—not even
a poem. His girl expressed no sorrow on hearing
of his death, but simply remarked 41 that she sup-
pose l that when they- found him he didn’t look
over-gay,” and within a few u onths married an
aristociatio young station manager, wh.se father
ran tne dustcart la tne town close by. The poet s
remains lie in a quiet corner of tne cemetery, only
» peg with a number on it marking his last resting
place. Crows olten alignt on this and mys-
teriously peer down on thci grave and taw, as
much as to say—“ Such is the late of poets.”

pyrmont Regatta duly eventuated on

who finished first, but the prize was awarded to
Matterson, on the ground that Power had fouled

Says the organ of the Sydney Mercantile
Bowing Ciub, the Evening Nooze:— “Mr. Arthur
Fittes, of Melbourne, having won the Challenge
Sculls last Saturday week, has decided to retire on
his rank. He claims to be the amateur champion
of Australia, but how he won the title is a little
nuzzling to the rowing men of this colony. He
bases his claim to this title on winning the Krug
Champagne Cup, but this trophy was advertised
a g‘open to all amateur scullers,’ and not a word
was ever said about the championship. Mr. Brett
is still open to accommodate tbe Victorian, and to
orive him a chance of earning the title he has
usurped.” The title of champion amateur sculler
of the colonies lies between Messrs. Fittes and
Brett, and as the former defeated our representa-
tive for the Krug Cup, if anyone has a right to be
considered “ champion,” it is certainly Fittes.
That George Brett was something like a stone
below his rowing-weight and mere fit to take to
his bed than a boat the day he met Arthur Fittes,
we can assert as a fact, but it is also a fact that
Fittes defeated him, and until Brett reverses the
decision, Fittes is amateur champion, if there is
such a title. Brett will be in Melbourne in April
with the eight-oar crew, and the opportunity
should prove a good one for the rivals to meet

The Y.R.C. were fortunate both as regards
weather and attendance on the opening day of
their autumn meeting at Flemington. The ball
was set rolling with the Essendon Stakes, for
which event Winchester had the call at 11 tc 8, but
the 10 to 1 chance, Sandal, proved too much for the
big gun, and the mare won easily with half a
length to tbe good of Winchester, who beat Regi-
nald by a length. A quintette put in an appear-
ance for the Ascot Vale Stakes, which proved an
easy victory for Chesham by a length from Blair-
gowrie; the favourite, Phillip Augustus, running
into a place three lengths away. Matchlock and
First Prince started equal favourites at 7 to 5 for
the St. Leger Stakes. The Prince led into the
straight running, but approaching the distance
Hales took Matchlock up without an effort, and
passing First Prince won comfortably by a couple
of lengths, Remus three lengths away third.
Thirty sported silk for the Newmarket Handicap,
William Cell and Silvermioe being most fancied at
5 to 1 each, Mozart being next in demand at 7 to 1,
William Tell j umped away with the lead and won
from start to finish, Silvermine four lengths away
second, hiapier a length and a half away third.
The jaw-breaking Munwyrtina won the Hopeful
Stakes irom Don Giovanni, Tuscarora third.
Gipsy’s Warning started first favourite for the
Brunswick Stakes, and finished the day’s sport by
winning the race by a head from St. Odille, Lesbla
a length and a half away third.

Though nothing has been definitely-settled
at the time of our writing, In all probability the
gladiators, “Professor” Jackson and Michael
Dooley, will meet in a six-round encounter at
Foley s Hall within a few days. Both heavy,
scientific men, the match should prove the best
Sydney has seen since the celebrated contest be-
tween Miller and Foley. Tbe contest, should it
come off, will altogether occupy 23 minutes—lB
minutes’ fighting and five minutes’ spell, if
Queensberry contests are to be built up in Sydney,
It; will be more by the aid of six-round contests
than fights “to a finish.” As a rule, if a man does
not succumb in five or six rounds of glove-fight-
ing, the pair become too weak to knock each other
out, and the contest runs into hours Instead of
minutes, and stands a good show of coming to a
termination on the win, tie, or wrangle principle.
Boxing la Sydney has arrived at a state of respec-
tability beyond the most sanguine expectations of

limited extent that can keep it up to the mark.

The Balmain Rowing Club had a great
send-off on Saturday last, when the Governor and
his lady put in an apnearance at the opening cere-
mony. The fact of Carington’s presence brought
together a crowd which, under other circum-
stances, would as soon see the Balmain workb g
man give his order to Kirby for a coffin as to Don-
nelly and Sullivan for a string-test. Lady Caring-
ton unfurled the colours, his lordship launched a
skiff, and the club was declared opened. An ad-
journment was then made to the upper regions,
where champagne and the next approach to a
Turkish bath were gone through at one and the
same time.

The intercolonial eight-oar crew were out
on Saturday last in a clinker, and visited the Bal-

The cup match between the Warwicks
afld Carltons was finished on Saturday, victory
going to the Warwicks on their first innings of
167, ss against 138 made by the Carltons. Tne junior
contingent of tne Warwicks proved a valuable
acquisition to the team, and thsir victory wa ; in
no small degree owing to Ironside and Oonnan,
who both bowled remarkably weil, the latter clean
bowling Burton, Turner, and C. Bannerman.

The Gymnasium, George-street, Sydney,
was, on Saturday evening, the rendezvous ot the
crowd who admire the manly game of knuckles.
The piece de resistance was the turn-up between
Dooley and the champion amateur, though the spsr
between Lawson and Burgess proved to be the
light of the evening, their four rounds beieg so
merry that the referee, Ted Ellis, bad to order an
extra three minutes before he could pick the win-
ner. Burgess fought a very plucky light, and
with a little more science be could make a good
fight with “ little Jim " Fuller and Smith opened
the ball, and in a fairly-fought battle the former
had decidedly the best of it. Puller is improving
greatly in the use of his left hand, and will eome
out the right end of the horn directly. Mackay
and Selby fought a rather humorous fight, in
which the game seemed to be pretty considerably
burlesqued, neither man appearing to know
exactly what to do with the other at the oppor-
tune moment. We observed several opportuni-
ties in which Mackay could have scored, and
noticed various instances where Selby might have
nominated Mackay as a suitable candidate for the
cemetery, but these chances were not availed of,
and the men were called off. Lawson ai d Bur-
gess fought a very even fight, in which the darkey
nad but little the best of it. White and the un-
assailable Laurence had a merry turn up, in which
Foley, as usual, had slightly the worst of it. Then
Dooley and the champion amateur stepped into the
ring and fought a nice friendly little spar, in
which neither evidenced any great anxiety to
damage the other’s frontispiece. In fact, it was
tolerably apparent that each man was holding a
bit in reserve, and did not feel disnosed to show
the full strength of his hand.

The Sydney Water Police Magistrate gave
his decision on Tuesday ia the Millie (s.) and the
sailing-boat Mallard collision case, wherein the
owner of the Mallard charged the captain ot the
Millie with running into him ia Sydney har-
bour. The result of the case has caused much
j >y amongst steamer captains of sportive tenden-
cies, since they now find it is competent for them
to run down as many sailing-boats s they please
at a shilling a pop. This, it seems to us, is very
reasonable. Hold on tilt the Watson’s Bay boat
nears our landlord again, as it did last Sunday.
There will be no fear then of his coming round on
Monday morning with a bag of gold and badgering
us for twelve-and-sixpence. ’

The result of the English Waterloo Cup
again proves the sound policy of depending upon
publicly-tried performers for coursing events.

while Coomassie won outrignttwo years in succes-

No very startling play was shown in the
recent billiard mated between Joe Byrtes and
Harry Power, for £lOO aside and the “ champ on-
ship ” of Victoria. Byrnes was credited with tne
biggest break of the evening (.63), but Power ulti-
mately won by 77 points, after more than tour
hours’ play. This is poor “ctampton” form,
indeed, for professionals, and we fancy there is
more than one amateur in Victoria who could
take down either man’s number if he felt so dis-
posed. Byrnes and Power are matched again for
£3OO aside.
A BUSHMAN SPEAKS
General Gordon, bitterly reproaching the supine
and vacillating Government of Great Britain,
said—“ You people in England who fare on the
best and sleep in comfortable beds, forget to realise
the hunger, privations, and dangers which beset us
here at Khartoum ” This is a very common
phase of selfishness. Seated beside a cheerful Are
we are apt to Ignore the sufferings of those
abroad and exposed to the bitter cold. Enjoying
our well served dinner, we bestow but little
thought upon the cravings of the destitute and
starving. We cuddle our personalities too much,
and hug our comforts the more, as they contrast
with the miseries of those of our fellow creaturts
who Lck them. The storm may roar and batsle
without: so much the snugger are we within. We
do not trouble our comcieaces with the reflection
that, abroad on the ocean, sailors, wet and cold,
and in dire peril are fighting the eluments. We
heed not that in tne weird bush the shivering
drover watches his cattle through the long nights.
Cola and dicached with rain, or haply parched by
thirst, he must be on the alert always. Hard
work and hard tare are his lot. No cosy arm chair
or warm fire, or merry chat, or toothsome supper
for him! His place ia the distribution of Fate, is
one in which tne factor of comfort or ease eaters
not. All the more admirable then are the patience
and fortitude with which he faces the position.
Heroes there are in plenty, whose names shall
never mark the page of history; and if cheerful
courage, stern endurance, and unconqueiable
energy be elements of the heroic, then the busn-
man class in Australia may boast of numterless
representatives. Men whose lives are passed
under conditions of hard work and exposure to
every extreme of heat and cold, hunger and thirst,
must ntcassatiiy run exceptional risks of disease.

A Derangement of the Liver
THE CAUSE OF DISEASE
IN THIS
STOMACH,
KIDNEYS
—AND—
STSTEM.
Below will be found a brief summary of a Lecture upon the Liver, delivered before
the Electric College of Medicine, by
DR. J. HAYDOCK,
The Liver has been known as the great blood-maker and hlond-purifler of the Circulation. From
its size and spongy structure. It plays a most important part in the animal economy, as regards
assimilation and nutrition. Food taken in the mouth and acted upon by the digestive organs of the
stomach is converted Into Glucose and Peptone, and in these forms enters the Portal vein. Here, by
the action of the liver, these substances are converted into a form of sugar and pass out of the liver
by a large vein, called the Hepatic vein, Into the general circulation. The new material now termed
serves two purposes, viz ; the maintenance of heat in the body and assisting m the cell growth of the
system.
Dr. Murchison says. “ The composition of bile and its secretion is very complex. It is constantly
being secreted by the liver, and. increasing suddenly before eating, gradually decreases as soon as the
appetite is satisfied and feeding ceases.” Now, if this most important organ of the body becomes
torpid, or the passage of bile interfered with, emaciation and disease ensue. I note eight marked
peculiarities that now occur, and which we all know of
1. The patient complains of a feeling of weight and fullness of the stomach.
2. Distension of the bowels by wind.
3. Heartburn.
4. A feeling of weariness, pains in the limbs and great sleepiness after meals,
5. A bad taste in the mouth, especially in the morning, and furred tongue.
6. Constipation, with an occasional attack of diarrhoea.
7. Headache in front of head.
8. Depression of spirits and great melancholy, with lassitude and a disposition to leave
everything for to-morrow.
All of the above symptoms go to chow functional derangement of the liver; and now comes the
great importance of anv error made as to the condition of the patient. He should immediately pro-
vide himself with a LIVER STIMULANT, the most common form of which is a Pill. Daily ex-
perience shows that this, when the Pill is compounded properly, is the readiest mode of inciting and
promoting the action of the Liver, and can be almost always relied on. I have devoted many years of
my life, as many of you now before me know, to compounding a Pill that will act readily and system
aticaliy as a Bilious Remedy. Ido not believe in great purgatives, and therefore have made a Pill, one
of which is an active and thorough dose. I have called it
Or. Haddock’s Mew Liver Pill (Sugar Caafted.)
One Pill is a Dose! One Pill is a Dose! One Pill is a Dose!
For all Diseases of the Kidneys, Dr. Haydock’s New Liver Pills are a perfect cure,
will satisfy the most sceptical.

No wonder that legal luminary is wild!
Though he might be going circuit and bringing
off every persecuted Milesian in his district, he is
reduced to the necessity of sitting on a log in the
Burro wa electorate, and rehearsing his election
speeches before a goat.
The N.Z. Herald says in an editorial:—
“ If America has any pity or goodwill for Ireland,
it is because she inherited from our English an-
cestry that love of fair play which England herself
seems to have outgrown.” This is exactly what
dispassionate Australians say, too.
From a blundering attack on Sir Henry
Parkes in the Sydney Evening News “ Pre-
cedents are the first resource of minds wanting in
originality.” There is an epigrammatic force about
this statement which proves it to be the convincing
result of long personal experience.

As a rule, Sir Patrick J ennings is a liberal
encourager of the St. Oecillan art, hut some of
ouriprincipal hurdy-gurdy grinders declare to-day
that there are other and more desirable ways of
amassing wealth than by perching in front of the
n ew Premier’s door and blasting out the significant
air, “ Then you’ll re-member me.” Humour says
the O’Kelly is on the war-whoop once again, and
Sir Patsy’s chance of a wa'k-over is very slim

K“ Husb! hold that noise!” cried a Minister
elect (he thought so), tapping at the door of the
Ministerial room et the Sydney Reform Club, after
many vain attempts to turn.the handle; why,
they can hear this stamping and shouting down in
the street.” “ Oh. come in,” cried the member for
the Portals, laughing and spitting out a tooth;
“we are just sinking our little personal differ-
ences ’ before uniting for the ‘ good of our blessed
country.’ Come in.”
The Kiama Reporter is in a despondent
state over the political prospects of New South
Wales, it observes that if things do not mend,
“sooner or later we must find the bonds of society
loosened, ar d the result can only be anarchy, from

glad that we shall only have to face anarcny

“Tut tut, I, aw, can’t have that fellow in

From England we learn that Mr. Childers

Little Mirams, of Collingwood (Yio.),is a
Liberal. So are Tucker and Reid, of Fitzroy. Yet,
in one of his election speeches the other night, the
former said he “ was opposed to Sunday amuse-
ments, Sunday trading, and Sunday trains, and
the two latter expressed themselves very simi-
larlv. If Libera's of this description could have
all their own way, those members of the com-
munity who refused to spend their Sundays in
psalm-singing and sombre hypocrisy would have
the stocks and the pillory reserved for their
benefit.
Here are two news items published in a
single month:— 1 “The Queen has sent a donation
of£10 to the secretary of the Temporary Home for
Lost and Starving Dogs at Battersea. The
Queen has sent a donati >n of £500 to the secretary
of the b um? for the Relief ot tue Unemployed.
Thus we observe that Her Majesty rates a starving
man as high as 50 dogs-ouly tne e are five times
as many starving men as starving dogs in England.
Hence we calculate that Her Majesty rock ns one
starving dog to be worthylof as much relief as ten
starving men. At least, that seems the ratio of
her for each class of sufferer per
head. H« Majesty was always fond of dumb
animals.
There is grim humour iu this. The Vic-
torian Temperance Party nearly exhausted itself
to ihe last kick in a mad fight with the Licensed
Victuallers to get the Licensing Act passed. It
triumphed. One of the clauses it cherished most
was that affirming Local Option. Last week the
first petition under this clause was Presented to
the Government. It came from a district that
wanted another hotel 1 The Licensing Act pro-
vides that there shall be one licensed house for
every 350 of the first 1000 inhabitants. There is
pnfy y one puhllc-house in Maddmgley (the place
from which the petition comes), and there are
over 500 inhabitants. So that the first use made of
the hard-fought-for Local Option clause has been
to ask for more tanglefoot 1 It is the very gall and
wormwood of sarcasm.
The Victorian Working Men’s Political
Reform Association has a definite programme, of
which the heads are 1. Maintenance of the
S resent Education Act in its integrity; 3.
ationalisation of land; 3 National Bank of Issue
based on system of flat money; 4. Electoral re-
form, Inclusive of single electorates—abolition of
plural voting—extension of polling hours—forfei-
ture of members’ seats upon breach of election
pledges; 6. scheme of national irrigation; 6 Fed-
eration of Australasian colonies; 7. Strict State
neutrality on matters of religious conviction, in-
cluding Oaths Abolition Bill -Purely secular in-
struction in State schools; 8 Local election of
colonial governess; 9 Legalisation of the eight-
hours system of labour; 10. Opening of the Public
Library and Museum on aundays; 11 Financial
reform; 13. No State aided immigration; 13. Autl-
Chinese legislation. The N.S. W working men
have no association and no programmes, and con-
sequently are like a kingdom divided against
itself. Their influence is confined to helping on the
election of a tew individual members ot Parliament,
no two of whom agree about anything.
Those who read Sir Patrick Jennings’
speech in the N.S.W. Assembly on Thursday night,
must have certainly been impressed with one fact
—that the House all but crawled to the bon.
member. But it always has! However be does
it, Sir Patrick has acquired the art of over-bearing
bon. members to perfection. He does not need to
speak to do so either. A puff, a hoisting up of a chin
or two, a stony glance, and it is done. The result
is a happy one to himself. He may stand up and
make the moat self-sufficient and intolerable
speech ever heard, but throughout the delivery of
the string of dreary periods he is never subject to
Interruption. Indeed, singular to say, he is in-
variably greeted “ with signs of approbation ”
from all parts of the House, notwithstanding that
scores of members thirst at intervals with a desire
to open up the bon. gentleman with a blunt in-
strument. If divinity does hedge a king, cer-
tainly something of the kind is associated with the
bon. member for the Bogan. We cannot account
for it, unless, indeed, the reason of this koloo-lng
be discovered in the circumstance that Sir Patrick
is a Papal Knight of St. Gregory’s Powders.
Listen to Sir Patrick:—“l am not going
to bring the name of the Governor into this
debase more than is necessary. What I Informed
His Excellency I do not feel at liberty to intro-
duce except under extreme circumstances.”
Really, this kind of talk impresses us as being
" hollower” than poetry- Why, we ask, should
the hoo. gentleman “ bring the name of the
Governor into this debate more than is necessary ?
No one has accused the nobis Knight of any such
absurd intention; so whence this ridiculous dis-
claimer ? Then the Pride of the Bogan informs
the House (not a soul dreamt of asking him) that
he would not “introduce” something he told His
Excellency ‘‘except under extreme circum-
stances.” There was no possible reason why the
hon. member should not have let the House know
everything that passed between and
himself, but Sir Patrick was not to be denied the
smug pleasure of mentioning his conference with
Lord Carlngton, which, very likely, conjured up
an emaciated cheer from one or two crawlers,
anxious to catch the eye (no easy matter, hy-the-
way) of the Knightly orator.
Mr. Howard Spensley, M.P. for Finsbury
formerly Victorian Attorney-General —in the
Duffy Administration), has, it is cabled, given
notice of his intention to Introduce into the Com-
mons a Payment of Members’ Bill. Payment of
British members—at the hands of their consti-
tuents direct—already prevails to a not inconsider-
able extent. Such of the Parnellites as have in-
sufficient means for subsistence are supported out
of the Nationalist funds: and a good many English
members, nominees of the working classes, are
maintained by subscription among the electors.
With the spread of education has arrived a time
when the rich are deprived of their former mono-
poly of intelligence and their long-exercised pri-
vilege of making laws for the great body of the
people. The British democracy, which recognises
the right of the electors to pay their members il
they choose, will soon come to see that what is
now done by individuals should be done by the
State, and that the present system of representa-
tion under which the House of Commons is, in
many respects, an aristocratic club, and, in most
cases utterly inacessible, save to men of means
should he modified by means similar to those
adopted in a majority of theunodern democracies
A correspondent writing to on© of the
Melbourne papers puts the question of irrigation
in anew and somewhat surprising light. He says,
in effect, that the fertile three-fourths of the
colony are not likely to submit to be taxed to
make the other and arid fourth blossom like the
rose. Also, that tae present Premier—Duncan
Gillies-would not be so enchanted with the irriga-
tion schemes of Mr, Deakin only that he (the Pre-
mier) happens to be “ member for the dry area
known as Rodney.” Farther, that if this species
of taxation of the many for the good of the few
meets with the approval of Parliament it should
be adopted all round, and then “ the selectors ot
Gippsland will have their scrub cleared at the
public cost, the dwellers on poor land their soil
manured ditto, the ‘topers’ their liquor without
duty ditto, the ‘teetotallers’ their bohea and
mocha ditto’’-and so on. There is more In this
than meets the eye. But the correspondent gives
himself away in his concluding sentence. He says
that if these things come to pass he will not object
as he “will necessarily join some of the coteries
to be blessed so hugely and cheaply.” It does net
require a ghost from the other world to guess
what one he will join. It will not, we are free,to
bet, he the one that yearns for untaxed bohea and
moeha. He evidently sees no 'further use for
water than to mix it with something stronger.
The people of Victoria, for a business com-
munity, do not manage to get very much work
out of their Governor in exchange for £IO,OOO a
year and the free use of the gigantic pile of bricks
and mortar on the hanks of the Yarra, which is
called Government House. Sir Henry Loch, since
ho came to represent his Sovereign in Victoria,
has not lost his health through bard work. We
should like to have a tenth part of what he has
drawn for signing his name, for, besides affixing
his autograph to the bills of last session, which
was as heavy a piece ot business for the spectators
as for himself, we don’t know that he has done
anything. Does It not, therefore, seem a little too
much of the monkey when there is really an im-
portant piece of work to do, that half-a-dozen
Ministers must take a train journey and visit him
at his mountain home, at Mount Macedon, in order
to have the work executed ? They certainly went
out of town on a Saturday, which is a half-
holiday in the Government service, and Sir Benry
may have protested against attending at his office
in the Treasury building, Melbourne, in the after-
noon, while other public servants were enjoying
the sea breezes. Still, we think, Sir Henry might
have stretched a point on an Important occasion
when three Ministers ot the Crown required to be
sworn in, and not have given the said Ministers
and their colleagues a chance of making flunkeys
of themselves, by taking a six-hour journey in
order to save His (well paid) Excellency from put-
ting on his boo s.
Mr. Graham Berry unbent himself the
other night, and gave au address to the Melbourne
Debating Society. The address was of the “ keep •
your-eye-on-your-father ” order. If the young
men there assembled would only put their bluchers
In the exact footprints be had made upon the
sands of time and follow each other in Indian file
they might one day become even as great as he
was. The eloquent orator, however, had no right
to say that there was “no doubt the Victoria?!
boundary ought to be the Murrumbidgee.” The
fierce and fiery spirit that carried tho N.S.W. Con-
tingent through herds of goats and asses is not yet
dead. It is not even sleeping. The Government
has as much; as it can do to hold Dailey’s dare-
devils In leash. It was only a few nights ago that
a band of them made a desperate raid on
a Chinaman’s garden on the Botany-road, and
eturned triumphant with spAl of cucum s ers and
turks’ heads, not to mention radishes. And one
day last week one of the wickedest and most reck-
lessly daring of them, with a wild courage peculiar
to Dim, stopped a little girl in the street and drank
off at one gulp the quart of beer she was carrying
home for her father’s dinner, and then swaggered
away, humming an Arab air* So that it is ill
statesmanship to endeavour to stir up a feeling ox
animosity between the two countries in this
fashion. If our veterans were let loose upon Vic-
toria the inhabitants would know the tact to their
bitter cost. There would not be a pound of corned
beef or a pint of beer to be had in the whole
colony a month after the Contingent crossed the
Murray.
The once-celebrated C. E. Jones, ot
“ lamb and mint sauce ” and “ Bungaree Savages
celebrity, is once again a candidate tor the Vic-
torian Parliament and g it an enthusiastic recap-
tion from 4000 Ballarat electors the other night.
At the last general election he tied Pincham tor
the third sent, and the returning officer gave a
vote that seated Fincham. When the numbers go
up this time it is thought Jones will head the poll.
Jones’ star (ere he was expelled the Victorian
Parliament for alleged bribery) was once high
above the political horizon, and when he sat in the
Legislature he made things pretty lively. Those
were the days of Geonre Higiabotham, K 1).

spicuously even amongst such talent. We re
collect when C. E. was at dangora-drawn with g'
P. Smith, and the latter ran away from Supple
of the Akqus, whom he had injured. Supple in
order to be avenged on Barrister Smith, waited
for him in a Melbourne thoroughfare with a
loaded pistol, and Smith escaped, but a publican
named Walshe received the shot instead, and was
fatally iojured. After this event someone in the
House accused Q. P. Smith of cowardice. C. E
Jones determined to get a thrust into Smith’s
ribs, and arose to defend his adversary in this
fashion:—" It had pained him to hear the hon
member (Mr. G. P Smith) accused of cowardice’
That charge must be without foundation. Every
human being brought some share of courage with
him into this world, and no person had ever heard
of tbe hon. member for South Bourke using up
any portion of the original endowment. He must
therefore, have a great hoard of courage some
place.” The Speaker caUed “ order, order,” and-
- truculent Jones passed to anew phase of the
question.
No sooner had the gifted but very uncer-
tain Heydon decided to retire from political life
than aspirants in dozens cune forward for the
vacant seat. The verbose, 11 irid, and frothy
Colonha-Olose was first in the field, and next to
him J P. T- Caulfield, the Victorian word-piler
who imbibed Liberalism with his juvenile sop, and
began orating even while his first long trousers
bore evidence of the tribute his knees had paid to
‘‘big ring.” He comes forward with a platform
which pretty well “ kivers the whole ground,” and
includes everything, from the abolition of the
Upper House to ‘* the better protection of women
and children.” Whether this latter plank is only
a quaint device for the introduction of something
new in the way of corset ads., we are unable at
present to say; but anyhow, his programme
is an extensive one. The man who could
desire more reforms than the boy-politi-
cian is prepared to go bald-headed for
is a revolutionary glutton whose existence is
a menace to the entire constitution. Toese two
candidates alone should he able bet ween them to
supply enough hustings oratory to satisfy Yass
P alns for the remainder of tne present century.
B. R. Wise, the freetrader, has also announced his
desire to accept a permanent retainer from Yass
Plains, and has already drawn first blood la the
contest. Besides these the loquacious and egotisti-
cal W. P. Crick is in the vicinity, and Garden
Honey has, we hear, invested in anew pair of
bluchers, with the intention of starting to canvass
the district. But we have a strong idea that any-
one who wishes to sit for Fass Plains will have to
contest the electorate with the present member at
next general election. Prom the eccentricity of
Mr. Heydon’s political character,we are inclined to
accept the announcement of his intended resig-
nation as an earnest of his continuance in his pre-
seat position. At Yass they react the fervid ad-
dresses of coming patriots with an expansive
smile, and softly remark, “ These ’ere chaps don’t
know Loo ’eydun, as we does.”

THE GAY GOHANNA.
A CONTRIBUTION TO HIS UNNATURAL
HISTORY.
Who hath beheld the Australian Q ohann a
In his haunts ? Who bath seen him in his secret
fastnesses, and watched his coming and going, and
his general methods of business ? Behold, we have
found the manl He dwells lo gum-gloomed Gipps-
land, by the margin of Lake Tyers, and when he is
not chopping wood, writes bush articles for the
Uairnsdale Advertiser. He seems to be a happy
contented sort of fellow, too, for he begins the
article from which we are about to quote with the
words:—“Persons who live in towns and are
accustomed to see numbers of persons every day,
may think that residence in these back-blocks is
dull life. But it is not so.” Then he goes on to
describe the amusement to be obtained from
watching the habits of birds. He strongly reminds
Us In this of Mark Twain’s story of Jim Baker and
his joys. Jim Baker was a true, though a rude,
naturalist—a much truer one than those so-called
who go rampaging around the world with guns in
their bands, shooting everything that runs, or
creeps, or Alee, in order to stuff them for a museum
—truer, because he loved them too well to harm
them. Such another is our friend at Lake Tyers.
We commend the following observations on the
sagacity of the gohaana to the attention of
naturalists.
* * *
*‘l have,” he begins, “been much in-
terested in watching the habits of iguanas he
uses the dictionary spelling here—which we scorn
—ln order, we presume, not to offend the delicate
taste of the purists of Bairnsdale, nut gohanna is the
pronunciation all over the bush, and gohanna we
shall continue to write, if all the lexicographers in
the world should go mad over it. " Many persons
call them hideous, ugly-looklng things, but they
do good service in the bush bv killing snakes and
Other noxious vermin. Sometimes a lot of them
come round my place; I am glad to see them, for
they act as scavengers and eat up all the refuse.
They are very fond of bones, and I have seen them
many a time trying to swallow the back-bone and
ribs of a fish that they could hardly get into their
mouth. They would knock it on the ground,
hammer it against the hut, and by some means get
It into their throat. Then would come the tug of
war - how to swallow it. They would rear up on
their hind legs against the nut and rub their
chests against the bark until they gradually got
the bone swallowed, and were soon on a sharp
look-out for more.”
* • •
Evidently the Gohanna must be admitted
Into the ranks of the animals of higher Intellect
after this. Your snake is an imbecile compared to
him, for your snake takes days to swallow any-
thing too big for his throat, and lies for days
afterwards In a state of bloated torpor. We refer
now to your snakes of the larger size. Your
frohanna, however, has, ages ago, mastered his
esson in mechanics. Our naturalist now gives an
Interesting instance of this.
• * *
“ One day I threw out a ham-bone, in which
they quickly took great interest, but it was too
big for them, they could not swallow it. At last
an enterprising young fellow got the knuckle end
In his mouth and by dint of hammering on the
ground It went down so far and stuck, refused to
go further. Nothing daunted, this genius (for
undoubtedly he was one) studied how to get that
bone further; before him lay a large log, and
whether he had heard of battering rams
or not I can’t say, but the log seemed
to suggest to him the idea of ene, for
he carefully straightened the bone in his
mouth and made a rush at the log, but no use, the
bone canted over to one side and would not go
down. Try again, says ho, so drawing back for a
food run, and fixing the bone square in his mouth,
e made another rush full butt at the log; all in
vain, the bone was too large, so he put it down in
despair. Another one, much larger than his com-
panion, who must have been watching his unsuc-
cessful efforts, now took the matter in hand, or,
rather, mouth. He got the bone well set in his
Jaws, and, without losing time or wasting strength
made a straight run at the log, but he missed his
aim and only knocked the bone to one side. One
failure would not make him give in, so after con-
siderable settling of the bone in his mouth he
made a tremendous rush at the log, and by fair
engineering skill sent the bone down his throat,
to nis evident satisfaction.”
* * *
What do you think of that, Messieurs the
Museum Naturalists? Our friend does not say
Whether gohannas are ever subject to Indigestion,
but after the publicity we have given his observa-
tions we shall expect to hear of an irruption of
liver-pill and laxative-mixture agents in Glpps-
land before long. He concludes by saying that he
considers gohannas ought to be protected by law.
So they should if they are all as sagacious as those
on Lake Tyers. In fact, not only that, but we
think they ought to be placed in the position to
make law. We would gladly welcome a Govern-
ment Ministry of Gohannas in N a.W. just now-
even if the Premier had to be a Paddymelon.
A las! for Valentine.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The practice of sending Valentines ap-
pears to be dying out in-Melbourne. This year the
number that passed through the post-office was
less by half than that of last year.” We clip the
disgusting par. from a newspaper and drop sor-
rowful tears into the paste-pot. Think, dear
readers, of the Melbourne girls rising at 6 in the
morning to watch for the postman, and being
rewarded for their patience with nothing but an
ugly one.” Their poor little hearts must be well
n }£h P/°ken. Wethinks—new word—we hear the
plaintive song of
The Melbourne Maid to Cupid.
-To® of Romance it Is over,
The spirit of chivalry’s fled,
lathe breast of the latter-day lover
All sentiment seems to be dead;
™ easure girls’ charms by their purses
And- how has this change come about?
Guitars, pretty bon-bons, and verses
And Valentines—all are “gone out.”
Time was when young Romeo panted
the maid of his fancy to toast:
He deemed her a fairy enchanted,
And sent her nice presents by post;
But now his best girl is a “filly,”
Romantic old customs he’ll flout.
And (excuse us for weeping, ’tis silly)
Even Valentine's Day is “gone out.”
Alas I for the lovers departed,
Who ever were anxious to please.
Were courteous, kind, and soft-hearted,
And often went down on their knees:
Wrote odes to their mistress’s eyebrow,
In language high-flown and devout—
We can’t but admit, with a sigh, now,
That fellows like them.have died out.
Girls read of the “ seul-stirring whisper”;
ouch whispers we now never hear,
Eor the words of the modern limp lisper
Discordantly fall on the ear;
We’re told of the fond, furtive glances
Awaked by our grandmother’s pout—
Men’s manners at theatres and dances
Are altered—Romance is “gone out.”
They stick their red hands in their pockets
And eye us with scornful contempt,
Nor beg locks of hair for their lockets,
Like lovers of whom we have dreamt;
For jewels and trinkets in caskets
In vain do we artfully tout—
Even scent-bottles, fixed up in baskets.
On Valentine’s Day, are “gone out.”
Dear Cupid, sweet offspring of Venus I
We need all thy amorous aid;
There is sympathy ever between us—
Thou rulest each thought of a maid;
leach men, yet again, the grande passion:
Renew, now, dead Sentiment s birth:
Bring Valentines once more in fashion
And reign, as of yore, upon earth.

THERE are many men in this colony who are,
day by day, melancholy, miserable, and a
burden to themselves, through early indiscretion
or over-indulgence. It is to those that this adver-
tisement is addressed. Impotence drags its victim
in its unhappy train through years of suffering,
rendering bin existence a misery. He sees his
fellow beings hale, hearty, and vigorous—in the
full enjoyment of manhood’s greatest privilege—
and naturally becomes despondent, seeking soli-
tariness, and shunning society generally.
He is lured into trying some of the So-called
Remedies, but without avail, and imagines he
must go down to the grave a hopeless invalid. If
such be your calamity, know that your case can
be relieved and a Cure effected by a simple course
of this invaluable Medicine, which will, in the
short space of Four Weeks, reader you capable
of appreciating and Fnloying Life.
This valuable remedy affords relief, and perma-
nently cures all who suffer from Wasting and
Withering of the Nervous and Muscular Tissues,
Spermatorrhoea, and all Urinary Deposits, which
cause incapacity and degeneracy, total and partial
prostration, ana every other exhaustive derange-
ment of the system—regenerating all the im-
portant elements of the human frame, and en-
abling man to fulfil bis most sacred obligations.
The directions are very simple, and require no
restraint or hindrance from business. Pamphlets

AYER’S PILLS
A large proportion of the diseases which
cause human suffering result from derange-
ment of the stomach, howels, and liver.
Ayer’s Cathartic Pills act directly upon
these organs, and are especially designed to
cure the diseases caused hy their derange-
ment, including Constipation, Indiges-
tion, Dyspepsia, Headache, Dysentery,
and a host of other ailments, for all of
which they are a safe, sure, prompt, and
pleasant remedy. The extensive use of these
Pills hy eminent physicians in regular prac-
tice, shows unmistakably the estimation in
which they are held by the medical profes-
sion.
These Pills are compounded of vegetable
substances only, and are absolutely free from
calomel or any other injurious ingredient.
A Sufferer from Headache writes J
“Ayer’s Pills are invaluable tome, and
are my constant companion. I have been
a severe sufferer from Headache, and your
Pills are the only thing I could look to
for relief. One dose will quickly move my
bowels and free my head from pain. They
are the most effective and the easiest physic
I have ever found. It is a pleasure to roe to
speak in their praise, and I always do so
when occasion offers.
W. L. Page, of W. L. Page & Pro,”
Franklin St., Richmond,Va., June 3,1882.
“I have used Ayer’s Pills in number-
less instances as recommended by you, and
have never known them to fail to accomplish
the desired result. We constantly keep them
on hand at our home, and prize them as a
pleasant, safe, and reliable family medicine.
FOR DYSPEPSIA they are invaluable.
J. T. Hayes.”
Mexia, Texas, June 17,1882.
The Rev. Francis B, Harlowe, writing
from Atlanta, Ga., says: “For some years
past I have been subject to constipation,
from which, in spite of the use of medi-
cines of various kinds, I suffered increasing
inconvenience, until some months ago I
began taking Ayer’s Pills. They have
entirely corrected the costive habit, and
have vastly improved my general health,”
Ayer’s Cathartic Pills correct irregu-
larities of the bowels, stimulate the appe-
tite and digestion, and by their prompt and
thorough action give tone and vigor to the
whole physical economy.

HEALTH WITHOtJT MEDICINE.
Is obtained speedily and permanently by adopting
the safe and never- failing remedy of the new mode
of treatment by Electricity, as supplied to the
human system by wearing the MAGNETICAL
ELECT HIC APPLIANCE CO.’S genuine ELEC-
TRIC BELT, a restorer of impaired vitality and
failing health. It Is an unvarying success in the
cure and alleviation of Rheumatism, Indigestion,
Lumbago, Sciatica, Paralysis, Epilepsy, Constipa-
tion, Nervous Debility, and the numerous ailments
consequent upon living in a semi-tropical climate,
and the baneful effects of malaria, which alone
are caused by the deficiency or abstraction from
the body of the all-pervading element of life-
electricity. This mode of treatment is by far the
most perfect and successful method yet discovered
(combined with perfect safety) for supplying to the
body the continuous or imperceptible current of
electricity, without the aid of chain bands or use
of acid, thus giving no inconvenience to the
wearer. They are charged ready for use, and re-
tain their full power for a considerable period.
But to avoid any disappointment by their possible
loss of electric power, and to keep the appliances
up to their original strength, we undertake to re-
charge any of our appliances at the expiration of
twelve months, free of cost. One of the special
features of this treatment is the electric corset,
which is unsurpassed by its curative properties IQ
all female complaints, and is of superior shape and
manufacture. Price, 10s. and 15s.
GENT’S ELECTRIC BELTS are manufactured
expressly for tropical climates, of superior mate-
rial, in the shape of a riding belt, and are very
durable. Price, 155.; special power, 30s. In order-
ing size of waist outside first garment is required.
If mailed, 3s. extra. Lung Invigorators for the
successful treatment of all lung complaints,
hitherto without the domain of Electric Agency,
price 30s. All who have a tendency to weak lungs
should adopt this treatment before it is too late.
The appliances are adapted for locales well as con-
stitutional treatment in the form of Knee Caps,

invaluable for cold feet, defective circulation,

the adoption of this mode of treatment has in-
duced other people to attempt, by so-called cau-
tions and notices, to mislead the public. Therefor*

Carnrick’s Cod Liver Oil &Milk
PEPTONISED (DIGESTED.)
Highly recommended by the Medical Profession throughout the world as being
the best remedy for Coughs, Colds, Bronchitis, Scrofula, Wasting-
Diseases, Consumption, General Debility, over-taxed brains, &c., &o.
It will produce an immediate gain in flesh and strength.
Can be taken when all other forms of Cod Liver Oil are refused.
It contains about equal parts of the best Norwegian Cod Liver Oil and chfifiefi*
trated fresh milk, both peptonised (digested).
The peptonised milk disguises the unpleasant taste and smell of the oil. and
makes it as sweet as cream; very palatable and most nourishing.
Invaluable for children, and will agree with the most delicate persons, causing
no return or unpleasantness.
One trial Will satisfy anyone of the great value of this new and unique pre-
paration.
The reconstructive or nutritive properties are five times greatbr than the
plain oil or any other Emulsion, hence it is much cheaper.
Both the Oil and the Milk being digested, the whole will assimilate, whereas
in Cod Liver Oil and other Emulsions (being undigested) only a small
proportion is of any value. It is the most nerfect Emulsion evar
made, and the only one of digested Cod Liver Oil and Milk.
Analysed and recommended by the first Professors in Europe.
We also manufacture the above preparation combined with Hypophosphitea
of Lime and Soda. SOLD BY ALL CHEMISTS.

Important to Mothers Morses
Carnrick’s Soluble Food for Infants, Invalids*
and Aged Persons, is the.most nutritious, palatable, and easily-digested Infant’s
Food ever manufactured, containing fifty per cent, of the solids of milk (digested),
and fifty per cent, of the finest wheat, converted into soluble form.
A most perfect food. The nearest approach to Mother’s Milk ever made.
It is unequalled for the formation of fat, flesh, and bone, and increasing
the vital forces SO necessary to health.
Specially recommended in cases of Marasmus, Diarrhoea, and Cholera
Infantum, and where the digestion is defective.
Children fed upon cereals or cow’s milk alone very often remain weak, and
suffer from softening of the bones, and when attacked by infantile dis-
orders are unable to resist the inroads of disease.
“CARNRICK’S SOLUBLE FOOD” is invaluable for Invalids
and Aged Persons (who cannot digest farinaceous food), as it is rich
in nutritive and easily-digested albumenoids, thus increasing both flesh
and strength, and restoring the vital forces.
It is most convenient for use,being in a powdered form, and will keep indefinitely.
When boiled and stirred for three minutes it is ready for immediate use,

General Thayer’s Dirigible Balloons.
The working models of Dirigible Balloons, in-
vented by General Thayer, of which we give illus-
trations with this issue, promise to work a revolu-
tion in modern warfare, and to be the crowning
triumph of that annihilation of time and space
which has been the particular feature of the 19th
century. The balloons are of two kinds. The In-
dependent Dirigible obtains its ascending force
by means of hydrogen, and is propelled by two
motors. One of these is a high-speed air com-
pressor, coupled with a specially-adapted carbonic
acid gaa engine. Air is forced into a reservoir
until sufficient pressure is obtained, and then

released at regular periods, a forward energy re-
sulting from each discharge. The other motor
consists of a powerful wheel, which continuously
discharges air through a nozzle at the rear of the
air-ship, with powerful propelling force. If a
hollow truncated cane be placed over the nozzle,
the discharge of the blast draws in outside air
through the annular opening, and by imparting
velocity to it Increases the volume of the dis-
charge, and decreases its velocity. The use of
several such conical tubes, one outside the other,
as shown in Figure 1, considerably increases the
efficiency of the motor. In experiments with
water, the addition of live cones to the discharge
tube gave an increase of 50 per cent. The
nozzle can be moved in any direction, and thus
the steering is managed without the aid of any
rudder. The buoyant part of the balloon Is made
of tissues of strong silk and broad rubber-band.
A speed of 25 to 30 miles an hour is claimed for
this air-ship. In war, it Is claimed on behalf of
the Independent that by means of dynamite-bombs
and other explosives, it could lay a hostile country
under contribution, and destroy whole cities,
while, itself, safe from attack, and in times of
peace would afford a safe and exceedingly rapid
means of transit, general Thayer’s second
model, the Dependent dirigible balloon, is
directed by two wires on light cable, supported
by poles with U-shaped arms on their tops.
In shape, jt is similar to the Independent
but is propelled by electricity generated at the
end of the line and transmitted to a dynamo
machine on the deck of the balloon through
wheels. This air-ship is said to have a speed of 60
to 10 miles an hour in ordinary weather, and to be
capable of use in countries too rough for railways,
and the inventor calculates the cost of laying the
lines at about £3OO per mile. The models are now
under consideration by the British War Office, and
the result of the trials is anxiously awaited.
A Monstrous Massacre.
One of the most shocking cases of barbarous
treachery and ingratitude we have ever heard of
occurred in South Australia the other day. The
story comes to us by letter from one of the sur-
vivors. A whole community, after tendering hos-
pitality to a distinguished Government official, were
ruthlessly poisoned by order of the same! The worst
days of the Borgias offer nothing fiendish enough to
parallel this case. We will name the culprit, and
let him prosecute us if he dare. In a matter of
this sort it would be criminal to be silent. But
let our correspondent tell the ghastly tale in fits
own words. He says:—“The whole community
was astir making preparations for the re-
ception of the great man. A number of
the most influential members formed them-
selves into a committee to present him with
an address. It was tot expected be would
accept a banquet but a store of provisions had
been laid in to make sure. Pickets were placed
on the road to give notice of his approach and
there was talk of erecting a triumphal arch, but
the difficulties of the ground and our Inexperience
in the construction of such things, prevented this
proposition from being put into practice, Alter
several delays the great man arrived, and on*
naost respected citizen stood forth to read
address to him. It was couched in the Vo
reverential terms, though it contained some com
Plaints about the molestations we have suffered'
lately and asked lor a redress of grievances ordv
too well known to him. Would vou believe it y
instead of listening to the address, the haughty visi
tor actually threw a stone at the speaker which hn
him on the head and stunned him The next dav nil
my kindred were poisoned. lam the sole survivor
The person who caused them to be poisoned was
the Commissioner of Crown Lands.” There is th«
whole story, and a black and abominable storv it
is. If there is justice ia the land, the person named
should be made to feel it. We ;are too’, sick with
horror to write any more on the subject.
[P.S.—We have just discovered in time that the
writer of the letter we received waa a Jack-Rabbit.
We overlooked the signature at first. The 8.
Australian Commissioner of Crown Lands has
begun a tour of inspection of the rabbit camps in
that colony. We trust the commissioner will
think none the worse of us for our somewhat
strong language. If we had noticed the signature
at first we should have written in a different
strain. These little mistakes frequently occur in
newspaper offices.— Ed. B.]
