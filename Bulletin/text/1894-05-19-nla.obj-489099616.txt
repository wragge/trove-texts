“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonparell
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis-
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
Anew Parliamentary System-one House to
■ be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility. ’
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless news paper- ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen mbre or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular ■ newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress; it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with, any, other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

Supplies all the elements necessary for the com-
plete growth and nourishment of the Human
Frame.
A Complete Diet in Itself-
Requiring simply the addition of water to make

Renders valuable assistance in Wasting Fever.
Beneficial as a diet in severe cases of Typhoid.
Invaluable in Cholera Infantum.
Professor Sidney Ringer, of the University College,

for delicate children.
Extract from Prof. Ziemssen’s “ Cyclopaedia o*
the Practice of Medicine” :
ON CHOLERA INFANTUM.—YoI. YII.
“Regulation of the diet constitutes, in fact, the
principal method of treatment for Sporadic
Cholera, and particularly Cholera Infantum.
When the mother’s milk is insufficient, Nestle’s
Food is alone to be recommended.”—Pro. Wm. O.
Lecbe.
On TREATMENT of RACHITIS.-Yol. XVI.
“ In the treatment of rachitis, improper feeding
stands foremost among the causes of those gastro-
intestinal disorders which are so dangerous in
infant life. I recommend Nestle’s Infant Food
from personal experience of its value and con-
venience.”—Prof. Senator.
On SCROFULOSIS.—YoI. XVI.
“ What form of artificial feeding ought to be
selected ? The results of our own experience may
be briefly stated to be in favour of Nestle’s Food,
the use of which was but rarely attended with
indigestion, while the nutrition of the child im-
proved in the most gratifying manner.” —Prof.
Birch-Hiesohfeld.
It is recommended hy the highest Medical
Authorities throughout the World.

Professor TODD, Anderson’s College Medical
School, Glasgow, in an entirely voluntary com-
munication on his part to Messrs. Bosisto & Co.,
writes: —
It is lighter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
I have hitherto used, besides being free from the heavy
nauseous odour characteristic of others.
This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed
into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally, which places
it above other preparations,and considerably enhances its
value.

INDIGESTION
And Liver Complaint
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mr. T. J. CLUNE,
of Walkerville, S. Australia, writes t
"Six years ago, I had an attack of Indiges-
tion and Liver Complaint that lasted for
weeks; I was unable to do any hard work,
had no appetite, food distressed me, and I
suffered much from headache. My skin was
sallow and sleep did not refresh me. I tried
several remedies and consulted a doctor,
without obtaining any relief; Anally, one of
my customers recommended Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla; it helped me from the Arst,—in fact,
after taking six bottles I was completely
cured, and could eat anything and sleep
like a child.” *

A sect, of devil-worshippers, it is cabled,
has been unearthed in Paris. Devil-worship is a
harmless fad, anyway; it does no harm to the
worshippers, and it does no harm to the devil.
Moreover, it is more logical than appears on the
surface. Devil-worship is practically an appeal
to an alleged influence with a tail to move out of
the way; ordinary worship is an appeal to some
other agency to move him out of the way. The
simple motto of the devil-worshippers is, “Prin-
cipals only dealt with.”
Melbourne Evening Standard has reduced
itself to half its former size. This indeed is
reductio ad ahsurdum. But, seriously, the eight-
page mania is what has slain or beggared so many
dailies —doomed them to eternally scratch gravel
and pull the devil by the tail for a living. Half the
daily papers now published in Australia are run
on the theory that what the public wants is
stomach, not brains—fat, not muscle. A brilliant
four-page newsy broadsheet written with a bowie
knife by men with strong wrists, who worshipped
condensation and hated conventionalism of all sorts,
could cut the very soul out of the eight-page penny
paper, which has to go down on its knees every
day and humbly lick the feet of the big adver-
tiser.
Dear Bulletin, The coloured - labour
problem is being solved. In the Richmond River
sugar-cane biz. the Caucasian will soon be starved
out by the Hindoo. About a hundred nigs., “our
fellow subjects,” have leased farms here, and it is
reported that 300 more are on the way. These
darkies have actually been letting contracts to the
white trash for brushing and felling scrub at prices
undreamt of before their advent. For instance,
brushing and felling : ordinary price, 355. to 40s.
per acre ; Hindoo price, 15s. to 17s. 6d. A good
axeman will “ put through ” about an acre a week
if he works early and late. Cane-trashing:
ordinary price, 30s. an acre (I never got it done
for less till this season) ; Hindoo price, 15s. to
17s. 6d. The greatest part of this work, in one
section of this district, is now done by Hindoos.
For breakfast each man has a cupful of rice; for
“dinner,” a scone without butter, jam, beef or
tea; for supper, a stalk of sugar-cane. Should
this immigration not be stopped soon there will
be no room on the Richmond for white men at all.
As it is, there are scores of able-bodied whites
looking for employment and being turned away to
make room for “ Indians.”— Cobnstalk, Wyallah,
April 26, 1893.

Australians study not human-nature—but
only horse-nature. Up to the last week no witness
in the Barraba bank-murder inquest was positive
that the prisoners were the men seen riding out of
town after the murder. They only “thought”so.
Yet everyone of them could describe the mur-
derers’ horses minutely, and could pick them out,
from any number, without the slightest hesitation.
Apropos, in the early days of Charters Towers a
successful digger wanted to get away, and a friend
offered to lend him a horse he had running in
B ’s paddock. The digger, Bill Smith (that
wasn’t his- name, but it will serve) went to the
paddock with a properly-signed order describing
the horse. The man in charge was too ill to go
out. “You’ll find the horse in a pocket of the
creek,” he said, describing the place. Bill went,
and found a horse exactly answering the descrip-
tion of the one he was to take, caught and saddled
him, and started for Cleveland Bay, As he rode off
someone called to him he had better “ take that
horse back, ” and got a rude answer. On arrival
at Townsville, Bill was pounced on for horse-
stealing, and committed for trial. When the case
came before the jury it turned out that he had
actually got the wrong horse, but one so like the
animal he ought to have taken—colour, markings,
brands, and all—that the respective owners could
not distinguish them apart, though when they
were carefully compared side by side there were
certain minute differences to be detected.

SATURDAY, MAY 19, 1894.
A “Leading Paper.”
A few days ago three New South Wales
Judges sat to consider a charge of “ con-
tempt of court,” a peculiarly hazy and ill-
defined offence, which has no recognised
limits, but is extended or contracted very
much at the option of the Bench. There was
a lengthy hearing, followed by a learnedly
nebulous judgment which, in some respects,
left the subject a trifle more hazy than before.
The case in regard to which the contempt
arose was that of Crossley v. the Commer-
cial Banking Co. of Sydney. According to
New South Wales law, any bank officials
guilty of making false returns are sub-
ject to certain heavy penalties, which
penalties may be recovered by the informer.
Crossley, in the capacity of informer,
charged the aforesaid institution with pub-
lishing false returns, and while the case was
still pending the Sydney Morning Herald
took upon itself to prejudge the case on
behalf of the Commercial Banking Co. The
paragraphs complained of were as follows :
(1) The proceedings being taken against one or more of
our banks referred to elsewhere are based on the old
criticism that the banks are not justified in inserting
among their assets the amounts due from the branches of
their own banks. The Government Statist has taken that
view of the case. The bank concerned defends its own
presentation of the returns. Obviously, therefore, the
point involved is one mainly of form, in nosense involving
the stability of the bank or banks. (2) Bank returns. —
It is reported-that writs have been issued against officers
of one of the banking companies of Sydney and also
against the bank for the recovery of large amounts on the
alleged groqnd that returns had been prepared in regard
to the transactions of the bank which were inaccurate.
The bank hfs, it is understood, instructed its solicitors to
defend the lf is believed that the writs have
been issued on some technical point. So far as the bank
is concerned, it is said that the returns which it had pre-
pared were in accordance with forms which have been in
use for the last 30 years. The bank has no doubt that it
will be able to prove unmistakably that the figures em-
braced in the returns referred to are absolutely correct.
The writs have been served at the instance of a private
individual. To a representative of the S.M. Herald who
waited upon the Premier last evening, Sir George said
that he had carefully gone through the accounts of the
bank referred to, and also those of another bank (which
was mentioned to him), and he found that they were per-
fectly correct.
# * *
One of the few things that is definitely
known about the law of “ contempt ” is that
it absolutely prohibits the publication of any
statements which are calculated to influence
the Bench or the jury in its decision upon a
case then pending. In this instance the
Herald, in the first place, took upon
itself to announce that the charge, even if
proved, “ in no way involved the stability of
the bank ” —in other words, that it was
trivial and purely formal. This was obviously
a question for the law to decide ; if the
practice alleged really existed it was quite
possible that it would affect the stability of
the bank very considerably. The matter
was one, in fact, which depended mainly
on whether the discrepancy, if it existed,
was accidental or otherwise. And, in
the second place, the Herald announced
that Premier Dibbs (brother of the Com-
mercial Bank’s general manager) was pre-
pared to guarantee that the accounts were
perfectly correct, that there was no dis-
crepancy at all, and that, in effect, the case
ought to be decided in favour of the bank.
This was obviously an unjustifiable inter-
ference on the part of Premier Bibbs, who
had no earthly right to constitute himself a
court and acquit his brother’s bank on his
own responsibility; and it was also an
unjustifiable interference on the part of the
paper which published his unsupported
assertions. The decision of the three
Judges, however, was to the effect that,
though a contempt had been committed, it
was so small that it really didn’t matter,
therefore they merely ordered the Herald
to pay costs. Also, they expressed their
deep regret at having to do even this, the
causes of this regret being apparently as
follows: (1) The plaintiff was a “common
informer (2) his proceedings were “ haras-
sing;” (3) the Herald was “the leading
paper of the colony ; ” (4) the contempt
was really “commendable;” and (5) the
items objected to were published for the
entirely praiseworthy object of “allaying
the distrust which existed in the public
mind.” Also, the three Judges went out of
their way to state, as solemnly as they knew
how, that though the Herald was guilty of
contempt they would gladly make the other
party pay his own costs if it were possible to
do so—which it wasn't.
# * *
The unconscious bias of the Court in the
interests of Property sticks out conspicuously
in this deliverance. Crossley, undoubtedly,
was an “informer ;” his commonness is a
mere matter of opinion. At all events, the
banking law offers special and extraordinary
inducements to the informer, and if he is
common then the statute is responsible.
Also, the allegation that Crossley’s pro-
ceedings were “harassing” was another un-
called-for jibe ; certain modes of procedure
are laid down by the law, and as Crossley
followed them, in this case also the law is
responsible. As for the statement that the
Herald is “ the leading paper of the colony,”
it was an absolutely gratuitous advertisement
for the defendant, and an utterly irrelevant
absurdity as well. The Herald doesn’t lead
public opinion, for it seldom expresses any defi-
nite opinions of its own. It has by no means
the largest circulation in the province. And
is not a recognised authority on anything
in particular. There was no evidence before
the Court as to what constituted a “ leading
paper ” and there was nothing in the statute
dealing with the subject ; and whether the
Herald was a leading paper or not had no
possible bearing on the case, for the law
simply forbids the publication of a certain
class of statements, and draws no distinction
between the leading paper of the metropolis
and the tenth-rate journal which ekes out a
precarious existence in a far Western hovel,
Therefore, when the Court broke in upon
the solemnity of its proceedings to “barrack”
for the defendant on a matter so far apart
from the question at issue it made itself
just as foolish as if it had burst forth
with the statement that Beecham’s pills are
well worth a guinea a box. Also, its utterly
irrelevant private opinion would have been
quite as valuable in one case as in the other.
• * •
Further, the Court’s distinct implication
that the fact of the Herald being, in its
own unsupported and utterly useless private
opinion, a “leading paper,” was, in some
way or other, an alleviation of its offence,
reads like an amazing example of personal
bias. It is just as absurd as the assumption
that if a man is killed by a “leading
citizen ” the offence is not so bad, or the
corpse is not quite so dead, as if the defendant
hadn't been a leading citizen. Moreover,
the Court’s proceeding was a most unusual
departure from the ordinary cast-iron judicial
etiquette. As a rule, the Bench professes to
be blindly ignorant of everything outside the
law and the evidence. It flatly refuses to
understand what a racing “ consultation ” is
unless the matter is fully explained on oath ;
and it doesn’t know what the Melbourne Cup
means until it is enlightened by reliable
testimony. In the ordinary course of events
it wouldn’t even have known, on its own
private account, that there was any S.M.
Herald at all ; and when it rose up and
knew so violently, on its own personal
responsibility, all about the lofty character
of the defendants, that lofty character not
being in evidence, the public impression
is apt to be that the sympathies of the Court
are too plainly with the rich and privileged
and solemnly-respectable transgressor.
# * •
When the Court travelled out of its way
again to declare that the Herald’s state-
ments were made with the entirely pure,
noble, and disinterested object of allaying
panic, it did much to strengthen this un-
pleasant impression. This statement was
also absurd and unwarrantable, for no man
knows, or can know for an absolute certainty,
what any other man’s object really is. More-
over, even if the Court had known the
defendant’s object—if it had lighted him up
inwardly with the electric-light, and had
seen his noble motive among his vitals—the
theory that there is anything specially com-
mendable about the act of “allayingdistrust”
is a gruesome absurdity. It. all depends
upon the surrounding circumstances. If
the distrust is ill-founded, it should be
allayed in the public interest ; if it
is well-founded, it should be encour-
aged, also in the public interest ; if
there is no evidence either way, and the
matter is awaiting judicial settlement, then
it should be severely left alone. In the
present case, the question as to whether
there was or was not any ground for distrust
was still awaiting settlement ; therefore, the
three Judges could not possibly know
whether the distrust should be “ allayed ” or
not. Apparently, however, they travelled
on three preconceived ideas : (1) All banks
are necessarily sound ; (2) consequently, it
is the duty of the public to view them with
blind confidence under all circumstances;
and (3) any “right-thinking” paper which
breaks the law in its efforts to promote this
blind confidence is, therefore, doing a noble
and commendable action. The one-sided
irrelevance of this plea was further accen-
tuated by the fact that, so far as the Com-
mercial Banking Co. was concerned, there
was no distrust to allay, and, therefore, the
Herald’s action was a gratuitous interfer-
ence. Hardly anybody, so far as appeared
on the surface, had heard of Crossley’s
action or took any interest in it. There was
no run on the bank. It was always
viewed by the people of N.S. W. with
a profound confidence which even its recon-
struction hardly affected. Its business was
steadily increasing, and its shares were rising
in the market—and, in short, the Herald’s
interference was a mere outburst of its own
private sympathies with the interests of Pro-
perty, for which outburst there was no sub-
stantial cause whatever.
* # *
The situation can best be understood by
turning the case upside-down. If the
Herald, instead of publishing the unsup-
ported opinion of the defendant’s brother,
had published that of the plaintiff’s brother,
—the brother of the “common informer ; ”
if, instead of stating that the defendant was
undoubtedly right and that the bank’s
accounts were perfectly correct, it had
announced that the plaintiff was undoubtedly
right, and that the bank’s accounts were
hopelessly inaccurate ; if, instead of breaking
the law for the noble purpose of allaying
public distrust in a bank which it believed to
be sound, it had broken it for the equally
noble purpose of preventing the public put-
ting a blind and disastrous confidence in a
bank which it believed to be rotten—what
would have happened ? If the Hard Cash
cases are any criterion, that kind of com-
mendable purpose on the part of the “lead-
ing paper” would have resulted in nine
months’ gaol at the very lowest estimate.
Also, in that case, the Herald would have
been degraded there and then from its posi-
tion as a “leading paper,” for no leading
paper ever takes such a view of things.
* « *
However bad the Herald’s contempt of
court might be, it wasn’t so bad as the court’s
contempt of itself and of every principle of
justice. When it so effusively commended
the paper’s efforts to “allay distrust,” it
distinctly implied that the distrust was of a
kind which should be allayed—in other
words, that it was entirely unfounded, for
not even a judge could venture to maintain
that a well-grounded distrust should be
“allayed.” It would be as reasonable to
commend the individual who allayed the
suspicions of a man in the top-floor of a
burning building, and then left him there.
Consequently the Court’s attitude all through
v/as almost a tacit declaration that Crosslby’s
yet-untried case rested on no evidence what-
ever. And this attitude was a public mis-
fortune, for it is essential that the adminis-
tration of justice should not only he pure and
unbiassed, but should also look pure and un-
biassed, and some of the recent doings of
N.S. W. Supreme Court have been extremely
unfortunate in this respect. Only a few
months ago, when a jury awarded a certain
sum as compensation to a little girl who had
been badly mutilated and crippled for life,
the Court, under threat of ordering a new
trial and thereby involving the plaintiff’s
guardians in a ruinous expense, practically
compelled them to forego half the award.
Its openly-admitted reason for this astonish-
ing procedure was that one-half the award
was sufficient “considering the child’s station
in life ” —in other words, that the torture,
maiming, and permanent disfigurement of an
obscure person’s daughter only mattered half
as much, simply because she was an obscure
person’s daughter, as a similar injury to the
offspring of richer parents. In the Herald’s
case the situation was reversed, and the feeling
allusions to that journal’s alleged position as
a “leading paper ” will undoubtedly create
an impression that it got off with the lightest
possible penalty mainly because of that posi-
tion, and that a “ leading paper ” is privi-
leged to do things with comparative impunity
which would bring another paper to serious
grief. This circumstance is much to be
regretted. The country long ago decided
that the law was ruinous, wooden-headed,
narrow, cumbersome, and unworkable. And
if it begins to seriously suspect it of deferring
to social position and so on as well, there
will be very little virtue left in the great
parchment and horse-hair institution.
A N.S.W. Labour Settlement.
Egoism and altruism leagued to create the Pitt
Town Labour Settlement. Egoism was repre-
sented by the New South Wales Trades and
Labour Council, keenly alive to the danger of a
large body of unemployed hovering on the
borders of unionism ; the altruism was that of
various unspecified philanthropists forming;
“The Federal Co-operative Association of Aus
tralasia ” —a mysterious body witli a fine name;
which, like the ephemerae, exhausted its energy
in the act of procreation, and dropped quietly
out of existence. Both egoism ami altruism, to.
carry their plans into effect, relied naturally
upon good old Mother Government—■
Whose womb immeasurable and infinite breast
Teems and feeds all.
Government money started the settlement ~
Government money nourished it ; and after the
labour of 100 men has been exerted for nine
months Government money alone keeps it from
starvation.
* * *
It is, perhaps, too soon to affirm positively
that the settlement is a failure. It is not.
too soon to say that there is every prospect
that it will be a failure. Its suggestion
of an open - air workhouse is irresistible.
The “ Government stroke ” is everywhere
visible. Every man is a Civil servant,
counting sufficient for the day the rations
thereof, and contentedly looking to “the
Guvment” to meet all the responsibilities of
existence, from tucker to twins. The fault is
not in the settlers. As a body they seem
honest, intelligent, and industrious. But they
are helplessly caught in the toils of the
“simple, beautiful, arcadian” settlement
system, which demoralises them more and more
from day to day, sapping their energy, extin-
guishing their self-reliance, cramping their
industry, and doing its utmost to turn them
from self-respecting, self-helping citizens into
helpless, shiftless, and dependent paupers.
* * *
The population of the settlement fluctuates
in character, though not much in numbers.
Several settlers have been dismissed; some
resigned after being, on the ground a day';
others remained a little longer before
“ chucking up the blooming circus.” It is
vaguely stated that “about twenty-five” have
left altogether, of whom nine were expelled.
But there is no difficulty in filling up vacancies
from the floating unemployed, who are alw'ays
eager to drop into a free hut and rations and
lend a hand to boom the prosperity of the
settlement. At present, however, the men
have great and reasonable ground for dis-
content. The Board of Control, which exacts
eight hours daily labour from each man for the
benefit of the settlement, expects that some
time after hours will be devoted to improving
the quarter-acre plots on which the homes stand
—by fencing, growing a few vegetables, and
endeavouring to make the place tidy and cheer-
ful. So far, the majority of the men have
found themselves too exhausted by their
ordinary labour to do anything like this; and
there is a prevalent opinion that they should
only work five days a week, reserving the sixth
to do odd jobs for themselves, and keeping the
seventh for a day of rest, as is pious and
customary. Some dissatisfaction was also caused
by the recent eviction of a settler for alleged
misconduct. This abandoned wretch said “ 1
won’t,” when he was asked to evict, and
deliberately damned the Superintendent and
blasted the Board of Control. The result was
the curious spectacle of the Superintendsnl
knocking down the walls of the bad man’s Iml.
with a crowbar, while the bad man on the
inside tried to hold them up with a spade.
After the strong arm of Lex had been invoked
the bad man consented to go ; and as he was an
Irishman and a Catholic the sympathies of all
the other Irishmen and Catholics went with
him. The result was a meeting of settlers,
when a majority decided that the Superinten-
dent should be changed ; a petition of settlers,
in which 70 names were signed to a prayer
that no settler should be evicted without
appeal (though it is alleged that the bad
man could and did appeal) ; and a dis-
pute of settlers, which lasts to the present
time. As in Rue-Australia, the parties divide
themselves into rebels and royalists; the
minority of royalists upholding the status quo,
and the majority of rebels seeking a change of
government. The quarrel is complicated with
a Board of Advice, consisting of four settlers,
who are supposed to watch over the Superin-
tendent and report to the Board of Control,
and whose influence is thrown into the rebel
scale—each advisor being a possible Superin-
tendent. Theu the ladies of the settlement
have divided themselves between christenings
into little social cliques ; and the settlement is,
in fact, a microcosm, with all the motives,
passions, foibles and frailties which have worked
so beautifully to form and transform an older
and a lareer world.
# »
The settlement balance-sheet for six months
ended about the middle of January is interest-
ing and instructive. Government subsidy
amounted to £2330 (or, less some official deduc-
tions, £2316) ; the Village Settlement Commit-
tee (a set of unofficial sympathisers who appear
to have picked up the mantle of the Federal
Association) collected £6O ; other public dona-
tions were £l2; discounts and refunds make
£5 ; and sales of firewood cut by settlers realised
£lB. The expenses were for carting this fire-
wood, £4 ; rations, £1043 ; plant and stock,
£582 ; material for improvements, £llB ; and
working expenses, forage, and salaries, £292.
This leaves an apparent credit balance
of £372; which has been since expended,
and a debt of some £5OO contracted
(April 28) outside the grant authorised
by the Act—the only receipts since January
being £lOO paid by the Government for road-
making, and £4 or £5 from miscellaneous
sources. The debt is being steadily increased
by about £7O a week, the Minister relying that


Parliament will pass another grant. The
general opinion on the settlement is that an
advance of £l5 to £25 per family is quite in-
sufficient to start a co-operative community on
the principles of “true mateship” (blessed
words!). At least £lOO per family should be
granted if the settlement is to be a success,
and say £2O of this should be given in cash to
the settlers that they may lay in a stock of
household ornaments and utilities.
• * •
So far, all that the settlement has to show in
cash return for an expenditure of £2900 is the
trifle of £l4 (nett) for firewood—as the £lOO for
road-making is practically an additional grant.
At this rate, the date when the settlement will
be self supporting is very far in the future.
And, at the expiration of four years, in July,
1897, the settlement is supposed to begin to
pay rent for its land, as well as to pay off the
Government advances (with four per cent,
interest added) at the rate of eight per cent,
per annum. Excluding plant and stock, the
improvements have to show value for
an outlay of some £l9OO. They may be
worth that for the purposes of the
settlement; but were the settlement dis-
banded it is very doubtful if an outside
purchaser would give the Government that
much more for the land than previously. And,
when labour be added as well—taking it
roughly as 2600 weeks at 10s. per week—it is
certain that the settlement improvements are
not worth £3200 to anybody. The promoters
of the scheme thought that the Government aid
would be largely supplemented by public sub-
scriptions, as in the case of the Victorian
Tucker Settlements ; bub the public have been
quite satisfied to leave the burden on the
snoulders of the Government. The promoters
thought at the outset that; —
The settlers will have to occupy themselves at first in
doing such work as promises a speedy return. The dairy
ami agricultural farm will come into early prominence.
Firewood selling and charcoal burning, poultry-raising
and bee-culture, will also help the settlement to add
something to its scanty resources.
‘‘Outside work,” after the 48 hours a week had
been done for the settlement, was also contem-
plated. Bub as soon as the Government subsidy
began to flow, all these ideas were lost sight of.
There is little outside work, no dairy farm, no
charcoal-burning. Firewood selling has failed
as a source of revenue. Poultry-raising and
bee-culture exist on a trivial and unprofitable
scale.
• # #
Parliament will shortly have an opportunity
of discussing the condition of the Pitt Town
settlement in connection with the amending
Act, which proposes to double the original
subsidy. Whether it should be continued on
its present basis is doubtful. Yet alteration
would unquestionably provoke outcry, and it
can be plausibly alleged that in spite of a priori
reasoning and present results the settlement
has not subsisted long enough to enable a satis-
factory judgment to be given upon its future.
Possibly it would pay the province to spend
£5OOO in making Pitt Town an experimentum
crucis, which might yield a profitable lesson for
legislators to come. Certainly, the experiment
has had everything in its favour. The settlers
are not the rag-tag and bob-tail of unemployed,
but go6d picked men ; and the Board of Control
has done just as it pleased with the funds. Yet,
if the Pitt Town Labour Settlement succeeds
under existing conditions, there is no depend-
ence on human nature and no value in pre-
cedent.
“Australia for the Mongrels!”
The Kanaka does “not all die.” Some of him
is “ changed in the twinkling of an eye ” to a
respectable citizen, a land-owner or leaseholder,
an employer of labour, the husband (like a
bishop) of one wife, rearing a dusky brood who
take their place in Australian State-schools as
well washed and dressed as other people’s
children. The Kanaka is as adaptable and in-
telligent as an American negro, and more tract-
able. From a missionary point of view he is
infinitely preferable to the Rocks “push” or
the Collingwood “ push ” —which is the reason
that the “pushes” never even smell a mis-
sionary in the distance, while every little South
Sea Island is exploited by a black-coat busily
occupied in collecting the biggest cocoanuts for
Jehovah. The missionary loves the Kanaka so
Well that he would like to keep him all for
himself, and is enraged when the Queensland
planter chips in and reduces the tribute of
copra and arrowroot needed to buy Mrs.
Missionary a new piano. But in the strife
between God and Mammon, Mammon has
latterly come out on top. There was a halcyon
time when the Lord called to Samuel Walker
Griffith, and Samuel said, “ Here am I!”
Then recruiting was stopped, and a hymn of
praise ascended from every coral strand in the
Pacific. Presently, Mammon, through the
banks, pictured the ruin of Queensland ; and,
when the Lord called again, Griffith said,
“Walker!” Then recruiting recommenced,
all the able-bodied Christians were exported,
missionary revenues fell, and the hymn of
praise was drowned in the curses of the grey-
headed I)r. Paton.
* m »
It is a pity there is not enough Kanaka to go
found both the missionary and the planter ; but
the worst of it is, there is not even enough of
him to go round the planter. The Kanaka,
though tractable, is not tough. How many
Kanakas go to a ton of sugar has never been
definitely ascertained. The planters have re-
corded thousands of deaths, but the unrecorded
deaths are a multitude which no man can
uumber. Wherever amid the waving green of
* canefield you see a spot of particularly bril-
bunt emerald it is safe to say that Tommy, from
lomna, has justified his missionary training by
turning the other cheek to the smiter, and is
Working in death for the industry to which his
hie was sacrificed. There are many such bright
spots on a well-conducted plantation. And as
'Urvivors become scarce, they become valu-
. I®. The price of Kanaka labour is steadily
r ising. Bobby Towns’ pioneers were worth
phout £6 a year and rations. The rate is now
t -b, and the Kanakas are not anxious to engage
that. They have an unrecognised union to
‘feep up wa g es whose discipline would pub to
6 uatne that of any white tradesmen’s union.
If the rate offered does not suit them they
simply wait till it does. The large planters,
who indent labour direct from the islands, are
not troubled so much with this new phase of
the Kanaka question ; but the small farmers,
who cannot afford to pay down £3O or £35 for
a slave of their own, have to be content with
such time-expired “boys ” as may be offering.
At Ingham there is a union of small farmers
which tries to keep the price down to £2O a
year; but they simply cannot do it. The
Kanaka knows his market value, and gets it.
* « #
While death weeds out the weakest Kanakas,
the strongest and most intelligent set up in
business for themselves. Thankful, Will-
mett, defeated by Labour-member Ogden at
the recent Townsville election, was solaced for
his discomfiture by permission to jaunt round
the country with the junketing Ministers in
whose interest he had fought. On the Tweed
River, N.S.W., he was surprised ,to find that
some 400 time-expired Kanakas had settled,
leasing and cultivating land, and employing
white labour at the current rate of £1 a week
and tucker. In the Isis scrub, and at Kolan,
near Bundaberg, there are Kanakas and
Cingalese married to white women, and culti-
vating leased land. On the Herbert River,
still farther north, it is astonishing to see
the progress which the Kanakas have made.
Kanaka ladies ride about on horseback, daintily
gloved and booted. Their husbands drive carts
and buggies. The former manager of a large
plantation, revisiting the place the other day,
found that most of his old hands were now
working for themselves, and doing w T ell. One
“ boy ” was met driving his daughter, ele-
gantly dressed, in a cart full of corn. He was
going to sell the corn to a Chinese neighbour,
and explained that, with a few acres of rented
land, he had made £4O last year from corn
alone. How do these facts fit in with Miss
Floral Shaw’s dream of a servile black race
contentedly toiling for the profit of a white
aristocracy ?
* # #
The consequence of all these things is that
the Kanaka is unanimously voted a failure, and
there is a great cry for the importation of New
Guinea natives to take his place. Whether
MTlwraith did or didnotforeseetheadvantages
of a treasury of cheap-labour when he attempted
to annex New Guinea, the first thing he will be
asked to do on his return from England next
month is to arrange lor the substitution of a
cheap and reliable Papuan for the dear and
unreliable Kanaka. There is no doubt that
MTlwraith will do this if he possibly can ;
and the departure of Administrator Macgregor,
who, as a missionary’s man, has consistently set
his face against sending New Guinea natives
to cement with their blood the altar of
the sugar industry, falls out most con-
veniently. The small farmers with 40 acres
are just as eager for the degradation of their
own race as the big planters with 4000 acres,
affording another illustration of the old truth
that a man’s situation is chiefly responsible for
his opinions. The white labourer, who shouts
against the employment of coloured races, shouts
for them as soon ns he becomes an employer.
The various substitutes for the Kanaka—
Javanese, Japanese, Malays, Cingalese, Italians
—have all proved unsatisfactory ; but better
things are hoped from the near-at-hand Papuan.
In face of the fact now admitted by black-
labour apologists, that white men can do all
the work of sugar-growth and manufacture,
while the profits will pay higher wages than
any other form of agriculture, it remains to be
seen whether there are sufficient white men in
Queensland to defeat this attempt to immolate
another savage race in the interests of “ Aus-
tralia for the mongrels !”
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Dibbs on the "Servant Gal” Question.
A deputation waited, the other day, on N.S. W.
Premier Dibbs re the establishment of a State
clothing factory, and that erratic politician
straightway flew off the handle and proceeded
to discuss the “ servant gal ” question with
extreme ferocity. The deputation wanted to
draw attention to the sweating of girls em-
ployed on Government contracts, and there-
upon the discursive Premier started to bang
things about in a loud tone of voice, and wanted
to know why these girls didn’t take to domestic
service. Domestic service, he pointed out, is as
honourable an employment as any other and
more honourable than many, and if the Aus-
tralian girl won’t take to it then Dibbs has no
sympathy with her troubles, whatever they
may be. The reasons why she won’t take to it
are quite beyond Dibbs’s comprehension. This
is a favourite attitude with the desperately
practical variety of politician, yet the reasons
why the Australian girl, or any other decently
educated girl, only takes to service as an alter-
native to suicide or thereabouts is so apparent
that even the blindest politician should be able
to recognise it. The domestic servant, by
common consent of men and women alike, is
a being of the lowest description, who
can only associate with other servants,
and the like. The prejudice is idiotic, no
doubt, but it exists, and there is no arguing
against a certainty. From a social point of
view, to become an ordinary domestic is just as
hopeless as to become a hangman. It is the
same thing as losing caste, or being a China-
man, or a nigger, and almost the same thing as
being suspected of leprosy. And it is a note-
worthy circumstance that.the Dibbs variety of
politician is as badly afflicted by this prejudice
as anybody else. He never, by any chance,
marries a servant, or, even it he falls upon evil
days, suffers his daughter to become one—in
most cases, he would just as soon see her dead
and decently buried. To become a servant
means, in 99 per cent, of cases, that the person
who does it must be content to be a servant for
ever, or, at the best, to marry some more than
usually humble variety of artisan, or to wed the
Chinese vegetable-JoiiN. Therefore, no one
takes to the work except the utterly-soulless
drudge who has no semblance of ambition, and
doesn’t want to have any. In short, the Aus-
tralian girl’s reason for not being a slavey is
just the same reason which keeps Dibbs, in the
occasional intervals when he is out of politics,
from being a footman —a billet for which his
calves are eminently suited.
If Compulsory—then Free!
In' a recent Bulletin article, attention was
drawn to the heavy increase of late in the
number of New South Wales people unable to
pay for their children’s schooling, and who,
consequently, are either forced to keep them at
home, or else have their names placed on the
“ Exemption from School-fees List,” and send
them as State paupers. Following on this come
the recently - published consolidated-revenue
returns, showing the total amounts of school-
fees collected throughout New South Wales
during the April months of ’93 and ’94, respec-
tively. Under the head, “ Public-school fees,”
the returns show a falling-off of £3456 for
April of the present year, as compared
with the corresponding month of ’93. Last
month’s school-fees, for the whole of the pro-
vince, contributed £4045 to the revenue,
which amount, taken as the monthly average
—apart from the fact that the decrease
is greater each succeeding month gives
£48,540 as the total annual sum derived from
this source from all the provincial schools.
From this amount, however, must be deducted
the cost of collecting same, the value of the
time lost to both pupils and teachers in mark-
ing the roll-books, the cost of printing the
books and the other incidental forms, which
brings the £48,000 down to a very insignificant
figure indeed. And for this paltry sum New
South Wales endures the branding as paupers
of hundreds of children whose parents can-
not afford to pay for the education which
the State makes compulsory ! By this system
New South Wales practically offers to her
citizens the choice of two evils : “ Be pauperised
or be gaoled ! ” And, by the way, it is a moot
question whether there is not yet another terror
added to the choice. The new Electoral Act
decrees that persons receiving public charity
are not bo be allowed a vote ; and if that
clause has any meaning at all it is that
the man whose offspring attends the
State school on the exemption ticket is a
pariah and an outcast in his own country, and
without any voice whatsoever in the administra-
tion of the country’s affairs. When the present
Education Act was framed the charge of 3d.
per week for each pupil, with a maximum of
Is. for as many as liked to attend school from
one family, was never seriously regarded as a
source of revenue. The clause was merely in-
serted as a compromise with the enemies of free
education, their excuse, at the time, being
“ that the community would prefer to pay a
small fee.” The ever-increasing numbers of
people who are now applying for exemption
from school-fees amply gives the lie to this
miserable assertion—two suburban schools ( not
in “poor” neighbourhoods) having between
them at present over 500 names on the pauper
lists. The natural corollary to compulsory
education is free education, and it is an auto-
cratic country indeed that does not give ab-
solutely free of charge everything that it com-
pels its citizens to have.
The Pastoral Grab.
In the new agreement which the Pastoralists’
Union has drawn up for its own benefit, and
which it proposes to cram down the throats of
the shearers by brute force, there is.one clause
(the Bth) which, for pure, hog-like brutality,
has seldom been equalled. It reads thus :
It is hereby distinctly understood and agreed that the
person in charge of the shed on behalf of the employer, or
such other person as the employer may see lit to appoint,
shall be the person to decide all questions arising under
this agreement or the rules endorsed hereon, and that his
decision upon all such questions shall be Anal and con-
clusive.
Which, as the president and secretary of the
Shearers’ Union point out in a letter to the
S.M. Herald, means, among many other
things, the following:—
If you shear 100 sheep a day, and the boss says you
have only sheared 90, his decision is final. (Also, if he
says you have only sheared 70, his decision, under the
agreement, is also final. Likewise, his decision is final if
he says you haven’t shorn any at all.)
If he runs in full-grown rams, and says that they are
under six months old, you cannot object. Even if the
boss asserted that the rams were all ewes, his decision is
“final and conclusive,” and the shearer would only get
one for one.
If the sheep come into the pen immediately after
swimming a river, and the boss said that they were dry,
you would have to shear them or go to gaol.
If you have already worked the 48 hours provided in
the rules, and the boss said that you have not, you would
have to go on working, as his decision is 11 final and con-
clusive.”
If you refuse to shear oancered sheep, the boss can
make you do it by asserting that they are not cancered.
His decision on “ all questions ” is “ final and con-
clusive.”
If the cook wasted tucker so that your account ran up
to 30s. per man per week you couldn’tsack him, as he and
his assistants are brought under the agreement, and if he
disputed the action of the shearers the employer or his
representative would have the right to settle it, and
would, of course, be most likely to compel the shearers
to keep the cook by whom the squatter made the most
profit.
The pastoralists’ assumption is, of course, that
the average squatter is a gentleman and
wouldn’t do such things. Considering, how-
ever, how the Pastoralists’ Union has burst up
its solemn pledge to adhere to the old agree-
ment, the general opinion will certainly be that
it is capable of many meannesses. Anyhow,
when a body of men proposes to fight to the
bitter end for the power to do so heartless
a thing, the reasonable assumption is that it
intends to use the power when it gets it.
Otherwise, there is absolutely nothing to fight
for. When the U.S. Confederacy fought a four
years’ war principally in defence of the right to
hold slaves, no one supposed that they did it
with the intention of setting the slaves free
when they won. Man isn’t built that way.

Patterson’s Land Bank.
The Victorian Government has expanded its
scheme of a State Land Bank to something like
respectable proportions, and is making a big bid
for popularity on the strength of it. Its pre-
sent proposal is to borrow by instalments some
£15,000,000 or £20,000,000 at 4 per cent., and
lend it out on the security of agricultural lands
at 5 per cent; No loan is to exceed 50 per cent,
of the value of the security, so the business
will be conducted with a minimum of
risk. Under present conditions the mort-
gaged agriculturist pays ten, twelve, or even
more per cent, for loans, therefore the
State Land Bank will, in the first place, lighten
his load fully one-half. The agriculturist, in
fact, supplies the best security and pays the
highest interest of all borrowers—a result
which is partly owing to his ignorance of
finance, and partly to other causes. In addi-
tion to the 5 per cent, interest, the borrower,
under the new system, will pay 2 per cent,
towards a sinking-fund, which, at compound
interest, will extinguish his debt in about 26
years. Therefore, he will get rid of both
principal and interest for an annual pay-
ment which is not much more than half
that now frequently levied for interest
alone. Also, his loan will be for a definite
period, and will not be liable to be called up
suddenly at the caprice of a bank-manager or
liquidator. The scheme is excellent, and it is
also absolutely practicable, for it has already been
tried for many years past in Europe with
splendid success. The only question is, whether
the land-boom Cabinet has any real intention
of carrying it out, and those who have had a
long experience of Shambles Patterson are
more than doubtful on this point. If the pro-
ject is carried out, it will probably knock the
bottom out of several atrophied banks, and
out of many leaky finance companies, and it
will be a serious blow to Moses, the usurer,
and his brother, the Christian bill-of-sale
man. Also, the success of the experiment will
rouse a new agitation for a State bank, and for
several other things which are abhorrent to the
financial soul. And the idea that James B.
Patterson, of all men, should propose to sit
down on the banking interest of Victoria looks
utterly and absolutely impossible—even the
leopard changing his spots would not be a patch
upon such an event as that. Most probably the
scheme is simply an advertisement, and it has
been expanded from its first feeble beginnings
in order to make it a first-class advertisement,
and at the same time to ensure its rejection by
the House of Property. Then the bull-voiced
Premier will have all the credit of being the
man who introduced one of the grandest and
most thoroughly democratic schemes ever laid
before an Australian Parliament, and will also
have all the material advantages which are to
be gained by making dead certain that his own
grand scheme will be softly dropped into the
waste-paper basket. What the country wants
now is to take hold of Patterson’s lofty
inspiration so enthusiastically that it will be
rushed through by a process of pure terrorism
right before the eyes of its astonished owner.
Heaven grant that Patterson is really in
earnest 1

The Other Side of Mildura.
Editor Bulletin, —Mildura as it is boomed
is one thing ; Mildura as it exists is another.
The present state of things in this much-
belauded Victorian irrigation settlement is that,
behind vast complications, the settlers and un-
employed are waiting for the sale of the sea-
son’s raisin-crop and the floating of a loan,
which will go to pay for another crop. The con-
trolljng firm is waiting upon the settlers for
£30,000 arrears, and the employes of each
and all are patiently looking forward to the
millennium. Mildura, as it is supposed to be,
blooms gorgeously in the imaginations of sundry
enterprising land-agents, journalists, toadies
and highly respectable, but credulous papas,
mammas and guardians. “ Send our dear boy
to Mildura,” says Prudence ; “ temperance
settlement, you know.” And so the darling
boy arrives, gets drunk on “cool summer
drinks,” and goes to swell the ranks of
that wonderful company, the Queen’s
Own Impecunious Remittancers which is
strong at Mildura. The settlement is
now paying a heavy penalty for mis-
representation and mismanagement. Busi-
ness, in spite of large scale and misleading
advertisement, is absolutely paralysed. It is
humorously pathetic to see in tradesmen’s
windows notices to the effect that “ orders will
be taken on ” certain firms. It is funny to hear
of a man eating out a debt at a debtor’s table.
But it is more pathetic than humorous to see
a fellow who hoped to draw on his employers
cudgelling his brain to find out how best to
live till “ next Saturday.” Mildura is nothing
more or less than a gaol to many of its
residents. The storekeeper can’t sell out, and
if he could couldn’t recover debts and outlay.
The employd must keep on working, lest he
lose back pay. And so on. Talk to a settler,
and you listen to a tale of woe about broken
promises, and plants dying for want of water,
to which, by virtue of paying a heavy price for
his land, etc., he believed he had undisputed
right at all times. “An agent told me the
college was in full swing,” says a young agri-
culturist. “ I came, and find the foundations
laid.” “I understood ” this or that is an expres-
sion used 20 times a day by the outraged
“block” holder. “My dear sir, to tell you
the truth, I keep fully half-a-dozen families
going,” says a baker. Inference is that they
live on bread and a little fruit. “Let me
have a shave or haircut till the loan
comes.” These are some of the daily
remarks of Milduraites; sotto voce, there
are curses, bitter curses. The comedy of
Mildura is enacted in the highway, on the
Salvation-square, and other public places; the
tragedy—and there is a tragedy-—in the home,
the office, and those hell-dens, the sly-grog-
geries. In plain English, Mildura spells dis-
appointed hopes, clique and discord. The
many are dependent upon the few by reason
of their previous blindness, and the few are
reaping the reward of unfulfilled nromises

A ridiculously elongated enquiry into the fit-
ness of ex-manager Priestley to liquidate the
Federal Bank has come to the foregone decision
that Priestley is an undesirable man for the
job. This was always as clear as the scandal
of sundry other persona continuing to act as
liquidators of sundry other busted institutions,
but it has taken the Law a year, more or less
to discern the obvious fact. Now that the
gummy eyes of said Law are open, and its
bleary gaze is turned to the true character of
the Federal Bank management, a conditional

order for Mr. Priestley’s removal, “ without
ignominy,” has been made. There the matter
appears to stop short. Priestley is condemned
for his comparatively venial connection with
the misdeeds of his directors, but the
directors are condemned for nothing because,
says Judge Holroyd, “ they have not been
brought before mo to answer for any alleged
offence or misbehaviour.” Here it is amusing to
notice that the Law has taken an unconscion-
ably long time in coming to a conclusion about
the man who wouldn’t bring James Munro and
Co. to book, and even now the Law has con-
cluded to let the stumbling-block remain in
position until the end of this year, if certain
conditions be fulfilled. In the Federal case, as
in the Freehold Investment ditto, a Judge talks
vaguely about what he might do if something
were brought before him, without dwelling
upon the public effect of his leaving undone the
duty that remains in the background. In the
Mercantile trial the Law professed its infantile
ignorance of facts which were a possible matter
for consideration in a non-existent “ elsewhere.”
The Law, as regards Melbourne’s financial
scandals, seems to expend most of its energy in
a desperate endeavour to avoid coming to the
point.
The speeches at the new Brisbane Trades’ Hall
opening were chiefly notable for the marked
difference between ex-Labour-leader Glassey’s
opinions and those of Labour - members
M'Donald, Reid and Co. The latter showed
as bitter extremists, refusing to recognise in-
dependent democrats as friends of the Labour
party; and insisting that all who didn’t sub-
scribe to the A.L.F. platform were to be ranked
with the enemy. (This was a knock at ex-Chief
Justice Lilley, the “ candid friend ” of the
Q. Labour party.) Glassey, on the other hand,
welcomed half-hogmen, on the ground that
half a hog was a great deal better than no
hog at all. Glassey, in fact, is rapidly re-
ceding from the Labour platform—not because
he is a worse Labour-man, but because he is a
better democrat. Five years ago, he was
simply a bumptious, pragmatical ass, with a
weary flow of hackneyed platitudes. Now, he
is becoming a thoughtful, intelligent man, a
man to reckon with; and his platitudes have
pith. The reason is that he has had five years’
Parliamentary education and a trip to America.
His eyes are opened ; and he has left far behind
his old comrades, who have not enjoyed his
advantages. The same lesson is, to a great
extent, taught by the contrast between the
N.S.W. Labour-men in Parliament now and
three years ago. Three years ago they had
just as scanty a sense of proportion and possi-
bility as the present league delegates ; now,
thanks to Parliamentary training, the pot is
able to rise up and condemn the kettle’s crude
notions.
J. G. Drake, the most brilliant man in Q.
Parliament, is back from the European trip
paid for out of the £1963 9s. 3d. fees which he
earned in the great Robb arbitration case, and,
interviewed in Sydney on the point of the
Labour-party’s pledge, speaks against it as
strongly as The Bulletin has tried to do
At the next general election, if the Labour-party pursue
the policy proposed, the Labour candidate will be ham-
pered by pledges which will focus against him every ray
of opposition, while the Government candidate will have
a free hand to pledge and promise, solemnly vow and
declare to his heart’s content, with a secret understanding
—which self-interest will render more binding than any
election pledge—that he shall vote straight for his party
whenever his vote is wanted.
Illustrating his argument from Q. politics,
Drake pointed out that—
The average MTlwraithian candidate will give any
pledge required, and if verbal promises will not pass cur-
rent he will—as Thomas MTlwraxth did in 1888— give
them in writing.
This refers to the election handbill issued by
MTlwraith, which ran :
To the Electors of North Brisbane.—Gentlemen,—With
a view of showing you the absurdity of the statements
made by my opponents, I now pledge myself to the fol-
lowing, it I am returned to power:—Not to allow the
introduction of coolie or other coloured labour ; not to
allow the introduction of Chinese ; not to pay the survey
fees of the transcontinental railway syndicate ; not to in-
troduce or support a transcontinental railway Bill or
scheme.— l am, gentlemen, your obedient servant, Thomas
MTlwraith.
MTlwraith was returned to power ; Kanakas
were re-introduced almost immediately after-
wards ; coolies and Chinamen have been coming
in ever since ; and he has just been doing his
best in England to form a transcontinental land-
grant railway syndicate. He told the electors
that he “ would be scouted as a liar all over the
country if he broke his word ; ” he has trebly
broken it, and the “ leading ” newspapers can-
not praise him* sufficiently. As the M‘ll-
- standard of ethics is quite as high as
that of the average man, judge from this of the
value of pledges in New South Wales. Drake
went on to point out that the Queensland
Labour-party was the only bulwark against
utter political demoralisation ; and added that
he hoped much from the future, but was con-
tent to go slowly.
It is a good thing to have bright ideals and to aim high,
but we must tread the road to reach the goal. There are
no flying machines in politics.
It is a pity that a clever man like this should
not have a greater following. Drake is liked,
appreciated, feared, but not trusted. With a
little less, honesty he would lead the Minis-
terialists ; with a little less intelligence,. he
would lead the Labour-party. He dazzles, but
daunts, the average elector, who invariably
associates fidelity with dulness, and wit with
insincerity. Drake is not a rich man, and his.
Robb brief was thrown to him to shut his
mouth. When he accepted it, the average
elector was convinced his judgment was correct.
It is a pity.

One of the saddest things which has happened
to the Freetrade-party since it first began is set
forth in a last week’s cablegram. The U.S.
Tariff Bill—the result of the great Democratic
and alleged Freetrade upheaval of a year or
two ago —has at last passed the Senate, and in
its final shape “the duties are, on the whole,
slightly under those imposed by the M’Kinley
Act.” It is a dismal and impotent conclusion
to all the bellowing and riot of the Parkes
brigade and the Sydney D.T. TheM’KiNLEY Act
created in the U.S. the highest tariff on earth,
and if the duties now imposed are only “ on the
whole, slightly under ” the old lot, then the
U.S. has got the highest tariff on earth still,
and is going to stick to it. The only possible
deduction is that there is no Freetrade-party in
the States at all, and never was any, save in
the drunken imagination of the Sydney Tele-
graph apd Co.
Latest rumours from Paraguay are that Lane
has been deposed from his billet as dictator,
that there have been more secessions from Rue
Australia, and that the crowd originally evicted
is starving and destitute and in a hopeless
condition. Meanwhile Mr. James Mooney has
returned to Australia to eloquently explain
away these circumstances and to beat up more
recruits, and this gentleman, like his chief, dis-
courses unctuously about the “ deep religious
under-current ” in the movement. He also
announces that the German working-classes are
in a furore about it, and that there are prospects
of a general rush of settlers from Europe. This
is probably intended as a hint that the people of
this country had better hurry up before Para-
guay gets full. Meanwhile, captains from the
Rio de la Plata announce that they are
besieged by evicted New Australians begging
for passages home again. The Royal Tar
didn’t give any of them a lift on the return
voyage. That Vessel even discharged its old
crew at Monte Video and came back with an
entirely fresh lot, who had no unpleasant tales
to tell about the troubles and tatters of the
argonauts and the episodes of the last trip.
The wisdom of this arrangement will probably
appear later on.

What sort of a “fair trial” can the alleged
Barraba assassins possibly get in Sydney ? One
Daily Telegraph heading is :—“ Cummins and
Lee, accused of the murder of Mr. M‘Kay,
exhibited a sullen demeanour.” Which means,
of course, that they refused to be pumped.
And they are right The prisoner, innocent or
guilty, who talks freely to the average police-
man, is only manufacturing evidence against
himself. Says another daily : —“ The great-
est interest is taken all over the district in
the trial of the outlaws.” “ Outlaws ’’—though
legally innocent until proved guilty before a
jury. That paper must now have a strong
pecuniary interest in securing a conviction
against Cummins at least, for should he be
acquitted he may resort to blue paper. Several
other papers published the alleged criminal
record of one of the prisoners, who surely
was entitled to go unjudged before his jury.
Half the newspapers could not be mope grossly
unfair even were they edited by hangmen
paid at so much per neck. And here you
have Sydney newspapers, in their reports of the
investigation into the murder, the legal object
of which investigation was to discover whether
a prima-facie case existed against Cummins
and Lee, over and over again, while the
examination went on, complimenting detective
Goulder on his “shrewdness,” and inspector
Casey on his “skill.” If Cummins and Lee
were innocent, there could be no compliment
for either shrewdness or skill; the efforts of
both officers would rank simply as blunders,
and the more laboured they were the more
egregious would the blunders be. The compli-
ments were, it would seem, therefore given in
light of a foregone conclusion that Cummins
and Lee were guilty.
The modest Governor Kintorb, of S.A., was
recently made an honorary LL.D. of Cambridge
University, on which occasion the “Public
Orator ” drivelled in the following alarming
fashion :
With what pleasure do we greet one ot our own foster
sons who sprang from him who founded in Northern
Britain the renowned College of Aberdeen, and is yet
proud of being the guardian of the University of Adelaide,
a University which we, not Without some pride, number
amongst our daughters. He, pro-consul of a mighty
province extending four times beyond the area of all
Gaul and all Germany, boldly traversed so vast a region,
takiiw with him as companion on this long journey a
Cambridge physician, whose very name recalls to memory
a fortress of his own Caledonia. Why need I tell of the
more than forty days bravely borne under the leadership
of our pro consul amid barren and thirsty wastes, and of
the secret solitudes of Nature so auspiciously laid open.
Why not to mention mightier deeds, tell of the new kind
of mole which bears the name of Notoryotes, dragged
from its dark hiding place to the light ot day. Why tell
of the huge fossils of a prehistoric monster called the
Diprotodon now at length disclosed to our age under his
auspices, and, as I may say, under his direction. Him-
self numbered amongst the more illustrious Knights of St.
George, I would speak of, not as one who tamed the
storied dragon with sword and spear, but as one who
successfully laid bare, at great expense and labour, the
vast relics of monsters no less dreadful. It is by the aid
of such men as these that the most distant provinces of
the British Empire are linked to us by still closer ties,
and as well the boundaries of science, so many times
advanced by our sons, are stretched day by day to still
wider limits. I present to you a distinguished patron of
the sciences, one who is at the same time both the
Governor and the untired explorer of a vast province, a
man most closely bound to us, both by his own and his
brother’s name, Algernon Keith-Falooner, Earl of Kin-
tore.”
And the “untired explorer” endured this
beery outpouring in silence, and didn’t even
rise to explain that he “explored” mostly
along a road, with spring-mattresses and novels
and crates of expensive liquor, and had the
daily news telegraphed to him as he went
along. Also, he didn’t explain that he was in
no way responsible for dragging the mole into
the light of day—which was an unkind thing
to do in any case, or for the other animal with
the complicated name. He simply accepted
the sickening gush in silence.
[?]
846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,
May 16, 1894.
My Dear Moorabinda—
Now that Cardinal Moran has publicly de-
nounced the practice of hypnotism and spiritualism
all good Catholics will, no doubt, refrain from
sitting round a table with the gas at half-cock
while the spirit of John Smith is a-tapping, and
a pause will be given to the popular pastime of
calling spirits from the vasty deep who come when
you do call and let you feel their garments. Bub
I don’t think what is known as spiritualism is all
“juggling and trickery,” no matter whab bhe
monkeries may say.
If Cardinal Moran will call ab the house of a
certain very enquiring Eliaabeth-street doctor
(who, by the way, is understood to belong to the
faithful) he will be introduced to a phenomenon
calculated to make him reflect. What would the
Cardinal think, for example, if he were in a
passage with heavy doors just lightly closed, and
if, on his approach, they opened of their own
accord ? His Eminence might think (as a great
many people would) that his personal importance
warranted this ghostly politeness on the part of
the fittings, but that wouldn’t really satisfy his
intellect when ho thought it all over. Dr.
M’Carthy demonstrates the queer hair-raising
phenomenon of tlie opening door. The heavy
cedar door of a room the windows whereof are
closely shut so as to preclude draught, is swung to,
within half an inch of closing-point. The
“ medium ” raises her hands above her head and
almost, but not quite, touches the door, which
presently trembles and then opens inwards with a
strong, swift, emphatic swing. Ib is a weird
thing to see that heavy door move thus, at the
volition of some unknown force, and to feel the
cold air swish in the empty room. What is the
force? The doctor doesn’t know, and doesn’t
pretend to know, but one must believe the evi-
dence of one’s senses.
Haven’t you often noticed that some men have
a careless habit of scribbling memoranda on their
shirt-cuffs, quite ignoring the fact that what they
write may “all come out in the washing?” I have
often thought that the bacillus of a rousing
matrimonial fray must frequently lie hidden in
the dates, engagements, after-the-ball addresses,
and so on, that men jot down so jauntily on their
wrist-linen.
So, I wasn’t surprised to hear, the other day,
the sad story of a professional man whose wife
threatened to pack her bag of tricks and go
straight home to ma, just because of four lines of
lead-pencil on hubby’s shirt-cuff ! It was only a
“direction,” too, but then my attention has been
drawn to the fact that there are addresses and
addresses, and this was one of the latter. How
Mrs. Lawyer knew it was ’tis a matter of conjec-
ture, and ought, one would think, to have given
hubby a good peg whereon to hang a startling
defence. The only really safe shirt-cuff scribbler
is your gay and festive bachelor.
Speaking of—or I should say, alluding in the
most veiled manner in the world to—er—shirts, I
am led to believe that a vast army of ungilded
youths who have to make one collar do the work
of six, would rise up and call that manufacturer
blessed who printed his name in smaller letters
and right at the back of the collar, also the size of
the thing and its fancy name might occur in a
more unobtrusive manner than they do at present.
This is unfortunately a period of turned collars
owing to one side going bald through over-work,
and any shirt-maker who put his flourish of trum-
pets where the wearer’s neck would hide it if the
collar had to go on inside-out for economical
reasons, might even call his invention “ The
Woman Suffrage ” collar if he chose, for nothing
on earth would stop the frantic sale of ’em.
The relief-crews for the warships on the Aus-
tralian station arrived per extra special man-o’-
war the other day, and Sydney belledom is full of
rose-coloured anticipations at the presence of
nearly 20 full-grown, brand-new officers, not to
speak of middies. If there is one thing more than
another that keeps the Imperialistic spirit flourish-
ing sturdily round Potts Point it is the sure and
certain “shifts” that occur periodically in naval
and military circles, and which stir up a depressed
marriage-market when stock has gone flat all
round —if I may speak in language understood of
drapery-dukes and duchesses.
By the way, the belle who backs one of the
new “ reliefs ” into double-harness won’t, as a rule,
have a Ouida-esque name to flourish on her
pasteboard. They are nearly all commonplace to
the verge of exasperation, when you come to think
of the Cecil Claude Montmorency de Veres, and
so on, whom we have had with us. Neither
Higginson, Snell, nor Cockey, is the sort of name
a lovely maiden’s imagination broiders on her
hero’s pocket-handkerchiefs.
Apropos of the “ Service ’’—the proceedings at
the court-martial on a naval officer for embezzle-
ment, which was held on the Orlando the other
day, seemed to be a cut above (or below) the case
of the ordinary embezzler, so far as the deep dis-
credit of the thing is concerned. The culprit—
who had been assistant-paymaster on the flag-ship
—was well-known in Australian society, where he
had been a familiar figure for nearly six years,
but, all the same, the court sentenced him to one
year’s imprisonment, and to be dismissed the navy
with disgrace. I think the court might have cut
out the prison-part of it. A stone cell must be a
mere bagatelle to a man who has been publicly
stripped of his epaulettes. Perhaps, however, the
reckless, unfortunate young fellow is glad to hide
himself in gaol.
How uncomplimentary is the haste with which
the relieved (what a glove-fit some adjectival
adverbs are to be sure !) naval officers hasten to
quit Australian shores, where everything has been
“so awfully jolly, dontcherknow ” (until the
reprieve comes alongside) that you’d almost think
they would linger longer, or at least go reluctantly
by return warship when their term was up.
But the Ormuz absolutely swarmed with officers
when she got away only one or two days after the
arrival of the relief crews. Certainly most of the
gallant tars were married and probably preferred
to go “ home ” with one eye on the partner of
their joys and sorrows—for a grass-widow on a
mail-boat is a creature of infinite possibilities—
but still to rush off by the very first means of
transit, much as Robinson Crusoe broke away in
a bark canoe, hardly looks as if the Australian
station is so fascinating as it is said to be. I
remember a pimply middy saying patronisingly to
me, once, as a poor aboriginal who wanted a little
encouragement, “ Oh, we Piers are quite pleased
when we’re ordahed to the ’Stralian station, ye
know.” But this almost instantaneous flight of
epaulettes looks as if “we Piers” were more
pleased to be ordahed off it.
Miss Ada Bell, whose highly artistic studio on
George-street block rejoices in the rather girly-
girly name of “ Flowerland,” has an interesting
commission on the stocks just now at the “com-
mand ” of Empress Frederick, who intends it as
a gift to Queen Victoria, her ma. It is a hand-
painted chess-board, alternate squares containing
miniatures in water-colour of most of the dainty
works of art Miss Bell purposes exhibiting at

at Sydney Town Hall on 22nd inst.), the “ relief”

Even in an unfinished state the chess-board is a
thing of beauty.
Vice doesn’t flaunt in silk attire in “A King
of Crime,” at Sydney Her Majesty’s. As a hard-
boiled fact there isn’t a dress in the drama, for the
gay ladies who high-kick in the “ Moulin Rouge ”
scene seemed to have studied more what they
could leave off than what they could put on, and
the lovely Mr. Westmaoott’s brown brocade
court-suit and Maltese-lace tie—which became his
profile to a T—must occupy the dress pedestal in
this “ penny plain, twopence coloured ” drama.
Miss Watts-Phillips was bound by every theatri-
cal law to wear grey, and wisely, too, for it gives
them a misty, filmy appearance, suggestive of a
blurred vision and a dog on a string; and Miss
Athena Claudius, in a baggy sage-green frock,
reminded me of a would-be dress reform maiden
who had jibbed at the trouserettes.
Nothing would ever convince me that women
ought to be treated allee same ns men. Every-
thing makes it impossible. Even the. wording of
a mixed-committee notice ought to be different.
The recent hospital-ball meeting at Government
House, with her Excellency Lady Duff (for that is
the title solemnly conferred upon her by the lady-
president of Sydney Women’s College) presiding
part of the time, which was as much as the vice-
regal flesh and blood could be expected to do,
after having*previously wasted a whole afternoon
on the committee, who actually forgot their
appointment—but this sentence has grown so long
and unmanageable that I start afresh.
On that occasion the committee was a mixture
—ladies predominating—but the reporter went to
work on the rules and regulations of the gather-
ing, as if it was a municipal council meeting.
“The committee consisted of” a long list of
men’s and women’s cognomens, which was all very
well if he hadn’t concluded “ with power to add to
their number.” That was what set people on the
broad grin.
Sydney Guvmentouse has a new charm for local
belledom (which has a very gay 6 to 2 chance of
getting off the shelf this season, with so many
fresh youths in the market and no Gaiety co.,
coming to empty the pockets of eligible young
men) in the shape of Mr. R. W. Duff, one of Sir
Robert Duff’s three sons, who is in training for
the diplomatic service, and who visits this impos-
sible territory to see what frightful places are in
the world ; also, to do A.D.O. work for the
distinguished author of his being in between the
acts.
If this youth is the makings of a record ambas-
sador he couldn’t have done a better thing for his
particular line of business than to come to Aus-
tralia, just now. At this juncture, Gov. Duff
needs a budding Rosebery in his pocket more
urgently than anything else if he desires to recover
lost ground and leave, when his time comes, in a
Caringtonian halo of roses.
Mr. R. W. Duff is not a son of Anak, by the
way. He had the misfortune to break both his
legs, some years ago, and this painful accident
appears to have interfered with his growth.
However, height has nothing to do with the suc-
cess of a diplomat whose brains don’t weigh
according to his inches.
The first day of the tennis-tournament, Gee-
bungs v. Cornstalks, on the cricket-pitch, at
Sydney Ass. ground, was the usual garden-party
outing at which every woman sported her new
frock and preferred a position where the sun fell
on her paste hat-pin. Tennis-matches are merely
a dress-parade—and though a certain number of
damsels stood up on chairs (for all the world as if
somebody had seen a mouse coming across
country !) to view the game—still the play most
decidedly isn’t the thing at a tennis-outbreak.
The Saturday afternoon crowd wasn’t the top
of the social teapot, so to speak, although there
was a little leaven to leaven the whole lump.
When fashion has got her wooing eye on another
game it is really wonderful how quickly society s
taste in sports and pastimes alters to suit the
times. With a tennis-court attached to almost
every State-school in the country it isn’t very
strange that the death-knell of the ball-and-
racquet game was rung for all but a few incor-
rigible enthusiasts, and “society” scanned the
horizon for a more original amusement. Where
are the gilded vouths and maidens who swaggered

patient and you will soon have them poking out
your eye with their golf-sticks.
But if tennis js rio longer an exclusively fashion-
aole kill-time, it is certainly a more athletic sport
than formerly. The players under discussion, who
are met to see which team can keep a ball bouncing
the longest, do not play as the curates do; no
hollow-chested weakling can stand up to “ five
fast singles ” (that is their botanical name, but
.Iwk like a sort of parlour grape-shot to the
uninitiated) without having to be taken home in a
barrow; and I am led to believe that if tennis
warms up much more only a South Melbourne
football-team will be equal to the muscular pres-
sure of the pastime. By the way, are most he-
tennis - players bachelors ? Echo answers yes,
judging by the holes in their stockings.
(( Miss Maud Fitz-Stubbs, whose dashing
“Heather” waltz is played and praised
by London’s own Dan Godfrey, thereby
popularising it throughout England, is not rest-
ing on her oars and shaking hands with
her ambition. Last week she published another
lively waltz—the “ Orlando.” I suppose every-
body _ will dance to its tune this season
—it is a far better dancing waltz than the
“ Heather,” if not so bright and exhilarating—but
if everybody insists on singing the vocal part of it
the waltz should be written in various keys, for
very few dancers could take a high, remorseless G
with any degree of complacency—before supper, at
least. By the way, I meant to say last week that
I had received Mr. Smith’s “ Hopetoun ” polka,
dedicated to Lord Hopetoun. People who like to
play vice-regal music may like to play this polka,
too—on principle.
The freshly-announced engagement of a Bara-
tarian A.D.O. to a real live heiress leaves the
future a dull and dreary stretch to many a deserv-
ing fortune-hunter. People remember the effect
of her first appearance at the Baratarian Club
ball, when the “stand” looked like the “Cup”
favourite’s stall before the race starts —there was
such a mob of men around it. Flies round a
sugar-bowl is cheap metaphor, but it fits. And
now she weds the brother of a coronet, as they say
in the penny novelettes. She and her A-D.C.
have at least one sympathy in common (if not
more, for people say he is a most agreeable youth)
and that is a pronounced taste for amateur-
theatricals.
The ball in aid of the French poor of Sydney
takes place in Paddington Town Hall next Wed-
nesday evening (23rd inst.), in the presence of
Lady Duff and Madame Biard d’Aunet, also the
officers of the Fasana, and many big fish. The
tickets are selling quickly, and I am told that
several of the ladies are donating French dishes to
the supper-table. The next eleesinosynary hop
after the French dance will be that of the Fresh
Air League, which (on 26th June) promises to be
a very big affair.

The “ Bauble Shop ” rather improves than
otherwise as time goes on, and after a spell of the
somewhat unwholesome “Mrs. Tanqueray ” it is
refreshing to the soul. A considerable amount of
controversy, however, rages as to the true inward-
ness of Jones’s drama. The question at issue is
whether the Social Purity man, having got
Titheradge down and jumped on him with both
his spiritual boots in the interests of morality,
relents at the last moment, being convinced that
his suspicions were groundless; and whether the
peer rises again from the political dead at some
future date. The Bulletin unhesitatingly avers
that he doesn’t; that he remains down for ever
afterwards, and is despised and rejected by all the
people of uneasy virtue for the rest of his life.
There is no verbal evidence on the subject, for the
drama concludes in dead silence, but the back
view of Stoaoh, M.P., as he tramps out is suffi-
cient evidence that there is no relenting about
him. Besides, the Social Purity bellower never
does relent; even if Gabriel, the archangel,
assured him that there was a little morality in
this world, outside his own small crowd of blatant
expounders, he would merely smell the archangel
for traces of drink, and suspect him of having
been out late the previous night under circum-
stances which wouldn’t bear inspection.
* * *
Miss Emma Temple, who was somehow
crowded out of last week’s notice, is a graceful
and amusing side-show in the drama, and her
wild music-hall song and high-kick take well.
They would take better if the song wasn’t of such
a very brief and scrappy order. The new man,
Mr. Franklyne, becomes more and more notable
each night for a curious habit of feeling his head
thoughtfully with the point of his forefinger.
When he isn’t feeling his head he feels some other
part of him instead, but he seems to be most
interested in his head and feels it oftenest. Also,
Dot Boucicault’s great apophthegm seems to gain
weight with each new utterance, and The Bulletin
here prints it a second time that it may be a warn-
ing and an accusing voice in the ears of all men :
“It isn’t immorality that ruins a man nowadays,
but some darned foolish thing that every man
does and only one man is found out in.” How
would that sentence look on Parnell’s tombstone ?
Or perhaps Dilke might like to stick it in the
frame of his shaving-glass. He doesn’t shave, by
the way.

George Rignold’s big and commendable
iniquity is appealing to good audiences at Sydney
Her Majesty’s. Albert Marsh, when he has his
jnoustache and slouched hat on, is a thing of
beauty and a mash for ever, and a really beautiful
villain is an important consideration—in melo-
drama. Also, there is a horrid oreepiness about
nis vengeance on Mr. Plimrner, who, by the way,
nearly came to grief on the first night, for while
be was lying dead on the floor, Mr. Marsh, being
shot by the gensdarmes, fell down a stair on his
bead. There are many characters in the “King
°f Crime ” who were not noticed last week, among
fbem a bony and grasping capitalist, an unjustly
suspected seafaring person, a plaintive girl in a
green frock who has a large sum of money left
ber, and several dozen more. They all give
reasonable satisfaction, and the treasury is in a
bulged and apoplectic state in consequence.
Federal Minstrels, who used to be a
xmne of wealth to the beautiful Fred. Hiscooks,
have resurrected once more, this time at Sydney
School of Arts. They phoenixed once before, but
somehow the glory had departed and they pre-
sently dropped out of sight again. Horace Bent,
probably the most thrilling nigger in N.S.W., is
the mainstay of the show, and the story of the
Fall, told by this wild black man in a strong
rench accent, casts some entirely new lights
upon Genesis. The rest of the co. is pretty well
up to the Bent standard, and the programme is as
fresh as a minstrel programme well can be. People
who remember Mr. Hiscooks as a pleasant gentle-
man with the most lovely hair-parting in Sydney
will wish him luck in his new venture.

“The Circus Queen,” given for the first
time at Melbourne Royal, is a dramatic allegation
that Maggie Moore dances on a bare-backed steed.
Her enterprise in this direction is not made clear
to the audience, but the exterior of a tent is
visible, and she sings a “Hoop-la!” duet with the
heroic Fillis of the show, also she illustrates the
refrain by poising herself on one leg. Other mem-
bers of the troupe are a funny black acrobat
(Fred Garnet) and a clown who drinks early and
often to the memory of his lost wife. The clown,
as it happens, stole young Fillis in his infancy
from a gaudy field-marshal, whereas, Maggie,
having been rescued from a railway accident by a
demented mother, came into the circus by
mistake. The marshal adopts Miss Moore later
on, after she has suffered a term of imprisonment
in a den of thieves, so when the repentant clown
delivers Fillis back to his father, together
with a small pink frock which proves
the young man’s identity, the marshal
naturally consents to the union of these two wild
waifs, and all ends happily. The bringing forth
of the pink frock from a caravan where'it has lain
secreted for twenty long years is a delicate bit of
naturalism. One villain alone relieves the ineffable
bathos of this romance, by luring Maggie from
her horsey idol and placing her in the den afore-
said, where the demented mother does plain cook-
ing for the criminal classes. Bat after two acts
the plot loses touch of its only villain, and his
memory becomes as the shadow of an evil dream.
Maggie, moreover, seems to forget that Fillis,
disguised as Tracey the Detective, carried her
from the den. She revels in high-class society for
a long time, whilst her true lover prowls around
her new palatial residence consumed by the
belief that she is marrying the aristocracy for
money.

Played by amateurs, “ The Circus Queen ”
might win distinction as a burlesque. In the
hands of Maggie Moore, Constance Deorwyn, H.
R. Roberts, Stewart, junr., E. B. Russell and
others, who are quite desperately in earnest,
the true depth of the joke is not always under-
stood. They act with the art which conceals a
good deal of absurdity. A dozen songs,
composed by the author, are worked into the
show. Children troop upon the scene occasionally
and give it an air of “ Hans the Boatman.” The
scenery is imposing, whilst clever stage manage-
ment helps to distract attention from the author’s
heinous offence. “ The Circus Queen ” will run a
fortnight unless public opinion pronounces its
doom hastily.

At Melb. Bijou, several circumstances have
combined to make a failure of manager Garner’s
first attempt. “The Turn of the Tide” is a
brightly-written work, containing strong character
sketches, and many things worth seeing, hearing
and remembering. But it is a difficult play to do
full justice to, and the virtues of the present per-
formance have not been as generally recognised as
its faults. People leave the theatre ignorant of
the fact that they have listened to numerous
epigrams and caustic remarks, the points of which
were not driven home by the speakers. On
Saturday the strong members of the company will
have_ a chance to pull the season together in
“Friends,” adapted from the same French source
as “ Peril.” Edith Bland will undertake the lady
who nearly forgets herself, and young Diver is
engaged to act the “ cuckoo.”

Melb. Alexandra, after two nights closing
for preparations, is to re-open on Saturday with a
gorgeous stage production of Fitzgerald’s Circus
and Menagerie, under the title of “ Buoephaleon.”
Meanwhile, Dan Barry and Co. retire to Bendigo
and Ballarat previous to filling in some time at
Sydney.

Bland Holt’s largest and most expensive
spectacle appears at Melb. Princess’s on Saturday
next for the first time in Australia. Even the
“ Prodigal Daughter,” with its steeplechase and
water-jump, is a mild, commonplace matter com-
pared with “ A Life of Pleasure.” This was also
devised by the joint intellects of Pettitt and Sir
’Gustus Harris, and it is said to include a stage
army of 200 souls.
Following in the track of Madame Belle
Cole, two distinguished musical artists have just
started a series of concerts at the Town Hall.
Madame Camilla Urso, violinist, and Madame
De Vere-Sapio, operatic soprano, are recognised
stars, the former having come here this time with an
Australian reputation ready made. An orchestra
of fifty performers, or thereabouts, will serve as a
strong background for the two ladies, and Signor
Sapio will take the chair.
At Poverty Point.
Madame Rudersdorff, who was no bad judge, insisted
that Belle Cole’s voice was purely soprano.
Echel Haydon, being the daughter of a well-known
racing club secretary, is already the Sarah Bernhardt of
Melbourne’s sporting world. On the first night of
Garner's season at the Bijou, plump Alf. Joseph and his
followers vowed lustily, between the acts, that flossy
little Ethel could knock spots off Sarah B. And All.
ought to be an authority, considering his splendid literary
achievements and knowledge of “ form ” in horses.
Amy Roselle and husband Daore are the couple that
B. and B. ought to have imported some years ago. Now
that Williamson has made the engagement, the difficulty
will be to get hold of a play strong enough to show the
lady at her best. Roselle has been a good deal imitated,
whilst she herself is a considerable reproduction of Mrs.
Kendal.
George Coppin has stood “whacks” in the Maggie
Moore success at Melbourne Royal. The lady, it is said,
was invited to run the show “on her own,” but she
elected to divide the responsibility— and handsome profits,
as the result proved.

J. 0. Williamson’s recent interview with a London Era
man brought out nothing new, nor anything that wasn’t
strictly honest in the way of self-praise. “I want to im-
press upon you,” said J.C., “ that we have to produce a
play for a brief run just as expensively as it is produced
in London for a long run.” But he didn’t forget to men-
tion that, in the case of a success, frequent revivals will
bring the run up to a respectable total of weeks within a
certain term of years, so that the original cost of produc-
tion is almost as good a speculation here as in London,
where the same piece runs without a break until its popu-
larity is exhausted. The solid profits come in with the
revivals. Williamson claims fairly for the Firm: “It has
brought the Australian and the English stages into the
most intimate relationship. Throughout the hard times
of Australia we have continued to exactly reproduce
every great London success. We have kept above water ;
for the bad times are past.” Um 1
Maggie Moore’s new play is by “Tom Taylor, Esq.”
The original Tom Taylor, author of “ ’Twixt Axe and
Crown, “ Still Waters Run Deep,” and a collaborateur
with Charles Reade in more than one well-known play,
was not the Tom Taylor who devised “The Circus Queen”
and composed its music. This T.T. is a Mein, resident.
The supercilious new-chum finds reasonable excuse for
sneering now and then. Melb. Herald gravely states
that “ ‘ During Her Majesty's Pleasure’ is a sensational
drama by Mr. Inigo Tyrrell, who brought it out at the
Adelphi, in London, where it had a successful run of 12
months.” What ghastly nonsense 1
George Anson once played the part of Mr. Danby in
“Turn of the Tide,” which Harwood is now doing at
Melb. Bijou. And Harwood fairly beats the younger
comedian in this particular character, for it fits him skin-
tight.

the way. Then home and out again to Australia. Un-
speakably glad to get away from that rotten dust-heap,

The moral of “ The Bauble Shop ” is that no man, not

In latest Sporting and Dramatic, Miln writes ably of
the Napoleon drama at the Porte St. Martin, not Sardou’s
piece. Duquesne is Sardou’s Napoleon. Miln’s Bonaparte

Liverpool. Probably he meditates on Australia, with this
for a card.

The biggest English music-hall success of the day is a

A London correspondent to The Bulletin To my
mind the curiosity here at present is a lad of 14 or 15
(Cyril Tyler), who appears at the Crystal Palace concerts.
He has a soprano voice of extraordinary purity and range,
sings with little effort, and in such ditties as “ Angels
ever bright and fair,” the shadow-song from “ Dinorah,”
and the “ Last Rose of Summer,” he can “ knock spots ’
off most professional singers of the gentler sex. So far,
he has escaped the music-halls, but I don’t think for long,
as he would prove an immense “ draw.”
Mr. W. A. Holman.
Elsewhere The Bulletin prints a portrait of
that remarkable young man, Mr. W. A. Holman,
chief orator, or as Ambrose Bierce would say,
harangue-outanger, of N.S.W. Labour Electoral
League. Mr. Holman having attained a pro-
minent position in Australian Labour politics, it
follows that he is not an Australian native : he
came here from London a few years ago,
and has made with his chin a tolerably
big dent in this country. He holds in partial
solution many abstruse books, and is obviously
afflicted with literary indigestion ; likewise he has
a pretty pink and white complexion, and blushes
with great facility, but he will probably be cured
of this embarrassing habit by a year or two in
Parliament, into which he is expected by his imme-
diate friends to step over the political corpse of
G. D. Clark. Mr. Holman is a marvellously
facile and effective speaker, but he will yet live to
learn that among the most effective of Parliamen-
tary weapons are a 40-inoh stomach and a square
jaw.

This is good theoretic democracy, but it will

ha will have full power to sack all the eloquent
leaders of the movement if they loaf, or turn out
inferior boots, or begin making speeches to their
fellow-workmen during business-hours. Then the
second great essential is an honest, hard-working,
capable, but utterly unsympathetic Dutch business
manager to receive and pay and get orders, and
keep the accounts, and do office-work generally.
This individual should provide out of his salary a
substantial fidelity guarantee, and his accounts
should be checked weekly by some auditor
who has figured to advantage in the boom.
.Further, the first clause in the articles of associa-
tion should be that no man is eligible to be
a member of the committee, or the directorate,
or whatever it may be called, who has ever
made an oration on a public platform, or
otherwise manifested a desire to enter Parlia-
ment ; and the second clause should lay it
down as a cast-iron regulation that the association
wants boots, not eloquence. A committee of six
profoundly silent men, all first-class bootmakers,
should be elected to direct things for 12 months
and once every 12 months there should be a meet-
ing of all hands to receive a calm, business-like,
and absolutely unemotional report which will deal
with boots only, and contain not the slightest
allusion to the rights of man or the fundamental
principles of liberty. Anybody attempting to
deliver an impassioned address from a keg in the
yard, and refusing to get out when ordered to do
so by the Scotch overseer, should be sacked on the
instant. In short, the enterprise wants to be
started on the understanding that three things are
essential to its success, and that all these three
things are boots.

If so, safe remedies are within your reach at a
nominal cost. CLEMENTS TONIC and FLET-
CHER’S PILLS have 1 never yet failed to cure the
worst cases. General debility, nervousness,
weakness, and general complaints of the digestive
and nervous systems are promptly cured by these
reliable remedies. They are prepared by scientific
processes, and are not merely mechanical mixtures
made only to “gull the public.” The renown
CLEMENTS TONIC and FLETCHER’S PILLS
have won in Australasia is proof of the fact that
they stand pre-eminent for their special classes of
diseases. No remedies ever sold gave such entire
satisfaction to their patrons, and evidence is
forthcoming from every city, town, and village to
prove their virtues. No doubt can now exist as
to their value, but purchasers must be careful to
get the genuine articles as many unscrupulous
traders will attempt to palm off a substitute if
possible, for the sake of extra profit.

The English papers report that Albert
Edward, of Wales, nearly lost his life in a recent
railway accident at Marseilles. He had stayed
too long in the refreshment-room, and the train
started without him, and then the prince rushed
out, probably with a chop-bone in his hand,
and clutched the door of a moving carriage, which
bore him away while he made desperate but in-
effectual efforts to climb on board. Presently his
rotund person would have been knocked against
something and scraped off, but, luckily, he was
seen and the train stopped. If he hadn’t been
seen his end would have been characteristic. He
comes of a family which has always stayed too
long in the refreshment-room.

sion, and an elderly Irish lady was charged with
larceny. The evidence was clear, and the lady’s
only defence consisted of a warm appeal to the
softer aspect of the Major, on whose head she
called down blessings in a rich brogue. When she
was finished the unmoved officer sentenced her to
six months. The Irish lady looked at him for a
moment incredulously, then delivered a perora-
tion : “Meejor,” she said, sternly, “ Oi’ve a hus-
band in gaol. Me eldest son’s there, too. Me
youngest son’s drunk, so he is. Oi’ve got three
girrls that’s no better than they ought to be, but
Oi thank the Blessed Virgin that preser-rves me
that none of me family was ever in the militia.”
The Hon. “ Wully ” Swanson, of Auck-
land, M.L., is a rough old file and a born
humorist. Despite the fact that he is as homely
as they make ’em, he is the father of one of the
handsomest half-caste families in Maoriland.
When his last son was born, a congratulating
crony queried, “ And what are you going to call
him, Willie?” “Wull, I’m thenkin’ o’ callin’
him ‘Grey.’” “That will please Sir George,”
cooed his friend. “Oh! it’s na after the Gover-
nor, ye ken. I’m callin’ him ‘ Grey ’ because he’s
a meexture o’ black and white.” When a cer-
tain member with a much-distorted nose was
elected to Parliament, Swanson congratulated
him with apparently extravagant warmth, but
added, “Ye see, I’ve been the ugliest auld deevil
in the Hoosethis fifteen year, and it’s time some-
one else had a spell.”

The Free Presbyterian Synod, sitting at

bring down His wrath upon the community.”
Really it Heaven does not presently send its
wrath along in an emphatic form the parsons will
have to withdraw their support from it. A
visitation of Providence always suits the parsons’
book. “ Praise God from whom all evils flow.”
Dear Bulletin, —Your suggestion that
there should be compulsory registration of wills
which leave property away from the nearest of kin
of the testator is the law in Queensland—at any
rate, that is one of the reasons why Hon.
James Swan’s bequest of .£50,000 to the Baptist
Church was invalid. Furthermore, the Queens-
land law requires that bequests to religious bodies
and charitable institutions shall be witnessed by
three persons. Swan’s will was only witnessed by
two, and that was another cause of its invalidity.
By the way, are you aware that half of Swan’s big
bequest goes to his young widow, and that the
other .£25,000 is now going a-begging in Scotland
—at least up to latest advices no relatives of the
deceased’s father or mother had been discovered. —

Dear Bulletin, —I have been waiting for
some more energetic Dublin man to rise up and

Divinity degrees in Trinity College, Dublin.
These never were purchasable in the same way
that certain American degrees are purchasable. A
candidate for the B.D. degree must have graduated
in Arts in Dublin or one of the sister universities
—Oxford or Cambridge. I’m free to admit, how-
ever, not being a Bachelor of Divinity myself,
that a M. A.’s examination in divinity is little
more than a farce, seasoned with fees. In which
it resembled the Irish Church Establishment. —
Yours, J.C.W.

Vic. Chief Justice Madden
(remarks a Bulletin correspondent)
rose too suddenly. He was placed
at a moment’s notice over the heads
of men better than himself, he was
for a few months the recipient of the
poisonous flatteries of vice-regality,
and he got a stronger brand of
knighthood than he could drink with-
out staggering. Result is that he tries
to act up to his “position,” and,
being unfit for it, has changed from
the decent-enough fellow, with a slight
grain of coarseness, that he used to be,
into the cross between Pecksniff and
Tartuffe he appears to be now.
Sir Henry Loch should change
his name to Luck. Arriving at Mel-
bourne in the early dawn of the
“ boom,” he left before the gang were
too insolvent to shout a diamond
necklace for “ dear Lady Loch.” In
South Africa his term of office has
been glorified by the blood of many
black men, and in consideration of
the “ success ” of his real boss, Cecil
Rhodes, this fortunate old Scotchman
goes “ Home ” to get a peerage for his
valuable services to the Empire.
When Loch made a trip to London
before quitting the Victorian billet,
his mission was the obtaining of titles
for his financial friends, Matthew
Davies and Bingy Benjamin. An
unlucky man would have found his
career >. onsiderably bruised by that
painful episode, but the husband of
Lady Lytton’s twin-sister has never
been asked to explain where the
reason for Matthew and Bingy’s
knighthoods came in.

A Maoriland man is charged with an enter-
prising fraud on a fire insurance co. According to
the indictment he insured for a good sum a house
that had no existence. Then he drove a lot of
piles into the ground to represent the foundations
of a large building, charred the piles at the top to
represent the marks of the devouring element,
threw some smashed crockery about to stand for
the remains of his combusted household furniture,
and went round to collect the insurance money.
But the office noticed, in its own silent way, that
the grass was growing luxuriantly all over the site
of the conflagration, and that there were no ashes,
and the iron bedstead and the kitchen grate and
the saucepan, and the poker all had burned away
so completely that there were no signs of them
left, and it gave the insured into custody.
The S.M. Herald on the movement to
establish a N.S.W. Government clothing-factory :
But here the opening of any new' public establishment
would aggravate an evil that has already been felt, and
threatens to make itself felt more fully in the future.
Even if it cost a little more to have work for the Govern-
ment done by private hands than by servants of the State,
the money so spent would be a low price to pay for
freedom from the corrupting influences arising out of
relations between politicians and electors in the employ
of and receiving pay from the State.
Good old “ private enterprise.” In former times
the Herald used to point out . that the private
sweater should be encouraged because he was
cheaper than a State Department. And now,
when the State railways are proved to pay better
and to be worked more economically than private
lines, and the M.L. Government Insurance and
Public Trust Offices have shown that the State
can produce far better results than the private
financier, the dreary penn’orth rises to say that
cheapness doesn’t matter, and the private sweater
should be encouraged all the same.

Also, Joseph Abbott, of N.S.W., became honour-

Coxey’s array, despite its peculiar ending,
may be the first act in the realisation of Ignatius
Donnelly’s drama of “Caesar’s Column.” Walt
Whitman, a little while before his death, in a
letter to an Australian, said that when the next
danger happened to the Union, it would come
from the north-western States.
Hori Grey “ hopes that the United States
will assist Great Britain in keeping the South Sea
Islands free from European militarism.” Really ?
The petty king of Tonga some time ago advertised
in Sydney for a drill-instructor for his guard, and
every chieflet in the islands is dying to establish
an army on the European model.
Parson Daniels, a Yankee spouter
Adelaide Wesleyan Conference, suggests that
“ thousands of Japanese ” should be imported to
Australia, and thus made more accessible to con-
version.” The Bulletin, in a similar spirit, now
rises to propose that thousands of fat clergymen
be at once shipped to the Cannibal Islands.
In no province is the Labour-party becom-
ing so powerful as in Queensland. The sturdy
stand made by the little Parliamentary squad last
session, the high character of most of its members,
and their determined opposition to every piece of
Ministerial jobbery, have converted scores of
opponents into supporters.
If Bruce Smith died or went insolvent
could not his assignee or next of kin take up the
.£3OO a year member’s salary, which he has so far
declined to collect? Provision for paying such
moneys into the consolidated revenue account was
not made in the Payment of Members’ Act, as it
was not considered that any N.S.W. politician,
however bitterly opposed to the measure, would
constantly and persistently reject the coin.
Mr. Henry Parkes says (as a nasty jar for
Dibbs, who has been looking round for a place
whereon to rest his weary political feet) that he
never concurred in the policy of shifting round from
one constituency to another. How many constitu-
encies has the old man shifted from in the course
of his zigzag career ? The Bulletin remembers
eight, anyhow:—Sydney City, North Cumberland,
East Sydney, Kiama, Mudgee, Canterbury, Tenter-
field and Argyle.
The Darling Downs farmers are going
holus-bolus for the LaboUr-party. Concessions

have been created for three things. First—to
produce rent; secondly—to produce interest;
thirdly—to pay freight !”
An Argus loyal outbreak :
If 30,000 adult men can be spared for Coolgardie, cer-
tainly as many ought to be found available for action
should the English race and the British rule he ever

It the Dear Old Mother Country can afford to
starve hundreds of thousands of Britons into emi-
grating, surely she can spare enough men to mind
her own business.
The object of the Ottawa conference is to
tighten those “silken bonds ” Joseph Royal, ex-
Lieut.-Governor of the Canadian N.W. territories,
writes a book urging that it is time for Canada to
cut connection with the British Empire. The
Canadian constitution, he says, shows unequivocal
signs of insufficiency, and Canada’s interests are
naturally linked with those of the United States,
not of Britain “Imperial Federation would
mean suicide.” “The fruit of emancipation is
ripe, and we must pluck it.”
The Ottawa conference will, from an Aus-
tralian standpoint, be a huge farce, for this
country will be represented by a set of hopelessly
commonplace political duffers. Not one man in
the whole gang would be trusted here to speak on
behalf of Australia in any matter more important
than a bottle of gingerbeer. Yet mischief may
come out of this business—as when the spineless
Jennings and the clumsy Wisdom represented
N.S.W. at the naval tribute conference in London.
It would appear that two or three hundred
pounds or more were paid to some Signor or other
by N.S.W. Govt.—of course, under the Parkes
high-art regime, for a painting to decorate an
Australian exhibition court in London, and that
this painting, after being shown at Adelaide exhi-
bition under the auspices of Jawbone Neild, was
disposed of “ with other rubbish ” and subse-
quently found its way to Sydney, where it was
traded to some attorney or other for ten or twelve
pounds.
The Argus has interviewed the rampant
female, a prominent lady of the leagues, who
believes that the henfranchised She will abolish
payment of members, because it “leads to men
going into Parliament to suit their own pockets.”
She considers honour and glory quite sufficient
recompense for any M.P. Perhaps it is, but then
the country can’t afford it. The “honour and
glory ” M.P. is like the average woman at a tea-
fight—it isn’t what he consumes that costs, but
what he carries away.
The State must bear the burden of its
criminals, but the whole burden should not rest on
the poorest of the citizens. It is a miserable thing
for the Yic. Penal Department to cut down stone-
breaking prices with the deliberate intention of
getting the job merely so that prisoners shall not
be idle. Inspector-General Evans has been tout-
ing for orders persistently for months past. So
long as the work means, as it undoubtedly does, a
few shillings a day to hundreds of necessitous and
honest men, Mr. Evans should be allowed to tout
in vain.

“ This Parliament is the worst we’ve ever
had,” is the burden of the political song in every
Australian province. But everyone who consults
old files will find that the same words did duty in
the latter days of every Parliament during the
last thirty or forty years. The sentiment con-
veyed is akin to that expressed by the resident of
many years standing who “ never saw such rain
this last five-and-thirty years,” or who “never,
and I’m in this street now going on twenty-five
years, experienced such heat.”
Minister Webb (Vic.): “In the U.S.A.
the Chief Justice of that vast population gets a
salary of only £2200 a year, whdst the Chief
Justice of Victoria gets £3500. If the people
thought the Government could continue to do
that sort of thing he did not agree with them.’
In the States the President of GO millions of
people gets exactly the sum paid to Hopetoun for
acting as Governor to one million of population,
most of whom don’t approve of his presence in the
country. So if there be any force in Webbs
statistics, the noble Earl ought to rub along on
.£166 13s. 4d. per annum, or thereabouts.
Dear Bulletin, — Be your par. about the
poor Q. Labour-member who renewed a <£2o bill,
Jet me point out tliat many years ago I was
indebted for hospitality to his English relatives.
When he got into debt because his Radical prin-
ciples kept him out of employment, I took a bill
of sale over his poor chattels, not for my profit,
but for his protection. He is secure from any
pressure while I live, and will be released when I
die. I am not a shark, or a Philistine, but only
an old Highlander with some sympathy for a
friend in need. — The Bill Discounter.
Justice becomes more and more smothered
by the technicalities of the law. For instance,
a Dunedin (M.L.) publican was proved the
other day to have sold beer to a person under
the specified age. Then the defendant’s lawyer
rose and pointed out that the law prohibited the
sale of “ liquors ” to children ; but that beer was
only one liquor, and, therefore, the case didn t
come under the Act. The bench was so much
staggered at this view that it hung up the case
indefinitely. Every day a few new technical
objections of this sort are rooted out, so that
presently there won’t be a workable law left in
any of the statute books.
The played-out Parkes feebly endeavours
to dig up his ancient Kiama ghost for service at
next N.S.W. general election. The ghost isn t
by any means what it used to be, but it is
evidently going to be dragged round for all it is
worth, with the assistance of the Freetrade press.
Parkes never learns anything, and often forgets
something. If he lived till all the churches were
dead and all the creeds were forgotten, he
would point out, for the millionth time, that
the Lord took a special interest in imported slon
clothes, and that there was Joy in Heaven when
times were brisk with the flaring oleograph made
in Germany.
One hundred excited British females,
bossed by the cranky Lady Somerset, are about to
start round the world to get 2,000,000 signatures
to a gigantic petition demanding the immediate
abolition of all kinds of alcohol everywhere, which
petition is afterwards to be presented to all the
rulers of the world. If, out of all the earth’s
population, they can only collect 2,000,000
signatures, which seems to be the limit of their
expectations, then teetotalism is dead. The
Bulletin, if allowed liberal expenses, could get
far more signatures than that to a petition demand-
ing that Queen Victoria should henceforth always
wear a feather in her left ear.
The blessings of having a Privy Council
to appeal to come out strong in the case of the
Creswick (Vic.) Shire Council. That body was
ordered to pay £4O damages to one Barry, and
being in a warlike mood it appealed to the
Supreme Court, which confirmed the judgment.
Then it argued before the Full Court on the
subject, and lost again. After that it carried the
matter to the Privy Council, and lost a third
time. The Council’s costs are ,£l2OO, and Barry’s,
over and above his £4O verdict, are probably at
least £lOO. If the Council had won the case on
appeal its own share of the appeal expenses would
till have been far more than the amount of the
disputed verdict, so it wad really.fighting for puro~
devilment. This Is the sort of thing which makes
any plain, Ordinary, person yearn to kids the
palladium ol British freedom light faff thd
premises.
Q. Labour-party isn’t sura enough about
Glassey’a success for the Burke to risk a conflict
with Lissner and Little. Glassey would be glad
enough to take the seat unopposed, but, like
Lilley, he doesn't want a repetition of N. Bris-
bane. So Hoolan takes back his resignation,
which luckily never got out of the hands of the
A.L.F. secretary, and accounts for the com-
plication, to wit: “ I can’t offer Glassey a
seat on a shovel; and, if he does not accept,
throw it at him.” It is just as well things turn
out thus; for while the struggle between North
and South continues no Northern constituency
can be adequately represented by a Southern
candidate.
Robert Reid, the Victorian soft-goods
person, announces that “We ” are “not afraid of
a hostile visit from the navy of any of the
European powers.” If they came, however,
“we” would “know how to deal with them.’
This is just one more of the many ways in which
this parochial bore is making a fool of him-
self and his country. “We” certainly are not
afraid of any European navy, just as we are nob
afraid of cholera, the devil, the Pope or the
bunyip, because we never think seriously about
any of them. But if one of these European
navies did come along with hostile intent there is
very little doubt how we would deal with it —there
would simply be the wildest, maddest stampede for
Thargomindah that the mind of man can conceive,
and Robert Reid would be found insensible on the
road where he had dropped from sheer exhaustion.
The spectacle of this' flabby, unwarlike draper
defying the navies of Europe because he knows
they aren’t coming is an awful thing to look at,
and is painfully suggestive of the man who stood
on a mountain top and shook his whitewash-brush
at a whale.
Sixteen new lawyers just admitted by Vic.
Supreme Court. Sixteen new colonies of vari-
ously-fanged microbes inoculated into the Vic-
torian body corporate. Sixteen new oaths of
allegiance to a possible oversea enemy of the
people. Sixteen new bandit costs-merchants, who
will literally use their right to scrape the bones of
those unfortunates who happen to have grievances
or make mistakes. But possibly a friend of the
people may be amongst them, as has happened ere
now. Is it not time that this “allegiance” busi-
ness were stopped, so as to obviate the conflict
between oath and duty? It is not necessary in
the other professions, except the man-butchering,
and why should it continue in the legal ? There
are more snares laid for democracy than it wots of.
The Bulletin believes a Parliamentary
Hansard to be an absolute necessity in the
interests of honesty. But it is ghastly to read in
it this sort of thing :
Mr. Rose: I am sure that the hon. member will not
understand anything about moral obligations.
Mr. Crick: I know what the hon. member’s object is
to-night.
Mr. Rose: I can face the hon. member, or anybody else,
and I do not care three straws for him or anybody else.
Mr. Crick: The hon. member wants to save his political
hash.
Mr. Rose: The hon. member has not one to save—the
hon. member was crushed long ago.
Mr. Crick ; The hon. member is dead already.
Mr. Rose: I shall, perhaps, live to bury the hon. member.
Mr. Crick : The hon. member is a paid advocate.
Mr. Rose: What is the good of calling me a paid advo-
cate? I have done my duty.
At a recent Wellington (M.L.) unemployed
meeting, a wooden-legged man said he had been
offered a job—digging a garden !
THE VOICE OF THE JACKASS.
’Tis the voice of the Fat Man—it wandereth by,
And it drivels of thrift, of demand and supply ;
“ If millions we’re owing,” he tells us, “ ’tis plain
There’s only one remedy—Borrow again ! ”
If thousands are begging for bread at the door,
“To China and bring in a few thousands more—
For our soil is superb and our prospects are
grand ”
OI the voice of the Jackass is loud in the land!
The Public (God bless it!) is led by the nose,
And it loveth to bellow wherever it goes;
’Twill roar itself hoarse for a pug or a peer
For “Wiggles and Whisky,” for “Boodle and
Beer; ”
’Twill ring out a rousing “ Hip, hip, hip hurrah !”
For a prig or a prince—for a show or a Shah ;
But why it should cheer very few understand —
01 the voice of the Jackass is loud in the land/
Our parsons are prosing of Peter and Paul,
Of Man as he was at the Flood and the Fall,
Of the World of the Past with its “Light and its
Way! ”
(Forgetting what we want is light for to-day);
Our learned professors right deeply are read
In the fictions that live and the tongues that
are dead,
And they prate and expound, and they puff and
expand—
-01 the voice of the Jackass is loud in the loud 1
’Tis the voice of the Loyalist—this is his wheeze—
“ Up—up with the flag! Let it float on the
breeze !
We love it because —(we’ve no reason to give)—
And the landlord wo love—for he letteth us live;
We are ready with rifle and bay’net and brand
To shed the best blood in a stream on the strand,
And we’d shoot our own brothers at word of
command ”
0! the voice of the Jackass is loud in the land!
So whenever the men who are mighty of jaw
Preach “Property—Property—Order and Law ! ”
And whenever the press bids the poor and forlorn
“ Rejoice—for a fresh Royal pauper is born ! ”
And whenever they tell us—“’Tis easy to see
That the land where you starve is the Land of the
Free,”
Let us say as we list to the barren-pate band :
“O! the voice of the Jackass is loud in the land!”

“ When a layman advocates his own cause
in a law-court,” said an ex-Judge the other day,
“ the combined professional instincts of Bench
and Bar are aroused. Both endeavour to per-
petuate the maxim that a client who is his own
lawyer is a fool. The sentiment which operates
is merely the dictate of the law of self-preserva-
tion, for if one layman wins, two may win, dozens
may win, and the year in which a dozen laymen
win before juries will sound the death-knell of
the Bar’s existence. Judges are still barristers ;
they can (and occasionallydo)throwuptheir Judge-
ships and go again to the table, and, therefore,
their interest in the question is a living one.”

Dear Bulletin, —“ Bluebeard ” notices
the cry of an “ advanced ” woman for equal sexual
privileges. Does the “advanced” woman think
she can change her conformation by changing
petticoats for pants? She docs think so? Then
she was born with several stages of the change
accomplished. The real woman— i.e., the abso-
lutely feminine (bearing) woman who alone is
valuable to the world—doesn’t want a vote, nor
man-pants, tier equal sexual privileges either. The
average “leading” woman’s righter has a pro-
nounced beard and a voice like a fish-vendor
crying in a cellar. —Yours, The Reckless.

A somewhat historical Victorian diamond
necklet, which originally cost quite a thou-
sand rounds, lately found its way to a city
pawnshop for .£l5O, and when the pledge fell
due the other day Abraham “copped” it. Its
next appearance will probably be on the
he iving breast of Rebecca.

Dear Bulletin, —Dr. “ Brigham Brown ”
says “the suicide has no choice in the matter.”
Well, nobody has any choice in any matter!
What he thinks his “choice” is simply the inevit-
ableness of things. Average humanity can’t
divest itself of the notion that it is somehow a
worker-out of the problem in which it is merely a
fictor. Even a Madden is no more than a help-
less result of the forces which ordain that he shall
make his face as fantastic as his logic!—
Necessity.

“ There is one
class of labourers
who never strike,
and seldom com-
plain. They get up
at five o’clock in the
morning, go to bed
at 11 or 12 at night.
They die in harness,
arid are supplanted
as quickly as may
be. The-e are the
house-keeping wives
of labouring men.”

Do we all do it 1
The publican keeps
a side-door open on
Sundays, and hon-
oured guests are
made welcome to big
little back parlour.
“I’m strictly Sab-
batarian,” he says,
“in the sense that
I’d like to shut up
and go for a drive ;
but if I don’t servo
my customers they’ll
go elsewhere and
I’ll lose my con-
nection.” So his
front door is left to
observe the Sab-
bath. A Sabba-
tarian Australian
daily newspaper,
which denounces
this lack of ingenu-
ousness on the part
of the public, opens
its front door for a
brief space on Sun-
day night, purely
for the convenience
of the advertising
public, but if you
want a shilling’s-
worth before the
front door opens,
you can have it by
going in a side-door
round the corner.
There again the
front door observes
the Sabbath.
Editor Bulletin, —lf Polygamy is ever to
oe introduced, as suggested by Dr. Brigham
Brown, it will be necessary to adopt at the same
time the law of Islam which gives the wife a
distinct civil status, instead of merging her in-
dividuality in that of her husband. The Mussul-
man wife has just the same rights as her husband,
who is legally bound, without any settlement, to
give her a certain establishment. Her dowry is
her own property, and if she is divorced or
divorces herself, she takes it back with her. She
can exclude her husband at will from her apart-
ment in the harem. Even if a man marries a
slave-girl, she becomes free and acquires aright to
a certain amount of property fixed by law. Wives
are expensive luxuries in all Muhamadan countries,
and there no man can live on the produce of their
labour. The poor man is always monogamous in
spite of the nonsense talked and written by the
missionaries.— Zabardast Khan.
In two recent cases of burglary from Mel-
bourne churches, petticoats were amongst the
articles reported missing, no less than 13 having
been secured by the professional who looted the
Baptist tabernacle at Kew. When the churches
lose the petticoats they are indeed doomed.

A South Melbourne doctor, the other day,
divorced twins who were born attached to one
another by a ligature. How will the churches
take this act of impiety ! “ Those whom the Lord
hath joined together let no man put asunder.”

Dear Bulletin, —An Adelaide magnate
sent a labourer up to work in his hills garden.
Finding no sleeping accommodation, the man
wired ; “ Where do I sleep?” This is Croesus’
reply verbatim: “Empty packing-case today’s
train, fill straw, place stable.” Where does that
chap come in the mean man’s competition?—
Walt.

Adelaide is called the “Place of Churches ”
and the “ Holy City,” while Melbourne is rather
proud of areputation for luxurious iniquity. It is
a fact, however, that for lt> years Public Museum,
Library and Art Gallery have been open in
DAN THE DROVER : “I remember there was four of us sat down to play
euchre last night, an’ I remember, out of the four of us, there
wor Duffy, an’ Phil M‘Genn an’ Long Nod, but who th’ blazes
the fourth cove was I can’t remember.”
Adelaide on Sunday, although they have been
kept hermetically sealed in Melbourne ; that Vic-
toria passed special legislation to stop the publica-
tion of a Sunday paper; and that now South
Australia’s desire to run express trains through to
Melbourne on Saturdays and Sundays to carry
mails and passengers is burked by the too-aggres-
sive Sabbatarianism of Oalvin-ruled, hypocritical
Melbourne.

Two or three N.S.W. Labour members
favour the arming of the police. Two of them
thought it “ought to have been done years ago.”
Why ? The revolver is useless, or worse, ac close
quarters. It gives a false sense of security to a
timid man, and a brave one will not attempt to
use it till it is too late.
S.M. Herald considers thafc the Parra-
matta Adventists, lately fined for working in their
gardens on Sunday, may have been a cause of
offence to their neighbours by making a noise, and
argues that everyone is entitled to have his Day
of Rest undisturbed. What does the Herald say
to the clanging of church bells on Sunday? Can
the people who live in the vicinity of a bell-tower
enjoy their Day of Rest undisturbed? It is told
in connection with a fashionable Sydney ohuroh
UNPALATABLE.
GOSTPEL-AGENT (at the grave of his predecessor) : “Poor fellow! He was
greatly liked, I suppose, by your people.”
CANNIBAL BRLLE (taken off her guard): “No fear ! Him drefful
tough.”
l h ifc a man pleaded to have the bells cease clanging
while his wife was undergoing a critical surgical
operation within fifty yards of the church, and
that he was repulsed. Why not bring church
bell-pushes to court ?

One Australian Public Works Department
evidently cannot repose much trust in its officers.
Nobody is allowed to leave the building with a
parcel of any sort without first showing the care-
taker its contents. Also a detective has been
shadowing several officers suspected of having had
dealings with the appellant in a big arbitration
which went against the department.
* * *
Mrs. Lane has returned to Australia to
“ organise female recruits for the Paraguayan
settlement.” As New Australia is to be “strict
teetotal,” The Bulletin suggests that Mrs. L.
should clear out the Women’s Christian Temper-
ance Union as a special line.
An alleged church-robber arrested in Mel-
bourne the other day attracted the suspicions of
the officiating policeman by publicly giving
eighteenpence to beggars. It has come to this,
that the man who gives more than a copper to a
Melbourne “beat” runs the risk of being “reason-
ably supposed” to be a burglar. This is what
makes the Thrift party so careful,
* * *
The doctors at Wangaratta (Vic.) Hospital
have, after a most delicate operation, succeeded in
saving the life of a Swiss named Kirtz, who
attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head.
He will be arraigned for his offence when he re-
covers. Starving to death is the only form of
suicide allowed to Victorian citizens.

Most wise Judge Madden’s recent queer
pronouncement re the abandoned rascal who
marries a woman “ simply to make a convenience
of her” and then basely deserts her is still exercis-
ing people’s minds. Mr. Madden has an in-
growing baldness : he ascribes this dreadful state
of things, in a devious, incomprehensible way, to
the Shiels Divorce Act, which really merely
enables the woman to escape from the lascivious
miscreant who has overcome her scruples with the
assistance of the parson. These preachy lapses
are as uncomplimentary to his Honor’s moral
sense as to his logic. Evidently, it is not the
iniquity of the selfish and sacrilegious villain who
uses the Church as a procuress that inspires the
Judge’s funny diatribes and pursy anguish, so
much as the society-cursed act of divorce. He
would rather riay[the man than divorce the woman.
Maoriland has a lady, Mrs. Yates, as
Mayor of Onehunga } and a lady M.D., Dr.
Frikart, in practice at Wellington. Miss Lillian
Edgar is on the Auckland University College
council, and at the recent annual election of school-
committees, a long stride was taken at Whanga-
poua, for of the seven members there elected three
were ladies—one of whom was afterwards chosen
as President of Committee,
In Victoria it is
optional for constables to
fire-arm themselves. A
majority show their
courage by not carrying
revolvers, which might
shoot innocent people,
and their caution by
avoiding the danger of
shooting themselves.

They do things in
their own way in North-
ern N.S. Wales. Once a
local widower, rich and
kind, gave a ball. All
went merrily till la.m.,
when alone in the bright
ball-room’ the widower
host sat lost in thought.
He blinked, he winked,
he fell asleep, and slept
for half -an - hour. He
woke, looked athiswatch,
ran into a back room,
took up a large bell, and
running out upon the
garden steps, furiously
rang for ten minutes This
he did once, twice, thrice.
Then he swore lie wouldn't
stand it and went to bed.
H.df-an-hour after three
scire of couples came into
the supper-room, and (10
men waited upon the host
and explained that each
expect) d all the others tjp
respond to the bell. It
was only a little miscon-
ception.

The exorbitant charge of one of the cap-and-

A BUNCH OF ROSES.
Roses ruddy and roses white,
What are the joys that my hearfdisoloses I
Sitting alone in trie fading light
Memories come to me here to-night
With the wonderful scent of the big red roses.
Memories come as the daylight fades
Down on the hearth where the firelight dozes;
Flicker and flutter the lights and shades,
And I see the face of a queen of maids
Whose memory comes with the scent of roses.
Visions arise of a scene of mirth
And a ball-room belle that superbly poses—
A queenly woman of queenly worth,
And I am the happiest man on earth
With a single flower from a bunch of roses.
Only her memory lives to-night—
God in His wisdom her young life closes ;
Over her grave may the turf lie light,
Cover her coffin with roses white—
She was always fond of the big white roses.
Such are the visions that fade away—•
Man proposes and God disposes ;
Look in the glass and I see to-day
Only an old man, worn and gray,
Bending his head to a bunch of roses.

A CANVAS.
A child’s face, small and grave,
With wind-blown hair.
Brown, with a laugh in it,
Sweet eyes that stare
Out of the canvas. Lips
Childishly red,
But dropped with giief as if
For early bed.
Ever the eyes smile out
To me below
Ever the grieved lips droop
As if they know
How quiet I am alone.
There is a chair—
The lamp-light leaves it out,
But it is there.
The shadows make it black
And large. I know
How very small it is
And very low.
The lamp-light does not reach
The cup and plate,
The doll without a head,
The small, smeared slate.
But it falls on the wall’s
One pictured place.
Oh, child-soft hair and lips !
Oh, little face!

rrHOSE who wish to marry according Jewish rites,
i and cannot do so in the great Synagogues on
account of heavy expense, can marry for 10s. 6d., as
fn London, by RABBI HIRSCHOWITZ Authorised
Minister of Beth-Hamedrash, 212 Madehne-street,
Carlton.
A Sydney paper heads the announcement
of the arrest of a third man for the Barraba
murder, “ Clever Investigation by the 1 oboe.
Where the cleverness comes in does not appear.
The man had been seen by 11 policemen, six ot
whom supplied him with food, and none ot e
thought of suspecting him till a Sydney deteo.ive
came along. In the same fashion the two con
stables King got great kudos for the capture o
the Dora Dora black Bulyal; while had it not
been for Capt. Leftwych, of the Mackay schooner
Petrel, the black would be at large still. Un dUtn
Jan., Leftwych saw Bulyal on Pigeon Island, near
Stewart’s Peninsula. He got on to the main-
land, and walked to St. Helen’s cattle-station,
where he thought the Kings were, but found that
they had left on their way to Bowen, intending to
search the country further north, thus leaving
Bulyal behind them. They were brought back,
and after other aboriginals had been bribed to
make Bulyal drunk, that wretched half-starved
nigger was triumphantly arrested, loaded with
chains and hand cuffs, and landed in gaol. Had
Leftwych not gone after the Kings, Bulyal would
have escaped to an island in Whitsunday Passage,
30 miles from the mainland ; and the police won
now have been fruitlesslyscounngthecountry some-
where about Cooktown. If there is ever a police
capture where 90 per cent, of the credi is
earned by good old “ information received, iHE
Bulletin wants to hear about it.
Dear Bulletin, — Be death-adders. What
ignorant, old bushmen mistake for a “sting is
merely the last joint of the spine which is un-
covered, and instead of being IJm. long, as
“Joynt M'Ginnis ” foolishly supposes, seldom or
never attains a length greater than 3-Bths of an
inch. In the death adder ( acanthophis antarctica)
this uncovered spinal termination projects from
the upper part of the extremity of the tail, and ia
always curved in the same manner as Pitmans
letter M. In other Australian snakes in which
this uncovered prolongation of the spine occurs
this so-called “sting” projects from the centre of
the extreme end of the tail, and is_ per-
fectly straight. Examples of this will be
met with in the blind snakes (Typhlops
nigrescens and Typhlops rueppelli yar.J. On
many occasions, to prove my belief in scientific
teaching and my utter contempt for bushman s
blatherskite, I have pricked my hands and drawn
blood with the so-called “ stings ” of living death-
adders, and I am ready and willing to repeat the
experiment in the presence of the whole of Jhb
Bulletin staff if requested to do so by the editor.
I cannot but notice that there is one trifling
difference between Mr. “Joynt M‘Ginnis and
me, to wit, that he doesn’t know what he is
talking about and I do. When he speaks of
having killed in New England a death-adder
“over 4ft. long” his ignorance of Australian
ophidians fairly bubbles over, and discloses the
fact that he doesn’t know what a death-adder
is. No death-adder ( Acanthophis antarctica )
ever attained, or is ever likely to attain, a
greater length than 32in.; and for every one
that goes over 29in. it is possible to find 300 that
don’t. Therefore, the reptile this person, who
hides his identity under the alias of “ Joynt
M'Ginnis,” refers to must have been a variety of
the tiger-snake ( Hoplocephalus curtus var.), and
wasn’t a death adder at all, and had no prong or
“ sting ” in its tail (as none of this genus has), and
did not drive its sting in the pup’s nose, and the
pup didn’t die, and the snake wasn’t killed, and
the whole yarn ends abruptly in some sheep-
hurdles and a small boy and a man whose
name isn't M'Ginnis. Death adders are not
scarce. Even right alongside of Sydney they
are plentiful, as for example at Rand-
wick, Coogee, Botany, and Mount Rennie.
I never yet met a bushman who could tell one
snake from another. Always blathering, always
over-confident, and always argumentatively aggres-
sive when arraigned at the bar of_ science, he
knows less than nothing. And in this connection
the term “bushman” is intended to apply to
well-educated, shrewd business men. With bush-
men, a snake is a snake and nothing more, but
their snake often turns out to be a legless lizard,
such, for example, as Lialis hurtoni, Pygopus sp.,
Ddma impar, D. fraseri and other lacertilian rep-
tiles, The tiger snake and death adder are fre-
quently confounded by bushmen, notwithstanding
that in the former the scales are in 18 rows
anteriorly and 19 posteriorly and all thesnbcaudal
plates entire , while in the latter the scales are
in 21 rows and all the sub-oaudals divided.
Just one word more re death adders. “ Joynt
M'G.’s” sententious remark that “if the adder
had bitten him (the pup), there would have been
two marks,” is entirely wrong. Australian snakes
generally leave four distinct punctures, owing to
the fact that they nearly all possess a pair of well-
developed subsidiary fangs. And it is quite
possible for a snake to leave only one puncture
and still kill its victim, owing to the breakage of
one of the first fangs and the non-development
of subsidiary ones. It is quite common to
find venomous snakes with four well-developed
fangs, and, for accidental reasons, with only one.
Three fangs, one on one side of the head and two
on the other, are frequently met with, especially
in the brown snake (Diemenia superciliosa) and the
black snake (Pseudechis porphrincus) and these are
sometimes found in a transverse line, thus : . ..
More frequently, of course, they appear one
behind the other in vertical lines, thus: : :
And when they are three, thus : . : The
vulgar old English notion that venomous snakes
imly leave two punctures has, as far as Australian
snakes are concerned, been exploded years ago.
With one or two trifling exceptions our snakes are
as distinctly characteristic and as essentially Aus-
tralian as our ornithology and our mammalia, and
I’m glad of it. Theonly “great English scientist”
who did anything like justice to our snakes was a
German named Gerard Krefft. I’m not snake-
hungry, but if “Joynt MGinnis,” or anyone else
can show me a death-adder (Acanthophis antarctica)
“ over 4ft. long with a sting on him . . about
long ” I’m quite prepared to sib down and eat
it.—l am, &c., H. J. M'Cooey,
There is much “ discursive nebulosity ” in
Kipling’s latest yarn, “Kaa’s Hunting.” The
hero is referred to as a wolf-cub and as a man-cub,
and the evidence in favour of both is so strong
that probably nobody bub the great Rudyard
knows whether it is a boy or a young wolf. The
later stories of this young man show up very badly
against his ante-boom works, and the doom of
Rider Haggard, Slavin, and other bust-up
divinities seems to cast its shadow before the
clever Jingoist.
“ II the figures from Hong Kong and Manilla were
added we could give notice of approaching typhoons in

BECAUSE!

I did not love her for her land,
Her pelf, and pedigree,
The wealth within her lily hand
Had ne’er a charm for me ;
’Twas not because her teeth were pearls,
Each ear a dainty shell,
’Twas not because her rippling curls
In waves of ebon fell;
’Twas not because the words she breathed
Could soul and sense beguile,
’Twas not because her face she wreathed
In many a dimpling smile ;
’Twas not because her eyes were clear
As some pellucid pool;
’Twas not for these I held her dear
And loved her regal rule ;
’Twas only just (come —lend your ear)
Because I was a fool /

A GOOD STOVE.
A WORD OF CAUTION.
Everyone knows what a good stove is at least,
the women do ; and every woman knows that, of
all the treasures of the household, a really first-
rate, reliable cooking-stove is the greatest desider-
atum in a house. A great many stoves are
advertised every year, many of which are like
jerry built houses —thrown together to sell. A
word of caution is therefore necessary to intending
buyers, because there are few things so annoying
and vexatious as to buy a stove and then find that
it does not possess all the qualities that are neces-
sary to give complete and lasting satisfaction.
Now, the points in choosing a good stove are;—
1. Strong cast-iron frame.
2. Good draught.
3. Facilities to burn either wood, coal, or
even turf.
4. Simplicity of parts, and thus, easy to clean.
5. Duplicate parts kept in stock, so that
breakages can be replaced at small cost
and without delay.
And if, in addition to these five points, you can
get a stove that is also an ornament to the kitchen,
all the better.
Price, of course, is a point, but that is a matter
which need scarcely be mentioned, since, if the
above points are combined in any stove, it would
be cheap at any price within reason.
It only remains for us to say that, with con-
fidence, we can honestly recommend “The
Housewife,” sold by Holdsworth, Macpherson
and Co., 250 George-street, Sydney, from <£3 10s.

We should suggest our readers writing to this
firm for an illustrated catalogue, with further
particulars.
Send your figures from Hong Kong,
We will straightway wire along—
We swear it by Thermometer and “ Glass” —
A notice of the day,
When, without a doubt, your way
A thund’ring big typhoon is sure to pass.
By your Joss and sacred flag
Just depend on Clement Wragge,
He’ll let you know in plenty time—alas !
Oh ! we here mean what we sing
For we know our weather-king ;
He always tells Australia in advance
When wet weather is to be;
To escape from his decree
We never get the spectre of a chance,
Ere we’re wetter than a shag.
We think hard of Clement Wragge,
We could paralyse “ his nibs ” with half a glance
So our fondest hope is this :
That our weather he will miss
When his eye is on the Northern Hemisphere,
Knowing nought of storms to be
We’ll live days of careless glee
When the weather’s not at all inclement here.
Oh ! we’ll pack our picnic swag
All in spite of Clement Wragge,
And if disappointed solace up with beer.
On the other hand again,
Sickly, premature and vain,
Our fondest hope to Hades may be hurled—
To our prophet, some folks say,
It is merely infant’s play
To see China when in bed he’s snugly curled —
And perhaps we’ll have to brag
On some future day of Wragge,
Who prepares the weather forecast for the world.

The Wild-Cat Column.
Melbourne re-constructed bank shareholders are'
beginning to demand that those portions of the reoon-
Swindle agreements which relate to calls should be fixed
on a new basis. They want fewer calls and longer inter-
vals between them. This is interesting news for the-
depositors. These suffering persons allowed their money
to be reflxed for long periods, on the solemn assurance-
that they were to get further security in the shape of a.
larger paid up capital, and most of the banks went through
the hollow formality of making eight or ten calls, spread
over a aeries of years. Now, one of these calls has been
paid, and the second is due, or in arrear, or in process of
payment, and already a large section of shareholders are-
devising ways and means for repudiating their end of the
trouble and breaking their promise to the depositors.
Their ostensible plea is that the money called up can’t be
“ profitably employed ” at present. The idea that it.
might be profitably employed in paying off a few old
debts isn’t taken into account.
Meanwhile, the seamy side of the reconstruction
game threatens to turn up in an unexpected fashion.
There are signs on the financial horizon that money is
going to be cheaper than it ever was in Australia before,
and the banks which joyously fixed many millions for a
long term of years at 4£ per cent, already begin to fear
that rates will be down to SJ.per cent. long before the
term expires, and that their deposits will presently be a
dead weight on their souls. A few will solve the problem
by simply paying off their depositors, but others are
loaded up with dead and unrealisabie “ securities ” and
can’t do this. Therefore, more reconstruction is a possi-
bility of the near future,
♦ • « •
This is the one fact concerning the bank recon-
struction business which wants to be driven into the
public intelligence with a hammer until the slow-thinking
multitude gets hold of it in ail its bearings. The suspen-
sions did very little damage to the great bulk of the bank
investments, for most of the depreciation had taken place
before the great 1893 burst. Therefore, when a bank
which professed to be earning 10 or 12 per cent, before it
suspended is now earning 2 or 3, it is fifty chances to one
that the 10 or 12 per cent, was a lie, and was made up by
charging interest that was irrecoverable on money that
was hopelessly lost. Also, when the interest earned goes
down in this awful fashion without any corresponding
reduction in the alleged assets, it is fifty chances to one
that the present accounts are a lie also; and the only
change for the better is that, whereas the old balance-
sheet took credit both for the principal that was lost and
the interest that wasn’t received, the new one takes
credit only for the lost principal. Further, when the
same old board, which claimed that everything was
happy and prosperous right up to the smash, remains in
power, the chance that the accounts wifi be anything else
but a lie is exceedingly limited.
* • * «
The liquidators of the Bank of South Australia
threaten a call of £l5 per share. This institution amal-
gamated with the Union, which undertook to liquidate
its affairs and pay the value of the assets in its own
shares. During the process of liquidation, however,
things have gone from bad to worse until the profoundly
dismal result has been arrived at that there are really no
assets at.all. The B. of S.A.’s capital of £BOO,OOO, and
reserve of £130,000 had both disappeared, and now the
Union wants £340,000 from the shareholders to make up
the further deficiency. This is probably about the most
solemn banking situation in these provinces.
• • • ,•
TheN.Z. Loan and Mercantile enquiry ended
in a scathing deliverance by the British Judge and much
combustible language by the London papers. According
to the Judge, the later balance-sheets were misleading,
and a policy of wilful suppression was followed for the
express purpose of deceiving the shareholders. The
Times describes the whole business as “ a gigantic system
of continued and complicated dishonesty,” and the Daily
Chronicle talks in an off-hand and matter-of-course
fashion about the prosecution of the directors. It this
sort of thing occurs to the comparatively hon'est and res-
pectable Loan and Mercantile, what would have happened
to a lot of the Australian banks if their directors had
been examined in like fashion ? As one local magnate
cheerfully acknowledged, a general enquiry would ruin
everything, or words to that effect. Considering the awful
consequences wherever there has been an enquiry, it seems
•quite likely.

There are already in operation several country
agencies for nullifying the N.S. W. Bank Notes Act, which
makes notes legal tender except in Sydney. Storekeepers
collect the notes in a country township and send them to
Sydney to be changed into gold, which is returned to the
senders. The charge for carriage and insurance is trifling,
and people are happy in the thought that they have
money in their pockets instead of what at any time may
be waste paper.

Judge Holroyd has “a strong impression that
the Federal Bank was used by a majority at least of the
directors for their own convenience, and that of their
friends, without regard to the interests of the great body
of shareholders, and that the system on which its busi-
ness was conducted, at least towards the end of its career,
was thoroughly unsound.” How about the interests of
depositors? Shareholders in a bank are directly respon-
sible for the directors, whereas depositors invest their
money on the strength of the bank’s character. It can
be easily shown that depositors trust shareholders to look
after their own directorate, although all trust in banks
must be blind until a full list of shareholders, with the
number of shares held by each, is displayed at the head
office. The share-ledger should be posted for the public
benefit, not stuck away in an inner office.

Many Melb. Metropolitan Gas Co. employes
are now getting less salary than they drew ten years ago.
Such men as collectors have suffered three reductions
within a short period, one of which reductions was equal
to all the amount of increases made on their weekly wage
since 1884. This to secure a sinful dividend of 14 per
cent, on the watered stock, and to placate the idiot who,
having bought his shares on a basis of 20 per cent, divs.,
considers himself a martyr when his accursed spec, is
turning out badly. A real, effectual, all-round gas strike,
from stokers to office-clerks, would at the present time
be exulted over by the general public, even though the
shopkeepers might whine, for private consumers only
want a little encouragement to adopt kerosene en masse.
Then the fire-insurance companies would come along in
mortal terror and petition Parliament to make the bloated
gas monopoly give good value for its money, or, anyway,
something of a pleasing and satisfactory nature would
shortly ensue.

Dear Bulletin, —You had a paragraph the
other day indirectly impugning the business reliability of
German Jews. In my experience the slur was undeserved.
Some of the best men of my acquaintance, either as
traders or as citizens, have been Hebrews with Teutonic
names. After recent Victorian disclosures, you might
fairly gibbet Scotchmen as the boss rogues and hypocrites
of this hemisphere.—Thine, Turn Piripi.

Editor Bulletin. —Re the implication that had
there been two officers at Barraba bank the manager
might not have been murdered: It is well known in the

during lunch-hour. “ What is to be will be.” —Michael.

When sugary things are said about the way in
which banks treat their servants, the fact is generally
overlooked that the money paid in pensions, &c., is
drawn from a fund fed by a heavy, continuous deduction
from every salary. Up to £125 the deduction usually
amounts to 5 per cent, and increases with the rate of pay.
Also it is not generally known that when a bank official
“goes cronk,” a special heavy levy is usually imposed to
wholly or partially make up the shortage. It is a recog-
nised part of a bank-slave’s functions to lessen losses,
apropos of which it has already been announced in more
than one big institution that in July there will be another
10 per cent, deduction all round, except in the case of
married men, the consequence of which is that the single
ones are getting their best girls to name the day.

The Bank of Adelaide, the one lonesome sur-
vivor of the S.A. banks, has held its annual meet-
ing under reasonably satisfactory conditions. The
amount of available profit was £33,240, and of this £3OOO
was added to reserve ; £14,000 went to pay a humble div.
at 7 per cent, per annum; and £15,240 was carried
forward. The Bank of Adelaide was born of poor but
honest parents, away back in ’65. It has a little capital
of £400,000, and a peaceful little reserve-fund of £143,000.
All its life it has been a moral little bank with an un-
blemished character, and now, when its three competitors
are dead and gone, it still pays 7 per cent, as
of old. The Town and Country, which was never much
more than a shadow, amalgamated, after a brief but
stormy existence, with the Commercial of Australia
under circumstances of a depressing character. The
Bank of S.A. amalgamated with the Union, and its
assets panned out so badly that the shortage is_ now
£340,000, and a call is threatened. The Commercial of
S.A. burst openly, and one Crookes was gaoled for several
years. Altogether, S.A. isn’t a lucky place for banks.

The periodical agitation is on again in Sydney
concerning exorbitant fire-insurance rates, and sundry
aggrieved business men —who mostly know nothing about
fire insurance—propose starting a new co. to do business
at moderate charges. The Bulletin feels sorry for that
proposed new co. Fire insurance, even at present rates,
is one of the shakiest businesses under the sun. Some
co.’s grow rich on it; others just pay their way ; others,
working on the same rates and under the same conditions,
go hopelessly bung. It requires a prophet to run a
fire office successfully; it isn’t a question of studying
risks, for bad risks at high rates pay about as well as
good ones at low rates ; but of reading the character of
the man who owns the risk. Almost every office gets
into trouble over this sooner or later. The brainy
manager dies or leaves, and he is succeeded by a mechani-
cally perfect individual who runs things to utter wreck.
He judges solely by the property, and not by the owner
of it, and issues policies for large amounts to men whose
eyes are too close together, and men with damp hands
and flat feet, and men who run Sunday-schools, and men
whose names • nd too often with “stein” or “berg.”
Then ten years’ savings flicker out peacefully in 40
minutes, and no one can tell why.
The writer of this has seen a perfectly well-
managed co. with a large capital and a large business
struggle along at a loss for 14 years and then burst up ;
also, he has seen another concern lose all its reserve-fund
and half its capital in two years, merely through insuring
men with too little nose between their eyes, and persons
who turned the palms of their hands backwards when
walking. Unless this kind of risk can be eliminated, Are
rates can’t come any lower without disaster. In fact, it
is an open question if they won’t require to be raised at
an early date.

The latest report of the Mercantile Bank is just
about £600,000 worse than the previous ones, and the
general impression is that creditors cannot possibly hope
for more than lls. or Its. 6d. in the £, Now that the
remains of (he dead institution have been put In order
the principal losses appear as follows: Advances (amount
not stated) on 700,000 worthless shares In various com-
Eanies; advances of £640,000 to bad companies on
ad security, of which amount perhaps £140,000 is
recoverable; advances of £150,000 on the personal
guarantees of busted speculators, of which sum perhaps
£15,000 is recoverable; and advances on 35,000 of the
bank’s own shares, which means the loss, not only of the
advances, but of £105,000 in calls. Also, there are
£27,000 of loans, mostly hopeless, to persons connected
with the bank. These transactions look more and more
humorous|the further they are examined. The £640,000
above mentioned were mostly lent on the worst possible
security to the Matthew Davies land companies. The
huge advances made on shares were mostly on the shares
of the same companies; and the ghastly advances
on personal guarantees were mostly made to the holders
of the same shares in the same blessed companies.
Therefore, the Davies companies were mortgaged to the-
Davies bank three deep: first, by loans to the companies;
second, by loans to the people who formed the com
panics; and, third, by loans on the paper which repre
sented these people’s interest in the companies. To th«
outside observer, the difference between Mercantil*
finance and an ordinary attack of the horrors seems too
small to be worth mentioning.

The Equitable Permanent Benefit Building
Society of Sydney issues a cheerful balance-sheet. This
institution pays 9 per cent, interest to its shareholders,
together with a bonus of something like 7 per cent.
Further, it pays a bonus to borrowing accounts, adds
£3OOO to contingency account and £2OOO to reserve
(making it £21,000), and carries £3400 forward. This
utterly astonishing result has been achieved, the directors
claim, by sticking to building society business only, and
keeping rigidly clear of land speculation, and abjuring
that “desirable suburban estate” which leadetn unto
destruction.

Judge Holroyd acted most indiscreetly in the
Priestley judgment by referring, in the terms he did, to
the qualifications of the suggested co-liquidator. It is no
part of the business of a Supreme Court Judge to
gratuitously advertise even an official assignee. And
folks are apt to think that the very fact that this gentle-
man has the “ largest experience in the realisation of in-
solvent estates ” in Victoria is a most excellent reason for
not appointing him, or any such, a liquidator. How
many farthings in the pound does “ successful realisa-
tion ” mean in Victorian experience ?
* * * ♦
Advts. offering assistance in insolvency pro-
ceedings by non-legal persons are common in Melb.
papers, and in these days of “ light ” business are alarm-
ing the privileged vamps. It is managed often thus.
A broken-down solicitor does all the professional signing
necessary at, say, a long-beer per scrawl; no receipts pass,
so that no illegal partnership can be proved; the dead-
beat drops out, and the poacher proceeds to fleece un-
molested. The beauty of the thing in Victoria lies in this,
that the only remedy the “ regular ” vamp has is under
an obsolete and ineffective N.S.W. act and he dare not ask
any other remedy from Parliament from the very reason-
able fear that even this scarecrow of the unlicensed
practitioner will be taken from him. So land-agents,
banks, auctioneers, accountants, &c., &c., prepare deeds
and documents “at law and in equity,” to the scandal and
pecuniary loss of “ an honourable profession.”

Queensland Government Geologist Jack thus
writes about the Palmer in his book on the Geology of
Queensland, pp. 540; “ My own conviction is that in the
Palmer district there are deep leads containing an amount
nf void which will dwarf into insignificance the four or
five million pounds’ worth already obtained from the
field.” As Mr. Jack opines that these leads are sand-
wiched between the paleozoic rocks and the desert sand-
stone. the “ deep” leads of the Palmer may be fossicked
for and found perhaps a thousand feet above the level of
the present Palmer valley. „
Rev. J. Curran says that in every 20 miles of
beach from Port Stephens to the Richmond River (N.S.W.)
there are £20,000,000 worth of gold. Yea, and how much
void is there in every 20 cubic miles of sea-water ?

Dear Bulletin,—A few lines to tell you of
anomalies re the granting of “ permits ” to mine on
Neeid’s selections, Wyalong field. Sometime in March,
Warden Slee repeatedly told prospectors thaX in no
instance would he grant more than one “permit to one
aoulicant. This was regarded as an excellent plan to
encourage bona-fide prospecting and prevent mining-
sharks from monopolising the land. Knowing that several
persons had applied for more than one permit and
feeling confident that the warden would grant no more
than one, some parties of prospectors re-pegged and re-
applied for those blocks that were not being worked.
j,,d„ e their surprise when, on 6th April, they saw posted
the ''folio wing official notice, “All persons having their
names on more than one application for permit must have
their names erased and others substitutedf &c., &c.
Which of course, was simply telling the grabsters to make
bo ms transfers to their relatives and friends. A more
glaring injustice could scarcely be conceived. Warden
Slee also told us that “permits” would not be transfer-
able but only the other day the off-chance of procuring a
“permit ” was sold for the sum of £42 IBs., and vendor,
it is stated, was promised that the permit would be with-
held until the money was paid over. The supervision
of this field by the Mines Department has been one dis-
graceful bungle from beginning to end. In the first
place Neeid’s selections should not have been granted,
as gold was found on the property and officially reported
at least two months before the selection was approved of.
A mining registrar—not connected with the police depart-
ment—should have been sent to this field in order to
satisfactorily cope with the great press of business conse-
quent on a new and important rush. A site for a town-
ship should have been earlier surveyed, and would thus
have prevented an East and West Wyalong two miles
apart—obviously a great inconvenience to many.— Fred
Bradshaw, Wyalong, May 5, 1894.
♦ ♦ * *
At Wyalong, 332 tons of stone have been crushed
f*r 4620 z. This represents 16 claims, and it is very
funnily pointed out by the daily papers that the yield is
“better than that of Charters Towers.” Yes, if there is
enough of it. The Bulletin sincerely hopes there is, but
is very doubtful. Prospects are certainly improving now
that earnest work has begun. Of 102 claims it is said that
70 are on payable stone, with about 1000 tons at grass. A
new reef has been pegged out close to the main street,
and all the buildings are included in the application areas.

Gloomy accounts of Ooolgardie come from the
Easterners who have been lucky enough, as they phrase
it to get back again. Two Sydney men—an accountant
and a mechanical engineer—after seeing all the shows,
are convinced there is “nothing in it. When we left
Kurnalpi, there must have been 2000 miners on the field,
and. as an illustration of the country, we couldn t buy a
bit of gold for a breastpin. We spent about two months
in seeking for gold, and found one solitary speck. Exclu-
give of the trip from Sydney to Perth and back again we
spent £6O between us on food and travelling which, in
most cases, meant simply carriage for our swags. During
one journey of 110 miles we paid IBs. 6d. for drinking-
water. For six weeks we lived on damper and treacle,
varied by an occasional mouthful of cheese. all
who think of going to West Australia, our advice is—
•don’t.’”
On the other hand, Mr. Begelhole, late manager
of Bayley’s Reward, thinks prospects of permanency good,
though he admits that there is little doing at present.
The unemployed are beginning to congregate at Perth,
and the cry is “Down with the Forrest Ministry!
The water at the 240 ft. level of Bayley’s is making 17,000
gals, a day, and every drop is precious.
It’s lust this way, so far as the present writer
san see. The known Westralian alluvial is worked out.
What there was of it, as described by various working-
miners in The Bulletin, was heavy and patchy. Anyone
who. without plenty of money, goes to hunt alluvial in
anprospected districts is a madman. But if there
are not in Westralia countless reefs which will in the
near future employ, perhaps, millions of capital, and
jertainly thousands of miners, The Bulletin has struck
the finest collection of liars and false prophets of modern
times. . .
The water-difficultv will, it is safe to predict,
not long endure at Ooolgardie. When Bayley s opens
out further, it will get thousands of gallons per hour
Instead of thousands of gallons per day, and will then
loon accumulate enough to supply 20 head of stamps.
And so it will be with other mines. The Murchison is in
one respect far behind Ooolgardie—for it has no wood
whatever. It may rain water any time at Ooolgardie, but
it will never rain sticks at Cue.
It is not generally known that manager Begel-
hole got enough gold out of the first four dishes of speci-
mens, picked by him from Bayley’s reef, to enable
Sylvester Browne to pay the whole price of the mine,
£6OOO. ‘ ,

Mr. Begelhole, late manager of Bayley’s
Reward, when asked in Sydney, the other day, what was
really the value of Bayley’s stone-heap, replied: wen,
when I left it was about 3000 tons, and 1 would make one
of a syndicate to take it at soz. per ton. Mr. Begelhole
Will settle at Ooolgardie as a mining expert, and has
already been offered the oversight .of some apparently
important properties.

there lust when hundreds are leaving in disgust. Look
at the man, and compare the feat of that solitary, obscure

miles a day with a team of camels loaded with air-cushions,

The richest patch of auriferous sand yet dis-

alleged, three miles north of Woody Head, near Clarence
Heads. The band is 4ft. thick and shows gold plainly all
through, stripping about 20ft.
The gold from Bayley’s Reward exhibited by
the London jewellers, Spink and Co. in Gracechurch-
street, attracted such crowds of people that two police-
men were constantly employed in urging the eager gazers
to “ pass on.” Many a poor devil, dragging his blistered
feet over the parched sands of Westraha, will look back to

The N.S.W. Full Court has refused the
application for a new trial in the case of Norton v.
Crick. In its own small way, this case is a fine
specimen of the law’s delays. Since the jury s
verdict was delivered there have been about a
dozen separate sets of proceedings in regard to it
—motions for new trial, motions for the attach-
ment of the defendant, motions for injunctions to
prevent the defendant being attached, motions that
the in j unction should be made absolute, applications
regarding costs, applications to prevent the plaintiff
proceeding further with his application regarding
costs applications that the defendant should find
security for the amount of the verdict, appearances
to draw the court’s attention to the fact that the
security hadn’t been found, and so on. Only an
expert lawyer knows how many different kinds of
delays there are in the law; if the costs are forth-
coming, and either party is determined to go the
whole hog and go it to the bitter end, it takes two
years and .£lO,OOO of expenses to collect a AlOO
verdict in Australia.
The relative positions of Mr. Adams, the
direct Labour-candidate, and Mr. J. N. Lirks,
Single-taxer and nominee of the Democratic Oluo,
in the election for the Adelaide district of the
S A Legislative Council, shows how foolish the
United Labour-men were in joining their forces
with the Georgites. Had they been content to
run Mr. Adams by himself and to give their sup-
port to a second Liberal candidate both would
have been returned, for the National Ass selection,
Alderman Fuller, who crept into the second place,
could not have stood up against a Progressive
Land-taxer who was not a faddist. Adams,
in 1893, came within one vote of beating Works-
Minister Jenkins at the Sturt, and though mur-
derous in respect to aspirates is a man of broad
views and his success represents a distinct gain to
the liberals, for both Simpson and Angus were
capitalistic conservatives. Fuller has been Mayor
of Adelaide more than once and has previously
sat in the Assembly. He is managing-director of
the big coaching firm of John Hill and Co., and a
favoured child of the National Ass, which spent
much money and influence in securing his return.

Wilcox, ex-Treasurer Rounsevell, Pensioner-

Messrs. J. & C. Howard.
The accompanying engraving gives some idea of
the characteristic contents of the Sydney ware-
house of Messrs. J. and C. Howard, at 280 and
Pitt-street. The firm is now well-known in
Australia as a manufacturer and importer of all
kinds of tools and machinery, including not only
the specialties in ploughs and other farming im-
plements which first made its founder famous, but
also such diverse products of mechanical ingenuity
as wool-presses, pumps, engines, and boilers,
dairy and irrigation plant, mining and excavation
requisites, blacksmiths’, engineers’, and wheel-
wrights’ stock—in fact, any compound of steel,
wood, and iron used in the great developmental
industries of the country. As agents for Messrs.
Clayton and Shuttleworth’s tools and machinery,
Messrs. J. and C. Howard have a special advan-
tage in supplying the Australian trade.
The firm’s immense business has grown up
entirely within the last 50 years, and its founder
died so recently as 1889. James Howard, born in
Bedford (Eng.) in 1821, was one of the best and
most enterprising citizens who ever sprung from
that historical city. The son of an ironmonger in
a small way of trade, he raised himself by native
energy and ability to be Mayor of Bedford, its
representative in the British Parliament, and
High Sheriff and Deputy-Lieutenant of the county.
The Britannia Iron Works are one of the chief
sights of Bedford, and employ upwards of 1000
workmen. Here is manufactured most of the
improved machinery which, thanks to inventive
talent and practical knowledge, has become popular
all over the world, and everywhere justifies the
thousands of encomiums that have been lavished
iupon it.
Like everything great, the Britannia Iron
Works started in a very small way. James
Howard, while a lad in his father’s workshop, took
particular interest in the farming operations going
on close by, and his busy mind soon evolved im-
portant improvements on the old-fashioned
ploughs then in use. He constructed a new plough
to his own ideas, tested it in a ploughing contest
in Liverpool, and won the first prize. This was
the first time an iron plough of the present type
was ever exhibited in public; and, though
numerous small altera-
tions have been made,
the model of the original
Howard plough still re-
mains the standard. A
demand arose for the new
plough, which James
Howard and his brother
panted in vain to keep
pace with. Twice they
shifted to larger works,
and then the Britannia
Iron Works were born,
capable of expansion to
any extent, and con-
venient for both rail and
water.
The parish of Clapham
and the south-western
portion of Bedford con-
tain the most striking
monuments of the great
practical and sterling
dualities of Jas. Howard.
In Clapham there are
model cottages and a
village club; also a
model estate of 500 acres,
and mansion—the out-
come of a restless and
ever - progressive mind.
Mr. Howard and his
brother Frederick pur-
chased the Clapham Park
Estate from the Earl of
Ashburnham i n 1862,
and have since farmed
it in a most scientific
manner. Thousands of
English and foreign agri-
culturists have resorted
to Clapham Park to in-
spect the farming and
live-stock, and tens of
thousands to the great
agricultural machine fac-
tory on the banks of
the Ouse. Mr. Howard
was probably as success-
ful in the breeding of
large white Yorkshire
pigs, shire horses, and
shorthorns, as his
1 rother had been with
Oxford Down rams, and
by the aid of the most
improved and modern
appliances he has per-
iormed experiments and
nnade observations winch have conferred alasting
benefit upon agriculture.
Mr. Howard was an active member of the
Council of tlie Royal Agricultural Society of
England He was the first President of the
rmgiano. xxe was trie nrsc i. resident of the
1 armers Alliance, and at different times was
President of the London I armers’ Club, to which
he contributed many papers, and of the Agricul-
tural Engineers’ Association; for many years he
was a director of the Agricultural Hall, in the
erection of which building he was mainly instru-
mental also a Fellow of tlm Sanitary Institute of
(iTßiifc And or ths otcitistiCcil bociGty, In
1888, he published “An estimate of the annual
amount realised by the sale of the Farm Products
of the United Kingdom, including Market
Gardens, Orchards and Fruit Grounds, calculated
upon the average of the seasons 1885, 1886, 1887.”
1 his formidable work was very favourably re-
viewed, and will form the basis for future calcula-
tions of a similar character. In 1878, he became
Chevalier of the Legion of Honour, the cross of
II, « order being conferred upon Mr., Howard by
the French Government in recognition of bis
services as one of Her Majesty s Commissioners of
the Paris Exhibition, and especially for his valu-
able aid in the advancement of agriculture
generally
It is to the catholic intelligence of Mr. James
Howard, and especially to his practical knowledge
of agriculture, that tlie perfection of the Britannia
implements is chiefly due. They are exactly
adapted to tlie character of the work to be under-
taken and invariably give the maximum of power

The envelopes now in use with the gum
not right across the flap can be very easily opened
with a pen-holder or pencil, the end of either of
which is placed in one corner of the envelope and
gently rolled. The gum gives way without tear-
ing the paper and the flap flies up. There is no
trouble in closing the opened envelope ; it is done
by simply applying additional gum to the flap.
To prevent this, gum should be taken right across
to the corners.
Attorney-General Byrnes did not see his
way to move in the case of the child-assault at
Toowoomba, referred to in The Bulletin of
March 22, of which the adjudicating P.M. said
‘‘there could be no moral doubt as to the commis-
sion _of the offence.” The reasons given why
nothing can be done were that the child was too
young to give evidence (three years), and the
absence of medical evidence. These reasons, how-
ever, did not prevent the aboriginal Jacky from
being sentenced at Rockhampton District Court
on April 10 to 14 mouths’ imprisonment and 18
lashes for a similar assault on a child of 4J years,
though the evidence was, if anything, weaker
than in the Toowoomba ease. Bat oaoky, the
aboriginal, is certainly not “a respectable person.”

travelled 219 miles in a little over 20 hours, which,
I think, is a better record than that of “ Drome-

bred in this country, is a better animal all round

giving him away. He
was duly hanged for it,
but in his last moments
he told the whole stoiy
of the running-down, and
his statements were cor-
roborated by other evi-
dence. The court de-
cided, however, that a
man sentenced to death
was legally a dead man,
and the testimony of a
corpse wasn’t admissible,
and even the fact that
the law afterwards
hanged that same dead
corpse by the neck until
it was defunct couldn’t
shake the court’s convic-
tion that it was already
deceased. Consequently
the owner won his case.

Messrs. Goldsborough, Mort and Co,, Ltd,,
have issued their Annual Review of the past
wool-season. It is a neatly-prepared pamphlet,
carefully compiled, ably written, and containing
matter brimful of interest to squatters and sheep-
fai rners. From a tabulated statement it appears
that during the season just closed there were
offered 455,025 bales and 398,030 sold. Of this
number the co. disposed of 52,041 bales. These
figures indicate the growing popularity of the
local market in preference to the foreign auction
mart, and in this respect wool-growers give evi-
dence of their good sense and judgment.
Patrick M‘Manus, lately arrested at Gun-
nedah in re the Barraba murder, and afterwards
discharged with an apology from the Bench, writes
to The Bulletin a letter the warmth whereof, at
least partially pardonable under the circumstances,
precludes it being published in full. He avers that
the constable s statement on oath that he (M‘M.)
when arrested said “he anticipated as much ”
is as false as truth is true.” The policeman
swore : Searched M‘Manus’ house and found
therein slouched hat.” “Until the day of my
arrest,’ continues M‘Manus, “said ‘slouched
hat was a felt hat sewn up on both sides—boat-
shaped or nearer cocked-hat.” The Bulletin
cannot follow its correspondent further, but
advises him on public grounds to have bis case
tiilly and publicly represented to Parliament by
the member for his district. The Question of
veracity between him and the arresting constable
will probably never be cleared up to the absolute
satisfaction of any but those whose personal know-
ledge enables them to fully judge of the character
Ox both.

THE TEST OF TIME.
A MOST MARVELLOUS SPECIFIC.
WHAT A WELL-KNOWN AUSTRALIAN
SAYS.
St. Jacobs Oil, the greatest pain-conqueror in
the world, is one of the few remedies which have
been found to stand the test of time. This is well
exemplified by the testimonials which are con-
stantly being received on the subject from grateful
Australians. For instance, Mr. John Jamieson
Porter, who was very favourably known through-
out the colonies as the agent for Messrs. Chaney
Brothers, the irrigationists of Mildura and Ren-
mark, and is at present one of the most popular
mining agents in Australia, has just written to
us as follows the testimonial I sent you
about ten vears ago, stating that a persistent
use of St. Jacobs Oil in a very short time had
cured me of a severe attack of rheumatism in my
knee, from which I had suffered great pain for
several years, and also rheumatism in the shoulder
and hand; I have never had the slightest recur-
rence of a single twinge, although I have travelled
many thousands of miles in the colonies, and been
exposed to all temperatures and weathers, wet
and dry, by sea and land, camping out and
roughing it. I never travel without a bottle of
St. Jacobs Oil, which I have found useful not
only to myself, but also to others in eases of
sprains, strains of the muscles, &c.

HERR RASSMUSSEN, PH.D.
A Few Sketches of His Interesting Life and
A Work.
Herb Rassmussen, who is known throughout
the world as “The Celebrated Danish Her-
balist,” was born in the little kingdom of Den-
mark, shortly after its last disastrous war with
Germany. His parents being wealthy, and
belonging to the most influential class, he
received a first-class education, and displayed
exceptional talent in the science of botany and
botanical chemistry, and very soon surpassed
everyone of his fellow scholars in those sub-
jects, and eventually made the science of botany
his life-study
Finding his native country too small, and its
flora too limited to extend his botanical re-
searches, he left for Australia, and landed here
in the beginning of 1879. His first object was
to learn the English language and become
familiar with the customs and habits of his
adopted country, as well as with its botanical
history and medicinal flora. Herr Rassmussen
had quite his share of the troubles and dimcui-
ties which usually befall a newcomer in Aus-
tralia ; but he soon overcame every difficulty,
and after five years’travelling through all the
colonies, investigating every known Australian
medicinal plant, and discovering many new
ones, he eventually settled down permanently
in Sydney in 1883, and then commenced a
most noble mission—that of turning his most
wonderful botanical discoveries to the benefit
and relief of suffering humanity. Herr Rass-
mussen succeeded in this gigantic undertaking
far beyond all expectations, and his name very
soon became a household word, not only in
every Australian camp, village and city, but
also throughout Europe, Africa and America.
Space will not permit to mention the
numerous cures effected by his now world-
famed Ale aline Remedies, suffice it to say
that thousands of original testimonials may be
inspected by anyone at his Head Depot, 047
George Street, Sydney, many of which may
also be seen in' his celebrated work, Ihe
Natural Doctor.” r?
There is no doubt whatever that Herr Rass-
mussen deserves all the success and praise which
he has met with, because he is a most scientific,
conscientious and genuine herbalist—his last
ten years record being so wonderful that jus
remedies must have cured more human suffering
in that period than is usually effected by a
hundred average doctors in a similar number of
vears He does not hold any consultation
similar to a doctor; his whole business is
purely a Proprietary Herbal Remedy Business.
He simply prepares a genuine herbal remedy
specially for the nerves, and another for the blood,
and so on, which can always be relied upon.
He prints on the box containing the remedy its
price and all advice as to doses and diet and
other particulars, and advertises same, which
is the fairest way possible to conduct a business
of this kind. Any information or particulars
desired are given or sent absolutely free of
charge. Pamphlets are sent post free to any
person desiring one, containing all particulars
and many useful and valuable hints on health.
Herr Rassmussen has very large branches
of his extensive business in Melbourne,
Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Wellington (N.Z.),
and throughout the world. He is an
honorary member of several scientific socie-
ties, a gold medalist, diplomee and Hon.
Core. Mem. of the Academic Pansienne des
Inventeurs, France ; last year he received the
Honorary University degree of Doctorof
Philosophy ; in 1887, he was presented with a
magnificent gold medal by several of his cured
patrons in Sydney, and also awarded a silver
medal in Denmark, 1888, a bronze nieda ,
Melbourne, 1893; and in 1891 he issued his
“ Natural Doctor,” a herbal medical work of a
high standard for which he received great
praise from the press, and which is now trans-
lated into many languages.

Tasmanian Premier Braddon suggests that
capitalists who propose to settle in Tasmania
should be exempted from taxation for the first two
years of residence. Braddon’s capitalists are tle

old stomachs with fiery dishes of unsavoury
appearance, and keep themselves unspotted from
the horny-handed herd who peer through the
hedges which divide their sacred residences from
the highway.
Mrs. Lynn Linton, the fierce old lady who
writes novels, in her latest book declares herself a
vigorous opponent of female suffrage, and dedicates
the volume “to the sweet girls among us who
have no part in the new revolt and are content to
be beautiful and innocent and sheltered. ihis
sets one thinking of Mrs. Linton’s best heroine,
the wild-haired Italian girl who braine her husband
with a decanter and, after she has done her term
in gaol, is abducted by an old lover who turns her
into a dreary household drudge in his hut beside
Mount Etna.
A weird instance of the depressing foolish-
ness of the law comes from England. Somewhere
about 1873 there was submitted for probate a will,
certain bequests in which had been obliterated by
the simple process of gumming bits of paper over
various sentences. The persons interested fought
the case bitterly in the law-courts, and demanded
that the gummed paper should be taken oft by
steam, and that the complete will should be
admitted in the usual way. But the Court decided
that the gummed paper couldn’t be lawfully
removed, and that though the writing underneath
could be distinctly read when the document was
held up against a window-pane, still it wasn t
legible “ within the meaning of the Act because
the Act made no provision for holding any legal
document up against a window-pane, bo probate
was granted upon so much of the will as could be
read and thereafter the matter slumbered for 20
years. All that time, however, science kept
moving on, and lately, by a new process of light-
concentration, it has become possible to read the
obliterated parts of the old will without holding it
up against a window. Thereupon the conflict was
started afresh, and at last the law has solemnly
decided that the passages in question are now
apparent within the meaning of the Act, and
probate has been granted accordingly, it is a
strange world.
Dear Bulletin,—A recent Bulletin par.
alleges that Pat Buckley, K.C.M.G., joined issue
with and defeated Maonland Justice Johnston
on the latter’s habit of lecturing acquitted
prisoners. Buckley never had sand enough in
him to face Johnston and live thereafter; his
stock-in-trade is not grit, but oil, grease, soap;
all knights of to-day use it. John Holmes ex-
Yietorian District Court Judge-many years lead-
ing-criminal pleader here—was the man who did
tackle Johnston in ding-dong fight. I was present
at the scene—which was the trial of a man for
perjury. Solely by Holmes’ thunder-and-lightning
defence he was acquitted. The alleged perjury
consisted of defendant swearing he had sold a
horse to a man on Christchurch racecourse on a
Cun-day ; the latter proved he was at iimaru, lUU
miles away, on that day. The jury acquitted
and Johnston refused to discharge prisoner until
the Court rose and made several vitriolic remarks
on the case. Holmes (then M.P. for Christchurch)
was instantly on his feet and threatened to
impeach the Judge before Parliament. His
Honor flared and fumed, and a battle-royal
ensued, but the counsel put him down. Holmes,
now retired into private life, is a real live
Democrat, and fought right valiantly by the side
of Stout (then plain “Robert ), Ballance, and
others, long before even a glimmer of the present
great success of Liberalism appeared in the
political sky. It will be a cold day when Pat
Buckley, knight, is found howling for the losing
dog. —Horsehair.
Dear Bulletin, —Some old-time experi-
ences of U.S. prohibition. One dark night m 72,
I found myself at a train dep6t on the Little Blue
River in Nebraska, awaiting, after a long journey,
a cousin who lived in that region. He had pro-
mised to meet me, but didn t turn up. So 1 found
myself stranded. However, a gentleman at the
dep6t, with a waggonette and pair, offered to
drive me across the prairie to within a mile or two
of my destination. I enquired if we could get a
nip before starting. “ No,” said he. This iai a
teetotal country, and there are no pubs here
You can only get a drink at the doctor s shop, and
you have to be known to get it then. Well,
never mind,” I replied, “ I’ve got a flask of whisky
in my pocket, and we can make shift with that
I had bought a pint at Omaha and had haidly
touched it. So we each had a pull and then set
off After an hour’s smart driving across the
prairie we reached MTadden, a one-horse town-
ship on the Little Blue River, consisting of a store
and post-office, a doctor’s shop, and a boarding-
house kept by one Woodroffe who had married
the widow of the original MTadden, and who
provided me with board. A young English
boarder named George and I soon became
chums and polished off _ the remains of my
whisky before we turned in. Next morning, 1
said to George ; “ Is there nowhere we can go and

“ Doctor, my friend is not very well this mornm o

“ He doesn’t look very well, and you don t look

in a bottle of the stuff and said to the doctor,
“ You don’t look very well yourself, doctor, won t
vou ioin us?” He replied, I don t mind if I

another on top of it. As we were going away, the
doctor hiccupped in my ear, in a stage whisper,

Dear Bulletin, —The obituary notice ot
the late William Stanbridge recalls an incident
of many years ago. He had a nice place near
Uaylesford, with the best fruit-garden, probably,
within 20 miles. One afternoon I threshed the
few hundred bushels of oats he had grown for his
own horses; and next morning, after breakfast,
the machine was standing packed for shifting, but
there was some delay with the teams. Stanbridge
had come out to the stack-yard, and I was
explaining to him the construction of the machine:
“This is where the grain is delivered, Mr Stan-
bridge”—I raised the little portcullis, and out
rolled about a bushel of excellent fruit. We were
both too polite to pass any remark. “ And this,
he inquired, “is this the drum ? ” “ Oh, no, that s
the rotary screen ; I’ll just show you ” —I opened
the end door as I spoke, and inadvertently showed
him a sort of cylindrical wire crate packed with
fruit. “If you’ll look in here, Mr. Stanbridge,
said I, decoying him to the back of the machine,
“you’ll see the whole system of riddles in their
places ” —and we both looked in—to note a further
supply of the perishable commodity. “And
here’s where we raise the wind,’’ I continued, with
sickly jocularity—“ this is the main^ blast. He
looked in and saw the fan-blades buried in another
bushel of the infernal product. I had to stop. It
was like fooling with a dynamite bomb. Just
then the old gentleman’s eye was attracted by the
cores of apples and pears and the stones of various
other fruits, strewn profusely over the cleanly-
swept yard. He glanced at the dozen or so of
fellows standing here and there, but all with their
backs toward him, and each man s shirt bulged
with a supply for immediate consumption. A look
of deep vexation grew on his face. “ Come here,
raen _ a ]l of you. I’ve got something to say to
you. I’m very sorry to see this on my place.
I feel very much annoyed to think of you spending
your trifle of money in fruit, while I’ve abundance
of it in the garden. I should have thought about
this before. But you can cut across the paddocks
to your next place. Certainly ! Now, men ;
go to the gardener, tell him I sent you, and just
help yourselves to any fruit you like. Don t be
afraid of taking a supply for to-morrow. Hurry
along, now, hurry along.” Which they frankly
did.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The Q.T.C. has now definitely refused to
acknowledge the status of the Central Queensland Racing
Association, which means disqualification on the Q.T.C.
register of horses running at C.Q.H.A. meetings. The
Q.T.C. (whose title is now a misnomer) felt the secession
of both the N.Q.R.A. and the C.Q.R.A. keenly, but last
year it apparently decided to make the best of a bad job,
and wish the latter good luck. This year, however, the
true Southern dislike to shifting the monopoly of influence
and profits from Brisbane is apparent, and the C.Q.R.A.
has been staggered by the announcement that the older
association will not recognise it. This is done, of
course, in the “ beat interests of horse-racing”—not from
jealousy.

Why is it that Australia produces no famous

Melbourne Hunt Club races at Flemington on

Inside of a twelve-month there will be no pony-

dwindled into a mere tactical struggle between various

pony-race nowadays is almost as certain to be robbed as
if he engaged in a game at “ two up ” with a speiler well
accoutred with “greys.”

Trotting is to get still another show, both at
Liverpool and Lilliebridge (Sydney), and it remains to be
seen if the trotting men will turn over a new leaf.
Owners of trotters have only themselves to blame that a
trot with a big stake is not an event at all the proprietary
meetings about Sydney. Canterbury tried it, but threw
the sponge up in disgust; then Kensington had a sickener,
and the swindles palled even on Lilliebridge. The trot-
ting-horse deserves a better fate than to fall into the
hands of the majority of men who follow the game, and
it is to be hoped that owners, if only in the interests of
their own pockets, will give the sport the show it deserves.

The Interprovincial Eight-oar contest on the

ning easily, with N.S.W. second and Queensland a bad
last. The Vies, jumped away at the start, N.S.W. follow-
ing, and the positions were maintained to the finish,
which was reached in 16.41 J. The winners had the ad-
vantage of carrying a coxswain of only fist. 41b. weight, or
a couple of stone lighter than their adversries’, but that
had little effect upon the result. Donald, the stroke,
quite satisfied all the critics whocried out against him being
chosen for the stern seat, and he holds the distinction of
being the first Ballarat oarsmen who has stroked a Vic.
crew. H. Waters, the North Shore Hercules, who rowed
six in the N.S.W. boat, does not create the impression
down south that he does on the Harbour, though Moore
is thought a great lot of. As far as the Bananalanders are
concerned, one Yarraite threatened to produce a maiden
eight who would “ donkey-lick ” them. Victoria has
won thirteen, N.S.W., four, and Queensland one of these

M'Burney, Wallis & Co.’s Report.
M’Butney Wallis and Co. write:—No auction has been
held since our last week’s report, and as wool is only
arriving in very small quantities there is practically no
change in quotations, although some small lines of scoured
have been placed at a shade above offers at auction.
London cables re sales now proceeding there continue to
be received, and the general tenor of them is to the effect
that prices are about equal to the level established at
opening sales, except for faulty and inferior greasy, which
are showing a decided fall.
Judging from a recent cable advising that the United
States Senate had agreed to removal of the duties on wool
imported into that country on artf afVr 2nd Aug. next,
it seems as if this much-vexed question is approaching a
settlement. We sincerely hope it is, as without
doubt it will have a beneficial effect on the price
of Australian wool. The present duty on greasy wool
there is 11 cents per lb., which at existing price
of wool would run at equal to 80 per cent, ad
valorem, so that after this we hardly expect to see it
swept away altogether, and the general opinion of the
trade puts it down at 10 per cent, ad valorem. At all
events American buyers expect something as they are
reported as operating with greater freedom at present
London sales.
Next Sydney auctions will be held on 16th and 17th
instant, and now that London basis of values seems to be
fairly established we expect buyers to show somewhat
more desire to do business than at last sales.
We are pleased to be able to chronicle the above, which
is the most favourable news we have had for some time,
and are of opinion that with the arrival of the coming
clip some definite rise may be looked for.

Messrs. Charlemonb and Co., the well-
known Sydney photographers, have produced an
excellent picture of the New South Wales’ eight
who rowed in the intercolonial race on the Yarra

The magnificient billiard-room at Aarons’
Exchange Hotel, which Roberts and Cook selected

built for Roberts’ first match, at a cost of .£240,
still remains in its place, but a new Alcock of the
same class has been added as an extra attraction.

Mrs. Yates, the Maoriland Mayor, has just created
a commotion by thrusting out with her own hands
male trash who came to guy her at the council-
board, and a ladies’ deputation in Melbourne has
plainly told Vic. Minister for Lands MTntyre
that he had been drunk recently. Then :
“Who told you that?” demanded the Minister in an
angry tone. “Oh, we heard it,” said a chorus of female
voices. “Where did you hear it?” asked Mr. M’lntyre.
One of the ladies stated that her son had so informed her,
and he never told a lie. “No,” retorted Air. Arintyre,
“he would not be a son of yours if he did.” “What,”
said the lady in indignant tones, “did you say? He was
not my son ?” The Minister did not pursue the subject
further. “You know,” said one of the deputation in a
coaxing manner, “ it’s not so very dreadful to get tipsy,”
but Mr. M’lntyre declared he had tasted nothing stronger
than water that day, and objected to such “villainous”
statements being made about him. Finally the Minister
declined to accede to the request of the deputation. The
ladies therefore left the room full of indignation. One of
them, fixing her eye on Air. M’lntyre, said, “ Thank good-
ness, there will soon be another Minister of Lands."

Messrs. Heyde, Todman, and Co. are
introducing to Sydney smokers the celebrated
Spencer cigars, made at Dindigul in Southern
India, and smoked by every Indian potentate
from the Governor-General down to the trumpery
Rajah with a territory of an acre and a-half and
17 blighted subjects to pay him tribute. Spencer’s
cigars are the dream of infancy, the joy of man-
hood, and the support and consolation of old age.
Their smoke curls round the soul like the embrace
of a wet water-nymph ; they bring to tired
humanity the peace which passeth all under-
standing; they are bed and breakfast rolled
into one, and contain more solid nutriment than a
porterhouse-steak done to a turn on a silver grill
by _ a chef in a spotless cap and apron for
which he owes the washerwoman fivepence.
At the first whiff all your woes and worries
vanish like beer before a thirsty policeman,
at the second you spurn the sordid earth
and are borne to the gates of Paradise by
fat little cherubs all wings and no body, at the
third you enter in and recline on a couch of rose-
leaves, while from 15 to 34 houris (according to the
quality of cigar), assorted blondes, brunettes,
and albinoes, come to lap you in Elysium.
The whole of this entertainment is included
in the price of the cigar, and there are no
extra admission fees whatever; while the price
of the cigar is lower than any cigar of the same
virtue and aroma was ever sold for before. After
this, the man who doesn’t go and buy a box of
Spencer’s cigars (for choice, two boxes) should
renounce his clothes and his manhood and go and
live with green frogs in a black swamp as a typical
melancholy mudsnout.
The successful removal of Piles of the
most stubborn description is being effected by

The old aphorism, “Marry in haste, &c.,
might sometimes be twisted into “ Unmarry in
haste and repent at leisure,” as the following true
tale —a sort of N.S. W. set-off to that of the Maon-
Hnd maiden who said “No” at the altar sig-
nifies. It was to be a country wedding, and the
bride, in white array, looking out of her window,
beheld the parson, who had been posed below in
the flower-trimmed drawing-room waiting to unite
the culprits, riding away with his surplice in a
bag although the bridegroom was understood to
be changing his boots in the spare room and all
the arrangements were en traind
When the astonished victim swooped down to
demand a reasonable explanation—downcast dove
turned into a white hawk in a twinkling the
barmv man gamely confessed that he didn t want
to marry just yet, and would the lady name her
figure? She was just of age, and, in the heat of
the moment and pride of managing her own
affairs, squared the thing off her own racquet for
five hundred ; the released prisoner wrote a cheque
then and there, for which he got a receipt, worded
T don’t know how. “ Received from Mr. Blank,
the sum of so much, on condition that 1 dont
insist on marrying him,” seems to me to tit the
case. And then he got on his horse and galloped
away, and the bride laid her blushes up in laven-
der for the next man.
But that isn’t the end of the story. About a
month after these things happened a Sydney
lawyer was visited by the ex-bride who
wanted professional advice as to whether she
hadn’t assessed her blighted feelings below ruling
market rates, and whether there was any legal
cause or impediment against her going through
her fickle swain for a cool thousand ? But, alas .
the receipt stood in the way, and the enterprising
damsel was left lamenting the absurd bargain-sale
price she put upon herself. “ Next time, she
said candidly to the lawyer, 111 have a better
idea of what to charge. Any man who pits this
helpless maiden now does so at his own risk.
Apropos of the Maoriland bridegroom who,
after being refused at the altar, next day married
the unwilling bride and then suicided, I hear that
on© day, some time previously, the unhappy pair
started for church to be married, but never got
there. Attempting it the second time she met a
funeral, and, deeming it an ill-omen, gave her
now well-advertised refusal at the altar. N ext
day being frightened into it, she went to church
and the wedding happened. Already, as the
world knows, her worst fears have been realised.
Which incident recalls a similar one, but with a
different ending. The wedding-party had to pass
through the cemetery to the church. On the way
the “bride” stumbled over some tombstone-
fittings awaiting erection near one of the graves.
This, apparently, annoyed the ‘ bridegroom,
who snapped out, irritably : “ Damn ! What
are you up to now ?” The “ bride’ picked herself
UP and said nothing until they were before the
altar, when, the question being put, an emphatic
“No!” astonished those present. Her brother
“remonstrated,” but she crushed him with : ‘ No,
I won’t! If he could say what he did to me when
I fell just now, only five minutes before marriage,
what in Heaven’s name, would he say after he
had got me fast? No! Let him go! I wont
have him!” She left the building, and was
happy ever afterwards.”
The picture of the Maoriland knickerbooker*
wedding group, with the Ned-Trickettish-looking
bride grabbfng the small-headed bridegroom (who
is like George Goodman seen through the other
end of a telescope) by the collar-bone, and the
bifurcated wedding-guests grouped around, is
before me. I cannot say that the prospect pro-
vokes me into wanting to similarly dispense with
skirts. The odd thing is that the males (which
sometimes isn’t the same as men) in the group
wear “knickers,” too, as if the sexes had deter-
mined to “ pull devil pull baker ” no longer, but
to divide the trews into equal portions. And
what further strikes me is the saucy appearance of
the ladies, who all wear one arm akimbo and look
wickedly at the photographer.
My mind on dress-reform is this: While the
women refrain from carrying bricks up ladders,
furling the main top’s’l and riding on top to oblige
a gentlemen, there is no earthly reason for them
to scud under bare poles—their petticoats don t
hinder them when the going is flat. And any
woman who wants to step wider than the present
skirt allows has altogether missed her vocation—
—she ought to go into business as a jumping-jack.
By the way, somebody has interviewed the bride
who began her married life in the attire wherein
the “grey mares” of matrimony metaphorically
leave of—and got miles of “copy ” out of the
situation. After looking at the meek and hen-
pecked aspect of the dress-reform hubby, nobody
would discredit the statement that he is a vege-
tarian, “ who lives on a loaf of brown bread and
six apples a day . . • not only lives on it, bub
breaks 30-mile bicycle records on it ’—which is,
after all, a mere commonplace achievement along-
side that of the man who broke all ten command-
ments on one bottle of whisky. But what a lively
couple these poor reformed beings will make
anti-smoking, anti-drinking, anti-meat-eating—
anti-everything 1 And what’s the good . After
all, a diet of brown bread and little apples isn t a
safeguard against getting hit on the head with a
flower-pot.
Women, it seems, are the “ bitterest opponents”
of dress-reform according to the Maoriland pro-
phetess, but where is the man who would care to
go balancing down the Block with a knicker-
bocker enthusiast ? “ You’d be afraid to walk
down High-street with a bifurcated woman, said
the bride to the reporter. Which was a solid fact,
although the scribe said he would only be too
pleased; for jealous man little^ likes to show off to
the world the legs of his particular feminine. If
knickerbockers are to be the rule, they will have
to be enforced by Act of Parliament and all
womankind will have to appear on the street on
one and the same day shorn of its skirts. X think
men are much more nervous of “appearances
than are women—especially young men.
Only the other day a man was telling me about
an emotional actress whom he thought he adored
to melting-point, and who generally took her
walks abroad with a bull-dog in tow. One day
he met her in Bourke-street with the dog as usual,
and she stopped and smiled on him and he felt
that Heaven was just round the corner until
thing happened to her tackle which necessitated
both hands. “Will you take the chain for a
minute?” she said sweetly, and that hapless youth
took it, of course, and wandered away by her side
through a crowd of “barracking” bookmakers
with the waddling pup towing along behind and
the whole street looking over its shoulder at the
ghastly spectacle. The episode cured him or his
admiration for his bright particular sta,r, and after
that, when he saw her coming, he fled across the
street. Bub he says to-day that he would far
rather walk down the street towing two pups for
a lanky actress with yellow hair than run the
gauntlet of Tattersall’s with a woman in knicker-
bockers.
The Sydney Women’s College is a fashion-
able fraud. Two years have now elapsed
since its first formation, and but six students
—only one or two payers, the others bur-
saresses or holders of scholarships. Over
100 female students at the University, and
only six at the College! Why ? Because the
girls who really need residence are excluded by
reason of the high fees, and a building has been
erected costing =616,000 to accommodate—26
students! And these will either have to get in
for nothing or be from the ranks of the rich. The
girl working hard, or, in many cases, earning her
living at the same time as she studies for future
bread-earning, must still get along as best she may
in cheap lodging-houses, while thesix luxuriatein

A large audience attended the recent funeral-
service conducted by Mr. Galton at Sydney
Women’s Literary Society the other evening.
A funeral service in more ways than one, for surely
it is the death-blow to the W.L.S. as a women’s
society to have a course of lectures by men, those
obnoxious animals whose attempted introduction
provoked such a storm a few months ago. Ihe
members most rabid at that time are now the
leaders in arranging these masculine discourses.
Mr. Galton must have felt the solemnity of the
occasion, for he adopted the orthodox monotone
and never departed therefrom. The consequence
was somnolence on the part of some distinguished
visitors amongst the audience, and weariness on
the part of all; except those to whom Gov-
mentouse is so dear that even a drowsy lecture
by a G.H. young man is delight. Gov. Duff’s
secretary may be erudite and critical and so on,
bub he is no lecturer, A course of Galton might
be a specific for insomnia.
I hear that His Excellency of Tibipu had a de-
pressing experience during the recent rural raid.
It was at the undodgeable banquet, and H.E. was
on his dapper little feet hauling the silken bonds
as usual, and quite ignorant of the fact that the
favoured helot who kept the vice-regal goblet full
had been tipping the bottle in his own direction.

in is to pull out the vice-regal chair when the
Governor rises, and slide it back again to receive
him when he proceeds to sib down. On this occa-
sion the elevated retainer pulled it from under
with quite a flourish, but quite forgot the return
journey ! So when His Ex. gracefully endea-
voured to re-seat himself amid tumultuous applause
his countenance assumed the sad, inquiring ex-
pression of a man feeling for the twentieth stair in
a flight of nineteen, and then he shot under the
table. It is a point to be noted with complacency
by the great man’s relatives that he didn’t grab
the table-cloth in the hour of peril as do base-born
clowns when they try to sit on a chair that isn’t
there, but went helplessly to his doom without
hauling after himself a shower of dessert. Never-
theless, the gallery, which had the best view of the
tragedy, almost suffocated itself with its Sunday
handkerchief.
People are never tired of contrasting the ex*
with the present Governor —and never to the latter’s
advantage, so far as I can hear. Even on the
philosophically-disposed bowling-greens where
mellow manhood calmly amuses itself and only
worries to get ahead of the pitch, Lord Jersey is
still quoted with regret. Not that Governor Duff
hasn’t “done” the bowling-greens, but it was a
duty-visit to testify to their respectability. At one
suburban green he sab on the club-verandah in
stony silence, glared at the players, yawned
often, and bolted after 25 minutes. There are
several good judges of the opinion, by the way,
that the Duff gape, if measured, would beat the
Oarington yawn by several inches—though, of
course, that has nothing to do with my text.
Apropos of ex-Gov. Oarington, whose memory is
kept green in Australia by the presence of brother
Rupert. I wonder if everybody knows that he
will be succeeded in the title by his other brother,
Colonel Carrington, an old guardsman with a
pretty American wife among his chattels, and not
by the plump and pleasing Honourable who has
cast his matrimonial lot amongst us? It is diffi-
cult to see just where brother Rupert comes in,
when you picture that Colonel patiently waiting
for his turn to drive the family coach.
At one time there were by-paths of frivolity
that the she-reformer hesitated to follow up ; but
nowadays the second Mrs. T. (in her married
aspect) might wear out a dozen five o’clock tea-
sets entertaining the stream of Blue Ribbon old
women arriving every second anjJ fourth Thursday
to argue with her about the Ten Commandments.
The dubious doors that open unto, and shut upon,
the flat heels of Mrs, TabithaHaybag, W.O.T.TJ.,
suggest that the wages of sin are simply print to
the Kerristian sisterhood, and meanwhile tne
other side slaps the servant-girl in vain tor ad-
mitting the reformer, who has as many disguises
as a half-crown “super.”
And, apropos of woman’s suffrage—they say
that if Australian women ever do get a vote, the
first reform they will agitate for will be fancy
edges to the ballot papers and pink ribbons in
place of red tape.
I hear that during the various meetings of the
National Society for Women’s Suffrage at Mel-
bourne it was deplored that none of those most
interested could spare the time necessary for sec-
retarial duties until a recent day, when one of the
ladies said she would undertake the work at a
salary. The “ swell ” members were not averse to
the proposal, and the moment after payment had
been mooted it was found that nearly every
member was anxious to be secretary—even those
who had been most emphatic in protesting that
they could not possibly find time for the work.
Yours faithfully,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Melbourne Confidences.
Melbourne, May 7, 1894.
Bishop Webber was once driven round Central
Bananaland in a four-in-hand, dismounting at all
the humpies en route to administer “Holy
Baptism,” &c. In most cases, an unpretending-
parson of one denomination or another had visited 1
the inmates, on his nag, regularly every three
months, for years past. But that was a different
matter When a sunburnt mother, with half-a-
dozen youngsters clinging to her skirts, beheld an
imposing equipage dash up to her door, and a
dapper individual tightly encased in a strange,
unknown garb of apron and gaiters descended and
proceeded to put the family through their theo-
logical facings, she generally forgot who Adam
was, while the small fry lifted up their voices and
howled in unison when commanded to repeat the
39 articles. Nevertheless, the household would be
speedily regenerated and received into “the only
Apostolic Church,” and soon would find them-
selves gazing, open-mouthed, after the departing
vehicle, wondering if the whole proceeding was a
vision.
Bishop Webber has a flowing beard, which is
the very apple of his eye, and that reminds me
that in St. Paul’s Cathedral, the other day, as
the procession of clergy passed, one sassiety
woman was heard asking another whether she
didn’t doat on Mr. Tucker’s beautiful beard.
“ No,” replied her companion, “ I loathe beards.
Only hoary Patriarchs should be allowed to wear
them.”
Rev. Horace Tucker, the subject of the above
discussion, can boast of other advantages besides
his liberal growth of chin foliage. As well as
being an authority on Village Settlement and the
author of that much - discussed book, “ New
Arcadia,” he is the new bishop’s brother-in-law.
Popular Mrs. Green, who was Miss Mattie
Tucker, married “Grafton and Armidale” when
he was only a curate, wherefore her present feel-
ings can be better imagined than described.
Brother Tucker, now I think of it, tells a story
indicating that the visits of a ministering angel are
not always received with cheers. One day, during
a parochial round of visits, he was shown into the
best room and left there for an unconscionably
long time. At last, thinking the maid must have
forgotten to inform her mistress of his arrival, he
suggested to a tiny girl who chanced to be prowl-
ing in his vicinity, that she should go and tell her
mother that the representative of the Word was
cooling his heels. The little one went off, but
soon returned. “ Hid you tell her ? ” asked the
visitor. “Ess,” lisped his messenger. “And
what did she say?” enquired complacent Mr. T.
“Oh hozzer!” replied the innocent calmly. The
shepherd hove a sigh, and the tick of the clock on
the mantel sounded more solemn than ever.
The Ballarat church-people, being naturally
elated at the honour conferred on their late incum-
bent, have signified to that effect by the purchase
of a toney set of silver entree dishes, to be pre-
sented to Dr. Green on the occasion of a final and
farewell visit to his former parish. Evidently he
is expected to gladden his career in the lonely
bush with a few experiments in French cookery.
The work in a fashionable Toorak mansion is
done by a band of “ lady helps,” who perform all
the duties of servants at reduced rates. When the
day’s toil is over they don evening toilettes and
appear in the drawing-room, where they serve to
entertain visitors, many of whom are personal
friends of their own.
Another case of the same kind is that of the two
daughters of a departed Oollins-street doctor. One
of these girls is cook, and the other housemaid, in
a friend’s menage, and they also, when dinner is
accomplished, shed the garb of servitude, and for
a few short hours bask in society more congenial
than that of pots and pans.
A Melb. lady, noted for her hospitality and
activity with the Temperance racket, is at pre-
sent paying a visit to her relatives in Sydney, one
of whom (her brother) is the leader of the N.S.
Wales Opposition. It comes almost as a matter
of course to hear that she has been conducting
white-ribbon meetings on ships around the Beauti-
ful Harbour, for the inexhaustible energy of this
reformer is ever finding vent in original under-
takings. Her garden-parties are unique, as besides
the “ top-notes ” of her acquaintance en masse,
she invites all the dear good creatures she can pos-
sibly lay her hands on. The latter assemble them-
selves in marquees, where they preach, sing and
pray, or canvass for total sobriety in the most
wholesale way, much to the embarrassment of
worldlings who, entering by accident, are taken
unawares.
When Mdme. Sterling was here, the subject of
the last paragraph bore her off in triumph to her
expensive suburban home and collected everyone
she had ever heard of tohear thegreatmusic-groaner
hold forth in the local tabernacle. She found
she had caught a Tartar, for the emancipated
Antoinette, choosing her text, “Take a little wine
for thy stomach’s sake,” set to work to prove that
there were no such organs as stomachs—they
existed only in our imaginations, and consequently
we didn’t need to take any of the apostolic sher-
bet at all. But, as Gracie Whiteford used to
sing in “I’ll write it on my little slate,” “I
couldn’t tell you half the things she said.” Some
of them were truly shocking, though a maiden of
my acquaintance vowed that the discourse was
better than a French novel from a railway book-
stall.
One can’t help noticing that women speakers*
be the subject what it may, are fond of verging on
the risque, perhaps to show they have got beyond
weak, womanly scruples. The male doctor lectur-
ing to ambulance associations, etc., wouldn’t shock
the sensibilities of Richardson’s “Pamela,” but
when Aunt went to hear an American lady
physician, her nose was crimson for a week after-
wards with the burning blushes of outraged
modesty, as she expresses it. The lecture was so
warm, very warm-
Again, a temperance drawing-room gathering u
always a grand field-day for elderly to
hint at dark and deadly temptations which
assailed them in their innocent and beautiful
youth, even though one feels certain the tempter
resolutely kept away from them at aU periods.
“ The magnificent arms and shoulders, etc., ot
girls, who have come to the slums through the
insinuating bottle, is another favourite chestnut
on such occasions. This is fired off with panto-
mimic gestures and much expressive pawing or
their own full-blown anatomies, so as to give what
they consider point to the spicy warning.
A well-known Melbourne resident is aquerulou 8
old squatter, who, unlike most fathers, has shown
a rabid disinclination to allow his daughters to
marry. One by one they have left the parental
roof under circumstances of hurry and worry. The
last was wooed by a N.S.W. resident, and alter
much warfare the father at length consented, ihis
circumstance was so unusual that the principals
decided to get married at once, and after the deed
was done they advised the old man by wire, he
being then in Sydney. When the bride and bride-
groom reached Red fern station, the first to greet
them was the irate father, who knocked his son-
in-law down and gave him a black eye as a
souvenir of the joyful occasion. Meanwhile, a
Melbourne man, scion of a very well-known family,
who was paying his addresses to a younger sister,
has abandoned his suit until he becomes more
proficient in the art which Peter Jackson adorns.
VAN M.
A New Phase of Monopoly.
Day by day we see the old belief—
“ The simple plan
That he should take who has the power,
And he should keep who can,”
Receiving increasing opposition from an un-
ceasingly intelligent democracy. In the old
feudal days a man created his vested interests by
some kind of strength, even if that strength were
dishonourably used. At the tail end of the nine-
teenth century we see the mentally and physically
weak monopolising light and air and water, and
existing on the ignorance of the masses. Land is
given to men who never intend to work it, so that
the State may buy it back for railway purposes.
The State, instead of providing its people
with artificial lights, gives a monopolistic
concession to a syndicate which can force
the community to buy the syndicate’s wares
at the syndicate’s own price. And the
only good thing about these monopolies is that
they are terminable at some date or other. There
is only one inevitable and changeless monopoly,
and that is Death, which owns every human, from
tribune to scavenger, and from poet to plumber.
The usual commercial monopoly says, “ Give me
75 per cent, of your labour and your life.” Death
says, “ 100 per cent, of your existence is mine by
inalienable right.” The day for that settling must
come—it is inevitable—but we may put it off
almost indefinitely by strict attention to the laws
of health. The large percentage of premature
deaths are caused by some phase of liver and kid-
ney trouble, but Warner’s Safe Cure is an abso-
lute specific for Bright’s disease, liver, kidney and
other urinary troubles. We tell you that many
scores of thousands have had their lives lengthened
and their health restored by the use of the Safe
Cure. Our pamphlets contain numberless testi-
monies to the value of the Safe Remedies. They
are tried, conscientiously made, and sold on
honour as literal Safe Cures.
A judge-story. The witness was very
fetching, and the J. was uncommonly amorous.
So was the sheriff. The more the judge looked at
her the more he admired her; the more the
sheriff looked at her the more he admired her.
The judge scribbled a note: “ Come to my room
when the court adjourns.” The witness blushed
acquiescence. As she was leaving the box the
sheriff whispered in her ear ; “ Come to my room
when the court adjourns.” The witness blushed
again. She came ; and lingered perplexed in the
passage. Two heads popped out.of two doors;
the girl between them. The judge was the first to
take in the situation. “Come along, my dear,”
he said, beckoning her in. And, with a friendly
wave of his hand, as he banged the door : “After
me, after me, Mr. Sheriff—judgment before
execution !”

Mr. John George, miner, Hetherington, writes on
January 28th, 1893 :—For some time I have been
a great sufferer from weakness, owing to an illness
I had some years ago. At times after forcing
myself to eat I could not retain it on my stomach.
I became so ill at last that I found it impossible
to work at my trade as a miner for three days
running. A friend of mine who had derived
benefit from taking Clements Tonic, advised me
to try it. Well, sir, I am happy to say my strength
and appetite increased daily, and I have never
lost a day’s work since through illness. I am
only too happy to recommend it on all occasions to
those who are suffering from a weak and debili-
tated constitution.—Yours gratefully, John
George, miner, Hetherington, North Lambton,

At Melb. Hospital, the other day, they
had a case of that rare and curious disorder,
Pediculce Crustaciform Herodium —a species of
skin parasites, in common speech. Dr. Player
applied ice to the affected part, which is the
orthodox treatment, but when he examined the
case about an hour after he was surprised to find
no sign of the minute insects. A powerful micro
scope, however, discovered them retreated away
down at the bottom of the sores, where they were
trotting up and down in buttoned-up overcoats
and woollen comforters, flapping their arms across
their chests, and remarking to one another:
“ Blessed cold weather, isn’t it ?”
A. J. Wilson, on Jabez Balfour as the
scapegoat:—
Miserable Balfour, such is destiny 1 Almost we find it
in our heart to pity him, he was, after all, such a common
kind of sinner. Therein lies his misfortune. Could he
have but shaken himself clear of the Liberator group and
its unctuous connections a few years earlier, he might
to-day have been a Minister of State, concocting a
“ radical budget,” who knows, and doing it “ with much
acceptance,” as the dissenting diaconal phrase would run.
Too late he entered the City, and joined the “eminently
respectable ” there ; too late he won his parliamentary
triumph, too late came the offer of the baronetcy. For-
lorn Jabez ! When he thinks of these things he must at
times regret his modesty in refusing that baronetcy. It
might have saved him to-day. So many human frogs
would have been silenced by the sheen of a title who now
render the gloaming of an Empire’s day gruesome with
their monotonous oroakings of “ revenge, revenge.”

Itching Skin Humors
Torturing, Disfiguring Eczemas
And every species of itching, burning, bleeding, scaly, crusted, pimply,
and blotchy skin and scalp diseases are relieved in the majority
of cases by a single application, and speedily, permanently and
economically cured by the Cuticura
Remedies when the best physicians,
hospitals, and all other remedies fail.
No language can exaggerate the suf-
fering of those afflicted with these dis-
eases, especially of little babies, whose
tender skins are literally on fire.
CUTICURA
Remedies are the greatest skin
cures, blood purifiers, and humor reme-
dies of modern times, are absolutely
pure, and agreeable to the most sensi-
tive, and may be used on the youngest
infant and most delicate invalid with
gratifying and unfailing success.
Cuticura, the great skin cure, instantly allays

HORLIGK’S
MALTED
MILK.
A PERFECT FOOD,
An artificial food for Babies should
contain every element of nutrition in
proper proportion, in order that the
growing child may receive nourishment
that produces a normal and proportionate
growth of muscle, bone and flesh.
Horlick’s Malted Milk is such a food.
It is made of the best Cows’ Milk, com-
bined with Wheat and Barley, specially
prepared and adapted to the needs of the
Growing Baby, who, when fed upon it
(not over-fed ), is far less liable to attacks
of Cholera-Infantum and Marasmus than
when other artificial or any starchy
foods are used.
ffabi^s
Fed on Horlick’s Malted Milk (which
contains no starch) are always in good
health, and, consequently, never show
that crossness and peevishness which is
a sign of bad nutrition or ill-health.

GIRLS OF THE RIGHT SORT.
“ My daughter, unless you can work the ship off the
coast, the will soon strike the rocks, and we shall all
be lost.”
So said the captain of a fine merchant vessel to
his daughter. He was right; it was their only
chance. The bark Anina, 700 tons, was bound
from Ouxhaven to Rio with a general cargo. She
had scarcely left port when the captain was
disabled by a broken leg. A mutiny followed.
Under threat of bad weather the Anina anchored
in a bight of a bay on the dangerous coast of Corn-
wall. Here the officers andall of the crew deserted.
A furious cyclonic south-west gale arose. The
anchors dragged, and the girl burned a flare on
deck. The lifeboat responded, but was staved
against the ship’s side by a sea. All the boat’s
crew were lost except the coxswain, who gained
the deck. He was not a sailor, yet, with him
alone under her orders, this girl, who was a sailor,
cut both cables, set some headsail, and got out
into the open. It was touch and go, but true grit
won. Three weeks longer the girl commanded
before help came. Yet it did come finally, and
so did the wedding of the handsome youngcoxswain
and the captain’s beautiful and heroic daughter.
And yet there are some fools left who say we
must look to men chiefly for courage and intelli-
gence. Stuff and nonsense! Any woman will
scream when she sees a mouse (that’s mere nerves),
and ten minutes later she will meet disaster or
death with a quiet smile. Then, too, women
have a genius for throwing in a suggestion exactly
when it is wanted.
A man writes this way;—“ I came home de-
jected,” so he goes on, “and didn’t know what to
do ; but my daughter said ”
But wait a minute. Before we hear what his
daughter said, let’s have his story from the start,
shipshape and Bristol fashion. He says :—“ In
December, 1890, I was suddenly taken one day
with an excruciating pain in the pit of the stomach
and in the right side. For over twelve hours I
could neither sit nor lie down. The medical man
who examined me gave me some medicine, but on
the second day jaundice set in, and from that time
1 suffered from a similar attack about once every
three weeks. Every remedy was tried without
avail; nothing did the slightest good. Thekidney
secretion was something frightful, being a mass of
matter, blood, and bile.
“ This continued five months, and I grew weaker
and thinner every day. My friends thought
nothing could save me. Many urged me to have
further advice, as at this time the secretions were
much worse, and the motions resembled white
clay. Another attack came on, and as I was
daily getting worse, I said, ‘ I will see the doctor
first, and if he can do me no good, I will seek
further medical help.’
“ Accordingly I went to see him, but he was
from home, and would not return until late at
night. I came home dejected and did not know
what to do, but my daughter said, * Why don’t you
try Mother SeigeVs Curative Syrup? We hear it
has cured so many. If it does you no good it will
do no harm.’ ‘Well,’ I said to her, ‘ I will try a
bottle.’
“ I then began to take it, and oh ! how thankful
I afterwards was, for on the third day I could see
such a change. The secretion, instead of being
nothing but corruption, became clear, and the
motions a healthy colour. From that time I daily
gained health and strength, and in a short time I
was as well as ever in my life, and have had no
return of the disease.
“ I can, therefore, speak of this medicine in the
I i;hest terms, for, under God’s blessing, it cured
ms when nothing else had the slightest effect.”
The above communication is from a business
man of high character in the county of Brecon.
For especial reasons he desires his name to be
withheld for the present, but we freely pledge our
own reputation for the truth of his statement.
The date is February 12, 1892.
The attacks which would probably have soon
ended his life were of severe kidney and liver
congestion, growing out of profound indigestion
and dyspepsia. His system was flooded with bile
acid poisons, and he may thank Heaven for having
a daughter who made the right suggestion at a
critical moment. In courage and good sense she
i-t like the other noble girl who saved her father’s
ship from wreck while he lay helpless in his cabin.
Success attend them in their own life voyages,
say we.

Dear Bulletin, —The “ made -in - Ger-

but why?—in still, small type “Made in Ger-

Hume Nisbet’s new book, “A Bush Girl’s
Romance,” is called by the English press “the
best story of Australian bushranging since
‘Robbery Under Arms.”’ The leader of a mur-
derous band of miscreants, to whom the Kellys
were mere apologies, is, in the story, appointed an
inspector of police, and the second, third and
fourth murderers are constables, who alternately
out travellers’ throats and yell out “Silence in
th’ Coort!” For a howling parody of Australian
life the “ Bush Girl’s Romance ” takes the palm.
It is, therefore, likely to be a huge success—in
England.
Another story of “ good old Jacky Dow,”
the bane of don’t-want-work-shirkers. Jacky,
asked for work, told applicant to go over to a big
patch of scrub, hunt for a lost bullock and not
return till dinner-time. At tucker-hour, Jacky
interviewed him: “Find the bullock?” “No,
boss.” “Did ye look in all the likely places?”
“Yes, boss.” “Well, get your grub and then
go and look in all the unlikely ones.” Two hours
later, the bullock-prospector was found by Jacky,
lying on his back under a big messmate tree.
“ What are you doing ? You’re not looking
for that bullock,” yelled Jacky. “You‘don’t
want work, I can see.” “Yes I do, boss; I’m
obeyin’ orders. You told me to search in all the
unlikely spots, so I’m looking for the blessed cow
up this ’ere tree.”

Dear Bulletin,— “ A.G.” tells me my
man and wife love-story generalisation doesn’t hit
it. “ They do have children who are killed off (a)
partly for artistic reasons. ... (6) partly for
moral reasons, because it would be dangerous to
let children grow up in the company of such
parents,” (a) I said, and “A.G.” doesn’t and
can’t dispute it, that Art is malleability. (&)
Would such parents as “Price Warung” draws,
in “At the Feet of His Fame,” be unfit com-
panions for a child ? Besides physiology refutes
such a peculiar doctrine. My contention remains
intactNo one has yet turned up who is able to
handle a child in such a tale. “A.G.,”in his
instances, somehow seems to wander from the
type I indicated. —D.W.
Sydney Daily Telegraph, sympathising
with the Buda-Pesth reporters, wonders why
Sydney newspapers don’t contrive to similarly
boycott offending politicians. The reasons why it
cannot be overtly done are numerous, but does
not the Sydney press do it covertly all the year
round ? Now that the telephone is at work you
can, any night Parliament sits, hear this sort of
thing: “Brown’s talking.” “Put him into an
inch.” “Smith is going a hurricane.” “Say
‘ Mr. Smith also spoke.’ ” “ Jones is good for an
hour.” “ Boil him into three lines.”, “ There’s a
discreditable fight among the Labour-party.”
“ Lay the whole staff on and miss nothing,” The
Buda-Pesth reporters are mere novices in boy-
cotting methods.
Don’t fish for sharks in a rain-barrel
but print your advertisement where it will be seen. “In
my travels in Australia I found Tub Bulletin every-
where, and everywhere found it powerful,” wrote David
Christie Murray in the London Contemporary Review.
That is true. The universality of The Bulletin’s circula-
tion in Australasia is the envy of all other papers. In and
beyond Australia, The Bulletin, now in its fourteenth
year of issue, is the most popular, best-known, best-
quoted, and most widely and numerously circulated of all
Australasian publications.
The night of depression is passing away,
A truce to all sorrow and pining ;
For high in the sky, lately gloomy and gray,
The sun will be presently shining—
Presently pleasantly shining.

So stocks must go up in a week, at the most—
You’ll get it reported by cable.
Chords:

An interesting sight;
Give him all the gas you can,
To make a shining light.
He crossed the sea to save you fronTyour present
evil plight,
And, begorra 1 he began on Monday marning.
His tall, shiny cadey has burst on the scene,
His cheeks are a little bit paler;
His garments denote he has stealthily been
To a smart, representative tailor—
A toney New Babylon tailor.
He’s ready and eager to rise in hia place
At any big banqueting table,
And when he addresses “My Lord,” or “Your

You’ll get it reported by cable.
Gillies is on the job again,
A-bursting with delight,
Perverting truths Australian,
And swearing black is white.
He crossed the sea to have a spree, and soothe his
appetite,
And, begorra ! he began on Monday marning.
One can’t tell exactly how Gillies will serve
The land that has kept him in clover,
But he’ll stick to his billet with wonderful nerve,
Until the depression is over—
Victoria’s troubles are over.
He’ll call at the office and stand at the door
To show the finances are stable,
And when he does nothing he’ll finish at four
And get it reported by cable.
Gillies is in the air again,
So things are looking bright j
He’s the sort of leading man
A title can requite.
He crossed the sea plain Duncan G., but means to
be a knight,
And, begorra ! he began on Monday marning.

The March of the Flood.
[FOR THE BULLETIN].
There’s a whisper away on the Queensland side
Of the Barwon a banker, the Warrego wide
Spread from range to red range, of the siege of a
town,
Of farms that are wasted and cattle that drown,
Of a trackless road and a bridgeless sea,
And grey miles measured from tree to tree—
And the people gather at gate and rail
For the latest news by the Darling mail.
Through all the merry daylight
Long leagues behind her fall
Till golden turns to gray light
And wedding-robe to pall;
Above her rolling thunder |
The shrieking parrots fly,
And the bush-world waits to wonder
When the Darling mail goes by.
Through all the night she spurns the ground,
Her headlights shame the stars,
The rolling dust-cloud wraps her round
From ledge to leading bars,
And, like some half-roused sleeper,
Stands each gaunt-armed gum aghast,
And the shadows gather deeper
When the Darling mail goes past.
She takes the fearsome message down
By reach and point and bend,
And camp and farm and river town
Will hail her as a friend ;
For comes she not as horsemen ride
Who ride a race to win ?
What wonder if they crowd beside
When the Darling mail comes in ?
And close behind is the fierce Flood-King,
In the pride of his strength he comes
Where the tangled masses of drift-weed swing
Like dead men up in the gums;
He sings the paean of curbless might
And the song of a broken chain,
And he rides himself in the foremost fight
With the scourge of a loose-held rain.
He throws an arm to the southward now,
Now an arm to the golden west,
A.nd the circled lives to his bidding bow
And are lost on his tawny breast.
And day by day as he thunders by
There is ground to be captive led,
And night by night where the lowlands lie
Are the wings of his army spread.
There’s never the stem of a bankfed tree
For the touch of his hand too tall,
And he leaves his brand for the world to see
On the hut and the homestead wall.
There’s never a star in the midnight sky
Or a sunbeam crossing the morn
But has heard the boast of his battle-cry
And the threat of his bugle-horn.
• • * • •
And down where the Queen of the River lies girt
with her garland of green
The toilers have heard it and tremble, whose
wealth is the life of the Queen;
In the hush of the evening they hear his low beat
on the shield of the shore
And stand to the dam and the earthwork; they
know it his challenge of yore !
And the stockmen ride out in the dawnlight by
billabong, runner and creek
To gather the sheep and the cattle wherever his
war-notes speak,
And the blood will be red on the rowel, the sun
will be low in the west
Before they have left them in safety to camp on
the red hill’s crest.
And so we shall live and suffer so long as the big
rains come
With their ruin and wreck for many, their danger
and death for some,
Till we go from the Culgoa and Darling to camp
on a drier shore
Where the Warrego out in his warpaint shall harry
our homes no more 1

Two Corporation Men.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tom Jackson and Jack Thompson were corpora-
tion men. Tom was married, but had no children.
Jack was single, and volunteered to act as child;
so they let him the back room, and he had meals
with them. There wasn’t much luxury in that
house. Tom knew the road in the dark to every
pub. for miles around. Mrs. Tom also was not
unfamiliar with the kitchens of several accom-
modation resorts. So, between them, they kept
the pocket clean, and the butcher waiting. Jack
didn’t drink much. He had a drop with Mrs.
Tom—occasionally—in the house.
Tom was a quiet and slow character, inclining
to obesity. Took a long time to see a thing ; but
when he did, he did. So he began to notice that
Jack was always at home when he came. Un-
suspicious as he usually was, he couldn’t help
thinking. He was not over-scrupulous as to his
feminine company, but it had never occurred to
him that his wife might be lax in a similar direc-
tion. So he took to staying at home some. Must
have been coincidental, for Jack was never at
home. Then Tom grew careless again. Then
again cautious. One night he came home drunk—
sham drunk.
That closed the evidence for the prosecution.
Tom said never a word. Things went on much
as usual. If anything, Tom was quieter, except
that he got drunk oftener.
One day Tom and Jack were doing a suburban
street. Terribly hot it was—lo 3 in the shade —
and not a soul to be seen. They worked slowly
up to the corner grating. Jack swept and Tom
piled, and both perspired. Jack lifted the grating
off. A bad word floated away on the hot air and
both men mopped their faces and relieved the can
of some beer. Something was blocking the drain
below, and the flue was slowly filling, of course.
They had no scoop with them and it was nearly a
mile to the shed. Tom tried to shift the obstruc-
tion with a shovel.
“Some young (this and that) has chucked a
stone in,” he growled. “You’ll have to go and
get a rake, I s’pose.”
“ Too infernally hot,” muttered Jack. “ How
much water?”
“ About four foot.”
“ I’ll go down.”
They wiped their faces. Not a breath of air.
Fearful day. Jack went on his stomach, and Tom
took his feet and slowly let Jack down head-first.
Tom gave a start. His eyes dilated and he
quivered. If he let go? A wave of heat swept
along, and he fell back.
Heat apoplexy—accidentally drowned.
TOM GAYNDAH.
Selling' Scripture Texts.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
There are many different ways of making a living;
but selling Scripture texts is not one of them. I
discovered this in two days. A friend who frames
pictures in Sydney gave me some nice little works
of art with a passage of Scripture in one corner,
and I started out to supply a long-felt want. I
always thought that when people are up to their
eyes in debt and trouble would be the right time
to drop in with some nice little texts, setting forth
that “ The Lord will provide,” &c. It seems not.
But I should have sold more if I had only known
what part of the town the Christians live in. I’m
satisfied of that. As soon as I find that out I
intend to make money. I met some queer people,
though, for a person who doesn’t know the town.
One of them is the woman who tells you, after a
lot of talk, that she has a house-full of pictures—
more than she has room to hang up; and just then
one of the children opens the door wide and you
discover that the walls are perfectly bare, except-
ing here and there a large, red spot where some
robust bed-insect paused abruptly. And I like the
woman who opens the door and smiles. When you
put your pictures down on the door-step and start
to clear your throat, she slams the door and
knocks your pictures right to the bottom of the
steps. Your throat clears very suddenly just
here, and you quote Scripture which isn’t on the
texts. This person always lives in a fine big
house, being a lady.
After a ew of these confidential interviews, I
ceased to wonder how anarchists were built. I
have a recipe which would make an anarchist of
Job. If this meets the eye of any anarchist who
wishes to begin work in Sydney, I will be glad to
point out some houses which 1 think could be
blown to pieces conveniently, and at little cost.
I hate to see any man out of work.
Then there is the Salvation woman, who reads
your texts over in a scared voice as though afraid
of stepping on her creed, and tells you to
“Remember what them says.” Every minute
at that house is time heaved away. The Sunday-
school teacher—ditto. I think a lot of the man
who sits smoking his pipe on the back verandah,
and, when you come to the side-gate and ask if
that dog will bite, says, “Sometimes.” A second
glance at the house convinces you that the people
in there don’t know a nice, neat picture when they
see it. Consequently, they don’t see it.
I also met the man who said “he got some of
them scripture things once, but the kids knocked ”
—well, a very tropical place—“out of them.”
Yes, I met some queer people. In fact, the only
people I didn’t meet were the people who wanted
some nice, little religious pictures. If the apostle
Paul himself were here now, he would soon knock
off selling scripture texts, and start out with
“The Life of the Kelly Boys,” or “Bushranging in
Australia.” Then he might make a living.
BOILING BILLY.

Pattie Brown was once travellingin a CoJliris-
street tram when a frowsy old woman entered and
sat down beside her. When the conductor came
to collect fares, the old woman made no prepara-
tion to pay, and so, when Pattie handed him six-
pence, he said—“ Two ?” “Do / look like two /"
asked Pattie, in tones that made the tram-man
tremble, while all the other passengers turned
away to laugh.
Dear Bulletin, —lie the appointment of
Miss Amy Castilla, M. 8., 8.5., Melbourne, to a
general hospital, it may interest people to learn that
Melb. Hospital established a boycott against lady
students. Miss Castilla, and also Miss Stone, who
was not allowed to take her house-surgeoncy at the
hospital this year, because she wasn’t a student of
that institution, and couldn’t have been one
although she wished it, were amongst the first
batch of lady students to whose rescue the
medical staff of the Alfred Hospital came.
Now, it is distinctly within the writer’s re",
collection that the ladies’ class at the
Alfred declared as one man (or woman, rather)
that under no consideration did they intend to
practice general medicine or special surgery, but
would, on taking their degrees, devote them-
selves to the diseases of women and children.
With such an understanding arrived at with the
staff, when their medical curriculum was about
to begin, clinical instruction in certain branches of
surgery and medicine was dispensed with for
various reasons. But the examiners could draw
no such lines of demarcation, and as these ladies
passed their exams, creditably, it is to be reason-
ably inferred that they must have perfected them-
selves in the tapu subjects somehow or other.
Without clinical experience in every branch of the
healing art, however, no man or woman can be
house-surgeon to a general hospital, and things
must have altered greatly in the southern capital
to cause the lady-doctors to find it necessary
to go back on their original undertaking
and now turn to billets at general hospitals.
There are, as you say, unexplainable reasons why
house-surgeons should not be chosen from amongst
the fair sex. The field of diseases of women and
children they are welcome to if they can hold it
for their own, which is doubtful, nor have they the
physique necessary for obstetric practice. lam
not drawing comparisons in view of the results of
certain recent experiments, but look here ! the
master of the Rotunda Hospital, in Dublin (the
greatest institution of the kind in the world) has
to reside for seven years on the premises without
a holiday, the assistant masters hold office for
three years and have to pay .£lOO a year, besides
their mess charges, for the privilege of being there
at all, and there are some three outdoor cases for
each one in the house, work going on night and
day. How’s that, umpire? N.B. —There is
gravel in this if it be sifted.—Yours, Banshee.
