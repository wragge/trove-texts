NEW ELIOT PLAY
T. S. Eliot’s new play, The Elder
Statesman (Faber), first performed at
Edinburgh in August of last year, is
as precise and nervous as the type
it’s set in; very cold and bare, like one
of the Roman plays he’s supposed to
be fond of (the reviewer, not knowing
Seneca, can’t say); but certainly
stripped of any Christian comfort such
as is to be found, say, in “The Cock-
tail Party.”
Maybe this is because Eliot can
hardly present his elder statesman as
a Christian. Son of a rich man, a
careerist, he has climbed into the
aristocracy and has retired early be-
cause his doctor told him to, adding
secretly, to the statesman’s devoted
daughter, that he’ll be lucky to see
the year out. So the daughter accom-
panies her father to a sanatorium so
costly that it doesn’t look like a
sanatorium at all. In this sanctuary,
where he is supposed to be protected
from worry, he is dogged by two
revengers out of his past.
One is Gomez from South America,
who turns out to be Fred Culverwell,
a former poor student at Oxford whom
the statesman, in his student days, had
encouraged in high-living. Fred forged
cheques to keep up with the Joneses,
was jailed, and on his enlargement
given passage to South America by
the statesman. He has done well there,
and returned to remind the statesman
that they were in a car together when
they ran-down an old man, and that
the statesman hadn’t stopped. The
other revenger is a rich widow stay-
ing at the sanatorium. She and the
statesman were to have been married
when they were young, but his father
had broken the affair up and given
the girl a start on the stage. She has
letters, and doesn’t mind telling the
statesman that some people would
pay a lot of money for them.
Neither wants money; they are more
dangerous than blackmailers, they are
aggrieved persons, the man because he
has been encouraged and got rid of,
and the woman for the same reason;—
Blackmail? Yes, I’ve heard that
word before,
Not so very long ago. When I asked
him what he wanted.
Oh no, he said, I want nothing from
you
Except your friendship and your
company.
He’s a very rich man. And she’s a
rich woman.
If people merely blackmail you to
get your company
I’m afraid the law can’t touch them.
But they want more than friendship
and company; they want revenge, and
when the statesman’s scapegrace son
visits him to ask him to get him
out of another mess they see their
opportunity: Gomez, to get the young
man to America under the same kind
of patronage as the statesman had
extended to Gomez; the widow to
secure from the son as a gigolo the
affection denied her by his father. And
indeed, faced by his son’s defection,
the statesman dies suddenly, with a
typical Eliot epitaph, spoken by his
daughter to her fiance;—
We will go to him together. He is
close at hand,
Though he has gone too far to re-
turn to us.
He is under the beech tree. It is
quiet and cold there.
In becoming no one, he has become
himself . . ,
“Quiet and cold” is right. One spoke
before of Roman tragedy—it is for
experts to say whether Eliot is here
more Roman or Greek. He used the
Furies in “The Family Reunion” and
here he is like enough taking the
Chorus into the body of the play, as
social blackmailers; he practically
says so: —
Because they are not real, Charles.
They are merely ghosts:
Spectres from my past. They’ve
always been with me
Though it was not till lately that I
found the living persons
Whose ghosts tormented me, to be
only human-beings,
Malicious, petty, and 1 see myself
emerging
From my spectral existence into
something like reality.
Humanised, the chorus has the same
effect upon the audience as deper-
sonalised in Greek tragedy; the cold
feeling of having seen the lid quietly
lifted off hell, of having witnessed the
destruction of a man of sufficient size
to be destroyed; of inevitability.
And to this end, this tragedy seems
to suit Eliot’s verse better than do
any of his other plays. It'is a mistake
to think that dramatic poetry needs
to be decorated and hung with meta-
phors; without ornamentation it can
still set voices to unvarying phrases;
and in this simple use of verse Eliot
is more at home than in such windy
choruses as those of “The Rock” and
“Murder in the Cathedral,” or than
in setting to music such tea-party
Christianity as that of “The Cocktail
Party.”
Whether the play will interest as
many people as “The Cocktail Party”
remains to be seen. There, he exposed
a brilliant, and to this age startling,
idea, that there were people incapabfe
of love—a lot of worried people must
have been consoled by that. There
must be quite as many people to be
consoled about social blackmail, real
or imagined. Whether they make
much of his play or not. he has once
more put poetry into the service of
a powerful and contemporary per-
ception.

Saroyan Strikes Again
The human race, says William
Saroyan in the preface to his new play
The Cave Dwellers (Faber), is so sick
that now “health itself is recognised
as a dull form of sickness.” What
ought man to do, then? “Precisely
what he has always done—nothing,
with flourishes ... As a little of my
share I wrote this play. Enjoy it, it’s
good for you.”
Saroyan’s nothing with flourishes is
about a bunch of broken - down
creatures—an actor, an actress, a
boxer, a vagrant girl, a man and his
wife with a new-born boy and a per-
forming bear—sheltering in an aban-
doned theatre. The little struggles of
these people for bread, love and
dreams before their theatre is
demolished provide a vehicle for
Saroyan’s special brand of undramati-
cally theatrical comment on the human
condition, showing him at once at his

THE RED-HERRING FAMINE
TpHE biennial conference of the
A Federal A.L.P. has provided plenty
of evidence that the party has become
a living skeleton, smeared with mud.
For many years, both in its Federal
and State manifestations, it has lived
on the ability of State Labor Govern-
ments and municipalities to bribe con-
stituents, plant public works and
housing-schemes in strategic electoral
positions and gerrymander electoral
boundaries. With vast civil services
and the power to offer baits and
bonuses for votes to workers, these
conscienceless State Administrations
have been the votewinners who have
kept Labor going.
The Federal section of the party,
out on a Parliamentary lee-shore for
a decade, has merely been a poor
relation of the State branches, snatch-
ing what it could get of the fat.
When the Federal Labor Govern-
ment was in office it pursued the same
policy as the State Governments like
the Cahill Government, pandering to
the civil service (which it inflated to
suit its political ends), wooing the
women’s vote and Communist sup-
port by destroying defence and carry-
ing on a rousing campaign of backing
for the Communist party and its right
to be considered a genuine political
party instead of the traitorous, foreign-
directed conspiracy which it is. By
shrill invective, by the stirring-up of
greed and hate and envy, by tolerating
the blackmarketeer and perpetuating
the war-time tyrannies which gave it
Moscow-like power, and rallying the
have-nots against the haves, it did
very well until it went too far on the
banking - issue. Then it was thrown
out. and has ever since lived, ragged
and half-naked, partly on the reflected
glory and patronage of the State
parties in office and partly on its
limited store of red-herrings, which
have now run out, so that it can sur-
vive only by picking-over cast-away
fishbones from the midden.
Now State Labor Governments are
being quickly liquidated, and State
branches will soon be in the same -
position as the Federal party, except
in N.S.W., where Mr. Cahill’s hard-
won victory has almost exhausted his
ingenuity in political bribery, though
it has earned him a reprieve from
political execution.
Tasmania also survives in office by
dint of the p.-r. electoral system and
the mercy of the Liberal party and/or
Dr. Turnbull in an atmosphere of
disgrace.
But even the two surviving Labor
Administrations are likely to have
little time or sustenance to give to the
support of Federal Labor or little
inclination to associate themselves
with a Commonwealth manifestation
with the sorry record of the Federal
A.L.P.
In fact. Labor as a party survives
at all only by living in compartments.
If Mr. Cahill had raised the banner
of mateship in the interest of Dr.
Evatt’s tattered army during the
Federal campaign he would not be in
office today. He would certainly have
lost the Catholic vote, which carried
him in.
So while Dr. Evatt hawked his
Catholic Action conspiracy, allegedly
aimed to subvert the Labor branches
and capture the party, Mr. Cahill and
his merry men canvassed for all they
were worth the idea that they were
the sterling friends of the church and
enemies of Communism though, of
course, perfectly willing to accept
directions and finance from bodies
which were either under the control
of Communists or riddled with Com-
munists.
TTAVING lost the Federal election,
A and seen how successful Mr. Cahill
was through making gestures to
Groupers and their friends and pro-
testing that Communists were
anathema to him, Dr. Evatt imme-
diately turned over and found the
Communist alliance which had
financed him and supported his
heresy - hunt against the Catholic
Action elements as a “running sore”
in the party which must be excised
if the party were to be saved.
This procedure has, of course, put
the politbureau of the party, the
Federal A.L.P. Executive, and its
central committee, the Federal con-
ference these two bodies being
analogous to the two controlling-
juntas of the Soviet Union on which
they appear to be modelled—in a tight
spot. It was weaned to a Communist-
guided policy in line with that of
Moscow at the Hobart conference—a
policy which aimed to subvert defence
and follow a plan to come closer to
the Communist countries, recognise
Red China, welcome Soviet Russia as
a first-line friend and India as our
inspiration, treating all opponents of
the Left as conspirators.
Now it finds itself meeting with
the naked aims of Red China exposed
in Tibet and the Middle East and
with most State branches leaning to
the Right for all they are worth in
a desperate attempt to keep on the
safe side of a vast block of anti-
communist votes. So Dr. Evatt has
tried to lean to the Right, too, as hard
as he can, and the members of the
junta outside Parliament find that they
cannot lean anywhere without frighten-
ing a decisively large section of Labor
voters almost to death. Their main
effort, therefore, continues to be
directed towards distracting attention
from all the main issues which they
should be debating.
With the Hobart programme pad-
locked round their necks, along with
their support of Dr. Evatt’s anti-
Catholic campaign. they cannot
swerve to the Right. With their only
hope at next election (Federal, State
or municipal) the D.L.P. vote, they
can’t consolidate on the Left.
""THERE are great issues which could,
and should, be discussed. There is,
for instance, the drive for the abolition
or reform of the arbitration system;
but the split among their supporters
is so wide that they can only mutter
under their breaths about it. There
is the matter of automation and
mechanisation of coalmines; but this
can’t be raised without vitally involv-
ing the State Governments in the
most embarrassing controversies over
responsibility for employment and the
whole of the unions in a rousing dog-
fight over bonuses and incentive-
payments and the rationalisation of
employment.
The fact is that wages-control is
now out of the hands of the union-
bosses in most big unions and in the
hands of the rank-and-file, who are
rapidly being lured to become sup-
porters of the bonus- and incentive-
systems in preference to the party
policy which teaches that loaf is the
ultimate ideal of free men.
Most sensible workers are coming
to realise that in automation and elec-
tronics, industry has developed an
effective weapon against loaf and in-
dustrial strife. The idea has not yet
penetrated the brains of the more
extreme disruptionists, such as those
on the waterside; but the majority are
learning that if they don’t keep up
production under an incentive system,
the way is open through machines for
employers to keep it up without them.
It seems that the A.L.P. has reached
the point of last resort. The only
aggressiveness on main policy within
it now lies in the Red caves with which
it has been riddled in the last few
years by in-boring Communists.


THE TAIL THAT WAGS THE TWO-HEADED DOG


PLAIN ENGLISH
True to Form
The Geneva Conference of Foreign
Ministers is being carried on under great
difficulties by the representatives of the
Western Powers, not the least of them
being the normal behavior of their own
press.
Anything that will make a sensation
goes, and any information that will sell
papers also goes irrespective of whether
it harms the Western case or not.
The Russians have played their usual
game—agree to something and then im-
pose a new condition without which
they will not proceed. They opened by
demanding the admission on terms of
equality of East and West Germany,
which would have at once secured recog-
, nition of East Germany as a separate
free nation, which it is not, since it is
occupied by 23 Russian divisions, and
most of its supreme heads have lived
for years in Russia and are counted
Russian citizens.
Having agreed to allow East Germany
to appear as an observer along with
West Germany, the Western nations put
before the conference a plan for the
reunification of Germany under demo-
cratic methods and as an expression of
the free will of the peoples of both East
and West Germany.
The first stage in this was formation
of a united city of Berlin achieved
through free elections for the whole of
the city, East and West, the four occupy-
ing Powers being granted access to the
city until Germany should be united.
The next stage provides that a mixed
committee would be set-up, representa-
tion being on a population basis which
would mean 25 delegates from Western
Germany and 10 from the Eastern
sector who would work-out plans for
closer contacts between East and West
and for freedom of movement and
respect for human rights throughout the
whole community.
This committee would also draft an
electoral law for free and secret elec-
tions, by ballot, of the whole of the
German people, the poll to be carried
out under international supervision. All
decisions of the committee would need
to be taken by a three-quarters majority,
so that the East German minority on
it could not be outvoted on a territorial
basis.
Before the election was held the elec-
toral law would be submitted to
referendum of the whole of the German
people, and if the committee were un-
able to agree on a plan the minority
would have the right to submit its own
plan to the plebiscite at the same time.
The final elections would be for an
all-German Assembly to be held within
24 years of the signing of the agreement,
and would be supervised by Germans
from both Germanies, plus either dele-
gates of the United Nations or of the
Four Powers.
It would be left to the German
Assembly to draft an all-German Con-
stitution, and when this job was finished
an all-German Government would be
formed on the basis of its provisions.
In other words, German self-determina-
tion is provided for.
The last stage in the settlement would
be the conclusion of the peace with the
new United Germany, also in four
stages, through a joint declaration on
the peaceful settlement of disputes ; an
exchange of information about Nato
and Communist military forces and their
limitation within agreed numbers, with
measures for inspection and other pre-
cautions against surprise attack, and
inclusion of the renunciation made by
West Germany in 1954 of chemical,
biological and nuclear warfare. There
would be zones of limited forces, global
and otherwise.
All these plans would be harmonised
with a progressive one for general dis-
armament in the ultimate.
Finally would come the peace-treaty
with Germany as the apex of a general
move for peace.
It was obvious that Moscow intended
to sprag this plan. Every day it be-
comes clearer that Krushchev will do
his utmost even to the point of war to
prevent unification of Germany, or the
freeing of East Germany save under
the iron shoes of Russian tank-divisions.
To leave East Germans free to choose
their allegiance would mean that nearly
every German in the Russian zone
would join in a mad stampede towards
the West. So Krushchev has condemned
the scheme out of hand as “freezing
the issues.”
No Unity-tickets
After an angry debate, the biennial
Federal conference of the A.L.P. decided
by 20 votes to 16 —the prevailing vote
on every issue placed before the con-
ference about which there was any
difference of opinion— to warn A.L.P.
members that “on no occasion can they
allow their names to be associated with
members of any other political party on
any how-to-vote ticket.”
The conference was obviously afraid
to single-out the Communist party,
which its leaders have more than once
declared to be a treasonable conspiracy.
So it decided to insult good Australian
parties by making it an equal offence
for an Australian to have his member
of the party associate his name with
that of Mr. Menzies or Charles Ander-
son, V.C.
It is no wonder that there was resis-
tance, but unfortunately the resistance
was seemingly only to prevent A.L.P.
men from brigading their names with
Communists.
Since Mr. Chamberlain (lately an
enthusiastic visitor to Peking), is likely to
have the chief say in administering the
new ban, it can be taken that he will not
be oversevere with offenders, particularly
since Labor has come to such a pass that
the resolution was carried only by 20
votes to 16.
Old-fashioned Labor men would turn
in their graves at the thought of the
present condition of affairs.
However, the ban on unity-tickets is
meaningless and unimportant. Though
they cannot put their names on the same
ticket with proven Communist - party
candidates, A.L.P. aspirants for office
once elected may:
(1) Act in a common policy under
Communist leadership in any. union
executive;
(2) Employ a Communist advocate before
the Arbitration Court, as is done by the
Waterside Workers;
(3) Join with the Communists in forcing
members to subscribe to A.L.P. funds and
in wrecking them and destroying their right
tP earn a living if they will not knuckle-
under to this kind of savagery, which even
comes down to the level of intimidating
and insulting their womenfolk;
(4) Join in authorising the collection of
funds for election purposes within the union
and the division of the proceeds between
the A.L.P. and the Communist candidates;
(5) Represent the A.C.T.U. under pres-
sure from the dominating Communist
section at overseas conferences of inter-
national organisations which official Labor
everywhere has denounced as Communist,
as has recently been done by an A.L.P.
supporter;
(6) While away, be a guest of the Soviet
Union or any other Communist country,
denounce its own Australian Government
for its part in the Petrov affair, as also was
done recently, according to the Russian
press, by one such buckshee delegate.
There is no leader of Labor, includ-
ing Dr. Evatt, who does not know
that the ban on unity-tickets is merely
another Red-herring. It is about as
much practical use as shooting a bush-
ranger’s pet kitten and letting the bush-
ranger go and declaring a closed season
for him.
New Bread
Melburnians are happily relishing, or
ought to be, the internecine strife in
the bread-manufacturing industry which
has been for years a lucrative closed-
shop activity for the bakers and a soft
cop for employees, or most of them.
The most restrictive practices have
been enforced worst of all, a total
prohibition on week-end baking. The
Italians, chiefly, have been responsible
for breaking this down.
In addition to fancy breads that were
new to most Melburnians, the Italians
soon began supplying fresh bread at the
week-ends, often from one-man bakeries,
and, as the public began to accept this
service and competition toughened, the
larger concerns have found their trade
slipping.
The most recent notable prosecution
was of Austral Bakeries, of Kilsyth, one
of the biggest baking companies in
Melbourne, which was fined £5 on each
uf nine charges of having employed men
to work duriug prohibited hours.
A fine of £5 a time on a substantial


bakery is hardly crippling, or even a
very stern deterrent, and it has been
followed by outcries from the Bread
Manufacturers’ Association and the
Trades Hall that fines on week-end
bakers are “ridiculously low.”
They are hardly likely to impress
Melbourne magistrates who will not
agree that it is a terrible offence to
supply the citizens with fresh bread,
especially on Mondays, as they munch
their Friday’s-bread sandwiches in their
dreary little rooms behind the suburban
courts.
The Canberra Acrobats
As an exhibition of cynical opportunism
there has been nothing to match the
conference of the Federal A.L.P. at
Canberra in the history of Australian
politics.
To the delight of Sydney “Herald,”
gnawing fanatically at the bone which
it has to pick with Mr. Menzies, what-
ever it is, this vital biennial conference,
following on grave defeats of the party
at Federal and State elections and at
a crossroads in the world’s affairs,
plunged straightway into an examina-
tion of the dispute between Mr.
Chamberlain, its deserting president,
and the Federal caucus over the increase
in salaries. This was
presented by Mr. Chamberlain as an
earthshaking issue.
Both Mr. Chamberlain and Dr. Evatt
gave displays of bellowing oratory, and
members of the conference “closely
cross-examined” them as if they were
schoolboys who had been caught with
inky fingers or stealing apples. Mr.
Chamberlain, with the air of Sir Henry
Irving playing “Macbeth,” shouted that
unless the disgrace which had fallen on
the party were cleaned off its escutcheon
he would not stand again for the presi-
dency.
The conference obediently trembled as
if this disaster would be the Stone End.
He flayed the Parliamentary party, and
especially a wilting Mr. Calwell, who
was supposed to have made unseemly
remarks about old-age pensioners and
the unemployed sacred subjects, con-
cerned with the last theatrical props of
a seedy party for appealing to the
emotions of a large and powerful group
of voters.
Dr. Evatt, like his accuser, was allowed
“unlimited time” to contest the Cham-
berlain arguments, followed by unlimited
time for the delegates to cross-examine.
Overnight, however, the adversaries
got together and made a sordid bargain,
the one to accept a mild reproof in
return for favors on other manoeuvres
to come. It was typical of the state of
the party that the N.S.W. delegates,
representing a State executive which had
passed resolutions expressing “strong
disapproval” of the Federal caucus stand
on April 17, now proposed that there
should be no censure at all.
Indeed, the compromise to achieve a
mild and meaningless criticism was
achieved only by 20 votes to 16; so
that there was no weight behind the
playful flick which the conference
administered to its Parliamentary helots,
in which there was little to give pain,
even if the whole power of the A.L.P.
arm had been behind it.
It acknowledged that the Federal
Parliamentary party had acted within
the rules, though it “regretted that
Federal Labor members had not acted as
the general public, the A.L.P. branches
and affiliated unions expected them to
do, when so many incomes were
pegged”—ye gods!—“at hardship level!”
In the murky background, of course,
there were hidden and unworthy
motives, as there always seem to be
behind those of the curious conspira-
torial careerists who sit, hard-eyed and
cynical, to contrive the expedients which
add-up in these days to “Labor policy.”
For one thing it was obvious that
the whole of the conference had its
eye on some of the boodle which
M.P.s had voted to collect, and that if
the conference were too hard on the
culprits the immorality of a later move
to make a subsidiary and illegal levy
on Parliamentary beneficiaries to finance
a central A.L.P. junta in Canberra
would be too apparent to allow it to be
implemented.
The plan for the Canberra A.L.P.
central office is an expensive one, esti-
mated to cost £30,000 a year, but it
seems to be conceived as an Australian
politbureau which would run the
country when Labor should get into
power in the same way that the Polit-
bureau of the U.S.S.R. overrides the
Kremlin.
Out-patient Alcoholics
Alcoholism has reached such propor-
tions in Australia- that the Victorian
Mental Hygiene Authority is opening
a clinic in Fitzroy, an inner Melbourne
suburb, for the treatment of alcoholics
as out-patients.
It is an experiment by Dr. Cunning-
ham Dax, the chairman of the authority,
modelled on a clinic he saw operating
in Washington, U.S.A. It will open in
two or three months.
Dr. Dax tells The Bulletin that the
clinic will deal with out-patients sent
to it by their doctors, with others who
have been at the alcoholic section of
the mental home, Royal Park, or at
Pentridge prison. They will be given
treatment, put in touch with the liaison-
officers of Alcoholics Anonymous and
psychiatric groups, as well as the Salva-
tion Army and religious officers. There
will also be advice for non-alcoholics
in dealing with them.
As far as is known, this will be the
first out-patients clinic ever begun in
Australia, although treatment is given
in the general hospital in Brisbane and
at Ryde mental home in N.S.W. There
are no out-patient clinics for alcoholics
in England because alcoholism is not
nearly as widespread, and its incidence
is much less in the U.K.
The reason for its high incidence in
Australia has eluded researchers ; per-
haps it is due to the six-o’clock closing
of hotels which existed, and still exists
in some States, for so long, encouraging
the swilling rather than the drinking
of alcohol.
The authority has recently opened a
psychiatric department for alcoholics at
Pentridge jail, with two experienced
doctors, and a third has been engaged
in England. About half the Pentridge
population have been jailed because of
acts due to their alcoholism.
In addition, Royal Park receives in-
patients at the rate of 1000 a year.
Unless they join Alcoholics Anonymous,
the in-patients are discharged to take-up
their normal lives without assistance
against what is now recognised as a
widespread disease. The clinic will help
support their own endeavors.
U.S.S.R. Census
One of the most astonishing public
documents issued for many years is
the Russian census, which has just been
released.
Including the populations of the parts
of Finland and Poland and the Baltic
States grabbed at the beginning of the
war, the population of Russia in 1940 was
estimated to be over 190 million. Without
the annexations of 1940 it would have
been 170 million.
Since then there have been no reliable
figures, and the census shows the total
to be only 208 million, or about 35 million
more than the United States in January
of this year. The population, in fact, has
increased only 15 million or 18 million
since 1940.
The war seems to have been responsible
for upwards of 30-million loss of popula-
tion, including the deaths of those wiped-
out by the Russians themselves in the
Baltic States, and taking into account the
lost births.
The military casualties alone, of course,
were about eight million. The census
shows that there are 20-million more
women than men in the U.S.S.R., but the
hiatus is among those who were over 18 in
1946, and males and females less than 32
years old are about equal in numbers.
It is shown that Moscow has a popula-
tion of only five-million, that Leningrad’s
population is only 2,888,000, or about
half-a-million fewer than immediately
before the war.
One other fact gives'the reason why so
much stress is laid on automation and
mechanisation in the new seven-year
plan, and why that plan was redrawn
after the withdrawal of the last five-year
plan. Also, why labor has been transferred
from long-term hydroelectric projects to
immediate production of energy from
coal.
In spite of all the bluff and noisd, it
appears that notwithstanding its 208-million
inhabitants, of whom 114-million are
women, Russia is short of industrial man-
power even at its present low standard-
of-living, and is compelled to rely on the
machines and longer and faster work by
the existing labor force to carry out its
objectives.

■*- handed patrons a roneoed circular
listing the proposed programme
for the coming month, and adding that
unless the month’s rent, £250, could be
found within three days the theatre would
close immediately. The circular appealed
to film-lovers to pay £1 for a month’s
subscription, two programmes a week,
and stave-off the bailiff. There was also
a hint that if things could be kept going
for a couple of months a scheme was in
hand which would keep the doors open
indefinitely. Judging by the line-up when
I went to hand over my quid it seems
likely that the theatre will be in business
for a while yet, TV or no TV. —“W.M.”

his grubby hands, moved to the bed-

he countenanced that “in”—did he not,
in the same book, prattle about a

DISORDERLY HOUSING
“Addressing the ninth Australian Architec-

You said it, boss ; the Australian housing

“A strange confusion of desires and

The kids want rumpus-rooms as full of

And just as canned, as Yankee fun-

Mothers have tendencies to the baroque —■
Beethoven, sweeping curtains, the haut
monde —
Fathers, to suites or towers, where a bloke
Might entertain, in secret, some shy
blonde :
Three bedrooms and one living-room, for
most,
All these at once, or all in turn, intern ;
Thus tact replaces what design has lost
In architecture’s modest art-moderne
That, like its abstract paintings on the
wall,
Never looks like anything at all.

one in the family decided to christen him

and “Billy Graham” he became. The
funny thing is our ginger cat doesn't
seem to mind the intruder ; he hasn’t, so
to speak, made a decision one way or the

Mallee district named Claypans. Today
the place has still only four telephone-

always figured prominently in the country
news-column of the daily, with concise
and accurate reports of weather, crops,

6in. buckwheat-cake disks on his plate,
sandwiched butter between each ply,
quartered the pile with two knife-cuts,

To Be Where?
Vienna Youth Conference
"Maski" Interviews a Few
Well in advance, the
7th World Youth and
Student Festival —
planned for Vienna
between July 26 and August 4
—has already generated more
heat and controversy among
students than any of its pre-
decessors.
Austrian youth-movements
have given frank warnings
that hair may be flying be-
tween those dates unless its
organisers take the Festival out
of Austria and place it back
behind the Iron Curtain.
At this stage the Festival
looks like being a memorable
gathering—for the West.
At most, some experts have
told me, the pointers could
even indicate a new trend in
student-thinking—a flat rejec-
tion of Communist propaganda
by the majority of the world’s
student-bodies, some of which
have certainly not rejected Red
ideas before.
Organisers in Australia are
at present choosing the 30
delegates they will send to join
the 17,000 “youths” . (age-
limit, 30 years) who will gather
for the Festival. These Aus-
tralian organisers do not admit
they are worried by the Fes-
tival’s score-card to date, but
some are perturbed at what
could happen in Vienna.
Apart from one bright spot
—the Austrian Govern-
ment’s approval for it to be
held —the Festival has so far
landed in these bunkers:'
February : The International
Student Conference, meeting in
Lima, condemned the Festival.
The 68 national student-unions
represented voted 2 to 1
against the conference associat-
ing itself with the Festival.
March 5 : General strikes of
students at Vienna University.
They had the full support of
their professors. Their view
was that the Festival should
not be held in their city.
March 7 : About 20,000 Aus-
trian youths, members of non-
Communist youth- and student-
organisations, marched through
Vienna. They called their
procession a “silent march.”
As they marched, they distri-
buted pamphlets which stated
their view that the Festival was
an instrument of Red propa-
ganda.
March 19: The National
Union of Australian Univer-
sity Students, a body which
has had observers at previous
Festivals (but not since 1954),
went on record in “Honi Soit”
against the Vienna Festival.
The president of N.U.A.U.S.,
M. G. Davey, wrote: “In the
face of such general condemna-
tion by the largest represen-
tative student-gathering in the
world (the Lima conference)
it has surprised Austrian youth-
organisations to find- the
Festival given [Austrian]
Government approval, especi-
ally as its nature as a Com-
munist instrument has never
been in doubt. N.U.A.U.S.
hopes that its expressed dis-
approval, added to that of
other national unions. and
youth-organisations, including
the World Assembly of Youth,
will help the Austrian ‘Arbeit-
gemeinschaft Junges Leben’ to
obtain the withdrawal of this
approval from the Festival and
of the Festival from Vienna.”
If the Festival site is changed,
it will almost certainly go
back behind the Iron Curtain,
probably to Prague.
T}or data on the Festival, and
for some assessment of
what its history to date might
mean, I interviewed some
people who frankly are not
fond of the Reds and some
who frankly are fond of the
Festival.
The first was Mr. Laurie
Short, secretary of the Feder-
ated Ironworkers’ Association.
Mr. Short was in Vienna in
October, 1956, when Austria
was celebrating the first anni-
versary of its freedom from
Russia’s control.
“The Communists are trying
to hold these Festivals outside
the Iron Curtain if they can,
so that it will look better,” he
said. “That’s why they chose
Vienna.”
He said a Government like
Austria’s could well be
influenced by student-opinion
—influenced enough to ban the
Festival.
“That Government kicked
out of Vienna the World
Federation of Trade Unions —
a Communist show,” he said.
“Remember, too, that the
Austrian Government was very
hospitable to the Hungarian
refugees.”
He felt the actions of
students at the Lima confer-
ence, and the “silent march,”
showed a growing awareness
among the world’s student-
bodies about “Communist-
front” organisations. He felt
that the attitude of N.U.A.U.S.
showed a growing sense in
Australia that they were only
“fronfi’-organisations, and a
growing unwillingness to fall
for them and become part of
them.
“I find that, politically, Were poles apart!”
The A.L.P. Youth Move-
ment had voted strongly against
the Vienna festival, said Mr.
Short.
A lso interviewed, Mr. Paul
Johnson, a Eureka Youth
League organiser, disagreed
with Mr. Short.
The “silent march” and later
activities of students would
have no effect on the Austrian
Government’s decision to hold
the Festival, said Mr. Johnson.
“The Austrian Government
has made its stand clear,” he
said. “Austria favors neutral-
ity, and the idea of East and
West coming together.”
The Austrian Chancellor,
Dr. Raab, had made a personal
appeal to the Catholic youth-
organisations in Austria to
change their attitude about the
Festival, said Mr. Johnson.
He said such Festivals brought
together the youth of different
countries, so the young people
could mix and grow to know
one another and discuss their
common interests. Festivals
broke-down barriers between
countries, he said.
Mr. Johnson then gave some
data on the Festival. Australia
would send 30 delegates at a
cost of £390 a head. They
would include members of
youth-organisations, the Labor
party, and sportsmen, and they
would go as “representatives
of Australia”—not as mere
“tourists.” The delegation
would leave about mid-June.
It would fly to Hong Kong
and would spend about one
month in China.
Mr. Johnson said the dele-
gates would have two jobs —
to represent Australia at the
Festival and to form a “fact-
finding” mission in China.
An expert on Catholic
Church adult education
and social affairs, Dr. Ryan,
backed-up Mr. Laurie Short’s
comments. Dr. Ryan said he
felt these two factors had
brought about the decisions of
student groups against the
Festival:
9 Members had not been
aware in the past of the real
function of the Festivals.
& Delegates and observers
at previous Festivals had re-
turned and made them aware.
(Continued on page 49)


POLITICAL POINTS
So far the only thing the Foreign
Ministers seem to have agreed on is that
their opinions differ.
• a
The hibernating season for M.P.s is
now well under way. The Senate and the
Reps, adjourned on Thursday and will
not meet again till August, when
Treasurer Holt will present his first
Budget. Cahill’s Parliament is also in
recess until August—it met one day in
April for the swearing-in of members and
was also called together yesterday
(Tuesday) for the purpose of electing a
new member for the Legislative Council.
When Joe brings in his next bill to
increase members’ salaries he’ll find it
hard to convince even the members them-
selves that they’ve earned it.
• •
Attorney - General Barwick’s intro-
duction of the Uniform Divorce Bill
brought from Dr. Evatt the comment that
he had presented it not only carefully, but
in many respects brilliantly. The legisla-
tion is long overdue, and some State
Governments which have been reluctant
to tackle what has always been a thorny
problem will probably be privately glad
the job has been taken out of their hands.
The bill reduces to 14 the 30 assorted
grounds of the various State acts, and the
general tone is one of commonsense. As
far as N.S.Wales is concerned the grounds
have been widened, but one “favorite”
device—failure to comply with a restitu-
tion-order—has been made less attractive
to employ. The new grounds are appar-
ently-incurable insanity for a period of
five years; separation for at least five
years with no likelihood of reconcilia-
tion ; refusal to consummate the
marriage ; and there are minor changes
in other grounds.
The qualifying period under the restitu-
tion clauses will be one year instead of
21 days in N.S.Wales; the change is
already being criticised, but at present too
many “restitution” divorces have the
appearance of being divorces by consent.
The Divorce Bill will be debated during
the Budget session in August; the Gov-
ernment has declared it a non-party
measure and members will vote according
to personal opinions.

By 20 votes to 16 the A.L.P. conference
condemned unity-tickets. This means that
the official attitude of the party is the
same as it has been for years, and that
probably means that unity-tickets will
continue as they have for years.
N. S. Wales Premier Cahill has asked
Acting P.M. McEwen to name the date
for the annual Premiers’ Conference and
Loan Council meeting. Last year the
conference opened on June 4 and
in 1957 on May 24. Cahill in-
tends to seek a bigger allocation for 1959-
60 and is basing his hopes on the
improved loan-market -and buoyant
Commonwealth revenue. Other States will
probably take the same view. The Com-
monwealth Government, however, after
supplementing loan-funds from revenue
for several years, may feel inclined to
take advantage of its improved financial
position to grant some of the tax-cuts it
has refused in other years.

The “Hera!d”-“Sun” group of news-
papers in Sydney has again gone off at
half-cock ; this time about the proposed
Federal divorce legislation. Divorce will
be more costly; no more “quick” divorce;
and no more divorces in country courts.
That's the “Herald”-“Sun” matrimonial
wail. It appears, in fact, that the number
of Supreme Court judges will need to be
increased from three to six in N.S.W. and
the number of registrars reduced from
three to one ; but, from the point of
view of the matrimonial litigant, delays
should be reduced, and costs as well. As
regards country divorce, what’s to stop
judges in divorce going on circuit, the
same as other judges? Custody of
children and reconciliation may be
matters that will take up greater judicial
time than hitherto ; but the younger
generation of barristers who are prepared
to study the new legislation are all for it.
It is a century or more ahead of previous
legislation in N.S.W. and Victoria, but it’s
up to State Governments to see that there
are enough judges and courts to admin-
ister it.

CONTEMPORARY THINKING


Representations are being made to the
Immigration authorities to allow five
Spanish seamen who deserted in Brisbane
from a Dutch ship to remain in Australia;
legally they are due for deportation as
prohibited immigrants. If the Minister
wWt yield all the way he should at least
make an exception in one case, that of
Pedro Alzono Diaz de Monasterioguren.
We can’t afford to lose a man with a
name like that.

Woomera scientists scored a bull’s-eye
recently when they photographed U.S.

Sir Arthur Warner, Victorian Minister
for Railways, has found the going for a
shipwrecked mariner even stormier than
politics since he ran his yacht, the £lO,OOO
Winston Churchill, aground in a sinking
condition during a storm near Wonthaggi
on April 6.
She had to be stripped .and dragged
ashore ; hoisted on to a giant low-loader
and taken to the Wiiliamstown shipyards,
more than 90 miles, with the assistance of
the Country Roads Board, the police, the
Electricity Commission, and the Railways,
not to mention the contractors.
Then six non-union workers began
repairing the yacht, and 100 others
employed by the Harbor Trust felt so
strongly about it, or so their union bosses
claimed, they staged a-stopwork meeting.

It is reported that if trials of the British-
invented saucer-shaped “hovercraft,”
which is supported on a cushion of air
and-skims across the sea, are successful,
the first vessel using the principle may be
a cross-Channel passenger- and vehicle-
ferry. Perhaps the Sydney traffic authori-
ties might inquire into the possibilities of
such a craft for Harbor crossings.

Frank Dowling, secretary of the
D.L.P. in Victoria, where unity-tickets
are a thornier issue than in other States,
summed-up the issue succinctly:
Unions which countenance unity-tickets
should admit openly they are trying to
establish the type of Labor party that
publicly condemns Communists but
privately helps Communists. The real issue
was whether a Labor-party member who
stood with Communists was to be allowed
to retain A.L.P. membership. Unionists
could stand on their own ticket or' a
Communist ticket if they wanted to.
After all these years, the Doc. thinks
like the D.L.P. Suddenly it suits him.
A discouraging sidelight on Australia’s
diplomatic service was revealed by
External Affairs Minister Casey in reply
to a question about the linguistic ability
of Australian representatives in Asia.
Only 18 of the 176 members of our
diplomatic staff, said the Minister, could
speak, read and write an Asian language
fluently. Six of these were proficient in
Japanese, six in Chinese, three in Malay,
two in Indonesian and one in Bengali and
Urdu. Casey said the aim of his depart-
ment was to have on every Asian post at
least one man whe spoke the principal
local language, but that at present this
was not the case.
It’s to be hoped the department is
doing something to remedy this
deficiency ; it has frequently been, com-
mented that Russian officials in South-
east Asia are invariably fluent in the
local tongue. The disadvantage of
having always to depend on interpreters
is obvious.
Incidentally, although Japanese can
now be taken as a Leaving Certificate
subject in N.S.W., only one secondary
school in Sydney has a class in that
language.

“Stromlo”: Our adventurous and
highly efficient Antarctic expeditions
continue to arrive and depart, bringing
stories of hazard and discovery and
taking staffs and stores on journeys
which remain difficult and dangerous
despite modern inventions. But they
come and go still in chartered ships,
surely the worst kind of advertisement
for our claim to sovereignly over about
one-third of the Antarctic area. It
would be interesting to learn just how
much has been paid out in charter-fees
for the job the Magga Dan and Thala
Dan have done so well —and whether
we could not have built and manned
our own vessels for the same amount,
or something close to it.

The Playford State, poor in natural
resources compared with its eastern
neighbors, always seems to be coming-up
with something new to compensate for
its disabilities. Latest project is a plan
to generate power from the sea by pump-
ing salt-water up to a high-level storage-
dam and releasing it to drive turbines.
Feasibility of the scheme would depend
on using existing power-plants to do the
pumping during off-peak periods and
augmenting their capacity by feeding-in
the sea-powered electricity at times of full
load. This would enable the conventional
power-stations to work to full capacity
round the clock,, with consequent reduc-
tion in costs. British engineering consul-
tants have been invited to report on the
possibilities.

“Ex-ACT": There is strong authority

The A.L.P. biennial conference took
time off from discussing the Red-hot
unity-ticket question to reject a proposal
that the term “White Australia policy”
should be replaced by the euphemism
“selective-immigration policy.” And very
rightly rejected. The “White Australia
policy” is traditional, it is pithy, and its
terminology is offensive only to whites
who have a superiority complex, or to
blacks with an inferiority ditto—and they
would be very rare. In any case, the
average Asian or African has never heard
of the White Australia policy. Most
Asians who have, have heard it from
busybodying Australian journalists, do-
gooders or plain trouble-makers bent on
getting their writing or their names into

According to Alan Moodie, a Dalgety’s
auctioneer, good young breeding-cattle
are being sent to auction and the chopp-
ing-block because graziers are dazzled by
the prices being paid to meet the U.S.
demand ; at £lOO each bulls are bringing
more than the price of prime-quality beef

ians differ on whether the cattle-breeding
industry is being endangered, but there is
close to unanimity that sales to the U.S.
are increasing.

On May 22 Hal Gye will pass his
71st milestone. As a very young lad
he had his first verse published in The
Bulletin’s “Poverty Point” page. Madam
Melba had just bought a motorcar and
he got so tired of its being publicised
that he wrote: “Madam Melba’s
Motorcar.” His first cartoon for The
Bulletin was of George Reid, based on
Norman Lindsay’s picture: “The
Woman I Was.” Then he went
bohemian, making friends with Sass,
the Dysons, Randolph Bedford, “Kodak,”
Hugh McCrae and other artists and
writers. He shared a studio with David
Low for seven years and worked with
C. J. Dennis, illustrating The Sentimental
Bloke, The Glugs of Gosh, and other

writer of verse and short-stories, he
ranks among the most versatile of

Melbourne is losing that famous chef
Walter Zimmerman ; he is 65, and must
retire from the Education Department,
which runs the William Angliss Food
Trades School, where he has trained more
than 600 men and women cooks.
In recent decades he has become one
of the personalities of Melbourne, and
not merely because of his memorable
dishes or notable meals: he has been a
cultured, witty and agreeable citizen.
No comparable job is apparently open
to him in Australia, and he will join the
Norddeutscher Lloyd line on the
v Hamburg-Bremen-New York run.
Before he arrived in Melbourne he
studied or cooked at Prunier’s, the
Grosvenor and the Waldorf; he was
assistant-chef in 1924 at Buckingham
Palace for King George V, and at
Balmoral for the Duke of Windsor and
King George VI. He was also chef at
Yarralumla.

birthday with her Majesty (and it’s also
artist Ted Scorfield’s), Richard Thomas
Tarrant grew-up around Maitland and
Newcastle and spent his early years in
agriculture on the Warner estate near
Wyong. Commissioned in May, 1914, he
was appointed on the outbreak of War 1
to the 2nd Battalion, A.1.F., landed at
Anzac on April 27, 1915, and was


wounded the same day. He rejoined in
France, where he served with the 45th
Battalion, was again wounded and then
posted to the 12th Training Battalion in
England. In June, 1918, he was selected
for a military mission to North Russia
and served there until invalided back to
Australia.
For a time secretary of the N.S.W.
Lawn Tennis Ground, Ltd., he afterwards
became a director of various com-
panies. When War II broke out, Tarrant
was first a brigade-major, then was posted

The Royal Newcastle, established in
1817, is the second-oldest hospital in
Australia, and many who have never
been anywhere near - it know of its
efficient administration and service to the
public This reputation is largely due
to the medical superintendent, Dr. James
McCaffrey, who has been there for 20
years. His guiding principle is that a
hospital is a business, with its object
adequate care of the sick, and that it
should be run as such.
Dr. McCaffrey (pictured) was born at
Albury (N.S.W.) and graduated at Sydney
University. He has lived in Newcastle all
his medical life, was first a resident
radiologist at the Royal Newcastle, then
took-up feis present position. He con-
siders that in this age of specialisation
there must be proper training for
specialists. In consequence the teaching
and staffing are run on methods which
are a compromise between American and
best Australian practice.

ABORIGINALITIES
Two buyers at our neighbor’s clearing-
A sale must each have reckoned he
got a bargain. One lot, a milking-cow,
was housed in a shed, and bidding began
in there, but the auctioneer soon called
a halt. “We’re too crowded in here,” he
said. “I can’t see who’s bidding and who
isn’t. If you’ve all had a look at her,
we’ll go outside and start again.” The
move having been made, the auctioneer
took his stand in the shade of a tree
where a likely-looking kelpie was chained,
and bidding ran-up briskly to £3B 15s.
The clerk, having taken the last bidder’s
name, asked, “And what do you want
done with the cow, Mr. A?” “Cow?
What cow? I was bidding for that dog
there. I’ve seen him work and he’s worth
every penny of the money.” “Well, I
wasn’t bidding for any dog,” said 8.,
the second-last bidder. “I was after that
cow.” So the cow was put-up again,
and 8., who had previously bid £3B 10s.,
got her for £27 ss. Then the dog was
auctioned, and A., who reckoned he was
worth £3B 155., bought him for £l2.

“G.G.2.”: Knew of two other bushie-
disguised mounted cops who, like the
one mentioned by “Margaret”
(B. 15/4/’59), failed to get their men be-
cause of deficiencies of detail. One sent
from Boulia (W.Q.). to get a wanted man
on Warenda was suitably ragged and
complete with three-days growth on his
chin. Horses and gear were standard
traveller-style, except for one oversight—
his saddlecloth carried the monogram QP
in red letters. In the other case a Territory
policeman on the Barkly forgot to un-
polish the bit and buckles of his bridle.
In both instances identity was sure and
immediate, and the bush-grapevine did
the rest.

“Warien”: A salmagundi (“Talbingo,”
B. 29/4/’59) is a dish of chopped meat,
anchovies, eggs, onions, etc., with oil,
vinegar and pepper. In other words, any
mixture of various ingredients; a medley
or potpourri. I like the definition of pot-
pourri as a “confused mixture”; perhaps
that would be the most accurate descrip-
tion of a salmagundi.

“Duke” Tritton: “Fair Mac” (B.
8/4/’59) picked it in one. My nickname
was given to me when I was 15 years
of age. I had entered a tournament for
boys of 16 at Redfern, Sydney, it was
my first public appearance as a boxqr,
and I was vdry nervous. My opponent
was George King, known as Kingie ;
he was a local lad, and his friends had
rolled-up in force. I had only my three
mates. “Kingie” put it all over me in
the first round, and his friends kept up
a chant of “Go on, Kingie!” It made
me feel as though 1 didn’t nave a friend
in the world. But as I sat sadly in my
corner, wishing I had never seen a box-
ing-glove and wondering what had made
TOM TAYLOR’S STORY
In a loud monotonous voice and slow,
With never a pause for breath,
Tom Taylor turned and said to me,
“I’ll tell you now the story of how
poor Parson met his death—
we were fishing two mates, the vicar and
me,
by the side of Currango ;
the river’s in flood and so, you s ee,
we were fishing together the vicar and me
with worms for the fish below —
he stepped I think in a wombat-hole
and fell smack into the spate
and as he fell he yelled at me
I’ve had it, don’t help me mate;
I’ve had it; he said; and you can’t swim
so there’s nothing you can do.
Now here’s the horrible part and grim,
the worst I’ll ever see,
as he spun and turned in the current, by
God ,
he stood as straight as a tree ;
he turned and spun still standing straight,
like a soldier of Christ was he.
We lassooed him out, my mates and I,
but he’s dead when we got him to
ground —
I wouldn’t have had it happen you
know,
not for a million pound.”

me think I could fight, a great booming
voice came from the back of the hall:
“Go on, the Duke.” There was a
moment’s startled silence, a laugh, and
then other voices took-up the chant. As
the bell went I think there were as many
yelling for “Duke” as for “Kingie.” It
revived my courage, and for the remain-
ing five rounds I never let-up. But neither

did Kingie, and he got the decision on
a narrow margin. However, I was happy.
On the way to the dressing-room I
received many handshakes, pats on the
back, and “Good boy, Duke! You put
up a good fight!” was music to me. I’m
still “Duke.”

“Spin”: In W.A. it’s illegal to carry
animal manure from farms without a

12-15 (Queen’s Birthday holiday week-
end), Ampol has weighed-in with two
20 gns prizes, for (1) a “picture composi-

a “sculpture” in any medium (subject as
above). Details of competitions and of the

“Amdee”: The slump in trochus-shell
prices and the resulting absence of T.I.
luggers and their crews from N.Q. waters
between Cairns and Townsville, has
allowed the dugong-herds to increase
(again after the slaughter of the last few
years. That such an almost-defenceless
creature can survive attacks of ,its
numerous natural enemies is amazing,
for it is, owing to its barrel-shaped body,
a comparatively slow swimmer. Its lack
of defensive teeth is another handicap.
Its rotundity, perhaps, is one of the
reasons for its survival, for it makes
attacking by sharks and crocs, difficult;
whilst its grey color lends it a certain
camouflage. Its only weapon of defence
is its huge sinewy tail, a blow from which
could k.o. most attackers.

“Jeyles”: Camelhair brushes derive
from squirrels, kid-gloves arc sheepskin,
and English doeskin gloves come from
Cape sheep. Queen Victoria wore

“Bass”: Yarn I liked best at this
year’s reunion was Ted’s account of how
he was oiling his locomotive at a Belgian
station in War I —he was a loco-driver—
when he was approached by a Tommy
with a worried look and a question:
“Hast seen masc’t?” “What y’ lookin’
f’?” Ted asked. “Goat,” said chum.
Ted hadn’t seen it and went
on oiling while the entire Tommy
company searched. Finally one of them
called out, “Here ’tis. I found un”; then,
in a voice vibrant with rage, “T bluddy
Aussies etten t’ poor b !” *The
finder was holding up a goatskin with
four hooves still attached.

“Myall”: The first internal-
combustion tractor to be used in Queens-
land is housed in the grounds of the
Memorial Hall at Jimbour, on the
Darling Downs. Manufactured in
England by Clayton and Shuttleworth,
it is powered by a 3-cylinder kerosene-
burning engine, and was imported by
W. Ewing for ploughing on his farm.
On the sale of his property in 1914,
Ewing stipulated that the tractor was to
remain his property, that it should be kept
under shelter, and protected from pilfer-
ing and vandalism. After 47 years the
old machine is still complete and in good
running-order.

“Wommadoo”: Another pub-name of
some originality (B. 1/4/’59) is the new
Wallaroo at Coolatai, north of Warialda
(N.S.W.). The township had been publess
since the old hostelry was burnt down
18 years ago, and so great was the re-
joicing at the opening of the Wallaroo
that thirsty customers burst into song—
a ditty named “The Return of the
Coolatai Pub,” specially written, recorded
and broadcast for the occasion by a
Coolatai resident.

“Ybsul”: A few years back I was
always intrigued, passing over Brisbane’s
Victoria Biidge, by the sight' of a row of
herons keeping watch on the river from
the top of a large sign dominating the

“Baksac”: One of those old-time
coachmaking and wheelwright firms had
premises in King Street, Newtown, almost
opposite the road that led down to
Sydney’s Prince Alfred Hospital. The
feature about the big workshop that
stuck in my eight-year-old mind was the
novelty of the windows —they were
either made from cartwheels or made to
look like them, the glass fitted in the
space between spokes, hub and felloe.

A lysaght ad. in The Bulletin never
fails to stir a memory. In the early-
settlement days in N.Q. new arrivals
invariably ordered, as a preliminary to
house-building, half-a-ton of corrugated
galvanised-iron to be brought out by
packhorse. By the time it arrived the
square timbers, slab-walls, or black-
palm walls all pit-sawn would be
ready for the roof. And, since the one
we occupied at the mine had no ceiling,
that was how I learned to read —lying
on my back and spelling-out the letters
on the silver sheets that withstood the
thundering rains of the wet - season.
Lysaght’s flat-iron was also in heavy
demand for building pipelines to bring
water onto the sluicing-claims.—“C.F.”


Meeting the Mokolkols
By D. M. FIENBERG
IN a report to the JJnited Nations the Administration of the Trust Territory of New Guinea
included the following: note:—
“The Mokolkol people were visited by Mr. D. M. Fienberg, Assistant District Officer, and
Mr. C. Normoyle, Cadet Patrol Officer. . . . For more than a quarter of a century the Mokolkols
have been known to the Administration as a small band of primitive nomads, apparently of
Gainings origin, living in the country at the foot of the Gazelle Peninsula. Administratively
they have enjoyed a notoriety disproportionate to their slight numerical importance, through
their long-standing habit of raiding outlying hamlets, wantonly butchering men, women and
children, and disappearing without trace. Before the war several patrols endeavored to get into
friendly contact with these people, but they were always met with hostility.”
The patrol-party is now heading into the wild Mokolkol country.
(Continued)
Next morning we paddled
in canoes across to
Open Bay, near the
mouth of the Mavulu
River, and headed inland.
After the heavy rain-forest
of the coastal flats we climbed
the first ridges, the undergrowth
thinned-out, and the patrol, 54
in all, wound silently through
the dense timber at the steady
two-miles-per-hour which, con-
trary to popular fiction, is a
fairly normal rate in virgin
New Guinea bush.
It was damnably hot, and at
every 10-minute halt the little
black sweat-bees, as usual,
singled me out for particular
attention. ''Profuse sweating is
one of my few accomplish-
ments.
Early in the afternoon we
saw a network of faint tracks
made by humans, and finally
came to a recently used
hunting-camp, consisting of
five crude conical shelters
strung along a ridge. There
were saplings for 15 beds, and
four large racks for smoking
pig-carcasses.
A few discarded axe-handles,
of typically elongated design,
identified the camp as Mokol-
kol. They had been there
about a fortnight earlier.
After scouting the area, we
moved on, observing occasional
signs of recent activity, but no
regular tracks. A thunder-
storm soaked us, but surface-
water was scarce, and we finally
camped near a small stagnant
pool in a tiny claypan,
obviously favored as a wallow
by the wild-pigs. To the disgust
of the carriers, a pair of casso-
wary, as if realising their tem-
porary immunity from rifle-
fire, stared at us insolently
from a thicket before lumber-
ing off into the dripping
gloom.
We carried only three light
tent-flies, but to those familiar
with it the rain-forest is fairly
kind to*campers. Poles, lash-
ings, thatching-material and
firewood are all usually handy.
To get dry kindling, one
simply hacks away at a dead
softwood trunk until a dry
layer is reached. The tool-of-
all-work is the 18in. bush-knife,
carried by every porter.
Within an hour of halting
every man was under cover
and insulated from the wet
ground, firewood had been col-
lected, shallow latrines dug,
and the cooks were busy over
the rice-saucepans.
Chris was in charge of
rations, and Bill Heather doc-
tored cuts, scratches, and dis-
pensed quinine and aspirin to
the ailing. Corporal Kindili
checked his night-guard roster
with me.
The water from the claypan
was strongly flavored, but we
found enough of a water-
bearing tree-vine to fill the
coffee-pot and dilute the rum.
We breakfasted at daylight,
and extinguished the fires
before the morning mists dis-
persed.
The patrol resumed its wind-
ing march through the trees a
little after 7 a.m., to the accom-
paniment of mocking farewells
from a raucous hornbill.
Tolat, my old cook, put every-
one in a good humor when he
dramatically accused the bird
of being a Mokolkol spy, mean-
time fingering the shotgun
suggestively. The hornbill’s
flesh is tough and gamey, but
makes wonderful soup.
'T'he next three days were
■*- much the same, only
wetter and rougher. It was
slow going. Whilst maintain-
ing a general compass-bearing
towards the marked map-loca-
tion of the village, we had to
scout every likely sign.
We found a small garden-
clearing, long out of cultiva-
tion, and a clump of canarium
almonds whose upper branches
had been lopped (to obtain
the nuts) only a few weeks
before.
Deep axe-cuts on trees were
frequent: a Mokolkol habit
that greatly interested the
carriers, some of whom began
to fashion crude spears.
Meantime we had climbed
to nearly 3000 ft., and lime-
stone formations became
increasingly evident on the
ridges. The intervening gullies
absorbed the heavy afternoon
rains like sponges, and our
evening search for water
became an increasingly serious
business.
On the fifth day we left
young Chris in charge of the
camp, and Bill and I, with a
scouting-party of police and
kaulons, explored the higher
country to our south and south-
east. This area, according to
the aerial observations, should
contain the village.
Before long, an uneasy sus-
picion which Bill and I had
been harboring during the pre-
vious 24 hours crystallised into
glum certainty: the aerial map-
spotters, themselves plagued by
the inaccurate war-time pro-
visional aerial maps, had
plotted the village’s position too
high up, and between the
wrong gorges. The area into
which we had climbed rose
steeply to the head of the cen-
tral range, in a succession of
limestone ridges. It was poor
country, meagrely clad with
moss forest; no natives would
ever live voluntarily in such
terrain. There were no longer
any old signs of human
activity ; even the wild-pigs
avoided this unpromising slice
of wilderness.
We struggled up a pinnacle
to get sights on the coast.
Neither bird nor insect chirped,
and the eerie screaming of a
distant white-cockatoo height-
ened a lonely feeling that we
were probably- the first humans
ever to invade that desolate
neck of the woods. The
clouds began to sit on us
damply, in sullen triumph, and
the shivering kaulons, fearful
of masalais, gazed about appre-
hensively.
WE circled to the north-west,
silently cursing the cold
drizzle, the inaccurate map,
McCarthy’s plane-spotting, and
the eroded limestone pinnacles
that ripped our hands.
After another ’’Three hours’
rough going, including two
ravine crossings and a scarey
climb down a cliff-face, we
struck what appeared to be
the main Mavulu gorge, here
a sheer-walled canyon. Its
floor showed little patches of

IMPORTS IN OUR LIFE
'T'hough John McEwen,
Minister for Trade, re
marked in Canberra the other
day that Australia was no
longer riding wholly on the
sheep's back, the White Paper
on “The Australian Economy,
1959,’’ tabled in the Federal
House on May 14 by the same
Minister, tacitly underlines the
value of wool, and the import-
ance of wool prices, in pro-
viding overseas funds with
which to pay for imports.
After acknowledging that
favorable factors helped Aus-
tralia out during the recession
and setbacks of the
past 18 months, and that the
industrial and financial com-
munity played a notable part
in encountering the less favor-
able influences, the White
Paper emphasises the import-
ance of essential imports in
our future development and
the necessity for finding ways
of paying for them.
“The achievement of these
two years,” says the survey,
“might be described as a
successful holding operation.
Perhaps it has been rather
better than that; within
the economy a good deal
of headway has undoubtedly
been made. But does that hold
of our external position? Have
we gained any ground in the
difficult task of providing for
our growing overseas require-
ments?
“It has been apparent for
some time that the success or
failure of our plans for enlarg-
ing the Australian economy
may well turn on whether we
succeed or fail in getting access
to larger i resources from
abroad —access, that is, to the
larger imported supplies our
economy will inevitably need.
Failure in this regard could,
plainly enough, be the rock
on which our aspirations
founder because there is-noth-
ing more certain than that,
whatever we may do to enlarge
I
local production, the general
growth of the economy will
require more imports more
imports for the purposes of
.industry, let alone consumption.
“There is here a general
problem, which has three main
elements. One is to strengthen
our capacity to export and to
enlarge markets overseas. A
second is to save imports by
expanding output of local pro-
ducts where this is an economic
proposition. A third is to
attract overseas investment to
supplement our own resources.
“It can be said at once that
there is no. essential conflict
between any of these objectives
and the broad aim of keeping
our economy fully employed
and providing a steady rate of
local expansion. On the con-
trary, all these objectives are
likely to be promoted by main-
taining local activity and
growth. Larger exports imply
greater local production, and
so does the replacement of
imports by locally produced
goods. Capital is more likely
to be attracted if the country
is moving ahead than if it is
stagnating. But it would be
great folly to suppose that, to
achieve these objectives, noth-
ing more is required than to
stimulate local activity by any
means at hand.”
In other words, inflationary
financial expedients during
times of recession—the “shots-
in-the-arm” recommended by
Sydney “Herald” would be
disastrous.
Burns Philp At It Again!
A lthough the shai emarket
had sensed that something
was coming from Burns Philp
for several weeks past, an-
nouncement of the second
bonus-issue in just over a year
had something diverting about
it. Like a man taking en-
thusiastically to bowls after an
almostTifelong aversion to the
game, for instance.
Before last year’s bonus-
issue, the previous gift-issue
was in 1919, though the co.’s
affluence, especially on the in-
vestment side, has been the
theme of sharemarket discus-
sion for a quarter of a century.
Last year’s issue was one-for-
four, calling for £1 million, and
taking paid capital to £5
million. This year’s issue is
one-for-five, also calling for £1
million, and capital will rise to
£6 million. Maintenance of the
10 p.c. div. on the increased
capital seems assured. The
disclosed profit, after setting
aside £297,488 for depreciation
(against £491,995 in the pre-
vious year) and £500,000 (un-
changed) for asset - replace-
ment, was shown at
£833,906 (against £580,122). A
10 p.c. dividend on the new
capital will call for £600,000.
The present bonus will be
financed from revaluation of
assets, probably investments.
The board, in its annual re-
port, speaks more optimisti-
cally than usual even of its
Pacific-islands shipping acti-
vities.
It has been suggested from
several quarters that the latest
bonus-issue has been prompted
by fears of an attempted take-
over by overseas interests. In
any case, the move has had
the effect of lifting B.P. shares
to 825., cum bonus, to give an
<?*-bonus yield of under 3 p.c.
on a continued 10 p.c. basis.
The possibility of an over-
seas ■ takeover of a large but
relatively “family” concern like
B.P. causes the imagination to
fly to the possibility of such
a thing happening to more
public Australian investment
institutions.
Even Broken Hill Proprietary
comes to mind. What a sitting
shot B.H.P. would make for
a really big U.S. steel or
metals concern!

AMPOL'S CAPITAL EXPANSION
A fter the present issue of six-
million ss. ords. being
made at par by Ampol
Petroleum, Ltd., is completed
(applications close on May 29),
subscribed capital will be
£11,461,645 in a million £1 pref.
shares and 41,846,581 ss. ords.,
all paid-up by September this
year.
Including the present issue, he
would now hold 3080 ords. of
ss. each (they were subdivided
in 1952) at a total cost, with the
call payable in September, of
£825 13s. At the present price
of over 21s. for the fully-paids,
his holding would be worth
approximately £3234, showing
him a capital-profit of £2408 —
nearly three times his total in-
vestment.
In 1949 capital was
£1,250,000.
Over the past 10 years
Ampol’s capital-expansion has
been dynamic, not to say
boronic. The following table
shows how the person 'who
bought 100 Ampol £1 ords.

had its large capital spread
among 50,652 shareholders.
Because of its necessary policy
of expansion, and its heavy
ploughing-back of profits, it
has limited its dividend to 8-j-
-p.c. in recent years. Even
though its shares are dearly
priced at 535. from the private
Australian investor’s point of
view, for the big U.S. corpora-
tion with abundant finance the
real earning-power of the busi-
ness would justify a high price
for the shares.
If there was any evidence
that such a takeover was con-
templated the time would have
arrived to call for a review of
our policy of attracting dollar
investments to Australia. In
Britain the same sort of thing
is already a hot subject.
For Three-year Holding
TT is difficult indeed in today’s
-*■ high-priced sharemarket to
pick stocks which are likely to
justify their valuations over six
or 12 months. But to anybody
prepared to wait for three years
for benefits the position is
not quite so obscure.
In B. 6/5/ ’59 Mauri Bros,
and Thomson ords. were sug-
gested as being in this category,
and reasons were given. Last
week Cuming Smith shares
were analysed in detail, and
it was said that “longish-term
prospect's seem to be most
impressive, especially when
considered in relation to the .
massive group asset-backing.”
On Melbourne ’Change,
Cuming Smith shares have
since risen from 395. to 445. 3d.,
but still fall into the category
of promising three-year hold-
ing, in spite of the attitude of
the Federal Government to the
sulphuric-acid bounty.
Another stock which cannot
be overlooked in the three-year
class is Henry Jones. At 555.
it has shown very little appre-
ciation this year, and is well
below the highest price of
previous years. It has amassed
large visible reserves, and
obviously has great inner
strength, as well as a very
respectable disclosed earning-
power pven under the competi-
tive conditions of the past few
years.
The greater part of earnings
which have been exhibited
over the past 20 years have
been locked-up in this com-
pany, and shareholders have
had little more than their
10 p.c. during a long period
of build-up. There hasn’t been
a bonus-issue since 1927.
Sulphuric-acid Bounty
'T'hough the Tariff Board, in
a report tabled in the Can-
berra Representatives last week,
recommended the continuance
of the bounty on sulphuric
acid made from Australian
pyrites, and that existing limi-
tations on profits as a condi-
tion to receipt of the bounty
be discontinued, the Federal
Government has decided to
continue the bounty for one
year only from July 1 next,
though companies which co-
operated in the pyrites project
when overseas sulphur was
scarce or dear will be looked
after even when next year’s
bounty arrangements expire.
Termination of the bounty
on June 30, 1960, apparently
means, that those companies
which designed their plant to
handle local pyrites instead of
imported brimstone will con-
tinue to receive a bounty on
their production, but new out-
lay after June 30, 1960, on
plant so designed will no longer
receive Government sponsor-
ship or bounty.
The Tariff Board began its
inquiry in November, 1957,
though its report has just been
tabled. The Government now
proposes to ask the board to
report on what the bounty
should be after June 30, 1960,
in view of the changed raw-
materials position,
Sulphur, like most minerals
and metals, is now so abund-
ant overseas that its price has
fallen heavily, and this, aided
by a fall in shipping freights
since the Suez* crisis, has helped
in a cut in the price of

sulphuric acid and super-
phosphate by Australian pro-
ducers.
Apart from countering the
previously high cost of
imported sulphur, the bounty
on acid produced from Aus-
tralian pyrites has helped the
mining industry, particularly in
the States of Queensland, Tas-
mania and W.A. Mining com-
panies in these States had a
great deal to do with the estab-
lishment of the acid and
fertiliser industries in Australia
to begin with.
In its last annual report
Commonwealth Fertilisers and
Chemicals, Ltd. (B. 13/5/’59),
reported that “Australian
pyrites continues to be the
principal raw material used in
our production of sulphuric
acid, a large proportion of our
acid - manufacturing capacity
having been either built or
converted for this purpose
since 1934.”
Presumably output from this
plant will continue to be sub-
ject to the acid bounty, and it
and similar plant will continue
to use pyrites from Mt. Lyell,
Norseman, Mt. Morgan and
other mines.
Queensland TV
Allotment-letters are our.
for the oversubscribed float
of Queensland Television, Ltd.
Disappointed applicants are
expected to ensure that the
shares open at a substantial
premium.
Queensland TV may not go
to the heights of Brisbane TV
—ss.-paid shares are now sell-
ing at 14s. 3d.—mainly because
of the h gher denomination of
the shares (pa'd to 205.).
There could be some heavy
selling in the opening days by
investors seeking a quick profit.
This float probably attracted
many such investors following
the success of Brisbane TV.
Testing is expected to start
in June, ahead of Brisbane
TV.
Programmes have been
arranged with ATN, which
operates Channel 9, in Sydney,
and from America. Telecasting
is expected to start in late Sep-
tember or early October.
M.K.1.-Factors
Queensland Mines, Ltd.,
has announced the commer-
cial potential of a new uranium-
field outside Mount Isa. The
lease —Anderson’s Lode is
reported to have known com-
mercial possibilities provided
a satisfactory method of treat-
ing the ore can be devised.
Queensland Mines is a com-
pany whose shareholding is
held 51 p.c. by Dominion Pty.,
Ltd. (a wholly-owned sub-
sidiary of Factors, Ltd.), and
49 p.c. by A.O.E. (whose shares
are now held by Mary Kath-
leen Investments, Ltd.).
The British Atomic Energy
Commission, together with the
Department of Mines in
Queensland, have provided
finance for the Qniversity of
Queensland to develop a
method by which the uranium-
ore can be treated. The Uni-
versity claims that a suitable
and economical method of
treatment has been found. The
University now plans to install
a pilot-plant on the field.
Factors has agreed to finance
the establishment of a plant,
within Mount Isa, provided
that a satisfactory contract is
obtained.
Known ore reserves are in
the vicinity of 800,000 tons,
which puts a gross value of
approximately £l5 million on
the field.
Bolte’s Grand Tour
[From Melbourne]
TViplomatic recognition for
Bolte’s Grand Tour may
have added some indefinable
prestige for the members of the
party, but the results so far
seem to be chiefly diplomatic
immunity from the news.
Compared with his previous
tour, when there were daily
communiques about his pro-
gress, he has had on this occa-
sion quite a poor press.
After cocktails in San Fran-
cisco and Los Angeles, includ-
ing a noggin with Gregory
Peck, he seemed to get lost
somewhere (at a guess, in the
Rockies); but he has now
turned up, with the party, alive
and well, in Chicago, “after
meeting most leading business
and financial men.”
He has a good story to tell
U.S. dollar-investors, such as
the most rapid growth, surpass-
ing the U.S.’s at any stage;
the lowest (1.7) p.c. unemploy-
ment-rate in the world ; and a
strong Stock Exchange. And
Menzies, hard on his heels, may
be relied on to keep a sly
silence about who can claim
credit for it.
Cash Orders and Latec
TI/'hen Latec Investments
made a take-over offer to
Cash Orders (Q.), Ltd. (six
Latec for every one Cash
Orders share), Cash Orders
shareholders had every reason
to be pleased. The offer, cum
dividend, was equivalent to
495.
The deal went through, and
now, on the issue of Latec scrip
to the Cash Orders share-
holders, Latec has risen by
Is. 3d. from its price at the time
of the offer to 9s. 3d. This puts
a price of 555. 6d. on the
Queensland Cash Orders £1
shares.
Even at 9s. 3d. there could
be room for an improvement
in Latec’s shares. Except for
the first year, when a dividend
of 10 p.c. was paid, the co. has
paid a well-covered 15 p.c. p.a.


MAORLAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY
Wellington, May 12, 1959.
'There is no doubt that the
electors of Hamilton spoke
for the rest of N.Z. when they
administered a sharp rebuke to
the Government in the recent
by-election.
They gave the National
party’s new and relatively un-
known candidate more than
double the majority with
which his popular predecessor,
the late Dame Hilda Ross, was
returned in 1957.
The Prime Minister, Mr.
Nash, attributed the National-
party victory to “superb
organisation,” but everyone
knows that’s not the answer.
The answer in one word is;
“Taxes.”
The electors are angry with
the Government because they
feel they were fooled by the
1957 election promise of a
tax-rebate. The rebate was
given all right, but it was
quickly followed by the most
savage tax-increases in N.Z.'s
history.
The electors were not so
much fooled as foolish. They
were wooed by two parties,
both making extravagant
promises. They accepted the
biggest bribe and got what they
deserved.
Whether they have learnt a
lasting lesson remains to be
seen/ It seems unlikely.
Most people will agree with
the N.Z. Constitutional Society,
which sees an urgent need to
put an end to “bribery and
mass-covetousness as features
of electoral activity.” But
when it comes to the point,
that’s easier said than done.
The only real hope seems to
lie in better and more wide-
spread education in economics.
It's no use reiterating the fact
that the Government can't
give the people anything with-
out first taking it from them.
Everyone knows that it can
take from some to give to
others. That is what it has
been doing for years.
Those from whom it has
taken in ever-increasing
amounts include the most
energetic and enterprising of
the community, and those to
whom it has given include the
most lazy and shiftless.
Nevertheless, a good many
people who believe they are on
the receiving-end of these trans-
actions are, in fact, on the
giving-end. Many others, who
may be on the receiving-end
now, fail to realise that they
will be on the giving-end in the
future and for the greater
part of their lives. A better
knowledge of economics
would open their eyes to the
facts and promote a more
sceptical attitude to election
bribery.
Borrowing Rates
The Government is seeking
a works loan of £l5 million.
Investors are offered long-
term stock, maturing October,
15, 1971-73 at 4i per cent.;
medium-term, maturing Oct-
ober 15, 1965, also at 4\ per
cent.; or short-term, maturing
October 15, 1962, at 4\ per
cent.
The interest-rates are the
same as those offered during
the last two years. Both
ordinary and death-duty stock
are available.
Death-duty stock is accepted
at full face-value for the pay-
ment of income-tax or death-
duty by the estate of the
holder.
The interest-rates are rather
less than can be obtained in
the market. Current short-
term issues have been showing
an average final maturity
yield of about 4| per cent.;
medium and long-term, up to
4| per cent.
Imports for Factories
In an attempt to ensure that
N.Z.’s manufacturing expan-
sion is not retarded, the
Government has decided to
provide an additional £ll
million of overseas exchange
during the next two years for
the import of capital-goods for
new and existing industries.
The allocation will be over and
above provision already made
in the existing import-licensing
schedule.
The fund will be adminis-
tered by the industrial-develop-
ment division of the Depart-
ment of Industries and Com-
merce. One of the measuring-
rods to be used in considering
proposals will be the likelihood
of the industry concerned being
able to stand on its own feet,
without undue protection.
The Government has given
as one of its reasons for the
extra allocation a desire to
ensure that N.Z. manufac-
turers are not placed at a dis-
advantage in comparison with
overseas financial interests,
whose capital-holdings outside
N.Z. could be used as an argu-
ment for early establishment of
a particular industry.
In general, manufacturers
have greeted the scheme with
approval, but there are several
questions that need answering.
It is obvious that the Govern-
ment, through the Department
of Industries and Commerce,
has taken for itself a new, direct
control over industrial expan-
sion. There is a grave risk
of increased bureaucratic inter-
ference in business.
Professor H. R. Rodwell,
associate professor of eco-
nomics at Auckland University,
has rightly said that the scheme
could be dangerous if alloca-
tions to industries are not
based on sound economic prin-
ciples.
Foreign Exchange
A surplus of £26.4 million
was achieved by N.Z. in foreign-
exchange transactions in the
financial year ended March 31.
This compared with a deficit
of £39.7 million in the previous
year.
On current account there was
a deficit of £18.2 million,
against a deficit of £47.6 the
previous year. Overseas
borrowing by the Government
amounted to £44.8 million,
against only £400,000 the pre-
vious year.
Export receipts were well
maintained at £273.6 million,
only £400,000 below the 1957-
58 total. A drop of £25.2
million to £76.8 million in re-
ceipts from wool was offset by
improved returns from meat
(up £11.4 million), butter (up
£8.6 million) and cheese (up
£5.4 million). “Other” exports
yielded £600,000 less.
As a result of stringent con-
trols, private imports fell by
£39.4 million to £226.9 million.
Government imports were re-
duced by £1 million to £28.9
million.
Net overseas assets are con-
tinuing to rise satisfactorily. At
April 29 they stood at £85.2
million, against £48.7 million a
year before.
Export returns have held up
considerably better than was
expected. Mr. J. J. Watts,
Minister of Finance in the last
National Government, has pre-
dicted that overseas earnings
in 1959 may approach, or beat,
those of 1957.
National Consumers’ Council
A National Consumers’
Council and district consumer-
committees in the four main
centres are being establised by
the Government.
The council and committees,
to consist of well-known
citizens yet to be chosen, will
deal with all matters of con-
cern to consumers —: for ex-
ample, shortage of goods and
services, inferior quality,
adulteration, health and safety
hazards, lack of desirable
standards, excessive prices,
legal inequalities and loan and
credit malpractices.
_ On receiving suggestions and
complaints from consumers, the
council and committees will
investigate them and propose
remedies, but primarily the aim
will be to interpret consumers’
needs and views to the pro-
ducers of goods and services.
In general, import-restric-
tions have not greatly affected
production and employment in
N.Z., although they appear to
have reduced the pace of expan-
sion of some industries, states
the survey of business condi-
tions for the last quarter of
1958, made by the Department
of Industries and Commerce.
Industries producing goods
of a type subject to import-
restrictions recorded higher
orders and production com-
pared with the fourth quarter
of 1957. On the other hand, a
fall in sales occurred for indus-
tries serving the farmer, for
industries depending largely on
hire-purchase sales, and for
higher-priced commodities, in-
cluding electric appliances.

Souzay in Sydney
la his first recital at Syd-
ney Con. the French baritone,
in a programme as widely
diversified and searching as a
singer could devise, revealed
him Self as an artist of aston-
ishing gifts. His range goes
up rather than down:—he can
sustain an A with comfort. He
can color his tone to an
amazing degree ; and he can
when necessary but never
merely for effect —call on a
strong resonance. His techni-
cal equipment is so complete
that he can forget the mere
mechanics of voice-production
and concentrate on interpreta-
tion ; and here he would have
few peers. He is especially a
master of the art rare in
baritones—of /ega/p-singing on
the half-voice high in range.
He gave classical proof of
this mastery in Grieg’s delight-
ful “Along the River” and
“Chanson Epique” serene
singing, this, and of great
beauty. It was also effectively
adapted to the soft Iberian
rhythms of one of Ravel’s.
“Don Quixote” songs.
The setting of a psalm by the
early German composer
Schutz and a sacred song by
C. P. E. Bach were deeply
spiritual utterances. A group
of Schubert lieder included the
Romance from “Rosamunde,”
its nuances suffused with the
true romantic glow; “The
Wanderer,” one of Schubert's
great songs, to which Souzay,
by some uncanny metamor-
phosis, lent his voice a mystical
quality perfectly suited to the
song’s mood ; “Happiness,” its;
swinging lilt converted into a
surge of ecstasy; and “Un-
geduld,” a captivatingly
original interpretation, with
real impatience in every bar.
One of the rare occasions
when Souzay called on his full
resonance was in the swelling
emotion of Valentine’s big aria
from “Faust” ; yet even here
the essential tenderness and
poignancy of the soldier’s fare-
well to his sister were always
apparent.
Probably, his best singing
went into the bracket of five
songs by Duparc, all of which
make great challenges to a
singer’s intellectual capacity.
The delicate “Extase,” the
beautifully phrased “Serenade,”
the intense “Regret,” “Floren-
tine” and, loveliest of all, “In-
vitation to the Voyage”—
Souzay went straight to the
heart of them all. And here,
too, the Dalton
Baldwin, gave the best of a
collaboration that never fell
from a high standard through-
out.

“Roar Like a Dove”
Lesley Storm’s well - made
comedy came well rehearsed
to Sydney Royal from Mel-
bourne ; a first-rate entertain-
ment in which the American
wife of a Scottish lord calls
her father and mother over
from America to stop her hus-
band adding to their six daugh-
ters in an effort to get himself
a son.
The father’s attempt to
satisfy his son-in-law’s hunger
for continuity with the heir-
male to the title, a young city
cousin, is foiled by the cousin’s
distaste for the ugly fecundity
of farm-life. By this time the
father-in-law has come round
to the lord’s point of view ; he
incites and organises his
daughter’s seduction by her
husband. Next day daughter,
daughters, and mother-in-law
depart in anger for America,
whence they return to have the
new baby—and what will it be?
The slight plot is brilliant
theatre; there is something
impudent, for instance, in mak-
ing a play turn on the seduc-
tion of a wife by her own
husband ; and again, the return
of the wife, full of bragga-
docio about her social
triumphs, tiara and all, in
America, when everyone
knows, and. is waiting for her.
to disclose, the human but
humiliating condition which
has enforced her return, and
which also overshadows her
alleged conquests of young and
handsome men and neutralises
her threats of divorcing her
husband—this is one of the fine
comic suspenses of theatre, and
thoroughly exploited by the
playwright.
In a play which should be
an easy walk-through for
amateurs, the cast is better
than average: Googie Withers
speaks American as Katharine
Hepburn speaks English ; she
plays the American wife with
force and farce rather than
with ease and humor. John
McCallum, as her husband, is
at all times natural and charm-
ing ; the American actors
Florence Dunlap and Edward
Cullen, as the mother-in-law
and father-in-law, are finely in
keeping; Noel Ferrier makes
a graceful portrait of the friend
of the family ; Alistair Roberts
sustains the comic bravura of
a city youth shocked and
frightened by farm-life (his
cadenza on the awfulness of
everything is something to
see and hear); and Christina
Groves, as the little daughter
Jane, is as nice and clear-
voiced and well-bred a little
menace as one hopes to see on
a stage.

A.B.C.’s Competition
Of the eight artists—four
pianists and four singers—who
contested the N.S.W. State
Finals of the A.B.C.’s Vocal
and Concerto Competition,
seven were girls ; and the only
man —baritone Waverley Ford,
who sang Rigoletto’s big aria,
“Vile Race of Courtiers” —
was outsung in every depart-
ment by the winner, Lina
Denison, who brought a con-
tralto of rich quality and really
booming power to “Ye Powers
That Dwell Below,” from
Gluck’s “Alceste.” Though it
still has rough edges to it,
Miss Denison’s voice holds
great possibilities.
Of the two lyric-sopranos,
Patricia Wooldridge showed-
up the better with a well-
controlled half-voice in the
lepeated “Salce ” episodes of
the “Willow Song” from
Verdi’s “Otello.” All her head-
notes rang clear, but she was
short on carrying-capacity in
the low register. Wendy De
Beyer produced an attractive
tone and facile flexibility in
Debussy’s colorless “Air De
Lia,” which, for a singer who
has yet to master light and
shade, was an unfortunate
choice.
In the instrumental section
the judges 'had a harder job,
for here the talent was more
uniform. Irene Pang got a
close decision on points—and
some quite good points—with
a reading of the extended
opening movement of the
Brahms B Flat Concerto which,
if not electrifying, certainly
had some moments of
dynamism. Her climax-build-
ing was most impressive.
Always in easy command, her
strength was in the clarity of
her phrasing.
The Adagio and Rondo from
Brahms’s other concerto, the
D Minor, was given a neat
but insufficiently forceful
treatment by Margaret Huth-
waite. There was a similar
weakness in Josephine Doyle’s
playing of the first allegro
from Beethoven’s Fourth Con-
certo in G Major.
Joseph Post, conducting the
Sydney Symphony Orchestra,
gave all the contestants the
maximum of tonal help in
stating their cases.

“Career”
In a stream of changing
scenes, James Lee’s play (at
Sydney Independent) takes 16
short, hard looks into the 25-
year struggle of an American
actor obsessed with a desire
for fame. At the end the actor
is a star ; but he has suffered
poverty and hunger, lost two
wives, thrown away his per-
sonal integrity, been patronised
and bullied by theatrical bosses
and persecuted by a Senate
sub-committee —in short, has
given a fair indication that
there’s practically nothing he
wouldn’t sacrifice or tolerate
to get his name in lights.
Why did he want fame so
badly? We’re not told. Was
it worth the price when it
came? We’re left in some
doubt. To use a dust-jacket
cliche, the author points no
moral and takes no sides. What
he apparently intends to con-
vey, besides the intensity of
his hero’s struggle, is a wistful
sense of loss-in-achievement—
the familiar American sadness
over crushed innocence.
Both these feelings were too
often missing in Doris Fitton’s
production, which, though
interesting and sometimes

arresting in its use of back-
grounds projected from film-
slides, was generally short of
emotional scope and variety
of pace. Certain scenes could
have been gathered more
quickly into a climax; others
could have been slowed-down
to let a time lapse or the sense
of loss sink in.
The actors worked their way
honestly and carefully along the
main line of the story, but
were mostly uncertain in de-
veloping character and did not
seem able to reach for the big
emotion when it was called for.
Robert McDarra, for
example, though he kept a feel-
ing of humanity flowing
through his portrait of. the
actor, failed to show enough
of the weight of years and loss
as the play advanced. Don
Pascoe was a little more suc-
cessful as the actor’s director-
friend, arrogant in success,
cowed and edgy in failure.
Betty Dyson and Diana, David-
son were adequate as, respec-
tively, a hard-crusted but sym-
pathetic theatre-agent and the
love-hungry daughter of a pro-
ducer.

Musica Viva
The M.V. Society last week
called on resident artists —six
string-players and a pianist,
led by Ernest Llewellyn—for
a concert devoted entirely to
classics.
Haydn’s Quartet, Op. 74, No.
1., was notable for the virility
and balance of the first allegro
and the well-measured ele-
gance of the andantino. In the
big Mozart C Major Quintet,
K. 515, the deeply introspective
mood of the first movement
was well held, and the best
playing of the night went into
the tender dialogue between
Llewellyn’s violin and Robert
Pikler’s viola in the andante ;
but in the intricate final rondo
complete integration escaped
the players.
Romola Constantino was at
the keyboard in the Schubert
A Major Piano Quintet (“The
Trout”), and she played with
crisp attack. The variations
on the famous song-theme, and
the incidental figurations and
ornamentation were wrought
with admirable smoothness.
Political Play
In “Julius Caesar,” as played
by the Genesians in Sydney,
Mr. Shakspeare is obviously
taking a shot at the Salaries
Grab.- The satire is disguised
by such devices as substituting
a p.-r. man, Mark Antony, for
the Richardson Committee, and
Rome for Canberra, but to the
cognoscenti the meaning is
plain enough.
Not content with satirising
the politicians, Mr. Shakspeare
knocks the press, and his
common man, in the crowd
scenes, is a gullible larrikin.
There is also an offensive
reference to the mob’s “stink-
ing breath” which, besides
being undemocratic, is mani-
festly unfair to advertisers of
dentrifices. In short, this
Shakspeare is a knocker, not
a booster.
His Caesar is vain and ambi-
tious, but the conspirators, with
the exception of Brutus a
high-minded stooge are an
envious lot. And, after listen-
ing to a speech on “together-
ness” by Brutus’s wife an
attractive, barefooted lass in a
startlingly modest nightgown
—one wonders about Brutus,
too.
Liberties have been taken
with history. For instance,
Caesar doesn’t get the rise: on
his way to the Senate to collect
it he is shot-down by a gang
of conspirators led by Cassius
(a backroom-boy in a black
Homburg) and the simple-
minded Brutus. The point Mr.
Shakspeare seems to be trying
to make here is that politics is
a bloody business, anyway.
Perhaps for the sake of
realism, Caesar does not grab
the crown (i.e., the rise) when
it is offered to him by Antony:
he brushes it aside three times.
And the denunciation of the
conspirators (the press) comes
not from Caesar himself but
from the p.-r. man over Caesar’s
corpse. It is a good deal more
subtle than Mr. Menzies’s
similar denunciation —it causes
the mob to rend a poet.
Playing “Julius Caesar” in
modern dress is intended to
underline the point that the
more things change, the more
they are the same. In this pur-
pose, for one viewer at least,
the play succeeded: A general
flatness in the acting contribut-
ed to the impression. It was
easier to imagine the people on
the stage as a bunch of local
boys playing politics than
Romans whose quarrels con-
vulsed the civilised world.
Kevin Healey’s choleric Cassius
was the most forceful perform-
ance, although Barry Jenkins,
as Mark Antony, built up the
funeral oration effectively.
J. F.
Artbursts
Dickerson
Robert Dickerson’s big
paintings, with their curious air
of Middle European gloom,
should be well enough known
to most Sydney art-watchers
by now.
Up to a point, in his exhibi-
tion at Farmer’s Blaxland
Gallery, they are ingenious and
effective, with their grotesque,
foreshortened figures crouching
or lolling almost in mid-air,
clean outside the frame, and
the square-cut or triangular
faces which, elementary as they
are, successfully convey the
moods of slyness or sadness.

But their effectiveness is
essentially that of the cartoon
or the poster. “Guy,” for in-
stance, the wistful boy alone
in an immense desolation, says
essentially the same thing as
Drysdale’s painting of the little
girl dancing in the desert; but
says it with such simplification
of means and mood, such
poverty of technical finesse,
that it hardly begins to be art.
Dickerson has finished with it,
in one swift symbolisation of
the idea, before Drysdale would
have begun.
Tt is (comparatively) easy to
get a dramatic effect by paint-
ing very large ; it is easier to
paint gloom and horror than
the equally valid moods of
delight. But even if, beyond
their point of cleverness, the
paiatings are facile, the artist’s
feeling for contemporary life
remains promising. One would
like to see what he can do on a
much smaller scale, with a
more subtle technique and
more variety of mood.
Films
“The Great Adventure”
There is enchantment in
every minute of this Swedish
film, photographed in muted
black-and-white with- the same
artistry as “One Summer of
Happiness.” Set by lake and
forest, it tells of two brothers
—one 10, the other six—who
rescue an otter from a fisher-
man, make it their secret pet
and surreptitiously feed it with
their own slender resources
through an iron-hard winter.
Arne Sucksdorff, who wrote,
photographed, edited and
directed the film, has with
remarkable insight and fidelity
gone straight to the hearts and
minds of children, showing
with beautiful simplicity the
easy camaraderie that can exist
between young animals, both
human and wild.
On the same programme is
“Marcelino,” a Spanish film
which, like “The Great Ad-
venture,” deals with childhood
and is a Cannes Festival first-
prize winner. It concerns the
solemn but comic endeavors cf
a grpup of monks to bring-up
a healthy and inquiring orphan
boy, and their sorry attempts
at discipline when he indulges
in such peccadillos as putting
paper-boats in the holy-water
font or tying two friars together
by their habit-cords.
Towards the end the boy
evokes a miracle when he
comes upon a statue of the
Man on the Cross in a for-
bidden attic; but, though
reverently treated, this cannot
match what has gone before.
The boy, Pablito Calvo, with
his great dark eyes and swift
changes from innocent wonder
to gaiety and mischief, is
irresistible.

“The Sound and the Fury”
A smooth version of William
Faulkner’s complex novel, with
Yul Brynner skilful in the
central role of the outsider who
feels obliged to keep intact a
played-out family of *fhe Deep
South because he once had an
affair with its totally amoral
daughter.
Joanne Woodward calls on
some clever effects in her
portrayal of the girl; but
director Martin Ritt has won
the most satisfying perform-
ance from Margaret Leighton,
as the vain and fading ex-
mistress desperately trying to
maintain a way of life that is
physically beyond her.
At Sydney Regent.
“The Whole Truth”
Although the plot of this
whodunit has more holes in it
than your old gardening pull-
over, it has been slickly
fashioned by a director who
knows how to screw tension to
a good pitch and when best
to halt a good incidental score
for the best dramatic effect.
He is also well served by his
chief actors—Stewart Granger,
as the philandering film-pro-
ducer suspected of murdering
his former mistress ; and suave
George Sanders, as a homicidal
publisher of religious literature.

“Tom Thumb”
Producer George Pal has
taken the Grimm Brothers’
fairytale and, with an admix-
ture of live people, puppets,
cartoons, trick-pho'tography
and catchy music, has made it
into a charming film for
children. For good measure
there is expert dancing, a
seasoning of excitement, and a
liberal sprinkling of humor
(supplied mostly by Terry-
Thomas as a none-so-bold
robber).

The WILD CAL
COLUMN
Dalgety and Co., Ltd.
A detailed review of Dalgety and Co.
needs little apology, even granting
that Australasian interest in the ordinary
capital of this London-controlled com-
pany is strictly limited, totalling only
about 15.7 p.c. of the £stg.6 million
issued thus far. As the world's premier
woolbroking house, Dalgety would still
be of intrinsic local interest were its
stock unlisted.
Leaving equity capital aside, Dalgety
will also be of interest to the investor
looking around for sound fixed-interest
paper. Last month a prospectus was
filed in Australia for an issue at par
(£A 100) for £A1,500,000 of secured
notes with a six- or 10-years’ term
carrying interest at the rate of 7 p.c.
p.a. Taken together with Australian
notes already issued, these notes, after
allowing for borrowings with priority as
regards security, have at least £B7B in
net tangibles behind them for every
£AIOO.
Th : s particular issue forms only part
of the £stg.6 million which the board
has deemed it expedient to raise in the
current year to cope with the rapid
increase in the totals of advances to
clients, and the slowing-down in the
rate of re-collections with the advent
of relatively harder times in primary
industries. Bank advances, as shown
by the balance - sheet below, rose
enormously over the year to June 30
last, exceeding at times £stg.7 million.
The balance of the £stg.6 million has
been raised recently through £stg.3-
million of 6‘ p.c. redeemable (1979/84)
debenture stock, issued in the U.K.; and
by the issue of 1,650,000 20s. stg. ords.
at 4s. stg. premium on the basis of three
for eight held last February. Amount
payable in Australian currency was
30s. Id.
Ordinary share capital has grown
fourfold since_ 1952, when it was £stg. 14-
million in six-million 20s. "shares paid
to ss. In 1953, there was a capitalisation
of £stg.9oo,ooo applied as a bonus to
increasing by 3s. the amount paid-up
on ordinary shares, which were then
redesignated “A” shares. This was
followed by a cash issue of Bs. “B” ords.
at par on a two-for-five basis.
Both classes of share-capital were
consolidated into one-class 20s. shares
in 1957 and former “A” shareholders
received as compensation for the loss
of certain rights one additional ord.
for 50 held. A cash issue followed
closely, 870,000 shares being offered on
a one-for-four basis at a premium of
ss. 6d. stg. Following completion of the
latest issue, paid ordinary capital stands
at £stg.6 million, co-partnered by £stg. 11-
million of 5| p.c. prefs.
Altogether, wool prices notwithstand-
ing, the past year has brought share-
holders their fair share of good tidings,
not least of which was the admission of
the company as an overseas trading
corporation under U.K. taxation law
during 1957-58, whereby it is exempted
in many important respects from the
rather ruthless U.K. tax-scale. Taxation
levied on profits will now be governed
by rates ruling in countries where
Dalgety operates.
Previously, pre-tax earnings had been
subject to a 424 p.c. company-tax, plus
a profits - tax at 30 p.c. on the gross
amount distributed in dividends; and
at 3 p.c. on the remaining undistributed
profits. Profits - tax was, however, re-
duced to a fiat 10 p.c. on the distribut-
able residue by the 1957 Budget.
As before, dividends were paid net
after deduction of U.K. income-tax of
424 p.c. (standard rate), but Australian
shareholders may claim a rebate under
the double-tax agreement with the U.K.
The benefits of this concession are
immediately evident from the profit

Profit before taxation actually fell
quite heavily in 1957 - 58 from
£5tg.1,941,404 to £stg. 1,520,328. Yet net
profit itself was a record, rising by
£5tg.35,796 to £5tg.825,835, after pro-
viding an estimated £5tg.694,493 for
taxation (compared with £5tg.1,151.365
in 1956-57); and £5tg.521,844 for
depreciation (£490,504). The taxation
provision, incidentally, includes income-
tax deducted on dividends paid, besides
company- and profit-tax.
Dalgety and Co. was incorporated in
England in 1884, welding together a
number of already well-established
partnerships in Australia and New
Zealand. In 1927 activities- were ex-
tended to British East Africa.
Business in these countries is carried
on largely through branches, and in
the U.K. through a recently-registered
subsidiary, Dalgety London, Ltd.; so
the organisation as a whole is very
closely integrated. Although the storage,
handling and classification of wool holds
pride of place in company dealings, a
very large slice of the business embraces
livestock and land, and the all-important
financing of farmers and graziers pend-
ing sale of clips, stock, crops, etc.
Produce of all types is handled, in-
cluding pasture seeds, and a general
retailing and wholesaling business covers
just about everything. Dalgety also
appears in the role of wharf-owner,
stevedore, bonded storeman and ship-
ping, travel and insurance agent; it is,
in fact, a twentieth-century East India
Company in miniature.
In 1958 the turnover of the merchan-
dising department in Australia alone
was more than £AI6 million, and over-
all it has averaged £stg.2o (£A2S)
million for the past five years.
Two items in the balance-sheet pro-
vide the rationale of the current and
recent issues the reduction of
£stg. 3,726,495 in trade creditors and
clients’ balances, and the £5tg.3,950,935
increase in debtors and advances. The
gap was plugged temporarily by heavy
borrowings from the bank totalling more
than £stg.4 million, and by running-
down cash balances’ Although the
demands of clients for credit-accom-
modation aren’t likely to have abated in
the current year, the fresh money will
relieve a heavy strain on Dalgety’s
liquid resources. This has nothing to do
with theoretical working-capital which is in
abundant supply for normal operations':

into account the new-issue scrip and
£330,000 of share premiums, is 435.
sd. stg. (= A; 545. 3d.). Assets were
revalued by some £stg. 1,700,489 in
1953. Current market price of
the scrip is 475., and the yield
3.7 p.c from an anticipated effective
“tax-free” dividend-rate of 7 p.c., or a
little over 12 p.c. gross. The gross yield
would be 6.4 p.c., but income - tax is
collected at source in the U.K., and the
rebate for local shareholders is the
lesser of the U.K. and Australian taxes
—after making application for any re-
fund, a rather messy affair for the small
investor.
The half-yearly report to December
31 last was tinged with caution, and
hinted at a substantial reduction of
profits for the current year, which, of
course, was to be expected. While the
company has a fine record as a div.-
payer, retention of the lion’s share of
profits seems to be a favorite pastime
of Dalgety’s board, and the effects of a
chronic shrinkage in the earning-rate on
capital would probably seep through
to shareholders long before the
safety-margin evaporated.
The increment angle could also be a
trap. Paid-capital had been stagnant
over a long period before the collapse
of the wool boom in 1951-52 forced
Dalgety’s hand. Like many other highly
regarded stocks, it could be a case of
the higher the fewer for new issues.
Burns Philp (South Sea) Co., Ltd-
'Taking a leaf from the account-book
A of its Australian-based namesake
and mentor, Burns Philp (South Sea)
Co., Ltd., leaves at least its common-
or-garden backers, if not in outer dark-
ness, then in a very murky twilight.
Modesty in the treatment of asset-values
goes hand-in-glove with pessimism where
liabilities are concerned, and this line
of approach seems also to govern the
balance on profit-and-loss. Of course,
mindful of rather lean years in the
not-too-distant past, the board is quite
justified in underplaying its hand, pro-
vided only that small-time shareholders
aren’t misled as to the real value of
their equity.
Possibly net earnings as disclosed
today diverge less from reality than
in past years. Gleanings from “inner
reserves” seem to have tapered-off,
whereas 15 years ago they not uncom-
monly exceeded the total of net
profit:

With the new capital gathered-in in
the 1958 term now receiving its full due,
the annual div.-payout has moved up
to £lOO,OOO (accounts are in Fijian
money; Fj.2os. = A. 225. 6d.). Net
profit moved up in sympathy, and was
a record £160,283 (£142,362 in 1958),
after providing for all expenses, includ-
ing depreciation, £61,630 (£75,962). No
further information of any significance
is disclosed, neither group nor sectional
turnover, nor, of course, the all-impor-
tant taxation provision.
A div.-rate of 10 p.c. has been main-
tained easily for 10 years ; but in the
30 years to 1950, the average return to
shareholders had been a rather mediocre
6.7 p.c.
The new capital took the form of a
one-for-three par issue, and this was
B.P.(S.S.)’s first incursion into the share-
market since its formation in Fiji in
1920. Funds were required for the
development of “valuable freehold sites”
at Suva and additions to the fleet of
small inter-island vessels.
Paid capital is now the even million
in 20s. stock-units.
Despite the expiry in 1957 of the
copra contract with the British Ministry
of Food and the requirements of the new
scrip, the company has maintained its
visible earning-rate at a good average
level, last term’s profit equalling 16 p.c.
on paid-capital. Results from branches,
trading-stations and inter-island ship-
ping also have been quite satisfactory.
The\ company, from its base in Fiji,
trades throughout the South Seas. Big-
gest shareholder is the parent Burns
Philp, which, since it passed over this
section of its island business to the
present concern, has maintained a con-
stant two-thirds share-interest.
At the end of last term, January 31,
reserves exceeded paid capital by
£349,602 and, on book-values, the net
tangible asset backing for each 20s. of
scrip was 475. The actual cover was
certainly considerably higher. Since
inception of the co. there has been
nothing in the way of asset-revalua-

Shares in subsidiary, £314,960, refers
to a wholly-owned offshoot in the New
Hebrides, profits of which are taken
into account only to the extent of divi-
dends received. Other investments, to
the tune of £1,026,498, appears to be
very well discounted, and there are also
handsome provisions against stock,
book-debts and fixed-assets. There is
255. 7d.' in cash and investments alone
for each 20s. of share-capital, even
excluding the subsidiary.
Interest in the scrip has picked-up
considerably over the past two years,
stimulated, no doubt, by the Australian
parent’s long - awaited one - for - four
bonus-issue early last year which is to be
supplemented by the rather unexpected
one-for-five bonus coming up later this
year, and the knowledge that the two
boards have a degree of mutual represen-
tation. Units, which a few years ago were
each changing hands at 435. (Australian),
sold recently at 545. 6d., at which price
yield would be 4.1 p.c. at current rates of
exchange. A one-for-four bonus would
lift the return to 5 p.c., assuming an un-
changed div.-rate. The stock appears over-
priced, but mainly in relation to board-
room policy.
Gibson and Howes, Ltd.
/"'heated by drought of the prosperity
enjoyed in the 1957 season by the
sugar industry as a whole, Gibson and
Howes, Ltd., had a far better run last
term, finishing the year to December 31
with net earnings virtually equal to the
peak figure claimed in 1954.
Despite restrictions in accordance with
export-limits accepted under the Inter-
national Sugar Agreement, Australian
sugar production in the 1958 season
reached a record 1,412,000 tons of
(94 n.t.) raw sugar, approximately 120,000
tons higher than the previous season’s
outturn and 85,000 tons above the earlier
record set in the 1954 season.
Actual exports for the calendar year,
however, were down by about 117,000
tons, at 651,058 tons, and included 19,096
tons covering shortfalls by other exporter-
members of the British Commonwealth
Sugar Agreement. Australia’s “negoti-
ated-price” exports under this agreement,
which operates within the framework of
the International agreement, were
unchanged at 300,000 tons, but the price,
negotiated annually, applying to this ton-
nage was increased by £stg. 1 13s. 4d. to
£stg. 43 16s. Bd. a ton. On the other
hand, open-market prices fell sharply,
affecting the value of other export sales
and reducing the overall average return
from £49 ss. to an estimated £45 10s.:

Local sugar production is regulated by a
quota system, the return from production
within the quotas, or “mill-peaks,”
alloted to individual mills determining the
“No. 1 pool” price, a much smaller pay-
ment being made for sugar accepted in
excess of mill-peaks.
Unable to take advantage of a 2000-
ton increase (to 39,000 tons) in its mill- ■
peak in 1957, Gibson and Howes crushed
318,600 tons of cane (up 128,840 tons)
last term for 42,083 tons of raws (up
16,733 tons), the 3083 tons produced in

Capital expenditure during the
year of £112,776 covered the
installation of bulk-handling
equipment at the mill, further
extensions to the tramway-
system and improvements to
plant, the co. drawing on the
bank for an extra £86,769 to
help finance the outlay. Up
£287,631, sundry creditors in-
clude “provisions for taxation,
etc.,” and it would appear that
ihe “etc.” could account for a
fair proportion of the total
figure.
The quota of negotiafed-
price sugar to be exported
under the British Common-
wealth agreement in 1959 has
been increased to 307,500
tons and the price per ton by
£stg. 1 ss. 4d. to £stg. 45 2s.
Meanwhile, abundant supplies
of sugar have forced down
open-market quotes to the
lowest level since the 1939-45
war, despite delays in harvest-
ing the Cuban crop, uncer-
tainty as to that country’s atti-
tude towards the restriction of
production contributing to the
instability of the market.
Although early forecasts are
for excellent crops in most
sugar-growing areas of Queens-
land, production in the coming
season will most probably be
restricted to the aggregate of
milFpeaks in view of the heavy
carry-over of export-sugar
from last season and the
export-limits accepted under the
International agreement. In
this event Gibson and Howes’
output would be limited io
39,000 tons of raws, or 3083
tons less than last term’s out-
put.
Taking its cue from the co.’s
past performances and indi-
cated potential, rather than
from the current weakness of
sugar prices, the sharemarket
values Gibson and Howes’ £1
ords. at 475., cum div. (1.45.),
for an effective return of
£5 ss. 3d. p.c. from a 124 p.c.
distribution. Net tangible cover

McDonnell and East, Ltd.
Orisbane retailer McDonnell
and East, Ltd., lost in ex-
penses last term what it'gained
in gross profit from a “reason-
able” increase in turnover, but
the bare maintenance of earn-
ings, at a quite satisfactory
level, hasn't discouraged buyers
of the co.’s scrip from raising
their bids to the recent, all-
time high of 455.
All set to claim its share of
TV-sales in the northern
capital, McDonnell and East
retails clothing, furniture,
domestic-appliances, etc., from
a freehold department-store
in Brisbane’s George Street,
a substantial mail-order busi-
ness contributing to the overall
results of the 58-year-old
organisation.
Recovering quickly from a
sharp drop in earnings in the
1953-54 term (when portion of
the 8 p.c. ord. div. was taken
from reserves) the co. has since
coped successfully with in-
creasingly keen competition,
sending out comfortably-
covered 10 p.c. divs. in the
1956 and 1957 terms before
introducing the current 124 p.c.
rate in 1958. And as long as
expenses can be kept in check,
especially in regard to credit-
sales of TV-receivers, there
seems no reason to query the
forecast of a “reasonably pro-
sperous” showing in the current
term, made by chairman H.
Fraser East at last month’s
annual meeting. However, as
far as the prospective investor
is concerned, promised, rather
than impending, benefits still
appear as the main attraction.
The only major addition to
share-capital since the co. took
on public status in 1920 arose
from a one-for-two par issue
in 1951 and, while a growing
volume of business could give
shareholders another oppor-
tunity to increase their stake
within the next few years, as
things stood at January 31 last
there was no immediate need
to raise paid capital above the

N.S.W. Lags in
Snowy Scheme
By FRANK DIXON
Tn a survey of the Snowy
A Mountains power - and -
water project in southern
N.S.W. I found that one big
contract had been completed
two years ahead of time, that
all others are certain to be
finished on schedule, and that,
as a result, the estimated cost
of the scheme—£4oo million—
is unlikely to be exceeded.
It was only when I sought
information about the Blower-
ing Dam, which is to be built
by the N.S.W. Government at
an estimated cost of £lB
million, that 1 came up against
a brick wall. “That work is
the responsibility of the Water
Conservation and Irrigation
Commission of N.5.W.,” I was
told. “You had better ask
them about it.”
The commission, when
approached, was mildly sur-
prised that there should be
any suggestion of the dam not
being completed in time to
serve its primary purpose of
storing and regulating water
for irrigation. It regards the
inclusion of the dam generally
in the Snowy Mountains
scheme as “somewhat of an
anomaly,” seeing , that the
generation of electricity will
be “only incidental to its
operation as an irrigation-
storage.”
The commission points-out
that the construction of the
dam was authorised by the
N.S.W. Parliament as far back
as 1951 ; and that under the
recent Snowy Mountains
hydroelectric agreement the
State undertook to build the
dam which, it says, will serve
the same purpose on the
Tumut River as the Hume
Dam will serve on the Murray
when the various upstream
diversion - works have been
completed.
The commission’s aim is to
complete the dam by the time
it is needed for its prime pur-
pose of irrigation, and it
thinks it would be “uneco-
nomic to finish it before then.”
It says further that although
its commitments for other
works will not permit it to
begin building the dam for
several years, all the necessary
investigations “preparatory to
final design and construction
have been completed.”
The commission added
finally that it saw no reason
why the building of the major
works of the Snowy Moun-
tains Authority should not
proceed independently of the
Blowering Dam, and that in
any case “all major works are
subject to year-to-year provi-
sion of the necessary funds
by Parliament.”
Officially, as I have said,
the Snowy Mountains
Tumut Pond Dam, from which water is diverted through a
If-mile pressure-tunnel to the recently-started T-I underground
power-station.
Authority refused to discuss
the Blowering Dam or to say
whether any delay in com-
pleting it is likely to prove
an embarrassment to the
whole scheme; but I learned
unofficially that there is a
good deal of concern at the
failure of the N.S.W. authori-
ties to get ahead with the
work.
The unofficial view is that
the Blowering Dam was sup-
posed to be ready by the time
the waters of the Eucumbene
are diverted to the Tumut
River. This is expected to
take place in August of this
year when the second pair
of turbines are cut-in for the
generation of power in the
T-l underground station. The
first pair of generators were
recently put into operation.
The unofficial view con-
veyed to me is that the N.S.W.
Government’s approach to the
building of the dam has been
“timid”; but I was told also
that in the only practical area
for the building of the reser-
voir the engineers have been
unable to strike bottom, even
at 200 ft., and there is reason
to fear that the whole area
may be a giant clay-and-mud
patch.
Finally it was suggested that
when additional water runs
down the Tumut River to the
Murrumbidgee next August,
the authority and farmers on
the river flats are likely to
suffer “embarrassment.”
When 1 asked the N.S.W.
Water Conservation and Irri-
gation Commission if there
was any likelihood of the
Snowy Mountains Authority
itself undertaking the building
of the Blowering Dam if the
commission does not begin
the work by a certain date,
the reply was, “no answer can
be given to that question as
it involves State and Federal
Government policy.”
T eaving the authority and
the commission to argue
the question of whether or not
any. delay in building the
Blowering Dam is likely to
embarrass the whole scheme,
I found much to interest and
even amaze me in the work
already done. The whole
undertaking can only be
described as colossal. The
area is rich in natural beauty
and is rich also in human
achievement, thanks to the
imagination, courage and skill
of the men who conceived and
planned the project and others
who are completing it in the
face of great difficulties, not
the least of which is the bitter
winter when snow lies deep
on the ground for months on
end and snow-ploughs have to
be used frequently to enable
outdoor work to be carried out.
The Snowy scheme has been
designed to turn the waters
of the Snowy River westward
through the Great Dividing
Range, to the dry plains of
the inland. In the process the
water will be held back by
seven dams and will run
through 15 power-stations,
generating a total of 3,000,000
kilowatts of power., almost
equal to the whole output of
electricity in Australia at .the
present time. In addition to
turning the Snowy from its
natural run it will divert the
previously dammed waters of
the Snowy and its tributary,
the Eucumbene, through long
tunnels under the mountains,/
into the Murray and Murrum-
bidgee rivers, and will eventu-
ally irrigate a thousand square-
miles of country that is now,
because of inadequate rain-
fall, of very little national
value.
What impresses the visitor
most about the Snowy scheme,
apart from s its magnificent
conception, is the thorough-
ness which is going into every
detail of its planning and con-
struction. Nearly 10 years ago
surveyors, geologists, engi-
neers and other technical
experts set-out by packhorse
to explore and blueprint the
area, so that the whole of the
problems' likely to be en-
countered would be known
beforehand to the experts who
were to plan and build the
scheme. As far as the average
person can see, nothing has
been left to chance. There is
no “trial-and-error” about the
building of the Snowy. As
one example of the authority’s
passion for exactitude, I was
shown at Tumut Pond reser-


voir, which will control the
flow from four rivers, the
spillway which has been
designed for meeting a flood
emergency that is expected to
arise only twice in a thousand
years!
The authority has built
hundreds of miles of roads
through previously inacces-
sible country, to enable men
and materials to be taken to
various parts of the job. It
has also laid-down several
airstrips from which a small
Beaver aircraft, known as the
“Snowgoose,” is used to fly
urgently - needed supplies to
distant parts of the area at
short notice. Another unique
feature of the authority’s
transport system is the Mighty
Antar, a motor road - train
capable of carrying 120 tons,
with a prime-mover at both
ends and loudspeaking tele-
phones by which the four
crew - members communicate
with each other. Visitors get
a thrill to see the monster
creeping along narrow, preci-
pitous roads ; but it can be
highly embarrassing to meet
it at a particularly narrow
point where the giant claims
the right-of-way regardless of
traffic regulations.
Visitors who tour the area
by coach are able to have
refreshments at the “Tea-
house of the August Moon,’’
a fascinating little building
overlooking Lake Eucumbene
which has been created by the
Adaminaby Dam, one of the
highest earth-and-rock-fill
dams in the world, with a 40ft.
width at the crest and half-
a-mile wide at the base. The
lake, which has been filling
for only 18 months, could
go on filling for many years
and will eventually hold eight
times the quantity of water
in Sydney Harbor. In a 12-
mile launch-trip across the
lake to the ghost-town of old
Adaminaby 1 passed over the
showground and racecourse
which 1 was assured were even
then covered by 40ft. of
water!
The transfer of a number
of buildings, including three
churches, from old Ada-
minaby to the new modern
town some miles away was a
triumph of organisation for
the authority. When buildings
were moved to the new town-
ship, some were redesigned,
and where structural delects
occurred, these were remedied.
A similar change will take
place in Jindabyne when the
lime comes to submerge that
town a few years hence. From
the veranda of the old-
fashioned hotel which still
serves iced beer to thirsty
travellers, I looked across at
a tiny church standing on a
hill in the highest part of the
town and was told that even-
tually it may be covered by
50ft. of water.
The authority has given the
N.S.W. Government a firm
assurance that it will prevent
the spread of soil-erosion from
its works, and a number of
ingenious methods are being
used to ensure this. To pre-
vent washaways where roads
have been cut out of the
mountainside a Finn Batter
stabilising machine is being
used to spray a mixture of
straw and asphalt on to the
road-batters to control
erosion. Seed and fertiliser
are then spread on the mulch ;
Looking down on Adaminaby Dam and Lake Eucumbene
building-up behind it. It will take years for the dam to fill.
When full it will hold eight times the quantity of water in
Sydney Harbor.
the asphalt protects the seed
and provides a good warm
seed-bed and perishes by the
time the seedlings are estab-
lished. In other parts trees
which have been felled are
allowed to lie on, the ground
to check the rush of water
down steep hillsides. The
effect is untidy, but I was
assured it is highly effective.
Guthega power-station, which is already feeding power into
the N.S.W. grid system.
Other interesting aspects:
The authority employs 5500
people of more than 30, dif-
ferent nationalities.
~ The specially-built town of
Cabramurra, which is larger
than the second town of
Island Bend, has a population
of 1300 and a roll-call of 200
at the local school run by the
N.S.W. Department of Educa-
tion.
All houses in the area are
insulated against extremes of
temperature ; water is free, but
electricity has to be paid for,
with a specially low rate for
the heavy consumption neces-
sary for heating during the
winter.
The biggest explosion ever
set-off in the area used 90 tons
of gelignite.
The largest powerhouse in
the scheme is about 700 ft.
long, 100 ft. high and 1000 ft.
underground.
The tyres on some of the
authority’s earth - moving
equipment are inflated with
a mixture of 75 per cent!,
water and the balance air, to
increase weight and improve
traction.
The longest tunnel will be
30 miles, with a diameter of
24ft.
The first contract for a
power project, the Guthega
station, was commenced in
August, 1951, and was com-
pleted in February, 1955, on
schedule ; the Adaminaby
project was completed in May,
1958, two years ahead of
schedule. The whole scheme
is expected to be completed
by 1975.
The authority maintains its
own security-service to patrol
the area.
My visit took-in the ancient
township of Kiandra, which
claims to have the oldest ski-
club in the world, formed in
1870, and is equally famous
for its trout-fishing. Guests
at the Chalet dine in the
former exercise-yard of the
old jail, and at night swap
stories of their exploits around
an open log-fire built in the
centre of the big lounge-room.
Kiandra was famous as a
goldmining centre 100 years
ago, and the ancient diggings
can still be seen on the hill-
sides surrounding the town-
ship. The population at one
stage ran into many thousands.
I was intrigued to learn that
it was Chinese coolies, with
picks and shovels, who solved
the water-supply problem for
the washing of gold. The
Chinese built a dam a few
miles out of the town and
carried the banked-up water
around the hillsides in aque-
ducts. Some of these aque-
ducts are still there, and 1 was
told that, on recent examina-
tion, they were found to be
working.

King Island Scheelite
TTith a big investment port-
folio as its only source of
income since depressed tung-
sten prices forced the suspen-
sion of mining activities at
King Island, last August, King
Island Scheelite (1947), Ltd.,
has agreed to finance the de-
velopment of areas under
option to Australian Gold De-
velopment, N.L., at Kainantu
in the central highlands of
New Guinea. A prospect on
the Maranboy (N.T.) tinfield,
investigated jointly with
United Uranium and Loloma
(Fiji) Gold Mines is now con-
sidered “unlikely” to prove of
interest to the co.
Drilling, underground de-
velopment and sampling to a
cost of £lO,OOO is to be carried
out at Kainantu within the
next year, and, if further work
is justified, an additional
£25,000 will be made available
in the following year. Should
' results warrant the formation
of a public co., King Island
will be entitled to a quarter of
any consideration received and
A.G.D. to the balance.
Meanwhile divs., etc., from
King Island’s investments are

proximately Bd. a ss. share an

PACTS AND FACTS
By “R.R.D.”
\l7hat have we got to put
* * against Communist imper-
ialism? The answer stands out
time and again—each time a
small nation, specially selected
for its isolated and inaccessible
position on the Communist
perimeter, is swallowed-up,
with the annihilation of its best
and bravest citizens. The
answer is blunt : nothing. We
can offer sympathy, of course,
and point to defence-pacts all
over the world, except there.
There’s a fulsome welcome for
refugees, but little means of
checking their tales of derring-
do; there’s a protest in the
U.N. —it’s an old story retold.
Then we wonder why the
uncommitted nations don’t
flock to our side.
It’s like watching a race,
when your fancy, left at the
start, chases the outsider but
is always a furlong behind.
You blame yourself for back-
ing a dud, blame the man who
gave you the tip and, if you’ve
ever worn silk yourself, blame
the jockey, too. It’s frustrating
in a horserace —and if you’ve
backed too exuberantly it’s
going to make a big difference
to your way of life. But you
can usually laugh it off, if you
are dealing only with horse-
racing. You’d look askance at
tipster and jockey in the future,
but recoup your losses by
applying the age-old rules of
successful betting. .
That’s all right for an ordin-
ary man of the world. But
nations, by the rule of psycho-
logy, act always on the impulse
of the lowest common denom-
inator, so cari’t go on backing
losers and expect to count them-
selves a force worth consider-
ing in the world. If a nation
loses its pride, it has lost every-
thing.
There’s something wrong with
the Western alliance. Evidently
they’ve got poor military in-
telligence and no mobile strik-
ing-force : but these are only
symptoms of a deeper-rooted
malady.
Have we got our x hearts in
the fight? That’s the crux of
the matter. We are all too keen
to do no more than look on
at the way the world is being
eaten-up in front of our eyes.
It’s a good lesson in geography,
but otherwise has no bearing
on our normal lives.
Billy Graham quotes a grim
forecast: “The West has, at
the most, two more years to
wake-up or blow-up.” The
ultimate truth of this statement
cannot be gainsaid, although
the precise arithmetic of the
matter is not so easy to cal-
culate. The fact is that we are
riding for a fall, and that will
come, as sure as God made
little apples, unless we are
prepared to change our tactics.
Our adversaries have a motive
force; unless we can produce
something equally dynamic, we
shall get nowhere.
As for Seato, we are told
that the military advisers left
their conference in New Zea-
land “alarmed” at the Chinese
invasion of Tibet. It’s in the
fashion —Nato and the U.N.
were alarmed and horrified by
the Hungarian massacres, and
the Baghdad Pact members
were alarmed and, if tales are
true, embarrassed by the coup
d’etat in Iraq.
We need something more
effective, then, than these pacts:
we want unity of council
among the nations; a policy
which faces facts with realism;
adequate means of gaining
information in time to act
swiftly and boldly; and a force
in being, immediately available
to deal with the enemy
wherever he chooses to go,
not just where we think he
might go.
CHANGING SEA-TRAVEL
By “LOOKOUT”
T} stablished passenger-liners
' are experiencing an un-
expected slump on the run from
Australia to the United King-
dom. Wealthy Australians
average a trip to Britain every
three years. Having already
been there three times since the
war, and with no outstanding
attractions in the Old Country
this year, they are finding
alternative holiday-resorts.
The fully air-conditioned
Italian and Dutch liners are
being well patronised, and the
smaller cargo-ships carrying a
limited number of passengers
are as popular as ever.
Of particular significance in
this category are the smart bub
small modern Dutch ships
visiting Australian ports in
increasing numbers. Many of
these were idle after the Dutch
were excluded from the In-
donesian coastal trades. Now
they seem to be prepared to
experiment on new trades, and
will go to hitherto remote
places in search of suitable
cargoes.
Besides advertising regular
twelve-week round-trips to
Indonesia, Malaya, Hong Kong
and Japan they are offering
alternative voyages to Ceylon,
India and Pakistan as well as
to South and East Africa via
Mauritius. They will also go
as far as Brazil, Argentina and
Uruguay if sufficient induce-
ment offers.
Replying to the foreign
challenge, the regular British
liners are being air-conditioned
and are including Singapore
and other interesting variations
in their usual United Kingdom
services. The newly established
Orient Pacific Line is making
a bid for the Australia-Orient
trade.
Meanwhile, overseas liners
are also allowed to carry
passengers between Australian
ports if suitable accommoda-
tion is not available on the
regular inter-State passenger-
liners. If accommodation is
available on the Australian
ships without private bath-
rooms the overseas ships can
book passengers in cabins with
bathrooms attached.
Withdrawal of the Duntroon
and Westralia means more of
this trade for the overseas
ships. And at present there is
no Australian passenger-vessel
running from the eastern States
to the West. With no plans
announced for the replacement
of the ageing Monowai and
Wanganella it seems likely that
Orient Pacific, with regular
sailings to and from America
via New Zealand, might soon
absorb the trans-Tasman
passenger-trade as well as the
inter-State.


A Night for 20 Francs
By NIALL BRENNAN
Habitat is important.
Take an Australian
mountain man and put
him in the north of
France, and he flounders about
inefficiently.
I had had a cold night in
the Auberge Jeunesse at Beau-
mont, my funds were low, the
weather was freezing and my
plans were obscure because my
intelligence was not working
as well as normally. I was
dressed for a cold that came
in the wind, for a land where
winter was boisterous, some-
times even sunny.
The sun can be brilliantly
hot in the Australian highlands
in winter and the reflection
off the snow can be scalding to
the skin. If you are moving, a
cotton or canvas shirt which
repels the stiff breeze is all you
need to wear —above the waist.
The winter of northern France
was not like that. My wind-
proofs w’ere useless because
there was no wind. If I did
not catch a train and get out
of this terrible land, I would
die quietly in some street.
At Beaumont’s gave, I argued
with the ticket-seller. Was
“F 635” merely 635 francs, or
7635 francs, and if it was, why
did the French in their
barbarism always place a
stroke through their sevens?
The difference between 635 and
7635 is considerable. It
affects a ,whole standard of*
living; and instead of being
able to afford a train-ticket to
Boulogne, I found that I had
exactly 21 francs left after pay-
ment of the larger figure.
You can live for weeks in
the Aust ilian bush without
money. Even now I rarely
handle cash. Credit solves
everything and by the time the
summons arrives, you can
usually write a cheque for some
of it. But you can’t do much
in the north of France with 21
francs. In London, poverty is
still a downright crime, but
even in France it is almost im-
possible on 21 francs to find
any place to sit ; you are liable
to be moved around if you
just stand ; and of course you
don’t eat. I’ve always tried to
be detached about the stuff; but
if you really want to do with-
out it, get out of Beaumont.
You need it there.
The train I boarded seemed
a poor thing to be called the
“Boulogne Rapide.” Two box-
cars and a tank engine, badly
heated and at times hardly
moving scarcely warranted so
pretentious a title ; but I didn’t
know. A passing ticket-
inspector muttered at me and
1 caught the word “changez
...” I caught it again in
response to my screech, but I
caught no other details. It
sounded like “cray” as in “fish.”
A change of trains was good to
look forward to, but it might
have to be done quickly. Not
knowing where, I kept my eye
open for trains in general.
As I slowly rotted to death
in the French boxcar, I began to
form some plans for my next
life. I had about £l4 sterling
in British travellers’ cheques,
but one couldn’t use these
France. I don’t know why. I
had an English 10s.-note which
was also immoral in France. I
had my precious 21 francs. If
1 could get to Boulogne, there
would be a ship for England
somewhere; and it would be
a solid British ship where they
accepted British money, and
spoke English. Jolly good! I
wished to leave France.
I sat in my box, shivered and
looked at a grey landscape ;
with a grey sky. Once in the
Victorian Alps during the
winter, I had leapt into a small
stream, sluiced myself, roared
healthily, and leapt out,
towelled madly and then eaten
a great steak for breakfast.
That is civilisation. Elere, 1
just had to sit. The tempera-
ture was the same. We rattled
and banged over a number of
in lines into a place called “Creil”
which seemed •as if it might
be Cray—as in “fish.” Any-
way, my boxcars were finished
for the day and a party of
mechanics were tightening
the mall up for the return
journey. So I got down and
asked halting questions.
Cure, the Boulogne Rapide
would be through : at ders
hers, 2 p.m., only two hours
to wait and very little to do
except wait.
I am a man of decision ;
years ,of adventuring in the
Australian Alps have helped
there ; so I waited. In the
mountain huts back home, we
warmed our fronts and then
our backs but we warmed them
in front of a blazing fire made
from snow-gum logs hauled in
from the blizzard. A fire that
you cannot approach within
six feet of is a good fire. You
can peel off your outside
clothes, and rollick in front,
of a fire like that, with your
belly full of good rich food,
chops and charcoal, sausages
and leaves, and you can talk
to the small group of com-
panions who are not only of
your own choosing but of your
own species. Such delights are
reserved * for the unmapped*
unexplored, marginal regions
of way-down-under Australia.
Less than 50 miles from the
Arc de Triomphe, and perched
on the periphery of all that
stands for European culture
and Christendom, you crouch
in a cave over a fire fashioned
by a Stone Age porter, and
snarl at anyone who comes too
close.
After several years, the
Boulogne Rapide came roar-
ing into the station. I had
expiated not only all my own
sins but those of other people
and, seeing release in sight,
lurched out into the air with
the nearest approach to hope
I had had for several hours.
I still hated the glory, the
grandeur and the generosity
that was France, and spat at
the thought of liberty, equalitv
and fraternity, especially if it
meant with the French. But
the Boulogne Rapide looked
efficient. It was all pipes,
pistons, headlights and steam.
But I was the only passenger
to board her at Cray, and the
whole train was vibrant with
impatience. I climbed the


steps to a waiting doorway,
opened the door and entered
the compartment. It was a
narrow door, and my rucksack,
spreading my width by another
foot on either side, refused to
follow me. I backed out the
door, down the ladder, reached
the ground and took off my
rucksack.
Holding the large pack in
one hand, slightly balanced on
my head, I mounted the ladder
again, using only one hand: a
difficult feat. Then I could
throw the rucksack into the
compartment, full of surly
Frenchmen. The rucksack lay
over the three sets of unyield-
ing legs, and not one of the
bastards helped me. An
Englishman buries himself in a
newspaper to avoid embarrass-
ing scenes in public ; but the
Frenchman just stares at them
stonily.
Bells clanged, porters
shouted, I dragged myself into
the compartment, stood on ail
the feet, accepted the mumbled
curses with a snarl of repartee
and fell into the. vacant corner
of a hard seat, wedged between
Gallic self-sufficiency on all
sides. I sank into an evil coma,
and don’t remember anything
until we reached Boulogne, six
hours later.
In the drab night-chill of
Boulogne station, a porter im-
patiently, and with no regard
for the enormity to me of what
to him seemed a trivial fact,
told me bluntly that there was
no batto for England that
night. No ship at all. No way
of escape from France, and
it was nightfall, many degrees
colder, for Boulogne is much
nearer the Arctic circle than
Paris.
I stood on the icy platform
in a state of near-panic and
announced in pure, clear Eng-
lish vowels what I thought of
France, its historic people, and
its role in world affairs. Travel
broadens the mind, they say.
True, my thoughts then were
more complex and subtle than
ever before at home. Problems
in the Alps were straight-out
problems, to be solved by men
of competence and experience.
Problems at Boulogne were the
sort that grew into a neurosis.
Nobody understood, nobody
noticed.
It was all very'busy, every-
body had some place to go,
presumably some access to a
roof and a fire and food for a
night that looked fit' 1 to crack
the seams of the skin with
frost. So for want of anything
better to do I climbed back
into the train. It was going
a few miles further up to
Calais. So far from anywhere
that mattered, nobody seemed
to worry about tickets. The
train was my only roof and it,
at least, was warm, and by
now almost empty.
It was not quite empty. As
I Slumped oh to the seat, think-
ing to myself: enjoy these soft
wooden seats and good stuffy
air, old man, because they
may be the last things you’ll
ever enjoy, a swarthy man
opposite stared at me. I stared
back and scowled. He stank
as of the unwashed, had a huge
suitcase, and his blue suit,
white shirt, and tie bore the
marks of one who has tried
hard to dress like a gentleman
but, not having the proportions
right, needs to try a lot harder.
He put out a tobacco-stained
finger, and touched my watch,
a massive geegaw of knobs and
dials I had bought in Port
Said; and he asked me in
French where I had bought
it.
I replied that I didn’t speak
French. I didn’t, either, for
conversation. My French w'as
laborious and nerve-wracking,
studded with such infinite
possibility for misunderstand-
ing that I kept what little I
had for raw essentials. He
replied in perfect English:
“Are you British, m’sieu?’’
I gaped ; and then grinned.
How little does it take to make
a friend? One step back from
the Tower of Babel and men
begin to love each other again.
In 10 minutes we knew all
about each other, were old
buddies. He was a profes-
sional blackmarketeer, run off
the docks at Bordeaux for
hiking American cigarettes off
ships; bound for Calais because
it was the port furthest in all
France from Bordeaux. He was
an Arab. His name was
Ahmid.
“But where do you plan to
stay the night?” he asked me.
I sniggered. That was the
big question which a flash
of hope had made me think
Ahmid might answer.
“I see,” he replied, thought-
fully. “Do you have twenty
francs?”
I boasted that I had more.
I had 21.
“Then,” he said, “I can get
you a bed for the night.”
TTe did, too. At Calais, by
the station, was a gaunt
iron shed with a fugitive flicker
of light from the window. It
was the Maison d’Acceuil, the
“House of Welfare,” one of
many which a benevolent
French Government builds by
the bigger railway-stations for
the greater comfort of the
(Continued on page 44)
Faith in the
Future
Life is a profound teacher. Every now and
then we see the figure of ourselves in others;
sense the problems that are theirs, and recognise
them as precisely our own.
In France a few months ago I walked in the
countryside and met farm workers, of whose
philosophy, founded in the good simplicities, I
have just been reminded by reading Maurice
Moyal’s “On the Road to Pastures New.”
The background of his story is that drought in
summer in the south of France forces farmers to
take their.sheep and goats up to feeding grounds
high in the Alps. Unless they make this yearly
march, the animals starve. Unless they return
home in October, they perish in the new snow.
He tells how he went with two thousand of
them that were led up from north-west of Marseilles
—a distance of two hundred miles broken into
fifteen-mile stages.
Travelling by night to avoid traffic, resting
at intervals to accustom the shorn animals to the
cold mountain weather, they made the journey
slowly, often painfully.
There were reliefs to its starkness and its
risk; the devotion of man to animal, and animal
to man; the sense of human achievement when
the grasses were sighted, and again when the sheep
were safely back home at the chill close of autumn.
In Australia the pastoral picture is different.
Our 150-million sheep are flocked on the plains.
Though drought is a shadow cast commonly on both
pictures, we have not here between livestock and
pastures the barriers of cold, precipitous height.
But in essence the story is the same. On
Alpine slopes, as in Australia, we see the necessity
for an identical striving against whatever problems
Nature may impose. That is true not only of the
tending of sheep, but of everything a nation in its
industrious life may seek to accomplish and protect.
And the force behind that striving is the Faith
of men determined to win through, so that they
and the things of their charge may go on and live
into every season.
H. Hastings Deening


Tbe Price of Development
Last week a sudden spate of warn-
ings came from various sources, all
to the general effect that this
country must be prepared for
further industrial expansion to meet the
needs of a growing population.
In a way, this was surprising. It might
have been thought that by now everyone
in Australia was aware of the necessity.
When even a Country-party Acting Prime
Minister can go on record as expressing
pleasure that Australia is no longer riding
on the sheep’s back, surely no one can
be ignorant of the importance of second-
ary industry in our economy.
The warnings really stemmed from a
fear that the industrial expansion of the
past ten years may have encouraged a
complacent belief that this growth will
continue without any conscious effort to
help it along.
At the opening of the Machine Tool
Exhibition which followed Billy Graham
at the Sydney Showground, Sir Eric
Woodward, Governor of N.S.W., spoke
of the changes implied in the coming of
automation and warned that Australia
could not afford to be odd-man-out in
accepting the latest techniques of mass-
production, without which “we cannot
maintain the present living-standards, let
alone improve them.”
On the same day, speaking in Mel-
bourne at the annual conference of the
Australian Industries Development
Association, of which he is president,
C. G. McGrath said that Australia must
not be satisfied with “gentle expansion.”
A higher rate of development was needed.
He warned against complacency and said
that many industries, far from experien-
cing even a gentle expansion were finding
the going very tough. In four years the
numbers in private employment had risen
only seven per cent., and in the 12 months
to February, 1959, by only 9700.
J. N. Kirby, chairman of the Manu-
facturing Industries Advisory Council
(set-up by the Federal Government), told
the same conference that his council had
reported to the Minister for Trade on the
main issues facing the manufacturing side
of the Australian economy in the next
ten years.
He said that in that period the manu-
facturing industries would have to expand
sufficiently to provide for the employment
of an additional 400,000 workers. To
make this expansion possible, he said,
favorable conditions would be needed,
“with an alert Government with policies
to help industries achieve it.” He thought
the help should come through tax-relief
and tariff-revisions ; a more liberal taxa-
tion-policy, especially with regard to
depreciation and investment-allowances,
would assist materially .
Although Government assistance of the
type suggested would encourage
Australian companies to expand their
plants and make it easier for them to
raise additional capital locally, it is very
doubtful if growth on the scale envisaged
is possible without the help of overseas
capital. Indeed, much of the expansion
of recent years would not have been
possible without the inflow of funds from
Britain and America, and Government
policy in every State is directed towards
persuading manufacturers in other
countries to establish branch factories in
Australia.
There has been criticism of the way
in which the State Premiers have been
competing with each other in the hunt for
new industries and a suggestion that a
Federal secretariat might do the job better.
This is very doubtful. A Federal body
could do no more than point-out the
advantages and disadvantages of the
different States. An overseas concern seek-
ing concessions would still have to
approach State Governments if it wanted
a concrete proposal.
Victorian Premier Bolte, who, in con-
junction with his “Promote Victoria”
committee, has been responsible for
enticing, inveigling or persuading a swarm
of U.S. industrialists to try their luck in
Victoria, is at present on another pro-
motion tour of the United States and
Canada. Last week, at a luncheon in
Chicago, he told a gathering of business-
men that U.S. companies were investing
in Australia at the rate of £43 million
annually, and that American companies
were earning an average of 13 per cent,
on their capital invested in Australia.
r "T'HOSE figures are likely to interest U.S.
A concerns looking for overseas fields of
investment, and at the present time there
are many in this category. However, Mr.
Bolte’s mention of the high earning-rate of
U.S. capital in Australia raises a point
which has occasioned much bitter argu-
ment in the last two or three years.
The large sums paid in dividends to its
American parent - company by General
Motors-Holden’s have provoked not only
uninformed criticism amounting almost to
abuse of the “We’re-being-robbed”
category ; they have also led more respon-
sible people to wonder whether develop-
ment bought with foreign capital is really
worth while.
Such reasoning looks at only one side
of the question. It sees the dividends
going out of the country and ignores the
fact that without the original investment
money would still be going out to pay for
imported cars. More important still, it
ignores the huge wages-bill paid to Aus-
tralian workmen and the large sums paid-
out for Australian materials.
It ignores, too, the undoubted influence
of the Australian-made Holden in need-
ling other car-manufacturers into estab-
lishing factories in Australia or increasing
the Australian component in their
vehicles.
HThe habit of inviting foreign capital into
the country and then seeming to
resent its making a profit is not peculiar
to Australia. The South American
republics gladly welcomed British and
European capital to develop their rail-
ways, tramways and other public utilities,
but there came the day when most of
them were expropriated and nationalised.
British capital financed much of the
industrial expansion of the United States
during the second half of last century, but
during the two World Wars U.S. indus-
trialists gladly relieved Britain of all its
U.S. investments in payment for munit-
ions.
The tendency is, in fact, universal, and
America is coming up against it now as
Britain did in the past.
Even in England, where something like
£lOOO million of U.S. money is invested
in British industry, fears are being
expressed as to the consequences, the
latest evidence of this being questions
asked in the Commons regarding
American take-over bids for British firms.
Replying to this, a writer in the London
“Financial Times” asks pertinently what
would be the attitude of British critics if
U.S. capital bypassed Britain and went
straight behind the tariff-walls of the
Common Market instead. He maintains
that any country should be thankful for
the capital and technical knowledge
immigrant capital brings.
A side of the picture not usually consid-
ered by recipient countries is the effect
on the home front in the creditor-country.
The U.S. Department of Commerce has
been inquiring into the foreign activities
of American companies, and the “U.S.
News and World Report” recently
tioned that there is a growing fear that in
exporting capital America is also export-
ing the jobs of its own workers. A
Wisconsin Senator who wants a Senate
investigation of American investment
abroad claims that in the case of one
company in his State “the 40 per cent, of
production that used to go into export is
now produced in a foreign factory with
a loss of more than 2000 Wisconsin jobs.”
Regardless of ethics and of the lack of
logic in the double-standard approach to
this subject, it seems likely that Australia,
like other capital-hungry countries, will
continue to seek investments from abroad,
and that some Australians wilj continue
to resent the profit on this capital going
out of the country.
As in most human problems, the ulti-
mate solution probably lies in com-
promise, most likely along lines already
developing. Last wd!ek the U.S. Embassy
in Canberra issued a review of American
investment in Australia in which it was
stated that in the first three months of
this year eight U.S. companies entered
into agreements which gave Australian
capital a degree of joint-ownership of
their Australian plants.

Brisbane Handicaps
The Q.T.C. handicapper has
allotted what appear flattering
weights to several top gallopers
in the club’s £lO,OOO Strad-
broke Handicap, to be run
over seven furlongs on June
13. However, Brisbane officials
have a habit of doing this, and
it has the advantage of en-
couraging the appearance of
the best horses from other
States and from New Zealand.
Certainly in his best form
Tulloch’s 10.4 would not be
excessive in the Stradbroke—
he was weighted at 10.1 for the
two-mile Melbourne Cup.
Gold Stakes won the Oakleigh
Plate v/ith 9.2 and the New-
market Handicap with 9.6, and
his 9.5 seems a handy weight.
His fourth with 9.4 to Tudor
Hill in the Doncaster was also
a splendid effort, and Tudor
Hill has advanced from 8.11
to 9.2. Tulloch is topweight,
with 10.1, in the £12,000 two-
mile Brisbane Cup two days
after the Stradbroke.
Grey Ghost appears to have
his full share with 8.13 in the
Stradbroke, especially when
compared with Gay Port,
whose 8.4 is an open invitation
for owner-trainer Leo O’Sulli-
van to take the gelding north.
In view of his stylish win at
Rosehill with 8.9 last Saturday,
Gay Port, fit and well on the
day —he isn’t easy to train —
will take a lot of beating with
what looks, for such a fine
sprinter, a luxury weight.
Huntly finished fourth to
Gay Port at Rosehill, coming
from the tail of the field. He
carried 9.7, and drops to 9.2
in the Stradbroke. It was his
second run since a spell, and
he could win a sprint before
going north. Seven Stradbroke
horses have weight above 8.13.
The rest of the entrants —100
of them—range down from
8.10 to the limit, 7st.
Different riding - tactics
brought £976 prizemoney and
the £lOO trophy to the owners
of New Zealander Royal
Jester in the Rosehill Lord
Mayor’s Cup. The four-year-
old —raced by E. F. and Mrs.
Allison and trained by T. W.
Green—had been getting too
far back in races, and it was
decided to keep him nearer the
leaders over the Rosehill 10
furlongs. Thus ridden, he
made a smart move round the
home-turn and caught the
favorite, Flash Gem, near the
winning-post. It was his second
Sydney win, the other being
at Randwick late in March.
Brisbane Cup horses Ark
Royal and Foxmara competed
in Royal Jester’s race, and will
be all the better for the run.
The same applies to Baystone,
who competed in Gay Port's
Civic Handicap, in which
sprint also Compass drew
“Thank heavens it's daylight. Gee, Molly, I've just had
a TERRIBLE nightmare!"
attention to probable early
winning prospects by a strong
finishing run into second place.
Eagle Farm two-year-old
winners Ton (Nursery) and
Greenwood (Juvenile) last
Saturday are both Queensland-
bred youngsters. Ton cleared
out with her race, but Green-
wood just managed to score by
a short head. Ton, a daughter
of Melbourne Cup winner Dal-
ray, is from Chez Dior by
Maytown from Mary’s Robe
by High Force (imp.). Green-
wood is by Jungle King (imp.)
from Colark. His relatives have
included Battledress (N.Z.
Derby), Variant (N.Z. Oaks)
and Nizam’s Ring (V.R.C.
Oaks).
• • • •
Brisbanites are hopeful that
Earlwood, a smart sprinter and
winner of the Q.T.C. Flying
at the latest fixture, will prove
a worthy Stradbroke contender.
He won at Eagle Farm carry-
ing 8.7, and has 8.1 in the
Stradbroke, which, however,
seems rather close to Gay
Port’s 8.4. Still, the Q.T.C.
handicapper must have a good
opinion of the local three-year-
old, who is by Boxwood (imp.)
from Honey Buzz by The
Buzzard (imp.).
Grey colt Martello Towers,
with two successive wins, gives
promise of being one of
Sydney’s best three-year-old
sprinters in the coming season,
judging by his effortless but
convincing victory in the Rose-
hill Two-year-old Handicap, in
a limit-field of 22 runners. His
trainer, E. D. Lawson, has now
won 10 races with his two-year-
olds, his other winners being
Carrus, Panessa, Parabola,
Doubtless and Akimbo. Mar-
tello Towers ran the six fur-
longs in close to race-record
time.
Writer has watched 16-year-
old apprentice Peter Miers rid-
ing trackwork at Rosebery
since the lad became attached
to the stables of trainer Kel
Suttle, and it wasn’t so sur-
prising to see his already good
riding land 33-to-l chance
Bystander a winner in the
10-furlongs Auburn Stakes at
the Hill. Miers had Bystander
in front soon after the start,
hugged the rails for the rest of
the trip, and, though he looked
beaten in the final furlong, got
another effort out of his mount
for a stylish win.
Apprentice Fred Hodder,
who won the First Parramatta
Stakes on Nearest, is another
promising young horseman.
Nearest now goes into open
company, and should soon
score in a Welter.
Globous, winner of the
Second Parramatta Stakes, is a
three - year - old Globetrotter
(imp.) gelding bred at Hobart-
ville Stud, Richmond
(N.S.W.).' He’s from the Fel-
crag (imp.) mare Felbina.
Sunya (third to Globous) was
hampered in the run home,
and looked a bit unlucky.
• • • •
Idle Fancy, one of veteran
New Zealand trainer Doug
Webster’s team, had nothing
to recommend him for the
Welter at Rosehill —in his two
previous Sydney. outings he
hadn’t been closer than ninth
—but he won well. In the ruck
most of the way, he dashed
through very strongly in the
final furlong.
A particular feature of the
mid-week Canterbury Park
meeting was the fine riding by
Ray Selkrig, whose four wins
took him to the lead in the Syd-
ney jockeys’ premiership. He
was one ahead of Sellwood
when racing concluded (57
firsts). There’s still time for
Sellwood to make it tough for
the young lightweight, as he
expects to resume riding before
the end of the month (after the
race-fall which has kept him
out of the saddle).
• • •
Selkrig’s winners included
the T. J. Smith-trained Easter
Fair in the Second Maiden
Handicap. Easter Fair (a three-
year-old gelding raced by New
Zealander W. S. Goosman) is
by Fair’s Fair (imp.) from Re-
velate by Revelation (imp.).
Horses drawn on the inside
win most races from the 74-
furlongs barrier at Canterbury
Park, and Regalian added her
name to the list in the First
Maiden. A smart three-year-
old filly, she was bred and is
raced and trained by S. C.
Weber, and is by Rego
(imp.) for Princess Marco
by Coronation Day (imp.) from
Margarita by Medieval Knight
(imp.).
In the Lakemba Handicap
(fillies and mares) at the same
meeting Kaoru cleared-out to
win in race-record time, 1.11.7
for the six furlongs. Turkis
Don also ran a race-record in
the Novice.

At Moonee Valley
This could be one of the
best seasons in Hurdle and
Steeple racing that Melbourne
has known for years, particu-
larly the fencing side of the
game. There is every chance

that Pedro’s Pride will be fit
again, and two steeplechasers
are already being spoken of
as prospective National win-
ners Tranquil Glow and
Roadbourne. At the Valley
last Saturday, Roadbourne
gave an impressive display to
win the Melrose Steeple from
end to end. The aged Ford
Transport gelding ran the two
miles in 3.42 f, cutting 1 / lOsec.
from the record he had estab-
lished himself the previous
Saturday.
• • • •
Like Tranquil Glow, Road-
bourne likes to run his races
at a fast clip, and give the
others the task of running him
down. In the longer races
to come, leading up to the
National, it will be interesting
to see if these two dashing
jumpers can defy the strong
finishing efforts of the solid
type of fencer.
• • • •
Old Van Perri ran unplaced
in the Melrose Steeple. The
Valley specialist is not within
cooee of his top form, but
owner Reg Ansett is keeping
him going in the hope that he
will set an all-time stake-
winning record. He needs only
£2OO.
Whether Reticule, winner of
the Plenty Hurdle, is a National
chance might depend on a con-
tinuation of the freakish dry
spell in Melbourne; the six-
year-old Great Britain gelding
won’t do his best on wet tracks.
Should he strike conditions to
his liking, Reticule could be a
National chance. He showed
the requisite stamina over the
2 miles and 1 furlong, gaining
20 lengths on the leaders over
the last half-mile, and going
away for an easy win.
Winning a six - furlongs’
sprint at the Valley is not the
soundest basis for suggesting
that a horse is a Derby pros-
pect, but owner Dave White-
side has hopes that his two-
year-old Feathertop might be
classic material. The gelding
has raced only five times for
three wins, none of them
admittedly in top company.
By High Peak from Gaysonox,
a half-sister to former Adelaide
gallopers Wellock and Demp-
sey, Feathertop impressively
won the first L a 1 u m a
Handicap.
Woambra, winner of the
second Laluma, is out of Sig-
nify by N.Z. sire Faux Tirage,
who gets an interesting mixture
of sta'yers and sprinters —
Knave, V.R.C. Sires’ Produce
Stakes winner, and Straight
Draw, Melbourne Cup winner,
for example. Which way
Woambra will develop is not
easy to say, but going on his
easy win at the Valley he will
score in better races.
Gay Titian, winner of the
third Laluma, is a gelding by
Smokey Eyes from Dizzy
Dame. One to watch from
this field is Officedale, who
finished with great dash and
would have caught the winner
in a few more strides. Office-
dale is N.Z.-bred, and his sire,
Fair’s Fair, has got some good
distance - horses, including
Somerset Fair, winner of the
A.R.C. Great Northern Derby,
and Gulliver, runner-up in the
N.Z. Derby and Great North-
ern Derby. Over a bit of
ground, Officedale may be
more than useful.
A distance race is the
soundest test of a jockey’s
ability, with tactics and judg-
ment of pace both important,
and in the Valley’s 13-furlongs’
Empire Handicap experienced
Frank Treen gave the younger
lads a lesson with his handling
of the winner, Uncle Mac,
keeping him going kindly on
the rails, always in touch with
the leaders, until the straight
entrance, where the Mac-
Arthur gelding showed the
benefit of his calm handling by
bounding away to win very
easily. The MacArthur stock
stay like bailiffs, as did the
progeny of MacArthur’s own
sire, Marconigram, who got
Melbourne Cup winners Mara-
bou and Skipton, and it is likely
that Uncle Mac will continue
to win his share of distance
events.
Apropos of the MacArthur
stock, that sire’s son Mac won
the two-miles Adelaide Cup
last Wednesday. As far as
present writer was concerned,
it was a case of first thoughts
best; it was suggested here a
couple of weeks back that Mac
would win the race, but Gay-
bao’s good form influenced the
ultimate choice of him as the
winner. Actually, Gaybao
started a 5-to-4 favorite and
ran a dreadful race. Mac, an
11-to-2 chance, won easily—
the eighth Victorian - trained
horse to win the Cup in the
last 11 years.

The Trots
Favorite at 5 to 2 on, Best
Ever, with a commanding lead
entering the straight, weakened
and lost to Riverina pacer Hot
Spell in the N.S.W. Oaks at
Harold Park on Saturday night.
Taking Best Ever to the lead
and setting the pace after the
first lap, Caffyn looked a cer-
tain winner when he shot the
filly away to a five-lengths’
lead, but he just beat New
Zealander Wendy Charles by a
nose for second money.
Caffyn had previously won
both Qualifying Stakes and
had equalled Alf Phillis’s
record of 41 wins in a season.
He beat that record when he
drove Kerryfield to victory in
the Harold Park Handicap,
upsetting 6-to-4-on favorite
Dark Rebel. The fast pace in
the middle stages helped Kerry-
field to run a race record,
carving out the 13fur. and
98yds. in 3.38, lfsec. faster
than First Kiss’s record estab-
lished in October last year.

Other Sports
The V.F.L. “four” after four
rounds is Carlton and North
(the only two unbeaten teams),
Melbourne and Hawthorn,
with South level on match-
points with the latter pair. On
Saturday South’s winning run
came to an end on narrow
Glenferrie Oval, with Haw-
thorn on top throughout in a
fast, open game, 19.14-13.19 ;
Hawks’ ruckman-forward Peck
kicked eight goals. North
toppled Essendon at Essendon,
11.11-8.14, Carlton was far too
fast for Richmond 14.17-9.7,
Melbourne crushed Footscray
19.17-9.12, while St. Kilda gave
Collingwood its fourth drub-
bing despite a gallant last-
quarter effort by ’Wood, 12.19-
8.16. Geelong, young and fast
and beginning to look more
like a team, somewhat surpris-
ingly beat Fitzroy 13.12-12.8.
West Adelaide, which was
beaten > by two points by Port
in last year’s S.A.N.F.L. grand-
final, is the only unbeaten team.
this year after four rounds.
On Saturday it easily beat
South 15.16-7.13. Port, like
V.F.L. premier Collingwood,
was surprisingly beaten in the
opening round (by West, by
four points), but Adelaide’s
Magpies, unlike the Melbourne
variety of the species, have
since kicked on to three con-
vincing wins. Norwood is the
only Adelaide team yet to win.

In Saturday’s match-of-the-

bably faster right-winger Barry
Truran’s 75yds. dash, outpacing
both opposing wingers, to score
under the posts. In an exciting
game University just held-off

St. George beat East 14-6, and

Sydney Rugby League’s
match-of-the-day was a thrill-

reduced to a 15-12 lead at the
interval, after a burst by
West which yielded two tries.
It was 21-all 7min. from the
end, but West finished-off with
a penalty-goal by Russell and
a try by Test forward O’Shea.
St. George, though scoring four
tries to nil, was flat-out to beat
Manly 18-8, with Manly carry-
ing a virtual “passenger” for
the whole game, when five-
eighth Quinnell was injured
soon after the start. In the
other games Parramatta scored
its second win of the season,

At Sydney Sports Ground
on Saturday, in a display of
classy Soccer, the Federation
team outplayed the Costa
Rican club Deportivo Saprissa 4-2.
Billed only as the “Federation,” the
local side was chosen from the
squad selected some time ago to
play Deportivo, and has had a
thorough preparation together
beforehand —a change from the
usual policy in selecting rep. teams
here.
This was the first Soccer game
in Sydney in recent years against
an overseas club in which the local
team has won, or has even looked
to be on an equal footing.
The Federation team, led by
Austrian international Baumgartner,
consisted of four Australian-born
players, an Englishman, an Irish-
man, a Scots international, three
Austrian internationals and a Hun-
garian. Two of the Austrians and

the Hungarian. Saghi, toured Aus-
tralia in 1957 with FK Austria.
The Federation’s first goal came
after 7min., when Baumgartner
goaled from a neat pass by Saghi.
Saghi scored the second goal, a
brilliant solo effort, and the third
was a neat header by outside-lelt
Salisbury, who had come into the
side when young German left-halt
Scheinflug had had to withdraw
through ’flu. _
Deportivo scored its first goal
lOmin. after the interval, when
goalie Lord, who did very well (as
did the Federation defenders as a
whole), stopped a hard shot but
not cleanly, and the ball, rolling
away, was nudged in by centre-
forward Rojas. Its second goal
came 20min. later still, kicked by
inside-right Rodriguez, who, in the
last minute or so and with all the
time in the world, kicked wide of
an open goal. However, by that
time the Federation had the game
won with the best goal of the match,
by Baumgartner, after a neat pass-
ing rush v/ith Saghi. The Federa-
tion finished with 10 men, the
Austrian inside-right Tamandl
having had to go off with injury.
On Sunday, at Bulli, Deportivo
overran South Coast 5-1.
In Brisbane on Saturday Heart of
Midlothian thrashed Australia 7-1,
the same margin by which it had
won in Sydney. Australia, consist-
ing of players from four States, held
the Scotsmen to 2-1 at half-time,
but wilted thereafter.

“Veryl” : There’ve been some
nasty incidents in Soccer games
all over Australia in recent
years, involving both players
and spectators. One suggestion
I’ve seen is that national teams
be broken-up and teams based
instead on residential areas, as
in other sports. Seems a good
idea. Newcomers to Australia
should learn to play alongside
British-descended Australians
as well as Australians of all
origins, not only of their own
nationality. Of course, there
might still be fights at games if
this idea were adopted—they’re
not unknown in codes where
there are no “national” teams.

With the Australian Dayis
Cup vista looking a trifle
unfurnished at the moment, it
was encouraging to sight at
least one very likely-looking bit
of material in the N.S.W. Lawn
Tennis Age Championships at
White City, Sydney, last week.
Hailing from the Northern
Suburbs area, John Newcombe
won the under-15 boys’ singles,
beating J. Cotterill 6-1, 6-1, and
then teamed with R. Brien to
win the under-15 doubles 6-3,
6-0. A fourteen-year-old just
nudging fifteen, Newcombe has
room for a lot of development
ahead of him both physically
and in his game, and in both
departments he has the right
framework on which to build.
With a ton of growing to do
yet, he’s already just under 6ft.,
scales comfortably over list,
and sports the frame of a
powerfully broad pair of
shoulders. What impresses
most about his game is that he
shows both room for, and
capability of, improving.
Round any suburban courts
these days one can see dozens
of youngsters who can send
down a dazzling serve and hit
the occasional bullet-like drive.
Most of them, though, play
without any real aim or pur-
pose other than bashing the
ball back, and are already as
good as they’re ever likely to
“There Was a strong undertow at Bondi”
fce Young Newcombe gives
an impression of never
being content merely to hit
the ball back ; he always hits
it with deliberate purpose. To
date, including Saturday’s two
wins* Newcombe has won some
11 State Age Championships,
including, at 14 years of age,
the Tasmanian under-19 title.

“Sutha”: Two tries were
scored at the one time by St.
Columban’s recently in its
Rugby game against Nudgee
Junior College at Indooroopilly
(Q.). While St. C.’s half waited
expectantly for his forwards to
win a ruck, a bail kicked acci-
dentally on to the field bounced
up in front of him. Unaware
that the ball was not the one in
play, he gathered it up, and
sent his backs away, the move-
ment ending with the Saints
scoring. Meanwhile the for-
wards battled on for the other
ball. In a sterling tussle they
were able to force Nudgee
over the line to score in the
opposite corner. The forwards’
try was ruled legal.

Victorian Chris Bell, now

The pioneer of this island-to-
mainland marathon was Doug-
las Pitt, who in 1924 accom-
plished the feat without
any great local excitement. Bell
swam the distance in a record
1 hour 54-j min. This year the
swimmers included a 19-year-
old Ayr waitress, Dulcie

make the crossing this hard
way.

solemnly reported, they bowled
unchanged . . . Next day, play-

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
RUSSIA'S TRADE-UNIONS
53-million of Russia’s
55-million workers are
trade-unionists. But does their
social influence correspond in
any way to their numerical
strength? Or are they still, as
in the Stalin era, merely,a part
of the Administration?
The 12th congress of Soviet
trade-unions, held in March in
the Kremlin, prompted London
“Economist” to ask these
questions; to note that the
congress gave no answer to
them ; and to take a look at
present trade-union conditions
in Russia:
“Questions about the chang-
ing role of the unions in a
changing society began to be
asked last May after the intro-
duction of two measures aimed
at instilling some life into the
practically moribund local
union organisations. Through
these reforms the powers of
the factory or shop committees
—the lowest branches of trade-
unions—in the management of
their enterprises were greatly
increased, at least nominally.
“The committees are now
supposed to have more say, not
only in the production-plan and
its fulfilment, but also in the
running of the firm and the
computation of wages. Offi-
cially, their agreement is
needled for the introduction of
overtime, the sacking of an
employee, the distribution of
bonuses, or the allocation of
housing accommodation.
Decentralisation
“The reforms are in keeping
with the economic decentralisa-
tion introduced by Mr.
Khrushchev. As long as direct
control from Moscow was the
rule, local initiative was rela-
tively unimportant. But the
complexity of a highly diversi-
fied modern economy, which
drove the Government to
divide the country into eco-
nomic areas with their own
regional councils, compelled it
at the same time to make
greater efforts to harness local
initiative.
“The granting of increased
powers to union branches was
thus dictated not by abstract
considerations of democracy
but by the search for greater
efficiency in a less centralised
framework. Naturally, too
much importance should not
be attached to paper changes
alone. Factory committees
existed as relics of the revolu-
tion, even under Stalin ; but
their function, like that of the
whole trade-union movement,
was turned inside-out.
“After the revolution the
membership of the unions was
only just over a million ; now'
it is nearly 53 million. But
members are not all. In Stalin’s
London “Evening Standard.”
“WELL? I’LL BE BLOWED IF I CAN SEE WHY WE
CAN’T TALK AT TOP LEVEL BEFORE YOU GET DOWN
TO THE SUMMIT!”
time the unions were used as
mere tools in the drive for
higher production. When the
time came to restore the
country’s economy after the
ravages of war and civil war
the managers had to be given
increased power as well as
responsibility. The military
principle of unified command
was applied to the management
of industry, and in the period
of rapid industrialisation, when
millions of raw peasants flocked
into the towns, it was applied
with military discipline. In
principle the party and trade-
union representatives in the
factory could act as a check on
the manager. In practice they
could not.
“With production and wage-
levels dictated strictly from
above by the planners, man-
agements and. trade-unions
worked together to apply the
disciplines and the incentives
needed to extract/increased out-
put from a raw labor-force.
The margins were so narrow
that the system left no scope
for collective bargaining.
“Thus, on one hand, the
unions were the allies of
management, advertising labor
‘norms’ and prompting ‘emula-
tion’ among workers. On the
other they acted as welfare-
societies, watching over safety-
regulations, distributing the
funds of social insurance and,
during the period of the great
migrations, recruiting rural
labor and helping in its assimi-
lation.
“The peculiar functions of
the unions are the outcome of
political decisions and not of
any structural atrophy. The
unions are organised vertically
by trade and, since 1948, they
have also horizontal links
through town, regional and
provincial councils. The ladder
runs from the shop and fac-
tory committee up to the All-
Union Council. In theory, ‘all
trade-union bodies from
bottom to top are elected by
the members .... and are
accountable to them.’ In prac-
tice, as in the party, the chain
of command runs only down-
ward.
“Thus, to obtain a measure
of greater democracy, what is
required is not a change in the
statutes but a change in their
application, causing the elect-
ed members to represent
the views of their electors
and to defend them at all
levels: in the factories, in the
regional economic councils
and, at the very top, in the
central planning-board.
No Sudden Change
“The idea that such a revo-
lutionary change might happen
suddenly can be ruled out. But
steps in this direction are not
unlikely because of changes
which have taken place since
Stalin's day. In the last few
years real wages have gone up
substantially. Technological
change and the growth of the
national income have given the
planners more room for
manoeuvre. The Government
has been able to reduce the
hours of labor ; and a 35-hour
working-week is the official aim
for the late 1960’5.
“But the biggest change has
probably been in the human
element. Gone are the days of
unlettered peasants come to
town. For some time now, all
the new recruits to the labor-
force have first completed
seven years at school ; many
workers of urban origin have
been at school for 10 years
or even more.
“The spreading of education,
and consequently of skill, has
compelled the authorities to
level-off the highly differen-
tiated scale of wage-norms, be-
cause the proportion of
workers reaching the higher
brackets was so large as to
make the system too costly.
Sporadic efforts to resurrect
Stakhanovism have not been
successful. Above all, the
social and educational gap be-
tween workers and manage-
ment has narrowed consider-
ably. Conditions may have
seemed ripe for a partial re-
vival of traditional trade-union
activity.
“A social transformation on
this scale will not take place
smoothly or at one go. Though
wage-differentials have some-
what decreased, the slogan of
equality of pay the once-
famous uravnilovka —remains
heretical, and piece-rates are
still the rule. And yet mechani-
cal advance and the introduc-
tion of automation give
strength to the inarticulate
pressure for weekly wages not
based on piece-rates.

“Dual Allegiance” te
“In a one-party dictatorship,
and when the State is the uni-
versal owner, the trade-unions
cannot perform the classical
trade-union function of repre-
senting their members’ interests
against the owners’ interests.
Communists will argue that this
dilemma will disappear to-
gether with the ‘Withering-
away of the State.’ In the
meantime the unions have to
strike a balance in their dual
allegiance.
“Their 12th congress has
confirmed that the trade-union
bosses have no intention of
giving-in easily to any pres-
sures for greater equality or
democracy. At the same time
they continue to deplore the
workers' failure to take a suffi-
cient interest in the production
conferences of the factories or
the union activities of their
branch ; and there are signs
that the search for labor co-
operation is gradually inducing
them to concede to labor a
slightly greater say in union
affairs. Planners, with wider
margins to play with, may
allow trade-unions a limited
bargaining-power. The unions
may be given some real say
in management, the elaboration
of plans- and the distribution of
resources.
“The process will not go
through without friction, but it
is worth watching for its signi-
ficance for the future of Soviet
society.”
Japanese Cloth
/Complaints about the sharp
practices of certain
Japanese manufacturers are
nothing new, though the
Japanese Government and. the
more reputable sections of
industry have done their best
in recent years to enforce a
higher standard of business
ethics. The latest instance con-
cerns the marking of Japanese
cloth. It is noted by the “Wool
Record”:
“The complaint is that
Japanese wool cloth is being
sold in export markets with
woven selvedges bearing in-
scriptions in English which
tend to deceive buyers and con-
sumers into thinking that they
are getting British cloth. Con-
sumers are particularly liable to
be deceived by these practices
in non-English-speaking coun-
tries, e.g., Venezuela and
markets in the Middle East.
“The International Code of
Fair Trading, in describing
wool-textiles, adopted by the
International Wool Textile Or-
ganisation. to which the wool-
textile industries of 21 coun-
tries (including Japan) belong,
provides that a manufacturer
or trader when marking or de-
scribing the goods he is offer-
ing may do so in a language
other than the language of the
country of origin, provided that
when so marking or describing
the goods he indicates with
equal emphasfs and prominence
the name of the country in
which they have been made,
preceded by the words ‘made
in . . .’
“The Japanese reply to the
complaint is expected before
the end of May, 1959. In the
Peace Treaty signed by Japan
with 47 nations, including the
U.K., in San Francisco in
September, 1951, the Japanese
Government, undertook ‘in
public and private trade and
commerce to conform to inter-
nationally accepted fair prac-
tices.’
“Japanese traders are anxious
to use the English language.
They claim that it is the
language of commerce and that
their customers would not
understand inscriptions in the
Japanese language. . ‘lf, how-
ever, they are ou) to promote
understanding, it is odd that
they should use the English
language for marking their
cloths in a Spanish-speaking
country like Venezuela, or in
places like Iran,’ say British
exporters.
“The words ‘with equal
emphasis and prominence’
mean ( a ) that the words ‘Made
in Japan’ cannot be added in
miniscule print and ( b) that if
an inscription such as ‘guaran-
teed all pure wool’ is used every
10 inches along the cloth, then
the words ‘Made in Japan’
must also appear every 10
inches.
“The Japan Spinners and
Importers’ Association, the
country’s main wool-textile
organisation, joined the
1.W.T.0. in 1953, and thereby
subscribed to the Code of
Fair Trading. In November,
1958, when an important
Japanese trade-mission, led by
Mr. Kureo Sasabe, president of
the Nagoya Chamber of Com-
merce, visited Bradford, it was
informed of the British wool-
textile industry’s concern over
Japanese non-observance of the
code. The Japanese mission
promised that the matter
would be looked into in Japan.
“But, according to a news-
agency report some weeks ago,
Japanese wool-spinners and
-exporters are opposed to pro-
posals that all Japanese wool-
fabrics for export should be
marked ‘Made in Japan.’
“The report added: ‘A pro-
posal to this effect was made
recently by the International
Wool Textile Organisation, of
which Japan is a member. The
spokesman said there had been
many cases where foreign im-
porters had specifically asked
that the country of origin
should, not be shown. The asso-
ciation would decide upon its
answer to the proposal before
the international Wool Textile
Organisation’s annual confer-
ence in June.’. ”
China's New Chief
Two editorial comments on
the appointment of Liu
Shao-chi as China’s new Head
of State:
“Manchester Guardian”: “He
[Liu] lacks Mao’s popular
touch and Chou En-lai’s
affability; one suspects that
the Chinese both his col-
leagues and the ordinary
people at best respect and
fear rather than like him. The
outside world has always
blamed him for the tougher
policies of the collective leader-
ship. He is usually believed, for
instance, to have opposed
Mao’s permission for flowers to
bloom and to have gained in
authority when, as he foresaw,
‘poisonous weeds’ sprang up.
He seems, indeed, to come
closest to Stalin in character
and policy among the Chinese
leaders.
“But he is not in supreme
command yet. The Chairman-
ship of the Republic to which
he has succeeded is an office
with real authority—it means
much more, for instance, than
the Presidency of the Soviet
Union. But the highest power
rests with the party-machine
rather than the organs of the
State, and it is therefore still
wielded by Mao.
“Moreover, Chou remains
Prime Minister. He is credited
with having sought to mitigate
some of the more enthusiastic
policies of the theorists (of
whom the retiring and the
new Chairmen of the Republic
are the most eminent); for
instance, the check to over-
ambitious plans for the peopled
communes is said to have


owed much to him. If there is,
indeed, tension between him
and Liu, it will presumably
continue so long as Mao is
there to hold the balance ;
after that the tug-of-war may
end with the victory of one of
the contestants. The destinies
of China, in fact, are now in
the hands of a triumvirate, and
triumvirates, in history, have
usually proved the least stable
form of leadership.”
* * it
London “Economist”: “Like
Mao Tse-tung, Liu was born
in Hunan province, the ‘cradle
of revolutionaries,’ the son of
a fairly well-to-do peasant
family. The characters of the
two men are in complete con-
trast. Mao’s creative, artistic
temperament can often make
men like him ; Liu’s calculat-
ing, bureaucratic mind and his
subtle dogmatism have never
been known to inspire more
than respect.
“In their youth they came to
see Marxism not only as a
method by which China could
be made modern and strong,
but also as an instrument of
national revolt against foreign
domination. Nevertheless their
paths soon diverged: while
Mao was .building China’s own
brand of peasant Communism
in the nineteen-twenties and
early ’thirties, Liu spread a
more orthodox gospel among
the people of the towns.
“At 25 he became vice-chair-
man of the Communist trade-
union congress ; after the sup-
pression of the urban Com-
munist movement, he left for
party schooling in Moscow.
Yet as soon as the success of
Mao’s Communism became
apparent Liu wasted no time
in giving it his loyalty.
“Liu Shao-chi has not, how-
ever, given unqualified support
to two major policy-making
mistakes of Mao. He was
enthusiastic neither about the
‘hundred flowers’ theory, nor
about the imminence of the
‘leap into Communism’; herein
may well lie his strength.”
The Cold Election
T ondon “Spectator” main-
tains that “it is as well,
now and again, to dismiss from
one’s mind the words ‘the cold
war,’ and to think, instead, of
a sort of very general—because
world-wide—election, with two
great parties competing, by
means of argument and
example, for the floating-vote
of the uncommitted nations of
Asia and Africa. For it is here,
by economic and ideological
penetration, that the cold war,
if the phrase has to be used,
will be won and lost.”
After pointing out that even
if the Berlin crisis is negotiated
with the utmost success this
election-campaign will go on ;
and that, in view of Nyasa-
land and Algeria, it is not
enough for the West to hope
that the example of Com-
munist imperialism in Tibet
will, on its own, swing many
uncommitted votes, the “Spec-
tator” adds:
“In the great campaign to
capture the minds and hearts
of the uncommitted world, the
one great prize that the West
can offer is freedom —or rather
Roosevelt’s four freedoms:
freedom of speech, freedom of
ICY BLAST.
London “News Chronicle" cartoon comment on Nehru’s
Parliamentary speech in which, denying Chinese allegations
that the Dalai Lama was taken to India under duress, he
protested against “Peking’s use of cold-war language, regardless
of truth or propriety,” in its attacks on India over Tibet.
worship, freedom from want,
and freedom from aggression.
“It may be that Communism
can offer freedom from want:
that has yet to be proved. It
is true that what Communism
claims to offer is offered in
simple and understandable
terms, whereas the West speaks
in more subtle and complicated
language. But Tibet has
shown, as Hungary showed,
how much freedom of speech,
freedom of worship, and
freedom from aggression
Africa and Asia can expect
from the Communist East.
“It has shown, too, that the
two great Communist Powers
have a good deal less respect
for the right of small and
backward nations to be free
and independent than the West
is supposed to have. Yet
nationalism is as powerful a
force now in Africa, Asia and
the Near East as ever it has
been in Europe in the past—
the only force as strong there
as Communism —and it is use-
less for the European Powers
to tell peoples that have never
known freedom and independ-
ence that nationalism is out-
of-date.
“Nationalism is never out-of-
date until it has been enjoyed
—and unless it is enjoyed the
four freedoms have little
appeal; until then It is a move-
ment that the West has to
recognise and respect, just as it
must make sure that when it
offers its gift of freedom it is
an unqualified freedom —not a
freedom that is accorded only
to all-white communities, such
as Canada, nor the freedom
that is accorded to white
settlers to exploit and oppress
non-whites, as in virtually every
part of Africa now where Eng-
lish is spoken: the Union,
Rhodesia, Kenya.
“The West has the unanswer-
able argument against the
dialectics of Moscow and
Peking, if only it dare pro-
nounce it. It is the dignity,
not of the white man, but of
man.”
English and Hindi
YI/Tlcoming the recommenda-
tion by an Indian Parlia-
mentary committee that Eng-
lish should continue as a sub-
sidiary official language “for as
long as may be necessary,”
even after Hindi becomes the
main official language in six
years’ time, “Manchester
Guardian” remarks that “it has
all along been clear that India
would suffer a serious loss if
the language in which so many
of her educated citizens have
been trained was cut off and
treated as just another foreign
language, though an important
one. On the other hand, parity
for English and Hindi would
have gone against the Indian
feeling of nationhood.
“If there is a law applicable
to all newly independent
nations, it is that they feel the
need to establish a native lan-
guage as the chief means of
communication on all matters,
including the most difficult and
elevated. In India this can only
be Hindi.
“Though the language may
now be inadequate for dealing
with certain highly technical
subjects, it will be surprising if
bold spirits do not go on striv-
ing to adapt it to all 20th-
century needs, just as Greeks
or Finns have since the last
century nursed languages which
had been clouded over by
foreign occupation or intellec-
tual disuse. Meanwhile, the
‘subsidiary’ position allotted to
English should take the sting
out of its survival as an official
language without,, one hopes,
impairing its use in education.
“Newly independent and
united nations at grips with
their languages have a special
problem, of which India’s is an
extreme case. As a rule, the
chosen national language is
universally spoken only in one
area, while elsewhere it is
spoken only by the educated
on formal occasions and not
always by them.
“This was, of course, at one
time just as true of the lan-
guages of England and France;
but in those countries the
national language became
established long before it
could be mixed-up with self-
conscious, combative nation-
alism of the modern type. With
several centuries of supremacy
behind it, it has quite shed any
feeling of something put on
when people are on their best
behavior.
“But even in Germany or
Italy, whose identity as nations
seems to us clear enough, the
learning and use of the national
language was until recently an
act of conscious virtue. For
some of their citizens it still is:
they really feel more comfort-
able speaking Sicilian or Low
German, even though they may
be perfectly capable of dealing
with teachers or civil servants
in the national tongue.
“Then, too, the chosen lan-
guage in these newer countries
often has clinging to it an air
of literary formality, probably
strengthened by borrowings
from antiquity (as in Greece,
where the ransacking of the
classical vocabulary leads to
such pleasing manufactures as

“Hindi has all these draw-
backs, with the added difficulty
that, as Mr. E. M. Forster once
said, India’s only peer is the
Holy Roman Empire, and
many of her people speak lan-
guages far more widely differ-
ent from Hindi than European

CANAL—WE THOUGHT IT WAS SWAN LAKE.”
prising if there were no Com-
munist manifestations after
such revolutions as were seen
in Argentina, Venezuela,
Colombia and Cuba. Dictators
in Latin America always pave
the way for the Reds, and the
first concern should be to hold
them responsible.
“For another thing, the Com-
munists are trained and ready
to move in once a lid blows off.
In none of these four countries
did they contribute anything
to the victory over military
tyranny. In all of them they
did their best to get on the
bandwagon in the final trium-
phant period and to claim an
exaggerated role with help
from the Moscow press and
radio.
“In Argentina the Reds
lined-up with the Peronists,
and both are now in the Oppo-
sition. The Venezuelans elected
one of the most powerful and
determined enemies of Com-
tion. In recent weeks we have
seen Russian diplomatic repre-
sentatives expelled from
Mexico and Argentina for be-
ing involved in strikes of
violence. Red nationals in both
these countries were arrested.
In Uruguay the Government
was reported recently to be
considering a rupture of diplo-
matic relations with the Soviet
Llnion. In Venezuela, after the
revolution last year, a sudden
growth of Communists in the
press, radio, television, trade-
unions and education was
noted with some alarm. In
Cuba, exactly the same phe-
nomenon is arousing surprise
and attention.
“In reality it would be sur-
munism in the hemisphere as
President—Romulo Betancourt.
In Cuba the Reds who seized
leading posts in some unions
in the first chaotic weeks were
driven out and union elections
are to be held.'
“Sooner or later Com-
munism goes counter to the
democratic aspirations of the
new regimes in Latin America,
and they then react, as we now
see them reacting in Argentina.”
Various Voices
Field-Marshal Viscount
Montgomery: “I do not believe
that this state of tension can
go on. I believe that the ordi-
nary men in the street are
absolutely fed-up with it. We
are all peace-loving people, but
here is Europe divided into
two great armed camps, and
each side is hurling threats of
nuclear destruction at the other.
The Generals are making mili-
tant speeches, and each side is
saying it won’t give up one
inch. I don’t think that is any
good. Any idea which is
sensible, which will try to
reduce the tension and get a
more flexible approach to this
affair, any idea of that nature
should be examined.”

Mr. Allen W. Dulles : “Those
who feel we can buy peace by
compromise with Khrushchev
are sadly deluded. Each con-
cession we give him merely
strengthens his position and
prestige and the ability of the
Soviet regime to continue its
domination of the Russian
people, whose friendship we
seek. The over-all power of
the free world is still vastly
superior to that under the
control of the leaders of inter-
national Communism. They
are not supermen.”

Dr. Adenauer: “He who
bears the burden of political
responsibility must reject any
sort of wishful thinking. An
inclination for wishful think-
ing is fatally dangerous, above
all in foreign policy, because
foreign policy determines the
fate of not only the present
but the future generations. We
all know how bitter, and often
bloody, illusions in foreign
policy have the habit of reveng-
ing themselves.”
Sir Winston Churchill: “Both
Russia and England have all
to gain and nothing to lose
from peace. The Soviets hope
that the doctrines of Karl Marx
may eventually prevail. We on
our side trust and believe that
as the mild and ameliorating
influence of prosperity begins
at last to uplift the Communist
world, so they will be more in-
clined to live at ease with their
neighbors. This is our hope.
We must not be rigid in our
expression of it; we must make
allowances for justifiable
Russian fears; we must be
patient and firm.”

ence between effective assist-
ance [to the underdeveloped

not the difference between a

clusion that the rule of law

provide at least a roof and a

Madam took 20 francs from
both of us. She also took our
bags, our passports and papers,
and invited us to surrender
any money we had. We laughed
deprecatingly and said that we
had so little it didn’t matter.
Taking our bags was a pre-
caution against theft, and
Ahmid added that I should
sleep in my boots. Taking our
papers was for the guidance
of the gendarmerie who called
at midnight and inspected all
the occupants. At 11 p.m. we
were to be locked in, we were
told ; and we would be released

Calais, though, are hostile ;
they are darker than the darkest
part of the Australian bush.
Faint figures flit about at
intervals, and the tired street-
lamps which seem to be going
out only deepen the gloom.
We trudged over gutters and
puddles, turned corners into
dense little crevasses between
buildings. We heard the
occasional cackle of human
emotion, like the still chuckle
of a possum in the night.
Very like a jungle, I thought ;
only possibly more dangerous.
Australians are supposed to
be the greatest leaners in the
world. They can lean on a
fence, on a shovel, over a bar.
But the Australian lean is one
of relaxation. It is innocent.
He leans because he doesn’t
want to do anything. The
French lean is different.
Frenchmen, especially in back-
streets, lean as much as Aus-
tralians do, but it is a calcu-
lated lean. They are relaxed
only against the emergency.
Theirs is the lean of the fighter
in his corner, the carefully
attentive repose of the cat

cross to the other side of the
road. I
We came to a doorway, and
two men were leaning on either
side of it. We went between
them, so that they made a kind
-of archway for us. We went
down steps, and came into a
badly - lighted underground
cafe. There was another
Madam, three girls, and a
pimply man.
Yes, they all knew Ahmid,
but their attitude was that of
people who had been glad
when he left, and sad when
he returned. I followed, not
asking questions because the
only questions to ask were
probably foolish questions and
I was anxious to seem at my
ease. Had I not led men
through 80 miles of unmapped
bush, navigating by gumleaf
and apple-core? Does such a
man who had so recently—last
week only, indeed —ambled up
the Pic de Jer in the French
Pyrenees for an afternoon
stroll, does such a man wince,
or feel a little uncertain ; un-
certain to the point of timidity
by merely entering a French
cafe. The answer is yes. He
does. So he tries not to show
it.
“Who’s he?” said one of the
girls, in French: jerking a
scarlet tipped finger towards
me.
She had a long cigarette in
her mouth, which she didn’t
remove. She had shapely legs
and showed nearly all of them.
Ahmid told her. He added
that I had a number of English
traveller’s cheques.
Madam brightened-up when
she heard this. Somebody
gave us a beer each, and I
looked dreamily into mine.
My interest in the French
language was aw’akened by
hearing such an interesting
subject discussed. My facul-
ties tuned desperately into the
memory of grammar and
vocabulary.
Madam was alarmed by
Ahmid’s candor; but he re-
assured her.
“It’s all right,” he said ; “he
doesn’t speak English.”
Madam thawed, smiled at
me maternally and gave me
another beer. I grinned ape-
ishly, and said, “Thank you,”
in broken English the better to
endorse my illiterate status.
ICor an hour they discussed
A me and my traveller’s
cheques.
During the conference, a
man named Dock came in: a
tall, well-built man who might
indeed have been a doctor.
They all looked as if they could
use a doctor sometimes. Dock
seemed as if he might find it
hard to obtain employment
anywhere else. He was well
dressed, but his face had that
indefinable something about it
which made one want to
punch it.
The temptation to do so was,
in my case, easily resisted. I
can resist many temptations.
Dock had another girl with
him. She didn’t seem to like
him, but stayed near to him.
He, too, joined in the dis-
cussion.
The main' point emerging
from this learned debate was
that, all things considered, the
amount was too small to bother
with; certainly too small to
warrant any risk. The pass-
port, now, that would be use-
ful, but it was under lock and
key. The money, pah! That
was a mere fleabite, not worth
the decent risk that a good
criminal felt bound to take.
Leave it to a street-pariah with
a'Cosh in his hand
The real difficulty was iden-
tity. Who was I? Did 1 have
friends in England?
Ahmid didn’t know, so
blandly asked me in English.
I replied sure, my uncle was
chief of Scotland Yard and
my aunt was expecting me that
very night and 1 must ring her
the moment 1 arrived in Eng-
land to call off the search she
was probably that moment
organising.
Ahmid passed this informa-
tion back to hiS friends. They
gave me another beer and I
, grinned like a hait-wit, and
spilt some of it. They all
grinned with sympathetic con-
tempt.
At 10.30 p.m. I yawned, and
asked should we return to the
flophouse. Ahmid hesitated,
and so did my heart. But he
agreed that the night had been
profitless and tola me in Eng-
lish that his friends couldn’t
help us.
By this time one of the molls
was teasing the little pander,
and Madam seemed to be get-
ting ready for a night’s work.
I had been debated, discussed,
and rejected as worthless.
With cordial farewells, my-
self fumbling exquisitely with
a gutteral “Oh, reevwah!”
which made them all positively
sneer, we stepped from the
brothel into the cool, fresh
night air of a Calais back-
street ; and the cool night air
never smelt so sweet, not even
in the Australian highlands.
TThe following morning an
official of the Banque de
France told me about a safe
opposite where they cashed
illegal British currency, and my
ten-bob note was turned into
breakfast for two.
The clouds had lifted and
the sun was shining and Calais,
even the whole of France,
seemed different. We strolled
to the waterfront together, and

sand between tumbled masses
of limestone boulders and flood
debris. Despite the rain, it
was dry as the proverbial bone.
We skirted the chasm until
we found a point where a
loaded party could descend ;
then, as the Melanesians say,
“broke bush” back to camp,
soaking wet, and dog-tired
after a 10-hours’ jaunt.
Chris reported that the car-
riers, with nothing to do all
day except regard their navels
and swap fearsome Mokolkol
yarns, had become exceedingly
nervous at our long absence.
It seemed that a hatchet-
wielding wildman lurked in
every shadow. Morale was not
improved by a sudden freak
drop in temperature, resulting
in our kidneys working over-
time. A shivering Nakanai
deputation requested that the
camp be moved next day, and
delicately hinted at the folly
of leaving the carriers inade-
quately protected. Old Moite
sneered at his younger com-
patriots’ softness, and I
cheered them up with an
additional snack of vegemite-
soup, spiked with bully and
hard-tack biscuits.
Huddling in sweaters under
a fly we checked plottings, and
concluded that, despite the
map, the village probably lay
five or six mlies to our south-
west, back towards the coast,
and west of the main gorge.
We drank tea and pondered.
If our deductions were correct,
the place wasn’t very far west
of the main gorge, but we still
didn’t know precisely where.
Two of tire kaulons, sent up
a tall tree to search for
cooking - fires or smoke,
reported negatively. As the
crow flies, we were probably
dangerously close: unless we
could surprise the Mokolkols
within the next 24 hours they
would probably get wind of us
—if they hadn't already done
so —and flee.
HThe next morning, a Sunday,
broke clear and sunny,
but by the time we had
climbed down into the canyon
a stiff north-west breeze had
begun to drive dark cumulus
in from the coast. This was
a relief, despite the danger
of a sudden flood: villagers
are less inclined to wander
about if the weather is wet, and
the wind-direction was in our
favor.
The patrol - column was
under strict orders to observe
complete silence, and I had
Constable Bosi, the wily old
bushman, scouting several
bends, ahead. Behind him, two
of the most agile police investi-
gated every possible means of
ascent on either side of the
canyon.
It was slow, difficult climb-
ing over the boulders and
erosions in the canyon floor,
and the carriers, poor devils,
had a tough time of it. Then,
after nearly three-hours’ pain-
ful progress, we rounded one
more bend and were waved to
a halt by a scout.
1 went up to him and he
silently indicated where Bosi,
around the next corner, had
gone to earth behind a
boulder.
Fifty yards ahead, on the
west side, the limestone was
broken by an intrusion of
dark, loose shale, streaming
down like a steep earth-slip.
Eighty yards below this point
a shaft of sunlight glinted on
a steady trickle of water
emerging from limestone
crevices in the canyon floor.
Just as he had rounded the
bend, said Bosi, he had “smelt”
the water and hidden himself.
Then he saw a woman, with
two bamboo water-containers,
clamber up the shale bank and
disappear. We were in luck.
I sent back word for the
halted patrol to disperse behind
boulders along the gorge, and
with Bosi climbed up the shale.
Its soapy fragments showed no
tracks, and it took us some
time to discover where the
woman had gone. Near the
top there were several huge
boulders, behind one of which
was a narrow passage, leading,
by way of a series of ledges,
to where the weathered grey
limb of a fallen tree jutted
through a crack in the canyon
rim.
The trunk led nowhere, but
halfway along its length there
was a flat-topped boulder which
served as a step to another
mouldering forest-giant. From
the far end of this led a slight
but clearly discernible trail,
showing occasional traces of
fresh tracks: a woman and
child, said Bosi.
I removed my spiked boots,
and we scouted the trail along
a broad ridge for more than
half-a-mile. Somewhat belat-
edly, it occurred to me that
bushmen as skilled as the
Mokolkols could probably
recognise each other’s tracks
at a glance
I sat down, longing for a
cigarette, and sent Bosi to
investigate further. He was
soon back: the village was no
more than 600yds. away, and
was occupied.
“Do you think they’re
Mokolkols?”
“Who else? Only Mokolkols,
pigs and masalai live in this
bush. That woman I saw was
a Mokolkol.”
“What about Japs?”
Bosi spat. “Where are their
tracks? Besides, you know
the Japanese fashion. We’d
hear them talking from this
distance.”
v
T\7e returned to the gorge and
* * planned the next move
over a hasty bite of cheese and
biscuits. Surprise was essen-
tial, and that meant speed.
The fiickle weather had turned
clear and sunny again, and
most of the people should still
be working in the gardens.
These, from McCarthy’s
description, we knew were
beyond the village. We couldn't
hope to catch the Mokolkols
there. My police were too
few and too inexperienced to
risk a night-raid. >.
Theoretically, a- descent on
the village just at daylight
should catch everyone at home,
but with these people 1 dared
not wait so long. Besides, even
if we withdrew to a safe dis-
tance and camped, the chances
were that some wary savage
with an educated eye would
come down the trail before
nightfall and detect signs of
strangers. If that occurred,
we’d miss out, badly.
I decided to raid the village
immediately, grab what was
offering, and see what
eventuated.
I took young Chris and
seven police, together with
eight Nakanai volunteers and
old Moite, who was pessimisti-
cally sure that we would not
reach the place unobserved.
Bill Heather, eager to be in
the fun, reluctantly agreed to
stay and look after the jittery
carriers.
With Bosi leading, we
sneaked back along the tor-
tuous trail, expecting to meet
a surprised wildman at every
bend. Finally we reached a
point where the ridge broad-
ened, and Bosi, eyes glittering
strangely in his weathered
face, indicated that this was it.
We could smell smoke, and a
faint scrap of talk, like some-
one admonishing a child,
wafted to us on the hot, drowsy
air.
So far, so good.
{To be continued next week.)
paused in the moment of
departure as friends will. The
British Railways packet was
alongside, its gangway yawn-
ing a British welcome. It was
a touching moment: Ahmid
was about to go to work,
seducing American cigarettes
ashore, and I was about to
sail for England and put on a
clean shirt. Our ways, once
they began to diverge, would
tend to go on diverging.
Ahmid said, “You will be
all right now.”
I said I would. Then I
added, with a strenuous effort
at perfection of accent: “Merci
bien, m’sieu. Voi/s etes un ami
vrai.”
Ahmid looked at me, a little
sharply, and said with a slight
note of surprise: “You speak
French?”
1 replied: “Un peu, m’sieu.”
A little. “Mais assez, assez,
pour un voyageur.” Enough
for a traveller.
Ahmid said, “Oh!” He
thought a moment and then
said it again. I thanked him
again, but, as we shook hands,
he seemed lost in thought.
When I looked back from
the deck of the ferry, he was
still standing there ; still
thoughtful. But as I waved,
he waved ; then he grinned, a
wide, villainous Arabian grin
which bubbled into a laugh.
And that was the last I ever
saw of him.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Subsidising Union Ballots
The Federal Government’s
move in offering to subsidise
union-ballots—i.e., to pay the
difference between the cost of
a union-controlled and a
court-controlled ballot —is one
of the sanest pieces of legisla-
tion introduced since the war.
But if Minister McMahon
thinks the difference will be
appreciable only in “isolated
instances” he’s in for con-
siderable enlightenment. I’d
say in the average case it would
cost nearly double to run the
ballot through the Arbitration
Court.
But, whatever it costs the
Commonwealth Government
in subsidies, the country will
be well in front. Union-
officials who insist on running
their own ballots have only one
effective argument against the
court control—the added cost
to the union, and there’s no
doubt unions which have
approached the court have
found it costly. Remove that
argument, and the candidate
who isn’t satisfied with the
union’s returning-officer can
put up a good case to have
the ballot run by someone
appointed by the court.
Later the Acts governing the
State and Federal Arbitration
Courts could be amended to
provide that if one candidate
applies for court control it
shall be granted automatically.
—Pieter Nuyts (W.A.).
Voltaire
1 did not quote Voltaire as
being in favor of new religions
(B. 6/5/’59). All I did was to
correct the source of a quota-
tion. No one, not even Voltaire
himself, knew what Voltaire
was in favor of.
Incidentally, and purely for
the sake of historical accuracy,
may I point out to Martin
Haley that the only steps Vol-
taire was capable of making
“at the end” were made when
he petulantly waved aside the
ministrations of two priests
(one was his nephew). And
his body was laid to rest in
consecrated ground only be-
“So they really DO exist”
cause the priests hurried it there
before "the bishop could get in
with his episcopal rejection. .
Martin Haley can keep on
putting his trust in Noyes if
he so wishes, but he could
be easily enlightened if he
were to refer to Catholic
authorities about the matter.
Voltaire’s assertion about God
is relevant to the starting of
new religions because most new
religions do assume the exist-
ence of God. — Bon Chat (Q.).
Weather Forecasts
The other night I heard a
Weather Bureau official,
broadcasting through a com-
mercial station in Sydney,
gloomily say that the pleasant
autumn weather of the pre-
vious four days had come to
an end and that wind and rain
would sweep along the South
Coast to Sydney during the
night. He even mentioned
that rain accompanying the
change had already begun to
fall.
The following morning,
papers carried the same dis-
mal report; but by that time
another change had come over
the weather and the 6 a.m.
forecasts, through the broad-
casting - stations, held out
hopes of a fine, mild day, with
a probable continuation of
such conditions for a further
two days.
Happily this forecast
proved correct; but 1 heard
no explanation from the
bureau of what had become
of the wind and rain it had
pictured as sweeping down on
us less than 12 hours earlier.
In the absence of such an
explanation many people
probably dismissed the
bureau’s second forecast as a
lot of hot air; thus further
encouraging the cynical atti-
tude towards weather-reports
generally which is so prevalent
today.
No sensible person would
expect forecasts to be always
accurate: the weather changes
so frequently without warn-
ing, and all the bureau can
hope to do is to keep reason-
ably up-to-date on such
changes and tell people about
them. Where I do disagree
with the bureau’s policy is in
describing the forecasts which
it issues at least three times
a day as covering the “follow-
ing 24 hours.”
What sense is there in
issuing a forecast, say, at
6 a.m. for the “following 24
hours” and issuing another at
noon, again for. the “follow-
ing 24 hours”? Such over-
lapping merely confuses
people. Anyone who accepts
the 6 a.m. forecast as cover-
ing the 24 hours until six-
o’clock the next morning will
often not bother to listen to
the midday or evening fore-
casts and is thus unaware of
any changes that have
worked-up in the meantime.
The Weather Bureau would
enjoy greater public confi-
dence, and people who plan
their activities on its forecasts
would be much better in-
formed, if such forecasts
covered only, say, six-hour
periods, and this was clearly
stated at the time of broad-
casting.—M.F.D. (N.S.W,).
Denominational Schools
To the facts supplied by
“8.J.L.” (B. 29/4/’59) might
be added the following: that
in. the Archdiocese of Mel-
bourne alone loans to the
Archdiocese’s Schools Provi-
dent Fund now total
£3,441,893. This money has,
since 1956, been loaned by
Catholics in Victoria to their
Archbishop (Dr. Mannix) to
meet school-building require-
ments. These Catholics are,
of course, also helping—in
taxation —in the upkeep of the
State system of education, of
which they, in eonscience, dis-
approve.—Fiat Justicia (Q.).
Beating the Double Tax
The excellent comments on
“Thrift and Spivvery” (B.
22/4/’59) can be elaborated.
Double taxation exists, but
there are ways of avoiding it.
To help the primary pro-
ducer, tax-concessions were
originally given to organisa-
tions comprising men on the
land, but it was obviously never
intended that the double tax
should be avoided by retailers
or wholesalers forming groups
for the express purpose of side-
stepping taxes.
We have plenty of evidence
that the primary producer has
at times been badly treated by
some of the companies buying
his produce. He had to com-
bine with other producers to

save his hide. Now the
burden of taxation becomes
heavier on all of us because
the financial wizards at Can-
berra can’t see the difference
between the primary producers'
case and that of the tax-evaders
or self-styled merchant co-
operatives. The latter are only
private companies and must be
taxed as such. But don’t con-
fuse the cases —hands off the
primary producer!
Tax-evasion is being prac-
tised in a big way ; let’s hope
the new Treasurer will
straighten things quickly. It’s
not a party affair—it’s a Com-
monwealth matter. — F/\ir Tax-
ation (S.A.).
Classifying Schoolchildren
“Presbyter” (B. 29/4/’59) is
astray in giving the lowest age
for admission to N.S.W. high-
schools as 11 years, six
months. Actually, it is 11
years although, admittedly,
most primary headmasters dis-
courage entry to high-school
until the pupil is at least 11
years, 6 months.
Some of these pupils enter
university at 16 years, six
months ; but is this really too
young? It depends, of course,
on the social and emotional
maturity of the pupil, and the
pupil of \l\ years will be a
better university prospect than
one of 161 years, all other
things being equal. However,
parents meet economic hard-
ship in keeping children at
school for that extra year.
It is sometimes wrongly
assumed that these young en-
trants to the university do
badly. Actually, since they
are brighter than the average
entrant, they do very well,
and attempts to link failure at
the university with immaturity
of years have not been sup-
ported by facts.
The implementation of the
Wyndham Report, since it will
place an additional financial
strain on many parents, will
provide another reason for
allowing the young bright
pupil to proceed to high-
school.—Top (N.S.W.)
Asian Invasion
The trouble, “Tock Emma”
(B. 22/4/’59), is that when war
is in the air those “Asiatic
hordes’’ will have no say in the
matter. Like all soldiers, con-
scripted or voluntary, they will
obey orders —or else.
It isn’t the masses who make
wars, but the politicians. When,
if ever, the time to invade Aus-
tralia comes, no member of
the “horde” will be asked
whether or not he wishes to
live in Australia. Some other
pretext will be used to rouse the
hostility of millions of com-
mon people who have probably
never even heard of Australia.
Does anybody believe that
the masses of India had any
hand in the British evacuation
of India? Or that the masses
of Indonesia care twopence
about West New Guinea—a
territory most of them have
never heard of? Of course
not.
It is the arrogant, power-
hungry politician—a mere split
fraction of Asian, African, or
even European politicians—
who decide these matters,
regardless of the democrats
who put them in power.
Yet, with the often mistaken
urge to give everybody a “fair
go” — 1 in the vain hope that
Western-type democracy will
take root even among people
often no more than a genera-
tion removed from savagery
and still dominated by tribal
instincts and superstitions—we
foolishly forget that it’s less
than half a century since the
P.B. British infantry foot-
slogged through the fever-
ridden jungles of Africa to un-
seat the murderous King
Prempeh from his blood-soak-
ed throne in Coomassie (as it
was then spelled), now part of
a new sovereign State called
Ghana, where British-educated
politicians are busy t ying to
set fire to Africa. Talk about
asking for it! Onlooker
(N.Z.).
Pleasure-steamers
“Ceg's” reminiscences of the
pleasure-steamers that once
plied on Port Phillip Bay (B.
15/4/’59) strike a nostalgic
note for middle-aged Mel
bournites like myself, whose
children are denied the adven-
turous thrill of that Bay-trip
we so often enjoyed in our
childhood.
Port Phillip Bay isn’t the
only place to lose its pleasure-
craft. Victoria’s Gippsland
Lakes, an extensive system of
waterways, was once a busy
thoroughfare ; in the 1920's no
fewer than four passenger-
steamers sailed or steamed
regularly from Sale or Bairns-
dale to Lakes Entrance.
Again, the Murray River
system is practically devoid of
traffic ; I think there are only
two passehger-boats still run-
ning along a limited stretch of
the Murray, though at one time
steamers went up the Goul-
burn River as far as Seymour.
The truth is partly, as “Ceg”
says, that Melbourne people
—and Victorians generally
are a lot of landlubbers who
prefer the smell of petrol-fumes
and tarred roads to the whiff of
a good sea-breeze. But, then,
the cost of buying, equipping
and operating suitable pas-
senger-craft is so high, and the
prospect of getting a reasonable
return on initial outlay is so
uncertain, that no one is game
enough to stage a pleasure-
steamer revival. I’m sure sorry
for the youngsters of this
generation.— Doynest (Vic.).
Reading Poetry
In 'his comments on off-
rhymes “D.S.” (B. 25/3/’59)
seems to be trammelling the
aspiring poet with unnecessary
restrictions.
The poet writes for a select
few. Not all readers are inter-
ested in poetry, and the poet,
unless he is a genius, can
appeal only to a proportion.
Needless to say, he regards his
work seriously, and is entitled
to assume that his verse will
be read at the same speed and
with the same care as by a
competitor at an eisteddfod.
Every syllable should be given
its proper value and time. In
this case there will be no undue
distortion of one word by its
rhyming companion, though a
vague sense of rhyme will
linger in the background.
People who gabble poetry


as if it were doggerel—making
“shallow” into “shaller” (when
rhymed with “taller”) —must
be disregarded. And anyone
who shudders at the “watcher”-
“creature” rhyme is pretty
obviously paying more atten-
tion to spelling than to sound,
pronunciation or meaning. As
for “cattle”-“wattle”: if both
words are given their correct
pronunciation and timing they
dwell-as peaceably together as
the living things they represent.
There are, of course, degrees
of skill in using off-rhymes,
but let us avoid putting
obstacles in the path of our
poets. Poetry is written to be
read more than once; that
which doesn’t survive the first
reading is still-born.’ Critics
would surely be better
employed issuing warnings
about the application of fast-
reading techniques to poetry.
The essence of poetry is verbal
music, and, like pure music,
poetry will not bear speeding-
up.—A. K. Mathew (N.S.W.).
Mental Health Year
Now that the International
Geophysical Year is over, the
next big all-pull-together effort
by the nations is going to be
World Mental Health Year.
Sponsored by the World
Federation of Mental Health
and its member - societies
throughout the world, this col-
lective attempt to stimulate
wider interest in mental illness
and its problems, and to dis-
seminate information concern-
ing them, will be celebrated (or
perhaps one had better say
observed) in 1960 will be,
that is, if international antagon-
isms haven’t blown the earth
to smithereens.
That the problem of mental
illness is serious is indicated by
a statement of Dr. M. G.
Candau, director-general of
the World Health Organisa-
tion:—
If the amount of bodily disease
in the world reached the propor-
tions of many of the existing social
ills with mental and emotional
causes (delinquency, alcoholism,
drug-addiction, suicide, etc.), not
to mention classical mental disease,
an epidemic state would be declared
and strong measures taken to
combat it.
He added that in countries
with well-developed health-
services about half the total
number of hospital-beds are
occupied by psychiatric cases,
and studies of out-patients at
large general hospitals show
that one-third or more attend
for complaints that can be
traced to psychological causes.
Possibly improved diagnosis
is partly responsible for the
statistical increase in mental
ill-health, but there can be
little question that it has in-
creased tremendously during
the present century, particularly
in countries enjoying a high
standard of living.
In Australia, which rates
very high indeed in social wel-
fare, personal income and the
geographical conditions that
should make for healthy living,
mental ill-health has our
authorities seriously worried,
and more and more money is
being demanded to provide
facilities for the treatment of
it.
Is it the shadow of conflict
that has hung over the world
this last half-century, and
hangs over it today, that is
affecting man’s mental health?
Perhaps, but conflict is no
novelty: war and the threat of
war occupy every page in
human history.
The causes must lie deeper
—perhaps in our incessant
reaching out for physical satis-
factions and material things,
our rejection of religion as a
vital part of living, our con-
ception, of work as something
to be tolerated for the sake of
the pay-packet. The World
Mental Health Year may help
to provide, for some of us at
least, a few of the answers. —
D. J. G. (Vic.).
Too Small for Privacy
There's a lot in what “Castle-
reagh” says about house-proud
modern parents and the way
many children suffer by
being debarred from home
activities (B. 6/5/‘59). Apart
from parents’ fears that their
prized furniture may be
knocked about, there’s the im-
portant fact that modern homes
are usually far too small for
comfortable family living.
This point was stressed the
other day by a child-welfare
expert, Dr. Doris Officer. The
trend towards smaller houses,
she pointed out, meant lack of
privacy for all members of the
family. With only one living-
room, for instance, parents
can’t get away from their
children, and this has reper-
cussions on both sides. Parents
don't want children playing in

In the early post-war period,
of course, the area of a house
was subject to strict controls,
and when these were relaxed,
costs prevented many people
from building more than a
minimum-sized home.
Also, the fashion among
architects was to design houses
without passages: this cer-

that the principal rooms be-

■piNALLY, Mavis Moten, help-
ing to organise the Austra-
lian delegation as a member of
the Festival Information Centre
in Sydney, gave some further
data on the Australian delega-
tion. She also admitted being
worried about what might
happen in Vienna.
She said the organisers, now
selecting the 30 Australian dele-
gates, would try to “cover
sport, cultural activities, and
others.” Each delegate chosen
would “represent some form
of Australian life.” Some
trade-unions would be sending
delegates, and in one State
a Labor Council was holding
a competition at a tramways-
workshop to select a represen-
tative. A shearer and a gym-
nast had been chosen already,
and the final team would be
known any day now.
Two tour-managers, who
had been overseas before,
would travel with the Austra-
lian delegation, she said. The
delegation would make the
longest train-journey in the
world —eight days from Peking
to Moscow, two days further
to Budapest, and then over-
night to Vienna. After Vienna
they would go to Prague.
She said about 17,000 would
attend the Festival, compared
with 34,000 at the Moscow
Youth Festival. This was
because there was not so much
accommodation in Vienna as
in Moscow. The Austrian
Government had made avail-
able a place jlike Sydney Show-
ground for an international
village.
Mavis Moten said that China
(“the most powerful nation in
the Pacific”) had been very
good to the Australian delega-
tion’s organisers and had asked
them to send ahead an out-
line of the things the various
delegates would like to see
while in China. She regretted
that Australia could not
reciprocate at this stage by
asking young people to come
to a similar Festival here.
She said there was “tremen-
dous debate” in Austria about
th'e Festival. Catholic youth-
organisations were behind the
opposition, she believed.
Austrian groups opposing the
Festival had written to all
countries sending delegates.
The Australian Festival Com-
mittee had received a letter
from them, she said. “They
said they proposed to take ‘all
legal and other means’ to pre-
vent the Festival being held,”
she said.
She said the Australian
organisers were not too happy
about those other means.

What can be done about a
home that is cramped and
lacks privacy? Selling-out and
buying a larger house is out
of the question for most people,
but there are other ways.
In a timber house, internal
walls can be altered without
much difficulty or expense. I
greatly improved the living-
facilities of my home by
doubling the size of the
“You have a beautiful epiglottis, but your top notes

kitchen and eliminating a use-
less “dining-alcove” off the
lounge-room, simply by switch-
ing around a few feet of in-
ternal wall. The cost was
trifling.
The need for privacy for
teenage children, particularly,
should be recognised ; a roomy
veranda, or even a separate
sleepout, giving access to the
yard, means increased comfort
and freedom for the whole
family.
Parents who have the welfare
of their children at heart will
try to give them a real home
and not merely a showplace for
furniture, even if it means
temporarily foregoing the new
car, the new TV-set, or other
less essential puchases. Children
don’t really want luxuries;
they want a place where they
can pursue their hobbies, play
their games, and to which they
can bring their pals without in-
cessant risk of rebuke for
making a noise or spoiling the
carpets. — Ardoyne (Vic.).
Graham and Gewgaws
While Billy Graham in one
part of Sydney Showground
held the attention of many
thousands of Sydney citizens,
several thousands more, in ad-
jacent buildings, were bouncing
around on settees, trying-out
beds and testing clipper-chairs.
The comfort-seeking multi-
tude was investigating the
annual Furniture Exhibition, at
which every manufacturer of
importance in the State was
represented. In my view of
what was on offer the three
large exhibition-halls demon-
strated that furniture-design in
Australia needs saving.
There were acres of china-
cabinets with inflated glass
fronts, chromium-chairs for
all the world like gymnasium-
equipment, period cocktail-
cabinets, and such furniture -
accessories as inlaid, jewelled
furniture-knobs.
To me, the exhibition repre-
sented a deplorable departure
from the basic principles of
good furniture-design. One
hopeful sign was an exhibition
of paintings from schools, and
amongst the furniture- and
fabric-designs there were
flashes of real talent and a
genuine feeling for color.
On a few stands manufac-
turers were trying to uphold
high standards with chairs that
looked like chairs and had
some respect for the human
body, tables which showed
finish and care and fabrics
which didn’t look like covers
for an Espresso-machine.
Australian furniture-manu-
facturers seem to need their
own Billy Graham, a fervent
spirit who could combine
something of Morris and
Ruskin, and who would not be
afraid to point out that
designs such as many of those
at the exhibition are little short
of sinful.—J. M. T. (N.S.W.).


Most sheep-owners are
aware that Caseous
Lymph - Adenitis, or
C.L.A. Disease as it is
popularly called, is con-
tracted through wounds
and cuts becoming
infected with bacteria
living in the soil.
The most obvious way
of reducing the risk of
C.L.A. Disease is to
reduce the number of
open wounds or cuts
indicted on lambs and
sheep, and this is just
one of the many reasons
why more and more
breeders are using the
Elastrator Rubber Ring
method of castrating,
marking and tailing.
It is a proven fact that
lambs marked and
tailed by the Elastrator
Rubber Ring method
are less susceptible to
the many dangers of

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
BREEDING AND FEEDING
From R. A. PRICE
TTowever we manipulate the
processes of harvesting,
handling and selling milk, the
cow herself is the foundation
of the whole enterprise, and
the relative importance of her
breeding and feeding remains
the main question.
This persists as a problem
because it differs for every cow
and on every farm. Each
factor is dependent on the
other, so that climbing to
success in dairying is like
climbing to the top of two
separate ladders at once. You
can only do it by getting be-
tween them, with a foot on
each ladder and raising each
foot alternately, a step at a
time, till you reach the top.
It may be true that, where
feed is rough and poor in
quality, but also plentiful and
cheap, a large herd of low-
yielding cows may do almost
as well as any others. When
cows have an inherited capacity
for high production, only a
high level of feeding will bring
this into full play and allow
us to benefit from it.
But however poor the feed
there will always be significant
differences in the use made of
“Take no notice, chicks, he's golf-mad”
it by different cows. A good
cow both eats more and gets
more out of it. So first steps
in breeding should be to cull
the poorest producers and
select as replacements daugh-
ters of the better cows.
If no corresponding step is
taken on the feeding side, these
better cows will remain limited
by the small amount of
nourishment available, but
when the supply is improved
those capable of using it will
move ahead and a few more
tail-enders will be left for
culling.
Numbers can usually be
reduced considerably when it
is known for certain which are
the non-paying guests. Fewer
cows on the same feed can
give more milk, or, if the feed
goes on improving, the same
number of better cows can give
very much more milk. Output
to the man-hour will be
greater, as well as returns from
investment in feed.
Not only does a good cow
show greater body-efficiency —•
less nourishment wasted —but
also there is the saving on body-
maintenance by having fewer
cows. Two low-yielders would
be required to produce 80001 b.
of milk in a year. They would
need nearly twice the amount
of food for body-maintenance
that would be needed by one
good cow producing the same
quantity.
The difference would be
equivalent to about 151 b. of
good oaten hay a day—enough
protein and more than enough
carbohydrates for a gallon of
milk.
An average cow can handle
enough rough feed to maintain
herself and produce about
2gal. of milk a day. To get
more milk there must be more
food-value (particularly pro-
tein) in a less bulky kind of
feed. So it’s necessary to have
legumes and young leafy
grasses for cows able to pro-
duce 3gal. to sgal a day.
Above this level it becomes
necessary to give more feed
with even less bulk, substitut-
ing hay and concentrates for
some of the sappy grass. The
really high producers are those
whose stomachs and tempera-
ments allow them to handle
large quantities of concentrated
feed.
A man feeding cattle inten-
sively gives a cow a little more
than she needs theoretically,
and watches for an increase in
the yield. As long as he gets
a profitable increase he keeps
on increasing the feed. When
the yield stops rising he stops
increasing the feed.
As a good general rule, give
as much top-quality roughage
as the cow can eat, adding lib.
of concentrates for every 41b.
to 61b. milk yielded, dependent
on the nature of the roughage.
Also dependent on the nature
of the roughage is the protein-
content of the concentrates.
This might vary from 10 per
cent, to 40 per cent, to suit
roughage varying from prime
legumes to mature sweet-
sorghum, which is high in
carbohydrates but low in
protein.
The key-factor in the climb
up the twin ladders is herd-
recording. Without an accu-
rate measure of the worth of
a cow and the value of a
feeding-programme both breed-
ing and feeding will ,be with-
out direction.
Factory - returns give a
general picture, but omit useful
details. There’s no evidence
on which to cull a cow or select
a replacement. Without indi-
vidual records feeding may be
based on misconceptions and
upset by sudden drops in pro-
duction of just one or- two
cows.
Recording reveals
of the cow which makes a big
splash for two or three months
and then fades right out, living
on her reputation for the rest
of the year. The one that main-
tains a fair yield for about 10
months is much more valuable,
and the one that goes on work-
ing hard for 12 or 14 years
is the one whose daughters are
worth their weight in butter-
fat, two or three times over.
But there must be proof in
the form of production-figures.
Herd-recording need not be
official —there are many ways
now of measuring milk as it
goes through the machines,
and the fat-test is not hard
to do —but official figures can

be quoted for sales, and there
are useful conclusions to be
drawn from a system covering
all parts of the country.
Breeding and feeding based
on accurate recording of indi-
vidual yields seems to offer a
clearly marked way to higher
efficiency in dairying. It is
possible to improve the average
yield of a herd from 40001 b. of
milk to well over 60001 b. in
under 10 years without any
expensive buying of stock ; yet
the average yield of the dairy-
cows of N.S.W., based on total
numbers and factory-returns, is
about 40001 b much more
than it was 20 years ago.
That’s all the improvement we
can expect, though, when only
about 4 per cent, of the cows
are herd-recorded.
The 38,000 cows completing
tests in the group-testing
scheme in 1957 averaged
47391 b. milk, against an
average of 39001 b. from 20,000
cows eight years ago. The
3346 pure-bred cows tested in
1956 gave an average of 77871 b.
milk, with 3241 b. butterfat. In
Victoria, with mostly Jerseys,
there were 180,000 cows tested
(about 17 per cent, of all cows)
and the average milk-yield was
55401 b.
Why talk so much about the-
need for efficient production
when we fail to use a means
as effective to it as herd-
recording? Many farmers con-
sider the £5O to £lOO a year it
costs a waste of money, but
even on the poor figures in
N.S.W. the average improve-
ment of at least £7 a cow a
year is well ahead of the
average cost of, at most, £2.
There are unsatisfactory
features about the present
system which hamper its work-
ing and make it unattractive
to those who should be using
it. The necessity to accommo-
date a herd-tester is a burden
on many farmers, who haven’t
the large establishments once
so common. The herd-tester is
not always a pleasant person
to introduce into a family
circle —any more than every
farmer is a good man for a
herd-tester to live with, even
for a day or so.
Again, the work of the. herd-
tester is not always depend-
able, either through laziness or
lack of ability, and it’s true
that men with ability can often
get a better job elsewhere.
Herd-testing is a hard life,
poorly paid, with little future
and much bureaucratic annoy-
ance and frustration; conse-
quently the turnover in herd-
recorders is high. I know a
unit which had at least 10
different men, most of them
new recruits, in 11 years. This
keeps the scheme in a state
of perpetual unrest and
inefficiency, prevents new
herds from being able to join,
and causes members to leave
it in disgust.
There are ways in which the
official recording-service might
be improved and extended.
First of all, encouragement
from the Minister and Govern-
ment officers in charge of it,
the granting of finance, and the'
priority and full attention that
such an urgent matter requires.
Then there should be proper
recruitment, training and pay-
ing of staff, in order to get
men able to do the job well
and willing to stay in it. There
could be variations of the
staffing - scheme. A period
of herd - testing, gaining
acquaintance with at least 20
farms, would be good experi-
ence for anyone training for
agricultural science or for an
advisory service.
Women are herd-testers in
some countries, ancl there are
man-and-wife teams who test
two herds at one stop, using
a caravan and a car and having
their own accommodation and
laboratory. Such a team could
do three places at one stop by
taking an apprentice with them
—and this would also help
with his training.
Greater use could be made
of laboratories at factories and
depots, so that the farmer does
the weighing and sampling and
samples are sent in for testing.
If the farmer cheats, the chief
dupe is himself.
There should also be prompt-
ness in publication of results
and analyses, and more atten-
tion paid to the lessons to be
learned from the figures.
Finally, the information
must be applied by the farmers
to their own individual prob-
lems in breeding and feeding.
Manure for Citrus
“Big Billy” : Assessing results
of trials at the Berri (S.A.)
experimental orchard over the
last 45 years, J. R. Botham,
citrus research-officer, said that
Bcwt. nitrogen an acre, or
about 101 b. a tree, is needed
each year to ensure consistently
high yields. He warned against
higher rates of application,
though ; these may give higher
yields, but they also reduce the
quality of the fruit.
Cheapest sources of nitrogen
are sulphate-of-ammonia and
urea, which are recommended
as a soil-application for citrus
at these rates: sulphate-of-
ammonia, Bcwt. an acre or
101 b. a tree ; urea, 34cwt. an
acre or 441 b. a tree. July is the
best month to apply dressings
of fertilisers; it allows time
for them to be thoroughly
absorbed by the roots before
spring. It’s best to split the
dressing into three or four
applications a year for young
trees, which generally need less
than older ones. As a guide,
give lib. sulphate or 41b. urea
for each year of age, up to the
maximum quoted.
Fertilisers are best applied
by broadcasting after irriga-
tion. This stops the roots from
burning after .heavy dressings
and prevents the material leach-
ing beyond the roots and so
being lost to them. Urea may
be pumped through the spray-
lines to ensure even distribu-
tion throughout the orchard.
Compared with sulphate, which
needs a bigger application-
rate, this saves labor and cuts
costs of handling and freight- -
and it does not damage the
irrigation-pipes.
The Berri tests show beyond
doubt that on most soiis citrus
needs only nitrogen as a
fertiliser, though Botham
emphasised that an annual
dressing of super, should also
be given to encourage the
growth of cover-crop legumes.
Where zinc is lacking in the
soil, spray in early spring with
an initial dose of commercial
zinc neutralised with ground
hydrated lime at the rate of
101 b. zinc-sulphate, 51b. lime
and 100 gal. water, if the lack
of zinc—shown by yellowing
leaves and stunted growth—is
not corrected by this, use a
combined spray of zinc and
manganese: 51b. zinc mixed
with 21b. manganese and 241 b.
hydrated lime in lOOgal. water.
The residue of this spray is
difficult to remove, so leave it
until after the' fruit has been
harvested.

of linseed contain hydrocyanic-
acid, the poison that makes

Hypo is a sure antidote, pro-

soon as the first symptoms are
noticed. Drench cows with
2oz. hypo in a bottle of water.
The drug acts quickly, but if
recovery seems slow give
another 2oz. an hour or so
later. The poisoning some-
times affects the swallowing-
mechanism, so some of the

Farm Management
“R. 5.8.”: Congratulations
to “C.8.M.” on his article (B.
29/4/’59). I read quite a lot
and have spent a lifetime on
the land, but I’ve never read
an article containing more
sound, practical advice for the
small farmer. I would like to
see it reprinted in every country
newspaper.
Farm Costs
“Ruddigore”: A business-
man with a £lO,OOO proposition
on his hands would be cosrt-
conscious. He would have
access to trade-journals that
would guide and advise him on
the most profitable form and
level of production and ex-
plain what factors could be
“Hullo, Mrs. Dibley! Guess what WE brought back from Queensland P”
substituted for others to cut
costs and bump-up profits.
The farmer has no such
guide readily available to him,
although even a modest farm
would realise £lO,OOO at the
present time.
Not enough attention has
been paid to the economics of
farming in Australia. Overseas,
farm-economics forms an im-
portant part of the industry.
Farm-economists have the data
at their fingertips and can
advise a farmer how to tackle
any problem.
It isn’t just theory, either,
as much economic advice
generally proves to be, but the
result of costing on different
farms where a common
problem is tackled in various
ways. From information ob-
tained it is possible to compare
costs and returns on farms of
the same type.
Work of this kind has been
attempted in Australia, but
much more is needed. What
we 'want to know is the answer
to questions, such as
whether it will pay to feed
concentrates to dairy-cattle,
and, if it will, then at what
level? Or what part does the
existing production of the herd
play in this problem, and could
a dairyfarmer get his money
back if he fed on concentrates
a herd that was doing reason-
ably well on grass?
In the past too much atten-
tion has been paid to total
production. For instance, the
chap on grass may be able to
increase his total production
quite a lot by feeding concen-
trates, but will the extra pro-
duction pay for the. cost of
feed and time spent in feeding
it? I haven’t come across any-
one yet who can give me a
clear answer to this. Some
say it doesn't pay to feed
bought feed unless the cows
are milking very well ; others
say the cows may not be
~ r u ,
capable of much extra milk
anyhow —so why worry?
Otheis again say it pays to
feed only the best producers
and let the rest go hang. Not
much help, when you want
guicknce.
Again, we are told that we-
should conserve fodder for
drought. Good advice, pro-
bably ; but what about the
economics of the question? If
a dry time comes and I can sell
my hay in the shed for £25 a
ton (which is what hay will
bring during drought in parts
of Australia) would it pay me
to sell the hay and let the cows
take a chance?
Some te u me that if you can

Others tell me that it pays

producing as soon as the rain
comes,” they say; “you will
get it back then.”
Who is right? Can someone

Every now and then Wallace
Skelsey, editor of the
highly regarded rural weekly
“Queensland Country Life,”
gets onto something so in-
teresting that his original
article is quoted or paraphrased
far and wide. An example a
few years back was a piece he
wrote on the Fairymead
cattle ; present writer, then
looking after these “M.0.L.”
pages, ran it here at length,
with appropriate acknowledg-
ments. The article was too
important to be ignored, and it
seemed impertinent to para-
phrase it.
One reason for these occa-
sional brilliant coups is that
-Mr. Skelsey is a firm believer
in “going to see for himself” ;
as he told me once, in Mel-
bourne, where I encountered
him on one of his fact-finding
expeditions. Although, no
doubt, he has the normal
editor's share of desk-work to
cope with, he does seem to
cover a lot of ground person-
all v. Lately, I see in “Queens-
land Country Life,” he has
been having a look at the
Goondiwindi (Q.) district.
“Despite State Government
disapproval,” Mr. Skelsey
writes, “perennial sorghum
(sorghum-almum) is now
widely used as a fodder-crop
in the Goondiwindi district.
Uusually it is sown on a well-
prepared seedbed, but in a
season like the present one
growth is such that stock
cannot effectively cope with it.”
Sorghum-almum, incident-
ally, is very much in the news
in north-w'estern N.S.W. Apart
from its virtues as fodder, it
has proved resistant to the
beetle-grub, which has done a
lot of harm over some 60,000
acres of pasture in the area.
Skelsey writes that work
done by J. H. Turner on his
property at Nornby, Goondi-
windi, engenders “visions of fat
cattle comparable with Argen-
tina’s best and an output to
keep pace with expanding
w'orld markets.”
“However,” he adds, “it
must remain nothing more than
a vision unless graziers are
assured of an economic return
for what they produce and are
given a form of land-tenure
which will encourage them
to work their land scientifi-
cally.”
The article continues:
Mr. Turner has evolved a system
of establishing sorghum-almum at
a cost of about 10s. an acre, which
makes it a most attractive grazing-
crop. Using a Graham-plough
drawn by a Ferguson, he ploughs
in one direction and on cross-
ploughing sows 61b. of seed per
acre. This has given satisfactory
establishment on various parts of
the 10,000-acre properly, pioneered
by the late F. C. Turner and once
part of the well-known Billa Billa
Scrub.
Purely as an experiment, 40 acres
in an old cultivation-paddock which
had not been worked for years was
given one working with the Graham-
plough and seed was dropped as it
went. Nothing could be more
economical than this. Germination
was patchy; it was best where the
tines were able to go down deepest.
Yet for grazing purposes, it is a
valuable source of green feed to
supplement the natural grasses.
Mr. Turner emphasises that what
he has done proves nothing at this
stage. However, it is promising
enough to warrant letting a con-
tract to clear 500 acres of rung
country for sowing to perennial
sorghum.
Probably the seed will be sown
in the ashes while giving one work-
ing with the Graham-plough. The
following year the paddock will be
cross-ploughed, and Mr. Turner is
confident that self-seeding will
result in an improvement in the
crop after each working.
The “State Department dis-
approval” mentioned is shared
by the N.S.W. Department, of
Agriculture, to the extent that
sorghum-almum is a prohibited
seed under the Seeds Act
(which means that merchants
cannot sell it), although it is not
a noxious weed. But, in fact,
it is being grown—fairly ex-
tensively in north-west N.S.W.
and, it seems, also in Queens-
land. So it is reasonable to
assume that someone is selling
seed. Not unnaturally, seed-
merchants have pointed out
that this is an odd state of
affairs. There is a demand for
the seed which cannot be satis-
fied through the normal
channels.
The departmental attitude,
however, is not a whimsical
one. Sorghum-almum is a
hybrid of Johnson-grass a
noxious weed and Sudan-
grass. In the first place, this
ancestry would be suspect, par-
ticularly in view of possible
cross-fertilisation with John-
son-grass in the paddock.
Also, early trials indicated
that sorghum-almum might
develop the sport-growth of
Johnson-grass, which would
make it difficult to eradicate
and a definite menace in, for
instance, good lucerne-
paddocks. However, it now
seems that this fear was un-
founded. Sports develop at an
early stage, but do not grow
to any dangerous extent.
A third, and more serious
objection, is that seed of
sorghum-almum and of John-
son-grass are almost identical
in appearance. So there is a
danger of Johnson-grass being
disseminated far and wide if
the sorghum-almum seed is re-
moved from the prohibited list.
That, at least, seems to be
the official attitude in N.S.W.
and Queensland.
Apart from the reference
quoted, Skelsey’s article does
not mention this background.
But there are some odd twists
to the situation in Queensland.
Department of Agriculture
agronomists privately com-
plain that, while the seed is on
the D. of A. prohibited list,
C.5.1.R.0. agronomists are
recommending it. Further, they
say, it was prohibited in the
first place on C.5.1.R.0. advice.
In the meantime, it seems
likely that the N.S.W. Depart-
ment of Agriculture, or some
similar body, will breed a
strain of sorghum-almum with
an easily-identlfiable seed, thus
removing the chief objection.
In the meantime, too, there
is abundant interest in any
system of establishing low-cost
fodder-crops. Mr. Turner’s
experiment will be worth
watching.

“C.A.A.”: J. H. Sutherland,
grazier from Yarck (Vic.), has
done it again—for the second
time he has won the Harislow
Cup for soil-conservation in
Victoria’s Upper Goulburn
catchment-area. He controlled
the stream-bank for miles
by tree-planting, contour-
furrowing and ripping, and
diversion-banks and grassed
chutes. He used vegetation to
control gullies. The 2400-acre
property has a carrying-rate
of 34 dry sheep to the acre,
largely as the result of this
programme. Sutherland’s other

Holding water by the soil is
most important. Yet he has

Where does the name “polo”
come from ? When and by whom
was the first game played ? What
was the date of the first inter-
national match ?
“Polo” comes from the Tibetan
word “pulu,” meaning “a ball.”
The game probably originated in
Persia before 500 b.c. ; it was being
played in China by the 7th century
a.d. ; in Turkey by the 11th century,
and in India by the 16th century.
In India, natives of Manipur con-
tinued to play it, and from them
it was adopted by the British Army
in 1863. It was first played in
England in 1869 by the 10th Hussars.
The first recorded international
match, between Persian and Turkish
teams, is described in the Shah-
nama by the 11th-century poet
Firdausi.

How to protect my
from mice ?
There have been many devices
for keeping these nuisances in
check. Building the stack upon
a raised platform is effective, pro-
vided the blocks upon which the
platform is built are capped with
galvanised-iron guards or inverted
petrol-tins. This is to stop the
mice reaching the platform-boards.
Another successful method is to
enclose the stack with a fence
of galvanised-iron, either plain or
corrugated, about 2ft. high. Force
the iron into the ground to a depth
of 4in. and place it in a slanting
position, leaning outwards, all
round the stock; take care to leave
no open space at the corners. To
ensure that mice keep away from
a stack thus protected, see that
"Boss, I'd like an outside job. I'm getting into
a kind of rut."
straws, bags or other articles are
not allowed to hang from the iron
fence or from the raised platform.

Who' designed the Sydney Harbor
Bridge ? Details of size, etc. ?
It was conceived by J. J. C. Brad-
field, who, as chief engineer of the
project on behalf of the N.S.W.
Government, decided what type of
bridge should be built and drew-
up the specifications. Subject to
the limitations of those specifica-
tions (as to span, headway above
the Harbor, position and breadth
of road- and rail-tracks and loads
to be carried), the design was made
by Sir Ralph Freeman, consulting-
engineer to the contractors, Dorman,
Long and Co., Ltd., of Middles-
brough, England.
The main span of the bridge is
1650 ft. long, and the length of the
main span and the steel approach-
spans is 3770 ft. Highest point of
the top chord is 440 ft. above mean
sea-level; greatest clearance for
shipping is 172 ft. 6in. at high water.
The arch is 60ft. deep at the crown
and 187 ft. deep at the bearings, and
is divided into 28 panels. Upper
and lower chords of the arch are
lift, wide throughout, the lower
chord tapering from a depth of Bft.
at the bearings to a depth of
4ft. at the crown. The main arch
is made of silicon steel and the
deck, of carbon steel, the total
weight of steel in the bridge being
51,900 tons. On each end of
the main span there are two granite-
faced concrete pylons, each 285 ft.
high to the top of its parapet.

New Recordings
Bartok and Kodaly
The two contemporary
Hungarian giants share this
Philips release (A 00353 L);
Bartok (1881-1945) is repre-
sented by “Music for Strings,
Percussion and Celesta,”
Kodaly (b. 1882) by the “Hary
Janos” suite. Both works are
played by the Amsterdam
Concertgebouw Orchestra,
under Eduard van Beinum.
This music of Bartok pre-
sents the reviewer with several
problems. Though at first hear-
ing one is unlikely to be over-
impressed, the music tends to
grow on you ; but its appeal is
objective, so that, while you
admire his brilliant scoring and
his unorthodox harmonic
tricks, ydu never r.eally feel
“in the thick of it” ; you often
do with Beethoven, and most
certainly with Tschaikowsky.
Bartok divides the “Music”
(the quotation-marks are not
intended derogatively) into
four movements. The first is
an andante tranquillo, interest-
ing from a student’s viewpoint
because the composer breaks
the rules —it’s a fugue on a
chromatic subject, and, in-
stead of having the second
voice entering a fifth higher,
Bartok makes the odd entries
come in a fifth higher and the
even entries a fifth lower ; the
number of keys traversed is
amazing. A thoughtful, some-
times pleasant, bit of writing,
finish the movement. SecOnd-
movement: Hary Janos and his
fiancee gaze open-mouthed at
a clock in the Imperial Palace
at Vienna. This is a brief,
sparkling movement, full of
side-drums and clock-measures.
In the next section Hary
Janos sings a love-song which
to have been inspired by
a peasant-gipsy melody. The
duel-movement, in which
Janos fights Napoleon, the
brass fight the drums, and the
piccolo fights the percussion, is
a little thin in texture, although
there is a good spot where the
trombones introduce a surly
melody which is later decorated
by trumpet fanfares.
The most fascinating move-
ment in the suite is undoubt-
edly the intermezzo, a lively
dance with a principal theme
which stirs the heart by fts
broken rhythm and passionate
scalal sweepings. One im-
portant thing emerges; Kodaly
sets the dominant-seventh free.
He uses it as a rubato pivot for
themal restatement —he doesn’t
glory in it, but uses it in exactly
the right place. One in the eye
for Beethoven.
The orchestra plays the
Kodaly very well, but there
are moments in the Bartok
when you feel they are a little
puzzled—although they never
go as far as they did on a
-recording of Britten’s “Varia-
tions on a Theme by Purcell,”
when, at the start of the fugue,
a flute lost itself.

Bruch
Someone once said, writing
of the Bruch Violin concerto in
G Minor, that the soloist must
mix his heart’s-blood with the
resin. Wolfgang Schneiderhan,
on D.G.G. 17028 LPE, does
just that. The marvellous
slow movement is poig-
nantly handled ; and the brisk
final movement, which is
almost as well known as the
last movement of the Beet-
hoven ‘Moonlight” Sonata,
becomes a thing of graceful
flexibility, but is perhaps a
too-jovial foil to the tears of
the previous movement. Ferdi-
nand Leitner conducts the
Bamberg Symphony Orchestra;
and the recording is out of the
top drawer.

A Little Gem
Here’s a seven-inch 33|
Coronet, featuring pieces taken
from-two 12in. L.P.S—Elgar’s
“Pomp and Circumstance
March No. 1” (yes, the “Land
of Hope and Glory” one),
Paganini’s “Moto Perpetuo”
and Purcell’s “Trumpet Volun-
tary.” Probably the most
interesting of the three is the
Paganini ; originally a solo
piece, it’s done here by the
Philadelphia Orchestra, and the
arrangement is by Eugene
Ormandy, who also conducts.
It is, of course, little more than
a musical curiosity ; but it’s a
fascinating curiosity, and
Ormandy’s arrangement is skil-
ful, particularly with regard to
the horn scoring. The other
pieces, performed by the same
orchestra and conductor, are
of the same high standard;
'there is some tremendous
trumpet-playing in the Purcell.
but there is a dark brooding
element pretty close all the
time.
The next movement, an
allegro, is starkly explosive,
with plenty of syncopation and
with piano and celesta out-
bursts. Sometimes the piano
just plays the same chord time
after time —a section like this
appears to owe something to
Saint-Saens. It would be silly
to say any of this music would
provide soothing relaxation
after, say, a nerve-tearing day
at the office ; except for odd
moments the pale watery
shadows of the adagio, for
example, or the unrestrained
drum-figuration in the fast
final movement —the music is
principally valuable as a
pointer to Bartok's style.
But Kodaly’s suite, centring
on a Hungarian fairytale
character who is a terrific
storyteller, is almost opposite
in its effect. There are six
fairly short movements ; each
has plenty of color, and, if you
follow the legend of Hary
Janos printed on the record-
jacket, there are quite a few
humorous touches.
Kodaly starts with a swirling
fortissimo flourish, but he’s
really fooling; straight after
this the strings slide around
softly, gradually becoming
more confident, until there’s a
brief climax ; then, surprisingly,
a mere few bars of solo oboe

One of the happiest moments of the
year for members of the Robin Hood
committee came on Friday night, when
their president, Mrs. James Alston,
handed-over a cheque for £2OOO to help
provide residential accommodation at
centres established by the Helping Hand
Association for mentally-retarded child-

country —at Bairnsdale and Traralgon—
and another seven cater for suburban
children. The money represents a year’s
work by the committee, which has now
raised £6500 since it was established a
few years ago.
With such good reason for a party,
gaiety was the keynote of the night when
Mrs. Alston (attractive in gold-spotted
black tie-silk) welcomed more than 200
guests at Union House. She was helped
by joint-secretaries Francine Abry and
Mabel Lincoln (the former’s cocktail-

Plenty of joy this week for both the
young and their elders who have retained
a love of toys. (Does anyone outgrow
a love of dolls or the male absorption
with trains?) The Toy Fair of 1959, to
be officially opened today (Wednesday,
May 20) by Lady Brooks, promises to
give many an enchanted hour to viewers,
also a substantial lift to funds of both
the Royal Children’s and the Queen Vic-
toria hospitals and, Yooralla School for
Crippled Children, all of which have
been allotted stalls. Organised by the
Toy Retailers’ Association of Victoria to
publicise the growth of the industry, only
British and Australian manufacturers
were invited to exhibit at the fair, which
is at the Exhibition Building for a week.

The first exhibition of the Hand-
weavers and Spinners’ Guild of Victoria
is attracting much interest, especially
among organisations which have taught
their members these ancient crafts. While
most weavers have been content to make
articles for everyday use, such as table-
mats, scarves apd dress-lengths, the mem-
bers of the guild have been much more
ambitious. Their display includes a soft
Navajo rug of red, gold and white, bright
tapestry wall-hangings and rugs of
Indian patterns, as well as men’s ties,
weskits and pullovers. The exhibition
is at the National Gallery for a fortnight,
and was opened officially by well-known
weaver Miss Rachel Grieve, who wore
a frock of rpaterial hand-woven by one
of her students who is blind.

Original and refreshing variety has been
given to theatre-entertainment by the
coming to the Comedy of “The World of
Cilli Wang.” A large first-night audience
was completely captivated on Friday by
the whimsical and lovable little Viennese.
Although her business is to make people
laugh, in doing so she brings to the stage
much of the genius of Chaplin and the
same dash of pathos blending with the
humor.
Among those who went away debating
as to which was Cilli and which the puppet
in several of her acts were Sir Arthur and
Lady Smithers (she in silver-grey studded
organza), Lady Tait (her black velvet
frock studded with “gold and of short
length), Dr. and Mrs. Ray Shatin (she in a
lovely embroidered-silk dress and match-
ing coat), Mr. and Mrs. Royden Honey-
man, (the latter in a stunning full-length
dress of silver Other noted
first-nighters were Mrs. Geoffrey Tolson,
Mrs. Leo Guest, Mrs. E. Kirwan, and
Mrs. A. J. Fraser, wife of the Victorian
Minister for Development.

Members of the English-Speaking
Union welcomed at their clubrooms last
week Mrs. Guy Franklin, who has just
spent a year at Bangkok on a Fulbright
Fellowship. The visitor,, who is staying
with Mr. and Mrs. L. Q. Permezel at


their Caulfield home, has an impressive
academic background, which includes an
M.A. degree, doctoral work in linguistics
at Michigan University, and at lowa
University in television-techniques, as
well as teacher of English at several
universities. Mrs. Franklin is a past-vice-
president of the Virginia branch of the
E.-S.U. After a short stay in Melbourne
she will leave for Tasmania.
SYDNEY
School-holidays, and the streets of
Sydney are livefter and prettier for the
presence of so many young things on
shopping-sprees with their mothers. Ihe
social-calendar is rather blank because
so many people have said in the early-
planning stages of things, “Oh, don’t
have it that week. It’s school-holidays!”
The shop-windows are showing little-
girl dresses, of course, and it’s interest-
ing to note how all the smartest styles
feature the long-waisted, narrow look.
Double-breasted coats and slim, pleated
skirts are more and more replacing the
bunchy type of dress for littlies, and
the kilt with , its smooth front is gain-
ing ground on the all-round-fullness
skirt. Youngsters’ styles always reflect
grown-up fashions (even in the ’eighties
little girls wore little bustles), so it
seems inevitable that the slim line will
win over the bouffant eventually.
Not much special provision seems to
have been made for the children in the
entertainment line. “The Mouseketeers”
at the Stadium, of course, were the chief
attraction, but otherwise the only show
for them is a programme of old Charlie
Chaplin films at one of the newsreel
theatres. Unless you count a show called
“Teenage Wolf Pack” at another
picture-house!

Sydney has never had more interesting
places at which to wine and dine—or to
espresso and dine —than it has at present.
They crop-up under intriguing names —
like The Hungry Horse —from the
northern beaches to around the slum-
fringe of the city and King’s Cross. “The
Cross” itself still leads in number and
variety; and on Monday of last week
there was the happy reappearance of
George Chomentowski, in partnership
with John Dlugolecki, as hosts at Chez
George, where delectable food was
served at a party held to celebrate the
opening of the restaurant in the building
previously occupied by the Dorchester, in
the quiet end of Macleay Street. George
used to conduct the Adria in King's

The Far West Children’s Health
Scheme is to spend £90,000 in extending
its premises at Manly, it was announced
at the annual meeting held at the
week. At present there are as many
children waiting to be admitted to the
Home as are in residence, but it is hoped
that the new extensions will bring its
benefits to all the youngsters needing
them. A public appeal for £25,000 is to
be launched, chairman N. W. Drum-
mond told the meeting, and the annexe
will be named after the late Dr. Mon-
crieff Barron, who had done so much
for the Home. Lady Woodward opened
the conference, and the guest-speakers
were Sir William Morrow and Dr. John
Kempson Maddox. A special feature
of the opening session was the presenta-
tion of an estate-car by Mrs. Betty
Muzyczuk (for the 2PK Sunshine Club)
to Lady Woodward, who accepted it on
behalf of the Far West Children’s Health
Scheme.

in popularity. Last week’s speaker
was Mr. George Baker, well-known TV-

Very human note struck in the delight-
ful biography of Elizabeth of the Ger-
man Garden, recently published. When
Elizabeth (an Australian whose maiden
name was Mary Anne Beauchamp) was
being courted in 1889 by the glamorous
Baron Von Arnim, who invited princes
and princesses to meet her and all the
rest of it, her mother noted, “I get con-
stant letters from my sister. All she can
say about May is she is glad it is not
one of her girls.” Doubtless envious
aunts will be saying the very same thing
70 years hence as they are today.


best and worst: the charming lyricism
that so easily dissolves into feyness
and sentimentality ; the sharp insight
that so easily dissolves into platitude.
One would like to see a good produc-
tion of it. Some of the scenes are
difficult to grasp in print, but a skilful
director might draw out their signifi-
cance by careful arrangement. and
pacing of the actor's movements. In
fact the whole play contains sugges-
tions of ballet —a ballet related in
some ways to jazz, with its mixture
of banality and unstudied poetry.
Besides stating Saroyan’s artistic
position, the preface describes where
and how he wrote this play and “The
Time of Your Life.” This and the
note on “Opening Nights I Have
Known” are glimpses into Saroyan’s
personal world, which, though situated
at more than a slight angle to the uni-
verse, is always refreshing. There is
also an imaginary interview with
“Anybody,” in which the playwright
defends himself against the charge of
not having “bad guys” in his plays,
and vaguely compares his art to
Mozart’s.
Talks by Gerald Durrell
Nobody writes more pleasantly about
animals than Gerald Durrell; and in
Encounters with Animals (Hart Davis;
Angus and Robertson) he continues to
write so pleasantly that he almost
makes us forget we are reading the
scripts of broadcast talks.
There is nothing wrong with the
broadcast talk as such; but, because a
conversational style is generally a bit
thin, they don’t usually read well. In
“Encounters with Animals” you do
miss the feeling of being far away in
wild and delectable places which
Durrell conveys so attractively in the
books that have made him famous.
You are constantly coming back to
earth for the next broadcast. But even
in this form you do spend quite a time
in Africa, - for example, when the
hippopotami are fighting for love or
when, under the wild fig-tree, Durrell
watches the procession of birds and
animals that come to feast on the fruit
or on each other: first the huge birds
called plantain-eaters, then the troops
of monkeys calling “oink oink” as the
branches under their weight “swish
and roar like giant waves on a beach,”
then the hornbills which always keep
the monkeys company and' eat very
delicately with their enormous bills,
then the little striped mice which come
to eat the fruit which the monkeys
have dropped, then the weasel-like
genet which pounces on the mice; and
then, in a lunchtime interval, Jhe
shrew-mouse which, “like a miniature
black hound,” tracked and leapt upon
a giant snail:—
Chittering to himself, the shrew
trotted rapidly after the snail and
very soon overtook it. Uttering a
high-pitched squeak, it flung itself on
that portion of the snail which pro-
truded from vthe rear of the shell
and sank its teeth into it. The
snail, finding itself so suddenly and
unceremoniously attacked from the
rear, did the only possible thing
and drew its body rapidly back inside
its shell....As soon as the shrew's
head was pushed into the opening of
the shell it was greeted by a sudden
fountain of greenish-white froth
that bubbled out and enveloped nose
and head. The shrew leapt back
with surprise. .. .almost incoherent
with rage, sneezing violently and
trying to wipe the froth from its
face with its paws.
It is a little disconcerting to find
Durrell, so excellent an observer in
the. field, digging-up a few facts out
of books for these talks (about the
satin bower-bird, for instance): and it
doesn’t seem quite in keeping for him
to do some of his observing in zoos.
But, then, one of the zoos was Whip-
snade, which is not like other zoos;
and, giving him every right 'to write
about it, Durrell worked there for a
while: and here hb saw the courtship
of tigers and, at night, pausing to greet
the bears as he passed, he took the
feeding-bottles to the baby Pere David
deer, which, once the pampered targets
of the emperors of China, were all
drowned in their native land when the
Hun-Ho River flooded the Imperial
Hunting Park, and survive now only
in the descendants of the herd which
the father of the present Duke of
Bedford preserved on his estate at
Woburn.
In short, if the book is not quite
Durrell at his best, it is still very good
Durrell; and it deals with crabs that
turn sulky and, tired of being tor-
mented, allow themselves to be bitten
in half by raccoons; and boxing tree-
porcupines; and a cayman that for
weeks on end tried to devour a lily-
trotter. or jacana. in a lagoon in South
America, and how Durrell circum-
vented it; and weaver-birds tying knots
to hang their nests from the branches;
and electric-eels which, apparently,
can shock you, without contact, from
a foot away; and the dodo, which, if
dead, is a useful bird to know about if
you are going on a quiz-session; and
how Sarah, the author’s pet ant-eater,
which he brought home from Para-
guay, behaved at the Royal Festival
Hall; and how Pavlo, his black-eared
marmoset, lived for eight years “like
a leprechaun” in his house, using the
picture-rails as his highways, diving
ecstatically into the jam-jars and end-
lessly feuding with the big white cat
from next door, which, though he
swore at hen insisted on regarding him
as a rat; and many other birds, beasts
and insects, some beautiful and all, in
Durrell's inimitable style, amusing.
SOME WORDS IN SPRING
In spring this girl in summer dress
Stands by the river bank, alone,
The short grass crushed beside her.
“Tell me,” she cries, “do I love less
Since he loves me, has our love grown
Not deeper, joined, but wider?
Gootlbye, farewell, my sweet,
You have my heart to keep
Sure, sound, until we meet
And is it light therefore?
“Am I, who do not feel despair,
' Are you, whose hands will find me warm,
Both shallow like this river
That does not rage, that no rocks tear,
Where ducklings can ride out a storm
And only the wind makes shiver?
Who should know what l mean
But you with whom I've lain
On grass of different green,
A long time my true lover.”
Two swans sail gently up to her.
Query the water with their necks,
With hisses second her sighing,
“All famous lovers should deter
Me from such joy of soul and sex ;
They say deep love is dying,
Torn, betrayed, untrue,
But I hold what I know.
Whatever others do
We live by our own doing."

James Joyce
In Our Friend James Joyce
(Gollancz) Mary and Padraic Colum
look casually back at their thirty-odd
years of friendship with Joyce, prompt-
ing each other along the track of
memory, quietly recognising and
accepting his faults, gently extolling
his virtues and warmly admiring his
work. The result is an engaging im-
pression of the man as he appeared
at parties, dinners and railway-
stations, in streets, pubs, restaurants
and libraries, as host, guest and family-
man.
The book falls into two parts —the
first set in Dublin before Joyce’s
“exile”; the second in Paris after the
Trieste-Zurich period. The Dublin
part, since it places Joyce firmly in
the world of his books and gives a
fresh idea of the incredible detail with
which he recreated that world, is by
far the more interesting. The Paris
part —except for the fine closing chap-
ters, where World War II and Joyce’s


death approach together, with the
suggestion of an epoch ending—reads
very much like all the other notes on
life among the expatriates in the
’twenties and ’thirties.
Padraic Colum helped Joyce to
prepare the manuscript of “Finnegans
Wake,” so he can’t resist giving foot-
notes on the local Irish allusions in it.
None of these is very helpful to the
non-Irish reader: their obscurity
merely discourages, and they make the
regionalism of Joyce’s writing seem
more important than it really is.
But the book is full of striking
pictures. There is Joyce as the remote
and rather arrogant undergraduate
who, with Oliver St. John Gogarty,
was compiling an anthology of inscrip-
tions from the walls of Dublin’s public
lavatories and had already written a
pamphlet condemning the provin-
cialism of the young National Theatre;
Joyce at a party, strutting with hat
and cane and singing “The Man Who
Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo” in
his fine tenor; his return from Italy
with Italian workmen to start Ireland’s
first cinemas; his abortive meeting
with Proust (Proust named several
aristocrats. Joyce said he didn’t know
them, and that was that); his gay
encounter with Marlene Dietrich in a
Paris restaurant; his drunken over-
tipping of a line of waiters, and Mary
Colum retrieving most of the money
because she knew his family needed
it; his aversion to violence and lack
of curiosity about it which made it
impossible for him to write about
crime (“Birth and death are sufficiently
violent for me”); and his wife Nora,
who seldom read his work and did not
understand much of it when she did,
and made a comment on it which must
go into any anthology of understate-
ments: “Don’t you think Jim is making
things very difficult for himself by
writing the way he does?”
Off-rhymes
May I join in? After all. it was my
off-rhyming that was the unlucky
guinea-pig in “D.S.’s” Red Page
demonstration (25/3/’59) of his theory
about this kind of practice in poetry,
and I gather that Frederick T.
Macartney (Red Page 22/4/’59),
although he is willing enough to let
me and others off-rhyme as we will,
considers the practice something of a
source of amusement.
The subject of off-rhymes is import-
ant, complicated and fascinating, and
I would like to add at least to its com-
plication by attempting to present my
own view on it.
First of all, enjoy it though I may,
I mostly find the writing of poetry
dashed hard work —a struggle either
to hang on to the concept and the
mood while engaged with the form they
can demand, or (and this is the creepy
part) to seize on the spirits of unfore-
seen dimensions or changes of concept
which the weird alchemy of mood and
form can give off, and incarnate them.
Since the constant factor in both
these courses of battle —which may
overlap—is mood, at all times I am
concerned with the melodic line which
is its proof and which has to sustain
it. If the melodic line breaks down
and can’t be repaired, then the mood
is gone, the concept caves in, the poem
is a flop. All I have left is meaningless
form.
I think I can now say that though
I may on occasions (and perhaps they
are too often!) use an off-rhyme
unsuccessfully, I never do so lazily. In
my attention to the melodic line I am,
naturally, occupied with sound, and
off-rhyming may be just the thing
needed to remove the emphatic same-
ness of ring at the end of lines.
Such a sameness in my opinion has
a tendency to set the mind dreaming
in a rocking-chair and looking snugly
ahead to the kind of strike it expects
next —somewhat or much to the exclu-
sion or blurring of the image or reflec-
tion that lies between the strikes. Too
frequently mechanical sound-for-sound
rhymes repeatedly beating in a poem
are not a delight but merely a satisfac-
tion. Even a jingle can be satisfying.
In other words, providing it isn’t
inharmonious (to me) and providing
it is “there,” I don’t hesitate to use an
off-rhyme as an artifice to attract or
edge the reader into a poem from the
margins of its form. The reader antici-
pates a certain full sound; I halve the
sound on him (hence “road-stood”) and
hope to God he wakes up and sees
there is more to the poem than a com-
fortable rhyme and time.
Which brings me to another aspect
of off-rhyming. The time of a poem
is bound up in the values of syllables
—somewhere near the equivalent of
musical notes —and if a syllable con-
tains a long vowel, then the pause
upon it will be correspondingly long,
comparable in music to the length of
time devoted by rule to a quaver once
the crochet has been measured.
Now, in order to vary or enrich the
poem’s time, there seems no earthly
reason why I shouldn’t alter the value
of a syllable in rhyming by shortening
or lengthening its vowel according to
the measure of the vowel of the
syllable I have chosen for its mate in
a preceding line. Quite remarkable
effects in movement and rhythm can
be obtained in this way.
The one condition —and a true ear
will keep the poet firmly to it is
that the character of the sound should
not be changed so much that it is com-
pletely incompatible with the earlier
sound it is meant to complement; in
which case both off-rhyming words
would collapse together, jarring the
sense, ruining the melody of the whole
poem. For example, the pairing-of
“loop” and “drip” may well prove
catastrophic. “Loop” and “drop,”
however, might be persuaded to go
very effectively together.
Pairs of sounds in off-rhyming com-
plement each other through each’s
distinctive musical tone, and tone
embodies pitch, strength and reson-
ance —which might be described as a
spoken syllable’s power graduated in
terms of audible time. Consider the
different yet handsomely suited tones
of “home” and “come,” two words
which can be made to off-rhyme rather
beautifully. (They also, by the way,
constitute a perfectly permissible
“sight” rhyme, as do “cattle” and
“wattle”!)
“Home” has the slightly higher
natural speech pitch; it is softer, deeper
and can command a larger volume; its
sound lingers longer in the corridors
of the head after the mouth has closed
upon it. “Come,” pitched lower, is
shorter, harder, but it easily accepts
some of the color and vibration of
“home” when placed near to it, and
offers in return something of its own
qualities of firmer fibre and better
bounce.
As we hear a word, so do we think
it, and I can’t subscribe to the theory
that any pair of rhyming words can,
in the reader’s mind, to an extent each
affect the pitch of the other. “D.S.”
states that the rhyming of “sun” with
“ban” would cause “sun” to sound a
little like “san” and “ban” to sound
a little like “bun.” If this were true,
the best-possible of off-rhyming
couples would never be mutually com-
plementary—only abominable, drawn
into a discordancy of sharps and flats.
Our ears surely are subtle and intelli-
gent enough to admit each off-rhyme
sound in its own fullness and at its own
individual pitch. If our ears are not,
then we won’t be able to appreciate
the harmony of good off-rhyming at
all. Instead, we will probably seek
convenient refuge among the ranks of
those die-hards who are opposed to
off-rhyming merely on the grounds
that it hasn’t always been the fashion
—“as if there could be fashion in
poetry; such an idea degrades the art
to the level of a dressmaker’s-shop,”
Edith Sitwell has said.
