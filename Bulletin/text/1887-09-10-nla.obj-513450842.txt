The Barristers’ Monopoly.
Although as a community New South Wales
has just reason to pride herself on the general
consistency of her institutions with pure
demociatic ideas, there still exist a few
effete remnants of old conservative traditions
which remain untouched by the billows of
the on-rushing democracy. Sofar as these are
concerned their existence is due solely to the
fact that they play no vital part of opposition
to the true spirit of the colony. In a
general sense the country’s path is still on-
ward to the fuller democratic ideal. We say
in a general sense because in New South
Wales there is one profession so barred about
by monopoly and fenced in by privilege as
to form an evil and striking exception. We
allude, of course, to the legal profession.
There are many crying anomalies in con-
nection with the lower branch of the pro-
fession, but it is with some of the strange
and impudent assumptions of the so-called
upper branch, as they are indicated in the
rules for admission to the New South Wales
Bar, that we now propose to deal.
* * *
Some ten years ago the first Barristers’
Admission Board, consisting of Martin,
Faucett, Manning, Dalley, Barley, and
Foster formulated, under an act of Parlia-
ment, certain rules for the admission of
barristers. These rules may be considered
as framed in a tolerably fair spirit, if we
except three provisions they contained. The
first of these objectionable provisoes related
to the examination fees exacted from the can-
didates. These, in the aggregate, amounted,
and still amount, to £so—an exorbitant sum
for the State to extort from a man on his
entrance into the profession by which he
expects to subsist. How many non-lawyers
are there, great and honoured in English
history for their intellectual achievements,
who never had such a sum of money in their
possession at any one time, and who would,
consequently, have be en prevented from reach-
ing the Bar of New South Wales had they
lived in this favoured clime under the dis-
pensation at present existing ? Bad as this
is, it was surpassed by a second disability
which provided that when the aspirant to
the Bar passed his initial examination he
had to undergo a novitiate ranging from
twelve months to three years before admis-
sion to his second or final examination.
Having been charged in money, the
candidate was now to be charged in
time. No reason was advanced for this,
simply because no reason existed. In other
countries the examinations in the various
subjects are simultaneous, and by this means
the operation is considerably shortened.
Tfiere can be no reason why a man should
not be admitted to the Bar as soon as he is
fit to go to it but the very sinister one that,
having a good fat monopoly in their hands,
the Barristers’ Admission Board, and through
them the Bar itself, wish to make the way
as difficult as possible to those who desire to
share in the plunder. The harassing effect
of this disabling provision was heightened by
a third rule to the effect that during this
period of ’ probation the embryo barrister
should pursue no occupation besides study-
ing for his profession other than in the
nature of a literary pursuit. As there are
very fVw men at, or aspiring to, the Bar who
could make a decent living at literary work,
it followed that tne rule practically amounted
to a provision enacting that during his novi-
tiate the candidate should be a gentleman at
large, with at least sufficient means to keep
him in idleness for 12 months.
♦ * ft
This latter provision needs no comment.
Taken in conjunction with those preceding,
it plainly indicated the intention of keeping
the Bar for the sons of the wealthy. The
concession allowing candidates to follow a
literary pursuit was perhaps a sop to the
power of the Press ; but more probably it
arose from some lingering feelings of respect
which Martin and I) alley felt for the pro-
fession they had themselves not unsuccess-
fully followed in their younger and more
vigorous days. It might be imagined that
these rulws were restrictive enough even for
so conservative a profession as the Bar
notoriously has ever been. The assumption
of the power to say what a man’s occupa-
tion shall or shall not be is one of the most
arbitrary imaginable. If a man spent bis
time burning bones, or came, like Cincin-
natus, fresh from the plough, with the
scent of the newly-turned soil hanging to
his clothes, what would that have to do with
his qualification for the Bar if only his head
were crammed with its quips and quibbles to
the extent deemed necessary.
• * *
With the disappearance of Dalley from
the Board, the death of Martin, and the
accession of Darley to the Chief Justice-
ship came a new departure. The present
Roman-faced Chief Justice has always been
as great a Conservative as if the bluest
blood of the biggest Norman butcher who
came over to England with William the
Bastard coursed through his veins. The
rules were not Conservative enough for him
in the state above described, and new re-
gulations were promptly made, extend-
ing the term of probation to three
years, and striking out the provision
allowing the candidate to support him-
self by literary labour, .As the rules
now stand, the aspirant to the Bar must
pay his fee of fifty guineas to the
examiners, and remain for a period of three
years dependant on his private fortune.
This summarily disposes of any ambitious
man of limited means who dares to fix his
eye on the Bar of New South Wales, and
hands that profession over finally to the
curled darlings of fortune whose sires possess
fat banking accounts and mansions near Sir
Frederick Barley’s at Edgecliffe Road, or
in some equally aristocratic location. The
provision excluding law students from fol-
lowing a literary pu> suit whilst reading for
the Btir is a curious one. It is needless to
say that it does not exist in England or Ire-
land, or France, and, as far as we know, New
South Wales is the only country in the world
where such a rule is enforced. Had it been
the case “ at home ” some of the brightest
ornaments of the English and Irish Bar
would never have become lawyers. Some
of these are men who would have left a per-
manent imprint upon the literature of their
country had they adhered to a literary occu-
pation, and whose traces even now are far
from faint. Many law students and young
barristers, both in England and Ireland,
have been glad and proud to supplement
incomes by writing for the Press, and per-
haps even the masterful Sir Frederick him-
self, when he was a sucking barrister hanging
about the Four Courts of Dublin, would have
been very glad to do the same. The will to
write an article for the Press must, however,
be backed up by something more—the power
—and we trust that no early failures in this
direction have embittered the Chief Justice
against the liteiary profession. Of Mr. Jus-
tice Innes no such thing as sympathy with
the literary profession could bo expected,
and it is highly satisfactory to that profes-
sion that ho has displayed none. He has
now at least the credit of being sincere.
Judge Faucett has done many better things
in his career than assenting to these new
rules, and his conduct is - a disappointment.
Obstinate and irrational as the late Chief
Justice was in many of his views regarding
the Press, no such jule would have passed
in his lifetime. He knew too well, and
was indeed himself a striking example of the
remarkable efficacy of a training on the
Press for the legal profession. The habits
of clear, logical, and systematic thought, ex-
pressed in concise and lucid phraseology,
with the faculties of perception and order for
which, ai an advocate and a judge, he wai so
remarkable, are essential qualifications
in every good leader-writer; and if
every member of the New South Wales
Bar possessed these powers, the business of
the Courts would be transacted much more
speedily, and the addresses of advocates
shorn of much of their useless verbosity. It
is not our intention to slight the literary
profession by instituting a comparison be-
tween it and that of law, and we presume
that even the self-assurance of Mr. Justice
Inner is unequal to the assertion that there
is anything mentally deteriorating in a
literary pursnit. Why then are students-at-
law debarred from following such a pursuit ?
M-ny barristers are glad to follow it and
augment their professional incomes by con-
tributing to the columns of the Sydney Press
whenever opportunity offers. By what
peculiar force of reasoning is that made
right and decorous for a man who has already
a highly protect&d means of livelihood, and
forbidden to him who is merely struggling
to gain that profession ? We think the
cause rests in that miserable spirit of Con-
servatism which marks the action of at least
Chief Justice Barley and one of his col-
leagues. It is the spirit of the miser who,
the more gold he has stowed away in his
chest, the greater grows his lust for an
increase. Beyond all right, beyond all
reason, the Bar was protected previously,,
and it wanted but this straw to break
down the long-suffering of the people who
have so patiently submitted to this bloated
monopoly for such a lengthened period.
The iniquity of the rules for admission to
the Bar are increased by the reflection that
lisping nonentities from England and Ire-
land may and do come to Australia in
flocks, and are admitted without question
or difficulty, while it may be that men of
high character and sterling intellectual
powers, because they are natives of the
colony, are shut out by the gang of lawyers
from other countries, who hold the chief
positions here and use their power to plot
politically and otherwise against the native-
born Australian. Not only are Australians
not encouraged, but bs will be seen by what
we have pointed out they are actually pro-
hibited, while shoals of incompetents from
other places are encouraged to come here
and usurp the positions, properly (he prize
of tt e Australian —a noble instance, surely, of
Freetrade ! Parliament will not do its duty
if a single session is allowed to pass before
some means are taken to rectify this dis-
graceful anomaly ; and if, when the mono-
poly of the legal profession is attacked, the
blow levelled at the root of the tree should be
a vengeful one, those only will be to blame
who forced the insolence of monopoly past
the bounds of human patience.
PLAIN ENGLISH
The Prospectors’ Reward.
They have a tine old Conservative dislike towards
prospectors for gold in the region around Moreo,
N.S W. Up that way, of course, anybody not a
sheep or cattle grazier is looked upon as a
pariah, fit only to be cast out of the d strict into
the “less happier lands” where squatterdom
does not reign supreme. A squatter in that part
discovered, the other day, a trio of enterprising
argonauts industriously raking the gullies hereto-
fore sacred to his flocks and herds in search of the
precious. He scented danger to his intere* ts from
afar off, and, having certain suspicions, set
earnestly to work with the object of ridding his
station of the invaders. The. hut of the diggers
was searched, and 1510. of salted meat found in
a cask. Some distance off the skull of a calf was
discovered. This was enough. The unfortunate
men were dragged into Moree and charged with
havh g meat in their possession fpp which they
could not yield a satisfactory account. The
butcher who supplied the diggers came forward
and made a plain statement to thie effect that the
meat in question was part, of what he had sold to
the accused a week or, so previously, but the
squatter's men said they had missed a calf, and
accordingly the bench fined the diggers £7O and
costs, with the option of four months' hard.labour.
Not having the £7O, and the c6sts, which, aggre-
gated about £lO more, the poor devils ha(i to go
off to gaol. The Moree people are not a little in
dignant at the result. The diggers, they say, are
remarkably honest men, natives of that
part of the country, atcl favourably known
to many as industrious and plodding and deserving
men. They talk of appealing to Attorney-General
Wise, and all that sort of thing. But surely they
must be not much superior intellectually to Jus-
tice Innes’ “gullible dolts,” if they suppose there
is any chance of redress in appealing to the Crown
Law Department. About the time* these victims
of justices’ justice have performed their four,,
months in prison, an answer will be forthcoming
from the Attorney-General or his successor to
the effect that the matter will be duly investi-
gated and reported cn, and a few months after
the men have completed their term they
will doubtless be informed that they ape
“pardoned” for an oflVnca they never com-
mitte4, A fine country, N.IR. Wales, fpr gold,pro-
spectors. Like all other native industries, the
search for mineral wealth is being warmly en-
couraged by Parkes, Burns, and Wise. If
things go on much more in the direction of
developing the resources of the laud under the
Freetrade methods, no doubt by and by we shall
have countless gold-diggers—in the asylums for
the destitute or the gapls. As fer having any at
work, that is a condition outside the desiderata
the Freetrade gang have set themselves to pro-
duce. Give t,hem squatters and calico jimmies in
fair numbers, and ihsy are content for the rest
with a strong body of police and a few hired
magistrates.
The Wealth of New South Wales.
We have kept this item waiting for nearly three
weeks, so that Parkes might enjoy his holiday at,
Adelaide undisturbed, but the time has come
when be must either explain himself or go to.
grass. As he has never yet been known to explain
himself on any subject, from the beauty of truth
down to the purchase of the A.S.N. wharf —other-
wise than by calling the man who wants the
explanation a mole eyed deg stealer—the prospect
is not a brilliant one, and the chances aie that the
grand old mistake will merely retort by saying
that somebody told him we set fire to our grand-
mother out in Siam, but still we lay our case
before the Kiama Ghost in a friendly spirit, and
await developments. In the course of his racent
anti-DiBBS oration at Glen Innes, Sir Henry un-
burdened his soul of the following remarkable
utterances
“ He would now tell them how well we could afford to pay
this debt and pay this interest, and how capable we were of
constructing more railways should we decide upon doing it.
The public wealth i f this country—the real solid assets of the
Gov rument in the ahap? of railways, public works, and
public lands—amounted to £170,160,000. The municipalities
had an addition to the public works which might fairly be
estimated at £4,968,000. This showed that we had the
wealth in the country quite equal to our necessity. We need
not therefore be restrained by any timidity; nor need we
fear any disastrous consequences in undertaking public
works so long as our position was thus solid. (Cheers )
Now, in regard to the private wealth of our million of people.
They had ascertained that the value of the lands and houses
within and outside the municipal districts, of live stock,
growing crops, furniture and personal effects, machinery,
coin and bullion, merchandise and thipplng, owned in the
colony was £346,250,000 So that the public and private
wealth of the colony was £521,00,0000, or £520 19s. 4cj. for
every man, woman, and child in the country. (Cheers.) ”
The national wealth of New South Wales, ac-
cording to Parkes, is thus £520 19s. per inhabi-
tant. On the principle of Mr. Mantalini, we
dem the fourpence. And yet when we turn
to Pulsfobd’s pamphlet, “Freedom in New
South W ales v, Oppression in Victoria,” we learn
that in 1882 the total was exactly £241 per head,
and we ask in all humility whether Parkes is
prepared to bet his little brown petticoat that it
has more than doubled in the course of five years
If it has, then New South Wales has been advanc-
ing, in spite of the apparent stagnation of trade,
as no country has ever advanced before; and if
the next 35 years are accompanied by the same
outward symbols of poverty, the result will be
that every man, woman, and child in the land
will be worth £64,000. Consequently our next-
door neighbour, whose family numbers seven in
all and whose only visible assets are a tortoise-
shell kitten and a picture of the raising of
L.izarus, can count confidently cn £448,000 as
hig share, and with this-in view, he needn't get up
to split the wood so early in the morning. But if,
on the other hand, Sir Henry is not prepared to
prove that New South Wales is advancing ac this
tearit gpace, he might kindly explain wr a- he is
driving at. Either somebody is a stupendous liar,
trading on garbled figures and distorted facts, or
el ie N.S.W. will shortly be possessed of more
wealth than the world has ever seen, and will hold
a bill of sale over the whole earth. Unless Parkes
eases up, in short, he will consign the whole of
four continents to insolvency, while Australia
will break its back in its efforts to carry its own
wealth. Perhaps, on the whole, he had better
ease up. We do not value wealth for its own
sake, and if he will knock even £lOO off that
£520 19s. 4d. he will thereby considerably diminish
the oppressive celerity of our progress, and let
other nafons down a good deal easier. As mat-
ters stand Parkes’ ostentatious rashness bids fair'
to involve New South Wales in utter ruin. When !
Hezekiah, then newly recovered from his boil,
showed his riches to the ambassadors from Baby-
lon he brought down a swarm of enemies to plun
dtr the fair land of Judah, and yet even he was
not mad enough to assure his visitors and the'
public generally that his defenceless subjects had'
£520 19s. Id. a-piece. But then, of course, they
hadn’t got it, and for that matter the people o V
New South Wales haven’t got it either.

The D.T. and Abigail.
The Sydney D.T. pretends to occupy a high moral 1
standpoint in its criticisms of public men and
public affairs. For prevarication and double-
dealing it professes the utmost abhorrence and the-
profoundest contempt. For even the milder
forms of tergiversation it habitually expresses un-
bounded condemnation, and is satisfied with*
nothing short of absolute rectitude and candour
on the part of politicians and publicists. It is*
noticeable, however, that the DT. s morality
fizzles out to the point of exhaustion when the'
conduct it criticises happens to he that of 1
a renegade Protectionist. For Dibbs, who*
has abandoned the Freetrade monomaniacs,,
the D.T. has no mercy. He must conform
to the highest principles of right conduct
in all matters, minor or major, or be made bo 1
smart under the editorial lash. Jennings must*
not even “suppress” a meaningless, not to say
idiotic, sentence of a despatch. Gary an, Abbott,
and Fletcher are gibbeted in leading articles if
they deviate a hair’s breadth from the spirit of the'
code of honour so dear to the D.T.’s sanctified l
heart. But when a Freetrader—especially one l
who for “ reasons ” which will not stand the light)*
of day, has suddenly become such—indulges in-
eccentricities which argue excessive moral obll--
qulty, the D T, is either silent or explanatory,-
Last week the journal named favoured the public
with a flue illustration of its peculiarity. It had l
printed a paragraph, evidently inspired by the-
Mines Department, to the effect that the Twenty;
five Pound Abigail had completed the drafting?
of a bill dealing with mining on private property 4,
which measure, (he paragraph affirmed; was far'
more suitable to the requirements of New- South l
Wales than the one Mr. Garland has on two>
occasiors submitted to Parliament. Garland l
hereupon wrote to Abigail asking if the latter or
his officials h.ad inspired the par. To this Abigail
vouchsafed the subjoined reply :
"My dear Mr. Garland, — The paragraph certainly was 1 -
not inspired by me All I did was, in reply to inquiry, state
that you bad introduced a bid; but in some particulars my
bill was different, and I,asked that no comments might be'
made. You may, be sure that whenever I iutronuce the"
measure a proper .word of proise will be given to you for the
treat in'eresfc you have taken in the question. X would*
counsel care and judgment in any reply you make, or the
sreat object you have at.heart may be injured.—Yours, F.A;
31st August, 188J5.”
Garland, then wrote a long letter to the D.T.
with the object of showing that his bill could not l
well be improved upon; and to this letter the*
D.T appended a note as follows
" The paragraph objected to contains no comment of our*.
It is simply the gist of a conversation between the Minister l
for Mi es ano our,reporter. It should be obvious to both’ l
Mr. Garland and Mr. Abigail taat if the Mima Depart-
ment co sidered Mr. GARLANDS bill ‘amiable’ to the
colony, the trouble of preparing another would not be in-
curred. We have merely reported the Department's reason *
for its intended action.—ED. D.T.” -
Evidently, therefore, either Abigail or the D.T.’
is guilty of a mean and deliberate falsehood, none*
the lees culpable because it is ostensibly gratui-
tous. But the D.T. did not pursue its usual l
course of following up an exposure of vicious-con-•
duct with severe castigations in its leading?
columns. On the contrary, it began to make dis-
coveries to the effect that Abigail is a very smart'
administrator and a valuable servant of the pub-
lic;, and now we are virtually asked to put our
faith in a man who is capable cf denying the-
truth when it suits his purpose —because he is ac-
tive in the destruction of rabbits I
The Resurrection of Land-sharking',-
Vainglory and bravado, or else recklessness and-
folly, have led the Hon. Thomas Garrett to re
veal the sum of his designs regarding land legisla-
tion in New South Wales. He has declared his-
intention of subverting the whole system recently
introduced, and-of bringing back the abandoned;
and abolished systems of 1861 and 187 J. Keen
casuist as ho is-, ha could not, on declaring this-
intention, suggest a< single advantage obtainable*
by this mad reversion to* the errors of the past.
On his ipse dixit alone he asked support for his*
extraordinary proposal. Sir John Robertson
will assist in this work of annihilating the Act of
1884, and, judging by their past efforts of land'
legislation, it may fairly be admitted that a mea-
sure draftc d by these geniuses will be worse than-
could be drawn by any other six men in the colony.
That Mr. Milburncreekdarltnghareour Gar-
rett has determined to aboluh the principlesnow
embodied in law is no more than might have been*
expected. The Act of 1884 deprived land-agents'
of half their plunderous profits by introducing
the pr'nciple of decentralisation. Mr, GarketT
is, or was, a land-agent, therefore the Bill meant
personal financial deprivation to him ; a return to
the former law would mean the recovery of their
former princely incomes to land-agents and land-
sharks ; therefore these clever practitioners will
hail the Forbes declaration with immense joy. To
them it means certain thousands yearly where
they now only receive uncertain hundreds. When
the Act of 1884' was being discussed, the votes of
squatters were fruitlessly objected to on the
ground that they were personally interested in
the question ; with ten times greater force could
the objection be urged against the votes of land-
agents, yet at present there is a land-agent occu-
pied in drafting the veiy species of law which
will directly tend to the benefit of his class. The
only consolation is that there is not the smallest
fear that he will succeed in his attempts.
Sir Henry Parkes has not a sufficiently
servile following to make the repeal of
the existing Act even a remote possibility.
When, in December, 1882, the Parker Robertson
Ministry asked electors to perpetuate the system
of corruption that then prevailed, the ballot box
gai ean emphatic negative to the proposal. Of
the Parkesi'.es who “ went to the country” all but


six stayed there, M‘Elhone securing more votes
than the defeated and disgraced Paekes at East
Sydney. And the devoted opposition of that time
to Robertsonian land-laws has now graduated
from a sentiment to an instinct. The mass of the
people would not surrender the increased rentals
now obtained from pastoral areas ; the squatters
will not give up their present security of tenure ;
and no electors of any sort or description will
consent to permit the Hon. Thomas Garrett,
land-agent by profession, to bring back the era of
trickery, and disaster abolished with a unani-
mous comprehensive electoral curse by the voters
of December, 1883,

The Case of Henry Borsboom.
Instead of being commicted to the care of the
warder and the silence of the condemned cell,
Henry Borsboom has been acquitted amid the
congratulations of friends, and his acquittal has
been followed by the strangely inconsistent com-
ments cf a sensationalistic press. Mr. Borsboom
is a lucky man! The verdict of the jury has
conditionally acquitted him of the charge of
murder on the grounds of insufficient evidence,
without giving as a necessary alternative the
' cau-e of Mrs. Borsboom's death as the result of
self attempted mui der. There is very little
imagination on the part of the public in regard to
these cases. The possibility of the deed being
committed by any third party is stolidly over-
looked, but now that Mr. Borsboom has been
acquitted the police must find the guilty third
party. We do not personally yearn for this
individual’s apprehension simply because we are
not enamoured of our present civilised mode of
punishment, and we consider that the harm to the
community resulting from unpunished crime is
less than that resulting from brutalising execu-
tions. Similarly, supposing Borsboom to have
really killed his wife, which in the face of his
acquittal is not a fair assumption, we doubt
very much if public morality would be advanced
in any measure by hanging him. Whatever of
harm accrues from this Castlereagh-street tragedy
springs from the publication in sensational news-
papers of the account of the crime. Some few
hysterical women may find in the circumstances
of the case antecedent example for suicide. Mr,
Borsboom's acquittal simply obviates duplicating
a tale of horror, and what cf deterring effect is
needed has already been afforded in the detention
of the suspect, the agony of mind, the nervous
affliction and horror of suspense he has endured.
Not that the gallows deters. Far from it Chris-
tiana who fear alike God and the Devil, who
yearn for the joys of heaven, and tremble in anti-
cipation at the prospective horrors of hell, when
urged by revenge or pecuniary interest frequently
commit crimes of blood. If the fear of the
flames of Tophet fails, will the fear of
a wooden modern fetich, a simple tie-beam
and its pendant noose operate?—we think not
Mr. Borsboom is a lucky man ! He has escaped
a hideous doom, and the public has escaped a
hideously sensational press report which would go
further in the manufacture of crime than the pos-
sible escape of a criminal. The sigh of relief
breathed forth by the various Sydney newspapers
is, however, somewhat absurd considering the
consistent blood-howling in which they indulged
during the Mount Rennie and Johns trials, and
seems to point to the superior comparative re-
spectability of Henry Borsboom as a reason for
gratulation in his cate that sufficient evidence was
not forthcoming to consign him to the tender
mercies of Howard the philanthropist.

When the child-like and bland Consul U. Tsing
and General Wong Ho were in these parts they
were never tired of bluffing off all complaints
against their countrymen by the remark, “ The
Chinese are a law-abiding race. You have your
laws—why do you not enforce them ? We do in
China, and there the Chinese give no trouble.”
That’s a fact. Notwithstanding the enormous
population of China, the people “ give no trou-
ble or, at least, if they do it does not last long.
An officer of the French Legation at Pekin has ex-
plained how this is worked. Order is secured by
means of the secret police, and the rigorous ap-
plication of the law by those who are responsible
for its maintenance. The Emperor looks to the
grand mandarin for the preservation of order, the
grand mandarin looks to his subordinate for the
same, this subordinate keeps his eagle on on the
mandarin of the second-class, who looks sharply
after the officer of the third-class, and this official
expects the father of every family to answer with
his head for the conduct of his children. On the
other hand, the father has the power of life or
death over his children; and the mandarin has
the same power over all the inhabitants of
his district. The result is that the slant-
eyed Paterfamilies, fearful of losing his own
shaven pall, sacrifices his children the mo-
ment he considers them guilty; and, in
the cases of orphans, the mandarin takes
particular care to act the Roman father to
them. Such a thing as a revolution in China
would be impossible, for, before it could reach the.
Imperial Palace, all the members of the Minis-
terial hierarchy would require to be up to their
necks in it, and thereby place the said necks
'under the knife. In the way of taxation a similar
beautiful system is worked. The Sovereign says
'to his Premier, or grand mandarin : “I require so
much money from your Government.” Tne grand
mandarin at once sends for his subordinate, and
■says: “I require so much money from your pro-
vince,” hue, just to keep on the safe side, he
doubles the amount the Emperor asked for. The
subordinate calls the mandarin of the third class
up and repeats the command, with the exception
that he doubles the amount he was asked to
'collect, and so this admirable system runs from
one to the other. It is a woful pity Premier
Parkes did not return with Messrs. Tsing and
Ho If he had done so, he would discover that, al-
though we have nothingto learn from England, we
could learn a deal from Cnina —and much of it
would be exactly suited to his own peculiar taste
and policy.

-About the coolest piece of domineering tyranny
on record is the proposal of the Tasmanian
'Government to tax the individual means of liveli-
hoed, and refuse a man the liberty to earn his
'bread until he has paid five or ten pounds for the
privilege of possessing anything at all; and a
pound or so more for the leave of havirg a place
to ply his calling in, into the bargain. They
make a base attempt to curry favour with tne
physical toiler, fearing the result of his bodily
vigour as opposed to their rapacity, and therefore
promise him a complete immunity, but propose to
inflict these astounding penalties for being alive
upon the unfortunate clerks and shopmen who
are so unlucky as to have a “billet’ instead of
going from job to job— though they may earn
scarcely half as much as the labourer can when
he is not crowded down by an artificial influx, and
have to maintain an appearance besides. It is, at
all events, to be hoped that the working men will not
ha bamboozled by any such promises into allowing
these infamous impositions to pass unchallenged.
It is the most unjust scheme that was for-
mulated in any country, not even excepting
Russia. A young man is, in fact, to be prohibited
from entering a profession, and anybody from
rising above the position of a cleik or labourer,
unless he or his relatives can afford to pay for the
license to live, and the only consequence can be
that everything worth havirg will pass as a herit-
age to the sons of the moneyed classes, and the lower
ranks of livelihood will be crowded into a state of
pauperism, This direct embargo upon the exis-
tence cf local population would quite warrant the
nation it is sought to stifle in making a clean sweep
of the M*ni airy who have the impudence to propo e
such a thing—even by means a good deal less
peaceable than any we should generally advo-
cate.
Neither the Church of England nor that of Rome
took any very surpassing Interest in the fate of
the blackfellow a short lime s g), and now they
are running amuck at each other for the privilege
of teaching him. Have they suddenly discovered
that King Billy is ignorant of the way to eternal
salvation, and are they accordingly burning with
zeal to rescue his soul in time ? No, sonny, they
have just got wind of an offer of 300,000 acres of
land to anyone who will undertake to civilise the
aborigine. Tney will pump Bible into him with
one hand, and pay several parsons fat salaries out
of the proceeds of his labour with the other. Then
they will proceed to erect public houses on part of
the improved land, and let the rest of it to im-
poverished immigrants at a high rental after
wards, and evict them as soon as they dare to
vote for opening libraries or museums on Sunday,
or directly they fall into temporary straits and
ask for time to pay the rent, which will be in-
creased whenever the land is improved by the
tenants. That is how salvation is done nowa-
days.
+
The good people who complain of the shocking
consequences of not having the Bible grained into
the heads of the rising generation have scored a
spier did win. A squatter, Wadham Wyndham,
a devout student of the Bible, has been following
the good examples of A iiraham and Jkphthah,
thereby proving the potent influence of the sacred
volume upon those who become thoroughly im-
bued with it. Those people who shiink, aid per-
haps ut’er a dainty shriek of horror, as they read
of the unhappy Wyndham’s wholesale torture and
slaughter of his family, do not taka quite the same
view of faith as they affect when they praise
Abraham for his “confident obedience to the
Lord ’’ in leading Isaac to the slaughter-place.
But then Wyndham lived in the latter days, and
Goo, the clergy will tell you, perhaps, does not
work in the same mysterious fashion as he did
then. Indeed, looking at matters fairly and
squarely all round, He would appear to have be-
come obsolete. If not, we fail to see any
difference between the cases, nor is there any-
thing at all in the Scriptures to go against the
supposition that God made such a command to
Wyndham as he is recorded to have previously
done to Abraham and the rest. Isn’t this logical?
If not, why not ?
An old, old face looms out once more from the
leading columns of the Sydney D.T. In days gone
by, when that wilted journal hoisted the flag of
Protection half-mast high, the outpourings of its
leader-writing bogey scared its readers into a
belief in Freetrade, and now, when it bows before
the Freetrade fetish, it is fast scaring them back
again to Protection. The Telegraph is the
bursting gun of the Freetrade party, and it
answers as many purposes as the wax-work figure
of Mary, Queen of Scots, which passes one day as
a monarch, and the next is invested with pants
and whiskers and a few blood stains and a meat-
axe and is then bent over and ticketed as a hump-
backed murderer. At present it is the D.T. with
the broken-back and the axe which speaks ;
“ Speaking at the public banquet tendered to the Ministers,
Mr. Lakeman, one of the representatives of the district,
advocated a line from Hay to Deniliquin, with the view of
bringing the district into closer connection with the Mel-
bourne market. . . . Hay is closer to Melbourne than it
is to Sydney, and, other things equal, the nearest centre of
commercial gravity will exert the most powerful attraction.
... If this line were constructed, Mr. Lakeman argued
that squatters would be able to ‘ make fortunes where they
are now obliged to content themselves with a bare living.'
Instead of having to run their stock into Sydney and sell it
for what it would bring they would have the same option of
the two markf ts and by that means would always be in a
position to command better prices. So Mr. Lakeman, this
protectionist friend of the working man, is anxious to create
a condition of things which would compel the general New
South Wales public to nay a higher pri e for their beef and
mutton in order that the squatter, instead of earning a liv-
ing, may make a fortune. Why should not the Sydney cn-
sumer of beef and mutton be allowed to avail himself of the
natural fluctuations of the market in his favour as well as the
back-country producer ?'
And this, ye gods, is Freetrade! The people of
Hay want permission to construct a private rail-
way to enable them to export frealy to Melbourne
in the hope that they will there obtain better
prices, and thus bring more money into N S. W.,
and the Telegraph, in the sacred name of Free
trade, urges that this privilege should be refused
for the protection of the Sydney consumer of beef
and mutton, la other words, it fears that the
farmers and squatters of the south-west, if pro
vided with facilities for ihe sale of their produce
in another part of Australia, will buy goods of
Australian manufacture in return, instead of pur-
chasing from the Sydney importers as hitherto !
The Freetrade of the Telegraph consists in ham-
pering intercolonial trade lest it should interfere
with foreign importation ; the Protection of The
Bulletin consists in giving every facility
for internal commerce, and thus weiding the dis
jointed colonies Of Australia into one powerful
and prosperous nation, while restricting in all
possible ways the ruinous competition of the white
slaves of Europe and the dusky tribes of Asia.
The resolution recently passed by the Victorian
Legislature in favour of absolute intercolonial
Freetrade proves that this policy is perfectly prac-
ticable, and in taking this initiatory step towards
the establishment of an Australian national policy,
the Protectionists have already proved themselves
more liberal by far than the boastful Cobdenites
of New South Wales.

Another stipendiary magistrate—Mr. W. John-
son—has been commissioned to report on a dis-
pute in connection with what is virtually a public
institution. We refer to the Glebe Children's
Hospital. On the last occasion when a stipendiary
magistrate was similarly appointed, in conjunc-
tion with two experienced officials, to report upon
the conduct of the asylums, the result of the in
vestigallon proved so unsavoury to the ‘ ‘ good
government” that a further inquiry—a sham one
—was instituted in order to soften down the hard
facts elicited against the officials whom the report
clearly convicted of gross neglect and cruelty
towards the helpless inmates. The snub to the
Commission was as direct and gross as it was pos-
sible to he. To avoid a repetition of this, Mr.
Johnson should have carefully ascertained if the
parties concerned are remotely connected with
any member of the Ministry or their friends, also
the direction in which the sympathies of the
Ministry tend. Failing this, the report will pro-
bably be chucked to one side while Premier
Parkbs undertakes a trip to the institution in the
disguise of a nurse, accompanied by a not too dis-
interested witness.
In the Victorian Legislative Assembly, Mr. Zox
has been advocating flogging for immoral offences
against woman and children. Apropos of this,
wa have only to remark that nearly all stout
old gentlemen with crooked political vision, when
they get past fifty, usually become savagely
virtuous in their notions —especially if they
happen to have been indoctrinated with the
Mosaic code. Zox will please give us an oiiginal
idea instead of raising up the played out blood
thirsty systems of the horrid beastly old kings of
Israel, and trying to cram them down our throats
as specifics calcu'ated to cure all the ills of the
body corporate. Zo::, judging from his latest utter
ances, is a good spec men of the dull Tory-minded
bourgeois class, one of the articles of whose creed
is that the lash is good logic when applied to the
sensualist. As a matter of fact the lash is pre-
scribed by the code law of N.S. W. for a dozen or
two of offences, the mere committal of which
shows that the culprit is suffering from mental
disease,
+
An intelligent Western farmer, who has been a
loyal Freetrader all his life, now admits to the
Orange (N.S, W ) Advocate that he must turn his
theory up, as he sees no hope for himself or his
fellow-farmers except in Protection. He says :
"We can sell nothing that we grow at a f »ir price, and wo
grow a great many things we cannot sell at all. He experi-
ences great difficulty in selling his bacon at even 6d a pound
in Orange, though it was farm-fed and well cured. He tays
there is really no local market, while the Sydney market is
swamped with New Zealand, Tasmanian, and Victorian, &o ,
produce ; that successive Governments have shown that they
care nothing about the farmers or their interests, and have
never kept a single promise made them. They were promised
reduced freights on agricultural produce, they were promised
a Minister for Agrioultu e, they were promised model farms
and agricultural schools, and that was all. He said he wou'd
go for Protection at the next election, straight, for if it did
not improve things it could not possibly in ike them worse
than they were at the present time, and that, as far as he
could see, bottom had not been touched yet.”
“ William of Orange ” is likely to have anything
but a kiss-in-the-ring time of it daring the next
election unless the “good Government” goes over
to Protection before the struggle comes off.
Melbourne public opinion is fairly divided on
the local “contempt of court” trouble. Chief
Justice Higinbotham runs a business in the Law
Courts, and Thomas Fa kin runs his business in a
yard adjoining. The one wishes to hear counsel
and collect his thought 3, while the other desires
to manufacture auctioneers’ notice boards. Peace
and quietness are essential to Higinbotham, and
Dakin's fortunes are most in the ascendant when
his vassals make most row. The principals can’t
both work at the same time—so much is clear.
Therefore it happened that when Dakin refused
to leave off hammering, the Justice fined him 20
shillings for “contempt.” Of the two sufferers
moat sympathy is felt for the liberal-minded auto-
crat of accident, forced into a painful position by
the petty agency of a carpenter’s hammer. He
has nothing to gain in the struggle between legal
might and legal i ight, except a cessation of head-
aches. Whereas it is pretty certain that Mr.
Dakin’s cheap martyrdom will be terminated by
Government paying him to clear out. Amid all
our anxiety for the liberty of the subject Dakin,
it is well to remember that Chief-Justice Hiqin-
botiiam is also a subiect, a man, and a brother.
as such he ought to bo permitted to take the only
possible measures (he couldn’t shift the Law
Courts) to protect himself against an insufferable
nuisance. Our verdict is for both sides, with
damages against neither.

The Juvenile Offenders’ Bill brought up a lot of
discussion in the Victorian Assembly last week on
the subject of that barbarous and inhuman mode
of punishment—solitary confinement. Even a
case-hardened gaoler like Mr. Brett, Inspector-
General of Penal Establishments in Victoria, is
dead against the “ indiscriminate ” way in which
the judges have been ordering “ solitary.” Brett
says that the punishment affscts the minds of
many prisoners. G. D. Carter, M.L.A., de-
clared he would rather see the rack and thumb-
screw revived than the punishment of “ solitary ”
extended by placing it in the hands of magistrates.
Patterson and Dr. Quick “ put the case against
solitary conficement, and told of its horrors and
the insanity which followed it.” The late Justice
Sir Redmosd Barry, who devoted great atten-
tion to dealing with criminals, stated in public on
one occasion that he could not understand how a
man with a scrap of mind underwent a consider-
able term of solitary confinement without becom-
ing insane.
The value attached to membership of
Melbourne Stock Exchange may be ganged by the
fact that Mr. Thomas Staddert, of Ballarat, has
just paid £BOO for the seat vacated by Mr. D.
Molhado.
Francis Adams has pub together a shilling
dreadful, which Kemp and Boyce, of Melbourne,
are j nst about to publish. The edition is 10,000,
and that is surely saying something for the enter-
prise of the publishers. The title, however, is we
fear, too severely classical for Australian readers.
It is “ Madeline Brown’s Murder.”
That Black Wednesday business was the
best thing that ever happened to some, of the
Civil servants of Victoria who were its victims,
just as “lagging” was the “ making” of many a
big Australian colonist. Amongst the Black
Wednesday men who have signally prospered ever
since, three are conspicuous—namely, Mr. William
Temileton, Mr. Byron Moore, and Mr. Walter
Madden. Mr. Templeton, when he was removed
from the position of P.M- in the Melbourne
suburbs, founded the Trustees, Executors and
Agency Company, for years past a most flourish-
ing concern, and of which he is managing director.
Mr. Byron Moore s Exchange is the finest institu-
tion of its kind in these colonies, and besides this
he has the secretaryship of the V. R.C. Mr.
Madden. after being turned out of the Crown
Lands Office, returned to it as Minister, and
he has now an extensive private practice as a
surveyor and civil engineer. Many other victims
of Graham Berry’s despotism have also been far
more successful than if they had been allowed to
remain in the Government service. Some of them
were given the opportunity to return to the ser-
vice but declined to do so. It is not generally
known that the tide of “ BUck Wednesday ” was
given to the day upon which, the wholesale dis-
missals took place by Mr. James Service. And a
few short years afterwards he took Berry to his
bosom, sat with him in the same Cabinet, and
ultimately made him Agent-General for Victoria
in London.
The Case of William Roy.
The Bulletin has so far acknowledged subscrip-
tions to the amount of £63 9s. 3d. received by it
on behalf of William Roy, the soldier who now
lies blind and paralysed in Parramatta Asylum.
As already stated, Roy wears the distinguished
conduct medal, awarded him for his gallant con-
duct at Rorke’s Drift, where, though at the time
an invalid, he rushed through the flames during
the fight to save the sick from the burning hospi-
tal. He subsequently received from the hands of
the Queen, an autograph Bible, and his portrait is
to be seen in the celebrated painting by De Neu-
ville now in the New South Wales National
Gallery. The unfortunate man, who, since his
admission to the wretched asylum that is now his
home, has. according to the report of the gentle-
men appointed to enquire into the management of
the N.S.W. Government charities, been treated
with wanton neglect and cruelty, is in a hopeless
condition of health, and will, while he lingers, be
utterly dependent on the good offices of those who
may wish to make a substantial protest against
the hollow-hearted system which, while it spends
lavishly to commemorate triumphs .gained chiefly
at the cost and never for the benefit of the class
from which the common soldier is drawn, cal-
lously permits a brave private to die in misery.
The Bulletin hopes to collect a considerable
sum for Roy, and undertakes to see that he is
directly benefited by its expenditure. The follow-
ing additional donations are now thankfully
acknowledged:—

A sturdy but somewhat ungrammatical
correspondent sends us this poser :—“ Has travel-

Justice in England appears to have one

We are in receipt of the first number of
the Spectator, a new weekly published at Manly
under the joint editorship of Messrs. Harold W.
H. Stephen and our talented friend, Joseph
O’Byrne. The Spectator contains a lot of excel-
lent reading, including a set of verses by Mr.
O’Byrne, who, we may whisper, Is identical with
no leas a personage than the “E. Lowe” who
from time to time has contributed so much real
poetry to this paper.
A batch of Gippsland fishermen have been
arrested for illegal netting in Lake Tyers, the fish
of which are preserved in ‘the interests of the
blacks. Among the degenerate successors of
Andrew and Pater were two members of the
Harmy, presumably poaching for the Loard. A
wily D. purchased the full rig of a Harmy
‘ oaptirg,” and collared his men in the middle of
a bogus Hallelujah meeting. To such base uses
may the bleaicd uniform be brought.
The municipal deadlock at Roma (Q ) has
ended. The mayor, in his capacity as a trades-
man and a citizen was legally punished for Sunday
transgressions against the law of the realm, and
his virtuous brother aldermen thereupon refused
to be associated wi- h one who had brought such
dire disgrace on the high office. At this juncture
someone suggested that the ratepayers’ opinion
should be obtained. This was done, and the free
and independent declared their confidence in his
worship br a majority of sixteen votes. The
mayor is now puzzled whether to resign or net.
Ha is not quite certain about the interpretation of
that vote.
The Victorian Assembly is thinkirg of
wasting some more public money in ventilating
the House. A few hundreds are voted for ven-
tilation every year, but all experiments have been
unsuccessful up to now. The members can ven-
tilate their opinions right enough, while they
themselves sit and perspire in an atmosphere of
jobbery. The manager of the Victorian
Atmospheric Refrigerating Company claims
that his patent system would keep the car-
cases of members fresh and sweet through
an all night sitting. If he gets the ventilation
contract wa hope he won't freeze Victoria’s hopes
and pride and sell ’em by the pound.
The origin of the Hawaiian revolution has
been bottomed at last. Our dear old friend,
Osmond Day, the howler, late of Sydney Domain,
has been causing trouble in the sea-girt kingdom
of Queen Kapiolani. He started in business over
there as a lecturer and a loyalist to King Kala-
kana, and when he had borrowed 300 dollars from
the king and given him an I O U. for the amount,
the pair fell out and Osmond attacked the poor old
potentate in his bitterest Inner Domain invective,
alleging that his Majesty was be spotted with
snuff, besotted with gin, and possessed of no more
brains than a galvanised frog.” Then old KalaJ
kaua, whose wife was doing the grand among the
Jubilee royalties in London, sent a flag of truce
aud a bag of money to induce the Sydney revolu-
tionist to return to his stump in the City of the
Beautiful Harbour, but the offer, so Day says,
was rejected with contumely. Then with
a red handkerchief and an armed crowd Day
stormed the palace gates, on the outside of which
he halted and harangued his sans culottes under
the electric light. A more respectable party that
had been waiting for something to turn up j umped
his claim, took possession of the Government, and
squashed the revolution, and the ex-Domain
orator was once more sat upon, not, however,
until he had cost the worll something in cable-
grams and startl-d h-r sable Majesty out of
England,


The Decadence ot “ Religion "
A correspondent of a Sydney newspaper draw
attention to the data supplied by the New Sout
Wales Statistical Department under the head o:
“ Attendance at Church." The figures show tha
while the population of the colony in 1886 had in
creased 141,222 as compared with the populatio
in 1883, the number of persons attending churc
hud decreased in the same period by 19,800 ! Th
Protestant denomirations had suffered a less i
attendance to the number of no fewer than 21,472
the Homan Catholics reducing the gross loss by a
increase of 1672. It would appear from th
figures that the Romanists are hardly maintaioin
their ground, while the Church ot England, Pres
byterians, Weeley ans, Baptists, and
ists are all rapidly losing their hold on the people
We are disposed to regard the facts here disclose!
as a healthy sigh. The people are evidently out
growing the intellectual condition which under
lies more than half the mischief that oppresse
mankind. They are perceiving with constantly
increasing clearness that dealers in theology anc
he'.igion, in all ages and all countries, produce one
great result, whatever smaller ones their opera
tions yield. In the past they have caused endless
bloodshed, and even in these days of their decay
they contrive to keep alive a vast sentiment of
hatred between sections of the human race. They
pit nation against nation, and divide every com
tnunity into which they .manage to push them-
selves into more or lesi bitterly hostile camps.
A correspondent at Auburn, near Parramatta,
writes to the effect that that locality
was comparable to Goldsmith's “loveliest village
of the plain” until ihe parsons invaded it
“ Now,” he declares, “ ihe residents are engaged
in endless quarrels as to the relative merits of
Parson Colvin and Pan on O’Connor, and where
formerly all was amity and goodwill, nothing
save enmity and hatred, dividing even families, is
to be found. It would be better,” he irreverently
adds, “ if some enterprising publicans would buy
up the churches and convert them into drink-
shops.” Without going so far as that, we cer-
tainly think the public interests would be sub-
served if a few of the religious edifices in Sydney
were transformed into music-balls. Dicant
music never yet did man harm ; but the most
notable outcome, political and social, of the
teachings vouchsafed by a majority of
the parsons extant is assuredly bad in every point
of view. The data furnished by the statistician
prove that the people generally are not blind to
the facts stated. They are rapidly leaving the
parsons in the lurch, and going in for rational and
humanising recreations on the day of rest. If
Parkes only waits a few years, he will doubtless
be able to buy up St.'Andrew’s Cathedral, reredos
and all, and thus secure a first-rate and centrally
located National Dead-house on cheap principles.
Haynes’ Triumphs!
The misrepresentations of the Freetrade papers of
New South Wales have been amusingly illustrated
by their record of the wanderings—wanderings is
a good word, by the way—of Mud J. Haynes.
According to these journals, the tour of this roar-
ing renegade and “ denominational savage ” has
been one series of triumphs from Lithgow to
Dubbo, and from Newcastle to Glen Innes. The
local papers, however, put an entirely different
complexion on the matter. No one doubts that
the fanat'eal members of Ihe L O.L. and
that section of the community who are
aroused to enthusiasm when they see a
clown grin through a horse’s collar, have
applauded Jack, but the more sober and intelli-
gent portion of the public appear to have given
him the cold shoulder. Though Haynes had for
a long time boasted of his intention to smash the
Protectionists into atoms, he was knocked out in
the first round at Lithgow by Caulfield, the Boy
Politician. AtOrange he m et wit h similar t ea t men t,
for the Liberal tells us that the B.P. “brought
Haynes, after his servile adulation of the Premier,
face to face with a scathing and abusive para-
graph-resurrected by The Bulletin— written
by Haynes against Parkes only a couple of years
ago, and those amongst the audience who were
capable of reflection had a somewhat restless
night after hearing what the lecturer once
thought of their political demigod.” At Bathurst
the Record tells us that “ Haynes’ audience
consisted of 25 men and four boys,” yet this was
telegraphed as a tremendous triumph for Free-
trade ! This paper has a very poor opinion of
Haynes, whom it describes thusly: “As a
speaker, Haynes is a dead failure. His voice is
as wretched as his brains. His gestures are low
and vulgar.” At Dubbo about 150 persons
assembled In the street to bear Haynes, and he
got an exceedingly warm reception from them,
though in the telegram the disapprobation was
said to have been shown at David Buchanan.
On the latter pointing out the mendacious charac
ter of the telegrams to the editor of a Sydne
daily, he was naively told : “ Oh, it must be true
Mr Haynes .sent it himself." This lets the ca
out of the bag, and plainly shows that Haynes
so-called triumph exists but in the very lively
imagination of the sender of the telegrams.
Governor Carington, Bishop Barry, and othe
new-chum authorities are perpetually talking to
or at the Australian people touching the surpris
ing loyalty prevalent in the colonies. According
to these gentry the Australians are filled with un
bounded love and admiration for, not alone the
throne and person of our Gracious Sovereign
Lady, but also for England and everything Eng
lisb. There is some truth in the latter doctrine
The people here do esteem and respect the English
who fought for and realised liberty of though ;
and speech—for the English who would tolerate
no form of Government that was not essentially
self-government. But what Australian can enter
tain a feeling other tnan disgust and contempt
for the England of to-day, which refuses
autonomy to the Irish, and puts down public
meetings of that people by force of arms! If the
proceedings at Ennis last Sunday express, in any
considerable measure, the current opinion of
England, then we say with confidence that Aus-
tr liana, to a man, will instinctively repudiate
that country’s right to he regarded otherwise than
with loathing. But we do not for a moment sup-
pose that the high-handed measures taken by
Salisbury and his gang of fossils have the ap-
proval of any Englishman outside of the narrow
minority that has for years struggled hard to
foster a reactionary sentiment among the people.
The people of England cannot sympathise with
government by bayonet and truncheon ; and it
is certain as anything in the future can be
that whenever the ballot-boxes are passed
round again the people of England will drive the
Tories cwm-Unionists from power, and into the
outer darkness from whence they came. And the
sooner the British people have a say in the matter
the better for the well-being of the nation.
That great principle of freetrade which tends to
fix wages all the world over, according to the
scale paid in the cheapest country on earth is
getting into full swing in these colonies. At a
meeting of South Australian stockholders, a few
days ago, it was resolved that, as shearing costs
only 6s. per hundred in Mexico, a fraction less in
South America where it is performed by women
and—thanks to the cheapness of the half-nakec
Caffre— ss. per hundred at the Cape of Gooc
Hope, it is now time to make a great reduction in
the rates paid in Australia, and if the white
shearers should object to this measure, it is pro-
posed to form an association and import Caffres to
do the work. Of caur-e the Australian shearer will
object. The dull, ignorant, suj erstitious, unclean
Mexican mongrel may work, if he pleases,
for just enough to buy gaudy clothes and dit t in a
land of extraordinary cheapness, but that is no
reason why the Cornstalk should : and the Caffre.
lower and cheaper s'ill, also dirtier, oilier, and
more ignorant even than the Mexican, may also
follow his own bent. Hat according to Freetrade
doctrines, the fact that these far-away strangers
are willing to labour for a pittance is sufficient
reason why the Australian should do likewise.
According to the doctrines of grasping, bru alised
selfl'hness, because the Caffre is low the Aus-
tralian must go down to his level, and
if some lower, cheaper, meaner savage should
afterwards be disovered, the Caffre and the Aus-
tralian will alike be expected to descend to his
sraudard. The proposal to import African
shearers is only another step in this process of
levelling downwards, and unless every white
working man in Australia will boycott alike the
employers of black labour, the ships that carry on
this new slave trade, and the shipowners who
lend their vessels to such a traffic, a time will
come when human scum from the end of the earth
will be imported into Australia, and their direct
competition will force wages down to the vanishing
point of cheapness. To a certain class of capi-
talists the fact that some naked barbarian can
live for a given sum is sufficient reason why
a white [man should do the same, and on
such men as these, legal force is the
only argument which is not thrown away.
The white workmen of Australia, seeing that a
great fight with coloured labour looms ahead, are
anxious to have the row over, and are perfectly
willing that the first gun of the struggle shall be
fired by those British capitalists and their agents
—we will not say squatters—who wou’d import to
this country cheap nigger shearers, even as
Parke s imported cheap nigger compositors in the
long ago. One year the Caffre chews up a line-
regiment or two of beardless British boys led to
the slaughter by a set of “ aristocratic ” noodles
satirically termed military commanders ; a year or
two afterwards the same Caffre is turned loose in
Australia to reduce to obedience the recalcitrant
bushman who wants to be paid for his labour.
This, dear friends, is a glimpse of the working of
Imperial Federation. We sincerely hope the
Caffre shearers will come along. When they do,
they will be bundled into the Pacific together
with our brother subject the lerer from Hong-
kong and our brother subject the rabbit-legged
coolie from the ‘ b ightest jewel in the British
crown.” And then we shall have done with the
subject for ever.

Haynes, as a political economist, is rather a
failure. In his Freetrade paper, Haynes’
Weekly, he once said :
"It should be noted that the employment of women, boys,
ard girls is one of the results of the American Protectionist
system Every human agency is pressed into the work of
production.
Yet Freetraders are always inveighing against
Protection because it ever results in over produc-
tion and consequent want of employment. Ac-
cording to the man from Mudgee, em-
ployment in Protectionist countries is of so flour-
ishing a character that there are not enough
workmen to meet its demand. Women and
children are compelled to fail to, and “every
human agency is pressed into the work of produc-
tion.” It isn’t like that in N S.W. with her 6000
unemployed.

On Saturday last the Yankees-, Obstallb

and Boland respectively, at a spot about a mile
from Albury, N.S.W. “Raw ’uas” were the
Older of the day, and Slavin, going straight for
Ccstello from the start, knocked the Yankee out
in nine rounds. Mitchell and Boland’s fight
proved a desperate affair, and it was not until 10
rounds had been disputed that a draw was de-
clared. Mitchell, as per usual, was cut to pieces
and it was only the little ’un’s indomitable pluck
that carried him through. Something further
will now be probably heard of a return match
between Slavin and Mick Dooley.

Exhibition Building.— Roller Skating Rink „
We stationed ourself on a back seat at
Sydney Royal Standard, on Saturday night, and
cast out four anchors and prayed for day. “ The
Wreck of the Dunbar a shabby, weary, weep-
ing little screed, sadder than a midnight goat, and
filled with bile and ignominy—was the alleged
amusement of an evening which ought to be
wiped out of the annals of this great nation, and
for two solid hours we cruised round the stoke-
hole of this so-called drama, till the petrifying in-
fluence of the author hooussed us into slumber.
Possibly there may be an idea of some kind hidden
away in the Sahara of the prologue or the gritty
waste of the four succeeding acts, but if so may
a curse light on the head of the man who first in-
vented ideas, and may he come down with a dull
thud that will echo over the whole earth for forty
days. The opening scene cf the “ Wreck” is laid
at South Head, but the Dunbar herself is not
visible. A number of men, however, look over
the cliff and state that a pronounced imbecile is
washing about in the sea beneath, and after ,a lot
of gallant exertion a hook is stuck in his ignorance
and he is hauled up. He is no particular good
after he is hauled up, and apparently he has only
been saved so that his sweetheart may tell him,
with her hair hanging down, that she can never be
his, as she has plighted her troth to the sailor who
signed a bill for his stepmother as a matter of
form, just after the slavey broke the window. A
shirking individual who has saved £7 is thrown
into the drama about here, and in spite of his best
efforts to get out he remains in till the end. In the
second act we began to hope that the individual
who was hauled up the cliff had finally disap-
peared, but he suddenly turns up again and once
more knocks his elbow into the gastric region of
the narrative. He takes up a collection, ana he and
his friends rush about aimlessly, buying furniture,
kissing the old woman who gave the £lOO bill,
hurrahing on the slightest provocation, tipping a
sleepy old man on top of a baby, dancing, and
hiding in dus’y earners, from which they emerge
to invest in more furniture and hurrah again.
They, pay £l2O cash for six chairs and one lop-
sided picture and go round in a state of fatuous
joy at their bargain. The moral sentiments that
the hero doesn’t utter in this and the next act it
would be a sinful waste of lime to hunt up, but
when he comes back from a whaling voyage and
finds his wife in the act of marrying the man who
was saved by means of the hook stuck in his
ignorance his language changes to curses with
nine joints, and frenzied observation that he has
to sit down to utter properly. His wife, however,
follows him to the jetty and explains the matter,
and he ends by blessing her and her new husband
and then takes a dom of something warranted to
remove human beings out of the gangway. His
end is peaceful but ridiculous, and the curtain
falls just as he is wiping his feet on the grass of
the New Jerusalem. There is very little fault
to be found with the acting, but being desirous of
letting the company down ea-y we will pursue the
subject no further.

“ Romeo and Juliet ” opened on Saturday
at Sydney Criterion with a lot of eclat and a
small amount of the other fellow. Mr. W. J.
Holloway executed Romeo, and barring the fact
that he was stouter and hoarser than of old, and
had a bush of yellowish hair, and shouted loudly,
and that the tarpaulin in which he disguised him-
self in the first act gave him a piratical and hod-
carrying aspect, he was all our fancy painted him.
We took a rough sketch of him, but in our haste
we forgot to delineate the central part of his
frame and joined his logs on to his head, so we
have reluctantly suppressed the object. Mr.
Robert Inman, whom Nature apparently intended
for the Romeo of this company, was cast for
Friar Laurence, and perpetrated that shepherd
with hia wonted ability ; and Mr. Hodson
played Capulet. Mr. Dobson appeared as
Escalus, and Mr. R. Stewart dropped on to
Mercutio with considerable success. Mt«a
Eisie Jenyns’ Juliet was even better and prettier
than in the past, and, on the whole, we are in-
clined to prefer the actress to the character. If
Juliet's parents had only turned a hydrant on her
at the age of 17 and washed a quantity of the
poetry out of her, she might, providing she were
blessed with the conspicuous toughness of Romeo,
have been living to this day, but their neglect of
this simple precaution led to a harrowing scene
which people have not yet fully got over.

It is extremely probable that Larry Foley
will bring about a new order of things when, in
conjunction with Mr. Dampier, he fairly enters
theatrical management. We can imagine Larry
erecting a rehearsal of “Hamlet." “ See here,
oampier, when the blooming Ghost comes on,
don’t be frightened of him and throw off your
overcoat unless you mean fight. If a ghost was
to show himself before me I d prop him straight
off, ask George Hill if I wouldn’t. And don’t you
stand any of Laertes’s slack in the graveyard
scene. , 'Ave it out at once ; don’t wait for any
foil rot in the last act. The boys'll all roll up to
see a good set-to with the gloves. You can cut
out all the ‘mag’ the Piiest bloke has to ‘ crack’
so as I can come on for the part, and then act as
referee, dye see?” Mr. Dampier will probably
consult Dawvid Buchanan in re Larry's proposed
innovations. They smack of novelty, at all events.

Speaking of the recent Dampier produc-

barring “Jack Sheppard” and “Tambour

plays are written ?

band who runs the Tasmanian Day Star as he
speaks of Amy Stierwin ;
“Her career has been highly creditable to herself all
through. But is she doing right ? Should not that charming
gift of song be consecrated to Him from Whom it came ?
Alas ! this applause that rings in her ears to-day, what com-
fort will it bring when the dying hour has come ? There will
be sweeter voices Yonder than Amy Sherwin’s now. What
if she finds herself out of tune, and unable to join in the
melody of Heaven
If there are sweeter voices than Amy’s “ Yonder,”
we 11 b 3 glad to go “ Yonder ” and hear them; and
our pleasure will be increased by knowing that
there will be no danger of our being disgusted by
the presence of the canting muckworm of the
Star, as he will be toasting on his own little spit
in front of the everlasting bonfire. Also “if she
finds herself out of tune and unable to join
in the melodies of heaven ” Amy will take a
reserved seat and smile at the vocal murder being

That sterling actor in high comedy, Mr.
H. N. Douglas, is the latest Dizzle of “ London
Assurance ” that Melbourne playgoers have
seen Those who have witnessed many Dazzles
in their time in the Victorian capital, and arc
fond of making comparisons, will not forgot the
sparkling personation of that character given just
twice within the last twenty years by Mr. George
Arthur Walstab, the clever Melbourne journalist.
In May, 1886, members of the Melbourne press
gave an amateur dramatic performance in the Old
Princess Theatre of that city in aid of the 6. V.
Brooke Memorial Fund. The piece selected for
performance was “London Assurance," and
Walstab took the part of Dazzle. Q. A. had just
returned from India where he had baen soldiering
in Richardson’s Horse, and editing the Calcutta
Englishman, atd the part fitted the tall,
handsome, dashirg George like a glove.
Amongst those wlio took part in the per-
formance were tno late Henry Collier, then
of the Age, the late Gilbert C. W. Roberts of the
same pauer, D. D. Wneeler, then of the Argus
now of Victorian Hansard, and others who have
since been scattered; Miss Rose Edouia (now
Mrs. G. B. W. Lewis) was the Lady Gay Spanker.
An address on the genius of Brooke was read
during the evening by Mr. Charles Bright, who
was then a member of the reporting staff of the
Argus, and an epilogua, writieu by Mr. James
Smith of the Argus (or Dr. Neild), was deliciously
delivered by Miss Edouin. The late John
Edwards, junr., the solicitor, and M. B. Stark
(then of the Melbourne Herald, now clerk in the
Melbourne City Police Court), with others,
played in an after-piece. The result of that and
other performances was the fine marble bust of
G. V. Brooke, by Summers, which is now in the
Victorian National Gallery. Tae bust was pre-
sented to the late Sir Redmond Barry and the
other trustees by the laie Mr. G. P. Smith, then
Attorney-General (an old pressman), on behalf of,
and in the presence of members of the Melbourne
Press, six or seven years ago Walstab re-ap-
peared as Dazzle at the Bijou Theatre, on the
occasion of some benefit.

Theatrical business must be looking up in
Sandhurst (Vic.). The doorkeeper of the Princess
Royal Theatre in that town had his nose broken
the other night in trying to keep the crowd out.
It is, however, only fair to state that they wanted
to come in without paying Still, even this was a
sign that the show was popular. We knew a
manager once who had to pay deadheads to go
into hia show, and we remember seeing one of
them come tottering out at the end of the first
act and offering the manager hia coin back if he
would let him off the contract. “ I’m a poor man,
but my life’s worth more to me than the money,’
he whispered hoarsely, and disappeared.

The acting of Mr. Elton in “Dorothy,”
at the Melbourne Princess’s, suggests that he
would achieve an even greater success as an ava-
lanche, or a hodful of bricks dropped irom the
top of a six-story house on the head of a parsing
policeman. He does a number of things very
well, and is mildly applauded, but it is not till he
falls down a flight of stairs, bumping heavily on
every step, and arrives at the bottom an amor-
phous wreck, that the house lashes itself into
what might be called a boiling foam of enthusiasm.
Then they yell for him to do it over again / We
should consider that applause of this kind
would bo apt to cloy in time. Ha should hire a
book-agent or a life-insurance canvasser to do this
part of his “ business ” in his place. They are
used to descending stairs abruptly.

We hear that George Augustus Sala has
been lending the light of his countenance to Nellie
Stewart in London. Augustus—like the gallant

cause or just impediment why we shouldn’t second
that resolution we’d like to take it out of him with

It is a strange fact, but nevertheless true,
that many actors who have impersonated cele-
brated historical personages, after a time become
imbued with the idea that they are indeed the
very persons themselves. Gomersal, who repre-
sented Napoleon In a spectacle at Astley’a ; Ellis-
ton, who figured as George IV. in a pageantry
production; an American actor named Blake,
who bore a striking resemblance to George
Washington, and in American theatres personated
that hero in various tableaux—all these were
striking proofs of this peculiar belief. Latterly
we have an actor among us who has played, one of
the Plantagenets so often that he almost regards
his fellow-actors as his lieges and subjects.

Recipe for concocting a modern melo-
drama. First choose your subject, it need not be

ingredients. Boil for two hours and a half, then
simmer. The whole to be served not.

Unless Melbourne has had enough of
Italian opera, Mr. Simonsen will reap profit and
honour from nR flatter at the Royal. In most res-
pects there is a marked improvement on the
Alexandra performances of six months ago.
Operas are put on more liberally, and played with
a finish previously lacking, while the orchestra
is as good as ever, and prices snow no signs of
wear and tear. If the musical public don t roll
up as before it will be because their enthusiasm
has leaked into some fresh chan.,el. But these
are only bilious speculations. ‘’ Rigoletto” fetched
a big house last Saturday, and the dose should be
repeated tuis Saturday with. “La Sonnambula.”

Offing to circumstances over which we
have no control, Melbourne Bijou has been closed
since Friday. Miss Emilio Melville’s comedy
season petered out in a blaze of sadness after an
interesting career of twelve nights. Miss Mel-
ville gives managerial “complications” as the
reason for this unpremeditated bust-up. Our own
opinion is that Nemesis waited on that gushing
creature of impulse, Mr. Hanson, for boycotlitg
The Bulletin. His show was beslavered by the
Melbourne papers, without exception, until Tub
Bulletin described it as a melancholy con-
glomeration of misdirected effort, and then it was
‘ ‘ slated ” all round. If they had solemnly
warned the old gentleman, in the first
instance, he might have been spared much
anxiety of mind. But enough cf these
sad memories. Brough and Boucloault have
taken a lease of the Bijou, and on Saturday they
put up “Held by the Enemy,” a successful play
of Amurrikan interest. New talent appears in
this. “Dorothy” is bowling along at the Prin-
cess's, in accordance with the eternal fleneas of
things. But that an attenuated atom of imbe-
cility like “ Dick ” should have lingered on for
five whole weeks, at the Opera House, is a
crusher for the Darwinian theory. Variety busi-
ness keeps brisk at Victoria Hall, although Frank
Clarke has a jealous oye on the Cjghill s over at
Sc. George’s. Those artful blacfcniggers are mak-
ing money faster than a patent medicine, and
their show is a pleasant refuge in this time of
trouble.

cuss is named Ali, and they’ve set him up at
Melbourne Wax Works, half way between the
Royal family and the Chamber or Horrors. Here
he fills a iong-Jelt want at present. Ali draws the
breath of life from 26,000 feet of wire and an
electric battery ; when the battery is turned off
at the meter he becomes just as dead as Barab-
has. Mow, Barabbas was a robber, but there is
nothing to be said against this gentlemen except
that he can’t swear. The divine gift of speech is
the one thing which the Monster wants, other-
wise he is better business than a C.M.G, He can
blow his nose, say his prayers, kiss his hand to the
girls and write things on a slate at the bidding of
a sprightly masher who conducts the patter por-
tion of the entertainment. When Ali is finally
stripped and lighted up it becomes apparent, from
his birdcage interior, that Frankenstein hasn’t
rigged him out with an immortal soul. Would

J. B. Steel, the well-known actor—hus-
band of the accomplished and favourite actress,
Miss Adelaide Bowring—is at present in Sydney.
Mr. and Mrs. Steele wera brought out from Eng-
land by Mr. George Coppin, of Melbourne, to sup-
port G. V. Brooke during that contemplated visit
to the colonies in 1866, which was prevented by
the dire calamity cf the loss of the London with
Brooke and nearly all hands on board, including
Captain Martin. Mr. and Mrs. Steele sailed for
Melbourne on the 7ch December, 1885, from
Liverpool in the ship Western Orem. This
was a very large and heavily laden soiling
vessel, and the voyage, though delightful
as far as the weather was concerned, was ex-
tremely long—extending over 112 days. The
Steeles expected to find the London and Brooke
in Melbourne before them, great things in the way
of swiftness being anticipated of that vessel,
which was a new steamship. At all events, it
would have been easy to beat the Western Ooean
with a very commonplace steamship, or even a
fast sailing vessel. But when the pilot boarded
the Western Ooean outside Port Phillip Heads the
first news he communicated to those on board was
the loss of the London and of poor Brooke. Mr,
Steele is a sterling and versatile actor—in fact,
quite “the man for Galway”—where, by-the-bye.
he first appeared on this worldly stage. A good
deal of hia time in these colonies has boon spent
in New Zealand.

Another globe-trotting Daniel has come to
judgment and kindly undertaken to translate the
writing on the wall. Mr. M‘Coan, a British
politician (out of work since the last general
election) took the Melbourne Herald interviewer
into his confidence on the subject of “ policy.” It
is clear as mud to M‘Coan that “ the question of

argument, by more than 40 years' of home experi-
ence. Protection means merely class monopoly,
the subsidising of the few at the cost of the many.
When the working men of Victoria come to
understand this, they will make short work of the
fiscal quacks who now mislead and tax them in
the interest of the manufacturer.” Just so. In
the meantime this monument of blue mouldy
wisdom may feel thankful that the workingmen
of Victoria don’t make short work of him. We
are in doubt concerning the correct pronunciation
of Mr. M’Coan’s world-renowned name, but, any-

If there is one thing in particular that we
admire with holy joy it is the cheek of the lovin’
Christian. The following, from a paper in the
Western district of Victoria, shows that this par-
ticular brand of saint is still in a pretty healthy
state “ Wanted, by a pious young man, board
and lodging in a family where Christian example
will be considered an equivalent. Apply,” &c
We boarded with a pious young man once. He
was always eating. He would get up in the early
dawn, and forage out some food to keep him up
till breakfast time, and between breakfast and
lunch he invariably experienced a sinking which
could only be appeased by a snack. Also, he
would cruise round the kitchen about four o’clock
and taste things to support him till dinner, and at
8.30 p.m. he would go out and finish the day with
a meat pie. And, on top of all this, he kept eat-
ables in a hat-box under his bed. We know by
experience what the pious young man is like, and
we can confidently assert that an elephant couldn
set an example large enough to set-off against his
board.
A sanguinary skirmish between a bailiff
and a man named Stubbs, residing at Wellington
(N.Z.), has ended in bloodshed. Stubbs was be-
hind with his rent, and the bloated monopolist
who owned tbe premises thereupon hied him unto
a bow-legged sheriff s officer, and told him to col-
lect the arrears out of the furniture. But Stubbs
was on the alert, and thougn his enemy rolled up
time after time, now as a flower-hawker and then
as a baker’s boy, and a little later as a man who
was collecting for the Jubilee, and though he also
came t inspect the meter and to take the census,
it was nearly a week before he found admittance.
At last he managed to get in by yelling “ Fire 1”
but at the same moment Stubbs came out also
yelling “Fire I” and they concussed in the door-
way with a force that sent the bailiff into the
street, and he was promptly locked out. He
picked himself up with a broken head, but next
morning ho came back in another disguise to lay
siege to the house and sat down on the doorstep.
But Stubbs had thoughtfully covered the
step with broken glass, and with a shriek the
bailiff skirmished round into the back yard, and
proceeded to pick enough splinters to make a
good-sized bottle out of his anatomy, in the shed.
Then Stubbs hailed a policeman from the window
and told him that an escaped lunatic had un-
dressed himself in the coal-house, and it cost the
! bailiff half-a-sovereign to square the vigilant
officer. When he got round again to the front
of the hotse the door was open and he entered
the hall in triumph. But all the doors opening
from it were locked except one, and when the
officer burst in here he found himself in a bath-
room, and Stubbs’ Irish slavey was just getting
under the shower. She wasn’t a party to the con-
spiracy, but Stubbs had taken the chance on the
sime principle which animated the Romans, when
they used to turn a tiger and an early Christian
into the same enclosure and await results. There
was one weird and awful shriek and then the
bailiff fled for his life into the next street, and the
curtain dropped. The bailiff resigned after this,
and the landlord took proceedings against hia
tenant, and would have got a verdict, only Stubbs
proved that the house had been taken in his wife’s
name, and it was necessary to serve a writ on her
inste id. Then there was anew trial, but evidence
was brought to prove that the new writ had been
served on Stubbs’ wife's sister by mistake, and
then there was a third writ and a third trial,
which might’ have been conclusive but for a
medical certificate that the defendant had fallen
downstairs and broken her leg. Ultimately
Stubbs relented and gave a cheque which was
dishonoured, and then he disputed the signature
and sued the landlord for giving him an un-
stamped receipt, and while the case was being
heard another bailiff got in at the instance of
another creditor and seized the furniture. At
latest advices, however, it transpired that the
sticks were only hired, and the furniture-dealer
who supplied them now talks of taking the matter
first to the Supreme Court and then to the Privy
Council and busting Stubbs’ for good and all with
the costs.

It was their wicked plan —
As though they held a lion there,
And not a ’fenceless woodyard man.
They placed him high within that dock,
The se geant sat below ;
He folded his arms behind his back,
And wiped his noble brow.
But as he stood there pale and wan,
He looked so stern and high—
So festive was his manly “front,”
So calm his cob webbed eye,
The legal rout forbore to “ shout,”
And each reporter held his strong breath,
As though they knew the hero there
Was face to face with—Judge Higlnbotham,
There was soap-lustre on his forehead,
In his optics light was found ;
And he never looked mote proud'y
Than when going to be fined a pound.

about our civilised conditions is naturally extended
to out poets. Rule, Britannia !
“P. Hanna,” of the Victorian Upper
House, who can't endure a discordant note, says
that Dakin's hammering outside the Criminal
Court was “ a premeditated affair.” Hanna him-
self is a Justice and thinks it only right to stick
up for the dignity of the coort, you know.
President Cleveland discourteously refused
to receive the fine paintirg sent from Sydney for
Mrs. Cleveland. The painting arrived at a bad

life when the romance has fled to parts unknown,
and wife and rhenmatiz have soured his temper.
Eleven prisoners for Maitland gaol, who
were to proceed by the same train as Premier
Parkes from Newcastle, were kept back for a
later train. This extra care was taken to pre-
vent accidents. Also for fear the enthusiastic
Freetraders along the route might make mistakes.
A blue-blooded beggar, Henry Finch Hat-

We take a tender 'interest in the Fmch-Hattons

The latest story told of the late Sir Red-
mond Barry is that he resolutely prohibited the
purchase of Thackeray’s works for the Melbourne
Public Library. The alleged reason is that in
“Barry Lyndon ” the great English satirist held
one of Sir Redmond’s ancestors up to deserved ap-
probrium.
Dr. Cameron Lees delivered a lecture on
“Clerical Humorists,” at Brighton (Vic.), re-
cently, and cited Sterne and Swifc as notable
examples. With true Scottish caution, however,
the Doctor refrained from quoting extensively
from the works of either of those distinguished
ornaments of the Church.
Some people think it’s very hard that
Dakin can’t hammer as he likes in the hearing of
Chief Justice Higinbotham, but it's a fact that
you can’t sneeze in the presence of Mr. Justice
Williams, of Victoria He has been known to
interrupt his charge to a jury in order to tell a
man in the gallery to “ sneeze outside.”
Dr. Stanton, Bishop of North Queensland,
who is more like a real Christian than most mag-

He walks about tne dusty street— doesn’t even sport

“ would do almost anything for him."
Two articles by Francis Adams, one on
the poetry of Arthur Clough, the other on “ Aus*
tralia as a Health Resort,” have been accepted by
Knowles for the Nineteenth Century, and will

author of the “Australian Essays ” having found
this opening.
Archbishop Carr means to reside at St.
Kilda- the most aristocratic, next to Toorak, of
the Melbourne suburbs. He is, no doubt, going
out there to mortify himself. We can recommend
the mussels on the piles of the pier. A little irre-
levancy will do this paragraph good. Christ did

The rents were too high.
During the trial of murderer Pranzini, the

It is rumoured in Melbourne that H. H.
Hayter—we really don’t like to call him C.M.G.—
Government Statist, will retire from active service
at the end of the present year. Mr, Hayter is 65
years of age, and has £BOO a year. He
has been one of the very best and keenest of Aus-
tralian official, and we trust that when sitting
beneath his own flgtree in his honorable old age
he will refrain as far as possible from the vicious
habit of writing poetry.

The victorious Walker stands 6ft. lin. and rides

Sam Weller, again! The late genial
Richard Driver, M.L A., attorney, solicitor and
proctor, and good fellow, was engaged in a case
at Sydney Water Police Court. Amor gat th
witnesses was a little girl of ten summers, who
“Mr. Inglis made a brief speech, and in-
troduced the Rev. Mr. Carrthers, who
read an address from the United Temper-
ance Societies. Sir Henry Parkes briefly
replied. As soon as the Good Templars
could persuade their fellows to abstain
from drinking casks of whisky ard barrels
of ‘tanglefoot’ and turn them into the sea,
he would be at hand to throw over the last bottle.”
The question is: Would that last bottle be an empty one?-which would make all
the difference.

Mr. Phil. Gullett was presented with a
purse of sovereigns last week on the occasion of
his resigning the editorship of the Suburban
Times (Redfern, Sydney) to assume the conduct
of the Lancefibld Gazette (Victoria), which he
has recently purchased. Mr. Gullett almost re-
gards Lancefleld as his native place. He was
born in Fitzroy (Melbourne), but taken to Lance-
fleld when he was two years old. Mr. G. is
brother of Mr. Henry Gullett, of the Sydney D.T.
He is a barrister by profession, and an LL.B. of
Melbourne University. While he leaves Redfern
in tears, Philip’s hosts of friends will receive him

All good Yorkshiremen will be glad to
hear that “ Sam ” Lister declined the offer of a
Jubilee baronetcy without troubling to give his
reasons for so doing. Mr. Lister, by his inventive
genius and keen business ability, has accomplished
wonders for the English manufacturing trade in
woollen and silk goods. The plushes that cover
the frames of fair women and drawing-room
chairs were first introduced by Sam. From his
acres of mills at Bradford—where weavers are
paid a respectable wage, as times go —is turned
out stuff cheaper than that produced by Germans
who live on two sour apples per diem. A wonder-
ful man is Sam. Years ago the Bradford citizens
erected a statue of him at the entrance to Lister
Park. And he wouldn't disgrace that marble
figure by making it a baronet.

Sydney D. T . is getting ready to turn dog

If the Evening Noose wants an additional
reason why Parkes is like a full moon, we suggest
that it may he because he is not exactly square.
Copeland, M.L.A., says that we are to

he is not the cheese.
There were 31,493 convictions for drunken-

The Northern Star (Lismore) says Cut
the Sydney Press is mainly m'-d and wiitten by

One of the tithe-raiders in Wales is a

The consumption of liquor last year in
N S.W. was £4 19s. 6d. per head of the popula-
tion. In England the consumption was £3 7s Bd,
per head As liquor is much dearer in N.S.W,
than in England the consumption in N.S.W. is
thus much larger than in the old country,
Separation is making strong progress at
Croydon. The miners see that if Separation
comes on they will form the bulk of the electors
in the North. Fe lid berg, of the Courier, once

He's down South now, and that’s all the differ-
euce.
Lord DenVgh, the most anti-Home Rule
Catholic peer in the Lords now that the brilliancy
of the Duke of Norfolk is temporarily eclipsed by
family affliction, lately announced that “the Pope
never interfered in party politics.” No ? Not after
Leo’s transactions with Bismarck, and Persico’s
mission?
Sir Charles Gavan Duffy is biding his time
for the opening of the Irish Parliament, when he
expects to become Speaker. Sir Charles is doomed
to disappointment. The Irish despise and do not
care a straw for fcim That K.C.M.G. after his
name is enough to secure his defeat in any Irish
electorate.
On the Press of North-Western N.S.W,
there have been but two writers who hwo con-
sistently advocated Protection and the downfall
of Parkes, and sympathised with the Republican
movement. We refer to Mr, J. L. Parsons, of
Bourke, and Mr. Howard, of the Nvxgan
Mercury.
Russia can now bring into the field in case
of need 2,425,577 soldiers. In addition she has
2,160,000 militia liable to serve, and if the term of
service were reduced from five to three years, the
State would in a short time be able to have
4,000,000 regular troops without having recourse
to the militia reserves.
The late Billy Miles, Queensland Minister
for Works, was a generous and honest man and a
thorough Liberal who never sat on a rail. For a
politician of the old school, his views were demo-
cratic and in striking contrast to those of the time-
serving old fogies who have climbed into place and
power in N.S.W. during the same period.
In a paragraph in the always logical and
truthful Evening News we read that at Mud J.
Haynes’s meeting at Tamworth one-third of the
meeting was very hostile, notwithstanding which
a Freetrade resolution was carried with only four
dissentients. From this we conclude that only
four people were present. John himself, no
doubt, constituted the remaining two-thirds.
Isn’t this a beautiful thing for a “ wholo-
hog-o-none ” Freetrade journal to say, and yet
that howling fiscal lunatic, the Sydney D.T. says
it:—
“Whatever we do, let us not give the wheat-importers an
advantage over the local grower by any lack of legitimate
enterprise in the management of our railways. That would
be tantamount to subsiding a monopoly, and a monopoly
in its worst form. . . . Better to give our farmers the
aroteotion of a tariff than our importers the deliberate pro-
tection of an 1 obsolete' railway system. For either the con-
sumer would in the long run have to pay.”
Sydney D.T. in reviewing the issues to te
placed before the Queenslanders at the comug
general election omits all mention of the question
of protection and freetrade which is one of the
most prominent just now in the northern colony.
Advocacy of protection was supposed to be the
trump held by MTlwraith, but now that Griffith
has declared himself a protectionist, there is little
fear that Queensland's tariff will not be ad-
justed in accordance with what Parkes terms tie
“ old worn-out principles ’’ of protection. Then
the “ mother” colony will have no option but to
swallow the lesson which her younger daughter as
well as her elder were fated to teach her.
A correspondent writes to the Melbourne
Herald to know whether the sphinx was mascu-
line or feminine. The Herald, of course, copied
some stuff out of a blue-mouldy dictionary in
reply. The great European sphinx is called B!s-

torian sphinx is called Duncan Gillies—gender un-
certain, but generally believed to be neuter.

Mr. W. Fittler, artist, best known for his
works in black and white, but also quite at home
when dealing with colours, departed for America
the ocher day by the Alameda. Before leaving he
was entertained at dinner at Paris House by a
number of friends, the company consisting chiefly
of artists, literary men. and others of that ilk. Mr.

The murdered wife of the religio-maniac,

A very successful entertainment was held
in the New Masonic Hall, Sydney, on September 2.
The object was to raise funds with which to con-
struct a gymnasium for the benefit of the N.S.W.

things to match, a very considerable raise was
accomplished.

A plain and fancy dance in honour of the
local doctor was held at Murrurundi (N.SW.)
School of Arts, the other evening. Our corres-
pondent has omitted to explain why he wanted a
ball or what good it did him, but we presume he
had been recommended to take it in water before
going to bed. Among 150 radiantin make up, were
a Zingara, a Finnish lady, Patience, Carmen,

beautiful for anything.

An exceedingly “swagger’’dramatic enter-
tainment in aid of the Mount Macedon Anglican
Church will be held in the Freemasons’ Hall, Mel-
bourne, on the 20th Inst. As the vice regal
household take their little revelation in the Mount
Macedon place of worship in the summer months
that tabernacle has become rather “ toney,” and no-
body is to perform at this spree except “ ladies
and gentlemen whose names appear in the Govern-
ment House visiting list.” Even the scene-

A “ Social Bee” was held at Raudwick

There were present H’ghland girls, Spanish girls,

It appears that the present style of English
bishopric was only established a century back.
There were bishops before those days (warm
members, too!), but of a less blessed species than
flourishes under Our Sovereign Lady. Time was
when bishops led troops to battle, wore camel’s
hair under-garments, and got grilled at the stake.
But the lawn-sleeved, aproned, gaitered article
didn’t come into use till a hundred years ago.
Whether he did, or ever will, come into
much use, is quite beside the question. We have
Bishop Me.bourne Goe’s authority for the opening
line of this paragraph. Goe held a centennial
service last month, under the appropriate patron-
age of dear Lady Loch. And at that service Goe
preached from the parable of the small grain of
mustard seed, which grew into such a nice tree
that the fowls of the air lodged in the branches
thereof. A pretty simile, dear friends! That
first bishopric took root, grew, and cast forth
many branches. Goe lodges on the Melbourne
branch. It costs £2OOO a year to provide that
particular fowl of the air with his little nest. Let
us hope he will soon have a satisfactory nest-egg
to show for the money. The usual collection will
conclude our service.

It is reported that croquet will shortly

Archbishop Carr, of
Melbourne, told a con-
gregation the other day
that if Mr. Shiels’ Divorce
Bill were adopted it
would “ soon lead to
Mormonism.” A Pro
testant prelate would
never have made such a
statement, because a Pro-
testant prelate would
have spoken from the
standpoint of a married
man. He would not have
implied that because a
way is found for casting
one dov— we mean wife
—out of—that is to say
out of the house of a
man, that man is going
to be such a rampant
lunatic as to straightway
take seven others in.
And if tne Archbishop
happened to be a single
woman (which he is not,
and, probably, never will
be), he would know that
it is becoming a more
heart-breaking struggle
every year to gat bache-
lors to marry, let alone
widowers who know all
about what they will
have to face if they put
their necks in the noose
again. Mr. Shield’ Di-
vorce Bill is more likely
to lead to general celi-
bacy and a rapid decline
of the census.

Mr. Panton, Police Magistrate of Mel-
bourne, has generously offered to paint a picture
for the Sandhurst Art Gallery. The offer is noted
in the Melbourne papers. This was probably the
first intimation most people had that the gentle-
man with red side whiskers who told them that it
was “ five shillings or forty-eight hoars,” was an
artist. By the way, Mr. Panton was the magis-
trate who sentenced Bookmaker Sutton to 11
days’ imprisonment for tapping Lord Beerthirst on
the shoulder, and who had to eat his own sentence
afterwards. We would suggest this scene to him
as a flue subject for a picture, if we thought it
would not be contempt of court.

Marriage is a lottery, and the greater part

other people’s wives, until it seems as it the Aus-

of Hay (N.S.W.), for instance, there live a couple
who some time ago took each other for worse. It
was all in vain that the fond wife salted her hus-
band s claim with the tear of sensibility; he
merely told her to go to Gehenna. He would
come home at night in a state of drivelling
drunkenness, and in a voice that resembled the
tearing of a rag he would whoop out remarks
that sounded like a small boy towing a saucepan
along by a string. At last he whaled the patient,
trusting female, contrary to the usages of polite
society, and then briefly re narking that he was
a hunky boy, he quitted the scene. But she stayed
on. Sooner or later she knew her wandering
partner would return, and each succeeding night
she fancied in her dreams that she heard him fall-
ing into the old mud-hole by the garden gate, and
crawling out with toe old remark that he always
made on these occasions. And at last he came.
There was a lurch and a roar, and something
fell into that peaceful home—something that
smelt like a dirty wet dog and a hogshead, mixed
with cold pigs’ cheek and taturs, and which rolled
on the floor and said it had come to kill some-
body. It was the hunky boy returned. Then the
fond wife fell on his neck and wept. Did she ?
Not much. No, she tied (behind his back) the
hands of the man who bad smacked her, and then
she dragged his clothes mostly off him, and
walked into him a perfect hurricane with a rope,
and rolled him over and welted the other side of
him, and then she finished him off with a dog-
whip, while the miserable victim tried vainly to
claw up the floor and hide himself in the deprhs
of the earth. With a noble moderation the lady
resisted the temptation to scald him for a finale,
but, instead of adopting this extreme measure,
she painted him red-probably with some of the
paint that he had been using to paint the town red
and then, standing him up, she flicked him
about the legs until he fled from the scene. He
didn’t gird up his loins or anything of that kind,
he simply went as he was ; he struck out for the
setting sun with a shriek, and bounded over every-
thing smaller than a Baptist church that came in
his way. Like the vanishing of a broken bubble
he was visible one moment and gone the next,
and all that remained was an optical illusion of a
red citizen spinning 150 feet in the air, and kick-
ing himself as he went to make him travel faster.
Thus, those whom the church had joined were
finally put asunder, and the summer idyll of two
lives comes to an untimely end.

A little romance attached to the last will
and testament of Master in Equity Holroyd. It
was only a fortnight previous io his death (unex-
pected at that time) that the Justice invited a
visit from his fair Victorian granddaughter. Miss
Gwendoline Patton. They had never met before,
and the young lady s c' arma so impressed grandpa
that he codiciled her half nis fortune insteao of a
£5OO legacy originally dotted down on the impor-
tant piece of parchment. According to all ac-
counts Miss Gwendoline is a fresh, smiling daisy,
possessing exceptional rinking abilities. Her
mother is the accomplished Mrs, Patton, well
known in Melbourne as a teacher of music and
singing on a system of her own.

The latest argument in favour of Shiels’
Divorce Bill comes from Paris. A high born
Count, after divorcing his volatile wife, has taken
her under his ‘ protection.” In the early days of
innocence the ex-Countess had to go into hysterics
over a paltry milliner’s bill before it was settled
by the boss. And now he loves her to the exten
of £2OO a month pocset-money. How singularly
appropriate are Swinburne's lines :
‘* Lawful wives, who wear langonrs and lilies,
Big swells never find very nice
As compared with the same little fillies
In the roses and raptures of vice.”

Several British lords of high degree have
been doing California of late, and the abgonadt
proceeds to size them up in a bitter spirit. As a
whole they seem to have been an ordinary lot, and
of very small account. The Duke of Blank was
noted chiefly for a horsey, doggy smell, which
clung to him closer than a brother. He came in a
yacht, and brought with him a lady who was not
his wife. She was tall, gaunt, red faced, and
bony ; but society did not take kindly to her, so
the duke swore a little at the insolence of these
“ blawsted American people,” and joyously sailed
away in his old greasy suit. Lord Sandys was
chiefly noted for the fact that he sat for 15 hours
straight ahead in a restaurant imbibing beers,
with three inches of his trousers turned up at the
feet. He looked like the Pickwickian fat boy in
his calmer moments, but whatever bis mental
state his trousers were always turned up at the
feet. He married a pretty American girl at last,
and then he wheezed in his own calmly corpulent
way over the horizon, and was lost to view. Vis-
count Mandeville was a young man with an erup-
tion on his face and a go-to-blazes manner, but he
would sit and glower amiably at a pug for hours,
and he was popular with the bruising fraternity.
The American pugilists a’l agreed that “it wouldn’t
do to stoush the poor little cove ’cos of his legs,"
which were of the kinky and bowed-down descrip
tion, and consequently the viscount, though he
was cheeky at times, was always tolerated. But
the Argonaut’s list of lords is a lorg one, and as
there is nothing original about the rest, they may
be passed over. They were mostly bowed down
and of bull-pup habits, and the one Ibicg which
amazed them was to find that the world was not
all one everlasting dog-show.

John Taylor, the Mormon prophet, has
handed in his checks, and is now sunning himself
and kicking up his heels on the grassy slopes of
Paradise. We are sorry for Mrs, j. T.—all of her,
for the saint quintupled his blessedness and leaves
behind him a No. 5 widow. The Sydney D.T.
vaguely advances as a cause for his demise, a life
led during the past two years in seclusion, but we,
who have been married once, know better.
When John came home from the club with an
insane desire to put his walking-stick in the key-
hole, and crawled upstairs with his boots in his
coat-tail pockets and the candlestick in his month,
Mrs. Taylor opened out at him with a volley of
bad language from five tongues. When one of
the young Taylors cried in the silent watches of
the night, and John was compelled to take the
floor, four other infantine Mormons waked the
echoes of tire tabernacle and demanded fraternal
perambulations. The prophet doesn’t recollect
the time when he was rot lulled to slumber by
the vigorous curtain lecture, pitched in various
keys of soprano, .of Mrs. T. with an incessant
chatter of five strong. Ten icy cold feet were
planted in the prophet’s back and decupled the
agonies of chronic lumbago, and when he bought
a section of his blushing bride a new bonnet, four-
fifths of her glared jealously with venom in her eye.
A baby’s rattle placated only a small part of his
flourishing offspring, and aggravated a consider-
able quantum of the charming creature who bore
the sacred name of wife, ’these troubles broke
down the prophet's health, and he fell at an early
age the victim of too much matrimony. As
nobody seems inclined to annex his widow in the
bulk, it has been decided by a Parliamentary syn-
dicate to effect a subdivision of the relict and
offer her to enterprising speculators in five subur-
ban lots.

This is a little Kanaka romance of the
deepest dye. A party of coffee-coloured brethren
were about to embark at Cairns (Q.) for their
island homes, when one Jimmie stood up like the
famous George Washington and his hatchet, and
said he couldn’t accompany them because his
heart was in the highlands a chasing the deer and
following the roe. In other words, his mahogany-
coloured Mary had still four months to serve, and
Jimmie was going to wait for her, and then they
would get married and settle down and have a
cottage with three cane-bottomed chairs in the
parlour. Then he went off to lay himself and his
fortune of £lB at Mary’s feet; but, alas I she had
skipped. She had gone off with a brown brother
named Sambo, and Sambo had left an insulting
message with Jumbo to the effect that he could
knock the dust out of Jimmie's loin cloth with a
three-inch plank any time he wished to. And
this was the reason why Jimmie went back to
Cairns and expended his £lB in vanity, and gazes
on the coffee coloured female nevermore. But he
hopes, if the words of the white fellow’s preachy
man are not the baseless fabric of a dream, that
he may one day meet his Mary again in another
world, and find out if she instigated Sambo to
leave that message with Jumbo, or if she was
betrayed, like himself, by Sambo’s fathomless
guile.

The Melbourne Argus consoles poor Mr.
Dakin for all the trouble and expense he has been
put to in connection with the thumping case of
contempt by assuring him that he will for all time
be the hero of a “leading case ” in the law-books.
The Argus says that “ Dakin’s case ” will be
cited in the Courts when Higinbotham, Dakin,
and a lot more have long passed away. This is'
very much like the cheerful information given by
Ko to to Narki Pco as to what will take place
after the Mikado's son has been snickersnee’d
“There will be great festivity, and fireworks in
the evening ; you won’t see them, but thej-'ll take


place all the same.” Poor Dakin’s case wil i
become as famous as “ the case of Sir Colman j
O'Loghlen, your Honor.” Poor Sir Colman
(brother of Sir Bryan) had the ill luck to get into
the Bankruptcy Court in Ireland, and a decision
was given in a matter which cropped up in his
case that has ever since furnished an eternal
precedent Sometimes when Sir Bryan is in an
insolvency case his opponent finds “ the case of
Sir Colman O’Loghlen on all fours, your Honor,
with this.”

Chief Justice Darley
points out that the mere
granting of relief to a
divorced wife is not suffi-
cient. A husband should
be liable to six months’
gaol if it were proved in
court that he ill treated
his wife, lived on her or
her relatives, and de-
serted her. A word in
your little| pink shell-like
ear, Sir Frederick, We
notice that you have said
nothing about the wife
wl o ill-treats her hus-
band—who not only lives
upon him, as she has a
right to do, but brings
her mother-in-law and
other relations to help
him into an early grave.
Having been there our-
selves in a former state
of existence, we are of
opinion that twelve
months wouldn’t fully
meet this latter caee.
No Mayor of Melbourne has yet been
knighted, though several of them, on special
occasions, have striven hard for the “honour.”
The late John Thomas Smiih—who was Mayor
seven times, and used to be called the Melbourne
Whittington—was sent home 25 years ago by the
Corporation to present an address to her Majesty
on the occasion of Wales’ marriage. Smith, who
was an ex-publican and ex theatrical manager,
took home with him as “chaplain ’ the Rev, C.
T-. Perks, of St. Stephen’s Church of England,
Richmond. Melbourne Punch, which was then a
comic paper, had a cartoon representing John
Thomas dreaming sweetly “ a knightly dream ”
which, however, was baseless as most dreams are.
Then J. S, Butters, who was Mayor when Edin-
burgh visited Melbourne, expected to be made
“Sir James," but that didn’t come off, either,
Veares, who was Mayor when the International
Exhibition of 1880 1 was opened, got the beggarly
title of C.M. G, and we don’t hear that “Cain,”
the present Mayor, who, J. D. Carter says, is also
an “ able ” man, is going to get any Jubilee “ dis-
tinction."

At Melbourne, William Rock received six
months’ gaol for trickery and fraud. William was
wont to go in the still small hours of the night in
meagre attire, with blanched face and storm-
tossed hair, waking respectable citizens by
clamouring at their doors for brandy to adminis-
ter to his sick wife or child. Tender-hearted
people, who happened to have a drop by them,
humanely responded to his earnest appeal, and
William slid behind the next corner to pour the
contribution down his neck on top of various
others, out of the reach of the law. Mr. Rock
would then pass in his pannikin a little further
up the street. By these means he managed to get
drunk every night, till the police interfered and
turned off his little tap.

London has gone cowboy mad ever since
Buffalo Bill brought his wild Western show across
j the Atlantic, and accordingly Bill’s rowdy gang
are living in an atmosphere of luxury which no
cowboy ever breathed before. The characteristics
|of a cowboy are few and painfully strong. He is
a foul-mouthed, whisky-scented, unwashed ruffian,
who never learned to read or write or do anything

but loaf about with squaws, Indians, and half-
castes, and round up cattle, who uses six garish
oaths and sundry anatomical expressions in each
sentence, who regards murder as a weakness and
beastly, hideous intoxication as the only manly
amusement of any account. When his nightly
performance is over he lounges over a fifth-rate
bar and blanks the eyes of the tenth-rate barmaid
in attendance ; he also spits freely, and buries his
bloodshot countenance and garbage-laden breath
in bowls of rum, and he talks in a dialect of his
own, which is a strange and awful mixture of
blasphemy, ignorance, impudence, and malapro-
pism. And yet for the time being the cowboy is
the fashion, just as the “representative Aus-
tralian” was before him, but in a much greater
degree. He is to be seen, and, worse still, smelt
at garden parties, picnics, and balls; he spits
at conversaziones, and gets maudlin drunk at
supper parties, and swears everywhere, and
he flirts in his heavy cowboy fashion with
the prettiest girls and for that matter with
the prettiest married women as well. Ladies
of good position visit Buffalo Bill’s circus,
and sit conversing with these grimy, lying herds-
men in their tents over afternoon tea, and then
pay the bill and depart, for the cowboy never
“ shouts.” At least two burly, dingy, blasphem-
ous members of this Indian circus are now en-
gaged to be married to young ladies of good
position and large fortune, but whether they in-
tend settling in England or whether they are
going to take their brides to their dirty huts on
the prairies is yet unoerta’n. There was a
romantic English lady once who went out to that
land of the setting sun as the bride of a converted
Indian, and when she reached his wigwam she
discovered that he had two wives already, but as
accommodation was scanty he kindly strangled
one. The young wife lived here and slept with
the dog for four years, and then she escaped, but
her husband captured her, tore all her clothes off,
and, tying a rope round her waist, made her run
for ten miles alongside his horse. When he got
home he switched her with a strip of hide till he
thought she was dead, but another Indian fancied
she might come round and took her in exchange
for a sore-footed dog. The cowboys’ brides are
not likely to have so bad an experience as this,
but still a husband who at the dinner-table dines
on a roast fowl, which he holds in his hands, and
then wipes his paws on his own hair —or probably
his wife’s—is hardly calculated to make home
happy. Yet it is difficult, after all, to say which
is the more degraded and contemptible—the cow-
boy or the British swell (male or fema’e) who
associates with and pets the foul-mouthed and
malodorous barbarian. Society, after a long
I course of grovelling before a sovereign, has now
come down to grovelling before a mere animal.
The cowboy, on the other hand, has retained his
place in the social scale. All along he was pre-
pared to kick a lady or a king with perfect im-
partiality, and if an emperor gave him any cheek
he would probably gouge his eyes out. And he
remains just where he was, for he is open to
gouge the eyes out of that emperor to-day.

Some Jubilee Tommy-rot from that good
old-fashioned organ, the Sydney Mail :
“No child can obtain one of these medals except by at-
tending on every occasion on which the school has been
open. Florence Dunn has, therefore, never missed a single
attendance for seven years Her Majesty graciously spoke
a few words of congratulation to the. girl, v>ho was brought to
the side of the carriage, and then handed her one of the me-
morial Jubilee mugs. There was a blast of trumpets and a
flag-signal given by the Union Jack called forth the singing
of two verses of the ‘ Old Hundredth ’ by the assembled
children. At a similar flag-signal,* Rule Britannia’ was
commenced, and the singing continued untii her Majesty
had driven out of the Park.”

trumpets,” Blast! What humorists ! What a

Unlike the majority of Civil servants, the
late David Seth Hicks, Inspector of Public Schools,
Bathurst District, was a slave to duty. He got
up from a sick bed in Bathurst to inspect schools
in Orange and never returned alive. He was
most conscientious man, and performed his
allotted task without fear, favour, or affection.
The teachers of his district were not afraid of any
outside influence or favouritism interfering with
their just rights while David S. Hicks was about.
He rose from the ranks, having entered Fort-sDeet
school as a pupil teacher. He married a daughter
of the late John Wright, principal of the Training
Institute, who died some three months ago. Mr.
Hicks was only II years of age.

There are only two courts at the new
Law Courts buildings in Melbourne that can be
disturbed by Dakin’s incessant hammering—
namely, the Insolvency Court and the Criminal
Court, both of which are on the east side of the
pile of buildings and separated from Dakin’s yard
and workshops only by a narrow walk belonging
to the Courts and a low brick wall. The late
Judge Noel, of the Insolvency Court, put up with
the continual noises from Dakin’s place without
having ever once made even a complaint. C. J.

by Mr. J. Macdonald Cameron, M.P., which
justify the belief that a continuation of the Mount
Morgan deposits will be found on the leaseholds
acquired by this Company. By reference to the
map it will be seen that Mundic Creek, referred
to so frequently in Mr. Macdonald Cameron’s Re-
port, comes within the Company’s ground, and the
reasonableness of the large prospective value
which the Directors have considered themselves
justified in placing upon the property becomes ap-
parent. The passages italicised are those bearing
specially upon the leases belonging to this Com-
pany :
Strike and Dip of the Auriferous Zone of Mount
Morgan Proper .
It has been already noticed that the extent of
the metamorphism has made it almost impossible
to determine the exact strike and dip of the ori-
ginal mundic lodes, to which I believe most of the
gold of Mount Morgan is due, and that once
traversed the slatey rocks previous to their altered
condition: bid I have come to the conclusion Taxi
THE MUNDIC LODE NOW TRAVERSING THE BED OF
MUNDIC CREEK MAY BE TAKEN, IN THE ABSENCE
OF MORE COMPLETE EVIDENCE, AS ILLUSTRATIVE
OF THE DIRECTION OP THE STRIKE AND DIP OF THE
MINERAL ZONE OF MOUNT MORGAN PROPER.
Direction of the Strike and Dip of Mundic Creek
Lode.
Roughly speaking, this lode strikes north-east
and south-west, and dips to the south-east.
Auriferous Outcrop of Quartz on the Consoli-
dated ClAims.
About a quarter of a mile west of Mount Morgan
proper there is an auriferous zone on a elaim be'
longing to the Mount Morgan Company, known
as the “ Consolidated,” Its area amounts to
about thirty acres’ Like those metamorphised
rocks that comprise Mount Morgan proper, It is
largely impregnated at the surface with oxide of
iron, and is, likewise, traversed by a network of
quartz veins. This I presume to be the “over-
flow" rock of Mr. Jack’s report. It certainly ap-
pears auriferous, and Mr. Lisle, the manager, in-
formed me that samples taken from its western
boundary assayed I oz. of gold per ton. This por-
tion of the property I shall again refer to, when
describing the extent and aim of the present
mining operations the gold, and
TO SOME EXTENT THE IRON, MAY HAVE BEEN DIS-
SOLVED OUT OF THE IRON PYRITES OF SUCH REEFS
AS THE MUNDIC REEF SEEN IN MUNDIC CREEK, the
gold possibly by chlorine produced by the contact
of hydrochloric acid, derived from the decomposi-
tion of chlorides with manganese which occurs
sparingly in the form of pyrolusite along with the
ironstone of Mount Morgan.
Character of the Sugar Loaf Mount.
If, as Mr. Jack remarks, the silicious sinter
could only be produced in the open air, how is it
that about a quarter of a mile to the west of
Mount Morgan proper it has been found in the
bottom of what is known as the “ Sugar Loaf
shaft," at a depth of about 250 feet from the sum-
mit of the mountain, immediately underlying a
black lustrous quartz, similar in appearance to
that found in the central zone of the Mount?
Either the Sugar Loaf Mount was itself a separ-
ate thermal spring, as it has been suggested
Gallan’s Knob is, that vomited forth its aurifer-
ous contents fitfully for a time in the open air,
and becoming quiescent, owing to a cessation of
the forces that gave rise to it, was ultimately
superimposed by a mass of rock of different com-
position to the so-called sintery mass found at the
depths alluded to, or it is in age, character, and
method of formation part and parcel of the iron-
bound clayey sandstone which is found to the east
and west of Mount Morgan proper. I must con-
fess that my observations incline me to adopt the
latter theory, though I shall certainly differ from
Mr. Jack as to the nature of the method, of forma-
tion.
The intrusions and upheavals that have resulted
in the formation of Mount Morgan proper, have
not by any means been confined to its immediate
neighbourhood ; yet it does not follow that exactly
similar auriferous results will be obtained where
these intrusions and upheavals exist. Previous
to the upheavals by the igneous disturbances that
have also metamorphosed the once stratified rocks
of the district, I picture to myself group after
group of quartz veins of auriferous mundic, vary-
ing in width an richness, traversing and inter-
secting their regular lines of stratification.
Causes that have led to the Metamorphism of the
Rocks of Mount Morgan.
Igneous disturbances follow that distort and up-
heave their once regular masses with abrupt cliffs
and prominences, Their sandstones are converted
into quartzites; their soft arglllo-arenaceous
slates, with their auriferous veins of mundic-
charged quartz, are converted into more crystal-
line and compact rocks, from which every trace
of stratification has been eliminated. Even the
quartz itself becomes more crystalline, and the
sulphur of its contained mundic is partially, and
in some cases wholly oxidised—the extent of this
oxidation being lesser or greater in proportion as
the mass of igneous matter was intrusive or erup-
tive. If the former — -and, my theory on further
examination of the district be found correct-
then the sidphurous condition will continue to
*' make ” the further we recede from the meta-
morphic, until the original mundic lode group is
reached; but if the latter, the metamorphism of
the lode stuff may continue, even to an unwork-
able depth, which would be a matter for congratu-
lation rather than regret, as, in this case, natural
forces will have continued to do for the auriferous
ore of Mount Morgan what would otherwise re-
quire the skill of the chemist, with a consequent
increased cost of treatment.
Mundic Lode in Mundic Creek,
Due west from the shaft of the Sugar Loaf
Mount, there is Mundic Creek, in the bed of which
the mundic lode so often mentioned in this paper
is plainly visible. The direction of its strike
suggests the probability of its yet being cut in the
sugar loaf ground, but up to the present it does
not seem to have been met with.
The Auriferous Zone of the Consolidated Claim.
A shaft known as No. 1 Mundic Creek Shaft has
been sunk here to a depth of 114 feet and at a
distance of about 200 feet from the outcrop in the
creek; but so far as the operations went, up to
the date of my visit no gold had been discovered.
At page 10 I alluded to an auriferous zone
passing through the consolidated claim striking
in a similar direction to that of the Mundic
Creek lode and the auriferous material of the
Mount. It appears to dip at an angle of about
30 to the east of south.
No. 2 Mundic Creek Shaft.
On the western side of the outcrop, a shaft
known as No. 2 Mundic Creek Shaft has been
sunk to a depth of 70 feet, but at a depth of
from 35 to I/O feet the auriferous stone was passed
through, and a grey slatey grit encountered.
Both here and in the Sugar Loaf Shaft the several
lodes and zones dip at very low angles, owing,
doubtless, to the dislocations so often alluded to.
Mundic Creek Tunnel.
Besides this shaft a tunnel, known as the Mundic
Creek Tunnel, has been driven a distance of 200
feet to the N.E, parallel to the strike of this
auriferous zone, but no gold has been encountered
in it. This, I pointed out to the manager, was
due to the tunnel having been driven in the
quartzite country rock to the west, and not in the
auriferous zone itself as ought to have been the
case.
I have now, I think, fully considered the data
collected by me in the short period of time at my
disposal, relative to what I may justly term this
phenomenal gold-yielding property. After con-
siderable and varied experience in almost every
part of the world, I can conscientiously say that
have not seen its equal for the extent and richness
of its auriferous ores. That when the vast zones
of gold-bearing ore that are even now exposed in
the several terraces and “drives ” of the Mount
are considered, our minds are apt to wander into
the realms of imagination for aparallel; for truly
within the realms of fact no parallel has yet, so
far as lam aware, been met with. Whatever
difference of opinion there may exist among scien-
tific and practical men as to the causes that have
produced so large, so varied in character, and so
rich a mass of auriferous material, about the
enormous quantity, the richness and the extra-
ordinary natural advantages offered for the
manipulation of its ores, there is but one un-
divided opinion.
The vastness of the mass even new exposed is
absurdly beyond even approximate computation ;
but are we justified in thinking that this state of
things will continue ? So far as my observations
went I could see no limits; though doubtless
there is one in the same sense as there is a limit
to all things ; and in this connection I may again
quote the Government Geologist: “But the
amount of auriferous stone at present in sight is
enormous, and there is no rashness in believing
that it extends over a large area, and to a con-
siderable depth.” With this quotation, in which
I need hardly say I entirely concur, I conclude for
the present what, from a scientific, as well as a
practical, standpoint, has been to me a most
interesting, a most instructive, and a thoroughly
enjoyable work.

In the London Mining Journal of June Ith,
1887, appears under the head of “ Original Cor-
respondence ” an article on the “ Golden Quartz
Reefs of Australia,” and in a paragraph on
“ Mount Morgan,” Mr. Wm Nicholas, F.G.S ,
says “ Mundic reef itself is really a master lode
over 60ft. in thickness, according to my pacing ; it
extended further, but the thick undergrowth
stopped my seeing its southern bounding wall.
This lode outcrops in the Mundic Creek, and there
are nearly solid seams of mundic (iron pyrites)
within it, as much as five feet in thickness, and
some a few Inches only. But they are sufficiently
numerous to prove this to be of a laminated
character, like the most established or most per-
manent quartz reefs in Australia.”
The vendors to the Mount Morgan Extended
Gold Mining Company, Limited, are a private co-
partnery formed under the name of the “ Mount
Morgan Leasehold Prospecting Association,”
to acquire the leases purchased by the Company.
The members of the Prospecting Association are :
Sir Thomas MTI wraith, K.C.M.G.; Hon. P. Per-
kins ; Hon. William Graham, M.L.C. ; John
Stevenson, Esq., M.L.A. ; John Donaldson, Esq.,
M.L. A. ; Messrs. M. D. M’Eacharn, Edward Grif-
fith, James M'Ghie, J. E. Lampard, Ernest
Goertz, John Potts, Edward Taylor, Chas. H. F.
Yeo, H. May, Alexander M'Micking, William
Allan, De Burgh Persse, and others.
By desire of the members of the Association,
the Hon. P. Perkins visited the leaseholds, and at
a meeting of the members held on tho 21th
August, 1887, in opening the meeting Mr. Perkins
said:
Gentlemen, —By a concensus of opinion among your-
selves I was selected to proceed to Rockhampton, to view
and inspect the leases acquired by this Association, which
are adjacent to the Mount Morgan Gold Mine. I did so at very
gieat inconvenience to myself. On arriving at Rockhampton
after a most disagreeable voyage; I received a telegram from
a very old friend, placing at my disposal a trap and four
horses under the guidance of one of the best drivers it has
been my lot to travel with.
We reached Mount Morgan in due time, and I may tell
you that of all the surprises experienced by me, my visit to
Mount Morgan is the greatest. In place of it being a Mount
by itself it is only one in the chain of ridges, and is no more
a “ mount ” than the surrounding ones.
Very early in the morning we started on foot for the lease-
holds, along Linda Creek, and by a by-path arrived at Cal-
lan's Knob, and visited the different places where work has
been carried on. At Mundic Creek, on the boundary of the
leaees, I saw a lode which is I believe about 132 feet wide.
I took bearings of the surroundings, carefully noted the in-
dications, and returning to the Mount by a circuitous route
I surveyed the situation again.
At Mount Morgan I discussed matters with the manager,
Mr Lisle, who is a mest intelligent man and knows his
business thoroughly. In reply to my query as to what he
was doing on the south-west portion of the Mount Morgan
leases, he said that everything they were working was gob g
in the direction of Callan’s Knob.
I went through the tunnels with Mr. Lisle and came across
three dykes, one of which is about 132 feet thick. An assay
has been made at every few feet of this dyke, and the
average has proved about six (6) ounces of gold per ton
right through.
This lode, is, in my opinion, the lode in Mundic Creek
previously referred to, and I have wondered how it is nobody
took it up. Mr. Lisle agreed with me in my views, but for
a scientific confirmation of them 1 refer you to Mr. Macdonald
Cameron's report : and I unhesitatingly say that while
Mount Morgan is a very great thing, I believe the Associa-
tion’s leaseholds come next to it.
I will admit that all my theories of mining, which work
I began when quite a youth, are gone to the wind. I never
saw gold in such stuff before. Mount Morgan with other
mines is as an elephant compared to a mouse, and the next
thing to Mount Morgan compared with mines in Victoria and
elsewhere with which I am acquainted, are the leaseholds of
which we are going to assume the proprietorship.
I shall be glad to answer any questions the members con-
sider necessary, and will ask Mr. Callaghan to read a report
on the leases written under my direction.
[COPY.]
Report on Mineral Leases, Crocodile Creek,
Rockhampton.
“At the request of several of the gentlemen
forming this syndicate, I have proceeded to Mount
Morgan to inspect the gold mining leases Nos.
75, 77, 81, 85, and 86, Crocodile Creek, Rock-
hampton District, containing an area of 72 acres
or thereabouts, adjoining the property of the
Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company, Limited,
as shown by the accompanying map, and situated
south-west of Mount Morgan proper.
On arriving at Mount Morgan, I proceeded on
foot up Linda Creek (in company with Mr. R. W.
Wilson) to the base of the mount known as Cal-
lan’s Knob, and, after a careful examination of
the strata, I am of opinion that a continuation of
the Mount Morgan deposits will be found in the
leaseholds above mentioned. lam led to this be-
lief after thoroughly examining the lode in
Mundic Creek (measuring about 132 feet in width)
so frequently referred to in Mr. J. Macdonald
Cameron’s report on Mount Morgan, and which,
in my opinion, traverses the whole of this pro-
perty ; lam strengthened in this belief after a
full inspection of the course and dip of the gold
bearing lodes of Mount Morgan, having availed
myself, when there, of the opportunity of inspect-
ing the whole of their workings.
I cannot agree with Mr. Jack that the Mount
Morgan was of itself a separate thermal spring,
and from personal observations I concur with Mr.
Cameron’s opinions that the deposit is of an age,
character, and method of formation, part and
parcel of the iron-bound clayey sandstone,
which is found in the east and west of Mount
Morgan. In conclusion, I may say that lam
convinced that the mundic lodes exposed in
Mundic Creek, and which form part of this pro-
perty, are the same gold bearing lodes now being
worked with such enormous results by the Mount
Morgan Gold Mining Company, Limited, and I
have no hesitation in saying that by the judicious
outlay of a few thousand pounds in actual pros*
pecting, this property will at no distant date be
equally valuable to that of the far-famed Mount
Morgan.”

~ P- Perkins.
i'fth August 1887.
In reply to Mr. Donaldson as to what was to be
done for the future working Mr. Perkins said :
As au economical man, he would get a boring machine.
The exemptions for the leases would expire on the 4th Sep-
tember, but Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Wilson had been to the
Mines Office and got a conditional promise that the ex-
emption of six mouths which was first asked for would be
granted, so that the leases would be really exempt from
work until the 4th November, by which time the new Com-
pany could complete all arrangements, and so avoid the
useless expense that would be incurred if work had to be re
Burned on the 4lh proximo He would recommend that a
diamond drill should be sent up to the leasehold to test the
formation.
A number of resolutions necessary to the for-
mation of the new company were then put and
passed.
In offering for sale the Mount Morgan Extended
Gold Mining Company, Limited, the Directors
wish it to be clearly and distinctly understood
that the Company at the present time is in the
nature of a prospecting venture, and not an estab
lished gold mining property. From the situation
of the leaseholds in relation to Mount Morgan—
in the event of payable gold being found—there
can be little doubt of their immense value. At the
present time the selling price of the shares of the
Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company, Limited,
is about £(! per share or a capital value of
£<5,000 000 ! What then must be the value of the
nearest adjoining property, in the event of satis-
factory results attending the prospecting ?
The vendors to the present Company are the
Mount Morgan Leasehold Prospecting Associa-
tion, who receive no cash f rom the Company, and
who, in addition to conveying the titles to the
leases, will place to the credit of the Company,
with their bankers, the sum of £5OOO to continue
the operations.
Pending the formation of the Company, exemp-
tion from work has been obtained under the
mining laws of the Colony of Queensland.
In offering the shares to the public it may be
pointed out that they are invited to subscribe
shares in an existing registered Company, which
will carry on operations with moneys already pro-
vided, as far as they go, whether a single share bo
subscribed or not.
Dividends will be paid on all shares in the Com-
pany in equal ratio irrespective of the amounts
for the time being paid up on such shares.
The £5OOO at the credit of the Company will be
utilised until moneys begin to be available from
contributing shareholders, and in the event of the
Company going into liquidation or dividing its
assets amongst the members, it is expressly pro-
vided that the uncalled balance of the contribut-
ing shares shall not be called up for the purpose
of such division.
Leases 75, 77, and 84 wei’e formerly the property
of the Callan’s Knob Mining Company, Ltd., and.
some surface work has been done by that Com-
pany, who were compelled to give up from want
of funds to carry on. Rather more than two-
fifths of the shares in the present Company are
held by old shareholders in the Callan’s Khob
Mining Company, Limited, which evinces their
confidence in the result of further prospecting.
Mr. Robert L. Jack, Governmenl Geologist for the
colony of Queensland, has given it as his opinion
that Callan’s Knob affords a very good “ show,"
and in an official report on the “ Mount Morgan
Gold Deposits,” prepared for Parliament (pagesj
and 5), Mr. Jack at some length explains his
reasons for thinking that some portions of the
gold deposits may be found in CMlan’s Knob.
The 500,000 unissued shares will be held for
future issue until it is ascertained that the Mount
Morgan gold deposits exist in the Company’s
leases, when such portion of them as may be
arranged will be sold, and the proceeds applied
in the erection of the most approved modern ma-
chinery, or distributed pro rata amongst the
existing shareholders as may be resolved in
general meeting.
Copies of the Company’s Memorandum and
Articles of Association, and the agreement men-
tioned in clause 3 of the Articles, may be in-
spected at the office of the Company’s Solicitors.

learn that the Queen has, with the greatest diffi-
culty, been persuaded from spending the £70,000
of the English Women’s Offering subscribed for
charitable purposes, on a pearl necklace for
herself.
Bailey’s Sunday News reels off a plaintive
wail over the inevitable advent of Protection, and
lays the blame on the “ soft-goods puppets, the
creatures of the muttonocracy, and the antipodean
absentees who constitute the Government that
have broken the trust reposed in them by the
country.”
The other day the Jesuits at Richmond
(Melb.) got a case of water from the “ miraculous
grotto” of Lourdes (France) sent out to them. At
the Melbourne Custom House the Customs offi-
cers opened the case, examined the bottles, tasted
the contents, and then didn’t know what the devil
to make of it.
From Melbourne Herald ; —“ Arthur
Dowall, a lad aged 15, who resides in Carlton-
street, Prahran, was admitted by Dr. Boyd with a
broken leg.” We would have given something
say a Jubilee medal—to have seen Dr. Boyd
admitting him with a broken leg. No wonder
people complain about the Melbourne Hospital
when the surgical staff open the doors with
broken legs.
Clipped from the Sydney D.T, :
“ The first snake-bite' of the season occurred to a woman
named Butt, at Albury, yesterday, who was bitten on one of
her legs. The part was exorcised, and the patient is now
doing well."
Now, we want to know what was “ exorcised ”
the leg, the bite, or the snake ; or did the writer
really mean “ excoriated” ? Spirits can be “ ex-
orcised,” and perhaps the writer had been exor-
cising some.
“ Samuel Blank was fined £2 4s. lOd. at
the Central Police Court for having used bad
language,” says a Sydney paper. Now, where
does the odd 4s. lOd. come in ? If the beaks at
the Central have a sliding scale of fines, according
to the strength and length of the “language,”
they ought to publish their tariff so that, before
he lets fly, an offender may be able to make up
his mind whether he’ll indulge in tenpenn’orth of
“language” or recklessly go inforhalf-a-sovereign’s
worth.
In the visitor’s book, Tenterfield (N.S.W.)
gaol, Mr. Police Superintendent Orridge has made
the following highly significant entry :
•• u 0 religious service conducted for more than two years
and a half.”
And in another page he has written ;
“ I do nit observe that the gaol is ever visited by any
ministers of religion, so far as the book shows, which is to
be regretted.”
Now there are four “registered’ ministers of
religion in the Tenterfield district. Other entries
show that Captain Rundle, of the Salvation
Army, has held nine services, and it is just pos-
sible that the quartette of clergymen consider that
“ sufficient for the day is the evil thereof” and
that the unfortunate prisoners have already been
amply punished by the Harmy. Prisoners, by the
way, are essentially dead-heads, contributing
nothing whatever to the church stipends fund.


TREASURES are like poppies spread :
You seize the flower, its bloom is shed ;
Or, like the snowfall in the river,
A moment white, then melts forever ;
Or, like the borealis race,
That flit ’ere you can point their place.
But pains and aches for ever tell
There is bat one all-conquering spell;
Before St. Jacobs oil they fly,
And that, the poorest man can buy.
rjIHE BRUSH OB’ BRUSHES.
Owing to the unprecedented success which has
attended the sale and use of Dr. Scott’s Electric
Brushes in Europe, America, and Australia, as
shown by the accumulated mass of unsought testi-
mony to their value, we are now in a position to
offer them to the public at the prices named :

These brushes are all made of pure bristles, not
wire ; the brush handle is made of a new odorless
composition resembling ebony, a combination of
substances producing a permanent electro mag-
netic current, which acts immediately, and the
strength of which can be teste! at any time by
small compass supplied with eich brush.
The hair brushes will positively cure nervous or
bilious headaches in flve minutes, neutralise he
distressing agony of neuralgia, prevent filling
hair and baldness, dandruff, and disiases of the
scalp. They will make the hair grow long and
glo.'sy, arrest premature greyness,. and soothe
the weary brain.
The flesh-brush is said, by the Suroical
Gazette, to be “ better than all liniments and
embro iations ” It keeps the skin healthy, b jauti-
fles the complexion, and imp arts vigor and energy
to ihe whole body.
The bath-brush is one of those contorting de-
velopments of modern science, the value of which
can only be appreciated by unng it. It speedily
cares a'i pains and aches resulting from colds,
impure blood, and impaired circulation.
The Royal Dmtal Society of London testify in
the s rongest terms as to the great benefits which
speedi'y follow the use of Dr. Scott’s Electric-
Tooth Brush, and many experts in dentistry de-
clare it to be the greatest invention in dental ap-
pliances since the manufacture of artificial teeth.
Any or all of these brushes are handsome
toilet accessories, and very durable.
Is you cannot purchase them in your immediate
neighbourhood we will send by post to any part of

SPLENDID STOCK OF WINTER GOODS.
Fashionable Garments to Order at Moderate Prices
I mHK fourth chapter, and end of our self-imposed
I X task. It has been a duty undertaken on
account of those who have so long encouraged us
with their support. It was last Saturday wo com-
menced the essay, and we pledged our reputation
to continue it, chapter by chapter, until we had
: thoroughly exhausted the subject. We thought
; three chapters would have sufficed, but find it
takes four.
Last Saturday’s issue saw the first part of our
essay upon HOW AND WHERE TO FURNISH
THORO UGHLY, S AFE L Y and K JONO MIC ALL Y;
and in that issue, as the result of serious study
and careful deliberation we gave our readers a
the Carpet and Floorcloth floors upon
the 5th storey of the Great Central Emporium,
Sydney.
We omitted giving the address in the first issue,
but do so now, viz., LAWLER’S, 608 George-
street, Sydney. An old-established house, es-
tablished as long ago as 1860, and situate in the
centre of the city right between Liverpool and
Bathurst streets. A commanding and imposing
edifice, and stocked from floor to ceiling
Monday’s issue treated of the extraordinary
stock of bedsteads, wire-mattresees and bedding,
upon the floor of the 1th s .orey; and Wednesday’s
issue dealt exclusively with the Bedroom Furniture
upon the floors of the 3rd storey. And now we
have to treat of the Dining and Drawing room
furniture and Library and Office appointments
upon the floors of the 2nd storey.
This last chapter is the one that claims the at*
tention of our readers, and we will be as brief but
explanatory as possible. LAWLER'S Suites differ
from most suites met with in Sydney houses, and
remind us on account of their solidity and fulness
of upholstery of the suites made before the age for
slop upholstery became general.
We have had our attention called to a magnifi-
cent solid walnut diningroom suite with misletoe
carvings and carved and moulded legs set with
best coppered wire springs, upholstered throughout
in curled horsehair, and covered in the best
Russian dressed real morocco, finished with
morocco binding and morocco-covered studs. The
suite was made for one of our well-known mer-
chant princes and was sold to him for £65. It
looked all out well worth 90 guineas, a figure one
of the furnishing salesmen declared he had re-
peatedly sold the suites at in London, Leeds and
Edinburgh. There is another Suite just being
completed in the factory, the couch and a few
chairs of which we were shown, and we have no
hesitation in declaring it to be the best upholstered
suite we have ever seen. No one with money
could resist it. It is a glorious suite, splendidly
finished and boldly conceived, and only £60. It
would be cheap at £80. We felt bound to admit
that it was stupid purchasing at auction sales
when LAWLER’S celebrated light oak or walnut
or real mahagony specialty—the Emporium
Leather Suite at £27 10s., could be had direct
from the factories In Union-lane. There are
Diningroom Suites all made and upholstered upon
the premises in oak, walnut or Mahogany, and in
crimson or olive Utrecht velvets at £24 10s. and
£<7 10s. And there are mahogany and cedar
Diningroom Suites in the best English made hair-
cloth, or in Cockett’s maroon or green-colored
leather-cloth at £12 ids., £14 10s. and £17. LAW-
LER’S set their face against turning out suites in
hair-cloth at anything less than £12 10s., saying
they would only have to resort to common German-
made seating if they were to manufacture hair-
cloth suites at a penny less than £12 10a.
Our readers ought all to bear in mind the im-
portant fact that they can select their frames at
LAWLER’S and choose whatever covering they
think fit, and can call round at any time and see
the work in the upholsterer's hands.
We would remind those who prefer the Austrian
Suites to upholstered Suites that they can have
one of those grand and luxurious Couches, the
Eugenie, at £3 19s., and capitally suited for an
after-dinner smoke or nap they are. Long and
broad —a perfect nest of spiral springs, the head as
well as the seat being so upholstered.
This Eugenie Couch of LAWLER'S, at £3 19s,
a perfect marvel of value, and to show the esteem
in which it is held we have only to remark that
since LAWLER reduced the price from £5 5s. to
to £3 19s , the present low price—since he reduced
the Eugenics to £3 19s. he has sold 200 and odd of
them, or an average of five a week.
We have no intention of referring to Sideboards
or Dinner Waggons; nor were we inclined to take
up much of our important Saturday’s apace with
Extending and Telescopic Dining Tables, buthaving
been shown a few very special lines we think it
our duty to name them.
Frst there is the Hotel Sideboard, 6ft. long, with
glass back, bracket shelf, enclosed cupboards and
drawers, all solid cedar, price £8 10s. Then there
is the Cottage Sideboard, with large glass back,
collarette cupboard and drawer enclosed, brackets
for ornaments, &c., &c., £11 10s. and £12 10s
There are Cottage Sideboards at £3 15s. and £5
5s. And for mansions a range of best made Side-
boards in walnut, oak and mahogany at £1? 10s ,
£25, £27 10s., £35. Thera are massive Sideboards
in pollard oak with all the latest improvements,
of bold design, faithfully built, with immense
bevelled glass back, cellarettes, &c., &c., at £45.
Bookcases and Cylinder Writing Desks in oak,
walnut and mahogany. Dinner Waggons, in the
same woods.
A grand stock of elegaht Pierglasses and Over-
mantels.
But what surprised us most was the quantity
of Drawingroom Furniture, Suites, Cabinets
Brackets, Tables &c, turned out by LAWLER'S.
The turn-over of the establishment with its
different departments, its wonderful Boot and
Shoe floor, the Furniture, Carpets and Bedsteads,
the Ironmongery and Glass and China, the Drapery
and Clothing and Hats and Caps must be some-
thing extraordinary.
Upwards of 400 Drawingroom Suites turned
out in 12 months, and ranging in quality, style
and price from the simple but serviceable Repp
Suites at £10 10s. to the prettiest and mosj
effective Occasional and Harlequin Suites
Parisian tapestries or plushes at £45.
As in Diniogroom Suites, LAWLER'S will not
turn out anything under £12 10s. so with
Drawingroom Suites, they will not touch any-
thing under £10 10s. LAWLER’S hold that the
customer who pays more than £65 for the pro-
duction of the best of Morocco Dining-room Suites,
or above £50 for the loveliest and most charming
of delighful special things in Drawingroom Suites
deserves to be declared a “Tittlebat Titmouse’
and fit prey for high-toned but unprincipled
furnishing ‘ Oily Gammons.” And we think so
too.
Time and space—that is newspaper space—i
pretty much like time and tide, will wait for
none; so that, although we would like to refer
to Cabinets. Whatnots, Music Canterburys and
a thousand other articles, we are compelled to end
our essay by repeating at its close the words with
which we commenced —viz., that the place at
which to furnish safely, surely, thoroughly,
economically find well is
