THIS PAPER SHOULD BE MENTIONED WHEN WRITING.
“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at Sydney, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpaiell
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis
tinctive Australian National Policy .
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisatidn and Freedom of Statb
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prisdri
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World;
Australia for the Australians;—The cheap
% Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
v cheap European pauper to bti absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to bo a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System - one House to
j be elected by constituencies as at present;
'/ the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land,
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “ nobility. *
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is am aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
■of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
arm has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured : to profit by its example
.and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
■the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin's inaugural
publication its success was assured. It llad at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
'of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper. ' l '
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pomids in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of'illustrations, and they have
now issued The’ Bulletin in an' entirely new
form —printed with new' typo of'improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established .Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception. ,
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
lerusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
■power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
(misery winch now affiicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, aorainst the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise qf
any human authority which,has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised. The
Bulletin will fearlessly and, rutlilossly contend. :
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary' weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns,,of a,daily, pap-r
tissued from the same office. The Bulletin js
mot connected with any other paper, and .'the
■ matter it contains is all specially prepared 'by its
own unequalled staff. . ,| . ~
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted lin Eng-
land, America, and the colonies. ( ...
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
' i Perhaps the (strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in, the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

The Apostacy of J. Bull.
A few days ago Premier Salisbury dropped
a bomb-shell among the Foreign-trade
economists of England by announcing that
their cherished fad was a failure, and that
Britain must return in self-defence to her
policy of Protection. Lord Salisbury is
not, in the ordinary acceptation of the term,
a politician cf high standing. He is the
shining light of the Stupid Party in British
politics, which practically means that he is
the one-eyed man in the army of the blind.
He is a Tory, as bigoted, though more
brainy, than the average of his kind, a
loyalist of an aggravated'type, a Coercionist,
a believer in State Churchism and the
divine rights of property. These things
seiiously discount tlie value of his utterances
but, in spite of all discounts, their significance
is enoimous A few a very few—years ago
no Englishman, for fear of being mistaken
for a lunatic, dared to announce himself
ooenly as a believer in Protection. The
Foreign-trade system was regarded as a thin a-
whose truth was self-evident—like witch”
craft in other days, and the material Devil,
and the propriety of burning heretics, and
slaveiy, and that mysterious End of the
Erii th where men lost their hold upon all
things and fell over into space. Nobody
advanced any visible proofs of its advantages
any more than he collected evidence °to
demonstrate the existence of the sun—La-
the sufficient reason that neither of
them needed any extraneous support.
And now, when even a second-rate
statesman ventures to denounce the
venerated fetish, it shows that there is a
great and awful falling off in the old Free-
trade beliefs Moreover, according to the
cablegram, Salisbury’s confession of faith
was received with general applause by his
auditors who, 20 years ago, would probably
have called for a strait-jacket and wanted to
have him removed to a place of safety
Apparently the British Prime Minister
intended his statement as an intimation of
the policy on which his party will go to the
country at the ensuing election* and he
evidently believes that Protection is a good
enough war cry on which to travel with at
least a chance of success. In all probability
he is correct. In that variety of wisdom
av 1 1 icli makes the political tactician rather
than the statesman Balikbuky in no mean
adept, and he is never likely to stake the
existence of his party on a cause that is
absolutely hopeless.
'* # •
For at least 20 years past it has become
every clay more ami more evident that Free-
trade is a failure, though the slow, dull,
tenacious lii i.r, has been bitterly reluctant
to realise (he fact. llis boasted policy was
established just when the great boom of the
century was beginning. The building of
railways, the substitution of steamships for
the slow, laborious sailing craft of older days,
the invention of a thousand now varieties of
machinery, the adoption of electricity, the
gold discoveries in Australia, Maoriland,
California, and elsewhere which came so
opportunely that they increased the crop of
the precious yellow metal from 50 tons per
annum in the last decade of Protection to
200 tons per annum in the first decade of
Freetrade, the rapid advance of education—-
all these things and many more created a
temporary burst of activity immediately after
the new policy was established, and the Eng-
lish nation ascribed it all to Freetrade, The
obvious fact that other nations which had
not adopted Freetrade were booming in
exactly the same manner and for exactly the
same causes never, apparently, occurred to
any section of the British intellect. The
insular Bull never looked beyond the limits
of his own four seas. lie had adopted Free-
traue ; immediately after adopting it he
started to build railways and steamships, and
the greatest gold discoveries on record had
been made in his empire ; therefore Freetrade
was (he cause of the railways and the steam-
ships and the gold and all the rest. The logic
of Bull is peculiar, and in all the earth there
is nothing that even distantly resembles it.
* # #
Also, the logic which led to the establish-
ment of Freetrade was equally surprising.
Bread was dear in the last days of the old
regime. Britain grew her own food supply,
and the British landlord charged enormous
rentals, to the amount, in some rural districts,
of over £o an acre for arable land, and to
enable him to pay these rentals the pro-
ducer charged high prices for his grain. The
evil lay entirely in the nefarious land mono-
poly, and the obvious remedy was either to
abolish landlordism or to mitigate its evils
by placing cast-iron restrictions on the land-
owners exactions. But to the Englishman
the rights of property are as the divinity
that hedges iu a god. Therefore, he con-
ceived the brilliant inspiration of Hooding
the country with the cheap grain of foreign
competitors who were less burdened than
the British agriculturist, and thus bringing
down rents by making the farmer too poor
to pay them. It was a strange, upside-down
device, and Bull has whooped over it ever
since. The production of wheat wont down
to one-half. Over a million men were
thrown out of employment, and, reckoning
their wives and families, about four million
people were deprived of their means of
sustenance. The purely agricultural districts
of Ireland and the Scottish Highlands—the
regions which supplied the soldiers that
built up Boll’s mighty empire—lost more
than half their population. The country now
produces only 50 per cent, of its own food
supply, while even Holland which is much
more densely peopled—-has a large surplus
for exportation ; and the United Kingdom
is the only great country in the world which
could ho reduced by a six weeks’ blockade to
universal famine. If Britain, for only three
months, loses the command of the sea, her
enemy can make her give up her whole
colonial empire as the price of peace, or
reduce her to a kingdom of the dead. She
has sent away nearly 8,000,000 of her popu-
lation since her Freetrade policy com-
menced, and is now the only nation on
earth which wants to get rid of from
10 to 20 per cent, of those that remain
in order to save them from utter starvation.
Her fanning population has practically
vanished. With the exception of Norway
and Portugal her proportion of men capable
of bearing arms is the lowest in Europe.
She has, in proportion to population, three
times as many permanent paupers as any
other of the great nations of her continent.
The value of the lands of the United King-
dom lias fallen £450,000,000 in thirteen
years. All these evils she has submitted to
cheerfully for the sake of that cheap loaf
which was promised by the Freetrade
agitators of half-a-century ago, and which
did not come to hand.
* # *
That is to say, it has not come in any sense
through the alleged blessings of Freetrade.
The price of bread has diminished through
the introduction of railways and the con-
sequent cheaper carriage of raw material,
which now costs some 10s. per ton for
each 100 miles instead of £3 as formerly,
through the introduction of machinery for
threshing, milling, and other purposes, all
of which are entirely independent of tariffs ;
but the price of wheat, which was to have
been made so low that famine would be
abolished, has not fallen to any serious
extent. Away back in 1834, in the old, evil
days of Protection, the cost of this article
was 465. per quarter. In 1835 it stood at
335. When the great agitation for the
repeal of'the Corn Laws was in full blast, it
fluctuated at an average of about 525. per
quarter. Then repeal came, and the bless-
ings of Freetrado, and it promptly went up
to 70s. The price was 535. in .1850 ; in 1851
it was 725. ; in 1855 it rose to 755. Then it
went to (>9s. Up till 1877 the great reform
did not begin. From 1877 to 1890 were
years of comparative cheapness in this parti-
cular staple, and to counterbalance this
advantage the prices of meat, butter, pota-
toes, eggs, and other articles rose from 50 to
120 per cent. But the average Briton has
been told that from the year when Freetrado
was inaugurated the period of low prices
commenced and has gone on to this day, and
because he has been so informed he believes
the statement with that faith which can
remove mountains and shift real property
into the sea,
* • *
Apart from that cheap loaf which somehow
failed to seriously manifest itself, Britain has
reaped no other visible advantages from her
boasted policy. Her commerce has increased
enormously, but so has that of the world at
large, and her share of the total is practi-
cally the same as before. Her manufactures
have doubled since the introduction of the
new gospel according to St, Cobden, and
those of her Protectionist rivals have in-
creased exactly twice as fast, so that instead
of producing nearly one-third of all the
manufactured goods of the world she now
turns out only one-sixth. Her exports are
increasing slowly, and her imports rapidly.
Out of her 38,000,000 inhabitants no less
than 21,000,000 possess an average total
wealth of about £1 2s. for each individual !
The cry of her “submerged tenth” has
become a bye-word among the nations. She
is the proud possessor, by conquest, of the only
country in Europe which is undergoing a
steady process of depopulation and threatens
to become an absolute desert, and that de-
populating process began with the introduc-
tion of Freetrade, and has been continuous
ever since. Since the curse of Free Com-
petition descended upon her, and she lived
only for the survival of the cheapest, there
has hardly been one bright spot in her
history. And now, at last, even J. Bull
begins faintly to Realise that his gospel is an
empty thing, and that his creed is a failure.
He is the last of the Freetraders, and when
he apostatises there will be nothing left save
the S.M. Herald and the Argus crying in
the wilderness, and the Sydney Daily
1 elegeaph gibbering among the mills of
its dead superstition and over the altars of
its fallen god.
The Returned “ Loyalist ” —Again.
A fortnight ago The Bulletin published an
article commenting on the utterances of Hon.
L. F. Heydon, M.L.C., a Sydney solicitor, who
recently went “ ’Ome ” for the first time in his
life, and came back full of grovel and Imperial
Federation and abject worship of British insti-
tutions in general. Subjoined we print Mr.
Heydon’s frenzied response to these comments
—tiie cry of a strong attorney in his agony
when he is butchered to make an Australian
holiday :
Editor Bulletin. Sir, — Youaecordedmeathree-
coluinn leader last week. To convince a man that
his action is right, nothing is so conclusive as to find
himself denounced by those whose opposition is a
compliment; for the instinct of evil to recognise
its opposite is keener than the instinct of good for
good. And to be called names under such cir-
cumstances is more satisfactory still, asproving
that the mouthpiece of ill has felt wounded to the
quick. Such are my feelings under your extra-
ordinarily rabid attack. I see at once that my
few words at the Economic, simple and natural
as they seemed to me, must have cut very deeply
thc_ unpatriotic, anti-English, Yankec-aping spirit
which your journal affects.
I cannot but wonder if the leaders of your organ
are Englishmen at all ! They write the English
language, but they must be Englishmen of the
sort who sell to the French the secrets of the
defences of Malta, or who, in a war between
England and Russia, would he found in a Russian
regiment. You call me a “loyalist,” and so I
am ; and that is a better name than renegade or
traitor.
Why some English-born men hate their native
land a mystery to me. A Frenchman who
hated 1' ranee and helped Germany would not be
an object of admiration. And when you find a
son calling his parents scoundrels, his father a
coward, and his mother vile, you do not esteem
him. If such a 'man as your’ writer could de-
nationalise himself and turn Russian, he could
then be as anti-British as he liked ; but he must,
in spite of himself, remain a Briton, and so he is
only flinging mud at his own family circle.
To come to your arguments. I said that if
Australia were to emerge, as she must, from her
baby state of slender commerce, &c., the Suez
Canal would be our road to Europe, and that it is
to our gain therefore that England holds on to
Egypt. You allege in reply that Australia will
not have any trade “ for centuries ” (!!), and that,
if we had, we could go round Cape Horn, the
Cape of Good Hope or by the Panama Canal.
The first argument shows you a very poor Aus-
tralian, but 1 leave your readers to judge between
us on that point—as to whether Australia is to
have no foreign commerce “ for centuries.”
In your second argument your geography shows
very weak. From Sydney to London by the Suez
Canal is 4000 miles shorter than by the Cape of
Good Hope, 0000 miles shorter than by Cape
Horn, and 2000 shorter than by the Panama Canal
(when it is made !).
You should have recollected that the Antipodes
of England lies between Australia and America.
Our shortest way to Europe is decidedly west-
ward, not eastward.
In conclusion, I can only say that your anti-
English venom has, in my opinion, already cost
New South Wales .£2,000,000, at least—rather
more, I fancy, than anyone but yourself will think
your journal worth. Your senseless, disloyal
cartoons, being re-produced in the Review of
Reviews, have given Englishmen the idea that
we are all renegades here. They do not under-
stand that your nauseous notions on such
matters are endured by our community for
the sake of the general wittiness of your staff,
and of your good services to the community
nn other subjects. Lies and libels against ns

It is a painful thing to reflect, no matter how
indirectly, upon any gentleman’s accuracy hut
wherever, in the above communication, ’ u..
Jl by don has ventured upon a direct assertin'
Tmk Bulletin hereby contradicts that assertioi*
in the most absolute manner ; and wherever 1 *
states that The Bulletin said anything h, e
paper flatly denies that it said that'thing • an t
wherever he has expressed an opinion Tim
Bulletin is prepared to prove that the sail
opinion is contrary to reason and common
sense ; and wherever he has drawn an inference
it hereby declares that the inference is not onh-
wrong but is also an insult to the human under
standing. In the first place this paper did not
accord Mr. Heydon a three-column leader— the
length of that leader was only two columns
and a quarter. It did not state that Australia
would not have “ any trade” for centuries'-g
stated that it had no trade worth mentioning
with India, Egypt, and Eastern Africa, amt
would have none for perhaps centuries, and th e
difference between this assertion and Mr. Hey-
don’s garbled rendering is tremendous. It did
not even hint that the routes via Cape Horn
the Cape of Good Hope, or the Panama Canal
M ere shorter than that via Suez, therefore its
geography is not “ weak ; ” but it did assert
that Mr. Heydon’s geography was horrible
inasmuch as he described Eastern Africa as
being next to India Australia’s nearest
neighbour. Moreover, it never even mentioned
the Panama Canal, seeing that there never will
be such a thing, and the individual who doesn’t
know Panama from Nicaragua is very near akin
to the one who doesn’t know a dog from a cow
Ihe statement that the conductors of The
Bulletin “must be Englishmen of the sort
who sell to tiie French the secrets of the
defences of Malta ” is hopelessly inaccurate,
seeing that the said conductors are not English-
men either of that variety or of any other* and
in any case no man has authority to say that
another man “ must ” belong to any particular
nationality. Therefore the implication that
The Bulletin is that metaphorical son who
“ calls his father a coward and his mother vile ’
is exceedingly misplaced ; Mr. Heydon, being
altogether wrong about this paper’s father and
mother, trusts to his imagination for his facts,
and then drags the corpse of his own dead
inference around in misguided triumph. The
rest of his statements are equally erroneous,
but life is too short to contradict them in
detail.
# #
The wild astonishment expressed in Mr.
Hevdon’s second paragraph is evidently based
on the w riter’s simple-minded ignorance of the
fact that the world isn’t all English. For his
information it may be explained that the con-
ductors and literary staff of The Bulletin are
partly Scottish, partly Irish, and mostly—
about five-sixths—Australian, but there is no
Englishman among them all—unless it be the
night-watchman or the individual who carries
out the parcels. 1 his paper has employed many
Englishmen at different times in the past, but
with a very few exceptions they have, somehow
or other, been dreary and aggravated failures.
Its experience in this respect is that of the
world in general. Almost all the alleged
“English statesmen of the present day—from
Gladstone right down to Balfour and Joachim
Goschen— are either Irish, Scottish — or Hebrew.
Almost all the great “English” soldiers for
many years past, from Wellington down to
olskley, were or are of Irish or Scottish
origin. Almost all the great “ English ” mer-
chants are Scottish, German, Hebrew—anything
but English. The alleged leading “Englishmen”
who rule these provinces, or who have left a
No. 9 footprint there, are Irish, Scottish, Welsh,
Australians, or Maorilanders. Go through the
list of names — MHlwkaitii, Griffith, Bibbs,
Higinbotham, Gillies, Shiels, O’Loghlen,
M‘Culloch, O’Shanassy, Beakin, Jennings,
Morehead, Stuart, Lalor, Robertson, Buefy,
and any number more, right down to Mr.
Heydon himself, and the English, who for
many years formed by far the largest per-
centage of the population, are in a miserable
minority. There has been no “ English”
sovereign for 400 years ; Britain has been
ruled by the \\ elsh Tudors, the Scoto-French
Stuarts, and the German Guelphs, with a
solitary Dutchman in between, and before their
day it was bossed by a Norman-French race,
and the last purely English king died fighting
at Senlac 800 years ago. The “English”
army which left a great record behind it
in the Peninsula and the Crimea was over
80 per cent. Irish, Scottish and Welsh ;
the contingents furnished by these three
small, unconsidered states have fallen off
enormously of lute years, and every year as
they declined the laurels gathered by the
“English soldiery have grown more sere and
yellow. Ihe “English” force which sup-
pressed the Mutiny was comprised principally
of Scots, Irishmen, Sikhs and Ghoorkas. The
“ English army which conquered A Vales was
composed of Normans and French mercenaries;
that which conquered Ireland was pure Nor-
man, and that which fought at Cressy and
I’oictiers was fully half Norman, Gascon, and
Angevin. ’1 he “ English ” colonial empire was
only acquired when England started to recruit
her regiments in Ireland, Wales, and Scotland.
Even the boasted Waterloo was won by a force
that was only one-quarter English. And for
these and a hundred other reasons which Mr.
Heydon has never heard of, The Bulletin’s
respect for England has always been a very
diminutive quantity. It lias recognised that
little country as the one that did all the loose
whooping of the empire, and absorbed all the
glory, and grabbed all the money, and con-


Once in the Commons Gladstone was dis-
charging a savage philippic against Disraeli who

Therefore, The Bulletin, not being English
either by birth or sentiment, repudiates entirely
Mr. Heydon’s implication that it is a rene-
gade or traitor.” Like Mr. Heydon himself,
it is Australian, but unlike him it is not
ashamed to acknowledge its nationality, and
does not cover itself with ridicule by endea-
vouring to become a poor, bogus, hybrid
English institution. It denies emphatically the
statement that it has gone back upon its
parents ; it is not a parent-farmer, and it de-
clines to take in Mr. Heydon ’s left-off, would-be
ancestors and reverence them. It may, at times,
have gone back upon somebody else’s parents,
Put that is a mere side issue, and has nothing
whatever to do with the case. And, as for the
conundrum “ why some -English-born men hate
their native land,” it hereby gives it up ; not
being English-born the problem is entirely out
of its line. The Bulletin’s sympathies are all
with its own land of Australia, and in every
national question which lies outside that land
it claims the right to sympathise with English-
men, Russians, Americans, Jews, Kaffirs, or
the fish-eaters of Terra del Fnego, just as it
sees lit. It declines emphatically to have its
sympathies measured out for it by the pint by
an Australian solicitor who endeavours to pass
himself off as au Englishman, and fails horribly
in the effort. It doubtless has exhibited that
want of sympathy with England which has so
badly aroused Mr. Heydon’s indignation, but
Mr. Heydon himself manifests an equally dis-
gusting lack of reverence for Timbuctoo, and
the one failing is just as reprehensible, and as
traitorous, and as much to the point as the
other. The picture of the conductors of The
Bulletin fighting in a Russian regiment against
Britain is amusing in its way, but irrelevant ;
being absolutely without interest in either
nation, and having no desire to kill any
“foreigner” who never did them any injury,
the chances of their being found filibustering in
either camp are strictly limited. Also, there is
a certain fire-eating, blood-drinking aspect
about Mr. Heydon’s figures of speech which is
eminently ludicrous. That gentleman’s habits
have hitherto been eminently peaceful and
chiefly devoted to parchment, and his apparent
desire to drop into military language and to
fool needlessly with foreign wars and European
complications is a painful thing to witness.
# * *
“ Between the Australia which sent the
Soudan Contingent and the Australia of The
Bulletin,” according to Mr. Heydon, “Eng-
land sees a perplexing contrast,” and through
this contrast “our borrowing has suffered,” and
the loss to New South Wales is already at least
£2,009,000. The Bulletin devoutly trusts
that this statement is true, and prays that the
alleged “loss” has been much more than
£2,900,000 —that it has been £20,000,000, if
possible. It has always been this paper s
humble ambition that, through its instrumen-
tality, the borrowing of New South Wales and
of all Australia should not only suffer, but that
it should utterly smash, and go to pot, and be
eternally extinguished. The drunkard who
borrows from a pawnbroker, and the reckless
spendthrift who borrows from a shent per shent
money-lender, and the reckless nation which
borrows all she can get from every speculator
who will lend her money, are all equally on the
road to ruin. The spectacle of a capitalist and
a man of thrift lamenting because his country-
men are not plunging more deeply in debt, and
struggling to liquidate a bigger load of interest,
and crushed down by a larger mountain of
embarrassments, is an uncharitable spectacle.
The tendency to rely, not on ourselves, but upon
the English loan-monger, is the canker that is
eating into the heart of the Australian nation, and
Mr. Heydon solemnly curses this paper because
the disease isn’t further advanced. He complains
with a bitter lamentation because Australia
doesn’t owe more than it does, and in a certain
sense The Bulletin feels sorry —that is to say,
it feels sorry because Mr. Heydon doesn’t owe
a lot more than he does, seeing that he is the
only Australian on record who seems to hunger
after debt and financial trouble. And because
of this tendency on his part The Bulletin
hereby apologises if it has, in any way, pre-
vented Mr. Heydon being personally squashed
beneath an avalanche of liabilities, for if there
is even one Australian gathered together who
wants to owe a great deal of money he assuredly
ought to owe it without any outside interfer-
ence. But these unborrowed millions are not a
loss in any sense unless Mr. Heydon proposed
to borrow them and then repudiate the liability ;
the man who hasn’t succeeded in pawning his
shirt has not “lost” the sixpence which he might
have-got for it so long as the shirt itself remains.
And, moreover, the implied statement that
The Bulletin’s nefarious influence has raised
the price of money is a disgraceful exhibition of
ignorance ; the interest on New South Wales
loans dropped the very year The Bulletin
started, and has never gone up to anything
like the ancient figure since. pro-
vince of the olden days used to pay 5 per cent,
interest on loans that were floated at the
ruinous minimum of £B5 10s.,and at that hideous
rate the province could borrow nearly every
cent in Britain to-morrow. So the only one of
Mr. Heydon’s statements which presented even
a shadow of reason or probability goes with the
rest, and among them all there is not a solitary
shred or vestige of credibility left. _AII is
drivel and ignorance and vexation of spirit.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Some Insurance Matters.
The famous law-case in which the National
Mutual Life Association is wrestling with the
widow of one of its dead customers with a view
to repudiating its liability under the policy,
suggests once more the urgent necessity tor
legislation on the life-assurance question. V\ hat
is wanted is a cast-iron enactment whereby
every company issuing life-policies in Australia
shall be bound to do so without any reservation
whatsoever or else go out of the business, so
that every policy, when once issued, shall ie
made absolutely incontestable by Act of larha-
ment, and when any person dies leaving behind
him a policy which has been duly kept in force to
the day of his death, the payment thereof shall
be just as inevitable as the grave and a great
deal more so than the Day of Judgment, the
conditions of life-assurance have been greatly
liberalised of late years in Australia, chiefly
because it has come to be recognised that a
company which tries to dodge the widow and
the fatherless almost inevitably spends in law-
costs six times as much as it saves, and commits
slow suicide into the bargain ; but still there
remain a few offices which pursue the old, short-
sighted policy whenever occasion offers. And
the gruesome injustice of this system lies in the
fact that they never, or hardly ever, repudiate
the contract while the insurer is alive and a
source of income, but lie low till he is dead, and
then, having obtained from him all the money
that they can get, they keep the premiums, and
deny the claims of the bereaved family on the
ground of some misstatement which, quite
possibly, was purely accidental —in the ori-
ginal proposal. In many cases the agent tills
up that document, and makes loose statements
as to his client’s general health on his own
responsibility, and then rushes the victim into
signing a paper which he has not taken the
trouble to read. In other cases, he declares
himself to be in good health when some fatal
disease is upon him, simply because he is
absolutely unaware of his condition ; and the
examining doctor fails to discover the discrep-
ancy, in which case the doctor is much more to
blame than the deluded customer. \et, in both
instances, the company reserves to itself the
right to take all the premiums it can get,
and then make no return for them
whatsoever, and one or two companies -
fortunately not more—still exercise that right
when fortune permits. This system of putting
the entire responsibility upon the insurer is
eminently one-sided and unfair. The company
should make the most searching inquiry possible
into the client’s condition before effecting the
insurance, and if, despite these precautions, it
accepts a lunatic, a consumptive, a leper, an
individual with yellow fever, cancer, Bright’s
disease, brain-softening, or any other complaint,
or any other dozen complaints, it should be
bound by a cast-iron law to pay up at his death
in the same way as it pays up over any other
healthy client. "If the insurer commits suicide
the day after his proposal is accepted, it should
make not the slightest difference ; if he blows
his brains all over the proposal-form two minutes
after the company has signified in the usual form
that it has closed the bargain, the document —
with the brains upon it—should still stand.
The loss to the company under this system
would be nil, for the would-be suicide, who is
collected enough to insure his life in advance so
as to make a profit by dying, never suicides ;
and the company loses far more in law-costs
and ill-fame by bouncing the consumptive’s
widow out of the money than the money itself
amounts to. Also, its conscience, if it has one,
would feel better, for it is a mean thing to deprive
a widow, even by strict legal process, of her
only sustenance, and by reason of this practice
more than one large insurance company that we
know of should be afraid to die for fear of a
hereafter.
A Law-Abiding Citizen.
For some hidden reason one William James,
evidently a law-abiding citizen, was permitted
to break loose the other day in the columns of
the S.M. Herald as follows :
Allow me in your columns to say nearly every week we
can’t help noliuiny that a house or houses has been broken
into in the city or suburbs, valuable things taken, as they
enter in by the back or front. Now, Sir, I would suggest
that every burglar that is caught flogging should be
enforced, not be sent to gaol as at present. If they had a
good flogging, we may hear very few housebreaking.
Hoping some one will take this matter up, as it is
important
The grammar of William James as exhibited
above is a horrible thing to look at, but his
logic is even worse —much worse. Yet the
reasoning of the aforesaid William is that on
which the apostles of the triangles and the
gallows have always travelled. It is asserted—
without any proof—that flogging would put
down burglary, and that is a sufficient reason
why it ought to be applied. And it is equally
probable that flogging would put down such
evil practices as loafing in the street, dropping
banana-skins on' the' pavement, giving shore
weight, selling unhealthy meat, and writing
ungrammatical letters to the daily press, and,
therefore, by exactly the same logic, it ought
to be applied in these cases also. If the fact
that a certain punishment would —or might—
abolish a certain crime is a satisfactory proof
that the said punishment should be enforced,
then the rule is capable of indefinite expansion.
Probably, a slow process of boiling alive would
do quite a lot to extinguish embezzlement,
if it were extensively used, and by James
process of reasoning it ought to be used ac-
cordingly. Also, if flogging would put down
burglary why not try flaying and branding as-
well, which would, without doubt, be equally
efficacious? Imprisonment lias failed to abolish
house-breaking, therefore, according to the
Herald’s bloodthirsty correspondent, flogging
ought to be tried as a further resource. Also
imprisonment has failed to abolish bigamy,
wife - desertion, assault, attempted suicide,,
cattle, horse, sheep, and dog stealing, larceny,
ditto by a bailee, vagrancy, breach of the
Customs Act, forgery, furious driving, drunken-
ness, gambling, cruelty to animals, obstructing
the highway, being a suspected person, refusing,
to pay tram-fares, defamatory libel, dis-
turbing a congregation, contempt of court,
giving unstamped receipts, and hawking with-
out a licence therefore flogging ought
to be tried in all these cases. Also,
hanging has failed to abolish murder, conse-
quently the assassin ought to be flogged before
being hanged, and, if that doesn’t succeed,
he ought to be thumbscrewed dislo-
cated°on a rack into the bargain. Further, up
to date, no crime has been suppressed by
any punishment yet invented —therefore, all
criminals should be flogged, beginning with the
big bank embezzler who steals, as a rule, forty-
times as much as any burglar. And, if flogging
doesn’t suppress them, then they might all to be
hanged, and if hanging doesn’t do it, then they
should be burnt alive, and if that fails—well.
there are a lot of possibilities in Mr. James’s
theory, but even it is incomplete, and what to
do with a man after burning him alive we don’t
know.
“ At great personal inconvenience ” the leading
land-boomer of Victoria has gone to San Fran-
cisco, at 24 hours’ notice, en route for London,
where he will endeavour to “reconstruct” a
land company once known as “ Hen uy Arnold
& Co ,” and recently and at present called by
the depositors and shareholders in Great
Britain and other foreign parts, “The English
and Australian Mortgage Bank, Limited.”
“ Henry Arnold ” was a pleasant conceit of
the knightly land-grabber who sought to bestow
on his offspring the immortal honour of com-
municating their sweet front names to a land
limited company which bought suburban pad-
docks from cow-keepers and cabbage-growers
by the acre, and sold them to working-men at
per inch. The way the title “ Henry Arnold”
disappeared and “ English and Australian
Bank ” went up, in gold paint and a brass-plate
live by two, marked the beginning of the end
of the maddest and unsoundest system or
scheme —bother the libel laws—of “financing”
the world has seen since John Law, the
daft Scotchman, caught speculative Europe by
the throat and hurled it into a heap in the
corner. The English and Australian Mortgage
Bank bought paddocks on long terms, paying
down on the contract moneys raised in Inver-
ness and Stirling and Paisley and Aberdeen, ye
ken, at 5 and 6 per cent, for two and three
years. The game was lively while it lasted.
The English and Australian Mortgage Bank was
followed by two dozen other “ banks ” (Heaven
forfend we shall ever see their like again) which
bought and sold one with the other paddocks
and swamps and orchards till Melbourne spread
out and nearly lapped up Kilmore and Bacchus
Marsh and Nar-nar-goon. And at “much
personal inconvenience ” the arch-financier, who
knew as much about finance as Bloom and
Douglas do about yachting, has gone—gone at
a crucial period when hundreds of widows and
orphans and unemployed curse and curse and
curse again the land-boom of Melbourne of
1888, whose author has received from his
Sovereign Queen the distinguished right to call
himself K.C.M.G. and to do—well, the dis-
appearing trick.
The average woman, who finds herself
alone in the world, could earn her living if she
could cook—but she can't! ” —Max o’R.exl.
According to witnesses before S.A.
Factories Commission, the of female

Patrick Toole was killed at Ivoroit, Vic.
last week, through lightning striking his steel
watch-chain; he had just previously been warned
by his sister of this danger, which he pooh-poohed.
Little Beyers, a few days ago, told the
present writer that, up to date, there is nothing
to rave about in the new find at Hill End, which
-consists of about four inches of stone, with fan-
gold at a deeper level than previously worked,
and with more stone making off the footwall.
Even amongst practical modern mining men
there are so many liars that it is a somewhat,
gratifying change to got the truth in a frank,

The Last Days of Autumn,
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
O’er paths that were scorched by the burning of
midsummer suns spurred by flame,
Mild April—her mission discerning—on wings of
a mystery came
Came like an angel of morning, soothing the scorn
of the rays
That lately had tarnished the lawning and blis-
tered the breath of the days ;
And herbs that had pined for the kisses of blithe
April breezes and showers,
And had languished in parched wildernesses for
the solace of soft, dewy hours,
For a brief moment greenly upspringing welcomed
the sweet, mellowed breath
Of the cool, sunny month softly singing the tidings
of late summer’s death ;
Heedless the incoming changes, the gleam and
the tinge of the scud
Dim drifting at times o’er the ranges, or the
hollow vines fringing the flood,
Or the evenings anon that grew dimmer when
weary old age smiled and sighed
At the flight of the birds and the glimmer that
told how the sunlight had died.
But April soon fled from the meadows—turned to
the westward and fled
At a sign that she caught from the shadows of
twilights that shelter’d a dread—
Fled with her fancies forsaken, her mild beams of
lustre and light,
From flowers and fronds overtaken by omens and
shapes of the night,
And May, like a wraith that applauded the
promise of winter at least,
Came in a vision disordered by winds that had
swept from the east —
Winds that were loudly abusive— fraught with
such warnings as state
The issues of struggles adducivo when Natures
wild phases debate —
Wet with the speech of an ocean that fiercely afar
moans and prays .
That land-storms in raging commotion will darken
the last autumn days—
Despite the brave gums and the box-trees that,
sentries o’er gorges and gaps
Where the tremors of tumult hold orgies, groan
for the season’s “ mishaps. ”
Expectancy shuddered a-sighing, for mist-clouds,
whose errands are frowns,
Mouldered the russet-leaves lying in gardens and
parks of the towns,
And gamuts of boughs that had hearkened to
signals impassioned and grand —
The prologues perturbed and sky-darkened that
spirits of wrath understand
Grew silent and shrunk at the “blinking ’ of
moods that were bitter and chill
With the phases of ice-phantoms “thinking” m
sight of the bleak, barren hills.
So, in dews that were acrid and eager, breaths of
a keen, nipping sting
That palsied the growth of the grasses and har-
rowed the birds on the wing,
'The last days of autumn evanished—like those of
poor humans opprest,
That, victims of rigours, have perished, or, hap-
less, are laid down to rest.

816 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, May 25, 1892.
Mr Dear Moorabinua, —
Another era of fascinatingly-draped neurosis dawned
behind Mrs. Bernard-Beere, at Sydney Royal,on Saturday,
when many wept right through the four acts. Judging
hi the Society drama it has gone out of fashion to exhibit
one’s upper outline, but they make up for that in the
skimpy skirts—the merest neophyte couldn’t be made
believe that a woman tapered off to a mermaid’s tail
after he had witnessed Madame B. posing in that yellow
tea-gown, for instance. In the first act Lena Despard
wore a frock of a cut that never was seen before, by me,
at least, on sea or land—it had as many flaps to it as a fire-
screen, and where the fastening was opera-glasses utterly
failed to discover. This mystery was mainly snow-white
velvet with sleeves, panels, and so on of black velvet and
jet in lace-like designs—like splash-work on white paper,
the whole topped off by a three-cornered hat of white
velvet and black jet, long Sitode gloves to the elbow. The
next scene goes up on a dancing set revealing Miss
Urquhart with her black hair arranged « fa unicorn and
wearing a seductive tea-gown of scarlet silk and black
fringe, made with a round bodice and the skirt pulled on
—a style which seems to threaten that short waists are
coming in. In this act Lena’s garment is a sartorial
triumph. The left side of the elbow sleeves are of old
gold fringe, giving the effect of mail, the long round
train and right side of the dress of yellow china silk
bordered round the sleeves, Medici collar, and all with
yellow ostrich feathers ; diamond brooches.
Act three reveals Mrs. Beere in a bilious tan velvet
bodice and demi-train with skirt and folded front of tan
silk , the petticoat slightly looped to show a pink ruche
underneath, zouaves of tan passementerie—in the last
groan a red silk negligee with gauze sleeves and passe-
menterie skirt panel—the whole thing obviously worn to
create a “ scarlet woman ” effect. The audience easily
believes you’re a sinner if you confess it all in something
the colour of a fire-engine. By the way, Mrs. Beere gets
up her visage ever so much better than Bernhardt did
hers. One great thing seems to be that she paints her
eyebrows not with the usual coryphde streak of Indian
ink, but a sort of ferret-red, and the eye make-up (over
which so many mummeresses come to artistic grief) is
almost imperceptible.
There was a fashionable gathering for the ptomtere, and
everybody liked the new and festive act-drop—white and
amber curtains disclosing in the centre a well-painted
view of goodness knows where—even Mr. Gordon, who
painted it, isn’t quite sure of the locality’, I believe. Any-
how, there is a church in the background and a picturesque
peison fishing in front—Manager Goodman, perhaps
so maybe the scene represents Woy-VVoy. In the
audience vice-regality was represented by 'a couple of
aides in a side box, one of whom was ridiculously like the
little Juggins of the first act, though he didn’t seem to see
the fact, but thrust his profile out of the box while people
compared at their leisure. I notice that the d.c. always
prinks its plumes when a “society” actress is about—
women don't want their husbands to draw unfavourable
comparisons, I suppose-and on this occasion there was
little to cavil at. Grey-and-gold was well worn by a dark
woman ; Carrie Swain was in cloud-grey and pink,
diamonds on the corsage and in the hair, opera cloak of
grey with silver-broidered yoke; Miss Bensusan, in
golden-coloured silk with trimming of yellow feathers—
but I didn’t admire two girls in black gowns with chemi-
sette tops of flame-red—they were too fatally like a pair
of red-hot pokers.
In my opinion, Mrs. Bernard-Beere made her real
Sydney ddbut at Mrs. (Mayoress) Manning’s reception,
given in her honour, in the Town Hall, the other Friday
—because that is the 'time society sizes up the latest
lioness-samples her roar as it were-and decides whether
it is going (always provided, you know, that she is agree-
able to the process) to make an afternoon-tea idol of her
or not. Mrs. 8.8.’s initials don’t suit her though, for
in the art world “ B.B.” stands for very soft and black
and Mrs. 8.8. is thin and fair, with a transparent skin
untouched .by cosmetics off the stage, so, of course, she
didn’t wear a Potter veil in her wide-feathered hat. A
pair of cold, clever, grey eyes set rather deeply in a white
face, which a long course of emotional drama hasn’t left
altogether unmarked ; fair hair loosely dressed-loose
dressing lower down, too—a tea-gown scooped out deeply
round the neck, made of a pale tan-coloured stuff
trimmed with ribbons and yellowish guipure—and sug-
gestions of pink velvet here and there; in the weird
wardrobe of this latest luminary there is no such thing
as corset. Metaphysically, Mrs. 8.8. is an individual
who might even make your flesh creep—she isn’t the
sort of stage vision to be loved all round-but you must
follow her about with your eyes. She possesses strange
magnetic attractions-you could feel anythin"- for her
but indifference.
The reception was small and successful, and the usual
thing, of course. Mayor and Mayoress Manning with
the star between ’em, received in fhc Mayoress’s rooms-
the way thither being made bowery with palms and tree
ferns. There was a little excellent organ-grinding after
c\ cry body had clawed the trio dc reception— cakes and
ale were conveniently adjacent, and nobody had a con
spicuously new frock on, with the exception of the
May oress, who wore a wintry, workmanlike dress of dark-
ikie cloth ; Mrs. Burdekin in a Parisian gown of black
bonnet to match, and Miss Burdett Smith also in mourn’
mg. Mrs. Van. Greene (who goes to Milan in June to
study acting and grand opera-all success to her!) - Col
and Mrs. Spalding ; Mr. Forbes Angus ; Judge Windever •
Mr. Town Clerk Daniels; “Cupid” Smith ; Mr. and Mrs’
Tom Slattery; Mario Majeroni (by the way, why docs ho
always come under the protecting wing of some matron
or other-can t he toddle by himself ?), all turned up to do
the Beere reverence. But what a shocking absence of the
mumming fraternity. Surely they were not invited !
The general—er—eccentricity of woman’s ways of doing
business and the calm integrity of her glance are two
things that lam sure men find difficult to reconcile. But
it ig when she starts handling big sums of money in her
artless way and behaving with public funds in a mann'e'r
that would set a detective on the heels of any mere man
in two twinkles, that woman shows her peculiar genius-
witness bachelor Haimes’ will-case, which is affording
imany legal pickings in Victoria. Twelve thousand pounds
was willed to Colao Ladies’ Benevolent Society, and you
may be sure it was quickly appropriated—but just as the
society had digested the last nought a lady, next of kin to
the benefactor, arose to complain that there wasn’t any
sirch society to leave the money to, and that, as the
Society wasn’t visible to the naked eye at the time old
Captain “ Mamre ” died, she ought to get it; so there!
Everybody looked at the defendant then, but it (the
society) was equal to the emergency. “ The society Con-
tended that it had never ceased to exist, but admitted it
had not always carried on active operations for want of
funds.” It was a ladies’ society, and no matter whether
grass sprouted from the chinks in the prospectuses, and
you couldn’t see the secretary for blue mould, and no
female was ever heard brokenly blessing the Society for a
blanket honus—yet when somebody left it £12,000 it
grabbed with both hands, weeded the toadstools from the
signboard and started off again as if there had never been
a shutter up. It was a ladies’ society, and the puzzled
Judge “reserved his decision.” No wonder !
The fact, of course, is that most of these “ benevolent”
societies are only used as means to enable flinty-hearted
aspirants for “Society” distinction to pose as Lady
Bountifuls at other people’s expense.
There is at least one white-skinned fatalist in Australia
■ a young- and handsome professional man (interested in
the rabbit-question, by the way), who regularly shuts
himself up on his “evil day,” lest anything dreadful
eventuate. He does it because one year, on the baleful
date, he was out driving with his wife, when the horses
bolted and the wife was killed. His mother-in-law was
along, too, and she had her neck broken. The next year,
on the same date, he broke his collar-bone by being thrown
out of a coach ; after that two years elapsed, and on the
fatal day he unthinkingly took his sweetheart for a ride,
and her horse threw her against a tree and she was killed.
So now, when the dreadful morning dawns, he stays at
home and lets the Fates have it all their own way. But
hasn t Mark Twain pointed out how dangerous it is to go
to bed—so many people die there!
I begin to think that the musical societies are wrong in
paying heavily for the best available talent to “assist,”
for it does not “ assist ” them at all. It fills the hall, of
course, but when things are more or less complimentary
that fact doesn’t smooth one furrow from the Treasurer’s
baby brow. Instance—Sydney Liedertafel’s 62nd concert
in Centennial Hall the other night, when basso Fob and
tenor Harley sang in all five times, and people actually
fidgetted when the society was chanting- its melodious
lay in between. The audience seemed to want one star at
a time, and got dissatisfied with the milky-way, as it
were; but without doubt the soloists threw the choristers
into the shade. To engage overshadowing talent under
such circumstances is to produce much the same effect
upon the audience as when a parcel of amateurs import a
real actress to help them along.
Last Sunday evening, Madame Charbonhet-Kellermann
ga%e a musical “at home” at her new residence
Ganala, Potts Point, to a crowd of people, and great
was the success thereof. Madame, in a black silk gown,
played her brilliant “Myosoli” valse de concert, and
divided honours with M. Poussard for the Beethoven
sonata, charmingly rendered by both artists. Deslouis
was in tip-top voice, and sang “ Alleluia d’Amour ” and
Les Rameaux with much force and feeling, and
Madame Merz and Dr. Laure also lifted up their voices in
song. After which, light refreshment occurred in the
dining-room, and the gratified guests dispersed before
twelve.
Signor Foil and tenor Harley were entertained at a
musical soiree on the same evening in Darlinghurst. I
hope the fashion grows. Sydney will become an amusing
place to live in even on a Sunday in that case—but of
course j our clergyman thinks such amusements wicked.
So would you, if you had a plate to fill.
The Bland Holt Co. left by land for Melbourne, on 20th
inst., after a successful season, and a crowd of admiring
fiiends greatly' impeded the porters in consequence.
Mrs. Bland Holt travelled over in a gown of carubia
serge, three-cornered hat en suite , and there was a steady
fusillade of flowers all round.
What a pity, wasn’t it? that that lively Southern
divorce-case didn’t come off before the Sydney Pincushion
Fair ! The lady, her husband alleged, was in the habit of
throwing baby down on the floor and sticking pins into
it and when remonstrated with insisted that it liked it! If
this is true (though the yells of the cherubs if thej' feel
a pin-stab in business hours make a vague and misty
spinster have her doubts) what a lovely original pincushion
an enterprising girl might have sent in! Borrowed
somebody’s baby —draped it carefully and written
“Welcome little stranger” in pins on—well, anywhere
Wouldn’t that have been a howling novelty ?
The season of “sports” is upon us again, and thrice
last week was the Association Ground filled to the roof
with the excited populace. Sydney High School sports
Sydney ’Varsity ditto, and pay-at-the-gate bicycle meeting
eventuated in their written order, and at each one the
dispersing congregation resembled a riot on a large scale.
At the ’Varsity sports the girls were as thick as leaves on
a tree, and some of the costumes were quite fetching ■ but
the lady in flame-coloured silk cap-k-pie, and the other
charmer in very short skirts and dirty boots mustn’t
count themselves in with the compliment. At the
“gate” cycling on Saturday, it wasn’t all harmony, I
belieie. The local wheelman who whizzeth round the
track for the glory of the thing (and, perhaps, a little
bangle for his best girl thrown in), has a “down ” on the
“cash-amateur” who shares in the “gate,” but won’t
publicly say so, and out of that a feeling of unpleasant-
ness broods in the air and spoils the sport. The animosity
of the “real ” amateurs who were fringed round the Lawn
fence was awful to contemplate.
Apropos Mr. Hoyle’s impeachment of the Baldwin
engines—don t you think it rather interesting that His
f 0 X ’t ? VaS haUled t 0 and fl '° m Wud " ee one of another
The latest fashionable drawing-room game is “ puttim*

Lady Patti.—(As Told to tke Newest
Jackeroo.)
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The sombre nightshade darkens the golden light of
sunset,
Ihe birds are hushed, in slumber oack little
songster rests,
Hie cricket sings her loudest, and bullfrogs in the
streamlet
Are serenading lady frogs (to me they’re perfect
pests);
You see now the rising -moon hot* silver ‘footsteps
lighten
r J hat bunch of trees down on yon flowery
creek—
Well, a lady comes and sings there, my solitude to
brighten,
I m expecting her tnis evening—she came every
night this week.
You want to know who is she? That’s more than
I can tell you ;
I’ve never gazed upon her, although I’ve hoard
her sing.
Don t smile like that, dear fellow, ’tis not my wish
to sell you;
Where no one lives for miles around it seems a
curious thing.
What songs she sings ? Well, there again, I do
not know, for to me
’Tis an unknown tongue, yet melody can speak
in language plain,
And the plaintive notes from yonder copse tend
ever to endue me
With a feeling deep and longing, almost akin to
pain.
Dor she sings a song of blighted hopes, of weary*
lonely waiting
Of faith that’s dead, of loved ones gone, 'Of ‘days
both dark and sad-,
In tender notes appealing, in mournful tones
relating
Some tale of Wrong, some mercy asked, were
Justice to be had ;
And in my heart a yearning that’s ever growing
stronger
Goes out to Lady Patti (I’ve named the singer
so),
Her wrongs shall all be righted, she shall not
grieve much longer,
My arm is strong, I will restore her banished
peace, somehow.
I m lonely here, if she would come her every grief
and sorrow
(Though she’d drained the dregs from out the
depths of ail misfortune’s cup)
Would vanish, and would dawn for itte a peaceful-
glad to-morrow,
For I’d shoot that nveet-iViced 'dinrjd, tike I 'did

THE LATE BARCROFT H. BOAKE.
Somebody writing to a Melbourne papeb
on the subject of tram-fares assumes that the
lease of the local Tramway Company will be
renewed at the end of 30 years, “as it is well
known that the Municipal Councils will never
give us such an efficient service as we have under
the Company s regime .” The correspondent is
evidently a young- and far-seeing shareholder in
tbe present monopoly, but he protests too much,
i üblic opinion has not yet rejected the possibility
of a successful change of Melbourne Tramways
government in Anno Domini 1922.
The other day, at Jerilderie (NSW) a
boundary-rider named Anderson died a horrible
death through exposure, insect-bites, and ex-
f .° n; ?if attempted to rescue some sheep
bogged in the vicinity of a tank, and became
bogged himself in the effort. Then apparently
the poor fellow cried out off and on for something
wnn| aC nd ii tl]l . he became hopelessly
weak, and finally his remains were found sitting
up in the slime where he had shrieked himself to
death some six hours before assistance arrived.
A hospital scandal is announced from
Gooktown (Q.) A Chinaman was bitten on the
leg by a snake. His mate cut off his pigtail and
tied it tightly above the bite, and then got a cab
and sent the Chow to the hospital. Arrived there
m a dying state he was refused admission, pre-
sumably by reason of some red-tape or other, so
the cabman galloped round to the police-station,
the police referred him to Dr. Korteum, but the
doctor was out, and the unhappy Chow died,, and
the distracted Jehu fled back with his remains to
the hospital, and what became of them after that
the telegram sayeth not.

The beautifully - habited Mm. Bernard
Beere appeared at Sydney Royal on BatutdW
night in the drawing-room melodhiffia, Of ‘‘As Ih'l
Looking Glass,’ adapted by ah ahonymohs plait
wnght-wi,o is not alluded to ih the bills-ftE
novel of the same name. The liohsfe Was gbnuiheH?
crowded m every sectiorl, and thebe was much
evident intention on the part of the audience to
be «thetacdjy lifted off its feet whenever an
excusable opportunity presented itself. The nhv
.n question strikes the unprejudiced mind as pain
fully improbable The leading lady is a mixture
of many kinds of heroine, in whom the recently!
deceased Mademoiselle Marie Bashkirtseff has the
lion s share of cynical sentimentality and material!
istic emotion. It is a hurtful production, and while
witnessing it one feels like reading La Rochefou-
cauld in a laSar-hoilse, or Ouida’s “Moths ’ ih *
small-pox hospital. Nearly everybody in the
drama is a miserably heartless scoundrel 'tad
whoever is not, is a pronounced fool. The plot j,
stuffed With improbabilities, and the characters
seem to have been borrowed from the “Beggars’
Opera, taught “ manners,” clothed in fashionable
raiment, and accommodated with all the gilded
fixings of latter-day corruption, including un-
limited Havanas, brandy-and-sodas, Monte Carlo
banks, gambling clubs, and refined idleness—only
the dialogue is far too smart to be representative
of the genuine Savernakes of modern high-claas
scoundrelism. The story is the thin and thread
bare romance of the woman who is clever enough tn
tool all men to the verge of a Deeming
yet not clever enough to fool ohe sufficiently
until up to a late hour—to undertake a safely
commonplace matrimonial contract; After all the
siren of ineffable ability cannot effectually sire’hiza

Hive plbt of “As iii a Looking Glass ” lids
already been flilly described in, a former isstie ol
Ihe Bulletin; heiice we shall losb tib time in
getting at the essentials of Saturday night’s pro-
duction. Mrs. Bernard Beere’s entrance in the
first act was the signal for an outburst of joyous
applause, which intimated, as plainly as hands
could do, that the audience was prepared to be
pleased at any price—and it was ! The English
Bernhardt, as her crassly indiscriininating country-
men ca 1 her, looked worn and tired, but she was
admirably costumed, and her smile was as artistic as
her dresses. She cannot help that, however fob
she is an artist, from the cboWh of her head to the
sole of her foot—but she is hot Bata, ahd if all
accounts are correct, neither is she the Beebe bf
other days. She van act! When she warms tb
her work she can electrify her andiehcfe—but she
often seems too weary to do it, and she is doubt-
less conscious that her audience Would hardly
appreciate the effort if she made it. Her great
sc *™r th the / ? rowd is the one in the third act
with the young Scotch prig Whbrti she is afixiota
to annex connubially ; but for quiet; fbhiihifae
point-making, the scene with Miss Watson Hi
winch she essays to break off that young lady’s
engagement, is, in oub opinion, the gem of her
performance. The death-agony, however, is
somewhat Tom-Tayloresqne, and reminds one
unpleasanUy of the dying Jester in the
Fool s Revenge.” Miss Watson is a natural
and pleasant little maiden of thb sbffc and Stffi-
channe variety, too good for this life, and too
pretty to leave it; while Miss Urquhart disappears
Horn the scene of action at too early a date, and
just as> most; ofthe audience are beginning to loth
her. Mrs, Griffiths’ Lady Gage is adequate—and
little more. Ihe good young mail of the piece is
Mr. Stuart, of immaculate personal appearanbfi
and faultless tailoring; but much tdb lovely Ibr any
place outside a three-volume novel by a lady
authoress, Mr. Stauhtoh, a soil, by the Way, of
n U S ta ed itably as Captain Fair-
field, and Mr. England’s Sir Thomas is crude and
il -digested. However, this latter part is so
thanklessly stupid that probably no self-respecting
actor could do anything better with it
than he does. ihe real, beautiful, and “fat”
character in the show is Hromiroff, a com-
bination of Max O’Rell and HawkshaW t!is
detective, played in a deliriously semi-droll, semi-
senous fashion pf mock-hetoicism by M. Marins
whose quaint accent is one of the chief seductions
of this present typeof drawing-room mirror. The
magnificent, blustering, cynical nineteenth-century
bravo and black-mailer, card-sharper and swash-
buckler, Captain Fortinbras, upheld with a full
hand of trumps by Mr. Herbert Standing, lends
a lot of unwholesome reality to tiie hysterics of
several of the other performers, and his villainy is
so materialistically reasonable that the drama is
practically held together by the sheer force of con-
solidated wickedness represented by about 14-stone
of well-dressed virility. The occasion of Mrs.
Bernard Beere s appearance on Saturday last was
seized upon by the management for the “ im-
veding of a new drop, exquisitely painted bv
Mr. George Gordon. It represents the Rialto, or
the church of St. Mark’s, or San something, in
the antique city of Venice ; and, as Australians,
we are sorry that Mr. Gordon was obliged to go
so tar afield for a subject.

Like the ancient Cleopatra, age cannot wither

more humour m his bob - wig than in a

the signal for a howl of joy from a crowded
bouse, and he fairly shared with Miss Billoe
Barlow all the honours of the show. “Jack’s”
red wig is still a signal for an uproarious whoop
from her friends in the gallery, and she Ta-ra-ra-
boom-de-ayses with a glee and a vigour unworthily
rewarded by a cool retreat within old Newgate’s
walls. Mr. Royce is engaged for the present week
only, and all those anxious to revive the sweet
delicious memory of the past had better take the
hint and make the most of fleeting time. “ Little

At the Criterion, Sydney, “ Diplomacy
arrived at finality for a season on Monday last.
Messrs. Brough and Boucicault are advertising
!, e expiration of their lease of this theatre on
Tune the 17th, hence their present season will last
only three weeks longer, and they are consequently
anxious to hurry on as many pieces as they
nossibly can produce within that time. On
Tuesday, Wycherley’s fine old English comedy
of the “Country Girl” was put on the
stiee with entirely new fixings, and with
111 ’following strong cast; Moody was
ulived by Mr. Lawrence; Belleville, by Mr.
Boucicault; Harcourt, by Mr. A. E. Greenaway;
Snarkish, by Mr. Percy Lyndal; William, by
Mr. Hards; Lucy, by Miss Emma Temple;
Ahithea, by Mrs. Molyneax, and Peggy, the
country girl, by Miss Pattie Browne —with results
?lending notice next week. Boucicault’s one-act
clay of “ My Little Girl ” preceded Wycherley’s
comedy as a lever de rideaux, in which Messrs.
Titheradge, Lash Gordon and Boucicault, and
Misses Romer and Temple took part.

The Harry Rickards English Comedy
Company presented a new bill on Saturday night
at the Garrick Theatre, including a farcical comedy
entitled “ In a Fog,” comic and sentimental songs,
recitations and violin solos ; but the best thing in
the bill was Harry Rickards’dramatic coster sketch
of the “ Old Kent Road.” On the 4th of June, the
Shakespearean tragedian Walter Bentley, who
has just arrived from Maoriland after a highly
successful tour, will open at this theatre with a
presentation of the melancholy Dane by the
immortal Baconspeare.

the Alhambra, and other places of amusement
continue to barter door-checks for coin of the

The Gaiety burlesque, “Faust Up to
Date,” is evidently tending to amuse at Mel-
bourne Opera House. The tardy arrival of Marion
Hood upon the scene gives a little more tone to
the entertainment, and raises it a few feet nearer
to the height of expectation. Yet, a sense of
something wanting haunts the crowded audito-
rium, and the grand old faith in Gaiety companies
begins to crumble. “Faust Up to Date ’is a
rather clever travestie of Goethe’s story, inter-
rupted towards the finish by irrelevant variety
items. As a foundation for the performers to
work upon, the “ book” is probably stronger than
the literary portion of, say, “ Cinder Ellen,' but
the workers don’t seem to understand the art of
burlesque-building in all its branches. Lonnen,
the primeval Nickoderaus of the piece, is not
instinctively grotesque or gratuitously absurd.
He has no fund of bye-play to draw upon,
and his best efforts go for less than they are
really worth, on account of a certain serious-
ness that rings in his mellow notes and
controls the fury of his nimble legs. It is not until
he gets into a coster garb, with the trousers cut
saucy 99 over his cloven trotters, that this Devil
fairly fills the stage, and the world begins to weary
of coster ditties, anyway. Marion Hood warbles
with less power than of yore, but is otherwise the
dainty, pleasant, uneventful young creature she
has ever been. Miss Addie Conyers, now seen as
Faust, is also a graceful visitor, who walks through
her part intelligently, and a Mr. Courtneidge,
having a good deal to do in the funny line, does it
with more regularity than dispatch. Mr. Haslem,
reputed to be a capable vocalist when called upon,
puts in a brief appearance without vocalising.
Miss Lethbridge is the long-skirt dancer of the
Company, and dances very nicely in a style that
has lost the charm of novelty. Long-skirt dancers
who spend most of their time in dusting the
floor with a handkerchief, fan, bouquet,
or whatnot, are becoming almost mono-
tonous as the coster. Other features of ‘ E aust up
to Date ” are a tiny active damsel, Miss Katie
Barry, and a solid, broad comedienne. Miss Maria
Jones, both of whom are useful in their respective
spheres. Furthermore there is a tall flower (name
unknown) of pure Gaiety growth. She toils not
and doesn’t look like spinning, but she has come
all the way from dear old England, by jove . to
enliven the proceedings with a classic simper. It
is generally reported that this article of stage
furniture is a lovely girl. Finally there is A.ice
Leamar who being an experienced music-hall
artist with a lingering smile has easily boom del-
ay’d herself into favor. For Alice is rorty and
has plenty of go, and in the kingdom of the tame
the wild' demonstrative angel takes the chair.
The burlesque is liberally chorussed and assisted
by the management, but the principals don t
change their dresses five or six times in one act.

“ A Sailor’s Knot,” which modern drama
of olden times was recently a matter for con-
sideration in Sydney, brought the odour of brine
from the ocean and the flavour of Thames mud,
not forgetting the pomp and circumstance of war,
into the Melbourne "Royal, on Saturday night.
It confirmed the excellent idea that the British
seaman is a splendid fellow, likewise, it deepened
the glorious conviction that the 1 rent h a .y.
retreat before the wag of the Lion s tail. A more
patriotic yarn never emanated from the sea-girt
isle of our ancestors, so, if the local
don’t part five shillings a head cheerfully for the
privilege of hearing Buonaparte wiped out in the
distance, they ought to be yoked together with
them there silken bonds and dragged up tQ-Je
pay-box. The last act of “A Sailors Knot
where the comraander-in-chief, or somebody,
comes puffing up to the rescue with a reprieve or
an able-bodied seaman, and blows his martial nose
whilst the jolly tar hugs his Liza, is rather a
tough morsel, but the mounting of this army and
navy spectacle, from the start at Wappmg Old
Stairs to the finish on the Road to Paris, should
ensure success. Moreover, the company form a
mass meeting of melodramatic talent,
suitable to the period, and Mr. Charles'
is one of the most humanly natura! and capable
heroes that ever dragged a monster of iniquity to
a fit and proper doom.
At the Alexandra they had another slap
at the Immortal Bard on Friday, when At ho -
wood, a soulful young actor who wears his head a
trifle on the bias, went Romeomg after Juliet Lily
Dampier to the complete satisfaction of a well-
filled house. “ Romeo and Juliet seems to be a
popular tragedy with the unmarried public, ana
the brief honeymoon act (which is a beautiful
instance of the classic drama detying a modern
Lord Chamberlain) is invariably played to the
soft accompaniment of maidens’ sighs, teliakes-
peare, one regrets to notice, is gradually unlit mg
the Aleck, company for ordinary domestic duties.
They don’t seem to give their minds to Lea
Beat,” or else it is that they are all trying
to act the name part at once. Anyway, they
drag their weary lengths along as though
life were a funeral with _ Lily Dampier as
chief mourner. Miss Lily is very perfunctory
and tired. She occasionally pulls herself together
and laughs in the wrong place, but her snic> o
omission are many. Lily snatches a revolver
from the villain and “ pots ’’ her lover in the eye
by mistake without troubling to conceal her
ennui. At the crisis of her career she seems in
imminent danger of dozing off. These _ remarks
have an all-round significance and are issued by
way of warning to several other people who yv ill
have another chance to redeem their characters
next Saturday, when “Devil’s Luck comes on
for discussion.
* * * *
“ Gloriana,” fired off for the first time, at
Melbourne Bijou, on Saturday, is a farcical
Parisian comedy spoilt by the heavy hand of the
adaptor. Complications arise in a consistently
impossible manner, and the number of rooms
where people would be lost if they were discovered
is moderate in the extreme. It is possible to cast
a cold cynical eye at this dramatic performance
without detecting a hoary heavy father m the act
of climbing into the coal scuttle, or hiding his
diminished head under the sofa. It reeks with
misunderstandings, but is completely innocent of
a mother-in-law, or maiden aunt. It is also inno-
cent of anything approaching a fixed purpose, and
leaves a good deal of wickedness to the imagina-
tion. Gloriana is a female, not too bad and not
too good. In her English dress Gloriana is a
widow who only carries on up to a certain point
and persuades her audience that she isn t as giddy
as she ought to have been in order to make her-
self quite intelligible. Mrs. Brough interprets this
translation from the original with strict regard tor
Mrs. Grundy, whilst Sass, disguised in a dome-
like bald head, scores heavily as a Russian diplo-
matist of weak intellect. He has just enough
brains to suspect his Gloriana, and so he arms him-
self with a drawn sword, and howls for the blood
of the wrong man, until the right man explains
that there never was any such person. Gann am
is generally on the verge of being put to death by
the Czar’s faithful lunatic, but Cecil Ward, the
real object of suspicion, sticks the tail of a
Spanish rooster in his cocked-hat and eventually
marries Brenda Gibson. They had loved one
another from the first, and the hat settled it.
Brough appears again as a fond parent with grey
whiskers, and the other members of a select cast
divide the scrag-end of the agony amongst them.

Italian Opera in general and Signora
Cuttica in particular are now meeting with the
appreciation that rewards all high art sooner or
later, unless something happens to prevent, i re
state of the Princess’s on the fourth night of
“Lucia” denoted that a portion of the populace
hadn’t been able to find room, and thoenthusiasm
of all who got inside was a noise to remember.
Nothing save a possible disturbance m the deli-
cate bronchial tubes of husband- Cuttica can
arrest a triumphal progress of the Italians
through their short series of operas. La
Traviata” was given on Saturday and Tuesday.
To-night (Thurday) they go to “ ihe Barber and
on Saturday there will be an expensive produc-
tion of the “ Faust ” that is immortal, and not up
to any particular date.
* * * *
‘•Jo” has been filling up the iniswf-
operatic nights at the Princess’s with large attend-
ances, large enough to inspire the hope that Jennie
Lee will not shoulder her broom and scoot on
Friday night but “ Jo ” it for a week longer, in
all important respects “ Jennie’s ” prize creation is
the same stroke of genius that made her fame re-
sound through several continents several years ago
—a pause for breath comes in after that. Once m
a way she plays poor jokes with the lad to tickle
up the groundlings and make the more thinking
(that’s us) grieve, because her art is stiff true to
Poll. All the rest of the time she hits off the idea
of the author to a smudge. Her support is tolerably
strong, too. George Melville makes a good greasy
Chad band, George Leitcli is a first-class husband
of the shrill female who cooks muffins for the
apostle, and young Cosgrove is a creditable
T ulkinghorn, notwithstanding that he blacks half
of Ids face to look like a piebald Christy minstrel
and then attempts a faint imitation of Irving.
Burnett is aggressively natural and familiar as
Inspector Buckett, and of the otheis Lady
Deblock has at least a haughty sneer to offer in
extenuation of her offence.

Max O’Rell, at the Athena;urn, is educating
some people up to facts they didn’t know before,
and satisfying others that old yarns are well
worth hearing again from a I reach raconteur who
understands his business and has discovered the
secret of making a little “ accent leaven a whole
lump of lecture. In the little list of circumstances
that account for M. Blouet’s success on the plat-
form surely the turn of Ins tongue is pre-eminen .
Foli opens at the Town Hall on Saturday, mid a
number of other shows haven t been shut during
the mst week. They are especially open to
improvement, although, by the way, the horses at
Fitzgerald’s Circus have already learned as mud
as can be expected.

From Melbourne Herald notice of “Faust
Up to Date ”
„d ,mprec,d tl Md dot-ree so “W exodlmM. 1 “Jo
SS B indramatic history and who certainly has no
veer amongst the players oj the day.
More by way of providing the poor Melbourne
public with plaster for their sick stomachs than
from a desire to give “ dramatic history its fan
dinkum, The Bulletin will describe Mr. Lonuen
as a cultivated singer and expert dancer, in whose
singing and dancing there is no original humour,
a nd very little that excites merriment, anyhow.
He has no bye-play worth mentioning, and is
entirely wanting in that fertility of fooling
capacity for “ gag,” and inventive nonsense which
enabled Fred Leslie to carry a modern burlesque
scene through. Mr. Lonnen doesn’t fill the stage,
is not vivacious, as the word is understood in the
burlesque business, and his comedy is so ‘legiti-
mate” and “well controlled” as to seem un-
questionably slow and heavy to people who don t
want quiet naturalism in a leg-show. In a word,
The Bulletin says that daily newspaper criticism
is arrant rot, and appeals to the electors on this
particular issue.

Surrounded by wet and depressing circum-
stances, Williamson’s Comic Opera Co. opened at
Brisbane Opera House on Saturday night in Ihe
Gondoliers.” Charlie Taylor, after upending
melodrama for many months at the Gaiety, con-
templates a Northern tour. The Queensport
Aquarium and Menagerie manages to draw a
riotous assembly of five or six every Sunday on
the strength of advertising an attraction in the
shape of a cheetah—the only living specimen of
which species was hitherto supposed to be in the
possession of the proprietors of Brisbane lele-
GRAPH.
At Poverty Point.
Visitors rush now to Deeming s Windsor vuiia and pay
sixpence a head to look at the hearthstone ' They h
relics also, and one rejoices over a brick, with adhering
hair. He paid a shilling for it, and uses it as a chimney-
ornament. Waxworks in your own house, neat, but not
too gory. .
Garner has an eye to Melbourne Royal. The proprietors
are sorry they didn’t take his liberal offer before the
Coppiu fiasco was entered upon, but now Garner can take
a high hand, and unless Bland Holt dives in, theii s a
likelihood of seeing the Triumvirate, Williamson, Garner,
Musgrove, in a triangular duel.
Kyrle Bellew’s hair is fast turning grey. Many critics
declare that it is the horror of seems Mrs. Biown-Potter
act five nights every week that is doing it.
No sooner did Lonnen appear, at the Melbourne Opera
House, than identities discerned his close resemblance to
J, L. Hall, who made such a hit as the travesty Mephis-
topheles. Intrinsically we dare say Hall was as good as
Lonnen, but everything lies in your chances. Hall s
Mephisto. was singularly whimsical.
If Mrs. Bancroft returns to the stage to play old
women,” so much the better for the stage Long ago in
Gilbert’s “ Sweethearts,” she gave a beautiful sketch of a
silver-haired spinster, who had remained faithful to her
young love during the 30 years that elapsed between the
first and second acts. The young love turned up at fcst
a polite, wealthy bachelor rum, and, taking it foi giantea
that his sweetheart had got married, enquired any
fara-i-lee?” Whereupon the constant mash knocked
her old beau silly by producing a little casket contamin
the dead fragments of the rose he gave her in the first
act. Then he felt sorry for having forgotten that gnls
are so loyal and true (in plays), and they walked off m the
late autumn of their lives to get married, aftei all. Mis.
Bancroft, as the mother of Captain Swift, would be woith
seeing
Little Luscomhe Searelle, who appears to boss the
whole of the theatres in South Africa, threatened Kyrle

Johannesburg fire. Kyrle and Cora, howei ei, departed
for England, hence nothing came of the proceedings.
Luscomhe and his wife once tried the actmn for dama es

was so hideously unsatisfactory that the composer
will probably hesitate ere seeking to gain shekels in that
way again. .

Bulletin, -Nearly all the papers credit Deeming
with being the first person to introduce the heaiHistone
secreting business to Australia. This is a mistake. J. L.
Williamson can fairly claim to be the local P loa ecr in l is

awav to 1 fight for his bleeding country, he puts his faun
deeds beneath the hearthstone, and I shouidn t be greatly
surprised if Deeming got his first ideas of ris ut'litj fro ii

Last Saturday there died in Sydney Hospital, alone and
quite forgotten, that favourite Australian actress, Miss
Mao-o-ie Oliver. She was born in Sydney, in 1848, and foi
many years was beloved of Australian audiences in
general and reverenced by the pit in particular. But at
last— some four years ago-she dropped out of sight, and
then her admirers speedily forgot that she had e>ei
existed. She died of dropsy, and had an unpretentious
funeral, and left no assets behind her.

Henry Irving, in his evidence before the Lords Select
Committee on places of amusement, stated that some
years ago he contemplated producing a play founded on
the romantic story of Robert Emmett, the Irish patriot,
hut he received a hint from the Lord Chamberlain that
the play would not be permitted as it touched on a poli-
tical subject. Gladstone was then in power and the
Irish question was just coming to the front, hence the

In its issue of March 19. The Bulletin. published a

whom it obviously meant to do a p?d turn ~3 "h

was based upon altogether erroneous information, and it
has to express its regret that such a mistake should
have been made. The individual referred to was not
arrested either upon an accusation of vagrancy or upon

Sio-norina Guldotti’s mother accompanied her to Aus-

There is in Melbourne a woman tattooed all over. An
Irish-American couple, a young man and woman, both
wonderfully tattooed, have been making a fortune by
exhibiting through Europe. Though Anglo- Saxon
audiences won’t stand the lady’s chest, back, and legs,
all so copiously decorated, the tattooing is accepted by
Continental audiences in place of clothing.
Cabled that Geraldine Ulmar has recovered £lOOO
damages, from New York Herald, for writing that she
was about to obtain a divorce from her husband, tenor
Ivan Caryll. Rather raw, considering they were only-

Plain Bill Holloway’s judgment is vindicated by the
succession of plays bought by Brough and Boucicault
from him.
Rumoured that George Leitch is going to join William-
son’s company and take some of the parts once filled by

will notice the odour and take him for ahold, bad, hard-

A claimant, alleged to be a son of deceased,
has sprung up to demand a portion of the estate
of the late millionaire Thomas Walker, of Con-

It is reported that Deeming has left his

Marshall Lyle may fee delighted and flat-

A very rich Sydney man who died not so

One Watson, in a London periodical,
lately wrote on Tennyson’s “wintry” hair.
Tennyson wrote him that there never was a grey

“ Was it a business or a friendly trans-
action?” asked the lawyer of Joe Clarke in the

Macdonald Cameron, the British mining-
expert, who was out here lately and has since been
travelling in Borneo, says that a cannibal Dyak
told him that the tit-bits of the human body were

over ex-Governor Carington !
Miller (Jennie Opio’s husband, once re-
moved), the self-constituted ‘‘Lord Leamington,”
now doing a year for bigamy, was formerly
Sunday school superintendent and leader of a

iniquity our prisons would be !
A Northern bishop who “ follows Christ
in a carriage ” drawn by two splendid, coal-black

Fred. Blackham, the retired printer’s
overseer of the Age, died the other day at
Brighton, Melb., where he had a news-agency.
He will go down to posterity as the father of
•Tack McCarthy Blackham, the wicket-keeper of
the century; and as the most inexorable “early
copy” man ever met in a printing-office.
There is a fatality about these scriptural
names. Matthias Spruhen, ahoy, was convicted
of stabbing a mate, at Albury, N.S.W., the other
day. The way the Solomons, Obadiahs, Ebcnezers,
Jonathans, Zachariahs, and Jeremiahs turn up in
the Criminal Courts is most extraordinary, and
suggests a new scientific study: “Nomenclature
and its psychological influence.”
Edward Butler, to his dying day, vowed
that it was entirely owing to Gavan Duffy's in-
discretion (Bnt’er used a stronger term) that the
secrets of the Young Ireland party became known
to the Government in '4B. All preparations were
made for a rising, hut, as usual, there was a traitor
(or a gas-bag) in the camp. History taught
Parnell a lesson, and he trusted nobody.
Once whilst a member of the debased
'Victorian Opposition was walking upon Bent’s
tender sensibilities with hobnailed boots, Mr. B.
rose in his place in a volcanic state, and erupted
to the following effect : “ Sir ” (splutter, splutter),
‘ would you like to know what Mrs. Bent thinks
of you? Mrs. Bent thinks you’re a crawler!”
The House signified its feeling in the usual
manner.
Sir Charles Burdett, Baronet, cousin of
Lady Burdett-Coutts, died last week in the

for many years a gum-digger and had lately
developed into a vagrant —in fact, had been many
times sent to gaol “on the vag.” The heir to the
baronetcy is his son, a lad of 12, who will no

Ihe Bulletin’s London correspondent: —
Lord Kilinorey, who is pretty well up in Court-
gossip owing to his intimacy with the Duke of
Edinburgh, on whose staff he served in Australia
when Lord Newry, assures me that it is quite
arranged that Prince George is to marry Princess
May, Ids late brother’s fiancee. The announce-
meat will not long be delayed. Lord Kilinorey,
who owns the St. James Theatre, is still as devoted
as ever to stage life.
Mahal Besanfc, daughter of Bradlaugh’s
fair disciple, is going to be married in the old,
ordinary way. Mabel is chiefly interesting as a
reminder of how the world moves forward. Years
ago the dunderheaded magnates of British law
decided that Mrs. 8., with her advanced notions,
wasn’t a fit person to have charge of her own
child, just as the legislators of that period con-
sidered Bradlaugh altogether too shocking for the
House of Commons.
J. F. Nisbet, the author of that clever
book, “The Insanity of Genius,” writes the
greater part of “Our Handbook” in London
Referee. which is now a great feature of that
paper. Nisbet is a medical man by profession,
but he has given up tint sawbones business for
journalism and literature, like Conan Doyle, C. J.
Willis, and others, though Doyle, by the way,
still does some kind of practice. A great many of
the best English litterateurs belong to the same
profession.
New York Independent has a terrific
onslaught on the late Walt Whitman as a poet :
“It was impossible that the pure taste of a decent
people could long endure the foul, or find peren-
nial enjoyment in a loud auctioneer’s catalogue of
members, regions, and activities. He outlived
his fame, and will never recover Ir's reputation ;
because he had in him no music, no imagination,
no delicacy of sentiment, and was but the voice of
one bawling in the wilderness, with nothing to
say to the listener.”
Alexander Britton, who is “doing” the
historical records of N.S.W., is a son of one of the
oldest Victorian journalists, Alexander Britton,
who carried on at Castlemaino in tins fifties and
early sixties a vigorous paper called the Miner’s

youths, were considered marvels in stenography a t

Life in a Pig-stv.- Lord Deerhurst’s antipathy-to eoan
and water is generally known. One night, during the
time that Sophia Debouchette (afterwards Lady Berwick!
was living under his protection, his Lordship being rather
“ Baoohi plenus,” was extolling the charms and manners
of his mistress to the Club at Whiles’, and concluded his
eulogy with the following trope—"ln fact, I live only in
Sophia’s eyes.” “ I don’t doubt it,” said Lord Alvanlev
“ for I observed she had a sty in them the last time I saw
her.”
When John O’Shanassy was a candidate
for Yilliers and Heytcsbury (Vic.) many years
ago, Gavan Duffy, then in the hey-day of his
popularity, volunteered to canvass the electorate
for him. Ho opened the campaign by calliim
upon a well-known identity, one O’Brien, a inanof
considerable influence amongst the Irish electors
O’Brien had one special ambition, and that one
was to be made a J.P. Knowing this weakness
Duffy said to him one day in the most innocent
manner possible : “ Ob, by the way, Mr. O’Brien
I want to make a declaration, and I shall ho
obliged if you, as a magistrate, will be good
enough to witness it.” The old man took the
bait and replied ; “ Sure I'm no magistrate
though, for the matthor o’ that, it was promised
me long ago.’ “ You not a magistrate,” said the
cunning Duffy, with well-affected surprise, “ You
one of the most influential men in this important
district, not a magistrate? There is surely some
unpardonable mistake about tin’s. I must see
about it the moment I get back to Melbourne.”
O Brien’s heart was won at once, and he became
O’Shanassy’s most fervent supporter. But, alas
for human ingratitude, poor O’Brien’s name never
appeared in the Gazette, and, speaking to a
friend a long while after of Duffy’s perfidy, the
old chap said : “Would ye bleeve it, I never seen
nor herrd of the squakin’ schamer from that day
to this.” “ Squakin’ schamer ”is good.
The latest story of the Austrian Crown
Prince’s violent death is that there was a supper
party (four men and four ladies) at the royal hunt-
ing lodge, and when Rudolph had become suf-
ficiently drunk he called upon the company to
pose in early Eden costume. Three of the ladies
began to shed their toilettes and get ready for a
loyal blush, but the other one, wno considered
herself the Prince’s “own pertik.,” tried to leave
the room. Such a display of modesty in court
circles exasperated the Heir Apparent. He shot
the girl dead, sobered up suddenly, and put a
second bullet through his own wretched brain.
Whereupon tiie surviving ladies and gentlemen
returned to their clothes as quickly as possible
and swore themselves to secrecy. Recently they
have been getting drunk again, especially the
female portion of the syndicate, and the ghastly
narrative is hiccupped forth.
The cabled death of the fourth Earl of
Leitrim recalls to mind the murder of his wicked
old predecessor, 14 years ago. Home Rule hadn’t
come within the range of “respectable” politics
at that time, and Leitrim’s vile corpse was pro-
fusely slobbered over by the English press. Fora
week or two the dear dead Earl did duty as the
typical benevolent landlord who had fallen a
victim to Fenianism, and it was broadly hinted
that the blood of the noble martyr cried out for
vengeance upon Parnell and the Irish Party.
Presently it became known that Leitrim’s long
immunity from bullets was owing solely to the
fact that he had practised his enormities (whole-
sale seductions) in a country where landlords were
under the immediate protection of soldiers and
police. The military were even called out to sup-
press the mob that had fully intended to drag the
hoary villain from his coffin and stick his heart
on a skewer.

Cements, —Dear sir, —For fully five years I have
been a great sufferer from general debility, weak-
ness and extreme nervousness. My nerves were
completely unstrung, and they felt to bo con-
tinually in motion. I had sometimes complete
loss of the power of moving the limbs, and restless
and sleepless nights and complete loss of appetite.
These troubles all arose from the effects of typhoid,
which I had five years ago, since which time I
have never been able to stand the slightest exertion
without complete physical collapse. I consulted
several physicians, who said I was suffering from
general debility. They prescribed various medi-
cines during the three years I was under their
hands, but I derived no benefit whatever. I
heard of the effects of Clements Tonic, and gave
it a trial, and when only taking the second bottle
I found great benefit, and now, after taking six or
seven bottle 3, my health appears quite restored.
1 have a good appetite, can eat anything, and can
do any reasonable amount of work without feeling
the strain, whereas at one time I could do none at
all. I have recommended Clements Tonic to
many people, all of whom benefited by its use and
all speak of it in the highest of praise.—Yours
faithfully, G. Swan.

When you are suffering from indigestion no good
can result from taking tonics or stimulants, which
create a false appetite and conduce to an overload-
ing of the stomach at a time when the digestive
organs are incapable of performing their proper
functions. If a stimulant is fancied the desire can
be effectually, but only temporarily, satisfied by
taking a teaspoonful of brandy diluted with water,
but if a permanent cure for indigestion is desired
take Boot’s Indigestion Cure, which is not a “cure
all ” —claiming to be a specific for every epidemic
that arises—but is an absolute cure for Indigestion
only. .

POLITICAL POINTS
Balfour is evidently the B. R. Wise of
English politics.
The actual reduction in train mileage in
Victoria is 550,000.
Schnadhorst (the British Liberal organiser)
promises Gladstone a majority of 140 after the
general election.
There is disunion amongst the Playford
Ministry. However matters may stand, Kingston
will soon be Premier.
Strange, though the election was by ballot»
no member of the Labour party was chosen on
X.S.W. Parliamentary Public Works Committee.
Miss Catherine Spence, the Adelaide
advocate of Hare’s ballot system, says she believes
this is her mission, and the lady won’t rest till
the idea becomes law.
Now they say that John Gavan Duffy gave
np the Victorian Attorney-Generalship with only
a shady prospect of the Speakership, but the cer-
tainty of a Judgeship.
It seems certain that directly S.A. Parlia-
ment meets on June 9 there will be a fierce
assault on the Treasury bench. Quidnuncs give
the numbers as about even.
It is stated that a very prominent Queens-
land politician has a big transcontinental land-
cnab railway-scheme rigged up in anticipation of
he passing of the land-grant Parliamentary job.
This is what Kanaka recruiting means.
The recruiters arrange with the tribal chief to
supply SO many “boys” for so much “trade.”
And between the devil and the deep blue sea the
Kanaka’s choice is Hobson's.
How is it the Jews are persecuted, when
they are so amazingly loyal everywhere ? Look,
for example, at Isaacs’ maiden speech in the Vic-
torian Assembly. Isaacs, by the way, promises to
become the southern Salomons.
The fact of Victorian brandy having taken
firm hold on the European market, casts an addi-
tional damper on the prohibitionist cause, in that
it supplies another strong commercial reason for
not tearing up the Australian vineyards.
Melbourne Mint, which has hitherto only
coined gold, is now to coin silver. The coinage of
gold means a heavy loss, but the British Govern-
ment has been making a colossal profit out of its
silver coin from the fall in silver values.
Bartlett, the eccentric spirit of the S A.
Parliament, was lately told that lie would be
“considered” in the event of bis vote help ng to
turn the reigning Ministry out. “ Oh, damn your
considerations,” replied Bartlett, “ I’ve been had
that way before. But it in writing.”
In many English agricultural districts the
average rent is 2s. 6d. an acre, and the tithe —the
amount taken for the support of the bloated
Episcopal Church—is 7s. Gd. per acre. The land-
lord is rapacious enough, but he isn’t a patch on
the meek and lowly toiler in the vineyard.
Sir Bryan O’Loghlan is to move the Aric-
torian Parliament to reinstate the name of Christ
in the State school-books. The Pope, by any
other name, would sound as sweet. Christ
would certainly be an improvement on Richard
Coeur de Lion, Henry VIII. and William of
Orange.
Six years ago, 11 members of A ictoria s
Parliament out of 13 were defeated at the general
election through having signed the now historical
“Grattan Address.” Since then, they have nearly
all been re-elected, and this Parliament includes
a lineal descendant —the member for Luroa and
Shepparton—of Grattan himself.
When “ blackbirding ”is once more in
full swing in the slave state we shall see some
very blue-blooded labour-agents shipped to see
that the “ reggdlashuns is carried out.” There is
more in this black-labour business than meets
the eye—billets must be found for the scions of
the bullock-mouthed aristocracy.
Lord Carington advises the Imperial
Government not to meddle with the Queensland
Kanaka question. If the Imperial Government
does i ot it will be a confession that it can never
meddle with any Australian question whatsoever.
Mathless, Carington’s advice to let Australia
settle her own quarrels is “ downy.”
Sir Bryan O’Loghlen, the wild, bald
baronet of Victoria, has a remedy for depression ;
“The mileage of the railways should be doubled
as soon as possible. We should borrow £20,000,000
to do it, and spend <£3,000,000 to =£4,000,000 a
year. If the Government would grasp the situa-
tion in this way prosperity would be restored.”
“ British Frcetrade, Bright’s Frcetrado,
is the most intense nonsense that ever provoked
human patience. The people of Australia are
quite right to protect their industries and teach
their young men trades in complete disregard of
parliamentary palaver. No nation ever got manu-
factures in any other way.” —Thomas Carlyle.
A Melbourne interviewer lias been asking
ancwM.P. how it all feels. The best item is a
discussion re the Parliamentary salary. Neither
the reporter nor the M.P. knew how it was paid,
and agreed that it was infra dig, for a new member
to go to a boy behind the Treasury counter, and
say “I’m Mister Blank, M.L.A. for , come
for my money.”
The N.S.W'. “ National ” Association’s
“ purification-of-the-rolls ” operations has resulted
in the most laughable fiasco on record. When
brought to bay, the Association dared do nothing,
for fear of incurring court costs. Its sole basis of
operations was its knowledge that the workman
whoso vote was challenged couldn’t afford to take
a holiday, hire a lawyer, and haggle the matter
out in court.
Madame de Stael wrote that no revolution
ever succeeded without the co-operation of some
of the upper classes. Rosebery exemplifies
with the fierce Radicalism he is developing. But
trot out Rosebery-pierre again, with “ You can t
be the friend of the people and live in a palace,”
which, being interpreted, means “ The bell-topper
is part of the uniform of the bogus National Asso-
ciation.”
Deakin’s attack on the Victorian “ inter-
regnum ” Ministry, in which be stated that Shiels
“ came to a reckoning ” with the Age before dis-

plainly suggested that the Age’s classification o
members was a mere suiting of the word to the libel"

whole cake, for parliamentary plain speaking.
Perhaps the most locally exciting contest
at the late Victorian elections was that for
Anglesey, where M. K. McKenzie wrested the
seat by seven votes from P. who had
reigned supreme for 18 years. McKenzie, although
a grazier and “dual vote” man, secured the
shearers’ vote in the electorate on account of his
kindness and generosity to them at the shearing.
Though handicapped by his blindness, his oratory
carried him tlnough.
Tom Playford’s truthful but undiplomatic
statement to the Townsville reporter that the
Kanaka labour system was equivalent to slavery,
will probably wreck bis shaky Ministry. Ibis is
the second time Tom has put his foot in it. When
John Colton was S. A. Premier, Playford wrecked
the concern by bis treatment of Thow, now
employed under the N.S.W. Government, loin
had even to seek a country electorate owing to the
hubbub ra’se.d by bis own constituents.
Gambling in Kanakas lias always been a
common thing. A hundred speculators put in
tenner each to equip and despatch a “ black-
birder : to the South Sea:;. An interest is offered
to the Government agent gratis, and the captain
and crew are allotted shares. These ventures pay
goi d dividends, as a rule. The larger the cargo
the larger the dividend ; and the buccaneering
crew don't let the sea-grass grow on their keels,
either.
The Bulletin suggests that Kanakiigriff
should institute a Kanaka saleyard in connection
with “the stringent regulations.” The weekly report
would read like this : “ 140 Kanakas, ex Hopeful,
yarded at Enoggera to-day. One lot in particular
were very prime and realised advanced prices.
Best Solomon Islanders topped the market,
realising from A3O to 1-40 per head for the term.
Strong Erromangas fetched from A 25 to =£3o,
weak ditto up to =£ls per head. There is a con-
tinued steadiness in “gins,” and young Tannas
found favour at .£3O per head. Kangaroo skins
firm.” Why not?
Max O’Rell, in bis John Bull lecture, says
that a visitor to a new country generally goes to
the wrong place for information. Now the O It.
has been taken in hand by Government House in
two provinces, and by the Austral Salon in Mel-
bourne, wherefore his book on Australia will
assuredly contain abundance of “ informations.
Dear Bulletin, —Many years ago Dailey,
Edward Butler, Pat. Higgins, and one or two
other more or less devout and practical Holy
Romans—alas, the writer is the only survivor of
the merry party —were going from the \\ eathei-
board, N.S.W. (then the railway terminus) to
Bathurst. It was coldish weather in April, and
when Tom Symonds, prince of coachmen, halted
Ids smoking team at Mrs. Lee’s hostelry, at
Wallerawang. everybody was ready to do justice to
the splendid dinner. Dailey at once, more su< ,
placed himself in front of a 251 b. turkey and pro-
ceeded to carve. Pat. Higgins alone refused to
partake of the bird, saying he would wait. “ Take
a little to go on with, old man,” said W.B.D.
“No, thank you, my friend,” said Pat with a
smile (for he had his joke up his sleeve) “ it's Good
Friday, and I am waiting for a tin of salmon.”
Down went the knives and forks as if they were
red hot. “Never mind,” said Dailey, always
equal to anv occasion, “ I'll see what can be done
without risking the anathemas of the Church.”
He disappeared for a few minutes and presently
came back escorting a huge pot of potatoes and
half-a-dozen of champagne. “If we have to
suffer for our faith,’ said he, “let us do it in tno
best style possible,” and he set about concocting a
compound of potatoes, hard-boiled eggs and
butter, which the company washed down with
good fizz. Never was there a jollier party of
maityrs. Poor Coleridge Davis was with ns and
to his dying day this was one of his favourite
stories. —C.L.

A Bad Quarter-of-an-Hour.*
I stood on the gallows the other day and
read —neatly painted on a beam—the names of
those men whom a well-meaning Government has
thence helped on their way to the happy hunting
grounds. Unfortunately, it was daylight at the
time of my visit, otherwise I am convinced that I
should have been vouchsafed an opportunity of
comparing notes with one or more of those gentle-
men who, like myself, haveenjoyed the advantages
o f a short shrift and a long rope.
I have had what the author of “Our Mutual
Friend” calls “a turn-up with death ” at various
periods of a somewhat chequered existence, but
never was the contest so prolonged, or the result
so doubtful, as on the following occasion.
Never mind the why, when, or how of the
matter, let it suffice that the noose tightened
around my throat and severed my connection with
the outer world. Ino longer possessed a body,
nothing was left of me but my head, and that
reposed in the centre of a vastcycloramic enclosure
whose walls—inscribed with the names and signs
of the various arts and sciences—spun round with
a waving, snakelike motion that made my eyes
throb with a violent pain, nor could I turn them
away, hypnotised as I was by the giddy horror of
that resistless velocity.
As I stared at those flying columns of dancing
figures I was overwhelmed by a sense of the
inutility of man’s existence ; I perceived the
absurdity of his aspirations and the poverty of
his knowledge. I reviewed the progress of the
centuries —not mentally, but actually—inscribed
in detail upon the moving walls of that amphi-
theatre, and then, just as the triumphant thought
came to me that 1 was about to be vouchsafed a
peep into futurity, something snapped, the light
died away, and I felt myself sinking down, down,
down.
# # *
I was on board a ferry-boat which lay near
the Milson’s Point wharf —the old one, where, as a
child, I used to watch for my father. I knew
perfectly what bad happened; we had crashed
into one of the outstanding piers, and were sink-
ing fast. I could hear the wash of the waves as
they danced over the sponson and broke on the
deck, and found myself struggling for life among
a mad crowd of shrieking women and shouting
men. Suddenly the clank of the engines ceased,
and with a scream 1 leaped toward the land, just
in time, for the boiler burst with a roar, scattering
boat and passengers to the four winds.t
« * *
I was lying on the floor ; friends were
round me rubbing my hands and dashing water
over my face. I knew what had happened—l was
dying ; the sword had fallen at last. The doctor
always said my heart was affected, now I knew him
to bo right. Was this Death ? How strange it
felt to be going, going. Oh ! but I didn’t want
fo die, I wouldn’t die ! I hadn’t said good-bye to
Jessie. Where is she ? quick ! quick ! Oh, I can’t
breathe, what s pressing my chest, let me up.
Oh ! oh ! ’ and I came to life.
They cut me down in the nick of time. It was
only a matter of seconds; I was so far on my
journey to the ether world that it took half an
hour of rubbing and pumping to recall me to
earth. They tell me that my first words were
singularly appropriate to the occasion ; as I opened
my eyesismded and murmured cheerfully, “ Ain t
I a fool? ” an opinion of my conduct which I still
retain.
The foregoing account of my short excursion to
the debatable land ’twixt life and death reads
tamely enough on paper, and in fact has but one
verv questionable recommendation, that of truth.

The Uneasiness of the World.
Probably within the last two years more than
during any previous period the sense of impending
evil has more or less appealed to the minds of all
men. Financial institutions have disappeared by
the score—usually peaceful little Republics have
been agitated to their 'very vitals by the slaughter
attendant upon civil war—Anarchism is rampant
—labour troubles are constantly recurring—the
notable lives of well-known men seemingly so
strong, though old, that their admirers said to
themselves, “These will outlive our lives,” have
g. ne out in the space of a thought. Everything
appears ephemeral, life of all kinds, even the
material earth itself. This feeling of apprehension
may be traced partly to the fact that the world is
experiencing a season of commercial depression
and social upheaval which makes the outlook
gloomy, and partly to the heavy list of sudden
deaths caused by the peculiar epidemics of the
time, accentuating in the minds of the survivors
the truth that nothing is certain in life but death.
In very many cases the cause of this deep de-
pression arises from that terrible lassitude which
precedes fully 75 per cent, of the mortality list.
This is but the danger signal of that mortal foe-
kidney disease • the flag hung out to warn the
unhappy patient of the implacable Nemesis on his
track. The truth is that mental worry is certain
to tell upon some vital organ in the human system,
and no portions of that organisation are so
susceptible as those of the kidneys, and sym-
pathetically, the liver. Hence the blood becomes
contaminated with uric acid poison, and endless
troublesome symptoms follow; but the tired
feeling is the most prominent, and general debility
is the result. The only specific is undoubtedly
Warner’s Safe Cure. It searches out the cause
and complete restoration ensues, even in the
worst forms of Fright's disease.

A well-known Australian, who frequents
vice-regal circles, had an insane suspicion that his
wife was “carrying on,” and employed a private
detective to look up the case. There was nothing
unfavourable to report, and the D. sent in his bill
for three weeks’ work. Not being able to get his
coin ho ca su’d defendant and lodged him in gaol.

The Bulletin would warn Sydney’s
much - afflicted amateur newspaper - proprietor
against letting his young men take for granted
sensational barristerial ex-parte statements which
may or may not be borne out by evidence. We
have all heard of late of so many ladies being
kicked and thrown down stairs whilst in an inter-
esting condition by their brutal lords, that tin’s
stock story of the divorce-court is becoming a
trifle stale.
* # #
Chivalry is not yet dead. Less than two
months ago a young fellow, a workman, was
caught trying to get in at the back window of a
mansion in a certain Australian town, township,
or city (we could be more definite if we would). He
was tried for attempted burglary, and allowed
himself to be sent to gaol without speaking a
word in his defence, although he might have pro-
duced a letter inviting him to come to that house
at the midnight hour, and informing him that the
window would bo left unlatched, and although
the girl who wrote it was “ only a servant.”
A marriage shortly
to be performed revives
memories of two big S. A.
divorce-cases. The pro-
spective bride was
divorced from her hus-
band under very naughty
circumstances about three
years ago. She is now
to marry a gentleman
who divorced his wife, a
very prominent Adelaide
mivn being the admittedly
guilty correspondent. The
lady has a substantial
income settled on her by
her former hubby.

the plaintive request of a

One Charles Tozer, alleged to be a four-
years-slipped deserter from H.M.S. Raven, was
arrested at Charters Towers (N.Q.) and taken to
Brisbane, where lie was discharged in the absence
of sufficient identification. The Crown paid his
passage back to the Towers, where he was a second
time arrested without a warrant, but speedily
discharged as being illegally in custody. Later,
be was arrested a third time and once more
remanded to Brisbane. Should the charge hold
good he will be taken away from the Australian
woman whom he has married and her children,
who will all be loft destitute, and will be shipped
to England, there to be confined for years in a
prison. How much longer is Australia going to
endure this sort of thing ?

An officially pleasant feminine postai-
olerk, wherever situated, must, plain or pretty, be
deserving of a poem ; so on public grounds, and
to “ encourage the others,” we allow the obviously
hard-hit bard —no small potatoes, as poets go—to
pour out his little love-song :
Mr. J. M. Fogarty, absconding manager
of Sydney Permanent Mutual Building Society,
COMFORT FOR THE AFFLICTED.
[Up-country Civil servant very ill in bed of influenza. Wife, beaming with pleasure, runs in with official envelope.]
HUSBAND (faintly): “What’s the letter about, my dear?”
WIFE : “ Oh, John, dear, aren’t yon glad—you’ve been appointed to the charge of the cemetery !”
appears to have left a shortage of £ll,OOO. He
confessed on a Saturday to manipulating his
accounts, but “it was thought necessary to
examine the books and see if the statements were
correct before any steps were taken.” Lovely !
for who should have been a better authority on
the matter than Mr. Fogarty ? Mr. F., we further
read, “ promised to return to the office on Monday
morning,” but ere then he “took steps”—to
Valparaiso or somewhere. What have the share-
holders to say to the directors, we wonder?

Skirt-dancing is all the vogue. Countess Russell

The girl who works the “ A B C.”
Her picture? Well, I’ll try and trace
An outline of this lady fair—
A gentle, sweet and loving face
Unfurrowed by a ridge of care,
A pair of sharp yet soft grey eyes,
Half pensive and yet full of glee ;
A head of dark-brown silken hair—
The girl who woiks the “Aii C.’’
A queenly figure, trim and tail;
A shapely bust and stately neck—*
She really is, “for all in all,”
The trump card of the postal deck.
And when her taper fingers run
Through piles of letters, fast and free,
One feels regret when she is done—
The girl who works the “A B C.”
But ’tis not in her face or form
Her brightest attributes appear;
Her manner is her greatest charm,
The same to peasant as to peer ;
Or, speakingin “colonial” phrase,
Tlie bushman and the C.M.G.
By her are treated all the same
The girl who works the “ A B C.”
I'm not a prophet much, and yet
I dare predict that she’s the sort
Of “sorter ” who would grace, you bet,
Alike a cottage or a court.
I trust the lucky man who seals
The holy bonds with her will be
A swain who’ll bring her lots of “ stamps ”
The girl who works the “ A B C.”

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It was on a Sunday mornin’, we was sittin’ on a
rai I
Discussin’ the Natator colt what “ Jim ” bought
at the sale ;
The best of ns had
had a try to stick
upon his back,
But that ho could
“ buck a dandy ”
were a solemn,
frozen fact.
We was all good iron
on horse-back, from
the boss down to
the boy,
And breakin’ in a
rough-’nn were to
us a bit o’ joy ;
But you’d need be
made o’ iron, or
’avo injiarubber
limbs,
And wind like black-
smith’s boilers, to
sit that colt o’
Jim’s.
Now, a gent, named
Montmorency, just
from England rid
the Cape,
Who’d been sent out to
ourst vtiontobe wol-
loped into shape,
MONTMORFNCY
Came over to the fence-rail to w’ero we chaps was
set.
And said that ’e would ride ’im if ’e could get a
but.
You should a-’eard the fellows larf and barrack
“ Johnny Raw,”
For a bigger sight on liorsc-back I think I never
saw, _
And in less than twenty minutes in his book he’d
got us down
Tint he’d stick fur fifteen minutes at a pound to
’arf-a-crowu.
Jim went to get bis colt, which were out runnin
with our nags,
While Monty said he’d change bis “bweeks” as
“ vviding ” spoilt his “ bags ’” ;
He then went off into the
house, and when he re-
appeared
Wo nearly died a-larfing,
while Jones’ filly reared.
He'rl got the latest London
style of coat, and bags,
and boots,
An ! he looked as if he’d
clothed hisself in ’arf-a-
dozoii suits ;
II 3 was the softest-looking
cove, with a chronic,
asthma cough
All collar, cuffs, and over-
coat —by gum ! he was a
toff.
And as he gave a glance
around to see his gear was
tight,
Jim sidled up ter me an’said,
“Say, Bill, this ’ere ain't
right,”
“ I’d ‘vise yer not to ride
the colt,” said Jim to Mr.
Raw,
But he gathered up his
reins and said, “I’m
right, dear boy haw,
haw ! ”
Said Jim, “Nowmind I
told yer, blame yerself
fur wot yer gets,”
And then we ups and told
himwe’d let ’im offbis
bets.
“Oh, now you fellows,
now,”, said he, “I mean
to have a go,
So keep your ‘ thick-’uns ’ handy, 111 win them,
duntcherknow.
“Now, Jim, if you will hold his head I’ll get
myself aboard—
I’d like to get a few more bets, but more I can’t
afford. ”
“Best be content,” I said, “with what you got
and what you’ll get.”
“ You’ll have a pretty sultry time with him,” said
Jim, “ you bet.”’
But when the colt had started work we clever
coveys seen
That this bally masher new-ohum was not so
bloomin’ green,
While the first ten minutes showed us that c
was “ up to snuff,”
And to stick there
until doomsday ’e
were just the bit o’
stuff.
And that colt he
plunged and bucked
and plunged and
lucked hisself rig lit
out,
But in Monty he had
met his match there
wasn’t any d übt,
And lie stuck there
twenty minutes,
though it hardly
made him blow,
And in getting down
ho smilin’ said,
“ I’ve beat you,
duntcherknow !”
We paid him up Ids
winnings, and Jim
he grabbed his list
Ami said, “ My boy,
that ’eve’s a treat
I’m glad I never
missed ;
Praps you warn'd n't
mind ex plain! 11 g
who the you are. ’
“Oh, Pm only just a new-chum and as green as

After all, eo it seems, The Groat Eastern Lode,
of which the public have heard much by cable, is in the
Broken Hill district. We innocently confounded it with
something of a similar name at Gympie. Its location
was a conundrum, notwithstanding repeated assurances
that it really is somewhere on the Barrier. In connection
with this mining mystery, a prospectus lias been issued in
London, a copy of which we have received. It must he a
wonderful property—“another Broken Hill” —or rather
twice as big as Broken Hill—because it has exactly twice
the amount of capital. That of Broken Hill was originally
£160,000. This of the Great Eastern Lode is
is only seven miles from Broken Hill. It might he 700
for all the Australian people know or care. As one evi-
dence of great value the Right Hon. Lord Thurlow, P.C.,
is on Hie Board. He is chairman of the Patents, Mining
and Financial Trust, Limited. That body is also the
promoter, and has fixed the purchase inoney'kt £270,000,
whereof £150,000 is payable in fully paid-up shares, and
£30,000 in cash, and the vendors are willing to take the
remainder in fully paid shares or cash at the option of the
directors. Magnanimous vendors! The property lias
been reported on by two mining engineers, one of whom
we just incidentally notice is a party to one of the con-
tracts for the sale of the concern. There have been
assays I and good assays, too 11 Although the Great
Eastern does not appear to have ever had a ton of its
own ore treated the statistics of the millions of tons and
general results of the operations of the Broken Hill mine,
seven miles away, are given in the prospectus. If the
pub’ic could only learn how much of this £270,000 the
owners of these unknown, unheard-of blocks were getting
they would then understand why it is that the conspicu-
ously rich mines of Australasia are not floated in London.

The end of 1803 should see the railway to Yil-
garn (VV.A.) complete. There are now 165 stampers at
work there, two of the companies are dividend-paying,
and this year should see three more similarly situated.
There is much Adelaide capital in the field, which for 18
months past has averaged loz. to the ton, with big reefs
and lodes in places. The arid Murchison field is also
attracting much attention owing to the break-up of the
drought. Yiigarn has many disadvantages, the principal
the want of a railway; the next, want of fresh water.
There is a land carriage of over 200 miles. It cost the
first company £45 a ton to land a boiler there. All water
except that caught on rocky ground, becomes salt—every
gallon contains half a pound of salt. Water of any kind
is a great luxury; nevertheless, the people bathe occa-

A writer in the Mining Standard says:
“The find in the Painhula Company’s mine is most

which even the manager describes as “ small as yet,” has
been made in a mine distinguished only by the will-o’-the-
wisp nature of its ore !

The Rock vale mine is at Wullomborombi, some
20 miles from Hillgrovo. Having spent some £lO,OOO in
development and the election of a 30-head battery, the
shareholders, mostly Melbourne men, will soon learn the
fate of their enterprise. It is a big lode of low-grade
quartz, largely charged with arsenical jq rites. Haif-an-
oz. will pay dividends. Small ernshings indicate a bigger
return, but it is the average of 10,000 tons that tells.

A few months ago a Northern gold mine was
placed on the Australian market, butaltho’ it was lavishly
advertised after a fortnights wavering, it was withdrawn,

When Mount Morgan was in full boom two
speculators, with more brass than tin (mining joke),
floated a mining company with a high-flown and convinc-
ing name —in 500 shares of £l5O each. One worked the
garni in Queensland whilst the other ran the quarry to
earth in the south. Even at this price they found many
fools to singe their wings, but an engineer who was sent
up to report upon the show returned with the announce-
ment that the main shaft was sunk in a river bed (then
dry from a prolonged drought) and forwarded his opinion
that the first time Jupiter Pluvius began business there
would be an end to the mine. That broke up the concern,
and although several very hasty things were said, noth-
ing came of it and the plunder was divided —£ll,ooo
cash and about in hills (promptly dishonoured
upon maturity). Amongst the P.N.’s were those of a

will wager that lie will win again, although there ere
several shafts there over 20 JO feet, viz., Carden Cully
United, Garibaldi, Shenandoah, Old Chum and New dun i
Railway. The geological theory went down in Bendjuo
only 25 years ago that gold would not be got below 300
feet.

Lansell was originally a soap-manufacturer in
Bendigo, and many were the complaints made against the
odour of bis works in View Point. The money made in
soap went into mines, wherewith be amassed an enormous
fortune. In 1872, when Bendigo a\eiaged £40,000 in
div.dends a -week; often more than one-balf went into
Lansell’s pockets, lo say nothing of the money he made
out of his own claims. His practice is to buy up forfeited
shares of fancied companies, and w hen he lias secured a
controlling interest to work them in a big way.

It is the one big thing in mining which a man
once in a lifetime misses that lie remtnihcis. Ask the
members of a certain hoard in Sydney, who for many
years past have had amongst them a Mount Morgan
magnate, why it is that they did not get into that mine,
and you may hear something like the following. It was
brought under their notice several limes in its early and
cheap stage of existence. Accustomed to get into nearly
every scheme at dead level because of that incomprehen-
sible something known as “influence,” each was appalled
at the amount asked to he subscribed for a sixteenth
share, viz., ,£IOCO. It has often been ivg.nkd by each of
them as an insignificant sum since, hut at the time it was
rather peremptorily declined with, “ft’s hardly good enough
for a mining venture, anyhow,” or “Is there no other way
of getting in on the never?” or “ What do you want with
all that money?” and thereupon one would give his ex-
perience lo demonstrate that to put money into a mine
was to hid it farewell for ever. The revenge of the other
man was sweet when the proffered sixteenth interest
came to represent a million. “Well, you had (he first
chance, and refused. It is returning me £25,000 a year,
and will last a lifetime.” Worse still, when asked logo
into anything of theirs the millionaire would decline, on
the ground that it was too small a thing for him t.> bother
with. And they have never since been able to find any-
thing big enough to attract him.

The finds at the new rush near Mount Magnet,
in the Murchison gold district (W. A.), have been indus-
triously exaggerated. About 70 men are up there, and
provisions are almost unobtainable. When procurable,
their prices surpass the famine charges of the first
Palmer (N.Q.) rush : flour, 4s. per lb. ; rice, 2s. per lb. ;
dried peas (I), Is. 6d. per lb. However, water and grass
are plentiful, and the gold is believed to be there.

Silver Queen mine (West Coast, Tasmania)
which a few T months ago started paying div idends and
was looked upon as the trump-card of Tasmanian silver
mining, has fallen in public esteem. Shares which weie
selling at £9 before the V.D.L. Bank smash were at latest
down to 15s. with a falling tendency. The largest share-
holder is a Hobart grocer who is said to have refused
£9OOO for 1000 shares —a very small proportion of the
number he possesses - and to have been considered wise
in having refused to part.
A Funny Game.
A few friends met the other night in a Newtown
store to spend a jovial evening, but as they were
all teetotallers and none of them drank anything
stronger than Clements Tonic, drunkenness was
out of the question. Mac. proposed a game
at euchre, and Jones said they had better play for
something just to give the game an interest and
make it lively, but times were hard, so they did
not care to play for money. Smith, however,
spied a box of Fletcher's bilious and liver pills,
and proposed that each time a man was beaten he
should take a pill, and this made the game lively
and the fun was fast and furious. Simpson
swallowed five, Jones got away with four and
Smith and Hopkins two each and Mac. got off
scot free. The game terminated by a general
exodus at 3 a.m., for Dr. Fletcher’s pills never
labour in vain. They are the best and mildest
pills made and are sold by ail chemists and
druggists everywhere; being a positive, safe,
and reliable cure for constipation, liver complaint,
headache, &c. They always give satisfaction.
The proprietors give away <£so (in seven prizes) at
Xmas, for the seven first nearest guesses sent in,
as to how many of these pills a large Clements
Tonic bottle (now full) holds. A guess form is
around every box, and all such forms are eligible
for this competition that come from around a box.
One box of Fletcher’s Pills proves their virtues
and they can be obtained everywhere at Is., or

IHE LAWYER WAS “LEFT.”
AN EPISODE IN COURT.
A defendant in the District Court the other day,
who appeared to answer a summons for having
neglected to settle up with his tailor, succeeded
admirably in discomfiting a rather smart young
lawyer who was putting him through a severe
cross-examination concerning his ability or other-
wise to liquidate the sartorial claim. When every
source of wealth and income which might presum-
ably be available to the debtor had been suggested,
■only to prove as unproductive of results as the
late Royal Commission on Strikes, the eye of the
man of law rested enviously upon an unpretentious
■chain that depended from the vest pocket of the
witness. “I see you can afford to carry a watch ;
I presume that it at least might be considered of
stotne value.” “Not a better timekeeper in the
•colony,” was the response. “Maybe you’d like to
have a look at it. It only cost mo 13s. Gd., and
I’ve had it for five years,” he remarked, a’s he
jpassed over to the nonplussed barrister a series
■“ E.” Waterbury. “It has never been repaired,
either, although it keeps as good time now as the
day I bought it.” The witness was on oath, as
he spoke nothing but truth. It is an established
fact that there are no more reliable or popular in-
expensive watches than the Waterburys, whether
they take the shape of the old, plain,'serviceable
“E.” or the much more ornate and highly-
finished “K ” and “N” series. These latter are
encased in nickel, sterling silver, or rolled gold, to
suite the taste and purse of the purchaser, are
jewelled in six holes, have superior short-winding
and stem-setting appliances, a beautiful appear-
ance, and every improvement up to date that
American enterprise and ingenuity could suggest.
The prices range from 255. to GTs. Gd.

Hie Petit Journal (Paris), daily circula-
tion a million and aquarter, is printed on paper
manufactured from fir-tree pulp. It uses up
120,000 fir-trees a year, taking the average height of
each fir at 00ft. This clears 25,000 acres annually.
Of course, with such a good thing “ on,” care is
taken to keep the firs planted in Norway and
Austria, where they come from.
A Northern correspondent points out in
reference to recent Bulletin paragraphs that the
present Admiral Pieernautle did not marry a
daugh'er °f Mr. Isaacs, at one time N.S. W.
Solicitor-General. The lady married a naval
lieutenant of that name but he died and Mrs.
I reemantle, nee Isaacs, in 1878 married an army-
officer, Capt. Robinson. Also, Morell Mackenzie
was not struck off tho rolls of the College of
Physicians after the publication of his book
‘Frederick the Noble” but resigned after being
censured by that body. In other words, it was
going to remove him, and he, knowing that fact,
got there first.
Dear Bulletin,— “ Hon. P. Buckley,
Attorney-General of Maoriland, has left Welling-
ton for Sydney to meet the new Governor,” says
a recent cablegram. I was a resident of Grey-
mouth, West Coast, in the Sixties, and I think
it was in GS, just about the time of ‘‘the Fenian
riots ” on the Coast, that Pat, then a Wellington
solicitor, first sought to enter Parliament for our
constituency. Mr. B.’s special qualification for
the position of M.H.R. was his utter antipathy
to anything English, a sentiment made conspicu-
ously noticeable by his bowld conduct at a ban-
quet some time prior to this at Wellington. When
Queen Victoria’s health was proposed he scoffingly
struck up the “ Wearing o’ the Green” (does he
do it, I wonder, now that he is Attorney-General?)
Mr. B. expected to scoop the whole of the Irish
vote, then pretty strong on the Coast. He notified
that he would arrive in Greymouth by a certain
steamer and meet the electors. Eor some reason
or other he did not arrive by that steamer, but
instead of him came old Joe Kilgour, Donald
M‘Lean, and one or two other celebrities. Old
Joe had come across a donkey—a rare animal to
find in those days. He bought it and brought it
along with him. Knowing the ovation that
awaited the budding member, the party conceived
a happy idea. They took that donkey and en-
cased his front legs and forepart in a magnificent
frock-coat, his rear ones in grey continuations, into
which they dexterously tucked his tail, fixed up his
throat with a huge paper collar and tie, ruined a
brilliant bell topper by making holes in it to give
his ears a fair chance to flap, and finished him off
with a placard : “This is Buckley, your future
M.H.R.” Meanwhile, the Fiery Cross had been
sent round and the faithful summoned from gully
and bar to do honour to the man who had so nobly
refused to drink the health of a bloodthirsty
tyrant. Some of them had already misjudged
their capacity, and were in a state further advanced
than the occasion warranted, and had to be held
in position while the steamer made fast. The
gangway was put out, and ashore walked the
donkey, prodded behind by old Joe, in his wall-'
known white hat. That is all the story. The
agonised howl which went up from the wild Irish-
men on the wharf can’t be put into print. For
one moment they felt inclined to make a murderous
assault on the affable mule ; then they went away,
and left the base and brutal Saxon and liis ass in
possession of the field.—Yours, D.G.
KISSNG IN THE STRÈET
Surreptitiously extracting bliss from
the lips of a pretty girl has not infrequently
proved a costly form of enjoyment to the
“kisser;” but it is only once in a lifetime that a
man receives punishment in any shape for kissing
his own wife. They manage that kind of thing
in Boston, however. According to a recent cable-
gram to an English paper, a prominent citizen of
the “hub of creation” and his better half were
arrested there for having violated the ordinance
which prohibits “kissing in the street.” The
guilty pair were what is usually termed “newly,
married,” and happening to meet in the street
after a few days’ separation, they proceeded to
indulge in a mild matrimonial salute, thereby
“bringing themselves,” as a newspaper report
informs us, “ under one of the old Puritan bylaws
which has never been repealed.” Now, one of the
chief recommendations of a kiss is spontaneity,
and the proverb that “stolen kisses are sweet”
is as true as it is timeworn. Eortunately, in
Australia there are no antiquated restrictions in
force as in Boston, and whether upon the wharf,
at the door of an omnibus, on the railway-plat-
form, or under the sheltering fig-trees in the
public park, persons of the opposite sexes may
indulge in the osculatory exercise that gives zest
to an affectionate meeting or leave-taking, with-
out being subject to the interference of the “ man
in blue.” No person of sober judgment will deny
to a fellowman the right to participate in this
most innocent of all pleasures, when and where
he pleases, any more than will those who have
tried it and proved its efficacy deny that St.
Jacobs Oil is par excellence the remedy of the age
in all cases of muscular disease, and that in the
treatment of burns, sprains, and cuts it is un-
approachable in healing qualities. Even after
the failure of medical skill to effect a cure, St.
Jacobs Oil has asserted its claims and restored
patients to their normal condition of health, in
testimony of which Mr. William Purcell, a miner
on the Mount Zeehan silver fields, writes : “Some
five months ago I met with an accident by a
small tree falling across my back. It gave me
what they call a ricked back, and I suffered a
great deal of pain from it. The local doctor
treated me for it, but gave me no relief, and I
got a bottle of St. Jacobs Oil and tried that.
Three applications of it proved sufficient to put
me all right again, so I have no hesitation in
saying that it is a splendid remedy. I may say
that the oil has a great name on the silver fields,
where it is extensively used for sprains, neuralgia,
rheumatism, and the like.


The British cable-liar has always some
favourite locality where he plants his most blood-
thirsty stories—that is, he plants them there till
the locality gets full up of gore. Mexico is the
favourite spot nowadays. The last horror from
that region is the story of a jilted maiden who
wreaked a fearsome revenge on her faithless lover
and his bride—she chloroformed the pair of them,
and then cut their tongues out, after which she
fatally stabbed a policeman who tried to arrest
her. This sort of atrocity is painful reading, and
it is still more horrible to reflect that the Mexican
journalist may possibly be. also hard up for a
sensation at this very moment, and may be tilling
his “ speshul ’dishun ” with a gory tale of how six
“ barn-darncing ” society ladies disembowelled
each other in Sydney Domain for love of an aide-
de-camp, and how the seventh one put the aide-
de-camp’s eyes out with a hair-pin, and then
poured boiling water over the Government House
infant, and finally fled shrieking out of a top
window and was impaled on the door-scraper.
Picturesque horrors like these are always planted
a long way off. and Sydney would do very well as
a location for the Mexican editor’s scalp-yarns.
PEMELL’S

It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Co.’s “Cascade,
80 and 82 Elizabeth-street, near King-street, is
just the place; it is certainly the largest and best-
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there, so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*

“Working Off" Deeming.

# * *
Mr. Foy, Deputy-Governor, was, it pre-
sently transpired, warning the press to hurry up
and take their places within the Gaol, and we
stormed the gruesome citadel forthwith. When the
gatekeeper opened the gate the advance-guard of
the army scaled a little stone staircase, and tobk lijl
a commanding position oh,the first landing, exactly
Opposite fch'e “ chop” landing—a gangway, arid h
middle landing; Or bridge;,illtetvepibg; About 18
Be'ople in dll Held this coign, of vantage', and were
vaguely understood to be the Press. One of them
was a long, rakish ruin with a light-blue waist-
coat, who gave a bank holiday flavour to
the proceedings. The balance of the Press
and public (some 30 in all) occupied the floor of
the quadrangle, and, gazing upwards at the plat-
form reserved for Deeming, .waited patiently for
something to happen. The monotony was broken
by the flitting of Hangman Jones and his assistant
across the stage. They came from the cell on the
prompt side and disappeared in the o.p. dungeon,
where Deeming was expecting them. Jones, a
burly, sailor-like individual, sported the long,
white* false beard in which he always goes to
business, whilst the assistant, also_ muscular and
nautical, carried a black beard of his own raising;
Then time began to hang again, and the Sheriff
seemed to be lingering* He wasn’t, hoWeVer* The
Sheriff was strictly punctual. At three minutes
to ten he came lip the stone stairs, with Dr;
ieldsi * *
Dheming Was albne oh the drop. Therh
had been a .slight commotion , at, the door of His
cell, and lo ! Deeming Held the stage, motionless,
and apparently troubled in his mind. He never
looked round to see if any ladies were present,
but, with his legs pressed close together, and his
wan face turned to his new prison boots, awaited
his destiny like a courageous animal.
-V;
It was an improving spectacle. “ Moses ’
Jones, the Sheriff, Drs. Shields and Stewart, and
a few warders as supernumeraries, were grouped
behind and on either side of the victim. The
parson, with his little Testament, faced the
audience well in the foreground to the left. A
muffled Voice, scarcely audible to folks in front,
broke the silence and a muffled rejoinder came
from the gentleman in the centre* The Sheriff
had exhorted the faded creature ih the slop-
made jail suit to say anything he could think
of before departing in peace. Deeming had
ip his turn asked the Lord to receive his
Spirit —which departed almost immediately-
Jbnes pulled the white Cap ovbr the facb of
[lit, prey arid slipped the rope rburid his flebk;
The clergyimin, looking at the flongregation oil
the first landing, spoke brie line of the Burial
Service and got a short distance into the next
paragraph—“ For man that is born of a woman ”
—click! “Woman” was the cue for the mock
patriarch in the white beard to do his worst. In
the name of Fred. Bailey Deeming’s mother
apparently, her son was allowed to drop through
the floor. ,
h # «
The sickening thud was noticeably absent
—anyway, it couldn’t bfe detected amidst the noisC
of the machinery. Nor was there a treitlblirig of
the rope or ariything special to please the evening
hotrormongers; save the fact that the last dread
sentence of the law had been satisfactorily fulfilled
by the persbri at the end of the line. Deeming
had gorie straight fot once,in l.iis life. He went
as straight as a die orit of this Wicked World. The
blind attached to a long roller under the drop
platform was let down, and the audience, after
taking a friendly peep at the suspended item
behind the canvas, went sorrovvfully away.
Whether they felt sorry that Deeming had gone,
or sorry at being obliged to go themselves was
hard to say. They constituted a mixed lot and
their sentiments were varied.
# * *
Out again in the gaol yard it was pleasant
to hear that the working off of Deeming had been
a gland success, and a comfort to all who knew
him. Dr. Shields said that the job was well done,
whilst the parson was thankful to know that his
charge had died penitent. As far as a lunatic can
die penitent, Deeming had accomplished the feat,
no doubt. But it is improbable that he died well,
judging from his appearance just prior to the
event. , *
#« . *
We were to see a lot more of Deeming
before we left the gaol premises. J hanks to the
courtesy of the gentleman who worked the oracle,
we paid a long return visit to the scene of the
sacrifice, and criticised the cold clay of Deeming,
deceased. Two or three medical men were hold-
ing a discussion at the feet of Deeming (who still
had half-an-hour to hang) and we learned many
things about that prize criminal. First of all we
found that he died with a livid, swollen tongue
between his teeth, and an appearance of a placid
smile upon the top half of his face. the cap
being pulled back upon his brow, we could study
the corpse’s countenance at leisure. He had, as
a doctor suggested, two sides to his face, one
of them the “business” side where his wrinkles
chiefly congregated, and the other the feeble side
where he didn’t seem to know what he was
doing. Looking at Deeming as he hung on to
the last chance the law had given him, it was
strange that nobody thought of him as an ex- ,
human being, although he certainly looked like a
human being who had got something tied tight
round his neck —but the subject is glowing un-
pleasant We felt a thrill of satisfaction upon
discovering that the hands of Deeming were
folded as in prayer behind his back, for there
seemed to be a good deal in the penitence theory,
after all. To his credit be it said that the wretch
wasn’t aggressively penitent and didn t drop con-
fessions about in the manner imagined by the
daily press. He casually mentioned in one of his
stray prayers that he regretted having sent his
wives and families out of the world without the
same amount of preparation that he was hnnsel
enjoying, but in worldly conversation lie stuck to
Jiis innocence like aJeech right up to; the last. On
ithe Spnday night he had felt aggrieved because
the chief warder couldn’t conscientiously admit to
him that he considered Deeming a deeply-injured
mar. Ho died an enigma. They gave him a com-
forting dose of brandy in a medicine measuring-
glass (we smelt the dregs to assure ourself that
it was James Hennessy, wondering the while what
G. D. Clark, little Mirams, and the rest of the
“ teetottlers ” would think about those who had
dosed with alcohol a man just about to enter
Heaven), and he went to his doom like one who
had never quite made up hiB mind whether he
bOrrimittßd the iriurdets or othfetwise;
, Tits BuLIeTIN repeats, that. tl]e, Victorian
)£gal authorities who refused-to allow the hanged
murderer Deeming’s brain to be inspected by
scientists, but, apparently in the interests of their
own amour propre and to prevent a possible shock
to the alleged public conscience, hastily covered
up and cemented under the prison hearthstone the
carrion they had made, are as mean and brutal and
uncivilised as was the assassin himself. The law
should be founded on truth, and should be pre-
pared to face the truth, even though the whole
social fabric crumble in the dust-
The only assets which Deeming possessed
in his last hours were his brains and his manu-
scripts. The official assignee at Sydney wants
the latter as part of his bankrupt estate; Deeming s
tailor has a verdict and means to levy ; and
Marshal Lyle has a lien on them for his costs.
Also the Victorian authorities have foreclosed on
the brains, and a dreadful rumour has been afloat
for some time that the convict ate the manuscript
and drank the ink along with it. It looks like
something less than a farthing in the pound for
outside creditors. The murderer read the Bible
a good deal in the final hours of his
existence, but he remarked regretfully that
it was a rather dry description of mental
victuals, and that he would prefer one of Zola s
novels. It would be interesting to know what
part of the Bible he fixed upon. Most probably
he spent his last days reading up the wars and
elopements and bigamies of the ancient Israelites,
and how the old prophets were found dead under
hearthstones in Palestine, and the hanging of
Saul’s sons, and found much comfort therein. lie
also expressed his sorrow that he hadn t made
Marshall Lyle’s acquaintance long ago, as things
might then “ have been different.’ Whether they
would have been different for him, or for Lyle, he
didn’t explain, but The Bulletin’s opinion is
that they would have been different for Lyle.
There seems to have been a heavy mortality
among the people who knew Deeming in his active
days, and Lyle would probably have been dead by
now.
Ballarat has started an “ Unbreakable
Bank.” This is a good idea seeing that so many
Australian banks have proved such “ soft snaps.’’

approval, an article from Lippincott’s, in which
it is stated that “the stock-in-trade of every
solidly-established newspaper is the news that it

enough to think it has put the case just as neatly:
“It is not the Press which is the power. It is

GOLDEN SHAN T Y
The Nights at Rocky Bar.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I lapping' brumbies in the moonlight! those were
) nights of reckless fun,
Way back on Campbell's country—on the Goorv-
bibil run,
' K 'n saddled up and ready our impatient nags
would .stand
W Idle we squatted in the gunyah with their bridle-
reins in hand.
And presently the hoof-beats of the brumbies’ trot
would sound
As they rattled o’er the ridges of the mulga-
timbered ground ;
Iheyd be thirsty, for that stretching trot had
brought them from afar,
And the only water for them was the hole at
Rocky Bar.
We would hear the stallions whinny, and then the
water splash—
That latter was our signal—through the dead wood
with a crash
We were at them—you on Joker, lon II ulo-
quin, and. Mick
Would be with us, just as eager as his jumper,
Bis tern wick.
Our stockwhips in the stilly night like rifle-shots
would ring
When we beat them on the Bilbee Flat and
slewed ’em to the wing ;
And when we had ’em yarded, oh, the clatter and
the din!
How they kicked and squealed and sno ted when
they found themselves barr’d in !
The nights the brumbies tried to break straight
back the way they came
Proved Harlequin as nimble as we knew him to
be game ;
In those rushing, frantic scrambles ’twas his
cleverness I thank
That I didn t get a smasher down that rotten
basalt bank.
One old “ Merino ” came out, and some boundary
rider's moke ” _
He was riding—it was his fault that the chestnut
stallion broke—
He sung out: “Nevermind him; let the beggar
go away !”
But you didn’t stop to listen, Jack, to what he
had to say.
And ere you brought the big horse back yon had
a roughish ride,
The Lord knows how you managed, mate, that
night to save your hide !
1 hough bar a stake of sandalwood you weren’t a
great deal hurt,
Though the gidya ripped your moleskins, and the
mulga rent your shirt.
That big timber took some dodging, but our hacks
were tried and true,
And while their heads were left alone would
mostly get us through ;
But never a horse, save Harlequin, at night, ’twas
my belief
Could race among those bilbee holes and yet not
come to grief.
And then we’d jog away to camp two miles below
the Bar,
W hero we’d find a pipe of Nailrod and a nobbier in
the jar.
Ah ! though our lines of life since then have lain
in diverse ways,
We don’t forget those gallops of the brumby-
running days.
THE BREAKER.
Six of Melbourne Standard’s boy-re-
porters have been enrolled as “ pupil ” members of
the Victorian Journalists’ Institute. The president
will soon be able to announce with pleasure, at
monthly meetings, the interesting fact that “our
young colleague, Mr. Blank wrotty ” has cut another
tooth.
On April 29, four Chinamen were hanged
at Perth (\V. A.), for murder : three for the killing
of another Chinaman, and one for the slaying of a
white man named Fairhead. They were hanged
in couples, and each met his fate with Asiatic
philosophy. The convicts were only apprised of
the finality of their sentences two days before the
execution, and immediately remarked in chorus :
“All li’; sposce you hangee stlait off, all li’! ”
There are in Switzerland nineteen associa-
tions which collect old, infected cigar-stumps from
the gutters and ash-heaps, and sell them for
charitable purposes. It is gratifying to know that
in the last twelve months these societies have
clothed 1720 poor children out of the proceeds of
their industry. All the same we intend for the
future to smoke only cigars that are prepared by
tome hard hearted race which doesn’t care whether
the poor are clothed or not. The Swiss variety of
benevolence has germs in it.
Melbourne Daily Telegraph was pro-
bably the only journal that ever died of too much
capital. But it also had a dropsy of religion. It
was edited from the pulpit, and prominent reli-
gious organisations were controlled frun its edi-
torial sanctum. The Melbourne D.T. made its
compositors and literary staff work on Saturday
nights, but would not permit the typos, to snatch
stamps on Sundays until the midnight hour had
struck. So the unregenerate printers used to
assemble “in chapel ” every Sunday evening
about !) o’clock at a law-defying pub. near the
office and pass the time in devotional beers until
midnight, when they staggered conscientiously to
work for the Monday morning’s paper. As for
the subeditor, he, poor devil! had to work all
Saturday afternoon and all day on Sunday. A
sub-editor’s soul is hardly ever worth saving.
It is a good rule to accept only such medicines
as are known to be worthy of confidence. It has
beep the experience of thousands that Ayer’s
Cherry Pectoral is the best medicine ever used for
throat and lung diseases.

His Opportunity.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Lowin' hated Frank Loud with a growing hatred
the hate of a small, ugly man for his large,
handsome rival. They Were mates, and members
of a party of six, the successful tenderers for the
sinking of the Bnnyip shaft to a depth of 200
feet. Lowry and Bond were excellent friends
whilst they lived apart, and frequently caroused
in each other’s company with a great display of
affection, but shortly after Bond went to board
with Lowry, at the latter’s solicitation, a coolness
sprang up between them.
Perhaps this coolness was all on Lowry’s side;
Bond was apparently unconscious of it, and made
himself extremely comfortable under the roof and
at the table of the man who could have cut his
throat with the keenest enjoyment, had the mere
hacking with the razor been the end of all. Yes.
Peter Lowry yearned to kill his mate with a
yearning compared with which mere ambition
becomes a trivial desire. Prank often turned
suddenly and caught the eyes of his host
fixed upon him with a peculiar hungry look
in their yellowish depths. At such times
Peter was possessed of an idea fascinated
with a thought of plunging his knife into
the boarder’s thick neck; or absorbed in the
study of an imaginative picture of Bond with a rope
drawn round his throat and gradually tightening,
whilst the veins of his forehead distended
and turned purple, and his eyes swelled in his
head. This usually occurred at meals. Possibly, his
complete unconsciousness of his mate’s reflections
was accountable for Bond’s remarkable appetite.
He always ate well, and was grateful for Mrs.
Lowry’s attention. Probably, he was quite in-
different to the feelings of Mr. Lowry, whose
back ho could have broken without an extra-
ordinary effort.
Mrs. Lowry was a dark woman of about thirty,
with straight, black hair, quick, purple-hued eyes,
and a pale face, made peculiar by reason of the
thin and very red lips of a large mouth. Bond
thought her handsome.
Lowry was nearly twenty years older than his
wife. He was conscious that she cherished no
very ardent affection for himself, but no jealous
thought had entered his head till shortly after
Bond took lip his residence with them. Then
he began to see that he had been a fool to in-
troduce into bis home a man still under forty,
and possessed of a certain brute beauty that
pleases many women. He watched ihis wife
and Frank, and thought he detected evidence
sufficient to confirm his worst suspicions; and
now his life became a continuous torment of
jealous rage and thirst for vengeance. He did not
ask Bond to leave the house ; he wished to have
him at hand and to watch- and wait for his oppor-
tunity. He cherished no desire to strike at his
wife excepting through her lover.
Peter plotted ; lie elaborated fantastic plans for
the destruction of bis mate —plans that he knew
were quite beyond accomplishment, but it was
some little relief to imagine Bond suffering, bleed-
ing, dying or dead.
The husband and the boarder never drank
together now. Peter became a total abstainer
and sat at home and sulked and dreamed of his
opportunity.
He meant to do the deed well, to secure an
effective revenge, and in such a manner that sus-
picion would not rest upon him. When Bond was
gone he wished to live quietly with his wife—he
must not bo troubled witli fears of discovery.
Strangely enough, his faithless wife was never
included in the scheme of revenge.
Lowry had one good idea that he often dwelt
upon—it was his best, but it was not quite satis-
factory, and, besides, Bond’s prejudice against
turning the drill rendered its consummation im-
probable. Frank always preferred to use the
hammer when they were putting in a hole below
—he prided himself upon his skill in beating a
drill. Any other mate would have agreed to this
readily enough, but of late Peter had often ex-
pressed a desire to take a turn with the sled. He
imagined Bond sitting under him with bent head
turning the drill, whilst he swung the hammer.
How easy to slip and send the heavy tool crashing
into his mate’s skull !
One afternoon Lowry and Bond were below
putting in timber. Frank was kneeling in a corner
of the working shaft with a pick in his hand,
squaring up ; Peter worked back in the other end,
putting in centres. A candle lit up the shaft witli
a feeble, yellow glare.
Suddenly there camo a shriek from the brace-
man :
“ LooJc out below!”
Then a rushing sound, and a bang. The man
on top, whilst loading timber into the bucket, had
dropped a centre; it struck, end on, within a foot
of Bond, as he knelt in the corner, and jerked the
clay and water into his eyes and face, blinding
him.
This was Lowry’s opportunity.
Like lightning the idea flashed into his brain.
He rushed at the centre, seized the heavy piece of
green timber, and, raising it high in his hands,
drove the edge into Frank’s head just above tin-
right ear, crushing the skull like a walnut. Bond
fell on his face in the water, without a groan.
It was all done in less than three seconds.
The braceman called, in terror
“ Anybody hurt, below ?”
“Send down the bucket!” Lowry’s voice
betrayed nothing.
The bucket was lowered, and Peter lifted the
dead man into it, secured the body to the rope
with the tether, and ordered :
“ Heave up—man on!’’
He watched the bucket ascend, and was seized
with a violent fit of trembling. He sank upon his
knees, and listened, and presently the braceman’s
cry echoed down the shaft:
“Great God! Dead!”
Then Lowry grinned. Why had he played this
horrible practical joke? He did not know—it was
a devilish impulse that seized upon him in the
confusion of thought following the deed.'
Next morning the Bendigo papers recorded the
sad death of a miner named Bond—killed in the
Bunyip shaft by a blow from a piece of timber
accidentally dropped by the braceman.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Dear Bulletin,—You print from JST.Y. Wheel
an article designed to show that in America and England
“along the line of physical supremacy, amateur and pro-
fessional, lies mediocrity,” and after quoting “physical
wrecks,” “after-life senility,” and “middle-life ob-
scurity,” you finish up by saying, on your own account,
“And isn’t all this true of Australia.” The article may
be right enough as regards Europe and America, but to
your query I distinctly say “No!” and quote a few
Sydney examples I can remember on the spur of the
irioment. Taking the fighters: the Sparks are living to a
green old age, and their descendants are nleri and Women
df respectability and siibStanoe ; Larry FOley is a respect;
ttble citizen in perfect healfli and a nlari of reputed
wealth ; Sandy Ross is still as tough als a bit of
green-hide and drives a cab about Sydney streets’.
Amongst the sprinters, Frank Hewitt looks little
older than he did a-quarter of a century ago, and the last
time the writer saw “Scone” Watson the flying stripling
had developed into a middle-aged man of aldermanic pro-
portions. Amongst the amateurs, the mile-runners
“Pros.” Williams, Metcalfe, and “Dave” Middleton have
proved, like “Teddy” Simpson, anything but failures in
middle-life ; and when we come to amateur oarsmen, we
commence a big list of anything but middle-aged failures
either physically or socially. The brothers Fitzhardinge
and Deloitte, the Garvans, “Charley” Lett, “Jim”
Murphy, poor “Jim ” Clark, and his brothers “ Bob ” and
George, “Fred.” Hall, “Charley” Oliver, “Billy’’Cope,
“Billy” Anslow, and the list’oould be continued long,
enough to fill a column of your paper. B. R. Wise was a
Champion in his line, as was Gov. “ Jarsey,” although it
must be confessed that the latter scarcely looks up to
retired Australian form. I had intended to stop here, but
find I am leaving out the best examples Of all —out pro-
fessional retired scullers—Trickett, Laycock, Beach, Lyons,
“ Footy ” Pearce, Solomon, and numerous other men at
the present day who earn an honest livelihood and are fit
to be taken the world over as models of middle-age
physical condition. Again I reply to your query —No !

A special meeting of the Y.R.G., called at the
instance of several pony-meeting mongers, gave the
racing parliament an opportunity to sit solemnly and
heavily upon the movement for encouraging cheap and
nasty “sport.” Resolutions in favour of shortening
courses to suit ponies, reducing stakes and increasing
entrance-fees were rejected without a division. The feel-
ing of the “house,” about 120 members being present,
was with the speaker who said that “they recognised
pony-racing only as an evil,” and hinted that the coming
revision of V.R.C. rules would be intended to restrict the
number of bookmaker and blasphemy fixtures. No dis-
interested man possessing a knowledge of horse-racing
and its influences will object to autocratic government
in the Turf world. It doesn’t matter a pin whether the
V.R.C. is a benevolent or selfish despot as long as the
despotism puts a heavy duty on racing (so to speak) and
makes it too much of a luxury to become an article of
everyday consumption. Petty suburban meetings, where
most of the horses are cronk, and many of the owners,
jockeys and trainers are cronker still, and where most of
the expectorating attendance ought to be in gaol—such
meetings have no more right to exist than the “ shy ”
pubs., where harlots dispense virulent poison to thieves
and fools.

What puzzles the English sports are the lordly
moustaches on Tommy Corrigan and Tommy Hales,

The Sullivan-Kemp race should be won by
Sullivan—or three races. Sullivan was not donkey-licked
by Stanbury—far from it. Stanbury is a draught-horse
in the form of athletic man ; moreover, he is the backer’s
ideal. The man who sleeps so soundly just before a race
that blocks of ice have to be placed on his stomach to
awaken him—that is the man to back. Kemp, plucky
and finished sculler though he is, always fretted. He
will think, and thought is an athlete’s curse. In our
opinion, Sullivan is the link between Stanbury and
Kemp*
* * *
They say that Sullivan showed the “ stable ” a
better trial than ever Searle did. But, then, the time
test is worthless, except on such non-tidal Courses as the
American lakes. In their memorable race Searle always
jjdd Stanbury safe.

Bill Murphy, in the ’Frisco (U.S.A.) press, goes

jS true that Qritfo can’t fight Murphy on paper.

The Secret of a “crack” Victorian footballer’s
desire to change his colours is usually centred in a cigar-
shop. The supporters of a rival club notify the cultured
kicker that a snug little tobacconist business is waiting
for his name to be painted up over the window, where
upon he applies to the V.F.A. for a permit to shift his
quarters. The V.F.A. makes a pretence of enquiring into
these exchange] and barter transactions, but is really
powerless to prevent them. A thwarted footballer'might
at any time pour forth a flood of revelations that would
wash all decent interest out-of the “ national game ” and
leave it struggling in a noisome slough of larrikinism and
blasphemy.
# # #
Tiiose who like to see real good milling, need
not look for it in the big halls, where often gold has to be
paid to witness a readied-up affair. In the Sydney suburbs,
for a shilling, one may witness gory fights between the
Griffos and Slavins of the future.

Unless good authorities are mistaken, Johnel
is not the first great pug of that name who visited Aus-
tralia. Yankee Sullivan, who proceeded Morrissey and
Heenan, as American champion, visited London in the
height of his career, and was spotted as a promising East-
end pug. of Irish parents who had been “ lagged” years
before. Investigation showed be must have landed in
California in ’49 with a batch of “ Sydney coves.”
A few days more, football and monkey’s allow-
ance will form the mid-day topic in King-st., Sydney.
The senior clubs are all in training, and as the Maori-

it is to be hoped that the Cornstalks have made their
peace with Heaven.

Murdoch and Ferris held the batting and bowling

Messrs. Allt and Co., of Sydney, agents for
Robertson’s whisky, have offered, on behalf of the
proprietors of that well - known liquor, a gold
medal, to be competed for in the five-mile race at the
bicycle carnival to be held in Sydney on 21st and 28th
May. Also, they offer, on their own behalf, a silver cup,
to be rowed for by the Workmen of Mortlake, on the
Parramatta River. Thus does the liquor-man get ahead
of his enemy once more. The teetotaller climbs over the
fence and sees the show free, while the dealer in the
“soul-destroying fluid” offers prizes, and booms his
alcohol thereby,

The manager of one of the London half-penny
papers told a Bulletin correspondent, the other day, that
the baOk-bOne of such journals is sporting news, and that
the circulation of his paper falls off to the extent of from
30,000 to 35,000 a day after the close of the flat-racing
season.

The “ La Blanche blow ” was Used before “ I 1 he

wrestling, garotting, &c., were permitted it was far from
effective.

Maoriland has sent Australia many good horses
and many most disappointing ones, so far as concerns
backers. Without going so far back as the days of Mata,
we have Manton, Cuirassier, Tirailleur, Medallion, Wha-
kawai, Enfilade, &c., &c. Sir Modred was only partially
successful, a remark also applying to Nelson, but the
latter was Victorian-bred.

Whenever an owner declares his horse to be a
doubtful starter in a big race, it is pretty safe to back it.
Lord Rosslyn recently announced that It was very un-
certain whether his horse Buccaneer would start for the
City and Suburban, and the public took funk and left his
Lordship the market to himself. The animal did start,
however, and won in a canter. The same thing happened
years ago with Gulnare for the Sydney Cup. Edward
Lee posted her at Tattersalls as a doubtful starter, and
from 3tol in the betting she went to 20’s. She started
and won in a walk.

At a Maryborough (Q.) pigeon-match a few
days ago, a shooter stepped up to his mark, giving the
signal to pull. This being done, and the bird making off,
our sportsman immediately let drive with both barrels.

The N.S.W. Agricultural Society is out with
£2OO trotting handicaps and a consolation handicap of
£5O. The trotting-horse owners have only themselves to
blame, by reason of their hopelessly crooked ways, that
Canterbury, Ilosehill and Moorefield do not often give
them a valuable prize to compete for, and, in view of
bettet things in the future, they should now be on their
best behaviour —Which isn’t up to much, anyhow.
# # #
To discover what trotting record carl be'“put
up ” in Sydney, the writer suggests that the Agricultural
Society should substitute for one of their carnival handi-
caps a substantial prize for any horse trotting a mile in
time the committee may consider worthy of the prize,
each trier to be accompanied, should the owner so desire,
by a galloping mate to make the pace, as practised in
America. If more than one trotter do better than time
specified, the fastest to take the big lump of the plunder.
Such a trial would prove a big draw without a doubt.

The clever division at last made a win with
Myles Standish in the Flying Handicap at Ilosehill. The
public have backed him several times lately, and it is to
be hoped they touched the children of Israel on Saturday.

Tom Hales has not forgotten how to ride. On
Saturday, at Adelaide, he won the City Handicap with
Fortunatus.

On Saturday night, some time after dark, a
boat capsized in Port Phillip Harbour, between Morning-
ton and Mordialloo, and 15 footballers vanished otf the
face of the earth. All the football enthusiasts of Morning-
ton were on board, and now that little township has
hardly a young man left among its population.
It was a foolhardy proceeding to go cruising on
a winter night on an harbour which is really a stormy
inland sea, but the Australian athlete is a reckless in-
dividual, and takes a lot of chances. The disaster is one
of the saddest occurrences in Australian history.

In their long-expected match, Costello (list. 71b. )

reason to believe that this will result in a further exten-

A Day on a Selection.
A Sketch from Observation.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
ThK scene is a small N.S. W. Western selection,
the holder whereof is a native-Englishrnan. His
wife is native-Irish. Time, Sunday, about eight
a.in, A used-up-looking woman comes from the
slab-and-bark house, turns her face towards the
hillside and shrieks :
“ T-o-o-m-may / ”
“No response, and presently she draws a long
breath and screams again :
“ Tom m-a-a-y ! ”
A faint response conies from far up the
“ siding ” where Tommy’s presence is vaguely in-
dicated by half-a-dozen cows moving slowly very
slowly—down towards the cow-yard.
The woman retires ; and ten minutes later she
comes out again and yells i
“ Tommy !! ’’ , ,
“ Y-e-e-a-a-s-s ! ” very passionately and shrilly.
“ Ain’t you goin.’ to bring those cows down to-
day ? ”
“ Ye-e a-s-s-s ! carn’t yer see I’m cornin’ ? ”
A boy is seen torun wildly along the “siding
and hurl a missile at a feeding cow ; the cow runs
forward a short distance through the trees, and
then stops to graze again while the boy stirs up
another milker.
An hour goes by. .
The rising Australian generation is represented
by a thin, lanky youth of about fifteen. He is
milking. Item : The cowyard is next the house,
and is mostly ankle-deep in slush. The boy drives
a dusty, discouraged-looking cow into the bail,
and pins her head there; then he gets tackle on
to her right hind-leg, hauls it back, and makes it
fast to the fence. There are eleven cows, but not
one of them can be milked out of the bail, chiefly
because their teats are sore. The selector does
not know what makes the teats sore, but he has
an unquestioning faith in a certain ointment,
recommended to him by a man who knows less
about cows than he does himself, and which lie
causes to be applied at irregular intervals leaving
the mode of application to the discretion ot his
son. Meanwhile, the teats remain sore.
Having made the. cow fast, the youngster
cautiously takes hold of the least sore teat, yanks
it suddenly, and dodges the cow’s hock, plica
he gets enough milk to dip his dirty hands in, he
moistens the teats, and things go on more
smoothly. Now and then the boy relieves the
monotony of his occupation by squirting at the
eye of a calf which is dozing in the adjacent pen.
Other times he milks into his mouth. Every time
the cow kicks, a burr or a grass-seed or a bit ot
something else falls into the milk, and the buy
drowns these things with a well-directed stream-
on tire principle that what’s out of sight is out ot
mind. . , , . ,
Sometimes the boy sticks his head into the
cow’s side, hangs on by a teat, and dozes,
while the bucket, mechanically gripped between
his knees, sinks lower and lower till it rests on tae
ground. Item : The knees of the youth s trousers
are stiff with misdirected milk. Likely as not
he’ll doze on until his mother’s shrill voice startles
him with an enquiry as to whether he intends to
get that milking done to day; other tunes lie is
roused by the plunging of the cow, or knocked
over by a calf which lias broken through a detec-
tive panel in the pen. In the litter case, the
youth gets tackle on to the calf, detaches its head
from the teat with the heel of his boot, and makes
it fast somewhere. Sometimes the cow breaks, or
loosens the leg-rope and gets her leg into the
bucket, and then the youth clings desperately to
the pail and hopes she’ll get her hoof out again
without spilling the milk. Sometimes she does,
and more times she don't —it depends on the
strength of the boy and the pail, and on the
strategy of the former. Anyway, the boy will
lamb the cow down with a jagged yard-shovel, let
her out, and bail up another.
When he “finishes ” he lets the cows out with
their calves, and carries the milk down to the
“ dairy,” where he has a heated argument with
his mother, who—judging from the quantity of
milk — has reason to believe that he has “ slummed
some of the milkers. This he indignantly denies ;
and he tells her that she knows very well the cows
are going of? milk.
The dairy is built of rotten box-bark—thong 11
there is plenty of good striugybark within easy dis-
tance—and the structure looks as if it wants to lie
down, and is only prevented by three crooked
props on the leaning side ; more props will soon be
needed in the rear, for the dairy shows signs of
going in that direction. r ihe milk is set in dishes
made of kerosene-tins cut in halves, which are
placed on bark-shelves fitted round against the
walls. The shelves are not level, and the
dishes are brought to a comparatively
horizontal position by means of chips and
bits of bark, &c., inserted under the,lower sides.
The milk is covered by soiled sheets of old news-
papers supported on sticks laid across the dishes.
This protection is necessary, because the box bark
in the roof has crumbled away and left fringed
holes ; also, because the fowds roost up there.
Sometimes the paper sags, and the cream has to bo
scraped off an article, perhaps, on “Dairy bann-
ing.'’ , A
The selector’s wife removes the newspapers, and
reveals a thick, yellow layer of rich cream, plenti-
fully peppered with dust that has drifted in some-
how. Siie runs a dirty forefinger round the edges
of the cream to detach it from the tin, wipes her
finger in her month, and skims. It the milk and
cream are very thick, she rolls the cream over like
a pancake with her fingers, and lifts it out in sec-
tions. The thick milk is poured into a slop-bucket,
for the pigs and calves, the dishes are _ cleaned,
and the wife proceeds to set the morning s milk.
Torn holds up the doubtful-looking rag that serves
as a “strainer,” while his mother pours in the
milk. Sometimes the boy’s hand gits tired and he
lets some of the milk run over, and gets into
trouble; but it doesn’t matter much for the
straining-cloth has several sizeable holes in the
The door of the dairy faces the dusty road, and
is off its hinges and has to be propped up. ihe
prop is linissing this morning, and Tommy is
accused of having been seen chasing old 1 oley
with it at an earlier hour. He ‘ never see d the
damn prop; imver chased no cow with it, ana
wants to know “ what’s the use of al ways accnsm
him ” He further complains that he s always
blamed for ev’rythink.” The pole is not forth-
coming, and so an old dray is backed against the
door to keep it in position. There’s more trouble
about a cow that’s “ lost,’’ and hasn t been milked
for two days. The boy takes the cows up to the
paddock slip-rails, lets the top rail down, and
makes" the animals jump the lower one. (ihe
lower rail fits rather tightly and some exertion is
venuired to free it.) . , ,
the selector himself is standing against a fence
talking to a neighbour. The selector’s arms rest
on the top rail of the fence, his chin rests on his
hands, his pipe rests between liis fingers, and his
eyes rest on a white cow that is chewing her cud
on the opposite side of the fence. The neigh-
bour’s arms rest on the top rail also, his chin
rests on his hands, his pipe rests between his
fingers, and his eyes rest on the cow. They are
talking about the cow. They have been talking
about her for three hours. She is chewing her
cud. Her nose is well up and forward, and her
eyes are shut. She lets her lower jaw fall a little,
moves it to one side, lifts it again, and brings it
back into position with a springing kind of a jerk
that has almost a visible recoil. Then her jaws
stay perfectly still for a moment, and you d think
she’d stopped chewing. But she hasn’t. Nowand
again a soft, easy, smooth-going “swallow” passes
visibly along her clean, white throat and dis-
appears; she chews again, and by and-by she
loses consciousness and forgets to chevv. She
never opens her eyes. She is young, and in good
condition ; she has had enough to eat, the sun is
just properly warm for her—and —well if an
animal can be really happy, she ought to be.
Presently the two men drag themselves away
from the fence, fill their pipes, and go to have a
look at some rows of forked sticks, apparently
stpck in the ground for some purpose. The
selector calls these sticks fruit-trees, and he calls
the place “the orchard.” They fool round these
wretched sticks until dinner-time, when the neigh-
bour says he must bo getting home. “Stay and
have some dinner ! Man alive ! Stay and have
some dinner!” says the selector; and so the friend
stays.
It is a broiling hot day in summer, and tho
dinner consists of hot roast meat, hot baked pota-
toes, hot cabbage, hot pumpkin, hot peas, and
burning-hot plum-pudding. The family drinks on
an average four cups of tea each per meal. The
wife takes her place at the head of the table with
a broom to keep the fowls out, and at short
intervals she interrupts the conversation with
such exclamations as “ Shoo ! shoo !” or “ lommy,
can’t you see that fowl? Drive it out !” The
fowls evidently pass a lot of their time in the
house. They mark the circle described by the
broom, and take care to keep two or three inches
beyond it. Every now and then you see a fowl on
the dresser amongst the crockery, and there is
great concern to get it out before it breaks some-
thing. While dinner is in progress two steers get
into the wheat through a broken rail which has
been spliced with stringy bark ; and a calf or two
break into the “ vineyard.” And yet this careless
Australian selector, who is too shiftless to put up
a decent fence, or build a decent house, and who
knows little or nothing about farming, would
seem by his conversation to have made a
study of all the great social and political ques-
tions of the day. But an inch of dialogue
will tell more of character than a column of des-
criptive matter; so we will finish up with some
fragments of conversation caught at the dinner-
table. The characters are—the Selector, the
Missus, the neighbour, Corny George (nicknamed
“Henry George”), Tommy, Jacky, and the
younger children. The spaces represent interrup-
tions by the fowls ami children ;
Corny George (continuing conversation); But
Henry George says, in ‘ Progress- and Poverty,’ he
says ”
Missus (to the fowls); “ Shoo ! Shoo !”
Corny ; “ He says— —” .
Tom ; "Marther, jist speak to this Jack.
Neighbour: “1 think ‘Lookin’ Backwards’ is
more ”
Missus: “Shoo! Shoo! Tom, carn’t you sea
that fowl ?” , ,
Selector: “Now I think ‘ Caesar’s Column is
more likely—— Just look at—" — ”
Missus: “Shoo! Shoo!”
Selector: “Just look at the French Revolu-
tion.” "
Corny ; “Now, Henry George -—”
Tom: “Marther! I seen a old-man kangaroo
up on ”
Missus : “ Shut up ! Carn’t you see someone a
speakin’.”
Selector : “Just look at the French ''
Missus (to the fowls) : “Shoo! Shoo!”
Neighbour : “But ‘Lookin’ Back’ards
Missus : “ There you go, Tom ! Didn t I say
you’d spill that tea? Go away from the table !
Selector: “I think ‘ Ciesar’s Column’ is the
only natural ——”
Missus: “Shoo! Shoo!” She loses patience,
gets up and “fetches” a young rooster with the
flat of the broom, sending him flying into the
yard ; he falls with his head towards the doot and
starts in again. Later on the conversation is
about Deeming.
Selector: “There’s no doubt the man’s
mad ”
Missus: “Deeming! That Windsor wretch !
Why, if I was ia the law I’d have him boiled
alive ! Don’t tell me he didn’t know what he was
doing ! Why, I’d have him ——”
Corny : “ But, Missus, you ”
Missus (to the fowls): “ Shoo ! Shoo !”
HENRY LAWSON.
The Virtue of Vice.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Let me tell you of the virtue of vice. On a
recent autumn afternoon I bent my steps in the
direction of one of the cemeteries of a large Aus-
tralian city. Arrived there, I cursed the enclosure
as a sign of man’s ignorance, for cremation does
not pollute either the soul or the atmosphere.
Entering, I leant against a highly-fretted mansion
of the defunct, and, lighting a cigar, became
absorbed in reverie. Death is the circulation
which prevents all nature from becoming corrupt.
It is a purifier. It is life’s protest against poison.
Methought I saw a snivelling cur about to depart
as his collapsed nervous system refused him the
courage necessary to enable him to view unmoved
his approaching dissolution.
Thus musing, I suddenly noticed the crouching
figure of a woman near a small grave. Unlike
the usual, the mound had not been recently made,
and it was evidently that of a child. The woman
seemed about 30 years of age. She was weeping
bitterly. Presently she plucked a flower from the
bed, with a hasty, nervous movement thrust it
into her bosom, and turned to leave the spot. Her
eyes met mine. She blushed, doubtless ashamed
of her own emotions. Then there came into her
visage the hard, defiant, hunted look of women of
the unfortunate class—she was a prostitute.
This wretched creature’s child had been dead 13
years. For 13 years, in the midst of shame and
degradation, and the most horrible contamination,
to which there was no alternative but death, had
this noble wreck cherished the pure and holy
memory of her infant. Many a proud society
dame could not say half as much. Civilisation
exercises special privileges upon ns, Has the
Divine cohesive essence known as God vanished ?

Gwendolen’s Choice: or, the Earl, the
Girl, and the Australian Native.
A TALE OF TOORAK.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Young Australians, haughty-hearted, members of the
A.N.A.,
Ye whose lips at titles wreathe in a derisive double
curl,
Lend your ears, at least a portion, to this patriotic
lay,
Telling how a Toorak maid preferred a Native to
an Earl.
In the calm Olympic suburb where the gods of
Melbourne dwell.
And the bailiff and time-payment man are
strangers to the dogs,
Stands a building, grand and stately as a Syndicate
Hotel—
Tis thonew Ancestral Mansion of the Family
of Bloggs. J
Lloggs the Elder was a magnate of the highest
loorak typ?,
He owned lucre, lands, and houses to a scan-
dalous degree,
And he consequently thought that for a title he
was ripe,
And he pined to read in print “Sir Thomas
Bloggs, K.C.M.6.”
So lie posed as a Philanthropist upon the Largest
Scale,
And he made, while still in health robust
magnificent bequests
lo all sorts of Institutions, and, in case these arts
should fail,
All Distinguished (titled) Strangers were his
very welcome guests.
Thus it happened that he met with Lord de
Jimmjammes who had come
To Australia (with a keener) to improve his
noble health,
TV hich a tine old fam'ly tendency to breakfast
upon rum
Had considerably shattered—as it had the
fam’ly wealth.
In his house Bloggs kept the nobleman (’twas said
upon a chain)
Bloggs had not been made a knight, and was the
maddest among men,
And had sworn that he’d get near to rank, if rank
he couldn’t gain,
By the marriage of Lord Jimmjammes to his
daughter G wendolen.
But he little knew her spirit when this foolish
oath he swore,
Or that—though she felt some pitv for the
tott ring little Earl—
She had given her heart in keeping, long and long
enough before, h
To a young Australian Native, like a true
Australian Girl.
Shortly after, at a football-match, Lord Jimm-
jammes and the rest
Saw a Young Australian Native-like a hero on
a shield
(With a dislocated shoulder, and a jaw knocked
sou -son’-west),
Or a crate of broken crockery—borne beaming
from the field.
Bloggs the Elder mattered “Serve him right.”
t> , . oa “ beggah !” Jimmjammes sighed ;
-but fair Gwendolen uprising, like a Queen of
-tournament,
Waved her jasmine-scented handkerchief and rap-
turously cried :
He s my Champion, my Chosen-take the Hero
to his tent
-then it came to pass that Bloggs, who knew, as
well as any man,
He could not coerce the feelings of a free Aus-
( trail an girl,
Called a solemn fam’ly pow-wow of the fathers of
the clan
To assess the rival merits of the Native and the
Earl.
* that the latter might appear in proper
Lliey had seized, where he’d been stopping, his
robes and coronet
I'or arrears of board and lodging—he arranged
(you needn’t smile!)
I'or the loan of an Mail’s rig-out from the
lolantho ” set.
So upon the day appointed both the suitors did
appear,
Lord de Jimmjammes looking gaudier than
mortal ought to be,
' * a coronet of tinsel hung on one umbrageous
And a robe of red upholst’ring plush, majestical
to see.
But the young Australian native, far above such
vain display,
Lightly dad in his club costume looked by
JNature’s right a king,
And surveyed the party with a smile both con-
tident and gay,
I hough his dexter eye was darken’d and his jaw
was in a sling.
Then the peer, in accents shaky, a recital weird
began
Of his titles ‘ In old England Earl de Jimm-
jammes and Two Ales, ■
Baron Ballyrot in Ireland, and De Booze in Isle
of Man,
Viscount Toddymore in Scotland, and Lord
Likkerrup in Wales.”
Bloggs and Bloggs’s friends were awe-struck, but,
with smile of stern disdain.
Jimmjammes’ rival listen’d calmly to this Storv
of a Tub,
Then, with simple grandeur said—“My name is
Potter Johnson, plain;
I’m a young Australian Native, and the kicker
of the Club ! ”
There was silence for a moment, then a footman
staggered in
With a nightmare done in metal which, at first,
caused some alarms,
A blue (pewter) devil fighting with a dragon (made
of tin),
“These,” the Earl said with a flourish, “are
the Jimmjammes Fam’ly Arms,
Won in France, by my forefathers, and in many
a wild war-tug
Held in Italy, in ancient days, ’twixt Ghibel-
Ime and Guelph,”
Potter pointed to a trophy—’twas a nickel-plated
mug,
And with brevity sublime said, “Won in Foots-
oray—by my sc!/.”
With a swoop like summer lightning on his dies 6
tell Gwendolen,
He gazed passionately on her with his darken’d
dexter eye—
His emotion was so great he near unshipped his
jaw again;
But old Bloggs said (to the footman), “Take
me out of this to die.”
Then the Earl to the occasion rose, in quite a
splendid strain,
“There are greater things,” he said, “than
mere antiquity, I see,
My delirium tremens dates back into Charles the
second’s reign,
But I d give it, gladly give it, an Australian
born to be.
At a wedding shortly after half of Toorak did
assist,
Twas the Wedding of the Native and his True
Australian Girl—
Bloggs, of course, gave in, and set him up as a
Tobacconist—
If you d like a little wager. . . But you ask
about the Earl ?
Well, he thought to grow a Native by (so Bloggs
himself records)
Walking hatless in the sun, till he was sunstruck,
and in view

The Haunted Lagoon.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Lonely, still, and forsaken,
Sleeps the dark, broad lagoon ;
Save when the stray winds waken
A murmur that dieth soon ;
A whisper amongst the sedges—
A rustle amongst the reeds
That fringe that dark tarn’s edges,
And border the marshy meads.
Once there was life and motion,
Chatter and cry of bird ;
Splashing and loud commotion
As the waters were rocked and stirred.
Bush of the strong-winged widgeon
From its flight o’er hill and dell;
Soft, sweet coo of the pigeon,
Calling as twilight felk
Once, o’er the broad-leaved lilies,
Raced the swift water-fowl,
Now the one sound from the hill is
The hoot of the midnight owl.
The stars watch no wild game drinking
On the shore of that still lagoon ;
Only the wild dog slinking,
Bays at the cold white moon.
Cursed by the victims’ anguish ;
r Cursed by a treach’rous crime ;
The gloomy waters languish
Unheeding the flight of time.
Forests and rocks primeval
Witnessed the sin and pain,
Blighted by deeds so evil,
Blighted they still remain.
Skeleton post and rafter
Show where the shanty stood ;
Ghosts jv ith unholy laughter
I l oop from the neighbouring wood—
Troop rom the graves that cluster
, e edge of the quaking bo^
AU m B !? ir . its tllat nightly muster,
All died there of bocussed grog.
DELCOMYN.
The Pannikin Poet.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
lliere s nothing here sublime,
But just a roving rhyme,
liun off to pass the time,
With nought titanic in
-The theme that it supports,
And, though it treats of quarts,
It’s bare of golden thoughts—
It’s just a pannikin.
I think it’s rather hard
That each Australian bard—
Bach wan, poetic card—
With thoughts galvanic in
His fiery soul alight,
In wild aerial flight,
Will sit him down and write
About a pannikin.
He makes some new-chum faro
I rom out his English lair
lo hunt the native bear,
That curious mannikin ;
And then when times get bad
That wand’ring English lad
Writes out a message sad
Upon his pannikin :
“ Oh, mother, think of me
Beneath the w-attle tree
(For you may bet that he
Will drag the wattle in)
“ Oh, mother, here I think
That I shall have to sink
There ain’t a single drink
The water-bottle in.”
The dingo homeward hies,
The sooty crows uprise
And caw their fierce surprise
A tone Satanic in ;
And bearded bushmen tread
Around the sleeper’s head—
“ See here—the bloke is dead.”
“Now where’s his pannikin.”
They read his words and weep,
And lay him down to sleep
Where wattle-branches sweep
A style mechanic in ;
And, reader, that’s the way
The poets of to-day
Spin out their little lay
About a pannikin.

blemish, and a blood free from the taint of fever and infectious germs. Let

Soap externally.

that holds disease at bay and gives health.

A Song of Southern Writers.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Southern men of letters, vainly seeking recognition
here—
Southern men of letters, driven to the Northern
Hemisphere !
It is time your wrongs were known ; it is time you
claimed redress—
lime that you were independent of the mighty
Northern press,
king a song of Southern writers, sing a song of
Southern fame,
Of the dawn of art and letters and your native
country’s shame.
lalentgoes for little here. To be aided, to bo
known,
You must fly to Northern critics who are juster
than our own.
Oh ! the critics of your country will be very proud
of you,
When you’re recognised in London by an editor or
two.
You may write above the standard, but your work
is seldom seen
Till it’s noticed and reprinted in an English
magazine.
In the land where sport is sacred, where the labTer
is a god,
You must pander to the people, make a hero of a
clod !
What avail the sacrifices of the battles you begin
For the literary honour of the land we’re living in ?
Print a masterpiece in Melbourne, and it will bo
lost, I ween,
But your weakest stuff is clever in a London
magazine.
Write a story of the South, make it true and make
it clear,
Put your soul in every sentence, have the volume
published here,
And ’twill only be accepted by our critics in the
mist
As a “ worthy imitation ” of a Northern novelist.
For the volume needs the mighty Paternoster Row
machine,
With a patronising notice in an English magazine.
What of literary merit, while the Southern reader
glories
In “American exchanges,” with their childish
nigger-stories;
In the jokes that ancient Romans chuckled over
after lunch ;
In tiie dull and starchy humour of the dreary
Loudon Punch?
Here they'll laugh at Southern humour—laugh till
they are out of breath—
When it's stolen from the papers that Australia
starves to death !
Do we ask why native talent—art and music,
cannot stay ?
Why Australian men of letters emigrate and keep
away ?
L>o we ask why genius often vanishes beyond
recall ?
From the wrecks of honest journals comes the
answer to it all.
Over Southern journalism let the epitaph be seen :
“Starved by cheap imported rubbish !—an
Australian Magazine !”
1 * • • • • •
Southern men of letters, seeking kinder fields
across the wave,
Tell a shameful tale entitled “ Deniehy’s For,
gotten Grave.”
Ask the South of Charlie Harpur ! Seek the bitter
truth, and tell
Of the life of Henry Kendall, in the land he loved
so well!
Sing the songs he wrote in vain ! Touch the South
with bitter things;
Take the harp he touched so gently ; show the
blood upon the strings !
It was kind of Southern critics ; it was very brave
to mouth
At the volume of his boyhood, that was published
in the South.
Kendall know it all—he knew it; and the tears
were very near
When he spoke about the sorrows of “The man of
letters here.”
(And his wail of “ Oh, My Brother !” came again
to one who went
To his grave before “his brothers” mocked him
with a monument.)
Banish envy, Southern writer ! Strike with no
uncertain hand.
For the sound of Gordon’s rifle still is ringing
thro’ the land !
Ah ! the niggard recognition ! Ah ! the “fame”
that came in vain
To the poor dead poet lying with a bullet through
his brain !
“Gone, my friends!” (he thought it better to
begone away from here),
Gone, my friends, with “last year’s dead leaves
. . . at the falling of the year.’’
Pleasant land for one who proses, pleasant land
for one who rhymes
With the terrible advantage of a knowledge of
hard times :
To be patronised, “encouraged,” praised for his
contempt of “ pelf,”
To be told of greater writers who were paupers,
like himself-:
To be buried as a pauper ■ to be shoved beneath
the sod—
While the brainless man of muscle has the burial
of a god.
Wo have learned the rights if labour. Let the
Southern writers start
Agitating, too, for letters and for music and for
art,
Till Australian scenes on canvas shall repay the
artist's hand,
And the songs of Southern poets shall be rinsing'
thro’ the land,
lill the galleries of Europe have a place for
Southern scenes,
And our journals crawl no longer to the Northern
magazines.

Some time ago, writes a London corres-

of happy memory, who thus officiated at the
4 turning-off ” not jilone of his old chums in
N.S.W., but assisted at most of the weddings of
the Melbourne Clubmen who cut the joys of single
blessedness. The writer of this once said to him :
“ Why don’t you try matrimony yourself, Eb. !.”
(he was always “Eb.”tohis schoolmates). “You
see, old man,” said the genial one, “ I visit a good
deal amongst ’em after they are spliced, and I
think it’s best not. I’m all right as it is.”
