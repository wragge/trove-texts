THE RED PAGE
Recommended
As Home Affairs are demanding more
space (and this page resembles the bed of
Procrustes in one respect), it is proposed to
take it out of Foreign Affairs, Hence-
forward, novels, etc., which are approved
but do not call for extended notice, will be
mentioned in a list at the head of this page.
A formal acknowledgment to publishers of
books about which nothing can be said is of
little value to them or anyone else. They
are advised to send only literature of general
interest.
Hope —R. Cunninghame Graham (Duckworth).
Short stories and sketches in a glowing and
distinguished style.
The Exception —Oliver Onions (Methuen). Onions
is a realist with a light touch and a quizzical
view of life. Those who admired Little
Devil Doubt (the rule amongst the elect) will
like The Exception.
Uncle Polperro—A. Oourlander (Dymock’s). An
amusing frivolity.
Let the Roof Fall In— Frank Danby (Lockley
Library). A strong, attractive novel with
some fine Irish and a ripping Jew ; scenes in
London and Siam ; humor and pathos.
The Return —Walter de la Mare (Arnold). De la
Mare, a poet of sorts, handles a weird theme
exceedingly well. The principal character is
invaded by a strange spirit, and loses his
original identity. The natural and super-
natural elements are developed side by side.
It belongs to the same class of fiction as
Algernon Blackwood’s work, and is finer than
The Glimpse or The Other Side.
The Hycena of Kallu —Louise Gerard (Dymock’s).
The author of The Golden Centipede gives
another version of the tragedy of the half-
caste, with the thrilling adventures and
mysterious gloom of West African settlements
thrown in.
Wine, Women and Roses
When rosebuds into chalices unroll
For love of wine Narcissus bears the bowl.
Ah ! happy he who learns the crimson lore,
And, wine’s own Sfifi, liberates his soul.
Of that old wine some vanished Sultan grew,
Give me, that I may paint life’s scenes anew.
01), make me heedless of the heedless world
That I may sing the world’s desire to you.
Gome, love and wine beside the river’s brink ;
In every cup some shallow care we’ll sink.
Life’s span is but the rose’s, ten dear days ;
Then chain the ten with laughter’s golden link.
O lovers, you whose happy hands enlace,
For whom Time’s wheel, forgotten, flies apace.
When my time eometh hail the endless round
That other Aprils may recall my face.
* * * *
The little volumes published by John
Murray in “The Wisdom of the East”
series have already introduced to English
readers much of the literature of Asia. We
have had “ The Master Singers of Japan,”
“The Lute of Jade” from China, a good
deal of the wisdom of India and some qjf the
poetry of Persia—“ The Rose Garden of
Sa’di,” translated by Oranmer-Byng, “The
Diwan of Abu’l-ala ” done into excellent
English verse by Henry Baerlin, who has
also provided an essay on Arabian poetry,
called “The Singing Caravan.” All that one
needs of Jami has been given elsewhere by
Fitzgerald, whose version of Omar Khayyam
has become part of English literature.
But the greatest of all Persian poets,
Hafiz, has not had the luck to meet a Fitz-
gerald, and in consequence he is little more
than a name to us. Professor Cowell, who
knew him better than most moderns, was not a
vei-se-maker, and Emerson translated only a
few verses (and these from a German trans-
lation) to illustrate his essay on Persian
poetry. LeGallienne, of course, does not
count.
The austere Emerson, who shot an arrow
of prophecy into the dark with regard to
“Omar Chiam,” had a fine appreciation of
the luxuriant genius of the prince of Persian
poets, and, mystic though he was, said he
did not wish “to strew sugar on bottled
spiders or try to make mystical divinity out
of the Song of Solomon, much less out of the
erotic and bacchanalian songs of Hafiz.” It
is related that, not long after the poet’s
death, his works were condemned as un-
orthodox. The Srifi, who tried the matter,
decided (“O wise judge!”)—“that every-
one was at liberty to use his own judgment
as to the meaning to be assigned to the poems
of Hafiz.”
You may, therefore, take the wine neat or
regard it as “ the love of God,” and women
as the real thing or angels, or whatever else
may please your fancy. Hafiz, at any rate,
was violently in love with a damsel named
Branch of Candy, and when his wife left
him in a temper his passionate verses in-
duced her return. Of her he said :
If the scent of her hair were to blow across my
dust when I have been dead a hundred years, my
mouldering bones would rise and come dancing
out of the tomb.
But then the imagery of Persian poets is
always slightly exaggerated. The same
gentle Hafiz wrote of the Shah, a minor
poet who had put his father’s eyes out:
May the ball of the heavens be forever in the
crook of thy polo stick, and the whole world be a
playing ground unto thee. The fame of thy
goodness has attained to the four quarters of the
earth ; may it be for all time a guardian unto
thee.
These and other interesting matters relating
to Hafiz may be found in The Ruhaixjdt of
Hafiz (Murray), sold for Is. net. It is the
first instalment of the complete poems, trans-
lated literally by Syed Abdul Majid, and
turned into English verse by L. Cranmer-
Byng. The specimen quatrains printed be-
low and above will show that, though far
short of Fitzgerald’s “ Omar,” it is a worthy
successor to Baerlin’s “ Abu’l-ala.”
* * * *
Whence did the tangles of your hair arise?
And the dreams that haunt the shadows of your
eyes?
Since none have shaken petals on your path,
Oh, whence the attar that around you lies?
The jasmine blooms in the shadow of your hair?
Lips beyond price, since Aden’s pearls lie there,
Like you, the soul is ever wine-inspired ;
The wine’s bright soul shines through a form as
fair.
Roselit, my tears like her twin roses show
My heart’s red blood through aching eyes doth
flow.
She asked me, seeking for a fair reply :
“Why do thine eyes like lakes in twilight
glow? ”
O great of soul ! How gladly would I give
All that I am to thee by whom 1 live!
If thou wouldst know the bitterness of hell,
Pour friendship’s water through an empty sieve.
A Hew inferno?
Hafiz naturally brought up memories of
Omar, and one quatrain of the Rubaiyrit was
floating in “ the hinterland of the brain ”
(see H. G. Wells) when we read The New
Inferno of Stephen Phillips, in which,
according to the advertisement, the poet
strikes his early form again.
It is an Inferno in nine cantos of blank
verse, wherein the poet:
Dreaming in starless night, it seemed that I,
Lifted in spirit arms, was outward borne,
Beyond the steadfast boundaries of the earth
And the invisible orb of the vast sun.
Then was I ’ware that one beside me was,
Whom I felt speaking rather than heard speak :
“ One whom thou lovest and who still loves thee
Despatched me to thy side,” the spirit said.
He is advised by the spirit to get rid of the
old idea “that, after bodily death, the
trembling spirit is haled before its Maker
and its J udge and, if its deeds were evil,
sentenced straight.” He meets the Corsican
alone ujfbn a frozen Alp
Roofed by the purple vault of his own mind,
And glassed upon a glacier of the soul.
Then Josephine arrives, after wandering “in
felicity of woe ” (Tom Moore had it “luxury
of woe”), and the icy brow grew soft and
flowers sprang up from the glacier at his feet.
The other souls they met are not of his-
toric importance. One “colorless, pale soul,”
like Tomlinson’s, could not get a place even
with the “ gentlemen, three on a grid.” One
who had been a Grand Inquisitor was writh-
ing in a raging fire made of “the flame
awaked by the still living fury of the dead.”
(That is very much like the Inquisitor’s own
idea of Hell. It would have been more fun
if they had fed the old chap with never-
ending spoonsful of ice cream.) Another
person had been standing motionless for
two centuries enjoying the torture of one
who had stolen his wife ori earth—and so on.
Altogether, Phillips’ Hell is a very small
Hell. The architecture is, on the whole,
good. The report that the poet hjis been in
bad health may account for a number of weak
lines and imagery borrowed from himself
and elsewhere.
At the end the spirit recapitulates the
chief incidents of the trip and says :
This much at least thou canst discern and tell:
That hate, on earth begotten, here is hate;
That vengeance there conceived consumes us
here;
That here the soul lives as on earth it lived.
That the discarding of the body of the Earth
Sends not to sudden pain or sudden joy,
But the loosed spirit the lone journey takes
Perhaps for seons to work out its fate.
That is to say, Phillips, in 350 stanzas, tells
what Fitz-Omar put into one :
I sent my soul through the Invisible
Some letter of that After-life to spell;
And by and by my soul return’d to me
And answer’d “ I myself am Heav’n and Hell.”
Dick Harris
Monodies: A Booh of Verse, printed in a
limited edition by Whitcombe and 'Tombs
Ltd. (M.L.), is evidently the work of a
young man, for most of the contents are
grey and sad. Yet from a writer who prints
his name as “Dick Harris” one wlould
expect more spirited verse than “ Crepus-
cule,” “Lavender,” “After Grief,” “La-
ment,” etc., in which faded threads from old
tapestries are woven into new patterns—
woven dexterously enough, as will be seen
in these pieces :
Life is one long regret
For summers fled—for beauty passed away.
What tears there are in songs that once were gay !
The sad heart, dreaming yet—
Sighs the one plaintive fret. . .
Life is one long regret
For yesterday.
The air seems stirred with a calling of fairy bells,
And chanting a tender, tremulous lullaby,
The wimpling creek through a tangle of bush-
wrack wells.
See, how there in the west.
Unstirred by the ghost of a breeze,
That little band of strong and stately trees
In meditation with a hushed delight,
Stands tall and dark against the day’s last light;
An etching of woven branches over the sky—
A wistfully luminous screen
Of rose intermingled with saffron
Fading to green.
There are few faults to be found with the
construction; but a temporarily defective
ear passed this line :
The joyous harbor, seen ’tween stem and leaf.
In “Singing Youth” the writer tells us
that—
When eighteen years had found me
And left me worn with time,
And wan years wrapped around me
Grey eld of frost and rime. . . .
But now, at two and twenty;
I sing a better song;
For I have years in plenty
To love and laugh along.
So there is hope of more cheerful work from
one who certainly knows how to manipulate
the materials of minor poetry. Dick Harris,
in this little book, looks like the beginnings
of another Victor Daley, and for such as he
there is always a welcome from poetry-
lovers in Australia.
The Last of the Mirandelays
Acknowledgment; should have been made
earlier of Mirandelays from P. 8., “Tahune,”
P- A. McC., “The Blot,” “Poi-Poi,” J.M.,
A.T.R. and A.H.
“Alpenstock” sends a variation of
O’Dowd’s form, in which the first stanza
advances, the 2nd, 4th, 6th, Bth and 10th
reverse—each holding on to the first stanza
by a line, and finally the first stanza stands
on its head. As this is pretty near the
limit in whirling verse, forms it may (in a
punctured state) fittingly close the busiriess.
Directions are added for re-inflation, if
required.
A QUANDARY.
Who of all these maidens is the maid for me ?
[Here follow the five lines in italic below.]
Proud and peerless Florence of one week in May.
Swayed she in the sunlight as we rode along,
Cold and soft her voice seemed, tremulous
her hand,
Pale and glowing Florence, did you under-
stand ?
Weak, pathetic Florence, and my Florence
strong,
Did you understand it—why I rode away ?
[Reverse last six lines.]
Gwyndoline, whose breathings hypnotise the air:
Floats about her magic like an element ;
Potent are her glances, potent to compel
Love that trembles greatly else to hide or tell;
All the east its wonder unto her has lent
Maid of inspiration, magic and despair.
[Reverse last six lines.]
Cynthia, adorable her movements and her hair ;
Grace itself encaptured in a woman’s frame ;
Beauty in thesunlight playing hide and seek
In the hair that’s wafted over neck and cheek ;
Sweet her subtle graces, Sweeter than her name,
Dearer than the dearest, fairer than the fair.
[Reverse last six lines.]
Eunice of the sea beach and the holiday.
Sweet those summer evenings on the old cart
track ;
Scent of full-blown flowers on the air around.
Grasses lush and seeding on the gracious
ground.
Oft we’ve wandered nowhere, and the long way
back
Pacing in the glamor of the starry ray.
[Reverse last six lines.]
Phyllis, my beloved, beautiful is she,
Classical her name is, classical her eyes
And her voice is gentle, gentle as the dove,
She must be beholden ere you know of love,
Complex is her nature, simple, pure and wise,
She fulfils the promise of the things to be.
[Reverse last six lines.]
[Reverse lines in italic.]

The Odd Volume
The latest number of this miscellany in
prose, verse and pictures is better than its
predecessors, especially in the verse depart-
ment. This and Printer's Pie are published
in aid of English book-trade charities. Both
are sold in large numbers every year, mainly
on the strength of their pictures and amusing
trifles by well-known writers.
Why not an Australian Odd Volume to
provide the nucleus of a fund for the benefit
of writers and artists who have fallen on
the Inky Way ? It is worth considering by
the guilds of the craft.
Mendelssohn’s South African Bibliography—a
eonpiete list of books, pamphlets, periodicals,
etc, relating to South Africa, with biographical
and critical notes —is about to be published in
London by Kegan, Paul and Co. It will be of
immense value to all students of South African
life aid literature. A similar Bibliography of
printer, matter relating to Australia is badly
needed. Maoriland was fortunate in having Dr.
Hocken, a book-lover with leisure, who completed
and published a Bibliography of literature relat-
ing to the Dominion just before he died. There
is a man aere—E. A. Petherick—who could do
the same w»rk for Australia. Some years ago he
printed pari of a Catalogue Raisonni of his own
collection of Australians—which has since been
tc the Commonwealth Government.
If E. A. Petlurick undertakes a complete Aus-
tralian Bibliography, it will be well done, and his
name will he bletsed by many people.
Most working journalists know the value of
Johns’ Notable Australians, and will welcome his
projected volume, in which all dead Australians
who did anything notable will be preserved in
amber.
Another book of reference urgently wanted is
Henniker Heaton’s Australian Dictionary of Dates,
revised and brought down from 1579 to the present
time. It requires a man with nous, and wquld
mean a lot of patient labor. It is a chance of ira-
mortality for some one.

The second or third story entitled The Heart
of the Bush, is by Edith S. Grossman (G. Robert-
son and Co.), and tells how a rough and handsome
bushnian carries off a refined and beautiful girl to
live'in the Maoriland bush—after the wedding,
of course. Some chapters explain that he
neglected hjs Adelaide for his flocks and herds and
the Frozen Meat industry. In the last chapter
we learn “ How Dennis came back to Adelaide,
and of the joy they had, and how true love is
likened to Spring.”

Horace Danby: Adventurer, by Capt. H. W.
Platts (Whitcombe and Tombs, Ltd.). Awld
adventure yarn with explosions, robblry,
butchery, sudden death and the ’Frisco eilth-
quake. It goes well enough if you don’t |op
to think of the impossible human beings, f
The Mystery of the Boxing Contest, by “Bert
James” (Bookstall Co.). A good specjien
of its class—the third-rate detective storj
Under the Street Lamp, by Jonathan Hpvke
(Kelly, London). The writer, a Metbtdist
minister in S. A., presents the kindlier side of
Australian bush and city life in sketcheiand
stories wherein the sentiment and fidelitj are
more to be admired than the style.

landmarks of old Paris are describe 1 pleas-

As is appropriate, the illustrations arfvague

THE DIPSOMANIAC AND THE
BLUE HORSE.
One two-o’clock in the morning f dipso-
maniac walking in the country of dippmania
perceived a blue horse making faceslit him
through a hole in a wall. Fasciifted by
their hideousness and the magniticenjelectric
blue color of the horse, the dijisomaniac
glued his face to the hole and Ijlird the
colorsome equine talking to itself | a voice
like a creaking axle.
“Oh, Satan ! my best beloved njfeter,” it
groaned, “ why dost thou allow idy image,
emblazoned in glory upon whisky jttles, to
be spat upon by loiterers in tfjs bottle
cemetery. When the bottles are full of
golden juice, man calls me his gffeat blue
god, and faints with the ecstasy of my
unparalleled magnificence, but ” ——
“ Vain rascal ! ” exclaimed the dipso-)
maniac, able to contain himself no longer ;
“’tis not thy beauty which causes me to
faint, ’tis the rare juice in the bottle.”
Whereupon the blue horse flashed through
the hole in the wall and cantered round and*
round the man’s head in concentric circles of
vivid electric blue, and whistled in his ear.
“Splendid!” exclaimed the man when
the blue horse had finished kaleidoscoping.
“Thou art indeed a most accomplished and
well-favored horse, and if thou wilt but
consent to be mine, there is no racecourse
in the world but will acclaim us twain ‘the
supernatural duo;’” arid, taking a halter from;
his oilskin pocket, the man thrust a bunch
of Maori land spinach through the hole ini
the wall and waited for the blue horse to
become his. It was not to be expected,,
however, that a horse of such an excellent
complexion was to be beguiled by a ruse so:
transparent and obsolete; and, galloping
madly through the man’s brain, it was back
in Satan’s stable even before his head had
crashed upon the macadam.
Thus it is that the rarest specimens and
messages from eternity are perpetually being!
frightened away by the rude and clumsy.

A Clergyman’s Testimony to Clements Tonic .
REV. J. WILLIAMS.
CLEMENTS TONIC LTD .
A MINISTERING MEDICINE.
FOR ELEVEN YEARS PASTOR
of the Wooloongabba Congregational Church, Bris-
bane, and Principal of the | Theological School
founded therewith, the Rev. John Williams, a strong
intellectual thinker, and a fine and forceful preacher,
well remembered in Brisbane for his splendid edu-
cational sermons and lectures, jwrites the following
letter to the merits of a great! medicine which is
creating unquestionable cures of Nervous Breakdown,
Insomnia, Weakness, Brain-Fag, and Stomach and
Liver Ailments. Business men and women in ill-
health should read this letter, especially if they wish
to regain health and strength, and enjoy life as only
healthy people can :
“Clements Tonic Cured Me.”
“ Prompted by a spirit of gratitude, I write to let you know that Clements
Tonic did for me what I have learnt it has done so effectively for others. I
suffered from nervous breakdown, consequent upon the strain of over-work,
and was for a time at quite a loss to find an effective recuperative. Happily
my choice fell on Clements Tonic, which restored me to my wonted self with
surprising speed and surety. When I have felt the same condition of nerves
arising, I have promptly checked it by a tiihely use of the remedy. Above
all, I find it induces a natural, refreshing sleep, wherein Nature has oppor-
tunity to work her cures in her own way ; and what could be better said of
a remedy than that ? I am, yours faithfully,
REV. J. WILLIAMS.”
Every week lettersjn praise of the health-creating properties of this great medicine, Clements Tonic,
are given to the proprietors. They come from ail States of the Commonwealth. Those persons who are
afflicted with impaireddigestion, nervous breakdown, or debility, constipation, weakness, lassitude, low
spirits, biliousness, sick headache, liver or kidney irregularity, should obtain Clements Tonic and health
atTthe same time. This letter proves this can be done. People who are ill, sickly, weak-nerved; with
strength, vigor, energy undermined, or who cannot get strong after long or sudden illnesses or attacks
of fever, etc., should read the tributes to this great medicine, and send for it without delay. A 1 J
Chemists and Stores sell it everywhere in Australia, so that the sick person may obtain it.

The Closed Gates.
The Gates of Paradise (the Persians say)
That shine beyond this narrow vale of tears,
But once unfold and leave an open way
In all the cycle of a thousand years.
The Gates of Torment (crieV^. later creed),
That man may purge him duly of his crime.
And wash away the stains of evil deed,
Stand open for his entry all the time.
In troubled mood comes then the modern sage,
And, torn in twain by dubious faiths of yore,
He turns his back on creeds of either age
And shuts the Rival Gates for evermore !

F. BORN.
The Men Whose Cake is Dough.
VICTORIA.
Their firstfruits all are perished,
' Their shewbread is dust;
The highest hope they cherished
Betrayed them to distrust ;
Once eager for the highroad.
With lame feet and slow,
They march by any by-road,
The men whose cake is dough.
In sunshine they departed,
With hearts that beat high ;
Tiie road whereon they started
Swept grandly to the sky ;
A gallant song they chanted
Of Fate’s overthrow.
Who now march dumb and daunted,
The men whose cake is dough.
Their failure cannot 'blind them
To pathways they planned ;
They know what lies behind them,
What royal rainbows spanned
The sky that bene above them
When youth was aglow,
And Heaven seemed to love them —
The men whose pake is dough.
The songs that they were cheered by—
A heart-stirring host —
The pinnacles they steered bv ;
The guiding stars they lost;
A woman’s charm of laughter,
A spell soft and low—
These phantoms follow after
The men whose cake is dough.
The psean of their inspiring
Is silent for them ;
Of earthly music tiring
They wait their requiem ;
They journey on grey-hearted
Till God bids them go.
And Heaven addeth leaven
To the cakes that were dough.
KETTLEDRUM.
Nuit Blanche.
From burdened clouds that blur the starlight’s
gleam '
The teardrops start;
I turn to seek the chamber of my dream
With hopeless heart.
Even as lightning stabs the tortured sky.
My heart is pierced by spearS <pf memory ;
Though kindly rain may sheath the lightning’s
spears, ' <
No peace is mine, who dare not pray for tears.
But here at least is shelter from the storm,
If I but win
White nights to watch beside the fancied form
That dwells within—
My soul’s remembrance of a hope divine,
Vivid and sweet and proud, but never mine.
My love were all unmeet her heart to stir,
Whose God dreamed girlhood, woke and fashioned
her.
Here sleeps Joyeuse, my rose upon her breast;
So light she lies,
Meseems I dare not gaze upon her, lest
She ope her eyes ;
As this dead rose, if sentient of the sun
Might crave its kisses, till their warmth had Won
Glory and beauty back, that none might guess
Its journey into night and nothingness.
By her deep eyes what spell might not be laid
Of flawless youth,
To mock the march of time that makes afraid
And prove it truth
That all the threats of all the years were vain,
While love lived on to end love’s golden reign ?
The dream died with its day—and dare I rue'
Departure of the dream who dreamed it through ?
Yet the faint echo of a distant bell
Sounding at eve,
As if to bid our day serene farewell,
Still makes believe
That peace is in the night it seems to call.
Were there no night how learn that stars must
fall?
What though the dusk be full of bitterness ?
I lived my day—l would not ask for.less.
Though mute the music, not in vain the quest
Of one whose eyes
Follow the homing songster to the nest,
Where singing dies;
So sang Joyeuse a song that seemed a prayer,
And, having sung, went wistfully to share
A sweeter silence. . . . Though the night be long,
Once it was day—and once I heard her song.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Thk Bullktin would oblige the paver
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
bid to the Manager. 'To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bullktin,” is the proper
superscription for "copy." Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.
Special Notice.

THE INEFFICIENT FIRST LINE OF
DEFENCE.
A pew days ago the Australian Government pub-
lished a return showing the imports of the Com-
monwealth for the ten months to October 31, 1910.
They amounted to £48,875,080, an increase of
£7,529,086 as compared with the corresponding
period of 1909. At this rate, it appears that the
total imports for the year will reach fully
£57,000,000. The biggest item, and also the
biggest increase, appeared under the heading of
“apparel and all descriptions of softgoods,” and,
while most of the items are a disgrace to Aus-
tralian industry, this one is especially disgrace-
ful. Australia supplies, or is able to supply, all
the raw material for the making of softgoods. It
is the world’s greatest source of wool furnish-
ment; it has splendid cotton lands; it has as
good an opportunity for the production of silk as
the next place; it has bullock-hide enough to
make boots and other leather goods for half the
world ; and as for rabbits, regarded as a material
out of which hats can be made—well, it seems to
own three-fourths of the world’s rabbit supply, or
perhaps a little more. In fact, its imports of
softgoods consist largely in buying back its own
products at vastly increased prices, this country
being the Gibeonite that does the rough and
simple work of dragging things off the earth,
while the more cultured foreigner attends
to the finer and more costly and better-
paid sections of the. business. The imports of
machinery and metal goods in general also
help to remind this backward land that it has
great iron deposits of its own, though so far they
have done it little good. In fact, the whole long
list is a dreary reflection upon our inefficient tariff
and the inefficient makers thereof. A second re-
vision—a revision which will add many new
duties to the list and increase many old ones,
some by as much as 400 percent. —is already some
years overdue.
**• * *
Just now, when Australia is taking its defence
question a little more seriously than of yore, it is
a good time to consider how much lost defence
these imports represent. It may be assumed that
£5O a year is a fair average income, on which basis
the average earnings of a married man with four
children would be £3OO. At that rate the imports
of 1910 ought to represent 1,140,000 extra people
—the 1,140,000 people that are not here—the
1.140,000 inhabitants who don’t inhabit—the
1,140,000 folk that we might have but whom
we haven’t. That is to say, they represent
that number in the first place; but when there is
added (1) the number of extra agriculturists, shop-
keepers and workers of a thousand different
varieties, including archbishops and policemen, to
whom these 1,140,000 new artisans and their fami-
lies would give employment; (2) the additional
number of artisans whom these agriculturists,
shopkeepers, archbishops and policemen would
employ ; (3) the further lot of agriculturists, shop-
keepers, archbishops and policemen that this new
lot of artisans would employ ; (4) the further lot
of artisans they would employ ; (5) and so on to
the end of the chapter—when all these are added
it looks possible enough that Australia’simporting
disease and its inefficient tariff stand for an im-
mediate loss of 2,000,000 inhabitants, with a much
larger one in the future. And 2,000,000 people
stand for a mighty lot of defence.
* * * *
In the matter of national Protection a high
tariff represents a lot more than even these figures
would indicate. Defence nowadays doesn’t simply
consist in a hairy creature tearing a branch off a
tree and going to the front with the thin end of
it in his hand and the thick end in the air. It
employs men of every trade, barring jewellers
and variety showmen and a few more. The
country that becomes involved in a great
war wants to be able to abundantly supply
itself not only with food but with rifles,
bayonets, swords, cartridges, cannon, steel rails,
locomotives, carriages, signalling apparatus, tele-
graph wire, insulators, iron bridges, ships, aero-
planes, balloons, wool, cotton, linen, clothes,
boots, hats, surgical instruments, bikes, motor-
cars, paper, machinery of all sorts to keep up the
supply of goods, and many other things—that is
to say, it wants to be able to do all this if it is an
island state which is liable to be cut off from the
outer world. A country like Germany may afford
to take risks—though Germany doesn’t—in the
matter of depending on imports in war time, for
it has seven land frontiers, and its foreign supplies
couldn’t be wholly cut off unless it was beaten at
sea and had simultaneously got into conflict with
Russia, Austria, Switzerland, France, Holland,
Belgium and Denmark. Australia hasn’t one
land frontier ; to lose the command of the sea
would mean the practical stoppage of all supplies
except such as might be smuggled in. And con-
sidering the distances, the risks and the losses, these
would be few and very costly. In days of war and
deficient sea power it wouldn’t do Australia, as-
suming that it had the importing habit badly, one
penn’orth of good even it had 70,000,000 bushels
of surplus wheat to sell, and an Alp of frozen
meat, and 10 square leagues of dead rabbit, and a
cubic mile of hide, and all the rest of the pro-
ducts of its “great natural resources.” It
wouldn’t be able to get them to any foreign
market. They wouldn’t buy it even a pound of
cement, or a yard of cloth, or a rifle from abroad,
nor would they save it from insolvency for a
moment. Australia’s position would be many
times worse than that of the non-manufacturing
Southern States in the U.S. civil war, for they
had at least the friendly frontier of Mexico as an
outlet for their cotton and an inlet for their sup-
plies. A big and thoroughly effective tariff is to
Australia an army and a navy and a military and
naval reserve, an all-round entrenchment, a shore
fortification and an inland fortification —in fact, it
is one-half the battle and probably a good deal of
the other half. And these £57,000,000 of im-
ports are just the measure of Australia’s unpre-
paredness for the battle.
* * * *
The Freetrader, who is mostly an importer, and
the Freetrade paper, which makes its biggest
profit out of the importer’s advertisements, still
stick to the old lie that Freetrade and abundance
of importation and no local manufactures spell
cheapness. They have to do that because to the
importer local manufacture is extinction. The
local maker —of whom such Sydney furniture-
building firms as Hordern, Foy, and Beard
Watson and Co. are specimens—get into the
habit of dealing direct with the private buyer, and
that cheeky, useless, exorbitant middleman who
makes money by shoving his carcase in between
the foreign manufacturer and the Australian con-
sumer finds himself compelled to go and get work.
But local industry, when it gets fairly on its feet,
does a lot more than save the importer’s profits,
and supply the country with a vast extra reserve
of men for defence purposes, and insure the
country against being beaten almost without an
effort in war time through inability to obtain
munitions. It supplies new taxpayers and cus-
tomers for the postal, railway and other services.
Roughly speaking, one-fifth of everybody’s earn-
ings goes to the public treasury in one
shape or another. Therefore, the man who pays
£5 for a locally-made article knows that
some 20s. of it goes to lighten' his own public
burdens, consequently it is 12 pence cheaper to
buy a local article at £5 than an imported one at
£4 Is. And local industry reduces the public
debt; if by making our own goods under a heavily
Protective tariff we can employ and maintain
6,000,000 people instead of 4,000,000, then the
debt that was formerly £6O per head becomes only
£4O. On top of these things, all the evidence
goes to show that, as soon as local industries are
well established, prices go down—though even if
they didn’t the case for Freetrade would be just
as hopeless as it is now. It is cheaper in immedi-
ate cash to have no army than to have an army ; it
costs less on paper to do without a navy than to
possess one ; there is a large apparent saving in
disbanding the police force; and there is economy
in suicide, because it saves the cost of clothes,
boots, hats, food, rent, taxes, drinks, etc., etc.
But most people feel that these savings are a dead
loss in the end. And it is just as dead a loss to
save money—if money can be so saved—by leaving
the country without the means of supplying itself
in war time with the thousand and one things
that are as essential to defence as the army itself.
An isolated land which doesn’t manufacture all it
urgently requires may, in one war,, have the ex-
traordinary luck to be able to keep on importing
its goods, just as a country without defences
of its own may, for once, have the amazing good
fortune to import a borrowed army and navy.
But these things don’t often happen even once,
and they hardly ever happen twice.
Therefore the great increase in imports consti-
tutes a message to Australia that its chief defence
is rotten —that its biggest gun is cracked—that its
principal Dreadnought has neither bottom nor
sides, and not even very much top. And the de-
mand for repairs is loud and very urgent.
THE RISE IN FOOD PRICES.
The statement that the price of food has gone up
has become so frequent as to be a mere common-
place. Some theorists ascribe the rise to the
enormous increase in the supply of gold during
the last6oyears or thereabouts. Australia alone has
turned out, since 1850, more gold than the world’s
entire visible stock then consisted of, despite the
fact that that old stock included all the glories of
Ophir and Pactolus, and the loot of Spanish
America, and the plunder of Solomon’s temple
and other sundries. The proposition is that gold
has become cheap through superabundance,
so that a sovereign isn’t worth so many loaves as
it used to be, though the great saving that has
been effected in the cost of carrying the loaf from
place to place has partly counteracted this
upward movement. Bi-metallists profess a com-
plicated theory to the effect that the use of two
monetary standards instead of one would reduce
prices. Freetraders have a quaint conceit that the
abolition of customs duties would have the same
effect, though in what way the abolition of cus-
toms duties would increase the world’s food supply
it is difficult to tell. One certainty of the case is
that the rise in food prices is an exceedingly good
thing for a country like Australia, which has a
surplus of wheat and beef to sell; it
grows enough food for its own use whether a
bushel of wheat fetches 2s. 6d. or 55., but at ss. it
gets a great deal more cash in return for its sur-
plus, and it is encouraged to grow a much larger
surplus. On the other hand, a rise in prices is a
dead loss to countries, like England, which import
most of their food ; they have to make more car-
pets or calico or woollen or hardware with which
to purchase their daily bread, and there is no
countervailing advantage whatsoever. Conse-
quently, England, from its point of view, wails
.about high food prices, and the local Freetrade
press, which is merely an echo of British opinion,
often forgets that our point of view is quite
different, and wails also.
* -K *
Amid the many alleged causes of high food
prices there is one which looks solid and reliable,
and which suggests that the rise is going to be
permanent and to extend further. The number
of countries with a surplus of food for export is
steadily decreasing, and the number of countries
which want to buy food from abroad is on the
rise. There are very old people still living who
were born in the days when Britain often grew
more wheat than it required for its own
use; now it only grows about enough to meet
one-sixth of its demand. Austria-Hungary has
just got off the list of exporting countries
and become an importing one. Belgium, Den-
mark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan,
Holland, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and Turkey
are all grain-importing countries, and the most
of them have also reached that stage within
the lifetime of people who are not yet dead
or even old. Russia is almost the only European
country remaining that has a surplus of food, and
its surplus is a diminishing quantity ; in an em-
pire which has added 95,000,01)0 to its population
m 73 years, such a movement is inevitable. The
United States, by reason of its vast increase of
people, shows plain and visible signs of an inten-
tion to retire from its aged job as the world’s
granary. Then every country which leaves
the food-export business and becomes an importer
takes, in a sense, another country along with it.
For instance, 16 years ago Austria-Hungary and
Servia both had surplus grain to sell cheaply to
Britain, the chief buyer; but now Austria-Hungary
has a shortage, and is capable, in consequence, of
eating the surplus of Servia; and thus, in one act,
two sellers have ceased to clamor on Bull’s door-
step asking him if he wants some low-priced food
to put on his free breakfast-table. There are con-
stantly more buyers’ doorsteps to clamor on and
fewer sellers to clamor on all these doorsteps, and
in consequence there are signs that in a very few
years a balance that has remained fairly steady
ever since the records of commerce began will shift
considerably.
* * * *
Hitherto, it has almost invariably been the rich
country that bought food and the hard-up one
that sold it. The purchasing nation was the
affluent Lazarus catching the provender that fell
from the poor man’s table. But if, with the in-
crease in the number of food-buying countries and
the decrease in the number of selling ones, prices
keep going up, the situation must needs vary.
Capital will begin to move from old, densely-
occupied countries to new, thinly-peopled ones; it
will move in payment for the exorbitant
loaf and the chop that is as refined
gold. The world’s financial centres will tend
to change from old London and Berlin and
Paris into Canada, Argentina, Siberia and Aus-
tralia. Gradually a cold day will set in for the
rich States which can’t feed themselves, for the
other States will feed themselves first, even if
they have to legislate in order to prevent the ex-
port of an undue proportion of food, and the
wildly affluent foreigu buyer will get the rest —
the diminishing rest; and the less there is of it
the more he will pay for it. This condition of
affairs will induce an extra rush of population to
the great wheat-growing countries, and they will
want it badly, for, as the price of food increases,
the ground value of the States which have still
space on which to raise a great abundance of
the article will boom tremendously, and the
desfire to steal them with a high hand will become
acute. It will be a poor specimen of a thinly-
peopled land that won’t be worth stealing in the
days that don’t seem to be so very far ahead.
How far ahead they are no one can say ; but every
time a country takes itself off the list of the
wheat-sellers and adds itself to the list of the
wheat-buyers, as Austria-Hungary, France and
Germany have recently done, the time of difficulty
has plainly come a step nearer. If the tremendous
and ever-increasing consumption of coal and iron
produces scarcity and famine prices in these
articles, and men are driven, for the sake
of fuel and building material, to start
replanting the forests which they formerly demo-
lished to make room for wheatfields, the move-
ment will be hurried up materially. In fact,
unless man stops the present multiplication of
sinful yellow journals,, he will have to resume a
great deal of his wheat-lands for forestry, in any
case. The yellow journal (New York size), printed
on wood-pulp paper, is an amazing timber eater.
All the woods and forests mentioned in all Shak-
SPEARK’s works, and all the cedars of Lebanon to
boot, would have been consumed by modern yellow
journalism in a very few years—consumed to tell
the tale of the society divorce case, the latest
nigger-burning, and the flogging in Tennessee of
a Baptist preacher’s young second wife by her two
infuriated step-daughters, named Mercy and
Charity.
* * * *
It is commonly assumed that when a nation
ceases to increase it has started on the track of
active and positive decay. Hence the worry
about the birthrate. But it is quite evident that
the increase must stop some day, means
general decay or not, unless the more virile and
valuable races do something painful, but humor-
ous and wholesale, to the less valuable
ones ip order to make room. It is hard
at times to realise how large a spurt the world
has put on within quite recent times. England
has accumulated three times as many people in
the past century as it did in all the previous years
since the Creation ; that is to say, in the period
between the first verse of Genesis and the year
1801 it raised a population of 8,892.536, and in
the period between 1801 and 1909 it added
26,864,079 to these, making a total of 35,756,615.
All these extra folk have to be fed, yet the local
available food-growing area is actually less,
partly because more of the land is required for
building purposes, and partly because some of it
has recently fallen into the sea and been drowned.
(This last is an old trouble; Earl Godwin’s
estate fell overboard as far back as the
year 1100 and made the Godwin Sands.) In
about the same period the population of the
United States has multiplied by 15; that
of Java by eight, that of Australia by
something like 720 ; and there are other cases
almost as remarkable. In face, England is almost
an example of stagnation ; compared with such
countries as Prussia and Finland, it is re-
garded these days, despite its wonderful in-
crease of population, as a slow-moving place, and
it is probably below the European average. The
nigger of various shades, who was apparently,
while under his own rule and control, rather a
diminishing circumstance, is now almost every-
where more or less under the white man’s guid-
ance, and he seems to have started to expand
wonderfully in his new conditions. (It is a craze
of the white man’s, these days, to try to save
and perpetuate and multiply even the most
useless variety of nigger.) Then both the
white man and the nigger are acquiring
new wants which fill up space that used
to Vie available to grow grain, and meat, and wool,
and timber for house building and fuel, in the
days when man wanted but little here below ; the
room required for motor garages and rubber
forests for the supply of motor and bike tyres, and
the open areas that have to be reserved for the
rising and alighting (sometimes too suddenly) of
airships are a few matters among thousands which
didn’t affect our simple ancestors of long ago.
As a side issue of the case—during the recent cen-
tury, or perhaps even the recent half-century,
man has probably done more in the way of using
up the world’s irreplaceable capital in the
shape of coal and iron than he did in all
the previous ages of history and th'e ages
before history. He has probably done more
in the last 100 years to strip the earth of
its forests than he ever did before in 2000 years.
And it is very probable—though as a great part
of the world supplied no statistics until yesterday
or thereabouts this is only guesswork —that
he has, since the year 1800, done twice as
much, taking the world as a whole, to multiply
humanity than he did in all the ages since the
monkey ancestor came down from the tree-top
and commenced, in a tentative sort of way, to keep
house. Also, the discovery of new continents has
finished, and it is necessary to be content with
silch land;as we have, unless something;can be
done with a burning glass to shift the superin-
cumbent Polar ice and snow, so that it may be
possible to grow crops on the site.

So out of this welter of circumstances it comes
to pass quite naturally that bread has a slightly
upward tendency. It is difficult to see what else
it can Vie expected to have. *' '

The Decentralisation Burlesque.
That plodding and humorless institution, the
N.S.W. Decentralisation Commission, has accu-
mulated so much deep thought and consideration
that it now wishes to postpone its report till
February. It requires the extra time that it may
tie a towel round its head and think. The Com-
mission has been a jest from the beginning, and it
promises to maintain its character to the last. It
was,appointed to find out: (1) If there are other
harbors in N.S.W. besides Port Jackson, or if
they were put on the map by ace.dent of malice
or with intent to deceive; (2) if the water
in these harbors, supposing they exist, is as stated
on the chart or otherwise ; (3) if it is good to have
harbors, or if those of N.S.W. (apart from Port
Jackson) are so different from those of other
countries that it is better that they should be
ignored and suppressed ; (4) if 350 miles is a
greater distance than 100 miles— i.e. , supposing a
district is 350 miles from Port Jackson and only
100 miles from Twofold Bay, whether the latteris
really closer or whether it is an optical illusion ;
and (5) whether the extra cost involved in send-
ing produce for export 250 miles of a needless
journey is compensated by the enjoyment the
goods get out of the trip and the scenery. Over
these points the Commission has been labor-
ing heavily for a number of months. N.S.W.
has really only a few ports that are fit to
receive large ships; that is to say, it has
two or three which could be adapted to the busi-
ness with very little expense, and some others
which could be adapted at a great deal of cost.
The first are well enough known and quite easy
to find. Each has an important district behind it,
and plainly only wants railway communication at
reasonable rates, some wharves and other simple
appurtenances, and the laying out of a township,
and business would commence. The fact that
people want to use these harbors is evidenced by
the fact that, in the old days of road carriage,
when all places were fairly equal, sucb
dead and forgotten places as Twofold Bay and
Jervis Bay were flourishing centres of oversea
trade. They were afterwards handicapped out of
existence by the policy which gave Sidney rail-
way communication and denied it to them ; but
that is another story. The fact that it would pay
N.S.W. to open up two or three good ports needs
no weary, superfluous Commission to prove it.
And there is nothing so wildly unusual or experi-
mental or revolutionary in the idea of building a
few miles of railway with a wharf at the end (in
every case a very few miles of railway are re-
quired) that it should be approached with the
caution that one would naturally use in the case
of a gorilla. The whole elaborate inquiry is a
burlesque. And while the burlesque goes on,
Parliament is being committed in haste to so
many lines devised to perpetuate and increase the
old congestion policy that, when the Commission
ultimately toddles in with its wonderful report,
there will probably be no money left, and that
fact will serve as an excuse for sending the docu-
ment to its long home in the coal-scuttle.


The periodical disordered cry re our black brother
Binghi is in full blast these days. Reverend and
other gentlemen fill much space in the daily
papers with unprovable statements concerning
him, and with dubious legends re the deep
damnation of his partial taking off. The people
who did the evil deeds enumerated are dead
now—just as dead as the early English invaders
from Germahy who bogged in. to utterly exter-
minate the older inhabitants of England, and
came within an ace of blotting out a much better
natiop than BiNGHI ; so there is nothing much to
be gained by digging up the ancient stories; but
the digging habit seems incurable. One excited
cleric (W. J. Gunther by name)supports his case
with the statement that “ the Great All-Father
gave them ” (the Binghi people) “ this continent
for an inheritance,’’ which is a fine example of the
utter recklessness of parsondom. For all the evi-
dence to the contrary, the original owners to
whom God gave Australia for an inheritance
were killed off millions of years ago, and the
present Jacky Jacky may represent the last of a
long succession of slaughterous invaders —in other
words, his title to the land may be a lot worse
than ours, for he didn’t cultivate the land and we
do a little in that way. There is much talk, too, in
this correspondence about how the nigger was
wiped out by “ the white man’s vices,” which is
also mostly an ancient story, and goes to show
the unfitness of Binghi, who couldn’t stand against
"vices” which the white man easily survived.
And there is very little talk about how, at this,very
day, the only important section of the black people
which remains is being wiped out by the brown
and yellow men’s vices—by Chinese opium and
Japanese sin and Malay bestiality. The average
parson would just Mate to sayan unkind word
about a Chinaman, dap or Malay, so the process
of extinction goes on with no clerical’ protest
which counts for anything. Meanwhile, close
alongside us, there is a colored race which might
still be saved and which seems to have
much greater possibilities than the black Aus-
tralian, and it is going downhill with a
remarkable lack of Church inte. ference. The
native Fijian has diminished something like 60
per cent, in 60 years. He began to disappear
when that human rabbit, the Indian coolie, was
introduced in the interests of cheap labor; but
the Indian is a nigger, and the Church is loath to
speak ill of any nigger; so Brown Brother is
shoved into the deep blue sea very unobtrusively.
If he departed to make room for a white
man the curse of the tabernacle would split
the air asunder, but as he is giving way
to a greasy and objectionable, but sturdy
black, the case is different. The clerical attitude
towards Binghi is a striking example of the un-
practical character of the Church. It devotes
itself, in theory at least, to the preservation, and
still more to the multiplication, of the unfit. It
prefers the unfit—-presumably because, by reason
of their infantile intelligence, they can be
beguiled into treating the parson with more
respect than people of bigger brain. So far as all
available evidence goes, there is no ultimate hope
for a race which is incapable of developing some
kind of a civilisation of its own, and Binghi, who
left in all Australia not one single public work, is
plainly one of the incapables. When a more
advanced people come along, the incapables pass
out, either by disease, violence, or invisible
causes. The Church objects to this—in theory,
at least. If it had its way it would preserve them
all, and the earth would be full of them, and
there would be no room for the more hopeful
races. Its theory is that the white man is always
wrong and that the nigger is always right. There
is no aboriginal so small, hairy and hopeless that
it won’t weep over his peaceful exit. Of course,
all men-—even the hairiest and least progressive
nigger—must die, but if there isn’t an abundance
of hairy and unprogressive nigger born to pre-
serve the race and keep the world filled with the
unfit, the Church takes the matter greatly to
heart. And in this matter the Church is up
against a tough proposition. In fact, it is an ant
fighting against the Inevitable.
The Usual Blow-off of the Fat Landlords.
The closing days of Victoria’s session afforded a
fine exhibition of the combined disasters of a tired
Premier and an obstreperous House of Fat Land-
lords. Having put through about a quarter of his
session programme, John Weary let the other
three parts slide, including his Workers’Accidents
Compensation, Preferential Voting, Closer Settle-
ment Amendment, Land Acts Amendment,
Mines Act Amendment, Sunday Entertainments
Bills, and others of more or less importance, and
set himself to save such remnants as the Fat
Landlords condescended to allow him. The Land-
lords were in good fettle. They seized the Rail-
ways Laws Amendment Bill and struck out the
clauses providing for; a permanent Board to inquire
into railway accidents—to which Weary said
“Orright.” They cut various clauses out of the
Spirit Merchants Bill; and Weary was saying
"Orright” when Gray, who sponsored these
clauses, objected, and the Bill was lost altogether.
They threw sundry clods into the Factories Act
amending bill—and once more Weary said
"Orright.” They " reviewed ” the Metropolitan
Rivers Bill after their own fashion, and Weary
nodded; but the Laborites...talked the measure
out. They rushed through the Coroner’s Bill, a
large measure which needs thinking over—and
the Assembly decided to leave the thinking over
till next session. Finally, they laid hold of the
Public Works Loan Application Bill, which ap-
portioned £202,000 for State Cool Stores at West
Melbourne, Ringwood and Diamond Creek, and for
assisting the progressive Geelong Harbor Trust
to get to business. These items were manifestly
designed to assist the producer, especially the
exporter of mutton, lamb, etc.; but the Fat
Landlords had no use for the producer just then,
all their ears being engaged by the lobbyists,
mainly from the private butter and meat
exporting films; so they tossed it aside
altogether. Weary professed himself much
annoyed over the "disgraceful lobbying”—
" the galleries of the Council reeked of butter,”
he said. But what good does that do?
In June last he had a chance to put up a fight
against the Landlords and improve their manners ;
but, as usual, he did nothing. Now they kick
him for his pains, which wouldn’t matter if they
didn’t incidentally kick the people too. In grati-
tude Weary is expected to fight for the right of
the State Landlords to go on kicking both him
and the people, and to whoop up his State to vote
“No ”in the coming referenda. But if Weary
is fool enough to do it, it isn’t likely that the
people will be.
The Rush of the Jerry Builder.
The Tasmanian Parliament fled from the wrath
to come by considering no less than 92 Bills in the
past session. Of these, in the frantic endeavor
to show the people that it is a live, active
body, it passed no fewer than 72. Ten others
are left in a state of suspended animation ; six
were slaughtered to make room for the Christmas
holidays ; and one (Local Option) lapsed in com-
mittee. The fact that the House of Gant (late
Dodkry) only rejected three Bills is also a
record. It goes without saying that these three
were useful and democratic measures: Compul-
sory Purchase (Closer Settlement), Shearers’
Accommodation (which is badly wanted), and
Testators’ Family Maintenance (to block a man
leaving his money to a Lost Cat Institution while
his family goes hungry). The House of Dodder
considered these proposals altogether too great an
interference with the Liberty of the Suspect, or
the rights of dead men, or something. Despite
the fact that the Eighteen Dry Bones were
all the session working with one eye on the
storm-shadow of the Referenda, they grew reck-
less towards the end of their job, and went in for
the mutilation of all the industrial Bills submitted
to them. They emasculated Workmen’s Com-
pensation by deleting the “industrial diseases”
clauses, struck Wages Boards a blow by inserting
the offensive “ reputable employer ” provision,
and stuffed in a clause to make strike-talk a £5OO
luxury; and when they won in the undignified
scramble they showed their magnanimity by pass-
ing no less than five syndicate Bills in a few
hours without turning a hair ! In spite of the
tremendous effort to show the people that the
State Parliament is the real Mackay, and that no
extension of Commonwealth power is necessary,
the only measures among the 72 that Tasmania
would not be as well without are the Land and
Income Tax and the Payment of Members Bills
—and these, not for their present value, but
because they embody the democratic prinpiples
that the unearned increment of land is a fair
subject for taxation, and that to expect mem-
bers of Parliament to work for 38s. 6d. a
week and remain reasonably honest, is folly.
So all the rush will go for nothing : the people of
Tasmania won’t measure up the value of the State
Parliament by the fact that, in a stampede, it
passed 72 bills in one session, but rather by the
fact that the net result of 50 years’ State Parlia-
mentary work is a steady loss of population. The
worst thing a Go vernment can do for a country is
to drive its people away while it heaps a greater
pile of debt on those who remain ; and the Tas-
manian Government has done all that. Where-
fore the 72 Bills count for no more than the frantic
haste of the jerry-builder.
Break of Gauge.
There are times when even the bitterest State
Brighter shouts for Federal encroachment, and
one of these happened along recently when Syd-
ney Telegraph clamored that the Commonwealth
should take on the job of changing, the State rail-
ways to a uniform gauge. Its proposal—rather
vaguely expressed—was that the States should
pay half the cost and the Commonwealth the
other half. As there would be nothing gained by
the Commonwealth paying half the money out of
taxes raised at the rate of so much per head,
and the States contributing the other half
also at the rate of so much per head, it is
presumed that the Telegraph’s idea is that the
Commonwealth should charge one-half the bill
to Australia at large, and the other half be paid
by the States in which the alterations are made.
The paper, of course, demanded that the N S. W.
gauge should be adopted, so that N.S. W. wouldn’t
have to pay anything towards the second half of
the bill, which would be an interesting position
for the State whose breakage of faith with Victoria
started the original difference of gauge and laid
the foundation of all the trouble. But the whole
idea is too clumsy, likewise too thin. The fact
that Australia must have a uniform railway gauge
is obvious enough, but it doesn’t follow in any off-
hand fashion that the 4ft. of IN.S.W. is the
measure to adopt. Certainly, it would be a wild,
mad Commonwealth that proposed tospend millions
on that sort of a job without first making a
thorough test of the mono-rail in Australia. And
whatever the new system may be, the only possi-
ble method is to transfer the railways bodily to
the Commonwealth, and let it do the work and
debit the cost against the whole railway system,
which is the same as charging it to the nation at
large. There is no method by which it can be
apportioned among the States to the complete
satisfaction of anybody ; even the Telegraph's
artful idea by which its own State would pay
next to nothing, while Queensland, S.A.
and Westralia carried the gigantic end of
the bill would probably excite annoyance in many
quarters. And the idea of the Commonwealth
reconstructing the State railways, and then re-
tiring from the field and leaving the cantankerous
State Governments to start the trouble all over
again would be an absurdity. One trouble of that
sort is more than enough.

The Minister of Grace and Elegance.
The letter of “ Charles Cowbell ”
There are many good points in “ Henry llousecollar’s ’
suggestions for the consideration of the new Minister of
Grace and Elegance (B. 29/12/’10). The overhead foot-
path idea is just frabjous. It gave me purple visions of
sauntering® on summer evenings with an armful of girl
and eyes full of the view—a view, I make bold to say, far
superior to any of the landscapes (which I have never
seen) where our fish and banana merchants were raised.
It also opens the delicious prospect of being able to get
about the city at one’s ease without passing the haunts
of rapacious creditors ; likewise avoiding the smells of
Dago restaurants, low pubs and ole clo’ shops. The pro-
posal seems to me on a higher plane than that of always
moving roadways in H. G. Wells’s “ When the Sleeper
Wakes.”
All right-thinking people will agree with the abolition
of hoardings. Though some posters are pictures, they
are slapped alongside atrocities ; and the hoardings at a
little distance look like crazy-quilts made by the insane.
There are 350 reasons why all street advertising should
be abolished, besides one which I advance modestly, viz.,
that the proper meejum of advt. is the newspaper.
Apart from these matters, I wish to protest violently,
in the sacred names of Grace and Elegance, against this
city of Sydney—with its dog-leg streets, its narrow cork-
screw lanes, its hit of ruin nearby a slap-up modern
mansion of commerce, its few quaint old houses with the
broad arrow stamped on every stone, its general irregu-
larity and corregiosity which, witli the harbor, make
it the plum city of the South—this quaint old young
place in which the eighteenth century and Early Vic-
torian rub shoulders with the late Edward and Allen
Taylor styles—this city, with its poetic allurement and
its artistic surprises (includingorange peel, broken fences
and erratic pavements)—against this city (excuse me if I
seem to be getting tied up ; but this matter affects me
more keenly than anything since Uncle Joseph died) ; pro-
test, I say, against this city being levelled on top,
straightened into parallelograms, and painted a uniform
color.
The one crying need of this raw young country is
ruins. Years ago, Victor Daley talked of the establish-
ment of a Society for the Erection of Ancient Ruins in
Australia —a brilliant suggestion, which fell on stony
ground. Sydney is the only part of Australia to do any-
thing towards providing ruins which would help to
develop a romantic spirit and keep the minds of the
young from horse-race and two-up. I therefore implore
The Bulletin to use its influence against Sydney being
H iusmannised in the manner suggested by Mr. “ Horse-
collar.” Besides, if the Japs come shortly after 1915, as
The Bulletin often warns us they may, why should we
spend good money on alterations which will he smashed
to inartistic ruin by their shells?
Let us have a Ministry of Grace and Elegance by all
means, and let “ Henry Horsecollar” be given power to
try his policy on the dog—to wit, Yassberra.

Premier Vkrran, of S. Aus., who boiled over at
the usual trite and harmless reference to human
“ interdependence ” made by the Governor at the
S. Aus. Anniversary Day feed, was apparently
suffering from the consciousness that he and his
State Government had made a mess of things
during the carters’ strike. On behalf of Verran’s
police, it was publicly stated that it was no breach
of the law for strikers to take horses out of vehicles
in transit; and when that announcement was
received with astonishment, the worse excuse was
made that laws obtaining in ordinary times don’t
apply in strike time. The Inspector of Factories,
who was about to start prosecutions under the
existing law, was suspended. A Labor M.P.
sat in state at the Trades Hall issuing
permits' to citizens to go about their
ordinary business—permits to remove luggage
and obtain petrol for motors. Insurrection
and tocsin and Carmagnole complete, and the
Labor M.P. in the Hotel de Ville issuing permits !
There was no guill itine and nobody was hoisted
a la lanterne ; but what was done was enough and
too much. If the Arbitration Court can’t work
quickly enough its machinery must be altered so
that it will ; but there is no room in the one com-
munity and at the same time for the scientific
protection of the worker by law and the bludgeon
of the strike or lockout, with the Labor M.P.
sitting in his office issuing permits.

Dr. Maxwell, for some years the Queensland
Government’s sugar expert and controller of the
State’s sugar mills, is back for a while from
America and the South Sea Islands. There isn’t
a man in Australia with greater practical experi-
ence of the Yellows and Browns; and this is his
straight tip to Australia :
Australia’s danger lies in the East. This is the final
otitpost of the Pacific, the last great vacant country, and
the eyes of the East are on it. I know the Chinese
and the Japanese well, hut it is the Japanese who
are most to be feared. It is well to keep out
aliens from this country and preserve it for the
whites. If the Japanese were to get any sort
of foothold on Northern Australia, you would never
he able to drive them out, and there’s no telling what
the result might be. Every Japanese is at heart a soldier.
I spent some time in Hawaii in March last, and I learnt
something about them. There are large numbers of
Japanese in Hawaii, and they are drilling every night—
ostensibly for amusement. And they have arms, too ;
they smuggle rifles in. Australia cannot afford to take
any risks with the Japanese, for they would do the same
thing here if they once got a footing. By-and-bye, as I
say, you will get thousands of immigrants from Am rica,
and they will help you to defend this country ; hut in the
meantime Australia is an empty land, and trouble may
come sooner than one expects. Her one great need is
population.”
“ Wonga”: I have been waiting for N.S.W.
Minister for Works Griffith to correct, or add,
or do something to a recent interview published
in the S. M. Herald. In the remarks attributed
to him, discoursing anent the barbarous methods
of Johnson’s railways in dealing with inventors,
Griffith referred to an inventor who, at his
(Griffith’s) suggestion, asked the railways to try
his patent. He was told that if he brought along
a full-sized model to a certain officer it would be
tried. He did so; and, after waiting a long time,
wrote and asked the outcome. He was informed
that it had been tried, and was an absolute failure.
He went along to collect his model, and found it
exactly where he had deposited it, and was
assured (Griffith’s words) by an attendant that
it had never been touched. When the model was
examined the paint was still in the sockets, etc.,
conclusively showing it hadn’t been used. This
is Griffith’s story ; and one waits breathlessly to
see what is to happen. But nothing, apparently,
is to happen. Griffith is a member of a Govern-
ment nominally in control of the railways, yet
there is no vigorous promise that the matter will
be ruthlessly followed up and the guilty people
dealt with. Someone must have written that
letter, someone must have authorised it, some-
one must have signed it. The trail is strong.
But Griffith apparently has no intention of
following it hotfoot. Anyhow, he doesn’t say he
will, though it is not expecting too much that he
should. Someone has told a rotten lie and evaded
a responsibility, dealing unfairly with a defence-
less man, and if the Government (of which Grif-
fith is a prominent member) intends to let the
-matter rip, it is a casual sort of Government —too
casual to attract many democrats. In the same
interview Griffith told the story of a railway
man who got hold of a valuable idea, and, upon
applying to the head serang for permission to
patent it (Griffith had previously drawn atten-
tion to an extraordinary regulation forbidding
railway men to take out patents without such per-
mission, a limit in autocratic tyranny), was told
he could do so at his own expense, provided the
Commissioners were given the right to use it free
of charge. Again, Griffith, as a member of the
Government, evidently feels he has fulfilled his
public duty by drawing attention to this matter.
He certainly made some remarks about the Works
Department giving inventors a fair show, but
omitted to add anything about what the Govern-
ment was going to say to Mr. Johnson. Which
is casual again, and not likely to inspire the
ignorant voter with much respect for the Govern-
ment which knows of injustices in public depart-
ments and doesn’t, apparently, intend to shift
them.

A feeling akin to cold feet lias been created in
Europe by the resolve of the Dutch Government
to fortify its coast. Holland’s two notable possi-
bilities are invasion from Britain and invasion
from Germany. The former may be left out of
the question, for Britain has no army which could
take on such an adventure in the face of European
opposition, but the latter is a very real possi-
bility. Therefore, the fortification of the land
frontier of Holland would be more understand-
able than the present move. The interpretation
which Europe puts on the matter is that Germany
has intimated to the Dutch Government (1) that if
Holland attempts to fortify its land border it will
be promptly swallowed : (2) that unless it fortifies
its coast-line it will be promptly swallowed ; (3)
that in any case it will be swallowed—in short,
that the shore fortifications are to prevent the
British fleet interfering with the swallowing pro-
cess. Presumably the eating up of the Nether-
lands by Germany isn’t very far off now. That
country was part of the old German Empire, and
the connection was so close that the original city
of Berlin was built by Dutchmen, and at least one
Dutchman became Emperor of Germany ; so the
Germans regard the place as a bit of accidentally-
dropped property which they are fully entitled
to recover. Also, Germany’s principal river wan-
ders into Dutch territory to the great inconven-
ience of German commerce, and some day the
Germans are coming to inquire about that river.
Like the British in Burnish and Beluehistan and
elsewhere, they are in search of a “scientific
frontier.”
An interesting wail was that of the chairman of
the Scottish Australian Investment Co. which
holds vast estates in N.S.W. and Queensland.
He spoke in the best British patronising style.
His company, it seems, has always felt kindly
towards Australian Governments, and hasn’t been
too proud to nod as it passed by ; and when Aus-
tralia recovers its senses and abolishes the pro-
gressive land tax, friendly relations will resume,
and the co. will wave its hand as usual. At
present, however, this country languishes under
the co.’s displeasure. It says the land tax is “ utter
folly,” and also that it is quite unnecessary, for
the co. has always been willing to sell its land.
That sounds very beautiful, but seeing that
after being 70 years in business the concern had
£1,191,000 of land still on hand a suspicion arises
that it is either a very cheeky liar or a very bad
salesman. And as the co. is now selling land in
Kiverina it would appear that the progressive
land tax was just the thing that was required to
give this ancient incorporated land-hog a much-
needed shove. It is partly because of vast, super-
cilious land-hogs of just this sort that the fertile
Kaverina, lying between two great rivers, has a
population of six persons to five square miles, and
three out of its 11 counties are actually losing
population. So the co.’s assurance that it will
again feel friendly towards the Australian
Government when that body “pursues a proper
course ” falls flat. Australia has no use for the
Scottish Australian Co., and after enjoying its
friendship for 70 years it is tired of the goods.
o
“ The Pariah” on the Victorian land-hunger :
In “ Plain English ” (B. 22/12/’ 10) mention is made of the
Shaw-Sculltn argument concerning Victorian land avail-
able formen with much energy and little capital. Shaw,
a squatter, says there is plenty of good land, but that the
men won’t take it. Scullin says th/ere isn’t, and that if
there was they would wolf it.
This is the plain tale of what I saw when with a survey
party in the Western District, where the argument
occurred.
In 1909 one of the Chirnsides sold a small area
of his holding at an average price of £6O to £7O per acre.
Everard Browne had the Goroorooke Estate subdivided
and offered for sale ; reserve price, about £5O per acre.
That is Shaw’s side—plenty of good, cheap land. Now
for Sculljn’s.
Striking north from Pomborneit, we surveyed a block
fronting Lake Corangamite. It was so rocky that in 241
chains of running we never drove a peg or dug a trench—
had to build angles, etc., in with stones. This block
would have kept all Victoria in road metal for 10 years.
Leaving Corangamite, we drove towards Camperdown on
the well-kept road running through Manifold’s and other
big squatters’ kingdoms. This was first-class agricultural
land, and was mostly busy drinking in the sunshine. At
Garvoc and at Arundel we surveyed blocks of poor third-
class land densely covered with stunted or un-
sound timber, useless except for firewood. Further
south, at Curdies River, three blocks of grasstree
and heath—doubtfully described as fair oat and
potato land—had been selected. Somewhere near
here a Government experimental farm went bung with a
loud noise. Thence eastward to Laver’s Hill the land is
really good, but stands on its end, so that it affords only
fair pasture for dairy herds. It was found impossible to
grade a road from one block. From here we used
“ packs ” to get to the Calder Swamps, where we first
surveyed a block with terrific slopes, covered with heavy
but mostly unsound timber. Then the swamps came in
for attention. Most of these blocks were practically a
mesh of weeds floating’ on black ooze, and the pegs used
were 7ft. stakes. Indeed, two blocks were so unstable
that it was just about impossible to carry the jigger
round the lines, let alone put the enclosure to any prac-
tical use. There is a mighty small fall to the sea-level,
and that is made worse by an intermittent bar at the
mouth of the Aire.
I met several of the men who had selected in the dis-
tricts mentioned. With one exception, they were young
and strong, and prepared to put great heart into their
selections. Bur, cut bono } In every case it meant years
of almost profitless labor, and after that not much more
than a living.
All this shows that squatter Siiaw is right. The laz t
devils don’t want good land that they can work at a pro-

fib. They prefer poor land that they can only exist on.
The annoying thing is that not a man in our camp could
see this, and on April 13 we walked 12 miles to lob our
votes for Soullin and the land tax, and prayed that the
thick end would be a darned sight thicker than Fisher
lias made it.
An Oft-Repeated Lie.
A great deal can be done by just sticking to the
old lie— sticking to it bard and fast, and dis-
regarding all proof to the contrary, and refusing
all explanations, especially when the lie is so silly
and so utterly insane that explanation is simply
impossible. This is the attitude of the gang which
clamors for the eastward deviation of the Port
Darwin transcontinental railway. As an example,
the Sydney Telegraph sprang off its tail — the
same old tail—in a leading article of January 3 :
Our correspondent at Port Darwin describes in a mes-
sage which we print this morning the dismal failure of
South Australia’s administration of the Northern Terri-
tory, and, in broad outline, the task before the Common-
wealth there as new proprietor. The outgoing ruler
must not be hastily blamed, for the work was at once
heavy and strange. A more energetic manager might
have succeeded no better in such an unaccustomed and
difficult sphere. What we may do,-however, is, render a
respectful tribute to the State which, after doing so
badly with the Territory, has managed to unload its
white elephant on to the Commonwealth, together with
its big accumulated debt, and on terms which assure that
railway communication shall only be through and with
the profiting State. Tiib railway conditions will have
TO BK DEPARTED FROM IK THE TERRITORY IS TO BE HELD FOR
Australia, since it is palpably impossible to keep con-
nection WITH THE NORTH OF A CONTINENT BY A SYSTEM WHICH
ALLOWS NO COMMUNICATION EXCEPT BETWEEN FAR NORTH AND
FAR SOUTH.
In other words, the Telegraph deliberately urges
Australia to break faith, and, having got the
Territory on certain conditions, to depart from
these conditions. And the reason it assigns is a
lie so utterly foolish that it shouldn’t impose on a
child, yet one which gains a certain amount
of attention through the sheer impudence with
which it is repeated at all times and seasons.
The theory of the deviationists is that the rail-
ways that strike westward from Sydney, Bris-
bane, Townsville, etc., can be carried far enough
west to join on to the transcontinental if the
transcontinental goes through Queensland and
N.S.W., but they can’t be carried far enough
west to join it if it goes through the Territory and
South Australia. Their theory is that railways
from the east coast to the west are impossible—it
must be so if railways extending half-way to con-
nect the east coast with a line in the middle of
Australia are impossible. They don’t say why this
is so, because the tale is so outrageous that it isn’t
safetogo in to detail; they just bump down the bare
statement. A railway connecting Queensland
with the Territory, they say, is perfectly feasible
provided that Queensland gets whatever profit
there is to be made by having the main line
within its borders. On the other hand, a railway
connecting Queensland with the Territory is im-
possible if the main line is in the Territory and
Queensland is only joined with it by branches.
It is quite simple and easy, it seems, fora railway
to cross the Queensland-Territory border at
Camooweal if it is the main Federal line brought
round deviously from Port Darwin. But if the
Federal railway goes due south from Port
Darwin, and the line which crosses the border at
Camooweal is only a subsidiary Townsville rail-
way extended to join the Federal undertaking-
well, it seems that even the earth will rise in
righteous anger and throw that railway off its
chest. The thing can’t be done, and the Sydney
Telegraph and the other deviation papers and
all the deviation politicians say so without show-
ing cause. Even the maddest or drunkest of
them couldn’t show cause. Wonderful calcula-
tions are made about how many thousands of
miles the trade of Cairns must travel in order
that it may reach Port Darwin via, Townsville,
Rockhampton, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne,
Adelaide and Central Australia generally, all
through the transcontinental line not being
diverted into Queensland and N.S.W., and how
many millions of leagues the trade of every other
place on the east coast must crawl round the
same gigantic circuit; but the reason of the cir-
cuit is left to the reader’s imagination. And
there are people here and there who have been
half persuaded, through much repetition, that
there may be something in the story, despite its
obvious madness.
A brilliant observation from a recent S. M.
Herald leading article :
It is a tragic circumstance that, ever since the Com-
monwealth began, hardly a session has passed without
bringing to light some piece of legislation or some piece
of administration that has made us suspect, for the time
being at any rate, of the English-speaking world.
It is very very sad, no doubt. Still, under Com-
monwealth legislation and administration, Aus-
tralia’s manufactures have nearly doubled in
10 years; its population has started to
increase at a rate that has been un-
heard of since the great gold days; its
bank deposits and its stock of cash have grown
in an unprecedented fashion ; its commerce has
gone up as it never did before ; the birth-rate has
risen, and the death-rate has fallen ; the unem-
ployed have almost vanished ; and though Aus-
tralia still borrows a great deal too much, it now,
for the first time in its life, finds most of the
money itself. If this sort of management has
made us suspected by the English-speaking world
—which may or may not b.e the case—it is quite
possible that it is the English-speaking world
that is at fault and not ourselves. For instance,
the London Morning Leader (23/11/’10) men-
tioned casually that in the English town of Hud-
dersfield (population about 95,000) there are fully
300 underground dwellings, and that it is common
enough there for six or seven people to live in a
cellar 12ft. by 14ft. and with a roof only 7ft. high.
'lf folk like that have dark suspicions concerning
Australia’s social legislation, it is a regrettable
business, but it is difficult to see liow the thing
can be helped. Seven people in a cellar four yards
one way and less than five the other would sus-
pect almost anybody or anything.

From the “Old Soldier”: —
It. almost seems as if the Commonwealth Government
was more than half afraid of taking the business of de-
fence too seriously. One of the highest authorities,
lecturing at Albury, is reported to have cautioned the
new Instructional Staff against over-zeal
“Don’t work the boys too hard at first,” said Colonel
Legge, in addressing the area officers in the course of one
of his lectures on their duties. . . “The public like a big
show, large numbers in uniform and carrying rifles, and
plenty of bauds. Later, the public will be so educated
that they will not judge by such show only ; but at first
they will want to see something for their money ; there-
fore, we must get ready for a big parade.”
That means a continuation of the old system of sham
and pretence. No one is to be worked too hard, for fear
he should be disgusted with soldiering. That does not
make for efficiency. But efficiency is not wanted, only
show. I have come across a letter sent by a German
“ one-year-volunteer ” to his grandparents soon after
joining his regiment. Here is, his story
“ As you are aware, I have joined an artillery regiment.
From 4.30 to 6.30 we work in the stables, rubbing down
horses, cleaning stables, harness and saddles ; and we are
expected to do it with so much vigor that we are wet
through with perspiration. Then we have a lecture from
the Lieutenant till 8.30. From 8.46 to 9.30 we have riding
drill; from 9.30 to 10, rubbing down horses; 10 toll,
drill. Then we go to dinner. At 12.45 there is roll-call,
followed by stables till 2.30; then drill from 3 to 5 ;
and stables, bedding-down and feeding horses from
5.30 r.o 6.30. After that we go home and study.
Then I drop into that most beautiful possession of the
present age—bed. But it is a fine life, all the same. The
few free moments are full of fun, with all the stories
comrades tell of the things they have done or are going
to do; and when you consider how healthy this sort of
life is, I feel jolly thankful I have strong, straight limbs,
and was able to become a soldier.”
There it is ; and it must be remembered that the one-
year-volunteer in Germany must do all this hard work at
his own expense. He must provide his own uniform,
board and lodging, and must pass a very stiff examination
to qualify him for the privilege of training for 12
months instead of two years. That is what makes the
German army the terribly efficient fighting machine it is.
Here in Australia we seem to be anxious to ask from our
soldiers the irreducible minimum of efficiency. According
to our Administrative and Instructional Staff, as we ball
it, the only object they have in view is to make the public
believe it is getting the worth of its money. Only boys—
senior cadets—are to be enrolled this year, and they are
not to be worked hard, the dears !

The writer took a mental ’bus this week
and drove furiously through the back files of The
Bulletin till an imaginary policeman stopped the
vehicle on a charge of cruelty to the supposed
horses. He was trying to find out when “Our
Miss Gibbs” started; but his dream on four
wheels didn’t get far enough back. The begin-
ning of the show that still rages at Sydney Royal
is so remote that it has become geological,-so to
speak. As for the end, it can’t be foreseen, for
during the glad New Year season the Religious
Editor drank the office telescope—that is to say,
he pawned it and surrounded what lie bought
with the proceeds.
** * *
“The Whip” still goes its way at Her
Majesty’s (Sydney) with a fair measure of success.
The fine staging carries it through, for thp play
itself is just the usual melodramatic kind of
picture drawn with blobs of black and blobs of
white. The hero is white, of course—a sort of
dazzling ass, to be considered through tinted
spectacles out of regard for the eyesight. If he
slipped on a mountain side it would be difficult
to tell whether he was a mule or an avalanche.
His folly suggests the former, and the nobleness
of his intentions remind one of the color of the
latter. And the villain is a coal-mine in human
shape—an ink-blot doomed for a certain time to
walk the earth. Between them is the figure of
the pure woman—but no words can do justice to
her. Her place is Heaven, not earth, and it is
only by carrying bricks around in her corset for
ballast that she contrives to remain on this mun-
dane sphere.
** * *
“The Arcadians” makes a first-class holi-
day bill; and, on the. strength of the crowded
business at the Criterion, partner Rupert Clarke
will be able to tack an extra week or two on to
his honeymoon tour of Palestine and other sacred
parts. There are no dull seconds in “The
Arcadians” —and the principals are brighter than
the seconds. No affluent cousin from the country
has done justice to either himself or his holiday
until lie has heard Mr. Doody’s motter and seen
how he lives down to it.
“The Girl from Rector’s ” has been having
a high old time at the Palace for nearly two
weeks, and so far she has not been arrested by
the police, warned by the Watchman, censured
by the Earnest Christian Workers’ Smile-Not
Association, or shunned, banned or sniffed at by
the church of the Woeful Wowsers. Also it
has to be recorded that she has not yet
been made an honorary member of the Com-
mercial Travellers’ Smoke-Room Union, nor
handed the emblem of the blue garter by
the Associated Band of High-Steppers. None
of these things has happened to the lady for the
excellent reason that she hasn’t earned one of
them; but she has earned the good will and
spontaneous hip-hurrah of audiences that have
filled the theatre nightly. Strangely enough,
with all the big business, Hugh J. Ward looks
gloomier as the season progresses. “ Every
night,” he says, “I am mentally saying good-
bye to those people down there. I know
them all well; and I keep wondering if I’ll
ever meet them again, and get the old thrill
of their friendship.” Here sympathetic silence
is expressed on all sides .of the actor-manager’s
dressing-room —he does this between acts. Then :
“Life is a mean sort of business, boys. Man
meets his fellow man, and passes” . Then
somebody hands along the bottle, and by the
time that has been attended to the callboy has
put his oar in, and the soliloquy has to stand oyer
for another night. But Ward swears he’ll finish
it if he has to keep the season running six months.
For all the information to the contrary, “The
Girl from Rector’s” may intend to keep going
that long herself.

Alfred Hill’s testimonial benefit at the
Standard Theatre, Sydney, on Monday night was
a crowded affair, as the house should have
been on all the eight nights of “A Moor-
ish Maid.” Lovers of bright and good
music—and there are many in Sydney—
may well hope that the “ Maid ” will shortly re-
appear in better setting and environment. “A
Moorish Maid ” ought to be at least half as
attractive as “ A Merry Widow,” even allowing
that the Maid labors under the disadvantages of
maidenhood and music of a higher order.
The Six American Dancers continue to
step gaily in the forefront of Sydney Tivoli bill;
and the Blessings, who have flowed from foreign
parts by mailboat, demonstrate every evening
that they are something to be extra-thankful for.
Frank Harwood, Fred Bluett, Fanny Powers,
and the Quealys are the other artists who are
entitled to the heartfelt gratitude of first-part
dodgers. The Meyrnotts’ season is billed to close
to-morrow (Friday) night, and their departure
will leave a fair-sized cavity in the programme;
but the final exit of the Virginian Judge, Walter
Kelly, who vanishes the same evening, will leave
a cave so large that unless it is immediately filled
by a landslide of talent it will certainly be taken
up by a syndicate of Middle Harbor hermits.
The Religious Editor is deeply pained to think
that a man with so much humorous capital is
about to leave the country.

At Sydney Glaciarium West’s Pictures
have struck a Bullfinch in the Beauty Competi-
tion. The local, family and patriotic interest is
fully aroused, and the audience rolls up to
judge which of the Sydney girls who travel
across the tremulous film is the most beautiful.
Up to date about 25,000 people have voted,
and the interest shows no signs of falling off. In
addition to the Beauty Show there is the usual
programme, with its regular intermixture of
comics, its occasional minor notes of tragedy, and
its pleasantly educational section, in which we sit
back and learn things about the world on which
we play the part of fleas.

At Sydney Lyceum Spencer’s Theatre-
scope has an impressive film of historical interest
showing the taking of Saragossa. Saragossa, it
will be remembered, was the Spanish town that
held out so desperately against the great Napoleon,
and which the French army found, after the regu-
lar fortifications had been smashed, “ to consist
of a great number of houses every one of
which was a fortress.” It is a fine, thrillsome
subject, and makes a most excellent film. The
dramatic film of the week bears the terrible name
of "Life for Life.” Mere words cannot paint its
thrillsomeness. “The Broken Doll” is an In-
dian story ; “ Wood Carving ” is the educational
item, and "At Sea Under Naval Orders” gives
an idea of life on the rolling wave under naval
conditions.

Maggie Papakura’s Maori Village at Clon-
tarf (N-S. W.) will probably get a lift after this week
from the opening of the Spit-to-Manly tramway.
Hitherto the big population which nowadays lives
under red tiles and straw hats on the northern side
of the harbor has had to take two water trips to
reach Manly ; after this week it will be able to
go the whole way by electric tram, except that a
punt must still make for it the perilous pas-
sage across Middle Harbor at the Spit. The
State Treasury probably won’t burst with the
ptofipff&m the line in competition with the four-
penny ferry ; but while Maggie Papakura and
the Arawa maidens are making soulful eyes to
them from Clontarf, at the Spit, a few thousand
holiday makers will no doubt feel called upon to
go the round trip—to Manly by water and back
by land.

Moorish Maid," at the Standard Theatre,

“ Billy B.’s ” place of amusement :
The only place in Sydney where a man can get any
excitement these non-electioneering times is at the
Stadium, a large open-air amphitheatre where profes-
sionals stoush to make a hoodlums’ holiday. I never
miss going there when a fight is threatened, and I never
regret what it costs me. When I say that, I don’t mean
that the fight, as a fight, is worth the money ;
mostlv it is worth nothing. The abolition of
the Marquis of Queensbury rules by American pugs
and slugs has removed all sporting and spectacular interest
from the game, and the proprietor of the average modern
bash-emporiutn is a plain, hard-faced citizen who sops up all
he can while the boom lasts, and treats the public like
the fool it is. But the ring-side compensations are many.
Last week there were two fight nights, and I don’t know
how many fights were crowded into them. On
Boxing riight, daring an unusually fierce round
between the professional sluggers, a couple of
spectators suddenly rose and battered at each other s
•noses, and made weird yelps, and kicked chairs
over, and rolled on tiie ground and stuffed sand and
gravel into one another’s mouths, while the crowd for-
sook the advertised encounter for the impromptu battle
in the dirt. A few minutes later one of the ring con-
testants struck the other below the belt and dropped
him like an axe-stricken sheep. Billions of in-
furiated men immediately sprang to their feet and
yelled and shrieked and cursed in every key in the
language. Behind me a woman stood upon a seat,
and raved: “ He’s killed the man ! He’s killed
the man ! ” until a big whisky-voiced person turned
and snarled: “D you; get home to yer kids.
But of all the thrills to date I best enjoyed
that of last Wednesday (28/12/TO), when a flash-Harry
individual from the land of the great hog-export trade,
who was acting as a second to a brother expert, waltzed
into the ring and insulted the referee (a gentlemanly per-
son who always reminds me of a young deacon). To the
utter amazement and great pain of the flash-Harry
person—who is a star-and-tripe pug of some reputation—
the referee promptly knocked the insult as far back as it
would go For the next five minutes Chaos beat time for
a whirling mass of pugs and their lovely following—
policemen, blokes, spielers, pressmen, hysterical youths
and others—all shouting:, swearing, hooting, pushing
and fighting towards the centre of the disturb-
ance. After the row I found myself alongside a
red-faced man with one end of his collar
torn away. Glaring at me malevolently, he said : “ Did
the referee job him.” I replied that the referee certainly
had “ jobbed ” him ? “Good enough for the cow,” he ex-
claimed. “I wish he’d broken his neck. Don’t
you?” I admitted I was a bit disappointed. Still, it was
a great night, and probably somebody will be killed next
time. I’ll be there on the off chance, anyhow.

BOURNE ROYAL.

At Her Majesty’s (Melb.) the Beanstalk
which lived in the House that Jack built con-
tinues to provide good fodder for the Cow with
the Crumpled Horn. Also, an Australian gun-
boat ploughs the village where the Fairy Queen
sows a Vegetable Ballet, and the curtain rises at
7 40 p.m. sharp on account of the magnitude of
the production. If the Williamson panto, seemed
a doubtful success on the first night, the doubt
must have passed away, for the treasury receipts
are enormous. Eight times a week until further
notice the Christmas Annual will'be repeated
amidst shrieks of approval from the children. 1 his
is a more osteiitatiously “comic” panto, than
some that have happened since the harlequinade
was finally abolished. A cow, armed with all the
qualifications for a cab rank, is a leading feature
of the show. The principal boy, who is a girl,
and the principal boy’s mother, who is a male
Scotch comedian with thistles in his accent, talk
gravely and sympathetically about the,cow > apd
when that obstreperous animal joins silently in
the conversation, a roar of general merriment is
quite permissible. In a well-regulated panto,
there are moments when the kiddies don t have
all the joke to themselves.
* * * #■
As regards “ The Old Woman Who Lives
in a Shoe,” at the King’s (its appearances are
confined to matinees), the present historian finds
it a matter of deep personal interest that he
can see nothing funny in a panto, played by chil-
dren Liddiard’s Lilliputians go through their
work without a hitch, and are plainly well pleased
with their performance ; but their happiness is
not contagious. They are neither amazing nor
amusing. Perhaps it is the libretto of the children s
panto, that gets on one’s nerves. There is abso-
lutely nothing in it which could bring a blush to a
curate at a Sunday-school picnic. What is called
“patter” in an ordinary music-hall song is re-
duced to “piffle ” in the ditties that the youngsters
struggle with ; and when six youngsters in suc-
cession have sung a series of long, soft songs con-
cerning spoons, moons and coons, a captious critic
grows discontented with his lot.
** * *
The mixture of frivolous melodrama and
flippant music, which serves the purpose of comic
opera at Melb. Royal, proves to be no better or
worse than it appeared on the first night. The
same remark applies to the new Clarke-Meynell
people, who are doing their best for “ The Gay
Gordons.” Nothing in the show is strikingly
bright or remarkably humorous, although a good
deal of it has an air of novelty. The lawyer
(Fred Winn), who discovers Angus Graeme’s
mysterious parentage and suddenly makes an
earl of him, is a matter-of-fact sort of
person until near the end of the piece,
whan he sings about Mr. Jolliboy and dances
his own accompaniment. He comes as a sur-
prise among the incidental “ turns,’ and is
acceptable on that account, whereas some of the
other “turns” are dragged in by people who
have been singing previously, and are not in great
demand for further contributions. For instances,
the crazy jingle of “Mr. McKie ” and the
“Limericks’” in which five members of the eo.
take part, are items that merely weaken the en-
tertainment by prolonging it. The tail of “The
Gay Gordons” is much too long for its body, and
should be shortened by 15 minutes at least.

Lieutenant Gordon flutes of his love in a voice
suggestive of turtle soup. Added to these mis-
fortunes, there is the talkative Highland sergeant

The large public relish for “ The Bad Girl
of the Family ” suggest that ’couta ean be caviare
to certain sections of the people. And yet the
present show at Melbourne Princess’s is one of
the least deserving of indulgent patronage. It is
full of irritations, from its dreadful humor to the
vulgarities of its comic Jew. Moreover, it seems
to ha,ve been produced on a scale of lavish inex-
pensiveness. Nothing, for instance, looks so
cheap as the picture of a room in Erskine Hall,
the alleged country seat of a noble lord. Here
the carpets and" ornaments shriek of the
second-rate and dingy genteel. Also, the furni-
ture, instead of being (say) after the mode of
Louis the Fifteenth belongs to the unexalted
style of Smith the Manyth.

Barnold’s dogs and monkeys, particularly
the dog Daniel, are the main support of the
Christmas bill at the Opera House. Later arri-
vals are Howard and Foy, and Wood and Fraser,
whilst Prince continues to expound the possi-
bilities of the concertina, and the pictures of
Greater London are staged as before. A few re-
appearances of the picturesque Marbas were to
end early in this week, and their vacant place will
be filled to-morrow.

West’s processions of pictures are still
floating past the eyes of Melbourne congregations.
On Saturday the best item on the bill was “The
Sergeant,” which detailed the adventures of two
affinities amidst Yosemite scenery. The customs
of the stork were a pleasant variation from the
manners of a person by the name of Foolshead ;
while the tale of “Bertie’s Elopement” was not
so popular as the story of “ A Lucky Toothache.”
This last had an odd simplicity, and it was so
naturally pretty that if strangled criticism with a
rope of roses, so to speak.

Amusement shows are being multiplied in
Adelaide, and almost every week the earnest
pleasure-seeker has to reckon with some new
“Arena” or “Casino.” (“Coliseum,” which
would be a fine name, has already been collared
for a drapery store.) These new buildings are
mostly devoted to picture-films or boxing. About
the latter the City Council has changed its mind,
and it quite enthusiastically granted a license for
an extra holiday battle to celebrate the Season of
Peace. At the Tivoli a shapely lady named
Yetta. just from Paris, walks a wire in a dashing
style that takes the mind back to stars of the
past. But they didn’t cakewalk on the
wire; in fact, they wouldn’t have known
hovit to. At the Tivoli “The Prince Chap” has
run its sugary course with Roberts and the
three heroines, and Maggie Moore now gets her
chance in “ The Chinese Question.” West’s Pic-
tures have the dramatic American war film, “ The
Road to Richmond,” and some round the world
scenes. The Empire has the same drama (why do
things get duplicated in this way ?), and is also
wisely specialising with local scenes—-Glenelg
beach on the 28th, and'so on.

“ Puketapu ” seeks information :
Can any old hand tell me what hidden insult lav in
calling a man “Joe ” back in the gold rush days of'Vic-
toria and Maoriland ? My father, Hemi, sometimes speaks
of the early days in Dunedin (M.L.), when sin and grog
and flying cash were the primitive town’s chief attributes,
and again and again he has recalled how riots and general
battery broke out through the hurling of the solitary
word “Joe.” The contemptuous remark was first
introduced bv diggers who had migrated from Aus-
tralia, and was particularly used as a gibe at the
police. In those days there was only one lockup
in Dunedin, and the whole town lay betw’een it and the
court-house, so every morning a long procession of
drunks, thieves, spielers, and Flossies with feathers that
would have made a brigadier-general’s hat blush for its
nakedness, was marched through the ill-formed and
(generally) mud-covered streets to be introduced to the
magistrates. Wives who had lost their husbands over-
night, friends who had been parted from friends in
a fight or debauch, riff-raff (and a nice collec-
tion of it there was then) and the general public
lined up regularly to see the march past; and to
yell “Joe” at the escort. ’Arrests always followed
the cry—it seemed to gall the police to fury/ Resistance
led to a free fight, arid batons, oaths, mud, handcuffs and
concentrated stoush filled the neighborhood with unholy
joy. My father never knew what “Joe” meant—since
the man-eating days he had lived at peace with his
fellows, and never inquired—but I would like to know ;
and if anybody can tell me I’ll be eternally obliged.
A Royal Commission might very well be
appointed to inquire into the case of the Dunedin
(M.L.) girl who went to the altar in full bridal
array, with relatives and friends in attendance, and
then burst up the ceremony by saying “No” to
the parson’s fateful question. A bridegroom-elect
may always be regarded as a possible non-starter
up to the very last moment. In most cases he
wants the girl rather than the marriage tie,
whereas she is dead set on achieving the contract
to which the man is the submissive party. On
the other hand, outside of bellowdrama, the lady,
before she proceeds to the scene of action, has in-
variably decided to see the wedding through. She
may intend to revolt against the man the moment
she has got him, but she means to get him first.
She doesn’t put on her war paint for
nothing. Her mind is made up, anyhow.
The wedding is her show, and she helps to make
it a complete success, otherwise she wouldn’t have
dressed herself for the star part. Consequently,
a bride who upsets an old-established order of
things by monkeying with the nuptial ceremony
is a matter for earnest consideration. She looks
very like a startling result of woman suffrage;
she’s a new development in the relations between
the sexes. Probably she’s an awful outcome of
wicked Socialism, and is directly due to the
Labor Party. Needless to say that she mustn’t
be allowed to establish a precedent. If bachelors
in general are confronted with the risk of becom-
ing rejected bridegrooms, they will treat the old
idea of a marriagb contract with lofty contempt,
and the necessity for divorce courts will soon cease
to exist.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“0.K.": The Johnson-Jeffries fight film, edited by
Jeffries, is even more deceitful than the film which dealt
with Johnson’s defeat of Tahmm.v Burns, and which issued
from the white man’s camp. The picture story of Jef-
fries v. the Niggah appears to have been arranged in the
interests of Jeff from the start. The ultimate hero never
gets a look into the picture until he appears in
the ring with a smile of confidence wreathed
around his ivories. All the preliminary scenes
are dedicated to Jeff and his white predecessors, and
they make one very weary. The predecessors—Jonel
Sullivan, Corbett, Fitzsimmons, etc.—are rather less un-
impressive than the man whom Massa Johnson was going
toknock out after they had all mustered todohim homage.
Jeff is a disappointing person. His appearance is somewhat
against him, and he is eternally chewing gum. Hisjawsare
at work in every scene. With a quid of the pestilent
Yankee notion in his mouth, and supported by a couple
of other ugly pugs, he is depicted as receiving a levee.
He just leers and chews and gives his hand to the visiting
pilgrims, who seemingly come along to tell him that he
carries all their hopes and dollars. And then
the fight ! Barring the final knocking out, which
comes as an inexplicable finale in this severely
edited picture, nothing has been left in which
could go to show how completely Jeff was over-
matched. The tenth or eleventh round—in the picture
—concludes with a rather furious onslaught by Jeff, the
artistic retaliations by the nigger having been cut out. In
the twelfth round Johnson actually downed Jeff, but the
picture gives no hint of that occurrence. In fact, so many
evidences of Johnson’s superiority have been eliminated
from the pictorial narrative that the climax seems ab-
surdly sudden. A cynical showman who knows the
tricks of the cinematograph trade remarked that the
showing of the negative was a mistake. They ought to
have shown the positive, which would have reversed the
order of color and represented a white man as triumph-
ing over a black.
“Ho”: A touching faith in the sanctity of the mar.
riage tie is displayed by certain of the characters in
“The Bad Girl of the Family,” who is misbehaving her-
self nightly at Melbourne Princess’s. The villain has
long pursued the heroine with unwelcome protestations,
and eventually he succeeds in having her young bloke
charged with murder, and sentenced to cessation of life.
The heroine and the villain (both of whom have a habit
of wandering around the prison in a promiscuous way)
visit him, and the latter announces that when he (the
hero) is rotting in lime he (the villain) will compel the
heroine to commit unmitigated matrimony. After much
noisy emotion, the hero is struck with a brilliant idea.
Calling the prison chaplain (who also happens to be wan-
dering around), he announces that he desires to wed the
worried lady. The ceremony is performed on the quick-
lunch principle. The chaplain tells the girl: “You are
now the wife of convict 56478A3X, who to-morrow will be
hanged,” and the heroine turns upon the baffled malefac-
tor and informs him, in deep-chested tones, that, as she
is a respectable married woman, he cannot harm her
now. Whereupon the evildoer retires “ down stage ”in
an unfastened condition to chew his moustache.
“Stargazer”: “The Gay Gordons’’asserts with the
emphasis of a 100-ton gun the grave need of an up-to-date
horticultural expert to supervise the culling of the
chestnuts for stage-plays. There are comedians here who
scatter gags as familiar in Melbourne as King O’Malley’s
hat, or the feet of little Willie Judkins. Japes that
were chafed threadbare in last year's pantomimes are
doped and put into circulation again ; wheezes as old as
Noah, and better known than his ark, are impudently
offered as good goods fresh from the vine. “The
Arcadians” got as far as billing an expert in corns. What
I’m earnestly looking for now is the time when every
management will have its expert in nuts.
“Bleriot”: Went the other day to Sydney’s first
aviation “carnival” and enjoyed myself terribly. There
were all of 50 people present when I arrived. They were
watching: several men under the direction of a lictle chap
mauling- a dirty-looking balloon about the ground. At
the end of half an hour the balloon was hoisted on a
clothes line between two posts, and 60 minutes later the
little chap roared through a megaphone that the hot-air
bag would ascend at 4.30 p.m., whereupon the balloon was
dragged down, and subsequently—-several hours subse-
quently—was replaced by an even dirtier one. By-and-b.ve
a start was made to inflate it; and still more by-and-bye
the little chap announced that, to allow those who had
arrived at 1 p.m. to see the show, the balloon would not
ascend until 5.30 p.m. Such is the inconsider-
ateness of human nature, this actually annoyed
them. After another long wait, the little chap
roared “ Let ’er go ! ” With the majesty of a one-winged
duck, the balloon rose fully 20ft., toppled over, righted
itself and waddled through the air straight for the Moore
Park rubbish tip. The little chap had floated off early.
The next item was announced after a pause of about 16
weeks. It took the form of two canvas wings; but as six
men and a boy staggered under its weight, it was clear
that it was no flier. By this time nearly everybody had
died from old age; still, a few remained to see the
“great monoplane trial.” This monopole turned out to
be a biplane, with an engine that refused to be aw'akened
out of its sleep : so, as the only thing at the “ carnival ”
that appeared likely to fly was time, I set out for home.
When I arrived I found that the old house had been
burned down the previous year.
“Snell”: Hughip Ward, on the occasion of his final
appearance as an acting-manager at Adelaide, told the
people he was joining the firm that had done more than
any other for the artistic side of the stage in Australia.
“Mr. Williamson’s life has been beautiful,”he said. “He
has assisted stage art and artists by every means in his
power.” I remember that, in a recent heated discussion
on the quality of the Australian stage and the duties of
Australian managers, it was Mr. Williamson’s representa-
tive who scoffed with Pagan ribaldry at artistic preten-
sions in theatrical managers, brandished the obvious
truism that running theatres is a business, and de-
clared that the first and fundamental principle of
a business is to make money, and the next principle is to
go on making money. But. your gifted management
always has two voices—the one which declares its own
virtues and its claim upon public gratitude as an artist
devoted to art for art’s sake, and the other (used in press
disputations only) which agserts the entrepreneur’s
sterling common-sense and Sound business aptitude in
giving the public what it wants, regardless of the clamor
of sore-heads who demand literary merit and dramatic
art and all that sort of visionary humbug.
“Spotlight”: “Theos,” in his par. (B. 29/12/TO) on
“ The Whip,” shows that his long suit isn’t a sense of
fairness, and that he is a little reckless with the facts.
That the Sydney papers are doing their best to boost the
production, and that it needs it, is an opinion not deserv-
ing of any great respect. The daily criticisms were not as
glowing as the success. Never before has drama at the Wil-
liamson tariff taken so strong a hold of the public- Sales
of seats have been shut down by manager Goodman
before curtain rise at every Sydney performance.
“ Theos ’’ mentions that the dailies chronicled “ cheer-
ing” on the first night, whereas, to his hearing, it was
“jeering.” He ought to consult both aurist and oculist.
I have searched the notices and can find nothing warmer
than “applause.” And there certainly was plenty of
that. Furthermore, it was a wonderfully smooth per-
formance, the scene-shifters handling their hundred tons
or so of Coleman with amazing alacrity. Judging from
what “ Theos ” saw and heard that didn’t occur, he ought
to change the brand.
“Stargazer”: Wonderful is the wit of the “local
allusion!” There are many bright sallies in Melb.’s
Yuletide shows —brilliant references to Doctor Billy
Maloney’s hat (which, by the way, is quite an ordinary
hat, and seems to have got mixed up with the cady of
Kink O’Malley), caustic and biting interpolations of the
name of one Judkins, scintillant epigrams about Swan-
ston-street dust, and poignant jests about the slowness
of Melbourne’s trams. These have for many years been
the themes of the mad wags who sling Australian cham-
pagne and southern sunniness into pantomimes imported
for Antipodean consumption. The method is simplicity
itself. Your low-comedian merely “ ups and sez ”
“Judkins,” or “Melbourne dust,” or “slow as a St.
Kilda tram,” and the thing’s done ; the groundlings roar
and the galleries howl. I explain this with the theory
that laughing at certain matters becomes a habit.
Theatregoers laugh at the things mentioned simply be-
cause it is habitual. The mention is not funny in any
way, nobody is really amused, but the crowd cachinnates
over the word “ Judkins ” just as it would sneeze over
pepper or cry over an onion.
IWA, THE MAORI CONTRALTO.
Iwa, the 18-year-old girl with the voice, who is with
Maggie Papabura’s Maori village combination at Sydney,
en route to London and further, is going to make a con-
cert reputation if she is looked after. She was “dis-
covered” by Richard Seddon at the Bluff, and was a very
small child in those days. Since then she has been en-
couraged by various musical celebrities who have visited
Maoriland, and has had considerable polish put upon her
vocal property by Miss Macintosh, a well-known Dunedin
teacher. What is needed now is additional polish and
cultivation, but the chances of obtaining it in a travelling
Maori pa are as remote as the chances of finding a
brewery in Gehenna.
Max Maxwell has commenced his tour round Austral-
asia with dramatic goods very successfully at His
Majesty’s, Brisbane. Manager George Portus writes that
since Boxing Night he has personally offered apologies to
2153 persons who were unable to gain admittance to the
show, and spent all his salary to cool down individuals
. who threatened to have his life for not providing seats

“On the Silvery Sands,” which is being- sung at Her
Majesty’s, Melbourne, is alleged to be reducing Lnu f
to a state of blithering admiration ; and the pu >n - ■

the rush to buy “ paltry paraphrases” and slavis 1 "
tations.” Yet this too popular composition is a -
ordinary'mixoure of slobber and raspberry jam, ■
kisses for commas and blissful hugs for the other pu ■
ation. It starts in the common time of two winks
bar, and then increases to an amorous throb, Liste
the chorus
On the Sands, on the Sands,
On the Silvery, Silvery Sands,
If the game of love you’d teach.
Take the dear little girl for a walk on the beach.
Then sit down for a while
And gently squeeze her hands, , ,

On the Silvery, Silvery, Silvery Sands.
“With her head on your chest, she will hope for the

“Minko”: Touching on stage villans. Why are these
unfortunate and unpopular adjuncts invariably compelled
to massacre numerous unnecessary victims before they
nearly .-•ccomplish their base designs? If a horse is to he
nobbled, the virtuous lady’s marriage lines purloined, or
the family jewels appropriated, several minor cha-
racters must be done to death, violently and
gruesomelv, although the pampered hero has
no difficulty in escaping every time. I assert, from
experience, that there is no earthly reason to
indulge in promiscuous slaughter before you effect a rob-
bery or forge a will. I’ve robbed scores of banks, faked
several missing wills, passed myself off successfully as the
heir to a title and large estates, shot the moon from a
few large hotels, and burnt terraces of mansions with the
people in them, disembowelled lOpolicemen, and scuttled
a ship for the insurance ; yet I never had to slay an irrele-
vant funny man or a heavy but well-meaning parent
while rushing headlong on the path of infamy. I just
killed the people I wanted to, and let the others slide.
No, the stage isn’t true to nature—not by a tall heap.
The Christchurch (M.L.) City Council is making
another attempt to stop the early-door scheme for drag-
ging an extra bob out of the theatrical customer. Last
.year a bylaw was passed providing that all seats must be
numbered off and exhibited on a plan at each entrance
door ; also, that when required to do so by the Council,
the manager must arrange for the sale of tickets
at some approved place at least eight hours before
the start of ihe show. And even if the purchaser of a
ticket didn’t roll up to collect his seat before 9 p.m., or
even 9.46 J p.m., his seat had to be supplied on demand.
The idea has worked all right in several big theatres in
London, N’York and elsewhere ; but it didn’t work in
Christchurch, mostly because managers or lessees didn’t
want it to work, and the bylaw had no punch behind it.
Now, however, by special arrangement with the Muni-
cipal Corporations Act, 1908, a default fine up to £2O has
been tagged on, and a dose of that physic is expected to
cure even the worst case of stubbornness.
“, Kodak ” : Somebody gave me a five-shilling ticket for
a concert in the Old Cannibals’ Association Hall ; and
having nothing better to do, I went. I found the place
without the assistance of a tramguard who didn’t know
it, or of a policeman who had never heard of it. A lonely
doorkeeper took my ticket from me and I was shown to a
seat immediately behind a stout lady, who was partly in
her evening dress. There were about 60 people scattered
round, trying not to look lonely amongst the polished
jungle of empty chairs. About, 8 o’clock, a girl dived
from behind the scenes and scuttled to the keyboard of
the triangular piano. An angrv-looking man with a
fiddle in one hand and a bow in the other followed her on
to the platform, and, facing the handful of abashed
people, sneered at them. I felt inclined to rise and
apologise for not being more numerous ; but, instead,
cowered behind the stout lady and waited. The violinist
laid the head of the fiddle on his neck, and, holding- its
one wooden leg with his left hand, started to make it
scream by sawing its chest. I am fond of melody, but I do
not care for difficult exercises; so I let the angry man
escape without applauding him. Then another young
woman with feathers in her hair appeared, and, sitting
at the piano, chattered prettily, in best high school style,
through five cream-puff recitations. Two of them were
ancient friends, and one was in German or Choctaw.
Everyone tried to look as if they understood
every word of it. After that a young man sang
an unusually long song, and a tall young woman
sang an unusually sad one. Another cream-puff
recitation by the lady with feathers in her hair followed.
Then there was an interval without refreshments. The
second part of the programme bore a strong resemblance
to the first, and the whole show expired somewhere in
the neighborhood of 10 o’clock, when the audience—in-
cluding the sheltering stout lady—faded down the stairs
and helped to fill a passing tram. I know of no more un-
comfortable or futile thing than the high-priced evening
entertainment of garden-party standard in an obscure
hall which can only be found by the determined ex-
plorer. The artists are always infuriated at the smallness
of the audience, and express their sentiments by making
faces at the piano-lady. The audience is horrified at the
waste of empty chairs, and panic-stricken at the grimaces,
and tries to atone by nervously applauding anything and
everything. This merely makes the artists make more
faces and talk at the piano-lady out of the corners of
their mouths. At various times I have made heroic
efforts to overhear these asides ; but my hearing is not as
good as it was, and I am reduced to making wild guesses.
I do wish, though, that these clever entertainers who ap-
pear at the Old Cannibals’ Association Hall would look
more kindly on the faithful few who neglect to be absent
from their shows. I have been sneered at so often for
not being a whole row or tribe that I am getting dis-
couraged.
It is cabled that the artistic “Pill” Beecham is dis-
appointed at the result of his third opera season in Eng-
land. His third venture was at Covent Garden, where he
produced Strauss’s “ SalomA” From private sources,
The Bulletin hears that £40,000 of Pill, senior’s, money
has been dropped in backing Pill, junior’s, love of music
—which is bad for only a three-winters’ experiment.
Twenty-four more such experiments and the Beechams
would be working in their own factor.v, filling the boxes
that are “ worth a guinea” each.

SEMIRAMIS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The story of Semiramis has been bioscoped.— Trade
announcemen t.
What liberties these picture-fellows take !
They range the world, through Arctic zone and Tropic ;
And even ancient history they fake —
They follow Moses round and round, and make
Semiramis a story bioscopic.
Some say she was descended from the gods,
And others that her origin was shady ;
So scandal goes about with winks and nods :
But, light of love or goddess, what’s the odds?
At any rate she was a Perfect Lady.
She was a queen Assyrian—passing fair,
Concerning whom more kings than one had quarrels ;
And please remember (should she raise your hair)
The habits of 1200 B.c. were
Quite different from twentieth-century morals.
But whether goddess, or—the other thing,
Semiramis grew up extremely pretty ;
And she could dance the Babylonian fling,
And chansonettes Assyrian she could sing—
Songs highly-spiced and most uncommon witty.
Now when we find a woman just like that,
To any way she chooses she’ll incline us ;
And so, where’er she made her habitat,
Semiramis had monarchs in her hat,
And by-and-bye she nobbled old King Ninus.
A lusty old campaigner was King Nine ;
He could have made a meal of all your wowsers 1
And what an oath he muttered o’er his wine
When this fair woman, whom they called divine,
Came out to give him battle—wearing trousers!
King Ninus won the tournament, of course,
And took her home, and kissed her oft and clammily ;
But soon would thank his stars for a divorce,
Because the grey mare proved the better horse.
The missus wore the trousers in that family !
Beside his couch some evenings she would sing,
And make old Ninny cut such funny capers,
Till, in a doting mood, the ancient king,
Gave her his sceptre and his signet-ring,
And quite a bundle of official papers.
Then came a night when Ninus couldn’t sleep,
Lulled by’ the usual minstrelsy 7, or hear it;
His head was on no cushion soft and deep,
But lay inglorious on the rubbish-heap,
And —funny thing—his body wasn’t near it.
Up rose Semiramis, and donned the crown,
And looked Too Sweet in filigree and Tyrian,
And sent her heralds running through the town
To say, “Oh yes ! Oh yes ! Bow down ! Bow down,
Ye Babylonians! I'm the Queen Assyrian ! ”
And how she sent plain miscreants to death,
But gave to handsome criminals their pardons,
How men at sight of her drew quicker breath,
And how (for here each story differeth)
She built, or didn’t build, the Hanging Gardens ;
And how she conquered Egypt and the Nile,
And led stuffed elephants against the Injuns,
And how her son displayed a traitor's guile—
These things would take up space ; and all the while
The Editor is swearing red-hot vengeance !
Semiramis is dead : her pride lies low ;
Thus perish all diurnal things ; so be it !
But meditating on that long-ago,
Unless they’ve bowdletised the picture-show
I rather think I’d like to go and see it.

“What show?” I asked. “ ’Twas some new biand,”
Bill said. “Lor’, can’t you tumble?

SOCIETY
PENFOLD'S
WINES
Melbourne’s long-promised concert hall
has reached the stage of definite announcement.
.T. and N. Tait are the prospective lessees. The
hall is to be the ground floor and two storeys of
an eight-storev building on the site of the old
Presbyterian Assembly Hall in Collins-street,
nearly opposite the Athenaeum ; so the two halls
in the Athenaeum building will be considerably
assisted as show places by the attraction of crowds
to the tony establishment on the other side of the
road. When the up-to-Tait concert hall comes
into service, the ill-conditioned Town Hall will
be abandoned by music purveyors unless the
drowsy City Fathers do something towards making
it cosy. If the drafts were shut out by an inner
enclosure, the Town Hall might still retain its
place in the show market; but as Melbourne’s
principal concert hall it will cease to be when the
new building is completed. The Taits’ hall is to
have a foyer, 10yds. square, on the ground floor,
leading to the balcony, and the auditorium will
give a full view of the platform to 2000 seat
holders. The present idea is to call the place the
Auditorium, though that doesn’t bite the ear very
hard.
LOVE AND ITS LODGINGS.
SHE: “ Ah! Love in a cottage"
HE: “is a castle in the air"
Very few men die standing up, and the
perpendicular corpse is exceedingly rare. A Vic-
torian constable found one last week by the side
of the switchback White Horse-road, which alter-
nately climbs and coasts eastward from Melbourne.
The deceased was leaning thoughtfully on a bicycle
as if he was having a good rest after climbing a
stiff hill. It was evidently a case of overworked
heart. When he plays the bushranger, Death
generally intercepts the traveller at the bottom of
aslope; but on this occasion he quietly tracked
his victim along the undulating road with the
ominous name till the time came to gently end
• the lonely ride.
“ Yigihms ” : Though
the C. of E. Bishops and
Archbishops of Australia
have begun a crusade
against the maltreatment
of Black Brother, I
don’t believe they
know the size of the
job they have under-
taken, or how des-
perately it calls for
attention. In the
Northern Territory,
away from Palmers-
ton, almost every-
body who travels has
an attendant black
sister. The attrac-
tion of the white for
the black lady is re-
markable. One East
Kimberley station
manager had 17
“attendants,” and
most station hands
have two or three.
As regards swapping
the girls: On the
stations the manager
names the wages to
an applicant, and a
gin is thrown in. A
man who travels
without an aide-de-
camp is looked upon
with suspicion as
either a wowser or a
person who has
lately committed
murder. At one time
I ran a pub in a small
mining settlement.
It took the scone.
Travellers w onld
arrive with their
aides and ask for
accom m odation.
Some wanted them
to sit at the table.
I was a 1 w ays in
trouble. The chief
topic of conversation
islubra. But barter-
ing is the limit. One
man wanted to swap
his consort for a
bottle of rum ; and
another said he
would sell his for
two shillings. The
old blacks do a roar-
ing trade in girls.
It is quite common
to see a nigger travel-
ling with four or five.
These are sold to Chinese and
whites alike. When you arrive at a camp
the first question is, “Where’s your gin?” But
the station people have now discarded the black
for the yellow (half-caste) variety. Altogether,
the black question in the Territory is a festering
sore, and the way girl children are sold into
slavery is a national disgrace.

“ Hermes” : Apropos the N.S.W. Govern-
ment’s intention to build railways where and
when possible by
day labor, and the
S. ’M. Herald’s
pained surprise
in consequence.
Writer was once
in a train on
which the driver
had got drunk on
boiled Benedict-
ine and gone tem-
porarily mad. Be-
lieving that the
fiend was after
the manager, the
driver attempted
to save him by
putting the train
at the top speed
he could get out
of the engine,
which was about
54 miles an hour.
The chief en-
gineer was on board. Immediately the situa-
tion transpired he inquired : “How was this
line built —by our own men or a contractor?”
“By a contractor, sir.” “Then we’re done!”
said the engineer; and there and then, re-
gardless of appearances, he slipped down on his
knees and prayed—prayed openly and hard.
I’ve never believed in contract railway build-
ing since then. We got through ; but that
was, no doubt, owing to the fact that the line had
been reconstructed by the railway men on day
wages.

ITS EFFECT ON WILLIAM.
THE WOWSEBESS: “ The curses of drink are
terrible! ”
THE EVERYDAY FEMALE: “ Yes, some of ’em do ;
but my Bill always gets speechless"
Port Adelaide had a mysterious Christmas
tragedy. William Battye was a man of 32, in
business with his brother, happily married, and
seemingly without a care in the world. At 10.30
p.m. he was chatting to his brother on his own
doorstep. At 1 a.m. his house was on fire. The
brigade found nothing much burnt except the bed,
and on that were Battye’s wife and child, with their
heads battered in—apparently with a lemonade
bottle. In the morning, the house-father himself
was found in the docks near by, badly burnt, nearly
nude, and dead by drowning. There the matter
rests. That any outsider killed the three of them
is unlikely. To say that Battye went mad and
did the deed—just because he had once had
deiigue fever in Queensland, and with no evidence
—would be (said the coroner) to “ introduce chaos
into all criminal proceedings.” So it was recorded
officially that all three are dead.
A very remarkable affair in the way of
letter-writing was the epistle of Tommy Hoy,
who hanged himself in the lockup at Albury
(N.S.W.) last week. The document commenced
“Dear Gaol.”

What are the wowsers doing ? At a wood-
chopping contest at Horsham (Vic.) one of the
backers of the winning axeman rushed to pat the
hero on the back when he was delivering his final
chop. The interloper’s right arm got into the
line of stroke and was nearly chopped off just
below the shoulder. Yet not a wowser has been
heard agitating for the suppression of wood-
chopping matches. Has Judkins lost his punch,
or what ?

“Rooinek”: The South African Govern-
ment did for Fisher and his party what
the Australian Government could not do
for any party of distinguished visitors. That
is, it provided them with a couple of
sumptuous corridor saloons, in which they
were able to enjoy all the comforts of a good
hotel and travel at will over every province of the
Union. For one thing, the Australian Govern-
ment doesn’t own the railways ; and for another
thing, the breaks of gauge would necessitate a
number of trains instead of one, with continual
turning-out and re-arranging of luggage, etc.
Fisher’s outfit included dining, sleeping and
observation compartments, and a cook and steward
were told off specially to accompany them. With
Fowlds, of M.L., and Ambrose Pratt and M‘Cay,
Australian journalists, the Prime Minister lived
on that train for a fortnight, and seemed reluctant
to leave it. I heard Fisher at a banquet inviting
S’Africans to come to Australia, and assuring
them of a warm Australian welcome. But, as an
Australian, I almost blushed to think of the rail-
ways we should show them, with their multi-
tudinous gauges and their antiquated equipment.
# *
An unexpected development the other
day was the beginning of an agitation among the
people of Queanbeyan (N.S.W.) to have the
Federal capital territory enlarged so as to include
their town. If adjacent N.S.W. towns begin to
struggle desperately for inclusion in the Federal
area, that area may become a very large place one
of these days. The movement is at least under-
standable. The area inside the Federal capital
boundary will be subsidised by the money of
Queensland, N.S.W., Victoria, Tasmania, S.’A.
and Westralia. It will be the one glad spot in
Australia which will have six States to help
make its roads and bridges, and to fix up its
drains and water supply, and to pay for beautifi-
cation and adornment. If King O’Malley builds
the City Beautiful about which he speaks so
eloquently’ through his nose, and sometimes
through his hat, there will presumably be a great
cleaning up and repairing of any adjacent towns
that are included in the territory, to make them
correspond with the metropolis, and that is
always a pleasant circumstance. Being inside
the territory will mean having tramway communi-
cation with the capital, while being outside will
mean getting there with the aid of Dobbin in the
old spring cart. And there are other possible
advantages which Queanbeyan doubtless per-
ceives, so that settlement is resolved to get in
early.
HEAVILY HANDICAPPED.
POPPER: “Hurry up, Amelia! If we run we
might catch it.”
Melbourne City Council is an intelligent
body—one might almost call it intellectual. It
took barely two years to draw up a set of by-laws
dealing with taxi-cabs, and then it provided that
the hire of the vehicles should beat the rate of Is.
a mile, or 6s. per hour. This was done to suit the
vested interests of the owners of horse-drawn
cabs ; but as the whole essence and advantage of
a taxi-cab is that you pay by the mile, the taxi-
owners simply decline to put their carriages on
the ranks at all. Which was probably just what
the antediluvian councillors wanted.
A THANKSGIVING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
It is over, thank God, it is over—
From the Ham they have sliced the last shred.
And the bone has been given to Rover,
Who sleeps with it under my bed.
They have done with the paste and the puffing 1 ,
With the pudding and jelly and muck ;
They have thrown out the last of the stuffing 1 ,
And buried the end of the duck.
The Christmas Bush, dried up and broken,
’Neath the gasolier mournfully waves.
It reminds me of some loving 1 token
One sees on the summit of graves ;
And the flies wander drearily o’er it,
And murmur a dirge as they go.
Vile emblem-of Feed—l abhor it;

HORACE HALLORAN.
A HURRIED FAREWELL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I lost all acute consciousness of self and surroundings.
The Stone Age savage rose and demanded blood —Papke’s
blood. Whenever Smith hit him in the face—which was
fairlv often —I gasped with pleasure, and the harder the
blow the greater the joy it caused. A good heavy thump
on that hard, white body also provoked pleasurable sen-
sations in me, but the smashing face blows were the best,
... We had been back in the Age of the Flint Axe, under
the naked, everlasting stars, in touch with the root of
human nature, if only for three-quarters of an hour, and
we emerged refreshed to face conventions, civilisation
and electric trams with a new courage.— Dulcie Learner,
writing of the Smith-Papke fight, in Sydney Sunday Sun.
“ I am unworthy 1 ” cried the youth,
And gathered up his roses.
“ Dear, hear me tell the shameful truth 1
In no graveyard reposes
A victim to my six-ounce glove !
So there can be no bridal 1
Farewell ! My tendencies, dear love,
Were never homicidal !
I’ve never thumped my fellow-man,
Or shed the vital fluid !
Forgive me, darling, if you can !
Had I but been a Druid,
Or something of the Age of Mud
(Of which Jack London proses),
I could have brought you foeman’s blood
Instead of sweets and roses !

After the crushing defeat Mr. Deakin received at the

tongue, but the Macrocephalous instinct has agiin given
birth to a monstremata in the shape of a manifesto.

How hollow is this Empire talk—this
prattle about dear old England being ready to
help us out of any war-trouble that may hit us.
from motives quite unconnected with the British
moneylender! The officers of the Gibraltar,
which convoyed the two Australian destroyers
from the Cold Country, had turned down the
“ Colonial ” officers of the Yarra and Parramatta
long before Australia was sighted, and at Broome
the position was acute. The Gibraltar’s men and
the Australians fraternised gladly enough, but
the British officers had no time for the Aus-
tralians. Yet any cheap politician who is pre-
pared to yap about brotherhood and the beauty of
the love borne us by the dear old Mother Country
can have his prattle reported to the length of a
column or more.

The promise of a cheap fish supply for
Melbourne is hazy at present. A syndicate, it is
said, has bought a vessel which will trail its
trawling gear “ in waters east of Tasmania,” and
have a depdt ashore for the supply of fish direct
to the public. But the syndicate didn’t need to
make a commercial start by catching its own fish.
It might have got tons of fish from men already
in the business. What Melbourne wants isn’t so
much more fishermen, or even more fish, as a
simple system of distribution from depots; and
the purchase of a trawler before a new system of
supply and demand has been established seems
like tackling the problem from the wrong end.
JUST THE IDEA!
UNCLE WOUZER: “ What you require, my dear,

The concert-hall which is to go up for the
Tints in Collins-street, Melbourne, will replace
the old Presbyterian Assembly Hall. That will
be the second “ degradation ” the place has had.
It was formerly St. Enoch’s Church, and has the
pretence of a bluestone front and a white spire,
though the hidden back is only mean brick. The
front and spire were stuck on in rivalry of the
Scots Church opposite. Over half a century ago
Melbourne had three rival sets of fiercely-battling
Presbyterians. There was Hetherington’s Scots
Church ; and Ramsay’s St. Enoch’s, which stood
for the “United ” church party ; and Chalmers’s,
at East Melbourne, where Cairns held up the
“Free ” Church. Cairns was a particularly bitter
enemy of “Rome”; but the time came when
“Rome” bought his church, pulled it down and
built the stones into a convent hard by—which
was a sweet revenge ! The three Presbyterian
sects in the end combined, and St. Enoch’s was
turned into a mere Assembly Hall.
The Melbourne Tramway Octopus is glar-
ing at the lately-born Association of Tramway
Men, and saying things under its breath. It has,
for example, issued a circular, intimating'
in velvety language that the company
may discontinue its habit of paying half
the members’ subscriptions—a whole
per week—to the employees’ Benefit
(Society if members of the new organisa-
tion are allowed to remain inthe older
society. From which it will be gathered
that the company is waiting to aim a
clod at the new combination as well as a
brick at the principle of unionism. Still,
the men may even resist a bribe of
per week when they remember that the
Arbitration Court will probably argue
that, if the poor co. could afford to put
all that money into the men’s left-hand
pocket, it can also afford to put it into
their right-hand pocket. No Arbitration
body is at all likely to allow men to be
penalised for submitting themselves to its
jurisdiction; wherefore the men need
worry much less about the brick than the
co. itself very reasonably might. Some-
how, nearly every brick aimed by the co.
nowadays turns itself into a boomerang
before it has finished its job, and bashes
the co. dreadfully.

The Council of Churches in Mel-
bourne has started a crusade against the
practice of conducting “frivolous conversa-
tions ”on the Sabbath. It is not an example
of charity beginning at home, for the agita-
tion is not aimed at incompetent parsons at
all ; its object is merely to minimise the
Sunday use of telephones. The Council of
Churches asked Act ng-Premier Hughes for
“a silent Sunday”—which is precisely what a
large majority of Melbourne residents are
pleading for at the hands of the pastors and
spiritual masters composing the Council of
Churches. When the church bells have been
rung off in the interests of a silent Sunday, the
parsons may with some reason ask Hughes to
silence the telephone bell.

Departed from Port Jackson on Christ-
mas Eve, H.M.S. Gibraltar with a shipment of
time-expired ratings who have had their allow-
ance of “ colonial experience.” There was much
lamentation afloat and ashore that the departing
Jacks were not allowed a few more hours in port
so that they might spend Christmas with the
girls they’ve left behind them. But prayers and
entreaties were alike unavailing. The movements
of the British navy are made to suit the British
navy, and all the festivals of Christendom will not
serve as an anchor for even one gunboat when the
sailing orders pipe to capstan. So at midday on
Christmas Eve the Gibraltar dropped down the
bay with the homeward-bound pennant stream-
ing on the breeze, and the tears of Emily and Lou
streaming on the quay.
“ Silas Snell ” : I went out into the wild-
woods on Boxing Day with a large party, ham-
pered with loads and loaded with hampers, seek-
ing bush experience, snake stories, cow adven-
tures, and other “ Aboriginalities.” We got into
the thick of the nearest thing to pristine wilder-
ness that a os. Bd. railway journey from Melbourne
can supply, and discovered a previous picnic
party, much mote hampered than ourselves, and
fraternised. The other push had a swagger accent
and English ideas. I noticed something like a
hag of spuds leaning against a tree, and investi-
gated. Before heaven, it was a bag of coal! In-
quiries elicited this delicious heart throb : “Oh,
yes, we were determined to be real Australian
bushman, you know. That is some coal for boil-
ing the billy ! ”
“ 10-2-4 ” on the Silence of the Wowser :
The wowser has a strange faculty for missing the right
moment to sound the tocsin of protest.
The other month there was some talk of showing the
Jeffries-Johnson fight pictures in Sydney. The world’s
verdict, as expressed by such eminently righteous papers
as London Times and New York that
there was nothing debasing about the flicker view of the
Reno disturbance. The dim presentment of a stout,
elderly-looking Caucasian wrestling with a large, affable
nigger, and then subsiding noiselessly on the ground,
as a preliminary to fading right off the sheet,
was not reckoned likely to stir any baser passions.
Yet, at the prospect of that innocuous spectacle, Wow-
serdom arose as one snuffler and protested so hard that
the Reno picture was held over till public interest in it
was moribund. After the Burns-Johnson fight—a fairly-
conducted and by no means ultra-gory fray—the person
with the monkey-shave yelped so deafeningly that the
Wade Government hastened to make regulations which,
according to Chief Secretary Wood, were destined to
make fights as bloodless and edifying as golf matches.
During the past couple of months the Sydney Stadium
has been exploiting a team of Yankee pugilists. With
one doubtful exception the imports can’t box for sour
fruit. Their strong suits are an animal-like capacity for
taking punishment, a wild swing that is liable to finish up
anywhere from the surrounding atmosphere to the pit of
the referee’s stomach, and a talent for “pointing” that
amounts to genius. Papke, the alleged middle-weight, is
a heavy-weight. “ Cyclone ” Thompson, who got a
match with Hughie Mehegan under the pretence that he
was a light-weight, and who smashed plucky little
Unholz into unconsciousness in what the Stadium humor-
ists described as “a light-weight contest,” turned out
when publicly weighed at the ringside to he a heavy-
weight. Papke fouled Dave Smith. Another of the
tribe, disapproving of “Snowy ” Baker’s refereeing, used
language which would have earned a mere wharf lumper
a term in gaol. And so on.
As a result of all ttiese things, the Stadium has de-
veloped into a raging inferno of blanky wild words and
ready stoush. Sydney Telegraph, which so virtuously
denounced the Burns-Johnson upheaval, describes how
“ for 19 rounds, Land and Thompson fought like tiger-
cats in a rage.” And it dwells almost lovingly on the
hoots, the yells and the promiscuous disturbances. Yet,
up to the time of writing, the astounding wowser has nor.
said a word.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was a merry morn in spring, and merry sang the
breeze ;
It sang a tale of budding love to all the bending trees ;
It sang a tale of blighted love that ended like a sigh—
“ God help the little Buttercup that Kissed the Butter-
fly ! ”
“ Ye know the giddy Butterfly, the orange on his wings;
Ye know how little cares the wight who listens when he
sings;
Ye wot he hath a leman fair in ev’rv garden nigh—
And now the little Buttercup hath Kissed the Butterfly!
“She grew a simple, trusting flower beyond the garden
pale ;
She never listed yet to them that tell the glozing tale ;
But young and pure she knew no lure —and when he
floated by—
Ileav’n help the little Buttercup, she Kissed the Butter-
fly 1
“ But he hath joys are fled ; he dips in yonder
rose
Who nOw exhales k perfume rare to bless huh as he goes ;
Why should he turn to look and learn how wilding-
blossoms die—
God help the little Buttercup that Kissed the Butterfly !’*

F.B.
THE FALL OF MAN: REVISED VERSION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Church, having taken to food reform and teetot.al-
ism, grows very discontented with the orthodox account
of the fall of Adam. One Melb. anti-meat-eating minister
declares his belief that it was not an apple Eve gave
Adam, but a mutton chop. Another, whose particular
fad is teetotalism, says he is sure it was not an apple in
its simple, natural state that brought abodt the fall of
man. Our own belief is than it. was not a serpent, but a
worm, that led to the original sin.
The moving tale of Adam’s fate
And Eve’s profane excursion
Is not entirely up-to-date ;
We need a modern version.
Eve, Adam and the Devil, they
Get their deserts ; but here to-day
In every church and chapel,
The texts undoubtedly convey
Injustice to the apple.
The apple is a guileless thing
When ripe and round and mellow;
We can’t believe that it would bring
A fall to any fellow.
Eve’s name w'as Hebe, and her plan
Was much more deep and sinful than
The one the Scriptures lead in.
In fact, the wily Devil ran
A private still in Eden.
Eve took the apples from the tree,
And to old Nick she hied her ;
They brewed in secret two or three
Fat little kegs of cider.
Eve gave to Adam (so we think)
A pipkin straight, and he did drink.
So apples, worm and madam
In fatal combination link
To fix the fall of Adam !
VICTORIA.

“Chloe,” to “Celia Lloyd” (B. 24/11/TO) :
Re the “ dirty, dangerous hit of Nor’-West Australia,”
let me say a word to “Celia” about the pearler, of
whom she knows so little, and deny absolutely and
emphatically that the pearler is wanting in grit, and that
he lets the Japs run the industry. The .Japashore does
run the business houses of Broome ; afloat, both Japs
and Malays are pretty quickly taught their places when
teaching is required.
The Jap or Malay diver gets his billet because he knows
all there is to know about sailing, and shell gathering,
and the best grounds for conducting operations. The
white lugger-master, in many cases, has had no previ-
ous experience of the sea, but is, and has to be,'master of
that boat, and pretty quickly lets his diver and tender
know that their business is to pick grounds and dive ;
and in nine cases out of ten the diver is as anxious as the
lugger-master to have discipline. Trouble, no doubt,
begins if the divers’ sailing orders are unduly interfered
with; and such interference is most unbusiness-like.
But let either diver or tender exceed his authority, and I
guess there isn’t a white man at the game who doesn’t
know how to give the offenders a set-back.
Now that the pearling industry is getting by degrees
away from the Jewish and Jap firms which hoped to run
the business (and did for a while), it is only the gritty men
who keep at it. And while there are men at the game
like the Chamberlain Bros., not forgetting good old Cap-
tain Lee, Gregory Bros., Francis, Owen and others, don’t
talk of grit being wanted, because it isn’t fair to men
who are too busy to say much for themselves. I also
have lived in a pearling community, and though I allow
none of those I have named are reaching out for the
halos of saints, they are the men who will be wanted if it
ever comes to a struggle with the Japs. And, what is
more, I believe the Japs would have been in long ago if
it hadn’t been for the effect Wrought on the Jap mind by
the steadiness and cool couratre of the pearlers. So here’s
niy best of good wishes to them, and a lot of sympathy in
the losses and sorrows which they take like men, and
good, gritty Australian men at that.
MATES: A MAE AMO A IDYLL.
BILL carries the swag,

A N ENTRA-SIZE.
FAIR AMERICAN: "Nay, reckon you beat us on rabbits.”
“Puketapu”: I was moving down the
west coast of the South Island of M,L. when I
met the Ca.sual Gravedigger. It was a warm day,
and as I leaned over the fence of the old, dilapi-
dated burying-place I observed a whirl of smoke
rise from behind a near-by mound. Thinking
that the Devil’s kitchen chimney must be on fire,
I walked round to offer my assistance, only
to find myself confronted with a wizened
old party who was splitting a wooden
head-slab with a spade and feeding a
fire upon which rested a blackened billy.
“G’day,” he remarked casually; “yer jest in
time for a swig ev tea. Y’ can’t beat tea when
y’ve bin sinkin’ boles like that one” (pointing to a
gaping grave) “in wehther like this.” He stirred
the fire with his foot as he spoke, and I moved
back from a shower of sparks. “ Yes,” he said in
answer to my movement, “that’s the worst ev
that d d totara ; it sparks like blazes. Still,
y’ can’t git nothin’ better fer coffins. That there
bit ev timber we’re a burnin’ was put round ole
Bill Jackson Gord knows’ow many years ergo, and
it’s as sound now as the day it wuz lammed home.
For why did I split it up? Well, it wuz handy,
and it ain’t no manner o’ good to Bill. He don’t
want no firin’ where ’e’s gone ; not if I know ’im.”
After having a pannikin of tea—and it didn’t
taste any the worse for the way it was brewed—l
asked the casual sexton how long totara would
last underground. “ Now yer aistin’ something,”
was his answer. “It’s ’aid to say, but I reckon
a good coffin ev that there wood in. a
well-dug ’ole oughter larst a bloke till
tli’ Day ev Judgment. Sometimes I think
that there’ll be a nice few corpses will miss tli’ ’bus
owin’to not being able to git outer their cases.”
Just then I saw a dismal little procession winding
slowly down the dusty incline. The Casual Grave •
digger saw it at the same time, and, rising from
the mound on which he was reclining, he stamped
the fire out and scattered the ashes. Then he
swilled the tea-dregs round the bottom of the
billy and threw them into the newly-carved grave.
“ Here comes th’ larst of pore ole ’Arry Clarke,”
he said ; “ Vs got a fine day for it, ain’t ’e?”
* •» * *
“Gil Gunnia ” : Two scribes flatly con-
tradict one another in the same issue (B. 1/12/TO)
re gidya trees and ants. “ MinaritcFiee” says
the gidya is evil-smelling and repels ants (a
great consideration when Jimhiil is on the track) ;
while “M.,” in describing a mix-up between two
parties of ants, states that while camped in a
gidya scrub he and his mates were almost driven
niad by the infernal attention of ants. Will the
Religious Editor kindly give an opinion and
settle the question ? [The Religious Editor is of
opinion that the ants mentioned by “M.” had
been considering the administration of Justice by
the late N.S.W. Government, and naturally
wouldn’t have noticed even a dead whale if it
had been in the neighborhood.—Ed. B.]
* * * *
“Agricola”: How about this for bush
surgery? Picked up a defunct magpiejl who
had been experimenting with an overdose of
phosphorus. On examination I found that
his off-side leg had been broken, as by a
rabbit trap. The break had been patched up and
skilfully splinted* or rather spliced, by means
of feathers tightly twisted round the leg, and
glued on by the clotting of the blood. The
feather bandages bad been provided by the bird
itself, and had been plucked, from the longer
breast feathers, which were pliant enough to be
twisted round the leg easily. The wounded limb
was twice as big as the sound one, on account of
the quantity of wrapping. The bone was knitting
well, and in a,few weeks it would have been as
sound as ever. Probably the difficulty of obtain-
ing food had led the invalid to absorb the phos-
phorus bait, and I move a motion of want of con-
fidence in the hard luck that struck that feathered
surgeon.
“1.N.”: Speaking as the nightly occu-
pant of a tent in close proximity to Melbourne
Zoo, at Royal Park, I make bold to say that the
female ass makes
the most irisomm-
ating noise of any
animal on earth.
People at a dis-
tance may be most-
ly troubled by the
far-reaching roars
of lions and other
beasts of prey ; but
I find language in-
adequate only as
regards the lady
donkey. In moon-
shine, or in utter
darkness alike, she
starts to sing at 11
p. m. or earlier,
and her recital
lasts for hours, on
and off. Every
verse ends with a
top note which
breaks into varia-
tions. One,of these
nights, when I can
steal out in my py-
jamas without dis-
turbing any fond
couples dotted on
the green sward
thereabouts, I will
endeavor to slay that donkey. If ever she is
found dead with bullets in her middle regis-
ter, the missiles will be mine. Surely a per-
forming ass isn’t wanted in a Zoo. It isn’t a
circus.
* * * *
“Gip”: We had everything hut bees,
and we decided that the place would not be truly
rural till we had them too. So we got them, and
all was well—till the arrival of the ants to collect
the honey. I didn’t think there were so many
ants in the world. They came in millions,
blackening the hive with their massed bodies and
r.usliing the door in squads, heaps and battalions.
The bees threw down their tools, and the hum of
war died only when darkness called “ half-
time.” We tied kerosene-soaked rags round
the legs of the bees’ residence; but as soon
as they dried a bit up went the determined
black millions again. Then a man told
us that ants had never been known to cross tar ;
so we plastered it on regardless of cost. . By-and-
bye it dried also, and the ant commandant ordered
another assault. We tried rabbit fur. No good.
Finally, in desperation, we placed the legs of the
stand in four soup plates full of water, and at
present the ants are sitting round thinking. I’ll
bet they’ll get over somehow, even if a billion
or so have to be sacrificed to form a bridge for
the others. Somebody advised me to make a
paste of sugar and borax and place it above
the ants’ nest, and I’nr going ' to do it.
I’d make a paste of fried whiskers if
I thought it would do any good. Meanwhile can
any nice aboriginal man tell me something—a dead
sure-as-sure something—to keep the bees safe.
What with aphis, mildew, red spider, ants, straw-
berry beetle, pumpkin beetle, caterpillars, grubs,
grasshoppers and plain, spotted and variegated
bugs one can’t help agreeing with the other chap
who said that “life was just one thing after
another.”
“ Celiat Lloyd ” : long do you think
it will take for the Northern! River (N.S.W;)
cow-cocky to develop into a horned creature, wh6
will stand behind fences and nioo at you as you
pass? I reckon he is evoluting in that direction
at a fairly fast rate. Already he presents a bovine
appearance and a limited power of speech ; almost
the only words he can use freeh r are “cow,”
“bail-up,” “cream” and “butter,” though he
also says “How much?” very plainly. The
question with which I started C’tuses me many
sleepless nights, as some of the best friends I have
are working in butter, and I’m quite certain that,
when the cocky evolves horns, my friends—the
tester, at any rate—will be gored to death.
Taking the creamery job all round, it just means
313 underpaid days in the year, the 52 Sundays
being the only days off for the factory employee.
The working manager’s life is not worth mention-
ing; and for a straight-dinkum devil of a game
you may pass the tray to the tester. The cockies
roar and howl about losses and robbery, until the
much-worried tester, or whatever he is classed,
goes over the mark in trying to keep the peace.
The manager at the end of the rrionth then finds
that he has been paying for more butter than he
has been making, and he roars. Then the tester
brings boss-cocky to. his true level ; and, as the
boss-cocky is most likely a shareholder, and in
such case the manager’s boss, they roar at each
other, after which they both roar at the tester.

“ V. J’s. ” champion mean cuss :
He was an inveterate gambler ; but poverty and hard-
ship were his only winnings. His wife, like many
another plucky Australian woman, buckled to, and
managed to keep the family from the wolf. By the
strictest economy and self-sacrifice she had scraped to-
gether £4, and put it by to meet that emergency which
crowds upon us all just when we’re looking the other
way. But the mean, gambler knew of the little
hoarding, and his fingers itched t,o spin t lie money
on the wheel of CiVahce. As the annual race
day approached, he sorted out a few “dead
birds” and decided that by some means or other the
family nest egg must be placed under them to hatch.
He knew it was no good going to his wife to try and raise
the precious savings on the moribund-poultry proposal,
and he was almost giving up all hope of success when a
mean, dirty and brilliant, idea struck him. Having got
hold of a blank summons form, he filled it in with an
accusation against himself of smashing a shop window
while intoxicated, concluding with a claim for £4
damages. Forging a few bogus names, he showed the
document to his wife in consternation. “1 don’t know
what I’m to do,” he said. “ I haven’t a bean to settle it,
and it, means I will have to take it, our. in gaol. It’ll be a
disgrace for all of us. and I’ll lose my job.” Much dis-
tressed, and, like most women, horrified at the blue
paper, the wife handed over the few “hones” she had
salted away. Needless to add, the “dead birds” made a

EVADING THE LAW.
KINILY TRAMP (to gent busy doctoring his car):
“ It's all right, matey; yeh kin come out. lit

“ Pick ” : My entry for the friendly bush-
bird prize is the soldier, a little slate-colored,
yellow-gilled fellow, common in certain parts of
Monaro and the South Coast (N.S.W.) districts,
and owing bis name to bis pugnacity. He will
fight anything from a cockroach to a Tantanoola
tiger; and, unlike the thrush, fancied by recent
Abo. writers, be is not only interesting for bis
familiarity, but is useful to boot. The soldier
takes to a house, tent or gunyah as soon as one
appears on the landscape, and immediately
enters upon the duties of early alarm clock, and
sentinel to give warning when any snake,
gohanna, sundowner or other seventh day
creation is creeping upon the hen house. He
cleans up the table and floor after even' meal,
and. incidentally, will clean up the sugar basin ns
well, unless shooed outside with a broom. Hav-
ing an especial antipathy for any Cold Country
importation, he is regarded as a feathered blessing
by the Monaro farmers for the enthusiasm with
which he drives off English sparrows and star-
lings from grain and fruit crops. For these
reasons, the farmers and cockies quite cheerfully
put up with his troublesome and persistent
attempts to nest in their beards.
“J.T.T.”: What makes “ M.V.” (B.

question? What lias the rousie to do with the
matter ? He has no vote, and never had.
THE ARAB.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The arching neck and fiery eye
l’roclaiiued the Arab in his veins,
He saw ih dreams a burnished sky
O’er palm-set wa tes of Asian plains, 1
Black Syrian tents with ragged fringe,
The sun-parched desert rolling free,
And far blue mountains that impinge
On lands of eldest mystery.
The languorous wind breathed low and ce sed,
It dropped its burden borne from far,
He snuffed the fragrance of the E ist
And whinnied to the western star.
Bush shadows hovered warm and brown
Filled with all voices of the night—
Some hand had left the sliprails down
No eye was near to mark his flight.
With quivering flank, and flying mane,
And freedom pricking like a spur,
II .■ galloped till the trackless plain
With dawn’s full pulse began to stir.
Behind him rose the fiery sun,
The grey lands glimmered like a sea—
No pause until the race be won
By the black tents of A rally.
The rocks of Hafiz, burnt and bain,,
Cast a lung shadow soft and grey ;
The kind-eye,tl black Bedawi marc
Whinnies to long-legged colts at play.
The red sun sank in clouds pf fire,
He stumbled on with rocking stride,
The deserts of his heart’s desire
Seemed spread before him waste and wide
Beneath the palms the waters gleam,
The airs are warm within the shade,
Where Arab steeds still love to dream
Of gallops in the border ('aid.
But when the desert stftrs a-bloom
Make all the skies of Hafiz gay,
With faint-heard whinny through the gloom
The.grey ghost-horses come to play.

“Itan” : Part of the expedition df bird
and beetle-hunters, which put in a few days on an
islet off Mackay (Q.), takes its second-best oath
that De Rougement’s yarn of a few years ago had
more gospel in it than most people supposed.
While the expedition ran riot on the beach, it
took to riding the turtles which lay tamely on the
sands. Directly the mount takes his seat he
must, it seems, be ready for a time of hilarity.
The turtle at once makes for the surf, and if his
head is not kept up he will go to the bottom.
Here is a chance for some enterprising individual
to get a few turtle for Manly and St. Kilda. A
man with some time on his hands could easily
bring down a team and save freight, riding one
and driving the rest tandem. But the object of
this par is to tell of a waybacker who rode a
Murray cod the other day at Narandera. No one
saw him do it ; but as he is a fisherman every-
body will take liis word for it. He had hooked a
GO-pounder which fought with great vigor for its
life. After tiring it out a bit, as he thought, the
fisherman got down in the water to land the prize.
With his arm thrust through the gills he tried to
climb the steep bank, but the fish upset calcula-
tions and sprang backwards. The pair went into
the deepwater with a swish. The fisherman’s
only chance was to stay in the saddle and keep
the fish’s head turned shorevvards. He did it, of
course, though he swears he will never ride an-
other without a snaffle.
“ The Pariah ” : Mighty dreary work is
that of the marram grass planters near the mouth
of the Aire, Cape Otway. The work has to be
done in the winter, and in that district each
winter week consists of eighr, wet days. The job
necessitates constant stooping, and the never-
resting wind swirls the sand into the eves, nose,
lips ana ears. Add to that occasional bursts of
sunshine on the.white sand, dazzling the already
tormented eyes. It has been decreed that the
marram shall be planted from the shore inland,
so that the drift may be arrested at its source.
Coming down to the Cape from Laver’s Hill
one could believe that the. landscape near
the Aire mouth was an immense vineyard.
The grass is planted in long parallel lines,
but it is a moot question whether it will arrest the
sand-drift, which is well up to an average height
of 60ft. I saw one instance of how the drift
advances. A section about a chain long puffed
outwards, and in a hissing cloud made a forward
move of about two chains. Eleven days after-
wards I passed the place. The wind had driven
so much sand into the gap that it was a scarcely
discernible undulation. But nothing so despair-
ingly marks the strength of the drift as the sight
of the upper branches of mighty blackbutts beat-
ing in the wind above the surface like ragged
haired giants fighting for breath.
SOUND REASONING.
BEERY BERTIE: “ Well, I'd like ter be over at
that Ball finch goldfield.”
RESTFUL REGINALD: “ Wot fer ? You wouldn't
go an lower yerself by workin ’ in a mine,
would yer! ”
BEERY BERTIE: “Not much! But I see tenter’s
scarce over there, and there's sure ter be pubs
and beer; and if a bloke was stranded they
couldn't let him die of thirst, could they?”
“L.H.” : The green turtle, though he is
so often in the soup, is not by any means such a
fool as he looks. Was camped on a Barrier island
awhile back, and on my arrival found that Mr.
and Mrs. Shellback came in to the beach to
canoodle and sun-hatcli in great numbers. One
or two were killed for food, the steak being very
excellent—something like a good fillet crossed
with a veal cutlet. Whether it was that we left
the offal about too freely in the water, and the
turtles smelt a rat, or whether they had a secret
service which reported our nefarious goings on, I
don’t know. What Ido know is that after a few
days they would not land on our beach at all,
though I counted 30 or 40 at a time inside the
lagoon at high water. Same thing killed the
turtle canning industry on North-West Island.
A Rockhampton meat-preserving firm erected a
plant there, and made turtle-soup—partly of
turtle. Things hummed for a while, but finally
the turtle refused any longer to come and be
canned, and the plant was shut down. Where-
upon the turtles came back in all their old
numerousness.
DISCREDITED.
SAM THE SOAK (who has fallen down a shaft and awoke to the conclusion that he must
be in Sheol): ,".It's all liesh about the boltomlesh pit. Ish gorra bottom all ri’, an’
a 'ard one, too.”
“Horatio B.” : I notice that Victorian
Governor Carmichael, whilst in the country re-
cently, showed a number of children how to feed
a mantis—the curious insect that resembles a
wowser without his umbrella. I saw a mantis
feeding himself the other morning; and if Car-
michael can do it any better, then he ought to be
slip and wicket-keeper in the next Test match.
When I first sighted him, the long, solemn,
armored thing was waiting with his front claws
devoutly folded. A venturesome flying insect
aeroplaned out of the hedge close by, alighted
three or four inches in front of the religious beast,
and started to clamber laboriously across a
blossom. The head of the mantis turned slightly ;
the guileless insect continued on its way ; then
suddenly, as I watched, it disappeared. 1 looked
at the mantis—which, I was prepared to swear,
had not moved or dropped one Amen. But there
was evidence to prove that he had. In the crook
of his right praying claw the dazed flying insect
was kicking his last; the mantis had already
bitten off his hind-legs and coat-tails. Now I
don’t see how it is possible for a mere Governor
to give a brute like that points on how to eat a
quick lunch. Seems to me that Carmichael might
do worse than sit back and allow the mantis to
show,him how to open bazaars like a lightning
flash. What a lot of time would be saved if a
mantis could be engaged to open Parliament 1

“ The Scapegoat ” : As my nomination of
the thrush as the champion of feathered friends
has passed unchallenged, I make hold to nomi-
nate the wagtail as champion for bravery, In
my hayshed roof, right up under the rafters, a
pair of wagtails built their home, and during the
recent hay-making William’s'Uinnoyance at being
disturbed was frank and to the point. As each
load of hay brought the stack nearer his sitting
wife, his rage increased; He swooped at each
forkful as it was tossed up, and eventually
attacked horses and men indiscriminately. A
space was carefully left for William and Wil-
hehnina’s entrance and exit, and they now have a
thriving family'; butby the way Billiam swaggers
round, it is clear that he reckons he saved all
their lives by hunting away a drove of giants.

“ Itan The saltbush, so long neglected
by squatterdom, is threatening to turn dog on
Australia. Although the season has been unpre-
cedentedly good out in the tract behind Broken
Hill, the saltbush is withering off as if struck by
a drought. There may be something in the yarrt
that the seasons have been so prolific that the
vegetable wants a spell, and is dying off to get it.
In other words, it walnts a drought— which it will
probably get if there is anything in the law of
averages. After the weather got tired of being
dry, seven or eight years ago, the salient resident
resuscitated itself just as if ithad riotously enjoyed
its state of suspended animation. The bluebush,
however, is Australia’s best drought-resisting
shrub. Mulga has been known to give up the
ghost during a thirsty spell, while bluebush hung
on to the raft. Even the gnawing of bunny at the
bark is defied. Myall and gidya are hardier than
mulga, but'they'haven’t the same feeding value.
“Agricola.”:. The youngest son of the
pub came up from the billabong the other even-
ing with a fine string of blackfish. YVe consumed
them at breakfast and rejoiced, and were exceed-
ing glad. For several evenings the hopeful pro-
duced a decent string, and bribes were showered
upon hini to induce him to discover his fishing-
hole. We went with him several times after
tea, and the total catch amounted to nil. Sus-
picion being aroused, he was tracked down one
afternoon to an entirely different spot, where, sus-
pended from a ti-tree branch a few feet above the
water, was a rabbit so totally defunct that it
advertised the fact for a considerable distance,
Herds of blowflies were camped on the advertise-
ment, and their immature offspring, dropped off
at frequent intervals, to the great joy and delecta-
tion of the fish. The boy baited with nothing.
The flop of the hook was enough to cause a rush,
and as the biggest and strongest of the fish were
in the orchestral stalls, he always secured, a good
sample. Blackfish were off next breakfast.

“fG-omerander ” : To “Mimosa” (B.
8/12/TO). I fiave a rosella that certainly knows—
I don’t say that he counts— up to four. It is my
practice to divide a small biscuit into four parts,
which I give him in succession. But sometimes,
for experiment, I withhold the last instalment,
and the result leaves no room for doubt that
Josephus considers himself a deeply-injured fowl.
He prances madly to and fro along his perch,
alternating frantic denunciations ,of breach-of-
contract with gentler lamentations over abuse of
confidence. Then he settles down and whistles
plaintively and appropriately “There’s Nae Good,
Luck.” But presently, when he is handed the
missing quarter, he returns thanks with “Larry
O’Qaff,” performed allegro con fuoco, which, I
understand, is Graeco-Roman for a devil of a row.
* * * *
“ Kowhai ” : Permit me to push some in-
formation into the current controversy anent the
Maori. “Hava’’and “feller ” are quite cornmqn
in the Maori vocabulary; and as for the’Maoris
squatting “on footpaths and in doorways, I’d
advise “Psyche” to take a trip to Hastings
(Hawkes Bay) and I guarantee he’d beeome
enlightened in less than half an hour. As for the
Maori buck being a worker, he is on two occa-
sions—(l)’when the boss is watching, and (2)
when, as in the shearing sheds, there are a few
wahines knocking roundJo encourage him to put
on a bit of “dorg.” But put him at fairly hard
work, “on his pat” and he’s a waster. Have seen
him fencing and grass-seed sowing
on the new land in the King Country, and have
invariably found him a pointer. On one occasion
I saw a Maori rip open several 801 b. bags of ,-seed
and tip them to the wind over the sides pf*a razor-,
back so as to save himself the labor of sowing
them in the usual way. As for the modesty of
the women, “Jack Jay” is merely proving his
pen-name. 1 The l only reason the little '“ half-
caste ” doesn’t appear as frequently as of yore is
because the Maori girls know more than they
used to.
“ YVhaffor ” : Re turtles on the north coast
of Australia. There are two ’ species—the
green turtle and the liawksbill. The former is
celebrated as the author of the far-famed
soup. The green turtle is specially distinguished
by its short beak, which is . devoid of a hook at
the tip, and by the shields being in contact at
their edges all through life. In color, the shell of
the adult is yellow or brown, with yellowish spots
or marblings ; while in the young it is uniform dark
brown or olive on top, and yellow underneath. The
green turtle’s food consistsof seaweeds. The hawks-
bill is not edible. It has beautifully-mottled,
horny shields, which are the sole source of the
tortoiseshell of commerce—such df it as isn’t imi-
tation. Some of these amphibians are of enor-
mous size. I saw one that weighed 2501 b
immense ungainly creature of great age. Shells
have brought as high as £4 each in Europe. Yet
there is no turtle industrjo One sea-turtle lays
from 140 to 150 eggs, which are hatched by natural
incubation in the sand. When fresh they are
better eating than hen eggs. The whole coast is
teeming with turtle, and Buchanan and Quail
Islands are where they hold their mass meetings.

“ Vigilans’s ” northern friend :
The most extraordinary reptile in the Commonwealth
is undoubtedly the frilled lizard of North Australia—the
solitary representative of its genus. It,attains a length of
35in., about 13 of which is tail. The species is at once
recognised by the curious frill surrounding the throat and
extending upwards to the sides of the nape. This tnem-
b ane has a serrated edge, is covered with scales of
larger size than those•'on the back; and recalls the Eliza-
bethan frills of our forgotten grandmothers. - In form the
body of the frilled lizard is slightly compressed, the
general color of the upper parts being pale brown, which
may be either uniform or mottled; The reptile favors sandy
districts, where it walks with a swinging gait on its hind
legs. When frightened it sits down on its hindquarters,
raises its forequarters and head as high as. possible,
strikes its body with its, tail and show's its teeth at the
intruder. The frill when extended forms a shield, con-
cealing the body, limbs and tail. It is one of > the gam eat
of the lizards,, and a great fighter. The blacks call it
“ Devil-devil,” and will not eat ir. I believe lam right in
saying that the wear, r of frills at the wrong end is to be
found only in the Far North.

“ Ha! Ha! Out for a day’s sport, were they?"
“ Curnbangaree ” : I would trouble you
to present my compliments to “Leo Lear” (B.
1/12/10), along with my observation that lie
doesn’t know much about termites’ nests and the
appropriation of same as lodgings for married
couples of birds. He would have us believe that
the white ants, the old man and Mrs. Jackass and
the kids occupy the one flat, with use of kitchen
common to both families. Rats! Every member
of the Muscicapidse (fly-catcher) and Halcyonidse
(kingfisher) families regards white ants as the
juiciest morsel of the menu. No sweet, milky,
little bit like them can be caught on the wing ;
and for this reason the elevated home of the ants
receives constant and vigorous attention, until the
whole colony is wiped out. ; Then, and only then,
does the bird rent the flat. The birds which 1
have most frequently found taking up residence in
the depopulated village'are the grey and the
speckled woodpecker; though, besides birds,
green snakes, ’possums, bats, squirrels and frogs
have made many a “shake down” in the white
ants’ gunyah.

—News item.
The black man stood upon a hill
Where smoked a city far and wide,
And flowed ’twixt house and raging mill
A never-ending human tide.
He saw the trains come streaming in,
The clash of iron beams he heard,
The strokes of piston and of gin,
The murmur of the alien word.
Here once the grateful forest spread,
The tribes took rest beneath the hill,
And Nature offered simple bread,
Sweet water and the beast to kill.
“ The tribes are gone. Their dust the rude
North wind is driving to the sea 1

John G. Cramond has got his name into
the Melbourne death-notices at the age of 79.
He reached Victoria in the ’so’s, but stuck to tape
and sundries instead of pursuing the uncertain
nugget; and he continued at the prosaic business
all his days—first in Lonsdale-street, then in
Warrnambool, and in later years as a director of
the heavily-gilded Melbourne firm of Ball and
Welch.

Robert Nall, news editor of the Sydney
Daily Telegraph, returns from a trip round the
world with better health and more experi-
ence, which is a first-class return for the
money invested. Like the average press-
man, who must write what he sees,
Nall turned his holiday into copy.
He tells one specially interesting
yarn about the liquor problem in
the United States. Very soon, he
thinks, most of the States will be
“dry.” Nevertheless, statistics
show that the Americans hold
their own as a drinking com-
munity, despite prohibition;
and he quotes Rear-Admiral
Evans, who “denounced pro-
hibition in the State of Maine,
because . . . his sailors when
they went into Portland were
poisoned by bad whisky, which
they had no difficulty in get-
ting, for oceans of intoxi-
cating liquors are obtainable
in Maine coast ports.” Alto-
gether, Nall decided that there
are worse places than N. S.
Wales, and he advises Aus-
tralian journalists to go and
see them. “Make a tour of
as much of the world as you
can cover,” he has been telling
his young men. “Go some-
time—the first chance for
choice.” So far, no announce-
ment has been made from the
manager’s department that a
year’s holiday on full pay may
be had on application.
J. W. Hackett, of the
Perth West Australian, had a

man who is trying to sell the Bull-frog West Ex-

The guests passed into the ballroom, which was arranged
like a large music-room, and in an alcove at the end stood
a perfect bower of waterlilies and roses, intermingled with
fern, arranged by |here followed the florist’s advt.], the
fairest flower of all being the little one who lay peacefully
sleeping, unconscious of all the admiration he was receiv-
ing. For certain it is that the baby is always the central
figure on such occasions, and little John Winthrop
Hackett was no exception to the rule.
Poor little John Winthrop Hackett, who takes so
early in life a lesson in the arts of advertising and
of canvassing for ads !
PUTTING HIS DOUBTS DELICATELY.
LANDLORD: “I hope you find the place sub-
stantial and in every way satisfactory.”
TENANT (doubtfully): “ Well, I always think it
safer to go outside to sneeze.”
Dankel, Labor M.P., who is a colleague of

Coney beer in the representation of Torrens (S. A.)
was christened George Casper Adolph Maria
Prosper by his loving parents. He has, however,
by official process ridded himself of all but one of
the prefixes, and friends may now simply call him
George without hurting his feelings.
The Australian climate gets an unsolicited
testimonial from Colonel Madley, till lately Ade-
laide’s Commissioner of Police. He went back to
his native Wales only a few months ago, intend-
ing there to end his days. But, having sampled
the Cold Country weather, and compared it with
what he had left behind him, he pulled up stakes
once more, and New Year’s Day saw him back in
the streets of Adelaide—for good this time, he
says.
Antonio de Travers, which sounds like
either a bag of bananas or a penn’orth of ice-
cream, is really the legal moniker of an Austrian
Count, who subsists humbly at Tallangatta (Vic.)
by carting firewood. The Count, who is the last
male sprout of his patrician tree, is locally an ob-
ject of all the more curiosity from the fact that he
is reported to be related to the House of Haps-
burg. The relationship, however, is admittedly
distant, and can only be perceived by the eye of
faith looking through a powerful glass.
The news that Manoel, late of Portugal, is
shortly going to wander round this way and pick
up points about the antique art of kingcraft, is ■
rather mystifying. Theatrical business has cer-
tainly been booming of late ; but Paris must still
have a big lead in chorus girls and dancers, judg-
ing by the quantity of Grand Dukes and such
who are round there on business. Justice will not
be done to this matter of greenroom government
until some tired comp, makes a Court Journal
solemnly remark that “ His Majesty left yester-
day for foreign tarts.”
There are still surviving four members of
the Chittleborough family who all came to S.A.
with the first Governor (Hindinarsh) in H.M.S.
Buffalo on Dec. 28, 1836. One of them played in
inter-State cricket for S.A., and he was for many
long years secretary of the Licensed Victuallers’
Association. He is a splendid advt. for the
healthiness of good liquor judiciously swallowed.
H. T. Morris, a nephew of the Governor, and a
fellow-passenger, also survives. Hindinarsh
fought at the battle of the Nile, and was thanked
by Nelson on the quarter-deck for saving the flag-
ship from being burnt, when the French L’Orient
caught fire. Morris was a well-grown youth
when he came to Adelaide with this interesting
uncle 74 years ago.
Douglas Mawson figures that the Aus-
tralian Antarctic Expedition which he is organ-
ising, to start perhaps at the end of 1911, will
cost £40,000; and £40,000, he allows, will take
some getting. The original idea was that
Shackleton should lead the party, with Mawson
as scientific director ; but as Shackleton has other
fish to grill, he has passed the whole thing on to
the Australian, and is giving him help at the
other end. Mawson’s present idea is to go almost
due south from Australia. There may be less
chance of reaching the South Pole that way ; but
he reckons that there is more scope thereabout
for scientific exploration.
“Brigadier” Bruntnell, who formerly
Hallelooyered for Booth and now Hallelooyersfor
Wade, has gone into business as a suburban
auctioneer and land agent. The firm evidently
intends to run things on - Hallelooyer principles ;
in its announcement it hopes that it will (d.v.)
be spared to knock things down for many years
to come.
Frank A. Nanldvell is holding a winter
exhibition of pictures in New York, and, accord-
ing to Boston Transcript and the talk of
American art journals, is making good even
better than before. Two or three tine portraits
are shown, but the big end of the exhibition is land-
scape and forest scenery. The Australian artist
does more picture work than Puck illustration
these days, and feels that he has' done enough
American subjects now to shortly entitle him to
an exhibition in Australia, and time to paint some
of the typical life of his own country.
The first letter that fell into The Bulle-
tin office this year came from Pine Creek, the
little township that hangs on to the end of the
railway line which started to hurry across Aus-
tralia from Port Darwin, and then stopped short
till a bigger man arrived to build it. “The
Northern Territory is Australia's now, and those
of us who are Australians want to give the Ter-
ritory all the lift we can. So we’re thinking of
starting a little paper. It won’t be much bigger
than a postage-stamp; but it can grow.” The
man behind the scheme is Dr. Abbott, Govern-
ment medical officer in those parts. He used to
be in Denial Bay, out in the West Coast of S.
Australia. That coast, which was marked down
as a desert, has become a big wheat-producer these
last few years ; and Abbott did a lot to bring that
change about. Yet all he had to do it with was a
small type-written sheet. The novelty of the
thing got the uaper quoted widely ; so, in the
end, he had a circulation of tens of thousands for
his whoops. This time he wants to go one better,
and get the thing printed ; but, if he can’t piint
it, the chances are he will write it—and The Bul-
letin gives him three cheers to go on with.
Frank Brown, a vigorous young Australian,
having some time on his hands and some few
pounds in his pockets, overlanded from
Bourke to Port Darwin last year with a
mate. On that trip they found something
that looked like a mine at Maroomba.
Brown frankly said he didn’t know a mine for
certain when he saw it; but he took in samples,
and they assayed w'ell enough. As it turned out
the mining man whom the Melbourne syndicate
sent up said it wasn’t a mine. But Brown wasn’t
finished with the Territory. He went back, and
roamed all over the north of it for six
months, and comes south again surer than
ever that it is going to do great things
when the markets are available. Some day,
he says, it ought to grow more pigs, for instance,
than ever Chicago packed. In some parts, where
a pair or two have somehow broken away and set
up housekeeping, there are now thousands—not
weeds, but fat, marketable pork. Judge Herbert,
who used to be Government Resident up that
way, has the same hopeful ideas on the pig ques-
tion ; which no doubt explains why, when he
transferred himself to Papua, he left two young
Herberts behind him on a stock-raising squattagf,
the stock being mainly the sort with a grunt
before and a curl behind.

One of the old-time Admirals of J. Bull’s
navy is Kennedy, K.C.8., at present on a trip
through Maoriland. This old salt butted into the
Crimea row as a midshipinite aboard the Rodney,
90-gun line-o’-battle ship, and saw the first and
last shot fired at Sebastopol. Subsequently he
was on service on the China station during the
argument which broke out in 1856, and smelt
much powder and saw much Pong. In thr*e days
the sailor-man was the most casual of Britain’s
assets. Reporting an incident on the Canton
River, where he shot through a door at a dis-
appearing Chinaman who had attempted to kill
him, Kennedy said
When the time came for us to retire, I went ashore,
and out of curiosity looked behind the door, when, 10, my
friend (Pong) was lying there dead. We then returned
to H.M.S, Barracouta to report proceedings and have
dinner.
A few years ago Admiral Kennedy retired from
the position of Commander-in-Chief at the Nore,
and at 65 years of age started out to enjoy life.
So he has taken a run down to Maoriland, some-
body having mentioned in his hearing that good-
sized trout are to be had there for the catching.
If the trout are not up to expectation, he proposes
to pack up for Sweden, where he knows his fish
to an ounce.
“LAWSON.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A correspondent in Melbourne Hrrald proposes that
the Federal capital should be called Lawson, in honor of
the Australian bard. The proposal is suggestive.
I took the train to Lawson,
Our Federal Capital,
Where shearers fill the shanties
And beer is brown and tall.
And on the road to Lawson
Some queer towns by the way
I saw, from Grover Alley
To porticoed McCrae.
Across the Hervey mulga
The car shot merrily,
And sighted Banjo Station,
And Outback Ogilvie.
It rattled on to Bedford,
A roaring mining camp ;
And Emerson, ’mid gum-trees
And pastures green and damp.
Romantic domes of Bayldon
Glowed in the sunset sky ;
Down new straight streets of Adams
I hear the train cars fly.
We passed Gay Brereton junction,
A classic, cultured town ;
We took in coal at Brennan—
French coal, symbolic, brown.
And coming close to Lawson
I paused for drinks within
That rolling seaport Brady,
Then sped to moonlit Quinn.
M‘Kay looked weird and starry,
The engine grunted loud ;
It shied at D. O’Reilly,
And broke down at O’Dowd.
And though we walked to Lawson,
The Federal capital,
Drovers and swaggies hailed us,
And beer was brown and tall.

This co. is in 193,037 shares of £1 each, having been
brought up to that figure through the taking over of the
Queensland Mercantile Co.’s business a few years ago.
The original Rich was a N.S.IV. back-country trader,
best known in the upper-Darling district. He sold
to an Australian co. in 1889, and some shockingly
bad years followed for the far-back country, and,
no doubt, also for this co. After nine years Dalgety’s
took a hand, and the head office was shifted to
Dalgety's offices in London. A period of careful nursing
followed; and that and the alrnost-magical recovery of
the N.S.NV. back-country apparently did such great
things for E. Rich and Co., Ltd., that a couple of years
ago the recuperated concern was led to Dalgety’s front
door and discharged, presumably cured. The head office
was then shifted back to Australia. Reserves are cer-
tainly still very small. But doubtless for a good
many years there were not only no reserves at all,
but really a deficit greater even than that disclosed
by the accounts. In 1904 there were book debts
amounting to £70,746 ; and if they had been severely
valued at that time, they might have had a good many
thousands lopped off them. The chances are that,
though the lopping was never done visibly, many a good
sovereign of profits made during the past few years has had
to go towards wiping out some of those old book debts.
Gradually the co. has relied less and less on the far-out
nrulga and saltbush, and more on a general trading
business. That has meant increasing stocks ; and as these
now represent £121,208, and as properties and plant run
to £36,696 and book debts (including bills) to £101,244,
it is obvious that the co. has to do some financing. The
total liabilities are £54,866. Compared with the share
capital that isn’t, however, very tremendous. From the
outside one can’t get much real idea as to the progress
the co. is making. One can only be sure that it ought to
have done very well indeed, and that its position
ought to be far sounder than it was a few years
ago; and the unhobblmg, so to speak, of the
co. supports the idea that it did what it ought
to have done. There is risk in the business,
of course : there is risk in every concern whose customers
are mainly engaged in the uncertain business of wheat
and wool harvesting. Those people mostly want credit;
when a wool-harvester wants to buy an earth scoop or
half a ton of fish-hooks, he can’t go and clip the surplus
wool from 100 or 1000 sheep that were shorn three or
four months before. If he ltasn’t got the cash, somebody
has to finance him. And at the end of the 12 months the
sheep may be dead. Generally, however, he is prepared to
pay pretty well for the accommodation ; so the co. that
obliges him can put something up its sleeve to meet the
cases in which the sheep have been disobliging enough
to die, and still show a good profit. Much depends on
how much a co. in this business has up its sleeve ; and
that is why one can’t always tell from the published
accounts what the real position of a co. like E. Rich and
Co. is.

The future of this co. lies in the lap of the gods, the gods
in this case being some old gentlemen, reputed to have
more experience than teeth, who sit now and then as the
Privy Council. The trouble is over the old question of
goodwill. The co. works under an Act which gives the
Perth City Council the power to acquire the undertaking.
When the time arrived for the City Council to speak, the
two parties found themselves at loggerheads. The City
Council said that it had only to pay for the works ; the
co. said it had to pay for the business as well —that
is to say, the people would have to pay for giving
themselves their own custom. Lawyers were consulted,
and of course one lot said one thing, and the other lot
said the other thing. Then came arbitration, and after
that the matter drifted on to the old gentlemen
in London. The amount offered by the coun-
cil was £158,866, or about 255. per share, whereas
two years ago, just before the clawing started, the
market valued the concern at over 50s. per share. That
presumably was for works and goodwill; and if that was
a fair valuation for the property, including goodwill, it
looks as though the co. expected to get about as much
for the thing that it couldn’t smell, or taste, or bruise its
nose against, as for those things that are visible and
tangible. So far as the trouble has gone, the City
Council has won ; the arbitrators said that the
valuation should be on the basis of the plant
in situ. The share quotation eased on that, but
there are buyers even now at about 39s.—which means
either strong faith that the Privy Council will jump the
other way, or that the works, etc., are much under-
valued in the co.’s books. The whole of the assets, less
liabilities, are equal to £1 11s. 3d. per share according to
the published accounts.
The co. supplies electric current as well as gas ;
in fact, the income from the former is more than double
that from the latter, and the net gas profit for the half-
year was £5769, while the other department showed
£13,555. Dividing the general assets among the two
departments in proportion to the capital specially
debited to each of them, the electric business shows a
net profit of about 22 per cent., while the gas gives about
16 per cent. Still, it isn’t likely that these things will be
of personal interest to the shareholders much longer.
Those who got in early have had an amazingly good time;
as the table shows, there have been terms when the
holders of contributing shares drew at the rate of 50 per
cent; per annum, though they certainly had to pay a
part of it back to the co. to wipe out their share
liability. But it is pretty safe to say that, on the lowest
possible valuation, they will fret every penny of it back.
The only people who possibly may fall into the soup are
those Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide men who didn’t
take the trouble to find out what the co.’s Act was
loaded with, and who bought from the guileless 'Groper
at 50s. and thereabouts.

This energetic co. has the mayor of Sydney for one
managing director and an ex-town clerk of Sydney for
another, and, to quote the articles, both “ shall remain
in office until they resign or die or are removed by special
resolution of the co.” As to shareholders’ voting power :
“ One vote for every 50 shares ; no member shall have
more than 100 votes.” As there are 100,000 shares
in the co. it should not be impossible to remove
the managing directors if such a thing should
ever become necessary or plainly advisable. Not
that there is the least suggestion of such a thing
now ; but where there are managing directors appointed
on these terms, the investor ought to satisfy himself that
the power of removal is real. No doubt there are ways
by which the limitation of votes to 10(3 can be got over.
But if a managing director holds so many shares that he
has to call in dummies to help him exercise his full vot-
ing strength, it is pretty certain that his interest
in the co. is large enough to make him at least
try to advance the co.’s interest. No doubt it
is possible for managing directors —or even directors who
are not managing directors—to fatten themselves while
starving the shareholders. Assuming that they have a
controlling vote, they can do it, for instance, by sucking
up the profits in salaries. In this case the salary is fixed
by the articles of the co.—a very proper thing in a case
of this kind. As far as can be seer., then, the interests
of the outside shareholder are satisfactorily protected.
The list at the top of this brief anniversary
address says that the profit for the half-year was £6605.
The published balance-sheet says it was £5635. The
difference is made up by additions to the insurance fund,
which is invested apart from the business —another
excellent feature of the co.’s financial methods. That
fund now amounts to £11,269. Including all assets
except book debts and similar non-combustible goods,
the total book value of the property is £51,298. The
insurance fund is therefore already very substantial,
especially when the comparative youth of the co. is
taken into account. Certainly, part of the rapid
growth is due to share premiums ; the business hasn’t
done it all. But it has apparently done very well in the
matter of providing for possible future knocks, though
exactly how well it has done can’t be told in the absence
of any hint as to the amount written off against depre-
ciation and wear and tear. The directors’ report says
that the profit is shown after “ full allowance for every-
thing- in the nature of bad and doubtful debts and the
usual appropriation for depreciation.” But what “ the
usual” is isn’t even whispered. This comparison only
gives a hint of it in one line :

It will be noticed that wharf properties four years ago
were valued at £15,900, and now they stand at only
£7OOO. Some certainly may have been sold, though there
is no mention of it; so it is more likely that the book-
value has been written down out of revenue. If
that practice has been followed to the same ex-
tent all through, then the co. must have been having
an amazingly good time, and its position must now be
extraordinarily solid. The one item at which the eye-
brows go up an inch or two is “Book debts, etc.,
£53,977”—0f which £36,532 is ordinary trade debts, as
against £17,841 twelve months ago. The turnover may,
no doubt, have increased vastly ; but that item needs
watching, for Sydney’s building boom may conceivably
come to a very sudden and very unpleasant end.

This isn’t plain sailing ; and the figures are not as abso-
lutely correct as they ought to be. The trouble is the
old one of lumped items. Thus “Depreciation of plant
and buildings” is lumped with “income-tax,” which is
unpardonable ; and “Amount written off book debts and
transferred to contingency reserve” is another mixed
item which shouldn’t be poured into one pot in that
fashion. In the table, the total which has disappeared
by way of these two items is shown as written off, though
of course bad debts and income tax ought to be deducted
from the profits and not shown first as profits at all.
Companies law is bad enough in most States in Aus-
tralia ; but in Maoriland it is far worse, with the result
that any old thing can be put forward there and called a
balance-sheet. The best that can be said for the present
accounts is that they are no worse than dozens of others
that come from across the Tasman Sea.
Eighteen months ago this co.’s position didn’t
strike The Bulletin very favorably, and it hasn’t im-
proved much in the meantime. The capital is £23,680,
including calls paid in advance, and the reserves are
£4116. The liabilities are £66,778. It is quite true that
some of the most solvent banks in the world have bor-
rowed six times the total amount of their own funds, and
this co.’s liabilities are not three times greater than the
funds. But the bank that didn’t keep nearly one-third of
all its deposit and other liabilities in cash or liquid assets, so
as to meet any sudden demand for repayment, would
come in for some strenuous language. This co., on the
other hand, has practically no cash or immediately-liquid
assets—not 1 per cent, of its liabilities. If it wants
money quickly to pay depositors, etc., it must either
depend upon calling it in from clients or rely upon the
bank for more overdraft. Of the total assets of £95,296,
advances represent £74,410. They may be perfectly
good. But perfectly good assets won’t always fetch 20s.
in the £ if they have to be realised whether the
market is favorable or unfavorable. The position is,
therefore, not as strong as it should be. There ought to
be more capital in the business; and even then there
possibly shouldn’t be as much trading, if it meant keep-
ing the safe as bare of cash and liquid assets. Getting
back for a few seconds to the table, it should perhaps be
explained that the accounts are for 18 months. A div.,
apparently at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum, was
paid for the second six months and 6 per cent, per annum
is to be paid for the .past six months.

The accounts don’t anywhere show the transaction re-
lating to the transfer of reserves to capital ; but as
£15,000 has fallen out of reserves and £15,000 has fallen
into capital, there is no doubt as to what has hap-
pened. The co. is partly a business and partly a
gambling concern. In 1909 it bought, and then
the price of wheat jumped, and flour, of course,
jumped too, and so a profit of nearly 80 per cent, on
the then capital of £15,000 was disclosed. This past
year the co. bought again ; but this time the wheat
market slumped, and then there was trouble. A country
mill, out towards the dead end of things, isn’t quite like
a mill at a seaport, or one a good way along the track
towards a seaport. The way-out country mill has to buy
early. If it doesn’t, the wheat from that district is
shipped away, and then the mill has to buy in other
parts, and drug the wheat out, and then drag the
flour back ; and all that dragging is bad business.
So the far-out country mill has to get practically all its
requirements early in the season, while the city or sea-
port mill, or the mill in towards the city or seaport, can
wait if the prices are hig-h at the start, and catch the
stuff as it comes through later on. The wheat-buying
business is a good deal of a gamble always ; for a co. like
this it is more of a gamble than usual. But though it
has had a comparatively bad year, the Young Co. had
got into such a wonderfully good position that it
reckons it can afford a 5 per cent, dividend,
equal to 10 per cent, on the actually-paid
capital ; and as it was fairly moderate in the extra good
years this paper will stretch a point and return a verdict
of “ Not guilty and don't do it again.” It softens its
heart in that way in consideration, among other things,
of the fact that the co.’s total liabilities are only £439,
while its liquid assets, mostly cash, amount to over
£24,000.

It is only a very moderately-profitable concern, consider-
ing the sort of concern it is. Certainly people who
invest in Consols don’t get 8 per cent. ; but there are not
quite the same risks about Consols. Also, this co.’s 8 per
cent, isn’t really 8 per cent., after all; for, after striking
a piece of bad luck or bad management a few years ago,
the co. had to write off more than half its capi-
tal. The piece of bad luck or bad manage-
ment in that case was embezzlement; and it
wasn’t the only time the co. has suffered that way.
It may be that the co has too many branches. There are
eight of them, besides the head office ; and £24,652—the
total of capital, reserves, deposits and overdraft—isn’t
very much to finance nine loan establishments. This
probably means poor salaries ; and poor salaries are apt
to be dangerous things in a business of this sort, where
the supervision can’t be very effective.

“ L.IL”: Grind to see that The Bulletin is not
allowing Wade’s Railway Superannuation business to
slumber undisturbed. When the scheme was first
announced, none of the men who really know anything
about pension schemes—and they are practically con-
fined to the actuarial departments of the life offices —
dreamed for a moment that it would be suffered to go
through. The thing was such a ludicrous financial and
actuarial impossibility that it was not taken seriously.
When it was finally made clear that the farce was to be
played right through, the actuaries of the insurance
offices found themselves in a hole. They had no
time to obtain expert opinion from outside. The
job was rushed through too quickly, for that. And they
realised that their own opinions, given in all good
faith and based on sound actuarial calculations, would
not have the same weight, inasmuch as all the offices
catered for the Railway Employees’ Assurance scheme,
and all stood to lose if this were replaced by a pension
scheme. Being staunch Liberals to a man, they knew
what Charles Gregory and his party were capable of in
the matter of fair criticism, so they shut up. But it
would have been better if they had braved the irate
accusations of self-interest which Wade would have
hurled. A little mud more or less would not have mat-
tered, especially if it had saved the Community from such
a patent political job. Before the thing goes another
step further the Government should appoint a Commis-
sion of actuarial experts to report on the wild scheme.

Hill Fisher and Son’s list shows that there are
very few Maoriland stocks that didn’t add something to
their market value last year. About the biggest rise
was in New Zealand Shipping Co.’s shares, which went
from £7 10s. to £ll 2s. 6d. This is an Anglo-Maoriland
concern, with two head-offices, two lots-of directors, and
the annual report and accounts are presented first in
London and then in Christchurch. The co. has a
big say in the Australian-Canadian line. Union
Steamship Co., whose £lO shares were worth £ll
15s. in 1900, has made further progress; the £1 shares
are now £1 16s. 6d. (= £lB ss. per £lO share),
and there has also been a 33J per cent, watering. The
share that was worth £ll 15s. in 1900 is thus worth
£24 6s. Bd. to-day. Fire insurance shares have moved
along slowly, but steadily. Gas have shown little change
for some years ; what movement there has been has been
upwards. The same applies to building and investment
shares. Meat preserving cos.’shares fluctuate ; last year
they moved up quickly. The Christchurch Co.’s stock
fattened fastest—£ll 2s. 6d. to £l5. Industrials held
their own, with a bit to the good in most cases.

The views of a mining engineer whom The
Bulletin is sometimes glad to consult: “The Bullfinch
Prop, is in an angle formed by the junction of the
granite and the hard greenstone. Its own country rock
is a schist. Near the granite, and running parallel, is a
hard bar ; and the Bullfinch’s rich ore is up against this.
There are five shafts. One, south of the others, found
gold. It was, therefore, supposed that it was on a par-
allel lode. Prospecting work from the shaft did not sup-
port that view. It now looks most likely that the
Bullfinch deposit is a boomerang-shaped lens, or a rounded-
off angle, conforming to the obtuse angle formed by the
junction of the granite and the greenstone. There may
be other lenses. At the back of the camp there is ore, as
mentioned last week ; but the outcrop is not of the same
character as that capping the main lens. The value of
the capping of this second body is variously stated at
from 6dwt. to loz. As a matter of fact, it has probably
never been thoroughly sampled.
“No other claim on the field has the same con-
ditions as the Bullfinch, because no other can be in the
same angle. There may, for all that, be other lenses;
and it is possible that they do not show outcrops.
Attention has so far been mainly directed to the out-
crops that are actually showing. These are mostly very
hard and not promising. If there ever were others, the
best of them have probably eroded. That, no doubt,
occurred at the Bullfinch, where the erosion left the gold
in the surrounding loam. This adds to the difficulty of
prospecting. On the other band, there is no very strong
reason to believe that such eroded outcrops are
numerous.
“A careful inspection discloses no values on the
Chaffinch. Yet there is no doubt that gold was got,
though opinion is divided as to how it came there. Look-
ing at the ground now, one sees no reason why the gold
should have been there. After the smash, a detective
was sent up from Perth. He seems to have dismissed
the salting theory, and turned his attention to the
question whether there was a ‘ bear conspiracy.’ There
is no doubt whatever that many wires were sent
from the field discrediting the rich find. Men
who had gone over the ground could see no
reason to expect values, rich or otherwise, and
when a very rich patch was found they offered the
easiest explanation—salt. The question perhaps never
will be thoroughly cleared up. All that can be said now
is that, while it is practically certain that nothing what-
ever will be got in the claims in the granite to the east of
the Bullfinch, it is less likely that mines will be found in
the hard greenstone than in the comparatively
soft schist. In this matter, theory is to some
extent supported by experience. Nothing, at any
rate, has yet been found in the greenstone on
the Bullfinch field, while the Bullfinch itself is in the
schist. The Chaffinch is in the greenstone. At the
same time, if gold is found in the greenstone, the
Chaffinch is very well situated ; for there is gold in the
Bullfinch—very rich gold—and the Chaffinch is next door.
“The Bull Ant is in the schist. A little gold
has been found in this claim, hut in a narrow vein so far,
though the surrounding schist also carries gold. The
body bears no resemblance to that of the Bullfinch Prop.,
and there is no reason to suspect that it is of the same
character. Of the rest it can be said in general that
they have so far got nothing. If the Bullfinch lens
goes out of the Doolette ranch, it has yet to be
found. The chances are that it doesn’t go out. And if
there are similai lenses they have yet to be found. It is
no use sinking shafts to find them. A very little work
will show whether the outcrops are worth anything or
not. For the rest, trenching at comparatively little ex-
pense will show whether there are eroded outcrops.
When that is done, and if nothing is found, there are two
courses open—either liquidation or the testing of some
of the-low-grade mines which live in the Southern Cross
district. Shareholders should see that the money isn’t
wasted.”
* * * *
The last fortnight’s crushing from the Bullfinch
—exemption began on 17th December—was 265 tons for
33900 z., worth £14,400. That made a total of 965 tons for
10,3750 z., worth £43,563.
The Bullfinch Miner’s view of the matter :
“While it vindicates Mr. Greenway, it is obvious that
Mr. Grut’s report suggests that the Chaffinch was salted.
The metallurgical expert does not say so in as many
words, nor do we. But it looks that way, and for the
fair fame and good name of the Bullfinch field generally,
for the sake of Yilgarn and the mining industry of the
whole State, all engaged in mining must welcome the
official announcement that Warden Finnerty is to hold
an inquiry into the Chaffinch boom.”
* * *
Detectives are also making inquiries about the
Young Bullfinch. A man on the Young Bull comes to
the manager of the Bullfinch, who had befriended him, and
says he : “ You did me a good turn once, and I’ll do you
one now. We’ve struck it rich in the Young Bull—here’s
the drillings.” Now, 999 men out of 1000 would take that
talk as being made in genuine gratitude for past favorc,
and the sampling of the drillings went 4oz. The manager
bought and told his friends. The manager of the Young
Bull was ill in the hospital, and when given the news he
sent out a man to sample, and the sampling blew the rich
strike into the Indian Ocean. The messenger was ap-
parently only a blunt tool, and the detective office hopes
to have the principals in a nice new dock soon.
* * * *
Some of the syndicates floated for prospecting
Yilgarn may be glad to know that many of the “ pros-
pectors’’are panning good prospects of beer in bars at
Southern Cross and elsewhere. Two representatives of
capital who were drifting very far to leeward had a pub-
lic talk on the position the other day, and the least lee-
wardly of the two said to the other: “ Why didn’t you
get off the shypoo for a day and peg out a few leases in
your spare time?” And the man who had pegged out
more liquor than the questioner replied : “ I ain’t had no
spare time. I have been drunk for tvvo weeks.” Some
of the money thus disappearing is good wowser money
from Adelaide, and loud shrieks may be expected as soon
as the Tabernacle syndicates know that their good cash
has been blown away in froth.
* * * *
“Where’s the (say) Golden Mountain Bullfrog?”
a mining man asked another mining man in the Bullfinch
country the other da3 r . “ Dunno,” said the mining man.
“ But i thought you represented Bilking on the field, and
that’s one of Bilking’s floats isn’t it?” “Yes,” said
Bilking’s manager ; “ but I can’t find the darned thing.
I’ve been out there twice, and I can’t strike the pegs—if
there are any pegs. And I’ve had instructions to do a
bit of work on it too.” All the same, at least a couple of
“manager’s reports” have been published in eastern
papers about the “ Operations in progress at the mine.”
Of course, Bilking’s manager may be a liar. On the other
hand, Bilking may be a thief. There have been more
than one of both sorts engaged in this Bullfinch business.

Fraser’s, Southern Cross (W. A.), which has pro-
duced a million pounds’ worth of gold, hasn’t had a
chance in recent times. Not a foot has been sunk for 12
years, and mostly tributors have done the work that has
been done. There is talk of a new float, and if it comes
off Fraser’s will have another chance. It is almost bound
to answer to developments once it has been relieved of
the inertia which is inexplainable except by the curse of
Deeming.

Trouble is threatening again in connection with
the firewood supply for the Kalgoorlie mines. The men
want more pay. They say they now earn 9s. per day—
frequently of more than eight hours —and they want to
be able to earn 10s. in eight hours. Laborers not on contract
also want a rise. Living is dear in the wood camps, the
work is hard, and the conditions scarcely civilised ; so, if
it goes to arbitration, the men will probably score. If
the wood cos. passed the extra cost on to the mining cos.,
two or three of the latter would probably seriously con-
sider shutting down. They would be very glad of some-
thing to divert the attention of shareholders ; and in that
case, of course, the shareholders would be strenuously
encouraged to curse the wood-cutters and workers in
general instead of the directors and managers, whom they
will be likely to curse if the diversion isn’t provided.

The two years’ agreement between the men and
most of the cos. at Broken Hill ran out on December 31 ;
but another has been arranged. There was never much
danger of a strike or lockout this time. The cos. were
ready to give a solid increase; the only thing they in-
sisted on was that the matter should be fixed for a fairly
long term. Four years was suggested. The Broken Hill
business people didn’t want the agreement to run
out at the end of a year—the uncertainty
spoils their Christmas trade. The cos. were ready
to oblige them to that extent; so a 4J years agree-
ment was asked for The smaller unions accepted
the rise—about 10 per cent. —offered ; and, on a vote, the
miners have followed suit. This doesn’t, however, apply
to the Broken Hill Prop. That co. professed two years
ago that it couldn’t pay the rates fixed by Justice
Higgins, of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and
refused to resume work in the mine ; and none has been
done there since. Work at the mill (where the co. treats
accumulated tailings for zinc) and at Port Pirie (where
custom smelting, etc., is done) has proceeded under
Justice Higgins’s award ; and this will continue until the

the first duties is naturally for engineers to direct their
special attention to these bearings and to car boxes for

The Bigelow Patent Rock Breaker commends;
itself to mine managers who welcome an effective
machine which is cheaper to maintain and repair than
Gyratory and other crushers. This machine is of the-
well-known Blake type, but has some additional improve-
ments which have justified in practice all the claims-
advanced by the patentee. The work of crushing is done-
on the down-stroke of the pitman instead of the up-
stroke ; there is no strain on the pitman cap ; two large-
side rods resist the thrust of the toggles, and enable the-
jaws to be regulated within a large range; the back
toggle is so made as to resist all legitimate strains of'
crushing, but will shear under exceptional conditions-
and save the machine. The shaft and eccentric bearings-
are self-lubricating ; the jaws are convex and concave,,
and with the cheek plates are made of steel and are-
reversible. The Austral Otis Engineering Company, of
South Melbourne, have installed a great number of these-
machines, and hold the sole manufacturing rights for the
Commonwealth.* [3

After being threatened for 12 or 15 years, the
Broken Hill Water Supply Co.’s monopoly has got its
knock-out at last. The McGowen Government passed
the Uniberumberka Bill; and the works, which were
actually started in O’Sullivan’s day, will be pushed on.
A couple of \ r ears at the outside oug-ht to see them
finished. How long- the dam will be before it has the job
of holding* back a flood nobody knows ; for Barrier creeks
don’t run as often as suburban trains. The co. has about
eight years more to go ; then it will have to hand over its
works to the Government, too. The Umberumberka
scheme will run to about £200,000 ; and though when it
is finished Broken Hill and the mines ought to be pretty
safe from water famine, interest, sinking fund and pump-
ing costs will be so heavy that there won t be any
cheap water—unless thev can work the Kalgoorlie swin-
dle over again, and make the general taxpayer hump some
of the burden.

“Jack” Scantlebury has been talking and
writing forover 20 years about the re-opening of Hawkins
Hill (N.S.W.), the famous mountain of gold and dirt
which yielded the most amazingly rich crushings ever
made in Australia. One 400-ton lot from Beyer and Hol-
termann’s gave 15,0000 z. —which makes even the Bull-
finch look mean. The hill was a nest of small 33ft.
claims; and, though small areas were all right while it
was a matter simply of chiselling out gold, it killed ex-
ploration at depth. Scantlebury has, for a quarter of a
century or so, had the idea of amalgamating the leases,
and getting to work that way ; but the job was a big one,
which called for much time and patience. However, it
has been done at last; and the next thing will be, no
doubt, an application to the public to come in and take
a risk in the business. The deepest workings are at
700 ft. ; but there is a good deal of quite shallow ground
which hasn’t yet been probed.
Very few of the old workings can now be
entered, and the accounts given to explain why work was
stopped run in ail sorts of ways—excessive costs, more
heavily mineralised stone, and so on. It isn’t always
good to believe the Ancient Inhabitant’s yarn about old
mining fields, and the tale that “she’s as good as ever she
was” is mostly a base reflection on the miner of the last
generation or the generation before last. As a rule, it
wasn’t his way to leave gold in a mine when he could
make a bit more than tucker by taking it out.
Still, two or three special things have to be noted
in this case: (1) The smallness of the claims.
If you only have half an acre of ground, it would need to
be amazingly rich stuff to pay to belt a shaft down to get
it. (2) If you’ve been in the habit of picking up sove-
reigns, a change to thrippenny-bits seems too dreadful to
make life worth living. On the other hand, if you’ve
only been in the habit of picking up pennies, a change to
thrippennies seems good enough to call for three cheers
and a spell for drinks. (3) We know a good deal more
about getting gold from mineralised stone than grand-
father did. (4) Rock-drills and better hauling appliances,
etc., have greatly cheapened work, especially in deep
mines. So Hawkins Hill will have another chance, and
deserves it. The richest stuff was in leaders, forming a
stockvyork, and it’s worth spending a good many thou-
sands to find out where those leaders came from.

The Cobar district promises some pretty good
developments in a small way after the holidays. The
New Eldorado gold mine will send a parcel of a few tons
away, and probably Mount Drysdale, which is driving at
the 560 ft. level, will have something cheerful to say
about prospects. The Canbelego copper mine will make
shipments to Cobar smelting works. Reserves in this
mine were some time since reckoned as worth between
£30,000 and £40,000; but that, of course, represents
gross value. At Mount Boppy a good development is
reported at the north end of the 600 ft. level. The Cobar-
Gladstone is showing a few inches of steel-grey ore of
high grade from the top to the bottom of the drive at
the south end of the 260 ft. level; five tons of ore sent
away assayed 32-39 per cent, copper, and 13 tons of
seconds assayed 7 - 15 per cent, copper. The C.S. A. mine
also reports a good development, and sooner or later this
mine is likely to pass to the Great Cobar.

John Fox, one of the best-known mining men
in N.S.W., died a day or two back. He crossed the
Murray from Bendigo, and fo, years managed the Cobar
Gold Mines. Then he got a big interest in the Queen
Bee, and struggled with that show for a long time, first
as chairman of directors and afterwards as manager.

Bookham, near Yass (N.S.W.), has had a rich
patch in the 75ft. south drive, and a 4-ton parcel has
assayed Boz. lldwt. per ton. Four-ton parcels, even of
Boz. ore, don’t make a mine, though ; and there are only
vague reports as to the size and value of the bulk of the
stuff. Thus it is said that there is 4ft. of “ milling ore"
in the face of the south drive, which probably means that
it is worth a few dwt. per ton. Driving was to have been
started at the 100 ft. level, but the enrichment near the
75ft. level proved too tempting. The Bookham is ob-
viously a patchy show and is likely to prove a gamble.

Tolwong (N.S.W.) publishes the results of x.
sample assay—ll'6 per cent, copper, 7’4 per cent, tin,
18 per cent, iron, and 2 per cent. zinc. Add the sulphur
(19 per cent.) and the arsenic (16 per cent.), and there is
a total of 74 per cent, of mineral. This was a special
test sample from two tunnels in No. 6 section. Some
time ago a mine report stated that this part of the lode
was 12ft. wide. But for the present the size of the re-
serves is less important than the treatment of this weird
mixture of metals as a commercial proposition. The
scannite show recently worked in Tasmania has practi-
cally closed down, as shipments of copper matte —which
seems to have been the chief product—did not give a pay-
able return ; and that doesn’t look hopeful, though the
Tolwong people themselves are professedly as confident
as ever.
* * * *
Vegetable Creek, the most hopeful deep-lead
tin show in N. S. Wales, has been handicapped by an im-
possible agreement with the freeholder, who was to be
paid off at greater speed than the mine could legitimately
stand. The Adelaide co. was in 130,000 shares, a big swag
of which were prefs., so that calls brought in compara-
tively little. Reconstruction or abandonment at length
became inevitable. To help a reconstruction the freeholder
is willing to make better terms, and the shareholders are
therefore to be invited to put up another shilling a share.
Nominally a new co. will be formed ; and in this concern
all shares will rank alike. On payment of the shilling
they will be issued as paid up to something under a
pound—a few shillings liability will be left to meet con-
tingencies. With things fixed up properly, development
on right lines will he possible. Hitherto the co. has been
mainly interested in chasing patches of rich wash. No-
doubt a new shaft will have to be considered ; the one
now in use is poorly situated for effective exploration.
* * * *
Ballarat, for all practical purposes, has ceased
to be a mining field. The Plateau knoweth no producer,
and Ballarat East clings on mostly to the skirts of the
tributor. He, poor devil, has not much chance of doing
more than earn a crust, though his lot is a little better
since the Mines Department came to his rescue and in-
sisted upon a decent agreement. What is wanted at
Ballarat is a big broom and a vigorous arm to sweep out
the present crop of directors and machinery men, to give
mines their own mills, and to put in charge modern
managers who would see if it was not possible to work the
big Ballarat East formations on a decent scale, and, with
proper appliances, make them pay the divs. that they
ought to yield. Ballarat doesn’t hustle out an annual
mining balance-sheet; when it does issue any figures it
mostly runs in some that relate to mines miles away. All
that is known is that, like Bendigo, it will show a poorer
return than it did for 1909, even with the outside-district
figures thrown in.
*■* * *
Bendigo plumes don’t flutter in the breeze with
the old flaunt. For 1910 the record of dividends is one
of the worst the field has ever shown. Not only was the
gold yield low, but calls were high and dividends were
disappointing. How disappointing can be judged from
the following table :
Gold, Calls. Dividends,
oz. £ £
1905.. 218.683 175,281 230,009
1906.. 223,733 231,262 246,254
1907.. 196,944 208,779 122,017
1908.. 193,253 135,923 126,268
1909.. 213,681 110,762 159,685
1910.. 185,394 119,057 96,289
Here is a drop of £63,000 for the year, while if 1906 be
taken as a basis for comparison, the decline is £150,000.
No wonder that there is comparative stagnation in the
old field. It is not hard to give a reason. The field was
for years a slave to the idea that the only thing was to
chase the gold down to over 4000 ft., to the absolute
neglect of. the side lines where shallow saddles could be
picked up. The experience of Bendigo itself has been
that below 3000 ft. the shoots of gold shorten, and they
become poorer. It is the same the world over, and no
reason exists why nature should cut Bendigo out for
something exceptional. The find at the Central Blue
came just in time to save the field. This co. built up the
divvy list £16,000 in a short six months, topping old
stagers like Catherine Beef and Virginia, which were the
only other cos. to run into five figures for the year. A good
sign is that tributors netted good profits. Even reckon-
ing them in, Bendigo had in 1910 its worst time for a
couple of decades at least. But its record to date—
-19,189,9180z., valued at £76,760,000 —takes a lot of beating.
* * « *
Minister Mcßride would serve the cause of the
Vic. State coal-mine better if he would slop hifalutin and
come down to bedrock. When he is challenged with
having made a loss at the mine during the first few
months, why does he not say: “Yes, that’s true,” and
ask those who are baiting him to show a mine at which
they did any better in the first six months ? Then he also
needs to get the business management seen to. The
civil servant isn’t always a careful soul in handling other
people’s money, and there has been a good deal of waste
here. If he will have proper working costs kept he will
take a big step towards success.
* * * *
White Star, Gippsland (Vic.), might as well be
rechristened White Elephant. Most of the shareholders
have got tired of dropping gold into the mine, and it is
said that less than one-third of the 60,000 shares are now
alive. A good deal of development has been done ; but
last year’s little lot of stone gave under 3dwt., and as
that isn’t enough to make a meal of, the directors fill up
the weary shareholders’ plate with hope—which isn’t
fattening, especially when it is of the worn and wilted
variety.
* * * *
For November, Great Fitzroy’s production of
metals (185'6 tons copper, 9920 z. gold, and 39240 z. silver)
was officially given as £15,696. But the revenue expected
by Great Fitzroy was only £11,806 ; so £3890, or £2l per
ton of copper, comes off the gross value to cover freight,
reduction of matte, and refining and realisation. Under
the circumstances, no wonder profits have been small
and only obtainable by picking the best stopes. The
management now sends along the comforting assurance
that it will save fully £6 per ton of copper by doing its
own converting, which it is just about ready to do.
* * * *
Gympie (Q.) made a fair effort for Christmas
with 6611 tons for 60330 z. gold, and £12,129 as divi-
dends—figures exclusive of those of the Bull-owned
Scottish Gympie, which pays £4125 quarterly. The
Scottish, by the way, has put itself into a rattling good
position, and has been paying for a great deal of develop-
ment out of profits. The harvest should be reaped pre-
sently. Gympie Homeward Bound has been resurrected
as Two-Mile Consols ; apparently a co. has been floated
in Melbourne. Apparently, also, some of the same people
are concerned in the matter as were in the Home Buie
and Hilton float, which got so much unpleasant notice a
few months back.
* * * *
Gympie surprised itself by paying four Christmas
divs. Even S. Glanmire and Monkland was in the list.

Pretty well everybody at Charters Towers has a
flutter in the share market; and the bigger the promise
in the mines the more energetic the flutter on the pave-
ment. Measuring things by that rule, the Towers situ-
ation can’t be considered cheerful. Here is the total of
the shares sold in the past four years:—l9o7, 461,991 ;
1908, 1,823,644 ; 1909, 862,055 ; 1910, 466,168. And the
close of the past year was the dullest part of it on
'Change.
* * * *
Charters Towers market closed the year in a
dull mood. The failure of the Brilliant St. George to
locate the Day Dawn at 1860 ft., following the poor results
obtained in Clark’s shaft, has cast a doubt on far eastern
Day Dawn prospects. Nevertheless, things may still
turn out all right; and the Towers remembers hopefully
the hard times the field passed through before the Day-
Dawn was struck in the New Brilliant Freehold and the
East Mexican. Then, just as Mills’ United began to feel
the strain of a continuous output of rich stone, the Free-
hold came along and gave £60,000 in dividends. The
Freehold is now likely to reduce its monthly crushings,
and it remains to be seen whether the East Mexican will
take up the running and provide a few dividends. The
shaft will soon be finished, and the winding engine in-
stalled at the 760 ft. level. All that is known for certain
is that there is a rich shoot of stone skirting the New
Freehold boundary, but how many levels it will rise to
in the Mexican lease can only be determined by develop-
ment. The extension of No. 5 is the most important
work in hand.
* * # *
Brilliant Deeps, Charters Towers, crushed 270
tons for £BB5. The previous month’s return was 255
tons for an average of £3 13s. 6d. per ton. The most im-
portant development work in hand is the sinking of a
winze below No. 3 N.E. level. This winze is between 70
and 80ft. deep, and has occasionally shown a strong reef.
The co. holds 100 acres adjacent to some important
mines. The Brilliant Extended western levels are a
source of hope; but they have not yet gone far
enough on payable stone to reach the Deeps boundary.
Generally speaking, the reef worked in the Deeps lease
has been more erratic than the main Brilliant formation.
* * * *
Blucher’s Victory, near Charters Towers, felt a
trifle sadder just before the holidays, because No. 4 had
failed topiekup the reef. A promising formation will
be driven on, and it is still possible that stone will be
met with as good as that found in No. 3. The financial
position is pretty strong, so the directors risked a little
thrippenny div.
* * * *
Golden Horn (Mount Leyshon) is 18 miles from
Charters Towers. In the old days the big quartzite and
porphyry formation, interlaced with numerous ironstone
leaders, kept a big mill at work. It is now hoped that,
with up-to-date methods, including a suction-gas plant
and cyanide vats, the big low-grade body can be made to
pay. It is figured that material from the open cut can
be handled for Bs. per ton. Looking at the fact that
Mount Bischoff can deal with its soft porphyry' and allu-
vial dirt for very little over 45., there is hope for low-
grade propositions that can command cheap power and
water. If the Golden Horn is a winner, other low-grade
propositions in the neighborhood of Charters Towers are
safe for a trial.
* * * *
Kulamadau, Woodlark Island, will have a
credit of £4OOO after paying its sixpenny (£3125). Most
of it will be wanted ; for a good outlay is in view. The
mine is to be equipped with a third Huntingdon mill,
and shaft-sinking is to be attended to. The stopes carry
wide faces of payable ore, but values are erratic, and the
market is inclined to be a bit nervous.
* * * *
Mount Molloy (N. Queensland), in which John
Moffat is heavily interested, hopes that a connecting line
with Port Douglas will help to revive its fortunes, partly
by giving- its tramway something to do. The distance is
only 22 miles, but there is the coast range, which would
make the job expensive. Mount Molloy paid several
dividends, but, as so often happens with copper shows,
development at depth was unsatisfactory and divs.
stopped with a jerk. The timber concessions also have
not turned out so profitable as was expected. Looking
at the expense of entering on a short smelting cam-
paign, the directors lately decided to sell all the ore
stacked up to the Ohillagoe Co. The heap brought from
the Anniversary mine at Herberton, purchased by Mount
Molloy, has, therefore, been sent to Ohillagoe with the
rest.
* * * *
Mungana (N. Queensland) has determined to
sink deeper, so it is improving its pumping equipment.
Both shafts are to go down, one to explore the Lady Jane
lode below 320 ft. and the other the Girofla down to
710 ft. Shipments of ore are being made to Ohillagoe,
which, from their high silver and copper contents, appear
to be of payable grade. All through its career, however,
Mungana has never been able to do much more than feed
the smelting co. And it hasn’t even had the satisfaction
of seeing the smelting co. get fat.
* * * *
Mfc. Lyell has consigned 1614 tons blister copper
since the last half-year closed on Sept. 30. For 12 weeks
the output was 1790 tons copper, 152,8680 z. silver, and
22930 z. gold from 83,749 tons of ore. That is close on
1000 tons per day, and if the weather had been finer
the average would have been higher. The strength of
Mt. Lyell lies in the fact that, by extracting metal from
over 90 per cent, of the material fed to the furnace, it can
show exceptionally low costs ; and its smelting charge is
also almost perfect chemically, so that it can make blister
in two operations. If only Mt. Morgan could do the
same, there would be some firework dividends. But,
though Morgan’s practice will improve, it never will be
able to do what Lyell is doing with apparent ease.
* * * *
With its tin selling at over £174 per ton, Mount
Bischoff (Tas.) was able to double its distribution for De-
cember, and shells out 10s. per share (£6000). The pro-
duction of black tin concentrates is being maintained at
90 tons per month. On this output a rise of £ll per ton
in the value of concentrates gives the co. an extra 10s.
per share profit every six months. The average value of
the dirt treated is under J per cent, tin oxide ; in other
words, it takes over 200 tons of dirt to produce a ton of
concentrates. The Queen lode is, however, a fissure, and
of better quality than the big benches of decomposed
porphyry worked near the surface. The striking feature
about Mount Bischoff is the economical manner in which
the poor material is handled ; costs have sometimes been
as low as 4s. per ton.

W. Smith : The balance-sheet will be discussed
here in about three weeks. As to recovering, better con-
sult a solicitor. The bank has in general dealt very
reasonably with its old clients O.K. :No;it is a very
big risk.... Lionel M. : There wasn’t any big fire in B.H.
Block 10. The big one in Block 12 started in 1897 ; that’s
the one that led to the sealing of the section which has
only just been re-opened M.K.: Didn’t know it; it is
apparently a process for smelting- in what are really con-
verters. That is not new—Knudson does it with basic
copper ores in Norway. But it is just about ascertain as
anything can be that not many ores could be dealt with
in that way W.T.K. : Well, it’s not the sort of thing
we should put the widow’s mite into.

Seeing how much the little mining speculator
depends on the dailies for his information, it is as well
Australian markets should know that Adelaide gets
its press information of the Bullfinch from one source.
The stuff is sent to the Kalgoorlie Miner, which sends it
to the West Australian, which sends to both the old
Adelaide papers, and these send the worn and frayed
news to Sydney and Melbourne. And it’s all for cheap-
ness, and almost anything does so long as nobody who
can kick is libelled.

More figures arrive concerning the Tanganyika
concessions, in mid-Africa, the huge proposition tow'hich
Queenslander Alan Gibb was taken as metallurgist. The
mines were, at latest advices, just starting production,
after a capital expenditure of over £1,500,000. They
reckon to work up to a production of 60,000 tons of metal
within three years—which isn’t any' too good news for
other copper-producers, for the world is pretty well sup-
plied already.

“L. Lear”: The Bulletin propels a needed
brick against the Queensland State Bank. The institu-
tion is nominally there to help the farmer ; but the red
rope to cut, before the required aid can be got, bars hun-
dreds of good State customers. The clause re “ unspeci-
fied purposes” is like a 6ft. high jump to the “flat”
athlete. Take a case in point. Two young Australians
with small capital in three y'ears put improvements on
their block to the value of £6OO. Besides, they had
ploughs, other implements, horses and a small herd of
cattle. Crops failed through the dispensation of the con-
troller of water w'orks, and the men on the land were
unable to pay their rents (£9O) and rates (£2O). They
could not borrow from the State Bank because it will not
advance unless rents are fully paid up. Also, they would
have to state that the money was wanted for lib. tea,
three gallons flour, a pint of pins, and a kerosene tin, and
they weren’t sure that they would want the pins.
By the terms on which ‘ the land was selected
they could not mortgage to Private Enterprise
until five years’ residence had been fulfilled. Not-
withstanding the ample security, 20 acres of grow-
ing crop and their own personal integrity, they
were notified that their land was forfeited. The only
trouble was that they had run into a dead-end for ready
cash. Another cocky was advanced money to buy cows.
But he also purchased a horse to cart away his cream,
and for that his draft was dishonored. He couldn’t buy a
horse with cow money. When the Kidston has relieved
himself of the tons of State Frights that are sitting on his
chest, he might do worse than rake away the red-tape
entanglements, put a No. 12 boot to the door of the State
Bank, and allow some capital to flow out through the
cavity.
* * * *
“P.X.”: The idea begins to circulate that
almost any old thing can get a quotation on the Ade-
laide Stock Exchange; so that nowadays, when a pro-
position is turned down by the committee of (say) the
Sydney Exchange, the desperate promoter, anxious to
make a market for his shares, thinks at once of Adelaide
It is largely the fault of the Adelaide system. The Sydney
Exchange, for instance, has a committee which goes
through the articles and rules, etc., of a co. when it
applies to be put upon the list; and the fees paid by the
co. when it is listed go to the Exchange. In Adelaide the
similar committee, it seems, gathers in the fees for itself.
If a co. is unsound, or if it has a rule which gives (sav)
the vendors or other parties an unfair advantage over the
rest of the public, it is supposed to be passed out. The
Sydney committee is no worse off for passing a co. out;
while every refusal to put a co. on the Adelaide list
means something out of the committeemen’s pocket.
That may make not one atom of difference to the decision
of the committee ; but if Judges and jurors only got
their salaries and their fees when the prisoner was found
not guilty, some possibly uncharitable people would be
almost bound sooner or later to disparage the adminis-
tration of justice in that neighborhood.

Most of the advts. calling on objectors to Bull-
finch mining-leases to speak up promptly at the Warden’s
office, or for ever hold their pence, are signed with as
short a name as there is in the Directory—Du. Not du
anything; just J. T. Du.

Bullfinch railway should be completed by mid-
February, and the W.A. Government will then probably
decide to go on with a line from Southern Cross south
through Marvel Loch. Yilgarn is a great prospecting
field, but the big low-grade shows south of* the Cross
cannot do much without a line.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, January 2, 1911.
My Dkar Arint, —
The stars in their courses fought for the Sydney
theatres and concerts on New Year’s Eve. The
Chinese method of celebrating a festival—with
noises—being forbidden, and the shops being shut,
there was little for the people to do but go to
places of entertainment. The press says more
prople than usual got vine leaves in their hair.
Possibly. They had next day, Sunday, with the
New Year imposed upon it, in which to comb
them out and make good resolutions. On the
Saturday evening every house of mirth was full.
“The Whip” was sold out at 7.30, and “The
Girl from Rector’s ” about the same half-hour.
Grace Palotta’s clothes in this rectory frisk are too
sweet for words written in black ink. They should
be in rose pink extract of sweet-pea. A pink
cloth with big black buttons and collar is one
creation. There’s a toque of green silk that hugs
Grace’s head quite closely, and nobody quite likes
Grace in small toques. There’s a gown in
smoked ninon and murky green and dull pink;
and there’s a grey chiffon evening frock, and an
assortment of evening coats from chiffon to white
lace.
The Lucas-Tooth baronet has arrived on one of
his rare, brief visits to this great land whose
passion for beer has made him what he is. He
has a place at Kameruka, which he likes to see
occasionally ; also, he insists on peering into the
family beer-vat from time to time to assure him-
self that it is keeping up its old reputation.
There are a few Teeth still in N.S.W., but they
lack the affluence of Lucas. Many stories are
told in London about the family’s great wealth.
It is said that the first word the youthful Tooth
is taught is “money”; the second “beer.”
Sometimes a thoughtless nurse reverses the order.
The mistake is viewed at headquarters with a
tolerant eye; but let any other word in all the
bright lexicon of Webster be impressed on the
budding Tooth intellect, and the erring servitor
is either fried or frozen—l forget which.
Baronet Edmund Hayes and his wife departed
for Hibernian parts last week after giving the fine
flower of Sydney the best thing in good-byes at
the Rose Bay Golf Club. Although the Irish
baronet has possessed his title for 10 years, he has
not used it—at least, not on week days. His
wife was a Sydnev-sider, Miss Alice Wilkinson, a
daughter of an old Judge who died here recently.
The Hayes have a place at Como. Our Como,
you know; not the one in Switzerland. They
have, as well, a castle in Ireland—the real thing,
with a banshee and shamrocks, and tunder and
turf.
Mr. and Mrs. Cyril Ward and Captain Gilliat
left Australia last week. They are going to tour
Japan and then head for England, where Mr.
Ward has a constituency to nurse and Captain
Gilliat a regiment to rejoin.
The social columns of the Indian papers notify
Mrs. T. H. Kelly’s arrival at Lucknow. She was
a guest while there of the Hore-Ruth vens (he, you
will remember, was, till recently, Military Secre-
tary to the G.-G. here); and, in their charge, she
witnessed the Army Cup races and the polo
matches which rage in the siege-city at this time
of year.
Foreign wool-buyers are a notoriously cheerful
class. It is difficult to quench their light-hearted-
ness ; but last week, through the death of Mrs.
Leon Dewynne, who had been for some years a
genial and sympathetic hostess to the little foreign
wool-buying colony in Sydney, the latter were put
into genuine mourning, in spirit if not habiliment.
Mrs. Dewynne was a pretty young woman with
red-gold hair, a Sydneysider who usually frocked
in French fashion-plate form. She and her blond
husband were noticeable figures at race meetings
and first nights, and their devotion to each other
was remarkable in an age of marital drift-in-oppo-
site-directions. Before her marriage she was Miss
Maud Moseley. Mrs. Dewynne entered a private
hospital to undergo a minor operation, and died
24 hours after its performance.
Mrs. Claude McKay and her small boy go away
to see her people by next trip of the Somerset.
In view of her seafaring, her husband’s present to
her on the recent anniversary of her orange-
blossoming was appropriate. It was oddearrings—
a red jewel and a green jewel, signifying the star-
board and port'lights. As odd earrings happen to
be “coming in,” this will be counted unto
the lady for knowledgableness. Mrs. McKay’s
mother, it may be mentioned, is playing in the
provincial tour in “ Priscilla Runs Away,” and
her father (Mr. Thomas Sidney) is with Miss Ger-
trude Kingston at a metropolitan theatre.
More of our well-known people are flying north
about Eastertide. Mr. Owen Cox, managing-
director of the Federal-Houlder-Shire lines, his
daughter (Miss Doris Cox) and his niece (Miss
Gwladys Bensor) depart by the Mongolia in
April.
George Hoskins, eldest son of the ironworks
man who is going to start making rails for Aus-
tralian trains to run over, went to foreign parts a
few months back to see to the shipping of another
hundred thousand pounds worth or so of ma-
chinery. Having a few minutes to spare, and it
being an axiom in the Hoskins’s establishment
that minutes weren’t made to waste, the tremend-
ously-serious young Australian rushed to one of
Britain’s moated granges and got married. Bride
and bridegroom returned in time to buy a few
things for Christmas.
Sydney and the visitors thereto don’t know how
much they’ve missed in not seeing the romantic
comic opera, “A Moorish Maid,” at the Standard
Theatre. It ought to be at Her Majesty’s, and
the plain-thinking and high-kicking of the Gibbs
musical farce should be at the Standard. Music
and libretto of “A Moorish Maid” are by Austral-
asians ; and the first is excellent enough for any
capital city in the world, and the second is fairly
cleverand witty. Mrs. Slapoffski (LaZara) has been
in great form ; and Appleby and Cannam (Can-
nam is the Lauri of fun) and others have been
worthy of all Sydney’s applause.
London hostesses have been driven to the
drastic measures in operation at Australian
Government Houses as a means of checking the
incursion of uninvited unknowns to their parties.
At a big crush, the hostess rarely knows more
than a quarter of her guests by sight. Some she
has sent cards because she or her husband
owes them money; others are bidden in
the hope that they may ultimately become
creditors. Stockbrokers and their families
are asked, with an eye to useful tips.
All these, and hundreds of others who troop into
the ball-room, are accorded a smile of bogus
welcome and passed on to an excellent supper
and much sound champagne. For years past it
has been the custom of hungry and impecunious
young men to patronise any big ball that was
going. That is to say they patronised the food
and drink. Later, growing bolder, they started
taking their young women along for company.
The limit is said to have been reached when half
a dozen young roysterers came on from a Covent
Garden ball, with the ladies they had met
there, to Lady Somebody’s hop, and danced a
vinous measure, to the horror of the guests.
The fact that one of the Covent Garden ladies was
the discharged kennel maid of a friend of the
hostess brought about the downfall of the party.
The male members were in no mood to go quietly,
and a melee occurred that roused the neighbor-
hood. Now each guest at a big London party has
to supply clear proof of identity. It is likely that
a butler who is quick at reading finger-prints will
yet command a high figure in the halls of the
English nobility.
Which reminds me that London Star made a
smashing retort last month to the Daily Tele-
graph’s strictures on Mr. Redmond’s conduct in
returning to England, from America, with £40,000
of Home Rule gold in his pocket. It simply repub-
lished from a back number of the Telegraph a list
of Unionist peers—five dukes, two marquises and
seven earls—who among them had taken forty
million pounds sterling from the U.S. in the form
of Yankee heiresses’ bank accounts. Failing their
wives’ dots, a number of these noblemen would
have been too absorbed dodging judgment debtors,
ca. sa. orders, bankruptcy notices and so forth
to have a minute to spare for fighting against
Home Rule.
Thanks to the lady who writes under the inky
mask of Frank Dan by, we have a new name for
the golden-haired woman—chemical gold or
natural. In her latest book, “ Let the Roof Fall
In,” she has a woman whose strong point is her
pale-fawn hair. It was waved daily by the best
hairdresser in London and washed with white of
egg and champagne. She was Lady CarrieCarthew,
a widow of 35, a modern Becky Sharp, wickeder
perhaps, and more vulgar, and she was known as
the Yellow Peril. She used and misused men in
her yellow-perilous, fluffily-foolish fashion, and
she was as clever as a Yankee financier. No
matter how large was the hat fashion, she never
wore one large enough to cover her star attraction
—the pale-fawn hair. Wise Lady Carrie !
The March, April and June babies of “Eliza-
beth and Her German Garden ” are now father-
less. News from London tells of the death of the
Baron von Arnim of heart failure in Germany.
His interest to Australians lies in the fact that
his wife was a Sydney girl, a Miss Beecham,
daughter of a tea-merchant of years ago.
I’ve heard she spelt her name as Beauchamp is
pronounced. And she is a niece of Lassetter,
senior. In the “Garden” the late Baron
figured as “ the Man of Wrath.” A very lovable
monster he was, evidently. The Sydneysider
named her three daughters by the months of their
birth, and her references to the June, April or
March baby are full of a gentle humor. Whether
she would have loaded an infant with “ De-
cember ” or “ January,” had it arrived on either
of those months, would be another story. Baroness
von Arnim recently dramatised her novel, “Prin-
cess Priscilla,” and it was produced in London as
“ Priscilla Runs Away.”
Our one-time friend and visitor, Kubelik, has
been in Mr. Justice Channell’s court over a fid-
dling engagement that didn’t eventuate in time.
He sued a concert agent for £256 in respect of
certain concerts in 1908. The agent counter-
claimed, because Kubelik was not back in time
from America to take part in the first series of
the concerts. Kubelik recovered £l5O.
Mention of Mr. Justice Ohannell reminds me of
a story told at his expense by Dr. J. W. Smith,
K.C., of Perth (W.A.). Smith was one of the
counsel in an Admiralty Court case. So was
Channell. Now, Ohannell misused his h’s fear-
somelv. The cause of the litigation was a collision
in the” English Channel between a barque named
the Hannah and some other craft. Naturally,
Channell, the h-less called her the “’Anna.” At
last the presiding Judge asked: the
barque really named, Hannah or Anna?” Re-
plied Smith’s leader : “When she left Gravesend
she was the Hannah ; but she dropped an h in the
chops of the Channel.”
Mrs. Harbord’s name appears quite regularly
these days “ amongst those flying.” She was Mrs.
Arthur Blackwood, of Melbourne, until she
married a brother of Lady Carrington. It is a
pretty good record for one born in the autumn of
the nineteenth century; for flying over church
steeples and Eiffel Towers must demand several
ounces more nerve and courage than walking or
driving on the earth.
The most nineteen-hundred-and-elevenish thing
in raiment is a motor-coat with a camel’s fleece
lining. Ladies luxurious, who have such, say it is
the softest and warmest thing in pelts. Most of
us will learn with surprise that the camel has a
fleece. Camels I have known had skins very like
mousey and much-worn oilcloth. In fact, old
followers of the Prophet, owners of camel
teams in W.A., were in the habit (in
the early Coolgardie days) of stitching
oilcloth or felt over the sores on their camels’
backs—stitching on to the original stuff, you
know —and the darn would almost defy detection.
This unique tailoring would be done only when
some dog of a Christian buyer was to be had.
Some genius of the Aboriginal page will be sure
to write saying the foregoing is not true —but I
don’t care.
I have just read somewhere that our recent
visitor, Dr. Bell, the telephone man, is trying to
teach monkeys to talk. It sounds to me about as
futile as teaching flunkeys to stalk; besides,
there are already too many that talk,
and they talk a vast deal too much. To a certain
class of mind, there seems something fascinating
in the idea of upsetting the old order of things ;
thus when it is discovered, after profound
research, that a dog can bark and a man can
drink beer, there is a rush to teach men to bark
and dogs to drink beer. Also, I believe, there
is a great desire to evolve the tree-climbing
horse and the sky-rabbit. If there was any
hope of evolving a polished, eloquent and
grammatical monkey who would write the
History of Monkeydom in ten volumes, and
tell us all about the inner workings of man-
dril society I would be interested, but apparently
it is only intended to teach our arboreal friend to
shout “ pretty cocky,” or something of the kind,
on general principles as the parrot does, and that
bird’s unsupported statements already make my
head ache terribly. And even if the polished and
grammatical ape did arrive he might be a failure.
For instance, he might become Premier, and ex-
pose us to the ridicule of nations by addressing the
House with a book of reference held in his pre-
hensile foot and a mass of documents wrapped up
in his tail.
A lady of Yassberra —where the Federal capi-
tal is going to thirst beside the chain of waterholes
in which the Daily Telegraph’s angler doesn’t
go fishing—has written in impassioned terms to
King O’Malley, urging the claims of the waratah
to be appointed national flower to the Common-
wealth. The lady, who seems to have no use for
the wattle, says that “the back of the waratah is
strong and straight, and it holds its handsome
head erect and looks the whole world in the face.”
Evidently she considers the waratah as a sort of
red-faced vegetable Village Blacksmith who owes
not any man. Considering the size of Australia’s
lOU, about which the Wild Cat complains so
often, I don’t see how the fluffy golden wattle,
with its delicate suggestion of pawnshops, can be
ignored altogether.
The uprush of the waters of charity has nearly
blown the lid off the top of the bore. A friend,
who won’t allow a name to be mentioned, has sent
£5O for the Child Study Association charity. It’s
on a fragrant couch of amaranth and moly that
this donor will lie in the Future Beautiful. That
is, if he doesn’t prefer feathers. The hon. sec. of
the charity, in mentioning the number of cases of
infantile paralysis cured during the year just
ended, would like it known tha,t Dr. Alan Carroll
has of late undertaken the treatment of the
affliction in the adult.
Lewisham Hospital patients are telling their
visitors of the dual festival they had on the 25th
of December. It is six years since the great
Birthday fell on a Sunday ; it will be 1921 before
the biggest festival again falls on the lesser holy-
day. Patients tell that the wards were brilliantly
decorated, that everyone got presents of real
value, that the number and variety of winged
things eaten at every meal must have decimated
the edible feathered kingdom, and that no other
institution could have any chance with Charlotte
Russe, as that adorable thing was wooed to ex-
tinction at the Lewisham. These things are writ
because the patients complain that the glory of
their Christmas celebrations were not adequately
appreciated by the press. They were all on so
royal a scale that they deserved the National
Anthem.
If those who managed the recent Palace Theatre
production in aid of the Lewisham Hospital take
several sizes larger in hats after looking at the
figures on the cheque they handed to the head of
the hospital, no one dare bite a thumb at them,
or at Mrs. Boult, who wrote, rehearsed and
staged “Charley,” if she sees her shadow as long
as Pitt-street. The matinee was little heralded—
it was given on an afternoon of Satanic mugginess,
and no crowned heads were present; yet the
painting on the cheque ran —galloped rather —
close up to three hundred lovely pounds sterling.
Miss Rosina Buckman has been experiencing a
gently chequered career of late. Her engage-
ments, the rescinding of the same, and her re-
engagements must have made her feel she didn’t
know where she were. However, any disap-
pointment over the “ Waltz Dream” job must be
mitigated by the salve of salary, all the same.
Her engagement for the part of the Balkan
Princess in the production of that name is, how-
ever, a very definite thing, and not to be upset or
altered save by special intervention of Provi-
dence.
Another hospital matron has taken a yoke-
mate. Miss McGowen, of the Molong hospital,
was married last week to an officer on one of the
inter-State boats. She carried the usual bridal
outfit, plus an uncommon Brussels lace veil.
Miss Winifred Gullett—a daughter of the well-
known and very financial pressman who has had
the unique distinction of editing both S. M.
Herald and Daily Telegraph— is to be married
early in January. She weds a man from Colombo
—Mr. Arthur Etherington.
Port Moresby has taken toll of the well-known
Joubert family. In November, Jules Ernest, a
son of the Lismore Jouberts, died at the Papuan
port, aged 23. His elder brother, himself a young-
ster, was one of the pioneers thereward.
Mr. J. C. Williamson, who gets back here
about March, tells in a private letter that the
gaiety of capitals, if not of nations, seems to have
swung round to Berlin. The glare of its gaiety
throws Paris into the dusk. He wonders when
the inhabitants sleep. A man may go to an
opera-house or a theatre at seven in the evening,
and at two in the morning he may go to another
good show and be in time for the uprush of the
curtain. If any but one so trustworthy as J.C. W.
were to tell that there were theatres that opened
two hours after midnight, he might not be be-
lieved.
Medlow Hydro is densely inhabited. It owns a
new dining-room carpet, the laying of which was
a ceremony like unto a religious rite. The choice
textile is in soft, glowing, crimson tones. The
lamp-shades, fashioned by a lady from Liberty's
(a dealer in charms and spells, worked off in silks
and gauzes and art papers), are an extra reason
for merely viewing the place. Viewers’ shillings
for last year amounted to £5OO.
A Melbourne friend sends me 10s. for division
between the Hospice and the Child Study Associ-
ation. Thanks, friend.
From the English paper, Votes for Women
A verv unfortunate and ill-judged appointment is that
of the Eight Hon. Lewis Hareourt to the office of Secre-
tary for the Colonies. Keen resentment will be felt by
the women of Australia and Maoriland—who enjoj
liberties of self-government equally with men—that tr
representatives should in future be obliged to deal 1
their relations with the Mother Country with an avowed
opponent of women’s political enfranchisement and a
subscriber to the secret funds of the Anti-Suffrage Lea .
The Government would have been better advised had
they chosen for this office a man less tarred with tne
Anti-Suffrage brush. For the women in Australia and
Maoriland have every right to protest against the affront
that has been offered to them.
The women of M.L. and Australia 95 per cent,
of them certainly—don’t know that Harcourt is
Secretary for the Colonies. The average woman
has a vague idea that she has heard of ‘ Culu
Harcourt, but probably thinks “she ” is a dancer
at the Hippodrome.
Pursuing the subject to its native lair : I see
that our friend, Lord Beauchamp, lately received
a deputation in favor of Woman Suffrage. He
told it that his sympathies were with it
His personal experience in Australia showed him that
it was for the general good of the country as a whole that
its women should be enfranchised ; that women would
never have proper attention paid to the question of their
wages until they received political rights, and that ne
found that the standard of political morality was raised
when women took part. Nevertheless, he declined to
pledge himself to any particular measure, but expressed
the hope that in the course of the next few months the
Movement would get sufficient public support to enable
it to pass a Bill into law.
Meantime the leaders of the Movement (note the
capital M in our ex-Gov.’s quoted remarks) are not
taking any chances—except of gaol—and continue
to smite the enemy on his shiny hat or his window-
panes.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.

Consult any competent judge of billiard tables, and he’ll
promptly tell you that there are no tables equal to “Alcock’s.”
Many of the leading billiard matches have been played on
these tables—the match between George Gray and Fred
Lindrum, jun., when Gray scored 836, 831 coming off the red,
thus establishing two world’s records, and for which Gray
received a gold medal, is an example. This score is another
proof of the marvellous accuracy and perfect construction of
our billiard tables.
Each table is fitted with Imperial Low Cushions, and

The Excellence of SARGENTS’ WEDDING CAKES
cannot be over-estimated. A proof of their perfection is clearly shown in the
increasing demand, not only in Sydney and Melbourne, but practically
all over the Commonwealth. Their superior quality is due to the select
recipe and the particular way in which they are prepared. Whatever design
of cake is decided upon, whether it be simple or elaborate, there is not the
least difference in the quality —each possesses the same deliciousness of taste.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, January 2, 1911.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The Chirnsides have bagged the Prince, and all
the other wealthy woolgrowers are in despair.
What is a motor visit from a G.-G. going to count
now in homestead chalk-marks after the Chirn-
sides’ royal record in bush hospitality? Prince
Leopold left Federal Government House on Sun-
day for Carrandallac, where Gordon Chirnside,
brother of Pursey, dumps his wool-bale.
The Dudleys have departed to Ercildoune,
Lady Sarah Wilson’s station, where Melba rested
for some months during her last Australian visit.
The Carmichaels are summering at Macedon, in
the lovely Jarrah cottage there. The visiting
Prince went from the G.-G.’s to the Macedon cot
for a day or two before he passed on to the Chirn-
sides’ wattle-and-bark hut. Sassiety in general
has gone to hill and sea, and when it hasn’t gone
it has to pretend that it has. Sweet girls of the
subbubs only motor into town for necessary shop-
ping ; it isn’t form to be seen in the city
except in motor-hats or the Dorothy-Angelica
type of sunbonnet—pink and blue and lilac—
or in yachting rig or seaside clothes. It is all
very instructive and entertaining. Children’s par-
ties are the only “ events.” If the frivols are not for
real children, they are for grown-up irresponsibles.
There was a fine crop of Christmas trees before
the general exodus. The Dudleys discovered
one growing in their ballroom ; and that necessi-
tated a most exclusive pony-party. The creamiest
of the youth of Melbourne motored along, and
were fed liberally with toys and bonbons. The
aides had to implore the help of military pals to
keep order and regulate the number of pink ice-
creams consumed.
The latest bait on the summer boarding-house
line is the announcement that a dark room is
available for photographers. In these days of day-
light developers, few amateurs bother about a
dark room ; but it has its advantages all the same.
Look-outs and cosy-corners in fern gullies are poor
retreats when compared with a dark room, if an
affectionate pair have some films to develop.
Marriages and approaching marriages are help-
ing to make the holiday season joyful. Ethel
Fisken, one of the smart Toorakety team, takes
over Dickie O’Hara for better or worse in
February. Richard, from Bananaland, is the son of
the late C. O’Hara, who lived in the northern
State, but really belonged to County Sligo.
Another Australian whose speech retains a sug-
gestion of Dublin is among the marrying folk.
Dr. “ Chuck ” Dane, who is formally recorded as
Dr. Paul Greig Dane, married the pretty little
brunette Ruth Parker early in December. Mrs.
Dane is the youngest of the pretty Parker girls of
Williamstown. The knot was tied at Holy
Trinity.
For the Bevan-Hurvitch wedding, at which the
pastor himself asked the fateful questions, the
Independent Church was turned into a garden.
The bride drew wealth behind her in the shape of
a train of exquisite Limerick. Mrs. Bevan, the
bride’s mother, has some of the most beautiful
old lace in Melbourne. Sister Doctor Sybil left
her Queensland practice for the occasion, and
came down to act as first bridesmaid. The
Springthorpe chicken Enid acted as second, and
a small niece helped in the mistv-blue ninon sym-
phony. Mrs. Bevan, who always wraps her
beautiful grey hair in priceless lace, wore a small
bonnet of the dainty material and a marvellous
silk Indian shawl.
Rupertswood, Baronet Clarke’s country man-
sion, is not to be opened as a mere batching estab-
lishment, the Russell Clarkes having arranged to
take up their abode there early in 1911. It is a
beautiful, roomy old place that breathes comfort
in spite of continuous disuse. During one neg-
lected period the ballroom was actually used as a
barn, and the smooth dancing floor became dinted
and scarred by hob-nailed boots. Probably the
ill-treated kauri boards will have their furrows
smoothed out now by kind carpenters with planes.
The members of the Sydney Commercial
Travellers’ Cricket Club have been playing on the
South Melbourne Cricket Ground by day, and
theatre-going by night. Last Wednesday even-
ing they invaded Rickards’s, and I noticed that
some bf them had brought pretty wives with
them. I particularly admired the wives’ com-
plexions. Sydney girls, when they are not regu-
lar surfers, have a delicate hothouse look which
distinguishes them from the wind-tanned Mel-
bournians. Complexion-builders are keen on
steam-vapor doses ; so the coastal moist heat of
Sydney must be considered a valuable asset from
a beauty point of view. It so chanced that
Manager Rickards had an interesting programme
for the visitors. The Marbas pair of French
dancers, who do all their talking with their hands
and eyes, were the human stars of the Dill. Bar-
nold’s clever animals were the dog stars. They
raised shrieks of the mincing
hobble-skirter. When a man with a concertina
started to play something from “ Tannhauser,”
the Travellers began to stream out chanting their
war-cry: “We are so dry! We are so dry!”
But the concertina-player rose—or fell—to the
occasion. Dropping Wagner with a thud, he
started to pump out the hilarious chorus. Then
the Travellers smiled again, and stayed to hear
him out.
The Sydney team of commercial traveller
cricketers beat Melbourne out of sight, and there
was a wild finale of dining and smoke-night.
Harry Holden, formerly secretary of the Club in
Sydney, presented the inevitable trophy and a
bouquet of suitable flowers of speech.
There are rows and rows of pretty girls in
“The Gay Gordons”; but they have to merely
hang round while the intricate Scotch jokes are
being sprung on the audience, which wears the
puzzled look of a stoical boxer who can’t exactly
figure out where he’s being,hit. The show would
go better if some of the jests were unravelled a
little and the girls given a better chance. No one
is so dull that he can’t see a pretty girl when she
is served up with plenty of limelight. Manager
Meynell has brought a well-proportioned daughter
with him. Her voice is rather thin ; but as the-
damsel is still in her. very early teens, singing-
teacher Time has plenty of chance to effect im-
provements. She calls herself Miss Mabel Dark
—apparently for no other reason than that she is
divinely fair. The kilt-clad ballets help to re-
lieve the tension produced by the highly-technicali
Scotch jests. There is, besides, a trace of Gil-
bertian humor about the show. An American
girl weeps because she has unwittingly fallen in
love with a title, and an old Scotch dame does
likewise because her adopted child —whom she
spanked cheerfully as plain “Angus”—is proved
to be a belted earl.
The raging bellowdrammer now at the Prin-
cess’s offers one good idea to the woman smoker.
The comedy-man, disguised as a woman, forces
his way into the Princess Ida selectness of a
drapery warehouse where the girls “sleep in.”
Left to himself, he produces a cigarette from the
knob of a monster hatpin, and gets the necessary
match out of the other knob.
Norman Lindsay and Aleck Sass, laden with
luggage and experiences, will totter ashore down
the same liner’s gang plank before this ink is dry,
much to the delight of Australia at large. .At
Fasoli’s, just before holiday time, two other wan-
derers met and compared notes. Charlie Nuttall,
journalist and artist, who has been well appre-
ciated in N’Yark, has returned, to work con-
tentedly in Melbourne. Jimmy Macdonald was
the other home-comer. He is the son of solicitor
Macdonald, and has been in foreign parts for
12 years, half of which he spent in Paris
studying, and the rest in New York teach-
ing millionaires’ daughters the way to put
paint otherwhere than on their cheeks. The spoilt
darling of one Trust king neglected her class
shamefully. “Jimmy” gave several degrees, of
latitude to her, but at last he complained to Mrs.
Dollars. “Why,” exclaimed the millionairess,
“Sadie has been most devoted ! We can’t get
her to think about anything but Art and her
lessons!” A general shake-up all round dis-
covered that several months earlier Miss Sadie
had married on the sly some six-dollar-a-week
Adonis, and the Art school was a grand
screen for the double life. The fat which
was then in the fire blazed so that it
burned a deep hole in Macdonald’s memory.
Peace may have eventually settled on the home
but Jimmy lost a good paying pupil. Jimmy,
by the way, did a bit of marrying himself while
he was away. The girl is a Virginian and a
specialist in child portraits. She is at present
working on a commission from a doting grand-
mother in America, who wants a picture of the
artist’s little son.
Five more sweet girl doctors appeared at the

Gladys Chirnside—daughter of the late Robert
and the lady who is now Mrs. Justice Hodges—is
just back from flatting in London with little Miss
Fenner. The lady recently made one of a tiny
and fearfully exclusive dinner party, given by the
Dudleys in honor of Leopold of Battenburg.
The young widow of poor old Bert Armytage is
back in Melbourne fixing up those hurriedly-left

J. F. Treadway v one of the men who have gob
very rich by selling Melbourne a vast number of
yards of ribbon and covering with it a vast
number of frocks, died at his home at Kew on
New Year’s Day. Practically he was known in
only two circles—the rag trade, which knew him
very well and summed him up as one of the keen-
est of buyers ; and athletic sport, which knew him
pretty well, and often had the help of his heavy
pocket. Thirty years ago he was quite
sure that the time would come when the rag-trade
that was best worth having would be done in the
near suburbs ; and he laid himself out to get it,
and succeeded so well that he probably dies one
of the wealthiest men in the clothes business.
With his friend Fitzgerald he tripped to Java
after a severe illness last year ; but his constitu-
tion was apparently past rebuilding, and a chill
ended the struggle.
Fred B. Norton, who left for another plane at
the end of the year, set out several times on the
last long journey before he flitted for good. First
it would be reported that he had had a breakdown,
and had gone out of town to recuperate; then
serious reports of his illness would drift down
Collins-street and alarm his numerous friends;
almost immediately afterwards, Norton himself
would be discovered somewhere in town smiling
at Rumor and gaily denying that the Man with
the Scythe had been looking for him seriously.
Box Hill was the spot he usually retired to during
his illnesses ; but the end came at pretty Ivanhoe,
on the way to old Heidelberg. During one of his
Box Hill visits, the local bank was invaded by-
armed masked men and robbed. A friend immedi-
ately wired the sick man : “ Halves, Freddie ! ”
' On Thursday a presentation was made to Mrs.
Malcolm, the late secretary of the Trained Nurses’
Association. The beautiful rose-bowl was handed
over to its new owner by Mrs. Ayres, on behalf of
the people who had come in contact with Mrs.
Malcolm during her term of office. Also a marble
clock was forthcoming for daughter Marion, who
had been her assistant. The pleasant little busi-
ness took place at the Swastika Club, which Mrs.
Malcolm is managing ; and several musical items
bucked up the proceedings.
This is the romance of a post office. A boy who
had just entered the service was shown a letter,
simply addressed to Miss Selina Somebody, Mel-
bourne. “ That’s the sort of thing you will have
to learn, young man,” said the senior. “ Have a
look in the directory for a name like that.”
“That’s my aunt’s name,” said the boy ; “she’s
lived with us for years.” So good old auntie, who
had been the faithful drudge of a houseful of care-
less youngsters, came into her own at last, for the
letter was from an old flame who had desired her
hand and heart many years ago. He had pros-
pered, and had written the letter on the off chance
that it would reach the right Selina by some acci-
dent. And the accident happened.
Mrs. Desmond, who travels with the hubby
whose present task is to fill the awful gap left by
Julius Superbus, is a sister of Nance O’Neill;
and she shares the Nance type of frailness in the
matter of build. She was first favorite on the
out-coming ship, but used to shake the barque to
its garboard streak every time she sat firmly on
deck.
The Melbourne Cricket Club has been firing a
farewell salute with champagne corks in honor of
Major Ben Wardill, now in the 60’s, who is re-
tiring from the secretarial job after 30 years’
valuable service. The big ground by the railway,
A great Peace Promoter is Sport. If all

tion from D.C.L. Wisdom, the racial competitive

with its half-circle of towering grandstands, will
not seem the same without him.
Stage dancing is getting further and further
back into the mists of antiquity. Oriental squirm-
ing has had its revival and been discarded in favor
of something still older. Nofru-re, a woman with
a face like Cleopatra, has been appearing in
Baden-Baden in dances alleged to be reprod actions
of the ones performed before Pharaoh, in the temple
of Amon (The Hidden One). Nofru-re has made
a close study of the high reliefs and wall paintings
of Egypt, and has strung the pictured poses into
a complete dance, exactly as a finder of pie-
historic bones reconstructs from them a complete
and awesome monster. She wears her black hair
in a pigtail, with a pudding at the end, and
nothing else worth mentioning except an anklet
on one rosy limb.
The latest fashion is designed for falling avia-
tors. Sometimes, of course, the aviator does not
fall ; but in upper circles it is considered the thing
to dress for it. The descending dress looks re-
markably like grandmother’s crinoline, and an
airman disguised in it bears a strong resemblance
to Charley’s Aunt. The inventor is a young
Berlin “shover.” Put the garment on and it
looks like a very loose ulster ; but take a leap
from your aeroplane, and the thing opens out like
an umbrella, leaving the hands and arms above-
board to manipulate the rubber steering-gear.
Sounds all right so long as you don’t get mixed up
with your wrecked machine.
That old-established culprit, the printer, claims
indulgence for a confusion of “copy,” whereby
Maggie McCann appeared in last week’s Chatter
as the sister of Rita Kiddle, whereas it is really
Mrs. Major Maloney who can claim sisterhood to
Miss Maggie. The tail-end of one paragraph
must have dropped from its moorings and got
hitched to the previous par. Miss Kiddle, as all
squattocracy knows, is the only daughter of the
parental “Billy.”
Said the railway porter :
“What’s that? Glad the holidays are over? Oh, no !
Not at all 1 Half-past 5 a.m. to 11 and 12 p.m. for a
week right off—now would you like that to be over ?
“ It isn’t so much the actual work, but the fool ques-
tions and extra trouble that foolish people give us. It’s
my opinion that only fools travel on holidays ; and they
ali come to us to find out everything. Mostly we send
’em to the Inquiry Olerk. They drive him nearly dotty,
but then he’s paid for it. Lost children are plentiful.
They are sent to the S.M.’s office, and then, if the parents
don’t turn up, the police take them.
“ On Boxing night a small man rushed round asking us
if we had seen his wife. She was lost. We sent him to
the John on the corner. He’s got less to do than we
have. He told us about it after. The little man was
sure she’d got run over or something, and was either in
the hospital or the morgue. She was a shy thing, not
used to battling in a crowd, he said. The John rang up
the watchhouse. She was there—the shy thing. Beer
and battle.
“Yes, women are the worst. They’ll rush into the hall
and ask three or four strangers, one after another, where
they get tickets for Brighton, They don’t want to go to
Brighton at all; Brighton now is the old North Brighton.
They want to go to Beach. But that’s the fault of the
new-fangled changing of names all round. They go and
look at the window, then go and ask the man on the gate
what time the next train goes and which platform it goes
from. The information is stuck up, but that doesn’t
matter. Then they go back and block all other passengers
while thev ask the ticket-clerk. The crowd pushes them
along ; but be'fore they reach the train they have asked
two or three more persons all about it. Yes, like enough
they get there, and home again ; and I suppose they en-
joy themselves.
‘“No, I don’t want a holiday—what I want’s a rest.
No, we don’t get overtime for this, but I’ll get time off to
make up for it later on, if I’m lucky. Then I think I’ll
go to sleep. Anyway, I won’t go anywhere where I’m
liable to be asked what time the 9.40 goes.”
An account of a drawing-room meeting for the
discussion of the Vote, held at the house of another
friend of ours, Lady Brassy, makes amusing
reading because of Lord Brasseey, who was in the
chair, declaring that he “had devoted many
anxious days and sleepless nights to the considera-
tion of this momentous question, and had not yet
finally come to a decision.” Isn’t that a lovely
bit of Brass? Then Mrs. Pankhurst spoke, and
apparently caught and skewered the noble lord’s
views that were dragging their anchors, for when
he replied thanking the lady he as good as
intimated that the country would go to the
demnition bow-wows if it did not give
her the vote. Half a yard of peeresses edged
with peers and other of the slightly-lesser nobility
were at the meeting. That is, half a yard of them
in newspaper print.
The other day I picked up a library copy of
Maurice Drake’s prize novel, “ The Salving of a
Derelict,” and stumbled on the pencil tracks of a
margin scribbler. On page 284, the hero, who
means every word of it, gets this off his chest:
“Man alive, she’s the world to me. I’d lie down
and put her little foot on my throat.” The com-
ment for that impassioned speech is “Bali!”
Again, on page 319, the hard-up heroine, on un-
expectedly getting £l6OO for some old scrip
hitherto considered worthless, uses up a slice of
the small fortune in clothes and amusements:
“She spent nearly £lOO of her new capital in 10
days, and, in satisfying her womanly yearning for
pleasures and pretty things, was able to con-
gratulate herself on havinghadher money’s worth.”
“Cat!” snaps the envious reader. I was doubt-
ful about the scribbler’s sex until I struck that.
The lonely bushwoman bas to meet some big
emergencies single-handed ; and she rarely fails.
Last week an isolated housewife, whose husband
and sons had gone off for the day, was getting
through her work when a flying spark , set the
hessian lining of the house in a blaze. Of course,
there was no time to run for a dish of water, or to
hunt for something to beat it out with. There
was just time to jump at the blazing stuff and tear
it down with bare hands. That is what the plucky
woman tfk?, thus not only saved the house,
but the miles of dry grass outside. Now, in a
bellowdrama, the large adjacent landholder would
gratefully come forward in the fourth act and
insist on paying the wounded heroine’s doctor’s
bill. The occasion seems to demand some sort of
demonstration of the kind, and I hope the adjoin-
ing squatter (if he exists) will perceive that the
fourth act has now arrived.
From “ Rosna,” of Adelaide
Glenelg-on-the Patawaloriga fed the pioneers as usual
on December 28, to celebrate the fact that 74 years ago
Governor Hindmarsh stood under a gum tree and pro-
claimed ns a province. His Ex. was at the 74th feast, as
well as portions of the Ministry, to say nothing of Prime
Minister Fisher, who dropped in from South Africa at the
psychological moment, and added a few sensible words
to the speech list. The plan was adopted for a year or
two of lunching the women pioneers as well as their
brethren ; but we have dropped it, not having had much
encouragement to do anything else.
An interesting visitor at the Commemoration was
Queensland’s Government Botanist, F. M. Bailey. He came
to South Australia in 1839 with his father, who was this
State’s first Government Botanist, and planted our first
baby Botanic Garden. Their original land, down near
Hacknev-road, has been known as Bailey s Garden ever
since. Mr. Bailey’s son, Director of Brisbane’s Botanic
Gardens, is with him in Adelaide.
Amonv our living pioneers about the most remarkable
is T S* Reed, who, at 93, is still secretary to our
Geographical Society, and still a man-about-town and an
active citizen generally. At the moment he is contribu-
ting a series of articles on “ Christmas Contrasts, _ Ihe
Derivation of Words,” and such-like divergent topics to
the daily press.
The two-day?! Christmas meeting of the Port Adelaide
Racing Club was a triumph in the matter of attend-
ance, in spite of the fact that on Monday a fierce hot blast
was throwing’ bricks about the atmosphere. Saturday s
weather was a thing of joy, however, and the pretty
little course was ornamented by a gay and frocky crowd.
Little less than £32,000 went through the totalisator in
the two days. The most exciting circumstance in the
matter of dividends was the £37 which Fastness paid his
faithful. . ..

Adelaide has been full of bowling enthusiasts all the
holidays, the champions from the other States having
come over to dust the landscape with the local kings and
princes of the ancient game. Various revels have de-
voured the visitors’ spare seconds. One day there was
a reception in the Town Hall, with speeches attached.
On Wednesday the party was dragged to Long Gully, one
of our beauty spots, where views run riot. On this occa-
sion, President S. J. Jacobs handed a gold watch from
the S.A. Association to popular penman Clarence Moody,
who has done more for the game in South Aus. than any
other one. . . _ . ,
South Australia has been entertaining the Lari ana
Countess of Harrowby, and a son and daughter. The
Earl is elder brother to Captain Ryder, who once aided
our Ex., and married the C. H. Angases’ daughter Beryl.
The visitors are being entertained with all due ceremonial
and trumpet-flourishing at the Angas homestead, where
the prize oxen come from.
You can now read the enlightening statement in Ade-
laide Sassiety news that Mrs. Blank has taken a house at

From the Oldest Inhabitant
A well-known land mark of old Melbourne has just
been demolished —the shop which was dwarfed by
Alston’s sky-scraper on the corner of Oollins and
Elizabeth streets. The little place was built as far
back as 1845, and in the ’so’s and up to 1861 was occupied
by Edward Arnold, a bookseller. This corner half-acre
was purchased at the first Melbourne land sale (June,
1837) by one Ross, a carpenter and builder. He cut it up
into allotments to suit various people who wanted to
build on it. On the corner Michael Cashmore, a Hebrew,
had a drapery store which was known as No. 1, Mel-
bourne. Cashmore was afterwards the first man to
superintend tiie regular slaughter of meat for the Jewish
community of Melbourne. When Arnold gave up busi-
ness he sold the balance of his lease to the Argus people.
They sent a clerk named Read to open there Melbourne’s
first “block ” agency. A son of the original owner, Ross,
is now an inmate of a home in Melbourne.
“Smith, alias Jones,” sees a stranger :
Last week, in a Sydney street, I saw a bald-headed
bare-headed gentleman sitting in a motor-car, in a yellow
nightie, posing for a camera man. I learned that he was
Sasana-Dhaja, Buddhist monk of the Order of the
Yellow Robe—otherwise Mr. Stevenson,,from Yarmouth,
where the bloaters come from. It seems that he has
taken 10 vows, including absolute poverty and absolute
chastity, and has accepted 225 rules to guide his life ;
that he shaves his head ; that he must wear no hat, no
boots, no shirt—in fact, all he possesses are two yellow
robes, one on and the other at the wash. As he doesn’t
come to Australia to make converts, I expect he does it
to try and forget some of the 10 vows and 225 rules.
They must be very trying to live with.
Sasana, who comes from Burmah, explains that there
are 700 monks and 1000 nuns in his Order. He says i hat
some of the women were charming, with creamy skin,
and beautiful hair hanging below their waists. Now they
shave their heads and walk about bareheaded and bare-
footed, and wear the same yellow robe as the men, with
a skintight chemise over the upper part of their bodies ;
and I don’t know how he knows.
A monk may not look at a woman. He must not look
at money. He must not ride behind horses. (Thank
Heaven for motor-cars !) He must not live under the
same roof as a woman. He muse not kill a flea. He
must not beg, but he goes out in the morning carrying a
little wooden bowl, and if he does not approach the
faithful so that they may put food in his bowl, lm has
cast upon them a curse. And yet Sasana-Dhaja tells us
that the Buddhist monks live beautiful lives, full of holi-
ness and joy. He has never heard of wrong-doing or sin
among them. They have neither sorrow nor pain nor
suffering.
I forgot to mention that he has taken a vow to tell
always the bare, bald, naked truth.

PERFECTLY MOULDED FIGURES.
Another Medical Discovert.
To get out of condition is detrimental to beauty
of form as well as to health. There is .a certain
flabbiness which robs a good figure of charm and
grace. Those who are beginning to grow fat
rapidly are never in the pink of condition. But
here medical science has slipped in with a very
wonderful remedy—one which not only restores a
perfectly moulded form, but renews health and
strength. We give the recipe in full for the
benefit of our stoutish friends :—One ounce of
fluid extract of Glycyrrhiza 8.P., one ounce of
pure Glycerine 8.P., one half-ounce of Marmola,
and Peppermint Water to make six ounces in all.
Any chemist will make up this prescription, or
supply you with the ingredients which you can
mix yourself. The dose is two teaspoonfuls after
each meal. The great virtue of this harmless
remedy is that while the excess fat is being ex-
pelled, the person under treatment has a healthy
appetite and does not need to study dietetics or
go in for tiresome exercises. The whole s3 - stem is
“refreshed ” and invigorated, the blood renewed
and muscular development restored.*

WHAT CONSTIPATION MEANS.
Constipation resembles nothing so much as the
stopping of the sewerage system of a city, and
vou know the outbreak of disease that would
result if this should happen. Then try to realise
the danger to yourself if you allow your bowels to
become clogged. The poisonous matter which
should pass off is absorbed into the blood, which
is the cause of numerous diseases. When you are
troubled this way there is just one thing to do-
get a box of Chamberlain’s Tablets. They cleanse
and invigorate the stomach and bowels, and clear
the system of all foul accumulations and restore it
to a normal condition.*
Barked Your Shins?
Well, try Dr. Sheldon’s Magnetic Liniment; it
will take away all the pain and stiffness, and you
will forget all about it. Price Is. Gd. and 3s.*

CUSTOMER : “ Excuse me, Miss, but what age was
this chicken when it met its death ?”
WAITRESS : “ Well, sir, we don't generally supply
a death certificate with the poultry; hut if
you wait a moment the manager might be
able to fix you up.”
The weird Wimmen’s League of Victoria
is beginning' well. One of its lecturers lately
floated into Cnniperdown (Vic.), and gave the
proposed industrial referenda a stupendous lash-
ing. Firstly, she opined that there would be a
great deal of impersonation at the referenda polls,
and that some of their opponents would probably
vote eight or nine times. Then working up into
a condition of frenzy and falling hairpins, she let
drop these thrilling words: “If such a dreadful
thing as the referendum proposals were carried, I
would not be surprised if it resulted in civil war.
Under Socialism the home will be broken up, and
the children taken away from their parents by the
Government.’’ The sweet exploiter of those dear,
dead old fibs is a perfect lady of the name of
Maise. Which only shows what ill-assorted
matches are made in this world, because the lady
most certainly should have married a gentleman
named Chaff.
Sydney Daily Telegraph last week cried
out at the top of its voice for some prompt
Federal interference with the frozen meat
trade. The nodules—or, to give them
their ugliest name, worm cysts—which
are found in Australian beef have
frightened the London health authori-
ties, who have decreed that affected
meat mustn’t go into consumption
until the mysterious lumps have
been out out. As the regulation
is strictly enforced, much of the
fodder is put up for sale in a muti-
lated state, with the result that the
exporters’ bank balances have had
holes chopped in them. Most of
the affected meat comes from
Queensland ; but as J. Bull is too
busy to worry about details, and
knows only “Australian ” meat, the
whole continent has to suffer for
the Bananaland bullock’s sins. So
even the parish-minded press recog-
nises that the urgent matter is too
big for the States to handle, and
therefore calls out to the Federal Go-
vernment to “ save the position.” Take
it on the whole, it is a remarkably re-
freshing shriek for help, for it indicates
that, after all, the Parish Pump knows
that it isn’t the fire engine it pretends
to be.
The gentle, trustworthy Asiatic again !
Fremantle (W. A.) gaol harbors one specimen of
him, a fiend with 53 convictions, lately sentenced
to a further five years. He should have been de-
ported long ago; but the State won’t, and it
would be a gross interference with precious State
frights if the Commonwealth did the job. So the
fiend stays on, and when he isn’t an expense to
the people he is a menace to them.
The breaking up of the big estates is stir-
ring the dry bones in many a N.S.W. country
town. At least three new country daily papers
are breaking into blossom with the new year.
Tam worth, the northern town which by now
would have had a 25,000 population if the Peel
River Co. and other big landlords hadn’t choked
it. will have one; and Wagga will have two. At
Tam worth the two old tri-weeklies have been
bought by a local co. and amalgamated ; but the
Wagga pair are going to fight it out.
Bigjohn Forrest of Westralia, always a
hefty borrower before the Lord, brightened up
the glad new year by a statement of opinion that
naval and military expenditure shouldn’t be met
out of revenue, but should be charged to loans.
Surely the man who would borrow to pay a sailor’s
wages, or to liquidate the bill for an ironclad,
would borrow for anything beneath the sun.
Even a town hall has points about it as a loan
asset compared with a warship. It doesn’t get
shot at as a general thing, and it doesn’t go to sea
and sink in deep water.
Brisbane Tory papers remark mournfully
on the alacrity with which Queensland State civil
servants seize any opportunity of getting trans-
ferred into the Federal service. The latest example
is H. D. Brennan. Public Service Inspector, who
has just been appointed a Deputy Land-Tax Com-
missioner. In spite of Phidston, and Wade, and
Wilson, and the “National” Ass, the State public
servants know that the powers of the Common-
wealth will grow, while those of the States will
shrink, and they naturally seek the bigger oppor-
tunities and the bigger outlook of the Australian
service.
“ T. Tuffchunter” : Possibly Colonel Gos-
low, who lately gave a Sydney harbor picnic to
some hundreds of bis political supporters, has
been reading a pamphlet issued by the Tory
crowd in England : “ How to Win an Election ;
or the Workers’ Guide,” recommended by the
Tory leader Balfour. It says: “The average
working man has two talismans which appeal
most powerfully to his heart. They are beer and
baccy.” It, therefore, recommends giving smok-
ing concerts, with beer, as a good form of
“association work.” But whether the Colonel
has been reading the pamphlet or not. I hope
his guests liked the beer and baccy they con-
sumed, and are properly grateful to the aw—
giver.
One Nathan, of Sydney, writes to the
papers concerning the Commonwealth land tax
under the heading: “How Labor Hits Labor.”
Nathan’s story is that the rich property-owner is
not only going to pass the tax on to the poor
tenant —“ he is going to add a little to it, so as
to derive a profit from it in addition to making
political capital out of it.” And, having- described
the swindle, Nathan heads it: “ How Labor Hits
Labor.” In the same way, if Nathan were robbed,
he would, no doubt, write to the papers blaming
the police for it, and hinting that the force ought
to be abolished.
David Storey’s new Democratic party in
N.S.W. starts with one asset, anyway. It has
secured the active hostility of Sydney Telegraph.
The Telegraph upheld Freetrade. and it fell
dead ; it went bald-headed for Anti-Socialism, and
the cause expired ; it urged the people to stand
bv the Fusion, and the Fusion was routed ; it
preached Dreadnausea, and the scheme blew out
in a gale of derision. At different times the D.T.
has furiously opposed an Australian navy, uni-
versal service, arbitration and conciliation, a
land tax, old age pensions. Labor in the Aus-
tralian Parliament and the N.S.W. Assembly, and
about 178 other successful causes. It has come to
be a Parliamentary axiom that “ the Telegraph’s

courages him to come on and do his worst.
Private Enterprise is still fuming over the
starting of the State coal mine in Victoria. The
other day the chairman of the Outtrim Howitt
Co. wound up the usual complaint of unfairness
and mismanagement by asserting that if Private
Enterprise were allowed to take up leases on the
field, his co. would soon supply the public with
coal at a lower price than the State could do it.
The trouble with virtuous Private Enterprise is
that it won’t give the public this cheap service
when it has the chance. For instance, the Mel-
bourne Tramway Co. made a profit of £172.902
last year; it could have charged the public
£150.000 less, and still have pocketed 7 per cent,
on its outlay. But did it reduce the fares, so. as
to cut out the £150,000 this current year ? Did it?

Sydney Daily Telegraph was patronising
concerning “ the first utterances of the Common-
wealth Prime Minister on his return from South
Africa” ; and it spoke in a large, impressive way
about our “ world-encircling Empire, with a com-
mon ideal and a common destiny.” Where it is
a question of a nebulous, grandiose affair like
Imperial unity, the Telkgiiaph can be as broad as
a smoking-room anecdote. But when it is a
question of Australian unity—a common-sense,
practical proposition, the like of which Fisher
has just seen in actual operation in S’Africa—the
D.T. can't “ widen its range of vision ” an inch.
It froths about “ a world-encircling empire with
a common ideal and a common destiny,’ and
yearns to see the self-governing portions of it
know each other better; yet the mere thought of
a unified Australia, shorn of the idiotic jealousies
and differences created by State Frights, almost
causes the paper to break down and sob.
That most disastrous person, N.S.W.
Attorney-General Holman, is still busy remitting
various fines imposed on union secretaries for
breaches of the Electoral Act. The remissions
themselves, perhaps, don’t amount to very much ;
the worst trouble lies in the remarks that Holman
has made about them. When the amazing blun-
derer described as “well-meaning enthusiasm’'
the action of a supporter who had incited a woman
to commit forgery in order to get certain names
on the roll, he convinced people that he was pre-
pared to look very leniently upon roll-stuffing—
at least when it was done in the interests of his
own crowd—and that political corruption was
going to have an easy, rosy time. Also, he pro-
vided a notable handle for the enemy, and inci-
dentally added a new enrichment to the political
vocabulary. Even Wade, who is something of a
bungler himself, wasn’t so foolish as to describe
baker McKye’s offence as “ well-meaning enthu-
siasm.” It' will be a longtime before the party
fully recovers from that remark.
One Fritch, a Denver (U.S.A.) business
man, who arrived in Australia a few days ago,
thus conducts the case for the prosecution against
the trusts and monopolies that suck his country
dry :
The railway trusts have got us in the hollow of their
hands. My customers blame me for selling nails at a
dollar-fiftv, but they cost me a dollar-forty to get. We
have coal mines, too. We pay the miner a dollar a ton
to get the coal, and the railways charge a dollar-ten to
haul it, and by the time it gets to us we have to pay
three or four dollars for it. It’s the same with cante-
loupes. Some people think canteloups are wild animals,
but thev’re not—they’re just fruit. Ten cents apiece to
the grower—lo cents more to the railways—3o cents to
the consumer. Beet the same, and potatoes. Where does
the grower come in ? But we must have railways what-
ever they charge.
Luckily, Australia isn’t in the grip of the railway
octopus ; but the tentacles of other species of tire
beast are busy getting a hold, and the Denver man
comes opportunely to urge the necessity of voting
for the axe when the monopoly referendum arrives
next April.
Melbourne Argus rebukes Lloyd-George
for an attack on the House of Lords, and runs on:
The hereditary principle, so easy to ridicule by theories
of pure democraev—vet scientifically not quite indefen-
sible—was the subject of the Chancellor’s special assault.
So, hooray ! The Peers are saved ! Legislative
capacity can be handed down from father to son.
True, in this case there’s no proof of legislative
capacity in the fathers; but that is a side issue.
Contrasting the Australian Senate as a democratic
institution with the House of Lords, the Akgus
continues : “If ever a Chamber has disappointed
the expectation of Constitution builders, it is the
Senate of the Commonwealth. . . . No other
second Chamber has ever been such a failure.”
To demonstrate this beyond cavil, the daily Tory
points out that the Senate has passed practically
the whole batch of measures sent up by the House
of Reps. In short, it has obeyed the orders and
realised the expectations of the electors, whereas
it is notoriously the duty of second Chambers to
kick the people’s wishes downstairs.
The anger of the true-blue “Liberals” of
N.S.W. who are cursing David Storey and his'
little “ cave ” is all the more delightful when it is
remembered that those who are most angry are
the people who have always been most horrified
at the “machine” politics of the Labor party.
Now, when David the Hatter says he’s going to
vote as he pleases and not as Wade pleases, the
Daily Telegraph and others simply howl at him,
and want to know what he means by being an
“ intriguing middleman ” and other kinds of dis-
graceful character.
Testimonial to the land tax given by
Rear-Admiral Bridges, just back from Europe :
Then there is this drastic land tax. There is no ques-
tion that it is to a very large extent responsible for the
feeling in England on the part of those with land in-
terests here, that the best thing they can do is to get
out. They are disgusted.
Nothing better could be said of any land law than
that it disgusts the absentee landlord —the curse
of every country. For the employer, the
captain of industry, the man who joins his
brains to his workmen’s muscle and skill,
much may be said. For the absentee land-
lord, who puts no brains into the business
of growing wheat or wool, but merely levies toll
on those who do the labor and supply the brains,
nothing can be said except in the language of
curse and execration. That remark of Bridges
should be worth more than a trifle to the immi-
gration agent in England—and Ireland especially.
Melbourne Argus, on ibe New Era in
Federal legislation, bemoans the fact that—
The old path has been deserted, and the Common-
wealth has set but on a new road, altogether strange and
unknown, without even the experience of other nations
to act as a guide over some of the most doubtful parts
of it.
In the eyes of the Tory nothing can be so deplor-
able, or even damnable, in government as the
exploiting of new ideas. There should be no new
departures in legislation, no venturing from the
old path, no advance beyond the limits of prece-
dent—-and, therefore, no progress. What has
never been should never be, world without
end, amen. Novelties in commercial enter-
prise, inventions in labor-saving mechanics,
and experiments in practical science are
admirable from the bluest-Tory point of view;
but novelties in statesmanship are pardonable
only when they go to strengthen the rule of Capi-
tal and put Labor in its proper place. In short,
Governments were designed by Providence to bp
the slaves of Experience. When they break the
chains of precedent and reach out todosomething
previously unattempted they are rebels, traitors
to the cause of stagnation, and enemies of estab-
lished fact. The Conservative press can’t order
the offenders to the scaffold or burn them at the
stake ; but it shakes its palsied head at their high
treason, and hopes devoutly for the worst.
A LOADED REPLY.

The country manufacturer in N. S. Wales
strikes a snag in the railways, whose freight-
charges are designed to boost Sydney and further
bloat the already over-bloated city. Thus the
freight on brewers’ raw material from Sydney to
Wellington is—malt, £1 3s. sd. per ton; sugar,
15s. per ton ; hops, £3 12s. Bd. per ton ; while the
freight on the same raw materials in the shape of
beer from Sydney to Wellington is £1 Bs. sd. per
ton. In general it costs about £2 per ton to take
ii truckload of manufactured machinery from
Sydney to (say) Temora, while it runs to about £4
per ton to take the raw material the same way.
Against this sort of thing the country manufac-
turer kicks for a while; then he either goes down
and out, or saves the remnants of his business by
shifting to the city, and making the State look
more like a tadpole than ever.
GIVING SATISFACTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Though the Victorian Parliament has not this year
done anything particularly stimulating in legislative
achievement, the session is closing much more auspici-
ously for the Ministerial party than it began.—Argus
(2,1/ 12/’lO ).
We have not toiled like anything
Nor rushed around like scalded ants,
Nor strained, nor heaved, nor tried to bring
The energy of elephants
Upon our daily job. But there !
Why should we work? God will provide,
So long as things are As They Were
And good old Fat is satisfied !
We have not worked like blazes, nor
Moiled as the busy bee doth moil ;
We have not killed one single bore,
Nor boiled the Upper House in oil;
We have not plugged along the track
Which leads to better days for those
Who are not Fat; but. . . forth and back
The House-cat leaps on anxious toes.
Still Fat is fed ; still we remain
His only—body, soul and boots.
From graft we've managed to refrain,
Despite Victoria’s heartfelt hoots ;
Fat loves to see our sort of drone
Work hard at working points, and play
At toil, and thus awhile postpone
The work that must be done—some day.
Still Fat is satisfied with us,
Although we’ve vowed, each day, “I will
Not work ! ” —for best we please him thus ;
The sweated soul, rebellions, still
Gives Fat each day his daily bread :
Still Stout retains his dirty pride. ..
Who wants to try and push ahead
With Stout-and-selfish satisfied ?

RHEUMATISM.
Rheumatism is generally regarded as one of the
most difficult ailments to cure, and invariably
medicines are tried simply with the hope of tern-
w Al LWft
porary re-
lief. Dr.
Morse’s In-
dian Root
Pills have
been won-
derfully
8 u ccessful,
not by mere-
ly affording
a cessation
of the pain,
but by re-
storing the
joints to
their origi-
nal supple-
ness. Used
in conjunc-
tion with
Comstock’s
Nerve and
Bone Lini-
ment, the
most stubborn cases of rheumatism, lumbago
and sciatica have been overcome. In the case of
Miss King, Union Street, Foxton, N.Z., related'
by her mother, the results exceeded expectations.
She says : “My daughter suffered acutely from
rheumatism in the arms and hips, which caused
her a great deal of pain, especially during wet
weather. Having tried many remedies for rheu-
matism, all of which proved useless, she went on
suffering until advised to try Comstock’s Nerve
and Bone Liniment, which was used in conjunc-
tion with Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills. After
the first bottle we noticed a great improvement,
so we persevered with the treatment, and used
four bottles in all, when all signs of rheumatism
left and have never returned since. I cannot speak
too highly of your Nerve and Bone Liniment, and
can also recommend Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills as a grand corrective for all common ail-
ments.”
The Liniment is sold by all leading chemists
and storekeepers, or will be posted at same price,

SPORTING
NOTIONS
At the Sydney Stadium gate receipts are
swelling like the head of Clabby, welter-weight boxer
from America, and hippo-weight air-merchant from
VVindville. Which statement is satisfactorily proved by
the proceedings on Dec. 28, when Tim Land, of Australia,
met Johnny Thompson, of Yankeeland, at catch weights.
Considerable breath and ink have been expended, not
to say wasted, in admiration of the scrap. This
paper does not propose to add to the heap,
principally because it reckons the fight for the most part
wasn’t worth a cocoanut, unless the cocoanut was used
to express disapproval. It (the fight, not the cocoanut)
went 19J rounds, and about three-quarters of them were
given over to the American wrestle, which is the chief
asset of the man who relies entirely on abnormal
powers of endurance for victory. Thompson learned
in about one round that his cake was dough
in a boxing count-up, and that a knock-dut
was the single and solitary hope he had. So
he wrestled, and bored in, and poked hard with short
jabs to the body, and leaned on Land with all his might
and main and every other oz. of avoirdupois he had avail-
able. The local man, handicapped by a permanently stiff
leg, was unable to side-step as he should, and wag con-
tinually cornered and loaded up with imported
American. And it was impossible to punch the
American off. The punishment was severe enough
to stop a mule, but Thompson took it.,as the
front door of the suburban residence takes the banging
of the rent collector when the family is pretending to be
out. As the rounds went on these tactics wore Land
down and weakened him till he couldn’t do further
damage. Then Thompson came into his own, and started
to batter out the used-up enemy. In the 19th round
Land went to the floor heavily ; but the gong gave him
another chance. It was clear, however, that only a
miracle, or hanging on to the American in the approved
American manner, would carry him through the next,
and as there didn’t happen to be any miracles about, and
as the American methods haven’t come into fashion in
this sporting country, Land was outed half-way through,
after a brilliant showing against an accumulation of odds.
The most exciting feature of the battle was
Clabby, who was acting as second to his countryman
Thompson. This young man, like the rest of the.
American string, has been allowed so much lati-
tude by a management with a lately-acquired ver-
micelli backbone that he hated to see a referee
handling the light when he (Clabby) could handle
it so much better by himself. When Land was knocked
down in the 19th round the gong clanged before the fatal
“out” was counted. In any case, Land was rising in
time to save himself, but Clabby reckoned, apparently,
that Referee Baker should disregard the rules and award
the fight to Thompson on the ground that it was getting
late, or it might rain or something. His attitude in
Thompson’s corner was such tha/t he should have been
ordered out by Baker, and too m uch abuse cannot be
hurled at the management for permitting its controlling
officer, who had been through an exceptionally heavy trial
all night, to be insulted by a ring-side pug. As a matter
of fact, the position became so intolerable, and so insult-
ing was Clabby immediately after the khock-out, that
Baker was forced to crack him hard on the jaw.
* * * *
The present crowd of visiting boxers are not
likely to improve the already damaged opinion of the
Yankee as a sportsman. Papke may be well within his
rights in taking precautions to prevent his real weight
leaking out; but what was- his object in keeping his
weight secret? Obviously he has something to conceal,
and in this game concealment is prima facie evidence of
humbug at the very least. Papke professes to be wildly
anxious for another match with David Smith. Now is
Smith’s opportunity. Let. Papke put his alleged cham-
pionship on the table and let the match be for that, if
he can make the weight at the ringside. Some of Papke’s
friends say there isn’t enough money in Australia to give
Papke a decent purse for a fight for the championship.
But the real trouble is that there is too much meat about
Mr. Papke to allow him to fight for that blessed cham-
pionship.
* * * *
After a long course of raw bash served up at the
Stadium (Sydney) without trimmings, the batter supplied
on New Year’s Night by Mehegan (Vic.) and Bronson
(America) came as a light lunch to over-taxed digestions.
These two met to contest the Lightweight Championship
of Australia; both weighed under lOst. and were reason-
ably matched otherwise. The ensuing battle was the
most interesting, clean and clever that has been seen
at Rushcutter’s Bay this season. In-fighting and wrestle-
walloping were entirely eliminated, and the pair fought
out a manly, scientific 20-round bout, and were repeatedly
cheered for their fair, even courteous, behavior towards
each other. It was a night of goodwill. Even “ Snowy ”
Baker (referee) and Clabby shook hands. Both Mehegan
and Bronson are skilled boxers, although their styles are
very different : but Mehegan is the superior. He has a
most infernal left, and on Monday night he could
have hired it out as a piston rod to a ferry
steamer. His weakness lay in not moving in
quickly to swat the occasionally demoralised foe.'' A
less exasperatingly deliberate man would have won on a
knock-out half-way through the argument, instead of
winning on points at the end of 20 rounds. Bron Son
hasn’t enough poundage behind his deliveries ; also he is
far too amiable a fighter, refusing tb take advantages
that have been legitimately’ earned. There was no doubt
whatever as to the winner, and Mehegan looks likely' to
be the caretaker of the Australian light-weight champion-
shin for some time to come.

Brisbane had its first view of a big fight on
Boxing Day, when Maorilander Devitt and Clabby’, the
Yankee, met at the Edward»street Stadium to argue the
welterweight championship, and it reckons it saw nothing
to blow about. The affair lasted two minutes. After
being punched four or five times, Devitt fell, and while
the referee was counting off the seconds,'the crowd in-
vited him to get up. He obliged them when the count
had reached nine, and made a wild rush at Clabby ; but
got a short right punch on the chin that outed him.
Then the crowd swore and went to the races^
The Ma State’s cricket victory in Melbourne
didn’t come as a startling surprise. Admittedly the
Cornstalks were a superior lot, while the Vies, were
several degrees below normal. Bardsley played the best
and easiest cricket for his 124. Trumper’s 142 was more
desultory. Barbour wielded a very attractive bat for his
82. The quaintest batsman of the. 22 was McElhone,
whose nervous poking provoked ironic cheers. But he
walloped with greater ardor in his second strike, and
fielded without a fault. The greatest fielding, though,
was that of Matthews, who did two men’s work —and he’s
only a little chap, too. And, on top of that, he smacked
up 39 and 50 not out, besides dismissing three ot the
enemy for 89. After that they simply hid to push some
old fellow out to let him into the Test eleven.
V'* * *
B. Kortlang, who batted so well for his side in
the N.S. VV.-Vic. match, making top score in the first and
third highest in the second innings, threatens to arrive
at last. Though still a comparative youngster, Kortlang
has had a large experience at the game. First, he played
for a church team at Prahran (Vic.), his birthplace ; then
he wandered away and taught the Yankee how to bat,
while playing for clubs in ’Frisco, N’Yark, Philadelphia,
Baltimore, Bawst’n ; also, he was picked as America’s
wicket-keeper against an English team in ’O7. S’Africans
Schwarz and Snooke also had a hand in that game. After
.that Kortlang skipped across and played in Canada;
next he qualified for Surrey ; then he went to China. In
’OS he was back in Australia and played with Balmain
(N.S.YV.); and in’Q9 he was in Vic. once more, keeping
his end -up for Essendon. Yet, barring the American
episode, he was never picked to play for his State or
country till ’O9 ; but since then his big cricket average
reads: 23 innings, nine n. 0., 197 highest score, 1434 runs,
102'4 average.

Australia has never lost a Test match in Ade-
laide since the season 1891-2, when Grace’s XI, after
being beaten in Melbourne and Sydney, batted for two
days on a hard wicket, and then, after a wet Sunday, ran
through Australia twice on the Monday. There were
only three Tests to a season in those days.
* * •* *
Tasmania called in at Sydney the other day
and asked the Ma State if it knew anything about
cricket. The Ma. State did, and tossed. But Tasmania
won the spin ; and, looking at the weather, its skipper
sent theMa State to the wickets, where N.S.W. promptly
knocked up 406. It was a -fearsome score —the
sort that leaves a helpless feeling behind it. And
Tassy had the feeling badly, for when its turn at the
wickets came the weather had got worse, the light
was bad, and the outlook was hopeless. The best
the Fiyspeck team could do was pile up 49 for the whole
side, no less than four vanishing under the sign of the
waterfowl. This left the Island State team 357 behind on
the first innings, so the crowd following on put on another
244, which left it still 113 short on the first innings.
N.S.W. thus won by that number of runs and a whole
innings. It was a bad beating.
* * # *
The second Test between Australia and South
Africa commenced in Melbourne last week. Hill, win-
ning the toss, sent Trumper and Bardsley in to score.
And they did, but not so sensationally as they are
wont to do these times. Trumper’s wicket fell
for 34, when the combination had yielded 59. Hill
took the vacant crease, and by lunch they had
lifted the Australian score to 144. After lunch
Llewellyn smashed Hill with a neat thing that was head-
ing for anywhere but the wicket, but which, touching
the ground, curled round the batsman’s legs right on to
the middle stump. It was a Bobbydazzler. Gehrs came
and went, leaving four on the board ; and the score dropped
or soared, as one looks at it, from 1 for 144,t0 four for 164.
Five fell for 188, Armstrong added 75, and after that
the end came quickly, the side vanishing for 348. Africa
went to the,sticks right aw&y, and at close of play had
bashed up 17 without losing any timber. On Monday
Australia learned that Africa is the home of most
new things. The Springboks changed their methods
and played ancient Henry with the Australians
in a way that made Hill weep tears of blood.
Faulkner carried his bat for 188, and the score
stood at five for 352 when the day gave out. On
Tuesday the Australians were to receive a greater shock.
As this issue was going to press Faulkner had lifted his
score to 204 and departed, and tlij? innings was over for
506. As this issue went to press, Australia had lost one
wicket in the second innings for-35. And, worse luck,
that wicket was Bardsley’s.
* * * *
N.S.W., Vic., and South Aus. Cricket Asso-
ciations having agreed, three months’ residence will in
future be necessary to qualify- players for Sheffield Shield
cricket. The innovation is a huge brick aimed at the
practice of pushing in English and other players who may
happen along, and biffing out Australians to make room
for them. The new law is good from all points of view.
**, * *
T. S. Warne, the Carlton (Vic.) professional
cricketer, will have a “ benefit” in Melbourne on March
10, when the Australian XI. v. the Rest of Australia will
strive to rake in a decent purse. Why “testimonial”
matches are introduced into Australia, where players in
“test’’and other matches receive good remuneration,
isn’t apparent; and the various Cricket Associations and
the Board of Control should keep a weather-eye on the
expansion of this nefarious practice.

Queensland’s cricket success against N.S.W. at
Brisbane and Sydney, and against Victoria in Melbourne,
heaves another clod at the door of the Board of Control
in connection with its refusal to let the Northern State
join in the Sheffield Shield struggle. South Aus. basin
recent years been the loud-mouthed objector against
Bananaland’s inclusion on the score of distance ; but the
hammering at the door is making a big npise. However,
as the'other State's have no objection, the Board, by a
majority decision, will possibly decide to admit the
younger brother.

Sydney cricketer B. Folkard, who was under-
stood to have been dropped for weariness in the field,
made a fearsome splash at Yass on Monday last. Playing
with a Sydney team he smacked up 100 of a total score
of 392, and then battered down seven Yass wickets for
eight runs. The whole side went for 14. It was a
debacle.
* * * *
These are the days of remarkable cricket per-
formances. At Wellington (N.S.W.), last week, a team
from Orange was dismissed for three runs, one of which
was scored by that old and reliable player, Sundries.
*But at Christchurch team and Sundries
combined to make a solitary run. Which was a record
breaker and a world beater.
* , * * *
If Tasmania cannot play cricket it flatters it-
self it knows something about bowls. The historic and
ancient pastime is the game for ancient Tasmania. So
when the Victorians called in last week they were promptly
seized, taken to the bowling green and had their noses
rubbed in the turf, the margin being five points in three
games. The joy in Tasmania threatens to wake up that
Garden of Sleep.

Once again the rumor that the Sydney Thou-
sand will be revived in March next is causing thrills
through the souls of those who follow the wheel. Well,
in spite of all the tricks and swindles that were worked,
we had a great time in Sydney when the Thousand was
booming. What nights they were ! And who can ever
forget the sight when the riders for the Five Miles came
wandering round the track, 30 or 40 of them, running
lightly into place for the start. Yes, most of us would
be glad to see another Sydney Thousand meeting. And,
probably after the long rest the game has had, it would pay
if it were made anything like the spectacular affair of the
davs a-rear. The League of Wheelmen professes to know
nothing of any revival, and the crowd that ran it before
speaks likewise. Every now and again, with tlie wish the
father of the thought, there starts again the rumor that
the world’s greatest bike race will be revived. But the
rumor .never comes to anything, and the dim, mysterious
people who are said to be working it updn the shadow of
anonymity never arrive at the place where the light
shines, and toss over the cash which will make the thing
go. Probably this rumor is the same as those which have
gone before.

“Quill Chauffeur”: Re motoring records at-
tacked (D. 29/12/10) by “Hermes” with a pen dipped
in gall and vitriol. This looks suspiciously like
an attempt to discount the praiseworthy modesty
of White (who succeeded) and Camphin (who
didn’t), both of whom reckoned it- was good
enough to talk after, instead of before, the event.
White gave fall publicity to the fact that Custanee
accompanied him on all his record runs, and Whitburn, a
mechanic, was with Day on his successful run, a certain
much self-advertised motorist having proved a Jonah in
the three previous attempts. Anyhow, why drag: in
Kellow, whose performance has been many times
eclipsed? Writer reckons that White, an independent
crank, who was his own financier and used his own old
touring car, is the man to whom the alleged glory pro-
perly belongs, seeing that he has won through at the first
try every time. Camphin, a struggling trader, deserves
credit for his pluck and persistence in the face of a bent
front axle and broken spring ; and all the alleged railway
gatekeepers in the Ma State cannot detract from the fact
that he had reached Wallan—26 miles from his goal—with
over an hour to spare, when his petrol tank went wrong*

Racing—at Sydney, anyhow—seems to have
degenerated into a mere money-making pastime for
gentlemen of the ring. The Tattersall’s Club meeting at
Randwick was the same disastrous circumstance to
backers as all the other races have been of late. The
horses that carried public money to the front carried it
at such ridiculous rates that all trace of equity dis-
appeared from the bet. But in most cases the horses
that got home started at about eight to one ; and when
the bookmaking fraternity bet anything near eight to one
against winning nags, it is sure evidence that nobody,
save perhaps an owner or tw-o, is on those nags. Sydney
horse-racing courses will be good places to keep away
from till the bookmaker has been abolished in favor of the
decent and automatically-correct totalisator.
BILLY PAPKE,
who mislaid
his world's
champion-
ship at the
Sydney
Stadium
the other
evening.
Just consider some of the prices. In the Second
Hurdle Race, Farrell, the second horse, and Pharos, who
fell, went out at two to one and five to two against, re-
spectively. Handspike, the Avinner, started at 12 to one
against; which is a fair indication that the public vvas
not on Handspike. Poi Dance’s win of the Flying
Welter was a genuine case of a favorite get-
ting home, but the best price going was six
to four against him; which was a mighty liberal
price for the bookmaking fraternity. New Year’s Gift
was one for the bookmakers. Of the 10 starters the
public practically pinned its faith to the horse that ran
third—Leuron, the five-year-old, by True Blue from
Early Bird. The rankest outsider on the list wasNangar.
Nobody Avanted him. Not a soul would have him. So
Patrick Shortodds howled l 2 to one against Nangar
in vain. He proved a skinner. For Tatt.’s Club Cup,
a fairly heavily-gilded affair, with £lOOO added money,
15 faced the starter, and Byplay and Jinnee carried the
public money at two to one and seven to two. Byplay
won, and thus provided the only instance in which the
public got back anything from the gentleman with the
bag.' So great was the shock that the daily press arose
with a wild, triumphant screech to inform the world that
Byplay had hauled the backers through—made up all
losses of a whole day on one race at two to one against.
Bah 1 Also rats and 10,000 devils.

Nothing comes amiss to Lynch’s stable since it
captured the Melbourne Cup with Comedy King. In the
Hopetoun Cup at Caulfield on Boxing Day, the colors of
Lynbh'on Prizefighter scored a dead heat for first place
with Diabolo, whilst stable-companion Dhobi was only a
neck behind the pair. Both of Lynch’s horses went out
at If) to 1, and later in the day the stable brought off a
luclty 8 to 1 chance with Late Hours.

S.A. racecourses put £453,000 through the
totalisator in 1910, £42,000 more than the year before,
which was a “ record ”so far. There is no safer proof of
general prosperity in the State. The largest sum at one
meeting was £55,737, for the three daj’s of the Birthday
Cup. The largest sum in one day was the £26,710 put
through at Onkaparinga. The various racing clubs re-
ceived £34,000 as commission, and the State Government
took £11,300, waggishly called “ stamp duty.”

Died at Wellington (N.S.W.), Saturday morn-
ing, T. S. Clibborn, full of years and honors. He had
reached the ripe age of 73, and for at least 40 years had
enjoyed a really good time. He played "his part, he
drank his wine, and he took the benefit of his life.
And when he retired from office, the A.J.C., of
which for nearly half a century he had been the
outward and visible sign, granted him an annuity, and
changed the name of one of its races to the Clibborn
Stakes. What more could a racing secretary desire ? His
body was buried in the family sepulchre at South Head
Cemetery. A curious coincidence was that he was the
last of tlie first trustees of Rushcutter’s Bay Park. Re-
cently the Trust was dissolved, and the park taken over
by the City Council, and on the day when the Trust
ceased to exist in law Mr. Clibborn died.
* * * *
After a week of battling on Sydney courts,
N.S. W. Lawn Tennis country championships sorted them-
selves out into a win for Artnidale. The final was be-
tween the winner and Dubbo, and Armidale overwhelmed
Dubbo by seven sets 46 games to one set 21 games. Then
the countrymen became presumptuous enough to try a
racquet with a metropolitan team. The walloping was
bad, the metropolis scoring six sets 38 games to 22 gaines
only. The week did not reveal any players wasting
sweet quality on the country air. In fact, unless the
country player bucks up somewhat, the fixture will have
to be ab andoned.
This lack of new and rising players is the canker
at the root of the game in Australia. In the United
States it Is different. There the new players are rising
so fast it is difficult to hold them down. Beales Wright,
who will be remembered in Australia, and who was atone
time the tennis champion of the whole Federation, re-
cently found himself beaten by a quite young and unknown
player, E. M. McLoughlin. Other great scalps fell to the
Me' man ; but a few days later Wright regained his
superiority, and just managed to beat McLoughlin.
Then, in his second round, a 17-year-old lad made Wright
play four sets to win ; and, in the fourth, Reuben A.
Holden, jun., had him all out. T. W. Hend-
rick was extended for five sets, and had all
his work cut out in five sets to beat a 15-
year-old boy. These are exceptional cases, perhaps ; but
everywhere the same tendency is noticeable. The young
men are coming on faster than the old ones are decaying.
Here in Australia we have Brookes and Wilding, who really
belong to Maoriland. But we have no one coming along
who shows the slightest sign of being able to defend the
Davis Cap when Brookes and Wilding have gone the way
of all champions.
**■*+■
The death of R. F. Doherty is not encouraging
to strenuous lords of the tennis court. R. F. Doherty
and his brother were as pre-eminent in their time—from
1897 to 1907—as the Renshaws had been in the 80’s and
early 90’s of last century. One or both of the Renshaws
died long ago. Tennis is a great game to play—in
moderation. As an all-round test of skill, activity,
alertness, resourcefulness, temper and dogged pluck in
the performer it far surpasses cricket or baseball; but
for the man who practises it as a profession, rather than a
pastime, it is seemingly the most killing of athletic
sports.
* « * *
Evidently the Ma State has no distance ped
capable of keeping time with J. Fitzgerald, the Cana-
dian. The five miles’ professional championship at
Sydney Sports Ground last week was the softest of good
things for the visitor ; he got so far ahead that Hopping
threw in the towel, and the Canadian finished alone in
27min. 37sec. This week he rubbed home the truth of
the foregoing by annexing the mile championship of
Australia in 4min. 25sec. He was 220yds. to the good
from H. McCabe and Hopping.
* * * *
Australian sprinter Jack Donaldson doubtless
made Reg Walker sorry he threw over his amateur
status when the South African was defeated last week
for the World’s Professional Championship at Johannes-
burg. The time is alleged to be 9fsec. —an effort which
left little time for Walker to think on the way.
# * * *
Quite possible that Australia may welcome in
A. Stanbury another candidate for the sculling cham-
pionship. He is a younger brother of the once mighty
“ Jim,” with plenty of beef and strength. Although at
the recent N.S.W. championship regatta he didn’t show
to much advantage in the lumpy sea, his supporters are
very sanguine about his rowing ability. J. R. towns
won the title from A. Priddle, with A. Stanbury and ;A.
Green in the rear ; and a small piece of record i that all
competitors claim relationship with ex-champion scullers.
Detailed accounts of the Webb-Pearce sculling
match show that Webb put up a much better struggle
than the earlier cables suggested. We were given to
understand that Pearce led from start to jump for the
finishing line, whereas at one time Webh was actually ni
front and going like a rocket ; but Pearce passed him,
and after that held him with comparative ease. Webb
owned up after the race that he is not w'hat he used to
be. It is the doom of man that his champion-
ship days are few; and Webb’s are gone for ever.
He must now repose in the reflected light of
his past glory. Meantime an agitation for a meeting
between Pearce and Arnst has broken out, and in the
course of the barracking some tall things are being said
in the endeavor to prove that the question of whether
Arnst or Pearce is the better man is surrounded by an
atmosphere of grave doubt —doubt that harrows the
public heart and sears its brain centres, keeping it awake
o’ nights—doubt that can be removed only by a struggle
on the Parramatta. The struggle will apparently even-
tuate, as Arnst is willing to meet Pearce, and even row
him.
* * * *
The gods who control the Ma State’s swimming
legions might do worse than look round for someone to
help Cecil Healy uphold the Ma end of the log at the big
carnival at the Municipal Baths in Woolloomooloo Bay
next month. Healy is swimming better than ever before,
but there are fears that by the time he has to meet Beau-
repaire he will have gone stale. Some private trials in
the harbor baths of late have revealed that young Frank
Fittes, who some years ago threatened to do things, is
now at the height of his powers. Although not in proper
training, he is swimming excellently, and showing phe-
nomenal speed, and, as he has been residentin N.S.W. for
nearly two years, the Ma State’s swimming crowd might
find it worth while to take an interest in him.
There is a story around Tamworth that Bill
Squires has recovered his punch. In a disturbance there
recently six coves, blokes and cobbers attacked him, aqd
were smashed up in short order but with great thorough-
ness. Only one escaped by instantaneous flight, and
after finishing off the others Squires is said to have
started in pursuit in a way that proves he is anything
but decadent physically. Whether the fugitive was over-
taken has not transpired ; but as Bill is still at large it
means probably that the fugitive got clear. William was
fined a bob each— with apologies from the Bench, whose
sympathies were plainly with thejiuneher.
The bounding idiot who trespasses on the track
has been at it again. This time at Gilgai, five miles from
Inverell (N.S.W.), Mr. W. W. Pomroy wasdoing a prelimi-
nary round the course before starting in a race, and the
usual pedestrian—this time two of him—crossed the
track. To avoid running them down Mr. Pomroy ran off
the track, collided with a stump, and leaves a widow and
two young children. Pomroy practically threw his own
life away to avoid hurting these two people. And in this
he was wrong. Blitherers who get on the track should
be ridden down ; if that cannot be conveniently done,
they should be shot.

Things are looking up in the Pacific. The
British Lion—presumably#; after deep considera-
tion—has come to the conclusion that he can spare
just two joints of his long naval tail for the China
station. So the elderly battleships Triumph and
Svviftsure are shortly to amble out and grin tooth-
lessly across the narrow .sells at Nippon’s modern
floating forts. It is rather like putting two
wizened little grandfathers on outpost duty; but
it accords well enough with the present warlike
spirit of Bull’s Empire. The National Conference '
on Sea Training, convened by the Navy League,
which sat—-or reclined—recently in London with
the avowed object of preventing the gradual dis-
appearance of British seamen from British ships
adopted a motion urging that boys attending ele-
mentary schools be trained in seamanship ai d
navigation. The blessed conference said nothing
about kicking Ram Chunder out of the fo’castfe
or, in lieu thereof, adding a course in marine
slave-driving to tl|e curriculum of the green young
sea pups. It just passed the job and the responsi-
bility on to the unfortunate kid in a large, loose
fashion, arid gave three cheerp for Nelson.

Blood Burnt by Tobacco
Teeth, Eyes, Nerves and Brain
Destroyed by Smoking I
German physicians declare in that deaths
amongst Germans between eighteen and
thirty-five years of age, one half die from
nicotine or tobacco poison. They unani-
mously declare that “ Tobacco burns out
tbc blood, teeth, cues and brain.”
Other great doctors declare nicotine to
be the poison of both heart and brain,
producing paralysis, apoplexy and
HEART DISEASE. Dr. Drysdale says
' ‘Nicotine enters the body by the lungs ■,
ruin of the nerves is complete.”
Men and youths who are slaves to
tobacco, wrecked in nerves and health
through continuous smoking, should take
“ Smokure” Tablets. They contain the
vital, antidote for the poison, creating
nerve power, heart and brain strength.

a course of Mother Seigel’s Syrup*
will quickly set you right. It is

up and strengthens the stomach,
aids digestion, stimulates the action-
of the liver, gently regulates the
bowels, expels all impurities from
the system, purifies and enriches the
blood, and thus imparts health and
tone to every part ot
the body. Thou-
sands of men and
women are every
year cured of indigestion, biliousness,
constipation, and other stomach and
liver disorders by the aid of Mother
Seigel’s Syrup. Their testimony,
given witfiout fee or reward, affords
convincing proof that Mother Seigel’s
Syrup possesses curative and strength-
ening properties not found in any
other medicine. As a digestive tonic
and stomachic remedy, it has no
equal. Take it daily, after meals.

“C.K.Y.” : Have just had my second and final
div. as a creditor of the gone-bung Farmers and Settlers’
Co-operative co. As a shareholder I rake in nix. I was
induced to take shares on the financial repute (see S.M.H.
and D.T.) of William Mcßillion, chairman. lam satisfied
now about “ publicity ” being a sufficient safeguard. This
thing was reported solvent; three months later it ex-
ploded with a horrible perfume. Wrote to a director—
the M.L.A. for Waverley—to know what had been done
with my dollars. Reply : The matter is in the official
assignee’s hands. Waited to read the report of the
evidence of the Heaven-born financiers; but, for some
reason I should like explained, it was heard with closed
doors. And we are still waiting to hear where our money
went. Also we have strong doubts about Heaven-born
financiers.

The S. Aus. Supreme Court, after thinking hard
for over two years, has decided that niallee is not timber.
Chief Justice Higinbotham, of Victoria, said that a.l
trees, whether alive or dead, are timber; but S. Aus.
decided to accept the English definition: “Wood usid
for building for human habitation, not as a temporary
makeshift, but as suitable material in the place where ii
grew.”

“ Klifton ” : Messrs. Hooke, Spunge and Robbe
are rival drapers, carrying on business in three small
shops which adjoin. The relations existing among
these three commercial magnates are not happy, and
each loses no opportunity to outwit the other. The
other day, to his disgust, Spunge found Rooke’s windows
plastered with—“ Colossal Salvage Sale! Wonderful
Bargains !! ’’ And on Robbe’s windows—" Realisation of
Bankrupt Stock ! Must Be Disposed of. No Reasonable
Offer. Refused !!! ” Then Spunge had an inspiration,
and soon the tide of customers which had been flowing
into his rivals’shops turned into his own establishment.
For his place is in the middle, and over the top of his
door Spunge had erected a huge placard, which read:
“ Main Entrance."

“Rodd Rowan”: The members of the Mel-
bourne brick combine are supposed to be making money.
Quite a mistake ! The manager of one of the cos., who
is also a large shareholder, says so himself. “ There is
very little profit in brick-making,” he told one of his
foremen. “ No,” said the other, “ there can’t be much in
it at present. Four or five years ago, when we were in
the poor ol'ay on the surface, you were making a profit.
There was 12J per cent, of broken bricks then. Now
there is only 3 per cent, of losses that way. We are
turning out the same quantity of bricks now with 16
less men at work—l 6 men’s wages saved. And there has
been an increase of nearly 15 per cent, in the price (38s.
instead of 30s. per thousand). So, as you say, there
can’t be much profit.” , The manager thought hard,
grinned, and walked off. 1 There’s another thing besides.
Lots of builders accept the figures on the load-tickets or
cartnotes. One recent week the contractors decided to
check the numbers. One alleged 500 load was 180 bricks
short. None of the others was so bad, but the total
shortage for the'day was 500 bricks. If the contractors
hadn’t noticed they would have paid 19s. for bricks they
didn’t get. And if ISO bricks can evaporate off one dray-
load, think of the frightful loss there must be that way
in a whole brick-yard. I hope, after this, you won’t say
anything unkind about brick cos.

“Jape : There are no fine points about a
sausage. It is neither fish, fowl nor good red herring.
Swine, and the husks that the swine did eat, about fill
the bill, though Chicago specimens may also contain
Prodigal Son. And yet, on Saturday nights, for the un-
sung, unhonored sausage strong women have fought.
Bah! have we, I ask, no steak in the country? The
meanest rich womata I know buys sausages; she buys
half a pound from me, and half a pound from the Com-
monwealth Meat Emporium, and as seven problems go to
the pound, she makes one problem on the deal, for pro-
fessional etiquette forbids dissection. 1 mention this to
show that it isn’t all love of sausage that spurs the
sausage-buyer. It is sometimes love of getting a bargain
—one sausage to the good. The good? Ha, ha! I
make the sausages. And I hate that woman.
* * * *
“Jewel-Block”: I guess the 50,000-tons-capa-
city credited by cable to the projected Cunard leviathan
stands for load-displacement. But even that would mean
about 40,000 tons gross, as against the Mauretania’s 32,000
tons. The new colossus, accommodating nearly 4000
passengers, will be just over one-sixth of a mile long, by 31
yards in beam—a positively appalling mass to come hurt-
ling along at nearly half a mile a minute. By the way,
there’s a flutter left yet in the despised wind-jammer.
The recently-ScottiSh four-masted barque Strathgryfe
—now German in name and flag—has just footed it from
the Land’s End to Melbourne in 73 days, doing the 5600
miles from the Cape in the remarkable time of three
weeks. I suppose the heart has gone out of the “ Main-
sail haul ” business nowadays ; but, though the 62-day
run of the beautiful little Thermopylae has never been
equalled, trips of 70 odd days used to be not uncommon.
In the old Theophane we made 74 days of it, one voyage ;
and the skipper swore a mighty swear that, next trip,
he’d down that or die. Well, he did die, and his next
voyage was. presumably, on the Jasper Sea.

“ Melb ” : Don’t suppose that the main support
of the sumptuous Pekin Caf6, and more sumptuous Can*
ton Caf6, is Chinky. To be sure there is Shark Fin, at a
half-guinea, for the Chink millionaire ; but these places
would starve on Chinamen. The real backing is White
Trash, as with the laundries. A restaurateur, near the
Pekin Cafe, writes up “No Asiatics Served.” The Chinky
will say, “We don’t care about ’em either.” The Canton
Caf6 is a long way off Melb.’s Chinatown. It goes in to
undercut the Spaniards and Greeks. White cookery is
the staple. Collins-street and Flinders-lane roll up.
Apparently this is the only Chinaman in Melbourne with
a liquor license. L. L. Tack by name. We lose one L.L.
and gain another. When White men work for Chinese
gardeners or banana merchants they are declasse. Does
anything of the kind apply to swells who go to Chinks
for their tucker ?
THE WORLD AND THE FLESH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Rev. J. T. Huston, addressing the Food Reform
League, a vegetarian body, at Melbourne the other night,
said he had grave doubts about the story of Adam and
Eve and the apple. “X am convinced it was not an apple
Eve ate, but a mutton chop,” said the rev. gent.
Brother Huston recommends oatmeal and raw food as
conducive to saintliness.
Had Eve eaten only apples,
As we read in Bible tales,
All our taverns would be chapels,
And we’d have no need of gaols.
But she ate a chop, and quickly
Came the fall of man to pass.
Sin and trouble followed thickly.
It is writ: “ All flesh is crass.”
On a vegetable diet,
So the cabbage-eaters say,
E’en the Devil would be quiet,
And old Nero bend and pray ;
For the wicked inspiration
That our fellow sinner cops
Is not due to vegetation,
But to devilled bones and chops.
In your wheat there may be weevils,
Blight in ’taters, old and new ;
But the soul-destroying evils
That disport in Irish stew
By the mutton are created.
Sinful thoughts and actions rash
Are with meat associated —
Vide “ sausages and mash.”
So repent, and let them put yer
On an oatmeal diet now ;
For the Devil is a butcher,
And his leading fiend is Cow.
Brother H. no worldly wag is,
And he preaches with a will,
If it wasn’t for the haggis
Scotland would be Eden still!

BEALE HIGH-GRADE PIANOS
Some reasons why Fourteen Thousand
are in use in Australian Homes:
Not mere cheapness—there is nothing' cheap about them, and it has
not been our aim.
Every part, every detail, is of the highest quality, and the sKilled
labor is the highest paid in the world.
The wrest-pins are all turned and nicKeled, which is found in no
other piano.
The bass strings are hexagonal, costing about double the price o/
ordinary wire, also a unique characteristic of Beale Pianos.
Tbe Iron Frames are mathematically accurate, and the scale is
calculated to a greater degree of musical perfection than any other,
because the tuning-system allows of a higher strain than does any other.
No climate has any effect upon the tonal quality.
The choicest timbers are available to us, not procurable in £urope.
We use Californian Redwood, the ideal for resonance. From our own
Queensland forests we have superb pines up to 7 feet in diameter, free
from Knot or flaw.
W"e slice Australian mahoganies and walnuts of unexampled
beauty, for export to our competitors in other parts of the world, and
for our own use.
The Beale Piano factories are the largest and most complete in the British
Empire. We sell direcfl from factory to family, enabling citizens to obtain
high-grade pianos at reasonable prices. They are not the lowest in price
you can get flimsy and showy pianos cheaply from the sweat-shops of
London and Germany but they will give satisfaction to two generations.

Captain C. S. Cartwright, who pilots the
Commonwealth’s Endeavor in its efforts to put
salt on the tail of Australia’s missing fish supply,
has had his thrills. He was wrecked years back
on Tristan D’Acunha, the speck on the face of the
Atlantic which was once garrisoned by the
British to keep an eye on the back door when
Napoleon was on St. Helena. Just how the eye
was going to be kept on at the distance was never
explained. Anyhow, Nap. made no attempt to
escape by swimming in that direction. When
the garrison was withdrawn, a small community
decided to remain, and was remaining vigorously
when Cartwright scrambled ashore. He was so
enamored of the simple life that he stayed five
years, and married there. Then lack of “school-
ing” for a growing family drovp him out. He
also tells a yarn of a cargo of whisky that was
cast ashore on the island. But as the whisky has
all gone, that isn’t a story for thirsty weather.

Mr. Edison’s Phonograph supplies the
entire entertainment. It will sing, render
any kind of instrumental music, or talk.
It is a marvellous reproducer of every
kind of sound, and especially of the
sort of sounds which, combined, pro-
duce music.

“ Bromide ” on Queensland pubs :
What is “Stan” talking about? Can’t he tell the
difference between a Chow and a white man? He tells
us “ there are at least seven ‘white’ hotels in Cairns”
(B 22/12/TO). It’s two months since I was in Cairns, and
there were only two then. If there are seven now, some-
one must have been whispering in the ear of Mr. Beer-
pump. He tells us, too, that “Mackay is nearly all
‘white,’” and “Townsville is rapidly falling into line.”
I’ve only just left Mackay; Townsville six days ago.
What I saw in both places forces me to say that “ Stan "
is a liar. I took a run around the Townsville pubs, and
found one “white” house in Flinders-street, and three
on Ross Island. No, I wasn’t drunk—not drunk enough
to mistake a Chow cook for a good white man, anyhow.
I know Townsville beer will turn plain atmosphere into
blue snakes and green devils ; but even it won’t make a
Chow white. As to Mackay, my inquiries showed that it
owns 24 pubs, of which 14 employ the colored curse ; and
I reckon it’s up to the white workers of the district to be
ashamed of it, for, so far as most of the pubs are con-
cerned, the matter is entirely in their hands. •
Barrister Ryan, of the Bananaland Par-
liament, gave the case away the other evening
Mr. Ryan : I desire to support your ruling, Mr. Deputy
Speaker. I think the arguments which have been
adduced bv the other side of the House, particularly by
the Treasurer, also support your contention. That is my
opinion.
The Premier : That is your professional opinion.
Mr. Ryan : No, it is not my professional opinion ; it is
my honest opinion.
Whereat the House guffawed. Yet, under the
party system, the politician should be about the
last person in the world to throw mud at Costs,
Esq., for having one opinion for private consump-
tion and another for business purposes. There
isn’t one party man who believes in everything
his party says and does; yet it is his job to
barrpek apd vote for the lot. If he approves of
99 per cent, of the party’s policy and votes “No
on the 1 per cent., then he is in danger of throw-
ing out the party and bringing in one with which
he doesn’t agree once a month. The system
and the absence of elective Ministries simply force
men to have two opinions, and to frequently use
the professional one that isn’t honest.
“ The Crocodile ” : Kidston ought to feel
proud of the wages his prosperous State pays
railway men in the Far North. In such places as
Townsville, Cairns, etc., where the cost of lijing
is very high, married men are working for 7s. a
day. Some of these men are supporting numer-
ous children, and the wives who do the house-
keeping deserve the Victoria Cross. The Phidston
party will no doubt look confidently to these rail-
way men for support at the next general elections.
And the rotten end of the business is that the
crowd will get a good deal of it too.
Railways Minister Denham, in advocating
the building of the Western Transcontinental,
dwelt on the splendid revenue-producing capabili-
ties of Queensland’s railways. Yet Denham him-
self, only four years ago, pointed out that there
was then an accumulated deficit of millions on
these lines ; and only last year the State’s railways
failed to pay their interest bill by £130,000, which
sum was made good out of consolidated revenue.
If this happens in a good year, what will be the
size of the deficit that the taxpayer will have to
carry through a drought when the system is handi-
capped by an additional 1200 miles of qraCk
running through one of the driest belts in
Australia?
PRACTICAL PETER.
HIMPERIAL HOFFICER (fiercely): “ That’s no way to hold a rifle. Do you mean to say that
you don't know the proper way?"
PETE FROM PARATOO: “ That's all right, old cock. I’ve shot more blanky rabbits than ever
you saw."
“Boggo”: This is how the Phidston
Ministry fulfils its old-time promise to cut down
the expenses of goverhment. Throughout the
Publie Service practically all the higher-paid
officials have obtained increases this year, while
the Leader of the Opposition has been paid at the
rate of £524 per annum, and the Deputy-Leader
who officiated in his absence has received the
same Salary. Also the Queensland taxpayer has
enjoyed the privilege of paying the Speaker’s
wage twice over—Armstrong, who took Bell’s
place, being paid at the same rate as the Honor-
able Joey. Of course, this is all very nice and
kind and sympathetic— but where does the tax-
payer come in ? Well might Arthur Morgan
remark from the dais of the Council: lhe
demon of extravagance is abroad in the land ! ”
Lennon, Mulcahy, Nevitt, Crawford and
Foley, of the Opposition, jettisoned their anti-
borrowing principles when Phidston s borrow,
boom and burst policy was under consideration.
Their explanation was that they had favored the
proposed railway and couldn’t consistently kick
the proposals to finance it. Once upon a time
Lennon was a bsfnk director; and if somebody
had promised him to reduce an overdraft, he
presumably would not have objected if the cus-
tomer had dynamited the bank’s safe to get the
money. Or if Mr. Foley thinks that, at next
election, his opponent should be defeated, he will
presumably see no objection to somebody putting
a bullet through the gentleman to make dead
sure of it. In short, if Messrs. Lennon, Mul-
cahy and co. agree that something should be
done, they .want Queensland to believe that they
can’t consistently object to any suggested method
of doing it, no matter how rotten they may have
previously declared that method to be.
The Church “Upon the Bust.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Archbishop of Brisbane, speaking: at the presenta-
tion of a testimonial of £lOO to one of his clergy, said .
“ However, when a gentleman went ‘ on the bust, even
if he were a clergyman, £lOO did not last for ever ; and
he had therefore much pleasure in presenting alsoia silver
box for use in the sacred offices of his ministrations.
Courier, 6/ISI’IO.
OH ! Some are gay on guinea five, and some
are glad on ten,
But they be mostly humble folk and
common toiling men ;
And others need a twenty when they seek the
jolly bowl,
And fifty scarce suffices to put others on the ff 'oll;
And there be those whose eighty pound would
melt in just a week,
But all of these be journeymen carousers, so to
speak ;
But if you want to see a spree and view the jolly
dust,
Just keep your eye on parson men who venture
“on the bust.”
Yes, the Bishop you may trust
Be the raising of the dust,
For a hundred pound’s a trifle when the Parson’s
on the Bust!
You talk about your Foxes and your Sheridans
and such—
I own in their potations they could beat the very
Dutch;
The bullocky who boozes is a spectacle to view,
The sailor man’s a caution with his beery Liz and
Lou ;
But the Church that drops its halo for a moment
in the spree
Is a quainter exhibition to the likes of you and me>
For when the parson peeleth off his coat of cleric
rust
And getteth off his cassock in careering on the
bust,
Oh 1 The Bishop you may trust
That there’ll be a jolly dust
When the parson drops a hundred on a sacerdotal
bust.
Oh ! how the imps of Satan trick a godly man
and true;
They tear his reputation, like a rotten rag, in
two;
They lure him from his fasting to a carnal sort of
feast,
And do their lurid best to bring him level with
the beast;
And that is how it happens that the Parson when
astray
Is known among the Worldly as the Gayest of
the Gay;
The hosts Satanic drive him till he’s helpless, and
he Must
Be the Jolliest of the Jolly and the Primest “on
the Bust.”
Oh ! the Bishop you may trust
When the Tempter a gust,
Oh ! a Huiidred Pound’s a trifle to the Parson on
the Bust!
QUEENSLAND.
PHILANDER F.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, December 31, 1910.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
The question whether Premier Kidston is to
parade at that little matter in Westminster in
June, when George V. will put on his metal head-
gear, is waxing hot. Up till now Wullie has ap-
proached the question most warily. As a matter
of fact, he would like to go; but it has to be
remembered that the House is, after all,
mostly Philp, and that Macartney and others
have been getting unmanageable of late. So
With Wullie so long absent, things might
happen. In a word, Philp might happen.
As matters stand, it looks as if Kidston s deci-
sion will be a fair indication of the approaching
political weather. If he thinks that, bolstered up
by his loan railways, he can win the 1912 election,
then he will sit tight and take no risk ; but if the
idea gets into his head that the game is up, he
will very likely go to the United Gohendom, take
a title, and then flop gently into the Agent-
General’s shoes. These will he made vacant by the
stepping out of Robinson, who is waiting with
one ear turned to the door-bell and one eye glued
on the steamer time-tables.
Did I tell you that Dr. Eleanor Bourne, in order
to take charge of the collective school-kid of this
State, has given up holding the ether sponge
while her brother medicos do the carving ? Hence-
forth sore eyes, deaf ears, delicate chests, incipi-
ent curvatures, classroom ventilation, seating
accommodation, and the inculcation of the rudi-
ments of personal hygiene and the art of first-aid
will be her special care and particular job.
Popular opinion commends the Government for a
very wise choice in its first school doctor. Eleanor
Bourne carried off the first exhibition granted to a
Queensland girl at the Sydney Uni., and followed
it up by a brilliant student career. Since screw-
ing up her plate upon the brass-bound Terrace of
Brisbane, she has been much sought after as a
child doctor, having “a'way wid her” among
small folk. >
Two engagements are calling for congratula-
tions. One instalment goes to Miss Eleanor
Hardie, eldest daughter of one of Brisbane’s most
popular medicos, and Donald Cameron, son of the
canny Scot who for so long’ represented Brisbane
North in the State Parliament. The other lot
goes to Miss N. Cory, of Toowoomba, and Mr.
Archie Hogarth, an engineer who hails from
Cloncurrv, where the copper comes from. The
latter pair announced the mutual understanding
at the local races on Monday last, and immedi-
ately the air was strewn with blessings.
Two deaths recorded lately are those of Mr. Por-
ter, a solicitor of some 30 years’ practice in these
parts, and of Arthur Martin, for many years a
well-known auctioneer, who was “ passed in ’’ on
Friday. Both men were at one time as well
known as the town clock.
The baby immigrant that recently arrived in
Brisbane as a stowaway on the steamer Levuka
was the centre of an interesting gathering at St.
Colomb’s Church, Clayfield, on Sunday last, when
the names of Jessie Philippa were given her.
Miss Philippa has, since landing without ticket or
attendant, become the charge of Mr. and Mrs.
Cruise, of Clayfield, who will bring her up in the
clan. Her first name is that of her adopted ma,
and the second an adaptation of that of the good
stewardess on the Levuka who “ did for her ” on
the voyage north.
There’s some talk among the tea-cups of a wed-
din’ that went astray in the Far North. A youth-
ful bride with a trunk full of pretties blew into
this port last winter, and after thoroughly enjoy-
ing herself for a day or so, duly set sail for the
North, where the impatient groom was awaiting
her. Then the clock stopped, or the wireless got
out of gear, or something, for no one heard an-
other word of the parties until the lady was spied
on a southern-bound steamer. Now comes the
rumor of a bridegroom who, after an enthusiastic
send-off at the mining camp and a pre-nuptial
presentation, was forced to return brideless,
though not altogether profitless. He obtained a
clearer insight into the changeable ways of
women.
By the time this reaches you Toowoomba will
be recovering from its annual breakout on New
Year’s Eve. Picnic races, with a series of balls
thrown in, were arranged for the death-bed
revelries of 1910, and although last year the guests
had to be revived with ices and fans after each
dance, the present weather in the hills is not
nearly so Sheolistic. Half Brisbane departed to
assist in the tumult.
Max Maxwell is out recruiting, and has been
roping in quite a number of locals. Ronnie
Byram, a young man well possessed in the matter
of features, is giving up banking to take on grease
paint; while Miss Nellie Nicholson, Brisbane's
most Gibson-like girl, is also gaining a little
experience ere she goes south to besiege the stage-
door which carries the sign, “Comic opera.”
In addition to a plentiful supply of youth, a col-
lection of really beautiful top notes and a good
appearance, Miss Nicholson has a sizable bump of
intelligence which should secure her a thinking-
part in any show.
The flittings to the South still continue. Mrs.
William Collins and her bairns travel by the
Wyreema to Sydney en route for the Apple
Island ; and the Jas. Forsyths are off to the same
small, State in a week or so.
Yours affectionately,
MARIO.
The Bowman testimonial fund, which was
opened some months ago, closed on the last day
of 1910. A total of £970 was in the bag when a
count was made, and straggling subscriptions to
come in will probably enlarge the token to £lOOO,
which will give the sick Labor leader the long sea
voyage that his condition demands.
The Sapphiretown gem miners are feeling
good towards the Fisher Ministry. Some time
ago the local Progress Association wrote to Cus-
toms Tudor, asking for a duty on foreign-cut
sapphires, and upon doublets and bogus gems.
The Tariff Amending Act lifts doublets and Brum-
magem out of the free list, and puts them where
they will pay from 3G to 40 per cent., and the
question of a duty on cut Sapphires and zircons is to
be considered when the tariff is under general re-
vision.
Bananaland Assembly was overrun with
deputies last session. The illness of Speaker Bell
gave Chairman of Committees Armstrong the job
of Deputy-Speaker ; and Dave Bowman’s break-
down gave Lennon a busy time as Deputy-Leader
of the Labor party ; and Armstrong’s temporary
promotion to the Speakership led to Kidston’s
colleague (Grant) being made Deputy-Chairman.
Also, there was a Deputy-Premier. At any rate,
the policy which Kidston advocated was mainly
the policy which Kidston had denounced; whereas
it was the policy which Philp, of the gorgeous
deficits, has all along barracked for.
Three little years ago Premier Kidston
preached from a score of Queensland platforms
that Bananaland should go slow with the borrow-
ing business on account of the approach of the year
1914, when the State has to renew some 12 millions
of loans. To-day Premier Kidston is preaching
that the best way to prepare for the crisis is to
rush another £7,000,000 of borrowings on to the
market. Philp says that is just what he would do
if he were Premier, and nobody has any difficulty
in believing him. It is exactly the sort of finance
Philp was fed upon in Queensland’s drunken days,
when the fact that a man had borrowed £lOO,OOO
from the Q.N. Bank was reckoned the best of
reasons for lending him another £50,000. But if
Philp consulted the Q.N. Bank he might get a
hint that the scheme wasn’t a complete success so
far as either the borrowers or the lenders were
concerned. In fact, there are some people who
would go so far as to call it a rotten failure.


CONGO
NEVER-LEAfC
ROOFING
wamwßmm v/r/jzttmvi nnirmtiinuni iimzassm ssasito
QONGO ROOFING is made for all
weathers. An unusually severe storm
won t hurt it. An extraordinary hot spell
won t hurt it. An extra long cold snap
won t hurt it. It will stand any kind of
exposure. The weather finds no way in
which to attack Congo Roofing.
can’t damage it, because there is
nothing in it that is affected by water
in any way. If Congo Roofing were put
at the bottom of a pond, the water would
never disintegrate it.
A IR can t damage it because there is
nothing in it that is volatile —nothing
that will evaporate. If Congo Roofing
were hung out like a flag for years, so that
air could get at both sides of it, it would
stay just as pliable and elastic as when new.
(P LI MATE can’t change it because there
is nothing in it that is affected by either
heat or cold. The heat on roofs is often
terrific, and in cold weather the snow thaws
and freezes there for weeks, but Congo has
never shown any effects of such exposure.
[T can t rot because there is nothing in it
that can decompose. It is because we
know the nature of the materials we use that
we venture to say that Congo Roofing is
practically indestructible.
pEOPLE who buy Congo Roofing for a
building once don’t buy any more in
after years for that building —because it is
there to stay , although the roof costs but
little. 1 hey do buy more for their other
roofs. Everyone who tries Congo is soon
a convert, and he becomes more enthusi-
astic the longer he waits for the roof to
wear out.
Jh VERY foot of Congo Roofing is care-
fully inspected as it comes off the
machine. No imperfect rolls are allowed
to leave the factory. Every pound of the
material that enters into the composition is
carefully tested before being used, and
strictly held to standard. Should it fail in
the slightest way, it is immediately discarded.
Congo Roofing is handsome in appearance,
being of a uniform slate-grey color.
ROOFING is put up in rolls
36 inches wide. Each roll contains
216 square feet, sufficient to cover 200
square feet and allow for a 2-inch lap. The
rolls are finished with an attractive wrapper
and label, and are capped with a special
metal cap to protect the ends of the roofing.
A steel rod runs through the centre to hold
the caps and cement securely in place. .
gUFFICIENT Congo cement, nails
and tin caps for applying are neatly
packed in the centre of each roll, so that
you pay nothing for extras.
CONGO ROOFING is easy to apply.
Skilled labor is not necessary. You
don t have to hire an expert to help. If
you can drive a nail you can do all the
work that is necessary.
CONGO DAMP COURSE
Congo Damp Course is an effective armor against underground dampness
and vapors. It should be used under 1 basement and cellar floors and
cemented tight with Congo Cement. The lime in mortar will not injure
it, the earth gases will not hurt it, water is powerless against it, white ants
find that it contains certain antiseptics which they cannot attack, vermin
and rodents likewise leave it strictly alone. Congo Damp Course costs so
little and is so easily put in place that you cannot afford to build without it.

Do not take tonics for nervous breakdown. Thej' will
Spur vour already-exhausted nervous systepi to further
effort—but as they give no compensation for the further
consumption of nerve force, you must suffer a reaction
which will leave you in a worse condition than before.
There is only one way in which nervous breakdown can
be repaired, and that is by feeding the brain and nerve
centres with Lecithin in an active, organic form. Anti-
neurasthin does this, and actually builds up the nervous
system by administering to it its natural food.
If you suffer from brain fag, inability of concentration
of thought, want of application, dyspepsia, indigestion,
neuralgia, headaches, languor and irritability, send to
the wholesale distributor for Australia and New Zealand,
H. A. Goddard, Eagle Street, Brisbane, Q., enclosing

warded to you by return of post. [1

A Woman’s
Success
in life is limited according to the
state of her health. No woman can
put forth her best efforts if, for instance,
she is continually troubled with headaches,
biliousness, depression of spirits, etc., which
arise through allowing constipation to go on
unchecked. Many women make the mistake
of neglecting this condition, with disastrous
results in later life. And yet it is so easy to
correct. One or two doses of
CALIFORNIA
SYRUP of FIGS
“ Nature’s Pleasant Laxative ”
are all that is needed to stimulate the organs,
cleanse the system and restore the body to a
perfect state of health. Thousands of women
take California Syrup of Figs, for it is the one

THE CONDEMNED ROOKEKY.
’Twas a dilapidated rookery,
There was cobwebs on the wall,
The cracked ceiling indicated
’Twould collapse suddenly and fall ;
When condemned by the authorities
The old pensioner shed tears
For the crib had been his castle V
For over forty years ;
It had withstood the heat of summer’s
And the force of winter’s blast
And to the lonely veteran held
The memories of the past; y
In the grave yard lie his faithful wife
Who had been his guiding star,
They lived happily in the rookery
Till the poor soul crossed the bar.

“ Goanna ” : Before long there is going to
be a blithering and instructive contrast out Gren-
fell (N.S.W.) way, where that great philanthro-
pist (ride morning press), landra Greene, M.L.C.,
has so marvellously developed wheat-growing at
landra. Greenethorpe, as the railway station is
now called, is a choice specimen of a one-man-
owned wheat town, and the rows of tin houses
shimmering in the heat of the summer sun are
a torpid spectacle. They are all painted the
same ferocious color —brick red, all neatly built,
and all on the one monotonous design, the
same deadly plan. The spectacle doesn’t yell
very loudly about the profit of wheat-
growing from one standpoint; but this will
be happily' balanced by a palace Greene
is building for himself. Rumor puts its cost at
anything from £30,000 to £OO,OOO, so it will run to
more than a whole lot of the tin tenant-houses.
The house is being built of concrete, and is a
massive advertisement for share-farming—as far
as concerns Greene, the one man of the crowd who
doesn’t have to farm.
“Pick”: If the Murrumbidgee started
with a foundation of beer and trimmed up on rum,
it couldn’t follow a more staggering course.
Rising in the Kiandra (N.S.W.) country, its
waters first flow south-east and then south. By'
i Qoonia they are worming through the ranges
towards the east, until cannoned off northward
by the inflow of the Eumeralla and Bredbo.
Thence they sheer off hastily from the arid regions
of Yass-Ganberra, towards the north-west, until
the Y-shaped gap between Barren Jack and
Black Andrew pour them out into the west.
After that their general trend is south-west and
south, but at Jugiong they take a fantastic twist,
which enables the owner of the Redbank sheep-
walk to loop in 1600 acres with 220 panels of fenc-
ing, the river enclosing the rest. Nearly every
whaler met along the “ ’Bidgee ” has a kink m his
garret. This is brought on by constantly turning
around the bends in the river.
“Spring”: A still-lively N.S.W. Judge
on a country circuit once unexpectedly claimed a
night’s hospitality from an old pioneer who had
often begged him to drop in. The house was in
darkness when he drove up ; but a pipe gleam in
the verandah welcomed him in. Inside, the host
yelled for “ Jacky ” to bring in the lamp. An un-
canny head dived through a door and said there
was “No kerasin, boss.” “ Well, get the caudle,
yer black imp!” “No plurry candle, boss.
“Well get some blankv grease in a jam-.tin and
stick a piece of rag in it !” yelled the host and
was proceeding to describe to the visitor the thick-
ness of the average nigger’s skull when from the
darkness earcie the sepulchral announcement that
there was “no plurry grease.” “Then—damn
yer eyes—go down the paddock and make a
stringvbark torch, and let his Honor have his
supuer.” As the nig stole away to the place
where the candles ought to be, and selected a
stringy torch from a number of others, the ancient
pioneer was telling his Honor that the wicked
nigger must have eaten all the candles, and the
Judge professed to believe his statements.
Sydney, fair city of the South,
Set in Pacific Seas,
The ships glide through thy fine mouth,
Aided by a welcoming breeze,
Where Dunbar’s wreck lies bleak and cold
Around past the Sow and Pigs,
They slowly move with gentle ease
To where the Warships bale
In dirty gray, with various rigs,
Into the Farm Oove they squeeze,
While Manly’s lovely steamers rush
Up to the Circular Quay, *
And Mosman’s and North Sydney blush
For power and fuller speed to keep with these,
The City proud from here does brush
For miles around its leas,
While coves and bays marked out as such
Set up a roaring wheeze.

“The Old Soldier”: The two British
officers who were caught in the island of Borkum
trying to find out what the Germans were doing
in that quarter have got the trouble they seem to
have been looking for, and have been sentenced to
four years’ confinement in a fortress. This is a
punishment unknown to British law; so the
British daily paper lets its fancy go :
The prisoners are cheerful and are satisfied with the
result. They will probably be sent to the fortress of
Gatz [Glatz] in Silesia. They will be allowed all com-
forts, and the society of the Governor of the fortress and
the officers.
frlatz is an old place which has never seen a
esieger since the Seven Years War. It has
plenty of vaulted stone casements in its detached
bastions to accommodate prisoners, who pro-
bably include some officers of the German army
found guilty of serious breaches of discipline.
The prisoners will have sufficient food and clothes
and some books, and will be let out into the ditch
for exercise under the eye of a sentry quite often
enough to keep them in health. But they will
hardly get very much of the society of the officers
of the garrison. They will certainly see the field-
officer of the day regularly, and he will listen to
any complaints they have to make. They may
or may not be allowed to write letters; under
Ordinary circumstances, “detention in a for-
tress” in German is really solitary confinement,
the prisoner being shut off from the world. The
wonderful thing about the whole business is that
two really clever men could take so much trouble
with such a very small result. They could have gone
into many a shop in Hamburg or Bremen and
bought excellent German maps and charts that
would have told them all they wanted to know.
SEMPER EADEM.
PARSON: “ Well, Mr. Giles. How's your cold!" PARSON: “ And how is your wife? ”
GILES: “Oh, very obstinate, sir.” GILES: “Oh, about the same.”
They only made Tait of the Vic. Railways a
K. 8., after all. He should have been at least a
K.C.M.G. —a Knight Commander of the Mangled
and the Gored. But perhaps K.B. in his case
stood for Kristian Burial.
Sydney’s rockchopper—the man who belts
the holes for the sewer pipes through the sand-
stone that underlays the city—has once more
leaned on hiS job and demanded another shilling
a day. And probably he will get it. The work
is so health-breaking that, so far, every appeal for
concessions has been granted. The last award
dealing with the industry fixed the rate of wages
at 11s. 6d. a day of six hours. Now a demand for
12s. 6d. a day has been made to a contractor who
has a big job ip hand for the Water and Sewerage
Board, and the, choppers simply d—n the
award. The contractor is kicking like Henry,
sen.; but there are very few rockcboppers, and
they are as unanimous as if there were only one
rockchopper. So, looking at the position casually,
it would appear that if the extra shilling isn’t
paid, the extra sewer won’t be made. Which is
simplicity in its most simple form.
A Press Union has been formed in Mel-
bourne on a good basis. Editors Cunningham
(Argus) and Schuler (Age) have given it their
blessing. Cunningham, in fact, will address the
crowd."though he cannot join. Good Argus and
Age men are in it. The best feature of all is that
the few who have nothing to complain about are
throwing in to help the many who have. The
movement is to be Australian, with a special , eye
to the country. Another laudable thing is that
there is to be co-operation with compositors.
Fearful nonsense has been talked in the past about
a dividing line between writer and comp. The
most junior cadet at 20s. was supposed to be a cut
above the lino-operator, making his £5 or £6.
This was the English idea. Now the craft is
going to be Australian. So members of the union
in Melbourne go so far as to talk about printers
refusing to set non-union copy—in which case, of
course the journalist will have to stick to the
comp.’ The meanest Gradgrind going is a certain
type of country newspaper proprietor, and-he will
have to be attended to—in the interest-of the
decent ones as well as of the press workers. And,
after them, the union must have a slap at parsons
and pensioners, who come in with their stuff on
the cheap, and take bread out of the mouths of
poor journalists. The most offensive of all is the
Reverend Wowser. The job of keeping souls out
of Hell isn’t enough for him. He would run a'
hay and corn store only that Mrs. Grundy would
squeal. So he dabs away in a sneaking fashion at
what he calls journalism.
Sydney Morning Herald collects some
weird information at times. The latest (3/l/’ll)
was inclosed in a heavy-dumpling article dealing
with the list of New Year ‘‘honors Says
Gran’ma of the possibility of Prime Minister
Fisher being offered a title at Coronation time:—
The ultra-democrat can seldom resist a title even if it
is only a title made for export and placed m that
dilemma he is apt to play fast and loose with his political
fntp There are, of course, men whose hold on their
nartv is so great that they can dare to be a Knight
Commander. Sir Richard Seddon was a conspicuous
case in point. If anything, Sir Richard was even more
popular than plain “Dick.”
As a matter of fact, Richard Seddon steadfastly
refused to listen to any suggestion that he should
accept a title, although to that end oil was poured
over him repeatedly and pressure put upon him
continually. If the old democrat was ever Sir
Richard Seddon, it must have been since he passed
to the Golden Shore; and if the Herald has a
special representative in that part it has never
previously made as much use of the fact as it
might have done.
“N.” on the martinet methods of boss
Booth, of the “ Salvation ” Army :
Here’s the stupidest thing I have seen this week in
Melbourne, and that is saving' a great deal. Herbert
Booth, son of the Gen’ral, commanded in Australia for
five .years, and was about as good as any of the other
Panjandrums—Barker, Howard, Coombs, McKie and
Hay. Herbert built and opened two important estab-
lishments, the Training Home and Printing Office. I
heard him address the Harmy as “ Precious Comrades,”
and the Harmy Hallelooyered. His name was graven on
the memorial stones. Just now, under an imperative
ukase from headquarters—which I suppose means General
Booth —Herbert’s name has been chipped off those stones.
What a malignancy of Christian spirit! Still, it is re-
ciprocated by General Booth’s other son, Ballington, who
took legal steps in N’York to have the name of William
Booth removed from his little son. It recalls the Mel-
bourne parson who quarrelled with his patron after
whom he had named a little son who died. That parson
chopped the name off the tombstone.
After doing five years’ useful work, J. M.
Bell, the Canadian whom Seddon imported as
director of M.L. geological survey, hands in his
papers and hits the trail for his native snowfields.
On the journey, he calls in at Papua to examine
an alleged oil-bearing area for a Melbourne syndi-
cate. Bell is still only 33, but he has already
stacked up a tall reputation. He was only 22
when he led the Canadian Government’s expedi-
tion to Great Bear Lake; at 23 he was leader of
an important expedition for the Lake Superior
Power Co.; he was a Harvard Ph.D. at 26, and at
27 he secured the big appointment in the raeketty
islands, where the geologist has to drive his pick
in gently lest he should annoy a caged geyser or a
corked volcano. He takes with him his mining
geologist, Colin Fraser, a local product of the
Auckland University, who has been assisting
“ the boss” with considerable distinction.
A brother of Captain Creswell, director of
Australia’s baby navy, threatens' to be leader
of the very little Labor party in S’Africa’s new
Union Parliament.
The matter of erecting a tombstone over
the grave of the late “Johnny’’Sheridan in Waver-
ley Cemetery (N.S.W.) was discussed at a meet-
ing of the Melbourne Green Room Club last week.
Sheridan, thus far, has been a very neglected
identity since his death, it seems, and his grave is
a poverty-stricken allotment without a stone to
mark the fact that a famous theatrical character
was laid there. For the “Widow O’Brien” was
famous, and will be remembered in America,
Britain and Australia for a long time to come.
No other female impersonator was ever so con-
vincing, droll, instructive, or thoroughly clean in
his characterisation as the little Irish-Jewish
humorist who created his own joke in “Fun on
the Bristol.” The proposal to. spend a few pounds
on a tombstone is too modest. If the subscription
were extended to New York and London, a more
considerable sum might easily be raised.
Ernest Whitington, of the Adelaide
Register, tells this yarn : —He was with the S.
Aus. legislators on their recent Murray trip, and,
with only two bathrooms among 50 passengers on
board the steamer, was induced by Jackson,
Chairman of Committees, to hang on behind the
dingey that was being towed," and take his wet-
ting that way. The exercise, at 10 miles an hour,
was refreshing, but the pace took his pyjamas off.
They were recovered and thrown into the boat,
and "just, then the procession reached Renmark,
where the youth and beauty of the place were
standing on the wharf. ' Whitington dared not
climb out; in fact, he dared not do anything bub
drift. So, preferring death to dishonor, he drifted
down on to a steamer, got inside its paddle-box,
and took'a sporting risk of its revolving, while he
resumed the one garment that civilisation de-
mands as indispensable.
From “ Boswell ” :
“I move that the voice of the people be no longer
heard.” That appears to me the sum and substance of
the “arguments” adduced by Wade and co., in their
opposition to the McGowen Government’s Electoral Bill.
They clawed at the Bill here, and they scratched at it
there, and they moaned long and piteously because cer-
tain “Liberal” seats would be endangered were the
franchise granted to all the free people living therein. It
seems to them shocking that electorates hitherto re-
garded as pocket boroughs should be exposed to the fire
of the enemy. The previously unheard of provision
whereby nomadic workers may enter their protest
against Toryism once in three years doesn’t appeal to
Wade, Wood, or Waddell either. And yet, as all three have
reDeatedly announced that they are the only true friends
the working-man has. their fear of his vote is remark-
able. The roaring Wade and the yapping Wood them-
selves have such a burning desire to be heard, and are so
frantic when gagged, that their sinister attempts to gag
others had better be set down to a hallucination that
they constitute the whole State, and that nobody else
matters.
The Tory press fusses considerably over
the fact that Rear-Admiral Bridges has spoken
bitterly of the Federal progressive land tax, and
has declared that it will “warn off the would-be
settler.” This Bridges is a Tory, aged 67. He left
the navy and became a big landlord in Victoria
23 years ago, and proceeded to warn off the
would-be settler ; and he has made much money
here, and has sat long hours in the Melbourne
Club casting a disparaging eye on the country
which has treated him a great deal too well.
Bridges, in fact, is not a bluff British tar these
days, nor is he an outsider taking an unbiassed
view of Australian legislation. He is just an
infuriated old local landlord, who hates the idea
of having to make a little bit of room for other
members of the human race, _ and if he didn t
object to the Federal land tax it would be a very
poor sort of tax.
“ 0.K.” supplements a send-off :
A par. in a recent Bulletin informed me that W. H.
Williams, oldest of Melbourne printers and about the
voungest-looking man for his age that ever talked
familiarly about the Roaring ’so’s in Victoria, was lately
numbered with the fallen. Rest his soul ! I knew him
well of yore, and edited one of his weekly publications
what time it was in the hands of trustees, W.H.W. being
a printer who knew his business, but preferred to be
unbusinesslike in his methods. At that time and ever
afterwards I wasted breath in exhorting him to write up
his reminiscences—commercial, musical, literary and
theatrical. He never could be persuaded to undertake
the task, or to believe that he had—what he really
did have—a light and ready journalistic hand
for it. Williams, in his young days, was a colleague
of G. V. Brooke— i.e., he warbled between the acts of
Brooke's show at the theatre in Queen-street, Melbourne.
He had raised his tenor voice in public ere the veteran
R. S. Sinythe came to Melbourne as a youthful journalist,
and could talk more interestingly of old musical identities
and their art, in all its bearings, than any other man I ever
met. But what I chiefly remember him by was his scorn-
ful criticism of newspaper vaporings re the dangers
arising from the burial of the dead in the vicinity of the
living. W. H. Williamscame of very tough stock, and he
told me that his aged parents had lived for about half a
century in a house at Chester (Eng.), located at the foot
of a hill crowned with an ancient cemetery. The house
had a large cellar, and into this cellar the gravy
from the crowded cemetery had been draining for
all those 50 years that the old folks lived, hale and
hearty, in the premises above.
“H.H.”: For a pointlessness which
amounts to the incurable ward in the lunatic
asylum, and a heaviness compared with which an
elephant ranks as a balloon, I recommend the
following anecdote, dug out of a Sydney snips
weekly:—
The following interesting incident took place one day
towards the end of last month on the public road at Bal-
moral.
While the King, accompanied by one or two members
of the royal household, was returning to the castle on
foot from a deer-stalking expedition, the party met two
small boys, between five and six years of age, with their
schoolbags on their backs returning home from school.
His Majesty' stopped the lads, who respectfully raised
their baps, and in his well-known kindly manner in-
quired whether they were on their way home from school,
to which they replied in the affirmative.
The King next asked if they could read, and being
eagerly assured that they could do so, they were asked in
turn to read a small portion, which they did, selecting a
passage which they had learned thoroughly at school, and
knew almost by heart. His Majesty highly commended
the lads on their accomplishments, remarking that he
doubted if his own boys could have given as good a read-
ing at their age.
The King then asked the hour they had to be at school
in the morning, and received the reply, “ Nine o’clock,
sir.” The next question was, “ When do you get home f ”
to which one of the boys replied, with amazement written
on his face, “We’re gaun hameth’noo.” His Majesty
patted both lads on the head, and departed, smiling at
the lad’s reply.
Observe the blighted imbecility attributed to the
monarch. Any ordinary person meeting two
small schoolboys just after school hours would
assume that they were going home from school.
His Majesty made dead sure by inquiring. And
then he asked what time they came home from
school instead of recklessly assuming that a small
boy who is found going home from school at, say,
4 p.mi, probably goes home from school at 4 p.m.
Observe, too, the royal sense of humor ; the fact
that the small boys were going home filled him
with mirth. . And consider his conscientiousness ;
he patted them both on the head. It was lucky
there weren’t 19 of them, else the job would have
looked wooden and mechanical. Even as it was,
the spectacle of one boy being patted while the
other one waited to be patted, and then the one
who had been patted standing at attention while
his mate was put through the process couldn’t
have been inspiriting.
A small curse to the extent of £2,107,000
came home to roost in Victoria on New Year’s
Day, and the accommodation provided for the
fowl was just what might have been expected.
The Weary Government cordially invited the old
creditors to accept another IOU; but the total
amount thus renewed was only £538,352, or little
more than one-fourth of the lot. The balance has
to be provided for somehow. As a stoppage
Weary has got £500,000 from the Savings
Bank, and a London bank will give thg State a
temporary overdraft for the rest ; but Ihis only
means pushing the trouble a few weeks into the
future. Weary and Watt have therefore two
struggles ahead of them —one to extract from a
new Cohen enough to pay the bill that the old
Cohen wouldn’t renew, and the other to extract
the £2,000,000 which the Government says it
is going to play up in railways, etc. For the
former, the Government proposes to offer a
foreign Cohen its IOU; for the latter, it pro-
poses that the State shall offer itself its own
lOU.

EXPERT OPINIONS
MR. W. O. LAMB, who was one o! the Agricultural Pioneers of the
Darling Downs, where he has been farming for 48 years, says:—“The average
quality is exceptionally good. . . . The soil is specially adapted for producing
large crops of lucerne and potatoes. . . • I can conscientiously recommend this
country, &c.”
MR. DAVID McCULLOCH of “ Roseneath,” Parkes,
N.S. W a prominent agriculturist, who will harvest 4,000 acres of wheat this
season, says“ Kidges and flats alike will compare favourably with the richest lands
of Victoria and N.S.W., and the potentialities for dairying and lamb raising are
practically unlimited. 1 ’
MR. PHIL. McGRATH, Snr„ who has been 44 years lucerne farming
in Laidley, says :— '* I consider the Boonara Flats are exactly similar lucerne soil
, , The ridges are exceptionally good soil.”
MR. H. RAFF , Surveyor, with 30 years experience of
Queensland, says:—“l have subdivided many large estates in Southern, Western,
and Northern Queensland . Boonara leads them all. Its physical features
combine to make it the finest farming and dairying proposition I have ever seen.”

Eczema
fo run on
uncliccKed
Eczema, the most common of ail Skin Diseases, is easily
amenable to treatment, and should never be allowed to run
„ * on unchecked. If intelligently treated in the beginning*
Eczema can be readily kept at bay, but if allowed to run on indefinitely it
will grow worse year by year until finally it becomes a trial exceptionally
hard to bear.
M^ c . zema ,J las a s t ron g tendency to become chronic, and the dreadful
sufferings that so many endure from the irritation and itching has caused
many a sufferer days of irritability and nights of sleeplessness.
Undue exposure of the Skin to excessive heat or undue irritation
caused by dust or gritty matter are the principal causes of Eczema, and if
allowed to run on unchecked this disease often causes blindness, deafness
and loss of hair.
Rexona, the new rapid healing Ointment, is particularly designed to
remove Eczema and other kindred skin affections, and is an unsurpassed
preparation for this purpose. Rexona promptly allays the irritation and
itching, taking away the desire to scratch the parts affected, quickly dries
u.P an y Pos or exuding matter, eases the ache and pain, and, being a germi=
cide of the highest order, promptly destroys all dangerous germs and
bacteria, building up at the same time new skin tissues and cells, so that in
the end a new and perfect skin is formed where the disease formerly existed.
In the following letter Mr. John James
Rogers, cr. George Street and William
Street, Norwood, Adelaide, S.A., tells
how he suffered frightfully with Eczema
for 15 years, and how he was finally
cured by the use of Rexona. This is a
striking example of how Rexona cures
Skin Diseases, and if you are troubled
with eczema, now is the time you should use
Rexona, for the disease can be readily checked
and much suffering and trouble avoided.
Mr. Rogers writes as follows:
Rexona is a tried and proved specific for
Eczema, Running Sores, Bad Legs, Piles,
Chilblains, Varicose Veins, Chapped Hands,
Sore Feet, Scabs on Head, Pimples, Black-
heads, Ringworms, Erysipelas and all skin dis-
eases. Rexona is so universally successful
that we want everyone to write and get a free
pot, for we feel sure that the sample will con-
vince you that there is a cure for you in
Rexona, the Rapid Healer.
Rexona is sold everywhere in
triangular pots at 1/6, and in
large pots at 3/-, holding
nearly four times the quan-
tity ; or will be sent post free
upon receipt of the price by
the Laxo-Tonic Pill Co., 15
O’Connell St., Sydney, N.S. W.
“ I have suffered from eczema for the last 15 years,
and tried different remedies until I was thoroughly
sick of trying them. About a year ago I had asevere
attack of eczema on my hands. On that occasion I
lost two finger nails, and one thumb nail. Nine
months ago I had another severe attack in the ankles
and legs. I used to scratch them until the blood was
running. Then I had to get up in the middle of the
nigliD and let the tap run on them until they would
be numb with the cold and the flesh raw and blue.
Then to work next day with pick and shovel. This
was fighting a battle under difficulties for bread,
and to keep a roof over my head. I was later
suffering from another attack of eczema on the hands,
the fingers swelled and had big cracks in them, one
from the first to the third joint. About this time I
was recommended to try Rexona, and found the
cooling and soothing effect was something beyond
my expectation. I got a large pot and used it, and
it has perfectly cured me. I feel confident that anj'-
one suffering from eczema, no matter of how long
standing, will be cured if they will only give Rexona
a trial.”

Her Lost Love: A Romance of
Waddy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rnHERESA MEED was the embodiment
of Long Suffering. Waddy accepted her
as such. She was all the township com-
prehended of romance, too. And Theresa “ kep’
store” on Old Road, which was the acknowledged
chief thoroughfare of Waddy till the new pine
school and the tin post-office added so much to
the pretensions of Hoskins’s Way. Later, as the
result of a phenomenal burst of public enterprise,
and in the *hope of booming real estate and add-
ing to the attractiveness of Waddy as a health
resort for “ asthmatics,” a kerosene lamp was put
up opposite the P. 0., and Hoskins’s Way became
Regent-street.
After that Old Road slunk into the background.
The stock of kerosene gave out in a month, and
the public lamp never flickered again, but the
boys continued to gather about the post, and the
men to hold their nightly conversazione along
the lower rail of Flude’s fence, where the light of
other nights had fallen. Even the goats that
had once scratched themselves on projections and
angles of Old Road, followed the popular trend,
and now scraped their spare ribs against the
palings and door-posts of Regent-street.
This did not affect Theresa Meed. Nothing
affected Miss Meed. She was a thin, dark, hand-
some woman of 45, with an ivory-white face that
showed neither line nor stain, a vivid arch of
black brows, and two cold, ebon eyes. She wore
nothing but black, and that was neat and flawless.
Even the dust respected Miss Meed. Her wealth
of dark hair, parted to the level of her eyes and
carried into a heavy roll behind her ears, added
to her impressive appearance. She was easily the
most imposing thing in Waddy.
It was generally agreed that Theresa Meed’s
wrongs made her sacred, and her great wrong was
common property. There was not a child over
six in the township and district who could not tell
Miss Meed’s lamentable story. Every newcomer
had to hear that affecting narrative.
„ Twenty-three years ago Don Lovell came to
Waddy. He was only a stoker at the Long Shot
mine ; but he was young and good-loOking, and
when off duty he wore a better suit than Tracker,
the manager. Don was too partial to billiards, he
smoked cigars, and his whisky bias was quite pro-
nounced ; so Waddy credited him with a good old
English family and better days. He soon dis-
covered Theresa Meed, then a girl of 22, whose
curious attractions were rather over the heads of
philandering natives.
Even at that early age Miss Meed “ kep’ store,”
as her mother had done up to within six months
previously. Now, Theresa was an orphan, and
alone in the world. Like her mother, she made
no friends. She was very reserved, but Don
Lovell didn’t seem to notice it. He went often
to the store, and he chatted gaily and banteringly
at Theresa, precisely as if she had been an ordi-
nary, light-hearted human animal.
Eventually he beat down her restraint and con-
quered her reticence. They were seen sauntering
together on Cemetery Hill in the evenings, and
on Sundays they walked to the Springs and ate
fruit in Capel’s garden.
Lovell worked a wonderful change in Theresa
Meed. She became suffused with a hectic happi-
ness. It was like a fever that burnt red in her
cheeks, and glowed in her splendid eyes. Don
alone seemed regardless of this great transforma-
tion. He was careless and easy always; all
things rested lightly on his shoulders.
Waddy quite made up its mind that they would
marry, and one evening, when Lovell had been
about seven months in the township, Cameron
asked him, airily : “When’s it to be, Don ?”
“When’s which to be what?”
“When do you and the grocery consolidate?”
Lovell arose, yawning. “We don’t,” he said.
“I’m not of a marrying stock.”
“Why, man, she’s half daft about you. I
thought you’d just swoop at the chance.”
“I brought nothing to Waddy. I intend
taking nothing away.”
Cameron was amazed. “ Don’t vou count on
having easy diggin’ with that girl,” he said
“She’ll make a runnin’ fight of it.”
“I’m not such a fool as to stay and debate the
matter at length, Cameron. On a nice night for
walking I’ll pick up my heels and get over the
hill.
Lovell did not give anyone a chance to spoil his
programme. On the following night he went
quietly “ over the hill.” There were reasons for
an unostentatious departure quite apart from
Iheresa. Don had taken “the bankrupt’s track.”
He owed everybody money, more especially
Hamm the publican, and Franki of the Waddv
Temperance Boarding House. These two made
an effort to locate their missing friend but the
search was fruitless. Don Lovell had left not
even a footprint, and after two days it was
accepted its definite that lie would not materialise
again in the vicinity of Waddy.
On the evening of the second day, Theresa
Meed appeared at Tracker’s gate while the mana-
ger was working in his garden. She was even
paler than usual, and spoke with marked effort.
“Mr. Tracker, I want to know about Mr.
Lovell,” she said. “ Has anything happened ? ”
“He’s gone off, my girl,” replied Tracker,
bluntly.
Theresa’s two white hands gripped the pal-
ings. “ But only for a little while ? ” she said.
The manager shook his head. “ The fellow’s a
bit of a scamp, I’m thinkin’, Miss. He’ll not
show his nose in Waddy again.”
For fully a minute Theresa Meed stood there,
voiceless, clinging to Tracker’s gate. When she
spoke again, her tone was quiet and assured.
“You are mistaken, Mr. Tracker,” she said.
“ He will be seen here again.”
That was always Theresa’s answer if anyone
spoke to her of Lovell. Her confidence struck
the people as pitiful, and Theresa became a
heroine of romance.
There was a little garden before the side en-
trance of Miss Meed’s, home. The gate of this
Theresa opened wide, fastening it back to the
fence with a chain and padlock. She also opened
the side door, and secured it so with a cleat nailed
along the floor. For over 20 years neither gate
nor door was ever closed.
This action was quite in consonance with public
sentiment. Waddy gave it a romantic interpre-
tation. The open door was a pathetic appeal to
the recreant lover, a touching assurance that,
come what might, in her heart there was for him
an imperishable welcome.
Theresa went quietly about her duties, a strik-
ing figure, gentle but tragical. Her faith never
faltered and her words never changed. A sort of
pitiful reverence enveloped her. She was the un-
complaining victim, the Faithful Soul, a living Re-
proach, a marble monument reminding all of the
perfidy of man. Every Sunday night, wet or
fine, still or stormy, she walked to the summit of
Cemetery Hill, and stood by the hump-backed
gum that sprawled its gnarled limbs along the
ground, where she had sat with Don in those
brief hours of happiness.
The people of Waddy said that Theresa Meed
always looked past them--beyond them. Her
eyes were always seeking her Lost Love. Their
interest was not wholly artistic. It was paternal
and benevolent. Waddy stood about the Forsaken
One, an unwinking guard.
When Spicer set up his Universal Supply Store
in Regent-street he sold one pound of anti-friction
and three candles in three weeks. Then he struck
his flag and put up the shutters. When Tanner
got into the habit of hanging about Theresa’s
store, three citizens of W addy took him aside and
expostulated with him. He was advised to desist.
He ignored the admonition, and was nearly suffo-
cated in the slurry from the Long Shot puddlers.
Theresa had another suitor, “Curly” Oates.
For a year or so “Curly ” was content with mute
adoration. Then one day he spoke to her follow-
ing her in the street.
“Say, Treser, won’t yeh marry us?” pleaded
Oates.
Theresa Meed was like a pale statue, cold, deaf,
blind.
“ Oh, go on, yeh might’s well. I’ll make yeh a
good ’usban’, ’selp me I will,” persisted Curly.
“ I bin sober a year.”
Theresa walked on, her eyes fixed straight
ahead, her face rigid.
“I’m that fond ov yeh, Treser, I can’t eat,”
pleaded the tremulous suitor. “I got a stiddy
job. I’ll do anythin’ if ye’ll on’y have us.”
He followed her to her own door, appealing
piteously ; but she never turned, she gave no sign
of hearing, no hint that she was aware of her
suitor’s existence.
That action did “Curly” a lot of harm. It
was as if he had tried to break an idol or besmirch
some cherished tradition. He was severely repri-
manded. He met expostulations at every turn.
Eventually, he fled the township like a badgered
malefactor.
Later, a little girl told a strange story about
creeping unheard into Theresa’s house, and watch-
ing the heroine before a mirror, making her face
white with mysterious chemicals, reddening her
lips with rouge, and darkening and pencilling the
curious arch of black brows. No one believed her
tale. It only earned-the little girl a whipping,
and. was regarded as a quaint outbreak of original
sin.
Then came the irresistible railroad, harshly
materialistic, blundering over sacred things.
Theresa’s store must go. The hill on which it
stood was to be cut through. Miss Meed resisted
stonily, but pathos was vain against the machinery
of progress. The store was lifted on a j inker,
and shifted into Regent-street. Theresa was
compensated, and iron utilitarianism prepared
to sweep away the little garden, and the small
emblems beloved of a stricken soul.
Miss Meed could not content herself after the
change. She neglected her business, and drifted
uneasily about the township. She was often seen
standing in her dismantled garden on the Old
Road. Waddy understood, and was full of sym-
pathy. It even cried out against the railroad that
was to bring Prosperity along by main strength.
Never had Waddy been so stirred as on the morn-
ing of the discovery of Theresa Meed’s disappear-
ance. She had gone in the night. There was
little stock left in the store, her rooms were as
usual, but Theresa was nowhere to be seen.
Public opinion was strongly in favor of suicide.
The old shafts were searched ; the deep holes
along the creek were dragged ; and Tracker—an
old man now—went carefully over the Long
Shot dam with a garden rake. Returns were nib
The efforts of the police to trace Theresa by
description were not more successful. No pallid,
black-haired, statuesque woman had been seen
any where. Waddy abandoned the idea of suicide,
and said that Theresa had gone out into the wide
world seeking her lost love.
Five months later the cutting through Bald
Hill was nearly completed, and had encroached on
Theresa’s garden. It was on a Monday, at noon.
The navvies had put a big blast into the reef be-
fore going to crib, and suddenly and mysteriously
Waddy became conscious that something was
wrong. The people poured from the houses.
Instinctively they ran to the cutting.
The blast had torn out tons of yellow reef,
leaving a clean face above, and about two feet
below the subsoil a niche was disclosed in which
reposed a human skeleton. The bones were
intact. Standing out from the ribs at the back
was the buckhorn handle of a large knife, the
long blade of which, now a mere wisp of rust,
passed through to the breast-bone.
Plainly, Don Lovell had called upon Theresa
and made known his intentions, for the remains
of a small parcel containing identifiable articles
lay with his bones.
The coroner’s theory was that Theresa Meed
had known all along the whereabouts of her lost
love. He lay in the grave she had dug for him
under her bed, with the long bacon knife she
wielded so cleverly fast in his heart. The jury
returned a verdict in accordance, with that idea.

r Zam-Buk Comforts
and Heals Soothes
Swelling and Aching—and Strengthens and Stimulates the Feet.
ZAM-BUK has proved a splendid cure for foot troubles. When the
feet ache or smart, and feel hot, tired and swollen, wash them in
warm water, and then rub the soles, ankles and insteps freely
with Zam-Buk. As Zam-Buk’s potent, healing juices sink through
the skin, they soothe the tissues, strengthen the tendons, and bring
real “foot comfort.” Chafed and blistered parts are strengthened or
healed, and hard growths are softened. Zam-Buk comforts and heals
hot, swollen, sweating feet, galled spots, and takes away the pam of
corns and bunions. There is nothing so good for the feet as Zam-Buk,
the ideal soother and perfect healer.
Sore Heels and Tender Feet.
“Being an insurance traveller,” says Mr. W.
Sims, of 139 Tynte St., North Adelaide, “ I am a
lot on my feet, and very often sutler from sore
heels and tender feet. Upon the application of
vour Zam-Buk Healing Balm the soothing effect
'is wonderful, and in a short time my heels are
quite sound again. I always have Zam-Buk in
the house for the use of my wife and children in
case of burns, scalds, etc., and have great
pleasure in recommending it to fellow-sufferers.”
Burning Feet and Sore Insteps.
Mrs. Gunson, of 157 Hoddle St., West Rich-
mond, Melbourne, writes: “I am a canvasser,
and am, therefore, constantly on my feet. My
insteps became very tender and broke out in
sores. I applied different lotions procured from
the chemist, but they utterly failed to give me
relief. Seeing Zam-Buk advertised, I procured a
pot. Before I had used half of it, the sores were
all healed, and the burning-, irritating feeling had
left my feet.”
EVERYBODY’S EVER-READY SOOTHER AND HEALER,
Keep a pot of Zam-Buk handy for sunburn, rashes, insect bites, prickly heat, heat
swellings, cuts, burns, bruises, chafings; sore legs, backs, ankles or feet; pimples, erup-
tions, etc. Of all chemists, or post free from the Zam-Buk Co., 39 Pitt Street, Sydney, for
Is. 6d., or 3s. 6d. large pot (3s. 6d. size holds nearly four times the Is. 6d.).

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SAND and strips of made road, and, in
the infrequent forest belts, a blustrous wind
all day amid the tall trees. The Stanley
Road Board will kill a few yet.
White sand, yellow clay, black peat, and water
like strong cold tea. Pink and red heaths and a
soil too poor for blackberries, though the pest
throws its spiky wires over the roadsides where
the land is fat.' Then the button-grass, and
heaths and the bells of the Blandfordia growing
sheltered under dwarfed gums; squdgy, boggy
plains for a dozen miles; then crooked eucalypti
and the three-petalled iris starring the ground,
showing the true fleur-de-lis of Florence, and
giving these sunny glades the semblance of a
Tuscan lawn. Flowering desert; black pools in
the sand; more spewy button-grass, gushing to
the hoof-beat —a vegetable spring mattress, on
pressure squirting water through every hole in the
wires, and the liquid covered by a beauty of pink
and white and lilac—every inch a flower.
At last, the sea; high ground and sudden little
valleys, yellow sea sand drifted in tongues over
the white sand of the land. The sea sand, very
fine of grain, wind-combed into fantastic shapes
as mother combs little Willie’s front curls. Out-
crops of limestone, succeeded by barren quartz-
ites, lichen-spotted.and pockmarked with fungus;
small patches of English grass ; little invasions
of clover; and then the house at the Arthur River
where lives the ferryman—beg pardon, the cap-
tain of the punt.
At the ferry the river is very deep, and above
it is navigable for 20 miles. It is 150yds. wide,
and its entrance is incurably rockbound, sand-
bound and timber-bound. The flowers and ti-tree
and stunted gums—as of Sandringham—grow
here to the sea ; and there is added to them the
buzzy—a vegetable porcupine which sticks to the
traveller so that he may carry it further on and
distribute the seed where it isn’t wanted.
Once over the river, and there is the tine gallop-
ing ground of the beach, level as a billiard-
table, resilient as rubber. The redbills and sea
snipe and gulls and mollyhawks start from the
horse’s feet. Great fantastic sea-growths and
drowned kelp, torn from the sea depths and cast
ashore, stripe the sand. The bull-kelp smells
pleasantly, when it is new; but when old,
it is cast high on the beach and fly-blown, and
sea birds feast on the rottenness and the filthy
insect life and the taint of iodine. Above the
fantastic sand-drifts is the short sweet grass sought
by the coast cattle ; flowers grow under the bushes
of the little white currant which is the food of the
bronzewing pigeon ; the horses revel in the joy of
movement —the green seas steeplechasing over the
brown serrated rocks which wrecked the barque
Rebecca and her immigrants 50 years ago; the
white quietness of the drifted sand ; and beyond
the breakers the depths, moaning to a lashing wind,
that fresh gale which seems to blow for ever from
Cape Horn. Whalebaek rocks taking the steeple-
chasing seas in sullenness; sierras cutting the
leaping water with a scream, and in these rocks
the nests of the Cape pigeon. There are quick-
sands on these open sea-beaches at the mouth of
every creek and river, but safety for horse and
man where the fresh water meets the salt. In
the freak of a ribbon of kelp lying in a beach pool
and blown into sinuous movement by the gale,
you may see a possible origin of the probable
myth of the sea serpent. Echelons of the sea
besiege the fresh water of the river ; all is war
here, sand, wind, sea, bird, fly, maggot, redbill,
gull and sea pigeon. Ducks from Australia come
here by the'thousand in midsummer to feed on
the corruption of the beach and the rotting bull-
kelp ; arriving to the day, because it is a fashion-
able crush for ducks. We might read, if we
could, in the Daily Quack some such Society note
as this:
Lord and Lady Mallard, the Hon. Miss Duck and
Captain Teal have gone to the West Coast for the maggot
season.
The red-billed oyster-catcher dresses like a waiter
—white shirt and tail coat, all complete—and
walks flat-footed, as if calling for the last plate of
meat at midnight. The waiter’s wife meantime
tries to attract us from her ndst, flying over the
little sandlark, who totters at great speed on his
apparently unreliable legs.
As" we galloped, a dog with a temperament
which never learns by experience, and who had,
therefore, to trail his neckchain as a drag, gal-
loped ahead ; but the journey was not enough,
for he had a mind. To employ that mind on the
15-mile run he carried heavy sticks and roots in
his mouth, planting his luggage as he tired of it
under a bush, that he might play with it again on
the return journey. And the sun by some miracle
came out, and the gallop was good, and the
gale blew enough to make one enjoy the struggle
with it.
But there are times, on these wide beaches, when
travelling is no pleasure. At high tides, with a
bad sea and heavy west weather, the great logs
that strew the beaches go afloat, and when a sea
breaks, horse and rider are hidden in foam—safe if
the horse stands still, but often the frightened
animal plunges, gets in amongst the floating logs
and is carried to sea. Many cattle were so lost on
this stock route to Zeehan. The noise bewilders
them ; they become dizzy from long looking at
the retreating wave and try to follow it. The
rider, if lie be nervous, has his eyes on a fixed
object—tree or rock or some other immutable
thing—and keeps his head that way. At river
entrances, like that of the Pieman, there are very
big quicksands to avoid, and the drover sends his
cattle into the salt water; and then comes the
danger of the sea. Suds from the tortured foain
in the guts of the rocks pile up 15ft. or 16ft. high,
and smother the living thing that goes into it. At
some big rivers a lane of floating pine stakes, held
by wires, keeps the cattle from ringing; and the
passage is assisted by drovers in boats, and by the
dogs that jump on the backs of the swimming
beasts, and nip them to mad effort. And after
the rivers and the beach there is the button-grass
peat for the summer road, sand for the winter;
and an energetic man driving half a dozen wild
“ fats ” through the mud and the stinging sleet and
the black water to Balfour, to sell then at sd. or
6d. a pound. , . , ,
Whale Head is a little toy of a harbor, a boy-
size haven, but a very welcome side-track in this
mad coast. The sun, after being invisible for
nearly all dav, came out to set like a Masonic
lodge certificate. There were broad sun rays, like
those used by German lithographers, and broken
by a black cloud with a white circle and a red
speck looking out from the rays like an eye; and
to complete the chromo, a gull flying to the sun
set as understudy for Noah’s dove, but going to
slav fish and crying raucously as he flew.
The gale got its second wind at nightfall and
blew all our whiskers off; and we sat close to a
big fire on that bitter summer night, and shivered
in the genial zephyr whenever we moved. This
polar-bear weather is valueless at all times and
ridiculous in December. The ideal weather for
the world is an early spring morning in Hell.

The Book.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BEFORE me gleams a Volume, rare,
And radiant to behold ;
With picture-poems painted, fair,
In lines of green and gold.
That Great Raphael, who moulds the flow’r
And stains the sunset skies
Its author is. No critic dour
His workmanship decries.
Homeric is his theme, and this
No halting rhythm mars—
What bard-song ever soared like His
Whose harp-strings reach the stars?
With Art sublime the Great Book glows ;
And magic minstrelsies;
And Music from its pages flows,
In chords that never cease.
On each fresh page this endless tome
Some new desire doth hold ;
Its readers may for ever roam
By wonder-ways untold.
Aye, he who cares, may turn at will
Rare treasure-leaves, to learn
Of cool cloud shadows o’er the hill
Or sunlight on the fern.
Slow may he follow —all his soul
A-thrill with long delight—
The changing Seasons, as they roll
The path of Day and Night.
His eye may wander in the Spring
O’er dewy lands, a-sheen ;
Where fairy martins sweeping wing
Across the paddocks green ;
Or scarlet lories, in their flight
Among the wattles, fold
Their turquoise wings ; to drop like bright,
Red rubies cast on gold.
Oh ! he may gloat the hillsides clear,
That em’rald with the vine ;
The waving wlieatfields just in ear,
The silken-coated kine.
When from her green the briar breaks,
A sweet rose-sister shy,
Or proud, the lordly gymea shakes
His crimson banners high.
A serial of the seasons, he
Who loves the Book may read—
The tale of summer, joyous see
Imprinted on the mead ;
In yellow heads of ripened wheat,
In purple clusters, hung ;
In orchards, breathing forth the sweet
Of ripened fruit downflung.
Beneath the ti-tree down the creeks
Is writ a chapter cool,
Wherein the tongue of Nature speaks
From shaded reach and pool.
Brown Autumn, like a dairy lass
With rain-wet cheeks of health,
A rosy gleaner, too, will pass,
Her apron full of wealth.
Their sloughed, curled bark, the silver trees,
From shining trunks unswathe,
Like nymphs by singing, summer seas
Disrobing ere they bathe.
Now lines the dasyure lean his lair ;
Now moults the wild black swan ;
The shifting snipe are otherwhere;
The covey quail are gone.
New wine and must, and yellow gourd ;
Fat sacks of spilling grain,
In rick and loft and cellar stored,
Bespeak the garnered gain.
So Winter steals, with soft warm rains,
To soak the canefields all;
And Southern snow, that deep remains
Along the ranges tall.
So Winter, in her fur-lined gown
And hood and muff of grey,
Goes tripping o’er the farmlands brown,
Frost-jewelled, on her way.
So, from this Book the Bards-to-Be,
The Painters yet unborn,
Their songs will glean in ecstasy :
Their pictures clothe with Morn.
The Shades of those, in Austral rhyme,
Who wrote, as pioneers,
Will surely hail that full, sublime,
Rich culture of the years.
When I have turned the Puzzle Key,
That opes the Low Black Door ;
And from this human entity
Go forth, to sing no more,
On some Australian hill, that greens
With bourgeonage of grass;
Where down the Morning’s cool demesnes
The glowing day-winds pass;
Low lay me down. Nor wet in grief
The Old Earth-Book with tears;
Remembering that line and leaf
Were mine through many years.

MEN WILL FEEL YOUNG
for just as long as their digestive organs continue strong and
active. When the stomach grows weak, the liver sluggish,
the bowels constipated and the kidneys insufficiently active,
age creeps on apace. There is truth in the saying that a man
i§ as old as he feels, and the woman is as old as she looks.
Some men at sixty are almost boyish in the exuberance of
their vitality. Others at forty show all the signs of being
“played out”—appear, in fact, prematurely old. Men of all
ages should remember that
AS LONG AS THEY TAKE
Beecham s Pills they can either preserve a good digestion or
restore an indifferent one. In both cases they will discover
that this is the surest way to feel young again. And perfect
digestion means so much ! It is a process that involves the
harmonious working of important organs. Properly per-
formed, long life, verility, good spirits and nervous energy
attend it. Without it, the most splendid physique drifts
towards deterioration. How'excellent, then, is it to know that
the right .way, as well as the easiest way, of preserving these
vital functions is to take

FROOTOIDS
( ,Cure Headache, Indigestion, Constipa-
tion, and Biliousness. They are elegant
in appearance and pleasant to take;
they are immensely more valuable than
an ordinary aperient; they remove from
the blood, tissues, and internal organs,
waste poisonous matter that is clogging
them and choking the channels that lead
to and from them. Frootoids are
THE BEST
aperient medicine to take when any
Congestion or Blood Poison is present,
or when Congestion of the Brain or
Apoplexy is present or threatening. They
have been tested, and have been proved
to afford quick relief in such cases when
other aperients have not done any good
at all. Frootoids are absolutely un-
rivalled for
FAMILY
use ; their beneficial effects are evident
by the disappearance of headache—a
bright cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are a very economical
MEDICINE.
A dose taken once a week, at bed-time,
is highly beneficial. They act splendidly
on the Liver. A constipated habit of
body will be completely cured if the
patient will on each occasion, when
suffering, take a dose of Frootoids in-
stead of an ordinary aperient. The
sufferer thus gradually becomes quite
independent of Aperient Medicines.
