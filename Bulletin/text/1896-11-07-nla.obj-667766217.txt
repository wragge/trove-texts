THE RED PAGE.
To wit : Life is a mine in t.he universe of Death.
The lamp of Love hangs in the mine. Angels
nutter round the lamp and make the walls of the
mine dance. Sometimes the lamp is hid when
you want it, and the other fellow hugs your girl.
Then when you lie dead and think of these
things you feel grieved.—Of course, this is an
obviously unfair summary, and the most poetical
idea in the world can be murdered just so. But
the parody has enough of truth to force home the
idea that ephcott’s whole image is awkward and
lumbering, and does not throw one gleam of
poetical light on the familiar theme that Love is
Heaven and the absence of Love is Hell. Too
many of Jepheott’s poems are built this way
You read them once anti bring away no impres
sion from a fog of rough, confused, invertec
language. You read them twice: the fog o:
language lifts a little, and the meaning glimmers
through. You read them thrice, and the meaning
turns out to be a tame old meaning which coulc
be expressed with twice the force in half the space
And often Jephcott seems wilfully obscure. How
many poets persist in mistaking obscurity fo
illumination, and how many readers praise .them
for the error !
• * • •
Jephcott reverses the ordinary electrical condi
tions; it is from a sky of clear words that his
thought lightens. Not terribly, bub often finely
As here—
Love! now that we love eaoh other
And know God’s fatherhood ti ue,
And that Man is our blood-bound hr )ther,
We will alter the world, we two !
(This in Ereles Adams’ vein.) And here—
This is the joy of being a man:
To woo whom you please, and win whom you can ;
While woman still her desire must disguis i
And never look Love in his absolute eyes,
But intangibly weave, and famish, and wait;
The idiot chanee her imperial Fate.
And here—
There’s only one sun in heaven,
Only one earth is ours,
Only one life is given
Us and the birds and flowers J
There’s only one sky to cover
Earth and the whole great sea-*
And give me, O God, one lover,
She but one kiss to me.
Almost J. persuadeth us to be monogamists. Bub
only one kiss ! Catullus knew better.
* * * *
Jephcott writes of “ White Paper”—
Smooth white paper ’neath the pen ;
Richest field that iron ploughs.
“ I caress,” he says,
I caress its surface sheer,
Holding it the Absolute,
Where the things to be inhere,
Waiting their material bruit.
And, like the earth’s song, like the sap’s song—
Evermore a tiny song
Sings the pen unto it, while
Thought’s elixir flows along,
Diviner than the holy Nile.
How our fathers, poring over this white paper in
the dark, traced our secure path on it by starlight
or stake-fires!
O white list of champions,
Spirit born, and schooled for fight,
Mailed in armour of the sun’s,
Who shall win our utmost right!
Think of paper careless sold,
Which few pence had made too dear
On its blank to have enrolled
Beatrice, Lucifer, or Lear!
Think of paper Milton took,
Written, in his hands to feel,
Musing of what things a look
Down its pages would reveal.
O the glorious Heaven wrought
By the Cadmeau souls of yore
From pure element of thought I
And thy leaves they are its door 1
Light they open and we stand
Past the sovereignty of Fate,
Glad amongst them calm and grand,
The Creators and Create!
The virginal Paper has had no more eloquent
aulogium. But there is still room for an epitha-
lamium—When Pen Weds Paper. ’Tis a pretty
theme, and fruitful in imagery. Conceive the
bridegroom Pen, now bold, now hesitant; the
coy and fluttering bride; the march of merry
Ideas strewing roses, roses, all the way; the
jubilate of the populace; the acclaim of future
ages ! Could not Herrick have done it featlv ’
* * * * J
This is firtely expressed of a rail way-journey—
Dangers ’neath their dim red veils
Crouch by the rails.
’Tli.fi “red veils” and the “crouch” are of the
ess' nee of Jephcott’s promise. Other lines—
I breast long heights that hopeless rise
Under huge saies.
Others—
Thro’ the swimming plains of sleep
Swiftly I sweep
O’er the swimming plains of sleep
Slowly I creep.
Hours, hours starry-eyed
Over me glide,
With their swift wide wings at rest,
Set to the West.
It seems unreasonable, in the face of these, to
denounce .Jephcott for want of melody; but his
voice is rarely tuned so Many times more often
he is excruciatingly harsh, careless of his sounds
and accents (“ Shine, gems no steel-stroke loosen-
eth.” Ugh !), bedecking rough lines with words
strained from their sense, obsolete or obsolescent,
and seemingly quite proud of fantastic peacockery,
and quite ignorant that every time he makes the
reader hurry over a cacophony, or pause to disen-
tangle a meaning, he loses impetus, loses force,
loses poetic value. Then lines like these come to
make amends :
O Life, Death makes thee strange and holy,
Even as Love makes thee great and pure ;
With arms round each man stands secure:
We cannot fail and corrupt wholly
While Love and Death endure.
One is not sure if this isn’t the finest thought in
all Jephcott—the alliance of Love and Death to
ennoble existence. How much grander than the
G. F. Watts idea—the vulgar idea—that Death is
Love’s foe !
* • * *
The poetry of the following and final extract is
not obvious at a first reading. (Most of Jephcott’s
verses want reading twice: some, as said, have
little to give in return for three times.) And you
must figure to yourself the scene in the solitary
bush, and the solitary man in the solitary bush-
all his conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils, shrunk
to this little measure—and the solace of a fire to a
solitary man in the solitary bush (you, for ex-
ample). Then the flavour comes and lingers.
Prettily phrased enough, hut with no particular
strength or import; and how many thousand years old is
the idea? To be sure, most id,as are old—all the best
ones, anyway—hut they should be, and can be, so re-
faeed and presented as to give familiar nerves a tingle of
novelty, and so make a more abiding impression. That
abiding impression is the stamp of value in verse. No-
thing is good which you can read one moment and for-
get the next—li e this of Nora Hopper’s in the Ludgate'
There is absolutely nothing to this but a little rhyming*
and a little phrasing—and Nora Hopper’s name. It has
n?™!' ff° r T, 14 \ ou '> ' Tlakes 110 picture, impresses no
thought. But Nora Hopper has prosed and versified
several Celtic legends with some degree of skill and taste
—though some of her results have been uncommonly
tedious—and has been authoritatively recognised as in-
spired with the true spirit of Ossian and Co., and now she
can write what dull and obscure thing she pleases, and
people cry up her dulness for wisdom and her obscurity
for depth of fancy. It is often so in England. But as an
example of an old idea re-faced and made effective—it is
very old, printed by “Ouida” in “Under Two Flags”
u ahur > dr £? others—take a verse or two from Sept.
N.W Review. The New Review, of course, is a magazine
ot a higher stamp, and prints verse which has energy as
well as art, and which is not continually occupied in
sentimentalising over worn old sex-phases for the benefit
of soft-headed readers. And its verse has the atmos-
phere of art to which we in this half-educated country
can only rarely attain—though even in the New Review,
or m the best Eng. literary weeklies, there rarely appears
anything so poetical as Daley’s work, or with so much
rugged force as Lawson’s.
In the Hospital.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sun creeps slowly up the wall ;
The Judas-flow’rs show bright an 1 r. d ;
The scent of pine-trees gaunt and tall
Comes to me as I lie in bed.
And through my open window sound
The parrots’ cry, the cattle’s lowing,
The insect life that strews the ground—
I hear the very grasses growing.
A fleeting swirl of pigeons white
Gleams by me as I fie and gazy
Arid onward, onward to the right,
And westward through the golden haze.
I stretch my hands to them in vain ;
The hopeless tears my eyes are blinding ;
All, God 1 will I return again
To where the sleepy stream is winding?
Out westward where the yellow grass
Lms hot and struggling with the sand ;
Where Drought has stopped, and will not pass,
His hot arms clasped about the land
’Tis there the lowing cattle call,
’Lis there the heated wind is sighing;
Tis there the curlews’ sad notes fall—
Will I return ? . , or am I dying?
Before me on a great bare pine
The parrots rest and harshly scream.
Dying ! . . Despairing thoughts are mine :
No longer can I lie and dream.
The sky is dark ; the Judas-tree
A blood-red blur is slowly growing :
What holds the future, God, for me?—
The parrots scream, “There is no knowing.”
ROBERT ALLAN.
Sydney Jephcott.
“Women and music should never be dated,”
writes gallant Goldsmith in “She Stoops to Con-
quer. Surely his gallantry knocked all solid
value out of the epigram. Music is in a sense
immortal a goddess ever fair and ever young •
and the auld sangs, to which there are no sangs
comparable, have their youth renewed like the
seagull’s with every new generation which sings
them. But women ! —they date themselves; or
.Nature dates them, defying Goldsmith. And
even the wrinkles on the brow of a musical score
are to be counted by a scientific musician. Yet,
so long as it expresses natural emotions, music
should never lie dated. Nor poetry either, with
the same reservation. Homer’s morality is out of
datH, out we fight his battles with ardour, for the
tendency of the natural man is still to fight.
1 ne 27th idyll of Theocritus is still delightful, for
maidsandswainseven nowadaysmakelovejustso—
out of sight of Mrs. Grundy. And, if you look,
it is only the euphuisms, and the preciosities’
and the moralities, the artful and Artless glosses
of poetry, which put it out of date. Wherever a
spring of true lyric feeling has bubbled up in
literature the ground is stid green about it,
though the heart - fountain may have stopped
jetting ten thousand years ago.
* * * *
, mi* 16 l ext sermon comes in the no-date of
lhe becrets of the South: Australian Poems,
by Sydney Jephcott,” issued some half-dozen
years back to an unappreciative public, and still
posted at 3s. 9d. from this office. One wonders
precisely how long Jephcott’s Muse has been
silent (for her utterances since she spoke in
volume-form can be counted on the fingers).
And, so far, she is a Muse of considerably
more promise than performance. “ The Secrets
<>f the South ” are told all in a youthful ferment, a
yeasty whirl of colored verbiage, and when you
sort out the colors and lop off the verbiage there
really isn’t much secret left. As a rule Jephcott
dreams, not thinks; and his dreams, occasionally
pretty things enough, are too lacking in strength
and substance to leave a deep impression. And,
as well as strengthening, he wants clarifying and
harmonising ; and age often brings harmony and
clarity and strength ; —which is where the import-
ance of his date comes in. As we know him at
present he is vague, very vague; rarelv able to
clutch and press home his thought ; often hiding
an ordinary thought in a touzle of fantastic
epithets—which aggravates an earnest reader; and
geneiaUy doing his best to show that Francis
Adams’ praise of him was exaggerated —as it
was, undoubtedly.
* * * *
This is a sample of the typical Jephcott
LOST.
Lost in Life’s deep-mazed mine, that never
Doth open to a Heaven clear,
We wade above the floods of fear,
Towards the lamp of Love forever
Seeming' to shine so near, so near.
Who heeds these endless excavations,
Hard-won by our laborious breath,
Hewed in the Universe of death ;
Arched in whose adamant the constellations
Shine, gems no steel-stroke looseneth.
But at the central splendor stricken
Still by the missile blaze of Love,
O angels throng Death's sphere above ;
The dense walls 'neath their far dance quicken,
And all with cosmal buoyance move.
But O to find but lampless mazes !
To madden at dark horrors nigh,
To sink against the walls, and lie
With dead face whereon rearing gazes
The light hid at our coming by 1
OUTCAST.
A small fire in its deepest midward burning,
Its dull light trembling up among the trees
That rustle in the icy gushing breeze.
Grey grass around, pervasive darkness urning
The light, beside whose centre sleeps half-shown
Amongst the grey grass, in grey blanket wound,
A pariah shape, while babbles dully round
The streamlet’s modulated monotone.
To sleep to-night among these shivering trees,
In fullness of ail time and travail born,
The man has waded through life’s agonies :
And now alike of hope and use forlorn, ’
Finds but one faithful in his miseries,
This fire—which will be ashes ere the morn.
Alone ! In all the Universe alone 1
In friends, if friends such have, all memories
Have closed o’er his absence like the seas,
Or air his form displaced in years bygone :
0 fire, be fervent in your services,
As Love, Light, Hope, and Angel unto one 1

English Magazine Verse.
0. B. Fry,,writing on “Cricket in ’96” in the New
Review, says “in comparing colonial and English cricket
it must be remembered that we have an enormous advan-
tage in possessing, not only a large leisur.d class, who
can devote all their time and attention to cricket but
also a number of men who make the Fame their
business in life. In Australia there is practically
no leisured class, and apparently there is no professional
cricket.” There must be the same reservation in a com-
parison of Australian and English periodical verse The
number of leisured, cultured" people is much less here
than in England, and maybe rhe proportion is less also.
So that, with a field of possible writers so much larger to
cull from, English magazine verse ought to be of
higher average standard than Australian. In respect of
form, it doubtless is—on the whole. Culture implies
knowledge how to perfect form, and leisure the time to
perfect it. But in respect of poetical message, inspira-
tion and energy, our few verse-writers often seem to get
better results than their rivals on the same plane in Eng-
land. Perhaps this is due, as regards the lower-class
English magazines, to the subordination of everything to
sales. Doubtless Pearson’s Magazine, which gives Kipling
a shilling a word for a story, could afford to buy the best
verse in the market if its readers wanted it. Considera-
tion of the verse which it prints goes to show that its
readers do not want the best verse in the market, but
merely simple little rhymes of sentiment, not too clever
and not too recondite—a kind of sweetmeat for a dull
palate. Thus the difference in quality of Australian and
English verse seems partly referable to a difference of
taste in English and Australian readers—and vanity with
a basis of reason derived from survey of over-the-sea
magas., insists that the general Australian taste is higher
more literary, more truly and intensely poetical. Four
of the more popular English magazines are Pearson’s
the Idler., the English Illustrated, and Ludgate The
character of Pearson’s verse has been hinted.' Sept’
Idler prints only one set of versus—which are neat
rhymes and nothing more. The Englisii Illustrated has
three pieces, which strike a little deeper note, but are in
essence stale and conventional. Here is the shortest :
LOVE AND GRIEF.
Grief raised a tear-stained face to mine—
l-iove, with a smile, looked up ;
I drove Grief harshly from my path,
And drained Love’s sparkling cup.
Languid with sweet satiety
I lay when day was done—
Then lo 1 Love raised her mask, and I
Knew Love and Grief were one 1
M. HEDDERWICK BROWNE.
THE KING OF FAERY.
I am the King of Faery :
A thousand years ago
Mv elfin mother bore me
Betwixt the snow and snow—
My elfin mother bore me,
Lightly as elfins may,
To rule a doubtful country
Between the night and day.
X am the King of Faery,
And wise I am and old,
And of my fairy wisdom
A thousand hands take hold.
But those that seek my helping
Are glad—for all their care :
My thousand years of wisdom
Lie dark upon my hair.
I am the King of Faery
And none there is so gay
Amid my gentle people
That dance the dews away.
I am the King of Faery
And none there is so sad,
Though Una is my lady
And Aodh my serving-lad.
NORA HOPPER.
THE SON.
O why is your hate of me so deep.
F;i t her ?
I grieve so that I may not sleep
For thinking how to turn your heart;
And up in cruel wonder start.
Although this body’s strong to bear,
Father !
I droop and falter round your chair ;
Stand like a woman at your knees,
In deep anxiety to please.
Why is the look refused me quite,
Father!
That on my brother dwells like light ?
At evening when the room is dim
Your shining eyes roam after him.
When I come near your lip is set.
Father!
With something you ean ne’er forget.
What’s vile in him, you think it strong;
What s good in me, you make it wrong.
When you were near to death, you said.
Father !
“ See that he comes not near my bed ! >r
I stood on the dark stair alone,
And swayed about to hear you moan.
Will something ever ’tween us stand,
Father?
Too deep for me to understand ?
Even in the womb you hated me,
When I was dumb and might not see.
0 since I can no way abate,
Father !
Your steady and enduring hate ;
Then strike me dead ! When you shall see
My blood so bright, you’ll pity me.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne's Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently Ihe diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ni 'nts. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the hack and chest without
success.
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tam worth, N.S. W.”
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne's Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed

MEN
Suffering from NERVOUSNESS and DEBILITY and

Remedies, which strike at the root of the disease. The
symptoms gradually disappear, nervousness and timidity
vanish, vigor and lost health return, sunken eyes retain
their old lustre. The blood-giving principle of the medi-
cine secures a healthy appearance, the patient finds
himself gaining in weight and flesh- hollow and sunken
cheeks become rounded , the weak and debilitated consti-
tution is restored, and the former sufferer finds himself
permanently cured with all the animation and vigor of
life.
ALL CONSULTATIONS FREE.
Persons residing at a distance can, by describing their
troubles in detail, be treated at home. The course of

Dr. GrIBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS Sc SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
man y years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely :—Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fuliness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fearof something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, fee.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt of 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,
A COMPLETE MEDICAL WORK,
fully describing how all private, nervous, and
skin diseases may be quickly and permanently
CURED, without loss of time and money. This
book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
ONE POUND is Sufficient to Send
for Remedies necessary for the Cure of
DBBILIT Y,
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DO NOT DELAY,
your case requires advice, and you can either call
and consult the Doctor personally, or, if you
reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
DR. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6d. in
stamps, and Dr. G-ibbons will send you, post
free, the Latest Edition of his Celebrated Work,
in which you will find a list of carefully-prepared
questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.

THE ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS, of
Sept. 28, 1895,' says :
“If I were asked which single medicine I should
prefer to take abroad with me, as likely to be
most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I should say O’ .hodvne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.”
APRIL
17,
’96.
...That is the date of a letter from
F. Williams, Proprietor Dunedin News-
paper Agency, High Street. His Liver
became torpid and inactive, and, like
so many others, he took
WARNER’S
SAFE
CURE
He says:
“ I suffered from general debility, pains
across my back and loins, and indigestion,
which made me weak, languid, and unfit for
business. I began using Warner’s Safe Cure.
The first two bottles seemed to make me feel
worse, but I knew by others’ experience that
this was not unusual when the liver is very
torpid, so I continued. Six bottles restored
me to my former good health, and I can
recommend it with confidence.”
Not a miracle, but Just another cure
brought about by Warner’s Safe Cure.
Do you take it?

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A VIGIL.
M.L.
One bird upon the roof,
A chorister forlorn,
Sings to the cloistered morn,
Hid in her cloudy woof,
A song that doth unfold
Itself in plaited gold.
Sing what I ne’;r can say—
The wave may love the shore,
The flowers the dews that pour;
The tired winds love to stay
On cliffs where moss has lain,
Spent with the toiling main.
Dearer to me one heart
Where I would love to dwell,
Woven with magic spell
Into its inner part—
Sunk in its secrecy
Like a star in the sea.
HUBERT CHURCH.
IN A GARDEN.
My garden well remembers
That happy, happy night
When Love’s fast dying embers
Were farm’d again to light.
White roses from the trellis
Droop’d gracefully and low.
O, roses, ye were jealous
Of Mabel’s breasts of snow !
The mellow moonlight lingers
On face and scented hair,
Touching with subtle fingers
Her neck and bosom bare.
My arms again enfold her;
The face of my desire
Leans close against my shoulder
And glows with passion’s fire.
And all my deep resentment
And all my bosom’s pain
Depart, and sweet contentment
Comes to my heart again.
L.D.
THE SONG OF GRACIA.
“And she was called Gracia because she was fairest
among women. And many men sought her, but she loved
one only.”—The Legend of Hezlud.
Spring.
Across the street, across the grass,
Across my life I watch her pass.
No pure star on a dusky height
Hath eyes more bright,
No lily on her bed
A statelier head,
No dewdrop on the beaded thorn
More radiantly doth glow apart !
O, she doth shine all these to scorn !
Fair are they all, flower, star, and dew :
She is the green bud breaking thro’
The winter of my heart.
Two violets, seeking Paradise,
Have hid themselves within her eyes.
Her lips are roses. She doth wear
A sunbeam woven in her hair.
And of the foam-flake of the sea
Her cheek and neck and bosom be.
And like a reed the low wind sways
Her slender figure glides along,
Serenely tall and fairy sweet
In this, the springtide of her days.
And O, to make my life a song
And lay it at her feet.
Summer.
And now the world recedes. Time, Space, are
fleeting.
All things but thee, O Love, have ceased to be.
Here where thy heart against my heart is beating,
And like a charm thy white arms compass me ;
And on thy blue-veined breasts my head is lying,
And all about my face is blown thy hair.
Here let love speak his full heart in sweet sighing,
For speech were powerless now to voice his
prayer.
Softly thy breath, like scent of violets blowing,
Steals o’er my cheek with slow, delicious pain.
Drink whilst thou canst the goblet crowned and
flowing,
For hours like these will never come again.
Autumn.
There is no bud of Spring about this forest,
And in our hearts, too, are the autumn leaves.
Where are the wings, O Love, on which thou
soarest ?
Meeter art thou to toil and bind the sheaves.
But there is mellower light upon our faces,
Thro’ all our veins the steadier currents flow ;
The statelier charms remain and friendly graces,
Tho’ dull and fitful wanes love’s lava-glow.
Winter.
The slow' bell tolls across the square.
She doth not hear its rise and swell.
The frosts of age have silvered there
The clusters of her sun-gold hair.
She sleepeth well.
Strange city echoes here are sent
Of reckless strife for prize and place,
Of hearts with warring passions rent,
But Death’s ineffable content
Is on her face—
A touch, a joy, a something there
That for my sake hath never shone ;
Too w'ell I deem in my despair
Her fairest dream I may not share.
And she is gone
Beyond this earthly azimuth
To those fair stars which poets sing,
Where blooms the tree of fadeless Truth
In gardens of Immortal Youth,
Eternal spring.

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1896.
The Queensland Deadlock.
According to latest advices, the deadlock on
the Queensland Federation Bill shows no
signs of improvement, and for the several
hundredth time the question of Australian
unity is hung up indefinitely. The trouble
in the present case is partly the natural
result of the treachery practised by the
Nelson Ministry, and partly the natural
consequence of an unworkable political
system. According to the original under-
standing, each province was to send to a Con-
vention ten delegates elected by the people,
and these delegates, provided they could
arrive at an agreement, were to draft the
Federal Constitution. If they did not
arrive at an agreement, which was at least
possible, there would probably be no Federal
Constitution, at least not till the whole
movement was started afresh from the
beginning. If they did agree but the
result of their labors was afterwards re-
jected by the popular vote of the provinces
there would also be no Federal Constitution.
Considering all the discordant elements in-
volved, it has all along been obvious that
when the Convention meets the Federal
movement will start on a troubled voyage
amid many possibilities of shipwreck. But,
so far, after two years’ labor and confusion,
the movement has not even got to the place
where its perplexities were expected to
really commence. The difficulty of getting
the six sets of delegates and the six Govern-
ments and the six communities to agree on a
form of union was recognised all along, but a
further trouble which was not fully appre-
ciated was the immense difficulty of getting
any Convention at all so that it could meet
together and start disagreeing. The fact
that a gathering of sixty men, repre-
senting six different kinds of provincial
jealousies, six different provinces, each
fully convinced that the other five wanted
to over-reach it and each desirous of over-
reaching the other five, any number of
separate private ambitions, animosities, and
axes to grind, and other conflicting elements,
would find it hard to arrive at any satisfactory
settlement was obvious from the beginning.
The problem of getting the sixty men to
meet was a matter for which no sufficient
allowance was made.
* * * *
The beginning of the Queensland deadlock
was the resolve of the Nelson Government
to entrust the election of the delegates to the
Assembly instead of to the people, as
originally proposed. The Government had
just finished laboriously “ faking ” a general
election, and had come back to power with
its majority practically unchanged. But the
election was won by a stupendous dead lift.
The majority cost even more corruption, hard
lying, judicious disfranchisement of demo-
cratic voters, and “management” in general
than any previous one; it was acquired
with such difficulty that another similar
struggle, in order to secure the re-
turn of ten incurable Tories to the
Convention, was not to be lightly entered
into. The Government-party was resting
from its labors, and the prospect of having
to set to work again and laboriously “ fake ”
the Convention elections was not agreeable.
The proposal that the Tory majority in the
Assembly should simply elect ten delegates
of its own pattern, and leave the people
entirely out of consideration, offered a beau-
tifully simple solution of the difficulty, and
the idea was adopted with acclamation.
But when the Assembly thus stole from
the people their right to a share in the
making of the Federal Constitution, it natur-
ally occurred to the Council that it should
have a share in the steal. The Assembly
distrusted the people because they were in
the main Democratic and could only be made
to return a Tory majority by hard and un-
scrupulous disfranchisement. The Council,
which doesn’t represent the people at all, dis-
trusted the Assembly, which represents them
a little, because it feared that the latter
wanted to steal its authority as well as
that of the public ; because, in fact, it looked
like an Assembly that would steal anything.
Therefore, the Council amended the Bill to
give itself an equal share in the appointment;
and the Lower House disagreed, and the
Upper House refused to consider the dis-
agreement, and the Convention Bill has
grown soiled and frayed since then with being
rushed back and forward from one House to
another to no purpose, and the business gets
no further advanced. The matter which the
measure is supposed to be about has almost
dropped out of sight; the general interest is
centred on catching hold of the mangled car-
case of the scheme the instant it is thrown
over the fence from the other branch of the
Legislature, and throwing it back again with
all possible vigor, and the scheme itself is in
the air most of the time, or else striking the
earth with a thud and rebounding, and the
Federal question has settled down to a
general state of football-scrum and mud-
scramble.
* * * ♦
The difficulty is in one respect opportune ;
it draws special attention to the one thing
which is particularly wanting in the consti-
tutions of all the seven provinces, and which
must be supplied in the Federal constitu-
tion if it is to be a workable piece of
machinery. Not one of the political systems
of Australasia makes any provision for
settling the deadlocks which so frequently
arise under the bi-cameral system. Each
Constitution provides one way in which any
new act of legislation may be effected, by
each Chamber agreeing on it three times in
succession, and the two Chambers taking
exactly the same view of all the details, and
then by the Governor giving his assent and
the British Government not exercising its
power of disallowance. If all these authori-
ties agree on all the details of a measure,
then something may be done. On the other
hand, there are at least seven ways in which
things may be left undone. A new measure
may be rejected in either House, or it may
be left unfinished in either House, or it may
be passed in both Houses with some altera-
tions of greater or less importance, and then
lost because one House dissents from the
other’s alterations. Finally, if it passes both
Houses it may be vetoed by the Governor,
and if it passes the Governor also it may be
vetoed by the British authorities. The two
last-named obstacles, however, seldom create
serious trouble now-a-days ; they exist, cer-
tainly, but they do not constitute an impor-
tant feature of the deadlock. But the two
Houses of Parliament, in most of the Aus-
tralias, live in a chronic state of more or less
violent disagreement. They are, in most
cases, so constituted as to represent conflict-
ing interests in every respect. They are
carefully designed so as to take opposite
views on almost every question of national
importance, and there is no provision what-
ever for holding the balance between them.
Consequently, legislation is a football-match
without an umpire, or a horse-race with-
out a judge, or an arbitration where each
party conducts its own case and there is
no arbitrator to give a decision between
them. The constitution simply provides
that one branch of the Legislature may decide
upon one course and the other branch may re-
solve on another, and then the two parties are
left to shriek at each other indefinitely to no
purpose. The situation is exactly the same as
if the Judge was omitted out of the legal
system, and the plaintiff and defendant were
left to state their cases to each other, and if
they both agreed then a verdict could be
given, and if they didn’t agree then they
were left to state their cases to each other
till they collapsed from old age, or talked
each other to death, or the matter fell
through from exhaustion or paralysis or
similar causes.
In the Queensland deadlock the people are
very little interested in either the Assembly’s
or the Council’s view of the case ; what they
most want is that some kind of a settlement
will be arrived at, and which settlement is
arrived at matters but little. The people do
not elect the Convention delegates either way,
therefore in neither case will these individuals
be anything like fairly representative of the
people. The question really at issue is
whether the delegates will be appointed by
the Tory party in the Assembly, which party
is w'holly out of sympathy with the mass of
the community, or partly by it and partly by
the equally unsympathetic Tory party
in the Council. The people will be
almost equally misrepresented in each
case, therefore they care very little at heart
how the row eventuates. But a considerable
proportion of the people want Federation,
and want Queensland to adhere to the
Convention, and what concerns them is that
the row shows no signs of coming to any
definite result at all. -To them one solution
of the difficulty is about as good or as bad as
the other, but the worst thing of all will
be no solution whatever. The British
legislative system, which gives unlimited
scope for the creation of deadlocks but makes
no provision at all for solving them, here
reveals its weakness most conspicuously.
The community and both branches of the
Legislature profess to desire the same result,
but because the two Houses choose to
squabble over a personal detail, which the
people would probably be equally willing to
settle either way so long as it was settled,
matters are at a standstill.
* * * *
There are various expedients by which the
Convention, if there ever is one, may pro-
vide against such deadlocks in the Federal
Legislature. Some of them are more demo-
cratic or simpler or more workable than
others, and the constitution - makers may
either choose one of the ready-made expe-
dients now in use in various parts of the
world, or construct a new one of their own.
The most essential matter is that there should
be some efficient method of getting a definite
decision on every question submitted to
Parliament. The present system by which
the Legislature is divided into two authorities
almost equal in power, which may, and often
do, take diametrically opposite views on
some detail of a large question, and by
which neither view prevails except by
accident, is cumbersome and stupid and
wholly unsatisfactory. A settlement might
be arrived at by submitting questions on
which the two Houses disagree to a popular
vote. It might also be arrived at by making
the two Houses sit as one for the purpose of
taking a combined vote on any measure or
clause or detail on which agreement cannot
be otherwise arrived at, the decision of the
combined Legislature to be final. A third
expedient is to make deadlocks betiveen the
two Houses impossible by having only one.
Still another device is to give the popular
Chamber power to overrule the Council’s
decision, provided a two - thirds or a
three - fourths or some other specified
majority votes for so doing. Again,
the difficulty may be overcome by giving the
Assembly power to overrule the Council's rejec-
tion or amendment of a measure, provided a
vote to that effect is carried in two successive
Parliaments or in two or more successive
sessions. These are a few of the possible
ways out of the difficulty ; they are not
equally logical or equally politic, but they all
lead to some distinct result, and the worst of
them is better than having no way out of
the difficulty as at present. The policy by
which the legislative power is entrusted to
two separate authorities who are so con-
structed as to think as differently as possible
and to differ as often and as violently as
possible, and by which nothing can be done
unless they think alike, causes waste of time
and energy, and ceaseless friction, and has
nothing save its slowness, indefiniteness, and
exasperation to recommend it.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
“Permanent and Reproductive.”
During the ensuing year the Government of
New South Wales proposes to spend £2,000,000
of borrowed money on various kinds of works,
and thereby create a fresh outbreak of pros-
perity, and a revival of industry, and all the
other beautiful things that are always done
with borrowed money in the Great Loan Land.
Even according to N.S. W. ideas £2,000,000 is a
tolerably large financial orgy for one year,
though not nearly so large as some past orgies
have been. The expenditure, according to the
Government’s humorous way of putting it, is
for “permanent and reproductive works,”
which presumably means that all the works are
both permanent and reproductive—though it
may be intended to read that some of them are
reproductive and the rest are permanent. A
casual study of the details, however, suggests
that the title is a delusion and the loan policy a
swindle, whichever reading is adopted. Among
the items which are to be paid out of borrowed
money, so as to avoid paying them out of
revenue and thus damaging next year’s surplus,
are “ 1000 magazine rifles, £14,000,” and the
magazine rifle isn’t permanent and was never
accused of being reproductive. Another
£26,000 of “reproductive expenditure” is for
submarine mines and other military equipments;
£25,000 is for the scrub-cutting work which
was invented as a relief for the unemployed ;
£.3690 for a new road at Robertson ; and
£51,000 is for building bridges. Not one of
these items will yield a single penny of direct
revenue, and the Government which calls
them “reproductive” and which describes
scrub-cutting as “permanent” is a most
amazing Ananias. Further on, ,£l] 8,000
is to go in building hospitals, court-houses, luna-
tic asylums, the foundation of Governor Phil-
lip’s statue—think of old gaol-flogger Phillip’s
statue as a reproductive work !—repairs to the
Australian Museum, and the like ; £131,000
goes in non-productive drainage works ; £54,000
for museums, art galleries, &c. ; £6OOO for some
works at Jenolan Caves; and £325,000 for
dredging and other river improvements. Then,
under the head of “ other works,” £6135 is set
aside for wood-blocking King-street, Newtown ;
£56,500 for more bridges ; £49,000 for more
court-houses, gaols, lock-ups, police-stations,
&c., and £3OOO for “the better disposal of
sludge at Cook’s River.” Out of a total of
£2,020,000, something like £1,031,000 is for
works that yield actual revenue, and the con-
struction of which with borrowed money is
therefore more or less justifiable on the ground
that they will repay at least part of the interest
on their cost; £248,000 may be classed as
doubtful; and £741,000 (including the wood-
blocking of King-street, the magazine rifles,
roads, bridges, repairs to roof of Museum, dis-
posal of sludge at Cook’s River, Governor
Phillip’s statue, &c.) is mere degraded swindle
and cooking of the public accounts, whereby
next year’s surplus will be provided for and the
Reid Govt, be enabled to blare once more about
its “ sound finance,” and the “ prosperous state
of the country,” and the way its “policy has
been vindicated.” The nefarious system of
making the surplus or minimising the deficit by
charging works which yield no revenue and
items of casual expenditure to loans has always
prevailed in N.S. Wales, but it never assumed
its most aggravated form till the Reid Govern-
ment came into office. A larger proportion of
the borrowings now goesin non-productive works
than ever before; and all manner of repairs
and patches, which the worst of former Govern-
ments paid out of revenue for want of the
requisite “ cheek ” to do anything else, are now
cheerfully passed on to posterity. The Minis-
try which can charge Governor Phillip’s statue
to loans as a “ permanent and reproductive
work ” should be capable of anything under the
sun in the way of financial dodgery.
Victoria’s Lost Province.
Melbourne Champion wants to know if there
is any way of stopping the exodus from Vic-
toria, and if there is it desires the man who
understands the way to rise up and explain
himself forthwith. The Victorian exodus has
certainly been pretty bad of late years. In
three years—lß92-3-4—the population of the
province only increased by 12,000 ; there was
no actual diminution as is commonly supposed,
but as the increase by the excess of births over
deaths should have been about 60,000, these
figures show that a very large clearing-out has
taken place. Victoria, in fact, has been in a
state of something not much better than stag-
nation, and the Tory press says unanimously
that the reason of it is that the Government
doesn’t go in for “ practical legislation ” —what
kind of practical legislation should be gone in
for the Tory press never states, for the suffi-
cient reason that it doesn’t know. The great
trouble in Victoria now-a-days is actual want
of space, and The Bulletin’s idea of a remedy
is to open up the lost province of Gippsland,
and try to make it as accessible as the
rest of the country, and thereby give the
cramped Gumsucker a little more elbow-room.
Victoria is a very small spot of ground. In
the west and north-west about one-third of it is
a flattened-out and dismal waste of pipe-clay
plains, salt, sand, mallee, and other arid abomi-
nations. There is no permanent water-supply
on these plains ; no artesian water so far as is
known ; practically no population, and no pro-
spect of population that is worth mentioning
until the water - difficulty is settled. The
eastern third of the province is a fertile, well-
watered region which has also no population
worth speaking of, because roads are few' and
bridges fewer, and railways practically none at
all. It has been neglected because the old boom
politicians found it easier to keep building
public works on the central plain than to tackle
this difficult mountain country ; consequently,
the Victorian population is mostly crowded
into one narrow strip of land, and this strip is
about six times as thickly populated as any
other country district in Australia, and its in-
habitants are beginning to slop over into ad-
jacent provinces from sheer pressure. The
Government which sets to work in dead
earnest to open up Gippsland ought to put
an end to the Victorian exodus. In that
region there are four large counties which
are not touched by a railroad, and two
more which have about a dozen miles of line
between them. Victoria is 420 miles long from
east to west, and if one draws a bee-line on the
map westward from Cape Howe it is 220 miles
before it crosses a railroad. There are only
18,000 acres of cultivation in five large counties
of eastern Gippsland : there is no port —the
raw 7 material of three or four harbors is there,
but nothing has been done to improve them ;
and the population is very little more than 0 to
the square mile. Yet Gippsland is about the
most beautiful, probably the best-watered, and
in its valleys almost the most fertile part of
Australia, and if it could be made thoroughly
accessible it would make room for another half-
million Victorians and add a new territory
to the land of the dejected Gumsucker. The
people who want to know how to stop the Vic.
exodus should think over this matter very hard.

The Stinkful Turf.
The Argus recorded some small turf transac-
tions (bogus for the most part) on the night
when Melb. Cup acceptances were published,
under the head of “ Heavy Wagering.” To such
pitiable attempts at working-up a carnival
excitement has “ great ” journalism descended.
There is no possibility of heavy wagering nowa-
days. W. R. Wilson tested the Caulfield Cup
market with a commission to back Resolute for
a pretty big stake, and found to his disgust that
the market was well-nigh exhausted by the
effort of laying £3OOO in all against Resolute at
short prices. A short commission for The
Chevalier for Melb. Cup brought the animal
from 25 to 1 to half the odds immediately. A
genuine investment of “a couple of quid ”

creates a stir among the Hebrew layers these
times, and when one of the smaller fry—how
many larger fry are there ?—lays the odds to a
“tenner” he looks pale and anxious until he
has shared a portion of his risk with a
brother Ikey. If outside punters were
aware of the real financial condition of the
inner racing world they would pay no attention
to the early Cup “betting” which is printed
for their misguiding by sporting editors.
Bogus figures and lying statements are the
rule. A trainer, who hasn’t a feather to fly
with, is reported as winning a “nice stake”
over some horse which he backed for £5 on
“tick.” Stone-broke owners are said to give
their champions a “ spirited support.” As for
the true reason why cronk running is so
general—viz., the inability of jockey-boys to
get the price of their riding fees from anybody
except bookmakers, who will pay them to lose
—it is never even hinted at in turfy columns.
Many jockeys would starve if they were
confined to their legitimate professional earn-
ings, seeing that their impecunious employers
(nominal employers) don’t pay them anything
for months at a stretch. Leaving a few
wealthy or well-to-do owners out of the question,
it may be said that the racing-game is run
almost entirely by bookmakers, the majority of
whom are such small capitalists that they can’t
afford to gamble heavily, and therefore can’t
fix their own intentions until they get a good
idea of how the public sovereigns are likely to
be placed. The Australian racing community
—make no patriotic mistake about it—is about
the most rotten community that exists.
Vic’s Alleged Upper House.
Are the Vic. Consolidated Acts (1890) merely
a text-book by George Higinbotham— only
that and nothing more ? If so, Vic. Legislative
Council is merely the bunghole of a mythical
barrel. Attorney-General Isaacs, in fossicking
out the constitutional position of the Adult
Vote Bill before the Assembly, stumbled on the
paradox that the impregnable eternal Leg.
Council has been recruited for six years by
invalid elections. The Act of ’Bl says that
persons on the voters’ roll may vote at Council
elections without taking out an electors’ right,
and consequently only the few people who vote
at Council elections on some oilier than the
property qualification do take out rights. The
Consolidated Act of 1890 leaves out all mention
of the voters’ roll, therefore under it every
Council elector must have a right. And as the
property voter never has one the inference is
that 144,903 people who thought they were
electors are nothing of the kind, and there
are only 726 real Leg. Council electors
in the province, and some of the fossils
have really no constituents at all, and
the situation is too complicated for ex-
planation. Of course, if the consolidated
Acts are simply the irresponsible private
opinion of George Higinbotham, deceased
(and tlie decision of the Supreme Court in
Mercantile Bank v. Hall has hitherto been
widely accepted as affirming something very
like that), then the Leg. Council can proceed
with its task of thwarting the popular will in
the name of Property. If (in the immortal
language of an Age leader-writer) the unfolded
bombshell proves to be a mare’s nest, then the
48 Men in Possession will continue their watch
and ward in the goods and chattels of Victoria.
But if Isaacs is right, and the Men in Posses-
sion are merely trespassing, then there are
going to be brave times down South. The Age
puts the position in its very mildest form :
It will be an opportunity for the Assembly to exercise
a little gentle pressure. Let the Council pass “ One-man-
one-vote ” and woman’s suffrage, and the Assembly will
readily consent to amend the flaw in the act as far as the
Council is concerned. If the Council prove intractable,
then, apparently there is a means of suspending them
altogether. There is much force in the remark of a mem-
ber of the Cabinet last night that the situation is very
serious.
A irivial price to ask ! Nothing less than the
Referendum would do. But if the Leg. Council
is merely a gang of interlopers, how can it
rat : fy its own existence ? What is the good of
bringing in a bill, as is proposed, to let the 48
say they are really bailiffs and not trespassers?

The Suffield Case.
Thomas Suffield still waits in gaol the tardy
consideration of his case by the N.S. W. Minister
for Justice, and, to all appearance, unless Par-
liament takes a hand in the matter, he is likely
to wait a long time. It is now five weeks since
Minister Gould engaged to lay the papers in
the case on the table of the Leg. Assembly, and
at time of writing they are not yet to hand. In
the ordinary course, papers which are promised
by a Minister are brought forward almost im-
mediately—in a few days, in a week at most.
Why this singular delay in the Suffield case ?
Does the Department feel so guilty—of negli-
gence, or incompetence, or worse ? Or does it
dread the consideration of the case in the
free light of day, and with all the facts
available ? The suppression has a sinister air.
The Bulletin has not yet lost hope, however ;
and meantime it prints some remarks
made by Suffield himself. Suffield, it
will be remembered, was charged with outrag-
ing Croudace’s servant-girl almost under the
windows of her employer’s house at 10 o’clock
in the evening. And he comments acutely :
The Crotjdaces heard shrieks. Did no one else of all
that household hear the shrieks ? There was no evidence
of it. Who then sat up to let the girl in ? The household
must have known she was out. Was she supposed to let
herself in? Then she, a servant of a respectable em-
ployer, had carte blanche to stop out till the small hours.
Did Frank Croudace sit up to let her in ? If he did not,
who did ? And why didn’t the sitter-up (if there was one)
first hear the shrieks ?
Again, Croudace said to his son Frank, “Let’s take
sticks.” Does this not point to some knowledge on the
part of the speaker of the particular kind of danger to be
encountered— viz., from the bull?
Why did the prosecutrix pick upon me? Well, it was
shown that I was about the only man she knew in the
neighborhood. She did not know me, but had seen me
and asked my name. Now, a man named Campbell swore
that he passed prosecutrix on the road on the night in
question, and, if my memory serves me, he said that
“ she stopped, turned round, and had a good look at
him.” Campbell is a man about my own size, and has
something of my appearance. He used to wear a hat
like mine. If prosecutrix met him on that lonely road
in the vicinity of the house where she knew me to be
living, and in the dim semi-darkness of a summer’s night,
don’t you think it probable she would conclude the
passer-by to be Suffield ? Campbell stated in his evi-
dence that he was walking fast.
I am certain prosecutrix mistook Campbell for me;
and, thinking therefore that I was alone on that road
about the time of the occurrence, she felt safe afterwards
in swearing that I was her assaulter.
I was out on the Sunday. Was I watching all day the
trams by which prosecutrix would return from Wallsend ?
If I were not, how could I return home, contemplating
the execution of an outrage, changing my clothes with
the object of intercepting prosecutrix, and hitting the
time of her return exactly, almost to a minute ? Do not
forget, too, that I am supposed to have directed my
step towards Croudace’s house, instead of towards the
bush road, where, were I a brute, I could have accom-
plished a cruel outrage, at the danger of my own life;
and all to procure a passing pleasure which, to put it
bluntly, I could have enjoyed with safety, security, and
reciprocity, any hour of my life, any evening, in Lambton
or in Newcastle.
In view of all the circumstances of the case,
these arguments seem to The Bulletin very
strong in Suffield’s favor. “ I know my own
innocence,” pleads the prisoner, “ but I know
also that I have to convince the public of my
innocence, and so I appeal to the public reason
to say whether on the evidence 1 was fairly
adjudged guilty.”
Lady Tichborne, wife of the present holder of
the title, strikes Australia in the nick of time.
Edward Priestman, who is engineering the
movement to take Cresswell out of Parra-
matta (N.S.W.) Lunatic Asylum, and “restore
him to his rightful place ” as Roger Tichborne,
is just about to move N.S.W. Supreme Court
to deliver Cresswell over, if his pending appli-
cation to Govt, isn’t granted. Lady Tich-
borne can stay and report progress. Priest-
man is badly bitten witii the Tichborne mania,
has spent some £2OO on behalf of Cresswell
already, and has accumulated “proofs”
enough to fill a clothes-basket. Also, he
is armed with a power of attorney
from a R.C. clergyman in England who
was a great friend of Roger Tichborne’s
mother; and is prepared to plank down £SOO
as guarantee that Cresswell will be well kept
and safely returned if the clothes-basketful of
proofs shouldn’t be sufficient. That being so,
there seems no reason why N.S.W’. Govern-
ment should hang on to Cresswell any longer.
He may be Tichborne, or he may not: it isn’t
any business of Govt.’s. All Govt, has to con-
sider is that a respectable person is willing to
take the cost of Cress well’s keep off the per-
spiring taxpayer ; and if Govt, could turn over
every harmless inmate in the asylums to friends
on similar terms it would make a very good
bargain.
If the reports as to night-sittings presided over
by N.S.W. minor Judge Docker are correct—it
is stated that juries in criminal cases have been
sitting before His Honor for 18 hours contin-
uously and not rising till 3.45 a.m. ! —the Judge
should at once be removed from the Bench.
After the gross scandals incidental to the reign
of the unspeakable Judge Windeyer, surely
the people of N.S. Wales do not contemplate
setting up a tinpot imitation of the man from
Tomago ! Before entering upon the protracted
night-sittings complained of His Honor “ put it
to the jury ” whether they would adjourn or con-
tinue. Judges know, or should know, that the
hearing of a criminal charge is not for the con-
venience of the jurors, is not for the convenience
of the judge, but is for the extension of a fair
trial to the accused. These are the three courses
open—(l) To dismiss or otherwise regulate Mr.
Docker ; (2) to pass an eight-hour sitting bill
with regard to criminal trials ; (3) to enact that
in cases where juries are being Dockered, they
shall, at intervals of four hours during every
night-sitting, receive hypodermic injections of
cocaine sufficient to brace them up for the occa-
sion. However, while any person of the Gould
type poses as Minister of Justice, it is hopeless
to effect a radical remedy.
Most of the Sydney “tote” and “double”
shops are in full blast at present, and have
been that way for a long time past, and the
weary policeman w r hose business it is to raid
them and make the owners sit up cometli not.
A few weeks ago the police, knowing that the
law was being habitually and wilfully broken,
and having the names and addresses of the
people who were doing the breakage, went
round and didn’t arrest them, but gently
warned them not to do it any more. Since
then they have mostly kept on doing it, and
the policeman, apparently, hasn’t been around
again. Also the GoD-fearing Ministry doesn’t
seem to have inquired why the police failed to
do their duty and run in these persistent law-
breakers instead of giving them a friendly
warning that they might dodge the due conse-
quences of their misdoings, and wdiy they keep
on not doing their duty, and why the depart-
mental bosses don’t make them do it, and how
much is paid for this immunity, and who gets
the payment, if any. Also the officer who so
badly misunderstoorl his duties as to go Tound
paying friendly calls on the malefactors and
giving them the “ tip ” doesn’t seem to have
been sacked, and his superior, who presumably
sent him on his unlawful errand, is still, so far
as the public are aware, enjoying his billet and
his salary in peace. Wherefore The Bulletin
sadly opines that the Stiggins Government
is a sham and a humbug, and backs doubles on
the sly when its colleague, Local Preacher
Cook, isn’t looking.
The arguments by which North Melb. worsted
Prahran in the recent A.N.A. debate are good
enough for standards. “The magic of private
property in land,” said Prahran, “enables
men to cultivate the barren rock, and turn the.
sandy desert into a garden.” “ Why,” en-
quired N. Melb., “ should men be forced to cul-
tivate the barren rock and sandy desert when
good, arable land lies idle in the clutches of
monopoly ? The magic of private ownership
is the magic of monopoly, which does not enable
but forces men to cultivate the rock and deserts.
There is truly a magic in private ownership of
land, for by what other name could you call
that power which forced Ireland to send, during
a period of famine, more than five times the
produce necessary to feed her people to pay
rent to the absentee landlord? That truly is
magic which has turned the erstwhile smiling
glens of Scotland into a habitation for wild
beasts—which enabled the Marquis of Stafford
to supplant 15,000 small farmers by 39 sheep
farmers. Compared with this nmgic the blackest
arts are virgin white.” “But,” said Prahran,
“Vic. Govt, has failed to collect the rents of
the land it already holds.” N. {Melb. retorted
that the Govt, has collected more than the rents
of the Mallee settlers : what it has failed to do
is to collect their purchase money. “As long
as they pay rent they are surely entitled to
occupy.” “ And,” said Prahran, “Vic. Govt,
has failed to manage the railways satisfactorily.”
To which N. Melb. responded that Vic. rail-
ways pay working expenses and 2 3-4 per cent,
on cost of construction. The cost of construc-
tion was largely the cost of buying back, at
fabulous prices, the land upon which to build
the railways. “ The railway muddle is not
because the Govt, owns the railways, but
because the Govt, does not own the land.”
Truly a neat antithesis.
The following interesting comparative table of
the pawnbrokers’ charges allowed in England
under an Act of George 111. and at pre-
sent, also in Victoria, is taken from a
cogent article on “ Usury and Pawnbrokers’
Charges” in the current number of Austra-
lasian Law Times :
The Victorian Act has not been altered since
1865, and in the forthcoming legislation re
usury, Victoria will be acting tenderly to thou-
sands of her most helpless people, if she will
in this matter follow in the footsteps of effete
and feudal England.
Considering how much has been heard about
that alleged quality of “ British fair-play,” and
how constantly John Bull rises to state, on his
own authority, that this spirit of fairness and
impartiality is his most beautiful characteristic,
a recent cablegram from Hingland is tolerably
sickening. A Transvaal gentleman was in-
vited, or at least permitted and authorised, to
deliver a lecture before the Imperial Institute.
Then, having gothim on the platform, the audi-
ence drowned the lecture in howls of “ traitor,”
“cur,” “ruffian,” and similar hog-language,
the reason of the outbreak being that the lec-
turer had “sympathised” with the Boers,
when buccaneer Jim raided their country, and
hadn’t whooped for the invading filibuster as
the meeting considered he should have done.
In addition to heaving language at the lecturer
the hysterical crowd waved flags promiscuously
and cheered for Jameson, and came within an
ace of winding up the proceedings with a free
fight and a general shedding of nose-blood all
over the premises. This rowdy incident
seems to show that a gathering of cul-
tured Englishmen can be just about as black-
guardly as a South American mob when
once it gets on its patriotic ear. Also, it sug-
gests that the cultured Briton-has just the same
idea of fair-play as anybody else—in ether
words, his idea is that everybody must think
the way he thinks or have a brick thrown at
him. Further, the strong, calm Anglo-Saxon
who objects so much to the hysterics of other
races appears to be as frantic and childish as
other people when his own particular corn is
trodden upon. Supposing “Dr. Jim’’had been
a Boer who carried invasion and butchery into
Natal, what would his neck have been worth,
and how much applause would he have got
from the fair-minded Englishman ? And how
does the Englishman’s enthusiasm over
Jameson because he illegally killed a good
many Dutchmen compare —in a spirit of British
fair-play—with his fury against Major Lothaire
who illegally killed one Englishman ? And
when the Englishman whoops over one butcher
and the Belgian cheers for the other, how much
is there to choose between the hysterics of the
two races ?
The Tas. Great Western debate produced an
unexpected consequence. The shameless Bill
having passed its second reading earlier than
was expected, the members opposing it an-
nounced their intention of stonewalling in com-
mittee, and accordingly began to do so on Oct.
29, at 7 p.m., kept it upall night, and continued
till about 12.30 on Friday, Oct. 30. Then
Henry Dobson arose to move “ that the
question be put,” in accordance with the
rule of the House of Commons and under the
rule of the Tas. .Standing Orders, which provides
that any applicable rule of the Commons not
on the Tasmanian Orders (if on the Commons
Orders when Tas. Orders were last revised)
shall be extended to Tasmanian procedure. The
Acting-Chairman ruled that the motion was
regular, and put it. It was carried on division,
amid prolonged yells of “ Gag ” from the Oppo-
sition. Thus (in the interests of a gridironing
syndicate) was the closure introduced into
Tasmanian politics.

Vic. Radicals have always feared that the
politics of Attorney-General Isaacs, “ like the
morality of a bishop,” were too good to be true.
In 1892, as a Pattersonite, he supported the
dual vote, &c., but in 1893, when he danced on
the ruins of Patterson, he hauled up the
Radical flag, and has since posed as an opponent
of boodling bankers and company-swindlers
generally. He has brilliance and energy, and
is a nightmare to the Tories. Opportunist or
not, the gibes of such men as G. D. Carter
rouse his fighting spirit, and force him to nail
his flag to the mast. The wounded eagle felt a
deeper pang to see its own feather on the fatal
arrow—and perhaps some day the reactionaries
of Vic. will shudder to see that every nail
fastening the Isaacs flag is a Tory taunt.
Vic. Artists’ Society.
The Vic. Artists’ Society is holding another an-
nual exhibition of paintings at its ill-fated gallery
in Albert-street, Melbourne. Regarded as a shil-
ling show, this exhibition is seemingly the direst
failure ever achieved by the Society—a “ frost ”of
“ frosts.” In artistic merit, or pretension, it is not
so far below the average of recent years as to
account for the increased indifference of the general
public. Evidently Melbourne has wearied of local
art-eccentricities, or else the humble necessary
shilling charged for admission is now felt to be
more than the sentiment of culchaw can afford-
One wouldn’t care to pay more than a dozen pence
for sole possession of some of the new works that
figure in an annual exhibition of Victorian paint-
ings. Why not fix the gate-money at a threepenny-
bit and implore the masses to roll up ?
* * * *
From this disconsolate gathering of canvasses,
mostly too large for the subjects depicted on them,
works by Longstaff, John Forde Paterson, D.
Davies, and Douglas Richardson are conspicuously
missing. The last-named artist has in former
years usually contributed some efforts that aimed
at the sublime, and, though they did perhaps
sometimes hit the ridiculous, The Bulletin is
none the less sorry at finding their author unrepre-
sented on this melancholy occasion. Among the
few well-known workers who do exhibit, Mr.
Tucker appears to have a place of honor for his
“ Confidences ” —a girl in a limp white robe and a
very questionable frame of mind, resting her head
upon the shoulder of a nice, sympathetic matron.
Nobody, save the artist, can tell whether the letter
which the damsel holds in her hand is an offer
of matrimony, a “breaking-off” epistle, or a
threatening demand from the milliner. She may
be sad or happy. Anyway, the matter is serious.
There is much conscientious painting in sundry
parts of the picture, but the girl’s pose is mysteri-
ous. She may be sitting on a stool. It is impos-
sible to say how she is disposing of her legs, or
whether she has any human legs at all under the
white robe. Bernard Hall shows, in a small
frame, a nicely-drawn and tinted nude figure of a
not well-formed female— i.e., nicely-drawn down
to the feet, which are probably too large and ugly
to be true even to the model. She is entitled a
“ Nymph,” and the subject, against a dark-green
background, is certainly chaste in effect. All the
same, it is disillusioning. J. C. Williamson would
probably hesitate before engaging such a nymph
for tights.
* * * *
F. M'Cubbin’s “ Winter Evening ” has a study
of scattered ti-trees on a piece of sandy cliff with
a gaily variegated sea and sky beyond. Artistic,'
but unconvincing. The tree trunks are the color
of plum juice, also the sand. Nos. 69 and 21 are
lamentable works by Walter Withers, in painful
contrast with his more ambitious “ Storm,” a wet
and windy landscape that commands praise. Here
everything is well-placed and in harmony with
nature. Flagrant examples of Vic. art-coloring
(picked at random from many such) are No. 70,
an old man’s head, and No. 33—“ Beach at Hamp-
ton.” The latter, painted by Handasyde, is
praiseworthy in most things save color, which is
the thing of chief importance. J. C. Waite shows
a heartily-welcome “ Australian Sunset" —sheep
browsing on a glorified grassy plain, a common-
place style of picture, unduly large for the theme,
but essentially pretty and quite free from extrava-
gances. The bizarre influence of Holman Hunt
is suggested by one among sundry sea and shore
pictures by Mather, whose work as a rule seems to
be waning in naturalism.
» * * *
The self-assurance of young Victorian “ art ” is
typified in No. 28, a smudgy, hideous “impres-
sion ”of a child in a pinafore. This is called “A
Wdd Rose” on the frame, and the painter has
attached a verse to the title. Apart from its pre-
sence on the frame this verse has no visible refer-
ence to the child, but it speaks eloquently of the
artist’s regard for that awful infant. Several
works from Sydney—including Tom Roberts’
hard, stiff, ludicrous “Bailed Up”—are displayed
among the aforesaid local productions in oil, but it
is in the water-color department that visiting
talent is best asserted.
“The Vagabond.”
Dear Bulletin, —In the rush of obituary matter
on the late Julian Thomas there is scarcely amen
tion of the man’s generous and kindly nature. As
one who knew him well give me space for a word
or two on the subject. When Miss Sutherland
started rescue-work amongst neglected children in
Victoria she got her first donation—.£lo —from
“ The Vagabond.” To young writers seeking his
aid or advice he was a tower of strength. A story
of suffering humanity never failed to bring tears
to his eyes and money from his purse. It was as
much due to his (often misdirected) charity as to
his unlucky mining ventures in Kimberley and
Queensland that “The Vagabond ” died so'poor.
The nuns of Abbotsford Convent and the Little
Sisters of the Poor for many years offered
prayers for the spiritual welfare and ultimate con-
version “to our Holy Church ” of the famous
journalist who had so often aided them. Now the
gentle creatures are doubtless putting up petitions
to get his soul out of Purgatory. An Argus
leader once referred to “The Vagabond ” as a man
whom children and dogs instinctively followed.
And “The Vag.” himself was fond of telling how,
at his first interview with editor Haddon, the
latter’s Gordon setter —a most conservative animal
—after a short inspection of the visitor, came for-
ward and laid a paw on his knee. “By George ! ”
exclaimed the editor, “now I know you are a
good fellow.” Strolling with him one day, we
came upon a dog which had been run over by a
vehicle and left dying. “The Vagabond” took
the creature in his arms, carried it to a chemist’s
and spent a half-crown, which he could ill-afford,
to give it a painless death by chloroform. The
evening before his death, when driving in from
Heidelberg, he overtook a poor woman and her
ragged offspring trudging ahead. They were
given a place in “ The Vag.’s ” cab and driven to
their destination. Small as these items are,
they indicate a very gentle aspect of a
strong man’s character. Amongst the obituary
Vagabondia in The Bulletin, there appeared
the statement that certain indications pointed
to a remote infusion of African blood. This is
news indeed to the “Vag.’s” friends! And the
portrait which accompanies the ably-written sketch
conveys a most unflattering and vulgarised idea of
Julian Thomas’ powerful if irregular personality.
I have always understood that he was a Vir-
ginian by birth. He certainly knew the country
minutely. He also knew stony-hearted Fleet-
street to his sorrow. I take it that his
early youth was, in a sense, a bitter one,
probably through narrow religious training.
“ Childhood’s mental suffering,” he used to say,
“is terrible because of its impotence.” When
“ The Story of an African Farm ” was read aloud
to him, the passages descriptive of the spiritual
stress affected him most painfully. He had been
through every phase of the agony and emerged
an unbeliever, constantly reiterating the last four
verses of the third chapter of Ecclesiastes. The
serial story, “Under a Changing Sky,” begun
years ago by “The Vagabond” in the Pacific
Weekly, was, he said, fairly auto-biographical as
far as it went. But it did not go very far. The
paper died in its earliest youth. Though ill-
health and restricted means made pathetic “ The
Vagabond’s ” later years, a little group of friends
which he had grappled to him in better days
stuck closer to him than kindred might, and many
a man who passes away surrounded by a host of
blood relations is less deeply mourned than he who
was Julian Thomas. —]

That fine olde Englyshe comedy, “ She
Stoops to Conquer,” which was written away back
in aboriginal times by an almost forgotten person
named Goldsmith, was the first production of the
new Potter-Bellew season at Sydney Lyceum.
The results may be set down as satisfactory, inas-
much as Mrs. Potter wasn’t nearly so extraordinary
as usual, and her rendering of the heroine wasn’t
by any means the blaze of painted anguish that
most of her heroines amount so. This doesn’t
imply that the rendering was positively good, but
it didn’t come within gunshot of being as bad as
many other things. The heroine was a nicely-
dressed girl with only a moderate amount of affec-
tation, artificial in a good many places, graceful
in some ; a girl who for once didn’t wriggle to any
extent worth mentioning, and, taking her all
round, a good second-rate Miss Hardcastle, with
the paint on her countenance put on in a way that
was reasonably artistic for Mrs. Potter, though it
would have seemed rather startling in a good
many other ladies. The Bulletin can re-
member at a moment’s notice at least six
actresses well-known in Australia who would
have done the part better, and about thirty
who would probably have done it a lot worse.
There are no overwhelming opportunities in the
character of Marlow, but Kyrle Bellew played it
well and brightly, and, but for the whitewash-like
pallor which he is so fond of wearing on his stage-
countenance, there would be no ground for objec-
tion to Marlow anywhere. Tony Lumpkin, by
C. M. Berkeley, was a fine, robust lout, whose
whoop will linger about the rafters of the Lyceum
for weeks to come ; the old reliable Cathcart was
as relia le as ever ; and Miss Linda Raymond, as
Constance Neville, was a pleasant picture to look
upon, and a lady that any right-minded young
man of these days would have eloped with at
sight. Also, Oily Deering deserves mention as a
most effective lout—there are nine louts altogether
in the comedy, and Deering was the most com-
bustible-looking one of the crowd. As for Hast-
ings, he is nothing in particular, except another
nice young man like Marlow, only with a more
serious turn of mind, and with a different colored
coat and long boots of another hue, and he calls
for no special mention.
* * * *
Goldsmith’s comedy was staged for three
nights only, and “Romeo and Juliet,” also for
three nights, was announced to begin on Wednes-
day.
#* * *
Bland Holt’s season at Sydney Royal
closes at the end of next week, when the co,
departs for the city of the unreliable bank balance-
sheet down by Yarra’s smellful shore. The pre-
sent show, so far as is known just now, will fill
in the rest of the season well enough, though the
question why Norman doesn’t suicide as he says
he will seems to come no nearer an answer, and the
fact still sticks out like the lies in a prospectus that
the author has forgotten to mention whether Miss
Vivienne is hanged for shooting the other lady or
not. Also, if she is hanged, what kind of dress
does she wear on the scaffold, and does she break
her swan-like neck when she drops, or has the
executioner to dive down below and hang on to
her feet to finish the tragedy? One thing that is
becoming conspicuous about this co. is that Baker
badly wants a rest from playing the hero. The
hero is practically the same in every melodrama.
He isn't allowed to be amusing for the sake of his
soulful dignity, and he is so beastly good that he
doesn’t get a show to be decently original, and he
can't break things or go out fishing on Sundays
because it is wrong, and he isn’t even permitted as
a rule to be reasonably active, because it wouldn’t
seem to fit in with the Sabbath calm in his soul.
Baker’s talents are wasted as the depressed prig of
melodrama, and if he doesn’t get a chance to be a
soulless murderer now and then for change of air,
decay will assuredly set in.
* *
The drama with the glaring boa-constrictor
in it is doing so well at Her Majesty’s that it will
rage and explode and combust until further
notice. A slight hitch which took place the first
night somewhat damaged one of the sensations—
the scene was changed so hurriedly that Miss
Fanny Wiseman, who was just bursting through
the window in Chinese costume to fight the boa at
close quarters with a knife, hadn’t time to pub-
licly demolish that long, curly intruder, and had
to obliterate him privately behind the scenes.
This has since been remedied, and the boa is now
wiped out in the presence of witnesses, and his
assassin afterwards remarks “ Hoo-ki-lah,” or
some equally unreliable statement. The electrical
machine, The Bulletin is happy to say, has
worked satisfactorily all through. The villain
signs a cheque for the blackmail on a curiously-
contrived desk, and leaves the document on
the exact spot where the button is, and the victim
going to pick it up sets the monster in motion,
consequently a globe of fire the size of a bullock’s
head arises suddenly and blows him over. He
hasn’t time to make any remarks, but simply
shuts up like a well-worn telescope when it is
stood up on end. The only pity is that some way
can’t be found to make use of the furnace in which
the bad man proposes at one time to insert his
young wife alive. If the lady could be shoved
into it for just a moment, and then be rescued
with her hair and her skirts on fire, and her eye-
brows partly destroyed, it would be an effective
scene. But even the boa-constrictor drama has its
limits, and the lady can’t well be thrown to the
furnace and the serpent at the same moment.
* * * *
Last week the Sydney Opera Society rose
on two successive nights and perpetrated “ Mari-
tana,” at Sydney Lyceum, in the presence of an
audience which might have been a good deal
larger than it was. It is only due to the society
to state that it did much less injury to “ Mari-
tana ” than has been achieved at various times by
quite a number of organisations, and the lady has
so far recovered from her wounds as to stand being
repeated at the Criterion on Saturday and Mon-
day. At the same time, the public encourage-
ment given her was hardly sufficient to justify her
in doing herself again at such short notice, and
after Monday it might be well if she retired for a
considerable time. The fact that she wasn’t par-
ticularly bad from an amateur standpoint doesn’t
necessarily imply that there is a great immediate
demand for “ Maritana ” in large quantities,
which, as a matter of fact, there isn’t.
* * * *
Rickards’ new variety artists continue to
drop in at intervals, the latest being Miss Minnie
Goepel and the Allisons. These new arrivals,
having been duly sampled by the Tivoli patrons,
have apparently been approved of. As Coleman
and Miss Alice Leamar are still lingering at the
Tivoli, the co. at present is even stronger than
usual, and sundry other people are due shortly.

Mr. H. J. Samuell, the well-known Sydney
music publisher, leaves shortly for London, and a
benefit concert is to be tendered to him at Sydney
Town Hall on Saturday.

“ Henry V.,” produced on the suitable
stage of Melb. Royal, is a spectacle which does
credit to George Rignold in three respects. Firstly,
it shows his grit in risking so large a show at the
tail-end of a dull season ; also it testifies to his un-
rivalled skill —as far as this country is concerned—
in stage-management ; likewise it re-asserts his
ability to play the name-part with fine effect. To
see and hear George Rignold play Henry Vee at
the Opera House, a dozen years ago, was to feel
inclined to raise one s hat to him ever afterwards.
To repeat that experience at the larger theatre
to-day, is to feel capable of lifting the hat higher
than before. Rignold, of course, is not the fighting
monarch that Shakespeare drew. The Bard lived
in the times of fighting monarchs, and having a
truthful idea of what they were like on an average,
his imagination didn’t soar to the height of this
modern presentment of Henry V. No king could
be half as regal and heroic as Rignold looks.
Human nature doesn’t run to it. Neither does
spectacular-acting capacity run to it in the case of
anybody save “ ’Andsome George,” as far as The
Bulletin is aware. All his mannerisms make for
this particular stage character, and a good deal of
his youth comes back to him when he speaks the
old familiar lines. A naturally-picturesque per-
formance, and therefore not half appreciated.
Probably no artist ever did so well for so little
applause as Mr. Rignold received last Saturday
night. The house was full, and the actor kept the
people in their places until long past their usual
time for stamping off to catch a tram, but they
didn’t, for the most part, know why they were stay-
ing so late. They were interested in the staging of
the show without understanding that the man
created their interest. Or if they understood they
forgot to clap their hands accordingly. George
got one hearty recall during the evening—after the
startling tableau of Agincourt, in the centre of
which he slew the sham rider of a bogus steed.
The impression that King Henry had really killed
the effigy was too strong to be resisted, and they
clamored for his Majesty to come forth from be-
hind the curtains.
* * • *
The Battle of Agincourt aforesaid, the
triumphal return of Henry to London, and the
Cathedral at Troyes form the three special effects
of scenery and supers, whilst several other situa-
tions are almost as imposing. The effect of George
Rignold and his persuasive elocution governs all
these. A long cast of characters includes J. W.
Sweeney, Frank Harcourt, Hazlitt, Stirling
Whyte, and the full strength of the co., several
members being required to appear twice in
different disguises. The sum total of their minor
achievements is fairly satisfactory. It might be
rather less satisfactory, and still the show would
be all right, because it is a one-man show, and
that central individual is an all-round success.
* * #
“Djin Djin,” at the Princess’s, is under
the disadvantage of being revived at a moment
when parents, as a rule, are not taking any Xmas
pantomime. Its magnificence hasn’t faded, but
the glow of novelty is no longer there and the new
people appear to represent a falling-off from the
original, owing to the fact that their jokes have
not had time to drop out of recollection. “ Djin
Djin,” all the same, is quite likely to flourish a
second time. The alluring Lumiere cinemato-
graphe, brought into the third act, was warmly
received on Saturday, and this one item promises
to go for much.
* * « *
On Saturday the Brough Comedy Co. put
in a first appearance at Melb. Bijou, where the
B. & B. firm of old had made a local habitation
and a name. Brough’s reconstructed company,
judging from a furious attack upon the box-plan
before the season started and the roaring of the
multitude at “ A Mother of Three ” after the cur-
tain went up, will bring popularity back to the
Bijou and restore the partially-unclad bulwarks of
society to its dress-circle. “ A Mother of Three,”
as Bulletin readers have already learned, is a
humorous farce, written by a lady, whose jokes
were conceived in a strictly improper spirit.
The only hope of any improvement in the moral
tone of feminine humor rests with the emancipated
spinster who goes scorching on a bike. Miss Clo
Graves being doubtless a lady of the shrinking
violet type, her farce resembles the deep blue sea
in breadth and color.
♦ * * *
Mrs. Brough, in the character of a mother
of triplet daughters (the title, “ A Mother of
Three,” is a concession to male prejudices), dis-
guises herself as her long-lost husband for the sake
of her dear girls. Th w need a father’s presence to
assist them into matrimony, therefore Mrs. Brough
impersonates their other parent and takes up a
commanding position in trousers. This craze for
connubial bliss on the part of the triplets, who have
each been engaged to innumerable young men, is a
physiological enigma, seeing that papa is wedded
to science in Peru whilst their mother has remained
a chaste grass-widow ever since her honeymoon,
eighteen years ago. Papa returns from Peru,
sorry for having neglected his wife so long,
at the very moment when the lady gets into
the clothes he left behind him. Circumstances,
therefore, compel the scientist to regard his dis-
sembled spouse with a dreamy eye of suspicion.
She seems to have taken his vacant place and led
herself astray, the apparent results of her indis-
cretion being two of the triplets whose birth
wasn’t mentioned to their absent father at the
time. “ A Mother of Three ”is more complicated
and many degrees giddier than “ Charley’s Aunt.”
In fact, a suggestion of possibility would make the
plot almost indecent. As the matter stands, it is
very funny.
* * * *
Mrs. Brough achieves the main object,
which is to win laughter for her extravagant cari-
cature of a she-male in distress. Brough, as the
staggered innocent from Peru, gives valuable sup-
port, also Titheradge and Miss Watt-Tanner.
The triplets—Miss Hardy, Miss Austin, and Miss
Lily Titheradge—are successful in seeming young
and anxious to get married, and a stuttering suitor
is neatly done by Majeroni. Here and there a
touch of nature is introduced by a grimy servant
gal. Miss Temple acts the harmless necessary
drudge in question, and acts her well.
*# * *
Frequent changes of bill at the Alexandra
are seemingly powerless against the blight which
has begun to settle upon Dam pier’s season. Sooner
or later the Haleck is always overtaken by the
same old blight, so unless the management can
invoke a miracle the present season may as well
break off suddenly and leave inevitable emptiness
to take its course, The Bulletin fears.
** * *
A rival dramatic power has arisen unex-
pectedly at the little Cambridge Theatre, where
Dan Barry is giving them something peppery at
the lowest possible prices, and the prospects of
both rival powers are about equally unpromising.
Why this awful superfluity of Melb. shows? A
Vitascope is appealing for patronage at the
Athenaeum Hall, and a mysterious irrelevant ad-
vertisement announces that “ Knowles, the famous
London comedian,” has arrived. [Tatt. Adams’
new Sydney theatre not yet being ready to receive
the artists who are arriving from London under
engagement, they are to play awhile in Melb.]
** * *
A Grand Carnival of All Nations com-
menced to rage mildly at Melb. Exhibition Build-
ing last week. With the assistance of warm
weather the Carnival may be expected to go on
raging for some time under substantial Hebrew
patronage. The manager’s name is Israel, and
the prettiest daughters of that famous tribe lend
enchantment to the scene in connection with
raffles and race-games and refreshment-tents
where coffee is only sixpence a cup and
the smile of the amateur waitress costs
nothing at all except a jealous pang when
she beams upon the next customer. The
less fickle attractions of the Carnival are sup-
plied by Fitzgerald Bros. The old reliable
circus performs twice daily in the quadrangle, and
a large collection of beasts of prey—including poor
young John Burns, the lion, who is fast going
blind —clamours for raw meat in an adjoining
tent. Furthermore, the uncanny contortionists
and the lady on the swirling globe, supported by
horse Mahomet and other specialities, give two
entertainments per diem on a platform in the
centre transept. Above all, there is Mdlle.
Antonio, who supports herself at a dizzy height
under the dome until it is time to drop. Then
the lady ascends a few more flights of space
and drops 170 feet into her net in the old sweet
way that passeth all understanding.

Another mention of the fact that Rickards’
Variety Co. crowds the Opera House as usual is
fired off at this point without further comment.
At Poverty Point .
Jemmy MacMahon is now known as “ The Mighty
Atom.”
Actor W. 6. Carey was intended for the R.C. priest-
hood, but a big success as Quilp’s boy, at the old Hay-
market, Bendigo, in the fifties, turned his thoughts to
buskin.
The Australian dramatic run record is held by “ Struck
Oil,” which ran five months in the latter half of 1874 to
an average of £1000 a week.
The tuneful Robert Kennedy, the last performing mem-
ber of the “ family” of that name, has been doing mono-
logue biz. in Perth (W.A.), to good houses. He proposes
next visiting the fields. “ Roabert ” was one of the
trustfu’ Scots who pinned their faith to Jimmy Munro,
and their shekels to his schemes.
“ ‘ Cymbeline,’ for the most part, is stagey trash of the
lowest melodramatic order.” —Saturday Review.
The Maxine Elliot-Nat Goodwin revelations explain
why, before the massive creature arrived, she was so in-
dustriously puffed as the most beautiful woman in the
United States.
Theorbo : “ Nellie Stewart could never have been an
artist in the first line, or rank even with Leonora Braham
or Geraldine Ulinar, in their prime. She performed too
long with the peculiar Australian voice, a piping off the
palate instead of full from the throat. However, with

England contradicting the report that she is likely to sing

Haresfoot: “In reply to me, ‘ Lyceum’ asks what plays
by Pinero, for instance! are fit for Irving,? Not the point.
Though Pinero won’t be dictated to, he wreathes such
works of genius as the ‘Profligate’ and ‘Mrs. Tanqueray’
around performers to his market. Under the inspiration
of a generous offer from Irving, at the zenith, what might
he not have accomplished ? ”

J. E. Sykes was the first of the “ finished musicians” to
tackle Sydney Town Hall organ, as the Mayor put it, and
Ernest Truman has followed suit. There is much weep-

claim.” What the upshot of these appeals will be is only
a matter for conjecture.
It is said that Trebelli required much pressing to give
her two final concerts in Sydney. It was only in response
to a requisition signed by many influential ladies that the

Miss Dora Ohlfsen-Bagge, the pianiste, daughter of the
well-known Sydney engineer, has been obliged to give up
work a-while to recruit her health. She left some time
ago for Berlin, and hard study is said to have affected the
somewhat fragile player. Miss Bagge was a superb artiste
before she left Sydney ; and, unless the writer is much
mistaken, she will ultimately be accounted the finest in-
strumentalist who ever left our shores.

Melbourne Bijou, as it now stands, is a very dainty
theatre. It has undergone much beautifying for the
Brough season, and all the colors used in the decorations
are of the palest and most delicate tints. The co. always
seemed much more at home at the Bijou than at the

Little jokes about Sarah Bernhardt’s figure, published
in English papers, show that the writers have got their
present notions of the tragedienne from days of yore.
This sort of airy comment still crops up frequently:
“Madame Bernhardt says that if she had her choice of
death she would prefer to be struck by a meteor. It is
not, perhaps, rude to suggest that the average meteor
would want something meatier than golden-voiced Sarah,
or it wouldn’t get on the mark at all.” The supposition
that Sarah is as thin as she used to be a quarter of a cen-
tury ago, when her “ bones ” were a cosmopolitan, jest,
still holds good among people who haven’t seen her in the
meantime, if they ever saw her at all. Australia found
the French actress a plump genius, taking pains to make
her figure look less substantial than it really was.
H. : “ Fact copies Fiction. Taking up ‘ The Business ol
Pleasure,’ a book by Edmund Yates, published 1865, I find
a story about an imaginary actor named Dacre, which
bears a startling and most uncanny resemblance to that
of the real actor of that name. The description given of
the man’s appearance and temperament is positively the
same. The Dacre of the yarn is similarly baffled on the
stage. He does not suicide, but dies in a miserable way,
and the actual Dacre appears to be struggling up in every
detail.”
Super. Booker, of Adelaide Fire Brigade, has startled
the local public by reporting that the Exhibition Building
is very badly provided with means of egress in case of
fire. “It can only be compared to a huge matchbox
which, once ignited, nothing short of submersion would
extinguish.” Nor were the patrons of places of public
amusement re-assured when the Architect-in-chief re-
torted that the Exhibition Building is better provided
against an alarm of fire than is the Town Hall.
Lord Fin gal and Myring, the two boss promoters
of the Plunderderry, are said to be the backers of
the man running the drama, “ The Duchess of Cool-
gardie,” in which Hilda Spong is the heroine, in London.
Then why was it not called “ The Duchess of London-
derry ”? Has the “dramer” got a scene in which an
Earl arrives from London to take out of the golden hole a
few tons of gold, removes the iron fence, puts in some
shots, fires them, goes back to pick up the “blasted”
treasure and, to his horror, finds nothing but “ white
quartz”? Hero fiabbergastered, dunno where ’e are—
hardly responsible for his actions, blamed for cabling the
cruel truth to London, instead of sending a private cable
having a few days’ start to enable others to scoot. While
in great despair, is taken out to see the Wealth of Ex-
pectations mine, finds that much worse, and, having no
interest, is instantly cured of despondency and lives the
life of a cheerful Earl ever after. If there is no such
scene, The Bulletin is afraid the dramer will be a failure.
No Coolgardie play is complete without it.

The feeble little pretence at trying the directors
and auditors of the dead City of Melbourne Bank on a
charge of issuing false balance-sheets ended, as everybody
expected all along, in a joyous acquittal. The way the
charge was drafted made a conviction almost impossible
to begin with. The jury was requested to decide whether
the balance-sheet was false, whether the accused issued it
knowing it to be false, and if so, whether they did so
with intent to deceive. Melbourne is about the only
place on this earth where it could be held as possible for
bank officials to knowingly issue a false balance-sheet
without intent to deceive, but in Melbourne pretty nearly
anything is possible. The Judge’s summing-up also reads
in some places like an address for the defence —if the Age
reports it accurately. The case for the defence was
practically that Longtnuir, the Man that’s Dead, had done
all the mischief, and everybody else was as pure as the
driven snow’. Judge Holroyd informed the jury that it
couldn’t convict anybody without also convicting Long-
muir (deceased), which, seeing that deceased hadn’t been
heard in his own defence, looks absurd, both legally and
morally. And the jurymen probably didn’t care to con-
vict a corpse. It w'as also reiterated over and over again
that it might be only the ignorance, or stupidity, or neg-
lect of the board that made it do w’hat it did, and that
the auditors weren’t bound to say anything more than
that the accounts were correct according- to the books
(which weren t correct). And the result of it all is that the
City of Melbourne Bank died from natural causes, anil no
one is accountable. Even the Man that’s Dead seems to
be whitewashed this time. Nobody is responsible for the
bogus balance-sheets, or the trafficking of the bank in its
own shares, or anything else. All these things rose up
and did themselves probably. And it has been laid down
as definitely as possible that if bank officials are paid to do
certain duties, and say they do them, yet leave them un-
done to the ruin of the people who paid and trusted
them, there is no criminality about that whatever. It
isn’t even getting salary under false pretences, appa-
rently.
* * * *
Judge Holroyd, in the City of Melb. Bank case,
on the value of the ordinary auditor’s certificate : “ As to
the auditors, the certificate they gave could not mean
that any item in the statement was correct. It must
mean that the statement was correct so far as the
books disclosed, that so far as they had been able to dis-
cover it was correct. They had a right to rely on the
manager and other officers of the bank in the absence of
suspicious circumstances.” This is interesting seeingthat
quite a number of bank and other auditors simply certify
that the balance-sheet is correct “ according to the books.”
And that kind of certificate, as Holroyd says and as Tiie
Bulletin has been saying for a long while, doesn’t mean
that any item is correct; it actually doesn’t guarantee
one single item. All it amounts to is that the balance-
sheet is just as rotten and dishonest as the books, and no
more so. Then why are such certificates issued, and why
do directors want them and shareholders put up with
them, seeing that their absolute worthlessness is thus
openly acknowledged ?

That solid institution, the United Insurance
Co. (Sydney), shows a premium income for the year of
£97,260 (an increase of £64 on last year), and a net profit
on the fire and marine business of £7331, as compared
with £6062 and £17,908 for two preceding years. The
figures show that insurance business doesn’t leave a
specially gorgeous margin these times. Interest and
rents yield £4134, which is a reasonably good return,
making the total profit for the year £11,465. A 12J4
per cent, dividend absorbs £8528 ; £lOOO is added to re-
serve, making it £53,000; £lOOO to reserve for unad-
justed losses, making it £6OOO ; and £937 carried forward
makes the balance to credit of profit and loss £10,152.
The United has no less than five separate reserves : ordi-
nary reserve, £53,000; re-insurance reserve, £12,500 ;
reserve for unadjusted losses, £6000; for equalisation of
dividends, 12000; and for depreciation of investments,
£lO,OO0 —making £83,500 in all ; also a floating reserve of
£16,416 on profit and loss account, which make altogether
a pretty solid line of defence.
* * * *
The Permanent Trustee Co. of N.S.W. reports
that the profit for the year is £1035. Last year it
amounted to £lOO7, and the one before to £761, so things
are gradually improving. A 4 per cent, dividend absorbs
£lOOO, and the £35 left, added to previous balance of
£795, leaves £B3O at credit of profit and loss. Last year
the Permanent Trustee Co. also paid £lOOO dividend,
leaving £7 to the good, so in two years it has only accu-
mulated £42 towards strengthening its position. This
isn’t a notably large margin. One thing worth noting is,
that though the position is absolutely sound and there is
a steady though gradual improvement in the returns
which promises well for the future, the trustee business
so far hardly seems to pay expenses. At all events, the
co. has £26,194 of its own cash invested, and assuming it
brings in only 4 per cent, (the exact amount it does bring
in doesn t appear, as interest and commission are lumped
together), the income from this source would be 4 1047.
And as the net profits are only £1035 it looks as if the
trustee business hadn't yet reached the paying point,
and the dividends are merely profits realised by the
investment of the shareholders’ own money.

The Langridge Building Society (Melb.) is a
striking contrast to the general wreckage of the boom-
stricken city. It didn’t join in the madness of the Gillies
days ; it neither bought huge estates to cut up nor built
rows and rows of unsaleable shoddy houses, nor tried to
get the biggest mass of deposits on record ; in fact it stuck
closely to its own little business and let the boom rave past
unnoticed. As a result it has paid its liabilities as they
came due, has reduced its deposits from £llB,OOO (in 1890)
to £15,000 because it found the deposit business dangerous
and unprofitable, has all its assets unencumbered, a solid
cash balance instead of the usual overdraft, its capital in-
tact, and, after reducing the rate of interest charged to
borrowers, it shows a profit of * 1917 for the year. The
profit is a good deal less than last year, when it reached
£3046, and there is no immediate prospect of a dividend,
seeing that there is a heavy drain to be met in the shape
of losses on realisation of foreclosed properties. Still, the
Langridge keeps well ahead of all liabilities, which says a
lot for the management.
* * * *
The Australian Alliance Assurance Co. (Melb.),
a large concern which does fires marine and guarantee
business, and also has a small and steadily-decaying life
assurance connection, reports that the year’s profit is
£19,978 against only about £lO,OOO last year. A 12 per
cent, dividend absorbs £15,000 ; and £4OOO goes to
suspense account. This co. has about £540,000 of invest-
ments, and among them are £275,000 of Victorian
mortgages, £69,000 of Victorian freehold property, which
is a rather dubious item these times, £24,000 in Victorian
building societies (most Victorian building societies are
pretty cronk at present), and over £32,000 in “ Austra-
lasian insurance company shares.” The premium income
of the life department has gone down in five years from
£31,000 to £20,000, and its investments now yield about
£3 18s. 4d. per cent., whereas it is alleged that the society
bases its estimates on a 4 per cent, limit. Also, the ex-
penses of the life branch keep going up as the premiums
and interest go down, and the insurance fund is also
gradually fading away, so the chances are that the
Alliance will presently give up life business altogether.
The sort of life business it does isn’t worth keeping.

The annual meeting of the Bank of New Zea-
land was held last week at Wellington (M.L.), and some
information then supplied throws a little more light on
the last year’s balance-sheet (commented on in The Bul-
letin of 18th July), and makes it look rather better and a
good deal more definite than it formerly did. The net
profit on the year’s business was £96,201, but of this
about £40,000 was set aside to provide for further losses
left over from the old, reckless days of private manage-
ment, and the net profit was returned as being £52,192.
The Colonial Treasurer, however, insisted on writing off
a further £12,000 against known or possible losses, so the
net profit was reduced to £40,083. This was evidently
after payment of 4 per cent, on the £2,000,000 of State,
guaranteed capital. A dividend of 3) per cent, on
£500,000 of preference capital belonging to the State ab-
sorbed £4375, and £35,708 was paid over to the B.N.Z.
Estates Co. to reduce the shortage on that luckless off-
shoot of the bank. Therefore, so far as appears from the
cabled figures, the 8.N.Z., as the result of a year’s work,
met all the interest charges on its £2,500,000 of preference
capital, wiped off £56,000 of its own old bad debts, and
provided £35,708 towards the deficit of the Estates Co.,
which, in such times as these, is a good enough result to
satisfy anybody. There is a long uphill struggle ahead
before the* shortage in the Estates Co., which the old
private management left behind it, is fully met, and the
£75,000 for the goodwill of the Colonial Bank is w'ritten
off ; still, at the present rate of progress these things cer-
tainly will be done in course of time, and the B.N.Z. even
now is in a vastly better position than half of the Aus-
tralian banks.
* * * *
At the Royal Bank’s half-yearly meeting,
held last week in Melbourne, the chairman again
lamented that the Companies Act hadn't passed,
and therefore the institution couldn’t write its losses
off capital. Then a shareholder (moved probably by
The Bulletin’s suggestion that the deficit should
be put openly to profit-and-loss account, so that the
people interested could know how they stood) began
to make inquiries, and was told that “ it was inadvisable
and impossible to state the losses,” and “ it would not be
prudent or wise to fix any amount.” Which is a brilliant
piece of logic. The Royal is willing, as soon as the new
Act passes, to write off losses, and says it would have
done so long ago if the Act had passed. It must state the
amount when it writes them off, yet it says it isn’t pru-
dent to state the amount. Also, it must know the amount
to write them off, yet it says it doesn’t know the amount.
Also, it doesn't know the amount w ell enough to state it
now, yet it knew it so well a year or more ago that it
would have w'ritten it off then but for lack of the neces-
sary authority.

The Eagle Tobacco Co. (Sydney), which hasn’t
paid a dividend for such a long time that this paper for-
gets the date of the last one, announces that the last half-
year’s business panned out for a loss of £726. Previous half-
year it was £754. Before that The Bulletin forgets what
it was. Shares (13s. paid up) worth about 3s. 9d. North
Shore Steam Ferry Co. pays a dividend at the rate of 10
per cent, per annum, and has £674 to carry forward.

The big South British Insurance Co. (Maori-
land) has evidently struck a hard year. Premium income
for the 12 months just ended was £223,477 ; losses and
expeilses, £225,085 ; loss, £l6OB. Interest on investments
and other items yielded sufficient to leave £7990 to the
good on the year’s work, but as the 15 per cent, dividend
absorbs 19694 and £430 goes on depreciation, the co. ends
the year £2134 worse off.

Colonial Permanent Building and Investment
Society, Melbourne, reports a loss of £823 for the past
year, comparedwithlossof £l5Ol previousyear. Thesociety
is now a few hundred pounds to the bad, and it is
sorrowfully remarked that the assets aren’t likely to fetch
their alleged value. As assets never do fetch their alleged
value in Melbourne now, this seems quite probable.

Melbourne Permanent Building Society shows a
half-year s profit of £BB4 ; and this big reconstructed
institution, which is still tottering under a debenture-
liability of £322,000, and is trying hard to live on i 386,000
worth of foreclosed house property and £56,000 worth of
unsaleable vacant land, begins to look like pulling through.
Debenture-interest was reduced some time ago from 5 to
2) per cent., which makes all the difference. The profit
just equals £1 Bs. per cent, on capital, and, while making
£BB4 on one hand, the society seems to have lost £llOO
out of the contingency fund on the other. Still, it looks
a lot healthier than it did, and its liabilities are being
steadily reduced.

If it is a fact, as stated by Sydney Teleoraph,
that N.S.W. Land-tax assessors are to get £1 Is. per day
and expenses for attending when appeals are under con-
sideration, and if the appeals run to as many thousands
as they seem likely to do, w'hat will the expense of collect-
ing the first year’s tax amount to ? Also, if Reid’s esti-
mate of the amount the tax should yield was based on the
present assessments, how much will the tax yield when
all the disputes are adj usted ?

Still another rise of id. on the 21b. loaf is an-

keep it down, as promised.

Auckland (M.L.) has decided to lease its tram-
way system to a British syndicate for 30 years, the reason
being that the syndicate, which proposes to convert the
trams into an electric service, will “ bring capital into the
country.” Which is just the thing that such a co. won’t
do, and which no such co. ever does. It will bring rails
and wires and electric machinery and new cars into the
country instead of having them manufactured locally, and
then it will take capital out of the country in the shape of
the receipts which will go to pay dividends in Hingland.
The idea that a foreign syndicate which gets a valuable
concession necessarily “ brings money into the country”
is played out.

some more law over this matter—in the form of an action
for damages.

A fortnight’s work at the British concentrating
mill: — Carbonates treated, 2614 tons, producing 687 tons
first grade concentrates (69'4 per cent, lead and 14'50z.
silver), and 227 tons second-grade concentrates (55 per
cent, lead, and 15oz. silver), and 25 tons concentrates
from slimes (63’5 per. cent, lead and Boz. silver); sulphides
treated, 2285 tons, producing 445 tons first-grade concen-
trates (71 percent, lead, 240 z. silver, and 5 per cent, zinc),
41 tons second-grade concentrates (61 per cent, lead,
2002. silver, and 9 per cent zinc), and 22 tons slime con-
centrates (72 per cent, lead, 21oz. silver, and 4'5 per cent,
zinc). To ascertain the quality of the work done, it
would, however, be necessary to know the average assays
of the stuff treated. But, anyhow, these returns are
capital. If the machine has lost much metal,
then the ore is much better than has been generally
thought. So long as thorough good smelting stuff like
this is available, and the B.H. Proprietary Co. can buy it,
the treatment of the dry ores in the latter co.’s mine will
be possible. The operations at the British must now' be
yielding a considerable profit. One would, however, like
to know something more about the slimes. The slime-
concentrates are so limited in quantity and their value in
silver and lead so high, while the zinc concentrates are
brought, down so low, that there is just the danger that
too much of the contained metal is being sacrificed in
order to produce a good smelting material.
What shareholders in B.H. mines have yet to
learn is that there is concentrating and concentrating.
Running- a mill is not like running a smelting furnace.
From the latter you get your bullion and can command a
market. You have, however, to depend upon the more
uncertain smelter for a market for your concentrates.
And you have to produce your concentrates accordingly
—to work it up very fine (that is, reduce the zinc con-
tents to their lowest, at a loss, of course, of some silver)
or to send out a rougher product, for subsequent treat-
ment perhaps in a roasting or reverberatory furnace
before blending and smelting. Thus while the British,
selling its product to a direct smelting Proprietary, fines
dow'n its slimes to 47 tons (from 4899 tons ore), Block 14,
which does a preliminary roasting, produced at about the
same time and sent to its works 342 tons slimes for only
2637 tons ore. All of which goes to show that there never
was so much need for shrewd directors who will attend
constantly to their duties as there is to-day.

The Junction Consolidated, one of the recently-
revived mines, is developing well; and at the Silver Hill
Junction, in the same neighborhood, the starting of anew
winding plant has been made the occasion for resurrecting
a number of old reports setting out measurements and
assays which, in the present day, can only be regarded as
highly satisfactory. No sensationally great things need
be expected from either of these properties, but they
stand among the best of those few “ outside show's” which
are even now capable of paying co-operative parties or
very economically-managed small companies.
.North’s 600 ft. prospects are a little better, but
divs. are still far, far away. The Western lode (if what
they have is the Western lode) is very different indeed
from the lode in the Junction and Junction North.

At B.H. Proprietary mine, writes a Bulletin
correspondent, the contract system is being carried out
to its fullest extent. It used to be a standing joke :
“ Soon the offices will be swept out by contract.” This
prediction has not yet been verified ; but a few days ago
an old and faithful retainer, whose duty it was to keep
the offices (which are commodious) in order, was dis-
charged and a boy put on in his place. The cheese-paring
does not appear to have yet reached the highly-paid
officials.

that arteffort will be made to get men elsewhere who will
be equal to the task. Boys, so-called, who are really

Barrass and Conley’s wonderful show at the
Peak, Cobar, is coming out under the wing of Col. Wad-
dell and ex-Mayor (of Sydney) Manning in the form of a
£200,000 co., in which B. and C. are to get one-half in
paid-up shares and £40,000 cash, and a working capital of
£20,000 is provided. To be offered first, we are told, in
the form of a syndicate of 100 shares of £640 each, to find
the cash and working capital. The Bulletin suggests
that the syndicate first put up £lOOO and spend it in sink-
ing another 100 ft. on the Blue and Brown lodes, and
driving on each 100 ft. from the bottom. That will give a
fair idea of the value and extent of these ore bodies. At
present it is impossible to say what they really are. The
syndicate which bonded the mines now known as the
Cobar Gold Mines, of which the Fort Bourke was the
chief, crushed over 2000 tons from different places before
they paid oVer the purchase money. Tonnage was already
exposed by eight years’ development work, which is not
the case with B. and C.’s mine. If such work was ex-
pedient with the Fort Bourke, how much more so in the
case where the purchase money is over ten times as great ?

The mining manager, W. Blake more, sends a

to prevent the mine turning out 100 tons of copper a
month, and thinks it can be landed in Sydney for 130 a
ton. The only reason he can give for the failure of the
mine in the past is the fact that no machinery existed for
treating the ore before it went to the smelters (by which
it would seem it was sent direct to the furnaces’instead
of being first concentrated) and that it is unsuitable for
direct treatment.
* * * *
Whispered that the tributors working the Cobar
copper-mine are now netting something like £l5OO a week.
Well, they deserve it. What the men who worked the
mine a few years ago deserve is quite another matter.
They never got anything for gold contents, even if they
knew it was there. The tributors are getting about
2500 z. of gold a week. Wonder if the London copper-
buyers would find it out if the tributors were innocent of
its presence. Also, if the million’s worth of copper sold
in former years was all used up with its gold unextracted?
The Bulletin smiles.

Again the Dayspring mine, at Parkes, N.S.W.,
has been thrown on the hands of the syndicate that
bonded it early last year with the idea of floating.
Beyond much doubt, the mine would pay were £lO,OOO
spent in plant and development for an output of 1000
tons monthly.
* * * *
The Cobar Gold Mines Co., N.S.W., evidently
means business. Contract let for the excavation of one
dam to hold 18 million gallons, which will probably cost
more than is spent on the average Cobar mine altogether.

Birthday mine, Parkes, N.S.W. : “ The stone is
showing nice gold, and we have a large quantity of pay-
able stone in sight.” How much, 100 tons or 10,000?

Broken Hill Ore Reco very : “ Have brought ore

From a W.A. mining-manager who keeps an eye
on the General Gordon mine and its surroundings : “ No
fresh developments in the parent mine, and they are not
too active over the crushing plant which was to be crush-
ing ‘ early in October.’ Glass, the manager, has re-
signed. He is a cold-blooded truth-teller, and has been
acting up to his Ballarat reputation. However, the
mine is head and shoulders above those around it, floated
on its strength. Perhaps the rich lodes and formations
referred to in the prospectuses have also been stolen.
They are not visible there now to ordinary eyes.”
Pambula— “ Mining is very quiet here ; severa 1
mines are under offer for sale, thus retarding- develop-
ment.” Never work a mine while under offer (a well-
observed W.A. practice) seems to be the game all over
N.S. W. Nine-tenths of the alleged mines of N.S.W. are
either under offer or have been undey offer and are ready
to go again. Why are so few Charters Towers, Bendigo,
or Ballarat mines under offer? Because they are all
worked byco’s? Nothing of the kind. Good mines are
seldom for sale.

J.P.-W. to The Bulletin: —“A new broom
sweeps clean.” N.S.W. Mines-Minister Smith, shortly
after last general election, crowed loudly about his inten-
tion to squelch “ shepherding,” the ruination of the
mining industry of the province. Probably the boss
shepherder of N.S.W. is a fat man who makes a southern
field his chief stamping-ground. This gentleman must
have at least a score of leases taken up in his own name —
and more about to be granted—upon the greater number
of which no labor-conditions whatever have been fulfilled.
One case in point. A windlass and rope have been hold-
ing 40 acres for five years ; five men were at one time
working there for five weeks when the rope and windlass
were erected. These facts are notorious in the town and
district, yet nothing is done. If you wish to try your
hick with any of these locked areas, the price asked is
something tall. Can nothing be done to compel this one
fat-man to disgorge and allow the town he keeps in chains
to timve on ?

Bayley’s Consols : “Reef 2ft. to 3ft. wide, and
the stone carries a little line gold.” Have they stopped
working the water? As a water-mine it has been a great
success, but as a white quartz mine the outlook is gloomy.
Bavley, the finder of the Reward mine, W.A.,
died iast week on his estate in Vic., aged 31. Had he
never found that mine, the chances are he would have
lived another quarter century, while Westralia might
possibly still be living on pearl-shell, sandal-wood, and
jarrah, and a lot of other things would never have
happened. Heaven knows how long the Reward mine
would have remained unfound in such a desert and
desolate country. There was only one of its kind there,
anyhow. Now that he is dead, the writer expects a
revival of the yarn that he never found it at all—as big a
lie as was ever told. Success killed him, like many a
better miner, but, be it said to his memory that the big
turn he gave to Westralian history was not all the result
of easy luck. He and Ford (his mate) went into the wilds
of tile country and suffered tremendous hardships.
* * * *
T. Hewitson, who elected to boss the Ivanhoe
at Hannan’s, in preference to the Cobar Gold-mines, gives
some big figures of the estimated tonnage and value of
the ore in sight in that mine. The totals are 47,775 tons
containing 132,826 \4 0z - gold. He adds—“ With a suitable
water supply there would be no difficulty in keeping a 60-
bead mill fully employed. '’ Alas, where is that suitable
water-supply to come from ?
♦ * * *
By wire—“ A meeting of the Coolgardie Man-
agers’ Association will be held shortly to discuss the
advisableness of sending ore for treatment to the Water
Trust and Public Crushing Co.’s works, near Northam,
where 80 head of stamps of the Californian type have
been erected, besides modern appliances for saving gold.
The water for the works is unlimited in quantity, and well
suited for crushing.” To keep this plant running will
require over 1000 tons a week. Where are the mines near
Coolgardie that can do it? Some excuse for failure will
soon be found. Carriage too long, or crushing charges
too high. Coolgardie has too many idle batteries of its
own lying around to attempt to keep one going over 300
miles away.

Big Blow—a well-named Coolgardie show, re-
port sent to London—“ Nothing new to report; water is

The. Golden Leases M. Co. prospectus—“ Unlike
many other mining properties the water difficulty does
not appear to exist.” A similar yarn appears in nine-
tenths of the Westralian prospectuses. Where is there a
mi ne on the Coolgardie fields that has no water difficulty ?
Plenty of water in places, but densely salt.

gross value at current market rates being, in round
figures, £lBO,OOO. The estimate as to the value of the ore
is based upon the mine assays.”

J, A. Wallace, Vic., suggests Govt, rewards for
treating quartz tailings at a cost of 2s. 6d. a ton for a 94
per cent, extraction, and for treating complex ores at 7s.
6d. a ton. What he suggests for quartz mining he is doing
himself in alluvial. Wallace, at Yackandandah, Vic., has
spent fully £40,000 in building barges and placing all
the machinery on them necessary to break down
and raise thousands of yards of ground daily. The fact
that he has just completed two new ones at a cost of
£14,000 is evidence that the business pays: Wallace pub-
lishes no returns. The bulk of the wash consists of old
alluvial tailings, but as long as threepence in gold can be
got out of a cubic yard it pays Wallace on account of the
gigantic scale on which the wash is handled. What he is
doing there can be done in other places. In a few weeks
a start will be made to use the same system in N.S.W.,
and, better still, on a piece of ground Over a mile in
extent which has not been turned over, and is paying
handsomely now, though worked on the old paddock and
tip-dray system.

Maitland (N.S.W.) has run a Chinese
mission for seven years past with the aid of a cheap
Chow missionary who gets <£3o a year. The name
of the toiler in the vineyard is KumYee, and in
seven years he has presumably drawn <£2lo. As a
result he reports that, “on one or two hearts the
truth seems to be taking hold ”■—it hasn’t en-
tirely taken hold of anybody yet. There are
about 300 Chinese in the district, and, at this rate of
progress, it will take 1050 years and <£31,500 cash
before the truth seems to be taking hold of the
whole lot of them, and by that time they will pro-
bably be dead—most of them, anyhow. There
was a deficit of Is. 9d. in the year’s work (income,
<£29 18s. 3d. ; salary of toiler in the vineyard, £3O),
and a collection was taken up to fill the gap, but
the stolidly indifferent Mongol only panned out for
10gd. No le3s than thirty females get their names
enthusiastically mentioned in the local paper over
this matter, so it seems to pan out well in the
matter of advt. Thirty female enthusiasts ! .£3O a

The absolute want of humour in the

smileless organisation Mrs. Patterson was ap-
“'TWERE BETTER FAR WE NE'ER HAD MET!”
pointed to promote “ peace and arbitration ” for
the ensuing year, and considering the dreadful
way Abdul Hamid is going on, and the row in
Madagascar, and the Matabele trouble, and the
awful hunger to annex the remains of Africa, and
the war in the Soudan, and other things, Mrs.
Patterson should have her hands full. The fact
that Miss Smith wasn’t appointed to superintend
the drought, and Mrs. Jenkins to attend to the
department of planets, comets, and fixed stars,
and Mrs. Thingumbob to look after the devil
generally, was probably an omission which will be
remedied next year.

plaintiff’s hired service. Plaintiff was a J.P. and
squatter, and two neighboring J’sP., also squat-

Dear Bulletin, —Coming from the West,
the other day, a Salvation Army “ staff captain ”
was my only companion in a first-class railway-

his fine silk travelling-coat and cap, and when
nearing a very cold spot late at night envied him
his soft fur rug. At every refreshment-station
he filled himself with beef-tea, toast, cocoa, cake,
and other luxuries. He didn’t whisper any “ Hal-
lelujah-tack ” into my unregenerated ear, but was
busy reading Corelli’s “Sorrows of Satan ” while
I was thinking of his poor, half-starved sister
officers in the back-blox. —R.H.

he would probably have followed the example of
the Westralian station-master who advised Jerry

alcohol than best Dunedin ale. A similar lesson
was taught by a Sydney “ ginger-wine ” prosecu-

The recent attempted escape of a prisoner
from Darlinghurst Prison, Sydney, and the admis-
sion that he had secreted lock-picking and bar-

new methods adopted in Continental and Ameri-
can gaols for coping with such criminals. There,
bars in window, doors, and elsewhere are mere
hollow pipes and are filled with water. When a
pipe is severed the water escapes, and this escape
at once registers itself in the gaol office. This
system has, so far, defied the wit of gaol-
breakers.

Telegram-faking is a queer artj but some-

while the opposition rag attributed the saying to
Dr. Kayser, of the Foreign and Colonial Bureau.
Only lately one of the rivals gave as a special:
“?he Honorable: Dr William Connor
Magee, Bishop of Peterborough, is dangerously
ill.” While the other fellow read it: “Peter-
borough Cathedral, which has long been con-
sidered unsafe, has been condemned as dangerous.”
And the London wire, “Victoria critical,” was
variously interpreted to mean the failing health

For the last two weeks there has been an
armed peace between the Adelaide Hospital fac-

offered to arbitrate—an offer that was accepted,
but, so far, without result. The striking doctors
refuse to go back with the imported Dr. Napier,
and Kingston very properly declines to sacrifice
the man who stepped into the breach when the
patients were practically deserted.

The Northern Territory has the very small-

that of Maoriland. Yet its birth-rate is so exceed-
ingly small that the population is dying out. For
every 1000 people there are six births, eight deaths
and one marriage per annum. The Territory,
unless something happens to it, will soon be
known as the land of the aged, unmarried China-
man. For that matter, no judicious infant would
choose that region as a place to be born in, and it
says a lot for the Australian infant that he so very
seldom is born there.

that the gentleman reflected on was present.
Nothing was done in consequence. On the last
occasion Mr. Angus and his troubles were men-
tioned in the presbytery, ministers were asked to
entertain a proposition that they should subscribe
£6O to set him up in a suburban news-agency. Ihe
fine d’splay of scorn with which the project was
greeted was edifying to witness.

Judge Williams, of Victoria, has taken to
making severe remarks about the Crimes Act,
which makes the seduction of a girl under 16
penal, no matter what the circumstances may be.
The present law practically assumes three things :
(1) That no girl 15 years and 364 days old, or a
little less, ever lies about her age or invites seduc-
tion, though a girl 16 years and one day old may
do both ; (2) that though a girl under 16 isn’t
responsible for her actions in this respect a boy
under 16 is ; (3) that no girl under 16 ever perjures
herself in the witness-box, and her statements
there can, to all intents and purposes, be implicitly
relied upon. And all these three things are an
ass and a Social Gimlet, and there is no sense in
them.

C. R. : “Is French the only language in
which a thing can be put neatly ? Plain Saxon is,
if you know how to use it properly, not so bank-
rupt in this potentiality. Speaking at a Church
meeting in Melb., the other day, a lady remarked
that the social instinct —as exemplified in Bands
of Hope, Sons and Daughters of Zion, &c.—might
be described as ‘ a love of togetherness.’ Quite so.
Bet your blushes!—‘a love of the altogether-
ness ? ’ ”

A M.L. prohibition-district J.P. had the
other day only just time to flee by the back-door
of a sly-grog saloon when the police burst in the
front. Next day he sat on the Bench, armed with
all the terrors of the law, read the saloon-keeper a
severe homily, and fined him <£l 4s. Calling in
the afternoon for his usual nip, he was received
with a volley of blasphemy that made the glasses
rattle. “Steady!” said the magistrate, “I’ll
toss you up which of us pays the fine.” The
landlord won ; and half-an-hour later the J.P.
thus addressed the court-clerk: “I find that
owing to a slight misapprehension Blank’s fine is
much heavier than the law requires, and after due
consideration 1 have decided that a fine of 10s.
will meet the requirements of the case. You will
please make the necessary alteration and—here is
the money.”

‘ln Vic. Assembly, the other day, attention*
was called to the case of one constable. Pigott,
who rescued two women from a burning building
and suffered considerably in the attempt. Some-
body wanted to know whether the department
intended to recognise the constable’s bravery by
promotion or otherwise. Chief Sec. Peacock
replied that the Commissioner of Police had made
a “ suitable entry ” in the record of the scorched
hero, and he would be allowed full pay whilst in-
capacitated from duty.—
PUGS,—PAST AND PRESENT.
At last Maitland municipal election a can-
didate was tiring the crowd with bungled-up
statistics. One of the audience : “ Where/do you
get them there calkerlations frum?” '“Why,”
replied the would-be alderman, “ why, I get them
from —from Grog—Groglan’s strychnine-istics. ”

A case which recently arose in
Melbourne leaves room for a good
deal of moral discussion. Two
young men burgled a clothier’s
premises and took 113 coats.
The clothier advertised that
if they were returned he
would pay a reward of £5
and let the matter drop.
Thereupon the coats were
laboriously humped back
to the tailor-man’s house,
and, while he was counting
them to see that they were
all right, a member of his
family, seemingly by pre-
arrangement, bolted for
the police. Two constables
promptly arrived, and the
thieves ran for their lives,
minus the =£s and the 113
coats, having almost bent
themselves double carrying
the goods back to no pur-
pose. The tailor, so far as
appears, considers that his
conduct was justifiable on
straight business principles,
whereas the two men are
understood to regard him as
a low, deceptive character,
and the public don’t exactly
know what view to take.

The other Sunday in
a Victorian church lovely
woman asserted herself quite
unexpectedly by rising up
in the choir and aiming her
hymn-book at a fellow-wor-
shipper. Being a woman,
she naturally hit the wrong worshipper, and
the person who received the unlooked-for volume
on the ear stood up and said things, and the ser
mon stopped suddenly. Then the culprit stated
hysterically that the young man whose eye she had
attempted to blacken habitually made faces at her,
and after that some friends led her out in a highly
nervous state and with her bonnet considerably
dishevelled. This sort of thing does a good deal
to brighten up the tabernacle, which otherwise
has a tendency to be dull and rather heavy.

The Road to Ruin—cheap beer and cheap
adultery.
Spagnoletti : “ Australia has sundry indus-
trious dealers in artificial teeth. Like diamonds
in necklaces, they are knocked out and reset. It
doesn’t pay to bury new teeth in view of the large
supply yielded by corpses nowadays ; and not one
woman in three has her own. The astonishing
cheapness of dentists’ sets proves much.”

Apropos the Victorian case wherein the
court hesitated to admit as solicitors young men
who had served in the province’s militia : a now-
practising N.S.W. attorney, when he presented
himself, found that he was in a tight place.
Devoted to music, he had added to his small in-
come by occasionally playing in an orchestra, and
shared the pay with the pros.’ This was, it seems,
known to one member of the court, who, more
than half angry, asked, with more acerbity than
usual, if the applicant for admission hadn’t earned
money outside the law lately. The applicant
came near owning up to the orchestra work, and
would have spoilt himself thereby; when Chief
Justice Martin hastily interposed : “ Why do you
hesitate? Didn’t the applicant accept pay as a
private soldier in the Soudan ? ” “Oh, yes, yes,
yes, your Honor.” And so the old C. j. saved
him, to the dismay and disgust of at least one
learned brother.

From Sydney D.T. :
T ADY would like to Exchange Ideas (epistolary)
1A with someone of literary tastes. Sojourner, G.P.O.
Is “Sojourner ” a new name for the “pore’’widow
who usually advertises for some kind elderly gent
to lend her £3 ?
If a “ bobby,” whilst on duty,
Should cheerfully contrive
To rescue screaming beauty
From getting burnt alive,
He has the satisfaction
When he’s carried home to bed
(Unless he falls in action,
And is altogether dead)
Of knowing that his wages
Are not docked when he’s away,
Since the Government engages
To allow Full Pay.
He may not be promoted—
For a rise he didn’t 100k —
But the incident is noted
In a big official book.
His conduct is recorded,
So, after passing hence,
Perhaps he is rewarded
By a ruling Providence.
And meantime (as was stated)
In the ’Ouse the other day)
Though incapacitated
He receives Full Pay.

W.S.W. : Verse too didactic; people get plenty
of moral lessons in prose R.R. : Academic rhymes
lacking- force Von K. : Neatly done, but rather
mechanical. Will consider L.M.D. : Wants a little
more humor and a little less elaboration S.C. : Pathos
doesn’t begin anywhere, and it has no middle, and the end
is lost W.L.: Thanks; but we printed “Identity”
some years ago. Also, it is by Aldrich, not by Stedman,
as possibly you knew In Advance : Worthless
Sydney Doctor : There is humor in the fact that the re-
volting doctors have seemingly not the moral courage or
the literary capacity to put their case against the lodges
before the public, but leave the job to a medical book-
seller ; but surely you overstate the case when you say
that doctors generally hate their lodge-patients, and con-
sciously neglect their duty in regard to them ?
L’Homme Qui Rit : Can’t make anything out of it
X. : The civil servant who takes outside work presents a
tough problem. If he doesn’t neglect his proper duty,
and doesn’t undercut wages, he has a right to do as he
likes with his spare time ; and some of him earn such a
small salary that you can’t decently ask him to stay con-
tent with it. You must decide every case on its
own merits O.E.D. : Will read for next week
J.M.P. : No room for surprise at a man ostentatious in
his religious professions attaching himself to several
women at a time W. : Melb. Club, not Melb.
Cup, accounted for him losing his money James
B. : A band of Chinese carol-singers under the unhappy
subject’s window would form the only appropriate vehicle
of publication for that poetical address C.J.C.: Fun is
like Hooligan’s left foot—which would have been a beau-
tiful thing if it hadn’t wanted the whole of the road to
itself H.C. (W.A.) : Considering J.S., jun. : Fair
points ; want much briefer handling R.W.: Ballad
long enough for a bicycle-track—four laps to the mile
M.H. (Melb.): Passable album-verse ; not force or distinc-
tion enough for print Boomerang: Thanks D.8.G.:
Verse not quite force enough ; prose has one gleam—the
buzz-fly’s attitude to mankind W.P. : No snap, bite,
flip, sparkle. Consider the barmaids how they pull, and
put a head on your beer Wanda: Too mixed
Bunyip : Perhaps one V.K. : “ Whalers” flat; and get
away from conventional aspects Mamoose: Rondeau
no force or originality E.K. : Sonnet flat Omar:
The triolet only looks easy Tobul: A humorless racing
bard is a shocking spectacle J.G.T.H.: Drawing im-
possible Whipcord : A catalogue isn’t a poem
Robin: Can’t use “Two Men”; and please don’t chop
your yarns into little bits like that A.M.H. : Nice
rhymes ; but the thought doesn’t half fill them J. A.R.:
Too rough for print Waihi: Report of Footseray “ in-
sulting behaviour” case noted. The Salvationists evi-
dently disgraced themselves and their professions, and
the constable was justified in summoning them ; yet as a
rule it might be discreeter to take no notice Cedric:
Thanks, but this uaper has no obscure cols., and no odd
inches to fill up....7.H.D.8. : Good material, but you want
the faculty of dramatic presentment Jay : He hypno-
tises her to his rooms at midnight, and she comes without
her body, which is so inconvenient that something snaps
inside him and “ Victor Mortimer, with his soul steeped
in sin, goes to answer to his God for the evil that he
wrought with the power that was given him.” Let us
pray Robin: “Meted” has strong points, but you
don’t get them out X.Y.Z.: See Mr. C. A. Laurence,
solicitor (Messrs. Laurence and M'Lachlan), Sydney,
about the matter Bogong : The Bulletin cannot pre-
tend to decide between the respective stories of Slocum
and Slater J. Cansey : How can N.S.W. grow jute to
compete against Indian coolie labor ? A. : Like the
average careful housewife, you regard summer sunshine
as an accursed thing, which brings flies into the dining-
room and takes the color out of the carpet L.L. : As
The Bulletin said years ago, on a similar occasion, the
love of freedom is man’s noblest instinct, and it was dis-
graceful to lash a prisoner who (without using violence)
had tried to escape from gaol. What are gaols and gaolers
for '! Isn’t it the latter’s business to see that prisoners
have no chance to escape? Cecil Ray: No value
Cobbler : Thanks ; have sent it to Mr. Becke Noodles:
You seem to be only one noodle, but the vastness of you
is so apparent that this paper enthusiastically endorses
your inspiration in making yourself plural Tinkle:
“Cranky” old theme conventionally treated; . t’other a
potato of point in an acre of tedium Colonial: Point
too deeply embedded in verbiage J.M.W. : Unreal
imagination—and other things Whiteye : Nothing in
it as told T.D. : She did quite right to throw you over.
It would be Sheol to marry a poet like that J.L.R.:
The anaemic little poem has just crawled painfully past.
R. : Captain stole schooner, mate killed captain,
Chinaman bullied mate, reef wrecked schooner, sea
swallowed everything. No poverty of invention about
you, anyway Robin: “Recipe” pretty tedious
A Chip: Looks like a dull paraphrase of Lucretius
G.F.D. : Possibly; but a bit late J.J.R. : Give it to
the local paper. We never grudge the local paper little
things like that Tom C.: It’s truth, but it isn’t litera-
ture W.J.H. : Wants short, humorous telling; yours is
long and dull. . .Ne’er-do-well: More “ blanky.” There is no
present demand for “ blanky” either... Prof. M.: What is it
supposed to be all about ? D.M. (Shepparton) : You
seem to have struck a pretty large thought which isn’t
of any present value Susan (Werribee) : Your moral
seemingly is that two people marry, and neither proves
what the other expected, and no one knows any way of
making things different W.C. : “ Boxer” not good
S. Stephens : An unnecessary whoop. The “Harmy” can’t
bear being described all over again at this late hour
J.M.T. : The Bulletin admires Seddon, but not your
poetry about him. It is a dreadful thing to work hard
and honestly for your country, and then have your
friends sling odes at you Jake’s Will: Perfectly harm-
less little tale-and-water. Rejected for the same reason
that Kipling’s devil wouldn’t take in Tomlinson R.S.
(Melbourne) : The bushman’s lonely grave again in its
most aggravating form Jaka : Phelim O’Fane at Bally-
raggan is off our bate Ole Bull: Will use J.C.T.:
The old, old style of stolen-cow yarn Pisces (Perth):
You claim that Yic. produces more gold than Westralia,
not because it is a better goldfield, but because it
is older. Then the old, worn-out, exhausted gold-
field is better by reason of its age than the new one with
its treasures intact Subscriber (Norseman, W.A.):
Can’t advise what doctor to go to. But the doctor not to
go to in almost every case is the advertising medico. If
you were in the East we could recommend you to a
specialist Yanac : “ Committed suicide by calling Bill
a liar.” Very old American joke W.G. (Nundle): Yes.
R.C.T. : Handed to artist. Memo, posted J. M‘V.
(P.) : Good D.F.G. : Do we understand you to say that
sketch and letterpress are stolen, or that the letterpress
only is stolen ? The gist of the letterpress, we now know,
15 years ago went the rounds of the American press ; but
we still believe the sketch to be entirely original. In
fact, the legend was handed to the artist without any
picture at all.

WILLIAM FLEMIKTG-,
24 CLARENCE STREET, SYDNEY.
A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, Nov. 3, 1896.
My Dear Myee—
The “ enthusiasm of the London critics ” over
Hilda Spong as the Duchess of Coolgardie boils
down, upon close inspection, into Clement
Scott’s rather unaccountable “ tremendous notice”
and mildly-encouraging pars, from most of the
others. Still, considering the freezing contempt
the ’Ome potentates have for anything new, as a
rule, Hilda’s beginning is quite triumphant.
When Henrietta Watson, a far more finished
artist, appeared at Toole’s last year after an
absence, the critics patted her on the back patron-
izingly with, “ And who, you will ask, is Miss
11. W. ?” English playgoers are very short-
memoried, for the above query was about a girl
who had not been out of the running for more
than a few years : they are also extremely groovy,
and if they once like an actress will go on fancy-
ing her in girlish parts long after she is a grand-
mother, and indignantly crush the irreverent
stranger who may dare to observe that Ellen
Terry is rather an elderly Beatrice or that Ada
Rehan’s figure is a trifle matronly. If Hilda
Spong only “ catches on ” while she is still young,
she will be a great draw to playgoers who like
t hair heroines to look convincingly youthful and
charming.
Ethel Haydon and the new duchess of Drury
I jane were school-fellows for some time in Brighton
( Vic.), where Ethel was much the quicker of the
two. But Hilda was always much in earnest, and
especially so when she began on the stage. She
often used to say that she looked upon acting as a
thing to be taken seriously. And she improved
much as she went on. Perhaps her best character
was the sketch of Mrs. Cleeve which she con-
tributed to “Mrs. Ebbsmith.”
A preliminary meeting was held on Wednesday,
28th Oct., under the auspices of Lady Hampden,
to start a local branch of the “ Mothers’ Union,”
an organisation which is, by its own showing, a
paradox in action, and a fatuous, flabby paradox at
that. The first object is “To uphold the sanctity
of marriage.” Now, Mothers already United (to
fathers) have all the Union they want, and Mothers
not previously United (to anybody) would be
hooted out of the Union. So cui 'bono? Inci-
dentally, any Mother requiring the information
will be prayerfully taught the best way of setting
a good example to her boys and girls ; but if a
woman hasn’t sense enough to know how often to
spank her own little Tommy for the good of his
soul, she’s not the sort who can extract much in-
struction out of one hour’s talk per week with old
ladies of both sexes. There are branches of this
humorless organisation in many places, and a
muster-roll of 100,000, which is no more convincing
than the same number of names would be at the
foot of a petition. Some people will sign any-
thing, or join any society, provided it is hail-
marked by names giving due weight of religion
and aristocracy. And why not a “Fathers’ Con-
federacy ” or a “ Solidarity of First Cousins twice
removed ? ”
Philanthropy is always blighted by too much
Bible-class. Charitable institutions of all sorts
are run on the Sunday-school basis—as if
men and women could be walloped into good
behaviour like naughty children. A dipso-
maniac can’t be restored to health with-
out being given his daily stimulant of infan-
tile hymns accompanied by harmonium drone.
The dipsomaniac is frequently a man of strong
mental calibre, an invalid whose over-acute sensi-
bility makes him a neuropath, and he naturally
feels an amused contempt for the dull, nerveless
Sunday-school level of intellect. Goody-goody
folk can’t even give the factory-girls a banquet
and dance without throwing in a church service,
setting apart special seats at the feast for the girls
who are privileged to have their impressions of
Jonah and the whale guaranteed by an Hon.
Flowers were handed up lavishly on Saturday
night at all the concerts and theatres. Local
florists must have been doing a roaring trade all
day. A thoughtful admirer at the Centenary Hall
handed Miss Isaacs a yellow cluster exactly match-
ing her satin gown ; and Miss Blanche Thomas,
in pale green, carried off a bunch of pink roses
much enhanced by the contrast. Miss N. Young
was in a paler shade of green—the two tints struck
a cold chill when the wearers sang a duet —and
she staggered under a huge basket of flowers.
Then some extra trophies were distributed to the
men : the only one who got no bunch was Herr
Vollrnar, and he seemed quite lonely. .
Dr. MTlroy’s burglar is the victim of science.
The doc.’s wife, hearing a noise in the middle of
the night, cautiously whispered her husband that
there was a man in the room. Turning up a
convenient gas-jet, the doctor suddenly sprang out
of bed and grasped the intruder, while the lady
rang up the police on the telephone. A bobby
rapidly wheeled himself to the spot on his bicycle
—the modern version of the onward relentless
rush of Destiny-—and the burglar was captured.
The only unsupplied long-felt want now is a
Rontgen apparatus to detect the man under the
bed without his knowing it.
A fairly representative d.c. assembled at the
Lyceum first-night to see the fair Cora B. Potter
flop to conquer—for it was much more than a
stoop. But she was, when she forebore to curtsey,
a refined and fascinating Kate Hardeastle, and
her gowns were Potteresque—which means that
they suited that lady of curves and angles in her
own characteristic way. Her first appearance was
in dust-colored silk, with overdress of green taffeta
made with tabs at the waist and long direetoire
tails, lace about the neck and a wide belt and sash
ends of black satin; her handkerchief was of
grass-lawn, a point worthy of note, as that is the
latest fashion in colored pocket-handkerchiefs;
though, methinks, very awkward if one has a cold
in the head. She also carried a large black hat
with plume nodding over her nose. So it was no
wonder that young Marlow didn’t recognise her
when he saw ber again. The barm aid-dress was a
weird and wonderful arrangement of variegated
hues, but, cap and all, it suited her amazingly.
Lynda Maymond, as Constance Neville, wore a
rather monotonous “ Dolly Varden ” of rose bro-
cade in one scene, and an expressive hat of black
and pink.
Knee-breeches and silk stockings comedy needs
a large quantity of artificially-fatted calf for its
support. But Bellew’s Romeo legs are famous, so,
of course, his Marlow extremities were all right in
silvery grey satin touched with a little old lace
and in buckled shoon. Montgomery as Hastings
had a gaudy sort of travelling coat in bilious
satin with capes of purple velvet and froggings
of gold, but none of them filled their last-century
clothes like J. F. Cathcart, who wore a fuli-
bottomed wig and buckram-lined coat as if he had
been born in them.
Saturday, opening day of the N.S. W. League of
Wheelmen’s Summer Carnival, proved so cool that
winter garments were resuscitated, and the smell
of moth-brick was loud in the air. The gayest
colours were seen on the riders’ jackets. M‘Donell,
winner of the long race, wheeled round in parrot-
like array, and the boys whistled “ Pretty Joey ”
as he passed.
Mr. A. H. Fullwood, the well-known Sydney
artist, was last week married to Miss Clyda B.
Newman, eldest daughter of Mr. J. Hubert New-
man, of Woollahra.
There was a soul-satisfying air of solid wealth
about the Hebrew concert at the Centenary Hall,
York-street, on Saturday evening last. Thither
the tribes went up in fairly large numbers and
most expensive apparel. Many diamonds were
flashing about in the hall and oh the platform.
Perhaps the snappiest costume was worn by a
Judge’s wife—a duet in black brocade and pink
pleated silk muslin. All the composers and per-
formers were Jewish, including Cowan, Sullivan,
Brack and Mendelssohn. Among the performers
Miss Nellie Young, Mr. Hallewelland HerrStaell
did a turn at the Trebelli concert as well. Mr.
Sydney Moss accompanied, Herr Vollmar con-
ducted, and Miss Kahn, a clever pianist, quar-
relled with her instrument violently in several flats
in a Liszt rapsody.
A pretty and quiet wedding—for a change I
should like to see a “ hideous and vociferous ”
hitching—happened at St. Stephen’s, Willoughby,
on Wednesday of last week, when Miss F. A.
Lamb, daughter of Mr. J. de V. Lamb, was
married to Mr. J. L. Newall, who comes from
England and has taken his bride there per P. and
O. A “ quiet ” ceremony means that the bride
didn’t adorn herself in white satin with yards of
encumbering train. On this occasion Miss Lamb
was sensibly clad in the dress she afterwards de-
parted in, and so saved the guests from under-
going the blank of that “great gap of time ” when
the bride is changing her attire and they have
nothing to do but stand awkwardly around with
handfuls of rice ready to hurl among the tulle and
roses of the bride’s best hat.
The pretty little kiosk lately built near the Art
Gallery had a deluge of a christening on Friday
afternoon, and the opening, for which Mrs. Green-
law and Mrs. Pechey had sent out invitations,
fizzled out. They have taken the tea-rooms on
contract to supply hot and thirsty lovers of art
with refreshments, and a more exquisite landscape
than anything they will find inside the Gallery is
the view of “ our beautiful ’arbor” from the veran-
dah of the kiosk, a dainty structure like a house
out of a new box of toys.
“ Can Australian women cook?” is the conun-
drum awaiting answer just now, and a shuddering
“ No ” is wailed in answer over a whole dyspeptic
continent. Our cooks, though sometimes worthy,
lack variety, have naught of genius, and to-day we
dine as yesterday and many yesterdays. We have
the plain, solid facts of beef and mutton hurled at
us daily, either roast or thinly disguised in hash ;
we lack the imagination to plan a subtle entree or
a pudding that isn’Qfarinaceous. With acres upon
acres of waste land suffering to be used as poultry-
farms we are forced to regard chickens as luxuries,
and when we do seize on some old bird (hatched
most likely at Guvmentouse in Lord Aug. Loftus’
days) and slay him for the table, we crudely bake
him, and haven’t sense enough to mitigate his
muscular development in a stew as do even the
Spaniards, and they are considered the worst
cooks in the world. Worse than that, we fry
chops and serve them up with a floury viscid
gravy. We can even evolve gravy round bacon
and eggs ! In fact, there is no culinary crime that
an Australian backblocks cook isn’t capable of.
Town girls are better. The suburban daughter of
a comfortably-off professional man can usually
turnout a neat little dinner. But she has a fatal
fondness for jam sandwich, and “angel,” “rib-
bon,” and “ rainbow ” cake and other like cakes
easily faked with cochineal and desiccated cocoa-
nut. And only think how we deflect in coffee !
The prevalent craze has struck an eminent sur-
geon’s wife, who begged her husband to get her a
bicycle. “My dear,” he replied, “I am already
making artificial noses for three scorchers.”
There is, I read, at last hope for the bald. At
the London oxygen-treatment hospital, established
by Baroness Burdett-Coutts for the treatment of
ulcers and “incurable” sores, by enclosing the
afflicted part in an air-tight chamber and pump-
ing in half oxygen and half air, it was noticed
that the growth of the hair round the wound was
increased considerably. A rubber cap was fitted

The hospital has been a great success, though doubt
is expressed as to the permanency of its cures.
My Melb. correspondent writes: —
“ Saturday’s Derby made a record on its own
account as regards coolness. No horse has annexed
the blue ribbon on a more icy day. T® an almost
frozen assemblage, Newhaven, panting and sweat-
ing after his win, seemed the oniy warm thing at
Flemington. ‘ The wind which blows between
the worlds ’ had apparently been laid on for the
occasion, and it empurpled women’s cheeks and
noses, tore at silken skirts, revealing dainty lin-
ings, and disclosed to the curious the fact that the
Melb. girl still delights in ’Murkan foot-wear with
long, attenuated points—-carefully stuffed with
cotton wool at the toe-caps to preserve the sym-
metry.
“ As a dress-parade the Derby is taking the rank
once held by the ‘Great Tuesday.’ Hard times
are teaching Vic. women economy ; and as in a
Cup-day crowd high-priced garments are noted
but little and suffer much from the unavoidable
crushing, the finest raiment is now kept for either
of the two Saturdays. Most of the gowns were of
such airy, flimsy material as to be inconveniently
light in a tropical summer. The many medicos
present must have noted with grim satisfaction
their business going up by leaps and bounds; a
packet of mustard-leaves in the drawing-room
would have been hailed as a seasonable addition
to the toilet-tables. But the south wind wasn’t
responsible for all the red noses present. The buffet
was thronged throughout the day by damsels
demanding ardent liquors to keep out the cold, and
one short-skirted maiden was generously helping a
party of half a dozen girls, all sweet sixteen or so,
to something out of a square black bottle.
“ The Govt. House party all shrouded them-
selves beneath vast unoeautiful wraps. Lady
Idina Brassey, who generally manages to go one
better than anyone else in the matter of guyful
garments, sported a purple pelisse of unique and
astounding ugliness. Lady Brassey’s gown of
Derby-blue silk had skilfully-arranged front and
shoulder flaps of White chiffon, and she wore an
irrelevant-looking little toque of pink roses on
brown straw. Mrs. Freeman-Thomas came out
from under her wrap during the afternoon, and
disclosed a dainty gown of grass lawn over white
silk. Lady Hampden and Lady Magheramorne,
the two best-looking occupants of the vice-regal
pen, were habited in black. Daughter Dorothy
froze gently all day in a white-and-black muslin.
Melbourne’s *"est-dressed girl ’ wore her brother’s
ulster most of the day, and a pink nose and a flam-
boyant waistcoat were the distinguishing charac-
teristics of the Melb. beauty.
“ The wedding of Miss Ethel Rosenthal to Mr.
bydney Phillips, at South Yarra last Wednesday,
was celebrated in an unusually picturesque fashion.
The binding together was done in the quaint,
chapel-like ball-room of “Rhianva,” but the rest
of the affair was entirely al fresco. The wedding-
feast was spread on tete-a-tete tables on the
flower-bordered lawn. The rattling of plates and
glasses was drowned by the music of a brazen
band which hurled, inappropriately enough, the
most cynical portions of the “Faust” music at
the assembled feasters. The bridal pair left for a
Maoriland honeymoon, after which they take up
housekeeping in Sydney.
“ A steady stream of Melb. sassiety girls seems
to have set in ‘on the road to Mandalay.’ Miss
Maud Dudgeon, the other day married in Me'lb.
to Lieut. Manser, should certainly not feel lonely
on arriving, for three Vic. girls are already married
and settled in that nigger-infested city—a daughter
of Col. Bull, governor of Pentridge prison, and
the sisters Connelly, late of Bendigo. The place
where there ain't no ten commandments ’ seems
to possess particular attractions for the Vic.
sassiety beauty.”
W e never mention him now,’ is evidently the
rule in a certain vice-regal mansion since the
escapade of one of its lordlings. At a recent
function an innocent old professor inquired of the
private sec., within the hearing of a score, where
Lord was to-night?’ The sec. hastened to
tell his nearest companion some obviously forced
and irrelevant information, and left the where-
abouts of his colleague a mystery. But most of
them could guess.
“ Since Duncan Gillies left us, his old home
in East Melbourne has been broken up
owing to the death of the elderly lady whose
paying guest he had been for 40 years.
M.L.A. Zox is another such Koh-i-noor, from
a boardinghouse-keeper’s point of view. He has
occupied his present apartments since the child-
hood of his landlady’s pretty daughters, by whom
he has come to be regarded as a beneficent adopted
uncle.
“Talking of mushroom titles: Melb. sassiety
regularly gnashes its teeth at Gov. Brassey
because he ajjparently cannot discriminate be-
tween local blue-bloods and State school-teachers
and such like. In bitterness of heart they dub the
brusque baron ‘ democrat,’ and describe him as a
yesterday.jump-up. 5 Really, to hear them talk,
one would imagine that until the Sunbeam skip-
per picked up a nugget a week or two back he had
habitually scratched his head, chawed raw onions,
and spelled cat with a k.
Meanwhile, the suspected Radical in vice-
regal clothing goes his own goatish way—bikes off
to breakfast with retired haberdashers, and at
theatres shuns the Governor’s enclosure and elbows
his way through the crowd to a side-box, thus
cutting the preliminary “ God Save ” out of the
programme. Malcontents put everything down
to ‘ meanness. ’ They credit the offender with a
European reputation for economy, and ascribe his
fondness for the company of gilded drapers to
pelf-worship.
“ Gov. Brassey has thrown up his experimental
farm in W.A. in disgust because the authorities
over there were chary with their concessions.
Ambitious Melb. parents who meant to send their
boys to His Excellency’s manager as farming-
pupils express themselves as “bitterly disap-
pointed in Sir John Forrest ”!
“ The pet charity of the moment is the Cottage
by the Sea—a resort for convalescent children.
Many subscribers grudge the outlay on furnishing
and decoration, which is finer than youngster
relish, while the building is too small to hold more
than a few inmates. The matron of a similar in-
stitution habitually insisted (and perhaps does
still) on keeping the little convalescents indoors all
Sunday for Sunday-school, church, &c. A fort-
night was the limit of each child’s stay, and two
whole days of fresh air was a big percentage to
lose, but nothing would induce the autocrat to
hear charges their hymns on the beach. Econ-
omic management is the fad of yet another estab-
lishment. The needy parents of a two-year-o'd
with tuberculosis of the hip, got their invalid
admitted with much difficulty, and hoped great
things from the sea-air. But the child looked
little better at the end of her fourteen days—and
small wonder, for, as an attendant formally com-
plained to her father, she had screamed for an
hour every morning because she did not get sumu
with the porridge which constituted her break-
fast.
Yours affectionately,

A QUESTION FOR THE GODS.
I’m a very small soshul pertater,
And I don’t take a nab when 1 go
To the Princess’s amphi-theater
For a commonplace bobsworth of show;
But there’s no admiration more willin’
Than mine for the classes Perlite,
So, of course, I expended a shillin’
On Rupertswood Battery Night,
And I found it a glorious sight—
I did—
A ’appy and glorious sight.
After waitin’ from twenty parst seven,
1 mannidged to get a good seat
With the gords (it was really like ’Eaven),
Where a cove could enjoy the elect.
Well, I leaves yer to guess my emoshun
When the band played a nashernal air
And a thrill of h’instinctive devotion
Informed me their Nibses was there,
I laid myself out for a stare,
I did-
A ’orty serciety stare.
The “ Chinatown ” Company acted
A drarmer that seemed rather sorft,
Whilst the nobs in the circle distracted
The thorts of us cherubs alorft;
I paid very little attenshun
To things wot occurred on the boards,
Havin’ come with the simple intenshun
Of sniffin’ at ladies and lords.
Thinks I—“ Wot a chance this affords !
My word !
This the charnce of a lifetime affords.”
The part o’ the prograrme I studied
(Except when I glanced at the stage)
Was a cast of performers blue-blooded,
Whose names ’ad been starred in the Age.
All them mummers I wished at the devil,
For they seemed to be trying to foil
My attempt to discover Lord Nevill
And fair Lydy Emily Boyle—
’Er ’ands isn’t ’ardened by toil.
You bet!
She don’t earn ’er livin’ by toil.
I can’t take my h’oath, not for certin’
But I’m pretty well sure, all the same,
That before it was time for the curtin’
I knew ev’ry noble by name.
Still there’s one thing I couldn’t discover
(No more can my bloomin’ old gurl,
Who’s as wise as they make ’em, Lord love ’er f
Though she don’t put ’er ’air into curl) —
Is “ House Party ” a dook or a earl,
D’yer know,
A Orstralian dook or a earl ?

Dear Bulletin, — Be the mystery of Julian
Thomas’s birthplace. I heard him say several
times that his father was a Virginian, and that he
was born on the Janies River in Virginia which,
perhaps, accounts for his once taking the name of
Sydney James. Of his mother he never spoke.
He was at school in America, and ran away when
twelve years old, was brought back, and ran away
again a year later and joined a famous slaver
captain whose name I forget. He made several
voyages, and on the last was left on the Guinea
coast through his ship being chased by an English
cruiser; thence he made his way overland and
coastwise to the Gape; then to England, where
he seems to have had a good time, as he spoke of
owning a schooner-yacht. Two years ago he said
definitely that his age was 63. He also mentioned
that he owned 500 or 600 acres of land on the
James River which was valueless on account of
arrears of the land-tax, which he commended.—

H.Ex. patiently waiting while the local Bom-
bastes clears his throat preparatory to mouthing
the “ address ” in eulogy of Her Gracious, her

ginal—washed, combed and generally titivated for
the occasion—and with the thirst for what the
white pfeller’s tchillin would prooure him—
silently edges alongside Her Majesty’s representa-
tive, tugs at his coat-tail, and softly, oh, so softly,
whispers in his ear : “You give it pfive tchillin,
Mr. Gubnor.” Mr. Gubnor imperiously brushes
away poor Jacky; but, unabashed, the sable
warrior returns and again softly whispers: “ Him
nudder white pyfeller tell it me you gib it pfive
tchilin ; only pfive tchillin, Mr. Gubnor ! ” plead-
ingly. Here they haul the deluded blackfellow off
without his having received even the proverbial
“ Gillies browney.” And now the greeting from
the black man to the white man is : “ What you
make it me fool fo’? You tell it me him blenty
good pfeller ! What for (disgustedly) you white
pfeller hab it nudder plurry mean pfeller for Gub-
ment man for ? ”
An American tells The Bulletin that
many years ago, ere Pastor Bevan came to minis-
ter in the leading Melb. Congregational church,
he was given the pastorate of the wealthiest
Presbyterian congregation in New York city —the
“ brick ” church on the corner of Thirty-eighth-st.
and Fifth-avenue, at a salary of 10,000dol. per
annum and a palatial manse. The rev. gentleman,
however, “ queered his pitch ” on his first Sun-
day. The church was crammed to hear the new
Boanerges from across the pond, and shortly after
he had begun preaching a lady rose and marched
out —possibly overcome by the heat. Dr. Bevan
stopped short, and remarked that as soon as “that
woman ” had ceased disturbing the congregation
he would proceed. “That woman’’proved to be
a member of a very high-toned Knickerbocker
family, and the poor pastor’s unfortunate slip
brought quite a hornet’s nest about his ears.
Several of the leading papers alluded to the
occurrence, and no doubt the unhappy contre-
temps was a potent factor in his speedy return to
England. In America you mustn’t call even the
char-lady a “ woman.”
Joseph Bosisto’s ex-
periments in the manu-
facture of wattle-blossom
perfume have resulted in
failure thus far. As a
commercial product the
new essence is very little
superior to wattle-blos-
som poetry.

“ Australian literary talent has no show in
Australia unless it has the hall-mark of London
approval,” says Louis Beoke. Melbourne Leader,
commenting, says : “ This conclusion coming from
Mr. Becke savours of ingratitude.” On this point
it is wise for papers like the Leader to be dumb.
Throughout the couple of years or so during
which Becke’s stories, the ones that made him
famous, were running in The Bulletin, and
whilst the Leader was filling up with the humor
of the immortal Bowsers —made in America,—
neither the weekly Syme nor any other solid,
respectable organ of its class discovered the
slightest merit in him, or dared to hint that his
work was deserving of a second thought. The
same remark applies to other Bulletin men who
have scored in England.

Becke and Jef-
fery’s “First Fleet
Family " is thought
more of in England
than Becke’s “By Reef
and Palm ” and “ Eb-
bing of the Tide.”
’Cause why—it talks
of Hingland’s great-
ness. It is regarded as
an essentially propel
book for this alone.
Just for the same
reason do the London
papers (bar the demo-
cratic Daily Chboni-
ole) barrack for the
release of Buccaneer
Jim and his comrades,
“because,” they say,
“he and his officers
are not fitted to stand
the rigors of imprison-
ment ; and were actu-
ated by the desire to
maintain our national
prestige. By the way,
one of Becke’s stories
(originally published
in The Bulletin) en-
titled “The Cook of
the Spree too Santo — a
Study in Beach-
combers” which ap-
peared in “ The Eb-
bing of the Tide,” was
spoken of by one of the
London newspapers aa
“a story especially
suited to the radical-
minded readers of the
journal which has in-
flicted him on English
readers;” yet the
“ Ebbing of the Tide ”
is in every library in
England, and women
“ go for it,” a London
librarian says, on ac-
count of “ the immoral
suggestiveness of some
of the tales.” Mrs.
Meynell says that Aus-
tralian literature is
“ de-oi vilised ”and
now some hard-minded
Essex farmer’s wife
wants to know through
the press why Mrs.
Meynell advocates
French dishes for Eng-
lish bucolics? Possi-
bly the farmer’s wife thinks that French cookery
means danger to the morals of the British farmer.
Jimmy Mirams, he of the Premier Per-
manent Society and the historio gamp, now runs a

pears a big advt. of a book by Jimmy himself, en-
titled “ Victoria’s Depression amd its Cure. ” Con-
sidering how much Mirams’s building society did
to bring about the depression, he ought to know
something about the subject. The Mirams insti-
tution, which was about the first to go bung and
which hasn’t yet paid a dividend, is the most de-
pressed thing in Victoria these times.
Mr. R. Jeffery is essentially a champion
shot on the rifle range : he has never pointed gun
or rifle in the sporting field, nor drawn trigger on
anything but the bull’s-eye of the target. His
shooting experience even at that has been com-
paratively little and intermittent. An English-
man, he began at the age of 16 by joining the
Isle of Wight Rifle Volunteers, and for some four
years with them he had casual and amateurish
practice. When 21 years old he came to Queens-
land, but throughout six years did not fire one
shot. Then he joined the Q. volunteer rifles, and
put in his Saturday afternoons at Toowong range
—the worst in Australia, sinoe the sun setting
slap on the targets would almost dazzle an eagle’s
eye. In ’9l there, Mr. Jeffery obtained his first
win—a second place in the Queen’s competition.
He returned to England then and won nothing,
came back to Brisbane, went to Melbourne, prac-
tised with the rifle club there; came to Sydney
six months ago, and practised with the Sydney
Rifle Club the last three months. He familiarised
himself with the Rand wick range’s light effects,
studied its peculiarities of hillocks and gullies, learnt
the moods and ways of its wind-currents. And
when the competition came he beat everybody,
Australian or other. He won the Jaques prize
with 65 points out of 70, the Manning with
67, and the Dangar with 64. His target
in the Dangar 900yds. was a pioture ; five bull’s-
eyes and two centres —33 out of 35. The perfec-
tion of this shooting, with _ the Bisley foresight
and orthoptic disc thrown in, is all the more re-
markable beoause Mr. Jeffery, shooting in a twi-
light which was quickly fading into darknesß,
wound up with three bull’s-eyes. His winnings
for the meeting total <£111; the evergreen Sergt.
Keating comes next with .£7O. Mr. Jeffery is a
moderate drinker and regular smoker, but during
competition-time abandons both glass and pipe;
“ they unsteady the nerves, and smoking also dulls
the eyesight.” He thinks the merit of Aus. rifle-
shooting is rising. He is 34 years old, and by
avocation a jobbing-compositor. He has light-
brown eyes, and remarks that light eyes are gener-
ally understood to shoot best.

“A REMARKABLE PHENOMENON.”
“A telegram received yesterday by the N.S.W. Government Astronomer, from Coonabarabran, reports the occurrence of a remarkable phenomenon. A loud rumbling sound was heard from below the surface, which appeared to travel in a south-easterly direction. The farmers working in the
fields were much alarmed at the inexplicable sound, doubtless fearing a disturbance of the earth’s surface.” —Daily PAPER.
“ That rumbling sound” has been heard pretty generally throughout N.S.W. since the Land-tax assessments were sent out, and there has been a very decided “disturbance of the earth's surface.” “But,” says the man with the eyeglass, in the distance, “people
will get accustomed to it in time, and think nothing of it!”

GEO. H. BENNETT, M.P.,
Tells you to use Warner’s Safe Cure.
One of Melbourne’s foremost citizens and well-
known business men, Geo. H. Bennett, M.P., in
a letter Oct. 5,1895, says : “A friend of mine ad-
vised me to try Warner’s Safe Cure for the liver.
I did so, and I feel sure that if many people who
are suffering from liver complaint only knew how
easily they could be cured by Warner’s Safe Cure,
they would not delay in obtaining it.”
If your liver is perfectly sound ; if you are
never giddy, never have a sour stomach, with
flatulency, a bitter, oily taste in the mouth on
rising ; if you never suffer pains in the side or under
shoulder-blades; if you always sleep well during
the night and are never drowsy during the day;
if you do not see specks before the eyes, nor suffer
nervous excitability ; if you never have sick head-
aches, or are not troubled with occasional sickness,
the above testimonial will not interest you. If
you suffer from any of the above symptoms, why
should you hesitate one moment longer to employ
this remedy, knowing it is a positive cure ? You

POLITICAL
POINTS
Waddell, M.P., is apparently Premier
Reid’s skirmishing man, on off-chance of any
vacancy occurring in the N.S.W. Govt.
There is some difference of opinion in S.A.
legal circles as to whether women can sit in Par-
liament, but the leading authorities say “no.”
N.S.W. Cabinet meeting. Premier Reid :
“Brother Garrard will open with the usual
petition to the Throne of Grace.” Jack Want:
“ Hold hard. Let’s get off this Gup sweep.”
Yat. : “ Premier Turner might have a shy
at attempting to introduce the Gothenburg
system. No politician has so thoroughly the con-
fidence of the trade, par excellence. And most of
them burn to clear out. ”
An Adelaide politician having oracularly
remarked that “ the boy is the father of the man,”
a New Woman indignantly wrote to the press
urging that such a shocking state of affairs should
be immediately stopped !
Attorney-Gen. Isaacs scored a big point in
the Vie. Assembly last Thursday night by reading
a leading article from the Argus of 1850, in which
One-man-one-vote was advocated in the most
vigorous terms. The Opposition sq uirmed visibly.
The N.S.W. Govt, was desperately anxious
to get out the land-tax assessment notices before
25th October, so that the 60 days’ grace might ex-
pire before the Xmas holidays, and allow the tax-
payers to forget, in the Xmas festivities, the bitter
piU.
Perkins, M.L.C., defending Bananaland
Council against the Assembly: “What do they
want? Do they want only a recording clerk?
. . If the heavens were to fall I insist we do
not surrender any of our rights, tvhatcver they are.
Possibly we do not know what they are,” etc., etc.
Could the arrogance and ignorance of the average
Leg. Councillor be more succinctly summarised ?
M‘Kinleyism :
“A protective
policy which pro-
tects, coupled with
areei proci ty which
reciprocates.”
The Reid Go-
vernment a little
while ago, after 18
months continu-
ous inquiry in Par-
liament, issued a
very ugly-looking
list of the civil
Bervice appoint-
ments it had made
during its term of
office. Now it has
evidently thought
better of it, and
it issues an amend-
ed list, with a lot
of the appoint-
ments that ap-
peared in the pre-
vious document
omitted. One
State paper, how-
ever, that the pub-
lic has waited for
till it has almost
forgotten all about
it, still fails to
turn up. When
G. Reid produced
his famous price-
list of Govern-
ment stores, show-
ing that prices
were twice as high
in Melbourne as
in Sydney, and
the figures were
proved to be a
ghastly cram all
through, lie an-
nounced that an
amended state-
ment, revealing
the real position
of affairs, would
be published at
an early date.
That was a good
while ago, but
the country is still
waiting for the
amended state-
ment. The “ bit
of cold iron to
ohew” has drop-
ped out of sight.
The late Parkes is being quoted longer
than was old Jack Eobertson. Few politicians
are quoted after being dead a month.
Prohibitionist Macdonald, M.P. (on the
Sunday liquor-trading question in N.S.W. A»
sembly): “ Short of absolute prohibition, I should
like to see the drink in troughs, so that every man
who wanted to make a beast of himself could do
so.”
Premier G. Reid says that “ the wages of
a labourer in the State of Washington are 1 dollar
36 cents a day, or 4s. 9d.” The said amount really
adds up to ss. Bd., but Jollyandfat, whose figures
are always wrong, probably got as near to it as
he could.
N otice posted on a house at Prahran, Vic.
“ Trespes wil be proded.” The owner of the
“proputty,” who has a large “ stake in the coun-
try,” strongly upholds the Tory “ vote for thrift,
because, as he says, “Hignorant pussons must not
be hallowed to rule hus. ”
Gov. Buxton has offended S. A. politicians
by an injudicious speech delivered at a country
Show dinner against the Absentee-tax now in
force in S.A. It is a curious coincidence that
H.E. spent the previous day as guest of a loca 1
squatter who contemplates a residence in England.
Left-wing Protectionist leader Copeland s
pair of retrograde achievements in N.S.W. Par-
liament last week : On Tuesday he talked out the
Capital Punishment Abolition Bill, and on lhurs-
day he registered himself as one of three who
oijposed the second reading of the Referendum
Bill.
Had N.S.W. ex-Premier Dibbs possessed
Reid’s big majority, what a masterful, rollicking,
high-prancing old time N.S.W. would have bad
He’d have ordered a referendum on his own
whenever he felt like it, ukased a military con-
scription, and built Parkes a marble mausoleum
and given the widow <£looo a year.
N.S.W., beinga Freetrade province, doesn’t
levy a duty on imported coal. But when an
attempt was made recently to bring some Vic-
torian coal to Albury, it was smothered by a
railway charge of 2s. 6d. per ton for the four miles
or so between Wodonga and that city. It wasn t
a customs duty of 2s. 6d. per ton, but it got there
just the same.
In re the Aliens Exclusion Bill before
NSW. Parliament, difficulties are being raised
as to the “color-line.” One authority suggests
that, instead of a rule of complexion, there should
be tests by “ the hair, or the shape of the skull,
as being more scientifically ethnological. vVhy
not rule that the being whose foot-soles are not
paler than his insteps shall be a colored person:
In cases of wooden-legged men, the palms of the
hands v. the backs ?
POLITICS IN MAORILAND.
MALE CANVASSER: “Have you decided how you are going to vote?"
LADY ELECTOR : “Oh, yes! I'm going to vote in my Trilby hat and my new
merino frock with astrachan trimmings.”
S.M. Herald reports Premier Reid as
having declared that the Referendum Bill is “ the
first proposal of the kind made in a British-
speaking Parliament.” The British language?
Sample of it: “ Pogue an arran huich usquebaugh
I dunno, but somewhere about the firmament;
salaam sahib, wockalongamaloo, bangshwang,
plenty talkee, exactly ” —or words to that effect.
By Gum ! Let us invent an Australian language.
Brisbane Courier logic: “In Victoria
Democratic forces are in power, and Victoria is in
a state of unparalleled depression. In Queens-
land Democratic forces are not in power, and
Queensland is about the most prosperous of the
colonies.” The Courier does not point out that
the depression in Victoria is the direct result of the
very same kind of legislation that is paramount in
Queensland to-day, and that Democratic legisla-
tion is only in its cradle in the former province.
As to attributing Queensland prosperity to the
rule of the Boodlewraith one might as well attri-
bute the Westralian revenue increase to the rule of
the Six Families.
THE TEMPTER'S TIP.
OLD NICK (to anxious punter, undecided whether to go for a
“recovery): “Have a bit on Embezzlement. It’s a SAFE
THING.”
Poor old maundering John M‘lntyre,
leader of the Vic. Tory party, in a recent
oration : “ I tell you this Trades Hall is a very
real and very terrible thing. (Cheers.) They say
it is a bogey. (Cheers.) It is no bogey. It is a
thingwhioh—which —which (cheers) —which creeps
like a—a —a dreadful shadow—and —and—and
(cheers) —and . ”
For 1895 Brisbane is beaten in the matter
of exports both by Townsville and Rockhampton,
the latter coming out half-a-million ahead of the
capital. On the other hand, the imports of Bris-
bane are six times those of Rockhampton, and
four times those of Townsville. A volume on the
need for tripartite autonomy couldn’t say more
than these few figures.
John Haynes, M.P., may fairly claim that,
though he did not carry bis Abolition of Capital
Punishment Bill right on to the statute-book of
N.S.W., he has yet placed on record in its favor
such a pronounced expression of Parliamentary
opinion that any Executive, except an avowedly
hanging one, will feel morally and politically jus-
tified in cheating the gallows.
Speaker Abbott’s proclaimed determination
to preserve the precedents of the Chair in relation
to the appointment of a refreshment-room waiter
harmonises badly with the new precedent created
by himself the other day, whereby he bluffs the
public out of their ancient right to enter the
Strangers’ Gallery of the Assembly without the
intervention of the formal ticket.
A. C. Begg is a candidate for Dunedin city
at next elections. His quality is shown by his
selling his Roslyn tram-shares recently because
the cars were run on Sunday, by his advocacy
of prohibition, and his platform pronouncement
that the workingman had no r’gh: to starve,
because plenty of sheep's heads and plucks were
to be had free at the freezing-works.
The sapient S.M. Herald -
The completeness with which the Premier demonstrated
from his own data the efficacy of the referendum ....
may suggest to many the question how it is that so appar-
ently simple a remedy has never been employed in Eng-
land during her six centuries of Parliamentary institu-
tions ?
Hof course! It hain’t Hinglish. That’s the
reason, too, why the Rontgen rays are a deplor-
able—what?
A Northerner tells The Bulletin that the
Q. Chinese have a trick of posting their “ natural-
isation” papers to friends in China, and thus
enabling the latter to enter Queensland. One
Tingha Chinaman boasted that his papers had
been “home”2o times, and had brought out as
many Chows. “If they must come,” remarks the
correspondent, “why not give them a substitute
paper, and return the original when they clear
out ? ”
A well-informed Maoriland correspon-
dent :
We are now plunged into the electioneering vortex. I
fully expect we shall emerge from it with a big majority
of Liberals, unpledged to Seddon and determined on
having the Referendum, Elective Executive, and perhaps
Hare System of Voting, though the latter is doubtful.
The Cold-tea party will gain no seats. The old Conserva-
tive party is doing a hari-kari “on its own.” Clutha
Tam MacKenzie is retiring to a lucrative billet in London ;
Duthie is sliding out of politics to devote his high talents
to tin-tacks and cash ; Button is giving up the game in
holy disgust (he’s a Christian lawyer and Y.M.C. A social
purity patriarch); J. G. Wilson, a decent squatter,
ashamed of the crew, is going into private life—his wife is
a well-known poetess ; Mitehelson got such a fright over
the Bank enquiry that he also wants to retire, but Eden
folks are pressing him to stay. Of the few who are left,
most stand a fair show of getting licked, including Capt.
Russell and Dr. Nevvman. “ Dismal Bill ” Rolleston is
trying to re-enter politics by the door of a different con-
stituency from that which rejected him three years ago,
but with no hope of success. Our politics will therefore
take a new shape after the elections. Stout, Geo. Hut-
chison, and Bell will probably be the only Conservatives
left in the House.
There are but five
Catholics in S.A. Parlia-
ment. Of these one is
Speaker, one Chief Secre-
tary, and one Lands Minis-
ter, while another is the
best debater in the Labor-
party. The fifth has just
been elected to fill the
vacancy caused by the death
of Lands Minister Gillen,
who also was a R.C.
A Yic. parson writes
to the press in an exasper-
ated tone of voice concern-
ing the “One-man-one-
vote” idea : “ Thus the vote
of a gentleman who owns
thousands, and has the res-
ponsibility of a high social
and hereditary position,
may be wholly nullified—
ten times over, in fact—by
the votes of ten of his
grooms; certainly a posi-
tion lacking both ordinary
common-sense and reason-
able national security.”
That is just what the one-
man-one-vote idea is in-
tended for. The “gentle-
man ” in question is no
bigger than a groom, and
has no more legs or features
or head, and he doesn’t live
any longer, and if he and
the groom both lost their
clothes there would be just
as much dignity in one as
in the other, so the thing
doesn’t look so very aston-
ishing after all. But what
does seem astonishing, when
you look at it carefully, is
that a parson who is paid
by the poor, and who is em-
ployed to show the poor the
road to a heaven where
nobody will have a cent,
and who is supposed to
follow a Redeemer who
was too low down to be
even a groom, should be
allowed to issue such amaz-
ing rot. There is something
surprising in that when any-
one lets the circumstance
soak in.
Mackay planters are moving now to secure
the enactment of a maximum wage of <£2o per
annum for the “free” Kanaka, that individual
to be penalised in case he declines to accept!
Extend this sort of thing to Chows, Japs., and
Hindoos, and Australia as a white man’s country is
doomed. The planters deny that the Kanaka is a
slave. What is the difference in principle between
instituting absolute chattel slavery and enacting
that a man shall not be entitled to receive more
than a certain amount for his work ?
A Queenslander of many years’ standing,
who lately revisited N.S.W. Leg. Assembly after
an absence of over a score of years, compares the
manners and appearances of the present members
favorably with those of the old ones. Members on
the horseshoe bend particularly impressed him.
“ Legislation is taken seriously now,” he says;
“there’s a look of work about the shop which
U3edn’t to be there. Why, I remember playing
‘nap’ at the ‘bend,’ where now all is watchful
alertness to trip Government or Opposition.”
Bismarck’s latest revelation expounds a
beautiful piece of villainy. According to his
story Germany maintained, at one and the same
time, a treaty with Austria and Italy by which
they were to stand or fall together in case of an
attack on any one of the three, and a treaty with
Russia whereby it was pledged not to come to the
rescue of its allies or any one else if Russia was
the assailant. The cable mildly observes that
William of Germany has written to Franz Josef
“ explaining ” the matter. But there isn’t enough
explanation in all the dictionaries of Europe to
cover such a situation.

THE SEVENTH REPORT of the Directors of THE NATIONAL BANK OE
AUSTRALASIA LIMITED.
The Directors beg- to report to the shareholders as follows in connection with the business of the bank for the
naif-year terminating 30th September last

Amounted t 0... ... ... ... ... ... ...£14,850 7 3

The increase to the paid-up capital of the bank has amounted to £52,280 10s. during the half-year, the total now
standing at £1,918,211 9s. 9d.
As intimated in last report, the date of payment of one-fifth of the deferred liabilities of the bank was anticipated
in May last, and, encouraged by the success of that movement, the directors dealt similarly with another like amount
of the"same liabilities in September, thus reducing the amount of the long-dated fixed deposits from £4,906,732 Is. 6d.
to £3,265,633 12s. 6d. during the six months.
One of the auditors appointed by the shareholders at the general meeting in May last having desired to be relieved
of his duties at the September balance, the directors appointed Mr. W. G. Sprigg to act on that occasion in conjunc-
tion with Mr. W. H. Tuckett.
The Ordinary General Meeting will be held on Wednesday, 4th November, at noon, at the head office, Collins-
street, Melbourne.
By order of the Board of Directors.

THE SEVENTH REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
—OF—
THE COLONIAL BANK OE AUSTRALASIA LIMITED,
Presented to the Shareholders at the SEVENTH ORDINARY GENERAL MEETING,
To be held at the Bank, 126 Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, at noon on
THURSDAY, 29th OCTOBER, 1896.
Report.
The Directors beg to submit to the shareholders their Seventh Report, with a Balance-Sheet and Statement of
Profit and Loss for the half-year ended 30th September, duly audited.
After providing for expenses of management, interest accrued on deposits, rebate on bills current, and tax on
note circulation, the net profit, including the balance brought forward from previous half-year, amounted to £5591
14s. 2d., which the Directors recommend to be carried forward to next half-year.
The accounts placed before you disclose an increase in the volume of business, but the profits for the half-year
have been materially affected by the continuous reductions in the rates of interest.
The amendment of the Companies Act, referred to in previous reports, giving power to reduce capital, not having
been passed by Parliament, the capital cannot yet be written down in order to provide for losses.
The Seventh Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders will be held at the Head Office of the Company, 12(1
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, on Thursday, the 29th day of October, 1890, at noon.
By order of the Board,

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The opening event of the V.R.C. meeting pro-
duced a painful display of crude horsemanship. The
boys on Reka and St. David, who made a dead-heat, were
flogging away at their mounts in approved donkey-race
fashion, when one jockey’s whip smote the wrong horse
across the nose. An appeal for “ unintentional interfer-
ence ” was upheld by the stewards. There were but three
competitors in the struggle ; one of them had dropped
out of it long before the finish, and yet the other two,
with the full width of the course at their disposal, got
locked together.
Newhaven’s unique Derby-win was a satire on
the prophets’ general expectation of a good race. Had
the runaway bolted off the course after going a mile,
Resolute would have been reckoned a decisive winner.
Nothing troubled the St. Albans colt with the exception
of Officer and Coil, and they came up to him at the
distance-post only to drop back again, beaten by half a
length or so. It was a matter of Newhaven outpacing
Resolute, who, for his little part, was equal to beating the
other six animals after making all the running from them.
The easy winner and the far-away second, judging from
their unruffled appearance after the Derby, could have
gone further ahead respectively, in a two-mile race. Coil
and The Officer were comparatively “baked.”
Resolute’s near fore-foot is the very dicky one
that needs particular attention. When the shoe was
removed an hour before the Derby, the big colt didn’t
care to press it on the ground, but a light plate made
things comfortable again. He ran, of course, in plates (on
the two front iioofs only), and showed no sign of lameness
after the gallop.
Cup betting this time testified to the book-
makers’ opinion of the older horses. Carnage, a brilliant
Derby winner, started at 12 to 1 for the Cup, and other
pre-eminent youngsters in Strathmore, The Admiral, and
Trident were hackahle at a fair price on their days for the
2-mile handicap, seeing that they had first-class veterans
to run against. This year there was nothing to represent
“class” except Newhaven and perhaps Resolute.
“Everybody knew ” that Newhaven’s running
in the Caulfield Guineas was all wrong, and that he would
win the Derby as he liked. All the same, everybody
allowed the colt to start at 2 to 1 against him in a small
field, and but for his having been an early favorite New-
haven would have gone out at a longer price than 2's.
Strange mistakes the Millers make with their
horses when they come to deal with big events on the
fiat. They reckoned the common-looking Buridook quite
good enough to get a place in the Derby, hut had the
mortification of seeing him tailed off at the end of a mile.
Sydney sports had a bad Derby Day at Flem-
ington, their ill-luck beginning with the disqualification
of Reka in the Trial Stakes.
As far as the present writer could see, the
strangest feature of Broken Hill's performance in the
Hotham Handicap was the outside price that he started
at. If David James and co. really fancier! Broken Hill for
the Cup, why didn’t they hack him heavily for the race on
Saturday, which was a sufficiently long journey to give
the Cup-horse a chance to outstay most of them ?
After all, the most in-and-out horse-racing is
rather more consistent than the performances of bike
champions, barring an honorable exception in the case of
Bilmartin.
Coil is better than Le Var, who beat Resolute
in the Caulfield Cup, nevertheless Resolute beat Coil in
the Derby.
* ♦ * *
Newhaven’s easy win in the Melbourne Cup,
with Bloodshot and The Skipper second and third, has at
least one merit: it i 3 something of a knock to the Ikey
Mo brigade. Newhaven, who led all the way, as in the
Derby, started favorite, and it is rarely that a favorite
scoops the big prize. At the same time, it seems doubtful
if this favorite carried anything like the money that
might have been expected, and it is quite possible
that the Tribes have made a solid profit out
of the Cup, though not the profit they ex-
pected. Anyhow, there was a lot of money on
Resolute, Hopscotch, Marusa, and various other animals
which didn't show anywhere in particular. The second
animal was a 100 to 2 chance, and The Skipper started at
about 100 to 3, and so far as second and third places were
concerned the tipsters were mostly far out. Tiie Bulle-
tin here rises proudly to state that it said Bloodshot
wouldn't win, so its tip had something to recommend it.

The English critics think Daimio “ a big lump of
a horse lacking quality, scarcely looking thoroughbred-
in fact, a good sort of a van horse.” The Eli dish handi-
cappers are evidently determined, however, that he shall
not he in the van in England if they can stop him.

Since the Melb. tote raids the betting shops
have to take extra precautions, and guard against the
visits of the female detectives. Any stranger who enters
a cigar shop to enquire the odds is at once ejected, while
lady punters are politely informed that betting is illegal,
and consequently non-existent. Still business goes on as
before, and the talent sport buggies and diamonds as usual.

Byron Moore this year placed at the disposal of
innumerable Vie. country newspapers a two-column racing
article, by “ Sterling” (the veteran Bradshaw), containing
elaborate “tips” for Melb. Cup and other events at the
V.R.O. spring meeting. Braddy's prediction for the Cup
was “ Satn Cook’s best” —Broken Hill, Sabretache, Duhal-
low, or Marusa.

The interminable Dawson question turned up at
Vic. Rowing Association again last week, when the hack-
boneless body decided by a large majority not to allow
cash-cyciists to compete as amateur-oarsmen. A list of
proscribed professional sports was made out, cycling and
sailing being among them, but ultimately “ His Excel-
lency’s favorite sport ” was deleted. As things stand, a
man may sail yachts for cash prizes without let or hin-
drance, but if, as cyclist Dawson did, he starts in one race
which he loses, he is deemed unfit to associate any longer
with gentlemen amateurs. The majority responsible
for the adoption of this regulation contained few of the
known oarsmen of the province, and was composed prin-
cipally of spindle-shanked harrier boys, who pretend to.
row during summer to keep them in form for their excit-
ing winter recreation.
The decision has had the effect of causing four
of the principal Vic. clubs to announce their intention of
seceding from the association and forming a new body,
whore the cash-cyclist or the cash-anything-else will be re-
cognised as an amateur oarsman while he sticks to trophies
in that particular sport. The principle of a professional
in one sport being a professional in all is utterly illogical,
and the defectionists are bound to knock out the old
association sooner or later, considering the growth of
cycling. In another year or two every man will have a
bike and nearly every young man will race, and the sole
effect of the V.R.A.’s resolution will be to impoverish the
ranks of its own clubs.
Not content with doing its best to kill row-
ing, the harrier crowd is trying to work up dissension in
cycling. A week or two back, the amateur cyclists ap-
proached the (so far) professional Vic. League of Wheel-
men, and, a conference being held, relations were so
cordial that speedy amalgamation seemed certain. The
amateurs would, by such a course, gain everything and
lose nothing. They would participate in the profits of
the League meetings by reason of substantial trophies ;
two races of their class would be placed on each pro-
gramme, and they would share in the immense touring
advantages which the League member possesses over the
ordinary cyclist. But such a close association with the
“ kawmon ” professionals seems to have “ narked ” that
portion of the amateur cyclists who regard the running of
20 miles through mud and rain as the greatest of all
pleasures, and an indignant protest against the Amateur
Association having “ any connection with a professional
body ” has arisen in a weird wail. It is to be hoped, in
their own interests, that the majority of the trophy men
have sufficient sense to pay no attention to the shriek,
and let the shriekers do their worst.

Bilmartin’s disqualification will mean a heavy
loss to him. During the next six weeks the various
cycling meetings contain half-a-dozen championships of
£2O or more apiece which were all Bill’s own, not to men-
tion a score of open handicaps and the big Austral prize
itself. Bill is bound to be near, if not on, scratch in this
event, but when 300 sovs. are waiting at the other end of
two miles there is nothing short of 4cwt. of bricks tied on
his hack wheel that would keep him far off. Besides, the
increased number of entries (178) means that in the final
heat competitors are hound to l>e distributed fairly well
over all the marks, so that the back men will have a fair
chance of being paced up.

A couple of years back, when Australian cycling
was almost a thing unknown in England and America,
the leading wheel journal in each of those countries sub-
mitted to its readers a full-page portrait of “ Mr. R. V.
Sprocket, the Australian speed king,” with accompanying
fulsome letterpress. In due course copies reached this
country. Local cyclists were astounded, for the name of
“speed-king” Sprocket was utterly unknown in cycling
circles here. Ultimately, however, one adventurous youth
discovered the missing monarch on the 320 yard mark in
a two-mile event, where he has been ever since, and is
likely to remain. Who paid for the insertion of that puff
is a mystery.
* ♦ * *
N.S.W. Wheelmen’s League had such good luck
with the weather last Saturday that it gave vent to its
feelings at 3 p.m. by depositing haif-a-cartload of glasses
and bottles under the reporters’ table.
The racing was extremely satisfactory, because
the unexpected happened every time, and because the
accidents were frequent and picturesque. That in the
last race was everything that could he desired. Some
dozen riders in the final sprint suddenly came crash ; the
last of the bunch striking the prostrate bodies of their
fellows, shot high in air as if thrown from a circus spring-
board, and fell ker-slump. Whereupon several under-
takers hopped over the fence, dodged the police, and
rushed forward to leave their cards upon the corpses.
Alas ! machines were mangled, but not even one little
bone was broken.
The unduly-abused Orient Plate could have been
much worse. The race was a carefully planned attempt
to dislodge the ponderous curse that roosts upon the back
of every 25-mile race. But, after all, the curse won. Up
to the 20th lap the struggles for the £1 pacing prizes kept
public interest jogging, but then the Curse began to tell;
it brought down Carpenter, Walne, and MTnnes, and
threw Middleton against the fence, where he lay stunned
with his arm-muscles torn. Later on Davison fell, and
when the distance was but half through only seven out
of 33 starters were crawling round the course. M‘Donell
and Body here got away from the field, and pacing one
another, lap and lap about, took the £1 pacing prizes in
turn. Finally, after lapping the field, they sprinted each
other home for first prize. M'Donell won ; his cut out of
the race was £7l; £5O first prize, and £2l pacing prizes.
Ken Lewis, in his heat of the League Cup, rode
a difficult race with judgment, but in the Orient Plate he
much disappointed his admirers. He made a fatal error
in underrating Body’s lasting powers, and in hanging
back in consequence among the ruck, while M'Donell and
Body inch by inch stole oiff. In the beginning, M‘Donell
wanted Lewis to pace with him lap and lap about, for the
express purpose of slipping away from the field. Lewis,
however, considering that the game was his, preferred
playing a lone hand. It ended by his being lapped by
M'Donell and Body, and being able to only just snatch
the miserable third money (£6) from the game little
M'Coombe.
Davison, the Hillgrove plugger, promises to
never have a sprint. In his heat of the League Cup,
while he builocked his hardest, big-gear Pither caught
him 10yds. just after starting. And although he came
through his field and won, it was only because he plugged
steadily from start to finish.
M‘Coombe, in his heat of the League Cup (half-
mile) sprinted the last 500yds. in fine style, arid won easily
from Chapman. M'Coombe is an improved rider, and,
next to Martin, the most consistent rider upon the track.
His honesty in always racing up to his form will debar him
from ever winning a big prize ; he is not class enough to
run straight and win big money.
Parsons was called up. He started in his League
Cup heat with a lightning sprint—simply jumped the
20yds. that was between him and Kellow’s wheel. When
the bell rang Parsons seemed to have the field at his
mercy, but coming into the straight against the strong
wind he died right away, and couldn’t get placed. The
racing board called on him for an explanation, which was
rather unnecessary, because Parsons must ride to win
every time in order to keep his reputation up. The win-
ner of Parsons’ heat was Percy Hunter, the League’s
secretary.

Boidi and Guiseppe, the Italian cyclists, were
popular with the Adelaide crowd, who were alternately
calling out “Ice-cream!” and asking “Where’s the
monkey?” The average Australian has a fixed idea,
founded on years of agony, that every Italian either sells
ice-cream or grinds an organ.
* * * *
The men who have been road-racing throughout
the winter came out on top at the initial meet of Melb.
cycling season. Road-champion J. Carpenter won the
chief handicap, also the first-class mile. His success in
the last-named event was helped by a piece of over-
smart pacing by little brother George; who got off
lightly with a fine of £1 for his share in the transac-
tion. In a fair-run race Clinton would probably have
won.
The Bulletin stated last season that Ken.
Lewis in proper trim would probably prove the best of the
Australasian riders ; and this season's results, so far, bear
out the opinion. Ken. has a fine turn of speed, but
suffers from asthma, and is, consequently, erratic in his
training.
All the Melbourne training-tracks are now
crowded, and there must be quite twice as many men in
training as there were at the end of last season. There
are the usual batch of promising novices, and one or two
quite out of the common. High gears are much less in
favor amongst the majority, and there will probably be a
further reaction towards 70 to 76 inch.
A further prediction of The Bulletin’s that
75 per cent, of Melbourne riders this season would mount
either American or locally-made machines has been more
than fultilled. Hardly a new English machine is to be
seen on any of the tracks, and there are between 400 and
500 men in training.
* * * *
The Y.R.C. vents its spite on the competing
cyclists by imposing a fine—for it is nothing more—of Is.
on every machine entering the course. As there is no
accommodation provided and the terms of the permissive
occupancy from the Govt, give no power to levy such
blackmail, the charge is utterly indefensible.
* * * *
Sydney Cricket Ground people hope with their
new cycling track, with its world-unique accommodation
and big cash prizes, to make a huge haul out of the
cycling boom. The club argues to itself that big money
will command the riders, the public gods ; that the gods
and the splendid accommodation will command the public
—as for the rest—may not the S.C.G’s hand hold the rope
which shall ring the death-knells of the N.S.W. Wheel-
men’s League and the rival show ground !
* * * *
The American cycle-trade papers predict that
the cycle will have as good an innings next year as this,
that the demand will be as pressing, and prices as high.
The craze still reigns in N.S.W. ; several Sydney agencies
having not a wheel for sale.
* ♦ * *
In the States road-racers have wide-tyred bikes
ridden over the course to leave smooth tracks in which
the racers can make pace. This probably accounts in
part for the fast American road-race times.
* * * *
Is cricket the only clean sport ? Cycling, which
begins to stink all over the earth, seems to be following
football. With the increased money-prizes come straight-
out charges of stiff running, boring, and deliberate
attempts to unseat favorites. At recent S.A. wheel-races,
certain riders were openly declared all over the ground to
be “ stiff,” and remarkably accurate forecasts of several
events were certainly given.

Re the enterprising Yankee cyclist who lately
turned off a mile in lm. 3sec. on a specially-prepared
straightaway track behind a railway train (the last car-
riage being' fitted with an air-shield to protect the rider
from the wind on all sides), the sceptical want to known
whether the “special pacing arrangements” included a
piece of wire from the rear platform to the handle-bar of
the machine ?

.Tack Lyons cannot get going in Adelaide club-
cricket. His two scores, so far, are 27 and 29, and he is
undoubtedly not the “Carbine” Lyons of old. “Aff”
Jarvis, by the way, is in wonderful fettle with the gloves.
A new face in the S. A. eleven this season will probably be
young “ Sammy ” Jones, who has electrified Adelaideans
with his brilliant cricket. He reminds one of the dashing
ex-Sydneyite, Sam. Jones, of older days.

“Denver” Ed. Smith was in luck in getting
Mick Dooley to look after him for his fight with Joe God-
dard, which was fixed for 31st ultimo, for if any man can
tell him Goddard’s moves Mick can. Dooley undoubtedly
beat Goddard in Melbourne, as the latter was down longer
than 10sec. ; but, with Mick’s usual luck, the fight was
not claimed for him, and Goddard was allowed time to
recover.
* * * *
Bicycle-racing, as a sport, is condemned by its
own professors. When they don’t go fast enough to win
it is because they are not properly “paced,” or haven’t
“struck form,” which appears to be something quite dif-
ferent to getting fit in the ordinary athletic sense of the
term. Take the prattle of young Parsons on his somewhat
inglorious return from ’Mu'rka the other day. “If I had
had good pacing I think I would have done very well.
My last appearance was in a match with Jay Eaton, of
three one-mile heats, and three heats of five miles. In
each case he beat me by two out of three heats. The
reason of that, to my mind, was chiefly his superior pace-
making.” A bike-race, on Parsons’ showing, is really
contested by non competitors, the men who profess to
ride against one another being merely the tails of the
comets who are supplying them with pace (otherwise
‘heart,” or pluck) and judgment. Wise pacemakers
make a wisely-run race, weak pacemakers make a slow
disciple, no pacemakers mean a farcical display by two
men who daren’t adopt a bold policy. The sport will die
of ridicule in due course. Bill Beach didn’t want a flying
“ eight ”to lure him along in front of Hanlan. He raced
on his own.

The Austral Cycle Agency will shortly receive
big shipments of the world-famous Humber bicycles direct
from England. The Humher, since its introduction to
Australia, has gained an unequalled reputation for re-
liability, lightness, and speed. Gov. Hampden rides one
of these machines. Also, it was on a Humher racer that
Martin accomplished all his sensational Australian vic-
tories. *

Poor Australia is out in the cold as regards

Cricket in Tasmania. A city club has a patron
—a big landowner who is often good for a subsidy. Said
patron plays for a country club. In a match between
teams representing the clubs referred to, the patron was
given out and duly went to the pavilion. Then, in the
course of half an-hour or so, remorse or something struck
the city team, the umpire admitted he mif/ht have made
a mistake, and the patron was offered, anrl accepted, an-
other innings ! And yet they wonder why cricket and
football don’t flourish in Tasmania.

The next Australian cricket-team which goes to
England should be accompanied by a company of Aus-
tralian vocalists and a company-promoter ; the one to give
a concert, and the other to let loose a few wild cats on the
provincial British public at each town visited by the
team, in the evening after the day’s play. This sugges-
tion is given away j gratis with the present issue of this
up-to-date paper.

“Our advice to Mr. Ranjitsinhji, who was
selected to play for England (says Bombay Champion) is
to stay in England, where he seems to be honored ; for, if
he ever returns to his home, there will not be a single
European cricket club which will grant him the privilege
of membership. ... He is an Indian , and therefore
these sportsmen would keep him at arm’s length.” But
perhaps it’s “ dirty nigger ” only when he can’t play; it
might be “noble Ranjitsinhji” when he’s a great
cricketer. Read Kipling.


The London Cyclist, of July 8, pays a very
high compliment to the Cleveland wheel :—“ We have as
yet seen only one American make of bicycle which can in
any way be said to be at all the equal in construction—
apart from design—of the English productions; and, so
far as we can judge without a trial, it may fairly be termed,
as its makers call it, ‘ America’s best bicycle.’”*

The Urrullgurra (N.S.W.) football club chal-
lenged a Kempsey team to a friendly “ rough-and-
tumble.” But when the Kempsey lads reached the village
with the aboriginal name (30 miles from Kempsey) they
found their opponents playing a cricket-match with the
blacks of that place. And, to their amazement, the
Urrul-&c., boys refused to relinquish their game with the
blacks, and Kempsey went home desperate. The follow-
ing Saturday a cricket-match was arranged between Tar-
rabel and Urrullgurra teams, and again the latter team
disappointed the opposing players—for the second time
preferring a game with their dusky brethren ! Now,
some observers state that white Australians are fast
reverting to the habits and appearance of their aboriginal
compatriots. Is there here a proof of the tendency, a
subtle acknowledgment of kinship ?

refresh me. I tried several reme-
dies and consulted a doctor, with-
out obtaining any relief; finally,
one of my customers recommended
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. It helped me

six bottles I was completely cured,

The match-making record of the world.
The Diamond Match Co., of Barberton, Ohio,
U.S.A., in one day produced 12,356 gross of boxes

each. The 13 machines are automatic, but need
the supervision of 340 workmen. The biggest

cannot anything like equal the output of Barber-
ton’s 340 men and 13 machines.
Purves, Q.C., making a pathetic appeal to

sudden, so to speak.
Be the recent flood at Blenheim (M.L.),
the local War Crt states that “ God in a marvel-
lous manner kept the quarters dry, though they
looked like a house in Venice.” Wherefore the
local scoffers are asking if public-houses at a
similar elevation weren’t dry also, or if it is really
meant that the water stood up in a heap around
the home of the big drum, yet didn’t come in.
And people who are not scoffers want to know if
these wild-eyed individuals really think that the
Ruler of more worlds than there are grains of
dust in this mean little earth was personally
occupied in keeping their floor from getting damp,
and if the Salvationist has any idea of the rela-
tive sizes of things.
“ One of the most unfortunate features of
the Queensland tick-plague,” remarks a Bulletin
travelling correspondent, “ is that within the area
proclaimed infested are some of the best, in fact,
the best herds of the north. For years the Towers
and Townsville have obtained their meat-supply
from a few surrounding stations, and the quality
of meat has been equal perhaps to any in Aus-
tralia. Should the plague touch the well-culled
and highly-bred mob of Herefords, on Lindhurst,
it will make the owner —Barnes, of Casino,
N.S. W.—wriggle and his former partner, Fulford,
weep. For years Fulford made the improvement
of that herd of “ Bailies” his sole thought by day
and the subject of his dream at night, and the re-
sult might well make any man proud. Not far
from Lindhurst lives another cattle-man who is
doubtless on nettles. This is Mytton, of Wondo-
vale, who, for years, has been one of the largest
' suppliers to the Towers and Townsville markets.
Two other Northern men who will doubtless feel
anxious are Edkins, of Mount Cornish (Mutta-
burra), and Thornton, of Tower Hill. These are
two of the most famous stations in Central Queens-
land, both on account of the high quality of the
stock and the history of the early days on the runs.
It was from Mount Cornish that that colossal
cattle-theft of something like a thousand head
took place years ago, and of late years the fame of
the place has spread all over Australia on account
of the hospitality of Mr. Edkins and his hand-
some and charming wife. Thornton, of Tower
Hill, is widely known as one of Queensland’s pre-
mier amateur jockeys. He breeds, trains, and
rides his own horses, and over hurdles has few
superiors anywhere. He is well-known in Sydney
and Melbourne as a crack pigeon-shot and an all-
round good fellow. And such men are to have
ticks ! ”

(about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor. I
gave him a few of your Pills. lam pleased to
inform you that having to pass their camp next

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 18711 was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of
your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

EX-CHAMPION JAMES J
CORBETT.
AN INTERESTING INTERVIEW WITH
THE GREAT PUGILIST.
WHAT HE SAYS OF HIS COMING
FIGHT WITH FITZSIMMONS.
From the St. Louis, Mo., Chronicle.
James J. Corbett’s history as a ring hero will
reach the end of the chapter when his battle with
Bob Fitzsimmons is won and lost, for, as the world
knows, Corbett is matched to tight Fitzsimmons.
Corbett, attired in a frock coat of the period, plug
hat, and shod in patent leathers, sat in his apart-
ments in the Southern Hotel at St. Louis the
other day, and delivered himself of a few opinions
regarding his coming fight.
“I am fully aware that Fitz. will give me the
most scientific battle of my career,” said the cham-
pion to a Chronicle man. “Heis a hard hitter
and cool headed. I saw him fight Dempsey and
posted myself on his style. He is my equal al-
most in height and reach, though after carefully
comparing his method of boxing with mine, I can’t
see where he has any advantage over me, as I am
younger, stronger, and shiftier, hit oftener and
mix my blows more. Fitzsimmons is foxy—he
was cute enough to feign grogginess in several of
his battles, thus throwing his opponents off their
guard. He can’t fool me by working the groggy
dodge. I will take no chances with him, 1 think
I can whip him within fifteen rounds. After my
fight with Fitzsimmons I will devote my entire
attention to my theatrical enterprise and retire
permanently from the prize-ring.”
Corbett is now the picture of health, weighing 214
pounds. “I am bigger, better, and stronger than
ever before,” replied the champion when asked
about his health. “The rheumatic complaint
that held me captive off and on some time ago has
left me completely, and 1 know I am cured of it.
I contracted rheumatism before training for my
fight with Peter Jackson,’’ continued Corbett.
“ How I got it or where I got it is a mystery to
me, but that I had it is a fact that I am not likely
to forget very soon. I suffered a good deal with
rheumatism after that fight. Some days my arms,
wrists, and fingers would be so stiff and swollen
that I could not use them at all. My legs also
pained me, but to a less degree. Then, acain, all
this would leave without any apparent reason, and
I would not be troubled again for weeks. Of course
I doctored for my complaint continuously, but the
attacks seemed to come every few weeks just the
same. A short time after my fight with Jackson I
went east and met and defeated Dominick M‘Caf-
frey, though I was handicapped by rheumatism
in my right leg in my encounter with M'Caffrey.
These periodical attacks of rheumatism affected
me until a few weeks before I began training for
my fight with Mitchell. One day I sat in the
Coleman House, New York. My eye chanced to
cross an advertisement of Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills for Pale People. I had never heard of them
before, and as an experiment purchased a box. I
consumed two boxes, and was pleased with the
results, for the pains began to leave my arms and
legs. After taking four boxes according to direc-
tions, I found myself greatly improved. The
improvement is permanent I am sure, for I
haven’t been troubled with rheumatism since.
Before using the pills the rheumatic attacks re-
turned every month or so, especially if I caught a
cold. When I trained for my fight with Mitchell
in Florida, I suffered from malaria and used the
pill as a tonic with splendid results. I found that
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills were efficacious in build-
ing up the system after a malarial attack.”
The above I attest as entirely correct.

DENTAL ART.
There are, perhaps, few cities in the world where
scientific dentistry has attained to such proficiency
as in Sydney. Anyone interested is invited to
inspect the establishment of Mr. J. I. Marshall,
28 Wynyard Square, Sydney. There, in conve-
nient proximity to the well-appointed waiting-
rooms and surgeries, is a laboratory replete with
all the latest appliances required for supplying
artificial teeth of the highest order of merit. Mr.
Marshall is always pleased to show these speci-
mens of the dental craft to enquirers.

The Friendly Societies are establishing
female branches, and Lady Lamington herself is
enrolled as a female forester. A new horror added
to life will be the female Oddfellow, Orangeman,
or Hibernian—with all the dreadful and inevitable
sequences of club nights and latch-keys.
Miss Ada Cambridge (Mrs. Cross), the
Australian novelist, published a book lately
entitled “A Humble Enterprise.” One of her
English critics describes it as being “extremely
restful ” —as though it were a new kind of water-
bed for invalids or a patent cure for insomnia.
This is. the very nadir of irony.

stetric Nursing,” 92 illustrations, is the best book

Certain- Melbourne G.P.O. people, now in
trouble through disposing of obsolete stamps, seem
to have imagined that the wholesale dealers who
bought the goods were anxious to keep their trans-
I actions* dark. That’s where they made the mis-
i take, apparently. Healers, although ready to
purchase “specimens ” under illicit circumstances
rather than let outsiders pick up the bargains, are
professionally interested in protecting the scarcity,
so to speak; of stamps that ought to be valuable.
Hence the cheerful alacrity of the' principal phila-
telic tradesmen in stating all they know re the
] leakage of obsolete stamps from the place where
| they are officially out of issue.
The Argus, with fine frenzy in its eye.—
“On the.platform of the Melb. Town Hall on
Monday night sat the son of the flag-lieutenant of
the Victory, who hoisted the immortal signal at
Trafalgar. The son of the flag-lieutenant of the
Royal Sovereign, that led the first line of British
ships into the fight of Trafalgar, is also, we under-
stand, a res id nt of this city. And this incident
has its significance,” &c., &c. The Argus will be
further excited at hearing that the captain of the
Bellerophon, who received Napoleon’s sword when
the illustrious fugitive came aboard that vessel
and surrendered himself to Rule Britannia, was
none other than the great-uncle (by marriage, you
know) of an old Bulletin correspondent, who will
gladly accept a public testimonial and a grand
! display of fireworks upon any date the Argus
likes to arrange.

C.M.G. : “Melb. Leader lately published \
two pages of portraits of the operations of local
Salvationists saving souls. Advertising piety is not
a new thing, but this is peculiarly sickening. You
get ‘Capting ’ Brown, and ‘Brigadier ’ Smith, and
‘ Lieut.’Sarah Jenkins artfully posed in the very
act of snatching brands from the burning, said
brands having the impress of the camera-man’s
fingers all over them. Uniformed saints are
shown vvith their best heavenly expressions, piously
pawing ’orrid examples at the prison gates, and
propping up a beastly drunk, more in sorrow than
in anger, whilst the most picturesque lasses form
themselves into taking groups, administering j
righteousness and grub to suffering sinners of their
own sex in the city’s slums. Disgusting this, with
the idea of the faked saint and the faked sinner
photo’d for the'glory of the ‘Loard.’ The photo
‘ process ’ has much to answer for ; through its
agency our papers are littered with the banal mugs
of all sorts and conditions of conceited nobodies,
and with irritating waxwork groups—Lady Tangle- 1
foot’s garden-party, the Mudyille Cycle Club, the
Geebung Harriers— 4 sassiety ’ gossip in picture
form. Every .man wants to inflict his photo upon
his neighbors ; it is the curse of our time that the

The Armenian difficulty is causing much
discussion amongst the Mahommedans in Sydney.
A well-to-do Afghan, the other day, laughed at
.he idea of the Sultan being deposed. “Why,”
ne said, “ the Sultan alone is a match for all
Europe.” But if, by any unforeseen circumstance,
he should be endangered, then he (the speaker)
and every true Mussulman would take up arms.
Before the Sultan, who is Commander of the
Faithful, could be overthrown rivers would run
red, and when finally the infidel triumphed, dark-
ness would come upon the world. For so says the
Koran.

An insolvent grocer, examined before Judge
Moleswortli, asserted that “cutting” in the Melb. trade
was carried on to the extent that a housewife could ob-
tain almost all Tier groceries under Cost by buying one line
at one shop and another at another, as each grocer chose
certain lines to“cut” in. No wonder the trade is rapidly
going into the hands of the “ octopus ” firms, which have
Branches spread over all the suburbs.

An interesting, but fiscally confusing, element
has been emtlQdipd in the latest Q’sland Customs legisla-
tion. The £5 a ton duty on sulphuric acid was favored
by the Govt., but stoutly resisted by the representatives
of gold-mining districts, on the ground that cheap sul-
phuric acid is a necessity on many fields. At this stage a
firm of chemists (Elliott Bros.) interpleaded, alleging that
the great expense they had gone to in erecting a sul-
phuric acid factory in Brisbane would be lost were the
duty'on sulphuric acid struck out. Eventually a com-
promise was agreed to and accepted by Parliament—the
±5 duty will remain Customs law, but Elliott Bros, have
agreed to supply to Q. mines sulphuric acid at the price at
which it could be landed from Sydney if the duty were
abolished. In other words, Protection is the law, but
Queensland miners in this instance enjoy Freetrade.
Others than miners are excluded from the privilege.

Dear Bulletin, — The pranks of the N.S.W.
Income - tax Commissioners lately set out in your
“Wild Cat Column” appear, to a layman, very like
something worse than mere “official impudence.” Per-
haps those important personages would not be offended if
it were pointed out to them that they are running con-
siderable risks. There is a common law misdemeanour
known as “ extortion,” an offence created to protect, in
some measure, the community against the rapacity of
public officials. Extortion, it is said, “consists in any
officer's unlawfully taking, by color of his office, from any
man, any money or thing of value that is not due to him,
or more than is due, or before it is due ” (4 St. Comm.).
The definition certainly does not err for want of compre-
hensiveness. The punishment is fine and imprisonment,
and sometimes forfeiture of the office. If some of the
people victimised by the circulars foolishly sent out by
the Commissioners were to apply to the Supreme Court
for a rule calling on them to show cause why an informa-
tion should, not issue against them for extortion, it might
perhaps bring them to their senses. If the statements
made by your contributor are correct it would seem that
a very fair'argument could be made why such an appli-
cation should succeed. Whether it succeeded or not, it
would certainly have the effect of pointing out to the
Commissioners and all other Govt, officials some of the
half-forgotten liabilities imposed on them by law. —Rus.
Roberts.

A Tas. Leg. Councillor, in a temporary fit of
lucidity, the other day moved that no Judge should be
allowed-to.hold a personal interest in mines and similar
ventures. 'The proposal was met with a storm of disap-
probation. . Amid the chorus of scorn, the only distin-
guishable words were “ interference ” (grunts), “ liberty ”
(more grunts), “subject” (several savage snorts),
“ pshaw ! pooh !” Then a volley of sudden sharp cracks,
and the reporters dodged to avoid the shower of flying
collar-studs.

Cabled that the jumpers of the 400 claims on
Rand goldfield have not only failed to win the mines but
have been very heavily fined. In tlv < the Boers can teach
Australia its business. The Bulletin would go one
better. Jumpers should be regarded as informers. If
they won, they should;be well paid for their work ; the
State should go into possession and the mines be auctioned
for the benefit of the Treasury. But what need of jump-
ing, anyhow ? Why can’t the State in mining, as in every
other business, see that the conditions imposed by itseif
are carried out ’

What a Godsend to back-country diggers would
the jerked beef of old days be ! It contains nearly all the
nourishing properties of the fresh article, and, properly
cooked, is highly toothsome —preferable in every waj r to
the “tinned dog” and other canned perdition on which
the miner lives —or dies. Jerked beef is made by simply
cutting the flesh of fat cattle into sheets, and drying it iii
the sun. It can be turned out cheaply, but should be
worth a lot of money on the Westralian fields. In the
early sixties it was extensively made in Victoria, and
shipments were sent to England. Jerked beef, otherwise
known as tasago and charqui, is a South American notion,
as the buffalo knows to his cost.

Two small seams of good coal have been found
near the surface at Frankston, 27 miles from Melbourne,
and in view of this and other encouraging discoveries the
idea of putting a big duty on imported coal is gaining
ground in Victoria. Melbourne Chamber of Manif
facturers is inclined to favor the idea, on the ground that
the local coal discoveries have delivered it from the tre-
mendous exactions of the old Newcastle “ ring.” Govern-
ment is also favorable, partly because the dutv would
yield a little revenue, partly because the local coal pro-
duction creates railway traffic, and therefore deserves
encouragement, and partly on general principles. The
chief opposition, so far, comes from the steamship com-
panies whose occupation of humping coal from Newcastle
to Port Phillip is seriously menaced.

Somebody writes to inform The Bulletin that
no order can be given to any Victorian woollen mills ex-
cept through the Melb. wholesale houses, which charge 15
per cent, commission. Our horrified informant suggests
that this is a scandalous state of things in a State-pro-
tected industry, but really it is not a circumstance upon
the local hat-ring, as regards commercial iniquity. Retail
orders for cloth must be executed through wholesale
houses in any country. The houses buy the stuff in large
pieces, and supply short lengths to their customers (the
shops), and 15 per cent, is not an extravagant profit, con-
sidering that the houses seem bound to get odd bits left
over, &c. It is the hat-ring which runs the factory in the
first place, and then monopolises the distribution of the
hats (at about 30 per cent, profit) to the retailers, that
represents the dark side of the industry in Victoria. Mel-
bourne shopkeepers talk airily to their customers of
getting hats from the Denton mills. They can’t do it,
however. They have to procure their stocks from the
syndicated wholesale warehousemen who control the
factory.

Dear Bulletin, ; —Let me supplement your re-
cent par. concerning Ramornie Meat Works. The works
paid last season Bs. (id. per 1001 b., dressed weight, for
prime bullocks, and 6s. to 7s. 6d. for cows. Put the
average of a mob of bullocks at 7001 b. ; at this weight the
owner would nett £2 19s. 6d. less 2 per cent, discount for
cash (bills are not given). The firm gets as “ bunce ” the
hides, which in the home market to which they go, may
safely be averaged at 20s. each, tongues (which are
canned and sold at 2s. or 2s. 6d. each), tails, which are
also canned, the web and gut fat, hoofs, horns, hair,
shanks, &c., &c., all of which are utilised and sold. The
meat-extract, which you remark is sold retail at a 600
per cent, profit, should turn the firm in about the same
percentage. The extract maker is supposed to make at
the rate of 81b. of extract on an average per head. This,
at the wholesale price of 6s. per lb., totals £2 Bs. To this
add the price of hide, tongue, tail, and other etceteras,
which may be placed at 61 155., and the total is 64 3s.
Tlun comes the meat; put, we will say, 5001 b. of meat at
3d., £6 55.; this swells the amount, to 1210 Bs., and, besides
all this, there is tallow and bones taken from the carcase.
The expenditure in comparison with this is a mere flea-bite
per head. The chief expenditure is in labor-saving
machinery, which is constantly being introduced. Nearly
all the work is done on the contract system. The
slaughtermen get Is. per head for bullocks, and 9d. for
cows. The boning is another contract. Hide folding
another. Wood-cutting and hauling another and so on.
There is money in meat preserving, and anyone with
capital to invest could not go wrong in venturing, in a
small way for a start, on one of the Northern Rivers—
where cattle can be bought so cheap.—Yours, Bovis.
The ease and facility with which partnerships
in big trading concerns are dissolved nowadays in Aus-
tralia, remarks a Bulletin correspondent, is in marked
contrast to the complications that ensued with similar
proceedings a quarter of a century ago. Then it was a
matter of months of labor and almost endless conferences
between the partners. Now, it may be said to be a matter
of days, hours or minutes. The notification of desired
severance is made, and not in the private offices of the
firms is the knot untied, but in the bank-manager’s
sanctum. The financial magnate pronounces the divorce,
and the retiring partner gets the shoot, at times not very
pleasantly.

The owner of a Riverine station, heavily
mortgaged to on- of the bi<f finance go’s, lately received a
letter from Ins employers to this effect: “The company
would he glad to know what personal property'you have
on ‘Stony-broke’ station, together with full particulars
thereof.’ The squatter, well knowing that his mortgage
wb >sj clauses resembled those of an octopus (joke here)’
embraced all his possessions present and future from the
sheep down to his grandmother’s photo., the mangle he
had promised to buy for his wife, “and also all the pre-
sent and future increase thereof,” replied : “ My' personal
property on the station consists of one pure-bred Alder-
ney cow and two Leghorn cocks and a hen. One of the
cocks is thorough bred, the pedigree of the other is doubt-
ful.” Shortly' afterwards he received another letter
asking whether he had any other property besides that
mentioned. The reply was : “ Since writing you last the
cow has calved, and two eggs have been laid which I
believe belong to me.” The mortgagees have now entered
into their kingdom.

The transmutation of silver into gold is the
little thing troubling: five metallurgical chemists in
America, arid if one of their number (Dr. S. H. Emmens)
is to be believed they have got over it. A big correspon-
dence is going on between the editor of the Engineering
anp Mining Journal and the alchemist who refuses to be
draw'll into revealing the secret. He declares he has
made 4oz. pure gold from 6oz. silver,,that the loss in the
process is only 25 per cent., and that the product has re-
sponded to every test. They reckon on a profit of 12s fid
on each ounce of silver they use. The new substance is
called “ argentaurum,” and “national calamity” is
already mentioned. One thing seems to have been lost
sight of : nearly' the whole value of the process would
depend on the fact of its invention being' kept a profound
secret. You could sell millions’ worth of “ made” gold ;
but once let the world know you were making it !

Dear Bulletin,--Merit.ion of a Sydney money-
lending society that works with a modest £2O capital re-
minds me that 1 am the inventor (as far as I know') of a
Co-operative Savings Bank Loan scheme which w'as first
put into practice at a London warehouse. Let me explain
my system for the benefit of all bodies of impecunious
young men w'ho may be gathered together in business.
We received our salaries monthly at the warehouse afore-
said. The savings-bank was formed by an issue of 20 £1
shares among some nine employes, who applied respec-
tively for one, two, or three shares, on, which 2s. fid. per
share was called up every month until our secretary—the
chief man in the counting-house—had all the capital in
hand. Then we started to draw loans on the 20th of Hie
month, each borrower being entitled to apply for hair as
much again a-« the amount standing to his credit in the
share ledger. Thus a holder of two shares might borrow
£3 if the loan capital wasn’t over-applied for, and as some
of the shareholders seldom wanted to borrow there was
generally a 50 per cent, margin available for the few
applicants. If they all wanted a loan each of them was
entitled to borrow just as much from the bank as he had
put into it. The loans were never issued before the 20th
of the month, and on the Ist of the following (the firm’s
pay-day) they were re-paid plus Is. in the £ interest.
Then for 19 days the money lay dormant in the cashier’s
desk, which feature of the system served to keep our im-
pecuniosity within respectable bounds and guarantee the ■
solidity of the bank. Every six months the interest pro-
fits (£6) were divided among the shareholders. A £2
shareholder who had borrow'ed his “ couple ” religiously
every month got back the 12s. interest he had paid,
whilst the prudent investor who hadn’t borrowed at all
drew an income at the rate of shixty per shent per annum.
—Cockney.
Squatter (to Chinaman, who is making use
of a short-cut through private property): ‘ ‘ There’s
no road here, John.” John: “You light, old
man, me call ’em welly bad bush-tlack. ”
M. M. Roseingrave is an Irishman who
was born an athlete ; he came to Sydney from
Ireland last January. Ho is just on 6 feet high,
weighs, stripped, 11 stone; and is 23 years old :
he is the second youngest of five brothers, the big-
gest of whom reaches 6ft. sin. Koseingrave began
contests when he was sixteen; at seventeen he
did a 22ft. 4in. long jump; a sft. Bin. high jump,
and a 48ft. lOin. hop, step and a jump. When 20
years old he high-jumped 6ft. OJin. ; long-jumped
23ft. lOiVm., but the latter was disallowed as a
record because Roseingrave when taking off came

over by half an inch. As it is, he recorded the
world’s amateur long jump on Sydney Cricket
Ground lately with 23ft. 7£. He also holds a
record hop, step and jump with 50ft. lin. He is
one of the finest hurdle racers ; at the recent big
Sydney sports meeting no Australasian or other
competitor in the 120 yds. hurdles could get to
him by yards. He never trains for his contests
on system ; he does not have any of the rubbing
down which the orthodox athlete ranks second
only to sleep. At the same time, he is a man who
never runs into flesh; his is the limber fibrous
type. He has never done any sprinting ; in fact,
the only athletic exercise to which he has “ laid
his mind ”is jumping. Dumb-bells he uses about
once a year.


Dear Bulletin,— Re Centralian frogs and
Percy Hodgkinson’s letter of Sept. 12. We were
a small and enthusiastic prospecting party, and
had braved many privations, the chief trouble
being the awful need of water. For two days we
had neither tasted, touched, nor handled
moister than a tin of sardines, when one evening-
after a long tramp, we struck a shallow two-acre
lagoon, well-shaded. We were at a loss to account
for the fact that the water had not evaporated
under the blinding sun that had scorched the
country for weeks, but wasted no time in specula-
tion. Next morning, on awakening after ten
hours’ sleep, we found, to our horror, that the
water had disappeared, and only a drove of gigan-
tic frogs with aldermanic corporations sat dumped
down in the heaviest shadows, blinking sardonic-
ally into our amazed faces. We had neglected to
charge our bags, and the mysterious disappearance
of the water seemed to mean death to us all. We
remained in camp throughout the day, too hope-
less and miserable to exert ourselves. Imagine
our wonder and our joy when, a little after sun-
down, the shouts of the boss of the party, Pascoe
Dow, 1.N.F.R.N.L., L.1.R.E., called our atten-
tion to the fact that water had re-appeared
in the lagoon. It is useless to attempt
to enlarge upon the profound astonishment that
possessed the party, or to detail the thousand and
one stories advanced to account for the apparent
miracle. We determined to make sure of a supply,
and filled everything that would hold water ; and
it was well we did, as at eight o’clock next morn-
ing the lagoon was again as dry as a bimetallic
leading article. The superstitious fears of the
majority of the party led to a hurried departure
after that, so I was not enabled to investigate
closely ; but I am now convinced that the portly
frogs we noticed were the new water-conserving
variety, and my theory is that they swallowed the
water at sun-up in order to prevent loss by evapo-
ration, and disgorged it again at sundown to revel
in their native element. Travellers in Central
Australia now drive droves of these frogs before
them through dry country, to avoid the necessity
of carrying water and the risks of death from
drought. They are easily driven, I believe, and a
couple of good sheep-dogs will manage 80,000.
Care has to be taken, however, as sudden and
simultaneous evacuation sometimes leads to floods.

A CHARACTERISTIC AUSTRALIAN PLEASANT
SUNDAY AFTERNOON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Won’t you let me ? —Won’t I let you what ?
Can’t you guess ?—l’m not going to bother guess-
ing your silly riddles !
Try !—No, thanks. How pretty those she-oaks
Where ?—Over there on Harbrow’s hill.
By Charman’s ? —Yes.
Yes, they are pretty, aren’t they ?—Yes, I
think so.
They are she-oaks, aren’t they?—Yes, of course
they are ! How silly you are !
They’re not he-oaks, are they ? —Oh, don’t be a
goat!
I’m not being a goat. I thought they must be
she-oaks.—Well, I said they were she-oaks ! Why
do you think they must be she-oaks ?
Because they’re pretty. —Well, aren’t he-oaks
pretty too?
Not nearly so pretty as she-oaks. —Rot!
All right! . . . . Are we going to drive round
by Eumlumering ?
No, we’ll go through old Naree.—Why do you
go that way ?
I like it better. —Why?
Well, it’s more shady, for one thing.—Oh, you’re
always on for shade ! It’s not hot.
You say so, but Trivet’s beginning to sweat. —A
lot you care if Trivet sweats !
Don’t you think I do?—Well, perhaps you do,
but that’s not why you’re going home old Naree
way.
Why do you think I want to go old Naree way ?
—I don’t know.
Why do you want to go by the main road ?
I didn’t say I did.
Do you want to go home by the main road ?—I
don’t care which way you go.
Oh, I thought you did ! —No.
I say, will you let me? —Oh, don’t be silly ! Will
I let you what ?
Will you let me hold your hand ?—What for?
Oh, just for fun.—l don’t see where the fun
comes in.
I do, though.—How can you hold my hand and
drive too?
Oh, that’s easily done!—You’ve tried before,
then ?
No, never. —How do you know it’s easily done?
Why, just like that, see?—Well, I don’t see the
good of it, anyhow.
Don’t you like it?—No, you silly idiot!
Not when I squeeze it like that?—Oh, don’t!
You hurt me!
All right, I won’t hurt you.—Oh, let go, let go !
There’s the Bolderives’ trap !
Well, they can’t see. . Besides, I don’t care if
they do !—I do, though.
I don’t believe you do care.—Why ?
Because you let everybody see you the other
evening.—What do you mean ?
Oh, you know —at the Mechanics’ Ball. —What
on earth are you driving at ?
Didn’t you go out after dancing the Alberts ?
Well, what if 1 did ?
Oh, nothing. —No ; tell me, what are you trying
to get at ?
Who were you with ?—I forget.
Oh, do you?—Yes, I do.
I suppose you forget that Charlie Ailing nipped
on to you for the Alberts ?—Well, what if he did ?
But that’s not all. —Well, go ahead.
You both went out and sat in Hansman’s buggy.
—Well ?
Little Teddy was under it.—l know. The
little brute !
Yes, but you didn’t know it then!—l didn’t
care if there was a dozen of them under it!
Teddy was on for a lark; so he went and got the
lamp off the gatepost. —Yes, and flashed it on us.
Yes ; and Ailing had his arm round your waist,
and you let it stay there. —Well, there’s nothing
in that!
I didn’t say there was.—Well, what’s all the
fuss about ?
I think it’s you makes the fuss, not me. —I don’t
make any fuss.
You won’t make a fuss if I——? —Now, don’t be
stupid.
Why? —Because I don’t think it’s nice.
I do ! —Why do you want to kiss me ?
I never said I did, did I ? —Well, you as good
as said you did.
I never said a word about it.—Well, I say!
What did you put your arm there for ?
Because I wanted to kiss you.—You said just
now you didn’t.
No I didn’t.—l think you’re dotty.
So I am. You make me dotty.—How ?
You’re so pretty.—Oh, stop that.
Yes you are.—You don’t think I’m as pretty as
Mil Tibson, do you?
Oh, no; not at all! Not a little bit! —Well,
why don’t you try and kiss Mil Tibson ?
Oh, she’s too pretty. I only like kissing the
ugly girls.—Oh, thanks !Do you think Mil’s
pretty ?
No, she’s not my style. Do you?—Yes, I think
she’s a very pretty girl. What’s your style?
You are.—-Oh, of course, you had to say that.
I could say it all Sunday. I say, won’t you give
me one ? —No.
Do!—No.
Why?—l don’t want to.
I’ll take one. —You dare !
What’d you do?—l’d scream.
Is that all ?—l’d pinch you.
It’s worth it. —Is it ! I’d hurt you very much.
With that little hand ? Now, what can you do ?
—l’ve got the other free.
I’ll have that too. —You’ll have to drop the
reins, then.
Oh, Trivet’s all right.—l’ll click, and make him
bolt.
You would, would you?—Yes, I will, if you
don’t let me go.
Oh, I’ll soon settle that ! I’ll drive him up facing
the fence, by the tree. Now, what can you do?—
Ah, let g.>, Harry. Mr. Walker, let go ! Gee
up, Trivet !
It’s no use. You may as well cave in.—Ah,
don’t, Harry, don’t! .. . What a silly boy you
are ! . . . Do stop it. ... Ah, do stop it !. . .
You are a silly old duffer. Just look at my hair.
. . . Now, that’s enough !
Just one more.—Well, only one. ... I didn’t
say fifty. . . . Goodness gracious, Harry, stop !
Here are the Bolderives coming back !
By George, so they are ! Woa bade ! Click-
click. Gee-up, Trivet! I don’t think they saw
anything ; do you ?

The Boer of the Rifle.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Gov. Hampden, at Sydney rifle meeting, said the best
wish he could accord Australia’s riflemen was that if ever
they were called upon to defend their country they would
prove as good marksmen as the Boers.
Worthy tribute to the trekkers of the boundless
vasty veldt,
Dwellers by the Land of Ophir, heirs of Argo-
nauts of eld ;
These be brave men, O my brothers, heroes cast in
stubborn mould,
Sturdy sons of sterner fathers who have fought and
bled of old;
Let the pallid Jingo whimper o’er the gold-bugs of
the Rand,
Glorify the bush marauders of the British Char-
tered band ;
Let the hollow-chested Johnnies who have never
seen a war
Prate their blatant idle chatter—we will take it at
its par.
Now and then in moments tranquil ’tween the
clamors of the age,
When the war-clouds cease to hover and the cables
cease to rage,
It is wise to weigh and ponder on the follies of the
race
Swayed by prejudice and passion into acts of deep
disgrace.
Is there need to point the moral of the silly Soudan
spree
When we helped to choke a people “rightly
struggling to be free ” ?
Are we still less human-hearted than the British
of the East
When they gave the Sepoy rebels for the cannon’s
morning feast ?
Driven from beyond the waters, from their homes
by Northern waves,
Left they old-world feuds and factions buried in
the old-world graves,
Sought they out the land primeval set beyond the
Gape of Hope,
Mile by mile they fought and conquered, plain
and mountain, vale and slope ;
Scarce had smiled the sun of Heaven on the full
fruits of their toil
Ere the greed of British commerce marked them
for the Lion’s spoil,
And the gallant Christian nation of the Bible and
the Bag
Dispossessed and hanged and butchered for the
Glory of the Flag.
Hunted down for England’s glory, glory that is
often greed,
Victims of the flag symbolic of the “ golden
cross ” of creed,
Pass the hardy pilgrim fathers towards the
waters of the Vaal,
Mile by mile they trek for Freedom far beyond
the natives’ kraal;
Write the story fair, untarnished by the prejudice
of race—
Brave men need no London hall-mark, deadly
shots no English face !
Need we worship Cant and Humbug, must we
indignation sham
When the Lion’s cub is cornered in its foray for
the lamb ?
Friends of Freedom, take ye solace, learn to shoot
as well as pray ;
Right is strong, but sight is stronger when the
guns begin to play.
Every ballot has its bullet now or in the future
days,
North and east the foe may menace—fix him with
unerring gaze.
Straight your aim, and ’midst the nations they
will learn to let you be,
For the rifle rings the orders of the Goddess of the
Jbree ;
Take a leaf from war-worn burghers, sons of
pioneers of old,
Men who proved that lead has virtues far surpass-
ing good red gold.

One of many Testimonials.
Bonnington & Co., Manufacturers of Irish Moss.
Adamstown, 11th September, 1896.
Dear Sirs, —Being a sufferer for years from fibroid phthisis and bronchitis, I desire to
add my testimony in favor of your Irish Moss. As a soother of irritating cough, with much ex-
pectoration, I have found it to be the most effectual of anything I have tried. It loosens the mucus,
which, therefore, comes more readily away, and the cough'is thereby considerably pacified.
Yours respectfully, THOMAS STOKER.
