It. is hard in Australia to got even a nod-
ding acquaintance with recent foreign literature
other than British, for the books never reach us.
Is there a single Australian who could pass an
examination in Huysman, Maeterlinck, or Ver-
haeren ? —to say nothing of Verlaine or Baudelaire,
or others comparatively far-back. Yet Maeter-
linck seems probably quite as notable as Tolstoi,
and Verhaeren and Verlaine have far more poetical
significance than the rabbits of the English warren,
like Kipling or Watson, of whom every local body
with a smattering of letters can appraise the
merits. And what, generally speaking, do we
know of Russian literature, beyond the well-ad ver-
tised names—or of German, or of Scandinavian ?
Really, if somebody would establish a cosmopoli-
tan bookshop, and keep the Southern Cross
abreast of the northern lights, it would be a Boon.
But it would need cosmopolitan capacity to con-
duct the bookshop—and, if it paid at all, it
would pay only little and slowly. There is much
more profit in selling Anthony Hope and Marie
Corelli to the undiscriminating female.
* * * »
A note on Emile Verhaeren in Nov. Fort-
nightly brings a little knowledge of that very
strong and skilful poet, one of the leaders of a
minor Belgian renascence. (Scant comfort to
find that he is almost unknown in England.)
Born near Antwerp in 1855, he studied law as a
youth, and as a young man left law for literature.
His chief field was L’Art Moderne , a Brussels
periodical, to which he contributed critical prose
and melancholy verse. He has written much—
and almost all his work is distinguished and
impressive. The vers libre is his preferred medium
—moulded and colored to his thought—with lines
now long, now short, rhymed or unrhymed, linked
in verses or otherwise, as the spirit wills. An ex-
ample of his color-verse in the manner of Verlaine
is given—
La neige tombe indiscontintiment
Comme une lente et longue et pauvre laine
Parmi la morne et longue et pauvre plaine
Froide d'amour, chaude de haine.
• * • *
Some weeks ago these exquisite lines by Ver-
haeren were printed, with a suggestion that trans-
lations should be sent :
PIEUSEMENT.
La nuit d’hiver 61£ve au ciel son pur calice.
Et je live mon coeur aussi, mon coeur nocturne,
Seigneur, mon coeur! vers ton p&le infini vide,
Et n&mmoins, je sais que rien n’en pourra l’urne
Combler, et que rien n’est dont ce coeur meurt avide,
Et je te sais mensonge et mes Ifevres te prient
Et roes genoux ; je sais et tes grandes mains closes
Et tes grands yeux ferrous aux ddsespoirs qui orient,
Et que c’est moi, qui, seul, roe rfeve dans ies choses;
Sois de pitid, Seigneur I pour ma toute ddiuence,
J’ai besoin de pleurer mon mal vers ton silence. . . .
La nuit d’hiver (‘■l&ve au ciel son pur calice.
If the versions received represent local capacity,
the gentle art of translating is still to acquire in
Australia. Only one of fair merit came to hand,
from T.S.R. ; there were tolerable from M.N.,
A. 8., Adam, and Patroclus ; and worthless from
G.M.V.K., .T.G.D., H.A.J., 8.F., H.M.J.,
M.F.K., Anon, Mt. Barker, J.J., and R.F.L.
* * * *
Some of the translators did not know the mean-
ing of the French ; some were not in tune with
Verhaeren’s spirit; some were too lazy to hunt for
the just word, and sent approximate paraphrases ;
some padded intolerably, and altered the poem’s
swing and sense together— e.g. :
The winter night lifts up to heaven
Its chalice pure—its cup—
Its snowy cup—the wintry night
To the still skies lifts up.
Which is meant to represent Verhaeren’s single
line
La nuit d’hiver elfeve au ciel son pur calice.
As an example of another kind —
The winter night hei chalice lifts on high.
And I uplift my winter heart of night,
O God ! towards thy pale Infinity.
Ana yet I know ’tis but an empty height
And ’tis for Nothing that I thirst and die.
I know thou art a Lie. . . .
Line 1: pur is omitted, and the sense of the
flower-freshness of the night goes with it. Worse
is the indefinite rendering of au ciel by “on
high.” Almost the best of the poem’s magic
comes in the imaged correspondence between
the uplifting of the Night and that of the
Soul towards something : and this vanishes
unless the toivards sense is got in. To make the
vanishment complete, aussi is omitted from line 2.
The force of the treble mon cceur is slurred ; the
one word vide is expanded to a line; line 4, to
combler in line 5, is omitted altogether, and the
remainder of line 5 is mistranslated. And so on,
with the final result of misinterpreting Verhaeren
with discreditable dexterity. For a translator is
no translator if he omit a single nuance of the
author’s thought, or insert a single nuance of
thought which is not the author’s. That to begin
with ; and when the spirit is accurately reflected,
form and melody and atmosphere must be copied
also till there is no room for the acutest caviller
to get the point of his nib in.
* * » *
Here is T.S.R.’s version—
ASPIRATION.
The winter Night her chalice lifts to Heaven.
And I too lift my heart, my night-tuned heart,
O Lord, my heart! to thy pale, endless Void,
Though knowing well its cup can by no art
Be filled, and naught it craves when death-destroyed:
A lie I know thee, whom my lips beseech,
To whom I bow : thy folded hands I see,
Thy great eyes closed ’gainst all despairing speech.
’Tis I who dream myself into infinity.
On all my madness. Lord ! O shed thy halm:
I needs must weep my trouble to thy calm. . . .
The winter Night her chalice lifts to Heaven.
“ Aspiration,” for the title, is good. English
“ pious” is shallow compared with French pieux :
it does not bring the same sense of veneration and
solemnity: “ piety,” for us, has become rather a
ridiculous, bourgeois emotion, linked with the
spectacle of a fat grocer kneeling with a fat
prayer-book to consider not the lilies, how they
grow, but the customers, how they pay. Pur is
again omitted—a loss ; but something is gained by
personifying Night, and the correspondence of
the toivards is preserved. Lines 2 ;ind 3 seem
about as good as they can be got, and if there is a
better word for nocturne than “ night-tuned,” in
the circumstances, one wants to know what.
Lines 4 and 5 weaken a little, but not much, and,
considering their difficulty, the quatrain is a thing
to have modified pride in. T.S.R. gives an alter-
native line 4 :
Knowing its thirsty cup can by no art—
and defends “ thirsty ” as developing Verhaeren’s
thought as he would have done himself had
rhyme and rhythm permitted. “The best of
poets feels to some extent the trammels of rhyme.
Suppose that V. wrote equally well in French and
English : it is certain that in each language he
would find words and sounds which would express
different phases of his theme better than any
words and sounds in the other. Now, is it not
permitted to a translator of the French Verhaeren
to vary the mould of thought as V. might have
varied it had he written in English? In other
words, where his French obviously cramps V.,
is it better to cramp the English to match? or to
expand the idea, since English permits it? I
sa y_ eX pand. For example, the word urne has no
special virtue. It is only there because it sounds
well, and rhymes with nocturne. But it is awk-
wardly metonymyous for cceur. Tasse or coupe
would really match calice much better, but tasse
hasn’t the dull, luxurious roll of urne , and it doesn’t
Iyme. Plainly yon must translate uine-n t_by
e English “ urn ” vou can’t fancy the h art
lifting its urn to Heaven—hut by cup, wn c
habitually uplifted by the flowers suggested m
lice. And if you add ‘ thirsty,’you strengthen
e idea of heart-drouth which inspires the poem,
Pile perpetuating the flower-illusion >
iwer holds its thirsty cup for dew—and dew
is a language-association with parched hear
* * • *
This doctrine looks very much like that which
■fends evil-doing for the sake of the good which
ay come, and one would not, like to trust it 1
e hands of any lesser translator than-bw n-
irne, say. Reverting to T.S.R. :it is plain th
s does not close so well as he began : his ideas are
it identical with Yerhaeren’s, and Mere are
her flaws— e.g. , “despairing speech IS .
r “ desespoirs qui orient.” But on the whole he
is succeeded fairlv, and with another fortnight
lent in unstiffening it his version might be good..
* sjt * *
Now, for comparison and sighing, here is a ver-
on by Osman Edwards, in an English magazine
IN PIOUS MOOD.
he winter lifts its chalice of pure night to heaven,
nd I uplift my heart, my night-worn heart, in turn,
Lord, my heart! to thy pale, infinite Inane,
nd yet I know that naught the implenishable urn
ay pleoish, that naught is, whereof this heart dies fain,
nd I know thee a lie, and with my lips mate prayer
Ud with my knees: I know thy great, shut hands
averse,
hy great eyes closed, to all the clamors of despair;
is I. who dream myself into the universe ;
[ave pity' on my wandering wits’ entire discord ;
eeds must I weep my woe towards thy silence. Lord !
he winter lifts its chalice of pure night to heaven.
'his is poetically ahead of T.S.R., and on the
/hole closer to the original, though “naught the
mplenishable urn may plenish ” is too vague to
ender “rien n’en pourra l’urne combler.” And
‘ln pious mood ’’ is not so reverential as
‘ Pieusement —seems, in fact, almost a little
ollicking ; there is a substantial loss of poetry
vhen winter lifts its chalice cf night, as compared
vith Night lifting herown chalice ; butalinelike —
Have pity on my wandering wits’ entire discord—
lompensates for much ; and the whole effect is
ine. Why doesn’t some Osman Edwards come
orward in Australia ?

There! is not that a better Caligula than you will
mould from many pages of history ? Probably he
did not really look in the least like that : the
most consummate modern showman can only
build on the basis of the extraordinary traits that
astonished C.’s contemporaries ; but for a con-
ventional Caligula this is as good as you will get.
And here is Xanthippe! Kindly turn the

Well, that evening I loved him. I remember it as well
as if it had been yesterday. I had stewed a kid for
supper with garlic ; you get the relish of it better, if you
do it that way. Well, as we were having supper in the
court of the house—it was summer ;if you leaned back
you could see the figs getting streaked against the blue
sky till your eyes got dazzled. “ Well,” I said, “Socrates,
you must eat some garlic or else I won’t.” He said
“Why?” He was always asking why. I said, “Be-
cause,” and then he laughed at me. That hurt me like.
I began to get afraid it wasn’t going off as well as I thought
it would. So I got up, arid put my arms round his great
hairy neck, and said, “Socrates, I love you.” Then he
laughed again, and said, “ Why do you love me, Xan-
thippe?” Then I got all hot and flustered, because he
laughed at me again. I could never hear being laughed
at by a man. But for all that I answered him quite

Little items —
Coear Herald finds in the bush bards who have passed
iblication what might be called a “ * Sons of The Bulle-
n ’ Series (Law-son, Pater-sow, and now Dy-.?on).” . . .
jme reliable evidence is wanted concerning the
Oman who says of her sewing-machine, “ He is running
iautifully.” Woman ought, in compensation, to per-
inify such things as male, since man personifies his
lips, engines, and even ’buses as female. And the Scone
f.S.W.) paper not long ago printed a report from its
row Mountain mining correspondent, which said that—
North-west three miles of the above claim is the Daisy,
wned by W. Cloake and party. She is a 55 feet reef,
om two to three ft., carrying 3 ounce stone. She is on
le London market for flotation. One of the proprietors,
Mr. Cloake, took her to London and seems pretty sure
that he will get her off.” And so on. . . . B. B.:
"And ‘mouth’ comes fu’ sweetly in the imperishable

Frae where my love repaireth,

. . . J. D. Hennessey, the busy Sydney writer, is hurrying
down the literary hill as fast as his pen will carry him.
His first book, “ The Dishonorable,” showed something
of the stress and pang of thought—was clever and pro-
mising. His second, “ Wynnum,” was frank, easily-
written rubbish. His third, “An Australian Bush
Track,” is rather worse—the crudest imagination mixed
with bits of neat enervation and description which show
how well H. could write if he took pains. And it is
advertised as eomplaisantly greased by Govt. House.
Govt. House ought to know better.

And, waiting', with a smile
He gave it life and breath and earthly hue s
“ Go and redeem
Some soul, entombed in guile.”—
That dream was -Heaven incarnated—you t
And then we met,
And in your eyes I saw
The promise of a Paradise untrod ;
Half-blinded yet,
I recognised the Law,
The peerless image of a living God.
Ah, me! You fell,
And died in reckless shame—
Then Heaven and its angels vanished too :
Yours was their knell;
You bore their holy name ;
And God fell with you, and He died, like you.

But few of noted specialists have sprung into pre-emi-
nence and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston, a
resident and practitioner at 121 Collins-street, Melbourne.
His name has become almost literally a household word ;
almost every other man you meet has a wonderful story to
relate of some almost miraculous cure he has performed in an
acute or chronic case of long standing, where other physicians
have failed. He addresses himself in particular to cases that
have baffled the skill and science of other doctors. His name
is a sufficient guarantee of a perfect cure of every case he
undertakes. Consult him this day. It may save you much
mental and physical suffering, and add golden years to your
life.
YOUNG MEN.
You will find this distinguished doctor your best friend
ipifl benefactor. If you are troubled with want of sleep, a
tired gloomy feeling, and loss of energy, which impair Loth
your body and brain, and absolutely unfit you for study,
business, or the proper enjoyment of life ; if you are suffering
from these or similar symptoms you know the cause. Before
it is everlastingly too late, consult this reliable old specialist,
who thoroughly understands your trouble, and can treat it
with unfailing success.
MIDDLE-AGED MEN.
There are many of you afflicted with weak, aching back
and kidneys, loss of mental and physical power and vigor,
and not unfrequently a' co -n pan led by an impairment of the
general health. In justice to this celebrated specialist it can
be truthfully stated that in all such cases of middle-aged
men, as well of young men, his success has been almost
invariable.
Troubles of every kind, name and nature, treated far in
advance of any institution in Australia—female complaints,
liver, lung, chest, throat, stomach, bladder, kidney and heart
disease ; rupture, piles, fistula, hydrocele and kidney troubles.
VARICOCELE.

press, price £2. Constitutional or acquired weaknesses

CONSULTATION is free to all, but where £1 is enclosed a careful diagnosis of the case will he made, and
appropriate medicines sent. Before confiding your case elsewhere, consult the old and sucoes; ul Specialist,
SURGEON LANGSTON. A friendly letter or call may save future suffering. New edition of my 1-ates. work, “ Mens
Sana in Corpore Sanq,” nearly 100 pages, sent free to men.

Will be Pleased to Welcome his Friends

Dr. GIBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered-in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
SPECIAL DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
m any years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraoed in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men
who suffer from any of the following symptoms,
namely : brequent headaches, giddiness, drowsi-
ness in the daytime, irregularity of the bowels,
feeling of fullness after eating, specks before the
eyes, halos or circles round a candle, cold hands
f-nd feet, pains in the back or under the shoulder-
blade, tenderness of the breast-bone on pressure,
palpitation of the heart, clammy hands, an
aversion to society, a fear of something dreadful
about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, &c.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt of 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,
A COMPLETE MEDICAL WORK,
fully describing how all SPECIAL DISEASES
may be quickly and permanently CURED,
without loss of time and money. This book
will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
ONE POUND is Sufficient to Send
for REMEDIES
NECESSARY FOR THE CURE,
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DO NOT DELAY,
your case requires advice, and you can either call
and consult the Doctor personally, or, if you
reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
DR. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6d. in
stamps, and Dr. Gibbons will send you, post
free, the Latest Edition of his Celebrated Work,
in which you will find a list of carefully-prepared
questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.
NONE NEED DESPAIR,
as in every case undertaken by Dr. GIBBONS
A Permanent Cure
is absolutely assured.
Dr. GIBBONS uses none but the very purest
remedies.
PATIENTS are reminded that their LETTERS
ARE DESTROYED BY FIRE
immediately they have been read and answered,
and that their cases and names will remain a
secret between the Doctor and themselves.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A LITTLE MISTAKE.
Tis a yarn I heard of a new-chum trap
wu *1 ed^e the Never-Never,
v here the dead men lie and the black men lie,
And the bushman lies for ever.
1 was the custom still with the local blacks
tvT° ™ the “altogether ”
a J lad ess respect for our feelings then,
And more respect for the weather.
The t r °oper said to the sergeant’s wife :
-p bure, I wouldn’t seem unpleasant;
a j ere s women and childer r.bout the place,
And barrin’ a lady’s present—
There s ould King Billy wid niver a stitch
-bor a month —may the drought cremate him !
wa - n we ' n his dhirty head,
Where his ould Queen Mary bate him.
God give her strength ! —and a peaceful reign—
i hough she flics in a bit av a passion
ony w an hints that her shtoyle an’ Inks
Are a trifle behind the fashion.
d here s two of the boys by the stable now—
Be the powers ! I’ll teach the varmints
lo come wid nought but a shirt apiece,
An wid dirt for their lower garmints.
‘ % owld on > ye blaggards ! How dare ye dare
1° come widin sight av the houses?
111 give ye a warnin’ all for wanco
An’ a couple of pair of trousers.”
They took the pants as a child a toy,
The constable’s words beguiling
A smile of something beside their joy ;
And they took their departure smiling.
And that very day, when the sun was low,
Two blackfellovvs came to the station ;
They were filled with the courage of Queensland
rum
And bursting with indignation.
The constable noticed, with growing ire,
They’d apparently dressed in a hurry ;
And their language that day, I am sorry to say,
Mostly consisted of “ plurry.”
The constable heard, and he wished himself back
f( In the land of the bogs and the ditches—
“ You plurry big tight-britches pleeceman, what
for
You gibbit our missuses britches ? ”
And this was a case, I am bound to confess,
Where civilisation went under ;
Had one of the gins been less modest in dress
He’d never have made such a blunder.
And here let the moral be duly made known,
And hereafter signed and attested :
We should place more reliance on that which is
shown
And less upon what is suggested.
HENRY LAWSON.
THE MEN WHO WENT BEFORE.
(An answer to Lawson's tale of the Men who Come
Behind.)
And it doesn’t strike you, Lawson, that “the
men who come behind ’’
Have sufficient cause for sorrow —and you
needn’t make it more—
Humping journalistic bluey where a thousand
tracks are lined,
Everything that’s worth the having snapped by
“ men who went befoi’e.”
You inay try to save the country, spend your life
in politics,
And you’ll find some cause or other leaves you
sadly in the wet,
Whilst you ask for cash to run it all the Press gets
heaving bricks—
“ Men who went before ” could borrow —you’ve
just got to pay their debt.
Go and seek a free selection ; nothing’s left but
rock and scrub,
All the soil that God created, all the dust on
earth is gone ;
Friendly owners warn you mildly with the meek
and lowly club
That they’re men who came beforehand, and
you’re forced to battle on.
Try your hand at mining, maybe, search for a
secluded spot
Where no other pick has ventured and the
shovel's quite unknown,
Spend a year in burrowing under till you think
the scent is hot
Thud ! the pick goes through and rattles on a
heap of human bone.
Tramp the tracks in search of tucker when it’s
useless cadging work
And your pride is getting streaky with the signs
of dead’ning rust —
You must tail that sad procession of adopted
“ Sons of Shirk ”
While the crowd ahead get tucker, you—come
in for all the dust.
Then you die and tramp to Heaven with the pass
you’ve earned below
And request the sleepy Peter to unlock the
jasper door,
But he tells you slowly, sadly, that you've got no
holy show,
For every inch available’s been taken up before.
Off to hell you go despairing—but the doors are
open wide,
And a bed and board eternal’s something
when your feet are sore.
Then you grasp the creed astounding as you gently
downward slide—-
“Men are brothers! Hell is roomy.” All the
rest have gone before.

Tobacco Manufacturers.
The BONANZA CIGAR.
DIXSON & SONS, by the aid of newly-invented machinery of surprising capa-
city, have placed upon this market at a Price Hitherto Un-
known Here a Cigar of exceptional quality.
The Finest Cigar Tobacco in the World
comes from Havana, and arrangements have been made for supplies from
there of the choicest Tobacco (Vuelta Abajo).
BONANZA Cigars are made of this Tobacco, with a necessary portion of
equally-choice Seed Leaf, and together they form a Cigar second only to the
recognised brands of high-class Havanas.
4 Full-sized Cigars for 6cl. !!—will at first no doubt
be prejudicial; but machinery, overcoming the great cost of production, just
permits a Cigar of such quality and weight to be made at a profit. DIXSON
and SONS intend the Bonanza Cigar to illustrate and prove what can be done
The “ BONANZA ”
comes as a pleasant surprise to many who, though capable of appreciating a
good Cigar, have lately been prevented through retrenched circumstances from
indulging in the hitherto expensive luxury.
Sample Boxes of 100 Bonanzas will be sent (carriage paid) to any
address on receipt of 10s. while this advertisement appears.

“The Bulletin’s” Federal Constitution.
During the last few years this paper has
published many articles on different aspects
of Federation, both as to what the Constitu-
tion should be and what it should not be.
But it has never yet attempted to summarise
what it regards as an ideal Federal Constitu-
tion, nor, so far as it knows, has any other
paper done so. Considering that the Con-
vention will shortly be sitting, unless some
further mishap occurs to the machine
within the next few weeks, the present
seems as good a time as any to pre-
sent The Bulletin’s Federal Constitution.
It is by no means a complete affair,
space being limited, but it covers the
leading points of the case, and covers them
as well as this paper knows how to do it.
Also, it isn’t absolutely ideal ; The Bulletin
itself can make out a remarkably strong case
against several of its own proposals, but it
advances them simply because there is a
difficulty which must be faced, and it can
make out an even stronger case against any
other solution. Especially on financial
questions and questions of representation it
seems impossible to arrive at absolute justice
to all parties by any system of Federation,
and it is still more impossible to do so by
not federating at all, inasmuch as none of
the provincial systems provide any decently
impartial method of dividing the expenditure
among the people who contribute the re-
venue, or dividing the representation so as
to give microscopic justice to every person
and class and interest. Therefore, the fol-
lowing outline is presented as the best and
fairest compromise among many difficulties
that The Bulletin can fashion.
* » • *
(1) The Federation to be knoWn as the Australian Com-
monwealth or Dominion or United Provinces or simply as
Australia, whichever way a majority of the Convention
may decide. Any name, as long as it isn’t too long or
too uneuphonious.or isn’Aalready in use somewhere else,
will serve the purpose.
(2) The Legislature to consist of two Houses. This is
partly because the bi-cameral system is so habitual that
an attempt at the unicameral system would probably
break up the whole scheme. Also, partly because the
existence of a Second Chamber will leave room for a com-
promise which will prevent New South Wales and Victoria
absolutely dominating the Legislature, and thus scaring
away the smaller provinces through the fear that their
independence will be wholly sacrificed.
(3). The Lower House to consist of, say, 200 members
elected by manhood or manhood and womanhood suffrage
only, there being 200 constituencies returning one member
each. The constituencies to be divided out according to
population in the most convenient manner, with no re-
gard whatever for provincial boundaries. The number
200 is suggested not because so many are essential for law-
makingpurposes, but because with a much smaller number
there would be a danger of making the electorates so
large as to be unmanageable. A proportionate increase
to be made when Queensland or M.L. or both of them
join the Federation.
(4.) The Upper House to consist of, say, 10 or 15 mem-
bers from each province elected on the same suffrage as the
Lower House, but each province to vote as one con-
stituency. This will undoubtedly give undue weight to
the less populous provinces until the diffusion of popula-
tion equalises matters, which it will do to a great extent
by-and-bye. But, on the other hand, if both Houses are
elected on a population basis the bogey of a possible
combination between Victoria and N.S.W. to run the
Federal finances for their own sole benefit W'ould probably
prevent some of the w'eaker provinces joining at all. The
need to make some sacrifice in the cause of unity sticks
out conspicuously just here.
(5.) Both Houses to expire or dissolve and be re-elected
simultaneously.
(6.) Members of the Lower House to receive, say, £3OO
a year salary ; members of the Upper House, say, £4OO or
£5OO. The exact figure is a matter of small importance,
but the extra salary is suggested in the case of the Upper
House partly because elections will be more expensive in
that chamber of vast constituencies.
(7.) Ministers to be elected individually at the meeting
of the new Parliament by both Houses sitting and voting
together, provision being made, however, that neither
House must contain less than tw»o Ministers. Each,
Minister to hold office for the full term of Parliament
unless he previously dies, resigns, becomes incapacitated
by illness (the conditions which constitute incapacity to
be defined by Parliament), is convicted of crime, or is
removed by a majority vote in both Houses. Ministers to
be eligible for re-election to an unlimited extent.
(8.) The two Houses to have equal power in all matters.
All points of disagreement to be settled without discus-
sion by the vote of both Houses sitting as one.
(9.) Any matter to be referred to a Referendum vote if
a certain fixed number of the people or a certain fixed
proportion (say one-third) of the combined Federal Legis-
lature or a majority of tbe Provincial Legislatures so
request. The Referendum vote in ordinary cases to be
taken (for reasons of economy) at the general election
only. An absolute majority of both Houses of the
Federal Legislature, however, may direct a popular vote
to be taken at any time in order to meet oases of emer-
gency.
(10.) The figurehead above the Legislature to be a
Governor-General appointed as at present, because there
is no better method just now available. When the
Federation is complete the Parliament of Australia may
insist on electing its Governor-General or replacing him
by a President, but until that Parliament is constituted
there is no authority strong enough to do so. And as the
Federal Parliament will be indefinitely postponed if it
doesn’t start till the imported British figurehead is first
done away with, it will be necessary to put up with the
usual Carrington or Brassey for the present.
(11.) The Federal Legislature to take over and consoli-
date all the public debts of the several States without
regard to the fact that some are larger in proportion to
population or are better represented by assets than
others.
(12.) The Federal Government to take over, as its
principal sources of revenue, the railway, postal and
telegraph receipts, and customs and excise revenue, and
to formulate a uniform customs and excise tariff through-
out its territories, all internal customs tariffs being
abolished.
(13,) The Federal Government to own and meet all
expenses connected with the railways, postal and tele-
graph departments, the military and naval forces —all
military and naval stores being handed over along with
the command of the forces, mints, patent office, the
entire public education system, the Supreme Courts, and
a number of smaller matters, including all rivers which
flow through more than one province. Where the public
debts taken over have been partly incurred for the
purpose of making loans to local bodies, these debts to
become Federal property.
(14.) In ease the sources of revenue above described
should prove insufficient, the Federal Government to have
unlimited powers of taxation to meet the deficit. In case
they are more than sufficient, the surplus to be used for
public works or in reduction of the public debt. The dis-
crepancies which arise under this system will, at least, be
no worse than those that exist under the provincial
arrangement, and, in course of time, things will probably
equalise themselves as nearly as possible. Anyhow, there
is no more reason why the Federal surplus, if there is one,
should be handed back in mathematically accurate pro-
portions to the respective provinces than there is for
handing back the provincial surplus in exact proportions
to each town and hamlet, according to the amounts
received from them and expended on them. If the pre-
sent system is good enough for Australia provincially, it
is probably good enough for the same place federally.
(15.) The Provincial Parliaments to retain the land
revenues, proceeds of probate and succession duties, land,
income, and dividend taxes, business licenses, port and
harbor dues, fines, and to have the necessary powers of
taxation to make up any shortage. But no borrowing
powers whatever to remain with the Provincial Legisla-
tures. Borrowing is only justifiable, if justifiable at all,
when undertaken for works which yield direct revenue,
and, as practically all the revenue-producing undertakings
will be in the hands of the Federal Government, the only
purpose of any moment for which the provinces could
want to borrow is with a view to faking the accounts and
producing bogus surpluses.
(16.) The Provincial Parliaments to control irrigation
works, ports and harbors, roads, bridges, and other purely
local works, police, inferior courts, &c. But —
(17.) Their powers of law-making to be defined by the
Federal Legislature wherever necessary. Their constitu-
tions to be capable of amendment by the Federal Legisla-
ture, especially with a view to the fact that one Chamber
of very moderate size and an elective Governor at, say,
£lOOO a year, would be fully sufficient for the local pur-
poses of each province. All powers not expressly reserved
to them to belong to the Federal authority. The Federal
Legislature to have power to define and extend its own
limits and define and extend or diminish those of the
State Legislatures wherever necessary. This last is prac-
tically the power which the State Legislatures now
possess with regard to municipal legislatures, and it is
absolutely necessary that there should be such power some-
where if perpetual conflict is to be avoided. Either the
people of Australia in their united capacity must be em-
powered to decide, when occasion arises, what authority
over themselves they shall exercise through the Federal
authority, and what they shall exercise provincially, or
there will some day be a deadlock. In any case, it will be
the people governing themselves ; the essential is that
where the people in one capacity collide with themselves
in another capacity they must have some means of sort-
ing the matter out.
(18.) The Federal Constitution to contain no provision
whatever for secession. There is no such provision in
any of the provincial constitutions or in the constitution
of any civilised State that The Bulletin is aware of. This
doesn’t in itself prove anything, but to make provision
for secession is merely to invite secession.
(19.) The Federal Legislature to meet provisionally at
some place to be agreed upon, and decide on its own
capital. The constitution-makers would do well, how-
ever, to recommend that the Federal city shall not be
selected from among the existing provincial capitals.
(20). The Federal capital and its immediate locality to
bi a Federal district belonging to and under the control
of the Federal authority only.
(21.) The Federal Legislature to be specifically entrusted
with the formation of a uniform criminal code and uni-
form laws relating to quarantine, marriage, divorce,
patents and copyrights, and banking and companies
generally. This latter is essential, for a multitude of
banks and companies do business in a large number of
provinces, and no provincial authority can regulate more
than the small part of their business which is done within
its own territory.
(22.) The Federal authority to have the sole power of
issuing paper-money. It may exercise this power directly
by issuing State paper-money from the Treasury, or
through a State bank, or indirectly by regulating the
issue of paper-money by private banks. ‘ State banks or
land banks run by Provincial Governments to have no
note-issuing powers except such as may be delegated to
them by the Federal authority.
(23.) The Federal Constitution to be capable of amend
ment in any direction on the vote of an abserendum. 3 °' 3
of the Federal Legislature endorsed bj ltele
The above outline is necessarily very im-
perfect but it expresses as clearly as P os&l^ e
The Bulletin’s opinions on the P Ol V£ *
warding which most controversy has u*
arisen. The central idea is that the peop
should trust the Federal authority as com-
pletely as possible, or not at all. It win re-
present the whole people, and, so far as ca
be devised, it will be the people, and l
people can’t trust themselves—whom can they
trust ? It will attract all the biggest men in
Australian public life, leaving the second-rate
men or the men who have not yet made
their mark to run the provincial legislatures,
and when troubles arise, as they must m the
imperfect nature of things, between ie
central and the local authorities it is neces-
sary to decide whether the balance of power
shall lie with the best men or the merely
second-best. The Bulletin votes for letting
it lie with the former every time. It is im-
possible to mffke things balance quite
mathematically ; some day it may be
found that there is either too much power
with the Federal authority or too much with
the provincial ones, and this paper believes
in letting the Federal authority have the
benefit of the doubt. One tyrant is bettei
than six ; one fool is also better than six. It
is impossible to fix up any scheme by which
each province will contribute exactly the
same amount per head in Federal revenue
and receive exactly the same amount in
Federal expenditure ; and if it were possible
to do so now the scheme would be hopelessly
awry ten years hence, and utterly useless in
less than fifty years ; therefore, The Bulle-
tin proposes that the people should trust
themselves to do a reasonably fair thing by
themselves in their own interests, and not
seek out elaborate devices for tying them-
selves to something lest they should break
loose and do themselves serious injury
especially as there is nothing that they can
tie themself to which is large enough to hold
them. So long astheconstitutionprovidesthat
the Federal Legislature shall be the supreme
authority in Australia, that it shall be en-
tirely representative of the people, and that
it can be amended at any time by an easy
and accessible expression of the popular will,
the future will be as safe as any human in-
genuity can make it. These things being
provided, the Federal system will be just as
good an institution as the people of Aus-
tralia deserve it should be.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The “Herald’s” Apology.
The New South Wales Government is getting
on well with that new protective policy which
it and its press barrackers allege isn’t Protec-
tion but a specially-advanced variety of Foreign-
trade. It recently let a big bridge contract to
a New South Wales firm at a price considerably
above a Victorian tender, the only visible
reason being that it was right and profitable for
the State to support local industry, even at
some small immediate expense to the taxpayer.
This is the view which every Protectionist
takes, but it sounds like an ignoble and ridicu-
lous back-down when advanced by a Freetrade
Government which has denounced over and over
again the “ bolstering up ” of industries by
“ artificial means,” and declared that they
must stand entirely on their own merits in free
competition with the whole world, or else go
under. It has been further decided to have
the poles and brackets for the new Sydney elec-
tric trams made locally, regardless of possible
discrepancies in the price, and to shut out the
foreign competitor altogether. The Govern-
ment is also calling for tenders for a huge
quantity of blankets and for 150,000 tons of
iron rails, and in both cases it is stipulated that
the goods are to be manufactured in New South
Wales. It isn’t simply proposed to handicap
the foreign maker with a duty, which is partial
Protection, but to exclude him entirely, which
is the whole animal in its most aggravated form ;
yet, strangely enough, the two Sydney ultra-
Freetrade papers both support these extraordin-
ary proceedings, and allege that while it is Pro-
tection to partly shut out the foreigner with a
15 per cent, duty, to shut him out altogether is
Freetrade, pure and undefiled. Both the
Herald and Telegraph stated proudly in
their issue of Jan. 13 that the steel rails already
alluded to, if manufactured locally, would only
cost <£150,000, or from that up to £300,000,
more than if they were imported, and neither
journal said one word against “bolstering up
the steel-rail industry ” with the taxpayers’
money, or “ coddling the local manufacturer,”
or “creating an exotic industry which couldn’t
stand on its own merits,” or uttered any of the
other curses which were evoked when the Dibbs-
Lyne Government followed exactly the same
policy over the much smaller iron-pipe con-
tract. The Herald, in fact, publishes a special
apology in its leading columns which is an
interesting sample of the abject and crawlsome
art of explaining things away :
Even if the locally-made rails should be dearer than
imported, the result will not be so bad as in the case
quoted, for by the operation of that pipe contract the
entire community does not pay the increased cost, hut
the unfortunate town that has to take the pipes. But
the principle is the same. It has always been recognised
that the Government might properly encourage the local
manufacture of such articles as were needed in consider-
able quantities. This could be done by paying up to
about 15 per cent, above the price of the imported article
in consideration of the advantages of having the material
made under local supervision, of saving interest charges
upon the very large stocks otherwise carried, and, of
course, employing the people remuneratively. It causes
pain and surprise in the minds of Victorian I r -tectionists
to witness the attempts of the Government cf this colony
to stimulate local industry by giving local contractors the
preference instead of by the orthodox method, which is
to shut out th: importer altogether. These critics look
upon a blanket or a steel-rail contract as true Protection
masked by a hypocritical Freetrade. They miss the point
altogether, which is that, while the action of the Govern-
ment in taking a local tender at a margin over the im-
ported price is quite voluntary, Protection compels
Government and community to take the local tender at
any margin up to the amount of duty plus freights.
Besides, we are none of us so extreme in the practice of
our fiscal faith. , . ,
The last argument is about the most abject
piece of stupidity which even the boss stupid
paper ever "perpetrated. According to it, it
the people put a Protectionist Government in
office, and openly impose Protection on them-
selves by their own act, and deliberately decide
to support local industries for their own benefit
then the proceeding isn’t voluntary. And
when they put a Freetrade Government in
power with direct instructions not to protect
or subsidise any local industry whatever,
and that Government proceeds to su b«>-
dise the local steel-rail biz. at the cost of
the community to the extent of somewhere
between £150,000 and ,£300,000 on no authority
at all, it is quite voluntary. In other words, if
Protection is forced on the people without their
consent it is voluntary, and if they openly
adopt it then it isn’t voluntary. And the poor
mongrel Herald admits that “ the principle is
the same ” as regards the Dibbs pipe contract
and the proposed Reid steel rails contract, yet
it furiously cursed the former and mildly blesses
the latter ; and it said the former was Protec-
tion while the later isn’t. Also, it is quite
right for the Reid Government to “ encourage
local manufactures” by paying prices that are
15 per cent, higher than is necessary under the
blessed principle of Free Competition. Also,
“ we are none of us extreme in the practice of
our fiscal faith ” —not now, at all events. Our
colonial oath, no 1 Have the Fairfaxes any
fiscal faith left now to be extreme about ?
-
The Threatened New Guinea Kush.
Interesting to those who meditate prospecting
in New Guinea :
Inland, British New Guinea, 7th Nov., ’96.
Since my last to you we made a start for Mt. Victoria,
but have made poor progress, and are doubtful if we shall
be able to get through at all. Where we are camped now
is a native village, about 30 miles south of Mt. Victoria,
The people here carried us on for two daj's, and would
then go no further. Two stayed with one of our party
to guard the camp, myself and two others went on for
two days further to try and pick up fresh natives ; but
although we got within 15 miles of the Mount, we
could not see a single native or the slightest sign of track,
so there was nothing for it but to return to main camp
and start the two carriers back for the remainder and
return here. We are now going to try further to the
east, and may be successful in finding natives that way,
but without carriers we can do nothing, and if they can’t
be found there will be nothing for it but to return to
Port Moresby. We could get through ourselves easily
enough, but the loads we could carry would not keep us
for any time, therefore, even if on the field we would not
be able to do any good. The country is very broken and
the ranges very high (we crossed some 3000 ft.), and, worst
of all, very heavy scrub. All your track has to be cut, and
it is only at rare intervals you can see where you are going,
so there is no picking of road. You must just take them
as they come, and you can fancy what that means when the
hills are so high! They are generally also very steep, and
there is no level country to give you a spell. It’s up and
down all the way and you are also burdened with your
Winchester and revolver—these you must carry, and with
cartridges the weight tells up. A good fly is also an abso-
lute necessity, and quinine also —I had a touch of fever a
few days ago, but am again all right. This climate, how-
ever, is entirely different to the Australian and a man
cannot be too careful. Sickness here is no joke. I fancy
I mentioned in my last that the Governor returned and
also brought over 700 oz. gold. I saw some of it; its value
must be close to £4 per oz. The first thing he did on his
arrival in Port Moresby was to order that no hoys be
“ signed” till after the wet season, and especially men-
tioned our party. The law here is that you cannot take
a native more than 25 miles from where he is en-
gaged unless he is “signed” in a Govt, office. That
blocked us, and hence our present trouble. The
Gov. says that the south coast route is the only
practicable one by which to reach the field, and that
after the wet season is over the Gov. will cut a track.
Now if there is going to be a rush it will set in at once-
wet season or no wet season, and men will try and reach
the field in defiance of all opposition. The consequence
will be that fully 50 per cent, will leave their bones behind
them. If Govt, acted promptly with a wish to do good
and cut a road straight away it would be the saving of
many lives. So far since I have been out from Port
Moresby (about three weeks) the weather has been very
good—three thunderstorms, but only very light, and we
were under shelter at the time. The wettest season of
the year is about the same as Queensland —January and
February. We may expect thunderstorms until then.
But where the great drawback and danger will lie is the
question of carriers. Now, the natives here are not over-
fond of hard work—they are much the same as others in
this respect.—but a few certain articles that the whites
have got they are very desirous of having, and will work
by carrying until they get them ; after that they will do
nothing except at very odd times. This is my" opinion,
and, I fancy, the opinion that any sensible man would
take when he comes to review the circumstances. So
that what it really amounts to is : the first few parties
may get carriers without any great trouble; after then,
the darkies will refuse. People coming here ought to be
informed of this, for, even if they get through to the field
itself, they won’t have rations to live on while there.
Burns, Philp and Co. are, as I have already informed you,
trying to open a track for horses, but even were it opened
there are, so far, very few horses here, and if the scrub
continues over to the main range there will he no feed :
so that for some time to come things will be very black
for new arrivals. Will write you again first opportunity,
if able to get through, which may not be for some time.
13th. —We are again on the river that we turned back
from (the Goldie), but about 13 miles higher up. We
were very doubtful of getting the natives here to carry,
as they are at loggerheads with the Government, who
blame them for “wiping out” a village on the coast a
few months ago, and it is only by bringing some neigh-
bors of theirs, who are friends, t hat we have managed to
get hold of them. We leave in the morning, and, as this
tribe is a large one, they will be able to see us a long way
on our journey. This letter will be forwarded to the coast,
and it will be the last communication that we will have
with it till we reach the field.

Marks.
A PAPER is generally to be judged by the letters
it admits into its columns, and on this basis
the S.M. Herald is distinctly against Austra-
lian Federation. In its issue of January 14
the mild old paper came out with a perfect
rush of correspondence, and among other things
it introduced to its readers one Thomas Marks,
who deserves to be held in reverence as the
only humorous aspect of Federation up to date.
Marks complains among other things that “it
would be tlia bounden duty of a Federal Par-
liament to legislate in the interests of all Aus-
tralia, however injurious it might be to the
mother colony, and one of these duties would
be to divert a very great deal of N.S.W. pro-
duce to Melbourne and Adelaide as the nearest
and most convenient ports of shipment.” Marks
declares himself against Federation lot this
reason. The Federal Government, by abolish-
ing border tariffs and building its new mi ways
to point straight to the nearest port inst ad of
to the capital of the province, would gi\e many
N.S.W. producers in the south and west a
much more adjacent outlet, cheaper freights
shorter haulage, and would enable them to have
lines where now they can have none be ;ause
trade which will justify the building of a
200-mile line won’t justify a 500-mile one. And
Marks, if there is such a person, professes to


cheerfully damn Federation because it will open
the way to the “nearest and most conve-
nient pot t. Let us all barrack for the Sydney
importer and damn the nearest and most
convenient port Moreover, Marks suggests
that the Reid Government “can only treat
Freetrade at the ensuing conference as the
settled pohey of N.S.W. which, Federation or
no federation, it cannot, without a gross
breach of faith with those who twice returned
it to power, permit for one moment to be ques-
tioned This seems unnecessary violence on
the part of Marks. If the people of New South
Wales prefer Freetrade to Federation they can
say so by rejecting the Federal Constitution
when it is submitted to the national vote. If
the province wants Freetrade so badly as Marks
say it does it will say so; Marks’s idea that
because New South Wales has voted Freetrade
twice it shouldn t be trusted to vote again is
very steep. Marks also complains that a
k ederal Government couldn’t be trusted to make
Sydney “ the key-centre of the trade and com-
merce of all Australia,” which seems quite
probable—as likely as not, the Federal Govern-
ment will let the trade go where it likes, and
won t make any key-centre. Also, Marks says
that the Federal Government wouldn’t pay
the salary of the New South Wales irri-
gation expert, and that it isn’t dead
certain that it would make Sydney the
capital, and it might even refuse to irrigate
N.S.W. at the expense of all Australia, and
might tell that province to irrigate itself, at its
own expense, like the others. The Bulletin
is struggling with sundry conflicting theories
about the Herald’s correspondent. One idea
is that the Herald invented Marks in all good
faith and stupidity ; while another is that
Marks is a huge joke perpetrated on an unsus-
pecting newspaper, probably by John Haynes,
and that his letter is a hilarious burlesque on
the Herald itself. The third possibility is
that Marks made a bet with Samuels that the
Herald would be dull enough to take him
seriously, and is now collecting the stakes ; or
else he is an ardent Federationist who is sys-
tematically bringing the provincial crowd into
contempt. The last possibility of all seems to
be that Marks is a real individual, and that an
enemy put his name to the letter for the plea-
sure of hearing him foam in Yiddish when he
read the awful thing. Anyhow, it isn’t every
day that something so wildly amusing as Marks
dawns on a tired community, and it is to be
\ hoped he will write again. /
Pharmacy and Federation. /
W rites “ X.Z.” to The Bulletin :
“ Bumble ”-itis seems to have gripped the rulers of
N.S.W. pharmacy pretty badly. One Colin M. M’Creary
told the Pharmaceutical Society of N.S.W. that he had
taken up his residence in N.S.W., that he had served four
years’ apprenticeship with a chemist registered in N.S.W.
though not now keeping shop in N.S.W, and that he
wished to present himself for his final (qualificatory)
examination. In place of the N.S.W. preliminary certifi-
cate he held and showed the matriculation certificate of
Melbourne University, which has been accepted in
N.S.W. times out of number in place of the prelim-
inary certificate. About that there was naturally
no grumble. Councillor Marshall moved that M’Creary
be allowed to go up for his final on his Mel-
bourne certificate being approved, and promptly
stultified himself by stating that he did not wish the
admission of an apprentice from another province unless
that province first admitted N.S.W. apprentices, which
means—“ N.S.W. is willing to be reciprocal, provided
some other province is reciprocal first.” Which practi-
tically means, “ This hoard will give way if other Austra-
lasian boards will first lick its boots.” Seeing that N.S. W.
has about the crankiest pharmaceutic and medical law of
all the Australias, the position seems, to say the least
of it, illogical. And particularly so when Victoria
and Queensland accept N.S.W. certificates in a spirit
of compromise, whilst N.S.W., with an inferior en-
trance examination, refuses to accept the more
difficult North and South ones. Perhaps, after all, Coun-
cillor Marshall meant well (though probably M‘Crbary
won’t think so), for he moved—“ That this Board would
only be too glad to allow Mr. M’Creary to come up for
the final examination, but, while working under the pre-
sent law, the application cannot be granted ; this Board
recognises the hardship, but has no power to accede to
the request.” What is wanted is an Australasian phar-
maceutical standard, so that the staydard certificate of
one province will be accepted in any other. The same
with medicine. Melbourne University, for example
refuses to accept inferior records and certificates, but, at
the same time, will consider all such records and certifi-
cates, and gives recognition tot pro quot, which, inter-
preted, means “ Show me what you’ve done, and I’ll give
you credit for exactly what you’ve done.” In fact, both
in druggistry and medicine let Australia have a standard
Staats Examen or Government examination, on which
all licenses to practise should depend.
No Creeds in the Commonwealth.
“ Cardinal Moran, if elected as a delegate to
the Federal Convention, will consider it his
patriotic duty to sit.” People now begin to
guess the meaning of Cardinal Moran’s pre-
liminary canter at the mushroom “ convention ”
which sprang up so suddenly and unexpectedly
at Bathurst the other day. That so-called con-
vention, mainly sustained by the purse of one
of the Cardinal’s most dutiful servants, in the
light of the present seems, to a suspicious
public, to have been the Cardinal’s little
feeler : should a complaisant public make no
objection to him there, he could try a bigger
coup. Yet if Cardinal Moran, the official repre-
sentative of the R.C. Church in Australia,
sits as a member of the Commonwealth Con-
vention, the national aspect of that Convention
is gone at once, and the door is opened for a
renewal of the miserable feud of creeds. It may
be a matter of regret that a man of the Car-
dinal’s mental gifts should be barred from can-
didature, but facts must be faced : while the
tires re-lighted and fanned by O’Farrell and
Parkes still smoulder there can be no more
unfit candidate in the community than the local
head of any church—for The Bulletin makes
precisely the same objection to the admission of
the candidature of any other creed’s official re-
presentative —Anglican, Wesleyan, or what-
not. None of them can dissociate himself from
his clerical position, and Australia wants no
creeds in politics. In regard to the ordinary
candidate, The Bulletin does not enquire
whether he is Roman or Anglican, Mormon or
Devil-worshipper, it is all one ; but when the
professed exponent of one particular brand of re-
ligion—who is practically unknown apart from
his association with that religion —who can only
secure votes because he is the locally-recognised
head of that religion—comes forward in what
will be universally recognised as the sheep s
clothing of “ a simple citizen ” and asks to be
permitted to take part in the work of nation-
building—in which religious creeds can have no
more share than vipers—The Bulletin is sure
of the support of enlightened Australian Demo-
crats, of all men of unbiassed intelligence, in its
vehement national protest.
Co-Social-Operation.
Certain shallow optimistic ‘ thinkers ’ and
teachers have, of course, made the ludicrously
absurd mistake of confusing socialism with co-
operation, and imagining that opponents of one
must also be enemies of the other,” snorts the
deep-thinking Argus, as though the aforesaid
assumption were not derived from hard facts.
Anti-socialists, with their eternal cry for
“ private enterprise ” and “ individualism,”
have always scowled at co-operation, though
they are among the most ardent customers of
co-operative stores when they can save money
by going there. A system which deprives
Capital of its power to oppress Labor can never
be advocated by the “ respectables ” of this
world, who hate the word Socialism as the
devil is fictitiously supposed to hate holy water.
Suppose for a moment that Victoria had no
railways and Melbourne were without its sinful
Met. Gas Co. Would the Argus be in favor of
a wise creation of State railways, and a supply-
ing of gas by the municipality for the benefit
of co-operating shareholders and the public
at large? Not much. We don’t find the
bloated capitalist and his beloved news-
paper agitating for a municipal electric-lighting
company to shatter the gas monopoly, or sing-
ing praises to State ownership of land. Now,
State ownership of land is the socialist’s bright-
est dream of co-operation, and private enter-
prisers rail against the great principle accord-
ingly.
The “Pure Merino” University.
Thus “ Fax ” to The Bulletin :
The late J. H. Ciiallis gave a-quarter of a million ster-
ling for the advancement of education and science per
medium of Sydney University. Much of the interest of
this is sopped up by a coterie of mediocre Scotch medicos,
who, nevertheless, are admirably adapted to do the
drudgery of coaching up youths whose parents, not Nature,
have destined them to be sawbones. The professors of
history, engineering, and English, by drawing their
screws, assist also to carry out the beneficent intention of
the late testator. It didn’t strike the University Senate
that ML Challis didn’t specially desire to find billets for
commonplace professors, but seemed to want to assist
tmifliant youths to secure admission to professions for
.which their gifts adapted them. Now, here’s where the
r specious liberality of the Senate conies in : there is not a
single bursary ( i.e ., annual reward-subsidy to poor but
brilliant candidates) given in the medical, engineering,
science, or law school— i.e., in any of the schools whose
existence is due to the magnificent gifts of the
deceased merchant, but they are given with the greatest
lavishness to those seeking to secure that wretched gew-
gaw, the B.A. degree. Can it be that the Senate fear that
the professions would be encroached upon by “ a very
undesirable class ” ? . . . That the course of the medical
school is as unsatisfactory as might be anticipated
from the calibre of the public teachers in that
faculty was prominently illustrated a short time since.
Noble old Macleay, seeing the tremendous possibilities of
the Science of Bacteriology and the immense part it was
bound to play in the near future in the Theory and
Practice of Medicine, gave a substantial legacy to en-
courage the study of that subject, making one condition
—that a few terms study of that subject should be incor-
porated in the five years’ medical course. The Faculty
were in doubt for a long time if they should accept a
legacy with so onerous a condition ; and ultimately, after
some lawyers had a dig at. the fund, the Court of Equity,
with owl-like gravity, gave the Faculty permission to
carry on the old man’s scheme in an emasculated form.
The poor Senate had hardly got out of this dilemma when a
grievance from an unexpected quarter loomed up. Some
wild-eyed youths from out Grabben Gullen way and the
plains of Boomoonoomona want to know why can’t they
get this bauble of a B.A. degree without attending lec-
tures at the central institution? They ask, and not with-
out reason, that, as the University is largely supported
by general State revenue, they should get the alleged
“ Hall-Mark ” of a University degree, if without lectures
they can pass the same examinations as the men who
have the “ tremendous advantage that coming into con-
tact with one another gives.” They seem to think
they could learn off as glibly as the Sydney-coddled
variety literary criticisms of works that neither has ever
read, and they even presume to think that the possession
of some elementary, if well-known, text-books on history
and philosophy and standard keys of languages and
mathematics would be quite as useful as the dictated
lectures of the Sydney professors. Two other topics
should be referred to : the parsimony of the senate in in-
sufficiently manning the supervisory examinations com-
mittees has led to more than one grave scandal ; and
secondly, influence, not brains, determines who shall fill
vacancies in the teaching body. The truth of this latter
was demonstrated the other day. A lecturer was ap-
pointed in the Arts faculty, although he was beaten by at
least one gold medallist, and although several other
medallists about the town (belonging to the “ educated
proletariat”) would have jumped at the offer. To sum
up, the University is at present run in the interests of the
professors and the pure merinos. To remedy this (1) a
large number of bursaries and scholarships should be
established in the professional schools ; (2) the B.A.
degree should be given to any one passing the examina-
tions ; (3) a degree which would be a guarantee of some
degree of culture and scholarship should be conferred on
men who should be compelled to reside at the University.
This would probably require the establishment of an
additional non-sectarian college similar to the Women’s
College. (4) Fellowships for enthusiastic men likely to
do good scientific work after having obtained degrees
should be endowed. (5) The present teaching-staff should
be remunerated at their strict market-value ; and (6) the
good old Equity Court should be invoked to allow the
bequests of Challis, Fisher, Macleay, and others to be
devoted towards purposes somewhat resembling the in-
tention of the testators.
And thus “ Sancho Panza ” :
Dear Bulletin,— Since the Sydney University authori-
ties insist upon attendance at lectures, one would expect
the fees to be as reasonable as possible. But what is the
case ? In Melbourne (where attendance is not compul-
sory) the lecture-fees for the B.A. course are 12 guineas
per year—total for the three years, 36 guineas. In Sydney
the fees are :
For the first year ... ... ... £32 18 6
For second ~ ... ... ••• 28 4 0
~ third „ ... ••• ••• 21 18 0
Total for the three years, £B3 os. 6d .—i.e., more than
double the amount paid in Melbourne ! And yet
Sydney University is far more richly endowed than
that of Melbourne. But it may be urged that high fees
are paid in Sydney in order to secure the best teaching.
Well, here is my experience : The professor of a certain
subject which is compulsory for all first-year students
began his course of instruction by talking over our heads,
usfno- a lot of highly technical language which was abso-
lutely unintelligible to us—a fact which he himself well
knew. After three or four lectures the learned professor
informed us, in his own peculiar sneering way, that
he was not there to teach us, and from that on to the
end of the course he fully demonstrated the truth
of this statement. None of us learned anything from his
lectures. Our time would have been more profitably em-
ployed in playing cricket, or doing the Block. As for the
f ees __but that is too sore a point to dwell upon. Another
member of the teaching staff always had his lecture
written out, and read it through in a monotonous, weari-
some style, just as a 10-year-old boy might be expected to
do, without raising or lowering his voice, or laying stress
on any particular portion. But why go on ? You are
right: the University seems to exist chiefly for the benefit
of a few grossly over-paid professors.
“ Fitzclarence ” on the Queensland political
situation :
Dear Bulletin, —The persistence with which the
Queensland "Government organ” and several pretty
well-informed hangers-on of the Plunder-party prophesy
the early withdrawal of Nelson from the leadership has a
good deal to justify it. It is almost a certainty that had
not the Queen-street drapery vote tumbled Tommy Byrnes,
the mantle of the chief would ere this have fallen on the
shoulders of his beloved lieutenant. The personal
acquaintances of the Lazy Knight can only account for his
continued vitality by the fact that he is not insensible to
the cajolery of public flattery, or that his desire for the
life of Boodlewraith makes him superior to the charms of
rest and rust. Byrnes, of course, won’t be taken at any
price. The party owes its solidarity to the presence of its
“ beloved chief.” Even with Nelson’s imprimatur it is
doubtful if the Attorney-General would get a majority of
the Govt, members, so that you will at once see through
the other man Tozer’s game. Even now Drake’s paper
is howling for Tozer —in preference to Byrnes. I doubt
if there is a more accomplished wire-puller in Australia
than H. Tozer. The results of, say, 12 months’ tinkering
with the Labor-party are: the partial conversion of
Glassey and Cross, and the “fixing” of little Frank
M’Donnell, of Fortitude Valley. And if the same subtle
serenading goes on much longer there is no saying how-
great a following would go with the “Minister for
Labor” in a new Tozer administration. On the other
hand, Byrnes has been proposed, and has been accepted
by Andy Dawson, the keen Charters Towers senior, who
will unquestionably influence a few of the “Twenty”
should the threatened disruption come. Maranoa King
(who was forced to declare his views on each plank of the
Labor platform seriatim on the eve of his election
because of his apparently weakening allegiance to the
reform policy) gave several votes dead against his party
last session, and he is therefore considered as a sure re-
cruit for one of the new factions. And then there is J.
Plumper Hoolan, whose latest moves are what, no fellow
can understand. He is in active warfare with the
Trades Hall people; is a doughty champion of the
Q.N. Bank, and has been knowm to bare his muscular
tongue in defence of the Ministry. The Boy from Burke
has given no whisper which could help one to discover
what new force is working with him, and, by general con-
sent, it is written down eccentricity. An all-wise Govt,
has sized the matter up cleverly enough, and John’s
eccentricity is to be given a chance to take definite shape
during a three months’ picnic on the mining commission.
Now, here are six cases in which “ the influence ” has pro-
duced outward and visible effect, and, apart from these
six, where will be found a man among the party with suf-
ficient nous to hold together the remaining forces ? The
game is being craftily played, and you may take it as a
prognostication that, ere many moons, Queensland Legis-
lature will consist of a Govt, and an Opposition, and that
the party of “ leaders,” sneeringly dubbed a “ faction ” by
Hugh Nelson, will have became the henchmen of the man
who has dropped his Liberal creed for one of mild Social-
ism, or the admirers of the adroit lawyer whom, in the
words of Dawson, “ You fellows don’t seem to under-
stand.”

The consensus of five Australian provinces in support
of Chief Justice Way’s nomination to a seat on the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council makes it certain
that he, if any one, will get the biilet. The other candi-
dates are LEFT.
In placid little Aramac (Q.), the other day, 52
persons, each grabbing a roll of notes, fell over
each other in the narrow doorway of the local
land-office, to enter their application for one
grazing-farm. Their deposits totalled ,£6BOO,
or nearly £l3O a man. The hideous fun
is that the winner is decided by lottery. It is
a wild gamble from the start, in a land wherein
gambling is forbidden by law, and from enter-
ing which newspapers publishing gambling
advts. are barred. It is not always—or, rather,
it has not always been a clean and straight
gamble. Cases have been suspected, and some-
times actually known, where the lottery has
been faked, and the fakir has received a hand-
some present from the land-shark benefiting
by the manipulation of the machinery. The
alleged intention of the Act under which
these lots are drawn is that the poor
man and bond fide selector shall have as
good a chance as the rich man who
only wants to add to his acres, or as the specu-
lator who only desires to sell out at a premium
to the first eager bidder. The alleged intention
of the Act, therefore, is the same as the genuine
intention and actual results of “ Tattersall’s
Consultation,” banished from the St. Peters-
burg of Brisbane to the Siberia of Hobart.
In the Aramac case, there is very little
doubt that 46 out of the 52 applicants were not
bond-fide intending settlers, but merely gam-
blers on the chance of getting £5OO premium
on their luck. The Rockhampton (C.Q,.)
Record puts the proportion of these gamblers
at 80 per cent. ; but the writer adds 10 per
cent, for the Record’s obtrusive bias for
all things Centralboodlewraithian —including
alleged honesty.
“The Prince of Wales, referring to the intended cele-
bration in honor of the completion of the sixtieth year of
Her Majesty the Queen's reign, states that he feels assured
that amongst its features will be included some movement
in the direction of an effort to ameliorate the condition of
the poor throughout the Kingdom.”— Cable.
The good Judge went to London—
(The jolly black cap !)
The good Judge went to London—
(The Lord ha’ mercy !) ;
A bloody mist rose o’er us ;
Seven gibbets creaked in chorus ;
Lo ! Golgotha lay before us,
When the good Judge went to London.
The good Judge climbed the backstairs—
(ls the rope greased ?)
The good Judge climbed the backstairs—
(ls the prayer said ?)
A wind blew off Mount Rennie,
And the devil in his den, he
Swore and shivered more than any,
When the good Judge climbed the backstairs.
The good Judge knelt on the cold mat—
(How the bolt groaned !)
The good Judge knelt on the cold mat—
(How the blood leapt !)
The body for God’s acre
The wife begged ! . . . Sweet to take her
That image of his Maker,
When the good Judge knelt on the cold mat.
The good Judge fell with a dull thud—
(Cut down the carcase !)
The good Judge fell with a dull thud—
(Shovel the earth in !)
As that glad note resounded
Beneath the pavement mounded,
The merry black bones bounded
When the good Judge fell with a dull thud.
To a heartless greed for wealth the money-
making men are urged,
A greed that has no confines of satiety ;
They might show consideration for the groaning
tenth submerged
If pity paved the pathway to Society.
But gold alone will do it; they must feed a
dozen earls
And curry favors hollow and transparent,
When the object of the missis is to “ elevate ”
her girls
Through a visit from the royal Heir Apparent,
The world of rank, and fashion lias no room
within its ring
For cranks who would ameliorate conditions ;
Its parvenu inhabitants must grease the Coming
King
And uphold a money standard of “ positions. ”
From the Monarch in the centre, with nobilities
around,
The circles spread to plutocratic classes
Who are striving, ever striving, to get on to
holy ground
By the aid of profits sweated from the masses.
His Highness, Albert Edward, asks for efforts
to be made
In a modern socialistical direction :
He loves those folks who suffer “ in the interests
of trade ”
With an almost more than fatherly affection.
Does lie want to start a movement for the
benefit of man ?
Well, let him curse the Crown and Consti-
tution,
And bid the “ lower orders ” lend assistance to
his plan
In the only way they can—a Revolution.

The second production of the M‘Carthy
season, at Sydney Lyceum, “True Irish Hearts,”
does a hard and furious sprint for first place as
the dullest Irish drama going. The title fits
badly, to begin with ; the story is mostly Yankee,
and there is only one Irishman in it, that lone-
some broguey person being a flunkey in the em-
ploy of an American baronet, or at least an un-
accountable baronet in America. The play was
evidently built round this allegedly funny person ;
he comes in on his head amid a blizzard of broken
crockery, and thereafter he holds the centre of the
stage for long, weary periods while a servant-girl
asks him questions to give him an opportunity of
firing off the old Joe Millerism that is lying on
his chest. The questions are very much like those
that the middle man in the “ first part ” asks of
the burnt-cork nigger with the bones, and they fit
into the drama as neatly as if the prompter
brought in the book, and hunted up the place with
a damp forefinger and a wet thumb, and read off
the conundrum and then looked up the answer in
the index. The Irish-American “musical comedy
drama,” as it is nowadays, is an airy scrap of
fancy which frisks as lightly as the Hon. John
Lucas and a kedge anchor.
* * * *
Apart from the sere and yellow chestnut
of the Irish flunkey, there isn’t much drama.
Scot Inglis, who is a bad, unshaven character,
keeps turning up periodically to restore Miss
Harrie Ireland’s lost child in consideration of
much immediate bullion, but he generally restores
the wrong child. Miss Ireland lives in continuous
horror lest her baronial husband should get to
know of this child, though it was born in wedlock
and there is nothing wrong about it. An itinerant
German organ-grinder also arrives casually with
more lost child, and the baronet, who is a sort of
warm-hearted home for lost dogs, takes them all
in and adopts everybody. Scot Inglis mur-
ders the baronet rather publicly, without excit-
ing much attention. Finally, Inglis falls over
the wall of an Irish castle, and as he isn’t
quite dead the funny man is understood to
drop a boulder on him from a great height;
in the presence of several ladies and others, and
flatten him to death. Then Miss Ireland remarks
that the clouds have now passed away, or words
to that effect, and some one else states that sun-
shine is restored or thereabouts, and they all
agree that the funny man who has just dropped
the rock on Inglis is a noble, warm-hearted son of
Erin. Miss Ireland bestows her hand and her
immense wealth on the German organ-grinder,
who tries vainly to look like “ Hans the Boat-
man,” and the lost child is sorted out, and some
one rises up about this time to say that the gloom
having been thus lifted, he has invited the neigh-
boring peasantry to do a song and dance, where-
upon the weary jig eventuates as usual. The
generous Irish way in which the boulder is
dropped on Inglis, with the approval of the ladies
and everybody else, is the one really original
feature of the play. A number of people are
variously connected with this production, but The
Bulletin has no desire to make their misfortune
any more public* than is absolutely necessary.

The second edition of “ Sinbad ” was pat
op at Her Majesty’s (Sydney) last Saturday. It
contains a number of new songs, which are a little
brighter than the old lot, and a certain Miss Fin-
lay, who does Miss Bessie Clayton’s famous back-
kick as well as the great original contortionist—at
least the present writer sees very little difference.
Lucifer, the astonishing high-kickist, varies his
entertainment now by going into the dreary heavy-
weight business, and lifts with one hand a dumb-
bell weighing 2001 b. This is a sufficiently wonder-
ful performance, but for concentrated dreariness
the heavy-weight business has few equals, and
even if Lucifer lifted a dumb-bell weighing
2000 cwt. it would be difficult to view the circum-
stance with any great interest. Lucifer’s new
business isn’t all of the 2001 b. dumb-bell order,
however, and when he isn’t laboriously humping
large pieces of iron he is a highly interesting per-
former. To-morrow (Friday) a “grand athletic
night ” is announced in honor of the Lucifers,
when the people who furiously pursue the inflated
sphere with their boots, and the men who whack
the leather globe in the hope of knocking down
three pieces of wood, and the men who get on to a
flat piece of ground and run desperately after
nothing with most of their clothes off, and many
other people, will be present.
** * *
The present programme is doing its last
nights at Sydney Royal, though “Tommy Atkins”
in his fourth week goes with the same vigor as of
yore. Vigor and go are the most conspicuous points
about “ Tommy Atkins.” It is full of large,
robust men who seem to grasp the situation with
both hands, and the spectacle of the Rev. Private
Plimmer rushing to battle is in itself good value
for 4s. Plimmer rushes to battle in a way that
calls for high praise ; and taking people and things
all round, the advt. is less of an Ananias or a
bank auditor—which is practically the same thing
—than usual when it calls the Royal crowd “ the
best dramatic co. in Australia.”
** * *
“A Woman of No Importance ” at Sydney
Criterion ends her rather unimportant career on
Friday. “ A Woman’s Reason ” follows on
Saturday.
A faint suspicion that Knowles has used
up his best jokes and is now getting through his
second-best lot pervades Sydney Palace. Quite a
lot of his latest humors are obtrusi vely venerable,
and one awakes recognition as a Bulletin pro-
duction which this paper gave way to in a weak
moment about ten years ago. Little Miss
Antonio, the three Delevines, and those two
graceful athletes, Wilton and Stack, however,
keep up their reputation for freshness and
originality, and cover a multitude of things, even
including the two people who meet accidentally in
a lunatic asylum and sing to each other, the lady
singist having bright green stockings on. And as
Henry Lee’s realistic representation of Parkes
may be fairly set against the commonplace of two
very ordinary song-and-dance men things are pro-
bably about even.
* * * *
Chirgwin and Charles Godfrey continue to
be the mainstays of Sydney Tivoli, which, so far,
doesn’t appear to be blighted worth a cent by the
opposition show at the Palace. The blight is
pretty well distributed among the big theatres
instead, with rather more of it at the Lyceum
than elsewhere. All the three cinematographes
seem to be doing well enough, and James
M'Mahon’s “ein.”in Pitt-street makes an extra
effort this week with a gorgeous colored view
of the great fountains at Versailles, which piece
of pictorial glitter is about the best thing up to
date.
* * * *
The Edison Vitascope, at 162 Pitt-street,
Sydney, is the Cinematographe Edison-wise. It
has such an attractive programme, with music and
color effects thrown in, that it fetched the clergy,
including two bishops, along the other afternoon
for a special half-hour, and in that thirty minutes
the church soaked up more graceful Annabelle,
more boxer Corbett, more May Irwin’s kissing,
more Amy Muller’s toe-dance, more dog-fight,
more knife-duel, more buck-jump riding, more
bar-room scene, more dance with skirt, and more
dance without skirt than it ever got in at any
previous day and night of its existence. The
Vitascope, therefore, supplies a long-felt want to
people of the highest motives, and the shapeliness
of the many dancers’ legs is a moving lesson in
the triumph of the mind over the body.

Miss Beatrice Griffiths’ farewell-concert
takes place at Sydney Town Hall on the 26th
Governor Hampden and other dignitaries of
great social tonnage propose being present to assist
the songstress on her way, and many good names
are on the programme.

Melbourne shows are much the same as
last week, with the exception of a new horror at
the Alexandra, where the Idiot who flapped his
fins, and said he knew what was going on, has
been superseded by “Not Guilty.” In this case,
the dramatic unities suffered last Saturday from a
general neglect of the company to rush forward at
the right moment. The stage was sometimes
deserted just when the plot ought to have been
thickening, and the curtain seemed on one occa-
sion to descend in a drunk and incapable
manner without waiting for instructions; but,
take it altogether, “Not Guilty” was prefer-
able to the Idiot aforesaid. In addition to about
a dozen principals who appeared to make up their
parts as they went along, it was supported by
three supernumerary convicts at Dartmoor. These
turned up again later as a British army in India.
Also, there was an inexplicable widow. She died
of starvation previous to revelling in enormous
wealth, whereas Augustus Glover, as the villain,
fell a victim to drink ere he took to burglary and
became chief warder at Dartmoor. Glover’s
great aim was to ruin Wilfrid Shine for the
mere sake of witnessing that harmless hero’s
grief, and simply because Shine had given
him a shilling to slake his thirst with, con-
sequently “Not Guilty” might pass as a ser-
mon against promiscuous charity if it were a
more reliable entertainment. But since Saturday,
the company have probably found a few missing
motives, and more likely than not Shine is now a
villain in pursuit of innocent Glover on a charge
of having stolen the widow’s dying child. The
Alexandra struggles include several intelligent,
experienced people who could do very well at im-
provising dialogue around one strong, central idea.
A gruesome, up-to-date idea is all they require.
The Bulletin would suggest an incoherent
mining drama, with the Ballarat leper for princi-
pal chai'acter.

“ Matsa,” at the Princess’s, retains all its
early magnificence, and improves steadily in
other respects. The discovery of a pigmy race
in Africa has already given a strange air of
truth to Little Gulliver and his tribe. A cable-
gram announcing that the Nile is on the rise may
be expected to arrive shortly. Anyway, the Yarra
has risen a good deal during the last fortnight,
therefore the inhabitants of various suburbs where
the kitchen fire gets drowned these damp times
are much concerned about the fate of Matsa’s
naming ballet when the flowing tide comes in.
* * * *
“ Miss Brown” fills the Bijou comfortably,
as usual. Frank Thornton, spinster, will shake
his gory locks at the boarding-school, and fight
the unconvincing detective to a finish in the cow-
shed for another week or two, after which he
leaves for Sydney. The Bijou, by the way, owes
a debt of gratitude to Thornton for having restored
its long-lost popularity by means of a comedy that
makes women laugh without bringing a blush to
the comparatively modest cheeks of their male-
kind. Some of the secret of “Miss Browns”
success must lie in its stern determination not to
be shocking.
* * * *
At Melbourne Royal the remarkable fox-
hunt, likewise the alleged defeat of the wild Boer
are proceeding until further notice. People have
become inured to Walter Baker’s frequent out-
bursts concerning Hingland, and every time the
Glorious Flag makes itself a nuisance they regard
that awful bit of bunting with toleration for the
sake of Bland Holt’s scenery and effects. Miss
Watson being away on sick leave for a few
days, Miss Vivienne has taken her place
in Baker’s stage affections, whilst Miss Grahame
wears the drab, despondent garments of the
girl who went astray. This seems a suitable
time for requesting the management to explain
why its gone-wrong damsels invariably carry the
same brand of shame on their limp walking cos-
tumes—but no matter. Miss Grahame expresses
sorrow for her simple little error in a natural sort
of way, and the fact that she is a slim little lady
with a frail voice amounts to a plea for public
sympathy. This is a cruel world for any poor
young thing who can’t make a formidable show
against the vile majah when he brings his glitter-
ing eye into action.

The Allisons joined Rickards’ force at the
Opera House on Saturday last, and danced them-
selves into considerable favor. Carl Hertz was to
re-appear on Tuesday, for a short season, and the
only Coleman hasn’t gone away. Also, Alice
Leamar’s festive appearance as a red-cross nurse
continues to rob warfare of its terrors for anybody
who would reckon a mortal wound cheap at the
price, if Alice were at hand to take him into her
little tent and kiss the place to make it well.
At Poverty Point.
Dear Bulletin, — Of the many wild and incomprehen-
sible things done in melodrama, the wildest and incom-
prehensiblest is the way the English language is spoken.
There appears to be a special brand of English turned on
there with the red-and-pale-white limelight. I have just
been to see a melodrama, and find it no exception to
the rule. The heroine continually refers to “may hort,”
which means “my heart”; while she rolls her “ fayne
aze,” which is melodramese for “fine eyes.” She says
“may chayld” when she refers to her unfortunate off-
spring. When the hero or the villain says “ Yah 1 ” he is
not derisive : he only means “ hear” in English. There is
an impression in “may maynd” (which, of course, is
my mind) that this jargon is supposed to be associated
with the aecents of the British aristocracy, and is very
“ refayned ” English. I can only say that I prefer the
broad Yorkshire-Scotch mixture of Henry Irving, or the
easy, fluent Yankee of Nat. Goodwin, to that sickening
and impossible speech of the melodramatic stage. And
what the devil do those two clever young male Australians
want “ yahing ” and “ thahtng ” about the stage ? “ May
Gahd, sar, aye lev har dearah than may layfe,” is enough
to give an Australian with a musical ear what one of those
actahs himself would probably call the “graypes”!—
Diogenes.
Actor Bandmann visited Australia and then wrote the
inevitable book. What struck him about Brisbane was
the prevalence of thunderstorms. He says : “Itis no
uncommon thing to see a cab-horse bolting down the
street, the driver having been struck by lightning.”
Melb.: “Delightful old Spiritualist Peebles is back,
the Spectre Bridegroom of the craft, in rusty black, a
‘ Matsa ’ mummy, exhaling the sweet odor of a sandal-
wood coffin. On his last visit, I reported him one Sunday
night, at Melb. Opera House, Chas. Bright chairman.
Bright said, ‘We will now sing a hymn, by Pope.’ An
Irish policeman, on duty with another, near me, turned
to his mate and asked, ‘ Hwhat Poap’s that ? Not Poap
Leo, Oi’ll be bound.’ ”
Melb.: “I don’t know how it is, but they can’t make
‘ Matsa ’ a Johnny piece. Its salacity is most appreciated
by mothers, being ample Gampy-Saxon, not flippety
Gallic enough for Johnny. He just wants to stroke his
walking-cane gently against a brand-new leg.”
Mofussil : “ Gabriel, the freak, the undoubted black
man turned white, exhibiting in Melb., reminds me of
Anglo-Indians, who have turned almost, or quite, the hue
of Hindoos. This is attributable to the action of heat on
the liver, spreading bile through all the blood-ducts —as
it were, currying the man. Gabriel was an at
Adelaide Hospital when he chameleoned, shifted color.”
Cosgrove, trying to change the name of Melb. Aleck to
Her Majesty’s, might have remembered that Rignold
tried the same title at the Opera House.
Nat Goodwin, as was expected, found things rather
warm for him on his return to America. Miss Walsh and
the volatile Dorothy Usner, who dropped out of his Aus-
tralian company when the sisters Elliott came along, re-
turned home with unfavorable reports of Nathaniel’s
doings in the Southern Hemisphere, and now Dorothy is
suing her late manager for libel in that he did explain
her discharge from the co. as being due to incompetence
and indecent conduct. As regards Miss Blanche Walsh,
The Bulletin predicted that she would give Goodwin a
nasty jar. She was the toney lady of the crowd, engaged
to play lead, and at the last moment before leaving
America, her mother suggested to Goodwin that the con-
tract had better be cancelled, seeing that he had then
made arrangements for Maxine Elliott to follow the ex-
pedition. Goodwin, however, anxious not to quarrel
with the Walshes, assured them that Maxine’s advent
would not affect the position of the original leading lad.v.
But it did, of course. As soon as the lovely one came
upon the scene she objected to Miss Walsh’s name “ star-
ring” in the advts. of “ Romeo’s First Love,” and a week
later the young lady sailed back to the Land of the Free
with her ma.
The several versions of the successful Fax and the un-
lucky Goodwin on Australia puzzle America.
Whitburn is the only artist who can. hold his own in
Melb. all the year round, having proved' it with managers

The demised Will South is often confused with his
brother James.
There was not even a pretence of giving Brisbane a
pantomime this season. Local playgoers had their choice
between Dan Barry’s blood-curdlers at the Opera House
and Lawton’s variety show at the Gaiety. Lawton still
holds on.
Mark Hambourg, engaged for the Colonne concerts in
Paris, is steadily widening his circle of admirers, who have
credited him with Rubinstein’s style of execution, abrupt-
ness of method, and singular aptitude for the instrument.
Hambourg is trying to live up to these expectations.

ness at Adelaide and Broken Hill, leave Port Adelaide for

Four puma cubs, a baby llama, six dingo puppies, four
lion cubs, and three Bengal tiger kittens have been born
at bydney Zoo during the last few weeks.
The waltz craze, which for a time possessed Sydney is
disappearing from sight. Miss Maud FitzStubbs set the
ball rolling with her successful “Heather,” and almost
every musically-inclined individual helped to keen it
going. The latest efforts of Sydney’s musical geniuses
have been so ill repaid that waltz-sheets have rapidly

“ What always strikes me is the pathos of the pit,” says
a Hinglish cynic. “That people should patiently wait
outside for an hour or two in the cold to see some of the
shows now being played in London, brings tears to my
sympathetic eyes.” Tiik Bulletin used to think that the
early door for “ A Trip to Chinatown ” was a most affect-
ing spectacle.
The old familiar voice of Newton Griffiths, as an Egyp-
tian person in “ Matsa,” awakens memories of the time
when he used to relate real and imaginary Deeming
atrocities to gaping crowds at Melbourne Waxworks.
Then was Griffiths in his true element. Every week he
would add a new chapter to the awful story, until at last
he stood knee-deep, as it were, in the blood of victims
whom Deeming had never heard of.
May Pollard’s glittering stage jewels are a feature of
“Matsa.” These are her own personal props, a present
from her brother in India, and Miss May feels worth at
least a million sterling when she appears with ’em all on.
It was “ Visor,” of London Weekly Dispatch, who
described Johnel Toole’s Antarctic expedition to Aus-
tralia as a “ glittering triumph.” Now “ Visor ” smooths
the way for Chas. Godfrey’s return, thus : “ I hear that,
notwithstanding his great success at the Antipodes, Mr.
Charles Godfrey is getting a little homesick, and may,
therefore, be expected to be back in London at Easter.”
“ A little homesick ”is distinctly good. But what a com-
fort it sometimes is for the cawlinies that some of the
imported articles have a home to get sick about.
Jack Leete, Rickard’s popular brother-in-law, married
Nita Clarke, one of Harry’s warblers, last week.
Haresfoot: “Successful dramas written and produced
in Australia : Cooper’s ‘ Sunlight and Shadow’ —but that
is not exactly the title ; Garnet Walch’s ‘ Robbery Under
Arms,’ about three of Darrell’s, two out of four or five
adaptations of ‘ His Natural Life.’ I know not if there
be any other that achieved more than a success of esteem,
such as the Vagabond’s ‘No Mercy,’ Bunster’s ‘ Class,’
Marcus Clarke’s ‘ Plot,’ and so forth. Hardly anyone is
aware that an Age journalist, Jaffray, had an original
blank verse tragedy, ‘ The Gladiator,’ produced at Melb.
Royal over 30 years ago.”
H. : “A survey of the all-but-unbroken roll of Christ-
mas pantomimes staged at the Melb. Royal for 41 years—
the only gap was Lyster’s Grand Opera, with Weber’s
Oberon) in 1865—reveals Akhurst, Marcus Clarke, Garnet
Walch, Finn, and other authors, who had the opportunity
of putting in more body than nowadays, since none had
so much expensive paraphernalia crammed in as ‘ Matsa.’
The ear was tickled a bit, while now the eye is made
drunk. Akhurst, who was Herald sub-editor, had a
public sensitive to local history, wherefore his ‘ House
That Jack Built,’ 1869, bore the second title of ‘The Loves
of Jack Melbourne ’ and ‘ Little Victoria,’ while Hennings’
inevitable panorama entranced the audience, with Fawk-
ner’s schooner up the Yarra, on the forest site of the
city.”
Actor Nesbitt’s grave, tombstoned by G. V. Brooke, in
Geelong cemetery, has been beautifully restored, by sub-

In the hunting-scene at Melb. Royal the riders make
their first run from Little Bourke-st. After dropping
down over the miniature waterfall and jumping the
hurdle at the “ wing,” they emerge into the lane that runs
by the side of the theatre, and so back to Lilly Bourke-
st., whence they make a second journey through the
stage-door, and do it all over again. Probably there is no
other theatre in the world where an equestrian troupe
could go hunting with the same effect.
Haresfoot: “ Eric Lewis, London comedian, is engaged
by Williamson and Musgrove, I hear, as nucleus of the
new Comic Opera Co. He is very popular, lithe, and
resembles Arthur Roberts, though more of an eccentric
comedy actor, and sings pleasantly. This looks as i/

Steamship-owners’ secretary A. B. Cock-
burn, prominent in connection with the engineers’

men who hooked payable billets for the asking at
that time included Charles Lyne (now sec. to the

Curnow and T. D. Elwell, also Herald men, both

enquiry.
The Cloneurry country (N.Q.) yields the
latest hideous yarn of death from thirst in the
bush. Sheep-drover John Forbes got stuck up for
water. He sent his man, Thomas Martin, to
search for it. Martin found it, but allegedly
failed to return to Forbes. (The unforgivable
offence m “outside” country.) Forbes’s body
was found dead, with the clothing torn off. Why
men dying of thirst often strip off their clothes
has never been scientifically theorised out. The
bush-traces eloquently told that Forbes had killed
a sheep and drunk its blood. His horse was found
dead four miles from his corpse, and 24,000 sheep
perished ! Another poor devil was found dead in
a dry creek-bed, within half-a-mile of water, only
a few miles from Hughenden.

Treasurer Fysh of Tasmania, deserves a high
place among those whose assurance passes all understand-
ing. Recently The Bulletin drew attention to the fact
that in one year (1895) Tasmania spent *113,000 of bor-
rowed money, and nearly £lll,OOO of this was for works
3' l elded n .° direct return, and which, therefore
should be paid for out of revenue instead of out of
loans From these figures (v h are to be found in
Coghlan s statistics) this papm u-ew the inference that
nance was le us ual kind of swindle, and
that the Tasmanian surplus was the usual kind of bogus
surplus, and that Fysh was the usual kind of Treasurer
that these provinces know so well-only a little more
usual than the average. Treasurer Fysh, at a recent
election meeting:, rose to deny the above fio- ure q tn
say that not £lll,OOO, but less than £3OOO of loan moneys
had gone in non-revenue-producing works in the year
alluded to. Then he produced a list in support
°L S °u le , case - The loan expenditure, as
shown by Fysh, included £54,500 for roads, bridges
dredging- works, &c. ; £3700 for schools ; £4BOO
for miscellaneous public buildings; £1386 for mis-
cellaneous public works including such things
as a quarantine-ground and an embankment beside
a swamp ; £37,300 for loans to local bodies ; and £9lOO
borrowed to cover the expenses of borrowing: a previous
£750,000. These are Fysh’s own figures, and yet Fysh
alleges that only £3OOO of the expenditure was non-
revenue-producing.
Fysh distinctly hangs himself with his own
figures. The road-money expenditure doesn’t produce
any direct revenue, and there is no certain evidence that
it produced any revenue indirectly. Roads are necessary,
like police and soldiers and gaols and lunatic asylums and
many other things, but the fact that they are'necessary
doesn t show that they return even one shilling per cent,
on their cost to the public Treasury. The schools, public
buildings, and miscellaneous works don’t pay the Trea-
sury either. There is no earthly hope of the loan floated
to pay the expenses of floating a previous loan ever
returning any dividends. The only item in Fysh’s con-
tradiction which doesn’t prove the absolute truth of Tub
Bulletin’s statement is the £37,300 for loans to local
bodies, and this is really almost as shady an item as the
rest. The local bodies borrow largely for unproductive
works which should be paid for out of revenue. They
raise the interest by taxation and pay it to the Treasury
—when they do pay it—and the Treasury pays it to the
original lender. The result to the community at large is
just the same in the end as if the Government built the
unproductive works itself and paid the interest out of
taxation. But, leaving this item out, Treasurer Fysh
clearly shows that his Government “blewed” £73,000 in
one year on non-productive works, and after showing
that he did this he denies that he did it.
In this particular direction Tasmania has the
Worst record in all Australia. Victoria spent on roads,
bridges, dredging, fortifications, and assisted immigration
less than one-fiftieth of its total borrowed money ; N.S.W.
spent one-ninth ; Queensland fully one-fifth ; S.A. one-
sixth ; Westralia one-fifth ; Tasmania no less than one-
third. This is saying nothing of a mysterious outlay
classed as “ miscellaneous,” and Tasmania has spent
a larger proportion of its borrowed money on “mis-
cellaneous” than any other Australian province. Only
half of Tasmania’s borrowings has gone in reproductive
works ; the rest has been spent to save the magnates of
the land of Lots of Sleep from being taxed sufficiently to
make the country pay its way. The result is that the
interest on the public debt in Tas. swallows up a far larger
proportion of the total revenue than in any other province;
that more of the interest has to be made up out of taxa-
tion than in any other province, because less of it is
revenue-producing ; and that the province has to fake its
accounts even worse than the others by spending a larger
proportion of its new borrowings on works which should
be paid for out of revenue, in order to disguise the fact
that it is even more insolvent than its neighbors. And
no amount of Fysh can get away from these facts.

Sydney municipality has just floated a per
cent, loan of £150,000 locally at 99. The best price at
which the Sydney Council has ever borrowed in London
was 4 per cent., and a considerable amount of its British
indebtedness carries 5 and 5J per cent, interest. Conse-
quently the local market pans out remarkably well by
comparison. Mayo? Ives reckons that even if London
would have taken a per cent, loan at par (1 per cent,
above the local price), when flotation expenses and the
cost of remitting interest are considered the results would
show a balance of £5693 in favor of the local market —
which means 3s. per cent, per annum saved by the present
method.

A brief telegram from Brisbane says that the
Queensland National Bank has postponed its half-yearly
meeting until after the reconstruction proposals are laid
before the shareholders—probably some time in February.
It is vaguely reported that the arrangement is getting on
all right; and, meanwhile, it appears that the half-year
has ended with a loss of £1607. As every other half-year
since the reconstruction ended with an alleged profit, this
is presumably the result of the recent investigation.
When the overhaul took place it was reported that a con-
siderable amount of the profits were bogus—arrived at by
charging in the books interest which couldn’t be recovered
on advances which were either lost or partly lost, and
reckoning the same as if actually received. If the present
telegraphed results are any criterion, it would seem that
the net profits were wholly bogus ; at all events, the last
balance-sheet before that investigation showed an alleged
net profit of over £lO,OOO, which was not much below the
average, and the first one after it shows a sudden drop of
£11,600 and a dead loss. Whether the £1607 is the whole
loss, or whether the board is still taking a sanguine view
of things and there are more revelations to follow, is
another question. The board talks of submitting the re-
construction scheme to the shareholders and getting their
approval, but very little is said about how the approval of
the depositors—who are the really interested parties—is
panning out. If they, and especially the British section
of them, don’t approve, the shareholders amount to
nothing.

The Royal Bank of Queensland presents its
Usual solid-looking balance-sheet. Profits for the half-
year are £6515, as compared with £6455 and £6033 for the
two previous periods. A 2>4 per cent, dividend and
dividend tax thereon account for £4922 ; £l5OO is added
to reserve, making it £33,000, and the remaining £93,
added to previous balance, leaves £3271 at credit of profit
and loss. The deposits (£735,000) are an increase of
£16,000 during the half-year ; and coin, bullion, Govern-
ment securities and Treasury notes show £275,000 of cash
°. r i 1? equivalent in hand —equal to 33 per cent, of all
liabilities to the public. The Royal has lately released
another instalment of its reconstructed deposits, making
in all 50 per cent, released, and the money has been re-
deposited so freely at a lower rate of interest that the
total deposits have increased rather than diminished,
while the liquid assets have also increased very largely.
Considering its remarkably strong position it seen s cer-
tain the Royal could set free the other half of its recon-
structed money in one act without the slightest risk, and
thus gain considerably in prestige while making a solid
saving in interest.
The wisdom of that clause in its reconstruction
scheme, by which the Royal Bank of Queensland pledged
itself to carry a quarter of its profits to a reserve and to
invest that reserve separately in State securities,
f r ; c ,'’ s more and more apparent. It has provided the
S ntl ® w>th a reserve of £33,000 which otherwise
ouia probably have pone in paying- another 1 per cent.
Bn. cent - dividend. In proportion to its size the

The new Victorian Companies Act, despite all
the emasculation effected by the Leg. Council, is a
measure of some value, and the action of the Turner
Government m accepting what there was of it in the hope
getting more later on, instead of standing on its
ignity and wrecking the whole measure, seems reason-
abie enough. Under the new order of things, auditors
must be licensed as an evidence of competence ; no person
can act as auditor if he owes money to the institution
audited ; no director or other employs can be an auditor
while in the co. s employ or for 12 months after leaving
it, and auditors are made responsible for the accuracy of
the books, whereas heretofore they have only been called
upon to state that the balance-sheet agrees with the books
without saying whether the books agree with facts or not.
the balance-sheet must show the amount of paid-up capi-
tal,, and how much is paid up respectively in cash or
p/n s or other alleged securities; amounts due to the
co., after allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts ;
whether assets are taken at cost price or at valuation ;
the amount written off for depreciation ; the amount, if
an -V, written-up on the assets; how the reserve-fund is
invested, and sundry other things. Any objection made
by the auditors is to be reported to the shareholders, in-
stead of privately to the directors, as has generally been
done heretofore. No company is allowed to have any lien
on its own shares, except for calls, which breaks up the
practice of companies lending on their own shares.
Loans to managers, auditors, or employes, or firms
in which they have an interest, are prohibited, like-
Wls ® ttie payment of dividends except out of
profits. The amount of any mortgage upon the
uncalled capital must be published, and the assets or the
uncalled capital cannot be mortgaged except by resolu-
tion of the shareholders. Directors are prohibited from
selling their own properties to their own companies—a
regulation which, if it had existed 10 or 12 years ago,
would have knocked the bottom out of nearly every boom
land-bank in Melbourne. No institution can, in future,
call itself a bank or savings bank unless it has at least
£200,000 subscribed and £75,000 paid-up capital, and is
also specially authorised by Parliament to use the title.
Also, no company can commence business or borrow
money until at least one-twelfth of its capital is paid up.
There are a number of other provisions, but these are
the ones which are most calculated to make the company-
boomer sit up suddenly.

The City Bank of Sydney reports that its net
profits for the half-year ended 31st December are £BO7l
against £BlOB, £10,019, £10,030, and £10,004 for four pre-
vious six-monthly periods. A 4 per cent, dividend
absorbs £BOOO, and the remaining £7l, added to £BlBB
previously on hand, leaves £8259 to carry forward. The
quaint feature about the City Bank’s profit balance is that
it is always just enough to pay an even dividend and leave
a very few pounds over—so very few that the coincidence
is altogether remarkable. In the days when a 5 per
cent, dividend absorbed £lO,OOO, the earnings were so
exactly £lO,OOO that the total surplus for three half-
years onlj r amounted to £54. When the dividend went
down to 4 per cent. (£8000), the profits also dropped so
accurately that the surplus in two half-years is only
£179. Barring the fact that 4 per cent, is a ver3 r small
dividend, and that if the steady shrinkage continues
even it will soon be a matter of difficulty, and that the
balance-sheet gives the smallest amount of information
on record, there is nothing specially bad about the
present report. Deposits and note circulation
have increased slightly. Cash on hand has in-
creased by no less than £71,000, and now amounts
to the large sum of £334,ooo—equal to over 30
per cent, of the liabilities. That vasty item of
obscurity, “ Bills and all other Debts due to the
Bank,” which accounts for everything that isn’t cash or
office premises, remains about the same. The City Bank
is a small concern which never seems to get any larger or
any more vigorous, and as it has only got £406 ahead in
3J4 years, its career seems pretty uneventful. During
the same period the reserve has gone down from £219,000
to £lOO,OOO, and the prospect of ever getting it up again
at the present rate of progress isn’t worth speaking about.

The alleged advantages of private enterprise in
the matter of railway-building are again illustrated in
Westralia, where the Government has bought the Great
Southern line from its embarrassed owners for £1,100,000.
The line thus costs the State £4525 per mile in cash.
The co. also received nearly 3,000,000 acres of land, and
if this was worth even 7s. an acre the whole cost to the
State is £9050 a mile. The lines built by the State cost
on an average £3804 per mile. Therefore, the advantages
of leaving the work to the much-lauded private enterprise
are that it cost about £1,200,000 extra; that it was a
ceaseless worry, and a subject of political intrigue ; that
the private co. went broke, whereas the Govt, railway
S3'stem in W.A. not only pays working expenses and in-
terest, but 3 T ields an actual profit; and that the fares on
the private line while it was in the company's hands were
higher than the rates charged by the State. (As examples:
Government lines—Perth to Bunbury, 115 miles, second-
class fare, 125.; private lines —Midland Junction to Coom-
berdale, 110 miles, second-class fare, 13s. 9d.; Beverley to
Yaraben, 113J4 miles, second-class fare, 14s. 3d.) There
doesn’t seem to be anything great in all this for private
enterprise to brag about. A private railway under purely
local management and run with local capital might
pay. The private railway which is bossed in London
never does, for directors, managers, experts, boodlers,
first-robbers, office expenses, commissions, brokerages,
and all manner of other swindles in London cost more
than the railway itself.

The balance-sheet of the New Zealand Insurance
Go. (fire and marine) shows that the net premium income
for the 3'ear just closed was £283,973, the biggest record
up to date. Losses and expenses absorbed over £273,000,
and the year’s profit is £29,097, of which £18,900 is from
interest on investments. The 12J per cent, dividend and
of 6d. per share absorb £27,500, so there remain
£1597 to strengthen the company's position. Said posi-
“O" ls alread -y remarkably strong, the N.Z. 00. having
£-00,000 paid-up capital, £235,000 reserves, and £14,000
balance to credit of profit and loss, and its £434,000 of
investments show the remarkably good return of over
4J per cent, per annum. And despite the fact that the
co. has earned its big dividend and bonus and a little over,
the past year ranks as a much worse one than usual in
its experiences.

wine and spirit firm has just “gone ’’ in London for £9OOO
odd. Assets, £36. Since 'B4 the gentleman is stated to

lately. The dukes, generals, and admirals who used to
live on the guinea-pig industry must have all made their
piles on Westralian mine-flotations and retired from the
profession.

The change that has taken place in the charac-
ter of ore available and in the methods of treatment
adopted at Broken Hill is shown by comparing the
exports for the last three years. Thus
. , ' 1894. 1895. 1896.
Ore and concentrates £644,896 £587,255 £953,861
Bulll °n £1,543,038 £959,562 £788,530
Totals ... ... £2,187,934 £1,546,817 £1,742,391
The totals do not show quite the full value of the mineral
exports, because a quantity of copper matte, and in some
years a small quantity of silver ingots, have been sent
away. But the figures do show the rapidity with which
the smelting ores have declined in value, partly owing to
the fall in the price of silver and partly owing to the
reduced metallic value of the ore ; at the same time,
though, they show the rapid increase during 1896 in the
export of ore and concentrates—mostly now, of course,
sulphides. During 1897 the value of the bullion is not
likely to fall below £600,000 (though 1898 may see a much
bigger fall), while the value of ore and concentrates is
likely to go to close upon £1,400,000. The Central alone,
on present appearances, will add a-quarter of a million to
the total.

Silverton Tram Co. has entered into an agree-
ment for a period with the Barrier companies, and has
followed the S.A. railways in substantial reductions for
the carriage of carbonate ore and coal (from 4s. Bd. to
3s. 3d), sulphide ore and concentrates, firewood, salt,
flux, lead, and matte (4s. to 3s. 3d.); bullion (7s. 9d. to
65.). Freights of coke and mine-timber remain the same,

laide—sl2 tons for 55190 z. smelted gold, an average of

Broken Hill Ore Recovery Co.: “Ore despatched

Much —a little too much —is being printed about
the wonderful prospects of the Mt. David mine, formerly
known as the Mt. Maude, near Rockley, N.S.W. Total
stone crushed to date : 105 tons for 2700 z. Average,
2oz. lldwt. per ton. Good enough if it can be maintained,
and it will probably want it all to pay on a capital of
£120,000. The fact that Messrs. Knox and Schlapp had a
working bond on this property for several months and yet
did not buy it, is not considered worth mentioning in the
glowing descriptions the public will soon tire of reading.
Let the battery do the talking.
Ructions are promised at the next B.H. South
meeting. The Adelaide push want the management—
undercurrent. Block 14 is starving for the South ore,
and cannot work its game there till the cute Melb. crowd
is stifled. Block 14 has no more British ore to make
divs. from, and the South, properly engineered in the
skypilot city, would make another sweet lamb to skin.

Perhaps the most promising N.S.W. gold-mine,
says a local correspondent, is the Royal Standard, at
Stewart’s Brook, one of the tributaries of the Upper
Hunter. It has broken two companies, but the present
seems to be destined to make up for past losses. The
reef has been worked for 500 ft. from the surface down-
wards, at which level it was met by an adit, driven from
the foot of the hill, and gave from loz. to 7oz. per ton.
In the upper levels, the reef was small and irregular, in
hard diorite formation, whioh, near the adit, turns into
kindly black slate, carrying an 18in. reef. A winze is now
being sunk from the adit, exposing a rich body of stone.
Last month’s crushing of 110 tons yielded over soz. per
ton, but, as the stone contains large quantities of arseni-
cal pyrites, and is treated at an ordinary battery, without
concentrating or grinding appliances, the concentrates
may be reckoned to be worth at least another soz. per ton.
* * * *
The official Vic. gold-return for 1896 is 805,0870 z.
—65,0010 z. above the yield for 1895, and the largest
since 1882; it exceeds by 228,6880 z. the 1891 return.
In other words, gold to the value of £900,000
more was obtained during the last twelve months
than for the corresponding period five years ago, and the
yield for 1897 is expected to total more than that of any
one of the previous 20 years, and to approach, if not
surpass, that of 1876, when the quantity won was over
900,0000 z. The quantity won during the last quarter
alone in Victoria was only between 10,000 oz. and 15,0000 z
less than the total estimated yield in Westralia for the
whole of 1896. The total Vic. gold-yield since 1851 is esti-
mated at 60,991,4080 z., equal in value to £243,865,632.

The 180 is once more readying up to fill Bendigo
reefer Lansell’s profit eye. Payable milling from the
extension of the Vic. quartz reef at 2500 ft., while the
3200 ft. crosscut has discovered a Oft. reef and a 25ft.
thick spurry formation that promises well. Odds are that
Lansell will pile up a second £lOO,OOO from the 180.
Deserves it all. Since the last reef petered, deep sinking
and exploring has mopped up close on £70,000. Where is
there another man in Australia who would placidly sink
that sum in prospecting a region as hot as sheol?
* * * *
Johnson’s Reef (Bendigo) sees a more hopeful
future. Foot reef on the Nelson shaft should mill well
this term, and thus ease stockers of the heavy expense
in sinking the No. 1 shaft the 500 ft. to go to permit
intersecting the Windmill Hill reef. The adjacent
Princess Dagmar also has a decent prospect this half. A
crosscut at 2235 ft. expects to pick up the reef, and if
that is so, a lower one at 2335 ft. will prove its quality.
Better indications, too, at the 780 ft. level.
* * * *
Hustler’s shows (Bendigo) are in trouble. Bar-
ring Lansell’s Comet, the only div. mine of the group is
the United Hustlers, and that doesn’t seem to have a
much longer profit life in tow. Hustler’s No. 1, about
which the Sabbath tipster used to whoop, has had a dull
time, and the co. is just getting into line to develope the
Comet run of dirt. The old Hustler’s Reef out of luck.

Stewart’s United Ellesmere (Vic.) has a cheap
mining record. Past half’s milling : 4911 tons for 7670 z.
16dwt., averaging about 3dwt. ; yet it carried on a deal of
development work and paid £l2OO divs. Takes beating.
Two other local shows are squeezing out profits from
equally low-"’•ade dirt.

Prospectus of Melbourne United Gold Mining
Co. appears in this issue for “information only.” The
property, consisting of 18 acres, adjoining the White
Horse and Queen Margaret (W.A.), was floated privately
by Randolph Bedford, and, judging from the haste with
which certain wide-awake people chipped into the new
spec, as soon as it had “ gone off,” the M.U.G. M. Co. has
a future of some sort. A market future, or a divi-
dend ditto, or both. The show starts with favorable
reports from the managers of the Margaret and the Ivan-
hoe, and £BOOO working capital. An early crushing (by
arrangement with the Bulong Co.) of some 1500 tons
already available, is, it is asserted, more or less likely to
go 3oz. or better ; and if it does, shareholders may count
upon a long immunity from calls.
Melbourne United directorate has three names
that spell luck and attract punters—H. H. Drysdale and
Alec Campbell (of the Ivanhoe), and Agar Wynne, M.L.0.,
who is taking up a lot of shares. Randolph Bedford,
being the happy father of 32,000 shares, joins the board
on allotment, and, if the property comes up to expecta-
tions, that many-sided young human whirlwind will
probably issue the first half-yearly report in verse. Two
distinct persons—the mine-promoter and the Australian
bard—are ever fighting for supremacy beneath Randolph
B.’s shirt front, so it will all depend upon which of them
may be uppermost at the critical moment.
After the aforesaid float comes Melbourne
United North, which is about to be launched in Sydney
on Federation-market principles, The Bulletin supposes.
This sort of thing tends to create a community of interest
between the two provinces, although it may not always
produce much real interest for the communities.

According to Q. Government Geologist Jack,
“ the mountains of purely specular and magnetio iron
ore” that he noticed in the Cloncurry district (Gulf

if the said mines were in England. When Cloncurry is
liberated from its present isolation by railway communi-
cation with either Cairns, Townsville, or Normanton, its
day of prosperity will come. It has long been known as
the richest metalliferous district in all Queensland. But
it has been nearly all collared in advance, although the

The social column of a recent Melb. Herald
begins:—
By the sad accident at Dunkeld, which resulted in the
death of Mrs. Silas Harding, Melbourne society loses one
of its wealthiest members. The deceased lady was ex-
pected to entertain very largely during the coming
season.
That gratitude which is a lively sense of favors to
come obviously prompted the kindly notice of the
obituarist, who yet hopes to be invited to a garden-
party in the Isles of the Blest, under the patronage
of the Archangels and their aides-de-camp. The
moral is that, if you are rich and are prompted to
entertain the Nicest people, don’t. Instead, give
blankets to the blacks and distribute tobacco at
the Benevolent Asylum.
THAT TERRIBLE INFANT.
DORIS (aged 4 ): “The dressmaker can’t get my new dress to fit me. What do you do, Uncle
Charlie, when she can’t get your trousers to jit properly?”—(Unde Charlie asks
hurriedly for the “ Mustard , please!”)
Geelong, where old Silas Harding built up
his colossal reputation for stinginess, seems to
have reaped considerable benefit from his estate,
after all. The local hospital committee has
decided to erect a tablet commemorating the late
(and second) Mrs. Harding’s charitable acts to the
institution. The first Mrs. Harding—poor crea-
ture ! —is not commemorated anywhere, except in
ancient anecdotes of the bad time she enjoyed
with Silas, when he was a comparatively young
and vigorous skinflint. One story relates that her
husband, forced to bring the doctor to her because
she couldn’t continue her daily round of domestic
slavery, was advised to supply her with more food.
Whereupon Silas went forth scowling to buy a
pound of steak and other necessaries for the
patient partner of his fortunes. No matter, the
second wife’s lavish expenditure must have made
his soul wriggle a bit.

G.D. : “ They think George Goulet, AT,
is a condiment at Woods Point. After 30 hours
in train and coach, I was treating myself on Box-
ing Day to a small bottle of ‘The Boy.’ Oppo-
site sat Jim and Bill drinking billy-tea in a sore-
heady fashion. Sez Jim : ‘ Tomatty sos, Bill ? ’
‘Doan’ mind,’ sez Bill. Jim helped Bill to sauce
out of my bottle, and as it began to sizzle over the
corn-beef and cabbage Bill remarked sententiously:
‘ The blanky stuff’s gone bad, Jim ! ’ ”
Melb. : “I was at the Wesleyan Central
Mission meeting, last week. One brother gave a
lamentable case of a young man two days without
food or lodging. Amid the groans of ‘ Ah-h !’ it
struck someone to ask ‘ Why didn’t he go to Our
Shelter?’ The Brother: ‘He said he would
sooner sleep out.’ ”

The irony of it: “A number of ladies
visited the Benevolent Asylum and Home
of Hope, and an enjoyable time was spent by
the inmates.” Most of the long-nosed ladies
who visit ’omes and worry the unfortunates
for full particulars and detailed accounts of
their “ fall ” are calculated to give an enjoyable
time to anybody. But then the miserable inmate
can’t rise and explain frankly how much she
wishes that all the crowd was in Gehenna. The
inspected one has to look joyful under all manner
of circumstances.

The lady turned.

she gasped sav-
agely, seizing the

wards the tram-

bumped hard

A sidelight was lately cast on the ways
and means of the Australian metropolitan “mis-
sions ” during the hearing of a vagrancy charge at
Melb. City Court. A respectable woman, who
had vainly endeavored to get work, was found
lying on the steps of a church, and on her being
ushered into court, one of the sisters of the Wes-
leyan mission came forward and offered to take
the poor woman into their home. The woman
concurred, and the bench was about to order a
discharge when the “ nun ” remarked that the rule
of the Home was that inmates were to do nine
months’ work without pay—situations to be sup-
plied at the end of that period. The prospect of
three-quarters of a year’s hard labor “on the
nod ” made accused open her eyes, and, deciding
that she “wouldn’t take any,” she informed the
court that she preferred that they should go ahead
with the sentence. This they did, awarding the
unfortunate one month. One of the leading lights

On the night of Jan. 8 and morning of
Jan. 9 three-quarters of an inch of rain fell at
Broken Hill in steady, soaking showers ; 24 hours
before this one-quarter inch had fallen. At noon
on Jan. 9—within less than nine hours of the
time the rain had ceased—a blinding dust-storm
was raging. The clouds were so thick that it was

impossible to see from one side of the street to
the other. The storm was not confined to the
Hill. Ten miles out, on the plains, where the
rainfall had been still heavier, the dust was
equally thick. A homestead lessee, out repairing
his dam (the intake embankment had been washed
away that morning) had to knock off to escape
suffocation. This is not the first experience of the
kind in the district.

One result of Melbourne’s latest gale was
to show that the young trees along St. Kilda-rd.
had been planted without thought for the mor-
row. They were not put far enough into the light
soil, consequently the surface roots have no hold,
and, now that their branches are spreading, a
well-directed gust of wind blows them down to an
angle of 45. Tree-planting, as a rule, shows very
little regard for age developments. In private
gardens one finds saplings placed in positions
which doom them to destruction as nuisances here-
after.

The Herald is a paper published every day in
Sydney
Which utters dreary platitudes in very dreary
style: .
Its lights are Nonconformist —Congregational its
kidney—
And its liver suffers badly from accumulated
bile.
The father of the Herald is a superfine arch-
angel;
Its mother was a lady of the Very Nicest class ;
And it follows any persons witli the slightest moral
mange ’ll
Be warned out of the Herald if they walk upon
the grass.
The Herald is so moral that when public men
who sin with
Strange women get divorces at seven a.m. sure
It never dreams of saying nasty things ; for, to
begin with,
That doesn’t pay —and then, you see, the Herald
is so pure.
When any play by Oscar Wilde is staged at the
Criterion
The Herald will not mention him : his name it
can’t endure.
It hears he is a satyr, and it knows itself
Hyperion:
The Herald is so moral—the Herald is so
pure.
If the Herald had been there when other Phari-
sees escorted
The woman in adultery to Jesus for a cure
It would have thrown a stone, but it would never
have reported
An incident so shocking to the moral and the
pure.
The Herald’s knee may bow in church : its judg-
ment ne’er consenteth
To the doctrine of salvation for the pauper and
the boor:
The Herald’s God has mercy for the sinner that
repenteth,
But the Herald is more moral—the Herald is
more pure.

“ The Patents, Trade Marks and Copyright
Laws form one of the most complicated branches
of legal science.” This is true, and it is practi-

their technicalities to draw specifications and
claims, &c., that will stand the test of a law-suit.

simply prohibitive to most inventors, but Mr.

street (next Hotel Australia), Sydney, and Bolton-
street, Newcastle, having established reciprocal
arrangement with leading Patent agents in all the
principal countries in the world is now prepared
to do the work accurately and effectively at rates
that will place a patent within reach of the poorest
inventor. For the sum of £2O (exclusive of cost of
drawings) he will obtain a certificate of Provisional
Protection (in the first instance) for any invention
in the seven Australasian colonies and Great
Britain, and full Patents all over the world at
similarly reasonable rates. Mr. Griffith also

Australian lighthouse-keepers, as a rule,

Cape Otway seems an exception, as one man made

now provides a State school as a lighthouse
adjunct. The Solitary Island lighters amuse

A Sydney advertiser’s little joke :
THE MOUNTAIN MYSTERY.
Lee Weller Carried
’S DISINFECTANT.
It did not save his life, but kept him healthy.
Ugh ! But this ghastly advt. is not much worse
than the publicity-dodge of most people who had
anything to do with the Glenbrook corpse-hunt.
Whilst detectives often re-
cognise ex-gaol-birds by their cat-
like movements, the D.’s them-
selves can be recognised just as
easily by the peculiarly of their
gait, together with their custom
of hunting in couples. The writer,
the other day, though just returned
after five years’ absence from Syd-
ney, singled out a pair of re-
cently-made D.’s by reason of the
ambling goose-step and the im-
mense undentsndings developed
by every police - force fledgling.
When you meet two men together,
each with the same amble and the
same la:ge feet and the same ob-
trusive air of unobtrusiveness,
nobody can help recognising the
typical detect've at a glance. The
air of desperate unobtrusiveness is
the result of previous training in
the uniform force. The ordinary
policeman learns to loom up like a
tower at the street corner, where
he can command a view of his
“bate” either way. Then he is
made a D., and finds that it is his
duty to conceal himself as much as
possible, wherefore he becomes a
large, conspicuous man with a
slink,.and looks as if he was Chang
trying to hide behind himself on
the Old Man Tlain.

The portrait herewith represents Miss
Beatrice Griffiths, one of Kowalski s brightest
pupils, and a lady well-known in Sydney musical
circles. Miss Griffiths is shortly to be tendered a
benefit by her many admirers with a view to
helping her on her way to Europe, where all good
Australians go, there to complete her musical
education. When it is completed the opinion of
those who know her best is that Miss Griffiths
will be one of the cleverest musicians that Aus-
tralia has yet produced, and this country,
considering its youth and other disadvantages,
has not done so badly in that branch of art.

la answer to a correspondent’s question as
to the derivation of “robbo” (Sydney slang for
the vehicle ordinarily called a “sulky”) “J.P.”
writes as follows (his explanation looks the most
likely of about 20 which have reached The Bul-
letin) :
“ Four Bob Robbo ” —four shillings Robinson. Robin-
son, who lived in the classic suburb of Waterloo, Sydney
(probably so called because most of the residents have
long since discarded Wellingtons and Bluchers), came
into a bit of money and bought a horse and trap. The
money was spent, and Robinson tired of feeding the
horse, which got poor; so he then sometimes let out the
horse and trap (both somewhat worse of wear) for 4s. per
half-day. There was a run on the cheap hire, and Rob.
bought two other horses and traps, which he let out
at same price. A neighboring livery-stable keeper
and his employes resented Rob’s cutting-down prices,
and, when any of the rival’s equipages passed, used to
cry out, in derision, “ Four Bob Robbo ! ” The cry was
taken up by the kids, and has now become a Waterloo
classic. It has already cost one person ±'2 and costs, the
magistrate ruling that “Four Bob Robbo !’’ shouted after
the original in the street, constituted insulting language
calculated to create a breach of the peace. Verb. sap.
Another correspondent remarks that
If you desire to hear some ornate blasphemy, tell a
Sydney bottle-merchant, that his turn-out is a ‘ four bob.’
You will get four shillingsworth. “Robbo” has in
an extensive Sydney circle come to mean anything un-
satisfactory. For instance, a girl enters a jeweller’s shop
with : “ Whatcher been givin’ us ? Look at the clasp of
this ’ere bracelet I bought of yer last week. It’s gone
bung already. It’s a fair robbo.”
Yerily an illustration of the devious ways of ety-
mology, for few people would hesitate to believe
that “robbo” was a near relation to “robbery.”
Also “robbo” has come to mean amateur : a well-
known amateur cross-country horseman who is a
personal favorite with the professional steeplechase
jocks., when he went out to ride in a ’chase, the
other day,. was amiably greeted with, “ Hello,
Robbo—going ter break yer bloomin’ neck.”

Several of the men off the warships now
at Hobart have “ broken leave,” and the usual
“ rewards ” of All, and in one case £3, have been
offered for their arrest. Which recalls a Hobart
incident of some years ago. A “mid” off a war-
ship then in port had broken leave, a reward was
offered for his arrest, and the police were on the
qui vive. One day a boat suddenly shot out
from the wharf and pulled rapidly for the war-
ships. A police-boat was soon in hot chase and
rapidly gained on the waterman and the aforesaid
“mid.” At last the “bobbies” came alongside
and called on the mid. to surrender; but the
mid. suddenly jumped up in the boat and drove
the butt-end of his oar clean through the planking
of the police-boat. Nothing daunted, however,
the police, keeping one of their number baling,
continued the chase and again caught up to the
waterman just as he reached the landing-stage on
the warship : but it was too late —the mid. was on
deck in no time, and a grinning marine with a
fixed bayonet met the eager detective who had
bounded up the ladder. The chase was seen
from the warships and the shore, and the cheering
on both sides was tremendous.

All industry of which very little has been
heard so far has just been discovered on a rather
large scale in Melbourne. In that city the man
who wants to pass the Civil Service or any other
examination, and who has doubts about getting
through, hires a person to wear his name for the
time being and pass for him. His double, having
probably passed half-a-dozen times already, can
guarantee to get through, and his charges being
moderate it is a very comforting arrangement for
all parties concerned.
A Bulletin correspondent draws attention
to the hours during' which the so-called “ appren-
tice clerks” in N.S.W. Railway Dept, allegedly
work. Their duties begin at 9 a.m., and they are
permitted to leave when the work is finished—
often as late as 8 and 9 p.m., for which no extra
pay is allowed. Even the much-maligned private
employer will allow “tea-money” for overtime
work, but' the Railway Dept, does not. Eleven
and twelve hours a day is too much to expect
from youths just leaving school.

Brisbane (Q.) Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, which has just dispensed
with the services of an inspector because, in his
zeal for ferreting out information, he frequently
knocked out himself, considers that its functions
embrace a very wide scope. In its dictionary,
“cruelty to animals” means cruelty to dogs,
horses, children, parents, wives, and. everything
aliv.e. It embraces moral and mental as well as
physical cruelty. Its scope of definition includes
anything that can be squeezed by any artifice
of logic whatever under the all-pervading authority
of the self-appointed Gimlet Society. A hideous
revelation has scummed up to the surface of public
scandal in Brisbane, as part of the bubbling
ferment Caused by the inspector’s resignation. It
is whispered every whei-e that, at the time of that
resignation, no less than 25 names were listed to
certain police authorities as those of persons under
surveillance for suspected incest. .

Hobart rejoices in having the offices of
Police Magistrate and Commissioner of Police and
Commissioner of the Court of Requests combined
in one man. Loud and continuous were the mur-
murings when this little arrangement was made,
but they gradually subsided —till this little inci-
dent again fanned the flame of indignation : On
15th Dec. one of the constables pleaded
guilty to cruelly ill treating a horse. The Police
Magistrate and a J.P. (one of the police commit
tee) fined him ss. with 7s. fid. costs !

A hairless tract his scalp displayed
Th at shone so brightly ;
“ Alas ! ” he grumbled to the maid,
“ You deem me ancient, I'm afraid,
And mock me rightly ;
My baldness tells of youth decayed."
His tone teas sad, his bearing staid,
But she laughed lightly.
“ With craft matured I can employ
A tongue beguiling,
And if your mood be chastely coy
I talk of love sans lust alloy —

But though you feign a sober joy
You can't regard me as your boy."

She smooths her suitor's time-worn face.
With hands caressing :
“ I'm sick of hoys who ‘ go the pace ; ’
Your heart is young in any case,
And that's a blessing.
A loss of hair is no disgrace ”

Her warm mouth pressing.
She pouts the lips that lately kisst
The bald-head gleaming ,
And — well, of course, he can't resist:
Misgivings fade like morning mist
’Neath icarm sunbeaming,
His Ungers clutch her pulsing wrist,
The old man's thoughts can still consist
With love's young dreaming.

The old girls are never old ;

And their cheeks defy the dial.

Now, who ventures a denial ?

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, Jan. 19, 1897.
My Dear Myee—
The P.A. Yacht Club’s annual festive outbreak
happened on Wednesday evening, when the
steamer Alathea was filled at the Quay by a joyous
crowd, accompanied by a vigorous band and
cheered by thoughts of refreshments. The com-
modore and family were taken on board at Darling
Point in an outbreak of colored fire, rockets, and
fire balloons, and the cornet came out strong in
“ He’s a jolly good fellow.” Club magnates were
identified by their uniform caps and the bronzing
that comes from braving the dangers of the mighty
deep every Saturday half-holiday on the ’arbor. A
concert was given by an amateur tenor, who war-
bled well, a comic singer with a loud, clear voice,
and popular selections were played by the band,
which mercifully omitted “Ben Bolt’’and “Para-
dise Alley,” but couldn’t resist having its fling at
the “ Intermezzo.” Sustenance was handed round
in trays.
Colombo is booming just now as a fashionable
resort with opulent travellers from this side, who
arrange to stop over at the chief hotel in Ceylon’s
Isle on their way ’Ome, and in the time acquire
usefully aristocratic Anglo-Indian acquaintances
whose names they can air when they continue
their voyage, and so paralyse their “colonial”
friends who are ignorant of the social distinctions
of India’s coral strand. A local aspirant to higher
spheres of Niceness is expressing her intention of
exporting herself and grown-up daughters to Cey-
lon for the coming cold weather “because one
meets such Nice People at the hotel there.”
A well-known lady has got herself into quite an
accumulation of worry through good-naturedly
chumming with a clever, and apparently charm-
ing, girl on her way per mail-steamer to visit Aus-
tralia professionally. Having given the actress a
vague invitation to come and see her in Sydney,
she felt no qualms at anything she observed on
board, noting only that her friend had very fine
eyes and a knack of acquiring men friends. But,
after she had been long enough at home to learn
all the current gossip, she heard “things” about
the charmer that made her flee to the uttermost
parts of the mountains to avoid the consequences
of her invitation. Then the actress, after quarrel-
ling with her manager, returned home, and
told startling and original stories to the relations
and friends of the woman who had been too kind-
hearted to snub her, and who had originally been
“ raised ”in the same parts. And amazed rela-
tives write out agonised appeals to know if these
things are true.
The W.C.T.U. is preparing to welcome a new
lecturer from the TJ.S. At a meeting held last
week, the executive committee resolved that a
welcome be “ accorded ” to the enterprising purity
preacher, but cautiously added a rider “ that no
monetary responsibility be undertaken.” His
welcome will probably be endorsed : “Every care
taken but no responsibility.”
A Sydney girl was taken away to Westralia last
week by the marriage of Miss Rosalie Conway to
Mr. Strelitz, who is settled in Fremantle. Another
wedding of the week which takes the bride away
from her native heath was Mr. D. M. Barry, son
of a Melb. gilded citizen, to Miss Frances Tib-
betts, daughter of the popular Gunning doctor.
While a male school inspector was examining
sewing the other day, and trying to look wise
about it, a lady teacher handed up a specimen of
work to the inspector, remarking, “ This is very
poor,” with which dictum the great man agreed
at once. She continued to criticise every piece
till she reached the last, over which she went into
ecstacies —the inspector sharing her raptures. The
teacher had artfully taken up the first garment
once more and palmed it off as a masterpiece of
workmanship.
Bicycles create camaraderie and break down pre-
liminary stiffness, besides flying or wheeling dead
in the face of Mrs. Grundy. Two girls with
bicycles were standing outside Melb. Govt. House
gates waiting for the relay-ride despatch carrier to
arrive, but were in doubt if he would come in by
that gate. One of them suggested consulting the
sentry. “Not much,” remarked the other, “if a
fellow on a cycle comes along I’ll ask him, but I
draw the line at soldiers.’
An enticing placard was shown on hoardings
during the recent festive outbreak. It set forth
the amusements to be derived from a marine ex-
cursion, “the grandest of the season.” The ex-
cursionists had their outing planned for them to
land somewhere down the ’Arbor, spend the day
in “sport, fishing, bathing, fern-gathering,
dancing, &c.” The first-named allurements in the
artistically-worded poster all lead up to the climax.
All the other attractions of the picnic fade before
the entertainment discreetly veiled in the mean-
ingful “&c.” There is generally a great deal of
“ &c.” in every Harbor trip.
Collar-bones are to be covered up with frock in
the near future; the newest ball-frocks are all
creeping up again over the shoulders which were
so long left uncovered. Some croaker has dis-
covered that the relative value of silk or satin as
a surface is greater than that of bone and wrinkle,
to which the stiff, hard, high collars of every-day
wear have reduced the necks of all of us. Some
royal personage had a badly-scarred throat which
she wished to conceal, and so had invented for her
those unyielding buckram gorgets over which
every civilised woman looks and moves stiff-
necked. The lengthy, graceful, swan-like necks
have gone out with the ringlets and fawn-like,
trustful glances of our grandmothers.
The girl who models her fashions on stage
heroines is presenting just now some wildly in-
congruous types of apparel. The enormous Pot-
teresque hat makes every side-walk shady, and
now the plagiarist has to combine that effect with
the hair-dressing of the Chinatown girls, whose
locks appeared to have started in life as a pigtail
which became ambitious of being a knob, and
were checked in mid-career by a ribbon tied in
what sailors call “an Andy Gilligan hitch.” And
she tries to copy Emma Temple’s slim brown
shoes and Ida Hamilton’s elbow-sleeves and glove-
less digits, and if she could only dye her hair the
exact tinge of Harrie Ireland’s “ tresses like the
morn ” she would present an even more con-
glomerate impression than she does now.
Gorgeousness in man just at present is running
to waistcoats. I have seen some really exquisite
vests lately in pale artistic green cloth, with
buttons to match; these are newer than the tan
which, however, still glows on the manly chests of
many of the best-dressed local youths. Summer
ties are formed in bows (I could make a pun here
if I tried), and are a most poetic carelessness in
fluttering ends sometimes. I saw a beauteous
youth loitering in King-street one afternoon. His
clothes were grey, his vest was green, his tie was
cream-and-pink, his boots were tan, his shirt was
limp, the sort that does not shrink; his hat was
soft, with muslin twist, his face was shaven clean,
his stick was hooked, his collar tall, and of such is
the Kingdom of Heaven.
The Artists’ Society has been cheering up the
Eictures in the Temperance Hall, Pitt-street, by
aving weekly afternoon-tea soirees in aid of a
building-fund. Last Saturday’s affair was dis-
tinctly successful—the chairs were all filled with
company listening to music and other adjuncts by
volunteer artists, including a ballad or two by a
fiery-hearted baritone who expressed his longing
to seize his Arab steed by the mane and gallop
over the burning desert, though he looked as if he
never mounted anything more Arabian than a
bicycle.
The dresses in “ True Irish Hearts ” are not so
thrilling as they were said to be in the “special
notice ”on the programme. They are muslin and
many-caped as to the sleeves, and all made after
one pattern with a big flounce round the skirt.
On Monday night a substitute hastily donned the
persecuted S wanton’s gowns and read her part
unconvincingly from the book. Frank M. Clark
wore, for no apparent reason, a tiny shell-jacket
and knickerbockers of brown velvet and looked
like a colossal Little Boy at Manly, and his first-
act boots subsequently walked down the broad
road on the unprincipled, unsteady feet of Scot
Inglis. It is a highly original play as to pronun-
ciation. Chas. M'Carthy, with a voice like the
swish of a shillelagh, talks chestnuts with a brogue,
another character has an unexplained, stage-Ger-
man twang, and the soubrette jokes with difficulty
in Irish until the yacht-scene, where she appa-
rently throws her accent overboard, for it isn’t
very noticeable afterwards. The whole cast stand
by and watch the villain “ aducting ” two children
with whom he plays a game of draughts, removing
first the boy and then the girl, and the good people
lurk in “ruings” and, observing the ruffian’s
mania for burdening himself with puny infants,
remark that they “ sorr ’im steal the kids.” Also,
F. M. Clark kneels on the stage and prays aloud,
which is a most edifying spectacle.
The record price for a drink was paid by a
Westralian prospector, who was found dying of
thirst, in the bush, by a traveller. Too far gone
to speak, the gold-seeker asked by signs for water,
of which the other could give him only half a
pannikin—even then reducing his own chances of
reaching Coolgardie alive :so little had he. The
rescued man’s tongue was black and swollen,
and useless, and he had to write his thanks : “I
have just found a good thing, and, when I sell the
show, I’ll give you half for this.” When the show
was sold, he got .£12,000 for it, and, loyally stick-
ing to his word, gave his rescuer half the profits.
It is a good story, anyhow.
One of the very Nicest matrons in an Austra-
lian capital has a name-double who brings her
into much tribulation by her notorious goings-on.
In one day’s paper the correct and proper Mrs. B.
Dash’s name is recorded as doing good work on
committees and charity-worries, and she sits in the
seats of the mighty, while the next day’s issue
records also that the other Mrs. B. Dash, the local
Lady Munro, has been run in for “ shaking ”
potatoes on the wharf or dangling her black and
rusty bonnet in the faces of the force and “ re-
sisting the police in the execution of their duty.”
The lofty Mrs. D. is too much above suspicion to
necessitate her writing an indignant “Not the
woman” letter signed in full to the news-dis-
seminator, but it gives her pain and sleepless
nights to think that her aristocratic cognomen can
be borne by one of the dregs of creation.
The public ladling-out of grease by the more or
less professional orators who barnacle themselves
on to every notable incident, and the being
labelled “heroes,” was probably the worst of the
ordeals lately undergone by the plucky Orient
boat’s crew whose memorable deed was so enthu-
siastically signalised at Sydney Town Hall on
Tuesday night. lam told that when on the
steamer, the night after the rescue, the passengers
made a presentation to the Orient men, Chief-
officer Ranken, while evidently anxious that his
men’s gameness and endurance should be recog-
nised, hung his head down and squirmed visibly
as his own praises were being sung—he could not
have been less at ease had he been presented at
the police-court on the impossible indictment of
beating a woman. I hear that Mr. Ranken is a
native of Bathurst (N.S.W.) and scion of a well-
known district family—and that he is married to
the daughter of a prominent Sydney accountant.
Yours affectionately,
CLEO.
A Melb. correspondent to The Bulletin :
The writer is once more confirmed in the opinion that
Melbourne’s most sensational dailj' paper keeps a large
stock of blocks pourtraying imaginary faces. Those or
Brady and his alleged slayer (both well known to the
present scribe) must be purely imaginary, as there is not
the remotest resemblance between the portraits and the
originals. Those, by the way, who know the associations
existing between Brady and Phillips are firmly convinced
that there is a woman in the case. The lad accused of
murdering the book-keeper for years used, it appears, to
write letters for Brady to the woman he had “ in tow,” so
that Brady might avoid possible complications by the
production of letters ; and it is known that more than one
of the dead man’s lady friends were “in trouble.” It is
quite feasible that on Brady’s intended marriage to
another girl becoming known to a deceived one, to whom
he might have promised matrimony also, she might have
taken revenge on him with the assistance of an accom-
plice. Anyhow, young Phillips’ easy demeanour under
circumstances that would try the oldest criminal suggests
that he “ knows something,” and the writer is confident
that sensational developments will take place soon after
this sees print.
“ Maroogaline ” to The Bulletin :
A recent Bulletin paragraph would seem to imply that
Parry-Okeden, the present Q. Commissioner of Police,
went North recently with the intention of whitewashing
the aboriginal contingent of his men-whereas he is a man
who would hang a policeman or a private citizen with
equal celerity if he had evidence that either had killed a
blackfellow without good cause. He is a long-tried friend
of the blacks, was reared among them in Gippsland, where
his father was the first squatter to bring in the wild
tribes and establish friendly relations. Young Okeden
learned their language and the use of the spear and
boomerang, mixed in their corrobborees, and joined them
in their He did the same in Queens-
land, and still speaks fairly well the Wacca and Cabbee
dialects of the Darling Downs and Wide Bay. I have
reason to believe that he intends to abolish the native
police force as organised at present, and establish a new
order of things more creditable to the country and in-
finitely more humane to the aboriginals. He will effectu-
ally abolish the old type of native police-officer, the old
style of dispersal, and place a potent curb on the abo-
riginal-killing species of pioneer settlers.
Dear old £ £ Smith, of the amazing fu r
overcoat, got himself interviewed in Tasmania re'
eently, and poured a cataract of advt. into the
local pressman. A sample :
I ran two newspapers, one in Ballarat and one in Mel-
bourne, the latter called the Times and Mines, and I
called a racehorse after it. I also had the Australian
Journal, and it was in this journal I got Marcus Clarke
to write the celebrated novel, “ His Natural Life.” I have
written about a dozen works on medical subjects. I also
caused to be made, at great expense, an anatomical
museum, at which I lectured, afternoons and evenings, to
crowded houses. I must have had an iron frame, for at
this time I was chairman of many companies, was lectur-
ing twice a day on fresh subjects, supervising two papers,
president of two Royal Commissions ; I had two farms of
my own, one an experimental farm, for the people, on
which I grew cabbages which cost me 9d. each, and I
could buy them in the market at two for Id. ; I was
member of Parliament, and writing my “Almanac” and
also articles on different medical subjects for tlqe Press,

tralias, amounting at one time to £13,000 per year. . . .

citizens, at which the Premier, the Speaker, the leader of
the Opposition, with a large gathering from both Houses,
and the chairmen of different institutions, where i was

came to Tasmania, and I am fined £lO and costs by a Mr.

trip for my holiday 1
A man who saw the Orient-Phyllis affair
writes to The Bulletin :
The relief of the starving seamen of the brig Phyllis by
a boat’s crew from the liner Orient, which formed the
subject of the big public demonstration presided over by
Gov. Hampden in Sydney on Tuesday night, was a truly
soil-ring deed. The big steamer on its way from Mel-
bourne to Sydney encountered a hurricane. It raged
for many hours and raised a mountainous sea, which con-
tinued when the wind abated. In pursuance of mail-
steamer tactics, Oapt. Inskip put out far from land, and
there, remote from the ordinary steamer-track, found the
brig, her sails blown to ribbons, helplessly wallowing in
the trough of the huge waves. Signals showed that her
crew' were starving, and as she had lost her boat,
remained but for the Orient, herself tossed about like
a cork by gigantic short seas which broke every
time, to send a boat with food. It was an appalling task
truly a forlorn hope, but Mr. P. J. Ranken, R.N.R., the
chief-officer, offered to face it, and at once picked a crew
of six from the numerous seamen who volunteered. The
gallant six were not a big set of men, three of them were
distinctly undersized, but they were a well-knit, tough
lot, fit to pull for their lives, which was exactly what
they had to do for the next three hours and a half. Hav-
ing put on life-belts, they got into a clean-lined, smart-
looking boat of semi - whaler tvpe hung near the
steamer’s stern, and took their daring plunge—in which
their craft was so'badly stove that thereafter she had to
be continuously baled. But they got away, and soon it
was perceived that the boat had not only a grand set of
oarsmen but that it possessed in the chief-officer a
rough-water helmsman such as is rarely met except in a
whaling crew 7 . So tremendous were the seas that for
quite half the time you could not catch, even from the
high vantage of the Orient’s hurricane-deck, a single
glimpse of the boat as it chased the distressed bri«- which
rapidly went to leeward, and thus greatly added’ to the
big task the Orient men had set themselves. When the
boat was lowered the brig was within about 500yds. of the
mail-steamer, now hove-to, but owing to the confused
breaking sea and varying wind it is probable that the
crew had to pull six or seven times that distance to reach
the stern of the brig, over which supplies were with diffi-
culty passed by line. With the return began the real
troubles of the Orient men. The sky to windward as-
sumed an evil scowl, along came a hurricane-squall and a
still more difficult sea, and for a time neither brig* nor
boat was visible from the Orient. Gloom settled on the
steamer s crew and passengers, for night was near and for
boat to be separated from steamer in such water meant
certain death for the returning seven—and, at best how
were the men to board the ship ? But the boat at last did
re appear, on the port side, from which it had been
dropped and which had now become the weather side
and when at length it got within 100yds. of the
big vessel the now-exhausted men looked up—as if
to measure their chance-and the people on deck looked
down, far down into the wave-hollow, and thought of
them in the same helpless way one thinks of the drown-
mg dog which he sees vainly treading water along the sea-
wall, devoid of any landing-place. “Buckley’s show”
was plainly the portion of that gallant band of sportsmen
Can tdo it, sir shouted the chief-officer, above the roar
of the storm, to the anxious captain on the bridsre—“ too
dangerous-must try the other side.” The captain told
the mate and his men to save themselves, for the boat
could not be saved. And then another rain-squall came
and in the growing darkness half-an-hour, during which
the boat was sometimes visible and sometimes utterlv in
visible from the ship, was spent in getting to lee Anri
what a lee it was ! When those on deck looked down and
saw in the great gulfs the little boat, on which the electric
light had now been turned, some of them went below that
!u ey , n °t see tlle end. One man, more “done”
than the rest, was pulled up on a bow-line, but the others
simply hung- on to ropes, and-marvellous feat of en
durance under the circumstances-were hauled the whole
way from boat to bulwarks. Three men came up on one
line—the chief-officer was the last man out of the boat
and not one of the lot could stand when he reached
deck. The boat drifted away in the darkness, and has
since been found beached, near Ulladulla. The men, when
they reached the weather-side of the steamer, certainly
never expected to see land again, and the chief-officer
one of them told the present writer next morning said
time for prayers had come.” Altogether, it was a si-ht
to make a man s blood tingle, but it was one which no
body would care to see twice.

haunts he cares to affect, and the Go t., J
of Adams’s sweep to Hobart (Tas ) has losti ±BO,OOO a J ear
in the PO returns. (That is easy to conceive. Gverj
correspondent had to send, in addition to deposit, nioney
for a stamped reply. Tasmania rakes' th ® fPf
and heaps of Queensland money goes to Hobait.) Also,
the chief totalisator is that at Albion Park= ™°®° ou £®®j
Races are held there every wee k , and Brisbane and
suburbs drop £30,000 a year into the Albion tote a one.
Other totes only appear at far-apart se , a * on .
The Govt, only gets £750 a year from the Albion tote.
The tote also makes more than appears on the surface.
It scoops in all fractions of a shilling. For instance, if
the “div.” is 17s. lid, to be paid to 63 persons, the tote
pavs 17s. and scoops in 63 elevenpences, or £2 17s. 9a. 1
This sort of thing repeated on every race tells up.
How ever did Byrnes come to do it ? He is
ordinarily a knowing man, and quite capable, when in his
normal condition of intellect, of foreseeing the incidence
of so one-sided and foolish a law. Who pulled his leg ;t
A “Nonconformist conscience”? Not possible, even if
Leperland had any sort of a conscience at all. Byrnes is,
or was, “ the rising hope of the Catholic party, and the
R.C.’s are essentially a sporting lot.

Auckland R.C. has at last resolved to bracket,
for betting purposes, all horses similarly owned in the
same race. The defeat of the G.N. Stakes favorite,
Multiform, by his stable companion, Medallist, is respon-
sible ; yet the main result in such cases may be that both
horses will start at a short price, instead of one a hot
favorite and any odds the other.

Ex-Premier Henry Dobson (Tas.) has to be very
careful in picking his words re Tat.tersall Adams. He is
opposed to the sweeps, being in the Opposition, and at
the same time he is a candidate for Brighton electorate ;
and to the Brighton Racing Club, which Henry D. patro-
nises, Adams has given £5O. Ergo, H.D. had, on New
Year’s Day, to “ cordially express his gratitude” to Mr.
Adams for his “ munificent gift,” and at the same time to
say no word in favor of his being settled in ’Obart.
• * * *
“ Could George Adams,” writes a Bulletin
correspondent, “ explain how it is that horse-owners get
to know the names and addresses of ticket-holders in
sweeps? A friend of the writer’s received a wire from a
horse-owner in a recent race two days before the list of
Tatt.’s drawing came to hand, when he knew his number
represented •. Of course he ‘ arranged ’ matters
with the owner ; but to make up he plunged all his spare
cash on the horse at 25 to 1, and, as the animal got home,
he managed to get a bit even with the man who
threatened to ‘ scratch ’ if his terms were not agreed to.”

Artist Carrington and his wife, both of the
Australasian, are reported to have given Ikey Mo quite
a hard knock, at the races lately. The press so seldom
gets a reasonable revenge upon its hook-nosed acquaint-
ance that The Bulletin records this startling rumor with
much pleasure, and hopes that the happy pair hacked the
double, or whatever it was, for nothing’ less than half a
million.

Walter Higinbotham does not consider it quite
good enough to leave his local interests to take charge of
Newhaven in England, so the odds are the Australian
crack will be handled by a Britisher on English soil.

Tom Lees and the one-time sensational horse
Torpedo, disqualified in Australia, are still companions in
South Africa, where Lees still knocks a race and a few
pounds out of the old ’un. How time flies ! Ten years
last. September since Peter Jackson and Tom Lees met at
Foley’s old White Horse for £4OO and the championship,
and Jackson chased Lees round the ring for two solid
hours before cornering him.

A Melb. paper, commenting on the attempt to
revive trotting handicaps at Canterbury Park, says : “ No
doubt this step, if adopted by other clubs and regularly
pursued by Canterbury, will attract some of the trotting
identities from this colony, which will be a misfortune foi
Sydney.” All over the world the same cry. Trotting
races breed more dangerous blackguardism than the other
kind of horse sport. The ill-fated boy who fancies pigeons
is father to the flash person who loves a fast trotter.

For the trot at Brighton, Sydney, on Monday,
Harry Knight, driving Edith, led into the straight, but
Gus Milson had a bit left in Creole, and taking his only
chance brought him up on the inside. Knight was quite
in his province had he closed in on the rails, but he drew
out and gave a clear field. The pair then trotted nose-
and-nose to the finish, no one being able to divide them,
until the judge declared for Creole by a nose. This is the
sort of finish trotting wants more of to take on with the
crowd.

One well-known Flemington double eventei
growled at a big bettor for never taking a double with
him. “I suppose,” said the latter, “you wouldn’t lav
a fair amount if I did want one?” “Oh, yes I would "
said Ikey Mo. “Then £lOOO to £3O Pigs-cheek and

The same book had similar luck in Glenloth's

hearing Mossy yelling 100 to 1 Glenloth, put on a
sovereign, but, after getting her ticket, discovered and

Premier Nelson is the least-known public
man in Brisbane. It is quite an event to see him
in Queen-street. When not at the Treasury count-
ing che public debt he is at Toowoomba or South-
port.
The Mayor of an Australian capital is so
involved that it is not improbable he will be in the
Insolvency Court before the completion of his
term of office. Moneyed men are making a set
against him for political reasons.
Melbourne boasts of at least a score of
lady-detectives, several of whom move in the best
society. One, well-known to the writer, earned
over <£4oo last year, and still manages to hide her
profession from her most intimate friends.
It is related that the manager of a Wes-
tralian mine lately wrote to the London directors
that he would have to put down a shaft which
would cost <£2500. Whereupon a director said :
*' Can’t we get a second-hand one and send it out?”

It is printed that Queen Victoria is now a
teetotaller ; three years ago she entirely aban-
doned alcohol, and is quite satisfied with the ex-
periment. It can be said for Queen Victoria,
anyhow, that on this subject she is not bigoted,
having given both sides a fair trial.
The name Phillips will presently be in as
bad odor as that of Butler. One Phillips is
charged at Melbourne with the murder of book-
keeper Brady, and two of the same name, aged 16
and 14 years respectively, are committed for trial
at Mudgee for murdering their father.

Macdonald-Paterson, M.L.A., who wiped
out Attorney-General Byrnes for North Brisbane
at last Q. general election, drank a Xmas cup
with his defeated foe, who was persuaded by a
peace-making parson to smile and shake hands and
tell Mac.-Pat. that he loved him like a brother.
Britishah : “ Surely George Turner,
K.C.M.G., will take official cognisance of the fact
that two common Melb. shoemakers, by assuming
the title of knighthood in their puffs, are dragging
Her Majesty in the mire, while a third has the
impudence to placard himself as a lord, with the
addenda of 5.N.0.8.”
Re that “Life of Parkes,” author Charley
Lyne can’t well be blamed for dealing with his old
patron in a friendly, not to say generous, spirit.
The deceased ex-Premier was an excellent friend
to Mr. Lyne, whom he took from the drudgery of
press-work and made Secretary of N.S.W. Public
Works Committee at ,£7OO a year.
It is recorded of one Australian knight
that he more or less earned his bauble by giving
the Governor of the day some valuable advice
respecting a “ really good thing ” into which the
crowd who had induced Lord Carnarvon and
others to speculate in city property sought to put
His Excellency.
Robert Porteous, who had been confined in
the debtors’ side of Darlinghurst Gaol since March,
1892, for non-payment of £99, due as alimony
to his wife, was lately released through the action
of the N.S.W. Minister for Justice. Porteous
could have obtained his release after 12 months’
confinement by filing his schedule in bankruptcy.
This he refused to do. Under an Act passed in
1896 the Minister can assume the responsibility of
filing the schedule whether the debtor likes it or
not. This Act cuts two ways—it releases the
debtor, and, possibly, obtains from his estate (if
he has one) the required alimony.
The Bulletin’s London cor-
respondent writes : “A man of high
professional standing told me this
strange tale, the truth of which he
vouches for. There were two students
attending Glasgow University. One
was English and the other American.
They were inseparable chums, and
painted the ancient city of St. Mungo
bright red on many occasions. Then
they were jointly seized with a gloomy
and awful variety of religion, and swore
off wassail and festivity. Later, the
American set out with his mother and
sister for a season in Paris. They were
very wealthy, and the women-folk ex-
cessively fond of frivolity, but the son’s
drab-coiored creed was to them a wet
blanket that twines round the neck and
drips down the spine. He sat heavily
on their joys and talked to them in a
nasal monotone about their souls—until
he fell bodily ill. He grew worse, and
suddenly better ;much worse, and again
much better. The doctors were puzzled
completely. He died midst the love
and lamentations of his broken-hearted
relatives—and there is now little doubt
that it was a ease of systematic poison-
ing. To-day the sister resides in
Wormwood Scrubs Prison, and is
known to the world as that ‘ much-
wronged woman ’ Mrs. Maybrick,
doing a life sentence for the alleged
murder of her husband. My informant
says he was the other student. He
has lost his drab-colored creed and
takes a moderate amount of wassail in
bis respectable middle age, and he isn’t
one of the Maybrick band of sympa-
thisers —not by any means.”
Father Fouhy, of Brisbane (Q.), when in-
terviewed by a Denver (U.S.A.) newspaper-man,
during his recent “grand tower,” was asked :
“ What is your name ? ” “Oh, put me down as
the Queen of Sheba.” “What have you to say
about anything?” “Nothing. Good-night.”
And the Denver man absquatulated and fabri-
cated a column and a-half of a most interesting
interview.
Henry Wenden, another of the men who
narrowly escaped going on a death-trip with
Butler, says that Butler “ appeared to be a most
pleasant fellow, and had a very taking manner.”
Very taking. Very undertaking also. But really
this al fresco murderer must have possessed much
personal magnetism. If he had devoted his atten-
tion to politics instead of murder he might have
done better—perhaps.
Ash, Premier Kingston’s law-partner,
lately sought to deduct the price of his wig (£8),
tram-fares between his office and home, and the
cost of a law newspaper from the taxable amount
of his income, but the magistrate would not allow
more than the newspaper. There is to be an
appeal to the Supreme Court, and Ash, a very
stubborn personage, threatens to go thence to the
Privy Council if he does not get what he regards
as justice.
The case of Mrs. Cecile Anderson, found
guilty, in Melbourne, some years ago, of shooting
one Fraser, under very extenuating circumstances,
is brought up now and then. But, somehow, her
episode never seems to get a hold on the public
mind, though the public raves a good deal over
many less deserving. She is gaoled and forgotten.
There was a very considerable-sized doubt in Mrs.
Anderson’s case all along, and a very little differ-
ence in the jury’s liver should have saved her.
She and Fraser were in a room together, and,
when the noise of some considerable shooting
attracted attention, one was found dead and the
other injured. The lady said that he shot her
unsuccessfully, and then shot himself successfully.
The jury decided, for no very observable reason, that
she shot him successfully, and then went gunning
for her own brains, and made a failure of it.
Probably the hair that turned the scale was the
fact that Fraser had treated Mrs. Anderson so
badly that any woman in her place would natu-
rally feel like shooting him ; and this fact might
as well have been read the other way about—
Fraser’s conduct towards Mrs. Anderson showed
him to be bad enough to shoot her or anybody
else. The case was more-or-less of a toss-up, and
it isn’t at all certain, even yet, whether the coin
came down endways or not.

Geo. Thorn and Wm. Thorn are brothers
and Q’land M.L.A.’s. George is fat and jolly,
Bill is lean and sorrowful. George warns the
Government of impending dooin, and always sits
and votes with them. William is one of the
“ remnant,” or Opposition. He occupies his time
in the House either in denouncing the bicycle on
the ground that it is ruining the farmers, or in
advocating the Goombungee railway. No one
else knows where Goombungee is. In division
the brothers invariably face each other.
Ecclesiastical affairs are somewhat mixed
in Brisbane. Rev. G. D. Buchanan is leaving the
pulpit to be a Government immigration lecturer.
Smith, the man who takes a deep interest in the
local aboriginal, has retired from the vineyard
through old age, and the Scots Church meenister,
Rev. J. F. M‘Swaine, is in London where he has
had 19 operations performed on his throat, without
success. Also, a local reverend is leaving owing

but the matter has been keot very secret.

Lately-deceased Gov. Weld placed the
Westralian press “on a proper social basis.” In
the early days many members of the “ Fourth
Estate ” were “old-timers,” and so were not
actually admitted to public feeds, but were allowed
to come in afterwards and report the speeches.
One “ untainted ” scribe demurred to this arrange-
ment, and refused to take any note of the
speeches at a public function. His refusal and the
reason of it coming to the ears of the then
Governor, orders were given that at any social
function at which H.E. was present the reporters
were to be admitted on the footing' of ordinary
guests. A memorable trouble of like character
occurred at Sydney during the Loftus regime.
When the eminent Arthur Orton was
butchering at Wagga, he was much annoyed by
the local cockatoo farmers stealing meat out of the
slaughter-yards. So one day, when a two-year-
old colt died, he just skinned and dressed the
carcase and left it on the gallows. Next morning
the carcase was gone, and several of the residents
were so queer, they thought they’d die. Arthur
thought “ they must be took bad from eating too
much veal with shoes on.”
Charles Eckenstein, the gilt-edged cycling
“ professor, ” who was allowed to keep his name
dark when giving evidence against a Melbourne
pub. the other week, has now published his
identity by committing suicide. A lady in the
case, perhaps. A man who teaches sassiety to
perform on the giddy bike is pretty sure to fall
madly in love with the first fair pupil who doesn’t
smile upon him. The phenomenal circumstance
is too much for his feelings.
A soft-hatted individual entered Parlia-
ment House, Brisbane, one morning lately, and
said to a messenger: “I’ve an appointment at
this hour with Mr. Nelson.” “Who?” “Mr.
Nelson.” “Who-o-o?” “ Nelson, the Premier.”
“Do you mean Sir ’Ugh ? ” “That’s the bloke."
The messenger staggered. But the interviewer
had merely forgotten the title, and was unused
to using'it. . . . “I found out afterwards,”
said the aghast flunkey, “that he was only a
common newspaper man from down South.”
The talismanic Hugh Williams cannot be
altogether appropriated by the British Admiralty
as its very own. Australia also has its record. At
the big Redfern-railway smash two years ago,
when an incoming suburban and an out going
country train collided, one engineer-driver was
killed and the other escaped absolutely unhurt.
His name was Hugh Williams, and he is at present
employed on the South African railways. Visitors
to the Hawkesbury must be familiar with the
initials, “ H.W.,” printed with charcoal high up
on one of the cliffs on the southern side of the
river midway between the bridge and Kangatoo
Point. They were put there by an adventuresome
Hugh Williams, who, when he had climbed up,
found it was impossible to get back, and from that
height made a big leap out into the river. He was
rescued in an almost drowning state by Captain
Melvey, of the Binghie. When coming off the
Binghie at Brooklyn, he fell into the water, and
was fished out by a small boat alongside. In the
train he had a row with a fellow passenger, and
was thrown out. The guard saw the accident;
train was stopped, and H. W. was picked up none
the worse for his mishap. He had fallen on part
of an old orchard. A Hugh Williams, residing
in Maori]and, was once the winner of Tattersall’s
big sweep. The sole survivor of a memorable
yacht accident on the Yarra in Jubilee year was
Hugh Williams. And early in ’92 the Westralian
papers gave particulars of the finding of two pros-
pectors on the road to Menzies in a terribly
famished and dying condition. One afterwards
succumbed, the other—who pulled through, and is
now in a good way of .business in Perth —was Hugh
Williams.

£ £ Smith’s daddy, showman E. T. Smith
of Drury Lane, founded his fortunes by borrowing
from money-lender Geneste a <£looo-note at £1
per day interest. Armed with this he would
attend auctions, and when the time came for
payment would calmly tender the JROOO-note, for
which the clerk never had change. Awe-inspired
auctioneers would send round the purchases to
Smith’s rooms, and he would re-sell them at a
higher figure and pay up a day or two later. In
a couple of months the note was returned to
Geneste unchanged.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Sydney papers have the carriage of
their opinions—gratis.
H. : “The Colonial Office ignores, or
rather is ignorant of, the real power in Victorian
statesmanship. Why not Sir David Syme ? ”
N.S.W. Opposition has voted that Federa-
tion should be treated in a national spirit. The
national spirit is all right, provided the party
hasn’t mislaid the corkscrew.
Owing to the opposition of the Govt, and
the Labor-party in the S.A. Assembly, the land-
grant transcontinental railway to Port Darwin
has been defeated for the present year. A still
more determined effort in its favor is to be made
next session.
One Hobart view of the Hare system : “If
I can’t plump for Mr. B. now, I won’t vote at all.
He’s in my church and I want to plump for him.
If he don’t get in, I’ve got the satisfaction of
knowing I did plump for him, anyhow.” How
very Tasmanian !
Four Q. Labor-members have been made
Jaypees. Last year the Q. Labor-members fussed
largely against any such prospect, but this year
they have quietly swallowed the indignity. No
valid reason why they shouldn’t. It’s a mere
matter of taste. Nevertheless, it shows that the
Nelson crowd knows how to lime the twigs.
There is calm impudence about the decision
of the S.A. Opposition that the Federal Conven-
tion elections should not be run on party lines.
Of the 125,000 male and female voters in the pro-
vince, not m,ore than the odd 25,000 would vote
for the Opposition candidates if a partisan spirit,
as Kingston desires in the Democratic interest,
pervades the contests.
The fiscal issue absolutely can’t help crawl-
ing in at the Federal Convention. Federation
obviously means Freetrade in Australia and Pro-
tection against the world, and it will take the
smartest and least scrupulous Freetrader all his
time to dodge the question already in the mouths
of election barrackers —which probably accounts
for the supineness of Premier Reid when he seems
to have Australia by the ears.
T|h e co m -
plete figures of
the Maoriland
prohibition poll
are not pleasant
reading for the
Cold Tea in-
terest. Since
the last poll in
’94 the enfran-
chisement of
women has
about doubled
the number of
voters. In ’94,
48,606 votes
were given for
prohibition ; in
’96 the prohibi-
tion vote was
95,825, or not
quite double.
In ’94, the votes
for maintaining
the number of
licenses as at
present were
41,695 ; in ’96,
they numbered
136,675, or over
three times as
many. There-
fore, it would
either seem that
the male com-
munity has re-
lapsed greatly
into whisky
during the last
two years, or
that the female
vote has been
in the main
against the Cold
Tea interest.
The M.L.
female voterhas
been a disap-
pointment to
everybody who trusted in her.
Sydney D.T. and N.S.W. Premier Reid
are now of one mind on the character of Upper
House reform—nomineeism, with rotatory retire-
ments. In Parkes’s day of power that paper was
also of one mind with him on the same subject—
“ the true democratic principle of an elective
Chamber.”
Rockhampton (C.Q.) Record’s retort on
the Brisbane press attitude :
In Southern Queensland th,e objection has been raised
that the manufacturing industries of Queensland would
be injured by Federation. The metropolitan brewers, it
is declared, would all be ruined, as Sydney and Mel-
bourne, with their financial resources and big popula-
tions, would be able to flood Queensland with their surplus
at a price that would knock the local beer out of the
market. At the same time, it is admitted that Brisbane
brewers are doing with respect to Rockhampton and
Townsville exactly what they dread would be done by
Sydney under Federation.
An interesting squabble, if only from the view-
point that Beer as well as Black Man is a “ lion
in the path ” of Q.’s joining the Federation.
An inspired paragraph says that Col. Sec.
Brunker will be one of the Federal Convention
nominees of N.S.W. Ministry. What has Mr.
Brunker done that he should be delegated to help
in framing a constitution for Australia ? Mr.
Brunker is a good-natured, respectable, privately-
honest old gentleman who has auctioned more
bullocks than most men ; he is fat and placid and
writes that copy-book-like hand which was never
the attribute of anyone nearer to genius than an
average tailor’s foreman. But how he ever be-
came N.S.W. Colonial Secretary, or why he
should be set up as a Federal Convention delegate
is a mystery as deep as why Gag Gould should be
continually chosen as N.S.W. Minister of Justice.
Nothing that has previously happened has
done so much to make S.A. look small and mean
and hopelessly parochial as the Adelaide Hospital
dispute. If the fact ever really soaks into the
comprehension of people outside that S. A. politics
have been convulsed for two years over the
appointment of one hospital nurse, and Royal
Commissions have wrestled with the matter, and
it was believed by many that the Kingston
Government would ultimately fall by reason of
it,' then it will be a very long time before S.A.
will again be regarded as a serious institution.
When 903,000 square miles of territory are
roused to excitement for 24 months over the
appointment of one lady at a small salary to be
supervisor of broken legs in an hospital it is diffi-
cult to take that place seriously.
Since Queensland shuffled out of the
Federation movement its politicians have manifes-
ted an unexpected interest in the old, useless
Federal Council —the tired thing that meets at
Hobart once in two years and does nothing. At-
torney-General Byrnes, in particular, wants all
the provinces to pass an Act making the members
of the Federal Council elective, and giving them
enlarged powers ; and he professed to be hurt and
surprised that nobody takes any notice of the
little red herring he is drawing across the track.
Yet Attorney-General Byrnes himself doesn’t
waste his time now patching the knickerbockers
he wore when he was a boy, for the sufficient
reason that he doesn’t want them any more. And
his proposal that Australia, just when it is getting
measured for its new pants, should waste time re-
pairing the pants it wore out the year before last
is sheer stupidity.
A DIFFERENT THING.
NEW-CHUM (“all broke-up”) : “ You said this horse was that quiet a child could
PLAY with him. Just look at me!”
THE DEALER: “That’s true. But you were riding him!”
According to a recent cable, all the British
thread-making companies have amalgamated into
one huge concern with 74 millions capital, and an
attempt is being made to include the American
thread-factories in the combination. If they can
be included the ring will boss the world’s trade,
and fix prices very much as it pleases. The
Foreign-trade theory that rings and trusts only
grow under Protection seems to have gone wrong
just here.
A wail fromLißEßTY —organ of the National
Ass :
Under the Victorian Usury Limitation Bill, no person
may borrow money, and pa}- a greater interest than 8 per
cent. If his security is such that he could only get money
he wanted at, say, 9 or 10 percent., he cannot borrow, and
would, perhaps, have to go to the wall. Heaven save us
from this grandmotherly legislation !
Likewise, in other times and places, a man who
had no other security could borrow on his family
—it being sold into slavery to recover the debt, if
he didn’t pay up. But grandmotherly legislation
has prohibited that in most countries now, and the
man who has no other security to borrow on than
his family has to go to the wall. Yet the wall
seems none the worse, and there are no trade con-
vulsions through a person being prohibited from
raising money on his offspring, and nothing special
has happened.
British Cabinet-Minister Balfour : “If
Ireland were to abandon the manufacture of
whisky, the present grievance ” —respecting alleged
unjust taxation of Ireland by Bull —“would dis-
appear.” Gurroo ! If Ireland abandoned the
manufacture of whisky, Irishmen would disappear.
If the world curled away in a bonfire, Balfour
would disappear. The larger contains the less of
its own kind. Ireland is whisky and whisky is
Ireland —more or less.
SUSPICIOUS.
BUSH PUBLICAN (answering question): “ Why,
he’s the son of a rale English jook. ”
SHREWD FARMER: “ Been paying his way?”
B. P.: “ I very sixpence.”
S. F.: “ Then I’d say he’s an out an’ out impostor! ”
Vic. : “A nonsensical rumor is started of
a coalition between Turner and Gillies. _ It only
means that the Tories want such a coalition badly.
Turner doesn’t need to coalesce with anybody.
Moreover, if he did, Gillies isn’t anybody. Dun-
can is about as weighty as the big ballooney ele- >
phant Lauri toys with in ‘Matsa.’ ”
From a recent speech at the National Ass
Federation meeting by G. Republican Dibbs: —
“ By the creation of the Federal Parliament as
proposed by the Commonwealth scheme, they would
be creating another set of hungry political loafers
to be provided for by the working bees of this
country. ” Experto crede 1
Maoriland Government intends making a
vigorous effort to carry its Old Age Pension Bill
this year. As a preliminary it contrived last ses-
sion to crowd through a little Act for the registra-
tion and sorting out of all claims on the proposed
pension fund, and the work is now beginning in
earnest. This is at least a proof that business is
intended.
Vic. Freetrader Boyd and the Vic. Free'
trade clan in general ask, scornfully, how Tren-
with can advocate a protective duty on coal
imported into Victoria, and also support Federa-
tion and the consequent abolition of interprovin-
cial Protection ? Another question, equally to the
point, is how Vic. Freetraders concur to this day
in supporting a purely local military force which
is kept ready for use against all comers, the people
of adjacent provinces included, while they pro-
fess to preach unity? What is the exact dif-
ference between maintaining a provincial tariff in
the present while advocating an arrangement
which will make it unnecessary in the future, and
maintaining a provincial military force now while
barracking for a system which will involve its
abolition ? Will the Argus explain ?
If Card. Moran, the big Catholic, is per-
mitted to become a candidate for the Federal
Convention, some little Catholics will naturally
try to crowd in under his wing. First result:
formation of a Catholic “ bunch ” of candi-
dates—certain of election by the block Catholic
vote rounded up by the parish priests from the
pulpit and privately. Second result: formation
of a rival Protestant “bunch,” which, though it
may not be so successful, will be successful
enougti—with the aid of the Freemasons and the
Boyne-water bhoys—to get good representation on
the Convention. Third result: Orange cursing
Green across the floor of the Convention, and
Green yelling for the blood of Orange, and the
business of founding an Australian nation damned
utterly in the strife of the worst sectarian passions.
From all which, Good Lord, and the good sense
of the community, deliver us.
Q. Attorney - General Byrnes (re the
Federal Council): “I have not the slightest dis-
position to be a member of a body that exists on
sufferance, as it were.” (Because Federal Coun-
cillors are not elected by the people, he further
explained. Which was surely very calm on the
part of one of the high priests of bulcockery—
representative of a gang which, but for its roll-
faking and plural-vote insistence, would be in a
hopeless electoral minority.) And wouldn’t
“Tommy” Byrnes have proudly attended the
Federation Convention as a delegate not elected
by the people? Smile right here. For is he not
the quondam “Irish Home Rule” man who
patronised Michael Davitt, and yet who, to retain
his office as Attorney-General, countenanced and
clinched the iniquitous Coercion Act in Queens-
land (Home Secretary Tozer said he was the real
author of it) ? And if “ Tommy ” had popped up
or were to pop up by any future fluke, as a Feder-
ation Convention delegate, would he not be such
“only on sufferance, as it were?” And isn’t
“Tommy” at present an M.P. “only on suffer-
ance, as it were,” by the hustings retirement of
Arthur Morgan at Warwick, and by the grace
(and grease for the R.C. vote) of Premier Nelson
“ as it were ”? ’

There are se-
veral little points
in connection
with the N.S.W,
Landlord and
Tenants’ Act
about which the
public have
wrong ideas. It
is commonly sup-
posed that when
a tenant wishes
to leave, a week’s
notice must be
given or rent for
that period for-
feited. There is
nothing in the
Act to that effect,
True, it is often
so stipulated in
the receipt form,
but that docu-
ment has no Par-
liamentary enact-
ment behind it.
Also a tenant’s
day does not ter-
minate until mid-
night. Many per-
sons imagine
their term is up
by noon on Mon-
day, when as a
matter of fact
their tenancy
holds good till 12
p.m. Agents gen-
erally keep war-
rants signed in
blank by owners
for the purpose
of distraining. If
the occupant
could prove this
—say, by show-
ing that the owner was not in town when the
warrant was alleged to have been signed—the
distraint can be upset; no document signed in
blank is legal.
Considerably more than a fourth of the
total population of S.A. are now depositors in
the Savings Bank, the number of depositors
having risen to 92,005 at the end of last year. The
Land of Thrift.
Government by Contradiction places men
over departments of which they know nothing.
Sheridan, unable to work a sum in long division,
became Chancellor of the British Exchequer;
news-vendor Smith, who never went to sea, became
boss of the British navy ; and the untutored Jacob
Garrard controls N.S.W. University and schools !
When Randolph Churchill became Chancellor of
the Exchequer he could not understand a return
until the clerk explained that it was carried out to
decimals. “Oh ! ” exclaimed Churchill, “ I never
knew before what those damned dots meant.”

Sept. 28, 1895, says:
“ If I were asked which single medicine I should
prefer to take abroad with me, as likely to be
most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I should say Chlorodyne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.” .

Mr. Greenfield, of the well-known firm of
Greenfield and Barraclough, whose eyesight-test-
ing invention is the latest boon to sufferers from
defective vision, is now doing his regular tour of
all the large N.S.W. towns.*
T. H. Molesworth, formerly of the
Adelaide School of Mines has removed his Assay
Office and Chemical Laboratory from 56 Margaret-
street to 5 Moore-street, Sydney, and is open to
do business with all Australasia.*
Wm. Mackenzie, over 30 years manager of
the celebrated Bebeah (N.S.W.) vineyard, has
opened a Sydney depdt for sale of its wines at 379
George-street, Sydney. The Bebeah vineyard has
won 466 first and champion prizes, and its pro-
ducts can be warmly recommended to everybody
who has sense enough to know- that a good, pure
wine at a reasonable price is the most natural and
palatable drink for Australians.*
The Red Bird bicycle, with Bilmartin and
flyer Kellow on top, is riding its way into a good
big business. The Red Bird, with its distinctive
name, has loosened up the Australian bike-trade
tremendously, and A. J. Knowles (“ Hullo Bill ”)
will see that no one gets the jump on him. Bil-
martin’s Red Bird weighs an ounce or two over
18ib., and many people thought that the strong,
heavy plugger would plug the light machine into
dismemberment and dissolution. But William
and his bike are both going strong and well—a
good cyclist and a good cycle.*
The Eye-sight measure sent per post by
the inveptors, Messrs. Greenfield and Barraclough,
the well-known opticians of George-st., Sydney,
is a wonderful little contrivance which will enable
eye-sufferers in the country to ascertain the data
necessary for obtaining proper spectacles. The
subtler forms of sight-defect cannot, of course, be
measured by the instrument, but it is thoroughly
effective for the more usual forms of eye affection
such as long sight, short sight, old sight. Full
particulars from Messrs. Greenfield and Barra-
clough. *

a corner of his head, were made knights. Then
the mistake was discovered and the entire page
re-set to cover a milder par.

Of late years the Tasmanian summer meetings
nave proved happy hunting-grounds for Ikey Mo and co.,
who have popped over from Vic. to rake in the islanders’
shekels; but all that has been put an end to by the
introduction of the totalisator, no fewer than seven
machines being prepared for the ensuing Cup meeting.
If the “blind” tote proves a success, its early introduc-
tion into Vic. and N.S.W. may be depended upon, a con-
summation devoutly to be wished.

The progeny of that sterling stayer, Trident
Robinson Crusoe—Cocoanut), are repeatedly being re-
turned winners. On Saturday last two of his daughters
won at Canterbury Park, N.S.W.; and yet but few owners
of really first-class mares avail themselves of his services.
• * » *
At Canterbury Park, N.S.W., on Saturday last,
Moran weighed out for The King in Flying Welter, but
that horse was subsequently scratched a few minutes
after the authorised time, and yet, under Tattersall’s Club
rule, backers have to pay, the horse being considered a
starter. At Rosehill, only recently, backers had similarly
to pay over Woodford, although that horse was never at
the starting-post, his jockey having taken suddenly ill.
The rule, for the protection of backers, needs immediate
revision, and no horse should lie deemed a starter until it
has come under the starter’s orders. This rule at present
obtains both in Vic. and Great Britain.

The anniversary meeting of that somewhat
mysterious body, the Sydney Turf Club, begins to-day
(Saturday) at Randivick. In the Challenge Stakes, the
handicapper has apparently treated Moorefield and Wha-
kawatea as “ has beens,” with the probable result that
one of the pair will be returned winner, Akarini and
Aurea perhaps being their most dangerous opponents.
The Anniversary Handicap, to be run on Tuesday, should
bring out a good field, and the M.L. Sabretache appears
to have a real good chance of winning, and thus proving
that his Derby trial was correct. Glendennon and Kalla-
tina may also run well.

The handicap for the L.V.W. Cup last Saturday
was an amusing satire on last year’s expedition of Aus-
tralian bike champions to Hingland. Ten scratch men
were placed 20 yards in front of Megson, R. W. Lewis, and
Payne, who were estimated at 10 yards better than ex-
hero Parsons.
* * * *
A summons case in Melb. District Court last
week was calculated to disillusionise the girls who dote
on the dark-eved Italiarii bikists. An ex-cook, bearing the
brigandish name of Bellotti, sued Joseph Gardano, other-
wise known as Boidi, for wages due under an alleged
agreement. Boidi persuaded, or rather encouraged, his
ambitious compatriot, the cook, to abandon the kitchen
for a cycling career, and, for awhile, the aspiring novice
made himself useful in Boidi’s little bike shop. He re-
ceived his food, and half-a-crown per week for Sunday
revellings, also an old bicycle costume, and a vague
promise that he should be educated in the art of winning
a beginners’ race. It transpired in evidence that Porta
asked Bellotti in the shop why he stayed there for a
weekly two and sixpence instead of going back to the
cooking. Probably the romantic foreigner has returned
to the manufacture of gravy by this time. He lost his case
on the ground that he had no agreement with Boidi, but
merely came in the hope of being converted into a
“ champion.”

“Just as over-indulgence results in tiredness
and lameness of the leg muscles, so also are the heart and
respiratory muscles affected. The heart, through in-
creased work put upon it by long, rapid spins, is taxed to
its utmost, and, when persevered in, serious damage to
the heart valves may result. Endurance in prolonged
contests is measured by the capabilities of the heart, and
its essence consists in being able to meet the continuous
tendency to overstep the limits of dilatation.” — Professor
Osier, M.D.

At a cycle meeting held in a Vic. country town
lately the father of one of the competitors in the prin-
cipal race acted as handicapper. And yet his son only
came in second ! A father who can’t help his own off-
spring better than that ought to stay at home. The judge,
however, made up for pa’s blunder by ruling that the
young man won the race. So says Mr. Rice, a member of
the council of the League of Vic. Wheelmen.
• * * *
It may be almost taken for granted in Aus-
tralian bike-racing' that the winner of a championship
trophy is not a champion.
♦ ♦ * *
That ambulance-stretcher at the L.V.W. meet-
ing last Saturday struck one as being brought in chiefly
for theatrical effect. Falls upon the damp, level turf were
not likely to do much damage, and, as a matter of fact,
none of the men who came down could find an excuse for
pretending that they needed to be borne off the track.
But the tragic suggestiveness of the stretcher probably
served a business purpose, especially among female spec-
tators.
« * * *
London Tailor moans plaintively that cycling
tends to lessen the demand for expensive clothes. Men
who were formerly the slaves of Snip now go around all
day in a knicker suit of tweeds, and—says the afflicted
orvan—“ London would be unbearable and uninhabitable
if morning and frock-coats disappeared and tweed were
installed in their place.” That’s true. And all the poetry
would go out of cockney life if the dock-laborers and
other wealthy classes were to abandon the habit of wear-
ing thirty-shilling silk hats. Also the national necessity

A PESSIMISTIC P^IAN.
“ Frank P. Slavin has been badly beaten in all his re-
cent contests in the United States. In a fight at Chicago
his nose was broken, and he is now returning home.”
When all their bonnets filled with bees,
They mostly go across the foam,
And, as each local watcher sees,
They get infected by the breeze,
And find “ where drunken rollers comb” ;
But what we mostly want to see’s
The man who stays away from home.

Mick Dooley wants to meet Joe Goddard once
again. If the pair come together and Michael can be got
into anything like condition, he should win. Joseph
appears to have lost the “ devil ” which characterised his
fighting of old, and it was only Goddard’s whirlwind
rushes and iron determination which roughed Dooley out
of it on both their previous meetings.
Bill Slavm is acting as sparring partner with
Peter Jackson in England, and is said to make a good
showing. When in Australia, William was, without excep-
tion, the poorest boxer to be found about Sydney, and
it sounds like a fairy tale to hear that he has improved to
the extent of making a show set-to with Peter.

N.S.W. Wheelmen’s League will make its best-
planned effort on March 13 and 20 to attract and hold the
interest of the Sydney public ; and all the League can do
between those dates and the present is to pray for sun-
shine. Prizes total £4OO, and the racing, from the
nature of the programme and from the number and
calibre of the competitors, must rival the Zimmerman
carnival for interest. The Zimmerman carnival had the
great support of novelty and a world-admired star. The
forthcoming carnival will have a splendid novelty in its
one-lap scratch races. There are so many men in Aus-
tralia who think they can lick creation for a lap, and,
therefore, in the great majority of the lap races the sprint
will start from pistol-crack. And in the few races where
the sprint may not start with the pistol, the riders can
only crawl for a few seconds. In long races such as 25 miles
or 984 laps, the competitors can crawl for hours, and the
spectators can be bored to death. The longest race in
the forthcoming carnival will be five miles scratch. And
this will be worth going miles to see, partly because the
pacing will be done by singles, so as to give each rider as
good pacing as another, and chiefly because Bilmartin
will wrestle with all the crack new-comers.

Many who have recently bought second-hand
bicycles now anathematise their haste. Six or eight
months ago a “ wheel” in fair condition would sell easily
at anything up to £l3. Several substantial machines are
now on the market, new, at £l2 10s. and upward, and
there is virtually no market for the second-hander.
CRICKET.—THE “ NO-BALL ” GAME.
What seems the same is not the same
Within this world of sin ;
Victoria won a no-ball game,
But not a noble win.

When the Australian team was at Nottingham,
the numerous girls of the lace-factories took the liveliest
interest in each and every member. They wrote letters
to several, and the most daring girls would invent some
pretext for addressing an Australian without the for-
mality of an introduction. One pretty little lace miss
threw herself in the path of the great Giffen, and George’s
theatrical limp had been rather pronounced, so the kind
little girl accosted George with, “Excuse me, Mr. Giffen,
but I merely wanted to inquire if anything serious is the
matter with you?” The Australian all-round cricketer
replied, “ No, little woman ! nothing serious,” and added
by way of facetiousness, “ housemaid’s knee, that’s all! ”
“ Oh, dear! Mr. Giffen ! really! may I ask the house-
maid’s name ? ”
* « * *
SmiterLyons’recent bursts of form are attributed
by many of his fellow cricketers to the steadiness of life
consequent on a happy marriage. Blondin, they say, is a
model husband.
One reason of the recent Australian eleven’s
success was the absence of a skiter. Trott and Gregory’s
splendid stand in the first test-match would have made
swelled head almost excusable in any man, but neither of
the pair ever opened the subject with his fellow mem-
bers of the eleven, or with anyone else. Iredale, too,
after his unprecedented run of big scores, kept modestly
silent. He never referred to his 108 in the second test-
match even, although that innings meant everything to
Iredale. For it gave the lie direct to the many detractors
who were always anxious to assert that the long chap had
little heart. Iredale showed plenty of pluck in England-
taking 36 out of 38 catches in the long field, with all eyes
upon him.
Perhaps the man who showed the most pluck in
England was Donnan. Several of the eleven say, “If
Donnan couldn’t get runs any other way, he got them by
pluck.”
Giffen’s 80 in the second test-match is con-
sidered the best innings this time by an Australian
Eleven man. Iredale, who was the great man’s partner,
says that to watch Giffen compile that 80 was to learn
how to play cricket.
The man who did most work and showed most
activity was “Jonah” Jones. “Rock ’em in” was a
great bowler in England, where the wickets helped him
and brought his lightning ones back with deadly effect.
And when they missed he didn’t swear or cry or sulk
—he just plugged in for a rib or a wicket next over, or, if
fielding, streaked like an emu for the boundary. A strong
goer is Jonah—probably out of the many thousand men
who watched him in England there were not half-a-dozen
who could have come into the field and “ mixed it ” with
him.
The best fieldsman the Australians met in Eng-
land was Mordaunt, of Oxford. He would field a red-hot
ball, knock the wicket down, turn a double somersault,
and dance a break-down, all in the space of 3sec.
In the Australians’ first match with Yorkshire,
Hirst, the county bowler, knocked about the visitors in
the first innings; fast balls from him struck gruelling
blows on batsmen’s arms, legs, bodies. And whenever a
struck player squirmed round, the fair-play crowd of
Yorkshire clodhoppers, wallopers and oafs grunted,
squealed and chuckled in ecstasy of applause. By and
bye, Yorkshire’s first innings began. The crowd saw
Jonah Jones run up to the crease, but it never saw the
ball. It saw a winged batsman fluttering round the
wicket, and it heard the shriek of the strong Englishman
in his agony. And the deadly work went on. New
stumps were brought, new bats, new batsmen, to fill the
gaps of the broken up and slain. The crowd couldn’t
stand it ; the crowd roared with a din that threatened a
riot: “Tak um off ! play fair cricket! don’t kill men!”
To please them Jones was taken off, and the crowd heaved
a sigh of relief, deep and loud as the sigh of the ocean.
But Eady was put on instead of Jones, and Eady’s first
ball, a terrific wind-jammer, struck Hirst himself a
sickenin’ thud. “ Oh-h-h,” bellowed the Yorkshire herd
in agony. “Tak um off, too! That ’s bad as
t’other.”
Three swagmen died on the track within
70 miles of Broken Hill during the awful heat of
Xmas and Boxing days. One was “unknown,”
another was supposed to be somebody, only the
third was really identified. One man died on the
very edge of a tank, another just in sight of what
he had crawled for many hours to reach.
What will they do with it ? Last week,
at Sydney, someone in authority condemned about
15cwt. of tea to be destroyed as unfit for human
consumption. Accordingly, it was emptied out
at Mt. Rennie rubbish-tip, where dozens of men,
women, and children eagerly gathered it up in
bags and tins from among the odorous rubbish
and trekked joyfully citywards.
Although both N.S.W. political parties
ostentatiously disclaim any attempt to introduce
party feeling into the Federal Convention election,
all the same there will be a big under-current
struggling to down Reid, and put Barton and
O’Connor as far up the poll as possible. All the
political enmity Reid has aroused by his policy,
and all the dissatisfaction daily growing against
Freetraders, will be concentrated upon “Jolly and
Fat.”
Writes a Melbourne correspondent :
“ With regard to titles in general and Turner’s
m particular: he ought to have consulted his
party before accepting the bauble, for what-
ever happens to him, the small-fry will have to
suffer in the electorates. That is proved by the
downfall of Bibbs, Stout, Berry, Patterson, and
others with their parties. Their decline began
from the title. In a case of Turner’s kind, he had
probably the choice of consulting his wife or his
political party. He was bound to consult one or
other, if not both, from the result, one gathers
that he consulted his wife. Hence the title. Now
we shall see whether his example will swell the
averages of political downfall through Imperial
branding, or whether he will be the exception
which proves the rule.”

The Strange Story of the
Smuggled JPills.
A representative of the Stoke Newington and
Islington Recorder writes Seldom have I
come across a more remarkable experience than
that related to me a few days since by Mr. John
Cole, of 46 Cressington-road, Stoke, Newington.
Mr. Cole, a well-built man of thirty-seven years
of age, was anxious rather than otherwise that the
facts should be universally known. The manner
in which he told them stamped the tale
With the Impress op Truth.
“ I must tell you,” Mr. Cole began, “ that the
smuggling of which you have heard was not an
ordinary case, but was occasioned by the fact that
I was ill. My illness was both mental and physi-
cal. I had been in one situation for about 20
years, and, leaving, I found it more difficult than
I had imagined to obtain other employment.
Constant disappointments depressed me to a. very
considerable extent. I could not sleep at nights,
my appetite failed, and I fell into a low, despon-
dent state. I wanted to be left alone, and
would walk for miles aimlessly about. Indeed,
my whole nervous system seemed completely
shattered, and my friends thought that I had be-
come very strange in my manners. I had become
so weak that I could scarcely stand, and began to
have terrible pains in my head. I became an out-
patient at an infirmary, but one day I was taken
to a Lunatic Asylum.”
Mr. Cole did not like the asylum, continues the
reporter. The pains in his head became worse, he
could not sleep, and frequently sat up all night
holding his head between his hands.
“ After I had suffered this misery for about
three months,” continued Mr. Cole,
“ my Wife Smuggled
in to me a box of pills. Mrs. Cole had been told
by a neighbor of the wonderful efficacy of Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People, and was
anxious to do anything she could to relieve me of
the terrible pains from which I suffered.
“I was very dubious,” Mr. Cole frankly ad-
mitted, “ but certainly found relief from the first
box. I began to sleep, the weak and trembling
state of my limbs was to a great extent diminished,
and the pains in the head were not so frequent.
When I had taken the third box I was so much
improved in health that 1 asked to be set to work
about the wards, and
Daily I Grew Stronger
under the benign influence of Dr. Williams’ Pills.
I continued to take an occasional dose, and in six
weeks I was as well as lam to day. My health
and mental condition were such that the medical
officer saw no further ground for my detention,
and I once more became a free man.”
It is not only in cases like those described above,
however, that Dr. Williams’ Pills are so valuable.
They have cured paralysis, locomotor ata,xy, rheu-
matism, and sciatica ; also all diseases arising from
impoverishment of the blood, scrofula, rickets,
chronic erysipelas, consumption of the bowels and
lungs, anaemia, pale and sallow complexion,
general muscular weakness, loss of appetite, pal-
pitations, pains in the back, nervous headache,
early decay, all forms of female weakness, and
hysteria. These Pills are a tonic, not a purgative.
They are genuine only with the full name, Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People, and are sold

THIS Company is being formed to acquire the well-known Melbourne United Mines, at 1.0. U.
(Bulong) held under leases No. E 504 (now 36 Y) and 330 E (now 11 Y), and known respectively
as the Light of Europe and the Arbroth, aggregating 18 acres. The Queen Margaret lode has been
proved in the Melbourne IJmted by developments, almost identical with those in the Queen Margaret, as
will be seen by the accompanying plan.
An underlay shaft is down 175 ft., and
is connected with No. 2 underlay shaft
by a drive of 193 ft. long at the 90ft.
levels. The North shaft is down 50ft.,
and altogether there is 410 ft. of driv-
ing done, and about 130 ft. of cross-
cutting, proving the lode in the
dimensions stated. The Eastern lode
is proved at about the same width as
the Queen Margaret, i.e., 30ft. On
the footwall side the stone is of only
a few pennyweight grade, but towards
the hanging wall the rich stringers of
quartz and iron become wider and
more numerous in their occurrence,
making the lode a payable one through-
out.
Arrangements can be made for the
lease of 10 head of Stampers from the
Bulong Mining Tramway and Ore Re-
duction Company Limited, whose plant
is in course of erection and will
660 ft.
shortly be completed. The contract
with the Mining- Tramway and Ore Reduction Company will include the free transport
of Ore from the mine to the Battery on the railway now being laid for the Company, which
will also crush for the White Horse Company, whose Mine occurs between the Melbourne United and
the Quefe been reported on by Mr. Simpson, Manager of the Queen Margaret Mine, and Mr.
T. Hewitson, Manager of the Ivanhoe Mine, and in their opinion the mine is an excellent property.
Following are the results of eight tests of Ore from the various levels made by Professor H.
Rowley, of St. George’s Terrace, Perth.

An agreement dated January 6th, 1897, has been signed between Randolph Bedford and Tolhurst,
Keats and Cumming, on behalf of the proposed Company, and can be inspected at the office of the
solicitors.
Upon the formation of the Company a meeting will be held for the purpose of passing the Memo
randuin and Articles of Association, and the election of Directors, &c.
Dated at Melbourne this 6th day of January, 1897.
Report of Capt. SIMPSON,
MANAGER OF THE QUEEN MARGARET MINE.
Received by Wire, January 6th, 1897.
To Randolph Bedford, Melbourne, —
Have carefully inspected your property situated at Bulong, known as Melbourne United, and beg
to report thereon as follows Your property consists of two blocks, namely six and twelve acres, and
is situated due north of, and adjoining the White Horse Mine, the latter adjoining the Queen Margaret
on the north. A costeen has been sunk on a nice looking ironstone outcrop, from which very rich gold
has recently been taken, and samples forwarded to Melbourne. On block number five hundred and
four, which is the south block, and consists of twelve acres, two shafts have been sunk. Number one
shaft is on the underlie, and is down to depth of one hundred and seventy-seven feet. Drives north
and south, and crosscuts east and west, have been driven from each level, opening up large areas of
payable ore, bearing precisely the same characteristics as on the Queen Margaret. Number three shaft is
situated five hundred feet north of number one. It is down to a depth of fifty feet, and from it drives,
north forty feet, and south one hundred feet, have been put in—the last twenty feet have been driven
in lode formation. On block number three-thirty, consisting of six acres, number two shaft has been
sunk to a depth of ninety feet. A drive south has been put in eighty-five feet. A crosscut east from
the end of this drive has been driven thirty-five feet across the lode formation. High grade samples
were taken from the various levels and crosscuts and gave highly satisfactory results, the average being
three-and-a-half ozs. to the ton. About a thousand feet in sinking, driving, and crosscutting has been
done. There is a plentiful supply of timber surrounding the property, and water can be obtained at a
depth of two hundred feet. In conclusion I have pleasure in stating that from the excellent position of
your property and the fact that the Queen Margaret lode traverses its entire length, and that you have
large bodies of payable ore already opened up, 1 have no hesitation in stating that given systematic
and careful management, the mine will, in the near future, be classed amongst the dividend paying
mines of this colony.
F. SIMPSON,
Bulong, 1.0. U., W.A. Manager, Queen Margaret Mine.
Report by Capt. T. HEWITSON,
MANAGER INYANHOE MINE.
To Randolph Bedford, Melbourne. Received by wire, 9th January, 1897.
Have examined your property, The Melbourne United Mine, at Bulong, consisting of two leases of
twelve and six acres respectively, and situated adjoining the White Horse and Queen Margaret Mines.
The surface contour shows a gold-bearing outcrop intermixed with ironstone, traversing the greater
part of the three properties ; lode characteristics being very similar to Queen Margaret, and in places
is 35 feet thick. It is a contact lode interlaced with quartz veins running into the hanging wall of lode.
These intersections frequently show very rich ore. Trials from the kaolin, a short distance from the
veins, show the ore to be of poorer grade. A good deal of development work has been done. Three
shafts are sunk, one is fifty feet deep, another is ninety feet, and the third is one hundred and seventy-
five feet deep.
Four levels have been opened up at fifty feet, ninety feet, one hundred and fifty feet and one
hundred and seventy feet deep respectively. I have taken a great number of samples, showing from a
trace to seven ounces per ton, and the average is about two-and-a-half ounces. The property is well situ-
ated for mine timber and water, and with good machinery and judicious management I deem it
promising property.

Irritating and Oisfiguring
ERUPTIONS
On the Face, Cured by
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Remarkable Experience of Miss Dorothy
Maher, Fitzroy, Victoria, whose portrait
we are privileged to give below:
“ I take pleasure in testifying to
the great benefit I derived from
Ayer's Sarsaparilla. I suffered
from eruptions on my face of a very
irritating and vexatious nature.
For a considerable time I experi-
mented with various so-called blood
medicines, but without any allevia-
tion of my trouble. At last, your
famous Sarsaparilla being strongly
recommended to me, I began to use
it, and after taking two bottles it
was most gratifying to see and feel
the effect in allaying the irritation
and reducing the eruptions. When
1 had used three bottles the erup-
tions disappeared altogether, with-
out leaving a mark on my face, and
I have never been troubled with
anything of the kind since.”

Dear Bulletin, — “With a groan, he
sprang to his feet, and dropped his pen as if it were
a serpent.” That quote is from a book of stories by
Lilian Quiller Couch, a near relative of “Q.,”
who ought to have known better. A considerable
experience in handling snakes has convinced me
that about the last thing to do with a serpent is
to drop it. “ Hold on for all you’re worth ! ” is
the better advice. I speak as one having authority,
for I have had the pleasure of gripping and box-
ing, among others, an escaped female copperhead
at full term of pregnancy, and the temper of that
kind of wriggler is indescribable. If you happen
to hold a snake, hold it hard and hold it tight—
especially if you are within four walls. If you
have it by the neck, it can’t slew round to bite
your hand. If you have it about the middle, the
chances are about a million to one that it bites I
through a coat-sleeve or shirt-sleeve, which will j
absorb at least two-thirds of the poison, and that |
you will only be a bit frightened and inclined to
be sick. If you have it by the tail somewhere, even
that is better in some cases than not having it at
all. Loose snakes shoot for dark holes, and
trouser-legs attract them. That Family Herald
metaphor of dropping anything “ as if it were a
serpent ” has got to go. With all venomous
snakes, and venomous snakes are comparatively
small, the proper text is : “ Hold hard and hold
tight.” But with pythons, boas, and the big
Queensland non-venomous snakes (say all snakes
over 5ft.), get out and get quickly. One man
I know had such a snake by head and tail. He
wasn’t a bit afraid of it, but when it, in its strug-
gles, got its body looped round his neck, he got a
very fair exhibition of what slow strangulation
feels like.—Yours, J.S.R.

Writes a Thursday Island (Q.) correspon-
dent : —The extinction of the Australian by the
Chow and the Jap. is getting on remarkably well
in these parts, and the heathen in his blindness
grows self-assertive. Some days back two white
men from the south obtained a permit from the
Divisional Board to run a humble show—a steam
riding-gallery—on a piece of land fronting “our
harbor.” They opened to fair business, and de-
cided to remain till the divers and the crews of
the pearl-fleet came in. Then it occurred to the
Jap. and Chow storekeepers, likewise the fan-tan
sharks and the pak-ah-poo men and the Asiatic
brothel-keepers, that this little show might take
some of the money that would otherwise come
their way, and they presented an indignant peti-
tion demanding its removal and the summary
ejection of the two showmen. One publican, the
local garbage-man, and sundry white loafers
backed up the petition. So it has come to this, that
the nigger now demands the chucking of the Aus-
tralian out of his own country because he is in
the nigger’s road. The petition was rejected, and
the wildly-astonished heathen withdrew to con-
sider the matter ; the idea of a white man not
being thrown out when the Jap. and Chow
interest of Thursday Island demanded it was so
novel that it struck the idolator all of a heap, and
he couldn’t assimilate the fact all at once. But
things are only in their early stages ; when they
fully realise the situation the Chow and Jap. will
elect each other to the Divisional Board, and do
their own chucking out, and by-and-bye a Mongol
policeman will arrest the white man for sneezing
in the presence of Joss. The good time is coming.

■ - - MIRACULO7S CURES.
A. few words as to the progress and growth in
public favour of the Registered Alfahne Herbal
Remedies would not be out of place here, and
would be additional evidence as to their real
genuineness and great virtues as claimed for them
by Herr Rassmussen, their discoverer and sole
proprietor.
The great virtues of the Alfaline Herbal Reme-
dies are so well known that it is quite unnecessary
to say much in regard to them in this notice ; the
very fact of their having been before the public
for so many years, and continually growing in
popularity, is quite sufficient evidence that they
are all they are claimed to be. Taking into con-
sideration the fact that they have been awarded
the Parisian Gold Medal, and that so many thou-
sands of original and unsolicited testimonials have
been received, and may be seen at the Head Office,
some of which appear in his pamphlets, there
should be no difficulty in predicting a great future
for these health-giving Remedies unprecedented
m the History of Herbal Remedies.
About twelve years ago Herr Rassmussen intro-
duced these Remedies to the Australian public by
opening a Depot for their sale at 547 George
Street, Sydney, N.S.W., his present Head Office,
and although at that time he did not advertise in
any journal, the wonderful virtues of these Reme-
dies were known far and wide within a few
months. Orders for them came from every
quarter, not only from all the Australian colonies,
but from all over the world. In 1891 the clamour
for the Alfaline Herbal Remedies had become so
great that it became impossible to supply everyone
from the Sydney Depot. Letters arrived by thou-
sands, many orders came by telegraph, and some
people even travelled over a thousand miles to
make sure of obtaining some of these God-inspired
Remedies. What was to be done ? It was Herr
Rassmussen’s duty to see that every sufferer from
the Blood, Skin, N erves, Liver, and other affec-
tions, whose very life and happiness depended on
these Remedies, should be able to obtain same
without undue delay. Herr Rassmussen had thus
no other alternative than to open Branch Depots
for the sale of the Alfaline Remedies in every
colony, and, if possible, in every country in the
world, as he desired to keep the sale of his Herbal
Remedies in his own hands entirely, and thus
avoid the agency of chemists, who generally have
a substitute which they prefer to sell instead of
the real article. A start was made at once in that
direction, and a very large and palatial Depot
was opened at 150 Bourke Street, Melbourne, in
1891. Immediately after, a fine Branch was
established at 154 Rundle Street, Adelaide, fol-
lowed by the opening of an extensive Branch at
91 Lambton Quay, Wellington, New Zealand. A
large Branch was then established at the corner of
Hay and William Streets, Perth, W.A., and
shortly after another Branch, next to Coolgardie
Hotel, Bailey Street, Coolgardie, and N 0.2 Lin-
dell’s Chambers, Hannan street, Kalgoorlie, W.A.,
not to forget the very extensive Branch opened
some seven years ago at 100 Queen Street, Bris-
bane, which is now the Head Depot for Queens-
land, and finally a Branch just opened at Charters
Towers, North Queensland.
It is not unreasonable to ask, “Is it possible
such success should follow unless these well-known
Herbal Remedies are all they are claimed to be,
and is it likely that their popularity .should keep
growing to such an extent, unless they contained
exceptional virtues out of the common ? ” The
evidence that Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal Remedies
contain wonderful virtues is simply overwhelming,
as he possesses thousands of Testimonials to that
effect.
The whole of these Branches are each doing a
large and flourishing business. There is not a
country on the face of the globe where these Re-
medies have not been heard of, and orders arrive
daily from the uttermost parts of the earth.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. IJEARNE. —Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. 1 tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success. I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tam worth, N.S.W.”
We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed

“Papa’s Hair.”
4
A gentleman has sent us the following :—“ A few
weeks ago I bought a bottle of your ‘ Papa’s Hair,’
and it has acted with the most satisfactory results.
Previous to doing so, my hair had a mousey color
streaked with grey. The dear children would try
to count papa’s grey hairs, but, because of the
number, could not succeed. Being only 44 years
of age, I determined to improve my hair, and tried
your ‘ Papa’s Hair,’ and am pleased to write that,
though at first there seemed little difference, gradu-
ally the hair regained its original color (there was
no dyeing whatever) and it is now strong and glossy.
I asked ini' little daughter this morning to count
my grey hairs, but when looking for them she cried
out —‘Why, papa, there are no white hairs; mamma
must have pulled them all out.’”
This Preparation is not a Dye, but acts gradu-
ally on the Roots of the Hair, and restores Grey
Hair to its natural color and lustre.
No preparation will make hair grow better than
“Papa's Hair."
It effectually prevents the formation of Dandriff,
as it is called, the presence of which always denotes
diseased action in the cuticle of the scalp, causing
premature baldness, or a falling off of the hair.
DIRECTIONS.—WeII shake the bottle, and with
a small piece of sponge rub into the roots of the
hair, night and morning, till the hair is restored to
its natural color ; afterwards apply twice a week.

tall upon a scythe, the great median nerve and the
brachial artery of a gardener’s arm were cut
through, with the result that on healing of the
wound the arm withered and was useless, he has
replaced the damaged part of the nerve by 2|in.
ot the spinal cord of a freshly-killed rabbit, with
the result that full sensation has been restored in
the whole limb and hand. The patient works as
well as anybody—digging, wheeling a barrow,

did in his life. This is the first recorded case of
a brute’s spinal cord replacing a human nerve.

A few years ago (writes “The Tramp”)
the overseer of an out-station and I were droving
some cattle in the country between the Darling
and Warrego in the vicinity of Bourke, and were
crossing a large plain traversed by a wire-fence.
On the far side of the plain we could just see a
man riding along. Suddenly he began to gallop
all he knew—up and down, doubling and re-
doubling on his tracks. Then he went straight at
the wire-fence and cleared it —then along the fence
and ou t of sigh t beh ind a bri galo w scru b. “Them an’s
gone off his chump,” said the overseer. “ Anyhow,
I’m not going to leave this mob and follow him.
We got to the head-station that night, and met a
boundary-rider who had come in. “ Who’s the
maniac that was riding like hell over the
plain, and jumped that wire-fence?” “ It was
me,” said the boundary-rider. “Come and have
a look at what I nailed.” We went up to the hut
and saw sitting between the cook and two station
hands a ghastly raving idiot, chewing a chop-
bone. “ That’s what I was after. I was coming
across by the large melon-patch and saw his nibs
munching a hunk of pie-melon and taking off his
clothes. I said to myself, ‘ He’s gone off it,’ so I
gave chase and away he went with only his shirt
and boots on. He went so fast that a ten-pound
shot wouldn’t have kept the tail of his shirt down.
I chased him up and down, and finally he made
for the fence and got through it. It took me some
time to catch him ; he could run like a deer.
At last I brought him in ; and that’s him.” The
man had gone off his head, and had stripped off
his clothing, the weight of which becomes intoler-
able when a fellow is in that state. In five days
he was right, but he had aged very much. The
next time I saw him he was dead. Riding
home one night through a lignum patch, my horse
shied and threw me up against a coolabah. I
couldn’t see or smell anything. It’s strange how
a horse knows a dead from a sleeping man. I got
down and looked about, and saw the man of the
melon-patch lying on his back with his coat folded
up under his head—as stiff as a poker.” “Poi-
soned ! ” said the overseer when he saw him, and
he reckoned he knew the shanty where the poison
was brewed

The Dream of Margaret.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It fell upon a summer night;
The village folk were soundly sleeping,
Unconscious of the glamor white
In which the moon all things was steeping ;
One window only showed a light;
Behind it, silent vigil keeping,
Sat Margaret, as one in trance—
The dark-eyed Daughter of the Manse.
A flood of strange, sweet thoughts was surging
Her burning heart and brain within.
At last, some secret impulse urging,
She laid aside her garment thin,
And, from its snowy folds emerging
Like Lamia from the serpent-skin,
She stood before her mirror bright,
Naked and lovely as the Night.
- Her dark hair o’er her shoulders flowing
Might well have been a silken pall
O’er Galatea’s image glowing
To life and love : she was withal—
The lamplight o’er her radiance throwing—
With her high bosom virginal,
A Woman made to madden men,
A Cleopatra born again.
Hers was the beauty dark and splendid,
Whose spell upon the heart of man
Falls swiftly as, when day is ended,
Night falls in lands Australian.
Her rich, ripe, scarlet lips, bow-bended,
Smiled as such ripe lips only can ;
Her eyes, wherein strange lightnings shone,
Were deeper than Oblivion.
With round white arms, whose warm caress
No lover knew, raised towards the ceiling,
She looked like some young Pythoness
Th ; secrets dark of Fate revealing,
Or goddess in divine distress
To Higher Powers for help appealing.
This invocation, standing so,
She sang in clear, sweet tones, but low :
Soul, from this narrow,
Mean life we know,
Speed as an arrow
From bended bow !
Seek, and discover,
On land or sea,
My destined lover,
Where’er he be.
Howshalt thou know him,
My heart’s desire?—
His mien will show him,
His glance of fire.
High is his bearing,
His pride is high,
His spirit daring
Burns in his eye.
Birds have done mating;
The Spring is past;
My arms are waiting,
My heart beats fast.
“ Oh, why,” she sighed, “ has Fate awarded
This lot to me whose heart is bold?
My days by trifles are recorded,
My suitors men whose God is gold.
O for the Heroes helmed and sworded,
The lovers of the days of old !
M ho broke for ladies many a lance,
1 n those brave days of old Romance.
“ Would I had lived in that great time when
A lady’s love was knight’s best boon ;
When sword with sword made ringing rhyme
when
Mailedsiea-kings fought from noon to moon,
And thought the slaughter grim no crime, when
The prize was golden-haired Gudrun.
Then 1 might find swords broad and bright
And keen as theirs for me to fight.
But narrow bounds my life environ,
And hold my eager spirit in.
1 he men I see no heart of fire in
I heir bodies bear. My love to win
A man must have a will of iron,
A. soul of flame. Then sweet were sin,
Or Death for him ! ” With ardent glance
lhus spake the Daughter of the Manse.
Then with a smile she fell asleep in
ller white and dainty maiden bed.
a c ,G e ’ <; °M moon, alone, could peep in
And view her tresses dark outspread
1 U? n an arm whose clasp might keep in
I he life of one giv’n up for dead.
oPc-’i as ie drifted down the stream
ut blumber deep, she dreamt a dream.
dt a banquet rich and rare,
I he wine of France was foaming madly ;
lhe proud and great of earth were there,
A_nd all ner slaves, who served her gladly
And yet on them with haughty air
bhe gazed, half-scornfully, half-sadly ;
lhe Lady of the Feast was she—
So ran her strange dream-fantasy.
A Prince sat at her fair right hand,
A- n d at her left a famous Leader
Of hosts, with look of high command,
And—blacker than the tents of Kedar—
An Eastern King, barbaric, grand,
Sat near their Queen they had decreed her.
Below the proud, the brave, the wise
Sat charmed by her mesmeric eyes.
Then thus she spake, “ O Lords of Earth !
ihough there may be none nobler, braver
ihan ye—your frame, and rank, and birth,
And wealth in my sight find small favor,
I or all too well I know their worth—
• Long since for me they lost their savor.
I he Spirit, fit to mate with mine,
Must be demoniac—or divine.
“ A toast! ” she cried. The gallant throng
ff Sprang up, their foaming glasses clinking.
“ Satan ! The Spirit proud and strong !
The bravest lover to my thinking !
The Wine of Life I’ve drunk too long:
The Wine of Death I now am drinking 1 ”
“ Our Queen she was a moment since—
Bear forth the body ! ” said the Prince.
She heard the words, for by some Law
Inexorable of our being,
The soul, devoid of sacred awe,
That, from its body Cain-like fleeing,
Goes hence—may not from earth withdraw
Without that murdered body seeing,
And gazing on its cold, dead eyes.
So Margaret learnt in strange dream-wise.
A ghostly wind arose, all wet
With tears, and full of cries and wailing,
And wringing hands, and faces set
In bitter anguish unavailing.
It bore the soul of Margaret
To where a Voice, in tones of railing
Cried, “ Spirit proud ! Thou hast done well.
Thou art within the Gates of Hell! ”
The soul of Margaret drifted slowly,
Yet bravely, through the Hall of Dread,
The roof whereof was hidden wholly
By black clouds hanging overhead.
No sound disturbed the melancholy
Deep Silence —which itself seemed dead.
No wailing of the damned was heard,
No voice the fearful stillness stirred.
But that deep silence held in keeping
The secret of Eternal Woe—
That yet seemed like a serpent creeping
Around the walls. It was as though
The cries of pain and hopeless weeping
Had died out ages long ago.
No face was seen, no figure dread . . .
Were all the damned and devils dead ?
No lustre known on earth was gleaming
In that dread Hall, but some weird light
Around the pillars vast was streaming,
And down the vistas infinite ;
A light like that men see in dreaming,
And, waking, shudder with affright.
Its glare a baleful splendor shed
For ever through the Hall of Dread.
Then suddenly she was aware
That from the walls, and all around her,
In motionless and burning stare,
Millions of eyes glowed, that spellbound her ;
The everlasting dumb despair
That spoke from them made Pity founder
And, as she passed along the floor,
She trod on burning millions more.
For floor and pillar, roof and all
Were full of eyes, for ever burning—
’Twas these that lit the Dreadful Hall,
These were the Damned beyond returning,
Sealed up in pillar, floor, and wall,
Without a tongue to voice their yearning,
Or grief, or hate —so God might know :
Their eyes alone could speak their woe.
Her way lit by the weird light flowing
From those sad, awful eyes, she passtd
To where —her terror ever growing—
Upon a Throne, in fire set fast,
And like a Rose of fire far-glowing,
She saw a Figure, Veiled and Vast.
She trembled, for she knew full well
She stood before the Lord of Hell.
And then, an instant courage taking,
She knelt before the burning throne;
And there in accents clear, though quaking,
She cried “ O Lord, make me thine own !
For men, though they be of God’s making,
I love not. Thee I love alone.”
The figure veiled spake thus: “ Arise !
O Spirit proud—and most unwise.”
And as It spake, unveiling slowly,
A brow of awful beauty shone
On Margaret’s soul—yet Melancholy
And Woe Eternal sat thereon.
But, lo ! the form was Woman wholly.
A faint smile played Her lips upon,
As in a voice low, sweet, and level
She said “My dear, lam the devil *
With one wild wail of hate and scorning,
The stricken soul of Margaret fled.
“ Ah, me ! ” she cried, “ I’ve had my warning. ’
And, shrieking, through the Hall of Dread
She passed. . . . and woke . . . and it vv; s
morning.
And she was in her own white bed.
VICTOR J. DALEY.
Dear Bulletin, —A par. in your issue of
Dec. 26 reminds me of a German Charley I knew
on the Murchison (W.A.) field three years ago.
He started overland from Cue to Coolgardie (over
200 miles) wheeling a barrow containing pro-
visions, tools, &c., and expecting to do the journey
in about three weeks. Less than half-way through
he overtook a done-up, tuckerless tramp, and with
characteristic good nature told him to “dump”
his swag on top of the barrow and he’d see him
through. Two or three days later the “ pas-
senger ” knocked up altogether, and Charley
dumped him also on the barrow and so trundled
him into Coolgardie. Needless to say this Charley
was also “‘an unobtrusive guttural wanderer,”
and his heart—well, he was all heart! — Bolton.
Maria Island, East Coast (Tas.), much of
which is splendidly fertile, has had a chequered
career. Originally a convict settlement—an epoch
perpetuated by many still-existent buildings—it
reverted to peaceful pastoral pursuits till about 12
years ago, when an Italian gentleman got it from
Govt, for 10 years at a nominal rent, he under-
taking to establish silk and wine industries and
securing many concessions. A co. was formed
in Melb., about .£OOOO expended in buildings,
steamer, &c., and everyone had a good time while
it lasted. When the capital was expended there
was nothing to work on. The vineyards “ petered ”
out, and silk was an unknown quantity. Then
the promoter came along with a new scheme. It
was proposed to manufacture cement from the
extensive deposits on the island. An ineffectual
attempt was made to “place it” in London.
Then Parliament was asked to renew the original
lease for another 10 years, and to vote £2OOO as a
bonus to be paid when a certain quantity of
cement was produced. This passed the Assembly,
but the Upper House rejected it. The original
Maria Island Co. owes nearly £lOOO for rent,
having paid none, whilst it has sub-let portions of
the island for agricultural and pastoral purposes.
The Govt, has foregone rent at £3OO per annum
(which sum was formerly paid by tenants) for 12
years, and the prospect of another 10 years was
too much for Upper members. People now
await the co.’s next move.
According to New York Tribune —and
the Jearnes correspondent of that alleged demo
cratic journal seems to speak truth—Queen Vic-
toria’s fondness for fussing over her favorite flun-
keys is as strong as ever. Next to A. Brown,
stationed at the royal elbow in succession to John
of that ilk, Victoria Regina esteems Thomas
Sands, the quite unremarkable old retainer who
drives her carriage on all ordinary occasions.
Thomas isn’t the state coachman. The state
coachman lives in London and doesn’t sit in
front of his monarch oftener than once in ever}'
five years, or so, on an average. Thomas is the
every-day identity to whom the Queen says “ Good
day ” before being hoisted into the chariot, and it
is during the quiet drives around Windsor and
Balmoral that Thomas looms largest as an object
of royal solicitude. Sometimes he has to bring
the ’orses to a standstill in order that the old
lady may get a pot of tea made for her
by the women-in-waiting, who carry a spirit-
lamp and kettle to that end Then Thomas,
as boss male person present, comes in for
a drop of the only liquor that’s going. To
pour out a cup of tea for the coachman is Her
Majesty’s principal dissipation nowadays. The
tale goes that when the ex-Empress of Germany,
out driving with her august relative one after-
noon, started to prepare a drink for the bloated
menial on the box-seat, V.R. snatched the cup
away from her eldest-born, remarking that she
alone understood the yearnings of Thomas as
regards sugar and cream. The Bulletin is much
touched by this evidence of Her Majesty’s
motherly regard for her coachman. It reflects
great credit upon the Queen as a woman, and
sheds a new halo around the monarchial institu-
tion, in a manner of speaking. Anyway, it goes
to prove that Thomas wouldn’t be nearly as happy
and contented under a Republican form of
Government.

“The Men that Blazed the
Track": A Toast.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Since the toasts for the Absent are over,
And duly we’ve pledged in our wine
Our Land, and our Friends, and our Lover,
Here’s a toast for you, comrades o’ mine !
To the fighting band that won the land
From the bitterest wastes out-back !
From, hut and hall to the kings of all —
“ The men who blazed the track ! ”
We have fashioned the cities behind them
With pride in our cunning and skill,
We are forging the railways to bind them
And finding the people to fill;
We are tilling the land they passed over,
And spreading our world to the west,
And the gold that belongs to the rover
Is filling the hands of the rest.
The fingers that gripped on the handles
Of axes that burned in the sun
Gleam fleshless and white on the sandhills
Near prizes that never were won.
For gold-reefs may glitter around them,
And house-roofs may shimmer below,
But the soul of the desert has bound them
With fetters no others can know.
They rode away into the forest
In mornings gold-studded with stars,
And the song of the Leaders was chorus’d
To the clinking of rowel and bars,
And they fought for the fame of the islands,
And struck for the Width of the World,
And fashioned new roads in the Silence,
And flags in the fastness unfurled.
Their tents in the evening would whiten
The scrub, and the flash of their fires
Leap over the shadows to brighten
The way of ambition’s desires.
By the axe-marks we followed their courses,
For scarcely the ashes remain,
And the tracks of the men and the horses
Are hidden by dust-storm and rain.
The seasons from June to December
Are buried and born as of old,
But the peoples have ceased to remember
Who won them the laurels they hold.
Vet, sometimes, the north winds come bringing
Those keener of hearing and sight
The music of lost axes ringing—
The beat of lost hoofs in the night.
Our pride is the path of our fathers,
Our hope’s in the sons of our home,
And wherever our nation foregathers
Our nation is foremost to roam ;
But the valleys that smile to our tillage,
The hills where our banners unfold,
Were won by the men of the village,
And bought with their axes of old,
And we only ride with the flowing tide
As we follow the blazed line back,
So ice'll drink the toast of the vanguard host,
And “ The men who blazed the track! ”
GLENROWAN.
A Bridal Tarty and a Bog,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was afternoon when I rode into Bear Gully. I
was bound for the railway-station five miles north,
and at first thought to ride straight through the
almost-deserted hamlet. Bear Gully had once a
dozen or so houses. That was before the railway-
station opened in the north. Now the pub. was
the only inhabited dwelling in the place, and it
lingered partly to catch teamsters and occasional
wanderers, and partly, seemingly, because it was
used to lingering there and never thought of shift-
ing.
The day was hot and steamy after late ram.
Several puddles of water studded the flat in front.
The pub. verandah was odiously dirty. Mud was
spattered on the posts and on the weatherboard
walls, and the entire establishment looked disre-
putable in the extreme. A brown shabby dog of
a mixed collie and retriever breed lay at the far
end of the verandah, and eyed me in a peculiarly
suspicious way. However, throwing the bridle
over a hook, I walked in.
“ Anyone here ? ” I asked. There were glasses
on the counter and bottles on a shelf behind, but
no one in attendance.
“Anyone here?” I repeated. Thinking the
publican might be temporarily busy elsewhere I
turned out of the bar to have a look at the dog,
whose appearance had attracted me.
The brute had partly struggled to his feet and
was snapping at something, to me invisible, which
seemed to annoy him. He w'as as dirty as his
surroundings, large lumps of mud sticking here
and there to his shaggy sides. As I approached
him, in making a particularly vicious snap over
his right shoulder, he overbalanced and rolled on
his back. I went closer. His eyes were shut,
but he moved his head spasmodically and every
few seconds snapped at some unseen enemy. I
judged his complaint to be a kind of local paralysis
combined with illusions of the senses.
Going back I re-entered the bar. To my sur-
prise a red, swollen-faced man sat behind the
counter.
“Hello,” I said, “I thought the house aban-
doned. Isn’t it hot ? ” The man was looking
towards bilt beyond me. His eyes were bloodshot
and the lids heavy.
“What’ll y’ ’ave?” he asked, almost in a
whisper. I wished I had ridden on, but as things
had gone so far I determined to make the best of
them.
“ A little whisky,” I answered. “ It’s terrible
work riding in this clammy heat.” He gripped
the counter with one hand, while reaching for the
bottle with the other. He looked at the bottle as
he looked at me—that is, he appeared to be look-
ing far away beyond it. Catching it, however, he
placed it before me.
“ You don’t seem very well,” I remarked. No
answer.
“ That’s a queer dog of yours outside,” I added.
No answer.
I swallowed the drink and placed a shilling on
the counter. The man put the bottle back, and
picked up the shilling in a dreamy, death-like
silence, and then, with a shout that shook the
rafters, jumped several feet in the air, and, turn-
ing round, rushed through the bar entrance into
an adjoining room. Recovering from the shock,
I followed him. I had heard a crash, and con-
cluded he had fallen over something. He had ;
and there he lay on the floor, evidently injured,
though to what extent I could not tell.
“ What’s up ? ” I asked. He made desperate
efforts to rise, but knee or ankle was damaged and
he could not get on his feet. But he snapped at
me with his mouth, and, when I stood aside out ot
his view, he snapped and struck at objects invisi-
ble to me. .. „ „
“ Who the mischief’s looking after this den .
I mused, walking through the house to the rear of
the premises. In a large room, like a bushman s
dining-room, my eye caught a youngish man, m
shirt and trousers, sitting at a heavy table, en-
gaged at some absorbing work. His face_ was
toward me, and, though he was unshaven and un-
washed, I at once set him down for a city clerk.
“ Well, now,” I began, walking in ; I m glad
to come on someone in his senses. What sup with
the party inside ? ” By this time I noticed that
the heavy wooden table was pitted all over with
small cavities, some the size of marbles, and others
as large as eggcups, and that my new acquaint-
ance was engaged digging out a fresh one with his
sheath knife. He did not notice my words, but
worked on.
“ What do all these holes mean ? ”
“ Sh—sh !” he whispered. “ I’m getting em all
out. Oh, they can’t escape me ! Centipedes
see ? Scorpions—see ? I’m getting ’em out, I m
getting ’em out! ” _
Whipping a wriggling shaving of wood from the
hole he worked on, he threw it on the floor and,
with blood-curdling yells, jumped and danced on
it. When the fit was over he resumed his seat
and went on calmly with his work.
m • • *
As I unhitched my horse the cross-bred collie,
still snapping at the air, wriggled to the edge of
the verandah, and rolled over into a pool of water
on the road beneath.
I didn’t look back. “ I’ll report the facts to
the authorities,” I said, “ and leave the job to
them.” On turning the first bend in the road I
came flush on a horse and trap.
“ Ye’re fram beyant ? ” asked a sergeant of police
who drove the trap. “Did ye lave them all
well?” Then he informed me that he and the
constable sitting beside him were bound for the
Bear pub. to carry away the remaining inmates.
“Ye see,” went on the sergeant, “ we tuk away
the wimmin this marnin’. It all come about
through a weddin’ as done it. The darter of the
oul’ man was spliced three weeks ago to a young
fella, a clerk from town, an’ they kep’ the celly-
brashun up till ivery man jack has the d.t.’s. I
tuk away the bride an’ ’er mother an’ an oul’
woman cook in this thrap this marnin’, an’ now
I’m goin’ back for the oul’ man an’ the bride-
groom. ”
“ And the dog? ” I said.
“ An’ the dog,” said the sergeant. “ The
dog’s ivery bit as bad as the rest. It’s the worst
case of profligacy iver occurred in this part in my
time, an’ the dog’s as bad ’s any wan of them.
This ’ll burst up the Bear pub. anyway, an’ it’s a
good job. Will ye ride back wid us ? ”
“ No, sergeant, thank you. I’m in a hurry.
I’ll not want to see the bridal party or its dog any
more.”

Already, alas ! there are signs of falling
away about Turner, K.C.M.G. The Sunday after
his ennobblement the Yic. Premier wandered on
St. Kiida pier attired in the belltopper of degrada-
tion—probably the first belltopper ever seen on
Turner’s head. The poodle presented to him by
Mrs. Freeman Thomas trotted behind, and those
versed in doggy matters allege that the animal
looked better satisfied with his position than
formerly. The opinion of a ' poodle on such
matters is not to be despised either.
An Idyll of a King,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was midday in Goulburn-street, Sydney, out
side a Chinese grocery-shop, plainly fitted up foi
faro and—behind the cedar partition—fan-tan. A
peripatetic Chow restaurateur had deposited hif
two baskets in the doorway, and was weighing out
greasy pieces of the almost invariable pork upon
which the Celestial bases his existence.
At that moment the last of his tribe (they are
always the last) ambled up. He was grizzled, and
attired magnificently in clerical frock-coat and
battered billycock. I knew him for a king.
Billy (of course his name was Billy) stood with
eyes glistening, and cast meaning glances at the
meat and then at the Chow. He succeeded in
bringing himself under notice.
“Oh, you want a lit’ piecee pig?” suggested
the vendor of pork.
The last of his tribe did not answer, but stood
expectant, whilst the other chopped and sawed at
a bone. The patience of kings is seldom elastic.
Billy made an eager grab at the largest piece
before the chopper was fairly through. It was
quickly snatched back again, and the Chow blas-
phemed in monosyllables.
“ Wha’ for, you damn black thief?” he demanded,
with ostentatious contempt, “ You clear. You no
get it presen lee.”
He shouldered his baskets, but softened, and
placed them upon the pavement again.
“ Here, you take this piece, you poo’ letch.”
He threw a scrag of bone to the ground, where a
king and a lean dog fought hungrily for the charity
offering of a superior product.
THOROLD DALRYMPLE.
A Bulletin correspondent :
“Why are so many women sickly?” is the question
which Dr. O’Sullivan, of Melbourne, finds a palpably
weak answer for. The O’Sullivan replies : “It is because,
living in ludicrous indolence, they cannot allow the duties
of maternity to disturb their social pleasures ; or, perhaps,
weighed down by shiftless povert3 r , they dread the devas-
tating crowd of unwonted children.” In other words,
women are sickly because they take measures to avoid in-
creasing the population at a “ natural rate,” says the
Irish reasoner, and he assumes that the evil result is the
same in the case either of ludicrous indolence or shiftless
(and therefore toilsome) poverty. The woman who stands
at the wash-tub, and the “lady” who lolls on a couch,
must produce several children apiece—or enjoy bad
health. The doctrine may seem sound in Australia,
where females, as a rule, are sickly, and babies are fast
going out of fashion, but it would not bear criticism in
France, whose women have retained their health whilst
reducing the barbarous birth-rate of old down to a
rational average of two children for each married couple.
Moreover, many notorious unsickly women are wives or
widows who have not cared to hamper or over-hamper
their careers with the duties of maternity—instance
Adelina Patti, Sarah Bernhardt, Melba. They are all
right to the same extent that Dr. O’Sullivan is all
wrong. Whatever may be the cause of sickliness in the
sex, it is certain that the complaint cannot be generally
cured by a monotonous sequence of little strangers.
Indeed, the average prolific mother is apt to complain
that she has never been quite well since the birth of her
“last baby but two.”
