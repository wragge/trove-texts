KANGA FORCE
Peter Ryan was one of the handful
of Australian commandos who. link-
ing up with the New Guinea Volunteer
Rifles under the joint title of Kanga
Force, stayed on in New Guinea after
the fall of Lae and Salamaua to main-
tain contact with the natives, harass
the Japanese and report on their move-
ments. He says in Fear Drive My Feet
(Angus and Robertson) that all the
efforts and sacrifices of the force were
“futile” because, for a start, the
authorities wouldn’t give them a radio
to get their news out promptly, and
later, when they did have a radio,
ignored even such important informa-
tion as that the Japanese, preparing to
evacuate Lae, were exploring the
escape-routes over the mountains; but
at least they kept things going when
things were at their worst, and they
set up a legend in New Guinea that
might pay-off handsomely in the
future. Anzac itself was also in a
sense futile.
“Fear Drive My Feet” is an extra-
ordinary story, and, among the present
spate of novels about the war in New
Guinea, welcome for presenting the
absolute authenticity of a first-person
factual account of the author’s adven-
tures. It is the more welcome in that
it has all the clarity of theme and
dramatic development that you would
hope to find in the best of novels. It
is a boy of eighteen, as Ryan then was,
pitted against the jungle and the Japs.
It opens quietly enough as the
young commando is sent with a native
constable and some bearers alone into
three-thousand square-miles of New
Guinea to find a certain Jock McLeod
who was up in the hills somewhere
conducting a one-man war against the
Japs. This is the more-or-less familiar
story of fever, malaria, stinking
swamps, flooded rivers and groups of
commandos camping in outlandish
places: the New Guinea old-hand who
was so glad to get a copy of “The
Bulletin”; Bill Chaffey of the N. S.
Wales Parliament “with an enormous
red beard that made him look like
the prophet Isaiah.”
But, as Ryan meets and prowls the
hills with McLeod, as other lone com-
mandos are betrayed and shot down
or lan Downs climbs a figtree while
the Japs are hunting below it, as Ryan
himself, camping casually on a ridge
within sight of the figtree of Lae,
decides to go down and interview the
Chinese internees, and as the Japs
begin to march their patrols further
and further into the interior, it is a
story of steadily increasing tension. It
mounts into a terrific climax when,
with the enemy closing-in upon them
and the natives hostile, Ryan and his
companion, Les Howlett, were ordered
to leave their territory and, finding it
“impossible and inglorious” to get back
over the Markham, decided to cross
the 13,000 ft. Sarawuged Range “to
see what was happening on the north
side.”
It was spongy going up the range
—“We pushed a sharpened eight-foot
pole full length into the ground with-
out encountering any resistance.” It
was fierce on top and the whole party
was suffering from lack of oxygen: —
The top of the range was a semi-
plateau some six or eight miles
wide, a scene of utter desolation.
A howling wind, with nothing to
break its force, .lashed us pitilessly
as we struggled forward. The great
limestone outcrops seemed like
bones poking through the crust of
the earth. When not struggling
across the treacherous face of the
range we were plodding painfully
through a black, sodden bog of
spongy earth that sucked at our
feet as though it would pull us down
for ever.
When they had lowered themselves
down the precipitous northern side on
their vine-ropes they got a radio
message to say that another of the
commandos, Harry Lumb, had been
killed by the Japs. Then, after many
adventures, including a night in a primi-
tive village where the natives went
“hopping mad” when, of necessity,
they raided their gardens, they them-
selves were betrayed by the natives into
a Japanese ambush in the village of
Chivasing. Howlett was killed and
Ryan, separated from their native
escort, hid in a pig-wallow while the
Japs and the villagers hunted him: —
I lay there motionless, buried
alive in mud and pig-filth, feeling
or imagining creatures of unspeak-
able loathsomeness crawling over
me in the slime. The voices became
fainter and the squelching footsteps
died away.
So, in the darkness, he went on alone
through the thorny bush—“lt was
easier, if more painful, to let them tear
straight through the flesh” —and on
through a solid wall of cane-grass eight-
feet high. He slept a night in a puddle
of mud beside a creek to escape the
mosquitoes; then swam from island to
island across the Markham with the
fear of crocodiles and Japanese
bullets to keep him going; and so,
helped by unwilling natives whom he
encouraged with a pistol, back to com-
parative safety in the camp at Kirk-
land’s.
There are few war-books, fact or
fiction, in which you would read so
tremendous a story; and it is a beauti-
ful anticlimax to it that the next time
we meet Ryan in the jungle, after a
rest-period in Bulolo, he is strolling
along with an American officer named
Tex who wants to build air-strips and
who, though the danger of a Japanese
ambush is still imminent, cannot be
persuaded to stop singing at the top
of his voice.
Two weaknesses at times blur the
impact of the book. One is Ryan’s
habit of occasionally dropping-out of
pidgin when he is reporting conver-
sations with the natives, which destroys
the sense of reality, though it restores
to the natives a strange dignity. The
other is his failure to recapture, six-
teen years afterwards, the exuberance
of youth which must have sustained
him through these stirring events. You
see something of this in momentary
glimpses, when he decides to go down
to Lae and talk to the Chinese
prisoners, or when, resting and ill in
Moresby, he does everything he can
to avoid being sent back to Australia;
but on the whole this is one aspect
of his book where, recreating the spirit
of youth, fiction could be more success-
ful.
But if you don’t see much of the
exuberance, you do, when he bites his
pipe-stem clean through when he is
being buzzed by Beaufighters (whose
pilots thought he was a Jap), or when
he jumps up to shoot the cuckoo-clock
while he is spending the night in a
deserted mission, see some pretty effec-
tive glimpses of the underlying
tension; and the concluding chapters of
the escape over the ranges are so fully

AFTER LUNIK TWO
It was like falling out of love, a wisp
of grief
Identifiable pain, unease, regret
As for the end of summer when a
brilliant feather
Lies on the grass and the bright bird
flown on.
It was a sort of cruelty, a small torture,
A shudder in the skin, and yet
That night the pure moon floated like a
leaf
Moist, pale, and patterned in her familiar
way
Between her stars and clouds, the candid
moon.
No mark of the insolent arrow on her
cheek,
No crimson kiss or tear to show her
wound,
She passed on her dark acres to the deep
Green gulf of day, and so with her
My fears and sorrow into caves of sleep.
N.S.W.

HAVING IT BOTH WAYS
'THE Colombo Plan, which Sir Percy
Spender used to claim as his own,
seems to be a plan to give willingly
but not to receive gracefully.
This perhaps is the fault of the
givers, for it has become the fashion,
set by Russia and followed by the
bedraggled tail of little nations which
form "the bulk of the voting member-
ship of U.N., to paint the givers as
imperialist oppressors who have been
dragged off their spoils and are being
fined an annual amount by way of
reparations to those whom their extor-
tion and brutality ground into the
earth.
In view of these circumstances,
it is remarkable that most of the
“liberated” nations now look for
leadership to those among them who
have been British-educated. They also
adopt British methods of Parliamentary
Government (or at least an imitation
of it) right down to the wearing of
wigs and gowns and the carrying of a
mace before the Speaker. They model
their courts and administration-system
on the British. The Inns of Court are
flooded with Asians and Africans
studying to become members of the
English Bar. In many of the new
countries an English law-degree just
about takes the place of the peerage.
LEW of the “liberated” show much
-*■ thankfulness for what they receive.
Ghana and its official press—no other
being allowed to survive in that land
in which much of the Parliamentary
and other Opposition seems to be in
detention-camps—is shrill about the
right of Ghanaians to be financially
supported by U.K. loans and trade.
But when the United Kingdom recently
presented Nigeria, another African
member of the British Commonwealth,
with a couple of gunboats for mutual
defence and river-patrolling, Nkrumah’s
official daily headed its leading article
about the gift “Despicable Act by
Britain,” and shouted that the U.K.
was “sabotaging peace” with “Nato
shampoolah,” trying to “turn its
colonies into new Pakistans.” No
“attempt, however immoral, no tricks,
however sinister, to impawn the peace-
loving people of West Africa in an
....inextricable web” (this official
journal averred) was too bad for
“criminal imperialist Britain” to try.
Yet this paper is the voice of
Nkrumah, who was arranging to stay
with the Queen at Balmoral about the
time the statement was made, while the
Ghana authorities were hoping that
her Majesty would give the new Royal
baby a Ghanaian name.
'THE attitude of some of the Asian
countries, or many of their leaders,
is more courteous but no more friendly
to those that help feed them. They
snatch rather than receive, often with
a snarl.
The atmosphere at the eleventh
Colombo Plan meeting suggested that
some of the beneficiaries Who most
need help reserve the right to abuse
their benefactors.
Even the delegates of India, whose
Krishna Menon is beginning to reap
the harvest of his open support of
Moscow, had just come from a Can-
berra Parliamentary conference at
which one of them suggested that Aus-
tralia and other countries were bound
to practise austerity in order to give
more help to Asian have-not nations.
The Colombo Plan was originally
intended to be a temporary British
Commonwealth measure to help former
colonies to build their national frame-
works of development. The U.S.A.
joined in 1951. Originally the countries
marked for support were Ceylon, India,
Pakistan, Malaya and British Borneo,
but Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos were
included in 1950, Burma and Nepal
in 1952, Indonesia in 1953 and Japan,
the Philippines and Thailand in 1954.
In 1955 it was decided to extend the
scheme to 1961, Australia’s commit-
ment for the six years being about
£35 million.
'THE heaviest burdens are carried by
the United States, United Kingdom
and Canada. The technical assistance
and training of nationals of the bene-
ficiary countries has been immense.
They have been received freely irres-
pective of color or creed even in Aus-
tralia, where the universities and tech-
nical schools hold considerable num-
bers of them. The member-nations,
givers and receivers, now number
nineteen.
The recent conference was held to
consider the future of the plan, which
has resulted in nearly £A3OOO million
being poured into South-east Asia,
apart from making available 10,000
technicians and experts and educating
18.000 Asian nationals at university
level.
It was decided to extend the scheme
for another five years. As the popula-
tion of the area served is around 650-
700 million, even the vast sum paid
over, including about a third of the
U.S. foreign-aid programme hand-outs,
doesn’t go very far towards improving
living-standards. If Australia were to
hand over the whole of its annual
Commonwealth Budget expenditure it
would represent less than £2 per head
per annum of Asians affected.
It is perhaps not surprising that the
less friendly section of the beneficiary
nations, especially those in close asso-
ciation with Moscow, are grudging in
their acknowledgments and take the
benefits offered them with surly dislike
of the donor.
Soekarno, for instance, when the
future of the Plan was under discussion
at Djogjakarta, dwelt viciously on the
evils of “colonialism” and declared
that Asians were “nauseated” by the
perverted civilisation of the West. He
virtually condemned the Plan as a
Trojan-horse scheme to extend the per-
version of European civilisation to
Indonesia.
TOTS doesn’t prevent hundreds of
Indonesian students, many of whom
have prosperous parents, from accept-
ing the free benefits of British, Ameri-
can and Australian education. Nor is
there any trouble about giving Indo-
nesia Australian buses by the hundred
and railway-engines by the score. And
it didn’t prevent Soekarno suggesting
the enlargement of the scope of the
Plan by the inclusion of the Com-
munist Asian countries, among them
Red China.
British delegates were rather, in-
censed, but New Zealand, which in
recent times could have done with
some Colombo Plan help itself, was
ready to be both forgiving and
generous at other people’s expense by
suggesting enlargements of the plan to
take in Africa and South America.
As it now operates, the Colombo
Plan has little relation to the plan
originally framed as a British Com-
monwealth affair. As a scheme for
developing the latent resources and
unity of purpose of the British Com-
monwealth nations it had definite
direction and purpose. With the entry
of America and the gradual gathering-
in of potential enemies its central
administration has become merely
another of the hundred sprawling
bodies feeding money and help into
the hands of anybody who will oblige
by making jobs for an army of pro-
fessional do-gooders.
People like Soekarno are having it
both ways. They are the friends of
pawns of Communism, restrained only
from moving into the Communist bloc
by the strength and resistance of the
Indonesian Army, but receiving subsi-
dies from those whom the Communists
wish to destroy.

DESIGN FOR AN AUSTERITY CHRISTMAS CARD


PLAIN ENGLISH
The Melting-pot
While the West is gradually coming to
agreements about its line at the Summit
Conference, the Communist world
exhibits a discouraging picture.
Behind Khrushchev’s screen of soft
words, threat and force still lurk in
frightening bulk.
Moscow’s emissaries at U.N. Assembly
meetings suavely talk of the need for
world amity, the brotherhood of man
and universal respect for individual
human rights and dignity. Their repre-
sentatives and stooges echo their senti-
ments at Australian and other “peace”
conferences. Khrushchev begs the West
to allow him to smooth over the difficulties
between India and China oyer Tibet.
But there are two streams of Com-
munist history —the unreal, as painted
in the soft words of the beguilers of
the West, and the real, demonstrated in
the deeds and threats of the same slippery
gentlemen on the home-fronts.
A flaw in the front of Communist
loving kindness was evident last week
when U.N. delegates found themselves
disturbed by well-substantiated reports
that as adolescent Hungarian freedom-
fighters, of the struggle of 1956, reached
the legal age of 18, they were being
executed.
Another flaw was exposed by the docu-
mented evidence of the Dalai Lama
before the International Commission of
Jurists at Mussoorie; it told of genocide,
mass-killings, deportations and mass-
immigration contrived so that the
Tibetans would become a helpless
minority in their own country.
Also in the same week came two
thunderous statements from Moscow, one
from Khrushchev, completely out of key
with his propaganda of the last few
months, and one from the long-silent
deputy, Mikoyan.
Both were to the effect that Russia
has enough H-bombs in store to destroy
the world and “raze all its potential
enemies.” Khrushchev spoke of having
visited a Russian factory where 250 H-
bomb war-heads had been manufactured
on an assembly-line within a year. The
Red Army is “at the height of its invinc-
ible might.”
No one seems to have noticed the
incongruity between these claims and
Russia’s continued assurances that it has
been steadily reducing its forces and
suspending its nuclear tests in the
interests of peace.
Bracketed with these statements was
the assurance —disturbing to anyone who
understands the Communist tactic of
“ebb and flow” —that Moscow officially
rejects the suggestion that Soviet policy
has altered: “We were born Communists,
we live as Communists, and we will not
die, but march as Communists.” Accord-
ing to the theory of Marxism-Leninism,
this means march to the ultimate goal of
world-revolution, inevitably achievable
only by force.
Nearer' to Australia, China and Indo-
nesia seem to have reached a parting of
the ways. After Peking had demanded
that Chinese in Indonesia be exempted
from the general plan to root-out foreign
ownership of commerce, Soekarno,
formerly one of Moscow’s “yes”-men, put
a ban on foreign-owned shops in
country districts. This amounts to the
shutting-out of well on towards a million
Chinese who were ordered by the Army
to quit their villages after the shops were
closed.
With Africa edging away from Mos-
cow, Nasser gone anti-Communist, Iraq
resistant, India disillusioned and the Laos
movement stopped, Communist relation-
ships everywhere seem in a melting-pot.
And this, however suave Moscow may
be about the need for peace, is a very
dangerous and explosive situation.
Millions More Asians
A rather demanding tone underlined
the address by Dr. Dina Rangeneker,
a newspaperman who is currently a
lecturer on Asian affairs at Melbourne
University, to the North-Eastern Rotary
Assembly at Wangaratta (Vic.) when he
described the Colombo Plan as a total
failure.
According to Dr. Rangeneker,
promises of large-scale aid when the
plan was inaugurated had not been
fulfilled ; aid that was given had been
of the wrong kind ; only the U.S. was
giving substantial aid ; and the familiar
cliche was added that Asians would
decide on whichever of Communism
and free-enterprise proved the more
successful method of organisation.
The address to the Rotarians fol-
lowed the publication in Melbourne of
some articles by Osmar White, the Mel-
bourne journalist who had been
seconded to the Department of External
Affairs to write a confidential and inde-
pendent non-governmental report on the
operation of the Plan.
What Osmar White reported to the
department probably will not be dis-
closed, despite Opposition requests for
it in the Reps.; but in his newspaper
articles, which were apparently outlines
of it, he reported that in some areas
the Plan had been successful and in
others disappointing.
White found that machinery had been
misused, neglected or never used at all,
and some of the reasons were that Asian
countries are short of trained mechanics
and machine-operators, inefficient in in-
dustrial management, riddled in the
lower ranks by graft and favoritism,
and, not surprisingly, short of foreign
exchange.
Dr. Rangeneker and Osmar White are
in part-agreement on technical aid. The
Asian described sending technical aid,
instead of money, as like sending a
chef to advise a family unable to afford
food, and the Australian insists that
supervision and sustained follow-up
aid must follow machines.
One of the greatest burdens on the
Colombo Plan, however, can be lessened
by the Asians alone: the increasing
millions of mouths to feed since the
Plan was inaugurated.
The Other Cup
Given the same sort of- press build-
up, the Canada Cup and Inter-
national Trophy might well have
rivalled the Melbourne Cup this year.
The great golfing event drew thousands
each day to Royal Melbourne, without
the aid of betting-charts, handicaps, first,
second and final acceptors and intriguing
reversals of form.
The Melbourne scene for some days
touched Olympic memories, with crowds
of workmen gathered in their lunch-
hours around public TV-sets in shops
and pubs. The explanation may be
that golf, like most other good things,
is no longer the exclusive pastime of
the well-to-do.
The £1 admission-charge and ss.
parking-fee weren’t fixed to attract the
proletariat, but the organisation at
Royal Melbourne was wonderful, and
although 15,000 turned-up on the first
day (it’s estimated that 2000 of ’em got
through the fences), they were smoothly
handled and went home apparently well
content with what they had seen.
This was chiefly the substantial early
lead of the Australians, Thomson and
Nagle ; but many thought Sam Snead’s
eagle at the wicked 17th hole alone was
worth the price of admission, the
strenuous exercise over the greens and
the conniving and manoeuvring for a
vantage-place at the ropes.
Subsequent days were even more
satisfying and Saturday’s gallery had the
thrill of seeing the Australian pair win
the Canada Cup.
The Governor, Sir Dallas Brooks, was
very much in the picture. It was quite
obvious he has become one of “those
sport-mad Australians,” and he legged
it round with the gallery. Once or twice
when he was inside the ropes, his bulk
blocked some of the gallery’s view, but
not after one character objected mildly,
“Fair go, Guv.”
A Smashing Victory
[From Canberra!
The overwhelming support given in a
“free” vote in the House of Represen-
tatives to Barwick’s new Divorce Bill
represented a smashing victory for three
men —P.M. Menzies, Barwick himself,
and Victorian backbencher Percy Joske.
Barwick heatedly denied suggestions by
Laborite Fred Daly that it was a “phony”
free vote, within both the Government
and Labor parties.
The Attorney-General said, and he
had the P.M.’s backing, that no pressure
at all had been put on any member;
each man had been left to vote accord-
ing to his own personal views. These,
apparently, were overwhelmingly in
favor of the legislation, with a large
proportion of Catholic members approv-
ing the bill.
Barwick was at his eloquent best in
explaining the bill in detail in the com-
mittee stages. No one who heard him
could doubt the tremendous amount of


detailed work he had put into the
measure. Not only did he get bouquets
from his own supporters, but from many
Labor members, too, particularly from
the Doc.
No one, however, could have got
greater satisfaction from the bill’s
acceptance than Joske, who introduced
the original private member’s bill seek-
ing a uniform divorce-code. The legis-
lation, as passed by the Reps., contains
the main features of Joske’s first bill,
with additions by Barwick.
Labor-leader McKenna will move in
the Senate an amendment similar to
that moved in the Lower House by
Luchetti, for referring the bill to a
Select Committee.
However, the size of the vote in the
Reps, has convinced most members that
the bill will have a pretty easy passage
in the Senate.
Wowsers Win
[From Canberra]
The wowser element in the Common-
wealth Senate had a near t.k.o. against
Civil Aviation Minister Paltridge over
sale of liquor at airports.
Earlier this year, Paltridge introduced
legislation to provide liquor - facilities
at airports at hours when persons there
on legitimate business, such as waiting
for the arrival or departure of aircraft,
could justifiably be provided with a
drink
The wowsers, led by a group of South
Australians, said they would vote
against the legislation, and as they were
Government Senators, Paltridge had no
option but to withdraw the bill.
He returned recently with a rather
emasyulated edition of the legislation,
still providing for the sale of liquor, but
only within the hotel trading-hours in
the respective States. As a result, the
grog will be “on” at Sydney, Brisbane
and Hobart airports until 10 p.m.; at
Perth until 9 p.m. and in Melbourne
and Adelaide until 6 p.m.
Clear - thinking M.P.s realise that the
new provision, while allowing drinking
up till 10 p.m. in some cities, still leaves
Australia in the hillbilly class in com-
parison with major airports abroad.
They’re hoping that the wowsers who
forced their will on the Government
will be the first batch to get stranded
for an hour or two at Essendon after
6 p.m. on a hot, steamy summer’s night.
New Highway, Old Name
In bestowing on the road from Ballina
to Boggabilla the name “Bruxner High-
way” the N. S. Wales Government made
a departure from the usual practice of
naming State highways after explorers
and public men of past generations, and
instead made a handsome gesture, rather
out of the way in party politics. The
272-mile highway passes through Tenter-
field, which for 39 years has had as its
local M.L.A. Lieut.-Col. M. F. Bruxner,
former leader and present G.O.M. of the
N. S. Wales Country party.
Referring in the N. S. Wales Assembly
to the naming of this highway, Minister
for Local Government P. D. Hills
recalled that Bruxner had been Minister
for Local Government in 1927-30 and
Minister for Transport 1932-41. Hills
said that Bruxner during his term in
office had really been responsible for
classifying the principal roads of N. S.
Wales as State highways, and that this
farsighted move had been of great
benefit, since it had led to the planned
improvement of the principal main roads.
Bruxner, in expressing his thanks for
the tribute, said that although he had
been Minister when the main roads were
reclassified he couldn’t claim the credit
for the idea. That should go to the late
H. H. Newell, first Commissioner for
Main Roads. Newell and his staff and
their successors had performed a miracle
of roadbuilding.
The Country-party veteran said that
the Bruxner Highway ran right through
the country with which his family had
been associated for more than a century.
It passed within 150yds. of the place
where he himself was born and was the
first road he had ever travelled on.
A Wool Futures Market
The long and controversial task under-
taken by Clive Hall has borne fruit —an
Australian greasy-wool futures market is
to be established in Sydney.
Australian exchange-control authorities
have agreed to make funds available for
the settlement of futures transactions
involving non-residents and for appropri-
ate arbitrage operations between the
Australian and overseas markets.
Futures markets, either in greasy wool,
wool-tops or yarn already operate in
New York, London, Brussels, Roubaix
and Nagoya (Japan).
Sydney has been selected as the logi-
cal site for an Australian market, the
eastern States producing the bulk of
Merino wool which will be the only
commodity traded.
The exchange, which will operate
under the name of “Sydney Greasy Wool
Futures Exchange,” will be located at 16
O’Connell Street, Sydney.
Development Finance Corporation,
Ltd., has taken an active part in the
market’s formation, and through a
wholly-owned subsidiary (Australian De-
velopment Clearing House Pty.) will
provide clearing-house facilities and will
underwrite both the price and the delivery
of wool.
Futures operations are a form of price-
protection or insurance and are quite
distinct from wool-selling or wool-
marketing. On overseas experience, less
than 2 p.c. of futures contracts are
carried through to the point of delivery.
The nature and uses of a wool futures
market have been explained at length by
Clive Hall in Bulletin articles over the
past two years. The present move seems
to be a logical one in a country which is
the world’s greatest producer of wool.
And it will bring operations of the
market closer to the notice of the grower.
Gently Does It
[From “Collins Street”]
During the Melbourne “Peace” con-
ference I was to hear J. B. Priestley
at St. Kilda Town Hall.
When I arrived, the very large Town
Hall was half-filled and remained so
during the night, with Air-Marshal Sir
George Jones in the chair, flanked by
various congress personalities, chiefly
clerical. There was no sign of Priestley,
and after some delay the meeting opened
with the National Anthem, played fully,
and with a speech by the retired Air-
Marshal.
Sir George Jones’s address was
characteristically matter-of-fact. It dealt
with the strategy of the congress, as he
saw it.
The congress had been divided into
various conferences, he said, but at the
end an omnibus resolution which would
be unanimously approved by all the
conferences would be issued.
As Priestley hadn’t arrived, the clerics
took-over and addressed us, and about
an hour after the meeting had opened
it was announced from the platform
that Priestley had arrived, and we
were asked to stand and give him a
warm welcome. I stood up and clapped
with the others for the author of The
Good Companions, but after a minute
or two it became apparent Priestley
wasn’t there.
He arrived about a quarter of an
hour later, and the crowd rose again
with middle-class good manners and
clapped.
But J.B.P. was still withheld from us.
He sat at the table with sunken head
while three musical items and another
address of welcome were given and a
collection taken. Then Priestley took
over a microphone.
Priestley’s address was disappointing.
Some of his arguments had the familiar
ring of those from the amateur’s arm-
chair, and his more compelling points
had been reported in all editions of
the evening paper; he simply made
the same speech that he had given
earlier in the day to the trade-union
conference. He also spoke more briefly
than any of his supporters on the plat-
form, albeit there was a nice literary
flourish to some of his talk.
Going home, I realised that the
speakers had criticised between them
some of the important leadership in
Australian life, particularly the Federal
Cabinet and those churches which had
withheld their imprimatur from the
congress. The tone of these criticisms
was moderate and only occasionally
long-suffering ; but the overall impres-
sion for you, if you were impressionable,
was that those who stayed away and
did not support the congress did not
support peace, or, at any rate, really
care about it.
It seemed to me that this was a very
important success for the Communists,
achieved for them by those who are
avowed non-Communists.


BLACK VELVET
The second century of Guinness
On paper of aerial thinness
Is publicised to other climes
In reprints from the London “Times”;
Neither so heavy, nor so stout.
But fitter to be flown about.
The noblest Guinness, Lord Iveagh,
Writes on farming in his day ;
A lesser Guinness, mere Lord Moyne,
Speaks of both families, Stout and Coin *
The banker-Guinnesses could tell
What’s valued more than brewers sell.
Two knights write essays. One, Sir lan’s,
Speaks of the Guinnesses and Science ;
The other essay, by Sir Hugh,
Mentions the social good they do;
And professorial notes are made
On Guinness growth and foreign trade.
Then common people weigh in with
An essay on “The Guinness Myth,”
A note on “Guinness as Employer,” .
And how they brew their product for yer,
And how D. Sayers did her bit
In writing brilliant ads. for it.
In this, of course, she could propound
The best solution she had found . . .
The Guinnesses, they make it plain,
May some day soon afford champagne,
Or Benedictine, or Yquem,
But —Guinness has been Good for
Them !

A Dimboola (Vic.) man on holiday
in Canberra went along to sign

“5 G.R.”: On the late Captain
Wilkins and low flying (B. 11/11/ ’59):
Major R. G. Casey, D. 5.0., M.C., now
Minister for External Affairs, then a
staff-officer, flew constantly over our
lines at Pozieres in France at treetop-
level to make sure of our advanced
positions. Many men had let-off their
flares regardless of their significance. So
Dick Casey came himself on fact-finding
expeditions.
“Mugga Way”: Passengers boarding
some of the P. and O. ships in Australia
have appreciated a welcome at the foot
of the gangway from a smartly-dressed
woman with the company’s badge on
her frock. The innovation has obviously
been inspired by the airlines. So far,
only three of the line’s ships have hos-
tesses, one in first-class and one in
tourist, and the move is proving popular
with passengers. Unlike the Orient Com-
pany’s liaison-officers, those popular
gentlemen who arrange sports and other
entertainments, the hostesses’ duties are
mainly social. They bring congenial
groups together, make first-voyagers feel
less “at sea,” and respect the wishes
of those who want to be left alone.
Most passengers, both men and women,
"The boys at the lab. stumbled onto something
mighty big today”
enjoy being fussed-over by attractive and
competent young women, but one snag
in the job, it’s been found, is that elderly
dowagers are apt to seek the aid of the
hostess in searching for missing husbands,
not always an easy or rewarding task.

“Maitri”: If many people take-up the
slimming-diet advocated by a helpful
weekly I can see the basic wage soaring
again. There are the lunches, for
example: one day you’re recommended
to make the chief dish “a lean grill with
mushrooms”; another, the suggestion is
“a dozen oysters or a lobster salad.”
It looks as if the proletariat will just
have to stay corpulent on the good old
corned-beef or cheese-and-gherkin sand-
wich.

“Archaean”: Newcastle, N.S.W.,
where only 18 people turned-up to see
the Ballet (B. 11/11/ ’59), must
have slipped in the last 22 years. Asked
to accompany some speakers who were :
giving talks on Australian writers and
writing, I ventured the opinion that
going to Newcastle would be a waste
of time, and was told it was one of the
most culture-minded centres in Australia.
Our big, attentive audience there con-
firmed it. What’s happened since 1937?

“Tabba”: My 100th Bulletin par.
appeared on 28/10/’59 and I’ve passed
into my second century. Readers have
asked what “Tabba” means, thinking
it an abo. word. It’s the contraction of
Abbey Town, Cumberland, England,
known to the villagers
as “T’Abber” (The
Abbey). A hundred
pars, ago I thought
“Tabba” would look
neater.
“Vega”: A well-pre-
served Cobb and Co.
coach, drawn by five
skewbald horses and
carrying mail and a
replica of the first
gold - consignment,
rolled out of the civic
square at Gympie
(Q.) bound for Bris-
bane, and history
rolled back 92 years
to the discovery of
the goldfield which
saved the new State
from bankruptcy.
Two-and-a-half days
later, after surviving
two holdups by armed
bushrangers, and well
up to its original
schedule, the coach
drew-up at Victoria
Park, Brisbane, and
the “gold” was de-
livered to the Bank of
New South Wales and
philatelic mail-to the
G.P.O. Seventeen
horses were carried
ahead by float to provide changes
twice each day. One original staging-
house still exists, and some say that, as
the coach rumbled out of the distant
past and stopped briefly, they fancied
they heard a murmuring and rustling
in the air around the dilapidated struc-
ture. During the hour before the coach
reached its destination a helicopter,
symbolising the new age, carried mail
over the same route and landed along-
side its predecessor.


Wondered why all the shops in the

Our conversation is becoming adorned

we mimic the gestures and attitudes, and
find ourselves repeating the verses by
heart. My most serious worry is that
when I’m called upon to read the
minutes at our company’s annual meet-
ing, I shall bow,>take two steps forward,
and declaim:- “The King’s Breakfast —

was puzzled. “We used to use eighteen
inches of tape to tie each document,”
he explained, “but now we only use a

"Now, Miss Sooper, the first thing is to relax."
“Doynest”: There’s a dog-bites-man

Among all eligible for office, there are
probably few who didn’t start as office-
boys, junior clerks, or in some equally
inferior position. It would be news that
a former magnate had taken a job as
liftman ; and there should be a really
heart-stirring story in a migrant who
landed here 10 years ago with £50,000
and now hasn’t the price of a haircut.

pare views on redeveloping the centre
of the city. Miss Townsend, who hails
from Sydney, says that a town-planning
course tacked on to an architectural or
civil-engineering course is obsolete in the
U.S.; planners are considered important

with hips in plaster in Yaralla was
begging his mates to get one to replace
the one he had somehow lost. Being
a walking-patient I stopped every old
lady visiting the hospital and explained
the situation, but it was five visitors’
afternoons before an old mother handed
me six. “Thank God! Thank God!”
ejaculated my plastered friend. “I can
now get at the itchy spots. These slide
down under the plaster, and nothing else
can take their place.”

“Orian”: Twice a year, for our

my dress-shirt returned from the laundry

will receive gratis a beautiful budgerigar.
If I don’t wish to carry the bird home
in my hand, all I have to do is wait
until I’ve collected 100 cards —then a
birdcage will be thrown-in. I guess, to
collect the last few cards, it’ll have to
be a shroud instead of a shirt.

“Ex-Capt.”: The 2nd A.I.F. had its
war-babies, too (B. 4/11/’59). A 15-
year-old myself in the First Stoush with
the Light Horse, I arrived home in
1919 just after my 18th birthday. I
left the saddle at home when No. 2
Stoush started, and became a footslogger
at 38. Being really old, I failed to
notice the immaturity of the youngsters
in the battalion, but with the passing
of the years 1940-1945 I saw their
development from mere youngsters to
fine young men. During the excursion
of Fritz into the Tobruk salient my
battalion - commander ordered that 1
scout the perimeter and plot the depth
of the advance. I took Rosy with me,
he having volunteered. We contacted
the enemy, all right, and while lying


under very heavy machine-gun and
small-arms fire Rosy told me it was
his birthday. I inquired his age.
“Fifteen,” he said. The British tanks’
saved us, and so the boy lived on.
During the battles of the El Alamein
area, my neighbor’s son was killed. To
my letter, his father replied: “You prob-
ably wouldn’t understand our feelings.
He is our baby, and only 15 years of
age.” One of our Originals is a floor-
walker in a retail store. He lost his
arm in the Middle East. He is now 35.
Another Original, recently before the
police court, admitted to 36 —nineteen
years after his enlistment. Another,
killed off a motorbike this very month,
died at 36. As president of my
battalion association I know many of
these lads, who prefer to leave things
as they are. But they were grand boys
in the Army, and they’re grand men
now.

“Old Gippsland”: “The cellarman’s

DANCE-HALL INCIDENT
The clock said eight and so many people
There were dancing that hot summery
evening,
And Australian boys asked her to dance
at first,
And some she danced with were like her,
beginners,
And some experts . . . and she lost her
office-girl nervousness
And danced on and on and, finally way
addressed
By two Italians.
“Can I dance with you ?” one
stammered
Clumsily taking her unresisting hand,
Leading her across the floor and talking
haltingly,
" You’re so kind. There’s no one here
will dance with me,”
He said, “So kind,” and he was awkward
and small
As he danced —“So kind” —and his eyes
were timid and small
And he kept on repeating it and she
wanted to say,
“You poor thing. You poor lonely
foreign thing.”
And then the other Italian had her dance,
So they alternated and would sometimes
quarrel.
“I have her this dance . . . then you have
her next.”
“No, 1.. .” And dancing with her each
would say,
“You’re the only girl who likes me, the
only . . .
Can I take you out tomorrow night or
on Sunday ?
Can 1 take you out ? Please, please you
be my friend ?”
And no Australian boys now danced
with her
For these two were dancing with her all
the time,
And her office-girl heart grew alarmed
And wanted to get rid of them, but could
not,
Was too kind and too ingenuous to say,
“No.”
“You’re the only girl who likes me . . »
so kind . . .”
And she could never like them, but could
not say so.
“You should have a boyfriend,” one
cajoled her,
And finally—what she had never
dreamed—-
“Will you marry me ?
Nobody wants me but you,
So kind, so kind . . .” Like an awkward
child praying
In the dark chapel of love to the brutal
god
Who spurns the unbeautiful, the out-
cast . . .
“1 would be so good to you, such a good
husband . .
Begging for even some small portion of
the love
That other men had, with hands empty
and no offering
But the withered flowers of so many
rejected loves —
And she turned away and said nothing
and was pale.
It was quite impossible and silly,
The office-girl thought, they were so
different, so .. .
The clock said eleven and now she refused
to dance
And collected her briefcase and walked
in full view
Across the dance-hall, not daring to look
back,
With firm, precise steps, and caught a
tram,
And resolved never to go dancing there
again.

CROCODILE
By
ALEXANDER
GRAY
There was no good reason
why Darrow should
want to go to Cook-
town, unless a yen just
to see a place is a good reason.
For those who have money,
there are boats and planes that
will drop you off in Cooktown,
but those without money must
walk. There is no road to
stand on the side of and wave
your thumb, and no railroad-
track with friendly freights to
beckon the tourist without
funds.
So you must walk —and
swim. There are seven rivers
to cross, which explains why
there is no road or rail; there
are not enough people in
Cooktown to warrant the
expense. And apart from the
seven bridges needed, most of
the hundred-odd miles is
mountainous and jungle-
covered.
Darrow had no money. A
week previously he had had
enough for a luxury trip
around the world. Not that
he had ever contemplated such
a way of running through the
money that represented half a
year’s back-breaking toil,
slashing away in the sugar-
fields for 12 hours and some-
times more till the 10 tons of
cane which was the daily mark
he had set himself had fallen
to his knife ; but neither had
he contemplated running
through the money in a 19-hour
non-stop card-game.
What he had contemplated,
ana hardly ever stopped con-
templating during his six
months with the cane-knife,
was a quart of beer for every
ton of cane he had cut, to
be consumed no less than 2000
miles from where sugarcane
would grow.
The day and night in the
card-game had taken the place
of his six months’ holiday in
the south, and now without
the price of a beer in his
pocket, the south and the cities
had lost their appeal, and he
remembered his yen to see
Cooktown.
He would have been well-
advised to control it until such
time as he had the money for
the fare, for the seven rivers
between him and Cooktown
were the habitat of perhaps the
largest and man - eatingest
crocodiles in existence.
wasn’t the man to
control anything, so he
started walking.
He soon discovered that he
was no bushman. He spent
whole days travelling in
near-perfect circles, blunder-
ing one way and another,
tumbling down hillsides, get-
ting hopelessly entangled in
jungle creeping-vines, and
finally convinced himself that
his bump of direction was non-
existent.
Also, he lost his rifle.
After three days of this he
found himself on a faint track
that he was just able to follow,
and it brought him to the first
river, or the first crossing,
since all seven crossings were
of the same river, which lay
like a huge semi-coiled snake
obstructing his course.
He made the crossing and
five others without even seeing
a crocodile, although the
thought of them was always
with him. He knew they were
there, but as he hadn’t seen
them he had only his imagina-
tion to cope with.
Each time he had made a
crossing the river had been a
little wider, a little deeper and
a little saltier. He had been
able to wade across the
30yd. to 50yd. widths of the
first four crossings. At the
fifth he had had to swim a
little, and at the sixth, where
it had been about 80yds. across,
he had had to swim a good
half of the way.
Just after sundown on the
sixth day he came to the
seventh crossing.
Although the river had been
changing in appearance from
crossing to crossing as it neared
the sea, Darrow was dismayed
to find how much this seventh
crossing differed from the
others. Only a mile from the
mouth, now, and at least
250yds. across; its depth he
could only guess, but he was
sure it was all beyond wading.
And more worrying to him
than its width and depth was
its color; it had lost its crystal
clarity and now was a muddy-
green slime.
He would have liked to have
got over and had all the river
business done-with before he
made camp. It was not. yet,
dark, but the light was not
good enough for him to feel
sure that the way was clear,
although he knew that even
at high-noon he could never be
really sure. Apart from the
width, depth and murk of it,
a bend about 100yds. up-
stream would conceal anything
that might be beyond it, so
that a crocodile could come
from around it and have him
long before he could reach the
opposite bank ; or one of them
could be out of the water
altogether and follow him in.
Still, he reckoned he would
have a better chance in good
daylight. He made himself a
camp on an open patch of
ground about 100yds. back
from the river.
He cooked and ate his
supper, arranged his bedding,
and built-up a good fire, col-
lecting enough wood to keep
it going at a blaze all night.
Then he got under his blanket,
thought awhile about the
day’s travel, then about
tomorrow’s, and dropped off
to sleep.
He had not been asleep more
than 20 minutes when he
was awakened by the sounds of
something moving through the
jungle up from the river.
He knew immediately what
it was, but hoped desperately
that he was wrong. Scrambling
to his feet he grabbed a piece
of firewood. Holding it aloft
he waited with trembling
limbs and pounding heart, and
would have given 20 years of
his life to hear the sounds
receding.
But they came closer, and
finally there burst into the
open space of his camp, jointly
lit by the gibbous moon and

POLITICAL POINTS
Country-party veteran Mick Bruxner
copped two bouquets from his Labor
opponents last week. First they named
a State highway after him. Then, in
replying to a question about the eligi-
bility of Australians for the post of
Governor-General, Premier Heffron
coupled him with Menzies and Evatt as
persons he could name offhand who
would make admirable G.-G.s. Of course,
Heffron has no say in the choice of
occupants of Yarralumla, but if he stays
in office long enough he’ll be called on
to submit names for the State guber-
natorial post.

For years Ernie O’Dea, secretary of
the Shop Assistants’ Union, has been
able to dictate shopping-hours policy to
the N. S. Wales Labor Government, and
therefore to the people of New South
Wales. He has successfully withstood
all attempts by metropolitan shop-
keepers to bring back Friday-night
shopping—though he did offer to swap
it for Saturday-morning closing. It
would be rather ironic if he were finally
routed on this issue by little Queanbeyan,
but it’s quite on the cards.
Defiance of the law by Queanbeyan
shopkeepers—on two successive Friday
nights a majority of shops have stayed
open till 9 p.m. instead of 5..30 p.m. —
is not mere perverseness. With shops
in Canberra, only seven miles away,
legally open till 9 p.m. the Queanbeyan
business - people feel it is a matter of
economic necessity. And the people of
the town seem to be heartily in accord
with them.
The problem for O’Dea —and for
Maloney and Heffron —is that what
Queanbeyan is doing now Cooma,
Gundagai or Goulburn may do next
week, and Hay, Hell and Booligal the
week after. Before they know where
they are even Sydney may follow suit.

Garfield Barwick will have cause to
look back on the Divorce Bill as a
turning-point in his career. Any doubts
about his capacity as a'Parliamentarian
disappeared with his handling of the
contentious measure. He showed himself
not only strong and fearless but a capable
tactician. From now on he must definitely
be in the betting for the top job.

This will be Hungary week at U.N.
if the Assembly’s steering-committee
decides that the sacred subject may be
debated. Russia has threatened to renew
the cold war if it is, and has already
accused America of “undermining the
spirit of co-operation” by supporting the
initiators of the debate. The Russian
behavior in U.N. is in tough contrast to
the suavity of Khrushchev —when he is
not counting his H-bombs and meditat-
ing his power to destroy the world. It
seems now to be making a dead set at
Hammarskjold and intent on driving
him out as it did his predecessor Trygve
Lie. He has offended not only by going
to Laos but by taking thither a Finn who
is persona non grata in Moscow.

Alderman Jensen, even with his cricket-
eleven of candidates in every ward, is
being given a real run by Civic Reform
in the City Council elections. His
trouble is that high land-taxes and rates
have made the city impossible for the
slum-landlord. And the council substi-
tute for slums—large barrack-buildings
that look like Long Bay without the wall
—don’t hold enough voters. The day
seems in sight when the city will revert
to businessman government.

From a field of five Tom Cahill won
the Labor nomination for his late
father’s seat, Cook’s River, fairly com-
fortably—which means he is almost
certain to win the seat. The Liberal party
intends to contest the by-election fixed
for December 12, but as the Labor
majority at recent elections has been very
high their candidate starts a long way
behind scratch.

Somebody should compile a Roll of
the Disillusioned, enbalming the names
of the great ones of politics and science
in Australia who have been members
of the Communist party or have fol-
lowed the Communist line and recanted.
It could begin with the new Premier
of N. S. Wales who was once official
tutor in public-speaking to the Com-
rades and could end (for the time being)
with the former Senator Morrow of Tas-
mania, who displayed acquired know-
ledge in exposing the techniques of the
“peace” conference and its Commu-
nist background.
BULL IN A CHINA SHOP


After Duthie, Labor M.H.R. for
Wilmot (Tas.), had remarked that the
contentious five-year clause in the
Divorce Bill was similar to a provision
operating in Tasmania, Luchetti, Labor
M.H.R. for Macquarie (N.S.W.), said it
would be a retrograde step if the rest
of Australia were to follow Tasmania
in that respect. He said it seemed to
be a case of “Barwick, Tasmania and
Reno against the world.” When the
clause was put to the vote 70 members
lined-up with Barwick, Tasmania and
Reno ; 25 with the world.

Some gasps of astonishment were
heard in the Queensland Assembly when
A.L.P.-leader Duggan paid a compli-
ment to Q.L.P.-leader Gair. After em-
phasising that he didn’t often pay
tribute to Gair, Duggan said that the
former Premier had been not unmindful
of the need for accelerated work in the
education field. Speaking later, Gair
theorised that the tribute might be a
warning that something of immense im-
portance was about to happen, wondered
aloud whether Duggan had accepted an
invitation to join “a true Labor party.”
Outside the chamber, Duggan said Gair’s
construction of his remarks was only
wishful thinking.

The repercussions of the new postal
charges seem to be almost endless.
Latest to complain were Queensland
school - children taking bookkeeping
as a subject in the Junior Public
examination. Their problem: which
postal rates should they use in answering
the questions—new or old? The ruling
from the University, which set the paper,
was: old rates, those in operation before
October 1. That could make those
exam.-candidates just about the only
people -in Australia happy about postage.

Much to the pleasure of Treasurer
Bolte, not to mention the Tramways
Board, Melbourne trams lost a mere
£136,000 last financial year compared
with a real clanger of £1,230,000 the
previous year. Because of wage-rises,
this year's deficit is expected to be up
again—£J million is the estimate. Last
year, takings were 6s. 6d. a mile and
expenses 6s. 7d. There are now so few
trams at off-peak periods in Melbourne
that the board could be suspected of
pausing to make sure 6s. 6d. a mile is
waiting before shunting one down the
route.

“C.S.”: It wasn't to be expected Mel-
bourne would allow Sydney or its police
to get all the spotlight with the man they
could not sight, and, sure enough,
Russell Street C. 1.8. came up with two
Norman Howards. One of these was
drowned, positively identified by his last
employer and buried with his wife at
Ballarat; the other, who turned-up in
some alarm to collect his war-pension,
was a highly material ghost indeed, who
explained that he hadn’t read the hulla-
baloo in the papers about him when
letters from him were received by people
after his —er—death, and that the bundle
of his clothing, found on a wharf, had
been stolen from him. The Melbourne
Coroner was sufficiently impressed to
order an exhumation, and the live
Norman Howard has certainly impressed
Repat. with his liveliness: it paid him
his war-pension.

Not many turned-up for the opening

declining, as they are in Melbourne.
McNolty, A.L.P. Victorian president,
complained the trade-union movement
was becoming too respectable, with
almost everybody trying to own a house,

New South Wales Labor caucus will
this week discuss a motion proposed by
Seiffert, M.L.A. for Monaro, to return
to the Assembly the portfolios of
Attorney-General and Justice (now held
by Downing, M.L.C.) and Labor and
Industry (held by J. J. Maloney, M.L.C.).
The anomaly of retaining these port-
folios in the Council when that body
is (in theory, at any rate) marked for
early extinction is perhaps explained
by the rumor that the Government pro-
poses, in the event of the Council being
abolished, to “compensate” the two
Ministers by giving them lump-sum
payments equivalent to their salaries for
the unexpired portion of the life of the
current Parliament.
This is of very doubtful legality, but
might very well be true. Earlier, there
was a story that all M.L.C.s would be
“compensated” for the loss of their ex-
pense-allowance—a disgraceful sugges-
tion if ever there was one.

Atomic-power expert Lord Coleraine
said in Queensland that Australia’s

will be the world’s largest, “unless the
Russians have one we don’t know

eventually be cheaper than coal-produced
electricity, but not in the teething-
stations.

“Collins Street”: Melbourne Equity
Trustees have wiped the slate clean of

Jimmy Richardson was 87 when he

Richardson’s Family Hotel, on the n.-e.

From G. P. James (Tully, N.Q.):—
J. A. J. Hunter (B. 21/10/’59) is entitled to
his opinion, but it will cut little ice in the
area of North Queensland controlled by the
Lib'.-C.P. Co-ordinating Committee.
Before the formation of this committee the
Federal electorate of Herbert was an A.L.F.
blue-ribbon seat, arid its five State electorates
were divided between three A.L.P., one North
Queensland Labor and one Independent. in
a campaign conducted with intelligence and
enthusiasm the Federal seat was won and
plans are in hand for next year s State electio .
It is clear that 95 per cent of the voters
who support the Menzies and Ntcklin Govern-
ments don’t give two hoots whether the antt-
Socialist candidate flies the Liberal- or Country
party colors. Are these people to be deprived
of their right to representation because of the
intolerance of the other five per •
Apparently Mr. Hunter would rather see a
seat held by the A.L.P. _ than by a
“co-ordinated” candidate. It is precisely this
dog-in-the-manger attitude that the committee
was designed to combat. .

ITEMS
Monash University Council is choosing
young men for the new seat. Dr. Ronald
Brown, first professor to be appointed,
is 32 ; and Francis Johnson, who will
be Registrar, a post usually reserved for
quite mature university men, is 41.
Dr. Brown, Reader in Theoretical
Chemistry at Melbourne Uni., becomes
foundation-Professor of Chemistry. A
Wesley lad, he graduated with first-class
honors at Melbourne Uni. and obtained
a Master of Science degree before he
went to London and won a Doctorate
of Philosophy at King’s College. He
has published 60 scientific papers, has
a worldwide reputation. His aim at the
new university will be to devise a com-
pletely modern course.
Frank Johnson, Oxford M.A., became
an inspector of taxes in Britain, migrated
to Adelaide to become secretary of the
University Appointments Board, and
later of the faculty of medicine, and five
years ago became assistant Registrar in
W.A., where, as secretary of the Medical
School Appeal Committee, he helped to
raise £560,000 to establish a W.A.

Clement Hosking on the new G.-G.:
When, nearly a quarter of a century ago, 1
was leaving Australia to do some research
in folksong and folklore in the Outer Hebrides,
Lord Wakehurst, then Governor of N. S.
Wales, gave me letters of introduction to people
who might prove of assistance. One letter
was to W. S. Morison, Minister for
Agriculture and Fisheries. 1 never managed
to meet Mr. Morison —we were never in
Scotland at the same time —but I still treasure
charming letters from the man who, as -Lord
Dunrossil, has just been appointed Governor-
General. On North Uist I visited his old home and
met members of his family, together with many
of his friends on that remote isle. Later, on
the mainland, I met more of his close acquaint-
ances, and I found in every case that “Willie”
Morison's name was synonymous with personal
integrity. His appointment will give satisfaction
to Scots in this country and to those of
Scottish descent; especially, no doubt, to those
of Highland blood and, above all, to that
rapidly-diminishing hard core the Gaelic-
speakers. Lord Dunrossil is bilingual; he
speaks Gaelic as fluently as English, has a
profound knowledge of Gaelic literature and
song and is a capable practitioner on the
bagpipes. His knowledge of Gaelic music
embraces its more esoteric forms (and the
crown of Celtic musical expression)—the oran
mor and the pibroch. Australians will like
their new G.-G., who, though a politician for
the greater portion of his life, is a man without
guile, interesting, honest, straightforward; in
the tradition of Lord Gowrie and Sir William
Slim.

Here sketched, the Rev. George
William Mann, latest commissioned
Australian Inland Mission padre, called
at The Bulletin a few hours
before setting off to initiate the
first of the A.l.M.’s inland - patrols
in N.S.W. His patrol renamed
the Sturt Patrol, though there was
formerly one of that name in South
Australia —will cover the area opened-up
by Sturt from 1827 onwards in the
N.S.W. Far West: the Padre will operate
on a line west o’ Bourke, Cobar and
Hillston, crossing the border into S.A.,
where the A.I.M. has a hospital at
Radium Hill. His territory—2oo,ooo
square-miles of it—runs from the Vic-
torian border north to Queensland ; he
will be based on Sydney, with a supply-
base at Ivanhoe, but for the first year
his home will be a station-wagon
STURT PATROL
equipped with transceiver-radio to keep
him in touch with the Royal Flying
Doctor base at Broken Hill. As well as
doing his normal A.I.M. job, he’s out
to make his patrol an actual link with
dispersed families who are connected
with the School of the Air.
Born at Ballarat (Vic.), but raised on
a farm-property on Queensland’s Darling
Downs, where his family were among
the pioneer-settlers, the Padre is an
experienced bushsman, and he has
another useful bit of personal equip-
ment as well —having worked for seven
years in the radio-trade, he’s a trained
radio-technician.
He studied for the Church through the
Home Mission Department, then went
to Emmanuel College Theological Hall
in Brisbane. After he was ordained his
first post was at Booval (Q.), then fof
nine years he was minister at Casino
(N.S.W.).

started as a messenger in the P.M.G.
Department. He rose steadily to In-
spector of Central Administration in
1921 and Chief Inspector of Personnel
in 1934 —a post interrupted by war,
during and after which he held several
important positions until 1947, when he
was appointed Deputy Director-General
of Posts and Telegraphs, to become
Director-General two years later. He
held the top job until his retirement in
1958.

Munro, chief scientist at the Australian
Atomic Energy Commission since 1955.
Dr. S. T. Butler, who’s been Reader in
Physics at the Uni. since 1954, becomes
Professor of Physics (theoretical).
Watson-Munro graduated as Master
of Science with first-class honors in
physics at the University of New
Zealand and joined the D.S.I.R in 1935,
working on radar-research. After ex-
perience in the U.S.A., N.Z. and Canada,
he became principal scientific officer at


Harwell (Eng.) Atomic Energy Research
Establishment in 1946 and was in charge
of the team responsible for Britain’s
first atomic-pile. He has directed the
building of the nuclear reactor and
laboratories at Lucas Heights (N.S.W.).
Dr. Butler, a Master of Science at
Adelaide University, gained his Ph.D.
at Birmingham, where he held an Aus-
tralian National University scholarship
in 1949-52. He was research-associate
at Cornell University (U.S.A.) and a
senior research-fellow at the Australian
National Uni. before taking his Sydney

“Splint”: Old Diggers certainly fade
away—out of their jobs; though a
surprising number still battle for the
crust. A recent one to join the retired
is A. R. McConchie—“young Ray
McConk,” as old Ist Div. Sigs. will
recall him. He gives it away after 48 years
with Victoria’s Rivers and Water Supply Com-
mission. When he lately pulled-out he was
executive engineer in charge of the commis-
sion’s main reservoirs; but he has a more
out-of-the-way memory than anything of that
sort to keep him company. He is one of a
notable boatload that got ashore at Anzac
on the day of the Landing. A shrap.-sheli
burst at the right height fair in their course,
but about 20yds. ahead, and not one of them
was hit. It could well have got the lot of
them, and the chief ones in that boatload
were the First Divisional General Staff for
the Landing: General Bridges, Colonel C. B.
White, Colonel Glasfurd, Major Thomas
Blarney and Major Mackworth, Director of
Army Signals. When Melbourne “Age”
reported the “McConk’s” retirement he was
given as the sole survivor, bringing a reminder
from J. M. Cunningham, of the Yarraside
city’s Brighton, that he, also, is well and
truly on deck. He and Ray McConchie are
the only two. Some, at least, of the old
Div. Sigs., who will remember Ray as a
rosy-cheeked boy throughout his 1914-to-1919
war-days, may also recall a remarkable private
blue on Gallip. in which Cunny figured but
Ray didn’t. Cunny hailed from South Africa
and spoke Afrikaans, and it was a word or two
he spoke in that lingo to a Boer War and
Boxer Rebellion veteran with the old mob
which started the blue. Cunny had the advan-
tage of not carrying the pot-belly which the
other bloke found a bit of a handicap; but,
anyway, it was a good blue while it lasted.

Aubrey Duncan Mackenzie retires
from the chairmanship of Melbourne
Harbor Trust a few weeks hence after
his long term of nearly 20 years in that
post. Though he’s had his critics,
especially among the heads of some
other Government departments, it’s
admitted by all hands that he has main-
tained the Port of Melbourne’s prestige.
His interest in ships ranges down to
small boats, stimulated when his father
gave him a motor-boat for passing what
is now known as the Intermediate, and
he has been a keen yachtsman, boat-
builder and commodore of Sandringham
Yacht Club. Formerly chief engineer
of public works and engineer-in-charge
of ports and harbors before going on
to the Country Roads Board, he has to
his credit, as public-works jobs, such
Melbourne showplaces as the King’s
Domain, the Yarra Boulevard and the
Shrine lawns.

In Brisbane, Owen Hayes, a third-generation
member of one of the city’s oldest hotel-
pioneering families. His grandfather owned
the original Criterion Hotel, on the site of the
present Embassy. His father built the

Owen himself took it over and ran it until
he retired in 1936.
In Melbourne, Henry James Gordon,
managing-director of R. H. Gordon and Co.,

Joseph Coady, parish-priest of Merewether
since 1932. In his youth a fine boxer, he was
mentor and lifelong friend of Les Darcy.
In Melbourne, Lieut.-Colonel Hector Bastin,
M.C., who was commissioned at the Landing,
became adjutant to “Pompey” Elliott, of the
old 7th Battalion, and had his arm shattered
and won his Military Cross at Lone Pine.
Later, as a cavalry-officer in India, Bastin again
proved the perfect adjutant. A natural choice
for a command in War 11, he took the 9th
Aust. Cav. Regt. to the Middle East.

founder of the Bodenwieser Ballet Company.
She was for many years Professor of Dance

THE PAINTED DRAGON
(From “In My Land Now”)
In my land now
the painted dragon basks in the red
sand
dressed in his mating clothes, ochre and
blue.
And there the skink lives in the rotted
stump,
banded and like the centipede he meets
daily at feasting in the broken wood,
rich with creamy termites where it lies
turning to earth again. Deep in the rocks
where no man comes, the brown snake
has her home.
Sinuous and beautiful she is,
and unafraid, safe in the broken clutter
of a cave where lies a fine chert adze-
forgotten years ago by some old man
who came that way and shaped a mulga
spear
for pastime on the hunting camp. But
now
the emus seldom go to water there,
even when quandongs brighten the rich
sand.
Only the possum listens still at night
to all the weird sounds in the trees and
rocks ~
whose names have been forgotten. From
his height
the eagle swings upon his beat, and dark
wing-shadows blot the sunlight out and
freeze
the gecko on his lichened rock, and make
a pool of silence in that murmurous
place.

ABORIGINALITIES
TXot on the scent, with their noses to
the ground, eight foxhounds failed
to see the 30ft. shaft of a disused mine
in front of them, and down they went
one by one. They stayed there for four
days, while members of the Tredegars
Farmers’ Hunt (Q.) searched high and
low for their vanished pack. Finally the
searchers, combing undergrowth in a
forestry plantation, heard whimpering.
The hounds were raised to the surface
by rope, and there was nothing wrong
with them that a good feed couldn’t
cure. —“S. F.”

“J.J.A.”: A store in a countrv town
opened a branch in the next town, 14
miles away. Several times a day the
storekeeper’s wife hops in the car and
rockets over to see how things are
going. She does the trip in record time,
but the rumor getting around that she
goes over to serve each customer is with-
out foundation.

“Peter B.”: A large car went through
our town, which straddles the Hume
Highway, at about 60 m.p.h. The traffic-
cop gave chase, but after four miles
hadn’t got close enough to get the car-
number, and gave the game away. I
taxed him with it later, and he told me
he would have had to exceed 100 m.p.h.
to catch the lunatic —his cycle could
have done it, but on that road such a
speed would be suicide. The speedster
would have brought a £5 fine, and the
constable reckoned his life was worth
more than that.
TIMOR ROCK—eight miles from Coonabarabran in the
Warrumbungle Mountains (N.S.W.). The famous “balancing
rock" mentioned in “Duke” Tritton’s “TIME MEANS
TUCKER” was said to have been blown over in a storm
in 1927; but some said the storm was gelignite. The small
figure, superimposed to scale (on Tritton’s estimate), stands
on a rock ledge where Tritton once stood. “TIME MEANS
TUCKER” is now available from The Bulletin in book-
form. A postal order-form will be found elsewhere in
this issue.

“Maitri”: A 1000-acre property
owned by friends of ours at Singleton
(N.S.W.) was surrounded on three sides
by the Hunter River, it being roughly
horseshoe-shaped. They’d been there for
23 years when they decided to sell. A
number of floods that had come along
during their occupancy seemed to have
increased the size
of the estate: a
tree, for instance,
under which (when
they first went
there) they used to
shelter from the sun
while fishing in the
river, now stood in
the middle of a pad-
dock. Sure enough,
a re-survey disclosed
that no fewer than
98 acres had been
added during that
time by silting-up.

“Unk White’s” de-

people have learned,
or are learning, that
underground-water supplies are seldom
inexhaustible. The U.S. drew heavily on
them in some cattle-raising areas, and
now many of the big ranches are turn-
ing seasonal floodwaters into the wells
and bores in the hope of replenishing
underground supplies which suddenly
ended. Los Angeles obtained a big pro-
portion of its water-supply from bores.
Not long ago the water in them became
salt —fresh water, stored underground

through the ages, had all been drawn

same happened in New York. The
recent recpord dry-spell in South Aus-
tralia has caused many private, shallow-
depth wells and bores to give-out; there
is, however, little likelihood of this hap-
pening with the deeper bores which sup-
ply Adelaide with some of its water in
a drought-year. Whenever the reservoirs
in the nearby hills start to overflow in
a season of heavy rainfall, water from
their mains is put down those bores to
recharge the aquifers, and be available
when drought comes again.

graziers who previously had to get their

“Elbow": Percy Leason’s death in the
U.S. recalls that the man who created
the well-known Wiregrass cartoons was
born at Kaniva, a far-west township in
Victoria. What farmers endured on the
western plains several decades ago was
probably the source of many a Wire-
grass cartoon. Some months back, visit-
ing the now-prosperous and modern
town of Kaniva, I came across a num-
ber of the citizenry perched on the front-
step of one ol the most popular build-
ings. They were communing with each
other through the heat-haze —a thirsty
task. “Reminds me of one of Leason’s
cartoons,” I said to an acquaintance
among them. “If only that step
were a post-and-rail fence . . . Only
thing missing is the flies where
have the flies gone?” They grinned.
Mac grunted and thumbed towards his
lean mate. “Ask Bill,” he said
succinctly ; “he drinks with ’em.”

“Margaret”: Not all governesses at
earlier country homesteads had such
a thin time, “J.W.” (B. 2/ 9 / ’59). Ours
did no housework beyond making her
own bed, had her clothes washed by
the laundress ‘and her shoes cleaned by
the cowboy. A horse was brought saddled
to the garden-gate when required ; she
was included in all social activities ; and
a large male staff provided her with
ample tennis-partners and in due course
a husband. A few years later I found
her teaching again, plus all the duties
perlormed by “Duke’s Daughter” (B.
12/8/’59) and a few more. She, too,
used Mrs. Potts’ irons (not “Granny”
Potts, and they’re not flatirons, but the
deep kind with detachable wooden
handle), and wistfully recalled that, in
oui house, she d been paid £1 a week,
all to herself. But she didn't throw
down her apron and leave this job she
was now in ; she was married to it, and
the pupils were her own children.

Norque ’: The something-in-a-
matchbox used as a threat by swaggies
to cockier reluctant to give a handout
was remembered by Bill, a cobber in the
Bth Divvy. Reduced to a wardrobe of
G-string and monkey-boots, and on a
tight diet of rice, we marched daily with
about 100 others from our quarters at
the Ford factory on Bukit Timah Road
to a site on a neighboring ridge-crest
overlooking the Straits of Johore and
Singapore. The spot was chosen for the
erection of a memorial to the Nips who
died in the advance from Thailand to the
“Naked Island,” and Bill’s matchbox
contained termites, which he released
every day to dine on the rising structure.

“Rehab”: The manager of the cattle-
station to which I was going introduced
me as the new bookkeeper to the two
telegraph-linesmen in the bar of a
Northern Territory hotel, whereupon one
of them grunted: “Huh —another bloody
death-adder!” The manager explained
that the term was tagged to station-
bookkeepers in the N.T. because they
were generally “such bad - tempered
cows.” Then it came out that the lines-
men sought accommodation at the
station. In the manager’s absence the
retiring bookkeeper told them there was
no room at the homestead ; the best he
could offer was a then-vacant hut down
on the creek. It wasn’t till later that they
found out it was the abo. stockmen’s
quarters.

“Mackville”: In view of the fact that
“roselia” has become the accepted spell-
ing for what was originally “Rose-
Hiller,” is the name of that member
of the parrot family the quarrion—
which was first noted in one of the early
N.S.W. quarries a corruption of
“quarry-hen”?

/“\ne of the two men who found Aus-
tralia's biggest gold-nugget seems to
be the forgotten man of our goldmining
era. Whereas his partner, the more
businesslike and obtrusive Holtermann,
is commemorated by a street in Crow’s
Nest (Sydney) and in other ways, little
is left to mark Hugo Louis Beyer’s
service to the community. There is not
even a photograph of him to be found.
Both men were German: Holtermann
born in Hamburg, Beyers in Posen.
After the discovery, on October 19, 1872,
that made them rich beyond the dreams
of any digger, Holtermann became
manager of a mining-company on the
field, finally leaving for the city to enter
business.
Beyers remained in Hill End, serving
as a borough-councillor, finally as
Mayor, and in other ways. He spent
much of his riches on the township itself
and in helping down-and-out diggers. He
was twice elected to the N.S.W. Parlia-
ment, representing in turn the Goldfields
West Division, and Mudgee. When he
finally left Hill End no public acknow-
ledgment of his work there was made,
and his death some years later in Sydney,
where he struck financial difficulties,
passed almost unnoticed. The only thing
that reminds Hill End of its benefactor
and good citizen is the tree-lined Beyers
Avenue, and even that is now a more-
or-less deserted and out-of-condition
thoroughfare.

French Economic Recovery
Speaking at a Constitutional
Association of N.S.W.
luncheon at the Trocadero on
Nov. 16, 1959, M. Pierre
Menard, Commercial Attache
at the French Embassy,
described France’s economic
recovery.
He pointed out that, since the
end of the last war, the French
economy had undergone a
tremendous transformation.
Taking 1938 as base-year (100),
the index of industrial produc-
tion had grown to 235, he said,
This had happened without
appreciable increases in the
labor-force, and was achieved
through a sustained high rate
of investment and a very rapid
improvement in the efficiency
of the work-force.
The main difficulty which
plagued successive Govern-
ments of the Fourth Republic
was a powerful inflationary
trend on the consumer-goods
market.
Extensive deficit-financing
by former administrations
served to accentuate inflation.
The protracted war in Indo-
China and the continuing
struggle in Algeria, accom-
panied by Algerian nationalist
terrorism in metropolitan
France, have been a severe
strain on the French economy,
France, according to M.
Menard, paid out more on
tbese wars than !t received in
under the Marshall Plan.
By 1957-58 France was in
the throes of a major economic
and political crisis. Continuing
price - rises, stimulated by
Budget - deficits and high
wa B es in ]abor - hungry
industry, had disastrous effects
on . the balance-of-payments,
Chief symptoms were:
1. Domestic market was too
buoyant and there was no
incentive to export;
2. Prices were becoming
less and less competitive ;
3. Lack of confidence in the
currency caused a flight from
the franc,
Following the political crisis
in May, 1958, when France
virtually hovered on the brink
of civil war, sweeping consti-
tutional reforms were made
and the executive’s powers
drastically widened, at the
expense of the once almost all-
powerful National Assembly,
President de Gaulle’s new
Government directed its econo-
mic effort to reducing Govern-
ment spending and abandon-
ing the traditional trade-policy,
taking “a certain number of
steps towards the dismantling
of our traditional protectionism
and more liberalism.”
The franc was devalued by
p.c., and was made con-
vertible for non-residents,
Restrictions on purchases of
industrial raw-materials were
lifted, and French firms were
allowed to buy from cheaper
suppliers.
About 90 p.c. of French
trade within the loose 18-
country E.E.C.E. zone (of which
"I'm dead scared my kids'll become juvenile delinquents
with no father to keep 'em on the right track."
the U.K. is a member) was
freed.
Another important step was
to end most of the extensive
subsidies paid to domestic
producers, especially in agri-
culture. Net result was a drop
in the real purchasing-power of
the population and a rise in
export - trade, which now
averages £AI6O million a
month.
The inflow of foreign capital
into France amounted to 1600-
million dollars in the firsf six
months of 1959.
Industrial production showed
a slower rate of growth, but
there was no significant un-
employment. France is still
producing about a million cars
a year. Industrial output is
expected to rise by 5 p.c. to
10 p.c. during 1960, as com-
pared with the current year.
Speaking to The Bulletin
after his address, M. Menard
said that 90 p.c. of French
purchases from Australia were
wool. The value of Australian
exports to France fluctuated
with wool-prices, and was
about £45 million in 1958-59
(£9O million in 1957-58).
Although French exports to
Australia totalled only about
£lO million a year, there was
no question of France trying
to reduce its purchases in Aus-
tralia to establish a trade-
balance. Wool-purchases could
be stepped-up, if anything.
No doubt President ds
Gaulle’s administration showed
courage and determination in
adopting unpopular measures
to rectify the economic situa-
tion which was getting out-of-
hand. The attack on powerful
vested interests by cutting-
away the subsidies appears to
have been successful. The
French economy now has a
more balanced growth, without
having to support large sections
of inefficient producers in addi-
tion to the huge non-working

and assist with reservations, accommoda-

population of elderly people
and growing-up children. The
rise in birthrate has been
quite remarkable, and in a few
years the “early-starters” of the
post-war generation will join
the labor-force.
All this should help France
to achieve a greater weight in
world affairs, which has been
the object of desperate efforts
for many years. The recent, and
coming, high-level contacts
between the U.K. and French
Governments are another
pointer in that direction.
Angus and* Robertson
HThe financial career of Angus
and Robertson, Ltd., Aus-
tralia’s largest book-publishing
house, reads something like a
mystery thriller. Nobody out-
side knows what the real score
is even at this stage.
The profits of Halstead Press
Pty., Ltd., have not been
taken into the parent’s books
for many years, and all invest-
ments, including this subsidiary,
have a book-value of only
£36,156, even though this
covers all the printing and
bookbinding plant owned by
the A. and R. organisation.
Further, these subsidiaries
have been able to advance the
parent co. £99,580 (June 30,
1959) to help it carry stocks
and to finance new freeholds
and buildings.
Angus and Robertson trades
as a bookseller itself in Sydney,
Melbourne and London, and
out of these earnings alone it
has paid a 15 p.c. dividend
since 1946, and not less than
12| p.c. for the preceding 10
years.
Its chief repository for
ploughed-back, undisclosed
profits has obviously been
Halstead Press Pty., Ltd.,
although on its own account,
by way of property-reserves,
share-premiums and undistri-
buted profits it had 78s. lOd. in
visible net tangible backing for
every £1 of ord. share capital
at the 1958-59 balance.
A bonus-issue of 65,000 £1
ords., one for three, is now
being made, to be followed by
a similar issue for cash (one
for four) at a premium of 15s.
The bonus-issue will be more
than covered by the £96,249
already in share-premiums
reserve, if the board chooses
to finance it that way.
The 1958-59 profit was dis-
closed at £43,931 after writing-
off the parent’s £7306 of depre-
ciation and providing for un-
disclosed taxation. Allow-
ing for the requirements
of the £70,000 of 8 p.c. pref.
capital, the result was equal to
19.5 p.c. on the ordinaries.
In announcing the new bonus
and cash issues, the board says
that it is anticipated that the
dividend will be maintained
at 15 p.c. The co. should at
last be reaping the benefit of
the long-deferred profit tied-up
in the “Australian Encyclo-
paedia.”
After the present new issues
are completed, paid capital will
be £395,000, all but £70,000 of
it in ords.
It is intended to split the 20s.
shares into ss. stock-units.
At present, for the old ords.,
ex rights, the market offers
535., without attracting sellers.
At 60s. the yield would be
5 p.c. on the anticipated
15 p.c. div. basis. And even at
that there should be other
interesting chapters to follow
in the near future.
The A.F.T. Property Trust
A feature of the property-trust
being floated by Aus-
tralian Fixed Trusts Pty., Ltd.,
is that the trust-deed provides
for a small proportion of
readily-marketable shares and
fixed-interest securities to be
included with the real-estate
holdings, which will form the
main body of the trust invest-
ments.
The reason for including
shares and securities is to have
a buffer in case of a sudden
and unusual demand for cash
by unit-holders who wish to
sell. Any registered holder
may request repurchase by the
management company, which
within seven days undertakes
to repurchase or procure
another purchaser at a price
not less than the posted price
for the day.
The A.F.T. Property and
Buildings Trust is managed by
Australian Fixed Trusts, Ltd.,
which pioneered the fixed-trust
movement (originally an all-
share portfolio) in Australia.
Today the A.F.T. group
manages over 50 unit-trusts
with invested funds of over
£35 million.
In its Property and Build-
ings Trust it will be advised by
real-estate agents Raine and
Horne Pty. and Richard
Stanton Pty.
The opening-price of the
units was ss. each, with a mini-
mum holding of 100 units.
The trust has a life of 50
years, but arrangements are
made for buying and selling at
any time. Prices paid are based
on the value of the cash and

The managers are remune-
rated by an initial charge of
81 per cent, of the purchase-
price, and a half-yearly charge
not exceeding 1 p.c. of the
income of the fund. At the
outset the charge will be } of
one per cent, of the average
daily value of the fund during
the six months prior to each

trustees will also receive an
agreed-upon (smaller) fee for
their services.
A.F.T. has received applica-
tions for 4,000,000 ss. units,
which represents a subscrip-
tion of £1,000,000. This has all
come from N.S.W. Advance
applications are soon to be
accepted in Victoria, Queens-
land and S.A. A.F.T. suggests
a return of 7 p.c. p.a. from its
property-units, apart from
long-term capital-appreciation.
Within the few months
since the L. J. Hooker group
formed the first land-trust in
N.S.W. two other groups have
entered the field, and a third
is reported to be on the way.
Already over £2,000,000 has
been subscribed for invest-
ment in real-estate. Operations
of these land-trusts seem bound
to have an effect on the price
of land in the areas where
they operate.
The World’s Gold
At the annual meeting of the
Western Mining Corp.
group of companies, chairman
G. Lindesay Clark said that
monetary trends during the
past year had brought the
subject of gold and its part in
the world’s monetary system
again under discussion.
More than $2,500,000,000
had been transferred from the
gold-reserves of the United
States to the reserves of other
countries, the sharpest fall
since the U.S. reserves reached
their peak in 1949.
This redistribution of gold
in favor of other countries,
Mr. Clark said, reflects no
basic weakness of the dollar,
but rather an improvement in
monetary conditions elsewhere,
which has enabled a further
step towards complete currency
convertibility.
The greater distribution of
gold, said Clark, did not solve
the problem of adequacy of
international reserves to sup-
port the greatly increased
money-value of international
trade. But larger reserves
would benefit the flow of
trade.
Inevitably, he added, the
possibilities of an increase in
the price of gold are being
actively canvassed. “Such pos-
sibilities will ultimately rest on
the recognition of the funda-
mental role of gold in both
national and international
monetary affairs. In these
years of creeping inflation, the
virtues of gold as a basic
medium of exchange are being
recognised afresh, and while it
would be premature to regard
a change in the status of gold
as imminent, it is some
encouragement to note in
recent international gatherings
the growing interest in the
subject.”
Mr. Clark concluded by
noting that increased facilities
for using gold are being made
available through the handling
of gold - bars and gold-
certificates. These moves pro-
vide a convenient method of
holding or trading in gold and
encourage a more active
market. They are therefore
all to the good so far as the
goldminer is concerned.
Ralph Symonds, Ltd.
'T'he co. opened its new ply-
wood factory, built on 26
acres of former mangrove
swamps on the upper reaches
of Parramatta River at Home-
bush Bay, on November 16.
The land was leased from
N.S.W. Maritime Services
Board, which undertook the
reclamation.
With a roof-area of 181
acres, the factory is 1150 ft.
long and 525 ft. wide, and is
claimed to be the largest
single-story arch-building in
the Southern Hemisphere. The
new project will employ 750
workers and is expected to
produce at the rate of
64-million sq.-ft. of plywood a
year. Big savings in cost
should be realised through
using water-transport.
The co. has manufactured
and shipped to Scotland a
complete laminated-timber fac-
tory to be operated by a fully-
owned subsidiary, Ralph
Symonds (Scotland), Ltd.
Gross profit from trading for
the year ended June 30, 1959,
was £38,455 higher at
£313,754. Net profit edged-up
by £15,830 to £124,107 after
writing-off £40,029 deprecia-
tion (up £7041) and paying
£56,000 tax (down £9375) and
£1507 note-issue expenses.
The co. revalued its free-
hold properties, in view of
their contemplated sale, credit-
ing an additional £160,000
book-value to its property
revaluation reserve, shown at
£246,803.
Expenditure on capital- and
trading-assets has in the last
three years exceeded £l|
million, and is expected to be
about £150,000 in the current
term.
In addition to the sub-
sidiary in Scotland, a new
distributing co. [Ralph
Symonds South Africa (Pty.)
Ltd.] was established in South
Africa to cope with increasing
orders.
Subscribed capital remained
at £400,000, in 1,200,000 ss.
ords. and £lOO,OOO 6 p.c. prefs.
Net tangible backing worked
out at 18s. sd. an ord. on the
consolidated accounts. Div.-
rate was steady at 12} p.c.
At last sale ss. stock-units
changed hands at 19s. each,
yielding 3.3 p.c. on the basis
of the 121 p.c. div.

“Moby Dick”
If anything ever deserved the
tag “a tour de force” it is this
Orson Welles rehash of the
widely famed, though sparsely
read, Herman Melville novel.
As presented by Melbourne’s
Union Theatre Repertory
Company, “Moby Dick —
Rehearsed” is indeed a remark-
able piece of theatre —exciting,
hauntingly poetic, with genuine
dramatic life.
Welles has instilled the very
essence of Melville’s symbo-
lism, reinforced its Biblical
connotations and asked of his
actors that by means of gesture
and mime (with the assistance
of an undressed stage, and a
haphazard assortment of
ladders, ropes, spars, boxes
and a sheet of old red curtain)
they describe such disconcert-
ing things as a whale-boat
chase, harpoonings, a storm at
sea, a groaning, rolling ship
and so on.
Somehow it all comes off.
Producer John Sumner’s deftly
chosen cast play-out their
various roles with such utter
conviction that the illusion is
for the greater part of the
evening both sharply created
and effectively sustained.
Welles has employed the
now-familiar device of making
his work a play within a play.
The curtain goes up, and we
are casually introduced to
actors from an old-style pro-
fessional travelling troupe get-
ting ready for a strenuous
rehearsal before the official
props—and audience —arrive.
On the evidence of the open-
ing night this somewhat long-
winded process hardly seemed
necessary: one finds it hard
to imagine that the vivid
impression left by the obsessive
Captain Ahab would have in
any way been sacrificed in a
more conventional theatrical
setting.
What exactly was the object
of Captain Ahab’s fanatical
obsession?
Outwardly, a great white
whale, a monster of the sea
which had once caused Ahab
to lose a leg. Yet at another
level the haunting image of
Moby Dick obviously stands
for something much deeper. A
symbol of evil? That part of
man which must be hunted
down and conquered before he
can attain to God, to truth?
Or does Moby Dick simply
represent the externalisation of
an inner conflict, or. dread,
common to most men ; of a
thing— to paraphrase one of
Shakspeare’s sonnets no
sooner desired “than despised
straight” for the very reason
that it produced the desire in
the first place?
Whatever its roots, Ahab's
obsession certainly invested
him with a terrifying intensity,
alongside of which the
smaller, more worldly consider-
ations of his crew inevitably
paled to insignificance. None-
theless, as superbly portrayed
by a scowling, limping Frank
Thring, the captain’s domin-
ance of the play was rarely
more than it should have been
—which is not always the case
with a Thring characterisation.
At neatly arranged intervals
—which served, in effect, as
much-needed breathing spaces
—lesser characters took the
stage, and surprisingly were
able to do so without becom-
ing entirely lost under the
Stage and Music
“Auntie Mame”
Many of the Firm’s plays
over the past few years have
lacked that real challenge to
the screen that theatre at its
best can give. But “Auntie
Marne,” lately arrived in Bris-
bane, hits right out at the
cinema’s strong point—rapidity
of scene-change—-and wins a
notable victory for flesh-and-
blood theatre.
From the 1920’s to the
present we follow the fortunes
(and crashes) of Marne—from
New York salon before the
Wall Street crash to roller-
skate counter in a chain-store
after that event; from a pill-
ared mansion in the Deep
South to the slopes of the
Matterhorn, and finally back
to New York.
The play has little unity of
plot, but resolves itself into a
series of almost-vaudeville
sketches unified by the presence
of Auntie Marne—a virtuoso
role if ever the 20th-century
American stage offered one ;
and one in which anything less
than spectacular success is utter
failure.
On Broadway it has been
filled by those two ageing
personality-actresses Rosalind
Russell and Constance Bennett
(I thought the latter was dead in
the time of my boyhood that
worshipped her!). Knowing
their work from decades of
films, "it is possible to predict
their approach to the part, and
to affirm that Shirl Conway is
of their calibre. She packs as
solid a punch as her incendiary
cocktail (served at her final
party with pickled rattlesnake
savories —“a little recipe I
picked-up in ‘Walkabout’ ”).
Superbly as Miss Conway
portrayed the flamboyance of
Marne’s way of life, it was the
compassion beneath the flam-
boyance that was most striking.
Without this added dimension
of character the series of
sketches would have become
tiresome. This was the “Marne”
that we have all met at some
fleeting moment in our lives,
here presented for us in
clearer perspective than in life
itself.
It is this power to step across
the footlights into our lives,
and yet in one sense still remain
within the dramatic illusion,
that gives theatre its abiding
strength and superiority; for
rarely can the screen-actress
burst through her celluloid
cocoon. “Auntie Marne’s'’
mad party extends nightly
beyond its wall of footlights to
“include us in.”
Of the vast team of support-
ing players and scene-shifters,
mention must be made of June
Clyne’s dipso, actress, Vera
Charles. Miss Clyne wittily
suggests how awful Miss
Charles must have been even in
her soberer hey-day.

“Elijah”
Last Saturday night, in
Sydney Town Hall, Gerald
Williams conducted the Royal
Philharmonic Society choir and
orchestra and the St. George
Choral Society through Mendel-
ssohn’s “Elijah.” Mendelssohn
isn’t exactly kind to the singers ;
his demands generally are
phrased in orchestral terms;
and when you have a sticky
night and a pretty full hall it
must be a touchy matter for
a conductor to keep everyone
on his toes.
Apart from occasional slack-
ness from the orchestra, parti-
cularly the brass, and one or
two uncertain places in the
vocal score, this was quite a
pleasing concert. The main
fault was enunciation, and
this, to a certain extent, ties-in
with the number of singers
used. The greater the number
of singers, the harder it is to
inject the dual indispensables
of graceful movement and
clarity. x
The choir was strikingly
effective in the “Baal” section
—here Elijah’s recitative is
followed by a thundering
double-chorus, underlined with
agitated instrumental passages
—and William Diamond’s aria,
“Lord God of Abraham,”
showed that this singer is going
from strength to strength.
Paul Edgar, at the organ,
brought the heavy pedal-stops
on with a sonorous roar from
time to time in the marching
adagio parts, most notably at
the end of the chorus “Be Not
Afraid” and again right at the
end, in the “Amen” section
which is so reminiscent of the
general plan in Handel’s
“Messiah.” This was very
welcome, since it covered the
thinness of the double-basses.
Soprano Nita Maughan and
bass William Diamond were
the pick of the soloists,
although contralto Florence
Taylor, in her recitative “The
Lord Hath Exalted Thee,” pro-
jected a good deal of dramatic
urgency.
“Elijah” is programme-
music, and in the hands of a
less-skilled composer might
have been merely another bit
of sugar. It is much harder
than “Messiah,” which, accord-
ing to the programme, is a
coming event.

Bartok Society
Maurice Clare and Marta
Zalan gave a fine concert of
violin and piano music for the
Bartok Society at Sydney Con-
servatorium last Saturday:
two sonatas by the 16th-century
von Biber ; Beethoven’s Op. 30,
No. 2, where Miss Zalan’s full
size as a concert-pianist was
again affirmed; and Bartok’s
second violin-and-piano sonata,
which might be better appre-
ciated at a hundredth perform-
ance.
The audience gave Clare a
truly Bartokian ovation, with
heel-thudding percussion, for
his performance of the Sara-
band, Gigue and Chaconne
from Bach’s No. 2 Partita for
violin unaccompanied—and
rightly so ; it was quite beyond
praise.
Artbursts
McCaughey Prize
The £2OO John McCaughey
Art Prize went this year to
Sydney painter Sali Herman
for his study “Country Street
Scene.”
Despite its clean composi-
tion, simplicity of line, tone
and color, and its cleverly
contrived atmospheric effects,
this work would seem to have
more echoes of Drysdale
(lounging figures outside a
“familiar” country pub) than of
dear old Nature. This could
probably be said about most
of the other entries in the
competition, at present on view
at the Melbourne National
Gallery. Of course the artists
and styles echoed are more
numerous; yet they are still
there and not, as a rule, very
hard to detect.
Again there are several
painters who (running short of
ideas?) have begun echoing
themselves. Notable among
these would be Clifton Pugh,
with his “Summer Solstice,”
Charles Bush and Frank
Werther.
There is, however, a freshly
painted landscape submitted
by Fred Williams, better-than-
average works by Kenneth
Hood, William Gleeson and
Roy Crooke, and on a less
fashionable level there is Dick
Ovenden’s very competently

French Graphic Art
A modest little show of
French graphic art (mostly
lithographs and etchings) at
Sydney Macquarie Galleries
will never arouse either the
enthusiasm or the contro-
versy that other French exhibi-
tions have inspired in recent
years. It is on the large scale
that artists succeed or fail
resoundingly, and these are
minor works.
But if the exhibits are not
exciting they are almost with-
out exception mildly pleasing,
aiming at technical finesse
rather than wild experiment.
They range from Roger
Vieillard’s running women
based on cave-art to Henri de
. Waroquier’s somewhat garish
colored woodcuts of Leda
embracing her swan—with
waterfalls of foliage from
Camille Berg, a comic “Young
Minotaur” from Le Pecq, a
nice back view of Salome from
Michel Ciry and some intrigu-
ing woodlike heads from Col-
lette Pettier.

Pottery
At Sydney’s Clune Galleries
David and Hermia Boyd are
showing a collection of quietly
decorative bits of pottery. The
set of jbrown beer-mugs is
appealing ; so are the capacious
goblets. It is easy to imagine
these things filled, and pleas-
ant to think of emptying them ;
but the huge salt-and-pepper
shakers are quite another pro-
position. In functional terms,
they just won’t do, except
possibly for use at marathon
barbecues. Again, the shape
of the cups in the coffee-sets
is somewhat defeated by
thickish rims and by the dusky,
seaweedy color—they would
probably be best as decora-
tions, although they might be
used, at a pinch, in oak-lined
drawing-rooms or in a beatnik
garret.
But for 35 gns. someone
can have Hermia Boyd’s
splendid “Owl”: life-size, with
braced legs and, most properly,
a quizzical expression. There
is a claret-pot in the shape of
a bull’s head, and it would be
novel to pour out a drink from
it, provided the claret could
be successfully manoeuvred
down one of the horns. The
salad-bowls are large and use-
ful-looking, and the roosters
with shrubbery growing out of
the places where their heads
and feathers ought to be have
the twin merit of novelty and
humor.
Films
Three Faces of Sex
Sex rears a head by turns
frightening, ribald and sun-
tanned in three films lately
released in Sydney.
Provided you don’t look for
convincing answers, “Blue
Jeans” (Embassy) is an
interesting treatment of the
old problem of what a pair
of adolescent lovers should do
when, through their innocent
ardor, the girl gets pregnant.
They should, of course, tell
their folks. But their folks
are so imperceptive and insen-
sitive to the needs of adol-
escence that communication
with them is difficult at the
best of times; and of course
marriage without their consent
is impossible.
Abortion, then, seems to be
the only answer ; so they go
fearfully about arranging it.
The boy, however, gets into
trouble raising the fee, has to
confide at last in his father,
and only a desperate chase
saves the girl from the dubious
care of the suitably ugly
doctor.
With abortion condemned
and the parents knowing all,
the script prescribes marriage,
helping it down with the
implication that this young
love, being wholesome and
true, will somehow overcome
the obstacles one cannot help
seeing stretched out intermin-
ably before it.
The plea, if any, is simply
for chastity (though the hero;s
I shouldn t have let this
happen” admits of more than
one interpretation) or, failing
that, for better understanding
between parents and children,
Most of it is presented,
however, in very credible
human terms by Brandon de
Wilde and Carol Lynley, as the
harassed couple; Macdonald
Carey and Marsha Hunt, as
the boy’s parents ; and notably
by Warren Berlinger, as a wise-
cracking pseudo-tough who
grows fiercely wise and tender
in his friends’ trouble.
The other faces of sex men-
tioned above can be found in,
respectively, “The Mating
Game” (St. James and Metros)
and “Gidget” (Lyceum).
The first takes H. E. Bates’s
story “The Darling Buds of
May” (sober tax - officer
beating-up business on farm is
turned into a lover of life —
or at any rate the facts of it —
by the farmer’s highly nubile
daughter), transplants it for the
sake of accents from England
to Maryland (U.S.) and heavily
topdresses it with agricultural
innuendo.
Debbie Reynolds mixes play-
ful charm and sheer animal
spirits as the daughter ; Tony
Randall reveals a subtle turn
of humor as the converted tax-
man ; and Paul Douglas, dis-
armingly bluff and candid,
personifies the farmer who has
found an ideal (i.e., taxless)
philosophy of life.
“Gidget” is a spirited but
directionless inquiry into what
a girl has to do, be, say and
wear if she is going to amount
to anything in the set of fairly
well-heeled adolescents who
spend their holidays at a
Californian seaside-resort.


his fire, the hideous gape-
jawed head of an estuarine
crocodile.
Darrow screamed and threw
the stick. It went to just one
side of the beast, which jerked
its head quickly and snapped
its jaws on it. Holding it
crosswise in its mouth it
crunched through, and Darrow
watched in fascination as the
two small end pieces dropped
to the ground.
After another minute, dur-
ing which Darrow stood
paralysed, it started towards
him. Its entire 25ft. body was
in the open space before he
was able to move a muscle.
Then he bent to the fire,
snatched-up a burning brand
and flung it at the creature’s
head. It struck on the snout,
showering it with embers. The
crocodile backed halfway into
the jungle, roaring as it went.
Its breath was foul and the
stench hit Darrow like a blow.
They stood there: Darrow
in the centre, the crocodile on
the fringe, half in and half
out of the jungle. Darrow’s
legs were weakening. He
thought of running, but was
terrified of plunging around
in the dark jungle with the
monster at his heels.
For perhaps 15 minutes they
kept their positions ; then,
still not taking his eyes from
the crocodile, Darrow built-up
the fire. The beast again
began to roar, swaying from
side to side. The man thought
that it was preparing a quick
lunge at him, and decided to
run, but the crocodile edged
backwards through the jungle
the way it had come, until
Darrow could no longer
hear it.
He couldn’t believe it. It
seemed to him somehow wrong
that he had escaped death and
that the crocodile had been
deprived of a meal. This was
not a morbid thought, nor did
he pursue it to the point of
feeling obliged to rush after
the reptile and set matters
right: it was part of the
hysterical chaos of his plung-
ing and whirling brain follow-
ing on its retreat.
Tt was still not yet midnight,
A but he didn’t dare to get
back under his blanket. The
most he permitted himself was
to sit with his back to the
fire while fixing his eyes on
the jungle at the place where
the crocodile had emerged and
departed.
After an hour he felt him-
self dropping into sleep, so he
got to his feet and piled more
wood on the fire. He went
back to his former position,
and he felt sleep engulfing him
again.
Next minute he was fighting
for his life.
He heard, smelt and saw
the crocodile coming, not stop-
ping at the edge of the bare
ground as before, but rushing
straight on to him with jaws
agape and wildly-rolling eyes.
He didn’t have time to get
to his feet. He flung himself
out of the creature’s path. Its
impetus carried it onto the fire,
and burning logs and embers
were scattered all over the
clearing. It began bellowing
and swiftly turned to face him.
Not pausing a second it
hurled itself at him again, jaws
biting at the air.
Darrow had got to his feet,
just as the beast had made its
turn, carrying with him a brand
from the bestrewn fire. And
now as it turned its head side-
ways and sought to grab the
man by his thighs, he skipped
back a pace and with an under-
arm movement thrust the 2ft.-
long, 4in.-thick, still-burning
brand into its mouth. It
snapped shut its jaws and
swallowed. Darrow ran past
it to the other side of the
clearing
Not turning, the crocodile
lashed its tail furiously from
side to side, sweeping to
within a foot of Darrow as he
stood between two saplings at
the edge of the clearing. A
blow from the tail would kill
him instantly if it struck above
the groin or smash his legs if
it struck below.
"Smoke-oh!"
But after thrashing the area
behind it for half-a-minute,
bellowing and grunting, the
crocodile burst away into the
jungle, and soon Darrow heard
it plunge into the river.
For the next five minutes he
could hear its swirlings in the
water and its grunting and
roaring, and then the night
was silent again.
He was shaking as though
with malaria, and couldn’t
think, but continued to stand
between the saplings, clutching
at them for support. Then,
after the night had been
quiet for a few minutes, he
left the saplings and tried
to put his fire together again ;
but each time he picked up
a brand he would stand with
it in his hand, not seeing it
or knowing he had it until it
burnt him.
In the end he just sat down
where the fire had been, and
looked at the stars, and waited
for the crocodile to come back,
and still didn’t think about the
crocodile, or about anything.
And when, after a couple of
hours, the crocodile came
back, he threw all the pieces
of firewood at it, one by one,
every time it pushed forward
into the clearing. And every
time it would move back for
a few minutes.
Then there was nothing left
to throw. The crocodile crept
to within 6ft. of him. Picking
up the gallon can he used for
all his cooking, he began to
beat on it with his spoon.
The crocodile moved back
and - started bellowing again.
He continued to beat on the
can with the spoon, and some-
times when the crocodile moved
closer he put his spoon aside
and banged the can on the
ground between them.
Just before daybreak the
crocodile went away, but
Darrow kept on hitting the tin-
can with his spoon until the
sun outclimbed the jungle
growth and shone into the
clearing.
Then he rolled his stuff in
his blanket and went down to
the river, but couldn’t gather
the courage to go in. He sat
there all day until the sun
was sitting on a western hill.
Then, when the sun was
gone, he thought also of the
rivers behind him, and the
little cleared patch of ground
100yds. up the hill, with the
ashes in the middle and the
huge imprints here and there.
He lowered himself into the
last crossing of the Bloomfield
River and swam to the other
side.

For the average person, no other form
of investment offers such a degree
of capital-protection as the life-policy.
Recognition of this fact, plus the growth
of population, inflation (which has in-
creased the need for greater life-cover)
and the development of group-assurance
and superannuation-schemes, has con-
tributed to the great expansion of
assurance business in the last decade:

The last few years have seen an un-
precedented influx of new life-offices to
Australia. Several British cos. are
already writing business in Australia and
many more are surveying the ground.
Oldest and largest mutual life office
in the British Commonwealth, the 110-
year-old A.M.P. Society writes a big
share of the record amounts of new
assurance taken-out over recent years.
Impressive financial strength and com-
petitive premiums and bonus-rates have
assisted the A.M.P. to chalk-up a series
of record-breaking figures. In the term
to December 31, 1958, despite increased
competition, income, assets, new busi-
ness, payments to policyholders and the
amount of reversionary bonuses distri-
buted, all rose to new levels.
At balance-date, there were 2,707,668
policies in force in the ordinary and
industrial departments, assuring a total
(including £143 million in bonuses) of
£1576 million. The sum assured under
new business in 1958 rose by £13.9
million to £197.1 million (an increase
of 7.5 p.c.) and of the total a little over
94 p.c. was written in the ordinary
department. Total life-assurance cover
in Australia, including reversionary-
bonus additions, reached approximately
£3500 million at the close of 1958.
Taken together, the two departments
lifted premium-income by £3.3 million
to £44 million and after deducting £1.7
million for income and land taxes,
gathered in a net £17.1 million (up
£2.2 million) in interest, divs., rent, etc.
Total income rose to £61.1 million (up
£5.4 million and equivalent to an increase
of 9.7 p.c.):

A successful campaign was waged
against rising costs. The O.D. (ordinary
department), which handles the greater
part of the society’s underwriting busi-
ness, achieved a considerable reduction
in the relative incidence of operating-
costs despite increased complexity and
diversity of activity. Expressed as a
percentage of premium-revenue, expenses
of management in respect of ordinary
business fell from 14.82 p.c. to 14.6 p.c.,
funds benefiting accordingly. In the I.D.
(industrial department), where numerous
small premium payments have to be
dealt with, the ratio rose slightly to
28.06 p.c. (up .16 p.c.). When all claims
and expenses had been met, and after
writing £438,753 (up £240,646) off the
book-values of certain assets and pro-
viding for a loss of £105,901 on the sale
of others, and currency-exchange adjust-
ments (£412,598, up £186,065), £29.7
million of the term’s income remained
to be added to the life - funds
(£393,545,016).
Extensive mechanisation of account-
ing-procedures and a tendency towards
larger individual policies have played a
considerable part in checking the growth
of the expense-rate, which, as far as
controllable expenses are concerned, has
remained relatively stable. The recent
installation of advanced electronic com-
puting-equipment should help reverse the
upward tendencies in the I.D. and make
for greater savings in the O.D.
Until recently, life-offices have been
strict adherents to the principle of
absolute security in investment of their
funds; but the pressure from higher-
yielding alternatives which are becom-
ing increasingly available to potential
policyholders has necessitated a revision
of traditional practice. Greater yields
are now being sought so as to enable
distribution of more attractive bonuses.
The commensurably higher risk is
justified in the knowledge that better
returns will, when averaged over the
entire portfolio, more than compensate
for any loss of capital in unsuccessful
individual investment.
Last term the A.M.P. channelled funds
increasingly to commerce and industry
rather than to Government securities.
Holdings of debentures and shares rose
by £6 million to £43 million and loans
on mortgage, a big proportion of which
relate to housing, lifted by £14.4 million
to £164 million. By comparison Govern-
ment and semi-government loans showed
only slight movement, rising to £158.5
million (up £6.6 million). As a result,
effective net interest-rate, after deduc-
tion of income- and land-taxes, worked-
out at £4 13s. 9d. p.c., a generous ss.
p.c. better than in the previous term.
To arrive at the surplus (£14.9 million,
up £2 million and after sending £500,000
to investment and contingency reserve,
and covering exchange-adjustments, etc.)
available for distribution among policy-
holders, the society’s liabilities under
policies in force, with the exception of
certain contracts on the N.Z. register,
were actuarilly valued at an unchanged
2 p.c. net-premium basis for assurances
with deferred participation, 2\ p.c. for
policies with immediate participation and

the distribution being the largest ever
made by the A.M.P.; bonus-rates were
at their highest level in 28 years. The
total amount of additional assurance
created by the division of the surplus
was £24.3 million.

In 1958, the A.M.P. formed two sub-
sidiary cos., both wholly-owned, the
A.M.P. Fire and General Insurance Co.,
Ltd., and the A.M.P. Fire and General
Insurance Co. (N.Z.), Ltd. Managing-
agent for the former is United Insurance
Co., Ltd., and for the latter South British
Insurance Co., Ltd. Results to date have
been most encouraging and the cos.
can be expected to swell the surplus
from which policyholders in the parent
A.M.P. receive bonuses. Further funds
can be anticipated from the newly formed
Discount Corporation of Australia, Pty.
(formed early in the current term to
commence operations as an authorised
dealer co. in the official short-term
money market in Australia) in which
the society has a major shareholding.
Rapid progress is the keynote of the
society’s building-project at Sydney Cove
and tenders have been called for a new
11 -story office-building in Auckland.

Life-assurance affords the individual
and the nation a unique and indis-

of this fact influenced the Common-
wealth Government to grant increased
tax-concessions in its latest budget.
Maximum deductions allowable to any
one person on life-assurance premiums
were raised from £3OO to £4OO per
annum.
The A.M.P. Society, through its
balanced investment policy and through
its entry into the fire and general in-
surance field and (in Australia) through
its activities on the official short-term
money-market, is playing a deserving
i ole in ensuring that domestic resources
of capital are marshalled and put to
effective use in the development of the
economies of both Australia and New
Zealand.
Thiess Holdings, Ltd.
"Decoming a “classic” by trebling its
** P aid capital in the last six months,
the Thiess civil-engineering business was
established in Queensland in 1933.
In May, 1958, the co. acquired public
status by placing 450,000 ss. ords. on
the sharemarket at a weighty premium
(3s. Byd. a stock-unit), plus charges.
However, the takers were quickly
rewarded by a 40 p.c. capital gain, in
addition to collecting the 8| p.c. final
div.
A year later, in May, 1959, Thiess
issued a further 1,751,480 ords., one-
for-one, at par, doubling its paid capital
(to £875,740), and raising £437,870 addi-
tional working-capital. Last Friday the
co. announced another one-for-two issue
(at ss. a unit premium). Paid-up capital
will be £1,313,610, and the total realised
£875,740 (including £437,870 premium).
Earthmover, civil-engineering contrac-
tor and coalminer, the Thiess group also
deals in heavy-engineering machinery,
operates a garage at Muswellbrook
(N.S.W.), where it has a Ford franchise
for the area, and undertakes the steve-
doring of colliers which ship Callide coal
from Gladstone (Q.). In April, 1959, a
new fully-owned subsidiary (Thiess Sales
Pty.) was established to operate the
group’s newly-acquired Queensland fran-
chise for Japanese Toyota land-cruisers.
Workshops are owned at Yeerongpilly
and Miami (both in Q.), and at Mascot
and Muswellbrook (N.S.W.). Land is
owned in various places, held in reserve
for future expansion.
Subsidiaries of Thiess Holdings, Ltd.,
are as follows:
Queensland: Thiess Bros. (Q’ld.) Pty.,
Ltd.: Thiess Transport Services Pty.; Thiess
(Northern Territory) Pty.; Thiess Bros.
(Blair Athol) Pty.; Gladstone Stevedoring
Pty.; Consolidated Coals of Aust. Pty.;
Thiess Callide Coal Pty. (and its wholly-
owned subsidiaries, Callide Opencut
Collieries Pty. and Biloela Opencut Pty.).
New South Wales: Thiess Bros. Pty.;
Thiess (Repairs) Pty.;. Thiess Construction
Ply.; Farm and Transport Service Pty.;
Commercial Development Pty.; Heavy
Equipment (N.S.W.) Pty.
Victoria: Thiess Bros. (Vic.) Pty.
Queensland, N.S.W. and Victoria:
American Heavy Equipment Pty., Thiess
Sales Pty.
The biggest deal secured by Thiess to
date was landed in June, 1958, when the
group contracted with S.M.H.E.A. to
divert the Tooma River (N.S.W.) into
the Tumut River, as part of the Snowy
Mountains hydroelectric scheme. The
job is worth £9 million gross.
The first full year of business as a
public co. resulted in a net profit of
£146,173 (up £40,784), earned during the
12 months ended June 30, 1959:

The result was achieved after writing-
off a solid depreciation whack of
£542,715. The huge £343,941 increase
was caused by the co.’s cautious policy
in the light of extra equipment bought
during the year for expanded operations
of the group. Tax-provision was
£41,442 higher at £100,948.
The div. was steady at 16f p.c.,
absorbing £72,978, but applied only to
the old issue of stock-units (totalling
£437,870). The new share-capital’s par-
ticipation in profits did not start till
July 1, 1959.
Reserves received £73,195, but were
reduced by “adjustments being propor-
tion applicable to minority and for a co.
no longer a subsidiary” (£847). There
was also an unexplained £2541 reduction
in reserves. An independent valuation of
land and buildings and a write-up of
certain book-values resulted in a surplus
of £BO,OOO tucked away in a newly-
created assets-revaluation reserve.
Total reserves and unappropriated
profits were shown at £788,633, subject

The most important change in the co.’s
financial structure, other than the share-
capital increase, was repayment of
£125,000 convertible notes under terms
of the trust-deed between Thiess Bros,
and the noteholders.
Unsecured loans were reduced by
£22,500 to £157,500, but loans on
mortgage went up by £848,197 to
£1,335,622. Overdraft was £92,175
higher at £208,684. Total borrowings
therefore increased by £792,872.
Book-value of freeholds and lease-
holds was £23,929 higher at £380,089.
Plant and machinery leapt by £629,611
to £1,816,036. Stocks and work-in-
progress went up by £890,460, reflecting
the huge funds engaged in carrying-out
the contracts in hand. Net tangible
assets - cover (excluding overburden-
removal account and coal-mining leases,
totalling £128,204) worked-out at 9s. per
ss. stock-unit.

times, but so far the odds
seemed to favor Thiess. The
shareholders have had a very
fair run over past years. Last
term conditions were not
easy in the contracting field,
and the group was faped with
some “uneconomic tendering
from its smaller competitors.”
The fact that Thiess managed
along quite comfortably is a
tribute to its vitality and
imaginative and competent
management.
On the brighter side is the
trend towards letting-out more
work by Government and semi-
governmental authorities.
At September 30, 1959, the
value of contracts held by
Thiess was about £15,000,000.
The group’s tender for the con-
struction of the Moondatia
Dam in Latrobe Valley (Vic.),
to the tune of £1,000,000, was
recommended to the Govern-
ment. Official acceptance was
received for designing and
construction - work on the
Hume Weir reservoir (N.S.W.),
estimated to cost £380,000.
The co. has forecast a div.-
rate of 10 p.c. on the full new
capital, but shareholders may
expect further benefits from
share-issues as more and more
capital is needed for Thiess’
swelling activities. There is no
immediate intention to make a
new bonus hand-out from the
assets-revaluation reserve.
At the last sale the ss. ords.
changed hands at 16s. l\d.
making the yield 3 p.c. on the
basis of the forecast 10 p.c.
div.-rate.
Marrickville Holdings, Ltd.
r T~'HE group comprises the
-*• parent-co. and its four
wholly-owned subsidiaries:
Marrickville Margarine l J ty.; Nut
Food* Pty.; Marrickville Margarine
(Qld.) Pty; and J. S. Corden and
Co. Pty. (a new acquisition).
Marrickville manufactures
table- and cooking-margarines,
and edible and industrial oils.
The group’s products are
mostly marketed under the
popular “Eta” trade-mark.
Factories are in Sydney,
Newcastle (N.S.W.), Brisbane
and South Melbourne. Recent
expansion includes newly-com-
pleted factories in Adelaide,
Townsville (Q.) and Braybrook
(Vic.). The Newcastle plant
was substantially enlarged.
Further building-additions are
being made to the main factory
at Marrickville (N.S.W.).
There is an export-trade, and
in 1958 the co. was appointed
Australian distributor for
certain products of Procter
and Gamble (U.S.A.).
Margarine is manufactured
in all States under a quota
system, to protect dairy-pro-
ducers, but the legislation is
not always strictly enforced.
A few years back there was a
loud outcry from the smaller
inter-State manufacturers when
the N.S.W. Government raised
the State’s oleomargarine pro-
duction-quota from 2500 to
9000 tons.
Commenting on Marrick-
ville’s accounts for 1958, The
Bulletin said : “Only initiates
into the inner mysteries of this
group’s accounting procedure
can have any real notion of
what does actually roll into the
co. coffers.” Since then the
position has not changed. The
co. does, however, disclose its
tax-provision, which is more
than some do.
It can be safely stated,
though, that the group is
certainly making the profits
claimed and some more.
Last term’s tax-provision was
shown as £334,141, or almost
97 p.c. of the disclosed taxed
net profit. (In the preceding
year tax wejls shown £20,866
above the revealed net earn-
ings).
Last term, as in the preceding
year, all subsidiaries traded
profitably. Net profit for
the twelve months ended June
30, 1959, was disclosed at
£346,468 (up £7352):

The result was declared after
providing £334,141 for taxa-
tion (down £25,841!), and
writing-off £190,391 for depre-
ciation. The latter write-off
was £37,222 higher than the
previous year’s provision, and
seems more than adequate,
even allowing for the new plant
installed. The disclosed earn-
ing-rate was 26.7 p.c. on the
average ord. capital.
The div.-rate remained
steady at 15 p.c., but absorbed
£2788 more because of the
post-balance-date issue of
44,375 stock-units participating
in the div.-distribution for
1958-59. Prefs. received £9500
(unchanged) and £144,246 went
to reserves (shown at £1,807,651
but subject to £456,250 intan-
gibles at balance-date).
There were no capital
changes during the period
under review. The visible net
tangible asset-backing worked-
out at 41s. sd. a 20s. ord. (on
capital as at 30/6/’59).
Major developments occurred
soon after the closing of
accounts. The co. issued 44,375
stock-units (at an undisclosed
premium) for investment pur-
poses, including the acquisition
of its long-time W.A. agent,
J. S. Corden and Co. Pty., of
P ert h.
Marrickville’s patient stock-
holders were then generously
rewarded by a handsome one-
for-two bonus hand-out on
Nov. 6, 1959. When completed,
the new issue (made from
assets-revaluation and share-
premium reserves) will bring
paid-up capital to £1,960,500
in ords. and £200,000 in prefs.
This massive rise in equity
should take care of any unwel-
come takeover bids, in addi-
tion to padding-out the scrip-
owners’ wallets.
Another important step was
an arrangement with the
A.MP. Society, which is
taking-up £600,000-worth of
unsecured notes, and has

All these loud rumblings
indicate that the group is about
to start an extensive expan-
sion-programme. It is certainly
in a position to do so.
Although the effect of con-
servative valuation of the fixed
assets should not be overrated,

fixed assets went up by
£415,799 to £2,269,614. (Land

tion). Disclosed expenditure on
fixed assets was £606,190.
Following the one-for-two
bonus-issue on November 6,
the 20s. ords. dropped from
110 s. to 655. (buyer), but then,
moved up to 725. 6d. A 124 p.c.
div.-rate on the new capital
was forecast by the co., and
the yield on this basis is 3.4 p.c.
On its past record Marrick-
ville should have no difficulty
in paying the larger div.-cheque
on the bigger capital and still
keep a tidy bit in the kitty.
Regent Motors (Holdings),
Ltd.
"pouNDED in Melbourne nine
x years ago, Regent Motors
(Holdings), Ltd., set-off by
issuing 240,000 10s. ords. to
an established proprietory co.
of similar name in acquisition
of its £15,000 paid-up capital.
A further 200,000 10s. ords.
were offered to the public at
par in April, 1951. A later
private issue of 7000 ords.
raised paid capital to £223,500.
In April, 1959, the co. made
a one-for-one bonus hand-out
(two ss. ords. for every 10s.
of stock) capitalising the
£223,500 assets - revaluation
reserve, created by a revalua-
tion of its scrip in Spencer
Motors Pty. (described as a
wholly-owned subsidiary). This
brought paid-up capital to the
present level of £447,000, split
into ss. ords. At the same
time authorised capital was
increased to £1 million.
The holding-co. operates
through three wholly-owned
subsidiaries, and was one of the
three Australian cos. to obtain
a direct interest (12} p.c. of the
shareholding) in the local
manufacture of Volkswagen
vehicles. The co. holds the
Australian franchise for
Volkswagen cars and trucks.
It is also a highly successful
distributor of Rover and
Land/Rover vehicles (in Tas-
mania and Victoria).
Last year’s bonus-issue was
a bright ray in an otherwise
difficult year, during which the
co. had experienced varying
fortunes
The first six months “resulted
in profits comparable to the
corresponding period of the
previous year.” However, the
second half-year was marked
by very strong competition,
increased selling-costs and a
shortage in the supply of
Volkswagen vehicles which
restricted trading. There was a
substantial reduction in the
margin on country- and metro-
politan-agent sales.
Sales of Rover and Land/
Rover vehicles were affected by
difficulties associated with
the change of models.
Despite these handicaps, the
co. reports a record year in
Volkswagen sales. The switch-
over to new Rover models was
successfully completed and
there is a five-months’ waiting-
list for the new P 5 Land/Rover
model.
These difficulties had the
effect of almost halving the
net profit for the year ended
June 30, 1959. Earnings fell by
£97,776 to £108,085:

Revenue did not include any
dividends from the 12} p.c.
holding in Volkswagen (A’sia)
Pty., which had not completed
its first year of operations.
Profit was arrived at after
providing £14,119 (up £1562)
for depreciation and amortisa-
tion, paying directors’ and
auditors’ fees and setting-aside
£74,200 (down £54,800) for
taxation.
Dividend was paid at the
rate of 15 p.c. on the new
£447,000 capital (or 30 p.c. on
the old pre-bonus capital),
absorbing £67,050. The div -
cheque was made up of a 10
p.c. final div. on the post-bonus
capital and a 10 p.c. interim on
the pre-bonus capital. Reserves
received £41,035 (down
£108,951), and also benefited by
£1022 profit on sale of assets
and £3341 tax overprovision,
but were depleted by £15,095

The earning-rate on the
larger average share-capital
dropped from 92.1 p.c. to 32.2

performance.
Revaluation of the co.’s
shareholding in Spencer
Motors Pty., Ltd., had resulted
in the creation of £223,500
assets-revaluation reserve, from
which the one-for-one bonus-
issue was made during the year.
This operation left a trace in
the form of £223,500 rise in
goodwill, deducted from
reserves and undistributed
profits, shown at £527,656:

TASTY SUPPER ■ HASTY DEATH
NICOL CHEMICAL CO. PTY. LTD., Brisbane.
MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY
YX/Tm its revenues running
** at a high level, the N.Z.
Government has announced
cuts in indirect taxes estimated
to amount to £lO million in a
year.
Customs duty on petrol has
been reduced by 4d. a gallon,
making the price 3s. lOd. at
main ports. Sales-tax on
cigarettes and beer has been
abolished. This brings the
price of 20 cigarettes down by
3d. to 2s. 7d.
The price of beer has yet to
be decided by the Price
Tribunal. There is some differ-
ence of opinion about it.
Finance Minister Nordmeyer
says it should fall by 2d. to 7d.
for an Boz. glass, but the pub-
licans say the reduction
amounts to only Id. a glass,
making the price Bd.—and
that’s what they’re charging at
present.
To keep the Government’s
“generosity” in perspective, it
should be remembered that
drastic tax-increases were im-
posed last year. Petrol-duty
was lifted by Is. a gallon ;
beer-duty was doubled, increas-
ing the price to the drinker
from 6d. for a 9oz. glass to
9d. for an Boz. glass ; duty on
cigarettes w'as more than
doubled, increasing the price
of a packet of 20 from 2s. to
2s. lOd.
It’s pretty plain that the
consumer is now being relieved
of slightly less than one-third
of the heavy extra taxation
imposed as an emergency mea-
sure when export prices were
at a low ebb and overseas
funds were strained.
The Government’s political
opponents say that more sub-
stantial tax-reductions are
being saved for next year to
put the electors in a good
mood before the polls.
Opposition-leader Holyoake
says: “The pattern of Labor's
1960 election - strategy was
clearly indicated in Mr. Nord-
meyer’s first Budget in 1958.
Labor’s policy was to scare the
people with warnings of pend-
ing slump conditions and to
tax them to the hilt, with a
view to making some conces-
sions in 1959, followed by
handsome handouts in 1960 —
election-year.
This expresses, pretty well,
the popular view. People are
still sore over the savage tax-
increases which followed the
“£lOO tax-rebate” used as
election-bait by Labor.
Reviewing the public ac-
counts for the half-year to
September 30, Mr. Nordmeyer
indicated that the Budget esti-
mates of taxation for the full
financial year may be exceeded.
Expenditure is running close
to the estimates.
Overseas Trading
N.Z.’s overseas - exchange
transactions for the year to
September 30 showed a sur-
plus of £4l million, against a
deficit of £30.1 million in the
previous year.
The figures included £10.5
million of net official overseas-
borrowing, against £22.2 mil-
lion in 1958. Current-account
surplus was £24.5 million,
against a deficit of £54.9 mil-
lion in 1958. Total receipts
increased by £33.8 million to
£359.3 million.
High earnings for all export-
commodities except meat
increased export-income by
£32.8 million to £296.7 million.
Butter-receipts rose by £lB.l
million, reflecting the improve-
ment in the price obtained for
butter on the U.K. market,
together with a heavier volume
of sales, mainly due to reduc-
tion of stocks.
Receipts for cheese advanced
by £6.5 million, due to higher
prices and the improvement of
£5.4 million in the receipts for
'wool reflected the upward
trend in wool-prices.
Total payments fell by £37.4
million to £318.2 million. This
was caused mainly by a fall
of £53.9 million to £232.7
million in payments for
imports. Government imports
declined by 18.5 per cent, to
£26.5 million and private
imports by 18.9 per cent, to
£206.2 million.
An offsetting increase in
“other” Government payments
of £5.9 million arose mainly
from the repayment of the one-
year credit arranged with a
group of American banks
headed by I. P. Morgan and
Company of £3.6 million.
“Other” private payments,
which increased by £9.2 mil-
lion, include the repayment of
the advance made by the
Commonwealth Bank of Aus-
tralia to the Reserve Bank of
New Zealand of £7.5 million.
Japanese Subsidiary
The Toyomenka Company,
one of lapan’s “Big Five”
trading and manufacturing
cartels, has formed a £50,000
New Zealand subsidiary, Toyo-
menka (N.Z.) Ltd.
Toyomenka is the Japanese
firm which started the importa-
tion of N.Z. timber through
Tauranga. They will enter a
number of other fields and
co-operate with some of N.Z.’s
leading merchants. The new
co. is registered as general
merchant and importer, but its
objects range from coalmining
and brewing to general mer-
chandising.
Toyomenko is a giqnt cartel
doing banking- and insurance-
business, steel - manufacture,
shipbuilding and other manu-
facturing. It owns oil-wells
and trades in a large number
of commodities.
Oil Exploration
The present series of tests
in the No. 1 oil exploration
well at Kapuni has been com-
pleted, according to the direc-
tors of Shell, B.P. and Todd
Oil Services, Ltd.
Tests proved the presence of
wet gas in the structure that
the well ’ was planned to
explore. The production of
gas alone would be a doubtful
economic proposition and
would require careful study.
To obtain additional evidence
essential for quantitative esti-
mates it will be necessary to
drill further wells on the same
structure.
The drilling-rig used for
Kapuni No. 1, however, has
not the capacity to drill to the
depths at which possible
reservoir-sands may occur in
these new locations. It is pro-
posed, therefore, to acquire
from overseas a heavier rig
which will be more appropri-
ate for drilling to these great
depths.
In the meantime the present
rig will be transferred to the
East Coast.
In Taranaki an additional
seismic survey will be under-
taken (a method which the
company was the first to use
on an intensive scale in New
Zealand) to complete the sur-
vey of other possible structures
which have not yet been
explored in sufficient detail.
By the time the heavier
drilling-equipment arrives full
information should be avail-
able to the company on the
prospects of further drilling on
the West Coast.
The geology of New Zea-
land is highly complicated and
has so far defied attempts at
successful oil-exploration, the
history of which dates back to
the 1860’s. This co. has spent
about £1,500,000 in four years,
and a new rig will cost several
hundred thousand pounds.
Volume of Production
A preliminary estimate of
the value of N.Z.’s production
for 1958-59 is £646 million, an
increase of £5.6 million, or one
per cent, over the revised
1957-58 figure of £640.8 million,
according to the Department
of Statistics.
Increases in the factory-
group from £188.3 million to
£202.3 million, or seven per
cent., and “other primary”
from £44.4 million to £46.9
million, or six per cent., are
partly offset by a decrease in
farming from £340.8 million to
£329.8 million, or three per
cent.
The volume - of - production
index for all groups shows a
rise of four per cent, in the
latest year, the increases for
both farming and for factory
production being also four per
cent. The volume of produc-
tion for 1958-59 is 90 per cent,
higher than in 1938-39.
An increase of 33 per cent,
ds indicated for volume of
production per head of popu-
lation over the same period.
The increase per head from
1957-58 to 1958-59 is estimated
at two per cent.


Memoirs of a
Pioneer Pressman
(Abridged from a book to be published later)
BLUFF OLD SIR JOHN
By B. S. BAXTER COOK
(Founder of the Australian Journalists’ Association and No. 1 A.J.A. Gold Medallist)
Living in an atmosphere
of intrigues, stratagems
and spoils to the victors,
newspaper roundsmen
have to be always alert to the
straws that may indicate the
direction of the wind toward
secret happenings in the poli-
tical world.
Sometimes, however, they
allow their news-sense of antici-
pation to run riot. Typical
was the occasion in the early
days of Federation when the
Prime Minister and former
S'John, caught at his Parliamentary ease.
members of State Cabinets
were gradually denuding them-
selves of the State environment
and cultivating the Federal
spirit.
Pressmen were waiting in a
nearby corridor in the first
Commonwealth offices at the
corner of Collins and Spring
Streets, in Melbourne, for the
newly appointed Administra-
tion led by Sir Edmund
Barton, as Prime Minister, to
rise for lunch.
The first to emerge from
the Cabinet-rooms was bluff
Sir John Forrest, playfully
referred to as “The King of
ihe West” in recognition of
his great individual services to
Western Australia. He was
red-faced.
“What’s doing, Sir John?”
asked a reporter.
“Huh!” grunted Sir John,
“Too many captains.”
He declined to amplify his
remark, but it was a sufficient
text for some imaginative
pressmen to vamp-up a stirring
story headed “Early Dissen-
sions in the Cabinet.”
Other Ministers laughed at
the newspaper report, but
refused to discuss what had
given rise to it. Deakin simply
remarked: “Dear old Sir.
John! He finds it difficult to
accustom himself to the fact
that this is a Federal Cabinet,
not a State one with himself
as head man.”
Sir John was a typical
example of the unpolitical type
of Premier in the early days.
Transparently honest in all his
dealings, he had a horror of
underground political schem-
ing, and was deservedly popu-
lar on both sides of the House.
In a stirring scene in the
House of Representatives in
1909, when a Deakin-Cook
attack defeated the first Fisher
Government, feelings ran hot
and the air was filled with
accusations of treachery, deceit,
dishonorable conduct, etc.
Sir John, in his simple old
way, calmly interjected (as
Lyne was fulminating in his
thunderous voice), “You
shouldn’t tell tales out of
school! ”
It was such an anticlimax
that some members laughed
outright, despite the tense
atmosphere.
When the bill to provide for
the construction of the East-
West railway was before the
House of Representatives there
was some criticism, particu-
larly from Labor members, of
the probable cost.
“Why, this project will run
into a million pounds!”
exclaimed an alarmed member.
“What’s a million?” growled
Sir John.
The House went into a gale
of laughter at the casual way
the “King of the West” brushed
aside the possible expenditure
of a sum which, in those pre-
inflation days, seemed astrono-
mical.
Sir John was sure of his
ground, however, as he had
extracted a promise from the
other Premiers that the railway
to connect the West with the
eastern States would be one of
the first big public works of
the Commonwealth.
It is rather a curious com-
mentary that the East-West
line is one of the few long-
distance railways in Australia
that are paying their way.
Today, with public men talk-
ing glibly of developmental
schemes involving the expen-
diture of hundreds of millions,
we are inclined, in our turn,
to smile at a one-single-million
idea being so extraordinary as
to cause derisive laughter
among Federal members.
When Sir John Forrest was
created a peer in 1918 and
became Baron Forrest of Bun-
bury, I called at his hotel in
Melbourne to offer my con-
gratulations. He was engaged.
Chatting with Lady Forrest, 1
casually remarked, “When we
are speaking to him in the
ordinary way now, are we to
address him as ‘Your Lord-
ship’?”
“You must decide that your-
self,” Lady Forrest laughingly
replied. “It’s easy for me.
I’ll still call him Jackie.”
Not long afterwards his
health began to cause con-
cern. I had noticed some
surgical-plaster strips on his
right temple. Casually meet-
ing one day popular Billy
(W. A.) Watt, one of the recog-
nised orators and phrase-
makers in the early days of the
Federal Parliament, I asked
what his colleague’s trouble
was. Billy pointed to his own
right temple with the enigmatic
remark, “This is the spot where
hurricanes are born.”
Baron Forrest was on his
way to London to seek medical
advice when he died suddenly
at sea. He had enjoyed his
W. A. Watt.

TACK ATTACK ON
KING O'MALLEY
Probably the most pic-
turesque and unorthodox
man who ever entered the
Federal Parliament was
King O’Malley. He came from
America. It was a matter of
deep regret, he said, that his
birth had taken place on the
Canadian border. If it had
been on the other side,, he
would have been eligible for
the Presidency of the United
States!
O’Malley was undoubtedly
an exhibitionist, but, at the
same time, he was a shrewd
businessman. In Canada he
had been a successful life-assu-
rance canvasser, and when he
came to Australia he appeared
to be fairly well off. He was
generous, too—no Parliamen-
tary colleague who needed a
little financial assistance for a
genuine purpose ever found
him unresponsive.
O’Malley never pretended
that he had made a fortune
at canvassing. He came to
Australia because he thought
it offered better propects than
Canada and would be good for
his health. The substantial
amount he stood possessed of
at his death was largely the
result of sound investments,
mostly in real-estate.
The trouble with O’Malley
was that he could put on such a
simple air that one never knew
whether he was pulling one's
leg or was really serious. Any-
way, that was his story about
the origin of his wealth.
He put another one over
me, and all I can say about
this one is that I referred to it
years aftewards, and he told
me the same thing in identical
terms.
We had been discussing
various forms of religion, and
he told me in a matter-of-fact
way that he was the founder
of a new church in America.
I had heard of many Gospel-
merchants who had set them-
selves up as Messiahs and had
hundreds of fanatical worship-
pers. It completely bowled me
over when he unsmilingly said
his church was “The Water
Lily Rock Bound Church of the
Red Skin Temple of the Sioux
Nation.”
I laughed, but he preserved
a most serious demeanor.
r pHE dignity of being a mem-
A ber of the Commonwealth
Parliament did not seem to
impress O'Malley at any time.
He was always ready for any
prank that would amuse mem-
bers and, incidentally, keep him
in the spotlight.
There was the time when he
entered the House of Represen-
tatives (then sitting in Mel-
bourne) dressed like a swag-
man, with his blankets
rolled-up and the customary
billycan hanging from them.
While members giggled, the
Speaker loudly called “Order!"
O’Malley knew this was
directed at him, and he said,
“Personal explanation, Mr.
Speaker.’’
But the austere Speaker, Sir
Frederick Holder, like a
Supreme Court Judge when a
barrister appears in the court
without his wig and gown,
refused to “see” the honorable
member, and the Sergeant-at-
Arms was about to perform the
unpleasant duty of escorting
the “stranger” from the
Chamber when O’Malley
reckoned the joke had gone
far enough. He picked up his
swag and disappeared through
a back door.
Afterwards O’Malley
explained to pressmen that, as
he could not find suitable and
convenient accommodation in
the city, he intended to ask
“Mr. Speaker” for permission to
erect his tent in the Parlia-
mentary gardens. This was
when he was Federal member
for Darwin, Tasmania.
Dour Scotch Andrew Fisher
would have none of O’Malley’s
exhibitionism. He regarded
him as a mountebank, but
other Labor members were pre-
pared to overlook any of his
little foibles and to credit him
with plenty of commonsense
and a natural aptitude for high
finance, as witness his personal
campaign for the establishment
of a Commonwealth Bank.
When Fisher was returned
to power in 1910 the Labor
caucus, as usual, balloted for
the members who were to form
the Ministry. Much to Fisher’s
surprise, the caucus included
O’Malley. Fisher allotted him
the portfolio of Minister for
Home Affairs.
O’Malley, who had never
let-up on his campaign for the
establishment of a Common-
wealth Bank, buttonholed
every member of the Labor
caucus, and his second triumph
came when the caucus decided
that the time had come for
giving effect to his proposals.
I think someone has recently
been romancing in connection
with the Labor-caucus approval
of O'Malley’s proposal to
establish the Commonwealth
Bank. It was said that the


scheme was approved by one
vote, and that O'Malley had
boasted that he had obtained
that vote by forging a letter
from an inebriated caucus-
member. This seems to be
too fantastic even for O’Malley
in his most irresponsible mood.
And to say that he boasted
of the trick is even more
unlikely.
O'Malley told me of many
things that happened in con-
nection with the establishment
of the bank, some of them
very confidential, but he never
even hinted at such a danger-
ous trick having had to be
resorted to. Moreover, there
were some members of the
Labor party who would not
have hesitated to use this “con-
fession” to dethrone “The
King,” whose unconventional
conduct they deplored.
In 1911 an Act was passed
to establish the bank. It was
not quite in the form that
O’Malley had planned, but he
was given the credit by Labor
members as having been the
founder.
Years later, when I was
financial-editor of the “Argus,”
I became a close friend of Sir
Robert Gibson, the chairman
of the Commonwealth Bank
Board. He told me that he
had a good deal of respect for
O’Malley’s financial ability.
He said O’Malley seemed to
have a natural instinct for
finance. His views, he said,
were often very soundly based,
although, at times, perhaps
somewhat unorthodox.
I do not believe, either, the
story that O’Malley had to
battle through the Labor
caucus, Cabinet and the
Federal Parliament the pro-
posal “to keep Western Aus-
tralia in the Federation” by
building the Transcontinental
Railway. It was always under-
stood that Sir John Forrest,
Premier for many years 'of
the western State, had brought
it into the Federation on a
definite promise fiom eastern
State Premiers that the East-
West line would be built. Sir
John Forrest never rested until
the first sod was turned at Port
Augusta by the Governor-
General, Lord Denman, on
September 14, 1912. O’Malley
was certainly Minister for
Home Affairs at the time, and
did everything in his power to
push on with the work of
construction.
'T'he principal staff-men in the
A Home Affairs Department
were four military officers.
O’Malley loved to refer to
them as his “gilt-spurred
roosters.” To his face they
treated him with respect, but
behind his back they threw up
their hands in a gesture of holy
horror at “having to put up
with a man like that.”
O’Malley used to turn-up
at his office, then in Russell
Street, promptly at the official
starting-time. He soon dis-
covered that some members of
the staff were habitually late.
He told me that he had made
a calculation of how much an
average loss of only 10
minutes a week by a certain
number of employees would
amount to in a year.
I have forgotten what the
total was, but it was sub-
stantial. He said, “You and
I, Brother, are paying for that
wasted time.” To rectify this
state of. affairs, he decided to
sign the book like other
employees, and then have a
red line drawn. All who arrived
late had to sign below the
red line and furnish an
explanation.
One morning when I called
to see the Minister in his
“The King ” (looked at by
Hal Gye).
Russell Street department in
the course of my daily round
I sensed an atmosphere of
somewhat restrained amuse-
ment. No one would tell me
what the joke was, so I poked
my nose into his room, expect-
ing to receive the usual cheery
“Come right in, Brother.” But
this time he remarked very
seriously, “You’re just the one
I want to see.”
Plainly O’Malley was very
angry—an unusual thing for
him —as he told me a story of
his chair having been sprinkled
with tacks, many with their
business-ends up. He said he
was going to have the depart-
ment turned inside-out until
the culprit was unearthed. He
was quite satisfied that one of
the senior officials was respon-
sible, or had connived at the
trick.
I am afraid that my news-
instinct outweighed my sym-
pathy, because I said I could
not resist having a go at it.
Horrified, he exclaimed
“No! No! It’s a graveyard,
Cook!” meaning that it must
be kept as a close secret until
the investigation was over.
I pointed out that the culprit
could easily be one of the very
junior clerks who resented
having to sign the attendance-
book under “the thin red line.”
I suggested that he was taking
a much too serious view of
the prank, but he indicated
very feelingly that when one’s
dignity had been deflated by
a tack, something drastic had
to be done about it.
That gave me an idea. Why
not treat the whole thing as a
joke and make it appear that
a tack had worked loose from
the upholstery and had got in
its deadly work in that way?
But O’Malley was hard to
convince, especially as he had
retrieved shme of the nice blue
unupholstered tacks and was
looking rather ruefully at them
on his desk.
So I made a bargain. “I’ll
write something that will take
the deliberate sting out of the
tacks,” I said, “and make a
bit of a joke out of it that will
preserve your dignity and cause
your colleagues to laugh, when
you go up to the House this
afternoon.”
' O’Malley had a happy dis-
position. In an air of almost
childlike simplicity he asked,
“Do you really think it
would?”
“Of course,” I readily replied.
“Wouldn’t that be better than
to allow the incident to remain
as a deliberate scheme to be-
little you? That would do you
no good personally or
politically.”
Ultimately he agreed, and
I said I would let him read my
stuff before I sent it to the
office.
When I showed O’Malley
what I had written, he seemed
very pleased at the way I had
twisted around his experience.
“Right,” he said. “Give it
a go.”
Here is the item as it
appeared in the Melbourne
“Herald”: —
MR. O'MALLEY'S
MISFORTUNE
REALISTIC WAR DANCE
Last week Mr. O’Malley amused
Parliament by. stating that he and
his principal officers had had a
“war dance” over some depart-
mental matters that had been
delayed. This week the Minister
executed a more exciting and
realistic calisthenic movement. He
sat on a tack.
Nobody in the Home Affairs
Department this afternoon would
talk about tacks. They said they
were a “sore point” with the
Minister. Mr. O’Malley was also
reticent. In that respect he was
unlike the tack. Its remark was
very pointed, and the Minister had
a painful recollection of it.
Mr. O’Malley was not doing his
departmental work on the mantel-
piece when seen today. He sat in
his chair as if at ease. But that .
was only what he himself would
have described as “his great
Christian fortitude.”
How the tack got onto the
Minister’s chair is easily explained.
It was one of those chairs with a
leather border fastened down with
the kind of covered tack from which
“Get-rich-quick-Wallingford” made
his fortune. One of the tacks had
worked loose, and as the Minister
sat down, it was rolled over until
the business-end made its presence
felt.
The Christmas Day storm is said
to have been a mere fireworks
display to the disturbance that
raged for a few moments in the
precincts of the Minister.
“There is only one difference
between a tack and a rattlesnake,”
said Mr. O’Malley, “and that is
that a tack gets in its deadly work
without making any noise. It leaves
you to make the noise afterwards.”
It will be seen that I had
to pervert the facts a bit in
order to save the Minister from
a very delicate situation, but
I felt justified in doing this,
especially as Colonel Miller, the
Secretary to the Home Affairs
Department, was worried about
the investigation the Minister
had ordered him to carry out.
The way in which O’Malley’s
colleagues enjoyed the joke at
the House suited his tempera-
ment, however, and he no
longer treated the incident
seriously.
Apparently the editor, Guy
Innes (who had succeeded Col.
W. T. Reay), was also tickled,
as he jokingly went through
the formula of having a special
proof of the cross-head pulled
on highly calendered paper,
and endorsing it “Presentation
Copy for the Author, with the
compliments of Guy Innes.”
ON one occasion when
O’Malley was visiting my
home we sat in front of the fire
frankly discussing Fisher’s
objections to certain details in
O’Malley’s banking-scheme.

"JACKSUL,” BRISBANE
My eldest daughter, Sylvia,
then very young, was busy at
a table nearby doing her
school - lessons, which we
thought were engaging her
whole attention. Suddenly she
broke into the conversation to
ask a question bearing on the
subject—and a very appro-
priate question, too.
O'Malley stopped abruptly
as if he had been struck. It
was the first time in my life
that he appeared to me to have
a scared look.
“Will she blab?” he whis-
pered anxiously to me.
I soon reassured him on that
point.
O’Malley’s character was a
strange mixture of self-
confidence, cuteness and bold-
ness, yet with a vein of
timidity.
No one could accuse
O’Malley of ever hiding his
light under a bushel. He
.loved publicity. When he
became Minister for Home
Affairs he decided that he
would show his appreciation of
members of the Labor party,
who had elevated him to
Cabinet rank, by keeping them
informed of the work on which
. his department was engaged.
He felt that all members
were entitled to know about
the small things in their con-
stituencies that Ministers were
.doing, but which had no
interest to the general public.
For instance, a telegraph-line
to connect Woop Woop could
be of vital importance to the
local residents, but no one else
would care a rap about it. To
remedy this state of affairs,
O'Malley decided on an inno-
vation. It was the collation of
the activities of the several
departments in the form of a
schedule called “A Works
Digest.” The first few issues
were mostly devoted to the
progressive stages reached in
the construction of Federal
public works throughout the
Commonwealth.
The highlight was reached in
Schedule No. 14. Running to
370 pages, it was prefaced with
this elegant notification:
This publication. No. 14, is dedi-
cated to tlie Federation of the
English-speaking Peoples into one
world-wide cause, with one uni-
versal hope and destiny.
A feature was the reproduc-
' tion of eight pages of letters
from eminent men all over
the world, to whom O’Malley
had sent copies of previous
Schedules. One from Theo-
dore Roosevelt was interesting.
He said that nothing would
give him greater pleasure than
to visit Australia, whose
people had been “pioneers
along many paths of social and
industrial reform.” But he
never managed to make the
trip.
Other appreciative acknow-
ledgements came from the
Governor of Alaska ; Secretary
of State for U.S.A. ; Post-
master-General of .Canada ;
Secretary ©f State of Dela-
ware ; Solicitor-General of
Dublin, and so on —eight pages
of them.
In this edition he also repro-
duced 36 pages of photographs
of “distinguished statesmen”
of Great Britain, United States
of America, Canada, South
Africa and New Zealand;
Josiah Thomas (also seen
by Hal Gye).
Chief Justices of Australia;
Ministers and members of the
Commonwealth Parliament,
and, breathe it gently, two
pages of photographs of
journalists who did the
Federal Parliamentary and
departmental rounds in the
first 13 years of Federation.
An elaborately produced
volume was also issued by
O’Malley to distinguished
citizens at home and abroad,
commemorating the laying of
the foundation-stones and the
naming of the Federal City,
Canberra. At the Minister’s
request, I “ghosted” the intro-
ductory page which appeared
over the flamboyant signature
“King O’Malley.” This sig-
nature could be described as
a regal thing of beauty and a
joy for ever. At the head of
this introduction, I quoted an
appropriate verse from
Tennyson:—
We sail’d wherever ship could sail,
We founded many a mighty State;
Pray God our greatness may not
fail
Thro’ craven fears of being great.
“Brother, that’s good,” com-
mented O’Malley.
Like Hughes, O’Malley
suffered from periodical diges-
tive troubles. He was never
a good trencherman,, and was
always at a loss to account
for his indispositions. He did
not like taking medicines. His
cure was to go on a fortnight’s
fast. Some senior members
of the staff used to refer to
them feelingly as his “halitus
days.”
I was dubious about the
truth of these lengthy absten-
tions from food, because he
continued to be very active
about his work, but I was
assured by his wife, formerly
Amy Horton, well known to
my wife and myself many
years before she married
O’Malley, that they were
genuine. All he did was to
drink water.
These fasting periods appar-
ently relieved his ailments,
because when he died in
December, 1953, his age was
given as 99. The press-notices
also confounded critics who
had scoffed at his financial
ability. They disclosed that
he had left an estate bordering
on £70,000, a large portion
being in real-estate and
Commonwealth bonds.
JOSIAH TAKES ACTION
Under the clause of the
Post and Telegraph Act,
1901, prohibiting the
transmission or delivery
of letters or other articles of an
undesirable or unlawful nature,
one of the earliest addresses
to come under the ban was
Tattersall's (Geo. Adams), then
established in Tasmania. But
the gambling spirit was rife,
and the law became almost a
dead-letter. Numerous persons
under various disguises set
themselves up in Tasmania as
agents of Tattersall’s with the
connivance of the controllers
of the great sweeps. '
When Senator Josiah Thomas
became Postmaster-General in
the first Fisher Ministry (1908-
1909) the mail from Australia
to Tasmania had assumed pro-
portions far beyond the require-
ments of legitimate business.
Unmolested agents by this
time were doing so well that
increasing numbers of others
were setting themselves up to
partake of the feast of com-
missions.
Josiah was a good church-
man. Before entering political
life he was a local preacher.
He was a cheerful, breezy soul,
never subscribing to the notion
that a religious man must
necessarily be dull and solemn.
I caught him quietly laugh-
ing one day when I barged
my way into his room in
Spring Street, Melbourne, in
the free-and-easy way some of
us had with Ministers of the
Crown in the first decade or
two.
I asked him what the joke
was.
He said that something he
was contemplating doing
reminded him of' a passage in
Isaiah: “And I will turn my
hand upon thee and purely
purge away thy dross and take
away all thy tin.”
He smilingly added that he
was going to take away some
of the “tin” of the Tattersall-
agents. He had satisfactory evi-
dence of names and addresses
of a large number of persons
who were acting as agents for
Tattersall’s. These were to be
published in the next issue of
the “Commonwealth Govern-
ment Gazette.”
It was a first-rate bit of

“Six Tears in Support”
IN his recent book of reminiscences
Sir William Slim confessed having
once looked-up in the British Official
War History an account of a little
scrap he himself was engaged in during
World War I and having been a little
disappointed at finding it dismissed in
a few words. This is an experience
thousands of less distinguished soldiers
have shared with the Governor-General,
and although most of them would agree
that the official historian should concen-
trate on a broad picture of actions and
campaigns there are probably few who
have not felt that their own little show
might have been given a little more
space without detriment to the general
picture.
The task of filling-in the details
belongs to the men who write the unit
war-histories —the stories of individual
battalions and regiments. Usually these
are written by former unit-members who
have had access to war-diaries and
official records, and have been able to
check with other ex-members their own
recollections of places and events. Many
of these unit-histories have been pub-
lished in the last few years and,
while their special appeal is to
former members of particular units,
the best of them, especially when
the author avoids the temptation
of filling his chapters with anecdotes
and dragging into the text every man-
jack in the battalion, preferably by nick-
name, form a valuable contribution to
the literature of the war.
Latest of these volumes is Six Years
in Support, by Major E. V. Haywood,
M.C., (Angus and Robertson), which is
the official history of 2/1st Australian
Field Regiment. The Second /First, which
inherited the colors and traditions of
the 1st Brigade Artillery of the Kaiser’s
war, regarded itself as the senior regi-
ment of the 2nd A.I.F. It was raised
at Ingleburn in October, 1939, and by
the war’s end had trailed its guns from
Bardia to Benghazi; in Greece ; at Buna,
Gona and Sanananda ; at Wau ; and
from Aitape to Wewak.
Beginnings
T ieut.-Col. L. C. Kelly was first
C.O. of the regiment; Major K. E.
O Connell and Capt. C. N. Peters his
two battery commanders. Most of the
men who comprised the “originals”
came straight from the recruiting-
depots, but there was a fair leavening
of ex-C.M.F. men. The regiment sailed
from Sydney with the 10-ship convoy
of the Sixth Division on Janbary 7,
1940, and a month later found itself
in Palestine amid placenames made
famous in Australian history by the
First A.I.F. Training and garrison-
duty, service in the anti-aircraft defence
of Haifa and (later) of Aboukir and
Sidi Bisr in Egypt occupied most of
1940, but when, late in November, the
unit was suddenly equipped with its
first 25-pounders, the gunners began to
hope that they were soon to be used
in their proper role of field artillery.
They were right. On the day before
Christmas No. 1 gun, A-troop, 1st
Battery, fired the regiment’s first shot
against the Italians, a little to the north
of Fort Capuzzo, just inside Cyrenaica.
By this time command of the regiment
had passed to Lieut.-Col. L. E. S. Barker,
of whom Haywood writes: —
Six feet plus in height, he was built in
proportion. His courage had been tested
in the First World War and he wore the
ribbon of the Military Cross to show the
result. Keen blue eyes, set in a large
angular face, bored through all disguises
and subterfuges with an unblinking gaze,
and an alert mind reacted with orisp,
unmistakable orders and flourishing gestures
with large expressive hands.
Victory in North Africa
"Darker’s fetish was physical fitness
** and his favorite method of ensuring
it for the regiment was to double all
hands across the desert in search of the
horizon. Everybody cursed him for it,
but it paid-off when the big test came
in the desert.
Bardia was the regiment’s real baptism
of fire. It was also the beginning of
the Sixth Division’s victorious swoop
across Cyrenaica. The capture of
Bardia is an oft-told tale. Not so well-
known is the story of the capture of
an entire Italian battery by a 2/1st
Regiment officer. This was Capt. Norm
Vickery, who was acting as Forward
Observation Officer with the 2/11th
Battalion. His Bren-gun carrier became
detached from the infantry and he came
unexpectedly behind the enemy battery.
Regardless of his solitary state, he charged
the battery with his carrier. Believing him
to be the vanguard of an armored assault,
the enemy surrendered. When no other
tanks or troops appeared behind him, the
Italian officers tried to spur the remainder
to fight, but a few rounds from the carrier
countered the attempt and the entire garri-
son started off on their long trip to the
prisoner-of-war cages.
From Bardia, on to Tobruk, Barce,
Derna, Benghazi and El Agheila!
Defeat in Greece
Tt is ironical that so soon after tasting
the fruits of victory in North Africa,
the regiment was to suffer the bitterness
of defeat in Greece. On March 22,
1941, the regiment reached Mersa
Matruh after its long trek back from
Benghazi. Three weeks later R.H.Q.
and 1 Battery disembarked at Piraeus,
the port of Athens, and set off by rail
for Larisa in what appeared to be the
only train going in that direction and
which had virtually to force its way
against a stream of south-bound hospital-
and refugee-trains. Its guns had been
loaded on another ship and were pre-
sumably to meet them at Larisa.
Before Larisa was reached the C.O.
was informed that the Greek train-crew
had had no relief for 36 hours, considered
that they were going the wrong way, and,
in the words of the informant, “were
completely browned-off, had had it, and
were shooting through.”
Amateur drivers and firemen from the
regiment took charge and the train
arrived in Larisa 100 per cent. Aus-
tralian. No guns or vehicles there and
no news that wasn’t thoroughly bad!
Meanwhile, the gun-party had landed at
Volos, where Corps H.Q. gave the “con-
voy of guns without gunners” an austere
greeting and sent them off in search
of their regiment “in much the same
manner as a soldier is sent off parade
to get himself properly dressed.” For
the next couple of days, while refugees
streamed south and German dive-
bombers softened -up the countryside
for the tanks and troops that weren’t
far behind, the regiment, in its private
train, to which had been added many
truckloads of refugees, headed south
again looking for its guns while the
gun-party threaded its way along
refugee-crowded roads looking for the
regiment. The situation apparently
epitomises the Greek campaign.
Reunion at Domokis. Thereafter,
rearguard actions covering the with-
drawal of the main formations of Aus-
tralian troops, culminating in evacuation
from the beach at Kalamata. For those
fortunate enough to be taken-off the
total duration of the Grecian adventure
was 14 days; for the 64 officers and
men who were not so lucky, it meant
over three years in German prison-
camps.
New Guinea
Tf the confusion of defeat in Greece was
a contrast to the victory in North
Africa a contrast of a different kind
lay ahead of the regiment in New
Guinea, where it next saw action,
towards the end of 1942. Flown with
its guns across the Owen Stanley Range
from Port Moresby the first Aus-
tralian artillery to take to the air—the
regiment’s 51st Battery played an im-
portant part in the destruction of the
Jap forces in the Buna-Gona area.
Jungle-warfare called for new techniques,
vastly different from those learned in
the rapid-movement campaigns of the
Middle East. In addition to the Japs
there was another new enemy to con-
tend with—malaria, which took a heavy
toll, especially in the early stages of
the Pacific War.
As the Buna show drew to a close
Ist Battery was given a little job of its
own. In response to an SOS from
17th Brigade, it was airlifted to Wau,
which was strongly threatened by a Jap
force. A-troop had to assemble its
guns on the airstrip, which was already
under fire, and get them into action
quick-smart. When the attack was re-
pelled and the Australian grip on Wau
confirmed, the gunners had the satisfac-
tory feeling of having arrived (for once)
in the nick of time.
The regiment had two tours of duty
in New Guinea, the second in 1945,
when, reunited with Sixth Division, it
landed at Aitape and took part in the
advance to and capture of Wewak. It
was still operating in that area when
the war ended.

The Canada
Ampol and the International
Golf Association made a
splendid job of staging the
Canada Cup at Royal Mel-
bourne last week, and, by the
same token, the Australian
pair, Peter Thomson and Kel
Nagle, made a fair job of
Dedicated to the notion that
golf might prove at least as
good a medium for the pro-
motion of international good-
will as some of the other more
heavily subsidised lines of
approach, the Canada Cup was
instituted in June, 1953, the
prime-mover being an inter-
national lawyer, financier and
general “big dealer” named
John Jay Hopkins.
The first playing of the
“International Teams Matches
for the Canada Cup” didn’t
attract a great deal of interest
*—or competition. It was con-
tested by 14 players represent-
ing seven countries. They went
through two rounds of medal
play at Beaconsfield course in
Montreal, Canada, an Argen-
tinian pair winning.
Since then the status of the
event has grown steadily. The
1954 winner was Australia,
represented, in anticipation of
coming events, by Peter Thom-
son and Kel Nagle. Then fol-
lowed U.S.A. (in 1955 and
’56), Japan and Ireland.
The 1959 Canada Cup,
exceptionally well organised
and well staged as it was,
might contribute a lot to
establishing the event as the
“Davis Cup” of golf. The field
comprised two-man teams
from 30 countries; they are
worth listing: Australia,
U.S.A., Canada, South Africa,
England, Wales, Scotland,
China, Argentina, Belgium,
Ireland, Japan, France, Italy,
Brazil, New Zealand, Chile,
Mexico, Colombia, Egypt,
Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark,
Germany, Portugal, Philip-
pines, Holland, Korea, Indo-
nesia (listed in the order in
Much they finished).
A Turf cliche “He went to
the front and stayed there,”
amply describes the play.
Thomson and Nagle were
seven-up after the first round ;
they were still there after the
second and third rounds. At
one stage of the final round
they were a baker’s dozen in
front, and when cards were
counted finally they won by
10 strokes. For the first three
rounds the Canadian team of
Leonard and Balding were
runners-up, but in the final
round the Americans Snead
and Middlecoff crept one stroke
in front of the Canadians.
Canadian S. Leonard won
the individual championship,
tying with Peter Thomson
over the four rounds, and then
winning the “sudden-death”
play-off, at the first hole, by one
stroke —which is certainly
sudden death.
For the record, Peter Thom-
son's rounds were: 67, 69, 68,
and 71: Nagle’s, 70, 70, 76,
72. The total 263 against U.S.A.
273, made up of Snead 73, 65,
73, 70, and Middlecoff 72, 75,
75, 70. Leonard, of Canada,
registered 70, 66, 69, 70 for
his 275.
On Sunday Thomson and
Nagle showed it was no fluke
by beating Snead and Middle-
coff by 11 strokes in a 36-hole
fourball aggregate at the Aus-
tralian Club, 289-300.
“Nineteenth”: No doubt about
it, the Ampol tourney at Sydney’s
Kensington was a wonderful prelude
to the Canada Cup —few tourna-
ments in Australia have got near
to equalling it for excitement over
the concluding stages. Peter
Thomson, playing superbly,
appeared to have it won, but a
quick patch of errors at the 10th,
11th and 12th ruined his chance.
He knew it, too, with Player and
Nagle following him. Those
familiar with the fine points of
golf then saw two men stage a
“nerve”-war as each matched the
other in wood-, iron- and putting-
play. Both felt the strain, and each
was astray, but, curiously, always
at the same hole. Player jumped
to the lead at the 11th, but Nagle
equalled him two holes later. Both
dropped a stroke at the 15th, which
meant they had to get a birdie
to beat Thomson, who was watching
from the clubhouse. In those last
three holes there were two chances
for them —at the 16th and 18th;
holes recognised as being reason-
ably easy for top-class professionals.
Each of them got a birdie at the
16th, to again share the lead. All
depended then on the par-5 18th,
and Player was the one who had
the chance to win. He had only
to drop a five-foot putt, but the
ball curled the lip and stayed out,
and both men shared the first and
second prize, worth £6OO to each.

Sydney Horses
Queensland grazier G. A.
Warby, who generally has a
horse or two with Rosehill
trainer Tom Kennedy, has
been a long time in racing,
and his colors —green, black
diamond, black sleeves, green
cap—are familiar on Sydney
tracks. Kennedy has, in fact,
trained no fewer than 53
winners for him, the latest of
them Coomrith Star, stylish
winner of last Saturday’s
Juvenile Maiden for colts and
geldings at Warwick Farm.
The colt, who cost 3300gn5.,
followed Gemini Prince into
the ring at the Randwick
yearling-auction last Easter,
and Gemini Prince also won
at Warwick a week earlier.
They were bred by Fairways
Stud, Muswellbrook (N.S.W.).
Coomrith Star is a good-
looking Star Kingdom (imp.)
colt from Alcestis by Manitoba
(imp.) from Miss Eastern by
Chivalrous (imp.). Alcestis,
closely related to Unity—dam
of Melbourne Cup winner
Baystone, who was recently
retired —has thrown several
winners, including Brisbane
gallopers Thessaly Star, King’s
Realm and Staratom, and
Sydney winners Admetus and
Hindostan, and, as well, one of
her progeny, Allsor, won a
dozen races in Japan.
• • • •
It was unusual for the A.J.C.
to provide for six emergencies
for each division of the Two-
year-old Maiden at the Farm ;
done to give connections a
chance of their entries getting
a run in the event of scratch-
ings after acceptance-hour. As
the two winners, Coomrith Star
and Santana, were emergencies
the respective owners were in
luck’s way, particularly Mes-
dames E. B. Walker and J.
Daniels, who race Santana, a
filly by Newtown Wonder
(imp.) from Miss Chatterbox.
She was fifth reserve! Show-
ing the usual Newtown Wonder
speed, she lasted long enough
to beat Floribunda a long
neck, with Snow Gleam a neck
away third. Jack Daniels trains
the filly at Rosehill.

M. Schumacher’s experience
and hard riding won the 11-fur-
longs Farm Novice on Jose, a
five-year-old Berrylands (imp.)
gelding whose dam, Quest,

King Ingoda, 1922 Melbourne
Cup winner, and Corinax, a
New Zealand Cup winner, so

Jose could be a prospect for
the Summer Cup, in which he’ll
get a light weight.

Plymouth, from the T. J.
Smith stable, completed a
double for Schumacher. Raced
by Mrs. Tom Powell, Plymouth
came with a late run, and was
going away from them at the.
finish of the Farm Highweight.

Nadar Shah’s four runs
prior to winning the Farm
Encourage were at 10 furlongs,
but the four-year-old gelding
came back to Saturday’s mile
distance, to land the money
in fine style. Actually, trainer
Jack Green’s tactics did the
trick, his riding-instructions to
R. Williams proving exactly
right. Williams was told to
ride the horse differently, let-
ting him drop out in the early
part—and to be on the safe
side, in case it didn’t work-out,
Green took the unusual step
of telling steward Jack Bourke
of the plan beforehand. In
the event, the plan couldn’t
have worked better.
Apprentice Hilton Trenear
and four-year-old Winchester
are a successful combination:
the lad has had five rides on the
sprinter for four wins and a
third. Owner C. K. Urquhart
has been the main force
behind the wins; he was so
pleased with the lad’s first
success on the horse at Rand-
wick on October 5 that he kept
him on. The Camden Handicap
win was Winchester's best to
date; he did nearly all the
pacemaking and was able to
stall-off a last-ditch challenge
from the lighter-weighted
Merry Amber, with favorite
Great Blaze third.
With three wins from his

last four starts, Yarrawin,
from Frank Dalton’s Randwick
stable, has reached peak form,
and this much - improved
middle-distance galloper could
take a hand in the important
summer handicaps ahead at
Randwick. A younger brother
of dual (1956) Derby winner
Monte Carlo, he’s bred to
stay any distance, and is cer-
tainly one to watch.

Travel Boy duly won the
Queensland Derby, going easily
to the line six lengths clear of
the local Countwood, with
Natale (also a local) third.
Time, 2.33.8.
An “aged” horse, Dream
King, won the two-mile
Queensland Cup, with another
of the “aged,” Torrock, in
third place, and a six-year-old,
Prince Marco, taking second
money. It was a moderate
field for such a rich race, and
Dream King won easily in
average time (3.21). Prince
Marco also finished second in
last year’s Cup, while Torrock
was second to General Fox
in 1956. The winner is by
Rimveil (sire of dozens of
Queensland winners) from
Dreaming Lady by Excitement
(imp.) from Sinair by Air
Balloon (imp.).
“Meg”: Add to the list of
unusual race-accidents a recent
fall at Doomben. According to
evidence at the subsequent
inquiry, the filly Hortense over-
balanced and fell when pigeons
flew up in front of her!

At Caulfield
When it was first run in
1924 the Eclipse Stakes —last
of the big spring handicaps in
Melbourne —was known as the
Consolation Stakes, and Satur-
day’s result was certainly a
pleasant consolation for the
connections of Dawdie (as was
said here last week, she would
certainly have won the
Williamstown Cup had her
saddle not slipped at the half-
mile). On Saturday she
enjoyed a perfect run all the
way, and in the straight was
untroubled to score easily. It
was a Westralian success all
round. Dawdie is owned there
by studmaster J. G. Money;
she was prepared for Satur-
day’s race by former Perth
trainer Angus Armanasco
(now settled in Melbourne),
and was ridden by Frank
Treen, who began his career
in Perth.
There is no doubt about the
class of The Penciller, who
won his fourth successive race
inside 24 days when he cleared
away with the first heat of the
five-furlongs Stansmore Two-
year-old. Adelaide filly Coro-
nation Belle —undefeated in
two starts, winning the second
by seven lengths—was well
backed and showed unusual
speed to lead three-lengths at
the three, but in the run home
The Penciller picked her up
easily. He’s a chestnut gelding
by Newtown Wonder from
Fairystream (who did not
race) by Midstream from
Goosey Gander by The Night
Patrol from Jay Walker.
Undoubtedly The Penciller,
who carried 9.2, is the best
two-year-old in Melbourne,
and anything that can beat
him will have to be right out
of the ordinary.
Aly Khan deserved to win
the second Stansmore. The
New Zealand-bred colt had
started twice before in Mel-
bourne for seconds to top-class
youngsters, Hydrell and The
Penciller. He is a very speedy
sort, and in the weak class
he met on Saturday he won
on the bit.
Trained by Adelaide mentor
Ambrose Little (who also has
Coronation Belle), Makalot
showed too much pace for the
sprinters in the six-furlongs
Rosstown Plate. Makalot is
a four-year-old mare by
Makarpura from Princess
Esther, and has excellent form
in Adelaide. Little brought her
to Melbourne because he
thought the Adelaide handi-
cappers had too high an
opinion of the mare, and he
intends to leave her in Vic-
toria for sprints over the
summer months. She should
win again ; her effort on
Saturday to start from the out-
side of the big field and burn-
off all opposition was
impressive.

ance in success or failure, and
he maintained his usual phleg-
matic air as he came back to

indifferent to the nasty demon-
stration that had erupted all
over the course. Anonyme,
who had broken 1.10 for six
furlongs at the same course
on the previous Saturday, was
a very warm favorite for the
Pelham Handicap. The colt
missed the start and, burdened
with 9.10, had to be"shepherded
through the.big field. The task
was too much, but he did beat
all but La Joseph.ina, and she’s
a very good filly, worth fol-
lowing over the summer
months.

The Trots
After failing many times
through breaking in running,
Queen Bee trotted faultlessly
and duly landed the Trotters’
Handicap at Harold Park on
Saturday night. Lucky Vale
trailed her all the way after
the first lap, but was no match
for her. In the First Qualify-
ing Stakes Noble Dixie beat
.Victory Scott by a half-head
after sustaining a protest on
the grounds of interference.
The pair singled-out in the
straight and fought it out
right to the post. Driver Alf
Phillis’s tactics paid dividends
when he drove Rosslawn hard
to take the lead early in the
Harold Park Handicap (11|
furlongs), holding the lead to
defeat Field Dixie and favorite
Kerryfield. At the previous
Monday night’s postponed
meeting Phillis, using similar
tactics, had landed Rosslawn
a very easy winner in the
Dundas Handicap. Odds-on
favorite Eden Monaro had to
fight hard to get the decision
by a neck from Amazing Vale
in the Revesby Handicap,
another of the thrillers in
Saturday night’s first-rate pro-
gramme.

Tennis Titles
With a longer gap than
usual between Davis Cup play-
offs —due to the trophy switch-
ing from Northern to Southern
Hemisphere at short notice —
the L.T.A.A. has a bevy of
girl importations touring the
Australian tournament-circuit
this season in place of the
more customary blokes. It has
been rewarded by bringing
forth an exceptionally promis-
ing bit of local material —Jan
Lehane, who, at 18 years, has
so far this season beaten all
the local top-seeds, plus the
three importations.
Jan hails from Grenfell
(N.S.W.), and, like a great
many of the promising ones
threatening their elders in
N.S.W., she is a product of
the very fine junior coaching-
programme run by the
N.S.W.L.T.A.
In the Queensland cham-
pionships Miss Lehane
accounted for Christine Tru-
man, of Britain, who is ranked
No. 2 in the world on the
strength of last. Wimbledon
results. In the N.S.W. titles
Miss Truman was eliminated
early. Jan Lehane, in her half
of the draw, accounted for,
firstly, the American girl Mimi
Arnold ; then, in a semi-final,
the Wimbledon and U.S.-title
winner Maria Bueno ; and, in
the final, Mrs. Reitano (the
former Mary Carter).
The N.S.W. men’s singles
title went to Neale Fraser,
reversing recent defeats by
Roy Emerson, 11-9, 8-6, 6-3.
In the men’s doubles, against
all form indications, Bob
Hewitt and Bob Howe downed
the Davis Cup pair Fraser and
Emerson 6-4, 6-8, 10-8, 4-6,
6-2. Bad light stopped play
in the mixed doubles, with
Howe and Maria Bueno v.
Bob Mark and Mrs. Reitano
6-4, 9-11, 7-all; they’ll finish
it at the Victorian champion-
ships.

Cricket Comment
The first 1959-60 cricket
Test between Australia and
Pakistan, played at Dacca, was
won comfortably enough by
Australia by eight wickets —
the same margin by which Aus-
tralia defeated England in the
first two Tests last season.
After dismissing Pakistan for the
round 200, the Australians had to
battle for a first-innings lead, and
two men were mainly responsible
that they achieved it —Harvey, with
a fighting 96, and ’keeper Grout,
with a typical hard-hitting Grout
knock of 66 not-out.
Mackay (45 overs) and Benaud
(39.3 overs) did practically all the
bowling in dismissing Pakistan again
for 134. Mackay’s 6-42 was his
best bowling-effort in Test-oricket.
Benaud took four wickets in each
innings.
In Australia’s second innings
McDonald, Harvey and O’Neill all
batted freely. A Pakistan batsman
to impress was young Anglo-Indian
Duncan Sharpe, who made 56
(run-out) and 35 in his first Test.
Pakistan 200 (Hanif Mohammad
66, Sharpe 56; Davidson 4-42,
Benaud 4-69) and 134 (Mackay
6-42, Benaud 4-42). Australia 225
(Harvey 96, Grout 66 not-out;
Fazal Mahmood 5-70) and 2-112
(McDonald 44 not-out).
“K.R.”: Hanif Mohammad,
diminutive Pakistan Test-opener,
was, at 17 years 10 months, one
of the half-dozen youngest to play
in their first Test (v. India at
Delhi in 1952). He holds two world
batting-records. He has played the
longest Test (or any) innings—
16hrs. 3min. in making 337 in the
first Pakistan v. West Indies Test
at Bridgetown in January, 1958 ;
the previous endurance record was
Hutton’s 13hrs. 20min. in his 364
for England v. Australia in 1938.
Hanif has also made the highest
first-class score, 499 run-out (off the
last ball of the day)—for Karachi v.
Bahawalpur in January this year.
Previous highest score was Brad-
man’s 452 not-out v. Queensland
in 1929-30. While Hanif undoubt-
edly must have a lot, I doubt if
anyone would claim that either of
his record-breaking feats was as
meritorious as the two he beat,
“Veryl”: In B. 11/11/’59 I
wrote about a problem arising out
of a Melbourne junior cricket-
match when one team fielded 12
men for a time. Another ticklish
point arose in another junior game
in Melbourne soon after. The team
batting second in this game passed
its opponents by one run (184 to
183) in the last over of the match;
but, when the score-books were
checked, though both batting-tallies
added-up to 184, both sets of
bowlers’ figures made only 183. The
V.C.A. Pennant Committee eventu-
ally ruled that the batting-figures
must stand as the correct score,
the bowling-figures not being a
record of the batsmen’s scores.
The second team thus won by one
run. Undoubtedly this was the
most sensible ruling possible.
“Bob Ray”: Selected cap-
tain of Queensland’s Sheffield
Shield side against N.S.W. at
Brisbane, Jim Bratchford has
packed 45 games into his seven
years of Shield cricket, taking
97 wickets and scoring 1299
runs. His good form for
Benaud’s side against Lind-
wall’s in the Queensland
Centenary Year match clinched
his selection.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
BRITAIN AND THE DETERRENT
Tn a lengthy article in the
■*- British monthly “Contem-
porary Review,” Lieut.-Colonel
Patrick Lort-Phillips, D. 5.0.,
supports the case for a change
in Britain’s policy on nuclear
defence:
“So far we [Britain] have
acted on the assumption that
we are still a great military
Power, able to intervene
decisively in world problems,
to fight major wars, to police
the seas and the under-
developed areas of the world,
to intervene with armed force
in Asia and Africa, and gener-
ally to behave as though we
were still masters of our own
destiny.
“But of course we are not.
For Britain the issue is clear.
Either we are partners —
genuine partners in a greater
unity—or we remain a
sovereign Power of ever-
diminishing importance and
consequence in world affairs.
Both paths have their advant-
ages and their disadvantages,
but a choice cannot be delayed
much longer. If we claim the
rights of sovereignty in a
nuclear world we will find our-
selves pressed increasingly ill
the direction of neutrality. A
sovereign State of 50-million
people cannot indefinitely
throw its weight about among
nations numbering hundreds of
millions, especially now that
Western technology is becom-
ing available to all. From now
on numbers are going to be
decisive.
“In the 19th century numbers
meant little. A handful of Red-
coats with a Maxim-gun were
more than a match for a horde
of spear-throwing savages. But
when all are armed with
modern weapons, numbers do
count; and in a very few years
numbers will be decisive.
Britain can never be a great
military Power on her own.
The Suez campaign marked the
turning-point. As an indepen-
dent military Power we shall be
forced in the end into a policy
of neutrality on the lines of
Sweden or Switzerland. But
as a partner in a greater unity
we can still play an important
part in world affairs.
“A truly united Europe could
be a great Power. A truly
united North Atlantic Com-
munity could be the greatest
Power in the World for genera-
tions to come. But all these
unities must be genuine unities,
united politically and economi-
cally as well as militarily, if
they are to be effective. A
loose alliance of sovereign
States cannot stand up to the
stresses of modern power-
politics and nuclear blackmail.
The failure of Nato is plain
for all to see. This laboriously
constructed edifice is crumb-
ling before our eyes under the
impact of French and British
nuclear nationalism.
“Will a sovereign Britain or
France risk extermination for
—London “Evening Standard.”
“LADY, BY YONDER BLESSED MOON I SWEAR...”
(“Romeo and Juliet,” Act II, Scene 2.)
Germany? Will a sovereign
U.S. risk extermination for
France or Britain? I doubt it.
And this is not to impute bad
faith to our political leaders.
The statesmen of the West are
legally and morally responsible
to their own electorate for the
decisions they have to make.
They cannot be expected to
opt for suicide on behalf of
other nations and people.
“But •if Britain accepts
partnership in a greater unify,
as I believe we must, we shall
be junior partners, bound to
accept majority decisions, with
all the consequences which
that implies. It is to avoid
this dilemma that so many
people in Britain today cling
so desperately to the hope of
a British nuclear deterrent. If
only, they say, we can have
our own bomb, we can remain
masters of our own destiny.
But the hope is vain.
“The safety of Britain no
longer lies in unilateral military
preparations. In fact, it does
not lie in military preparations
at all. Out of the turmoil of
emotions and wishful think-
ing which engulfs our attitude
to defence today, these facts
stand out a mile.
“Britain has nothing to gain
in any way whatsoever by
arming herself with nuclear
weapons. And this is a prac-
tical conclusion divorced from
all moral and ethical considera-
tions. In nuclear war they
ensure suicide ; as a deterrent
against total war they are not
credible; and as an aid to
our diplomacy in lesser matters
they impress neither friend nor
foe. The decision, taken today,
to stop the manufacture and
testing of weapons would be a
positive and refreshing contri-
bution to reality—and a great
relief to our economy.”
Commenting on Lieut.-
Colonel Lort-Phillips’s argu-
ment in the same publication,
H. S. Deighton, of Oxford
University, holds that the sup-
porters of present British
policy, while agreeing that a
nuclear war would probably
mean world destruction, are
just as much concerned to pre-
vent such a war and the spread
of nuclear arms as those who
advocate that Britain should
renounce the deterrent.
“The difference,” he writes,
“is not one of purpose but of
method.” And he firmly rejects
the argument that possession
of the deterrent is a drawback
to pursuit of this purpose:
“The more logical view
would surely be that if it is a
principal object of British
policy to bring about the end
of military-nuclear expansion
and to subject all such power
to effective international super-
vision, as it certainly ought to
be, the possession of the
nuclear weapon has given, and
its continued possession will
continue to give, a better
chance of attaining those ends.
“The evidence for this is
perfectly plain. Two things are
essential for the formation and
implementation of an effective
policy designed to bring about
the control of the nuclear
weapon. They are accurate
information and real influence.
It was not until the British had
demonstrated ‘substantial pro-
gress’ (the official and legal
United States requirement for
access to American nuclear
secrets) that British policy-
makers were able to learn what
had been going on in the most
important manufactory of
nuclear progress in the world —
the United States.
“It was because the British
had' for some time possessed
the atom-bomb, and had shown
that they too could command
the resources and the skill
required to develop the
hydrogen-bomb, that they were
able to play a part in the most
important field which has yet
been opened up for the proper
control of these horrible instru-
ments.
“Can it be seriously believed
that there would now be British
participation at the Geneva
conference on the control of
nuclear weapons if Britain had
not shown herself to be one of
the nuclear Powers? And can
there be any abolitionist having
the minimum of understand-
ing of the way in which the
world’s affairs are managed
who would be willing to
sacrifice that participation?
“It is, of course, just possible
that we are on the verge of

an almost unprecedented trans-
formation in the ways of the
world. But it seems more likely
that those who think like this
are led to do so, quite illogi-
cally, by a fevered imagination
resulting perhaps from their
recognition of the revolution-
ary character of the recent
changes in the potential
destructiveness of weapons.
“It is entirely understandable
that a professional soldier, like
Colonel Lort-Phillips, should
recognise that these new
weapons, if ever they should
come to be used, would be
destructive not only of a great
part of mankind itself but also
of the whole basis of thought
upon which the function of
the military element in human
society has hitherto depended
for its justification.
“He has set out expertly and
admirably the quite over-
whelming case for the aboli-
tion of nuclear weapons, indeed
for the effective outlawry of
international war itself. The
case for these things is surely
obvious. So, in my opinion at
any rate, is the corollary of
these objectives—namely, the
establishment of some sort of
international system which will
have the effect of a World
Government in many essential
particulars, and which will
inevitably,' in consequence,
involve something very sub-
stantial in the way of the
surrender of sovereignty.
“But the way to achieve these
desirable things is to adopt
them as an essential element in
our foreign policy. To bring
them about we must remain
in the ‘nuclear club’, both so as
to know what is going on in
the field of nuclear develop-
ment and so as to have as
great an influence as we can
possibly muster upon the
development of world affairs.”

A the future of Africa and

tant issues in world politics
today”) could provide a plat-

sees few signs that the party is
alive to this opportunity:
“The Left of the Labor party
is united in thinking that
Socialist principles ought not
to be sold for votes: even if it
is far from knowing exactly
what its Socialist principles
now ought to be. But no one
at all disputes that there are
millions of poor peasants in
Asia growing poorer as we
grow richer. And no one has
ever disputed yet that every
Socialist —Right, Left and
Centre —must be against starva-
tion.
“It would be misleading to
pretend that the Labor party
could have automatically won
the election by fighting it on

than pensions and purchase-

have lost even more resound-
ingly than it actually did. But,
if so, that is partly its own
fault. The Labor party has
done little to combat the nos-
talgic delusions of grandeur
which have gripped the British
people in this decade ; and not
much more to awaken us to
our colonial responsibilities in
Africa or our human kinship
with the vast populations of
Asia.
“This would be the task it
sets itself now: to shelve its
concern with public ownership
for the next few years, and
unite in a modern version of
Gladstone’s Midlothian cam-
paign. It might not win votes
by doing so. This should be
no deterrent for the Left, who
pride themselves on putting
principle above power. The
Right can comfort its qualms
by reflecting that this would
provide the reasons of principle
for the face-lift it advocates,
reasons which have so far been
lacking.
“And both can remember
that if the electorate is really so
selfish that such a campaign
would be doomed to failure,
then there is no point in having
a Labor party. After all, the
root of Socialism is a faith in
human decency.”
The Russian Budget
■Examining the Budget pro-
■*“' posals for 1960 presented
in the Kremlin at the end of
October to a session of the
Supreme Soviet, Victor Zorza,
in the Manchester “Guardian,”
notes that “Mr. Khrushchev
has not yet backed his hopes
of peaceful coexistence by any
reduction of the Soviet military
budget, which will remain next
year at the same level as this
—96,100-million roubles (£B5BO
millions [stg.] at the official
rate).
“The Deputy Finance
Minister, Mr. Garbuzov, said
that the total Budget expendi-
ture had increased, as it did
every year, and military expen-
diture therefore formed a
smaller proportion of the
whole. The share of military
appropriations would account
next year for 12.9 per cent, of
the total, compared with 13.6
per cent, this year and 19.9 per
cent, in 1955.
“The most that can therefore
be read into [the new] figures
is that the Soviet leaders wish
to give the impression that they
regard the international situa-
tion with sufficient hope to
stabilise their military expen-
diture, while waiting for
further relaxation before they
actually reduce it.
“But this is what they want
these figures to convey to the
world, and it has little to do
with the real level of military

spending, which remains the
mystery it always was.
“Expenditure on science,
which this year rose from 23.9-
million to 27.3-million roubles,
is to increase next year by a
further 15.4 per cent. Again
comparisons with Western
spending on science, which is
divided between Government
and private industry, are
difficult, but the trend itself is
unmistakable and, indeed,
impressive.
“The Russians are clearly
determined to retain the lead
they have established in some
branches of science, but the
preliminary estimates of this
year’s industrial production
given by Mr. Kossygin, the
chief economic planner, show
that the needs of the consumer
are not being forgotten.”
London “Economist,” out-
lining some industrial features
of the Budget, notes that Mr.
Kossygin “had something to
boast about” :
“The planned increase in
gross industrial output for the
current year, the first of the
seven-year plan, is being
exceeded. It is expected that
next year’s target—a further
increase of 8 per cent/ —will
also be exceeded. The achieve-
ment will be the more impres-
sive since it will be accom-
panied by a reduction in work-
ing-hours. The seven-hour
working-day is to be spread
throughout industry next year.
The Soviet planners must,
therefore, be expecting a con-
siderable rise (10 per cent.) in
productivity.
“The faster expansion of
industrial production in general
has enabled Mr. Khrushchev to
promise consumers more
plentiful supplies, particularly
of durable goods, in the coming
years without slowing-down
the rate of growth of heavy
industry.
“Efforts to speed-up the
housing-drive, on the other
hand, must involve a certain
shift in investments. By the
end of this year houses with
a floor-space of 96-million
square-yards are to be built in
Soviet towns alone; in 1960
this figure is to be raised to
120-million square-yards. Mr.
Kossygin also put this in a
different way: next year 10-
million Soviet town-dwellers
will be provided with 2.4-
million new flats. And yet even
this staggering figure is too
small when measured against
Russia’s housing-shortage.”
Passing over to the revenue
side of the Budget, the
“Economist” sees that “the
expected drop in receipts from
the turnover-tax, levied mainly
on consumer-goods, shows that
it is intended to cut prices in
the coming year. This is more
than made-up by increased
returns from the profits-tax.
The emphasis on the small and
declining share of income-tax
is rather facile propaganda. In
a country where the level of
wages is determined by the
planners, and the biggest
revenue comes from an indirect
purchase-tax, income-tax can
easily be suppressed altogether.”
The one blot on this
economic picture, the “Econo-
mist” adds, is cast by the har-
vest, which, “since it is
described only as higher than
the average for the last five
years, cannot have been very
good.
“In spite of this setback, the
planners seem to rely on a
continued growth of food-
supplies. They must also hope
that, without any radical
change in the pattern of indus-
trial production, they will be
able to keep consumers
satisfied. It is probably too
much to expect Mr. Khrush-
chev to slash his defence budget
without bringing a bargain
back from Geneva.”

“What those Indian news-

Discussion has been directed lately to the need
for extending Australia’s markets overseas.
The Export Development Council, in survey
of the situation, says that to sustain the current
rate of economic development we will have to
expand export earnings by as much as two hundred
and fifty million pounds a year over the next
five years.
Exports in 1958-59 brought in more than
eight hundred million pounds. So, on this estimate,
Australia by 1965 would need to be earning almost
one-third as much again in export income as is
coming in now.
That may seem a tall figure to set about
reaching in such a given time. But let us relate
it to our rising resources, and to the channels we
have for expansion. What is the present picture?
Wool is at record levels of production, its
price has improved, its- outlook is favourable. Beef
exports in the past year were more than fifty per
cent, higher than ever before. Meat products were
worth one hundred and ten million pounds in the
twelve months to last June, as against sixty-four
million pounds a year earlier.
Our minerals are rated as being able eventually
to earn Australia more than its wool.
Manufacturing, already bringing in more than
one-seventh of the export income, is set for the
enlargement of its markets.
And with it all, we still are far from having
reached national capacity in, the use of the land.
In one State, Queensland, for instance, the
Government is moving to clear brigalow scrub
from a tract of highly-productive, good-rain-belt
land that is larger in area than the whole
of Tasmania.
To such acquisitions add the quickening
benefits that science is conferring through soil and
pasture and animal research; consider the drive
for trade upon which we have embarked in an
expansionist world economy; and we can see that
all the elements are here for the realising of
whatever goals we may seek in higher production
and richer corpmerce—provided we have the
intelligent and active courage to press on and
reach them.
the undeveloped peoples of
Bhutan, Sikkim, Nepal and
Kashmir under their protec-
tion, while maintaining, as far
as they could, amicable rela-

Chou En-lai means to occupy
the strategic contour, at the
price of creating fear and
enmity throughout India,
Pakistan and Burma.”

exercise the leadership of the
Western alliance. On Euro-
pean questions they can have
that leadership if they can
carry the burden of it. It is
not something that Americans

The leadership of Western

which Americans have been
carrying since World War II

forces are a screen and a trip-

On this country rests the whole
responsibility for deterring the
use of force in Central Europe,
and of waging the war if it
comes to war.
“That being the case, it is
inescapable and unavoidable
that in any question which is
crucial to the defence of
Europe the last word, after all
due consultation, must be with
the United States. We have
the ultimate military respon-
sibility, and as long as we have
it we cannot divest ourselves

responsibility.”

London “Daily Telegraph”:
“Any constructive thoughts
about a better future for
British Central Africa must
start with the admission that
the present could hardly be
worse. The striking merit of
Mr. Macleod’s first Parlia-
ment a r y performance as
Colonial Secretary was his
evident willingness to make
this admission and to conclude
from it that a new approach
is urgently necessary.
“He purposely left vague
what this new approach would
be. But implicit in the whole
tone and content of his speech
was his determination to
modify, if not to end, the
state of emergency in North-
ern Rhodesia and Nyasaland
just as soon as possible.
“With this aim in mind he
has invited the two Governors
to come to London in the near
future. Intimations of greater
flexibility could also be read
into his remarks on Federa-
tion itself and on the pace of
political development within
the two territories under
British control.
“The aim was clearly to
assure the Opposition here, and
African nationalists generally,
that the new Colonial Secretary
approaches his mission with
an open, generous mind, deter-
mined to use the tragedies of
the past as a spur to, rather
than a brake on, a better
future.”

exclusive news, but he said
that it could not be published
until the names had appeared
in the “Gazette.” It was early
in the week, and I pointed out
that by the time the “Gazette”
was published on the coming
Saturday hundreds of
“investors” would have dis-
patched their remittances to
“Tatt.’s.” Was it fair to let
them do this? Wouldn’t it be
better to allow a press-state-
ment to appear, intimating that
the Minister was going to pub-
lish a list of names? After
all, the general public was not
altogether to blame, because
the law seemed to have drifted
into abeyance.
The Minister saw the force
of this reasoning, and eventu-
ally agreed to my publishing
the warning. It caused a wide-
spread flutter; and so far as
the agents were concerned,
their numbers were up.
It was well known that some
members of Parliament were in
the habit of having an under-
cover investment in the “con-
sultations,” usually through
the agency of friends. But they
took the Minister’s action in
good part, recognising that the
law had either to be enforced
or repealed. Some of the
Minister’s caucus friends hailed
him as “Saint Josiah,” but he
laughed that off and stuck to
his guns.
Ultimately the Post and
Telegraph Act was amended
to give the Postmaster-General
“discretionary power” to issue
orders prohibiting the Post
Office from handling articles
addressed to persons supposed
to be engaged in lotteries. The
extent and application of this
embargo was clarified later,
when the Postmaster-General,
in reply to a question asked
in the House of Representa-
tives, gave a number of reasons
for the action taken. The
main policy-decision was that
the Post Office should not
intervene in regard to enter-
prises sanctioned by State
authorities.
DR. MALONEY
STARTED SOMETHING
Dr. William Maloney,
M.H.R., had a pet
aversion. He hated the
editorial “we.” When
reduced to its lowest propor-
tions, the “we” usually came
to be revealed as one man, the
editor. Maloney did not like
the “we” to stand as the mouth-
piece of a great, mysterious
and powerful authority.
When I was on the first
steps of the journalistic ladder
I sensed a feeling among news-
paper controllers that if names
of staff - members headed
articles it would tend towards
the creation of a buying-
market for their services.
It was believed by the rank-
and-file in those years that
there was an understanding
among the Melbourne proprie-
tors that they would not
openly trade for the services
of journalists in the employ of
their competitors. But there
were ways of dodging this
arrangement, and when an
editor or chief-of-staff became
aware that a “feeler” was being
put out for one of his best
men he was often able to
induce the proprietor to make
the weekly pay-envelope of the
man in question a little heavier.
Today the picture is very
different. The whole concept
has been reversed. Now news-
papers are conducted on the
assumption that the names of
skilled and popular writers
assist circulation. The dailies
are replete with names of
columnists and special writers.
The mighty editorial “we” has
almost disappeared.
But in the old days it dis-
turbed Maloney’s political
equipoise to be faced with the
forceful “we” in his daily
paper. A number of his Labor
colleagues in the House of
“Ranji,” a familiar Mel-
bourne newspaper street-
character at the turn of
the century.
Representatives held similar
views. To bring the question
to an issue “the little Doctor”
framed a motion expressing
the view that all articles of
a political nature in news-
papers should be signed by the
writers, the idea being that if
the reader knew that it was
only Bill Smith or Tom Jones
who was attacking the Labor
party, he would evaluate it
accordingly.
But private members’ busi-
ness on the Notice Paper
stands a poor chance of ever
coming before the House for
discussion unless sanctioned by
the Ministry in power. Despite
several unsuccessful attempts
to have his motion debated,
Maloney gravely rose to the
accompaniment of laughing
“Hear hears” at the beginning
of each session, and gave
notice of his same old motion,
the terms of which he read
so ponderously and impres-
sively that it sounded like a
mournful forecast of the
funeral of just another still-
born political child.
At long last his opportunity
came when a Labor Adminis-
tration gained the Treasury
benches in 1910. Maloney’s
suggestion was incorporated
in a modified form in an
amendment of the Electoral
Act in 1912, to come into
operation a certain number of
days before and after election-
days.
The law instigated by
Maloney did not remain long
in force. Today it has been
whittled away to a formal
announcement that responsi-
bility under electoral law for
all election comment is
accepted by the editor. But
now no law is needed, as many
newspapers seem only too ready
to disclose the names of their
regular political columnists.
Maloney may not be
remembered for any other
political achievements. He was
what can be described as a
“popular local member” for
the Labor constituency he
represented, always being ready
to afford a little financial help
to poor constituents. Perhaps
he was best known, however,
through a kind of medical
clinic he conducted. He gave
advice free and with medicine
at 2s. 6d. a bottle.
If the patient happened to
be in straitened circumstances
there was no charge, even for
the additional prescription,
“And God bless you!”
It can be understood that
he was not very popular
among members of the British
Medical Association, a body
which Labor members often
referred to as a tighter trade-
union than any of those which
had their official headquarters
at the Melbourne Trades Hall.
Maloney died in 1940, and
it came as a surprise when it
was reported in the press that
he had left as much as £5OOO.
But it transpired that this was
the gross amount, and that
there were many debts to be
squared-up. There were also
several provisions to which
the executors found it difficult
to give effect. Eventually they
gave-up the job, and the Public
Trustee had to take charge.
A prospective beneficiary told
me recently that the estate had
not even then been wound-up,
and that the prospects were
that only a few hundred
pounds would ultimately be
available to those entitled
under the will.

an account of the “Federal Capital
Jugglery” which finally ended in
Canberra winning by one changed
vote in the Senate! Also, a
curious little story of a small ship’s
mysterious disappearance in the

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Natives in W.A.
In his latest report to Par-
liament the Native Welfare
Commissioner in W.A. stresses
the failure of 10 years’ efforts
to acquire land for a native-
settlement in Perth metropoli-
tan area. He says that
obviously natives aren’t wanted
around the suburbs; and he
claims that natives and his
department are subjected to
unfair and unwarranted
criticism.
He’s right on the first cpunt.
Natives aren’t’wanted around
cities, mainly because they’re
not suited to city life—a fact
which is recognised, but some-
times not admitted, by their
staunchest supporters and sym-
pathisers. (The * daily press
pretends to sponsor the
settling of native families in
houses in w'hite communities,
but invariably in working-class
suburbs.)
The Commissioner is on
shakier ground when he
claims that natives and his
department are unfairly or
unwarrantably criticised.
Compared with the trouble
natives cause, the criticism
levelled against them is very
mild. The average suburban
householder, however he may
have suffered at their hands,
is sympathetic to them and is
prepared to do what he can
to help them ; and when, worn-
out of patience or perhaps
genuinely alarmed for the
safety of his family, he dares
to criticise them, he arouses
the ire of residents of other
districts where natives are most
unlikely ever to appear.
If the Commissioner wants
to get a true picture of the
general attitude to natives, I
suggest he approach house-
holders in a suburb where
natives are living and making
nuisances of themselves, and
that he seek signatures to a
petition asking for their
removal from the district.
He’d be surprised at the reluct-
ance of even victims of the
natives’ drunkenness and
truculence to sign a petition
that could deprive them of a
roof.
I recently circulated such a
petition. I had to. The
natives were occupying a con-
demned dwelling and had
made it almost unlivable.
There were grossly inadequate
sanitary provisions, and some
of the neighbors were con-
cerned for their health. All
the nearer neighbors had
several times been alarmed at
the ferocity of the brawls,
resented the obscenities to
which “their children were
forced to listen, and feared the
“ Darlin g— ain't you carrying this quarrel of ours
too far?"
effect on growing children of
the spectacle of women being
stunned by pickets and kicked
while they were down.
I was reluctant to draft the
petition, and the other victims
were loath to sign it. Some
wouldn’t sign it, although they
admitted that if the natives
remained they themselves
would have to leave.
Sympathy for the natives is
general, but helping them isn't
a job for individuals or even
individual communities. It’s a
State concern, and there’s
machinery, of a sort, to deal
with it. In some cases the
machinery works reasonably
well, but it breaks-down badly
in the attempt to house natives
in white communities.
Why not face the facts?
Only a very small proportion
of the natives around cities are
sufficiently civilised for city or
suburban life. No landlord
with an ounce of common-
sense would dream of letting
his house to them, and no
community would welcome
them. That goes for the big
majority. If you house the
minority in individual houses
scattered throughout several
districts they’re lonely and
isolated ; and talk of assimila-
tion is mostly idle.
If it’s accepted that natives
are entitled to a place in city
life, then there’s ample room
around Perth for the only
type of experiment that’s
likely to succeed.
The Government should
resume a few hundred acres
of vacant land and create a
settlement, for natives alone,
In a new suburb within trans-
port distance of the city.
House the natives there, send
the children to schools in
adjoining suburbs, insist on
their being properly dressed
and clean, and enforce all the
conditions expected of whites.
The adults in the settlement
could be given employment at
reasonable wages, but with the
stipulation of reasonable work
done in return. Their move-
ments would not be restricted,
but they would be barred from
all intoxicating drinks. That’s
another fact that must be
faced natives can’t take
alcohol.
As the children left school
they could be encouraged to
find work in the city, in com-
petition with white children of
similar ages. Properly trained,
they’re suitable for office-
work and trades, and their
color wouldn’t be a bar either
with employers or workmates.
All this would cost money,
and there’s no guarantee it
would succeed ; but it would
give a chance to natives who
would work ; and youths could
grow-up in company with
whites, but with an oppor-
tunity to seek marriage part-
ners in their own class. That
might prove to be the greatest
single factor in raising the
natives to our standard of
civilisation. Pieter Nuyts
(W.A.).
Lawson Defended
It has been refreshing to
browse through the “Memoirs
of a Pioneer Pressman.” They
are written with an understand-
ing that could only come from
personal knowledge o f the
characters concerned.
Particularly delightful was
the note on the writer whose
works, in the opinion of many,
will survive as long as those of
any other Australian author,
and longer than most—Henry
Lawson. Baxter Cook's long
association with journalism and
his evident knowledge of Aus-
tralian writers give to his praise
of Lawson a reassuring ring of
authority. What a contrast
with “Cunedda” (B. 7/10/’59),


who holds that “many Aus-
tralians have never liked either
Lawson’s writings or his parti-
cular conception of demo-
cracy.”
To condemn out of hand, as
“Cunedda” apparently does,
the writings of one whose
stories are admired in many
parts of the world is surely
a bit presumptuous. Maybe
“Cunedda” didn’t have the
good fortune to know Law-
son’s “country” ; or Lawson’s
.“mates.” A pity; they were
worth knowing..
Lawson knew sadness and
gladness ; he knew his country ;
and he knew his “mates” in
that wonderful way the men of
the A.I.F. knew one another.
(How prophetic was his “They
will fight for right or a grand
mistake, as men never fought
before"!) At heart he belonged
to the “bush,” where he was
born and bred, and where
mateship meant a great deal ;
and his stories are clear-cut
cameos of Australian life.
As for his “democracy,”
Henry had some powerful
ideas about what is necessary
to make people happy. He had
a strong leaning towards the
underdog, and didn’t forget to
let people know about it occas-
ionally. It may not have earned
him bouquets in certain places,
but then the ways and means
of raising people to a state
approaching happiness are not
always a popular after-dinner
subject. Stephen Blake
(N.S.W.).
Accused Aldermen
The Council of the City of
Greater Wollongong has
expressed dissatisfaction with
amendments to the Local
Government Act promised by
the N.S.W. Minister.
The story, goes back to 1958,
when one of the council’s aider-
men was fined £75 for having
accepted a £l5O bribe to influ-
ence a contract.
There’s nothing in the L.G.
Act to say that an alderman,
after such a conviction, is
automatically disqualified. In
fact; the alderman in question,
an A.L.P. man, continued for
some months to sit in council,
and even to preside over com-
mittee-meetings without, in that
time, lodging ,an appeal. He
did appeal in due course, and
lost. Ultimately he resigned
under party pressure.
However, the set-up of the
council has changed in the past
12 months, though not the
personnel. Four aldermen now
sitting have been expelled from
the A.L.P., practically all of
them for voting contrary to the
dictates of the all-powerful
Labor Municipal Assembly, a
group of union-officials sitting
behind closed doors.
A motion was carried asking
that the Local Government
Act be amended to maintain a
higher standard of ethics in
councils. The Minister, in
reply, said he would agree to
“ Cuthbertson —a Woman aboard my craft! Get her
off IMMEDIATELY!”
put through an amendment to
the. effect that an alderman or
councillor convicted of an
offence such as one under the
Secret Commissions Act should
automatically lose his seat.
This did not satisfy the newly
freed members of the council,
and by majority decision they
carried a motion saying the
amendment recommended does
not go far enough. A member
subjected to a specific charge,
they contended, should seek
leave-of-absence until the case
has been heard and his name
cleared. The Minister, who is

Canberra Buses
Congratulations to “II
Vecchio” (B. 4/11 / ’59) on his
complimentary remarks about
bus-crews in Canberra. But
I doubt if he has had much
need to travel in the vehicles
these men so admirably control.
Granted, there are printed
timetables, in book - form,
obtainable at 9d. each, together
with timetable-schedules at
bus-stops. These are very good
as far as they go ; but has
“II Vecchio’’ waited half-an-
Jhour for a bus that just doesn’t
come?

Does he enjoy spending 40
to 50 minutes in a bus which,
because of its devious route,
takes that time to cover a
journey easily covered in a car
in 10 minutes, or on a push-
bike in less than half-an-hour?
Canberra is a growing city,
and the authorities in control
of the bus-service should start
thinking about providing direct
bus-routes from one part of
the capital to another, without
having to travel through four
or five different suburbs on the
way.
Admittedly, the authorities
have their troubles because of
the extraordinarily high car-
population in the city ; but
surely a feasible system can
be worked-out so as to travel
from A to B without going
practically through the alpha-
bet first.
Nevertheless, I heartily
endorse “II Vecchio's” admira-
tion of the bus-crews —cour-

Vegetable-growers’ Claim
Roberston (N.S.W.) vege-
table-growers’ decision to claim
Government relief for crops
ruined in recent torrential rains
makes flood-damage history.
Coming from a district 2500 ft.
up, and therefore clear from
any dangers of major river-
rising (cause of most rural
flood-damage), and with terrain
which normally provides a
natural drainage-system, the
claim is unique.
But the district’s October
rains—26in. —were anything
but normal, in both quantity
and character. The tally was
four times the October average,
and came from a series of
storms of prolonged and
torrential violence. Coming
right in the peak of the potato-
planting season, the rains
caught growers off-guard, with
hundreds of acres of freshly-
cultivated ground on their
hands. The loose hillside soil,
very porous at any time, was a
sitting-shot for surface-wash.
The result was not in the
true sense flood-damage but
wholesale washaway of top-
soil and everything in it.
Robertson old-timers say
they’ve never seen anything
like it. Growers, at a hurriedly-
called meeting, estimated their
out-of-pocket losses for seed,
fertiliser and labor for potatoes
alone at £14,000, and are claim-
ing accordingly. Area affected
is about 200 acres.
As well, they’re claiming for
a fair acreage of peas and
cabbage also wholly or partly
ruined. But what they can’t
estimate is the enormous tonn-
age of valuable topsoil—red-
soil at that —lost for ever to
their hill-land paddocks. And
so we find our old enemy
erosion raising his ugly head
on a new front, an area
previously thought to be
reasonably safeguarded by its
own natural drainage.
An asset becoming overnight
a potential liability—irrespec-
tive of cash claims, that’s some-
thing the State authorities will
have to sit up and take notice
of. — Kune (N.S.W.).

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
ORANGE FIELD DAY
By ROLLO GILLESPIE
Origin and Aim
TVjring War II various Gov-
ernments pleaded for in-
creased production of food by
Australia, so that more could
be sent to Britain. Around
Orange (N.S.W.) graziers and
farm-machinery agents got to-
gether and decided the way
primary producers could grow
more and better food, apart
from applying sound common-
sense, was by making the
utmost use of mechanisation.
That idea started the Orange
Field Day —nowadays it’s in
the plural; it spreads over
three days.
These Field Days—organised
annually by the Graziers’
Association of N.S.W. (Orange
branch) and Orange farm-
machinery agents—are non-
profitmaking. The aim is to
give manufacturers of farm-
machinery and other aids to
primary production an oppor-
tunity of showing the capabili-
ties of their products in com-
It is gratifying to note
the 61 per cent, rise in
the Australian wool
cheque for the first
quarter of the current
year, compared with the
same quarter of 1958.
The total was up by
£22.6 million, bringing
it to £59.3 million,
according to figures
released by the National
Council of Wool
Brokers of Australia.
This substantial rise
will no doubt keep
Australia well up the
list of large wool-
producing countries.
Also, at the top of the
list is Elastrator for
Castrating and Tailing.
The Elastrator Rubber

humane.

them to compare jobs done by
each type or make.
It is important to recapitu-
late the origin and aim of this
annual event, which opened
unofficially during War II and
officially in 1952. Since then
this aim has sometimes been
forgotten.
Choice of Site
To achieve the aim the
Orange Field Day Committee
(composed of local graziers and
farm-machinery agents all
working voluntarily) rents each
year a suitable property of
about 250 acres, divides it into
areas for demonstration and
exhibition, and organises a
programme which allows ex-
hibitors of every type of
machinery or other aids to
show their wares under work-
ing conditions.
Every year since 1952
attendance has increased.
Numbers started at 5000 ; in
1958 some 28,000 farmers and
graziers from all States
attended ; and future field-days
promise an increase.
1959 Field Days
The Eighth (1959) Annual
Field Days took place from
November 17 to 19 on R. K.
Gordon’s property, The
Triangle, 2\ miles north of
Orange, and in C. Sommer-
ville’s adjoining orchard. This
site was chosen by the com-
mittee because of its percentage
of arable land, gentle gradient
and established pastures and
crops suitable for fodder-
conservation ; and also because
a nearby airstrip was available
for spectators’ aircraft and
those used for aerial-spraying.
N.S.W. Minister for Agri-
culture Roger Nott opened the
event on the afternoon of
November 17. He was accom-
panied by Charles Cutler,
M.L.A., leader of the N.S.W.
Country Party and member
for Orange.
New Implement Awards
The Minister presented New
Implement Awards of Merit
(introduced at the 1956 field-
day) to:
British, Tractors Pty., Ltd.,
for the Bisley fingerwheel rake,
which can make two windrows
in a single operation ;
Ronaldson Brothers and
Tippett, Ltd., for a mechanical
woolpress ;
F. W. Williams (Rural)
Pty., Ltd., for the Homestead
lamb-weighing cradle ; for the
Homestead monkey - hoist
(which counterweights the
monkey of an Ajax-type wool-
press) ; and for the Homestead
wire-spinner ;
Belcher - Built Equipment,
Ltd., from Auckland (N.Z.),
for a silage-fork and a drain-
cleaning and drain-digging
attachment for tractors;
Dalgety and Co., Ltd., for
a seeder which sows by vibra-
tion.
These awards are given each
year for complete machines or
appliances which have definite
application to any form of
primary production, and which
either fulfil some valuable pur-
pose no other machine has
hitherto been available for or
embody some useful new prin-
ciple of working.
Exhibits eligible for this
year’s award must have been
available throughout Australia
from normal retailers since
September 1, 1958.
The awards —non-competi-
tive, because any number of
machines may receive endorse-
ment for quality and practical
or economic value are
assessed by a panel of inde-
pendent judges chosen by the
committee. Each member of
this panel is an expert in some
field of primary production.
This year’s panel comprised a
senior officer of the N.S.W.
Department of Agriculture,
a mechanical - engineering
authority from the University
of N.S.W. and a practical
farmer of recognised ability.
Scientist, mechanical-engineer
and man on the land, they
should be able to reach an
unexceptionable judgment.
Other Awards
Minister Nott also presented
the Lincoln Electric Welding
Awards —a competition (spon-
sored by the Lincoln Electric
Co.) open to those whose main
source of income is from
primary production and who
built the entry on their own
welding-plant. First-prize in
this award went to I. C. Thorn-
craft, of Summer Hill, near
Orange, for a mobile p.t.0.-
driven hammermill. C. R.

Preparations
Arriving at Orange the day
before the field-days were
opened, I went out to the
ground on November 16 to see
what goes on behind the scenes
in immediate preparation for
the event. This, of course, is
an important but comparatively
small part of the all-round-the-
year organisation put in by the
committee. Knowing Hugh
Jackson (this year’s chairman),
hon. sec. Gordon Ratcliffe and
other committee-members, like
Bert Ostini, I wasn’t surprised
to see the work they were
doing, but it was an education
to hear the many problems
they had to answer. All were
dealt with, and politely, sens-
ibly but firmly settled.
Going round the exhibits on
the opening-day I met two old
friends, Leighton Richardson,
from Gippsland, who had
called in at Orange to see what
went on, and Bob McMurchie,
of the Australian Wool Bureau
in Melbourne.
Some Exhibits
Walking together down the
line, noting the various dis-
plays, we were particularly
pleased to meet S. V. Belcher
(of Belcher-Built Equipment),
who won two awards and had
come over from New Zealand
specifically to bring his
machinery to Orange for the
field-day. His silage-fork and
hydraulically operated drain-
cleaner (which gives a revolu-
tionary method of cleaning
agricultural and roadside
drains) are excellent products.
Nearby there was the
Ronaldson Tippett A.M.
woolpress (which also won an
award) and a series of crop-
implements swing - saws,
chain-saws, grain-augers, etc.,
made by Mobilco —and the
new David Brown Albion
forage-harvester, the Busatis
three-point linkage-mower and
the new David Brown 950 A
tractor, displayed for the first
time in N.S.W. The Bisley
fingerwheel side-delivery rake
(another winner) was also on
show at this stand.
The Royal Garage, Orange
agents for Massey Ferguson,
showed the new 585 Massey
Ferguson self-propelled header,
which has a 12|ft. cut and 45
controlled speeds, and three
other new Massey Ferguson
products, a sod-seeder, a
broadcaster and a new small,
compact silage-forager.

vertical grain-auger, which was
on show, incorporates a built-

Internat ion a 1 Harvesters,
represented in Orange by H.
Lapham and Son, showed the
new A2l-2 buckrake and
A2l-1 side-delivery rake, with
several other new implements.
For Orchardists
Dangar, Gedye and Malloch,
Ltd., showed the Nevertire
orchard-spray plant with its
fibreglass vat which eliminates
corrosion or wood-shrinkage.
Nearby were the new Harvey
Imp fruit-grader and Float-
packer fruit-sizing machine,
which introduces the Harvey
Counterflow belt-accumulator
for hand-sorting. All these
Harvey products come from
Daniel Harvey, Ltd., of Box
Hill (Vic.).
The Bamford haymaking
machinery and Bamford-Long
BL6O p.t.0.-drive pick-up baler
and three-point-linkage mower
were also worth looking at.
Plastics
The Nylex plastics shown
by Moulded Products (A’sia),
Ltd., were impressive, especially
the polythene pipe which can
be laid by a mouldboard-plough
to 18in. below the ground at the
rate of 600 ft. in lOmin. Nylex
rigid Vinyl pipe, though new
to Australia, has been used
with success in other parts of
the world, and has enough
strength and hardness to
replace metal piping while
giving the advantages of light
weight, resistance to corrosion
and insulation from heat and
electricity.
Yeomans’ Tritter
Ringer, though, of the whole
display-ground was the
Yeomans’ Tritter, which had
its world premiere on the dis-
play-block of Yeomans Pty.,
Ltd.
This revolutionary forage-
harvester has been designed as
an efficient cutter and loader
that will eliminate stones,
boulders, low stumps and
regrowth. It incorporates banks
of 4|lb. axe-hammers, which
rotate at speed to pulverise rock,
mulch scrub and shear-off tree-
trunks. Yet it can be drawn
by a tight tractor, and does a
superb job of harvesting and
loading.
Two Queenslanders I met
there told me they had made
the 800-mile journey to Orange
just to see this remarkable
machine ; having seen it in
action —though only as a

Results
Everyone I asked stressed
the value of these field-days.
For instance, A. S. Wells,
western representative of Tutt
Bryant (N.S.W.) Pty., Ltd. —
incidentally, he married Sadie
Toy, who was the original
“Sister Sadie” of the “Woman’s
Mirror”—gave his verdict:
“They’re splendid! A farmer
came in after Christmas one
year and bought a £7OOO
machine from me, because he'd
seen it at this field-day,” Wells
spoke highly of the indirect
results of the event.
Hugh Harvey, of Daniel
Harvey, Ltd., of Box Hill, Mel-
bourne —he’s the son of the
Daniel Harvey who founded
the firm —emphasised direct
results, and said that their firm
recognised they couldn’t afford
to miss the field-days.
Resistance
That is why it’s astonishing
to find resistance offered to the
field-days by certain commer-
cial interests. In a way, I
suppose, this boycott is a com-
pliment. No one could ignore
the field-days, now that they
have attracted practical farmers
from all over the Common-
wealth and look like becoming
a centre of international
interest. It may suit certain
manufacturers and companies
to resist the event simply
because it’s hard to assess

direct sales-results from such a
presentation of products. There
may be other reasons for the
boycott.
Anyway, the policy seems
shortsighted, particularly if the
aim of the field-days is under-
stood and their achievement
recognised. As salesmen on the
ground constantly say: “This
is where we sell the goods;
they are seen here in practical
demonstration —not standing
on a block, as at the Royal
Shows.” It’s a matter of prin-
ciple, which ought to be decided
soon. Who knows best what
the customer wants? I*d
venture to suggest that the
man who sells the goods at or
as a result of Orange Field
Days knows more about it
than executives in the capital
cities. It would be interesting
to hear the views of the head-
offices.
Government Plans
There was a disappointment
this year when, owing to short-
age of funds, the Governments
said it would not be possible
to pursue the idea suggested
last year of holding a national
competition for new imple-
ments. It was hoped that such
a competition might eventually
lead to the establishment of a
national machine-testing station
run on practical lines by
practical men. Alone of all
important agricultural countries
in the world, Australia lacks
such a station.
But the State and Federal
Governments have decided to
delay the furthering of this
idea. Instead, the N.S.W.
Agricultural Department is
forming a machinery-extension
service under a qualified
engineer, who will adjudicate
on the capabilities of various
machines. Most manufactur-
ing firms already employ at
least three qualified engineers
for this very purpose, yet still
produce a proportion of
rubbish, so it can only be
hoped that the Government
official will be more successful
in his endeavors. His duties may
include translation of overseas
literature dealing with farm-
machinery. Some 70 per cent,
of the farm-machinery used
in Australia is manufactured on
the domestic market; the
remaining 30 per cent., which
is imported, all has to be
modified to suit Australian con-
ditions, so this official will need
to wield his blue-pencil with
discretion if he is not just to
spend taxpayers’ money in
loading practical farmers with
a lot of unnecessary literature
which they'll only put in the
incinerator.
The question is: Can the
Government give the public
what it wants and avoid follow-
ing Parkinson’s law, which
states that work expands so as
to fit the time available for
its completion (or, conversely,
that public servants tend to
triplicate themselves)? If it can
do this, the Government will
be performing a badly-needed
service to the farmer.

successful as ever. Under Mrs.
R. H. Kennedy’s direction, the

$
The Tritter is the most versatile of all forage
harvesters, not only in the type of country that
it will handle, but in the scope of its uses. The
basic Tritter comes equipped with a main chute
which stands almost vertically upright above the
bowl and feeds into its own self-contained silage
basket. This has a capacity of about 54 cubic
yards.
The same chute is employed in a different posi-
tion on the main bowl at about 45 degrees back
from the first position for the loading of tipping
trailers. Tipping trailers are available in 40-yard,
15-yard, and 20-yard capacity. The Tritter may
also be employed for side loading with a special
top chute or spout.

Keesteel axe hammers on the Tritter
pivot on 11" diameter high tensile steel
pins. These replace the conventional
flimsy flails and light pins of outdated
forage harvesters. This means that
under normal grass conditions there
is no wear whatsoever. Under test on
the Yeomans Keyline demonstration
properties the Tritter was deliberately
driven through rocky outcrops such as
shown at left. No breakdown occurred
during the whole test time. Now those
areas have been converted to smooth
pasture. The Tritter still does a better
job of forage harvesting than any
machine we have seen.

forage harvester
that won’t break
down. The Yeomans
Tritter was designed
at the request of
clients for an effi-
cient cutter and
loader that would
eliminate stones,
boulders, low stumps
and re-growth. The
Tritter does all this
in the most spec-
tacular way and cuts
and loads forage
faster as a result.
The Tritter pulver-
ises rock, mulches
scrub, shears off tough stumps, can be drawn
by a light tractor and does its job of harvesting
and loading supremely well.

mighty job of feeding the
hungry multitudes.
Sanitation was poor. Latrines
were wrongly sited—there’s
hardly a place for one in the
middle of the parking-area,
where people are apt to picnic
—and they are crudely furni-
shed. There were no garbage
bins to be seen, so paper and
sandwich-packets were blowing
all over the landscape.
The loudspeakers tended to
be annoying, too. Mostly used
for advertising, they made
conversation difficult, until
people learned the knack of
ignoring them—and then they
lost their advertising value,
They are certainly needed for
important announcements, and
they might be more effective if
kept for that purpose only,
• Occasionally you can’t help
noting silly things. One example
was a hoist manned by spec-
tators listening to the opening-
address and a lot of others
standing directly underneath
the platform. It only needed
someone to pull the wrong
lever.
These small points of criticism
do nothing to take away from
the success of an event which
reflects high credit on all con-
cerned with its organisation.
The function is as exhilarating
as the idea which founded it.
At Orange a group of practical
enthusiasts are doing their best
to help Australia. More than
one inter-State visitor remarked
to me that to come to Orange
Field Day was an education.

the two best-producing breeds
(Friesian and A. 1.5.) over the
273 days is 33.821 b. and 29.501 b.
respectively. Average daily
production of a Danish Red,
producing the minimum
requirement (11,0001 b.), over
365 days is 32.871 b. These
figures support the contention
that the Danish Red is the
best dairy breed in the world.
The late Dr. Hagedoorn gave
an interesting explanation of
why Danish Reds have not
spread quickly throughout the
world. Various “experts”
rejected the breed because the
bulls had effeminate heads.
In other words, they didn’t
look good!
Apple Leaf-hopper
“Pyrus”: Apple leaf-hoppers
pierce the leaf-surface and suck
sap from around the punctures,
causing discolored areas which
gradually spread over the whole
leaf and usually kill it. Fruit
gets marked by the insects’
excrement, which is spread by
rain or dew into dirty-brown
streaks and blotches and needs
to be carefully washed-off
before the fruit is marketed.
The female leaf-hopper lays
minute eggs under the surface
of the bark, during autumn
and early winter. These usually
hatch-out during September
and October, and become full-
grown in about six weeks. The
females then lay eggs on the
leaf-stalks, mid-ribs and veins,
which hatch between December
and February, and the insects
are full-grown in three or four
weeks. At least two, and some-
times three, generations are
therefore produced each season.
This pest is controlled by two
sprayings with either nicotine-
sulphate and white-oil or
nicotine-sulphate and soap
during late spring, with three
weeks between the sprayings.

Equine Anaemia
“Osdoc”: Possibly brought

Queensland, where some
properties have lost as many

known throughout the world,
except in the United Kingdom
and New Zealand. No one
knows how it got into Queens-
land from New Guinea.
Perhaps it was spread by birds
or insects.
Sheepdogs
[From “Bilwon”]
'T'he cardinal rule in training
-*• sheepdogs is: “Never lose
your patience!” A puppy, like
a child, can learn only one
thing at a time and will become
confused if you try to teach too
many things at once. A bad-
tempered trainer will finish-up
with a bad-tempered dog.
The dog must be chained-up
for discipline, but too much
chaining makes it dull and lazy.
A dog does best in a netted
yard, where it can be chained
or allowed to exercise, but
won’t come into contact with
children or other dogs.
When the youngster is about
five months old start its train-
ing by taking it out on a reason-
ably long lead and teaching it
to come back to your feet when
called. At first you will have
to use the lead to bring it
back. But the dog will soon
recognise the instruction and
obey without your help, pro-
vided you always give the
instruction the same way.
The dog should next be
taught to lie down and keep
down until you give it the
order to get up. A well-trained
sheepdog must do this, so the
lesson is one of the most
important in the dog’s training.
Unless the dog learns this
lesson, it will have little chance
of holding a mob in the corner
of a small paddock when it is
working sheep close.
Once the dog has learned to
“come here” and “lie down”
Polythene pipe, made by Moulded Products (A’sia), Ltd.,
being laid.
when told, you can discard the
lead and take the youngster
out among a few sheep. Don’t
train it with an experienced dog,
as it will only follow what the
other dog does, with no idea
why it is doing it, and first time
out on its own it will be all at
sea.
Put a few sheep in a small
paddock, but teach the dog to
follow the horse close and not
to worry about the sheep at
this stage of the game. Just
move round the edge of them
with the dog close behind.
Tell it to lie down while you
go ahead with the horse. After
a while look round to make
sure it is in the same place.
Then call it to you, and go on
doing this until the dog under-
stands what you want and will
do it every time.
The youngster should be well
over six months by now, and
should be ready to work a few
sheep on its own if it has learnt
the lessons well. This is where
you need all your patience,
though. If you rush things now
you’ll spoil all the effort so far
put into the dog.
Ride round the sheep, keep-
ing the dog on the outside,
behind the horse. Then make
it lie down near the sheep while
you ride over the other side
of them, and from there call it,
making sure it goes round the
flock and not through them.
By doing this the dog will get
to know the sheep and won’t
rush them as soon as it enters
the paddock.
When the dog can obey these
simple commands teach it to
bring the sheep to you by send-
ing it out behind the flock and
calling it in closer, so that the
sheep move towards the horse
with the dog behind them. You
can now start to ride ahead,
leaving the dog to move the
sheep along behind you. The
dog will only do this success-
fully if its earlier training has
been thoroughly assimilated.
After a few weeks of this
teach the dog to wheel the
sheep—making a circle with
the horse and getting the dog
to keep the sheep close behind
you.
From here you can teach it
to draft the animals in a corner
and hold them there. If inclined
to be headstrong or impatient,
the dog will not stop behind
the sheep for any length of
time, and more training will
be needed.
Once you have trained the
dog to do all this it will have
learnt “sheep sense” and won’t
panic when difficulties occur.
More than that, it will rely on
your signals and hand-move-
ments to tell it what to do.

What dre the principal differences
between the false killer-whale and
the true killer-whale ?
Although anatomical differences
between the two species are small
and the feeding-habits similar, a
generic distinction is generally
accepted. The false killer was
named Pseudorca crassidens from
specimens taken in the Baltic in
the early 1860’s. It is usually
blackish all over, sometimes paler
below, and its flippers are narrower,
more pointed and relatively shorter
than those of the true killeg
(Grampus orca ). Its teeth, of
which there are from 8 to 11 on
each side of the upper jaw and
from 8 to 12 on each side of the
lower, are similar in shape and
disposition to those of the latter
species. The largest recorded male
specimen was 19ft. in length;
females average about 10ft. With
true killers, the male may reach
N.N.: So they lost all their money
The false killer has a cosmopolitan
range, but is probably more numer-
ous in Arctic regions, and it
migrates to sub-tropical waters to
breed. It seems to hunt in larger
packs than the true killer.

Biographical details about Ameri-
can pact Frederic Ogden Nash ?
He was born at Rye, New York
State, on August 19, 1902, and was
educated at St. George’s School,
Rhode Island, and at Harvard.
After a short period as a bond-
salesman he worked with a firm
of publishers, and in 1931 published
two volumes of verse, Hard Lines
and Free Wheeling, which at once
attracted attention by their rich
vein of humor, their freedom of
scansion and their unconven-
tionality of thought. Thereafter
he became a prolific and popular
writer of humorous verse. In
addition to his amusing or non-
sensical poems he composed
occasional serious pieces, and there
is always an undercurrent of sage
philosophy running through his
work. Among his best-known
collections of verse are The Face
Is Familiar (1941), Parents Keep
Out (1951), The Private Dining
Room (1952) and You Can’t Get
There From Here (1957).

Some information on “Rolf
Boldrewood”?
Real name Thomas Alexander
Browne. Born in England on
August 6, 1826; came to Australia
in 1831 and was educated at W. T.
Cape’s school in Sydney, subse-
quently at the Sydney College. In
1844 he took-up some land near
Port Fairy (Vic.), living and work-
ing there until 1856. He visited
England in 1860, and in 1864
acquired property in the Riverina
(N.S.W.). Bad seasons (1866-68)
made him give-up squatting, and
in 1871 he became a police-
magistrate and goldfields commis-
sioner at Gulgong. He held these
positions and similar ones at
Dubbo, Armidale and Albury until
1895. In the ’eighties he was
contributing articles and serial-
stories to Australian weeklies.
Ups and Downs: A Story of Aus-
tralian Life, was published in book-
form in London in 1878 and was
well reviewed; it was reissued as
The Squatter's Dream in 1890. In
1884 Old Melbourne Memories was
published in Melbourne. In 1888
Robbery Under Arms was pub-
lished in three volumes, and other
novels appeared in quick succession.
Browne lived near Melbourne from
the time of his retirement in 1895
to his death on March 11, 1915.
Robbery Under Arms became a
classic in his lifetime, and continues
to rank as an outstanding Australian
novel.

REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(12/11/’59)
Queensland should receive moderate to good rains
during December, though with heavy falls and consequent
flooding in north-coastal and Peninsula areas, the north-west
and part of the south-west; falls, however, likely to be light
in the far south-west.
Moderate to good rains are indicated in N.S.W. during
December, heaviest on the South Coast, Southern Tablelands,
South-west Slopes and in part of the Riverina. Good general
rains are indicated for January, with heaviest falls in the
northern divisions and on the North Coast.
Rainfall should vary from moderate to good in Vic-
toria during December, although the Mallee and Wimmera
are likely to have only light rain. P/iasonably good rains
should be received in January and February.
Poor rainfall is indicated in most of South Australia
during December. Rainfall should vary considerably in
January, with isolated heavy falls in the interior.
Western Australia will probably have poor rainfall in
December, but good general rains should occur in January.

In loverly Adelaide’s pastal slopes,
He practiced day and night.
With bat and ball, with swinging

To make his cricket bright.
No keener man on field was he,
His scores became Uneque.
And records tumbled constantly—
His efforts far from bleak.
But all this lay ahead some-where,
As on those Adelaide Moores.
His eyes and Muscles, Young and fair,
Grew ready for the cause.
His greatness grew in Aussie-land,

He seemed to hold right in his hand,
The cricket world’s “V.C.’s’’

THE HOLLIDAYS
“Well, this is ONE rain-dance that should be successfu —my back's starting to ache.”
New Recordings
Faith and Spirituals
According to Charles Burr,
who wrote the notes on the
jacket of Jubilation (KLL 601),
the negro-spiritual has become
so much a part of the folksong
tradition of America that only
an expert on American folk-
music can be absolutely sure
which tunes Stephen Foster
wrote and which are spirituals.
This reviewer is no expert,
but he had no difficulty with
the first two numbers on the
disk—“ Swing Low, Sweet
Chariot” and “All God’s
Children Got Wings.” These
Were clearly spirituals, though
wasn’t it shoes God’s chillun
used to have?
The third track was
obviously Gershwin’s “Sum-
mertime,” but the list swore
it was “Sometimes I Feel Like
a Motherless Child,” which is
a title neither Gershwin nor
Foster would ever have per-
petrated no matter whether
they composed the music for it
or not.
Reviewer consoled himself
with the thought that Gersh-
win’s “Porgy and Bess”
probably owed a lot to spiri-
tuals, anyway, and he remem-
bered that the last time he
heard “Summertime” it was on
a Percy Faith recording and
that it was also Percy Faith and
his orchestra who were putting
all they had into “Jubilation.”
Clearly Faith and Gershwin
were equally to blame for the
reviewer’s mistake, also for
the fact that while pondering
this point he had missed “Little
David Play on Your Harp”
(he’d heard that harp vaguely
in the background), “It’s Me,
Oh Lord” and “Were You
There?”
Closer study of the bill-of-
fare showed that all 14 pieces
on the platter were spirituals
and that Mr. Burr had appar-
ently merely thrown-in Stephen
Foster’s name to trap the
unwary. All of which shows
that spirituals should be heard
and not seen.

Christmas Stocking
Latest Coronet release is
Season’s Greetings (KLP 822),
a collection of Christmas songs
and pieces by well-known
practitioners. It is rather like
a Christmas-stocking, filled to
the brim with a lot of light,
colorful stuff and one or two
solid objects.
It opens most promisingly
with a jangle of (pseudo)
church-bells and a bevy of
American youth (Mitch Miller
and the Gang) bursting into
the title-tune, the words includ-
ing such sentiments as “God
bless our sweethearts, God
bless our folks.”
On the next track Johnny
Mathis voices “What Child is
This” —the tune is “Green-
sleeves.” There must be scores
of versions of this melody;
actually, it needs no more than
a simple, faithful statement
with the tiniest of musical
accompaniments. Whether it is
justifiable to dress it up (as
here) with background descants
and special effects is at least
questionable; and Mathis,
while he projects his usual rich-
ness of tone, doesn’t seem as
much at home as with less
time-tested tunes.
But Bing Crosby, who so
suavely syncopates “The
Secret of Christmas,” resolves
most of these questions: he
suggests that the secret con-
sists of doing Christmas things
all year through, and he puts
it across so pleasantly and
plainly that you feel it’s a great
theory.
Straight on Bing’s heels
comes the Norman Luboff
Choir, first with a gentle
unaccompanied “First Noel,”
in which the only disconcerting
thing is “Israel” pronounced as
“Is-ri-el”; “Wassail, Wassail
all Over the Town,” an Eng-
lish traditional carol; a nice
lilting “God Rest You Merry,”
and a faintly disappointing
“Hark the Herald Angels Sing.”
It’s good to have unaccom-
panied singing, but “Hark the
Herald” is one carol which,
because of its rich harmonic
structure, just about yells for
accompaniment —a sparkling
stream of organ tone, prefer-
ably.
Percy Faith fills the last track
on the first side with a daring
adaptation of Handel’s Hallelu-
jah Chorus —daring principally
because there is no singing at
all, the voice-parts being taken
by strings and trumpets. It
boils-down, with a lot of reedy
simmering, to a carnival reduc-
tion of one of the most magni-
ficent choruses in “Messiah.”
Still, Mozart fiddled around
with the orchestration —a
regrettable but nonetheless
concrete precedent.
The second side opens with
Mathis singing “The Christmas
Song”—nostalgic with a beat.
The Hi-Lo’s induce a momen-
tary shiver in the “Star Carol,”
which opens with references to
a winter night; if you regard
this as merely another example
of snowstorm sentiment the
cooling effect isn’t so noticeable.
At any rate, this is an unusual
bit of harmony, and they sing
it well.
The next track is quite a
contrast: a vigorous “Twelve
Days of Christmas,” with the
words altered so as to come
from a savage—. “Twelve
tel-e-vision, ’leven missionary”
and so on, right down to
“Three dried squid, two
coconut.” Strictly for laughs ;
sung by Ed Kenney.
This is followed by Mitch
Miller’s version of “Adeste
Fideles,” neither better nor
worse than most other
versions ; Percy Faith has an
overstated “Silent Night” ; and
there are moments in Mitch
Miller’s rolling “Auld Lang
Syne” when you feel you’re
already at a Christmas-party.

SYDNEY
How to be in two places at once
was the chief problem in a week so
full of social activity, entertainment and
good works as to delight the heart of a
Pepvs. And with the holiday-feeling in
the air, and the weather suddenly be-
coming summery and benign, a real
spirit of carnival seemed abroad.
☆ ☆ ☆
A gay first-night ushered “The
Piccadilly Bushman” into the Theatre
Royal, and set everyone talking about
the effective backdrop of the harbor
and bridge. The raucous cries of sea-
gulls added a realistic touch and the
only thing lacking was a strong salty
breeze to blow through the theatre. In
the audience were visiting artist John
Laurie, Borovansky stars Christiane
Hubert, lovanka Biegovic, Rosalia
Kurowska and her husband, Frank
Bourman, Garth Welch and Paul Grin-
wis. Mr. J. B. Priestley was there;
Bettina Welch and her husband, Der-
mott O’Brien; and Margo Lee and her
husband, Frank Brooks. Desmonde
Downing, who designed the- set, received
many compliments at a party held after
the show.
One of the prettiest dresses was that
worn by Ingrid Doleman, the young
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Guy Doleman
(he’s the male lead in the play). It was
of blush-pink silk, with bouffant skirt
and balloon-sleeves. Mrs. Doleman was
in black silk faille ; also in black was
Mrs. Harald Bowden. Among the
younger theatregoers was Mrs. James
Macken, of Bellevue Hill, whose jade-
green satin frock was worn under a
velvet theatre-coat. With her was Mrs.
A. W. Salisbury, of Darling Point, and
Robert Meagher, of Double Bay. The
former looked elegant in a slim black-
satin dress and a satin-coat of turquoise-
blue and black. Mrs. Victor Dekyvere
v/as in smoke-grey chiffon, Mrs. Tom
Bateman in white lace over pale-pink.
Adding to the gaiety of the after-
show party was actress Ethel Gabriel,
back from four years or so in the cast
of “The Doll.” Also present were Mr.
and Mrs. lan Jacoby, Dr. and Mrs.
Richard Opie, Mr. and Mrs. Isaacs,
Mrs. Carl Wilson, Dr. and Mrs.
McDonald, C. Don Service, Janet
Bowen, Diane Hetherington, Mrs. John
Gray, Laurel Mathers, Mrs. A. H.
Chartres and Mrs. Stuart Ward. A silk-
dress of hyacinth-blue, patterned with
an Oriental design in lacquer-red, was
eyecatching on Mrs. Chartres ; and Mrs.
Ward was in white satin.

Then there was the glamorous gala
night at the Latin Quarter, when
consciousness of helping along the cause
of handicapped children added an extra
zest to enjoyment. It was organised in
co-operation with the management by
the social committee of the Royal N.S.W.
Institution for Deaf and Blind Children.
President Mrs. Bill White and hon.-
treasurer Mrs. P. Peacock Smith wore
happy smiles as they stood for a long
time near the entrance (which looks
like Aladdin’s cave, studded with gleam-
ing jewels and lit with rose-color) greet-
ing the long line of guests. Mrs. White
was a brilliant figure in a cocktail-dress
of lame, embroidered with gold and
pearls, and with gold-mesh gloves and
gold slippers* Mrs. Peacock Smith was
in a white silk ballerina-dress, patterned
with pink roses. Around the tables were
gay parties, which included guest-of-
honor Peter Graves, star of “Whip-
lash,” and his wife, with her aunt, Mrs.
Alexander ; Mr. and Mrs. Geoffrey See,
Mr. and Mrs. Roy Harrison, Mrs. M. A.
Aldritt and Mr. Richard Livingstone,
rock-and-roll singer Johnny O’Keefe, just
back from the U.S., and Norman Erskine.
Back in Sydney in time for warm and
sunny days (she hopes!) is actress
Aileen Britton, one of the stars of “The
Piccadilly Bushman.” As an Australian
married to an Englishman she naturally
wants all her claims for her native land
confirmed, and a harbor blotted-out by
rain isn’t much help. However, husband
John Huson is three-quarters Australian
already, he claims, and he has seen quite
a lot of the country since he appeared
( as Det.-Sgt. Pidgeon )) with his wife in
“Dear Delinquent.” Miss Britton had a
host of leading roles to her credit, in
“Blithe Spirit,” “The Man Who Came
to Dinner,” “My Sister Eileen” and
other plays, before she concentrated on
radio and TV, and followed that up
with a two-year tour of study through
Europe, with Britain and Scandinavia
included.
A guest-speaker with much appeal is
author, playwright and critic J. B.
Priestley. Through the week he spoke
to many audiences in Sydney, and won
them all. Even his preliminary approach
is fascinating. He carefully arranges a
water-jug and a filled tumbler near his
elbow, slowly takes-out and opens a
pocket-watch, which he props nearby.
Then, with the. grin of a Boy Scout
thoroughly prepared for all contin-
gencies, he launches into his discourse.
More than a thousand pairs of eyes
watched this. preparation with much
interest at the Art Gallery of N.S.W.
when Mr. Priestley spoke on “Theatre
Today” to members of the Art Gallery
Society and the Arts Council of Aus-
tralia. At this meeting, held in the main
gallery, with an overflow-audience stand-
ing round the doorways, Mrs. Priestley,
better known as writer Jacquetta
Hawkes, was charming in vivid flamingo
silk, over which she wore a balloon-
sleeved theatre-coat of black faille. Seen
in the audience were Mrs. Douglas
Dundas, Miss Dorothy Helmrich, Mr.
and Mrs. Walter Bunning, Mr. and Mrs.
Humphrey Henchman, Mr. Mervyn
Horton, Miss Vanessa Schneider, Mrs.
H. Odillo Maher and Mrs. David
Lindsay.

A subtle tribute was paid to women
by Lady Woodward at the 45th annual
general meeting of the N. S. Wales
division of Australian Red Cross when
she said that Lord Howe Island was
the only place she had visited on a
recent tour that had no Red Cross
branch. The reason was there weren’t
enough women there to form one, she
reported, adding that she hadn’t stayed
on the island long enough to establish
one.
The annual report, presented by divi-
sional chairman J. F. Clack, showed
that 45,804 new members had joined
Junior Red Cross, to make a total of
200,000 in the State. World-member-
ship of Red Cross is 128-million. The
meeting welcomed - home honorary
director of branches Miss Margaret E.
Waddell, just back from a world trip.
While in Iran Miss Waddell was 1 made
an hon. member of Iran Red Cross
(called the Red Lion and Sun). Guests
at the crowded meeting included Mrs.
T. Yuval, wife of the Minister for Israel.
Talking of Red Cross, music will fill
the air at lunch-time (from 12 till 2)
for visitors to Hyde Park and Wynyard
Park from the end of November until
December 4, when open-air concerts will
celebrate the close of the Red Cross
Centenary Year. Nationals of China,
Greece, Italy, India and Rumania will j
each have a day in which to present
the songs and dances of their country;
Australia will be represented by children
of waterside workers and by a group
of aboriginal children from La Perouse
school. There is enthusiasm aplenty
among the young artists. That there’ll
be fine weather is the fervent hope of
their elders.


MELBOURNE
Most of the week’s doings centred
round the Crippled Children and Adults
Appeal, which was opened with a heart-
warming speech by Sir John Latham.
Over 500 guests filled the Bamboo Room
of Chevron Hotel for the opening and
enjoyed a delectable supper, the gift of
the management. Before the evening
concluded the chairman was able to
announce that £21,000 had already been
subscribed. One of the functions planned
to raise money for the appeal is a
Bohemian-party on December 9.
Reminded by chairman Sir Clifden Eager,
Sir John recalled the days when he
belonged to Melbourne’s Bohemian Club.
This, he explained, had three types of
members, Bohemians, Be-homians and
Won’t-behomians.
Among those who enjoyed Sir John’s
speech were Archbishop and Mrs. J. J.
Booth, Sir Archie and Lady Michaelis,
Judge and Mrs. Norris, Sir Angus
Mitchell, Mr. Justice Sholl and Mrs.
Sholl, Mr. and Mrs. L. J. Dooling and
Mr. and Mrs John Dynon.

With the blue hills of the Dandenongs
as background, the luncheon-party held
in the garden of The Leastowes, home
of Mrs. H. A. M. Watson at Lysterfield,
was a great success. This party was to
assist the funds of the Victorian Society
for Crippled Children and Adults and
the chairman of the women’s group,
Mrs. Norman Welsh, was guest-of-honor.
Two-hundred guests were there, includ-
ing Lady Eager, Lady Upjohn, Lady
Dunstan, Dr. Deborah Buller Murphy,
Mrs. John Lawson, Mrs. A. Coffey and
Mrs. Violet Lambert.

A sudden burst of hot weather was
responsible for some glamorous dress-
ing on the opening night of “The
Gazebo” at the Comedy Theatre.
With fur-coats and -stoles discarded,
frothy white and colorful flower-patterned
frocks were worn. Mrs. Ronald Marriott
looked stunning in a white velvet
cheongsam, patterned in an all-over
design of tiny pastel-pink roses. With
Mr. Noel Burbank, Q.C., was his wife,
son and daughter. Mrs. Burbank chose
a sheath-frock of satin, patterned in
deep-red roses ; daughter Wendy wore a
short frock of white French lace, ruffled
from the bodice to the hem. A sheath
of white guipure-lace was chosen by
Mrs. Graham Nathan. With her hus-
band was Mrs. Ronald Nott, whose
bouffant frock was of filmy pink tulle
pin-spotted in white. Over her white
frock, patterned in green flowers, Mrs.
Garnet Carroll wore a theatre-coat of
lime-green silk-shantung, and Mrs.
Maurice Nathan’s black French-silk frock
featured a draped back cut to a deep
decollete. With Mrs. Gerard Osborne
was her pretty daughter Anne, her frock
a froth of white tulle and lace. In “The
Gazebo” Muriel Pavlow, who shares top-
billing with husband Derek Farr, wears
two very lovely short evening-frocks, a
day-dress, a suit and two bathrobes. All
were made locally and caused a lot of
comment.
With her husband and small daughter
Donna, Mrs. Sam Hunter, an American
with a most engaging personality, has
made her home in Kew. Born in Los
Angeles, the only daughter of Mr.
Harry Loeb and the late Mrs.
Loeb, Mrs. Hunter decided on leaving
school to make her career the
study of health and beauty. Her
husband, who was a few years ago
chosen as “Mr. America,” started the
health-salon known in the United States
as Silhouette International and the
couple have now opened in Melbourne
three figure-and-health salons where
women may have figure-defects cor-
rected. When she has time, Mrs. Hunter
enjoys golf, swimming and the theatre.
Next February she’ll be taking a trip
to visit her father in Los Angeles.
Shakspearian actor Allan Wilkie was
in the audience at the Little Theatre when
a gala premiere of “The Solid Gold
Cadillac” was given in aid of the appeal
for the Victorian Crippled' Children and
Adults. Also in the audience were Mrs.
Norman Welsh, whose party included
her two sons Max and M. B. Welsh and
their wives. Among others who enjoyed
the slick American comedy were Sir
Clifden and Lady Eager, Mr. and Mrs.
Peter Isaacson, Matron-in-Chief of the
Royal Australian Army Nursing Corps
Col. J. Bowe, Mr. and Mrs. Cedric
Paynter, Mr. and Mrs. Rae Featherstone,

A large and enthusiastic gathering in
the Town Hall reception-room heard
plans to celebrate the 25th anniversary
of the National Theatre Movement. An
Arts Festival will be held in March,
1960, at the St. Kilda Palais Theatre.
This will be the first Arts Festival
arranged by the National Theatre since
the Royal Visit Festival in 1954. Operas
to be presented are “Tosca” and “Aida”;
ballets will be “Les Sylphides,” “Swan
Lake” and “Le Coq d’Or.” The festival
will last eight days.

C. L. Desborough, of Corio. A gown
of magnolia-satin cut on princess-lines,
with the skirt extending into a train,
was worn by the bride. Her family-
heirloom veil was of fine Brussels lace
and tulle, caught by a halo of satin.
Scottish heather was mixed with fran-
gipani in the bridal bouquet. The bride's
sister, Mrs. Alistair Riddoch, was
matron-of-honor, and the bridegroom’s
sisters, Louise and Sarah, were also in
attendance. They wore frocks of almond-

Ross of the "New Yorker"
So much has been written and said
about Harold Ross that few people
interested in the American literary
scene of the ’twenties and ’thirties can
have failed to pick up some sort of
picture of him, usually as a rough-
looking, rude-talking, irascible, unrea-
sonable, heart-of-gold “character” who
always seemed more like the shiftless
hobo reporter he had been in his youth
than the founder and editor for 25
years of the urbane, witty and widely
informed “New Yorker.”
But none of the legends explain
what made him the great editor they
all say he was. Even Dale Kramer’s
full-length study of him, published
some years ago, didn’t go much
beyond a history of the magazine:
Ross was in it, all right, but rather as
a statue. It has been left to James
Thurber, who worked with Ross from
1927 until Ross’s death in 1951, to
make the facts move and breathe: his
The Years with Ross (Hamish Hamil-
ton), if it doesn’t completely resolve
the Ross enigma, is about as full and
living a portrait of the man as any
we are likely to get.
Of Ross’s apparent lack of wide
editorial background the stories are
abundant. Poorly educated, he was
sometimes startlingly uncertain of
literature, history and politics. He was
known to have asked people whether
Moby Dick was the whale or the man,
whether Marxism and Communism
were the same thing, and who William
Blake was; and although allowance
must always be made for a certain
perversity in any strange Ross action,
he always seemed genuinely impressed
when anyone could answer him. He
cared nothing for music, painting or
poetry, was filled with wonder by the
learning of his literary critics, and
seldom read anything other than his
beloved magazine.
Nor did he seem to have a remark-
ably acute natural intelligence. He
sometimes printed cartoons without
seeing what they meant or because he
mistook their obvious meaning com-
pletely. But perhaps his strangest
limitation was an inability to write
the kind of polished and flowing prose
he demanded from his staff (Thurber
describes how, after years of painful
effort, he gave it up in the early
’thirties and never tried it again).
All this might suggest that Ross had
a terrible struggle against his limita-
tions. On the contrary, he was neither
ashamed of them nor concerned with
trying to correct them. With a mind,
as someone once described it,
“uncluttered by culture,” he could give
a free run to the few but extraordinary
gifts and obsessions that were basic to
his success.
He had an enormous curiosity about
his surroundings and the people in
them; he loved accuracy, clarity, grace
and variety in writing; he had
astonishing powers of concentration;
and above all he had a unique intuitive
sense of prose values;—
Having a manuscript under Ross’s
scrutiny was like putting your car
in the hands of a skilled mechanic,
not an automotive engineer with a
bachelor of science degree, but a
guy who knows what makes a motor
go, and sputter, and wheeze, and
sometimes come to a dead stop ; a
man with an ear for the faintest
body squeak -as well as the loudest
engine rattle. When you first gazed,
appalled, upon an uncorrected proof
of one of your stories or articles,
each margin had a thicket of queries
and complaints—one writer got a
hundred and forty-four on one
profile.
He once reckoned that Thurber
must have dropped about eight lines
out of an item in his final rewrite of
it. Puzzled, Thurber checked his
next-to-last draft of the piece, and
“Ross had been wrong. I had dropped
only seven lines.”
Such a demanding and hair-splitting
character, with his “Fowler’s” and the
dictionaries that ' were among his
favorite reading, would probably have
driven all his writers mad or out if
he had not been able, through a rough
and strange personal charm, to draw
them into his obsessive search for
perfection. But draw them he mostly
did, and many of them, even some he
quarrelled with, have admitted that
they valued a Ross grunt of approval
more than most other kinds of praise.
At the Tuesday-afternoon cartoon
conferences Ross became, in Thurber’s
opinion, “by far the most painstaking,
meticulous .... detail - criticiser the
world of editing has known.” He also
revealed that behind his blasphemous
tongue lurked an almost old-maidish
prudery. “Sex is an incident,” he used
to say, and he was always afraid that
some artist was going to get a phallic
symbol or a double-meaning past him.
Several artists did both, of course,
including the famous Price, who drew,
from a childhood memory of his
doctor-father’s surgery, a double-spoon
curette as one of the instruments in an
operating-theatre cartoon.
The search for perfection extended
also, and with sometimes chaotic
results, into Ross’s attempts at organis-
ing his staff. For years he dreamed of
having
a Central Desk at which an in-
fallible omniscience would sit, a
dedicated genius, out of Technology
by Mysticism, effortlessly controlling
and co-ordinating editorial person-
nel, contributors, office-boys, cranks
and other visitors, manuscripts,
proofs, cartoons, captions, covers,
fiction, poetry and facts, and bring-
ing forth each Thursday a magazine
at once funny, journalistically sound,
and flawless.
This obsession led him into strange,
often perverse, mishandling of people.
One after another, brilliant men came
into the office, were overestimated,
shoved into the miracle-man chair,
asked to do more than they could,
quarrelled with Ross and left. A few,
like Thurber himself, managed to sur-
vive the chair, but over the years Ross
ran through some of the best editorial
minds in the country. Of course he
did not know what he was after, and
when he had the man for the job—
Ralph Ingersoll—he couldn’t resist
driving him to resign.
Ross’s relations with his business
department could only be described as
a cold war. In two of his most fascinat-
ing chapters Thurber describes Ross’s
financial life generally as “a com-
pound of fairytale, case - history,
double-talk and melodrama,” and
relates how he allowed a private-
secretary to defraud him of 71,000
dollars and once, on a whim, sold a
large parcel of “New Yorker” shares
to the proprietors of “Time.”
Still, with all his gifts, Ross, it must
be admitted, was remarkably lucky with
A SAILOR’S GRAVE
Shall I be buried at sea, or shall my bones
wait
Till the continents float apart, and at the
gate
Of my grave l hear the waves grinding
The granite back to sand, and feel the
blinding,
Stinging salt in the voids where my eyes
were once?
I, wearing that white cap, my skull,
a dunce,
Should read the portents of each feasting
tide;
Should watch the ravenous currents
devour the sand;
And I shall learn, high up on a mountain-
side
Is no safe place for a grave. What part of
land
That has not been the sea-bed? Then,
out to sea
Bury me with all sailors, and I shall have
Feel of that permanence that befits a
grave
With, ever, the wind and wave to moan
over me.
QUEENSLAND.

his writers. The “New Yorker” began
as a provincial and collegiate imita-
tion of “Punch” and very nearly died
in its first two years. Then, in quick
succession. E. B. White, Thurber and
Wolcott Gibbs came in from nowhere,
and the magazine never looked back.
Of course Ross attracted them, and
the host of first-raters who followed
them, by putting up the kind of maga-
zine best suited to their great talents,
and he was clearly a strong, catalyst
to all his writers. But he once said
that if ever Thurber, Gibbs and White
left he, Ross, would go too. He knew
that no editor could ever have hoped to
get such men so quickly when they
were most needed.
Thurber’s book, however, deals with
much more than Ross’s editing. It is
above all a record of what it was like
to be a friend of the man, an object of
his deep personal concern and over-
whelming generosity. It is a mosaic
made of countless anecdotes, some of
them crazily funny and all of them
suffused with Thurber’s feeling for the
man —the feeling he described, in his
dedication of “The Thurber Carnival”
to Ross, as “increasing admiration,
wonder and affection.”
"Strike Me Lucky"
Joy Cleary’s Strike Me Lucky (Ure
Smith Pty., Ltd.) is a lighthearted
novel about what happens in a modern
Australian country town, conveniently
located somew'here north of New-
castle, N. S. Wales, when people start
finding gold in their backyards.
Those most affected at Bulinga—•
Mr. Patch first discovered the gold
when he was digging a hole to bury
the bottles after the party when Matt
came home from jail—are Constable
Killalea, who likes to live at peace
and never arrests anybody if he can
help it; the priest, Father Hourigan,
who is a keen student of racehorses and
is put to some perturbations of
conscience when the gold-seam is found
to extend into the graveyard; Gina Da
Vinci, an extremely glamorous Italian
migrant who has ambitions to marry a
rich man; Annie Bloomingdale, a
travelling prostitute with a heart of
gold who is offered lodgings by the
spinster, Miss Holborn; and, princi-
pally, the Patch family, an oddly
assorted lot comprising, amongst
others, a stalwart Mum. a Rabelaisian
grandmother, a connection known as
the Town Drunk, a son who has been
to jail for assault and another son who
is the headmaster of the local school
—he falls in love with Gina and he
narrates the novel in the first-person.
Joy Cleary, who is Jon Cleary’s wife
(this is her first novel), may have had
her eye on the films when writing the
story, for it builds up into just the
sort of climax Hollywood likes, with
the schoolmaster and the glamorous
Gina dashing madly in an old Rolls
Royce from one public meeting to
another to cope with various uproars,
and with the Town Drunk at last
blowing-up the mine which has by then
run-out of gold.
It would have been better, really, if
Mrs. Cleary had kept her eye on Aus-
tralia in the way, say, that Chevallier
keeps his eye on France, for these
people are not very real, and, conse-
quently, are not profoundly comic. But
it could make a most diverting film,
and on its superficial level it reads
crisply and amusingly.
ON THE BEACH
Today beneath these joined she-oaks
where fondling shadows cross the sand
we learn the tidal shores of love and I
turn the sea in my surging hand
high-tide along your nervous land.
We are alone on this summer beach
in the she-oaks shadow, and explore
the wondering strangeness of two selves,
as the tide is foamed and awed before
the receiving wonder of the shore.
Dear, this is summer’s highest tide,
all seasons’ storm. But understand
the beach knows only the water’s edge,
and the sea is lost on the higher land —
though it strews from its deeps rare gifts
to the sand.

A Pinero Comedy
It is always a pleasure to meet
Pinero again, his bright small light still
shining bravely in his eclipse; and if
for some inexplicable reason Heine-
mann’s have put his Dandy Dick into
their Drama Library instead of the
much solider “The Amazons,” this
comedy is still a pretty fair substitute.
Pinero was, of course, more-or-less
run off the English stage by the plays
of Bernard Shaw, who. as some doubt-
ful compensation, as Denys Blakelock
reminds us in his foreword to “Dandy
Dick.” helped to get him his knight-
hood. Pinero’s comedies were not
supposed to have any “ideas” in them;
and Shaw’s did.
But Pinero did have at least two
ideas—that pretty girls were attractive,
and that laughter was worth while for
its own sake—and, if these were hardly
novel ideas, and lacked variety, they
were, and are, nonetheless valid and
pleasant. His women have a sort of
eager kittenishness about them which,
though the point could be argued,
makes them seem more alive than
W. S. Gilbert’s, and which is certainly
not to be found in the abstractions of
Shaw.
Some of Pinero’s plays are barely
readable, for they consist of not much
more than a set of stage-directions
telling the actors how to fall over each
other or pop into cupboards and under
beds at the right time to make a work-
able farce; but “Dandy Dick,” for-
tunately, is both readable and play-
able. It is about a dean who gets
tempted into backing a horse to get
£5OO to mend the church spire; and if
that sort of theme, though funny
enough when he gets arrested for try-
ing to poison one of the horses, seems
rather milk-and-watery today, there is
still a lot of life in the two eager
daughters who sneak out the window
to go to a ball with their military
lovers, and more solid life in the
dean’s horsey sister, whose literally
racy vocabulary—“ Well, Augustin, my
boy, it’s nearly twenty years since you
and I munched our com together”—
is very much like the mannish language
that makes the women in “The
Amazons” so amusing.

cost of trenching.
★ Greater strength gives far longer life.
★ Steel pipe does not deteriorate in
sunlight or with exposure.
★ Is not damaged by termites or
rodents.
★ Has much greater pressure capacity.
★ Steel pipe is easy to install, handle or
store without fear of breakage.
★ In-built structural strength and rigidity
permit overhead vertical and
building installations.
★ No other type of pipe is so
economical ... so enduring . . . SO
versatile in its application.
Why take risks with other fragile, easily damaged, shorter-lived types of piping!
