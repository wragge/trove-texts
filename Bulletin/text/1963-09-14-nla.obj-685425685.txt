National Notebook
Birth of a Salesman
A cry from the heart after hearing a
lecture on “The Secrets of Success-
ful Selling” by a visiting American Pro-
fessor of Marketing:
We all know about a Salesman's Death
But to be a salesman born
It seems he is dependent on
These Good Fairy gifts: Brea’th
Of mind, the ability to plan,
To be persuasive with his fellow man.
Honesty is there and keen endeavor
Loyalty, of course, acumen and drive.
These things can make the old firm live
_ forever
And keep the salesman’s sense of death
alive.
N.P.
The Letter of the Law
the police down South arrest
a Negro demonstrator and throw
him into gaol, at least he’s among friends.
When they pick up a white integration-
ist they toss him into the tank with the
bums and drunks and tell them, ‘Here’s
another one for you boys.’
That way the sheriff
doesn’t need to work him
over.”
That’s how actor-singer
Theodore Bikel, himself a
Viennese Jew, explained
it to us. Bikel was in
Sydney en route to the United States
after a concert tour in New Zealand.
Bikel is an authority. He has been
taking part in the anti-segregationist pro-
jects for some time now.
“Things are changing,” he told us.
“Only six weeks ago I took part in a civil
rights meeting in New Orleans. Do you
know that some of the biggest hotels in
New Orleans are booking in Negroes
now? That was unthinkable only a
short time ago.”
Bikel, who received an Academy
Award nomination for his role with Tony
Curtis and Sydney Poitier in “The Defi-
ant Ones,” says he remembers what it
means to be a second-class citizen. “To
be spat upon and beaten in Vienna under
a Nazi dictatorship is one thing, but when
similar things happen a generation later
in a democracy I don’t want to stand
idle,” he said.
The night before we had heard him
electrify a Sydney coffee-house where
local folk-singers gather. For two hours
he commanded silence in the crowded
room while he sang songs from Israel,
America, Britain, Russia and Paraguay.
Bikel told how he worked with the
student non-violence movement to urge
southern Negroes to appreciate the neces-
sity of getting a vote. “Integrating lunch
counters and transport facilities is all
very well, but the main thing is that
vote,” he said.
“On one occasion I drove through
Albany, Georgia — and that’s danger-
ous territory. There they run it all by
the book. There was a colored fellow
next to me and another white man next to
him in the front seat of the car. We
knew they were watching us all the way
and one false step, a traffic violation or
anything, and it was gaol with no bail.
They just throw you in and forget you
down there.
“The sheriff’s attitude depends a lot
on the national Press coverage. When
magazines like ‘Time’ are covering a
demonstration, they keep to the letter of
the law and if someone stands up, well,
the issue is interpreted according to the
law.
“We held a mass meeting in a big field
belonging to a Negro woman and the
sheriff came along and told her it was
illegal. ‘How come you’re interested in
my field now? You
weren’t interested last
year when it didn’t pro-
duce no crops. You just
show me the law that says
I can’t invite people in
here to meet and I’ll call
it off.’
“The sheriff then tried to get her to
stop cars driving on her land. If he
could have forced us to park outside on
the roadway he could have acted on an
obstruction. But she told him she didn’t
care if the automobiles rutted her field.
It was pretty bad, anyway. There wasn’t
anything the sheriff could do and 400 of
us met there in that old woman’s field.
But when the Press leaves then all hell
breaks out.
“Is there any change in the Southern
whites? Yes, I think so. The rabid
anti-segregationists are the upper upper
and the lower lower. The middle class
don’t seem to worry so much. You
take Ole Miss — the University of Mis-
sissippi; why there must be 20,000 stu-
dents there, yet only a handful took any
part in the demonstrations against Mere-
dith. The Ku Klux Klan and segrega-
tionist organisations rolled up in their
thousands, but the majority of the stu-
dents didn’t support them. Left to them-
selves they’ll talk, eat and get along
with a Negro student. Only if someone
makes an issue of it they drift away.
But those real poor whites. To them it’s
important to have someone lower than
themselves to look down on.’’

Pies at the Palace
Sydney’s forthcoming lunch-hour
theatre pies at the Palace has
got trade-union support. From September
26 audiences, for 3s. throughout the
house, will be able to see Edward Albee’s
40-minute one-acter, “The American
Dream.”
The public relations officer of the
Australian Council of Salaried and Pro-
fessional Associations, Mr J. S. Baker,
told us that his organisation’s interest in
the project stemmed from “our concern
that professional workers, such as actors
or artists, should be under-employed due
to TV and that office workers should be
under-employed by automation.”
He allowed that his organisation had
no part in the initial scheme, which came
from Professor Robert Quentin of the
Elizabethan Theatre Trust, which Actors’
Equity president Hal Lashwood had en-
dorsed. The plays will be presented in
association with Hoyts.
“We just got together,” he told us,
“and, of course it was a project that
attracted us. We asked all our affiliates
to support this by organising audiences.
“For our part we would like to see the
scheme develop to the same extent that
Centre Forty-two has in Britain. Over
there the TUC has supported festivals
of drama, music, folk songs and art.
Arnold Wesker is one of the sponsors
and it’s quite a driving force. Perhaps
we can achieve something like that. At
least we’d like to see folk-song concerts
between the drama shows.
“From there who knows where it may
go?”
He handed us a leaflet announcing in
part: “ . . . The hidden persuaders in
today’s conflict of ideas are mainly the
salaried and professional workers of
commerce, industry and the public
services.
“Whether it’s art or advertising, archi-
tecture or armaments, music or margins,
basic rhythm or basic wages, theatre or
TV, poetry or propaganda, white collar
workers will be in and around the pro-
ject on one side or another ...”
Try a Camel
Traders at the great camel market 12
miles outside Aden stopped amazed
in mid-haggle when an Australian, en
route to Europe, told them he had shot
as pests better camels than the ones they
were selling. Camels sold in the Aden
market at prices as low as £45 are still,
even in a free-port area where Mercedes-
Benz cars costing £2BOO in Australia
can be bought for £BOO, the ultimate
status symbol.
If the Minister for External Affairs,
Sir Garfield Barwick, wishes to become
the architect of a Pax Australiana he
could do worse than get together with
the Minister for Territories, Mr Paul
Hasluck, to have the wild camels of the
Northern Territory mustered for ship-
ment to Middle East countries. Not
American oil royalties plus air condition-
ing, not British oil royalties with Sand-
hurst cadetships thrown in, not gift-
wrapped Russian guns, could compete
with the presentation to every sheikh in
the Middle East of a Barwick’s
dozen of camels from beyond the black
stump.
This Week’s Cover
Artist Reg. Campbell left the snow
and ice of Sunny Corner, that ironic-
ally named spot in the ranges near Lith-
gow, NSW, to bring his portrait of Bob
Dyer in to us. Campbell is proud to
call himself a traditionalist, and is tra-
ditional enough in these days of jeans
and sweat shirts to wear a beret and a
beard.
His portrait of Dyer was entered in
the Archibald Prize competition, but
didn’t win. Campbell was not particu-
larly discouraged, but believes that within
a few years there will no longer be any
traditional portraits entered in the con-
test.
"Let me take over Bechuanaland, Basutoland
and Swaziland . . .
"And we shall lead them to independence,
prosperity and—er—freedom."


PLAIN ENGLISH
Policing the Police
INCIDENTS involving members of
the NSW Police Force in recent
weeks have again shaken public
confidence and given rise to doubts
as to the morale and proper ad-
ministration of the Police Force.
In the last two weeks there has
been evidence of police assaults on
arrested persons—in short, bash-
ings. One of them called forth an
acid comment by a Stipendiary
Magistrate in which he flatly called
two policemen liars. Then came a
third incident in which a constable
drew a revolver and fired two warn-
ing shots while, in the immortal
prose of a policeman describing the
event, “attempting to apprehend a
fleeing felon.” The felon in this
case was a mature criminal of fully
16 years, and the constable who
fired the warning shots said he fired
them into the ground, not into the
air. One of them, however,
damaged the boy’s lung.
The immediate response of the
Police Commissioner, Mr Allan,
was in all instances to order a
police enquiry—that is, an investi-
gating tribunal formed of police-
men, appointed by policemen, to
enquire into the actions of police-
men. If this is not asking for
a cynical public reaction it is hard
to know what would. Even harder
to follow is the Premier’s prefer-
ence for a police enquiry over that
of an independent tribunal despite
the immediate public suspicion that
the police case is so bad in each in-
stance it will not stand up to public
scrutiny.
Those favoring a police enquiry
into allegations against the police
doubtless have in mind that the least
said is the soonest mended, and that
while a public enquiry might clean
up bad elements in the police force,
it might also bring to light facts
tending to undermine public con-
fidence in the police. This may well
be so. But the fact remains that the
public would almost certainly prefer
an independent enquiry, guarantee-
ing not only that justice is done but
that it is seen to be done, than to sit
mum with the uncomfortable feeling
that a police enquiry into police
behavior may, just possibly, be
nothing else but a device for pro-
tecting the guilty.
ABC Not Controversial Enough
CONTROVERSIES about the
v>4 ABC run to a predictable
pattern. First there are regular
complaints about the ABC’s gut-
lessness; then suddenly the ABC
presents a programme that annoys
somebody, and demands for con-
trols and censorship are as loud as
former complaints about timidity.
Then there is a temporary return
to gutlessness and the cycle is re-
peated. This looks like happening
with the “Four Corners” pro-
gramme about the RSL, and it will
probably happen time and time
again. The general public can only
underline its hostility to the idea
of censorship and, while reserving
the right freely to criticise ABC
programmes, also urge the ABC
to stick to its guns.
But one other point must be
made. There is an ethics of con-
troversy and the producer has a
responsibility, in controversial pro-
grammes, to see not only that a line
of criticism is presented as strongly
as possible otherwise the pro-
gramme would be a bore but
that the line of defence or counter-
criticism is also presented as
strongly as possible otherwise
the programme becomes mere
propaganda. The plain fact is that
some of the ABC’s programmes
have come close to being mere
propaganda.
The one on the RSL is a case in
point. It was good to see a line of
criticism of the RSL being strongly
presented, but one waited in vain
for an equally vigorous counter-
attack. (The imagination boggles at
the thought that the producer tried
but failed to find people willing to
give the RSL’s critics as good as
they got.) Accordingly the pro-
gramme lost some of the respect of
those who began by admiring the
producer’s attempt to examine
controversial ideas.
A far worse case was the earlier
programme on Peace Movements
when the Soviet line was adopted
almost holus-bolus, and one waited,
again in vain, to hear an equally
vigorous criticism of the Soviet line.
In other words the trouble with
the “Four Corners” programmes is
that they are not controversial
enough. Indeed the producers avoid
real controversy on their program-
mes by giving unbalanced pictures.
The solution is not censorship
but more and better controversy.
Fascist Croats
TT is illuminating to find that
J- although The Bulletin first
drew public attention to the
Croatian fascist movement in Aus-
tralia in January, it was not until
a Communist dictator like Tito
laid his charges against it that some
people began to discuss the matter
seriously.
But most comment so far has
emphasised the responsibility of the
Immigration Department to keep
fascists out of Australia and of the
Security services to check on them
once they are here. Yet perhaps
the most serious aspect of the
whole story is the extent to which
this fascist group has been able to
hide behind fronts associated with
the Catholic Church, especially in
Melbourne.
One of the main leaders of this
Croatian group is a Croatian priest,
and one of its main organs is a
parish magazine. They attack
Croats who become naturalised or
marry Australians as anglophile
traitors, and they mix attacks on
Communists with attacks on Jews.
Catholics almost without excep-
tion abhor and fight against the
ideas of these fascists as indeed
do most Australian Croats but
Catholics also have the responsi-
bility to see that they no longer
hide behind church labels. Atten-
tion to this point will do more good
than any heavy-handed Govern-
ment intervention. a


THIS AUSTRALIA
FOREIGN POLICY
Four Ways to Help
East Malaysia
Where " T ” for Tobruk teas part of the flag
FROM K.G. TREGONNING
(Raffles Professor of History, University of Singapore)
DONALD STEPHENS
Hope
“Tf Australia can help us, I hope it will,”
said Donald Stephens (North Bor-
neo's Chief Minister) to me the other
evening. Australia has a rare oppor-
tunity, in the development of North
Borneo and Sarawak (East Malaysia) to
take a positive part in South - East
Asian affairs; and they are both small
enough (400.000 people in North Bor-
neo (Sabah), 700,000 in Sarawak) for
the sort of help Australia can give to be
immediately and visibly effective.
We have unique advantages particu-
larly in North Borneo. Although its
new State flag does not show it, its for-
mer flag, which depicted a trading
schooner, had the AIF 9th Division
shoulder flash, “T” for Tobruk, on its
sail. This indicated the affection held
for their Australian liberators from the
Japanese. This feeling persists. Borneo
is also the only part of South-East Asia
where there is a real awareness of Aus-
tralia. This asset should be utilised to
the maximum. In fact, it is ignored or
unknown. The recent visit of Austra-
lian politicians to South-East Asia, for
example, did not include Borneo, and
a good opportunity by Australia to build
on existing goodwill rare enough in
South-East Asia was lost.
Among the steps in East Malaysia that
Australia could take now are:
(1) Establish diplomatic and trade
posts there. East Malaysia has prob-
lems (and prospects) different from the
Malay Peninsula, and its leaders and
people are different. Australia can not
comprehend Borneo from Malaya, and
it should establish a post there to keep
itself informed of all this; and also to
inform East Malaysia of Australia.
(2) See about establishing a naval post
there. Sabah’s eastern seaboard is
plagued by pirates. There are not enough
patrol boats, defence of the island and
coastal kampongs is precarious, and
nothing would be more appreciated by
the Borneo people than an RAN frigate
on detached duty.
(3) Secure Malaysian approval for the
establishment of an Army unit there.
East Malaysia has a long future of border
raids ahead of it. In many ways this
will benefit the country, as it will help
to create a national spirit, but in other
ways these raids could be very dangerous.
Australian troops, now in a base camp
in Malacca, should go to East Malaysia.
(4) Investigate ways in which Australia
could concentrate its educational and
economic aid on East Malaysia. Colombo
Plan aid is spread so thinly that its im-
pact is negligible over most of South-East
Asia, but East Malaysia is small enough
for educational and other aid to be
effective. Its glaring problem is in com-
munications. It needs roads, therefore
it needs trained engineers, earth-moving
machines and trained operators; and
more schools with trained teachers.
The major Asian effort of young Aus-
tralians, it seems to an overseas observer,
is to agitate for unrestricted Asian emi-
gration to Australia. These efforts are
very largely irrelevant, for settling in
Australia is not a great Asian dream,
and their efforts do little to solve the
problems of South-East Asia. Rather
than trying to share their life with Asians,
they should come and help in the lands
where most Asians want to live.
(The picture of Mr Stephens above
comes from Ronald McKie’s book
"Malaysia”.)
HOUSING
Playford Plays for Time
Uncle Toni’s Cabins
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
I was in Adelaide last week to
look into the housing situation, it
was appropriate to find Sir Thomas
Playford in the thick of his most
dangerous Parliamentary situation yet
and pulling a rabbit or two out of the
SA Housing Trust’s hat to confuse his
critics.
On the eve of Sir Thomas bringing
down his 25th consecutive Budget, and
incidentally the State’s first to top the
century (in millions) mark, the death
of Mr Jennings, the LCP Member for
Stirling, deprived the Government of its
single vote majority (that is, in the
absence of an ALP Member, Mr Riches
overseas). Only the casting vote of the
Speaker enabled the Government to get
the Budget debate adjourned until after
the Stirling by-election on September 28
when it confidently expects a favorable
result, thus making numbers even again
with the return of Mr Riches on Sep-
tember 17.
But Sir Thomas is not only fighting
for power in Parliament. He also puts
himself once a week on two Adelaide
TV stations to address the people. On
each occasion to date he has managed
to produce new evidence to bolster his
man-of-action image, albeit some are
inclining to think this is losing a little of
its old force. No other Australian
Premier has so far elected to take a
similar risk.
Certainly one of the strongest features
of the Playford Administration over the
years has been the success of the South
Australian Housing Trust whose achieve-
ments have gained Australia-wide recog-
nition, mainly because of the huge
success of its satellite city of Elizabeth
17 miles north of Adelaide and latterly
with the introduction of the Trust’s
rental - purchase housing scheme pro-
viding the cheapest form of housing in
the Commonwealth.
Yet although Playford has nurtured
the Trust both with loan funds and other
support during its 27 years, it is not, in
fact, a Government institution. It is
rather a statutory body deriving its
functions from an Act of Parliament
in 1936 and only subject to Government
audit. It is virtually independent, there
being no Minister or Department of
Housing in South Australia.
In fact South Australia’s Mr Housing
is sixty-three-year-old Jack P. Cartledge,
former Parliamentary draftsman and

barrister, who has been Chairman of the
Housing Trust practically as long as his
friend “Tom” has been Premier. Clearly
a key man in the Premier’s calculations,
he told me he works in perfect harmony
with the present Government and would
do the same with any alternative one.
Obviously the Trust’s tie-in with the
Government is very close indeed, so it
was not all that surprising, at the height
of the political crisis last week, that Sir
Thomas turned to Cartledge for a talk-
ing point for his TV session (this was
in process of being fixed up while I was
interviewing him).
Oddly enough the point was not con-
cerned with either of Mr Cartledge’s
two main brain children, Elizabeth or
the rental-purchase scheme (which is
now well in motion with the completion
of 20 houses and 1300 under contract,
and will be the subject of an article
in next week's Bulletin), but the
announcement of a decision to close
down the Gepps Cross Migrant Hostel
and the erection of 300 Housing Trust
houses on the 72-acre site.
The Premier claimed that there had
been such a “tremendous” change for
the better in South Australia’s housing
position in the last ten years that a
hostel was no longer needed. Un-
fortunately few other States could take
similar credit.
From all accounts this hostel hasn’t
been a “happy” one from the outset.
After many complaints, particularly
from British migrants, the Housing
Trust had converted it into a temporary
housing project—a purpose it has been
serving since 1952, providing migrants
with low-rental housing while they
look for permanent dwellings.
As a matter of fact a large number
of huts at this hostel are unoccupied and
there is also accommodation to spare
at the State’s other three hostels at
Smithfield, North Glenelg and Finsbury.
Even so it is goirjg to take three years
to demolish the camp at Gepps Cross
and probably even longer than that for
the Housing Trust to erect 300 new
houses there at a cost of £1,250,000.
CIVIL RIGHTS
The Case Against
the Police
Rumors and smears
FROM RICHARD HALL IN SYDNEY
N. ALLAN
The image
observers of the Sydney scene
would deny that the new Police
Commissioner, Mr Allan, has done much
to promote a better image of the Force.
But by the end of last week this image,
although not shattered, was tattered and
frayed.
A few days saw the appearance of two
serious bashing charges against police
force members. In one a magistrate
rejected police evidence and dismissed
a charge after hearing a claim from the
defendant, with some medical evidence
in support, that he had been beaten up
at an inner city police station. Then four
young men alleged that one of their
number was beaten up after a fracas in
a Chinese cafe. Here again there was
medical evidence of injuries.
A day later a 17-year-old youth was
shot down in a chase after an alleged
car theft. Then there was a report of
a tape-recording of a conversation be-
tween a prostitute and detectives being
submitted to the Commissioner. Then
still in the background was the unsettled
claim by the persistent Mr K. Buckley,
the University lecturer, who claimed
stand-over tactics by police at a party
in Kings Cross last February, and who
announced last week that plans are afoot
to form a civil rights organisation to re-
ceive and check on allegations against
the police.
At the end of last week one civil ac-
tion had been set in motion and another
was pending. The final end of at least
several of the matters could possibly
come only in the courts in a few years’
time.
One aspect of the matter that passed
without comment has been the apparent
use by some interested parties of rumor
and smear as a tactic to discredit those
who complain. A big city is likely to be
swept with sudden rumors starting from
no discernible source for example
the recurrent “Menzies-is-dead” rumors.
But, in these recent matters, rumors have
from the start been persistent in Sydney
about the character of some of the com-
plainants.
This is an old Sydney tradition. Over
the years suggestions have been made
that complainant X is a homosexual
and so is Y; or that Z is a Communist;
or that the whole protest is a newspaper
plot against the police, etc.
At Parliament House rumors have
been used even by one senior Cabi-
net Minister as arguments to ridicule
the veracity of some complainants. They
could even be said to have been success-
ful in dampening down some Parlia-
mentary discussion of the charges.
In this climate the essential question
of principle, on how persons in custody
should be treated, is in danger of being
ignored. Rumor and behind-the-scenes
allegations tend to suggest that there
are classes of people who deserve any-
thing they get.
Nobody seems to be making the
simple point that beating people up is
wrong, whether or not they are deviates,
Communists, former convicts, or for
that matter innocent.


LIBERALS v. COUNTRY PARTY—I
McEwen’s Brinkmanship
The Country Party Wants More
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
R. HOLTEN
Immunity?
Liberal-Country Party rela-
JL tionships have entered a new phase
since the NSW Liberals decided not to
contest any Country Party-held NSW
Federal seats and to stay out of Cowper,
the birthplace of so many CP traditions.
Whereas previously CP Federal leader
John McEwen was conducting savage
guerrilla operations against the long-
term threat of absorption by his Liberal
allies on a scale sufficiently large to
suggest that they might ripen at any
minute into the formal warfare which
could split wide open the Menzies
Liberal-CP coalition Government, he
now is engaged in brinkmanship.
McEwen has other objectives beyond
the formidable list he has already
achieved. He has succeeded so far in
(1) preventing an electoral redistribution
that would have eliminated two CP seats
and probably eliminated the CP repre-
sentative in a third; (2) persuading (or
intimidating) the Liberals into not con-
testing any CP-held seat in Queensland;
(3) keeping the Liberals out of CP-held
seats in NSW; and (4) securing from the
Liberals a tacit acknowledgment that
until after the next Federal elections at
least Cowper (held by Mr F. McGuren
for Labor in the present Parliament, but
previously the personal citadel of CP
giant the late Sir Earle Page from 1919
to 1961) is to be regarded as exclusively
CP territory as far as the non-Labor
groups are concerned.
McEwen was prepared to smash the
now 14-year-old Menzies Government
to get his way on these things. He is
still not satisfied. He wants more. What
he appears still to want is:
• The Liberals to leave the field to
a lone CP candidate against Mr Fuller,
despite the Liberal decision to contest
Hume (now held by Mr A. Fuller for
Labor but CP-held in the last Parliament.
• The Liberals not to run a candi-
date against Mr Hugh Leslie, who holds
Moore as the CP’s sole Western Aus-
tralian representative in the House.
• Immunity from Liberal attack in
Victoria for Mr R. Holten (Indi) and
Mr R. King (Wimmera).
® Some finality on the electoral re-
distribution issue.
Of those four I would pick the second
as the most important one from Mc-
Ewen’s viewpoint. Leslie, a one-legged
Tobruk veteran, represents the CP’s only
Western Australian toehold in the House
of Representatives. This alone makes
him important as far as McEwen and
the CP are concerned. But there is
another factor. Three-cornered con-
tests between a Labor candidate and
candidates from each of the two major
non-Labor parties are not nearly as
dangerous to Liberal-CP relationships in
seats which Labor can win as in seats
which Labor cannot win.
For example, Labor can win Hume.
It has demonstrated so repeatedly since
the seat was set up in the electoral re-
organisation of 1949. Mr Fuller has
since then been in and out of the House
of Representatives election after election,
almost as regularly as the man in a
weather clock on a showery day.
Consequently, the first aim of the two
non-Labor candidates is to beat Mr Ful-
ler. There is no sense in them belabor-
ing each other only to find that Mr Fuller
has finished up an easy winner. In such
seats the tendency of the non-Labor
candidates is to work together more.
But in a seat like Moore in Western
Australia Labor cannot win. Labor pre-
ferences, however, decide which of the
two non-Labor candidates is going to
win. It then becomes more important
for the candidates to fight each other
than to fight Labor. This leads to bad
feeling, which Labor exploits, and the
repercussions are Commonwealth-wide.
McEwen will probably put on a bit of
an act about Hume. But it will be an
act Hume will not be nearly as vital as
Moore. He is also a bit jammed on
Indi and Wimmera. While he is demand-
ing protection for the present incum-
bents of those seats Holten and King
he has not a leg to stand on historic-
ally. Holten and King won the seats by
beating sitting Liberal members.
He seems to be philosophical about
the fourth issue getting an agreement
with the Liberals on the electoral redis-
tribution issue. He set out wanting to
preserve the two CP seats recommended
for extinction by the Electoral Commis-
sioners and to obtain a quo.a loading in
favor of rural as against urban elector-
ates so as to maintain the adequacy of
rural representation in the House of
Representatives.
He achieved the preservation of the
two threatened CP seats when the CP, as
the balance of power between Liberal
and Labor in the House, enforced the
withdrawal of the Electoral Commission-
ers’ recommendations, which favored the
Liberals. McEwen can go on pre-
serving these seats as long as the CP
holds that balance of power in the House.
COURT "NEWS"
80 Years Ago: September 15, 1883
Tn Victoria a man is fined 10s. for
tying up a horse and beating it to
death. In N.S.Wales a journal has to
pay £2OOO for telling the truth. The
question why Victorian horses should
be 4000 times more badly protected
than NSW asses is coming to the
front.
Toadyism, like hope, springs eternal
in the human breast. Cut off one
head, and half-a-dozen others fill its
place. The news that the Begum of
Stinkamalee gave birth to another
“princess” to be dow'ered by the State
to swell the list of Royal mendi-
cants who would not touch with their
fans the hands that feed them—must
interest some classes in Australia, or
it would not be sent here. Under-
lying the element of tomfoolery in all
this, there is one of sadness. It is sad
to think that there are men and women
amongst us who, if they had their
way, would introduce all the worn-
out shams which have done so much
to keep nations in swaddling clothes
when they might have had their hands
on the plough of progress. Of those
who, by their writings or publications,
pander to this ignoble passion for
stars, garters, court-circulars, knee-
breeches, white wands, silk-stockings
and mummery, we do not intend to
speak. We might say too much.

They will probably be preserved by
statutory enactment soon anyway, when
the Electoral Representation Act is
amended to prevent a reduction in the
size of the House of Representatives
while the population is expanding. Once
this amendment is through McEwen and
the CP do not mind an election on the
present electoral boundaries. The 1961
election figures suggest that the CP would
not lose anything further, even if feeling
was running against the Government.
It is the Liberals who want and
need a redistribution.
LIBERALS v. COUNTRY PARTY—It
Cutting Liberals Down
to Size
How it is done in the west
FROM A PERTH CORRESPONDENT
C. NALDER
Without precedent
“Where's Chicken?” cried Labor mem-
"" bers as the West Australian Legis-
lative Assembly divided to vote on an
amendment to the Address-in-Reply last
week.
The man they called chicken fox
may have been a better word was
George Cornell, Country Party member
for Mt Marshall and the mover of the
motion on which they were voting. The
reasons why he moved the motion but
was absent for the vote show the deli-
cacy (or indelicacy) of Liberal Party-
Country Party relations in WA.
The story started the week before when
in the general confusion of subjects tra-
ditional to the Address-in-Reply, Mr
Cornell chose to attack the intrusion of
foreign capital. He quoted at length
from a Bulletin article, threw in some
of Mr McEwen’s recent forebodings and
wound up his speech by suddenly moving:
“The House wishes to express concern
at the increased volume of overseas in-
vestments introduced for the sole pur-
pose of taking over established Australian
enterprises and industries.”
As soon as he sat down, Crawford
Nalder, the head of the Country Party
in WA and acting Premier during the
overseas visit of Premier Brand, ad-
journed the House and members trooped
into the bar to discuss a situation with-
out precedent in the West Australian
Parliament.
By moving his motion during the
Address-in-Reply, Mr Cornell had
chosen a traditional method of censuring
the Government. In addition, if he
voted for his motion, there would be a
majority of one in its favour and the
Government would be defeated.
When the House met again the fol-
lowing week, Mr Cornell sought leave
to withdraw his motion. Naturally, the
Opposition refused leave and when no
Government member rose to second Mr
Cornell’s motion, Opposition Leader Bert
Hawke obligingly stood up. From then
on, it was a foregone conclusion.
Labor treated it as a fuli-scale debate,
the Government confined itself to a
couple of speakers. When the vote came
on Mr Cornell was not in the House
and he did not return for it. The result
was a 21-21 tie, with Liberal Speaker
John Hearmann clinching it for the
Government with a casting vote.
On the face of it, particularly in view
of his air of surprised innocence, Mr
Cornell’s abortive motion looked like
the work of an inexperienced parlia-
mentarian who could be trusted not to
embarrass the Government again. This
hypothesis ignores the fact that Mr Cor-
nell has been in Parliament 15 years,
has been a Cabinet Minister, and is one
of the shrewdest men in the Assembly.
But the real point is that he is a known
critic of the Liberal Party’s encroachment
into areas which he regards as natural
Country Party territory for example,
Darling Range, which Liberal Kenneth
Dunn won from the Country Party. He


once described his own Country Party
as becoming a “doormat” for the Liberals,
and would certainly believe in reminding
the Liberals how much they depend on
the Country Party.
There is no evidence that Mr Cornell
is likely to push the Government into
defeat, but he can cause it acute em-
barrassment by cutting them down to
size.
EDUCATION
Teachers’ Trade Unions
at War
“ Unjust , unfit , incompetent ”
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
J. BLOOMFIELD
Persuasion
'lJictoria’s rival teachers’ organizations
" are again at loggerheads over the
teachers’ tribunal the body which
fixes salaries and conditions for all
teachers in the State’s primary, second-
ary and technical schools. The Victor-
ian Teachers’ Union with 22,000 mem-
bers considers with some justification
that it fathered the tribunal, but the Vic-
torian Secondary Teachers’ Association
(about 3,000 members) has attacked it
as “an unjust, incompetent body, unfit
to control the conditions of teaching in
this State.” They are strong words but
they are from the preface of a 16-page
booklet issued by the VSTA in a renewed
campaign to have its grievances rectified.
The tribunal not only fixes teachers’
salaries: it also controls promotions and
handles disciplinary questions in the
education department. Prior to its estab-
lishment in 1946, teachers were under
the control of the Public Service Board.
Since the 1920 s the VTU had agitated
for a separate tribunal and when one
was set up the union regarded it as its
greatest single achievement. The cam-
paign for the tribunal involved the VTU
its boldest venture into State politics.
This was in 1945 when it threw its
weight behind ALP candidates in
key electorates, with some apparent
effect. The Cain Labor Government re-
sulted and the new Minister for Educa-
tion, Hon Frank Field, later acknow-
ledged the part the teachers played in
having Labor elected.
The tribunal is a full-time body and
sits under an independent permanent
chairman. The occupant since 1954, has
been Mr L. F. C. Garlick, one-time
Labor MLA for Mildura and a former
school-teacher. The other two members
are a Government representative, ap-
pointed for three years, and a teachers’
representative elected for a similar period
by all classified teachers. Mr R. H.
Jennings, formerly accountant of the
Education Department, holds the Gov-
ernment seat, while the teachers’ delegate
is Mr D. R. Brown, who has been on
the tribunal since its inception. Mr
Brown is a former primary teacher and
is a member of the VTU Council. His
tribunal membership strengthens the im-
pression in the VSTA that the tribunal
is loaded against secondary teachers.
About 80 per cent of the State's pri-
mary teachers belong to the VTU and
they form the vast bulk of its member-
ship. The VTU has only 2600 second-
ary teachers in its ranks, while the
VSTA with 3000 has over half the State’s
total, including 75 per cent of those
classed as permanent.
VSTA was formed in 1948 by
secondary teachers who believed that
their higher qualifications entitled them
to better salary margins than those paid
to primary and technical school teachers.
Many secondary teachers belong to both
unions, but as the Association has grown,
so too has its dissatisfaction with what
it sees as the domination of the tribunal
by the VTU.
At tribunal hearings, the VTU is the
only teachers’ body allowed to appear
with salary claims or representations on
conditions. It made this decision in
1956, although in 1959 the Minister for
Education, Mr Bloomfield, persuaded it
to let the VSTA send a representative to
state a supplementary case to salary
claims lodged by the VTU. However,
neither the tribunal nor the VTU would
give the VSTA a copy of the salary
claims under consideration. In this
situation the VSTA, even with the aid of
a Queen’s Counsel it had engaged, was
at a huge disadvantage. Its own claims
were rejected and soon afterwards the
tribunal announced it would no longer
allow counsel in.
The VSTA’s carefully prepared pamph-
let details these and other acts of dis-
crimination by the tribunal. It claims,
for example, that “although member-
ship should be one of the main bases on
which the tribunal decides which organi-
sations to recognise, it has never asked
for the VSTA membership figures.”
The fact that tribunal hearings are now
conducted in private has led the VSTA
to comment that this gives the VTU
opportunity to present, in secret, salary
claims loaded against secondary teach-
ers.
The suspicion is more than justified
by the fact that for many years the VTU
opposed a margin for secondary teachers.
It no longer opposes the margin (deemed
to be insufficient by the VSTA) but its
policy is to work for higher allowances
for qualifications, irrespective of whether
primary, secondary or technical teachers
are involved. However, on their general
estimate of the relative worth of primary
and secondary teachers, the two bodies
are poles apart.
The VSTA campaign against the tri-
bunal has put the Government in a cleft
stick. To interfere with the tribunal
could once again swing the VTU into
campaigning for the ALP. To let the
status quo continue means antagonising
the growing and vigorous VSTA, which
might also decide to take a hand in poli-
tics, although it has not yet hinted at
such a course.
The VSTA not only wants the right
to be heard by the tribunal, it wants
radical reorganisation of the body itself.
It is asking that a judge be appointed
as chairman and that there be three
teacher-representatives from the pri-
mary, secondary and technical divisions.
It also wants the tribunal to operate in
public and its records be made available.
Three teachers’ representatives would
mean three from the Government also,
and this could make the tribunal an un-
wieldy body.
However, some Victorian wages’
boards have multiple representation to
deal with industries where there are com-
peting unions the Hospital Employees’
Board, for example, has four union and
four employers’ delegates. The teachers’
tribunal, however, is a full time body.
One solution which has not been aired
is that there be a separate tribunal for the
secondary teachers, and possibly a third
for the technical schools. This might
be the Government’s best course.

CENSORSHIP
The “Oz” Affair
£20 per editor
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
ON April Fools’ Day this year an Aus-
tralian version of the English
satirical magazine “Private Eye” was
launched. Called “Oz,” its first issue
contained a satire on the recent Royal
tour, a send-up of Sydney’s socialites, an
extract from Queensland Hansard which
contained quotations from a talk by Dr
Peter Kenny on “Are Morals Out-
dated?”, a factual report on abortion,
and an historical article on chastity belts.
Distributed by girls from the Uni-
versities it sold 6000 copies on the first
day, and another 1000 were quickly
printed. Four issues have appeared al-
together (average sales 8000, possibly
helped along by favorable publicity on
the ABC-TV programme “The Critics”).
Since its editors are students (Richard
Neville in Arts, Richard Walsh in Medi-
cine), readers will have to wait until
after the annual examinations for the
fifth issue.
Last week, however, the editors were
fined for publishing obscene matter in
terms of the NSW Obscene Publications
Act. The charge referred to the first
issue only. Since the editors pleaded
guilty, there was little argument. The
Police Prosecutor, Sergeant Roy Turner,
was in an amiable mood as he described
the Hansard article as one of the worst
of its kind, and referred the magistrate
to the stories on abortion and chastity
belts. The magistrate then adjourned to
read the issue, stayed away an hour and
a half, and returned to comment that it
had little to recommend it. He fined the
editors £2O each.
LUNACY
Wrongful
Detention
A new tribunal
FROM A BRISBANE CORRESPONDENT
TPhe State Country-Liberal Government
will introduce legislation in the
Queensland Parliament soon to provide
for the establishment of a Mental Hy-
giene Tribunal claimed to be the
first of its kind in Australia. Under the
new regulations, any patient or relative
or any authorised person would be able
to appeal to the tribunal against alleged
wrongful detention in a mental hospital
or, as the regulations will call it, “special
hospital.”
The first tribunal is being planned for
Brisbane, but there are likely to be
others soon afterwards on the Darling
Downs and in North Queensland. Three
members would be appointed to the first
tribunal. The Health Minister (Dr Win-
ston Noble) has said that retired Queens-
land Judge B. H. Matthews is willing
to be chairman. A medical man and a
woman are also expected to be on the
tribunal.
Another proposed amendment to the
Mental Health Regulations will provide
a wider range of official visitors to the
mental patient. Official visitors have been
restricted mainly to visiting magistrates.
It is expected that under the new laws,
qualified psychiatrists and others experi-
enced in mental health work will make
regular calls to mental institutions. They
would have right of entry at all times.
It was also announced last week that
work would begin in early 1964 on build-
ing in Brisbane the nation’s first public
hospital exclusively for mentally ill
children.

OUT AND ABOUT
The Bob Dyer Story
An ambition to edit a Ben Chifley film biography
By BARRY JONES
My first appearance on “Pick-a-Box”
was in June, 1960, when the show
was on at 7 p.m. Saturdays. At
the beginning of the financial year 1961-
62 “Pick-a-Box” moved into the 7 p.m.
Monday time-slot.
It took nearly 18 months of writing
letters, which grew progressively ruder, to
get myself on the show. I had been dis-
illusioned by several years in business
and joined the Victorian Education De-
partment in 1957 at a salary far
below adequate, even though I was un-
married. After the 1958 Federal elec-
tion, in which I polled nearly 14,000
votes for the ALP in the Liberal seat of
Isaacs, there was an enormous campaign
debt of over £250. Since there was no
sign of a spontaneous mass movement to
relieve the candidate of this debt, “Pick-
a-Box” seemed one of the few legal ways
in which I could raise a few hundred
pounds fairly quickly.
I was not a regular viewer of the show
but on the nights 1 had watched my scores
had generally been ahead of the com-
petitors. Nevertheless there was a long
wait before being interviewed for selec-
tion. I wrote polite letters, plaintive
letters, registered letters, certified letters,
rude letters and peremptory letters (none
of them acknowledged) until I was called
in for an interview by one of Bob Dyer's
assistants only two days before I re-
corded my first show,
J don t think that he cared for me
much in those first shows. Bob used to
run “Pick-a-Box” strictly for laughs, with
a very rapid turnover of contestants,
The questions were not very exacting and
the answers often imprecise but this
seemed less important than the bonhomie
of the compere and the enjoyment of the
contestants, regardless of whether they
staggered away with a 144-piece setting
of English Tuscan bone china or a booby
prize, such as a packet of pumpkin seeds
or rubber bands.
Instead of giving the short and more-
or-less precise answers that were par for
the course, I showed an early tendency
to argue about lack of precision in the
questions. For example, in my second
show he asked the name of the battle
fought “on the Plains of Abraham in
1739”. I corrected him at once, point-
ing out that the Battle of Quebec (it
could hardly have been anything else)
had occurred in 1759, during the Seven
Years’ War.
Before long he overcame his feeling
that I was trying to score off him, realis-
ing that my supplementary answers were
not assumed for show business purposes.
I really did (and do) talk like that. He
then encouraged me (off the show) to
add relevant details. Initially viewers
resented me but soon fan mail and but-
ton-holing by strangers in the street in-
dicated sympathy for my didactic
methods in answering.
In July, 1960, Somerville Smith’s
“Newsletter” denounced me as a “top-
level Communist agent” and suggested
that Bob Dyer was subsidising me
through “Pick-a-Box” either because he
was a fellow traveller or wanted a free
trip to Moscow. While it was flattering
to join the great names slandered by Mr
Smith (subsequently imprisoned for cri-
minal libel later in 1960), I was fearful
of being eased off the show. Bob un-
hesitatingly accepted my assurances of
hostility to Communism which I was
able to document convincingly and no
more was said.
“Who was the first British Governor-
General of India?” This question mark-
ed a turning point in “Pick-a-Box” and
made me realise Bob Dyer's genius (it is
nothing less at times) as a showman and
his capacity for adaptation. For the bene-
fit of academics, journalists (especially
TV writers) and lawyers who don’t watch
the show, the “Governor-General” inci-
dent occurred in August, 1960. Margaret
Smith, a Sydney BA, answered “Hast-
ings”, which was the answer Bob wanted.
If Miss Smith was right and I had been
wrong then our scores for the round
would have tied 4-all.
I was almost certain that Bob required
“Warren Hastings” as the answer but
I was stubbornly determined not to give
that answer. When I was still at school
I had been given a Warren Hastings let-
ter and had been disappointed to read in
a contemporary biography that although
he was popularly called Governor-
General of India his correct title was
Governor-General of Bengal in India —-
because at the time of his administration
(1773-84) Britain only controlled a small
part of the sub-continent.
On the show I argued vociferously that
the answer was certainly not Warren
Hastings (this was before Bob read it
out). It could have been Earl Canning
(1858-61), the first Governor-General
(and Viceroy) after the last Indian Em-
peror died and the administration of all
India was taken away from the East'lndia
Company and given to the British
Crown. Alternatively it could have been

Earl Mountbatten (1947-48) alter the
title of Viceroy had been abolished.
At this point Bob couid have choked
me off, ruled that the round was drawn
and resolved the tie in the next round.
The incident would have been forgotten.
But he saw that I had studied the mat-
ter and decided that this recherche piece
of knowledge was worth arguing about
in fact that all knowledge, if it is
only examined intensively, is worth
brawling over if it will interest people and
make them realise that searching for
truth, even of a remote historical fact,
is worthw'hile.
When I flew to Sydney for the next
show Bob had arranged a special set and
a panel of three experts (A. G. L. Shaw
and Marjorie Jacobs of the Sydney Uni-
versity, and H. A. Sujan, Trade Commis-
sioner for India). We debated the issue
very fully (with no commercials inter-
rupting) for thirty minutes and agreed
at the end that the title of first Governor-
General of India belonged to Lord Wil-
liam Cavendish Bentinck, a liberal mind-
ed political hack who had the title con-
ferred on him by statute in 1833. He
scrapped the question and I won the
round.
/Contrary to popular belief my wife and
I don’t know Bob and Dolly Dyer
very well. We live in different cities,
of course, and only meet to record batches
of “Pick-a-Box” shows. I have visited his
home thrice —each time for Press recep-
tions, one in 1960, the others in Febru-
ary and June, 1963. Obviously any
intimacy between us would immediately,
and understandably, cause viewers to
suspect collusion.
Bob is astonishingly reticent for a
showman and it has taken several years
of questioning to piece together material
about his early life. He was born in
Hartsville County, Tennessee, “half-way
between Hartsville and Lebanon, near
Nashville, the state capital", at the end
of the first decade of this century. His
parents still live there. Bob started school
at six, and left high school aftei two years
when he was 16 to go into show business
the only career that ever interested
him. He had become involved in school
plays and “doing a magic act and playing
the ukulele. I became so interested in
show business that another bloke and I
went on a barnstorming tour of Tennes-
see in a Model-T Ford and we got so
involved that we just never went back to
school after the school holidays I left
home at 17.
“During the Depression it was pretty
rugged but the experience was valu-
able, although we were never unemploy-
ed for very long. When there was no
show business we still had to eat and I
remember working in a Chinese laundry.
But we did everything we worked on
show-boats and on carnivals, medicine


shows, circuses, and when these shows
folded we went into ‘repertoire’. These
were little dramatic shows that played
one week under canvas, doing six changes
in programmes. You would do about six
parts. If you were the guy who was kil-
led in the first act you might come back
as the juvenile in the second act and so
on.
“In the later Depression years I was in
the big time in radio and vaudeville
except that in a period like that, nothing
was really big-time. I toured the U.S.
in the ‘Marcus Show’ with my old buddy
Danny Kaye—we still keep in touch, and
I played the Keith Orpheum theatre cir-
cuit (later the RKO film theatres) but
it was hopeless. There was no big money
in it. Vaudeville died when I went in it,
but I just stayed on and on.
Tongue in Cheek
“Tn the 1930 s I was in some of the
biggest and best radio programmes in
America but that was at a time when
it didn’t mean very much because they
didn’t have many radios. I was in the
country history-making ‘Grand Old
Opry’ programmes which pioneered the
revival of interest in western music. 1 did
my hill-billy act with tongue in cheek
as a burlesque. If I had stayed in Ten-
nessee my star might have shone, but
I have never regretted anything I have
done, least of all coming to Australia
to live. When I go to America now I
come back quicker every time I can't
get back quick enough. There are things
about show business in the US that 1
don’t like. We're only mice out here by
comparison but we are developing in the
same directions unfortunately.”
Bob came to Australia in “The Marcus
Show” (named after the entrepreneur)
which opened in Sydney in July, 1937
In the Mitchell Library there is a fascina-
ting file, formerly in police records, in-
cluding complaints from the public about
“The Marcus Show", billed as the nudest
and rudest show ever seen in Australia".
With one exception (a cryptic note from
H. Bert, c/- Oxford Street Post Office,
which was probably phony) all the com-
plaints were made before the show open-
ed. The Methodist Church, WCTU and
Methodist Girls’ Comrades organised
deputations to the Chief Secretary who
sent licensing police to every perform-
ance. The police were the object of deri-
sion from the audiences—they were uni-
formed —but seem to have enjoyed the
show and their reports to the Minister
were kindily disposed. No complaints
were made about Bob Dyer.
After leaving “The Marcus Show” he
toured England and made his television
debut at the Alexandra Palace, London,
at the end of 1937, in the first hill-billy
show to be telecast there. I think he had
a fairly thin time in the UK. Bob re-
turned to Australia in 1939 and as the
self-styled “Last of the Hill-Billies” tour-
ed the Tivoli circuit—complete with gui-
tar. In 1940, after a lightning courtship,
he married the prettiest of the chorus
girls, Dolly Mack. Candid friends predic-
ted that the marriage would last a month.
As it happens the Dyers have a rapport
that is rare enough anywhere in the com-
munity but in show business the in-
tensity of their love verges on the super-
natural.
In 1940 he moved to Melbourne and
began his own radio programme on 3DB.
To save money on fares they both took
up cycling.
Bob Dyer served for three years in
the US Special Services Branch Entertain-
ment Section and with his own variety
company toured Australian and American
camps and performed in battle areas in
New Guinea and the Solomons. To cope
with the demand for new comedy mater-
ial Dolly learnt shorthand so that she
could take down jokes from short-wave
broadcasts of shows by Sid Caesar and
Jack Benny.
His famous and friendly rivalry with
the brilliant and witty Jack Davey began
at this time. It may have been con-
sciously modelled on the rivalry of Jack
Benny and Fred Allen in the US but it
was certainly spontaneous.
His radio shows, especially in the post-
war years, were marked by stunts for
which big money was paid to contestants
for example the Bondi lifesaver who
was pushed through Sydney streets in a
pram, wearing a bikini, the man who
stayed overnight in a haunted house; the
women who had their hair shaved off and
were fitted with wigs in return for house-
hold goods. Custard pies and squirts from
soda syphons were commonplace. By
1949 the Press reported him as paying the
Highest personal exertion tax in the nation
with a salary (in those austere C'hifleyan
days) of £13.000 p.a.
When television came to Australia in
i 956 Bob prepared himself lot it by
flying to the US for expert advice. He
reduced his weight by about three stone,
trimmed his moustache and substituted
executive style suits for the Hawaiian
shirts seen in radio publicity shots. Why
did he succeed in television while Jack
Davey failed? “He didn't have the time
for a start: he died before he could
develop his style. We met the same dif-
ficulties but I was better equipped than
Jack. Not with talent be sure of that,
and you can quote me on this but be-
cause I had a better psychological ap-
proach. I had seen it and done it over-
seas and had many years of stage experi-
ence which Jack never had. He had a
far greater talent in his particular field
than any one I have ever known —but he
was not psychologically adjusted to tele-
vision. He didn’t like the thought of it
He was so successful in radio that he
thought he could just go into it with the
same techniques. He had a take-it-or-
leave-it attitude.
“I knew how much more demanding
it was because of my theatrical work and
prepared myself for some shocks and
they hit me right between the eyes. It
was hard to take. But if he had lived
I am sure Jack would have adjusted.”
Bob Dyer, like the late Jack Davey,
is extremely hard working and expects
those with him to work hard as well.
Smiling and relaxed, he is the embodiment
of the man on top cf everything when
doing a show. Technicians call him
‘“Bob” which he insists on and he goes
into action by warming up his audience
in his mixed Australian-American accents
with one of the world's corniest jokes
“When you smile, show your teeth. No
dear, there's no need to take them out
...” He is easy to work with, although
professionally demanding, and both on
and off the set is free from malice and
professional or personal jealousy. In
short he manages to keep both his counsel
and his reputation when all about him are
losing theirs. He is certainly not free of
anxiety or tension, however. During a
show his hands tremble and he sweats
freely. Dolly is less tense but anxiety
makes her pitch her voice rather higher
than in normal conversation.
Behind the convincing display of con-
fidence and spontaneity that comes out
on TV lies a great deal of tense, nervous,
meticulous planning. All of his apparently
casual commercials and introductions are
carefully memorised and in the last
seconds before the show goes on the
air Bob and Dolly rotate behind the set
with eyes closed reciting the key words
for introducing key scenes and ads in
the show. And yet whatever tension they
may feel is not reflected in their social
life. Bob gave up smoking some years ago
and at parties drinks only highly diluted
and infrequent whiskies while heartlessly
urging fruit drinks on his guests. Dolly
neither smokes nor drinks at all. Their
only indulgence is an apparently insati-
able desire for ice cream about two
and a half gallons a week.
Not so Simple
is quite obviously not as simple
and uncomplicated as he sounds. He
reads very little (although he enjoyed
both “Lord of the Flies'’ and “Voss”
which I pressed upon him) and never
sees films, but listens to records and
watches TV. Even in 1961 he had
neither seen nor heard Peter Sellers or
Mort Sahl although he was persuaded to
watch Hancock. He likes Steptoe and
Son. For a professional comedian his
own private brand of humour is sadly
simple. But there is an unexpected part


few,
for people with strong ideas about coffee
(and its price)
Nescafe Espresso is a stronger, richer coffee. Specially
prepared for the one person in three who prefers more
strength, more full-bodied flavour than you find in regular
instant coffees. It is a strong, high roast instant coffee
for strong-minded people who appreciate only the best.
And now Nescafe Espresso is at a new popular price.

of him which keeps popping out though.
He is a highly skilled photographer and
cut and edited the 60-minute film on
Jack Davey which won an award of
which he is justly proud. He would like
to apply this skill in more challenging
ways and has longed for some time to
do a film biography on Ben Chifley and
other top politicians of the past.
At the top of a very exacting profession
and in his fifties, Dyer is a strange man
indeed with his genial good humour, his
capacity to accept people as they are,
his good business sense, his ability to
organise, his unrealised ambitions, his
misleading image of being an average
man of average suburban interests, his
preference for facts over surmise. Even
his Tennessee (where people no longer
understand his accent) background is
strange. A cousin is the notorious Martin
Dies, the Texan Congressman who head-
ed the Un-American Activities Commit-
tee in the 19305. And yet Bob himself is
an old-fashioned liberal in many ways.
He dislikes bloodsports (but not fishing),
boxing and capital punishment. He is a
racial egalitarian and told me some years
ago: “Back in Tennessee my elder bro-
ther, a Negro boy and I all grew up to-
gether. We walked to school every day
and walked back home together, but at
the cross-roads the Negro boy walked one
way to the all-Negro school while my
brother and I went to the all-white school.
Where was the point in separation during
school hours when we were like brothers
for the rest of the day? Our Negro friend
later got into trouble and died tragically.
I often wonder what would have hap-
pened if our colors had been reversed.
That is one of the reasons why I have
always hated racial or religious intoler-
ance”.
An Audience of One
Pussy-cat, pussy-cat , where are you going?
By CHARLES HIGHAM
Half pussy-cat and half spider-mon-
key, Eartha Kitt unravelled her-
self from the green chaise-longue
on the Sydney Chevron stage and glit-
tered through a dozen songs, some old,
some new, about minks, Cadillacs, mil-
lionaires and La Dolce Vita; the act, per-
fected almost a decade ago in Leonard
Silman’s “New Faces”, is nowadays cast
in a rigid mould she laughs acidly or
naughtily, writhes about the stage, and
for some of her numbers stares fixedly
at a member of the audience, inviting
him cynically to her dressing-room after
the show. The mask of diamond-hard
sophistication is now an immutable fix-
ture, the technique superbly polished,
and the delivery with its purrs, sudden
wild cries and unexpected swoops down
the scale, is overpoweringly professional.
Days later, in a pink-flowered muu-muu
with a pink hand-towel swathed round
her head in cotton-pickin’ style, Eartha
stood against the Sydney skyline in her
high-up suite talking about her private
and public personalities (the most locally
exploited one, mamma gambolling with
baby, wasn't there because the latter was
missing).
I asked her if it had taken long to
develop that famous stage presence of
hers: the public gold-digger, hard and
ambitious, out for the good life, seemed
to have little to do with the nervous,
insecure woman offstage. “But I don’t
act a gold-digger!” she said sharply, pac-
ing about the room busily rearranging
flowers, brushing imaginary dust off the
petals, and doing the whole actress bit
except reorganising the furniture. “I’m
just a sweet, innocent child-like thing!
With this quality of innocence! Yes,
that’s it, like a child asking for sweets!”
She apparently saw her “real” self in
this light, too, the stage and private
Eartha Kitt virtually the same person.
And she was self-created: she said that
when Leonard Silman, producer of “New
Faces,” had asked her to appear in his
show, he had only known her as a dram-
atic actress. So she had sat down and
prepared songs, writing some of the
lyrics herself, and working out the ar-
rangements from scratch all this, it
seemed, with no musical training at all.
Had she then done it all herself?
“No, there was Orson Welles, of course.
He gave me confidence. At night after
the show when I was appearing in ‘Mrs
Paterson’ with him in Paris, we would
simply paint scenery without saying a
word together. There was this won-
derful thing between us. And in the
morning we would walk to my hotel
along the Champs Elysees.
“And he was the first person I’d ever
known I could call a man and who
didn’t think I was stupid. He would al-
ways have me at the head of the table
he’d give parties for 20 guests which
he couldn’t pay for and he’d listen
to what I said. I remember one time I
said something and he cried, ‘My God,
My God, MY GOD! that was brilliant’.”
As she talked, Eartha Kitt kept moving
about, sometimes sitting and gazing in-
tently at me, bare feet tucked under her,
hand on open palm, elbow on knee,
more often staring out the window or
darting into the next room to grab a
cigarette from her mother-in-law, or go-
ing through a series of moues and sighs
off, as though all this fame was too much
for her. The charm, if perilously, was
always sustained, and then with a knock
on the door it snapped off. “Who is itT ’
she snarled. A woman's smiling face
peeped round the corner. “Just me. A
man wants to put a screen in your bed-
room, Miss Kitt,” the face said nervously.
“Shall I ask him to do it later, I’m inter-
rupting you?” “You are and he can,” said
Miss Kitt. The door closed softly.
That done with, she talked about her
friends, June Allyson, Judy Garland,
Marlon Brando, though she didn’t say
anything you couldn’t find in a publicity
brochure (“June is so intelligent, Marlon
is so honest, he can’t stand people who
fawn on him”). Of her films, she had
liked “Anna Lucasta” especially because
of the director, Arnold Laven, who “was
so understanding, he made me play me,
he discovered what I was like, what I
was.” That didn’t seem very illuminating,
so I asked her what she was. “Well, he
saw the warmth, saw how warm I really
am,” she purred loudly, without a trace
of self-admiration in her voice.
One wondered what her future plans
could be: how long she could keep up
what is now a rigidly repetitive, if still
brilliant, stage performance with which
most of her fans must now be very
familiar. Television? “No, it’s dangerous
to appear in a long series, though I dare
say my reputation could sustain it. And
1 haven’t any film plans. But I’d like to
do a play which is going to open the
new and first Hollywood theatre;
it’s being started by a manufacturer of
fountain pens named Lindy. Lindy’s
fountain pens. You know?”
I didn't, but it didn’t matter, she was
off on her own again. As she talked
about the play characteristically, she
had forgotten the author’s name how
it was a comedy, “Oops, the Natives are
Restless Tonight,” and mirrored the
world situation, one felt that the pres-
ence of even an audience of one was
superfluous. From the thin, dark face
small, wet, almost expressionless cats’
eyes looked out, entranced by where
she’d got.
A call came through. A soft woman’s
voice, discreet from long practice with
temperamental stars: “Will you be free
now, for another interview, Miss Kitt?”
Again the charm had gone, a blind had
come down. She scowled, then giggled
coldly. “OK, all right, all right.” As I
rose to go, she looked bored, frowning
at the floor, and sat down. The door
opened, Andrea swept into view. Eartha
Kitt didn’t need to sigh.

The Passing
of the Irish
In an orgy of self-criticism
By DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN
It is now well over a century since
any of the various groups living in
New York has been able to claim
so much as a bare majority of the popu-
lace; only the Jews today can claim even
a quarter. There have been times, how-
ever, when one group after another
established what might be termed a
working hegemony: first it was the
Dutch, then the English, then the Irish.
The first two were simply swamped by
newcomers (white Anglo-Saxons are
barely 5 per cent of the current popula-
tion), but the passing of the Irish era has
been a more complex matter, touching
on much that is central to the present
turmoil in New York.
The Irish era can be said to have
begun with the fall of Boss Tweed in
the 1870 s.
During the era that followed, the Irish
seemed to be everywhere, involved in
everything. With few exceptions the pre-
1870s Irish had represented the canaille.
With the dawning of the Gilded Age,
however, middle-class and upper-class
Irish began to appear; thus ranging across
the social spectrum, the Irish appeared
to dominate a good part of the city’s life
for half a century. They came to run
the police force and the underworld; they
were as evident on Wall Street as on the
Bowery; Irish contractors laid out the
subways and Irish laborers dug them. It
was a stimulating miscellany, reaching
its height in the Roaring 20s with A 1
Smith and Jimmy Walker. And then,
suddenly, came the crash. In June, 1932,
Smith was denied the Democratic re-
nomination. Two months later Mayor
Walker resigned in the face of mount-
ing scandal, and decided to leave the
country with his beloved English mistress,
Betty. A few days before his departure,
Franklin Roosevelt had been elected
President. The next man to be elected
Mayor of New York City would be
Fiorello H. La Guardia. Then a Jew
became world heavyweight champion; the
new name in baseball was DiMaggio; the
new crooner was Sinatra. And so it
went. The almost formal end came within
a decade: In 1943 Tammany Flail itself,
built while Walker was Mayor at the
cost of just under one million dollars,
was sold to Local 91 of the International
Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union. Tam-
many and the New York County Demo-
cratic Committee went their separate
ways. The oldest political organization
on earth was finished. So was the Irish
era.
The basis of Irish hegemony in the
city was established by the famine emi-
gration of 1846-1850. By 1890, when 80
per cent of the population of New York
City was of foreign parentage, a third
of these (409,924 persons out of
1,215,463) were Irish, making more than
a quarter of the total population. With
older stock included, over one-third of
the population of New York and Brook-
lyn at the outset of the Gay 90s was
Irish-American.
By now the New York City Irish were
not only voting for the Democratic party
but thoroughly controlled its organisation.
“The Irish role in politics,” it has been
said, “was creative, not imitative”
to which it may be added that it was also
unprecedented in that it led to a persist-
ing pattern of rule by men of the people.
Almost to this day, the men who have
run New York have talked out of the
side of the mouth. There is nothing sur-
prising in the fact that this unnatural
situation should always have appalled
those with-a-stake-in-the-country.
But the most important accomplish-
ment of the Irish in America is not poli-
tical it is religious. The Irish may have
been creative about political organization,
but they were also indifferent to political
ideas, and therefore very little came of
their hegemony in New York except a
continuing series of victories at the polls.
Much, however, has come of their de-
votion to their Church, which they have
built from a despised sect of the 18th
century to the largest religious organiza-
tion in the nation, numbering some
43,851,500 members in 1963. In secular
terms, this achievement has cost them
dearly. A good part of the surplus that
might have gone into family property has
gone instead into building the Church —-
which has almost certainly inhibited the
development of the solid middle-class
dynasties that produce so many of the
important people in America. The
celibacy of the Catholic clergy has also
deprived the Irish of the class of
ministers’ sons which has contributed
notably to the prosperity and distinction
of the Protestant world. And to make
matters worse, these disadvantages have
been reinforced by a pervasive prejudice
against Catholics on the part of Protes-
tants that has still not entirely disappear-
ed.
The Catholic Church does not measure
its success by the standards of secular
society. Many of its finest men and
women disappear from the great world
altogether. This is well understood and
accepted by Catholics. What troubles a
growing number of persons within the
Church is the performance of the great
bulk of Catholics who remain very much
a part of the secular society around them.
For a Church notably committed to the
processes of intellect, the weakness of
Catholic scholars and writers is particu-
larly galling. It is, for example, notorious
that Catholics in America have produced
hatdly a handful of important scientists.
Yet neither have they produced a great
poet, a great painter, a great diplomatist.
None of the arts, none of the achieve-
ments that most characterise the older
Catholic societies, seem to prosper here.
“Is the honorable adjective ‘Roman
Catholic’ truly merited by America's
middle-class-Jansenist Catholicism, puri-
tanised, Calvinised, and dehydrated?”
asked the Protestant Peter Viereck.
The Wild Ones
lrish,” wrote Macaulay, “. . . were
distinguished by qualities which
tend to make men interesting rather than
prosperous. They were an ardent and
impetuous race, easily moved to tears or
laughter, to fury or to love.” The Irish-
American character as it finally deve-
loped was not very different from the one
Macaulay described, save in two respects:
it was urban and it was egalitarian.
Where the Irish had been wild, they now
became tough. Where they had been re-
bellious, it now became more a matter
of being defiantly democratic. In the
words of Thomas Beer, “an infinitely

pugnacious, utterly common and merry
animal.”
Let it be said that the Irish gave style
to life in the slums:
Boys and girls together, me
and Mamie O’Rorke,
Tripped the light fantastic on
the sidewalks of New York.
They became the Playboys of this new
Western World. “None Can Love Like
an Irishman” was a favorite song of
Lincoln’s day. By the turn of the cen-
tury it had become equally clear that
none could run like them, nor fight like
them, nor drink as much, nor sing as
well.
Much was forgiven them. Their fail-
ures, as they themselves said of their
principal one, were “a good man’s weak-
ness.” A certain compassion pervaded
even their wrongdoing. Jimmy Walker
was nothing so much as P. T. Barnum
in a speakeasy: predatory, not evil. At
their best such Irish had a genius for
getting through to people: no one in the
history of New York has ever been able
to explain state government to the voters
in the way A 1 Smith did. Nor have they
ever quite forgotten the compliment he
paid their intelligence.
By degrees the Irish style of the gas-
light era became less and less Irish, more
and more the style of the American city.
When the comic strips began, the prin-
cipal urban characters Maggie and
Jiggs, Moon Mullins, Dick Tracy
were Irish. When the movies undertook
to fashion a composite picture of the
American people, the New York Irish-
man was projected to the very centre of
the national image.
For whatever reason, perhaps because
of the influence of New York Jews in
the film industry, when Hollywood
wanted to synthesize the Christian re-
ligion, they found it easiest to do in the
person of an Irish priest: Pat O'Brien as
Father Duffy in the trenches. When the
tough American up from the streets had
to be portrayed, the image drawn was
invariably that of an Irishman. James
Cagney (a New Yorker) was the quin-
tessential figure: fists cocked, chin out,
back straight, bouncing along on his
heels. But also doomed: at the end of
the movie he was usually dead. The con-
trast with Chaplin tells worlds.
And by the time the New York jour-
nalist, John O'Sullivan, coined the phrase
“Manifest Destiny” as a compact apolo-
getic for American expansionism, the
Irish had also become seasoned national-
ists. Their exploits, or their accounts
thereof, in the Mexican and Civil Wars
established the American institution of
the “Fighting Irish.”
Today, on the surface, the “Irish” in
Irish-American is fast fading. A very
considerable body of Irish traits and
speech habits has become so thoroughly
absorbed in New York culture as no
longer to be regarded as Irish. And even
the most visible Irish contribution to
the New York scene, the Irish saloon,
is vanishing, decimated by prohibition
and now unable to compete with the
attractions of television and the fact
that Italians can cook.
Unquestionably, however, an Irish
identity persists. It would seem that it
now marks someone as plain, in con-
trast to fancy, American. In an urbane
culture, Irishness has come to represent
some of the qualities the honest yeoman
stood for in an earlier age, notably in
the undertone of toughness and practi-
cality. “Be more Irish than Harvard,”
Robert Frost told the young President
in 1961. But the problem with perpetu-
ating this Irish type is that it is essenti-
ally proletarian and does not jibe with
middle-class reality. Like Southern hos-
pitality, the Irish temperament has be-
come a tradition valid enough, per-
haps, but requiring constant reinforce-
ment.
Guests from Eire
fJ'HREE additional factors are working
toward a weakening of Irish identity
in America: the decline of immigration,
the fading of Irish nationalism, and the
relative absence of Irish cultural influ-
ence from abroad on the majority of
American Irish.
A trickle of Irishmen continues to
arrive in New York, but it is barely
sufficient to keep the County Associa-
tions alive and to provide talent for and
interest in the sporting events that are
centred at Gaelic Park in the Bronx.
And in truth, most of the recent immi-
grants are rather a disappointment to the
American Irish, just as Ireland itself is
to many Americans who go back. Few
sights are more revealing than that of
a second- or third-generation Irish-Ameri-
can tourist sitting down to his first meal,
boiled in one iron pot over the open
peat fire, in his grandparents’ cottage.
Embarrassment hangs just as heavy over
the Fifth Avenue reviewing stand of the
St Patrick's Day parade. The sleek, por-
cine judges and contractors, all uneasy
bravado, simply don’t know what to
make of the smallish, dour Irish officials
and emissaries gathered for the occasion.
Neither do the guests from Eire seem
to know quite what to make of the
“O’Donnell Abu,” Fighting 69th, “Top
o’ the Marnin” goings-on. In Dublin,
March 17th is a holy day, and until re-
cently the bars were closed.
Indications are that the Irish are now
about the most evenly distributed group
in New York in terms of economic and
social position. They are perhaps a bit
heavy on the extremes: rather more than
their share of the men on the Bowery
and on Wall Street, but generally about
the right proportions. In this respect they
are unique among the major ethnic
groups in New York.
Their distribution within class strata
is not nearly so even. Sean O’Faolain
has reminded us that the ancient Irish
had a powerful distaste for commerce;
throughout history the Irish were by
preference lawyers and soldiers and
priests, and the pattern rather persists
in the New World. The Irish are well
represented in Wall Street law firms.
But they have shown relatively little
talent as merchants, and most of those
who have, have been quite overwhelmed
by Jewish competition.
The principal Irish businesses in the
city still tend to be family affairs, foun-
ded by working men and involving the
organisation of manual labor in forms
that may begin small and grow larger.
The Irish have also done well in con-
tracting, real estate, and banking, where
there is stress on personal qualities and
the accommodation of conflicting in-
terests, and not a little involvement in
politics. So, too, the Irish talent for
political bureaucracy seems to have car-
ried over into the world of business
organisation. The Irish have been content
to get in the long lines of the giant cor-
porations and for some time have been
popping up in the front ranks as their
turn came. In the long run, their pat-
ience may prove as important a com-
mercial asset as Jewish daring or Yankee
rigor.
For the moment, however, the rele-
vant question is not how well the Irish
have succeeded, but why they have not
succeeded more. The English and Dutch
who preceded them in New York are
now almost entirely middle-and upper-
class. The Germans who accompanied
them are predominantly middle-class.
The Jews who followed them are already
predominantly middle-class and may
soon be exclusively so. But if the major-
ity of the Irish have climbed out of the
working class, it has been only to settle
on the next highest rung.
Instead of profiting by their success
in the all-but-despised roles of ward
heeler and policeman, the Irish seem to
have been trapped by it. As with the
elder Tyrone in O'Neill’s Long Day's
Journey Into Night, they seem almost
to have ruined their talent by playing
one role over and over until they could
do little else.
For Tyrone, as for his sons, so also
for the race: drink has been their curse.
It is the principal fact of Irishness that
they have not been able to shake. A
good deal of competent enquiry has
still not produced much understanding of
the Irish tendency to alcohol addiction.
But whatever the explanation, the fact
itself is indisputable, and in ways it is
worse now than in the past: a stevedore

It is evident enough that Irish drunk-
enness has given the Jews (whose alco-
holism rates are as phenomenally low as
those of the Irish are high) an important
margin in business and the professions
it may even have tended to keep the
Irish out of some of the professions.
Probably, also, alcoholism partially ac-
counts for the disappearance of the
Irish from organised crime. Gambling
and related activities are among the
largest business activities in New York
and certainly among the most profitable.
With their political power, even if de-
clining, the Irish ought to have a share
of control in them, but others have com-
pletely taken over. Bookmaking, policy,
and drugs are complex, serious, exacting
trades. They are not jobs for heavy
drinkers.
Turning lower-middle-class is a painful
process for a group like the Irish who,
as stevedores and truck drivers, made
such a grand thing of Saturday night.
Most prize fighters and a good many
saloon fighters die in the gutter but
they have moments of glory unknown
to accountants. Most Irish laborers died
penniless, but they had been rich one
night a week much of their lives, where-
as their white-collar children never know
a moment of financial peace much less
affluence. A good deal of color goes
out of life when a group begins to rise.
A good deal of resentment enters.
The sense of displacement is nowhere
more acute than in politics. The crucial
turning point was the rejection of A 1
Smith, first by his country and then by
the Democrats themselves. The New
York Irish gave their hearts to Smith.

bitter anti-Catholicism and the
crushing defeat of the 1928 campaign
came as a blow. The New York Irish
had been running their city for a long
time, or so it seemed. They did not
think of themselves as immigrants and
interlopers with an alien religion; it was
a shock to find that so much of the
country did.
A 1 Smith openly endorsed the Repub-
lican candidate for the Presidency in
1936. In a major address to an enthu-
siastic New York City audience he ac-
cused Roosevelt of preparing the way for
a Communist-controlled America. The
feeling of displacement is painfully
evident.
The decade and a half that followed
was not an easy one for the Catholic
Irish. Disdained on the Left as reaction-
aries because of their violent opposition
to the Soviet Union, they were not really
welcomed by the Protestant establish-
ment, whose interests they sought to
preserve.
The crisis came in the years immedi-
ately after the Second World War when
evidence began to accumulate about the
true nature of the Communist con-
spiracy. Alger Hiss and Owen Latti-
more and the Rosenbergs seemed proof
enough for anybody but not for a
good number of persons in the Protest-
ant-Jewish intellectual elite. This is the
context in which the New York Irish
turned overwhelmingly to the support
of Senator McCarthy. But a clue to the

nature of McCarthy’s influence on the
New York Irish is that from start to
finish he got his largest response from
them not when he attacked Communism
but when he attacked the institutions of
the white Anglo-Saxon Protestant estab-
lishment. It was Harvard University and
the State Department and the United
States Army that seemed to be sub-
verting the country. The faculty of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s college was
riddled with Reds. Dean Gooderham
Acheson would not turn his back on
spies in the Foreign Service. George
Catlett Marshall was a front man for
traitors.
McCarthy finally let the Irish down.
He ended up a stumblebum lurching
about the corridors of the Senate where
it had been decided that he was no
gentleman. This left the Irish to defend
a reputation that had become, in prac-
tical terms, indefensible. Yet the Irish
achieved a strong temporary advantage
from the McCarthy period that may
or may not prove of permanent value.
In the era of security clearances, to be
an Irish Catholic became prima facie
evidence of loyalty. Harvard men were
to be checked; Fordham men would do
the checking. There was also a disad-
vantage in this, however, for it put the
Irish back on the force, encouraging
their tendency to be regular rather than
creative.
In 1960, when, for the second time,
an Irish Catholic ran for President, it
turned out that for many the estrange-
ment from the Democratic Party had
gone too deep to be overcome by more
primitive appeals. Alfred E. Smith, Jr.,
announced he was voting for Nixon.
In fashionable Greenwich, Connecticut,
the grandson of John H. McCooey of
Brooklyn tur. ed up ringing doorbells
for the straight Republican ticket. Ken-
nedy probably got little more than a
bare majority of the Irish vote in New
York City. And it appears it was the
Jewish students in the Fordham School
of Pharmacy who saved that ancient
Jesuit institution from going on record
as opposed to the election of the first
Catholic President of the United States.
“State Aid”?
T>ut the future of the Irish in New
York p -litics is not a strictly political
question. Much will depend on events
within the Catholic Church, which is
now entering a new phase both for the
clerics and the laity.
Encouraged by the growing propor-
tion of educated Catholics and much
stimulated by the renaissance of Catholic
thought in Europe, American Catholic
intellectual life is going through, in the
words of one nun, “an orgy of self-
criticism.” The most widely discussed
statement of the issue appeared in 1955
in the Fordham quarterly Thought. It
was written by Monsignor John Tracy
Ellis. Msgr. Ellis began with Denis
Brogan’s statement that “in no Western
society is the intellectual prestige of
Catholicism lower than in the country
where, in such respects as wealth,
numbers, and strength of organisation, it
is so powerful.” “No well-informed
Catholic,” said Monsignor Ellis, “will
attempt to challenge that statement.”
There are three elements to this crisis.
First, the Catholics have a large and
rapidly growing population. Second, it
is the teaching of the Church and the
wish of most of the laity that Catholic
children should be educated in Catholic
schools. Third, if this education is to
meet their rising intellectual and social
requirements, the already crushing cost
will grow much greater; this leads to an
increasingly adamant demand that in
one way or another an end be put to
the “double taxation” of Catholics in the
field of education.
The present prospects for public
assistance to parochial schools are at
best doubtful. The basic problem is that
Catholics have failed to persuade any
significant number of non - Catholic
opinion leaders of the justice of their
case (although this may be changing,
as evidenced by Walter Lippmann’s
recent pronouncement). In New York,
Catholic spokesmen have not yet been
able to couch the issue in terms that
have appeal, even perhaps meaning, for
many Jewish or Protestant spokesmen;
nor have they succeeded in providing
Catholics in public and party office with
any very coherent understanding of the
problem. This is itself a measure of
Catholic isolation from the liberal
secular tradition of the city that is
epitomized by the New York “Times”.
If an accommodation is reached on
the school issue, there is likely to be
some diminution of Catholic defensive-
ness of the kind that led Heywood
Broun to call the New York Irish “the

cry babies of the Western world.” This
defensiveness can be particularly de-
structive on the issue of Communist sub-
version and American loyalty. New
York Catholics have been prone to
think they have learned something
when the leader of Tammany Hall in-
forms a communion breakfast of the
Sanitation Department Holy Name
Society that “there is no Mother’s Day
behind the Iron Curtain.” When a num-
ber of the leading universities of the
nation announced their opposition to the
loyalty oath provisions of the National
Defence Education Act 1958, Catholic
newspapers all over the country, as one
disgusted Catholic scientist put it,
“proudly displayed front-page stories in
which they told how Catholic students
in Catholic colleges virtually demanded
loyalty oaths. . . This is at best a
curious posture for members of a
Church whose principal effort in
American society has been to limit the
role of the State in education.
The announcement in 1961 by the
head of the John Birch Society that half
his membership was Catholic —whether
or not true —caused a stir in Catholic
circles, as did the rise of the radical
Right in genera 1 in the post-Eisenhower
period. Elements within the Church
appeared to realise how uncritical and
remote from reality large sections of lay
opinion had become. There followed a
series of lucid and eloquent statements
denouncing extremist organisations and
expounding the bases of effective anti-
Communism. But whether the minds of
those concerned had been conditioned
beyond the reach of appeals to reason
remained to be seen.
The excesses of Catholic militancy are
producing a reaction among the laity as
well. The isolation of the Catholic com-
munity is rapidly breaking down as the
great issues of the 1930 s and 1940 s
recede. The passing of the Franco
regime in Spain will remove a time-
honored source of misunderstanding,
bitterness, and bona-fide hostility. The
expulsion of Communism from the
power centres of American life has been
acknowledged in most Catholic circles,
while the appearance of Communism in
Latin America must give Catholics pause
in their assumptions about the process
of Marxist subversion: no Protestant
country has yet gone Communist.
Clearly, the era of Irish hegemony in
the city is past, but so also is their isola-
tion. A new era is upon them, one
which may be said to have begun on the
day the President of the United States
and the Prime Minister of Great Britain
were photographed at the rail of the
Presidential yacht, standing above a large
life preserver on which W'as emblazoned

OVERSEAS
Vivere Pericoloso!
Soekarno likes to quote II Duce
By ARNOLD BEICHMAN
(who is now touring Indonesia )
By now 1 think it should be conceded
that as statesman-politician the life-
time President of Indonesia is with-
out peer in South-East Asia. Or, as the
ballad went in “Damn Yankees,” “What
Lola wants, Lola gets.”
Mr Soekarno’s achievements in little
more than a decade are quite remark-
able. He has magnified Indonesia’s in-
fluence in the Afro-Asian world to such
an extent that he may today claim the
support of a strange alliance—President
Kennedy, Nikita Khrushchev and Chair-
man Mao. He has turned abstract statis-
tics into diplomatic power—one hundred
million impoverished people living in
what potentially could be the third rich-
est country in the world, but which today
is bankrupt; a military force which, on
the parade ground, is the strongest in the
area and which enjoys a steady flow of
guns on credit from Russia, and
ploughshares—on credit —from America.
Most remarkable of all is that while
Japan had to go to war to drive Britain
out of Singapore, Mr Soekarno may win
a similar but more permanent victory
without a single shot being fired in anger.
At a time when his sole rival for Asian
influence, Pandit Nehru, faces the night-
marish possibility of a two-front war —•
China and Pakistan—Mr Soekarno rules
his archipelago empire secure in the
knowledge that no neighbor threatens
him. If China ever should, the omni-
present US Seventh Fleet will be on call
to save him. Actually, China is today a
good friend of Mr Soekarno. The USSR
and China may struggle for ideological
primacy, but Mr Soekarno loves them
both. Though the US is embroiled in
Laos, Vietnam, Korea and Taiwan, Mr
Soekarno is breaching the cordon sani-
taire around Red China without visible
irritation in Washington.
Domestically, Mr Soekarno is even
more secure. Under his system of “guided
democracy,” opposition leaders are in
gaol or under house arrest without
charges against them. The only other
national figure, Mohammed Hatta, is ill
and in hospital. The handful of intel-
lectuals who once comprised the Social-
ist opposition are isolated and cautious.
Even the Indonesian Communist Party,
PKI, numerically the largest in the free
world, is, perhaps for the moment, a
tame Soekarno captive. However, the
PKI cadres are not too despairing. “Bung
Karno” (Brother Karno, a national term
of endearment) has defined “the phobia
of anti-Communism” as a social crime;
the PKI chairman, D. N. Aidit, sits in
high Government councils; it controls the
biggest national labor federation, it do-
minates the National Front, owns news-
papers and magazines and influences
those it does not own, and has a virtual
majority of the directors who run the
single Press agency. A favorite Soekarno
slogan to be realised on some future date
is “NA-SA-KOM,” which stands for
nationalism, religion and Communism.
Perhaps Mr Soekarno’s most spectacu-
lar triumph thus far has been the ease
with which he huffed and puffed and blew
the house down the Federation of
Malaysia. And should greater Malaysia
by some miracle come into existence, its
life may be of short duration. Mr
Soekarno has another banana peel for
all to see, Maphilindo—an acrostic for
Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia. This
idea has won American support as
something far more viable than the
Malaysia Federation.
Although it once regarded Malaysia
favourably, if only in a faute cle mieux
spirit, Washington now looks upon the
scheme as expendable and not worth all
the trouble which the Indonesian leader
threatens to engineer should the Federa-
tion come to pass.
The certain effect of Washington’s lack
of support for the proposed Federation
will be the more rapid withdrawal of
British interest in the Far East and the
weakening of SEATO influence in South-
East Asia, particularly in the Philippines
with its American bases. None of this
would be displeasing to Mr Soekarno. In
1945, he wrote down a fantastic dream —-
an Indo-Malaysia stretching from the
borders of Thailand to New Guinea, the
ancient Modjapahit Empire. That dream
is on the way to realisation by a man who
but fifteen years ago was languishing in
a Dutch prison on the island of Bangka.
Bung Karno likes to read the lives of
other greai men. Recently he ran across
a phrase used by Mussolini “vivere
pericoloso” (the adverbial ending has dis-
appeared). He used the phrase in a
speech, with full credit to II Duce, and
“live dangerously” is now a favorite
utterance among his admirers. But noth-
ing really endangers his foreign and
domestic policies. Everything seems to be
going his way. America, Germany, Yugo-
slavia, the USSR, China everybody
wants to help. And if 40 per cent of
Indonesia’s export earnings of $6OO mil-
lion last year went to service the external
debt —a sure sign of disaster for ordinary
mortals—Mr Soekarno need not worry.
He takes the pledge, and dollars, roubles,
D-marks, yen and 40,000 tons of rice
from China start flowing uphill. Every-
body seeks his friendship. Australia, 120
miles away, above all. Indeed, who would
be surprised if one day Portugal were to
surrender its half of Timor, another piece
of Soekarno irredentism?
Indonesia is still an overwhelmingly
agricultural country which cannot feed
itself because of its high population
growth, low productivity and a mass
army of brown rats who each year nibble
away at least a quarter of the rice-plant
buds. Indonesia’s war-making potential
is nil. Inland transport and communica-
tions suffer from lack of maintenance
and are now at the crisis stage. Indone-
sian industry has an extraordinarily low

rupiah is worth less than one-third of its

Despite these economic frailties, Indo-
nesia is held dear by Washington geopoli-
ticians as their own Great Barrier Reef
against the Chinese Communist tide.

gaged in organising an Afro-Asian labor

Soviet Union, as a co-sponsor; that he
has organised (with Peking subventions)
his own “Olympic” games, called Ganefo,
or “Games of the New Emerging

that there is speculation about a Sino-
Indonesian “defence” treaty—all this
only intensifies competition for Mr
Soekarno’s favor.

The Paul Robeson Mystery
Why he wasn’t in the March on Washington
By OBADIAH WATKINS
Almost simultaneously with the
great Negro march on Washing-
ton, the mystery of the 65-year-old
American Negro singer Paul Robeson
was unfolding several thousand miles
away in London.
The mystery first emerged last May,
when the reputable French daily
“Figaro” reported that Robeson, who
had lived in the Soviet Union for over
a decade, had become disillusioned with
Communism and with Russia and felt
himself to have been the victim of a
great imposture. 'Figaro” quoted him as
saying: “Long persuaded that minorities
in the Soviet Union lived in complete
freedom and without the least restriction,
I discovered from day to day that this
wasn’t the case at all. They had to
adopt Soviet customs. They were told
that their culture was inferior to the new
culture coming from the Soviet state.
The only great writers were Soviet.
Western art was decadent, Western music
scandalous. 1 am disillusioned because
I found a different form of oppression
which is all the more dangerous because
it operates in the name of a bogus libera-
tion.”
Robeson had left the Soviet Union and
was under care in a nursing home in
south-west London on and off for the
last two years. All attempts to confirm
the “Figaro” story or to reach him were
carefully frustrated by his self-styled
spokesman, an official of the British
Musicians’ Union who is well known
for his pro-Soviet views. Questions were
evaded and deflected, initial denials were
modified, contradicted and then denied
again. vVhy was Robeson being held
incommunicado?
On August 25, perhaps as a result of
a London “Sunday Telegraph” corres-
pondent discovering where Robeson was
kept, he was spirited away to East
Germany. Mrs Robeson told the “Daily
Telegraph” correspondent, who flew on
the same plane, that when it was decided
that Robeson should leave London, “we
wanted to do it quietly. So I went to
the Polish Ambassador who said that
he would help. There has been a lot
of cloak and dagger about all this.”
The rest of the correspondent’s
account is interesting: “During the flight,
when I first tried to approach Mr Robe-
son to ask if he could clear up the
question of his political views, his wife
called members of the crew. She said to
me: ’I can disorganise the plane, if
necessary. No one can go near him.’
“Mrs Robeson is a formidable ‘pro-
tector’. She claimed: ‘1 know judo. I
learned it to keep people away from him
and I will happily kick them in the groin
or break their glasses.’ . . .
“In flight I introduced myselt to Mr
Robeson, who smiled charmingly and
seemed about to talk to me. Angrily,
Mrs Robeson, who was sitting beside
him, rose and asked me to return to my
seat. Mr Robeson sat silent as his wife
stood up and another woman took her
seat.”
The key to the mystery is probably
contained in a rather casual statement
made by a good friend of Robeson’s, the
talented West Indian actor Edric Con-
nor, who said on August 27: “Paul is
a tired man. This is a man who has
made history. Getting the Stalin Peace
Prize meant an awful lot to him. Then
Khrushchev came into power and you
know what happened not only to things
and people connected with Stalin but to
Stalin himself. Paul has never been the
same man since.”
Robeson had hitched his wagon to a
red star, and when it came plummeting
down through Khrushchev’s revelations
of Stalin’s hideous crimes, his world was
shattered. If everything was a terrible
lie then, what was the truth now?

FORUM
The Kangaroo Pest
A solution
By DAVID STENHOUSE
(Vice-President, Wild Life Preservation Society of Queensland)
THERE have been hard words said about kangaroos, especially in
recent months. One group, associated with the grazing and pastoral
industry, wants an intensive and large-scale campaign against them, to
reduce the damage they cause to pastures, fences, etc. An opposing
group, backed by the outspoken advocacy of the Duke of Edinburgh,
is strong in support of the kangaroos. Violent statements have been made
on both sides. But what are the realities of the situation? Are the two
groups in irrevocable opposition? Most important, how does the “Kan-
garoo Question ’ affect us—the general public—and is there any possible
solution to it?
A solution to the problem can be
found. More particularly, a better solu-
tion can be found, and found more
quickly, if it is recognised that the ap-
parent opposition between graziers and
conservationists is quite unnecessary. The
interests of the two groups are not ulti-
mately so very different, and it would be
better for both and for the rest of
us if they could co-operate.
One thing is certain. The “Kangaroo
Question” does affect us, all of us, every-
one in Australia and many people else-
where who have never even heard of
kangaroos. Nobody disputes that ’roos
do have at least some effect, sometimes
a very considerable effect, on meat and
wool production and these commodi-
ties give us a good part of our liveli-
hood, directly or indirectly. Our ex-
ports, too, provide these necessities of
life for a small but significant propor-
tion of the world’s human population;
and with this population exploding up-
wards at the rate of several million per
month every fraction of production is
soon going to be vital. Anything which
can in any way affect production is
therefore of fundamental importance to
everyone. The effect of kangarqos on
production is important to us in Aus-
tralia not in a vague and Ibng-term way,
but in a way as sh£rp as next year's
income tax: it may be necessary to use
more of ou.'r taxes to investigate kan-
garoos-. . . .
is no doubt that unless some-
thing is done, unless a sound policy is
formulated and resolutely carried out,
the situation will get worse, probably
rapidly. Nature takes a long time to
reach her climaxes, but they build up in
rapid crescendo when they do come
witness one of our past plagues, the
rabbit. Details of policy must wait upon
increased detailed knowledge of kan-
garoo economy; a programme to obtain
this knowledge is an urgent national
necessity; but the broad outlines of the
position, especially as to the conflict be-
tween conservationists and exterminators,
are already apparent. The key to the
situation lies in a proper understanding
of the biological issues involved.
Kangaroos have become a problem
because we have made them one. They
have increased because we have helped
them to increase. In altering the country
to make it more suitable for domestic
animals, we have also made it more
suitable for kangaroos. More food for
sheep means more food for kangaroos.
The predators of kangaroos dingoes,
hawks, etc. prey also on sheep, and
are therefore under continual attack:
again we are helping the kangaroos. In-
creased water-supplies help them too.
Tt follows from this that we can make
A our control-measures as tough as we
like —there will be no danger of exter-
minating kangaroos. We could not totally
eliminate them even if we wanted to- The
controversy between graziers and con-
servationists cannot, therefore, be a fun-
damental one. It all boils down to mat-
ters of detail. Not that the details are
unimportant but at least the main
issue is fairly clear: the kangaroo will
not become extinct in Australia as long
as there are human beings trying to raise
sheep and cattle.
Ways will have to be found for in-
corporating permanent kangaroo-controls
into the standard management practices
of the grazing country. It must be recog-
nized that total elimination, except for
short periods in limited areas, is not
possible. A price must be paid to the
environment for the use we make of it,
and the presence of some kangaroos is
part of that price. One risk we dare not
run is the risk involved in widespread
and haphazard poisoning campaigns. A
hunter’s rule is never to shoot unless he
knows exactly where the bullet is going
to end up with large-scale poisoning,
nobody knows where the poison is going
to end up. A lot of it could end up,
eventually, in us! Poison will have to be
used, perhaps, but its effects must be
continually watched. The effects of all
possible control measures will have to be
sorted out from each other and from
naturally-occurring changes. This is
where the co-ordinated administration of
control policies is important.
One type of control which has been
proved under some conditions is simply
to keep the pastures in good shape.
Kangaroos compete most effectively with
sheep under poor conditions (as do rab-
bits), so if conditions are kept good,
and overstocking avoided, the sheep
should be at an advantage. Once a piece
of land has deteriorated, of course, it
is necessary to get rid of the ’roos by
shooting or poisoning or other means

before productivity can be restored
but the main point is, that expensive
direct control measures should not need
to become a permanent feature of the
grazing economy. Indirect biological con-
trols can be permanently effective as
well as costing a fraction of massive
direct control, and from all points of
view are preferable in the long run.
The only apparent snag is that they take
a year or two to become established
some people feel it is much more useful
just to go out and blaze away with a
gun, despite the fact that experience has
proved the very limited usefulness of
shooting. Huge numbers of ’roos have
been shot, yet the problem has increased.
The cost of having kangaroos on the
land can be reduced if their hides and
carcasses are sold. This would be most
important in areas which would always,
inevitably, carry a lot of ’roos, i.e., mar-
ginal land. (A thought here is that from
the economic viewpoint quality counts:
high standards of production, enforced
if necessary by governmental or other
supervision, would be essential if exports
were contemplated.) But nobody would
suggest raising kangaroos instead of
sheep. . . .
And so we come to the conservation-
ists’ worry. What about all the non-harm-
ful animals, the rarer wallabies, the
animals which will be hard hit by kan-
garoo controls? What about preserving
some areas of our country in their nat-
ural state?
One widely-respected grazier points
out (in a private letter) that a majority
in the grazing industry would be in
favor of the establishment of wildlife
sanctuaries and refuges, provided that
such sanctuaries were established in un-
allocated land, and provided also that
precautions were taken to prevent the
spread of harmful animals from sanc-
tuaries into the surrounding stocked
areas.
LETTERS TO THE
EDITOR
CHIROPRACTORS
Sir,
Mr G. F. Kinney (24/8/63) talks of
the “kiss of death” simply because a
doctor was chairman of the Victorian
ALP committee on chiropractors. He says
the committee was “blatant” in its actions,
that it sifted evidence for the purpose of
damning bona-fide chiropractors, and that
its activities were a “farce”. His letter
also includes a completely inaccurate
summary of what took place at the 1960
ALP conference. This method of argu-
ing a case reflects most sadly on one
who claims to be scientifically trained.
The ALP committee on chiropractors,
despite Mr Kinney’s outpourings, studied
the matter with an open mind and came
to the decision that chiropractic was not
scientifically based, and in conflict with
what is known about the human body,
its ailments and their treatment.
Mr Kinney admitted that chiropractors
believe that spinal manipulation should be
used in the treatment of the common
cold, varicose veins, eczema, stammer-
ing, etc.
He said he has hundreds of case
histories from chiropractors who have
handled these cases. I accept his offer
to examine them, provided he does not
object to my bringing along scientifically
trained observers.

NUCLEAR DISARMERS
Sir,
Initially your reports on our organisa-
tion, the Sydney Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament, were consistent enough.
We were formed, you asserted (June 23,
last year), from a meeting of “semi-
bohemians”, “ALP members”, “lapsed
Trotskyites”, “respectables”, and a
Quaker. Naturally enough, this unlovely
crew faced an unlovely prospect: “Al-
though the Sydney CND has not as yet
been swallowed up by the Communist
Party’s NSW Peace Council, it seems only
a question of time.”
This prophecy was duly confirmed —
that is, in the pages of The Bulletin.
Reality has still to catch up with that
broad imaginative sweep. According to
the July 6 issue this year, CND “meetings
were always swamped by the superior
numbers of the Australian Peace Coun-
cil” (a Communist organisation).
Now, CND aims have remained un-

changed since its inception, and we
adhere rigidly to those aims; moreover,
a majority of the present committee at-
tended the original meeting. The swamp-
ing of our meetings by any group what-
soever would have gladdened our
hearts immensely, but has unfortunately
never happened. But these things we put
to one side they are merely facts,
and it is the consistency of your stories
we are discussing, not their truth.
So far then, so good; but now you
spoil it all with your latest effort (August
10). “The Peace Committee,” the faith-
ful Bulletin reader learns to his aston-
ishment, “has tended in the past to look
on the CND with amused tolerance.”
But what about all that swamping of
meetings only a month before, all that
swallowing and manipulating? Puzzled,
he reads on to find that the poor old
CND, though surely swamped, swallowed
and manipulated well and truly by now,
has just “made a direct challenge for
leadership of the whole ‘Peace’ move-
ment,” so alarming that “the Communist
Party has retaliated with counter-infiltra-
tion tactics”!
Nobody has really been swallowing,
swallowed, infiltrated or manipulated at
all; like so many other sensational events,
these have occurred only in Bulletin
“inside stories”.
Alison E. Mclntyre
(for the Committee,
Sydney CND)
Killara (NSW).
Miss Mclntyre deals with three
Bulletin articles, the first published in
June, 1962, the second and third in July
and August of this year. As I am not the
author of the first article I cannot com-
ment on it except to say that attitudes,
events and characters are apt to change
vastly in a year. As for my “Spies for
Peace” and “War on the Peace Front”
I find no contradiction in them, but
rather a straightforward reportage of
events unfolding, developing and chang-
ing within a short space of time.
It is a fact of life that the Communist
Party will attempt *o take over and mani-
pulate any peace movement,, no matter
how small. Thus the swamping of CND
meetings. If Miss Mclntyre will re-read
“War on the Peace Front” she will find I
stated that the Peace Committee, which
once looked down on the CND, became
alarmed at the publicity accorded CND
over its “Spies for Peace” stunt and
the fact that Trotskyites had worked their
way to leading positions in the CND.
If Miss Mclntyre is not aware of the
motion put forward at the Thornleigh
Conference in which the CND in effect
demanded at least an equal say in the
Peace Movement, perhaps Mr. R. Gould
will tell her of it. At the same time he
could explain how the Communist Eureka
Youth League has seized the initiative in
the Sydney University CND.
If Miss Mclntyre (whom I classify
among those I spoke of as motivated by
a sincere desire to minimise the chances
and causes of a nuclear disaster) does
not yet realise what is happening then
I do not envy her the heartache that the
inevitable realisation will bring.
YOUR SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
FITZROY
Sir,
Mr Andrew Millett, criticising my
piece, my amiable piece, on Fitzroy
(31/8/63), says I failed to mention
Deakin. Mr Millett has seemingly failed
to read my piece. I mentioned Deakin
prominently.
Mr Millett accuses me of having over-
looked the sins of other places. How-
ever, I pointed out that its failings were
shared by Richmond, Collingwood and
other areas, and that it had certain vir-
tues. Anyway, the piece was about
Fitzroy.
Mr Millett seems to think that I used
the term “crime and prossies”. This puz-
zles me. What is a “prossy”?
If the archives that Mr Millett men-
tions are keeping up to date, they have
received, since 1 wrote my article, a num-
ber of reports of Fitzroy happenings
which bear out what I said about the
place.

A “CRUSADING PETER PAN”?
Sir,
Mr Frank Roberts (24/8/63) spends
his time watching children’s TV shows.
He has a grudge against “The Happy
Show”. Perhaps this is because he misses
his favorite TV show, “Noddy”, or be-
cause he has missed “Kindergarten Play-
time”. Or perhaps he was once a kiddies’
entertainer until he found out that child-
ren do not understand Lennie Bruce-type
jokes.
Mr Roberts is a crusader-type Peter
Pan who has taken it upon himself to
reform children's television shows. I
suggest that he first poisons the fairies at
the bottom of his garden.

DORIAN LE GALLIENNE
Sir,
My few paragraphs on Dorian le
Gallienne (10/8/63) hardly represented
an article on the man and his music.
They were the briefest of tributes
prompted by his untimely death, which
may not have been known to your inter-
state readers. These readers will be glad
to have the corrections your correspon-
dent Joyce Garretty makes to my facts,
all of which were drawn from personal
recollection and unchecked. I hope, how-
ever, that they will be as puzzled as I
at the charge of unfairness which is made
against me.

“VANDALISM”
Sir,
The Sidney Nolan color prints
(24/8/63) were excellent. I don’t know
anything about printing, but I believe it
is an expensive process, involving an
art and great skill. If that is true, then
I consider it vandalism to put a crease
and staple through “Rimbaud at Harar”.
Besides “Batman”, Fernand Arrabal is
one of the few sane men who ever had
a word in the “Bully”. He is sane enough
to admit that he is mad, but “the madman
who thinks himself sane, he is called mad
indeed.”
Since I read the new Bulletin, it is
my wish to see Plain English written
by “Batman”.
JEAN CHASSELOUP
Bendigo (Vic.).
Sir,
I have just read your coverage
of Sidney Nolan’s African paintings
(24/8/63). From the point of view of
the Bonython Art Gallery, as well as
the general interest of the article, it
seems a pity that no mention was made
of the fact that Nolan will be exhibiting
a collection of African paintings for the
first time in Australia at the Gallery
during the Adelaide Festival of Arts in
March, 1964.

CHILDREN’S BOOKS
Sir,
Your reviewer Maria Wolkowsky, in
explaining the reasons for her incorrect
statement that two of the books she
reviewed had been “Highly Commended’’
by the judges of the Children’s Book of
the Year Award (24/8/63), implies that
later unspecified inquiries had revealed
that the books had indeed been “com-
mended”. I would suggest that she might
consult official sources. If the informa-
tion is not available to her through the
Children’s Book Council, may I refer
her to the Children’s Book Supplement
of Australian Book Review, July, 1963,
where the Judges’ Report on the awards
is printed.

THE ABORIGINAL LANGUAGE
Sir,
Considering the informed articles you
publish from time to time on matters
aboriginal, I was surprised to see the
statement in “National Notebook”
(17/8/63) that “no aboriginal tribe has
a written language” and still more sur-
prised that it has gone a fortnight un-
challenged. Of course no aboriginal lan-
guage was originally a written one. But
a number have been rendered so by mis-
sionaries and others interested. These are
not merely transcribed as museum
records, but are in active use.

Qantas helps Australian manufacturer
'collar'Asian shirt markets
Glo-Weave of Melbourne are exporting an increasing number of shirts to the Far East. You’d think
this would take some doing . . . selling their top-quality Australian shirts in such places as Singapore
and Hong Kong, where legions of businesses make and sell shirts cheaply right on their own premises.
Glo-Weave thus has to pin-point Far East requirements from a great distance, at all times. And does
so, with Qantas Air Cargo. Qantas frequency of service and speed ensure consignment delivery within
hours. Low special commodity rates enable Glo-Weave to fly shirts in presentation packs to Singapore
at only 2/7d. each. Lighter packaging, Qantas care of handling, and a turn-around of capital as quick
as Qantas flies help the sales of Glo-Weave shirts increase wherever they’re sold. Speaking off the
cuff, an Asian retailer said, “You can put your shirt on Qantas for completely wrinkle-free service.”

Around Melbourne
A RUINED WEEK (NO PARANOIA)
cities are called upon to suffer
the terrible shocks we have en-
dured these past couple of weeks.
First there was the strike by the State
Electricity Commission workers. Oh,
true, we didn't go entirely without
power. Wp were asked to play the
game by using only two electric lights,
our refrigerators, and electric stoves,
only if we really had to.
And, indeed, Melburnians did play
the game. One gentleman showed such
keen public spirit that he drove his
car into the city at night without head-
lights. A lady even called Station 3DB
to ask if it would be all right to use
her little transistor.
But the real agony was this. For
two whole nights TV was banned; the
first time in seven years, no television.
By choosing Wednesday and Thursday
nights for their stoppage the unions
showed devilish cunning. These are
very high-rating nights in Melbourne.
The medical week was utterly ruined.
Viewers were unable to see that not-
able neuro-surgeon, Ben Casey, dril-
ling holes in skulls. Even worse, they
had to miss out on Dr Bassett, the
brilliant psychiatrist, in “Eleventh
Hour.” That meant a whole week
without the usual heart-warming story
about paranoia or schizophrenia.
The crime week also was ruined.
No “Z-Cars,” no “Untouchables,” and
it promised to be a very fine episode,
all about Mr Ness trapping Fat Augie,
the bootleg baron. One Mrs Graham
Hawkins, of Mentone, was reported
in the newspapers as saying that it was
a nightmare without the TV . . . “I’d
never missed a night of TV since it
started. I didn’t know what to do.”
The radio stations did marvellous
business, just like old times. The ring-
a-record programmes never had so
many requests.
Television returned to us at 7.30
on the Friday morning. Then, just to
give back the poor viewers the glories
they had missed . . . Oh, yes, blast
you, you’ve guessed it already ... he
did . . . Mr Kennedy gave us his
“In Melbourne Tonight” before break-
fast. You are indeed a fine Graham
Kennedy fan if you can look at him
at 7.30 -in the morning.
All that now is just a memory.
There was worse to come. The fol-
lowing Tuesday was christened “The
Night of the Long Knives.” This was
the night of the tabling of the Royal
Commission report on the King’s
Bridge, also the night of the terrible
murder that was done at the Foot-
ball League’s Harrison House.
First, the bridge. How we waited
for this report! The £4 million bridge
cracked on July 10, 1962. A Royal
Commission didn't actually get under
way until October 1, 1962. It sat for
71 days and 2 million words of tran-
script. Then, incredibly, Mr Bolte
held up the report for two months
because he said he could not produce
it until after the winter recess.
It was something to see. Not only
was it 121 pages long, but, by golly,
it carried six pages of pictures
three of them in color. We’ve never
seen a Royal Commission report like
this; no dodging of issues, no white-
washing; a perfectly aimed block-
buster, all written in clear, precise
English. Take this for example:
“Such a failure should not have oc-
curred. It cried out for explanation
... we reject the theory, somewhat
diffidently suggested to us at one
stage, that the failure was due to
sheer misfortune ... we have also
asked ourselves whether we have been
judging these incidents by standards
that are too high for ordinary mor-
tals to reach and whether we are
demanding higher standards of com-
petence than we would from doctors,
lawyers or other professional men . . .”
X>ut perhaps the most charming
feature was this. Ray Noble, the
driver of the 45-ton low-loader which
actually broke the bridge, was com-
pletely exonerated. The report made
it clear that but for the low-loader
“the collapse could well have occur-
red at a time of peak traffic and re-
sulted in serious injury or loss of life.”
Why, Ray Noble was a public hero.
Sadly, he was unavailable for com-
ment. He was driving his low-loader
between Sydney and Melbourne, no
doubt thoroughly testing all the
bridges on the way.
At Harrison House the same night
there was the big trial. Ron Barassi,
the captain of Melbourne, Aus-
tralia’s most famous footballer, was
on trial for striking another player.
John Peck of Hawthorn, the great
full-forward, the leading goal-kicker
this year —69 goals—on trial for
abusive language. Also on trial were
Des Dickson, Hawthorn ruckman,
and David Rogers of Carlton. And
all this on the eve of the finals.
How the law courts must have
envied the drama and the publicity!
There were over 250 people outside
Harrison House. The “Sun” assigned
three men to the job, the “Age” three
men; the radio stations were there,
reporting live, the two commercial
channels were there, giving direct
telecasts. There were five policemen,
plus a mobile car to direct the traffic.
There were some interesting aspects
to it all. Ron Barassi was reported
for striking the Richmond player
Roger Dean by field umpire Barry
Gaudion. Now, the player’s advocate,
the man to defend Barassi, was
Charles Gaudion, Barry's father. This
meant that father had to cross-
examine son. According to the re-
porters on the job this was done to
no mean order.
The trials were reported word-for-
word, in rather more detail than the
Ward case. One memorable quote
from Barassi: “If I had wanted to hit
him in the face I would have hit him
with a straight punch. I had a perfect
opportunity to let him have one.”
The players were disqualified for
a total of 18 “team-shattering” weeks.
Barassi got four matches, Peck two
matches, Dickson four matches, and
Rogers eight matches.
Strange things happened outside
Harrison House. A tremendous roar
went up. At first, we were jubilant.
This meant, surely, that Barassi had
been cleared. No, it was the reverse.
This was a French guillotine crowd.
The partisan mob was cheering the
fact that he had been sentenced.
Barassi came out, hands in pockets,
stunned. He was very close to tears.
This was the greatest League tragedy
since the great John Coleman of
Essendon was outed on the eve of the

stumbled and hit his head as he came
down the steps. And he really did

The Rat Race
Struggles for the executives 9 washroom
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
How To Succeed In Business Without
Really Trying. Abe Burrows. Music
and lyrics by Frank Loesser. Her
Majesty’s Theatre. Melbourne.
Shelley Berman. Palais Theatre. St.
Kilda. Melbourne.
T. Pierpont Finch, the hero of “How
** to Succeed”, is first seen swaying
on a window-cleaner’s platform as he
studies a copy of “How To Succeed In
Business Without Really Trying”. Fol-
lowing the instructions, he chooses a
large company the headquarters of
World Wide Wickets Co. Inc. in down-
town New York. Starting as a clerk on
the bottom rung, he climbs rapidly to the
top. The method is simple: unremitting
flattery of those on the upper rungs com-
bined with ruthless stamping on the
fingers of all rival climbers. From clerk
to junior executive, from junior executive
to executive, and then on upwards. In the
“executive washroom” the other execu-
tives close their ranks against the man
who is letting the side down by trying
to go up the ladder too fast. But the world
is Finch’s oyster and in his “How To Do
It” book he has the simple instructions
for opening it. His fairy-tale success,
achieved by good wits and good fortune,
keeps as comedy what would otherwise
be a rather chilling picture of the execu-
tive on the make.
Len Gochman gives a delightful comic
performance as the fresh-faced, seem-
ingly guileless Finch, the best back-stab-
ber of them all. Edwin Steffe as J. B.
Biggley is everyone’s idea of a company
president, the simple-hearted tyrant,
harassed by his wife, by his idiot nephew
and by his red-faced solace, Miss Hedy
La Rue, played by Betty McGuire, the
worst secretary ever to put pencil to
stenographer’s pad. Annabelle Adams
plays the heroine who takes a realistic
view of her future life as an executive’s
wife.
Shelley Berman is the kind of
comedian who establishes an intimate
relationship with the audience. But
“intimate” is not exactly the word one
would choose to describe the Palais
Theatre. “This is a very large theatre,”
said Mr Berman, as he surveyed the
dimly-receding vista before him. “I have
been in some large theatres in my time,
but this is the largest large theatre I have
ever been in.” It is a measure of his
talent that he was able to mesmerise this
vast acreage of audience completely, in
spite of his evident dismay.
Anyone who has heard Shelley Ber-
man on record knows that he is very
clever and very funny, but it is necessary
to see him to discover what a really
brilliant comedian he is. You under-
stand those explosions of laughter on
the record when he was not saying any-
thing. Neat, graceful, an excellent mime,
his body and his mind both move like
quicksilver. He sits perched on his high
stool and the audience watches rapt as
he lights a cigarette.
His sketches are about the small dis-
asters, the embarrassments, the frustra-
tions which constantly beset the average,
sensual coward that most of us are: The
man at the dentist’s, the hypochondriac
with the cut finger trying to get hold of
a doctor at 4 a.m., the man with the
hangover ringing up his host the morn-
ing after the party to find out what
happened.
The programme note says he has been
compared to Charlie Chaplin, but I think
the comparison is quite wrong. Chaplin
presented the little man, buffeted by
circumstances, the whipping-boy of fate,
a kind of saintly simpleton, whose ad-
ventures swung between farce and
sentimentality. But Shelley Berman’s
comedy is both more realistic and more
tough-minded. Very often in his
sketches we identify ourselves with both
his characters: with the hypochondriac
and also with the doctor who has been
dragged out of bed in the middle of the
night, with the guest who has the hang-
over and also with his host whose flat
has. been wrecked. This presentation of
both sides removes any suggestion that
we are more sinned against than sinning.
Shelley Berman does not give us a
picture of a little man in a hostile
universe. He tells us that the embarrass-
ments and frustrations are due to our
own faults and to the nature of life.

rpo young people Sam Atyeo is little
more than a name, passed on to
them from the ’thirties. Shortly after
completing his studies he gave up paint-
ing altogether, and for twenty-five years
apparently produced nothing. His present
exhibition of gouaches at Georges Gallery
all date from 1960 on, and is the only
work to be seen here since he left for
Europe in 1935.
In spite of its brevity his early career is
memorable. Those who knew him speak
admiringly of his great personal vigor,
and it seems that this rebellious vigor
of his led him to become one of the
pioneers of modern painting in Australia.
A brilliant student, in the academic man-
ner of the early ’thirties, he horrified
the National Gallery Art School by
entering a nude painted in the modern
manner for the Travelling Scholarship. He
had been tipped, to win the scholarship;
instead he was as good as thrown out by
his outraged teacher, Bernard Hall. For
three more years he infused some rest-
lessness into the local scene, and moved
as far as complete abstraction (his
‘'Organized Line in Yellow”, painted in
1934, is in the Museum of Modern Art
collection). After his retirement from
painting he turned to the no less uncon-
ventional pursuits of diplomacy with
Dr Evatt and rose-growing in Southern
France.
Locally, then, his return to painting is
welcome, the more so because he still
paints very well. He is a particularly
engaging colorist, and his gouache
work is most accomplished. Mostly he
draws his themes from nature, apparently
caring little for distinctions between ab-
straction and figuration. It is immediately
attractive painting, and persistently re-
warding. The brightness of color and
the refinement of subject rarely lead to
prettiness or preciousness, although in
less firm hands it could very easily. For
the most part it communicates a warm
and disciplined lyricism which, without-
any attempt to shock, nonetheless makes
insistent demands with its many-’evelled
imagery.
At the Leveson Street Gallery, Helen
Maudsley has been showing a species of


domestic surrealism, somewhat redolent
of Edward Lear and John Tenniel.
Houses full of Victorian furniture are
made to hover in a final liberation over
the neat landscapes of dreams. It is not
on the whole remarkably good drawing,
but the imagination is persistent and in
the end one succumbs to it. It is indeed
a desirable world where the trees are
furniture and the landscape a carpet. The
taste for pale and grotesque figures in
painting seems to be spreading. No doubt
admiration for the English painter,
Francis Bacon, has had a lot to do with
it. In particular, the strong element of
horror seems to attract young painters.
Robert Rooney concentrates on the
human figure, distorted to varying
degrees and mostly floating or hanging
helplessly against a plain dark back-
ground. If the figures have any life, it is
usually rudimentary. They are bloodless
and often flat, more specimens with
human outlines than people. Some are
dead, one is part dog, another a paper
man, others hang by the feet like freshly
skinned mutton. Nonetheless, although
these figures lack dignity, they do assert
a strong claim to occupy the foreground
and to be distinguished from the sur-
rounding blackness.
Before this exhibition, Rooney was
known chiefly as a draftsman. The folio
here shows him to be an accomplished
and biting one. The painting at the
moment has no great depth of perception,
which makes his theme look repetitious,
but it promises to develop on a solid
base of intellectual vigour and technical
competence.
At the Argus Gallery Lindsay Edward
and Joe Rose run the gamut from figure
painting to abstraction. Brown is the
more settled and consistent painter both
in intention and technique. He derives
his forms from landscape, chiefly rocks
and tree-trunks, viewed either very
closely for their texture or from a dis-
tance for group arrangement. There is
no sharp division between recognisable
forms and abstract patterning in his
painting, and several works of both
kinds are quite successful. Too many, I
find, lack an essential rhythm. Some of
his larger forms have a certain presence,
like a totem, but are too isolated from
the rest of the painting. A few look to
be just paint, registering nothing more
than its presence on the board. Still, in
balance, his is a competent and sensitive
interpretation of landscape.
Joe Rose leaves too much to chance,
in the hope that variety in style will
compensate for lack of unity in ideas.
A host of influences crowd in on his
work and not all leave their best behind.
His figurative work is banal and need-
lessly garish, and his abstract expres-
sionism easier to take only because it is
less obvious. The few landscapes here
are the most promising material, fresher
and more subdued than the rest. He
needs a point of concentration to de-
velop out of his present eclecticism, and
these landscapes could well offer a way.
A very lively collection of young
minds all but one born in the ’forties
—has been invited (by the Museum of
Modern Art) to have a bash. This show
is almost a complete inventory of local
modern styles, especially of those which
can be done quickly and violently.
Assemblage of junk is obviously gain-
ing ground, with both serious and satiric
intent. No one especially stands out in
the collection, but there is enough solid
and adventurous work here to keep us
going for yet another generation.
“Urban Woman” is the theme of an
exhibition by Group M photographers—
by far Melbourne’s most ambitious group
of amateurs. By comparison with the
recent run of photographic exhibitions,
“Urban Woman” has two notable virtues:
a unified, absorbing theme and a re-
freshing, no-nonsense approach to the
art. Very often in photography one gets
the impression that advanced techniques
are used to convince us that the medium
is difficult and hence artistic. In “Urban
Woman” there are no special conjuring
tricks to admire, and it is obvious that
the group’s plain realism is a deliberate
rebellion. There is in this show a great
deal of honest and sympathetic observa-
tion of people. It should prove a con-
siderable, popular success. I hope it will
also have the more long-term effect of
keeping this eminently realistic art close
to life.

11/foTORisED paintings comprise the big
guns of this show, prominent but
few. Behind a screen of whipped-up cal-
ligraphy with holes spins a wheel of pop-
paste ups and oddments. Glass globes,
jars or bottles set in these holes, some-
times pro,ecting beyond them, distort
images through clear water in a similar
manner to curved mirrors. In the pro-
cess a new visual context is born, one
which draws up associational or mem-
ory scraps. Mesmerism replaces contem-
plation, the effect inducing the same big-
eyed stare as TV; both forms are a
little like a haunted fish tank. Racy
abstract patterns, however, are a little
superior, they change and disappear. Bits
of plastic help to split up bright color
and light.
A serious discrepancy between hacked
board, dry paint and the smooth bottled
image assists in the loss of unity. Foldes
is not profound in this gimmickry,
though his ideas might find serious
realisation in animated film. Somewhere
in a wilderness between popular
mechanical forms, window display and
painting these works exist. Neither does
the sometimes shaky movement really
add anything to painting which is
essential to its special, if limited, kind
of motion.
In a well-chosen selection of less
than a dozen paintings, English artist
Philip Sutton demonstrates qualities that
rate him high in critical estimation in
Britain. Some years ago his paintings
sang with mosaic-like touches of high-
keyed pigment, resonant and sensuous.
Now all density has fled, color areas have
broadened, have become light and thin
as if devoured from within. This gives
an underlying luminous unity of surface
which enriches even the densest blacks
or greys.

Duet
Two For the Seesaw. Director, Robert
Wise. Century Theatre. Sydney.
A Nebraska lawyer, alone in New
York awaiting his divorce, embarks
on an affair with a Greenwich Village
bohemian. The association, begun on his
part from loneliness and on the girl’s
from casual kindness, soon assumes
more importance. The man, cradled and
cossetted during his twelve-year mar-
riage by his wife’s love and his father-
in-law’s money, welcomes the chance
to shoulder the responsibility not only
for himself but for another human being;
the girl, whose injudicious generosity has
made her the victim of many men, hopes
that this is the start of a lasting re-
lationship.
But the man’s new sense of responsi-
bility, born of his association with his
lover, shows him what he owes too
to his marriage, and he is forced to-
wards a decision he knows must
infallibly injure one of the women, as
well as himself.
Robert Wise’s direction has kept in-
tact the warmth and wit of Gibson’s
play while revealing also a true feeling
for cinema. Especially worthy of note
is the sequence behind the credit titles,
with the lawyer wandering purpose-
lessly around New York, an eloquent,
understated evocation of the loneliness
of a stranger in a big city.
In bringing the play to the screen,
Wise has of course had to widen the
scope of the action: the camera moves
out of the lovers’ apartments and other
characters are introduced. But Wise
deftly keeps these other scenes and
people on the outskirts of the film; its
concern is with the relationship between
the man and the girl (and the man’s
wife, never seen but always present);
the details of their everyday lives are

Robert Mitchum's performance can-
not be too highly praised; this constantly
surprising actor brings a rare depth of
perception to a difficult part. In a more
obviously colorful and attractive role,
Shirley MacLaine is likeable and warm-
hearted, though perhaps the technical
mechanics of the performance are too
easily visible.
BEVERLEY TIVEY
MUSIC
Paternalism
Tn a just-issued Current Affairs Bulletin,
Mr Roger Covell, music critic of
“The Sydney Morning Herald,” accuses
the Australian Broadcasting Commission
of developing an “orchestral paternal-
ism” towards music in this country.
“The regime of each successive direc-
tor of music for the ABC”, Covell writes,
“has had consequences almost as far-
reaching in the realm of music as the
procession of Australia’s early authori-
tarian governors had for the country
as a whole.
“Just as the early governors controlled
and guided development in a way that
was not possible or necessary in the more
dynamic society of the young Ameri-
can States, so the ABC’s music depart-
ment, strongly influenced for most of its
history by the organisation’s general
manager, Mr (now Sir) Charles Moses,
felt obliged to fix its own goals and set
its own standards on the assumption that
it would take some time for the public
to catch up with them.”
This pattern of “orchestral paternal-
ism” has enabled the ABC to claim to
be the largest single concert-giving body
in the world. Every year about a mil-
lion seats are occupied (or at least re-
served) for concerts arranged by the
Australian Broadcasting Commission.
But “orchestral paternalism” has had
other consequences in our musical life,
some of which Covell approves, others he
disapproves. It has led to:
• A preponderance of orchestral
concerts over other forms of music. At
present, about 340 out of the 700-800
concerts given each year by the ABC
are orchestral. “This is an element of
ABC planning so long perpetuated as to
appear inevitable and immutable,”
Covell comments.
• Some not very distinguished sounds
from local orchestras. Covell claims that
the size of the State orchestras, apart
from those of Sydney and Victoria,
makes their description as symphony
orchestras “a matter of mere courtesy.”
On the Sydney orchestra he writes:
“As a hard-working radio orchestra it
stands up well to overseas comparisons
in most of its departments (the Victorian
orchestra seems some little distance be-
hind it on an average), but it could not
be listed at the moment among the gen-
uinely virtuoso orchestras of the world.”
• A scarcity of Australian conduc-
tors. Coveil says that the ABC must ac-
cept blame for its lack of foresight in
this direction.
• An obsession with “celebrities.”
“It is tempting (and perhaps necessary
from time to time) to accuse the ABC of
being obsessed with its status as an en-
trepreneur,” he writes, “and for depend-
ing so much on its ‘celebrities’ from over-
seas that its audiences are encouraged
to demand bigger and bigger ‘names’ as
the price of occupying their reserved
seats.”
However, as Covell points out, it is
“inaccurate to credit the ABC with in-
venting music in Australia, and equally
misleading to impute all musical ills to
its influence.”
On musical education Covell says
“the harm that is being done daily in
after-school lessons in a thousand Aus-
tralian suburbs is disquieting to contem-
plate.” But this situation, he believes, is
lightening a little. Enlightenment is mak-
ing its way into the State education de-
partments although Australian school
programmes tend to lag well behind de-
velopments in Britain.
In composition Covell sees an even
brighter light. After mentioning Scul-
thorpe, Meale and Sitsky, he writes: “For
the first time it is possible in all serious-
ness to suggest that Australia has avant-
garde composers. For the first time we
have composers working in this country
who do not sound as if they are lagging
a generation or so behind the evolution
of music elsewhere.”
PATRICIA ROLFE
TELEVISION
Benighted Daly
Towards the end of the first Delo and
A Daly Show a severe looking man
wandered on camera and demanded to
know how much longer “this folderol”
was going on. It was inserted as a bit of
planned nonsense but for my money it
was a good question and one that should
have been asked 30 minutes earlier, while
there was still some vague relationship
between the studio audience’s “gas” re-
action to the show and the viewers’ be-
mused response.
Somewhere in Melbourne, I suspect,
there is a portable studio audience com-
posed of people who will laugh or cry
at the drop of a hat and applaud on
command. Some local Svengali has em-
panelled it and hires it out to “Video
Village,” “It Could Be You,” and now
“The Delo and Daly Show.” Between
times it is stabled and given a diet of
corn mush and uncut hashish.
If that seems hard to believe, con-
sider the series of quick blackout
sketches in the Delo and Daly premiere.
A locksmith gets up to go home and
finds himself locked in, a woman is
shown jewels on black velvet and buys
the velvet, an immobile chess player is
nudged and falls over, an across-Aus-
tralia walker takes a few strides and is
hit by a car. These notions made the
Delo and Daly audience laugh so loudly
that the “models” who introduced each
blackout could hardly read their lines
from the board.
Later there was an interview with
Superman, and then another overlong
piece of nothing in which a proud
mother tried to get her prodigious little
daughter to sing, dance or recite, but
the child remained mute and immobile
behind an all-day sucker. Delo and Daly
led the audience in song and a short,
fat woman rushed the microphone and
sang emotionally and off key. At the
end, Jonathan Daly complained that
female guest stars always ignored him,
and Vikki Hammond appeared and
changed his mind.
This was most of the range of humor
on a new national variety show, featuring
Ken Delo and Jonathan Daly, supported
by five national sponsors and broadcast
by the Channel 7 stations in four capitals
from Brisbane to Adelaide. It was the
premiere of a new national variety show,
mind you, not a telecast of the Tiboo-
burra Revue Company, whose members
would have been ashamed to use such
material.
The show made me angry, but it was
not entirely hopeless. A singing and dan-
cing group called the Take Fives made
one good appearance. Delo and Daly
looked very professional in a couple
of song and dance routines, and their
comedy based on Daly’s prickly reaction
to being low man on the totem pole was
funny enough. But these small virtues
were not sufficient to sustain an hour
show.
The two principals were on camera
most of the time. The songs were from
Maggie Fitzgibbons, the Take Fives,
and Ken Delo, who should be restrained
from solos. The dances featured the
Latona group, briefly, and Delo and
Daly. The knockabout talents of Kitty
Bluett were buried in two pointless
sketches. And the rest was Delo and
Daly. Trying to carry the show, they
dropped it with a resounding crash.

Auden and After
The critic as aggressor
By LEONIE KRAMER
The Dyer’s Hand. W. H. Auden.
Faber and Faber. 655.
Tn his brief foreword to this collection
of essays, Mr Auden requests that
the chapters be read in sequence, since
their order is deliberate. I honored his
wish, but at considerable cost; for I
was often tempted to skip, and at the
same time compelled by a reviewer’s
conscience not to. Mr Auden’s recom-
mendation is not in his own best in-
terests. For to be asked to read “The
Dyer’s Hand” right through in order is
rather like being asked to read the Bible
in the same way, not omitting the “be-
gats.” But then one of Mr Auden’s tests
for a trustworthy critic is that he shall
really like the “begats” and not just ap-
prove of them on principle. So on this
ground alone I am disqualified as a re-
viewer of his book; and to make mat-
ters worse I heartily disagree with his
placing those dreary Biblical genealogical
tables in the same category as Homer’s
Catalogue of Ships.
This is a minor, though by no means
irrelevant, quibble with the terms on
which Auden asks to meet his reader.
For it has a good deal to do with the
kind of reaction one is likely to express
towards his book. I found “The Dyer’s
Hand” sometimes tedious (though in a
different way from the disputed passages
in the Book of Genesis!) and some-
times exasperating; and at least one of
the reasons for this is that Auden has
reduced his critical essays wherever pos-
sible to notes and aphorisms, in the be-
lief that “there is something lifeless,
even false, about systematic criticism.”
What he does not seem to have realised
is that there is something exceedingly ir-
ritating, and in the end boring, in plod-
ding through a series of aphoristic state-
ments, linked in a general pattern, but
not developed by argument or softened
by illustration. The first sections of the
book read like a dictionary of quota-
tions, where one is jerked from one
clever pronouncement to the next. Fur-
ther, like most epigrammatic statements,
these seem to contain more wit than
truth. One admires the way a sentence
is turned, rather than the thought it
expresses, which may often be either
commonplace or trivial for example,
“In literature, vulgarity is preferable to
nullity, just as grocer’s port is preferable
to distilled water.” Confronted with a
series of these pithy statements, one
could be pardoned for imagining that
Mr Auden has gone into business as a
copy writer for a desk-calendar firm.
These objections registered, one can
turn to the criticism itself, though not
without remarking that it takes some
time to overcome the initial impression
of patchiness and smart definition. The
reason why Auden wants his chapters
read in order is that he is writing not
just literary criticism, but what one
might call literary philosophy. He first
considers reading and writing, and then
moves on to a discussion of the poet
and his relationship to his poem (this
was his inaugural lecture as Professor
of Poetry in Oxford); then he tries to
define the nature of man, of communi-
ties, crowds and societies; and finally
he arrives at his critical essays. There
are groups on Shakespeare, on Ameri-
can literature, on comedy and on
musical subjects.
A uden takes the standard Leavis view
that “knowledge of an artist’s life,
temperament and opinions is unimportant
to an understanding of his art,” but he
also asserts that a “similar knowledge
about a critic may be important to an un-
derstanding of his judgments.” There is
some truth in this, though his illustra-
tion of it that we would find “The
Lives of the Poets” much less interesting
if we knew nothing else about Johnson
seems to me a poor one. A much
better example is “The Dyer’s Hand.”
Auden supplies a great deal of personal
information in his preliminary chapters
and in his criticism. Indeed, the over-
whelming impression made by his criti-
cism is of egocentricity. Some of it has
little to do with the quality of the litera-
ture under discussion, and a great deal
to do with Auden's view of the world
(his discussion of the detective story as
a parable of guilt and innocence is a
case in point). Most of it is therefore
exegetical, rather than evaluative.
Auden measures himself against sub-
jects which make severe demands upon
a critic’s powers. The central section of
sie book is a series of essays upon
Shakespearean topics under the general
title ‘The Shakespearean City”. Auden
places the emphasis upon the social mil-
ieu of the plays and upon the psycho-
logical pattern manifested by certain
characters and here his preoccupa-
tion with Freudian psychology is evi-
dent. The result is that the essays are.
both general and controversial. This is
certainly Shakespeare arranged by
Auden, and as such would not, I
imagine, be acceptable either to the
traditionalist or to the linguistic critic.
His angle of vision does, however, pro-
duce some novel views. In the essay
on “Henry IV,” for example, he invites
us to look at some of the characters
as they would have been seen by Fal-
staff had he been in the audience in-
stead of on the stage. His conclusions
are well worth pondering. But it is in
the essay on “Othello” that his critical
method is most clearly demonstrated.
He discusses, first of all, the motives for
lago’s villainy; he then analyses the
curious role of Roderigo; engages in an
apparently irrelevant digression on the
practical joker; and finally rejects the
purely Machiavellian interpretation on
the grounds that the play can in fact
no longer be read by the modern reader
merely in these terms. “To us . . . he
is a much more alarming figure. . . .
For is not lago, the practical joker, a
parabolic figure for the autonomous pur-
suit of scientific knowledge through ex-
periment which we all, whether we are
scientists or not, take for granted as
natural and right?”
This is a good example of the merits
and defects of Auden’s approach. He
forces us to view the plays primarily
as theatrical experiences, which is a
good thing; he places them in a new
personal framework, which is interesting
and provocative; but he so often leaps to
a conclusion to which I at least am re-
luctant to follow him; just as I am re-
luctant to accept that one can sum up
and account for Leontes by finding him
to be “a classical case of paranoid sexual
jealousy due to repressed homosexual
feelings.”
As one might expect, Auden is at
his best when he is less anxious to turn
observations into general truths, or
shrewd insights into psychological dog-
ma. When he is dealing with his own
subject poetry and with particular
examples of it, he shows himself to be
a discriminating and illuminating critic.
His essay on the poetry of D. H. Law-
rence is full of penetrating comments;
so are the essays on Robert Frost and
on Byron’s “Don Juan.” In all these he
succeeds in making verbal analysis fas-

cinating, and for the same reason I
found his notes on types of verbal
comedy and on translating opera lib-
retti (this last written in collaboration
with Chester Kallman) of particular in-
terest.
It is true that if one follows Auden’s
instructions, and reads his essays in or-
der, one finishes them with a feeling of
having observed the gradual unfolding
of a mind, roving with ease and con-
fidence over a range of subjects in philo-
sophy, psychology, literature and music.
But I think Auden over-estimates the
degree to which his essays are linked
and sequential. In certain respects they
are so; but they are also at times re-
petitive, and his essential views can be
grasped rather more easily than he seems
to suppose. And though he professes to
agree with Lawrence that a thought ex-
pressed aphoristically in prose can be
repellent, I do not think he is quite
aware of how aggressive he manages to
appear, especially in the opening overs.
If you can survive these, and take a
few short spells when he’s not looking,
you will meet in “The Dyer’s Hand” an
original and stimulating guide who, in
the course of expounding his subject,
says much that is revealing about
himself.
Partisans
From Gorky to Pasternak. Helen
Muchnic. Methuen. 755. 6d.
is so much that is excellent and
A stimulating in this substantial study
of six modern Russian writers that one
would like to concentrate on its large
virtues. Professor Muchnic carries her
erudition lightly, she writes with grace
and, up to a point, with empathy, and
she is honest about her preferences. She
implicitly accepts for her own criticism
the Marxist dictum that literature is a
partisan activity. But she is a metaphy-
sician, not at all a historian, even though
she commands all the data. To love
Pasternak is no sin, but to discuss Gorky
and Sholokhov, as she does, in what
are essentially Pasternakian terms is
bound to lead to distortions.
She has taken for her motto Gershen-
sohn’s view that what is wrong with the
Russian intellect is that it seeks man in
men, that writers, notably Soviet writers
until Pasternak, are not deeply enough
committed to themselves. Like any other
thesis this has its fruitful elements.
Where a true conflict exists in a writer
between his world view and his creative
genius, it can serve to reveal something
new about the contradiction which is
found in every great talent and usually
is an integral part of its power. Never-
theless, this does not apply only to Rus-
sian writers. Helen Muchnic looks for
the elemental failure and finds it in four
of her subjects: Gorky, Leonov, Maya-
kovsky and Sholokhov. Since she identi-
fies almost religiously with Pasternak,
who would have been rejected by all
four, this is a foregone conclusion. Alex-
ander Blok is the exception. Her essay
on him seems very fine, but is the hardest
to judge because Blok is, in this gallery,
the least accessible to the foreign reader.
Perhaps the author’s method is more
valid in relation to poets. In the case of
Mayakovsky it has certainly produced
a very vivid analysis, one of the most
persuasive I have read. Mayakovsky,
whom she rightly regards as a tragic
poet, presents in almost clinical form the
problem of the romantic. What destroyed
him was not so much his inability to
merge dream and reality revolu-
tionary dream and revolutionary reality
but to impose the former upon the
latter: he was killed by the cosmic vast-
ness of his own vision, in its way quite
as great or greater than Yurii Zhivago’s.
Spiritually, he ran himself to death
but Helen Muchnic admires inward
calm; the other, Christian transcenden-
talism (which led Pasternak to deny the
very principle of revolution, made him
“anti-historic” and, in my view, prob-
ably a much less significant novelist than
poet).
The Mayakovsky chapter has warmth
and brilliance, although I think it gives
too little weight to the masterly critique
of his position by Trotsky, who stressed
the artificial gigantism of much of his
poetry, with which he tried to create
the future with words; a hopeless way of
bridging the gap between two epochs.
But in dealing with Gorky and Sholok-
hov her approach falls to the ground.
She ignores too much. We may agree
that Gorky’s novels and plays are not
masterpieces (though “Klim Samghin”
and “The Artamanov Business” are,
surely, more formidable than she will
allow?) and that his best work is found
in the first volume of his autobiography,
but she makes it too easy for herself
by paying only cursory attention to his
short stories, on which his fame is se-
curely founded. Instead she concurs with
Chekhov’s opinion, expressed when
Gorky was just beginning to make his
mark, that the man would be better re-
membered than his work. Gorky is ac-
cused of mental limitations because
he did not struggle enough with himself.
It seems to me an entirely naive charge,
and extremely biased firstly, because
there was much more struggle than the
author admits she does not even
refer to the “God-seeking” debate that
involved Lenin, Gorky and Lunacharsky
and, secondly, because one must be
blind to deny the many-sided richness
of human conflict in Maxim Gorky’s
finest stories, the ones by which he has
to be evaluated. Gorky, according to
Miss Muchnic, is not a true artist; he
is hollow at the core. He forced himself
to create to a pattern, squashing his soul
in the process. Well, let us have more
such debacles !
In the case of Leonov, whom no one
would consider to be in the same class
as the others, there is some point in such
strictures, and it would have been valu-
able to place him in clear historic per-
spective as an important minor figure
in a period of revolutionary decline, of
the victory of Socialist Realism in its
official form. What is basically untrue
of Gorky is partly true of Leonov, at
least of the structure of his novels. It
is when we reach Sholokhov that I fin-
ally part company with the author.
Possibly, he has done things that
should be condemned; certainly there’s
a progressive decline in his work from
“And Quiet Flows the Don” to “A
Man’s Fate.” But to make out that in
the first-named his overriding aim is to
display the excellence of Bolshevism,
and that he achieves this by making
Mishka Koshevoi a politically successful
prig who lords it over Gregory Mele-
khov, the tragic hero, verges on the
stupid. On the contrary, Gregory, like
all the other Cossacks tossed about in the
storm of time, is treated with the most


THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF AUSTRALIA
FULL-TIME
POST-GRADUATE
UNIVERSITY TRAINING
The National Library offers valuable new opportunities
for appointment as Librarian to university graduates,
including the year’s full-time course of lectures and
practical work, required for the Diploma in Librarian-
ship at the University of New South Wales.
The National Library, an institution of high international
standing, houses its collection in Canberra. Detailed
planning is well advanced for the main block of the
permanent library building, sited on the shore of Lake
Burley Griffin. The new building has been designed to
accommodate an ultimate 11,000,000 volumes slightly
less than the present Library of Congress in Washington.
Qualifications
Applicants should have a university
degree, preferably with honours, and
should demonstrate their capacity for
a successful library career, com-
bining professional librarianship
with increasing responsibilities of
management.
Duties on Completion of Training
Acquiring and organising library
material of all kinds for use, refer-
ence, research and bibliographical
work in general and special fields.
Applications
Applicants should state full details
of subjects, years of study, gradua-
tion and working experience sup-
ported wherever possible by refer-
ences. Applications should also show
date and place of birth and particu-
lars of war service.
Salaries
Commencing salaries of Librarian
Grade 1 are £1,430 for a male pass
graduate and £1,491 for a male
honours graduate. Female rates are
slightly less.
Contract of Service
Trainees are required to continue
in employment for three years after
the completion of training.

moving understanding the very qual-
ity which sets Sholokhov apart —and he
has more “reality” than Mishka. This
is not at all contradicted by the brutal
objectivity of the historic canvas. Helen
Muchnic grants Sholokhov passion, but
not Tolstoy’s or Dostoevsky’s passion of
debate, claiming that “he does not stir
our reason,” which is as true as saying
that a horse is not a cow. Men, in novels
as in life, debate not only by words;
there are many roads to making ideas
explicit.
And so to Pasternak, “the freest,
wisest spirit of them all.” This estimate
cannot be proved or disproved, since
wisdom and freedom are philosophically
subjective. But even if it could be
proved, would it convince posterity that
Yurii and Lara are more lastingly in-
teresting than Gregory Melekhov or Ak-
sinia? It remains to be seen. One must
congratulate Professor Muchnic on her
devoted labor and her intuitions, but
she could do with a dash of Tolstoian
perspective.
DAVID MARTIN
Rat-trap
The Hack. Wilfrid Sheed. Cassell.
235. 9d.
Cockatrice. Wolf Mankowitz. Long-
mans. 20s.
peddling of popular trash is the
subject of both these novels. Where
the two authors part company is in their
use of the common theme. While Wolf
Mankowitz is content to plot the devious
ingenuities of a film-producer on the
make, Wilfrid Sheed digs deeper into
the causes, symptoms and after-effects
of journalistic hackdom.
Bert Flax, the anti-hero of “The
Hack,” is bored and disgusted with his
life as a free-lance writer of sentimental
stories, articles and poems not to
mention the “thoughts” eked out with
dots to plug the interstices of a fourth-
rate magazine. Bert is trapped. Physi-
cally, he is trapped in Bloodbury, New
Jersey, by his job, his wife, and their
five unattractive children. But he is also
trapped mentally and spiritually, be-
cause he’s not just an ordinary public
relations, advertising, or pseudo-literary
hack: he is a Catholic hack.
In the hope of finding a way out,
Bert looks to those around him. Betty,
his tired, non-Catholic wife, is sympa-
thetic and rational, but can’t see things
his way. Neither can his two old col-
lege friends one now a pious bigot,
the other a run-down playboy (whom
Bert tries to blame for it all, promoting
him to Satanic status). In the confes-
sional, Bert finds that the Church itself
is massively beside the point and scarcely
less menacing than its local opponent,
Bert’s rich, rationalist mother-in-law.
She is able and eager to support his
family: he need only admit that religion
has failed him.
Wilfrid Sheed presents this spiritual
horror story from a non-Catholic as well
as a Catholic point of view. A good third
of the book is devoted to Bert's wife,
Betty. She can’t pierce his fog of hypo-
crisy there is even a tacit pretence
between them that she enjoys having
babies but she can at least recognise
his real need for religion. To some ex-
tent she can even share it, “the craving
to be a bit queer, now and then . . .
crazily, purgingly queer.” Ironically, a
false rumor of Betty’s impending con-
version only hastens Bert’s eventual
breakdown.
Mr Sheed’s suburban New Jersey, with
its dreary Christmas snowscape, sharply
recalls the spiritual wastes of Graham
Greene-land. But “The Hack” re-
explores the territory with originality,
wit, and a convincing flow of detailed
observation.
A well-detailed setting is just what is
lacking in Wolf Mankowitz’s novel,
“Cockatrice.” The story is told in the
first person by Danny Pisarov, a film-
producer's personal assistant. He tries to
climb to lasting affluence by double-
crossing his astute but absentee em-
ployer. Danny has two aptitudes sex-
ual prowess and professional cunning.
In these, Mr Mankowitz aims to reflect
the rapacity of the film-business as a
whole. Yet somehow the peculiar taw-
driness of Wardour Street escapes.

Puppet-Show
Pull Down Vanity and other stories.
Leslie A. Fiedler. Seeker and War-
burg. 225. 6d.
Apparently for Leslie Fiedler the
usual pipe-contemplating pose on
the back of the dust-jacket is insufficiently
expressive. His baleful glare from the
photograph chosen, doubtless intended to
represent fearless iconoclasm, instead
evokes a party impression of Lon
Chaney, Jr., as the Wolf Man. Appropri-
ately enough, in these eight short stories
originally published between 1948 and
1962, Fiedler obligingly snaps and claws
at the shadowy dangers he sees lurking in
the path of the creative artist and fit-
fully sinks his fangs into his special prey:
the artist’s wife whose fatal love con-
sumes her mate.
Of the more personally - involved
stories, two mildly comic complementary
anecdotes tell of Hyman Brandler who
has eked out his small talent in the
Philadelphia Public Library scribbling
away endlessly at his novel about the
shoestore where he has worked since the
age of 14. And at 35, on the eve of
opening his own Bon-Ton Home Bootery,
he sadly sends himself a floral horse-
shoe inscribed “Success!” and shrugs
away the failure of his literary aspira-
tions.
Also written in the first person, “The
Fear of Innocence” discursively traces
a young man’s conscious rejection and
rediscovery of the pleasures of com-
placency. Having rebelled against the
world for its exclusion of himself he
realises that he loves the rejection for
its own sake. His coming to terms with
his Ph.D., bourgeois respectability, the
ghost of the friend who taught him envy
and, finally, the imperfections of his love
is recounted with a remarkable lack of
plausibility. By way of complication, an
enigmatic cross-reference to the Phila-
delphia shoestore suggests that either
Hyman Brandler, like a character in a
Priestley time play, exists on two
diverging planes or that over the years
Fiedler’s characters are not the only
victims of life’s confusions.
Less personal are three other varia-
tions on the theme of the wasting effect
on the creative artist of the society he
secretly either envies or despises. The
overwrought style of the opening story
is intended, one keeps hoping, as a
parody of that of its protagonist, Warren
Plotkin, a self-obsessed and emotionally
insecure contributor to Little Magazines
under the pseudonym of Warren Pease
(“Tolstoy, get it? I make, I am afraid,
jokes.”). Invited to supper by three
homely spinsters, he cruelly mocks his
admirers by arriving with an outsize pair
of false teeth installed in his otherwise
unexceptional face. Fiedler's ham-fisted
humor effectively inhibits the comic
possibilities of the bizarre situation.
The title story personifies Fiedler’s
concept of the sexual immaturity and
debility of American writing in Milton
Amsterdam, a teacher of literature in a
Texas prep, school. Not only has he
been cuckolded by a 15-year-old student
but his wife is about to tell all in her
first novel entitled “Love Among the
Cactus”. A pathetic attempt to prove
his virility forces him into the arms of
a woman who has already symbolically
emasculated her poet husband and who
renders him temporarily impotent.
After such excessive self-analysis-pity
and -congratulation “The Stain”, an
ingeniously constructed and vividly
described parable of racial intolerance,
glows with an unexpected feeling for
humanity. The remaining story, “The
Dancing of Reb Hershl with the Withered
Hand”, displays Fiedler’s authoritative
command of Jewish legend and mystique.
Fiedler’s skill with words notwith-
standing, his tendency to obscurantism
and his inability to breathe real humanity
into his characters reveal them all too
clearly as puppets trying hard to do as
they’re told but finding the baffling stage
directions and the over - complicated
script just a little beyond them. That
their creator holds most of them in con-
tempt is never in doubt. In more ways
than one “Pull Down Vanity” is a some-
what disenchanted picture of the literary
state of the Union.
JOHN BURKI
Art and Myth
Australian Painting Today. John
Douglas Pringle. Thames and Hud-
son. 31s.
At the price, “Australian Painting To-
day” is a worthwhile general intro-
duction to modern Australian painting.
The text I find too glib and the theories
too neat, but the illustration is mostly
sound. The 31 color plates are well se-
lected and adequately reproduced, al-
though the selection could have been
improved by including Tucker (who
rates well in the Introduction), and prob-
ably Fred Williams, Lynn and Hodgkin-
son, at least for the sake of greater
breadth. It is not, for instance, so good
a selection as Kym Bonython’s book,
and scarcely more up to date in spite of
being published three years later. Still
there can be no quarrel with the selec-
tion from the point of view of its in-
clusions. Clearly both text and illustra-
tion have suffered from the writer’s re-
moteness, and the selection of painters
has been influenced by Australian exhi-
bitions in England, particularly, I would
think, by the 1961 exhibition at the
Whitechapel Gallery.
Pringle’s Introduction, though avow-
edly modest in intention, makes quite an
ambitious essay. He starts from the thesis
that Australian painting, since 1935, has
developed into a national school (the
only one in the world). This he attributes
mainly to our isolation but also impor-
tantly to the singular character of the
land, the people and their history. He
finds the ancient desolation of the land
especially striking, and writes convin-
cingly about it. The people he finds an
ambiguous mixture of the practical and
the imaginative, of the Anglo-Saxon and
the Celtic. Their history is one of callous
violence and wild Utopianism. He is, for
instance, very keen on the Ned Kelly
‘"myth,” in which he finds (and claims
Nolan does too) echoes of noble anarchy,
Irish idealism, bush democracy, and a
few others that 1 for one had never
thought of. Admittedly these grand syn-
theses make good reading, and Mr
Pringle has been prudent enough to lo-
cate most of his evidence in the “Aus-
tralian unconscious,” which presumably
excludes at least native critics. Perhaps
l have repressed feelings of guilt, but
I still have strong doubts about the suc-
cess of Nolan’s and Boyd's mythmaking
which Mr Pringle makes so much of.
Still, the balance of Mr Pringle’s his-
tory is fairly just, even if he does be-
come too enmeshed at times in his nat-
ional solutions. The story must of course
be simplified, and in the process it is
prone to be overdramatised. Somewhere
around 1935 there is an explosion in
Melbourne, and during the ’fifties a
Renaissance in Sydney (led by Passmore
and Olsen). A more detailed work
would make it all look less exciting, and
a steadier concentration on painters,
rather than on movements, would shift
a lot of the emphasis. Leonard French,
for example, would not be pushed into
a postscript on “Non-conformists” by a
writer less interested in national con-
formity. lan Fairweather's place, too,
is vague. Generally the section on re-
cent painting is the weakest, and does
not indeed satisfactorily justify the book’s
title.
BILL HANNAN


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Not Enough Gold to go Around
More than ever, after a stubborn drain on its gold reserves,
the US is keen to back any plan to strengthen the
international monetary system. With America's striving
to reduce its balance of payments gap by at least three billion
dollars a year, it must be obvious this can only be achieved by
cutting down the outflow of dollars to the rest of the world.
In turn, this involves an increase in the balance of payments
problems of other nations.
To solve the current crisis of international “liquidity”, it
has been suggested that some
new international bank should
be created to establish new
deposits with itself which will
offset the US balance of pay-
ments deficit. These deposits of
at least three billion dollars
could be loaned to undeveloped
nations which, in turn, would
be expected to buy more from
the developed nations and so
put more money into circula-
tion.
It is all right in theory. But
some will argue that America’s
earlier effort to put money into
circulation on a similar basis has
not staved off the existing prob-
lem of a sluggish economy and
a payments deficit. The liquidity
crisis has revealed a strong pres-
sure on gold reserves, and it is
claimed there is insufficient gold
to back the current level of de-
mand for convertible currencies.
In fact, to relieve the pressure
on gold reserves, the US Ad-
ministration has been forced to
seek the co-operation of Euro-
pean banks to retain an increased percentage of their assets
in dollars, including short-term US Government securities.
T'he International Monetary Fund has not been able to help
the situation to any extent because its rules provide that,
except in the case of a borrower who draws funds, it cannot
hold more of any currency than was paid in at the time of
original subscription (75 p.c.). The Fund’s holdings of dollars
have almost reached that 75 p.c. level because other countries
paid off their debts in dollars and concentrated new borrowings
in other convertible currencies wherever practicable. With
more repayments falling due in 1963-64 the US Government
has been forced to obtain a standby credit with the Fund of
500 million dollars. When an overseas borrower repays the
IMF, the US Government will draw convertible foreign
currencies from the Fund, paying for them in dollars. The
country repaying its loan will use its own dollar funds to buy
the convertible foreign currencies from the US Government.
Without such an arrangement, overseas countries, who are
not permitted under the IMF rules to pay in further dollars to
the Fund, would be forced to buy gold from the US or pur-
chase other convertible currencies in the open market at some
extra cost.
The US Federal Reserve recently increased short-term
interest rates to make it less attractive for foreigners to hold
their assets in dollars. Also, the 15 p.c. Interest Equalisation
Tax is designed to restrict the
outflow of US funds into
foreign investment securities.
Tf the US Government can
relieve the strain on its gold
reserves, it may be able to relax
some of its restrictions in later
years. There are 60 billion
dollars of private US invest-
ments abroad and nearly 11
billion dollars in loans outstand-
ing. Interest and dividend re-
turns on these US funds was 4.3
billion in 1962 and is rising
steadily, all of which will help
the balance of payments deficit
(if other outgoings are curbed).
But the inevitable conclusion
is that the liquidity of outside
nations will be curbed while the
US restricts its outflow. With-
out gold or convertible cur-
rencies to finance their own
deficits, many countries will be
forced to restrict their expansion
programmes and cut imports.
With the “Kennedy Round”
coming up in 1964 to consider
tariff reductions, it seems that
many participants will be hard put to find room for higher
imports.
Boost in Air
Cargo Business
HThe jet age is re-casting businessmen’s opinions on the econo-
mics of shipping freight by air. A jet freighter on the
Atlantic run recently lifted 40,000 lbs, of cargo from New
York to London in just under 6} hours.
Cargoes now carried include bulky electronic equipment,
automobile parts, household goods, surgical instruments, news-
papers, machinery, baby chicks, pharmaceuticals, etc. Even
automobiles are shipped from one continent to another.
Evidently the intercontinental air freight business is expand-


ing rapidly because Pan American now provides 12 jet freighter
flights each week between the US and Europe and six between
the US and the Orient.
By lifting 57,200 lbs of cargo in a nine-hour flight to Tokyo
-—including canned food and wool suitings the jet cargo
business is proving that fast airways freighting is here to stay.
Australian exporters already are aware of its advantages and
have been sending lobster tails, prawns and other perishable
food items to the US. An Australian exporter listed in last
month's issue of “Horizons” offered to ship orchids anywhere
in the world. But there must be obvious opportunities for ex-
tension of all types of air cargoes.
Recent increases in shipping freights give added argument.
And the sophisticated demands of today’s fashion-conscious
buyers provides justification for shipping sportsgoods and
fashionwear as quickly as possible.
Typical example of catering to international fashion demands
is the marketing experience of Jantzen, the US-based sports-
wear manufacturer which operates 21 associated companies
in various parts of the world. Although this would appear to
provide excellent coverage for Jantzen products, the company
reports that it has a big two-way business between countries,
with most of the items shipped by air cargo. Sportswear is
shipped to France because customers like a label which says
“Made in USA.” Similarly, Jantzen swimwear is freighted
from France to the US because Americans like a “Made in
France” label.
Similar items are flown into the US from Switzerland,
England and Germany, the company reports. Sometimes Singa-
pore gets some items from the UK and fashion lines from
Hawaii. Australian-made shirts sell in Singapore in competition
with local and other imported shirts.
Price factors are not always a prime consideration, because
there may be an element of preference or prejudice in customer
buying. Judged by the increasing volume of air cargo business,
there are plenty of avenues for the exporter and importer to
explore.
Japan’s Cartels
Together Again
Japan’s three major Mitsubishi companies Mitsubishi
** Nippon Heavy Industries, Shin Mitsubishi Heavy In-
dustries and Mitsubishi Shipbuilding and Engineering are to
be allowed to come together again. The merger is expected to
be approved by the Government’s Fair Trade Commission. It
should become effective by next May.
The huge old Japanese industrial cartels were splintered by
the post-war Allied Government to diminish their tremendous
concentrations of power. Holding companies were dissolved
and shareholdings spread as widely as possible.
Now the Japanese Government believes size is a key to
competitive strength in its liberalised economy. Other businesses
will most likely follow Mitsubishi's cementing process, despite
complications arising from their considerable foreign commit-
ments.
An anti-trust crusade is being reversed!
RTZ’s Aluminium Plans
Help Australia
JJio Tinto-Zinc Corporation grabs a vigorous and rather
refractory bull by the horns in resolving speedily and
directly to fabricate aluminium in the United Kingdom.
Quick expansion and a resultant widespread oversupply have
become notorious throughout the whole aluminium industry.
A keenly competitive fever is also heightened with the
rivalry of stainless steel and plastics as well as other metals.!
Pricing policy stands continuously on its mettle. But energetic!
marketing still permits aluminium to contemplate a high growth!
rate.
Australia exactly parallels the world situation, its available
market facing mounting activities on the part of Alcoa,
Australuco and Comalco, the latter 50 p.c. owned by RTZ
through its 90 p.c. control of Conzinc Riotinto of Australia.
Comalco will gain a decided benefit from RTZ’s new
extrusion plant, to be built at Widnes, Lancashire. The metal
used is to come from the Bell Bay (Tasmania) smelter.
Up till now Australia has sent almost no primary
aluminium into Britain, two-thirds of whose finished output is
dominated by Alcan (a subsidiary of Aluminium of Canada)
and British Aluminium (owned by the US Reynolds Metal and
Tube Investments).
Bell Bay can now produce 52,000 tons a year. It will be
called on to feed the English plant’s 'initial capacity totalling
about 5000 tons a year of extruded sections. More than
£stg.soo,ooo has been allocated for establishment, though
much greater expansion seems envisaged already.
Only three months ago RTZ bought control of Alreco, one
of Britain’s largest non-ferrous distributors.
Design of the new extrusion plant incorporates the very
latest automated equipment, “planned to take full advantage
of the long lengths possible with modern motorway trans-
portation’’. Building starts in the middle of 1964 and the plant
should be operating by August or September.
At the end of 1962 some 6.3 p.c. of the RTZ group’s assets
was directed into aluminium, all the interests then being within
Australia. Comalco goes all the way from raw material
(Weipa bauxite) to fabrication of mill products.
RTZ regards aluminium as one of its major Australian
developments. The UK move clearly keeps Comalco in a
central position and must certainly aid a complicated marketing
situation.
Asian Markets Vital
To Export Growth
CiR John Crawford used his speech to the Agricultural
Bureau congress in Adelaide to emphasise once more the
vital importance of Australian exports to Asian markets. He
did not see it impossible that these exports might be lifted
£250 million by 1970.
Total export income from all sources would have to increase
between £250 million and-£4OO million in the next 10 years
in order to guarantee a gross national product growth rate
above 4 p.c. and pay for a rising level of imports, Sir John
argued.
Probable European trade blocs, together with Britain’s likely
entry into the Common Market, should turn Australia’s eyes
more and more to Asia. The interest was further encouraged
by the continued dominance of farm products in our exports.
Sir John surveyed the possible requirements of each Asian
country, particularly remarking the needs of Indonesia’s
economic development. This country, still living out its
political revolution, must soon turn more and more to basic
economic growth.
First demands from Australia could be steel and other metal
manufactures, turning to protein foodstuffs as incomes grew.
Most Australian export prospects in Asia still centre on
Japan, Sir John maintained. However, more trade treaty
relations should be sought with other Asian countries.
In addition Australia cannot in any way avoid its share of
the economic burden of aid programmes.


The Case Against a Restrictive
Trade Bill
No. 7 - Appeal To Prime Minister’s Principles
By ROGER RANDERSON
Sir G. Barwick
Spontaneous economic growth,
springing largely from private initia-
tive and enterprise, will provide more
resources for common social purposes,
and do more to advance Australia, than
will a central plan to regiment private
production, which is the underlying ob-
jective of the scheme that the Attorney-
General has been induced to sponsor.
Persons and groups must not be frus-
trated by arbitrary official interference
from trying out new things or applying
novel methods of making and selling—-
otherwise the nation’s economic progress
will be checked. This was the message of
the previous article in this series.
Order and some degree of regularity in
our affairs are clearly necessary. The
position I maintain is not that of philo-
sophical anarchism, as is wrongly suggest-
ed in some quarters where the basic
learning of economics is not compre-
hended.
Such orderliness is achieved by market
processes occurring within a framework
of conditions set by government. These
conditions are: Money that holds its
value, liberal trading across our borders,
the coherent laws of property, contract
and commercial instruments, together
with up-to-date legislation concerning
patents, companies and taxation.
The necessary stability “cannot be the
result of a unified direction if we want
individuals to adjust their actions to the
particular circumstances largely known
only to them and never known in their
totality to any one mind.”
The case against Sir Garfield Barwick’s
proposals on economic grounds is over-
whelming. They offer no discernible
benefits to employees or other consumers,
to businesses, or investors. In many
aspects the proposals threaten injury to
all these interests. The application of
such authoritarian controls, judging by
the experience of the United States
mentioned in the fourth article of this
series, would leave Australia stunted in
her youth.
However, the Attorney-General - now
talks of balancing “an economic benefit
to the public” against “a sociological
detriment” —thus confusing businessmen
still further as to what the Government
intends to instruct its officials to do to
them and their businesses.
Liberty, I should have thought, is the
highest sociological interest of all Aus-
tralians —and it is directly and indirectly
threatened by the proposed legislation.
As Lord Acton truly wrote, liberty is
“not a means to a higher political end.
It is itself the highest political end.”
Even if evidence (as distinct from wish-
ful thinking) were available to show that
an economic system regimented in the
manner proposed could lead to faster
economic progress, the threat to personal
liberty overrides this and demands that
the proposals should be rejected.
The fact that some other countries have
adopted similar business restrictions (dur-
ing periods of inflation different from the
monetary stability Australia has enjoyed
for some time, because of popular ignor-
ance about the causes of inflation) should
not influence us in the least.
T would still want Australia to be the
A freest country of all for our children,
even if the light of liberty were tem-
porarily eclipsed everywhere else.
The Attorney-General never spoke truer
words than when he told the gathering at
Melbourne University that he and his
colleagues had adopted an “ essentially
pragmatic” approach. No more meddle-
some or dictatorial measures could be
conceived.
By the way, he also “pragmatised” by
adopting and propagating a complete
myth as to the manner in which free
enterprise has worked in the post-war
period. From certain personal knowledge
also I reject the myth that there was ever
“chaos” here in the ’thirties when a wise
plan enabled the nation to adjust itself
in a world crisis, and recovery proceeded
steadily until the war began.
No man in a free society should be
branded as a criminal and convicted of
crime without a fair hearing in a prop-
erly constituted court of law, where in-
tent and all the circumstances are care-
fully weighed before guilt is found and
sentence passed.
No court in a free society should be
bound by a certificate as to facts found
by the majority of a mere administrative
agency, and thereby have evidence with-
held from it that might lead to the ac-
quittal of a person charged with crime.
These are not “windy generalisations
about British justice,” as an anonymous
contributor to The Bulletin deprecat-
ingly observed. They are essential safe-
guards of our liberty for which our
ancestors fought and even died.
Yet Sir Garfield Barwick —if our
Courts and the Federal Constitution will
let him—proposes to deprive businessmen
charged with List B and unregistered List
A practices of these safeguards. He was
still unrepentant on August 16, when he
discounted the “alleged harshness” of the
criminal sanctions, and did not think his
proposed penalties “either harsh or un-
just.”
Let no man shrug his shoulders, think-
ing that this fate is reserved solely for
businessmen, leaving him unscathed. The
bell tolls, too, for men who have little
or no property, should such disgraceful
legislation ever be introduced. Employees,
consumers and investors are all depen-
dent on private businesses, and even our
splendid civil servants.
Without the slightest doubt, officials
would have unlimited discretion to con-
trol prices, capital issues and all other
business arrangements—thereby directing
private productive processes generally.
And no one can doubt the correctness of
Hilaire Belloc’s insight that “the control
of the production of wealth is the con-
trol of human life itself.”
We may pay high prices at times for
some things produced by free enterprise,
but it enables us to get most things for
a price. A centrally-planned system
greatly narrows this range of choice, and,
as has been well said, substitutes “ orders
and prohibitions which must be obeyed
and, in the last resort, the favor of the
mighty.”
“In a competitive society the prices
we have to pay for a thing, the rate at
which we can get one thing for another,
depend on the quantities of other things,
of which, by taking one, we deprive the
other members of society. This price
is not determined by the conscious will of
anybody. And if one way of achieving
our ends proves too expensive for us, we
are free to try other ways.”
The Attorney-General’s scheme would
never have done for the Mr Menzies of
14 years ago.
In the famous but now almost for-
gotten policy speech of 1949, Sir Robert


Menzies declared that “every extension
of Government power and control means
less freedom of choice foi the citizen.
Government activities are monopolist . .
“Are we for the Socialist State, with
its subordination of the individual to the
universal officialdom of Government?”
he then asked: "or are w'e for the ancient
British faith that Governments are the
servants of the people . . ?”
The public’s resounding answer at that
time gave Sir Robert the opportunity to
form his second Ministry, which is still
in office.
It was his proud and justified claim in
1949 that “the best years of my life have
been given to what I deeply believe is a
struggle for freedom.”
Perhaps Sir Robert Menzies will, there-
fore, bear with one W'ho since long before
1949 has followed the same star and by
now feels entitled to ask: “Where do you
stand in regard to the Attorney-General’s
proposals?”
With Government printing presses
churning out Sir Garfield’s pamphlets for
public distribution it seems that a fifth
has yet to come the Prime Minister
surely cannot remain silent any longer.
His intervention must be decisive in
the matter.
We are driven to re-examine Liberal
principles and test the Attorney-General’s
scheme against them, because he claimed
at Melbourne University that a great
many of the trade practices reported to
him were “alien to the political convic-
tions which, as a Liberal, I hold as to
the principles on which a free enterprise
economy can and should be organised.”
Perfectionism, unreal claims of ur-
gency, distrust of private businessmen
and lack of tolerance towards non-official
opinions (except those of clearly identi-
fiable economists and lawyers) have been
features of Sir Garfield's campaign. He,
too, is more tendentious than judicial
in his approach to this matter.
'Evidently, private persons can no
longer be trusted to use their own
property, or exercise freedom to contract
and join together in trade associations,
even when all their actions are peace-
able and law-abiding.
Did not Sir Garfield state at Melbourne
University that the question “ whether a
practice is contrary to the public inter-
est” (or beneficial for the public) “cannot
be left to the opinions of the parties
who, in pursuit of their private interests,
engage in it”?
“Anti-trust” is the essence of his pro-
posals.
They stand condemned in the light of
the following principles enunciated by
the greatest modern exponent of liberal-
ism:
(1) “Ambition, impatience and hurry
are often admirable in individuals; but
they are pernicious if they guide the
powers of coercion and if improvement
depends on those who, when authority is
conferred on them, assume that in their
authority lies superior wisdom and thus
the right to impose their beliefs on
others.”
(2) “It is because every individual
knows so little and, in particular, because
we rarely know which of us knows best
that we trust the independent and com-
petitive efforts of many to induce the
emergence of what we shall want when
we see it.”
(3) “It is because freedom means
the renunciation of direct control of in-
dividual efforts that a free society can
make use of so much more knowledge
than the mind of the wisest ruler can
comprehend.”
(4) “It is, indeed, part of the Liberal
attitude to assume that, especially
in the economic field, the self-
regulating forces of the market will some-
how bring about the required adjustments
to new conditions, although no one can
foretell how they will do this in a particu-
lar instance.”
npHERE I have quoted extracts from
the recent work of Professor F. A.
Hayek, The Constitution of Liberty.
He is, I am proud to claim, a friend and
teacher from pre-war days.
More particularly, the proposals are
condemned because they infringe the
Objectives set out in the Constitution of
the Liberal Party of Australia.
Section 3 (c) (i) refers to “Parliament
controlling the Executive , and the Law
controlling all.” This objective is in-
fringed by an attempt to by-pass the Con-
stitution. when all Liberals should sup-
port the Federal principle as a means of
preserving liberty, which Sir Robert Men-
zies firmly stated in the 1949 policy
speech already mentioned.
The Attorney-General gave an instance
showing that “in a limited field scope
was found for the existing Commonwealth
legislation.” and added that “the States,
of course, have at all times had unquali-
fied law-making authority.”
Without a referendum, or a general
referring of powers by the States (as pro-
vided in the Constitution), he now seeks
enlargement of the powers of the Central
Government on the censorious ground
that the States have not exercised their
authority “effectively, and in some cases
not at all.”
Further departures from the Party’s
objective set out in Section 3 (c) (i) are
involved in subordinating the Courts to
decisions by administrative agencies, and
in delegating to officials the power to
“make laws for particular cases,” simply
because, as the inevitable result of un-
defined purposes and inability to lay down
general rules, arbitrary government by
the Executive must supersede Pari ia-j
mentary control.
The Barwick scheme also infringes the
Liberal Party's objective of “freedom .. .
of association” in Section 3 (c) (ii) of its
Constitution, as already indicated.
It is quite absurd to describe private!
business arrangements as “controls on
the same order as the Government con-j
trols they supplanted,” when they are;
vulnerable to competition and not en-
forced by the sovereign powers of govern-!
ment.
“Freedom of citizens to choose their
own way of living and of life, subject to
the rights of others” [Section 3 (c) (iii) ]
is also infringed.
isolated case of an unbalanced
Dutch migrant who burned his factory
in South Australia is a poor reason for
the proposals. Opportunities for people to
start businesses are greater in Australia
than in most parts of the world. The
places in the community to which mi-
grants generally have risen in a short
time are well known. Indeed this is one
of the reasons for the continuing stream
of migration.
Unofficial codes of business ethics
should be sufficient to deter the general
adoption of offensive provisions restrict-
ing the entry of migrants into trade as-
sociations, and. even if legislation were
necessary, South Australia has more than
sufficient power to handle the matter
itself.
“Freedom, as Hayek states, “neces-
sarily means that many things will be
done which we do not like. Our faith >n
freedom does not rest on the foresee-
able results in particular circumstances,
but on the belief that it will, on balance,
release more forces for the good than
for the bad.”
One of the Liberal Party’s objectives
is “protecting the people against exploi-
tation” [Section 3 (c) (iv)]. Articles 2
and 6 of this series clearly show that there
has been no exploitation of consumers
to justify the scheme.
The Attorney-General’s assertions that
"prices tend to be unrealistic,” “deter-
mined on an arbitrary basis” and are not
“regulated by the natural forces of supply
and demand” (although encouraged by
the writings of Dr Coombs and by
judgments of the Arbitration Commis-
sion, following him) are positively in-
correct.
Sir Garfield has to admit: “I do not
wish to be taken as having formed a con-
clusion that prices are generally, or in
particular industries, too high. I have, in
fact, formed no such conclusion . .
But, on the bad advice he has received,
he claims that there is “a risk” that con-1
sumers may be exploited. The security of
a prison camp is scarcely to be preferred
to a mere risk, when the good life is]

full of risks, cheerfully accepted but
which seldom issue in disaster.
Fortunately, the Attorney-General has
now made it abundantly clear that he is
not “looking primarily to the encourage-
ment of individual initiative and enter-
prise,” but to their restriction, so that
everyone at last has notice that Section
3 (c) (v) of the Liberal Party’s objectives
would be breached by the adoption of
his proposals.
Action that can be effectually taken to
curb monopolistic powers of discrimina-
tion, according to Hayck, “must take the
form of . . . gradual improvement of our
law of corporations, patents and taxa-
tion . . .”
This great and well-informed scholar
(who technically is one of the world’s
greatest economists) is “increasingly
sceptical” of any discretionary action
against particular monopolies and “seri-
ously alarmed” at the arbitrary nature of
policy limiting the size of individual en-
terprises, while he regards it as “an
absurdity” that large American firms are
afraid to compete by lowering prices be-
cause this may involve them in anti-trust
action.
Certain capacities, advantages and
traditions possessed by persons and
businesses cannot be duplicated, just as
certain goods are scarce. “It does not
make sense,” Hayek states, “to disregard
this fact and attempt to create con-
ditions ‘as if’ competition w ; ere effective.”
Thus he answers the peculiar doctrine of
“effective” or “workable” competition
which Sir Garfield adopts uncritically
from the report of an American com-
mittee on anti-trust laws.
He points out that the record of
governments is so deplorable in creating
obstacles to entry into a market and in
price discrimination that “it is astounding
that anyone should still expect that
giving governments discretionary powers
will do anything but increase these
obstacles.”
It has been the experience of all coun-
tries that discretionary powers over
monopoly soon lead to “protecting the
supposedly good” more than preventing
the bad, he adds.
Personal liberty is insecure when pro-
ductive processes are thus dominated by
governmental favors and prejudices.
These, then, are the grounds of prin-
ciple on which, I submit, the Attorney-
General’s scheme should be abandoned.
This is the most vital issue for the
people of Australia that I can recall since
the great struggles of the forties over
Dr Evatt's “powers” referendum of 1914
and the attempted nationalisation of the
banks between 1947 and 1949.
The cause of liberalism in this coun-
try would be less likely to suffer in the
long run if the Menzies Government lost
the next election (although this need not
occur) than if the scheme were adopted
by carrying expediency so far as to cause
the Government to abandon its principles
altogether.
Enigma of Private Investment
Bulletin does not question the
accuracy of the Commonwealth
Statistician’s figures for fixed private in-
vestment last year, but the increase from
£lOBB million to £1228 million shown
in the national accounts does seem to
elre the testimony of the Bank of New
South Wales four-monthly surveys taken
over the year particularly so because
figures for motor vehicles used for pn-
vate purposes have been deducted for
both years and included in the national
accounts under personal consumption.
This increase of about 13 p.c. over
1961-62 (admittedly a very poor year)
puts fixed private investment £59 mil-
lion higher than the previous peak year
1960-61, and on the face of it makes
nonsense of the general impression from
industry that this was the most sluggish
item on the economic scene last year.
Unfortunately the Statistician does
nothing to resolve the query because
for the first time in his quarterly esti-
mates of national income and expendi-
ture, the latest (June quarter) omits pre-
v 'ous detail of the industries to which
the investment relates, except in the case
o building.
As for housing, while still below the
£333 million registered for dwellings in
1960-61, there has been a modest in-
crease of £23 million to £322 million
in 1962-63, with an almost steady ex-
penditure of £BO-£Bl million a quarter.
The Statistician’s building figures seem
accurate, but what about the rise from
£560 million to £645 million in other
fixed private investment last year for
which no details at all are available?
Somewhere along the line in the grand
total of £7925 million of gross national
expenditure, the Statistician admits a
“statistical discrepancy” of £7l million
overcounting. Would it be possible that
it occurred mostly in adding up the
amounts spent by industry on plant and
equipment during the year?
It will be interesting to see what the
Bank of New South Wales’ next report
on the state of capital spending by busi-
ness has to record. Has a great spurt
taken place without the capital markets
feeling the pulse of it and been financed
largely internally by companies, through
depreciation allowances, up from £586
million to £619 million on the year, and
undistributed company income whose in-
crease has not been disclosed so far?


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Mastering the Money Balance
The Authorities are Still Unsatisfied
all the brave words of the Eco-
nomic Survey, the Budget and the
latter’s defenders in the debate, after
further scrutiny of the very much down-
to-earth annual report of the Reserve
Bank it is obvious that the monetary
authorities are still unsatisfied with their
degree of mastery over what can loosely
be called the money balance.
“On many counts,” said D r Coombs in
his report, “the needs of balance were all
met in 1962-63,” thus echoing thoughts
expressed in these columns before the
Budget. “However,” he went on, “we are
not yet making full use of available re-
sources and there is scope for further
growth in expenditure.”
Moreover, while Dr Coombs thus
admits more frankly than the Treasurer
that there is urgency in the need to get
more idle resources into employment, he,
like the Treasurer, is inclined to think
the stage is set for “increased borrowing
for expenditure” to do this. Hence in the
Reserve Bank report there is no sug-
gestion of further easing of borrowing
terms, just as in the Budget there was
nothing to tip the scales of entrepren-
eurs’ confidence in the propitiousness of
the present state of the marginal effici-
ency of capital.
Treasurer and the Bank Governor,
therefore, appear to be on all fours
in their opinion that the economy has
enough steam in it without inducements
either from fiscal or monetary policy to
propel itself into higher ground. For,
coming after the Budget and finding that
document deficient in inspiration for the
private sector, Dr Coombs would surely
have given some pointer to the need for
some further inducement from monetary
policy to speed-up the employment of
idle resources.
Instead, looking ahead, he sees the
outlook in these terms. “Some expendi-
ture such as motor vehicles and non-
dwelling construction may tend to grow
less rapidly, but on the other hand con-
sumption is continuing to grow, public
authority expenditure is expected to rise,
stocks are not unduly high and the flow
of finance from the major lending insti-
tutions and Governments has recently
been increased. Although there is still
hesitancy in some industries, the gener-
ally reduced cost of finance, resulting
from the reduction in interest rates ir the
closing months of the year, and the con-
tinuing availability of institutional fin-
ance are favorable to increased borrow-
ing for expenditure.”
Thus, although before the Budget the
authorities were told quite bluntly by
industrial and commercial leaders that a
big gesture was required to stimulate
confidence so as to lift activity to new
levels and to provide the increasing num-
ber of job opportunities required by the
rapidly increasing work force, they are
quite content to let matters ride as they
are on both fiscal and monetary policy
fronts. In other words, they are saying
that the private sector is reading the
signs of the marginal efficiency of capi-
tal all wrong but will, without further
inducements on their part, soon be read-
ing them right.
intriguing thing is that, excited by
the strong showing of industrial pro-
fits since the Budget, most of the authori-
ties’ critics, including Mr Staniforth
Ricketson and some of his friends in
the Sunday Press, have been swayed over
to thinking that perhaps a helping hand
from the authorities was not really need-
ed at all and that from now on the priv-
ate sector will do the necessary after all.
Everybody will hope this volte face will
be justified by events.
Of course, the whole case for the
authorities’ reluctance to loosen the reins
further at this stage lies in their pre-
occupation with inherent dangers in the
high degree of liquidity in the economy,
which could explode in their face in the
event of both consumers and companies
dropping their cautionary dispositions
towards spending. That, as pointed out
before the Budget, was always the reser-
vation to be mindful of before pre-
dicting a confidence-boosting Budget.
Dr Coombs is surely as much pre-
occupied with it as Mr Holt, as witness
the following from the Reserve Bank’s
report:
“The private sector’s holdings of liquid
assets rose strongly during 1962-63.
Budgetary policy and banking movements
placed more funds in private hands and
the community continued to show a pref-
erence for liquidity and safety in the dis-
position of funds. The growth of liquidity
has made consideration of economic and
monetary policy more complex; it has
arisen partly as a result of measures
taken to encourage recovery; has reflect-
ed hesitancy within the community,
which has tended to impede recovery;
and has given rise to conditions which
could pose problems for policy at a
later stage of recovery.
“Monetary policy in 1962-63 was
directed primarily towards encouraging
the growth of economic activity. How-
ever, the liquid condition of the economy
could not be disregarded. Thus banking
policy sought to maintain a relatively
high rate of lending, but also to moderate
the rate of increase of undrawn overdraft
limits, which supplement private liquid-
ity, and of bank liquidity. Again, in deci-
ding to reduce interest rates, the desir-
ability of taking the opportunity presented
by trends in the capital market to reduce
the costs of finance had to be weighed
against the fact that interest rate deduc-
tions could tend to increase the potential
danger posed by relatively high private
liquidity.
“Liquidity remains high, making it
easy for the community to increase its
expenditure sharply should its attitudes
and expectations change. Part of the
defence against a change in attitudes
threatening the balance of the economy
lies in maintaining stability of prices and
flexibility in interest rates. We must look
to these defences. If recent attitudes en-
dure and become associated with a dis-
position to save that is consistently great-
er than in the 19505, this could provide
the basis for an expansion of private and
public investment favorable to a high
rate of economic growth.”
Vet Dr Coombs, who has no political
A throne to think of, can openly reveal
some misgivings about the state of Den-
mark.
“The increase in economic activity in
1962-63 had encouraging features, with
further progress towards achieving full
and effective use of the work force and
physical resources while preserving stabil-
ity of costs and prices. However, unem-
ployment is still too high. It is necessary
to follow through with policies to en-
courage the growth of economic activity
and to realise the potential for expansion
of the economy presented by the high
level of new entrants to the work force
in years to corr.e.”
Does he mean new policies, or is he
content with the old ones? He doesn’t say.
But perhaps this year he may get his
way a little earlier on any change in in-
terest rates he may consider necessary
and not be sidetracked as last year by
the Treasury.

Customlife Assurance Annual Report
reflects company growth:
• Combined surplus £306,229
• Significant broadening in
spread of investments
• New business £7,215,014 in
1963
• Policy Holders reserve in-
creased to £931,613
Customlife Assurance Limited
wrote £7,215,014 of new busi-
ness in the year ended March
31, 1963, the Company’s
fourth year as a life office.
At that date, the total new
business in force throughout
Australia was £39,168,486.
Customlife now has branches
established in all state capital
cities, Canberra and Darwin,
in suburban and country
centres throughout the nation,
and in London.
Commenting on the report,
General Manager, Mr. P. H.
Potts said, “We take consider-
able pride in the Company’s
continued development. We
believe such an outstanding
year is a pointer to future pro-
gress at an accelerating rate.”
Aid to Housing
One of the most notable
features of Customlife’s busi-
ness during the latest financial
year was its contribution
towards Australia’s growing
housing needs. The company
increased its loans for houses
during the year by 137 per
cent from £330,182 to
£782,571. The total of these
loans represented 32.5 per cent
of the total assets at March 31,
1963, £2,405,373 compared
with 16.5 per cent of the
£2,007,327 total assets a year
earlier.
Total Income
Premiums received by the
company for the year totalled
£619,047, while income from
investments was £133,729,
making a total income for the
year of £752,776. Claims
paid amounted to £92,151.
Combined Surplus Increase
Combined surplus disclosed by
the valuation was £306,229,
which has been allocated as
follows:
Bonus Fund .. .. £51,581
Surplus c/f in the Life
Fund £138,602
Surplus c/f in the In-
vest. Fund .. .. £116,046
£306,229
Policy holders’ reserve stood
at £931,613 at March 31,
1963, an increase of £282,516
above the level a year earlier.
The company declared an
increased compound bonus
rate of up to £22.10.0 per
£l,OOO assured on all partici-
pating policies.
Spread of Investments
Customlife’s balance sheet dis-
closes significant changes in the
use of assets during the year.
Apart from the big increase
in loans for housing purposes,
it is noticeable that the amount
of cash kept on deposit in
current account has been con-
siderably reduced and put to
more profitable use.
Where cash amounted to
£283,936 or 14.1 per cent of
the total assets at March 31,
1962, a year later it was only
£59,407 or 2.5 per cent of
assets. Investment in Aus-
tralian Government securities
remained steady at £236,146
and investment in Australian
semi-Government securities
increased from £148,000 to
£169,100.
Investment in Public
Companies
Customlife invested in shares
of public companies for the
first time in 1962-63, and by
March 31 the amount had
reached £178,318, representing
7.4 per cent of total assets.
Over its wide range of diver-
sified securities, Customlife re-
ceived a return of 6.7 per cent
before tax during the year.
Fixed assets (at cost less
depreciation) were increased
from £34,703 to £40,033.

A Port Ripe for Development
\7 ictoria’s Attorney-General, Mr A. G.
* Rylah, has rightly been attacked by
the Victorian Employers’ Federation for
describing as “tremendous” the efforts
of the State Government over the last
eight years to develop the country dis-
tricts of the State. Only in the sense that
the Government has been spending a fair
share of the available money on country
schools, water and sewerage, agricultural,
health and other essential services does
the VEF concede that no criticism is
necessary.
Although there are examples of new
industries being established in the coun-
try, it is far from being the wholesale
kind of development which could ac-
curately be defined as “tremendous” ac-
cording to the Federation. And it must be
agreed because although one-third of Vic-
toria's population lives outside the met-
ropolitan area, industrial employment out-
side the metropolitan area has been
growing in the last few years at about
only one-fiftieth of the rate of that with-
in it, where industry has been leaping
faster than any other metropolitan area
in Australia.
Now that the Portland Harbor Trust’s
£7 million project to construct a modern
marine terminal less than one hour’s sail-
ing from Australia’s main trade route
is well on the way to completion, the
case for strong measures to build up
industries and an industrial population
in the district is unanswerable.
On the other hand, as the VEF says,
you have in Melbourne a “metropolitan
complex which now threatens to choke
itself with its own problems,” but in the
face of which the State Government has
been able to find only about 1/4200th
part of its revenue to encourage the es-
tablishment of country industries through
freight concessions, loans, subsidies for
power and light and other assistance.
But, you have behind Portland
a hinterland of some 35,000 square
miles, some of which is the rich-
est country in Australia. Its natural trade
outlet is Portland Harbor, but by an ac-
cident of history it has until recent years
found most of its trade re-orientated
through the State capital on which Vic-
toria’s railway system was built to con-
verge. And even if the number of ships
passing through the port has increased
fourfold since 1955, numbering 95 ves-
sels last year, this is less than two a week,
whereas many times that number could
be accommodated.
In fact, Portland Harbor, like its wool
selling centre, looks all dressed up with
nowhere to go.
At the moment the only industry worth
talking about is frozen meat processing,
cheese and butter making, and a small
fish cannery, employing fewer than 700
in all of the 7000 population. But plans
should be pressed forward for a wider
range of secondary industries based pos-
sibly on wool, grain, timber (in which
the country back of Portland is particu-
larly rich) and possibly petroleum, for
which Portland is becoming an increas-
ingly important distribution centre, all
companies except Caltex having distribu-
tion facilities there.

INVESTMENT SECTION
“What is a Good Return?”
TTnder the above heading a prominent
Melbourne broker attempts to decide
what constitutes an acceptable yield on
prevailing markets. He comes up with a
minimum 31 p.c. as reasonable, pointing
out on the way that recent months have
seen some institutions cut their required
yield from ordinaries by i p.c.
The lowering of interest rates has
naturally influenced the possibilities of
investors’ demands among equities, lead-
ing also to a search for meritorious
second-liners. Here returns are a good
deal better than those from traditional
and popular leaders.
Investors can very properly be warned
that the palmy days of a multitude of
capital issues and quick expansion will
not be visible for a while yet. Their
correct technique is now to attend to
income and not try always to discover
“growth stocks.”
Perhaps all this looks too tame and
sober. It can’t be gainsaid, however, that
“companies with a good background of
results may be expected to move forward
rather than backward under the sound
conditions now established.”
Wot, No Share Issue?
Shareholders at first sight could be
pardoned for looking a little askance
at Woolworths’ private placement of
£4 million of registered unsecured notes,
the largest such issue ever effected in
Australia. The notes run for 12, 15 or
25 years and carry 7 p.c. interest.
The placing broker, A. C. Goode and
Co. of Melbourne, apparently found a
ready market among the institutions,
which are leaning away from heavy
share investment at the moment. They
get a satisfactory income while Wool-
worths itself gets cheap long-term funds.
These will, in the company’s words,
“assist in the financing of development,”
especially with the current drive in super-
markets and food.
With Woolworths’ non-recourse to a
share issue to finance some of the head-
long rush into new branches, share-
holders are entitled soon to expect a
more positive lift in earning rate. This,
over the last four years, hasn’t moved
very dramatically: 1960, 14.70 p.c.; 1961
16.40 p.c.; 1962, 14.76 p.c.; 1963, 15.99
p.c.
The major retailers, of course, still
remain one of the most solid investments
available. Woolworths’ ss. shares, now
around 175., return 3.5 p.c. on a 12 p.c.
dividend paid since 1958.
And shareholders received their last
benefit as recently as August, 1962. There
couldn’t really be much to quarrel with
in a one-for-five at par. The writing
was surely on the wall for less frequent
cash issues. Costs of developmental
financing are being finely calculated.
Fire-fighters’ Perils
Fighting Equipment’s reverse
was scarcely unexpected, though its
actual size might have taken some faith-
ful shareholders by surprise. Earnings
went down from £89,225 to £26,919 in
1961-62 and now the latest year gave a
plunge into a £39,882 loss.
No dividend at all is payable after
seven years at 10 p.c. Directors had
manfully faced this situation in May,
stating that “a reduced dividend is inevit-
able and, indeed, if in May and June we
are precluded from completing contracts
now held, it would be wise to forgo
any dividend this year.”
The May report broke tradition, “real-
ising our shareholders would want to
know good or bad news as soon as
possible.” To the plaints of hectic com-
petition and reduced margins in the fire
protection industry, directors were forced
to add wharf disruption and delayed
shipping from strikes and weather affect-
the world of business
“Oh, the money's hidden safely enough, but, in ten years' time, will I
be able to convert it into decimal currency?"

The May report did convey that 1963-
64 would get off to a much better start.
Confirmation will be expected with the
full 1962-63 accounts.
Such a hitherto lively company must
be completely capable of pulling out of
the doldrums, but many investors will
still doubtless feel like waiting on the
next interim report before chancing their
arm. The ss. shares, which held at a
high Bs. earlier this year, slipped from
ss. sd. to 4s. 9d. after the preliminary
statement. There’ll be much biding of
time.
Exactly the same attitude appears
quite justified for Fire Fighting’s bigger
and more diversified rival, Wormald
Brothers Industries. Here profit slipped
a sizeable £181,923 to £209,697. Earn-
ing rate goes to 6.2 p.c. on higher capital
and directors have decided to halve the
dividend to 5 p.c.
Wormald still has to display the fruits
of a confidently expressed reorganisation
along divisional lines of a vast multitude
of subsidiaries The markets also have in
mind too hopeful predictions made at
the end of 1961-62.
These once-favored shares have
dropped to 75., against a 1963 peak at
11s. Id. and 12s. 9d. in 1962.
The State of the Union
TTnion Carbide's new sales record for
the 1962-63 year certainly produced
considerably better earnings than the
previous sales peak in 1961-62. Profit
has leapt by £140,755 to £327,983, very
nearly compensating 1961-62’s £160,244
fall.
Then, of course, there followed much
talk of competition and lower margins,
of the need for tariff protection not “as
a favour, but ... as a right which we
have earned.”
Now, the atmosphere hasn’t greatly
changed, though perhaps more efficiency
is the rule among chemical makers.
“Keen competition was encountered in
all important areas of our business, and
selling prices were subject to strong and
continuing downward pressure. This
was particularly so from imported com-
petitive products,” the managing director
(Mr N. H. Freeman) observes.
Altona's polyethylene, in greater-than-
designed production, took some knocks
from a flood of imports following a col-
lapse in world prices late in 1962.
Emergency duties reduced the volume
of competitive imports “to a workable
level.”
The 20s. shares are now yielding
around 2.8 p.c. on a retained 10 p.c. divi-
dend. Their appeal is still to long-term
investors, who are able to wait for the
distant kick of added benefits.
Mixed Results for RMC
T>re-tax profit of the world’s largest
ready-mixed concrete company and
Australia’s largest quarrymaster, Ready
Mixed Concrete Ltd, rose by £154,529,
but the net result after tax was substan-
tially the same at £1,059,309.
Depreciation was provided for in ex-
cess of rates allowed by the Tax Com-
missioner, and was £134,463 higher for
the year to June 30, at £1,381,848.
Wet weather in Australia and arctic
conditions in the UK did not prevent pro-
fits from improving on 1961-62, but
operations in Brazil and Malaya were less
profitable, according to the preliminary
statement.
RMC did not mention its tin mining
activities in Malaya in the 1962 annual
accounts or chairman’s address. These
are a relic of the Consolidated Tin

lower in 1962-63. The trouble in Brazil
was currency depreciation.
A legacy of the palmy years is the
greatly expanded capital to be serviced.

The market did not greet the profit
news with any relish for the ss. shares

More Pile on Feltex
T>ather conflicting evidence of greater
prosperity was presented by Felt
and Textiles of Australia Ltd in its pre-
liminary statement for 1962-63.
Sales rose 10 p.c. to £45 million, and
net profit rose 28 p.c. to £1,079,815, but
provisions for tax and depreciation were
lower.
The South African subsidiary made
another record profit, but NZ contri-
buted slightly less than last year’s record.
The Australian organisation, which had
earlier suffered from the recession, made
significant increases in the latest year
to June 30.
New shares born of the one-for-five par
issue in June, 1963, did not qualify for
any of the 10 p.c. dividend paid in 1962-
63, so the earning rate accelerated from
15.2 to 19.3 p.c.
While it is conceded that dividend
commitment will be greater in the current
year, the ss. shares at 9s. 3d. to yield
5.4 p.c. appear underestimated in the
current market.
Prospective buyers apparently are
waiting to be convinced by the annual
accounts and directors’ report.
ARC Enmeshed
A lthough the interim report men-
tioned a reduction in profit margins,
the final outcome of trading by ARC
Industries Ltd in the year to June was
disappointing.
The one-for-one bonus of last Novem-
ber is difficult to reconcile with a 16 p.c.
profit fall for 1962-63, even though
directors indicated then that there would
be no immediate overall increase in
dividend payments.
Sales for the first half of the year were
“substantially” higher, and net results
at a “satisfactory level.”
New earning rate is 13.5 p.c., com-
pared with dividend of 7i p.c.
The lower margins on sale of concrete
reinforcements mean that ARC has to
fight harder to stay in the same position.

Screening Tin
A rdlethan Tin’s latest progress report
sounds a trifle disingenuous on the
vexed matter of water supply from the
Murrumbidgee to the mill site. It will
be recalled that a prospectus cost esti-
mate of £BO,OOO was inflated to
£151,620 when a quotation from Nor-
thern Riverina County Council engineers
came to hand.
All that directors now find to tell
shareholders in this respect is: “Although
some difficulties have been encountered,
it is hoped that agreement will be reach-
ed in this matter within the next few
weeks.” More precision was called for.
On other concerns the report is quite
explicit. The overall construction pro-
gramme keeps to time and should be
completed in January next year. Direc-
tors are now considering tenders to mine
under contract for a two-year term
starting January, 1964.
The ss. shares become fully paid by
the call due on September 11. Pre-call
sales ranged around 4s. 2d. The company
is well backed and recent tin prices have
done nothing to diminish its prospects.
Sweet Success
Seventy years after the crash of 1893
which precipitated The Millaquin
Sugar Co. Ltd into the hands of the
Queensland National Bank until 1911,
Millaquin is able to celebrate with a one-
for-three bonus the third in the post-
war era.
A profit rise was well anticipated, as
six other sugar millers had improved
profits this year, and Millaquin satisfied
everyone with a lift from last year’s
record net of £207,598 to a heady
£343,453.
Dividend will be cut back from 20 p.c.
for 1962-63 to a minimum of 171 p.c.
after the bonus, provided seasonal and
marketing conditions are normal.
Latest earnings would be 28.6 p.c. on
the larger capital.
New plant requires £400,000 during
1963-64, but the company is so well
heeled that this should not present any
problems.
Immediately before the news, the 10s.

nounced the same day as the original bid.

A Worthy Borrower
Prestige, just as much as the present
trend of interest rates, has permitted
Australian Guarantee Corporation to
lower rates over the whole of its latest
debenture and note raisings. Very few
finance companies are now so well re-
garded.
Seeking £2 million AGC will accept
oversubscriptions up to £8 million. On
the 6-10 year debentures it can confi-
dently offer 6 p.c., a full 1 p.c. under
the previous prospectus. Notes for the
same term have gone down J p.c. to
6i p.c. Reductions go all the way
through to the short-term paper.
A 6 p.c. debenture rate was last offered
by AGC in 1955, when long-term bond
rate stood at 4\ p.c. as it does now. The
move follows recent reductions by Com-
mercial and General Acceptance whose
long-term debenture rate went down from
7 to 6i p.c.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Dividend Lift Soon for IAC?
The shares in lAC (Holdings) Ltd, a
leader in the hire purchase field,
are currently selling at around
13s. 3d. At this price and based on the
continuance of the latest dividend rate
of 7d. per share, the immediate dividend
yield is 4.4 p.c. It is interesting to note
that approximately two years ago, in
mid-1961, the shares were also priced at
this level, but since that time the com-
pany has made a l-for-3 bonus issue.
This means that holders of the shares
have seen a 33i p.c. price improvement
over a period of two years.
In view of the almost uniformly good
reports which have been submitted by
the hire purchase companies over the
last two months, it is as well to consider
the shares of lAC (Holdings) as this
company balances on December 31 and
will not report on the current year’s
operations for another six months.
It is almost certainly an over-
simplification to say that a hire purchase
company makes its profits from the dif-
ference between the rate at which it
borrows and the rate at which it lends.
Nevertheless, in basic terms, this must
be a truism. From the point of view of
the year by year profits disclosed, these
will be affected in some major degree by
the method upon which it calculates its
Income to Mature Provision, and also
by its bad debt experience and its
method of handling bad debts.
Tn the case of the income to mature
provision the company states in the
director's report that the method of
calculation is:
(1) In respect of hire purchase
transactions —by the rule of 78.
(2) In respect of mortgage and
other loan transactions where
the principal and the interest
are merged and repayable by
equal monthly instalments—by
means of an electronic com-
puter using the true rate of
interest for each transaction on
a formula approved by the com-
pany’s consulting actuary.
So far as bad debts are concerned,
the chairman stated in his address on
April 23, 1963: “The practice adopted
by your company is to W'rite off actual
losses as and when they occur and
assess and make what the directors
decide is an adequate provision against
prospective losses.” There can be little
doubt from these two statements that
both these items are treated on a proper
and conservative basis.
It is rather interesting, therefore, to
look at the figures for the last five years
of the rate of return on total assets,
and in this respect the net profit of the
group before tax, depreciation and
interest has been used as the figure for
what will be called “operating revenue”.
This can only be a fairly rough measure
because the consolidated figures are used
and include the profits made from the
insurance subsidiaries.
lAC has, for the last five years, dis-
closed the interest which it has paid.
And this gives an opportunity to
calculate the average rate on its borrow-
ings. The following schedule sets out
the two figures.
“Operating Interest %
Revenue” Average
Year to % of Average Total
December 31 Total Assets Borrowings
1958 10.6 6.1
1959 8.4 5 9
1960 8.0 6.3
1961 8.2 6.7
1962 9.3 6.9
It is interesting to notice that since
1959 the average rate of interest has
been increasing slowly, and also that
from 1960 the rate of return on average
total assets has also shown an increase.
These are the results which would have
been expected, since there can be no
doubt that borrowings would have been
more expensive from 1960 onwards par-
ticularly, although we can now expect
to see a reduction in the average rate at
least in the short term.
Looking at the position so far as
further borrowings are concerned, it
seems from the latest prospectus that,
inclusive of any sums raised under this
prospectus, the company is able to incur
further liabilities up to an additional
£l4 million. Very roughly, borrowings
of this order could be expected to add
approximately £200,000 to earnings, or
to increase earnings by a further 10 p.c.
over and above the figure for the 1962
year (which has involved an estimate
because of the change in the balancing
date of the subsidiary companies).
At this level earnings would represent
just over 20 p.c. on the present ordinary
capital and would certainly give scope
for an increase in the current dividend
rate of 111 p.c. After this situation has
been achieved, it would seem that the
company would need to raise further
capital before it could borrow any
further.
The earnings which this new capital
could be expected to earn, even when
fully geared, must be a matter of making
broad estimates, but using the figures
which have been outlined earlier, it
seems unlikely that if this capital should
be issued at par, then it could earn
much in excess of 12 p.c. This means
that although the dividend rate could
be held, the overall earning rate would
certainly be reduced quite markedly by
future issues.
The company, of course, has the
option of relieving this situation by
making issues at a premium and if the
new issues, when they become due,
could be made at a ss. premium, then
the earning rate could be maintained at
about 20 p.c.
Apart from the bonus issue made in
August, 1962, the last issue to share-
holders was made in May, 1958, and
on that occasion the ordinary shares
were issued at a premium of 2s. 6d. on
a l-for-7 basis. Shareholders who are
currently paying 13s. 3d. for a 4 p.c.
yield are evidently expecting some in-
crease in their returns in the future, but
over the last five years, the shareholders
have only seen a reduction in the divi-
dend paid to them since the bonus issue
was accompanied with a reduction in
dividend, which meant that the actual
income received by the shareholders de-
clined.
Shareholders must certainly hope for
an increase in the dividend rate in the
not too far distant future, because at this
stage it would seem that another four
years could elapse before the company
would need to make its equity issue.
Total borrowings amounted to about £47
million in 1959, and at the end of 1962
amounted to about £59 million—an in-
crease of £l2 million approximately over
the period.
It is suggested that while an investment
in lAC (Holdings) gives a considerable
amount of security, these shares are
probably fully priced at current levels.


FINANCE CORPORATION OF
AUSTRALIA LIMITED
(Incorporated in South Australia)
Chairman's Address at the Annual General
Meeting of Shareholders held on Tuesday,
27th August, 1963
MR. R. S. TURNER
On 2nd January, 1963, your
Company suffered a great loss
through the death of Mr. H. H.
Pittman who had held the office
of Chairman of Directors since
the incorporation of the Com-
pany late in 1954. His great
contribution in laying the
foundations of a well-diversi-
fied business and building a
strong organisation of ener-
getic, enthusiastic executives
and staff throughout the main-
land capital cities of Australia,
has brought results which have
given satisfaction to Share-
holders in each year of the
Company’s existence. Mr. Pitt-
man’s leadership resulted in a
fine team spirit in the Board
and in the Staff. Our sympathy
is extended to Mrs. Pittman
and relatives.
From the Directors’ Report
which accompanied the Com-
pany’s Accounts and the Con-
solidated Statement for the
F'.C.A. Group of Companies for
the year ended 30th June, 1963,
Shareholders are already aware
of the satisfactory results
achieved. The consolidated net
profit, after tax provision,
was £380,522. This represented
an earning rate of 19.2% on
the average capital paid-up
throughout the year. Com-
parison with the results of the
previous year, when the profit
after tax provision was £316,861,
and the earning rate on aver-
age capital was 18.3%, is prob-
ably a fair indication of the
progress achieved in the year
under review.
Records have again been
established not only in the
profit earned but in the level
of outstandings, in total funds
employed, and in Shareholders’
Funds. Net Outstandings, i.e.,
amounts due by customers,
after deducting unearned in-
come, stood at £24,029,193 at
30th June, 1963. This figure is
36.3% higher than the com-
parable figure a year earlier,
and more than treble that of
four years ago.
The proper calculation of un-
earned income at the close of
each year on contracts in
which charges and interest are
brought to account at the time
of writing such contracts, is a
matter which has received
much public attention during
the past two or three years.
Your Company played a promi-
nent part in the woi’k under-
taken to solve this serious
problem. It is fitting that I
should pay a tribute to the out-
standing contribution of Mr.
K. C. Collins, our Local Direc-
tor in Victoi’ia, as a member of
the Committee whose recom-
mendations incorporating the
use of the “Collins Factors”
were ultimately approved by
the Australian Hire Purchase
and Finance Conference and
The Institute of Chartered Ac-
countants in Australia.
A pleasing feature of the
progress of the Company in the
past year is that the outstand-
ings in every State office
showed increases.
Our losses from bad debts
have proven a very minor
item since the inception of the
Company. In fact, over the
whole period, the average
annual loss from bad debts
would represent only a small
fraction of one per cent of the
average outstandings at the
end of each year. Nevertheless,
your Directors have considered
it prudent year by year to build
up a Contingency and Doubtful
Debts Reserve, although any
debts actually considered bad
or doubtful have been written
off each year before arriving at
the net profit. The Reserve
stood at £300,000 as at 30th
June, 1963. The relevant in-
come tax has been paid, or pro-
vided, in respect of this Re-
serve. In the latest Consoli-
dated Balance Sheet, the Re-
serve is shown as a deduction
from Oustandings amounting
to £24,029,193, under the head-
ing “Current Assets”.
Reserves, exclusive of that
for Contingencies and Doubt-
ful Debts, appear in the Con-
solidated Balance Sheet at
£998,231 and support the Paid-
Up Capital of £2,254,300. During
the year, £160,946 was trans-
ferred from the Appropriation
Account of the Parent Com-
pany to General Reserve.
So that the Company will
always be in a position to meet
its liabilities for amounts bor-
rowed whenever they are re-
payable, a policy "of high
liquidity is followed. The Con-
solidated Balance Sheet in-
dicates that the Group held
on deposit and in the bank
£2,029,537. More than £500,000
additional funds have been
profitably invested in Com-
panies whose shares are quoted
on the Official List of a Stock
Exchange. These sums, together
with monthly receipts exceed-
ing £1,000,000 from borrowers,
ensure that the Company will
be able to repay its borrowings,
of which £8,729,801 owing at
30th June, 1963, will fall due in
the current year.
In its Debenture Issues the
Company continues to enjoy
strong support from the invest-
ing public and financial in-
stitutions. In the year under
review, two such issues were
heavily oversubscribed. The
last issue of £1,000,000 was
quickly filled, and the Board’s
decision not to accept more
than £2,500,000, including over-
subscriptions, necessitated our
closing the issue after seven
weeks, except for applications
made by holders of maturing-
debentures to convert them to
the current issue.
A pleasing feature of recent
Debenture Issues has been the
degree of support from States
other than South Australia.
This, no doubt, results from
the Company having become
nation-wide in its operations.
Whereas six years ago, almost
the whole of the Company’s
outstandings were in respect of
South Australian business, to-
day approximately 75% relates
to contracts in other states.
The Company’s Ordinary
Stock and Shares are quoted
on the Official Lists of the
Stock Exchanges of all the
mainland capital cities, and
Share Registers are maintained
in those cities. At 30th June,
1963, there were 1,350 Stock-
holders and Shareholders, and
8,787 Debenture Stockholders
and Depositors.
In all, the Company has
made five issues of Ordinary
Shares from 1955 to 1963.
Each issue was for one million
shares of 10/- each, and was
at par. The latest issue was in
May, 1963, when 5/- per share
was payable. The balance of 5/-
per share will be called up
and become payable by 30th
November, 1963.
There is no doubt that the
finance industry is making a
major contribution to National
development particularly the
member companies of Aus-
tralian Hire Purchase and
Finance Conference —of which
your Company was a founda-
tion member.
Business available in the
period under review was keenly
competitive, and continues to
be so. There is no evidence of
an overall shortage of funds,
although finance companies in
which one of the trading
banks is a substantial share-
holder seem likely to be more
successful than othei’s in fund-
raising. The Bank of Adelaide,
which has, since the inception
of your Company, held 40% of
the Issued Ordinary Capital
continues to be of great assist-
ance to the Company.
To the degree to which
diversification of its business
appeax-s likely to be practicable
and profitable, your Company
will follow this course. The
subsidiary company, F. C. A.
Leasing Limited, which is
closely following the American,
pattern of leasing, has made
steady progress in all States.
Australian industry is now be-
coming more conscious that
leasing frees working capital
for more profitable use within
their organisations, realising
that profits are earned by the
use, rather than by ownership,
of plant. During the year, a
wide variety of industries have
undertaken leases with the
Company in respect of plant
and machinery and motor
vehicle fleet requirements.
By sending key executives
abroad, the Company will con-
tinue to study overseas prac-
tices, and will seek to imple-
ment those which seem likely
to be of benefit to commerce
and industry in Australia, or to
enable the Company to operate
more efficiently.
The volume of business being
transacted in this new financial
year justifies the confidence of
your Directors that a satisfac-
tory profit will again be earned.
The final dividend out of
profits of the year ended 30th
June, 1963, which is recom-
mended by your Directors is
again 5%, making a total divi-
dend for the year of 10%. This
is consistent with the rate paid
since the first year of your
Company.
You will be asked to re-elect
the retiring Directors, Sir Bar-
ton Pope, one of the original
Directors of the Company, and
Mr. C. J. Glover, who was
appointed by the Board early
this year to fill the vacancy
caused by the death of Mr.
H. H. Pittman.
I shall conclude with a re-
ference to our Executive and
Staff, who number almost 209
throughout the mainland capi-
tal cities. It would, I think, be
difficult to find a more en-
thusiastic, competent group
than those led by your General
Manager, Mr. A. C. Noble, and
Assistant General Manager,
Mr. K. W. Adcock. The team
spirit, which permeates our
whole organisation has assisted
substantially in the achieve-
ment of the growth of your
Company, and the results re-
flected in the 1962-63 Accounts.
I am confident that I speak not
only for my Co-Directors but
for every Member of the Com-
pany in expressing our thanks
to the Staff.
R. S. TURNER
Chairman of Directors.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Why Pye Hit the Sky
Troubling of profit—which took the
market so much by surprise —is
credited by the chairman of Pye In-
dustries Ltd to the installation of extra
machinery and introduction of new
models and products.
Profit of £328,449 was actually a re-
bound from last year’s fall to £163,728.
Although the £239,333 written off for
bad debts and the reference to an
additional substantial sum provided for
doubtful debts made some observers
shudder, the net result after these
gigantic provisions was very good in-
deed, and met with general market
approval.
To wit, the 20s. shares, which have
not been above 58s. in the last five
years, and were 51s. prior to the profit
announcement, have rocketed as high as
84s. 9d.
Trading was so spirited that it seemed
Pye might do a Ducon. But the absence
of any unusual announcement has not
brought a price relapse, and belated
recognition of intrinsic merit now
appears to be the reason for the strong
support.
Earning rate was propelled from 21.2
to 43.0 p.c., but directors were not
tempted to increase dividend above the
usual 10 p.c. rate, as they are fully
cognisant of the competitiveness of the
industry and how susceptible it is to
periodical troubles, both on the retail
and manufacturing sides.
Directors said the improved results
reflected increased turnover, higher
operating efficiencies, and successful
diversification.
The major part of the parent com-
pany’s turnover is in TV receivers, but
new products are being added to the
appliance range. The Colston dish-
washer has steady growth potential.
More than half the bad debts written
off were in respect of amounts owed by
Inglis Electrix Pty (since placed in
liquidation), and the balance includes
sums owed by the Reid Murray group.
Bendix - Tecnico (Automotive) Pty
supplies 60 p.c. of carburettors and 75
p.c. of air filters used for original equip-
ment of Australian vehicles. It also
makes small engine carburettors for
lawnmowers and stationary engines. The
i booming automotive industry brought
good business to this subsidiary
during 1962-63, and the company is
proud to have negotiated successfully
with Volkswagen for the supply of
engine carburettors and fuel pumps for
VW’s entire Australian production.
Bendix-Tecnico Pty serves the aviation
industry and defence forces. The factory
was not fully occupied as orders for
aircraft components slackened, but new
defence commitments promise greatly
improved results for 1963-64.
Samson Arcwell Electrical Pty, maker
of resistance welding equipment, was
taken over during the year.
F. W. Davey consolidated and ad-
vanced into new designs for multi-stage
pumps, alternators, variable speed drives
and welding generators.
Tecnico Electronics Pty increased pro-
duction of printed circuit boards.
Colville Wireless and Electric Co. Pty
completed its first major contract in the
very specialised field of induction and
die-electric heating.
Substantial investment was made
during the year in property and plant,
and this has allowed the group to cope
with demand for existing products and
those yet in the planning stage.
Pye, formerly Tecnico Ltd, is associ-
ated with Pye of England which owns
half the ordinary capital (hence a certain
shortage of scrip). It obtains technical
assistance from the English company,
and has sales, service and manufacturing
agreements with other British and
French and American organisations.
The company’s endeavors to diversify
in the electrical and electronics field are
meeting with obvious success, and the
shares fully deserve their higher rating.
At 84s. 9d. the 20s. shares show a
modest dividend yield of 2.4 p.c., but
the 10.2 p.c. earnings yield promises good
things to come.
GEELONG GAS CO. LTD
Progressive Local Service
The recent bid for Gas Supply Co. Ltd
A by Boral has cast rather more light
on the gasmakers. Although it would be
foolish to assume that The Geelong Gas
Co. Ltd would be of similar takeover
interest, the fact that it was the first in
Australia to depart from traditional
methods of gas manufacture makes it
deserving of attention for its own sake.
The rising price of coal, past un-
certainties of supply, a sharp decline in
the coke market, and heavy capital
charges for coal carbonising plant led
The Geelong Gas Co. in mid-1961 to
arrange with Shell Refinery (Aust.) Pty
for the supply of refinery gases of high
purity from which gas was produced in
a catalytic reforming plant. The Shell
agreement runs until 1975.
The dependability and operating and
maintenance costs of this plant have
exceeded expectations. Coal carbonising
plant was used in the year to June 30,
1963, only to satisfy the demand for
coke, and to use the stock carried for-
ward from 1962.
Improved economic conditions charac-
terised trading in 1962-63. Sales of
major gas appliances to residential
customers increased 14.6 p.c. Sales of
gas to commercial consumers rose 15.6
p.c., to industrial consumers 31.6 p.c.,
and to domestic consumers 5.7 p.c.
Sales of heatane gas, distributed
within a radius of 25 miles of Geelong
for the Gas and Fuel Corporation rose
by 40 p.c.
The distribution system now covers
250 miles of mains, of which 30 p.c.
has been put down in the past five years,
and 46 p.c. in the last ten years. (Some
of this was replacement of existing
mains.)

at £57,000, and £20,162 more for de-
preciation at £78,965 (to keep abreast
of technological changes), net profit rose
from £79,338 to £83,704 in the year
under review.
The company spent £174,077 for plant
additions and improvements, and is com-
mitted to capital expenditure of £42,815.
The chairman said in his review that this
will be mainly for laying of mains and
services to improve present supply and
extend into new areas.
No expansion of works plant is en-
visaged other than the commissioning of
the gas holder of one million cubic feet
capacity now being erected by Power-
Gas Corporation (Australasia) Pty.
The company’s primary problem is
marketing. The chairman said the selling
of heat service is a highly competitive
business, but Geelong Gas was challeng-
ing its competitors “spiritedly, cleanly
and factually.”
Par issues have been made in 1954,
1956 and 1960, and other capital has
been obtained by debenture loan from an
assurance company.
The 20s. shares sold recently at 335. 6d.
to return 4.8 p.c. They are usually rated
a few shillings below Gas Supply 20s.
shares which also collect an 8 p.c. divi-
dend.
But Gas Supply, servicing provincial
and country towns in Victoria, NSW
and Queensland, had the greater invest-
ment potential, as the Boral offer de-
monstrated. The Geelong company serves
only that city, population of which is
around 92,000.
DENNYS, LASCELLES LTD
Wool Firm’s High Liquidity
T>rofit recovery for Dennys, Lascelles
A Ltd, Geelong-based woolbroker and
stock and station agent, reflected the
higher prices realised for the 1962-63
wool cheque, since the number of bales
sold by the company during the season
actually fell by just on 4 p.c.
The company is still one of the small-
est woolbroking firms in Australia, hand-
ling about 23 p.c. of the clip.
Despite mergers by the larger com-
petitors to eliminate overlapping of costs,
directors claim that the company is
trading in a restricted area and they can
see few advantages for shareholders in
a merger.
The original company was established
in Geelong in 1857, and the present
company came into being in 1912. It
now has branches in 42 Victorian centres
as well as in Melbourne, and operates
through another 26 agencies.
Expansion has been achieved since the
war by the acquisition of a number of
country stock and station agents.
Issues to shareholders have been
fairly generous during recent years, in-
cluding a 3-for-10 at 10s. premium in
1951 and 2-for-5 issues at par in 1955
and again in 1961. These have lifted
paid-up capital to £764,400, all in 20s.
ordinaries.
Located in the richest and most reli-
able sheep country in Australia, the com-
pany has not had a loss since 1931. The
centenary year 1957 saw a record profit
of £164,733.
Earnings for the latest year to June
30 rose from £lll,BBl to £139,008,
equal to 18.2 p.c. on capital. Dividend
was raised from 123 p.c. to 14 p.c.
Liquidity remains high and the next
cash issue will probably be some way
off. The latest accounts show that the
£200,000 proceeds from the 1961 issue
are still on short term deposit, giving
adequate coverage for any sudden call
on the company by pastoralists.
The current wool selling season has
opened with prices considerably above
those ruling a year ago. This continued

PORT JACKSON STEAM
Not for Widows
Tnvestment-wise, The Port Jackson
A and Manly Steamship Co. Ltd may
be of limited interest (paid capital is
£300,000 and the 10s. shares labor
around 6s. 6d.), but the company’s acti-
vities frequently set off a hue and cry
from ferry-going Sydney-siders.
Three losses in the last 12 years and
indifferent profits for the remainder have
created a chronic position of illiquidity.
Profit rose in the year to June from
£7594 to £18,797 after providing
£9175 (last year £1320) for tax. On
the other hand, there was a capital loss
of £17,642 on sale of SS Curl Curl,
which reduced general reserve to
£131,851.
Dividend was raised from 4 to 5 p.c.
taking £15,000 this latest year. Deprecia-
tion was £3502 higher at £31,311.
The number of cash fare passengers
and cruise passengers was higher in
1962-63 than in the prior year. The sub-
sidiary, Palm Beach Marine Service Pty,
which services boat owners, increased
profit.
During the latest year the company ap-
proached the NSW Government to take
over its fleet of Manly ferries and operate
them similarly to the Sydney Harbor
Ferries.
Directors have advised shareholders in
1962-63's annual report that the Govern-
ment is not interested in buying the
fleet, but will assist by allowing the
repair and maintenance of the Manly
ferries at the Sydney Harbor Transport
Board’s Balmain works.

The company can now release valu-
able foreshore property at Neutral Bay,
previously reserved for fleet maintenance.
Negotiations for the sale are under way.
Those keen on preserving the harbor
foreshores feel the property should be
reserved for public parkland. The direc-
tors’ duty to shareholders, however, is to
get the maximum possible price, and they
are believed to be asking £130,000 for
the acre site. The VG valuation is
£82,000. (Freehold and leasehold pro-
perty, plant, machinery, fittings, furni-
ture and equipment together are valued
in the company’s books at £83,078, de-
preciated cost.)
Viewing the business from the outside,
it would seem that greater efficiency and
imagination could be displayed. If the
company, under existing or new manage-
ment, were prepared to find more capi-
tal for the investigation and adoption of
hydrofoil craft, and provision of park-
ing for motorists, it could once more
play a dynamic role in Sydney trans-
port.
Certain interests have been thinking
along these lines, and have taken a very
close look at the company from outside.
For backers prepared to accept long
odds, this is an interesting spec, but
widows and orphans should leave well
alone.
ONE TO BUY
Shine on a Shoemaker
"CWery now and then a particular in-
dustry manages to attract fresh in-
vestment attention, perhaps because of
overall economic progress, expedient re-
groupings among companies or the suc-
cesses of individual firms.
All these three elements are just now
operative throughout the Australian shoe
industry. The share markets should bear
increasing witness to the fact.
So quick reaction must become a cor-
rect response to the immediate situation
before share prices of existing listed
enterprises get too keen.
A fair measure of present interest
obviously springs from the striking ad-
vance shown by International Footwear,
with a dramatically increased profit and
an initial 12ip.c. dividend for 1962-63.
Demanding equal enthusiasm from
wise investors is Clarks Shoes Australia
Ltd, whose ss. ordinary shares are traded
in Melbourne and Adelaide.
Prices have gone to around 11s. sd. at
which level they give a dividend yield at
4.4 p.c. A 10 p.c. rate followed listing in
June, 1962, though when placing shares
to the public directors had only suggested
“dividends of at least 9 p.c. a year.”
Continuous earnings growth should be
possible during the next few years.
Directors seem well intent on fortifying
reserves and consolidating recent absorp-
tions. But a fairly quick dividend lift need
not surprise.
A fruitful jump in earning rate seems
widely expected for the current year
ending on October 31. Last year's 15 5
p.c. came on profits totalling £77,311.
Much has happened further to enliven
the company since then.
March this year saw the merger of
Clarks with the General Shoe Co. of
Australia Pty Ltd, the actual operation
being completed by May. The move
made the group Australia’s largest single
shoe manufacturer and provided it with
a particularly well-integrated range.
Indeed, the accession of General
doubled effective turnover, bringing it to
some £5 million and giving the group
about 10 p.c. of the total market if rub-
ber and canvas shoes are excluded.
Nationally known brands made and mar-
keted are “Clarks”, “Harrison” and “Es-
trellita”, while General brought along
“Footrest”, “Saxone” and, in New Zea-
land, “Dearsly’s”.
Notably efficient factories operate in
Adelaide, Melbourne and New Zealand,
embracing all the main product lines ex-
cept men’s low priced shoes and women’s
high quality for the younger age bracket.
Clarks, despite a long local history, is
not now entirely Australian-owned.
C. & J. Clark Ltd, England’s biggest
single footwear manufacturer, began to
take an interest as early as 1948. The
holding has grown to, and will be held
at, 51.4 p.c. of Clark’s total capital. It
stands now at £471,456 of the present
£920,918 capital, in the form of
1,885,825 “A” shares
No profit figures are yet available for
the General Shoe acquisition, but it also
has been noted for a remarkable sales
growth over the last few years. When
accounts are combined for publication
next January, a considerable strengthen-
ing of the whole group must be visible.
As the group was composed at Octo-
ber 31 last, then capital of £500,000 was
already supported by £120,395 of re-
serves. Overdraft and long-term liabilities
were quite moderate.
But by far the best guide to the near
future is furnished by the vigorous state
of the shoe industry, growing at a speed-
ier rate than mere population increase
and evidencing a higher average demand
for better quality footwear.
Increasing productivity can also
signify greater all-round profitability.
Further mergers in the industry could
well be on the cards and even some
moves into direct retailing.
On all counts the industry and
Clarks will repay attention.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
A Speculative Mining Stock
llUith the market rising to higher levels,
"" it’s getting increasingly difficult to
pick a stock in which one can be certain
of getting a price rise. Some brokers are
even suggesting the possibility of a slight
downward, though temporary, adjust-
ment to the whole market One thing for
certain, the market hasn’t reached the
frenzied levels of the 1960 boom period.
So 1 thought I would turn my atten-
tion this week to the mining field. Like
the industrial section, mining stocks are
all at very high levels. In fact, 1 think
that if an investor had taken a spread
over the whole mining industry (lead,
zinc, rutile, tin) two years ago he would
now be doing far better than the average
industrial investor.
The particular stock I had in mind
was Pacific Island Mines. The com-
pany’s shares have risen strongly in the
last month from static levels ot about
2s. to 3s. 9d. The company controls
leases at Misima Island off the east coast
of New Guinea. Results to hand are
very encouraging and the company is
endeavoring to tie up with an overseas
group to finance further exploration and
development. From the optimistic re-
ports of the investigating geologist
(who I believe is very reputable) a tie-
up should not be difficult.
Assays from recent sampling should
be released in the near future and they
are expected to be good. The capital of
the company is small (less than
£100,000) and well worthy of a very
speculative interest. I bought 2000
options at an average price of Is. lid.
To pay for the week’s purchases and
also to reduce that large debit in the
account, I decided to take (at last!) a
profit on some of the holding in Hani-
mex. The company’s shares rose strongly
in response to an announcement regard-
ing tariff protection for certain camera
equipment. I am expecting an earning
rate of over 30 p.c. this year from this
company but, just in case, I sold 500
at an average price of 12s. 3d., giving
me a nice profit of £125.
I thought I might sell my holding in
Ducon at this stage, now that it is un-
likely that Plessey scrip will be listed
on Australian exchanges. However, I
will try to hang on another week to see
if I get at least what I paid for them.
The week’s operations were:
SOLD
500 Hanimex, 12/3 £3OO
BOUGHT
2000 Pacific Island Mines
options, 1/11 £200
This has reduced the debit in ray
account to £220.
The portfolio now is:


THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Splitting (Potato) Chips
rPRUCKS running blockades at night,
clashes between growers, and a
market that dazed the housewife with
its leaps and plunges were among mem-
ories of civil war in the potato industry
that were revived in Victoria last week
by proposals to form another marketing
board.
Boards have toppled before and some
have remained moribund for years, but
if these proposals materialise it will be
the first time the failure of a marketing
board has been followed by its re-
establishment.
Between the death of the old board
and the birth of plans for a new one
lies the corpse of another attempt by
the industry to organise itself a grow-
ers’ co-operative that at first looked like
being the industry’s salvation but which
a few weeks ago was abandoned for
much the same reasons as brought about
the demise of the board.
Much as this latest bid for stability
might seem haunted by the ghosts of
previous ones, leaders of the industry
are confident of success. Three main
factors account for their optimism: The
price control that hamstrung the previous
board is no longer with us, scope for
interstate trading is much smaller than
before and amendments to the Market-
ing Act offer greater flexibility in such
things as paying a premium for quality.
HEhe life of the first board extended from
1947 to 1957, but its decline orig-
inated before that. During the war the
National Potato Committee was set up
under emergency regulations to ensure
enough potatoes for domestic and mili-
tary use. All were grown on contract
to the Federal Government at fixed
prices, and growers liked the set-up.
Acreages were controlled, and although
farmers did not make fortunes they had
the comfortable feeling of being able
to look ahead and know what they were
going to get for their efforts.
When the system was abandoned after
the war, growers took immediate steps
to have a potato marketing board estab-
lished. Some feared this enthusiasm was
misplaced, and when the result of the
vote was overwhelmingly affirmative they
saw it as a mandate not for a board
of which the voters had had no experi-
ence but for a return to the wartime
system.
Contrary to what many growers had
imagined, the board had no power to
control acreages. Even worse was the
discovery that prices were controlled
by the Victorian Prices Commissioner,
who many see today as the real cause
of the board’s failure. Nor, unlike the
wartime set-up, was there any control
over the interstate movement of potatoes.
Dy early 1954, the board was being
supported by only 40 p.c. of produc-
ers and announced that it could not carry
on. Whereas interstate trading under the
shield of Section 92 of the Constitution
had at first been used to circumvent the
board, towards the end of its life grow-
ers were openly flouting it within the
State.
No amount of skill by the board could
have prevailed against the ability of
blackmarketeers to tempt growers with
premiums. In addition to being free of
the administrative costs of running a
board designed to reduce market fluctu-
ations, the outsiders could offer a cash
price in place of the “first advance” the
board was obliged to make in order
to hold part of the proceeds for a final
adjustment when the season was com-
plete. Growers were often getting £lB
from dealers when the best the board
could do in its first advance was £l6
and the producer whose loyalty could
survive a margin of even 10s. a ton
was rare.
The board reached the end of its use-
fulness and the industry its nadir
in 1954, when a combination of over-
production and disorganisation sent
prices down to £5 a ton. It was in this
year, when they most needed it, that
the growers finally let their board die.
Two years later, as though to give all
sides a taste of its new freedom, the
market struck out at the housewife with
prices of £lOO a ton and more. They did
not last, as many growers had hoped,
for the Olympic Games later in the year,
but slumped by then to £3O a ton.
One of the old board members, Mr
George Pearce, who was growing pota-
toes near Daylesford, understood the
difficulties the board had faced. Ele be-
lieved that if growers formed a co-op-
erative marketing society there would
be greater flexibility and more incentive
for members to stick together and make
a go of it.
At first there was much enthusiasm
for the new co-operative, which was
soon handling about 80 p.c. of the State’s
crop better than the average percent-
age achieved by the board. But soon the
rot set in. There was the old bogey of
cash-on-the-knocker from the specula-
tors, and the co-operative became em-
broiled in legal action over the validity
of its form of contract.
it lost the case in the Supreme
T Court, the co-operative lost most of
its friends. Efforts were made to write up
members again under newly-worded
contracts but not enough support could
be rallied to carry on, and the organisa-
tion slid downhill in much the same way
as the board before it.
After ceasing operations as a trading
body, it kept alive for a while by manu-
facturing potato chips, but recently this,
too, was stopped, and the co-operative,
although being preserved in structure, is
now defunct.
Various groups in Victoria’s potato
industry, including two growers’ organi-
sations and the remnants of the co-
operative's board of directors, recently
got together and formed the Potato
Growers’ Council, a co-ordinating body.
Their first objective is to have a board
re-established.
A board this time, they believe, will
succeed because it cannot be frustrated
by price control, and interstate trading
will be much less than before although
some observers think the blackmarket
boys are only waiting for such a chance
to hop back into business. Members of
the council also attach hope to minor
amendments to the Marketing Act which
have the effect of enabling quality to
be taken into account in producers’ pay-
ments instead of, as before, all receiving
a rigid standard return in any given
marketing period.
The best tipsters of potato industry
affairs think that if a poll on the estab-
lishment of a board were held tomorrow
it would romp home. For months, potato
prices in Melbourne have sunk to £lO or
£l2 a ton the worst since the depres-
sion of 1954. Producers say they are
going broke and cannot buy shoes for
their children.
Last year, Victoria’s 3558 producers
grew 196,000 tons of potatoes on
36,469 acres. This year the acreage is
about 43,000 an increase of 18 p.c.
Against the prospect of an even fur-
ther worsening of the industry’s plight,
a board, despite the precedents, cannot
look too bad.

. . . you're AUTOMATICALLY on your way!
It s the Wolseley tradition to be way out in front with quality, performance
and engineering. Look at Wolseley's luxury, then examine other cars in the
same price range. Listen to the purr of the 'Blue Streak Six'. Feel the power
at the press of a pedal and the roadholding that makes driving a
pleasure. And now compare the Automatic transmission that's "automatically
better. The three speed hydraulic torque convertor; the light, compact,
space saving unit; the manual overide that allows engine braking and
emergency push starting. No other car matches Wolseley value for money.
Buy wisely buy Wolseley.
