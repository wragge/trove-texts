This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS. AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to h'u
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. 11 is practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.
YOUNG MEN

gressions or excesses of more nature age, bladder
difficulties, a whitish or dark ropy sediment in

Showing plainly how all diseases of the private or
nervous system may be cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnecessary expence. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
tion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by lire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All
communications should be addressed

“A Vote for Thrift.”
A correspondent of the Sydney Daily
Telegraph, subscribing himself Colin M.
Smith, writes in a spirit of weird exaltation
regarding the voting deservingness of an
alleged virtue yclept “ Thrift.” " His letter
is, on the whole, praiseworthily temperate,
and his English is a peg or so Higher in
calibre than the average importer s mer-
cantile epistolary jargon ; but his logic is
pitifully erratic, and his arguments would be
considered eccentric and wildly original even
in the fabled land of paradox that Dean
Swift lias immortalised under the designa-
tion of Laputa. In the first place, he con-
founds a moral quality (if it is a moral
quality), with a principle of political economy
springing from an arbitrarily-adopted sys-
tem ; and, in the second place, he demands
a reward for his specified virtue out of all
proportion to its assumed value, and to the
exclusion of all other moral qualities what-
soever.
# * #
Thrift is not Capital. So manifestly is
this the case that the cultivation of “ thrift ”
is usually in exactly inverse ratio to the
amount of capital possessed by the culti-
vator. The father of nine girls—not one of
whom he can marry off his hands—who is in
receipt of a salary which meets about two-
thirds of the just and Necessary require-
ments of his family, is ordinarily the man
we expect to hud manufacturing a virtue out
of necessity—in which case necessity takes
the guise of virtue and calls itself “Thrift.”
To argue the possession of as much “ Thrift ”
by an individual as pounds sterling, or bank-
shares, or mining-scrip or debentures, or
stock of any character whatsoever that he
may likewise possess, is ridiculous. Capital
is always the same fluctuating, non-moral,
non-omotional, non-intellectual integer, no
matter who possesses it ; and one might as
well attempt to assess the mental faculties of a
horse by the number of nails in his shoes as
the moral qualities of a man (Thrift in-
cluded) by the number of guineas he
possesses. Take an example ; One thousand
navvies are necessary to perform a certain
amount of work, and a capital of ten
thousand pounds is necessary to put this
labour into motion. Now this sum may be
the savings of ten-thousand widows (who,
being women, would have no vote at all), or
it may be a paltry speculatory driblet from
the coffers of a Gould. In all human pro-
bability where should we look for the
“Thrift” here? —in the case of the
millionaire, or in the case of the widows ?
* * *
“Thrift” is a moral quality. Capital is
not a moral quality ; and things unlike can-
not be compared. Nay, more, the terms
Capital and Labour, used in a comparative
sense, are likewise absurd. Labour is a term
representing human endeavour and neces-
sarily human interest. The thing called
Capital—(no matter how it is owned or
directed) —is only the tool by which Labour
—(no matter whose) —is enabled to operate.
The one thousand navvies represent a bundle
of human aims and aspirations which cannot
morally be abridged or curtailed by the
ten thousand pounds necessary to put their
labour into motion. The ten thousand pounds
may be owned by ten thousand widows ; or
five thousand, or five hundred, or twenty, or
ten shareholders—or one ; it carries with it
no corresponding weight of human interest.
It is mere operating-power, always fluctuat-
ing in value, always changing hands, and
never stopping in one pair of hands long
enough for one to count it.

Colin M. Smith simply claims a vote for
Capital, which ho calls by the name of
“Thrift”—although it is manifestly ridi-
culous to regard the accumulators of Capital
as the most thrifty amongst men, or to regard
“ Thrift ” itself as a virtue so exalted as to
demand a reward above all other virtues—
and, to be strictly logical, he would doubt-
less be agreeable to measure out voting power
according to the amount of capital {i e.,
“ Thrift ') possessed at the time the electoral
rolls were made up. In other words, a fall
in the price of stocks would so depreciate
the value of Brown’s property—(that is, his
moral quality, called “Thrift”) —that he
would be disfranchised until a lucky specu-
lation enabled him once more to pose as a
virtuous man and a duly qualified elector.
* # *
Mr. Smith is so fully convinced of the
righteousness of politically - empowered
wealth, that he makes the following mani-
festly incorrect and misleading statement :
Under some rule of “ one shareholder one vote ” most of
the splendid achievements of our time would have been
impossible.
Now this sounds plausible ; but it is not true.
Many of these achievements we are accus-
tomed to designate as “ splendid ” are wind-
blown frauds, fraught with subsequent
disaster to millions ; many of these achieve-
ments have been national undertakings con-
spicuously adopted by those countries the
most democratic in their mode of Govern-
ment—no one hears of “splendid achieve-
ments ” being realised in such countries as
Russia, for instance. Of course, we exclude
from the category of “splendid achieve-
ments ” all wars, whether undertaken for
the “advancement of commerce” or other-
wise ; and one can readily appreciate the
eagerness of a capitalistic and commercial
voting-power to dominate and direct the
fighting force of a nation —the recollection of
England’s last disgraceful Egyptian war is
yet fresh in our minds.
# * *
This, however, is, a digression. To
return to the subject: many of the
most conspicuously “splendid achieve-
ments ” of our age have originated in the
brains of poor men who, not having capital
to develope their ideas, have been com-
pelled to sell their interests to a robber
band of speculators, and the exceptional and
non-original means thus put in the hands of
these gentlemen enabled them to amass
wealth, morality, and voting power at the
same instant, thus effectually gaining a
monopoly of all the virtue extant on the
earth. In some few cases “splendid achieve-
ments ” have been perfected to their full
fruitage by men possessing little monetary
or political power, by the intensity of their
convictions, by the reasonableness and the
desirability of their ideals, and by the
magnetism of their personality. We do say,
however, and say it witli a strong sense of
certitude, that not in this, or in any other
age whatsoever since man has achieved con-
sciousness, has the possession of mere
operating power (call it Capital, or “Thrift,”
or exploitation, or any other name within
the two covers, of a dictionary) advanced by
one single fraction of an iota anything within
the memory of man that he has the audacity
to call “ splendid,” or the courage to desig-
nate by the ambitious title of an “achieve-
ment.”
* # #
But, apart from this question as to the
identity of “Thrift” with the possession of
Capital, there arises one other question—
namely, is “Thrift,” taking it in its ordi-
dinary acceptation, so superlative a virtue ?
What is it, mainly 1 The ability to take
care of number-one ; and number-one, having
taken care of himself up to a certain stage,
calmly turns round and demands from
number-two, &c., certain privileges which
shall make it impossible for anybody else
to take care of himself for all eternity.
“Thrift,” once said Blake, the poet, “is a
disgusting and penurious old prude courted
by Incapacity. ’ Of course, Mr. Smith does
not mean that sort of “ Thrift.” The virtue
he has in his eye is not the careful stretch-
ing of a yard of elastic across a three-chain
road without snapping it. Mr. Smith’s
thrifty man is the clever financier who can
angle for millions with a bait constructed
out of an adroit prospectus and the masterful
manipulation of probabilities. Wherever
“Thrift” per se made a rich man out of a
poor one, the hand of God was in evidence
and a miracle was being worked. The
“Thrift ’ most people know of is going
without that which you ought to have but
which you cannot get, and nobody is thrifty
in this sense when circumstances favour the
getting of it, unless he be a fool or a rogue,
or be else so low in the social scale as to
deserve the name neither of fool or rogue.
The man useful to humanity does not pare
cheese and bait his rat-trap on the smell of
the rind which he has eaten himself. No
man lives who has made a fortune by
“Thrift,” and if he did live, the mere fact
of his existence brands him so effectually as
a creature not fit to exist, from his enmity to
his kind, that while capital punishment is
permitted to exist in any shape he should
be immediately taken forth and hanged
from the nearest lamp-post,
* * #
We do not, therefore, regard “Thrift”
as one virtue among ten thousand. If
we did so regard it, we could hardly
consent to reward it virtue is, perhaps
unfortunately, its own reward ; at all
events, we never heard of any of the
moral qualities attaining the dignity of par-
liamentary representation, although most
legislative associations have the reputation
of being the home and family cradle of
nearly all the vices in the calendar. The
ability to take care of oneself may be a very
“ splendid achievement,” but it is usually so
deeply implanted in most men that it needs
very little artificial encouragement: especi-
ally as, at present, those who cannot, or will
not, take care of themselves are promptly
sent to the lunatic asylum. If we arc to
reward the man who makes his own position
secure, what are we to do for the man whose
concern in life is the welfare of others 1 If
“Thrift” is to be rewarded, what of Benevol-
ence ? The ancient Greeks had other ideas
than we in regard to this matter. To be
rich while in office was so much of a crime
that men were frequently arraigned and
expatriated on no more serious ground.
A r Ist ms gave away all his property when
appointed to a position in the public service,
lest he should be accused of what Mr.
Smith calls “Thrift.” Lest Parkes, upon
reading this, should immediately pose as a
modern Aristides, we hasten to inform him
that the ancient political Greek was a firm
believer in the ideal of Fenelon, that a man
who served the State should die leaving
neither property nor debts. Pauperism in
a politician was in ancient Greece a virtue,
for the Greeks argued—and rightly—that a
man could not possibly serve equally
honestly both himself and the State. Again,
if we reward any one moral quality at all,
why should we not reward the whole of the
moral qualities ?
* # #
We are playing with words ! It comes
simply to this, Mr. Colin M. Smith does
not demand a vote for “ Thrift.” In reality,
he asks a vote for Capital as opposed to
Human Interests of all and every kind. He
says, in eftect, “strengthen the position of
those who already have in such a manner as
to render them impregnable, and to put
beyond the pale of possibility the employ-
ment of the same means by which they
attained that position by others who may
desire to do likewise.” In the commercial
world first is ever victor. The political
entrenchment of Capital would mean the
permanent disabling of would-be Capital,
“ Thrift’’-promoted or otherwise. But,
and here comes into consideration a fric-
tional interest--a vote for “Thrift,”
that is ability to operate financially,
would not favour real Capital-holders to
half the extent that Mr. Colin M. Smith
imagines. The men who would reap the
advantage are those risky geniuses who can
skate on the edge of a financial ice-floe with-
out coming to much harm, and who exploit
hand-craft and brain-sweat with one hand
while they tear the vitals out pf the real,
solid and genuine capitalist on the other—
ex. grat., a facile-brained adventurer like
Mortimer H. Franklyn preying on the
vitals of the representatives of wealthy
integrity like the Hektys— and their in-
fluence in a State, instead of building up its
prosperity, tends ever to disaster and
ruin. The empire of Lons Napoleon was
such a financial bubble, and the French
Imperial Government fell with a crash as
soon as its credit was assailed. It was not
ended by its conquest by Germany, for it
had already ceased to exist as soon as it was
found necessary to go to war in order to
insure financial stability by a victory.
Carthage was a State in which all power
was vested in the hands of a commercial
oligarchy. The moment Carthage pushed
her devotion to money-making beyond a
point necessary to national salvation, and
intrusted her defence to paid mercenaries,
she fell. The life of a commercial State is
simply the life of any business undertaking
the nation must pay so much per cent, on
the capital invested, or collapse. Venice
and Genoa began in the deification of the
three golden balls ; and now they are whole-
sale water-side bagnios for courtezans and
princes-—“ the reward of Thrift.”
The Great Land Swindle.
Australia is pre-eminently the home of land-
speculation and land-swindles. There is pro-
bably more land in the market in Australia, in
proportion to the population, than there is in
any other country on earth. The principal
crop of this fertile continent is a harvest of arid
boards bearing the inscription: “These allot-
ments for sale,” and a hundred thousand fields
which ought to be rich with fruit or grain grow
nothing but a glaring placard apiece, announcing
that a desirable property is to be offered by
public auction. Nearly half the land-holders
of Australia never dream of turning the soil to
any profitable purpose ; they have never learned
to regard it as a means for the sustenance of
humanity, but only as a substance to be carved
out in small sub-divisions, and traded off on
instalment principles. There are more estate-
agents to the square mile in Australia than in
any other country known to geography ; also,
there are more building societies, land com-
panies, auctioneers, and syndicates in these
provinces than in any other civilised region.
There are six times as many allotments for sale
as a population of three million souls can
reasonably purchase, and any individual who
seems to want a patch of ground is liable to be
trodden to death by the frantic rush of agents
all desirous of making over to him all sorts and
varieties of property. Several thousands of
men scattered over every part of this continent
have no visible means of existence except by
loafing in a dingy office in company with a
dog-cared ledger, and waiting for a chance to
dispose of a quarter-acre of ground to any
victim who chances to pass by. Some of them
are willing to sell for a small deposit down, and
the balance to be paid in the dim, indefinite
future ; some require no deposit at all, and pro-
fess not to want the balance till the Day of
Judgment ; some want nothing whatever, by
their own showing, and will lend the buyer
money to build with as well. Most of them
simply put down in their books any property
that chances to be for sale, and wrest a com-
mission out of the vendor if they happen to
find a customer, and, as a consequence, twelve
or fifteen members of the tribe often live, or
attempt to live, on the effort to sell one allot-
ment which, as likely as not, proves unsaleable.
Also, they all have money to lend in sums
varying from £5O up to £5O 00Q, at the shortest
notice.
* # #
The average property-agent is a mystery.
As a rule, he is a dusty, seedy, middle-aged
individual, with a shifty eye, and a brown coat,
and a dusty, hard hat, and a wooden expression
like the side of a hut. Very few people ever
saw an old property-agent, or a young one,
and nobody ever attended a dead agent’s
funeral. ,1:1 is office is generally up a stair,
in a dark building opening out of a lane.
It consists mostly of one room, with an
ink-splashed deal table in it, and two inky
chairs, and a murky window, and there are
huge blots on the floor, as if he had wept ink
in some moment of depression when trade was
unusually bad. £ ery few people ever saw an
agent sell any property in one of these dens, or
found him collecting rent from anybody, or
discovered him in the act of lending a large
sum to anybody on mortgage ; and not one man
in a hundred, on going into the office, ever met
another man coming out. The inhabitant of
the premises is always found writing a letter
of some kind to an alleged client, and pre-
sumably he posts the letter in tire inside pocket
of his old, brown coat, and leaves it there to
all futurity. He comes early and keeps open
kite, with a dreary, yellow gas-jet flaring over
his head ; he never seems to think about any-
thing in particular ; he cats sadly at a second-
rate restaurant, and he is too sad to get drunk
—a jovially-intoxicated property-agent is an
unknown quantity. Presumably he lives some-
where, but this is not certain. He is only a
solemn, brown anomaly in an office, and appar-
ently he exists by sitting hard down on a chair,
and Ins use to the world at large is not worth
mentioning.
* * *
Now and then, however, some abnormally
bright and energetic specimen of the brother-
hood sells a suburban allotment on time-pay-
ment, generally to a member of the working
classes—the orthodox, dismal, faded agent never
sells anything. He probably collects a small
deposit, and executes a document by wdiich
his alleged principal owns up to the transaction,
and agrees to transfer the property in due legal
form, on receipt of the last instalment at some
period probably 10 years ahead. The buyer
generally takes the existence of this principal
for granted ; he also takes the ownership of the
land for granted ; and assumes that the title is
correct and thoroughly reliable. He further
assumes that there is no mortgage on the pro-
perty, or, if there is one, that the owner, or
the alleged owner, will pay the interest regu-
larly and meet the principal in due time. Or,
if he is sufficiently business-like to investigate
these points, and finds that everything is in
good order, he still has to assume that the
landholder will not mortgage the property at
some future time, or, if he does, that he will
meet the liability honourably ; that he
will not sell the land to a dozen different
individuals and mortgage it as well, and bolt
with the profits of the- nefarious transaction ;
that he will not go bankrupt f and that the
dreary middleman with the dismal countenance,


1 (he dismal office, and the hard hat, will
, ~„nblv pay over the money to his principal
lol f there is one—instead of embezzling it
1 vanishing. Lastly, he takes it as read that
a i coll pr will convey the land when the payments
th ® colll pleted, instead of simply taking all his
aF 1 and then laughing at him—as he is
m ° hied to do by the fact that the preliminary
f n , ovnenses involved in compelling the vendor
S £ article that I,as been bought and
■1 for are beyond the reach of the ordi-
palv humble investor. Among all these
h nces the position of the individual who
ft' U p a time-payment allotment is about as
Serous as that of a heretic in the Middle
an experimentalist who hauls on the
til of a tiger. # #
In New South Wales, at all events, the per-
on who sells land is one of the few who is
allowed to acquire money by false pretences
Sth absolute impunity. The dull, dusty
henomenon in the office is himself an almost
sufficient evidence of the dishonesty of his call-
j- or i ie is much too numerous to be supported
Kv the humble per centage which is supposed to
fall to his lot. The land-jobber may mortgage
1 is land to one individual and at the same time
sell it on- the instalment plan to another, but
though he takes all the latter’s savings he is in
uo way compelled to use the money in clearing
off the mortgage. He may simply appropriate
both the mortgage money and the purchase
money, and then go insolvent, in which case
the mortgagee takes everything, and the buyer
loses all his little pile, and has no redress. The
seller, of course, knows that the unpaid mort-
gagee’must foreclose ;he knows also that the
weak and confiding speculators who are toiling
to pay up the purchase money of their quarter-
acre allotments will never get anything
in return; and as he takes their coin through
a long series of years under the pro-
mise that they will receive a legal title
in exchange, which promise he deliberately
makes of no account, he thereby obtains money
by false pretences in the lowest, meanest, and
most degrading sense of the term. He lives by
absorbing the earnings of the industrious and
provident classes all through the best years of
their lives, and then reduces them to ruin in
their old age ; he softly absorbs the savings of
the household bread-winner, and when that
victim has lived and died in the endeavour to
make some provision for his family he leaves
the widow and the orphans to be thrown out
by the mortgagee. He is many degrees baser
and more heartless than the three-card man or
the totalisator fiend, and he compares badly
with the ordinary garrotter. But the laws are
mostly made by this particular variety of
vampire, and therefore his miserable fraud is
strictly protected by statute. If he were
allotted seven years penal servitude like any
other common swindler, more than one
prominent politician whom the world will here
name would now be pounding road-metal under
Government supervision.
# * *
The remedy for this astonishing state of
things is sufficiently simple. Every individual
selling land on the instalment plan should be
required to deposit the deeds in the Titles
Office, and to furnish the buyers with a certifi-
cate from that office stating that they have been
so deposited, and that they are free from all
encumbrance. There would be no hardship in
this, for —the land once sold—the seller could
not possibly want the deeds, save for purposes
of fraud, and he could make no possible proht
out of them by any honest process. They
cease, in fact, to belong to him from the
moment the sale is effected, and no individual
can claim to trade off a property and still keep
it in his own hands. Any attempt to sell land
on the instalment plan while a mortgage remains
upon it, or to sell it without depositing the
deeds, should be treated as a felony. If the
vendor requires immediate accommodation he can
mortgage the unpaid instalments to any extent
he pleases; in other words, he will be at liberty to
hypothecate his own interest, but will no longer
be permitted to trade off interests that are
not his own. The man who sells land would
then be placed on the same footing as the person
who sells any other material substance ; he
would be required to deliver the article for
which he had received payment, and any
attempt to obtain payment on a false pretence
of making delivery would be treated in the
same way as are false pretences in general. It
is a small thing to ask that a landlord should
not be allowed to sell the same article to two
different buyers, and take the value ■ from
each of them. But, so far, the legal
element in the Legislature has shown itself
strongly opposed to any change. The barrister,
as another variety of common swindler who is
authorised to take retainers under the false
pretence of doing work which he frequently
leaves undone, naturally sympathises with his
brother cormorant, and so far the people have
taken no effectual steps to gaol either of them,
but of late the land-instalment iniquity has
become too great a burden. The old, mysterious
property agent in his murky, ink-blotted office
was an incubus, but at the worst he was a
retail incubus, and he did his frauds in a small
and humble fashion ; but the insolvent “banks ”
and building societies, and the big land-boom
bends of recent years—which are the same
murky individual on a larger and hungrier
scale-have intensified the evil, and the case is
becoming every day more urgent.
Guaranteeing the Gallows.
A Sydney daily with approving unction quotes
irom Frisco Argonaut the subjoined paragraph
asi being unpleasant reading for the “ cranks”
who would abolish capital punishment:—
abolition of capital punishment is being written
vp° U i ll *'* le London press, with the effect of producing a
I 17 c 'ear-cut argument in favour of letting it remain. A
1 . r from a convict in Western Australia, telling an old
wi l n England that a murderous assault on a prison-
antcrmiKht be punished with hanging, had this expres-
: .' They tops a cove out here for slugging a bloke ”
, ean mg they hang a convict out here for assaulting a
aider). “That bit of a rope, dear Jack, is a great check
° n a man’s temper.”
Hie would-bo abolitionists of capital punish-
ment, among whpm The Bulletin is proud to
ei) tol itself, might have sought far ere finding
such an admirable argument to sustain their
own contentions as is here placed in their hands
by tire very greasers of the gallows-rope them-
selves. A convict’s testimony is urged in proof
of the assumption that capital punishment is
deterrent. .Now, a punishment is deterrent
in proportion to the certainty of its infliction,
in an inverse ratio to the probabilities
of escape. In the case of an imprisoned
convict, the certainty of detection of, and
of execution for, murder is practically abso-
lute ; the possibility, to say nothing of any
probability, of escape, nil. A prisoner-mur-
derer must slay his victim with the “bit of a
rope ” actually dangling in bis sight, with his
feet virtually on, and voluntarily placed upon,
the gallows-trap. Yet, are there not numerous
instances on record of prisoners having mur-
dered their fellows—either co-prisoners, or
(more frequently) prison officials? If the in-
violable practice of “ topping coves ” absolutely
put an end to all murders (or even murderous
assaults) by prisoners—an achievement the due
fulfilment of which could only be certified to by
the man who outlived the existence of all
prisons—there might be some reason in the
arguments of the hangmen; but even then,
only so far as would-be prisoner-murderers are
concerned. The same walled-in certainties of
detection and strangulation can never be applied
to incubating murderers who enjoy personal
liberty. To the free man, the gallows is only a
distant and a contingent menace and very often
not even so much as that. A hundred possible
loopholes of escape present themselves to his
mind. He may avoid detection, as untold
numbers do. How many secret poisoners have
never been found out? How many actual
murderers live still, unsuspected, honoured,
and even venerated ? It is at least analogically
probable that the percentage of uncaught
murderers is as large as that of any other class
of undetected offenders, and the records of
police bafflement place the latter at a high
average. Who can estimate how many success-
ful murderers stalk at large in Australia alone ?
Or the prospective murderer may forecast
equal chances of another being wrongfully
hanged or otherwise killed in his stead—as has
frequently happened. Who can say how many
Australian murders alone have been wrongfully
debited ? Camp-fire stories of dark deeds in
the solitude of the bush are overloaded with
such probable incidents —the isolation of two
men ; the swift bullet-messenger of one ; then
the falsely-witnessing aboriginal spear thrust
into the otherwise tell-tale aperture and left
there ; the finding of the body and the hurried
verdict against, and subsequent “ dispersion ”
of, the nearest blacks; all this is but a
commonplace phase of many possible variations.
* * *
And always present to the mind of a sane in-
tending murderer is one open avenue of escape
that looms in his meditative horizon as a certain
alternative to the gallows —that is suicide. He
argues that he can always take his own life.
When the avengers are on his track, it often
happens that he doesn’t do so—for varying
reasons; sometimes, but not often, out of newly-
born fear; at others, on the offchance of possible
acquittal by a jury. But while he is in the
stage preparatory to murder, the only stage to
which the gallows can act as a warning, the
suicide exit is with him a strong argument in
favor of his chances of escaping the rope.
Therefore, if hanging were held to be a de-
terrent to would-be prisoner-murderers—which
the facts of prison-life absolutely disprove—it
does not operate on free men or women outside.
What possible class of murderers does it deter ?
The murderer who, in an overwhelming fury of
hate, vows that he will have an enemy’s life,
and “ damn the consequences ? ” If one is in
that frame of mind and acts rrp to it, he or she
—frenziedly or coolly, according to tempera-
ment —kills the victim, gallows or no gallows.
He or she may be sorry afterwards, but that is
not what the gallows-man claims to want. He
claims to want him or her to be afraid
beforehand. Another sort of murderer kills
for gain. Hoes the gallows deter him ?
Never. All his ingenuity is expended in setting
his toils cunningly, in doing the deed secretly
and leaving no sign—in short, in fooling the
gallows. He fancies himself very much more
clever than all the murderers who have pre-
ceded him —it is the same with all your clever
embezzlers—and he is deterred, not from com-
mitting murder, but (as he thinks) only to the
extent of being found out. Occasionally he is
found out and hanged ; but that doesn’t prevent
others from risking the chance of detection, any
more than the frequency of shipwrecks deters
sailors from going to sea, or the accidents to
performing parachutists deter others from fling-
ing themselves from balloon-cars, for gain.
Until it can be made an every-day fact that the
detection of murder is inevitable, and a mur-
derer’s escape from the gallows is impossible,
the argument that hanging (or any other form
of capital punishment) is a deterrent leaks very
badly. Another variety of murderer is the one
who, so far as human enquiry can fathom, is
not swayed by any accountable motive ; he is
thick-skulled and brutish, and kills his
victim as horses or oxen might crush
obstacles beneath their hoofs. No argu-
ment could prevail against a murderer of
this class ; therefore, no displayed threats of
punishment could act upon him as deterrents.
# * *
The otherwise murderer, who is impression-
able enough to be scared from his purpose by a
dioramic vision of the gallows, is impossible ;
such an imagined being never could be a
murderer, for something or other would occur
to water his purpose. When the real impulse
to murder is aroused in the human breast, it is
an irresistible passion, overmastering and all-
effacing, except that it may have the chance
adjunct of cunning that attempts to defeat con-
sequences. It may also co-exist—and in the
prison instances probably always does co-exist
—with that absolute nausea of, life which
prompts suicide. Now, if men can’t resist the
impulse of suicide—that revolt against self-
preservation, the first law of nature—what fear
of punishment shall operate as a deterrent of
murder? Tiro prevalence of suicide furnishes a
strong argument against the gallows-pleaders.
The fact that some murderers commit suicide to
escape the gallows does not effect the efficacy of
this argument at all, since they did not refrain
from becoming murderers, and, in fact, the off-
chance of suicide was one of the assistant in-
centives which enabled them to proceed with
their desperate crimes. So much in absolute
disproof of the contentions of the gallowsphiles.
In the more pertinent enquiry as to the
iniquity of capital punishment, it is sufficient
to add mention of its chief and utterly inde-
fensible stain—the very nature of its operation
prevents it from ever rectifying a mistake.
When it does make a mistake, which is fre-
quently, it commits the very crime which it is
supposed to punish and prevent. When the
law kills the wrong person it makes its agents
murderers. And those agents form the only
class of murderers who always escape the
gallows.

As we wrote the foregoing last week,
two convicts lay in New South Wales gaols
awaiting the rope —(1) Maurice Dalton, a
grey-headed murderer who had by four years
exceeded man’s allotted life-span, and (2)
Harold Mallalieu, a criminal exactly half-a-
century younger. Dalton, a drunkard,
appears to have slain his nagging Avife in a fit
of ungovernable rage—temporary insanity—
arising out of her reproaches at his unwilling-
ness or inability to earn his living (though, as a
matter of fact, there is no absolute evidence that
his was the hand which killed her); Mallalieu
took the life of his mate, as the latter slept, in
the lonely bush, far remote from any human eye
save that of the assassin, who did not expect to be
found out, having made arrangements accord-
ingly. Where is the deterrent to the respective
classes of criminals or lunatics to which these
condamnes belong? And as in Mallalieu’s
case, so was it in the case of Hansen, executed
the other day for killing his mate, Duncker,
on the Broken-hill road. Hansen carefully
arranged that he should never be found out,
but he was detected after all. Yet no man
ever learns in such matters from any other
man’s experience—
All men think all men mortal but themselves ;
Themselves, when some alarming; shock of fate
Strikes through the wounded heart the sudden dread.
Mrs. Maybrick was convicted of poisoning her
husband, but she had arranged for not being
found out; and Mrs. Louisa Collins, of Sydney,
who had also arranged for escaping, poisoned
one and probably two husbands, and was found
out after all. And so all along the grim list of
the world’s murderers. Deliberate cold-blooded
murder (as in the Avell-known Sydney case of
Nicholls and Lester) is regarded by many —
more than people know of—as only an adven-
turous way of getting a living, like file-grinding
or shooting Niagara.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Queensland Immigration Vote.
The Queensland Coalition Cabinet has just got
its estimates through, including an item of
£64,000 for immigration purposes. Queens-
land, at the present moment, is in a woefully
bad way —in a worse way, probably, than any
other of the Australian provinces. There is
more hunger, more hopeless, abject misery, in
Brisbane alone than in any other Australian
city of twice the size, and the Premier’s office
is haunted by hunger-stricken deputations of
unemployed demanding work of any kind at
almost any price. The dull and callous
Griffith has one stereotyped answer to these
appeals, and it consists of a general assur-
ance that “no one shall be allowed to
starve in Queensland.” His petitioners are
starving ; their very presence gives the
lie direct to the smug politician who
insults their misery ; and they are left
to go on starving just as before. The blatant
Hodgkinson is ltill less sympathetic; he
merely announces in the Assembly that there
are “ a hundred places” in Queensland where
any man can get employment if he cares to go
there and look for it, but as HodgkinsoK never
gives the address of even one of those places he
is either coarsely indifferent to the sufferings of
the men and women and hungry children of
Queensland —or else he is lying. As for
Treasurer MTlwkaith, he only smiles his old,
fat, whiskyfied smile, and skirmishes after
fresh loans. Meanwhile, £64,000 are to be
extracted from the distressed population in order
to pay for bringing in more population to increase
the distress, and when the new consignments of
cheap paupers arrive, and can find no employ-
ment, and are run in for vagrancy, and sent to
gaol for sleeping on doorsteps, then they will
be taxed in their turn to bring in more cheap
paupers, and so on ad infinitum. The Queens-
land Government maintains an immigration
lecturer whose sole business it is to tell astound-
ing legends about Queensland as a new Paradise,
and the immigrants who have been attracted
by his soulful voice and his garbled statistics
are sleeping in boilers on the wharves at all the
ports from the Brisbane River up to the Gulf.
The province is choke-full of impoverished
humanity ; to bring in more under present con-
ditions is as utterly brutal as to import fresh
immigrants into a beleaguered city that is
already in the last stage of famine. If the
immigration money were dropped into a
quicksand or sent to the Imperial Insti-
tute it would be better expended ; in that in-
stance, it would only be lost—in the present
case it is employed to create untold suffering,
and expended in the purchase of misery. But
the Coalition, apparently, has no desire in
heaven or earth except to get cheap labour to
cultivate big estates ; its one ambition seems to
be to bring down wages, and thereby make
money for the monopolists, and the one sure
way to bring down wages is by creating hunger
and utter wretchedness. The four gods of the
Queensland Ministry are beef and hides and
tallow and wool, and it recognises nothing
beyond them. It is an utterly soulless and
animal aggregation of fat and grovel and cash,
and it would be better for its good name in the
days to come that its immigration vote had
been turned into coppers and hung round its
neck, and then that it had been dropped into
the Pacific and forgotten.
Those -whom the Lord hath Joined.
Last week Judge Windeyeb, sitting in state
and horse-hair wig for the purpose of putting
.asunder those whom the Lord had joined in
New South Wales, was induced to make some
vigorous comments on the stony brutality of the
divorce-law of that province. The case under
discussion was that of Barbara Freeman, who
testified that she had been kicked for thirty-
one years, in pursuance of the holy sacrament
of marriage. According to her evidence—which
Mr. Freeman seemingly made no effort to dis-
prove —she had, while in delicate health, been
flogged by the individual who took her for
better or worse, and thrown down a well thirty-
five feet deep, with ten feet of water at the
bottom. Then Mr. Freeman hauled her up
and dropped her down again, and hauled her
up again. She had been jumped on with
Mr. Freeman’s copious feet, and had been
starved, and struck in the face with the
butt end of a whip, and she had been
locked up in a damp cellar all through
a cold June night, along with her shivering
infant. Of all these things the divorce-law
took no notice whatsoever, and so far as it was
concerned the hob-nailed gentleman might have
pranced upon her till he grew too old to prance
any longer. But finally he fixed his affections
—which possibly meant his boots —upon some
other woman, and Judge Windeyer granted a
divorce upon the ground of adultery. The
divorce-law has a keen nose for this latter
offence, though of cruelty it takes no notice
whatever. Yet cruelty is, in every sense, the
worse offence of the two, and none save
a priest-ridden code could regard it other-
wise. A wrong that is unknown to the
injured party is practically no wrong at
all. Mr. Freeman or any other individual
might have committed adultery without his
injured partner being aware of the circum-
stance, and in that case her life would not be
one whit less happy for his backsliding ; but
he certainly could not jump on her with his
ponderous feet without her knowing the fact,
and suffering thereby. The injury concerning
which the law is so solicitous would assuredly
be a cruel one to any woman of a sensitive
order—if she chanced to become conscious of
it; the one which the law is not at all solicitous
about is cruel to any woman, and there is no
possibility of her finding refuge from it in ignor-
ance. The question at issue is not the moral or
snuffling aspect of the subject—simply regarded
as a struggle with the ten commandments, there
is as much reason why divorce should be granted
for a breach of one commandment as of any
other; the matter concerns exclusively the
suffering inflicted by one individual upon
another. Adultery does inflict suffering —pro-
bably in one case out of ten, the other nine not
being found out; boots applied to the head
inflict suffering every time. Assuming that the
adultery is found out, and allowing- for the fact
that the boots admit of no concealment, it is
even then only a question of which causes the
most pain, and the probability is that the
brutal assault is the worse of the two on all
occasions. The woman who suffers a moral
injury may forget her pain—in nine cases out
of ten she does ; the woman who is scarred
and disfigured and turned into a thing of
loathing never does. The present state of the
law arises partly out of Anglo-Saxon callous-
ness, and chiefly out of Anglo-Saxon hypocrisy.
The Church wants to hold marriage sacred
because divorce causes a falling-off in the
superstitious veneration for the parson’s
formula, and along with that there is an
inevitable falling-off in the takings. The
Church raised money for centuries on the
theory that marriage was a matter with which
it alone could interfere for good or evil, and
when the State interferes, either to make or
unmake marriages, then the Church gets into
the position of a prophet whose curse has
missed fire. It has asserted all along
that something # dreadful would happen to
anyone who attempted to undo its work—
nothing dreadful does happen, and thus
the priest is floored, and the bishop is bowled-
out, and a great deal of old reverence is lost.
And, therefore, the Pastor Smxffkins of the
period presents a. printed wail of remonstrance
to men like Mr. Freeman, and offers a cheap
tract to his miserable partner, and prays
for them both, and states through his nose as
before that those whom the Lord has joined no
man should put asunder.
Otago Witness thus sums up Salvationism :
The opposite poles of eeclesiastioism to-day are the
R.C. Church and the Salvation Army. Each of them
regards the other as a work of the devil. Yet they are
surprisingly alike. Each is a despotism ; each has its
Pope—(General Booth, it is to be noted, rather likes the
name “ Pone,” or “ Papa,” or “Generalhe asks, “what
does it matter?”);—each puts forth in the extreme form
the religion of authority; each exacts unquestioning
obedience. Which of the two has the stronger liking for
pomps and processions, vestments and ritual, it were
hard to say. The one is as old as the hills, the other is
the birth of yesterday, but for good, old-fashioned spiri-
tual autocracy of the mediaeval sort there isn’t a pin to
choose between them. If I wanted a religion to save me
the trouble of thinking, and keep me comfortably cock-
sure of everything, either would suit ; though on
grounds of taste I should be compelled to give the
preference to St. Joseph’s and Bishop Moran. The tim-
brels of the Hallelujah lasses are not to my liking, any
more than their poke-bonnets, or the “pious orgies” in
which they disport them. General Booth is an absolute
pope ; his whcle ecclesiastical system is summed up in
“ obey orders and ask no Questions.” Strange to say, his
people love to have it so. Talk about kissing the Pope’s
toe ! Is there a Salvationist in Dunedin who wouldn’t
think it an honour to lick the General’s boots? To people
who suppose that the religion of authority is played out
General Booth’s triumphal progress through the Austra-
lian colonies ought to be an eye-opener.

Someone signing himself “Henry Farmer”
writes in the Herald suggesting that the
lottery system should be adopted in all future
public loans in New South Wales, so that the
money may be raised in Australia instead of in
the English market as heretofore. The process
is exceedingly simple. The loan will be in, say,
£lO bonds, so as to be a handy means of invest-
ment, and thereby the Government will get the
money which now goes into shady banks,
bottomless mines, and totalisators run by
speculators with overhanging beaks and too
much jewellery. The interest will be fixed at
a low rate, and the loan, instead of falling due
in one lump, as at present, will be redeemed
by, say, 200 quarterly drawings—the bonds
which come out of the bag on each occasion

being paid off out of revenue. At each drawing
on a £5,000,000 loan there would be 2500 bonds
to be redeemed, and the first three drawn
would carry a big prize apiece. If £5OOO
or £lO,OOO were divided in this way —and the
same amount saved by cutting down the interest
—Young Australia would rush every loan that
was put on the market. It would be the big
consultation over again, with interest added on
instead of commission deducted ; it would be
absolutely safe, for the Government couldn’t
bolt the day before the drawing; it would
abolish all the ruinous charges for floating-
expenses, discounts, and other donations to
miscellaneous sharks ; and it would up-end the
British pawnbroker and make the country in-
dependent of outside assistance. Also, it would
enable the Government lo abolish all sweeps
except its own, and to wipe out every totalisator
barring its own totalisator, and if it isn’t a
moral device it is as moral as most things we
know of, anyhow. Subscriptions to be sent to

George Reid, the gentleman with the glass eye
and the happy smile, has been elected to suc-
ceed Parkes as leader of the New South Wales
Opposition. His first public act in his new
capacity was to wave the gory shirt of sectarian
hate, and to boil over concerning Dutch
William and the poor little ancient skirmish at
the Boyne. He raked up this battered legend
by the simple process of telling the Dices
Ministry that it ought not to rake it up, and
flourished the blood-stained rag of strife by
urging the other party not to flourish it. The
cause of his indignation was that Slattery, the
Roman Catholic, and Kidd, the Orangeman, sit
side by side in the Protectionist Cabinet. From
this fact it is evident that the Dibbs Government
does not intent to “travel on” religious rage, for
if it meant to trade on the Catholic block vote the
presence of Kidd would be fatal to it, and if
it intended to live on the support of the Orange
Party, Slattery would be a ruinous encum-
brance. It exists entirely on political issues,
and the fury of the politician with the vitreous
eye is roused purely because the new Cabinet
declines to live by howling about a dead and
gone row which took place between two foreign
nations at the other end of the globe some 200
years ago. Therefore Reid digs up the corpse
of the aged dissension—-which has not, and
never had, any more to do with Australia than
the wars of Jugurtiia and the Romans—and
while he shakes the venerable remains he howls
to his opponents not to shake them, and
at the same time he denounces them for
letting them rest. ' And now, we pre-
sume, the Evening News will take up the
parable as it did a few years ago, and
write another big curse (the last one was
written by a legal member of the present New
South Wales Opposition) because the Protec-
tionist Government is preserving an “ Ominous
Silence” on the subject of William lII.
which is much the same as complaining that it
is lying low on the topic of Julius Cjesar, and
isn’t making a really healthy row concerning one
Peter the Great, who used to have fits in Russia
about the early part of last century.
The cable-man on Carington :
The National Observer describes Lord Carington’s
recent speech at Bristol as “ blather.” While in S 3 dney,
it says, his indiscretions were concealed under a sporting-
exterior.
The Saturday Review ridicules the idea of Lord Caring-
ton pretending that the Conservatives are the foes of the
colonies, while the Liberals are their friends.
How much indiscretion can any man “conceal
under a sporting exterior ” ? and how does the
Observer suppose a Governor can hide his
political opinions by sending bashed footballers
home in Ids carriage ? Carington was a
failure; but when he had his sporting exterior
on he was as bad a failure as at any other time.
He was partly a swell-coachmqai gone wrong
and partly a clothes-stand and a wax image
out of a hairdresser’s window, and the only
time New South Wales ever wanted him for
any practical purpose—on the occasion of the
Mount Rennie case—it found him sitting up in
the latter capacity. It was a fine summer
morning, and Carington’s hair was looking
beautiful, and the hang of his new suit was
a joyful thing to contemplate, but the country
has now found that he was only hair and
clothes—that, apart from the “downiness”
which is acquired by every perky stable-boy,
he had no more brains than the average
barber’s clerk. He had one chance, and one
only, during his Governorship, to prove him-
self a manly Englishman who could uphold in
later days, and in the case of even the meanest
criminal who was yet a citizen over whom the
flag of his sovereign waved, the spirit of the
proud ancient boast, “ Civis Romanus sum /”
Yet he proved himself to be not a man, but a
mouse, not a great pro-consul with the true
kingly love of justice in his heart, but a nerve-
less popularity-hunter in whom the sense of
“British justice” was dead, or had not been
born—a man incapable of rising to a great
occasion and casting his official fortunes into the
scale alongside a principle worth dying for.
No, Charles Robert Baron Carington heard
not the voice of ideal British justice, but
only the brutal public’s frenzied bawl for the
blood of boys condemned to death without a
trial.
It is anything but unusual to read of con-
demned murderers eating and sleeping equably up
to the fatal morning when they are to meet their
mystery ; but it is seldom we hear of one so care-
ful of his health and so punctilious regarding his
meals as ttie late Maurice Dalton showed himself.
A week before his execution, finding himself
suffering from a cold, he insisted upon seeing the
gaol doctor, who prescribed a cough-mixture, and
he grumbled when taking his last breakfast that
the bread-and-butter was cut too thick for his
taste. One newspaper report says that Dalton
trembled at the moment the noose was being ad-
justed, but the fact is that Howard, who had
spent the night in oiling the rope, sent the knot
violently under the victim’s left ear and made him
stagger. He died with resolution and resignation,
and without making any statement, which is con-
sidered supererogatory by the R.C. Church after
a man has made bia peace with the Creator.
[?]
816 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, Nov. 25, 1891.
M v Dkar Mooradinua,—
In the “ Corsair,” at Sydney Royal, Fanny Liddiard is
the most gorgeous millinery interpreter observable in a
Haunting production, where the tights of the chorus show
signs of being French-chalked at the knees to conceal the
tide-marks of a long Melbourne run. Pale-blue and tan,
also heliotrope and silver, show Fanny off to the best
advantage, and if the beauteous Conrad is almost in-
audible when he raises his voice in a piratical lay, it is a
fault shared by the rest of the company, who are all
vocally worn-out with long-continued squawking. Vir-
ginia Earle (Bernhardt saw her in “ Evangeline ” and pro-
nounced that she had “charm”—she said George
Anson had it, too) has bazaar-doll frocking as Medora;
her most artistic attire was white silk with borderings of
gold, worn in the harem scene; but, like the rest of the
rags, it bore evidence of having seen service. The night
I suffered through the performance, the d.c. was quite
“ musical ” —Mrs, Vanderveer Greene, in black, with terra-
cotta bars; and the Misses Albu, in, respectively, black
and gold and cobweb-coloured lace.
Speaking of the “ stage-warblers do you know the
Victorian damsel (it all happened ever so long ago, of
course), who became suddenly paralysed by an opera-
singer at the theatre one night? She was engaged to a
sound and reliable M.L.C., and the double-event was to
come off in a month’s time, when (as luck would have
it) she and her elderly-looking, ugly lover, and her
purring mama paid a visit to the opera. The baritone
of the show had scarcely taken his vocal preliminary ere
the fiancee began to reach for her opera-glasses, and
glare fixedly at the nice young man, and exhibit other
rash symptoms —but the climax was yet to come. As the
show drew to an end the lady drew off her glove;
wrenched off the big diamond-ring the M.L.C. had given
her, tied it to her bouquet with her little pocket-hand-
kerchief and flung ring and flowers at the feet of the
grease-paint hero. The M.L.C. didn’t wait to be given
his matrimonial congi after that, and the lady eventually
married somebody else—not her footlight fancy, of
course.
There seems to be a slightly economical aspect about
being chummy with the gallant officers of the fleet
moored round about Barataria, especially when you
have a nursery-full of boy bantlings whom it is
your fad to dress up d la Jack Tar. Because you
can pick up any sort of straw hat to top tlum
off with, and dear Captain So-and-So finds a silk
ribbon with the name of his ship on it—he has lots in th e
stores and obliges his lady friends whenever Tommy wears
the last one out. These hat-bands, badges of friendship
with Captain Corcoran, or even Sir Joseph Porter—are
gratefully paraded by the recipients thereof, who hug
themselves over the fact that the ship’s bands aren’t sold
in the shops, and the miles-away gaze with which the
proud mama of the fleet-branded boylet regards the pitiful
little outsider with “Spitfire” or some such shop-sold
designation round his skull is lovely to see. Vice-regal
peop’e aren’t above snapping in a band for their small
nautical hopeful either, and a society woman in Barataria
rather spreads her features over the fact that her brat and
the Guv’nah’s are the only two favoured with bands off
the swellest ship in the squadron. Also (but this is quite
a stage aside) I hear of a beauteous society blonde who fell
in love with an officer, and got him to give her a pair of
those broadcast ribbons with the name of his ship in bold
gold letters—and now' she uses them to—er—keep her
hose from wrinkling.
Under the fostering care of “Charlie” Huenerbein a
series of six chamber matinee concerts—a musical Phoenix
from the ashes of the deceased Orpheus Society—started
on their careerinSydney Town-hall vestibule, on 17th inst.,
in the presence of about a dozen paying patients with a
residuum of dead-heads—but the room was only half-full,
even then. Concerts of strictly classical construction
held at the leisurely hour of three p.m. at a charge of
three shillings per seat must run to seed in Sydney—the
whole idea is too dear and dilettante to get on otherwise
than backwards beside the Beautiful Harbour. Artisti-
cally regarded, the first concert was a success—the opening
string quartette (Beethoven) with Poussard, Schmellits’
check (the society fiddler), Strauss and Rice as inter,
preters, and Deslouis’ rendering of Gounod’s “ Le Soir,’-
were the most inspired items on the card. The tenor of
the occasion was a strange sight who sang Beethoven’s
“Adelaide” in a small, hysterical voice and balanced a
calf-bound song-book as I have seen nurses balance a
baby, also his articulation was very mumble-jumble, and
one was glad to see him go. Miss Niay, at the pianor
played in greased-lightning way, but her right hand is
often completely drowned by her left, and she shouldn’t
use her fists as if they were the forelegs of a nose-action
trotter—it spoils the music. By the way, it got so dark
in the hall (never very bright in the sunniest day) that
artificial light was needed, and great giggling was heard
on the appearance of Charles aforesaid with a “dip” in a
tin-candlestick!
Talking of Music, heavenly maid, reminds me that a
forty h.p. lady contralto over whom all Australia made
such a fuss—doesn’t return love for love although we-
did shower her with flattery. At the saloon-table,,
going back, I am told she would dilate at great
length on the “ pigs’ manners of the colonials,” and how-
“ you could always tell an Australian by the way he used'
his serviette,” which was only another instance of “ set a-
thief to catch a thief,” you know, for in Sydney, at least,,
when the great songstress had finished stoking, it was
her habit to glance furtively round to see that nobody
was noticing, and then dexterously use her first Angel-
as a tooth-pick ! People liked her at first, but soom
wearied of her parrot-like remark : “ I must tell that to-
the Prince of Wales,” and her “personal” anecdote*
about Royalty made them feel tired. In Japan, on the
way home, she gave a hen tea-party, and, during its pro-
gress, told the assembled women, “The Queen kissed me
on this cheek.” But great was the she-baritone’s rage
when somebody chipped in—“ I suppose you haven’t
washed the place since? ”
“ All Sydney ” was under canvas last Saturday evening
—at Sells’ circus in Moore Park, with a strong sprinkling
of society in the dress-circle. Judge Windeyer and
daughters had a front seat, and the air was darkened with
doctors. Sells’ circus is far from being a sell. You
missed the quarantined gee-gees, of course, and the lovely
Amazons in festive array (the one in moss-green plush
shouldn’t yank her skirt quite so tight to the back, by the
way) could only wander aimlessly round the track on
their own little feet, and the procession of Romans (on
foot) was an excising spectacle, which only served to draw
attention to the bow-legs cl the equestiians. Also, the
glittering tiiumphal cars (on one, a gold-washed card-
board Jove offered a paper cockatoo to a pasteboard
Minerva) rather missed fire by being hauled round the
track by badly-matched circus hands instead of rearing
nags—but these were unavoidable drawbacks, which will
be got over in a little while. I fell hopelessly in love with
Major and Mrs. Rae, two dear, little human dolls wit.;
delightful manners themost courlier-like Johnny could
model himself on the Majors bow, and “how do?”—and
then the shadow of the giantess fell over me, and I couldn’t
help thinking, as I gazed up at her eight-feet-two of
massive womanhood (she carries her great height very
gracefully!, what a charming chaperone she would make !
You could see her coming such a long way off ! The
hippopotami—resembling huge pigs in the body, with
hides like badly-cooked Xmas pudding—were all there,
but among the animals, “ Sid,” the trick elephant, must
take leading laurels. To see him waltz, and sit down, and
fan himself, and drink from a bottle, and use a serviette to
dry his mouth, is to set him up as the Bernhardt of the
entire company.
The circus ladies are very well got up—on cigarette-
photo. models, with frantic golden hair—and the acrobats
are skin-fitted in dazzling style—all white spangled with
silver, looking lovely in the lime-light. The Gilfort
Brothers (a man from ’Ome tells me that he saw them
posing 25 years ago in London, so it probably isn’t all
padding underneath their pipe-clayed Jerseys) were
dramatic and artistic in their living statuary acts ; and
the Circassian lady snake-charmer’s parrot-like attire —
green and red—went against the pit, from which a still,
small voice penetratingly remarked, “ Pretty cooky !”
The patriotic dander of billy-boiling Australia ought to
arise at the news that English folks smile in a superior,
we-know-better-how-to-do-it way at the Antipodean
method of making tea. As a matter of fact, you rarely
get well-made tea in England any more than you do in
the Australian boarding-house, where Mary Jane nurses
the teapot on to the table 20 minutes before the gong
goes, then sets a kettle (they call it a “samovar” in
London) of half-boiled waiter next to it for the missus to
temper the tannin with, and gleefully rings people down
to be poisoned. The Australian bushraan, however,
knows how to make tea, and if he does in his thirst con-
sume that which he should not consume, the fact is to be
attributed to his carelessness, not to his ignorance. Boil
a billy of water, and while it is still boiling on the
fire throw in the necessary quantity of tea, stir it rapidly
three or four times and take it off instantly ; wait till the
herb sinks half-way to the bottom, and then pour off the
water into your quart-pot, and you will have perfect tea.
Melbourne Austral Salon (they had drafted a programme
de reception, which almost included laurel-wreaths and
incense) prostrated itself before Rudyard Kipling, who
paid them the compliment of two visits—the last to an
afternoon tea, when a full attendance resulted. Mr-
Kipling is described to me as “decidedly good-looking, and
below middle height, with well-developed chest and
shoulders.” He talks “ rapidly and incessantly, and has
the laugh of a schoolboy, and the assured manner of a
man who has been made much of by women.” lam per-
versely glad to hear that an artisth member of the salon,
who doesn’t keep her weather-eye on current literature >
didn’t quite “pick up her moorings,” so to speak, for on
being introduced to the god of the occasion, she peered
up into his face and said—“Do I know you? Have we
met before?” and then, turning to another member, asked
audibly, “ Who is he? What are they making such a fuss
over him for?” R. Kipling rather liked the onslaught of
beauty and genius, but two or three brothers of members,
who lent a hand in the hero-worship, got a rather hike,
warm reception. Later on, at the Yorick Club, the novelist
is reported to have given forth this rather cheap common-
place : “ I don’t mind being surrounded to the verge of
suffocation by a lot of good-looking women” (R.K. is
henceforth quite certain of his Melbourne readers), “ but I
strongly object to being loved by their little brothers.”
Sydney Women’s Literary Club let Rudyard K. “ slide.’
The S.W.L.C. is a small and lonely aggregate which wants
galvanizing badly. It is an abridged and bowdlerised
institution which declines to walk on the same side of the
street as George Eliot, and which wouldn’t invite Annie
Besant or “Ouida” (should they chance on Sydney) to
one of their dreary conventionals, because the former has
aired such improper topics, and Mrs. B. has said such
awful things. Nothing more excitingly literary than a
latter-day Doctor Watts or Maria Edgeworth would ever
be chased by this institution, and I hear that a member
wished she had died rather than done reverence to the
imminent Max O’Rell. I wonder how the pretty members
like the lines on which the Sydney Women’s Literary
Institution is conducted!
A story is told of how Rudyard Kipling’s frequently
abstracted gaze was misread by an irreverent young
lady on board the steamer. She was sitting next to the
litterateur at dinner one evening, and noticing him drop
his knife and fork, and begin glaring absently at his pro-
vender, she jogged his elbow and asked him in an anxious
whisper: “Goodness! is it a hair, or a fly, or what?”
R.K. ceased cogitating and went on with his masticating.
The latest addition to local melody is the “Cardross”
Valse, by John de S. Mann, of Sydney, who presents it to
an admiring world in a mulberry cover and five flats.
Nobody could whistle the music, but the one-two-three
is well-sustained, and if the ground-plan, as it were, of
the composition is reminiscent of boiler-making at a
distance, nobody who dances to it will have to put four
steps in the bar. .
SUMMER SONGLET.
“ How dost thou know when ’tis summer-time ? ”
Asked the “ pote ”of the maiden. Said she :
(And he waited rapt-eyed forherthoughlet sublime)
“ By the flies that drop into my tea.”
Paterfamilias to Private Secretary Goschen : “My good
lady and my daughters have spent so many pleasant
hours at Government ’Ouse that we’d be obliged to His
Ex. if ’ed give hus a border on Government ’Ouse, Mel-
bourne, as we’re goin’ there for a trip.”
The gentlemen who sat on the tables at N.S.W. Govern-
jnent House garden-party on Friday afternoon, with
their legs hanging found like a fringe, who sprawled on
the lawn smoking cutty pipes, while their better halves
investigated the drawers in the sideboards in their
rambles through' the vice-regal residence, probably
looked on the gubernatorial mansion as a public institu-
tion on inspection-day. lady who, not content with
a square feed on the took homewards in her
umbrella a bottle of— well, it wasn’t sarsaparilla—and
some cakes for the twins and Johnny, must have felt sad
when that striped handkerchief which she had hastily
used to secure her possessions in her umbrella came loose
and her adieux were cut short by a scatter of provisions
before the company. In future a large card, “Eat
all, but pocket none,” will adorn the verandahs at Sydney
Government House garden-parlies.
Doesn’t it amuse you, in an insolvent community
where one man in every ten finds even one cheap wify
miles beyond his means, to hear them joke and grig,
when the marriage-a-frost shriek rises on the breeze
about the expediency of polygamy to settle the woman
question ? Most of them couldn’t afford to embrace
Mormonism and two wives even if they wanted to! Xhe
“polygamy" jest runs on level lines with the “cock-
sureness” of the frayed bank-clerk on fifty- shillings
weekly, who solemnly tells you that he hasn’t quit e
made up his mind whether he will marry ornot.
Melbourne Austral Salon is again going to change
its locale, though they haven’t hit on a suitable
place so far. When the Athenaeum Club was to be let a
posse of Salonites bore down upon the lessee and patron-
izingly enquired the rental? “ One thousand pounds’’
was the laconic reply. The deputation fled precipitately
The “ Orlando ” dance on 17th instant was the brightest
spot in a yawning week, which was only roused by that
and the Government House garden-party to Parlia-
mentary, mayoral and aldermanic wights with their
lady relatives, who strayed about the lawn to the
strains of the P.A. band for an hour or two, and dis-
persed at 6 p.m. filled with loyalty, and tea, and gratifica-
tion. The other event—the “ Orlando ” dance—although
it rained Egeson s delight on the mystic date-got off very
well in spite of the fact that Governor Jersey didn’t go
owing to the falling water, and that the frocking of the
women present (headed by Lady Charles Scott) presented
a foundered appearance round the hems. The warlike
vessel (some people object to her on social occasions, since
the flagship is for use, and sassiety bumps its bunions
against the big guns in the mazy waltz) was disguised in
flowers; the music was good, and the hop was a success.
Musical people on tour have to face queer houses some-
times. Flautist Lemmone, just back from a provincial
raid, tells of one “ picturesque ” audience of rabbiters in
gore-stained garments, and fresh-caught “ bullockies’’
who, moved by the rolling rhythm, rose and cracked their
whips together in time to the music ! At one way-back
one-night township the man in front was accosted by a
small, touzled, barefooted specimen of bush-gal who
wanted to get in on the nod, “ because I loves to hear ’em
singing, mister, an’ I’m stone-broke!” She had a front
seat.
I am told that the Sydney Women’s Literary Society
possesses a member who bewails the univeisality of The
Bulletin’s circulation, and who, by her own confession
as made in the peroration of a paper read before the mem-
bers on Monday, 16th inst., would like to scratch the eves
out of
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
The N.S.W. Government is two Ministers
short. There aren't two morning papers in the
Dihhs Cabinet.
The chief actor in the recent big Tas-
manian scandal wanted to maqry the young lady
involved, but her people declined.
A man used to lecture in Melbourne,
proving that all the next generation must be
teetotallers. But his widow kept a hotel.
A rather startling, but Pharisaically-logical
social development has occurred as the result of
the paper read, by a now well-advertised lady, at
a recent meeting of the N.S.W. Woman’s Suffrage
Association.
Tom Westbrook, the Hobart auctioneer,
suggests in the press, that a day be set apart for
national prayer, to avert influenza, typhoid, etc,
A local clergyman scouts the idea in favour of a
back-yard-cleaning campaign.
It is cabled that Sir George Grey “is
likely to be appointed to the vacant governorship
of New Zealand.” What next will the cableman
ask us to swallow? Why, the crowd which
refused to Higinbotham the Victorian Lieutenant-
Governorship are still in power.
Why can't the police catch A. H. M‘Cul-
loch, Esq., solicitor, late of Sydney, whom so
many people want to see so badly, and who is
still in Australia? A, H. M'Culloch, Esq., is, it
■is true, high up in a certain secret organisation,
but surely there must be a few people “ not in the
ring.”
A recently-elected N.S.W. member of
Parliament, the other day, appeared in the local
halls of legislation with a pipe in his mouth.
Were a vote taken as to smoking in the Chamber
it is quite likely that the “ayes’ would have
many votes. They smoke during debates at the
Trades and Labour Council.
Bell and Davis managed to “ slew ” the
post-office authorities in Sydney and San Fran-
ciso ; ergo they “ slewed ” the detectives. The
detectives, when they want to catch you, first
enquire: “ Who is his girl?” and secondly,
“ Where will his letters be addressed ? ” If they
can’t answer either question they are as helpless as
cataleptic infants.
It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Co’s. “Cascade”
80 & 82 Elizabeth-street, near King-street, is just
the place; it is certainly the largest and best
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*

Under ordinary circumstances a hippo-
without horses as a place of amusement
flro 'id be as diverting as Sheol after Satan had
bppn shelved on a retiring-allowance. But your
.id newspaper man is always equal to every
Irnpra-ency, and Editor Stow is prepared to run
onreessfuily Sells’ Bros. Circus on stilts should no
S ther adjuncts to locomotion be obtainable.
Therefore is the mammoth show at Moore Park a
beam in the eyes of theatrical managers and a
Brobdingnagian blister on their treasuries. Moat
f Sells’wild beasts don’t shine brightly enough
m irive sunstroke when contemplated severely.
Y o ur much-travelled lion is usually only a fourth-
Ate door-mat—but their hippopotami are hogs of
hiffh degree, and their performing elephants, five
in number, are things to shed tears of joy over.
It is impossible to view critically three circus
displays in three rings at one time without
losing an eyeball or even two, and so
Colonel Sellars might with advantage lay on
an oculist in the interests of suffering journalism.
So far as two eyes were permitted to observe, out
of 100 performers—wire-walkers, pole-climbers,
weight-lifters, attitudinisers, trapezists, giants,
dwarfs, air-jumpers, bar-athletes, contortionists,
cyclists, gymnasts, jugglers, tumblers, Japanese,
and Arabs—Sells haven’t got a duffer. Best to
bur mind are the Silbons, Stirks, Costellos (on
horizontal bars) Rex and Reno, simply wonderful
contortionists, the Gilforts, as Grecian statues,
and some of the Arab and Jap oerformers. As
for the “ female giantess ” (see bills) she looks at
least eight feet high and every inch a lady; unlike
ordinary giantesses—usually mannish creatures—
she has no moustache and a fine pectoral develop-
ment. But the bearded lady has hair enough for
a mattress-factory, and the lady serpent-charmer
handles cobra and anaconda as carelessly as if
they were indiarubber piping. We have slain
many circus-clowns in bur time—the sharks of
Sydney Harbour are simply choked with their
bones—but we have left Dan Ryan off our black
list; he is funny.

“The Little Widow,” a farcical comedy by
the English author, F. Jarman, now running at
Sydney Garrick, is, on the whole, amusing,
especially in the second act. Wilkins Parker (H.
Shine), an amateur mesmerist, having put a
“ hawful hugly ” female “ under the influence ” at
a public meeting, is unable afterwards to get rid
of her. At the same time “the little widow”
(Jennie Lee) comes on a self-invited visit to
Wilkins’ brother Arthur (Frank Cates), and the
situation is complicated by the arrival of Mrs.
Parker (Constance Deorwyn) and Arthur’s fiancee,
Emily. The fun then arises out of the necessity
for Jceeping the foreign woman out of sight.
H. Shine, Jennie Lee, and Frank Cates, in the
order named, have most of the “ fat,” but the
performance is that of G. P. Carey, whose in-
dividuality is completely merged in that of the
wife-hunting restaurateur. The “hawful hugly
’un,” with the stony stare, the large mouth, and
insatiable appetite, is admirably conceived and
carried out by “our Mary Ann.” Jennie Lee is,
of course, bright and lively as Constance Rattle-
brain, and Shine’s is not a bad performance. “Jo”
will probably go up on Saturday night.
** * *
“ Schoolmistress,” after eight months’
vacation, has proved profitable at Sydney Cri-
terion during its six nights’ run. The manage-
ment have accepted The Bulletin’s last season
hint, and Maggie Moore now, by way of rehearsal,
lights up the first act with a waltz song of the
minstrel type. The little lady’s best effort is in
the long denunciation of her husband. That blue-
blooded pauper is again ably handled by Dot
Boucicault, now scarcely so much collar-throttled
as previously. Titheradge by no means fills the
sea-boots of Admiral Rankling, formerly stretched
to their utmost by Anson. Miss Romer, as the
down-trodden worm of the naval bully, repeats a
former success, as do Percy Lyndal, Chichester,
Bessie Mayor, and Master Whyte. Miss Spong,
as Mrs. Paulwer, goes up one into the wed-
ding - slippers vacated by Emma Temple, and
Mr. Watson is too large and lubberly as
Tyler, the page, G. L. Gordon, as the German
composer, Bernstein, does not lose by comparison
with his predecessor, Mr. Clitherow. “Pick-
pocket” goes up on Saturday, and on sth Decem-
ber Williamson’s Juvenile Opera Co. open in
“The Mikado.” J.C.W. seems to have temporarily
deserted the Castlereagh-street theatres.
#* * *
The art of modern play-acting is to amuse.
Therefore, to those who laugh heartily, enquiry
into the reasons for their mirth is not necessary.
Their cachinnation serves as the laughter-giver’s
defender and best apology. “ The Corsair,” being
built on similar lines to “ Cinder-Ellen ” et hoc
genus omne, the Sydney audiences that lately
laughed so consumedly at the latter show cannot
consistently cavil at the former. Business has,
despite prevailing depression, been unvaryingly
good with “The Corsair,” but the event of the
season so far has been the gallery demon-
stration of the third night. On that occa-
sion the fair and fat Fortescue was singing
that most inane of all music-hall ditties,
“For Goodness Sake don’t say I told You,” and,
enthusiastically called, re-called, and re-re-called
for “The Man in the Moon,” kept repeating,
“For Goodness Sake,” &c., till he could scarcely
wheeze. Then he suddenly stopped, while the
“ gods,” or rather a rowdy section of these uppish
folks, kept on whistling, yelling, and tramping.
James MacMahpn came on but wasn’t heard,
and after the omission of several items, and at a
period when half the circle and two or three rows
of stalls had filed out, the show was allowed to go
on. Now, the management announce that the
Theatre Royal is not stage-managed from the
gallery, and that “Man in the Moon” belongs to
“Evangeline” and will only be sung when that
musical heifer occupies the stage,
* * # *
“Youth” holds its own at Sydney Her
Majesty’s during a period of theatrical dearth and
disaster unprecedented in the memories of local
managers. Dress-circle folks always have nerves,
and as the sudden banging of 100 guns is a shock-
producer to which smelling-salts is a poor antidote,
why, the bongtong don’t exactly froth over the
plush-covered barriers into the stalls. But the
house otherwise is fairly filled, and this play, the
joint production of Sir “Gussy” Harris, Pettitt
and Merrit, may hold the fort until Santa Claus
comes along with “ The Babes in the Wood,” and
Maggie Moore again in the lead. If it doesn’t,
Mr. Rignold has got something good up his sleeve.
* * * *
It is rather late in the day, but neverthe-
less the fact, painful though it be, must be
chronicled. Manager Beresford, of the Cyclorama,
has been compelled to retire on account of the
prevailing malady, and a gentleman named Bogie
reigns in his stead. The Oyclorama’s orchestra
has, therefore, been compelled to drop one musical
item from its programme.
* * * *
Manager Wyburd bubbles over with joy,
for the plate-glass for his fish-tanks has arrived,
and all Sydney may soon see at Bondi what it can
never hope to see at breakfast time — i.e., fresh
fish. Meantime, Sylvo, one of the smartest pre-
stidigitateurs extant, and other good men are
showing there.
* * * *
Now that the hot summer has begun, and
the Australian is filled with a great longing to
look at the cool, green sea, Coogee Aquarium is
booming violently. Manager Larmour has taken
a lease of those sweet singers, the Misses Albu,
also the Elite Quartette out of the “ Corsair,” and
in consequence the success of his Sunday con-
certs is something large. Also, there are all
manner of other attractions, including monsters of
the deep, and cool green spots, and refreshing
drinks, and lovely scenery ad lib, and, therefore,
the Coogee Palace is full while the churches are
emptv.
* * * *
“ Rob Roy ” is running a second week at
Melbourne Royal, and a score of supers in naked
knock-knees continue to make a dismal pretence
of staining their native heath with Sassenach
gore. They are a very job-lot of outlaws, these
followers of the bold Macgregor. A wild life
amongst the hills and crags of Bonnie Scotland
probably accounts for their ill and scraggy appear-
ance, or, perhaps, they have become lean and
leaden-eyed through croaking bacchanalian
choruses when they are quaffing nothing out of
empty drinking-cups. One might suggest a whole
heap of reasons why these ruthless marauders
should look so crushed. For instance, they can’t
help noticing that Rob and Mrs. Mac. are trying
to palm off upon them a couple of slips of girls as
a pair of sturdy sons. Desperate men don’t like
to have their intelligence insulted in this manner,
yet they are expected to stand around and beam
with pride whilst their gallant chieftain pitches
such yarns concerning the brawn and muscle of his
bogus hoys that it’s a wonder he doesn’t blow them
into the footlights. The spectacular scenes of “Rob
Roy ” are ruined by the feeble presence of the
Macgregors junior, who ought to retire from law-
less life, and take to darning their pa’s socks.
Fortunately there is something to admire in the
aspect of Bentley, who now plays the name-part
with a little more breadth of style than at the
outset, and is manly and natural all the time.
Eloise Juno, as the raging mother of Helen’s
babies, is not so natural, yet she also is manly—
moreover, she is careful, like her chieftain, to
avoid chipping in with a tune at unexpected
moments. But the Macgregors are little more
than ornamental features of the production, after
all. Cathcart and Armes Beaumont almost
mononolise the foreground, in turns, or both
together, and the entertainment is mostly wob-
bling between old comedy and ballad opera.
• # *
Cathcarts sound though stagey performance
of Nicol Jarvie deserves a good deal of the favour
it meets with, and although Armes Beaumont
doesn’t score heavily as a dashing gallant and
serious stage - lover, he preserves the musical
portion of the trouble from unmitigated contempt,
A Mr. George Manson, as the Dougal Creature,
gives an apparently faithful representation of that
uncombed heathen, and Albert Bernard gets some
fun out of his Major Galbraith. Alderson, the
evil Rashleigh Osbaldistone (a cunning chiel),
conveys the notion of a pirate trying to crouch
into his big boots, and most of the others are
subjects too painful for discussion. “ Rob Roy,”
which is creditably mounted, has a reasonable
chance, at time of writing, of hanging on for a
few nights longer, but “ Hamlet” is in rehearsal.
* * * *
A revival of “The Gondoliers” caused
the Princess’ to fill right up on Saturday night.
Custom doesn’t stale the music and humour of
Gilbert and Sullivan’s latest (and possibly last)
opera—nay, the managerial declaration that it
grows upon the understanding and improves upon
acquaintance is a plain truth. Shortcomings in
the cast are even more noticeable than of yore,
however. When a merry maiden marries she is
usually a few feet taller than Flora Graupner, or
Violet Varley. The substitutions of shrinking
Violet for Ida Osborne, and of tall Bracy for
Leumane, bring urgent necessity for full-grown,
graceful lady principals prominently before the
public. The former standard of vocalism is more
than maintained, though. Fair Florence Young
improves each shining hour, and ; the valuable
voice of the new contralto, Opie, calls
attention to the momentary apparition of the
mother of Barataria’s lawful sovereign.
* * * *
Melbourne Alexandra re-opened on Satur-
day with a new nightmare of local interest,
hatched by the heated imaginations of Dampier
and Garnet Walch, and entitled “ This Great
City.” The accent is on the This, because Andrew
Halliday once wrote a drama called “ The Great
City,” in which Madge Robertson made her Lon-
don debfit, and was abducted by the dingy agents
of a cronk financier, much as Lily Dampier is
taken captive in the lurid narrative under notice.
Otherwise there is no resemblance between the
two dramas. Melbourne seems to be deeper sunk
in crime and richer in howling lunacy than the
London of poor Halliday’s time. Most of the
Dampier-Waloh creations are bent on destruction,
and they can’t fix their horrid gaze upon the
casual stranger for ten seconds without wanting to
east him into eternity and purloin his “ papers.”
Women seem to them as bits of portable property,
to be picked up by the way and carried to a place
of safety, for fear the poor things might get wind
of the stolen will and do something that would
burst up the boss villain and ruin all.
# * *
The exact plot of “ This Great City ” is
generally lost in a murky atmosphere of crime,
but as far as can be gathered in the darkness
there is a missing document at the root of the
matter, and if a mild young villain in a sham
beard could but contrive to find this paper and
marry the girl, then a lot of other miscreants
might go whacks in the spoil, or something of that
sort. The trouble is to discover which of the two
Dampier damsels he has concentrated his wicked
eye on, because there’s a more elderly monster,
who seems to' want the other, and when a couple
of hired abductors prowl into the young ladies’
humble garret, remarking, “ It’s the fair one
we’ve got to take,” and try to take Lily
(who is a dark one) the plot thickens worse
than before. Nothing is ever certain except
the providential arrival of Alfred Dampier
at the right time, and the opportune
assistance of Mrs. D., who is well-suited
with a low-comedy part. Satisfactorily played in
the popular Alexandra style, there was no doubt
about “ This Great City ” catching on. Its local
allusions kept a large, excited audience in roars of
glee, and each stage-picture of an old familiar
spot, notably Sandriclge Pier by Night, went
home to a couple of thousand ’onest ’arts. The
Alexandra is a little world in itself, always worth
visiting when the Dampiers are in possession, and
the masses get a fair show to fire off their
feelings.
** * *
“Doctor Bill,” revived for a short season,
drew another big crowd to the Bijou. One or
two minor changes from the previous Melbourne
cast are improvements rather than otherwise, and
the social disturbances brought about by Anson’s
unhappy meddling with that extinct volcano, his
son-in-law, are excruciatingly funny to such as
haven’t already seen the riot. And although the
kangaroo dance has lost much of its early bloom,
and the hunt for the lost door-key is less of a
genuine novelty than aforetime, “ Dr. Bill ” ought
to prove a successful nerves-soother until Decem-
ber sth, after which date Myra Kemble takes her
medical adviser for a tour through Maoriland.
** * *
The halls and other perennial shows are
doing fairly well, or more so, but the desire to
hear more about Stanley and his heroism was not
strong enough to burst the Town-hall walls
asunder last Saturday. His two farewell sermons
w w to begin in the Athenaeum on Monday and
Tuesday.

George Darrell didn’t appear at Melbourne
Opera House on the date Originally mentioned.
The theatre has been shut up of late, and there
was an anxious period of doubt as to whether
George would be able to appear at all. It was a
terrible time for patrons of the drama, but all
promises to go well with them now, as George is
definitely announced to start the job this Satur-
day (28th). On that occasion the author-actor
purposes to submit “ Hue and Cry ” to the Critics
and Playgoers of Melbourne for Approval or Con-
demnation prior to its Presentation in England.
From which it would appear that if Melbourne
were to condemn the Darrellian effort with a
cartload of bricks, or a ton of bananas, he would
give the Britishers a chance to fall down and w***’-
ship it, all the same.

Gerald and Duff are not likely to make a
fortune over their dramatic season at the Ade-
laide Royal. This, however, is not altogether
surprising, as their dramas up to date are not
very wholesome, and, with one or two exceptions,
the company is decidedly frail. “The Points-
man,” with its railway collision and other
harrowing incidents, was not a great draw,
and The Bulletin passes over with contempt
the production of “ East Lynne.” Also, it hereby
offers a reward to the man, woman, or child who
will slay every member of the next company
that places this play before an already too
persecuted public. “The Silver King” is now
being tried. At the Town Hall, Snazelle has
finished up what should prove a remunerative
season. As the excellence of his entertainment
became known business improved rapidly. The
story of “ Enoch Arden,” with beautiful realistic
pictures illustrating the various scenes, was a big
attraction.
At Poverty Point.
From one of the Southern coffee - palaces conies a
pretty story of propriety avenged. The heroine, an
alleged artiste of a certain comic opera company, had
stooped to conquer the “ boots,” and that fortunate
nobleman’s neglect to rise with the lark and put the usual
polish on ’em led to a managerial discovery of a delicate
nature. The first virtuous impulse of the management
was to make a shocking example of the consenting syren
by requesting her to withdraw. Lodgers are lodgers,
however, in these hard times, and woman is generally-
admitted to be the weaker vessel. It was ultimately
decided that the difficulty could be got over, in a
respectable business-like way, by “ sacking ” that miser-
able profligate the “ boots,” and letting his lively
“ victim ” stay on.
When the father of the late Peter Mansergh, the
(Melbourne) Irish comedian, waited upon old Billy
Hoskins to negotiate a professional engagement for his
son, Billy’s first question settled the matter. “ Can your
son eat sawdust without butter ? If he can’t there is no
use in trying the stage,” Peter was more or less a
failure.
Perhaps in the whole of Australia there is no better-
known theatrical than Jimmy South, and the veteran
is copper-fastened throughout and, like Parkes’ “ Ragged
Jane,” “what he don’t know is not worth knowing.”
When Jimmy sued Carroll and wife (Emma Wangenheim)
in Brisbane recently, South’s own lawyer (Preske) had
got along with the examination in chief of his client to—
“ And this Emma Wangenheim is the defendant Carroll’s
wife?” “Yes”—-when up sprang Lawyer Rutledge to
score a point. “How do you know she is his wife?”
“ Wuw—well,” says Jimmy, “I know'it.” “ You know
it, sir ? How do you know the female defendant is Mr.
Carroll’s wife, sir? Now, you’re on your oath, sir!”
“ Well, I ought to know it, sir. Why, I gave her away in
marriage.” Then Rutledge sat down with a thud that
shook the court.
Mine. Fanuitza, the well-known and fetching “ Witch
of Atlas,” has turned up again in Sydney after two years’
visit to Europe.
The burly, massive Sala, who is not wholly unlike the
great and blubbery G.A.S., is again to the fore with some
petrifactions from romantic Cow Flat. He claims to have
discovered a second marble man, who this time is in a
crouching position, like the Listening Slave ; also a horse,
a prehistoric elephant, several snakes and lizards, with an
enormous fish, “ very like a whale." Sala has begun to
theorise learnedly, and he ’spects he has lighted on the
bed of a cave, where a federal council of antediluvian
creatures was held. At one time he purposed putting a
shot into the elephant’s trunk, so as to convince the
sceptics, but finally decided to have the monsters photoed.
He adheres to his statements with the equanimity of Don
Quixote after he had been in the cave of Montesinos, and
on the whole he is much more interesting than theSku-
thorpes. Pygmalion Sala sticks to the authenticity of
the Original Marble Man.
An old play said to be Boucicault’s, called “ ’99,” is dug
out at the London Standard Theatre and is an impudent
plagiarism from the “ Sea of Ice.”
Every reason to believe that Melba will be here in '92.

Carden, Cates, Collier.
Bush-Preacher Westwood is flattered by being mistaken
for Booth, but his bugbear was poor old Pether Cavunp-

Here is an anecdote related by an Irish comedian of an
experience he once had in the Isle of Wight. The place
was Yentnor, and the prospects of a good “house ” were
dark. It occurred to the Hibernian artist to inquire if
there was an Irish quarter in the town, so he said to his
host, a hotel-keeper, “ Have you many Irish here ?” “ No,”
was the ingenuous reply, “ we are remarkably free from
them !” S. F. Argonaut.
Myra Kemble, with “Dr. Bill,” struck a N.Q. town
recently. She found herself unknown, and one inhabitant
asked the manager—" ’As she ever played with Dan
Barry ?” “No.” “Then she ain't no manner o’good.”
And the mirthful Myra fled from the settlement.
Myra Kemble tells with gusto this story. She was at
Armidale, N.S.W., enjoying the balmy twilight on the
balcony of her hotel. Suddenly she awoke to find herself
famous by means of the town-crier ! Seated on a sorry-
looking Rosinante, the ceaseless clatter in whose ears
apparently induced a slumberous meditation, the crier
authoritatively rang his bell and announced, “ To-night 1
to-night! to-night! Roll up, roll up, roll up, all of yez 1
Miss Maria Campbell, acknowledged the bow idol of her
perfeshun, will produce ‘Dr. Bill,’ with all the original
limelight effects, and 14 stock star artists at the back of
her! Also, this afternoon, 100 prime wethers, and 100
bullocks rolling fat, 5 pigs,” &c., &c., &c.
Melba says that she can have musical engagements at
Paris all the year round, never singing for less than £l5O
at a soiree.

It w r as the shallowest of devices to advertise Walter
Bentley as “ the famous Scotch tragedian,” simply because
he was making his first appearance in “Rob Roy.” The
public will naturally associate him in their minds with an
everlasting Scotch accent, and be disposed to take it for
granted that for characters like Hamlet he might just as
well be Grattan Biggs.
The divine Sara is now reported in the Era to have
remitted £20,000 from Sydney to Paris to be invested in

The bills at the Garrick read ; “ Jenny Lee Run Wild

I had the pleasure of meeting Miss Ada Behan last
w’eek (writes The Bulletin’s London correspondent). She
is dying (she says) to pay a visit to Australia, of which she
has heard so much; and she hopes, with the help of John
Drew, who is equally anxious to see Kangarooland, to
induce Daly to try a venture there. Miss Behan is quite
fascinated with the Poet Laureate, and intends to work
her hardest to make his “Maid Marian” a success.
Tennyson has made several important alterations in the
leading part to suit her.
Melbourne shareholders in the original “Waterloo”
Cyclorama Company have, in a few instances, sold out
and bought fresh shares in “The Siege of Paris.” Both
shows are being run by the same company, a fact which
doesn’t appear to be clearly understood on ’Change, or by
stock and share reporters for the dailies. The Argus, for
example, gravely stated that “Waterloos” had fallen on
account of the popularity of “ The Siege.”
The memory of Bookstall Smith, deceased, will last just
as long as “Pinafore” does. When “Pinafore” is for-

Smith.
The Booth, referring to the action taken by the Ballarat
authorities to stop the Salvation circus-parade through
the streets, says:—“ If the whole of Australia were to rise
up and forbid us, we would unhesitatingly continue our
work.” Probably, but not in Australia, anyway. Nobody
but a blatherskiting showman would talk that way.
It is not generally known that Nellie Melba once ap-
peared under J. 0. Williamson’s management. It was
when J.C.W. was running young John Kruse. The com-

After “ Canon B. S. Smythe ” has finished with Stanley,

“ Jolly ” Nash has been proestting against the proposed

the innocuous school of comiques, and makes money by
warbling at church h’outings and Bible-class corroborees.
Most comiques would stand a better chance of getting to
the sweet by-and-bye if they did nothing worse than

Yet another Tasmanian veteran, Francis

David Christie Murray vented a mouthful
of contempt on Australians because they don’t all

“What’s become of Waring?” was Alfred

A certain N.S.W, statesman, whose in-

The defeated Parkes lay back in his chair

One of the leading lawyers of New York
is a Bendigo native. Thirty years ago he got

and in a few years held his own against all-
comers.
David Christie Murray was arrested on

To his dying day Parnell believed that a
certain well-known enemy of his, not Pigott,
was the forger of the celebrated letters. Nothing
would convince him to the contrary. Kven after
Pigott’s admission he continued to say that if

inspired the forgery.

ANXOUS WIFE : “He came home at lunch-time, apparently as usual, and told me he had
bought a new novel—that the story was laid in England, the principal here being
a retired Queenslander who had made his fortune by farming in Queensland.
Then he threw himself on the sofa and has never stopped laughing since.”
Which reminds one of what G. R. Sims lately
said when taunted with being a Jew : “ All
clever men are more or less Jewish.”
Some descriptions of the brilliant and
brilliantly red-headed poet, Swinburne, are going
the rounds of the papers. We saw him once in
London. His rufous hair excepted, he is the
image, on a smaller scale, of Henry Kendall, who
was dark-haired. The woebegonencss which was
the Australian poet’s distinctive expression is all
there.
Paperhanger Searles, cf ’Frisco, who
married the multi-millionairess, Mrs. Hopkins, and
was bequeathed every cent of her money—some-
where between .£0,000,000 and £l4,ooo,ooo—and
who is being sued by Timothy Hopkins, deceased's
adopted son, who seeks to upset the will, has
offered the latter £1,000,000 to compromise. Hop-
kins declines, and stands out for 10,000,000 dols.
or £2,000,000.
A Mr; H. J, Merriman, in Lloyds, tells
another story of how Nelson died. Forty years
ago he frequently came in contact with a Tra-
falgar veteran, named Williams, who had been
Nelson’s cabin-boy, and who described the A dmiral
as a martinet disliked by his men in general. He
says that Nelson was shot by one of his own top-
men in revenge for harsh treatment.
The late Edward Deas-Thomson, before his
knighthood, was a director at Sydney of the
Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Co.,
of which Alfred Stanger-Leathes was secretary.
At a board meeting one day, Mr. Thomson said,
“Mr. Leathes —” “I beg your pardon, Mi'.
Thomson, my name is Stanger-Leathes.” “ And
mine,” quoth the ex-imperialist, “is Deas-
Thomson.”
Mr. Sharp, of Newcastle, N.S.W., can
neither hear nor speak, but if you face him, at
any reasonable distance, and write in the air with
your finger, he will read the inverted and
invisible hieroglyphics with the utmost ease. He
will also tell you what you write on his back.
He will watcli you writing, from the front, with
only the top of your pen exposed to view, and tell
you what you have written. He exerts this
power with the utmost rapidity and with no more
difficulty than the ordinary reader who watches
the penmanship.
When Johnel Sullivan was in Sydney he
made up his mind every morning that he was not
going to drink too much. So he would go to the
bar of the hotel where ho stayed and, taking up
the smallest glass lie could see on the counter,
would say to the barmaid: “Now, little gel,
you’ll ’ave to look after me to-day. This is my
glass, little gel.” And all through the day John
used to pour in to and out of that little glass the
contents of any number of fizz bottles. Thus doth
the strong man deceive himself.
Colonel Olcotb’s religion, new in theory,
seems quite old in practice, judging from a lady’s
letter to a friend in Sydney. The lady was a
fellow-passenger on the Massilia, in which tire
Blavatsky graduate took passage from these
shores : —“ The dear old man is gallant (spoken
with a Byronic curl of the lip); he used to squeeze
our hands in a decidedly non-paternal way ; in
fact, had we not known that he was Colonel
Olcott, of warranted idealistic aspirations, his
palming work would have made him answer to
our conception of the modest Turk.”
C. D. Keane, P.M. and Mining-Registrar,
who died the other day in a N.Q. Hospital, was
well-known on all the Australian goldfields.
Keane, a tall, soldierly man, when in Ireland
years ago took an active part in the old Fenian
movement, and spent many days and nights in
drilling rebels. Ho used to boast that he had
been 14 times in gaol in his native country, which
he left disgusted, and spent the remainder of his
life in studying for the Bar, fossicking for gold,
and administering justice in Australia.'
During the sitting of the Parnell Commis-
sion the Irish leader frequently came into Court
carrying a small black bag, which, in course of
time, came to be quite celebrated, and much won-
der was expressed as to the nature of its contents.
Despite Parnell’s vigilance and tenacity the bag
was lost one day, and it turned up at Scotland
Yard. It was there opened—possibly with some
trepidation, certainly with considerable curiosity
—and was found to contain a pair of woollen
socks, which the dreaded owner used to carry
about in case his'feet got wet.
The Due D’Orleans, hero of the Melba
scandal, is described as “tall, slender, and of
sallow complexion,” resembling his grand-sire, the
old Due D’Orleans. The present Orleans’father,
the Comte do Paris, once declined to dine with
the Prince of Wales. “It is difficult to imagine
the Comte in ouch a circle,” says Count Paul
Vasili in his “ Society in Paris” : “ The exquisite
correctness of his manners, his concern for
morality, the elevation of thought and propriety,
which latter feeling is to him as a second nature,
could not associate with it.” Now comes Tommy's
turn to chuckle over the morals of the Orleans’
family.

We hear much nowadays about Maple
the London millionaire furniture-man and race'
horse-owner. Many of the aristocracy are verv
shabby in appearance, but Maple, being a brand-
new aristocrat, lias a monkey-soap polish on him
all the tune, and is hall-marked 24 carat. It is
related by a London paper that he met, at the
Derby, the Marquis of Ailesbury (in a shabbv
coat and a bad hat) driving with a lot of frowsy
theatncal women in an old, omnibus-shaped
shandridan. Hello, Ailesbury,” cried Maple
where does that ’bus of yours run ?” “ Runs to

shop if you like,” replied Ailesbury.
After old Captain Moriarty (father of
Edward and Abraham of that ilk) had retired
from the office of Harbour-Master of Port Jack-
son, he sought Parliamentary honours, and was
elected for Braidwood. He brought to bear upon
Ins legislative duties the same Hibernian fire and
energy which characterised his harbour master-
ship. It happened that he was violently opposed
to some bill which had been introduced by Mr.
1 arkes, and both in and out of the House he was

scandalous piece of legislation which was ever
submitted to Parliament.” “So athrocious do I
consider it, Broadhurst,” he said, “ that rather
than see it pass, like Grattan, I’ll doy on theflnre
of the House.” “Bravo, old fellow,” said theQ.C.,
DuJce et decorum est pro patria mori- arty. ”
Our dear old friend General Mclver, the
rampant warrior who served “ under fourteen
flags,” turned up lately in New York, where he
told a solemn tale to, or wrote a tale for, a re-
porter, and the reporter put it in the paper.
Mclver, it seems, had drifted to Costa Rica,
where he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of
the army. _ He was also going to be Minister of
'v ar, and in course of time he would probably
have been the entire Cabinet and possibly several
dukes and the president as well, only the “native
aristocracy ” got up on its local black ear and
raised a row. A gigantic potentate named Cas-
tmez, who seems to have been eight feet high,
with double joints and a huge set of teeth, chal-
lenged Mclver to single combat, and they met in
a gory encounter with axes or something, and in
twenty seconds Castinez’s blood was spouting up
to the blue arch above. When he recovered he
came round by night with five savage homicides
all armed to the teeth, and raised Cain at the
General’s door. Then Mclver, by bis own account,
rushed forth and buried his shining blade in the
foremost brigand, and hove his mangled remains
at the heads of his accomplices. After this ex-
hibition the General fought the other five off and
on all through the night, killing three of them,
and badly discouraging another one, and in the
morning the street looked like a butcher’s em-
porium, and every house thereabouts was spattered
with brains. MTver resigned after this, receiving
a large sum of money and a sword of honour from
the grateful republic, and came to New York—to
write up the proceedings in the newspapers. This
is his own version of the case, and as The Bllle-
TIN never saw MTver howling on the bloodstained
field of battle, or charging in a hollow square with
the plunder in the centre, it takes the General at
his own valuation. The only time, in fact, that
this paper ever saw that hero in action was when
he was contending with an infant in a London
police-court. On that occasion the infant knocked
him out in one round, and lie had to pay ss. a
week.

In fact, the new organisation must of necessity be
a Freetrade and anii-Foderation League.
Why should not the Australias federate in
being represented at the Chicago World’s Fair?
The N.S.W. representation will cost ,£50,000 of
State money. And, just listen —the fair is to be
open on Sundays !
London Times put this headline to the
cable announcing the overthrow of the Parkes
Administration; “ Resignation of the Melbourne
Government.” Such are
the people whose opinions
are deferred to in Aus-
tralia !
Glassey, M. L. A.
(Q.), says that the bush
strikers now lying in St.
Helena Prison will be
liberated in spite of the
Government. G las soy
has his eye on a general
election, at which the
Labour-party hope to re-
turn 20 Labour members
at least.
Cunningham Gra-
ham, writing to Pall
Mall Gazette, says that
Labour will, in England,
as in other countries, be
little affected by pay-
ment of members. The
second ballot will be a
far more democratic
measure. But then Eng-
land needs both.
Before the century
closes, the U.S. national
debt will have been ex-
tinguished. In 1870 it
was 2,386,000,000 dol-
lars ; in 1890 it was
988,000,000 dollars. The
per capita debt of the
U.S. is less than that of
any other nation —2B
dollars. It is 218 dollars
in France, and 100 dol-
lars in Great Britain.
The Playford Go-
vernment’s taxation
policy has gone hope-
lessly wrong, as most
people anticipated.
It comprised what
Playford called “ four
steps,” each step being
worse than the one before. The whole business
was simply a bold but unsuccessful attempt on
the part of the Conservatives to dish the rising
S.A. Radical-party.
At one o’clock the other morning, just as
the tired politicians were thinking ot adjourning,
the big clock at Parliament House, Sydney,
struck 13. This is a solemn and dreadful portent.
It obviously means that it will be 13 years before
George Reid gets a show to be Premier of N.S.W.,
and when he does get a show he will be all at
sixes and sevens.
Theodore Unmack, Postmaster-General and
Minister for Railways (Q.), is to be credited with
possession of the courage of independent opinions.
He voted as a solitary Crown Minister against
the grant of £2OOO to Mrs. Macrossan, and the
.£2OOO to Mrs. Jordan. He voted with a small
minority of three or four on each occasion as a
protest on principle against improper grants
proposed and carried as a manifestation of a sen-
timentalism which won’t work all round.
A pleasant comment from the Canterbury
Times (M.L.)
The groat scheme by which Australians were to abandon
local jealousies, parish politics, intercolonial custom-
houses, and all the other objectionable things which the
world sees in Australia, has disappeared. The effort was
too great for enervated Australia. The Australians prefer
the fool’s paradise of borrowed money, with its scrambles
and its sham-patriotism and demoralisation. They have
no stomach for anything higher. Let them grovel!
In supporting the Government Railways
(Contracts) Amendment Bill, the second reading
of which was carried by 85 to 5, Mr. Carruthers,
M.P. (N.S.W.), said he would like to see the
principle which it embodied extended to appoint-
ments, “so that Australians might come first.’
Mr. Carruthers never was so patriotic when his
voice was potent in Government. It was chiefly
though not nominally for affirming too freely the
principle which he commends that a penniless
pressman was sent to gaol last year.
G.,H. Reid, criticising the composition of
the N.S.W. Protectionist Ministry, spoke of it as
“a Ministry of proselytes and not of apostles.”
None of the old warriors who had for so many
years fought for Protection were, he remarked,
included in the Government. “ They had been
crowded out by the proselytes.” And that was
what stung Reid. He remembered sp many of
the Government as brother Freetraders of his,
and yet he could not point to a single convert to
Protection on the Freetrade benches.
The members of S.A. Legislative Council
seem quite heedless of the approaching wrath of
the Democratic party. For three years the Assem-
bly carried by large majorities a Bill for municipal
rating on unimproved values, and the Council
threw it out each time. This year, for the fourth
time, the measure was brought forward, and,
owing (o the Labour-party, there was a majority.
The old fossils bided their time, however, and
when three of its supporters were absent somebody
moved the Chairman out, of the chair, and the
Bill was again wrecked.
The Bundaberg Star states in emphatic
terms that the female immigrants, who are im-
ported into Queensland at the expense of the tax-
payer, are the off-scourings of the gaols and work-
houses of England, and a curse to the province at
large. Speaking from its experience of those who
are supplied—under the designation of domestic
servants —to the unhappy town of Bundaberg, it

D AVID SYME (to his minion) : “Ah ! you are there, Mr. Dryvler ; be kind enough to let me have another
leading article on THE BULLETIN ridiculing the idea that anybody reads such a paper. Make it
'ot-'ot, do you lear, sir!"
denounces them as “morallepers,” and more than
hints that Queensland is only being taxed to im-
port a supply of fallen women, mostly in the sere
and yellow leaf, for its brothels and its gaols.
An argument for land nationalisation from'
a current issue of Lloyd’s Newspaper (London):
Hunts and Free Education.— John Bell, labourer, was
charged at Newcastle-on-Tyne, on Monday, with having
broken into a shop and stolen clothing to the value of £5.
Daring the case prisoner’s wife complained that her rent
had been raised. Police-superintendent Moss said since
the passing of the Free Education Bill rents had been in-
creased. Alderman Hamond ; Nonsense—is that so ?
Superintendent Moss: Yes: and the thing prevails all
over the place. In reply to Alderman Hamond, prisoner’s
wife said their children went to a Board school. Aider-
man Hamond: And the landlord charges you the fee you
used to pay for the children's education? Very nice,
indeed. Superintendent Moss: It is going on over the
whole district. Alderman Hamond: It is most extra-
ordinary. If the landlords had paid the school fees I
could have understood it. It is most iniquitous, and this
is legislation ! It is grandmotherly legislation. The
prisoner was remanded.
After this, should the State own the land ?
Parnell said that O'Kelly, the member for
Roscommon, was the only Irishman who could
keep a secret.
Whenever wo hear of David Syme’s
“ Modification of Organisms ” we think of how
artfully David modifies the organism of the Age
to suit his book.
During the period 1867 to 1886 the
number of divorces granted in the U.S. numbered
328,710. There are no less than 42 valid causes for
divorce, one of which, “rash and ungovernablo
temper,” obtains only in Florida. It is, however,
as good as any o'ther reason. The chief real
ground for divorce is, after all, “I do not like
you, Dr. Fell.” The law does not recognise this,
so people swear to all sorts of fairy tales, in order
to comply with the code’s exactions.
No valet is a hero to his master.

Night and Day, the organ of philanthro-
pist Barnardo, of London, sends us an urgent
appeal for subscriptions, and requests the helper
to state, when despatching the cash, whether his

donated to the good cause.
The real, unvarnished facts respecting the
faulty Baldwin engines last imported by the
N.S.W. Commissioners are stated to be as
follows. The engines are unwieldy, and of too
heavy a calibre for the rails, and, notwithstanding
semi-official explanations in the press, are im-
practicable for the swift-running express service.
The order sent was for “ twelve of the type used
on the Baltimore and Ohio railway, but lighter.”
It was the ambiguity of the order, and the absence
of a proper specification, that caused the “muss.”
The order was sent during the absence from the
country of Mr. Thow, who has an invincible
hatred of everything American, and there is sure
to be a nasty complication of engineering talent
when he returns.
The Y. M. C. A. saints have decided to hold a
week of devotion, of which somebody has sent us
the bill: —
1. Preparation for the week of prayer by public
or private meetings ; 2, humiliation and cleansing;
3, the inner life of the associations ; 4, outward activity ;
5, prayer for young men of different social conditions ; 6,
prayer for the committees of the associations; and 7,
prayer for associations suffering from weakness, exposed
to temptation, or isolated, for those in heathen countries,
and for others.
We love these old, unctuous, cant phrases. We
love the humiliation and the cleansing, and the
“ inner life of the associations,” and all the rest of
i the wheezes. There is a pious oiliness about them
which we would miss dreadfully if it were
abolished. We like to hear of the “ outpourings ”
and the “sanctification” and the “blessings”
, and the collection, and the rest of the 700
words or so which make up the entire pulpit
vocabulary of the period. The modern preacher
never talks of cleaning— he always says
“cleansing.'’ He never gets a thing—
it has always been vouchsafed to him; and he
meditates instead of thinking, and goes in heavily
for “humiliation.” But all the same the
Y.M.O.A. doesn’t mean anything. For if it did,
instead of praying for “outward activity” or
things like that it would get down to facts, and
ask to be delivered from hypocrites and snuffle-
busters ; it would pray that the choir-girl and the
.office cash might not go astray so frequently; and
that the old church member might not miscon-
duct himself so often by pursuing small girls.
But no Y.M.O.A. ever does pray for these things;
it keeps on in the old groove asking for “ humilia-
tion ” and “inner life” and ’ “ outward activity,”
and similar muddy old gags all the time.
An all-round swindle is frequently
squared.
Dear Bulletin, —Poor old John Outram
Wascoe—nephew of the distinguished General
Outram—who kept the “Pilgrim’s Inn” on the
Blue Mountains 25 years ago, and who afterwards
obtained a billet in the N.S.W. Government
stores, through the influence of the late Sir
James Martin, came to Wattle Plat two years ago
to be, as he said, “buried alongside of his second
wife,’’ in the R.C. burying-ground. After all, the
dead man’s wishes were not respected, for he was
laid to rest by his friends and heirs in the C.E.
grounds.—Yours truly, S.E.
A certain Queensland Crown Minister was
standing unsteadily in the lobby the other even-
ing when his chief, Sir Samuel, came along. “Do
you know, Mr. , that your estimates come on
this evening?” “Yes, Sir Samuel, I will be
there.” “ Well, had you not better get in then?”
“ When the time comes I will be just as ready as
you are ; and if you think I will not, then accept
my resignation as a Minister of the Crown at
once ?” This flabbergasted Griffith, and later
on in the evening the—hie—Minister put his
“estimates ” through in record time.
The Yictorian rifle-clubs have decided, by
a large majority, not to enforce the wearing of
uniforms, on the ground that such a rule would
cause a large falling off in membership. A gleam
of sunshine breaks through the dark cloud of
militarism which has long been gathering over
the land of “Lay’em out.” The amateur dash-
ing militaire appears to be satisfied with a license
to carry a rifle, and doesn’t pant to doll himself
up in the trappings of war for the sole purpose of
mashing poor young Mary Ann. Meanwhile the
blessed Majah General groans over the indignity
of having to inspect a lot of fellahs who look like
beastly civilians, bai jove ! and he gets up in the
middle of the night to snort at the monstrous
supposition that any man can defend his native
shores in a sac suit. It is ridiculous. The
Bulletin thinks that every adult Australian
should pass his days in tin armour, waiting for
the far-off foe, whilst the women and children
develope the resources of the country and vote
a yearly increase on the Commandant’s salary.
An “ up-country visitor” to Melbourne
complains that the police authorities have
neglected to adopt a thief-catching invention
which he brought under their notice three years
ago. The idea of this bucolic genius is distinctly
Jin de siecle and to the point. He proposes that a
number of detectives, disguised as unsuspecting
graziers, or artless maidens from the bush (the
average D. being constructed on graceful, feminine
lines, seemingly) shall take up commanding posi-
tions on the Block, or scatter themselves among
crowds at agricultural shows, &c., armed" with
aggressive outside pockets calculated to attract
the malefaeting eye. Said pockets are to be
bordered round with strong elastic bands
and fish-hooks, so that the insinuating paw
of the larcenist will remain firmly secured to
the pocket until his yells of anguish arouse the
active and intelligent copper from his normal con-
dition of stupor, whereupon he will turn round
and arrest his bleeding hanger-on in the Queen's
name. This up-country person’s proposal strikes
one as likely to fill a long-felt want, and why
Commissioner Chomley doesn’t dress up a detach-
ment of blue-chinned myrmidons in skirts and
parasols, and set them angling for pickpockets in
public places, is another of those police mysteries
which time alone can unravel. The inventor’s
real name ought to be Hookey Walker.
An old Scotchman is said to have risen in
prayer-meeting one night and, apropos of nothing,
delivered himself of the following remarks ;
“There are three things I never could quite
understand. First, why boys will throw sticks at
green apples when, if they waited, the apples
would ripen and drop off; secondly, I never
could quite comprehend why men go to war to
kill each other when, if they remained quietly at
home they would die a natural death in good
time; thirdly, and most important of all, Ido
not see why the men chase around after the
women, since, if they sat still, the women would
run round after them.” How true that death
comes to all men, to some so prematurely, who
neglect the warning symptoms of approaching
disease, such as a tired aching feeling in the
morning, headaches and nervousness, sour taste
in the mouth, &c., all these are signs that the
physical body is deranged and that if treated
lightly, serious danger is to be apprehended. W.
Swanson, Esq., 70 King William-street, Fitzroy,
Melbourne, says : About three years ago I was
seized all of a sudden with great lassitude, dizzi-
ness and extreme nervousness so great that I was
unable to rally after any effort. My digestive
organs were so impaired and my liver so con-
gested that I was scarcely able to eat any solid
food, and gradually became so weak that I could
barely drag myself along. After using a number
of doctors’ medicines and advertised remedies to
no purpose, I started on a course of Clements
Tonic which brought me groat relief, especially
when using Dr. Fletcher’s Pills as well. Then I
gained weight and strength quickly. I took
altogether 12 bottles of Clements Tonic and four
boxes of Fletcher’s Pills, and my health and vigor
increased under their healthful stimulus.” Miss
Amelia Mensh, 471 King-street, Melbourne,
writes: “I have suffered most acutely from
neuralgia, so muck that my face often swelled
great and caused me much agony. I can truly
say that Clements Tonic gave me prompt and
very great relief.” Head-office and laboratories,

A sinecural servant of the N.S.W. Govern-
ment figured as the slave of sleep at last Mel-
bourne Cup. Shortly after the first race he
wedged himself into a corner of the stand, and,
placing his large and tender hand upon his un-
troubled brow, fell sound asleep. The mad excite-
ment of the Cup rose like a tempest, raged,
and died away. But the unconscious official
functionary heard it not, nor did he stir until the
pangs of hunger warned him that dinner time was
drawing nigh.

Thus the “funny ” man of Sydney Echo :
“Dismal Jimmy” has begun again!
How anyone connected with the “establishment’ }
dare refer in such flippant terms to “ Mr. James’ 5
resumption of his arduous duties at the S.M.
Herald office is unexplainable, even on the
grounds of “ wit without coarseness.” Notwith-
standing all the latitude allowed to the Court
fool in the olden times, that privileged functionary
would have got a week’s notice for whacking the
King over the head with a bladder. Perhaps,’
after all, the Echo driveller meant somebody else.
# # *
Everyone knows what a solemn lot the
S.M. Herald authorities are. Well, the other
day, after prayer and lemonade at the “ welcome
home ” to “ Mister James,” the head of the house
of Fairfax, at Sydney Y.M.C.A. Hall, a rascal of
a compositor stood up and calmly sang a comic
song. And what do you think it was all about ?
It was about the girl whom he married and who
presented him with twins. What a lark that
song must have been ! It must have been like going
into the chief fane of Buddha with your boots on
and dancing a sand-jig.

A crank who is occasionally sent to the
lunatic asylum is kept in the Civil Service of an
Australian province through influence. To narrate
the origin of the influence is to relate the story of
a man’s undying love. Thirty years ago the
crank’s sister was deeply loved by a young man
who has since risen to fame. His suit was re-
jected, and in his disappointment he voyaged
abroad, and of course married the first pretty girl
he met. But his first love endureth for ever, and
thus it comes that the astute and inflexible poli-
tician champions the cranky civil servant, who is
privileged to tell his department superior, in the
presence of the whole office, to “go to the devil.”

After reading the N.S.W. divorce-reports

The joke of the year is the Sydney Daily
Telegraph’s account, in Saturday-week’s issue,
of a certain Arcadian marriage which, it says,
took place under a tree in Middle Harbour. The
report needs to be read slowly and carefully and
not out loud —if any ladies who understand Eng-
lish happen to be around.

The (now impending) failure of a Sydney
land-dealing company will presently inflict great
misery on many hundreds of small buyers, who,
as they bought land already mortgaged by the
vendors, will be unable to get their deeds. A man
we know submitted to Treasurer M’Millan, in
1889, a memo, of the doings of the principals of
the institution referred t -1 , and suggested a draft
of a clause. Had the hint been acted upon, the
fellow who will presently be execrated by a legion
of poor people as a robber, could only have
defrauded a few persons.

An apparently bad case of plagiarism is
now exciting attention. It is alleged that an
article sent in to a certain Sydney weekly by a
contributor was rejected but was subsequently
utilised by a lady connected with the journal,
who sent it as her own to England, where it
appeared. When the paper containing it reached
Australia trouble began.

When The Bulletin starts a daily paper
in Sydney, it will post its reporter on the steps of
the Divorce-court at daybreak, awaiting the open-
ing of the door. As things stand at present,
“select” cases are often heard as early as a
quarter-past nine.
At a recent Australian wedding where the
Governor was present, the p:octodings were
nearly blocked in the final act by the non-arrival
of the best man. This position was to be filled
by a small sized “Majah’’ who had incautiously
attended a party on the previous evening and
devoted the next day to solid repose. As the time
of 11ie ceremony drew near, and the Majah was
nowhere visible on the edge of the horizon, some
one suggested that the post be filled by the
Governor’s aide-de-camp, but just as that im-
portant person had fixed in position and straight-
ened his pants at the knees, the “Majah” came
tearing down the aisle wearing the costume ho
had slept in that day, and an expression of in-
dignation and undigested champagne and unsatis-
fied thirst for human blood. Chaos was only
narrowly averted by skilled diplomatists, and
when it was all over the party started for the
wedding feast and the bridegroom carved the cake
with his sword.

A well-known Australian Judge, whose
lips are always silently adding up, subtracting,
and finding the remainder, as ho threads his way
through the busy mart for the purpose of floating
a new loan —with which to pay the interest on the
previous one—stuck up a wealthy resident of a
marine suburb, ouo Sunday morning, and begged
for £5O. Strangely enough, the retired capitalist
knew not that his Honor was the gaunt genius of
hopeless impecuniosity and famine, and let him
have it. Mentioning the transaction to the local
butcher he was horrified to realise that the debt
was about as good as a Liberian debenture, A
month after the Judge again came, and with pro-
fuse apologies attempted to tap his simplicity for

Games of all kinds are strictly forbidden
within the walls of Darlinghurst Prison, the
reasonable theory being that not only would such
indulgences help to deprive prison of its proper
terrors, but that they would lead to gambling,
“battle, murder, and sudden death.” Neverthe-
less, the prohibition is regularly evaded, in most
instances with the connivance of the warders. In
No. 4 yard, which contains the cream of the
burgling profession, the quantity of tobacco staked
on eacli racing-event would astonish the Comp-
troller. The Chosen people here, as outside, run
their totes, consultations, and sweeps, and the
accuracy of their knowledge with respect to
fixtures, favourites, and the state of the
betting-market would be marvellous if their
envied privileges were not known to be so
utterly utter. Draughts arc successfully nego-
tiated with black and white buttons on a slate
marked off into 01 squaws, and chess is pflayed
with even greater facility, inasmuch as_ no
“pieces” are required; letters denoting king,
queen, bishop, knight, and castle, strokes and
circles the prawns, whilst moves areeffected simply
enough by rubbing out one letter and substituting
another. This is essentially the diversion of the
sedate lifer and the suave defaulter. More than
one prisoner has done his seven days’ cells for

Photographed appearances are deceiving.
A certain noble Britisher, not peer enough to
catch tin Australian heiress, and consequently too
blue-blooded to see anything jn_4-lio doosid colo-
nials, fell in love with a countrywoman on seeing
her photograph in the album of a fellow-exile, who
was the lady’s brother. He confessed his pflight
to the brother, who good-naturedly arranged that
the p)arties should correspond. All went well.
The lovers, between whom the whole earth inter-
posed itself, cooed to each other on paper and
fixed the happy day. The expectant bridegroom
paid her passage out, but, all, sad fate ! his prize
appeared in the flesh, little better than a museum
specimen with red, tow hair and a devilish squint.
Result: Refused to marry her, and had to piawn
his immortal soul so as to get the cash to pro-
pitiate the incensed brother and the outraged
maiden.

If people get to know how to remove bloodstains
then what is to become of the unfathomable detec-

goes around with a dark lantern at midnight and
finds the red blotch on the floor of the ruined
house, by which he instantly spots the duke who
assassinated the girl with the soft brown eye and
threw her remains into the tank? Then how is
the duke to take Rough on Rats and die in agony
on the mat at the foot of the stairs, after writing
a confession which is afterwards discovered hidden
in a box, in a hole under a withered tree with one
bough standing up and pointing to the moon? And
after that, ho v is the girl with the soft brown eye
to come to life again and forgive him, and spend
all the rest of her life in works of benevolence;
and lib'w is the spectre to come and sit on the
bloodstain in the dark, and chatter, and shake its
bones at the stars ? And if these things are
abolished, how is the evening paper to have a tale
of any kind?

She stood with her face upturned to mine
(Twas a childlike face and rare),
As the day went down and the aftershine
With a glory tinged her hair ;
And a red glow dipped on the far skyline,
As we stood and watched it there.
Dim night on the earth spread wide her pall,
And my hot lips pressed her hair.
As it swept unbound in its rippling fall
To her neck, round, white, and hare ;
And a low wind sang in the branches tall,
“ She is thine for e’er and e’er !”
Sweet hours of the night on swift wings flew,
Ami my soul hurst forth unbound ;
For her lips were red, and her eyes were blue,
And her arms entwined mo round,
And her kiss was balm, and her breath was dew,
And the dim world swooned and drowned.
Close, close to my breast her white cheek pressed
And tier bosom swayed with sighs,
As a faint light waned in the far-off west,
Anil a cloud mass skimmed the skies,
And her head lay hack in my arms at rest,
And I kissed her half-veiled eyes.
Close clasped to my heart I held her fast,
With a fierce, wild love new-born,
And I cried, “ at last!”
. . . . And the wind swept past
With a moan and a cry forlorn,
And a harsh voice mocked, “at last! at last!”
And my love from my arms was torn.

Professor Morris, to whom Australasia is
chiefly indebted for its blessed Charity Organisa-
tion, got on to the old, old story again at last
week’s conference. His speech was not intended
for the apostles of charity there present, because
they were all delegates (or Lord Hopetoun), and
already knew that God doesn’t love the cheerful
giver unless ho makes enquiries which usually
result in nothing being given. Professor M. was
evidently addressing the ignorant, unorganised
outsiders when ho said : “ They must be careful
not to sap independence, and to remember that
pauperisation was worse than poverty. Out-
door relief should be given with discre-
tion, and constant and continuous doles avoided.”
He didn’t advise large lump sums instead of
“doles,” nor, in fact, did the Professor recom-
mend anything special in the way of charity
except “ a largo central office where the charitable
institutions could have their offices.” And where,
we presume, the associated assisters of the poor
and needy could refer each applicant from
office to office until he came gasping back to
the first office and was told to wait until the
secretary returned from a month’s holiday. Let
us avoid the giving of doles, anyway, because it
comes less expensive to the capitalist, and can t be
worse for Lazarus. Makes him more doleful than
ever, donchersee —

Some low character writes in the Edin-

Australian girls are not a success.—
I have seen much of married life, both at home and
abroad in New South Wales, and still I am not married. I
nave been looking for a wife years back, and am no
lurtner forward. The colonial young ladies would be the
last tor me or any man to marry, as they are all very fast-
gomg. Give them dress, drink, and company, and down

ALL THE DIFFERENCE.
WIFE: “ John, it makes me so miserable to see you drinking like that.”
HUSBAND: “Nonsensh, my dear; you’re out of spirtsh.”
WIFE (solemnly) : “Ah, John, I wish you were out of spirits.”
worst. The poor husbands toil away under a heat of from
90 to 100 degrees, and the women leave their house to
take care of itself. I know a man who would not have an
Australian wife, and who came homo and got one and
went back. That is just what I would have done if I had
intended going hack. You may get one that Is brought
up in the country that will make a very good wife, hut it
is very hard to come across them.
We know- exactly the sort of wife that complainant
wants. She is a haggard female with a fresh baby
every year. When she goes out she is always
humping one infant and hauling six more, and
she is consumed with anxiety lest the five she has
left at home are eating tin-tacks and trying to
boil the kitten. She has the rheumatism in both
her copious knees through scrubbing the attics
and stairs, and she does all her own washing.
Generally she rises at 5 a.m., and she seems
to be scouring infants with monkey soap right
on till 11 p.m., after which she has all the rest
of the time to herself. When she is dressed
she looks as if her clothes had been shot at her
out of a gun, and her boots are large and loose
and cheap and shapeless. In most cases she dies
of old age at 50, and is glad to do it, for she never
had a rest in all her .toilsome existence before.

One of Sydney D.T.’s correspondents
writes thus on the marriage question :
Many a single woman designated “old maid” walks
alone—not because she could not marry, but because she
is true and faithful to the memory of one.
We know this type of “old maid,” with her time-
worn story of how she could, but she wouldn’t.
The steadfastness with which widows invariably
remain true to the memory of the dead Adolphus
whom they planted in the (sob) spring, casts a
lurid light on the constancy of the spinster to the
memory of the angel whom she never quite
caught.

Which, from the lips of a man whom he had fee’d
handsomely, must have been very pleasing to Mr.
Tyson. And then the Salomons proceeded to do
one of those many things ” which lawyers do as
counsel, thus :
Mr. Justice Innes : “ Marriage or no marriage, there is
no suggestion that she was ever unfaithful (o him.”
Dr. Sly said that the other side admitted that.
Sir Julian Salomons : “We admit it. At any rate, we
have no evidence of it.”

Rev. Chas. Duppuy, ivho recently died,
was the clergyman who conducted with such per-

calculable good in educating the Australian public
to a perception of the great truth that a reredos
is not an ibis, nor a dado, but simply a marble
blister, the contemplation of which is conducive
to devotion, just as gazing at a coin in the palm
of your hand helps towards hypnotism. Mr.
Duppuy’s widow and family are 'in destitute cir-

The skipper whoso practice of medicine
consists of treating his crew with emetics for
maladies above the belt, and purgatives for those
below, although a crude one, is more sensible than
that of the many who fly to pills and purgatives
for every ill. But in a relaxing climate like this
the use of a wholesome, bracing preparation like
Marshall’s Tonic Nervine is a far more rational
line of treatment, especially for cases where it is
not deemed necessary to call the doctor in.
M. De Blowitz writes of “Germany,
France, and General European Politics.” His
prediction is that there will be no general war just
yet. The balance of parties, the dread of im-
perialism, must keep France from taking the
initiative. Italy is too weak, Russia too much
burdened with debt, famine, and Nihilism to
begin. Germany has nothing to gain by it. But
when the Emperor of Austria dies, Germany,
Russia, and Italy will simultaneously reach for
portions of his heterogeneous empire, and the vast
military establishments which now oppress Europe
will accomplish their destiny.
Rudyard Kipling, the impudent Indian
storyteller who landed in Australia on a Monday
and left the following Thursday, and who in
the meantime contrived to tell a hew nation that
;t was perfunctory and idiotic and playing at
legislation, is a result of the blind trust placed by
the conservative sections of this community in the
opinions of any commonplace person hailing from
King land. It has been the custom to consider
that the visitor who is able to write stories is per-
fectly at homo on legislation and metallurgy
much in the same way as a blacksmith would be
supposed to have an illicit intimacy with
astronomy. If Gladstone should come here and
remark that our Governmental administration was
corruption, the fact of the speaker being Gladstone
would gi ve sufficient colour to render investigation
advisable. But we would not take Gladstone’s
opinions on the idiotic heroism of the British
soldier and the effect of Indian stories on the
morality of the world any more than we would
trust Kipling to describe us. There is absolutely
but one thing in this country whose efficacy as a
curative all Australians are able to endorse. The
Bethel Electric Medical Baths Co., of Lonsdale-
street, Melbourne, have during the last six months

functions can, by using Bethel’s patents, compass
a certain cure at a moderate cost. There is but
one Electric Curative method in Australia, and so
all sufferers wishing relief must journey to Lons-
dale-street, Melbourne, and the writer of this is

We did not know our duty when
With baccy we were spoiling,
From time to time, some aged men,
Who haven’t strength for toiling ;
We fear their weak, immortal souls
Were ruined by those “constant doles.”

When scattered in the battered hat
Of one whose case is blindness ;
We will not heed his bitter cry
For fear it may he all my eye.

No starving wretch shall prick it—

Unless he bring a ticket

To any beggar living,

And offices, and clerks galore,
And secretaries polished,
AVho’ll “ look into the matter more,”
Till poverty’s abolished,
And all the folks we haven’t fed
Are doing well at being dead.

There were six of us camping on Kangaroo Creek—
No, stop ! there were seven, including the boss—
We had been there a day or two over a week,
But the creek we had not yet been able to cross.
We had surveyed two blocks for old Joshua Hyde,
The boundaries all had been carefully “run,”
But we wished to “ connect” to the opposite side,
’Twas dangerous work, hut it had to he done.
We finished the breakfast old Pat had prepared,
(Well, as for the curry, we finished the lot),
Made straight for the-creek, for the boss had declared,
He d tackle the water—a “ hanker ”or not.
When arrived at the hank, it was just as we thought,
The waters were roaring and tearing apace ;
While every current fresh obstacles brought—
A whirling of debris—a caution to face.
For a moment or two we stood still on the brink,
No eagerness any displayed for the trip,
Till Patsy volunteer’d with a hearty, “ 1 think,
I’ll try it, and chance it-hcre goes for a strip.”
He was stripp’d in a moment, and taking the chain
He started those turbulent rapids to breast,
With a joking, “ Perhaps I shan’t see you again ”
Oh ! “ many’s the truth that is uttered in jest!”
Then in silence we cazed on this gallant display
Of presence of mind in a ciitical case,
While he battl’d and struggled and fought on his way
As the waters rushed on in a hurricane race.
And now he is close to the opposite land—
The current seems less on the furthermost side—
When, without any warning, he throws up his hand,
“God help me !” his cry—and he sinks ’neath the tide
We did what we could—hut ah ! never again,
Would Patsy’s gay laugh echo in with the rest—
No more would be ready in trouble or pain
To turn both aside with a smile or a jest.
So, sadly we placed him to rest ’neath the shade
Of a willow that wept in its silence alone :
On a cross of red cedar, these letters we made—
“ Died bravely in harness-Wild Patsy Malone.”

CORRESPONDENCE
“ H.J.K.” : Don’t remember receiving anything
In your handwriting—“ A.C.F.” (Lane C.): Is it abso-
lutely original ?,...“ The Larrikin”: We don t give
“ turns” to gentlemen who have a plurality of wives....
“Jim Byrnes”: Thanks. We are obliged for your
criticism “P.H.” (York): Purely local. Send us
something of all-round interest.. “Jarrobp”; If you
will read an article entitled “Things will last my time,
and published in Tnr. Bulletin of 31st May, 1890, you
will find all your arguments, and a good many more. It
is unkind to dish up cur own brains and send them to
us, though it still affords us a certain amount of pleasure
to see the old screed turning up again.... “ Kangaroo :
We are very pious, and your poetry is horribly
heterodox “ Pontifex Maximus ”: We got your poem,
for which the W.P.B. yawned, and not in vain....
“ Yendys” : Good verse in a way, but spoilt by too much
cant-democratic phrase —allusions to the “ tyrant’s heel,
and old sayings like that. Moreover, to run in the
tyrant’s heel apropos of Wales is absurd ; you can’t make
a tyrant out of baldness, baccarat-counlers, and jelly.. .
“D. O’R.” You must be the great original Jabberwock,
judging by your verses....“ Bertie Cecil” (Yass); A
rather pretty love-song, but, excepting works of absolute
genius, we don’t care over-much about love-songs. If
you ever offered cold tea to an alligator you will under-
stand what we mean “Thiggum Thu”: We have
always said 50.... “ A Haas ” : You should be arrested on
suspicion for writing a thing like this :
“ I rise to go, I leave my seat, it is the 14th day of May,
Instead of travelling towards my home I am going the
other way.”
If you do things like that often you will be sentenced some
day to be chained up and read to death by wild poets....
“To Hoa ArohaTawhi” : Thanks “Chain Lightning :
Rhymeless and rhythmless. Must decline....“ A Con-
stant Reader”: We have a score of limes during our
press career seen evidence in courts of law of the noxious
influence of secret societies, which are the enemies of
justice... “ Sans Souci ”: Thanks for letter....“ Childe
Harold”: On 28th November, 1889, we believe....“ Gee-
bun"-” (Lismore) : If you will write to the Insurance and |
Banking Record, Melbourne, they can doubtless answer
your first question. We know of no books at all dealing
with the second matter you mention— “40 Years
Temp.”: Too pious to be honest “A.M.J.”: We dint
value stories of heroism narrated by the heroes them-
selves. The “ hero ’ who tells his own story “ modestly ’
is the worst fraud of all. The most artful waj r to tell a
story attributing heroism to yourself is to tell it
“ modestlv ”... “ Bris ” : Some of the most pleasant
people ever imported to Queensland as immigrants were
Scandinavians....“ H.J.K.” (H.): Glad to have them if
well-condensed “Coventry": An interesting item
which should surely offend no one...“ Allan F. W.’’:
Thanks. Have already seen it. To remark upon the
opinion would apparently smack of jealousy, so we
refrain “Trespass”: Hicks had married the girl, and
her evidence couldn’t have been taken against him. The
N.S. Wales Attorney-General no doubt merely asked
himself the question- can this prisoner be convicted in
the absence of the chief witness? “Her Min”: Ideas
excellent, but d.awing below par “Argonaut” (Mul.,
Q.); Thanks. Mr. Thompson, bookseller, of Queen-street,
Brisbane, will supply you. ..“M.L.”; We never allow
anybody to speak in our columns about “your ably-
conducted paper.” Every paper is “ ably-conducted”....
“The Pests of. Society ” : We read your book, and con-
fined our notice to the cover in order to let you down
easily. If you really want a more definite opinion, we
regard it: s a loathsome, beastly, and hopelessly nasty
publication written from pure love of nastiness, and con-
sider that the Board of Health should get on its track.
The jokes are mostly cribbed from old Bulletins, but the
nastiness is altogetheroriginal—“G.H.”(Cootamundra):
The shortest route is over the Union Pacific Railway, via
Salt Lake City... “ E.F.S.” (St. Kilda): The X’mas poem
is too awfully pious. We are the sons of the original
Scrooge, and we loathe carols and X’mas hymns, and the
sodden plum pudding that makes you feel as if you had
eaten an anchor, and the rest of the alleged mirtb....
“ Curiosity "(Goondiwindi, Q.) and others: Due announce-
ment will be made as to the publication of Frank the
Poet’s “ Tour through Hell.” With reference to the
“ Convicts’ Oath,” so many applications have been made
for copies that “ Price Waning” has concluded that the
best way of answering them is to refuse them all.
At the same time, if you are particularly anxious
for a copy of that production, and care to send five
shillings to the “Accountant,” Bulletin office, a copy
will be sent you, and the five shillings will be handed to
the Children’s Hospital. The “Oath,” according to con-
victs’ tradition, was composed by a talented and scoun-
drelly solicitor who was transported in 1827 or 1828. His
descendants are occupying honorable positions, and,
therefore, the alleged authorship will not be communi-
cated . “Rov”(Tas.); No fear. We don’t print such things
“E. G. ‘Williams” (Nimitybelle): Your communica-
tion attended to. Thanks.... “ R.P.T." (Ophir); Musings
over the dead, complicated with hazy howls of sympathy,
and a wild desire to know what he died of, are not neces-
sarily poetry ... “ J.A.S.” (South Yarra); It reads so like
a sermon of the most aggravated type that we instinc-
tively got out a threepenny to be ready for the collection.
Then we went to sleep. ..“L.W.M.” (Annandale) : Very
melancholy verse. Besides, what’s the good of throwing
such very strong language at such a very weak individual?
“ H.H.” (Orbost) : There isn’t enough land for such a
scheme to work. You would want anew earth if you are
going to lend out the soil in such lavish slabs as all that.
....“Australian”: You are an incomprehensible man.
Why do you want the Government to issue notes
“to the value of the national estate?” The country
only wants a certain amount of money as a trad-
ing medium, and you would furnish fifty times
more than is wanted “M.A.” (Brisbane): Good
parody,, but even a good parody is a woefully bad
thing “J. M. Palles ”; A most inconclusive story,
the Skeleton of which is to be found in one of Charles
Delavigne’s works. If he was like the historical Mayor of
Galway he calmly hanged his own son “L. 0.”: The
Sydney tailors need not for an instant imagine that they
can fight the masters. They are fighting the Employers’
Union, which is prepared to uphold the grossest forms of
sweating under the name of “freedom of contract”....
“D.W" (Waverley); A cheap advt “M.W.” (Tam-
worth): He only takes tw0....“8i11y-can ” (Arncliffe):
Received with thanks....“ Adam Bert” (Aramac): We
can quite believe that they have “ never been offered to
any other paper.” Anyhow, they weren’t offered per-
sonally. If they had been you wouldn’t have got away
alive ...“ A New Chum " (Adelaide): The A.N.A. is only
a huge joke. A crowd of men who must needs whoop
and give three cheers to celebrate the fact that they
were born in their own country are too horrible. How
would an English Natives’ Association go in London ?

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Mullagh, the celebrated aboriginal
cricketer, spoke English, as we have said, without the
slightest trace of the “ blacks’” accent. On one occasion
when the aboriijinal team played a match on the old
Albert Ground, Sydney, between the innings the darkies
were much lionized. T. C. Jamison, a well-known Sydney
character, a locker or something in the Customs, went up
to Mullagh and addressed him in the supposed native
lingo. “How you bin likit gricket, Mullagh?” said he ;
“you likum blay longa white fellow?” “I beg your
pardon, sir,” quoth Johnny, “I don’t understand what
you say ; I speak English.”
f * *
Joe Thompson, writes our correspondent, must
have won an enormous sum of money over the
Caisarewitch. He made his book for Alec. Taylor’s stable
—it is said for Harfieur, but no doubt the wily Joseph
knew all about Ragimunde. There is some mystery about
the running of this horse, whicli only a fortnight ago
could only beat a commoner like Sheldrake at New-
market after a dead heat. In the big handicap he
won all the way. Such a reversal of form would
certainly lead to enquiries if the horse belonged to any
one but a swell like the Duke of Beaufort. In addition
to his direct winnings Joe must have cleared the whole of
his enormous double-event book. Joe is fairly at the top
of the tree as a fielder. He is known now at the clubs as
“the Leviathan,”of which he is very proud.
# * *
O’Connor and Hanlan seem to have beaten
Dutch, of the Parramatta, and Stephenson, of Maoriland,
very badly in the three mile-sculling race on Fraser
River, British Columbia. There’s a good deal in the
‘ my foot is on my native heath ” feeling.
* * m
The usual prosecution of unregistered book-
makers attending Melbourne Cup eventuated at the
local Court the other day when about a dozen sweep and
game men were fined or sent to gaol. The prosecution in
the case of one Hyands was based on the fact that
defendant had been given into the custody of the police
by “ some man who had betted on a card game and lost.”
Nqw, The Bulletin would like to know what would have
happened if Hyands had lost the bet and given the “ some
man ” in charge for playing an unlawful game ?
• # *
That mysterious “ Englishman named Wells,”
who is perpetually winning fortunes at Monte Carlo looks,
at this distance, uncommonly like a myth, with a
“system” of bringing “visitors flocking from all parts to
the tables.” Probably the cablecrammer has muddled up
the real facts of the case. Some of our old nobility are
having little runs of luck, perhaps, and the croupiers
utter maledictions on “the Ingleesh swells.” Where-
upon, an addle-pated British newspaper correspondent
wires, “Englishman Wells Twenty-'thousand” (meaning
francs), the London dailies “expand” their intelligence
in tlie usual way, and the Australian cablecrammer lays
hold of it and adds the romantic supposition that Wells
started operations with a £5 note.
* * *
Melbourne Cup of ’9l is now ancient history,
but in the agony column of the Victorian papers there
still appears the customary pathetic notice praying that
the individual wearing a tall hat who held the £2
sweep will please write at once to X.YZ. and oblige.
This sort of advt. appears after every Cup, but nothing
is ever gained thereby save by the newspapers. Any-
body who puts up money in a sween with a party in a
bell-topper and glaring check raiment should get that
stakeholder down and stand on him till the race is over, or
else he should padlock him up to the fence. Or he might
lock him up in a room somewhere, and confiscate = his
clothes as security, and then leave the naked stakeholder
to sit on the money till settling time. And now that we
come to think of it, bookmakers should also be naked—
their clothes being deposited with the committee-and
they should bet through a pigeon-hole. Then, if they
bolted, the law could get at them and yet not recognise
betting. They would simply be arrested for undue want
of bathing costume.

Dear Bulletin,—ln correction of a last week’s
correction. Joe Thompson was not on board the City of
Melbourne during her equinoctial voyage of ’76 ; he re-
mained behind, with his brother “ books,” for the Sydney
Turf Club meeting, held one week after the night
the steamship sailed. Joe, however (an old shell-
back, by the way), was first man on board on our arrival
in smooth water. I was on board, and so was Mrs. Jack
Thompson and baby—number one, I believe. I still
remember the big tears welling up out of the
warm-hearted, burly “ booky’s ” eyes as he (Jack) folded
mother and child in one embrace. I have reason
to remember the circumstances of- the trip, for
returning to Sydney perforce, I waited to go in the
Alexandra, s.s., and backed Planet and Hotspur for
Hurdle and Steeple, at the S.T.C Meeting, at 20 to 1.
Corrigan’s mount won by a head from Glenister's grey
horse, named Grey something or other, and Hotspur,
with over 12 stone on his back, starting at 6 to 4, was
odds on when Nonsense, the late Mr. Bowes’ horse, with
the late George Mason up, I think, fell. It was’ odds
then on Hotspur, and I could have stood to win a big sum
one way and a fair sura the other for a brief space, but
there was nothing to make running, and Harding’s
Fearnaught, taking the fences at leisure, won easily from
the weight-crushed Hotspur. I might also tell you how
I paid a well-known Victorian steeplechaser 6s. as my share
of a bag of oysters on the final return trip, and had two
of the “delicious bivalves” for my money.—Yours
Friday.

Palo Alto has equalled Maud S.’s mile in 2.8|,
so says the cable. Maud S. made her record on July 30,
1885, when eleven years old, and for six years - has she
held the record. Palo Alto is by Electioneer, and is now
nine years old. Senator Stanford, his owner, said that
for years his stud-groom wanted to call every likely colt
after the name of his estate and breeding-farm, Palo Alto,
but Mr. Stanford insisted on having a say in the matter,
and when he named the horse under notice events now
show that he picked the correct animal to perpetuate the
name of Palo Alto in sporting circles. In 1887 and 1888
the horse was retired from the track and did stud duty,
but in 1889 he was again brought out, and the following
list of Ifs pci formances in ISS9 arid 1890 will show" that he
was gradually working up to his cabled grea t performance:

The so-called amateur English cricketer is in-
comparably better paid under the heading ®f expenses
than tlie common pro. In English matches where a
gentleman receives £25 for expenses, the pro. gets a
simple fiver. That’s all the difference between an English
amateur and a professional. The one is a gentleman
handsomely remunerated, the other is a mere man paid
in accordance with the name and its vulgar attributes.
• * *
The only unpaid amateur alive is the Australian.
In the forthcoming matches with the Britishers our rep-
resentatives won’t get a cent.
* * #
Likewise the interprovincial matches are all
played for love and glory. The expenses of tlie team are
paid for the team, but the individual members do not get
a copper as expenses or anything else.

The average cricketer is often a monstrous baby.

Somebody estimates that in the four days of the
Cup carnival there was exactly one hour and two minutes
of actual racing. Think of that! There were thousands
of columns of newspaper row and rot, stacks of expensive
costumes, hundreds of cablegrams and telegrams, and
oceans of swearing ; there were consultations and
totalisator sweeps innumerable ; every bookie in Australia
had been hoarse for three months with sheer yelling!
every tout had got rheumatism through going out early
to look for the straight griffin ; scores of individuals were
short in their cash through embezzling their boss’s money
to pile on a horse; scores more had arranged to take
somebody else’s wife to see the show, and thus sowed the
seeds of a divorce case ; half the nation was drunk ; about
five Parliaments were adjourned ; every small boy in this
continent was demoralised ; there were special trains and
special steamers ; there were miles of dreary preaching
about the horrors of gambling ; there was much nobbling
and lying and laying of huge wagers ; sundry persons won
large sums and started to drink themselves right to the
red-hot brass gates of Sheol, and all Australia was turned
upside down. And all for one hour and two minutes fun,
at the rate of fifteen minutes per day ! Great Caesar!

The meeting between Billy Murphy and Jem
Burge at the Sydney Amateur Gymnastic Club on Monday
night ended in a fiasco. For 27 rounds Murphy belted
Burge terribly about the ribs, Burge only relieving the
monotony by now and then standing in tipi middle of the
ring v#ith his jaw buried in his muscular shoulder, whilst
Murphy made ineffectual and savage attempts to “ knock
him out.” Burge did not seem the Burge of old, and
towards the last looked—very disheartened. Murphy’s
hands smashed up badly on the iron man, and as the pair
merely walked round and looked at each other for the
28th, and 29th rounds, the referee called the men down and
declared “no fight.” Murphy did all the fighting and
never received a blow worthy of the name from first to
last, and if only out of humanity to Burge the clubs ought
to now let him drop out of the fighting. Burge has pro-
bably taken more punishment in his career than any six
of the modern fighters put together, and it really seems a
pity to longer smash up scientific hands upon his cast-iron
frame. The “ noble art ” loses much of its manliness and
tends more to brutality when the punishment is all one-
sided, and in the interest of the sport the blubs would do
well to remember this when arranging their fixtures. The
club has now awarded Murphy £4O ; Burge gets nothing.

Dear Bulletin,—The population of Oberon
(N.S.W.) is composed principally of one family, and the
name of that family is one that from time immemorial,
especially on the Quid Sod, has been connected with shil-
laleghs, whisky, skittles, lights, and elections—to wit-
well, O'Fl.ynn. A coupleofyears ago two Sydney bookies, re-
splendent’in shiny hats, gaudy coats, and pants of a very
loud and large pattern, visited the Oberon race-meeting
“to take down the mugs.” The first and only bet was
witli one of the members of the O’F. clan named Chry-
sostom. Chrysostom deposited £2 at odds of 3to 2, arid
the rest of the family awaited the result of the race with
some anxiety, knowing that if Chrysostom lost there
would be the “divil to pay.” The race was run—Chrys.
lost. Tlie solitary policeman was away having a drink.
. . . That night those two bookmakers returned with
sorrowful visages, with broken noses and hats, no coats,
and all the glory departed (i.i pieces) from their gorgeous
check pants—pants so checked that whenever jou gazed
upon them you always wondered whose move it was next.
The Oberon racecourse no longer knows the hoarse voice
of the “ layer of odds,” and tire collective O'Flynn, looking
in vain for 3 to 2, and feeling a sense of loneliness starts
bashing the solitary “copper,” who unfortunately happens
to be a “ prodistin.”—“ r.';a ’Enry ’’—Wattle Flat.

Dear Bulletin, — In a late issue you have an
item re ski-running at Kiandrn, N.S.W., and you seem to
hardly credit that one thousand yards can be covered in
25 secs, on ski or snow-shoes. I hail from a country
where ski-running is the national sport, and think nothing
much of the feat mentioned. Everybody there has slid
down a steep hill on ski (the steeper, of course, the
higher the speed), and has thus felt a sensation
like falling through space, The speed of a race-horse
or of a locomotive is nothing to the pace one can get out
of ski. In Norway (no other country has got any ski-
running to talk about) they don’t give prizes for speed,
hut for the biggest jump. In the middle of the hill
there is piled up a lot of snow in the shape of a spring-
board, two or three yards high, and from this the runners
spring. The biggest officially-recorded jump, after
which the jumper has been able to keep his balance on
landing, was at the Kristiania Ski Club's meeting, some
six or seven years ago. The distance measured was
63 feet long and 22 feet high. The writer was an eye-
witness to tlie feat, and can vouch for the correctness of
the figures given. Have the Kiandra people got anything
like this as a record for jumps on ski ’ Funnel Bend.

When he last visited Australia George Loh-
mann, tlie English cricketer, was offreed a position in the
A.. 1.5. Bank if he would remain in Sydney, but he refused
the bait. It is thought unlikely lie would say “no” if
the offer were renewed. Lohmann’s father was on
the Stock Exchange, hut was “ hammered,” and
George himself was something in a stockbroker’s office
but found cricket more to his taste, ami quite as profit-
able. He lias been the main stay of Surrey during the
last season, but he does not forget that the Club was dis-
posed to treat him rather scurvily the season before, when
the rewards for services were being distributed. W. W.
Read received £lOO and Lohmann was put off with £25.
He struck at this and demanded more, and it was only
when he threatened to secede from the club that the
grant was increased to £5O. W. W.’s position is a sore
point with the Surrey professionals, for though he poses
as an amateur, or gentleman, he depends mainly on
cricket for his subsistence. He is nominally assistant
secretary of the Surrey Club, but nobody has ever seen
him at his desk, and in addition to the salary he receives
for his supposed secretarial work he gets a handsome
bonus every season for his cricket play. This amateur
business is a transparent sham.

George Alston, sen , one of the pioneer
settlers of South Australia, died last week, aged
90. He had been 53 years in the country, and at
one time campetl in a tent on the allotment where
the Plough and Harrow Hotel, Adelaide, now
stands. He was the first accountant of the Bank-
of S. A., and also secretary to the S. A. Agricultural
Society, in which latter capacity he was interested
in the importation of the first shipment of horses
into S. A.
Two clerics, Protestant and Catholic, have
been discussing in Sydney D. T. the question
whether the Church of England has retained the
Apostolic Succession. The Protestant gentleman
says it has and the priest says in effect that it
hasn’t—that it was born in the adulterous bed of
Henry VIII. The discussion winds up very
funnily. The Anglican parson has had last say :
“ If the Rev. D. F. Barry is right the Archbishop
of Canterbury is wrong.” That ought to settle
the matter.
Vernon Mid wood, the oldest Tasmanian
Civil Servant, has died of influenza, aged 72.
For 56 years he was a civil servant, and, for 50,
chief-clerk to the Tasmanian Supreme Court.
“ Old Mid wood ” was to old Hobartonians just as
familiar as Mount Wellington. His duties were
about the heaviest in the Civil Service, and will
be divided amongst his successors; His salary of
.£3OO was last year raised to .£350. Though the
most profitable officer in the service to his em-
ployers, he was, until quite recently, located in
the coldest, dreariest, and most uninviting dog-
hole to be found in the building, without fire or
aught to add comfort to his old age. Until a few
months ago, he never missed a day’s duties. He
was a model of kindliness and courtesy, and knew
more about the antecedents of the “ very best ”
families than any other man living, yet his innate
goodness of heart prevented him from saying
anything to harm a soul. He carried in his head
a whole library relating to the ancient records,
and could not be spared to retire on a pension,
so he died in harness, and much valuable informa-
tion has gone with him—as his successors will now
find.
It is yet too soon to pass a final judgment
upon the much-discussed Last Call Mine (capital,
A 200,000). Some people who ought to know their
way about, and who inspected it some time ago,
taking numberless samples, in the “ downiest ”
manner possible, from all over the workings, con-
cluded that the stuff averaged 14 to 20oz, all
through. Such was the experience, for instance,
of Mr. Mark Hammond, of Sydney, who is
regarded as a thoroughly honourable and straight-
forvyard man and who has given more than half a
lifetime to mining. So also was it with a wealthy
young Sydneyite who was bitten nastily at
TarangiWiba, and yet profited so little by' that
sad experience that he advised his pa, a coal-
millionaire, to invest .£5OOO in Last Galls. At

This is unfair, because if there is one thing in which his

shooting. True, he does not tramp about with dogs, and

tramp far oyer heavy country. As for the barn-door

that flies to shoot, aiid yet the Prince rarely misses one.
He is by far the best shot in the Royal Family.

will be too fat even to shoot, and then the
wretched rooster will be fetched along tied-up
with string, and the Heir-apparent will rise with
a heavy groan, and it will be planted on his
chair, and ho will laboriously sit upon it, and
smother it. The fine old British gentleman must
kill some animal or other that never did him any
harm, before he can feel happy, and whether it
is shot or sat upon the animal gets there just the
same.

W. B. Dalley.
A well-informed correspondent sends us the
following interesting gossip :
W. B. Dailey’s father kept a shop in Lower
George-street, Sydney, opposite the old Treasury,
as it was called. It was tho next house to the
“Fortune of War,” going towards Dawes Point.
His business was supplying kits for sailors, and
most of tho whaling crews, of which there were
many in those days, used to get their outfit there.
Cashing advance-notes, too, was a profitable part
of the old man’s business, and he gradually amassed
money and purchased land and houses, but he was
never what we would now call a rich man. Dailey
inherited his brains from his mother, who, though
poorly-educated, was very clever.
# # »
As a youth, W.B.D. was incorrigibly lazy, and
not by any means what would bo called sharp.
He was always the leader in any mischief. He
was forever in trouble at school, and was threatened
with expulsion from St. Mary’s Seminary, but
escaped that indignity by bolting incontinently
out of a window whilst the Rev. Dr. Gregory was
being sent for to formally expel him before his
schoolmates. The first school he was sent to was
a ladies’ seminary at the Flagstaff, kept by the
Misses L , where ho gained some knowledge
of the three R’s. Thence he was sent to St.
Mary’s, the head-master of which was the Rev.
Mr. Bourgeois, a French priest, whose severity
had, no doubt, a good deal to do with his
wild conduct, for W.B. could not bear coercion.
After bolting from St. Mary’s he studied for some
time privately. His father wanted to put him
into business, and had almost arranged to appren-
tice him to Hordern, the draper, who kept a shop
at the foot of Church Hill—Charlotte Place it
was, and may still be called. At the earnest
request of Mrs. Lett, who was very fond of the
lad and was the first to discern his ability, this
idea was abandoned, and his father having pur-
chased a barque, the Asa Packer, young Dailey
was sent to sea in her as a passenger. He had
some books on board, which he read assiduously,
and thus formed a decided taste for literature, in
which he was encouraged by the lady just named
—a woman of vex - y high mental attainments.
# * *
His father in the meantime had retired from
business with a moderate fortune, and went to
reside in one of two houses which he had built
opposite the Legislative buildings in Macquarie-
street, Sydney. Here young Dailey fell ill, and was
for long confined to bed through an affection of the
neck. During his prolonged illness he was
encouraged by his life-long friend, Mrs. Lett, to
study, and he set to work and learned Latin and
Greek. Only for a short time had he a tutor, so
it may bo truly said that he was entirely self-
educated, as he had no one but Mrs. Lett to direct
his studies. As ho became convalescent he used
to spend a portion of his time listening to the
debates in the Legislative Council —“they were
giants there in those days and having a
marvellous memory, ho was able to repeat
almost verbatim speeches he had heard delivered
by Wentworth, Lowe, Cowper, Darvall and the
other orators who were then members of the
single house of Legislature. His constant atten-
dance attracted I lie attention of !3ir Charles
Nicholson, the Speaker, and other members, and
the youngster was permitted to roam about the
Council buildings, and to take Ins seat in the
gallery without the formality of an order. Often
and often has the writer heard him repeat the
ipsissima verba of some long speech which he had
heard in the Chamber. Ho thus gradually
acquired a readiness of tongue, which increased
as he grew older, until at last he used to discard
repetition, and make speeches of his own on the
burning topics of the day, bis audience generally
being composed of his mother and father, and Mrs.
Lett. The writer was then a small boy, who
shared the worship of tho others for the young
prodigy, as he was then considered.
« * «
The advent of Deniehy with his brilliant con-
versational and oratorical powers at this lime
acted as an additional incentive to Dailey, and he
studied harder than ever. Having selected the
Law as his future profession, he devoted himself
to Blackstone, and in due course was called to the
bar in 1850. From this time forward his history
is known to everybody.
# # #
Ho was not what could be called a cultured man
in the full sense of the term. He had a fair
knowledge of Latin, but knew little of Greek, and
nothing of mathematics. He had a smattering of
French, though he could never speak it fluently,
and could read Italian. He was thus able to
learn something of the literature of France and
Italy, though he read most of the best authors in
translations. Having an extraordinary memory,
and being quick of apprehension, he readily picked
up a smattering of knowledge from men like
Stenhouse, Badham and Stephen o , with whom he
was intimate. In this way, being a good talker, he
acquired among the public the reputation of being a
profoundly read man, which he decidedly was
not. But he was a good listener, and in the pres-
ence of his superiors in knowledge he had the good
sense to remain silent and take in all that he
heard. •
* # •
As a political satirist he was only inferior to
Deniehy .and William Forster, the latter of whom
was a staunch friend and ally of his. They were
united by the bond of common hatred of Farkes,
and they took up Sydney Punch and wrote for it
without fee or reward on condition that it was
made a. party organ. He was also associated with
Allan Macpherson in the Laughing Jackass
which was started by the latter, avowedly for the
purpose of opposing Parkes. Macpherson, Dailey,
Forster, and occasionally Macleay, kept the
Jackass going until it was quietly suppressed
after a specially venomous attack on Macpherson’s
bogey Parkes, in which he was cartooned as Titus
Oates in the pillory. This was in connection with
the O’Farrell business.
* # #
I almost forget now whether Frank Hutchinson
wrote for the Laughing Jackass, but I think
not. Grosvenor Bunster did a little sometimes.
The contributors used to meet like conspirators,
at night, at Macpherson’s house in PhiJip-street.
It was a mysterious sort of place, partly under-
ground, and one had to go down a flight of steps
to the front door. Occasionally Miss Kitty
C , the actress, a friend of Macpherson’s,
used to be admitted to the conclave. The
Jackass took a prominent part in the attacks
upon Parkes, arising out of the O’Farrell case, and
the “Kiama Ghost” was worked with good
effect. It was on a hint from the police that the
paper was stopped.
Probably the finest forensic speech Dailey ever
made was in defending Dr. Benton Beatty, a
young medical man, charged with criminally
assaulting a woman patient of his at Forbes or
Grenfell, I forget which. He was tried at
Bathurst assizes, and having no friends or money,
Dailey was assigned for the defence by Mr.
Justice Cheeke. Macintosh was assigned as
solicitor in the case, and a verdict of acquittal
resulted. If ever the hand of Providence inter-
posed to save a human being’s life, it was in tins
case. The circumstances arc too long to relate
here, suffice it to say that the case for the Crown
(Butler prosecuted) was irresistible, and it was
only by tho merest acc'dent that Tom Symonds
(one of the best whips that ever handled
a team, and who drove on the Western Road
before the railway era, and afterwards kept a
public-house nearßowenfcls) came into court, and
seeing the woman recognised her, and calling
the acting Crown - Solicitor, gave him cer-
tain information which, in the interests of Jus-
tice, he communicated to the counsel for the
defence. The case was concluded at two o’clock
in the morning, when, as I have said, the accused
was acquitted. Dailey’s address to the jury was,
unfoitunately, owing to the late hour at which it
was made, never reported properly, but it was one
of the most powerful and thrilling speeches I have
ever heard in a court of justice. Butler was so im-
pressed by it that he did not exercise his right of
reply. Dailey was full of sentimentality and
chivalry, and when heinterested himself inacase the
question of fees never entered into his calculations.
He was quite as earnest in his defence of a pauper,
if there was anything in tho case which appealed
to his feelings, as if he had received 1000 guineas—
which was the amount marked on his biief for the
defence of Yivers, for horse-stealing at Armidale
Assizes.

It was a treat to sec Dailey defending a prisoner
in a big case and old “ Paddy ” Butler prosecut-
ing, for each was unsurpassed in his own line. It
must be admitted, however, that Butler was the
superior where solid facts had to be sifted and
marshalled before a jury, and in knocking a hole
in an alibi he was unequalled, as the records of
the bushrangers’ trials will attest. •

Dailey was very partial to making speeches in
dog-Latin, which used to create considerable
amusement amongst people like Dick Hill, who
didn’t understand a word of them. It was a
strong point with him, by the way, to select an
audience which knew little of the subject he was
talking about, to be in fact a “ Triton among
minnows.” This propensity for dog-Latinity
once led him into a fool sh position. There was
at the Nortli Shore an old Catholic priest,
Dr. Powell, who was exceedingly well-edu-
cated, but very eccentric. Ho was modest
withal and did not air his extensive knowledge,
so that people did not know that the somewhat
shabby old clergyman could speak tho dead
languages colloquially with the utmost fluency.
Going down the harbour one day with a picnic
party—l think Macleay was tho host—the playful
W. 8.D., being in one of his merry moods, thought
he would “make a hare ” of the poor old padre ,
and addressed him in one of his Latin speeches.
The priest listened patiently till the oration was
concluded, and then rose and expressed his
regret that he was not so well acquainted with
the language in which Horace wrote as his young
and brilliant friend, but as he had, thanks to an
Irish hedge-school education, a slight smattering
of another classic tongue, he would take the liberty
of replying to him in it, which he proceeded to do
—to the great delight of Dr. Badham, greatest of
Greek scholars. This covered Dailey with con-
fusion. This lesson was never forgotten.

the Pyrenees against France; but she will have

STILL IN THE LEAD.
The great remedy for pain, St. Jacobs Oil, is a
wonder surely. But it is the result only of tru i
medical science and research. Such a discovery
had a right to prominence. It has cured wherever
used as directed. Founded upon the intrinsic
merit of each element, which, in combination,
proved to bo the perfection of cure, its virtue haa
made it what it is.
THE PEOPLE
of the United States know its name, and name it
as a remedy which should be in every house, for
every homo knows its value, as a sterling
comforter, the truest relief,
THE WORLD OWNS IT.
Canada took it up and adopted it as a standard
cure. It crossed the ocean, on demand, and alike
in Scotland, England, and Ireland, in the extremes
of climate and temperature, it is the same
sovereign Conqueror of Pain, Distinguished men
and physicians of South and Central America,
have used and recommended it, and street-criers
have sung its praise in verso in the streets of
Mexico, A member of Parliament
IN SOUTH AFRICA
praised it in open debate, and the same was done
by a U.S. Senator. In India it won its first gold
medal at the Calcutta Exposition, where expert
chemists and physicians awarded it its due; and
by merit it has won in all similar competitions.
One of the most distinguished scholars of Germany
thought it his duty to praise it, and such has been
its meed from Prelates, Potentates, and the Press.
A distinguished traveller comments on its use in
Egypt. It was the comforter and cure of the lost,
half-frozen Arctic explorers of the Greeley expedi-
tion.
BRITISH SOLDIERS AND SAILORS.
It found its place in the knapsacks of the British
soldiers in the Soudan, and its permanent supply
to the medicine chests of her Majesty’s warships.
This would seem enough to show what it is
doing ; but one other potent fact can’t be dis-
regarded. It holds its own as the best known
remedy of tiro ago for rheumatism, neuralgia,
lumbago, sciatica, and all painful ailments. It
has taken its place in the trade of tins continent,
and has received from many of its numerous
patrons throughout these colonies, as elsewhere,
tatements that cures, made by its healing virtues,
Tom the date of cure to the date of response,
embracing a lapse of years, have remained per-
manent without recurrence.

A POPULAR MISTAKE.
Many people have an idea that the Waterbury,
because a cheap watch, is therefore cheaply made.
A visit to the company’s factory, at Waterbury,
Conn., would decidedly alter this impression. On
seeing the extent and variety of the machinery
used, and the neatness, order, and organisation
there exhibited, you begin to realise that making
a cheap watch (and a good one) is not by any
means the off-hand affair you had thought it was.
As you pass through department after department
and observe the working of wonderful automatic
machines, which make parts so fine you can
scarcely see them, and yet so accurate that they
can be taken at random and fitted together to
form a perfect watch; as you note the handling
of the parts by dainty and skilful fingers, the
delicacy of the process, and the thoroughness and
care as to every detail, you find it difficult to
imagine that they are not making hundred-dollar
watches ; and you then become convinced that the
Waterbury is cheap, not because poorly made, but
because unique and simple in construction.

THOUSANDS ARE NOW IN USE IN ENGf AND.
Hammerless guns are fast displacing the old
style, for the reason that the absence of hammers
is safer, offering no obstacle to catch in bush,
&c., to send gun off' accidentally, and also
affording a quicker sight, which is very essen-
tial in snap shooting.

The cheapest breechloader sold heretofore
was at least double the price of this gun, and
we say positively, much inferior.
The barrel and action of the Peerless gun are
of European manufacture and have formerly
been rifle barrels, and of quite as good quality of
metal as the most expensive gun in use, being
manufactured directly under government super-
vision, and only passed after most severe tests.
The boring and chambering have been done
with the one view of hard hitting and close
snooting. So simple and compact is the action,
that we assert it to be almost an impossibility

The celebrated English Hozier divorce-
case, which was expected to give to the world
some queer revelations, has been squared, it is
said. It will be recollected that Mr. Ashmead
Bartlett threatened to criminally prosecute any-
one who used his name in connection with this
scandal.
Murder or Mercy?
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Yes, we had got the run from our billets and
our lodgings in one day. Jim Nolan and I were
room mates and worked in the same store, and his
father had taken up a selection alongside my
father’s, so that is how we were mates.
“Look here, Jim,” I said, “let’s clear out of
town. It’s no use hunting for billets. The old
lady’ll object to my doing it because she always
reckoned on me becoming a big storekeeper, but
I’m not made for it.”
“ Well, I’m made to graft at anything that’s
got tucker hanging to it till times are better,”said
Jim.
“Well, what d’ye say to going scalping out
Womalilla way?” I proposed ; “there's whips o’
red ’tins out there, and skins fetch a good price
besides the scalp-money.”
“ I’m on,” said Jim. “ I’ll got my Winchester
from the old lady, and, I suppose, the boss’ll let us
have a few thousand rounds at trade price. What
about tents and rations? ”
“I’ll fix that,” said I, “I’ll write to the old man
to send the tents over the Chinchilla Station, and
some tucker, and we’ll get 'em as we pass. We
can get a pad horse in Mitchell, besides something
to ride.”
So wo got it all fixed up to have a long spell of
work. Next thing we were camped out on
W omalilla Creek and getting in a good stack of
skins. Jim was the hand with a knife I ever
saw. He’d make the first cut and give a few
punches with his hand, and off would come the
whole pelt, and not a scar on it but what the lead
had made.
It was a grand life. There was just enough
work to make a good living, and fresh air and sun
to give us an appetite. What on earth makes so
many men drift to town who can’t do anything
there? Oftentimes it’s a fellow’s mother, who
wants to see him a cut above a boundary-rider or
stockman, or even a selector, and sends him down
to try his luck at growing into a gentleman. 1
know it was that way with me. The old lady
wanted mo to be a “big storekeeper,” and we
boys had almost always done her wishes.
But this isn’t the story I started to tell. Jim
and I were doing well, for, not reckoning scalps,
the hides alone were worth a crown apiece. Then
one unlucky day Jim had an idea, which is a
dangerous thing in unpractised hands.
“ What d'ye say to some honey on yer bread
for supper?” he asked me.
“All right,” I replied; “send round and get
some,”
“Don't be an ass,” responded Jim; “fetch an
axe and a bucket, while I go and get my crosscut.”
Well, we started out, and came to a tree about
half-a-mile from the camp, where Jim had spotted
a bees’ nest—regular hybrids. We’d both got
mosquito-net on our hats, because the hybrids are
more savage than a mob of scrub bulls. Jim gave
the butt of the tree a thump with the axe.
“ Pretty solid down here, anyhow,” he said.
But the jar had made the swarm hum.
“ By Jove ! it’s a big swarm,” observed Jim, as
they came out unanimously. Then I ran my
eye up the trunk. It was a b’g carbeen, and went
up as straight and plumb as a rush for about forty
feet.
“ What way’ll he fall ?” I asked dubiously.
“ Better try and let the wind drop him. He’s
too plumb for my liking.”
So we ripped into him on the lee side till about
half-way across. Then we undercut it. It seemed
solid right through. Then we started on the
windward side, and we hadn’t cut more than two
inches when we were into the pipe. It had run to
one side of the tree, and all that side was a shell.
It had been struck by lightning, too, some time or
other, judging by the big limb smashed off at the
fork. We hadn’t got more than four inches into
the cut when she went “crack!” like a pistol-
shot. There was no groaning such as you hear
from a tree that has a bit of a lean.
“Run !” was all Jim said as the tree began to
dip.
Well, it seemed to drop without beginning at
all. I hadn’t waited for Jim to say “run,” but
cleared like a racehorse. Suddenly I heard a
yell, and I looked round. The crash of the tree
and that yell were nearly in one; if there was any
difference the yell was a bit ahead. I couldn't see
Jim anywhere, as the tree, instead of falling with
the wind, had got swung round by a strip of hard
deadwood which had been overgrown by green
wood. This strip was between the two cuts.
“God help the poor old chap,” I said, “for I
can’t.”
The stump of the broken limb was bearing on
his legi; they were fairly driven into the ground.
His eyes were shut, but I could see his chest still
heaving, and presently he began to groan and
writhe a little. I was trying to cut off a branch
that was nigh his face and had cut his dheek. I
was clean off my head. I didn’t know what to do.
I couldn’t cut through the top of the trunk and
saw off the main branch without cutting him.
Besides, I couldn’t have rolled the block off him
myself. I got the branch clear of his face, and I
could see that his eyes were opened. I bent over
him.
“Jim, my poor boy,” I says, “ I can’t get vou
out.”
He roused a little when he heard me speak.
“No use,” he said. “ Tommy, I’m bound for the
Never Never.”
I knew it, too. If I had got him out he would
have died all the same. Presently he gave an
awful shriek. God grant that I may never hear
the like again. The bees couldn’t get out before,
because the hole was against the ground and the
other end of the pipe in the tree was stuffed with
mud, but when I cut away that limb that was
lying on Jim’s face I had made a way for them to
get out without knowing it.
“Tommy,” he yelled, “finish me quick, for
Christ’s sake! Don’t leave me to be stung to
death ! Tommy, where’s your revolver? Quick,
shoot!”
My revolver was in its pouch on my belt. The
agony on his face and in his voice was awful.

The Waiting Juliet.*
(Extracted from the Memoirs of Gabriel Foote,
Highwayman.)
The house in question was what Peter the Scholar
(who corrects my proof-sheets) calls one of the
rusinurby sort —the front facing a street and the
back looking over a turfed garden, with a lime-
tree or two, a laburnum, and a lawn-tennis court
marked out, its white lines plain to see in the
starlight. At the end of the garden, a door,
painted dark-green, led into a narrow lane between
high walls, where, if two persons met, one had to
turn sideways to let the other pass. The entrance
to this lane was cut in two by a wooden post
about the height of your hip, and just beyond
this, in the high-road, George was waiting for us
with the dog-cart.
We had picked the usual time —the dinner-hour.
It had just turned dark and the church clock, two
streets away, was chiming the quarter after eight,
when Peter and I let ourselves in by the green-
door I spoke of, and felt along the wall for the
gardener’s ladder that we knew was hanging there.
A simpler job there never was. The bedroom
window on the first floor stood right open to the
night air; and inside was a faint candle-light
flickering, just as a careless maid will leave them
after her mistress has gone down to dinner. To
be sure, there was a chance of her coming back to
put them out; but we could hear her voice going
in the servants’ hall as we lifted the ladder and
rested it against the sill.
“She’s good for half-an-hour yet,” Peter whis-
pered, holding the ladder while I began to climb;
“but if I hear her voice stop, I’ll give the signal
to be cautious. ”
I went up softly, pushed my head above the
level of the sill, and looked in.
It was a roomyplace, with a great half-testerbed,
hung with curtains, standingout from thewallonmy
right. The, curtains were of chintz, a dark back-
ground with flaming red poppies sprawling over it;
and the further curtain hid the dressing-table, and
the candles on it and the jewel-case that I confi-
dently hoped to stand upon it also. A bright
Brussels carpet covered the floor, and the wall-
paper, I remember—though, for the life of me, I
cannot tell why—was a pale-gray ground, worked
up to imitate watered silk, with sprigs of gilt
honeysuckle upon it.
I looked round and listened for half a minute.
The house was still as death up here —not a sound
in the room or in the passages beyond. With a
nod to Peter to hold the ladder firm, I lifted one
leg over the sill, then the other, dropped my feet
carefully upon the thick carpet, and went quickly
round tlie bed to the dressing-table.
But at the corner, and as soon as ever I saw
round the chintz curtain, my knees gave way, and
I put out my hand toward the bed-post.
Before the dressing-table, and in front of the
big glass in which she could see my white face,
was an old lady seated.
She wore a blaze of jewels and a low gown, out
of which rose the scraggiest neck and shoulders I
have ever looked on. Her hair was thick with
black dye and fastened with a diamond star.
Between the two candles the powder showed on
her cheek-bones like flour on a miller’s coat. Chin
on hand, she was gazing steadily into the mirror
before her, and, even in my fright, I had time to
note that a glass of sherry and a plate of rice and
curry stood at her elbow, among the rouge-pots <■
and powder-puffs.
While I stood stock-still and pretty well scared
out of my wits, she rose, still staring at my image
in the glass, folded her hands modestly over her
bosom, and spoke, in a deep, tragical voice :
“ The prince !”
Then, facing sharply round, she held out her
thin arms.
“ You have come—at last ?”
There was not much to say to this except that I
had. So I confessed it. Even with the candles
behind her, I could see her eyes glowing like a
dog’s, and an uglier poor creature this world
could scarcely show.
“ Is the ladder set against the window ?”
“ Since you seem to know, ma’am,” said I, “ it
is.”
“Ah, Romeo! Your cheeks are ruddy—your
poppies are too rod.”
“ Then I’m glad my colour’s come back ; for, to
tell the truth, you did give me a turn just at first.
You were looking out for me, no doubt ”
“ My prince!” She stretched out her arms
again, and, being pretty well at my wits’ end, I
lat her embrace me. “It has been so long,” she
said . “ oh , the weary while ! And they ill-treat
me Where have you been all this tedious time?”
j was not go j ng to
answer that, you may be
sure . By this, I had recovered myself sufficiently
to guess what was near the truth—that she was a
mac j aun fc of the family below, and that the game
was j n my kands if j played with decent care. So
j met her question with another,
«Look here,” 1 said ; “ I’m running a consider-
able risk in braving these persecutors of your’s.
Hadn’t we better elope at once ? ”
“j am rea dy ”
« And the jewels? You won’t leave them to
yonr enemies I suppose ”
She turned to the dressing-table, lifted her
jewel-case, and put it into my hands.
“I am ready,” she repeated ; “ let us be quick
and stealthy as death.”
she followed me to the window and, looking
d rew back

“ Ive a fire-arm in my pocket,” whispered he,
pulling up, “ and I’m going to fire it off to relieve
my feelings, if you don’t explain here and now.
Who, in pity’s name, is she ? ”
“You mug—she’s the Original Sleeping Beauty.
I’m eloping with her, and you've got her jewels.”
“Pardon me, Jem,” he says, in his gentlemanly
way, “if I don’t quite see. Are you taking her
off to melt her or marry her? For how to get rid
of her else ”
The poor old creature had halted, too, three
paces ahead of us, and waited while we whispered,
with the moonlight, that slanted down into the
lane, whitening her bare neck and flashing on her
jewels.
“One moment,” I said, and stepped forward to
her; “you had better take off those ornaments
here, my dear, and give them to my servant to
take care of. There’s a carriage waiting for us at
the end of the lane, and when he has stowed them
under the seat we can climb in and drive off ”
“To the end of the world—to the very rim of
it, inyhero.”
She pulled the gems from her ears, hair, and
bosom, and handed them to Peter, who received
them with a bow. Next, she searched in her
pocket and drew out a tiny key. Peter unlocked
the case, and, having carefully stowed the dia-
monds inside, locked it again, handed back the
key, touched his hat, and walked off towards the
dog-cart.
“My dearest lady,” I began, as soon as we
were alone between the high walls, “if the devo-
tion of a life ”
Her bare arm crept into mine. “There is but a
little time left for us in which to bo happy. Year
after year I have marked off this almanac; day
by day I have watched the dial. I saw my sisters
married, and my sisters’ daughters ; and still I
waited. Each had a man to love her and tend
her, but none had such a man as I would have
chosen. They were none like you, my prince ! ’
“ No, I dare say not.”
“ Oh, but my heart is not so cold. Take my
hand—it is firm and strong; touch my lips—they
are burning ”
A low whistle sounded at the top of the lane.
As I took her hands 1 pushed her back, and, turn-
ing, ran for my life. I suppose that, as I ran, I
counted forty before her scream came, and then
the sound of her feet pattering after me.
She must have run like a demon ; for I was less
than ten yards ahead when Peter caught my wrist
and pulled me up on to the back seat of the dog-
cart. And before George could set the horse going,
her hand clutched at the flap on which my feet
rested. It missed its grasp, and she never got
near enough again. But for half a minute I looked
into that horrible face following us and working
with silent rage; and for half a mile at least I
heard the patter of her feet in the darkness be-
hind. Indeed, I can hear it now. Q.

“ A Study in Heredity.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I. —Two Newspaper Extracts.
April 17, 1888. —Yesterday at the Central
Criminal Court, Augustus Charles Desmond, soli-
citor’s clerk, was found guilty of forging a deed,
and was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment
with hard labour.
Sept. 29, 1891.—Yesterday, at the . . Police
, Court, Barbara Desmond, aged 22, postal assistant
at that suburb, was committed for trial on a charge
of stealing money from a letter, the property of
the Postinaster-General.
XL— Passages' From a Diary.
April 16, 1888.— How shall I pen the words?
Oh, -that I had died before I had heard that ter-
rible sentence from the Judge’s lips which sent
my father to gaol for four years. Four years !
And the shame and the disgrace of it all to be
borne for four years before we can go away to a
strange place, for mother says she will not'leave
this city till lie is freed. Up to the last, up to the
very moment of the sentence, I believed him inno-
cent, believed there had been some awful mistake
or some foul conspiracy at work. Up to the
moment? No, beyond it : till the Judge read out
the record of father’s previous conviction. His
precious conviction —O God, why hast Thou per-
mitted me to live, to know this of my father to
whom I owe duty and reverence? Thou hast laid
Thy Commandment upon me to honour him, to
obey him, and how can Ido either? But, forgive
me, O God, for this, my doubting! Thou, hast
some wise purpose in this chastisement, surely.
01), give me Thy peace and Thy forgiveness, and
teach me, O Heavenly Father, to bear the blow
patiently and still to regard him with that love
which it has been my joy to give him to now,
although —but I must not admit even to you, my
diary, what at times I fear he is.
Ap.'il 17. —Mother is calmer to-day, and forces
hersjff to think and speak more rationally of this
terrible, terrible disgrace. I resolved when I rose
this morning to. forget my own pain if I could,
and to minister to her, but I have failed miserably
—miserably. Tasked her to-night did she know
of the previous crime which the Judge said was
recorded against him. She would not answer for
a while, but I pressed her, and then she told me.
Two. years— for a! similar offence, twelve years
ago, when we lived up country. I remembered,
then ! I was a slip of a girl, just like, I suppose,
Connie Williams is now—and father was away for
a long time, and people gave up coming to see us,
and mother took me from school, and after a while
we came to the city where he joined us, I recol-
lect how I thought he had been away for a long
sea-voyage. One or other must have told me so.
How can parents lie to their children ? How dare
they have children when they are tainted so? Oh,
I’ll never marry, never ! Two sentences upon my
father, my father! Oh, the shame of it, the
wrong of it! And how dare I face my school-
class on Sunday ? They may not know, may
not understand all the ignominy if they do
—but no, children are so quick they will
know. And then there are my fellow-teachers —
how will they receive me? As though, O Lord,
my cross is not heavy enough to bear, wilt Thou
make it heavier by turning my work in Thy
service into the source of a new burden?
April 18. —After I closed my diary last night
the thought came to me that I should resign my
teachership in the Sunday-school. I fought
against it, for my work there and the preparation
for it, have been my chief, I may say, my only
pleasures, outside my home. And that is wrecked
now—and shall I rob myself of that which re-
mains? So I reasoned the best part of the night
—I scarcely slept at all. But I have made up my
mind to give it up. The necessity is very bitter,
but my disgrace will not only expose me to
humiliation, it will bring insult upon His work.
People won’t let their children be taught by the
daughter of a man who is in prison. It is very
hard to give it up, but I think it is ray duty.
After all, why should I forrow? Is it not giving
up at His command “ what most I prize?’ Ah,
there is a new truth there for me ! I have been
thinking that when “He calls us to resign ” any-
thing it must be worldly tilings and pleasures
only that is meant. Now, I perceive that He may
call upon us as a proof of our affection for Him to
abandon work in His own service. If only I
could be so sure that it is His wish that I should
give up my school-work and not merely that I am
a coward and fearful of meeting the pitying and
contemptuous looks of the other teachers and
scholars.
April 20.—Yesterday I wrote to the Superin"
tendent tendering my resignation. To-night he
called, in company with our clergyman, to request
me to withdraw it. They were both so kind and
sympathising and said such gratifying things as to
my success with my class that I would have felt
proud under any other circumstances, but how
could I feel pleased with this shame hanging over
us ? They would not hear of my giving up the
class, and said there was nothing but the sineerest
sympathy felt for mother and myself in our
grievous trouble. Mr. Lawrence made one remark
which did me so much good. I had said that the
parents of my pupils , would object to have their
children brought into contact with a girl with a
stain. Mr. Lawrence grew indignant at the
thought, and said there was another side to that
argument. If he'heard of any one man or woman
who dwelt upon my father’s wrong-doing, he
would remind him'or her that the self-sacrificing
devotion of my mother’s father would have to be
taken into account if they were going to weigh
inherited qualities. “Your grandfather’s life,
dear Miss Desmond ” —these were his very
words —“ was an education to me, and I know
to many others. Have you forgotten the story of
his carrying the sick woman for hundreds of yards
through the sleety rain to shelter, how he wrapped
his own thin coat around her, going through the
storm himself in his shirt-sleeves unprotected, and
how that exposure killed him?” This was all
news to me and I told him so. I had known that
grandpa was a poor, hard-working clergyman, but
I did not know that he had led a life “ singular,”
as Mr. Lawrence put it, “in the purity of its
philanthropy, and its heroic unselfishness,” nor
that an account of his life had been written which
—again I quote Mr. Lawrence —“ was a elassic in
the literature of wise charity.” It was very sweet
to me to hear this, but so surprising ! I had no
idea grandpa’s biography had been distinguished
by remarkable qualities. “If,” concluded the
minister, “you would leave us, Miss Desmond,
because of this present trouble, on the other hand,
do not be deaf to the call that comes from your
grandfather s career. No grandchild of his can
rightly say ‘ No ’ to a good work when it is wait-
ing to her hand.” And so, at last, I consented to
go on with my classes. May He help me to put
self out of sight and to accept fresh shame if it
comes as a new call to bear patiently the cross He
has placed upon me !
April 21.—Mr. Lawrence sent me a copy of
grandfather Pentecost’s “Life.” I spent the
afternoon and'evening reading it. Oh, how good,
how generous he was—how thoughtless of self.
Think of that man being my grandfather who
staggered through the blinding storm coatless,
who, when the small-pox patient, dying in the
miserable attic, moaned that he had no human
friend to ki.-s him “as he was going into the
dark,” stooped and pi’essed his lips to the lips that
oozed contagion and death ! 1 thank Thee, O
God, that Thou hast permitted that good man’s
blood to run in my veins as well as but, oh,
this is wrong, this is dishonouring to my father
who is still my parent, whatever he may be as a
man. . . . Tasked mother to-night why she
had never told me much about grandpa. She said
she had not dared, for father had forbidden her to
speak much about him. He—-father—had never
believed in grandpa’s sincerity—had maintained
that he must have been making money out of his
work—“ Money ! ” here cried mother. “ when
many and many a night his family went supper-
less to bed so that others might have one meal a
day!”—and he had quarrelled with grandpa
because he would not share with him what father
called “ the plunder.” How terrible must all
this have been for mother ! And then father
made her promise that she would not go in “for
the goody-goody and charitable line,” and she
lias been expecting him to interfere with mycla's-
work again and again. 1 did not know anything
of this, and I am thankful now I did not, because
the knowledge that one of my parents withheld
approval of my church-work, even from wrong
motives, would have been a trial and a distraction
to me. To think of mother’s hidden life all these
years! “To close every channel of charitable
effort against myself, child,” she said, “robbed
me of half my existence, for, like my father, I
was eager to do what I could to relieve others’
woe.” Poor mother ! Poorer father !
April 22.—How needless were my anxieties!
How ashamed I am that my carnal fears of what
the world would say crushed for a time my faith
in God’s - over-ruling Providence ! This very
trouble has been made to do me good while
humbling me. There was an additional kindness,
a new sympathy, in my fellow-teachers’ reception
of me to-day, that expressed hovy they felt for
and suffered with me. Not a word to hurt me
from anyone ! Only one reference to it, and that
from a tiny, lisping thing of five, Connie Williams’
little sister, who always comes with her into the
class. She climbed as usual into my lap, and,
stroking my face, whispered—“Poo’ Miss
De’mond ! Is ’oo papa in prison?” Connie
heard her, and pulled her away sharply before I
could interfere, for though I had been anticipating
same allusion to it, yet when it came from baby-
lips I was stung to tears. I strove to hide them,
but it was no use, and a moment after I knew,
though not seeing, that every girl in the class was
crying as well. I can never forget their sympathy.
I love them the more now that I know how fond
they are of me. It would, indeed, have cut me
to the heart, have robbed me of a great joy, to
have given up my work for them.
Sept. 18, 1891. —Father was released to-day.
Mother went and met him, and brought him
home. He is greatly changed for the worse—
more cynical, always sneering. But it is sinful to
judge him.' After I was off duty to-night, and
before I came home for tea, I went to see Connie
Williams. Poor tiling, my heart bleeds for her !
—and I. feel the more acutely for her that I can-
not help her. To think of all their money going
so quickly through the failure of that bank. No .
a penny in the house —credit with the tradesmen
stopped—and the doctor insisting that the only
hope for her is to keep her nourished by wines
and food-essences ! O God, why dost Thou permit
such things to be ! But how wicked I am to pen
a sentence like that. Of course, He permits pain
and suffering for ends which must be good
because they are His. Still, it is very, very hard
to watch dear ones in agony that might, perhaps,
be relieved if there were any money ava lable.
And to think that the manager of the bank kept
race-horses out of the depositors’ money !
Sept. 25.—Saw Connie again this evening, this
being my early evening off. Took her a few
oranges. How grateful she was ! It was piteous
to receive her thanks for so paltry a gift. The
doctor came in as 1 was leaving. 1 asked him if
there was nothing that would do her good except
wine. He said, no; wine would keep up her
strength and enable her to light the pain-. She
was dying from exhaustion, such food as was
obtainable she could not assimilate. She ought
to go into the hospital, but her mother would not
hear of it. She was too proud, she had told him,
to let her child go into an institution for paupers.
I sold my brooch to-night for ten shillings. I
must take some wine to Connie, my poor Connie,
Who has been my favourite pupil all these years.
Sept. 2tith.—Oh, how can I tell the story of
this awful day ?- and yet, I must, for i swore to
put everything down, every wrong act, every sin,
that so I might build myself up spiritually by the
exercise of self-examination. O God, what a
hypocrite I must be in Thy sight—how dare I
hope for Thy forgiveness ! But I must tell the
terrible story. This morning, when I got to the
office, I sent, first thing, a note to Connie to cheer
up, for I would bring her some wine - I intended
buying it, after I came off duty this afternoon,
and taking it round. At noon, however, when I
went home for luncheon, father asked me what
money I had—l told him I had only a shilling in
hand besides the ten shillings I received for the
brooch, and said for what purpose I designed that
sum. He insisted upon my giving him the money;
he had not given me jewellery to sell to keep
other people’s brats in luxury, he said. “I was
following in my dear grand-father Pentecost’s
footsteps, was I? ” No ; not if he knew it! He
didn’t choose that a daughter of his should be—
A nerve o’er which did creep,
The else unfelt oppressions of mankind.
That was the wfeakest sentiment Shelley ever gave
utterance to, he thought. But, of course, I didn’t
know Shelley—Shelley was too wicked a poet for
a young saint like me to appreciate, though he
was worth five thousand mawkish, Bible-inspired
Tennysons. And he went on like this all lunch-
hour. O God, forgive him for his words and for
taking the money !
Sept. 27., 6.30 a.in.—l could not finish my story
of yesterday—it was too shameful to go down, all
of it at once ! But I will force myself to do it!
Perhaps I would not have had so horrible a night
had I dared to face the terrible truth. I have
never slept. Here it is—here is the truth ! O
Diary—l am a thief ! There, the word is down.
Why does it not burn a hole in the page, like the
fact is burning into my conscience? This is how
it all occurred. When I returned to the office
after lunch yesterday I was distressed to under-
stand how I could keep my word to Connie. I
knew how she would look forward not only to my
visit, but to the receipt of the wine—how the mere

then—(oh, how shall I write it!) —the answer
came, as in my sin I thought, when 1 took up a
letter in tire course of making up the mail for the
head office. The letter contained money notes,
I knew by the feel of it —and the notion flashed
into my mind just to take one, to copy the address
of the letter, and to send the equivalent of the
money in stamps as soon as I could manage to
save the amount. Hardly knowing what 1 did, 1
did not enclose the letter in the bag. I laid it
aside, and later, opened it. Oh, God ! Oh, God.

lll.— Newspaper Extract.
October 31, 1891.—At the General Sessions
yesterday, the girl Desmond, late postal assistant
at Post-office, accused of stealing money
from a letter, pleaded guilty to the charge. The
Crown-Prosecutor handed to the presiding Judge
a Diary kept by the prisoner, which had been
seized by the police, and which, it is understood,
contained entries which were virtually a confession
of the crime. Had it been necessary to call
evidence, the book would have been adduced in
support of the accusation. His Honor, without
comment, ordered the prisoner to be released
under the provisions of the “First Offenders
Probation Act,” and the statutory recognisances
were entered into by the- young woman’s father
and the Rev. J. Laurence.

HE LIGHTS HIS PIPE ONCE MORE.
Some fifty years ago the English ship “Argos’
was wrecked on a low-lying key or sand island of
the Bahama group. Only one man, a sailor, was
thrown safely on the beach by the waves. In his
pocket was a tin tobacco-box, a pipe, and a flint
and steel. Wringing the water from his clothes,
he seated himself, lighted his pipe, and with true
British phlegm proceeded to consider his situa-
tion. The moral of which is that when an English-
man, having the means, refuses to smoke, he is in
very bad form.
Eor example, here is a man who says, “ I always
enjoyed my pipe, but now I couldn’t take a whiff.”
To be sure, there was a reason, and he puts it in
this way. “Up to Michaelmas, 1887,” he says,
“I was a strong, healthy man. About this time
I began to feel bad at my stomach and had no
relish for food. I had a bad taste in the mouth,
and after eating I would retch and vomit until
the water oozed out of my eyes; and so bad was
this that my wife had to hold my head. My eyes
turned yellow, and I felt low, weak, and nervous.
Sometimes I would break out into a sweat and
then go cold and chilly.
“ I couldn’t touch solid food, and for months I
belched up sour water; and what I did eat lay
heavy upon, and seemed to be dead and lifeless in
my body. Feeling low and depressed, I had no
enjoyment in company.
“ Before this 1 teas ahvays cheerful and enjoyed
my pipe, hut now I couldn't take a whiff.
“I had a craving, gnawing pain at the stomach,
which nothing eased for long together. I had
bran poultices applied, and took different kinds of
medicine, but nothing went to the spot, nothing
eased me. After a time I had to give up my work,
for I got so weak and nervous I couldn't hit my
work iron, and my tools and things flew out of my
hand.
“ For over four months I did not have a single
good night’s rest. I would turn and turn in bed
all night long, and my wife and I often sat up the
best part of the night rather than go to bed. I
went so thin that my clothes fairly hung upon me.
Friends who cam.e to see me told one another I
could not get better, and even my wife said I
would do no more work in this world.
“ For more than twelve months I had a clever
doctor attending me, but his medicine did me no
good ; then I went to see a physician at Sudbury,
with the same result. The doctors sounded my
lungs, but found nothing wrong, and said all my
ailments were brought on by bad digestion,
“ I now got weaker and weaker, and had given
up all hopes of recovery, when in the spring of
1889 a lady from London who was staying at the
vicarage at Otten Belchamp heard of my condi-
tion. She called at Mr. Goody’s, the medicine
dealer, and told him to supply me with some
Mother Siegel’s Curative Syrup and she would
pay for it. Very reluctantly I took the medi-
cine, for I had tried so many tilings without
obtaining any benefit. However, my wife pressed
me so hard that at last I began to take the Syrup.
After a few doses I said to my wife, 1 1 think 1
feel better for this medicine,' and from that time I
commenced to improve. By'the time I had taken
three bottles I was back at my work, as strong
and well as ever—much to the surprise of every-
body.
“ People all about said I would never get well,
but I did, thank the Lord.
“Now I tell everyone that Mother Seigel's
Syrup saved my life. I can now eat anything,
and feel so light-hearted I could jump over a five-
barred gate. My neighbours all say I look ten
years younger. ”
Elias Bland, shoemaker,
Belchamp St. Paul, Clare, Suffolk.
The doctors who attributed Mr. Bland’s illness
to indigestion and dyspepsia were quite right.
All they Jacked was the proper remedy. This
appeared in Mother Seigel’s Syrup, and now our
good friend enjoys his pipe as he. did in other
years. If he is ever handled in that way again wo
may wager he won’t forget what to do.

The late Pope Hennessy was a versatile
man, and in his time played many parts. He
was once concerned in a sensational incident
which will bear relating. During the Third
Empire a Mr. Dayton was the TJ.S. Minister to
France. This gentleman was epris of a certain
very charming and clever person, a Mrs. St. John
Ecoles, and was in the habit of visiting her fre-
quently at Meurice’s, where she lived in great
style. One evening, after a dinner or ball at the
Tuileries, Mr. Dayton called upon his inamorata,
and, fatigued, threw himself upon a sofa. After
sometime, the lady, wondering why he had slept
so soundly, tried to awaken him, when, to her
horror, she discovered that he was dead. Here
was a dramatic situation ! One can imagine her
feelings at thus finding herself alone face to face
with the corpse of her lover, who, only a few
minutes before, had appeared to be in robust
health. What was to be done? To call the
hotel people would be to raise a scandal, which
was the last thing she desired. Never surely
—off the stage—was a woman in such a posi-
tion. She was fairly racked with terror, when
she suddenly bethought herself of a young gentle-
man whom she had met at dinner a few nights
previously, and who had amused her very much
by his brilliant conversation. He was staying at
Meurice’s, so she determined to confide in him
and ask his assistance, Fortunately for her, he
was in his room, and, hearing- her story, he at
once offered to do what he could to help her out
of her difficulty. After cogitating for a while he
went out, and in a short time returned with some
men, who carried the body away. So quietly was
it done that no one in the hotel save the night-
porter, whom a few francs induced to hold Ins
tongue, had the least idea what was going on.
The young gentleman was Pope Hennessy, then
starting to carve his own fortune. It appears that
he went straight to the nearest commissaire of
Police, and representing himself as a medical
man, told him that the American Minister had
been suddenly seized with a fit at Meurice’s,
and it was absolutely necessary that he
should be at once taken home, but that
at that hour of the night it was impossible
to find people to carry him ; he, therefore, craved
the assistance of Monsieur la Commissaire. That
functionary was all politeness, and was, of course,
desirous to serve so distinguished a member of
the diplomatic corps, so he sent some of his men,
who transported the body to the. Minister’s house,
suspecting nothing, and little thinking that they
were carrying a cadavrc. And so, thanks to
Hennessy’s ready wit, a very grave scandal was
avoided. The next day, of course, the papers had
the startling news that the U.S. representative
had died suddenly in his house after returning
from the palace, and so the occurrence passed out
of memory. Whether Pope Hennessy confided in
the Commissaire, and told him the truth, only
those in the secret knew. It is certain, however,
that Hennessy earned the undying gratitude
of a somewhat remarkable and very pretty woman,
who had in those days considerable influence in
more than one quarter.

“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
T B e Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal ,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap) nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State, Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
Ihe direct_ election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.

be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
Ihe Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility.’)
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
mu has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
papier-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
.The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after-the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
pmblication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or lessjservile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress : it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the buslnhan of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest amt most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

A well-known Sydney lawyer tells the
story that he only advised a man to plead guilty
once during his career. It was the plainest case
of horse-stealing on record, and Mr. Lawyer got a
promise from the Crown that if the prisoner
pleaded guilty a heavy sentence would not be
pressed for. And—whisper it low -a promise was
wrung even from the Judge to that effect. A
couple of hours before the case came on the lawyer
saw his client, advised him to plead guilty, and
told him what he had done, “ Mr. So-and-So,”
said the man, “ I engaged you to defend me, and
I intend to plead not guilty.” An ingenious
defence was worked up on the spur of the moment,
and the jury brought in “Not Guilty” without
leaving the box.
Thus an Indian writer :
To the young married woman nothing is more delight’
ful than making fresh incursions into the realms of
bachelordom. Having already successfully proved her
powers of captivation, she desires again to test her
ability to enthral, and to discover whether she can sub-
jugate the susceptible heart of man. Therefore, she goes
forth mashing and to mash ; hut instinct tells her that
conquest will be made more easy if she poses as a single
maiden. To this end she removes the golden symbol of
the eternity of the marriage covenant, and, dangling her
glove in her hand, lays herself out for sport. Neither has
she long to wait before the fly is attracted to the honey-

This rapidly ripens into a flirtation, more or less pro-

he is quite a hero of the veni, vidi, vici description.
Castles in the air of the most magnificent proportion are

The recent Dudley wedding has set the
fashion for black hats. They are to be worn with
any coloured costume. Broad brims are to be the

Funerals. —During the week three funerals have taken
place in this district, all of which were conducted by Mr.
John White in his usual faultless style. The first was
that of the late Mrs. , and in connection with this
event we may mention that the coffin wks a real work of
art, being covered with thick velvet studded with brass
nails and furnished with costly brass mountings.

ADDRESS TO A LAME ASS.
(By a Bulletincer.)
Long-winded scrawler “on the Age,”
Traducer slow and solemn,
Who can’t express your spite and rage
In less than, say, a column—
Squat on the old Repentance stool
And listen, dunderheaded fool!
What chance have you with weakaouse
The public mind to bias
You yarn and yarn, but what’s the use,
Poor slave of “ Ananias ? ”
You’ll ne’er possess the pointed pen
That tickles up one’s fellow-men.
’Tis hard to have a bitter mind
Without a bit-ter style ;
To envy wit and still to find
You can’t provoke a smile ;
Ours, doubtless, is the very bin
You’d like to shoot your rubbish in.
Perhaps you tried it in the past
And were, sans thanks, “declined
You gnashed your teeth, but now at last
An open bin you find ;
Great Syme does not refuse your screed —
He thinks it very good indeed.
Stick strictly to the daily rags—
No other hope remains
For you, whose dreary “ copy ” drags,
And head is void of brains ;
Though, maybe, you may have the luck
To dabble in the Leader muck.
Write on. O person dull and dense,
And teach Australian youth
To ne’er expect much simple sense,
Or honesty, or truth,
In heavy journals, which they buy
Because they want the “latest”—lie.
Meanwhile The Bulletin will sow
The seed with tireless hand,
And where the Age can never go,
In many a distant land,
Will people read this little rhyme
That is so rough on you and Syme.
