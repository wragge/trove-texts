If ~W r FR hands are like the milk’s own white,
g "y Her lips like rose-leaves parted ;
M M But love is not in her eyes’ light,
Wherefore he goes sad-hearted.
Her hair is midway gold and brown,
Her eyes than skies are bluer ;
He might not kneel to kings, but doion
On his two knees he’d woo her.
In sweet suspense his soul doth move,
No* dying nor yet living :
For death in life or life with love
She holds 'within her giving.
If her blue eyes would light a while,
Her lips part just a minute,
Then, then for him God’s earth would smile,
God’ s flowers laugh outright in it.
Though all else fail and high stars fall,
Yet hope is left the lover ;
Some moment he may hear her call,
His love her love discover.
R.Q.
“When this cruel war is over” in the Com-
monwealth Parliament, the humble Australian
author pleads for consideration by his country.
Copyright law in Australia is literally at sixes
and sevens, for there are six kinds of copyright
in the six States, and a controlling seventh
is provided by British statute law and common
law. Practically the six sets of copyright condi-
tions are on the same plane of inadequacy ; and
the crying need of the British law for revision and
codification has been admitted for many* a year.
Copyright is one of the matters reserved by the
Constitution Act for the Federal Parliament ;
and, now that onr literary tribe is increasing, the
sooner the law is placed on a definite basis the
better it will be for Australian literature and
Australian industry.
J*
The theory of copyright declares that an author
who writes a book is entitled to reap the com-
mercial profit of his book, and that a man
should be protected from theft of the work of his
brain just as he is protected from theft of the
work of his hands. To books, as subjects of copy-
right, are added pictures, drawings and photo-
graphs, works of sculpture, works of music, designs
for industrial use—everything of which copies
may be multiplied to profit, and that does not
fall in the different though kindred class of inven-
tions similarly to be protected by patent.
The form of British copyright law has grown in
a confused and haphazard fashion through cen-
turies, and the law we have in Australia is based
on the British Act of 1842—a landmark in copy-
right history. This Act, however, has been varied
or extended from time to time, and some of the
changes have been followed by some of the States.
Others, by others, have not. N.S. Wales law, for
example, falls nearly as far short of British law
as British law falls short of the attainable ideal.
Some English writers have contended that
copyright should be perpetual: that a man who
makes a book in his own time, with his own tools
and materials, should own it as another man owns
a house that he builds in his own time, with his
own tools and materials. The cases, however, are
not precisely kin ; and in any event the accepted
term of forty-two years satisfies most people. What
we want is a clear statement of the principle and a
dear provision for the hundred details that the
modern practice of the arts has brought to light.
Where the literary art touches the underlying
industries, the example of Canada should be
followed. Canadian law endeavours to create
a local literature and establish local industries
without seriously impeding the ingress of worthy
foreign literature. The Revised Statutes of 1886
impose a duty of 15 per cent, ad valorem, with
some exceptions, upon books that have been
printed less than seven years at date of importa-
tion. There is an additional duty of 12J per cent.
ad valorem upon reprints of British copyright
books not copyrighted in Canada. Reprints of
Canadian copyright books, or of British copyright
books copyrighted also in Canada, are prohibited
to be imported.
' To secure copyright, Canadian law provides
that foreign works must be printed and pub-
lished or reprinted and republished in Canada.
This obliges British publishers to send to Canada
stereotype plates of books they desire to copy-
right. It is a condition that p.rofits Canada with-
out in practice causing any great hardship or
difficulty to the foreigner. The reprinting and
republication must take place within one month
after production or publication elsewhere.
TJ.S. law provides that a book, to secure copy-
right, must be printed from type set in the
U.S.A. and published in the U.S.A. at least
contemporaneously with publication elsewhere.
This is a better provision for the Austra-
lian printing trades to strive for; and it gives
obvious advantages to Australian readers.
In the event of a foreign book, subject of copy-
right, not being copyrighted, Canadian law pro-
vides that any person domiciled in Canada may
obtain from the Canadian copyright authority a
not-exclusive license to reprint it, if the licensee
agrees to pay a ten per cent, royalty to the author
or his assigns. Further, if the Canadian demand
for such a copyright book is not met, a similar
license, with a similar condition, may be granted.
j*
The general effect of the Canadian law is to
encourage the local author and his dependent
industries while assisting readers-to get the best
new books most speedily and on the best terms.
The book shops in Toronto, for example, are
superior to the book shops in Sydney or Mel-
bourne. Canadians have the sense to recognise
that Canadian interests should come first. Aus-
tralians should imitate them as regards Australia.
Therefore the Common-
wealth Parlianien tshouLi
enact a copyright law
that will tend to keep
and increase the art, the
brains, the trade, and
the money in the Com-
monwealth.
In a matter tried be-
fore N.S.W. Full Gourt
on Miv 20, Justices
Owen and Pring actually
declared that “the case
was too clear for argu-
ment” ! Fortunately the
reputation of the Bench
was saved by a demurrer
from Justice Simpson.
But that two judges of
three should lay an axe
to the root of legal
radition ! —do we sleep?
do we dream ? As if any-
thing in the world were
too clear for argument,
let alone legal argument!
Even mathematics are
not “too clear for argu-
ment.” “Don’t try to
convince me,’’ once said
an English judge to coun-
sel, “that two and two
are not four. The ques-
tion,” added his pro-
phetic soul, “is too clear'
for argument.” And
counsel retorted, “Never-
theless I should not
despair of convincing your lordship that in proper
juxtaposition two and two would be twenty-two.”
“A case too clear for argument!” This to
denizens of a universe of doubt, from the instru-
ments of a science of cavil! And George Reid
was declaring contemporaneously that the older
he grew, the more he grew uncertain : he expected
to end as a forlorn interrogation-point in a wilder-
ness of dubiety!
“ Bush Doctor ” writes—
As to “ A Doctor’s Confessions.” Of course Yeresaeff
mistook his vocation. He lacks one great quality in a
physician—courage. And he made the elementary error
of studying diseases, not patients. As if any man could
catalogue in his head the signs and symptoms of some
twelve hundred diseases ! And the catalogue would be
of little use to him if he succeeded.
Veresaeff takes himself to task for making a mistake.
Well, the man who never makes mistakes is the man
who never makes anything. The history of mankind is
a history of making mistakes and paying the penalty.
[There is some natural professional confusion
here. The complainant urged that the doctor
made the mistake, and the patient paid the
penalty.]
Veresaeff again shows himself a coward when he gives
salves, pills, and powders to those who can receive no
benefit from them. Why does he not tell the washer-
woman to keep her hands dry, the drayman not to lift,
the weaver to keep from dust; and explain that if these
conditions cannot be fulfilled all treatment is useless?
It is not his fault.
You truly say that surgery is a science. Surgery is a
handicraft. Surgeon—chirurgeon—hand-worker. Man
can wound and Nature will heal. The advance of surgery
is due to the hand, by practice, being able to wound more
delicately, precisely as the wood-carver improves. But
it is Nature that heals the wound. The surgeon has no
share in that part of the process. He can keep dirt out,
but that is all he can do. He is an artist. *
Yeresaeff urges that “Clinical observation is unstable
and deceiving.” It all depends upon who is the observer.
A sneer at Koch’s tuberculin ! It is well known that
Koch never said it would cure consumption. His hand
was forced two years before he was ready. At any rate,
it put us on the track of diphtheria anti-toxin.
The “diagnostic instinct.” There is no such thing.
The diagnostic instinct is simply the power of quick and
accurate observation laboriously acquired, the collection
of evidence by means of the five senses and the deduc-
tion therefrom of a logical conclusion. And this power
can be acquired—doubtless more easily by some than by
others; but the acquisition is not beyond the scope of
the average intellect.
Medicine will become a science, single, universal and
infallible, when all patients are turned in the same
lathe. Until then it will remain the “ art of treating the
sick "—not the sickness.

Grant Allen’s account of Spencer, printed in
The Forum, refers to hia habit of conversational
generalisation. “If you remarked it was a fine
day, Spencer would answer: ‘Yes; anti-cyclonic
conditions like those of yesterday seldom break
up without warning of the advent of a depression
from westward.’ If you observed that Mrs. Jones
was a pretty woman, Spencer would reply : ‘ Her
father was a West Highlander, and her mother an
Irishwoman ; and intermarriage between High-
landers and Irish almost always produces physi-
cally handsome but intellectually inferior chil-
dren. ’” Spencer never married—luckily for him-
self and Her.
“ However much, physically, about town a
woman may be,” writes G. K. Chesterton, “she
still models herself on nature ; she tries to carry
nature with her ; she bids grasses to grow on her
head, and furry beasts to bite her about the
throat. In the heart of a dim ci+y, she models her
hat on a flaring cottage garden of flowers. We,
with our nobler civic sentiment, model ours on a
chimney-pot—the ensign of civilisation.”
MAP OF THE MULISH IGNORANCE
OF N.S.W. EDUCATION DEPARTMENT.
The above maps, purporting to show the rail-
way system of Queensland, are given (in reduced
size) to illustrate the way in which a bureaucracy
will blunder. Map A, issued by N.S.W. Railway
Commissioners, correctly shows Queensland rail-
way lines. Map B is one of several inaccurate
maps appearing in N.S.W. Education Dept.’s
official History of the Australian Colonies, com-
piled by Joseph Finney, 8.A., printed by N.S.W.
Govt. Printer, and “ published by authority.”
Two and a half years ago attention was here
drawn to the grotesque errors of Map B. N.S.W.
Education Department, however, continues to
issue the book and the map for use by children in
N.S.W. State schools; and continues to add its
official imprimatur to the plain demonstration of
its ignorance.
Observe that in the departmental Map B the
Cairns railway does not exist, its place being taken
by an imaginary extension of the Cooktown line.
Observe that the Northern railway is cut off short
at Hughenden, instead of being continued to
Winton. Observe that the extension of the
Southern line to Cunnamulla is tacked on to the
Central line, and proceeds south from Longreach
across the Barcoo 2 Other deficiencies are not
stressed.
This blundering map is a typical illustration of
a blundering book that (not wholly by the com-
piler’s fault) is sold as a curiosity of official
incapacity. The fact that it is still sold to mis-
lead the children whom N.S.W. Education Dept,
is supposed to instruct, is a commonplace of
official obstinacy.

The Forest Flora of N.S. Wales, part viii, by
J., H. Maiden (N.S.W. Govt. Printer; Is.). As
previously noted, this series endeavours to collect
all the botanical and industrial knowledge avail-
able regarding N.S.W. trees. The new part con-
siders white honeysuckle, white or gr§y ironbark,
barklya syringifolia, and rhodosphsera rhodan-
therna (a yellow-wood). From the honeysuckle-
flowers our aboriginal predecessors used to make a
palatable and perhaps mildly intoxicating drink
called bool —whence doubtless the familiar Bulletin.
The leaves and flowers of the trees are figured in a
set of original plates; and anyone interested in
our timbers will find this inexpensive publication
valuable.
Revue Economxque Internationale, No. 1 (Lond.„
P. S. King; sfr.). Heavy artillery of economic
science, here reverberating faintly. Serious
students, if they exist in Australia, may whet
their brains on this magazine. In style it is French,
in solidity German : the French being in matters
of science scarcely less thorough than the Germans,
but much more interesting. The first number con
siders the evolution of French economic doctrine
(Levasseur) and the question of the English tariff
(with a summary, by G. Schmoller, of the history
of similar economic crises); and deals at lesser
length with current matters financial, industrial,
and scientific in their relation to economics. Sir
Vincent Oaillard writes approvingly of preferen-
tial trade, with a smooth Australian reference
that contains a false implication. “ The colonies
have headed the movement. Canada has imposed
preferential duties, etc. South Africa has followed
her example. Australasia does not lag behind.
From all sides comes to us the same appeal,
and the mother-country should respond to it.”
This is Janus Chamberlain’s familiar sophistry:
with one mouth lie urges “ the colonies ” to answer
the appeal of Britain ; with the other he urges
Britain to answer the appeal of the colonies.
Australia, at least, has made no appeal, and cer-
tainly does “ lag behind.”
0. D. Pearson writes in Among the Garden People
(Lond., Murray ; 55.) a children’s equivalent of “ Familiar
Animals I Have Met.” The book is uninspired woman’s
work, and too American to be profitable here. We want
to hit our children where they live with a ’possum, not
with a chipmunk. The three-colour illustrations by F.
C. Gordon are well conceived in the Amer. decorative
mode, and well printed.

In My Friend Prospero Henry Harland, Ameri-
can in all but the accident of birth, refers to the
blot on the local scutcheon.
John laughed. “I adore,” he said, “ our light and
airv British way of tarring Americans and Australians
with the same brush, —the descendants of transported
convicts and the descendants of the Pilgrim Fathers.”
Thus, as to America, the washings of all the slums
and ghettos, of Christendom and Jewry, of all the
gaols of Europe, are inferentially the children of
conscience who left England for their souls’ sake.
Fancy Boss Tweed and the hosts of Tammany,
fancy mongrel Chicago, claiming a direct descent
from Miles Standish !
Nor is that the worst —America also was
peopled with British convicts. Bancroft, the
American historian, has said : “ The history
of our [American] colonisation is the- his-
tory of the crimes of Europe.” Transporta-
tion to the American plantations became a
common sentence in the English Criminal
Courts about the time of the Restoration,
16J0. Even in Bacon’s days the practice was
common, and my Lord of Verulam, referring to
Virginia, wrote that it was “ a shameful and un-
blessed thing to take the scum of people and
wicked, condemned men to be the people with
whom you plant,” Bacon was a shareholder in
the trading company formed by London merchants
and others for the purpose of colonising Virginia,
which company sent out in 1608 nine ships with
500 settlers aboard, who, says Doyle in his
history of America, “were for the most part the
very scum of the earth—men sent out to the New
World because they were unfit to live in the Old.”
Doyle says elsewhere, “ Most of the colonists
were no better than criminals ; indeed, the colony
had got so evil a name in England that few re-
spectable men would go out.” Said Daniel
De Foe, “ America has been made the very
common sewer and dungyard to Britain.” From
1650 to 1775 transportation to the American
plantations was the vile alternative to the halter.
According to an official estimate written in 1787,
the average annual number transported during
the seven years from 1769 to 1775 was about 1100.
If the average number be taken at 1000 through-
out the whole period the result would be a total
of 120,000—an estimate probably within the mark,
because it takes no account of the large numbers
who were sent out for political offences after the
rebellions of 1685, 1715, and 1745. Nor does it
take any account of offenders who were allowed
to transport, themselves—a privilege frequently
granted in the case of men arrested on suspicion
but not brought to trial, as well as in cases of
conviction. Lord Auckland estimated the con-
victs sent to America at 2000 per annum—an
estimate probably over the mark.
Australia received from England, Ireland, and
other British colonies and possessions, perhaps
about 60,000 convicts —all told. The number
indentured from the First Fleet to the rejection
of the “ Hashemy’s ” human cargo was 83,290;
but the mortality on board the transports was
something frightful. Moreover, many were
sentenced to transportation to Australia who were
afterwards reprieved, or who died on the hulks in
the Thames, or who were transferred to local
British prisons.

TO TELL*. ♦
YOU ABOUT
THIS BELT.
We want to talk to every man and woman who may have a weakness, who are
run down physically, who realise that the old “ fire ” and energy that they once had has
gone ; men and women who can’t stand the amount of exertion they could once ; and
those who suffer from torturing pains and aches of the body or limbs. We want to talk
to you, and tell you what can be done in your case. We want to show you just exactly
what we have done for others ; what amount of benefit has been given to thousands of
sufferers from WEAKNESS, LASSITUDE, NERVOUSNESS, INDIGESTION,
DYSPEPSIA, CONSTIPATION, RHEUMATISM, SCIATICA, LUMBAGO, INSOMNIA, DIABETES, VARICOCELE, and ALL
LIVER and KIDNEY TROUBLES. We want to explain about this great remedy—
Dr. MCLAUGHLIN’S ELECTRIC BELT
The grandest invention of the age for weak men; the surest and easiest cure for all nervous and chronic diseases. Its wonderful powei is
directed to the seat of the nervous system, through which its vitalising strength penetrates into all parts of the body, carrying new le o
every function which has been weakened by dissipation, restoring energy to the brain and power to the vital oigans. o w ea man, no
sickly or delicate woman, will ever regret a fair trial of the Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt, which is Natuies Restorei o lal y. wi
cure Varicocele and all Weakness in Men and Women. _ _ ± . , . ■.
There is nothing else like it. It stands years ahead of the Medical Age. We have treated hundreds of thousands of cases, and
cured them, during the past twenty years. We know our ability.
Sciatica and Lame Back.
Myingrong, DARLINGTON, Vic.
Dear Sirs, —For several years I was a sufferer from Sciatica and Lame Back,
often the pains were so great that I had to leave off work. I had been to four
doctors but they could do me no good ; in fact, each one treated me for a different
complaint, and the last one said he could not cure me. I often read in the papers
about your Electric Belts, and I thought I would try one. After wearing it for
about three months my pains left me, and have never troubled me since. I can say
to any man that, since wearing your Belt, I have never felt any pain at all. You
may make what use you like of this letter, as I am well known about this part, or
you can send anyone to me, and I will tell them of the great benefits I have received
from your Electric Belt. I remain, yours faithfully,
H. McMAHON.
Rheumatism and Congestion of the Kidneys.
Neotsfield, SINGLETON, N.S.W.
Gentleman, —I was suffering with acute Rheumatism, and, latterly, Congestion
of the Kidneys, for about ten years. I have been under a number of Doctors both
in the country and in Sydney, but got absolutely no relief from any of them.
Happily I finally tried your Electric Belt, with the result that I speedily got relief,
and in less than six months I was:absolutely free from all pain, had gamed weight,
and considered myself cured. In proof of the cure I may say that it is now eighteen
months since I left off wearing the Belt regularly, during which time I have been
and am a perfectly well man, in the enjoyment of perfect health and vigor, and
never felt better in nty life. I now send you this for the benefit of others suffering
as I did before I was fortunate enough to get your Wonderful Belt
Gratefully yours, VVM. 1 K UJN JDExL-

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Written in Hope.
I’ve cut the poles and stripped the bark,
And worked like any nigger,
From morning jackass till the dark
The daylight did disfigure.
I’ve got the bark hut finished now,
And wait the wife and kiddies,
With hope that goes as high, I vow,
As Cheops’ pyramid is !
I’ve always held in simple things
Man’s truest chance of bliss is—
The morning song some bush bird sings,
A loving woman’s kisses.
And here, upon a murky night,
When hushed are all day’s songsters,
I’m dreaming by the hut fire’s light
Of all I’ll teach the youngsters.
For those that like the city best,
The city, sure, suffices—
But there I’m burdened and oppressed,
And me it ne’er entices.
But grand old gums and tangled vines,
The gullies, creeks, and mosses,
To me are soothing anodynes
For life’s severest losses.
And, oh ! I’ll teach the youngsters lore
That city folk scarce hear off;
They’ll love the bush still more and more,
No mood of hers have fear of.
They’ll know where each bird builds its nest,
Where bandicoots go hiding,
Where ’possums and where squirrels rest
When day’s departure biding.
They’ll love all bird songs, gay and grave—
The thrush’s merry singing,
The coachman’s ventriloquial stave,
The bell-bird’s chimes sweet ringing;
The butcher-bird’s clear morning call,
The kookaburra’s greeting,
His last farewell from gum trees tall
When evening shades are meeting.
So here upon a murky night,
When hushed are all day’s songsters,
I dream my dream—a fancy bright
Of all I’ll teach the youngsters.
And, oh ! may nothing interfere—
Delay, or dread disaster—■
God send the missus quickly here !
God speed the youngsters faster !

The Swamp Oaks.
All day the wind has been south-east,
The leaden clouds drift low ;
A choppy sea has swept the bay
Throughout the ebb and flow.
Across the bar the ocean breaks
On sand patch, rock, and stone,
And where the gully meets the beach
I hear the swamp oaks moan.
The flying rain has swept the hills,
The muddy streams run fast ;
Adown the tracks we drive the cows
When milking time is past.
A timber ketch with hatches on
Rides in the bay alone,
At ev’ry gust she strains and creaks,
And all the swamp oaks moan.
I almost love to hear the sound
That speaks so mournfully,
When wind and rain are in the bay
And night is on the sea.
And when o’erhead the curlew cries
In almost human tone,
A voice I think I understand
Is in the swamp oaks’ moan.

HUGH S.OHK
The Laughing Jackass.
When daylight dawns and the night is done
In the heart of the upland wold,
When the first bright beams of the rising sun
Are tipping the hills with gold—
’Tis then will ring from far and near
His song-note loud and gay—
The little gray bird whose laugh is heard
Bidding the bush “ Good-day !”
When the sun climbs up to the breakfast hour
And rouses the swagman lone,
To find that the ’possum has filched his flour,
The dingo his mutton bone,
It’s safe to say our friend in gray
Is voicing his humor grim,
For his dearest delight is the bushman’s plight:
Such things are a joy to him.
When deep in the heart of the pathless scrub
Some fellow has lost his way,
Or down in the creek with a broken hub
The waggoner toils all day—•
You take my word, that small gray bird
On top of some neighboring tree
Is shaking the woods with his mirthful moods :
“What a jolly good joke !” says he.
So morn to morn, from the tall tree-top,
This humorist gray will go.
Whenever a man’s in a fix he’ll stop
And laugh at the joke—ha ho !
And when night comes in the leafy gums
He’ll hide himself from view,
To dream of snakes till the morning breaks,
As most of us sometimes do.

with Winchester “ New Rival ”in any way; while Winches-

The Miseries Caused
by a Torpid Liver.
The Only Safe Remedy Effects
a Perfect Cure.
The Case of Mrs. M. HICKEY.
(by a special reporter.)
There is much profound and important
wisdom in that old proverb where it is said
—“ The heart knoweth its own bitterness.”
It forms part of a truth still moi’e compre-
hensive— that every man knows his own
peculiar feelings, and difficulties, and trials
far better than l.e can get any of his
neighbours to perceive them, although in an
effort to convey such impressions to other
minds lately made by Mrs. Marian Hickey,
of No. 3 West-street, Paddington, the
subject dealt with was so clearly described
that no trouble should be experienced in
understanding her story.
“For several weeks,” said Mrs. Hicicty,
“I had been feeling rather unwell, but
there was no particular cause for alarm
until one day I took a bad turn whilst doing
my work. Such a horriblo feeling of faint-
ness came over me that I said I would see a
doctor, and so I did.”
“Did the doctor tell you what was
wrong ? ”
“ Ho said it was my liver and kidneys
which were causing the trouble, and that
the medicine which he prescribed was the
best thing I could have for my complaint,
but my sufferings, instead of getting less,
became fifty times worse than ever ; so after
taking that medicine a while I thought I
had better hasten to another doctor and see
if he could bring me any relief. For a day
or two I was slightly easier, then the medi-
cine had no effect upon me, and I drifted
to the lowest depths of wretchedness.
Even then I did not lose heart altogether,
for I consulted another physician, and then
another, and so on till I could see it was no
use going to any more. My courage failed
me after all those bitter experiences, and I
thought my only chance would be simply a
matter of luck. If I could .but get a good
physic amongst all those that were
advertised I might yet be relieved, I
thought; but after trying almost everything
procurable I was in a hopeless predica-
ment.”
“ Aro you sure you did not receive some
benefit from all those medicines 2 ”
“ None whatever. They made me worse,
for I became as helpless as a child. Yes,
twelve years ago I lost the use of my limbs.
Why, I could not put my hands to my head
to do my hair, and for five months I could !
not walk except by the aid of sticks and
with some one to help mo along. Oh ! it
was terrible ; and to think that I was not
going to see my children grow up was a
source of constant anguish. I had given up
all hope of recovering, and felt as sure as I am
that I am sitting here that I would never
get better, and if you had seen me you
would have thought the same. You never
saw such a sight as I was —not a morsel of
flesh on my bones (I was as thin as a wafer),
and my cheeks quite sunken. With my
darkened complexion as well, I am sure I
looked the picture of death. I was awfully
nervous, too, for I used to jump up in the
middle of the night and fancy that some-
body was killing me, and if I had been able
to walk I would not have crossed the street,
as if anybody came near me my limbs shook
like the branches of a tree. There was no
peace in life for me, and I was so melancholy
with the thought that I was dying that I
resigned myself to my fate. Heavy pains
in the chest gave me such a horrible choking
sensation that I was afraid to lie down, and
I had to be propped up in my chair because
of the excruciating pain 3 in my side and
back, between my shoulders the pain was
so severe that I used to have a lotion rubbed
in ; bub that did not ease them, and the
piercing paiii3 at the top and back of my
head nearly drove me frantic. My eyes felt
is if they were not properly opened, the
sight also being very bad, and if I washed
my mouth out a dozen times a day, it made
no difference to the bitter taste that was
there. I had no appetito for food, and
what little I was obliged to take gave me
violent pains in the stomach, which seemed
to be tied in a knot. When those teirib e
cramps came on I used to think, ‘ Oh, deaf, I
am going to expire I’but even death would not
come to my relief. Soon afterwards, how-
ever, the food came up again, and it was
that coustant vomiting which made me : s
weak as a kitten. Giddiness and palpita-
tion came with the least movement, at.d I
felt so feeble that I knew 'wegs of
life would soon Le exhausted.”
“ Unless you received relief you mean ?
“I did not look for help, because I
thought I was past all worldly aid ; but, to
please a friend who came to sea
comented to try a bottle of Clements Tonic.
When that was emptied she insisted on me
taking more, and in a fortnight I really felt
the better for it. Something seemed to
whisper that I should persevere w ith
Clements Tonic, and, helpless and crippled
as I was, a new hope sprang up, became
Clements Tonic was stopping the fits of
vomiting, and I was sleeping well already.
Restlessness at nights had been one of my
greatest trials, but under Clements Tonic
I could soon sleep without
dreams occurring to upset me. Then tha
dreadful chest and stomach pains started to
decrease, and my headaches were less
frequent. For a time I could hardly realise
that I was being rescued, but when a good
appetite appeared and my food stayed down
1 egularly, 1 almost jumped with joy at the
knowledge that I was saved. For twelve
months I had suffered unspea! able torture
and misery, and these who had seen me
tottering on the brink of the grave were
amazed at the wonderful power of Cldments
Tonic, which cleared away the pains in my
side and shoulders, and drove the aching
sensations from my limbs, the use of which
I acquired by degrees. To be able to mix
with the outside world after despairing of
ever seeing it again is what I have to thank
Clements Tonic for, and I am sure I would
have been dead long ago only for that medi-
cine. The strengthening effects of Clements
Tonic were shown by the way I could go
about my work, as in a few weeks I was as
brisk and active as ever, and with as much
happiness in life as I enjoyed before being
afflicted with that terrible sense of nervous
depression which nothing but Clements
Tonic could eradicate. The symptoms of
kidney disease were banished simultaneously
with my liver disorders, and they were ill
removed so effectively that for nearly eleven
years I have been blessed with the very, best
of health. That is why I advise all my
friends to take Clements Tonic when they
are ill, and nothing pleases me more than
this interview, every word of which you
can publish in any form you like. ’

RUPTURE
FREE CURE.
Wonderful Home Treatment that Cures
Without Pain or Loss of Time.
Dr. W. S. Rice (Dept. 1317), 8 & 9. Stonecutter
Street, London, E.C., has invented a method that
cures rupture without pain, danger, operation, or
an hour’s loss of time from the day’s work, lo
avoid all questions of doubt, he
sends free to every sufferer a
free trial of his method, and
there can be no earthly reason
why anyone,rich orpoor, should
not avail themselves of this
generous offer. As an instance
of this remarkable method,
the cure of Mr. J. J. Hogan,
Cobar, N.S.W., is well worth
noticing. H© was cured at tli©
age of 70 years, after suffering
10 years. He made an affidavit
to this effect, of his own free
Mr, A. Dochekty. w jii t before two J.P’s.
Mr J. Eubank, a farmer of Yarloop, Western
Australia, was curedafter years from
a scrotal rupture. Mrs. F. Medley, 177, blurt
cjfrAAt "Rnllarat Victoria, Australia, was cured
afto suffering 5 years Mi. A. Docherty, 23 War-
wick Ifeet, lirkenhead, Cheshire, England, was
cured of an irreducible scrotal rupture—one of the
wmst kinds known. No treatment he had used
would enable him to return the rupture to its
proper place. He tried the method of Dr. Rice,
which not only reduced the rupture, but also
effected its complete cure, and he is now . aB S 0
as a bell. 1 A full description and sample of this
remarkable method of cure will be g sent
upon application. It has cured thousand. «Do not
hesitate to give it a trial. Write at once—to-day.

THURSDAY, JUNE 2, 1904.
THE LOAN N.S.W. DIDN’T GET.
The hopelessness and rottenness of the present
political generation in Australia was conspicuously
manifested in a small discussion which recently
cropped up in the Sydney press. It had its un-
seemly beginnings in the news that Japan had got
into debt—in the news that there was some
money left on earth which this country hadn’t
borrowed, and the Jap had borrowed it.
A Japanese loan of £10,000,000 was recently
floated in Europe at the astounding and
outrageous, not to say ruinous, interest rate of
over 6J per cent. The interest rate was so enor-
mous that it brought a rush of offers, and straight-
way a frantic correspondence broke out on the
question : “Why can’t we borrow like this ? ” In
a general way it might be assumed that the reason
was fairly obvious—obvious enough for anybody to
understand. Australia can’t borrow like this partly
because it doesn’t offer 6£ per cent, interest. There
are depths to which even the worst Australian
Government does not descend, and the depth that
Japan has reached in this matter is one of them.
If any Australian State offered 6| per cent, for a
£10,000,000 loan it might—or it might not—also be
offered £300,000,000 by Stock Exchange gamblers
who regarded the security as very doubtful, but
who knew it looked attractive enough to be profit-
ably jobbed out to widows with a little money and
elderly clergymen with not too much sense. But
even assuming that Australia couldn’t borrow a
heap more money—which isn’t proved—if it got
down to the Japanese level of per cent., there
is a very good reason why it couldn’t. Japan
owes a public debt of about £llos. per inhabitant,
and the Government has reproductive works to
show for practically the full amount. Australia
owes some £5B or £6O per inhabitant, of which £l2
per inhabitant is represented by no productive
assets at all, and the other £4B is represented by
allegedly productive works which are so unpro-
ductive that they only pay interest on about
£3O. Australia has, in proportion to its
population, the largest debt on earth ; the largest
debt in the world’s history; a debt such as no
country on earth ever before carried without
going bankrupt; also a debt which may yet make
Australia bankrupt.
* * * *
Even these reasons, sufficient as they look, are
not the only causes for our inability to borrow
as largely as Japan—assuming that we couldn’t do
so even if we offered the same terms. As a rule
the six States of the Commonwealth average
among them four deficits per annum. Taken in
the aggregate, they have now a deficit almost
every year. The fact that we have a great public
estate is often quoted as making things better, but
it really makes them a vast deal worse; if we
can’t pay our way now while loans are still
coming in to some extent, and while the public
ESTATE IS BEING SOLD AND THE PROCEEDS SPENT AS
REVENUE, WHAT EARTHLY PROSPECT IS THERE OF
Cohen getting his interest when the saleable
PART OF THE PUBLIC ESTATE—NOT A VERY LARGE
ITEM NOW—IS ALL GONE, AND THIS LARGE SOURCE
OF REVENUE IS CUT OFF, AND OUR DEBT IS EVEN
greater than it is at present? Then, again, there
is no serious attempt under the existing feeble
tariff to build up industries which will enable the
people to live by profitable labor, instead of being
largely supported on useless or semi-useless loan
works which are really pauper relief. There is no
serious attempt to keep faith with the public
creditor in the matter of sinking funds ; a Turner
promises him a sinking fund to-day, and'an Irvine
steals the money to-morrow and spends it to save
levying a land-tax. And almost every paper and
politician in Australia talks as if borrowing-
indefinite endless borrowing, with no mention
of repayment between now and Judgment
Bay—was the natural condition of Australia.
Barring that one honest institution, the Labor
Government of the Commonwealth and its
minority, there isn’t an avowedly and perma-
nently non-borrowing party in Australian
politics, and the bulk of the Australian press
lays it down as the fiist duty of every other
Federal party to sacrifice any principle that stands
m the way, and drive the non-borrowing Govern-
ment out of office instantly. The existence, even
for a day, of Watson’s non-borrowing Government
is said to be an outrage on all constitutional prin-
ciples. Apart from the Watson Government
and its minority, every “Reform” party de-
nounces the extravagance of the other party
because it has damaged our credit in London, and
made it impossible to borrow large sums on reason-
able terms. It is difficult to find a single speech in
which the demand for economy is not based on the
fact that it is necessary in order to restore our
credit in London and enable us to borrow. The
loan disease, the cadging leprosy, the belief in
debt and more debt and still more debt as the
whole science of government, the mental paralysis
which believes that everything should naturally
begin with an I O U and naturally end with
a shortage, has eaten into Australia as it
never ate into any country before. In this
community, if Government No. 1 heaps up a long
series of deficits aggregating £2,000,000 or so, and
Government No. 2 pans out in one year a surplus
of £40,000, every one says that “ the finances have
been restored.” Then some taxes are taken off, and
the old deficit is hung up indefinitely. It generally
ends by disappearing into the mass of the general
debt after the public has got tired of seeing its
remains dangling from the nail.
* * * *
Nevertheless—to return to the original subject
—the “success” of the Japanese loan —the awful
“ success ” which consists in raising money at 6 \
per cent. —roused a very considerable blast of
energy hereabouts. There were many burning
letters about it in the press, and many devastating
leading articles, and, with hardly an exception,
both letters and articles began by assuming these
things as too obvious to be worth proving or even
mentioning:—
(1) That it is our duty to borrow money, to be always
borrowing money, to borrow money indefinitely.
(2) That it is our natural condition to borrow money.
(3) That even though we have already the biggest debt
on earth in proportion to population, and though very
much of that debt represents money spent as revenue,
and the rest is sunk in works which don’t anything like
pay interest—and even if there are no new works in sight
that we could invest more borrowed money in with any
prospect of them paying interest, these facts make no
difference in our clear duty, which is to borrow money.
(4) That as we haven’t floated a loan for the last month
or two we are obviously in an unnatural condition.
(5) That we do well to be angry—even frantic—when
we see another country borrowing money, no matter if it
is borrowing at 6£ per cent.—-when we are not borrowing-
money.
(6) That it is our duty to find out and eradicate the
malign influence now at work which prevents us borrow-
ing money, it being quite plain that the cause doesn’t
lie in the fact that we have already the biggest debt per
head on earth, and that our purely unproductive debt
(built up in 50 years, by a country with no big wars to pay
for, no army or navy worth mentioning to support, and
with the grandest land revenue on earth to spend) is more
per head than the whole debt of three-fourths of the other
civilised countries of the world.
(7) That when we have “ reformed ” we will be able to
get further into debt at once, and continue doing so as
long as we keep “reformed,” the sole purpose of “re-
form ” being to enable us to borrow more money.
On this basis there was a very general agreement
that the N.S.W. Arbitration Act, which only
applies to one State, is the great cause why Aus-
tralia isn’t violently borrowing money just at
pr esent. Also, there was a very general consensus
of opinion that it was because the See-Owe’Sulli-
VAN Government had already borrowed too much
money that N.S.W. isn’t borrowing money just
now. Therefore it was held to be the duty of
every good Cornstalk citizen to help Carruthers
into power, in order to restore confidence and to
enable N.S.W. to immediately borrow a lot more
money in addition to the excessive amount of
money which the existing Government has
borrowed already. As Sydney Evening News
put it, at the end of an article the sentiment of
which was a disgrace to Australian manliness :
Thus it is thought, taking all these factors into con-
sideration, that no surprise need he felt at Australia’s
being left financially out of the running, and Japan being
placed in that respect under the heading of “ most
favored nation.” TO REGAIN OUR ASCENDENCY OF
BORROWING POWER our Governments, Federal and
State alike, will have to turn over a new leaf, or rather
begin a new volume, Math, on its title page, the in-
scriptions : “ Moderation, Economy, Stability,” writ very
large and prominent.
* * * *
If Australia is to “reform” simply for the pur-
pose of borrowing more money, then it will be
much more reformed if it remains unreformed.
The proposed “reform ” is a mere confidence trick
which it is proposed to play on our very weary
uncle in London, and we have had more than
enough of confidence tricks. It is a noble thing to
reform because it is the right course to adopt; but
to reform merely to mollify uncle is a base and
crawlsome hypocrisy. Yet there is not at present
one prominent politician in Australia, outside
Premier Watson’s little following, who advocates
reform except on the ground that it will “ re-estab-
lish our borrowing powers,” or “restore our credit
in the London market.” The fact which finds most
difficulty in getting even a hearing is that any
Australian State can “restore its credit in Lon-
don” at the shortest notice by passing three
simple Acts to this effect: —
(1) That no more loans shall be floated, except for
renewal purposes.
(2) That every renewal loan shall carry a sinking fund,
to be provided solely out of revenue.
(3) That a sufficient amount shall be provided yearly
out of revenue to construct new public works.
That sort of thing would certainly make a real im-
pression on Cohen of London, but nothing else is
likely to do much in that way. Cohen probably
sees the Australian papers pretty regularly. He
reads in them that Australian State politics are
now mostly a row between two muddy tatterde-
malions, each declaring that he is the best man to
persuade Cohen to part with more money, and
that his rags will make the best impression on
Cohen when he calls round with the I O U. He
sees legislation degenerating into a screaming
match among silly politicians and painfully
conventional editors, who quarrel as to whether
the repeal of this Act will induce Cohen
to lend more money or the passing of that one
will cause him to lend less. Australian State
politicians and journalists represent Pecksniff
and his relations debating as to the most
effective method of greasing their rich rela-
tion, old Martin Chuzzlewit ; or a gathering of
deadbeats discussing the best mode of approaching
the station cook for rations, and trying to decide
which is the most plausible deadbeat to send
round to the kitchen door. And among the Tory
section which commands the bulk of the news-
papers there is a beautiful unanimity to the effect
that the trouble doesn’t lie in the fact that
Australia has already the Biggest Debt on Earth
in proportion to population and that its credit must
end somewhere. It is solid on the fact that there
must be some knob we can touch, or some law we
can repeal, or some person we can kick, whereby
we will mollify uncle, and be enabled to resume
borrowing, and keep at it indefinitely without ever
repaying anything. And the same Tory party is
very solid on the fact that if it were only in power
all the time Australia could go on borrowing
for ever, it being a Tory party of such a sol-
vent, intelligent and magnificent character,
and such a financial genius, and so wholly
honest and reliable that Cohen would always feel
that his millions—any number of his millions—
were safe in its hands. And then we look with
wonder and awe down the long list of Tory poli-
ticians, and count up the deadbeats, the bank-
rupts, the swindlers, the individuals with hopeless
overdrafts, the persons who exist by petty financial
shifts in little cobwebbed offices, the men whose
credit has been stopped by their butchers and
their milkmen; and the magnificent assurance
with which this gang informs the public that if it
is onljf put in office it will be regarded by British
financiers as sufficient security for any amount of
money strikes us like an avalanche.

The Bulletin asks the N.S.W. Labor party, as
the only party which seems to have any definite
purpose in Cornstalk politics, to consider the
above figures and decide what it will do next. It
is bound to do something unless it intends
to be a failure, and gradually die out, and
be buried at no place in particular. The
two _ sets of figures refer to two causes—
the industrial policy of the N.S.W. local Legis-
lature and the fiscal legislation of the Australian
Parliament; but, so far as concerns the N.S.W.
Labor party, the two things are one. The same
people elect N.S.W.’s State and Federal Labor
members. The policy of sinking the fiscal issue
was invented in N.S.W. State politics, and was
transferred, almost entirely through the influence
of the N.S.W. members, to the larger arena of
Australian politics. Now the policy, so far as the
available evidence goes, has burst, and the ques-
tion of what the party proposes to do about it is
urgent.
* * * *
The State Labor party of N.S.W. has always,
and rightly, adopted the policy of encouraging
good wages, moderate hours, and decent labor con-
ditions ; also, foolishly and wrongly, it has never
had anything definite in its policy about helping
the State’s industries to pay these good wages.
It has never even had anything in its policy which
tended to make sure that there would be any
industries to pay wages at all. It just took the
industries for granted. It is impossible to increase
wages without also increasing cost of production,
unless the increase is counterbalanced by greater
skill and a larger output of work ; and nothing in
particular has been done to encourage greater
skill, or greater hustling, or greater economy in
production. An increase in the cost of production
simply means that Australia is rendered less able
to compete with the foreigner, who works longer
hours, or accepts less wages, or is longer estab-
lished, more skilled, and works on a larger and
more economical scale—unless the increased cost
of production is fully counterbalanced by increased
Protection. The N.S.W. Laborites hustled
vigorously for the increased wages and didn’t
hustle to any visible extent after the increased
Protection. The Arbitration Act and the
Federal Protective tariff came into force almost
simultaneously. The party looked after the Arbi-
tration Act most carefully, but it “sank the fiscal
issue,” and allowed Kingston’s tariff to be pared
down without raising any serious objection, till
that tariff became a mere shadow of its original
self. As a result, increased cost of production in
N.S.W. seems to have more than outweighed in-
creased Protection, and N.S.W. industries now
employ 2093 less men than they did in 1901, and—
even allowing for the increase of women em-
ployees—sss less hands altogether. If this result
continues, then the end of the N.S.W. Labor party
is in sight, and its end won’t be respectable, and
it will be buried liked Jehoiakim, King of Judah.
* * * *
Maoriland has about the most advanced and
humane industrial legislation on earth, and it has
high Protection. And Maoriland manufacturing
industries have been growing more rapidly of late
years, in proportion to its population, than those
of any other country on earth, consequently there
is abundance of work for trades-unionists and men
who honorably vote the Labor ticket at elections.
Victoria, under Turner’s Government, had a cer-
tain measure of Factory legislation and compara-
tively high Protection, and during the period when
the Minimum Wage law was in force, Victoria’s
industries grew as they never grew before. Now
it is under a sadly reduced Protective tariff —
the same one which is in force in N.S.W. ; but
Irvine and Bent, with the worst intentions, have
destroyed a great deal of Turner’s humane
legislation, and diminished Protection being
partly balanced by diminished cost of pro-
duction, Victoria’s industries, so far as the
latest returns show, are not in a state of
general slump. But N.S.W. went in cheer-
fully for raising the cost of local production,
and the party which was mainly responsible
for these well-meant and altogether commendable
efforts to improve the condition of the workers—
the Labor party —refused to make any correspond-
ing effort to shut out the produce of the cheap
foreign worker. It played into the hands of the im-
porter, and the Chinaman, and the cheap Hindu,
and foreigners generally. The result seems to
be that Victoria has rather lower wages and an
increase of work, and N.S.W. has rather higher
wages and a diminishing supply of work. No
country can both make goods and import them.
Victoria is cutting down its imports largely, and in
one year it found employment for 6534 new artisans.
N.S.W. is keeping up or increasing its imports,
and in two years it found employment for 555
less artisans, or for 2093 less male artisans—and
it borrowed seven or eight millions to keep its
people alive. And the N.S.W. Labor party, so
far from saying definitely what it is going to do
about it, doesn’t seem to realise the need to do
anything at all.
There is no satisfaction in “ putting the people
on the land.” The land is where trades-unionism
is almost non-existent, where the Arbitration Act
doesn’t apply, where wages are wretched and
hours horrible. To drive people from the indus-
tries where the conditions which the Labor party
has struggled for do apply, and into the industries
where these conditions don’t apply, is to acknow-
ledge the whole Labor policy a failure. To say
that the State has got splendid industrial laws,
and that the only rapidly-growing industries are
those which they don’t influence, is calculated to
arouse the mirth of the godless. Nor is there
much satisfaction in pointing to the growth of the
industries which consist in digging our irreplacable
mineral capital out of the ground and selling it in
its raw state ; they may be keeping up all light,
but they are only temporary industries, and they
are more the act of Providence, which blessed
N.S.W. with rich mineral deposits, than the act
of man. There is not much joy to be ex-
tracted, either, out of the steady increase of
population, seeing that the new population has to
live on the miserably-sweated and ill-paid “going-
on-the-land ” industry, or oil Government loans.
Even the old cry “Look how England has pros-
pered under Ereetrade,” so dear to the Prise trade
Laborites, doesn’t fill the bill. England has no
Arbitration law, and no eight-hours system, and no
Labor legislation worth mentioning. If England
is really holding up its end of the industrial log
under Ereetrade —about which there seems to be
some doubt nowadays —with cheap adult labor
and an immensity of cheap child labor, and long
hours, it doesn’t follow that N.S.W. can do
likewise with reasonable hours and decently-
paid labor. Of course N.S.W. is handicapped
in competition with the worse - treated labor
of other Commonwealth States under the same
tariff. For that reason all industrial legislation
should be handed over to the Australian Parlia-
ment, and the N.S.W. Arbitration law should be
extended to all the Commonwealth. But, how-
ever desirable that proceeding may be, if it is done
without a great increase in the Protective tariff
the chances are that it will only send the
manufacturing industries of the other States
the way those of N.S.W. are going. The
great mass of imports which block local pro-
duction in N.S.W. do not come from adja-
cent States, but from outside the Common-
wealth—they crawl over the inefficient customs
barrier because the barrier isn’t high enough in
proportion to the present cost of production inside.
To make the internal conditions similar in other
States would only mean to accelerate the crawl in
their case also—unless the barrier is raised.
9 * * *
The N.S.W. Labor men, while they sink the
fiscal issue, and profess not to care whether the
products of foreign cheap labor are shut out or
not, and yet raise the cost of Australian Labor,
are playing the game of their enemies. They
refuse to go in for real Protection because the
Herald and Telegraph tell them Protection is
bad—and they do it just as credulously as if the
Herald and Telegraph were their friends, and
likely to give them disinterested advice on that or
any other subject. These papers also urge Aus-
tralia to abolish the Arbitration Act, and trades-
unionism, and the eight-hours system, and the
Labor party bodily—yet even .that doesn’t seem to
convince a large section of the Laborites that
the Herald and Telegraph are advisers that
are better avoided. Sydney’s two morning
shoddies preach, openly and unashamed, the
doctrines of Ereetrade and cheap non-union and
nigger labor as two causes that go together; yet
even that hint isn’t broad enough for many
Laborites. The Freetrade papers declare that the
Labor policy is a failure ; and the policy of
progressive industrial legislation without high
Protection —of raising the cost of local production
without taking any definite steps to shut out
cheap foreign products— is a failure. The failure
is becoming too conspicuous to be overlooked. And
the worst of it is that, if the whole beneficent sys-
tem of industrial legislation is made to fail through
being tried under impossible conditions, the result
will cover the whole system of industrial legisla-
tion with opprobrium. The N.S.W. Labor men
are handicapping their own horse out of the race
through their pathetic anxiety to let the foreigner’s
horse in at a light weight.
« * * *
In N.S.W. a very insufficient measure of Pro-
tection has been tried, and it hasn’t helped local
industries because it was more than outweighed
by the results of industrial legislation—therefore,
the Herald and Telegraph, which vote for Free-
trade and sweating, shriek that Protection is a
failure. Also industrial legislation—in itself both
good and wise—has been tried, and because it
wasn’t accompanied by any sufficient barrier against
foreign cheap products it has diminished manu-
facturing industries, and the Herald and Tele-
graph shriek joyously that industrial legislation is
a failure. The natural result is that, if the Labor men
won’t help with heart and soul to secure high Pro-
tection, a time will come when the bulk of the Pro-
tectionists will help heart and soul to abolish labor
legislation. They will grow tired of being told
that their policy is a failure, and will set
to work to prove that when it is run on
Freetrade wage conditions it can beat Free-
trade out of sight. The first aim of the
Pretectionist is to create local industries. Some
Protectionists want these industries to pay good
wages and work only under fair conditions. Some
only want them to return good profits to the
manufacturer and care little about the conditions,
but are quite willing, as a matter of policy, to grant
the best of conditions if the manufacturer still
makes good profits. The Labor party may attach
both these classes of Protectionists to itself if it
pleases. But if it doesn’t go in for high enough
Protection to enable N.S.W. manufacturing in-
dustries to prosper while paying the present
rate of wages, and under the present fair con-
ditions, then very many Protectionists will go in
for cutting wages low enough to make the present
Protection suffice. Of course there is an alterna-
tive —the accession to power of the Freetrade party
which is openly against arbitration, eight hours,
Trades-unionism and all the rest of the Labor
platform. The N.S.W. Labor party should de-
clare definitely for high Protection, and cease to
impose the fiscal-sinking craze on the Federal
Labor party. It would probably lose a few Free-
trade cranks—the kind who humbly take their
fiscal views from the two morning papers that
kick them at every opportunity—but it would be
stronger without them.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Premier Watson’s Banking Proposals.
It becomes increasingly obvious that the crusade of
certain daily papers against Premier Watson’s
banking proposals arises, not from the fact that
the proposals are likely to be injurious, nor even
from the fact that the proposals are likely to be
other than beneficial, but solely from a frantic
prejudice against the present Democratic Min-
istry. If this theory is not correct, then


the ignorance of some of their comments
would be justly scorned in an ordinary pub-
lic school. Premier Watson proposes that
the banks of the Commonwealth should be
required, as in Canada, to hold 40 per cent, of
their cash reserves in Government notes, and
these are some of Sydney Telegraph’s enlightening
comments on the subject:—
The Commonwealth now says : “ I will take 40 per cent
of your gold, or £7,300,000, and compel you to take my
notes in exchange. Of that £7,300,000, I will sink
£5,100,000 in the Federal Capital and public works.
The coin in the banks would be reduced to under
£11,000,000, and that has to stand the strain not only of in-
ternal circulation, hut constant ivithdrawals for export,
for which Government notes would be no good. It would
be no use for the banks to attempt to circulate the
Government notes ; they would be compelled to hold 40
per cent, all the same, and lock them up for all time, and
it would cost the banks £200,000 a year to hold them.
Our banks have no New York within 24 hours’ call, and
Government securities are but slowly realisable here, and
in London the proceeds of realisations would be five weeks
away. Hence the necessity of our banks holding so much
in actual coin. In addition, our banks are called upon to
remit, say, £15,000,000 in coin annually at such times and
to such destinations as London advises, and must do so
without causing any material inroad on their coin.
It is impossible to imagine the French Government
saying to the Bank of France : “ We want 40 per cent, of
your coin, to enable us to carry out socialistic legislation,
so hand the Treasury over £56,000,000 in gold, and we
will give you Treasury notes, without interest. Those
notes you will never need to circulate, and it will be made
compulsory for you to retain them.” Practically that is
on a par with what Mr. Watson proposes here, and the
notes under such conditions would he simply dead weight,
ONLY TO BE REALISED UPON IN CASE OP LIQUIDATION.
So the Telegraph’s contribution to an intricate
financial problem boils down to this :
The Australian banks now hold, permanently, on the
Telegraph’s figures, about £18,300,000 in gold. It is pro-
posed that instead they should hold £11,000,000 in gold
and £7,300,000 in Government paper. The Telegraph, in
the first extract quoted above, is eloquent on the fact that
the £11,000,000 would be quite insufficient because it has
TO STAND THE STRAIN OF CONSTANT WITHDRAWALS FOR EXPORT.
The Government paper, of course, would only be good for
circulation within the Commonwealth and for export
purposes gold is required.
In its issue of 26th May The Bulletin pointed out the
childish folly of this Telegraph yarn, because, as the
gold reserve in Australian banks remains almost exactly
the same, year after year, it is obvious that it doesn’t
“ stand the strain of constant withdrawals for export ”
that the strain of gold exports is borne by the new gold
production. Then the Telegraph climbed down and
published yarn No. 2 to the effect that the banks provide
for gold exports “without causing any material inroad
on their coin.” Therefore the Telegraph’s first theory
that the £11,000,000 of gold which Premier Watson’s
scheme would leave in the banks would be insufficient to
cover withdrawals for export is admittedly a sham ; the
gold reserve of the banks, by the Telegraph’s second
theory, isn’t used for that purpose. Yet the paper
continues just as angry. The Telegraph has an
incredibly wild idea that if the banks kept £7,300,000 of
Government paper money lying idle and earning nothing,
instead of £7,3oo,oooofgoldlyingidleand earning nothing,
it would cost the banks £200,000 a year—apparently
£200,000 in excess of the cost of keeping gold. How it
would cost the banks any more to have paper earning
nothing than to have gold earning nothing even a com-
mittee of pawnbrokers could hardly explain.
The Telegraph says that the Government notes
wouldn’t circulate. They do in Queensland, in Canada,
in the U.S., in every country where there are Government
notes — but they wouldn’t do so here because the Tele-
graph says so.
And it raves violently to the effect that the banks
would have to hold these notes “to all time.” They
would be “dead weight, only to be realised upon in case of
liquidation.” This is such a garish foolishness that even
the Telegraph can hardly be suspected of believing it.
Under the system which Premier Watson proposes to
adopt, a bank would keep, say, £400,000 of Government
notes locked up idle for all time if it had also £600,000 of
gold locked up idle for all time and not otherwise. Just
as soon as its gold ceased to be a “ dead weight, only to
be realised upon in case of liquidation,” its notes would
do the same. For every £60,000 of its dead weight of idle
and unproductive gold which it put into circulation it
would put £40,000 of its dead weight of idle and unpro-
ductive notes into circulation. And how the notes lying
idle would be any deader than the gold doing the same,
seeing they both would be dead for the same time and
under the same circumstances, and would resurrect
simultaneously, even the most indignant Tory journal
could hardly tell.
There isn’t much intelligence in Australian
Toryism; it relies mostly on its sniff of superiority.
And in this case the sniff has broken out in a very
aggravated form.

The Curiosities of a Coalition.
That curious coalition, in which Deakin is to
sink his party and Reid has to sink whatever he
has left of his principles, was reported “ off” some
days ago. The Protectionist party, wiser than its
leader, refused to have anything to do with Reid,
especially since the proposed arrangement gave
him the Premiership. Then Reid, in desperation,
said that he was willing to stand aside from the
Premiership if only he were helped to office. It
is Reid’s policy just now to hurry up matters. He
wishes to know definitely whether Federal office is
withm his grasp before the N.S.W. State elections
have come so near as to prevent him taking
Carruthers’ place. That is the second string to
Reid’s bow, and he does not wish to see it lost
whilst he is playing wvith the first. But why
Deakin should aid this .very transparent game of a
very transparent trickster is a mystery. Having
gone out as a strong man on a conscientious issue
with the respect of the House behind him, Deakin
can afford to wait the turn of the tide. He is,
presumably, in no feverish hurry for office again,
and yet that will be the only reason that the pub-
lic, however unjustly, will ascribe to his turning
back to the negotiations with Reid. Deakin may
convince himself, but he cannot possibly con-
vince the mass of the voters, that his sense of
constitutional propriety is so outraged by the
existence of a minority party in office that he
must at all sacrifices end such a position; he
should have thought of his constitutional pro-
priety before, when he was holding office as the
leader of a minority. There is one, and only one,
adequate explanation to be given for a coalition to
dispossess Watson— as yet practically untried,
out as far as tried proved worthy—and that is
office greed and the snobbish hate and fury which
mis the small souls of John Forrest and George
Reid when they see a Democratic Ministry in
Ce ’ i, • EA . KIN may not share that feeling ; but
the pubhc will believe that he shares it if he assists •
m the assassination which it prompts. What the
late of such a coalition will be can be easily
lorecasted a union without principles but only
treacheries to principle ; with its united per-
sonalities still mutually hostile and incongruous
to the public eye, accustomed to see them in
opposite camps; without hope of appealing for
support on any progressive platform; able to
allege as its reason for existence only the
imaginary horrors of allowing a Democratic
Ministry to stay m office. In N.S.W. such a
coalition would alienate all the Protectionists,
one sure Principle is hostility to the
which Reid represents ; it
wouid Within three months be faced by
ci'flWs° Stl i! ty bitter Sydney provin-
ahsts, who only support Reid because he is
, mstrument of their petty spites, and would
i ’iterate him once he deviated from a
wITTI of ™ d ymg enmity to Victoria. In Vic-
p l ? -P r °tectionists would be, to an almost
equal extent, alienated, for they would see their
cherished principles abandoned—not merely sunk
—by their leaders. In Westralia and in Queens-
land, the Labor party would be made supreme.
In Tasmania and South Australia the coalition
would drive many into the arms of the only party
left with a platform and a set of principles. And
the coalition would almost certainly have to face
the country within three months. If Watson
were defeated and did not get a dissolution at
once, he could secure an appeal to the people very
quickly in the ordinary course of events. The
coalition would be the grave of some reputations
that Australia would be sorry to bury, but no
other development could better solidify the Demo-
cratic forces.

The Banishment of Percy Chirnside.
In a typical, but woefully ill-timed, burst of
candor Frank Madden, of Boroondara (Vic.),
gave the Mackinnon party about the best testi-
monial it has received up to date. Denouncing
the Mackinnon programme by and large, Madden
wound up with the remark that —
The land policy of the Opposition would drive men like
Mr. Chirnside out of the State.
This awful threat, instead of filling Frank’s audi-
ence with dismay, was received with yells of
laughter ; whereupon Madden shook the meeting
off his feet, grabbed his hat and went home. It
is due to Frank Madden to state that he really
believes that the departure of Percy Chirnside
would be a terrific blow to the State. With the
personality of Percy Chirnside The Bulletin
has no quarrel. Indeed, for some of his unex-
pectedly liberal actions it has commended him.
But at the same time if the Opposition policy is
likely to make him sell out and leave the
State, it deserves the strenuous and solid sup-
port of every patriotic Victorian. If one Percy
Chirnside swears off all connection with Victoria
it means that 50 or 100 thriving farmers will take
his place. The Melbourne stonemasons’ union
announced recently that some 60 members had
lately drawn their clearances, and left the country,
and, as productive citizens, one stonemason is
worth half-a-dozen Chirnsides. But evidently
poor old Frank Madden would gladly see every
stonemason, to say nothing of the bricklayers and
carpenters, flocking down to the outward bound
steamers, sooner than lose his unproductive friend
Chirnside ; and the fact that, within almost a
stone’s throw of Melbourne, the Chirnsides own
thousands of acres of land sprinkled with sheep,
where there ought to be farms as thick as Bent’s
election promises, apparently doesn’t trouble him
at all.

Concerning Some Dim Grey Chaos.
Some time ago Maoriland got lost in a wide and
impenetrable fog over the licensing question, the
centre of the gloom being the Newtown district.
In November, 1902, “No License” was carried at
the Local Option poll, but the entire poll was up-
set and declared null and void over some foolish
technicality. Then the fog set in. The law makes
no provision for a new poll if the old one is de-
clared void. It is possible for none of the
questions (Continuance of Licenses, Reduction of
Licenses, or No License) to be carried, for the first
two go by a bare majority, while “No License”
needs to get 60 per cent, of the votes polled before
it. is carried. If there are 5500 votes for “No
License ” in a poll of 10,000, then nothing has
been decided, though if there are 5001 votes for
Continuance, then a decision has been arrived at.
When no proposition is carried licenses re-
main as they are till next poll. But this
wasn’t a case in which nothing was carried at the
poll—it was a case in which there was legally no
poll at all to carry anything at. Yet as the law
says there must be a poll, the Licensing Committee
held that it must assume there was a poll. So it
went by the vote which had been declared invalid,
taken at the poll which (legally) didn’t happen,
and refused to renew the licenses. The local pub-
licans sold without licenses, and were fined. They
applied for a mandamus to compel the Committee
to grant licenses, and the case worried its way
through all the courts, gathering more gloom and
extra fog on the way, until it at last arrived as a
dim grey chaos before the Privy Council. That
body decided that the licenses ought to be
granted, and the Pump party nearly went mad with
vexation. But such is the remarkable position of
affairs that, instead of this decision of the Privy
Council being a solution of the problem, it raises
up all sorts of new tangles. In the first place,
Premier Seddon remarked last year, before the
fog had gathered to such an extent as to blot out
his remarks, that if the Privy Council were to
decide that the licenses should be granted, the
publicans, who had been forced to let the dust
gather on their beer-pumps, would have a claim
for compensation, and it seems reasonably cer-
tain that they have. At all events, the tem-
porarily eclipsed Bungs, immediately upon
emerging into beer and freedom and sunlight
again, announced that they were going to claim
that compensation. The troubld“is now to deter-
mine who is to pay the compensation the
Government which devised the law, or the com-
mittee which wrongly administered it, or the local
people who elected the wrong committee. More-
over, it has been proved that a local option poll can
be rendered void in about 25 easy and accessible
ways, and then the publican is safe for another
three years. Consequently it seems reasonably
probable that every poll will now be void until
the law is amended. Then, in addition to the
question of compensation, there are costs to be
paid by somebody, and illegal fines and past costs
to be made good by somebody. Maoriland is
growing old and grey in the attempt to discover
what the position is, and some people are urging
that steps should be taken to sell the laws and
devote the proceeds to buying something definite,
with a thick froth on it.

Politics from the Bench.
Part of the price which a citizen must pay if he
aspires to be a Judge is the abandonment of all
partisanship in the political life of the community.
The Judge must not merely be fair or neutral in
' his politics ; he must have, publicly, no politics at
all. He is sworn to administer the laws, but for-
bidden to criticise them. It is his business to see
that they are faithfully observed and their true
intention interpreted, but not to suggest that Par-
liament acted wisely or unwisely in passing any
particular Act. If a Judge feels that some Act so
offends his conscience that he cannot administer it
he has a prompt relief in resignation, and then, as
a citizen or as a politician, he can be as loud in
condemnation as he pleases. But an essential of
our judicial system is that the enthroned Judge is
no partisan, and on the bench has no politics, no
sect, no friendships. It is deplorable to find this
wholesome and vitally necessary rule of conduct
broken by the Chief Justice of N.S. Wales who,
from the Bench on May. 25, made an attack on the
Arbitration Act, which might have been in place
if delivered in Parliament or from ah Employers’
Union platform (though either there or anywhere
else it would have shown a vast depth of mis-
understanding of the subject), but which, in the
Supreme Court, from the Chief Justice, was grossly
improper. Said Mr. Darley, forgetting for the
while his position as Chief J ustice Daeley :
The Arbitration Act is an Act productive of the most
alarming and deplorable amount of litigation, with its
concomitant ill-feeling and ill-will between employers and
employees, who are under this Act forced into two
hostile camps. I believe the object in passing the Act
was to promote peace and g - ood will between employer
and employee. I fear it has not had that effect.
The Sydney Morning Herald, which is an
avowed foe of the Arbitration Act, was prompt to
seize upon this utterance, and in a leader, May 26,
commented :
When delivering the judgment of the Pull Court yester-
day, in the matter of the Brickmakers and Pipe Manufac-
turers’ Union, the Chief Justice took occasion to criticise
the operations of the Arbitration Act, and his summing
up of the evils it is working deserves to be read by every
thoughtful member of the community. A more scathing
indictment of the law, from which Mr. Wise has fondly
expected so much, could hardly have been drawn, and,
coming from such a source, it will command instant
attention. ... It was laid down yesterday as past dispute
that the Arbitration Act was mischievous in its opera-
tions, and encroached upon the liberty of the subject in
defiance of the Common Law. . . . Perhaps the Common-
wealth Parliament will make a note of the fact that the
verdict of the highest authority in this State —the judg-
ment of one of the most dispassionate and widely experi-
enced minds amongst us—is against the experiment which
has been made here.
The opinions which Mr. Daeley holds as to the
Arbitration Act are of no concern to the public,
so long as he keeps them private. He may, if he
chooses, give full credence to the stupid or male-
volent fictions which are chattered at the clubs
and drawled at Darling Point dinner parties about
an Act, which will in due time be accepted unani-
mously as an altogether beneficient legislative
instrument; that is between him and his consci-
ence or his intelligence. But as Chief Justice he
must not express political opinions favorable or
unfavorable. Nor should he make himself ridi-
culous by posing as an authority on political
economy, of which he probably knows little,
and on industrial matters, of which he probably
knows nothing at all. The case is one which
calls for some definite action from the N.S.W.
Government. Yet action is difficult. Parliament
not being in session a remonstrance cannot be
evoked from the Legislature, and the Cabinet of it-
self is powerless to rebuke. Still it might publicly
record its protest against the serious judicial
trespass. Judges in N.S.W. have lately shown a
marked inclination to forget the duties and
responsibilities of the Bench ; Chief Justice
Daeley’s political outburst represents, so far, the
most extreme point that forgetfulness has
reached. If it is allowed to go unchallenged we
shall soon have the Judges on the hustings, or
carrying banners in political processions.

Outtrim, D.P.M.G.
The matter with Feank Outteim, Deputy-
P.M.-G. of Vic., is that he does not know that the
Commonwealth has happened. He was Deputy-
P.M.-G. for the State of Victoria, and, while
such, he bossed Minister and messenger, partly
because the Ministers were mostly very small
potatoes, partly because he is a major in the
militia Artillery, with high notions. While he was
a State official this was right enough. Watt,
when P.M.-G. in Victoria, tried to keep him
in order, but Outtrim compromised Watt so much
with one thing or another, that he had to give up
explaining, especially as all the big wigs were
behind the official. Later on, when the Federa-
tion came, Outteim tried to boss the Minister as
usual, with the result that Deakin gave a ruling,
as Attorney-General, that there was only one
permanent head to the post-office, and he was not
Outtrim or any other Victorian. So Outtrim
dropped down to be the mere head of a branch.
This cruel act of Deakin’s cut off all Out-
TElm’s Government House official invitations.
That was one worry. Now he is not allowed to
have his own way he wants to be made
a martyr on a pension of £6OO a year.
The present snorting of Outteim is, in fact, a de-
liberate appeal to the States Frights feeling and
the Bent reaction in Victoria. Outtrim’s brother
could have told him what that was worth, seeing
he has gone over to the Labor party at
Maryborough, but probably the Major did
not ask him. He relied on the Argus
helping him through as it has helped other straws
to face a storm before to-day. Outtrim was
mighty quiet for a while after he was nearly
retired by Drake, but he evidently thought that
Mahon, being “ only a Labor man,” could
be sniffed at. He has found out his mis-
take. He also found out something else—
that the House of Reps, is behind Mahon.
Outteim is a good enough man in his way. He
was a hard-working postmaster for years. He
was also a hard-working inspector, and, as Deputy
P.M.G. of Victoria, he used to sit up at nights
doing work he could have had done easily
by a junior clerk ; but he never knew
how to manage men. When the Federal
Ministry headed him off he was carrying on a
campaign of irritation against the telegraph
operators that would have ended in such a mutiny
as Bent forced on amongst the locomotive men in
the railways. Since then he has nagged, and
fined, but generally kept quiet with the operators.
He has been helpless to harm the letter carriers,
but he refused to send on their letters to head
quarters just to show his authority, and now
Mahon has shown him that he has no authority.
If Outtrim can this time learn, once and for all,
his place he might stay in office; if he can’t he
will be no great loss.

The weak point in the N.S.W. Local Government
Convention was exposed in the first big question
that it tackled. It was the old trouble of the
franchise. Acting-Premier Wise proposed that
on ordinary questions there should be adult
suffrage; on questions involving the striking of
a special rate or the floating of a loan, that only
property-holders should vote. The Convention
scouted the idea. Generally speaking, nobody
has a better opinion of himself, or a keener
sense of his own vast importance, than
Mr. Alderman Boggs. Mr. Alderman Boggs
keeps the corner grocery store; and any
suggestion that he should be brought to the
level of the fellow without “ a stake in the town”
is unthinkable. And this was a convention of
Alderman Boggses. To expect it, then, to go
back upon its worship of “the man with a stake
in the town ” was to expect too much. We can’t
reckon upon any corner-groceryman casting asper-
sions upon himself in that offhand manner. But
for just those reasons we need not take the con-
vention’s opinions upon such matters as of much
importance. A convention of tenants, who pay
the landlords the rates which the landlords
pay the councils, would probably have a dif-
ferent opinion ; and, after all, as the one who
lives there (which the landlord often doesn’t
do) the tenant is the man who is most
interested in the cleanliness of the drain outside
his cottage. Further, the drain is of just as much
interest to the lodger, who pays the tenant the
money he pays in rent to the landlord, who pays
some of it in rates. The only way to make a
Greater Sydney, as The Bulletin has frequently
pointed out, is to draft a Bill making the 44 muni-
cipalities into one, and submit -it to the people,
wholly ignoring Alderman Boggs. This same
rule holds equally good as regards almost every
other question of municipal extension or improve-
ment. In every case the purpose is either to
reform Boggs where he exists (and he can’t see
that he needs reform), or to extend municipal
government without extending the present variety
of Boggs (and to that gentleman’s way of thinking
the whole problem of civilisation consists in the
extension of Boggs).

There was a touch of tragedy in the debate in the
House of Representatives when it met after the
first coalition negotiations fell through. It occurred
in Reid’s speech, when he wanted to know why
so many of Deakin’s followers refused to have
anything to do with him. “If I am the stumbling-
block,” he said, “let me go.” And again, “Is it
true that I am an obj ect of general hatred ? ”
Apparently it is beginning to dawn even on
George Reid’s intelligence that he is an object of
general something; that he is recognised as a
shuffler and a sham and a time-server, and a man
with no vestige of political principle; that he is a
smoking-room joke and an after-dinner shriek ;
that he is a. useful political tool simply because he
will do things that no other politician would do,
and can crawl through holes that no other politi-
cian can get through, and dodge round corners so
sharp that no one else could get round them
without breaking. In his declining years he
is a handy person to arrange coalitions because
he can swallow more principles without burst-
ing than anybody else; he is an oily lubricant
that can grease the hinges when the door
opens that leads to office ; he can cast a glamor
over the Yes-No, and sit on a rail with a certain
clumsy agility ; and he is in every possible com-
bination because he is capable of combining with
anybody, if it pays, and can adopt any political
views that look like being remunerative. And,
with it all, he isn’t an object of hatred exactly,
but of general contempt mingled with amuse-
ment. In politics he stands between Judah
Iscariot and the Performing Dog — about half-a-
mile from Judas and half a-yard from the Per-
forming Dog.

The odoriferous M. K. M'Kenzee, the Irvine-
Bent’s disgraced Lands Minister, was the chiefesfc
barracker for the Bible in State schools among all
the Victorian candidates. The godly crowd,
should be proud of their representative. Even
though press and Parliament had driven it into
his dense skull that he had been guilty practi-
cally of fraud as a public trustee, the unspeakable
Mac not only refuses to see the nefariousness of
his acts, but is openly charged with being at some-
thing very like the same old game still. This is
from an Age report of M'Kenzie’s meeting at
Seymour:—
Mr. Clydesdale asked if the candidate was now renting-
from the Crown 2357 acres at an annual rental of £ll
Bs. Id., 70 acres at 11s. Bd. and 289 acres at £3 ss. per
annum, and whether he was in occupation of 440 acres for
which the Crown had received no rental for 10 years.
Mr. M'Kenzie replied that he had got land at the usual
rental. He had no responsibility in regard to the 440-acre
block, as there was no fencing to keep his sheep from
running on it.
Mr. Clydesdale : You grazed your sheep on it.
A Voice : When you were Minister why did you not let
people who had starving stock know of this land ?
Mr. Clydesdale : I would give Is. per acre rental for it..
Your sheep are running on the 440-acre block now.
Mr. M'Kenzie : Those statements are absolutely
untrue. (Uproar.)
Mr. Clydesdale : I will give £lO to the Kilmore hospi-
tal if you can prove them untrue. (Great cheering.)
Mr. M'Kenzie said Mr. Clydesdale had accused him of
dummyism. He challenged him to prove it.
Mr. Clydesdale : You have occupied land for which the
Crown has not received a penny rent for 10 years- If
that is not dummyism, what is ? (Applause.)
Mr. M'Kenzie said that if returned, and the religious-
instruction question came before the House, he would
move that a capitation grant be given to Roman Catholic
schools.
Apparently M'Kenzie changed the subject from
land to piety very suddenly.

According to the Vic. Government Statist’s cal-
culations, Bent’s territory lost 16,570 people by-
excess of emigration over immigration last year..
The blessed birth-rate did what it could, and
added 13,974 in excess of deaths ; but Irvine and
Bent were greater than the birth-rate, and beat it
by 2596. .And N.S. Wales helped Irvine and
Bent. Victoria had built up a fair number of
manufacturing industries with the aid of a moder-
ately stiff Protectionist tariff ; then, for the sake
of Australian unity, it put its tariff out of its own
power, and N.S. Wales sent along Bill Wilks
and Conroy to whittle the Protection away-
Even Victoria itself was temporary ass enough to
send along Zeal and Sargood and old Simon
Fraser, reckoning that one or two Calico
Jimmies wouldn’t count. They didn’t count for
much alone ; but, with the N.S.W. Jimmies to
help them, they counted for enough to scrape
down duties from 20 to 15 per cent., and
from. 121 to 10—just enough to admit in
certain lines the products of the very cheapest
and most vilely-sweated sorts of foreigner.
The manufacturing industries keep growing in the
aggregate, but the growth is mostly in the low
wage industries. Agricultural settlement can’t
progress because unpatriotic big landlords and
public enemies like Percy Ghirnside keep the
land locked up, except at such exorbitant terms
that people, rather than pay them, leave the
State to look for space elsewhere. Bent shrieks
about land resumption and land settlement, but
does nothing. And Victoria has no Owe’Sullivan,
as N.S.W. has, to keep the people employed out of
large and reckless loans. So the State begins to
empty itself, and Thomas, the Depopulator, yells
in the midst of a growing desolation, and the
kangaroo begins to dream of the day when he will
re-occupy Melbourne.

Defence Minister Dawson (and before him De-
fence Minister Chapman) was quite right in re-
fusing to pay out Commonwealth money for
secret telegrams sent by Federal Commandant
Hutton to the British War Office. Indeed either
might have gone further with propriety and have
absolutely forbidden any secret communications
between General Hutton and the British army
authorities. Such a veto might easily have been
defied—through the post if not the cable —but for
an offence discovered the penalty might have
been set down as dismissal. Whilst General
Hutton is the paid servant of Australia he has no
business with the British War Office except such
as he transacts through the Australian Defence
Minister. When his term of office is up, he can
do as he pleases, and disclose as much or as little
of our military matters as considerations of pro-
priety suggest. But as a matter of honor he
should disclose nothing, and should now have
nothing secret from the Australian Cabinet.

The “book” of the “Rose of the Riviera”
—produced for the first time in Sydney by George
Stephenson’s Musical Comedy co., last Saturday,
at the Lyceum —is by Reginald Bacchus, and he
was more Bacchus than Reginald at the time. It
has a reckless night-out sort of plot of the “ Flora-
dora ” order, a plot which does not want to go
home until morning—if then —and is always willing
to stop for a drink by the wayside. As in this
instance the drinks are of good quality, this may
be counted for righteousness. When it is under-
stood that the Rose of the Riviera is keeping a
flower-stall at N ice, though she is of gentle birth and
has enough evening-dresses in her trunks to wear
them of mornings, and that she thinks she has
been jilted by a lord but hasn’t, it only being a
misunderstanding, the plot and the plot’s sequel
are plain enough. The comedy business hangs on
the point that the lord and his pa, who is a duke,
and his ma, who is a decorative duchess dressed
mainly in white shoulders and diamonds, do not
arrive at their hotel on the Riviera according to
time-table, and are personated by an English cock-
ney and a bright American girl. On this slender
platform, thin as it is in its legs, is reared a
sparkling show which isn’t at all thin in its legs or
its arms, and which bustles along with charac-
teristic American slap-dash, helped by pretty girls,
clever dancers and bright costumes. A flavor of
newness and originality pervades the “Rose”
throughout.

The name part falls to Miss May Beatty,
whose short rest from forcing top-notes in
Hungarian comic opera seems to have done her
a world of good. She acts with vivacity, and
sings with much of the old sweetness and little of
the recent tinnyness; further, the lady has either
acquired a new countenance or a new trick of
make-up, for her stage appearance has improved
wonderfully. The Rose is the best bit of work
Miss Beatty has so far done in Sydney. Consider-
able too are the services of Miss May Garstang and
Miss Alice Nixon, who have parts almost as
important. Both sing sweetly, and Miss Garstang
can fling a nimble toe. The comedy team is
headed by Edward Lauri, who as the cockney
called upon to be a duke, and later a duchess, has
a chance to raise the loud laugh that betokens
a full house, and makes good use thereof.
W. Bovis, Charles M'Naughton, and Charles
Bovis assist the fun. Ered Twitchin has the part
of Lord Balham, the “hero” of what little plot
gets home ; it is a colorless part by evil intent of
the author, and the player is not able to pull it up
and give it distinction. “The Rose” was well
received on Saturday and Monday, and will be
continued until further notice.

At Sydney Royal the parson hero who has

piece, whilst not rivalling the popularity of “The
Great Millionaire,” has nevertheless attracted and
pleased satisfactory audiences.

At Her Majesty’s, on Monday night, Cuyler

ought to lock their characters, if the efflu-
vium wouldn’t stream through the keyhole.

the cracksman’s bijou flat) just once more, when
he slid out of the fourth-storey window with the
detectives coming very near the hook end of the
rope. This week is one of resurrections. Tuesday
and Wednesday were billed as the days for “ The
Christian” to resurrect and Glory to flaunt her
banner of red hair. Thursday and Friday will be
sacred to the loves of Claude Melnotte and his
lady of Lyons. On Saturday, “ The Darling of
the Gods” will lift its Japanese head on Her
Majesty’s stage against a wonderful pictorial back-
ground.

Albert Friedenthal, the noted pianist, is
back after long years. He toured Australasia in
1899, and put up a record in Sydney with 15 con-
certs. Friedenthal, who is recognised as one of
the foremost players of the day, was to start his
Sydney concert season yesterday at the Centenary
Hall, and presumably did so, but this issue was in
the press just thein and doesn’t know for certain.
Under such conditions some papers take the risk
and say in advance that the star played in a bril-
liant fashion, and then if the hall was burned
down or the star broke his neck they look ridicu-
lous. Friedenthal is to play again to-night (Thurs-
day) and to-morrow (Friday). Mr. J. H. Finlay -
son is acting as pilot-light for the star.

If The Bulletin were the S.M. Herald,
which it has so far managed to avoid, it would
write a large philosophical article weighing 23cwt.
on the question “Under the Higher Laws of
Civilisation and Christianity, is a Lady as much
entitled to make herself Ugly as she is to make
herself Beautiful ? ” In “ The Marriage of Kitty,”
in order to rope in a comfortable settlement (and
incidentally a husband whom she isn’t supposed
to ever live with or even see again), Rose
Musgrove “makes up” as a “perfect fright”;
and the house has qualms of conscience as to
whether Kitty isn’t doing a wrong thing. It feels
that it’s like a beggar distorting his body in order
to get more sympathy and small change. “ No,”
the dress circle says to the stalls as it
goes home in the tram, “ I think it’s
real wicked—it’s getting a husband under false
pretences.” The fact that, later on, Kitty puts
on her mousseline de soie, and fixes up again the
thatch which she had taken off and hung on the
door knob, and makes a sudden improvement in
her complexion out of a pot — that doesn’t trouble
either circle or stalls a bit; all that is passed as
fair and legitimate and moral. Altogether it is a
curious law, unwritten but apparently absolute,
that it’s false pretences to make yourself uglier
than you are, and fair business to seem prettier.

The first change of programme by Nawn’s
comedy co., at Sydney Palace, brought out “ The
Rosebuds,” ladies who sing a little and dance a
little. They fill what was felt to be a hole in the
opening performance, which included no dancing
lady. The remarkable xylophonists, the “tossing
Austins,” the “Hiawatha” troubadours, and Mr.
Pete Baker all supply new items ; Miss Dahl, the
soprano soloist, has now the “range” of the house
much better than she had at the start ; and in a
smart little sketch, “ Shipmates,” _ Tom Nawn
presents another of his quaint Irish character
studies, being assisted this time by Pete Baker as
an Amurrikan. It is a bright and artistic show
right enough.

Carkeek, the wrestler, is still the large star
in the Tivoli heavens. As this paragraph is being
inked, and unless things fall out differently, Mer-
zouk, the big Algerian, is having his first meeting
with the Cornish-American; and if the work of
the Algerian is as brilliant as his raiment, the
Tivoli is having an exciting time. Otherwise
there hasn’t been much excitement; most of the
bouts have been very lop-sided. An American
piccaninny “turn” has been added to the bill
since last week, nimble Clifford is still there, and
the Scotch balladist who impressed this paper
favorably a week ago has got so deep in its good
opinion that only his head is visible above the
heaving mass of approval.

The lion has shipped his roar, the wire-
rope lady has taken off her smile, and Tomato
Can and the other Japanese wrestlers have
waddled in and out for the last time. In short,
the Fitzgeralds have folded their tents like good
Australians during this week, and moved on to
parts which don’t yet know what thrills they can
get out of the sight of strong-jawed Gordon
slithering 200 ft. by the skin of his teeth. Parra-
matta is likely to be the first of those parts.

A new organisation, J. S. Ryan’s Comedy
co., will start a season, in the rejuvenated Sydney
Queen’s Hall, on Friday, June 3. The co. will
appear in a new curtain-raiser, “Night and Morn-
ing ” ; if this hurts, it don’t hurt for long, as it is
billed to last only half-an-hour. “ Jane,” a farce-
comedy which has already been tried on many
audiences, and is good enough to be tried on many
more, will follow.

The programme for Johnny Wallace’s
matinee benefit at Her Majesty’s (Melb.) proved
to be a queer patchwork, measuring 4£ hours in
length. Two or three, or more, of the items were
accepted by the present chronicler as the conse-
quences of his sins, and the names of the perpetra-
tors are treasured for vengeful comment should
they chance to reappear on any future matinee
occasion; but the entertainment showed some
interesting patches, contributed by members of
Williamson’s Dramatic Co. Percy Walshe, Miss
Olive Noble and Frank Sterling gave a
neat performance of “ The Man in the
Street,” a one act comedy drama (author,
Louis N. Parker) which has its mawkish stagey
little fiction brightened by the truthful manner-
isms of the Man. The slum-bred cockney, who
blows his beery breath into a wind instrument and
earns the price of a pint by being paid to move on,
is a villainous first-cousin to the deceased Wander-
ing Minstrel of poor old Fred Maccabe. He
utters all the tricks of London gutter speech, with
a natural unconsciousness of their humor—a
humor that owes as much of its pungency to a
hoarse, depraved accent as the cute American
idiom owes to the national nasal twang. Percy
Walshe spoke the lines pointedly in a quiet,
casual manner, and the character lived. Towards
the end of the long afternoon Miss Noble ap-
peared again, this time with Eardley Turner, in
the latter’s own comedietta, “The Dunmow
Flitch.” It is just a duologue between a husband
and a wife, who, having carried off the flitch prize
for conjugal sweetness at an annual public travesty
of the old-time Dunmow custom, start to quarrel
when they return home with the bacon. Eardley
Turner’s sketch is the sort of thing that amateur
comedians are always looking for, but it needs a
note of explanation on an Australian bill. Also,
the title may as well be correctly spelled. Dun-
mow was perverted into “ Dunmore ” on the bill,
as well as in the advt., and the property man had
fashioned the flitch of bacon after the image of a
sucking pig, legs and all.
Her Majesty’s (Melbourne) was to close on
Wednesday, and the house will remain in the
builder’s hands for a week or two whilst new exits
and other expensive precautions against panic
tragedies are mopping up some of the profits of
“Silver King.” Melbourne’s womankind in
general, supported by a moderate percentage of
mail, came with a rush to the “Silver King”
revival and wept as usual. The popularity of
Jones and Hermann’s romance seems to increase
as it grows older. In its young days it was merely
much better than the ordinary contemporary melo-
drama, pure and simple. Nowadays it is im-
mensely superior in literary merit to all modern
drama stories, save those that are not so simple
and consecutive.

The second of Marshall Hall’s winter
“ Orchestrals ” drew a crowd that didn’t fill all the
chairs at Melbourne Town Hall last Saturday,
although a new Symphony by “ the Master” was
the main attraction. Coming after a gloomy
Wagner overture on the subject of Faust in Soli-
tude, which vainly pretends to express the spiritual
aches and pains of a dyspeptic old man, the new
Symphony by Marshall Hall was at least a suc-
cessful attempt to wake the audience up. The
composer states —and he ought to know—that
his work “belongs rather to the naive, spon-
taneous than to the introspective, analytical
school.” Certainly it may be taken to sig-
nify the everyday emotions of, say, an active,
ardent, commercial traveller, who is disposed
to jump on his bloomin’ ’at for joy when
he books a big order for blankets. It is a jerky,
brassy, pushful sort of symphony in the first and
third movements. Its moral tone is a bit noisy,
but not lacking in variety. Perhaps the striving
after originality is more apparent than the
achievement of the design, and without a doubt
the middle movement, “solemn and contempla-
tive,” is very dull. Altogether the work is too
long for its strength. Every musical undertaking
of Marshall Hall’s deserves encouragement, for he
works with enthusiasm and knows his trade.
Therefore he may be encouraged to prune his
symphony. It contains matter that the honest
ear rejects as being uninteresting. A composer
must not bore the ear that is open to instruction.
He must charm, soothe, and tickle it. Above
all things he must bite it, now and then.

The well-staged drama at Melbourne Royal
is seemingly set for an innings of three weeks, or
longer. A rag baby, sometimes alluded to as a
burden of shame, plays an important part in
“ Tommy Atkins,” for it is on account of the bogus
little stranger that Miss Duggan jumps into an
incomprehensible river and Willard dives after
her. Willard’s dive suggests that he was certainly
not in the circus business before he took
to stage villainy. He ascends from the river
bank in a perpendicular position and descends
feet foremost into the feather-bed of the
painted stream. As a horrible Face at the
Window, or an evil nephew in an excessive frock-
coat, Willard is about equal to the best of them,
but as a human instrument for pulling the heroine
out of the wet he is what the Athenians of old
called “no bloomin’ shakes.” Moreover, his act
of rescue is a most insistent proceeding—a mere
freak of remorse. Half an hour later he leads
Miss Duggan to the top of a steep cliff and shoves
her off with the wickedest intentions. Luckily,
Inman, who is roosting somewhere in the side of the
precipice, stretches forth his hand and catches the
lady in her downward flight. Therefore her blud
is not on Willard’s soul.

At the Princess’s there is not the antici-
pated “boom ” business for “Three Little Maids,”
consequently the vicar’s pleasing daughters will be
withdrawn on Friday, after a run of three weeks
—one week for each maid. The soft-headed lord,
together with the French gentleman who was
created for kissing purposes, and the slim bari-
tone, and the gold caddy with the abbreviated
legs will follow the girls into exile. On Saturday
another musical show, less of a “ play ” and more
of a comedy, will arrive, “ The Girl from Kay’s.”

At the Opera House the strength of the
polite vaudeville is well maintained. Dan Burke
and his two damsels in crimped stockings are
dancing as prettily as before, also the tuneful
young “ actor-vocalist ” continues to make the
most of his typical music-hall songs, which usually
put in a kind word for mother, and serve to
remind the gallery that all flesh is grass, and
friendship doesn’t go for much when you want to
borrow five shillings. Likewise the Empire
Girls, with whom are incorporated the Two Bells,
came back to Melbourne on Saturday for 12 fare-
well nights. The Girls have won the respect of
the public by their artistic attention to business,
and their “Hiawatha” turn was cheered like an
influential spokesman at a monthly meeting of the
Employers’ Defence League.

Harry Rickards, believing in rapid altera-
tions, has followed the “ Brown in Town ” show at
Adelaide Tivoli with a “ Minstrel and Specialty ”
co. of his own. The Americans departed much
regretted. Miss Olive Evans is an acquired taste,
which grows rapidly on the acquirer. The indi-
vidual and combined work of Douglas and Louise
Ford is another item worth starring, and altogether
the Tivoli has been the scene lately of more
laughter than had been heard there for years.
The present tenants include one monkey and
several coons, with Fred Bluett (a special favorite
in Adelaide) and those remarkable boys, the
Uessems. At the old Exhibition, Wirth’s Circus
has been providing a regular variety entertain-
ment. The mystifying Howard Brothers are still
“baffling the human race,” and two dusky
brothers from Hindustan wrestle with each other
in the intervals of offering to rub any mere white
person in the dust for the paltry sum of £lOO.

The Bank of New Zealand still holds first place easily ;
but, then, its position is extraordinary. It has had the
use of £2,000,000 of State money at 4 per cent. ; and in
the foregoing this is reckoned as deposit and not capital.
If it were reckoned as capital the return for last year
would be £lO 14s. 3d., and for the year before that
£9 7s. 3d. The Q.N., which also had State aid, is steadily
dropping behind in the matter of earnings; its position
among Australian banks during the last three years has
been respectively Ist, 3rd, and now 4th. The Union has
come into the Q.N.’s old place. The Commercial of
Sydney has sprung ahead. The Adelaide has fallen
back considerably ; chaff isn’t the price it was during the
drought which S. Australia mostly missed. There are few
other banks except the Adelaide which don’t show better
figures than in the previous year. The E.S.&A. is the
most conspicuous among these few others.
Some other particulars follow. Banks which
make up their accounts yearly, and those which do so
half-yearly are separated :

Commercial of Australia none on its ordinary
shares. Of those which paid dividends two, the
National of Maoriland and the Westralia, added
more to reserves than they divided. The -'ms. Deposit
and Mortgage is the single shocking example which
divided more than it earned. The Westralia s dividend
largest (174 per cent.); the return on the uew shaies,
premium included, is a little over 7 per cent. Within the
12 months the Australasia, Royal of Melbourne, Union,
Com. of Tasmania, and London raised their dividends., n
no case was a dividend reduced. Not many institution
have had a better year than Australian banks.
A comparison of the profits shown above with
those disclosed at the same period in 1894 (there has been
a lot of allegedly disastrous Democratic legislation since
then) is interesting .

N.S.W. Treasurer Waddell lias come forward
with a scheme for establishing a sinking fund (£400,000 a
year is mentioned) for the reduction of the State’s public
debt, the money “ to be placed under trustees and away
from political interference.” Surely it is about time this
very bad joke was dropped ! The sinking fund idea is a
scheme whereby the country is to keep on borrowing
large sums with one hand, the borrowing being a dead-
sure accomplished fact; while with the other it puts away
small sums for repayment—and after a year or two annexes
the money again. The N.S.W. Parliament can’t pass a
sinking fund law which it isn’t able also to repeal;
nor can it put money in the hands of trustees
without being able also to pass a law for taking
the money out of the hands of trustees. Moreover, as the
State can borrow any amount and for any purpose (pro-
vided it can get the money, and if it offers sufficient inte-
rest it can generally do that), even if £400,000 a year were
paid to the sinking fund, it only means that N.S.W. would
probably borrow £BOO,OOO a year more than usual in order
to celebrate its virtuous action. And after that it would
almost certainly annex the sinking fund in the end. The
first sign of a desire to live a clean and respectable life
should be the abolition of borrowing. Until that is done,
all sinking fund proposals should be received with egg—
superannuated egg.
A dozen M’s.L.A., most of them Labor members
who ought to have known better, raided the N.S.W.
Mines Department last week with a request that the pay-
ments under the Miners’ Accident Fund should be
increased by 25 per cent. They didn’t ask (though it was
all they were promised) that an actuarial investigation
should be made; they simply saw that there was what
looked like a large sum of money in the box, and they
wanted it scattered—among their constituents mostly.
This fund—N.S. Wales’ first State venture in life and acci-
dent assurance business—was established three years ago,
since when its history has been ;
Income. Claims. Expenses. Reserves.
1901 .. £31,906 £6,821 £lOl £24,984
1902 .. 39,036 11,096 1546 51,378
1903 .. 45,559 14,518 1050 81,369
This certainly shows a solid growth of reserves. But the
excess of income over claims and expenses was not profit,
as the deputation seemed to think. Many of the claims
involve the payment of life annuities. At the end of last
year, in addition to 89 widows who are entitled to Bs. per
week as long as they remain unmarried, and 245 children
who are entitled to 2s. 6d. per week till they are 14,
besides other dependent relatives, there were 28 miners
who were permanently disabled and entitled to 12s. a
week for life. Nor is that all ; the claims are also steadily
increasing in number and size. The amount paid out in
respect of fatal and non-fatal accidents per 1000 contribu-
tors since the fund was founded has been :
Fatal. Non-Fatal. Total.
1901 .. £24 17 5 £276 15 5 £3Ol 12 10

1903 .. 177 8 7 431 3 5 608 12 0
And the rapid growth of the outgo, which has more than
doubled itself within two years, continues. At the outset
less than 20 per cent, of the contributions covered the in-
surance claims ; last quarter it required 74J per cent.—an
increase of 6J per cent, on the previous quarter. If, in
view of all this there wasn’t a pretty large accumulation
of funds, the thing would be doomed to insolvency—and
there are not many more pitififl things than a bankrupt
insurance and old-age pension fund. If there is one thing
more than another which isn’t a matter for the politician
to settle it is this question of what an insurance fund is
capable of paying ; and that a tribe of Labor party poli-
ticians should swoop down on a Minister for bigger benefits
just before they (and the Minister) set out on an election
campaign is enough to make a friend of that party
feel sad.

Bit of valuable lack of information from Mel-
bourne Argus -“Nearly every country, at some period
or other of its existence, has been tempted to adopt and
act upon the belief that in some mysterious way a State
bank is calculated to be of untold'benefit. But experi-
menting in this matter has quickly been followed by re-
action in the most civilised nations of the world. Banking
as a department of Government has never proved a
success, and this fact is so well known that in the more
experienced countries no proposal to establish a State
bank would be tolerated. Amongst other things, how-
ever, the Australian Labor - Socialistic party is ill-
informed and rash enough to think that, using
the words ot) the Prime Minister, there are several
ways in which a Commonwealth bank could he
established to the advantage of Australia.” The
Argus apparently never heard of the State Bank of
Sweden, which returns the Government a profit of about
; £llO,OOO a year ; of the State Bank of Norway, and the
State-owned Hypothek Bank (Land Bank) of the same
country ; of the great State-owned Bank of Russia, and
the many State land banks in that and other European
countries; of the State-owned Savings Banks that are
scattered over a multitude of countries; of the State
Bank of South Australia ; of the State-owned Land Bank
in Melbourne ; of the Agricultural Bank in Westralia ; of
the Bank of New Zealand—largely State-owned and wholly
State-managed; of the Maoriland State Land Bank, and of
various other things. But with all this ignorance the
Argus s lout let off the usual high-born sniff at the ill-
informed Labor party because it didn’t share his grievous
lack of a little ordinary human culture. That sniff is the
great weapon in the arsenal of Toryism. Even the party’s
principal luminary is Bruce Sniff.

F. J. 0.: (1) If the agreement was that A was
to provide a certain capital, and he raised the capital
by bank overdraft, it is A and not the firm that
pays the interest. (2) If they start a new partner-
ship, both leaving accumulated profits in the firm
then in fairness neither gets interest on these profits, or
else both do. If the shares and profits are equal, then
there is nothing gained by paying each man interest. If
they are unequal, then it is best that both should get
interest.

The solid old bank has had another remarkably successful
half year ; its earnings on the basis of total funds (capital
£2,000,000 and reserves as at the commencement of the
half-year) have only once been greater since the days of
the financial drunk. On this basis a comparison with
recent results shows :

“Bills in circulation, &c.,” include inner reserves, and
the item has had a large increase—though how much of
it is inner reserves it is, of course, impossible to say.
Deposits are slightly less ; the N.S.W. was one of the two
banks which hesitated to put up the rate of interest until
some time after most others had taken the step, and it
temporarily lost ground in consequence ; in the past half-
year, however, there has been a considerable recovery.
Advances have improved ; and the result of this, com-
bined with a laudable increase in the holding of public
securities, has been to pull down coin reserves a trifle.
Liquid assets are still, however, equal to a solid 35£ per
cent, of total liabilities to the public, and the hard coin
to 19 per cent.

There has been no surplus stock for the co. to freeze, and
current expenses have had to come out of former
undivided profits. In the spring there may, however, be
a few lambs available, so that the current year may
possibly show up a little better than the last two. The
co. has £15,000 of debentures falling due in 1906.

Sydney and suburbs has another example of the
greed of a monopoly. The High Court of Australia
recently decided that the Australian Gaslight Co. is liable
for rates on its mains underneath the streets. Consider-
ing that the co. uses the streets quite as much as the
ordinary ratepayer, for without them it could not run its
pipes, and also that the co. damages the roadway with its
repairs, additions, etc., far more than the general tax-
payer, it is marvellous how it dodged paying rates so
long. Now the monopolistic co. has served notice on all
the borough councils that £1 per annum per street light
is to be charged, in addition to the usual yearly rate.
Some of the councils have compromised with the
Gas Co., others talk of resisting and combining together
to instal electric light. Singly they are helpless against
the rapacity of the co. ; banded together in a Greater
Sydney, the pocket handkerchief boroughs could start
their own lighting scheme. But Sydney slumbers under
the august protection of 44 mayors and about 700 aider-
men, and is split into 44 municipalities, and when
Decimal Nought Two of a city starts arguing with a big
monopoly it hasn’t much of a voice in matters.

The writing down of capital from £915,915 ;to
£547,643 which immediately followed the change
in general managership has allowed the bank
to pay its first div. on ordinary shares since reeon-
struction. Even now, however, it does not look as
though the writing-off has been any too severe, seeing
that, in this past year, which has been a very favorable
one for Australian banks, the earnings amounted to only
£4 2s. 4d. per cent, on shareholders’ funds (capital and
reserves combined), which isn’t as much as is carried by
either the cumulative preference shares (5| per cent.) or
the transferable depose receipts (41, per cent.). Still it is
a very great improvement on what was shown on the old.

No remarkable progress has been made lately in the matter
of getting rid of the heavy burden of old 4J per cent,
deposits. Under the ’97 re-arrangement 10 per cent, had
to be repaid in 1899, 1901, 1903, and 1905, and 30 per cent,
in 1911 and 1917, but it could be repaid sooner at bank s
option. Since 1897 the movement has been

Of course, with ordinary rates for deposits high, there
isn’t the same inducement as there was to wipe out this
debt. So far, while it was obligatory to pay 30 per cent.,
51 per cent, has actually been wiped off. As to ordmaiy
business, the position compares with that of 12 months

The heavy decrease in “Advances, &c. (including
“ other assets ”), is apparently mainly the result of writ-
ing down securities. The liquid assets, which, however,
include bills receivable (the items cannot be distin-
guished), are equal to just over 50 per cent, of the total
liabilities to the public, excluding the old deposits ; in-
cluding them, the liquid assets are equal to 33 per cent.,
which is a very solid reserve indeed.

Block 14, considering its position one of the
most disappointing of Broken Hill mines, seems to have
fair hopes from the southern end, where it joins the B.H.
Prop. For a long while the two co.’s were not too friendly ,
somehow ex-general manager Greenway never hit it with
his neighbors. Now there is a friendlier feeling, and
Block 14’s surveyor and directors have been allowed to
examine the B.H. Prop, workings as close up to the
boundary as they have gone. The lode in there is 60tt.
wide, but is split into three prongs ; and, as far as can be
judged, only one of them has been worked by Block 14.
Of course the lode may have suddenly made back into
one in the latter mine, but in the few feet this is hardly
likely, so there is scope for some vigorous prospecting.
* * * *
Estimate of B.H. Block 10’s ore reserves gives
it 3000 tons a week for eight years—approximately
1,250,000 tons. This is above the 1200 ft. level. Whether,
however, it can all be worked depends on progress made
in metal extraction, on prices of metals, and other things.
Insecurity of portions of the mine has also to be reckoned
with. An estimate of reserves isn’t, therefore, worth
much. A rise of £1 per ton for lead would bring tens of
thousands of tons inside the pay line, and a fall of £1
would carry as much outside it.
Cobar Gold Mines ended a half-year on March
31st with a profit of £20,446 ; so that with the £21,545
made in the previous 12 months, and £4990 brought for-
ward from 1902, it had £46,981 in hand, to be used pre-
sently to equip the mine with the sulphide plant which
will soon be necessary. Present profits are nearly 50 per
cent, of the value of the output, as against about 26 per
cent, during 1902-3. March output was worth £9827 ;
April, £B2o3—reduction being due to smaller quantity and
somewhat poorer value of tailings treated.
Cobar Chesney is to be sold to Great Cobar for
perties are sold within two years. The Ohesney has a
£40,000 cash and another £lO,OOO if the amalgamated pro-
debt of over £20,000, including £19,150 debentures falling
due in a few months ; and it was not at all certain that
the shareholders would part up the £21,000 callable capital
of which from time to time a lot has been said. Something,
therefore, had to be done. The co. has spent £BO,OOO,
and shareholders will get little of it back ; but the loss is
the fault more of the management than of the mine.
Things have been allowed to drift; and the problem
which the property presents (how to treat the hundreds
of thousands of tons of silicious ores available) has never
been tackled in earnest. The mill has been altered time
after time, the last man to be turned on to patch it being
Captain Warren, who is still on the mine. Shares, which
have not lately had buyers even at Is., have been offered
this week at 2s. 6d.; buyers, about Is. 6d. to Is. 9d.

New Hillgrove Proprietary will clean up early
this month. Returns will be up to 1000 or 1200 oz. Mine
is looking well at No. 7 level, but is not opened up suffi-
ciently to crush with three shifts. If mine were properly
opened up battery could easily, crushing, three shifts,
turn out 1500 to 2000 oz. per fortnight. Mine also very
short of firewood ; gangs of men employed on both sides
of inclined tramway cutting wood to keep battery and air
compressor going. Tenders were called for sinking shaft,
but none were accepted. Report locally that sinking was
going on was not correct.
® s * * * *
Baker’s Greek, Hillgrove (N.S.W.) made another
6d. call, payable Bth June. Good gold was struck in
14 and 15 levels last week, said to be worth up to 4oz. to
the ton.
* * * *
Bewick, Moreing and Go. and the directors
continue to do well out of the Great Fingall (W.A.). At
the annual meeting on 20th February, ’O2, directors fees
were increased from £lOOO to £2OOO, while at a recent
meeting directors were granted a bonus of £l5OO. At
1902 meeting staff were donated 1 per cent, on all divs.
declared. This, on last year’s divs., pans out at £2OOO.
Algernon Moreing is both a director and a member of the
staff. The whole 100 stamps are now working, and
output will be materially increased. It came out at the
meeting that the delay in erecting the new 40-head mill
was not caused, as previously stated by the management,
by delays in forwarding, but through some of the
shareholders objecting to its erection near the new shaft
instead of alongside the old battery. Ralph Nichols, of
Boulder Perseverance (now one of B.M.’s staff), was con-
sulted, and he confirmed 8., M. and Oo.’s action. No
reason was given, but the reason for the change is this ;
The mill is erected on the hanging wall of the lode, and
may sink at any time, but also may not, as reef is nearly
400 ft. below. If mill sinks, it will be condemned as out-
of-date. If it doesn’t, everything will be O.K. The dis-
tance between the two mills is 500 ft. Mine is now orna-
mented with the original 20-head erected by the Australian
co., the old 40-head erected by the Bull co., the newer 60-
head, and the newest 40-head. In fact, there are batteries
everywhere, a monument to incapable management in the
past. Ore reserves are now estimated at 475,000 tons,
worth 25-Bdwt., so that divs. are well assured for a long
time ahead. Both the 9 and 10 levels are opening up very
well, and the reef continues its width. It seems incred-
ible that such a co. “ went bung ” in 1899 after treating
19,303 tons for 16,5320 z., an average of 17dwt. It started
in 1897 with a working capital of £39,469, and won in two
years £75,000 worth of gold, and yet wound up £lB,OOO in
debt. That must surely be a record of mismanagement.
* * * *
Golden Pole, Davy hurst (W.A.), which expected
to get its mill going shortly, has had another disappoint-
ment. One of the two Government wells, which were
calculated to give at least 15,000ga1. a day each, has sud-
denly petered out, and water now percolates through at
the rate of only 20gal. an hour. If the other well, a mile
away, suddenly follows suit, things will be very cold at
the Pole. The Waihi, which is next the Pole, will not
have much use for the projected mill, for which directors
will probably be thankful. They can afford to wait till
stone is developed, if ever it is, which is doubtful.
* * * *
Associated, Kalgoorlie, has got its main shaft
down to 1600 ft., so is in a good position to operate on the
Oroya chute. As the depth or height of this chute has
been so far about 200 ft., it will probably be bottomed at
1200 ft. on the northern boundary, and gradually dip
south. The finding of this chute must have cost
co. a pretty penny, as 1000 ft. was driven to locate it.
Co. is to follow chute with an inclined winze a la Associ-
ated Northern and Oroya. It is probably the cheapest
way, as it entails no dead work, and ensures the gold
reaching the pockets of shareholders by the most direct
route. Future of co. seems now fairly well assured.
* * * *
Northern Boulder shaft, which is down_ 1100 ft.,
is being deepened to 1200 ft., from which further explora-
tions will be made. As here previously stated, property
is worthless, and it looks like throwing good money after
bad to persevere, where there are no indications of success,
but very much the reverse. The Oroya East (adjoining on
the north) cross-cut right across its lease at 1000 ft., while
the Brown Hill Extended, on the north of the Oroya East,
cross-cut 6Soft. from 700 ft. level, both quite fruitlessly.
The market is still unsettled regarding No. 2
S. Great Eastern (Gympie), which has been keeping up its
output by going to its amalgam reserves as long' as the re-
serves lasted. There have been fluctuations of nearly £1
in a day. Best feature in the case is that, after paying
current div. and bonus (in all £10,800), co. will have
£13,000 cash, besides gold on the bottom plates. As to
the mine, no change has occurred ; the rich specimen
stone is still mostly missing.
* * * *
The bump in Q. S.G. Easterns, Gympie, has been
followed by something of the same sort with the Towers’
jeweller’s shop, Queen’s Cross ; shares have fallen from
465. to 355. in a month, apparently with more to follow.
Those who saw the Q. Cross wobble some weeks back,
and remembered ancient history, stood from under quick
and lively. A lot of Cross shares are held in England
and France, and the baby may have to be nursed in the
Cold Country. ■

- Latest advices from London forecast a further
patching-up of Chillagoe Railway and Mines. Bulletin’s
forecast that Keats, on arrival in London, would talk about
the necessity for more money, and picture the possibilities
of the Etheridge goldfield if it had a railway, was correct.
In view of the attitude of the Queensland Govt, on the
Etheridge railway guarantee, and the withdrawal of
Bewick-Moreing from that field, it looks as if large
London debenture-holders will “ kid” shareholders to pu
up some more cash for development, for at the meeting in
London debenture-holders are privately cabled to have
been quite friendly. It is certain the debenture-holders
will not save the co. for the shareholders, whatever the
shareholders may do for the debenture-holders,

Auditors of Madame Berry West (Vic.) tack on
to the stereotyped report on the half-year’s accounts
“The mine manager informs us that he keeps no secret;
reserve gold.” Mining isn’t what it ought to be m Vic.
when it becomes necessary for a co. to say this. Co. s
half-year’s work (to May 16th) gave £15,415 gold and
£ll5B profit ; it has a balance of £ll7O. Total gold to
date, £398,357 from Nos. 1 and 2 shafts ; £75,110 from
No. 3. Divs., £71,687. The West Loughlin lease « show-
ing some good ground, and prospects are middling.
From first to last this economically managed co. has spent
in office, administration, and general expenses only
£ll7s. per cent, of the receipts. #
Directors of Berry Extended, Creswick (Vic.),
ought to know better than to declare a div. when funds
were not sufficient to pay for it. The “assay ’’money
balance ought to have been in hand first. Anyway, only
a small balance was left even when that was counted in.
* * * •
Great Southern, Bendigo, after a long spell, has
got out of debt and is paying divs. Money for it comes
from 870 ft., near Ulster boundary.
* * * *
New Dempsey (Vic.) balance-sheet wasn’t so
bad as was expected, yet shares went hang. Dirt averaged
lOdwt., and gave a profit of about 7s. a ton. Two divs.
of Is. each paid during half year, but only one earned.
Co. carries forward over £lOOO. What caused uneasiness
was that only six months’ crushing stuff is in sight, and
that does not justify shares being at 14s. If stone was
struck at No. 2 level, the whole complexion would be
altered. That’s why brokers won’t spec, scrip as they
used. Not that they like Dempseys, as they have lost
money over every deal in them.
* * * *
Russell Reef, Lauriston (Vic.), shares are
wobbling a lot. Speckers know holders are weakly, and
that if the least change takes place in the north face of
mine they will have the game in their hands. Pity it
should be so. Co. wants ground opened up before it can
stand any market stress.
* * * *
From a man who was there : Bowes Kelly
didn’t take the chair at the Mt. Lyell meeting. Perhaps
he thought the air would be cooler at the Broken Hill
smelters. Anyway, he went thither, leaving Knox to do
the um-ing and the ah-ing. Shareholders looked anxious,
and so did one or two spec-sellers, who were nervous that
Sticht’s estimates would be stated to be an under-valua-
tion. Knox never diverged from the text of the directors’
or Sticht’s reports, save once when he told of a couple of
small strikes at the North Lyell. Some of the speckers
smiled when “Sandy” Oliver rose to fire off a care-
fully-prepared list of questions, and asked who had
got them up for him. Knox’s countering was as
good as anything he has yet done. _ Perhaps the
remembrance of Chillagoe was in his mind. He stuck
to Sticht, as stoutly as Dowie sticks to hell. “ What we
have, we have” was his cry, and he lived up to it. No
one else spoke. The least crumb of comfort would have
changed the tone of everything, but the one man who
could have given it was absent at Broken Hill, and Sticht,
who should have been there, went away because he
doesn’t like public meetings. Recent estimates of Mt.
Lyell, therefore, stand till the next half-year, when Sticht
ought to be made to give No. 2 report.

A visit to the Engineering works of Mephan
Ferguson, at Footscray, Victoria, fully repays the little
trouble taken. The works cover 10 acres of ground, and
up-to-date machinery is being constantly added to cope
with any description of work which may be ordered. The
electric welding plant, and machines for making spiral
rivited pipes are kept fully employed. Amongst works
now in course of construction are bridges for Victorian
Railways, boilers for Dalgety and Go., engine for Werry
Engine Co., accumulator and Hydraulic steam pump for
Pioneer India Rubber Works.*

August, 1003“ During the past year the Colonial
Mutual Life Assurance Society’s business was thoroughly
progressive, and a substantial addition was made to the

£110,960 and brought up the totaLfunds to £2,706,830.*
The McDermott Sizer now on the market is
rapidly coming into favor with mining men. Useful as
this machine is, there is no intention of claiming that by
the use of it it becomes possible to save by concentration
all of the mineral values in ore. Some loss is bound to
occur, no matter what mechanical methods are employed,
but what is claimed is that by the use of the Sizer, the
pulp can be prepared in a manner more suitable and in
such a way as to materially increase the efficiency of the
concentrating plant. Nor must it be conjectured that
the McDermott Sizer is only for use in conjunction with
Wilfley Tables; although it acts admirably with those
machines, it is of such general application as to enable
it to be used with equal advantage with whatever type of
dressing machine happens to be employed. Those wishing
for more information in regard to this useful machine can
obtain catalogues and full particulars from the Austral
Otis Engineering Company of South Melbourne, who are
the Agents and Sole Manufacturers of the machine.*

Hamilton (Vic.) district is blessed with a

man, and in ancient days would have been drowned or
strangled, which was a good way of dealing with them.

“ Burglar Bill ” : Be Dowie’s remarks
about the Brotherhood of Enslaved Bricklayers
interfering with the Fount of Justice. Met one
of the order in gaol who blasphemed vigorously
because he made the distress signal to His Honor
from the dock and received back a sentence of four
years—a particularly heavy one—for mere bigamy.
I hinted at weak eyesight, and urged him to advo
cate a detachable distress signal that one could
take off and post to the presiding Judge so as to
make a certainty of the matter.

Terrible are the pen pictures drawn of the
effects of modern implements of war. Quick-
firing guns, machine guns, and all sorts of guns,
lyddite, dynamite and other ‘ ‘ ites ” are to make
future wars a holocaust which modern writers
tremble to describe. Yet the battle of the Yalu,
cabled out with a blast of gory adjectives and
a shriek of creepy headlines, has ended in the
awful losses on both sides coming out at about 3000
or 4000 killed and wounded. It looks rather as if
the multiplication of fearsome weapons will
go on till nobody is killed at all. Perhaps in
course of time war will be rather an aid to the
birth-rate, and the victorious party will be the one
with most twins on the field of battle.

“F.” : Apropos that Fatman’s objection
(B. 12/5/’O4). The Liverpool (N.S.W.) Asylum
was built half a century and more before the
Liverpool railway was thought of. At one time
the Liverpudlians agitated to get rid of the
Asylum and its inmates. That, however, was
after the inmates were prohibited from parading
the streets of the backward old town and spending
cadged ‘ ‘ trays ’’ in the pub bars. At one time a
humorous porter at Granville used to call out on
the arrival of the trains, “ Change here for Liver-
pool Asylum.” A well-connected derelict who
used the asylum in the winter months objected to
this and complained, and there was an ejected
porter.
Woman suffragists should urge all Aus-
tralian Legislatures to follow the example of the
S.A. State Parliament, which has replaced its
male waiters by women. Already one S.A. mem-
ber has married a waitress.
A BLOCKADE RUNNER.
THE ANCIENT : “ Wot yer got to ’owl about, kid ? Guess, the way things is, yer lucky to get

Some recent clever burglaries are reminis-
cent of Keck, who was governor of Darlinghurst
gaol in the d«ys when Deas-Thompson was
Colonial Secretary of N.S.W. The aristocracy
of Potts and Darling Points were being plundered
a couple of nights a week, and the Commissioner
of Police swore vigorously at the detectives for
not catching the burglars. But how could they,
when the robbers, after doing their work, returned
to Darlinghurst gaol and delivered the loot to
Keck. The governer of the gaol had four master
burglars on his hands, whose operations he
directed. When the scandal broke upon the
Government, Keck got the kick out from Darling-
hurst, but was appointed Clerk of the Markets.
The Government was afraid to make the comic
horror public and face the shriek of ridicule.
Another fine subject for an Australian story is
the rum and tobacco smuggling romance of the
“Forty Thieves,” who ostensibly re-shipped from
bond the heavy-duty goods to Maoriland; the
vessels unloaded on a handy spot on the N.S.W.
coast, and the uncustomed rum and tobacco were
brought back by bullock drays to Sydney. The
syndicate of pious and moral merchants, who
became known as “The Forty Thieves,” netted
about £5OO a week each by their frauds while the
business lasted.

The noble Maori in law and war. A Maori
witness was called before the Supreme Court at
Auckland lately. He requested the services
of an English interpreter. The Crown Pro-
secutor remarked to the Maori—-“ Now, look
here, you understand English well enough; ”
and without waiting for the interpreter
to acquaint him with the observation, the
Maori excitedly denied knowing a word
of the language. Another native who joined
a mounted rifle corps, for which he would
have to find his own horse, saddle and
bridle, procured the two inanimate articles
by robbing a store of them. He was iden-
tified by the discovery of gum on his
feet, which corresponded to that from
an overturned gum bottle in the shop in i
which the footprints were found. The
prints reproduced a peculiar formation
on one of the prisoner’s feet. By gum
was he discovered. And he got two
years’ hard instead of commendation for
his zeal in wanting to be a soldier of the
King !

Financial bungling is chronic at the Uni-
versity of Melbourne. For over thirty years not
a penny was spent on the Bourke-street property
which belongs to the Dwight bequest. After the
antiquarian bookseller’s death his shop, next to
the Old White Hart, was opened as a small book
arcade by Cole. Then Josh Syme, the Free-
thought firebrand, located himself in the historic
shop with the defunct Liberator. The property
was then already in an advanced stage of decay,
and some Roman Catholic fanatics finally wrecked
the building in retaliation for an attack by Syme
on Archbishop Carr. Next, the City Council con-
demned the premises, and for five or six years no
rent was received by the University authorities,
who would not spend £2OO or £3OO on repairs to
the two shops, losing thereby more than £l5OO.
The Fat papers of Victoria circulated the
half-lie, when the Gippsland coal-strike was
flickering out from sheer starvation, that the
union officers had been drawing salaries as well as
strike pay through all the long 16 months of hope-
less struggle. Even the Age was graceless enough
to say that “probably the leaders were the only
ones who made anything out of the contest.” The
whole truth was that, in order to make them
legally responsible for the faithful handling of the
large sums with which they had to deal, both
secretary and treasurer continued to draw their
handsome allowance of £5 per year ! The strike
pay which they drew like the rest panned out at
an average of 12s. 3d. per week. They will pro-
bably buy motor-cars with what they saved out of
that.

The committee of the belated Melbourne
Infectious Diseases Hospital is just now wonder-
ing what it can best do with the £750 that
remains on hand. The building is completed, but
it has no furniture and fittings for the accommoda-
tion of patients, and now, instead of taking active
measures to raise more money, the men who have
so scandalously fooled with their responsibility are
proposing to open the Hospital on as small a scale
of usefulness as £750 will permit.

Out of the 69 cases listed in Melbourne
Divorce Court this session, there were only 10
decorated with a co-respondent. The petitioner,

THE OLD DAYS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. John Gardiner, secretary of the Employers’ Union,
in giving evidence before the Arbitration Court, Sydney,
on May 27, in reference to the bricklayers’ dispute, said :
“If I had had no more push in me in my early days than
the men of the present time, I would not be in the posi-
tion I am in to-day.”
’Tis a terrible reflection—one on which I fear to dwell—
Though the fact, alas ! is very plain to me,
That there’s nothing in the universe, from Heaven down
Hell,
Which is quite as good as once it used to be !
I can ne’er forget the sun we had some forty years ago,
And the silver moonbeams shining on the sea.
Ah, my heart is almost broken ’neath the weight of tons
of woe
When I think about the things that used to be.
I often sigh and sorrow for those happy days of yore,
When each planet ran it’s due and proper course ;
In those days we’d always something that was well worth
living for,
If we only hanged a man who stole a horse.
But the times when every servant-girl could chop her load
of wood
Have departed through our socialistic laws.
And the working-man (like all things else) we find is not
as good
As he used to be —in fact he never was !
I agree with Mr. Gardiner. He and I were blithe and gay
In the good old years when no one “ missed the ’bus ” —-
’Twas our energy that won for us the place we hold to-
day,
But we search in vain for men to follow us !
Every man, of old, was thrifty and was bent on keeping so
And resolved he would succeed in life ; and how !
And the working-class were all contented forty years ago.
That is why they crave for old-age pensions now !
In the good old times of long ago when John and I were
young,
We were most tremendous fellows in our way ;
We had lots of brains and energy and never mixed among
The incapables we see around to-day.
We did our duty fearlessly, and thus succeeded well,
And it fills our hearts with sorrow when we see
That there’s nothing up in heaven, on the earth, or down
in hell,
That is quite as good as once it used to be !

Throe Melbourne work-girls had a narrow
escape from a gruesome decease t’other week.
They were employed at a small suburban factory
(in the woollen-knitting line) where the female
boss is up to all possible infringements of the Fac-
tories Act. On this occasion the Health Inspector
arrived very suddenly, but the surprise was not
quite sudden enough for him to get evidence of
overcrowding. Before he got to the workroom four
girls were pushed into a wardrobe, and the boss
turned the key on them and put it in her pocket,
expecting, of course, that their imprisonment
would be only a matter of five minutes, at the
longest. The Inspector probably suspected some-
thing wrong, or perhaps he was merely in a restful
mood. Anyhow, he stayed three-quarters of an hour
in that room, yarning with the anxious law-breaker,
whilst the four girls were silently fighting for
breath in their stuffy place of concealment. As
the moments passed on, and never a groan nor a
cough was heard from the hidden ones, the rest
of the factory grew horribly afraid, and broke
out into a profuse perspiration. At last the
Inspector went away to get some fresh air.
Having seen him off the premises, the boss
rushed to open the wardrobe. Four apparently
dead bodies fell out upon the floor, and the other
girls mostly went into hysterics, or fainted right
away. The factory was strewn with the forms of
unconscious workers. Luckily the asphyxiated
quartette were restored to life after a while, and
in consideration of their self-sacrificing conduct
the boss paid them for the time they had
remained idle in that wardrobe. She stopped
nothing from their day’s wages.

The stranding of the steamer Workfield in
Sydney Harbor, last week, was a case of shocking
bad luck for the skipper. Just as the vessel was
ready for sea, a navigation inspector drew the
captain’s attention to his Plimsoll marks, which
were submerged, thus showing the ship to be over-
loaded. This, especially in the case of a collier
like the Workfield, was a serious matter, but, to
the consternation of the inspector, the skipper
announced his intention of going to sea all the
same, marks or no marks. The inspector
served him with a formal notice, which only had
the effect of quickening the sea-going prepara-
tions. The inspector then sought the assistance
of the customs officer, who promptly withdrew
the ship’s “clearance.” The captain thereupon
intimated that he was off to sea, clearance or no
clearance. As a last resource, the inspector
and the customs officer appealed to the
pilot, who at once declined to take the
vessel down the harbor. The skipper here
announced that jhe was going away, pilot or no
pilot, and off he went, breaking in one act more
laws than the average citizen breaks in his life-
time. The allies were left on the wharf, dancing
with rage and battered dignity. But the skipper
didn’t know the channel, and when off Chowder
Bay ingloriously stuck in the mud. The chagrin
of the officials was replaced by an intense joy,
and all hands rushed round to take out warrants,
summonses, and all sorts of papers, notices and
infuriated documents.
A MEMORY.
BIGLY, M.P. (with enthusiasm): “Good memory?
Should think I have. Never forgot another
fellow’s umbrella in my life.”
Maoriland may be an aggressively moral
place, but advertisements like this— from a
Wellington paper—don’t look like it: —
•WANTED, a single woman or lady with £5O (or
" ' more) for a single tradesman, for housekeeping,
with view of marriage. Address Tradesman, P. 0.,
Johnsonville.
He doesn’t mind whether she is a woman or a
lady, so long as she has £5O or more and is willing
to keep house.
The Maoriland Divorce Court struggled
through a melodrama at Wellington lately.
The two principals were married away back
in 1877, but years later
the man left suddenly.
He continued in that
state so thoroughly
that the lady, the
petitioner in the
Divorce Court
case, came to
the conclusion
that he was
dead, and mar-
ried again.
Then, when the
second husband
died, the firs
husband turned
up quite alive.
He was a sheep-
farmer by this
time, and
among the
fleece - pickers
he put on at
one shearing
was his own
son. The
youngster, of
course, didn’t
know him; but
yarns about ‘ 4 the
old man” told in
the huts put him on
the trail, and led a
lady who thought she
was two widows to the
discovery that she wasn’t
even one widow. According
to all the rules of the drama,
the long-parted husband and
wife should now have edged on
to the middle of the stage, and
there fallen into one another’s
arms, while the son embraced
the wealthy daughter of some
adjacent magnate. But it didn’t
turn out anything like that; it
was simply reported that the sheep-
farmer had a Maori lady to keep
him company when last heard
from, and was apparently best
satisfied to leave it at that, and
a decree nisi closed the pro- «
ceedings.
This quaint notice was published in the
Adelaide Advertiser of May 16 :
TF the people of Glanville do not leave off scandalis-
ing me about beating my wife, as such statements
are not true, further proceedings will he taken.
CHARLES BOWMAN, Glanville.
This is how London Daily Express
jingoes over the insolence of the Thibetans in
standing in the way of a force invading their
country :
The Thibetans have insisted on war. The ringleader
was the representative of the Golden Monastery, who paid
the penalty of his crime with his life. For it was nothing
less than a crime to incite an undisciplined mob of
Thibetans to fire on the 23rd Sikh Pioneers and the Bth
Gurkhas —the very flower of the Indian army. It is as
though a flock of sheep hutted a group of lions, and it
speaks in highest praise of the discipline of our men that
the whole force was not exterminated. Nothing stirs the
fury of gallant fighting men so madly as to be wantonly
shot down by people they despise.
To this has the old tradition of British fair-play
and British courage descended—a hint that the
nigger fighting Britain’s battles would be more
than half justified in exterminating, in case of
resistance, the other colored person whose home he
has invaded. It surpasses in shame even Seddon’s
Maori cannibal threat during the Boer war. Can
a country be sane and sound and strong at heart
which tolerates such hysterical blood-yelling in
its responsible press?

For some months past a harmless-looking
individual has been parading Adelaide with a
bundle of newspapers and periodicals under
his arm. He comes out at about 10 o’clock and
walks about all day without, apparently, being
able to pluck up sufficient courage to ask anyone
to buy his wares. He has never yet been seen to
sell anything. He disappears at about 10 o’clock at
night. Apropos of wanderers, for some days an
inebrious-looking woman meandered about the
Holy City with three or four pages of an atlas in
her hand. She only lasted a short time and then
disappeared. Evidently she was looking for the
Federal Capital site.

“ Hiphen ” : From time to time The
Bulletin has unearthed various Australian re-
cords, such as, amongst others, the tiredest man,
the thirstiest man, and the meanest man. I hold
that this last record is broken with a dull thud.
The distinction belongs to one, or all, of the Box
Hill bank burglars. The man who, after lifting
£1750, takes a poor bank clerk down for 3s. and a
tin watch deserves to be boiled alive in cold beer.

‘ £ D. ” : Was spectator once of the manoeu-
vres of a N.S.W. country Mounted Infantry
corps, which was being put through its movements
by a visiting drill instructor with a lurid nose.
He brought the detachment
into line about 50 yards in
front of a waterhole, hiccupped
twice, and said “ Charge ! ”
Then he turned round and con-
templated the horizon in an
opposite direction. The squad
charged, but as the men came
near the pit they slackened
speed and halted of their own
accord about three yards from
the brink. The instructor
walked across and read them
a most violent lecture on dis-
obedience, informing them that
“a true British soldier never
questioned the wisdom of a
superiah.” Then a long, lean
soldier, who was honorary vet.
or head horse-shoer to the corps,
spoke. He didn’t say much—
merely told the instructor that
he was a beer-sodden incapable
with a nose like the glare of
a burning public-house. When
he had finished he disbanded
himself and rode off the field. The astounded officer
walked under the shade of a tree to consult a rule-
book and see what could be done to the lanky
private who called him a public-house, but he fell
asleep under the tree and when he awoke the
forces were gone.

“Petramos” (a patriotic citizen) : Stood for
a while on the evening of May 23rd, and watched
the late Queen Victoria’s beloved subjects decor-
ating her marble effigy in Adelaide. The
loyal people comprised a lady school teacher with
a pair of spectacles, a tall,-pretty girl in a scarlet
blouse, and a score of school girls of various ages.
The school teacher and the girl in red bravely
lifted a ladder, and leant it against the figure of
our late sovereign. Then a youth came forward,
shook hands with the lady in specs., raised his hat
gingerly all round, and commenced to climb the
ladder. It is a high pedestal, and he had to grasp
Queen Victoria’s ankle to haul himself up. Then,
with great taste, he decorated the bronze figure,
clinging to various parts of its anatomy as he
gracefully placed about it a lot of vegetable growth.
It is a fairly high statue, and between the inter-
vals of watching the girl in the red blouse I found
time to wonder whether, if he fell, his corpse
would be called a hero. At last it was all over,
and a score of patriots had paid their second
annual tribute to Victoria. They stood off a bit
to admire the effect, whilst the stream of men
passing by wondered vaguely what it was all
about.
“ F.” meets with a dead body to which he
hadn’t been introduced :
Mention of the fact that corpses are carried by ordinary
passenger trains on the Yic. railways (a special train for
each occasional dead passenger would be an awful ex-
pense, anyhow) reminds me of one evening when I was
travelling in the guards’ van of a Frankston (Melb.) train,
and a coffin (loaded) was taken aboard at South Yarra.
For the moment a silence—a dead silence—came over the
ten or twelve inmates of that van. Several hard-faced
citizens, who had been smoking, gazed uneasily at the
black box and removed their pipes from their mouths.
None of us seemed to know how we ought to be affected
by the presence of a strange body in our midst. Then I
grew conscious of being regarded as the chairman of the
meeting, so to speak, owing to my position at the head of
the coffin, which—strange to say—had no friend or rela-
tive of the deceased in attendance. My feet were jammed
against the far-side door of the van, and this solemn piece
of furniture lay longways in front of me. The company
was waiting for its cue—sentimental humbug or rational
“ callousness.” “Isit a man or a woman ? ” said Ito the
guard. “A woman,” he answered. The train stopped.
This was the station for me to alight at, and in squeezing
my way out of the crowded van I had to put one foot
lightly on the coffin. “ Well, chaps,” said I to the hard-
faced cits., “ I guess the lady doesn’t object to smoking.”
They laughed. I left them all laughing. “ Callousness ”
was the cue they had been hoping for. In a world where
people are dying, or getting buried, every minute of every
day, why go through a form of reverence for the hidden
body of an unknown person that has been pushed into
one’s company on a suburban train like any other sort of
luggage ? Nevertheless, I take some credit to myself for
moral courage in having ventured to express the real
public sentiment on the occasion aforesaid. The social
rule is to joke about death behind its back and make a
hypocritical (or craven-spirited ?) show of reverence in its
presence, even when it has no more claim to harrow our
feelings than the presence of death in Timbuctoo.
That old and valued contributor c ‘ Hiphen ”
writes for “ two bob ” :
With much reluctance I am about to ask a favor of you.
Could you oblige me with the loan of 2s. till pay day? Let
me tell you my sad story—’twould wring pity from a
pawnbroker. I have a girl. Some time ago I promised
to take her to the Homoeopathic Hospital ball, where she
was to make her debut. As the time came near, however,
I side-tracked her off the dance by a promise of a treat at
the wax-works. But last evening, with tears in her
eyes, she showed me the following, which she had cut
from the Argus of the 23rd inst. :
“ In connection with the Homoeopathic Hospital ball, on
Wednesday evening next, it has been arranged that at the
conclusion of their set the debutantes shall be presented
to Mrs. Madden.”
Now I ask you, how can I refuse her a chance like that?
To be presented to Mrs. Chief Justice Madden ! For the
trifling sum of ss. ! Alas ! I have only managed to save
up Bs. All I want is another florin for two tickets.
Think how grand it will be to look back upon in years to
come ; to tell the children “ Your mother was presented
to Mrs. Chief Justice Madden for five bob.” Try and
oblige me. I think you are the nicest paper I know.
Send along that oouple o’ bob. It’s Mrs. Madden,

to that extent —but we forget; no self-praise.

THE BIRTH-RATE CRAZE.

Last week I saw
A seething crowd
With hats and hair awry,
All push and shove,
And gasping loud —-
“ An accident ? ” said I.
Now being of
A morbid mind,
Swift through the surging flood
fought my way,
In hope to find
At least a pool of blood.
“ Oh, where is he ?
And what’s his name ?
Who did it, how and when ? ”
A woman fat
Said, “ Lor, for shame?
Surprised at yer, you men ! ”
And then I saw
What caused the crowd
To gaze with awe and joy ;
Within the arms
Of father proud
Keposed a baby boy.

BY THE WAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh ! the dew lay white on the roadside grass,
And they hurried to look at the soldiers pass.
The music was gay and the colors bright,
And the young girl gazed with a keen delight.
“ Look, mother,” she said, “ where their steps have been
The grass has taken a brighter green.”
But she saw as they came from the fields oppressed,
At noon to the roadside to eat and rest,
Where the troops had trampled, the grass was dead,
From the roadside blossoms the life had fled.
And the mother said, “ I have lived and seen
Nought thrives but rue where a soldier’s been.”

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, May 31, 1904.
Mr Deak Akini
His Excellency and the Lady Northcote, 5.1.,
(note the “the,” please, and the affixes. One who
holds the position at Government House that St.
Pe;er does at the Pearly Gates impresses upon
folks the importance of speaking and writing of
her Ex. in this fashion) —well their Excellencies
visited our National Gallery last week and spent
ftn hour and a half amongst the pictures. The
lady at least cle irly knew what she was talking
of when she discussed painters and their works.
She specially admired Peter Graham’s “Rising
Mists” and two water-colors of Copley Fielding,
and both their Ex.’s guardedly praised our
Australian painters’ works. Both Northcotes
are greatly interested in the engravings of
old masters that Angus and Robertson are selling.
“Imagine,” exclaimed the Lady, “a hundred
copies of these famous examples for five pounds—
a shilling a copy ! lam buying a set to hang on
the staircase wall at Government House.”
In Moore and Bridge streets, Sydney possessed
two broad, straight thoroughfares in which it was
possible for one to turn round without being jabbed
in the eye by a barber’s pole, or rammed by a
peanut merchant’s wheelbarrow. Now, the City
Council has planted a row of electric light-posts
down the middle of each street, just by way of
blocking them up a bit. Seemingly the Sydney
Council can never see a good broad street or an
open space anywhere without being seized with
an irresistible lmging to block it up with a lamp-
post or a dog-box, or something.
Mrs. G. B. Lewis (Rose Edouin of the old days)
took Miss Susie Vaughan’s place in “Raffles” at
Her Majesty’s on Saturday night, and wore the
“ancestral jewels” and did the staircase act with
as much grace if less bulk than the towering Susie.
Susie is such a little name for such a large lady.
She ought to be Judith. Miss Vaughan’s time
with J. C. Williamson is up and she has gone
hence by the India. Her flat at “ Cromer,” her
steam-launch trips over our harbor, and her good
salary were good-bye-ed regretfully. Actors and
actresses as a class have somehow got the name of
being great wasters and spendthrifts. The charge
may have been justified in the past; if so the
mummer disposition has changed lately, for it now
makes for exceeding thriftiness.
The Cuyler Hastings co. hoards its gains as
squirrels lay up nuts for winter. It wouldn’t
spend a cab-fare, of its own money, if walking
could take it to its destination, and it mostly lives
in 255. a-week boardinghouses. It accepts all the
tony hospitality offered it, and, being a bird of
passage, doesn’t give a feather in return. There
is no country in the world where visiting artists
are better treated than Australia. The fat.
cheerful contralto who came here with the Edward
Lloyd co. told me that her eyes were getting a
chronic bulge of surprise at the disinterested
generosity of the friends she made here. “ I have
only to wish for a thing in Australia,” she re-
marked, “and provided it’s not too wild an
aspiration, I am pretty sure to have it before I’m
many hours older.”
Certain members of the Bland Holt Co., dressed
as unobtrusively as drab moths, dine economically
at a modest restaurant in Sydney and “sleep
themselves” somewhere else. Mummers, male and
female, are now as circumspect as curates and
visiting governesses. The star of the co. will
probably live at the Australia or at a club, or,
as Maud Jeffries does, take a furnished bijou cot-
tage. Otherwise folks might say that her
salary was not a thousand a week. The beauty-
actor usually repays the sock-mendings of the star-
struck maids at his hotel with free passes to the
theatre or with his photograph.
Talking of Maud Jeffries: her fianct’s people
are deluging him with remonstrations about
his matrimonial choice. They want to know
how ever he can expect such a bird of Paradise to
settle down to isolated station life. And he won’t
be rich enough—not for a good many years—to
permit much skipping to and fro for himself and
wife on the face of the earth. If the lady is much
in love, and if her mental resources are not very
limited, she may, however, stand life on a selec-
tion. She may write “Maud and her Australian
Station,” after the model of “Elizabeth and her
German Garden.”
Mrs. Lewis, by the way, is to start teaching
here. Several of her pupils are on the stage.
That little Gleeson who played “Tweeny” and
“ Bessie Broke ” is one of them. Another is the
phenomenon who plays the little Lord Fauntleroy
in the Hawtrey co. Since the loss of her con-
siderable fortune in sinister ’93, the plucky woman
has been constantly instructing the young idea
how to shout when it sees its pa’s ghost suddenly
on the ramparts of Elsinore.
A branch (women’s) of N.S.W. Public Instruc-
tion Department gave a social, the other day, and
extended its invitations to the Departmental
bosses, among them the Chief Inspector and his
wife. The Chief Inspector has been recently
appointed, and has not forgotten the fact. At 9
p.m. the committee breathed freely when they
realised that he was not coming. But they were
later thrown into confusion by the arrival of a
Departmental messenger, “That Mr. and Mrs.
had attended as requested, but finding no one
to receive them had been constrained to leave
again. ” Perhaps the Chief Inspector had looked for
a triumphal arch, a guard of honor from the public
school cadets, or at least a double file of teachers
on all fours. Anyhow the demure committee girl,
whose business it was to announce the arrivals,
had never even seen the Chief Inspector come, let
alone hear him snort. The teachers, when thev
received the bomb, boldly consulted Minister for
Education Perry, who had arrived with his dignity
intact. The Minister received the news as a
hilar lous joke, and comforted the committee by
assuring them that he would personally soothe the
injured potentate.
Dili Macky’s home on Church Hill is now a
boarding-house, and its landlady is advertising.
But she doesn’t stipulate for strict Presbyterian
boarders. Report says that a white-hot R.C. pay-
guest occupies Dill’s bedroom, and has a shrine
to one of the saints where the portrait of John
Knox used to hang.
A prosperous-looking audience crowded the
Lyceum on Saturday night for opening of “The
Rose of the Riviera.” Management advertised
the prices “as very decollete.” So are many of
the performers’ dresses. When the batch of bare-
footed and bare-legged stage beauties came on, a
man leaning over the back of the circle gasped
“O, de-col-letty legs as well! ” The girls really
looked conscious that naked feet did not suit
them. A foot that wears a No. 4 shoe looks a No.
6 foot when in a state of nature. Some of the
feet had been “made up,” pinked toes, polished
nails, and a high light on the instep.
All the same, they had a hind-paw look. If bare
feet as a stage-fashion are coming in, girls had
better learn to do something that will give their
feet a chance to increase m symmetry. May
Beatty,_ as the “Rose” of the frisky watering
place, simulates in her short skirts the petals and
hues of a red rose. The crescented layers of
fluffy frock shade from pale pink to deep crimson.
There are some venial sin thrills to be got from
the black and scarlet dressing; it makes you think
of the Satanic trade-mark on devilled ham-pots.
When Miss Garstang, as the Duchess of Clapham,
gets into a robe of violet velvet and ermine, and
assumes a diamond coronet, she looks more regal
than the Empress of Russia or the wife of the
colored President of Hayti. But her dirty-fawn
kid gloves—perhaps they are part of the English
“push” joke.
The scenic background of the Riviera view—
the half-circle of blue sea, the strip of white sand
and _ the red-tiled villas on the hill slopes—makes
a picture startlingly like our Rose Bay. The
very houses correspond to those we know from
the sea. There is Kelly’s place a-gaze over the
blue, and Jack Toohey’s house, and Monty
Severn’s mansion looking contemplatively down
the green forest, the villa where Francis Suttor of
the beautiful legs lived awhile ago, and the
Waleys’ place.
Th 3 laying of the foundation stone of the new
C.iildren’s Hospital by her Ex. Northcote was
postponed from the rainy Wednesday of last
week to the (possibly) dry Wednesday of this week.
Harold W. Fairfax, hon. sec., was afraid the stone
would get wet or that her Ex- would get cold.
Many an important person has caught a bad cold
through laying a damp stone.
The new ebony and silver-mounted brushes,
combs, glove-boxes and mirrors that are on view
at Stewart Dawson’s must be in keeping with the
latest fashion freak in Paris that of black
boudoirs. These b.b.’s are designed as back-
grounds for women “with coppery hair and white
satin skins.” No doubt the lady possessing these
peculiar charms (and a black boudoir) would like
to brush her coppery locks with a jet black brush
that has a design in silver and her monogram on
the back. _ Stewart Dawsons are also exhibiting
a replica in solid silver of the noted “Armada”
j ug. It is a marvellous piece of carving. Flowers,
figures, scrolls, leopards’ heads, and various de-
signs are carved with a delicacy and accuracy that
would stand examination under a lens.
A piano, some hair, and Paderewski (if you
don’t pronounce him Paderefski, his manager,
John Lemmone, won’t let you in to reserve your
seats) will be in Sydney next month. Good thing
he comes in midwinter when the westerlies, re-
frigerated by snows on the Blue Mountains, are
sweeping over Sydney. None of our feminine
enthusiasts will generate enough enthusiasm to
rush the platform to kiss him, or to steal his locks
with scissors, as feminines are said to have done
in old and new world capitals. Concerning kiss-
ing, don’t you wish your visitors on your at-home
days during winter wouldn’t dab their cold noses
on your cheek ? A cold nose is a sign of health in
a dog, but not necessarily in a visitor.
A recent portrait of Pattie Browne shows her
magnificently-robed and posed (in her own flat)
against a three-fold screen lower than her head,
and on which she rests an outstretched arm.
Screen and trailing robe give her a stately
although quite fictitious appearance of height, and
she looks handsome and well-fed, but with no trace
of her old time Puck-like charm of expression.
Poor Pattie had a cold-tea and hard-crust time in
London prior to her becoming Mrs. Monteagle
Vere-de-Vere, or whatever her married name is.
The Fanshawes had a very lucid interval when
they decided to go to no more charity balls (they
did not so far attend any this winter), but to for-
ward the price of their tickets, and the lady’s
posy, and a subscription to the charity for which
the ball rolls. To the St. Vincent hop they sent
£5 and their best wishes.
Thirty of the most diamond-dusted matrons of
Sydney gave a ball last Tuesday, and as they had
£6OO to spend on it, you may imagine it hadn’t to
be very economically conducted. They subscribed
twenty pounds each. The two Governors, their
consorts, and staffs were present, and the show of
jewels would tempt a cracksman —amateur or
otherwise.
At “Raffles” on Monday night there was
a box-party from Federal Government House.
Lord Richard Nevill, Private Sec. Balmain
and the poetic-looking A.D.C. Stevens. They
watched the performance as if they were
actor-managers on the look-out for new talent.
But they didn’t applaud. Perhaps it’s not staff
etiquette, or maybe it reddens the hands. The
only time the trio showed emotion was when
Raffles told an unwelcome visitor to have a
brandy-and-soda, at the same time pointing to
the spirit-stand. At that they leant —the Balmain
man especially— out over their box thirstily to see
if there really was anything drinkable on the
premises.
Up the street, at “The Marriage of Kitty,”
the State Governor’s people were present, in-
cluding three girls—Miss Rawson and Mr.
Robertson Clark’s two sisters. Lady Rawson
kept under her furs, but the girls showed no
signs of goose-flesh. The escorts Share, Wilson
and Clark, made a much more ornamental group
than the vice-regal deer boxed at Her Majesty’s.
Our friend, Edward VII., has accepted a copy of
Laura Palmer-Archer’s book of Queensland stories.
Mr. Horace Tozer mentioned the book to Edward,
who promised to read it —to actually read it.
Nora Long, the Maoriland soprano, sends good
accounts of herself from London. On the way
to England she was presented with a purse
of sovereigns by the women passengers. She
is working under Guy d’ Hardelot, who pro-
mises to make her “one of the world’s
singers,” and is training her with a view
to grand opera. Miss Mylott and Miss
Long are sharing a flat. Previous to the departure
of these two birds they made a most successful
tour of this State. Eva is credited with the
hardest of business heads. A postcard from
Sylvia Blackston showed her to be just leaving
Naples after “a delightful time.”
The Montefiore House ball was one of the best-
dressed dances up to date. A gown of black
chiffon, with an underdress of white glace silk,
profusely decorated as to skirt and sleeves with
big hydrangeas of ribbon work, was a notable one.
Such a flock of debutantes, mostly named Cohen
or Levy, were presented to the Rawsons, who
smilingly shook each Miriam’s plump hand.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
. “ The first Town Hall hop this winter was as an
aid to the funds of the Homoeopathic Hospital, but
it had no conspicuous success. Even the promise
that the Waxcellency Dame would shake the right
paw of every recruit to the ranks of excessive girl
failed to draw anything considerable. The only
gorgeous dress on show was a milky crcpe-de-chine,
festooned with a fine old lace and unblinking
scarlet poppies, over the diamonded tier. This
was worn by the Mayoress.
“Pastor Fitchett’s twin papers, Life and New
Idea, break out startlingly in spots. The illus-
trated article instructing the good Methodist girl
‘ with the thin hair ’ how to buy a switch and
adjust it so as to avoid detection is calculated to
make old John Wesley turn in his grave; while
the apparition of the noble-minded but corpulent
Edward VII., arrayed mostly in a light tie and
boots, is to an ardent loyalist almost shocking.
All women’s magazines now have long articles on
‘aids to beauty.’ Yet old people tell me wearily
that, after all, girls don’t seem any better-looking
than they did 20 years ago, when such services
would have overwhelmed them with grave sus-
picion.
“Mrs. Braddon and her daughter of the peach-
blossom complexion set off for the Big Smoke
soon. The Sargoods, mother and daughter, are
still voyaging round prior to settling down some-
where in the Cold Country. This pair do their
globe trot without fuss or enthusiasm. However,
Miss Sargood will be breaking out of black shortly,
the 18 months of bereavement being up.
“It was on behalf of Mrs. Robert Reid more
than on account of a certain Customs prosecution
that the late Mr. Reid and his family took their
recent trip to England. Every mail afterwards
brought out news of the stout matron’s improved
bill of health, and the clan out at Balwyn were
full of thanksgiving when that cable of Robert
Reid’s end brought an unexpected shock.
“The engagement that sprang its surprise on
Melbourne m Cup week, and made one particular
couple the most observed of all Terrace pro-
menaders at Flemington, is now off. A tired feel-
ing appears to have supervened. The disparity of
years was cheerfully winked at from the very start,
and when once a little obstacle like that is good-
humoredly overlooked, it seldom crops up again.
The age-question being disposed of, the engage-
ment proceeded smoothly for a time. Then it
slowed down and, one day, it just stopped short,
never to go again.
‘ ‘ A Melb. motorist has forbidden his skittish
young wife to spin into rustic parts and hazy dis-
tances with the motorman, who happens to be
good-looking, humorous, and ‘superior.’ His
master is none of these things. Hence the friction.
There is a parallel case in Melbourne’s medical
circles. In this instance, a miserable-looking
doctor denies James and the hooded buggy to his
frisky spouse. Hansoms may be whistled up
whenever needed, and whistled regardless of cost,
but the magnificent J ames is kept by his master’s
side, and guarded like a Hutton cablegram secret.
“ The saddest thing about ‘ The Representative
Homes and their Occupiers,’ which Paunch has
been exposing for months, is the utter unworthi-
ness of the podgy lord and the homely lady who
pose among the bronzes of the handsome hall or
under the shadow of an undraped French goddess
in an expensive corner of the drawing-room. The
visit of the interviewer seems to be generally timed
for the morning, and the missus comes in from the
garden with her scutty skirt and pre-prandial
business air on, and squats down under Ariadne
or Psyche, or a winged Hermes poised gracefully
on one bronze toe. And the boss of the house
wears tan boots and his most commercial aspect.
The views of Melbourne’s beautiful homes, accord-
ing to Paunch evidence, howl at you their cruel
incongruities.
“ They are still gushing this side over the extra-
ordinary success of the Kennel Club. One com-
mentator lets loose this threat: ‘lt may be con-
fidently expected that next year will see on the
benches many desirable specimens that would
hardly have got there had no effort been made to
organise the women enthusiasts throughout Vic-
toria.’ Why can’t they be organised for a grand
baby show ?
“ The steeple hat is in sight. The saucer brim,
and the inverted shovel shape, and the soup-plate
in chip, are to be replaced by designs as elevated
as the dialogues of Plato. This is the chance of
the squat to rise to a point of dignity, but it is sad
for the already high feminine, whose hat will
begin to look in at the bedroom windows of com-
plete strangers.
“Mrs. Bingham, since the death of her colonel-
husband, has been domiciled in Brussels, her
children being there at college. At latest Miss
L isly Madden had dropped her portmanteau at
the gorgeous capital, to put her company at the
disposal of the bereaved aunt.
“ Maud Hobson speaks of the Gaiety devil as a
sinful memory of old times. Very refined and!
finely-finished girls take to the boards now, says:
this surprising Lady St. Malory, and the bur-
lesque girl in tights goes right out of the show..
The younger generation of men view the old!
Gaiety methods with disapproval, and agree that
if that is the class of thing which amused their
immediate elders, these elders must have beent
‘common.’ And then the handsome mummer
tells of her domestic virtues, the virtues of the
whole profession, and fits a bright, shining halo om
every head within the aim of recollection. I won-
der was Maud putting a strain on that inter-
viewer’s limb, or is it a serious fact that the:
Gaiety devil is dead, quite dead? I hope noti
There’s been such an alarming mortality among
devils lately. Even the church devil is now dead.
“ Miss Olive Noble leaves Australia in a week ct»
two. This likeable actress was superseded in one
of her parts by a girl from the ranks, and now
Miss Unie Russell is to take her place in the co.
The management has tried the young Melbourne-
novice in a variety of characters, and found her
good in all of them. So she gets a quick succes-
sion of chances when the co. starts a tour.
“Rather rich to find the ‘Three Little Maids,!
all the way from London, taking lessons in the'
simple pirouette from Miss Brenan ! Said maids-
felt their needs in this direction badly when they
put themselves out for toe-practice.
“A son of the late Edmund Keogh married in
Tasmania the other day Miss Evelyn Rigney, the
clever, graceful daughter of a wealthy squatter in
the Avoca district. Mr. Bryan Keogh is rather
well known in Melbourne as the youngest of a
professional batch of brothers. Old Edmuud
Keogh was the auctioneer who surprised everyone
by leaving a rather tangled will and just enough
money to allow a second wife and his children
to litigate some in the courts. Everyone had
supposed the luxurious old gentleman to have
been moneyed. He wasn’t, and his widow has
become an industrious bread-winner.
“The Melb. woman is becoming an associa-
tion maniac. Societies for the Destruction of
the Moth, and the Advancement of The Exalted
Moment, and the Spread of the Athanasian Creed
with its warm Damnatory clauses in the Antarctic,
are springing up all over the place. You generally
see one female dominating each fresh society and
you know her by the optimistic osprey shooting up
from her toque’s forequarters. The society
exploiter is addicted to the osprey. Last week
meetings in which most of the letters of the alpha-
bet were used up enlivened our cold snap. High v
Purpose pleaded in every instance and shone in,,
every eye. There were five men at one of these-
rallies (a temperance affair) and how the meeting
knew the number was through the entire five-
rushing to aid a young Miss who had fainted from,
too much Temperance.
“ Miss Alison Eairbairn and Miss Mars Buckley
are out with the Findon Harriers this season. .
Apathy seems to have settled over the other
showy horsewoman. The dasher has been quite •
out of the hunt for the past three seasons, and this
again starts without her. A daughter of Mr.
Frank Madden joined the ranks lately, but she’s .
not going to dash any.
“Preparations for St. Vincent’s hop on June’s j
second Wednesday are well advanced. The
Talbots and the M'Eacharns and others are due -
for a special opening set.
“ The marriage of Miss Kate Samuels to Pro-
fessor Mills —a Canadian don—is only a stepping-
stone to an American tour and a song career. It’s •
not going to be matrimony and pickle-preserving;
for the star of the Marshall Hall aviary, but a.
double-barrelled name—Madame Benda-Mills—
and a brisk platform campaign. This is wiser
and happier, and far more convenient than getting
along singly, with a small engagement now and)
then, and trial, disappointment, and almost
despair filling in the interval. Over and over
again word reaches here that in: London a musical)
aspirant must have an influential man friend! to
help steer her musical craft. And isn’t a husband
the most permanent form of that kind of friend ?

Benjamin Bryen, who died at Whitfield
(Vic.), the other day, was reputedly 103 years old.
He lived 23 years in Tasmania and 50 in Victoria.
Brisbane’s new Anglican Bishop, Dr.
Donaldson, is described as a Ritualist, and there
is likely to be a lively time in store through th 3
“Eastward position,” and lighted candles in day-
light and other needless holy frills.
“Peter A.”: When the banks began to
break, some years ago, a friend of mine said to
millionaire John Howard Angas : “I suppose,
with all your money, you must feel a little un-
easy just now?” “Money!” said Angas, in a
far-away voice, “ I’ve got no money.”
Thus the Waterside Workers’ Gazette :
A good thing may come out of the Sydney Daily Tele-
graph office —provided it comes out soon enough. H ugh
Mahon was for a time leader of its Parliamentary staff.
It is a somewhat peculiar coincidence that an ex-member
of the staff of the wealthy paper which cadged so long
for free postage should become Postmaster-General of the
Commonwealth, and should have been partially respon-
sible for making it toe the mark.
Ex-Labor member E. A. Roberts, who
went twice to fight in S’Africa, is the present
editor of the Labor Herald in Adelaide, and is
in the running for the editorship of the new daily
that is soon to be started there. Senator Guthrie
is one of the most energetic workers for the paper,
the shares in which are being taken up all over
the country and paid for in small weekly instal-
ments.
The father of Richard Bourlce, who died
lately at Limerick, Ireland, at the age of 93, was
the first Australian Governor who published
annually a statement of the public income and
expenditure. Preceding Governors did not feel
called upon to lay such matters before their “ sub-
jects.” He also ended the loose system of assign-
ing convicts, and staunchly befriended trial by
jury and freedom of the press.
“ Melb.” : Robert Reid being the richest
Baptist, Pastor Carey has, of course, delivered an
abjectly eulogistic sermon on this Softgoodser, de-
picting him as a Sir Galahad, with the limelight
on him. Kingston, who proved that the rich
Baptist’s firm was a mere thief, was inferential! y
held up as a wicked man who threw mud at the
godly. Another now forgotten Bob Reid in Vic-
torian politics was the one known as “ the China-
man’s friend.”
When Federal Minister Hughes entered
Parliament, and especially later on when he began
to study law, he was badly handicapped by deaf-
ness. Being advised that hard and persistent
exercise of the hearing apparatus would partially
remedy the defect, he bought a phonograph, loaded
it with speeches (other men’s), and used to put in
any odd moments, even while travelling, straining
to catch the words. There has been considerable
improvement, but there is still plenty of room.
REP. J. M. FOWLER, OF WESTRALIA.
“R.N.W.” writes :
Re “ Smiler ” Hales and his unpopularity. Heard from
officers of King’s Royal Rifles in S’Africa that “ Smiler ”
came to them after release by Boers in woebegone and
dilapidated plight. Mentioned that he was a war corres-
pondent and an Australian. They took him in, fed him, and
fitted him out, afterwards passing him on his way. It
was a poor return for such hospitality to get a lot of abuse,
those very hosts, in the Daily News. According to
“R.B.’s” par. (Bulls-iv, 5/5/’ol\ the festive Hales
behaves like a boor, and is scarcely a recommendation to
Australian journalism.
“ J.E.W.”: Re John Haynes and his in-
surrection. It is a characteristic of the great
Haynes brotherhood to insurrect and get violently
excited for a time. “Dicky” and “Doctor,” the
Westralian members of the clan, break out regu-
larly in a fierce revolution, and just as regularly
subside. Just now, Dicky is standing for North
Perth, and is socking it into the Government, the
Labor party, State Socialism, and several other
things, while the Doctor is wiping the floor with
the Perth daily papers for refusing to publish
Hansard reports of the proceedings of the
Council, of which he is a member. The most
hilarious court incident in Westralia’s history
occurred a few years ago, when Dicky, who is a
K.C., cross-examined the Doctor, and both insur-
reeted. It was a truly memorable occasion.
An old Sydney native died recently in the
person of Mrs. Hannah Byrne, at the age of 87
years. Her husband still lives, aged 96. Mrs.
Byrne was the daughter of Andrew Byrne, and
was born in O’Connell-street, Sydney, where her
father owned land. He afterwards kept the
Peacock Inn, later known as the Woolpack,
at the corner of George and Campbell streets, a
quaint old house built below the street. Patrons
fell down into the bar, and climbed up out of it
on all-fours, and the lodger who wanted to reach
his bedroom could step on to the balcony from the
street without going through the house. The old
Sydney pub. was a quaint, picturesque place —
quite unlike the modern affairs, all built on one
dull pattern, with a plate-glass window, a poker
machine, and a barmaid with a gallon of false hair.
A CURRENT PLAY— “ THE MARRIAGE OF KITTY."
During a recent speech, in reply to a
deputation wanting money, the Vic. Premier
said “ You cannot squeeze Bent.” Writer recol-
lects on one occasion when he of the bandy legs
and pronounced girth was in the private bar of a
well-known hostelry, not 50 yards from Bourke-
street, when closing hour arrived, and when Bent
stuck in the narrow back-door it took the united
pressure of three barmaids to push him through
into the street. Which proves that a deputation
of sufficient barmaids can squeeze Bent, anyhow.
Ebenezer Ward, of Adelaide, writing to
the papers about his recent arrest for drunkenness,
complained of the inhuman conduct of the police,
who “thrust him into a cell and left him there,
bleeding and ill, for six hours of the night without
covering or bed.” The following day the Police
Commissioner took up the cudgels on behalf of the
force, and published their report on the subject,
which stated that, “not only was Ward given the
ordinary prison bed and covering, but on account
of his age, and the fact that he was a J.P., three
extra blankets.” Now we know the advantage of
being a J.P. —three extra blankets when run in.
An ancient Hebrew lady passed over in
Woolloomooloo, last week, at the age of 80 years.
Mrs. Julia Moses was the daughter of Abraham
Moses and the wife pf Elias Moses, who were m
partnership at 3 Bridge-street as general mer-
chants up to the late fifties. The deceased lady
came to Sydney with her father in 1834. She has
left a family of seven daughters, one son, 47 grand-
children, and 32 great-grand-children. When
Mr. Abraham Moses arrived in Sydney the Syna-
gogue was in Bridge-street, right opposite the
premises afterwards occupied by him. T hat syna*
gogue still stands, but deals in rum, not religion,
are transacted therein.
Bewick, Moreing and Co., probably for a
few months past the most-talked-of firm in Aus-
tralia, consists of three partners—C. Algernon
Moreing, H. C. Hoover, and T. Wi Wellsted.
Moreing, the head of the firm, was born in N.S.
Wales, and got his early mining experience there.
Hoover, however, is the best known mining man.
In its present form the firm is only 15 months old ;
neither Hoover nor Wellsted belonged to the
original Bewick, Moreing and Co. Ihe firm,
which now controls more than half the gold out-
put of Westralia, has two chief representatives
there—W. Pritchard, who holds its power of
attorney, and W. J. Loring, its engineering
adviser.
A. D. Handyside, who died suddenly at
Narracoorte lately, was a well-known Adelaide
identity and station man. He had been in Parlia-
ment since ’B5, and once, in Holder’s first stop-gap
Ministry, was Commissioner of Works. In the
House he was Speaker Coles’ crony; the two were
much alike, and were often mistaken for one
another. Handyside was never much of a talker,
and averaged, until lately, hardly more than one
speech a session; but he had a way with him m
the smoking-room that counted for a lot. It is
quite likely that there would have been a com-
bination of Conservatives and Laborites long
since to turn Jenkins out if it hadn t been for
“Handy.”
R. S. Anderson and Co., solicitors of Mel-
bourne (Vic.), have failed, the estimated liabilities
being £68,000. Assets £7OOO. The firm was
founded in 1854 by Robert Stirling Anderson,
whose son is the insolvent. The founder was a
Dublin solicitor, admitted in the year 1848, who
emigrated to Melbourne in ’54. He resided at the
then Emerald Hill, where he became a person of
much importance, his rival being James Service,
who also lived on the Hill. Anderson was member
for the Hill as far back as 1855. In 1860 he
was Commissioner for Customs in the Heales
(“ People’s ”) Ministry. He held the same post
under John O’Shannasy, and subsequently held
office under Francis Kerferd, M'Culloch and Ser-
vice. In the Service Ministry of 1883 he was
Minister for Justice. On retiring from the
Assembly and gaining a seat in the Council Ander-
son became a high Tory. He died in harness as
Minister for Justice in 1883.
One of the things to the credit of the
Watson Ministry is that two of its members,
Hughes and Batchelor, once stopped Peacock
from laughing on the Federal Parliamentary
premises. They were having dinner when
Peacock came in, sat down, and let olf his fear-
some bray. A plate dropped from Hughes’
trembling hand and broke on the floor. Peacock
brayed again, and Batchelor gave a wild start and
shed his cup and saucer on the floor. Peacock let
off bray 111., and the leap Hughes gave wrecked
the sugar basin. “ What the devil is the matter
with you fellows ? ” said Peacock’s companion.
“ It’s that fellow’s laugh,” said Hughes in an
agonised tone. “It makes us jump so that we
upset everything. If he laughs again we’ll upset
the room. ” Then an enraged Peacock disappeared
in the distance, and it was many days before he
re-visited the premises. A man of ready wit
would have stayed on and laughed till Hughes
and Batchelor had dissipated Turner’s surplus in
breakages, but Peacock’s vacant, rambling howl
doesn’t signify a sense of humor.
“Tot ” reminisces :
A “ Poverty Point ” par. (B. 5/5/’O4) mentions Vincent
Pyke playing a small part in the Victorian legislators’ per-
formance of “ Merchant of Venice ” at old Theatre Royal,
Melbourne, in ’6o—also writing and speaking the epilogue.
Pyke had a curious public career. He began life as a draper
on Fryer’s Greek, where his canvas sign was visible till the
middle seventies. Having made a mark in the local
debating club, he Was returned to the Legislative Assembly
for Castlemaine in ’56. He resigned to accept a billet as
immigration lecturer in England. On his return the
O’Shanassy Government appointed him goldfields warden
at Bendigo. Being bitten with a desire for Ministerial
office, he threw up his billet in ’6O and successfully con-
tested Castlemaine against R. D. Ireland, O’Shanassy’s
Attorney-General. A portfolio in the Nicholson Ministry
fell to Pyke shortly afterwards. When that Administra-
tion was defeated a few months later, Pyke was stranded,
there being no payment of members in those days. He
resigned his seat in Parliament, went to Maoriland, was
made a goldfields warden by Julius Vogel, wrote a novel
of M.L. life, had a long experience of the local Parliament,
and died about 10 years ago. A curious instance of the
craze for public life spoiling a man’s material interests.
A Bulletin man also thinks he remembers Pyke
in Maoriland. He was passing along the street
when there flew out horizontally at him a broken
window, a large dish, a leg of mutton, some roast
potatoes and a quantity of gravy. Also he heard
somebody inside using violent language about the
cooking. He was afterwards informed that it was
Pyke’s house, but there may have been some
mistake.
About a partially-forgotten German :
Sichel, the new biographer of Disraeli, is said to be an
Australian native, born in Melbourne during his father’s
management of the sugar refining works erected at Sand
ridge by his brothers-in-law, the Joshuas. Sichel, senior,
was born in Manchester of German parents and educated
in the Vaterland. He married a daughter of one of the
Joshuas, and they migrated to Victoria, where they made
fortunes as storekeepers on the Mount Alexander diggings.
Sichel became a partner of the Joshuas, and in the sixties
he was a first ranker amongst Melbourne merchants. He
was a typical fatman and “highly respected,” although
he caused amusement amongst his own crowd by mixing
up Greek and Latin quotations with the prices in his
weekly Commercial Circular. Early in the seventies he
tried conclusions with Edward Langton for West Mel-
bourne Assembly seat. It was a most exciting and
picturesque election, and money was no object. Sichel,
thoffgh defeated, manfully paid up £7OOO for expenses to
his committee. The merry Josh Pickersgill and a coterie
of Bohemians concocted a decorative scheme for Collins-
street to glorify the candidate. One of the items was a
huge banner spanning the whole width of the street.
During the night before the election workmen stealthily
fastened the banner on a stout wire rope, one end of
which was secured to Sim Cohen’s office, on the third
floor of Gemmelliand Tuckett’s old auction rooms. The
other end of the rope was fastened to the roof of the old
Exchange. There was a tremendous sensation in the
morning, and the Mayor ordered corporation workmen to
remove the decoration. Then a fight ensued in Sim
Cohen’s office between Sichel’s barraekers and the corpor-
ation workmen who brought along the fire-escape ladder
and scaled the wall. Josh stood at the window with an
axe and threatened bloodshed, but Town Clerk Fitzgibbon
either led the attack or urged it on from the rear, and the
“ obstruction ”in the air was removed. It brought down
with it some bricks from toe old Exchange. One of them
fell on a cent, per cent. Conservative who couldn’t be
pacified under £2CO. Sichel left Melbourne about 25 years
ago. His son, the new biographer of Disraeli, although a
native of Victoria, received most of his education in
Europe.
Now that Adye Douglas has passed from
the plane of practical politics, affection for the old
battler is re-asserting itself, and Tasmanians are
recalling his alleged bons mots. Adye is pretty
well past the age of repartee and original
humor, but one recent anecdote of him will stand
print. He had been dining with Governor
Havelock, and having dined, the men smoked.
Conversation turned to the population problem.
“By the way, ’ said Havelock to the veteran, we
haven’t had the pleasure of—ah—seeing your name
in the papah lately.” “ No,” said Adye ; the
fact is, speaking in confidence, that Mrs. Douglas
is not so young as she was.” Which is true, but it
the lady was much younger she would be young
enough to pass for her husb-ind’s granddaughter,
“ Spring ” writes from the gallery of
N.S.W. State Assembly :
The N.S.W. Strangers’ Gallery will be a bit sorry if
Deformer Wood gets a woodener down Bega way. lie
appears to think it his duty to talk drearily on everything
t lat is brought up. He was dragged from obscurity and
g.ven a portfolio in the Lyne-See Ministry. When Long
Kill left to drift around in Federal politics, See recon-
structed and left Wood out in th: cold with a swelled head
and a heart full of grief. The “Strangers” call him
Tattle-Tit Wood because of his girlish habit of continually
telling what happened at former Cabinet meetings.
Wood’s neck and head remind the gallery of a turtle’s.
He fairly fascinates See. When Wood is on his legs See
saunters in pretending complete unconcern, sits down,
and with his hands firmly gripping the seat on each side
of him and with head bent forward glares in contemptuous
silence at the human drought from Bega. Gradually the
latter works round to the old Cabinet days and starts to
make long turtle necks at John. Under the tittle-tattle
the latter is restless and heated, but when the turtle necks
commence he usually explodes into a volcano of bluster
and wrath. See is funny in a rage, and therefore the
gallery will be sorry if Wood gets outed, although the
country ought to feel glad.
HISTORY MIGHT REPEAT ITSELF.
FIRST CIVIL SERVANT: “ Just fancy, Cholly, all
this row in Parliament about bringing us
under arbitwation as if we'd ever stwike.”
SECOND C.S: “ You don’t know, Algy. A worm
has been known to turn."
A Melbourne man writes :
Robert Reid, the proud, pompous wholesale draper,
rose from nothing to control a gigantic business. He was
a shrewd Scotchman who could talk. He was very daring
and a break-neck speculator. His credit with British and
American manufacturers was colossal and practically un-
limited until the Melbourne land-boom burst. One way
the Australian wholesale drapers coined money was by
long credit. The period was often two years, and after
that bills could be renewed in London at 4 per cent. In
Australia the wholesale man gave the ordinary three
months’ credit and charged 10 per cent, for renewals. If
a wholesale house turned over, say, £500,000 a year there
was not only the trade profit but also the difference in
the rate of interest between 4 and 10 per cent, on perhaps
£300,000. Reid was, however, ambitious to make millions
and speculated largely in real estate. One day, in 1889,
Felstead, the Australian agent for Bradstreet’s Commer-
cial Inquiry Office, presented himself at the Flinders-
street magnate’s office and politely asked Reid to allow
an investigation into his financial position. “ The devil
you do,” said Reid breathlessly. “If jmu don’t clear out
of this office in double-quick time I’ll kick you down-
stairs.” “ Very well,” said the imperturbable commercial
detective ; “ I am acting on instructions from our London
office and I have a duty to perform. We are acting on
behalf of clients.” Reid, however, only became all the
more enraged, and Felstead was shown the door. He
sent his report to London. From that day Robert Reid
had much to explain personally which necessitated many
visits to England, and although he struggled through the
crisis, and demonstrated his financial strength by buying
out Buckley and Nunn for £320,000, his credit in England
suffered a temporary eclipse. He nevertheless pulled
himself together, and the big win against the New South
Wales Government over resumed wharf properties placed
him once more in a strong financial position. After dis-
covering the results of his discourtesy to the commercial
detective, he acted on Machiavelli’s principle—“ If you
cannot kill your enemy embrace him.” He not only made
a friend of Felstead, but became generally the most
accessible and affable of business men in Melbourne.
Since his adventure with the Customs under the Kingston
regime Reid had lost all his gaiety and bounce. The
Brisbane prosecution, it is generally believed, accelerated
his death.
INFLUENZA’S HERE I
Influenza is in the air ! Beware—it's catching! First a cold, then a fever—boring pains in head and
e y eg aching pains in limbs and back—sickness and weakness—loss of appetite—disordered stomach—That’s
Influenza. It taints the blood, pulls down the health, saps the energy, unnerves the nerves.
Still Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People never fail to ward off and cure the dread effects of
Influenza. Why 1 Because they actually make new blood. They drive all poison out—fill parched-up veins
with warm, clear, healthy blood. Dr. W illiams’ Pink Pills have cured more cases of Influenza and its
dread effects than all other medicines put together. Read this :
“ Influenza knocked me right out of football,” says Mr. George Keenan, a well-known footballer, living at the Golden
Fleece Hotel, Bussell-street, Melbourne. “It began with dull, heavy pains in the head, and then my shoulders, arms and legs
eut so sore that I was afraid to move. I felt as if I had been lying on broken glass. Shivering fits seized me and I could barely
keen my eyes open. At times my face was as hot as fire. When I coughed I thought my head would split. I could not sleep,
and the best meal did not tempt my appetite. My nerves went to pieces—the least noise upset me. I drank bottles of doctor’s
nhvsic and patent medicines without getting any real good. At last a chum told me how Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale
People cured Influenza by actuallv making new blood and driving out of the system all the germs and dregs of disease. I got
some and the first box did me a heap of good. My blood seemed to get warmer, and I could feel the pains and the soreness
going from my limbs and body. I began to sleep soundly and to eat heartily. Three boxes of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale
People made a new man of me.”

OLD LADY: “Excuse me, young man; don’t you feel well!”
BROWN ( very seasick): “ I do, madam, I do. I merely make a habit of looking like this to
please the ladies. They think Pm composing poetry."
Scrip : Bulletin (12/5/’4) throws the
cold eye of suspicion on a par. about Tihape
(M.L.). The contributor wrote a very mild item
indeed. Tihape can give any place m the State
24§ miles and a bad beating in a run of 25 miles.
It takes all diplomas. The insurance companies
have now actually returned all premiums and
closed up business in the town, and such a hell
upon earth is it that one Anglican parson actually
refused to go there. He didn’t feel that God
called him, presumably. Men with big cheques
«ome in and take possession ; nobody stops
to see a fight—it is too common. Every fifth man
one sees has a damaged visage, or dingbats, or
sees things in the sky, and points with a
shaky finger to rainbows in trousers, comets hold-
ing wrestling matches, and the like. Special
sittings of the Court have perforce to be held on
Sundays; other Sunday attractions are football,
beer, and battles in side paddocks, the pugs being
stripped to the waist. There are lots of other
items which I leave to the imagination. Struck
there not long ago, and when I got an opportunity
to get out I never looked back, having in my mind
a vague recollection of Sodom and Gomorrah and
Mrs. Lot. Further along I struck a place known
as God Help Us, which is being rushed by specu-
lators and may prove another Tihape in the near
henceforth.

Harry Stockdale writes :
With every deference to the experience of Mr. A. P.
Cameron (B. 7/4/’O4) I must still maintain that the
marriage of first cousins is not permitted amongst our
aborigines. Even marriage between second cousins was
at one time forbidden. Mr. Cameron again would put
the marriage age at 13 to 14 years ; but I have found that
girls are frequently betrothed when only a few years old,
and I have known many cases in which they have been
handed over to their promised husbands (usually oldish
men), and have become mothers, before they were 13.
The inquiry into the intricate aboriginal marital relation-
ships is rendered very difficult by the number of wives
possessed by most aboriginal men and by the strict rule
of never mentioning the name of a deceased person.
This difficulty of obtaining correct information from the
blacks is responsible doubtless for the many errors
re the natives that creep into even works of high
repute. Thus in Spencer and Gillen’s “ Native
Tribes of Central Australia ” it is stated that it
“ takes an exceptionally good man to kill or disable
with a spear at more than 20 yards.” Now, I was
wounded in the hip once by a stone-headed spear thrown
at over 80 yards. Further, I can myself throw a spear
140 yards, and have seen five black boys throwing
together in Sydney, each of whom threw over 40 yards
further than I did. Any one of these could have driven a
spear clean through a man or kangaroo at up to 60 or 70
yards. If such errors can occur with regard to what we
see with our own eyes, such as the throwing of a spear,
how much easier is it to make blunders about what has to
be orally communicated, especially as the aboriginal ia
prone to answer questions about his inner life in the way
that he imagines will best please the questioner ?

“Scrip”: Re “Mailer’s” statement that
hungry sharks draw no rigid “color line,” and
“ Ne’er-do-Weeks” observations thereon in a sub-
sequent issue (8., 5/11/’O3), the natives of Aitutaki
go much further than diving for coins in shark-
infested waters —they clear the coral patches of
the fish by making lines fast to his tail and hauling
him into boats. The sharks there, though, do not
appear to be large, and live in caves. Sceptical
Maorilanders were recently treated to a circum-
stantial account of one of these little fishing
expeditions by the Aitutaki correspondent of the
N.Z. Herald. The party included the Resident
Agents of Mangaia and Aitutaki. Two native
divers located a shark in one of the coral patches,
and after considerable manoeuvring got two hitches
of line round its tail. They then got clear, and
the shark was hauled alongside the boat, but
before they could hoist it in the line parted and it
got away. Going to the next cave a little further
on, they found it there with two other sharks, and
two of the three were secured without much
trouble. The sharks snap viciously at everything
within reach when being hauled aboard, but never
touch the niggers who are taking liberties with
their end pieces. It is even claimed that the
dusky divers have a knack of soothing them, and
are able to turn them round when the wrong
end of the fish is presented to them. It’s a queer
way of making a living, anyhow.

“Chasselas”: “A.P.R.” (B. 11/2/’O4) is
wrong in saying the kurrajong is the only native
tree on which cattle and sheep will thrive and
fatten. The she-oak has tided many stock-owners
over bad spells of drought, and I have seen as
many as eight men employed lopping she-oak
branches for stock on some of the big runs in
Victoria.
From “ Curlew” :
As an argumen t for closer
settlement, the case of the
auriferous lands north and
east of Bendigo (Vic.) is illus-
trative. These leases are let
in 20-acre blocks on license,
revocable by the Government
at any time ; they are open
to any digger who may choose
to step in and work under
miner’s right or lease, and
they are dog-poor. Yet since
the country is settled, and
there is thus a chance to get
within reasonable distance of
a market, every available 20
is in issue between 17 or 18
applicants, and lawyers
gather like cormorants round
the tables at every Land Board
to do battle for their clients.
‘ ‘ Spreading lying re-
ports ” is a petty sessions

average there are a dozen

offence ; so, by the way,
is adultery. The last, in
fact, is about the com-
monest charge on the

of “ drunk and disorder-
ly ” in the average Aus-
tralian court. And, as
one officer in charge said in his last report, it is
the lady who plays the part of Eve over again.
“There is no female prison in this division,” he
laments, “ and the women have not been slow to

Thus a modest Coolgardie father to Syd-

“0.0.”: If “Rita S.”
\B., 19/5/’O4) had fully under-
stood my remarks upon the
up-to-date drover who drives
behind his flocks in a sulky,
he (or is it she ?) would have
noticed that I did not com-
pare him with the hard-
drinking cow-Ishmael un-
favorably as regards that
accomplishment. Quite the
reverse. I drew attention to
his advantages in being able
to camp at a pub every even-
ing instead of watching his
charges all night in the open.
As for the old-timer “tickling
Betsy Jane under the gills in
the bad old dawdling days,”
if “Rita S.” had stock on
the road, he or she wouldn’t
mind how long the tickling
lasted so long as the sheep or
cattle were filling themselves
on the grass of Betsy Jane’s
old man. That sort of thing
is part of the game, and the
good drover always seizes any
chance to “dawdle” when on
good feed. Says Rita S.—
“To-day time is the essence
of the contract.” Nonsense!
Tho E. of the C. is to deliver
the stock full tally, and in
good condition. The “scorn
' of auctioneers and stock-
dealers for drovers who dally
by the way,” will raise a smile on
the faces of many of your readers
who have listened impatiently to
the excuses of the contract drover who
delivers his mob a week or two before
it was expected—“ Couldn’t steady
’em when the grass wasn’t too good;
and never got a chance to loaf when we
got on to good feed is the tale of the
nian who drops his stragglers by the way-
side and delivers the balance as poor as
wood. Yet, “the successful drover must
be a hustler.” Not much, “Rita.” He’s
rarely successful in getting a second job from
the same employer. The whole science of
droving. is loafing—on somebody else’s grass.
If my sheep or cattle are doing well on the
roads, why should I yearn for them to be at work
on my own paddocks ? Drover Harrison, who on a
good trip only averages (H miles per day, couldn’t
be called a successful hustler; yet, when he de-
livered his 14,000 wethers, to a sheep, at Killarney,
I doubt if Mr. Buchanan eyed him scornfully and
“roused” on him for not hustling. No “Rita,”
there is more in the old-time drover’s “dallying”
than meets the eye.
THE OLD ’PLAINT.
PLAIN BUSINESS APE: “ They say here that the new performing
monkey at the circus is a great success.”
POETIC APE (tearfully): “Everybody expects us to stand on our
heads for the amusement of the vulgar herd. All our efforts
to raise the mental level of our species are futile.”
The land of bones : Quambone, Girilam-
bone, Gelumgambone, Gulargambone, Mumble-
bone, Bugilbone, Wallamgambone, Buttabone,
Tharambone, Merryanbone, Nangerybone, Geral-
gambone, Mungerbumbone, Quantambone, Galara-
gambone, Billybingbone, Willybingbone, Merry-
bone, Cullenbone, Terembone, Marebone and
Jawbone are all in New South Wales, and mostly
in the Nyngan-Narrabri district. Strangely
enough, there is hardly another bone in the rest
of Australia, except “ trombone,” which is the
Crow-eater’s name for a vegetable marrow.
TBUCKING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’m a trucker at a sawmill, and I get a bob a truck—
A rather small and miserable dole ;
But it’s better than a-tramping on my uppers, out of luck,
And it isn’t to be sneezed at, on the whole.
The blocker curses wildly when I let a block roll back—
It’s true he gets some rather solid knocks ;
And the njiller swears and threatens that I’ll get the
“ blooming saok,”
If I don’t improve my methods trucking blocks.
The boss is mostly growling at the way the blocks are
stacked,
And his dreadful swears I never could repeat:
‘ ‘ How often have I showed you how the firewood should
be packed,
And how to keep the bloomin’ rows all neat;
For the dealers are exacting now, and prone to pick and
choose—
They’ve now on hand some heavy forward stocks—
And I’ve got to please ’em somehow, or their custom I
will lose,
And there isn’t much a-doing now in blocks.”
I’ve got to stoke the engine and at times it startles me,
The “ governors ” don’t steady her a bit,
And the fly-wheel goes a-spinning every time the bench
is free,
And the bencher only grins and curses it.
And the key that holds the fly-wheel on the crank is sel-
dom tight,
So I tremble while the crazy engine rocks.
But the bencher jams the billets ’gainst the saw with all
his might,
And steadies down the engine sawing blocks.
The inspector comes round yearly ; just now he’s nearly
due,
But our boiler isn't tested every year,
For they hide it and they borrow one that’s pretty sure
to “ do ”
From a sawmill in the ranges back of here.
Yes, the billet’s rather risky, but there’s nothing else at
hand,
And now I’m getting used to scars and shocks,
And the graft is not too heavy if the wages aren’t grand,
And there’s plenty of excitement trucking blocks.

HE KISSED ME TWICE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A blush was spread o’er the western sky,
And loud was the mirth in the mopoke’s note—
’Twas a freak of Fate that, that evening, I
Wore a crimson rosebud beside my throat ;
And Joe, as we talked by the milkers’ gate,
Fondled my flower, and he said ’twas nice,
Then the laggard bold, whom I dearly hate,
Slyly tilted my chin—and kissed me tivice !
Dimmed were the stars through the gum trees blinking,
When Joe asked me, gravely, if I would “ splice ” ;
I babbled “ Yes ! ” without even thinking,
But that was after he’d kissed me twice !

I3HUNTER STREET,SYDNEY.&ATBRISBAIIEJLONDON


A fearsome and frequent type out back is
the bush politician, who occupies half the fire at
the wayside pub. on wintry nights. He is usually
a fat, red-faced man. If, to change the subject,
You surmise that to-morrow will be a fine day, 'he
shouts : “ How can yer expect the Almighty will
send yer fine weather while O’Sullivan is alive ? ”
His strong lungs enable him to shriek down
opposition, and the landlord won’t throw him out-
s', le, because he usually owes the politician money,
or the politician owes him money, which in effect
amounts to the same tiling.
A DOUBTFUL HONOR.
SPOKESMAN: “ Day, Mick. We come as a deppy-
tation from the electors of Dingbat, askin’
for you to be the Mayor this time."
PUBLICAN: “Well, seein’ that the electors of
Dingbat is bound to mistake this here shop
for the Mayoral cupboard I begs to decline.
The slate’s full enough as it is.”
A yarn about Driver James Conroy, in the
days of Cobb and Co. :
Passing through Bargo Brush, Conroy’s coach was once
suddenly disabled by the bursting of a tyre on one of the
hind wheels. He at once pulled up and cut down two
strong saplings, one of which he strapped across the coach
behind the box seat, with one end sticking out on the side
of the broken wheel. On this rested the second sapling,
which was long enough to pass under the hack axle and
trail along the ground, thus doing in a very primitive way
the work of the damaged wheel. In this way two sap-
lings were worn out, but the third was cut fully 6ft.
longer than the others. The longer end was allowed to
stiolc out in front of the coach, and, as the back portion
wore away, the driver stopped and shoved the sapling
down from the front. Only three hours were lost by that
mishap. The news soon spread, and in the morning the
driver found the hotel yard crowded with townspeople
waiting to inspect the coach that had successfully carried
the mails on “ three wheels and a clothes-prop.”
“ E.” : JRe dog fighting (8.,
14/4/’O4). Once asw in an English city
a bulldog fasten on to the nose of a
dustman’s horse. All efforts to dis-
lodge him were unavailing, until an old
man produced his snuff-box and poured
the contents on the upturned counten-
ance of “ bully.” Bully let go to
sneeze and the position was saved.
[The Bulletin would not cast a doubt
on this story on any account, but, as a
rule, a dustman’s horse, when a bulldog
is hanging on to its nose, goes round
like a pretty considerable whirlwind,
taking the dog with it, and even a
young man who rushes after the dog’s
countenance with snuff has all his
work cut out. And this was an old
man. The story reads as if the old
man gave the snuff to a motionless
dog hanging on to a motionless horse.
—Ed. 8.l

“J.A.C.”: An English paper
states : “ The biggest edible oysters
in the world are found in Australia.
They measure sometimes more than a
foot across the shell.” I wonder where
they are to he found ; I should like
an occasional dozen. The biggest
oysters (Port Lincoln’s) I ever saw in
Australia, or anywhere else, I used to
get in Adelaide. They were not
“more than a foot across the shell,”
hut I have hid to cut one in four be-
fore tackling it. They were of ex-
cellent flavor, and I learn with regret
that they are becoming scarce. Thacke-
ray said after his first American
oyster that he felt as if he had
swallowed a baby. A Port Lincoln
reminded me of a young whale.

“Wer”: Amusing to follow a
goanna round the bole of a tree. I
have gone round a tree half-a-dozen
times without seeing a sign of him—
no limbs or leaves in the way ; then, doubling
back quickly, have got a glimpse of him, also
doubling back. As it was impossible for him to
see me as I went round and round the tree, having
the tree between us all the time, I presume he had
an eye on my shadow, or that he has a very keen
ear for locating sound.
~ Polstan : “Rita S.”, in a recent issue,
mentions the “harsh note of the wag-tail.”
Surely a mistake ! The wag-tail has a beautiful
and clear note.

“ Chasselas” : jRe Bulletin pars, asserting
that manna-sweating caused the death of gum-
trees. About 10 years ago I saw a tree dropping
manna like dew. The tree, a blue-gum, is still
alive, and though I have watched it carefully it
has never since given off any manna, nor does it
show signs of decay.
The mice invasion has struck the Castle
reagh. Rodent plagues are often followed by
droves of mangy, disreputable cats, for an
exclusive diet of mice doesn’t agree at all
with felines. Every log in the bush is in-
fested, and the farmers are stowing their flour,
sugar, &c., on mice-proof stands. Men camp-
ing out usually isolate the flour-bag by attach-
ing it to a wire, hung from tree to tree.

“ J.F.D.” : Peculiar markings and dis-
figurements run in some families. One I
knew of included an eldest boy with two
thumbs on each hand ; a second son with
webbed feet; and a third boy who had a
remarkable hairy tuft on his lower hack—
his schoolmates said it was a tail and called him
“the Devil.” Rumor said that a sister also
possessed something on some portion of her
anatomy, but I never saw that. The web-
footed phenomenon regularly charged half a
quince to any hoy who wanted to inspect his
extremities, but the brother with the tail
always used terrible language when his orna-
ment was alluded to. Once, when just about
to go in swimming, a debased incendiary set
fire to the tuft, and after that he was still less
inclined to discuss the subject.
“ Matchbox,” an old Bulletin contri-
butor, gives his version in a violent tone :
“H.5.R.”(8., 12/11/’O3) can find 50 cockies within ten
miles of present writer’s humpy who are paying boys £1
and 255. a week, and giving anything with whiskers £2
during the harvest. The cocky doesn’t deserve too much
consideration as an employer of labor, but the unem-
ployed seem to deserve less. Men are so scarce that prac-
tically any wage is demanded ; and they are getting so
infernally independent that they inquire about the
prospective employer’s religion, demand meals with the
family, and want to know if there are many “ encum-
brances” in the house. Was at Warracknabeal (Vic.)some
years ago. About 100 men were camped on the reserve,
wanting work, they said. Cockies came and begged them
to come for 9s. a day. Devil a shift! The majority of
them camped there most of the harvest time, robbing the
local hen-roosts and the industrious few who did return
with cheques. Know a cocky here who had six men
in the one week—all left of their own accord; sooner
tramp than work. It’s time bush hards damned the “vaga-
bond,” instead of casting a halo of romance over him and
his “blarsted dawg.” Nearly all the “poets” in Aus-
tralia are “ on the track.”
A SHOCKING ACCIDENT.
KYUEY: “Thunder ! What ails you, Egan?"
EGAN: “I filled my mouth with water to stop the tooth-
ache, and I’ve swcllered it!"

Four Eyes: Not up to the literary mark
P.W.K.: Lacks movement and vigor J.H.T.: Slight
and feeble Prank D. : Hardly well enough put to-
gether Gerald B. : Pill-yarn prosy; verse, very mode-
rate merit Arthur W.: Not bad in its way, but not
terse and pithy enough for Bulletin Hori-Hori:
“Situation” too awful for print Hugh V.: Neatly
versed, but conventional in sentiment... .Jack Nordlaw :
One has a good idea not well enough handled. The other
is too slight of interest....P.H.R.: Not enough in it....
Marco Polo : Has points, but is ill-constructed and cum-
brous Nelsie: Not good enough to print, but rather pro-
mising A.M. : Don’t enthuse very much over aboriginal
war-song Optimist: Not a very exciting statement of
the case.. .H.K.: No hope for your cock-a-doodle poem...
Cory : Accepted Carl A.: Unless you can acquire some
notions of composition you had better give up writing.
It is sorrowful waste of stamps Mars : Not much good.
And don’t ring in the lion quite so violently. It is
a beast with a very loud breath which drags its
head and tail in the dust most of the time
D.S.: A paraphrase of Longfellow’s “Psalm of Life.”
Mars : Verses rather lame P.O. : Remarks about
Caractacus somewhat belated. We closed our columns
against that estimable British gentleman in 1899 Tosh :
“Recluse” accepted I.R.E. : None good enough....
W.P. ; “Two and the Unionism” too ordinary. What-
ever you do, don’t be ordinary Open Eyes : You were
astonished, were you ? Poor beggar ! Will S. : There is
much humor in “Feud," but it is too rough Egg:
Heaven only knows where you got your pen-name, but
the yarn will be printed E.L.L.: Good lines in “ Song,”
but rose and bird subjects are hackneyed Eiram :
“Sinking” is an artificial melancholy P.M.: “Wait-
ing” not up to your usual standard Bill J.: Excellent.
C.E.D. : Verse that is about nothing in particular
isn’t in much demand Bob Z. : It is a good hymn, but
we don’t care for hymns. If you can write equally good
verse on some cheerful and frivolous subject you will be
acceptable E.W.D. : Thanks ; but the matter is hardly
of interest enough for the space.... .Cyril V. : Too many
weak points... .Lancewood : One too slight and the other
very crudely versified Van Be: Funny; but has not
skill enough in the “ setting.” L.A. : Situation
good; handling rather feeble... .Ray :No literary gift....
Stratford : Pretty well done, but we don’t print transla-
tions. ... J.S.G. : Too far-fetched... .Walter F.: No vita-
lity or force of narration... .Gill: No points about either.
.... Pauline E. : A crude piece of work C.W.J. : One’s
bad and t’other’s worse Sive : Versification good, but
subject isn’t a nice one on which to build a dainty rhyme.
W.B. : Ornamentally unintelligible... .Gadfly : You
haven’t got “sting” enough M.A.B. : No particular
merit... .Gert E. R.: You have poetic ideas, but, so far,
you lack verse-skill Amanda : Too elaborate in detail.
A mere hint to the imagination is often more effective
than the most careful verbal photography L.E.N. :
Lacks the breadth and simplicity required by the subject.
... .H. A.C. : Shaky syntax and rocky rhythm... .0.1i.M.:
Defer verse-writing until you can manage decent spelling
and grammar Drover: No time to wrestle with such
scribble Gomez : Your friend is right in asserting that
U.S.A. did not assent to the abolition of privateering-, but
doubtless any privateer would nowadays be treated as a
pirate... .H.R.M’D : Nothing distinguished about either.
G. H. Mac : No use for ponderous didactic essays
C.Mc-K.: No time for puzzles Mica : (1) Sensible sug-
gestions in the main, but they have been mostly made
before ; (2) impotency is a ground for divorce in all the
Australian States Patsie : Some promise M.E.C. :
Contributors’ names are never divulged without their
permission, unless in cases where they fraudulently
deceive a newspaper ; that’s the etiquette, and it is never
broken by a decent paper Fairdinkum: So far as
The Bulletin can see, the Victorian crowd was largely
responsible for keeping the N.S. Welshman Barton in the
Premiership for nearly three years, along with a Ministry
in which Victoria had less and N.S.W. more than its fail-
share of representation. Then it helped materially to
throw out its own countryman Deakin after he had been
seven months in office, and to put in the N.S. Welshman
Watson with a Ministry in which Victoria has only one
representative. And because it prefers the N.S. Welsh-
man Watson to the N.S. Welshman Reid, you are
making as much row as a menagerie about its
“hatred of N.S.W.” As for your other remarks, the
trouble with people like you is that you don’t judge the
Labor party by its own politics but by what the comic
liars of your own crowd say are its politics
Brown : No room for any more correspondents in that
line. Already fully represented in your district F.B. :
Will use “Dutehy’s Claim” as “ Aboriginality”....
F.W.O. : Haven’t read your yarn yet, but have paid the
fine for deficient postage Miss W.: Good item
Bacchante: Rather dreary P.S. (Tas.): Thanks; but
it is of no use to us Samivel: It isn’t “ absolute and
unmitigated rubbish” ; it’s just rubbish plain W.N.0.:
Too starchy and preachy Tina: Graceful conven-
tionalities in tremulous verse Joe H.: No; a tidal
wave means either the great general tide-movement
of the ocean, or such a high and rapid local tide as that el
the Bay of Pundy. “ Tidal ” is improperly applied to
earthquake waves.... Unsuitable : Ed. D., Lou, Wal.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTOR!.
P.S. : No. 6 under consideration ; No. 7 rejected
J.M.S. : Sorry, can’t “fix up” donkey joke Mac. :
Idea not fresh... .C.E.J. : Only a feeble outline Alan
M. : No finish, no background, no shading, not much per-
spective, no novelty, not much humor. Only a dem’d
outline G. Ryan : You have ideas, but not enough art.
W.H.V. : The worst joke that wo ever saw attached
to an equally bad picture I.M.C. : “Study in Blaek
and White ” not like any of the parties concerned....
Tindog : One or two may do, but they are rather a wild
lot Chou : But the keystone should be at the top of an
arch, and your arch looks like a nigger rainbow John
P. : Neither of the best quality. Also “ gun-canon ’’ joke
was better done by Mark Twain... .H.W.C. : Obstetneal-
cat joke declined Mcl. (M.L.): Candidly, it is no «s«
persevering. Your drawings are not very bad, but always
about half-a-yard below par, and you don’t improve
H 4 : Not caricatures; only bad drawings A.J.H. :
Nothing distinguished about picture, and our grandfather
used to use that funnyism Alan M. : Declined ; hare
met much worse samples though... .A.H. : Yes it’s worth
while persevering... .F.B. : The Jew fire joke is about
burned out E.G.E.: Dull gag and not a picture—only
an ink splodge Brush : Rates vary accord) ng to merit;
from 10 shillings to 10 guineas H.L. : Sketches tod
amateurish F.H.A. : Bulletin doesn’t profess to “ give
encouragement to beginners ” in the way of publishing
their sketches ; if it did much of that there would soom
be no Bulletin. You have a good deal of talent, but
unless you can get artistic training there isn’t muck
prospect Unsuitable : Wampye, Smoker, G. Hill.
N.S.W. acting-Premier Wise profe»ses to
be astonished that the valuable legislation he has
proposed in regard to child protection has not in
any way diminished the pietistic opposition to the
Cabinet of which he is a member. Obadiah and
Mrs. Obadiah continue to be ardent Deformers.
The same principle rules in regard to the tem-
perance people; they follow Joseph even when
the Joseph man is tied to the publican, and the
Labor man is an out-and-out cold waterite. Th©
various Social Purity, Good - Candidate, Tem-
perance, Protestant, and other such bodies in
N. are really but masks for the Foreign-
trade Calico-Jimmy party. They are not anxious
for social reform, but for Deform and Beidism.

THE PILLS
have gained their wonderful reputation by sheer force
of merit, because every person who uses them
recommends them to others. They have positively
no equal for thoroughly cleansing the system and
putting the liver and kidneys in functional order,
without pain or griping. They are the best known
rem-dy tor Indigestion, Biliousness, Headache,
Dizziness, and the common condition oi ill-health
known as “ run-down ” cr “out of sorts.” Females
of every age find Holloway’s Pills an invaluable
remedy and aid.
THE OINTMENT
is known throughout the world as positively tne
best and quickest remedy for Bad Legs, Old
Wounds and Sores, and Skin Eruptions of every
kind, and should be used in conjunction with the
Pills. It is also the speediest remedy for Rheu-
matism, Lumbago, Pains and Stiffness in the
Limbs and Joints, Backache, etc. For pains and
Soreness at the Chest, and for Throat and Lung
Complaints arising from Cold or Weakness,
Holloway’s Ointment affords most welcome relief
in a very short time.

POLITICAL
POINTS
One lady and 21 men attended the annual
meeting of the Freetrade Association in Mel-
bourne, and the chairman said that Freetrade was
rapidly spreading.
Vic. Premier Bent, the economist, pro-
mised nearly £400,000 worth of public works in
the last days of the electoral campaign. He was
a very excited man in those last days.
What has Premier Watson done to Sydney
Freeman’s Journal that it should libel him by
printing:—
The present Prime Minister represents N.S.W. as much
as Mr. Reid does—and quite as respectably.
Melbourne Argus suppressed Rep. Con-
roy’s attack on the Watson Government as
sympathising with the abolition of the marriage
tie—evidently thinking it too brutal for pub-
lication.
John Plummer writes the S.M. Herald,
complaining that during the speech recently
delivered by G. H. Reid he was interrupted no
less than 184 times. When Premier Watson was
making his first speech he was interrupted 153
times.
Apropos the awful row that has been raised
up north because an hotel-keeper has been ‘ ‘ called ”
to the Queensland Leg. Council, does anybody re-
member hearing any awful row when a brewer was
“called ?” Or even when a brewer Governor did
the calling ?
Significant that at the recent Croydon
(N.Q.) bye-election not one of the three candidates
had nerve enough to announce himself a follower
of the politically defunct Philp. The Laborite
won easily, followed by a Morganite and an “ in-
dependent ” Labor man, latter losing his deposit.
Said that at the last Federal elections a
Westralian Protestant candidate (now a member
of the House of Reps.) was waited upon by mem-
bers of the L.O.L. and informed that they had
unbounded confidence in him as a loyal Protestant,
but he was “keeping company” with a young
lady who was an R.C. He must drop her company
if he desired the support of the L.O.L. He
agreed. However, after his return, his attentions
were renewed with all the old energy.
PUFFING HIM UP.
“Mr. Bent is now a full-blown statesman.” —Admiring Melbourne weekly.
But the astonishing over-inflation of Bent only exaggerates his palpable defects, and, being
“full-blown,” further blowing will serve merely to hasten the inevitable explosion.
There is a daring wight in Tasmania, Dr.
A. A. Winch, who makes a grievance of the fact
that J.’sP. are chosen, not for their fitness to
administer the law, but as a reward for political
services, and petitions the local Parliament to
“remove the scandal.” It is almost too late for
reform now when J.P. has become a title of con-
tempt, not of honor.
Hobart Mercury, an organ of the Tory
class which arrogates to itself the good old name
of gentleman, published the statement that
“ trades-union leaders hold in their hands the uii-
dated resignations of Ministers.” As the state-
ment is a gross and malicious lie and slander,
Hobart Mercury would make a much better con-
vict than gentleman.
Adelaide Observer the other day printed
a furious article denouncing the White Australia
party for shutting out the cheap yellow and brown
laborer, and declaring that the yarn about the
danger of intermarriage, the increase of half-castes,
and the degradation of the national type was all
pure flam. Then, oyer the page, it printed an
interview with its friend, the boss local Chinese
missionary, Gee Wah, who said he had lately
married a South Australian girl, and mentioned
that, if the Chinese took wives at all, they had to
be European girls, as there are only two Chinese
women m Adelaide, and both of them are mar-
ried.
If the proposed Deakin-Reid coalition
comes to pass it will be, on the evidence of its
own programme, a very poor, weak, limp affair.
Consider such items as these :
Old Age Pensions : Steps to be taken to accomplish this
in co-operation w %th the States.
Immigration to be encouraged in co-operation with the
States.
Apparently the Coalition won’t dare to get its
hair cut except in co-operation with the States.
The soured and embittered John Forrest
spends his spare time now in concocting absurd
questions for the Ministry ; he can’t take his lick-
ing like a gentleman but must squeal over it. One
question tabled for the current week asks Premier
Watson if Defence Minister Dawson said some-
thing severe about the Cohentingenters four years
ago; and, if so, does Mr. Dawson still think so,
and does the Government agree with him. It is a
fearsome thing to have a small mind rumbling
about in a big body.
A “ Greater Perth Movement ” has begun
already. Curiously, “Dicky” Haynes, brother of
John, the leader of the vast N.S.W. Secessionist
army which has got mislaid somewhere, has set
himself at the head of the anti-movement over
there. He “ foresees a danger that the people of
outside municipalities (he is mayor of an outside
municipality) will be asked to pay exorbitant
rates to keep Perth up to concert pitch when they
have not roads in their own suburbs.” The pro-
vincial bee seem 3 to have hived in the Haynes
family bonnet.
“ B.” sends this scrap :
Without apparently knowing it, many who argue that
the Federal Capital territory shall consist of 1000 or 5000
square miles zigzagged between the Murray and Murrum-
bidgee are really laboring to partly undo the petty trick
successfully worked by Bishop Broughton in the old
N.S.W. Council at the separation of Victoria. Lord John
Russell’s despatch clearly marked out that N.S.W.
territory was to extend only to the Murrumbidgee, but
Broughton, then a legislator as well as a bishop, obtained
the despatch from Governor Gipps, and scoring out
“Murrumbidgee” inserted “Murray.” Most people in
N.S.W. and Victoria thought it was Lord John Russell
who had fixed the Murray.
The white man’s prestige is fading fast in
Asia. Last week the thoughtful Australian put
down his fork with the feeling that something
serious had happened when he read that the
Viceroy of Canton (China), all on his little own,
had sent four gunboats and two destroyers to
Macao to enforce the extradition of a fugitive
from his vice-regal justice. The town and terri-
tory of Macao belong to Portugal, and Portugal is
very small potatoes indeed, but till Asia had
listened with its mouth wide open to wondrous
tales of how the Jap had swept the Russian off
the sea and chased him helter-skelter from the
banks of the Yalu to Shan-shi-li-po, or some other
equally groggy-sounding name, no Chinese Vice-
roy would have dreamed of sending a naval expedi-
tion against any white power. Also, there seems to
be increasingly serious information about the
British “mission” in Thibet. If that force is
wiped out, Asia will begin to feel certain that
Europe is a back number.
Sydney Water and Sewerage Board, not
having been able to make ends meet for some
time, has decided to slightly increase the rates,
The proposal had been hardly mooted before the
rich Sydney citizens hastened to arrange a public
meeting to howl wildly in protest. Australia
seems to have been educated by its press into an
incurable objection to honesty in public finance.
The usually peaceful Sydney Mail some-
times rises to the occasion with a vigor that would
do credit to the most up-to-date of publications.
Its trenchant artiele on “The Angora Goat in
Australia,” published the week when-Bruce Smith
was performing about how he came to send his
child to a convent school, was one of the finest
bits of writing the old paper has done these many
years-
The selected “Reform” candidate for a
Sydney suburb won his selection by canvassing
from bouse to house in the day time, when the
men were in town, and promising the women that
if he got into Parliament he would introduce
legislation which would compel the men to be moral.
One young woman cast the candidate aside, with
the remark that she reckoned she was attractive
enough to keep her husband reasonably moral
without the aid of a small sawn-off Deformer, but
she was the exception. The women rolled up at
the selection meeting and plumped solid for the
compulsory moralist.
THE SYME-DEAKIN CURTAIN
LECTURES.
“Ho you hear me, Deakin? I say, a fine hash
you’ve made of it! What’s that ? I said
coalesce! Well, Deakin, I thought at least
you were truthful! I never said coalesce !
What do you say? ‘Shut up, old woman, or
you’ll give me one on me old nose ’? Well,
Deakin, after that-well -”
The recantation by Senator Millen (of
N.S.W.) of his land-nationalisation opinions comes
when he deems himself securely seated in Parlia-
ment for a considerable time. Men who turned
less important garments inside out have thought
themselves compelled in honor to ask their con-
stituents how they liked the change, but Mr.
Millen does not appear built that way. The
spectacle of a land, mining and property agent, or
any other unproductive person, undressing himself
and reversing his clothes in public isn’t a pictu-
resque sight at any time.
National Political League of Westralia is
splashing its funds about. Ex-parson Wheatley
fets £6OO a year as chief organiser, and spouts at
reary meetings which are usually attended by
the chairman of the local roads board, half-a-
dozen members of the W.C.T.U., and a stray
cockroach. There is also a secretary at £4OO,
besides a battalion who get 10s. a day for calling
at every house to see that the occupants are on
the roll. Fremantle branch also has a secretary,
who draws £8 per week for organising Toryism—
and sitting behind a table and counting the flies
on the wall.
Before a really hostile audience Bent, like
most bullies, is a rank coward. For the first time
during the campaign he struck a crowd at Fitzroy
Town Hall that had no regard for the cabbage-
man of Brighton, and as soon as he appeared on
the platform the air was torn with remarks and
split across with shrieks of objurgation. When he
essayed to speak- the tornado increased. Bent
went pale. He worked his mouth and lower jaw
impotently, producing no sounds. Then he hung
on to the table, and looked out on his 1500 oppon-
ents with a stupid, dazed glare. He looked like a
man frozen with fear. After continuing in this
attitude for ten minutes he lost his hold of the
table and fell into a chair, and there was no ora-
tion that night from T. Bent,
The Owe’Sulilvan has published a list total-
ling £8,000,000 worth of public works agitated for
by loud and violent Doformers, now stumping the
country with a cry against the Government’s
extravagance. The Deformers retort that if the
works were not of a character to justify their con-
struction, the Owe’Sullivan, as a responsible Minis-
ter, is to blame for constructing them. This
argument is loudly echoed by the Deform press ; but
it ignores the fact that the list is of jobs which the
extravagant Deformers demanded, but which the
Owe’Sullivan, being more economical than they,
has not carried out; and it was the refusal of the
Govt, to carry them out that led to most of the
defections from the Ministerial party. With a
strong daily paper at his back, O’Sullivan would
be able to make a great show of the Deformers
with his £8,000,000 list.
According to Remington, M.H.R. for
Rangitikei (M.L.) —who got there by one vote, at
the last election, on the Seddon ticket —political
life under Seddon is worse than the existence
of a homeless dog. Remington relates how
he went to Parliament “ believing himself
a free agent, and laboring under the
stupid delusion that his views would
receive a sympathetic hearing. But
one would require the hide of a rhino-
ceros to stand the sarcasm and the
overbearing intolerance of Mr. Sed-
don,” he moans. In caucus, it seems,
members are jumped upon by the big
burly man till they are so flat that they
would pass under a door. Remington
adds : ‘‘ To be roared at and told to
‘ Sit down, will you ! ’ when trying
to express your opinions, is a trying
experience.” But why didn’t Reming-
ton reply by telling Seddon to ‘ ‘ Dry
up ! ” Seddon couldn’t have killed him
more than once.
N.S. W. State Government is being
pestered by influential people who want
a small commission appointed to inquire
into the extent of Chinese gambling in
Sydney and suburbs. The last Chinese Gam-
bling Commission ran up a bill of £2064, and
didn’t leave a halfpenny-worth of footprint on
the sands of time.
Little Kelly of Wentworth (N.S.W.) put
this question lately in the Representatives :
Has his attention been dinoted to a statement in tht
Argus of the 20th May, 19(4 ,to the fact that “Labor
Ministers and members . . . button-holed all the dis-
affected radicals, and showed them official Labor League
letters, promising that they would not be opposed at the
next election if they supported the Ministry in its hour of
need ? ”
Is such statement correct ?
If so, will he give the House full particulars of the
contents of these official Labor League letters ?
Presumably little Kelly thinks, in the bumptious-
ness of his inherited wealth and his motor car,
that it is amusing to ask insulting questions of a
Premier who was once a compositor—questions
which he wouldn’t dream of asking a Premier
who was once a brewer or an importer or a founder
of bogus banks. One of the chief amusements of
the liog-like Tory member now is to dig out the
principal political lies from his favorite Tory paper
and waste the time of Parliament asking if they
are true.
The voice of J. D. Fitzgerald, the candi-
date that every sane and decent white elector
should vote for at Belmore when the N.S.W.
elections come round :
Put an end for ever to this reckless borrowing and reck-
less squandering of borrowed money. Some day you will
pay a fearful reckoning unless we put our house in order,
and that day is coming nearer (Cheers.) Foreign borrow-
ing is based on an economic fallacy. Most persons believe
that when we borrow abroad we get money brought
amongst us which circulates and does us good. (Hear,
hear.) Well, that is an absolute fallacy. (Cheers.) When
we borrow five millions on the London market, not one
penny cash, not one sovereign comes into the State.
What happens is this : We get, say, four millions of credit
in London for rails or bridges, or railway material, which
I, as a Protectionist, believe ought to be manufactured
locally in N.S. Wales, in order to give employment to our
own men and women. (Cheers.) Borrowing in London means
giving that employment to people elsewhere, while our
own are walking about doing nothing, or put to sand-
shifting or stone-cracking. (Cheers.) The other million
is given to us in the shape of credit on ourselves, which
practically amounts to local borrowing. (Hear, hear.)
If we are to borrow, let it be locally. This will encourage
thrift, and if small sums are accepted, as in France, the
thrifty poor will have a good secure investment for their
small savings. It will loosen money which is now locked
up in the vaults of our banks, and which ought to be put
into circulation. (Cheers.) It will afford safe and lucra-
tive investments for trust funds, and for investors who
are content with low rates of interest, so long as they get
security and a long currency of the investment. (Hear,
hear.)
THE MUDSLINGERS.
GEORGIE: “ It's my shot , I tell you. Its my
shot!”
THE WATSON BIRD: “Fire away! I don’t care
which of you it is—neither of you ever hits
anything.”
The Federal High Court is building up a
valuable reputation for serving out a good artiele
in the way of justice and doing it with the least
possible delay. It did an immense service to the
honest section of the mercantile community the
other day by squashing that nefarious and fraudu-
lent instrument, the secret or unregistered bill of
sale. The Privy Council would probably have
done the same thing—after about two years delay
and after the case had been dragged half-way
round the earth, but that isn’t quite the same
thing. The High Court has already saved its
judicial salaries and expenses twice over in costs,
and the saving in time is beyond calculation.
NOT CERTAIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. G. H. Reid declared, a few days ago, that the older
he grew the less certain he became about anything:, and
that it was only a matter of living long enough for him to
believe nothing.— -Sydney Telegraph (21/5/’O4).
All the country’s plunged in sorrow
For to-day and for to-morrow,
And the next day, and for ever and for ever ;
For the man whom we have trusted
With abounding faith has busted,
And to ashes turned the fruits of our endeavor.
’Tis a world of gay deceivers,
And of scoffing unbelievers,
And our own quick-change revolving politician,
Seeking Deakin’s soft caresses—
Seeking for a job, confesses
That he’s doubtful if he’s sure of his position.
Yes ! In sorrow let us drop the friendly curtain,
His sepulchre let’s shed a clod of dirt in :
The pillar of Freetrade
Has thrown up the game and said
He has doubts about the blessings of import,in’.
The position can be hardly called divertin’
(We have cabled, “Sendout no more socks and shirtin’”).
O ! We knew about his schemes,
And his shuffles and his dreams,
But we never, never dreamt he wasn’t certain.

The treatment by the Sydney press of the
proceedings in the Australian Parliament con-
tinues to show how Protectionists and Democrats
are handicapped by the lack of a morning paper
or even a live evening one. For instance, Wm.
Hughes’ masterly and merciless exposure of Reid’s
past record was cut down to almost nothing, and
all the most telling points left out ; but the reply
by Dugald Thomson was given at length, though
S.M. Herald admitted that Thomson was
“ rather dry and not so good as usual.”

Dear Sir, —As a life-long abstainer, a Son of Temperance,
and Good Templar, I, for years past, recognised
Drunkenness—a disease, not a crime. When you, in
1896, introduced your Eucrasy Treatment I became
keenly interested and recommended it, so that I could
more closely watchits results. My experience, with what
I may term my patients, has been such that I can without
hesitation testify to its curative effects, and, without any
soliciting on your part, I give you this testimonial
believing sincerely that by so doing I am carrying out my
Temperance pledges, “ To do all in my power to advance
the cause.”
I wish you success, for every patient cured adds to the
influence the Temperance Party require to enact
Prohibitory laws.
You are at liberty to use this testimonial as you deem
fit. Yours sincerely,
W. F. STANTON, J.P.

most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I should say Chlorodyne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a la*rge number of simple ailments forma
its best recommendation.”

SPORTING NOTIONS.
A well-known Melbourne sporting solicitor is
a man of generous proportions—standing 6ft. sin. and
weighing over 17 stone. Some little time ago, at the in-
vitation of a well-known jockey, he attended a suburban
race meeting. He was “to put a bit on’’for the jock,
and he arranged to see the latter on the way to the
course. They met • • id the jock handed the solicitor a
pass for the paddock The pass was a jockey’s ticket.
“ What’s the good of this to me,” said Goliath the con-
veyancer. “ That’s all right,” said the jock. “The bloke
at the gate won’t notice it, and you can bustle in on it.”
The solicitor decided to risk it, remarking, “ If it’s only a
question of bustling, well, that’s me.” He presented the
ticket at the gate and marched on quickly. The gate-
keeper', however, called him back. “This ticket is no
good to you ; it’s a jockey’s ticket.” The solicitor : “ I’m
riding to-day.” The gatekeeper: “Riding be damned—
there ain’t no elephant race to-day ! ” And the solicitor
passed out.
* * * *
“Jumbo” : A new kind of “sport” has been
started up country way. At race meetings nowadays it
is a common pastime for sporting enthusiasts to throw a
solid, cubical-shaped weight (iron), about 3£lb , at a dingo
which is attached to a long rope fastened to a pole. On
one side there is an enclosure, and at a given signal the
dog is freed and rushes for the enclosure—some 20 yards
distant. The competitor stands 20 yards away from the
post, and throws his hunk of metal after the fleeing
animal at one penny a shot. The prize is the dingo, if
killed. But few are killed or even hit, and the richest
man at the end of the day’s sport is the promoter. What
he pays to square the police not to run him in for
disgusting brutality may, however, make a hole in his
profits.

Ormonde, the unbeaten, died under chloroform
last week. When the Duke of Westminster sold Ormonde
to a South American buyer in 1889, and the British public
complained that the dook was rich enough to have known
better, it was stated in excuse for the sale that the great
horse had turned “ roarer,” but four years later he was
sold again for £30,000 to go to California. Orme, an
elderly son of Ormonde, has perpetuated the family fame
in England. Flying Fox, winner of the Two Thousand,
Derby, and Leger, was the son of Orme, and now Flying
Fox is proving himself a valuable sire.

Upshot of the Maoriland “ Gladsome case” is a
heavy facer for J. B. Reid, erst owner of the mare, now
owned by a Melbourne bookie. When she was winning
all before her in M.L. she was ridden by an apprentice
named Jones. After the Wellington Cup, W. H. Young,
owner of Convoy, second horse, claimed the stake on the
ground that an apprentice’s license wasn’t sufficient;
Jones should have had a jockey’s license. The W.R.C.
disallowed the protest, and the public scoffed at Young.
However, he appealed to the Racing Conference, and
offered to wager £lOO that he was in the right. The
Appeal Board of that body decided in his favor. Conse-
quence is that Reid has to refund the Wellington Cup
stake (and other stakes if asked) —something over £2OOO.
There are as many traps in racing law as in the other
article.

The stewards of the S.A. J.O. have decided that
the winner of the Totalisator Handicap on May 14th was
not Macleay, by Goodfellow—Orphan Girl, as the nomina-
tion stated, but an unknown animal which the owner had
“rung in.” The owner was disqualified for life in con-
sideration of the dodge that nearly came off. A good many
similar frauds have quite come off.

An English sporting-writer has dug out some
remarkable old-time records. At Newmarket Craven
meeting of 1873, 39 races were held in the four days. Two
resulted in walks-over for Lord Falmouth. In the 37 other
races M. Lefevre ran 23 horses, had 14 winners, 34 seconds,
two thirds, and only one unplaced horse. On the last
day, he had three walks-over. Lefevre’s favorite jockey,
Fordham, had 16 mounts, 10 winners, four seconds, one
third, and finished once out of a place.
Heavy going and small attendance at Rosehill
Saturday, due to adverse weather conditions, probably
caused the elimination of all but 5 of 15 carded for the
Steeple, this in face of the fact that most of the mal-
contents were on the ground. Race proved sensational.
Hurdler Toonga lined up favorite at 7 to 4 and was the
only one who succeeded in getting over the journey—•
Sateen, Coal King, Hathi and Illusion came croppers.

Queensland hasn’t for a very long time had a
better colt than Fitz-Grafton. Tuesday last saw him
follow up his Derby triumph and Leger record-breaking
performance by appropriating Brisbane Cup and making
(as in the Leger) all his own running. Cup time (3.29) is
a Queensland best for the distance (2 miles) and only fsec.
slower than Carbine’s Australian record. Task of winning
throughout was an undoubted big one to set a three year
old, but the crack got through it handsomely.

A profitable investment : Silkworm, bought as
a yearling by Mr. G. Stead for 100 gs., has, in his first
season, won £1790 in stakes alone. Silkworm is by Seaton
Delaval, whose two-year-olds have now headed the list
three years in succession.

Queensland Turf Club’s Autumn meeting came
to a muddy, rain-soaked conclusion at Eagle Farm (Bris-
bane) on Saturday. The attendance was poor, and only
£3649 went on the totalisator. The only respectable
dividend of the day was that on the big race, the More-
ton Handicap, in which St. Quentin paid £8 95., and the
second horse £1 11s. The lowest return was when Sir
Leonard secured the Royal Stakes by a head in 2m. OJsec.,
and paid out 17s. only. Altogether it was a sad day, and
everybody seemed to be in the wet in every sense of the
word.

Adelaide had ideal weather for its “ Birthday ”
Meeting. The Hurdle Race, a 2J mile fixture, was some-
what exciting. Herd Laddie broke away from the field at
the start, but was caught a little more than half way and
then fell with Bombastes. That gave Sarasati the chance
to get to the front and win easily, with Herd Laddie six
lengths behind. The dividend was really pretty—£42l9s.
The race of the day was the City Handicap of 7 furlongs.
Nineteen started, carrying £2916 of the public’s money
among them. Bonnie Chiel with 9st. 71bs. up humped
the largest amount, £623, and next came Chassepot with
Bst. 51bs. and £442. The excitement commenced two
furlongs from home when Chatter streaked away from
Enigma (8.4) and Antilles (7.12). The latter drew up and
took the lead. Then outsider Cserleon with his 6st. 91bs.
came up like a bird, but Morrison got Antilles’ forced
draught working and managed to stave off the outsider
and landed home half a length to the good. Chassepot,
which made a bad start, was third. Dividends were
£lO 2s. Antilles and £4 ss. Cserleon. Why Adelaide
called its mixture of frivol and gamble “ the Birthday ”
meeting is beyond comprehension. Whose birthday it
was in honor of was not even explained, but presumably
it was in connection with that of the late Victoria. There
is something undertakerish in celebrating a corpse’s
birthday.

S.A. Jockey Club has successfully defended a
curious action. Plaintiff, an Adelaide lawyer, took two
totalisator tickets on a race at Morphettville, last January,
saw his horse run second, and, after returning to town,
tore his tickets up and threw them away in the street.
Next day, he saw in the paper that the winner had been
disqualified, and the race given to the horse he backed, so
he hunted for his tickets and found some pieces of them
still in the mud. Unfortunately, the upper parts, with
the name of the race, were missing, so there was only
the color of the tickets to suggest what race they repre-
sented—nothing, in fact, to prove that they had not been
saved up from some previous meeting. Also, the tear
went right through the embossed number, which repre-
sents the horse, and the bit of a “ 4 ” still showing looked
as much like a dissipated “8” as anything else. Under
the circumstances, the club declined to part, and the
Court held that the plaintiff had not made out a clear
case. The amount involved was only £4 18s., but the legal
instinct makes a solicitor rush in where a lay person would
let it slide.

Cabled that Australian-bred and owned Narrow
Escape, won Wairarapa Coursing Cup atMasterton (M.L.)
t’other day. Narrow Escape is a second season bitch by
Young Heyfield out of Federation, and scales about 541bs.
She shaped very promisingly in Sydney last year. Narrow
Escape would have made things warm for the Waterloo
Cup at Dunedin a week or two before but for a mistaken
decision against her in the third ties when she really won
well. The name Narrow Escape was given through the
fact that the bitch went perilously near being shot dead
when a puppy—and still carries the bullet in her head.

How they do it up country in Bananaland.
Recently, at St. George, in Flying Handicap (sfur.), Storm
(9.7) won by a head after a great finish with Bettina (9.2)
and Madam Garfield, who dead-heated. Later, same after-
noon, Bettina (9.1) turned the tables on Storm (9.13) in
Shorts Handicap (4fur.), winning cleverly by three-
quarters of a length. Stewards investigated, and imposed
two-years disqualification on Bettina for “inconsistent
running,” and also deprived her of the Shorts Handicap
prize. Seeing that Bettina ran Storm to a head at a
difference of 51bs., and vanquished Storm at a difference of
421b5., the writer, so far away from the scene of trouble,
fails to see the merest tinge of a charge of “ inconsistent
running.” Fortune wasn’t with the Bettina party the
least little bit that day.

How they drop. Once very prominent and fre-
quently much fancied (for high-class events) Nordenfeldt-
Nellie Moore gelding, Steadfast, was bought in a Perth
(W.A.) sale yard t’other day by an Afghan for £3, and the
buyer kicked vigorously at not getting the saddle and
bridle too. M.L. sport, Spencer Gollan, purchased
Steadfast as a yearling for 1050 guineas, and, later, the
late W. R. Wilson owned him. Steadfast won some
races, but generally proved a big disappointment; he is
full brother to V.R.C. St. Leger winner Culloden, and
half brother to Lochiel.

Somebody ought to write “ How to Make a
Wrestling Boom.” Two days prior to Jack Oarkeek’s
arrival the gay and gaudy Merzouk and manager
Victor Sabas suddenly burst upon Sydney, where
wrestling had been for years apparently as dead as Julius
Caesar. Australia was challenged for £lOOO a side, and,
Great Scot 1 TWENTY POUNDS put up as proof of sin-
cerity. Sabas told the papers that previous to coming
here, allegedly from Bombay, or elsewhere, the
heavily laced and jewelled Merzouk had beaten Hacken-
schmidt, the Russian who recently threw Terrible Turk
Madralli in London. “What made you visit Australia?”
asked a newspaper man. “Oh, we wanted to see the
place, and we heard the Jap wrestlers were here ! ” said
Sabas, innocently. Then Carkeelc came sailing up the
Beautiful in the Orient. Before he appeared a Gaelic
stranger was observed about town, and at Car-
keek’s first appearance he stripped in first - class
fix and wrestled for that £lO as “ Robertson of
Katoomba.” After two more appearances he became
Oarkeek’s wrestling partner, and occasionally has
a fling at well-known local man Harry Pearce. Sabas
then lifted his £2O, and offered to try and qualify for the
£lO offered by Carkeek to any man staying 15 minutes
with him. Sabas tells the crowd that catch-as-catch-can
is not his style, and is promptly thrown. Then Carkeek,
at the Frenchman’s earnest solicitation, undertakes to
throw him at Grseco-Roman style or forfeit the £lO.
Carkeek fails—Sabas survives the 15 minutes. Then
Carkeek undertakes to throw Sabas three times in half
an hour, and does it amidst intense excitement in 24
minutes. The hungering audience was informed that
Merzouk and Carkeek will meet at the National Sporting
Club for £5OO a side. Three days after Merzouk offered to
essay staying with Carkeek 15 minutes, Graeco-Roman
method, if the champion would agree to forfeit £25 in the
event of Merzouk succeeding. Jack enthusiastically
agreed. This match was to take place after Tub Bulletin
had gone to press. Graeco-Roman is the big Tunisian’s
only style and not Carkeek’s at all; but, in the meantime,
what about their £5OO a side tussle ?
* * * *
The Russian is not the only person who is
going down before the Jap. Brown Man Yukio Tani
recently wiped the floor of the London Tivoli Music
Hall with Jem Mellor, the English champion lightweight
wrestler, twice out of three times for a £4OO prize. The
Englishman was stronger than the Jap, but the latter
was a miracle in agility. Jim secured the first fall,
and became more confident. The two occasions on which
Tani mopped the mat with the Briton’s shoulders the
latter seemed to have the Asiatic hopelessly beaten—then
there was a wriggle, a twist, and the positions were re-
versed, and the white man was bumped decisively.
* * * *
The wrestling boom is in full blast in S’ Africa,
where Jack Sutherland, an Australian, has so far beaten
everything offering. There are said to be sacks of money
waiting to back him against Tom Cannon, the English
champion.

A prominent wrestler at the London ’alls is
young man Whistler, of Manchester. Any relation to
Clarence Whistler, the “ hammerlock ” wrestler, who
used to drink a quart of champagne at one draught and
then chew the bottle ?

“Steve”: Strolled along Castlereagh-street,
Sydney, t’other night when the rain was merrily teem-
ing down, and for a moment thought I had struck a public
swimming bath. A row of naked men stood along the
footpath from the N.S. Club to the Imperial Arcade as if
ready to plunge into the street, which in the light
resembled a bath. It was only an illusion. The naked
men were the life-size posters of Carkeek, the wrestler,
and the boxers at the Club which line the footpath there-
abouts.
* * * *
“Spinaker”: Re “J.S.” (Bulletin, 12/5/’O4)
and his yearning for more strenuous cricket. Could have
shown him some pretty willing games among the miners
back of Walhalla a year or two back. Have in mind one
Christmas Day a game played at Matlock between the
Toerags and the T. A. Gully teams for a barrel of beer. A
new drink shop had dealt out alleged white wine all the
morning. It was currently supposed to be made from
nightshade berries and fortified with vitriol. This was
taken in large quantities by the population as a thirst-
producer in view of the barrel of beer, which barrel was
broached immediately the game commenced. Hostilities
started when Bluey the Nut aimed his bat with precision
at the umpire for giving him out when only two of his
stumps were down. Bluey was promptly sent to sleep by
the wicket-keeper with the other stump. In seven
seconds there were ten battles raging on the matting.
At first the matting was reserved solely for members
to kill each other on, but as things got warmer
these delicate touches of courtesy were forgotten,
and barrackers and players mixed with impar-
tiality. The last thing I can remember distinctly
was trying to disable Bill the Scoop (so-called for his
shovelling proclivities) while he was tangled in his shirt,
which he tried to remove hurriedly without unbuttoning
it. Didn’t reckon I was taking an unfair advantage, as
Bill stood. 6£ft. high, and I was only sft. Bin. Bill got out
of his shirt sooner than I expected—l had no axe, and
was trying to slay him by hand—and I remember no
more. Most of us were able to resume work within a
week or two. The only evidence the police could collect
was purely circumstantial, as everyone was either laid
out by a bat, or beer, or something. Mullocky Dan was
found with a bat the dent in which fitted the swelling on
the scorer’s head, but this evidence was deemed in-
sufficient to convict. Have seen war when the Artillery-
men in Albany (Westralia) used to meet the mill hands
from Denmark. Have been in the ring among the
miners and navvies at Menzies when the nob went up, and
have also watched a fair skirmish from under a billiard-
table when everyone was hitting the nearest head with a
cue ; but only considered these as Sunday-school games
alongside that cricket match.

Melbourne v. Essendon, at Sydney Cricket
Ground, which was to have been a glittering demonstra-
tion of the Australian game of football, was marred by
wet weather. Saturday struggled into dawn through
DON WALKER, Australasian Representative
at the World’s Cycling Championship, to be held
in September, at Crystal Palace, London.

sheets of falling rain, and although by midday the sun
was shining and thin spirals of steam rising from the
water-logged city, there was a threatening dampness in
the air. The ground was a bog, with a lake in the
centre, but in spite of the slippery leather and heavy
going the display was a splendid one, and deserved better
luck in the way of attendance. Only 6000 people, includ-
ing G.-G. Northcote and Viking Harry, were present, and
a painfully large proportion of these were deadhead
ticket-holders. The teams seemed absolutely equal, and
their fast and scientific play under such adverse condi-
tions sent away many Rugbyites (including the writer),
who had come to scoff, admitting that it was a rattling
good game, and every whit as manly and vigorous as
Rugby.
It is more of an individualistic game than
Rugby. In the latter, individual play, no matter how
brilliant, is generally ruinous. In the Australian game
there is no “offside”; the men are placed all over the
field, even within potting distance of the enemy’s goal,
and no matter where the leather may be they stay in their
positions waiting for the ball to come their way and bring
with it an opportunity to score. The “ centre forward,”
standing within range of the hostile goal, may take a
mark off his own followers’ kick and score off it at his
leisure. There is no sanctity about the holy space
between the posts in the Australian game. Every player
has a vis-a-vis of the opposite team, whose chief end and
object of existence is to see that he does not mark, and
the game is a series of single combats. It encourages and
develops accurate kicking, and on that account no player
is ever idle very long. From the safety point of view,
this writer could see no advantages in the Australian
game. Quite a number of players were “ shaken up ” on
Saturday when four men sprang to take a mark and four
others jumped to secure it for the other side. Several
players were badly kicked, and one had to be rubbed
vigorously before he could resume the perpendicular. The
fact that every player is constantly attended by an
opponent who never leaves him and whom he will not
leave for half a second, is conducive to rough play on the
part of the unruly spirits.
Considering the bad state of the ground and the
slippery leather the play was brilliant. Both teams picked
up with lightning rapidity and kicked with both feet im-
partially. Under the conditions drop-kicking was
almost an impossibility—the ball wouldn’t rise ; but
the punting was a revelation. The ball was sent with
amazing accuracy to the player who could make the best
use of it. Instead of passing with the hand to a player
six or ten yards away, these fellows did it with their feet
while running at full speed to someone 20 or 30 yards
away, or half way down the ground. If Sydney Rugby
could only get to the same state of perfection the chances
of that English team wouldn’t look so rosy. And yet, so
powerful a thing is prejudice, or established taste, in spite
of the high-class quality of the game, it didn’t seem to
satisfy ; and this writer came away feeling as he did when
he rushed for underdone steak, after leaving the vege-
tarian cafe, where he had feasted on 11 courses, caramel
coffee and two kinds of unfermented wine or something.
The teams seemed to be absolutely equal till
M'Kenzie, an Essendon follower, fell and injured his
knee so that he had to be carried off the ground. His
loss was irreparable, and from that time onward the
Essendons were surely beaten. There was always one
Melbourne man shaking a free leg and marking at plea-
sure, with no one to watch him, and he apparently turned
the scale. After a magnificent struggle, and just as dark-
ness was coming down with a rush, the game ended in a
victory for Melbourne by 71 to 39 points, or 9 goals 17
behinds to 6 goals and 3 behinds.
* ■* * *
N.S.W. Football League’s official programme of
the Melbourne-Essendon match was a humorous produc-
tion. After the reader had absorbed the plan of the
ground, the names and numbers of the players, the rules
of the game, &c., he bumped on to an undertakers’ adver-
tisement which stated“ Our privilege for the past half-
century has been to perform the ‘last kind offices to
mortal need ’ for some FORTY THOUSAND fellow crea-
tures. ”, Talk about the skeleton at the feast!!! One
came to see football and had information about 40,000
dead bodies thrown at him.

In the Sydney Rugby Premiership competition,

three and drawn one. Eastern Suburbs, Balmain and
Western Suburbs are the weaklings so far; E.S. and
Balmain have each gained one match and lost three,
while W.S. has won none and only succeeded in drawing
two.

Some 7000 people swarmed into University Oval
to watch the Rugby match N. Sydney v. Newtown. The
ground was a mixture of quagmire and lake, and there
was some doubt as to whether it was football or sculling
championship. It was a weird tussle and the unexpected
was the only thing that happened. The forwards on both
sides played a game that, considering the state of the
ground, was marvellously fast. The only score was a
penalty goal kicked by N. Sydney in the” first half. A
decided improvement was the repeated attempt on the
part of Newtown to score field goals. South Sydney and
University had a 3000 crowd at the Sports Ground where
the field was in better condition. South Sydney forwards
bustled the Uni. men and by half time had scored 6 to nil.
In the second half the Uni. team pulled itself together and
commenced a series of good passing rushes, and in the end
it won its hardest match by 8 points to 6. Glebe and
Western Suburbs played a colorless and scoreless game at
the Agricultural Ground. At Hampden Park the Eastern
Suburbs ran over the Balmainers, notching 14 points to
nil.

“You make no mistake about the influence of
cricketers on public opinion,” said a third-rate bat-wielder
at a meeting the other day. “ Where’s Kipling since he
libelled visas ‘ flannelled fools’? We simply sat on him,
and the public, following our example, sits on him still.”
Great thumping of the table by the injured parties.
They take their cross-country running very
seriously in England. A championship for London
“ business houses ” alone brought out 17 teams last
month. First six home of each club counted, but most
teams ran about ten, to allow for possible accidents on
the way. The first anaemic counter-jumper did his five
miles of open country (and English ploughland in a rainy
April is no joke) in 34min. 19sec., and 15 were home within
4 minutes of him.

“Nym” : Owing to the long and mild Autumn,
following the heavy rains, angling has been possible later
this year than I can ever remember, and what is more, fish
have been biting freely, notwithstanding that the rivers
have fallen pretty low during the last few weeks. Thou-
sands of “ sprats ” have been sacrificed through the insane
idea of having a minimum weight for fish under the
Fisheries Act ! Why not have a minimum hook —one
that no small cod could take, and the rest of the tribes
will save their babies —and make it a severe offence to be
found fishing with a hook of less than the legal size ?

A world’s record, surely ? Malvern No. 2 la-
crosse club, opposed to St. Kilda No. 2 on Saturday
threw 41 goals to nil.
Sturdy little Sydney pug., Casey, skilful and ag-
gressive enough to fig-ht anyone of his own class, was beaten
last week at Sydney National,' as usual on points. Casey
lacks hitting power ; in a roughing match he can hold his
own with anyone, but men like Hock Keys and Andrews,
his latest conqueror, notch points through superior skill.
They are poor hitters, too,, and if Casey could only land
heavily enough when he does get home, their superior
scoring ability wouldn’t matter—but he can’t. Hitting
is not so much a matter of strength as of knowing how to
do it. Strength and weight of arm do not always render
a blow effective. The hardest hitters have been light-
armed men and reasonably free from muscle about the
shoulders—Torpedo Billy Murphy, for instance.
* * * .*
There was a touch of wild-cat ferocity .in tlia
Murphy-Cooper scrap, at Sydney Gaiety, on Saturday
night. Although Cooper’s fist, gave him an advantage of
81b. in weight, Murphy attacked with all the vigor his
name suggests. There is something very terrible about
the name of Murphy, properly pronounced ; it is a sort of
antithesis of Babylonia and Wyoming. Both pugs were
knocked down repeatedly. In the sixth and seventh
rounds the floor flew up and hit Murphy so hard that
some people reckoned he was done, but he recovered, and
in the tenth Cooper’s seconds threw in the wipe of a
slugged-out bruiser.

Don Walker, who goes to the world’s champion-
ships meeting in London at the expense of the Canada
Cycle and Motor Co., Ltd., has been racing for 14 years,
and during that time has won £3500 in prize money,
which is not a bad living in itself. He leaves in the Sierra
on June 6th with Major and Mrs. Taylor. After spending
a few days at Taylor’s home the two sprinters will leave
for France, where they will make their first appearance,
and will be racing continually up to the great meeting at
the Crystal Palace. While wishing Walker the very best
of luck, Tim Bulletin' has no great hopes of his doing
anything which will endanger the combustible shipping
on the Thames. Walker doesn’t seem to have enough
heart for a great champion. Once he has been passed
after getting the lead he seems to throw up the sponge.

The Goulburn-Sydney Road Race is now fixed
for August 6th, and is likely to be attended by the
famous Arnst family from Maoriland. The event is pro-
moted by the Dunlop Tyre Co. with the aid of the cycling
trade, and run under its direct supervision. The League
of Wheelmen does the handicapping. The prize list is
considerable, totalling approximately £l2O, and includes
£3O, a £5 medal, blue ribbon and badge, all by the Dunlop
Co., in addition to which the co. will pay the fastest
time maker £lO to compete in the Warrnambool-Mel-
bourne Road Race. The Canada Cycle and Motor Co. and
Messrs. Bennett and Wood donate bikes ; T. S. Henderson
throws in a ten-guinea breechloading gun and fixings,
with which the successful winner can go on the road.
Medals and cheques are put up by the Metropolitan Cycle
and Motor Co., Ophir Cycle Works, Mr. Strelein, and the
Austral Cycle Agency ; while the Summer Nig'hts Syndi-
cate gives a free entry and acceptance for the next Sydney
Thousand. The Dunlop Co. has made all arrangements
for breakfast and other refreshments along the route, and,
altogether, things look very rosy for the competitors.
Martyr to Kidney Trouble.
Mb. Edmund Quinlan, 39 Oxford Street, Pad-
dington, tells what Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills did for Him.
What disorder causes such mental and physical
agony as when the kidneys are diseased ? They
act as a filter for the blood, and when they are
stopped up the entire system becomes affected.
The liver —so intimately associated with the
kidneys—also fails to perform its proper duties.
No better testimony as to the great medicinal
value of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills could be
offered than that of Mr. Quinlan, who, as he says,
was a “martyr to kidney trouble.” We use his
own words :
“For many years I was a martyr to kidney
trouble; my back was so bad that my work
became a misery to me, in fact I had to give it up
for months. I was recommended to try Indian
Root Pills by a friend of mine who had derived
great benefit from them, and I must bless that
friend for drawing my notice to them. To say
that I only derived benefit from them would not
be enough, for I can faithfully and honestly say
that they effected a perfect cure. I can vouch for
this, and am very glad to be able to give this
testimonial, with the hope that others may be
cured as I was. I can not too highly praise them,
for they are a wonderful medicine, and you may
use this testimonial in any way you please.”
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills act on the kidneys
and liver direct as no other remedy does. They
unstop the kidneys, put life in the liver, and a
move in the bowels. For all diseases arising from
a disordered condition of these organs and a weak
stomach, Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are an
infallible cure. They cure constipation, indiges-
tion, and biliousness so they stayed cured. Packed
in amber bottles, and sold throughout Australasia.*
Father Robinson’s Art Union—the out-
come of his Record Bazaar—looks very like a first
attempt to divert some of the Tatt. “ Consulta-
tion ” into holier channels. Tickets are ss. each ;
the first prize is a property which sold for £4OOO a
few months ago, and is probably worth more
rather than less. ,If the Sweep fills satisfactorily
Father Robinson will not be the sort of business
man to sleep on his laurels. He’ll have another
church debt to pay off and a second art union, to
be drawn at Cup time perhaps. There are other
good showmen besides Father R., but he has the
advantage of being able to spell the adjective
with a capital G.*
We read of love, we read of war,
Of val’rous deeds and mystic lore.
But then, we’ve read it all before,
And yearn for something newer.
There’s nothing fresh, the world is stale,
And weary as a twice told tale.
Yet stay ! when coughs and colds prevail,
There’s Woods’ Great Peppermint Cure.*

A worthy example in the minor honesties
of Ministerial life would be set by the Government
that would place frankly on the Estimates the
ca3h appropriated as expenses by Ministers when
“seeing the country.” The sum used should be
set opposite the Ministers’ names and presented
to Parliament in an annual statement by the
Treasurer.
Seddon, the sick man of M.L., jibbed at
the desolate Chathams as a sanatorium at the last
minute, much to the disappointment of the other
Ministers who had hoped to have something to do
during his enforced absence. Instead, the Hine-
moa left for the placid retreat of the Marlborough
Sounds. The monotony of gazing at beautiful
fiord scenery away from the telegraph exasperated
the sick Premier, and he was back again m
Wellington within the week. More medical pres-
sure was brought to bear, and the Hinemoa was
shoved out to sea ag*ain by the Pharmaceutical
Society. Auckland was its destination, but
Seddon wished “to say something to the people, ’
so the boat called at Gisborne to pick up mails
and worry. Before leaving Wellington Seddon
dashed off an article on infant mortality. He
simply can’t be kept away from work.

(Rev.) D. H. COM ANN, Franklin, N.C.,
“ Jayne’s Expectorant is a most effective CEOUP
REMEDY. I have used it with my children, and kept it
on hand constantly.”*
A suggestion from a Bulletin correspon-
The new regulations issued by Vic. Railway Oommis-
s mers Taitandco. (not much is heard of the “co ” of
late) relating to the hours of signalmen are in marked
contrast to the attitude of ex-Oommissioner Mathieson
towards this important body of railway men. Mathieson
improved the condition and status of signalmen, believing
them worthy of every consideration. Tait increases their
hours of duty, and otherwise treats them as of very
second-rate importance. Mathieson was British trained,
fait is Canadian. Note the average deaths by railway
accidents in Canada as compared with Britain.
The temporary marriage is an Australian
institution. A lady who sought divorce through
Justice Hood, in Melbourne lately, on the grounds
of desertion, cruelty, and other objectionable
habits, was just about to get her decree when she
casually let slip a remark about a former mar-
riage. His Honor put the case back for more
evidence, but, on re-hearing, the lady tearfully
pleaded that she could tell hardly anything. She
had only known her first husband for four hours
before they were married, and he left her nine
days afterwards because she accused him of having
another wife living. She and the police had tried
to find him, but he had faded away and left no
trace. It was just a cursory, transitory happen-
ing, like a week at the seaside or a trip to I rank-
ston, or something equally evanescent and trifling.
His Honor gave her her decree and remarked
svmpathetically that she seemed to have been un-
fortunate in her matrimonial speculations. Her
position now is uncertain. Apparently she isn t
sure whether she was married to her first husband ;
if he had another wife living she wasn t, and if he
hadn’t she presumably was, unless she had a pre-
vious husband living, which apparently she
hadn’t. If she was married to him, .which she
apparently doesn’t know, and if he isnt dead,
which may be, then she wasn’t legally married to
her second husband, and the divorce leaves her as
much married as before. Some general cleaning-
up process is much needed in such cases.

The inner circle of Carruthers’ Deform
party in N.S. AY. is made up of “ Jocky Garland
and ex-mayor Jimmy Graham (who should be
asked to give up his Parliamentary ambitions and
serve his country by becoming Expectoration
Inspector in Sydney; since Graham left the
mayoralty the anti-spitting city by-law is gener-
ally ignored). There is in the party a ‘cave
made up of Wade and others who lean towards
John Stinson ; and there is also the John Haynes
cave, which is generally well furnished with ideas
but sadly lacks lodgers.
How Deakin must despise the Freetrade
press in Australia ! It is only a few months ago
that it was denouncing him as an inhuman mob-
ster who pitchforked shipwrecked sailors back
into the raging sea from Australian shores.
During the Petnana episode the leader-writers on
the Freetrade press grew grey searching their
dictionaries for bad names to hurl at him and his
brutal colleagues. Now that they want to trap
him into an alliance with their slippery Joss,
Reid, they are slobbering all over him in this
fashion (sample from the Akgus) :
It may be admitted at once that Mr. Deakin was placed
in a trying position, particularly trying to a man more
than usually endowed with
“ Sweet sensibility which dwells enshrined
In the fine foldings of the feeling mind.”
| Fancy the Deakin that the Abgus depicted a few
months ago being more than usually endowed with
, ‘ 1 sweet sensibility ” and keeping that substance m
, a “ feeling mind.” Then he was rather a callous
assassin who kept his blood-stained axe in the
coal-scuttle.

The Best Tobacco Sold.
Death of journalist-explorer H. M. Stanley
recalls his account of his meeting with Dr. Living-
stone in Central Africa in 1871, which is often
quoted as an example of the inadequacy of
language to express the feelings in exceptional
circumstances :
I came in front of the semi-circle of Arabs, in front of
which stood the white man with the grey beard. I would
have run to him, only I was a coward in the presence of
such a mob—would have embraced him, only, he being
an Englishman, I did not know how he would receive me.
So I did what cowardice and false pride suggested was
the best thing—walked deliberately to him, took off my
hat, and said:
“ Dr. Livingstone, I presume ? ”
“Yes,” he said, with a kind smile, lifting his cap
slightly.
I replace my hat on my head, and he puts on his cap,
and we both grasp hands, and then I say aloud :
“ I thank God, Doctor, that I have been permitted to
see you.”
He answered : “ I feel thankful that I am here to wel
come you.”
But, after all, what more was to be said ?
The sort of item you meet with daily in
the Jewhannesburg papers. (Jew’burg Stab,
19/3/’O4): —
In C court this morning, before Mr. H. H. Jordan,
several natives were fined £1 each, or in default seven
days imprisonment, for walking on the footpath.
Australia only endeavors to keep the nigger off a
country that isn’t his, and our blessed Bruce
Smith is almost shocked to death over the
matter, and talks about the proceeding as un-
English. And in the Transvaal, under direct
British rule, the miserable nigger is fined £1 for
being found walking in his own country.

“ Burglar Bill ” : All this talk of coalition
reminds me of this. A confidence man, who had
thieved an umbrella from a hotel, handed it to a
respectable person with whom he had just scraped
acquaintance, and asked him to kindly carry it
until he buttoned his gloves. The respectable
person, not knowing the character of his com-
panion, did so. When they were half-way down
the street the owner of the gamp pursued them
and indignantly demanded his property. The
honest man said it belonged to his friend, but the
spieler denied ownership, and said that he was
astonished at finding himself in the company of
a common thief. As a result the honest man was
handed over to a policeman and got six months.
That was a coalition. And if it had been a
Premier’s portfolio instead of an umbrella the
moral would be just the same.
“ Scrub Lessee ” : There may be some
truth in the suggestion (B. 12/5/’O4) that Mr.
“ Tom ” Hi ssall was so heart-broken at the checks
he met with in his efforts to get closer settlement
that he left N.S.W. declaring that it is a place for
good men to keep out of. The north-western pas-
toralists who knew plain, bluff, honest Tom will
doubtless recall the rooted aversion to checks,
however trifling. When a Minister for Lands is
doing his level best to bring about a settlement, it
is only natural that he should feel disheartened
when he is confronted by checks from those who
have benefited most by his careful administration.
Until the Lands Department is run by three Com-
missioners, instead of having to struggle along
under the rule of a solitary Minister, the demand
for prompt settlement will always be liable to
meet with checks similar to those which forced
Mr. “ Tom” Ha, ssall to depart heart-broken from
our shores.
Lately-deceased explorer, H. M. Stanley,
lectured to unenthusiastic houses in Melbourne
12 or 13 years ago. The miasma of African rivers
and jungle was in his blood ; the strange whining
keynote of the forest stole into his discourses. He
never stopped to say bright things about the free
and independent gorilla who swooped sometimes
upon their fried onions and inadequate yams. He
never saw the whimsical side of the swamp-bred
dwarf with the long arms, that rushed the cold pie
whenever it strayed behind. Even the spindly
giraffe raided his mule fodder in a serious spirit.
One night at Melbourne Opera House, in the
middle of his lecture, a woman leaned from the
gallery and said, “Are you the bloke what flogged a
black girl because she took a bowl of milk from yer
table for her baby ? ” The question disturbed and
side-tracked him into trivial explanations. He
was sick in equatorial Africa, he said, deadly sick,
and the crowds of women with babies looted his
camp mercilessly. The women were insatiable
thieves and liars—he glared at the woman in the
gallery; the fear of death did not prevent them
stealing a sick white man’s food. It was a lumber-
ing explanation, and was delivered as heavily as a
ton of coals. Stanley suffered from ivory-hunger,
and his dealings with Emin Bey were shady and
unpicturesque. Finally he married Beer. The
British public forgave Kitchener and the murders
of the Boer children, but the story of the milk-
bowl and the flogged woman followed Stanley to
the grave.
The Tokio correspondent of Melb. Age
sent along a ridiculous little yarn about a patriotic
Jap woman who saved her country from “humili-
ating defeat ” by betraying her traitorous husband
to the police. The traitorous spouse was a mili-
tary person, and one day he came to his wife with
£40,000, which he “poured into her lap, as it
were,” stating that it was the Russian price for the
whole Jap plan of campaign which he had sold to
the foe. He told her all about the shameful trans-
action whilst their two children sat at his knee
playing with the heap of notes and silver
which had fallen from her lap. (Apparently
the Russians had paid part of the £40,000
in sixpences.) Then she rushed out of the
house down to the nearest police box and gave
the story away, whereupon the police rushed back
home with her and found the traitor lying dead,
slain by his own guilty hand, beside his ill-gotten
wealth, and the two children, presumably, were
toddling round pa’s remains. A moment later the
little ones were orphaned. Their mother had also
committed suicide in an adjoining room. The
Jap military authorities set about the preparation
of a new plan of campaign, different from the one
the traitorous officer had sold for £40,000, and
that’s how the Russians came to make such a bad
start in the war. They worked to circumvent the
cancelled arrangements, and went looking for the
foe in the wrong places. According to a certain
class of literature very current just now, every
country’s safety depends wholly on some document
or other, and if the U.S. had lost its document the
Spaniards would have burned New York and
annexed Philadelphia, and if Britain’s document
had been prigged, Paul Kruger would have taken
London without resistance. After all, the Rus-
sians seemed to be on the spot every time just as
much as if they had bought the new plan instead
of the old one—but there weren’t enough of them.
“O.O.”: Concerning some old book-
sellers
In Melbourne the first and the most noteworthy was
Henry Tolman Dwight, who had his book store and stalls
on the south side of Bourke-street, next door to Mrs.
Planner’s old White Hart Hotel. Outside the door, with
a careful eye on the stalls, stood an assistant, a hook-
worm in spectacles, who called out, “ Cheap hooks,”
“ Cheap hooks,” all the live-long day. Mr. Dwight could
speak several languages, a great advantage in a second-
hand bookseller. At his death in 1872 the stock was
auctioned by order of the executors. I recollect H. T.
Dwight attending the sale of the big library of James
Smith, of the Argus. He bought largely, and his bidding
raised the prices; Dwight was the thermometer of the
sale. When complimented by auctioneer Gemmell on
the quantity, quality, and prices of his purchases, he
announced, much to the disgust of the dealers, that he
had bought for Mr. John O’Shanassy.
An early second-hand bookseller in Sydney was J. J.
Moore. Anyone looking up old pictures of Sydney will
note a long array of shelves standing up against the old
cemetery wall in George-street, the present Town Hall
site. These bookstalls were Jerry Moore’s. He did boot
repairs alongside. You could read a book while you
waited to get “ a patch on.”
Next to Jerry came “ Old Dick Lindsay,” a very old
colonist, who did not confine his trade to books. He was
the best authority on pictures, china, glass, &c., in Syd-
ney. In the fifties his place of business was in Elizabeth-
street, near the Maurice O’Oonnell Inn. Mr. Lindsay was
for years afterwards in Oastlereagh-street, about where
Angus and Robertson now vend books.
Another old Sydney bookseller was Robert W ; Skinner,
who started business in the sixties in an ancient brick
building in Pitt-street, where the Temperance Hall now
stands. Mr. Skinner had a very large stock, and was
looked upon as an expert, though he, like Jerry Moore,
was a cordwainer. When the old shop was purchased for
extensions to the Temperance Hall, Mr. Skinner moved
into Market-street. Skinner told me how he became a
bookseller. He picked up a “ Chain ” Bible somewhere, sent
it to London for sale, and got in return £125. He thought
that there must be something in old books after that, and
went in for them. He tired of bookselling, and started
business as a pawnbroker on the North Sydney heights.
Skinner knew a good deal about leather and books, but
absolutely nothing about the three-ball business, and as
a consequence he “fell in.” He then returned to the
book trade. Mr. Skinner was the first to introduce Free-
thought literature into Sydney.
Having temporarily ceased, through ill-
ness, to transact departmental business, Premier
Seddon, of Maoriland, has become Minister of
Midwifery. On May 12 he issued and telegraphed
all through the State a 2000-word pronouncement
on the birth-rate and incidental obstetric matters,
Seddon proposes to assist immigration by deliver-
ing women, when necessary, at the State expense,
by providing State dry-nurses to tend the kids
while mother goes a-washing, and by establishing
the commendable Parisian custom of putting the
superfluous baby in the public slot and so obviat-
ing future responsibility.
“ Peter ” : Re “Hardy’s” par. (B. 7/4/’O4).
A man who was carting wood m Melbourne fell
beneath the front wheel, which passed over his
chest, crushing it in and breaking his collarbone
close to the breastbone. He was taken to Melb.
hospital. The doctor reckoned he was a “ goner,”
and did not trouble to set the broken bone, but
sent for the man s wife. He is still alive, how-
ever, and can drink a “long’un” or carry a bag
of wheat with the best. But as a result of his
collarbone not haying been set, the broken end
protrudes fully an inch, and works m and out like
a piston rod with every movement of his arm.
A Newcastle (N.S.W.) man recently wrote
the local Herald from Jewhannesburg that white
men were breaking stones in the golden city at
9d. per day.

HELPING THE
SUFFERERS
It is one of the pleasantest things in con-
nection with the history of Scott’s Emulsion
that those who are cured by it —and that in-
cludes all who take it according to instructions
for throat, lung and blood troubles —are
always so happy at having been cured that
they hasten to relieve other sufferers by pass-
ing on the good news. No one can do a
greater kindness to self than to act on such
news. For Scott’s Emulsion cures by re-
moving disease. It is absolutely necessary in
the nursery if the children are to have their
fair chance for life. The nasty taste of cod
liver oil is done away with. Scott’s Emul-
sion builds up the little ones, whatever their
ailment, from the first hour of taking it. The
hypophosphites in Scott’s Emulsion give
children splendid bones and teeth! An
excellent instance of this care for others is
related in the following letter :
32 Glenview-street, Paddington,
Sydney, N.S.W., May 2oth, 1903.
Dear Sirs, —It is with great pleasure I am
able to testify to the good I have found in
Scott’s Emulsion, for my little daughter,
Lynie, aged three
years. Erom birth she
was very delicate and
suffered much from
bowel complaints, and
had no appetite for
nourishment of any
kind. A friend who
had derived great
bene fi t from your
preparation, begged
me to try Scott’s
Emulsion. The re-
sults far exceeded my
most sanguine expecta-
tions, and the child is
now thoroughly strong,
healthy, free from trouble of any kind, and a
rosy cheeked, destructive little puss. I do
not think she would have been living now,
had it been for Scott’s Emulsion. Yours
very truely,
(Mrs.) Griffin.

The Manners of the Tory.
The Tory party in Australia has always, as a last
resource, put forward—directly, or by implication
the yarn that it was something more of a gentle-
man than the other party. It might have less
knowledge, but it had at least more manners; it
knew how to behave. The claim was never
accepted by people who thought things out for
themselves. It was, obviously, only founded on
reasoning from an analogy with British conditions
—a non-existent _ analogy. In Britain the Tory
leaders are mainly recruited from the he-
reditary aristocracy, which has had nothing to
do for generations but grow manners and
cultivate style, its potatoes being grown for it
by the hereditary serfs of landlordism. The scion
of British aristocracy is either a bad boy and takes
to drink and a music-hall marriage, or a good boy
and takes to politics, wherein his “ manners ” are
near to perfection and his behavior is something
beautiful to contemplate. But in Australia the
conditions are quite dissimilar. Here the Tory
party is mainly recruited from the stock-exchange
sharps, the successful lambing-down publicans,
and the men who have imported into retail trade
the greatest amount of chicanery. Such people,
and their children and their parasites, may, and
often do acquire a veneer of culture—which sits on
them as a gaudy frill on a ham—but there
is no essential reason why, in the mat-
ter of manners, they should have any
superiority over the mass of the community ;
and there are many reasons why the opposite
should be the case. The opposite is the case.
That fact was never made clearer than by the
elitical developments of the past few months.
Victorian politics just now the pride and hope
of the Tory party—“the gentlemen’s party”—is
Thomas Bent. In Federal politics, the existence
in office of a Radical Ministry is making Tories,
who ordinarily wear some sort of veneer of man-
ners, show themselves naked of all decency.
During last week’s debate, for example, Bruce
Smith, whose sniff of superiority is one of the
weird jokes of the Commonwealth, brought up in
Parliament that miserable matter of his children’s
education. Minister Hughes had accused him of
signing the pledge of the wretched P.D.A.
sectarian organisation—a legitimate political taunt
since Smith was at the time sniffing scornfully at
the Labor pledge. Then Smith, instead of owning
up manfully, broke out
Mr. Hughes challenged me with having signed a pledge.
I challenge him to produce any pledge I signed, but I
know what he meant. This is a personal matter. It is
dragged from me. On one occasion I sent a child of mine
to a Roman Catholic Convent. Although a Protestant, I
was broad-minded enough to recognise that a child could
get a liberal education there. The child went there and
died there. I published the death of that child as taking
place at the Convent. That announcement lost me my
seat on the Federal Convention. The question was
brought up against me at the last election, and so many
Protestants doubted my attitude on the Protestant creed
that they asked me four questions.
It is a painful incident to refer to; but the refer-
ence comes from Smith. At the time of the
Federal elections he brought up this matter—
which should have been sacred and private to him-
self—on his own account. He was reported then
to have denied that he had sent any of his children
to an R.C. school. The Watchman, as late as
last week, referred to that denial: —
During his last campaign an opponent (Mr. Varney
Parkes) made an execrable attack on Mr. Bruce Smith,
and charged him with having his children educated at a
convent school. In his efforts to prove the charge Mr.
Parkes read from a letter which he led his hearers to
believe he had received from Cardinal Moran on the sub-
ject, which, if true, showed that Mr. Parkes was not
above seeking the Cardinal’s help to “ down ” an opponent.
Mr. Bruce Smith made his critics look very small, how-
ever, when he publicly announced that his children had
all been educated by private tuition at home. Mr.
Parkes has not since been heard of politically.
There were thousands of people who knew
the facts, but who refrained from correct-
ing the reported statement of Smith that
he had never sent a child to an R.C.
School, from a disinclination to go further into an
incident which cannot be associated with politics
without a feeling of disgust. Now Smith drags
the yarn into the Federal Parliament. The
Bulletin cannot imagine any Labor member
bringing the private and sacred matters of his
hearth on to the hustings in that way,
nor can this paper imagine a man who,
like Smith, professes to be an “exact philosopher”
committing himself to the unproveable statement
that the announcement of his child’s death in a
convent “ lost him his seat in the Federal Conven-
tion.” If it did the people who intended to vote
for Smith, and who are presumably doing so now
that they have recovered from the shock, are a
miserable and paltry-minded crew.
* * * *
The next Tory exhibition was from John For-
rest, whose snobbish anger at the Labor party
having won to office has kept him squealing like
an angry pig these four weeks. Forrest accused
Attorney-General Higgins of having broken away
from his friends and gone over to the camp of the
enemies:—•
He would not like to say all he had heard about the
negotiations that went on before the defeat of the Deakin
Government between Mr. Higgins and Mr. Watson" in
regard to the former’s inclusion in any Labor Government
formed.
Then Premier Watson showed that he had not
approached Higgins until two days after he had
received the Government commission, and Higgins
pointed out that he had ex-Premier Deaicin’s full
approval in joining the Watson Cabinet. Then
Forrest sourly gulped down his slander. The
third sample of Tory manners came from Mr.
Conroy. Excerpt from Sydney D.T.
Mr. Conroy quoted from the May Day Socialists’ mani-
festoes to show that they believed in the destruction of
the marriage tie and free love. Yet the Prime Minister,
when receiving a deputation of the May Day Socialists of
Melbourne, had expressed sympathy with their objects.
What sort of thing was this for the Prime Minister to
allow it to he telegraphed all over the world that he
approved of such things ?
This method of attack was as cowardly as it
was base. It will leave a black mark against
Conroy’s name so long as he remains in
politics. He knows, must know, that Premier
Watson and the present Ministry have never given
the smallest hint of holding any immoral doctrines;
that they are all clean-living and decent men;
that “the destruction of the marriage tie and free
love” have absolutely no connection with Socialism,
though some socialists may believe in them, just
as some individualists, such as Nietzche, do.
Premier Watson will have the full sympathy of
the Australian people in his retort, “no decent
person would make the statement that you do.”
The Conroy outburst was a fitting climax to the
display of general hoggishness with which the
Tory party has greeted the advent of a Radical
Ministry.

. !' Tlaresfoot ” : Oh, dear ! Harold Begbie reports an
interview with Beerbohm Tree. Tree feels his parts so.
As Marc Antony he fairly burst into tears, and all the
Roman citizens on the stage did too. What a tribute to
the actor-manager ! Tree strangely finds that when he
doesn’t cry the supers don’t cry. Williamson used to do the
sergeant in the “ Pirates of Penzance.” When he drew
forth the red bandanna, and called upon the foorce to
weep, of course it wept with him !
Orie of Beerbohm Tree’s touring companies is playing
The Merry Wives of Windsor,” with Oscar Asche as the
Falstaff. Thusfar, Asche is the only Australian-born
actor who has established himself in a highly-salaried
position. And of course he had to go abroad to do it.
Under present conditions, there is no chance of a fat
salary for the local mummer, mum he never so wisely.
An impromptu interlude of a sensational character was
sprung on a Singleton (N.S.W.) audience the other night
during the performance of “ Charley’s Aunt ” by a travel-
ling co. The second act had just concluded, when a noise
like the stampede of elephants, intermingled with yells,
gasps and vituperation, was heard behind the scenes, the
stage fixings shook and rattled, and when a side door was
finally burst open, public interest was at fever heat.
Many at this juncture began to dive frantically for out-
lets, thinking that a fire had broken out, when an excited
gentleman rushed upon the stage and requested the
assemblage to keep calm, as there was really nothing
serious going on. It was merely a disagreement between
two of the actors. Then the play was proceeded with,
the audience searching the performers eagerly for
damages.
The strange case of Mr. Bellerby, the Drouin (Vic.)
grazier, recalls to mind a humorous situation in Pinero’s
farcical comedy, “In Chancery.” Bellerby, under the
delusion that he had committed a crime and was being
tracked by detectives, wandered about for 21 days, for-
getting his movements as he went along, but not losing
knowledge of his identity. Finally his wife discovered
him at a coffee palace in Geelong. She threw her arms
round his neck, and talked domestic matters to the dazed
Bellerby until he began to lose faith in his hallucination.
Pinero’s comedy was based on the idea of a married man
being shocked by a railway accident into complete forget-
fulness of his past life. In his case also the appearance of
his wife restored him slowly to reason. She put her arms
round his neck and talked of the children, and of the
weeks that had elapsed since he left home with no lug-
gage to speak of. And then her Martha-like solicitude
expressed itself in the earnest inquiry—“ Tell me, how
did you get on your undervests ? ”

The interest for some time evinced in the Russo-Japanese War is for a time subordinate to the
interest shown in the great Federal climax permeating Australia. The proclamation of Labor as the
ruling power and its right to rule, its advancement and its possession of the Treasury Benches in the
second Australian Federal Parliament are matters of much comment in the Commonwealth to-day.
Viewed in any light,
THIS TEMPORARY TRIUMPH OF LABOR
has its significance. The foundation upon which the Commercial and Social worlds rest, the Muscle and
Brain of Men, has picked its professors and chosen its compeers to test the right to rule, to govern*
and to legislate. On all sides is the question asked, Will this temporary triumph be a permanent
one, and, if so, will it be for the people’s good?
CLEAR BRAINS and GOOD STRENGTH ARE NECESSARY.
It will be found that against opposing forces, powerful brains, and clear judgment will be necessary.
They are necessary in all ranks of life to bring success to the feet of men. And no man can be
strong in brain and mental power unless he is healthy. Without health a man joins hands with the
elements of Disease and Death. Health’s sources are undermined, mental destruction is inevitable.
Let any man who finds himself mentally, physically deteriorated, run down, lacking the
essential power necessary to success in life, and knows he is not what he ought to be at his age, call
and consult the Specialists of
The Freeman & Wallace Medical Institute,
Sydney and Melbourne,
and he will be made aware of his condition. He will be told what is the matter
with him in plain and honest terms. These Specialists are qualified by Australian
Medical boards, and by experience to treat diseases which may at all times be
considered of a most serious character.
Some men remain weak because they are too indifferent or too busy to develop
strength by systematic exercise, others inherit weakness and suffer for the short-
comings of their parents. But a far greater number drag themselves through a
life of decrepitude because they are covering up some secret drain upon the
fountains of strength. Reformations and medical treatment are their most urgent
need. We cure thousands of cases of General Debility annually.
Young Men and Middle-aged Men who know they have made a
serious mistake, and want to recover the lost ground, should lose no time in
availing themselves of a course of our invigorating treatment. We guarantee a
cure in every case undertaken.
Excesses in the past years by young men, and irregularities and excesses in
middle-aged life are the causes of poor memory, lack of ambition and manhood
so common to the men of to-day. You can be restored, but will you ?
MEDICAL QUALIFICATIONS !!—Any man consulting is under the especial care and counsel
of Dr. RICHARD WALLACE, M.D., L.R.0.P., E., L.F.P.S., E„ L.M., who is a Specialist in the
treatment of Men’s Disorders, of high intellectual order and great experience. He is registered

The reserves move in a mysterious way. The net profit

and these movements make the profit shown above. The

The directors are a modest lot who don’t take fees, so
every year they suggest that they should have the same
“ honorarium ” as they had last year ; and as the co.
always agrees, the £4OO has to be deducted from this. It
would be far better to stop this foolish, roundabout pro-
ceeding, and charge the amount up to working expenses
at once. The co: has now increased its capital to £98,642
(it formerly stood at £69,642); nevertheless it shows an
item, “ Sundry liabilities of the co., £39,799,” an increase
of £22,486 during the year. Apparently this is represented
by new vessels and gear. What the co. is paying on this
big debt isn’t shown ; but it looks very much as though it
hasn’t even now raised enough capital to carry on its busi-
ness economically.

One of the centres of the Victorian Deform
movement is in Rodney Irrigation Trust district (Kyabram
lies thereabouts) and these statements of accounts were
recently published -Valuation of land, £59,244 (the land
in the trust district is close on 300,000 acres, so the
Deformer doesn’t put any wild or hilarious price on his
property when it is being valued for taxation purposes);
rates levied, £5183 ; amount unpaid, £2h69 ; amount due
and unpaid for water supplied, £llsh. How the honest
anti-socialistic farmer does rush to pay up !

The N.Z. Loan and Mercantile Agency Co. has
practically got its Bill through in England for straighten-
ing up its affairs ; at latest, it was merely waiting for
formal assent. The co. lias been making gross profits of
over £lOO,OOO a year, but the extraordinary privileges of
preference holders have shut out all hope of dividends for
ordinary shareholders. The new scheme provides for the
issue of 20,000 ordinary shares in lieu of the 10,000 trus-
tees’ preference shares (latter have carried the right to a
£4 dividend and to 60 per cent, of the profits after the
dividend has been paid); and also for the purchase of the
trustees’ certificates at 2s. each. There are three lots of
debentures, but interest only on the Ist and 2nd has been
paid. The scheme provides for the payment of 2 per
cent, to the unpaid 3rd debenture holders for the past
five years, provided it has been earned. The total amount
available for the purpose during the past four years has
been £16,209 ; these debentures total £405,577, so that not
quite 1 per cent, per annum has been earned for the four
years after paying first and second debentures. Last year,
however, £51,213 which had previously been in suspense
was added to reserves ; whether this can be regarded as
also profit made hi the five years depends upon a number
of things not mentioned in the reports. For the past
three years there has not been enough gross profit to pay
third debenture holders, let alone dividends, si that the
number and Character of the shares hasn't mattered ;
but with better times in the wool-growing business the re-
construction will give ordinary shareholders in a concern,
which has kept a big business together through all its
troubles, a chance of something else besides misfortune.

The trading profit has been £2769, and £lO has strayed
into the reserves without explaining how it got there. Of
this profit £4Bo'was made in the first and £2289 in the
second half-year. The paid capital now is £5328 ; 12
months ago, £4215. On the mean of these amounts, the
earnings, after paying bonus (20 per cent, on commissions
paid on dairy produce), were at the rate of just under 8
per cent. The society appears to do a com-
mission business almost exclusively, its own stocks
on hand amounting to But £1166 ; while of its
funds only £550 is represented by plant and fittings—
the balance, as well as amounts due to consignors, is
mostly represented by cash balances and outstanding
accounts (£21,897). The latter item looks heavy ; whether
it really is heavy or not depends upon the size of the
turnover, \yhieh the statements do not disclose.

In the .last 10 years the sheep on the coastal
districts of N.S.W. have increased 33. percent.. Every
other district shows a loss —the table lands of 15 per
cent., Riverina and the central division 54 per cent., and
the West, 73 per cent.. The figures don’t leave it in much
doubt as to which direction settlement ought to take.

Melbourne bank managers are in a wild and
bitter funk since the blowing up of the E. S. and A. Bank’s
strong room -at the Box Hill branch. One manager
suggested that the 10 banks should subscribe £250 each and
offer a reward for the capture of the robbers who, he says,
“are not likely to produce immediate successors” that
understand the use of nitro-glycerine. A suggestion is
also made to strengthen the garrisons in the banks at
night. It is not unlikely that the bullion cellars of the
head Offices in Collins-street will be attacked by a well-
organised gang of burglars. Explosions in the vaults of a
big bank could scarcely be heard by the police who play
euchre for drinks in a snug night house.

The area of cane cultivated in Queensland dur-
ing the last five years has been as follows :
1889 .. 110,657 acres 1902 .. 85,338 acres
1900, .. 108,535 „ 1903 .. 111,516 „
1901 .. 112,031 „
It looks as if there had been a great rush to plant more
cane as soon as it was known that the influx of Kanakas
was fairly at an end.
* * * *
Obit, at Melbourne, after a painful illness extend-
ing over 14 years, the Premier Permanent Building Society.
From the time of its first seizure till week before last,
when Justice Hodges made the order finally dissolving the
institution, it brought ruin to hundreds of shareholders
and depositors, caused the premature deaths of many,
forced a few into suicide, and landed one man in gaol.
Even its final giving up of the ghost was an unsatisfactory
episode, there being' still some £1260 of liquidated assets
unapplied for, and these, of course, find their way into
the Treasury. Probably when the grass has grown over
its grave, so to speak, some stupid Tory person will point
to its awful career as the result of Socialistic legislation.
Victorian Premier Bent’s promise, early in' the
election campaign, to give the manufacture of fiv e more
locomotive engines to the Phoenix Foundry at Ballarat is
not his only pure and disinterested act in connection with
the matter. Under the existing contract between the
Government and the Phoenix Foundry the Government
has to supply the wheels for the engines. These wheels
are imported. The firm that had contracted to-supply
the wheels failed to keep faith with the Government. The
Phoenix Foundry had the bodies of three engines ready.
In order that the Foundry people should not stand out of
their money a moment the Government stripped the
wheels off an engine at Newport and sent them to
Ballarat. The body of one of the Phoenix engines was
fitted to them and brought to Newport. The wheels were
then taken off and sent back for the second Phoenix
engine and so on for the third. Then when Bent had
three mutilated engines and a set of odd wheels on his
hands he was a proud man.

“ Marat ” : The Government is not a bad land-
lord. Know one man, a tenant of a Government depart-
ment, who through sickness and misfortune has got 17
months in arrears with the rent, and they are now giving
him time to pay the back money. Imagine—just try to
imagine—an anti-Socialistic landlord and pillar of the
church letting a sick tenant get 17 months in arrears.

Victorian railway authorities intend to make
th's financial year pan out well —or “bust.” The latest
scheme for raising the wind is that of collecting all the
accumulated scraps of timber and iron of years past,
stacking them at stations and ticketing them “ For Sale.”
Hitherto much old timber has been used to prevent
scours, etc., in drains and creeks where sudden rushes of
flood waters threatened to do damage to the permanent
way. When all the old material is sold it is presumed
that new timber will be used for this purpose and charged
as “ belated repairs.”
* * * *
Victoria’s Amended Local Government Act,
of ’O3, has set the “ thrifty ” shire councils, doing some
hard swearing. Under it they are compelled to charge
interest on all overdue rates from the day the rate is
struck, and the accumulating interest becomes added to
and part of the rate without further order or action ;
also auditors must see that the interest due appears on
the council books, and enrolment for voting purposes
must be refused while either interest or principal rate
remains unpaid. This reading of the Act was given by
Justice Hood, who held that councillors, even by resolu-
tion, could not give away the assets of a municipality,
and it has greatly shocked many shire councillors.
F’rinstance, Kyneton Council has about £3OOO due of the
rate struck last December 10th ; so far only £250 has
come in. Formerly failure to pay before June 10th
merely entailed disfranchisement ; now it means that and
the addition of interest from December 10th ; and if both
rate and interest are not promptly collected the auditors
will want to know why ; also the Government will look
askance (it won’t be the Bent Government) when the
subsidy comes to be allotted.

According to all reports from North Queensland,
this year—the year when the supply of Kanakas has been
absolutely stopped—will see the biggest sugar crop on
record. Presumably this is another evidence of the ruin
of the cane industry.

A big lot of the Sydney boot manufacturing
trade is finding its way to Melbourne simply because local
manufacturers refuse to meet the ideas of customers to
even the slightest extent. The Melbourne man, following
Yankee lines, will make up the exact kind of boot a buyer
wants. In Sydney the manufacturer, spoiled by the Free-
trade system, shows his stock lines, and if these don’t suit
he will make nothing else. The result of it all is that
while the boot trade in Sydney is in a stagnant condition,
in Melbourne it is booming.

the institution whose superintendent in Melbourne, the
other day, deplored the arrival of the Labor and Demo-
cratic party (the Labor parties began to arrive in 1892) :

And, in addition, Mr. Sawers has been able to bring his
reserves from £811,335 to £1,146,951. With a few more
years of ruinous Socialistic legislation the Bank of Austra-
lasia will develop into quite a large and payable concern.

The Pinnacles, the only remaining Barrier mine
outside Broken Hill which still works on a fairly large
scale, has been floated by the Queensland Smelting Co.
into a new concern. Q.S. Co. itself consists mainly of
J. Bull, and as far as can be learned the new co. is mostly
the same J. Bull. The mine’s output has been larger
lately than for years past, and it has looked more like a
paying proposition. It is one of several Barrier properties
over which Sydney dropped its money and was finally
frozen out.
* * * *
B.H. Junction North has placed an order for a
small magnetic concentration plant similar to the one
which lately put through a test parcel of its ore. The
machine is the Ulrich, the one adopted by the Australian
Metal Co., whose engineer Ulrich is. It is a dry process,
a modification of the Metternich, which is in use at the
Sulphide Corporation’s works. The concentrates will, of
course, have to go to Germany for smelting ; so that
Germany will probably make more out of the ore than
Australia. The bonus for the encouragement of an Aus-
tralian zinc industry takes a long time to arrive.
* * * *
Another N.S.W. mine has gone to a new Eng-
lish co.—the Mitchell’s Creek, worked with great success
for years by late Glasgow millionaire Dick. Run through
the list—Cobar Gold Mines, Mt. Boppy, two-thirds of the
Broken Hill Prop., Sulphide Corporation, British Broken
Hill, the Pinnacles, Mitchell’s Creek, Lloyd’s Burraga,
Hillgrove, Dapto Smelting Works, and about half the
coal mines. What does N.S.W. hang on to—except its
debt ?
**. . *
The Kembla coal-mming disaster of 1902 taught
its lesson, and last year the butcher’s bill in the N.S.W.
coal business was lower, in proportion to mineral won,
than ever it was before, except once, many years back.
For every life lost 491,509 tons were raised ; in the Kembla
year every 57,819 tons carried the corpse of a miner. The
average bill for the past 20 years in Britain has been 5T7
per million tons ;in N.S.W., 6‘32. Last year’s, however,
was down to 2‘05. And that, by the way, is one more
very good reason why certain foolish N.S. Wales miners
should promptly leave off crying out for bigger benefits
from or reduced payments into their State-managed and
subsidised accident insurance fund ; for if the funds in
hand have been growing, it has been partly because last
year N.S.W. coal-miners had about three times more lu,ck
than usually comes their way.

Last 12 months’ work at Mt. Boppy (N.S.W.)
resulted :
Tons. Gold, oz.
Ore crushed .. .. 29,312 8540
Tailings cyanided .. 20,783 5787
Slimes 9,347 4473
This makes a total of 18,800 oz. gold, in addition to a
small quantity not cleaned up, valued together at
£79,724. Two 2s. divs. had been paid, and another of 3s.
was recommended, making a total of 35 per cent, on the
nominal capital for the year. Ore reserves, in spite of
the extraction of 29,312 tons, are reckoned at 110,000
tons, or 30,000 tons more than at the beginning of the
year.
■Jr * * ir
Mt. Boppy, the very big Bull-owned Cobar dis-
trict (N.S.W.) gold mine, about which Sydney hears com-
paratively little, made last year a net profit of £45,209 out
of a total yield of 18,800 oz. of fine gold, realising £79,723.
Thus about 11s. 6d. in the £ was profit—this after pro-
viding for depreciation. Co. paid 7s. a share in divs., and
finished the year with £19,264 in hand, though of the
year’s profit all but £395 was distributed. Plant is being
added to, and, even with 60 stamps going, it is reckoned
that two and a-half years’ stone is in sight. A very fine
property indeed. And J. Bull gets 11s. 6d. of every £it
yields. That’s the other side of “the introduction of
British capital.”

“ Waddy ” : It is time someone uttered a word
of warning to the young men who are rushing to the
mining school’at the Sydney University. They are doing
so under two false impressions: (1) that management
work is easy to get; (2) that a University degree will
make it easier. The successful students, without excep-
tion, consider they are quite equal to taking over the
management of Mt. Morgan if it was offered them. After
passing the University they have to serve three years at
practical work and pass another examination. As each
year passes more fledglings are turned out, and they
all straightway besiege the large mines for employ-
ment at practical work underground. Very few of
them are worth their salt as far as work is con-
cerned, but probably the great bulk of them will
find jobs as surveyors’ cliainmen, or probably some
may verify the rash prediction of a Broken Hill
mine manager who said they might make good ham-
mer-men. Probably 5 per cent, of them will reach posi-
tions in keeping with the preparatory stages they have
gone through. This is the true picture, but the roseate
one these embryo managers hold in front of them is a
crowd of mine directors eager to find billets for them the
instant they have grown their tail feathers. More men
are; walking about the country with managers’ certificates,
both of service and of competence, in their pockets than
are in employment, and there are probably over one hun-
dred University fledglings putting in the necessary “ three
years’ hard ” who will qualify within two years from date
only to have their hopes’of positions destroyed. The
legal profession may be overdone, but the mining profes-
sion, for inexperienced youngsters in N.S. Wales at any
rate, was swamped long ago.
* * * *
“Yarrum”: Just now a few men are getting
a njcb bit of gold on the sea-beach between Catherine Hill
Bay and Swansea —50 miles from Sydney. They are work-
ing in black sand, with which the beach is liberally
streaked to a good depth.
* * * *
Mt. Lyell (Tas.) directors mention in their
report that they have been trying to get the State to
purchase the North Lyell railway and plant “ as a matter
of public policy.” The general manager doesn’t mention
that ; he only mentions that “ the train service on the
North Mt. Lyell line is now restricted to an up-and-down
trip on a single day in the week.” As a matter of public
policy, the State is urged to buy a line where the train
runs once a week.

A. J. Peacock, ex-Premier of Vic., has been roped
in by Bewick, Moreing and Co. He is to chairman their Vic.
advisory board. If the B.M. practice elsewhere is followed,
“No outsiders need apply ” to act as colleagues. Advisory
board is “to link up Vic.” with Bullites who find the
funds that are going into deep leads. Argus says Pea-
cock has “ decided to accept the firm’s offer, and his long
connection with alluvial mining should enable him to ren-
der the industry service, by making its potentialities
known abroad.” Well, if Peacock does anything for the
industry which has done so much for him, he is not the
past number most people imagine. How he will preen up
his plumag", especially if he gets away to London !
Hoover’s blarney and Peacock’s laugh will truly be needed
if the leads don’t drain up to expectations.

W.A. Government Statist continues to treat all
gold returns as bullion worth 71s. per oz., and converts
this alleged bullion into fine gold by deducting one-sixth
from the published figures. Every big mine, bar Horse-
shoe and Boulder, publishes its returns in fine gold, while
Kalgurli and Hainault give standard gold. Ida H. gold
is worth £4 an oz. As most people know, both the gold
returns and divs. are steadily increasing, yet Govern-
ment’s official figures give this year’s gold returns as less
than last year’s, which is absurd. L.V. Consols began
publishing its returns in fine gold in July last, and most
of the other mines have done so since January. By
Government Statist’s process, W.A.’s fine gold yield for
the past four months has been understated by about
90,0000 z., worth £382,000.
* * * *
Westralian State batteries still tell a tale of
hard graft and misery. Mount Ida had one good return
in the first week of May—s 4 tons for 108 oz.—but all the
rest averaged less than half an oz. At Norseman three
crushings averaged about lOidwt., and at Mount Leonora
a 36-ton parcel from the Great Boston only panned out
lOoz. After paying for carting, crushing, &c., a man
would not net the price of a box of matches. Now and
again a fairly good crushing is recorded, but the days when
a few rich specimens would sell a mine are gone for ever—
the Government tell-tale battery is available in the most
out-of-the-way places, and the gentle art of shepherding
allegedly phenomenal shows is dying or dead. Among
other May returns from once famous has-beens are :
Maritana, 14 tons for lOJoz, ; Ironsides, 48 tons for Boz. ;
and Robinson’s (Kanowna), 841 tons for 3140 z.

Hodgkinson (N.Q.), which in the early eighties
was a goldfield of some importance, begins to make a
small name for itself as a producer of wolfram. In ’7B the
field produced over 44,00C0z. gold, but output has gradu-
ally declined until the annual output is but 5000 oz. At
Wolfram Camp, Lappa Lappa, and round Stannary Hills
and Boonmoo, several prospecting parties are meeting
with success. During April over 50 tons of wolfram were
turned out, realising just on £4500, or about £B5 per ton.
At the Lappa Lappa camp about 200 men have shaken off
the curse of Chillagoe and Mt. Garnet, and two buyers are
taking as much wolfram as is produced at up to £lOO per
ton. At Wolfram Camp the metal is being worked by
small parties. One claim worked by four men turned
out a couple of tons which realised £lOO per ton.

Charters Towers (Q.) people are watching the
result of the change in management of Brilliant Extended.
W. A. MacLeod, until recently director of the local School
of Mines, has charge now, and if he does not at least
double the divs., then technical knowledge must never be
mentioned again to a Towers man. MacLeod, therefore,
has a hard task. It is in the economic treatment of ores,
rather than in their winning, that Charters Towers results
can be vastly improved.

A man writes from Port Darwin: “A late
mining sensation in the N.T. is a tin show across the
harbor at Port Darwin, a couple of hours pull to the
south-west of Palmerston. Tin begins at the edge of the
harbor and works back, probably right through Bynoe
Harbor (an old tin and wolfram field) to Daly River.
Hundreds of miles of country there are well worth pro-
specting. New find was stuuibled on by blacks, who gave
the show to Chinese. With the dish alone the Chinese
took some thousands of pounds of nearly pure tin from a
few yards of ground in three months, and are still getting
it good. Small rush set in, and a big field may develop.
Mines Inspector Parkes spoke of it years ago as country
that should support hundreds of white men with dish
alone. Territory people in their good old casual way have
mostly let it slide, though a few whites have now pegged
out claims and are working alluvial. Lode formation is
loose rubble of mica and quartz, with cubes of pure tin
through it.”
* * * v
Newest Northern Territory gold discovery,
Tanamai, is away out on the fringe of the desert, 60 miles
from the W.A. border, and 500 miles or so from nearest
port. Country hopeless-looking for timber ; mostly spini-
fex and turpentine bush, and only rock-holes for water.
Plenty of reefs about, testing 10 to 30dwt. Just now it
would require nearly that much in ounces to pay.
Prospectors may tackle it again when it’s been lost for 40
years.
* * * »
Northern Territory is edging up to a move in
copper. Companies at Yam Creek (great gold country in
the old days) have smelters all ready to start work on
prime stuff when the country is sound enough to get in
fuel. Wet season just over was wettest and longest for
many years, throwing all country work behind. Boss at
Yam Creek going in for mixed labor. Sortie Cobar men
have just arrived, and Italians are also getting a trial in
preference to Asiatics.

The life of the average butter-factory manager
is not too pleasant. The cookies who run the co-op.
factory consider a salary of £1 Iss. to £2 ss. per week
ample for a manager, who must have fair education, gopd
knowledge of engineering, butter-making, cream and
milk' testing, refrigerating, tinsmithing, fitting, book-
keeping, and a dozen other things. Also the manager
must not on any consideration lose his temper when some
addle-pated client comes fooling around, and must be
pleasant with all the suppliers. He has to work seven
days a week, and very rarely, if ever, gets a holiday.
Writer has been managing’ one such factory for years, and
never yet has been asked to take a holiday—not even’ a
no-pay one.

Encouragement is being given to the cultivation
of flax—a Maoriland industry—up Gippsland way, where
a factory is now at work, two miles from Stratford. The
firm running the new concern offers to buy, for a start,
300 acres grown by local farmers, if the seed, 601 b. or
701 b. to the acre, is sown on fairly clean land ; the crop to
be reaper and binder cut, when ripe, about 3in. from the
ground. The price for a crop of flax properly handled,
averaging 10 bushels of seed per acre, 2ft. to 3ft. high,, is
£4 per acre ; 2ft. 6in. to 3ft. 6in. high, £5 per acre, de-
livered at factory. When the seed (which is the main
product required just now) is lost 10s. per Cwt. is given
for the fibre, equal to £2 10s. per acre. The yield on a
local farm during the past three years was 10 bushels of
seed per acre, some paddocks giving as high as 15 bushels ■;
the average yield of fibre being 4£ cwt. up to 6 cwt. pel-
acre. The seed is always worth £l2 a ton, and Gipps-
landers feel confident of being able to manufacture linseed
oil equal to the imported, thus adding another to our list
of local manufactures.

“So you disbelieve it,” remarked the lawyer,
sarcastically. ‘‘ I do, ” asserted the witness. ‘‘ Do
you believe what you see ? ” inquired the lawyer.
“ Not always,” said the witness, “ for I am subject
to biliousness.” The witness was right and the
judge supported him. Biliousness plays havoc
with one’s powers ; it will cause the sight to be-
come blurred and give to all things a yellow tinge.
It is caused by failure to digest food, and is
generally accompanied by headache and sickness.
Its certain cure is Mother Seigel’s Syrup. Among
the thousands of people who know this from
personal experience is Mrs. Susan Dean, of Lue-
street, Rylstone, N.S.W. “ Indigestion and
biliousness caused me intense suffering,” writes
Mrs. Dean. “At much expense, I tried every-
thing I could hear of for its cure ; but nothing did
me the least good until I resorted to Mother
Seigel’s Syrup. Five bottles of that remedy cured
me entirely.”*

THE HEANING OF THE TERM—
“GOLD-FILLED.”
people correctly understand the meaning of the term “Gold-filled ” as
hHI applied to our watch cases. Some seem to regard “ Gold-filled as a
JL form of electro-plating—from which it is entirely different. Gold-filled
Watch Cases are intended as a substitute for solid gold, not only in
appearance, but in wear. A Solid Gold Watch Case is valued for its beauty—
for the gold look about it. The beauty and the gold-look are entirely on the
surface. The gold hidden away in the thickness of the case adds nothing
to its beauty, but does add greatly to its cost. To make a gold-filled
watch case an ingot of metal is placed between two ingots of solid 14-carat
gold, and the three are then rolled flat, forming a solid sheet with a thick out-
side of solid gold and a centre of metal This centre adds strength and lessens
cost, but its presence cannot be detected unless the gold is cut away. It will
be seen that gold-filled has nothing in common with gilding or plating; the
former implying a substantial layer of solid gold, the latter meaning gold
deposited on the base metal article after it is made. Men who cannot afford to
buy a solid gold watch, and men who can afford to, but do not care to run the
risk of losing such a valuable article, are recommended to consider the advan-
tages attached to buying one of these Gold-filled Watches.

BLOOD-PURIFYING REMEDY.
AN EMINENT PHYSICIAN,
Professor of Clinical Medical Diseases of
.Children and Hygiene, Marion-Sims
College of Medicine, and College of
Physicians and Surgeons, writing on
April 3rd, said :
“The great surgeon, Professor Lawson
Tait, M.D , himself a sufferer from a gouty
diathesis, was not only one of the world’s
greatest surgeons, but an able physician and
a skilful therapeutist. Por years he found
Kutnow’s Powder of great value to him
personally and in his practice, and this
remedy is one of the few he conspicuously
endorsed over his own signature. He
realised, as all careful, observing practition-
ers do, that it is necessary to cleanse the
system frequently, to remove the debris left
by undigested food, and to hasten the
elimination of uric acid to properly guard
against serious disease.
“ Kutnow’s Powder stimulates the activi-
ties of the bowels and kidneys. A dessert-
spoonful in a tumblerful of water, taken
immediately on rising in the morning,
cleans out the bowels, dilutes the* urine,
and flushes out the kidneys in a most satis-
factory way. Thorough elimination is
salvation, and there is no better eliminator
than Kutnow’s Powder.
“I. N. LOVE, M.D.”
STRIKING TESTIMONY.
A COLONEL IN THE ARMY writes :
“Pegu Club, Rangoon, India.
“I have made the acquaintance of your excellent Kutnow’s
Powder, through Mr. Guthrie, of the Medical Hall here, and I con-
sider it most efficacious. —Yours faithfully,
“E. LAWFORD,

“My people have tried Kutnow’s Powder sent us with excellent
results. Please therefore send by return another bottle and oblige.
Your Powder does what is professed for it.—Yours very sincerely,
“Captain REGINALD T. SHUTTE.”
A NAVAL CHAPLAIN writes :
“ I beg to state that I have been much pleased with Kutnow’s
Powder, and have ordered another bottle from the local chemist,
which I hope will benefit me, suffering as I do from Uric Acid in the
blood. “S. A. SHONE, Chaplain R.N.,
“Forton Barracks, Gosport.”
SIR JOHN MONCKTON wrote:
“Guildhall, London, E.C.
“Gentlemen, —I have much satisfaction in stating that for the
last two years I have regularly used Kutnow’s Powder, with the
result that troublesome and frequent attacks of Lumbago, with other
gouty symptoms that had troubled me for years, seem to have
entirely disappeared.—Yours truly,
“JOHN B. MONCKTON,
“Late Town Clerk of London.”
ERADICATES STUBBORN
DISEASES.
The extraordinary complicated diseases
resulting from neglect of precautionary
measures pass the wit of man. It is not
the business of Kutnow’s Powder to claim
that it can cure all the ills of mankind, from
Housemaid’s Knee to Impecuniosity. One
solid, incontestable fact, however, remains
in the world-wide testimony of sufferers
from painful and distressing derangements,
viz., that Kutnow’s Powder not only pre-
vents disease by its marvellous cleansing
properties, but absolutely eradicates
diseases that have become stubborn through
neglect. If in robust health take Kutnow’s
Powder on rising, and you need never be
illif ill, depi'essed, irritable, languid, or
sleepless, take Kutnow, and the trouble
quickly vanishes ; the blood is purified, the
heart beats more vigorously, the liver
quickens into action, and the kidneys are
regulated into increased efficiency. Thus
does the man become himself again, lives,
breathes, and enjoys his being, eats well,
sleeps well, and works well.

Mr. W. G. Hearne.—Dear Sir,—l am writing to tell you
about the wonderful cure your medicine has effected in
my case. About three years ago I began to cough. At
first the cough was not severe, but it gradually got worse,
and I became very weak and troubled with night sweats,
pain in my chest, and great quantities of phlegm. On
several occasions there was blood in the expectorated
matter. I had been treated by a doctor, who pronounced
my case to be Consumption, and various other treatments
had been tried, but without benefit. It was at this stage
that I heard of your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for
a course of the medicine. When it arrived I was too ill to
leave my bed, but I commenced taking it at onoe, and
gradually improved. lam glad to say that the two lots
of medicine you sent have effected a complete cure, for
which accept my very best thanks.—Yours gratefully,

with cough, for five years, and during that time got
treatment from different sources, but derived no benefit
until I used your Bronchitis Cure, which gave me relief

BRONCHITIS CURE.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —Kindly forward me a
small bottle of your Bronchitis Cure as soon as possible
asl cannot speak above a whisper, owing to a cold. I
had a bottle from you before for my little girl when she
was seven months old. She had been suffering from
bronchitis from her birth, and now she is 3 years old, and
has not had a return of it since. It is a splendid medi-
cin for bronchitis or colds of any sore.

“ Mr. Hearne.—
“ Dear Sir,—l am very much pleased with the effects
of j our Bronchitis Cure. Last winter three of my chil-
dren had very bad coughs, and one bottle cured the
three of them. The housemaid also had such a severe
cold that she entirely lost her voice, but half a bottle
cured her.. I always keep it in the house now, and re-
commend it to anyone requiring a medicine of that kind.
“ I now want you to send at once four bottles to Eng-
land to my mother, who is suffering greatly from bron-
chitis. The address is enclosed.

“Mr. W. G. Hearne, Geelong.—
“ Dear Sir, —
Your letter and Bronchitis'Cure to hand quite safe.
lam sure you will be glad to know that your Bronchitis
Cure has,quite cured me. I was very glad when it came
as I was suffering from a severe attack of Bronchitis at the
time it arrived. I had sent for my own doctor, but had
not had one night’s rest for a week. I started taking the
Bronchitis Cure three times a day as directed, and was
very much eased at once. At the end of a week I only
took it twice a day, and then only' every night for a
week, as I was so much better when, thanks to the Lord
for adding His blessing, I was quite well, and walked into
town and back without feeling any fatigue. I had not
done that previously for 12 months—ulways went in the
omnibus as walking caused me such pain and distri ss in
the chest. I always walk now', and never feel it, and I
am stronger than I have been for years. I thank my son
for his great kindness in sending the medicine, and am,
dear Sir,

Extract from a letter, since written by the same lady to
her son, Mr. John S. Mortimer, Llenwellyn,
Victoria. °
HER DAUGHTER HAD BEEN VERY ILL.
SPITTING UP BLOOD.
THE DOCTOR SAID NOTHING MORE COULD BE
DONE.
CURED BY HEARNE S BRONCHITIS CURE.
The extract runs as follows:—“As for myself, thank
the Lord, lam feeling stronger than I have for years. I
had an attack of Bronchitis in November, but Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure was again successful. I feel quite well,
and walk into town feeling quite strong.
“ I must ask you to send me six bottles more of the
medicine, as I wish to have a supply in the house. I
have tried to get it made up here, and let my chemist
have a bottle to see what he could do. He tells me this
week he can make nothing out of it, he never saw any-
thing like it before, so there is only one thing for me to
do—send for more. I have never kept in bed one day
since I commenced to take it. I used to be in bed a fort-
night at a time always, and after that for months I was
as weak as I could possibly be, and was always taking
cod liver oil, so you will see at once it is quite worth
while sending for it such a long distance.
“ Something more I must tell you. Charlotte has been
very ill since I wrote you. Her cough was so bad she
never had a night's rest, and was spitting up blood
very much. The doctor told her husband that there was
nothing more he could do for her. So on the Sunday I
sent her half a bottle of the Bronchitis Cure, and told
her to try it, and if she did not use it, not to waste it,
but send it back again. She had such confidence in her
doctor that I thought she would not try it. On the
Wednesday I sent over again, and she was much better,
the night’s rest was very good, and cough and bleedin"
from the lungs better. She sent for another half-bottle,
and on the following Sunday sent over to say that she
was quite cured and did net require any more medicine.
So you see what great good it has done, and she wishe3
to have some of my next supply.”

DISTRESSING, SUFFOCATING, DRY COUGH
ENTIRELY REMOVED BY FIVE DOSES.
NO OTHER TREATMENT COULD EVEN EASE IT.
“Sir.—My wife was for twelve years a sufferer from
a most distressing, suffocating, dry cough that could not
be removed or even eased by any remedy, doctors’
prescriptions and patent medicines having been tried-
but I am happy to say that the cough, pain in the chest’
and difficulty of breathing, etc., were entirely removed by
the fifth dose of your Bronchitis Cure.—l remain Sir

pleased with the results of your wonderful medicine, as a

for five years, and now I do not feel safe to be without?

EXPECTORATING BLOOD AND MATTER.
COMPLETELY CURED.
“ Mr. W. G. Hearne.
“ Dear Sir,—Your medicine has cured me of bronchitis
and asthma, from which I suffered for upwards of seven
years, during which period I was scarcely ever free from
coughs, and frequently the difficulty of breathing was so
distressing that for nights in succession I had to” sit up
I write you this acknowledgment from a sense of duty as
in my case every other treatment had failed. For a year
previous I had been getting very much worse, and at the
time I obtained your medicine I was confined to bed
suffering from a most violent cough, expectorating blood
and matter, and apparently beyond hope of reoovery
lhe first dose of the medicine gave me welcome relief
and I steadily improved as I continued the treatment’
until I became, as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely,'

The Old Coolgardie Road.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A FLITTING shadow follows
The rushing night express;
Dawn shades the eastern hollows
And wakes the wilderness.
And there across the valley
One fleeting moment showed,
Between the clump of mallee,
The old Ooolgardie road !
No clouds of dust betoken
The old-time roaring days ;
It keeps a peace unbroken
Throughout its winding ways.
But when at noontide hour
The warm white sunlight streams
Through crimson gums in flower,
The old road lives in dreams.
Once more the dawn is lifting,
One cold white star looks down,
l’he dawn-fire smoke goes drifting
To blur the boulder brown ;
A sleepy song comes creeping,
Faint horsebells break our rest;
And, lo ! the day is sweeping
Night’s shadow to the west !
Across the rise come striving—
Their ponies’ feet a-spin—
The shouting blackboys driving
The headlong brumbies in.
Ho ! sling the packbags over !
Ho ! mind the stallion’s heels !
The dim road calls the rover,
And swift the daylight steals.
With many a swamper’s swag on,
And many a billy black,
The sandalwooding waggon
Creaks off along the track.
With rusty chains a-j ingle,
And swingle-bars a-row,
In sturdy file and single,
The Northam scrubbers go.
See how they strain at leaving !
Their metalled harness gleams
On splendid shoulders heaving,
The crack Victorian teams !
No more with wool-bales weighted
They’ll cross the border runs,
They travel, costlier-freighted,
Beneath Westralian suns !
Foam flakes the leaders hardy,
Sweat clots the reeking four—
This morning in Ooolgardie
Some seasoned heads are sore ;
Last night some cheques were breaking,
Too big to feel the loss —
The Hill End boys are making
A record to the Cross.
And Castieau’s raking roanies
Could give their dust to most,
What though the Bayley ponies
Were headed for the coast!
And though from past Goongarrie,
Where crusted salt lakes blaze,
Bound westwards, like old Harry,
Come Northmore’s rushing bays !
Clear lined against the sunlight,
Their saddles all a-sway,
With loads that seldom run light
The camels pick their way.
While down the stony pass here
The lusty horsemen ride
To water and green grass here
Along Boorabbin’s side !
How the swift seasons leap on !
’Tis barely twelve years back
Since Henning drove his sheep o.i
Hunt’s winding waggon track.
He gives his Baris lady
Gems that are fair to see—
Has he forgot the shady
Noon spells on Karalee ?
To some, wealth past all dreaming,
To some, the nameless grave ;
To some, for their redeeming
Your careless gold you gave.
The countless feet that wore you
With cursing and with mirth,
No more will travel o’er you ;
They tread the ends of earth.
The brown grass waves its tassels
Where once your ruts ran deep,
And where we built our castles
The wild-vine tendrils creep.
No more our wheels will wake you,
Old road, you wait in vain ;
The desert soon will take you
Back to her breast again !

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE average Australian detective, after a few
years’ service, develops handcuffs on the
brain and tongue, for he carries enough
“copy” in his head to make the fortune of an up-
to-date novelist. The trade of man-hunting
breeds a class which soon develops definite charac-
teristics. In one you will see the big-necked,
shiny-eyed sleuth, padding, tiger-like, through
the dark byways, crouching in the shadow of a
lamp or coffee-stall, searching the face of each
passing citizen, measuring his height, his gait, to
fit him, if possible, with the description of some
“wanted” murderer, thief, or forger.
The Australian D. is not vl chiefly for his blind
E existence and reckless abi, tty to bluff. The most
rilliant detectives in the w, rld’s history attained
marvellous results by theii intellectual patience,
not by blows or the power of their feet. Com-
pared with the American or French sleuth, the
Australian is merely an ill-trained blood-hound
who exhibits an occasional desire to hammerlock
anything that comes within his grasp.
“But we’re not all man-eaters,” said one of
them to me, recently. His mouth had the twist
of a hooked mullet; his eyes, when I caught him
square-faced, turned from iron to flint. “Yes,
sir,” he continued; “and many a youngster has
profited by our advice. I tried the official force
myself for two years, but gave it up. I’m in the
shadow-line now, and it pays. I chase the missing
friend, and the long, pale man who habitually
loses his block and the number of his house. I
came from N’Yorlt in the ’fifties ; being young, I
was ready to clue down a lost suburb or track a
missing whale to the icebergs.”
Shadow and myself are not strangers ; his office
adjoins mine, and there are times when he looks
in to apologise for the multitude of hairy men and
gaunt women who call at his “missing friends”
bureau and refuse to be comforted when Shadow
keeps them waiting in the passage.
Turning from me for a moment, he pigeon-holed
a dozen letters in his roll-top desk, wolfed a blade
cigar with his teeth, then allowed his left hand to
caress his short neck like one awakened from a
pleasant dream of the hangman.
“I guess,” he said, somewhat hoarsely, “I’ve
met the cream and the scum of this land—miners,
Murray-cod fishers, squatters, harpies and pimps ;
and don’t you forget that I’ve dined with the
Governor —he’d lost more than his front teeth when
he consulted me. But that’s neither here nor
there. I liked the old-time miners best —good old
Bill and Jack, who’d made their pile suddenly and
wanted to find some mate or some kiddy they used
to play with. They rarely hankered after fine
clothes or women; they just plugged round the
slums with a fist full of coin, asking for ‘me old
mate, Joe Smith of Eureka,’ and when Joe didn’t
roll out of the first pub or the grave, they con-
sulted me.
“There was Buckley M‘Bean, the blackmailer,
bred on the Sydney Rocks, and suckled by a con-
vict woman. His playmates were the children
of mutineers and cut-throats. The instinct of
blackmailing ran in his blood. He was an actor, a
genius, a trawler of mugs. His business was to
unt up an affluent young man of dubious parentage
and prove, hook or by crook, that he was the
young man’s long-lost father. Buckley in his later
days resembled a long spider in an overcoat, his
thin arms seemed lost in the wide, black sleeves.
He lived mostly on biscuits and convict-still
brandy—the Black Dog brand which had a hun-
dred lashes in every pint. His face grew like an
aged baboon’s; there was hair in his ears like
small bird’s nests; when he breathed on you or
touched your hand you felt that the vampire of
your dreams was about to settle on your neck.
Buckley never was good-looking. I guess his face
would have given an Indian monkey-temple the
shivers. And when he settled upon the affluent
young man, the youngster, in nine cases out of ten,
would get rattled, and the sight of Buckley’s
horrible face would make him eager to buy large
quantities of silence. Seven rich young men, to
my knowledge, refused to have him for a father.
But Buckley vampired them so skilfully that you
could hear their bankers breathing between the
seven hushes.
“ In the seventies there li\ ed in Melbourne a
young swell known as the Prince. He was a
gorgeous young man, and a frequent visitor to
Government House. Somehow it leaked out that
he had been adopted in infancy by a wealthy
spinster, who died, leaving him the bulk of her
fortune. Buckley M‘Bean shepherded the Prince
for two years, woi k ing up his case until he knew
his quarry tooth and nail. He discovered the
orphan asylum v . ore the Prince had begun life,
he tracked down a woman who had known the
Prince’s mother, and thereafter, my friend, he
played his hand with some big truths for trumps.
And Buckley came down like a wolf on the gold.
“It was at a garden party. A valet rushed
towards the Prince and whispered that the father
of all the monkeys in the world was waiting for
him in the drawing-room. It appears that the
Prince was in the act of proposing to the daughter
of a leading medico. Some men know the exact
moment to hit the iron ; Buckley got in his thud
when it was at about red heat. When the Prince
dashed into the drawing-room he was still holding
the lady’s fan. Buckley was crouching in a low
chair, breathing Black Dog brandy through the
family album. Before the Prince could speak,
Buckley was up, with his finger pointing to a
chair. ‘Sit down, Henry,’he said, frostily, ‘and
order your damned flunkeys to shut the doors
tight.’ Then he shook his horrible rags at the
boy, unbuttoned his coat and revealed his shirtless
bosom. The Prince retreated, but the old black-
mailer followed him into a corner, and whispered
five savage words that took the Prince by the
knees and throat. Then Buckley lit his clay pipe
and smoked with his face to a mirror.
“In story-books, my son, it is usual in such
situations for the Prince to reply with blighting
epigrams, but the Prince of Melbourne began
running round the room like a frightened rabbit
until the footstool tripped him. Buckley watched
him grimly. ‘ You are as excitable as your
mother,’ he said, ‘ but you will never love me as
she did.’
“The stench of his tobacco drove the inquisi-
tive flunkeys into the passage. The Prince lay on
the floor, and they said he squealed like a child.
Guess it cuts the heartstrings when an old papa
gorilla walks into your affairs and demands un-
limited affection ? And the old blackmailer had
hypnotised himself into believing that he really
was the father of the Prince. Three months
afterward Buckley took a trip to England with a
big cheque in his pocket; but for twelve weeks
the Prince had lived in a kind of home-made
Gehenna'with Satan Buckley dogging him night
and day.
“That happened years ago, my son. Buckley
is still in Sydney, looking for his real son this
time. It appears that the old vampire was once
the father of three sons. One of them, a nipper
of four, he left with some people in the country
nearly 30 years ago. The kid grew up and deve-
loped surprising business instincts, and within the
last two years he has potted big sums. Now,
when you’re old and poor and your son is rich and
smart, he usually plays the part of the great
African desert. You start out to find him, and
he dries you up bones and all. As soon as
Buckley gets a clue concerning his son it vanishes.
The son is too clever; he buys up the information
right under the old vampire’s nose. Buckley came
to me last week, and you might have drowned a
pup in his tears. He is like a hungry castaway
trying to climb aboard a beautiful house-boat ;
every time he gets a foot on the step an invisible
person with a long pole shoves him off. Up to
date the old blackmailer is marking time on hot
firebars. I’ll introduce you to him some day.”
Taking one of Shadow’s palest cigars, I passed
from the office into the corridor. Quitting the
lift at the basement, I walked leisurely towards
the post-office. A thin, black shape slipped
ahead of me, and as it halted in the lamp-shadow
I felt its eyes settle upon me like two drops of
cold water. I entered a cafe where there was
wine and good cheer, but the following night and
the night after I saw the shape again, felt the
two drops of cold water as I passed the lamp. I
am visiting Bouringa station on the Darling next
week. I shall take with me a gun which my
father used for shooting tigers m Bengal.

YOU CAN BE CURED.
You may have been suffering even for years from
Rheumatism

Ansemia
Blood Disorders
Biliousness
Jaundice
Gravel
Stone
Bladder Troubles
General Debility
Sick Headache
and you will continue to suffer unless the disorder is treated, as it ought to be treated, by striking
direct at the cause. All the disorders mentioned are due to one cause and one cause alone ; namely
the disability of the
KIDNEYS AND LIVED
to perform the work allotted to them in Nature’s Scheme. Nature will tolerate no irregularity.
When the kidneys and liver are working perfectly, it is impossible for anyone to suffer from any
of the disorders named. In order that this important fact may. be realised, the following d<&cription
of the work performed by those vital organs is given :
The ICidneys filter and extract from the blood about three pints of urine every day. In this
quantity of urine are dissolved about an ounce @f urea, ten to twelve grains in weight of uric acid,
together with other animal and mineral matter varying from a third of an ounce to nearly an ounce.
When the kidneys are in health, all this solid matter is in solution and is invisible. Directly the
kidneys, through either weakness or disease, become unfit to do their duty properly, a proportion of
the solid matter remains in the blood, becomes actively poisonous and causes us to suffer from uric
disorders such as Rheumatism, Gout, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Backache, Sciatica, Gravel.
Stone, Bladder Troubles, and Bright’s Disease. A simple test to make as to the condition
of the kidneys is to place some urine, passed the first thing in the morning, in a covered glass, and
let it stand until next morning. If it is then cloudy, or there is a brick-dust like sediment, or if
particles float about in it, dr it is of an unnatural color, the kidneys are not healthy, and no time must
be lost in adopting remedial measures, or Bright’s Disease, Diabetes, or some less serious but more
painful illness will result.
The Liver. —In the liver various substances are actually made from the blood. Two or three
pounds of bile are thus made from the blood every day. The liver takes sugar from the blood,
converts.it into another form, and stores it up so as to be able to again supply it to the blood,
gradually, as the latter requires enrichment. The liver changes uric acid, which is insoluble, into
urea, which is completely soluble, and the liver also deals with iilood corpuscles which have lived their
life and are useful no longer. When the liver is inactive or diseased we suffer from Indigestion,
Biliousness, Anaemia, Sick Headache and Blood Disorders.
The health of the liver and of the kidneys is so closely connected that it is almost impossible for
the kidneys to be affected, and the liver to remain healthy, or vice versa.
It is nearly thirty years since scientific research, directed specially to diseases of the Kidneys
and Liver, was rewarded by the discovery of the medicine now known throughout the world as
Warner’s Safe Cure. It was realised, at the outset of the investigation, that it was necessary
to find a curative agent which would act equally upon the kidneys and upon the liver, these
organs being so immediately associated in the work of dealing with the body’s waste material, and,
after many disappointments, the medicine which possessed the required action in the fullest
degree was at length discovered. Warner’s Safe Cura cures all diseases of the kidneys
and liver, and, by restoring their activity, these vital organs are enabled to rid the body, through
the natural channels, of the urinary and biliary poisons, the presence of which in the system, are the
eause of Rheumatism, Grout, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Backache, Sciatica, Blood Disorders, Anaemia,
Indigestion, Biliousness, Jaundice, Sick Headache, Gravel, Stone, Bladder Troubles, and Genera]
Debility. Warner’s Sate Cure cures all these disorders simply by removing the cause of the disordei.
This is the reason why cures effected by Warner’s Safe Cure are permanent cures.

Hesperus House.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MOST people find a pathetic pleasure in re-
visiting the scenes that were familiar to
them in earlier years. The house they
boarded in, the shop in which they bought their
tobacco, the hotel wherein they drank their rum-
and-milk in the cool, fresh, blue morning, are sur-
rounded by an aura of romance. These places
may look dingy and commonplace to the ordinary
eye, but they are not so, and never can be so, to
the man who dwelt in the midst of them in the
good days when he was young.
* * * *
I passed by Hesperus House the other dav. It
has aged visibly, aed lost caste, but is still a sub-
stantial building. The brownstone front is not so
high-toned in appeal ance as it used to be; the
bell-pull and the door-knob are not so brightly
polished ; the scroll-work railing of the balcony
looks as if it were coated with soot ; the doorstep
is almost worn down to its setting, like an old
tooth, and is not as clean as it was—but they all
are the same in substance as in the old years that
the locust hath eaten. I saw once more the lady
with the dark, sweet face, and eyes like Monna
Lisa standing on the balcony and taking her last
look at the sun setting over the roofs and
spires of Sydney. She was a bride, and
died a year afterwards on a station in
the desert somewhere at the back of Wilcannia.
I saw the Orange-haired Lady and the Friend of
Pinero, and the German High Transparency and
his Tutor, and other aristocratic and fascinating
shades. It is pleasant, if a little sad, to have pic-
tures like this to look back upon as one grows
older and the light begins to fade.
* » * *
Hesperus House was not a boarding establish-
ment of the ordinary vulgar type in which ordi-
nary vulgar people sleep and eat. It was a
refined Home wherein the graces and decencies of
life were observed and practised—not without
effort, at times, on the part of some of the
boarders. The Lady of the House knew all that was
worth knowing about the manners and customs of
the Best Society. When I became better ac-
quainted with her she informed me that
many well-to-do but ill-informed people from
the country came to stay with her for
a few weeks as a sort of preparation before they
took a trip to Europe. She spoke the truth. I
met some of them afterwards. Hesperus House
was, in fact—as I also discovered subsequently—
not so much a boarding-house as an Academy of
Social Culture. Its table manners were a good
deal better than its table. The Lady herself I
suspected to be the relict of a Butler who had,
while alive, enjoyed the privilege of waiting upon
the British Aristocracy in the days when the B.A.
took itself seriously, and did not go on the Stock
Exchange and carry the Wild Cat round by the
tail and offer it to possible purchasers. She
dressed in stiff black silk, and looked like a
dowager Duchess, but no Duchess was ever so
grand and stately. The table she kept was a com-
bination of aestheticism and austerity. There was
more silver filigree and fine linen than substantial
food to be seen upon it. Yet, even if you had
the courage, you had not the heart to mention the
fact in her presence. The Friend of Pinero,
greatly daring, made a sarcastic allusion to the
age of the turkey, or the quality of the mutton,
upon one occasion when he and she were by them-
selves.
“ She looked at me as Mary Queen of Scots
might have looked at the headsman—in a proud,
mournful, resigned sort of way, you know,” lie
said to me afterwards, “ and I felt like a ruffian.
Anyhow, I apologised and said I supposed my
palate, or stomach, or something must be out of
order. And I’m d—-—d if she didn’t go into her
bedroom and bring me a box of antibilious pills ! ”
* * * *
Personally I cared little for the lack of expen-
sive viands. I was ever one who preferred plain
butter on a lordly dish to clotted cream in a com-
mon bowl. The sparkling glassware, the da,ma.sk
napery, white as the snow of Kosciusko, the cups
and saucers of delicate china, elegant of shape and
quaint of pattern, the flowers—there were always
flowers on the table—and the high-bred way in
which we used to ask each other to pass the salt
or the mustard, transformed a poor meal into a
social poem. We were not . all of us intellectual,
but nearly all of us were refined, or trying to be
refined, and could appreciate refinement when we
saw it. The Friend of Pinero and myself fre-
quently went out, after meals, and ate oysters or
corned beef. We agreed, however, that the com-
pensations of Hesperus House made up for its
deficiencies.
* * * *
I remember, with a smile and a sigh, what first
caused me to take up my quarters in Hesperus
House. I was in love at the time. She was a
radiant being from a fairer star. I wrote her
verses to that effect, and she pasted them in her
album. She was my superior in all ways. Her
people were also of a superior class, and kept two
pianos in their house—one upstairs and one down-
stairs. I felt that if I wished to win her I must
strive my utmost to struggle up to her level. She
was an angel, but, by virtue of her sex, only a
girl, yet she seemed to appreciate and encourage
my efforts to make myself worthy of her. I deter-
mined, for her sake, to throw aside all coarse and
common pleasures, and eschew unrefined, though
agreeable, company. I advised her of this resolu-
tion in various sonnets and ballads. Some of
them were published and paid-for, and I spent the
money on flowers, which I sent her packed in card-
board boxes, and in other ways. For one poem I
wrote about her I got money enough to buy a
cockatoo that bit a piece out of my finger while I
was trying to teach it to repeat her name, which
was Ermyntrude. I was aware, however, that, in
addition to spiritual improvements, it was desir-
able for me to acquire some social polish in a quiet
and inexpensive way. At that moment somebody
told me about Hesperus House.
* ♦ * *
As soon as I saw the Lady of the House, and
had some little talk with her, I knew that I had
come to the right shop for what I required. This
impression was agreeably confirmed when I went
down to dinner, and noticed the people at the
table, and heard their conversation. There was no
offensive depth in it, and no false glitter of wit A
sweet and light vivacity like the play of sunbeams
< ’ n a wet tarpaulin was its chief characteristic.
Lut 1 learnt from it the fact that there is a subtle
and almost incommunicable art in the ability to
say nothing in an attractive and satisfying
manner. I had previously lived in a boarding-
house filled with Bphemians—artists, actors
musicians, and such like. They were all good
fellows, and all more or less young and abounding
in animal spirits. I thought their candid criticism
of each other, and their unsparing badinage
charming and stimulating, until I fell in love.
Ihen I discovered that it was coarse and indeli-
c
There was nothing of the kind to be heard
n Hesperus House.
* * » *
On the top storey of the establishment there were
u° small rooms, which would be called garrets in
the Cold Country. One of these I occupied
and paid for it (with board) thirty shillings
a week. The people on the other floors paid from
two to three guineas a week. The garret next to
mine was tenanted by a tall young man—some
years older than myself, however—with a pleasant,
predatory face. We became very friendly before
long, and he told me he had gone to school with
Jrmero, and had been his friend ever since.
After I had been there a week or two, a squatter
frcun the backblocks of Queensland came with his
wife and several children to stay at Hesperus
House. They intended to stop a month in
Sydney before starting on a trip to Europe,
ihese were the sort of people I had heard about.
1 observed them taking on polish rapidly. The
Man was impossible. He ignored the subdued
intentional delicacy of the conversation at the
table, and talked in a loud, affable, uncultured
voice of the good time he intended to have when
he went to England.
1 ask y° u ’ Mr - ’’said the Lady of
the House m her three-ply silk voice, “which
place of historic interest you will visit first ? ”
‘‘Certainly, ma’am—Smithfield,” he said'.
, “ Ah, yes,” she observed piously; “Smithfield,
hallowed by the sacrifice of the martyrs.”
The man from the Never-Never looked at her
piously for a moment, and then replied, slowly,
I don’t know anything about martyrs, ma’am,
tatlmgoin’ to the Smithfield Cattle Markets.”
Ihe Lady of the House sighed and looked down
at her plate. The man’s wife gazed around in a
pathetic, puzzled way. She knew that there was
something wrong. Would nobody explain ? The
b riend of Pinero winked at me across the table.
Ihe other people kept on shimmering on a wet
tarpaulin.
But before they left, the squatter’s wife knew
many things. She was a pale, fat lady, with keen
black eyes. If she had not learnt things before,
it was because she had always lived where there
was nothing to learn that she did not already
know. Those eyes saw everything that happened
at the table. Before the family left I heard her
lecturing her husband on his want of manners.
He laughed uproariously, and at dinner that even-
lug culled her Betsy ”in front of the whole com-
pany.
“ T , here * s tlle makings of a lady in that woman,”
said the Lady of the House afterwards, “but her
husband ! ”
She lifted up her hands.
* * * *
I was doing splendidly, however, and could talk
about nothing with any of them. The great secret
Vv success t'his art is to have nothing* to talk
about. I was handicapped in this respect, as I
had Ermyntrude. She was a sacred subject. Yet
I spoke of her. One evening the lady with the
sweet dark face and the eyes like Monna Lisa was
sitting alone on the balcony. Her husband had
gone out, and she seemed very sad. I sat down
beside her and we conversed on many things. Then
sh j told me that she had lived all her life in aplace
where there were green hills and running waters,
and bright clear air—l forget whether it was Tas-
mania or Maoriland and she felt frightened
when she thought of her future home—in the
desert. But she was glad because her husband
would be always by her side—and “Love is
enough,” she said. I can see her now—tall and
young and beautiful with truth in her eyes and a
look, as she rose up and leaned over the balcony,
of the Blessed Damosel leaning from the golden
bars of heaven. Somehow I felt that there was
tragedy in the air.
As I said before, she died a year afterwards—
died giving birth to her baby.
* * * *
The Orange-haired Lady—this name was given
to her by the Friend of Pinero—was the autocrat
of the table, and led the shimmering conversation.
She was a powdered, painted woman with pale
blue eyes and a thin hard mouth. I think that in
the course of her two months’ stay in the place I
never saw her wear the same dress twice. But her
hair was the most extraordinary thing about her.
She reminded me of the Roman, ladies who used
to powder their hair with gold. I classed her at
once as an adventuress. Much I knew, and much
I had to learn. Her husband was a reserved, pale-
faced man who seemed to be suffering from some
internal complaint. Sometimes his wife would
break through the shimmering nothingness of the
conversation and talk in a really brilliant manner.
I hen I had to admit that she was a cultured
woman, and one who had thought a lot in her
time. But her husband would only smile in a
sickly way.
“Look here,” I said to the Friend of Pinero
after one of these displays, “ that unfeeling mollusc
doesn’t deserve to have such a woman for a wife
even if she is an adventuress.”
“Wait a while,” said the schoolfellow of the
Dramatist; ‘ ‘ something is going to happen one
of these days. ”
* * * *
The German Baron and his Tutor were both
excellent fellows. I have reason to believe that
the former was something more important than a
mere baron. His manners were exquisite. When
he passed you anything from his side of the table,
you felt that for such a service in his own country
there were people who would kiss his hand.
* * * *
I forgot in after years most of the elegant eti-
quette I learnt in Hesperus House. The Friend
of Pinero I have never seen or heard of since.
The Orange-haired Lady died of cancer in a
private hospital two months after she left us. She
had come to Sydney to consult some specialist as a
last resource. I hat was why her husband looked
so sad and taciturn. And I thought she was a
heartless adventuress ! God forgive us for all our
evil and thoughtless thoughts of others ! Ermyn-
trude married somebody else. The Lady of the
House disappeared suddenly—for reasons, I believe,
not unconnected with debt. And Hesperus House
is now a Government office. “ The Owl hath sung
her watch-song in the towers of Afrasiab.”
VICTOR J. DALEY.
In a certain Sydney suburban street each
side is the beat of a different policeman. One
night a bundle of rags in the shape of a woman
was lying dead drunk in the gutter on the side
patrolled by Constable A., who, when he discovered
her, lifted her and deposited her on the other side
of the street. Constable 11. soon came along, saw
the object, considered for a moment, then quietly
carried it back again for Policeman A. to run
against. This A. did when he happened that way
again, and marvelled, but carried the woman back
into B.’s beat and waited. When he saw Police-
man B. bringing her back once more he spoke
severely to B. Then 8., seeing no help for it,
started off with his burden, but half way to the
station he saw Policeman C. in the distance, and
reckoning that C. needed exercise, he dropped his
load and fled.
= FIVE YEARS OF =
Rheumatism
Which Several Doctors Fail to Cure.
"My son recommended Bile Beans:
FIVE years ago,” says Mrs. Sarah
Lawrence, of Pirie Town, Port
Pirie, S.A., “I began to suffer
from Indigestion and Rheuma-
tism. The pain first started in the small
of my back, and gradually went down into
my legs and feet. My legs would, at times,
become three times their ordinary size,
when I would be forced to neglect all my
household duties and lay up for weeks to-
gether. Whatever food I took disagreed
with me, and I also became very consti-
pated. I had two or three doctors attend-
ing; me. They prescribed medicines and
liniments, but I derived no lasting benefit.
I also tried many medicines advertised,
but never gained an atom of benefit from
any of them. Twelve months ago my son
came over to Port Pirie. While describing
my troubles to him, he advised me to
undergo a course of Bile Beans, as he knew
of a very similar case to my own where the Beans had proved eminently effective, and he
himself could speak from personal experience of their great worth. Naturally, after the
disappointing experiences I had with medicines in general I laughed at the suggestion that
Bile Beans would cure me. But in the end his confidence in their worth impressed me,
and I decided to give Bile Beans a trial. The first dose seemed to afford me great relief—
the gnawing pains left my back, also the pains in my legs. Thus encouraged I decided to
undergo a thorough course of the Beans, and took one every night for a month or so, at the
end of which time I was beginning to wonder if I was the same woman, such a marvellous
change had taken place. Three or four boxes of the Beans was all I took, and from the
first dose to the present date I have had no return of the pains. I enjoy my food, and, in
fact, may say I am in perfect health, the credit for which is entirely due to Bile Beans.”

ACHE, INDIGESTION, CONSTIPATION, PILES, DEBILIT Y, FEMALE WEAK-

When All Run Down
Unfit for Work. Run Down in Health. Due to the Climate. A
Tonic and Strengthened A Reliable Medicine.
''Sr
Mrs. D. Barbour,
Balmain, N. S. Wales,
sends the photo-
graph of herself and
husband, and says:
4 Both myself and
husband have veiy
great pleasure in
testifying tothegood
we have derived from
the use of Ayer's
Sarsaparilla. 1 be-
came run down in
health, suffering
much from indiges-
tion, and was wholly
unfit for domestic
duties. Hearing of
the value of Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla, I tried
it, and after using
only four bottles I
was completely my-
self again. Having
such confidence in
it from personal use, I confidently recommend it as a tonic and strengthener.
We consider your medicines to be most reliable, especially in Australia,
where the climate is so trying.”
Do you suffer from indigestion? Tired all the time? Unfit for work?
And easily discouraged? The trouble with you is you are being slowly
poisoned. The impurities in your blood are getting the upper hand of you.
Why not get rid of these poisons? You can easily do it with Ayer s Sarsa-
parilla. This splendid medicine purifies the blood, builds up the nerves,
and enables you to throw off that terrible feeling of depression due to a
warm climate. , ,
Do not risk any dangerous experiments. Take the old reliable Ayer s
Sarsaparilla, not some other kind. Look out for substitutes.

“N.” writes : A certain leading: actor now in Sydney
has been paying his wife a good deal of attention lately.
(The rest of the letter is libellous, so the matter ends
here.)
The brawny figure of King Iledley is strolling around
Melbourne in company with his English wife. They have
a furnished house at St. Kilda, and an income (furnished
by the wife)which is said to run into thousands a year.
And yet we tear people saying that Australian actors
don’t get along in England.
A country paper, the Burra Record, anxious to praise
a cornet player very highly, observes : “It is evident
that Blank Dash knows no bounds with the cornet—the
manner in which he handled the instrument reminds one
of a boy with a tin whistle ” ! This is praising with faint
damns.
“0.K.” : Touchingmusic and thedramain the Big Smoke,
a lately-returned Australian lady writes : ‘ ‘ There is such a
lot of inferior art which money introduces and the ig-
norant smart people patronise that a London reputation
is now of little worth.” Such complaints are only uttered
by English-speaking people whose ideas about Britain
were formed at a great distance from the ‘ mother
country.” A London reputation, as a Londoner under-
stands the term, is almost invariably an imported thing.
The artists who command enormous prices for their work
—vocal, instrumental, or otherwise —are visitors to Lon-
don ; they may settle down as residents, but with very
few exceptions, they are not indigenous to the country.
London doesn’t create reputations. It buys them. As
for the passing proteges of the “ smart set,” they are
praised only by those newspapers which the general
public don’t read. ‘ ‘ Reputation ” means something more
than a limited class notoriety, born in one season and
dead the next. A few English singers have made large
fortunes on a purely local fame, but they owed none of
their success to the patronage of the London Jewoeracy,
■or did they become famous suddenly. They took a long
time to arrive.

Walter Bentley, formerly known in these latitudes as a
stage, platform and pulpit performer, is just now doing
tragic sketches — i.e., playlets—at the London alls.
Walter’s first attempt in his new line of business was
Matthias’s Dream, taken from “ The Bells. Matthias,
the Burgomaster, was one of his “ star ’ parts when ne
came to Australia a dozen years ago. He narrowly

several other respects he was positively Immense.
“ T.D.” : In “ The Marriage of Kitty,” Rose Musgrove
sits down to the piano after cigaretting with her fatuous
husband, and sets to work on a few bars of Mendelssohn s

with both feet on the same song nowadays. Is it that, tne
“Spring Song” has descended to the position- of an
infantile study in place of the hideous “ Maiden s Prayer

M A P." gives an autobiography of circus-man J. A.
Bailey. He begun life, without a dollar, as a laboring-
boy with a circus, and rose to be partner with Cooper.
Cooper and Bailey’s Circus came to Australia in lb/6.
Then it proceeded to South America, via Maonland. the
partners were pretty well ruined in South America.
Bailey, however, took up another insolvent circus in the
U.S. and wrought it to such a pitch that it rivalled bar
num’s. Then he partnered with Barnum. Took the
show to London and Berlin. Barnum opposed the pur-
chase of Jumbo, the elephant, which whs Bailey s idea.
After Barnum’s death, Bailey bought his share foi
£500,000. He says Barnum did not understand circus

W. S. Gilbert got very mad the other day when a Lon-
don Times critic said that comic opera had been snuffed
out by musical comedy. The ca i‘ t ?' n ker o us hurno^musial

comedy, but by the deplorable death of Arthur Sullivan,
inasmuch as tlie musician left no. successor with whom he

cess.” From which one might conclude that Gilbert and
Sullivan had been harmonious collaborators all the years
of their joint celebrity and right up to the time of the
composer’s death. As a matter of fact, their last opera,
“The Gondoliers,” was more than ten years old when
Sullivan passed out, and subsequent to the quarrel that
ended their career as co-workers, Gilbert collaborated with
Alfred Cellier in the production of “The Mountebanks.
