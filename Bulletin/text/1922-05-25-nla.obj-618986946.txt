G.E. electric power appliances
have made production more
rapid and less expensive, re-
sulting in improved quality of
the finished products.
The hum of countless factories
proclaim the success of G.E.
motors in Australian industrial
activities.
Electrical development and G.E. are synony-
mous, for the General Electric Co. was early in
the field, and its large and efficient organisation
has constantly improved, and perfected, electrical
apparatus for a great variety of purposes.
The remarkable success achieved by G.E.
motors is exemplified in their reputation for
reliability and dependability.
The G.E. symbol rightly typifies quality,
service and the most improved design in every-
thing electrical.

A Cure for the Book Trade
The stocks of Australian booksellers are
large, yet there is a constant complaint that
standard books cannot he obtained. This is
partly due to the war, which had a ruinous
effect on the publishing of cheap reprints;
but is to be traced more directly to the
presence on the shelves of best-sellers in
such quantities that they elbow out the
best books. Only lately I heard of someone
having great difficulty in obtaining a
copy of Keats in Sydney! The
matter is not merely one of local incon-
venience ; for occasional notes in English
magazines suggest that conditions, are very
much the same there. Books that do not
sell with great rapidity are reduced in price
and got rid of to make room for utterly
worthless stuff which a section of the public
will readily buy. To say that if this prac-
tice is continued it will mean the death
of literature is to put the matter very
mildly; for it is not merely the death of
literature that is to be feared, but the
setting up of new standards of taste in
the name of literature which are x opposed
to ail that literature ever stood for-
Tako the case of Keats himself. He is
now the most loved of all English singers
by tens of thousands of readers. During
Itis lifetime his books sold slowly, and none
of them reached a second edition until 20
years after his death. Under the present
system Keats would have been shot out
at sixpence a copy to make room for Ethel
M. Dell, and would have been forgotten
long before the real public who could appre-
ciate him had arisen. Jane Austen’s novels
sold badly at first. Under the present sys-
tem she would probably he' quite dead —not
even preserved in libraries. , The book-
seller’s eagerness to keep his stock
moving naturally reacts on the pub-
lisher. He does not want works that have
a slow and steady sale. Give him some-
thing that will sell like hot cakes for .six
months and then be forgotten for ever. W.
M. Thackeray and S. T. Coleridge need
not apply. Their works are not what the
public wants; but G. It. Sims and Nat
Gould are really fine literature—the sort
of literature that will fill the till to-day
and the rubbish-bin to-morrow.
From the author’s point of view all this
is very depressing, and his remedy is not
very clear. In Australia the copyright law
hits him hard, but the bookseller tramples
him under his feet; and the bookseller is
really boss of the situation. Private pub-
lications by subscription, limited editions,
autographed and numbered, and other rather
poor dodges have been tried by way of
saving a thing of permanent literary value
from the man at the-counter; but none of
these methods is quite satisfactory. The
dictum that the public does not want a book
is hard to escape; though it is often clear
enough that it only means that the book-
seller is not trying very hard to sell it.
The. real question is whether a system can
be devised by which both publisher and
bookseller shall be forced to act in the in-
terests of permanent literature instead of
throwing their whole weight against it.
Great care must, ot course, be exercised
to avoid any limitation of the immediate
sales of the book of permanent value which
may also prove a best-seller. Such works
have really existed —not many of them, hut
a few, and often of first-class literary im-
portance. I believe “Tess of the I I’Urber-
villes” sold quite as well as “The Eternal
City” when it first appeared.
What I suggest is that all writers, educa-
tionists and good readers should combine
to promote a simple Publishers and Book-
sol leys Law which would go in a couple
of clauses right to the root of the whole
matter. Let it l>e laid down that any book
accepted for publication must be kept on
sale for a period of 25 years, and that any
bookseller failing to produce a new copy of
such a book within, say, three days shall
be subject to a lifcavy fine unless he can
prove that the publisher has allowed fit to
get out of stock, in which case the fine
shall lie inflicted on the publisher. Both
bookseller and publisher should be licensed,
arid after three finings a license should be
cancqlled.
The immediate effect of such a law would
be that every book must be considered for
publication on its ability to sell for 25
years—that is, on its permanent literary
value. No publisher would dare to risk
issuing a book for a sale of one month, no
matter how much the bookseller might de-
sire 1 it. Imported books from countries
where no such righteous law was in force
could fie provided for by making the fine
five times as great for failing to produce
a copy of anything that it could be proved
had ever been in his stock. This would
compel the bookseller to exercise the same
care in buying from overseas that the local
publisher had been compelled to exercise in
selecting books for printing.
•Anybody with a little imagination can
estimate the effect of such legislation on
the general reader. He or sbe —it is gener-
ally she—would have an entirely different
choice of books.and would complain bitterly
of the absence off the thin and evil literary
diet formerly provided ; but education would
begin at once. Within two years the same
readers would wonder how they had ever
given an hour to the consumption of such
inferior stuff. The publisher would lose no-
thing ; the bookseller would lose nothing:
the public would gain everything. Is there
anybody who could hammer such an idea
into the.skulls of politicians?
C. O. M.
Simplicity v. Bombast
Mr. Adrian Lawlor. word-dude, does the
“Block” on the Red Page < l.‘i/4/’22)-. Any
dandv is a smile-inspiring figure, and that
is all. Mr. Lawlor—-alas for the hit he
makes !—does not initiate a new effect. Flc
saunters for 10 minutes, turns a corner
■uid dies in the memory of his observers.
Speaking sincerely. I find that but one
phrase of Mr. Lawlor’s "Rhapsody on a
Broomstick” lingers in my mind and en-
chants it; that is his saying that certain
stylists "tuned the tongue of our race.”
Such specimens as this dismay it: "Fine
writing, by which I mean a prose imagi-
natively, richly, flamboyantly, and, there-
fore, unfasbionably conceived, is so abhor-
rent to the prevailing taste that the splen-
did anachronistic language of no less a
genius than Doughty actually strikes a pert,
though representative, contemporary critic
as an ‘uncouth and outlandish lingo.’ ” That
is unbeautiful and opposed to Mr. Lawler’s
own definition of Fine Writing, except in
regard to flamboyancy.
The use to. a mixed audience of such words
that sandbag the mind as "quintessential,”
“terminology,” “campaniles,” "architec-
tonics,” "prolegomena,” etc., makes one feel
that the matter embracing them fails on
a point of “imaginativeness” and “richness,”
and is only a display of knowledge of .the
dictionary in its most tedious aspects. Yet
it is hardly a mixed audience to Mr. Lawlor
himself, as —to show up by contrast his
own “sounding phrases,” which are not
flowery but forest-iike, for they stand awe-
somely against the sky of the reader’s dis-
comfited comprehension in the same way as
giant gums spread against the heavens —he
makes it say: "Who the blazes wants
nowadays to read*an author for the sake of
his style? Give us a book with guts in it
and leave Fine Writing to seho’olma’ams.
Fine Writing doesn’t butter any parsnips!”
Mr. Lawlor, in fact, has succeeded
only in revealing that his interpretation of
Fine Writing is extravagant. diction.
Accordingly, it is without charm, except
for the one instance I have given : a lonely
violet in a field of big-leaved marshmallows.
I read “Lorna Doone” when I was going
to school —-long before the hobby of string-
ing sentences together occurred tm me. Even
at that stage of half-perception I saw that
Blaclunore’s achievement is simplicity of
language. There is not a single Lawlorism
in it. Any pedant can juggle with long
words; true art refrains from their employ-
ment. On the other hand, how readily pro-
verbs, being un-Lawlored, spring to the
tongue! The success of the craftsmanship
of the proverb-builders is a standing lesson
to author and authorling alike.
Long words are indiscreet vehicles for
conveying “beautiful thoughts.” Arnold’s
“Essays on Criticism” quote Jouhcrt on
that: “It is by means of familiar words that
styh- takes hold of the reader and gets pos-
session of him. It is by means of these that
great thoughts get currency and pass for
true metal, like gold and silver, whiefi have
a recognised stamp put upon them. They
beget confidence in the man who, in order
to make his thoughts more clearly perceived,
uses them”.... A beautiful woman must
move gracefully, so must sentences. Style
overdone becomes stylishness, dudishness—a
loss of effect.
Fine writing yearns in us all, but it is
not the Adrian Lawlor type. Like every
other kind of impetuosity, the feeling needs
to he restrained, rebuked and advised; it
then tames down to an acceptable form. It
is a richer day that has a glorious sunset:
in the same way, prose possessing a flight of
fancy or two is improved. Just a lovely
line, or perhaps a pithy philosophy, but it
fastens. Not so the roll of majestic nouns,
lordly adverbs and stately adjectives so deli-
cious to Mr. Lawlor.
Mr. Lawlor is sound on on* 1 point. Fine
Writing may be perfectly sincere. Poetry
proves that. A line by an unknown poet
flashes in my mind here : "And Evening let
her curtain down and pinned it with a star!”
That is Fine Writing in the best degree.
Because there are millions of such gems of
thought. My. Lawlor is far from .being the
“solitary devotee” of Fine Writing that he
believes himself to be,

COMOX
tiCCl**
Comox in the
Steel Mill and Foundry
Steel Mill needs more than a roaring blast
furnace. It must have the help of
COMOX! Masses of metal must be cut into
convenient sizes for efficient melting. Comox
(Oxy-Acetylene) Blowpipes do this work
quicker than a saw goes through wood. When
tap holes of furnaces are choked with adhering
metal, Comox Blowpipes soon clear the outlet.
And, most important, steel production is
accelerated by the simple process of enriching
the air blast with Oxygen, thus inducing a mors
rapid reaction.
In the modern foundry, COMOX (Oxy-Acety-
lene) Blowpipes are very profitably employed.
Defective castings, cracked or filled with blow-
holes, are filled and fused by COMOX Welding
Blowpipes. Risers and adhering metal are
rapidly cut away by COMOX Blowpipes, cast-
ings being cleaned up in minutes compared to
hours by old-fashioned methods.
Every industry gets some help from COMOX,
either from its own plant or from a Comox
Welding Station. Whatever metal article—
from garden fork to battleship propellor—
Comox will make it strong as new again for
much less than cost of replacement. Ask for
(a) particulars of Comox Welding Plants, (b)
address of your nearest welder.

PINKETTES
FOR CONSTIPATION
Constipation is dangerous be-
cause it means that poisonous
materials which should have been *
expelled from the body are being
retained. The appetite fails, diges-
tion becomes disordered and the
breath offensive. Pinkettes,the new
laxative, are a real help in correct-
ing constipation.
They do not aggravate the com-
plaint as strong purgatives do; and
they do not wear out in their effects.
Taken according to directions they
assist the patient so that the use of
an opening medicine is not a con-
stant necessity.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Envy.
The white walls that I know so well were
gone a while to-day,
I sailed the seas of all the world : for one
hour I was free.
For that old tramp the Ankabar dropt anchor
in the bay,
And some fellows of the sea
Came off to visit me.
’Tvvas talk of men, seas, ships and ports
that swept me far away.
But I came back again,
When those seafaring men
Were shuffling out —the neat nurse said
she could not let them stay.
And now the talk of all of them, a-running
in my head,
Starts longing for the other days, the life
I used to know.
True men, long seas, snug ports, old ships:
their names in easy flow.
Old Brady knifed in the Yucatan
By a lascar stokehold crew.
A mad typhoon in the Sea of Japan,
Bed days of booze of the Wraith’s old man,
And a brawl in a Bio stew.
’Frisco and Durban, grey Shanghai—-
My mind flicks round the earth.
Whirling and mixed, the thoughts fly by
To great events that papers cry,
And things of little worth.
Then words that go with a life at sea
(The music of four bells)
These most of all stir longing in me :
They take my heart and urge their plea,
Whip me through seven hells.
For, alas, I cannot go,
I can take no watch below,
Nor breathe oiled air in engine-rooms, nor
scan the seas ahead.
My time for that is gone,
My days at sea are done.
The Ankabar sets sail at dawn —and I
would that I were dead.
VICTORIA.
BRUCE LONIE.
A Dream of Living Years.
I heard the dead years walking on brown
leaves,
Each restless footfall made a rustling sigh ;
And the low wind went by as one who grieves
For all lost loveliness beneath the sky.
The day was but a promise in the east,
Night hovered in the misty shadows cold ;
But on the hills a silver light increased.
Counting the little gains to coming gold.
And I was sad for those grey steps that
came
Nearer and nearer up the shadowy way—
Thin ghosts that wore a number for a name,
Buried in books through the blue, laughing
day.
Ah, these had raised a smoky cypress head
A liandbreadth nearer to the autumn sun,
And kept a harvest faith with men tor bread
And ripened the red wine their brothers
won!
And these had talked with sages in the
dawn,
And walked with beauty all a summer
day ;
And these had tossed red roses on a lawn
Where kings that shook the world were
babes at play.
And some there were that knew but want
and fear,
And some that clashed gay bells for mad-
dened pride;
But of the moving throng no ghost drew near
That had not seen red murder ere he died.
Yet the years slew not. Life, not death,
they sought.
They cried of sweetness all about men’s
dreams;
And valiantly their little moments wrought
Amid the dust to save the golden gleams.
There was no year of all the years I heard
But made a music on forgotten reeds,
Clear as the calling of a happy bird.
To lure a groping world to gracious deeds.
Then, as I listened, suddenly there grew
Above the sighs a throb of beaten drums
And resonant trumpets all the clear air
through,
As when a victor to his triumph comes.
No longer with a thin and ghostly tread.
But with great steps that shook the dawn-
ing day,
The vast years moved, their flaming banners
spread.
Their broad robes gleaming in the golden
way.
All trophies of all ages there were piled
On one triumphal car drawn by white
hours
That tossed their silver manes in airs as nnld
As the first sweet of spring that calls the
flowers.
Then on a burst of sound great silence fell.
I felt the awed world’s heart grow
strangely still;
Yet hi my heart I knew that all was well—
The silver turned to gold upon the hill.
And the meat years stood silently and
smiled.
Oh. we of little faith, how shall we reap?
The mornihs>' found the window of a child —
Time’s rose of all the victor years asleep.
N.S.W.

BOILING BLOOD TRIUMPHS OVER
COLD REASON.
“My blood boils when I hear of people preaching
Communism, or assailing the Christian religion, or
sneering at this fair Empire of ours. These things
must and will be stopped by the Government.”—
T. J. Ley, N. S. Wales Minister for Justice.
The Tibetan Alahatmas who have reached
the “adept” stage are known to possess re-
markable powers of self-persuasion. One of
them decides, perhaps, that it will benefit
his soul and do no harm to his constitution
if he sits on a rock or in a swamp without
changing his position for several years; and
there, accordingly, he may be observed winter
and summer till the end of his period of
probation, hale and hearty in circumstances
which would mean sudden death to another.
The gift is not confined to the colored races,
as is evidenced by the case of Air. Ley. He
has been talking cheap heroics for so many
years in order to secure the votes of the
illiterates of the shabby-genteel suburb in
which he lives that he has come to believe in
the stuff himself. As a specialist in sectarian-
ism he has always advocated a number of
futile measures designed to annoy the Catho-
lics—the inspection of nunneries, penal laws
against the promulgation of certain papal
decrees and so on. As a Loyalist—one of
those odd Loyalists who have never so far
lost their heads as to fight for the Flag
abroad, but who become perfectly furious
when told that it has been sneered at by
some negligible ass at home—-he has pro-
mised pains and penalties for critics of the
Empire in a thousand little halls and bethels.
And as a representative of Property lie has
warned those who would interfere with the
capitalistic system, even to the extent of
arguing that a different system might be
preferable to it, that with him in power gaol
will be the medicine for such seditious utter-
ances. Now the miracle has happened, and
he is in power. So far he has publicly
pledged the Fuller Ministry
(1) To amend the existing law “so as to prohibit
any from declaring or suggesting- that a marriage
celebrated according to the law of the land is
invalid.”
(2) To revive the Sedition Lavs.
(3) To revive the Blasphemy Laws.
(4) To “devise some means of closing the Socialist
Sunday-schools.”
To credit Mr. Ley with believing that this
insane programme, or any part of it, can
be enforced in a 20th-century British com-
munity is to say that he is as ignorant of
the history of England’s struggle for free-
dom as the neurotic little haberdashers and
house-agents and small-goodsmen of his
suburb who dream about Popes and awake
screaming of Rome. To assume that he has
committed the Government to the extent he
has (and under our theory of constitutional
practice all his colleagues are bound by his
\vords) from a determination to put himself
right at any price with the sectarian vote
which helped so materially to return him
to the Assembly, is to say that he is cynically
unscrupulous even for a politician. The ex-
planation of his trouble which this paper
prefers is self-hypnosis—that he has orated
himself into believing that his schemes are
feasible and statesmanlike. This theory is
preferable if only because it contains pros-
pects for him of conversion and for N. S.
Wales of a period of peace and good gov-
ernment in the coming years.
* * *• *
All Mr. Ley’s proposals for limiting freedom
have been tried by different despots, political
and religious, in the past, and all have
failed. Three centuries ago the flower of
English Protestantism was driven to
America, and those who stayed at home
were bitterly persecuted for the very offence
now charged against Australian" Catho-
lics (and, incidentally, against Austra-
lian Anglicans)—that of accusing cer-
tain lay ordinances of spiritual in-
validity. As a matter of fact, this
conflict between, on the one hand, laws
men believe to he divine, and, on the other,
laws which they know to he human lias
formed the basis of all religious persecution
since Calvary. And it is one of the several
directions in which materialism has had to
acknowledge defeat. The pithiest explana-
tion that this paper knows is to be found at
Martha Bay, Jamaica, engraved on the breech-
block of one of those weapons which Mr.
Ley has never heard fired in anger—“ Rebe-
llion to tyrants is obedience to God.” The
logical corollary of the Britisher’s hardly-
won right to preach what religious tenets
he likes is the right to also preach atheism
—and a long line of illustrious Englishmen
has done it unchecked. It is difficult, if
not impossible, to say the length to which a
British subject may not go in criticising
a Government. Shortly before the London
Conference which resulted in the creation of
the Irish Free State men like Lord Bryce,
Lord Robert Cecil and Lord Grey were
comparing Lloyd George’s Government to
that of Abdul Hamid, and the officials of
the Crown in Ireland to Bashi Bazouks.
And 20 years earlier Lloyd George had
directed very similar criticism against the
Ministers behind the Boer War. Neither the
matter nor the spirit of these complaints
was new. Over a century ago Horace Wal-
pole wrote:—
We have acquired an Empire (in India) in whose
plains the beggars we sent out as laborers can reap
sacks of gold ; and who, with their sickles and reap-
ing-hooks, have cut the throats of, as well as robbed,
those who sowed the grain.
Rank disloyalty, of course, but it was not
t'\e English way, even then, to prescribe
gaol for such expressions of opinion. The
orientation of the Fuller Government, under
the direction of its astonishing Minister for
Justice, is, of course, right away from the
British model and in the direction of the
condition of affairs which prevailed in pre-
revolutionary France. Ecclesiastics, whose
blood, like Air. Ley’s, boiled with fatal readi-
ness, decided what should be published,
whether as speeches, sermons, books or news-
papers. Rousseau, Voltaire, Alontes-
quieu and many others, whose writings are
now the pride of France, were adjudged
criminals and forced to flee to England—
where such of the inhabitants as could read
had been studying their Swift for genera-
tions. The difference between the two civil-
isations was that in England the Govern-
ment did not concern itself with the mould-
ing of public opinion, either political or reli-
gious, while in France it attempted little
else. And France was presently to be shat-
tered by the revolution which latitudinarian
England escaped. If the Fuller Govern-
ment desires to proceed against people for
preaching Communism or atheism, or criti-
cising the Empire or the men who are run-
ning it, in order to bring down the tempera-
ture of its Leys, then there is no reason
why the latter should put up with the in-
convenience of boiling blood for a moment
longer. The Acts of a darker age than ours
have merely to be disinterred, and a docile
police force will do the rest. Jurors may
refuse to see eye to eye with Ministers, as
happened in the case of Bishop Liston, of
ALL., last week; but, after all, to know that
the enemy has been arrested, placed in a
dock and put to the expense of a trial, is
bound to afford a measure of relief.
That is how the Government will proceed
if it is so eager to gratify members of the
P.D.A. and the King and Empire League
that it is indifferent as to how much help
it gives to the revolutionaries and anti-
Christians of the Commonwealth. It is a
platitude to say that such folks live and
thrive on treatment of the sort. Clerical
and political persecution produced the French
Revolution and French atheism, and the
same wooden-headed forces laid the founda-
tions of Bolshevism in Russia. One of the
most ominous features of present-day social
life in Australia is-the turning-away that is
evident everywhere from the churches and
from Parliaments. This tendency has always
been the precursor of trouble in the older
countries. It is a movement which cannot
be begun or greatly accelerated by abuse from
outside: practically the whole motive power
comes from within the institutions con-
cerned. When people see churches which
are supposed to preach peace and goodwill
disseminating, through their priests ar.d par-
sons, as much class or racial or sectarian
hatred as possible they listen readily to the
atheist who claims that there can be no
divine inspiration behind so much bitterness
and folly. And when Parliaments are seen
to be in charge of self-seeking and ignorant
men, blasphemers, drunkards, tricksters, ready
to exploit any human weakness or prejudice
as a means of advancing their party
and through the party themselves, then it is
not difficult for the opponents of the estab-
lished order to demonstrate that Representa-
tive Government is a failure, and that the
Soviet system (say) might be better and
could hardly be worse. The real cure for
the manifestations which cause the blood of
Mr. Ley to boil is, therefore, not repression
or anything like it. but the reverse. If he
wants to deal the forces of godlessness and
revolt a really stunning blow he has merely
to apply the principles of Christianity to the
Government of N. S. Wales. It would be
much less exciting; there would be no vitu-
peration or innuendoes or threats or insult-
ing language calculated to inflame the oppo-
sition ; his blood would cease to boil, and
so would the blood of his political opponents.
But his reward for giving up the old life
of blither and melodrama and limelight would
be the knowledge that, at long last, he really
had done something of value for religion and
the Empire.
A POLICY FOR THE COMMON-
WEALTH.
The good ship Commonwealth, wandering
rudderless on the high seas and showing an
affrighted tail to every rough wind that blows,
is a distraught and belated spectacle. It is
overdue . at every known political port,
having in this respect an even worse
record than that of the fabled San
Gregorio, which is 400 years late at Aca-
pulco Bay only. The captain is a man of
good but not superlative capacity as —in
cinema parlance—a spruiker, and he is
dowered with a sticking quality which
excels that of the porcupine, a useless
animal, but harder to extract from a
hole than any other of its weight.
(In evidence 'of the fact .that dura-
bility is no proof of merit it has been pointed
out "that six kings held on to the English
throne for astonishingly long periods, in-
cluding three fairly regular lunatics, ( one
who fell into premature senility, one Saxon
of doubtful sanity, and a wild, inflamed char-
acter with too many wives.) The skipper
of the Commonwealth is eaten up with
vanity, like Herod Agrippa 1., yet judged
by actual finished accomplishment his ability
is that of the average cabin-boy. A com-
mon theory is that he has much unused
ability, but keeps it latent because doing
things makes enemies and making enemies
loses office, and he is convinced that his re-
tention of office is by far the most important
event that could happen to Australia. So
this is, and has been since the present head
of affairs first began to be a power, the land
of Nothing Done —except trivial, non-con-
tentious things and the provision of billets
for the friends who represent support and
hence more office. And, meanwhile, Legion
is an insufficient name for the matters that
cry out for attention if Australia is to go
forward.
The provision of a uniform railway gauge
is urgent, even if it is only the cheap 34-footer
that South Africa puts up with, and which
is the measurement of more than half the
Australian lines. No serious effort at all
has been made to deal with our worst sample
of broken gauge, though thi? is a case in
which the Federal Government really has a
unique “pull.” It is 1684 miles from Adel-
aide to Perth; the Commonwealth owns
1051 of them ; and the gauges are 5 [ft., 34ft.,
4ft. 84in., and then 34ft. again ! The nation
urgently wants uniform and comprehensive
laws dealing with banking and insurance,
bankruptcy, marriage and divorce. If none
of these things can be got, as alleged, with-
out a constitutional amendment, then it is
the Government’s business to begin a cam-
paign for a referendum, and go on campaign-
ing. The amount of law and law costs that are
wasted for lack of uniformity is appalling,
and the amount of contempt that the Com-
monwealth earns by leaving in the hands of
State authorities powers which the nation
should be wielding is appalling also.
In this connection any Federal Ministry
worth the name would set about the redemp-
tion of the 18 or 19 millions’ worth of £lO6O
notes that are still in existence, save any
that the banks actually want for exchange
purposes. They were issued for war reasons,
but apparently this semi-compulsory loan
without interest is becoming permanent. The
same sort of Government might ask itself if
its Commonwealth Bank is, or is not, an
insolvent institution, seeing that it issues
notes bearing a printed promise to pay in
gold, a.nd now not even 10s. in gold is pro-
curable. This isn’t a war matter; the new
situation arose the other day, in the piping
times of peace. It might further consider
if it isn’t wasteful to keep £23,550,000 of
gold lying idle and earning nothing as a
redemption fund, if nothing is to be redeemed.
-> * * *
It is sufficiently evident that the attempt
to settle the Northern Territory with lease-
hold farmers has failed. This isn’t neces-
sarily the Territory’s fault. The Canberra
area is losing population under the same
system. Instead of having a heartening gamble
in unearned increment the settler lives in the
constant shadow of re-appraisement, and
there are, likewise, too many chances of re-
sumption to make a roadless country attrac-
tive. The question of taking over the State
debts, or at least the whole debt of the least
embarrassed State and a corresponding pro-
portion of the others, has assumed a new
aspect since Queensland began to pawn itself
to the U.S., which may want to take out its
bill in territory or “concessions” in case of
trouble. Federal control, or even partial
control, plus a solid sinking fund might do
much good at a crisis, and could do no harm.
It is the business of any Prime Minister who
is not a mere office-holder to give a strong
lead in favor of the creation of new States.
It has been shown invariably that the popu-
lation which this country so badly needs
arrives from somewhere, and that without
costing the country anything, and settles
round a new capital, if it be only the capital
of a 34th part of the continent; while it
has been shown, almost as often, that popu-
lation which this country so badly needs
country wants more capitals. In the" second
place, when one or two States grow so influ-
ential that politicians begin to bid for their
support with promises of State railways built
at Federal expense it is a hint that there is
need for more and smaller States. The pro-
posal to divert the Federal South-to-North
line from Federal territory into N.S.W. and
Queensland is nominally based on the alleged
extra fertility of these parts. The Prime
Minister’s utterly gratuitous promise to spend
Federal money on completing a purely local
line for these same two States makes the
whole railway policy look like a vote-buvin"
expedition.
* * * ■*
The new policy for the Commonwealth
should have no room in it for a leader who,
after all his years of fuss and salary, says
he is as naked as when he was born of any
opinion on such an overshadowing question
as the New States matter and will “leave it
wholly to Parliament,” while he takes big
financial affairs out of the hands of Parlia-
ment, and reaches out vast sums as if the
public funds were his own. And this at a
time when a deficit of some £4,000,000 has
grown up in 40 months. The new poliev
should include the abolition of Bureaux of
Commerce and Industry, Institutes of Science
and Industry, foreign Trade Commissioner-
ships and the baby bonus, for which there is
nothing to show save a reduction in the birth-
rate. It should cut down a thousand ex-
penses, including Ministerial trips abroad
banquets, motor-cars and that useless fossil’.
Australia House. The men of the new order
should publish the balance-sheet of the Com
monwealth ships, that dark mystery which
the Prime Minister hides inside his singlet
as if it were his private porous-plaster; also
they should either make the mystery-line pay
or sell it. They should either do something
with Canberra or sell it, too. In every way
they should endeavor to remember that this
is a great, empty, open, pioneering land, and
that it is nobler to make new provinces and
new towns than to plod about the streets
of old cities cadging for votes. Votes are
well enough in their place, but all the votes
of Bendigo, or even Sydney, are not worth
the spoiling of a continent.
REPATRIATION—AND STARVA-
TION.
It is a habit of “Nationalist” politicians,
when tackled about the mess their party has
made of repatriation, to take cover behind a
cloud of figures. The latest to resort to this
flimsy device is C. W. C. Mark, M.H.R.;
and being a Digger himself he ought to have
known better. "No country in the world,”
said Mark, at Granville (N.N.W.), recently,
“has done for its soldiers what Australia has
done for hers.”
Wav pensions have cost us £20,100,000, general
repatriation benefits £13,000,000, land settlement
£31,000,000, war-service homes £14,000,000 and
war gratuities £28,000,000. We have settled 25,400
men on the land, employed 9140 in the Common-
wealth Public Service, placed in general employment
121,339, assisted with sustenance 98,679 and voca-
tionally-trained 14,077. Our total expenditure on
soldiers has been nearly £113,000,000.
The objection to these glittering statistics is
that they tell only half the story, and that a
familiar and recorded half. Considering
that the dailies of at least three capitals are
publishing heartrending stories of destitution
among the Diggers, the public would rather
be furnished with the undisclosed facts. It
would prefer to learn from Marr, M.11.R.,
or some other authority (1) what proportion
of the 14,077 vocational trainees has found
employment, and (2) how many of the
121,”,')!) soldiers mentioned as having been
provided with jobs retain them. Also (3),
the number of Digger public servants who
have received or are in hourly expecta-
tion of the sack. Further (4), how much
of the £13,000,000 expended in “general re-
patriation benefits” i,s represented by the
mortgages on bankrupt boarding-houses, ham-
and-beef shops, secondhand-bookstalls, green-
groceries, cool-drink dives and chicken-
ranches. Finally (6), whether the war-
service homes, which cost £14,000,000, and
the ready-made farms, in which £31,000,000
has been sunk, are worth 60 per cent, of those
amounts, or are ever likely to be? Without
such information—and it is not likely to be
supplied—the vaunt of Marr, M.H.R., is
vain.

A select committee of the House of Reps,
was engaged for a year or more in proving
that in the erection of shacks for trusting
warriors there had been besotted bungling
and criminal waste of money. Another
committee or commission will be needed
presently to go into the case of the soldier-
settler. Poor land, dear land, slumping
prices and mounting instalments are
among his troubles. As long as the boom
lasted he wasn’t much heard from, but the
boom has gone irrecoverably, and the position
has become serious; and letters like the fol-
lowing, from a Victorian settler, are arriv-
ing at newspaper offices in large numbers: —
Unless values are written down and terms made
easier a large percentage of the 25,000 Diggers that
Hughes dumped on the land will be shoved off it.
Our farms cost such enormous sums, and the scale of
repayments is so steep that nothing but successful
crops and highly-remunerative prices would have
enabled us to meet our engagements. No allowance
was made for side slips, such as indifferent crops
and low prices, and these have arrived —poor seasons
in some cases ; low prices in all. Naturally we have
fallen heavily in arrears. Now the Repat. steps in.
In my district it sent a representative with a black
list to all the agents handling our produce, the inti-
mation being that consignments placed with them
for sale are liable to seizure. This has cut the
soldier-settler out of the metropolitan markets, and
as the return from his crop will barely pay living
expenses, In's situation is desperate.
Leaving pensions and gratuity payments
out of the argument it has cost £58,000,000
to run up a dismal collection of dear dwell-
ings, all in the cities; to train and finance
a multitude of small shopkeepers and wage-
earners, nearly all in the cities (many of
the shopkeepers have gone bung and many of
the wage earners can’t get work), and to place
the Digger-settlers on farms bought at in-
flated prices because (a) the primary indus-
tries were booming, (b) the owners weren’t


anxious to sell, and (C) the land was within
handy distance of the cities. The same
£58,000,000 expended on a statesmanlike
plan would have (1) built the North-South
railway, (2)' opened up rich new provinces
in Queensland, the Northern Territory and
Westralia, (3) developed Australia’s
neglected fisheries, and (4) constructed and
equipped a score of woollen mills, cotton
mills, freezing works and the like. And
there would have been sufficient remaining
to provide against the occurrence of such
scenes of utter misery and desolation as have
been witnessed in all the capitals, to the dis-
honor of the political caste, for months past.
But there was not a gleam of statesmanship
in the framing of the repatriation scheme,
nor has there been a particle of efficiency
in carrying it out. It has been run on Big-
City lines from first to last, and with
characteristic Big-City shiftlessness and in-
eptitude. Probably two-fifths of the returned
soldiers never received repatriation “benefits”
at all. They are the men who went straight
hack to their jobs, businesses, profes-
sions, grazing areas or farms ; and without
question, speaking generally, they are far
better off to-day than those who relied upon
the Government’s undertaking to find them
work, or who were helped into seedy shops
and hopeless enterprises of that description,
or who have been loaded with Government
houses built (sometimes jerry-built) at stag-
gering cost, or who are struggling in time of
slump with selections bought in the boom and
over-capitalised to a sinful extent. It has
been stated more than once that the work
>f _ the Repatriation Department is nearly
finished. The truth is, as far as a large
proportion of the Diggers is concerned, that
it will have to be done all over again.
TROPICS—TRUE AND FALSE.
A Bulletin writer jeered recently at the
phrase “true tropics,” asserting that there
are no “false tropics.” He was wrong.
Many people believe, a.s he evidently does,
that the lines usually shown on a map of
the world to represent the limits of the
Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn also show
the limits of what is known as the tropics.
The “true” tropic lines are not so geometri-
cally disposed: they are as irregular in out-
line as those of the prevailing winds or of
the ocean currents. It is the “false” tropic
lines that one sees depicted on maps. To
prove this, it is only necessary to glance
at a chart of the world’s mean annual tem-
perature. The isothermal line of Cancer
bends up and round the north of India,
almost to the mountain border, and it shows
that Bombay, Calcutta and Delhi are wholly
within the “true” tropics. Practically the
whole of India is within the area of tempera-
ture which averages SO degrees or more the
whole year round.
Bombay, Calcutta, Manila, Singapore a.nd
the rest were, a.s stated by The Bulletin,
created by white men. But it was for a
very good reason—to provide seaports for
the trade that was growing up with their
hinterland. And the natives naturally
Hocked to where the trade was. Delhi
existed centuries before the white man
stopped chasing the mastodon across the
plains of Europe. It was built in the first
place because it was on the great trade
route from the east; it remained im-
portant because of its strategic value
cor military purposes, and as it was the
possessor of a nice warm climate the black
races did not refuse to live there. Rio,
although on the Tropic of Capricorn, is (1)
on the sea, and (2) outside the isothermal
line of 80 degrees, and, consequently, ,not in
the “true” tropics.
In all the other cities mentioned bv
A'he Bulletin’s contributor—Delhi, Goa,
Havana, Port Louis, Tunis, Bagdad—
either trade or military position accounts
for their existence. If a gold-field were
found in the Antarctic to-morrow, there
would be a town there next week. Trade
recognises no climates. Mexico City was
built where it is as the result of a direc-
tion by the Aztec god to the Aztec people.
Like trade, religion knows no climates, or
Mecca would not be tolerated long as a place
of pilgrimage. The statements made about
the growth of Mexico City are un-
convincing—not to say dishonest. In 1900,
according to the Mexican census, the place
had a population of 300,000; in 1911 the
total was 400,000, and as it has been the
hub of a civil war for the past 10 or 11
years, it is not reasonable to suppose it has
increased since then by 600,000. The
“World’s Almanac” for 3 920 gives a list of
the 75 largest cities of the world, of which
only 14 contain one million or more, and
the. city of Mexico is not one of the 75.
whilst Sydney (N.S.W.) is. It is not stated
in The Bulletin article, as it should be,
that Mexico City is 7415 feet above the sea,
with a maximum temperature of 79 and a
minimum of 37 degrees—in fact a climate
like # that of Hobart (Tas.). It is
certainly within the Tropic of Cancer, 19
deg. north of the line, but the true
tropics are left behind at the 1000 ft.
mark. As to the people being white, the
1900 census says that 19 per cent, only are
“white” (the descendants of the Spanish
brigands of 300 years ago are about as
“white” as the ordinary Celestial), 38 per-
cent. are full-blooded Indians, and the rest
are cholos—half-bred Indians.
Bogota, another scarecrow, raised to be
knocked down, is in South America, 4deg.
north of the Equator, but 8563 feet alove
the sea. In July—mid-summer—it freezes
every night. Arctic flowers, among others,
bloom there all the year round. The popu-
lation consists principally of full-blooded
descendants of the Chibchas Indians and
half-breeds of the same tribe. The wealthier
inhabitants are, as usual, descendants of
the cross between the Spanish Conquista-
dores and the female Indian, but they are
better classed as a yellow race. Their Span-
ish forebears could not even boast white
blood —it had been liberally diluted with
the black blood of the Moors during their
400 years of occupation of Spain—and on
being transported to Bogota it has been
plentifully dashed with red Indian.
Quito, the city of the Equator, is 9343
feet above the sea. It is so cold that on
the warmest summer day the stranger wears
his winter clothes. The natives say
epigramatically that it rains there “13
months in every year.” Of the population
40 per cent, are full-blooded Indians, and
the balance are principally naif-nrecus. xne
blend has been described as “a type of de-
based Mongolian.”
To sum up, the White Australia ques-
tion has in a very real sense no-
thing to do with what The Bulletin
writer means by “tropics.” A high dry-
bulb thermometer is not the deterring factor
against the white man and his woman
settling the North ; the lion in the path is
a high icet-bulb thermometer, and the grave
importance of this indication of extreme
humidity cannot be too strongly stressed.
When the humidity reaches saturation with
a temperature of 70 degrees on the wet-
bulb thermometer, that is the limit of com-
fort to the white woman. From which it
is evident that White Australians will only
be born and reared in large numbers in
those parts of Northern Australia which
are false tropics. Advocates of a White
Australia can do no better service to their
cause than that of identifying and adver-
tising these regions.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Another Sectarian Row.
A j udicial view of it: —
The Theosophists, who are a sect, cult, philosophy
or combination of persons who meet for mental and
scientific research, are known and highly respected
in every Australian city. If the movement is
gradual and unobtrusive that is because it never
seeks vulgar notoriety by abusing a non-adherent or
burning a heretic. Theosophy lives in all climates. It
is supposed to have its seat in the higher Himalayas,
where the business-man breakfasts by candle-light in
winter because the gas is frozen, and breaks off the
flame with his umbrella before taking the yak to
his office; and it once had a summer branch at
Jericho, it possesses mahatmas (in the Himalayas
mostly), gurus, lumas (no relation of the animal
that spits, but aged persons of a monastic habit of
life who maintain a vow of perpetual dirtiness, taken
iu youth, with incredible fortitude), chelas and other
esoteric and introspective furniture. It is so
tolerant that a devotee may absorb it singly or in
conjunction with any other faith. This generosity
has brought undeserved trouble on the Sydney branch.
A leading light, named Leadbeatkr, was, or is, also
a light (a bishop, iu fact) of the Liberal Catholic
Church, and the two illuminations have become
mixed.
There is no mystery about the Liberal Catholics,
save possibly a doubt as to their origin and the
place and date and reason thereof, and what they
believe and what use they are. In Sydney they
number about 200, and they have a cathedral (or
should one say a cathedralette?) in Regent-street.
They possess two bishops, which is a considerable
pressure of bishop to the square inch of available
cathedral. The original bishop is alleged by
sceptics to have had holes in his consecration. If
this is so then, clearly, the rope of apostolic succes-
sion is tied to nothing at the other end. The
founder of a new church, which has no past, requires
the aid of a pope, cardinal, archbishop or bishop of
some other church, with a proved spiritual pedigree, to
consecrate him and give him a start:—-unless, of
course, like Cranmer, he gets his start, first, and
then joins the new church bringing his ill-gotten
apostolic succession with him in his carpet-bag.
After that he can spread it, like any other germ.
Some folk allege that the original Liberal Catholic
was fixed up by a painted sham, as no real prelate
would have anything to do with the business; that
the unction he passed on was bogus; and that, in
any case, the new man he consecrated left the
unprosperous sect so speedily that the line of descent
hacl to be spliced till it was all knots. Anyhow,
everybody concerned in this aspect of the unpleasant-
ness seems to be dead.
Meanwhile Leadbeatkr, the Double Light, is aged
75 now, and looks very stately in his alb and cope
and chasuble and mitre and whiskers and spiritual
crook, the curved end cf which is prehensile and
may be used to lasso stray lambs of the flock. But
someone has alleged, with delighted giggles, that he
was suspected of something (in his Liberal Catholic-
capacity, apparently, not his Theosophical capacity)
many years ago—in fact, about the time Little
Buttercup first mixed the “Pinafore” babies. Every-
thing is as vague as it can be, though, of course,
unspeakable revelations are earnestly desired in the
purest quarters. The Theosophies! Society, whose
unworldliness and ruminative calm unfit it for
stormy episodes of the sort, has taken the foggy
matter to heart, and it lias filled columns in the
papers, and the society’s great and cosmopolitan
priestess has come to Sydney and raised up ner
voice in song about it. It looks incongruous that
a world-wide institution, more or less related to
Buddha (600 b.c.) and distantly connected with
Paracelsus (real name, Theophrastus Bombastus
von Hohenheim, a.d. 1493), and with a head office
on the Himalayas and a branch at Jericho, should
talk disruption over a matter the other party to
which is a beehive tabernacle in a back street. In
fact, the business looks as superfluous as a row
betwen a member of the Tummas ’Enley Loyal Orange
Lodge (Snails’ Bay Branch) and one of the Mul-
doqn family over the inner spiritual life of ex-Sister
Liguori. But religious people are often like that.
If all parties would drop the futile business and
bury the axe and concentrate on something practical,
like paying off the N. S. Wales public debt, the
world might be the better for it.
♦
High Commissioners.
is there any reason, apart from the self-
seeking and jobbery which are fostered by
the party system, why Australia shouldn’t
adopt the practice of Canada and South
Africa in selecting its High Commissioners?
Their plan of appointing a good man and
then sticking to him has manifest advantages
over ours of chucking the billet to a party
hack, as a reward for party services or as
a means of shutting his mouth, and slinging
him out at the end of his term to make way
for another of the same kidney. A High
Commissioner, assuming he is a capable man,
to begin with, should be more useful after
three or six or nine years’ experience than
he was when he started. The Smith who
became Lord Stratiicona High Commis-
sioned for the Canadian Dominion on this
principle for nearly a score of years. The
Union of South Africa has only had two
Commissioners before the present one—
Solomon and Schreiner. Each died in
harness. Neither was what could be called
an active politician at the time of his ap-
pointment, and there was never any question
of either being superseded. George Reid
was Australia’s first appointee. He got
the job. not because he was the best man
available, not even because he was the best
politician available, but because it was desir-
able, in the interests of the party in power,
that this experienced trouble-maker should be
shifted to a distant clime. The High Com-
missionership enabled it to be done. At
the end of his term Reid managed to secure
a year’s extension because his old friends
happened to be in power; but in 1915 he got
•Ins walking ticket. Vainly he offered to do
the work for nothing. The billet (with
salary) had been earmarked for Andy
Fisher, who had by now become an embar-
rassment, not to say an incubus, in the eyes
of the more progressive members of his
party. Two years ago Fisher (after mak-
ing much the same stir in Britain as a half-
brick would have created if deposited gently
in a Victoria-s'treet office by night and left
there indefinitely) got the same treatment
that he and his colleagues had handed out to
Reid. Another party hack had established or
been conceded a lieu on the billet. Reid, on
being pushed forth, managed to get a seat
in the House of Commons, but Fisher
demonstrated that the fact of being an ex-
High Commissioner is no infallible passport
to a new job on a dignified scale. He returned
to Australia, apparently to see if what was
left of his old party would do anything for
him, but they showed so little enthusiasm
in tlie matter that he faded back to the F.K.
The latest heard of him was that he had
been turned down in a Scottish Labor selec-
tion ballot on the score of Jingoism or some-
thing similar. ‘ln a few years Cook— a
greyer, balder and more embittered Cook —
will no doubt be hunting for preferment, only
to discover a new generation has risen up
that knows not Joseph. Australia is not
likely to get High Commissioners of any real
worth on these Tammanyistic lines. The
system may be no great injustice to the man,
who knows what lie may expect by this
time, but it is rank folly from the standpoint
of the taxpayers who find the money for his
upkeep.
Lithographical Libels.
“G.M..T.”: It is a notable fact that people
such as Mr. Griffith Taylor who are so
indebted to the words Desert, Dreary
Wastes, Arid Lands and Waterless Tracts
for tin- propagation of pessimism about Aus-
tralia are unsupported by the reports of the
geologists who in the last year or so have
been visiting the Uninhabitable Interior.
They have returned with such pleasing
alterations to their maps as the frequent
substitution of the word "plain” for “desert”
and the pencilling-in of large areas wherein
the presence of water has been revealed or
in which mineral potentialities abound. West-
ralian explorer Canning once told me that
hundreds of miles back in the eastern divi-
sion of Groperland he had seen the winter
grass growing man-high for countless miles.
Yet the average map of Australia labels this
region ‘desert”! More recently Professor
David has announced, among other revela-
tions concerning ill-reputed parts of the
Commonwealth, that careful inspection of
the famous Nullarbor discovers it to be
punctured with pot-holes going down some-
times hundreds of feet to running fresh water.
These are but two instances, and intelligent
exploration of other reputedly desolate and
drought-stricken parts is resulting in the
disclosure about them of equally unpalatable
information to the hawkers of ancient ling.
Despite it all, however, the same old stupid
maps are in circulation, and the same pre-
posterous notion that mid-Australia i« a
second Sahara, hopeless and irreclaimable,
is encouraged. The evil is aggravated by the
map-maker’s abhorrence of cartographical
vacuums which Incite hun to use unneces-
sarily large type in the designation of such
blank spaces as the Great Victoria Desert
and the Great Sandy Desert, etc. It is
easy to understand how young Australia
comes away from a geography lesson with
the notion that he is inhabiting a country
Which is mostly useless. And it is appalling
to think that because of the hasty judgment
of a tew early amateur explorers the outside
world, most Australians and Mr. Griffith
Taylor should be committed to the con-
clusion that this country is like a quoit, all
edge and no middle. Isn’t it time wo began
to fight such suggestions? A sound pre-
liminary step would be to rake in as many
of these lithographical libels on our con-
tinent as possible, and send our picture forth
anew into the world, tailored, barbered —
and desertless ! Even be it that, there are
a few deserts left, we might have the national
tact to call them plains.
Capital Punishment.
“Sociologist” wants the position tidied up:
The World War, it is often asserted, cheapened
human life; by making violent death on the largest
scale so common as to be almost commonplace it
took away, or seemed to subtract, something of
the heinousness of the act of killing outside of war-
fare. Is it a sequence of this, or a contradiction of
it, that a convicted murderer has more chances of
escaping the gallows, in Australia, than ever he
had before 1914? There may be less tendency to
magnify his crime, unless it is of the vilest sort,
but, if human life is indeed held more cheaply, why
should the Law itself develop an increasing compunc-
tion about killing the killer? Almost certainly this
is happening. In New South Wales, where, almost
within the memory of most of us, the Law was more
implacable and bloody in avenging the taking of
life than in any part of the British Empire, there
has been a revulsion suggesting, some people may
think, a tendency to go to the opposite extreme.
Where the gates of mercy were once, too often, shut
with a clang, now they stay ajar or open at the
gentlest of pushes. In Victoria, the feeling aroused
over the recent execution of Colin Ross was not
entirely due to the conflict of evidence, the widely -
held opinion that the man, because of his recor;"., was
pre-judged, or the subtle taint that must attach to
witnesses whose testimony, if accepted, is paid for
in blood money. All that may have counted. But
the hangman so rarely gets a job nowadays that,
when he is requisitioned, the event becomes far
more momentous and arresting than wheil executions
were frequent. Hanging has ceased to be the rule
for convicted murderers, and become exceptional
Hence there is, and must continue to be, more and
more controversy about the exceptions, the out-size
in murderers in whose favor Judges and Executives
can find nothing whatever to warrant any milder
punishment than the retribution that is supreme
and irrevocable.
Whether or not public opinion is changing, it is
going to be no easy matter, here or elsewhere, to
alter the letter of the Criminal Code in regard to
the maximum penalty for wilful murder. If the
objections are old enough to be stereotyped, the
arguments in favor of a change have little novelty.
Capital punishment, most of us began to learn in
our debating-society stage, is a survival from the
Dark Ages, an anachronism in humanitarian times, no
deterrent, the worst use to which you can put a
man, whatever he has done, and so forth. “Abolish
legal slaying” has always been the cry of a section,
probably waxing stronger, and the retort of their
opponents is still that “Messieurs les assassins’’ can
best do it by ceasing to slay lawlessly. And what
possible worthy use a Deeming or a Laxiuuj is deemed
capable of being put to, by being locked up for the
term of his natural life, is still as problematical as
ever it was. It is true that many countries have
abolished capital punishment, but it is equally true
that few of such countries are very forward in the
procession of civilisation-cwm-humanitarianism, and
some of them are much nearer the tail. In Britain,
in France and in most of the United States of
America no person may take another’s life with-
out risking his own, although the risk in some
cases, where so-called “unwritten law’’ can be
used for a shield, may amount to very little. It is
only a detail, but perhaps not altogether an unim-
portant one, that France and America have each
found a way of executing murderers that is somewhat
less barbarous and hideous in its accessories than
hanging. If capital punishment continues, there is no
reason why the guillotine and the electric-chair
should not he improved on. The most abominable
criminal, once the community insists on being rid of
him, should be allowed to make bis exit by the least
painful and ignominious route. As far as is pos-
sible, he might even lie spared the torture of antici-
pation.
N r o doubt there are murderers and murderers. To
some extent juries have generally recognised this,
and Governments frequently, although Judges are
hardly authorised to discriminate. One distinction
( t lie late O. Henry's) is between the man who
“beats down his enemy in the open, hushed by the
primal passions and....the human rat or spider.”
If the Law could only express this distinction in a
Criminal Law Amendment Act and decree that the
death penalty he reserved for the human rat and
spider, capital punishment might have fewer critics
an<l assailants. There might also be less tearful
sentimentality over the sacredness of tinman life even
when its possessor had exhibited himself as something
lower than the spider or the rat—-consider the
“humanness” of the last man who went to the gat-
lows in South Australia, for poisoning his own chil-
dren.’ Meanwhile. Hie Sydney propagandists for the
abolition of capital punishment are on dangerous
ground when they ask people to believe that the
death penalty has been already abolished by quiet
agreement and tacit convention in New South Wales,
simply because nobody has been hanged there for
some time. Unwritten law is highly unsatisfactory
material out of which to weave an appeal to a jury,
although Judges cannot always prevent it and some-
times condone it. In this case it seems to be sug-
gested that the Government has been commuting
for such a long period the sentences of men con-
demned to be hanged by the neck that no murderer
need ever fear the gallows again; that the Govern-
ment itself has left an unwritten law for its succes-
sors to observe. No Government can do that, not
even one (hat lias the abolition of capital punishment
on the purely ornamental part of its programme, and
if the impression is once suffered to gain ground the
next convicted murderer who finds himself going
gallows-ward will have a grievance against the
Abolition of Capital Punishment League, lie may
even complain that he was misled by it. It might
not be impossible to re-east the law dealing with
homicide and make it more acceptable to the en-
lightened humanitarian class without depriving the
State of the right to exterminate the noxious reptile
in human guise as well as to segregate him. There
may be few convicted murderers in extenuation of
whose crimes nothing can be urged, but there are
some. There always have been and there always
must be.
Is There Such a Difference?
Dear Bulletin,—You remark (11/T>/’22) :
Anything less like Terrorists than the seedy ward-
bosses who hang round Macdoneli House it would
lit difficult to imagine... .They are not Terrorists
but Tammanyists... .They reproduce in action, not'
the Jacobism of Marat but the paternalism of Boss
Croker .... Conjure up a picture of the A.L.P.
executive, with knives between their teeth and
caps of Liberty on their heads, dragging Potts
Point and Point Piper to guillotines ,set up. in the
Martin-place de la Revolution. That is one of those
visions of horror that provoke only derision.
Now, are the would-be upheavalists of Mac-
donell House so different from their 18th cen-
tury idols, in the essentials V It is unlikely
of course, that Macdoneli House would
rush round with a knife between its teeth
and a cap of Liberty on its head, dragging
Potts Point to the guillotine. But, then,
neither Robespierre .nor St. Just did that
sort of thing, though their humble folllowers
were encouraged to do so. And as for drag-
ging Potts Point, which is now mostly hash-
houses and Hebrews, to the scaffold, the idea
is out of date. (Ire of the things that made
this such a pleasant sport for the French
while it lasted was the convention which in-
sisted on members of the ancien regime
“going quietly,” as the police say. Anyone
who witnessed the uproar and the anguish
of Danny Levy, the month before last, at
the prospect of being booted out of the
Assembly can imagine what would occur if
an attempt were made to push him into a
tumbril and wheel him through the public
streets to a place of execution. The idea is
enough to appal even a Bill Lambert. To
turn to another aspect of the question, the
Terrorists were mostly shabby men who
wore the then equivalent of >-each-me-down
suits and bull-nosed boots, as in the case
of the Macdoneli Housers (one must
leave out of this category, of course,
P. Egalite, who was no revolutionist but
merely a vicious royal duke, who wanted his
cousin’s throne and desired to make a mis-
tress of his cousin’s wife, and who chose the
wrong instruments). Of the real men I sup-
pose only Robespierre and Hebert were less
badly-tailored than the Macdoneli House
push. They were mostly physical weeds,
Danton being a clumsily-shaped exception.
They grievously lacked personal courage, and
with war raging by land and sea I don’t
remember that one of them was killed or
even wounded in action. The corpse may
have slipped my memory, however, corpses
being notoriously slippery concerns. Most
of them died in affright, some shrieking
with fear. They were utterly non-con struc-
tive, but as the Terror lasted less than a year
there was hardly time to notice this. Barring
Robespierre they were almost unanimously
more monstrous thieves than even a Labor
alderman has a right to be. Danton’s
chateau was a thing of beauty, and Carrier


after all, there’s only one ‘AUST RALIA’ ’

required waggons to carry his golden plunder

King Cotton anti North Australia.
“Barcoo” discerns a great industry in the
offing
Queensland is on the map as a cotton producer
again. Here in Rockhampton the local gin is near-
ing completion, and the depot has housed 368,6341 b.
of short-staple seed cotton for treatment as soon as
the mill gear begins to turn, and that ought to be
in a fortnight or three weeks. Three gins comprise
the outfit, which is the last word in modernity.
Running full capacity they can treat 40001 b. of seed
cotton per hour, and that quantity will yield approxi-
mately 15001 b. of cotton lint. After extraction the
seeds will be stored for treatment later on as a by-
product. Another mill is to be installed in the
neighborhood of Brisbane. There is hardly any part
of Queensland that won't grow cotton. It thrives
equally well on the hot, dry western plateau and
on the moist tropical lands of the east coast.
As for Central Queensland,, it is claimed that the
cotton grown in the Clermont district lias no superior
in the world for texture, strength and purity of
color. And North-Westralia has cotton possibilities,
too. Bishop Tito wee, who spent years in Nyasaland
before coming to Australia, is emphatic on that
point:—
The climate of North-Westralia is the same as that
of Nyasaland, and there is no question in regard to
the cultivation of cotton. The schoolmaster at Derby
planted four different kinds of cotton in the school
grounds, and left them absolutely to the natural con-
ditions. The plants matured, and the cotton ripened,
and he gave me four samples to take to London.
These were sent to Manchester, the Colonial Institute,
and other places, and they were reported on In'
experts in glowing terms. The cotton, owing to its
long staple, was worth at the time from 7:}d. to 7Jd.
a lb., while wool was then worth about 9d. to lOd.
per lb. The price for both these commodities has
increased very considerably since. At the Church
of England Mission, at Forrest River, all the tropical
plants I saw under cultivation in Nyasaland have
been, and are being, grown; in other words, the
Mission produces millet, kaffir corn, maize, kassava.
ground nuts, sweet potatoes, pineapples, cotton and
vegetables of all descriptions, while the vine which
' produces the loutfa sponge grows in profusion. If
white labor can be profitably employed in this class
of work there is room for 30 millions of people in
North Australia.
This is rough on the theories of Premier Barwell,
But, then, the Bishop knows his North Australia, and
Harwell has only read about it.

“San.” considers a Big City:—
Gov. Nathan’s remarks on infantile mortality in
Brisbane (B. 4/5/’22) cause no surprise to those who
know the conditions under which the children live.
Where Nature is the whole circus these conditions
are good; out in the sunshine and fresh air, even
in the heat of mid-day, there is a tempering breeze
which is pleasant and healthful. But in the
houses, under the iron roofs through which the sun
beats mercilessly, things are very different. The
jaded housewife longs continually for night. Main-
dwellings are built on. wooden stumps to minimise the
white-ant trouble, and underneath there is generally
a tangle of rubbish. It is a common practice to
throw kitchen slops out of the window (often there
are no sinks), and children crawling and play-
ing about under the house, as many of them do, are
not in the best of environments for growing healthy
and strong. These underspaces, moreover, are in-
fested with mosquitoes. If I were Dictator of Public
Health I would move the bulk of Brisbane’s popula-
tion out to some clean bush camp, and put a fire-
stick to the mass of insanitary dwellings that can
be seen in the industrial suburbs. Never even
under the most favorable circumstances were the
wooden walls well eared for, but since the enormous
rise in the cost of materials, painting has become a
distant memory. One can see forests of houses in
the Valley, Red Hill and Petrie’s-terraee that are
simply crumbling away. Stumps are rotting beneath,
and the appallingly flimsy timber walls, which are all
that stand between the average Brisbane!te’s inner life
and a cruel world, are decaying visibly. Add to these
shortcomings the absence of a sewerage system, and
the presence of the übiquitous night-patrol, and there
are all the conditions which account for the slaughter
of innocents in a city which should be one of the
cleanest and healthiest in the world.
It is one of the signs that a Federal election
approaches when this kind of thing begins
to appear in the daily press.
BORDER RAILWAY.
KYOGLE TO BEAUDESERT.
PROPOSED CONSTRUCTION BY COMMON-
AYE ALT II
Brisbane, Friday.—Referring to a statement made
by Mr. Hughes yesterday that the Commonwealth
would build the Kyogle-Beaudesert railway, as it
was part of the unification scheme, the Acting-
Premier, Mr. Gillies, said that, as chairman of the
Royal Commission which had reported so favorably
on the Kyogle-Beaudesert railway, he was very
pleased to know from Mr. Hughes that this was
about to be built. The line, said Mr. Giillies,
would he of great value to Queensland.
Quite a pile of years ago the Queenslanders
carried a coastal line to their southern
border, on the promise that the N. S. Wales
system would connect with it and supply an
alternative and shorter route between Sydney
and Brisbane —good for commerce, but so
exposed on the seaward side as to be none
too reliable for defence purposes. But it
would have given the people of Ma State’s
extreme north-east corner access to a capi-
tal that is COO miles nearer than Sydney, and
viewing this dreadful fact the Holman Gov-
ernment broke away from the agreement and
left an unbridged gap on the border. Queens-
land wants the connection badly. So does
all the northern half of N. S. Wales, and
the rest of the State is willing to take any-
thing that offers cheaply. It has become
habitual to assume an alliance between N. S.
Wales and Queensland on the ground that
they have a common interest in stealing the
S. Australia-N. Territory railway, and now
that the pair command a majority in the Re-
presentatives dodgy party managers of the
Hughes school are naturally much interested
in the block vote of this Little Entente. The
completion of State railways for the benefit of
“PEACE, PERFECT PEACE."
“It is significant that no French Minister met Mr. Lloyd George during his brief stay in Paris, where
he did not leave his railway carriage.”— Cable, 23/5/’22.
THE WELSH HARDIS'T: “It’s the last string—and I can’t say I like the look of it.”
a, State is not a Federal job, and it is a nasty
trick that Westralia, S.A., Victoria and Tas-
mania should carry nearly half the cost of
greasing the portly pig. The Common-
wealth’s business is to make a line through
its own Territory, and, if the Dryberra
metropolis is worth the frequently-mentioned
curse, from that spot to Jervis Bay. But
there are no Federal votes at either place,
and to the pure vote-hunter that kills them
dead.

“Aussie”: “Zozimus” is right (B. 11/5/’22)
re the folly of regarding the Hun as a
scientific super-man, and treating him as
such to the detriment of our own people.
In Sydney when the Great War arrived,
German experts were supervising a difficult
construction job. The men refused to work
under them, and the company, forced to em-
ploy their own staff, completed the job as
satisfactorily and as quickly as if the
foreigners had never been near the place.
They had the blueprints and drawings, and
could interpret them just as a cook does a
recipe. The Morwell briquetting plant
should be erected in the same manner. All
we need are the drawings and specifications
from the other side. There is no need even
to import the steel parts, unless the Austra-
lian working-man is so bigoted as not to take
notice of developments outside his own coun-
try, and keep his own steel mills shut. As
this country is going to require a number of
technical experts as industry expands, we
would do well to look out for our fellow-
Australians abroad and get them to fill the
new jobs, instead of importing men,
whether from England or elsewhere. I
do not care what inducements are offered; it
is most difficult to get a first-class man who
has climbed the ladder to leave his own
country for another. Thus, in our pursuit of
overseas assistance, we inevitably have to fall
back on second-raters. Australian engineers
and chemists abroad are known to their
professional brethren at home, and it is up
to them to keep in touch with one another.
The scientific societies should try and list
these absentees, and when a suitable position
is open, barrack for one of them, if nobodv
in Australia is available. The Aussie who
leaves home is mostly forced to do so by
circumstances, and hopes to return one day
with the advantages of outside experience.
And when he lands in a job again in his own
country, the chances are that he will fill
it to far better purpose than the outsider
who lobs in with a lot to learn and more to
forget.
“Bardolph Bedstead” virtually gives up
hope:—
A fear prevails that no human effort will avail
to put. the Queensland bullock industry fairly on its
hoofs this year. The State Government thought it
had discovered in the cattle business a fine city to
loot. Taxation was about trebled. Railway rates
were pushed up till they performed an Australian
record. Pastoral rents were raised 100 per cent, os-
more, contrary to the terms of the leases, and the
increases being, in many eases, dated back, money
had to be raised in costly ways to meet the unex-
pected demand. The industry had to find-meat ,at
specially low prices to supply the Government meat-
shops, and private owners had to compete against
Government stations which were exempt from State
and Federal taxes. Later, officialdom began to lay
it down that the new-born calf was taxable income.
When bedrock prices came and the squatter began
to slay his property to diminish his income-tax, and
a crash seemed imminent, Prime Minister Hughes
burst upon the scene. He made his entry upside-
down, as usual. In moments of profound emotion
Hughes . always enters walking on his hands. He
didn’t make it a condition that the Brisbane Govern-
ment should develop some signs of sweet-reasonable-
ness. But he stipulated for a small reduction in war
wages, in freezing charges and in shipping- freights.
With an election pending it was no time, perhaps,
to be nasty about railway freights, taxes and steals._
On those terms he undertook, off his own bat, and
with no reference to that obsolete institution called
Parliament, to pay an export bonus on meat that may
add another £300,000 to the stunning deficit. Yet
with it all some of the meatworks may not open
and the rest only in a small way. The huge burdens
remain. A drought has struck the West, and much
beef is hardly worth removing. Also, the squatters
don't regard prosperity as such a great thing, after
all. There is a saying among Turkish tax officials
after they have looted a district bare: “Is there
some blood on the bone? Then scrape it again."
The pashas at Brisbane are like that, and °it is
hardly worth while earning money till thev are
dead. And at the present they are alive and exceed-
ingly hungry.
-
Once more Senator-Minister Pearce on
this country’s “problem”:—
1 do not think that the problem of the development
and settlement of the Northern Territorv by white
people is as hopeless as Senator Fairbairn seems to
think. But 1 recognise that it is a difficult problem,
and that progress will be slow. There is no short
cut to success.
t»ut there is a short cut to the Territory
one which would reduce the distance, south
to north, from 3415 miles to 1818 miles,
Nearly half the work is done—mostly bv
the exertions of the poorest State on the
mainland; and the Commonwealth is pledged
to finish it, and lias accepted lavish pay-
ment in land-grants for linishing it. 8o
this short cut to success might be worth
trying. The “problem” of the Territory,
which has its centre about latitude 20, is
merely the problem of Townsville. Also it
is the problem of Brazil and 13 other Ameri-
can republics, and of Rhodesia, and of ex-
German South-West Africa. One of the
differences between Pearce and the people
of these places is that the latter simply build
their railways and don’t wail. The disaster
of the North is that a long terrace of Min-
istries, with far too many of which Sena-
tor Pearce was connected, instead of treat-
ing the place on simple business lines, have
used it as a sort of botanical garden in
which to grow the same sort of experiments
that Lenin, Trotsky and co. attempted in
Russia. Now the surviving experimenters
must either admit that they were crude,
comic-opera folk, who, being entrusted with
a great estate, practically free of Parlia-
mentary supervision, proceeded to grossly
mismanage it, or they must establish the
theory that there is a Brooding Horror
over the place. Which is what they are
doing. It is an unpatriotic device; biit
then party politicians arc mostly like that.
In the good cause of good roads:—
If the National ltoads Association is fairly repre-
sented by its virile Victorian branch this countrv
will presently be in a way to accommodate much
of the increased population it needs. The other
day the Warrnnmbool section of the Prince’s High-
way was declared open for traffic. A resolution in
favor of nationalising this main artery has been
passed in Bendigo at a conference of Councils inter-
ested in the main road from Mildura. Ballarat
and Horsham are moving resolutely in the cause of
good roads, and in the Goulburn Valley the shires are
enlightening the local world, with the aid of moving
pictures, regarding the road-improvement crusade
at home and abroad. Victoria’s branch of the
association is certainly doing its bit, and putting-
force into its appeal for funds, a lot of practical
work having been accomplished last year with an
expenditure of little more than £lOOO. No popu-
lation can push along much until its roads are well
made and numerous. The rural producer, the city
manufacturer and the merely touring motorist are
united by a bond of mutual advocacy of good roads.
Of course, the question of how to make them waits
upon the question of foresight and unselfish organisa-
tion (versus expediency) in planning the routes. The
original macadamised roads, water “blinded,” served
the requirements of a lighter traffic than we get
these times. Tar is but a temporary means of
keeping dust from arising by holding the road-surface
together. Reinforced concrete appears to be the last
word in durable road material, thus far. Immigration
schemes demand more roads to travel on than Aus-
tralia at present is blessed with. Here is
be done, and in the doing of it not even the .wildest-
eyed Bolshevik will pretend that the interests of Capi-
tal and Labor clash.
«
Compulsory Arbitration is becoming a
jumbled business. In his draft award cover-
ing the pastoral industry, Justice Powers,
of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court,
fixed the shea ring- rate at 30s. a hundred,
and shed-hands’ wages at £3 a week and
keep, cooks being allowed os. per man per
week. These amounts (and there were
others) were lower by 25 and 33 j per cent,
than those awarded in 1920 by Justice
McCawt.ey, of Queensland ; and that gentle-
man, now C.J., promptly announced that the
Queensland award would stand —till Novem-
ber, in any event. He also indulged in some
criticism of the “flaws” in his learned
brother’s “reasoning.” Learned brother, for
his part, admitted a slight miscalculation
and tacked a sixth- on the shearing, rate,
which now stands at 355. a hundred, increas-
ing the pay for other work in proportion.
He likewise spoke coldly of his erudite rela-
tive, and hoped that no harm would come
of the latter’s “hasty” plunge into polemics.
Certainly the Arbitration system is not
helped by the spectacle of Court Presidents
chipping at one another. And whether it
can stand the strain imposed on it by differ-
ent awards in the same industry remains to
be seen.

POLICAL
POINTS.
Departing from the Ministerial custom of
keeping off the grass when Leg. Council
elections are on, Vic. Premier Lawson has
been speaking at Ascot Vale in support of
J. G, Aikman, who wants re-election for
Melbourne West. Williams, a South Melb.
Labor municipalist, is trying to wrest the
job from Aikman, and as Laborite Disney
holds the second seat for the Province, Aik-
man does not feel confident. Hence the call
to Lawson.
“West Sydneyite’s” note :—-
No one ever made a greater certainty of a pocket
borough than Archdale Parkhill did of the new
Federal seat of North Sydney. He had all the offi-
cials of all the Nationalist Leagues in the electorate
pledged to support him long before the selection ; Mrs.
Mackitmon, a North Shore doctor’s wife who is
believed to control the local female anti-Labor vote,
turned up on the day to assure him that he had the
backing of everything conservative in skirts: Pratten
said that the Federal Ministry was behind him, and
Cocks that the State Government was solid. It
was great organising, and made selection a farce and
election a foregone conclusion. But the more Hughes
hears about Bendigo, these days, the less he likes
the news (the latest to terrify him is “Wally”
Marks, M.P., who has been electioneering there
on his behalf all last week), and if the Sydney
dailies bludgeon him into a definite move on the
Canberra issue he will be doomed so far as any
Victorian constituency is concerned. And that is
where Parkhill is likely to crash. He will be
requested to hand over to the P.M., “in the interests
of the cause,” and he will comply—in the spirit of
one of those unpopular officials of old Rome who
imbibed the courteously proffered hemlock.
W. M. Hughes’s new Trade Commissioner
to China hasn’t been operating for a full
year yet, but it is understood that the office
has already cost £20.000 and is growing
fast. The known results, so far, have been
a tentative inouirv about a few apples to be
sent on approbation. The Trade Commis-
sioner to the U.S. cost nearly £13,000 last
year. The visible results are that Uncle
Sam has been loading his goods on us in
record fashion (probably he pumped the
Commissioner about our weak points), but
is excluding harmless Australian visitors
more peremptorily than ever. The Histh
Commissioner, whose work could be done _bv
a bank and a solicitor, cost £75,764, which
is the record to date. The Bureau of Com-
merce and Industry, which cost £1972 a
couple of years ago, ran to £5160, and the
Institute of Science and Industry got away
with £16,042. And the Ambassador at
Washington has still to be appointed.
Only seven of the 18 vacant seats in the
Vic. Council are likely to be contested. Less
interest is taken in this struggle nowadays
than in municipal polls. There was a time
when a large section of the Canadian press
ignored the existence of the Propputy Houses
in that country. And it well may come to
that in Vic.
Littleton Groom’s recent visits to Banana-
land suggest that he is putting in some
quiet electioneering in case of a sudden
appeal to the country. Groom used to think
that he had a reasonably safe seat, but the
growth of Cocky sentiment on the Darling
Downs has induced him to change his
opinion. Anyhow, the Farmers will surely
oppose him, and if they get the right man
—J. F. Morgan, chairman of the Banana-
land Wheat Board, has been suggested—
Littleton will have the fight of his life.
A Victorian judgment of the situation: —
Though Hughes reiterates his intention of sticking
to Bendigo, he still wouldn’t hesitate •4o exchange
it for a safer seat. Good judges, who are able to
appraise the anti-Hughes feeling in the constituency,
reckon that any good local man would make the
Priminister tremble for his majority. In a straight-
out battle Vic. Premier Lawson, for instance, would
beat him easily, but Lawson refuses to oppose
Hughes, partly through personal timidity, but
mostly from fear of widening the Nationalist breach
that has been started by Watt. All the same, Lawson
would nominate if Hughes scurried for shelter else-
where. His old pal Watt is inwardly cursing the
precipitancy of Lawson’s colleague McPhairson in
promising to stand for the new Deakin constituency,
which Watt prefers to Balaclava, owing to its
stronger Tory complexion. Taking it altogether, there
FRIENDLY (?) COUNSEL.
THE LOOKEB-ON: “Now, now! boy, you ain’t big enough for them long pants yet;
They’ll only make yer look redicklous.”
are suspicious possibilities about the Federal situa-
tion in Vic., especially as Jimmy Boyd, another of
Watt’s intimates, threatens to have a try for Henty.
The assertion in a Sydney paper that
Hughes was “met on arival at Murwillumbah
by a big crowd,” and also that he encountered
large ci'&wds at Bangalow and Byron Bay,
recalls the time when Henry Parkes was
accompanied on a country tour by Todd, of
the D.T., a youthful reporter with some Eng-
lish experience. The vain old man had
passed through many small townships Avhere
populations ranging from three to 300 turned
out to catch a glimpse of him as the train
went through. After bowing to a multitude
of 23 he leaned back complacently and said,
“I suppose, Mr. Todd, when Mr. Gladstone
passes through the English towns he has re-
ceptions something like these?” “On a
larger scale, of course, Sir Henry,” said
Todd. “Nothing of the sort. Mr. Todd,”
the veteran fairly screamed at him. “Nothing
of the sort, I tell you.”
From the Federal gallery:—
Now that Frank Anstey has become deputy-leader
of the Labor party in the House of Reps., the popu-
lace will no doubt roll up in greater numbers next
session to see how he will behave. The dignity of an
official position will sit very lightly on Anstey. and
if he ever takes charge of the Opposition when Charl-
ton is absent, no one will regret it more than the
Government. Anstey is alleged to have lost a lot
of his sting, but the next innings in Parliament will
show that his gift of mordant satire is as strong as
ever. Strangely enough, he will often prepare and
•rehearse quite a serious speech on a matter very
near his heart, and then go into the House and forget
all about it, delivering, instead, an extempore oration
full of the devastating sarcasms that seem to spring
to his tongue in the stress of excitement. All his
best things are said in the white heat of passion,
and the best proof that they are pure impromptus
is revealed by his omitting to pause to admire their
brilliancy.
“Land of Wealth” was the heading which
some humorous party on Sydney Tet.egb.apii
put t' an item about the evidence that the
Federal Railways Commision is collecting
in Queensland. A high Queensland official
gave it as his opinion that if the Common-
wealth builds 800 or 900 miles of railway
through West Queensland, where hills, rivers
and minerals are all scarce, the best land
may carry a sheep to seven acres. If that
is wealth what sort of a show is there for
poverty?
“Solomon Malaprop”:—
It was mentioned in The Buei.etin (18/5/’22)
that “the new Parliament has given early proof that
it doesn’t differ in ruffianism from the oId”—N.S.W.
Parliament being always understood when “ruffian-
ism” is mentioned. It is a difficult matter to inter-
fere with poisonous and ruffianly talk, either in
Parliament or the Domain, the theory having become
so deeply rooted that it is a necessary “safety valve.”
But the way to do it is obvious enough. Let “Par-
liamentary privilege” be abolished as between mem-
bers, on the simple ground that a denizen of the
House isn’t necessarily such a coarse, brutish and
beetle-browed hog that he would be ruined in dam-
ages or spend his best years in gaol if required to
keep his foul vocabulary within the same limits as,
say, an editor, a lecturer or the chairman of a
board. After a few of the Old Brigade had been
served by fellow members with writs for £5OOO each,
and a few more with summonses for criminal libel,
the reform would be complete. And the worst speci-
mens would vanish from politics. Shorn of their
vocabulary they would become dumb.
One result of the W.A. Legislative
Council elections was the rejection of
Walter Kingsmill, President of the institu-
tion aforesaid, by the Metropolitan Province
electors. “Kingy,” who is an old Parliamen-
tary hand with a keen eye to the main
chance and as practised a speaker, post-
prandial or ante-polling day, as there is in
W.A., has had rebuffs before —notably when
he was elbowed out of the Ministerial ranks
owing to a suspicion of indolence that had
fastened pn to him —but he never came such
a cropper as this. He has never been beaten
in a State election before, and he has sat,
first in the Assembly and then in the Coun-
cil, since 1897, save for a brief interlude,
when he resigned to lead a forlorn-hope
Liberal sortie for a Federal Senate seat and
was restored to his old perch immediately
afterwards. What may have contributed to
his defeat this time was his refusal to sub-
mit his name to the Nationalist organisation
for endorsement, on the ground that his
Presidential position in the Upper House
required that he should steer clear of party
labels and obligations. Kingsmill has never
been exactly popular, but his Parliamentary
ability is recognised, and there will be a lot
of sympathy felt for him. It may be enough
to float him into the Senate if no other door
opens for him in Groperland.
Whether coal-mining produces swelled
head, or whether the thing just happens, is
uncertain, but the doings of some of the
people who want to be entrusted with sole
control of the nation’s coal supply are funny
enough. Recently the usual dispute arose
between two wheelers at a Newcastle pit,
each wanting to work the same “road.” One
had to have it, and the other displayed his
offended dignity by trottin" alongside with a
high-stepping action. Then the inevitable
strike began because he wasn’t paid for
trotting alongside.
From an Adelaide iconoclast:—
“Hamer’s” statement (B. 4/5/’22) that nobody
foresaw the increased cost of campaigning under
Contortional Misrepresentation may be true as re-
gards N. S. Wales, but is not correct if applied to
B'.A. In that State W. A. Hamilton, M.L.A., the
leading local antagonist of this electoral monstrosity,
has stated repeatedly that, owing to the prodigious
size of constituencies, campaign expenses would be so
heavy as to prevent any but wealthy candidates, or
those having a powerful organisation behind them,
frojn contesting seats. The main points of Hamil-
ton’s attack on the Hare sophistry have been:—
(1) Unwieldy electorates.
(2) The impossibility of properly providing for
casual vacancies.
(3) The system, or alleged system, is clumsy,
inaccurate and dangerous.
(4) Candidates of the same party would fight each
other bitterly for No. 1 votes.
Hamilton’s campaign has been effectual, and P.R. in
the Central State is as dead as the dodo.
“0.K.”: Since somebody called attention to
the fact that the Vic. Tramways Act grants
free passes to members of the Parliament
which passed it, I am wondering whether the
old Tramways Co. gave passes to the members
of yore who presented the co. with its glori-
ously profitable charter. And how about the
Metropolitan Gas Co., and the electric light
■companies? Do they put members of the State
Parliament on their free list? And the water
rates —are members of the State Legislature
absolved from payment of them?
State Treasurer McPherson’s announce-
ment of his intention to contest the Deakin
(Vic.) seat in the House of Reps., provided
the redistribution scheme goes through, will
be an incentive to Hughes to tear up that
document or have it radically altered. Politi-
cians of McPherson’s stamp are not popular
with the Priminister. He prefers mere blobs
like Pearce and Poynton—persons who have
nothing to commend them, save a flunkey-like
reverence for the great man, and who would
be unhappy if he didn’t boss them in his
grand manner. McPherson, a man of ability
who has forgotten more about finance than
Hughes ever knew, has never learned how
to be humble to fretful little autocrats, and
is too old to begin. So the McPhersons
aren’t wanted.
There is small prospect of the present
Vic. Parliament amending the State Consti-
tution in the interests of skirted noli-
ticians. Mrs. Gatehouse, who put the

night, said that State Parliaments were more
“domesticated” than the National Legisla-
ture, and she preferred them on that account.
But the trousered tribunes are not likely
to be won over by glozing ’accusations of
tameness or anything else. They are solid
about keeping both Houses at their present
low ebb of refinement, and until they
glimpse a higher, purer light in this respect
the ladies will have to remain outside, and
so will the parsons. The Constitution bars
them, too.
In the matter of the scarcity, overcrowd-
ing and dilapidation of schools, the State
records range from poor to horrible, while
there are more railways than the people have
payable use for. This is because railways are
loan works and thus handy relief works,
while a certain scruple lingers about charg-
ing ’ free schools .against, interest-hearing
loans. But the Fuller Ministry has appa-
rently taken the plunge and decided to debit
schools to posterity along with everything
else. (Dooley had the same idea, but
failed to get the money.) So N.S.W., av a’l
events, should presently have academies to
burn. “The only way to absorb the unem-
ployed is to build schools” will be the new
“slogan” of Jubhins, M.P.
THE SUPERSESSION OF THE POLITICIAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The late war was directed by Mahatmas, mysteri-
ous entities who favor with their presence the inmost
recesses of Thibet.” — Dr. Annie Besant.
Who won the war? The British? Marshal Foch?
Bosh!
Wilson? Lloyd George? The ships that guard the
main
Whereout Britannia rose? Our deathless slain?
No ! Guess again !
The tanks? The Yanks, that fresh and hefty
throng
All straining in the leash, two millions strong?
Oh, go along!
Who lost the war? Von Hindenburg? The Kaiser
By Junker gulled and sycophant adviser?
I’ll make you wiser!
Where was it won and lost? What battle line
’Twixt Flanders fields and holy Palestine
The issue forced? Some memorable spot
Where the red poppies wave and crosses dot
The scarred champaign—type of a hundred? What
Insensate rot!
Know ’twas no land where serried hosts were set
And earth with shells and blood was seamed And
wet,
But calm, sequestered, mystical Thibet.
Eh? In those frowning wastes no shot was fired?
You make me tired!
Up there, amid the snows, weird folks with wings,
Known as Mahatmas, live, serene old things,
They pulled the strings!
Just as, when valiant Greeks and Trojans tore
At one another in the days of yore
With all the pomp of charioted war,
Zeus and his crowd on dim Olympus sat
Some helping this side and some hindering that,
Till, with the question put to a division,
Came a decision.
Still, then as now, when angry nations quarrel,
High arbiters —less thirsty and immoral
Than those who, ’twixt affaires de ceeur and nectar,
Settled the fate of Paris or of Hector —
Mysterious, venerable entities
Roosting on crags where Polar bears might freeze,
Discuss, decide and ukase, adamant
As their own rocks, what shall be and what shan’t.
(Signed) A. Besant.

Entries in the table since the 1920 balance
have become tangled. Early in that year the
old Standard-Waygood-Hercules' co. an-
nounced that it had entered into partnership
with a group of foremost English electric
interests, which had just amalgamated in a
five-million concern. Under the agreement
the Australian co. changed its name, paid
£lOO,OOO (in shares) to the English group
for rights and agencies, and made 100,000 £1
shares available for subscription by the Eng-
lish co. at ss. per share premium. About
nine months ago it became obvious that the
English concern was not in a position to
exercise its option over these shares: owing
to depression in Britain the big amalgama-
tion had its own troubles. So the agreement
was amended, and the Australian co. secured
all rights by payment of £lO,OOO cash in
place of the £lOO,OOO “A” ordinaries previ-
ously issued. These shares have been sur-
rendered and will lie cancelled when the
necessary authority has been given by share-
holders. The abandonment of the partner-
ship placed on the local co. the burden of
finding all the capital necessary to finance
the extensions of works in hand. The direc-
tors offered £150,000 of 0 p.c. 10-year deben-
tures, convertible into shares after March 31,
1922, but, owing to an unfavorable money-
market, they got only £llB,lOO. In Sep-
tember last they offered £47,520 of ordinary
shares, subscribers being offered one fully-
paid £1 share in Weymouth’s, Ltd., for every
two taken up. The issue was fully subscribed
and the bonus in Weymouth’s, the Melbourne
end of the business, was provided by tapping
the parent’s carry-forward for £23,760. No
dividend was paid at the 1921 balance, the
whole of the cash available having been
required for the construction programme. No
cash was passed out. in the share-bonus; in
effect, it was a straight-out capitalisation of
reserves, the Melbourne subsidiary being
presented with £23,760 of new capital
from the parent’s funds. Nor was
the parent co. called upon to find
the £lO,OOO cash for the English con-
cern under the amended agreement. Not be-
ing permitted by law to traffic in its own
shares, another subsidiary, the Standard-
Waygood (practically wholly owned by the
English Electric of Aus.) has handled that
deal. Therefore, the cancellation of tue
£lOO,OOO of “A” shares entirely expunges
goodwill from the parent’s balance-sheet:
but the £lO,OOO which replaces these shares
will henceforth appear as goodwill in the
S.-W. accounts.
The English Electric of Aus. subsidiaries
consist of (1) Weymouth’s, a successful old
Melbourne business, which was acquired by
the Standard-Waygood-Hercules co., and
which will continue a separate existence, but
operate on behalf of the parent in Vic.; and
(2) Standard-Waygood, Ltd., a retention of
portion of the old concern which will attend
to electric-lift installations and mainte-
nance. The co. also has a holding in Auto-
matic Telephones, Ltd. Shares in these
three concerns have a book value of £86,757,
but the £lO,OOO of goodwill in Standard-
Waygood is “the only item of that descrip-
tion among all assets.” The introductory
table shows how profitable were operations
for many years. The co. also did well dur-
ing the past 12 months, and a 10 p.c. div. is
recommended by the directors, but it is
proposed to defer payment of half of it until
mid-December. Though the former very pro-
fitable enterprises are still retained, the Eng-
lish Electric is a concern very different from
the old Standard-Waygood-Hercules. Having
acquired the rights, plans, specifications anu
agencies of the group of English manufac-
turers, the co. is seeking to manufacture in
Australia heavier electric gear which has
hitherto been imported. This comparison
shows how rapidly new funds have been
raised and how the money has been spent:

In Sydney all branches of the business,
except lift-repair operations, have now been
centralised at the new Clyde works. There,
plant superior to any other in the Southern
Hemisphere has been installed, and the Eng-
lish Electric of Aus. is now efficiently
equipped to manufacture practically all lines
of heavy electrical gear and is already turn-
ing out work, such as turbo-generators, never
before attempted in the Commonwealth. Un-
fortunately the works have been built at top
cost, and at a time when prices overseas have
rapidly declined, while local costs are almost
as high as ever. The co.’s present difficulty
is to find profitable work for plant. The co.
is not receiving the encouragement the enter-
prising management has deserved: electric
users, mostly Government or semi-public
bodies, have not hesitated to rush orders
overseas to cheap-labor countries, though
never before has it been more necessary to
keep every penny in the Commonwealth. A
particular Government enterprise may profit
by buying in cheaper markets overseas; but
the country is the poorer in the long run.
Orders placed outside deprive the workers of
wages and restrict the operations of the
various manufacturers and producers whose
services and capital would be employed
locally. Having erected and efficiently
equipped modern works and acquired rights
to world’s accepted designs in electric gear,
the position of the English Electric of Aus-
tralia is a matter to which the Tariff Board
might give earnest attention. Though the
co.’s manufacturing prospects are, at the
moment, in doubt, its electric-lift and other
activities should continue to give good
returns, and agency arrangements should
keep the wolf from tin* door until reduction
of local costs, or tariff assistance, give the
manufacturing end of the business a chance.

Disclosed profits were a few hundreds less
than for the previous year. Though that
trifling falling-off is of no consequence, there
are reasons why latest profits should have
been smaller. Business on the books at the
balancing dates helps to explain :

Owing to choked markets and the flood of
imports advances 12 months ago were unusu-
ally large: and as these loans were gradu-
ally repaid the Bank of Adelaide decided to
hold on to the cash and strengthen its posi-
tion. So at the latest balance there was
£698,000 less on which customers were pay-
ing interest. All that and a bit more, how-
ever, had been invested in Treasury-bills
and other Government securities, which, of
course, are not so profitable as advances.
On the other hand, it is doubtful whether, at
the latest balance, the management had to
draw on a penny of its earnings to provide
for any depreciation of gilt-edged securities:
in previous years there were fairly heavy
calls in that respect.
A feature of the latest accounts is that
deposits have grown to record dimensions.
Deposits held in March, 1921, were £395,000
less than those of 12 months before, owing
chiefly to the withdrawal of Government
money; but at the latest balance the figures
had moved ahead £560,000. However, the
total of all liabilities is now much the same
as it was a year ago, bills payable being
almost a half-million less owing to cus-
tomers now remitting to London by cable
instead of settling with currency-bills.
The Bank of Adelaide’s business is of
comfortable dimensions: funds total nearly
£1,300,(XX), and all outside liabilities
£6,903,259. The bank thus holds £5 6s. of
the public’s money for every £ of its own
funds. It could handle half as much again
before what is generally regarded as a pru-
dent limit of trading would be reached. The
Bank of Adelaide’s position in this respect
was strengthened two years ago by £125,000
of new capital got in. Paid capital is now
£625,000, on which latest profits gave a
return of 14.8 p.c. So 10 p.c. divs. are paid
with ease, though the large reserves —they
exceed capital by £47,000 —make that div.
rate possible. On total funds profits give
a return of slightly more than 7 p.c.
At the latest balance Adelaide’s bank had
almost £3 of every £5 of the public’s money
in cash or assets readily convertible into cash.
In view of all the demands for accommo-
dation from the banks, such strength in the
liquid position is surprising, though March is
between seasons, and from now onwards the
volume of advances will expand until the
current year’s marketing of products com-
mences. Still, the big reduction of the
figures compared with 12 months ago hints
that the Bank of Adelaide management is
not encouraging the man who wants to work
on other people’s money. The £2,816,130 of
liabilities not covered by liquid assets at
March 31 was supported by £3,991,579 of
advances, and premises with a book value
of £153,114.

Garratt’s, Ltd., motor-car importers, etc.
(Sydney).—At the January, 1921, balance
there was £93,121 of paid capital. For the
12 months covered by the latest accounts a
net loss of £45,659 is shown, equal to almost
half the capital with which the co. opened
its financial year. The 1921 accounts showed
the concern to he in a very uncomfortable
position: in previous years difficulty had
been experienced in securing adequate stocks,
but in the 1921 period overseas manufac-
turers put the accelerator on deliveries, and
when stock-taking time came round Alick
McNeil found £200,000-odd of cars and acces-
sories on hand or on the way. Meantime
the co. was committed to a building pro-
gramme, and the period closed with liabili-
ties exceeding £173,000. The Bulletin
remarked 12 months ago that the co.’s future
depended mostly on its success in unload-
ing the huge stocks. Garratt’s luck was out.
But. the £45,000 loss now shown was not
wholly incurred in the 12 months covered
by the accounts to January 31. The audi-
tors’ certificate was not given until towards
the end of last month, and prior to that the
management made another tally of stocks,
wrote them down to latest replacement value,
and in the published accounts included assets
held at January 31 at the written-down
values.
Though the co. was badly hit by having
to reduce prices on three occasions to
find purchasers for its large and costly
stocks, shareholders can feel thankful that
the concern is still afloat and not in the
hands of a liquidator. Had a period of
severe depression accompanied falling prices,
Garratt’s might easily have been still left
with the expensive stocks. Fortunately, the
Commonwealth’s spending capacity was not
curtailed to any extent, and buyers have
been found at the lowered prices. The man-
agement reports that total turnover for the
three months to April this year was £64,209.
an improvement of £6641 on the figures of
the same period in 1921.
Paid capital in 1917 was only £20,552,
but to finance a programme of works exten-
sions it expanded in this way: 1919.
£40.893; 1920, £63,678; 1921, £93.121;
1922, £107,045. Profits have been as follows
since 1912, when, after having gone £7OOO
to the bad in three years, the management
was reorganised

1915.. 4329 I 1918.. 7027 1921.. 9071
No div. was distributed when the 1921
accounts were presented, and after paying
taxes, etc., £22,471 lay in reserve. Deduct-
ing this amount from last year’s £45,659
loss, P. and L. account is in debit £23,188.
And the co.’s position is shown in this com-
parison :

Cash, etc. .. 773 1,049 9,475 2,708
No doubt sales since the balance at Janu-
ary 31 have improved the co.’s position, but
assuming that all troubles with respect to
stocks have been overcome, the future de-
pends a good deal on the employment which
the co. can find for its body-buildina: and
repair works, into which so much capital
has been nut. Liabilities are still very
heavy: £69.614 of the indebtedness is a bank
overdraft secured by debenture and a first-
mortgage over properties, and the manage-
ment has had to borrow £9474 more on
second-mortgage. Goodwill still figures _in
the balance-sheet at £4622; so, allowing
cover for the £lOOO of 6 p.c. cum. prefs. got
in some years ago, the £100,045 of ordinary
capital is now represented by £79,875 of
net tangible assets, or less than 15s. per
share. To wipe out the P. and L. deficit
will take at least two years, assuming that
the co. can earn 10 p.c. p.a. on capital.

Less than 20 years ago Union Trustee
was paying onlv 4 p.c. on £78,822 of paid
capital. Divs. were gradually improved,
and meantime the margin of surplus profit
grew, so nowadays 10 p.c. is being paid with
ease on £llO,OOO of capital, and though
£lO,OOO of it is transferred profit reserves
now exceed £28,000. The Union was the
first trustee co. to extend operations outside
its home State: headquarters are in Victoria,
and there are branches in N. S. Wales and
Queensland. The, extent of the co.’s trust
business is not disclosed, but the introduc-
tory table and the one which follows show
how rapidly the concern has grown:—

Business is more expensive to handle than it
used to be: in 1915 exes, took 56 p.c. of
gross income, last year almost 72 p.c*. How-
ever, operations have .so expanded that the
co. continues to improve the return o,n capi-
tal; latest profits are equal to 12f p.c. On
capital and reserves combined the return is
just 10 p.c.
There are 100,(XX) shares of £2 10s. each,
and besides the £llO,OOO called up there is
£40,000 at the directors’ command, and a
reserve liability of £1 per share (£100,000)
in the event of winding-up. These and the
reserves of £28,000-odd provide the protec-
tion for clients should losses result from

Bankers and Traders’ Insurance Co-
Ltd. —This co., an offshoot of the Queensland
Insurance, commenced business early in 1921.
The Queensland had been operating in North
America for some years through the Mon-
treal Trust, which was really the Royal
Bank of Canada. This influential backing
brought good business. But the Australian
co. must often have had doubts whether it
could continue to hold this business perma-
nently by agency arrangement. At the sug-
gestion of the Queensland Insurance the
Montreal Trust agreed to a partnership.
Burns-Pliilp also became interested, and these
three parties put up most of the £75,000
capital—lso,ooo £1 shares paid to 10s. —
with which the Bankers and Traders’ began.
The co. has had a successful initiation:
for the 12 months to March 31 £22,358 of
net premiums were collected. Losses
amounted to £7605, and expenses—including
all preliminary and flotation charges and
office equipment costs —took £BBB4. In-
terest earnings gave £3169, so the first year
closed with a surplus of £9039 —not wholly
“profit,” as that, surplus was subject to
claims on unexpired risks. It represented
44 p.c. of the year’s net premiums, and,
given normal losses, should have been
adequate for all claims likely to arise from
uncompleted contracts. In view of the fact
that all establishment exes, have been pro-
vided out of revenue, that has been a splen-
did achievement. Besides its Canadian con-
nection, the Bankers and Traders’ now has
its own branches in London, Adelaide and
Perth, and is represented elsewhere by
Queensland Insurance connections, which no

Pioneer Wood Pipe has many advantages over
metal pipe. That is why it features so prominently
in the specifications of progressive engineers. The
greater durability of wood and the fact that it
may not be corroded by fluids make it especially
desirable as a clean, sanitary conduit for water.
The saving on upkeep alone means a big economy.

r, Australasian manager of the North

exception to Tiie Bulletin’s statement last
week that the Insurance Office of Australia
ls definitely going out of business.” Actu-
ally, of course, the 1.0. A. is to continue a
separate existence, though at least 95 pc.
of the shares will be held by the North
Butish. The effect of the “amalgamation,”
however, will be that, since practically all the
profits go to the North British, the Insurance
Gthce of Australia will no longer be an Aus-
tralian-owned concern, but merely a sub-
sidiary of an English co.
...or ,?■ , W *}J es Mines department has just
published Government Geologist E. 0.
Andrews ‘Geology of the Broken Hill Dis-
trict, a comprehensive volume of 400 pages
giving results of the re-survey of the field wh ch
was begun in 191 S at the request of the cos.
A good deal of space is devoted to an excel-
lent account of the history of the Barrier,
previous geological work and descriptions of
individual mines. Every aspect of the geo-
logy ot the field is comprehensively dealt with
and the conclusions arrived at will be of
gieat value not only to tile cos. now operat-
ing on the held but for smaller concerns and
tribute parties. Public interest iu Mr An-
draws report centres in the section dealing
with the future of mining generally and of
individual mines. So far 33 million tons ore
worth approximately £ll2 000,000, has been
laised, and 20 millions have been distri-
buted in divs. At the end of 1917 ore re-
serves were estimated at 13,000,000 tons, to
which slight additions have since been made,
ihese estimates, Mr. Andrews points out, are
very conservative, and in some of the large
nines actua l proved reserves are probably
one-fifth larger than admitted. After closely
studying the geology he records that the
laws of symmetry suggest that an addi-
tional five to six million tons may be “esti-
mated conservatively,” and that “there
should be a high expectancy of 20,000,000
tons, of ore from the Broken Hill line of
foy e * .)\ith. a production of three-quarters
or a million tons per annum Mr. Andrews
therefore confidently anticipates a further
life of at least 26 years for Broken Hill,
assuming, of course, that ore reserves to-day
may be considered to be ore reserves, in say,
10 years. The Volume, which is excellently
produced by the Government Printer, is
available for the public at two guineas.

Prior to his departure for London W. H.
Vv oodhead, of the British B. H., received an
assurance from the Minister for Customs
that the Federal Government had no inten-
tion of enforcing the embargo placed upon
the free export of metals and ores. Confirma-
tion of this attitude was given last week by
the Government in reply to a request from
I ort Ivembla that the exportation of copper
ores shoqld be prohibited. The Government’s
policy is, therefore, quite clear: first it en-
acts that no ore shall be freely exported;
secondly it says the enactment will not be
acted upon. The Minister asserts the em-
bargo is allowed to stand merely to enforce
registration of the exportation through the
Metal Exchange. The Bulletin does not
believe m the exportation of ores that
can be treated locally, neither does it
believe in humbug. The Federal Govern-
lrL?nt s humbug has produced a condition of
allairs under which it is practically impos-
sible to treat copper ores locally and until
loca! works are confronted with the spectre
ot tree exportation the position will not be
remedied. Registration through the Metal
Exchange means, amongst other things, that
every exporter of ores has to reveal the
terms of his bargain with the oversea buyer.
VV ho is it connected with the Metal Exchange
who wants to know these terms?

Sydney got excited about South Lucknow
last week, and on the strength of unofficial
leports from the mine there was a scramble
for scrip and the 3s. 6d. contribs. paid to
sixpence changed hands at as high as 12s.
T. 1 - But the mine position was very little
ciiuereiit from that recorded by The Rulee-
-1 T . N .l f° r tnight ago. It is questionable
whether many buyers understand the pro-
position even now. Certainly they have had
no guidance from the dailies, which have
show* a lamentable ignorance, both of the
field and of the company. The lesson learnt
in the Federation and Mt. Owen deMcle
last year has promoted various warnings
about cornerings and squeezes, but probably
no crowd of shareholders in a mining float
of recent years has been less concerned about
happenings in Pitt-street. Most of the
originals are holding scrip tightly, and the
absence of a flood of paper is probably to
some extent responsible for the high market.
Anyhow, the market gamble is only a side-
line of a legitimate mining enterpuse. At
the beginning of tins week no definite body of
pay ore had been located. All that is
clear at present is that there are most en-
couraging prospects, despite the prominence
which has been given to Mines Department
assays of one and two ’weights over the
widths of the north and south sides of the
shaft, Development work to date has, how-
ever, definitely proved the existence in the
South Lucknow of all the factors which
were associated with the rich finds in the
old Lucknow field. Further development
alone can establish whether those high
values will repeat in South Lucknow.
Apparently the co.’s shaft has not en-
countered the contact. Warnford Lock
25 years ago declared that the primary
source of gold was to be sought in the
quartz veins in the vicinity of the joint.
His experience was that pay values nevei 1
extended many feet along the quartz veins
which make into the joint. Latest news
from the field is that crosscutting for the
joint has commenced, and within a few days
the future of the co. should be more definitely
established. The good values in the vein
and the couple of ’weights recorded in the
bulk assay by the Mines Department may
be of no worth beyond establishing the
association of the precious metal with the
favorable factors discovered: values got so
far are evidently on the spur and not in
the ore-body from which Lucknow gave its
wealth in the past.
A good deal of misconception exists as to
the co. which is working the South Luck-
now. It began as a vigorous Syndicate,
mostly of AY ester,n storekeepers who were
anxious to see the old field revived,
to prospect on the south-eastern exten-
sion on lines recommended by the N. S.
AY ales Geological Survey. After disappoint-
ments, the syndicate, with Government aid,
definitely proved favorable conditions, but by
the time first colors were got the syndicate’s
funds were practically exhausted. It was
then decided to convert into a no-liability
co. to raise the necessary cash. It was a
clean float in which the syndicate laid down
an ideal: “the money invested will be spent
below ground on mining work and not frit-
tered away in big salaries to officials and
costly office and useless surface expendi-
ture.” For purposes of the float, the 40
acres of leases in which 3000 ft. of virgin
joint was thought to exist were valued at
£OOO per acre (£24.000), and development
work, on which £lOOO had been expended,
was valued at £3soo—a total of £27,500.
The syndicate holders got 97,500 3s. Gd.
fully-paids and 90.000 paid to 2s. (together
£20.002) for these assets, and the balance
of the scrip (£1437) was allotted to direc-
tors, etc., for services, the float establishing
the unique principle of no gold no fees. The
100,000 contribs., payable Gd. on allotment,
and now the counters in the market gamble,
were first offered the syndicate-holders. The
issue was over-subscribed by the syndicate,
so actually the contribs. ' were .also the
vendors, and, except in a few instances in
which the syndicators parted with the scrip
to friends, the public has not got into South
Lucknow except via the Pitt-street gamble.
B. 11. Block 14 came through the last
six months £3932 to the bad, but it owed
only £509 and had £9329 owing to it. Other
assets are stores, etc., £7154, and cash
£2llO. Shares in other cos. are stated at
£11,735, but they possibly include a wad of
the defunct King Island Scheelite. All
Block 14 says about the outlook at Broken
Hill is that it hopes the Technical Commis-
sion will help it get the rough corners shaved
off the Edmunds award. Meantime, no man
is employed who can be done without. That
may be so at the mine, but why keep five
on the Board to mop up fees when two live
men and A r oss Smith could run such a limn
show?

A party of seven, all experienced, hard-
bitten prospectors, under Captain Jones, left
Ivalgoorlie the other day to prospect a strip
of auriferous country about 00 miles wide,
running from east of Laverton to a point
about 50 miles east of Ivalgoorlie. The narty
is out for not less than six months and not
exceeding 12 months : after that the engage-
ment runs from month to month. The Gov-
ernment is assisting the party by finding
everything in connection with transport,
tools and camp equipment, in addition to
which the leader receives £7 per week, each
member of the party £2 per week and £1
per week goes to dependants. All hands are
to share equally in any discovery.

Golden Hope, Hampton Plains, has opened
up its 100 ft. level for a length of nearly
300 ft. For this distance the reef averages
54in. width, and goes between 12dwt. and
15dwt. Such results are encouraging, and
justify further developmental work, particu-
larly at depth. AAOien. Hampton Plains was
first worked in a big way 25 years ago
values, such as they were, generally petered
out below 100 ft. Much the same features
accompanied developments on White Hope
and Celebration. In view of this fact sup-
porters of Golden Hope would be well
advised to await the result of developments
at greater depth before becoming too opti-
mistic regarding the mine’s future.
During April Gnow’s Nest (W.A.) treated
1100 tons for £4030. Down to 80ft. pros-
pects are excellent,, but the doubt is
as to what is below, The latest offi-
cial progress report states that the drive
lias been extended 20ft. north and 20ft. south
from the main crosscut at the 180 ft. level.
The reef in the north drive is 4ft.
wide and carries "good values.” The reef
is reported to be wider than the drive to
the south, its full width reef not yet being
ascertained. Average values in this drive,
it. is stated, have been maintained. Two
winzes have been sunk 50ft. in "good grade
ore” from No. 1 towards 180 ft. level. As
80s. is being asked for shares, something-
more appears to be due to prospective buyers
than such vague terms as "good” atid "aver-
age” values and “good grade ore.”
Mt. Cuthbei't (Q.) is in the deepest ditch
it has ever rolled into ill its wobbly career.
Not long since it couldn’t pay its "bankers.
Now it ought to meet its debenture debt, but
that is impossible. And Denison Miller
is not inclined to let the co. have any more
rope. Almost every copper-mine is in trouble
with the inetal at present prices, and as
interest has so far been paid regularly it
doesn’t matter to the Commonwealth Bank
and other debenture-holders whether they let
Figgott go on trying to pull the show out
of the mud or give him another two years’
run. Holders have had 2s. 6d. per share
extracted from them in the last 13 months,
but that has only bettered the position of
the Commonwealth Bank. Hampden’s lap
is spread to catch Cuthbert If the bank shuts
it down, and Corbould wants the mines even
worse.
Mining is looking even duller at Charters
Towers (Q.) lately. Clark’s has been the
only mine of note during the past five years.
The rather promising show out Mount Ley-
shon way, the Wamola, has been sunk on
for 100 ft., but has proved so far only a pros-
pectors’ show owing to the disappointing
narrowness of the vein, The No. 2 Victory
and the other Queenton prospects are more
or less duds, and the situation at Clark’s has
rather depressed the mining fraternity on
the Towers, while shareholders have not col-
lected since last September, after having had
a diet of 3d. or 6d. dividends doled out every
three or four months regularly. • In the
first place the cash spent on opening up the
Moonstone reef has not brought to light
anything worth while. The sink of the shaft
and the No. 12 level has not so far revealed
anything payable, and there is a lot of dead-
work ahead to see if the Small shoots in the
levels just above go down to No. 12. Con-
sidering its size Clark’s has had a great run,
and those who bought in for 2d. a share in
1914 have drawn Bs. 6d. since. Last month’s
crushing dropped 9dwt. a ton below that for
March. The April figures were 269 tons
crushed for 3390 z., or 25dwt. a ton. That
is no good for Clark’s, for working costs,
apart from the cost of recent exploration,
are high ; the workings are now down over
1000 ft. on a narrow reef, where a lot of dead
work has to be done to reach the ore shoots.
Whereas the last crushing was worth just
over £4 a ton, Clark’s ore in its halycon
days used to run to £2l or £22.
Scottish Gympie is now concentrating on
the Inglewood reef from Nos. 7 to 12 levels
with three full shifts. About 140 men are
on the pay-roll at present, and the manager
is still maintaining an average of sdwt to
6dwt. i A large crushing went through the
mill during April. The return showed 3000
tons of ore for 9460 z. valued at £3150. As
the month’s total for the field was 8013 tons
crushed, it can easily be seen what the Scot-
tish means to Gympie at present.
* * * *
After re-organisation at Jibbenbar (Q.),
the State arsenic-mine is again going strong,
but all the old hands have not found places.
The first clean-up since resumption is now
due, and it should pan out at about 180 tons.
It is understood that the continuance of the
scheme for selling the stuff to the cocky for
£lO a ton is in the melting-pot, and that the
Minister may decide to launch out as a State
manufacturer of pear noison. During opera-
tions last year it was costing about £55 a
ton to turn out the white arsenic, so Cocky
was in clover.
* * # *
On the Oaks field (N.Q.) the Consoli-
dated, which amalgamated the Oaks and
Thompson’s Oaks, is going slow until costs
show signs of coming down. Meantime,
several tribute parties are at work and the
co. is getting its plant into good order ready
for a fresh start. The State battery, equipped
with latest concentrating appliances, is now
at work, and the field is awaiting- with in-
terest what saving in gold will be effected.
Some of the local people predict that within
a year the battery will close for want of
ore and because crushing charges will be
too heavy for the low-grade field.
According to manager Kennedy, Kalnm
pang Trong s pup, is somewhat a dud w
was its illustrious parent. Fifty-three acres
down-stream cannot be reached until the
plant is dismantled and carried to where it
can dredge against the current. To make
the pilgrimage would cost £11,400. That
lsn t thinkable with tin low and a small area
to work. So, with the consent of J. B David
the co. scoops in his next-door property of
oOS acres for £15,000 cash and 30,000 fully,
paid £1 shares. This deal means A
new co.—the Kuala Lumpur. It «-ill

shares, and not less than 150,000 arp

“Henry II.”: The frequent recurrence of
the name Leadbeater, a Sydney bishop of
sorts, the last few days, reminds me that
there has probably never been a man named
Wifebeater, though the practice w T as for-
merly as common as Smith. I have been
told that the name Woman was found, once
at least, in the London directory. It sounds
strange. Only a woman would be named
Woman, and she would change her name at
marriage. If her son was born out of wed-
lock he would surely have sense enough to
alter his moniker to Mann.

A friend’s note :
“Bob’’ Lenehan, solicitor, soldier and sportsman,
died in a private hospital in Sydney last Saturday,
lie had been suffering from dropsy for nearly a
year, and was 57 when the end came. lie started
in business as an attorney with Ambrose Pratt.
Then the S’African War came, and Lenehan went to
it. He was a horn soldier, and did great work in
the field until the episode of the shooting of the
Boer prisoners, for which Harry Morant and his
comrades paid with their lives. Lenehan, then a
captain, was nowhere near when the shooting took
place, and was only held responsible in any way
on the military ground that a superior is to blame
for the deeds of his subordinates. But fighting-men
were disciplined on Prussian lines in those days, and
Lenehan got what was to be known in a later war as
“an Aussie.” He had to put in several years’ strenu-
ous work before a Parliamentary investigation cleared
his name and gave him hack his military rank and
seniority. He tried hard to get to the World War
in a combatant capacity, hut Kitchener, who had
not forgotten the episode of 15 years earlier, blocked
him. He served as C.O. of training camps, first at
Holdsworthy and later at Menangle, and though a
disciplinarian of the old school, was extremely popu-
lar. He was a great horseman and a greater horse-
master, and the baekbloekers found him a refreshing
change from some of their superior officers. Two
sons, Maurice and Eric, served in France, the latter
dying shortly after lie was invalided home.
Australian war-graves director Major
G. L. Phillips has stepped into the
more permanent job of inspecting-officer
under the British Graves Commission. Phil-
lips got a nasty packet from Fritz, and he
has carried on his administrative work in
spite of recurring physical discomfort. As
he is now to look after the Somme area he
will still be able to keep an eye on most of
the Aussie graves in France.
George Taylor, the Westralian Speaker,
was 61 on May 16, and spent part of his
birthday at The Bulletin office, seeing old
friends. Born at Campbelltown (N.S.W.),
he went to Bananaland as a youth, was an
early member of the A.W.U., and suffered
imprisonment for his share in the 1891
shearers’ strike. Crossing over to Westralia
he prospected for gold in the North Cool-
gardie district, but had better luck in poli-
tics. The most vigorous and picturesque of
the five Labor members elected to the W.A.
Parliament in 1901, Taylor is the only one
still on deck, Mount Margaret having been
faithful to him at eight elections.
“Coot”: “T.0.1.’5” review of Vic. Police
Commissioners (B. 11/5/’22) recalls that
William Westgarth in his “Early Mel-
bourne” says Lauehlin Mackinnon (of the
original Argus Wilson and Mackinnon) just
missed being the first Commissioner. In
1852 Mackinnon and Westgarth went to the
Bpeck as anti-transportation delegates, and
on the way over one of a number of convicts
aboard robbed a digger of his gold. The
thief went below, where, surrounded his
chums, no one was game to tackle him. When
Mackinnon heard of it he went straight
down, dragged the man from among his
mates, and peremptorily ordered him to
restore the gold. Cowed by such valor the
convict restored the loot. Upon returning to
Melbourne Westgarth mentioned the episode
to Edward Wilson—then owner and editor
of the Argus— and they agi-eed that Mac-
kinnon was just the man required as head
of the police; b#when they went to put
the matter to Captain Lonsdale, Chief Sec-
retary, they found that William 11. F. Mit-
chell had just been given the job. Wilson
thereupon invited Mackinnon to join him in
the Argus venture.
“First Divvy”:—
That Bulletin par. about the advertisement-chasing
Sydney barristers moved me to an acquiescent grin.
You all know Squiggers, the eminent family solicitor.
Failing complete illiteracy, stoneblindness or incar-
ceration in one of those Government institutions from
which the daily press is excluded, there is practically
no escape from Squiggers and his manifold activi-
ties. You know of his dahlias, parentage and off-
spring, of his affection for daffodils, dogs and Dig-
gers, of his achievements at tennis, his skill as an
amateur carpenter, his love for the Mountains (“Mr.
It. B. Squiggers, of the well-known firm of attor-
neys, is in residence at Leura, where he is taking-
advantage of the bracing Mountain breezes to con-
centrate on a coming cause celebre ”): you know
that he is a keen surfer, an earnest Christian, an
opponent of Lenin, an upholder of Lloyd George—the
evening papers, several of whose reporters are, accord-
ing to his enemies, “in the bag,” reveal these and
many other details, with astonishing zest. The
other morning I got out of the train with Squiggers
and struck on the station one who was my major
at Tor Top, and again near Morlancourt. Sqnig-
gers, after one glance at my friend, drew away as
though revolted. “I’m sorry to see you consorting
with a man like that,” he said, as my old O.C.
passed on. “Are you aware that the fellow is an
advertising dentist?”
“T.W.”: Phil Holdsworth, travelling
inspector of the llughe.s-Larkin shipping-line,
who has just come back from England to
look at the Australian end, is son of poet P.
.T. Holdsworth, who wrote “My Queen of
Dreams” and was once an eminent Sydney
knut —or masher, as they called it in his
day. His frock coat, high hat and spats were
the pride of Potts Point, but were regarded
with suspicion by Victor Daley and his
merry crew. The old man’s well-cut mantle
has not descended on his son, who lias too
much to do finding coal and other provender
for Larkin’s boats to bother about his tailor-
ing.
“Fax”: Success came comparatively easily
to the late Leslie Ward, whose series of
caricature portraits for Vanity Fair
accounted for his knighthood. Born and
bred in the art circle, “Spy” Ward had more
than an ordinary inherited artistic tempera-
ment. His mother’, herself a painter, was
the grand-daughter of an R.A., and her
grandfather had a brother who was an R.A.
likewise. Further, Leslie was the son of
E. M. Ward —vine of the most self-taught
academicians in the business 70 years ago
—whose “Josephine Signing Her Divorce
Warrant,” or words to that effect, hangs in
a vestibule at Melbourne National Gallery,
and, incidentally, is gradually enveloping it-
self in gloom owing to the instability of its
pigments.
“Gent. One” on N.S.W.’s Marathon libel
suit:—
W. A. Holman set the seal on his fame as a great
ease-winning barrister by his handling of the plain-
tiff’s side of Meagher v. the National Advocate at
Bathurst (N.S.W.) last week. He has some-
thing of the grand air of the old school of
advocate —a manner which may be witnessed in its
highest expression still when such silks as Edward
Mitchell and Owen Dixon are in court. He is all
suavity and kindliness —or so he appears to
the litigant with whom he is dealing. Win-
deyer, who led for the Advocate, features a
cruder manner. Figuratively speaking, he hitches
up the bowyangs and spits on his honest toil-worn
hands before tackling the enemy. It is effective
with some; but it failed with “Mick” Meagher—an
extremely quick-witted man of the world who has been
everywhere, met nearly everyone, and read everything
worth while in his time. After the plaintiff’s cross-
examination had been in progress for a few hours
the Bathurst natives used to invite one another to
the court “to hear Mick cross-examining the bloke
from Sydney.” BBth Windeyer and Holman made
admirable addresses, and Justice Ferguson told then,
so. Ferguson’s own summing-up was a masterpiece oi
close reasoning, delivered in fine, nervous English ; but
this brilliant man is in a sense too honest to disclose
the true judicial mind in action. Every now and
then he strikes a suit in which he becomes
satisfied as to the locality of the merits long
before the jury pronounces on the matter. When
that happens he cannot hide his views. It did eo
at Bathurst, and was of assistance to the Meagher
faction.
Dr. CUNNINGHAM, who edits the
Melbourne Argus.
“Lanark”: Three decades ago Archdeacon
Julius, of Ballarat, became Bishop of Christ-
church (M.L.) in succession to Bishop
Harper, and to-day he is Primate and first
Anglican Archbishop of M.L.. He always
opposed any change in the title of the head
of the C. of E. in Maoriland, and generally
carried the Synod with him, but this time
he was out-voted, and in accepting the
Primacy he couldn’t very well refuse the
title that went with it. Julius is a sturdily-
built man with little of the clerical look
about him beyond his garb, and in the old
days one of the sights of Christchurch was
his Ludship careering through the streets
on a motor-cycle in full episcopal war-paint.
“Rienzi” : Hughes, who has been talking
about special legislation directed against
caricaturists who defame his countenance,
is not alone in his objection to the black-
and-white tribe. I remember another eminent
statesman who once appeared in a Bill Dyson
picture, which with all its irreverence pos-
sessed a devastating veracity. The great man
sought out the artist, taking the offending
drawing with him. When he found Bill in
his studio he waved the depraved likeness in
the face of his tormentor and shouted : “My
God, sir. this is impious!” “Tut. tut”
answered the imperturbable cartoonist, ' I
only continued where the Creator left off.
Henry Selfe, engineer-surveyor, who went
out recently at 80, was brother of the late
Norman Selfe, the bridge builder. The^ father
of the Selfes was drowned in the Nepean,
near Norton’s Basin, and is buried in the old
Mulgoa churchyard.
Died on S.A.’s “West Coast” at 87, the
other day, Daniel Morgan, a Welsh engineer
who came to Australia in ’5B. After a Gee-
long engagement and a turn on the Vie. gold-
fields he moved on to 8.A., helped to build
the Glenelg jetty, and did a lot of River
Murray trading. There was an interlude in
M.L., as steamboat engineer during the Maori
War; then he came back to Adelaide, and
was engaged in dredging the Port River till,
at the end of the century, he retired to a
farm.
“Lexite”: A London death that will mean
a few mourners in Australia is that of J. B.
Pinker, one of the leading literary agents in
the Fog, who handled the stuff of most Aus-
tralians who have made assaults upon the
English market.
“J.F.H.” (Lond.) : The Inky Way has
been astonished to learn that James Green-
wood, a famous penman of the past, known
as “The Amateur Casual,” is still alive,
approaching his century and living in strait-
ened circumstances. Everybody thought he
had passed out long ago. He specialised in
disguising himself as a tramp, and was thus
able to describe life in the underworld at
first hand. He had an Australian imitator
in Julian Thomas, “The Vagabond,” of Mel-
bourne Argus.
THE BLOKE’S LAMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“Admirers of his brilliant and typical Australian
work will learn with pleasure that Mr. C. J. Dennis,
famous as the creator of ‘The Sentimental Bloke,’
has been specially engaged to conduct a daily column
for the Melbourne Herald.”
’Struth! me faith in me creator, ’im as also made
Doreen,
Has dissolved an' left me weepin', like the snows I
never seen —•
Them virgin snows of yester-year, whereoi'f the poets
tell: .
There’s nothin' I believe in now unless it's blimy

Melbourne ’Euald, wot goes barmy w’en the latest

On the kid that lived a fortnight ere its muvver

An’ w’en of luv an’ wedlock Den is itohin' to dis-

Gawd! ’e'll perish in ’is prime of wot the parson

T. J. LEY, N.S.W. Minister for Justice,
who proposes to revive some medmral
legislation.
I can picture dear old Dennis drinkin’ bitterness’s

W’en the golden sun is sinkin’, and ’is number’s goin’

W’en he feels hisself collapsin’ ’neath the burden of

Just because he sold ’is birfright to the journalistic

A BACK ANSWER.
“He said a most barefaced thing to me.”
“What did you do?”
“I turned my back on him.”
Concerning some Bathurst (N.S.W.)
identities :
Never in the history o? libel has there been a
more inexplicable row than that in which, on Satur-
day last, Michael Meaglier, of Bathurst, got a ver-
diet for £lOOO against the National Advocate, its
manager, editor and others. For many years the
plaintiff, who is a leading citizen of the place, as
his father was before him, has been a director and the
biggest individual shareholder of the Advocate, lie
and all the parties remained outwardly amiable,
though Percival (manager) and West (editor) went
steadily forward in the political sense, while Meagher
(possibly because he is an extremely rich man)
stayed on the moderate marie occupied by Laborites
of the pre-war vintage. However, beneath all this
apparent harmony, bitterness raged, and in due
course the libel appeared. It struck many as a
miracle of all-embracing comprehensiveness—until
the case began. The fact then became apparent that
the leader-writer had paltered with his job. Counsel
for the defence suggested to the astounded plaintiff
that he had been guilty of all sorts of crimes, rang,
ing from forgery down to trifles like stiffening horses
and running illicit stills. Had one-half of the alle-
gations been shown to be true it would have puzzled
many to know when this successful commercial man
did his other business. Incidentally, no doubt, the
charges had a deal to do with the size of the verdict.
Fun of the sort simply cannot be had on the cheap.
The position now is that someone will have to pay
Meagher his damages and the costs of a suit which,
with two li.C.’s and their appurtenances, has lasted
three weeks —say, .£lO,OOO. The defendants are not
wealthy men, and it would be an optimist who
offered £15,000 for the paper. Such is the finan-
cial problem with which some of the most luminous
intellects of Bathurst are faced.
The long, sad absence of our old friend,
“This house to let’’ will probably begin to be
remedied so far as Sydney is concerned,
inside the next three months. Previous
periods of poverty and unemployment were
accompanied by an epidemic of empty houses
and such a drop in rents that they some-
times received fatal injuries. About 1894
the homeless didn’t trouble the Domain much :
they camped in other people’s unlettable
houses. Now, there is an outbreak of empty
flats of the expensive sort, the property of
those who built and built, despite high prices
of materials, high wages, rates and taxes,
high strikes and the high interest offering
on Government loans, being actuated thereto
by the hope which springs eternal in the
bosom of Polly. Little houses will probably
be over-supplied also in the rush when the
owner can charge any rent he likes, and he
will finish by being glad to take a rent that
he hates. And in two or three years it may
he as easy to throw out the defaulting tenant
as in 1894, but it may have ceased to he
worth while. Many a man was welcome to
live rent-free then on the understanding that
he kept other men from stealing the house
Last year everything began to go down except
house-rent, which still rose, and that sug-
gested that the situation was purely artifi-
cial.

“Billy T.”: Falkland Montgomery (one
ot the Leicestershire family which has con-
tributed so many outstanding figures to the
Wctorian sheep industry) was motoring to
'valhalla with his wife and their small child,
and had pulled up by the wayside to attend
to the casual needs of
his ear. He had just
set things right when
a sundowning person
butted in with:
“Skews me, you may
not know it, but
you’ve got my wife
there.” “Got wliat?”
“My wife. I mislaid
her when I left here
10 years ago, but I’d
know her in a mil-
lion. You’ve got my
wife.” Boiling with
passion like a N.S.W.
Minister for Justice
in the presence of
atheism, the squatter
drove away. The
claimant clung on be-
hind, but was eventu-
ally shaken off. As
Montgomery was leav-
ing the hotel in Wal-
halla later in the
afternoon he was con-
fronted again by his
pushing acquaintance,
minus his swag and
with a considerable
portion of beer
aboard. Assisting and
comforting him was a
large, blousy lady
who might have been
a n ex-charwoman.
“Skews me, mister,”
hiccupped the inter-
loper, “I gottor ’polo-
gise for slight mish-
take. Thish isli the real Mrs. Biggs.
Foun’ her two hours ago. You mush
admit the ’markable close resemblance justi-
fies error.” Then Biggs fell into the hotel.
* * * *
“Solomon Malaprop” on a deep subject:—
Cable advices of last week show up the Turk as
the same Unspeakable Prohibitionist and Consumer
of Soft Drinks that he has ever been. When Abdul
Hamid, son of Abdul Medjid, came to the throne he
looked round and realised that of the dozen or twenty
Christian races that his ancestors had conquered the
bulk had left, taking their territories with them, and
the remainder showed a desire to pack up. He
decided to slay them and sow their land with his
own teetotallers. Russian interference wrecked the
scheme in Bulgaria, and the Sultan's resultant cold
feet made it only a partial success in Armenia. A
new rdgime pretty well completed the work in
Armenia, and is now busy wiping out the Greek popu-
lation of Asia Minor, which was Greek before either
Persians, Saracens, Crusaders or Turks came that way
—and Europe is too tired to interfere. A great deal
PASSERS-BY.
“When I engaged you I understood you to
be a lonely girl with no friends. Yet
men ring you up daily.”
“They’re dot friends; they’re only the ones
that take me out to dinner.”
of maudlin sentiment is talked about massacre which,
seeing that everybody must die some day and that
much of the world is over-populated, is by no means
a bad thing, if done courteously, firmly and with a
minimum of suffering. The chief, in fact almost the
only, objection to the business is that almost invari-
ably, or, anyhow, very often, the wrong persons are
killed. The tendency is for the bad folk to slay
the good ones, or at least the better ones; and if, on
rare occasions, really good folk take to wholesale
slaughter they seem to degenerate in the moral sense.
“The herring rots from the head downwards,” says the
old Turkish proverb, and on the same principle one
rarely finds a consistent assassin who is a churchgoer.
The cannibal eats the missionary to the world’s loss,
whereas the missionary ought to eat the cannibal to
the world’s gain. All things are muddled, mis-
managed and Wrong side up, and in consequence
massacre has never been the blessing that Providence
meant it to be.
* * * #
“Lex” sums up :
When T. J. Ley, Minister for Justice in the N. S.
Wales Government, recently proclaimed his deter-
mination “to prohibit, by an amendment to the
present law, any from declaring or suggesting that
a marriage celebrated according to the law of the
land is invalid, thus imputing dishonor to the parties
and illegitimacy to their children,” he committed
his colleagues to one of the biggest contracts in the
history of constitutional government. There are up-
wards of 700,000 Anglicans in N. S. Wales and
over 400,000 R.C.’s—roughly 75 per cent, of the
population. Practically all their ministers teach
what the Puller Government’s remarkable theologian
calls “a blasphemous libel.” To borrow his phrase:
“They audaciously quote Holy Writ saying, ‘Whom
God hath joined together let no man put asunder.’ ”
By refusing to marry divorced persons they declare
in the clearest possible manner that those who have
been united in less exigent quarters are invalidly
married —with all the implications that the sugges-
tion carries. True, they do not shout their convic-
tions to the newspapers in a manner designed to
wound those who think otherwise: they are mostly
what is known as “gentlemen.” But their beliefs
on this issue have been shown many times, and in
divers ways to be immutable. Meanwhile, Mr. Ley
has been guilty of gross disloyalty to his King and
Queen, who hold the view which he calls a blas-
phemous libel, and indicate it by refusing to allow
divorced men or women who have re-married to be
presented at Court (“But they aren’t married!”
cried Queen Victoria to Lord Melbourne when that
tolerart peer tried to have the convention modified in
the interests of one of his own relations.) And what
is even worse in a Minister for Justice, Mr Lev has
commuted a breach of the law. It has been
held by a high authority (cf. Dicey on the Con-
stitution) that “anyone who publishes matter relat-
ing to the Book of Common Prayer, intended
to excite contempt against the Church by Law estab-
lished” is liable to imprisonment. If it is admitted
that to accuse the Church of England of teaching
a blasphemous libel amounts to an expression of
contempt for that Church, its prayer-book and its
priests, then it is obviously Mr. Ley’s duty to have
himself arrested and brought to trial. It would be
a more inspiring gesture than a nv that he has exe-
cuted since he became a Minister of the Crown and
quite safe. In order to be convicted he would have
to strike 12 jurors a s mediaeval in their social outlook
as himself.
* * ♦ •
“Dolerite”: As another example of the
asininity of the Law, the chairman of the
Broken Hill Com-
pensation Scheme
Committee has
just given a re-
served decision to
the effect that any
woman who mar-
ries a man on the
Scheme funds is
entitled to com-
pensation afc a de-
pendant ; and on
the Mining * Com-
panies’ representa-
tive asking the
very natural ques-
tion : “Is there no-
thing, then, to pre-
vent a wo man
marrying a benefi-
ciary in the last
stages of pneu-
monia or tubercu-
losis and being
placed on the
funds?” the reply
was: “Nothing. It
is the policy of the
Law to encourage
marriage rather
than discourage
it.” What a law.
to put a premium
on such a swindle!
Wbnt n policy, nationally, to encourage such
unions!

“Ilambone”: “J.ILN.’s” par about Mul-
vany and his wharfie cobbers who drank a
keg of preserving spirit, containing an ape,
brings a nasty taste into my mouth. When
the battery had dug itself into a position in
the Flers mudheap in ’l6, the pack mules
bringing up our water stepped .off the cordu-
roy road into a shell-hole and disappeared.
Jim Vincent, our babbling brook, was rarely
at a loss, so we were not surprised w T hen we
found a steaming dixie waiting for us at
tea-oh. Questioned regarding the source of
supply, Jim indicated that he had souvenired
the water from a nearby shell-hole, certainly
the freshest-looking in the neighborhood.
Unfortunately, that night a 5.9 lobbed into
our reservoir and threw up the remnants of
a very defunct Fritz. It took 10 issues of
rum to drown the flavor of him.
THE TROUBLE-SEEKER.
“Sir, your daughter has promised to become
my wife.”
“Well, don’t come to me for sympathy. You
might have known something would
happen to you hanging around here five
nights a week.”
“E.D.”: A Melbourne clergyman: “It has
been asserted that the rich are for the Church
and the Church is for the rich.”
Who taught that heavenward pointing spire to rise?
“The man of Dross,’’ each lisping babe replies.

THE RUINED CURATE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
"The Right Rev. Churchill Julius, Bishop ot
Christchurch, said that the downfall of many suc-
cessful clergymen was pride. For his part he pre-
ferred the title Primate to that of Archbishop, the
latter savoring- of snobbery.”— M.L. news item.
The parish ladies all agreed,
Sipping their second cups of tea,
'I lie curate was a Dear indeed.
Their voices softened tenderly
As each told each time and again
How meek he was—how meek and mild.
At Sunday-school he raised no cane
In wrath on any naughty child,
But wept if one was rude to him.
At sick-beds (eyes all wet and dim)
He read with broken breath
The saddest texts on death—
S'o that some, though not really ill,
Insisted he should do it still,
So great his loving pity.
At croquet he stood quite alone.
The sharpest spinster ne’er had known
In rain or hail
Him e’er to fail
To be the first at each committee.
Strike, strike the- drum to drown a Christian's shame!
That high-held head were surely not the same!
No more he feeds the orphan child
With special curate-sweetened pap;
The sight of one would send him wild:
For tmns he does not care a rap.
And if his soft and pampered feet
Move from his sumptuous abode,
Policemen rush along the street
To clear the vulgar from the road.
At garden-parties, nose in air,
He walks on ladies’ gowns to tear
'The lace or silken borders ;
Or else in fury orders
The topliats to be ranged a-row
For his large gaitered feet to go
Over their sheen with Hunnish stride.
And yet perhaps in bed alone
He wakes, recalling with a moan,
How at one time
He knew not crime—
Being a curate free from Pride.

“Yarrum”: Re convictions on circumstan-
tial evidence. At Wollongong (N.S.W.)
some years ago a capital offence was com-
mitted by somebody, but, as the night was
dark and the venue lonely, the malefactor
couldn’t be identified. And then a hand-
kerchief bearing the name of a prominent
local citizen was found on the spot. lie
was accepted as guilty by 99 per cent, of
the residents, who agreed with hearty unan-
imity that “the cow was just that sorter
bloke” —as they always do in such circum-
stances —till it turned out that he was the
possessor of quite a decent sort of alibi.
He was on a jury, and had been locked up
with 11 colleagues on the night of the crime.

“Ne Temere”: —
I saw them on a Manly ferry steamer last Sun-
day afternoon. Delicious specimens they were of
sweet Australian maidenhood. The elder —I thought
of her fondly as Elaine —might have been 17. With
her sweetly tremulous mouth and rose-leaf pallor
she was all compact of appealing girlish grace. Her
companion—lmogen—was perhaps 10. Dark and
straight, the possessor of a profile of cold purity,
she suggested the proud and lovely little chatelaine
of some medieval castle. The magic of them was
still about me, like a gracious tropic perfume, when
the steamer plunged violently against the wharf,
after the manner of its kind, flinging the herded
passengers into one another’s arms. As I disen-
tangled myself from a Chinese vegetable gardener
and his wares I noticed that the wonder-girls were
near me. Presently they spoke. “Sy, Gert,” mur-
mured the elder, “if y’see any marskeline insects
flyin’ abart, blow' one of ’em along my way, will
yer?” “Betehcrlife, Kid,” was the reply. “That
is, after I’ve grabbed me own bit o’ twitchin’ eye-
brow.”

“Two Stripes” : Light Horsemen were dis-
consolate for a time in 1918, when their
proud record of not having had a single
officer captured seemed to have been broken.
Lieutenant F. L. Ridgway, of the 6th, was
THE ECONOMIST.
“My cook always cooks much more for
dinner than we can use!”
“Well, dear, if she didn’t she couldn’t econo-
mise by using left-over dishes.”
cut off with his troop by Jaeko during an
attack on March 28, and it was feared that
he and his men had chucked it. Another
troop later found Ridgway and his men
where they had fallen, disdaining quarter.
The Light Horse record remained unbroken
to the end.
“Gregor” grows philological.:-^
The student of argot will find it hard to be-
lieve that it was necessary for “Snowy” Baker in
his article on Australese for a San Francisco paper
(“Pollio,” B. 11/5/’22) to explain the meaning
of “boshter” and “bonza.” The probabilities are
that these unlovely adjectives came to the Common-
wealth direct from ’Frisco, where, up to ten or
DANGEROUS WORK.
“Have you proposed to Maudio yet?”
“No. She said I’d have to ash her mother first.”
"Why don’t you?”
“Because the old devil might accept me.”
a dozen .years ago, “bonza” and some of its deriva-
tives were in frequent use. “Bonza” is a contrac-
tion of the Spanish-American “bonanza,” employed
as a mining term and later applied to anything of
great worth or value. From Mexico and the coun-
tries further south it travelled up to California,
and the chances are that gold-seekers first brought
it to Australia. There was a time when it was
used in ’Frisco to much the same extent as here —
except by people who prided themselves on the
purity of their diction. Later it fell into disuse,
just as so many pre-war terms have gone out of
fashion in Australia since returned Diggers began
to enrich the vernacular with something more racy
and pungent.
* * * *
“Derwent”: Dr. Fred Watson, the Fed-
eral Government Historian, brings out some
vividly interesting stuff in his latest volume
—which is on Van Diemen’s Land. A cen-
tury ago the social life of the Speck seems
to have resembled that of one of those
humble neighborhoods where the idle poor
are continually “pulling” one another before
the nearest beak for abusive language:
omitting to put duty stamps on re-
ceipts, stealing the milk, and so forth
and so on. At one time few of the
governing officials were on speaking
terms with the others, everyone having
at one time or another reported some-
body else to Governor Macquarie for
various delinquencies, from sheep-steal-
ing downwards. In 1814 the Deputy-
Surveyor at Port Dalrymple joined the
bushrangers in order to evade his credi-
tors. It was a form of plagiarism—the
Deputy-Commissary had taken the same
extreme step two years earlier. Dr. Watson
notes that both escaped punishment. The
Surveyor was captured, but bolted again,
and the Commissary came in of his own
accord when the bushrangers were amnestied
in May, 1814.
“Exul”: Even the defenders of Colin Ross
made little bones about admitting that his
reputation was a very evil one. What I want
to know is why, in these days of great
advancement in psychopathic knowledge and
methods of diagnosing and classifying mental
ters of criminals when they first come under
the notice of the police. If that were done
such persons as Ross could be segregated for
life, both for the protection of themselves
and the community. Sadism and similar
mental disorders are as much diseases as
leprosy. Yet, while lepers are isolated, the
equally helpless sadist is allowed to go on
until he behaves according to his kind, and
is called on to pay the legal penalty therefor.
As a deterrent the nunishment is absolutely
useless. You can’t stop such a man from
developing a moral (any more than a physi-
cal) abscess by threatening him. It is good
to note that an Act has been recently passed
in Tasmania providing for the investigation
of feeblemindedness and allied conditions in
schoox children. It may be the first step
towards a reform of the criminal law in its
barbarous attitude towards the mentally
defective.
* * * *
“Copabella”: Defendant in a Geelong
(Vic.) drunk and disorderly case was offered
his discharge if he would take the pledge.
He agreed. Justices there have a pet for-
mula which debars the signatory not only
from taking intoxicating liquor but from
entering premises where it is sold or con-
sumed. The penitent nearly collapsed when
the document was read to him. “Gawd, your
W’ships,” he said, “I can’t sign that last bit.
Where’d Ibe able to get me business?” He
was a bottle-oh. Their W’ships appreciated
his position and added a saving clause —
“unless in pursuit of my calling.” Where-
upon the conscientious alcoholist signed. The
bottle-gatherer’s position resembled that of
a man who was recently discharged from
Pentridge on the understanding that he would
call on a certain probation officer once a
month, and also fail to haunt places “where
spirituous liquors are sold.” He complained
bitterly about the size of his contract on
discovering that the man to whom he had
to report is in charge of a flourishing pub.
The Crown Law authorities apparently
knew this, but assumed that the offender
could meet his obligations by hailing Bung
through a hole in the back fence or drawing
'.attention to his presence in the roadway
opposite the hostelry.
Re par. (B. 11/5/’22) about
the technicalities which have to be complied
with when Australians seek to land in the
country of the wooden nutmeg and the shoe-
peg oats. There is less red tape now than
when I reached New York from Liverpool in
1599. There was a rule then that every-
one hitting the soil of the U.S.A. must
possess £G. That nearly kept me out. But
though I could not show £6 in cash I had
a draft on a New York bank for £5O. Even
then I was not suffered to disembark until
an official from the bank had come down
to the Cunard wharf and cashed the draft!
That was before the horrors of Ellis Island
had begun.
* * * *
“Copabella”: When a soldiers’ memorial
obelisk at Geelong (Vic.) had been wrought
and erected it was noticed that the stone-
masons had so placed their firm-name on
the base that the inscription read :—“Lest
We Forget—Chissle and Mallett, Sculp.”
A brass plate is now to be affixed, bearing
a fetv supererogatory details, but hiding the
firm-name. This makes the second obliterat-
ing brass in the Pivot. When the classic
City Hall, begun in 1855, was completed
in 1915 a base stone, fair in the front, was
boldly inscribed with the fact. Somebody
seeing it, murmured. “Sleepy Hollow—6o
years!” So the libellous truth was hastily
covered with a large brass giving the names
of the city fathers.
* * * #
“Wilfrido”: Under the Licensing Act
(M.L.) it is an offence to be on licensed
premises after hours without a legitimate
reason. During the last few weeks I have
heard the following excuses set up:
(a) that the defendant was a friend
of the licensee, (b) that he was courting
the barmaid, (c) that he wanted to use the
telephone, (d) that he owed the clerk
money, (e) that he was teaching the licen-
see’s daughter how to jazz. All were con-
victed and fined 405.; on the other hand
one man who said brazenly that he went in
because he had “a norrible thirst” got off
with 20s. The point is that no reason is
accepted as legitimate. All are presumed to
be after booze on much the same sound line
of reasoning as impels the Bench, in another
turisdiction, to find against the lodger who
flas been detected in respondent’s bedroom.
But the liar is charged double for his fun,
which stimulates veracity and helps the
revenue even if it. doesn’t do much for
sobriety.
* * * *
“T. 0.1.”: A bit of “Old” Sydney under
sentence of demolition is Queen’s-court, in
Dalley-street. Its 12 tiny cottages date
back to 1834. In Sydney Herald, Feb.
16, 1835, Samuel Lyons advertised that he
was instructed to sell by auction “Twelve
new brick dwelling-houses, counting-houses
and spacious vaults situate on the north
side of Queen’s-street, and comprising the
whole of Queen’s-place and the adjoining
quay.” Originally the buildings were occu-
pied by merchants, but in the ’forties they
were residential. One of them was once
occupied by Henry Parkes, who in a letter
to liis friends in England, dated May 1,
1840, says that he is employed as a brass-
finisher in Bussell’s foundry, Queen’s-place,
at ss. per day.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
To keep unlicensed dogs; to hose
My neighbor standing in his garden;
To hold the traffic while I eat
My dinner sitting in the street
Is wrong, as each good burgher knows —
Wrong beyond hope of any pardon.
To fumble long and find no ticket
While tram-inspectors glare; to lie
On park or beach in slumber sunk,
An unashamed and hopeless drunk;
To take your throat and try to snick it
With safety-razors till you die
Arc clearly harmful to the nation,
And should be viewed with detestation.
But w'hat I cannot understand
(And never shall, I am afraid)
Is why fat men may unmolested
Parade the streets, nor be arrested —•
Digusting proofs on every hand
Of human appetites betrayed.
Their waistcoats strain! 1 hide my eyes!
Is this the human form divine?
Bloated with food and reckless living
They swell and stretch past all forgiving—
Disgraceful curve, prodigious rise,
Their sins projected for a sign....
Why lock the drunkard in a cell,
And over-eaters leave for Hell ?

“W. Blister” : On Tilcha station (S.A.)
there is a rather well-educated English girl married
to an aboriginal. She lives in the camp, sharing the
food of the blacks, has two half-caste children, and
appears to be quite happy. I have known several
cases of a white man taking a lubra in marriage,
also one or two instances of a half-caste marrying a
white woman; but I have never collided with a
similar case to that at Tilcha. Anyone know of
another ?
* * * *
“Ragar”: The custom of planting the liv-
ing wife with the dead husband —when that husband
happens to be a chief—is still indulged in by some
THE COUNTER-ATTRACTION.
WAYFARER: “Don't worry, boss. They'll come back when that grass’opper bloke 'ops
’ome!”
New Guinea tribes off the beaten track of mission-
aries and Government officials. The widow doesn’t
seem to have any say in the matter, but takes her
place beside her defunct hubby in the hole dug for
them in the middle of the village, which is then
filled in and well trampled down. After the last
of the earth has been stamped in a fire is lighted
over the spot and kept burning for three days.
Mourning ceases with the actual burial, and after the
fire goes out nothing further is done in the matter.
The custom of burying alive is also practised when a
woman dies in child-birth, the child being buried
alive with its dead mother unless someone comes
forward and adopts it, as is not infrequently done.
The burying in this case is done merely with the
idea of getting rid of the unwanted infant, suffocation
being considered as good a method of killing it as
any other way.

“Essemble”; Teddy, old-man Whiting’s
handy man, used always to slip down and open the
gate when he heard the boss’s buggy coining, Whit-
ing- being a bit old for clambering up and down
needlessly. Then one summer night, when he was
in bed, he heard the buggy coming up the track,
and without waiting to put on any clothes ran
down in his shirt. Mrs. Whiting happened to be
with the boss, and was considerably shocked. “You
should have put your pants on, Teddy,” said the old
man sternly. “Och, it’s all right, sorr,” said Teddy
cheerfully, “it’s not cowld.”
* * * *
“Panmore”: This sounds over the odds,
but it’s dinkum. A pal and I were having a spell
on the bank of the Bowman Creek (near Gloucester,
N.S.W.) when we heard sounds of a struggle under-
ground, and shortly after a splash. Looking over
the bank we saw an outsize in eels swimming about
with a full-grown rabbit gripped by the throat.
There was a burrow in the bank about 18in. above
water-level; and the loose sand at the entrance bore
unmistakable traces of the eel, which had un-
doubtedly gone into the burrow after bunny. It
was 3 o’clock on a hot afternoon, but we were
both cold sober.
* * * *
“D.F.”: Some men are too methodical in
their habits, and so are some horses. Twelve
months ago Daniel Paddinson’s horse fell with him
near Blanchview (Q.), and Daniel fractured his left
thigh. The other day the same horse fell again at
the same spot, and Daniel fractured the same thigh.
* # * *
“FY7”: Years ago, when Waterton, in
hia “Amazon,” wrote of gouging the eyes of an
attacking cayman he was dubbed a liar. Just
recently Harry Summerfield, of Alligator Creek, near
Darwin (N.T.), tried the dodge on a crocodile which
had grabbed him by the leg at the water’s edge.
Summerfield had to gouge out both optics before
the scaly horror let go, and was lucky enough to
finish in Darwin Hospital instead of somewhere in
the innards of the croc. The Darwin account of the
affair says the happening explodes the theory that
“fresh water alligators will not attack man.” Like
many other Australians the Darwinite confuses the
estuarine crocodile (which is found as often in fresh
water as salt and is a man- and cattle-eater when
he gets a chance) with the gavial, which occurs in
the great fresh-water lagoons and river pools of the
North, and is known there as the fresh-water alliga-
tor. This gentleman has close cousins in India and
China, and centuries of observation have given him
the reputation of a fish-eater, pure and simple. He
is much lighter built and more agile than his croco-
dile relative, and has a very long and narrow snout,
which marks him out at once from the true alliga-
tors and crocodiles.

“Wanda”: Tell “Nadehan” (B. 20/4/’22)
that my hen’s nest was 40ft. up in a pine (Finns
insignia) —an old nest of the ring-tailed opossum,
The old lady used to climb up via the branches
and come down aeroplane fashion. With the excep-
tion of one, all the chicks reached the earth by
tumbling. The last one, No. 10, was rescued with
a prawn-net affixed to a pole, into which the nest,
chick and all, was poked. Prior to the final act No. 10
had become proficient in walking the branches, ap-
pearing from time to time several feet from the nest
and retreating to his pine-needle home whenever he
was approached. Not one of the fledglings was
injured by its sudden descent, but the thick foliage
of the tree broke the fall.
* * * *
“F.D.D.”: When “Allyn” (B. 13/4/’22)
was describing the “huge mud springs” in the Mt.
Hutton (Q.) district, and the “dust which is used as
a substitute for baking-powder,” he might have
included a few remarks about the tigeroos in the
same locality; and a word or two about the native
compelicans that live in the mud springs would
have been more than interesting.
* * * *
“Mullarula”: Binglii’s relationships are
not quite such a puzzle as they appear on the sur-
face. Certainly there are a number of brothers and
sisters who may be no relations at all, while others
may be real members of the same family. This
is due to the fact that each tribe is divided into
four classes, and the members of one may only marry
members of one out of the other three, while the off-
spring of such marriages will belong to a different
class to either of the parents. This makes it im-
possible for relatives to marry, as there are no young
relatives in the eligible class. The members of the
forbidden classes are all regarded in a tribal sense
as relatives, and in a community of limited numbers
the majority will be found to be related. All
members of one class are regarded as brothers; but
the majority in small tribes will really be cousins.
The only weak point in the law is that it is
possible for a young buck to marry his great-aunt—
but his inclinations would hardly lie in that direc-
tion.
A DOMESTIC TROUBLE.
“Say, Jackie, I thought you were coming out last wWeek work for me.”
“Yer see, boss, yer don't know my pheller missus. She bin too plurry lazy carry swag.”
“Linker” recalls some hustlers: —
“Arbeep” (B. 30/3/’22) loftily seeks to confound
with a mass of figures “Toby C.’s” statement of a
platelaying record of 62 chains in 61 hours by eight
men. ‘"Arbeep’s” knowledge must have been gleaned
from a correspondence course. “Toby C.’s’’ plate-
laying obviously referred to the “linking-in,” that
is, laying the rails and sleepers in position on the
formation. With heavy material eight men are
required, but with lighter rails—4slb. to the yard
and under —six men and sometimes four do the job,
the number depending on the length of the rails.
The linking-in is the sole factor governing the speed
at which platelaying is accomplished. Only a limited
number of men can be put at it, while the rest of
the gang doing the fishing-up, back-bolting the plates,
spiking the road, etc., can be increased or lessened
according to the speed of the linking-in. The
adzing and boring of "sleepers, of which “Arbeep”
makes a point, is done by a machine back in the
material depot before the sleepers are sent to the
head of the road. Anyhow, “Toby C.’s” record is a
mere woollynose effort, as the linkers would say. On
the construction of the Magnet-Sandstone (W.A.)
railway (3ft. 6in. gauge), about 1909, six men linked-
in a mile a day for each of 49 consecutive working
days, using 451 b. rails 30ft. long, and on the majo-
rity of days they were finished under seven hours.
The total plate-laying gang consisted of 35 men,
and each day the whole of the line was completed
ready for the train, except the ballasting, which on
construction is often left for months after the plate-
laying. The following records, all Westralian, refer
to 3ft. 6in. gauge line, and 451 b. rails, 30ft. long:
On the Mullewa-Wongan Hills line in 1914
40 chains of line were linked-in by six
men in 2hr. 35min. It was a special effort, arising
out of an argument, and will take some beating. I
was timekeeper, and one fully-loaded trolley ran
over the head of the road, which delayed them
9min. On the same line the same six men linked-
in 105 chains in lOmin. over the Bhr. On the
Northam-Goomalling line, Ted Mudge, a well-known
foreman, with a gang of 11 men, laid and com-
pleted 40 chains of line, including all the back
work, day after day, for over three months. It
took a good eight hours, but as a record I think it
will stand for all time.
* * * *
“Gazeka” Re “C. Coral” (B. 4/5/’22)
and tailed men. This is from Monekton’s “Last Days
in New Guinea” (page 56) :
At the time I should have reported more of my
observation's. .. .only for fear of the infernal liars
who seized upon a small fact, magnified it into an
absurdity, and then fathered the yarn on me! For
instance, the long queues worn by the Doriri were
turned into “tailed men.”
The “tailed men” of New Guinea are evidently the
creation of a fertile liar; but it is marvellous how
a real De Rougemont yarn is believed.
* * *
“The Rumpus” : One day, as I was bring-
ing wool down the Ashburton River (W.A.), a willy-
willy got my lid and took it for a joy ride. I knew
it was no good looking for it afterwards, so I made
a head-covering out of some packing, and carried
on. Two months later I was chasing a job on the
Gascoyne River, when I bumped into a Binghi wear-
ing my lost hat. He explained that he found it
near his river. He was a Gascoyne native, and not
likely to be fooling about with any other water-
course. The distance between the two rivers would
be about 150 miles.
• “Bruce Lonie”: “I don’t like ®to say
nothing about the dead,” said Whelan to me, “but
Casey did me fer a couple of ducks. I laid stricknin’
bait 3 fer rabbits, and it copped ’em orright; but
Blossom goes and chews a skin an’ I finds ’er stiff.
A week after that a big goanner was at Blossom,
and after ’e’s fed on ’er fer eight days that damn
stuff gets ’im too. I found ’im beside ’er, so I
takes the fat an’ renders it fer oil. A coupla days
after I pulls me gun through with ther new oil, an’
goes down ther creek after ducks. A mob gets up
at ther bend an’ I looses one barrel inter them; but
dammit if someone across ther creek don’t blaze
at ther same time. It was Casey, an’ two fool
ducks fell at ’is feet. I shot ’em orlright, but ’e
said ’e did, and ’e settled the argument by walkin’
off with ’em. That was er Monday. On Wednesday
I meets ole Winch on me way ter town. ’E
says, bustin’ with it, ‘Did ye hear ther news? —
Casey’s fam’ly is all dead; the doctor says they’ve
bin poisoned be stricknin’.’ So they was my ducks.’’

“Gagi” : Re “Yond’s” three teethless brothers
(B. 27/4/’22). In Sydney some years ago a man,
who said his mouth felt like a circular-saw accident,
had it examined, and it w'as found that inside the
original row of teeth another set was coming. What
is more, they eventually came. The original row was
gradually pushed out and the new one took its
place. I have since known several cases of third
sets of teeth developing like this —three people over
THE DOWNTRODDEN POOR.

THE FAR-OFF.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I am riding through the ranges
In the morning’s misty light,
And around me is blue sunshine,
Flooding hollow land and height;
And above the heights one white cloud
Through the azure slowly floats,
While the bell-birds in the valleys
Charm the air with silver notes.
There is beauty for the seeing
All around about me spread—
Arching fern-fronds, green and dewy,
Sapling-tops of shining red,
Misty glades and groves and hollorvs,
And beyond them mountain walls
Vast and wonderful, or softly
Veiled by lacey waterfalls.
There is music for the hearing
All around about me thrown —
Now the song of velvet waters
Sung to root and mossy stone;
Now the melodies of magpies,
Sweet beyond all melodies;
Now the leaf-harp of the forest
Touched to music by the breeze.
I am riding through the ranges,
Through their splendors, bright and brave,
But it’s not of them I’m thinking
Though at times their charms enslave;
Though around me beauty broadens—
Beauty blessed by melody;
Oh, it isn’t birds I'm hearing,
And it isn’t flowers I see.
Heard by me as through the ranges
In the morning light I roam,
Is a fiddle singing, sighing,
In a quaint suburban home;
Seen by me there comes the vision
Of a garden growing there,
And a little grey-haired woman
Musing on a wicker chair.

‘Aed Kelly”: Another instance of a
horse coming to his master in time of trouble (B.
27/4/’22). We were breaking in some youngsters
at Brogo (N.S.W.), and among them was a fine
roan colt I had singled out for my own. He was a
bad one to handle, but the night following his first
“riding ’ he came up to the house and we couldn't
drive him away. His behavior was more like that
of a pet pony than a quarter-broken colt. We found
him dead in the morning. Snakebite.
“Crooked Sam”: “Aliya's” bibulous
billy-goat (B. 27/4/’22) reminds me that in Grafton
(N.S.W.) there is, or was two years ago, a pony
who accompanies his owner into the hotels, and can
drink a pint with the best. Of course the glass has
to be held for him, but he doesn’t spill Iris liquor,
like some clumsy people I know.
* * * *
“Gee”: If “J.E.G.’s” mare (B. 2/2/’22)
has mange, a cure I have never seen beaten is
separator oil mixed with a small quantity of drip-
ping. This, if rubbed well on the mangy part, will
prevent the itch and consequently the rubbing;
besides, it will cause the hair to grow.
* * * *
“Malice Murray”: Has “Spud” (B.
20/4/’22) discovered a new kind of March-fly, or
is he thinking of the bot-fly? I have never noticed
a “March” attack a horse under the jaw; but this
is the bot’s favorite spot. Still, there’s no more
trouble when a small piece of red rag is tied to the
throat-strap of the winkers.
“W. Blister” : This notice appears over the
lmt door of an Outback rabbit-proof fence boundary-

differentiation of poisonous from lion-poisonous
snakes by the fact that the former have three .big
scales between their eyes and the latter seven to
eleven smaller ones. lirefft noticed that the venom-
ous wrigglers had never more than six scales border-
ing their top lips on each side, while their less
formidable brethren always had more than six.

“FY7”: Tell “Marora Mick” (B.
20/4/ 22) that his lady who owned and employed a
stallion as a means of livelihood was not alone, even
A ONE-CURATE-POWER VEHICLE.

in Bananaland. A well-known woman-farmer who used
to occupy the homestead of what was once Chiverton
station on the Downs had several horses and bulls at
stud, and personally supervised all details. The
most expert stud lad could show the old lady nothing
when it came to handling the most difficult cases.
“H.Y.E.”: “Otway’s” parrot (B. 20/4/’22)
is probably the rare Murray smoker, or yellow
parrot ( Platycercus flaveolus) , as his description
accords with this bird, except that there is some
pale sky-blue on the wings. His specimen may not
have been in full plumage. The forehead of this
species is crimson. I have twice seen the yellow

parrot—single birds only—fying and feeding with
flocks of rosellas on the Monaro (N.S.W.) plains,
where it is somewhat out of its latitude. its
unusual beauty moved sober Gould to remark “An
exceedingly lovely bird, a harmony in blue and
canary-yellow.”
G.C. ’: A little while ago someone was
talking about ancient breakers. Well, o ld Tom
Dodd, 72 in his socks, is still breaking-in young-
sters at Holbrook (N.S.W.), and sitting bucks,
too, that would have most of us taking a second
gnp at the air. He never had a nerve in his body
and once in the old days in the Riverina drove
Uliy Cox in a buggy and pair licketty-split over a
brush fence. They didn’t break a strap.
“Broome”: “Ando” (B. 16/3/’22) re-
minds me of the nor’-West Binghis’ way of settling
differences about borrowed wives. As a rule thev
arc stickers for Marquis of Queensbury rules and
make a date to square matters. With attendants
they meet on a cleared patch, each armed with a
spear without barb. Stand-
ing about sft. apart with
left leg advanced, one
takes first blood by driv-
ing his spear clean
through the back of the
well-braced thigh of the
other. Then the latter
without moving his
ground, does likewise.
Thus each in his turn
braces back or bends for-
ward to deliver the stroke,
and the test of endur-
ance goes on until one
peeks. It is not neces-
sary for him to drop his
spear and extend his
arms with his palms open
to show he has had
enough and relinquishes
his right to the piece de
resistance. I have doc-
tored a number of cases,
and six punctures were
the most I found on the
one Binghi. That chap hobbled round on his job all
the time he was healing. But he won the scrap and
still has the woman.
“P.T.W.”: “F.C.L.’s” alligator (B.
27/4/’22) is not a record. I saw one caught in
the Fitzroy River, above Rockhampton (Q.), in the
early ’seventies, and exhibited in the old Theatre
Royal, East-street, that measured 24ft. 9in. in length
and 9ft. lOin. in girth.
* * * *
“Invalid”: “Wild Oat’s” 10 horses (B.
27/4/22) will be developing greasy heels if he
cannot do more than 11 acres in a day with a 13-
dise cultivator. Adrian Young, of Yalca (Vic.),
using only six horses, has several times done 15,’
and he doesn’t think it any record, either.
•'Keel”: I saw a tree like that described
by “Pat Bushie” (B. 20/4/’22), growing in a garden
in Denham-street, Rockhampton (Q.), and on inquiry
was told it was a “Rose of Sharon.” It grows
readily from cuttings.
“H2S.”: The mange afflicting the horses
of “Crooked Sam” (B.
13/4/’22) and “J.E.G.” (B.
2/2/’22) is caused by the
parasite Psoroptes communis,
var. equi. It attacks shel-
tered positions, as the mane
and tail, the intermaxillary
space, the breast, sheath and
inner side of the arm and
thigh. It does not extend
below the knees and hocks,
but may occasionally occur
on the withers and back. It
is transmitted from horse to
horse, and produces intense
pruritus (itching). The ani-
mal rubbing the parts may
produce serious sores. The
parasite lives on the surface,
and is not difficult to dis-
cover. Try this: Flowers of
sulphur, ljlb. ; unslaked lime,
ljlb. ; water, 74gal. Moke
the unslaked lime into thick
paste, sift in the sulphur and
stir well. Put this mixture
into a tub with 2lgal. of
water and boil for an hour.
When the ohocolate-lookirg
mass settles the clear fluid is
drawn off, and enough water
to make 7Jgal. is added. Use
warm (a shade warmer than
blood-beat). Rub into the
parts affected with a stiffish
brush that has a handle, and
protect the hands with gloves
or some other covering. Apply
every second day for three
dressings. N.i-Do the
cooking-part of the business
out of doors—and to wind-
ward.
“Moe”: In describing the oil “distilled”
from old newspapers as an impure form of creosote,
to which fact is due its efficacy in stopping tooth-
ache, “Prof.” (B. 4/5/’22) is slightly at sea in his
chemistry. The principal constituent of paper,
especially newsprint, is cellulose, whereas creosote
is an aromatic or “ring” compound—quite a differ-
ent thing, and there is no interchangeability between
the two bodies. Creosote does exist in wood, but
the sulphite process of paper-making removes it, so
that it is not present in the paper; indeed, creosote
is actually a by-product of some processes for the
manufacture of wood-pulp and paper. In all pro-
bability “newspaper oil” is a very crude form of
pyroligneous acid, that is, a mixture of methyl alco-
hol, acetone, acetic acid and other bodies.
“Bill the Mug”: Re “Tin-pot Bill’s” soli-
tary miner (B. 27/4/’22). To-day there is an
Australian, a native of Maitland (N.S.W.), working
a claim not far from Warwick (Q.). He sank a
perpendicular shaft 126 ft. through solid diorite,
ascending and descending by means
of a Jacob’s ladder. He would lower
his oil-drum, then clamber down, fill
it wit rock and come up again and
wind the drum to the surface. After
drilling a couple of holes he would
charge them, light the fuse and
scamper up the ladder, just in time
to roll out on top when the bang
came. He expected to cut the re»f
at 150 ft., and as he had attained
the age of 65 he applied for the
old age pension. He got it, but was
ordered not to go down that shaft
again on the Jacob’s ladder. This
injunction lie obeyed, but with
real Australian grit he went back on the line, and
is to-day following the reef down on the underlay—
and is getting a very nice prospect.
* * * *
“Barcoo”: Give some of the Abo. team-
sters a taste of this: A Blackall (C.Q.) wheelwright
recently completed the largest wool-waggon built to
date. The contraption weighs in itself 4J tons,
and when “pulled into gear” will carry 25 tons,
approximately 150 bales of greasy wool. The rear
wheels are 7ft. 2in. high, with tyres 7in. wide and
liin. thick, and the front wheels are 6ft. 6in. high
with similar tyres. The back axle is 4in. in diam-
eter, while the front one goes 3-1 in. The floor space
is 22ft. by Bft. Oin. The flooring is of blue gum
from Kingaroy, down near the coast; the spokes and
naves are of grey ironbark, one of Queensland’s most
notable hardwoods, and the body is made of spotted
gum, probably the most elastic and weather-resisting
timber in the Commonwealth.
* * * *
“Parnell”: “8.E.8.” (B. 4/5/’22), in his
enthusiasm for Tom Hanson’s feat in spaying 233
cows in 11 hours, has neglected to check the figures
or wait till the man who told him sobered up.
Allowing the lightning cow-surgeon one hour for
those two full meals, and the operation on a bull,
he would have to put the cows through at slightly
over 23 per hour. This is just possible for perhaps
half an hour, or an hour, but not for 10 hours.
What about jambs in the crush and cows knocking
themselves about in the bail and becoming too hot
to be operated on ? A few years ago I heard “Dinny”
Ronan, one-time manager of Victoria River (and
himself a champion with the long' spay-blade) sav
that 2i minutes was nearly a record for the whole
operation from closing the bail to letting out. While
in the western State I drifted on to a nor’-west sta-
tion, and was made assistant to a Grand Master of
the Knives and Needles. I timed him and and found
him turning them out a shade under 2 1 minutes
per head. That would go on for perhaps half an
hour, then down would come a raging, mad, over-
heated cow that would hold up the business for
perhaps 10 minutes. Or another would do gymnas-
tics in the bail and have to be let out. Of course,
Tom Hanson’s cows might have been used to being
spayed.
* * * •
"M. Heale”: Re “Nadehan’s” mystifica-
tion (B. 20/4/’22) as to how a hen got her chicks
to the ground from a nest 6ft. up. We had a hen
that brought out a brood on a packing-case about
sft. high, and my brother, sister and myself all saw
her bring a chick down by fluttering to the ground
with the youngster’s leg in her beak. She had
already brought three downstairs when we saw her,
and we finished the job for her.
* * * *
“Q.E.D.”: Re “Billy Caim’s” lament con.
cerning boiler trouble (B. 6/4/’22). Lacking a com-
plete analysis of his feed water, it is impossible
to recommend a cure with certainty. Assuming
there is magnesium in the water and also salt, it
is probable that the magnesium is in the form of
magnesium chloride. There is no feasible method
in the circumstances indicated of removing either
the salt or the magnesium chloride, as both are
very soluble. As the feed water is from a well, it
is possible the water is acid (tannic acid or acetic
acid) from the presence of decaying leaves or bark
in the well, or a peaty stratum in the ground. Both
the above acids are very destructive to iron at high
temperatures, the effects (black scale and pitting)
being the same as in the case of magnesium salts.
The engine is presumably non-condensing, so the
presence of organic oil in the feed from cylinder
lubrication may be ruled out. In a non-condensing
engine of the usual type (semi-portable), however,
the lubrication of the feed pump might be looked
to, and only a good grade of straight mineral oil
used. My recommendations are:—
(1) Test the feed water for acidity with litmus
paper (any chemist will supply neutral blue litmus
paper for a few pence), and if the water turns the
blue litmus red it is sufficiently acid to cause trouble.
This can be easily corrected by the agitation of
the water with lime in a tank, taking care to
allow settlement before using, so that no lime is
pumped into the boiler, as this will form scale on
the tubes causing overheating and loss of efficiency.
The well should also be cleared of any vegetable
matter, chips, bark, sawdust, leaves, etc., and steps
taken to prevent any percolation of water through
such rubbish on the surface finding its way into
the well.
(2) If the water is not acid then magnesium salts
are probably the trouble. The remedy here is to
keep the boiler water from becoming too dense by

frequent blowing off. If a practice is made of
blowing about 2in. or 3in. of water out of the
boiler at crib, and knock off when steam is not
being used and the boiler then pumped up again it
will help materially.
(3) The best corrective of all corrosion troubles
from whatever cause, and one that “Billy Cann”
should put into operation at once, irrespective of
what else he does, is the use of zinc blocks inside
the boiler. These are sold for the purpose by most
engineers’ stores, and are generally about Bin.
square and lin. thick. Two should be used, wired
to the tubes at opposite “corners” of the boiler, with
half-a-dozen turns of fencing wire, so as to be quite
immersed. These act in the same way as galvan-
ising, the zinc corroding instead of the iron. I in-
variably use these in tube boilers, even with water
above suspicion. Their cost is negligible, and their
life varies as the tendency of the feed water to
corrode is more or less.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Blue April in her cloak of green
Went down the mountain-side;
And with a tender mother-mien
The autumn bareness spied.
Redheads the leafy silence split;
And as she marked their lay
The first white wattle flare she lit
To herald yellow May.

"BUBBLER"Demonstration by DANES at SYDNEY"ROYAL SHOW
The “Bubbler” is a small, patent wool-
scouring plant, invented by a West
Australian wool-elasser, for home
scouring low grade, dingy, dusty wool,
bellies, pieces, stained pieces, locks or
dead wool. You can scour in the quiet
time after shearing, at a cost of about
lfd. per lb. (on the clean wool).
The saving effected will more than
justify the cost of the plant in one
season. The outfit is worked in con-
junction with any ordinary windmill
water supply. Expert labor is not
necessary—any novice can work the
plant. Follow the simple directions
and mistakes are impossible.
You will be surprised at the results.
No matter how hard the water is, you
can take at least 95 per cent, of the
dirt out of the wool, and make market-
able what otherwise would be waste
product.
The smaller size “Bubbler” has a
capacity of 5 bales a day, and the
larger size a capacity of a bale an
hour. These plants are alreadv in-
stalled and giving complete satisfac-
tion on some of the largest holdings in
Western Australia, including Austin
Downs, Mulga Downs, Boolardy, Yar-
rabubba, Yowergabbie. Burbina, Wad-
gee, Glenburg, Rio Tinto, Yalgoo and
other stations.

'IT STANDS ADO" 55 ®'
and “L’Automne.” The biography shows that
Verlaine was a predestined derelict.
His presentiments, his longings for the
companionship of a strong comrade to save
him from his own weak self were always
part of him :
Je fais souvent ce reve Strange et pSnetrant,
D’une femme inconnue etc.
Car elle me comprend, et mon coour transparent
Pour elle seule, hSlas! cesse d’etre un problSme.
He hadn’t even the strength of vice, the bold,
defiant callousness of his bizarre friend
Arthur Rimbaud. He regretted ever. He
seemed to be always melting into tears:
II pleure dans mon cceur,
Comme il pleut sur la ville.
Or
Je me souviens
De jours anciens,
Et je pleure.
And—
Ecoutez la chanson bien douce
Qui ne pleure que pour voua plaire.
And there are countless other examples.
His imprisonment at Mons, where he read
the whole of Shakspeare’s works in Eng-
lish, and his second imprisonment at Vouziers
(this time for alleged assault on his fond old
mother) seem sadly discordant with those
poems which float in the air as softly wail-
ing as Dante’s vision of Paolo and Fran-
cesca.
Oscar Wilde wrote once that Verlaine’s life
was the most beautiful in history. In what
sense he found it so is a riddle. Certainly not
i.n the Greek sense, for I have yet to learn that
habitual drunkenness was included in the
Cult of the Beautiful. It is useless sur-
mising why the gods are jealous of man’s
greatest gifts: the pathologists could no
doubt explain it. But the sensitive soul is
very often harnessed to exceeding common
clay. Perhaps it is this uneven union which
actually forces out those haunting cadences.
It was Frank Harris, in his study of Her-
bert Spencer, who said that “the torture
chamber of life (modern life was his
term, but the qualification was unscien-
tific, since the inner life is always
the same and only the surface moves)
Shakspeare and Dostoievsky alone of men
so far have dared to enter or been able to
describe.” It is unique in human history
that a. “Tempest” follows a “King Lear.”
We don’t pretend to ask this of less-
balanced souls. We are content to accept
the human frailty with the gift divine. So
whether Verlaine, catalogued with scholastic
precision as Parnassian, decadent or symbol-
ist, excitSb compassion or the reverse is Si
matter of indifference now. In speaking of
his legacy to mankind (“Let us dream....
It is the hour”) we can all exclaim with his
mistress, Eug&nie Krantz, when at his grave-
side she beheld all France’s noblest sons
represented: “Paul! Paul, ils sont tous la.”
LUTE DRUMMOND.
American Fiction
With average Australian readers Ameri-
can fiction is far more popular than English
fiction, and English writers of the lighter
sort who are in any sense Americanised
(Phillips Oppenheim, P. G. Wodehouse —you
might easily make a little list) are relatively
far more popular in Australia than English
writers of the more insular sort.
Why should this be so? I think it is
because the American writers tell a better
story. There may be much that jars on our
prejudices, much that sounds like mere jar-
gon, somewhat of the foreign and strange;
but with American novelists of the average,
as with American dramatists of the average,
the play’s the thing, the style is a
secondary consideration. It even seems
that in America a good style may spoil the
commercial success of a good story. Until
Mr. Cabell made a success of scandal (this
is very quaint) with his inimitable “Jurgen”
in his own country, his admirable earlier
novels were scantily esteemed and little
sought for. “The Rivet in Grandfather’s
Neck,” the finest and truest novel of the South
in our time, is only now winning the success
it merits, though it was published in 1916.
Mr. Hergesheimer, who tells a story well, is
Greek to most casual readers in America,
because the good stories are told in rich
and excellent English. Edgar Allan Poe
told a story with magnificent effect, but he
has never had more than a poor vogue in
America, because he wrote too well. Among
present writers of American fiction, Mr.
Basil King, an intellectual, is more esteemed
in England than in America, and in Australia
he does not sell to any extent worth mention-
ing. However much we love Demos there is
.no getting away from the fact that,
in the commercial sense, illiterate rubbish
succeeds and literary merit goes to the wall.
I suppose it is because our modern systems
of education are so cheap, so perfunctory
and so damnably bad. Sherwood Anderson
and Yachell Lindsay make a moderate suc-
cess, while the late Ella Wheeler Wilcox
sold in millions. Elbert Hubbard’s sales
gushed; Tlioreau’s were never more than a
trickle. Edgar Saltus, master of a style of
delicate and stirring prose almost unique in
America, is still by Americans virtually un-
known, though I remember old R. S. Smythe
going into sober raptures over a Saltus essay
more than 20 years ago.
Why do so many good writers fail in the
market? It isn’t because there are not
enough intelligent readers to make a good
writer’s success. It is rather because, unless
the sale of any book is profitable and immedi-
ate, the publishers drop it. They publish,
say, a good new novel. With review copies and
early sales they dispose of possibly 750 of
an edition of a thousand. Then they
lose interest and chuck out the copies
left over to the old-clothesmen of the
book world. That virtually ends the book.
That is the sort of thing that ended Fitz-
Gerald’s Omar for years, and might have
ended it for ever. It has ended scores of
good novels. Take, as the first to come to
mind, Francis Adams’s “A Child of the Age.”
I read it long ago, and the other day, reacung
it by pure accident again, I was surprised to
find how good it was. The publishers killed
it because it didn’t sell immediately by tne
barrow-load.
Consider the fact that, while cheap Ameri-
can novels of to-day sell by the million, most
of the books that can honestly be classed as
American literature are out of print. Or
think of some novel that you read and en-
joyed keenly 10 years ago, and then wander
round Sydney and try to get a copy of it.
People will tell you that Australians have a
far truer love of verse than the English
have, because this or that Australian versi-
fier sells by the thousand copies, and it
often happens that a book of poems by an
Englishman of merit does not get beyond one
edition of 300 copies or so. It is all twaddle
to talk about Australia’s love of poetry.
What Australia loves is a new sensation,
more especially if it happens to be a fatly
sentimental new >;ensation. But when
there is any possibility of a successful sale,
Australian publishers have more courage
than English publishers: they keep on
hammering at their public. So far as I am
able to discover, no English publisher ever
dreams of pushing a book of verse, and very
few English publishers will take the risk of
issuing one at their own cost. There’s “no
money” for the publisher in anything short
of a sensational sale, and the average Eng-
lish writer, denied all fair chance of testing
the public esteem of his work, starves, or
merely writes as a sideline. I suppose
that C. J. Dennis made more money out of
“The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke” than
the late Austin Dobson made out of all the
delightful boks of verse he ever published.
Are you going to ascribe that fact to Den-
nis’s superiority over Austin Dobson? Bet-
ter be honest, and admit that Dennis made
his success because he had the luck to find
a publisher who was game to tickle and
exploit a sentimental public. It is a sort
of luck that has fallen to few Australian
writers. The Bulletin published a book
of verses deemed suitable for recitation many
years aero, and then sold the whole thing
to a publisher. Most of us had bits of one
sort and another in that book, and we got one
dividend from The Bulletin, I remember;
but we didn’t get so much as a complimen-
tary copy when the publisher began to pour
out his little lot.
FRANK MORTON.
Burying the Past
Australia has always been afflicted with
an undue proportion of croakers who
told everyone who would listen to them that
the country had no present and no future
worth bothering- much about. The same sort
of people has been responsible for the notion
that she has no past that would stand worry-
ing much about. Things are improving; for
instance, the school-books now recognise that
there is such a thing as Australian history,
though some of them are not very enthusi-
astic about it. But the interest in the past
shown by people at large is languid indeed
compared with that of, say, the United
States. In the U.S.A. all sorts of little high-
and-dry New England towns like Salem
and New Bedford, to say nothing of Boston
and such places, have historical museums
and real, live historical societies. And their
museums contain, as Robert McNab found,
a deal of valuable material about the begin-
nings of the pakehas in Maoriland. Inci-
dentally, there’s probably a lot of good stuff
about early Australia there, too, but no one
has gone after it.
Australia has the Mitchell Library be-
cause a private citizen happened to make a
hobby of collecting Australiana, and was
public-spirited enough to leave it to the
country. Apart from that, it hasn’t a his-
torical museum at all. Its chief historical
society, the R.A.H.S., has a good deal of
valuable historical material, and would have
had more given to it if it had anywhere to
put it, but its only place is a room lent by
the Education Department. Things have
been looking up with the society, though,
and it has about 800 members, nearly one
out of every 2500 inhabitants in N. S.
Wales. The Victorian society hasn’t a
quarter as many.
No Australian University has a chair for
Australian history. Both Prof. Wood, of
Sydney Uni., and Ernest Scott, of Mel-
bourne, have done a good deal for the sub-
ject, but it has been on the side and as
a sort of hobby. There’s a movement to get
such a chair at Sydney, with some hopes
of success. It would be too much to expect
Melbourne with its largely imported pro-
fessorate to take much official notice of such
a mere Australian subject.
As to our multitudinous Governments,
they do quite as much as can be expected
of them. The Commonwealth brings out
each year several volumes of historical re-
cords, and expends on them about one-twenty-
fifth of the cost of keeping up the mostly
useless and not specially ornamental Aus-
tralia House in London. Tasmania has a
records officer who spends the time not
wanted for publicity work and other stunts
in indexing, overhauling and fixing up the
State’s fairly complete set of historical docu-
ments. The other five States don’t do any-
thing in particular, but valuable historical
stuff isn’t burned or torn up or taken away
and sold in the light-hearted way that it
used to be.
Just as Australia is the one continent
with one language, and for all practical
purposes one race, so it is the one continent
with a clear, unbroken record (but for a
few links dropped by carelessness but not
yet beyond recovery) of its history since
the beginnings of settlement. Those who want
pre-history and plenty of room for le-tting
imagination supply the place of facts needn’t
go short, for there is plenty of space in the
history of our abo.-predecessors. It is true
that some legends about our more recent
history have gained pretty general accept-
ance, but that is largely due to the neglect
of the original sources, which was wide-
spread until recently, and is not extinct
even now.
The drama of the winning of a continent
and of the founding and development of a
new nation, all played out in the full light
of day, is big and stirring enough to be
worth a lot more attention and interest
than it receives. And if anyone wants pic-
turesqueness and sensation Australian his-
tory is saturated through and through with
it. There are all the wild tragedy, the horror
and the buffoonery of the convict days,
the heroism of the early explorers
and of the pioneers, the romance of the
digging days, the greatest gold rush that the
w r orld has seen. Pirates, bushrangers and
the like are thrown in for good measure.
And as a climax to the drama came the
part that Australians played in the war.
As for comic relief, most of our political
issues, our seven Parliaments, W. M.
Hughes, the administration of the War Pre-
cautions Act, and, in particular, the censor-
ship can supply it in full measure.
DONALBAIN.
The Matter of the Verb
When men first began to write they got
an idea of the consonants before they dis-
covered that vowels were necessary. A
vowel was just a vowel and apparently might
carry any sound which was full enougli to
prop up the adjacent consonants. Short-
hand caught something of the same idea in
modern times; but the more remarkable
recent development is the tendency to remove
the verb from the sentence. In Latin the
verb comes at the end; and a writer like
Cicero could write a whole page of which
the meaning was more or less in suspense
until the principal verb flashed in sight and
illuminated the whole. Many of our novel-
ists go a lot further than that. Take an
example:
Garulinda with the grave sweet looks and a little
pearl of a nose set temptingly between two cheeks
of apple blossom! Garulinda of the memories....
and dark hills all between! • What wonder like
Garulinda’s blue eyes....and soft hands....and silk
stockings? Apparently of all hopes and fears,
trials and vexations, gay mornings and delicate lilac
evenings—nothing.”
Garulinda’s sisters read such stuff with
strange rapture. That it doesn’t mean any-
thing and doesn’t- suggest anything definite
matters nothing. Soalcinia lays down? the
book with a delicate lilac sigh and sweet
grave looks. “How that man can write!”
she cries. “It is wonderful —wonderful!”
Many of the critics quite agree with the dear
girl; in fact, a book that didn’t have a pas-
sage of the sort on every second or third page
would be described as possessing no style.
I suspect any man who in writing leaves
the verb out of his sentence. Here and there
by way of sudden exclamation it is all right;
but in descriptive passages it is all wrong.
A thought is not complete until the verb
gives it meaning. The embroidery of adjec-
tives may be present or not, but nouns and
verbs are essential to saying anything real
at all. Plainly, the writer who leaves out
his verbs does not do so to make his meaning
clearer; and any trick of word arrangement
which is not designed to do that is more or
less dishonest. Honesty is the real basis of
style. The beautiful in writing is the lucid;
and all twists, turns, tricks and verbiage
which hold the reader one* instant longer
from the writer’s meaning than is absolutely
necessary are mere literary dirt.
P. J. Q.
Our Teaching of English
The positive information a student pos-
sesses at the end of his school career mat-
ters very little; his attitude of mind mat-
ters a great deal. If he has acquired even
a tolerable interest in literature he has a
standard of judgment which will save him
from the utterly worthless in books, and
possibly bring him to a nice discrimina-
tion between Effie Adelaide Howlands and
Thomas Hardy, Hall Caine and Joseph Con-
rad, Ella Wheeler Wilcox and Rupert
Brooke. To a student leaving school em-
bittered and stunned after a long course
of dissection of Chaucer, the immortal Wil-
liam, Carlyle, Ruskin and one of the
drearier more or less modern novelists, it
is infinitely soothing to fall into the arms
of Ethel M. Dell, or to hobnob with the
miscellaneous contributors to the Movie
Magazine or the Midday Moon.
English as a subject of 'examination has
been liberalised of late years. At lgast, in
theory. The syllabus in English for Vic-
torian public examinations reads inno-
cently, leaves a good deal of opportunity for
choice, and looks liberal.
But, then, there is the Examination
Board, and there is the teacher. The
teacher is a product of Examination Boards
—a strange being produced by innumerable
conflicts with examiners. Both of these
view literature from the dissector’s angle.
The teacher selects the texts for the year,
and, naturally, uses those he has most care-
fully probed and disjointed in his own
“course.” He tackles his year’s work of
laying bare the mechanism of “Hamlet” or
“Lear” with all the zest of a surgeon en-
gaged on a major operation. As an “aid”
there is a really first-class text-book on
“Shakspearean Tragedy” which will explain
why, how and when William wrote it, what
the tragedy is, how much there is of it and
why it isn’t better tragedy. At the end
of the year the student may or may not
have read “Hamlet” or “Lear”; but he
understands tragedy so well that he wants
no more of it.
As a relaxation from the tragic, there is
naturally a lighter side to the year’s course
—say, a delicate slice of Chaucer, Thack-
eray’s “Henry Esmond” and selected essays
by Bacon, Addison, Macaulay, Ruskin and
Carlyle. But it is unfortunate that the
output of “literature” ceased 50 or more
years ago. Shakspeare is the only drama-
tist: there have been no poets since Words-
worth and Tennyson: while in the lighter
section Hardy and Meredith, not to men-
tion Kipling, Wells, Hewlett and Conrad,
don’t exist. This makes a hiatus. As
already mentioned, the fall from Shaks-
peare to “Canary Cottage” is sudden but
soothing.
For all that, there isn’t a great deal
wrong with the syllabus: the fault is with
the examiners and the teachers. They
need educating.

“Pat Bushie”: “Bog’s” harassed train-
travelJers (B. 27/4/’22) are not alone in
their misery. Going from Bourke (N.S.W.)
to Cobar you have to waste two days at
Nyngan, because a thoughtful Department
sees that the train from Bourke misses the
Cobar train by 30 minutes. And it is the
same from Cobar to Bourke.

“Phalanger”: Queensland Government has
its own way of providing for the unem-
ployed. Recently a Gazette notice pro-
claiming a three months’ close season for
opossums and other native animals was
rescinded so that 6000 out-of-works might
find toil. By wiping out the close season
the Government is going a long way towards
wiping out the opossum, and thereby landing
the 6000 unemployed in a condition of per-
manent unemployment. But the ’possum
hasn’t a vote.

"The Wanderer” : “Cambronne” must have
tried (B. 4/5/’22) every brand of Austra-
lian axe-handle but the right one. On the
Bulga (N.S.W.) they make axe-handles that
beat the Yankee product out of sight. The
Bulga plateau contains some of the best
timber —hard and soft woods—-in the world.
But it has been sinfully neglected by the
Sydney Government, and its resources have
been criminally wasted. When the rail-
way, promised a decade* ago, materialises
there will probably be only a few burnt logs
to show where the giants of the forest once
stood in all their glory.

“Morehead”: Bill unearthed Jeanette in
a Paris scent shop while on leave in 1916,
and married her after the Armistice. His
parents didn’t like the prospect at all, hav-
ing imbibed some early-Victorian ideas about
the French “jeune fille’s” extravagance and
general frivolity. However, Bill brought
her back, and, with the aid of the Repat.
and his war gratuity, started a hairdressing
saloon. And that is where Madame has
proved an asset. She can lather up and
shave as dexterously as Bill, and, not know-
ing the language too well, she doesn’t roar
out the latest certainties to the annoyance
as well as the financial detriment of the
firm’s patrons.

“Beal”: There are axe-handles and axe-
handles (B. 4/5/’22). We have plenty of
blue-gum (E. globulus) and spotted-gum
(E. maculata), both suitable woods. I have
had a blue-gum handle in a 141 b. sledge-
hammer for 18 months, and it is still quite
good. Yet we have broken three hickory
handles in as many weeks in a lOlb. sledge;
and we paid top prices, too. I have discarded
hickory in favor of a blue-gum handle in the
10-pounder. Indiscriminate use of unsuit-
able timbers is chiefly responsible for the
prejudice against the Australian article.

“Wilfrido”: An M.L. farmer, hard hit by
falling prices, was forced to sell his stock.
He managed to hold on to the-farm, hoping
that the Government would come to his
aid. As he waited, the grass grew on the
stockless selection, and it occurred to him
that the seed might be marketable. Presently
he discovered that before he bought the place
the whole of it had been sown with fescue,
which had risen in value from 6d. to Is. 4d.
per lb. He harvested hastily, with all the
help he could hire, and the return was £4600
net - , With that he purchased the freehold
and had £lOOO left to help him re-stock.

Gouger : A Chinese packman showed a
Queensland policeman a neat opium-smug-

Die policeman stopped him i.n the bush about
40 miles from Cooktown, and thoroughly
searched his outfit. Every case, every bag
of flour and sugar was opened and over-
hauled. The lining of the pack-saddles was
prospected for signs of the drug, and so even
were two large jars of rum. J. 'Hop gave
it best at last, and accepted a courteous
invitation to sample the rum. There was a
false bottom in each of those jars, and that’s
where the opium was. Rut the policeman
did not know it. Not until months after-
wards.

Cotton-growing is likely to prove the sal-
vation of more than one distressed Queens-
land industry. The C.Q. district has sent
Rockhampton ginned cotton valued at
£40,060, pickers having made 2d. a lb. with
ease throughout the season. Fifty years
ago HJd. per lb. was obtained for five bales
grown by R. Sparrow at Tenthill, near Gat-
ton. The prize district to-day is Capella,
near Clermont, where the stuff grows in
fine quality and abundance., and runs wild
with little or no provocation. The trium-
phant career of the boll-weevil in America
makes the. cotton outlook good for Queens-
land, provided the boll-weevil and the strike
organiser are kept out.

was a nail. Accidents must happen fre-
quently in that factory.

As a general rule everyone feels less
energetic on Monday than any other day
in the week. This is very aptly termed
Mondayitis. Instead of the week-end rest
bracing up people it has the opposite effect.
The principal reasons for this are an
interruption of the regular habits of living
and over-indulgence in food causing the
liver to become sluggish. In such instances
a dose of Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills
taken before retiring on Sunday night
will prove most beneficial. If you have
never done so try this suggestion, then
note how different you feel on Monday.

Are Your Bowels Like This?
Look at this picture of part of the large in-
testine or lower bowel as it is commonly cailed.
It is packed and bloated with waste food mat-
ter which cannot move out of the system the
way Nature intends it should.
What is the result ?
This waste matter begins to ferment, rot, and
form gases, poisoning the entire system.
Then all the organs of the body will become
more or less deranged and chiefly among these,
the bowels and stomach will suffer.
This may cause obstinate constipation, sour
stomach, gas on the stomach, loss of appetite,
nausea, headache and many other symptoms.
Finally, through the irritation or the gases
caused by the rotting material, or assisted by medi-
cine, the bowel forces part of this foul matter out
of the system, and things are better for a while.
But unless the right treatment is undertaken,
the same condition may occur again and again.
Of course, few bowels get into quite as bad
condition as the one pictured above. Some only
get as bad as the picture shown below.
Here you can see how the old particles of waste food
are sticking to the walls of the large intestine.
In the centre there is still a little passage
through which some of the waste matter is able
to pass out of the system the way it should.
Many persons whose bowels are in this con-
dition don’t realise that they are constipated and
that there is anything the matter with their bowels.
They may have a movement of the bowels
every day and even twice a day, but they never
have a GOOD, THOROUGH, FREE MOVEMENT.
Keep Your Bowels Clean.
That listless, tired, drowsy feeling may be due
to poisonous matter lodged in the bowels.
Many folks who always feel tired and only “half
alive” will be surprised how much better they
will feel when they get rid of this matter which
has been poisoning their system for months.
Nervousness, sleeplessness and some kinds
of headaches are frequently signs of poisoning
of the system through poisons left in the bowels.
Irritation of the bladder, breathlessness, so-
called weak and fluttering heart, are often caused
by pressure of gas in the intestines —this gas
may originate from decaying food in the system.

Watch your bowels carefully.
To avoid and to overcome sickness of all kinds,
watch your bowels. Don’t allow the old fer-

and months, but GET IT OUT.
If your stomach is disordered, or your bowels
constipated, if you feel sluggish, dizzy or bilious,

Chamberlain’s Tablets are good for constipa-
tion, sour stomach and gases on the stomach.
A single dose often relieves these troubles.
The use of these Tablets is not followed by
constipation as is the case with many laxatives.
Instead of weakening the bowels they strengthen
them to act naturally without assistance.
Chronic constipation may be permanently
relieved by Chamberlain’s Tablets. They have
none of the sickening qualities of pills, and do
not produce any unpleasant effect.

“THE RIGHT PLACE TO BUY ENGINES.”
“Rough Herbalist’': One night at mess the
vexed question of to drink or not to drink was
raised, and was argued at length by all and
sundry. Finally I chipped i.n on the side of
booze, and said that, in my opinion, a man
had not completed his education until he had
been stung once or twice. Our padre, a
teetotaller, leaned across to me and remarked
drily, “Then, Herby, I reckon you’re some-
what over-educated.” The Church was one
up.
“Fax” views a fortune in paint: —
The Yan Dyck picture, for which Melbourne
National Gallery has paid 15,000 guineas, plus death
duties, of Felton Bequest money, is absurd in alle-
gorical conception, but it is at any rate a great
piece of full-length portraiture, and a fine example of
drapery painting—a fashionable essential in portrai-
ture in the famous Fleming’s day and afterwards.
Presumably the Countess of Southampton, seated in
the clouds, is a likeness of the lady, whereas Lely’s
alleged portraits of the beauties of Charles ll.’s court
did not pretend to closely resemble the originals.
The Countess appears here as a plump, middle-aged
matron, whose face is set off by the folds of a blue
scarf which floats like a flag on the end of a long
(tick held in her right hand. Her nose is unduly
lean.

by wounds never got badge or buttonhole.
They can have a bit of metal enamel, I be-
lieve, by paying so much a year to some-
thing or other, but most of them just jog
along unostentatiously with the knowledge
that they did their job. I heard one such
insulted on a Melbourne railway platform
the other day by a home-service fire-eater who,
it transpired later, had done his bit in a
naval uniform round about one of the Port
Phillip piers. The other man had pulled
off the D.C.M. at Mens and got his commis-
sion and a Military Cross in the field while
his critic was doing his bit in Australia.
“Ashmead” on irregular war wounds: —
The self-inflicted wound-stunt fci France developed
into an art, as regards the covering-up of
tracks which might lead to a few months’ hard
“yakker.” Those who contemplated the act
usually were aware of the danger of detection
following the discovery of a British instead
of a German bullet, and therefore a piece of shell-
splinter jambed into a cartridge with the bullet re-
moved was usually the instrument of torture. In
order that there should be no singeing of clothing
or scorching of skin around the injured part, it was
found necessary to have a partner to Are the shot.
There were two such who came across my tracks
once, about the time of the Passchendaele disaster.
Call them Hock and Bock. Each had armed himself
with an S.I.W. cartridge, and about zero-hour tossed
up to see who was to serve the other first. Bock
won. When the mob flew the bags Bock went on
ahead. After a few strenuous yards Hock called to
his cobber: “How about it?” “00-ooh, no, wait a
bit,” Bock yelled, anxious as a dentist’s patient to
put off the moment of torture. A hundred yards
further on Hock got tired of waiting and let the
fleeing form have it. A howl of pain was the result,
and while Bock lay writhing on the ground Hock
roared, “Come on, you blanky fool, give us my
issue!” “You go to Hell,” was the response, “lou
cruel blankard, you’ve broke me leg.” And poor old
Hock had to go and take his chance with the rest of
us.
“Suau” (Port Moresby) puts the Cau-
casian view:—
The remarks of “The Reefer” (B. 23/3/’22) anent
piebald marriages in Papua and the law that pre-
vents divorce of the erring colored wife show only
one side of the question. The point he has over-
looked is the fact that Australia’s oldest oversea
possession does not wish to acquire a mixed brood
of half-castes, whether as the result of sanctified
unions or the other sort. The Mexican Greaser is
not a desirable citizen; nor is the Eurasian the
kind of human that India requires to hold that im-
portant part of the Empire together. Australia
cherishes the doctrine of a pure white race that will
in time fill the continent from shore to shore.
Colored and multi-colored folk are not considered
worth while in the future development of the
Mother Continent, and Papua follows the lead of
the thinkers on the other side of the Coral Sea in
this important respect. Papua is held for Aus-
tralia by only a little more than 1000 white people,
and the grip is based mainly on prestige, armed might
being absent. Let the dominant race once mix
with the Stone Age savage, and the respect and
obedience so hardly won by the pioneers must depart.
What is really wanted is a law that goes further
than merely preventing divorce of the unwanted
brown woman. Experience shows that the white
man does not lift the brown woman to his own
plane, but rather that the companionship of the
savage tends to drag him down. The average
“Combo” is an abominable character who, in the
words of an old hand, “takes on all the mentality
of a blackfellow’s dog” after a few years’ life with
a native. He is a calamity that needs to be dis-
couraged legislatively and otherwise, as much as
possible, not only in the interests of his possible
progeny but in those of the country he pollutes.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We sit and talk. “I say, my dear,
’Tis 40 years ago
Since you began appearing here
With Teddy in the show.
’Twas at the Royal. You were then
Just 20, you told me.
Some six years later, was it, when
You came out here to play again,
And you were 23?
“Another five years. You were here
With Bron’s Burlesques. You said
You then were 24, I fear.
When five years more had fled
You were, as you informed the press,
Then 25. None bears
As well as you the storm and stress
Of time. You are, I must confess,
Too young far for your years.
“You came again in five years, Flo,
And you were 29.”
She shakes her head. “That is not so.”
Her hand is pressed on mine;
She turns on me her trusting eyes:
“T’was 28, no more,
Nine years ago.” She softly sighs.
“Alas! old darling, how time flies—
That makes me 34!”

A Medical Scientist recently demonstrated that the
nutritious elements in Cod Liver Oil are consider-
ably greater than in a food so rick in fat as butter.
This discovery reveals the secret of the phenomenal
success and popularity of HYPOL, which contains
50/ of the finest Cod Liver Oil from the Norwegian
Fisheries, but blended so skilfully with the hypo-
phosphites of lime, potash and soda, and so en-
ticingly flavoured, that it is just as pleasant to take
as it is wholesome.
Doctors recommend HYPOL largely for the following
Complaints, and it never fails :
Coughs
Colds
Bronchitis
Pneumonia
Anaemia
Debility
Influenza
Nerve*
Measles
Rickets
Loss of Weight
Whooping Cough
There’s some distinction and originality about HYPOL.
Substitutes are “not as good.”

“The Oldest Inhabitant” :
In the first ’forties John Baptist, a Portuguese,
had a market garden on Surry Hills in connection
with which he opened a stall in the old George-
street markets for the sale of vegetables. His
manager was one Patrick Stanley, who in later years
became an alderman and Mayor of Redfern. When
the Baptists ceased from nurserying Stanley took
over the markets business, and when the old mar-
kets were demolished he moved his business into
George-street, where his son conducts it. Not often
is a trade in perishable goods carried on 80 years
in the same place.
“Rudolph Rhapsody”: Some of Sydney’s
purveyors of the peanut and banan’ are old
hands. Nieola Beanco, for instance, who
runs a stall alongside the sea-wall at the
Botanic Gardens’ gate, on the east side of
Farm Cove, has been there for 25 years. He
came to Australia 30-years ago, and was 44
then. Last week a client told him she
remembered buying fruit from him when, as
a girl of 18, she was wandering through the
gardens with her sweetheart. This time she
purchased bananas for a four-year old grand-
child.
A Port Moresby housewife finds a
“general” :
First, I showed him how to set the table, and
next morning, when I walked into the breakfast-
room, I found he had balanced the knives, forks
and spoons on top of the cups and milk jugs, and
had placed the cups on soup-plates instead of on
saucers. Later I set him to scrub the verandah.
After a long time I went out to inquire where he
was, and found him sound asleep on a dry patch in the
centre of the wet portion. It transpired that, having
scrubbed all round himself, he found he couldn’t
move without walking on his nevdy-washed floor, so
just slept to pass the time away while it dried. After
I had taught him to cook various small things, such
as potatoes and pumpkin, I showed him how to
roast and left him to do the beef, while I attended
to other matters. In a little while I heard violent
screams from the kitchen and on rushing out I found
him about to put the cat into the oven. “Nivani,”
. I shrieked, “what are you doing with that cat ?”
“Me, sinabada, I put em pussy-cat ’long oven; ’spose
he cook good, all right—l put ’em meat inside he
all right. Savvy?’’ A few weeks later I told him to
pluck a fowl and he pulled all the feathers off the
poor bird before killing it. That was the last straw.
Next day I took him up to the court and signed off
a veiy mournful boy, who wondered w'hat was wrong
in taking the “leaves’’ off a fowl before killing it.
Dido : The fire at the Melbourne seaside
residential hotel had got a good hold before
the lodgers began to sit up and take
notice, and the fireman who went first up
, ® ladder to the little side balcony col-
lected two young women (barmaids) and,
thirdly, Macnamarra, who was in a long
white nightshirt, and who, it would seem,
had gone to bed with one nightcap on and
nine in. He was set down before the house,
a. quaint, lank Scot, in his all-embracing
shirt. Then an alarm in front drew atten-
tion from him. How he got back into the
house nobody knew, but presently, amid cries
of alarm, he reappeared at the balustrading
ol the first small balcony, a drawn-out, smok-
in£. scotch object. Again a young fireman
sprinted up to the rescue. He brought
Macnamarra down, looped over one shoulder,
and Mack was still smoking and was so
singed that his long nightshirt fell from him
as he descended. Once more he stood on
terra firnia. He opened his hand explana-
torily. I had to gang awa’ back for ma
tooth-brush, laddie,” he said.
“Herodot” on tangled skeins :
The case mentioned by “Eightensix”, (B. 4/5/’22),
in which a 3'oung wife’s middle-aged husband cleared
out with his mother-in-law, is not unique. Many will
remember a Sydney Supreme Court petition in which
the idles were reversed—the daughter of a woman
who had married for the second time having departed
for parts unknown in company with the second hus-
band, a comparatively young man. About the time
this case was heard a well-known English lady
novelist petitioned for the dissolution of her second
marriage, on the grounds that her husband had
transferred his affections to her daughter. More un-
usual still, however, are some divorce proceedings
imminent in Victoria. Fifteen years or so ago a
married couple separated after about three months’
wedded bliss. Four years later the wife got a
decree against the husband for desertion. Subse-
quently both married again, and in the course of
time each acquired a family. They met again, not
long ago, and now the man’s second wife is petition-
ing to be freed from her bonds with him by reason
of his misconduct with his long-divorced first spouse.
Simultaneously the woman’s second husband has fired
in a writ asking for a divorce from her on the
grounds of her adultery with her first husband.
“Blackfriars”: David Syme once singed bis
fingers hanging on, as a boss “corner”-man,
to the bulk of Victoria’s butter yield, just as
the pool has done more recently. I found
an Age scribe penning an article which
soundly trounced the “corner,” affirming that
while local consumers had been kept short
the cool stores were reeking with a rancid
accumulation. “But David’s the head and
shoulders and stomach of the butter corner,”
I pointed out. “I know all that,” said the
other cheerfully, “but the old man dictated
practically every word of this to me him-
self. He did it without a smile.”

Ben is a dustman only, yet
A rare philosopher is he.
Strange premonitions he can get,
And peoples’ fates and fortunes see
Set forth in humble rubbish-tins,
Or in the contents of their bins.
Three several times Ben said to Joe,
When tipping tins into the cart:
“These ain’t got very long to go ;
Briggs and his wife is bound to part.”
Like reading fortunes from the hand,
Ben seemed the case to understand.
But Joseph started, as though shot,
When in the press he saw it plain
How Mrs. Briggs had lately got
Divorced from Briggs. And once again
Said Joe: “Ole Ben’s a prophet what
Could teach them palmisters a lot.”
Said Joe to Ben: “ ’Ow is it done ?”
Ben smiled in his slow, subtle way.
“It’s very plain to me, old son,
You didn’t notice every day
As how their rubbish-tin,” says he,
“Was filled with broken crockery!”

“Jack Hogan” sums up our descendants
of the Capsars :
“P. Airey” may well raise his hat to Giuseppe
ind Antonio (B. 4/5/’22) as hustling immigrants.
Uowadays every inward Orient liner conveys a big
Italian quota. A few years ago the good money to
be earned on the goldfields wood-lines made W.A.
the goal of many ; then there were rows with returned
soldiers, and after a Dago had fatally stabbed a Digger
during a Kalgoorlie brawl, anyone possessing an
alive complexion was regarded with hostility and
most of the Romans cleared out. Some of these are
now returning, but they avoid W.A. Their remarkable
calm and patience while complying with immigra-
tion regulations contrasts with the undisciplined con-
duct of the British immigrants, who surge around
the passport offices like riotous schoolboys. The
average shipment of Italians consists of about one
for W.A., ditto for South Aus.. 15 for Vic., 20 for
N.S.W. (fruiterers and steak-er-da-oyst), and 90 for
the sugar stunt in Queensland. These contingents
have been regularly arriving during the past couple
of years, and hundreds are waiting their turn at
Naples, fares in hand. Australia has been advertised
so well in Italy that at Naples berths have to be
booked six months ahead. Have you ever seen a
Dago out of work?

If you are fond of drawing you can
easily be (aught how to make money in
your own home. There is such a constant
demand for new sketches that persons of
very moderate ability earn good fees.
But to get the best results you should
learn direct from a successful artist.
Under Mr. J. C. Bancks, the well-known
cartoonist and caricaturist, and by his easy
system of lessons by post, many persons
of both sexes are now being trained to
do money-earning sketches.
Mr. Bancks himself supervises every
student's work and personally corrects
and advises them by letter on each lesson.
Why Don’t
YOU Learn?
The Bancks School gives the finest prac-
tical instruction to be had in Australia,
and the terms are very easy.
Send your name and address (with 3d.
in stamps for postage), and the booklet
“Art that Pays” will be posted to you. It
tells you all about the School. If you can
already draw a little and you like to send
a specimen of your work (either original
or a copy) Mr. Bancks will be very pleased
to write you his opinion of it— free.
But write for the book now, and judge
for yourself.

The Pioneer Players, in whose plan for the
occasional production of purely Australian
drama lurks the germ of financial success,
staged their first attempt at Melbourne
Playhouse last week. ‘‘The Battler,” by
Louis Esson, strikes the right note, although
the blow is insufficiently hard. To the
bleached skeleton of a dead mining field,
where the now-decrepit pub used to take
£l4O on Saturday night, comes George
Ogilvie, an honest booster with a wondrous
fund of energy to back his optimism—the
same old George who had helped shake
things up 40 years ago. A mine in W'estralia
lias enriched George for the moment, and
like a fairy godfather he returns to the lure
of other days, intent on bringing more gold
to light. Word comes that the bottom lias
dropped out of his Westralian spec., but in-
domitable George strikes a rich patch down
in the old gully, and inspires the local popu-
lation (only 10 are visible in Esson’s
comedy) to dreams of wealth and progress.
Then the rich patch goes suddenly bald, just
as good news from the. West starts George
on a journey back to the scene of a new
find. There’s the whole plot of Esson’s slim
and graceful little comedy. The end leaves
things exactly as they were in the beginning,
except that Clara has successfully hooked
Watty meanwhile. Two crumbling fossick-
ers on a log in the foreground are the first
and the last words in the entertainment.
George, the battler, is an exhilarating
figure, supported by a small collec-
tion of character sketches. The types are
truthful, as far as they go. The dialogue
has “atmosphere” in it. Padded with fur-
ther talk, furnished with brisker action,
better tableaux, and given a few definite in-
dications of a large population, on a larger
stage, “The Battler” would be an attractive
sample of the class of stage goods which
will p: eseutly be produced in this country as
a matter of course. The performance at the
Playhouse was more lacking in experience
than in capacity. George Dawe, in the
name-part, handsome, expansive and mag-
netic, shone among the surrounding ama-
teurs. Frank Iveon, Charles Doherty and
Leo Burke were something more than merely
satisfactory, whilst two aged fossickers and
a loud, unaccountable auctioneer (the only
unconvincing character in the show) held

A revival of “You’re in Love,” at Mel-
bourne Majesty’s, was undeserving of more
its appointed six nights. The meagre
story lives, moves and has its being on the
silly assumption that a saucy young woman
and a sane young man could let themselves
Ik 1 bound by a prohibitive marriage contract,
contrived by a terrible aunt who imitates
the querulous accents of Connie Ediss. The
inanities of this assumption, together with
the cautious wanderings of Maude Fane, in
an alleged somnambulistic state, to the end
of a pole projected over the front stalls, cou-
stitute most of the entertainment. For the
rest, there is a beautifully-decorative acro-
batic dance by Madge Elliott find Cyril
Ritchard (who presents an insufficiently
virile impersonation of Maude Fane’s
baffled bridegroom), a few fugitive appear-
ances of Alfred Frith as a scarecrow mission-
ary with a face which he holds in profile
when his mouth is shut, and turns grimace-
fully to the audience when he talks; to-
gether with a small assortment of insipid
minor characters, among whom Kellaway
gets no chance to distinguish himself as lie
did in “A Night Out,” clever dancing by Rita
Nugent, Hooker and Harker, also a chorus
and ballet remarkable for their fleeting
charm of youthfulness. The J.C.W. c. and
b. damsels grow younger and more sponta-
neously joyous every year, but the Firm must
beware of a temptation to rob the kinder-
garten for musical-show purposes. As it is.
the nonage of these pretty little bits of
precocity-—the best stage bits, probably, in
the wide world- —throws the make-up of the
young-part lady principals into bold relief.
The suggestion of fading roses in a gardenful
of buds strikes one rather painfully. Two
more nights of “You’re in Love” will pre-
cede a revival on Saturday of “Going Up,”
to enable Frith to farewell in his most
effective part.
“The Bat” continues its campaign of mys-
tification. and several outside inquirers are
said to lie going frequently to Melbourne

The great heart of the multitude went out
to Toscha Seidel at the Melbourne Town
Hall on Saturday night. Short, stocky and
heavy of jaw, he is the physical and tempera-
mental opposite of Heifetz, who fiddled on
the same platform two or three months ago.
With his opening number on Saturday—
Vitali’s Chaconne, sub-edited by Charlier —
he aroused a hurricane of applause, beside
which the row that greeted Heifetz was like
a school-girl’s “Hurrah.” The piece was
faultlessly played, as was the familiar Men-
delssohn Concerto in E Minor, in which the
bow raced on . a demented adventure or
slowed down to the slow rhythm of a nona-
genarian verger proceeding to kirk. Beet-
hoven’s Romance in G Major, wherein the
breadth and richness of Seidel’s tone were
fully exhibited, caused another deafening out-
break. Kreisler’s arrangement of Schubert’s
Ballet music for the deceased and forgotten
opera of “Rosamunde,” followed by the Hun-
garian Dance No. 1 (Brahms-Joachim) and
Sarasate’s Gipsy Airs, gave the crowd some
musical fireworks. The artist scored most
in the Schubert-Kreisler item, but Sarasate’s
devious melodies seemed more suited to bis
fancy. Seidel, who is impeccably accom-
panied by Frank Hutchens, gives his third
recital this evening, and further appearances
are down for next Saturday and Tuesday.
“Rogues and Romance” gets the popular
verdict at Melbourne Majestic this week. It
is a slab of Spanish melodrama, wherein
lovely June Caprice adds to the warmth of
the proceedings. The doctrines of the late
S. Smiles are fervidly illustrated in the
other Majestic feature, “Hold Your Horses.”
Tom Moore, as the humble hero, only takes
about five reels to help himself to a fine
heiress and a place in society. Another waif,
with the soul of an angel and the velvet
manner of a manicurist, has turned up in
the person of Gladys Walton at Hoyt’s De
Luxe. She is called “The Rowdy,” but. has
been liberally fed on Pollyanna treacle. On
the same screen Mitchell Lewis demonstrates
a lumberman’s hatred of peaceful arbitra-
tion in the vigorous “Children of Banish-
ment.” Also Wm, 11. Tooker, the hero of
the popular “Humoresque,” has another
burst of glory in “The Power Within.” At
the Melba Thomas Meighan leaves Bohemia
for bathos as “A Prince There Was,” whilst
the Britannia is starring the spirit of a
murderer in the solemn and spooky “Earth-
bound.”
At Melbourne King’s a new and unex-
pected show succeeds “The First Year” on
Saturday. Its title is “The Humphrey
Bishop Comedy and Operatic C 0.,” and it is
stated in th ( e advt. to comprise 18 star acts.

At Melbourne Tivoli the restrained art of
George Carney gets ampler recognition, and
the grotesque humor of Barton continues to
centre in an inhuman disguise and a coat
of many tatters. The strong, honest voices
and strenuous warbling of Pollard and
White are a notably tuneful feature of a
bill which will be bereft of the Two noisy,
nifty ragtime Rascals after to-night.

On some Adelaide shows —
The Repertory Theatre gave Shaw’s “Pygmalion”
at Unley Town Hall (no more central building-
being available) before a packed house, lvv Stacey
was just It as the promoted flower-girl, best per-
haps at the stage where she uttered atrocious vul-
garisms in an ultra-refined voice. The sanguinary
adjective caused the customary sensation. Wilfred
Neill played the Pygmalion hero (on his own
characteristic lines) with steady' success; Basil Har-
ford and Kitty Sullivan used their beautiful voices
with effect, and Ethelwyn Robin stood out in the
too-short housekeeper part. Ray Walsh produced,
but did not act. The audience seemed puzzled by
the inconclusive ending, being mostly unaware that
the author himself has taken a dozen pages of small
print to argue how things probably turned out.
Marie Tempest, at the Royal, made the speech
which Adelaide always demands from a visiting actor
at the end of the season, and was good enough to
give the place an excellent character for intellect.
She was seen at the top of her form in “Mr Pirn,”
and its light humor was admirably brought out by-
Marie Ney, Frank Allanby and Jarry. Graham
Browne in this bill put up a fine double, as tiie
lovable but thick-headed squire, and in a curtain-
raiser as a rough-tongued navvy. lie showed great
power in the latter part. The latest melodrama at
the Prince of Wales is chiefly remarkable for a
gorgeous, all-in fight, which fairly wrecks the stage,
and the King’s programme gets added variety from
the trapeze work of Delinda and the comedy of
“Tubby" Stevens. Pictures are really attractive.
The York shows at last the famous American allegory
“Experience,” in which Youth and Love for a time
lose each other. At Wondevgrapli “The Little Minis-
ter” comes somewhere near to Barrie’s story, but
“Anatol” at the Pav. Americanises the Viennese
original out of sight. At West’s is a remarkable
drama, “Wet Gold,” with photographs, apparently
genuine, of the bottom of the sea.
The laughter of “The White-headed Boy,”
at Sydney Palace, will only lie heard for a
few more nights. The Players are rehears-
ing “Harvest,” and that is a very grim
affair indeed.
"My Lady’s Dress” will return to the
wardrobe to-morrow night. On Saturday
Emelie Polini and Frank Harvey appear
with a strong company in Gregan McMahon’s
“The Lie.”
Those who haven’t made the acquaintance
of "A Little Dutch Girl” have only three
nifrhts and one afternoon left to turn their
binoculars on tier. A revival, for three
nights only, of “Firefly” will be staged at
Her Majesty’s on Monday.
Wirths’ big Sydney Hippodrome is hous-
ing the Sistine Choir this week. Inside the
garish circus, the singers under the flood of
white light, look rather like a band of early
Christians making music to keep up their
spirits while the lions are whetting their
appetites off stage. The choristers gave a free
entertainment one afternoon last week for
nuns only, and the immense building was
packed.
Louis Bemiison remains as fresh and
quaint as ever in “Johnny, Get Your Gun,”
at Sydney Royal. On his present form he
looks like staying for months.
Two local lasses who have a future, if
they don’t get married and turn their atten-
tion to babies and recipes, will hold the floor
at Sydney Oonservatorium to-morrow night.
They are Ila Turnbull, a mezzo-soprano, who
in 1921 won the Corn’s first singing diploma,
an; Dorothy Gibbes, winner of the first
teaching diploma for the piano in 1920, and
now on the Corn’s teaching staff.

Talbot O’Farrell, the corpulent comedian
and sentimental warbler who almost mon-
opolises Sydney Tivoli bill-board, has huge
crowds alternately shouting at his witti-
cisms and weeping at the pathos of his vocal
efforts. The “also-rans” make no preten-
sions to greatness, but they are pleasing one
and all, the graceful caprices of Henry de
Bray and May Vivian being particularly
endurable.

An Old Hand holds an inquest on a Syd-
ney art show : •
The Society of Women Painters’ Exhibition at the
Education Gallery was an improvement on last year s
effort. The general standard about equalled that of
the Royal Art Society, and was not much below the
average of the Society of Artists with its half-
dozen best left out. Taken in the mass the work lacks
strength, as so much of our art does. It disclosed
no definite aim beyond that of turning out attractive
wall-decorations. However, apart from the small
section who deal in sentimentalities, the few who.
like Miss Thea Proctor, make scrupulously clean and
well-drawn lint Hat washed-out “studies” ; and the
one or two, like Mrs. Rix Nicholas, who with smash-
ing paint-strokes would demonstrate their mascu-
linity, there was a healthy attempt at realism. Notably
in the eases of Miss Constance Moser, Miss C. E.
James and Miss Nina Stoddart. Miss Moser is more
interested than her fellow exhibitors in tone —that
oft-neglected but all-important dimension by which
alone the suggestion of actual space and atmosphere
and receding form is possible. But false patches,
more readily seen in darks about the edges of trees
and the like, destroy the unity of her compositions.
She would do well to abandon the practice of work-
ing her pictures up from memory. And the same
remark applies to others. How much better, for
example, Miss Mabel Barling- might have- done had she
dropped the idea of telling a story round her lions
and painted them, instead, at Taronga Park. The
one atmosphere she knows, but that of an ancient
arena she is only in a position to guess at.
Miss James seems little concerned with technique.
She is more careful than Miss Moser, but is handi-
capped by a too-limited range from light to dark.
Miss Stoddart makes her desired realism impossible
by an over-conscious handling of her paint and a
fondness for sweet but unreal color.
The striking pictures of Mrs. Rix Nicholas were
chiefly notable for a technique so obviously applied
for the love of it, as 'to absorb whatever interest her
subject possesses. The only thing we should get from a
painting is the re-creation of a part of Nature. The
Old Masters never impress us first by their clever
handling of paint. The deft sweep of a paint-
brush is, after all, only a species of sleight-of-hand.
No one wants to see old tricks performed day after
day, month after month. A picture painted on ultra-
modern lines (namely, as an exposition of technique)
is no more than a fixed set; of tricks, and it becomes
as tiresome to live with as a conjurer who nevei
ceases the practice of his futile ait.
THE HUSH PLAYERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Coming down to see the play,
Sang- my heart the whole brown way
“Fairyland with torches white
Gomes to town this little night ;
I shall laugh, for I shall see
Dublin laughing home to me.”
Then I saw the play and heard
Magic of the spoken word- -
Voices out of memory tell
Simple things I loved too well
In the soft, rich tones I knew....
Ah, my father’s eyes were blue !
Did I say the play was good ?
It was home. I think I stood
Somewhere in the parlor there,
By Aunt Ellen’s straight-backed chair.
Tears were in my eyes to see
Ireland laughing home to me.

The Experience of 50,000 Machines
TO date, Dangar, Gedye & Co. have sold over 50,000
Shearing Machines —a record which no house in Australia can
approach. This is because Dangar, Gedye were the pioneers
in introducing shearing machines to Australia, and have been
specialising in this line ever since—for nearly 30 years.
When, therefore, you buy a “Lister” Shearing Outfit for the
coining season, you know that
behind the
IS
are the unique experience and resources inseparable from handling such a prodigious number
of machines. You are getting—free of charge—the unusual service which we alone
can give you.
Some of the men who were among that small but stout-hearted band of shearers
who tried out the machines in the first year or two after their invention are still with Dangar,
Gedye. They, too, are behind the “Lister” Shearing Machines, and from their knowledge
of Australian conditions have developed and improved the Lister so that to-day it
occupies the premier position in the wool-harvesting world. Longer runs without attention,
less upkeep expense, easier adjustments for perfect shearing, are all features in which
“Listers” lead and which you, as a buyer of machines, can best appreciate, pend for our
new catalogue, “Saving £5 on Your Handpieces Alone,” and say how many stands you
would like quoted for.

DRY IMPERIAL
Exquisite
“Trim” : Audrey Anderson, wlio was shot
dead by her in Melbourne last
week, is not to'be confused with the Audrey
Anderson who married an American beauty-
actor after touring the U.S. in "The Mas-
querader,” with Guy Bates Post. The living
Audrey, whose name was Hay before she
took to the stage, is the daughter of a lady
who made a lot of money out of a seaside
boarding-house and still runs a similar home
for enlarged appetites at St. Kilda. Audrey
had every encouragement from her intelli-
gent mamma, and it was not long before
Gregan McMahon spotted her talent and
tried her with success on the Repertory
stage. Subsequently her style took the fancy
of Guy Post, and she went to America with
his company, where, after understudying
Mrs. Post, she took over the leading part.
Some time ago the lady played with her
husband in the American production of
“Mecca.” and the man was greatly embar-
rassed by the fulsome admiration of Elinor
Glyn. Elinor breaks out periodically in
large-type full-page articles; in the Yankee
press, praising some popular identity who
has taken her eye. One of her victims was
the picture-actor, Tom Mix, who must have
blushed at the frankness of Elinor’s worship.

the more marked

with O’Farrell,
who tries for most
of his effects by
“coming over the

were, and speaking
familiarly to con-
ductor and audi-
ence. It would be

“O.lv. s” theatrical conundrum:—
How came the Grand Guignol shocker, anglicised
under the title of “The Recoil,” to be a Paris
perversion of a playlet written by an Australian a
dozen years ago, but never produced in this country?
The plot of “The Recoil,” staged at the Melbourne
Majesty’s matinee last week as an American adapta-
tion of the French original, shows a savage socialistic
unionist, leader of the malcontents at an electric-
light factory, tearing himself away from a fond wife
in order to attend a strike meeting, whilst their
sleeping child lies perilously sick. The youngster
wakes up with some nameless complaint requiring an
immediate throat operation to save its life. A
doctor is about to perform the dangerous feat when
the light goes out and the child necessarily expires.
Father returns with a triumphant announcement of
how he persuaded the men to destroy some “works”
and put everybody’s light out, whereupon the dis-
tressed wife calls him “murderer” and attacks him
with fine dramatic violence as the curtain falls. Pre-
viously Emma Temple, as a kind-hearted neighbor,
lias called in, and it is she who assists the doctor
in the matter of the operation that couldn’t be com-
pleted owing to the light going out. Emma Temple’s
character is obviously superfluous, the young mother
being equally capable, or more so, of waiting on the
surgeon. The una<ted playlet which J. N. McKenzie
wrote long ago (he sprang the aged manuscript on
the astonished matinee committee when the plot of
“The Recoil” was discussed) included only the Bol-
shevistic worker, wife, child and doctor. McKenzie’s
scheme of mounting and lighting the operation
proceedings was more effective than the Grand Guignol
arrangement as it appeared at Her Majesty's, and his
picture of the return of the wildly-excited husband
was true to life. The distraught mother remained
weeping at her child’s bedside, whilst a calm, col-
lected doctor pointed to the result of the strikers’
inane “triumph.” Thus the original tabloid drama
by McKenzie, the Australian, has suffered by altera-
tion, nevertheless the script practically proves it to
have been the original for the French work. Ilow
did a copy of it get to Paris?
“T. 0.1.”: The first theatre in Newcastle

“Blackfriars” : London beauty-actor Owen
Nares has been lamenting his cruel handicap
of prettiness, which he proclaims has cost
him thousands of pounds. He says that
in taking up an ugly-husband role in Pinero’s
new play he has abandoned for all time his
matinee-idol status. Owen, however, has
been talking very much through his tile.
Henry Ainley was a better-looking chap than
Nares, and he is an almost classical example
of a man who has mixed and goes on mixing
the two occupations of beauty-man and char-
acter-actor. Nothing better in the way of
a character study than his Quinney has
been seen on the Smoketown boards in recent
years. O. Nares’s sentiments would come
a little more convincingly from a man who
was not engaged within the past couple of
years in trading on his looks to the extent
of having a play like “The Charm School,”
with its sickeningly doting bevy of flappers,
built around his main asset. ,
“Pitt Streeter”: If “Blister” is a Mel-
burnian, as I suspect, he may be excused
for saying that Lorna Helms, now playing
the colored help in “The First Year,” made
her first appearance on any stage in “The
Laughter of Fools.” But his statement is in-
correct. Lorna’s professional debut was
made in the latter part of 1920 at the
Palace, Sydney, in a belated war-play called
“The •Luck of the Navy.” Thou eh Adelaide
and Perth likewise sampled the piece, it was
not seen in Melbourne, and Sydney only saw
it for about a fortnight.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” on stage Irish-
men he has met:—
Not many of them have left lasting memories.
The first I can recall was Paddy Gardiner, father of
Mrs. Alfred Phillips, a leading lady in her day. He
played Dr. O’Toole in “The Irish Tutor.” Next
came William Hudson, a gentlemanly actor, sweet
singer and genial companion. He was elderly when
he arrived in Australia, and brought a son, who
remained in Melbourne, entering upon commercial
life. Then John Drew brought us “Handy Andy”
and “The Irish Emigrant.” Drew returned to
America and died in New York, aged 37, the result
of an accident in his own drawing-room. After the
Civil War we had a visit from William O’Neill, who
portrayed the stage Irishman as no Irishman in real
life ever appeared. Billy was at the Battle of Bull
Run, and 1 asked him if he had been one of those
that ran. “Begorra,” was the reply, “those that
didn’t run are there still.” O’Neill, who married
Anna Maria Quinn, struck trouble in Australia, and
died in Fitzroy in the late ’sixties. The greatest
Irish comedian we have had was J. V. Brooke. As
bir Lucius O’Trigger, Pierce O’Hara (“The Irish
Attorney”) and O’Callaghan (“His Last Legs”) lie
was unapproached. Shiel Barry, who made a great
hit in England, in “The Miser,” Richard Stewart
(Nellie’s parent), and William Andrews played well
in Irish parts, but not exclusively. In later years
came Andrew Mack (McAloon) from the States.
Andrew left the old track and brought modern pla.ys
notably “Tom Moore” and “The Way to ICenmare.” ’
“Y.Z.”; They were discussing a local
variety show in a Melbourne bar where
actors on the lower rungs resort. One male
serio-comic bitterly assailed a brother enter-
tainer. “J dunno,” said a casual layman,
"his .farmyard stuff is not bad. I thought
the imitation of a jackass quite lifelike”
"So it is,” snorted the other, “absolutely life-
like. But is it an imitation?”
“Snell”: A large and dreary member of a
distressful German opera company that once
visited Australia possessed a twisted eye-
tooth that stood out from the other grinders
presenting a point like a bayonet. One night
he had to kiss the plump Dresden heroine
a throaty soprano with three chins, and, hi
impetuously attempting the salute, inflicted
a wound, which bled all down the frail’s
face while she went through the rest of the
scene. _ When she staggered off, all gory and
as furious as only a disfigured German prima
donna can be, the others flocked about her
with anxious inquiries. “What eet iss?” they
chorused. “Himmel! Faat haft happen
Then the soprano got off the only joke of
her long professional career. “Cand’t you for
yourselluf see?” she snorted. “I ha'ff been
tusked by der bore.”
“T.W.”: If Melbourne soprano Gertrude
Johnson can throw anything like warmth
into her interpretation of the Queen of
Night music in Mozart’s “Magic Flute,” in
which Covent Garden has just heard her,
she is a lady for whom Britain has been wait-
ing. lima di Murska and recently-dead
Christine Nilsson were the two most famous
exponents of the highest of all coloratura
roles, in parts of which the uppermost F
recurs with a frequency which gives most
singers a. pain in the glottis merely to look
at. Patti might have done the thing exquis-
itely, but she jibbed at all Mozartian parts
except that of Zerlina in “Don Giovanni.”
Considering what an incomprehensible
jumble “The Magic Flute” really is. its hold
is remarkable. Beecham’s crowd did it
many times in the British provinces, and
audiences rushed it even though the Queen
of Night was colorless and apparently dr<”>
sieal, while the scenery invariably got at
cross purpose with the production staff.
“T.W.” : “0.K.” falls into the pardonable
error of calling London’s “Old Vic.” the
Victoria Theatre (B. 11/5/’22). Although
some of the . best Shakspeare and grand
opera now visible in the Grime are performed
in the barn over Waterloo Bridge, it has
for years been without a theatre license.
It scrapes over that obstacle by calling itself
the “Royal Victoria Hall,” and by tamper-
ing harmlessly for a moment or so with
the continuity of the performance.
“Sarc” : Why don’t these imported piano-
thumpers introduce a bit of novelty into
their programmes, and abandon the stereo-
typed sequence of Bach, Schumann, Chopin
and Liszt? One would think that the cold
applause and the “Thank God, that’s over!”
expression which follow the performance of
the old junk would shake them out of this
slavish adherence to tradition. Spivakovsky,
eulogised as the possessor of a tremendous
repertory, dished up ancient, hackneyed and
“safe” numbers, despite that he thereby in-
vited invidious comparisons with previous
importations. There is a genuine craving
in Australia for modern music—most concert
patrons are sick of the heavy German stuff
—but in the devastating prevalence of pro-
moters and performers who keep one eye
and the greater part of the other fixed on
the box-office it remains ungratified.
“M.R.” : The Australian stage is suffering
from a plague of reproducers—imported, of
course. Engaged because they have seen a
play in its original Yankee home, they try
to reproduce its atmosphere by insisting
that the Australian performer shall give a
slavish imitation of the reproducer’s imita-
tion of the original. The U.S. details are
also faithfully copied, and actors are copi-
ously imported, also because they have seen
the play. On paper, the result ought to be
brilliant, and yet shows which run one and
two years in New York scarcely run as many
weeks in Sydney and Melbourne. Numer-
ous examples could be quoted, if it were
worth the trouble. By very different methods
did J. C. Williamson lay the foundation of
his fortune and reputation. He understood
the Australian public and his failures were
few. He did not worry whether his pro-
ducer or artists had seer the play. He
relied on their intelligence and experience
and was seldom let in. But J.C.W. is dead’
and seemingly the J.C.W. tradition died
with him.
“T. 0.1.”: “Wart” errs (B. 18/5/’22) in
saying that G. V. Brooke and “Orion” Horne
were parties to the 1804 discussion of “Was
"OTHELLO,’ AT SYDNEY OPERA
HOUSE.
Allan Wilkie as the Moor.
Hamlet mad?” Brooke was then lying in the
bones of the London, in the Biscay Bay, and
Horne had gone back to England. The
correspondence (it originally appeared in
the Argus) was published in pamphlet form
by Henry Tolman Dwight, doyen of second-
hand booksellers in Australia. It arose out
of Walter Montgomery’s Hamlet, and was
started by James Smith, who was followed
by “Brown” (Dr. Neild), “Jones” (Charles
Bright) and “Robinson” (David Blair),
Archibald Micliie making a fifth. The date
of the pamphlet is 1867. Dwight was a lin-
guist and a very good authority on books.
He wrote pamphlets himself, notably “Aus-
tralian Celebrities,” 1865, and “Collected
Australian Works.” On his death his stock
of books (80,000 vols.) was sold by auction,
the sale extending over a week. His shop
was at the top of Bourke-street, adjoining
the Old White Haft Inn.
“Billy T.” : George Rignold was standing
at the back of the dress-circle in a Mel-
bourne theatre, watching a performance of
“Romeo and Juliet.” “Well, Mr. Rignold,
what do you think of Blank’s Romeo?” a
pressman asked. Handsome George thought
for a moment. “It has something to com-
mend it,” he said. “Like Tree’s Hamlet, it
is funny without being vulgar.” This reached
Blank’s ears, and he responded in kind,
speaking of a revival of “Henry V.”: “I
went to see the great actor; I only saw
mortal remains.” It was again George’s
turn. “I go to see Blank,” he said, “and
no mortal remains.”
“J.F.11.” (Lond.) : Pinero’s latest play.
“The Enchanted Cottage,” had a somewhat
frigid reception on its opening night at Lon-
don Duke of York’s, but has since been over-
hauled and tightened up. In its improved
condition it has good prospects of a favorable
run in London, with a subsequent career on
the American board. Australia, of course,
won’t see it —not for 10 years, anyhow.
“Fax”: I hope the youngest young ladies
in the Verbrugghen Orchestra didn’t join in
a threat to strike against the temporary in-
clusion of an experienced Melbourne ama-
teur in their organisation. Looking at some
of the slim and early professionals who play
second violins in the Verb. Orchestra one
reckons that the Musicians’ Union must be
regarded as a first-aid to matrimony, and
that the minor members of it are lucky to
be earning considerable wages on very easy
terms. Not but what other instrumentalists
than the Verb. Orchestra are spoilt children
of fortune these times. Musical times have
changed since the Duchess of Plaza Toro
first spoke bitterly of the band that insisted
on being paid for its services.
“C. Ockney”: Haddon Chambers’s widow
—Pepita Bobadilla is her striking stage-name
—was to take a part in her late husband’s
last play, “The Card Players,” down for
production at London Savoy in the latter
days of April. Godfrey Tearle, who seems
to have postponed his trip to these shores,
had the lead, and “Dot” Boucicault was to
put his old friend’s piece on the boards.
Boucicault continues to be one of the busiest
men in theatrical London. He only recently
revived “Mr. Pim Passes By,” at the Globe,
with Mrs. “Dot” (Irene Vanbrugh) in her
old part of Olivia and himself as the old
gent, of the title.

At a hrst glance it seems rather remark-
;<ble that whereas the number of entrants for the
\ .R.CJ. Grand National Steeplechase is 33 per cent,
higher than it was last year, the Hurdle entries are
only as many as before, and considerably fewer than
in 1920. But the proportion of dud entrants for
the Steeple is probably greater than for the easier
jumping race. A number of the new names among
the hurdlers can be taken more seriously than the
nominations of Nautical and The Rover last year.
The 70 ’chasers, however, include a lot that look
highly improbable starters for a National, though
they also include eight of the 13 who tackled the
big jumps last year. Old Doiran, the oft-placed
candidate from Adelaide, is there once more. This
year’s attempt, if it comes to pass, will be Doiran’s
fifth, but he doesn’t read like the most dangerous
opponent the Victorians will have to meet in July.

College Boy, a good-looking two-year-old
brother to the AVestralian crack Easingwold (Eaton
Lad —Bahloo), has been showing form in Melbourne.
Second in a youngsters’ race at Epsom to the speedy
and consistent Moccasin (Woorak —Miss Footbolt),
College Boy, who brought 900 guineas as a yearling,
improved on that performance by winning a Maiden
Plate at Moonee \ alley. He is a bit green yet,
but has plenty of pace. Apropos of Easingwold, the
V.R.C. handicapper has taken a risk by awarding,
him Bst. 111 b. in the City Handicap (Repique is
topweight with 9st. 101 b) and Bst. 51b. in the
Birthday Cup, the moderate Wildun being asked to
concede him 141 b. Fit and well on the day the big
chestnut would be hard to beat in either race, or
both. But he has had a hard season and may not
be at his best.
* * * *
Another attempt is to be made to intro-
duce the totalisator into the only State that still
bans it, while encouraging T. Rook. As soon as the
Vic. Assembly meets in July, Morley, M.L.A. for
Barwon, will give notice of his intention to intro-
duce a legalising bill. The measure he has drafted
is a simple thing, embodying merely the main prin-
ciple and machinery clauses to give effect to it.
Premier Lawson has promised ample time for dis-
cussion, and Ministers will be found voting on each
side when the division is taken. Opponents of the
bill won’t howl if they are beaten, as seems likelv
to be the case. Their support of the tax on bet-
ting tickets has left them without a shred of argu-
ment against the machine.

“Ver”: It was four days to the next meet-
ing at Broken Hill, and Paddy Wholagan, the bookie,
was feeling bored. Somebody in the bar aroused
his curiosity by telling of a day’s goat-racing at
the Blazing Stump Hotel. Out went Paddy, his
clerk, and a couple of others in a car. Arrived at
the course Patrick hailed a boy who looked as if he
knew something. “Which is the fastest goat here?”
asked Pat. “Stinker, on his own,” was the prompt
and confident reply. Pursuing his researches
Wholagan learned that “the bloke over there” was
Hie speedy quadruped’s owner and trainer. The
latter made no hones about accepting a fiver to
stiffen Stinker, so the note changed hands. Its
new possessor passed it to his mate, and. unknown
to Paddy, of course, told him to take the odds against
Stinker. The odds were 5 to 1, the odoriferous one
having receded in the market a bit, owing to
rumors, and Wholagan laid £25 to £5 against
Stinker, holding £9 12s. Gd. altogether. In the
spirit of a Roman father he watched the noble
animal add another triumph to his long list of turf
successes. On returning to Broken Hill the fielder
was talking to some friends about the day’s outing.
“Were there many goats there, Paddy,” asked one.
“No, only two,” said Wholagan, mournfully, but
gamely. “Stinker ’n’ me.”
* * * *
“Fra” : A friend of mine recently drew a
horse in one of Tatt.’s sweeps. Promptly he re-
ceived a demand from the owner for one-third of
first, second or third money to nothing, also £2OO
each for the trainer and jockey if his steed won.
I thought this form of bushranging had been blotted
out. Seemingly I was mistaken.
* * * *
“Bat”: At the far end of the grandstand
enclosure at Caulfield the seemingly eccentric con-
duct of a well-dressed young man caused some indig-
nation as well as bewilderment. After the horses
had flashed past the post and the numbers were up,
he looked searchingly around him and then suddenly,
without any remark, politely doffed the hats of the
half-dozen men nearest him. He w-as seemingly
just about to tackle another bunch when somebody
sternly caught his arm and asked with asperity
“What tl>e devil is the game?” And then it
came out. During the race, when hats cvere off and
necks were craned for a better view of the galloping
steeds, our friend had made a bet of £5 with a
baldheaded man. When roofs were re-tiled, he had
failed to recognise his debtor; hence his hasty and
unauthorised investigations. It was noticeable that
during the next race every person in the neighbor-
kept his hat on. .
* * * * *
“Tim Tiki”: A Dunedin (M.L.) man with
a turn for punting has put up a unique record,
although he had to die to do it. Being in Auck-
land a few months ago, he wagered £l5O on the
Otago yacht’s chances against Jellicoe’s Iron Duke
in the Sanders Cup races. He didn’t want to do
it, but his local friends badgered him into it.
The Otago boat beat the Auckland craft and Dunedin
collected. A life-insurance agent persuaded him
to invest his winnings in a policy for £SOCO. This
he did, paid one premium, and died, leaving his
family the £5OOO.

No one was more successful in ploughing
through the mud- at Sydney ’Varsity sports than
W. Hutton. Showing fine form he won the
100yds. in llsec., the 220 in 23 3-ssec., and the
440 in 52 4-ssec. L. W. Tunley’s mile in 4min.
41 4-ssec. was a good performance, considering that
the track was bad and that there was nobody fast
enough to make him hustle. O. E. Nothling won the
broad jump (21ft. (Win) and the shot putt (34ft.
91in.) ; and E. Zlotkowski (ex-Sydney Grammar
champion) took the high jump with sft. sin. N. S.

“Nitric” : Why do the people who control
amateur athletics allow youngsters to overdo it?
Consider F. S. Roberts’s record at Queensland Uni.
sports. He won two 100yds. sprints, one in 10
3-ssec., the other in 10 2-ssec. ; a 120yds. final in
an inter-collegiate relay race (time. 12 3-ssec.) ; the
220yds. in 23 2-ssec., and the 440yds. in 53 3-ssec.
lie also put the shot 31ft. and had a fly over the
hurdles. And all in one afternoon. Roberts ran
second to Gale, the Victorian champion, in the inter-
’Varsity 100yds. in Brisbane last year. He is a
mere youth, and is built* of championship material,
but will probably be a back number when he should
be in his prime.
Melbourne Uni. sports were contested with
unusual keenness this year. Newman led by a
narrow margin most of the afternoon, with the other
three colleges in a bunch close behind. In the
mile, the second last event, Ormond came to the
front with a brilliant first and second, and that
gave them a points victory over Newman, Queen’s
and Trinity. The star performer of the day was
Donovan (Newman), who won the three sprints
and lowered the 440yds. inter-collegiate record to
52 l-ssec. In the 880yds. McMillan (Ormond) won
by a yard from Ken Cohen (Trinity) and lowered
the half-mile record to 2min. 6 3-ssec. McMillan
also beat his team-mate Seekamp by inches in the
mile.
VINCE BLACK-
BURN, who scored
a sensational k.o.
victory over Jack
Green at Sydney
Stadium last
Saturday night.
England has taken the count, athletically
speaking, in a good many ways during the last
few years, but there’s a kick or "two left in her yet.
At Queen’s Club ground recently Mountain, Tatham,
Stallard and Seagrove, the Cambridge long-distance
runners, never gave the Pennsylvanians a look-in in
a four-mile relay race which 10,000 spectators saw.
It was feared that Mountain, who ran the first
mile, might “crack” at the finish, as he had never
gone beyond his pet distance —880yds.—before, but
the 19-year-old Cantab handed the baton on to
Tatham 25yds. ahead of the nearest American.
Tatham widened the gap to 30yds., and the horn-
spectacled Seagrove made it 45yds., leaving Larry
Brown, Pennsylvania’s captain, to face the impos-
sible in attempting to give Stallard such a big lead
over the final mile. Stallard romped in 125yds.
ahead, and the combined times (18min. 7 2-ssec.)
knocked 4-ssec off the English record.

Joe Kirkwood, the Australian champion,
has startled British golfers by making a cakewalk
of the big professional tournament at Lossiemouth.
On a green heavy with rain he went round in 69,
the performance of a master. After that it was
a procession, at the end of which Kirkwood (aggre-
gate, 290) was 13 strokes better than Holland and
Duncan, who tied for second money, with Seymour,
Boomer (Joe’s conqueror in the French champion-
ship), Ball, Mitchell and Vardon among- the beaten
division. The winner’s share of the offertory was
£l5O in currency and a trophy valued at £B5.
His Australian supporters have cabled him £5OO to
keep him going until the open championship at St.
Andrew’s, for which, with Jock Hutchison absent,
he is pretty sure to start favorite.

Harry Howde,n, one of the finest golfers
Australia has known, went out at Pennant Hills
(N.S.W.) last week. He was little' more than a youth
when he won his first amateur championship in 1896,
and he repeated the performance in 1897 and 1898
and again in 1901. After that he gradually drifted
away from the links owing to illness. His brother
Jim was also a champion. Tuberculosis killed them
both.

Saturday was a day of heavy scoring in.
the Melbourne League competition. The most im-
pressive exhibition was given by Essendon, who,
playing on their own ground against South Mel-
bourne and being 14 points behind at the third
bell, put on seven goals without a behind in the
last quarter, and won magnificently by 12.12 to
8.13. They are now the only unbeaten team. In
• a fine game at Victoria Park Collingwood gained
their first victory at Carlton’s expense-—lO.lB to
10.11 —and reinvigorated St. Kilda inflicted their

first licking on Mel-
bourne —12.12 to 11.8.
In the other match
Fitzroy kicked 14.13 to
Geelong's 10.12, Mer-
rick booting half the
winners’ goals. Unless
appearances are all
wrong, it is going to be
a most interesting sea-
son.
Sydney Sports Ground held 20,000 follow-
ers of ltugby League football when North Sydney
played Eastern Suburbs in the fourth round of the
premiership competition, and obliterated them by
18 points to 5. It was level pegging in the first
half, but after the interval North outclassed East’s
backs and forwards, putting on 13 points to nil.
It was a fine exhibition of the League game, and
there wasn’t a dull moment. For the winners,
Duncan Thompson was brilliant at half, but Wat-
kins, the East flier, didn’t give Holder many
chances; and Rigney, East’s custodian, made a
hack of Taplin. Clarrie Ives (North) was the
best forward on the grass, brother Bill (East)
being a close second. It was the 32nd East-North
match, and North’s sixth win. In the other
games, Balmain beat ’Varsity by 13 points to nil,
Newtown vanquished St. George (18 points to 10),
and Glebe proved too clever for West (23 points to
5). South Sydney now head the list with 7 points,
followed by North Sydney and Glebe, 6 points apiece,
and Balmain 5 points.

Two lots of Maori footballers will be play-
ing in Australia presently. A delegation from N.S.W.
Rugby League recently toured the Rickety Isles and
arranged for a team to play in N.S.W. and Queens-
land, and M.L. Rugby Union is also sending a side
over. Printed that the League secured its collection
by promising a share in a gate estimated (wildly) at
between £60.000 and £7p,000. It’s rather
ignoble tempting Maoris to abandon their ama-
teur status, but there is not much nobility in pro-
fessional football.
* * * •
“Hamer”: Rugby League football didn’t
get a start in the N. S. Wales public schools until
1919, but there are now 24 secondary and 89
primary schools playing the code. No primary
school is sticking to Union rules this year, although
55 of them adhered to it In 1920; ” but 29 high
schools are still faithful —11 fewer than in 1921.
But League hasn’t done all the damage. Soccer
is gaining converts, and there is a noticeable in-
crease in the popularity of tennis (played by 32
high schools) and baseball. The Australian foot-
ball game hasn’t got a footing with the older
pupils, and amongst the primary scholars it is
making no headway.

Cabled that Janie Luyt, the eldest of three
famous Springbok brothers, is being tried at Jo’burg
for high treason, arising out of the recent rebellion.
Janie was one of the star forwards- of the 1912
Springboks, but could play anywhere, while the two
brothers were brilliant backs. Luyt was over here
last year accompanying the S. African Rugger team. A
Free-stater, he was naturally a Hertzogite, and this
probably accounts for the mess he has got into, for
it is pretty plain that the Hertzog Nationalists were
ready to back the Jo’burg Reds, if things went well.
Australia’s prospects of reaching the
challenge round for the Davis Cup are alleged to be
brightened by the expected absence of Kumagae from
the Japanese team. Kumagae, long considered to be
Nippon’s best player, didn’t do so well as his
partner Shimidzu against Anderson and Hawkes in
the U.S. last year; in fact, he was nearly beaten by
both. His absence should not be greatly felt,
inasmuch as there is another promising man, Kashio,
ready to take his place. Kashio is considered to
be of lower grade than Kumagae, but he has been
appearing in first-class tennis in Uncle Harding’s
country for some time, and has the reputation of
being a tricky and resourceful player. Shimidzu’s
powers are, of course, well known. Ever glued to
the back line in his matches and playing with an
awkward backhand grip, he has won numerous prizes
in India, Britain and America. In his last appear-
ance at Wimbledon he ran into the semi-finals for
the world’s singles championship.

G. N. Roberts and C. S. Buckley won the
open doubles at the Grace Park (Vic.) tennis tourna-
ment the other day. This is their third successive
victory, and entitles them to keep the decorative
shield presented for the event by T. W. Woodard, a
noted patron of the Grace Park Club. Roberts and
Buckley have been appearing together since 1908,
and they should prove formidable in the pennant
competitions this season, seeing that Melbourne are
without their best pair, Patterson and 'Wertheim,
whilst South Yarra’s absentees are Brookes and O’Hara
Wood. The only international in Victoria at
present is Ilawkes, and he should be the mainstay of
Geelong.

“Ex-Englishman”: That fine crew from
Murray Bridge (S.A.) wants to go to Henley to
meet the pick of England, but hasn’t a hope. It
cabled the status of the men from whom it proposed
to select its eight—four locomotive firemen, three
engine-drivers, two fitters and a carpenter; also a
steamer captain and a postal clerk. The last-named
is about the only one who could pass muster. The
captain would be debarred as being. engaged on a
boat, and the rest as manual laborers. The rule is
as snobbish as you please, but there it is. The
ancient Peruvians weren’t more exclusive or con-
servative than the British directors of amateur row-
ing’ .
“T.R.H.”: Re “money in football” (B.
4/5/’22). If 85s. a week and a “cut” of the profits
is the best Australia can do for a star tour such
as the Kangaroos’ visit to the Old Dart, there is
not so much spondulix in football as I should have
thought. When I was quite a youth, my native
town Bury (Lancashire) won the English Cup
(Soccer) three years running. Like all first-division
teams the members were all professionals—mostly
imported Scotsmen. Even at that time —when a
quid really was a quid—the players’ screw was from
£4 to £6 a week, winter and summer; also pick-
ings in the way of “benefits.” They, however, had
to give up their whole time to the “business,” and
their high-salaried trainer kept them as highly
trained as boxers are kept in Australia. It was
the same with every first- and second-division team.
Even then the profits were enormous, the usual
Saturday-afternoon attendance at all League matches
being from 2(1,000 to 50,000. The annual final for
“Th’ English Coop” at the Crystal Palace attracted
scores of thousands from Lancashire and the North.

“Trim.” : After 30 years’ service with the
South Melbourne F. C., Bert Howson has passed an
the secretarial duties to L. H. Mcßrien. For 13
years he was supreme among wing-men, and when he
laid aside the jersey it was to become secretary.
As a cricketer Howson has a first-class record; and,
altogether, he leaves a reputation for all-round
ability and honesty that will be hard to excel.
South Melbourne has another all-rounder in cricket-
secretary Harry Brereton, who, in his day, was the
best half-forward playing the Australian game of
football. This year Harry would have won the
pennant team’s batting honors had not Woodfull
brought in an average of 156.5.
* * * *
Though still only a boy in years, Jacky
Green is not the boxer he used to be. This Vince
Blackburn demonstrated at Sydney Stadium by
knocking him out in 13 rounds. Blackburn, wjjose
recent form had been poor, was the outsider in the
betting, and was apparently getting the worse of a
moderately skilful argument when a speculative
right broke through Green’s guard and landed on the
point. A couple more of the same description
and sleep slid into Jaeky’s soul. The astonished
victor hit the breeze for the Stadium office to
collect the thick end of the purse.
Jainito and Jerry Sullivan gave another of
their gentlemanly 20-round exhibitions arf; Melb,
Stadium on Saturday night. Jammy, who was
41b heavier than the paleface, was the more aggres-
sive of the pair, and displayed the greater skill in
placing his punches—neither can knock a man out
unless his adversary has a glass jaw—but. when the
cease fire sounded, with Sully still on his feet, the
referee said “I can’t separate ’em, gentlemen.”
Most of the howling that ensued come from Sulli-
van’s supporters. It is the way of' boxing crowds.

Jim Tracy, the Australian heavyweight,
was knocked out in New York last week by Irish
Bill Brennan (he is a native of County Mayo), who
went 12 rounds with Dempsey. Tracy had lasted
eight rounds when the king hit came over, but
always looked a loser after the third. He showed
a flash of form in Australia when he got a decision
over the American Tom McMahon, who beat Jess
Willard in 12 rounds on March 27, 1917, but was
slugged out in a few rounds by Tom O’Malley.
Thereupon the long bin’s liking for the game
evaporated. #
From an old Australian pressman ;
I went out to Holland Park Skating Rink to see
Cook fight Beckett. It was a dreary scuffle, with
hardly a decent punch in it from start to finish, and
a thoroughly bored audience displayed no resent-
ment when referee Douglas (a younger brother oi
J.W.H.T.) brought the tiling to an end by disqualify-
ing Cook for holding. As a matter of fact, Beckett
was just as bad as Cook in this respect. Isn’t it
time that something was done about the calm appro-
priation by various duds of Australian cham-
pionship titles? I am a bit out of touch with
Australian boxing form these days, but if Cook
is really champion of Australia, I •' am sorry for the
others. ' He has a clever manager in Lucas, but how
that astute gentleman ever managed to get his
protege a match with Carpentier is beyond me!
Heavyweight form over here is a joke. Next to
Cook,' Beckett is the most depressing proposition I
have ever seen in a ring. Yet, although Carpentier
gave him a frightful hiding and put him to sleep
in less than a minute, there is already talk of a
return match with the Frenchman. No one is in
a more fortunate position than this young gentle-
man. The crop of lemons he has had to select
from show's no sign of exhaustion.

The cycle-track round Adelaide Oval dis-
appears at last. Laid down about 25 years ago. it
just about paid for itself before cycle-racing died.
With its long straights and heavily-banked turns, it
was a model of its kind, but of late years it has
been of no use except as returning a boundary hit
at cricket to the hands of the nearest fielder. Now
it comes up, to enable the mounds to be extended and
terraced.

Tom Wilson, of Ivaitangata, one of the
finest deer-stalkers in Maoriland, got the head of
the season in Tapanui the other day, w'hen he
brought dowm a beautiful stag which had dodged
rifles for the past half-dozen years. It was a 26-
pointer, with a spread of 34in. —the finest head
ever secured in the district. Deer-shooting has been
uncommonly good in M.L. this year.
THE VICTIM.

Let us consider, brother mugs,
With pity for his hard condition,
That patron of soubrettes and pugs
A stern constabulary slugs—
Meßook, the metallician.
With manly fortitude he bears
A cross that’s chiefly knocks and bruises.
Upon his solemn oath lie swears
(The horse-reporter, too, declares)
lie nearly always loses.
When five outsiders homeward roil
At odds from fifties to elevens,
The scribes entreat you to console
With Rook, because The Flying Bowl
Annexed “the last” at sevens.
But after Randwick, ’tis averred—
Green Randwick, where he stalks his lizard—
in swell hotels his voice is heard,
And Heidsieck washes down the bird
Reposing in his gizzard.
Royal, according to the cats
(Falsely, perhaps), arc these carouses.
But get this underneath your hats,
My fellow-punters, boobs and flats—
We can’t buy picture-houses.

Lady Grey-Egerton is arriving in Mel-
bourne shortly on a visit to her brother. She
was beautiful Airn&e Gumming when she
married Rupert Clarke 30-odd years ago.
Shortly after the divorce she married the
Grey-Egerton baronet, who had himself been
divorced by the American heiress he had
espoused a few years previously. His only
daughter has a sort of connection with Aus-
tralia: she married Major Prideaux-Brune,
a near relative of the young man who mar-
ried one of the Garvan girls, of Sydney. Both
the Grey-Egerton boys were killed in the
war, and the present heir-presumptive to
the title is a distant cousin.
The Jack Joshua pair are off in the Ormuz
to catch the English summer, and inciden-
tally to meet their elder daughter, June, who
left last month. On Tuesday afternoon Mrs.
Jack, in dark blue and Oriental embroideries
topped by a black lace-draped head-piece,
said good-bye to her friends in the Alexan-
dra Club parlors to the pleasing accompani-
ment of a violin and piano which, by request,
played with the soft pedal down. She was
toasted in brimming goblets of tea, and
wished God-speed and a safe return with the
feminine equivalent of musical honors and
no heel-taps. It was a great occasion.
Betty Paterson announces her engage-
ment to Kenneth Newman, and corroborates
the statement with a blinding exhibition on
the third finger of her left hand. The in-
tended, who is related to the Melbourne
jewellery firm of Newman’s, is an unassum-
ing young man who makes friends with his
smile, which is still pleasant, notwithstand-
ing that at the war he was captured by the
Huns and fed on black bread and turnips
for two years in various prisons.
The Mrs. McGaw who died at Manly
Beach (N.S.W.) last week was a Melbourne
woman in a sense. Thirty years ago her
station-owning husband was a prominent
figure of the Collins-street Block, which he
paraded daily dressed in - the height of
fashion, as it was then understood. A son,
Jack McGaw, made something of a punch
in the early days of Kalgoorlie. Later Mrs.
McGaw became fascinated by “Dailey’s
Castle” at Manly (the big stone place built
after the style of a Norman "keep,” wiiich
dominates the western side of the famous
watering-place), and bought it for a song—
under £5OOO. She lived there till the day of
her death.
Melba’s protegee, Dorothy Murdoch, the
lively ginger-haired maiden with the con-
tralto voice, was one of the arrivals on the
Moreton Bay. Her farewell concert in Eng-
land was with the Liverpool Philharmonic.
She had some temptations to go in for
grand opera, but resisted them in favor of
the concert platform.
Lady Stradbroke, muffled to the chin in
furs and with a droopy hat that hid every-
thing but her smile, gave a tea-party to the
wives and mothers of Diggers at the Masonic
Hall a few days ago. Her Ex. said she
would have liked to invite them to Stoning-
ton, but the weather was too cold for a
garden fSte. There is not much room in-
doors at Stonington. Vice-president Mrs.
Victor Sellheim gave everybody a message
from the first president of the Friendly
Union, Lady Novar —Lady Helen Ferguson
as was. It was full of warm greetings and
remembrances.
Lady Helena Rous has just returned after
sampling the winter climate of Bananaland.
She stayed at Brisbane Government House,
and put in a fortnight on Coochin Coochin
station.
Mrs. Arthur Robb, Teddy Downes’s youth-
ful looking mother-in-law, covered herself
with glory the other day by grabbing a young
burglar man as he was making off with her
purse and jewels. The story goes that
she shook him until his teeth rattled
in his head and his ill-gotten gains in
his trousers pocket. Nevertheless, he cast
her off, skipped through a window and fled.
The lady hollered “Stop, thief!” The trusty
driver of a furniture-van heard the cry, took
up the chase, and anon returned with the
stolen goods tucked under his honest arm.
The picture rights of the incident have not
yet been disposed of.
The Arts and Crafts, presided over by
Trantham Prior, is preparing a small open
show, to run 11 days from July 11, in the
Collins-street Queen’s Hall. The society has
lately enlarged its council to befit its present
importance. Miss Adelaide Allan now sits on
the treasury chest, while Mr. T J. Maloney
flourishes the secretarial pen. Mrs. Oswald
S.vme and Dr. Courtney are vice-presidents,
and Frank Walker, Miss N. Bagot and E.
Alsop help to decorate the committee.
At a sharp curve on the Sassafras (Vic.)
road —a popular pleasure run not far from
the city—a car plunged over the edge. There
was a drop of 100 ft., but the auto hung
itself on a tree after it had dived 15ft. This
happened two weeks ago, and one of our
most careful girl chauffeurs was at the wheel.
Five other cars have gone over at this very
spot, and it looks as if the Roads Board
or somebody is waiting for the thirteenth
accident before they discover how unlucky
the corner can be.
Ella Guthrie and Mrs. Colin Frazer are
whipping up a series of select card-parties
for June with the idea of helping the
Prahran, Toorak and S. Yarra Creche, whose
funds are at a low ebb.
Winifred Walter Butler is wearing a dia-
mond engagement-ring, recently presented to
her by Colin, son of the Henry Harpers.
Mrs. Glencross —prominent in the protest
of housewives against H.C.L. —became so
upset at being caricatured in a Melbourne
evening paper that she resigned her job as
leader of the association. The other house-
wives are imploring her to reconsider the
matter. The incident sheds a queer light on
the self-consciousness of some good women.
And they are talking of becoming active
politicians!
The Graham Falkiners gave a little
coming-out dance for their daughter Jennie
at Whare, Toorak, the other night. The
maiden wore a wonderful frock that flared
Frenehily in misty blue and pink from a
corselet of mother-of-pearl coins calculated
to make a South Sea belle wild with
envy. Her mother affected a gleaming jet
and tulle gown and saw that everything went
well in the flower-smothered house. Queenie
Winter Irving’s grey tulle frock was held
together by satin flowers; Bee Bayles was a
nut-brown maid of expensive simplicity;
Miss Graham wore a yard or so of sapphire-
blue velvet, and Gladys Brunton’s oleander-
pink frock was a huge success, as was the
Morton girl’s orchid-colored georgette. Mahdi
Syme wore black net patterned in silver
stars, and Vi Hiskens had a fairy-tale frock
of grey with silver roses, while one of the
Sutherland girls fluffed in pleated moonlight-
blue tulle.
The Franklin-Langdon wedding, if quiet,
was an intensely frocky affair. The bride-
groom’s clothes were awfully nice, but
usual. Bridegrooms are like that. It is
doubtful if many even go so far as to wear
blue suspenders for luck. But bride Mar-
jory’s frock was a marvel. Pink crepe de
thine was covered with gold-embroidered
georgette of a paler pink, then covered again
with a layer of ivory georgette, and the
whole was hitched together with gold leaves.
A gold tissue hat and a garland of pale-
tinted flowers topped the lot. Even the
bouquet had gold ribbon streamers. Cousin
Innis Gould carried the paraphernalia and
was brave in white chiffon and a big blue
sash ; and a three-year-old niece of the bride-
groom had a place in the pageant all fluffed
in white and blue. Mamma Langdon had
a black gown glittering with steel bead em-
broidery and a rich cloak of black and silver
and fur. The bride achieved another frocky
effect before motoring away—a whole outfit
of grey with some pressed pansies round her
hat. The bridegroom is Instructor-Lieut.-
Commander Franklin, of Jervis Bay naval
station, and Chaplin Birch came down from
there to give the Rev. A. Law a hand in
tying the important knot at St. John’s,
Toorak.
The* knightly Ilennessy did the honors as
council president when our Earl dropped
into the Workingmen’s College the other
night. The place has expanded greatly since
the days of Francis Ormond, the founder,
and the council has its eye on the M'elb. Gaol
site now that the Government has made up
its mind to shift the prisoners to Pentridge.
Stradbroke spent two hours going through,
and later, noting how Tories, Liberals' of
various grqdes and Laborites of the moder-
ate and whole-hogger type were working to-
gether amicably, he got off a diplomatic com-
ment on the \yisdom of pulling together for
the general good.
Somebody triumphantly asserts that long
skirts are “in” again because they were worn
at Ascot. “Tosh !” says the Australian girl.
Everybody knows that the fashions at Ascot
have to pass Court censorship—skirts so
many inches from the toes, gowns cut just
so many inches from the chin, dresses just
so many inches wide or narrow, as the royal
fashion decrees. Incidentally, the men are
more slavishly bound- than the women. For
Ascot the tie must be just so, the pepper-
and-salt or check or stripe of the pants
must conform to a meticulous rule, the coat
lapel has to be of a special cut, and the
number of buttons on the cuff is a matter
of life and death. One year when Ascot
happened during Court mourning the
fashionable English papers made good read-
ing. They went into exhaustive details of
what had to be worn, clearly implying that
anyone who was mad enough to defy the
rules of a Nation’s Grief would be shot out
of the enclosure, whether he had a Lord
Chamberlain’s signed permit to be there or
not.
What was said a year ago about the absur-
dity of a Gaud Mayoral reception to the
fiddling Heifetz and his Atnerican-Jew pian-
ist friend sounds truer than ever this season.
Spivakovsky and Toscha Seidel were an-
nounced in Melbourne by an even louder
flourish of Tait trumpet, but the idea of a
civic gathering in honor of two more tra-
velling instrumentalists was out of the ques-
tion. So the new-comers missed the glori-
fication, and have been not nearly such good
“draws” as their young predecessors. There
was too much fever-heat in the civic wor-
ship of those artistic Jew-boys last year.
It couldn’t possibly be repeated within 12
months.
No place is sacred now. The other day,
haying no where else to take them, Peacock,
Minister of Labor, packed the Executive
Council Chamber —the holy of holies that
used to be strictly reserved for Vice-royalty
up to the time of Fuller —with a deputation
of greengrocers, who were protesting against
any concession to Dagoes and other fruit-
sellers in the heart of the city in respect to
7 o’clock closing in winter. There was a
deputation of fruitgrowers on the other side
afterwards, so the place will reek with the
flavor of apples, turnips and cabbages, not
to mention garlic and spaghetti, for days.
And how can dignity flourish in that kind of
atmosphere?
J. W. Bilson, M.L.A., obtained his politi-
cal majority recently, having been, a Labor
member for an unbroken 21 years. A party
of old campaigners and present members
marked the event with speeches and presen-
tations.
This is Monteath’s opinion of Waldemar
Seidel, the original tutor of Doreen Clarke,
who recently won the Clarke Scholarship at
the Royal College of Music, London. Wal-
demar (an Australian native, despite his
name) is a prolific
producer of star per-
formers at London
and Australian musi-
cal exams, and his stu-
dents have captured
the gold medal for
the piano five years
in succession at the
Trinity College of
Music (Lond.). In
addition, he is a con-
cert soloist of some
circumstance. A
couple of months
back he returned
from an Australian
tour with Amy
Castles, in the course
of which he found
that tlie transposing
of music to suit Outback instruments was
one of his duties. In Brisbane Amy mislaid
her music, and Seidel had to rely on his
memory for the accompaniments. He went
through three programmes, including several
arias, without missing a note.
At a recent departmental conference one
member got on everyone’s nerves by trying
to monopolise the talk. He was sitting oppo-
site the presiding official, who happened to
be a young officer with a fine disregard for
staid procedure and departmental standards
of conduct. After the obnoxious one had
been tolerated for over an hour the presi-
dent was seen to be fumbling under the
table, then while the bore was intoning tire-
some extracts from a legal compilation, he
suddenly found himself thumped on the head
and showered with dust, cigarette ends and
dead matches. The president had belted him
with the mat.
Carl Nobelius, creator of the picturesque
nurseries which are the glory of Emerald,
on the Gembrook narrow-gauge line, and who
had some similar possessions in the Speck,
left £21,297 to his widow and family, subject
to bequests to a couple of old employees.
Lieutenant P. F. Chirnside, of the Bth
Hussars, is on his way home by the Malwa
to spend six months in Yic. with his father,
formerly of The Manor, Werribee, and now
of Wheeler’s Hill. The Chirnsides have
always been strong on military matters. For
years they paid for the upkeep of a half-
battery of artillery, and in 1897 Captain
Percy, then an M.L.A., provided the whole
cost of a military encampment because the
Turner Government, as an economical expe-
dient, proposed to give it the go-by that year.
Toscha Seidel’s welcome at the Town Hall
on Saturday should be specially mentioned
in his diary if he keeps one. From the
first item hands, feet and old gentlemen’s
walking-sticks were responsible for a clamor
that doubled up the youth in innumerable
salaams. Unlike his compatriot Heifetz,
whose boiler-plated decorum nothing could
ruffle, young Seidel cradles himself to his
own music, with his eyes tightly closed and
his lips curiously clamped together as if re-
sisting the exit of an awful secret. During
passionate passages his breath comes in
audible gusts through his nose, and the per-
spiring head sinks further into his sodden
collar. Tailors will notice that his wh.t ■
vest is decorated with amber buttons, whilst
jet ones twinkle on his evening coat. With
his ungovernable hair and heavy foreign
features, he affords a strong contrast to hi?
mild, pince-nezed accompanist, Frank Hut-
chens, who looks like a descendant of several
generations of curates.
The unsavory Eastern Arcade has now-
become of curious interest to the Taxation
authorities. The exposures in the Ross cas*
about those people who hold "message meet-
ings” there; and the connection of these
charlatans with some of the Crown witnesses
of doubtful character has caused a falling
off in attendances. Previous to the ex-
posure ‘‘House Full” notices were daily dis-
played outside the rooms of these “bob’s
worth of future” artists, and the Govern-
ment raked in much money by way of amuse-
ment taxes. Now that one of the high-
priestesses has put up the shutters and the
others are having a desperate struggle to pay
the rent, the tax-gatherers have become so
concerned that an officer has been detailed
to inquire into the diminishing returns.
The Stork —or was it the emu? —has just
been round to the Westralian home of novel-
ist Katherine Prichard and her Gallipoli
hero, Hugo Throssell, and has left them a
boy. The infant will have two exceptional
reasons in the clever Kathie and her Y.C.
husband for feeling grateful to the bird that
brought him.
Preparations are well in hand for the
week’s celebration of the jubilee of Trinity
College, at the ’Varsity, beginning on June
9. Bishop Green, first student of the col-
lege to climb to episcopal rank, will be the
sermoniser at St. Paul’s on June 11. Some
of the most brilliant of the graduates of
Trin. were among the active or passive par-
ticipants in the revolt of students in 1890—
but that episode has been almost forgotten.
Digger Russell Clarke, M.L.C. (who,
the way, has not persevered with his candi-
dature for the Senate! has offered £lOOO for
the extension of the hall erected in memory
of his mother if the committee can induce
others to ante-up £4OOO.
Everard Browne has re-crossed the thres-
hold of the nursing home where he Ims
spent many weary months. He is now top-
ping off his convalescence at Portsea with
his wife. Later they will go back to their
Fail-lie House flat.
Adelaide drops a line or two: —
From England comes news of Merle Robertson, a
Conservatorium student who won the Elder Scholar-
ship in ’l5, and has been at the other side of the
world ever since. Latterly she has been studying
and giving concerts in Denmark and Germany, and
after playing a concerted number with a Copen-
hagen orchestra, that city’s critics hailed her as a
“young lady with talent and great technique, and a
delightful and musical interpretation.” She is
booked for a London concert at the end of this
month.
One of the most delectable houses at Mount Lofty
has changed hands—the Arthur Waterhouses’ home
near the summit. The George Cowans are the
lucky purchasers. By the way, the engagement is
announced of Tim, the Waterhouses’ only son, to
Molly, daughter of the Fred Joyners.
One useful branch of the Victoria League sends
regular parcels of books and papers to settlers out
back, and especially to the English wives of Aus-
tralian soldiers with whom it has come into touch
through its Settlers’ Welcome committee. A con-
cert by Mrs. Ernest Scott and Nora Kyffin Thomas
the other night brought in a host of contributions in
cash and kind that will enable the work to be car-
ried on with ample supplies for some time. A day
or two previously Mrs. Scott lectured for the League
on “Humor in Music,” and for that, too, she drew
a bumper house.
The Darling Building at the ’Varsity, which
houses the new laboratories for the medical school,
and is a memorial to the late John Darling, having
been paid for by a donation of £15,000 from his
family—was officially prised open last week. Wisely
the invitation list had been cut low enough to
leave breathing space, but there was a big muster,
including Lieutenant-Governor Murray and his sister,
Grace Darling, the George Brookmans and Douglas
Mawsons, the Joseph Vercos, Walter Bagots and
innumerable professors and doctors and their wives.
A joint vocal and pianoforte recital by Katie
Joyce and Ethel Bonavia drew to the Town Hall
an audience which .waxed enthusiastic over the
way Katie had developed her voice and her art in
London and Paris. Her hearers were particularly
struck with an unexpected lower register, of which
there was little sign before she went abroad.
An enterprising damsel who sought to add to the
list of women’s industries by joining the unauthor-
ised ranks of “bookies” at Morphettville got scant
encouragement from the police. They saw her
making bets, clinched matters by making one or
two with her themselves, then hauled her off to an
unsympathetic police-court that fined her £7.
The estate of the late Walter Duffield, sworn at
£50,000, goes mostly to his widow —one of the
Kirkpatrick clan —and two sons.
Archibald Strong’s enthusiasm has given a flick
to public interest in Repertory Theatre work,
and there was a crowded house for Shaw’s
“Pygmalion,” the first performance of the ’22 ses-
sion. The evening’s honors went to Wilfred Neill
as Henry Higgins, and Ivy Stacey as Liza Doolittle;
but Basil Harford (Colonel Pickering) and Ethel-
wyn Robin (Mrs. Pearce) ran them close.

of the tremendous
enthusiasm shown
by owners of the
GULBRANSEN
*
Player Piano.
The amazing difference between the Pedal
Touch of the Duo Concerto and other players
cannot be fully realised until you have
actually played this master instrument
YOURSELF.
Its pedalling is so easy,
Its manipulation so simple,
Its tone so perfect, and,
combined with Wonderful Durability of Piano
Construction, places this instrument on a
plane alone.
Mr. Gulbransen, owing to the world-wide
demand for the Duo-Concerto, could not find
floor space in his factory to manufacture
straight out pianos—but now, having erected
the largest piano-factory in the world, is send-
ing us regular shipments of these pianos. The
first shipment having arrived you would do
well to inspect at once, by reason of the fact
that they are selling so fast.
These pianos, like the Duo-Concerto Player-
piano, carry Gulbransen’s famous guarantee
—and are nationally priced.

No amount of swish in accent and frock-
ing could prevent the St. Luke’s flutter from
looking first cousin to a barn-dance. The
Calais de Danse at Moore Park, which
housed it, was prickled all over the outside
with electrics; while inside it was hectic
with miles of colored-paper decorations. It
is one of the Showground buildings, and has
an enormous Hoorage that extends from the
North to the South Pole —or so it seemed
to the bridge-players condemned to the little
tables outside the barricaded dancing area.
Along a-wall that cut dancers and supper
in half till 10 o’clock were little pens which
may in sterner days be used to restrain sav-
age rabbits.
About fourteen hundred dancers writhed
and kicked up their heels on the polished
boards, and the purple and mauve of the
Anderson Stuart lady did not fail to put in
an appearance. Mrs. Tony Hordern mingled
old rose satin and black georgette draperies,
and Mrs. Roystone Davey, who had done the
secretarial engineering with Frank Lamb,
was businesslike in black satin and jet.
Black clothed the handsome Itolin lady and
sister Mrs. Rich, and Joan Rolin was a
study in jade green. Audrey Schute, Helen
Laidley and Sunbeam Mylius were stars in
the younger firmament; and Mrs. A. E.
Hughes changed color like a chameleon
according as the light glittered on her irides-
cent sequins. Gwen Marks wore her hair
licked back in the satin-smooth fashion that
goes only with the best features; and Miss
Nathan might have been hung in an art-
show labelled “A Grey Day.” The knightly
Rickardses brought a black-haired, primrose-
clad daughter. Mrs. Harry Carr and daugh-
ter Phyllis had large helpings of brown lace
and black sequins. Mrs. Richard Meares
was expensively entangled in satin and lace;
yellow satin that carried black hieroglyphics
enwrapped the hospital’s matron; and the
Wade lady’s satin was as a mauve anemone.
The Vice-regals arrived in separate batches,
so that neither of the King’s representatives
had his entrance blurred by the other. The
G.-G.’s lady was sleek in black chiffon vel-
vet, and had her hair sown with diamonds.
Dame Margaret trailed white brocade, and
sported the usual diamond ensigns; and the
little Digby lady was like a bon-bon de luxe
in tulle and gold tissue.
Last week’s cabled news that a receiving
order in bankruptcy had been granted
against Barbara Baynton’s new husband,
Lord Headley, did not astonish those who
had met the amiable old gentleman. He is
one of those well-meaning souls who drift
into things. He drifted into Mohammedan-
ism and then out of it; into various callings,
for all of which he showed great aptitude
till he got bored and drifted out; then into
matrimony ; and now into bankruptcy. The
last is the sort of thing that may befall any-
one in England, considering the present-day
level of prices, and the next news Lord Head-
ley’s friends expect to hear is that he has
reached the crest of a fresh wave and drifted
smilingly back to solvency.
The Alex. Hays are not only selling 157
Macquarie-Street, which has been one of Syd-
ney’s social centres for three-quarters of a
century, but all the lovely things in it.
Some of the china —and notably the Spode—
is priceless. The family intends to move
to England for a time. There is a small boy
who will eventually go to a public school
there.
They were two rich, but not bigotediy
cultured, Edgecliffites, and they had just re-
turned from their first trip to Europe. Some
friends gave a dinner party in honor of the
event, and the talk fell upon the wonders
they had seen. “Of course,” gushed one
admirer, “you saw the lions of St. Marks’s?”
“I did,” replied the lady traveller, “and
to tell you the truth, my dear, Gus and
I decided that there’s no zoo on the Conti-
nent that’s a patch on Taronga.” Meantime
the husband at the other end of the table
was being asked for his views of the. Cata-
combs. “Over-rated,” lie said. “Now, what
would those Dagoes say if they had the
Jenolan Caves?” —and a wave of his fork in-
dicated stupefaction better than any words.
In N. S. Wales a clever child can buy its
own University training with its brains. The
history of Doris Coutts, who goes to Eng-
land in July to complete her education,
should be illuminated and framed as a
dazzling illustration of how it may be done.
She went from the Sydney High to the ’Var-
sity, having won an exhibition and the
Teachers’ College scholarship. Her five
years’ course was one succession of medals,
honors and scholarships; and now she has
scored the travelling scholarship which takes
her to England. In her leisure moments she
has studied the violin at the Con.
John Longstaff is doing a portrait of
Melba at Government House. He works
there o’ nights under the full glare of the
electrics. Does anybody know if it’s a pre-
sentation picture or a purchase by the Dame
out of her own pocket money ?
This fully-employed artist, by the way, has
just done a much-admired portrait of Dr.
George Paul, who was killed in a motor
accident some months ago, on his way to
a dance at the Onslows’ place, near Camden.
The commission was given by John Paul, the
octogenarian father of the unlucky young
man.
Mrs. Jack Toohey, who came out on the
Omar with the Sistine Choir, has been enter-
taining them busily ; but, then, everybody of
note in R.C. circles has been doing that. It
has been one long struggle to give the artists
dyspepsia, in a manner of speaking. Mrs.
Toohey's sister, Mrs. Weston, will lit the
next member of the family to flee the coun-
try: she leaves for England via America
next month.
Although Annie Be.sant literally brought
the Beans with her in her limousine the other
day, when she was lunched by the Institute
of Everybody but Journalists, still there was
a vegetarian brew or two on the food list.
After she had eaten one or two lentils and a
nut she got to her feet and made a stirring
appeal for Home Rule for India. Apparently
she quite carried away her highly respectable
audience, despite the fact of Empire Day
being .so near. But she threw one sop to
the S. M. Herald Cerberus, who was watch-
ing her narrowly through his spectacles. She
repudiated Gandhi and all his works, and was
tactful enough in this under-populated and
over-clericalised country to refrain from
airing her views on Malthusianism.
Jack Lindsay, Norman’s eldest son, has
been promised a life monopoly over the soft
glances of Janet Beaton’s lapis lazuli blue
eyes. He was an interpreter (in Russian)
during the war, and had a brilliant career at
Brisbane University; and both have contri-
buted to various Sydney and Melbourne
periodicals—in fact, the Art in Australia
people are shortly bringing out a volume of
his poems. She is the only daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Lachlan Beaton.
Big contingents from Rose Bay and Vau-
cluse turned up at Sargent’s the other night
to dance away some of the wad of debt that
sits on the chest of the new parish church
of St. Mary Magdalene. Mrs. Cecil Manion,
Mrs. Gibbs and Miss Grimes, the secretaries,
were there, and a smiling Lane Mullins girl,
who held the treasury bag. The Hughes
knight arrived late with his handsomely-
frocked lady, together with Mrs. Roger
Hughes in a black and white contrast car-
ried out in satin and lace, and Mrs. Harry
Hughes. The newly-hatched M.L.A., Dr.
Fallon, brought his young wife; and for the
rest there was a profusion of flappers and
enthusiastic partners.
This is the latest
London photograph
of knightess Ander-
son-Stuart, whose
late husband fo r
many years held the
Chair of Physi-
ology and Anatomy
at Sydney Uni. The
lady has established
a syncopated claim
to .fame on her own
account: she won
several jazz compe-
titions in London’s
d ancing centres.
Last week her ex-
hibition of how to
do the latest steps
was the feature of
St. Luke’s Ball.
The Naval Comrades of N. S. Wales have
just heard from the Lady-in-Waiting to
Princess Mary that she has been deeply
touched by their expressions of pleasure at
the news of her wedding. In reply the
Naval Comrades wish, through The Bulle-
tin, to collectively pull a loyal forelock in
the traditional sea-going style, and say they
are deeply touched to hear it.
Elsa Stralia has been offered the first con-
tract (naming her own terms, practically)
in an opera co. just organised by a crowd
of Chicago (U.S.) millionaires, which will
render the works of the operatic masters in
English. At the time of writing she is brood-
ing over the proposition in that great city
where the screams of the dying pig from the
Meat Trusts’ works compete night and day
with the swishing sound of Hebrew hands
rending the air in converse.
Pianist Lee Pattison, who invades Sydney
with Guy Maier next month, did his bit in
)he war as a regimental bandmaster. While
in Paris looking for music or band instru-
ments or something he stopped his issue of
matrimonial bliss. In a Y.M.C.A. can-
teen he noticed a waitress sloshing out
coffee from a pot in her right hand what
time she cascaded cocoa from a like utensil
held in her left. He at once recognised a
soul-mate in this lass, who to exceptional
loveliness added the merit of ambidexterity.
Gladys Cousins was her name, and they are
now man and wife.
The Hon. Percy Thellusson is to be mar-
ried shortly to the Hon. Mrs. Yorke, a well-
to-do young woman who divorced the heir
to the llardwicke earldom four years ago.
Mr. Thellusson was in Australia shortly be-
fore the war as what the Yanks call a
"drummer” for a well-known brand of chain -
pagne—hence the nickname which he an-
swered to readily of “Champagne Charlie.”
Mrs. T. H. Kelly, in the book which she
wrote about her travels in India—-a volume,
the memory of which still makes dyspeptic
officials and self-conscious A.D.C.’s who
were there when she passed by flush deeply
—told some diverting stories about the
champagne vendor’s methods in the East.
He was a great pigeon-slayer in his day,
and when the practice became so unpopular
that the Queen said she would no longer go
to Hurlingham if it was persisted in there,
he joined in a law-suit against the club
trustees in a final effort to keep the game
alive.
Bernice Agar made this new picture of
Phil AlacLachlan,
who, though only 10,
is one of our most
promising black-and-
white artists. Her
work is done to
thumb-nail rule, and
she can lit the in-
terior of a lady’s
boudoir, no detail
omitted, on a board
no larger than a
postage stamp. She
has exhibited with
the Women Painters,
and is on the con-
tributing staff of Art
in Australia. Her
father is lawyer A.
J. AlacLachlan, of
Bellevue Hill.
Noel Tregarthan and Molly Bethune are
engaged, lie is a son of the good-looking
Oxford man whom everyone knew and liked
as “Treg” and of a daughter of Justice
Manning, of the Supreme Court. Her father
is Frank Bethune, the well-known barrister
and Union Clubbite.
Another engagement is that of Ethel
Davey, whose male parent is a solicitor, to
Philip Browne, who pursues a similar call-
ing in the interests of Stephen, Jaques and
Stephen. He is a popular member of the
Union Club.
An interesting new visitor to Sydney is
Miss Little, who is staying with Mrs. Tony
Hordern. She is no relation, either, of the
young man whom Jean Morton married, or
of the girl whom the Prince admired so
much. In point of fact she is English, and
she dabbles in one of those strange new
creeds which are full of mystery and instinct
with searchings into, the future and re-
searches into the past. As a (strictly
amateur) -fortune-teller she is alleged to be
in the genius class.
The Philip Mortons are leaving Pareli,
where they have lived for many years, and
taking to flat-life. They have their eye on
half the Sid Walfords’ Edgecliff home.
Mrs. Eric Riddoford, who is one of
Maoriland’s prettiest women and who “goes
everywhere” in Sydney, is here again. She
has a fiat at Hampton Court.
Mrs. Box, Melba’s sister, will stay at
Honolulu on her way to England next month
and not reach London till October. When
she gets there she will find the diva await-
ing her. t
At a North Shore dancing-class the other
night two sauev girls, daughters of a mem-
ber of the local nobility, conceived the idea
of brightening things up by dousing the glim,
and to this end they bribed a small raga-
muffin to sneak into the vestibule and mani-
pulate the electric switch. Darkness fell in
the middle of a fox-trot, and some few girls
realised what Moses might be expected to
do when the candle went out. Later, after
the light had been resurrected, three sets of
maidenly eyes were dimmed with tears, when
it was found that during the dark spell some
thief (most probably the anonymous hire-
ling who turned off the illumination) had
got away with three fur coatees, two of them
valued at £80 —the property of the gay girls
who had engineered the joke.
From a returned presswoman :
Few of the younger Australian artists in the
semi-student chrysalis stage seem to realise that
Europe is no longer a place where struggling- genius
can buy three meals a day at prices suited to light
purses. Eggs were 7s. a dozen when I was in
France last February. That knocks the yolk out
of the Paris omelette! The exchange is supposed
to be in our favor. As a fact, the Continental mind
now thinks in English when Australian or British
tongues begin to wag. Clothes—it' they have a
price-ticket on —are fairly reasonable, while the
pound sterling mops up 48.50 francs. But very
often shop-windows are innocent of the cost of their
best garments, and up goes the price to meet the
crisis in exchange. Anyhow, 1 heard of two young
Australian artists in Paris who were making earnest
inquiries as to the chances, firstly, of getting back
to London, and, secondly, of melting the marble
heart of Australia House re assisted passages home.
The T. J. Ryan widow passed through
Sydney last week. She has been down in
Melbourne finishing the libel action brought
by her husband against the Hobart Mer-
cury shortly before bis death. A jury had
decided against big Tom J„ who then ap-
pealed, but Death caught him before the
appeal came on, and the widow, in spite
of all her friends’ advice, carried on the
fight. The dreary business dragged out for
months, but was brought to a sudden close
a week or so ago by the Mercury deciding
to settle out of court. Mrs. Ryan has now
gone back to her old Bananaland home.
Later on her boy goes to Xavier’s in Mel-
bourne, which was his father’s training-
ground.
St. Ignatius’ Old Boys’ Union is remark-
ing that tickets for the annual hop on June
13 are limited in number, and that you
should borrow a feather from the tail of
the early bird and make prompt application
at Nicholson’s or to members of the com-
mittee.
John Roseby, secretary for the N.S.W
Benevolent Society, is hatching a special
scheme to provide the Paddington Women’s
Hospital with a £50,000 outfit of feathers to
fly with. The Govt. Savings Bank has lent
a set of offices in Penzance Chambers as an
incubator, and in the meanwhile one gener-
ous unknown has dropped £5OOO into the
collection-box.
On May 31 the Junior Red Cross bursts
into its third annual exhibition, and the
vice-regal -Davidsons will offer congratula-
tions and duly prize the thing open at 8 p.rn.
Lady Forster will be the social heavyweight
on the second day, and Gaud Mayor M<-
Elhone’s lady will bestow municipal appro-
val upon the distribution of first-aid certi-
ficates.
Some of the youngsters of the Sistine
Choir have been petted to such an extent
that luxury is beginning to eat into their
bones. One night during the week it started
to rain just when the boys were leaving the
Hotel Mansions for the Town Hall. Where-
upon they refused to stir without motor-cars.
Their tutor was firm about the tram-car
being good enough—equally firm were the
strikers about the necessity for motors.
Finally the news was transmitted to Bella
over the telephone. He demanded that one
of the youngsters should come to the ’phone
—any one: he wasn’t particular. And pre-
sently a group of very subdued small boys
climbed into the William-street tram. But
the concert was 20 minutes late.
Judge lleydon presided at a meeting of
the women’s committee of St. Margaret’s
Hospital early this week. Sister Kervin led
in tea-drinking. Subsequently there was
some deep talk about the cretonne costumes
which are to he worn at the Wentworth on
the 33 st, when a dance occurs in aid of the
hospital.
The Browning bacillus breaks out in the
most unexpected places. One afternoon last
week Baby-welfare Innes Noad caused a
flutter in the Lyceum Club by declaiming
"just like an actor” the ardent passages in
“t’ippa Passes” and adding an extra layer
of sweetness to some of the smaller poems.
Norman Carter has an interesting show
at his studio in Vickery’s Chambers. There
are three-quarter lengths of Hugh Denison
and the woolly Vicars; Gruner is shown
perpetrating one of his own canvases —i
vivid likeness —and W. A. Holman’s portrait
is another striking success.
Mrs. Libby Hordern has got back to Syd-
ney after a long spell abroad, only to talk of
a speedy return to London. She mentions a
month as about her limit so far as N.S.W.
is concerned.
Artist Ethel Stephens shares a flat and
studio in Paris with Mrs. Phillips Fox, who
has just had another canvas hung in the
Paris Salon. She talks of returning to Syd-
ney at the end of the year.
A postscript from Brisbane: —
A well-known Brisbane woman and her daughter
were recently married to a father and son respect-
ively. The elder man, who is 69, has at bride of
25, and his son of 48 has achieved a wife his own
age. The quartette met while travelling in the
South, and old Kosciusko witnessed the courtship.
The elder groom afterwards received word that he
had inherited a brother’s Scotch estate valued at
£42,000, and all four are now on their way to the
heather.
There recently returned to Brisbane a lady who
won a much-talked-of divorce case 17 years ago.
In England she married an actor, who died, leaving
her with an infant and a comfortable income. Later
she wedded an Italian merchant, and with him and
her pretty daughter of 15 she is visiting old friends
here. The lady’s first husband (now a widower),
with his quiverful of youngsters, was on the train
which bore the visitors from Sydney.

Weaning time
for baby is
“Benger time.”
Weaning time need not
check development nor render
baby fretful. The transition
stage from the breast to
normal food is the stage when
Benger’s should be given to a
breast-fed baby.
ď
Food
is always prepared with fresh
new milk. It does more than
enrich the milk with valuable
food elements ; it adjusts the
milk itself to the delicate
digestion of a child. Baby
takes the change happily and
without check.
THE BOOK OF BENGER’S FOOD
is a medically approved guide to
the rearing of Infants and the
careof Invalids. Every household
should possess a copy. Write for
it to-day post free.

The Song of the Bird.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
JADED with wine and women, cards
and dice,
The evil cloying sense of too much
power,
Looked from me window-slit the jewelled
King
To where along the skyline, feathery-green,
Or softened into distance, cloudy-blue,
.Stretched the wide forest, climbing to the
spur
Of the bare granite hill of moveless hate,
Wherein dwelt his old rival, driven there
As some grey wolf is driven to his cave
To starve and snarl, and never yield his pride
To come forth fawning at his conqueror’s
knee,
Ready to slip a cowed neck in the band....
But even of this driving tired the King.
He saw the antlers of his spotted deer
Lift bluntly from the riot of the fern;
He saw the fat beeves lumbering on the down,
The splendid chargers of his men at arms;
He saw the Queen in her new yellow robe,
Her blue eyes red with weep.ng to. a's
frown;
He saw the dimpled, hronze-liaired waiting-
maid,
Whom he had kissed so close, lose insolence,
Dwindling like some blown bubble from his
sneer,
Fingering a little doubtfully the chain
Of turquoise he had hung about her neck.
He saw r them all with disillusion’s eye;
Nothing seemed left within his heart but
hate
And rotting boredom, and lie cried aloud
To his slim harper: "Is there anyone
Who, owning neither turf nor towers, yet
■sings
From very gladness that he is alive?”
And from the forest came a pipe of sound,
80 thin and small and wonderfully sweet,
But most of all so marvellously glad,
Even the Queen began to wipe her eyes.
The waiting-maid to dream afresh of chains
Of love, more dear than sky-blue turquoises;
A wench laughed somewhere in the sculleries,
A turn-spit in the kitchen whistled shrill,
And “Silence all those varlets!” roared the
King.
So silence fell again on those vast halls,
Muffled with tapestry or marble-floored —
Silence except for that small wild bird’s
voice.
It seemed to climb the outer stairs and mount
The shallow steps that were gay-carpeted
With strips from Persia, flowering gorgeous
dyes.
It echoed round the vases tall and gold
And seemed to flood their hollowness with
song;
It trickled o’er the burnished mirror’s face,
Slipped in and out the empty morions
Above the armor in the dining-hall;
It turned the pale priest from his breviary,
Invaded where long-bearded counsellors
Pored over curling parchment documents
Till the stamped purple seals began to dance
A jig some goat-foot Pan taught long ago
To rosy nymphs w'ith oak-leaves in their
hair!
And then those reverend sires began to
dream,
And fidgeted, and looked to where the light
Endeavored to peer through the frosted glass,
Or drain a rainbow from the leaded pane,
Deeming they saw in ripples on the floor
Frail fairies in a waving morris dance.
Then they pushed back their horn-rimmed
spectacles
To see the closer with their rheumy eyes,
And ran their shaking lingers timmgh ui> .
beards,
Watching each other slyly for a word
The while some wretched outlaw s warrant
lay
Waiting the pressure of the monarch’s
ring
And up into the attics went the song,
And down among the dusty vats of wine,
Shaking the cobwebs that sly spiders spun,
The Bip Van Winkles of the cellarage.
The Princess shut within her lonely tower,
On bread and water for a foolish love,
Lifted her dark head from her ’broidery
frame
And saw far off a growing patch of blue
With one frail shred of cloud that seemed
to shape
A lover’s knot; and so she laughed again
And fell to planning silken ladders swung
From narrow windows down to grass and
flowers,
For such a ladder made that chain of song,
Woven of open spaces and of twigs
Erect and brown with crests of baby leaves.
And shifting light and shadow on the sward
And the warm smell of acorns in the sun
And resins of the pines and chestnut burrs
And cowslips, pale as strayed sunbeams that
fear
(Seduced by luring leaves) that they are
lost.
And up and up the song climbed to the flag
That struck the war note on its stalwart
staff
Over the turrets and the architraves
Until the Queen piped “ ’T'is an eagle sings,
Some wizard charmed to rival nightingales.
Surely its wings must make the forest dark,
So great the throat that shapes so sweet a
song!”
And the King glowered on her, as husbands
will,
And called her fool who had mistaken noise
For sweetness, and sent forth his archer men
To slay the bird that would not let him
rest.
Fine men were these same archers, clad in
green.
With peacock feathers in their hats, and
boots
Of fox-red russet, and with polished boughs
Of doughty yew. And many an arrow sped
Intent on murder, yet none found the bird !
And when the mellow sun sloped to the west
And the impertinence of early stars
With quivering mirth observed the hunter
foiled,
Chagrined with failure, these brave men re-
turned ;
For nowhere had an arrow pierced the bird,
There was no eagle in the sheltering wood.
Yet at moonrise the song began again!
The bearded counsellors took heart to stroll
Among the moonlit verdure at the edge
Expounding poets. And the Princess sat
High in her tower and twisted silken coils
Till they were strong enough to bear her
weight
When they should ripple down the castle
wall. . . .
And the Queen smirked and jested with the
page
And saw the King’s Cupbearer look at her
In such a way as might have roused the
, King,
Had he not been too busy vowing death
To that mad bird that made a song of moons
And threaded melodies into the stars.
At dawn he set his armored knights to tilt
With their long lances up among the boughs;
And though they stood, majestic and erect.
In their short stirrups, not a feather fell!
But far into blue heaven they heard the song
Tearing apart the web of summer cloud.
And it was full of youth and hope and joy
And turned their hearts to honey as they
rode!
The noontide smote them through the bending
Iwughs;
The clean, dry wind of afternoon arose,
Shuffling the brake about the foxes’ lair
And blowing seeds to drowsy partridges,
Ruffling the wings of larks upon the nest,
Making a fleet of dead leaves, drifting down
To the still surface of a woodland pool,
Crackling amid the reeds and stealing from
The horns of honeysuckle slow perfumes....
The sweat dripped from the brows of
armored knights;
They loosed the visor that the wind might
play
Like maids’ cool fingers on the bearded cheek.
And presently they turned towards the
towers
With parched mouths, thinking tankards of
strong ale,
And swore that bird was but a phantom
thing.
At which the King grew jaundiced in his
wrath
And talked of hanging and of quartering.
They set the weighty cannon by the wood,
They planted standards on the open turf,
Declared outlawry to the radiant voic* . .. .
The King forgot his foejnan in the hills
(Until the Wolf stole forth to harry him
And take a heavy toll of ewes and beeves).
But still the bird sang when the moon was
high
Or when the sun broke over those green
crests.
Turning the green to rose and cadmium,
And far away men heard the foxes’ cry....
Above it all that bird sang of young love
And fairy laughter... .Till the Princess fled
With Love beside her in bis shabby cloak
When all the earth was dark with summer
storm
And Lightning rode his white horse in the
hills,
Striking strange splinters from his silver
hoofs.
The forest branches parted as she came
To let her through ; the mosses underfoot
Deadened the sorrel’s quick, impatient feet,
So that she passed in safety to her love,
Passed to that other kingdom in the hills
Which is the kingdom happy women know...
And in one silver splinter from the sky,
Outlining sharply every dwindling bough,
She told her bridegroom that she saw the
bird.
It was a tiny thing of dusty brown,
Scarce bigger than the twig it rested on.
The storm drove outward to the waiting sen.
Naked as some sweet babe. Dawn left the
hills
And grew to mighty stature on the plain,
With cincture of pale mists about his loins
And all his hair one wave of copper light.
He leapt the castle turrets and looked in
Upon the empty pallet, saw the shoe
Cast off, the satin sheath that was her gown,
The fine pearl girdle snapped. Then rose
the King
And tore the silken night-robe from his
limbs
And seized the heavy sceptre in his hand.
Frothing at mouth and twitching with his
hate
Like one possessed. The Queen clung to his
knees.
He bruised her body as he cast her off
And raved and shrieked and bade all stand
aside;
For he himself would find and slay that bird
That made a feckless wanton of his maid
And turned his warriors’ hearts to curd and
whey.
And so they stood and watched him from the
wall,
The priest with holy water in his hands,
Archer and knight and cooks with aprons
tied
And ogling waiting-maid and kitchen wench,
As he raged out into the forest’s green
Where every leaf hung tiny gems of dew.
And quivering like a wind among the boughs
Came that strange, endless harmony of song,
Which held the echoes of the whirling
spheres,
The low of far-off cattle in the byre,
And lovers’ lutes and gentle cradle songs....
The rustling mantle of the forest closed
Above the noisy fury of the King.
The fool who followed with his cap and bells.
Being a fool, the only one who dared
Follow his master into mystery.
Told afterwards how the great King climbed
on,
Pulling himself from rocking branch to
branch.
An ape with shreds of purple on his thighs
And gold la£e mixed with blood, where splin-
ters tore
His flaccid arms. But madness made him
strong;
And presently he reached the swaying crest
Which was the green foundation of the song.
Down to the earth he fell: within his hand
A tiny bunch of feathers. Came a cry,
A scatter of bruised leaves, a crumpled thing
Of strips of gold and velvet, bones and hair
And pampered flesh that once had been a
king.
Still holding in one hand a staff of gold—
A ruby in the metal red as fire.
And, as the fool with laughter and with
tears—
Laughter for things groteseque that kings
became
And tears because this was his master still—
Took from the mangled hand the lifeless bird,
Far up among the boughs he heard the song
Entangled in the branches, drifting on.
Piercing, triumphant to the Gates_of God.
QUEENSLAND.

The Family Tree.
[FOR THE BULLETIN]
JACKSON rode up to the fence as Bill
Saunders was putting an edge on
his axe.
"Yer goin’ to cut it down, Bill?” He
looked idly at the tree.
“Yaas. Come offer that swing, you kids.”
“What, yer goin’ to take it down, true,
Bill?”
“I said I was. What the blazes ?
Come down offer that swing.”
The kids fixed the seat a little tighter and,
standing on the old board, they swung out
over Bill’s head fearlessly. He dodged aside
with an oath, and the swinging went on. So
did the sharpening of the axe.
The old tree, thick anil flowery and full of
bees, creaked to the accompaniment of the
.swinging and the sharpening of Bill's axe
as the oilstone lightly licked the edge.
The tree was a red-gum, with wide, spread-
ing branches, and the pendant leaves drooped
like a cloak of emerald lace above Bill’s
head. Sometimes the creamy-white blos-
soms fell all over him, and, once or twice,
a couple of florets, sticky with honey to which
plump brown and yellow bees were greedily
clinging, touched his shoulders. Rains had
been good, and the old tree was fairly drunk
with honey and perfume and sweetness.
“It won’t make any sort of a log, Bill.
Too bumpy, and the kids have got it knocked
about a bit.” Jackson flung a lazy leg over
his saddle, and, taking out a plug of tobacco,
began to cut it up leisurely with his pocket-
knife, putting each piece in the palm of one
hand casually as he cut it, and casually rub-
bing the other palm against it while he
watched Bill.
“I ain’t euttin’ it down for timber,” re-
torted Bill, looking aggressively at the kids
again.
“No? That so?” Jackson knocked his
empty pipe on his boot, blew at the stem
and then sucked at it dryly as he continued
to slowly crush the tobacco for filling. “Re-
member the time we tried to hang Yellow
Charley by his pigtail over that there limb?
Gripes! Yer ole man went sore on us, didn’t
he? Thought we’d done fer the ole Chow.
Remember, Bill?”
“Or —yes. Grown up a bit since them silly
days. Here ! Come down outter that, Nelly
and Tom. Orright! Serves youse right, you
little fools, if the tree falls and smashes youse
up. I don’t care.”
Jackson filled his pipe leisurely, pressed the
tobacco down with a lazy little finger, lit it
leisurely and took a luxurious draw.
The afternoon was cool, not a bit like sum-
mer, and Jackson was never in a hurry,
never worried about anything, never upset
by the least trouble.
“Well, .so long, Bill.” He picked up his
lazy bridle-reins.
“So long,” said Bill, and proceeded to take
off his boots as Jackson moved away. If
the kids would not come down from the
swing he would have to climb the old tree
anti loosen the rope and drop them down —
swing and all.
Creak ! Creak ! Crash ! Down came the
swing and the kids. The leafy peace of
summer was split with a howl of wailing
youngsterhood.
“There y’are. Knew yer’d do it. ’Urt
yerseives? Serves youse well right.”
“800 ! 1100 ! Yah ! It was your fault,
you brute. Want to take down the swing-
tree to put up an ole shed. I’ll tell on
you. You”—— Nelly’s threat was cut
short by the dislodgment of a front tooth,
which had come out in her fall. “There
y’are. Broken me jaw all up, you have.
Oh, ma, ma, ma! Bill’s been and knocked
out aller me teeth.”
“Shudup, you fool,” admonished Tom,
Aviping her face with her pinafore. “Y’ought
to be glad it was knocked out. Wasn’t it
loose ?”
“Yah. Yes. But he oughtn’t be
let”
“You look out unless you want the tree
to fall and break yer back like it broke old
Hogan’s.”
The kids stood back and watched their
eldest brother continue his axe-sharpening.
Bill, like Jacksion, was in no particular
hurry. The swing was down now. The
old rope had given way. There was no
hope of saving their favorite play-place.
OJd Martha Brown drove up in her spring-
cart as Bill was about to make the first
cut. She pulled up in passing.
"You going to take the old tree down,
Bill?”
“Yaas. Now, get away from me less you
want a chip in yer eyes, you kids.” He
swung the axe.
“Ah, your old grandma ’d turn in her
grave if she knew her ole tree was coming
down. Well, well, well! I remember the time
when she used to kiss it, she used, and”
“Eh?” Bill let the axe slip and checked
a desire to tell old Martha to mind her own
business.
The kids bv this time were busy with the
new rope which Bill had brought down to
assist him in the felling of the tree. The
tree was near the fence and near the road
and near the homestead, too; but lie saw
that he could bring it down quite easily in
the direction of tire open paddock without
damaging anything. He would not want
the new rope.
“Come on, while ’e’s talking to old
Martha,” said Tom. “You help me up,
Nelly.”
Old Martha’s voice droned on.
“Yes, your grandma used to kiss it because
she loved it, and she used to sit there under
that branch. No, now I come to think of
it, she always liked the branch nearer the
house. The tree wasn’t so tall then. And your
ma used to lie out on the grass beside her
and kick and crow so pretty-—and your pa—
God rest his soul! —said whatever happened
he’d never cut down the old tree where yer
ma kicked up as a baby.”
“Orr,” Bill took up his axe again. “It’s
goiter come down. Coin’ to put up a bit of
toolshed here. Best outer the road.
Kids ’ill .break their neck offer the swing
yet.”
Old Martha pulled aside the spring-cart
to let Corrigan’s dray go by, and Corrigan
stopped when he saw Bill Saunders.
“Coin’ to cut down the old tree. Bill?” he
said, leaning over the fence. “Well, ain’t
that a pity—it so beeuteeful and all. I mind
the time when yer old ma siiot at a black-
feller and struck that tree and”
"Eh?” Bill dropped the axe again.
“Yes —yer old ma”
“He means yer grandma, Bill,” put in old
Martha. But Corrigan was going on. ’
“Ah. Yer old ma was a game ’un. She
never cried but once, and that was under
this tree just after burying her first-
born”—
“Yes.” Old Martha pointed with the
green stick, which she was using in place
of a whip. "There’s the rose she planted
over it—in the grass there. Oh, well!
You’ll smash that rose when the tree falls,
Bill.”
Bill took up his axe uneasily.
“It’s gotter come down,” he said.
But Corrigan was musing again. “I mind
the time yer old ma’s ma, that was ninety-
odd years and more —she was —used to run
arouud that tree and chase you up it, yer
young limb you was then, Bill —’bout four
or so. She thought she was a little girl
in Ireland herself. But, by Jingo, she could
run, she could. Nearly beat you, Bill.”
“Ah, yes.” Old Martha leaned over and
nudged Corrigan with her stick. “And
what about the time the old lady caught
you kissin’ Bill’s ma round the other side
there. Ah, ha! That was at the picnic we
had down here. We all thought Mr. Corri-
gan was goin’ to marry yer ma until yer
poor dear pa—God rest his soul! —came and
cut him out.”
“Eh?” Bill looked from one to the other
of the old people quizzically. Then he quite
unnecessarily used his oilstone on the axe.
“Oh, well. Good-day, Bill.” Corrigan
had gone, leaving a trail of dust behind him.
“Tell yer ma she can have that extra bag
of chaff if she wants it still, Bill,” said old
Martha. “Good-day. I must be getting
along.”
“Good day and good riddance,” swore
Bill, sharpening his axe-blade quicker,
though by this time it was so sharp that
it would easily have shaved his hairy, brown
arm. Then he stuck a hard, splintered finger
in the crack of the trunk where Tom and
Nelly had carved their names long ago, cover-
ing over the spot where his old ina’S bullet
had probably struck the long-dead bark. He
gave an uncertain glance at the rose-tree,
where a single, reddish-pink rose was bloom-
ing over the little grave dug by mother-hands
so long ago. Then he caught sight of Tom
and Neily struggling to get the new rope
over the branch of the tree where the old
swing had been. They had got up the tree
while he had been talking and he made a
grab at the new rope.
“You’ll break you —- necks,” he said.
“Come down, you little devils, or” ——
“Haven’t you cut that tree down yet,
Bill?” called out his mother from the stock-
yard. She did not want the lovely old tree
to come down, for it had been a landmark
for. nearly a hundred years now —forty of
which were still green with memories for
her —memories of little bush comedies and
tragedies that had been, enacted around it.
“You can come and give me a hand with
“Bally’ when you’ve done. She’s got sore
teats again.”
“Orright.”
Since the chestnut had rolled on pa and
the people of the township had followed him
reverently to the graveyard on the hill over-
looking the river, Bill had been general boss
and manager of the selection, llis mother
seldom interfered with what little changes
he made about the place.
But now, for a moment, she watched him
wistfully as he walked round the old tree,
obviously selecting the best side for the first
cut. She turned with a little sigh to her
milking. Of course the tree had to c-ome
down. Bill was right. That was just the
place for the new toolshed he wished to
put up. Bill walked twice round- the old
tree and the kids came down, leaving the
new rope hanging on the limb.
“Get out, you kids,” lie said suddenly.
“Get out. Cut inside as quick as you
legs can carry you, or I’ll well skin
yer hides”
When Bill began to talk like that and let
his eyes rove quickly from side to side with
a little light rolling movement, it was time,
everyone knew, to "get fer yer life.”
Half an hour later the tree, was still there
and a new swing was dangling from the
branch where the old swing had broken
down.
“You didn’t cut it down, Bill,” said his
mother, taking the milk to the dairy. She
stood a moment, thin and brown and hollow-
cheeked, regarding the tree tenderly.
Bill grunted.
“No,” lie said. “Silly place fer a shed
anyway—right near the road. Want every-
one to come in and steal the tools and things'/
Where’s the kids?”
Tom and Nelly came down and saw the
new swing.
“Oh, Bill!”
“Now, shut up or I’ll give you a clout.
Go on. Get on the pair uv yus. Now!”
Bill cuffed Nelly’s check lightly. “Half and
half, miss. Move up and give Tom half
the seat. Ough, yer little devil, y’uve sat
on me finger.” lie cuffed her again. But
Nelly wriggled delightedly. “Now, ribuck?
Stick yer arm round of the little fool, Tom.”
He took the swing by the seat, “Ribuck?”
he shouted once again.
“Y-a-aS, Yftirs,” came the kid-chorus.
“Well, keep your feet offer me head, there.
Yah ! Y’ve poked yer toe in me eye.” Bill
butted at wriggling Nelly with his head and
Nelly squealed ecstatically - in anticipation
of her flight through the air when Bill would
finally begin to swing them.
“Now !”
Bill gave the swing a push off. Then,
as the motion became more even, higher and
higher he swung the children, until Nelly’s
flying sandy hair seemed mixed with Tom’s
bare little brown feet as they flew out over
the rose and the grass and the little grave.
The mother watched them a moment, then
went on into the dairy.
And the brown bees and the creamy blos-
soms poured a stinging perfume of peace
over them all.

For Your Stomach
The stomach is the largest organ in the
body and has important work to do.
It does it well, most of the time, so long
as you give it proper food and do not
over-load it. But sometimes it gets tired,
and a sick headache, biliousness, indigest-
ion, acidity and other symptoms warn
you that it is out of order and needs
help. Then it is time to take

PUBLIC NOTICE-
Extract from letter of 11th January, 1922, received by
JAMES WATSON & COMPANY LIMITED, SYDNEY,
from their Principals at Dundee, Scotland. —IT SPEAKS
FOR ITSELF.
“The question of price must, as in the past, be based
on quality. We could, as you can understand, ship
cheaper whisky, but there does not seem any ultimate
advantage, either to our customers or to ourselves,
in doing so; besides, we would not associate our
name with the re-sale of Scotch Whisky three years
old. There is also the wider question of policy—
whether we are to come down to compete with the
cheapest, or whether we are to STAND on QUALITY
AT OUR PRICE. We believe we will gain prestige
by the latter course.”
