MARCUS CLARKE
The review-copy of Brian Elliott’s
Marcus Clarke (Clarendon Press) has
arrived somewhat belatedly at “The
Bulletin” office, but it would be a pity
on that account not to take some notice
of it; for not only does it give us a lot
of information about that hitherto
rather shadowy Melbourne bohemian
who wrote “For the Term of His
Natural Life,” with a well-balanced
critique of his work, but also it is, in its
modest way, a model of what the
literary biography should be. Any-
body proposing to write the lives of
other Australian writers —so many of
whom urgently need a biographer—
would do well to study it.
The common faults of the amateur in
biography are diffuseness and senti-
mentality: too much about the hero’s
family and background, too much
about his period and his friends, at
the expense of a clear focus upon the
man himself; and too much of a
tendency to gush about the hero,
especially over his childhood, merely
because he happened to write books
for a living, as other men happen to
climb mountains or play billiards. Some
amateurs —the utterly inexcusable —
even go so far as to invent imaginary
dialogue, so that the thing becomes
an uneasy and wholly unreliable sort
of historical fiction.
None of this for Brian Elliott.
He finds out, of course, who the
Clarkes were—Marcus Clarke’s father
was a lawyer in Dublin and London;
other members of the family had
emigrated to Australia to become
Governors, Agent-Generals and judges.
He tells the romantic story of the
father’s marriage to a girl whom he
more-or-less adopted and had educated.
He corrects an impression that might
be derived from one of Marcus Clarke’s
stories, “Human Repetends,” that the
father lived in a state of excessive wit
and wickedness; and, of course, he
fully stresses the drama of the collapse
of the family fortunes (which sent
Marcus Clarke to Australia) when it
became so painfully clear that he would
inherit, not £70,000 as he had imagined,
but only a few hundreds. But all this
is told very quickly and clearly.
Brian Elliott was not able to discover
very much, in precise detail, about
Marcus Clarke’s boyhood. So, instead
of speculating too much as to what he
may have been like and how he may
have lived, he quotes a description by
Cyril Hopkins, Marcus’s boyhood and
lifelong friend, and it is enough: you
can see that he was then, as he was all
his life after, charming and high
spirited;—
Hopkins credited Clarke with a
natural bonhomie and tact as a
schoolboy which caused others to
like him even while they considered
him odd ; and with everything went
the sound of his “silvery laughter.”
As a schoolboy Clarke had a
stammer which he never entirely
overcame. It was slight and merely
added the charm of hesitation to an
already attractive form of speech.
It is the same when Clarke comes
to Melbourne and, after dabbling in
journalism, writing a few light pieces
for the stage and 400 pages of a novel,
takes a job —probably through the
influence of Judge Clarke, his uncle —
in the Bank of Australasia. With the
utmost economy, yet with ample space
for a picture of the dashing young man
“with the problematical moustache and
a valiant attempt at sidewhiskers” and
for a discussion as to whether he was
the life and soul of the bank or “an
intolerable nuisance,” Brian Elliott has
him swiftly out of Melbourne and up
the country buying gold for the bank,
where we have Clarke’s own words (in
a letter to Hopkins) as to what the life
was like and how he enjoyed the nights
with the wild diggers:—
I who am seated by a log-fire,
feebly smoking and covered with
mud, reply, “Thanks, I’ve just
liquored up!”
“Oh, that be d d! Here,
mate! A nobbier for this b !”
.... until the manager and I slink
off to bed. About 4 a.m. two
ruffians come upstairs, and one,
very drunk, mistakes the sofa
whereon I am courting Morpheus
for his bed and, as he has spurs on,
I am speedily awakened, but, with
the assistance of my chum, eject
him. He falls downstairs and attacks
all below; there is a scrimmage for
some minutes, when someone shouts
nobblers round and all is quiet.
There is a similarly economical
account, again enlivened by Marcus
Clarke’s vivid letters, of his experiences
as a jackeroo after he had left the bank;
and then another episode, the “shatter-
ing” expedition to Queensland when
Clarke set out to make his fortune and
lost everything, that is so economical
as to be disappointing. There is one
tremendous letter to Hopkins—“ Suffice -
it to say that we lost about three
hundred pounds each; that our horses
died and our cattle were drowned by
floods; that fever set in and that we
were all taken ill. One poor devil, the
Hungarian, Max Kabat, died and was
buried in the bush ” —and very
little more.
Still, in its terseness, this disaster is
perhaps all the more moving; and if,
as Brian Elliott says, “There is nothing
more to be learned of ‘this infernal
Queensland business’ beyond what the
letter tells us,” that is that.
There is a more legitimate cause for
complaint in the biographer’s refusal to
step aside from his theme even to dis-
cuss at any length so tempting a subject
as Gerard Manley Hopkins—Cyril,
Marcus Clarke’s correspondent, was
Gerard’s brother, and both were
Clarke’s boyhood friends—and in the
brevity of his outline of the Yorick
Club, where, as a journalist in Mel-
bourne, Clarke hobnobbed with such
historic figures as Adam Lindsay
Gordon and George Gordon McCrae.
But once again it is all, though briefly,
there; and perhaps it is enough that
there is one extraordinary glimpse of
Adam Lindsay Gordon pitching
Marcus Clarke up to the ceiling and
catching him coming down; and in any
case this reviewer is not going to make
any serious complaint against a
biographer who so resolutely sticks to
his point . . . which in this instance is

A PLAN BEHIND QUEMOY
'THE dangers residing in dictator-
A ships are in direct ratio to the
megalomania of the dictator.
Comrade Khrushchev has been so
open in his bullying that his charac-
teristics are familiar to all. Comrade
Mao, as great a paranoiac and as
dangerous as his Moscow congener and
his German forerunner, has not been
so much in the limelight as a bully.
That he is not less dangerous or feral
than his ally is shown by his thesis
on “War and Strategy” and his
plan for world conquest, loosed in
Moscow in 1953 and well worthy of
one who had written that “every Com-
munist must grasp the truth that power
grows out of the barrel of a gun.”
The 1953 plan, unearthed by Senator
Knowland and read into the American
Congressional Record on April 29,
1953, seems to provide a very valid
reason why the Americans should fear
the recent conjunctions of Khrushchev
and Mao and place the most frightening
interpretations on current events, lead-
ing them to insist at any cost on keeping
Mao bottled-up inside his own realm.
This exposition of the theory of
Communist conquest began by paying
tribute to the fact that the success of
Communism after World War II both '
in Europe and Asia was “entirely
attributable to Comrade Stalin’s able
and correct guidance and direction.”
Then it announced that “the time has
come when we have to look on Asia as
our immediate goal” and set-out a
specific plan for future action:—
(a) Leave Europe alone, because “forcible
measures (i.e., to produce local revolu-
tions) might bring about war, (b) con-
centrate on Asia, where “on the contrary
such tactics will yield an abundant
harvest,” (c) avoid world war because of
the immaturity of Communist bloc’s
anti-atomic protection, nudiear and agri-
cultural industrial potential, “until we
are certain of victory,” (d) carry on a
diplomatic offensive of which the key
intention was to be that, “The United
States must be isolated by all possible
means,” Britain “placated by being con-
vinced there is a possibility of settling
the issues between the East and West
and that the capitalist countries can live
in peace,” at the same time keeping in
mind that “opportunities for trade will
have a great influence on the British
mind.”
France’s fear of Germany was to be
exploited; Japan convinced that
“rearmament endangers instead of
guaranteeing her national security”
was “an expression of hostility towards
her potential friends.”
CO much for generalisations. The rest
of the programme was divided
under eight heads. Under the first,
“Military Preparedness,” it was pointed
out “as the final goal there should be
in South-east Asia” (after these areas
are liberated) “25-million well-trained
men who can be immediately mobilised
to serve two purposes force the
capitalist countries to keep on increas-
ing defence expenses until economic
collapse overtakes them”; second,
because
.... a mere show of force, when time is
ripe, will bring about the capitulation
of the ruling cliques of the countries to
be liberated.
The next point dealt with Koreab—
The Korean war could not be won as
a decisive victory because of our lack
of naval strength.
Comrade Stalin had “preferred to be
cautious” when it had been suggested
to him in 1951 “to make use of the
Soviet submarines in Asia under an
arrangement that the Soviet Union
would not be apparently involved in
the war.”.
Comrade Mao agreed with his view-
point that this action might “give the
capitalist imperialists the pretext for
expanding the war to the continent,”
and “until we are better equipped for
victory” (he thought) “it is to our
advantage to accept agreeable terms for
an armistice.”
“Formosa” covered the concept that
the island must be incorporated in
People’s China and that if seizure by
force was to be avoided the entry of
Communist China into the U.N. might
help to solve the problem and provide
at least for an intermediate step in a
U.N. trusteeship.
The Indo-China war was to be
carried on to such an extent .and in
such a way as to “make war extremely
unpopular among the French people
and the Americans extremely hateful
among Indo-Chinese.” Once the French
were driven out in a “face-saving
armistice,” “vigorous propaganda,
infiltration, forming united-fronts with
progressive elements in and out of
reactionary regimes” would accelerate
the process of liberation to a point at
which a “final stroke of force” would
accomplish the task.
After Indo-China had fallen to Com-
munism, argued Mao, Burma would
“fall into line, as a good foundation
there has already been laid,” the
“reactionary clique in Thailand would
capitulate,” Indonesia would “fall to
Communist hands like ripe fruit” and
“complete the circle round the Malay
Peninsula.” The British, “realising the
hopelessness of the situation, would
withdraw as quickly as they could.”
He added:—
We expect the whole process will be
completed by 19G0.. . .when China’s
military, economic and industrial power
'will be so developed that with a mere
show of force by the Soviet Union and
China, the ruling clique of Japan will
capitulate.... We must guard against
the possibility that the United States
will choose to have war at this moment.
She may even want the war earlier. The
defensive and offensive preparations of
the Soviet Union and China must there-
fore be completed before 1960....
Whether we can prevent the U.S. from
starting the war depends on our success
in isolating her.... If war can be
averted, the success of our peaceful
penetration of other parts of Asia is
almost assured.... 1n.... India only,
peaceful means should be adopted....
so as not to alienate ourselves from the
Arabic countries and Africa.
'TPHE problems of these latter
A countries, Mao remarked, “can
easily be solved by economic co-
operation. alliances, united-fronts and
coalitions” and completed by 1965,
after which a “wave of revolution
would sweep over the whole continent
of Africa” and drive the “imperialists
and colonisationalists into the sea.”
And “indeed this powerful movement
may have been under way much
earlier.”
Then, with “Asia and Africa dis-
connected with the capitalist countries
of Europe, there will be a total
economic collapse in Europe and a
capitulation will be a matter of course,
leaving Canada and South America in
the same hopeless and defenceless
position.” ■
TF all this were written in 1958 instead
A of 1952, as it was, it would provide an
excellent condensed description of the
Communist strategy and action in the
intervening six years and of its nearly
total success up to date.
It would also explain why the
United States, whose Foreign Affairs
Committee in the Senate was until
recently headed by Senator Knowland,
who unearthed the plan, is taking a
line which seems to some illogically
pig-headed and even untenable to pre-
vent the extension of Chinese military
influence into the sphere of Formosa,
from which it could dominate the
Philippines anci various air-routes and
the approaches to Japan by air.
The Mao plan needs much wider
understanding in the light of the
manner in which the immediate past
has followed its prescriptions and the
ugly shape of things to come which it
presages for the next few years.


THE PEACE GOD STRIKES HIS GONG


PLAIN ENGLISH
De Gaulle Succeeds
A feature of the reporting of the French
referendum-campaign is the manner in
which most writers stick to their ancient
obsessions propagated by the Communists
in the early post-war years when de
Gaulle thwarted their hope of taking over
a chaotic France. The main attack is
against the integrity of his lieutenants.
It must be granted that a good many
of those who have been behind him have
not been sterling characters, but anybody
who can name even a brace of sterling
characters behind any French revolution
—or most other revolutions for that
matter —deserves more than a free
holiday-trip to Europe and a couple of
washing-machines.
The long succession of saviors of
France since 1789 have been for the
most part a very average lot of suspect
politicians on the make, salted with a
few statesmen little regarded and now
nearly forgotten. Yet behind their
opportunism there was generally a cause
or an objective that got somewhere, and
in the case of the austere de Gaulle there
certainly is the normal one —the salvation
of France, which politically was falling
to pieces when he came out of his exile.
De Gaulle is not a popularity seeker,
but rather a dedicated missionary. In
1945 he could probably have worked him-
self into the position of a French Hitler
if he had been a conscious spellbinder.
But he eventually retired into obscurity,
to live modestly. At every stage of his
career until the present crisis his obvious
patriotism and sincere effort brought him
nothing but disappointment and the
hatred of the Left.
He could not have assumed control of
the interregnum if he had not had the
support of the bulk of French parties.
He could not have curbed the exuberance
of his followers if he had not been a very
strong man, nor shown the international
outlook which he has shown unless he
had a moderate and conciliatory outlook.
The referendum campaign which has
given de Gaulle temporary dictatorial
power has not been what would be called
a democratic campaign in English-speak-
ing countries, but the comic feature is
that the only people in France who seem
really worried about this are the Com-
munists.
There has proved to be no cause for
fear of a breach with Germany, no
danger of a break-up with Nato, though
de Gaulle showed during the Lebanon
crisis that he intended to be his own
master in foreign politics.
While de Gaulle was holding his dis-
cussions with Dr. Adenauer on September
14 the two great constitutional Left
parties held their congresses. The Radi-
cals at Lyons decided to support the new
Constitution by 716 to 544. They jetti-
soned Mendes-France, a dissident, for a
de Gaulle supporter. The Socialist con-
ference was more noisy, having a more
violent Leftist ingredient, a Trojan-horse
infiltration. But under the influence
particularly of M. Mollet, who expressed
his entire confidence in his chief and the
belief that he was the only man who
could settle the Algerian crisis, the con-
ference voted 2786 to 1176 for the
Constitution. The referendum repeated
the conference decisions.
The fact that Moscow was savage and
that Khrushchev entered the campaign
sent the Church to the side of de Gaulle
even more strongly, than because he is a
-practising Roman Catholic. In fact,
victory was almost a foregone conclusion
for “Oui”—the de Gaulle slogan was
probably the shortest on record —since
the only people to oppose it outside the
Communists and outlawed Algerian
Nationalists were Socialist extremists so
violent as to defeat their own arguments.
"High 81 Has a Birthday
Founded on October 1, 1883, Sydney
Boys’ High School celebrates its 75th
birthday this week. When the school was
first opened Alexander Stuart was
Premier of New' South Wales and George
Reid Minister for Instruction, in
which capacity he performed the official
opening ceremony. The first premises
occupied by the school were in an old
building, convict-built and designed by
Francis Greenway, which at an earlier
period had housed the St. James Church
of England primary school. David
Jones’ main store now stands on the
site. The building was two-storied and
the boys’ school was situated on the lower
floor, with its entrance in Castlereagh
Street; the girls had the upper floor and
entered from Elizabeth Street. George
Reid referred to this segregated coeduca-
tional system on the opening-day when he
spoke of the difficulty of finding premises
for the schools and said that the building
chosen, “having two different floors and
two distinct playgrounds, communicating
with opposite streets, gave me an oppor-
tunity for beginning both schools in a
speedy and economical mannerf” The
boys’ school holds a week’s seniority over
the girls.
In 1892 the boys’ school moved to a
new building in Mary Anne Street,
Ultimo, and in 1928 to its present location
at Moore Park. The first headmaster,
J. Waterhouse, was really only seat-
warming for J. Coates, who had been
appointed, but was not able to take up his
duties until January, 1884. Waterhouse
came back as head in 1896 and was in
charge for a long period. It was during
his headmastership that High became a
member of the A.A.G.P.S. —it had played
competitive sport with the various
member-schools since 1885. It is the only
Government high-school in the G.P.S.
competitions. High is alao.a foundation
member (1913) of the Combined High
Schools Amateur Athletic Association.
Third and fourth headmasters were
R. J. Hinder (1916) and C. R. Smith
(1919), and in 1925 G. C. Saxby became
the first Old Boy to take charge of the
school —he had been dux of the school
and a member of the teaching-staff. In
Saxby’s first year High competed in the
Head of the River race for the first time
—and won. It repeated its success in
1926 and 1927. Subsequent headmasters
have been F. McMullen (1934), J. H.
Killip (1936 ; his long reign beaten only
by Waterhouse), G. Barr (1952) and the
present head, K. J. Andrews, who took
over the post in 1955.,
Fifty-four boys were enrolled at High
in 1883, with a staff of four. Today’s
roll-call is 892, and the teaching-staff
numbers 38. The thousands who have
passeji through the school in its 75 years
include men who have made their mark
in all walks of life. They include a
Prime Minister (Sir Earle Page), three
admirals (Sir Leighton Bracegirdle, H. B.
Farncomb and C. Farquhar-Smith), an
archbishop (Most Rev. Justin Simonds,
R.C. Coadjutor-Archbishop of Mel-
bourne), a brace of bishops (Right Rev.
W. G. Hilliard, Coadjutor-Bishop of
Sydney, and the late Right Rev.
Branswick, Bishop of Gippsland), a Chief
Justice of N. S. Wales (the late Sir
Frederick Jordan) and an overcrowded
Bench of judges ; two Ambassadors (Sir
Alan Watt, Tokyo, and Howard Beale,
Washington); enough professors to staff
a couple of universities, and, very appro-
priately, almost as many high-school
headmasters. Add to these a swag of
doctors, barristers, solicitors, civil
servants, business executives and a whole
host of good fellows, many of whom will
be attending the anniversary dinner to be
held tonight (Wednesday) at David Jones’
restaurant on the original site of the
school.
Crumbling Markets
At the moment the wool market has
dashed all hopes of a substantial rise,
drought has been playing havoc in the
heart of pastoral Australia, and other
news affecting Australia’s markets has
not been bright or encouraging.
First it became clear that the world
was having a record wheat-harvest —in
the U.S., the U.S.S.R. and Europe in par-
ticular —good for the world, but with
grim repercussions for Australian wheat-
growers.
Next came the sensational events on
the base-metal markets. On September
18 the sudden fall in tin prices in London
from £730 to £640 was like a cold douche.
Tin had reached £1620 a ton during
the Korean crisis, and the price had been
stabilised for some time by the support
of a pool which apparently ran out of
the means to continue its support, result-
ing in the suspension of tin dealings on
the London Metal Exchange.
London advices attribute the crash to
the pool’s failure to stabilise futures as
well as the cash price rather than to
Soviet Union dumping, it being pointed
out that London sales this year were
unlikely, on present showing,- to nearly
reach the level of 25,000 tons, the amount
necessary to bridge the gap between
supplies from other sources and normal
demand.


Next came the United States decision
to cut by 20 per cent, imports of lead
and zinc, Australia’s most substantial
dollar-earners next to wool.
For Australia the position was worse
than appeared on the surface. The U.S.
cut is on the average imports 1953-57,
but for Australia this means a cut of
roughly 50 per cent, on current annual
exports.
The cries of anguish that went up in
Canberra, Broken Hill and other places
which depend largely on the American
market were heard round the world.
Mr. McEwen, Minister for Trade, told
the press in Ottawa that Australia was
“really angry” at the cuts, which would
reduce Australia’s dollar-income by the
equivalent of about £8.03 million. He
seemed to feel bewilderment that though
he had made the “strongest and most
fully documented objections,” both
through the Australian Ambassador and
by himself personally, his objections had
been “brushed aside in a most savage
decision.”
Ministerial pain at the restrictions was
nothing, however, to that exhibited in
Broken Hill. The secretary of the
Barrier Industrial Council said that
“widespread unemployment among
miners was feared” and that w'e are
“afraid, too, that it will cause a drop in
the lead-bonus, which comprises nearly
one-third of mineworkers’ incomes.”
He suggested that we should imme-
diately rush to acquire markets in
Communist China, which no doubt will
hear of this trend with glee, though
Communist policy scarcely aims to save
Australia from becoming lean.
What has happened is another indica-
tion that the age of realities is upon
us. The fairytale years are over. And
no matter how the markets of the world
move, Australia cannot control them and
cannot expect that the world will give
it special consideration in order to main-
tain a high lead-bonus or to guarantee
full-employment on a scale of prosperity
unmatched anywhere else in the globe.
It seems that if most Australians want
to maintain present standards of living
in a world of falling prices and increas-
ing competition they will have to do so
by their own efforts. Neither America
nor China will do it for them.
The New Capitalists
The nearer the Federal election gets, the
more mysterious the policy of Labor
seems to become.
It is little more than a week since E. J.
Ward proclaimed his faith in nationalisa-
tion in terms which would have delighted
his old sponsor, Jock Garden, and then,
for election purposes, indignantly repudi-
ated as a distortion what thousands of
people had heard him say.
Now two more prominent Labor
members have come into the arena.
One is Gough Whitlam, who has
announced that “the trend of the Federal
Labor party has been towards the aboli-
tion of State Parliaments,” with “central
control” and greater co-ordination
between the Federal Government and
local authorities.
There is no such plank in the Federal
platform, and Federal Labor has always
held itself up vigorously as the champion
of State rights while at the same time
keeping somewhere in the cupboard a
plan devised about 40 years ago under
which it was proposed to cut Australia
into 30 provinces, all dependent on and
subsidiary to the Commonwealth.
Dr. Evatt will probably find Whitlam’s
expression of view embarrassing, but not
more so than Ward’s gyrations or the
eel-like performance of Calwell on TV.
The smooth assurances of Calwell
suggest that he would be far more
successful as a novelist than as a states-
man. He “believed that an election was
a contract with the people.” He asked
innocently: “Why should we nationalise
industries?” And only echo answered
him: “Because the objective of the party
demands it as the single and sole purpose
of Labor.”
“Nationalisation,” Calwell said gently,
“is only to be used where private enter-
prise fails ; where it is necessary in the
public interest that instrumentalities
should be nationalised, or where it feels
private enterprise cannot provide finance
with which to start enterprise.”
What he failed to emphasise was that
Labor probably maintains privately that
all these pre-conditions for nationalisa-
tion already exist.
With both Ward and Calwell the odors
and accents of the past linger in the back-
ground of their present utterances. Was
there not a Calwell who a decade ago,
when the Socialist objective of Labor was
stated in its platform in exactly the same
words as today, shouted in the Sydney
Domain:
The capitalist system is collapsing and
we are going to take-over ... we will
pluck the I'owl.
It is no wonder Labor nervously
awaits what Calwell calls “Dr. Evatt’s
wonderful policy speech.” After the per-
formances of his henchmen in the past
few days it might contain almost any
recantation of Labor principles. It would
be no more startling than Messrs. Ward
and Calwell’s renunciation of nationalisa-
tion if he were to advocate that the present
Government stay in office to carry out
Labor’s policy of unswerving support for
the capitalist system.
Women and Men Employed
[From Canberra]
N. S. Wales proposals for equal pay for
both sexes give new interest to figures
prepared some time ago which showed
that more women than men were engaged
in new employment in Australia in 1956-
57 and that there had been a spectacular
drop in the number of additional men
taken on since 1955-56.
In 1955-56 male employment had
increased by 25,400 from a level of
2,000,500 in June, 1955, while female
employment increased by 20,400 from
738,500: The check showed, how r ever,
that the reduction in employment in the
manufacturing industries during 1956-57
was confined to female employment,
which declined by 2700.
In 1956-57, however, male employment
increased by only 600, while female
employment rose by 3600.
A.N.Z.A.A.S and Petroleum
[From L.. Owen]
The Melbourne meeting of the Australian
and New Zealand Association for the
Advancement of Science held in August,
1955, devoted a full morning session to
a symposium on petroleum geology. At
the Dunedin meeting in January, 1957,
the same subject was allotted only 90
minutes, including discussion ; while at
the Adelaide meeting last month no
provision was made for that very
specialised subject.
Several reasons can be put forward
for this decline in interest in the science
of petroleum. The general public has
become tired of the inducements offered
by promoters to invest in the search
for oil as, to date, these have produced
nothing more substantial than highly
optimistic prospectuses and reports ; but
the stock-market angle should not
materially affect the A.N.Z.A.A-S. policy,
and the causes of the shrinkage of its
petroleum publicity must be sought in
other directions.
It is, of course, very obvious that none
of the wildly optimistic forecasts made
at the 1954 meeting (when the Rough
Range oil-strike was a recent memory)
have materialised. This may be why
only a few of the 1958 Congress papers
even mention petroleum —and that mainly
in connection with analyses of post-
Triassic structures.
It appears to have been overlooked
that it is now generally admitted that
every examinable sample of crude petro-
leum obtained from any Australian
source has all the properties of a
migrated oil ; also that the one measure-
able “pool” of petroleum so far encoun-
tered owes its Cretaceous environment
to a concurrent set of geological circum-
stances of a very exceptional nature.
Drilling on Rough Range has produced
definite proof that neither the disposi-
tion of the migrated oil nor the form
of the oil-reservoir and the oil-water
interface are dependent on structure for
their major characteristics.
Jn rare cases,, the sinking of wells on
structural “highs” covering very thick
post-Triassic stratigraphical columns may
be justified, but well-locating on such
“highs” demands very careful study and
analysis of the local geological history
and a very critical examination of the
basic causes of any geophysical
anomalies noted. In general, the search
for oil in Australia must be divorced
from the mapping of post-Triassic struc-
tures, which, at best, can play only a
secondary role in this vital exploration.

“Curie”: Best laugh our small town
has had for a long time was when we
heard the amount of liquor consumed by
visiting women golfers for our Associates’
Open Championship. Forty-six women
(not all drinkers) competed and, with a

cans and four-dozen bottles of beer (it
ran out), five bottles of whisky, about
three bottles of gin, not to mention
brandy, etc., over a weekend. The
Members’ Open, with about twice the
crowd, was a feeble show in- comparison.

being a market-town in Rumania, near

population 1100-odd, it seems a queer
place to hold such a conference! So
when is this stupid fad of referring to
a ship as a place or person without the

under Certain conditions, there is a

Dearest, show me all your charms, and

Have a coke, and tell me you adore me ;

When the sun no longer shines above

To take a Puka Puka peek-a-bo!

of £lOO passing in and out of those same

what of the old traditional clean-cut

Pioneer Courage
Of Henrietta, Marooned
By BETHIA FOOTT
With the exception of
my husband’s father,
Brigadier-General C.
H. Foott, who lived
to be over 60, the men of that
family have died young.
They have made perfect and
most loving husbands, and each
has been mourned by a young
widow whose pattern of life
has almost exactly followed
that of her counterpart in the
previous generation. Left with
an increasing number of
family heirlooms and no
money, each has struggled
painfully to keep herself and
her young children by her
paint-brush or her pen —pre-
ferably by her pen, for an ink-
boltle is cheaper than a box
of paints. Indeed, it is the
cheapest tool-of-trade a crafts-
man can buy.
The first of these Australian
widows-to-be was Henrietta
Ann Foott, the daughter of
Henry Lumsden of Clova,
Aberdeenshire. She came from
a most distinguished Scottish
family whose main houses,
Clova, Pitcapie and Belhelvie,
were apt to see their masters
only after their retirement
from the Army. The most
famous of them all was Lieut.-
General Sir Harry Lumsden of
Belhelvie. He was Henrietta’s
first-cousin, and founded the
proud Regiment of the Guides,
but her brother, John Tower
Lumsden of Clova, and her
uncles and cousins Henry,
Peter, Thomas and Wiliiam
were also well known at a
time when heroism was rife in
India. The names of Lumsden,
Younghusband, Battye, Have-
lock and John Nicholson were
known and revered in every
British household of that day.
There is an anecdote still
going the rounds among the
older members of the family
about Henrietta’s brother
John. When he was leaving
Aberdeen for India, Adam
Ledingham, the gamekeeper at
Clova, walked 40 miles to say
goodbye to him.
“Noo, Johnnie, gin ye gang
to wars, mind me, and haud
the dykes.”
This he did, as General
Ewart of the 93rd High-
landers, recorded, when he
wrote of that distant, shadowy
member of my husband’s
family, who “waved his sword
high above his head, cheering
on the Highlanders, and call-
ing to them to fight for the
honor of Scotland.” But the
enemy were upon them, and
Johnnie, while trying his
hardest to “haud the dykes,”
was killed.
TTenrietta married James
Foott —whose name was
sometimes spelt, with perhaps
a too-exuberant repetition of
letters, “ffoott” —of Carriga-
cunna and Springfort, County
Cork, whose ancestor had first
come to Ireland in 1630, when
George ffoott went to live in
Dublin.
James was a very dashing
man —too dashing by half —
and, having inherited his pro-
perty, was heard frequently to
aver that a man must live as
a man, not as a mouse.
This, unfortunately, entailed
a very extravagant way of life.
His claret was marked with
his name etched into a glass
seal above the cork; his
dinner-service, painted to his
own design, with his initials
stamped in raised gold on a
shield, was sent to him from
China in a tea-clipper. The
best silver was heavily chased,
of the time of Queen Anne,
and even the new, everyday
table-silver was engraved with
his crest.
With these as a background
for many other real extrava-
gances, it is not surprising to
learn that in the late 1850’s
the time had come for him to
start living like a mouse . . .
Tames and Henrietta set
** out from Melbourne on a
bright May morning in 1860,
and drove down Bourke Street
feeling very proud (she has
recorded) of “our light express-
wagon and handsome pair of
horses, just fit for their work.
How they pranced and arched
their necks as they bounded
across the ruts, seeming to
enjoy the prospect before them
as much as the occupants of
the wagon. All was snug and
well arranged within, plenty of
blankets, a canteen containing
everything requisite for a small
party, a tent, and sundry tin
dishes and buckets.”
They travelled from Kilmore
to Deniliquin, and up to the
Murrumbidgee, where they
camped some weeks, being
afraid to travel up the Darling
River until rain had fallen to
bring grass for their horses.
Here Henrietta, who had
never cooked a meal before,
turned-out meals for her hus-
band and young family which
were, she said, delicious. The
roast-duck, perhaps, may have
been, but I cannot help feeling
that her pride in her new
culinary adventures colored
her judgment where the
cockatoo-soup and galah-stew
were concerned.
Tn August they started their
* journey up the Murray, and
across the flat, dry plain to
Wentworth, a town of “two
stores, two public-houses and
a few small wooden buildings.”
Here the light express-
wagon was reloaded with pro-
visions, and the little party
ventured along the banks of
the Darling, until, coming
down an extra-steep gully, a
wheel gave way, and crumpled
to pieces beneath the weight
of the axle. This might have
been a great disaster, but
fortunately they were lent a
dray, on which, having taken
off the other wheels, they
placed the wagon, which now
carried the children and the
baby in great state.
Henrietta, on Jenny, her
white pony, with her little dog
Vic running beside her, rode
the remaining 300 miles “very
comfortably,” riding on ahead
to survey the land and choos-
ing a suitable spot to camp
each night.
Jn October they reached
Fort Bourke station, and set
about building a homestead on
a bend of the river, where the
banks were higher than any
flood-level previously known
to the blacks who frequented
the district.
Their tarpaulin was soon
erected on strong posts, with
sheets of bark for the walls —
“forming,” she wrote with
pride, “quite a comfortable
hut. The wagon was placed
at one end of the building and
served as a most excellent bed-
stead. At the other side we
had a bark fireplace so large
and roomy that it formed a
little kitchen, warm and cosy
in the winter, and many a
pleasant hour have we spent
round that sociable fireside.”
Inside, “a table, roughly
made of red-gum, and two
forms were soon manufac-
tured. Our wagon-seats, with
their cushions, made comfort-
able sofas, and the earth floor
was covered with bags, so that
the room had quite a respect-
able appearance. Two logs of
gumtrees were hollowed out by
old Neddy, and served as wash-
tubs. The clothes I washed,
with the assistance of a black
jin, in these primitive vessels,
seemed to me as white and
clean as any from a royal
laundry.”
HThat was a hot summer.
Henrietta, while she
delighted in her new hut, could
not help .remembering (as she
wrote) “the purple heather, the
bluebells and sweet wild
thyme” of her far-off —her
very far-off —Scottish home.
There were days when the
temperature soared to 115
degrees in the shade; when

trickles into dissolution this week to the

inspired by the proximity of the election.
Although the election-campaign won’t
open officially for a couple of weeks,
most members will be hard at it from
the moment they reach their electorates.
Some have started already.

Government Department), said the
evidence had not shown that the Orange
district would suffer from retention of
the present boundaries. He could not
see how the proposed alterations would
benefit the district and he did not think
the boundaries of the city should be
extended.
The commissioner is now hearing
evidence on the Bathurst proposals ; the
Lithgow area will be dealt with last.
Mr. Dane’s report will not be made
until the whole inquiry is completed.

Equal pay the Cahill way isn’t to be so
equal after all. It’s to be equal to some-
thing, but even Cahill doesn’t seem to be
sure what. He says now that the legisla-
tion, which had been expected to be
introduced this session, “may not go
through Parliament this year,” but that
it can be expected before the State elec-
tions.
Both the Parliamentary Labor party
and the industrial wing of the party seem
to be split over interpretation. Annual
conference wished the measure on the
Government without counting the cost.
Cahill and Co. have been doing a little
figuring and don’t like what they’ve found
out.
The belief now is that a plan for
“equal pay for equal work” is being pre-
pared and will be presented to Parliament
not long before the election (latest
possible date for polling-day, mid-May,
1959). The formula hasn’t been divulged
yet, but the plan is believed to be a
face-saving compromise that will enable
Cahill to give some women pay-equality
without letting the Government and
industry in for the huge bill that full
equality as demanded by the Trades
Hall would entail.

Melburnians didn’t take long to be-
come reconciled to higher fares. On
the railways, which converted to one-
class at the same time as fares were
,revised, former first-class cars were
packed during the first days, but very
soon the passengers found it more com-
fortable to take a seat in an ex-second
than to stand in a first. On the trams,
after the first few days most passengers
gave-up paying conductors in pennies
and grumbling. But many motorists
who park on the city fringe and take a
tram to and from work still have to wait
indignantly on the footpaths while trams

Freedom-loving Mr. Khrushchev is
perturbed at the possibility of General
de Gaulle becoming a dictator. He

“Ex-ACT”: Summing-up Cabinet's
solemn study of the report of the inter-
departmental committee on the retiring-
age, Social Services Minister Roberton
said it contained little that wasn’t
already known, “or at least suspected.”
It admitted that there was no fixed rela-
tionship between age and capacity for
work, and that there was a case for
flexible application of retirement provi-
sions in both private and Government
employment. It found there was no case
for special inducements to keep older
persons at work. The Government, the
Minister said, agreed that flexibility was
in the best interests of both employers
and employees, and did not believe that
a fixed retiring-age was the only solution
to the need for consistent practices and
the elimination of arbitrary personal
judgments. So it would continue to seek
a solution that didn’t involve, on the
grounds of age alone, the compulsory
dispensing with the services of those still
able and willing to give useful service
to the community.

So you thought fares had gone up?
Well,, according to Melbourne Tram-

Wraith, Australian public - transport
authorities are charging less for their
services than 10 or 20 years ago. He
said this at a civic reception in Brisbane,
where public-transport representatives
from four States attended a week-long
conference.
Wraith claimed that his board’s
expenses had risen by 4\ times since
1939, while fares had risen only 21 times.
Referring to a “complete misunder-
standing about the position of public
transport,” he said authorities were up
against the comfort and convenience of
the point-to-point transport of the private
car. Even employees, given free trans-
port on public vehicles, preferred their
cars for transport to work. The decline
in use of public transport was a trend
which authorities did not seem to have
the capacity to arrest, but, by endeavor-
ing to maintain the highest possible
standard, patronage might be won back.

“D.”: Gaming cops, apparently tipped-
off, went to a stall at Melbourne Show,
paid two-bob for four hoops and tried
to ring the major prizes, but the hoops
were too small or deformed to circle
them. The stall-holders had been show-
ing the customers how easy it was, but
it is alleged they took care to use hoops
large enough to ring the prizes. The
cops left summonses, but if the magistrate
is asked to determine whether hoop-la
is a game of skill, he will be set a poser.
The larger the hoop, the less skill re-
quired ; the smaller the hoop, the more
art needed. Less likely defences have
succeeded in that ancient arena for the
skilled and game, the police court.

“Uramao”: The death at Stewart
Island, New Zealand, of Noeline Baker,
the naturalist, recalls an interesting
reunion in Rome. Her father, John H.
Baker, was chief surveyor in N.Z half-a-
century ago and wrote an account of his
experiences, A Surveyor in New Zealand.
As a lad he worked on Samuel Buffet's
sheep-run, known as Mesopotamia, on the
upper reaches of the Rangitata River,
and he accompanied Butler into the wiid,
weird country in the foothills of the
Southern Alps, where Butler gathered
material for Erewhon. When Baker
had retired 40 years later, he was touring
Europe with his wife and daughter
Noeline, and one night was dining in a
restaurant in Rome when Noeline called
his attention to a philosophic old man
sitting at the head of the next table. Since
the face seemed familiar, Baker
approached the old man and asked if he
had ever been in N.Z. The man replied
that he was there 40 years before. “Then
perhaps you are Samuel Butler?” Baker
ventured. “My God,” said the old man,
“you are John Baker!” They lived old
times again till late hours. Next morning
the Bakers left Rome to continue their
journey. Butler went to Sicily to work
on a book he was writing, but ill-health
overtook him and he returned to England,

He excels in his pictures of sailing-
ships. He's been round the Horn in

before the mast taught him by experience
the details of rigging, which his artistic
talent enables him to depict so faithfully.

“Piketrailer” (Bahrein) notes a re-
union:—
I see that the C.1.G.5.-designate, General
Sir Francis Festing, has been visiting Canberra
(B. 28/5/’5B). No doubt when he called on
his old boss, the Field-Marshal, the talk over
a glass of something ranged back to the jungle-
green days of Burma, for Maj.-Gen. (as he then
was) Franky Festing was G.O.C. 36th Inf. Div.
in Bill Slim's Fourteenth Army.
If any Americans were still about from Coral
Sea Week he would have been a good man to
yarn to them, too, since not the least of his
successes in Burma was an ability to get on
well with “Vinegar Joe” Stilwell. After the
Arakan campaign, 36th Div. was placed under
command of “Vinegar Joe’s” Northern Combat
Area Command in August, 1944, for the drive
south on Mandalay to link with Fourteenth
Army’s offensive from the west. As Frank
Owen puts it in The Campaign in Burma:
“General Festing stuck his head in Stilwell’s
tent and said, Testing reporting for duty, sir.
Any orders?’ To which Joe replied, without
looking-up from his map, ‘Take Taungyi!’
Festing went away and took Taungyi!”
One great advantage of 36th Div.’s rugged
advance south through teak-forest and swamp
and across flooded rivers during the monsoon
was the discovery of a railway’ running in
the right direction. There “the American
engineers fitted flanged wheels on a couple of
jeeps and set them at either end of a line of
trucks to push and pull a jeep-train. One of
the sights on this railway was to see Festing,
a six-foot-four-and-a-half-inch giant, acting as
engine-driver of his own headquarters train by
driving the fore jeep.”

he collected in 1935 for organising the
Macßobertson International Air Race.
One of the wounds Cole received at
Dieppe was in the face, and this qualified
him as a member of the Guinea Pig Club

“Sevenelms” (Yokohama): A report
that Japanese slaughtermen, with the aim
of humane killing, were tranquillising the
bullocks with sake evoked an intriguing
picture of tipsy Herefords weaving
happily towards the pole-axe wielders.
However, that vision was dispelled by
a visit to the Matsuzaka abattoirs, where
the obvious basis of the rumor was a
pen of contented oxen. Each baldy,
three times daily for one week, got one
bottle of Asahi Lager (2s. Bd.). Super-
intendent Sugahara assured us that only
by such supplementing could beef of
requisite tenderness and flavor be got for
the sukiyaki cooks ( sukiyaki is translat-
able literally as preference-grilling). The
cost of the beef is 800 yen per kilo, or

tended that, even allowing for the vast
difference between the flocks and areas
here and in his native England, the crook
could still be used with advantage.
Incidentally, he claimed that the expres-
sion “By hook or by crook” did not
mean, as is generally thought, “By fair
means or foul”; it derived from the right
conferred by William the Conqueror on
certain families dwelling in the New
Forest. They were permitted to gather

place most inner-suburban dwellers might

bomber. Based on Orange (N.S.W.), it

“Jane”: The project was to shift the
survey-camp to a new site. The surveyor
in charge commenced the day with slight
vexation of spirit when a fruitless search
established that his wallet was lost—and
it could be anywhere within a radius of
30 miles. The caravan was hooked onto
the Land Rover, and en route to the new
site an accident to drawbar and coupling
resulted in a gaping hole in the front of
the van. On the second trip, this time
with trailer, tents and equipment, one
of the tents came loose from its moorings
and was dragged over the rugged miles —
a write-off. With half-a-day to recoup

insensibility to discover the truant body

“Tabba”: The chief reason the cat
gone bush hasn’t become a pest is that
the creatures it preys on are not of direct
economic interest to farmer or grazier.
With the exception of the fox, our im-
ported pests are herbivorous and found
an almost unlimited supply of food avail-
able. The fox found himself in the same
position as the cat, with this difference
—he is big enough to attack sheep and
other small farm-livestock. It isn’t a
matter of numbers ; there are probably
more “wild” cats in Australia than there
are foxes; we have cats in hundreds
throughout the cattle-country of the
North, but no foxes. The fox is present
only where he can be a pest; that is,
in sheep-country. So it’s a matter of
size limiting opportunity ; if Puss came
a few sizes bigger the picture would be

reputation of his big cousins, in other

“Mackville”: Unless “Ceg” (B.
10/9/’5B) was trying to pull our legs,
he hasn’t had much experience with
water-tanks—of the kind likely to be
found in an outback' school, anyway.
His hobo who jumped into one on a
scorching day certainly wouldn’t need
medical attention for scalds. One of the
delightful qualities of tank-water is its
coolness, even on the hottest day.
When you can fry a chop on a sheet
of galvanised-iron laid flat on the ground
the side of a tank exposed to the same
sun will feel cool to the touch. You
can’t make a tank' really hot when it’s
filled with water. I know—l once wasted

“Why, he’s, got half-a-dozen breeds in

“Snobby”: Instinctive fears appa-
rently survive in wild goats even when
the dangers which called them into being
have long since passed. On islands off
the N.Q. coast which are now tourist-
resorts hundreds of goats have lived in
wild state since their progenitors were
liberated there over 60 years ago—the
Government of the day had an idea
they’d serve as food for any shipwrecked
mariners. The wrecks never came ; the
goats took hold and prospered. They
were free of danger, there being no
predatory animals to molest them. Yet,
whenever two goats lie down to rest they
still face in a way that gives them, as a
T’m told that an old friend in Port
Adelaide, Franklin’s pie-cart, has now
gone all-electric! For more than half-a-
century it has occupied various sites at
the Port, and it used to be a recognised
feature from which to take a directional
point—“ You know the pie-cart? Well,
you take such-and-such a line from there
. . .” Originally owned by Charles
Franklin, it is still owned by his sons.
Old Floss, the horse, used to haul the
outfit into place, but a car now does the
job; and instead of stoking-up a fire
the operator plugs into a power-point.
There was a lot of romance about the
old pie-cart, and the man who first ran
it is said to have had a medal bestowed
on him by watersiders’ womenfolk in
gratitude for his goodheartedness in
handing-out free pies to children during
difficult times. —“Croweater.”
“Zake”: “Y’ can always tell a well-
bred dorg by his manners.” said the

“Correctacus”: Though they measure
directly the Earth's rotation, sundials (B.
27/8/’5B), like other timepieces, are
truthful only after adjustment to position,
and correction. The pointer, or gnomon,
must be perpendicular to the graduated
surface it shadows, and parallel to the
Earth’s axis—an adjustment to latitude.
The dial gives solar or apparent time, so
it must be tuned to working or local
mean-time —an adjustment to longitude.
As solar time coincides with local mean-
time on only four days of the year, rang-
ing for the rest over about 15 minutes
fast or slow, there must be corrections,
usually engraved on the dial, for seasonal
variation —an equation of time. Accurate
sundials with inbuilt adjustments and
corrections are made, but the increasingly
popular ornamental garden dial can be
set to give correct time within a minute
or so. In even a garden-ornament Truth
enhances Beauty: that should be worth
the added cost.

WARRACKNABEAL (Vic.) district claims
to have Australia’s oldest working-
shearer in 78-year-old Phil Brilliant, who
can still do his 80 a day. Except when

“H.R.M.”: Know a bloke who makes
a fetish of drinking a cup of hot water
every morning to “clean his inside.” It
might ; on the other hand, it's probable
his works are as badly in need of a
de-coke as everyone else's. So 1 wasn’t
at all surprised to find that while sun-
baking he pushes clothes-psgs between
his toes “to let the air in.”

“Inglegar”: The antipathy bower-birds
have for the color red isn’t shared by
the pair of white-eared honeyeaters that
set up house in our garden. They
ignored the family cats, a tabby and a
grey; but when a neighboring ginger
tom appeared both birds nose-dived
fearlessly, and darned near plucked him
for nest-lining before he could escape.

“Bo”: If there is a more useful piece
of impedimenta around the rnulga than
the sugar-bag I'd like to see it ; it has
No. 8 wire and the kero.-tin beaten
hollow. It makes a handy cap-and-cloak
on a rainy day—not as good as the corn-
sack, but still effective. Its use as a
nosebag, apron or carry-all is celebrated.
As a honey-strainer, fire-beater, tucker-
bag it isn’t to be sneezed at. Stretched
around a frame, it has made many a
workable bush-safe; filled with grass,
many a comfortable pillow. 1 have seen
it in use as a barber’s clo,th, and it has
been into service as “Prince
Alberts” in lean times. Several sewn
together make a reasonably good tent-fly,
and they’ve formed partitions in many
a pioneer’s bush humpy. Cut up, they
can do good work as wicks in slush-
lamps. They can be used as floorcloths,
doormats, temporary mail-bags, fishing-
bags and saddle-bags. I’ve seen
hammocks and bunks made of 'em.
Filled with earth, they have helped hold
back floodwaters, or been made the
foundation of many a small dam. They
can even be used for holding sugar.

“H.C.8.”: Debate here on timber-
seasoning has led right up to the focal
point, then shied off it. That point is
known technically as “equilibrium
moisture-content,” meaning that timber
is correctly seasoned when its moisture-
content is the same as that in the
atmosphere surrounding it. Timber kiln-
dried below that point will swell when
exposed to normal atmospheric condi-
tions ; if moisture above it remains after
the seasoning-process the timber will
shrink. The opening-up of a table-top
at a joint during a long dry spell is
neither a condemnation nor recommen-
dation for either the old-fashioned rack-
“What about adjourning th' summit conference and doin' a bit of Work ?”
seasoning or the modern kiln-drying—
the same thing could have happened
regardless. Seasoned timber has to
reseason itself when such drastic climatic
changes take place.

“Myall”: Polythene-plastic sheeting
has been used for the first time in
Queensland in making a dam on a Vic-
toria Point farm, about 27 miles south
from Brisbane. The soil on the property
is so porous it won’t hold water, so a
dam, with a capacity of 30,000 gals.,
was excavated and lined with the plastic,
which has a thickness of only 1/4000th
of an inch. The sheet measures 78ft.
by 29ft., and the weight of water it
contains is estimated at 130 tons. The
manufacturers of the plastic claim that
it will last indefinitely provided it isn’t
punctured. Total cost of the dam was
a iittle under £lOO. To date results have
been wholly satisfactory.

“Mugga Way”: Still making rain by
experiments when suitable clouds are
about, the C.5.1.R.0. boys are now trying
to reduce the amount of chemicals needed.
With silver-iodide costing £lO a pound,
the idea seems right, and the new type
of burner, tested successfully at Amberley
(Q.), may prove a further answer in
the fight against drought.

Tnclude among other lost goldmines
one in West Queensland.
Early this century an old abo.
boundary-rider used to go walkabout
every wet-season, after sending his gin
to the blacks’-camp. No one took any
notice of him: he'd be back again after
the wet-season was finished. He did
that consistently for six years. When
he died he had 1200oz. of gold in the
bank in Cloncurry.
There was no mad rush—there weren’t
enough men in that country to form a
rush, anyway. But there was some quiet
probing. They questioned his old gin.
She knew nothing—and no one can be
more dumb than an elderly gin if she
doesn’t want to talk.
Men started to put two and two
together: the boundary-rider fossicked
only during the wet-season ; the creeks
were running ; it was washed gold . . .
Where?
In the ranges out that way there
are innumerable gullies stretching over
about 10,000 square-miles of country.
At least one man has died and a good
deal of money has been lost by grub-
staking in fruitless search.

U.S. LEAD-ZINC QUOTAS
r T' H E U.S. Government's
- 1 decision to restrict lead
and zinc imports wasn't entirely
unexpected, but the severity of
the restrictions, as they apply
to Australian producers, is a
serious blow to the mining-
concerns and -communities
directly affected, as well as to
whatever chances Australia
may have had of narrowing the
dollar-gap and improving our
budgeted export-income.
To relieve “distress” in the
U.S. lead and zinc industries,
U.S. imports of these metals
are to be limited to 80 p.c. of
the annual average for the
period 1953-57. However, as
Australian lead-zinc exports to
U.S. have risen sharply over the
last few years, the cut, in terms
of last year's exports of lead-
concentrates, works out at
around 49 p.c., and the total
cost in lost export-income at
something like 18-million
dollars. The restrictions, in the
form of import-quotas, come
into force today (October 1).
Already troubled by sagging
prices, the “big-four” Barrier
mines cut working-time by 10
p.c. early this year, and some
reduction in both the volume
and value of lead-zinc output
was, in any case, expected.
Nevertheless, unless alternative
outlets can be secured, such as
those in Asia, suggested last
week, further attempts to
minimise actual retrenchments
at the Broken Hill mines, may
prove difficult, with world-
markets dull and prices, barely,
if at all, profitable. The
Queensland copper-lead-zinc
producer, Mt. Isa Mines, Ltd.,
isn't directly concerned, as its
output goes to the U.K. and
Europe and, although Euro-
pean prices may well w'eaken,
no interruption is anticipated in
the co.’s expansion programme.
Repercussions from any
reduction in output and
employment at Broken Hill are
not to be measured only in
terms of export-earnings ; the
full cost to the economy would
be difficult to estimate. At the
same time, if the immediate
outlook for Australia’s external
trade were a little more
encouraging, published com-
ments on the U.S.. decision
might have been somewhat
more restrained. The probable
loss of export-income, for
instance, is on a far lower scale
than the £ 145-million drop in
the wool-cheque last year and
“Fellow-directors! We have eliminated our labor-force
with automation and our office-staff with electronic
computors. I’m afraid our next move will have to he right
here in the board-room .”
the general decline in U.S. pur-
chases of Australian wool.
These comparisons are, of
course, cold comfort, but they
do help to give a little per-
spective to the situation.
Highlighting the present-day
difficulties of base-metal con-
cerns, Broken Hill South, Ltd.,
reported a 70 p.c. fall in net
earnings last week. Thanks to
South's big investment port-
folio and realisation of metal
produced in 1956-57, the co.
was able to show a net profit of
£611,085 (£1,969,430 in 1957).
North Broken Hill, Ltd., then
weighed-in with net profit down
£1,607,069 at £512,827, mining
operations showing a loss of
£111,398. South’s div. was
slashed from Bs. 6d. to 3s. 6d.
and North’s from 10s. to
4s. 6d. a ss. share.
The Bank Stakes
[l'rom London]
Tsritish banks have been
shackled, in one way or
another, for almost 20 years.
So their joyous and, it must
be said, less than usually digni-
fied whoops and bounds of
freedom are understandable.
First there was the scramble
to link-up with the h.-p.
finance-houses, and then, hard
after, the Midland Bank's sen-
sational pronouncement that it
would grant personal loans of
up to £5OO to its customers,
thus apparently setting-up in
competition with the h.-p. con-
cerns and, therefore, indirectly
with itself.
What is the significance of
this new order? Simply to
recognise that hire-purchase,
for some time respectable if
hardly U, is now to be con-
sidered normal. The new type
of unsecured loan, to be
granted on status only, is
intended for the middle-class
customer, and also, in the
longer view, to attract the
opening of accounts by wage-
earners.
A study of the background
suggests that the recent moves
were inspired by the Bank of
England with, no doubt, the
connivance of the Government.
In general, they are for the
better.
One lesson that the Treasury
must have learned is that
rigid economic control can
give rise to a “grey”-market in
credit just as surely as control
of more tangible commodities
can give rise to a blackmarket
in goods. Directives, to banks,
restraining their normal and
proper function as lending-
authorities, have not prevented
the raising of money from
other sources. The refusal of
the Capital Issues Committee
to allow the big h.*-p. finance-
houses to expand only resulted
in the mushroom-formation of
over 1000 small concerns.
These were able to offer up to
10 per cent, on deposits from
the public, with the result that
the cost to the customer of his
“easy payments” was fantastic
—the prevailing h.-p. charge on
bicycles was 224 p.c. (40 p.c.
effective) and even higher ; on
cars, where collection of pay-
ments is less complicated, the
lowest general charge was 8
p.c. (15 p.c. effective).
The Midland Bank scheme,
quickly imitated by others,
allows for a stated 5 p.c.
(equivalent to 94 p.c. effective),
includes free life-insurance for
the loan outstanding on death,
and the interest, unlike that
under h.-p. contracts, will rank
for income-tax rebate. Its
effect was to cause an imme-
diate and apparently desperate
slashing of interest-rates on the
part of bankers and
retailers. Moreover, the pub-
licity has made the public rate-
conscious.
There may be prudence as
well as virtue in saving for a
luxury before you buy it, and
“keeping up with the Joneses”
is hardly a recipe for the full
life, but such social implica-
tions as these are hardly
relevant to the situation.
Human-nature prevails. People
are either savers or they are
not. Most are not, but,
against this, experience shows
that they honor their h.-p.
commitments.
The banks, of course, are

delighted, but their enthusiasm
is largely psychological. There
are going to be many, many
disappointed clients. Those,
for example, who are given to
living right up to their incomes
have self-revealing ledgers and
will be politely turned away.
In any event, it is unlikely that
unlimited money will imme-
diately be available for loans,
unsecured or otherwise. One
learns, in fact, that bank-
managers are tending to per-
suade their clients to make- use
of the old-fashioned overdraft.
Midland Bank has certainly
made the most of the wide
publicity, and has crashed into
the news again with “personal
cheque-accounts” (cheques at
6d. a time, including prepaid
charges, but no other facilities).
Yet two of the Big Five —
Lloyds and National Provincial
—are holding themselves aloof
from the scamper, preferring
to meet their clients’ needs “as
generously as is consistent with
banking principles.”
In sum, the new arrange-
ment is not so much a com-
petitor to h.-p. as a comple-
ment to it. The entry of the
banks into this field regularises
the industry and must have a
salutary effect (the mushroom
concerns will probably wind-
up or merge). What little fillip
it might give to home trade
will be welcomed, for a modest
expansion is called for and
there is a deflationary element
in the reduction in interest-
rates. Finally, with the “Big
Five” and “Little Six” banks
as sleeping and active partners
in h.-p. finance the Govern-
ment has, through the central
bank, a. ready and flexible
means of loosening or tighten-
ing credit.

The Petroleum Industry
[From ]L. Owen]
Through a series ot house-
magazines, technical bul-
letins, digests and pamphlets,
Australia, on the whole, has
been well supplied with infor-
mation as to the local ramifica-
tions of the oil business. This
information has been made
available, without cost, to
interested persons.
From the student’s point of
view, it is to be deplored that
most treatises on the petroleum
industry usually cover only a
specialised section. It becomes
difficult, therefore, to acquire
a book-knowledge which
embraces a general panorama
of the many interconnected
sections from the discovery of
crude oil to the most efficient
use of the finished products.
Encyclopaedic works such
as The Science of Petroleum,
which took 10 years to prepare
and print—-tend to become
obsolescent shortly after they
are available to the public, and
any attempt to keep abreast of
the rapid development in all
sections of the oil game by
reading specialist . literature
fails through lack of time.
Even for the layman, there
are very few books on petro-
leum which are, at the one
time, readable, comprehensive
and accurate, and the third
edition of Our Industry, which
has recently arrived in Aus-
tralia, meets*a very real need.
This work, printed for private
circulation amongst members
of the staff of the British
Petroleum Co., has been issued
with the object of giving each
employee an appreciation of
all the operations that go on
within an integrated oil-com-

It is a pity that this book
isn’t on sale, but the company
is holding back a few copies,
at its Sydney head-office, for
loan to interested persons,
without charge.
The present edition is a sub-
stantial volume of 472 pages
of letterpress, illustrated by 87
plates of well-chosen photo-
graphs and maps and 62 text
figures. The volume is divided
into 22 chapters whose titles
give an indication of its wide
scope:
“The growth of the petroleum
industry”'; “Exploration”; “Drill-
ing"; “Production”; “Crude oil,
its nature and distillation”; “Refin-
ing processes”; “A modem
refinery”; “Pipelines”; “Tankers” ;
“Distribution”; “Engine fuels”;
“H eating and fuel oil”;
“Natural and liquefied petroleum
gases”; “Lubrication and lubri-
cants” ; “Other petroleum pro-
ducts” ; • “Petroleum chemicals” ;
“The measurement and testing ot
oil”; “Oil and world energy”;
‘The oil-producing areas of the
world”; “Research in the indus-
try"; “The structure of the
industry”; and “The British
Petroleum Co., Ltd.”
In addition, there is a com-
prehensive glossary of the
terms in use by oilmen, a very
useful section on statistics and
data, a bibliography (rightly
restricted to up-to-date publi-
cations) and an eight-page
index.
The simplification of highly
technical material is always a
difficult and sometimes a
dangerous undertaking, but the
35 contributing experts have
successfully carried out their
task without making mislead-
ing or erroneous translations.
My only quibbles are on con-
troversial matters, such as the
length of time required for the
conversion of organic matter
into crude petroleum.
For those who wish to learn
only about special sections,
B.P. has recently issued pam-
phlets entitled The Search for

Royal Ballet
It’s worth repeating the
opinion noted here a couple of
weeks ago about this ballet
company at Sydney Empire—■
easily the best to visit these
parts since the Monte Carlo
and De Basil’s Ballet Russe,
and possibly better than those
outstanding companies.
That opinion, based on a
couple of programmes, was
more than supported by a sub-
sequent “Giselle,” and then by
a fourth programme which in-
cluded a repeat of an exquisite
“Sylphides,” the flash and
glitter of the “Don Quixote”
pas de deux, the charming
elegance of “Blue Rose,” the
moody, oppressive drama of
“The Burrow,” and a sparkling
“Fapade”—although the com-
pany’s performance of the last
bright item did nothing to dim
the memory of the Boro-
vansky’s version.
Then, having shown how
good it was, the company came
to light last Saturday night
with a “Swan Lake” that was
quite magnificent in every way
—in fact, anyone who sees a
better performance, or better
dancing than that of Svetlana
Beriosova, will be very fortu-
nate indeed. Even before her
appearance, however, the per-
formance had established it-
self as something out of the
ordinary. Bryan Ashbridge's
gracefully expressive Siegfried,
Lorna Mossford’s beautifully
articulate hands, the superb
“Stop me if you've heard this one!”
dancing of Donald Mac Leary,
Donald Britton and Noreen
Sopwith these and other
dancers, together with cos-
tumes, setting and production
in general, had already
generated an atmosphere of
excitement before Beriosova
appeared in the second act.
When she did appear she
electrified the house. Her
dancing was strong, fine and
faultless, and so emotionally
charged with tenderness and
tragedy that when she went off,
the audience, which usually
claps everything, remained as
though in a trance and forgot
to applaud.
That was the least it could
have done for dancing of such
classic purity and which some-
how combined imperiousness,
poignancy and gentle fluttering
timidity. Then, having set her
Odette on such a perfect note
that one wondered how on
earth she would dance Odille,
the dancer returned as a
bewitchingly evil black fairy
and once more fascinated the
audience as readily as she did
the unfortunate Siegfried. As
though inspired by her danc-
ing, the whole company seemed
to excel itself in this third act,
and, what with the blaze of rich
costumes and setting, the
brilliant featured dances and
the spectacular smoking con-
fusion as old Rothbart brought-
off his hocus-pocus, the curtain
came down on an act of boil-
ing dramatic excitement.
Then the last act with
Beriosova white, beautiful and
tragic and taking the story so
perfectly to its conclusion that
the audience applauded long,
long after the curtain, and
possibly, like this commentator,
is applauding still.

Kubelik and Goodman
Isador Goodman, soloist in
Rachmaninoff’s Second Piano
Concerto with the Sydney
Symphony Orchestra under
Raphael Kubelik, brought a
fine-spun tone to the lush slow
episodes of this beguilingly
melodious work, and, in those
parts of the opening and clos-
ing allegros where strong play-
ing in octaves and fast runs
and trilling are called for, his
accurate nimbleness gave solid
backing to a neat fitting of the
complicated keyboard pattern
into the general design.
The symphony was Beet-
hoven’s Third, the “Eroica,”
and Kubelik, as virile a con-
ductor as ever trod a podium,
worked like a fury in three of
its four movements to wring-
out the last vestige of its heroic
and epic qualities. In the
other movement, the great
Funeral March, the solemn
grandeur was not fully
captured.
The conductor, always most
volatile when piloting a work
by a compatriot, shook out his
mane and propounded the
case for the beauties of his
native Bohemia in a forceful
performance of “Blatnik,” the
last of the six tone-poems by
Smetana grouped under the
the title “Ma Vlast.”

D Major Sonata by the 18th-

pupil of Corelli. A transcrip-
tion by Piatti from the original
violin-and-harpsichord combi-
nation, it drew upon coruscat-
ing fireworks which were
thrown into greater relief by
the stately slow movement.
Another notable piece of
near-perfect lyrical playing

“A Child of Our Time”
Professor Donald Peart and
the Pro Musica Society cele-
brated the 10th anniversary of
the founding of Sydney Uni-
versity’s music department with
a first performance in Australia
of Michael Tippett’s oratorio.
This searing work, written in
1941 to the composer’s own
text, is based upon Nazi ex-
cesses against the Jews in 1938,
following the assassination in
Paris of a German diplomat by
a Jewish boy. It is at once a
philosophical treatise on
tyranny and a strong and
passionate protest.
The orchestral writing,
despite some too-thick com-
plexities, generally gives plenty
of life to a text of admirable
clarity. The music allotted the
choir is vital and often ex-
plosive in its wrath and exas-
perations ; that for the four
solo voices carries a deal of
compassion and tenderness,
especially for the soprano and
contralto. Some of the material
is “ungrateful” for the tenor,
especially where he has to sing
against the orchestra.
The baritone’s role of
narrator was at the easy
command of Geoffrey Chard,
who gave it a forthright
strength and fine resonance.
Nerissa Niblo sang the soprano
part with style and assurance,
being especially effective in
the softer episodes. Roberta
Frost’s contralto was more
secure in the low than the high
register, and Archie Hamilton’s
tenor stood up reasonably well
to some difficult pages, and he
achieved some good ringing
high notes.
The choir only rarely suc-
ceeded in getting weight and
quality combined to do full
justice to choruses for which
the dramatic impact was vital ;
and balance was often faulty.
Professor Peart, whose adven-
turousness in presenting new
English works of merit is
wholly admirable, worked-over
his orchestral forces with a
zeal and skill which deserved a
much better response.

“This is Cinerama”
Cinerama is the name given
to the newest technical advance
—and it is a big one —in
movie-making. It involves the
use of a screen 75ft. long
curved to 146 deg.—about.—about the
same compass as the human
eye—and three projectors. The
three-lensed camera simul-
taneously takes three pictures,
each projector throwing the
image onto its section of the
screen in precise synchronisa-
tion. An ingenious multi-
channelled speaker-system is
operated by six soundtracks.
The total effect is one of very
wide vision and, where neces-
sary, plenty of sound emanat-
ing from where it should.
The main imperfection is
slight distortion on the vertical
line where each of the screen’s
three sections meet. The film
is also inclined to “dance”
occasionally, though this is
probably a temporary opera-
tional defect,
The medium is particularly
suited for the wide panoramic
sweep; the audience gets right
into the picture, as it were,
You are whisked aloft in a
helicopter to circumnavigate
Niagara Falls—a magnificent
shot; you sweep low over the
great wheatlands of the U.S. in
a fast plane, and fly between

“The Quiet American”
Set j n Indo-China just before
French authority began to
fold-up, this screen-play of the
Graham Greene novel was
written and directed by Joseph
Mankiewicz, who has achieved
good atmosphere and charac-
terisation, a smooth flow to the
drama, and particularly effec-
tive crowd-scenes.
Michael Redgrave stands
out as the cynical, world-weary
war - correspondent who is
determined to report the Com-
munist rebellion objectively,
but who is eventually driven
by jealousy—and fear that his
younger rival will swipe his
native mistress —into abandon-
ing his neutral attitude and
giving oblique aid to the Reds
in removing the American
whose death has become vital
to them.
Audie Murphy’s frank,
boyish face and manner suit
the role of the ingenuous
American • whom trouble
follows like a plague ; Claude
Dauphin sketches-in a neat
vignette as the patient and
humane French police-chief
who sifts the circumstances of
the American’s death; and
Giorgia Moll is adequate as
the girl whose change of loyal-
ties triggers-off the tragedy.

“Let’s Be Happy”
A shade better than most
British musicals, but still a long
way behind Hollywood’s best,
this one has singer Tony Martin
and dancer Vera-Ellen as a
couple of Yanks who meet on
a Europe-bound plane, he a
businessman, she a small-town
miss who is going to Scotland
to bust-up a small inheritance
in a look around the land of
her forebears.
They meet again, in Edin-
burgh at • Festival time. A
wrong impress on gained by a
near-broke Scottish lord that
the lady has an enormous
fortune sparks-off a tepid
romance, but there is never
any doubt that her compatriot
will be the winner at the final
fade-out.
Vera-Ellen flings a neat hoof,
and Martin exudes his usual
soulfulness as he yawps. The
director has really gone to
town in the slap-up sets in a
posh Edinburgh pub.

“The Flesh Is Weak”
The audience is asked to
believe that the girl in this
story —about racketeers who
exploit the prostitutes of Lon-
don’s West End —is so dumb
that she doesn't know what’s
going on when she is installed
in a “house” after falling for
the smooth blandishments of
the handsome stranger who is
the gang’s No. 1 bait for pros-
pective street-walkers. The rest
of the lurid plot is so con-
cerned with warning too-
trusting girls that it ignores
such trifling things as logic or
the clear sequence of events.

The WILD CAL
COLUMN
Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney
Asa counterbalance to the sharp reduc-
tion in rural incomes and deposits
during the second half of 1957-58, accom-
panied by a general easing of inflationary
pressures, the central bank gave the
trading-banks’ lending policies a mild
stimulant from February onward by four
successive releases from the special
accounts, to a total of £65 million for
the financial year.
With its share of the releases and by
running-down its holdings of liquids and
securities, the Commercial of Sydney was
able to reshuffle its portfolio and step-up
its advances, although £11,414,525 was
chipped off total assets (parent’s
accounts).
The resulting gains, together with those
from a greatly increased activity on the
part of the savings-bank offshoot, now
in its third year of operations, was
responsible for an appreciable rise of
£83,000 in consolidated earnings, after
providing for taxation and other
contingencies:—•

During the year the wholly-owned sav-
ings subsidiary opened 41,000 new
accounts for depositors, to a total of
108,000, and depositors’ balances, bills
payable and other liabilities rose by
£8,719,000 to £25,613,000. Profit from
this sector for the year ended June 30,
1958, amounted to £69,992, compared
with £31,657 for the lly months’ trading
period to June 30, 1957.
The last of the private banks to enter
the hire-purchase field, C.B.C. earlier this
year promoted a new public company
under the style of Commercial and
General Acceptance, Ltd., which, how-
ever, opened its account too late to
influence the term’s results.
(The other partnerships are the ’Wales
and Australian Guarantee Corporation ;
the National and Custom Credit Corpora-
tion ; the A.N.Z. and Industrial Accept-
ance ; the E., S. and A. and Esanda ; the
C.B.A. and General Credits; and the
Adelaide and the Finance Corporation
of Australia.)
Initially the affiliate issued 5,000,000
shares of 55., each paid to 2s. 6d., of
which the C.B.C. took-up its fixed entitle-
ment of 40 p.c. Last June, the Commer-
cial and General acquired the entire
issued capital, £250,000, of Terms and
Credits Pty., Ltd., previously wholly-
owned by W. R. Carpenter and Co., Ltd.,
the big island trader. Consideration for
the deal was 1,600,000 of C. and G.’s
ords., each paid to 2s. 6d., plus £150,000
in cash, and the bank maintained its
40 p.c. interest by taking-up 640,000
shares paid to the same amount, giving
it a £330,000 equity in its protege at
balance-date.
Since then Commercial and General
has taken over a Melbourne financier,
Economic Holdings, Ltd., whose share-
holders exchanged their 1,000,000 fully-
paid 10s. shares for 4,000,000 shares in
C. and G. paid to 2s. 6d. each. The
C.B.C. proposed to maintain its 40 p.c.
holding by buying 400,000 of the shares
in Economic Holdings, which was for-
merly a close affiliate of the Myer
Emporium, Ltd.
Commercial and General will have the
use of C.B.C. facilities wherever required,
and, with its ready-made contacts,
should be a profit-winning proposition
from the very outset. Its directorate
includes Sir Edward R. Knox, who is
also chairman of the bank, R. J. Vicars,
C. H. Locke, Sir Norman Nock and
B. J. D. Page. Now listed, the scrip
was recently selling around 65.? 9d.
Latterly it was announced that
the C.B.C. was to enter the unit-trust
field by acting, with the Bank of
Adelaide, as agent for the sale of units
for the Australian Fixed Trusts group,
biggest of its kind in the Commonwealth.
All but two of the seven private banks
now have unit-trust link-ups, but to date
only the N.S.W. and the E., S. and A.
have made direct investments.
Soon after its h.-p. move, the C.B.C.
surprised the sharemarket with an offer
last March of a one-for-five new issue
at par to its shareholders. Paid capital
will stand at £7,200,000 after allocation
of the whole of the issue, the added
funds, £1,200,000, easily covering the
bank’s new investments. As with other
shares, the 96,000 £25 equities were called
to £l2 10s., with the remaining
liability callable only in the event of
liquidation:

The amount raised by the new issue
was the same as in 1954, when the ratio
was one-for-four.
Accounts for the parent show that
deposits, bills payable, etc., declined by
£13,675,000 to £185,836,447, reflecting
mainly the decline in farm incomes, and
the drawing, on reserves by rural cus-
tomers. To meet the decline, liquid and
quasi-liquid assets were run-down by
£17,044,187, treasury-bills falling by
£4,850,000 and other Government securi-
ties by £8,989,000, and the liquidity-ratio
consequently slipped from 35.9 p.c. to
28.8 p.c., excluding the special accounts
(down £8,800,000).
_ On the other hand, loans, advances and
bills discounted were written £13,175,000
higher at £114,190,754, the largest total
ever recorded by the bank, taking the
ratio of advances to deposits from 50.5
p.c. to 61.5 p.c.
The building of modern premises and
the remodelling of existing branches was
responsible for an increase of £814,000
in the freeholds-account, after appro-
priating £75,000 from profit and loss in
the reduction of bank premises.
At £2l 4s. the shares offer a yield of
£5 6s. 2d. p.c. from a distribution-rate
of 9 p.c., maintained for the third succes-
sive year, and, from all appearances,
maintainable on the higher capital. Net
tangibles on consolidated accounts are a
visible £24 6s. lOd. a share, on the basis
of a paid-up capital of £7,200,000.
Mercantile Mutual Insurance Co.
r T''HE sharemarket has long been prepared
to pay a substantial premium for
scrip in soundly-established and pro-
gressive insurance offices, such as the
80-year-old Mercantile Mutual, and the
optimistic note at present prevailing in
the market has, so far, brought little
variation in the yields obtainable from
this class of investment.
The attractiveness, as a holding proposi-
tion, of scrip in leading accident offices
springs, partly, from the policy of profit-
allocation adopted by these concerns. As
a general rule, the underwriting surplus,
or the bulk of it, remains in the business,
the shareholders’ cut of the profits being
largely governed by the net return from
investments. This leaves underwriting
profits to protect policyholders and share-
holders against effects of the inevitable
fluctuations in underwriting experience,
while the accumulation of reserves
(represented by investments) helps to
swell investment earnings.
Although net premium income of the
Mercantile Mutual has almost doubled
over the last five years, last term’s under-
writing surplus was only 9.5 p.c. higher
than that recorded in 1953, an expanding
investment portfolio and the increasing
emphasis, in investment, on shares,
debentures, etc., accounting for a large
part of the 51.8 p.c. addition to net
profit over that period.
The Sydney - registered Mercantile
Mutual writes fire- and accident-business
in all Australian States and handles
marine risks through a world-wide chain
of agents. Branch-representation has
been greatly increased over the past
decade, and the co. now has over 40
Australian branches (34 in the eastern
States) compared with eight at the end
of the 1948 term.
Portion of the funds needed for this
branch-expansion came from a one-for-
one issue, at a 50 p.c. premium, in 1951,

the £250,000 of premiums collected at
the time being handed back as bonus
scrip (one-for-four) early last term. The
overall increase, from £500,000 to
£1,250,000, in the all-ord. paid capital
was accomplished without any reduction
in the div.-rate, which, with the exception
of a 2\ p.c. jubilee-bonus in 1953, has
remained steady at \2\ p.c. since 1949.
Gross premium income rose by
approximately £727,000 over the year to
June 30 last, bringing the gain in two
years to over £1 million, reinsurances
leaving net premiums £469,546 higher at
£3,147,961. All classes of premium-
revenue contributed to the improvement.
Motor-vehicle, third-party and workers’-
compensation claims continued at a high
level, while bushfires in N.S.W. and other
States added to losses, but, in the final
analysis, net premiums increased at a
faster pace than losses, the loss-rate
slipping by Bs. p.c. to 53.8 p.c. of net
premiums:

Premium income also outstripped the
growth in expenses (including taxation
on underwriting profit) and, at 33.9 p.c.
(down 525. p.c.), the expense-rate was one
of the lowest ever recorded by the co.
The greater volume of business required
a substantial increase in the provision
for unexpired risks, the £225,000 (up
£125,000) transferred to this account
limiting the improvement in the under-
writing surplus, £158,334, to £12,479.
Up £28,079 at £168,104, the net return
from investments easily covered the
bigger dividend (and was sufficient to
cover a full year’s 12| p.c. on the larger
capital, with £2084 to spare), net profit
from all sources advancing by £40,558
to £326,438:

underwriting surplus 12.7 p.c.) on the
bonus-enlarged capital, as against the
28.5 p.c. and 26.6 p.c., on a £l-million

respectively.
In the accounts at below face-value,
Government securities remain the largest

reserve for unexpired risks stood at
£1,385,000 at balance date, total reserves,
£2,907,883, exceeding paid capital by
£1,657,883 and last year’s losses and
expenses, combined, by £143,256.
Much of the new business written last
term is attributed, by the board, to the
growing branch-strength, and the co.’s
expansion in this direction is expected
to continue. On present indications,
however, it would appear that internal
funds are adequate to meet capital-
outlay, on a moderate scale, and, allow-
ing for last year’s bonus hand-out, share-
holders may need to be patient for a
few years before expecting any improve-
ment in their lot.
Book-values give each f.-p. £1 ord. a

tion at 61s. 6d.
Carrier Air Conditioning
'T'he virtual two-for-three bonus in-
volved in the recent reconstruction
of Carrier Air Conditioning and the
trebling of paid capital by par issues
over the past four years doesn’t appear
to have exhausted the investment-appeal
of Carrier scrip, latest accounts from
the co. revealing a spectacular 133 p.c.
leap in net profit.
Nevertheless, the record earnings must
be viewed in the light of the co.’s
accounting policy, under which no profit
is taken into account on any contract
until that contract is fully completed.
As Carrier finalised a number of large
jobs last term, profits from work actually
done in previous years helped to fatten
the term’s figures, this fact being
emphasised by a £159,906 slip (to
£129,943) in the balance-sheet item
“claims in excess of cost of work-in-
progress.” If anything, the procedure
followed by the co. enhances rather than
detracts from the impressive performance
put-up over the last few years, but it
does leave declared earnings susceptible
to variations in the magnitude of the
contracts undertaken.
Registered last May, Carrier Air Con-
ditioning (Holdings), Ltd., assumed the
role of holding co. for the 26-year-old
Carrier organisation early in the current
term, shareholders in the operating con-
cern, Carrier Air Conditioning, Ltd.,
receiving 20 f.-p. ss. ords. in the new
parent for every three £1 ords. held in
the older co. Par issues in 1955 (one-for-
two) and 1956 (one-for-one) raised the
operating co.’s equity capital from
£175,000 to £535,000 (the £50,000 of
5y p.c. prefs. was converted into 7 p.c.
notes in 1955), so that Carrier Air Con-
ditioning (Holdings) kicked-off with a
paid capital of £891,665.
The board expects to maintain the
p.c. div.-rate, introduced in 1955,
on the higher capital, and last term’s
final div. was calculated on this basis,
making the total distribution for the year
worth \l\ p.c. on scrip held prior to
formation of the holding co. Over a
full year the 12y p.c. distribution would
equal 20.8 p.c. on the old scrip, compared
with an average div.-rate of 9.8 p.c. over
the 10 years to 1957.
Carrier’s main production-centre is at
Seven Hills, near Sydney, with branch-
factories in Queensland, Victoria and
South Australia assisting the co. to serve
markets in all States and New Guinea.
Orders received at the height of the
commercial-building boom helped to
boost production last term (to June 30)
and there was a further increase in the
output from the recently enlarged and
relatively new plant at Seven Hills. The
value of contracts completed during the
year jumped by £927,663 to £2,350,641,
or over 10 times the value of work com-
pleted in the 1950 term, the percentage
of this record figure claimed as net
profit rising from 7.4 p.c. to 10.4 p.c.
Net earnings, written after providing
£173,000 (up £93,000) for taxation and
£33,448 (up £6086) for depreciation,
soared to £246,185—£140,618 above the
previous term’s effort —to represent 46
p.c. on paid capital, compared with 29.2
p.c. in 1957 and 31 p.c. in 1956:

a ratio well able to support a
124 p.c. div.-rate. In view of
the large increase in “com-

special £50,000 provision for
contingencies, this sum being
charged against earnings in the
published accounts.
Better-than-expected results
in the 1957 term, along the
influx of fresh capital, left the
co. with liquid funds in excess
of requirements, and holders of
the 7 p.c. notes, due for
repayment in 1960, were invited
to redeem their holdings. This
invitation still stands, but, by

The growing use of air-
conditioning equipment has
brought several new com-
petitors into the field, and, with
the boom in commercial build-
ing apparently past its peak,
as far as Sydney and Mel-
bourne are concerned, fierce
competition and a consequent
slip in profit-margins can be
expected in the current year.
Orders in hand at June 30 last
were below those* held at the
commencement of the term,
and it would seem over-
optimistic to expect expansion
to continue (in terms of com-
pleted sales) on anything like
the scale achieved last year.
However, the Carrier organisa-
tion is in a sound position,
financially and technically, to
meet this situation, and its
plans for lifting output include
the establishment of a separate
division to handle the range
of “packaged” air-conditioners
used in smaller commercial
buildings and in residential
premises.

Bruce Pie Industries Ltd.
TX/’ith an exceptionally warm
autumn and winter
hampering sales of knitted
outerwear, and the slump in
wool prices eroding stock-
values, the Queensland knitter
and spinner, Bruce Pie Indus-
tries, Ltd., was unab'e to
squeeze anything more than a
nominal profit out of its trading
activities last term. Share-
holders, who have never
received anything exciting in
the way of divs., missed-out
entirely, for the first time since
the co. was formed in 1946.
Bruce Pie Industries’ big
worsted-spinning and knitting
mill at Kedron, near Brisbane,
supplies customers in all Aus-
tralian States, but most of the
co.’s output is sold in Queens-
land, where, for many years,
retailers were almost completely
dependent on inter-State manu-
facturers. A number of rela-
tively small manufacturing-
units turn-out inner-spring
mattresses and quilts, together
with wire-spring sections and
padding, etc., for use in the
upholstery-trade.
Setting-off with a paid
capital of £300,000, of which
£59,073 represented scrip ex-
changed for the share-capitals
of two existing concerns, Bruce
Pie Industries raised a further
£150,000, at par, in 1949 to
finance extensions to the then
newly-completed Kedron mill.
A subsequent offering, one-for-
two at par, in 1951, lifted the
one-class capital to £675,000.

Any appraisal of what Britain is doing in
building up atomic power for industry would be
incomplete without reference to her growing
export in the type of plant she is using in her
own economy.
Calls on her skills in the atomic power field
are coming from Europe and other parts of
the world.
An Italian company has an undertaking with
a British firm for the building of a nuclear power
plant of British design in Italy, to which Britain
will supply the fuel. The U.K. Atomic Energy
Authority has advised the Italian Government on
another power station to be built by tender in
Southern Italy.
Another British firm has secured two
Continental orders for reactors similar in type
to the one erected by the Australian Atomic
Energy Commission at Lucas Heights, Sydney.
One of these will be built in Denmark, the other
in West Germany, near Cologne, where I am
writing this article.
Japan also is in the market for British-type
reactors, with a view to starting construction of
the first at the beginning of 1959. India and Brazil
are among other countries reported to be interested.
Incidentally, a workable average plant—
without going into the detail of its energy output —
costs between £35-million and £4O-million.
This success in the winning of contracts
overseas stems from a doubly-wise policy.
First, Britain has been maintaining close
liaison between her Atomic Energy Authority and
related industry. More than a hundred scientists
and engineers from British industry were attached
to the Authority’s establishments at the end of
last March.
And secondly, she has offered freely to place
her experience before the International Atomic
Energy Agency, which was created last year, and
to train foreign students.
She has exchanges and dealings with forty
countries, including members of the Commonwealth
and the United States. The association with
America is significant. For in that country is being
written yet another powerful chapter in the story of
Man’s constructive use of the atom.

A hesitant wool-market, and
the fear that pay-later spend-
ing on consumer-durables will
react on clothing sales, have
caused many large retailers to
maintain the extremely care-
ful buying policies adopted
earlier this year, with a conse-
quent effect on the volume of
forward orders held by the
textile industry generally. A
significant improvement in
wool prices could alter the
situation quite rapidly, and,
although the immediate
prospect of a stimulus of this
nature isn’t particularly
encouraging, stocks are, at
least, less likely to depreciate
at a rate similar to that
encountered last term.
The f.-p. £1 ords. which sold
at 13s. in July, recently changed
hands at 9s. 9d. At June
30 last, net tangible cover

only) was 235. sd.
W.Z. Oil Search
r T~'HE Shell Oil Co., which has
•*- already spent about £1
million on the search for oil in
N.Z., will begin full-scale
drilling in Taranaki early next
year. Heavy plant will be
arriving in October. The deci-
sion follows the discovery of
possible oil-traps by seismic
parties. There are now four
companies in the search for
oil in N.Z. The Minister of
Labor, Mr. Hackett, speaking
in the House recently, said he
was confident that a strike
would be made within two or
three years.


MAORHAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY
Wellington, Sept. 23.
Th vents of the last year have
demonstrated with painful
clarity the urgent need for New r
Zealand to expand its trade
outside the traditional U.K.
market. The last fortnight has
brought news of two important
moves in that direction.
The trade treaty concluded
with Japan will, it is hoped,
assist in the consolidation and
development of a new, but
rapidly growing and potentially.
valuable, market. In 1957 N.Z.
exports to Japan earned nearly
£8 million, compared with a
little over £2.5 million the
previous year. This sharp
increase raised Japan from
tenth to sixth place among
N.Z.’s markets. Japan now
ranks third after Britain and
the United States as a pur-
chaser of N.Z. meat, seventh
as a purchaser of wool.
Earlier this year it seemed as
if this important market might
be lost because of Japan’s
balance-of-payments difficulties
and domestic farm policy. With
the signing of the treaty, these
fears are to a great extent set
at rest. No great spurt of
activity is expected immedi-
ately, but a basis is established
for gradual expansion of trade:
The treaty provides for full
most-favored-nation treatment
on a reciprocal basis. N.Z.
may compete to supply Japan's
total meat imports and can
expect to sell about 10,000 tons
a year as Japan’s biggest
foreign meat-supplier. Japanese
import-duties on meat will not
be increased for three years.
New Zealand may compete
for 90 per cent, of the total
exchange allocated for Japan's
purchases of wool each year.
Import-duties on N.Z. wool
will not be increased by Japan
before July 5, 1960, and the
Government has indicated that,
while not wanting to be
formally committed now, it is
not its present intention to
increase them after that date.
N.Z. is included as a per-
mitted source of supply for
beef-tallow, cattle-hides, calf-
skins and kip-skins on the
automatic-approval list for
foreign exchange. These items
were formerly on a fund-alloca-
tion basis which placed N.Z.
at a trading disadvantage
compared with Australia.
The Japanese Government
has agreed to maintain casein
under automatic approval for
exchange - control purposes.
N.Z. can expect to secure about
50 per cent, of this market for
the next three years. N.Z.
butter, cheese, dried skim-milk
powder, buttermilk-powder and
other dairy products agreed on
from time to time will have
full opportunity to compete on
a commercial and non-discrimi-
natory basis for the total
Japanese foreign - exchange
allocation for these products.
The Japanese Government ex-
pects the market for dairy pro-
ducts to expand.
The agreement has been
warmly welcomed by N.Z.
farmers. The manufacturers’
reaction is more reserved, but
their spokesman says the treaty
could be beneficial if it leads
to a greater and more diversi-
fied export trade and if it gives
N.Z. manufacturers access to
additional sources of raw
material.
Prime Minister Nash says he
believes the safeguard clauses
will provide ample protection
for N.Z. manufacturers. The
“And this here is the biggest jail in the free World.”
Japanese Government has
undertaken to try to avoid
damage to N.Z. industries, and
it is also provided that neces-
sary action can be taken to
avoid sudden or serious dis-
ruption of the pattern of N.Z.’s
imports. The safeguard provi-
sions are similar to those in
the Australian agreement with
Japan.
Trade with U.K.
Britain and N.Z. have
reached full agreement in
principle over the revision of
the Ottawa Pact. It is under-
stood that the preference
granted to British goods will be
reduced from 20 per cent, to
10 per cent, and, in some cases,
per cent., and that N.Z. has
retained the right of free access
to the London market for
dairy products.
The main effect of the revi-
sion will be to give N.Z.
greater bargaining power in
trade-negotiations with coun-
tries other than Britain. While
it is not expected that there
will be any discrimination
against Britain, countries which
buy N.Z. produce will be able
to compete more readily with
Britain for a share of the N.Z.
market.
Price of Beer
N.Z. bar-patrons are now
getting Bioz. of beer for
Bd. as stipulated by the price-
tribunal’s order of July 4. The
order, which followed the
doubling of beer-duty in the
recent Budget, was for several
weeks ignored by publicans,
who demanded and got —
though from many fewer
customers 9d. for about
BtOz. The pre-Budget price
was 6d. for a 9oz. glass,
reasonably full—in effect,
about 84oz. The Supreme
Court has now refused an
application made on behalf of
the L.V.A. for a writ of
certiorari quashing the tri-
bunal’s order.
The trade has appealed
against the court’s decision
and, at the same time, has
made a new application to the
price-tribunal for authority to
increase charges. It wants Bd.
for an Boz. glass, reason-
ably full (about 7|oz.), and
Is. for a 12oz. glass, reasonably
full (about llyoz.).
In the first month after the
duty was doubled, beer-pro-
duction, as indicated by
Customs returns, fell by 40 to
50 per cent. Customs officials
pointed out, however, that the
fall in output did not neces-
sarily mean a corresponding
fall in consumption ; it might
be merely a temporary reduc-
tion to test the market. The
fact remains that bars were,
and still are, noticeably less
crowded.
The manager of N.Z.
Breweries, Ltd., B. T. O'Con-
nell, said that production was
40 per cent, down in the case
of bottled-beer and 15 per cent,
down in the case of draught-
beer. Few hotels had the finan-
cial strength to withstand the
losses being met. If action
were not taken soon the whole
structure of hotels in N.Z.
would collapse, he said.
Last year 47-million gallons
of beer were sold. Of the £27
million v/hich the public paid
for it, the Government took
£lO million in beer-duty and
sales-tax. When the beer-duty
was doubled from 3s. to 6s. a
gallon it was estimated that the
public would spend an extra
£7 million in beer-duty, plus
sales-tax of 20 per cent, on it
—a total extra payment of
£8.4 million. In other words,
the Government expected the
public to spend £35 million,
of which the State would take
£lB million, or 52 per cent.
This might have worked out
if the tax had been imposed
in a time of buoyant incomes,
Mr. O’Connell said, but, with
the introduction of P.A.Y.E.,
extra petrol- and tobacco-duty
and no extra income, it would
not do so. It seemed that the
public would spend £27 million
on beer in a year, as formerly.
The Government would take
10s. 6d. in the £ instead of
7s. 6d. The licensed-trade
would be £4 million worse off,
and its output would be down
23 per cent.
In its application for
increased prices the trade
claims that the B|oz.-for-
-Bd. order made after the Bud-
get, and now in force, reduces
the gross profit on a gallon of
beer from 40.5 d. to 34.9 d. and
that the trade is thus failing
by 5.6 d. a gallon to recover
the extra beer-duty.
All this has done brewery-
shares no good. Dominion
Breweries have suffered most.
They are down to 725., which
represents a loss of 20s. 9d.
since mid-February, or 14s.
6d. since the Budget. N.Z.
Breweries were at a peak of
555. 6d. a week before the
Budget. Subsequently they fell
to 50s. After the one-for-two
scrip-issue they sold at 345.,
and now they are down to
31s. 9d.

MORNING SONG
And see these houses: angle, slope and
line :
the fans of trees lie open in the park
beyond the brilliant windows and the
sleep
of innocence abandoned in the dark.
And tentative, I watch you half-asleep,
a miracle of movement and release,
fountain, faun and tender elusive
threat to my discovered peace.
Beyond the window sings a bird,
Its carol astonishes the air
that wakes the light, the dew, the cold.
I See new signs of order everywhere.

THE PHOTOGRAPH ALBUM
Smile on them gently. These are the
family ghosts,
Who once were persons: now they are
stuck down flat.
They all were lovers of pies, puddings,
and roasts.
Not one of them ever went out without
a hat.
Rococo gardens dangling in blossomy-
loops
And canvas seas and improbable plants
in pots
Incongruously surround these stony
groups
Of maids and mashers and patriarchs and
tots.
Look how they stand at bay, how solid
and square,
Brushed and buttoned and with their
heads held high,
Hands and feet disposed with a mo t dish
care,
Stricken by the callow camera s gorgon
eye.
What of this statuesque unbending wife?
This frigid frowning father? None will
guess
That she was sprightly and lovable all
her life.
And he had a name for fervor and
friendliness.
What of this whiskered uncle, grave and
grim?
This aunt, forbiddingly braced and
booted and bodiced?
Gambling, drubbing, and drink were the
ruin of him.
She, it is said, was scandalously im-
modest.
None of it shows. Locked up in stillness,
made
As blank as waxworks and as stiff as
wood,
Their foxed and yellowing effigies, as they
fade,
Betray no sparkle of laughter or lusti-
hood.
A whirr and a click released them, years
ago,
From the chill gripe of momentary
grimaces ;
The photographer ceased his devilish
to-do ;
They sprang to life, resumed their
ordinary faces,
And took their hats, and went about
their tasks.
Until the tomb received them, six-foot
deep.
All that the instant peephole caught was
masks.
Fold them away, and leave them to their
sleep.

OCEAN
Great Powers are only good for them-
selves.
Tell me the ocean cares about my cottage
Clinging to the seashore until yesterday ;
Now, undermined, leaning on one of
those shelves
That the high tide and wind leave. I’m
in my dotage,
If I think Providence ordered it this way.
Just that great, greedy sea, eating, and
biting
More than it can eat immediately.
The stately headland will go, along
With the snarling reef. Ten waiting
whiting
Will shuffle in silver slippers ; and, greatly
Bloated by the tide, the sea will poke its
tongue
Out, over the land, satisfied to barely wet
A salt-pan for which, a foot above sea-
level, it would fret.

COLONIAL GHOSTS IN THE
ADELAIDE HILLS
The light grows yellow and is daunted
By the twisted whiteness of the image
The old gum presents against the cow-line
Of the hill. A sea-eaten sun dissolves.
Now your colonial twilight settles its
smoke
Over tin roof and sleek sun-deck
And you are at liberty to call out your
ghosts:
Out, Judith’s bullocky, black billies, and
all!
Out my great German grannie to palpate
the pump,
Its squeaking calling the long-dead kelpies
home,
Provoking the morepork to its nightly
dirge :
And the young fellows gallop the spring-
cart to town.
Sir Thomas Elder descends his rich
crank's tower,
His stout breath billowing out in front
of him.
His spy-glass a crutch for his broken
drinking-arm.
All is peaceful in the Banks of Hindley
Street.
From the Tiers the wood-splitters shout
in Crafer’s pub
Of boiled-down bullocks and eventful
stolen mares
That brought Tolmer stalking in prickled
socks.
To their dying chimneys and the edge of
the morning.
Their raddled laughter wears them out.
They sleep.
Father, like a poker, keeps erect conven-
tions
That died of scurvy in Port Misery’s mud,
Lamenting to his memory the loss of his
native tongue.
The black dimensions of this great
gallows of a gum
Hang over the hill, the plain, the urban
specks of light,
Holding its possums and ghosts without
a sigh or a rustle,
And every dead settler worth his grave
is posed
In its shadowy form. The dead cling,
dismally,
But they cling, like some shedding bark
of immortality
On a hill as obedient to time as a good
wife’s breast.
The ghost-callers grope home. They have
done their best.
S.A.
MAX HARRIS.
OASIS
The fire in our explorers out-burnt the
desert,
Beyond the sane provisos of survival
Cast them always mirage-wards, while
their rival
Bodies thrust and thirsted and were hurt.
At last then, past clip of gibber, slur of
sand,
They reached it, the silence of the one
rock-pool,
Only answer to the burning fool.
Life’s moisture at the loveless centre of
dry land.
1 have known such primitive oases,
Dignified neither by camel nor by palm,
Just slime and water for the pain we can-
not bear.
But then, the body satisfied, these places
Burn up their sweaty tenant’s draught of
calm.
O love, why were you not waiting for me
there?
s.a,
GEOFFREY DUTTON.

Age of Innocence
By NANCY CATO
On the day when the
Melbourne Cup was to
be run, Molly, the
youngest member of the
literary staff, drew the favorite
in the office sweep.
To her disgust she was sent
out, just before the race was
run, to write-up for the
“Standard” the preparations
for a monster fete in the Baptist
Union hall. And as Baptists
didn’t approve of gambling,
she thought glumly, there
would be no chance of hearing
a broadcast there.
While an enthusiastic
organiser was taking her round,
she noticed how the workmen
preparing the hall (and pre-
sumably not Baptists) began
fading away ; first the men who
were hammering at a large
wooden stall, then two painters
who had been working from a
scaffolding on the stage. As
soon as she could, she also
made her escape.
Outside, it was as if a plague
had struck the city. A few
trams still ran, but there was
scarcely a car, a van, or a
pedestrian moving in the streets.
Fruit-stalls were left unguarded,
owners had deserted their
paper-stands. Every radio- and
music-shop had an amplifier
going, and round these dense
crowds were gathered. They
were already beginning to
break-up, however; the race
was over.
Molly parked her small and
ancient car outside the
“Standard” office and dashed
up the stairs, trying without
success to take four at a time.
At the door of the reporters’
room she was greeted by loud
cheers. Her horse had won.
She put the roll of notes un-
believingly into her bag.
The usual thing was for the
winner to shout a drink for
everyone at the “Black Bull,”
but they let her off because
she was a girl.
“You’ll have to celebrate,
though. What about coming-
up to the Strath, for a drink?”
said a voice behind* her.
Molly disengaged herself
from her friend Roma’s con-
gratulatory embrace and
turned, while her cheeks grew
pink. Was this the aloof, the
handsome, the sarcastic Mr.
Ryan addressing her? A god-
like sub-editor from that small
Olympus beside the composing-
room? The very thought of
drinking alone with him at the
city’s most exclusive hotel
terrified her.
Treading hard on Roma’s
foot, she said, “You see, Mr.
Ryan, Roma and I were
going”
“Then both come. The
company ‘of two lovely girls,”
he said with an ironic bow,
“will be twice as pleasant as
that of one.”
“Oh! We —well, thank you.
Shall we, Stan?”
“If you like, Stan.”
Oeated in the hotel’s softly-
lighted lounge, her feet
sinking into luxurious and
loudly-patterned carpet, Molly
began to feel sophisticated as
she drank a Brandy Cruster
from a pink-sugar-rimmed
glass. It was, she thought, too
pretty to be very strong.
She took one of Jed’s
cigarettes and smoked it in-
expertly, and shouted a second
round of drinks from her
winnings. Jed laughed as the
waiter faded away with a
baffled look.
“Innocence is its own
defence!” he said to Roma.
“She just didn't know she ought
to tip him.”
“Oh, should I have? Oh
dear!”
Roma was looking very chic
in a black dress with a white
collar, and a little black velvet
hat like an artist’s beret. Catch-
ing sight of herself in the
mirror-panelled wall, Molly
decided that she would never
wear this mouse-brown hat
again. Tomorrow she would
buy a slinky black dress and
a small black hat that would
show most of her red —no,
auburn—curls.
After the second drink the
others seemed to her very witty,
and they all laughed a great
deal. Molly felt elated. This
was seeing Life. And suddenly
she was no longer nervous of
Jed Ryan. He was singing,
quietly and solemnly, a little
ditty beginning:
Caviare comes from virgin
sturgeon,
Virgin sturgeon is a fish....
Then •-Roma, who had a
dinner-date, said she must go.
She seemed to expect Molly
to accompany her, but Molly,
who rather resented Roma's
attempts to be protective from
the vantage-point of her extra
four years, was wilfully dense.
When Roma was gone Jed
leaned towards Molly.
“I know a little pub in the
hills,” he said, looking into
her eyes, “where you can get
the most wonderful fillet steak
in the Southern Hemisphere.
Care to try it?”
“I should think that in
Argentina”—said Molly in a
fuddled way; but she found
that she was already being
propelled towards the door.
His hand on her arm sent a
tremor of happiness through
her. Really, he had the most
astounding light-green eyes.
Hypnotic, almost. She floated
down the stairs without seem-
ing to touch more than one
or two.
“My car’s round at the
garage,” he said. “Rather a
long walk, but I was getting the
oil changed.”
“Let’s go in my Strawberry.
She’s just there, outside the
office.”
“Well ... is it safe?”
“Terribly safe. The safest
car in the Southern Hemi-
sphere.”
He laughed. “All right. Come
on.”
Outside, it was unexpectedly
night. Molly had the sensation
of being in a play. Act 11,
Scene 1: Evening. A city
street . . .
The tall buildings, bright
with lights where the army of
cleaners worked, were unreal
and illusory as cardboard
scenery. Happily, Strawberry’s
headlights worked, for once.
They got in, and roared towards
the hills whose rounded out-
lines showed dark against the
sky, like the breasts of some
giant Ethiopian queen.
"Car away below them the
city lights sparkled as
though that queen had flung
down all her jewels. Green,
white, red, and amber, in rope
and necklace and diadem,


they ended in the dark blank
line of the coast where a light-
house winked rhythmically its
warning spark.
Molly leant close to the
windscreen and felt happiness
rise in her throat like a bubble.
They had found the little pub
in the hills, a low, rambling
place with a deserted dining-
room. They had a cold beer
while they waited for the steak,
and a bottle of the local
burgundy with the steak when
it came.
Molly thought that Jed knew
she would have been shy in
the big, ornate dining-room of
the Strathallan, and that it was
thoughtful of him to bring her
here. It did not occur to her
that it was also much cheaper.
Now, rather dizzy with the
beer and the burgundy
combined with the altitude,
she looked out across the lights
and felt that she was in a
plane just coming in to land
from some far, romantic city.
Jed turned with one arm along
the seat-back and contemplated
her neat profile ; the burnished,
springy curls revealed now that
she had removed the unbecom-
ing hat. He carefully put out
his cigarette.
“You’re a pretty wonderful
girl, you know,” he said . . .
And a few minutes later, “I’d
better take you home, I
suppose.”
But she didn't want to go
home. She wanted to spend
seme of her winnings; she
wanted to go to the Blue
Lagoon, she had never been in
a real night-club.
“I just want to see it,” she
said.
Jed smiled indulgently. “All
right; but you’d better let me
drive, I think,” he said.
On the way down the curv-
ing road she was swung against
his shoulder on the bends. She
looked up at his dark face in
' the glow of the dashboard light.
“I can’t believe I’m really
here with you, like this.”
He chuckled. “You didn't
think my interest in you was
purely paternal, did you?”
“I didn’t think you were
interested at all. I was just
simply terrified of you, that’s
all.”
“Poor little Molly. I did
bark at you a few times, didn't
I? But it was nothing per-
sonal. Just trying to make a
good journalist of you. Cubs
ought to be terrified.”
“Then you shouldn’t have
spoilt the effect by bringing me
up here and . . . and”
“And proving myself a mere,
weak male? Well, I am. But
please believe I didn’t plan all
this when I asked you to come
~ and have a drink. I was lonely.
I didn’t want to go home to
an empty house.”
“You’re not married, are
you?”
“Who told you that?” His
voice was teasing.
“Nobody, but —I mean, you
wouldn’t have asked me”
“Oh, what an innocent! So
you think a married man would
never go out with anyone but
his wife?”
“I didn’t.say that.” She was
beginning to feel cross. “I
meant you wouldn’t be lonely.”
“No, you’re right.” He
sighed sharply. “My wife left
me, years ago.”
“Oh, I’m sorry! But how
could slie have? I mean”
He laughed at the naive,
implied compliment.
“I’m not easy to live with,
I suppose. You know what a
sarcastic beggar I can be.”
“I think you’re very nice.”
“You’re sweet.”
He kissed her hand, his eyes
on the road.
'T'he band was playing a blues,
wearily, as though their
day’s work had not just begun.
The tired drummer looked as
if the sticks would fall at any
moment from his nerveless
fingers. A solitary couple
gyrated between the tables.
Molly, gazing round at the
luxurious, mysterious blue
curtains, and back at the
bubbles in her hollow-stemmed
glass, felt giddy with joy ; this
was the ultimate- haunt of sin
and sophistication. Here she
was, not yet nineteen, drinking
sparkling Moselle in a night-
club with a terribly handsome
man, a divorced man, of more
than thirty.
Jed watched indulgently
while she ate an asparagus
omelette and sipped her wine,
chattering all the while. More
couples drifted in, and Jed
and Molly danced. She stopped
suddenly with a stricken face.
“I forgot! I simply must ring
Mummy and tell her where I
am. She’ll think I’ve gone to
Roma’s to tea, but l’m not
home soon they’ll have the
Vice Squad looking for me.”
She used a telephone on the
wall behind the blue curtains.
The bubbles of the wine seemed
to have got into her head, and
she had some trouble with the
number. Her father’s voice
came over the wire at last.
Molly realised that the sound
of the dance-band would drift
through the mouthpiece . . .
no use pretending. “Daddy, it’s
me. I’m at the”
“You’ll have to speak up,
Molly, I can’t hear a word.”
“I’m at the Glue Balloon,”
she shouted.
“Jessie!' Come here, it’s
Molly,” she could hear him
calling agitatedly. “She’s at
some dreadful place!”
Her mother’s calm voice
replaced his, and Molly ex-
plained that she would be
rather late, and where she was
ringing from.
“But who are you with,
dear?”
She pretended not to hear.
“It’s perfectly all right. There
are only about four people
here, and they are most respec-
tably eating Lobster Mornay.”
“You’re to be home by mid-
night, do you hear?”'
“Yes, Mummy. Goodnight.”
She went back to the table,
her eyes sparkling with black
mischief. “Daddy nearly had a
fit, but it’s all right.”
They danced again. She
leaned back and watched the
ceiling revolve. “At the still
point of the turning world . 5 .
Have I had too much to
drink?” she wondered giddily,
and then ceased to wonder or
to care.
She heard with vague sur-
prise Jed remarking that she
had beautiful eyes and a flaw-
less complexion . . . and, by
some transition she failed to
grasp, that he had a collection
of early editions he would like
her to see . . . Australiana , < ,
When Roma came in with
" ’ her current escort it seemed
absolutely right; the perfect
finish to this magical evening.
“There’s Stan!” she cried.
“Hi, Stan! Come and join us.
That’s Bob Crossland with her.”
“I can’t follow this,” said
Jed, who looked none too
pleased. “Which is Stan?”
“Roma, of course. We call
each other Stan?”
“But why? And how can
you both be Stan?”
“It’s too complicated to
explain,” said Molly.
Roma was inspecting her
rather oddly, Molly noticed.
She had quite a grim look, and
scarcely spoke to Jed. When
Roma led the way to the
toilet Molly meekly followed.
“Really, Stan!” Roma
rounded on her as soon as
they were inside the door
marked “Ladies.” “You
shouldn't be allowed out with-
out a keeper! How much have
you had to drink? And what
are you doing here with Jed
Ryan? I thought you were
going straight home from the
Strath.”
“We had dinner in the hills,”
said Molly, raising her eyes
from a fascinated contempla-
tion of a terrazzo floor that
heaved in gentle waves like the
sea.
“Oh, no! What happened?
Quickly! ”
“Nothing happened quickly.
He kissed me, very chastely
. . . and he kissed my hand.
That’s all.”
Roma relaxed a little. “Not
a false move ; I see. My dear
Stan, don't you know the repu-
tation he’s got? Don’t you
know his wife divorced him?
Has he mentioned your eyes
yet?”
“He said I had beautiful
eyes.”
Molly sighed sentimentally
“Ha! That sort begin at your
eyes and work down. Has he
asked you home with him?”
“He did mention some books
he wanted me to see on the
way home—rare, r’markable
editions.”
“Huh, no etchings?”
“He probably has etchings.
I'm sure he's very artistic.”
“You’re coming home with
us, my girl. I’ll drive Straw-
berry, and Bob will follow in
his car. You’re in no lit
state”
“I’m perfectly fit, my dear
Stan,” said Molly with
elaborate dignity, “to —oh! I
don’t think I feel very well.”
TVText day she felt very much
worse ; her mother, with
an uncanny sense for what
would be most repulsive to
Molly, gave her a lightly-done
egg for breakfast and watched
with an eagle eye till it was
consumed.
She felt no better after a.
stern and lengthy lecture from
Roma ; for, having been goaded
at last to an exasperated “Oh,
shut up!” she bounced into
the corridor and almost into
Jed Ryan, who gave her a
frosty smile and a cool “Good-
morning, my dear.”
His expression was pained ;
it said that he had no time for
immature girls who couldn’t
trust their own judgment. Or
him. He passed on his Olym-
pian way towards the subs.’
room.
Molly, feeling very young
and crushed, went round to
her desk and opened the
morning paper.
Instantly she brightened.
There was a whole page of
advertisements of very slinky
black dresses, and she still had
some of her winnings left,
though she had insisted on
spending some at the nightclub.
She saw herself in form-
fitting black, with exotic ear-
rings and a cigarette in a
long holder, looking with
exquisite boredom at a row of
first editions:
“....very interesting, my
dear Jed. But let’s go on to
the Gay Mamba now, shall
we?”


Grazing-rights in the Snowy Mountains
Don't Erode Our Heritage
By CHARLES PEEKING
IN defiance of all informed scientific
opinion, some 300 snow - lessees,
anxious to retain the right to graze
their stock in the high catchments
of the Snowy Mountains, are making a
bid to reverse the N.S.W. Government
decision of late last year that grazing
should cease above the 4500 ft. level.
Their attempt is being made through
the Labor M.L.A. for the Monaro, J.
Seiffert, who faces a strong political
challenge at the next State election. He
is a member of the Park Trust, and, as
a Labor man, he presumably believes in
the people’s assets being available to the
people. Yet, by his continued determina-
tion to seek caucus approval for restora-
tion of the high grazing-leases, he is
pleading for the vested interests of a
small group.
The angry reactions which have greeted
this move are not merely political. They
have included protests from that section
of the Cahill Cabinet which accepts the
need for preservation and conservation,
and which last year, through Conserva-
tion Minister Wetherell, succeeded in
defeating the ranks of the Lands Depart-
ment, its Minister and its representatives
on the Park Trust.
Expert Findings
'T'hey have also included impartial ex-
perts whose findings are purely objec-
tive and emphatically convincing. Those
findings, summarised last year by the
Australian Academy of Science, which
set up a special committee of investiga-
tion into the subject, have not been
challenged by any facts or acceptable
theories.
In addition —and this is less generally
known —the Graziers’ Association has
also rejected the pleas of the snow-
lessees. It remains to be seen whether
the caucus members who had a four-day
junket in the area at the instance of Mr.
Seiffert are prepared to reject all expert
opinion and aid in destroying an area
unique in Australia and of inestimable
beauty and economic national im-
portance. Surely they will refuse to do so.
One inevitable result of the Seiffert
move is strong pressure for his own
removal from the Park Trust, as well
as the removal of Mr. L. Barry, one
of the snow-lessees, and their replace-
ment by well-qualified professional
biologists, selected (in the words of the
academy report) “because of their in-
terest in national parks or in conservation
generally.” Such appointments are
urgently needed.
The problem of erosion in the Snowy
area demands even greater attention
than it has so far received. In the mean-
time, there is conclusive evidence of
excessive and deplorable damage as a
result of grazing and practices connected
with it. No amount of special pleading
can obscure the findings—although the
complexity and overlapping of the
present administration of the area makes
allocation of past and future responsi-
bilities extremely difficult.
The basic fact is that the watershed
value of the regions must be the para-
mount consideration.
The scientists don’t want to ignore
all other interests. But, in the words
of the N.S.W. Soil Conservation Service
quoted in the academy report, “the
principle to be adopted by all instru-
mentalities having interest in the Snowy
catchment-areas must be the maximum
protection from any deterioration by
erosion ; inescapably this involves cessa-
tion or a drastic restriction of use by
stock . . .”
This comment was followed by the
recommendations of the special com-
mittee of the academy for complete
exclusion of all grazing - animals from
the important catchments at heights
above 4500 ft.; the effective policing
of that exclusion ; research for 10 years
into the desirability of limited grazing
at lower levels as a measure of
catchment-management; the prohibition
of burning-off in the catchments; the
re-examination of all engineering works
on the higher levels (“probably the most
serious erosion hazard connected with
engineering activities is that caused by
the many miles of spur roads”); and
the formation of a new trust or board
for the Kosciusko State Park, of which
the chairman “should represent conserva-
tion interests rather than those of the
Lands Department.”
The trust is overweighted at present
with Lands Department nominees and
supporters, apart from being under the
chairmanship of the Minister of Lands —■
whose department is concerned with
allocation and exploitation of land, not
with conservation.
The academy also said, mildly but
quite effectively, that grazing-interests
could be looked after by the Lands
Department representative on the trust,
“and there would be no need for anyone
with direct personal concern with snow-
leases to be a member.”
Enduring Value
'T'his great area is a national heritage.
It has immense and enduring value
to the nation for irrigation, for hydro-
electricity, as an area of wonderful
beauty, unequalled facilities for recrea-
tion and for the preservation of our
unique natural flora and fauna. It must
not be exploited for political purposes
or personal profit.
The Snowy Mountains Authority, itself
engrossed in erosion causes and effects,
strongly opposes grazing on the higher
levels.
The great scheme, of which the primary
purpose is irrigation, will make available
an additional 1,818,000 acre-feet of water
annually for irrigation—l,o2o,ooo acre-
feet for the Murrumbidgee area and
798,000 acre-feet for the Murray Valley.
Small wonder that the Murray Valley
Development League has been most vocal
in opposing the claims of the snow->
lessees.
The quantity to be released (after it has
created vast amounts of hydroelectric
power) will provide enough water to
irrigate more than 600,000 acres of dry
but fertile land —or more than the present
irrigated areas of N.S.W. The annual
value of produce from the area to be
irrigated is estimated at £25 million.
Australians today are spending £2 per
head a year on the Snowy scheme, or
about £2O million a year in all. They
have a stake in its preservation and
development for the nation. They can-
not afford to see it destroyed.
There are no homesteads in the area
above 4000 ft., and there is strong reason
to believe that cessation of snow-leases
would lead to an improvement in the
lower pastures, for which there is plenty
of scope.
No Alternative Area
little-stressed aspect of the situa-
tion is that the potential value of
the Snowy area for grazing is, at the
most, only 3 per cent, of its value for
water-conservation. Compared with the
value of grazing in N.S.W. the Snowy
area represents between 0.1 and 0.3 per
cent, of the total —an insignificant
amount. But we have no alternative
area in any part of the continent for
the preservation of irrigation and hydro-
electric water or for National Park
purposes.
The snow-lessees and Mr. Seiffert have
kept understandably silent on the views
of the Graziers’ Association, which
decided some time ago to oppose
renewal of snow-leases.
The association appointed an expert
committee to examine the area and the
conflicting claims. That committee made
a detailed examination—and it recom-
mended not only that grazing should be
prohibited above 4500 ft. but also that
permission to graze stock below that
level should depend in every case on
expert assessment of the merits.

Racing at Rosehill last Satur-
day made the Epsom look more
open. Some well-fancied
runners were downed. Caesar
was beaten into third place by
Gay Port and On Parade in
the Quality Handicap ; but Gay
Port is one of the best sprinters
—if not the best sprinter—in
Australia. As Caesar came from
second-last at the home-turn his
effort was sound. Also he failed
to secure a clear run in the
straight. Huntly wasn’t pro-
duced at Rosehill, but his recent
wins are a sound pointer to his
prospects. Amanullah won at
Randwick on Sept. 13 over
seven furlongs in fast time, and
he, too, looks a real chance.
Others likely to be well fancied
include Turkestan, Young
Idealist and Troy.
Caranna’s grip on the Metro-
politan was strengthened by
his brilliant success in the
Rosehill Cup. Raced by A. E.
and G. W. Cobcroft, Caranna
equalled the race record (2.3)
for 10 furlongs, set four years
ago by El Ziet. Caranna carried
9.4, or 21b. above his Metrop.
impost. Most danger may
come from the much-improved
Essayist and Macdougal.
Essayist won at 11 furlongs at
Warwick Farm last Wednesday,
beating Macdougal a length,
with Medallion third. Essayist
drops to 7st., so Caranna will
be giving him a lot of weight.
Derby fancies didn't sport
silk at Rosehill; Wool-
sack was taken from thb
Auburn Stakes after accept-
ances, but he’s ready for the
classic. Bold Pilot has gal-
loped attractively since his
Rosehill Guineas win, and has
pleased trainer T. J. Smith.
Prince Kerdieil, who should be
an outsider in the Derby, is
working well at Rosebery. He
was narrowly beaten by Bold
Pilot at Rosehill. Melbourne’s
Sir Blink has progressed the
right way following his
unlucky third in the Rosehill
Guineas, in which Woolsack
ran fourth. The last-named
is eligible for Encourage com-
pany, but he is a winner in
modest class, and the Derby has
been won on occasions by
three-year-olds with moderate
prior success. If an upset is in
store, then Woolsack could be
the one to bring it about.
There was a slight crowd out-
burst against jockey George
Moore when Prince Darius was
easily beaten by Skyline in the
Hill Stakes. That heckling was
stupid, but Moore’s riding of
Marksman, beaten favorite in
the Auburn Stakes, did not
seem up to his usual standard.
Maybe Marksman isn’t as good
as was thought, but Moore set
him a tough task, and the
winner, Judicare, was going
equally as well as the favorite
on the wdnning-line.
• • • •
Randwick trainer Frank Dal-
ton completed a successful
week when he won another
double at Rosehill. Three days
earlier he had won two races
at Warwick Farm, with Glister
and Big Ben, and at Rosehill
Glister won again, while
Caranna landed the Rosehill
Cup at short odds. Apprentice
S. Farrawell celebrated his 17th
birthday by winning on
Glister at Rosehill, and his
horsemanship earned him a
well-merited round of applause.
Amazing feature of the win
was that the gelding was
quoted at 10 to 1, despite his
stylish win at a furlong further
distance three days earlier, and
with only lib. less in the saddle.
Glister led most of the way on
each occasion and should win
in better-class sprint-company.
None of three horses preferred
to Glister in the betting at
Rosehill filled a place.
• • • a
Many horses find it difficult
to win Graduation Stakes races
with 9st. That weight beat the
favorite, New Farm, in Rose-
hill’s Second Parramatta Stakes.
Half Sound, who narrowly
downed New Farm, formerly
raced as Alamo, and was then
a member of T. J. Smith’s
stable. He had shown plenty
of speed, but no stamina, and
after T. D. Brosnan secured
him the grey was taken to
courses away from the city. He
looked particularly fit at Rose-
hill, where his condition so
impressing observers that he
was backed from 7 to 1 to
second-favoritism at 9 to 2. In
recent months Half Sound has
won races at Moree, Tamworth
and Inverell, and he scored by
six lengths at Gosford on
September 9. His former
owner, T. Powell, saw him win
at Rosehill. Johnno (third)
appeared the unlucky horse of
the race. He was back in the
field at the home-turn.
Owner-trainer Leo O’Sulli-
van broke a recently unlucky
run. with his horses when Gay
Port had an effortless win in
the Theo Marks Quality Handi-
cap. Gay Port hadn’t raced
for more than four months, but
O’Sullivan gets horses fit for
first-up wins if they’re equal
to it. Saturday’s win was Gay
Port’s fourth in succession, and
he could add to his winnings
at Randwick.

Melbourne Form
First of the important three-
year-old events of the season
in Melbourne, the £2600
Moonee Valley Stakes pro-
duced a surprise result. Punters’
interest in the field of seven
was practically confined to
Master Rane, Misting and
Webster. Few gave any thought
to the winner, the chestnut
Valbridge gelding San Remo.
Until the last stride it looked
as if warm favorite Master
Rane would land the money,
but Brian Hall used a lot of
vigor to kick his mount home
right on the line. Misting was

many lengths away, third. In
July San Remo won a mile
event at Flemington in good
style, but he had been out of
action for about 10 weeks.
Time, 1.48|, was the slowest
for the race since the distance
was altered to a mile in 1937.
Although the first heat of
the Chandos Handicap (six fur-
longs less 20yds.) was not an
important event, the three-
year-old chestnut filly Heart’s
Content put up one of the day’s
best performances at the
Valley in winning. On the
same track last month she
won the Merri Handicap
unbacked at 66 to 1. On Satur-
day there were no fancy prices
about her, with only Premier
Bolte’s speedy Meadow Bird
preferred in the betting. Slowly
away, Heart’s Content swept
around the field to win as she
liked. She is down to run in
the semi-classic Edward Mani-
fold Stakes at Flemington next
Saturday—a big step up in
class, but she is a most promis-
ing sort, and could prove right
up to the best of her age and
sex in the land. She is by
Emperor from Lady Waljeers
by Pamphilos from Deserve
by Enfield from Beneficiary
(an imported mare) by Happy
Man. The family produced Mel-
bourne Cup winner Rimfire.
Studmaster Jim Roach had
reason to be pleased with the
success of Teruko in the second
Chandos —he has the filly’s sire,
Jambo, and dam, White Flag,
at his Asten Lodge Stud in
Dandenong. Actually, the filly
was not bred on the property.
Roach bought the dam and
filly at a dispersal sale of the
late John Wren’s stock, and
later still bought the sire. Prior
to settling in Victoria, Roach
was successful as a studmaster
and owner in South Australia,
where he owned the Beaufield
Stud at Gawler River. Teruko
won by any number of lengths,
and the best has still to be
seen of her.
• •’ • •
Some well-cherished Cup
hopes looked pretty faint after
the 10-furlongs Glenara Handi-
cap at the VaUey. The winner,
Medulla, has been taken out
of the Cups as not being class
enough. Nevertheless he
coasted home from a field that
included South Australians
Newstone and Auteuil, Vic-
torians Magic Nib and San-
dule, and the Caulfield Cup
hope of Fred Hoysted’s stable,
Chief Wongo. The heavy going
discounts the form somewhat.
Prior to Saturday’s win, the
Neapolitan gelding had scored
a five-lengths victory at Werri-
bee. However, he has been
up a long time, and must be
due for a spell.
• • • •
One horse who really appre-
ciated the muddy conditions at
the Valley was former Queens-
lander Malarno. As a two-
year-old Malarno was one of
the best youngsters in the
northern State, but later he
developed shelly feet, and his
owners, pastoralists A. G.
Adnan and G. S. Macdiarmid,
sent him south to race on Mel-
bourne’s softer tracks. He
gave notice of Saturday’s win
when he ran Top Fred to a
photo-finish down the straight-
six at Flemington a couple of
weeks ago. Jack Raffaele
(who’s close enough to 50) had
the mount on Malarno. Not
long back from . Colombo,
where he rode for 20-odd
years, Raffaele has a son older
than many of the boys riding
against him. Incidentally, the
son knows something about
speed—he was a brilliant
sprinter at Xavier College.
With Melbourne short of
good-class senior jockeys,
Westralian Frank Treen is
keenly sought by owners. He
rode a double at the Valley,
on Medulla and Burette, and
trainer Tom Woodcock gave
him the credit for Burette’s
improved form to win the
second Nulla Nulla Welter.
Gay Saba, ridden by Vic-
torian Alan Burton, won the
Invitation Stakes at Caulfield
last Thursday. The four-year-
old Sabaean-Dunmurry horse
carried top-weight of 9.1. New
Zealand-bred, Gay Saba is
raced by W. Balloch on lease
from J. P. Stratton, president
of the Westralian Trotting
Association.
In his latest success, in the
10-furlongs Underwood Stakes
at Caulfield last Thursday, Lord
ran a brilliant race, running his
rivals off their feet from end
to end. It was his fifth in a
row, and took his stake-earn-
ings past £ll,OOO. He is in
such form he looks a match
for the best w.-f.-a. horses in
the land. Lord Gavin did well
to run second to Lord. He is
going along nicely in his
pieparation for his spring
mission, the Caulfield Cup. He
looks Victoria’s best show in
that race.

Melbourne two-year-olds will
race for the first time this
season at Flemington next
Saturday. Sir Lorrient, Worth-
ing and Gay Summer looked
the best of the colts in the trials;
Snowflower, Lady Sandhurst
and Veiled Memories showed
promise among the fillies. The
mile £3OOO Edward Manifold
Stakes for three-year-old fillies
is on the same programme.
But Beautiful, top Melbourne
filly, and Wiggle meet in this
race. The £2OOO Turnbull
Stakes (lfm. ; w.f.a.) may give
Lord Gavin his first win of the
season.

Trots
Bathurst pacer Miniature
Bill qualified for the £5OOO
Spring Cup on a waterlogged
Harold Park track last Friday
night, defeating heavily-backed
favorite First Division by half
a length in the Harold Park
Handicap. Diamed (100 to
1) was third. Miniature Bill,
who had shown good form in
three country races after a
winter spell, was having his
first run this season at Flarold
Park. Pocketed most of the
way, First Division got clear
in the straight and made a
valiant effort, finishing wide
out. Miniature Bill was driven
by A. D. (Tony) Turnbull,
brother of Joe Turnbull, who
will drive topnotch pacer First
Kiss in the £2OOO Spring
Handicap this month.
Winner of three races in
succession at the end of last
season, Jenny (from 36yds. be-
hind) beat favorite Kyogle
Wirra (24yds.) by half-a-length
in the Trotters’ Handicap.
Racing on the outside of
Kyogle Wirra for most of the
journey, Jenny took the lead
in the straight and finished
strongly. She had run only
fifth to Kyogle Wirra when
(Sept. 12) he won the Trotters’
Handicap by 25 lengths.
Winning his third race in
a row, Sir Raider, beating
equal-favorites Delvyn Ringer
and Colonist, became eligible
for the Spring Handicap, the
first heats of which will be
run at Harold Park on Friday,

1851 at Cowes, was won by
American defender Columbia,
which defeated Britain’s challenger
Sceptre. The last challenge was in
1937. Some change in the course

5-17, while the best bowling-
effort on the day was Jim

off-breaks delivered with a
jerky action, bags oodles of
wickets cheaply in grade, but

enough bowling in the big-

BRITAIN'S "COLOR PROBLEM"
'T'he British press on the
A whole maintained an
admirably intelligent attitude
towards the “race - riots”
between Teddy-boys and
colored immigrants, although it
was left to “New York Times”
to set the matter down in calm,
historical perspective:
“In his classic work, Eng-
lish Social History, G. M.
Trevelyan, after mentioning
that Edward I expelled the Jews
from England in 1290, wrote:
‘This expulsion of the Jews is
one cause why anti-Semitism
is today less strong in England
than in many countries of
Europe.’ By the time the Jews
were allowed to return in
Cromwell’s time, ‘the English
had learnt to stand alone, and
could meet without jealousy
that gifted race on equal
terms.’
“Civic equality was not
granted to Roman Catholic
Britons until the Catholic
Emancipation Act of 1829, but
even in 1850 there were popular
outbursts against so-called
‘Papal aggression.’
“In contemporary times we
have seen the animosity of
Britons toward Italian war-
prisoners and Italian and Polish
coalminers. The reasons were
economic (threatening the jobs
and rate of pay of the workers)
and sex.. The same two reasons
operate in the race-strife today,
plus a measure of juvenile delin-
qbency that is new.
“It will be interesting to see
how the British reassert their
normal tolerance and good
sense.”
Reassertion of that “toler-
ance” and “good sense” as far
as the British press was con-
cerned consisted mainly of
grave editorial discussions
which were agreed on the need
for “exemplary fines and
punishment” of “youths who
regard color-baiting as a new
and cheap form of entertain-
ment,” and not quite so unani-
mous on the unrestricted entry
into Britain of any member of
the British Commonwealth.
Typical comment:

ham is a sharp reminder that
Britain is no more immune
from racial prejudice than
South Africa or Algeria or
the Southern States of America.
Not only can it happen here:
it can and does happen every-
where, for fear and hatred of
an alien minority is one of the
eternal human problems which
society must always solve.
“The easy way out of the
difficulty, which two members
of Parliament have already
advocated, is to stop or severely
limit the immigration of colored
people into these islands. That,
essentially, is the way chosen
by Australia in her White Aus-
tralia policy, by South Africa
in apartheid, by Moslems and
Hindus in the partition of India.
For us [Britain] to adopt it
would be a shameful admission
that the problem is too difficult
for us to solve and that a
multi-racial society is impos-
sible. Those who advocate it
should logically demand the
withdrawal of all white settlers
from Kenya and Rhodesia and
accept the division of the world
on lines of color.
“The hard way, but also the
right way, is to try to remove
the fears and hatreds of both
sides by a wise combination of
leadership and education. That
is what, to its credit, the United
States is trying to do in an
infinitely more difficult situ-
ation.”
* * *
R. H. Irvine, in a letter to
“Manchester Guardian’’: “The
real impracticability of the
present official view that every
British subject or citizen of a
country within the Common-
wealth has a right to come
‘hofne’ is to be found in the
fact that Britain is the most
densely populated national
political unit within an inter-
national community of over
600-million people, while it is
also the only independent
member-country which strictly
adheres to the idea of a
common citizenship.
“Canadian regulations, for
example, allow the permanent
entry of only 100 Indians, 100
Pakistanis, and 50 Ceylonese
per annum, and West Indians
require special permission for
settlement in Canada. It need
hardly be pointed out that the
comparable rules in Australia,
New Zealand and South Africa
are much more stringent.
Ceylon has deemed it necessary
to exclude Indians, and there
has not been a free movement
of people between India and
Pakistan. Ghana and Malaya
operate a system of entry-
permits for Commonwealth
nationals.
“Of course, the most
ironical situation exists in the
West Indies, where a main
obstacle to the federation of
the British territories has been
the refusal of some of them
to accept immigrants from the
neighboring islands.
“Is Britain justified in deny-
ing herself the clear advantages
of selective immigration for the
sake of ideals to which few, if
any, of the other States with
. whom she is at present associ-
ated subscribe?”
* * $
Birenda Kumar Jha, in a
letter to “Manchester
Guardian’’: “I am convinced
• that relatively only a small
minority of uninformed people
actively practise the color-bar.
They are the people who are
largely driven by a deep-rooted
and inherent prejudice against
the colored races. In the ulti-
mate analysis the whole thing
boils-down to ignorance the
sort of ignorance which is not
always capable of prognosis or
treatment. It is only with
increasing intercourse between
various races of the world that
a better, maturer understand-
ing will grow. For that reason
the people who prescribe
restrictions on immigrants from
the colored Commonwealth
countries as a solution to the
color-problem are, in my sub-
mission, wrong.”

“The aim now must be to
disperse the first group the
louts —before positive sympathy
for their actions spreads to the
other two groups, who are
merely fuddled or foolish. It
is not often that hard punish-
ment is a solution to any

* * *
London “Spectator” : “Two
proposals are being canvassed
to prevent racial strife from
spreading and recurring in
Britain: that there should be
restrictions on entry of immi-
grants from the Common-
wealth; and that the law
should be amended to allow
immigrants who are considered
undesirable to be deported.
Nobody, not even the immi-
grants themselves, can feel that
the present system of un-
restricted entry is satisfactory :
the difficulty is to think of a
way in which it can be regu-
lated without jeopardising the
agreeable homogeneity of the
Commonwealth, and without
creating a barrier which would
in practice discriminate against
color.
“No doubt some of the white
rioters in Nottingham and
Notting Hill are moved by
simple racial antipathy, but in
general it can safely be said
that color is not —not yet —
a serious problem in Britain.
The real trouble arises not from
the numbers of colored immi-
grants but from the ghetto
style of living into which they
are forced by the fact that so
little accommodation is avail-
able for them. They flood into a
few slum and near-slum areas,
creating antagonism among the
poor whites already installed
there, and providing the kind
of community where crime and
gangsterism can easily breed.
“The real requirement, in
fact, is not so much to restrict
immigration to men who have
already secured jobs (most of
them come for casual labor,
where there is still a very real
need for them, even if it is not
quite so great as it was) but
to prevent those who arrive
from overcrowding certain
districts. For such overcrowd-
ing colored people are by no
means solely responsible ; the
Irish come in at almost as fast
a rate; they, too, tend to
gravitate together, at least
until they are acclimatised ;
they, too, create dissension in
the neighborhoods they
invade.”
• • • •
The same: “That deporta-
tion should follow criminal
activities by immigrants seems
at first sight a reasonable sug-
gestion : but it should not be
forgotten that the crimes with
which they tend to be identified
are frequently the product of
their environment of condi-
tions created by the com-
munity’s inability to absorb
them. And in some cases the
trouble might be more satis-
factorily remedied by legisla-
tion, which is long overdue, to
deal with activities that would
continue to be a public scandal
whether immigrants partici-
pated in them or not.
“The growth of prostitution
in London is a typical example.
From being a city which was,
at least to outward appearances,
quite respectable, London has
developed into a hive of
prostitutes second to none in
quantity, if somewhat deficient
in quality, in the world.
Whether the recommendations
of the Wolfenden Report, if
put into practice, would help
to deal with this repellent
spectacle, or whether they
would merely sweep vice ‘under
the carpet,’ must remain a
matter for dispute ; but clearly
something must be done. The
proposals should at least be
given a trial. As it is, by doing
nothing the Government has
helped to precipitate, if not
actually to cause, the recent
race-riots ; for xenophobia has
been inflamed by the suggestion
that vice is all caused by wops
or niggers—rather than by its
customers.
“In any case, whatever is
undertaken to deal with the
immediate problem of race-
rioting, there is certainly a
need for a detailed investiga-
tion of the whole color-problem
in Britain: and the sooner it
is undertaken the better.”
* * *
London “New Statesman” :
“The pattern of Nottingham
indicates that mob-violence may
break-out even when colored
immigrants remain indoors.
The sombre curve of crimes
of violence in this country—
to which the Metropolitan
Police Commissioner’s report
draws urgent attention—the
spectacular success of recent
horror-films, of a degraded
viciousness hitherto unknown,
and the frightening increase in
the habit of carrying deadly
weapons, all testify to the
existence of a latent reservoir
of violence for which race-
hatred merely provides an out-
let.
“Mr. Macmillan and Mr.
Butler properly distinguish
between long-term and short-
term aspects of the problem.
But in raising publicly the
question of immigration-
control they are pandering to
the demands of the panic-
stricken. If a quota were im-
posed, its effects would not be
felt for some time. There are
less than 200,000 colored immi-
grants in Britain ; the number
arriving has fallen sharply over
the past two years, and most of
the new arrivals are now
women and children.
“Such trends will in time
remove any genuine causes of
race tension ; and, indeed, these
have never been formidable.
There is no evidence that

colored immigrants have a dis-
proportionate tendency to
crimes of violence and brothel-
keeping an allegation fre-
quently made to justify white
hostility. Social-workers and
police agree that very few of
them carry weapons, and that
the vast majority are pitifully
anxious to avoid trouble. In
short, colored people are
attacked merely because they
are a small, defenceless and
easily identifiable minority, and
as such form an obvious target
for gangs of youths bent on
violence.
“The authorities, however,
can do little more than prevent
the problem from getting out
of hand. Ultimately its solu-
tion depends on the individual
sense of responsibility of those
able to influence opinion in the
affected areas. Local M.P.s
should get down to practical
field-work instead of clamor-
ing for retrograde legislation.
Trade-union leaders have an
important role to play. So, too,
have ministers of religion,
particularly Roman Catholic
priests in districts where Irish
immigrants form a potential or
actual anti-colored force.
“Above all, the press and
television must take care to
avoid sensationalism when
dealing with color-questions.
Newspapers, despite their
generally admirable editorial
attitudes, have undoubtedly
aggravated tension by emo-
tional reporting of racial
clashes: they should give more
coverage to the far more
numerous instances of
harmony. Indeed, faced with
this madness, the sane every-
where must mobilise. Virtually
all educated people in this
country [Britain] deplore color-
prejudice. It is up to each
individual to ensure that the
good sense and tolerance of
the majority triumph over the
atavistic urges of the few.”
Anti-nuclear Crusade
Writing in London “En-
counter” on the U.K.’s cru-
saders against nuclear weapons
and nuclear warfare “God
save Britain from ever lacking
such men and women. God save
her also from ever following
their advice”—Paul Ignotus
comments that “the dangers
about which they warn are real
dangers. One cannot be suffi-
ciently horrified by them. But
the remedies they propose
would be bound to increase the
dangers instead of eliminating
them.”
After considering several of
the crusaders’ arguments in
that vein, Ignotus touches on
one of their most publicised
contentions —that surrender and
survival under an enemy would
be preferable to nuclear war-
fare. Presumably referring to
Bertrand Russell, he comments
that ‘‘the great thinker who has
placed himself at the head of
the anti-nuclear crusade —and
who has spoken so superbly on
behalf of man’s freedom in
general and the freedom of my
native land [Hungary] in par-
ticular —has gone to great
lengths to demonstrate to the
CHRYS, IN LONDON “DAILY MAIL.”
world what its doom, in the
event of unlimited thermo-
nuclear warfare, would be
like” :
“He did not go to equivalent
lengths to demonstrate what it
would be like to survive under
unlimited tyranny. Both of
these dangers are real, and both
are equally unprecedented in
the memory of mankind. Every
tyranny up to now has been
limited by the absence of
mechanical means to exert
pressure on every subject
simultaneously and constantly,
and by the existence of rival
tyrannies (if not always free
countries).
“The Second World War
liberated us from the danger of
a tyranny expanding over the
globe and becoming so petrified
and waterproof as to exclude
the possibility of its ever being
shaken from ‘inside’ once it
had eliminated those defying it
from ‘outside.’ All the hopes
vested by moralists in the revolt
of human conscience, or by
dialectical materialists in class
warfare or the stress of ‘internal
contradictions,’ proved futile
until bombers, guns and tanks
arrived on the spot in suffi-
cient quantity to evoke
conscience and make contradic-
tions manifest.
“Short of this, Hitler might
have been absolutely justified
in his prophecy that mankind
would live under the system
established by him for
thousands of years to come,
This system was quite clearly
designed as a form of slavery
for most human-beings. It
was to transform mankind into
almost another animal species,
It was to exterminate, with
reasonable chances of success,
all potentialities of what we
call human,
“At the apex of this system,
world power was to be concen-
trated in the hands of one ruler.
There has never been, and can
never be, a guarantee of such
a ruler’s not being in a mood
for committing suicide in the
company of everybody else.
Nor is there any reason to think
that, should civil discord flare
up within the ruling class, or
civil war between it and its
slaves, nuclear, weapons would
not be used unhesitatingly,
Mankind could have got
eventual extermination in addi-
lion to immediate slavery.
“Does anyone believe for a
moment that in a future con-
flict between Communist Russia
and Communist China either
regime would scruple to drop
H-bombs?”
U.K. Labor
Further suggestions (from
Edinburgh “Scotsman”) on the
declining fortunes of the British
Labor Party noted here in
last week’s comment on the
reviving popularity of the Con-
servatives :
“Several months ago the
political doctors were trying to
find the reasons for the debility
of the Conservative party. That
patient has recovered, and now
they are shaking their heads
over the Labor party. ‘Some-
thing has gone badly wrong
for the Labor party.’ Thus the
‘New Statesman’ a Socialist
journal, though often a thorn
in the flesh of the party leader-
ship.
“This proposition is echoed
by commentators of various
schools of thought. A pamphlet
by a Conservative, John
Connell, goes further. Its title,
‘Death on the Left,' is a clear
indication of Mr. Connell’s
thesis. It is premature to say
that life is extinct in the Labor
party, but undoubtedly despon-
dency and the fear of an [early]
election have replaced the
blithe mood in which the
Socialist leaders looked forward
to taking over from an un-
popular Government without
any particular effort on their
own part.
“In Mr. Connell’s view
Labor is dead because moral
fervor has gone out of it. True,
its zeal has cooled sipce the
legendary days of Keir Hardie,
but then it had the freedom
of an irresponsible group.
After the experience of the
practical problems of office its
attitude is bound to be less
prophetic. There was little of
the crusader about Lord Attlee
and his lieutenants, and Mr.
Gaitskell’s lack of fire hardly
explains the party's predica-
ment. In any case, the trade-
union wing has generally been
a conservative element in the
Socialist movement.
“Perhaps the Labor party
gained power arid lost its soul,
but voters are not greatly con-
cerned about the spiritual and
moral state of a party, which
there is no way of measuring.
What a party proposes to do,
if elected, is more important.
“Labor's trouble, according
to the ‘New Statesman's’
diagnosis, is the leadership’s

‘patent fear of commitment.’
Mr. Gaitskell’s attempt to
attract middle-class voters by
giving the party’s prospectus a
moderate air has likely cooled
the enthusiasm of convinced
supporters. Witness the latest
Gallup Poll, which showed that
most Labor voters would like
a shift to the Left in the party’s
policy.
“Labor leaders have to
balance the claims of the con-
verted against those of potential
middle-class recruits. What-
ever way they decide, they will
have to state their policy much
more briefly and pungently, and
evolve constructive ideas
instead of harking back to
1951.
plight is not too
serious. In by-elections the
party held its ground, but it
failed to profit from the
Government’s temporary
decline; it needs a cure for
stagnation. Labor’s depression
should not lead Conservatives
to underrate their opponents, as
the Socialists did a few short
months ago. The political
climate can change quickly,
though it is possible that radical
notions have ceased to attract
masses of voters enjoying fairly
good living-standards. Socialists
may have worked themselves
out of a job by the social revo-
lution of post-war years.”

about a year-and-a-half”:
“Stocks in the four countries
at June 1 this year were 1726-
million bushels more than
200-million bushels down on
N.Y. “Herald Tribune"
“LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT MY ALLERGIES .”
those held on the same date in
1957. But the U.S. bumper
harvest is virtually certain to
bring the surplus back at least
to its 1957 level, in spite of
the fact that the Canadian
harvest is not expected to be
very good (latest official esti-
mates are of 339-million bushels
compared with 374-million in
1957 and 573-million in 1956).”
After discussing the friction
arising from America’s disposal
of wheat to foreign countries
under “exceptionally favorable
conditions” —by gift, long-
term credit arrangements,
barter, or for local currency
for investment or U.S. spend-
ing in the countries concerned
—the “Financial Times” writer
comments that, “clearly, the
only really satisfactory long-
term solution to the problem
of surpluses would be for pro-
duction to be reduced in the
main producing countries so
that stocks could be run down
to a more reasonable level. But
so far as the U.S. is concerned,
it must be said in fairness to
the Commodity Credit Cor-
poration that there have
already been attempts to reduce
wheat-production. The C.C.C.
has restricted payment of its
guaranteed price for wheat to
those farmers who agree to
reduce their acreage under
t wheat by a certain proportion.
“But it has not been wholly
successful, because the farmers
have resorted to more intensive
cultivation, planting the wheat
more closely and using more
fertiliser. This and techno-
logical improvements, such as
better insecticides and hybrid
seed—which is more productive
than normal grain—have meant
that, although the U.S. wheat-
acreage has decreased by
about one-third since 1952,
production has remained sub-
stantially at the same level.
“Probably the only measure
which would really bring down
wheat-production in the U.S.
would be a reduction in the
price paid to farmers by the
C.C.C. Some idea of the level
of price-support in the U.S. is
given by the fact that compar-
able wheats, exported at just
under $1.70 a bushel from
Canada and from the U.S.
alike, fetch $1.44 a bushel for
the Canadian farmer, but are
brought up by subsidies to
$1.93 for the American (all
prices in U.S. dollars).
“However, even assuming
that artificially raised prices
are the cause of the wheat-
surplus, it cannot be said that
the U.S. alone is responsible,
sincß almost every country
supports its wheatfarmers either
by guaranteed prices, subsidies
or tariffs. The price paid to
the farmer in many European
countries, in particular, is well
above that paid to the farmers
of the U.S. In the Netherlands
the comparable figure is $1.99
a bushel, slightly more than
the U.S. price. In Italy it is
$2.99, half as much again as
the American farmer gets.
“But the whole problem of
the world wheat-surplus will
certainly be discussed early in
1959, when a United Nations
conference is expected to meet
to discuss the renewal of the
International Wheat Agree-
ment, due to expire in July of
next year. The present agree-
ment deals only with guaranteed
prices and export and import
quotas.
“There have been signs that
the main producers are resign-
ing themselves to a permanent
substantial surplus of wheat;
a Canadian Minister, for
example, stated recently that
Canada would not object to
maintaining a permanent
surplus of 250-million bushels.
But the Canadian surplus at
present is of nearly 700-million
bushels, and those of the U.S.,
Argentina and Australia are
equally large in relation to then-
acreage.
“For this reason it is felt
in many quarters that no new
wheat-agreement will be of any
real use unless it includes some
provision about limiting pro-
duction. It has been suggested
that this might take the form
of an undertaking on the part
of the member-countries to
link support-prices for their
various agricultural products
more closely to the pattern of
demand.”


Women's Letters
SYDNEY
The prevalence of elves? ballet-girls,
Highlanders and other exotically clad
creatures in the Sydney streets last week
might have given visitors the impression
that this town is even more unconven-
tional in its dress than reported in soberer
cities. This was not the case, however,
for the flocks of fairies, etc., were merely
representatives of young Australia eager
to try-out their talents in the City of
Sydney’s 21st Eisteddfod.
As it would be only the most dedicated
of reporters who would follow the efforts
of the hundreds of competitors, it was
decided that the pleasantest way to get
an over-all picture of the eisteddfod was
to attend the concert given midweek at
the Empire Theatre by some of the prize-
winners. And a delightful concert it
proved. /
Outstanding was the singing of the
Fort Street Boys’ High School Choir,
which won the Stamina Boys’ School
Championship. Though not a large
choir, its choice of songs and quality
of singing showed true musicianship. The
Senior Girls’ Championship Choir from
Cremorne Girls’ High School also pro-
vided delightful singing, and, though
their songs did not appeal quite so much
to this Letter, the girls had taken much
more care to present an appearance of
uniformity and neatness in dress and
grouping than did the boys.
A sigh went up from the audience when
the curtain rose on the winners of the
Junior Percussion Band, five years and
under. These were the tinies from St.
Francis Xavier’s School, and they looked
absolutely minute as they stood grouped
with precision on the huge stage of the
Empire Theatre. Then on came their
conductor, one Antonnino Zonno, aged
five years, who wielded the baton with
the assurance and control of one three
times his age.
Some excellent ballet-dancing was seen
in the finals of the Intermediate Ballet
Scholarship. Miss Rowena Jackson
(from the Royal Ballet Company) judged
the contest with Miss Christobel
Desmazures, and from the four finalists
—Beverley Dean, Winsome Gooi,
Meredith Kinmont (all of Sydney) and
Margaret Akerman, of Lambton —they
awarded the prize to the country girl.
The trophies for the sections represented
in this concert were presented to the
winners by Mrs. R. J. Heffron, wife of
the Minister for Education.

The Town Hall bloomed into flower
on Friday night when 13 debs! made
their bow to the Governor; Sir Eric
Woodward, and Lady Woodward at the
Lady Mayoress’s Ball. Among the debs,
was Jan Jensen, daughter of the Lord
Mayor and Lady Mayoress, and her
dress was of filmy white tulle with a
bustle-bow. The official party included
the Premier and Mrs. Cahill and Air-
Vice-Marshal C. D. Candy and Mrs.
Candy.

from a tour of England and the Con-
tinent. Her sister Colleen, also a nursing-
sister, is at present in the U.S. but will
return, to Sydney in December to help

A most interesting talk on the making
of the musical play “Lola Montez,”
which will be seen shortly at the
Elizabethan Theatre, was given by the
writer of the lyrifcs, Peter Benjamin, at
the luncheon of the Women Writers’
Society. Lola Montez, the fiery dancer
who set Australia aflame during the mid-
19th century, apparently did not take
quietly to unfavorable remarks about
her in the press and sought revenge by
horsewhipping the editor (who horse-
whipped her in return), and it is around
this episode that the new Australian
musical is written. Other guests-of-
honor at the luncheon were the author,
Alan Burke, the composer of the music,
Peter Stannard, and the leading lady,
Mary Preston. In returning a vote of
thanks to the speaker, the Countess
de Vilme-Hautemont told some interest-
ing anecdotes of the Lola Montez season
in Sydney wfcen ladies who wanted to
see her disguised themselves and sat at
the back of the theatre so that they would
not be noticed. These reminiscences had
been told to the Countess by her late
husband, the actor Howard Vernon.

Hats were the highlights of the “My
Fair Lady” fashion-parade held at the
Trocadero during the week in aid of
St. Joseph’s Children’s Home, Croydon.
One—a wig made of strips of organdie
(which looked like shredded coconut) and
two wide ones encircled with misty
ospreys—brought sighs from the 600
women present. The guest-of-honor,
Mrs. J. J. Cahill, was welcomed by Mrs.
C. M. Guiney, whose niece, Mrs. H. P. W.
Powell, of Neally, Girilambone, was also
in the audience. Compere Gwen Plumb
made witty comments throughout Ahe
showing, and singer James Harris added
to the general entertainment.

The first function organised by the
newly-formed Associated Catholic Com-
mittee will be a formal reception at which
the laity will pay their respects to the
Governor, Sir Eric Woodward. The
reception will be held at the Trocadero
on November 13 at 8 p.m., and it is
expected that every section of the R.C.
community will be represented.
Mrs. T. G. Conneely, who is president
of the new committee, says that its
primary object is to help the lesser-known
charities, such as the Seaside Home for
Children at Maroubra, which cares for
children whose mothers "have to go to
hospital for any period. So often, Mrs.
Conneely adds, such mothers put-off
necessary medical attention until too late
because they cannot find anyone to look
after their families. The Seaside Home
at Maroubra is run by the Pauline Nuns,
who came from Italy specially to estab-
lish it, and who have been in charge
since the beginning of the year.

Plans for the 1958 White Cross dinner-
dance were discussed by committee-
members of the St. John Ambulance
Brigade Headquarters Auxiliary at their
meeting during the week. At the ball,
which will be held at Prince’s on October

who are patrons of the St. John Ambu-

The death occurred during the week
of Mrs. Lilian Warren, of Chatswood,
president of the Australian Federation
of University Women. Mrs. Warren,
who was elected to this office in January
of this year and for the previous three
years had been president of the Sydney
University *Women Graduates’ Associa-
tion, was educated at the Presbyterian
Ladies’ College, Croydon, and the Uni-
versity of Sydney. She married soon
after graduating in science in 1921, and
lived for nearly 20 years in Ceylon.
Until recently she was a member of the
executive of the Australian Association
for the United Nations and vice-president
of the Australian Organisations Co-
ordinating Committee for Overseas


Students. She was also a member of
the Council of Sydney University Settle-
ment. She is survived by her husband,
Mr. P. N. Warren, a daughter and two
sons.
MELBOURNE
As elegantly dressed women and their
escorts arrived at the Metro Theatre for
the premiere of the film “Gigi” they were
welcomed with music played by the band
of the Royal Australian Artillery, Third
Division. This premiere was arranged
by the Australian-Asian Association to
assist the funds of International House.
Students from I.H. formed a guard-of-
honor, and a feature of the decorations
were Australian and Asian flags and
beribboned bowls of flowers. Of great
interest was the fashion-parade of eye-
catching gowns made from wonderful
French fabrics.
The official party included the Gover-
nor and Lady Brooks —the latter wearing
a short white re-embroidered lace gown
shading to grey at the hemline and glitter-
ing with iridescent thread—and their
daughter, Mrs. Robin Byrne ; Mrs. Henry
Bolte ; Chancellor of the University Mr.
Justice Dean and Mrs. Dean; U.S.
Consul-General Graham Hall and Mrs.
Hall; Rear-Admiral R. S. Wellby and
Mrs. Wellby ; and Sir Frank and Lady
Selleck. They were received by the
president of the association, Sir Charles
Lowe, and Lady Lowe (who covered her
short jade-green satin frock with a sable
cape), and Sir Albert Coates and Lady
Coates (her short frock was of deep-grey
French-organza worn over pink satin).
Mrs. John Dynon, hon. secretary of
the association, wore a short frock of
pastel-pink French-silk embroidered with
rhinestones. Committee-member Mrs.
Fred Knowles chose a powder-blue crepe
frock worn under a velvet coat in a
deeper blue. Mrs. J. B. Jackson wore
gold and green brocades, Mrs. Dale
Holyman a black frock with a white-
ermine stole. Mrs. Isobel Green covered
her black-lace frock with a copper-lame
coat. A striking red gown and a white-
ermine stole were worn by Mrs. John
Chaldjian. Mrs. Neil Rogers’s beaded
grey chiffons were worn with a sapphire-
blue mink stole.

To usher-in the French Fair, which is
now attracting many visitors to the
Exhibition Building, the French-Austra-
lian Association gave a dinner-dance at
Ciro’s for 150 guests. French and Aus-
tralian flags were used in the decorations,
and novelty boxes of matches from
France were placed on each table.
Official guests were welcomed by the
president of the association, Professor
Maurice Belz, and Mrs. Belz (she wearing
a full-skirted black frock highlighted with
pink roses). They included the Lord
Mayor and Lady Mayoress, Cr. and Mrs.
F. W. Thomas (her lovely frock of pale-
beige lace featured a slim skirt of three
tiers); the president of the French Cham-
ber of Commerce, Mr. F. E. Lampe, and
Mrs. Lampe; the acting-Consul for
France, M. Moriau, and Madame
Moriau; the president of the French
Bank, Mr. C. N. Barrett, and the presi-
dent of the Alliance Franfaise, Madame
A. Gay.
Among the dancers were Mr. and Mrs.
W. K. Burnside (her deep-sea-blue
Chantilly-lace frock very attractive), Mr.
and Mrs. L. R. MacFarlane (her taffetas
in midnight-blue), Mr. and Mrs. E. V.
Roberts (the latter wearing a white-mink
stole with her sequin-trimmed black
frock), Mr. and Mrs. G. Economu, Dr.
and Mrs. T. Crankshaw, and Mr. and
Mrs. Vernon Jones.
Tall, graceful Mrs. Leslie Smith, wife
of a well-known medico who has just

raise money for the school’s building-
fund.
“Warrawong,” an aboriginal word
meaning “on top of a hill,” is the
appropriate name given to the new
kindergarten holiday-home at East Ring-
wood. The home, which looks across
to the Dandenongs, was opened by Lady
Brooks. It includes a day-nursery which
looks just like a kindergarten-room, and
a night-nursery with limited window-
space which allows the youngsters to
sleep better and longer. The bathroom
has everything scaled-down to child-size.
Children are selected from kindergartens,
creches and day-nurseries on the recom-
mendation of either kindergarten-director

The Sacred Heart Cathedral, Bendigo,
was the setting for the marriage of
Margaret May, second daughter of Mrs.
M. Coffey, of Bendigo, and the late Mr.
Michael Coffey. The bride chose a short
white velvet frock, the bodice featuring
a Tudor-neckline embroidered with seed-
pearls, the full skirt caught up at one
side with a gardenia to reveal a pleated
satin underskirt. The short tulle veil
was caught with gardenias, which also
formed the bouquet. Matron-of-honor
was the bride’s sister, Mrs. Keith
Williams, whose ballerina frock of red
velvet was worn with a matching velvet
cap. She carried a white orchid and
lily-of-the-valley. The bridegroom is the
second son of Mr. and Mrs. J. P.
McMahon, of Caulfield. Tom Gleeson,
of Tynong, Gippsland, was best man.
Reception was at Woodbury House,

The Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress
(Cr. and Mrs. F. W. Thomas) were host
and hostess at a late-afternoon reception
to the First Lord of the Admiralty, the
Earl of Selkirk. Mrs. Thomas chose a
slim-fitting frock of black French-crepe
worn with a dyed-ermine stole. A wreath
of brown and beige swathed satin
adorned her hair. On the dais were the
Lieut.-Governor, Sir Edmund Herring,
and Lady Herring ; the Premier and Mrs.
Henry Bolte (her smart black suit with
its relaxed-line jacket was topped with
a cap of massed lily-of-the-valley); Vice-
Admiral Sir Roy Dowling and Lady

Hobart, Sir Archibald Park.


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Low Cost of Fines
During the post-war infla-
tionary era, salaries and wages
of judges, magistrates, police-
men, jail-warders, etc., have,
like those of the rest of the
community, almost trebled.
Yet the States, with few excep-
tions, have neglected to in-
crease the monetary penalties
provided for in their Criminal
Codes or Acts.
As a J.P., I was lately invited .
to “sit on the Bench” at a
Queensland country court-
house. I was associated
thereon with the local C.P.S.
The defendant pleaded guilty
to the charge—a rather serious
one. On adjourning to con-
sider the sentence we con-
sulted the Queensland Criminal
Code, which, in relation to this
offence, provided for a maxi-
mum fine of £25 or six months’
imprisonment. The defendant
being the supporter of a large
family, he was fined £2O. It
was duly paid. The maximum
fine of £25 for this offence was
fixed as the equivalent of six
months’ jail in the year 1900.
On present relative values, the
monetary equivalent of six
months’ jail should be a fine
nearer £lOO.
It is also still common for
policemen to fix bail of 10s.
or £1 on men lumbered for
drunkenness. Invariably there
is no appearance at court, the
bail being forfeited and no
conviction recorded. If the
offender appears and is con-
sidered guilty, a fine and con-
viction are recorded. The fee
for freedom from conviction
should be increased.
Taxpayers as well as State
Treasurers would benefit if the
monetary equivalents of jail-
sentences were brought up to
date. —Wu Foo (Q.).
Ginninderra
May I correct a point in that
article on Ginninderra by Gwen
Hutchings (B. 27/8/’58)?
I am a granddaughter of
Edward Kendall Grace, who
was drowned in Ginninderra
Creek: Gwen Hutchings states:
“Curiously the groom was
buried in St. John the Baptist’s
Church, while the grave of
Edward Grace is marked by a
single post on the bank of the
creek.” .
That is not correct. Edward
Grace was buried in the family
grave not far from the vestry
door of St. John the Baptist’s
Church. The accident occurred
when E. K. G. attempted to
drive a buggy-and-pair through
the flooded creek. The groom's
body was found at the crossing,
while that of Edward Grace
was not found until the
following day about half-a-mile
downstream.
The post to which Miss
“If I Was in her shoes I'd marry the man I loved , and
be damned to the lot of them!"
Hutchings refers was originally
a cross made by the carpenter
employee and erected on the
spot where Edward Grace’s
body was found— Trina L.
Humphries (N.S.W.).
King O’Malley
George Beesley (B. 27/8/’5B)
plays-down the work of King
O’Malley in getting the Com-
monwealth Bank established
and lauds the parts played by
Fisher and Hughes—the men
who for years opposed the
proposal in and out of caucus
and who were eventually
beaten by O’Malley. Of
course they did their best for
the bank —once the party had
spoken. They couldn’t have
done anything else.
I didn’t say that King would
not have resorted to forgery
to gain his end; 1 doubted
the practicability and, by ex-
tension, the truth of a story
that had all the appearance of
a crude attempt to bluff
Hughes (an astute political
fixer himself), Fisher and other
seasoned politicians. I asked
for evidence to support the
story, but Mr. Beesley hasn’t
supplied any.
As to the “questionable
means” adopted by O’Malley,
he met a foeman more than
worthy of his steel in W. M.
Hughes. When Hughes was
Nationalist Prime Minister his
political magic w’as such that,
literally overnight, he trans-
formed a Government minority
of one in the Senate into a
majority of one. Vehement
Australia-wide protests and
Billy’s insistence on his inno-
cence in the matter were
climaxed by one of David
Low’s most famous cartoons
in The Bulletin, captioned
(if 1 remember aright): “The
accused is discharged without
a stain on his character.”
By comparison, King’s loan
of £3O, and even his alleged
forgery, make him a fumbling
amateur in the art and science
of political underground
engineering.
King O’Malley’s buffooneries
should not be allowed to
obscure his undoubted states-
manship. His work just can’t
be dismissed with a deprecia-
tory phrase or two. Without
him there wouldn’t have been
a Commonwealth Bank per-
haps for decades after 1912.
As an independent member of
the S.A. House of Assembly
in 1896 he advocated a
Government bank for the
colony. In Tasmania, as an
independent candidate for the
Reps., he urged (as reported
in the “Mount Lyell Standard”
of January 21, ' 1901) the
creation of an Australian
Government Bank. After his
election he unsuccessfully
sought the support of the first
Prime Minister, Barton, for his
bank objective ; then he joined
the Labor party. The rest of
the story is pretty well known.
Does Mr. Beesley favor or
oppose the Commonwealth
Bank as a financial institution?
He quotes with approval a
statement by Sir Denison
Miller, first governor of the
bank, that he had modelled it
on the Bank of England. Yet
in another item (B. 3/9/’5B)
he doubts whether the nation
has got more value from the
Commonwealth Bank than
from the privately-owned
banks: He can’t have it both
ways.
His statement that if Lang
had been Prime Minister there
might have been a run on the
Commonwealth Bank over-
looks the fact that there was,
in Sydney, a most serious run
on the Commonwealth Savings
Bank after Lang’s bank had
closed its doors. That run
was dramatically stopped by a
forthright broadcast made by
Sir Robert Gibson, chairman
of the Bank Board.
Anyhow, Lang never had
even Buckley’s chance of
becoming Prime Minister. His
demagoguery imposed itself
for a time on the then suscep-
tible electorate of N.S.W.; but
Australia was (and still is)
another cup of tea —J. D.
Corbett (Vic.).

ports of the world, and whose
towering sails and long hulls
are now the memories of a
diminishing band of the deep-
sea sailors who manned them.
As Artist Harry (“Ships’)
Raynor said in his introduc-
tory note in the catalogue, the
sailing-ship was a remarkable
linking of beauty and utility.
The occasion, in the Sydney
Mission to Seamen, was a
remarkable one. The gathering,
a mixture of mariners, their
womenfolk, and the helpers
and supporters of the mission,
was politely attentive —a con-
trast to some of the gatherings
of seamen in the same hall on
occasion in these days when
colored sailors and “Teddy
Boy” stewards comprise a large
proportion of the crews of
visiting vessels.
The artist, a former senior
art-master of the Victorian
Education Department tech-
nical schools, made a few
modest remarks, revealing that
he had known all the ships
whose lovely shapes comprised
the exhibition, and that he felt
anv artistic merit in the paint-
ings was perhaps outweighed
by the value of the technical
record they enshrined of some-
thing which had now vanished
from the surface of the waters.
Then Sir James Bisset,
former Atlantic commodore
and a man whose Liverpool
accent underlined his slightly
pungent recollections of his
apprenticeship in sail, opened
the display at the invitation
of the senior chaplain, the Rev.
Colin Craven-Sands, an ex-
sailorman.
The paintings themselves
should be judged on two
levels—that of lovers of ships
and the sea, and that cf the
artist. They should come out
with credit on both counts —-but
they certainly have the merit of
authenticity and affection.
These are the ships which
thronged Port Jackson so long
ago and will never be seen

Subsidy on Butter
“Murray Swagman” makes
some very wild statements (B.
20 /8 / ’5B). Dairymen have
never asked for cost of produc-
tion plus 20 per cent. What we
have demanded is cost of pro-
duction for all butter sold
locally, plus exports to the
amount of 20 per cent, of local
sales, the balance of exports to
be sold at the overseas price.
This, if granted, would still
return an average price below
the cost-of-production formula.
Then, that land that “not
many” years ago was sold for a
third of its present price! I
suppose ‘not many” means
about 12 years ago, when most
other things, such as farm-
machinery, houses, wages,
motor-cars, work-shirts, etc.,
sold at a third or less of their
present price. Why should the
dairymen be the only ones tied
to 1946 values?
Some shafts strike closer,
however. A subsidy, particu-
larly on exports, is bad, and
justifiable only as a temporary
measure in an emergency. It
was originally given by the
Chifley Government when they
realised that a rise in butter-
price was essential. To have
passed the whole rise on to the
consumers would have been
very unpopular with their own
supporters, as well as bad busi-
ness for the farmers. Un-
fortunately the subsidy, instead
of being gradually eliminated,
seems to have become a per-
manent part of the price-
structure.
The cost -of - production
formula was worked-out
originally as the fairest way
of giving the dairymen a living.
In 1947 it did just that, but
up to about 1953-54 dairy-
men’s real incomes seemed to
be rising, probably because of
the increase in efficiency that
had occurred throughout the
industry. Much of this extra
income was ploughed back,
still further reducing relative
costs and increasing real
incomes. Since 1954 the full
formula price has not been
received, and the gap has
gradually widened. Over the
last two years dairymen's
monetary incomes have fallen,
in this district anyway. The
drought has been the main
reason, but prices are approach-
ing the unpayable level.
The recent rise was, in the
opinion of most dairymen, a
mistake, and was sought and
granted without their approval.
It has raised the price to the
consumer, while reducing the
producer’s return, because of
the diversion of butter to the
export-market. Also the timing
was bad, when all sections
except politicians and civil
servants were being urged to
cut costs.
Actually the trouble with
dairying, as with all our export-
ing industries (mainly primary),
is not that prices are too low
but that internal costs are too
high. Now, with export-prices
falling and unemployment
showing-up here and there, the
whole economy is in a highly
vulnerable condition. If all
sections don’t stop bickering
and unite to cut costs (or
increase output, which is the
same thing), our hands may
eventually be forced by a
depression.— Magnoon (Q.).
Folksongs
The review (B. 13/8/’5B) of
James Reeves’s The Idiom of
the People (an anthology of
150 English folksongs taken
from the Cecil Sharp collection)
was very interesting. It may be
true, as Reeves suggests, that
folksong-collectors of the past
“valued the tunes above the
words,” and this for a good
reason: most British collectors
were musicians. Indeed, until
the invention of tape-recorders,
the collector was obliged to
possess considerable musical
knowledge to enable him to
write down the tunes sung to
him.
Still, as far back as 1912
Marjorie Kennedy-Fraser was
recording “The Songs of the
Hebrides” in Barra, Eriskay and
Uist with the aid of a grapho-
phone. The singers of the
Outer Isles nicknamed the
machine “The Bodoch” (old
man) because of the tremulous,
wheezy manner it played back
the recordings. The grapho-
phone, however, was quite an
innovation. On the whole,
collectors preferred to trust to
their musicianship.
Some Continental Govern-
ments commissioned notable
musicians to round-up all they
could of indigenous song,
but British folksong enthu-
siasts were obliged to gather
the British harvest in their
spare time and at their own
expense. This meant that
nearly all the collecting had to
be made in the lengthy mid-
summer vacation the worst
possible time for such a job,
because then rural workers
were going their hardest. If
the collecting could have been
done during the slack winter
months—when farm-laborers
and crofters are left with time
on their hands—then the song-
harvest would have been even
greater. There would have been
time, too, to hear the same
song again and again and to
check it for those errors about
which critics still carp.
Reeves’s contention that Cecil
Sharp felt obliged “to bowd-
lerise” the words of the songs
“ruinously” may be true ; if he
did so, he had his reasons.
Sharp was collecting in a
particularly prudish era.
Probably the collection would
never have been published if
the publishers considered the
words coarse or frank. In any
case, it was a man-sized job
to persuade the publishers of
those days to as much as look
at anything so far-fetched and
outlandish as a collection of
English folksongs—and if they
had rude verses . . . !
Again, Sharp had sense
enough to see that if “The
Songs of Somerset' were to be
made popular, schoolchildren
would be their best ambas-
sadors. And he was right.
Possibly millions of young
folk have sung and are singing
the songs he collected and
arranged. If the words hadn’t
been “ruinously bowdlerised,”
then it’s likely the songs would
be languishing on library
shelves, of interest only to
antiquarians. The verses of
“Gossip Joan,” as quoted in


The Bulletin, may be the
original ones, but in this form
the song would never have
become the favorite it is. Kids
(and I teach about 600 a week)
would think the quoted version
plain stupid.
Nor need the aforementioned
verses be the original ones.
The English were never as
strong in the strict observance
of an oral tradition as were
their Celtic neighbors in Wales,
Scotland or Ireland. To this
day, in Gaelic-speaking com-
munities, there are families
which specialise (just as their
ancestors had done before them
for centuries) in this same oral
tradition, or “music of the
mouth.” Members of such
families “have the storytelling”
or “they have the singing” in
the sense that the ordinary
storyteller or singer never has.
Because of their impeccable
passing-on of words and music
it is possible, among other
things, sometimes even to
“date” a song. When they sing
of the golden-haired women of
a certain clan who inhabited
a certain island and it is
historical fact that none of the
said clan has lived on that
island since the 12th century,
then it is safe to conclude that
the song existed at least as early
as the 12th century.
In England collectors were
faced with a different set-up.
Sharp and others collected a
great number of songs from
elderly men and women who, in
many cases, tried to think-up
the songs they hadn’t sung since
childhood. Because of the lack
of a living oral tradition (or
a reliable one) it is unlikely
that the words were recalled
100 per cent, accurately. The
fact that collectors were able
to gather a number of variants
of the same song, in regard to
both words and music, tends
to prove this.
How easy it was for the
collector to fall into error is
illustrated by an English folk-
song forlong known as “Ring,
Ring, American Corn.” Apart
from the fact that the first line
didn’t make sense and that folk-
enthusiasts had a notion that it
was well known in England
before anyone there had as
much as heard of America, it
was a good song.
The first line continued
to puzzle everyone who heard
it, till news came of a bedridden
nonagenarian m a remote dis-
trict who knew the song when
he was a boy. Off rushed the
enthusiasts to persuade the old
chap to sing it to them and,"
certainly, when the ancient,
wavery voice was lifted, the
opening line did sound like
“Ring, ring, American corn.”
But after the singer was cajoled
into singing the line over some
20 times, the mystery was
solved, in its indistinct fashion,
the old voice was actually sing-
ing, “Ring, ring, in merry
Lincoln,” which made sense
and showed how easy it was
to note the wrong words.
Hundreds of inaccuracies
such as the “American corn”
must have crept into folksong
collections and, in many cases,
the original words are now
lost for ever. Only a brave man
would maintain that any
particular set of verses, so far
as English folksong is con-
cerned, is the original and the
correct version. Perhaps Cecil
Sharp did alter verses; perhaps
from certain points of view it's
a pity he did so, yet, in the
circumstances, it’s difficult to
see what else he could have
done. If he hadn’t “ruinously
bowdlerised” the verses, it’s
doubtful whether many of us
would have known the songs
today.— Maitri (N.S.W.).
Parents Should Pay
In the Fremantle (W.A.)
Children's Court the other day
three parents were ordered to
pay restitution and costs follow-
ing the conviction of their
children for breaking-and-
entering offences.
Evidence was given against
four boys, aged 12 to 15, who
allegedly admitted thefts from
shops. According to police
statements, gelignite and
ammunition were found in the
eldest boy’s bedroom, and his
parents were aware that he
had been stealing them. As was
pointed out to the court, it must
have been obvious to the
parents of the other boys that
the articles they brought home
were far beyond the means of
their pocket-money.
The parents concerned were
warned that they would be
Professors and Creative
Writers
Theodore Simms, in his article
on the Red Page stressing the
necessity for a Chair of Aus-
tralian Literature, almost con-
vinced me that if I had been
born a couple of decades later
and had had the benefits of
the professor's wisdom I might
have become Australia’s
Dostoevski. In fact, I was on
the point of writing him a letter
of congratulation when a
thought struck me: I suppose
he would regard Henry
Lawson as a creative writer?
So would I, though at one
time I would not. I would
have agreed with the univer-
sities of the time and dismissed
him from serious consideration
as another member of the
wattle-and-daub school. But
the ponit that worries me is:
How did he become creative?
Would he have written
better stories if he had sat at
the feet of some scholarly
professor?
Writers are creative indi-
viduals. Universities are not
creative. They are custodians
of the past, and no doubt do a
useful job in maintaining
critical standards. But that is
where their job ends. —M. G. S.

The principle of visiting the
sins of the children upon the
parents —or at least making the
latter responsible for losses
caused by their offspring—may
be novel (it was the first time
such an order had been made
in a W.A. court), but it has
much to commend it. There
can be little doubt that a very
large proportion of juvenile
crime springs directly from
parental apathy or indifference,
or even from parental
encouragement.
• Parents who knowingly
permit their children to indulge
in vandalism or crime, or take
no steps to correct tendencies
of that nature, can hardly
complain if they are called upon
to foot the bill for such
indulgence. One of the de-
plorable features of the post-
war era has been, in fact, the
relaxation of parental control
and the loss of supervision and
guidance, particularly where
both parents have held full-
time jobs.
The Fremantle court’s de-
cision has served salutary notice
upon neglectful parents. Those
who won’t respond to an appeal
to their commonsense and
decency may at least be in-
fluenced by a threat to their
own pockets.—D. J. G. (Vic.).
Coaching and Teaching
“Teaching and Coaching”
(*Pat,” B. 3/9/’5B) invites
comment. As a graduate teach-
ing in State high-schools over
the last 20 years I have never
seen a child who wanted to
learn denied the interest of his
teachers. I have, however,
frequently seen children who,
having neglected to avail them-
selves of that interest, have
had recourse to “coaching.”
Parents at this stage qo
doubt congratulate themselves
that they are doing their duty
by their children, because they
are paying out hard cash,
Children thus “coached,” how-
ever, often continue to fail to
avail themselves of the interest
of their class teachers, and fill
“Y oo-hoo — Henry! Are you in here ?”
the places that they would have
filled anyhow when the yearly
examinations are held.
I don’t suggest that there
never was a child who for some
reason needed and benefited
from coaching ; but the picture
of the poor child eagerly want-
ing to learn, and being denied
the opportunity by an army
of teachers too busy looking
for more money to teach well
and effectively—that makes me
laugh.
Teaching is hard work, but if
every child wanted to learn, it
would be the easiest and most
satisfying work imaginable.—
M.R. (N.S.W.).
Matches
I pul “P.O.M.C.’s” question
(B. 3/9/’5B) to the manager
of a large match - making
concern some four years ago.
He told me that to make
matches with a shorter stick
would involve such a complete
alteration to the factory plant
that it would be hardly worth
while. As seems to be the
case with so many things, the
cost of the raw material is by
no means the greatest expense
in manufacture. He added thaf
his company was going into
the matter of shorter sticks, but
apparently nothing came of
it. — Ceg (Vic.).
Migration
The reason why the Japanese
did not settle more freely in
Brazil (B. 17/9/’5B) is that they
do not make good pioneers.
Those who could be persuaded
before the Pacific War to leave
the homeland had no urge to
rough-it in other lands. They
did not mind so much going to
a country that was already
functioning, as was California
when they migrated there in
thousands But they had no
taste for the work that ptoneers
always have to do even
though they are such good
workers in their own country,
Many Japanese did emigrate
to Brazil, but the scheme,
although Government - spon-
sored, was largely a failure,
While awaiting their osk ship to
take them from Kobe to Brazil
the migrants were accommo-
dated in the barrack-like Japan-
Brazil Society building near my
home. On my way to the office
I would see them, men and
women, doing p.-t. on the roof
of the building.
In the main they were an
unhappy-looking lot, as most
of them were being “persuaded”
to emigrate. In the same way
the Japanese hated being sent
to their colony of Chosen
(Korea). They disliked living
there and despised the Koreans.
Many insisted on forgathering
with Europeans including
those who would not have
dreamed of doing that in Japan
—saying that all foreigners in
Korea should stick together.
Emigration from Japan to
Manchukuo (Manchuria) was
an. utter failure. So few
Japanese were willing to leave
Japan for that country that
in the end the Government had
to conscript migrants. These
men used to be sent off in
batches of 100 at a time. They
were given a rifle for protection
-against “bandits” and then
placed on farms throughout the
countryside. As they were a
ready-made army they were not
allowed to return to Japan.
When they had been up in
Manchuria for some time
parties of girls were sent up
from Japan to marry these
armed migrant-farmers.
The Japanese reluctance to
leave their country is quite
understandable, because to a
Japanese there is no country
quite like Japan. For genera-
tions, moreover, no Japanese
was permitted, on pain of death,
to leave Japan. A reversal of
that policy would take a bit of
getting used to. Yakipan

Underpants
Before World War II it was
possible to buy in Australia
woollen underpants 34in. by
42in. for a tall, slim man, but
the Chifley Government
ordered the manufacturers to
conform to one pattern—34in.
waist to have 24in. leg, and
36in. waist a 26in. leg, with
the result that a tall, slim
person had to wear 42in.-
waist underpants to have the
required length. Apparently
they’re still doing it. —H. C.

pions were decorated, a storm
cleared spectators from the ring-
sides and cleaned results from
the boards. However, first-day
judging was kept to schedule.
For the first time, Polled
Shorthorns and Polled Here-
fords were not judged until the
second day.
Another innovation was the
awarding of a grand-champion-
ship in each breed instead of
asking the junior champions to
compete for the senior cham-
pionships.
In the new set-up, the junior
and senior champions compete
in a separate contest for the
grand-championship.
Many judges voted their
line-ups as the “best ever,” but
it was apparent that, while tops
were very good, there is still a
tail in most breeds.
The dry-then-wet preparation
period may have contributed
to the somewhat scraggy
appearance of some entries.
In some breeds, notably the
Aberdeen Angus and Short-
horn, the females were better
than the males. In general,
heifers were very classy.
Outstanding Features
Outstanding features of the
parade included:
© A record entry of 226
Aberdeen Angus cattle —49
more than last year and
nearly 90 more than the
next-popular breed.
© A slight recovery in Here-
ford numbers from 85 to
104,
$ The excellent performance
of Est. G. T. Reid, Narran-
gullen, Yass (N.S.W.), which
captured seven of the 10
major Aberdeen Angus
awards.
© The hat-trick of Hereford-
bull championships (1956-
7-8) by Jim Allen’s South
Boorook stud near Mort-
lake.
The winning of several
grand - championships by
junior champions.
© The continued influence of
imported blood in many
prizewinners.
For the first time since the
ban on the import of cloven-
hooved animals because of the
danger of introducing blue-
tongue disease, cattle stood in
a Melbourne show-ring with-
out the hope of more blood
from overseas to maintain and
improve future standards.
Nevertheless there were
definite signs that breeders were
well worthy of the task, and
that the 100 per cent. “Made
in Australia” product would
stand the test.
Narrangullen’s triumph
among the Aberdeen Angus
males and females was a credit
to a great herd and a grand
herdsman. The latter led many
successful beasts for Lind-
say Nicholas’s Terrimallum
South stud before it was
dispersed.
Supreme champion of the
breed was N. Geranium 3, a
beautiful Sydney - Melbourne
champion cow which the judge,
R. H. White, of Guyra, said
was one of the outstanding
animals in the Show.
Its beautiful body was sup-
ported squarely on its legs and
led to a wonderful head and
eye. Its fleshing and color were
also outstanding.
Displaying great type (on
which the judge concentrated
throughout the day) and flesh-
ing, N. Edensor captured. the
senior and grand bull cham-
pionships, scoring from his
older and smoother-coated
half-brother N. Euripides,
whose main asset was a very
good head. The N.Z.-bred
Black Kilham of Mangatoro
sired the supreme champion
as well as these two leading
bulls.
The junior-champion bull,
Woolamai Baron Bold, was
paraded by E. C. and E. I.
Hawkins, of Tocumwal
(N.S.W.). It scored from
Jinamoc Black Shah, one of the
two very creditable entries by
Allan Thompson, of Beaufort,
His other entry, J. Palette,
was reserve senior-champion
cow.
Narrangullen’s champion and
reserve-champion heifers, N.
Roulette and N. Eureca 3, were
both sired by another valuable
New Zealand bull, Jago of
Balfour.
Another New Zealand bull,
Black Sailor of Broomhall, was
in evidence as sire of Messrs.
Hawkins’s winners.
Against some very strong
opposition, blue-ribbons were
also won by L. J. and J. L.
Graves, of Mansfield ; John
C. Wilson, of Camperdown;
John Troup, of Coghills Creek;
and P. J. R. Steele, of
Dandenong,
Herefords
In a welcome return to
popularity Herefords main-
tained the high standard which
they have set in Melbourne.
Tops were particularly good.
This was specially true of the
grand-champion bull, Jim
Allen’s South Boorook Dick,
an imported sire (in utero) that

had won the coveted sash in
Sydney earlier in the year.
With its neck set well into
strongly developed shoulders,
and a grand hindquarter, this
son of Vern Dick was a worthy
champion.
In senior-reserve position was
J. H. Crowe’s (Coolac, N.S.W.)
Gobarralong Golfer, whose
parents were both from the
famous Golf Hill stud.
Junior champion and reserve
champion were, respectively,
Jim Allen's S. B. Lovat and the
slightly older S. B. Orford,
both sons of S. B. Brimful, a
Royal Show winner.
Female championships were
distributed better, with the
senior- and grand-champion
South Caramut Corisande 11,
and reserve champion S. C.
Cora 3 coming from J. E. de
Little's stud at South Caramut.
Although they didn't quite
have the quality of the males,
these cows were both excellent,
said D. Pratten, who adjudi-
cated. J. H. Crowe’s G.
Minerva 3 won the junior
championship from F. M.
MacDiamid and Sons, Burra
Melody 6, from Queanbeyan
(N.S.W.).
Other class-winners included
Kilpatrick Investments Pty.,
Ltd., of Melbourne ; D. Lang-
ham, of Yanco (N.S.W.) ; C. R.
Malseed, of Dartmoor, and
R. L. McEachern, of Strath-
downie.
Shorthorns
The 137 Shorthorns appealed
as the most even-quality breed
on the arena. However, head
and shoulders above the rest
was the beautiful junior-
champion heifer and grand-
champion female, Greenwich
Mina Janet, paraded by Kyalla
Pty., Ltd., of Towrang
(N.S.W.).
This beautiful youngster,, by
Calrossie Paramount from the
imported Basildon Mina 21,
had an excellent body sup-
ported squarely on the legs, and
a wonderful head, outlook and
color, and was thickly fleshed
well down.
She won the grand-
championship from the big-
bodied senior champion
Yaralla Pretty Pancake, owned
by Thomas Falls, of Dingee,
which had a big calf at foot.
Although defeated, this cow
showed good conformation, but
was a. little higher off the
ground than the judge, C.
Parker, of Meandarra, Queens-
land, liked to see.
The reserve-champion cow,
Fulham Belle 2, exhibited by
Alberni Bros., of Ferntree
Gully, also had a calf at foot.
Best bull was the junior
champion, D. R. McCaughey's
Coonong Event, from Wagga,
which displayed great depth,
thickness and balance.
Senior champion, exhibited
by C. P. Fairbairn, of Albury,
was Woomargama Wakeful,
which forced Mugwee Briga-
dier, paraded by D. M. Hore,
of Bowna (N.S.W.), into
reserve position.
Reserve junior-champion bull
and heifer were entered by
Kyalla Pty., Ltd., and Round
Hill Pty. (Culcairn, N.S.W.),
respectively.
Sir Rupert Clarke, of Clarke-
field, scored well in the classes,
but couldn’t break through to
the championship ribbons. J.
H. McKenna and Son, of
Tatura, also took home a blue
ribbon.
Devons
Three studs were represented
in the 44 Devons which
appeared before Frank
Hood, of Albury North, for
adjudication. As a breed, they
showed definite improvement
on previous Melbourne appear-
ances, although there is still
room for betterment in the
legs and hocks —a fault which
was noted last year.
Mrs. Janet Officer, of Warr-
nambool, a keen supporter of
the breed, triumphed this year
by entering the grand-champion
bull, the junior Kilmorey South
Servant 23, and junior reserve-
champion heifer, K. S. Apricot
41.
The young bull was strong in
the bone and even on its feet.
Its conformation won it the
major prize from the well-
performed Newstead 890, a son
of the imported Halsdon Model
3, and owned by A. A. Laidlaw,
of Ararat.
Table Top Estate (Table Top,
N.S.W.) captured both female
championships—the senior with
T. T. Rosemary 7, and the
junior with T. T. Needall, which
went on to win the grand-
championship. Both are
daughters of the imported
Gamlins Hero.
Reserve championships
among the Devons were
notched by Table Top Estate,
junior and senior bull, and
A. A. Laidlaw, senior cow.
Polled Herefords
In Friday's judging, the 116
Polled Herefords showed a
slight decline in numbers from
last year’s record. Nevertheless
there was a general improve-
ment which resulted in high-
class quality, fleshing and, in
the tops especially, smoothness
of handle.
The grand-champion bull
The Braes Aberfyne, bred and
exhibited by J. A. and D. J.
Hanson, of Macarthur, was a
mighty animal with good bone,
head and quality. It was a close
contest with Springfield Bell
Boy, exhibited by S. T. and
Estate C. H. Hawkins.
The latter has been a grand
performer in both Sydney and
Melbourne show-rings, but did
not walk quite as well as the
champion.
Quality was also a feature of
the junior males, in which J.
Lenehan’s (Narrandera,
N.S.W.) Brewarrana Ensign
displayed slightly better flesh-
ing than K. G. Luke's (Romsey)
Deepfield's Magnet, which took
reserve honors. The latter was
a very promising animal that
could develop into an out-
standing sire.
Smoothness was also a
feature of the females, where
Lenehan’s junior - champion
B. Melody went on to take the
grand-championship. In the
seniors the Hawkins team
turned the tables on Hanson
and Son when S. Maritana 3
defeated The Braes Ruby 18.
R. L. McEachern's (Strath-
downie) Ardno Daisy Lass 19
filled junior-reserve position.
Polled Shorthorns
Fleshing and the outlook of
the sires were specially pleas-
ing to J. D. Robertson, of
Scone (N.S.W.), who judged the
20 Polled Shorthorns.
Major prizes were domi-
nated by Merryville Pty., Ltd.,
of Yass (N.S.W), which entered
the grand-champion bull, M.
Gay Robert; reserve-senior
bull, M. Monarch; junior-
champion bull, M. True
Leader; grand - champion
female, the senior M. Dorothy
Perkins 9 ; and junior-champion
and reserve heifers, M.
Mountain Mistress 12 and M.
Mona 2.
Junior-champion bull was a
promising young sire, Weronee
Prince, entered by R. C.
Forsyth, of Cavendish, and the
reserve-champion cow, Green-
wich Estelle lolanthe, was
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(18/9/’58)
Southern Queensland may receive light to moderate
patchy rains in October, but elsewhere poor. The coast
from Rockhampton southwards may receive moderate rain
in November; otherwise good general rains are unlikely until
December, when, however, there may be flooding in the
rivers in the southern half of the State.
N.S.W. may receive patchy rainfall in October, although
moderate rain is indicated on the Central and South Coasts,
Tablelands, South-west Slopes and part of the central-west
area. Light to moderate rain is indicated for November,
with good general rains in the whole State in December.
The southern half of Victoria may receive good rains
during October and November, although rainfall is likely
to be patchy and to vary from light to moderate in the
Mallee and northern divisions. General rains are likely in
December.
The agricultural areas of South Australia may expect
good rains in October, varying from light to moderate
in the Murray Valley, but poor in the upper-north and
interior. November will probably be dry, with good rains
in the whole State during December.
Moderate rain is indicated on the south-west central
coast of Western Australia during October, but poor else-
where in the State. November may also bring only poor
rainfall, but good rains are indicated in part of the south-
west and Kimberleys during December.

of Towrang (N.S.W.).
Dual-purpose Breeds
Among the dual-purpose
breeds Red Poll numbers were
a little disappointing, but the
champion bull, Dungate
Borealis, an importation ex-
hibited by Wilson Beer and
Sons, of Nanneella, attracted a
lot of attention. Elson Smith,
of Warragul, who adjudicated,
said this sire was outstanding.
It handled well and exhibited
the dual-purpose qualities the
breed demanded.
Wilson Beer and Sons com-
pleted the double by adding
to their long tally of champion
cows with Plymouth Kodaklass,
which showed plenty of quality
and excellent udder develop-
ment.
Apart from these good wins,
the honors went to T. E. N.
Payne, of the famous Wood-
burn Stud, at Kilmore, who
won all the other main prizes
except the reserve female-
championship, which went to
D. Payne’s (Kilmore) only
entry, Woodburn Fine Lady.
All of these were excellent
exhibits. Against such classy
opposition, K. R. S. McLennan,
of Derrinal, did well to win
one of the classes.
Dairy Shorthorns maintained
recent improvement to reach
an all-time high, towards which
imported blood has no doubt
played a great part.
This was evidenced in the
champion bull, Kelmscott Gay
Lord 73, which, in addition to
being reserve-champion last
year, sired his victor, which
was bred by his owners,
Atkinson Bros., of Swan Hill.
This year’s champion was bred
by R. R. Hobbs in England.
The top sash fell lightly on
its neck after similar successes
previously in Melbourne and
Sydney. As last year, it was
the father of several class-
winners.
Atkinson Bros, also paraded
a marvellous junior-champion
bull, Willow Park Gay Lord 65,
and reserve junior bull,
W.P.G.L. 54 —both sons of the
senior champion.
From Willow Park came also
the champion cow, W. P. Moss
Rose 79, a daughter of W. P.
Paradox 31, recalling the
famous Churchill Paradox,
which had- such a grand
influence on the breed and won
many Show championships in
its time.
Reserve - champion cow,
Riverslea Cressida 6, and
champion heifer, R.C. 22, were
both exhibited by John Muir
and Sons, of Bacchus Marsh.
J. Iskov and Sons, of Newstead,
showed the reserve-champion
heifer, Morelia Jewel 9.
Dairy Cattle
In general, dairy-cattle main-
tained their quality in keen
contests, which, if anything,
were quieter than usual. Jerseys
have reached a standard hard to
improve.
Friesians displayed some
great bodies and udders, and
the Guernsey breed, although
some representatives appeared
to be high off the ground, was
excellently represented.
“Manoeuvre in underneath ’er, Alec”
Ayrshires appear to be on
the decline numerically,
although the old breeders are
still showing good quality.
The Australian Illawarra
Shorthorn, on the other hand,
is still in the development stage
in which ranginess and the
previous lack of uniformity are
showing signs of stability.
The return of P. J. Maloney
(Tongala) to the top in the
Jersey breed and the continued
success of A. Facey and Sons,
of Millicent (S. Aust.), in
parading the champion bull
were major topics of the ring-
sides.
Aged Jerseys predominated
in quality, but there was also
a lot of class in the long lines
of youngsters which came
before O. Spresser, of Queens-
land, who presided in the ring.
P. J. Maloney and Son’s Bel-
gonia Daisy 5, which won the
championship, was a worthy
winner with a beautiful udder
and conformation. She was
sired by B. Golden Baron and
entered in the four-year-old
class in milk.
Tn reserve position, Francliff
Illusion 5 proved a worthy
daughter of the famous
imported sire Tolgarth Illusion,
whose influence has been seen
before in the Melbourne ring.
Successful owner was R. C.
Broad, of Sutton Grange, who
submitted a big team this year.
Among the bulls, G. and R.
Cox, of Murraydale, scored the
championship with the aged
Bemersyde William, a son of
Belgonia Noella 4th’s Jester.
Runner-up was the four-year-
old King’s Vale Rosaider, bred
by J. Anderson and Sons, and
exhibited by G. L. De Bernard;,
of Somerville.
Aged bulls dominated the
Friesian classes, although the
dairy quality of the females
in milk was also very apparent
to G. McGillivray, of the
N.S.W. Agricultural Depart-
ment, who adjudicated.
Salesian College, of Sun-
bury, was again to the fore with
the champion cow, Ruperts-
wood Carnation Josena, which
showed excellent type and
carried a good vessel.
In reserve position was
Blossom Park Noreen, which
won the aged class'for J. Burg-
man, of Katandra West.
McGillivray selected Hamil-
ton '"businessman R. A.
Strachan’s N.Z.-bred Riverbrae
Korndyke Butterboy from the
aged class as champion bull.
This stylish sire has grand
conformation and breed
quality.
A. W. Pitt, of Moorool-
bark, exhibited the reserve
champion.
Guernseys matched their
numerical advance with good
quality and excellent presenta-
tion. In general, the older
representatives were better
equipped than the up-and-
comings.
Major prizes were well dis-
tributed. The champion
Vermont Ursula, bred and
exhibited by Dr. F. G. Stephens
and Son, of Vermont, displayed
an excellent udder as well as
the other qualities which won
it the honor.
It scored from the four-year-
old Overport Tidy's Pearl, a
daughter of the imported
Worthy Robert 8, from R. G.
Watson's well-known stud at
Frankston. Tidy’s Pearl has
averaged 73351 b. of milk and
4311 b. of butterfat in two lacta-
tions.
J. B. and J. M. Davison, of
Narre Warren, won the bull
championship with Boorganna
Constant, bred by Jim Mc-
Intosh with a Yarraview sire.
He beat H. W. R. Troutbeck, of
Mickleham, whose Yarraview
Transformer came from the
same class.
Older representatives also
overshadowed the youngsters
among the Ayrshires. Gleri-
gowrie Baron Willie 2 ambled
in to win its second successive
bull championship for A. Facey
and Sons, of Millicent (S.A.).
This experienced sire is hold-
ing its condition and breed-type
very well. It is also in the
hands of expert showmen. This
year it scored again from Glen
Cooee Scottish Hero, which it
beat last year, but to which it
bad to down its colors in 1956.
Champion cow was J.
Roland Canobie’s (Narre
Warren) Roland Park Pearl 3,
which, like other top Ayrshires,
had an excellent vessel. Next-
best was Wattle Park Amelia,
led by A. Bunn and Son, of
Tatura.
Top Australian Illawarra
Shorthorns were very good, but
some exhibits looked a little
rough. Outstanding exhibitors
were Bott Bros., of Dingwall,
whose major prizewinners were
champion cow Parkview
Stately 8 ; reserve champion,
Arrandale Stately 4; and
reserve - champion bull, P.
Elegant. . ?
Champion bull, Ovensdale
Pearl’s winner was bred by
J. M. Newton and Sons and
exhibited by N. M. Newton, of
Whorouly, where floods were
bad several weeks ago.
Although successful in the
country, this sire had never
previously won a major city
championship. It was rangy and
displayed fair length, good
conformation and a good
shoulder.

Does Anybody Know?
Can anyone tell me the usual
method employed by the ’Ghans
for driving camel-trains in Aus-
tralia? I’ve seen the teams carrying
copper-ore between Mount Oxide
and the Dobbyn in north-west Q.
years ago; 1 think the oonts
travelled in much the same manner
as a pack-team of horses. Want
the information for an American
cobber who specialises in the history
of old-time transport.
Information Sought
(1) How to detect the presence
of prussic-acid in plants ? (2) Treat-
ment for cattle affected by prussic-
acid poisoning ? (3) Has methylene-
blue been used successfully on
affected animals ?
(1) The suspected plant is finely
cut-up or bruised and placed in a
2oz. wide-mouthed jar. A few
drops of petrol or chloroform are
poured over it, a piece of blotting-
paper moistened with 2 per cent,
sodium-picrate is suspended over
the plant—without touching it—and
the jar is tightly corked. At
summer-room temperature a posi-
tive reaction is denoted by the
presence on the blotting-paper of
a brick-red color, the deepness of
which is an indication of the
amount of acid present. During
winter it is necessary to warm the
bottle slightly before the reaction
takes place. At times an enzyme
will have to be added in order to
hasten the action, and for this
purpose about one-quarter of an
almond should be finely chopped-
up and placed in with the suspected
plant. .
(2) A subcutaneous or intravenous
injection of a solution of 3gm.
sodium-nitrate, 15gm, sodium-
thiosulphate and 30ccs. water;
failing this, a drench of 20z.-4oz.
sodium-thiosulphate in one pint of
water may be administered if the
animal is in a fit condition/to
Swallow.
(3) It has been used overseas, but
belter results have been obtained
in Australia with the foregoing
methods.
$ $ $ $
(1) How do I stand as regards
making corrections to galley-proofs
of a book ? (2) Am 1 obliged to
fork-out for such corrections ?
(1) Once a book is in type, cor-
rections should be kept to a mini-
mum. If corrections have to be
made, the new matter should exactly
fit into the space made by removing
something on the same page to
make room for it. This cannot
always be done, but is. of special
importance when the book is in page-
proof : the cost of rearranging sub-
sequent pages to incorporate new
matter is considerable. Even minor
corrections can be a headache: an
author deletes or adds, say, two or
three words at the beginning of a
paragraph; this necessitates the
overrunning of every line to the end
of that paragraph, and what looks
to the author to be the work of
a moment probably takes a com-
positor half-an-hour to put right.
(2) Most publishers include a
clause in their contracts to the
effect that the cost of corrections
exceeding 20 per cent, of the cost
of composition must be borne by
the author. This may appear to be
a generous allowance, but in point
of fact allows for little to be done,
since the cost of correcting type is
out of all proportion to the original
cost of setting it up.

Brief account of the founding and
growth of the Toe H organisation ?
It was formed to bring together
in Christian fellowship men of
every class and opinion for the pur-
pose of social service of all kinds.
The name Toe H comes from the
Army signallers’ designation of the
initials T.H., which stood for Talbot
House, opened in December, 1915,
at Poperinghe, in -Flanders, as a
chapel and club for soldiers. It w>as
a memorial to Gilbert Talbot, who
was killed in July, 1915, and was
founded by his brother, Neville
Talbot, later Bishop of Pretoria
(S. Africa), and the Rev. P. B.
Clayton.
In 1920 Clayton formed a small
Toe H group in London, and in
1922 an auxiliary body, the League
of Women Helpers, was organised
on the same lines. In (he same
year Toe H was incorporated by
Royal Charter. The fttoveffient,
■which unites all Christian denomina-
tions, has grown, and there are now
many groups and branches through-
out the world.
The war-time history of Toe H
is dealt with in two books by
Clayton: Tales of Talbot House
(1919) and Plain Tales from
Flanders (1929).

I’ve heard that the law regards
threats as a very serious offence.
If so, what’s the scale of punish-
ment ?
It is a felony either (a) verbally
to accuse or threaten to accuse
another of any iniamous crime with
a view to extorting from the person
so accused or threatened or from any
other person any property, money or
valuable security; or ( b ) to send
a letter containing threats to accuse
another person of crime with intent
to extort something of value.
So gravely does the law regard
this otfence that a conviction may
involve a sentence of imprisonment
for life. The guilt or innocence of
the recipient is material only in
considering whether the intention of
the prisoner was to extort money by
his threats, or merely to compound
a felony. Similarly, it is a felony
punishable with imprisonment for
any term up to. life to send a letter
demanding with threats and with-
out reasonable cause any money or
other property. Sending a letter
containing threats to murder a
person, or to burn or destroy his
house, or to maim his cattle, are all
felonies punishable with 10 years’
imprisonment,
Brief Answers
B.C.A. :In view of existing regu-
lations and restrictions it would be
much safer and less trouble to
employ a solicitor ; the cost would
be proportionately slight R.S.:
(1) The question is hard to follow.
As the crime was committed over
100 years ago the criminal would
be dead by now—his soul cannot
be prosecuted. (2) If the purchasers
and their successors, in title have
been in possession of the land for
100 years their title is now legally
secure. (3) Matter too compli-
cated and data insufficient to be
dealt with offhand. Get a legal
opinion. (4) Probably Crown Lands

(Registered under the National Health Act)
REPORT OF THE HONORARY COUNCIL FOR THE
FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 30th JUNE, 1958
Adopted by the Annual Meeting of the Association held in the Conference
Room, Australian Society of Accountants, 5 Bligh Street, Sydney, on
Thursday, 25th September, 1958.
THHE Council has pleasure in presenting the Twelfth Annual Report and
A Financial Statements for the year ended 30th June, 1958.
DEVELOPMENT
Expansion of the Fund continued at a steady rate, and an* additional 300,000
persons became _ eligible for National Health Benefits during the year. Membership
now exceeds 2,500,000, and in Queensland and Tasmania- almost 650,000 persons
are also eligible for hospital benefits.
The decentralisation of the Fund’s enrolment and contribution collection activities
through more than 10,000 employee groups and chemist-agencies makes it possible
for the general public to qualify for Nation at Health Benefits with the greatest
of ease. Employers generally recognise the importance of voluntary health insurance
and assist their employees by enabling them to have contributions deducted from pay.
BLUE CROSS ASSOCIATION
The Fund is a member of the Blue Cross Association which is the co-ordinating
body of the major non-profit health insurance funds in the Commonwealth. Blue Cross
looks to the pooling of experience and research to th'e overall advantage of con-
tributors to tire funds and provides an interstate transfer reciprocity agreement
whereby Fund members who take up residence in another State and join an
affiliated Fund may preserve their benefit rights.
BENEFITS AND ADMINISTRATION
The extent to which the Fund has assisted its contributors and their families may
best be gauged by the benefits paid. During the year, benefits paid amounted to
£7,916,000, an increase of £1,270,200 over the previous year. This takes the total
benefits paid since the Fund's inception to £25,600,000.
Payment of small, straightforward medical benefit claims in cash over the counter,
a feature of Fund service almost unique in insurance of any kind, is being extended.
During the year additional branch claims offices were opened, thus enabling one-
third of all claims received to be paid immediately and the balance within a week.
More cash claims offices are being opened in the larger centres as suitable staff are
trained and premises become available. Local business establishments have been most
helpful in providing office space.
During the year it became evident that the Government contemplated measures to
enable the payment of benefits at present unavailable to contributors and dependants
suffering preexisting or chronic illnesses or who through prolonged illness had
exceeded their benefit limits. The Government has recently announced the new
policy, which has met with general approbation. Nevertheless, the possibility of
increased administrative costs involved in the new policy will need to be closely
scrutinised.
With the occupation of the Fund’s new building in Brisbane, staff efficiency and
service to the public improved and important economies were achieved. Buildings
are in the course of construction in Canberra aijd Townsville, and when occupied
will give further impetus to the Fund’s policy of service through decentralisation.
As forecast in the last annual report, the inability to concentrate staff in the one
building in Sydney and the increased cost of administration due to this cause have
compelled the Council to undertake preliminary measures for the provision of a
single modern building. It is anticipated that a start will be made on the project in
the present financial year.
The medical benefits section of the National Health Service has now been in
operation five years and has developed largely as foreseen. The part of this Fund in
the development has earned high recognition and the fact that 70% of the insurable
population have voluntarily entered the scheme is the most significant proof of its
basic soundness. Nevertheless, attention is being constantly given to improving the
overall coverage and spread of benefits.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
With assets exceeding £2,530,000, of which £1,772,000 are liquid, the financial
position is regarded as sound.
Administrative expenses for the year absorbed only 12.6% of income. Council
recommends the transfer of the sum of £130,000 to Claims'Reserve. The influenza
epidemic of Tate 1957 emphasises the wisdom in maintaining adequate reserves, for
after the above transfer the total Claims Reserve would amount to £2,325,000, which
represents 14/8 per person covered, as against 16/1 last year.
APPRECIATION OF SERVICES
The Council expresses its thanks to:
Employers and group secretaries, to receiving agents, chemists and to 'members of
the medical profession who have co-operated, so wholeheartedly in assisting their
employees and the public generally in securing the advantages of membership with
the Fund.
The Hospitals Contribution Fund of N.S.W. for its valuable assistance.
The Management and Staff, whose untiring efforts have assisted in building a public
utility which is now a vital part of the Australian way of life.

In little town the church bell rung
It brings me news from miles away
I hear the news my heart cries bitterly.
It brings me news it calls me home
I have been too far I can not go
I have not wings I can not fly
I hear the bell my heart bitterly cries.
Another mother she is so kind
She gives me bread she gives me place!
My heart still cries at night and days
My little town my birth home are so
nice.
They are so distant but it was so nice
Among the roses as in paradise
The sun is bright and blue is the sky
I can’t forget my homeland my heart is
crying.
The moon’s like gold and the paddock
green
In my birth house I can’t go in
The trees so high up to the sky
I can’t forget my heart is crying.
I can’t go in I am too far
But every night I see the star
hiie was looking at me in my baby cot
My little town my birth house I never
forget.

Life was almost unbearable
•—but Worse was to come.
They had not been long in
their new abode before they
became the victims of opthal-
mia: “We were all for weeks
feeling our way like blind
people, and were unable to
sleep for pain at night. The
only relief for this distressing
complaint,” she has said, “is
an eye-water composed of a
small quantity of sugar of lead
and a few drops of laudanum.”
However, this was lived
through, and in an astonish-
ingly short time the hut was
transformed into a homestead ;
the cock and hen bought from
a settler on the Murrumbidgee
wefe in a commodious fowl-
yard, and the little settlement
was rapidly transformed into
“the busy home-station of a
large sheep-run.”
Shepherds and their flocks
were arriving from different
directions, and the weighing
of rations for all the men on
the place, and the feeding of
motherless lambs, kept the new
settler’s wife busy.
They also appear to have
had an astonishing number of
visitors for so lonely an out-
post, including Mr. Lands-
borough, the explorer. This
must have been in 1861, for
that is the year when the
Queensland authorities decided
to send out a party in search
of Burke and Wills, and chose
him to. lead the party. Hen-
rietta says: “He delighted us
all by his cheerful and pleasant
conversation. He had one of
the camels belonging to the
ill-fated Burke’s expedition,
and this animal, on making
its appearance among our
horses, caused great tumult;
they were dreadfully fright-
ened, and when put into the
yard trembled violently until
the camel was out of sight.”
One of their blacks was Old
Shepherdy. He had seen Sir
Thomas Mitchell and his party
when they camped on the
Darling River in 1832 (but I
think she has the date wrong,
for according to other sources
I have read he was not there
until May, 1835). Old Shep-
herdy showed them “the exact
spot where they had camped
and named Fort Bourke, the
only vestige remaining of this
fort being a few stumps of
trees now almost hidden by
the foliage of the shrubs grow-
ing thickly around.” She could
have been more helpfully
explicit as to the whereabouts
of the fort. I had not realised
that this was not known until
one day at the Lands Depart-
ment in Sydney I came across
a reference to Henrietta’s son,
Thomas Wade Foott, replying
to a query about it. He was
no more helpful, saying merely
that he could remember it, and
adding no more.
Tn 1864 the Bourke district
A suffered fearfully-, from
floods. The Darling rose
rapidly, sometimes (Henrietta
noted) 3ft. in 24 hours.
At first the inhabitants of
the homestead feared merely
inconvenience and trouble, but
when the river rose to the level
of its banks, and access to the
back station became difficult,
the shepherds were sent off
with their sheep to the back
country, and the blacks disap-
peared, “with their picca-
ninnies, dogs, opposum rugs
and warlike weapons to the
mountain twenty miles off,”
and only one faithful one
remained.
Higher and higher rose the
tempestuous waters of the
river, until at last the little
house, with its stables, store-
houses and fowl-runs, was on
an island surrounded by swift-
running streams. Still the
anxious watchers hoped the
waters might abate. But no,
on came the flood, until the
land as far as the eye could
see was covered by an immense
expanse of water travelling
with such frightening speed
that foam - crested waves
rushed past their dwelling,
making their tenure there more
dangerous every hour.
On March 15 the space
between the kitchen and the
house was cut by water. On
the 17th the Irish cook was
forced to leave the kitchen, the
floor of which had become a
lake. An attempt was made
to light a fire in the homestead
sitting-room, so that at least a
billy of tea could be boiled for
breakfast. But the oncoming
waters oozed up through the
stones in the hearth ; and now
—extraordinary though it
seems —for the first time they
realised the terrible danger of
their position.
Their only possible refuge
was a sandhill a quarter of a
mile away, and here they now
went, rowed by Como, the one
remaining aboriginal. Back-
wards and forwards the little
boat was ferried, until the
eight people and four children,
with sufficient provisions to
last them for a day or two,
were safely transferred to their
fresh home.
When this was done, Como
went off to join his people at
the mountain.
Ti/TAROONED on the sandbank,
Henrietta, all thoughts of
Clova and distant security
banished from her mind,
recorded that each tent was
pitched on an island of its
own, with planks thrown
across the rivulets which
divided them to form a dry
pathway: “Our general sitting-
room being an open, dry space
where the ground was hard,
while our ceiling was the
bright and beautiful blue sky.”
While the tents were being
erected, two young men, one
of them lately engaged as the
storekeeper, had gone back in
the boat to get supplies, not
only for the marooned party
but for the shepherds in the
back country.
At first the islanders were
too busy to notice that the
foragers had not returned.
But the evening of the second
day drew near, and the night
wore on, without them. Had
their boat been overturned
against a submerged post, or
SAND BAR
These are called “sub-fossils” —
chalk-soft or egg-shell brittle
shells on the scrub-covered sand-bar.
They lie in sheets between the golden
wind-rippled alps of the dunes, seaward,
and the lagoon’s drab stubbly mangroves.
There have been changes here, to colder.
Never have I seen fluted red fan-scallops
this size nor ribbed, fragile mactra
in such profusion. All laid out in sheets
crumbed with brown pumice. Layer
has settled into layer as the never-wearying wind
whirls the singing sand in long, ankle-stinging scarves.
One walks with circumspection
resenting the fact each step causes such destruction.

caught in a current and dashed
against a tree?
The watchers had no means
of knowing. To swim from
their island to the homestead,
against such swirling eddies
and strong currents, was a
hazard only to be attempted
as a last resort.
.The third day was spent in
■ . .
vain conjecture When night
approached their anxiety
increased—for their own safety
as well as for the missing men.
. .
Without the boat to fetch
- sh „, provisions, anc 1-
mouths to feed, they could not
last much longer: Hour after
hour did we walk up and down
the narrow strip of ground left
us, watching the gradual, but
certain, rise of the water, and
listening for the slightest sound
that might give us a hope of
relief; but the sun set behind
clouds of purple and gold, and
the pale moon rose calm and
clear, and yet no assistance
came iis ”
A , , . , .
And then—at last!—a boat
appeared.
,
A neighbor had rowed over
to see how they were, and
finding the homestead deserted
and under water, had come in
earch of them.
• As for the two men, it was
found later that they had
robbed the place of many use-
ful things, carrying with them
blankets, coats, rations and
(evidently their worst offence)
the good carpet from the
sitting - room. Then, “afraid
of suffering some' hardship
from the floods, they had pro-
ceeded to a more favored part
of the country.”

bor, his little skiff loaded
with stores, removed the threat
°f starvation, but life could not

twined round a Scottish thistle
engraved on it, must have
looked very out of place on a
sandbank so crowded with
grown-ups and children,
animals, birds and snakes that
it resembled a tented version
of the Ark.
They lived on the sandbank
for seven weeks before the
waters receded enough for
them to return to the home-
stead. When they got back,
Henrietta, cheerful to the end,
stoutly recorded this as being
a gala day. But what changes
met the eye! The little garden
was gone ; mud was every-
where, all over the furniture
—even the Queen Anne cream-
jug, hung in a wash-leather bag
from a hook by the dresser,
was full of it, and the vvalls
and the curtains were stained

this was the end of Henrietta’s
happiness.

The Hollidays
By Middy
“Quick, look-up the French for ‘STOP THIEF’!”


not Gordon or McCrae but Marcus
Clarke.
A very clear, convincing and moving
picture of Clarke emerges from these
compact pages. Drink and improvi-
dence were his downfall. His marriage
(to an actress) turned out a failure; his
brief epistolary love-affair with his
wife’s sister came to nothing. But he
remains a singularly attractive per-
sonality through it all,-with an irresist-
ible touch of gaiety. One particularly
likes the story of how, wanting to take
Victor Daley to dinner, he borrowed
some money from George Ashton under
the plea of “Dire necessity, George,”
and then, forgetting about the dinner,
bought a bottle of champagne and was
caught drinking it by Ashton: “ ‘Dire
necessity, Marcus?’ he said drily. ‘Dire
necessity,’ replied Clarke. ‘Join us.’ ”
And there is also the anecdote of how
once he walked into the office of
Waxman, the moneylender, and put a
pound-note on the table. “ ‘Why, vot
is dat?’ inquired Waxman. ‘Well, I’ll
tell you,’ replied Clarke. ‘The more
money I borrow off you the poorer I
seem to get, so I’ll try what lending you
a little will do.’ But the point of this
story was that Clarke was back again
before the evening was out to borrow
his pound again.”
The most disarming touch of all —
and it seems to be authentic—is that
he died, or at least fell into his final
coma, with his pencil in his hand: still
trying to wyte the play, the operetta,
the novel or the bright journalistic
“column” that, if it wouldn’t be another
masterpiece like “For the Term of His
Natural Life,” would at least bring in
some money for his family and make
manifest to the public once more that
bright spirit, Marcus Clarke.
How did so light a spirit, as Clarke
seems to have been, come to write any-
thing so solid as “His Natural Life”?
Why, amongst a mass of lighter work
(some of which might yet be worth
reprinting or putting on the stage), did
he write only the one great novel?
The answer may be partly, as it is
with Boswell, that a light spirit is not
always so light as its gaiety makes it
appear. But it is also a fact, as Brian
Elliott most interestingly points out,
that “His Natural Life,” though some
pretty earnest research preceded it, was
never intended to be quite the major
work it is; in fact, when it first appeared
in serial form it was a very different
thing. It took its final shape partly
because Sir Charles Gavan Duffy
advised Clarke to rewrite it; and
largely, Brian Elliott suggests, because
the theme itself, even while he was
churning it out for the serial, took hold
of Clarke and forced him into excelling
himself: “The novel, which he had
expected to toss-off easily from his
synopsis, became his old man of the
sea, driving him on to creative flights
far beyond what he intended and far
beyond what he believed his range.”
Incidentally, this was surely not quite
the appropriate occasion for the Oxford
University Press to print, in 'an
advertisement for its World’s Classics
“Australian Short Stories” on “Marcus
Clarke’s” back cover, some Edinburgh
reviewer’s opinion that “Australia has
not yet produced a really great
book” . . .

The Wild Colonial Boy
I am endeavoring to trace the
origins and variants of the old ballad
of “The Wild Colonial Boy.” There
are many versions of the ballad extant
in Ireland, where the hero is repre-
sented as Jack Duggan (or Dougan)
and —peculiar to West Cork —as Ted
Downey. I am not yet successful, how-
ever, in tracing any records of bush-
rangers by such names, although there
was a Dan Duggan out of Ireland
who followed that career some time
about the ’eighties. By that time, of
course, the ballad was already very
popular.
It would seem possible that the name
of the hero of “The Wild Colonial
Boy” varied from New South Wales
to Western Australia. He is variously
Jack Doolan (or Dolan) and Jack
Donohue (or Donoghue, Donohoe,
Donahoo): Bold Jack Donohue (or Jack
O’Donohue) of the Irish ballads.
Donohue arrived in N. S. Wales in
1825 aboard a convict-ship, and four
years later he had escaped from a road-
gang to become the leader of a band
of bushrangers operating on the Great
South Road.
In July, 1830, a pardon was offered
to anyone giving information leading-
to his arrest, and within a year he met
his death in very much the same
manner as that related in “The Wild
Colonial Boy.” His last words are
echoed in that ballad “I’ll fight but
not surrender!” A remarkable affinity
between some of the variants of “Bold
Jack Donohue” and the form of “The
Wild Colonial Boy” does, indeed,
suggest a common root.
What I am particularly interested
to learn is whether “Jack
was an alias used by Donoghue or
whether there really was a Jack
Duggan. There is a strong tradition in
the Castlemaine district of Co. Kerry
that Jack Duggan was the Wild
Colonial Boy of the ballad, and a
ruined house among the hills is still
pointed out as his home. In Ireland
the ballad has had every form from a
romantic old-time waltz to a “rebelly”
rallying cry of the old I.R.A. Fionan
MacColum has advanced the theory
that “colonial” in this context is a
corruption of “Keelonian” (from the
village of Keel, near Castlemaine), and
some of the local (Castlemaine) forms
of the ballad call Duggan “the Wild
Keelonian Boy,” or even—a mid-way
corruption! — “the Wild Keelonial
Boy.”
I am wondering if any of your
readers might be able to help me in
my quest. I would very much welcome
all surviving variants and any infor-
mation —however slight—regarding the
ballad.

Ancient Egypt
The Art and Architecture of Ancient
Egypt, by W. Stevenson Smith, is the
latest in the Pelican History of Art
series, edited by Nikolaus Pevsner, who
was recently in Australia.
The present volume covers an
immensely longer period than any of
the others. The art of ancient Egypt
extends in practically an unbroken line
from 4000 B.C. to the conquest of
Alexander. It was as isolated from
outside influences as was Egyptian
civilisation, which grew-up along the
Nile under no less than thirty-one
dynasties of Pharaohs without a serious
break, the Assyrian and Persian inva-
sions making practically no impression
on its art and institutions.
The odd Pharaoh who was ill-
advised enough to go in for foreign
conquest usually contented himself
with exacting tribute and showed none
of the colonising spirit that the Greeks
had. The Great River rose and fell
with the same regularity as the sun,
and the Egyptian farmer suffered none
of the vicissitudes of the European
farmer; so it is conceivable that the
Egyptian man-in-the-street came to
the conclusion that Nature was a
thoroughly beneficent goddess whom it
was unnecessary to propitiate with
human sacrifice or any nonsense of that
sort; and his art doesn’t show any of
that ill-conscience which dogs the art
of all other races, Western and
Oriental.
But what about those natural soul-
torturers, the artists? It is an extra-
ordinary fact that through all the forty
centuries of Egyptian history there is
no indication that its art ever became
stereotyped or academic.
Those who tend to think of art in
terms of the forms, which includes
the author of the work under discus-
sion, will probably dispute this. For
four-thousand years the forms of
Egyptian art scarcely varied. In their
portrait - statues the priests, the
Pharaohs, the great civil servants, all

sit in the prescribed way, their vic-
torious or advancing armies, the potato-
diggers and the bearers of offerings
from the tribute countries all look in
the same direction, and the designs of
the colossal temples, palaces, tombs
and private houses all observe a rigid
pattern.
It is as if all the poets who have
poetised since Petrarch had expressed
their thoughts and feelings in the
sonnet-form and no other.
But it is not so much the form as
what is put into it that makes a paint-
ing, a poem, a piece of sculpture, a pot,
a building or an abstraction a work of
art; and it is this, and this alone which
makes Egyptian architecture, sculp-
ture, carving and decoration as fresh,
as living and as modern as if it had
been done yesterday instead of five-
thousand years before our time.
The Egyptians observed and reflected
their own surroundings. They con-
cerned themselves with their own
experience, not with the experience of
some prehistoric Picasso; so much so
that when the hordes of the Assyrians,
the Persians and even the Greeks
destroyed their isolation they had no
more effect on their art than a plague
of blowflies. The Egyptian sculptor
and painter remained obsessed with
Nature.
For the cause of this obsession
we need look no further than
old Father Nile. “In an almost rain-
less country,” says Stevenson Smith,
“the regular rise of the Nile every year
provided the striking example of a
renewal of life and gave the Egyptian
a cheerful assurance of the perman-
ence of established things, suggesting
the acceptance that life would some-
how continue after death in the same
way.”
So what nicer service could he per-
form for the dead, whether it was a
Pharaoh or a peasant, than surround
him with replicas of the life he had left
for an afterlife of the same kind, even
to the wives and concubines who had
perchance been buried with him? For
century after century countless myriads
of artists and craftsmen must have
pegged away at this pious duty. Occa-
sionally a genius arose amongst them
who produced such extraordinarily
living sculpture as the head of Myceri-
nus, the seated statue of Hemiunu, of
Sesostris 11, of the fat queen from
Punt, of scribes and civil servants
without number.
These were the people who had built
the Pyramids, the colossal tombs at
Thebes, the temples of Luxor and
Karnak, and the vast palaces. Most
of the Pharaohs seem to have shared
this passion for building, and the bigger
the building the better they liked it.
Problems of construction never seem
to have dismayed their architects any
more than they do Frank Lloyd Wright,
who recently offered to build a build-
ing in New York a mile high; but the
Egyptian architect could do what
Wright can’t—give their colossi some
of the variety which we see in Nature.
It is rather a pity that the author of
the book places so much emphasis on
the temple- and tomb-carvings and
pays such scant attention to the mag-
nificent ruins of Karnak, with their
gloriously carved columns. He is prob-
ably following Matisse, who got his
inspiration for his drawings from these
early carvings; but actually these
frescoes, with their interminable pro-
cessions of figures all walking in the
same direction, have nothing like the
aesthetic content of the later portrait-
statues and the Karnak columns.

interesting and its exposition well-

is too long-winded to hold the reader’s
attention. It is interesting to learn
what clumsy methods were used to
infiltrate agents, such as Vera, the
beautiful Balt, who, with her com-

wit of a Scottish stationmaster. Some
of these spies and saboteurs are still
at large, bqt the general impression left

engineer whose life was in many ways
bound-up with the forces which,

country from a tough, conservative
backwater into part of a modern
planned State. The symbol of this
change is a huge bridge he builds to
link his region with the outside world

These are the best parts of the book.
The rest is a thoroughly workmanlike

The man who got colour from coal
An accident ip a home-made laboratory in England
in 1856 led to the discovery of aniline dyes from
coal tar.
Sir William Perkin was working on a purely scientific
investigation into the possibility of artificially preparing
quinine, when he discovered aniline (or artificial") dye.
This led to the development of dyestuffs in all shades
of purple, red, blue, brown and black, and played an
important role in industrial development.
A.P.M. Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd. which
makes nearly all the paper and paperboard required for
wrapping and packaging Australian goods, uses a large
quantity of dyes each year in producing its 160 kinds
of paper and 140 kinds of paperboard.
Dyes play an important role in colouring the paper and
paperboard sold to other manufacturers who make
attractive and strong boxes, cartons and containers that
are easy to handle and reduce costs here and abroad.
A.P.M. is helping to make Australia self-sufficient in
