THE RED PAGE.
In his recently-issued ‘ Children’s Ways ’ Prof.
Sully reproduces from 1895’s ‘Studies of Child-
hood ’ many authentic scrawls by juvenile artists.
Unillumined parents must regard these with
startled ouriosity. To see elevated to scientific
rank the random caricatures traced deviously on
the slate of ante-bedtime five-year-olds is !
And one cannot say that Prof. Sully exactly justi-
fies his ponderous discussion of the small peoples’
mimicries. The in-aeternum inferences from
four-year-Tommy’s ‘ A HORS ’ or seven-year-
Cissy’s ‘ A MAN ’ remain, after much argument,
invisible. Even the temporary interest is strictly
placid and parental. And none of Prof. Sully’s
examples of child-art is as attractive as those
shown on this page (taken from ‘The Pall Mall
Budget ’of aforetime). Mark the fine sentiment
preserved in the figure of the murderer ! the noble
recklessness of that ‘ pier on the Thames ’! One
feels sure the pier-artist would grow up to
denounce criticism and point out that nobody but
a nice little pig with a curly tail can possibly be
qualified to pass judgment upon nice little pigs
with curly tails.
* * * *
From an impersonal standpoint, children’s art
1b less interesting than savage or aboriginal art,
because it lacks that aesthetic quality of which
adult-age generally shows glimmerings. The
child’s stimulus is not artistic, but imitative—
probably in essence creative ; based on that desire
to make something, that pleasure in the Ego’s
handiwork, which branches in so many directions
from the root of race-preservation. Prof. Sully
takes his mimes a trifle too seriously. Over-
seriousness, indeed, is the fault of his book, as
himself dimly realises. His heavy style clogs the
nimble heels of his subject. With twice the
energy he could have told four times as much in
half the space. Books should be like rivers, with
a free movement to an ultimate sea. Or, if they
he landlocked lakes, replacing with the charm of
rest the strength of motion, the eye should range
infinitely through clear depths. And Prof.
book is like his mind —muddy—with synthesis
swallowed in the cloud of details.
» * * *
Nonetheless, he adds together many attractive
items and illustrations —as, for example, indeal-
ing with the childish imagination. The childish
imagination is a development of the creative
instinct previously referred to : the same force
impels to the building of myths and brick houses :
in each case the essence of the pleasure is a con-
structive emission from the Ego. And as this
creative power lessens, so lessens the individual
or racial hold on life.
* • • •
A child’s capacity for vitalising inanimate ob-
jects springs from sis own superabundant vitality.
Se can not only live simself, but can dower trees
and stones with life by a projection of the Ego—
just as the childlike races did in olden time, as we
know by their myths ; just as childlike savages do
to-day. Jean Ingelow relates how, when about
three years old—
I had the habit of attributing intelligence not only to
all living creatures, the same amount and kind of intelli-
gence that I had myself, but even to stones and manu-
factured articles. I used to feel how dull it must be
for the pebbles in the causeway to be obliged to lie still
and only see what was round about. When I walked out
with a little basket for putting flowers in I used some-
by s[?] Edwen Landseer
aetat 19
times to pick up a pebble or two and carry them on to
have a change: then, at the farthest point of the walk,
turn them out, not doubting they would be pleased to
have a new view.
In other words, Jean Ingelow read her Ego into
the Universe; she re-ereated the Universe in
terms of herself; and that is what every individual
and every race does in greater or less degree, in
proportion as physical organisation supplies the
need and the power.
* * * *
So the reality of a doll to a little girl, or
of a toy-horse to a little boy depending
partly upon the individual brain and its stage
of development—depends partly, perhaps chiefly,
upon the brain’s vital capacity to raise
‘the imagination’ to the required pitch. And
A pier on the Thames.— Sketched by an im-
pressionist artist, aged 2.
a child can see men and women where an
adult sees chips and shells, partly because the
child’s vitality is stronger than the adult’s. A
ohild of very intense vitality does not even need
the symbol. The little girl in William Canton’s
book cuddled in her arms a space of empty air
where she saw the ‘invisible playmate’ lie.
• * * *
Immaturity of the brain may to some extent
account for such feats of the childish imagination.
Before the higher cells have attained full develop-
ment and control a child’s brain is apt to confuse
internal with external perceptions. The child
who, frightened by the story of a bogey-man, fears
to go to bed in the dark, does actually see the
bogey-man in the dark. He is not there to adult
eyes; but he is there to the child’s brain, and
quite conceivably to the child’s eyes—since a
child’s visual centres, normally ill-regulated, may
paint an apparition on the retina just as the ab-
normally ill-regulated centres of an adult can.
When William Canton’s little girl died, her
father, bending over her, saw for a moment her
‘invisible playmate’ in the flesh, just as she saw
it always. He thought the sight ‘ incredible ’—it
was cerebrally quite simple.
• * » *
It follows from what has been said that the need
which many people experience for ‘ perfect
scenery ’ in dramatic representation is partly »
sign of lowered vitality, or possibly of a brain so
busy that it has no surplus vitality to
spare for visualising unseen objects. Yet it is
not so long since, for example, the change of
scene from a forest to a streeb was depicted on
the stage by a mere change of placard from A
Forest to A Street. Shakespeare’s plays were
originally represented on a floor strewn with
rushes, the side walls hung with arras; a board
with ‘Westminster,’ ‘Corinth,’ ‘ Messina,’ fixed
the scene of the play ; the audience’s imagination
did the rest. When a battle was to be fought,
‘ two armies fly in represented by swords and
bucklers, and then ’—asks Sidney in his ‘ Defence
of Poesie’— ‘ what hard heart will not receive it
for a pitched field ? ’ We are more exacting nowa-
days—partly because brain-life has become so com-
plex that we cannot imagine a forest unless we see
scenery simulating a forest, or an army unless we
see at least several dozen supers ; and partly, also,
because- the modern playgoer is not as.strong a
man, not as vital a man, as his forefathers,
ignorant of tea and coffee and tobacco, and of all
the multifarious strains and stresses of an age
which the other day impelled one of its victims to
the pathetic complaint, ‘ It’s so horrid to be
hurried ! ’
• • • *
And note that the scenery-exacting person is
the complex-brained person who goes to see
Irving, not the simpler-brained man who prefers
Chevalier. The audience which enjoys Shake-
speare may be said, generally speaking, to be a
more ‘eduoated’ audience than that which
attends the music-halls ; and it demands more in
the way of scenery to make the drama real to its
brain. ‘The Merchant of Venice’ must be
mounted with historic exactitude. But music-hall
performers do turn after different turn before the
same * interior ; ’ and the spectators never dream of
asking that a coster song shall be sung in a coster
environment, or that an imitation draper’s-shop
shall be fitted up before Dan Leno sings ‘The
Shopwalker.’ The child dispenses with costume
and scenery ; the music-hall audience is content
with costume; the theatrical audience demands
both costume and scenery. And there is a corre-
sponding retrogression in vitality of body and pro-
gression in complexity of brain.
» « » »
[lt would be interesting to argue from this the
place of the Chinese in the vital scale of races. In
a Chinese theatre there is no scenery, no necessity
for scenery, since the vivid Chinese imagination
takes as much as you please for granted. An
actor comes before the audience and says he is a
king, walking in the gardens of his palace. That
is enough for the audience : there is the king,
there are’the gardens, there is com-
plete in every detail. The European eye sees a
curiously-bedizened personage fall flop on tile
boards, get up again, and walk off o.p. ; the
Chinese eye sees a beautiful damsel, crossed in
love, despairing of life, drown herself in the canal
which runs through her father’s estate, and pic-
tures the finding of the body, the solemn funeral,
the grief of the parents, the remorse of the res-
ponsible male, and fifty consequences more or less
remote. —Deductions are left to readers : The
Bulletin doesn’t purpose telling all it knows for
sixpence—or even all it doesn t know.]
* * * *
It is a good observation of Prof. Sully’s that a
child so easily sees quaint likenesses between
objects because sis mind is untroubled by all the
complexity of the objects. A child’s fresh brains
base simple analogies on leading traits the only
traits they recognise; while adults, hoarding a
multitude of impressions, lose vivacity, and lose
also power of detaching single impressions. Thus
the idea of parental relationship, dominant in W.
Canton’s ‘W.V.,’ sent her mind leaping to the
pretty phrase, ‘Aren’t the buds the trees little
girls?’—a phrase poetical, almost recondite, _ to
adult-age, but almost matter-of-fact to a child.
The explanation of nearly all the quaint sayings
of children lies in this reference from their limited
known to the unknown : we smile to see Infinity s
pyramid toppling from such an impossible apex-bal-
ance. Thus one of the first notions of a child, as of
a savage, is that motion implies life.. Ihe little
girl who offered a biscuit to a tram is paralleled
by the Red Indians who brought corn to the first
prairie locomotive. And doubtless the awe with
which Fulton’s steamboat was regarded is kin
to a dog’s fear of a bone moved by a string. The
immature or incompetent intelligence is always
generalising on insufficient data : from one
analogy it argues others, often proceeding
to complete resemblance. Just why the mind
should be so eager to associate unrelated or
I correlated ideas is inexplicable : there is
no physical or psychical explanation of the
reason of the pleasure we take in discover-
ing likenesses or differences in concepts or per-
cepts ; but the pleasure itself is one of the most
notable facts of mental life, especially in children.
Probably this joy in classification accounts for
much of the charm in poetical allusions to stars as
‘ flowers of the sky,’ or to flowers as ‘ stars of the
earth,’or to butterflies as ‘pansies flying’—the
last a childish analogy.
» * * •
A child’s ‘ pitiless logic ’ arises partly from sis
power of subjective concentration. Se not only
Steamer. —Sketched by an impressionist artist,
aged 3½.
sees one aspect of a thing to the possible exclusion
of all other aspects; but temporarily devotes the
whole mental force to the act of seeing. It is
this singleness of view which accounts for much
of the * unfeelingness ’ of childhood. The child’s
mind often cannot hold , more than one
emotion at a time, and the propositions
crowd out the corollaries. Thus the boy who
shouted down the shaft where his brother had
fallen, ‘Say, Tommy, if you don’t ever come up
alive oan I have your pup ? ’ was not necessarily
callous or unfraternal. He was simply dominated
by the pup-idea to the exclusion of the brother-
idea. Quite conceivably, in another mood, the
same boy would have given all his belongings or
his life to get his brother out. There are oases
where the egoistic sentiment is obviously charac-
teristic, yet it does not follow that blame can be
even hypothetically attached. Utter unselfish-
ness can no more be expected from the childish
brain than 100yds. in lOsecs. can be expected
from childish legs. Prof. Sully quotes a boy of
three who was told by his mother to stay and
mind a baby-sister while she went downstairs.
On going up again some time after she met him
on the stairs. ‘ Being asked why he had left the
baby, he said there was a bee in the room and he
was afraid he would get stung if he stayed, there.
His mother asked him if he wasn’t afraid his little
sister would get stung. He said “ Yes,’’but added
that if he stayed in the room the bee might sting
them both, and then she would have two to take
care of.’ No charge of want of sympathy lies
against this plausible little self-seeker. He may
fairly plead mental minority. The child is to be
tested by sis own standards, not by adults’,
• » * *
Many such arguments are suggested by Prof.
Sully’s little book, which most people will find
more valuable, because more lucid and less,
baggage-encumbered, than his big book. Possibly,
however, the attempt at a scientific explanation
of children’s ways is itself essentially unscientific.
It sums up with the statement, ‘ The child is
young’—and understanding of that all-compre-
hending youth comes better from examples than
from precepts, from illustrations than from argu-
ments, Prof. Sully’s long chapter on ‘ The Age of
Imagination ’ adds little to Kenneth Grahame’s
picture of Harold the muffin-man, ‘ who day and
night went through passages and up and down
staircases, ringing a noiseless bell and offering
phantom muffins to invisible wayfarers. It sounds

paper by a child artist, aged 7½ .
a poor sort of sport; and yet—to pass along busy
streets of your own building, for ever ringing an
imaginary bell and offering airy muffins of your
own make to a bustling, thronging crowd of your
own creation ! ’ Or how many books of commen-
tary on boys’ ways is Hack Finn worth ? It’s the
old controversy—should one see flowers as a
botanist or as a poet ? But are botanist and poet
mutually exclusive ? Can one not be a little of
both?
THE REASON WHY.
“ When I was at the party,"
Said Betty (aged just four),
A little girl fell off her chair,
Eight down upon the floor;
And ail the other little girls
Began to laugh, but me—
l didn’t laugh a single bit,"
Said Betty seriously.
“ Why not? ” her mother asked her.
Full of delight to find
That Betty—bless her little heart 1—
Had been so sweetly kind.
“ Why didn’t you laugh, darling?
Or don’t you like to tell ? ”
“I didn’t laugh,” said Betty,
“ ’Cause it was me that fell 1”

Dr. GIBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS & SKIN
DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated _ their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, ftc.,
&e., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.

Mr. J. H. WEHR, PARMER,
WASLEYS, S.A. writes“ I can-
not refrain from adding my testi-
monial to your numerous list. In
justice to science, humanity, and
yourselves I must say that your
treatment of sorrowful afflictions is
past all belief. For seventeen years
I have been a sufferer, and four
months ago I went from bad to
worse ; in fact lost all hope of ever
being well again. When I visited
you I was at once placed under a
course of treatment entirely new to
myself, and from the first I was able to attend to my
occupation as farmer. lam happy to state that lam now
well and better than I have been for years, but shall
follow your advice and take the remedies for some time to
do away with all risk. I shall always remain indebted to
you for my wonderful cure.”

ANTHONY BARRY, Castle Inn,
Hindley-street, Adelaide, writes
“I will be glad if you will publish
the following: for the benefit of suf-
ferers. For the last five years I
have been in the West, having:
worked from Lake Darley to the
Horse Shoe Bend in Murchison.
Nearly the whole of the time I have
been a sufferer from Debility,
and loss of energy, always.moping
alone, afraid to join in any
conversation, noises in the ears, and other symp
toms too numerous to mention ; in fact, was a nuisance
to myself and mates. Tried many advertised remedies
without obtaining: any relief. On my way to New Guinea,
and hearing: of so many from the West on their way to
other colonies breaking: their journey at Adelaide to
obtain your treatment, I decided to do the same. lam
g lad to say I now feel fit to continue my journey without
fear, and am sure I have only to take your remedies a
little longer to obtain a thorough cure. lam well known
in all parts of the West, and write this that my mates and
others may know where they can obtain a certain cure.
Mr. M. J. DENAHY, Beryl
Street, Broken Hill, writes
“ Your remedies have acted
like magic in my case, having
been a sufferer for months
from weakness, and through
weakness I was so ill that I
had to give up wor.k, and I
say truthfully I never thought
I "should ever regain mv
strength, as I took so much
medicine before seeing you
and without feeling the
slightest bit better, when
fortunately I met a patient of
yours, Mr. J. Kent, _who
advised me to lose no time,
and, using his own words, he
said: ‘The only chance you
have is to go to Brunswick, Hamilton & Co., who will
very soon put you right,’ and I am thankful I took his
advice, for since I took your remedies 1 am as well andas
strong as ever I was in my life. I cannot thank you suffi-
cient for what you have done for me.”
REMARKABLE CURE OF DEBILITY.
Mr. J. W. AITCHISON, 22 North-st., Adelaide, writes:
—“Gentlemen,—l cannot refrain from adding my testi-
mony to your extraordinary and most marvellous treat-
ment of one of the worst cases of Debility such as mine
was. Since being under your care I can safely say that I
am a strong man once more, and the distressing symptoms
from what I was suffering from have all disappeared in a
most miraculous manner. I had previously been under
the care of five different practitioners for the past four
years ; purchased three different galvanic or electric belts,
without deriving any benefit whatsoever. I had given up
all hope of ever being myself again, when I was recom-
mended to see you. In two weeks’ time I began to feel
improvement, apd your remedies did more for me than
the whole four years’ treatment with.others. I feel as if
I can never thank you enough, and, as I should like other
sufferers to know what you have done for me, make what,
ever use you like of this.*’
JOSEPH MARTIN, Cen
tral Mine, Broken Hill,
writes : “ Accept this tes-
timonial in recognition for
the valuable services you
have rendered me by per-
forming a wonderful cure of
my case, which has been on
me for over five years, and
now that I am well and tell
you that I spent over t'2oo
before consulting you, and
deriving not a farthing’s
worth of benefit from emin-
ent men makes my ease one
that other sufferers should
hear about, so that they can
he treated and cured as I am,
and also made strong, .
healthy, and happy, which I never thought could he done
until I was a short time under your care. I could con-
tinue for months writing of the misery and a,nxiety which
I have suffered, and it makes this testimonial one of great
value, not only to you, but also to those who may be
sufferers like I was, and those that read this and will take
my advice and place their case in your hands will not only
thank you, but also me for making it known to them.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PAPUA DIABOLI.
’Twas late at night, in a dismal camp ; and now
and then in the breeze
A trembling shower of raindrops fell like tears
from the giant trees ;
Above me towered the scrub-clad range, below
was the river-bed;
And I sat and shivered with fever, chills, and
thought of the lonely dead.
A bird flew past like an evil dream, but what
could it bode to me ?
I saw the ghosts of the men who tramped to the
hills, away from the sea.
The distant sound of a native drum rang warn-
ingly through the air,
I heeded not, for I only heard the groans of new
despair.
For one was killed by a poisoned spear, ond one
by a falling tree,
And one was caught in an ebbing tide and drifted
out to the sea;
And one was bushed in the mangrove swamp and
choked in pestilent breath,
And one, poor fellow, was trapped, betrayed, and
cruelly done to death.
Ah, whence we came and whither we went, fierce,
sudden danger was there ;
But most I shudder to think of those who drooped
and died of despair;
Who stumbled onward from day to day, with
ever-lightening load,
But hearts too heavy to carry on, too sick to live
on the road.
A road ? My God ! through an endless scrub, en-
closed in silence and gloom,
We climbed and panted and cursed and prayed
and blundered —into a tomb.
And, cold and hungry and fever-racked, we
camped at night in the rain,
And rose and clambered through moss and mist,
again and again and again.
And so we wandered through days of dread, and
never found that we sought
Till one and the other lay down to die, and we
who buried them thought
With helpless wrath of the day we first set eyes
on that beautiful land,
And loved the light of the morning sun as it shone
on the palm-fringed sand.
The legend tells of a woman fiend in the charm of
her youth so fair
That men would laugh at the warning cry, and
rush and die in her lair.
It seems to me I have seen the face and felt the
kiss of the ghoul
Whom God has clothed in an angel shape and
given a vampire soul.
N.Q.
VON KOTZE.
THE SPLITTER’S SONG.
The long day’s nearly over, and the cool, calm
night’s at hand,
It’s time for givin’ over work, I know ;
Peace is creepin’ down the valley, silence settles
on the land,
The shadows they are length’nin’ down below.
Par away the sun is shinin’ on the eastern head-
land still,
On rugged rocks and sheets of glitterin’ foam ;
Here the wekas ’gin to answer one another from
the hill,
And the wood-splitters are making tracks for
home.
For day is done, and night’s begun,
And dreamless sleep’s a cornin’ !
As the last man stumbles wharewards the more-
porks harshly hoot,
And sleepy mokis rustle in the bush ;
From the tangled mass of lawyer, and supple-jack
and tute,
He hears below the creek’s half-muffled rush;
Now stars begin to twinkle in the clear sky one
by one;
All’s silent save for bleat of mother-sheep
And cry of young lambs answerin’ —with settin’
of the sun
The valley seems to sink in quiet sleep.
And day is done, and night’s begun,
And dreamless sleep’s a-comin’!
There streams a flood of firelight from the open
whare doors ;
The cook’s had supper ready long ago.
Fling the logs upon the hearth till the wooden
chimney roars—
Black pine, e gai-sticks, and matipo !
Supper over, smoke begins; then a yarn, a song
maybe,
The splitter tumbles early into bunk—
Up before the break of day, little time for dreams
has he;
Soon in deepest depths of slumber he is sunk.
For song is sung, and day is done,
And dreamless sleep’s a-comin’!
O my brothers, O my sisters, by the bitter bond of
graft,
By sweat of brow, by salt of scalding tears,
Who seem doomed to travel forward while the
lucky journey aft —
To toil and moil and struggle all the years;
Quiet night comes down at length on the longest
working-day,
And sweet and deep is sleep when grind is past;
There’s a rest at least before us, and the landlord
asks no pay,
For the bed that welcomes weary bones at last!
When day is done, and night’s begun
There’s dreamless sleep a-comin !

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1897.
To Whomsoever It May Concern.
The announcement that the New South
Wales Government intends fighting the next
election on the question of Upper House re-
form—the same question on which it fought
the last election—is another hint that the
dissolution of Parliament is not far off. It
can’t be more than seven months off, in any
case, and it may come much earlier. Under
these circumstances it is about time some
visitant of ability troubled the green scum
that has gathered on the surface of the poli-
tical pool of Siloam, The Ministry’s state-
ment as to the issue on which it intends
contesting the election may or may not be
true—in an exceptional sort of way it pro-
bably is true, as the issue is a nice easy one,
and the cause of the Upper House, which it
is proposed to fight against, is dead already,
which makes it still easier. All that is
needed now is to go out and bang the corpse.
The next question is—on what issue do the
other two parties propose to fight, and what
kind of chance have they? The fact that
Premier Reid proposes to use this old dead
subject over again as the crucial issue shows
his whole-souled contempt for the direct
Opposition ; he simply proposes to promise
his old broken promise once more, with a
blessed conviction that his opponents haven’t
sense enough to offer anything better. And
the Opposition, pegging away dismally at its
one subject-—Protection—has so far fully
justified Reid’s contempt.
* * * *
This steady “pegging away,” as Opposi-
tion leader Lyne himself describes it, is one
of the most pitiable aspects of the case. It
is a slow, heavy, cumbrous, utterly unpro-
gressive siege of the Government’s position
which never gets any “ forrarder.” Yet the
Reid Government is a thing of straw—a
house built of cards—a pyramid upside-
down—an egg balanced on its end, or any-
thing else that symbolises the unstable and
the shoddy. A clever democratic leader
could wipe it oft’ the face of the earth at
next election without turning a hair. The
present Opposition leader—barring his steady
pegging away in a dead fashion at the old
fiscal issue—has announced no programme.
The reason he ascribes is that his pro-
gramme, if prematurely exposed, is liable to
be stolen by the Government. But the ex-
cuse is of the thinnest, for the present
Ministry has never shown itself clever
enough to successfully steal anything. The.
only time it ever stole anything with an
appearance of success was when it assumed
the role of prophet of Federation, and it
hasn't even been able to keep up a decent
pretence of sincerity in the Federal cause.
The very last thing the Reid Ministry would
steal is a vigorous and comprehensive demo-
cratic policy. It has dropped almost every
one of its own democratic views by the road-
side as it went along, and now in its old age
and its Toryism it is only waiting to be
thrown out when the right man comes.
* * * *
There is a wealth of material in New South
Wales out of which to make a vigorous
Liberal policy. The Local Government
idea, which has been dropped every year for
the last quarter-century, and which has just
been dropped again with an even more
destructive thud than usual, is waiting for
some live leader to take it up. So is the
reform of the Upper House, by making it a
paid elective body, chosen by manhood, or
manhood and womanhood suffrage, the
whole province voting as one constituency.
Likewise the province badly wants an effi-
cient scheme for the prevention of deadlocks;
and if both Houses are made equally elective
and equally responsible to the nation the
policy of letting them decide disputed ques-
tions by sitting and voting as one would be a
simple and efficient solution. The abolition of
fees in State schools, thus making education
absolutely free, and the imposition of news-
paper postage —which would about pay for
free-education —are two financial reforms
which the Reid Government assuredly would
not borrow. Another one, which Lvne
could have all to himself if he chose
to take it up, is the passing of an
Act to absolutely prohibit borrowing ex-
cept for directly reproductive works;
the whole system of Premier Reid’s finance
depends on charging huge sums spent on
unreproductive works to loans, and he would
either have, to oppose such a . measure to the
utmost and pose as a spendthrift, or accept
it and have an annual deficiency of a million,
or accept it and go back on Freetrade for
the sake of revenue. Also, there is abundant
room for another Act providing that new
loans, even for reproductive works, shall
bear such a proportion to the increase of
population that the debt per head shall be a
diminishing quantity every year. And that
also is an item which Premier Reid wouldn’t
borrow from anybody’s programme.
* • * *
New South Wales is pre-eminently the
land of huge properties ; much more than
half the freehold area is held in estates of
10,000 acres and upwards, and nearly one-
third in areas of 40,000 acres and upwards.
There is a magnificent opening for a law,
similar to that which has proved so success-
ful in Maoriland, for the compulsory resump-
tion of big estates at an independent valua-
tion and their division into small holdings,
and ever since the Reid Government
dropped this idea so unobtrusively over two
years ago it has been waiting for some
vigorous democrat to take possession of it.
Further, the country wants a graduated land-
tax after the Maoriland plan -which will
further burst up the big estates and the
absentees, in place of the present purely
revenue arrangement which taxes the
agriculturist and the speculator, the
large and small holder, the citizen and
the absentee, all in the same ratio. It wants
a graduated income-tax which will differenti-
ate between the man whose income is derived
from property and the one whose sole means
of support are his. personal earnings. It
wants a probate-duty, quite unlike Premier
Reid’s iniquitous proposal, which will exempt
small estates and give special exemptions to
widows and orphans in poor or very moderate
circumstances. Also it is waiting for some
reliable person to offer it a State Land Bank
after the Victorian and S.A. pattern, since
the Reid Government has defaulted on this
idea along with many others ; likewise a
decent banking law ; a State note-issue ; an
old-age pension scheme ; a State Life Insur-
ance Department ; a plan for the election of
Ministers by Parliament, in place of the
foolish and iniquitous Party-system ; a well-
devised and thorough-going Protective tariff;
and a few other things.
*.* * *
The Bulletin puts this matter to Opposi-
tion-leader Lyne. He has never yet been
Premier, so he is not definitely committed to
any policy. When he was a Minister, he
belonged to a Cabinet which, by abolishing the
plural vote, performed the straightest demo-
cratic action ever done in recent New South
Wales politics, so he can yet claim, if he has
sufficient assurance, to be a Democrat,
hitherto suffering under shameful misrepre-
sentation. He belongs to a party which used
to be the advocate of every Liberal measure
and the opponent of everything Tory, so he
can again claim to be a Democrat, if he has
the awful amount of gall which such a claim
would require. He has so far refused to
advance any policy apart from Protection, so
he can say, if he likes, that his Democratic
instincts have been boiling in concealment
under his shirt-front all this l ime. He has
nothing to gain by his half-hearted alliance
with the Upper House ; the Upper House
has done nothing for him, and never can do
anything for him; besides, the present
Legislative Council will die just as soon as
the Reid majority makes up its mind to
carry out its long-promised reform, and it is
no good being in alliance with a corpse.
Lyive is not young and not known to be
affluent, and he has no earthly prospects of
the Premiership as things are going. But if
he likes to take up in real earnest, from
either good or bad motives, a thoroughly
Democratic policy, and to hire a really
clever “ghost” to prevent him making any
worse blunders than are absolutely neces-
sary, he has still a future before him. He
may hold the Premiership for six consecu-
tive years, and grow rich, and be in
the running for the billet of head of
the Federal State, and have good jobs to
give away to his friends, and go to England
at next Jubilee, and be made a deeply-exe-
crated baronet, and when he is dead he may
have a huge funeral and a statue, and ten
columns of indignant denunciation in the
daily papers, and an obituary in the London
Times stating that he was one of the most
remarkable products of his age.
• • * *
If Lyne doesn’t jump at the vacant situa-
tion, the same offer is open to whomsoever
the matter may concern. The most easily-
won Premiership in the Seven Provinces is
waiting for the clever and aggressive Demo-
crat who likes to rise to the occasion and
grab at the office. Premier Reid can’t go
straight in financial matters ; the immense
sacrifices he has pledged himself to make in
the interests of the Sydney importers have
rendered it impossible through sheer want of
money. And he can’t carry out any big re-
forms through absolute lack of the necessary
constructive ability. The Labor-party, as at
present constituted, has apparently no possible
show of getting into office because it lias no
fiscal policy and no definite financial policy,
and because it is a Labor-party instead of the
all-round Democratic party which the coun-
try requires. So New South Wales, with
almost the most liberal franchise in Australia,
is in the curious situation of being run by a
Government which is three-parts Tory, and
by an Opposition which, according to its re-
cent acts, is all Tory save on the one issue of
Protection. And, with so much waiting to
be done, the next election is to be fought on
the same old lonesome issue which was
threshed to death at the election of 1895,
and nearly to death in 1894. On both these
occasions the matter was practically settled
just the way Reid asked that it should be
settled, and the proposal to pound the
ancient, defunct subject all over again in
1898 is very dispiriting.
A Bank Where the Wild-Cat Grows.
The report of the Parliamentary Investigation
Committee upon the Queensland National Bank
is about the wildest and weirdest financial docu-
ment which ever got into print. It is difficult
to imagine that any other such bank was ever
run outside a comic-opera. Yet the story told
by the committee is put into the mildest pos-
sible language ; and most of the horrors are ex-
pressed in such gentle phrase that it is quite
obvious the investigators desired to make things
as smooth as possible for the influential persons
concerned. Also, it is an unfinished tale at
the best. The committee acknowledges that it
draws a veil of oblivion over many of the bank’s
huge bad debts on the ground that they were
merely the result of imprudence and bad bank-
ing and general foolishness. This is the only
place in which the report seems to infer that
the losses it does particularise were the result
of something worse than imprudence or foolish-
ness or bad banking. On the face of things,
many of them range from crime to idiocy, and
the mild-mannered committee evidently felt
that they did, though it didn’t like to say so.
* * * *
The Q.N. Bank was apparently an institu-
tion which ran itself. The doors were left
open, and the winds blew overdrafts out and
bad debts in very much as they listed. And
the manager did what he darned well pleased,
and the directors did what the manager told
them to do, and the auditors did more or less
likewise, and the subordinate officials never
kicked, and the business was mostly run by
the office-cat. When the manager died he had
an overdraft of about .£68,000, of which £46,000
is lost and irrecoverable. Two directors didn’t
know of the existence of this huge bad debt,
and the third one knew of it but thinks that
he thought the other two directors had autho-
rised it when he was out—or something of the
sort. The committee, therefore, concludes
that the Man Who Is Dead “made large
advances to himself without the sanction of the
board ” —his employers. In ordinary commer-
cial life, when a man makes advances to himself
out of the cash without the sanction of his
employers, it is generally called plain embezzle-
ment, but banking has a code of ethics of its
own. Thomas MTlwraith, the Gentleman
Who Is Away, owed the bank, in June, 1896,
£251,000, of which £190,000 was covered by no
security. Also he seems to have been respon-
sible for £77,000 of losses apart from the above,
and to have had eight overdrafts altogether,
and to have received a present of £lO,OOO
under certain very incomprehensible circum-
stances. The board claims that it had no idea at
all that MTlwraith owed anything like this
sum, so between Drury and MTlwraith— the
Man That’s Dead and the Gentleman Who is
Away—one-half the capital seems to have
stepped out and forgotten to come back with-
out the board noticing its absence. And yet
the board claims to be a sane institution of
good business capacity, and neither blind, deaf
nor senile-
* * * *
The unspeakable dunder-headedness of the
board sticks out everywhere. From November,
1893, to June, 1894, it didn’t even keep an
official record of its own acts, so that it can
hardly tell now for certain what it did or did
not do, or whom it lent money to or how much
it lent, or why it lent the money. The records
from June, 1894, to February, 1895, were
written up from notes, or from memory, or
from somebody’s pencil memoranda, or hiero-
glyphics, or something, well on in 1896, so
whether they are a true record of what the
board did or forgot to do the board doesn’t
really know. And the record seems to be a
false one anyhow, for each meeting’s report
begins by stating that the previous meeting’s
minutes were read and confirmed, whereas six
months’ minutes were apparently confirmed all
in a heap about a year afterwards. The board
apparently didn’t mind this discrepancy in the
least. Among other things, the Q.N. Bank did
a gigantic gamble in Mount Morgan shares, and
by buying at a high price and selling at a low
one it lost <£350,000 —nearly half its capital.
What directors, or directors’ friends, or friends
of the management it might be who thus
passed their loss on to the bank doesn’t appear.
Some person or persons—the report doesn’t say
who—lied so horribly about the solvency of the
bank that this loss was never mentioned in the
balance-sheet, and some other persons—not
specified—were so utterly unfit to be at large
that they never discovered that these other
people were lying. In the case of almost every
big bad debt the board says blankly that it
“ didn’t know.” Some of the things which the
board apparently knew, however, were almost
as shady as a lot of the things it wasn’t aware
of. For instance, when the bank made its last
new issue of shares the public was always per-
mitted to believe that they were all taken up
by outside investors, whereas the Q.N. Bank
took up a lot of them itself; and it bought more
afterwards at a high figure to keep up the
market price, and it is a large holder of its own
utterly useless shares to this day. The
directors admittedly knew of this, and appar-
ently failed to see anything remarkable or ob-
jectionable about it. As one result, the alleged
callable capital was, to all intents and purposes,
a lie, and the people who depended on it as
security were grossly deceived, for the bank
couldn’t strengthen itself in time of need by
calling on itself to pay itself the money which
it owed itself on shares held by itself.

In 1892, it is admitted by one of the directors,
the Queensland Government floated a big loan
“in the interests- of the bank.” In other
words, it borrowed a vast sum on the public
credit, in order to keep the bank afloat.
MTlwraith was the Treasurer who supplied
this money—or Griffith on MTlwkaith’s
guarantee that all was right—and MTl-
wraith seems to have got a lot of it in
personal overdraft, and the directors say
they didn’t know of MTlwraith’s over-
draft—or most of it. Anyhow, the direc-
tors plainly knew, five years ago, that
their bank w-as in great trouble. Yet they
claim that they went on taking the manager’s
assurance for everything, and knowing nothing
about many of the big, disastrous debts,
and apparently they were aware that their
institution was on the rocks, and yet not aware
how it got there, and too tired to find out. It
is claimed that they often asked the manager
for information which he never supplied, so
apparently the board was too utterly weak and
incapable and too great a fool to make its ser-
vant answer its questions. During 1894 and
1895, it is stated, the profit and loss account
was cooked or falsified to the extent of .£71,000
—without the directors’ knowledge and without
the auditors noticing anything very unusual.
The bank was in such a dreadfully tight place
for the last eight years that, in the committee’s
opinion, the payment of dividends should have
been stopped in 1889, but the big, rich, pro-
sperous, acute business men who formed the
directorate never heard about it. One of them
even swears that in 1892—when the insolvent
concern had been paying dividends out of losses
for nearly three years, and when it had to’
bolster up the market price of its shares by
buying them itself on a large scale at a heavy
loss, and the same year when it had to be saved
from collapse by a big State loan—he “had
full confidence in the solvency of the bank.’
As a self-presented certificate of incapacity and
shameful neglect of duty, this statement is
unique.
* * • •
Among the things these astonishing directors
say they didn’t know, the general system of
management w r as one. There was never any
proper method of inspection. One branch, it is
alleged, w'as not inspected for 12 years, though
in that time £BOO,OOO blew out of its open door
in advances and overdrafts. Books containing
a record of the advances stood habitually on the
board-room table, but years rolled on, and the
board apparently never looked at them, and all
it can say about bad debts of £40,000 and
£50,000 and £lOO,OOO and a quarter-million, and
other huge sums, is that it “doesn’t know.”
Even when manager Drury’s policy ended in
the 1893 smash they only went on trusting him
more blindly than ever. Nobody ever appears
to have kicked against The Man That’s Dead.
He suppressed the most awful reports presented
to him by the inspectors, and they let the
matter pass. The local manager at Brisbane
had strong opinions about certain ugly transac-
tions, but “ did not think it his duty to remon-
strate.” The assistant-secretary dul likewise.
The auditors, whose duty it was to supervise
the manager, say that they also saw some weird
doings, but accepted his assurance that all was
right. So the shareholders relied on the direc-
tors, and the directors and the staff and the
auditors relied on the manager, and the manager
pegged out, leaving a personal bad debt of
£46,000 and some £3,000,000 of other losses,
and some of the directors died also, and the
most sensational overdrafter lies low in Ger-
many, and nobody is responsible.
* * * •
As the voice of the late manager can t be
heard from his peaceful residence among the
worms all this tale is, of course, to a great
extent, the ex parte statement of the other
fellow—the great aggregate other fellow. If
Drury had been alive the tale might, or might
not, have read differently. As matters stand,
the old board has either to pose as being, in
whole or in part, a liar and swindler and falsi-


fier of accounts, or as being only a shamefully
foolish and neglectful ass, which was taken in
every day for years by its own servant —and it
accepts the latter role. Probably the role is
the true one, and the inference to be drawn
from it is that the said board, for complete and
unparalleled stupidity, is beyond description.
Also, that it got its fees under false pretences,
inasmuch as it received them for watching over
the shareholders’ interests, and never made a
decent show of watching over anything. As
for the auditors, the only thing to be said about
them is that they were a shade more stupid and
neglectful, and utterly incapable, than the
management; apparently they never saw any
of the large swindles, and, when they came
upon the small ones, they accepted the assur-
ances of the man they were paid to watch and
supervise that all was perfectly right. In
which respect they rank with the detective
who always lets his prisoner go on his personal
assurance that he is a perfectly respectable
member of society. And as for Premier
Nelson, who inspected the utterly bankrupt
and broken concern in 1893, and couldn’t find
anything wrong at all, and gave his personal
assurance that the hopeless derelict was quite
sound, he takes a high place as the prize incap-
able of the crowd.
• * * •
The Bulletin’s plea for a regular State
audit of all banks comes in just here. Of all
the banks which have burst under disgraceful
conditions in Australia during the last few
years—and they run to two dozen or so—there
isn’t one in which the directors didn’t plead
their own blank idiocy, or incapacity, or their
shameful neglect of business, as an excuse. And
there isn’t one, however rotten, which the
auditors didn’t certify as quite sound to the
very last; nor is there, so far as The Bulletin
remembers, one case in which the auditors
didn’t explain afterwards that they relied on
the assurances of the men they were appointed
to supervise, and took tilings on trust, and fell
in. And The Bulletin doesn’t believe there
was one case in which the auditors wouldn’t
have been promptly sacked if they had
attempted to expose anything, for, as a rule,
they are appointed by the votes of the manage-
ment and the directors and their friends and
proxies, and these people don’t appoint them to
make trouble, but rather to keep quiet. The
case of the Q.N.B. is an instance of how the
private auditor can go on for years putting his
respectable autograph to the accounts of an
institution which is insolvent to the extent of
nearly £3,000,000, and never see anything all
that time. And the necessity for strict audit
by an entirely different kind of official,
who isn’t appointed for the express purpose
of never seeing anything, is too conspicuous
to require explanation. Also it seems about
time that other provinces followed the lead of
Victoria by making directors responsible for
something. At present they are not responsible
for anything. And if it is decent justice that
the man who wrecks £5O worth of old ketch by
a minute’s negligence shall be heavily punish-
able there should be some punishment for the
men who wreck about £3,000,000 worth of
property by 10 years’ consistent slumbering
while on duty. According to the most chari-
table view’ of their conduct, the Q.N. Bank
directors never woke up, except to draw their
fees and dividends.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Taxation of Racing Frizes.
Dear Bulletin, —The unfairness of the Vic.
Income-tax Commissioners’ action in levying
upon the stakes won by “ foreign ” horse-
owners at the V.R.C. and other race-meetings
is so obvious that it amounts to a grave scandal.
If the Vic. law sanctions the proceedings, it
practically places Mr. Prout Webb in the
position of a licensed brigand. By no rule of
reasoning can the stakes won at a particular
meeting be said to represent income, a point
which is admitted by even Mr. Webb when he
consents to recognise a claim for expenses as a
set-off against the nominal winnings of a visit-
ing stable. Income, in the ordinary way, re-
presents the annual profit derived from all the
investments, taking one with another, of the
taxed individual; therefore it stands to common
sense that the turf - income of a man
who keeps a stud of horses for racing purposes
is merely the surplus (if any) of business re-
ceipts over expenditure. Every year he pays
away an amount of money on account of the
purchase and, perhaps, the breeding of blood-
stock. Also, he has to charge the business
with training bills, jockeys’ fees, &c., and,
above all, entrance fees. All these items figure
on the debit side of his ledger, whilst he credits
himself with the gross amount of stakes won
plus any receipts from the sale of his blood-
stock. It is not an extraordinary circumstance
for a race-owner in England to be .£lO,OOO out
at the end of a year’s racing which may have
yielded him a few thousands in stakes receipts.
It is usual, rather than otherwise, for an
owner to lose a little by his racing specu-
lations, quite apart from the betting
question. Gains or losses by betting have really
nothing to do with the case of Mr. Prout
Webb’s conscienceless loot. He levied upon
stakes, and for so doing he had no more honest
justification than he could plead for the taxing
of a merchant’s gross profit from one particular
deal in sugar, pig-iron, blankets, or chewing-
gum. Considering that the income-tax is an
old English institution, I am amazed at the
meek submission of N.S.W. “sports” to this
most illogical claim. When a French horse is
taken across the Channel to capture a stake in
the income-tax’s native country, the French
owner is not required to leave a percentage of
his stake-winnings with the British Govern-
ment. To be quite safe in my assertion, let
me say that I’ve never heard of the im-
position being practised, or even suggested.
If there be English precedent for the Prout
Webb policy, then, of course, the vigilant com-
missioner is absolved from all suspicion of
“bluff,” and the Act that he interprets is not
without excuse. But, whether Mr. Webb’s
claim be new and original, or merely an old
English trick, matters not to the bleeding
victims. The tax is shamefully unfair to the
persons chiefly interested. Moreover, it is
a pretty bad thing for the general public,
already suffering enough from the roguery of
horse-owners who would no doubt be much less
dishonest if they had better opportunities to
make money by going straight. The Aus-
tralian Turf is cursed with the poverty —com-
parative poverty—of its “ patrons.” And here
we have Prout Webb making them poorer
than ever.— Touter.
A Pill for Ikey Mo.
Somewhat late in the day the Vic. Racing
Club committee has discovered that something
must be done towards renovating the character
of the Australian Turf, which is now a shock-
ingly fraudulent institution, even by com-
parison with the Turf of ten years ago. The
beautiful Fiemington course—the best-managed
and most attractive show-place of its kind in
the world—was becoming notorious as a happy
hunting, or rather, racing ground for rogues.
No sudden reversal of form seemed too extra-
ordinary for acceptance by the V.R.C. rulers.
Meanwhile, the easy-going Australian people,
instead of asserting their right to decent treat-
ment from the horse-owners who depend upon
their patronage for “added money” in racing
stakes, were content to scramble for crumbs
of disgusting “ information ” re animals
“ on the job ” or “ off it.” But of
late the people have shown a growing indiffer-
ence to “ sport ” conducted on these crooked
lines. Punters of the James White-Donald
Wallace era were converted into mocking
cynics as time went on. To take an interest in
modern racing for the sake of the sport was to
invite ridicule, and nothing can survive a long
continuance of ridicule when its shafts are
pointed with reasonable argument. Something
had to be done by the Fiemington authorities.
They tackled the recent Parthenopreus scandal
feebly in the first instance, but with surpris-
ing determination subsequently, and the re-
sult is most satisfactory. In disqualifying
the horse and its owners for life the
V.R.C. committee has loosened Ikey Mo’s
grip of racing management. Samuel Allen
and Thomas Arnfield were bookmakers—
“distinguished” bookmakers, in the language
of sporting rags. They are now branded with a
conviction for fishy practice as horse-owners, and
the careless racing public will perhaps give a
little thought to the matter of Ikey Mo’s bear-
ing upon turf swindles in general. Australia has
no racing aristocracy to speak of—meaning by
“aristocracy ” a class of wealthy horse enthu-
siasts who, being personally honorable in all
gambling transactions, can afford to make
honesty the best policy for their employes.
Possessing few, very few, unimpeachable
owners, Australia is naturally lacking in
trainers and jockeys of reputation. Where are
there any rich enviable positions open to
men who might become artists in their
respective lines if a big future lay before
them ? The late Mr. James White, and, in
a smaller way, Mr. Donald Wallace had
positions to offer to their employes, conse-
quently their horses were sent “fit” to the
post, and were ridden by the two best jockeys
Australia has known— Tom Hales and Mick
O’Brien. The White and Wallace stables
showed this country how horse-racing could be
conducted—there is little enough of such racing
nowadays. Victoria, in particular, is cursed
by a crowd of ignorant, dissolute stablemen,
not well-versed in any business save roguery.
They are duffers working for duffers, and their
low cunning has brought them mostly into the
meshes of Ikey Mo. Said Ikey was, in fact,
beginning to do pretty well as he pleased with
Victorian racing (not to mention that of other
provinces) when the V.R.C. gave him this Par-
thenopseus pill to swallow.
The Live Relative and the Dead One.
Seven or eight years ago the Gillies Ministry
tried to shelve a great difficulty in the usual
fashion—by appointing a commission to inquire
into the charitable institutions of Victoria. In
those days, it was the fashion to have every-
thing inquired into by a commission, and to
leave it at that. This particular commission
reported that the Victorian charities were in-
sufficient, badly managed, badly supervised,
partially insolvent, and a disgrace generally,
and Gillies then sat down to rest and let
things slide. They had slid for many years
before Duncan got this far, and, until the pre-
sent year, they continued sliding under the
care of Duncan’s successors. Now Turner has
tackled the question with his usual vigor, and
his beastly tendency for doing things threatens
to burst up a useful old war-cry—one that is
almost as old as the Local-Government idea in
N.S. W. Turner’s scheme is short and to the
point. He will give the Vic. charitable insti-
tutions a fresh start by paying off all their over-
drafts, and they are warned to walk a chalk-line
in future and keep clear of further embarras-
ments. The State is to continue its endowment
of .£lOO,OOO a year. A certain proportion of
public house licensing-revenue—about £BOOO a
year will also be given to the cause of
charity/ A tax of 5 per cent, on the
gate - money at out - door sports probably
another £BOOO a year—is to be levied for
the same good purpose, if anybody can find out
how to gather in the money. The charities are
to collect what they can from private persons,
as heretofore, and if these funds are not suffi-
cient a municipal tax of not more than l|d. in
the £—equal to £70,000 a year—may be levied
to fill the gap. In addition to all this, large
powers are conferred on the Board wdiich is to
administer the fund to compel the relatives of
the sick, senile, and disabled to contribute
towards their support—and it is just here that
the one illogical feature of the case comes in.
The powers granted in this direction are very
extensive —so much so, as one Melbourne paper
points out, that part of the earnings of the
humble servant-girl may be annexed to help
maintain her brother, whose only occupation is
that of belonging to a “ push,” while he is re-
covering from a broken arm received while
fighting with a fellow-drunk or kicking at a
policeman. Also the man with 30s. a week and
five young children to maintain may be called
upon to contribute towards the repair of the
small family’s disreputable uncle who got his
head broken while insulting someone else’s wife.
Yet in Victoria, as in the other Australias, the
law still recognises the alleged “right” of
everybody to leave his property where he
pleases, and to disinherit his wife, son, daughter,
father, mother, brother, sister, and all other
relatives. And the Turner Govt., so far, doesn’t
propose to interfere with this arrangement.
So the old person who has a humble income of
30s. a week from property may be compelled,
while he is alive and really needs the money,
to share it with his disabled son or daughter
or wife—which is logical enough, as these
persons have at least more claim on him
than on strangers. But when he dies and
doesn’t want the money any longer, he may
leave it to any stranger he pleases, and compel
the public to support his disabled relative afore-
said—which isn’t at all logical. When it is
proposed to give such large powers to compel
the live relative to pay up the complete
irresponsibility of the dead relative is an obvious
absurdity.
Everybody’s Girl.
“ Soda-AND-B.” on an enthralling subject:—
Ed. Bulletin, — A Melb. suburban branch of the A.N.A.
invited a discussion on barmaids, the other evening-, and
John Vale, of the Victorian Alliance, came along to pro-
test the awful immorality of Hebe as a class. Vale being
teetotally ignorant of his subject, repeated the ancient
temperance story that “ fresh young girls came from the
country and entered first-class hotels as barmaids. They
soon went on the down-grade, drifting into lower-class
public-houses, then to the streets and the haunts of
Chinese, and finally to the hospital and the grave.”
Vale’s narrative opens with an untruth, as every bar-
loafer will perceive at a glance. The girls at first-class
hotels are, as a rule, matured and full of wisdom
(of a kind) rather than young and fresh. Serving
behind a bar is like other lines of business in
that experience, steadiness and ability go far to-
wards achieving the better class of billets. The
proportion of girls “ ruined ” through constant association
with drinkers and drink is not so vast as Vale likes to
suppose, and many of those who do go utterly to the bad
were very likely to get there even before they faced the
temptations of their new life. The one really great
objection to smiling Hebe’s presence in the social system
is not perceptible to blue-ribbonist Vale. Neither is it
apparent to the habitual frequenters of pubs. Society
suffers less from the demoralisation of barmaids by their
customers than from the harm done to customers through
their friendships, more or less affectionate, with the girl
who hands them the bottle. At the little meeting where Va le
spoke nonsense a certain municipal councillor hit Che mark
when he said “ Some men take a pride in offering disgust-
ing insults to defenceless women behind a bar. A girl in
that position becomes unwomanly owing to her continual
contact with masculine depravity and vice.” All bar-
maids are in that position sometimes—seldom or often as
the case may be —and the most respectable of them are
bound to become unwomanly to some extent. If “good”
girls, they are quite antithetic to Trilby, of whom her
author said that she possessed every female virtue save
the one that played the name part. A “modest” Hebe
conserves the one virtue whilst losing her original respect
for nearly everything else that is admirable in woman.
She practises deception mechanically, she lures
men to drink in a calm, ordinary' way of busi-
ness. She judges all human nature by the nature of
the man she sees oftenest (inevitably a pretty worthless
lot), and by the girls who, working beside her in the bar
business, see life only as she sees it. Because she is a
good woman gone wrong in all her ideas of honor, save
the “ honor’’that Bland Holt’s melodrama heroines are
so fond of referring to, she has a false attraction for cus-
tomers in general. Men who have ever been proof against
the wiles of a mere flimsy, yellow-haired Flossie are apt
to get drawn by this good girl into bar-loafing habits, and
“ unfortunate attachments,” and other phases of foolish-
ness incidental to an honest faith in Everybody’s Girl.
She is unwomanly. The male beast who offers disgusting
insults is to blame, but the other, and more decent,
fellows must pay a penalty’ for his crime.

On Behalf of the Widow.
Here is an interesting item for the considera-
tion of humane people—if the race hasn’t died
out. Last year, N.S. YV. Postmaster-General
Cook estimated that his department was run at
a loss of ,£133,000. It is this deficit which
makes Premier Reid’s new probate duties neces-
sary. A great part of the deficit arises through
carrying N.S.W. newspapers free, and thereby
protecting the newspaper-owning industry at
the expense of the people, and contrary to the
declared policy of the Government, and subsi-
dising the proprietors of wealthy journals at
the public cost, and thus coddling and pauper-
ising these people. Even if the imposition of a
Jd.-postage rate reduced the N.S. W. newspaper
postal circulation to the level of thatfof Victoria,
where postage is charged, it would still yield
£50,000 per annum! And £50,000 would enable
the Government to exempt from probate tax the
widow who is left with £lOOO (equal to from
12s. to 15s. per week), or less, as the sole sup-
port of herself and her family. Especially in
the case of the widow who loses her bread-
winner and her sole source of income, and is
left with about £2OO worth of property, con-
sisting of the cottage and furniture, as the only
resource between her little family and utter
want, it would save the necessity of sel-
ling the parlor sticks to raise the special
tax which Premier Reid proposes to
lay upon her by way of celebrating her
bereavement. And The Bulletin asks Premier
Reid —seeing that he will really be the ghoul
who seizes the widow’s parlor-table for probale-
duty on the cottage and furniture, even if the
actual doing of the dirty work is entrusted to a
deputy-,ghoul—whether he thinks it a fair thing
to tax this kind of widow in order that the
wares of the rich Telegraph, and Herald,
and Evening News, and Star, and Bulletin
proprietaries should be carried free? Unless
George Reid has the soul of a bum-bailiff of
the worst description that question can admit
of only one answer.
+
“Oh, yes; her milk was mixed with that of
others, and distributed around.” Thus a Sydney
suburban dairyman, with reference to a cow
which, when slaughtered, was found to be in-
ternally “ riddled with tuberculous abscesses,”
and which, according to the veterinary-inspec-
tor, must, “ for months before, have presented
a glaring case of disease.” The whole premises,
in fact, had been thus converted into such a
hot-bed of tuberculosis that six other cows had
also to be destroyed, after which, in order that
no chance of carefully disseminating phthisis
might be thrown away, the corrupted carcases
were disposed of to a “ poultry-farmer,” whose
fowls, in company with dogs and cats, were actu-
ally found by the inspector feeding upon the dis-
eased flesh. The danger to human beings through
fowls thus nourished is obvious and direct,
and the dogs and cats, a 3 the health authorities
tranquilly observe, would also probably infect
humanity “through being eaten by pigs”—
which is in itself a truly pleasing consideration.
And—while all that can apparently happen to
a wholesale death-dispenser of this sorb is the
cancellation of his license—we have the aston-
ishing assurance to call ourselves a civilised
community. We hang the man who straight-
forwardly stabs his enemy; we “cancel the
license ” of the creature who, for the sake of gain,
cold-bloodedly decimates a city suburb.
The Westralian Draco who sentenced a couple
of men to 36 lashes and 12 months in irons, for
escaping from Fremantle gaol, was defended in
W.A. Assembly by a member who alleged that
the weapon in use for whipping is “ a mere
plaything.” Slight modifications in the struc-
ture of the lash have been lately made in most
of the gaols of Australia, but the instrument is
far from being “ a plaything.” The cord-tails
are still nine, and the knots on each tail are three,
and the flagellator is as heartless a brute as ever.
By the way, in consequence of certain alterations
having been privately made in a number of
gaols in the weight and texture of this instru-
ment of torture Australian Parliaments should
ask for a full official description of those at
present in use. Originally the British Govern-
ment prescribed the length, weight, and num-
ber of knots which the Australian lash was to
disport, and the early Governors used regularly
to handle the instrument to make sure that the
regulations were complied with. That custom
has fallen into disuse, and the public are
thus entitled to a little light on the current
humors of the Criminal Law departments.
There is some analogy betw'een the absence of
machinery to enable a private member of As-
sembly to have his Bill introduced into the
Council, as noted in these columns lately, and a
condition of things brought to light in England
in 1893 with reference to the subject’s imme-
morial right of petitioning Parliament. It
seems that an individual wished to petition
Parliament to inquire into the alleged unjust
conduct of a Judge, but that members, either
through fear of offending the Judge, or for
social, friendly, or other reasons, refused to
present his petition. He brought an action
against one of them, but lost it, the Court of
Appeal declaring, with bombastic wisdom, that
while undoubtedly every subject had a right to
petition Parliament, yet, although he could only
do so by getting a member to present such peti-
tion, he could not compel any member to do so.
This would equally apply in Australia, and re-
form is needed in this case, as in the private
member’s Bill case alluded to, whenever any
Constitutional Reform Bill is before Australian
Parliaments.
That artful old man, Premier Reid, definitely
announces that he will fight the next N.S.W.
general-election on the question of reform of
the Upper House. The announcement was
made on the same day that he backed down
utterly to the Council over the Land Tax Vali-
dating Bill. Why he wants to fight over
Council reform nobody knows. He fought the
last election upon it, and came back with a big
majority—in fact, nobody really objected to him
reforming the Upper House. Since then, for
years, nobody has tried to prevent him
doing it at any moment, and nobody prevents
him doing it now' —nobody except himself, that
is. There is no person of any account to fight
wdth over the question, unless Premier Reid is
going to have a fierce and blubbery conflict
with himself. Considering that there is really
no objection and no opposition, G.R.’s economy
in saving up this question for a war-cry is very
economical indeed. Meanwdiile, the Opposition
seems to have nothing at all to go upon—except
Protection. Yet a really lovely battle-whoop
is waiting to be taken up by somebody ; the
necessity for a law prohibiting the expenditure
of loan moneys on any save directly reproduc-
tive works. That is the most urgently-needed
reform of the day—and there is no danger of
Premier Reid stealing it, anyhow. That
gaudy spendthrift and bequeather of obligations
to posterity would sooner steal a red-hot stove
and a live death-adder.

Victoria must be beginning to gaze suspiciously
at the “mixed” system of teaching in Slate-
schools and Bible-classes. Not long ago there
w'as the case of a pious warehouseman who
“resisted”—successfully, he said—the giddy
advances of a co-worker in short skirts and
golden hair. More recently the Melbourne
public have feasted on the details of a perjury
charge brought by an ex-State-school master
against a young female colleague. Having been
“sacked” for improper dissipations w'ith the
damsel, he desired to retrieve his precious
character by proving that she swore falsely in
denying that the seduction was on her side.
Magistrate Panton ultimately stopped the
accuser’s revelations by saying: “I have
watched the evidence given by this creature
from beginning to end, and though it is
partly supported by filthy documents he
has given it with such shuffling cun-
ning,” &c. Well, Mr. Panton discharged
the girl on the reasonable supposition that no
jury would convict her to gratify the spite of
the “ creature ”in question. Common sense
always takes a liberal discount from the
“scathing remarks” of any learned Judge or
magistrate in these morality cases, but, all the
same, it seems clear enough that simple division
of the sexes should be introduced into State-
schools. The mixing of ’em is responsible for
some very sad allegations concerning the
wide range of woman’s influence. As, for
instance (in a recent case): — (a) “Witness
said he had found the girl intriguing
with every man she met. He had found
her in the school with the head-teacher once,
after marking the time - book as if they
had left. The teacher was a man of about 60.
At another time the teacher’s son, a lad of 17,
was standing at a table close to Miss . He
could see the boy’s passions were aroused by
the expression of his eye. They went behind 'a
screen to continue the flirtation, out of witness’s
view.”
Gov. Lamington, author some years ago of
several stirring magazine articles on British poli-
tics in the East, is pen-driving w ith similar intent
over certain aspects of Australian development.
His attitude towards British politics and methods
is that of petulant critic.

The “Royal Divorce,” which unrolled its
military splendor at Her Majesty’s on Saturday
night, is.a drama which must be judged mainly by
its pictorial aspect. The two tableaux of Waterloo
can compare, for solid magnificence, with any-
thing else of the kind which Sydney has seen up
to date; and if they do represent Napoleon
raging in the forefront of the battle, when he was
in reality mostly employed holding his anguished
stomach in the background, that sacrifice was
necessary for the sake of effect. The public bad
to see its Napoleon howling in the front rank, else
it would have demanded its money back. If the
picture had been drawn from the other side of the
story, the same public would probably have in-
sisted on seeing George 111. and George IV., and
Wellington, and Pitt (who was dead), and the
Britannia off the back of the bronze penny, all
charging together. Another picture which will
do a great deal to keep the drama alive, and which
even lays over the flaring Waterloo, is the view of
Napoleon doing a lonesome dream, with only the
. sea and the carotty sunset for company, at St.
Helena. By comparison, the retreat from Moscow
falls flat; and the flaming city in the background
—considering that the city had been put out and
became a damp ember some weeks earTh*r, and
that the army was far out of sight of Moscow
before the snow set in—is a gratuitous outrage on
history. Apart from the pictures, the “ Divorce ”
is a series of episodes held together by a very thin
hair of plot. Also the hair straggles off the track
a good deal. There is no record that the old
■ Empress and the new one ever met, or that
Josephineever encountered the baby Kingof Rome.
There is also no record that the divorced Josephine
hung tearfully round the scene of her bygone
. glories, and wouldn’t keep off the grass. No in-
furiated Parisian mob got so far as to attempt to
brain Marie Louise with a knob-kerry when the
news of the great retreat arrived ; and even the
giddy, fluffy, shallow-pated daughter of the Caesars
'was hardly the woman to lie down flat on the
ground, to the serious damage of her pretty frock,
■ and wait peacefully to have her head stepped upon
. by her subjects.
* » * *
The “ Divorce ” is a weep/ drama all
through. The audience gets five distinct views of
Josephine: first, as the broken-hearted woman
who is about to be divorced ; second, when the
new empress calls on her and jeers at her dis-
tresses third, when she drifts, ghost fashion,
round her lost palace and grieves over the King of
Rome who should have been her son but isn’t ;
fourth, when she hovers in suspense around
Jehappes, the day before Waterloo ; and, finally,
when she pleads vainly for permission to accom-
pany her Bonaparte to St. Helena. And it has
five distinct glimpses of Napoleon : when he con-
sents miserably to the divorce ; when he plods
with an icicle hanging from his nose among the
snow, and the dead, and the wolves, getting home
from Moscow; when he is a lost emperor at
Waterloo; then as a prisoner on a British ship;
and, finally, as a dismal spectre on a rock looking
at the sunset. There is not a gleam of happiness
about any of these appearances, and Talley-
rand, dragging an ancient, rheumatic leg
through the story, hovers round like a
cheerless bird of prey and intensifies the gloom.
Still there is a certain tearful vigor about the
drama, and it is a blaze of magnificence all through,
and the three tableaux abovementioned are suf-
ficient in themselves to keep it afloat. Misses Ada
Eerrar and Elliott Page are so convincing that it is
difficult to decide whether the empress who stands
up or the empress who lies down and shrieks is the
better character. As for Napoleon, the author
makes him a strained, high-strung theatrical indi-
vidual, always visibly humping along the vast globe
of his “destiny,” and Julius Knight probably
does hinj as well as circumstances allow. Julius
looks Napoleonic, anyhow. Some other indi-
viduals—especially Atholwood as an innkeeper
with de'irmm tremens —will receive due mention
next week.

Sydney Palace re-opened on Saturday with
“Binks, the Photographer a poor, little, wilted
brown rag of literature which hasn’t even the
merit of being actively and aggressively bad. It
is flat with the deadly flatness of the great African
desert, and hardly one green vegetable of mirth
breaks the sky-line anywhere. An utter want of
purpose pervades it. In the first act old grand-
father Binks is just thinking of taking his bald
and slippered way to bed on a winter night, when
some of his sons and daughters-in-law call in.
Therefore, they sit up and have supper, and drink
bach other’s health, and make dreary speeches of
congratulation. The proceedings have all the
riotous mirth of a tea-meeting, and when the com-
pany separates grandmother Binks goes to bed,
and grandfather Binks sits down to smoke by the
fire and has a dream. In the dream, which fills
up act 11., grandfather Binks goes back 40 years,
and is again a young and dreadfully tattered and
insolvent photographer. And in his vision a
youth and four girls come in to have their tin-type
taken, and the rest of the proceedings are ordinary
song and dance and mash. Finally, just as Binks
proposes to the prettiest girl, his dream vanishes —
or rather, the way things went on Monday night,
a number of men came in behind, and carried
it away in pieces. There was no illusion
about the change. The gas didn’t even turn
down. There was simply an awful pause, and then
the studio of young Binks began to break up and
go off by instalments, some of the instalments
tottering sideways as they started, while voices
could be heard shouting directions among the
ruins ; and the old room, with old Binks sleeping
m the chair beside the dead fire, was visibly and
laboriously dragged on. It wasn’t quite the same
room, for there wasn't time to replace the furni-
ture ; it was a cold, empty apartment with no-
thing in it but a chair, and a piano, and old
slumbering Binks. Then old Binks gave a
shriek and woke up in the early dawn. And at
this opportune moment all the relatives of the
previous night rushed in and informed him that
his grand-daughter had twins, and the curtain
fell.
» * * *
What The Bulletin has worried about
till its head feels like bursting is the
dream of old Binks represented a real episode in
his early life, and grandmother Binks was actually
the girl who came to be photo-ed in tights 40
years before; or whether Binks was merely
dreaming the undigested, irrelevant lobster which
walketh in darkness. It matters very little either
way ; still this paper feels curious. If it was
rfeal it was a very weak episode in the life
of a very stumpy old man. And if it was
mere lobster the present writer reckons he
had a wilder dream himself last week. “ Binks,”
whose life looks as if it would be shorb
and troubled, is supported principally by George
Lauri, Misses Addie Conyers, Marietta Nash, and
Amy Gourlay, also Willie Freear, Watson, and
William Gourlay. The latter is the thinnest man
in the profession, and if ever he takes to journal-
ism, the contributions will blow right through him
when the door is left open. Willie Freear is really
funny once, but the other people, as a rule, take
* Binks ” in a fitting spirit of solemnity.

Rather ancient looks old Grattan Riggs
when you meet him in the street nowadays.
Yet, on the stage the veteran goes through his
part with all the vim of fifteen or twenty years
ago, and on the opening night of the “Irish
Detective ” at Sydney Lyceum he seemed to drop
his years off him like a garment. The “Detec-
tive” is practically all Grattan Riggs. He plays
six characters and himself as well, and all the six
characters are exceedingly well disguised. Some
of them are full of fight, and some are full of beer,
and some are Chinese and full of cat-pie, and most
of them are as full of agility as a bull-ant. As a de-
tective Arthur Tracey is a howling stage-joke, inas-
much as he always tears off his disguise just when it
is most successful, and states who he is, and then
covers his retreat with a gun in one hand and his
false back hair in the other without waiting to
really detect anything. This pleases the gallery a
great deal, though it makes the process of detec-
tion very slow. But as an essay on the versatility
of Grattan Riggs, and his capacity for being seven
different persons, all utterly unlike the other six,
the ancient drama has a great deal to recommend
it. Apart from Riggs, the principal feature
is a shriekingly impossible villain who is a fashion-
able doctor by day, and at night murders
casual strangers for the sake of their loose change,
and casts their remains in the cellar, where the
smell would naturally give him away inside a
month. But the gruesome doctor, and the heroine,
and the lost will, and the bones in the cellar, are
all mere side issues. The real beginning, middle
and end of the drama are Riggs out detecting, dis-
guised as a nigger selling clam soup, and a Chow
dealing in pies, and an old woman trading off
bruised fruit at a great reduction ; and that sur-
prising ancient tows the horror through, and
brings it into dock again about 11.15 quite un-
injured.

“Man to Man,” the drama with the loud
railway-collision in it, arrived at Sydney Royal
too late for notice last week, and left too early for
mention this week. The new Rignold season,
which had no more luck than the old one, closed
on Monday night, and the Royal is again empty.
Harry Rickards runs a jiantomime there at Xmas.
** * *
The Hayters and the loose-legged comedian
are back at Sydney Tivoli, along with a great deal
of musical talent and the “cin.” pictures of the
Melbourne Derby and the two Cups ; so the show
may be considered good value at the money.
There isn’t quite so much pressure of cinemato-
graphe in Sydney as there was a few months ago,
and that harried instrument is getting a chance to
breathe again, as it were.

The new show at Melb. Bijou made a pro-
mising start on Saturday night. The house was
crowded, and the principal items in a long list
of turns ” went off with a bang of superior ap-
probation. Also, the lesser items maintained the
credit of the programme, and put a gilt edge on
the tout ensemble. Comparing the present
popular-priced show at the Bijou with the
variety - entertainment staged by Garner and
Goatcher at the Princess’s this time last
year—*the entertainment that had Knowles for
its central attraction The Bulletin rises to
acknowledge the splendid audacity of Garner’s
management in charging five shillings for a dress-
circle seat. The only business fault to be found
with this Biograph Vaudeville eo.. as a whole,
is the lack of ginger in the mixing, and the
noticeable absence of sheer inanity. It is too good
to be fully appreciated by small boys, or book-
makers on the burst. Miss Lilian Tree, Phil
Newbury, the boy Sherwin, and Sydney Deane
would seem a satisfactory co. if they gave their
turns in a town-hall. Miss Fanny Wentworth
may be bracketted with the conjuror and
the ventriloquist as a clever drawing-room
performance. Alma Grey is a dainty little
make-weight, and the Biograph well, when
Harry Rickards states that he paid £3OOO for the
Australian rights of the Biograph for six months,
he probably doesn’t exaggerate the ease beyond
the limits of theatrical license. The Biograph was
duly honored in this journal a few weeks ago,
likewise all the people who support that worthy
apparatus. Their united efforts appear to have
set a large portion of Melbourne afire, and they
will give eight performances a week, including
matinees on Wednesday and Saturdays, during a
short season.

( At Melb. Royal the latest melodrama is
“Meg the Castaway,” which begins with the un-
doing of a bull pup who chewed a box of matches,
and ends with a happy union between the un-
kempt Castaway and a wealthy amateur trader in
baked potatoes. Miss Maggie Moore imperson-
ates the ragged heroine, whilst Harry Roberts
retires from private life to push a ’tater emporium,
and these two reliable artists are thrown to-
gether by their mutual affection for some-
body s long-lost child - said infant having been
seized as compensation for the damaged dawg.
“ Meg ” is a cheerful, preposterous drama,
full of broad comedy, and sudden lapses into
sentiment and song. The bloom of comparative
novelty has departed from it, and the public
should, as a rule, like “ Meg ” all the better on
that account. A very steep plot is apt to seem
less precipitous at a second time of seeing. To-
night (Thursday) is a great bicycle occasion at the
Royal, under the patronage of the L.V.W. and
other whirling bodies. On Saturday there will be
another revival—of the “Trilby” burlesque, per-
haps. “ Trilby ” wasn’t quite certain at time of
writing, but the advts. will speak for themselves.

“ The French Maid” supplants “The
Gay Parisienne,”at Melb. Princess’s, on Saturday,
and the present admirers of one musical comedy
are preparing to rally round the other. Therefore
m order to place the rush for seats on a firm
financial footing, W. and M. ordained a booking
fee of 2s. 6d. for the first day of opening the box-
plan, after which the booking was to be gratis, as
usual.

Lottie Moore and Bellman, likewise
Charles Dillon and Ivy Scott were last Saturday’s

At Poverty Point.
Dear Bulletin, —Tn a recent note on a big London social
event, whereat were present “Mrs. Ronalds and several
dukes,” “ Cleo ” asked—“ Who is Mrs. Ronalds, any-
how?” Well, she is of much more importance than
several dukes, for she is the best-known and most influen-
tial person in musical and artistic London. Her Sundays
during the season are rushed by leaders-of thought and
fashion ; the Prince of Wales being a regular caller. She
is the great friend of Sir Arthur Sullivan, and is, by somg,
regarded as the real manager of Covent Garden, and
every other great musical haunt. She entertains all the
big managers, and to be allowed to sing, play, or recite
at her house is sure to bring the favored performer a good
engagement She is American-born, cosmopolitan in
training, and “fetching" as Cleopatra. She is 60 in
years, but Under 40 in looks, and has the daring of the
devil—as, for instance, when she went to the Duchess of
Devonshire’s great historic ball last season with bars of
Sir Arthur Sullivan’s music printed on her frock. No one
but a “down-under” exile would ask “Who is Mrs.
Ronalds? ” for she is the world-known manager of London
brains and beaut}'. — Pat.
A bilious Australian writes from London:—“The new
play Dot Boucicault stage-managed at the Court Theatre
called ‘The Children of the King,’ is a failure, or bids
fair to be. It is neither opera nor drama, but a mixture
of both, and has a symphonic orchestral accompaniment
by ‘ Hansel und Gretel’ Humperdinck. One can’t hear
the words for the music, nor the music for the words.
They get at logger-heads with each other, and after a
strong tussle through several acts, are both overthrown.
Hilda Spong is in the caste, but has nothing to do.
Neither has anyone else except the drums and the double
bass and the fiddles. The awful Cissy Loftus (who ‘ imi-
tates ' everyone without anyone knowing precisely
whether it’s Dan Leno or Madame Favier she’s doing, or
someone else) plays the principal girl part.”
Ilaresfoot: “‘The Ticket of Leave Man’ played the
late Melb. Alexandra management off the premises. First
Melb. cast, under Barry Sullivan, of this drama : May
Edwards—Mrs. Heir; Mrs. Willoughby—Mrs. Wooldridge ;
Bob Brierly—Heir; The Tiger— Fitzgerald ; Hawkshaw—
J. R. Greville ; Melter Moss Harwood; Sam Rose
Edouin ; Gibson—R. W. Lawrence ; Maltby—Gladstone ;
Green Jones —Charley Walsh, that is to say, Mr. C. W.
Pugh, who was burnt or frightened out of his Flinders-lane
hostelry, the Hen and Chickens, in the recent Beath-
Schiess fire. Joe Jefferson, too, appeared as Brierly in
Melb. He first acted the part in Hobart, and, mindful of
the hero’s denunciations of ‘ prison taint,’ ‘gaolbirds,’
&e„ was alarmed at the old hands filling the pit. But
they liked it.”
The melodiously-named Syria Lamonte has bad a big
ad. over having to surrender the diamonds bestowed upon
her by a South African worshipper who had come to Eng-
land in the same steamer with her, and was promptly
arrested on a charge of “obtaining.” Syria's jewels, ac-
cording to the police, had been also acquired by her ad-
mirer upon the “ never ” —which was possibly why he was
so liberal in “ paftant pour la Syrie.”
Writes “ Ignoramus” : The “Two Little Vagabonds” is
automatical melodrama, and the only time the plav is
lifted out of Punch-and-Judyism is inthe jealousy scene
in the first act, wherein Titheradge forgets the type of
play, and goes off on his own, and becomes masterful and
convincing. The play is not a play of human interest;
it is a play which must be watched out of the green eyes
of tender years, or else gloated over by eyes w hich are
affected by a stomach full of tripe and onions and arf and
’arf, and pockets full of pea-nuts. Melodrama, to be suc-
cessful, must be realistic, or gory, or loud, or swearful.
And where these things are wanting, and where the tender
sentiment hovers round an attenuated, consumptive boy,
there is little scope for success. One relieving feature in
the “Two Vagabonds,” however, is that there are four
acts, so there is ample opportunity for munching pea-nuts
and taking in a cargo of onjapullenlemnade.
Gov. Brassey’s fancy-dress ball was a gorgeous sugges-
tion for the Firm’s next panto. What a chance for intro-
ducing make-ups of Brassey, Madden, Turner, Isaacs, and
all the faces that have been made familiar to the public
by cartoonists. Hancock as Cromwell, Trenwith as some-
thing else, and if Irving has the hardihood to play
Napoleon, surely lanky Joe Symes can be simulated in
the character of Robespierre.
Dear Bulletin,— Re a recent “ Poverty Point” par. The
first theatre in Adelaide was a wooden structure on North
Terrace. Solomon’s theatre (“ the new theatre”) was
called the Queen’s, and was in Gille’s Arcade, Currie-
street. Opened 11th January, 1841 (under management
of Mr. J. Lazar, Mayor of Adelaide for three successive
years), with “Othello.” Cost of edifice, £10,000.-Siik
Oak.
Melb. : “ Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert (Miss Ada Reeve) go
about accompanied by a nice little daughter. Mr. Gilbert
is a larger and more stalwart man than is palpable from
his skilful make-up, as Mr. Shand’s successor, in the ‘Gay
Parisienne ’ frivolle. Observe how he carries Miss Reeve
off the stage, lying on his arms, like a parcel.”
S.S.: “Have just heard Maggie Moore singing ‘The
Wearing of the Green ’—The Bulletin long ago said the
song, as sung by M.M., was the most dramatic thing to be
heard on the Australian stage—and am convinced that
the popular W'arbler is an arch Fenian and a rebel from
hair-string to shoe-laces. The sorrows ov ould Oireland
must be very real to the singer, who fires off that emo-
tional wail with such soul-searching, heart-lifting senti-
ment, and the iron heel of the base, bloody, and brutal
Sasenaoh is on her patriotic corns all the time. As Maggie
Moore sings it,‘The Wearing of the Green’ is the Irish
‘Marseillaise,’ but with the moaning of a heart-broken
nation taking the place of the spirited audacity of the
song of God in France. When I hear the ‘Marseillaise,’
I see an army marching in a desert, with shining eyes.
When I hear Maggie Moore sing ‘The Wearing of the
Green ’ I see Erin sitting on a grave, bemoaning the slain
and cursing the slayer.”
The young Hambourgs, who left by the Ormuz last
week, had delayed their departure in order to study a
soulful performance by Stoddart’s team. The bovs are
keen on ze sport of all descriptions—despite their long
hair.
Lethbridge Beck, an actor, suicided in London last
month. Any relation to the actor, Phil Beck, who also
killed himself?
Miss Olliffe gets special praise 'for her performance of
the injured mother part in the latest London revival of
“ Two Little Vagabonds.” One critic writes “ The
actress’s rare distinction, striking eloquence of tones and
features, and noteworthy freedom from conventional arti
fice, are as conspicuous as they were in ‘ The Rogues’
Comedy.’ Thanks to the real passion and sincerity of her
acting, the magnificently dramatic third act of this adit liv-
able adaption abates no jot of its wonted elfe'ct, but stili
goes with irresistible Man.” The same notice describes out
old friend Clifton Alderson as “i rtiost unmilitarj'
major.”
A Maoriland paper mentions that “ the Firm ” has err
gaged a Maori adept in native theatricals to train th 6
chorus in an opera to be produced in Sydney at Christmas
time, in which there will be a number of Maori scenes and
dances.
Bourke Street : “ So far, Harry Rickards has not an-
nounced a cinematographe picture of the V.R.C. commit-
tee dealing with Mr. Samuel Allen.”
Jones’s comedy, ‘ The Liars,’ at the Criterion, shares
with Stuart’s Corbett-Fitzsimmons cinematographe fight
at the Aquarium the rush of the London crowds,” writes a
Bulletin correspondent. “ Seats are booked at the former
three weeks ahead ; at the latter yon go and tight your-
self to get in. Two such spectacles of physical and intel-
lectual ‘ slugging ’ are not often on view simultaneously
in the same town.”
Melb.: “Maggie Moore’s recent revival of ‘Arrah-na-
Pogue’ reminds one that Boucicault truly wears better
than any dramatist of the last generation. Indeed, one
may say there are more grey hairs on comparatively re-
cent pieces like the ‘Private Secretary’ and ‘Called
Back’ than on the ‘Colleen Bawn,’ ‘Octoroon,’ or the
ever-fresh ‘ London Assurance.’ Boucy was under-rated.
He took the utmost pains with his dialogue, and his char-
acters had blood in them.”
There «6ems to have been a flavor of maudlin romance
about the Langtry business, after all. The latest yarn is
that Mr. “ Lily ” used to haunt railway-stations where his
wife was expected, dodge away just in time to avoid her,
dodge back to inquire of the officials how she looked, and
then depart in a painful state of weep. In return for
which he gets from her fair hands a large hunk of white
garden-stuff-on his coffin. Moral : There are two sorts
of women with steel-grey eyes. One sort is loaded.
IL ■ Miss Sutherland, the rough-cut, worthy philan-
thropist, hack in Melb., addressed Pastor Edgar’s last
Wesley Church Pleasant Sunday Afternoon. She related
that, when in London a few weeks ago, she received a
free ticket of admission to one of the West End theatres
for a very fashionable matinee in aid of charity. It
puzzled her who could have sent it, and she went out of
curiosity. The check-taker looked up and down her
plain Quaker;,’ garb. “ Dear, dear, you can’t come in
here.” “Why?” “ Why ?—Royalty is to be here.” Just
then the manager came up, and kindly introduced her
through the stage-door to an excellent seat in front. A
young lady who performed sent the ticket. Miss Suther-
land had rescued her, as a ragged little Waif, in the streets
of Melbourne.
Tub Bulletin trusts that the cable-liar speaks truth foh
once in his announcement of a gorgeous success for the
Firm’s comic opera production at the Shaftesbury Theatre.
The combination of Nellie Stewart, Decima Moore, Flor-
ence Young, Tapley and Shazelle ought to be a success,
anyway.
The early decease of the Earl of Egmont, a young man
who used to hang around the London 'alls and “shout"
for the “ stars,” seems to have linked Maoriland to the
British haristocracy. The new Egmont was born at Can-
terbury (M.L.) in 1856. He put in some timeat sea, in the
merchant service, and joined the London Fire Brigade,
from which he rose to the less worrying occupation of
beadle at a town hall. Also, the sassiety historian states
that his lordship married one of Spiers and Pond's bar-
maids.
Here are the ages of distinguished London actors who
still play young men and lovers : Charles Wvndham, 72;
William Terris, the melodrama lover, 55 ; Wiison Barrett,
53; Forbes Robertson, 45 ; Beerbohm Tree, 44 ; George
Alexander, 37; Fred. Terry, 34. As to the leading
actresses who play youthful parts—well, Heaven alone
knows their ages.
“ Water used far too lavishly ” is Colonel
Home’s comment on what little irrigation there is
in N.S.W. But he adds that it is the common
failing of new-chums at the game. Also, the sites
for many artesian bores have been badly chosen-
in the lovv-lying parts, instead of at points where
distribution by gravitation would be possible.
One humorous incident of the big Melb.
fire was the way in which barrels of beer and mis-
cellaneous cages and bottles of other liquor were
run out of the threatened pubs, and coolly planked
down on the steps of St, Paul’s Cathedral for a
giant policeman to watch. Another one was the
lady mid nodings on, who got so scared that she
didn’t wait to dress, but fled up-street in the same
condition. This latter incident is humorous or
pathetic, whichever way you look at it.
Mr. A. B. Paterson writes : “In your last
issue, there was a paragraph to the effect that the
Antipodean magazine was nearly falling through
the other day for want of advertisements to the
publishing guarantors’ minimum. This is a sur-
prising statement to make. It makes it appear as
if the Antipodean had not sufficient financial
backbone to come out unless it got a certain num-
ber of advertisements. This is wholly untrue.
The Antipodean is published by George Robert-
son and Sons, and I am editing it; and tHere is
no publishing guarantors’ minimum; and the
magazine would have come out just the same if it
had no advertisements.”

According to Part XII, of the N.S.W. Statis-
tical Register, just issued, the N.S.W. deficit at 30th
June, 1897, was £2,363,139—the highest figure it has yet
reached. During the past year it increased £63,000. In
other words, the law compelled Premier Reid to pay off
£160,000 of it, which he did with one hand, while he
added on his new deficit of £213,000 with the other.
Seeing that Mr. Reid claims to have had a surplus last
year, this increase in the deficit is an awkward thing to
account for. And if the present Govt, hadn’t converted
about £340,000 of it into permanent debt by taking that
sum out of loan moneys and putting it into revenue the
deficit would now be well on to £3,000,000. Anyhow',
why does the deficit increase when there is a surplus?
* * * *
For the financial year ended 31st March, 1897,
Maoriland added a trifle of £1,280,435 to its public
debt, which is now £6O 13s. 9d. per head. This
wipes out the progress made in the last eight years.
In 1889 the liability was £6O 12s. 2d. for each
white inhabitant. Then, by a process of hard grinding,
the increase of debt was kept so much below the in-
crease of population that in 1894 the liability was only
£57 Bs. lOd. per head. It is now back' at the old
figure ; and though the borrowings nowadays are mostly
for reproductive works, whereas in the old days they were
mainly for works which didn’t pay a cent of interest
and the business was mostly boom swindle pure and
simple, still there is a vast deal too much loan in M.L.
even now. Somehow, no Australasian province can keep
sober more than five years at a time, ahd very few keep
quite sober for 12 months.
• * • •
Maoriland revenue for the quarter ended 30th
September was £1,169,032—£109,000 more than that for
the corresponding.quarter of 1896, and £178,000 more than
the September quarter of ’95. What wouldn’t some im-
pecunious Australian Treasurers, as they sit on the Trea-
sury doorstep on a hot summer afternoon looking to see
if any revenue is coming up the road, and seeing nothing
but a cloud of dust and a dog, give for such a show as
that ?
N * * * *
Old John Boom Forrest, of Westralia, thinks he
sees his way this year to have £3,008,000 revenue and
£3,319,454 expenditure. If this comes, off, the deficit will
be £311,000, which will swallow up the grand accumulated
surplus, all but £4OOO. John further adds that he doesn’t
propose asking avithority for anymore loans at present,
which, seeing that he has already got authority to borrow
five millions, is a striking instance of moderation.

The .£120,000 of Victorian 3 per cent, stock
issued in Melbourne for conversion purposes realised
£lO3 Bs. Id., which is by far the highest price obtained
for any Australian loan up to date. The next best trans-
action of the kind was the N.S.W. 3 per cent, loan floated
in Sydney at £lOO. After that comes the Westralian 3
per cent, stock which sold in London at £99 ss. sd. net.
The fact that the two best records were put up in the
local market is another hard smite to the old superstition
that Australia can’t possibly struggle through without
the aid of English capital.

In the amazing matter of the report on the Q.N.
Bank, part of M’llwraith’s defence is that he and manager
Drury colleagued to do —so-and-so. The Man that’s Dead
and the Gentleman Who Is Away are bad enough singly;
but the Q.N. funds found the combination irresistible.
Queensland National Bank director Arthur
Palmer refused to give evidence on the ground of ill-
health. He was too sick to give evidence ; but he is not
too sick to draw £lOOO a year as President of the Legisla-
tive Council- though he is notoriously unfit to fill the
position.
Ex-director A. B. Webster declared flatly that
Q. Govt, borrowed £600,000 in 1892 on the public security
“in the interest of the bank.” It was “not borrowed to
meet the interest on the public dent.” In 1892 the
Griffilwraith was in full stink, and MTlwraith was
Treasurer. No wonder the Q.N. Bank gave him
£251,461 in overdrafts (saying nothing of other advances),
to meet which there is now security valued at £60,700 1
The credit of the country mortgaged by the Treasurer to
save a private institution, which in return fed the
Treasurer’s overdraft ad lib !
Bank’s total loss, .£3,497,803, on a capital of
£928,000 ! ! 1
One of the strangest samples of opinion in the
great Queensland National Bank revelation is the ex-
planation publicly offered by Chief Justice Psalm Griffith.
Griffith was Premier in 1892. At that time the Q.N.B.
held a large amount of public money payable on demand,
and £600,000 of this was to be drawn out to pay interest
on the public debt. The bank informed the Griffilwraith
Government that it couldn’t produce the money—in
other words, that it was insolvent. Whereupon the
Griffith Ministry borrowed the money from the Bank of
England, and averted the smash. Griffith says that he
takes all the credit of this transaction. The credit (to be
divided among a number of people) pans out thus : The
Government knew the QN.B. to be unable to meet its
engagements in 1892. It kept dark about the matter,
and let the public go on putting its money in the rotten
concern. It left the public’s own money in it. It put a
lot more of the public’s money into it. Two Ministers, in
1893, declared the bank to be perfectly sound, and said
nothing about the 1892 act of insolvency. Quite a lot of
Ministers stood by and said nothing, while the bank con-
tinued to issue balance-sheets showing large profits, and
to declare dividends. Griffith also stood by and said
nothing. The board of directors and the management
knew that the Q.N.B. couldn’t pay its debts as far back as
1892, and they concealed the fact from the shareholders,
and kept on issuing prosperous-looking balance-sheets,
and paying dividends —and they also said nothing. And
Griffith says that he takes all the credit of initiating or
helping on this state of things. He is welcome to the
credit. The Bulletin wouldn’t deprive him of it for the
world. It wouldn’t have such a thing about the house.
The Q.N. Bank committee tries desperately hard
to let that awful business down easily. In 1888 the bank
launched out oh a huge scale; it lent out 2J millions in
- one year, and branch managers were “ advised that ap-
plications for advances would be favorably received m
other words, they were urged to hunt round for bor-
rowers, and not be too particular re the security. The
committee says, in excuse, that “ the money had to be
lent, for interest had to be paid on deposits.’ 15ut it
doesn’t once mention that the Q.N.B. made this necessity
by touting desperately for deposits. The report also
states that there is nothing against the personal character
of the directors. The only thing against them seems to
be that they were utterly neglectful of their business;
that they made the bank take up part of its own new
share issue, and tacitly deceived the public into the belief
that the new issue had all been taken up by outside in-
vestors, thereby presumably giving the shares a fictitious
value ; that they bought the bank’s own shares in the
market to keep up the price, and thereby gave it a bogus
aspect of solidity, evidently intended to deceive some-
body ; that some of them borrowed the bank’s money for
their own uses ; and a lot of other things.

Hunk of great joy from the report of the
Queensland National Bank committee: “The account
(of the Mount Perry Copper Co.) began with a transfer
of £5OO. ... On 19th February, 1883, the overdraft
stood at £4357. . . . Another transfer was made of
£BOB9 from the debit of Thomas MTlwraith to the debit
of the co. . . . The company’s account grew from
year to year until it was transferred to doubtful debt
account in December, 1893. But the Mount Perry Copper
Co. was amalgamated with the Reid’s Creek Gold Mining
Co. . . . The flotation was effected in London, but
the new co. did not take over the liabilities of the Mount
Perry Copper Co.” (it only took over the property and
left the bad debts to the Q.N. Bank) “ and the overdraft
remained. Moreover, the bank never received any scrip
in the new co., and it apparently allowed the Mount
Perry property to pass out of its hands without receiving-
anything whatever in exchange. Further, some consider-
able time afterwards, two cheques were drawn on the old
Mount Perry account by Thomas MTlwraith. One was
for £4OOO and the other £6OOO. ... It would thus
appear that not only did the bank gratuitously surrender
its property, but that it absolutely made a free gift of
£lO,OOO to those who took it.” In the face of these and
many other transactions equally mysterious it is hardly
wonderful that some people are suggesting—well, what is
it natural to suggest under the circumstances ?

On every Queensland National Bank balance-
sheet which The Bulletin has in its possessi on _ an( j they
number a good many—the auditors solemnly declare that
they believe the document to be a true' statement of
affairs “as shown by the books.” Taken literally, these
words mean-as this paper has been pointing out at in-
tervals for years past—that if the books were right the
balance-sheet was right, and if the books were a lie and a
swindle the balance-sheet was exactly the same lie and
swindle. Consider the value of that kind of certificate !
Also of that kind of auditor !

The Q.N. Bank report has roused many one-
time bitter enemies to acknowledge the wisdom of the
Victorian banking law which Turner and Isaacs shoved
through amid the accumulated curses of Pro putty. The
main points of the Victorian law are that it requires
a vast amount of detailed information to be given in the
balance-sheet, and that it fixes a cast-iron responsibility
on directors and auditors—whereas, in other provinces,
directors and auditors can get out of practically all res-
ponsibility simply by pleading that they grossly and
habitually neglected their business. Victoria and Maori-
land were the only provinces which learned anything
from the great,bank-smasb. In N.S.W. an attempt was
made to do something per medium of Dibits’* temporary
Banking Act, but even that has been allowed to lapse,
and the permanent Act which was promised shows no
sign of coming. N.S.W. is now back in the old groove,
and anybody without a penny can call himself a bank,
and issue bank-notes, and run riot in the old way. This
doesn’t matter so very much just now, for in this time of
depression there is no room for bogus banks. But, when
the boom comes again, there is nothing to prevent the
old fraud starting afresh as gaily as ever.

Shortly after his return from Europe, Q.N.B.
Manager Drury—the Man that’s Dead—determined to
utilise a wrinkle he had picked up from Scotland Yard.
So he had a special electric-bell connection made between
the Roma-street police-barracks and the bank’s strong-
room, where all the cash was kept. Whenever that bell
rang the police-officer in charge had special instructions
to immediately communicate with his superior officer;
the S.O. with the Inspector; and the Inspector with
Police-Commissioner Seymour, who would at once advise
Manager Drury—so that, the bank premises having been
surrounded by armed police, the thief or thieves could be
without fail captured and locked up. And that bell
never rang ?

The English, Scottish, and Australian Bank
reports by cable that there is a profit for the 12 months
ended June, 1897, of £10,870. Last year there was a loss
of £27,950, and for 1895 the loss was £16,432, so the pre-
sent year’s results are £38,820 better than those of 1896.
Unless another dry rot sets in, it would seem, therefore,
that the large saving effected by the reduction of deposit
interest at the second (1896) reconstruction has brought
the E.S. and A. Bank back to a state of safety. Apart
from this its business, which isn’t a very large one at the
best, shows signs of improvement. New deposits and
current accounts (£1,396,000) are £268,000 more,than
they were a year ago ; cash on hand (£851,000) is £136,000
better, and £460,000 of reconstructed deposits have been
paid off, or taken in satisfaction of debts, or otherwise
got rid of.
Where the very bad shock comes in is in the
news that another big writing-off of lost capital is essen-
tial. In 1893 the E.S. and A. Bank wrote off £450,000
(half its then paid-up capital), and all its reserves (about
£315,000) went the same road. The bank now sets aside
another £431,550 of capital to cover further depreciation
in the assets, so that this very moderate-sized institution
has now made provision for losses to the extent of
£1,200,000. All the capital and reserves existing before
the 1893 smash have gone overboard, and the E.S. and
A. stands on the same footing in this respect as the Com-
mercial of Australia. Considering that it was supposed
to have been more closely scrutinised in 1893 than any
other bank, and that its soundness was then alleged to be
something simply wonderful, this is hardly the sort of re-
sult which was anticipated. And the profits, after all
the saving effected by a large reduction of deposit in-
terest, are only equal to about 2 per cent, per annum on
the remaining capital—the capital which is alleged to be
perfectly safe and beyond all dispute. Under these cir-
cumstances the prospects of the shareholders—especially
as there is a definite obligation to establish a reserve-
fund before these long-suffering individuals get anything
—seem unspeakably poor. And if, by any chance, the
1897 writing-off proves no more final than the 1893 one
did, and some other painful accident happens about
1901

The Bank of New South Wales has a profit of
£89,462 to show for the half-year ended 30th September,
as compared with £87,898 last half-year and £87,661 at
30th September, 1896. The usual 9 per cent, dividend
absorbs £87,750, leaving £1712 to carry forward. Out of
the profit-and-loss balance, £7650 is added to the reserve-
fund, bringing it up to the magnificent figure of £1,200,000.
The B.N.S.W. does the biggest and soundest business in
Australia, but eVen on it the aggravated depression of the
last 12 months is telling seriously. Cash on hand
(£5,307,000) is £1,400,000 less than it was a year ago. In
the same period, note circulation has decreased £15,000 ;
deposits have declined £515,000; bills payable have
dropped £455,000; and. discounts have diminished
£173,000.

The Bank of Australasia has done a trifle better
than usual this half-year. The net profits are £45,375,
while for the last two half-years they were £40,399 and
£40,568 respectively. The ordinary 5 per cent, divi-
dend accounts for £40,000, leaving a balance of £6376
an event which hasn’t happened to the Australasia for
quite a long time. The business looks prosperous in
every respect, still for the past year the Australasia only
earned 3 >4 per cent, on the shareholders’ funds, which is
nothing specially magnificent.
In N.S.W., Victoria, and S.A. the crops, which
looked well up to a lew weeks ago, have gone down
badly. Drought, heat, and high winds struck them
simultaneously. In a great part of Victoria it now
appears that the farmers will get less out, of the ground
than they put into it. In N.S.W., though things are
better, some 2,000,000 bushels have been taken off the
estimated crop in two weeks ; and S.A. is almost as bad
as Victoria. And this is the third bad failure in three
years. Young man, go on the land !

that reached the European market is preserved like that

The Maldon mining-lease scandal, referred to
by Tub Bulletin some weeks ago, only found Parlia-
mentary publicity, in Vic. Leg. Assembly, on 16th inst.
The restrictions placed by the Vic. Premier upon the
scope to be allowed the Select Committee of Enquiry
are most unfavorably commented upon in the best
informed mining circles. Considering that the scandal
has been public property for close on two months, and
that it is known that very powerful influence was
exercised to squash the matter, even before then, there
must be something in the Vic. Premier’s insistence upon
the enquiry not only being limited to the question as to
how Mr. R. B. Stamp got his very valuable and very, early
information, but in his (the Premier’s) restriction as to
the enquiry not being made as a “ hostile move against
the Govt.” Whatever the result of the Select Commit-
tee’s enquiry may be, those “in the know” down South

A pretty frank statement re the Mt. Deddiek

None of the prospecting shafts have gone.deeper than
50ft., and, “as the country is somewhat unsettled, it is
probable that another 50ft. will have to be sunk before
the permanence of the field will be .thoroughly demon-
strated.” Average galena assays reveal lead 7o per cent.,
silver 250 z. per ton ; gold 2dwt. per ton ; copper 1-6 per
cent., but the report is silent as to the quantity of stuff
put to assay thusfar. The Government is cutting a track
from Gippsland Lake Entrance to the Deddiek field, a dis-
tance of 70 miles, and, when the track is completed,
“ about the middle of December,” it should be possible to
raise, cart and treat the ore at a cost of “ not more than
£5 per ton.” This friendly estimate of working exes,
will make Deddiek shareholders very anxious for the per-
manence of the field to be demonstrated. Also, it will
need to be demonstrated beyond any possible doubt what-
ever before the Government will speculate in a Deddiek
railway or tramline at a roughly-estimated cost of
£TOO,UOO.

Victory (Charters Towers) crushed first week of
present month from No. 3 shaft, 116 tons for 5410 z.
* * * *
Charters Towers itemsßrilliant and St.
George paid its.s4th div. on 22nd of Is. per share, totalling
£7200. The recent valuable development sent shares sky-
wards. Victoria and Queen’s latest crushing, 225 tons
for 4540 z. 14dvvt.— £3340, of which £l4OO was profit.
Overdraft now paid off, and a substantial div. expected
before Xmas. Ore haulage for fortnight ended 10th Nov.,
235 tons. Brilliant Block, 351 loz. from 775 tons. -A
big slump occurred in Papuan shares during early days
of present month ; cause, old shareholders throwing sorip
into the market. Shares fell from 16s. 3d. to 11s. 9d. in
three weeks, but on the 12th had recovered, and were
gradually climbing again. Brilliant, from Aug., ’B9
(date of first crushing), to 9th Oct., ’97, crushed 204,671 i
tons for an average of loz. 4dwt. 21gr, per ton ; total
value won, £895,804 12s. Id. ; divs., £416,083 6s. Bd. The
co., at end of Oct., had £5OOO at fixed deposit and ±16,918
11s. 2d. on current account. Very few shares are now
he’d locally, the bulk being Bull’s. Dick Craven, the
lu3'ey prospector, however, sticks like grim death to the
snow that made his pile and to his 50,000 odd shares.
East Mexican (art Adelaide co.) finished a disappointing
crushing on Bth—6oB tons for 3850 z. sdwt. 12gr. Vic-
toria G.M. Association (a Towers-Melbourne co.) cleaned
up 4840 z. from 260 tons on Bth. “-Prospects in Deep
Levels mine are promising. The drive in the right direc-
tion shows the reef to be increasing in size and quality.
• * * *
The Towers has given Bull some good things,
some indifferent, and likewise some dreadful failures.
The New Charters Towers Gold Mines co., which em-
braces nearly the whole of Towers Hill in a tunnelling
area, is not the least of the latter. Bull is evidently get-
ting sick of paying the piper to no purpose, as the co. lately
got three months total exemption. The English investor
is never a good prospector ; he only holds on to his scrip
when divs. are rolling in. When the mine is call-paying
he passes. A strike in this co.’s mine, owing to a certain
little trouble, was heard very little of locally.
• * * *
The testing of the old Burra (S.A.) copper-mine
bottom by a Govt, diamond drill has revived interest in
the less famous Kapurida copper-mine, and an application
for the same help from the Mines Department is talked of.

Another gem from the Coolgardie correspondent
of the Mining Standard :—“ The one great want of Cool-
gardie is an insufficient supply of water for battery pur-
poses.” *
* * * *
Mt. Lyell profit for the half-year, £1(5(5,724,
though the frill plant has only been running two months.
If copper keyps up, and there appears little doubt of it,
the profit of the current half should reach about £lOO,OOO.

COXIETY
S.M. Herald takes pains to say, with re-
gard to “extraordinary rumours about a divorce-
suit said to be pending, that no such suit has, so
far, come under the cognisance of the court
officials.” Which is all very well in its way, but the
mere fact of such rumours having arisen goes to
show that so long as the law is a respecter of per-
sons—so long as it allows privileged people to
obtain divorces privately—even the highest per-
sonages in the community will be liable to the
suspicion of being concerned in scandals which
do not come in the ordinary way under public
observation. The less smoke people see, the
hotter they’ll suspect the fire is. Verily the pri-
vileged.-private-divorce-before-8 a.rn. business has
come home to roost.
Re a recent Bulletin par. The Governor
of a certain Australian prison once lost the key of
his private safe, and sent for an expert burglar
then under his charge to open it. The prisoner,
learning what was required of him, stoutly refused,
on the ground that he was serving a sentence for
picking a safe-lock, and that what he couldn’t do
legally out of gaol he was not going to do in it!
The Governor, being told this, went himself to
interview the recalcitrant confinee, and was horri-
fied to recognise in the ex-burglar a nephew, whom
he had not seen for 12 years !

Extraordinary efforts are being made down
South by Wesleyan parsons to get comely single
ladies for the Chinese mission-field. So far as
The Bulletin can gather, the principal induce-
ments offered are a free passage out to China and
a martyr’s crown in Heaven. No salary is given
for the first 12 months, but the ladies who are
lucky enough to escape the coronation ceremony
during the first year will receive a small yearly
allowance towards the expenses of saving their
vekins. A really “ fat ” job, truly. S

In a recently-published “ Peerage ” occur
these two lines, in succession :
Title. Created. Heir.
Hardwicke ... 1754 ... Viscount Royston
Hare wood ... 1812 ... Viscount Lascelles.
In the early ’4o’s, an individual known as “Vis-
count Lascelles,” who claimed to have been de-
puted by the British Government to enquire into
the condition of the convict-population, swindled a
numberjof persons out West (Molong and Orange).
He was sentenced to seven years. And now the
soi-disant Earl of Hardwicke, who had been stay-
ing in the same district, is before N.S. W. Supreme
Court for alleged false pretences.

Dear Bulletin, —N.S.W. Colonial Secre-

“ pauper ; ” but I would sooner Vie described as a
pauper than an “ object ” —as under :

Despairing of getting people to attend the
old-fashioned church service, W. Maitland
(N.S.W.) Wesleyans got up a sacred orchestra of
20 performers and trained 200 children to sing in
chorus. Now the church isn’t big enough to hold
the crowds that attend the Sunday matinees and
evening concerts. “ Where does the religion
come in ? ” ask troubled ancient hardshells. And
the committee points triumphantly to two new
collection-plates.
The law in its relation to life and “pro-
perty ” respectively. At Wilcannia-(N.S.W.), re-
cently, a man, charged with stealing a ,£5-note,
was committed for trial, and allowed bail in <£2oo
At Clyde, the Coroner committed a man for man-
slaughter, and granted bail—self in =825, and one
surety in <£2s.

The Anglican clergy declined to attend a
Sunday mass-meeting—to which spouters of every
brand were invited—at Wellington (M.L.), in
aid of the Engineers’ Strike Fund. Through
their spiritual head they voiced the fact that
“they had not yet decided which side they
would espouse.” As if there could be a doubt !

N. : “I have exceptional opportunities
for studying Chinese half-castes, especially on the
girl side. No case has come under my observa-
tion in which a legally-married Chinese proved an
unkind husband. But the girly offspring always
grows up with at least a tinge of melancholia.
This is through the cruelty of circumstances. The
Ailivey or orangey young women are educated well
as Australiennes, and will not think of Chinese
for spouses, but their grief is that the young
whites fight so shy. The yellow aroma is not
dirt. The poor girls almost live in the hot bath,
but scrub, break and shatter the vase as you will,
the scent of the rose is over it still.
Dear B., — “The Bulletin wanted a cor.
to explain the other day, if he could, the alleged
‘natural antipathy ’ of the Australian white woman
to the Chow. It isn’t a local failing that there is
no marked antipathy at all. In Safrica (thanks
for that: may we use it this side?) it might,
perhaps, be thought that the Kaffir is treated with
as much contempt by white women as he is by
white men. Nothing of the kind, though ; and
woman’s indiscretion in the matter is responsible
for a good many of the frequent outrages reported
from that quarter, for the Kaffir’s blood is warmei
than the Chow’s, and his methods dissimilar in
other respects.”—P.

Rev. E. Walton, a Tas. delegate to Yic.
Baptist Union, thinks the unions in all the pro-
vinces should have a uniform method of admitting
candidates for orders, so as to keep out of the
ministry mental incapables, wily adventurers,
habitual drunkards, and immoral men of other
descriptions. He proposes that candidates should
be required to pass an educational examination
and supply references as to character. If, as is to
be naturally inferred, this hasn’t hitherto been the
case, much of the milk in the clerical cocoa-nut is
easily accounted for.
To discover the
first flickers of a re-
turn of reason
among single
women-patients in
one of N.S.W.’s
lunatic asylums the
medico gives the
woman, if she can
read, a newspaper
list of advertise-
ments for “a wife.”
If the advt. make
no impression, reas-
on is considered to
be still absent; if
it make her merry
or mad, the prospect
is cheering.

She was slightly
sallow, yet attrac-
tive. She wasn’t his
lawful wife, though
the neighbors knew
her as Mrs. X ,
and, to confirm her
title to the name,
whenever he
brought her pre-
sents she called him
“ her own darling
hubby.” But she
was horribly jeal-
ous, and to “ get at
the rights of things ”
she hired the young
slavey who had lived
with her rival.
“Tell me, Bridget,
about your late mis-
tress. Is she so very
lovely?” “Lor’,
no, marm—she’s yallerer than you.” Then there
was a loud guffaw as Mr. X came into the
room, and the hired girl thought the end of the
world had come.

Ed. Bulletin, —Sydney police vigilance
continues vigorously to wink the other eye. A
small suburban tobacconist was fined the other
day for keeping open upon the very same Sunday
on which I twice bought cigars at night in a city
main-street. Also, in a city oyster-shop I had
stout with my oysters, and about 10 other people
publicly drank beer in the same establishment.
No concealment whatsoever about the matter.
Further, there are in two Sydney main streets at
least 40 gambling-shops in full public blast, into
and out of which flows all day long a perfect tide
of men, women and boys. But the Law can’t see
them. It is looking out too hard for the little
suburban shopkeeper who strikes a desperate
blow at public morality by passing sixpenn’orth of
smoke over an ungodly Sawbath counter. —J,

A sweetly-romantic marriage story was
told in Melb. Divorce-court last week by a deserted
wife. She had been acquainted with her husband
for some years before they got joined in wedlock
by the obliging Kinsman. She paid Revd.
Nathaniel K.’s fee at her husband’s request, and
then the happy pair walked off to the bride’s lodg-
ings. They were now alone together for the first
time as man and wife, and the husband promptly
confessed his anxiety to make a nest for his birdie.
He had seen a suitable villa, and was prepared t<
HE WAS QUITE SATISFIED.
JIM: “ How are yer doing, Bill!”
BILL (with baby) : “ Oh, just holding me own!'
buy it right away—with the bride’s savings. But
she said “No, I will give no man my money.”
Whereupon the bridegroom gathered up his hat
went, and never to return. There was no
cohabitation between the parties, no apparent
love, no “ scene,” no anything beyond a quiet
Kinsman marriage, and a little misunderstanding
as regards Cash. He thought that a woman eager
to get married to a homeless suitor would be wil-
ling to purchase some connubial endearments on ,
his own terms. He was a working tailor, and
snips are good judges of human nature, as a rule.
They sit, and stitch, and think a lot, yet even the
deepest thinker may err in his calculations.
Moreover, the tailor in this case was dealing with
a self-supporting charmer, who, when she found
herself forsaken, sought a billet as barmaid m
Westralia.
SARCASM.
BIOGBILL THE BARMAN: “ Wot! cadgin’ for drinks agen, are yer? If you
don’t take yer hook quick I’ll crack yer jaw with this bloomin’ jug.
Clear!”
THE BEERY: “ Well, blime, Bill, you are sarcastic.”
The Sydney public appears to be slowly
awaking to the fact that it is quite as likely to get
its daily tuberculosis from the poultry-farm as
from the shambles or the dairy. The evil-colored
flesh (and still-more-evil odor after cooking) of the
ordinary shop-fowl is owing to the fact that its
diet has been mostly butcher’s offal and similar
abominations. And “the succulence” of roast
duck brings with it horrible suggestions of the
recently-related Bulletin instance of the man
who, while skinning a defunct Newfoundland
dog, cheerfully informed an inquirer, “Oh, we
just feed such things to the ducks ! ” The trickery
born of throat-cutting competition, in fact, is fast
relieving us of all our beautiful illusions about
“pure country milk ” and “dairy-fed pork” and
“maize-meal ducklings ” and sweet-fleshed pullets
reared in Arcadian innocence of garbage. Even
the blind bliss of ignorance is being taken from us
day by day.

She mounts her
American wheel,
With a hop full of
dexterous grace;
There’s a glimpse of
an ankle and heel,
And a vision of
petticoat lace.
Then she spins down
the road at a
pace,
Quite a modest and
beautiful sight,
Of boldness not even a
trace—
But she pedals in knickers at night l
This secret she’ll sometimes reveal
With the daintiest blush on her face.
“ What responsible functions," you feel
“Devolve upon button and brace!"
In the daytime the skirt is in place,
But, she says, in the uncertain light
It alters the state of the case—
So she pedals in knickers at night.
At a period more mystic
than real,
In a country that borders
on Thrace,
To settle a lover’s appeal
Atalanta once ran in a
race.
Milarion pi evaded in
the chase:
Her form was not up to
his flight—
He might never have
won her embrace
Had she pedalled in
knickers at night.
ENVOY.
Dear lady! Time cannot efface
The vision that haunteth this wight—
Of her, sprinting forth into space,
When she pedalled in knickers at night.

By tilt' south sea silvered in starry sheen
She declared she’d ever be true—
He had recently chewed up a coffee-bean
And devoured a pink cachou ;
And he whispered, “ Dear heart, by the stars above,
“ We’ll taste all the sweets of an Austral love 1 ”
And he sniffed with joy in her warm embrace,
For she gave him back scent for scent—
Her blouse and her bang and her very face
With perfume were redolent;
And she whispered, “Dear hoy, by the stars above,
“ We’ll taste all the sweets of an Austral love ! ”
And the calm, omniscient moon looked on
At the spooning of man and maid,
And she thought with a sigh when the pair had gone
To hide in the ti-tree shade—
“ It’s the old, old story ! By ‘ stars above,’
They’re smelling the sweets of a nostril love ! ”

THE CHIVALROUS MALE.
LEGEND (in both oases): “ 'Urry up, Liza —'ow you women do drag!”
Gov. Brassey, following Excellency Hope-
town’s example, has been “ doing ” the wilds of
Gippsland with a large camp-following consisting
mainly of devoted press representatives and atten-
tive persons with cameras, the latter of whom
hung on to Uncle Tom with dog-like pertinacity,
and “ took him ” whenever opportunity offered.
The heavy weeklies of Melbourne—the sustained
dulness and sameness of whose illustrations make
them as inspiring, week after week, as the passing
of 50-million weary sheep in a narrow way—come
out religiously with pictui-es of Brassey leaning
against a tree, Brassey leaning on a fenoe, Brassey
on a horse in the bush, Brassey on a horse in a
township, Brassey here, there, and everywhere,
doing this, that and the other, but always, always
the same stout, solid, depressing Brassey. Still,
The Bulletin is sorry for his Ex. This compara-
tively harmless old gentleman is hunted through
the country by an army of rapacious cameras so
that he dare not scratch his ear for fear of imperil-
ing the stability of the empire by being made to
appear ridiculous in a public print, whereas a
Butler is simply hanged for his sins.

Governor Brassey, or the young men re-
sponsible for supplying pressmen with the names
of guests at “State” functions, might take a hint
from the procedure at Sydney Govt. House, where
the cards are always made up in alphabetical
■order, whilst typewritten lists are in some cases
got ready for the reporters. The principal worry
is the “sassiety” hen-and-chickens who hand in
three or four of their cards so as to ensure news-
paper mention —and these are just the ladies who
get left out “ by accident,” and who sail round in
a rage next day to demand the instant dismissal of
the scribe.

0. H. Nicolson, P.M., before the Vic. Law
Reform Commission: “I am against whipping
altogether. My experience leads me to the con-
clusion that flogging entirely fails as a corrective
or a deterrent.” But the P.M. recommends in
place of the cat “special dietary treatment.”
Convicts, he said, would rather be flogged, than
put upon low diet. Mr. Nicolson’s reform is not
very drastic after all—he would substitute rats in
the stomach for cat on the back. Certainly his
form of corporal punishment is the most philo-
sophical. Sinfulness goes with a high stomach.
But against this there is the experience of an
intelligent leading Salvationist: “We rarely keep
the converts who come to us with empty stomachs. ”

Apropos of the recent sensational escape

Dear B., — He clergymen acting as adver-
tising mediums for bootmakers, there’s a clock in
Melb. St. Patrick’s Cathedral which bears in bold
characters on its dial the donor’s name and ad-
dress, which suggests a regular bonanza for
poverty-stricken clergymen. To make a church
self-supporting, why not let out the interior to
advertising-agents, and then, during the sermon,
the congregation could inform its mind about
the virtues of Jones’s corn - plaster, Brown’s
Bavarian bolus, and so on. In no place is the
mind in greater need of a little wholesome distrac-
tion than in church, and, as for profanity, we’d
never hear a word about that once the parsons
caught on to the solid oof there is in the business.

The Lucknow police have emerged triumph-
ant from the official investigation into the criminal
charges levelled against them by the peripatetic
Rev. Isitt. Public record of the result of the
investigation is due to the maligned bobbies. But
something more is due. It is understood that one
of them has applied for leave to prosecute Isitt for
defamation, and that his application has been
refused. Why should a public officer who feels he
has been defamed and desires an ordinary citizen’s
form of redress be officially choked into silence ?

The body of a sleeper-cutter named Haw-
thorne, who went amissing some weeks ago, has
just been dug up in the Hutt Valley, Maoriland.
There was the usual bullet-hole in the back of the
head, and the usual mate has been arrested. This
makes the third mate arrested within a year,
Butler and Josh. Beard being the other two. The
property of the deceased, which was only worth a
few pounds in all, is said to have been found in
the mate’s possession. The grave, according b-
the telegraphed report, was too small, and tin,
body showed signs of having been doubled up and
jumped upon to make it fit in. Which is
reminiscent of Butler, who also dug his graves
too small, and had to double up his departed
friend to make him fit in. Joshua Beard was
apparently the only mate who took sufficient time,
and dug his graves large enough, and planted the
deceased in a comfortable attitude. The Bulle-
tin begins to wonder how widespread this mate
business may be. As you go along the roads of
Australia you generally meet the swagman either
singly or in twos —hardly ever in threes. Is the
lone swagman always the mate coming back from
the funeral ?

troversy tears the entrails of the
Wesleyan body here. A con-
spiracy formed by the childless
pastors and the young ones is
attacking what the Old School
regards as the very linch-pin
of the propaganda, the grant of
eight guineas a year to mar-
ried clergymen for every child.
A rev. official particularly
identified with this fund, has
fulminated a circular in which
he maintains that the Wes-
leyans ‘ never will tolerate an
enforced childless ministry,’
and bandies sarcastic expres-
sions like ‘ married celibates ’
and even ‘eunuchs.’ In sooth,
the system is an ecclesiastic
greasery of the fat-back boar
pig, with white round his neck.
The biggest salaried men keep
tacking on these eight guineas
with the persistency that char-
acterises the long-lived pen-

A Bush Lyrist—Will H. Ogilvie.
This is a photograph of Will. H. Ogilvie—
otherwise “ Glenrowan ” —whose many verses pub-
lished in The Bulletin (and presently to be col-
lected in book - form) stamp him equal to the
best of our bush bards. In one of his poems Mr.
Ogilvie charmingly toasts “ fair girls and gray
horses,” and girls and horses are his staple themes.
In verse often finely phrased, and always touched
with tender sentiment, he has embalmed many of
the romantic moods of a bush horseman ; and his
book has a wide popularity assured. Mr. Ogilvie
was born near Kelso, Scotland, in 18C9 ; and came
in ’B9—with all the dreams of tingling twenty hot
in him—to Belalie station, on the Warrego, to gain
“'‘olonial experience.” Thence he travelled to
Maaoupe station (Penola, S.A.) as overseer ; and
then came overland to Bourke. Latterly he has
circulated more or less freely in a district bounded
by the Coorong, Cunnamulla, Coonamble, and
Condobolin—playing the parts of drover, horse-
breaker, rouseabout, and gentleman -at-large. He
has learned to passionately love the Bush—he
always loved a good horse ; and since adult-age he
has had a discriminating regard for the best brands
of Scotch whisky. And here, on the heels of this
notice, comes Mr. Ogilvie’s last poem—
WHEN HORSES ARE SADDLED FOR LOVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
■ The saddle-slaves of Love are vve
Who mount by sun and moon,
No matter what the se son be
So long as it be soon.
The golden and the gray light
Have seen the girth-straps drawn
For love that rules the daylight,
The dark and dusk and dawn.
What hoof-beat on the gravel!
What haste with Love to be 1
What snatching at the snaffle !
What reefing-, head to knee !
Now faster still and faster —
The white moon laughs above —
She knows we have no master
Except the Lord of Love..
The low road keeps the river.
The high road skirts the hill—
No road so short but ever
We find a shorter still ;
And if the floods run blindly
Where love, not life, ’s the loss,
Dame Fortune treats us kindly
And holds our hands across.
The bush-wind blows to meet us
As though she understands,
The hop-bush holds to greet us
A hundred clasping hands ;
There’s not a bird but sings us
A welcome in the grove,
They know ’tis Lov’e that brings us,
And all the world loves Love.
Be skies a-light or leaden
Long miles bring no regret,
And if the white spurs redden
Our horses soon forget;
So toss the bars, my beauty,
And cream the reins with foam ;
It’s ten moon-miles to duty,
And ten more dawn-miles home !
Gleam lights in the verandah,
Flash lamps across the lawn ;
But soft the shadows yonder
Where reins are tightly drawn.
Gut there the dews are glistening,
The leaves are scarcely stirred,
So close the Night-Wind’s listening
To every whispered word.
The moon she dips to morning-,
The lamps are burning low,
Gur love belated scorning—
“ One kiss before I go !”
Now slowly- through the starlight,
Slow, slow, in dreams away,
Till eastward gleams the far light
That leads the breaking day.'
WILL. H. OCILYIE.

BILE BEANS.
WHAT ARE THEY FORT
BILIOUSNESS AND CONSTIPATION.
WHAT DO THEY COST?
WHY, ONLY 9£d. PER BOX
A CURE FOR 9£d.
The modern science of medicine tends to concen-
tration. Bile Beans for Biliousness contain in a
condensed form ingredients that will prove a
genuine specific for all digestive troubles. The
bile is one of the most important factors in the
process of digestion, and defective bile secretion
causes a number of very serious ailments, such as
constipation, piles, diarrhoea, liver trouble, indi-
gestion, headache, &c. A healthy liver secretes
sufficient bile, but when the liver’s action becomes
impaired distressing symptoms immediately fol-
low. These distressing symptoms Bile Beans for
Biliousness cure, not by relieving the effect, but
by getting to the fountain-head—the liver. A
small 9£d. size of the beans is put up to enable
everyone to make a trial of this great specific.
Large boxes are sold for Is. l£d. A trial means a
friend for us. They are a positive cure for indi-
gestion, headache, constipation, piles, pimples,
blotches, and all liver troubles. Obtainable from
all chemists, or the Bile Bean Manufacturing Coy.,
19 Macquarie-place, Sydney. When purchasing,
see that you get Bile Beans, and don’t be put off
with something else.*
A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, November 23, 1897.
Mr Dear Myee—
The Dante Society made its second bid for fame
on Thursday evening, in Y.M.C.A. Hall, when a
feminine and floppy gathering listened to a dis-
course from the fluent Prof. Butler on the ancient
Italian poet whose name patronises the society.
A lengthy excursus on the poems showed that
Dante’s world-renowned imagination broke down
badly in the department of horrors. An ice-cold
Inferno would be a pleasant change of climate
after last week’s scorchers. The President made
a few remarks in Italian, and after the piano had
been undressed, which took some time, there was
a little music. Miss Florence Mack warbled
sweetly, in a white frock.
Last Friday was a night of alarms for the un-
fortunates dwelling within earshot of the theatres.
The railway collision in “Man for Man,” at the
Royal, gave the neighborhood its shock all right
and regular at about 9.30. A while later, volleys
of musketry sounding through the stilly night
announced that the Indians in the wild and woolly
West at the Lyceum were having their little
funeral for the last time during the run of the
“Prairie King.” These crashes were ordinary
alarms, but about midnight loud and unexpected
explosions aroused sleepers, with the idea that the
comet had struck the earth at last. But it was
only a belated rehearsal of the “ Royal Divorce,”
and they were testing the cannon of Waterloo.
Smart drapery windows are very gay with
colored hosiery. After a long reign of black, in
which everything fanciful was tabooed except a
tiny pin’s-head dab of color, or a kind of meat-
safe ventilation about the ankles, stockings now
look like the flags of all nations, and the correctly-
dressed woman can’t have them too gay. Tartan
hose are worn by daring young persons who like
to revel in the newest styles; but the most popular
stocking of the moment has a black foundation
and any amount of gaudy pattern on it. Colored
shoes demand the same hue in hosiery. Men’s
shoe-shop windows exhibit green leather boots,
but up to now I haven’t seen the man courageous
enough to sport a pair. To match this freak of
fashion, a bilious hue is thrown over men’s mercery
generally ; verdant socks and shirts and under-
garments now ornament nearly all the toney win-
dows. It is the bicycle that has resuscitated
gaily-colored hose. They're so much more seen
now.
The d.c. on the first night of the “Royal
Divorce” was crowded and fussy and frilly and
behind-time, and subsided into its seats with much
pomp and flutter and cackle; so it was a tho-
roughly high-toned audience. There was a fringe
hanging by its elbows to the back-ledge of the
circle, and stalls were reserved to the remotest
corners. The “ Divorce ”is a seasonable topic to
stage just now. The stage-folk, like tactless
callers who will talk about ropes to the family of
a hanged man, would keep harping on the subject.
Many bejewelled hands must have itched to spank
the little King of Rome when he artlessly asked
“What is divorce?” There was a “sensation”
at the Question, as if the d.c. were going to rise in
a body and enlighten his young mind. A shortly-
to-be-wed couple, Mr. Brunton and Miss Thorne,
were in the front seats, near a fair matron about
to depart for ’Ome, who has had as many “ farewell
appearances ” as a hungering pro. Mrs. Maes-
more Morris, in white, proved the assertion, often
made, that she looks better off than on the stage.
Miss E. Hughes was barred-in with black over
pink. Gloves were rare. It is the much be-ringed
woman’s day out now, as she gets her chance to
show her jewellery since Mrs. Grundy allowed
gloveless hands at theatres. I
Josephine gets most of the show in the Divorce.
Miss Eerrar trails her oft-described gown with
grace and ease. Julius Nap seems pale and wan
and is quite Napoleonic, even to the little curl in
the middle of his forehead, and lie is so careful of
his pose that he doesn’t remove his hand from his
chest even when he hugs Josephine. And the
hugs seem merely official. All the kissing in the
piece—there isn’t much—is loud and smacking.
Stage-kissing— i.e. , make-believe—always is noisy;
m real life nobody ever kisses with a sounding
bang. Miss Ferrar’s most realistic clothes are her
out-door suit of velvet, with a quaint grey hat
like an upside-down saucepan gushing feathers
at one side. Miss L. Raymond gets inside her
last-century dresses very convincingly, especially
her redmgote with plentiful fur-trimmings of
wile rabby.” Gaston Mervale lurks between
high bottle-green collars, and mutters about “ the
Emprah. . Elliott-Page, as the commonplace
Mane Louise, underacts consistently, just as the
original did. The Hapsburg lady never rose to
the occasion once. Josephine, though not born in
the purple, was fitted in the role of Empress
down to the ground.” The second Mrs. Bona-
parte had the chance of filling the eyes of Europe
as the fallen eagle’s widow. Instead, she married
an insignificant German person, and filled her
nursery with a large, stolid family, and was
stodgily happy and comfortable.
Napoleon’s young son, in the play, is correctly
clad m the garb of the period-a heavy velvet
frock with a raised pie of the same on his cork-
screw curls for a hat.« He looks like Tommy Good-
boy or a Maria Edgeworth hero. Compare the
construction of toggery of the “ Harry and Lucy ”
era with the easy breezy overalls and man-o’-war
suits of to-day. Wasn’t it in “ The Purple Jar ”
that, the priggish papa reproved his little daughter
for showing her ankles when she tumbled dovvn-
stairs Her ankles ! And now youngsters are
taught skirt-dancmg, and proud parents in the
stalls delightedly watch their darlings high-kick-
lng on the stage. And clothes are free and flow-
ing to match. The “Fauntleroy ” adjuncts of
wide sash-ribbon, flowing curls, and eavalierish
nop-hat till the eye much more picturesquely than
th» child-clothing of the First Empire.
Influences of Cora Urquharfc P. are traceable in
the garmenture of the new Rignold leading lady,
Miss Lilian Wheeler, who is tall and fair, but
stoops and totters somewhat on the boards. It
would do the persecuted heroines of melodrama
all the good in the world to put them through.a
dacily course of goose-step drill. In “ Man to
Man’’Miss W. looked willowy in her wedding-
dress of white, cut low, and topped by a vast
bridal-canopy-like hat. She was most I’otteresque
in her wingy black cape and large hat. As a
beauty, she will never come to the front rank till
she gets her hair right. She hasn’t got it to quite
the correct shade yet—her “ Man to Man ” wig
was too dead. A gleam of copper must warm the
fashionable stage coiffure of tho moment. The
late season at the Royal brought forward two or
three personable stage-struck damsels, who flut-
tered behind the footlights briefly and prettily as
“ bridesmaids ” and other accessories, and then
retired disappointedly into private lifo again.
Towards the end of their show, the Society of
Artists gave a swagger evening party to all the
political big-wigs, with music and an elabo-
rate supper. And alas ! when the art vote came
on for discussion in the House it was early morn,
and most members slumbered and slept on the
benches, and the vote wasn’t “ split ” between the
rival societies as the seceders wished. Either the
supper or the painting was too much for hon.
members, for nothing came of the conversazione.
A musical girly family in Sydney possesses a
cat which they thought a gentleman cat, and
called him “Mark Hambourg ” —“Marky” for
short —until one day “Marky’’ electrified them
by exhibiting a large and healthy family of
kittens. Then, of course, they had to change
pussy’s name. So they fixed on “ Marchesi,’’ and
still call their pet “ Marky ” for short.
The Sydney Brush Club, aged nine years and
six months, is defunct. At Paris House, Nov.
17th, Mr. L. Hopkins delivered an impressive
funeral - oration in the presence of about 50
mourners, and spoke feelingly of the long and
useful life spent by the club. As coroner, he
elicited the fact that the deceased had, some three
years ago, suffered from an acute attack of two
societies, from which it never thoroughly recovered.
Lately it had been despondent, and, as various
papers and acts showed that it was tired of life,
the jury, through their foreman (Souter), returned
a verdict of suicide whilst of unsound mind.
“ liinks, the Photographer,” is a feeble little
play that one would like to write about in a faint
whisper ; loud remark arid crash is out altogether.
The one brilliant idea in it is that Addie Conyers
is cast—though quite irrelevantly—in a part that
enables her t.o show her figure. Addie’s figure is
always a thing of beauty. She also wears a leg-
horn hat which curves satisfactorily under sprays
of geranium. Apart from A. Conyers, the drama
is chiefly domestic, with lucid intervals of accor-
cteon-pleating and sash—yards of sash fluttering
all through Act 11. The ballet is tied up in blue
ribbon, and not a girl in the cast but has a soul-
and-body lashing of some kind. Miss Nash has
slim white shoes and three rampant feathers, and
Amy Gourlay locks neat as a French maid of the
" Oui oui ’’ type. The piece hasn’t much inci-
dent : “ Binks ” has a most uneventful career, the
climax of the play being twins—and even the twins
happen “off.”
Theosophy has put spiritism out of the running
with the soulful of society, who must have a mind-
fad. Spooks, as such, are played out, but they
are now served up in esoteric form, “ another
way, as the cookery books say. A foreign lec-
turer, now in Sydney, used to aid in arranging the
Cissy-and-Geordie visits, but has cropped up again
as a humble disciple at the feet of the masters,”
and preaches mind-cure. Two leading adherents
of the new mode of healing disease by imagining
that you haven’t got it, are the wife and sister of
a daily-paper editor. The craze leaped into popu-
larity with .women soon after the arrival of a
youthful prophet with blue eyes and a fat smile.
1 he betting at one time was six to four on the
chance of a wedding coming off with the above
healer as a bridegroom ; but the lady is now lec-
turing in another province, and backers are doubt-
ful.
Afternoon tea-and-scandal coteries are still
brightened by the mysterious and much-hinted-at
divorce-case involving high and mighty potentates
which obstinately refuses to come on. The topic
has rushed onward like an incoming tide, succes-
sive waves being—first, that there was nothing in
it; next, that there must be something in it ;
then it really is all smoke (what a pity !); lastly’
that the alleged injured husband is coming out
per mail steamer, bristling with writs, and is pre-
pared to blue-paper all scandal-spreaders. This
douche has hosed the spreading flames into oblivion
and now everybody is saying that rumors one and
all owed their origin to a certain spiteful club-
man.
The Govt. House party is scattered abroad. On
Monday Gov. Hampden, accompanied by daughter
Dorothy, Miss K. Darley, and Capt. Fielden
sailed for Maoriland. Aide Sloane-Stanley has
departed for the North, and Capt. and Mrs. Fer-
guson have gone to the country. Lately His Ex.
has looked dejected and worried, and is probably
heartily shaking hands with himself at getting a
prolonged spell. Sad to say, His Excellency is
and has long been a martyr to Job’s prosaic com-
plaint. Her absentee Ex. will not return from
England till vvell on into the autumn. Of all the
family the pair who seem to be having the best
time are Capt. and Mrs. Ferguson;- One of their
great amusements is to go off together for the day
in a buggy with a billy and some books, and have
a restful picnic in some quiet nook. The Darley
vice-regal regime, which is now on, isn’t likely to
rouse local sassiety from its annual summer slum-
bers. C.J. Darley and wife take the deputyship
very seriously, and don’t popularise the billet like
the Vic. over-Acting-Gov. Madden, who, although
he plays to the gallery all the time, always
manages to make things hum socially.
Ranji-worship fell as flat as a game on a dead
wicket. The foreign prince wasn’t taking any
adoration; is said to be engaged at ’Ome, and,
apparently, though Eastern, can’t love more than
one at a time. Fellow travellers of his declare
their shipmate to be cold and coy and given to
reading in quiet corners. He wouldn’t play with
lady-passengers. Altogether, as a sassiety lion he
is a thorough frost.
Fashionable hair-dressing is still aspiring, and
the very latest knob sits fair on top of the
head. It will rejoice possessors of scanty locks
to know that the knob can be built gracefully up
by a series of puffs, separating the back-hair
into strands, twining them into sausage-rolls on
the tvvo fore-fingers. Abundant tresses are coiled
into shape. The absurd little “ tea-cup ’’ handle
ornaments back-hair no more ; it’s not the mode
now to show daylight through the coiffure. Also
the regular ripple undulated by crimping-irons is
breaking up into more natural-looking kinks and
waves. The sleek, alluring, loopy bunch on either
•ear is not a style that caught on here, though it
is a boon to the woman with saddle-flap ears.
T inally, the little curls on the nape of the neck
iolstoi’s pet fascination, are now anathema’
straggling hairs being severely gathered up and
caught with a glittering comb —diamond for
choice.
If the projected Irving-Terry tour to these parts,
hinted at by the two London stars to the jubi-
lating Premiers, should ever come off, somebody
will drop money over the venture. To recoup the
enormous exes, prices will have to be raised, and
most ot the high-price payers will be those who
have already “ clone ” the Lyceum along with St.
Paul's ar.d the Tower and all the other sights of a
trip 'Orne. So that the wealthy can’t be relied on
to fill the d.o. consistently throughout a season.
Irving and Terry haven’t the charm of novelty,
for them. And Australian audiences in general
won’t enthuse over the pair. Irving and Terry
are a purely British institution, and an irreverent
traveller who hints to a Londoner that the idols
aren’t quite as young as they were when they were
younger is frowned at as much as if he had spoken
disrespectful things about the House of Commons,
or declared that the Thames wasn’t as good a river
as the Yarra. But Cornstalk playgoers will pro-
bably see in Irving only an older and stiffer Kyrle
Bellew, and in Ellen Terry—herself, still charm-
ing, but a little the worse for wear. After Toole
and one or two other much-heralded imported
failures, the trumpet of Fame isn’t such an ac-
credited instrument with us as of yore.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ Miss Hathorne, of Sydney, is trying to com
vert Melbourne to the ‘ mental healing,’ and at
the conclusion of one of her lectures the other
night invited her audience to ‘go into Hilence for
ten minutes, holding steadfastly to the thought
that there is a great power for good in the uni-
verse.’ The meeting dropped into silence, and
thought so hard that it became purple in the face,
but nothing happened, which was a great disap-
pointment. I remember a popular evangelist who
visited Ballarat about 18 years ago, and whose
great forte was the efficacy of prayer. lle used
to conclude his meetings by turning down the
1 ighta, and inviting all present to wrestle in silent
prayer, that wickedness might be banished from
the town. But one night, whilst he and his dis-
ciples were in the throes, somebody got away with
the whole of a phenomenal collection. After that
the evangelist was content to pray in the light,
and with one eye open. This story is meant to
convince Miss Hathorne’s audience that it should
be grateful if only for the reason that its hats,
cloaks, and umbrellas were not removed whilst it
was holding steadfastly to its faith.
“At a recent ‘ toney ’ religious fair, a sprink-
ling of dear good creatures had been got in to do
the dull work, and by their staunch dowdiness
leaven the main lump of tine clothes and frivolity.
One of these faithful few, presumedly unversed in
the facial landmarks of local bluebluods, bailed up
a stout intruder at the door of her side-show and
demanded entrance-fee. He pooh-poohed pay-
ment, and introduced himself as the principal
potentate on the premises. His story fell on un-
believing ears, and as the recipient pocketed the
extorted toll, she remarked snortfully that the real
Simon Pure, in similar case, would have handed
over a sovereign at the very least in, proof of his
bona tides. Later on, showing the ‘ Suspect ’to a
friend, she learned, to her horror, that the penny-
wise patriarch, so far from being a wicked story-
teller, had not exaggerated his importance by a
hair-breadth.
“ Lots of tidy little trades turn up these times
for women. Weeks before the Brassey ball,
fashionable dancing-and-deportment-teachers were
busy in the stately homes of Toorak, educating
the elect up to hoops, clouded canes, &c. On the
eventful day dressers had their hands full, acting
in many cases under the superintendance of re-
tired mummers, hardup historical authorities and
suchlike. Lady-hairdressers, too, found business
brisk during race-season. Some of then, had quite
a round of calls to make twice daily to visitors at
fashionable caravanserais.
. The Jonah type of humanity is not yet extinct.
One woman sees out three husbands, and there are
men warranted to precipitate wreck, collision or
fire whenever they go down to the sea in ships.
A family of attractive sisters have been hard on
their respective fiances. Both the elder girls wore
mourning in turn for a bridegroom-elect, carried
off suddenly. When the third saw her best boy
at death s door, she took it as a warning and broke
off the engagement in time to save his life.
‘ Pretty Janet Carmichael—younger sister of
Jennings Carmichael, the bardess—died at Mel-
bourne, the other day, of tvphoid fever. Yerv
like her sister in appearance, Jenny ’ Carmichael
was a bright, vivacious girl and saucy paragraph-
writer, who endeared herself to all her friends,
ohe had been a hospital-nurse at sundry times and
places, and the news of her death drew many tears
from eyes that are not easily affected.
Detective Christie as Svengali was positively
the most obtrusive figure at the Brassey fancy
ball, and everyone asked, ‘Who is it?’ Which,
of course, must have been the object of the modest
masquerader, who proudly displays a photographic
album of his disguises more various than those of
Lauri. And now people are disposed to ask why
the great man has just been so mightily over-
reached in his special department of the Customs.
A suggestion for Governor Brassey : why
does he not, instead of clothing his footmen and
coachmen in brown livery with white facings, rig
them out to suit the climate in white raiment
with brown facings ? The Old Man of the Sea is
fond of his chocolate-cream livery colors. He
would preserve these by adopting this suggestion,
and not make his servants on hot days look like
baked things with patches of white grease on
their collars and cuffs.
“A stranger, strolling into a recent Melb.
oavage Oiub smoke-night, expected the thing as
per invitation, to be a ‘ wild Bohemian night, old
boy, but he found a Supreme Court Judge in the
chair and a, programme of mostly classical music.
Being well up the visitor could not escape until
late, and, whilst in the act of getting away, he
was bailed up by his inviter, who poured out a
torrent of abject apologies, not for the dull
respectability of the ‘ function,’ but for the
presence of three guests in—haw !—morning cos-
f. trust, said the apologist, snorting in
the direction of the ill-attired trio, ‘ I trust you
will accept my assurance that they are not mem-
bets of the club.’ The visitor needed no assurance
on the point. He had seen for himself that the
true Bohemians would never dream of attempting
to be wild and wicked apart from a swallow-tailed
coat.
“ A certain vice-regal household, blessed with
vast private means, has been working its chari-
table and other unavoidable expenditure lately on
a few annual dollars. Two ladies of the family
patronised' a church fancy fair, and, after
making the rounds, the high-toned ‘patronage*
totted up to 2s. (id. for the elder and 3d. for the
younger ! Both loftily sailed out, leaving their
purchases to be sent per carrier, and when the
goods were delivered c.o.d. there was indignation
in Govt. House. Later a missive, on large em-
bossed note-paper, arrived at the bazaar, com-
plaining that the carriage of the purchase hadn’t
been prepaid, and requesting separate receipts for
the sum—two-and-ninepence !
“ Agnes Murphy, the Melb. Paunch penwoman
who went to London, seems to be acting as chief
collector of small items re Australians at ’Ome.
When young Jones, son of the famous Sydney
something or other, gets married to Miss
Smith, of Peckham Rye, the surprising news
is promptly mailed across the ocean by in-
defatigable Agnes. If boomster Mugs be return-
ing to the land of his ill-gotten gold, Agnes
hastily records the fact that Mr. M. is looking
well ; and every time Ada Crossley shakes hands
with a viscount her faithful Murphy takes a note
of the Anglo-Australian event. Also, she pauses
to mention that the viscount has lately quarrelled
with one of his aunts. Among hundreds of little
London societies for the diffusion of paragraphs
concerning its members the Agnes Murphy society
is the only one that places Australians on a plat-
form apart from humanity in general. Itamounts
to an Austral Salon in London. Such great
Occasions as the annual birthday of Miss M., or
her aspiring friend Aimee Moore, are celebrated
with a tea-party, and the names of the distin-
guished visitors find their way into print, if
possible. Australia would know nothing about
many of the brilliant intellects that have gone
’Ome if there were no Murphy to mention their
existence.
“ The unemployed woman begins to turn her
attention to hairdressing. Neat-handed girls
serve a short apprenticeship to the trade, which
includes shampooing, singeing, and traffic in
‘ladies’ own combings,’ a branch of business
hitherto monopolised by the ‘Wandering Jew’
who periodically pesters householders for old clo’,
worn-out store-teeth, greasy novels, and such-like
domestic flotsam and jetsam.
“ Rumor has it that, compared to the domestic
broils of an Australian gubernatorial clan, the
doings of the Kilkenny cats were kitten gambols.
Strong wills and long tongues run in families to the
sorrow and confusion of mild marriage con-
nections. The ‘ nieces of the temple,’ or some
such society of hard-worked young women, sab
round meekly the other day, and listened to the
wisdom of their pretty president—a vice-regal off-
shoot, by the way. ‘Didn’t she talk?’ they
asked one another afterwards. And so she did.
She laid down the law and harangued on the
duties of women, and went on anyhow to girls,
mostly older than herself, who, perforce, practise
more patience, self-restraint, and all the rest of ib
in a week than she gets the chance of doing in a
year. Patience and self-restraint, you know, are
not things that people care to achieve, as a rule,
nor are we born with them. They are thrust
upon us, whether we like them or not.
Yours affectionately,
CLEO.

Scientific authorities are beginning to back
down about their opinion of the revolving ship in-
vented by a Canadian barrister named Knapp.
The vessel consists simply of a huge cylinder, in-
side which the passenger accommodation is so
slung as to remain always vertical, while the
cylinder, by means of paddle-floats, rolls over the
surface at a rate which the inventor asserts will
certainly reach one mile per minute, and possibly
more than two ! Experiments are being conducted
with a model of 110 ft. by 22ft. diameter, but whab
is contemplated is a 750 ft cylinder with 150fb,
diameter, and a capacity of 15,000 tons.

N.S.W. Colonial Secretary Brunker studied
law for three years, but gave up the pursuit to
go auctioneering. When you want to flatter him
say, “Had you stuck to law you would have been
Chief Justice to-day, uncle.”
Newspaper controversies about prosely-
tising the distant heathen receive a peculiar
topical puncture in the fact that a daughter of the
editor of Sydney Mail and a son of the sub-editor
of Sydney Daily Telegraph have just left Aus-
tralia to proselytise the Chinese.
It is stated that Mr. F. W. Haddon, editor
of Melb. Argus for the last 20 years, retires
shortly from that position to join the proprietary.
The editorship will, in all probability, fall to
“ Timotheus ” Willoughby, the suave and oul-
tured political leader-writer of to-day.
Labor-leader M‘Pherson (S.A.) is so ill
that he has resigned every office in connection
with his party. It is unlikely that he will be able
to take any active part in politics again during
this year. At one time it was feared that his
ailments, the result of worry and overwork, would
prove fatal, but he is now slowly recovering.
Speaker Abbott (N.S.W.) has now com-
Sleted seven years in the chair. The record
, peakership was that of W. M. Arnold (’65 to
7'5) Ex-Speakers who still live are Daniel Cooper,
Edmund Par ton and Works-Minister Young—
who will probably have the refusal of the chair
should Abbott go to London as Agent-General.
Michael Davitt, The Bulletin hears from
London, has completed his book on Australia,
dealing with his visit from an observant poli-
tician s and economist s standpoint. He is now
revising the proofs. The book will appear in
December early, and will thus get the start of
Mark l’wain’s book, to be out some time in
January.
The story goes that the fervent loyalty of
a big Australian surgeon was badly damped when
his vice-regal patient subjected his account to a
severe “ taxation,” and fought over each item with
the vigor of a second-hand furniture-dealer. It
was, in fact, only when the man of scalpels talked
law that he managed to get a cheque for the full
amount.
S.A. Assembly now rivals the Council in
the possession of a regular drunk. Unlike the
Upper House toper, however, he manifests his
inebriation in the mildest and most good-tempered
way, although in him, too, excess of liquor brings an
irresistible impulse to take part in debate. Where
the Councillor raves, the Assembly - member
merely drivels.
A Baptist parson, writing to Christchurch
(M.L.) Press, quotes Gov. Kan fur ly as having
called his ancestors “ fearless champions of right ”
in whose footsteps “he desired to tread,” and
wants to know how this aspiration is to be ’recon-

And The Bulletin supposes poor Ranfurly didn’t
even know it was loaded !
A most extraordinary c( ’ncidence. Sun-
day* was ’ ifc is the birthday of
Wm- M Millan, aged 47; John See, aged 46;
Cocky Burns (not known to a year); and G. A.
Lloyd, aged 82. Each has occupied the post of
Treasurer of N.S. Wales. Five other NSW
Treasurers—Dibbs, Bruce Smith, Watson, Long!

J. T. Morton, the big London preserve-
xwwwvvw aS i ’ s ca bled, bequeathed
£500,000 to various chanties. Let it be engraven
on his tomb—“ Morton sold good pickles.” His
Uk o Crosse and Blackwell’s—was a guaran-
tee that you weren t making toxicological experi-
ments upon yourself with the vilely-adulterated
stuff too common in this line of business.
jY*c.. Nick Fitzgerald is urged to write
a biography of O’Shanassy, his father-in-law, to
fife the libels by Duffy. Mr. Fitzgerald’s
nealth is delicate, so that he cannot do much of
nis favorite oratorio, and maybe he might prove
fluent with the pen, being also in a prodigious
rage over Duffy s crowbarring Big John’s Mauso-
leum. The Advocate ought to give O’Shanassy’s
biog. now.
In 1893, when contesting North Brisbane
against Li.lley, M’ll wraith nearly brought down
the Exhibition Building by declaring “ he would
not only sell the public estate to pay the public

debts His overdraft, according to the Queens-
land Committee of Investigation, stands at-some-

Cavan Duffy snobbishly complains in his
current Contemporary article, that an Australian
colonist obtained no “special recognition” when
he was Oine 30 years ago. Yet he tells of social
relations he then had with Carlyle, Robert Brown-
-IPP> Newman, John Stuart Mill, John Forster
Disraeli, etc. What more did the man want ? He
w a s not satisfied, apparently, because dukes and
such things did not ask him to lunch. A man who
wasnot a downright snob would have thought
more of meeting and conversing with such men as
Browning, Mill and Carlyle than of being feted
by a whole peerage.
Ramsay Smith, one of
Kingston’s imported Ade-
laide hospital doctors—the
senior physician—had a de-
lightful moment at an in-
quest on an ether victim the
other day. A post -mcr‘cm
was called for, and, in con-
sequence of a row among
the hospital staff, Dr.
Humphrey Marten, an out-
sider, was invited to make
it. Now Marten, as a very
leading practitioner, is an
antagonist of the Napier-
Smith faction. Dr. Smith
disagreed with Dr. Marten’s
description of the internal
organs, and produced part
of the lungs. Instantly the
coroner asked, “How did
you get that?” This was
Smith’s chance. “As offi-
cer in charge of the post-
mortem room I entered. The
attendant drew my atten-
tion to the fact that Dr.
Marten had forgotten to re-
place the heart, so I had to
open the body to restore
the organ, and then saw
the diseased organ, which it
was my duty, as pathologist
of the institution, to take
charge of.” His enemy had
forgotten to replace the
heart—alj the rest was, in a
way, but “leather and pru-
nella.” *

THE HISHOP OF BALLARAT.
London, Nov. 16.— Dr. Thornton, Bishop of Ballarat,
who is at present in England, has declined three benefices
which have been offered him, not considering them
spheres where he would be specially useful.
The Archbishop of Canterbury’ has just offered Dr
ihornton the vicarage of St. Matthew's, Brixton The

cate health.
How characteristically Anglican ! The Bishop—
and the Bishop’s wife. What a heavy pull the
Pope has!
Frank A. Nankivell, the clever Prahran

six months leave to visit Japan. But Chrysan-
themum land held the impressionable Australian
for two years, during which he drew extensively
for a local Yankee print. Thence to ’Frisco,
where his reputation was made, and thence again
to New York ; he eventually landed on the staff
of Puck, where he is to-day. On his way through,
the Australian interviewed Phil May in London,
and brought out a lorry-load of good-wishes from

GALL IT ENGLISH AND IT’S WELCOME.
Dear Bulletin, —I picked you up this
morning, date Sept. 4, and saw a par. beginning
“ What has become of Willie Wilde ? ” An hour
after, when riding on a bus down King’s-road,
Chelsea, I saw “ Willie ” slouching along the
street—a tall, heavy, clammy-lookingman with a
black beard, and hollow eyes. He must have been
a handsome fellow when young. I had seen him
previously at the Duke of York's School annual-
drill, well-groomed, but sleepy-looking. He lives
m the neighborhood of Chelsea, which contains
also little Haweis, who lives in Dante Rossetti’s
house, Leonard Courtney, of the Telegraph
Ackland(ex-Mimster-of-Education), Arthur Stree-
ton, T. P. O'Connor, Georgina Hogarth (Dickens’
sister-in-law), and yours truly— Cornstalk.
“ EGGS.”
(A well-known Sydney character.)
Theophilus Cooper, of Auckland (M.L.),
who is mentioned for the next Maoriland judgeship,
is a safe man. Commencing as a printer’s-devil,
he became a compositor, educated himself as a bar-
rister, and now, not much over 40, shares with
Stout, Q.C., the leadership of the Maoriland bar.
W. _J. Napier, another Auckland barrister, and
chairman of the local Harbor Board, had even a
more remarkable career.
Died lately, in England, G. C. Boase, the
best-known of Cornish antiquaries, whose
“ Bibliotheca Cornubiensis ” (the joint production
of Boase and W. P. Courtney) is the standard
work on the subject. Boase came to Australia
with the Bendigo gold-rushers in ’54, worked for
a time on the Age, then tried digging near Castle-
maine, afterwards storekeeping and tutoring, and
finally returned to England in ’64.
Late E. R. Drury, the Q.N. Bank s Man
Who’s Dead, bossed everything he was connected
with except Tommy MTlwraith, who bossed him.
Among other things he pretty well bossed the
Queensland Club Committee of his era, and, at
one meeting thereof, he wanted to carry something
or other with a high hand. Most of the committee-
men present acquiesced; but one veteran Ish-
maeliteobjected vehemently—perhaps on principle,
perhaps out of pure cussedness—and remarked :
“ It seems to me that this club is run by its trades-
men. There is So-and-So, the club’s stationer;
there is So-and-So, the club’s grocer ; there is So-
and-So the club’s ginger-beer merchant; there are
So-and-So, and So-and-So, who appear to divide
the club’s whisky and beer account between them ;
and, finally, there is Mr. Drury, who looks after
the club’s overdraft.” Then the roof fell in.
Captain Bickers, who, with his brother,
used to be in the Mauritius and interprovincial
trade (their 8.8. fleet traded all round the coast),
died at Port Adelaide the other day, aged 82.
The younger generation remembers' him only
for his eccentric observations from the bench
—for, living in S. Australia, he was, of course, a
J.P. The old captain was of the same pious cast
of mind as Kipling’s McAndrew; and it landed
him in difficulties with his old partner, David
Bower, still living. Bickers wouldn’t leave port
on the Sawbath, and Bovver wouldn't let the day
be wasted. So they split the difference. Bower,
who managed things ashore, ordered the vessels to
put out; and Bickers, who was the nautical man,
ordered the vessels to anchor when they had
reached a safe distance from the wharfside. But
while steam gave McAndrew a comfortable billet
it simply ruined poor old Bickers, who lost all he
had made in attempting, with his sailing craft to
keep level with the then newly-introduced steam-
coaster.
Dear Bulletin, —In a recent issue (unfor-
tunately I have lost the date) you mention the
case of an old Swedish sailor, at present employed
in a saw-mill, who had been capsized in a ship off
the Brazilian coast. The name is given as “ Loch
Li ley,” but, perhaps, his broken English failed to
pronounce correctly the name of the ship. I think
it must be the “Loch Maree.” She left Geelong
16 or 17 years ago, and was never heard of again,
and, as this time tallies with his statement, I am
confirmed in my belief. As he alleges that’ he is
the only survivor, and is, evidently, reticent over
the occurrence, never having officially reported it,
how would it be possible for me to find out the
truth ? lam somewhat interested, as I served my
apprenticeship in her, and several of my ship-
mates were on board when she vanished into
oblivion.— Shellback. [According to The Bul-
letin's correspondent, the sailor’s name is Arm-
strong and he is in the employ of Messrs Ellis
timber merchants, of Camden Haven N S W
Ed. B.]
With reference to a paragraph in our issue
of October 16, relating to the marriage of Mr.
Muddit Allie, a Hindoo licensed hawker, well and
favorably known in the Moama district of N.S. W.,
The Bulletin learns with regret that certain
statements therein contained are totally incorrect.
As a matter of fact, Mr. Muddit Allie was married
by a Church of England clergyman at Rochester
(Vic.), and his honeymoon was spent at the resi-
dence of a respected citizen of Carlton (Vic.). The
statement regarding police enquiries is quite un-
true- Mr. Muddit Allie has been a resident of
N.b. Wales for upwards of six years, and The
Bulletin is assured that both in business and
privately he bears an irreproachable reputation.

Aboriainalities.
Cork Constitution, of Sept. 24, thus airs
itself, begorra:—
Snakes are commonly to be met with in New South
Wales, and are useful for various purposes. Some make
pets of them, and others whips and missiles. A member
of the Government entered the Legislative Assembly re-
cently with a huge snake coiled round his arm, and took
his seat behind the Treasury bench. Several members
rose to call the Speaker’s attention to the presence of the
objectionable “stranger,” and the offending member
slipped out of the House before the Speaker could bring
him to order. Snakes appear, however, to be gradually
making their way into public life in the parent Australian
colony. A little time ago, at an election meeting, a black
snake was thrown at the candidate, and the meeting
ended with a fight among the electors, who pulled snakes
out of their coat-pockets, and lashed each other with
them.

The Bryen Boiroimhe was the best-kept
local pub., and Mick O’Hagan, the landlord,
aided by his buxom wife, did his level best for his
guests. In a general way, Mick was a mild-
spolcen man and a pattern of politeness, but, at
t.mes, his language was strong —when he started
to instil right principles into his numerous off-
spring, for instance. Early one morning, the
chapel bell was ringing, and Mick was heard, in
sulphurous phrases, bawling to the boys to “ clean
themselves” and be off to mass. “If you call
yourselves blanky blank Christians, why the
blanky blank don’t you attind your religious
duties?” Then Mick came into the breakfast-
room, looking as mild as usual, and, seating him-
self at the head of the table, he solemnly ex-
plained the situation to his waiting guests. ‘ ‘ This
is a great day in our church, gintlemen. It’s
what they call Ash Wednesday—whativer the
divil that manes. Lamb’s fry or pork sausage.

John Smith, to The Bulletin :
Dear Bulletin, — Re Chows in Queensland ; revisiting
recently my native town in that province, I found not
only that by intermarriage I was related to the whole com-
munity, but also, to my dismav, that the Chows had
become largely mixed up in the connection. One big
family of half-bred Chinese owns a large portion of the
town, and, in fact, there are more of these half-yellows in
the place than in Cairns and Thursday Island put together.
And, what is worse, the whites appear to be proud of
their slant-eyed relatives ; in fact, it isn’t safe to say a
word against them, lest one of the family should lay you
out. I think I’m about the only white native of the place
who ever had go enough to leave it, and when I went
back I found I had no chance against the vellow curse
of getting any work. I’m glad I’ve no sin', ere in the
infernal hole, because one almond-eye wanted me to
introduce him to my cousin. “ Welly nicee gel 1” he
thought, so I introduced him to my boot—and k.t 1
The Chow is now much more fashionable than he
used to be. Twenty years ago The Bulletin
knew a young man whose pretty sister in his
SIMPLE WHEN YOU KNOW IT.
GUSSY : “ Haw, what are you doing to that horse’s tail, my man!"
BILL: “ Well, ye see, he’s a bit Highty, an’ I’m just a-goin’ to tie a knot in ’is tail. He might
run through the collar and that knot’ll ketch him, see !”
Gussy : “ Haw, bai Jove, I never knew that before. But it’s nevah too late to learn.”
Absence married an ugly and wealthy Chinaman,
And when some would-be-humorist ventured to en-
quire of that young man concerning the health of
his brother-in-law, the young man broke his jaw
and spread his nose all over his face. It is there
still.

The latest dog-story, this time from far-
back N.S.W. A Gonnulpie Downs station-hand,
M‘Dermot, thrown from his horse, was lying
helpless in that awful wilderness when, with a
rabbit-bone, he scratched a message on his dog’s
collar and sooled the animal off to the station. Of
course the sagacious beast ought to have at once
raced off for help and whined piteously until the
message had been read, when it should have
bounded off ahead of the searchers. But it didn’t
do anything of the kind —it just hung round and
occasionally looked for more rabbit-bones till the
fourth day, when a search-party found the pair.
This, by the way, was M'Dermot’s second experi-
ence of this kind.

Dear Bulletin, Find the bard who
swims and your team of bush-poets will be com-
plete. You have remarked that in “The Banjo ”
you’ve got “ the bard who rides,” and in Henry
Lawson, “ the bard who walks.” I think Will.
H. Ogilvie is obviously the bard who drives—and
drives exceedingly well in his “Dray-Dreams,”
“Phantom Coach,” “Team of Roans,” “Grey
Leader, ” &e., &c. Re, Lawson’s “In the Days
When the World Was Wide,” perhaps it’s late in
t he season, but I’ve got a grievance of which I’d
like to be unburdened. It has much disappointed
me that not one of the book’s legions of town and
country reviewers—including yourself—quoted,
mentioned, or even hinted at what / think Law-
son’s prettiest and most truly characteristic and
graphic bush picture: “When the Army prays
for Watty,” which, next to “The Vagabond,” I
like better than all the rest of Lawson’s verses.—

Said the old battler, sitting on his 801 b.
swag : “ See that bitch there. She’s the best
breed in the country. They’d work anything—a
shearing-machine if you showed ’em how ! Well,
her first litter was by a dog what come of the next
best breed ” (he gave a yard of pedigree with
each); “and the pups! Good? Well, they just
was good. Tell ye how good they was. The day
their eyes opened I was away, and when I come
home, blow me if they wasn’t working all the old
mutton-bones about the place up into a heap, and
her sitten watchen ’em. Didn’t they, old girl ? ”
The old girl wagged an affirmative, and the gang
gazed in silent admiration upon her master as he
buried his nose in the champion pint they imme-
diately ordered for him.
A rather more earnest
effort is being made in
Adelaide than in the other
centres to gather and pre-
serve knowledge of the
disappearing aborigines.
A. T. Magarey, about the
most enthusiastic local in-
vestigator, lectured lately
on “ Black-tracking,” and
Tom Coward assisted.
Magarey mentioned (and
bushmen in the far North
know it to be a fact) that
youngsters are trained by
their mothers, who pub
them to work first on
lizards’ trails. But track-
ing comes natural to them.
A little toddler left in camp,
and losing its mother,
makes a circuit of the wur-
lies till it has picked up
its mother’s marks, and
then unhesitatingly follows
them out. Aj. wformance
vouched for by Mnrif, the
overland cyclist, is hard to
beat. A far-in settler had
three named cats, the same
size, and apparently pos-
sessed of precisely similar
feet. He got the three in
a room (the hut was on a
hard patch, by the way),
and then told Murif, who
had been informed as to
their names, to throw one
of them out—any one. A
few minutes later he called
up a blackfellow attached
to the camp. “ Harry,
one cat got out window.
Which way?” Harry,
though it was already deep
dusk, picked up the track
and’followed it. Then he
was called back. “ Whioh
one cat ? ” “ That Kittie ”
—and Kittie it was.
Ed. Bulletin, — Re the shearing record
lately posted in Bulletin, I don’t know how long
men work in America, but in Australia a shearing
day is nearly nine hours, not eight. Shearers
work 48 hours per week, and in nearly all sheds
cease work at 12 o’clock on Saturday, and to make
the 48 hours work considerably over eight hours
on the other five days.— Flong.

Werrimee : “A question has often puzzled
me. Why do so many men go mad on the
Darling? Perhaps the ‘Spirit of the Plains’ has
stretched its spider-neck along its sun-baked
shores. There one constantly hears such expres-
sions as ‘looney,’ ‘balmy,’ ‘ratty,’ ‘moon-struck,’
and ‘ feather-head ’ (brother of ‘ leather-’ead ’), in-
terspersed with ‘white-ants,’ ‘centipedes,’ and
‘ snakes.’ Further out, when a man is met with
woo is a little more foolish than the usual, they

“ Paddy the Dodger ” on Papuan fever :
Uoar Bullktin, The ‘‘white ants” must be getting
hold of “ Scotty, ’ or he couldn’t have said that Southern
well-fed and blooded men can stand climates like Papua
better than N. Queenslanders. Twelvemonths’ residence
on Woodlark Island enables me to state quite the con-
trary. without fear of contradiction by any man who
stayed there long enough to know what lie’s ta'kin
about. The average time the burly Southerner could
stand against the fever was four weeks, while the shrivelled
Bananaman on an average withstood it perhaps 16 weeks.
About a dozen of the latter escaped the fever, but not
a single mother’s son from south of Brisbane ; many
of the latter being knocked over inside of eight days.
Same in Westralia. Also, the Queenslander takes on
hand far more hardships than Southerners. Who but
acclimatised Queenslanders open up new country ? Why,
Queensland swagmeu, on johnny-cake, have succeeded
where gorgeously turned-out expeditions from the South
have failed ! Bananamen are not afraid to return to
Papua and face the fever a second, and third time. I
have been knocking about the North and the Islands for
16 years, and my battling weight, when I get an
unlimited supply of damper and salt-horse, is Bst. 31b.
My advice to a huge, fat-headed Southern man, when
going to a place like Papua, is to take a few dozen apples
and oranges in his portmanteau. Assuming that he will
stop the average time of Southerners—" till the next boat
comes in —he may then manage to get back to the land
of the living in safety, and stand a show of bein'-- alive 20
years afterwards. "

Some of the opal-buyers in Opalville,
N.S.W., come from the Fatherland with not
enough English at command to bail up the
garden cow. Profanity, however, in the
mother tongue seems to come easily within their
grasp, writes a Bulletin man. Imagine a staid
Teuton, in all good faith, at the dinner table of
one of the hotels, requesting the handmaid to give
him another helping of that “ B y beef steak.”
CHAS, F. BARDEN, a champion English cyclist .
Photo., Barroni & Co., Melbourne.
The long-legged gentleman astride his
bicycle in the portrait is Chas. F. Barden of Put-
ney a distinguished English cyclist. He arrived
Australia with his wife and book (“ The Book
of Charles F. Barden ”) a few weeks back, and to
his eternal praise, be it said, he can cycle as
well as he can talk, and that is as well as most
Australian cyclists can eat. Consequently he has
beaten almost every cyclist he has met, including
Michael, the Welsh Wonder. Bike all the leading
professional cyclists, he knows he has the fastest
sprint m the world, and, when he hasn’t it then
he says he is out of form. When he first came out
as a. rider he was always chaperoned by his pa
and under pa s mentorship he won o 6 prizes in
succession. In matches and competitions he has
a remarkable record, and, though he is suspected
of having the least little bundle all the same his
record of victories argues for a courage equal to
his dash. On Monday week, at Adelaide, he beat
Breen in the mile, but was beaten by him in the
five and ten miles. Green should beat Barden
now, however, for the newcomer is not acclima-
tised yet. Barden rides a Swift cycle with Dun-
lop tyres.
Woman’s Lot.
There are some men—especially bachelors—who
think that women have the best of it in life.
They have an idea that very little trouble falls to
the lot of that sex, and that the claims for
women’s rights spring from a desire on the part
of the ladies to escape from the monotony of an
existence which has no cares nor sorrow. But
this is wrong. Woman’s lot is the hardest—
socially, morally, and physically. She possesses
great influence, and it is by its exercise that men
are kept in order. Her moral altitude in society
is a test to which we are all agreed to submit.
Notwithstanding all this, woman is kept rigidly
within the boundary line of conventionalism.
They suffer, these delicate creatures, as we of
stronger and coarser fibre can form little idea of.
Their delicate organisation is highly susceptible
to ailments and diseases which are almost foreign
to man. Mrs. Ada Front, 158 Donald Street,
North Brunswick, says : “For two years previous
to last Christmas I felt almost an invalid, and at
times was unable to attend to my household
duties. My former robust health had been suc-
ceeded by a listless indifference to life, and the
doctors I consulted said 1 wassutiering from liver
complaint. Last Boxing Day T went to Beau-
maris to spend the holiday, and while there quite
collapsed. I had to be almost carried home and
put to bed. Three doctors were ca’led in, who
said I was suffering from inflaination of the
bowels. After weeks of suffering the inflamation
abated, but I was so weak as to be hardly able to
turn myself in bed, and wasted to a skeleton.
In that state I continued, expecting that death
would end my sufferings, when I thought of War-
ner’s Safe Cure. Some years previously a friend
of mine had used it with the most beneficial re-
sults. My husband got me the Safe Cure, and
although I have only used five large bottles my
health is quite restored. I feel the recovery is a
wonderful one, for which I cannot be too thank-
ful.” Her case is one in thousands who have had
strength renewed and health restored by resuming
to this remedial agent.

Gentlemen, —
In 1891 I obtained a machine from your Beeston Works, and it may be of
interest to you to know that I am still riding it, although it is six years and three
months old. I must express my unqualified satisfaction with the strength and
durability of the machine. My repairs bill is under £l. My riding has not been
confined to the roads, but includes bush tracks and much-neglected surfaces in
different parts of our colony—some thousands of miles altogether.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Those members of the M. 0.0. who are notori-
ously addicted to loading up the members’ reserve with
their female relatives and friends threaten to howl against
the new rule, which practically separates the women from
the men, and gives the smokers a haven of rest. But the
bitter cry of the tame-cat brigade is unlikely to restore
the old order of things. All the women in the reserve
are “ deadheads,” and as “admirers of the game ’’they
are mostly frauds. It was quite time for them to lose the
privilege of placing their parasols between the eye of the
genuine cricket patron and the game he has come forth
to see.
* * • •
Some genius writes to a Melb. paper suggesting
that the last batsman to go in should, when his partner
gets out before he, the 1.b., has a strike, be allowed to
continue, and, “if singles were made by him, the bowlers
could take turn-about at each end. ... I think it
would be very interesting to watoh the last man scoring,
probably winning a big match; then the eleven would
have taken part in the game.”
* » * •
Out of 12 Anglo-Australian cricket-matches
played at Sydney Australia won 7 ; out of same number at
Meib. Australia won 4 and drew 2 ; and out of three
Adelaide matches Australia got one. Out of the whole 27
matches, therefore—with two draws —England takes 13
and Australia 12. Honors all but easy !
• * * *
Umpire Phillips got a special round of applause
on first coming out on the M. 0.0. ground. Frank Allan,
“the bowler of a century,” says that from one angle
Jones’s trundling is “ suspicious,” while from another it
strikes one as perfectly fair.
* * * •
“ Failure of Ranjitsinhji ” was a nice, soothing
headline for a Melb. Argus report of the England v. Vic-
toria match.
* * * *
Melbourne cricket-olub officials—the Sydneyites
are just about as bad —do not miss many opportunities of
manifesting their devout respect for “ gentlemen ”
cricketers and their contempt for professionals, and made
the most of the chances during the Englishmen’s recent
visit. For instance, the drag containing the “gentlemen”
was allowed to drive right up to the pavilion entrance,
and land its superior freight there ; whereas the profes-
sionals found an inflexible officer at the outer wall, who
sternly warned their driver off, and the pros, had to dis-
mount ignominiously in the street, and pad it down the
track to the ground. The pros, could only express their
disgust in blasphemy. That is where they have the
advantage of The Bulletin.
• * • •
George Giffen has alienated much of the sympa-
thy of Adelaide cricketers by quarrelling with a pro-
minent local player. Giffen claims to be in the right in
his dispute with Wardill and co., but he has made many
enemies by taking his grievance into local affairs.
» * • *
George Giffen— hats off! —“gave the Prince
some practice on Monday morning, and subsequently
presented him with a good bat with his name ’’— hats off
again !—“ inscribed thereon.”
* » * *
Young Tom Drew’s cricket (Drew was one of
the heroes of the Englishmen’s first match in Adelaide)
is parentally viewed with fear and trembling ; for he has
just begun his medical studies. And, anyway, in the
present state of medical study in S.A., these may take
him away from the province. Drew is a son of squatter-
cum-Broken Hillionaire Drew, one of the canniest of ’em
all.
* • * *
The North of England cricket community was
lately moving in the matter of a public testimonial for
A. N. Hornby, the tall Lancashire amateur, who has been
at the game almost as long as Grace. A mighty smiter
in his day, Hornby was second only to Grace in the affeo-
tions of the crowd.
* * * *
Froy : “ Those souvenir scoring-booklets, pre-
jented to visitors by the M. 0.0. at the England v. Victoria
match, are dangprous things in the hands of keen critios.
Kept in detail, they show, for instance, that during his
first long attack on Saturday, Richardson bowled just
four balls that had any ‘length’ at all In them. The
rest was ‘ tripe.’ ”
• • « •
If there is one thing more than another that
will endear Ranjitsinhji to the Australian public it is the
fact that he swears just like a white man.
* • • •
Surcingle: “ With brightening times, the
V.R.O. has shifted back Secretary Byron Moore’s screw
from £9OO to £lOOO. Other top-lights have been cheer-
fully dealt with in a like spirit. Meanwhile, the bulk of
the employes are neglected, though some were cut down
as far as from £2 2s. a race-day to £1 ss. under stress of
the boom downfall. A few months ago, I here referred to
the beautiful enthusiasm of a V.R.C. committee member
for a rise being given to the paid steward, with this advo-
cate’s remark that ‘ the laborer is worthy of his hire.’
Such magnanimous principles are never applied to lower
ranks. A racecourse is like a theatre —with a mass of
employes practically' invisible to the public, though, in
this case, mixed up vyith them. These are, necessarily',
honorable and, mostly, long-tried men.”
* * * *
Considering that the sporting paper by which
Southern starting-prices are largely regulated is owned
by a starting-price bookie, it is lictle wonder that winners’
prices are usually shorter in that paper than in any other
sporting medium. The exceptions are when the s.p.
man has had a “ skinner,” then the starting-price is
fabulously extravagant.

The latest sporting news from ’Murka states
that Mrs. Langtry will marry her Esterhazy before the
end of November. It is not expected that the recent
scratching of Mr. Langtry for all engagements will delay
the date of his widow’s nuptiale.

Talking of Merman’s chance for the Caesare-
witch, a London paper remarked that although the ex-
Australian horse was said to be a good thing for the
event, his owner had much to fear from Love Wisely.
The Bulletin would rather suppose that Lily owes all
her success in life to Love Wisely.

A not-too-reverent Melb. Herald reporter
headed his interview with young Steve Callinan, rider of
Gaulus in the Oup, “The Sermon on the Mount.” But
editor Reay severely frowned on the awful cross-head,
and substituted a commonplace calculated to offend
nobody.
* • * *
T.P. : “ A lot of splenetic writing about Gaulus’
Melb. Cup win is not founded on fact. As one in the
know, let me tell you that up to the last two days the
stable fancy of the pair was The Grafter.”
* * » *
Albury Border Post : “ How backers of race-
horses move in the dark was well exemplified on Saturday
by the fact that while in front of the Albury Hotel there
were backers of Gaulus for the V.R.C. Handicap at
Flemington on that day, the horse at the time was quar-
tered in the stable at the rear of the hotel.”
* • * *
Melb. Cup comment in Hobart Mercury :
“ Since Arsenal’s year (1886) the big two-mile handicap,
with a single exception—that of Auraria—has remained
on the Australian mainland, but this year it has crossed
to N.S.W. by the aid of Gaulus.

The S.A. juvenile anti-gambling bill inflicts a
maximum penalty of “£lOO or six months” on persons
betting with youths under 21, and renders the minor so
betting liable to a £2O fine. The “three-card trick ” and
the “purse trick” are prohibited by name.

“AS an illustration of the beneficial effects of ENO’S ‘FRUIT
SALT,’ I have no hesitation in giving the particulars of the case of one of
my friends. SLUGGISH ACTION of the LIVER and BILIOUS HEADACHE
affected him, so he was obliged to live upon only a few articles of diet, and to be
most sparing in their use. This did nothing in effecting a cure, although persevered
in for twenty-five years, and also consulting eminent members of the faculty. By
the use of ENO’S ‘FRUIT SALT’ henow ENJOYS VIGOROUS HEALTH; he
has NEVER had a HEADACHE or CONSTIPATION since he commenced to use
it, about six months ago, and can partake of his food to the great satisfaction of
himself and friends. You may well extend its use pro bono publico. I find it makes a
VERY REFRESHING and INVIGORATING DRINK.—I remain, yours faith-
fully, J. W. Neil.” [From the late Rev. J. W. Neil , Holy Trinity Church, North Shields.)
HEADACHE and Disordered Stomach.—' “After suffering for nearly
two and a half years from SEVERE HEADACHE and DISORDERED
STOMACH, and after trying almost everything, and spending much money, with-
out finding any benefit, I was recommended by a friend to try ENO’S ‘ FRUIT

of GOOD, and now lam RESTORED to MY USUAL HEALTH; and others I
know that have tried it have NOT ENJOYED such GOOD HEALTH for years.

Within a fortnight, M.L. ex-Treasurer
Ward was declared by the Court of Appeal duly
qualified to take his seat, was discharged from
bankruptcy, and was nominated by Seddon for
a seat on the Public Accounts Committee. Looks
as if next session w-ill see him Treasurer again.
Opposition-leader John Downer has been
so palpably wooing the S.A. Assembly Labor-
party lately that he has offended the more con-
firmed Tories who were once his most faithful
supporters. Sad to say, this loss has not been
compensated for by any real gain of Labor votes.
Inglis Clark’s acceptance of the leadership
of the Tasmanian Opposition should put some real
life into that dreary fragment. If there is one live
Democrat among the front-rank politicians of the
Isle of Snore it is Braddon’s ex-Attorney-General,
and the local dry-bones should now tie shunted
along with quite unusual celerity.
On 15th Oct. last N.S.W. aboriginals
numbered 3422 full-bloods and 3GG3 half-castes ;
full-bloods having decreased in 12 months by 81,
while half-castes increased by 182, a circumstance
which, while pointing to speedy disappearance of
the race, shows also that disappearance does not
mean death. The white race absorbs the black one.
“Nick” Fitzgerald, M.L.C., who repre-
sents the wind-power and, in the minds of many,
the wisdom of Vie. Leg. Council, is back from
his jubilee wanderings, and tells a;Melb. Herald
interviewer apropos of Federation: “I do not
think it necessary to provide against deadlocks,
as they only occur when obstinate and not com-
mon-sense men are in power.” “ What a ’ead ’e
’ave ! ” “ Nick ” must favor the abolition of the
police, since they are only needed when criminals
and not law-abiding citizens are at work.
Maoriland Opposition grows weary of
Russell, whose Roman nose, and langour, and
aristocratic “haw,” and aboriginal British Tory-
ism make the prospects of success under his leader-
ship microscopic. It is generally understood that
if Stout will sink his Cold 'tea principles and
won’t insist on establishing a compulsory regime
of root-beer, he may have the leadership for the
asking. And Stout, who only yearns for two
things in this world—office and Cold Tea—drops
his last remaining hair into his cup of misery as he
realises that he must sacrifice one of them to get
the other, or else lose them both.
One Maoriland Oppositionist indignantly
declares that Seddon, with his official salary and
his Jubilee expenses, will actually cost the country
this year “ nearly as much as the Governor.”
Well, why shouldn’t he ? If the imported figure-
head is worth, say, <£sooo a year, then even such
Premiers as Nelson and Reid are worth =£6ooo.
And men of the calibre of Turner, Seddon, and
Kingston should be cheap at £15,000. About the
most sinful grovel in this grovelsome land is the
grovel which values a mere useless Excellency at
J 35000 or <£7ooo, while Ballance received .£lOOO,
and Turner grinds out his very soul in his country’s
service at £l4OO.
The Federal Enabling
Bill just introduced into
Bananaland Assembly
bids fair to provoke a
pretty little Legislative
shindy. Inasmuch as the
Bill provides for the whole
province voting as one
electorate, it goes without
saying that the stagnant
capitalistic South will
simply annihilate all
chance of the Democratic
North and centre securing
any decent share of repre-
sentation. Consequently
North, South, and most
of the Labor-party clamor
for tripartite election so as
to give Torrea and Cen-
tralia a fair show. And
the Southern Fat Man
says he’ll see them hanged
first.
Parliament is buried in thought over
a proposed law to give the tenants of absentee
landlords powers of compulsory purchase on an
independent valuation. When are the other five
provinces going to take the first steps towards
sitting down squash on the dreadful absentee ?
It is seriously alleged that Australia is
being flooded with silver coins privately manufac-
tured in Germany. As there is only about 4d
worth of silver in the shilling, a splendid profit
can be realised by making good silver coin on a
large scale, and as there are as good workmen oufc-
the Mint as in it, there is really no certainty
that 5 or 25 or 50 or 75 per cent, of our silver coin
isn t illicit. Any country which passes off 4d
worth of metal for Is. is bound to be rushed by
illicit coinage.
A number of letters have been appearing
in the Maoriland papers recently, over the signa-
ture ‘Anna P. Stout” (the lady who lately
apologised for Chinamen). As they have con-
sisted j largely of rant about “ Purity of Govern-
ment, “Corruption of the Democracy, ” and so
on, they have much amused the public, who
remember how Stout cut up under George
l< isher, when charged by that member with having
been the most utterly corrupt administrator the
country had seen.”
A bill to make education free in N.S.W.
was thrown out in the Council by a five-to-one
majority, the Ministry rolling up its followers to
wipe out the proposal. The reason always given
in such cases is that the Treasury can’t afford to
lose the ,£50,000 a year or so which it makes out
u weekly threepences of the poorer classes —
the classes who mainly use the State schools
And the mystery of how it can afford to lose
<£sl\ooo a year by carrying newspapers free is
nev r by any chance explained.
A MAN OF THE MOMENT—RANJL.
According to a Melb. daily, Westralian
Premier Forrest has bought one or two choice
allotments in Ballarat, because he has an idea that
that city will be the Federal capital. Thoughtful
of Forrest thus to patriotically secure a site for
the Parliament - building before the property -
owners of the Garden City smell a rat and swell
the prices.
Q. Opposition leader Glassey’s electorate
of Bundaberg is very shaky politically. The
town is low financially owing to failure of sugar-
crop ; some of the Labor-leader’s firmest sup-
porters are wavering in their allegiance; and, last
but not least, a certain well-known ex-Opposition-
-Ist is quartered in Bundaberg, becoming popular,
and has aspirations for ’99.
SHOULD DRINK WITH SCIENCE.
SHE: “ My husband always gets drunk when he
comes to your place. I don't think he drinks
much. Perhaps you give him bad liquor."
PUBLLCAN: “ It’s not the quantity nor bad quality
of the liquor that makes him drunk, ma'am.
If he wants to avoid fights and keep sober, he
should drink with science."
The German press has been carefully
counting up to England for unrighteousness her
sympathy with Denmark in ’GS, with Austria in
’66, and with France in 70, and the Cologne
Gazette mutters darkly about what Germany
may have to say when the inevitable Anglo-
Russian crisis supervenes over Afghanistan. John
Bull's nearest approaches to ehivalric national
sentiment are precisely what Sauerkraut hates him
most for—as being farthest removed from the hog-
element, which the Englishman and the German
possess in common.

The general argument in N.S.W. Legis-
lative Council for rejecting the bill for free
education was that free education never ex-
isted in N.S.W., and that parents should be
compelled to pay at least a small sum in acknow-
ledgement of their responsibilities. And yet free
schools were started in Sydney in the first years
of the century. One large one was opened in
1810, and the duty of teaching the children at
State expense was clearly admitted by the Govern-
ment of the time. In 1804 a school was estab-
lished on the Hawkesbury, and as Government
funds were limited at the time, a special tax of
2a. an acre was imposed on the surrounding land-
owners to make good the teacher’s salary.
Melbourne magistrate Panton is a man of
broad, sledgehammer ideas. Giving evidence
bt‘tore Vic. Law Reform Commission, he sugges-
ted, as a valuable reform, that the right of.prison-
ers to appeal from the magistrates’ court and have
their cases reviewed by a judge should be abolished..
I lie privilege of appeal, Panton held, was “ very
undesirable.” If it was abolished, then the beak
could leave his muddy boot-marks and his hiccup,
all over the judicial records, and, if he was more
obfuscated than usual, and sentenced the plaintiff
in a small debt matter to 12 months, under the
impression that it was a manslaughter case, the
sentence would, presumably, have to stand. And
then there would be a blessed sense of rest and
security about the beak industry.

They run the party-government machine
after a fine, high-handed fashion in Maoriland
Four Liberal members, who held that Premier
Seddon should not be the paid servant of a British
mining syndicate, and voted to that effect, have
been thrown out of the Ministerial caucus and
have received information that they will hence-
forth be regarded as Oppositionists and Tories of
the worst description. The spectacle of a Premier
using his Ministerial power to compel his fol-
lowers to approve of his private jobs and syndi-
cates isn’t edifying, and Seddon’s definition of a
Liberal as a man who is in favor of Seddon
making money any way he darned well pleases
isn t edifying, eilher. Premier Dick has strained
the party-government machine nearly to breaking
point by this tune, and of late he has taken to
hobnailed methods which will yet lead to disaster.
Ihe boot-marks of their vigorous leader are grow-
altogether too conspicuous on the aggregate
hide of the Liberal party.
Writes “Vindex,” from Launceston
Dear Bulletin,— Your article, ‘Tasmania on
loast, much misrepresents Mr. Inglis Clark’s
action in resigning the office of Tasmanian
Attorney-General when it says he did so because
his professional feelings were piqued. Here are
the true facts of the matter. Pour of Mr. Clark’s
colleagues had promised, behind his back,’to exer-
cise a power under an Act of Parliament, which
involved a legal interpretation of the Act as to
the extent of the power. When the matter was
brought under the Attorney-General’s notice, he
advised them that they had not the power to do
what they had promised, and that he could not be
a party to advising the Governor to exercise thf
power; and, further, that, if they insisted on
domg it, he would feel compelled to retire bom
the Cabinet. In the face of this intimation, how-
ever, they declined to accept a resolution moved
m the House of Assembly that they should be
guided by the Attorney-General’s opinion in the
matter ; and I think you will agree with me that,
111 these circumstances, no self-respecting man
could do otherwise than instantlv resign, as Mr
Clark did.”
Does Queensland propose that Nelson—
the unspeakable fool who went through the ac-
counts of the Q.N. Bank in 1893. and couldn’t see
a single item of the =£3,000,000 of losses which were
staring him in the face, and who thereby illus-
trated that he didn’t know enough of finance to
run a retail banana-basket—shall continue to be
Treasurer of the province much longer? Or that
Barlow, who went through the accounts with him
and also saw nothing, shall remain in the Ministry?
Or that M‘llwraith, of the eight stinkful over-
drafts, and the .£200,000 of bad debts, and the
Mt. Perry copper mystery, shall remain in the
t ln [ e • r ? And hoUr do the policy-holders
of the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society
feel with Boyd D. Morehead—one of the child-like
directorate which never knew anything, and which
didn t begin to suspect anything even when the
stink of its Q.N. Bank had been audible all over
Australia for years—helping to look after their
interests as a director ? Every institution which
has one of the old Q.N. Bank crowd helping to
direct or manage or audit it should shunt him
straight away for the sake of its own good name.
1 fc .Jj own showi ng one of that crowd—the one
who is dead was a rogue, and the rest were fools

Someone writes that Miles, the Mrs.
Langtry etcher, died in the same asylum as Mr.
Langtry.
“The Suffield Case,” a 64 pp. pamphlet
containing the evidence at the police-court and at
the trial in this notorious case, with a commentary
and plan, is now published. Post-free from
Bulletin Office, 7d. in stamps. Proceeds, after
expenses paid, go to help Suffield.
Journalist John Norton is a candidate for
Sydney city aldermanship. The mind staggers
under the contemplation of what John’s unspeak-
ableness would be jn full Mayoral fig, giving some
recalcitrant city father “rats,” and laying down
the gospel according to St. John.
Miss Sutherland, of Melb. philantlii’opic
repute, recently interviewed in London concern-
ing the evil ways of that city, prescribed fiery
destruction as a desperate but necessary remedy.
This seems to have partially arrived, but unfor-
tunately Smellbourne shares in the physic, thus
marring an otherwise hairy and convincing narra-
tive.
Sydney’s shade-temperature on Saturday,
20th Nov., came within 3d eg. of the record for
that month, and was itself a record for continuity
of heat, remaining above 90dqg. for eight succes-.
sive hours, and standing, shortly after noon, at
99‘4 at the Observatory—equivalent to about 110
in the lower parts of the city. Highest country
register was 111 at Wjleanniu and Nymagee; at
Brewarrina and Leadville 110 was reached, and
Yass had 98 at 10 o’clock at night.
The Bulletin has been asked to draw
attention to the fact that a movement is on foot
to provide some .useful memorial of the late Baron
Yon Mueller. The committee which has been
formed for the purpose, and of which Frof. Bald-
win Spencer is secretary, is quite distinct from
that which has to do with the projected mortuary
memorial. However desirable that may be from a
private point of view, the Baron’s world wide
scientific reputation, Professor Spencer points out,
calls for something besides, both in the way of a
commemorative bust or medallion and of an en-
dowed prize or medal, to be appropriately allotted
to distinction in botanical or horticultural work in
the various Australian provinces. Subscriptions
may be forwarded to treasurer, College of Phar-
macy, Melb., or to the secretaries, Melbourne
University.
A Sydney Chamber of Commerce deputa-
tion interviewed Premier Reid on Monday re the
proposed stamp and probate duties, and that emi-
nent financier gave in on every point where the
deputation remonstrated at all strongly—save
one. When it asked him not to charge probate-
duty on very small estates which were the sole
support of the widow and the undeveloped orphan,
the fat man, whose mission it is to shift the bur-
dens off the poor, was adamant. The deputation
suggested that the widow who is left’ with £lOO0 —
equal to about 15s. a week income—or from that
down to .£5O, should be relieved from special
taxation, but Reid “ didn’t see it.” Then he was
asked if there wasn’t some difference between a
case where, say, £2OO is left to a bereaved wife as
the only thing between her and the Benevolent
Asylum or the streets, and the case where the
same sum is left to charity;—possibly the society
for converting the Chinese, and if it wasn’t ad vis.
able to exempt the former recipient from a heavy
special tax. And Reid briefly said that he didn’t
see it.
Th 6 Age, in a recent leader on its.critics,
speaks of a copy of a despised contemporary that
“we happened to intercept on its way to the
butterrnan.” That is not wise. It is the unfor-
tunate fate of all papers to arrive at the butter-
man, and the public only intercepts and reads
them en route.
Itumorod that a defeated candidate in re-
cent Vic. elections gave a eov. each to three sup-
posed sympathisers to do their best for him in a
certain division of tho electorate. Result, no votes
for aforesaid candidate in that division, although
his three supposed friends had votes therein.
Moral : the Ballot means free choice.
Proposed in S.A. to remove tlje break of
gauge on the Northern line from Terowie to Peters-
burg; at the latter place the line branches into
three—one going to Broken Hill, the other to Ft.
Pirie, while the third goes into the far north.
Apart from other considerations, the change would
give starved-out farmers and their teams some-
thing to do, and so is being barracked for.
In the Boer republic they lately appointed
an Inspector of Offices, and his first report was
discussed last month. As a proof of one of the
things of which the Rand new-comers complain
the document is pretty strong. The discovered
embezzlements for the year amount to .£18,590.
One Mining Commissioner’s clerk got away with
•£(1000, a Native Commissioner with .£lO,BOB, and
others had “cuts’’of from .£BOO down to a few
miserable sovereigns. And now Kruger wants to
borrow a million or two. ,
Melb. Herald publishes the 170-line
blank verse ode, written and recited by Father J.
J. Malone, at the reception of the R.C. dignitaries
present at the opening of St. Patrick’s Cathedral.
The remarkable thing about' the ode is that the
Bible verse. (First Epistle of John,- v. 4) which
heads it, is part of a chapter very Anglican and not
at all Roman, rind ending, “Little children keep
yourselves from idols.” The ode itself is absolutely
undenominational and might have been written
by Bishop Coe, or some other Anglican poet, con-
cerning St. Paul’s.
A S.A. return lately compiled shows, in a
striking way, the effect of the varying rainfall in
the North. In 1884 there was 13in. rain at Pt.
Augusta (the chief port for the North); next year
2,117,b1iS bushels of wheat were shipped thence.
Next year there were 9in., badly distributed, and
18,108 bushels were shipped. In 1888 there was
Gin., and 149,837 bushels were shipped in 1889
14in. fell, and the export was 1,858,408 bushels.
But, while 2,117,506 bushels were exported from
the port in 1885, the aggregate of the past three
years has been only 1,899,170 bushels.
The death of Chas. A. Dana, of New York
SUN, was cabled the other day. A few weeks ago,
when within two years of 80, he was well to the
front in the big journalistic fray started by the
World and the Journal over their rival con-
trivances for posting-up results of big base-ball
matches, one of the features of which was the
World’s offer of a tandem-bike and a free Euro-
pean tour to the most popular cycliste in New
York—to be chosen by coupon-voting. A great
circulation-increase resulted, but when the Jour-
nal came out with an answering offer of two
sterling silver tandems, and free European trips
to 10 wheelwomen and 10 wheelmen, it ran its cir-
culation up to 3,000,000.

G. H. Reid, Premier of N.S.W., by his
fast budget speech, showed himself to be the
champion figure-manipulator of the world ; but in
the Strand Arcade, Sydney, is to be seen a speci-
men of figure-manipulation, so to speak, that goes
one better than even the stout little man’s, for his
very own figure, eyeglass and all, worked in gold-
wire, is there presented with startling faithfulness.
A gold portrait is surely the most fitting compli-
ment that can be paid a paper financier; and the
public are invited to inspect the above and many
other beautiful specimens of Carl Stockle, the
lightning gold-wire artist’s work. He makes over
100 unique and original designs of jewellery from
gold wire while you wait, and the prices charged
are so reasonable and the goods themselves so
dainty and novel that it is not surprising to learn
that already the artist is experiencing difficulty in
supplying all his orders. For Xmas presents his
jewellery is specially suitable, and the public are
requested to place their orders at the earliest op-
portunity, otherwise execution of same cannot be
guaranteed.*

The deduction of a Vic. income-tax from the
stakes won by visiting horse-owners is easily made to look
ridiculous. For instance, why not demand income-tax
from the profits earned by a Sydney bookmaker in his
Victorian betting on each and every occasion when they
exceed t 200? If a Sydney man in Melbourne were to
arrange a sequence of ten tosses with a local gambler for
£lOOO a toss, and were to lose six times out of ten, why
shouldn’t he be taxed on each of his four wins? Presum-
ing that an owner, who doesn’t fancy nis horse, chooses
to “ hedge ” by laying against his chance to the amount
of the stake-money, is he to pay tax on the stake if his
animal should come in first? And if not. why not ?

“Maluma, in the Duke of York Stakes, lost
£3OOO of Mrs. Langtry’s capital,” writes The Bulletin’s
London correspondent; “ and the Prince of Wales also
dropped a couple of hundred on the Australian. The
stable was very confident, going on the results of the
trials with Angelos, but the mare did not look too well at
the post, and after the Newmarket Handicap distance had
been covered she fell back and finished fifth, the Ameri-
can Diakka winning as he liked. It was a great dis-
appointment to the antipodean contingent who consoled
themselves by saying Angelos was a ‘ thief,’ and wouldn’t
' really try in the trials—hence the over-estimate of
Maluma’s fitness,” ....
“Gallantly indeed did* Merman avenge his
stable companion’s defeat,” continues the writer, “ and
Mrs. Langtry’s Oesarevvitch will live until an Australian
horse wins the Epsom Derby. . ‘.Mr. Jersey ’ was in
great luck altogether. Invited into the Jockey Club en-
closure—whence she had been excluded for over a twelve-
month —at the express wish of her old boy, Albert
Edward, she, on her birthday, saw Merman win her over
£lB,OOO by one of the finest fought-out finishes ever seen
at Newmarket. Forty ydrds from home The Rush lead
by half a length, but the plucky Merman gained inch by
inch, and, thanks to Sharpies, put his neck in the judge’s
eye. The excitement was enormous.”
• * * *
The details of Merman’s’victory in the Cesare-
witch show that the Australian horse was probably the
second best of the competitors, although he carried only
7st, 51b. In a field of 22 he received weight from five of
them, the top-weight being The Rush (Bst. 31b.), who was
beaten by a neck. Two others carried more than Bst.
and were placed third and fourth—nearly five lengths
behind Merman.

One pertinent question arises naturally from the
Parthenopseus case, and a dozen other Flemington “ rop-
ing” cases that have passed unnoticed. What,, in the
sacred name of Salary, is the use of the V.R.C. stipendiary
steward ? If he couldn’t see Parthenopaius running cronk,
what can he see ?
* * • •
A few months back, The Bulletin remembers,
it uttered a snort of contempt at the glorification of book-
makers Sam Allen and Tom Arnfield by the Melb. daily
press, in connection with a “ banquet” given to those two
“ leading members of the ring.”
» » * •
The V.R.C. ought to have donned the black cap
when sentencing bookmakers Allen and Arnfield, over the
Parthenopißiis affair. For two men whose world is sport,
and sport alone, to be utterly shut out of the world’s
racing centres, and denied the places where sportsmen
foregather, is death indeed.
» * « •
What has Parthenopseus done that he should be
wiped out for life? He’s a clever, well-meaning, and
thoroughly honest horse, and his parents were perfectly
respectable, law-abiding’ people.

The vaporings of Ikey Mo and Co., just prior
and subsequent to a big race, are excruciatingly amusing.
From their utterances an outsider would be led to believe
that their sole dealings are in ponies and hundreds, with
occasional monkeys “just to oblige owners,” whereas
their real counters are the “ casers,” sovs. and half-sovs.
of the ever-to-be-bled public. When approached by an
owner or his accredited agent they shut up like a tele-
scope. In very truth, they bet in marbles now when com-
pared with the times of Joe Thompson.

lie Ga ulus’s performance in the Hotham Handi-
cap on the Saturday before the Cup. The tale goes that
the horse, running very wide, got so close to the abat-
toirs that one slaughterman called out to another, “ ’E’s
looking for a bit o’ meat, Bill; throw ’im a pluck.” •

It is related that on the day, a year or two ago
when a certain big Melb. scandal was revealed, one of the
principals strolled into David Svme’s sanctum and
abruptly announced, “ Look ’ere, Syire, we wancher not
to publish that there business of me and -Ikey Solomon.”
The autocrat looked up with an amazed stare. “Hoot
non," he cried, “ A shall publeesh just what a like.” The
other scratched his head. “Me an Ikev alius bought the
Age,” he said, reproachfully, “I think it’s on’y a fair
thing to keep it out.” King David grew - indignant.
“ Leave ma office,” he cried. The other started to obey.
He had his hand on- the door when a thought struck him.'
“ Look ’ere, S.vme, old man,” he said, with a smile of
certainty, “If you keep your mouth shut I’ll stand ver a
fiver, and I’ll guarantee Ikey ain’t particular to a bob or
two himself.”

Had the Britishers seen Mr. .Tack Hagerty
despatch his 2ft horses per starting-machine in the Welter
Handicap at Moorefield on Saturday, they would have
seen that the machine is bound to' coine in England. In
France it is declared a success, and several owners are
having machines erected on their private training-tracks.
* * * »
“Carandtni’s starting-machine, exhibited in one
race at Newmarket,” writes Tub Bulletin’s London cor-
respondent, “ was not a success, the horses objecting to
standing behind ; while the riders, opposed to innovation,
sneered outright, and helped the failure. English flying-
starts accustom the horses to be on a restless move, and
handicap the gate here, so Corlett, of the Pink ’Un, sug-
gests it should be introduced to 2-year-clds only at’first,
2 and 3-year-olds the second year, and so on. The Sports-
man people, who are financially backing it, plump thick,
strong and often for the new starter, and there is no
country where it is wanted more than here, where the
starting is cruel.”
* • * •
The hill at Moorefield may have something to
do with “ reversals of form ” and consequent downing of
backers, but certain it is that the course is proverbially a
good one for the layers of odds. On Saturday last, of the
six winners two started at 10 to 1, and one each at 8 and
7 to 1 respectively.
* • • •
To the outsider, it seems an extraordinary state
of afFairs that a double-shop kteper should be heavily
fined whilst another man, at the same game, on the same
day, in the same street, almost immediately opposite, was
openly doing a business which needed three clerks to keep
pace with. What say the police?
* * * *
A certain influential club down South shows a
profit for the year just closed of over ±2OOO, no small part
of which has been earned by the poker-machine and the
racing totalisator, both run bv the “club.”
» * * *
To-day (Sat.),'some good racing should be seen
at Randwick. Aboriginal seems to have a fair chance of
winning the hurdles, whilst Princess Arena and Tripos
look well in the Course Handicap. Liska will likely be
the best youngster in the Nursery Stakes, and, unlucky
as he 'has been of late, the Captain may win the Club
Handicap. The High-weight Handicap should fall to
Sayles in the probable absence of the imported Voyou,
who will win a race ere long.
* * * *
Lillie Bridge (Sydney) racing-law is a bit mixed.
The rider of a pony the other night declared 31bs. over,
but the clerk of the scales called ‘2lbs. The pony won, but
was disqualified when weighed in for the alleged declaring
of only 21bs. over, and the race was awarded to the second
pony. The disqualified pony when weighing out for a
race later in the night, was ordered to carry a 71bs,
penalty, as winner of the race for which he was disquali-
fied.

Barbara, one of the jumpers taken to England
by Mr. H. Bartlett, brought 100 guineas, Everton falling
to a hid of 80 guineas. The Childe Harold stallion. Era,
did not sell, and it is to he hoped he comes back here.
Era is a model as regards conformation and action, and
would worthily take the place of his deceased sire.

Geo. Giffen was in wonderful fettle with Ithe
ball against Vic. in Adelaide. “ Qiflf.” vowed at the start
of the season that he would abandon bowling this year,
but he will change his mind now. He is in better form
with the ball than with the bat.
• * • *
Jack Lyons is a cool, sober batsman now. In
his first innings against Victoria he played just the same
game as he did against England. There was none of the
slogging of old, but sound, correct, powerful hatting.
“Carbine," his friends'think, cannot now be omitted
from the first test game.
» * * »
Victoria is very weak in bowling this year, and
is not too strong in batting. Ciller, one of the new men,
promises well all-round, and M'Michael is a batsman
.with a future, but the Sheffield Shield this year should be
battled for by N.S.W. and S.A. An illustration of weak-
ness is the fact that there is not a single Victorian
with a certainty of being in the first test! Trott arid
Truinble way get in, but they are neither of them cer-
tainties. Trott, by the way, is stated to be very unwell
and not fit to be playing cricket.
* • * *
The newspapers throughout Australia seemed
determined from the first to evolve a Ranjitsinhji boom,
and every mention of the dusky slogger was assiduously
scissored for republication. One Sydney daily printed a
lengthy article, with “ splash ” headings, and the sub-
editor was astonished to find that the interesting informa-
tion had previously been clipped by a firm of biscuit-
makers, and embodied in an advt. which had been running
for close on three weeks in the same up-to-date journal.
» * » •
N. : “Why is Mr. Ranjitsinhji styled Prince
in the Australian cricket scores, whereas, in England, he
is in variably ‘K. S. Ranjitsinhji?’ Reminds me again of
Higjnbotham’s remark about how much more Conserva-
tive Australia is than England. I heard Coppin say the
same after his last trip to London.”
* « * •
Veteran Charley Lawrence (now coaching the
colts for the Melbourne Cricket-club), writing to a friend
in Sydney, remarks that Ranjitsinhji is just such another
bat as Syd. Gregory, and there is little between them,
barring Gregory being the faster scorer. Lawrence
thinks the Britishers a strong team, but he reckons they
will be ou(plassed by all Australia.

Bails : “ Why not 1 Stoddartists ’ instead of

WALK UP!
“ What a queer little walk Ranjitsinhji has got! ”
Remarked a sweet maid to her mate ;
Be replied : “ Well, as Ranji’s the draw of the lot,
’Tis largely a matter of gate."
* * * *
Managements of Vic. cricket continues funny.
Beecham, of Fitzroy, with every claim to be chosen to go
to Adelaide, was omitted until Trumble found he couldn’t
leave Melbourne. In Adelaide Beecham was left out of
the playing eleven, and Laver, but recently arrived from
the American “ baseball ” funeral, stepped in. Laver is
one of the “ selectors ” of the team.
* » * *
Johns got little or no praise for his admirable
wicket-keeping in Melb. against the Englishmen. His
chief; fault is a mannerism of throwing up both hands
after the batsman has played the ball, as if he had taken
a catch. It looks like a reminder to the crowd that Johns
is alive and well.
For Paddington against South Sydney, on
Saturday, Trumper played a perfect innings for 125. In
the match v. England, fortune (in the shape of a lightning
catch by Ranji), in the first innings, was dead against the
lad; should he continue to pile up his centuries in clulj
cricket, that catch should not stand against him re his
chance of inclusion versus Pye’s, which appears to he the
bone of contention in certain quarters. Last Saturday,
Trumper scored 125 as against Pye’s 9, and it will be
interesting to keep up a weekly comparison between the
pair for future reference by the selection committee.
* * * *
The English cricketers are both amused and in-
dignant with the Sydney crowd. Amused at the Ranji-
worship, and indignant at the brutal chivvying of Garrett
« * • *
From “ Noss ” Iredale’s cricket notes in the
Australian Star : —“There were many in the pavilion on
Saturday who were ready to cry ‘ Peccavi’ at the chances
of N.S. Wales holding her own with the English team.”
It would evidently be better for “ Noss ” to stick to the
vernacular in his “ cries.” Also, is it not in questionable
taste for a player to write criticisms on his comrades or
opponents while the contest is proceeding ?
* * * V
The Englishmen’s batting averages for the three
“colony” matches leave Ranji. at the head of the list
with 97. Storer is a close second with an average of 94 ;
Mason, 02 : Maclaren, 50. The others have done nothing
in particular, but Hearne happens to cut a respectable
-figure on paper with a total of 39 runs for four innings,
and only one “ out.”

Megson had an easy task in the Vic. Brassard
contests. The one mile he won by 3J lengths, and if he
didn’t beat Forbes by more than half-a-length in the ten
miles it was solely because he was satisfied that that was
enough. The moral of the match is that Forbes is not in
the same class as the Sydneyite, and that probably Walne
is better than either.
A huge farce was perpetrated by having the men
paced by single machines, which amounts to about the
same thing as having a racehorse paced by a cow. Meg-
son and Forbes contesting the Vic. championship are
naturally assumed to be the two best men in Victoria,
and yet the league officials turn out or permit a lot of third-
classers on the tracks ostensibly to help the cracks along.
Multicycle pacing would have given Forbes a better show,
for, as a stayer, he might bother Megson in a fast-ridden
race ; but with such snails’ speed as that set by singles a
sprinter like Megson will score every time.
Bilmartin made his first reappearance since the
Adelaide episode, jumping about the stand with a snap-
shot camera. The gentle Bill has been letting his
moustache grow—evidently as a gauge of defiance to any-
body who might hint he was clean-shaved through his
gaoi experiences. Parsons was also about again after his
operation, and threatens to race within six months. He
busied himself exchanging ’Murkanisms with Nankivell,
the artist, who w-as himself a racing pedaller in Melb. six
years ago.

Re Bill Martin having a “plugger’s brain,” a
large and foolhardy friend of The Bulletin authorises it
to say there is nothing the matter with Bill’s alleged
brain. Nine out of Bill’s 10 component parts are bull-dog
courage and ferocity. His only idea of an argument is to
turn on the other party and rend him. He is the ideal
Roman gladiator, and if he knew as much about boxing
as he does of cycling, he would be the dandiest fighter i hat
ever chewed tobacco, and would beat any middle-weight
on earth.

The paced hero Lesna, who did Australia so
picturesquely with a retinue of retainers, has gone down
three times before Michael in America. The men met in
three matches over 20, 25 and 33 miles, and Michael wal-
loped out the Frenchman by four yards, a lap and four
laps respectively. Michael was, however, afterwards
beaten by the Yankee Starbuck, whom Lesna defeated
soon after he arrived in ’Murka.

Peter Jackson is now in America ready to take
on any of the big ones, Corbett for choice. W. W.
Naughton, than whom there is no better judge, says
the blackfellow has not altered a bit in appearance, and
ridicules the reports of Jackson as a listless and worn-out
man. He still affects the tall, silk hat, gold-headed um-
brella, and fashionable overcoat.

“ Joe Goddard, seen in Fleet-street, looked very
fit and strong," writes The Bulletin’s London corres-
pondent. “He has just left for the States to meet
Sharkey or Fitzsimmons, and be looms big and ferocious
Suffield and “Justice.”
In N.S.W. Assembly, the other day, when the
estimates of the Justice Dept, were under con-
sideration, some members pled the cause of
Thomas Suffield—the alleged brutal criminal to
whom the Justice Dept, offers liberty before the
expiration of his sentence, the astonishing alleged
criminal who refuses the offer because he desires
liberty less than the enquiry which he believes
will restore his good name.
The narrow, callous Minister Gould rebuffed
protest with his insolently and ignorantly reiter-
ated assurance that there is no ground for an en-
quiry into Suffield’s case.
The net brutality of this rejoinder may be in-
ferred from the following facts :
1. Suffield was accused of outraging a woman,
and was condemned to ten years’ penal servitude,
on the evidence oj that woman alone.
2. Although he was a stranger to that woman,
had only once seen her, had never spoken to her.
3. Although he was an educated man of high
character, and had ample opportunities for grati-
fying his passions, if he so desired, without using
brutal violence to a stranger.
4. Although two witnesses swear that at the
tume of the alleged assault he.was in his bedroom,
which he could not leave without their knowledge
and did not leave.
5. Although his clothes and person bore no
marks whatsoever, though the woman—strong and
healthy—said she struggled with him for a long
time on wet ground, and was herself bruised
frightfully, while her clothes were torn in a
manner which only great force could have accom-
plished.
6. Although, if Suffield. committed the assault,
ho was such a fool as to let his victim pass by a
lonely bush road nearly a mile long, up to a spot
at most 78 yards from her employer’s windows
and there assault her about ten o’clock in the
evening, just when she was expected home, before
the household had gone to bed—and continue his
outrage though her screams were immediately
answered from the house !
7. Although the woman on whose sole evidence
he was convicted at first attributed her injuries to
the attack of a bull—which afterwards similarly
attacked, and similarly injured , another woman
and was shot for it.
9.- Although' the woman declared she was un-
conscious when according to the evidence of her
employer, his son, and a doctor, she was not un-
conscious.
9. Although the woman declared at the pre-
liminary hearing’ that she left for home at a cer-
tain time, apd declared at the trial that she did
not leave until 20 minutes after that time—appa-
rently in order to make her evidence tally with
that of other witnesses at the preliminary hearing.
10; Although there was no absolutely-conelusive
medical evidence of assault by a man ; and the
doctor who examined the woman an hour after the
alleged assault, and again the following morning
refused to swear she had been assaulted by a man!
11. Although the woman—though she was, ac-
cording to the evidence of two witnesses, quite
conscious when found, 10 minutes after the alleged
assault—said not a word to indicate that Suffield
had assaulted her; nor did she accuse Suffield to
the doctor who examined her and found her per-
fectly conscious one hour after the alleged assault.
It was only on the following morning that she said
a man had assaulted her; and it was some
hours later that she said Suffield had assaulted her.
e the woman’s identification of
Suffield was positively made after seeing him once
only, several weeks before, standing in a street—
and that when her companion swears his back was
turned to them ! She could identify Suffield at 10
o clock on a cloudy moonlight night, and swears
to him; yet when she passed him in broad day-
light, the same morning, she could not swear to
him—she could only say it was a man “ very like
him ” ! J
13. Although a score of other circumstances go
to show that the girl made a mistake, or was
suffering from sexual hallucination caused by the
shook of the bull’s attack.
_ 14. Although section 383 of the N.S. Wales
Criminal Law Amendment Act enacts that when
any doubt or question arises ” as to a prisoner’s
guilt an enquiry may be held before any justice of
the peace—and in Suffield’s case there are a hun-
dred doubts and questions.
The Bulletin still hopes that Parliament will
force, the Justice Department to hold an open
enquiry into Suffield’s case, allowing him to be
represented by counseiand to call witnesses whose
evidence has apparentbeen suppressed. If jus-
tice according to law is still denied to Suffield,
The Bulletin will appeal to the Judges of the
Supreme Court of N.S. Wales, any one of whom
has the legal right to order such an enquiry.

All Heaven laughed the other day to hear
a Victorian M.L.C. telling Randolph Bedford that
he oughtn’t to wear a wide straw hat over a frock-
coat.
It is good to see right rewarded. A recent
example is the way small wool-growers are appre-
ciating the equitable innovation lately introduced
by Pitt, Sob & Badgery, Ltd., of charging the Same
rate of commission on little clips as on large con-
signments. A rigid observance-of the truism that
woolbrokers should have no interests calculated to
conflict with their duty to obtain the highest
prices for their principals, is, no doubt, also a
factor of, popularity.* !
The hot weather is now upon us, turning
adipose tissue into perspiration, and pats of butter
into,oil. By way of preventing this latter annual
calamity, Brandt Bros., of 236 Pitt-street, Sydney,
place their improved butter-cooler on the market.
The cooler, which has proved a perfect success, is
worked by the capillary action of water, no
chemicals or ice being required, and the hotter the
weather the cooler the butter grows, owing to in-
creased evaporation of water.*
The progressiyenpss of Messrs. Harrington
and Company, Ltd., of 66 Ring-street, Sydney,
is such that the firm has added another warehouse
to its premises; and this new establishment in
Kent-street, Sydfiey, is used entirely for bulk
stock and manufacturing. This firm is offering
two splendid new cameras, the “Victor” pocket
camera, and the “ Duplex ” hand camera. The
“\ i .tor uses plates, thus doing away with two-
thirds the cost and all the risks of films; its
mechanism is as perfect as a large Camera ; it is
praised everywhere, and its cost is only one guinea.
The “ Duplex ” is a twin lens hand camera ; has
the distinct Advantage of having a full-size finder,
is eminently suited for cyclists, and is most simple
in movement. It costs only 255.*

will come more and more hike and roller developments,

of the mere man-upon-feet shall be rendered a burden to
him. In a Sydney suburb the other day Tub Bulletin
saw a larrikin standing on roller-skates at one end of a
long stretch of asphalt, and holding a string attached to
his dog’s collar, and when the larrikin cried “Go 1” the
dog went for all he was worth, tooling his principal along
behind him at a pace that is dead sure forthwith to pro-
duce other tyke-dragged boys-on-wheels, and much
scorching, and then tracks, and prizes, and carnivals, and
a new terror to existence generally. The boy-and-dog

Ten years hence. S.M. Herald news-summary
paragraph : “ The Japanese team of cricketers arrived by

tough-looking lot. They comprise a nephew to the

are said to be faster than English Richardson or Jones
ever were, and several of their hats are as good as Ranji.
They should give a better account of themselves than the
English team that visited us last year.”

“Ascending a long and rough hill, the other
day,” writes a bikist to The Bulletin, “ I overtook two

The first one I passed made no sign ; the second, about 20
yards ahead, evidently mistook me for her companion,
and, as she heard my wheel behind her, spake without
raising her head from the handle-bars : “ Say, Maggie 1
Damn the roads!’ ‘By all means 1’ said I, cordially.
Don’t think 1 ever before saw a woman get off her machine
in such a hurry.”

At Samoa, where cricket-matches are played

gained.

A good old Wellington (M.L.) sport, who is

his trusted Cashier was about £lOOO short in his cash.

the old man Had never shot a bird sitting, and his sports-
manlike: irtstirtcts Revolted. So he told the defaulter that
he could have lour days’ start, and at the end of that
time the force would be put on his track, and if he didn’t
keep far enough ahead he would have to stand the con -
sequences. The cashier promptly ran for his life, and
ho\y the police are after him, and the genial old man is
tnakirig a book among his friends on the race. His sym-
pathies apparently lie with the cashier, possibly because
fie feels that he gave him rather a short handicap ; any-
how he is backing his vanished employe.

—“ I have found betting-men such a bad lot that I want

The Bulletin allows “Pressman” (Melb.)
to have his say
Dear Bulletin,-— Your par. of Nov. 6 re the .defunct
Vic. Reporters’ Association and Randolph Bedford is
really all wrong. The beginning of the Association was a
combination of men on the Age staff who had a grievance.
Then it grew by the addition of men on the staffs of other
daily papers. It wg,s formed solely for the purpose of
fighting grievances froin which only regular members of
a daily paper staff could suffer—it was an association of
working reporters. Such'a thing as a protestive and pro-
tective combination of reporters had never beem dreamt
of by the proprietors, and once the Association was
established with carefully-considered and comprehensive
rules the evils at which it aimed vanished. Then, having
done its work, it became merely ornamental, and pro-
prietors, editors and “leaders” of staffs were admitted,
and were only too glad to join. The Association then
■was more social than fighting, and—the more the merrier.
Ultimately it died, but there was no revival of the
grievances which it Was formed to fight. Randolph Bed-
ford, at the time, was not a member of the reporting
staff of any of the papers, and, therefore, was not eligible
for admission to the Association. If it had been.a jour-
nalists’ club, Bedford would certainly have been most
welcome, and I am only one of many who would have
been very glad to nominate him, but the reasons
for the Association’s existence did not affect him in the
slightest—luckily for him. I could nCvet understand
why a brilliant, original writer like Bedford should feel
so keenly (even to this day) his non-admission to an asso-
ciation of mere reporters of other people’s words. The
association was not “ a conspiracy to deny membership
to the brighter class of press-workers.” After one meet-
ing the brighter class would have said : “We have
nothing at stake here. These fellows are fighting a battle
peculiarly their own.” You call the members “dullards.”
All the more reason why Bedford should have kept aloof
of his own will. There were other men in exactly the
same position as he, but they never worried, simply
because they stopped to find out and understand. You
say that the association is “ long since dead and forgotten
as far as Melbourne journalism is concerned.” This again
is wrong. One of the most useful things the Association
did was to institute badges for reporters, for use as pass-
ports with the police, firemen, &c., in big crowds when
titpe was the essence of the contract. So, in a very em-
phatic way, to anyone who is a daily paper reporter, the
Association, though dead, is by no means forgotten. De
mortuis nil nisi verum. —many of the most practical sug-
gestions emanated from the late Harry C. Rhys-Jcnes, then
'on the Herald, and one or two men on the Age. In no way
was Bedford affected, save in his own imagination. And
' I’rii very certain that the alleged buttonholing and quota-
tion of his non-admission to the Association “ by an Aon
reporter ” was not a part of “ the Agf. plan to damage his
candidature for Melb. eastern suburbs.” Doesn’tit sound
a bit too “cheap,” on the face of itV—Yours, etc., Press-
man, P.S., 16th NoV., —Have just heard frotn R.B. him-
' self 6f' settlement to-day of his libel-action against the
. Age. Perhaps he forgets now about that non-admission
td a Reporters’ Association.

A heathen Chinee lately “got the bulge
on” the N.S.W. Treasury authorities. He was
fined at Hay £lOO or three months for sly-grog
selling, but as one of the adjudicating J’sP. had
an interest in a whisky-mill, the verdict was upset
on appeal to the Supreme Court.
Announced that “a movement is on foot
for settling Polish and Russian Jews on the aban-
doned farm lands of Essex.” Essex is a fertile
district, and it reaches within five miles of London,
the biggest city and the biggest market on earth,
rv othing could much better illustrate the ruin of
British agriculture under Freetrade. By-and-bye,
Britain will be able to supply Bogan scrub-cutting
jobs for the unemployed right at the back-door of
London.
At a meeting of the China Inland Mission, held at a
Baptist church in Melb. the other night, Mr. Philip
Kitchen, lion, treasurer of the noble mission, was re-
ported as saying : “ He would draw the attention of the
meeting to the fact that only one out of every 1500 per-
sons on the earth was a Christian, and consequently the
were going to eternal perdition. There were
"u " ens dymg every minute, and during the time
they had spent in that church that evening some seven
01 eight thousand had gone to a hopeless grave and
entered a Christless eternity.”
T °ba cc °-exp e rt A. M. Howell says the
Waverley district of Sydney possesses exactly the
soil for growing that highest-grade gold-leaf
tobacco which, by the fancy prices it commands,
compensates for the comparatively small yield re-
turned by this “ white, light, poor soil with 80 to
9o per cent, of sand.” Mr. Howell sees no reason
wny JN.b.W., in addition to keeping her own
pij>e alight, shouldn’t build up in time a big ex-
port tobacco trade.
An angel, from the azure skies,
Was contemplating life below,
“How sad,” he said, and wiped his eyes,
Whence many tears began to flow,
11 That only one-fifteenth per cent.
Of all the mortals I behold
Can hope to fly the Firmament
Surmounted by a crown of gold—
As statisticians tell.
“/cannot, sav whose head shall wear
A halo round about its crown :
I cannot guess which creatures there
Will soon be garbed in snow-white gown j.
I merely know I’m plunged in grief
To think that one, by grace divine,
Gets saved because of his Belief,
Whilst fourteen ’undred and ninety-nine
Are bound to go to H—l.
“I touch my harp and daily sing
The dirge of them whose souls are lost
For want of Faith whereby to cling
To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
They live and die without desire
To walk the narrow, winding way,
Their fate is everlasting fire.
Ping, Ping, the awful Judgment Hay—
O, Lord ! Thy will be done.
“ I tune iny harp to mournful strains
Whene’er reflection’s cud I chew ;
Hereafter seems so full of pains
For all except the Chosen Few,
Though each contestant in the race
Would like to catch the eye of God,
The price against him for a place
Is fourteen ’undred ninety odd,
Yes, ninety odd to one.”

DYSPEPSIA and its treatment is receiving
much more than a share of attention from the
medical journalistic world. The British Phar-
maceutical Journal has published an article of
about four pages by the well-known Professor
I'inkier, going into a series of experiments com-
paring papain as a digestive ferment with pepsin,
and, in nearly every case, the papain results are
the most favorable. After showing the results of
the experiments, he winds up the article as fol-
lows :
Pepsine acts in the stomach, and not in the
intestines, as in the iatter the reaction is neutral or
alkaline. Papain has little effect in the stomach,
as the reaction there is acid ; when, however, the
stomach is neutral or alkaline, papain will pep-
tonise, while pepsine will be useless. The degree
of acid reaction in the stomach varies greatly,
especially in the case of a stomach out of order, in
which case the reaction can be so highly acid or
alkaline that pepsine would be of no value at all.
For the treatment of stomach catarrh we will,
however, find that as a general rule the contents
of the viscus have been rendered artificially neu-
tral or alkaline by the administration of remedies,
so that in these cases pepsine will have absolutely
no effect. Papain, on the contrary, will act ener-
getically. Regarding the time available for the
digestive ferment to act in the body, in the case of
pepsine this is necessarily very short, as the action
ceases when the food enters alkaline reaction of
the intestines. In the case of papain, which can
act well in alkaline reaction, the time is prac-
tically unlimited, as it continues acting on the
food during the whole time it remains in the body.
For all these reasons the conditions for the effect
in the human body are far more in favor of papain
than pepsine, and especially as under existing
oircumstances (high degree of concentration) pap-
pain has been shown to act more energetically.
It is only too clear that the preference should be
given to papain as a digestive ferment for the
treatment of dyspepsia. Besides for dyspepsia,
the papain is of great importance in the treatment
of diphtheria. Its effective power consists in the
circumstance that no free acid need be present in
the application, and, further, that the moisture of
the diphtheric membranes is quite sufficient to
allow the ferment to dissolve the solidified sub-
stance of the membranes. No other ferment has
so far been able to obtain these results. It is on
this account that many competent experimentalists
and specialists have lately made observation as to
these points. From all these circumstances there
is no doubt that in papain we have a ferment
which has a great future before it, and it is for
this reason that I have made a special study of the
manner of preparing the papain. I have had the
satisfaction of obtaining the most favorable results
from its use in the treatment of disease.”
The Extra Pharmacopaeia, page 305, says
that Papian is the dried juice of the Paw Paw
(Carica Papaya,) and goes on to show its medical
value. The Medical Annual of the current
edition also publishes a long article on the fruit
ferment Papain from the Paw Paw, and quotes
from an American work the Polyclinic, of June,
1896, showing the very beneficial results obtained
from the use of Papain in cases of indigestion,
proving that its digestive power, while in the sys-
tem, is greater than any other ferment known.
In a supplement to Chambers Encyclopaedia
Papain is described as follows:—“Papain is a
Nitrogenous Body, isolated from the juice of the
tropical Paw Paw. . , . The juice has for a
long time been used in the West Indies for
making meat tender; but it has only recently
been shown that Papain possesses, like Pepsin
and Trypsin, the power of digesting meat fibre,
and this digestion will go on in an alkaline, a neu-
tral, or an acid solution. Hence, it belongs to the
group of Digestive Ferments, and, like them, is
employed in casefof Dyspepsia, or employed for
the predigestion of food.”
The proprietor of the Cairns Preserving Works,
noting the great digestive ability of the Paw Paw
Fruit, which grows prolifically in North Queens-
land, has manufactured a delicious table sauce
from it. All the principal grocers sell it. This
digestive tropical novelty is receiving much atten-
tion.*

In Nelson (M.L.), the other day, a man
took out his money in the street— probably to
gloat over it. Two hours afterwards he missed a
fiver. After vainly searching his pockets he re-
turned to the spot where he had taken out Ins
lucre, and there, serenely lying on the footpath
(main street, too), was his fiver —neatly, folded as
he had last seen it. “ Sleepy Hollow,” indeed.
Noteworthy that out of 8476 Berlin
divorces—’Bs to ’94—more than half were of child-
less couples, while 1766 pairs had but one child,
and 1042 onlv two. In two cases, however, there
were 10 children ; in two, 11; and in one, 12 the
mother in this case being only 36 ! In two in-
stances the parties had been married over 25 years,
and in 500 over 20; though 316 couples had been
under one year married, and 497 under two years.
Rhea or ramie, whose cultivation is shortly
to be boomed in Australia, failed dismally in New
Australia because, though the plant flourished ex-
ceedingly there, no practicable means had then
been devised of separating the silky fibre from the
gummy sap. “ Besides,” a returned New Austra-
lian says, “don’t go into hysterics when the high
price obtainable for the fibre is mentioned —so
many pounds a ton. A room-full of raniie would
weigh more than the same bulk of thistle-down,
but not much.”
They have a queer way of doing business
on the W. A. railwavs. Recently, while travelling
from Albany to the goldfields, a Bulletin cor-
respondent saw lady passengers who had boarded
the train at two different stations get out at their
respective destinations and pay before leaving the
platform. “ During the journey alluded to,” con-
tinues the writer, “I heard a tall yarn told by an
ancient sandgroper. He said that wlrle livin'! at
Geraldton he had found a dead horse with a stout
chain firmly embedded in its neck. Suspended
from the chain was a very heavy bell, and the
weight of the bell and chain combined had caused
the chain to chafe its way through the flesh, which
had grown over it. The chain had continued to
grow downwards until it became embedded in the
spinal column, when death had evidently resulted.
He has, he said, placed it upon record by having
it photographed.” Wanted, that photo.
“The Snag,” on a subject of bush interest:
Dear Bulletin, — Be tools of the Australian bushman,
H.F. must have struck a very queer box of axes. The
bushman of my acquaintance only cuts half the nob off
the handle —not because it is too long, but simply to
enable him to drive the handle in without splitting it.
Ring-barkers invariably cut from 3 to 9 inches off the
handle to give speed in chopping; and, as to temper, it
would be hard to beat “Collins” or “ the Chopper’s
Pride.” Seventy-five per cent, of these axes will stand
in any of our timbers, if not ground too thin. Also, in all
my years of bush-work X never knew a bushman who
broke out every other tooth in a cross-cut saw, although
for soft timber, like cedar, fine beach, or brushwoods, we
prefer an open-space cross-cut without drag-teeth. For
hardwoods of all kinds, Diston’s peg, or full-lightning, is
second to none, and, I think, cannot be improved upon.
His pit-saws are most used, especially in cedar, being of
better temper and balance than the other makers. As to
the bushman’s wedges, they are locally made to order.
The most inferior-article we have in the bush is the im-
; or ted bushman! —The Snag.

BRONCHITIS & ASTHMA
Rapidly Cured by
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at ita
v.i :.derful influence. Sufferers from any form of bron-
tis, distressing cough, difficulty of breathing, hoarse-
ness, pain or soreness in the chest, experience delightful
and immediate relief, and to those who are subject to
colds on the chest it is invaluable, as it effects a com-
plete cure. It is most comforting in allaying tickling and
irritation in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become chronic.
No house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning,
a dose is generally sufficient, and a complete cure is
certain.
“ Mr. W. G. HE ARNE.—Dear Sir,-I had a bad attack
of Bronchitis for six months, with dreadful hacking cough
day and night and great quantity of phlegm. Night
sweats came on and pains in my chest, and I got so weak
that I could not leave my bed. At this stage I was pro-
nounced to be in consumption. I had a lot of medicines
of different kinds, but nothing did me any good until,
reading in the Age of your ‘ Bronchitis Cure,’ I got a
bottle, and after taking two doses I was much improved.
After taking two bottles the cough and night sweats left
me, my appetite returned, and I was able to get up ; and
am now in good health, for which I am truly grateful,
and shall recommend your Medicine to all my friends. —
Yours truly, E. SMITH, Halpin Park, Nhill, Victoria.”
“After suffering from Asthma until I was 17 years old,
and having been under a great many different treatments
without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne’s Medicine
for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this medicine,
I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then, which
was in the beginning of 1883, 14 years ago, I have not
had the slightest return of it. The Medicine quite
cured me, and I have much pleasure in recommending it.
—ALEX. J. ANDERSON, Geelong, Victoria.”

Indigestion.
WHAT A SYDNEY LADY THINKS OF IT.
Of all the ills that flesh is heir to perhaps the
commonest and, at the same time, the most try-
ing, is indigestion. It is impossible to over-esti-
mate the terrible results that may follow in its
wake. Mrs. Maud Hughes, of 414 Victoria-
street, Darlinghurst, Sydney, had it in a severe
way, and very kindly placed the following details
in the possession of a reporter :
“ It is now about two years since the indigestion
first attacked me. It commenced with gnawing
pains, and every time I breathed it hurt me. My
appetite left me, and the very sight of food made
'Y
M
\j>y
V
me feel sick, and very often at night I could not
sleep; when I did, my rest was disturbed by
frightful dreams. Although I had the very best
medical advice in New South Wales and other
colonies my condition did not improve, but on the
contrary got worse. I suffered from terrible head-
aches and a sort of mist seemed to hang over my
eyes. Knowing how ill I was, for I had by this
time lost a great deal of flesh, a lady who called
to see me one day said, ‘ I have made a great dis-
cover, which lam going to tell you all about. It
is the great virtue of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills,
and they have done me all the good in the world.’
My friend spoke in such glowing terms of the
great benefit they had been to her, and having
also seen a number of advertisements of this
medicine, proclaiming it a positive cure for
dyspepsia and indigestion, I determined to
give it a trial, and bought three boxes to
start with, and commenced taking the contents,
following the directions that were wrapped round
each box. I felt better from the first. Before
commencing them I had been brought down so
low with suffering that my medical adviser had
ordered me a change of air, and strongly recom-
mended a sea .voyage. This advice I followed,
and in a few days left for Europe, taking a supply
of the pills with me. By continuing with them
my health and appetite improved wonderfully,
and I am sure the Messageries Maritimes Co.
didn’t make much out of me, for I never missed a
meal whilst at sea, ‘falling in ’ to breakfast, tiffin,
and dinner most religiously. Instead of a fasting
lady I think I may justly lay claim to the title of
a feasting lady. I decided to get a fresh supply
of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills at Paris; I experi-
enced no difficulty in obtaining them there. After
spending a short time in England I returned
home to Australia, and I am sure I feel a good ten
years younger. My spirits have revived, my
complexion has improved, and I take a fresh
interest in life. I attribute all these good results
to the use of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale
People, as before taking them I felt invariably
listless and drowsy. I am quite convinced it is
this medicine that has cured me ; in fact, I have
taken no other. Yes, you are quite at liberty to

An Enervated System Revived.
(From the Carlton Gazette, Melbourne.)
Mr. A. Sayers, of 57 Adam-street, South Yarra,
is perhaps one of the best-known mining men of
Victoria. It would be a difficult thing, in fact,
UJ
to find any
mining centre
where this gen-
tleman has not,
with more or
less success, as-
sisted in the
development of
Victoria’s gol-
den treasures.
At Ballarat,
Sandhurst,
Malden, &c.,
his name and
person are fa-
miliar. While
awaiting fresh opportunities, and at the same
time recuperating— there is nothing so wearing on
the system as a life on ’Change—he has been so
successful in the latter respect that one of our
representatives, visiting him on business, could
not help remarking it.
“I feel better now than I have for many years
past. Tlie last two months my whole system has
been re tuned—wound up to concert-pitch, as it
were,” was the reply.
“You suffered severely? ”
“Yes, but not so much physically as from an
entire absence of tone in the system. I could
transact my business fairly well; but the con-
tinual excitement of over three decades of mining
life—prospecting, promoting, speculating, and
Exchange life —had hold on me of late years. The
system had run down ; that was about it.”
“ Why not have visited a medical man and
secured a tonic ? ”
“ I did ; several doctors agreeing that it was a
tonic I required. But they failed to supply that
much-needed mental and also physical bracer.
They supplied plenty of them, both in quantity
and variety, but with no appreciable benefit—the
least business effort bringing about a recurrence
of the all-overish feeling.”
“ What do you attribute the change to ? ”
“ Well, a barrister friend of mine, a great suf-
ferer from paralysis, mentioned to me the immense
benefit he had experienced from a course of Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People, and, some
two months since, I invested in a couple of boxes.”
“ How did they pan out ? ”
“ Much better than some of my mining specs.—
like pure gold. A few boxes strung me up pro-
perly ; my appetite improved, and work (before a
heavy task) became a pleasure.
“ No. A few boxes of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
did for me what pounds’ sterling worth of doctors’
Btuff failed to accomplish.”
“ You are perfectly satisfied of the merits of Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills for purifying the blood and as
a nerve tonic ?
“ Certainly. For re-toning a system run-down
by overwork or mental anxiety, they cannot be
beaten, and I lose no opportunity of so informing
my friends."

LIFE?
DR. WILLIAMS’ PINK PILLS FOR PALE
PEOPLE WILL CURE YOU.
(From the Tarrangower Times, Victoria.)
“My daughter had been strong and healthy
until about two years ago,” said Mrs. Bowe, of
North Maldron, Victoria, to our reporter, when
she grew very pale and thin. She became weak
and low-spirited, lost her appetite, her sleep was
troubled and restless, and the least exertion fatigued
her—in fact, she had to take her sister’s arm for
sa
support when out
walking. She was
of a wonderfully
active and cheer-
ful disposition be-
fore this change
took place, and the
alteration, there-
fore, caused us
great concern, and
medical aid was
sought. But no
good resulted.
Several medicines
were tried, but she
became weaker
and more listless
every day. The
doctor said she was suffering from anaemia, or
poorness of blood. We then became seriously
alarmed, and consulted different medical men, who
prescribed, and told Miss May to take as much
exercise as possible. She, being fond of flowers,
naturally turned her attention to the garden, but
had to abandon the work, as the least exertion ex-
hausted her. Often, when I thought she was out
taking exercise in the fresh air, I have found her
in the drawing-room in a somnolent state. Then,
when disturbed, she would steal quietly to her
room, and remain there for hours at a time. At
this stage we became extremely anxious concerning
her health, and again sought medical advice, as
we thought she was going into a decline. It was
of no use, though ; nothing did her any good.
She was then so thin and weak that the slightest
exertion tired her. She also suffered from severe
oramps in the legs.
“ Friends then recommended patent medicines,
and two or three kinds were tried, unsuccessfully.
“At last I decided to take her away to the
country for a change, but just as I was about to
do so I saw in the Tarrangower Times an adver-
tisement about Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale
People, and noticing that people with symptoms
similar to those of my daughter had been cured, I
determined to give them a trial.
“ After usiirg half a box a great improvement
was noticeable, and after using three boxes she
regained her appetite, was able to sleep with
comfort, and was so strong and well that we con-
sidered that there was no necessity for her con-
tinuing to take Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. So she
discontinued using them. I honestly believe my
daughter’s recovery was due to the great remedy.
She is now as well as ever she was in her life.
She has a fine color, i 3 able to eat and sleep well,
and can take any amount of outdoor exercise
without feeling fatigued. I feel very grateful to
Dr. Williams for my daughter’s recovery, and
would like to have the case made known, as it
may induce others who suffer as my daughter did
to try this remedy to their benefit, and thus
perhaps bring sunshine and happiness to their
homes.”
Great satisfaction has been expressed by Miss
Bowe’s large circle of friends that she is again
enjoying good health, and able to take her accus-
tomed place at local social gatherings.
D? WILLIAMS’
ILLS
FOR
ALE
EOPLE
Rheumatism and Neuralgia,
(From the National Advocate.)
For many years Mr. J. H. Potter, of Wiagdon,
a small rural settlement on the outskirts of
Bathurst, has been subject to severe attacks of
rheumatism and neuralgia. Believing the history
of his maladies and recovery would interest our
readers, we despatched to his residence a reporter,
who successfully solicited the following details
“Well,” began Mr. Potter, “I must tell you
that in my younger days I did a good deal of
camping out; I continually got wet through, and
sometimes put on damp clothes. As a conse-
quence, I contracted rheumatism, and later on
neuralgia in the head. 1 became a perfect martyr
to these trying ills, which kept me company for
many years ; they affected my appetite, rest, and
temper to such a degree that I hardly ate or slept
at all, and was irritable with everthing and every-
body. The pains about my eyes were very agon-
ising. I was in Bathurst the time the last show
was held, and had a fearful time of it. I tried all
sorts of remedies but got no relief.”
“ Did you consult a doctor ? ”
“ Yes, I consulted one in Melbourne, one of the
most prominent there, but he could do nothing for
me; he said I had all sorts of complaints, and
wanted to perform a similar operation on me to
that he had lately achieved in another case, viz.,
that of piercing the bone of the affected part, but
this I declined, and left him, deciding rather to
endure my pains than to submit to it.”
‘ ‘ What did you do then ? ”
“Just about this time I read in the Sunday
Times some accounts of cures brought about by
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People, and
then and there made up my mind to see what they
would do for me. I bought a box ; when I had
finished that I seemed a different man. The third
box worked wonders, and I felt grand. I reckon
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People are a
splendid remedy. I can now eat heartily and
sleep well.”
“You hold a high opinion of their value, then ?”
Of course I do. They do what is claimed for
them, and I can strongly recommend them to all
sufferers. My wife knows what they did for me,
and consequently thinks as much of them as I do.
If I went to a friend’s house for tea, Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills for Pale People went with me, and
directly the meal was over I took the prescribed
number. My friends used to laugh at me, but I
didn t mind. I told them the laugh would be on
my side soon, and so it is ; they know it too.”
Mr. Potter does not present the appearance of a
man who has endured so much suffering. He is
the picture of health, and has the best of spirits ;
his business (bee-farming), which was necessarily
sadly neglected during his illness, is also thriving.
And these desirable changes he attributes to the
marvellous efficacy of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for
Palo People.
A Locomotor Ataxia Cure in
Sydney.
DR. WILLIAMS’ PINK PILLS SCORE AI
OTHER GREAT VICTORY AFTER
DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS
WERE UTTERLY UN-
SUCCESSFUL.
About six years ago, when residing in Hobart,
Tasmania,” said Mrs. Nellie Denver, of Countess
Cottage, Double Bay, Sydney, to a reporter, “I
had the misfortune to meet with a serious accident,
which _ happened in the simplest manner possible,
as I will endeavor to relate. On leaving my house
by the back gate, the bolt slipped whilst I had
hold of it, which caused me to fall very heavilv,
which I subsequently discovered had seriously in-
jured my spine, although, strange to say, I felt no
ill-effect for about two years later. I then com-
menced to suffer from great weakness and dizzi-
ness, and an intolerable feeling of exhaustion ; in
fact, I felt so nervous and uneasy that I feared to
cross the street, alarmed that I might meet with
some accident from a passing vehicle. Not at first
recognising the really serious condition to which I
was reduced, I did not seek medical attendance,
but when I at last became aware of my serious
condition, I was persuaded by my friends to go to
the Sydney Hospital, where I remained two months
without receiving any permanent benefit. On
leaving the hospital I again rather neglected my
state of health, and on applying for re-admission
was informed that my oase was perfectly
hopeless. Being, unfortunately, not over-blessed
with this world’s goods, I obtained admission to
the Newington Asylum, where I remained seven
months ; yet still I got no better, being unable to
swallow any nourishing food. I then took two
courses of electric baths, for which I paid six
guineas, and after them, with the exception of
some slight alleviation of my suffering, I cannot
say that they did me much good ; in fact. I could
not even walk, so I returned home, feeling very
despondent, and imagining that there was no cure
in store for me. One day, on reading the daily
paper, I noticed an account of a marvellous re-
covery effected by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for
Pale People, and considering that this case (the
one of Boilermaker Jarvis, suffering from loco-
motor ataxia) closely resembled mine, I deter*
<3
mined to make a trial of them, and sent a boy
from the house to buy some for me. I experienced
relief after the first box, and have steadily im-
proved ever since; my appetite returned, and I
ceased to suffer from that terrible feeling of ner-
vousness. lam now in my seventh box, and can
confidently assert that I am most decidedly im-
proved in health. My friends also notice a
marked improvement in my condition, and this I
entirely attribute to the health-giving properties
of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills : in fact, it must be
solely due to them, for I have tried no other
remedy. The proprietors of Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills are at perfect liberty to make whatever use
they may think fit of this statement, for I feel
deeply grateful for the benefit I have derived from
them.”
Such is the remarkable history, and confirms
what is said in all the chief newspapers of this
country of the astonishing cures wrought by Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People. They cure
locomotor ataxia, partial paralysis and spinal
disease, also the many disorders which arise from
an impoverished state of the blood, such as
anaemia, pale and sallow complexion, general mus-
cular weakness, indigestion, loss of appetite, in-
fluenza’s evil after effects, shortness of breath,
pains in the back, nervous headaches, etc.

Pale and Sallow Girls.
What can be more distressing; than to see a girl
drooping and fading in the springtime of youth?
Instead of bright eyes, glowing, rosy cheeks, and
an elastic step, there are dull eyes, pale, sallow, or
greenish complexion, and a languidness of step
that bespeak disease and an early death if proper
treatment is not promptly resorted to and per-
sisted in until the impoverished blood is enriched
and the functions of life become regular.
Upon parents and guardians rest a great re-
sponsibility at the time their daughters are bud-
ding into womanhood. If your daughter is pale,
complains of weaknesses “tired out” upon the
slightest exertion ; if she is troubled with head-
ache or backache, pain in the side ; if her temper
is fitful and her appetite poor, she is in a condition
of extreme peril, a fit subject for the development
of the most dreaded of all diseases—Consumption.
If you notice any of the above symptoms, lose no
time in procuring Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. They
will assist the patient to develop properly and
regularly; they will enrich the blood and restore
health’s roses to the cheeks; bright eyes and
lightness of step will surely follow their use, and
all danger of consumption and premature death
will be averted. Wise and prudent mothers will
insist upon their daughters taking Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills upon the approach of the period of
womanhood, and thus avoid all chances of disease
or early decay.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People have
cured paralysis, locomotor ataxy, rheumatism and
sciatica : also all diseases arising from impoverish-
ment of the blood, scrofula, rickets, chronic ery-
sipelas, consumption of the bowels and lungs,
anaemia, pale and sallow complexion, general
muscular weakness, loss of appetite, palpitations,
pains in the back, nervous headache, early decay,
all forms of female weakness, and hysteria. These
pills are a tonic, not a purgative. They are
genuine only with the full name, Dr. Williams
Pink Pills for Pale People, and are sold only in
boxes, encircling which is a blue warning label,
the outside wrapper being of white paper bearing
the firm’s trrde mark printed in red ink. Ihey

We wake and sigh, we sleep and, 10,
The gentlest eyes look lone and weep I
Ah, why do lost loves tease us so
When we lie down to sleep?
Awake, my wife, how shall I dare
The silence ! Closer —heart to heart I
Your breath is wandering in my hair,
But yet how far apart!
Long have we lived like those that loved
With wedded hand and mingled mouth,
The truth suppressed —but strangely moved,
My heart is dust and drouth.
I d eamt she came—a maiden pale,
A maiden pale, dead long ago ;
And she spake words of no avail,
An I she gave looks of woe.
Dowr streamed the brown hair round her head ;
She whispered, and with sudden start
I rose and kissed her roses red,
And pressed her to my heart.
The roses paled ; like shadowed light
She vanished, and I could not speak j
Upon the blind the moon was white,
My lips were on your cheek !
The woman said, “ We sleep and, 10,
The gentlest eyes look love and weep !
Ah, why do lost loves tease us so,
When we lie down to sleep ?
“ I dreamt he came, the king of men,
Who drifted deathward long years gone,
I le love-light in his eyes as when
With fire of Life they shone :
‘ A rose-bud like a lonely pearl
From his pale fingers trembled low,
And to his lips he pressed a curl—
A curl of long ago.
“ And * This,’ he said, ‘ was love of mine ’ —
The rosebud waved in mist away ;
And ‘ This,’ he said, 1 was gift of thine *•—
The curl of gold grew grey.
“ Then down he bent in true love-wise—
I could but sigh, I could not spo>ak ;
We kissed—the moon shone in these eyes,
Your lips were on my cheek.”
They slept no more that dreamful night;
A cloud made dark the moonlit room ;
Lost Youth was nigh them with its white
Ghost lovers from the tomb.

The affairs of a large southern mercantile firm
have become so desperate that, in default of the dis-
counting facilities formerly accorded to their bills on
their dummy branches, they now “ put in ” dummy bills

interested in the firm’s welfare.

On change. “ Anything to avoid, here ? ” said
an intending broker to an old Exchange hand. “Yes;
any man with a pale face and a weak voice. Every time
I’ve fallen in here, it has been to a man with a pipeclay
face and squeaky talk. Lombroso says pallor is the color
of genius. I say it is also the color of hypocrisy.”
A witness before the Westralia Royal Mining

A very “fly” man stepped into a very well-
known Melb. shop, and asked to look at a good and very
cheap opera-glass in the window. It was handed out,
and, knowing all about the change-ringing business, he
kept tight hold of it. The Oriental in charge tried all
other dodges, but the man was “ fly,” paid his money, and
was about to go. “ Buy a case for it,” said one of the
Eastern gentlemen. “ No.” “ Veil, veil, ve’ll gif you
one, den." The case was produced, and the glass put in.
When the “ fly” man got home one lens was missing, and
is still. The quickness of the hand had deceived the eye,
and thus the “trader,” done out of the good glass, had
his revenge.

T.D.: “On two or three recent occasions, I
have received printed lists (issued by rival firms) of sur-
names purporting to be those of persons to whom money
is owing by wind or windfall. ‘ Christian ’ names are not
given, and as a guinea has to be forwarded before the
slightest information is vouchsafed, the firms must make
fine hauls out of numerous Smiths, Browns and Joneses
whose imaginations have been stimulated to visions of
untold wealth. The scheme is probably worked on
registry-office lines, with a hot scale of charges for more
definite information, solicitor’s fees, and so forth—until
the time comes for telling the anxious client that he
hasn’t a leg to stand on.”

Exposure of the alleged drawback swindle on
Melb. has, strange to say, already curtailed interpro-
vincial exports from Victoria enormously. The Customs
have an eye on other large exporters of goods subject to
drawback, and names are freely mentioned in Southern
commercial circles. Considering the magnificent possi-
bilities offered to dishonest traders by the laxity of draw-
back regulations, it is almost incredible that so few prose-
cutions have been instituted.

At least two prominent Australian pencillers

H.M.: “What price the public patience in
re the languid bank ledger-keeper ? For years have
studied anxious customers standing in dumb humiliation
beside an impenetrable barricade six feet high, until the
hawty figure-official, who ignores all manner of appeal, is
pleased to peer over and inquiah their wishes. This state
of ‘ splendid ’ isolation inflicted upon bank-clients while
awaiting their cheques or pass-book, is calculated to
damage that instinct of lawn«?der alleged to be the pro-
perty of every right-thinking citizen.”
On account of the high-rate the insurance co.’s
charge in some of the mining centres in W.A., one store-
keeper has erected poppet-legs over his store, and has a
large tank of water on top, with hose attached long
enough to reach all over his premises in case of fire, and
large enough fp drown the establishment in one act.
Then he does his own insurance.

Mismanagement, writes a Bulletin correspon-
dent, has a great deal to do with the disasters which have
overtaken many W.A. mines I know a mine not 30 miles
from Ooolgardie where it costs £l7 per week for wages to
supervise one shaft in which there are but six men. The
contract price is £7 15s. per foot, and one drill will put a
hole in. There is a man paid £5 per week to superintend
sinking operations, a clerk at £5 per week, and the
manager (not a miner) £7 per week. I could give you a
long list of such things—not perhaps quite so glaring.

Westralian mining managers are asking the
Govt. “ to either fight the patent rights of the cyanide
syndicate or buy out their claim. If royalties are paid it
will mean that only good-grade ore will be treated, leaving
entirely untouched lodes worth 7dwt. to i-oz.” So well-
trained in boom-time lying are these hummers that they
can’t shake it off even when the truth is the right thing
commercially. How can a 5 per cent, royalty, such as is
proposed for the use of cyanide, and that only on the gold
won by its distinct application, make all this difference?
It is reasoning of this kind which has made the public so
tired of mining news from W.A. as published by the
principal Eastern dailies.

A very big mining lawsuit is reported to be
under weigh at Charters Towers. The question at issue
is whether or not the agent for a wealthy mine and mill-

of years, to various cvanide parties, exceeded his powers.

The New Woman has been whooping over
the refusal of some of her to leave a Melbourne
court during the taking of some extremely under-

similar request—“Oh, it doesn’t matter —all the

“The metaphysical Christian,” writes a
Bulletin correspondent, “is the funniest of all
modern faddists. An acquaintance prominent
among the faith-healers recently squashed a finger
in a door-jamb. Five minutes afterwards I found
him prancing up and down his verandah, holding
the bruised and bleeding digit aloft and proclaim-
ing loudly, * There is no pain ! I say there is no
pain ! ’ But simulated exultation could not over-
come the agony that contorted his face. I notice,
also, that no Christian Metaphysist fails to ‘ lie
up ’ when assailed by anything worse than in-
digestion or a sore throat. Surely, faith should
pull the brethren through without the ulterior
assistance of a holiday.”

He had gone back to the bedroom, after break-

was a man’s red silk sock ! He never wore other
than cotton.

Furiously he paced the room for a space ; then,
with a violent effort, calmed himself sufficiently

Dr. Buschau brings out in clearness and detail the

mental derangement is from four to six times as common

good. According to Tobler, almost all Jewish women are
hysterical. Diabetes is very common. As Ziemmsen has
observed, there is a neurotic strain through the whole
race of Israel. The extraordinary proclivity is not due to
heightened mental exertion, since many Jews, as in Hun-
gary and Poland, lead a very quiet life, and yet there the
tendency to neurosis is still marked.

It was a real scorcher. A soft, sweltering
summer’s day. The air quivered ; the heat drove
the fowls under the dray and sent the old dog to
sleep upon the floor inside the house. The iron
on the ski 11 ion creaked and sweated—so did Dad
and Dave down the paddock, grubbing—grubbing
in 130 deg. of sunshine. They were clearing a
piece of new land—a heavily-timbered box-tree
flat. They had been at it a fortnight, and if any
music was in the ring of the axe or the rattle of
the pick when commencing, there was none now.
Dad wished to be cheerful and comp'acent. He
said (putting the pick down and dragging his
flannel off to wring it) : “It’s a good thing to
sweat well.” Dave didn’t say anything. I don’t
know what he thought, but he looked up at Dad-
just looked up at him—while the perspiration
fi led his eyes and ran down over his nose like
r tin off a shingle ; then he hitched up his pants
and “ wired in ” again. Dave was a philosopher.
He worked away until the axe flew off the handle
with a ring and a bound and might have been lost
in the long grass for ever only Dad stopped it
with his shin ; but I fancy he didn’t mean to stop
it when I think how he jumped—it was the only
piece of excitement there had been the whole of
that relentlessly solemn fortnight. Dad got vexed
—he was in a hurry with the grubbing—and said
lie never could get anything done without some-
thing going wrong. Dave wasn’t sorry the axe
came off—he knew it meant half-an-hour in the
shade fixing it on again. “ Anyway,” Dad went
on, “ we’ll go to dinner now.”
On the way to the house he several times looked
at the sky—that cloudless, burning sky—and said,
to no one in particular, “I wish to God it would
rain ! ” It sounded like an aggravated prayer.
Dave didn’t speak, and I don’t think Dad expected
he would.
* » » *
Joe was the last to sit down to dinner, and
he came in steaming hot. He had chased out of
sight a cow that had poked into the cultivation.
Joe mostly went about with green bushes in his
hat, to keep his head cool, and a few gum-leaves
were now sticking in his moist and matted hair.
“ I put her out, Dad ! ” he said, casting an eager
glare at everything on the table. “She tried
to jump and got stuck on the fence, and broke it
all down. On’y I couldn’t get anything, I’d er
broke ’er head—there wasn’t a thing, on’y
dead cornstalks and cowdung about.” Then
he lunged his fork desperately at a blowfly
that persistently hovered about his plate, and
commenced, Joe had a healthy appetite. He
had charged his mouth with a load of cold meat,
when his jaws ceased work, and, opening his
mouth as though he were sleepy, he leaned for-
ward and calmly returned it all to the plate. Dad
got suspicious, and asked Joe what was up; but
Joe only wiped his mouth, looked sideways at his
plate, and pushed it away. All of us stopped
eating then, and stared at each other. Mother
said, “ Well, I—l wrapped a cloth round it so
nothing could get in, and put it in the safe—l
don’t know where on earth to put the meat, I’m
sure; if I put it in a bag and hang it up that thief
of a dog gets it.”
“ Yes,” Dad observed, “ I believe he’d stick his
nose into hell itself, Ellen, if he thought there was
a bone there—and there ought to be lots by this
time.” Then lie turned over the remains of that
cold meat, and, considering we had all witnessed
the last kick of the slaughtered beast, it was sur-
prising what animation this part of him yet
retained. In vain did Dad explore for a really
dead piece—there was life in all of it. Joe wasn’t
satisfied. He said he knew where there were a
lot of eggs, and disappeared down the yard. Eggs
were not plentiful on our selection, because we
too often had to eat the hens when there was no
meat—three or four were as many as we ever saw
at one time. So on this day, when Joe ap-
peared with a hatful, there was excitement. He
felt himself a hero. We thought him a little
saviour.
“My!’’said mother, “where did you get all
those '! ”
“Get ’em ! I’ve had these planted for three
munce—they’re a nest I found long ago; I thought
I wouldn’t say anythink till we really wanted
’em.” Just then one of the eggs fell out of the
hat and went off “ pop ” on the floor. Dave
nearly upset the table, he rose so suddenly ; and
covering his nose with one hand he made for the
door; then he scowled back over his shoulder at
Joe. He utterly scorned his brother Joe. All of
us deserted the table except Dad —he stuck to his
place manfully ; it took a lot to shift him. Joe
must have had a fine nerve. “That’s on’y one
bad ’n’,” he said, taking the rest to the fireplace
where the kettle stood. Then Dad, who had re-
mained calm and majestic, broke out. “Damn
y’ boy ! ” he yelled, “ take tli’ awful things out-
s;de—you tinker ! ” Joe took them out and tried
them all, but I forget if he found a good one.
* * * *
Dad peered into the almost-empty water-
cask and again muttered a short prayer for rain.
He decided to do no more grubbing that day, but
to run wire around the new land instead. The
posts had been in the ground some time, and were
bored. Dave and Sarah bored them. Sarah was
as good as any man—so Dad reckoned. She could
turn her hand to anything, from sewing a shirt
to sinking a post-hole. She could give Dave
inches in arm-measurements, and talk about a leg !
She had a leg—a beauty ! It was as thick at the
ankle as Dad s was at the thigh, nearly,
, Anyone who would know what real amusement
is should try wiring posts. What was to have
been the top wire (the No. 8 stuff) Dad com-
menced to put in the bottom holes, and we ran
it through some 12 or 15 posts before he saw the
mistake—then we dragged it out slowly and
savagely ; Dad swearing adequately all the time.
At last everything went splendidly. We
dragged the wire through panel after panel, and at
intervals Dad would examine the blistering sky for
signs of rain. Once when he looked up a red
bullock was reaching for his waistcoat which
hung on a branch of a low tree. Dad sang out.
The bullock poked out his tongue and reached
higher. Then Dad told Joe to run. Joe ran—so
did the bullock, but faster, and with the waist-
coat that once was a part of mother’s shawl half-
way down his throat. Had the shreds and ribbons
that dangled to it been a little longer, he might
have trodden on them and pulled it back, but he
didn’t. Joe deemed it his duty to follow that red
bullock till it dropped the waistcoat, so he ham-
mered along full split behind. Dad and Dave
stood watching until pursued and pursuer vanished
down the gully ; then Dad said something about
<Joe_ being a fool, and they pulled at the wire
again They were nearing a corner post, and
Dad was hauling it through the last panel when
there came the devil’s own noise of galloping
hoofs. Fifty or more cattle came careering along
straight for the fence, bellowing and kicking np
their heels in the air, as cattle do sometimes after
a shower of rain. Joe was behind them—con-
siderably still at full speed and yelping like a
dog. Joe loved excitement.
For weeks those cattle had been accustomed to
go m and out between the posts ; and they didn’t
seem to have any thoughts of wire as they bounded
along. Dave stood with gaping mouth. Dad
groaned, and the wire’s-end he was holding in his
hand flew up with a whiz and took a scrap of his
ear away. The cattle got mixed up in the wires.
Some toppled over; some were caught by the legs;
some by the horns. They dragged the wire 20 and
30 yards away, twisted it round logs, and left a lot
of the posts pointing to sunset. Oh, Dad’s
language then ! He swung his arms about and
foamed at the mouth, Dave edged away from
him. Joe came up waving triumphantly a chewed
piece of the waistcoat. “ D-d-did it g-give them
a buster, Dad ! he said, the sweat running over
his face as though a spring had broken out on top
of his head. Dad jumped a log arid tried to un-
buckle his strap and reach for Joe at the same
time, but Joe fled.
That threw a painful pall over everything. Dad
declared he was sick and tired of the'whole thing
and wouldn’t do another hand’s-turn. Dave
meditated and walked along the fence, plucking
off scraps of skin and hair that here and there
clung to the bent and battered wire.
* * * *
We just had finished supper when old Bob
Wren, a bachelor who farmed about two miles
from us, arrived. He used to come over every
mail-night and bring his newspaper with him.
Bob couldn’t read a word, so he always got Dad to
spell over the paper to him. We didn’t take a
newspaper.
Bob said there were clouds gathering behind
Flat Top when he came in, and Dad went out and
looked, and for the fiftieth time that day prayed
in his own way for rain. Then he took the paper
and we gathered at the table to listen. “Hello,”
he commenced, “ this is M'Doolan’s paper you’ve
got, Bob.”
Bob rather thought it wasn’t.
“Yes, yes, man, it is” Dad put in; “see, it’s
addressed to him.”
Bob leaned over and looked at the address, and
said : “ No, no, that’s mine ; it always comes like
that.” Dad laughed. We all laughed. He
opened it, anyway. He hadn’t read for five
minutes when the light flickered nearly out.
Sarah reckoned the oil was about done, and poured
water in the lamp to raise the kerosene to the
wick, but that didn’t last long, and, as there was
no fat in the house, Dad squatted on the floor and
read by the fire-light.
He plodded through the paper tediously from
end to end, reading the murders and robberies a
second time. Fhe clouds that old Bob said were
gathering when he came in were now developing
to a storm, for the wind began to rise, and the
giant iron-bark tree that grew close behind the
house swayed and creaked weirdly, and threw out
those strange sobs and moans that on wild nights
impart terror to the hearts of bush children. A
glimmer of lightning appeared through the cracks
in the slabs. Old Bob said he would go before it
came on, and started into the inky darkness.
It scorning!” Dad said, as he shut the door
and put the peg in after seeing old Bob out. And
it came—in no time. A fierce wind struck the
house. Then a vivid flash of lightning lit up
every crack and hole, and a clap of thunder fol-
lowed that nearly shook the place down.
Dad ran to the back door and put his shoulder
against it; Dave stood to the front one, and Sarah
sat on the sofa with her arms around mother, telling
her not to be afraid. The wind blew furiously—its
one aim seemed the shifting of the house. Gust
after gust struck the walls and loft them quiver-
ing. Ihe children screamed. Dad called and
shouted, but no one could catch a word he said.
1 hen there was one tremendous crack—we under-
stood it the iron-bark tree had gone over. At
last, the shingled roof commenced to give. Several
times the ends rose (and our hair too) and fell
back into place again with a. clap. Then it went
clean away in one piece, with a rip like splitting a
ribbon, and there we stood, affrighted and shelter-
less, inside the walls. Then the wind went down
and it rained—rained on us all night.
* * * *
Next morning .Toe had been to the new
fence for the axe for Dad, and was off again as
fast as he could run, when he remembered some-
thing and called out, “Dad, old B-B-Bob’s just
over there, lyin’ down in the gully.”
Dad started up. “It’s ’ini all right —T
w-w-wouldn ter noticed, on’y Prince s-s-smelt
him.
“ Quick and show me where ! ” Dad said
Joe showed him.
“My God ! ” and Dad stood and stared. Old
Bob it was—dead. Dead as Moses
“Poor old Bob!” Dad said. “Poor-old-
tellow ! Joe asked what could have killed him »
Poor—old— Bob ! ”
Dave brought the dray, and we took him to the
house—or what remained of it.
Dad couldn't make out the cause of death—per-
haps it was lightning. He held a post-mortem
and after thinking hard for a long while, told
mother he was certain, anyway, that old Boh
would never get up again.
It was a change to have a dead man about the
place, and we were very pleased to be first, to tell
anyone who didn’t know the news about old Bob
We planted him on his own selection beneath a
gum-tree, where for years and years a family of
jackasses nightly roosted, Dad remarking: “As
there might be a chance of his bearin’, it’ll be
company for the poor old cove.”

SALT RHEUM CURED,

“For three years my daughter Edith suffered terribly with Salt-Rheum,
,yhich affected chiefly her hands, and for nearly six months at a time she
ivas constantly compelled to wear gloves. Her hands were covered with
blisters, full of a watery substance; the skin would often peel off, and the
itching and burning were intense. I paid doctors’ bills without number
and bought medicines of all kind; but all failed to give relief until I tried
AYER’S SARSAPARILLA. After using this medicine a short time an
improvement was manifest, and my daughter took in all ten bottles,—
continuing it even after all signs of her affliction had disappeared. The
Sarsaparilla purified her blood, radically curing the disease, and we are
most thankful for this great blessing.”
Be sure that you get the genuine
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
The wonderful success of this great blood purifier has led to numerous
imitations. The name— Ayer’s Sarsaparilla— is prominent on the wrapper
and is blown in the glass of each bottle. Refuse all substitutes.
