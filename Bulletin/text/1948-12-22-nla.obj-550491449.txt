BERKHAMSTEAD’S WALLS ONCE SHELTERED MANY A ROYAL HEAD
•"pHE ancient market town of Berkhamstead, in Hertfordshire, 28 miles from
London, is of Saxon origin, and its growth was due to a fortified palace
which was established here by the Kings of Mercia.
William the Conqueror (1066-1087) stayed here after the Battle of
Hastings.
Berkhamstead Castle was of such importance that it invariably accom-
panied every grant of an earldom. It was given by Henry II to Archbishop
Thomas a Becket. During the reign of King John (1199-1216) it was a royal
gift to his wife, Queen Isabella. In 1216 it was besieged by Louis, the
Dauphin of France, who had come over to assist the discontented barons.
The besieged held out until they were sent orders by the King to surrender.
The Castle was later given to the second Queen of Edward I; it next belonged
to Richard, Earl of Cornwall, who died here. Later still it was granted by
King Edward II to his favourite, Piers Gaveston. Edward 111 (1327-1377)
advanced his eldest son, Edward the Black Prince, to the title and dignity
of Duke of Cornwall and gave him the Castle and Manor of Berkhamstead
“to hold to him and the heirs of him and the eldest sons of the Kings of
England.” At this time an illustrious prisoner, John, King of France, was
held captive by the Black Prince in the Castle. The property has since
descended from the Crown to the successive Princes of Wales as heirs to the
throne and Dukes of Cornwall, under whom it has for the last three centuries
been leased to different persons.
In the 16th century Berkhamstead Castle declined in importance and
fell into decay. It is now reduced to a few massive fragments of wall which
testify to the ancient strength and importance of the fortress. The walls,
constructed of flint cemented together, are almost circular and enclose an
area of eleven acres. It was defended on the north-east by double, and on
the other side by triple, moats. The entrance to the castle was guarded by
drawbridges over the moats which, even today, are wide and deep.
William Cowper, the famous poet, who lived during the years 1731-1800,
was born in the old rectory of Berkhamstead, and is commemorated by a
memorial window in the church.

JOHN WEBB.
John Webb, who retired this year from
the editorship of The Bulletin, after 15
years in the chair, was the paper’s fifth
editor. Archibald, Traill, Edmond and
S, H. Prior v(ere his forerunners, and he
was succeeded by 39-year-old David
Adams, who joined the “Wild Cat” staff
as a youth in 1927.
Webb was born in the Buffalo River
(Vic.) district in 1882. Educated at
various bush schools, he fled from the
classroom when 13, and “became an in-
efficient (and doubtless exasperating)
office boy.” At nights he “dipped desul-
torily into Cassell’s Popular Educator,
and absorbed poetry, novels and whatnot
at the Melbourne Public Library.”
Four years later he drifted to the West
and became assistant proof-reader and
cub-reporter on the Kalgoorlie “Miner.”
In a breezy note to A. G. Stephens he
confessed that “the art of journalism as
I conceived it then was the art of per-
suading the public that you know what
you’re writing when you don’t.”
Webb acquired a fluent and ex-
pressive style of journalism in a
rough-and-tumble school along with
such tough travellers on the Inky Way
of the Western Goldfields as “Dry-
blower” Murphy, Billy Clare, “Smiler”
Hales, Jack Drayton and “Bluebush”
Bourke. C. W. A. Hayward (“T, the
R.” of The Bulletin), who was with
Webb in the West, once said: “We
journalists in the early days of the gold-
fields, even before ‘Smiler’ Hales arrived
at Coolgardie, hadn’t much to learn from
Pott or Slurk,” and he recalled the words
of a morose writer who stigmatised a
reptile contemporary as “bearing every
sign of being run by a cranky coster-
monger, set up in a blind asylum, inked
with inferior cartgrease and printed on a
mangle.” But James Edmond’s writing in
The Bulletin was always an inspiration
to John Webb.
“Dryblower” Murphy’s work,* Webb
always argued, was “as racy of its kind
as anything written in Australia.” “Dry-
blower” wrote “This Bit o’ the World
Belongs to Us,” one of the popular songs
of the 1914-18 war, and his early rhymes
in the “Verse and Worse” column of the
“Sunday Times” were published in book
form and dedicated “to the lads with
whom I have rocked the dishes in
pioneering days who now read me on
chaffbag stretchers outback.”
“Bluebush” Bourke, who went to the
West in ’94 and roughed it there for 12
years, was another “Verse and Worse”
contributor during Webb’s time. “Blue-
bush” —he was christened John Philip—
was quite a character. For five years he
was in charge of a small school on the
N.S.W.-Queensland border. “I stayed at
that game for about five years,” wrote
Bourke to a friend, “and resigned to
escape the sack because of whisky and
neglect of duty. The women declared
that I was so seldom on view at the
school that their children did not know
me.” “Bluebush” wrote a good deal of
verse for The Bulletin during its infancy
as “J.8.P.” and “J.P.8.”
Three years after kicking-off with the
“Miner,” Webb was grabbed by the Perth
“Sunday Times,” and he had not long
turned 23 when he was made editor:
“chiefly, I imagine,” he wrote to A. G.
Stephens, “because ther'e was nobody
else on the staff at the time.”
In those days the “Sunday Times” was
a paper of enormous bulk, and its young
editor —he was a glutton for work till
his retirement —would have written the
issue himself every week if he had not
to knock off now and then to eat and
sleep. His slashing pen bought him
plenty of strife, and for 15 years he
was the most influential editor in the
Sandgroper State. “The crooked poli-
ticians, the fly-by-night speculators and
all the shady spielers who flocked to the
West from the eastern States,” com-
mented an old cobber, “would have
gladly strung Jack Webb to the nearest
lamp-post in St. George’s-terrace if
they’d had the guts.”
Towards the end of his stay with the
“Sunday Times” he often crossed pens
with John Curtin, who had resigned as
secretary of the Victorian Timber
Workers’ Union to edit the “Westralian
Worker.” Political opposites, the two
young editors were friends until Curtin’s
death in 1945. “Our offices adjoined and
we used to discuss the war and the 1917
elections on a common footpath,” re-
lated Webb, recalling his early friend-
ship with his rival after Curtin died.
“He was then 32,” said Webb; “well
set-up, newly-married and keen to make
good, as he did, as editor of the
‘Westralian Worker’.” Even when he was
war-time Prime Minister, Curtin found
time when he was in Sydney to call
upon Webb at The Bulletin office for
a yarn about the old days in Perth.
More than likely mention would be
made of Eddy Dunn, who, in his late
years, edited the Sydney “Labor Daily”
and wrote reams of bright copy for The
Bulletin. A stout, red-haired, jolly-
looking man, with a drawling voice and
a dry humor, Eddy was a sub-editor on
Brisbane “Truth” in Norton’s time, and
was sent West to edit Perth “Truth,”
where he made something of a political
as well as a journalistic reputation.
In 1920 S. H. Prior persuaded Webb
to join The Bulletin as a political
writer. John Storey was N.S.W. Labor
Premier at the time, and “Honest Jack”
and his henchmen, especially Motherhood
Minister Greg McGirr and Carlo Lazza-
rini, who ran the tottering State Indus-
trial Enterprises, were soon to feel the
sting of Webb’s pen.
The new recruit was equally at home
as a writer of light verse as well as edi-
torials and political paragraphs. Old-
timers on the staff still recall his early
rhymes that appeared at the top of the
first column of the “Political Points”
page above the initials “D.E.,” an abbre-
viation of “Dimanchet Empson,” a pen-
name he had used in the West.
S. H. Prior always insisted that a
journalist who could turn his hand to
topical verse made a first-class sub-
editor, and in making appointments to his
staff invariably selected a writer who, in
addition to his other qualifications, could
be trusted to produce a poem on any
subject at very short- notice. When
Webb made his home in Sydney ail The
Bulletin staff men of the period were
accomplished writers of rhymed com-
ments on current happenings. Prior him-
self could furnish a lively set of stanzas,
and the weekly “topicals” by Ernest
O’Ferrall, David McKee Wright, John
Dailey, Arthur Adams and John Barr
were among the brightest features of the
paper.
It was S. H. Prior who asked Webb, in
1922, to look out for someone who could
write a couple of topical verses every
week for The Bulletin and who could
fill a temporary vacancy on the staff.
Webb, about to return to the West for
a short holiday, remembered his old
friend C. W. A. Hayward, who had been
delighting readers on the other side of
the continent with his polished rhymes as
far back as the early ’nineties, and who
had published a book of verse called
Along the Road to Cue. Hayward—son
of a South Aus. pioneer, Oxford graduate,
barrister in South Africa and Kalgoorlie
“Sun” editor —consented to make the
journey east and fill the gap on The
Bulletin staff for a few months,
although, as he confessed to Webb, he
didn’t feel that he would be long in this
world. Hayward was in his middle fifties
at the time, and now, well in his eighties,
is still going as strong as ever. No Bul-
letin rhymer can compete with him for
she.er quantity of output. By now he is
miles ahead of such prolific writers of
light verse as Dennis, Dyson, Murphy
and Goodge.
As a writer of vers de societe, Dennis,
in Webb’s opinion, was not above W. T.
Goodge, who, as an ingenious versifier
on topical subjects, had few rivals in
Australia. Goodge was a rhyming
dictionary on two energetic legs. It was
Webb’s contention that Dennis imitated
Goodge, and that Dennis’s “Australaise”
would never have been written if Goodge
had not imagined that “sunburnt
stockman” apostrophising his “
cuddy.” Goodge’s first verse, a six-line
stanza giving his unprintable opinion of
the manager of Wingadee station, where
he was employed as a jackeroo, and the
owners, Cobb and Co., was carved with
a penknife on the smooth trunk of a
bluegum-tree. Webb knew both “Aus-
tralaise” and Goodge’s “Great Australian
Adjective” by heart, as he did most of
the best Australian bush ballads, and was
seldom stuck for the source of a quota-
tion.
In many respects his memory was
extraordinary. Having kept a sharp eye
on the doings of Federal politicians since
the dawn of the century his familiarity
with the Federal scene was understand-
able, but his colleagues never ceased to
marvel at his ability to recite the names
of candidates for long-forgotten contests
or to reel off election figures until the
clocks ran down. Needing a reference
contained in the body of an article written
by himself in the long ago, he would
walk into the file-room, pull a half-year
volume from the shelves and locate the
reference he was seeking in a matter of
a few minutes. Yet he couldn’t tell you
his own telephone number.
An incident that reveals Webb’s
ability to forget everything but the job
in hand happened one press-day. Webb
had his head down busily ripping a
“Plain English” article to pieces. A
visitor peered around the door and said
“Good morning, Mr. Webb. I’m your
tenant. I’ve come to pay the rent.”
“Yes, yes, old cjiap,” answered Webb, as
he slashed a paragraph to shreds. The
caller dived a hand into a coat pocket
and brought forth a small wad of notes.
“It comes to ten pounds fifteen for the
month,” he said, as Webb continued to
stab furiously at the galley-proof. “It’s
ten fifteen,” repeated the visitor. “Ten
fifteen is it —ten fifteen?” replied Webb,
opening a drawer of his desk and pulling
out a cheque-book. He scribbled wildly
for a few seconds, tore out a cheque and
thrust it into the visitor’s hand. “Take
it up to Mr. Amery, the accountant.
He’ll cash it for you,” said Webb, as he
turned to the proof on his table and
resumed his determined stabbing.
When John Dailey left The Bulletin
in 1924 to edit Melbourne “Punch,” S.
H. Prior made Webb his associate editor.
It was while he filled that role that Webb
made Bulletin history by his thunder-
ing denunciations of J. T. Lang.
On June 6, 1933, S. H. Prior died and
Webb was made ,the new editor. His
eulogy of his late chief, printed in the
issue following Prior’s death, was a fine
tribute to a friend and a great editor. “S.
H. Prior,” wrote Webb, “has left his staff
an example of lofty endeavor and
achievement, of modesty, generosity and
unselfishness which will not cease to be
an inspiration.”
As an editor, Webb was a writer of
high purpose, and with what is very rare
in contemposary journalism—a witty,
polished and distinguished prose style.
He took his politics seriously, and when
tackling an opponent sailed into the argu-
ment with both hands fighting. His long
memory stood him in good stead, and
he was fond of reviving indiscreet and
forgotten statements by some politician
he was attacking, to the confusion and
discomfort of the same politician. In his
distrust of Communism Webb was years
ahead of other editors of his time.
In the office he endeared himself to
every member of the staff, and was just
as modest, generous and unselfish as his
predecessor. He was as friendly to a new
printer’s devil as to a valued contributor,
and was on speaking terms with every
compositor and machinist in the place,
with whom he would yarn about horses,
prize-fights and cricket. An untiring
writer and constantly swamped in a sea
of printer’s proofs, he delegated to his
secretary most of the trying task of
handling the army of callers that invade
a newspaper office from morning to night.
Should, however, some visitor find his
way to the editor’s room Webb would
go to no end of trouble to make the caller
at home.
In the 28 years he was with The
Bulletin Webb’s habit of always work-
ing at a high pressure never slackened,
and he would only take holidays for
brief periods and at rare intervals. Nor
was there any change in his avoidance of
attempts to arrange any ceremony in his
honor. A few months back the writers
and artists who had worked with him
wished to give him a Percy Lindsay oil-
painting as a mark of their affection. A
bullock-team couldn’t have dragged him
to the proposed handing-over of the
painting. One of the staff had to carry
the painting—a pleasant view of Sydney
Harbor from near Bradley’s Head —to his
home, silently deposit it on his front
doorstep at night and as silently depart.
His old staff still chuckle when they
remember Cecil Mann’s delightful pen-
picture of him on the “Red Page” of
The Bulletin’s Jubilee Number;
He is solid-looking, without being stocky;
of medium height; an Etna of nervous
energy. He drifted around W.A. before
drifting into George-street, to take off his
coat, waistcoat and collar, and for some
reason, doubtlessly known to himself, to
dart purposefully about the building snap-
ping his fingers and wearing his necktie
like an orphaned halter around his collarless
throat. He has the most ruthless disrespect
for the appearance of “copy” of any
journalist I know. He literally seizes it,
crunches it into a ball, stuffs it into a
pigeonhole or into his pocket. In moments
when inspiration is flagging, or logic refus-
ing to come right in a leader, or when he
is liking Lang a bit less than usual, he
walks about his jumbled cubicle like a
caged lion waving a white handkerchief.
On Melbourne Cup Day Webb called
into 252 George-street to have a yarn
with members of his old staff. He looked
fit and brown after a few months in the
sun, and no one would be surprised to
see him in action again. He could write
—among other things—a fascinating
book of reminiscences.

Various Verse
Wonga Vine.
Look down; be still.
The sunburst day's on fire,
oh twilight bell,
flower of the wonga vine.
I gather you
out of his withering light.
Sleep there, red;
sleep there, yellow and white.
Move as the creek
moves to its hidden pool.
The sun has eyes of fire;
be my white waterfall.
Lie on my eyes like hands ;
let no sun shine —
oh twilight bell,
flower of the wonga vine.

Losses.
When I lost my friend I whispered
“Why ?”
Then I found a thousand words at call,
A clamor beating against a wall
Of deafness lifting into the sky;
No passion ripped in a single cry
But an echoing and continual
Babble —till suddenly I must fall
Silent in shame of no reply
To the thousand words that were only
“Why ?”
When you went away I said “Goodbye,”
I said “Goodbye” and that was all.

Now.
What is the past ?
It is one vast
Efficient cause
Working through old, inexorable laws.
What is the future then
That lies beyond our ken ?
It is one vast effect;
“Remember” gently glides into “expect.”
Our vivid present ? how
Must we think of “now” ?
Gods know it not but we
Here find our only known reality.

ARNOLD WALL.
To a Certain Novelist.
You have disrobed these powerless
characters
Not of material clothes, of linen or silk,
Not of their cloaks or down to the very
holes
In their stockings, but of pretence, laying
bare their souls.
“Tell me, young woman, tell me can you
sew ?”
“Ah, yes, to stitch this robe was ten years’
work,
That now is wrenched from off my naked
mind
Revealing my most hidden thought, the
quirk.
The utmost quibble of my intelligence:’
“Now, sir, was it expensive, did you pay
For that fine suit ?” “Truly the best de-
ception
Embroidered it before it was snatched
away.”
And here, a child, not crying but be-
wildered.
Dissected accurately, not with a knife;
Left cold, unclad, skilfully plundered of
Garments intended to veil his coming life.
Beauty is to be found in this exposure,
In their unhampered gestures, their naked-
flCSS •
Wonder for the onlooker at this precision
And pity, for such sudden strange distress.
Yet, since only by probability
They still are governed, they cannot fly
like birds ,
Into other dimensions —you have robed
them again
In the fresh fabrics of incisive words.
Nudity is too tenuous for a story;
A bare cold blade itself disturbs no
SCTISCS *
Only the flourish, the sriift deliberate
intent
Terrifies. You must find your new pre-
tences ;
Interest not in clarity but repression,
Short syllables for joy, long cadence of
pain ~
Weave in and out and over, ever dis-
semble.
—The atmosphere is mystery again.

Recipe for making mead?
It is usual to use only honey which
is thin or not very suitable for sale
( or table use, many old beekeepers
making use of the comb, and adding
a little more honey to get the right
strength. To every gallon of water
use 41b. of honey. Put in the thinly-
pared rind of two lemons and boil
for half an hour, skimming carefully.
Strain into a perfectly clean tub, put
in a toast spread with brewers’ yeast
and cover the tub with a coarse cloth.
In about four days pour into a cask,
leaving the bunghole lightly stoppered
so that the yeast may work out. As
soon as it has ceased working, bung
down tightly and allow to remain
six months before bottling. It is
important that air should not get at
the liquor while it is working, so the
cask must be quite full. Hie longer
it is kept in the cask the better it is.

Scientific name of the common

literature on control
There are three or more mtroducea
species of clothes-moths fo UI ?d com-
monly in Australia, and of these the
webbing clothes-moth, Tineola bisel-
liella, is perhaps best entitled to
called the common clothes-moth. At
damage to clothing is done
larval or caterpillar stage. 88
take a variable amount of tune i
hatch out, owing to changes in tem-
perature and the time of the Y >
for these moths, being 1 / ldoo , r '
dwellers, are not influenced by - toa
seasons to the same extent, pern P »
as outdoor insects. Thus in the vai -
ous stages of ,the life-history, egg,
larva, pupa to adult, the development
will be accelerated in summer and
retarded in winter and the colder
months. There is no time of the year
when clothing is entirely sate from
their depredations. For eontrol

How to rid a swimming-pool of
stinging beetles? 0
The Australian Museum, Sydney,
advises that aquatic beetles (or other
kinds of beetles) do not sting. Certain
aquatic bugs such as the baek-
swimmer, Enithares bergrothi, ot the
family Notonectidce, have been re-
corded by Hale as possessing a sting
similar to that of a bee sting.
It would be necessary to send
specimens to the Aust. Museum
for comparison to determine the in-
sect with any degree of accuracy.
Derris dust would probably be found
effective in controlling these aquatic
insects.

Little CYPRESS PINE
By E.A.GOLLSHEWSKY.
BENNY came run-
ning across the
fallow field, his
thin brown legs
cutting through the air
like flaying blades, the
top of his lady’s straw
hat flapping up and
down like a hinged lid.
“Hi, Dad. Hi, Mum. Hi, there!” His
piercingly shrill voice floated before him,
into the great shambles of a house, and
on to the front verandah where Granny
Hercourt sat aggressively knitting.
She straightened her ramrod back a
little more, and listened.
t < in the mud again. Right
J—' up to ’er belly. And, by cripes, the
tide’s coming in.” Not a hint of breath-
lessness punctuated those words, and his
pace never slackened for an instant. He
slid, like a scuttling goanna, under the
railing fence, and came through the crowd
of startled fowls at the same smacking
pace. Young Mrs. Hercourt, who was
fifty-one, and plump, unworried over
life’s trifles, calm as a mill-pond, with
the limpid eyes and rather futile cheer-
fulness which never cheers, emerged from
the kitchen beating a sponge-cake.
“It’s Benny,” she called to the house-
hold-telling them something they already
knew.
Her husband sat up in the squatter’s
chair where he’d been lying half asleep
after his heavy Sunday dinner.
Benny gained the four steps that ran
down from the back verandah, and he
flung himself on the topmost one almost
at a bound.
“I seen her meself,” he announced im-
portantly. “If I hadn’t seen her she’d ’a’
died. Bogged right tp the belly, and
bawling her head off.”
“Oh, dear, that Duchess again. Last
time she went in there after mangroves I
said it would be the death of her.”
Swearing, her husband put aside the
paper he had finished reading long ago,
and reached for his boots. He was a
tall, thin man, brown-skinned, with grey
fuzz showing on his cheeks, and encircling
the bald patch on the top of his head. His
eyes were brown and rather blank, and
blinked a lot. His mouth trooped, and
looked as if it didn’t laugh often. A
humorless face, from which peeped out a
defeated soul. He had been beaten at
birth,
“Now then, Herbie,” his wife ad-
monished automatically. “It’s that dry
you can’t blame the poor cows for look-
ing out for a bit of green picking for
themselves. How’d you like to live on
that, week in, week out?” Her eyes lifted
from the yellow froth in the basin to the
wide paddocks that ringed the house.
EVERYWHERE the red earth was
clearly visible, and the little, rough,
pebbly stones that lay on the surface,
sliding loosely away from unwary feet.
The grass was brown, wiry strands, wav-
ing in the transient breeze. There was no
greenery in sight, until the eyes rested on
the lavish S of the river lined with man-
groves. And on each side of the river lay
the mud-flats, wide expanses of black
mud veined by cracks and rimmed with
lines of salt.
It was over these flats that the hungry
cattle, with protruding hip-bones and
black-lustre eyes, wandered in search of
a little succulent feed. The branches of
the mangroves were tasty and life-sustain-
ing. In worse droughts they had been
cut down for fodder, and the cattle had
acquired a taste for them. Now, as the
dry interval lengthened they wandered
ever more and more frequently to the
banks of the slow silver river.
“Granny wants to know what’s up.
Granny says if the cows are in the melon-
patch again it’s your own fault be-
cause she gave you a looking-glass to
hang there, and you said a dead cow was
better than any blazing looking-glass.
Granny says”
“Blast Granny.” The girl who had just
arrived on the back verandah accepted
this advice quietly. She leaned against the
open door, scratching one leg with the
foot of the other. It was a bare foot,
brown and slim, with an arching instep.
She watched while her father gathered
ropes and chains together, rescued his hat
from a slavering blue cattle pup, and
made a hurried search for the pipe that
had slipped from his relaxing mouth,
“It’s Duchess.” Young Mrs. Hercourt
explained placatingly. She was breathing
heavily now. Her big, soft bosom rose
and fell hurriedly, and beads of perspira-
tion had gathered on her top lip.
“Bogged again.” She had no
breath to spare for unneces-
sary phrases.
Benny looked up at his
sister, pride and excitement
in his face.
“I found her,” he asserted.
“I was looking for beehives
down by the old sugar-gum,
and I seen the sun on her horns. She’s
up to ’er belly.”
“Then how d’ y’ know it’s Duchess?
You can’t see the white patch on her
underside if she’s in mud that deep.” The
girl’s voice was argumentative/ Her
brown eyes, round and sombre, rested on
the boy’s freckled face, disbelief in their
depths. Her hair was dark, curly and
untidy, like her mother’s.
“Who in hell would it be on a Sunday
afternoon but Duchess? Ever since the
flaming thing was calved she’s been a
nuisance. If it wasn’t breaking fences it
was getting into lucerne or corn patches.
I’ll Duchess her —Bessie, where in blazes
is my pipe?”
“I never touched it, dear.” Young Mrs.
Hercourt’s breath was a mere series of
pants now. The wisp of hair on her
damp forehead lifted dreamily only to
drop again.
Benny looked a little crestfallen. He
reached for the pup, and hugged it up to
his chest. It licked his face with a joyous
red tongue.
“ ’Course it’s Duchess,” he said uncer-
tainly.
“Ag, you go quick and get the black
mare harnessed.” Her father flung the
words over his shoulder as he turned
cushions and shook out the faded rug.
“Soon’s I find me pipe I’ll be with you.
Go on, Benny, lend a hand to your sister.”
The girl went slowly, her hands folded
behind her back. Benny hopped along
beside her, the lid of his hat popping up
and down with every movement.
“I wish it’d rain,” she said resentfully.
“Nothing but knocking calves on the head
and pulling cows out of bogs, and stinks
all round the place.' Dry weather stinks.”
“It can’t, Ag. A thing like weather
can’t stink.”
“Yes it does. It stinks of dust and
rot” Her breath caught in her
throat. “It stinks worse’n a dead
snake”
“You’re only saying that because Sam
hasn’t been over.” The boy’s shrewd
eyes lit with delight when she flushed a
bright pink. “If it’d rain he wouldn’t
have to tail the cows on the Reserve, and
he’d get over on week-ends.”
“I hate Sam Wessell. I don’t care if I
never see him. Him and his miserable
little Jerseys—they can’t stand up to a
bit of hard going. I told him to cross ’em
with Herefords, but he’s that stubborn.
No wonder they’re dying like flies.”
Her mood changing, she lifted her voice
into a carolling sweet as a magpie’s, and
went swinging over the paddocks to
where the old black mare browsed in a
corner, with her lip hanging and off hind-
leg resting on the toe of its hoof.
BENNY rode the mare, his thin legs
gripping the hairy sides, his wiry
hands holding on to the ropes and chains
hanging around her neck.
The girl and her father strode along be-
side the cumbrous mare, the man
morosely silent, the girl looking around
her at the barren, dying countryside,
“Hulbert’s dam’s dry,” she proffered, as
a choice piece of information. “They’re
carting watef from Riley’s.”
“That’ll get ’em nowhere. I told him
in the ’thirties drought to put a well down
on the west slope. I divined it, so I ought
to know.”
Agnes sighed. It was hot in the glaring
sun without her hat. If only it would
rain . . .
As they drew near the river, a faint
lowing could be heard.
“That’s her, Dad,” Benny cried
triumphantly. “That’s Duchess.”
“Don’t be so sure it’s Duchess. It
could be Lucy—she’s got a head like
Duchess.”
They argued hotly, to relieve the
tedium. Herb Hercourt strode on, scarcely
hearing. Once he stopped short and
looked around him at the bright blue
sky, with its veil of tiny scudding clouds ;
at the desolation of the cultivation that
only a few weeks before had been sprout-
ing tiny green spears of maize between
the red furrows.
“By God! A man’s a fool!” he ejacu-
lated. The girl and boy looked at him
and said nothing.
THE tide was coming in. It lay, a
silver, undulating shadow over the face
of the mud. The red cow had given up
her struggles, and stood, firmly embedded,
with her horns waving grotesquely above
her back.
They were a long time getting her out.
She was terrified, and struggled franti-
cally against their efforts to release her.
The black mare’s great muscles hunched
and strained, her back sagged in the
middle and her hindquarters floundered.
“She’s coming. Dad!” yelled Benny,
watching intently. “Slip it round her
guts! Now”
The mud covered their clothes and
stuck to their arms. Hercourt blustered
and swore, and everything went wrong.
In the end they had her on firm ground,
covered with wet mud that would dry and
cake all over her, adding to her miseries.
She didn’t want to stand. Saggingly, she
drooped to the ground, exhausted beyond
the point of further effort. Twice they
lifted her, with Hercourt holding her
straining head and Agnes lifting her by
the upended tail. In the end they let her
lie, with her head lolling on the ground.
“You kid’s ’ll have to bring her water
and feed,” Hercourt said, looking down at
her without pity. On a Sunday afternoon
to go and get into such a mess . ..
“I’ve got to get the cows in,” Benny
said, quickly looking up at the sinking
sun. “Aggie’ll have to do it.”
He rode off on the black mare, whose
sides were wet with sweat, and whose
chains rattled as she walked.
“Agnes! ” her father said, without look-
ing at her. He trudged away, leaving her
with the cow.
She took water in a bucket, a few
precious handfuls of silage, and put them
where they could be easily reached. The
cow drank thirstily, but would not eat.
THE girl put out a finger, and stroked
the coarse red hair between the dull
eyes. Soon, if it didn’t rain, they’d be
dying like flies. It was terrible to see them
falling, one by one, until the herd was
wiped out. She had seen it happen before.
She was surprised to find tears were drop-
ping on to the hard, red, pebbly soil.
She felt sorry she had refused to get
water for Granny Hercourt last night
when she called. The helpless cow re-
minded her of Granny—only the old
woman was indomitable and unbeaten.
The cow was defeated.
The sun went down. She should be
over at the bails now, helping with the
milking. Benny would tell on her, and
her mother would nag about it. But she
couldn’t go yet. There seemed no
strength left in her. There was no
pleasure in working, no interest in strip-
ping udders that were nearly dry before
you started. Everything was at a dead-
end . . .
After a while the cow ate a little, her
jaws moving listlessly. The girl got up,
mud stiffening in flakes on her
arms and legs. Her dress had
been a clean blue one, but now
it was filthy, and, she thought,
“Stinkin’ like everything else.”
She bent, and picked up a
handful of the loose soil. It
was dug in, under her finger-
nails. It was under her father’s
nails, too, and her grand-
mother’s.
“The best soil this side of the
river,” her father often said. “All
it needs is a drop of rain at the
right time.”
Her baby sister was buried in it.
Benny’s future was vested in it, irre-
vocably, because he loved, lightly,
happily, eternally, every inch of the far-
flung paddocks. He knew no other life,
hungered for nothing else.
When the girl went into the house at
last the lamps were lit, flooding the rooms
with warm yellow light. Her mother
looked up dishing the evening meal and
spoke brightly,
“Have a wash, dear, and I’ll keep your
tea warming. Don’t take any notice of
Granny if she rouses about the water.
It’s left over from the aprons I washed,
anyway.”
AGNES opened her tightly clenched
hand and* stared, surprised, at the
dirt in her palm. She had clung to it in
her distress. Funny, that. She let it fall
into the small palm plant that stood in
a corner of the room. What was the use
of washing, and getting dolled up, and
going to a lot of trouble? Sam- wouldn’t
come tonight. He was otfer at the reserve,
beside a lovely campfire, sitting plaiting
whips, probably.
He always smelt of raw-hide and dis-
infectant. Everybody said he was as good
as a vet. any day, but it made him smell
horrible. She wished he smelt of soap and
clean clothes, like the schoolteacher did.
Granny heard her washing, and shrilled
out a chain of bitter invective against
wasting water. Agnes sang, to shut out
the cracked old voice. It reminded her
of the lowing of the trapped cow, a
futile noise beating against the doom that
threatened it. Granny was ninety-eight.
A wonderful woman, the neighbors-said.
Agnes hated and pitied her at the same
time.
Tea was finished when she reached the
kitchen. Her father, sitting before the
fire, was talking politics to her mother.
He couldn’t possibly break off to repri-
mand his erring daughter. He glared at
her, and went on talking, while his wife
silently worked out domestic details in
her mind. She always managed to look
deeply interested, but had discovered long
ago that no response from her was called
for.
AGNES, freshly bathed, with her hair
combed out damply, sat and ate the
cold meat and pickles listlessly. Every
night it was the same. Only on Saturdays
was there any fun, when a dance was
held at the school. But last night there
had been no dance, because the men were
all out at .O’Hagans’ beating out a fire.
She had put on a thin white dress, too
small for her months ago. It pulled tight
across her chest, and cut into her arm-
pits. Looking down at the taut cotton
voile she realised how big she was getting.
Some day she’d be like her mother, soft
and great and flowing. But by then she’d
have known a lot of things. She’d have
had children of her own.
Restlessly, she put down her knife and
fork, and began to clear the table. What
was the use of anything? Where did it
get you?
She dried dishes as her mother washed
them, automatically, watching the polish
come up on the cheap china. Her father’s
voice flowed round them, encompassing
them. Why did he bother? What did it
matter if a subsidy carried them over this
year? What about next year? There was
no hope on the land.
BENNY came in, a dozen or so moths
fluttering frantically from a long
thread of green cotton. He’d been sitting
by a lamp, catching them, piercing them
with a needle while still alive and thread-
ing therh like a necklace.
Agnes reached out and hit him over
the head. “You rotten little cow,” she
burst out, breaking into her father’s pas-
sionate monologue. “Take that, and
that”
Benny dashed behind his mother’s vast
hips, and peeped round, ugly and shrewd,
like a little brown-faced monkey.
“I won’t tell y’ now!” he hooted de-
risively, “I was going to, but now I
won’t. Find out for yourself!”
“Now, now, you two.” Young Mrs.
Hercourt patted his rough head lovingly.
“At it again. It’s wrong to be cruel,
Ben. That’s real cruel, that is.”
He held up the string and gazed at it
admiringly.
“Three different sorts I got.”
“By God, son. I’ll tan the backside out
of your pants one of these days.” Herbie
Hercourt leaned back in his
easy-chair and put up his feet.
He was an easygoing man, but
discontented with his own good
nature. He felt he should be
doing something more, but didn’t
know how to rid himself of
the spiritual lethargy that pos-
sessed him.
“Make him tell, Mum,” Agnes
glared at him suspiciously. He
was always first to know any-
thing. You never knew what
he’d ferreted out.
“Go on, Benny.” Young Mrs.
Hercourt cajoled comfortingly. “Tell us,
there’s a good boy;”
“COMEBODY’S coming down the
Three-mile,” Benny chanted sud-
denly, hopping on one foot. “I heard
the bridge rattle.”
“Cattle!” scoffed Agnes. “Or Tracy’s
horses,” But her eyes brightened. The
schoolteacher had promised to bring her
over some books one night. Perhaps it
was him on his bicycle. They’d all been
teasing her about him since the last dance,
after the way he asked her for three
dances running.
“No. It’s only one horse, and canter-
ing” Benny dug his mother in her
well-covered ribs and they laughed
heartily.
Color burnt up into Agnes’s cheeks.
She dropped the tea-towel and hurried
out of the kitchen into the long, dark
hall, on to the dim, moonlit verandah
that overlooked the straggling, shrub-
choked garden.
Hoofbeats on the road. Clippety-
clops that dropped to a soft, walking
gait as they neared the gate.
Agnes felt the heat go out of her cheeks.
The tightness that had been like a knot
in body and mind suddenly relaxed.
Through the still, cool air she heard
Sam’s voice gently urging Roamy to
“Hold still.”
She saw him then, coming up the
path, the horse’s bridle over one arm,
and he was sharply silhouetted in the
moonlight. Great, wide shoulders, bandy
{Continued foot of page 7.)


legs, a small felt hat pulled low over
his eyes.
<t\X/HO’S out there?” shrilled Granny
VV from her darkened bedroom.
“Ag,” the girl replied, her voice soft
and low. Perhaps the poor old thing
wanted something, and she’d been good
to them all, always.
“Get my smelling-salts. I left them
out there on the ledge.”
The girl took them in to the old
woman. Sam was putting his horse away
in the stable. She felt patient and gener-
ous towards everybody. It was no trouble
to fix the rugs on the old woman’s
bed and attend to her,
“There now. All set?” she asked
cheerfully.
“As good as can be,” the wheezy old
voice crackled grudgingly. “Not that
anybody cares.”
Agnes laughed. The moon, shining
through the window, silvered the snowy
counterpane, touched with glory the
crown of white hair above the old
woman’s bad-tempered face.
“Sam came,” she offered, in the warm
tone of a special confidence. “I didn’t
expect him, but he came.”
Granny Hercourt grunted, and half-
turned her hunched shoulder.
“They’d get through anywhere,” she
said grumpily. “They’re all the same —
when it comes to a female.”
Agnes laughed again, and went out of
the room. Granny was too old to re-
member that there were other things be-
side what she thought about. Sam
wasn’t like that. You could tell by the
way the O’Hagan girl had chased him,
and everybody knew what she was; Sam
hadn’t bothered about her.
HE was standing on the verandah near
the pawpaw-tree that leaned in under
the galvanised-iron roof, heavy with great
hard ovals of green fruit.
“We didn’t expect you,” she said, go-
ing up beside him.
He shuffled. “There was nothing much
to do. And I wanted that double-M
branding-iron of your Dad’s.”
This was ritual, and unwritten law.
There had to be some cover under which
he hid his real reason for coming.
“It’s awfully dry,” she said. The dew
was on the creamy pawpaw flowers, caus-
ing them to exude a perfume unbearably
sweet. The great fan-shaped leaves were
cool and green against her cheek. Some-
how the dry weather didn’t matter so
much. Night dew had temporarily laid
the dust, moonlight lent beauty to grass-
less paddocks and stark ring-barked trees.
There was only the purity and loveliness,
the cool and the sweetness of a summer
night. The drought seemed remote, un-
real. “But it can’t go on for ever. It
must rain soon.”
“That’s right, Ag.” He drew his hand
from behind his back. It held a pre-
served-fruit-tin, in which was planted a
small cone-shaped pine-tree. When the
sharp, hard leaves brushed his chest, an
odor, sharp and tangent, speaking of
green forests and deep shadows, filled
the air. “Look what I found for you.
It’s a little cypress-pine. You can plant
it by the tank-stand at the back, where
it’ll catch the drip from the tap.”
HER exploring finger delved down into
the tin. Hard, damp, gravelly dirt,
which she knew to be the same as her
father’s, bright red when dry, dark red,
almost black, when wet. Sam’s place
adjoined the Hercourts’. All it needed
was plenty of rain—at the right time,
Sam’s soil —if she were to tip it out on
to her father’s paddock you wouldn’t
tell the difference, once the water dried
out of it. The little pine-tree would
scarcely notice the change when it was
transplanted. Its roots would delve down
and take hold, just as they had done in
the red gravel of Sam’s place.
“You’re crying,” Sam said wonder-
ingly.
“No. Pine-trees don’t cry,” she said
queerly, and the prickle leaves of the
little plant pierced the thin voile of her
dress, pricking her breast sharply.
MAN SCOTT'S CASKS
By DON EDWARDS
THE Scotts and the Gilberts were
neighbors. Their weatherboard
houses were beside each other down
on the main road past Carey’s pub,
and about a hundred yards from the high
bank of the creek.
The two cottages were exactly alike,
tan-colored, square boxes with corru-
gated-iron roofs, and wide verandahs
along the front.
Mrs. Scott and her husband lived in
the house closer to the creek. They had
eight children, the eldest a girl of sixteen,
all of them small, thin as gum-saplings
and as angular, with shrill voices and
quick, energetic if erratic movements that
sent them darting spasmodically in one
direction and then just as abruptly in
another. The children took after their
mother, whom they called Ida or Maw.
Scotty, their easygoing and fat father,
didn’t count at ail.
IF you saw any of the children, even
1 Fred the youngest, aged four, you saw
Mrs. Scott. She was a dominating per-
sonality, not only in her own home but
also in the whole township. Thin as a
crane, sharp as a blade of spear-grass,
and active as a water-spider, she
had a shrill and penetrating voice that
she threw at her opponents like a lance.
She would stand on her front verandah,
legs apart, long jaw thrust forward, and
hurl her vituperative comments at the
Gilberts, who stayed inside behind shut
doors and windows in an effort to ignore
her remarks till some astute and sharp
thrust got home, when Mr. Gilbert would
dash out and tell her what he thought of
her.
Somehow or other Jim Gilbert never
managed to think as badly of Mrs. Scott
as she did of him. He said he was ham-
pered by gentlemanly courtesy, but in
reality he hadn’t the imagination, the
vocabulary, or the intelligence of Maw
Scott. His wife would have been a better
mate for Scotty, being mild and placid.
The Gilberts had no children, a mis-
fortune that Maw Scott generally
managed to mention frequently.
The rivalry between the two families
started the day after the Gilberts moved
from the far side of the town into the
house next to Scott’s and put up new blue
curtains at the front windows,
“Huh, showing off, eh!” snorted Maw
Scott, whose windows had never carried
anything other than a faded torn square
of green material; but the following day
vivid red curtains leapt about like tongues
of flame in the hot wind that blew
through her windows.
Then the Gilberts bought a car, rather
an old car, and caused Mrs. Scott a
couple of weeks of bitterness, till she
went to town and bought a machine that
all the family referred to as “our car,”
but that the townspeople called the “chaff-
cutter.”
It was a delight to see the ten Scotts
clattering along the road in the “chaff-
cutter” looking as proud as eagles, with
Maw hanging on to the wheel grimly.
Poor Scotty never learnt to drive.
It was when the Gilberts started a
garden that the Scotts were really tested.
In the dry and droughty climate of the
locality gardens were a luxury.
“It’s all right for mugs like them,” she
said. “They’ve got two tanks of water for
two people, but we’ve got only the same
amount for ten people. No kids, huh! ”
Jim Gilbert worked hard, and soon his
garden began to blossom. His obvious
pride in it was too much for Maw Scott.
“Come on, you kids,” she shouted.
“Go round and borrow some tools.
We’re goin’ to start a garden.”
Soon the whole town was proud of the
Scott and Gilbert gardens.
For a time the gardens were so similar
in quality that people argued a lot as to
which was the better. Then the dry
summer weather began to tell on the
plants. Day after day was hot and dry,
with hardly a cloud in the brown, dusty
sky, and the water in the tanks getting
lower. Jim Gilbert took to tapping his
knuckles loudly and ostentatiously against
the rims of his tanks when Mrs. Scott
was working in her garden. He knew he
had more water than his neighbors, and
Maw Scott knew it, too.
“Why don’t you use of your
water to wash yourselves with?”
Jim Gilbert ignored her, but went
across and admired his three young
orange-trees.
“You pinched those trees, too. Maw
yelled at him. “Pinched them from Mrs.
Simpson, up at the store.”
“Well, see you don’t pinch any of the
oranges,” Jim retorted, and hurried in-
side.
A WEEK later, the brewery lorry from
town came roaring down the dusty,
red road with a load of big empty beer
barrels from Carey’s pub. Opposite Jim
Gilbert’s place one of the casks slid off
the back like a fat diver going into the
water, and sent up a spray of fine dust
from the road. Mrs. Scott and six of the
children stopped in their gardening to
look at it.
Jim Gilbert also stopped work to look
at the cask. Then, as if the idea had
come to all of them at the same instant,
Mrs. Scott, six of her children and Jim
Gilbert raced towards the barrel.
Jim hadn’t as far to go as his com-
petitors, so when they arrived he had
started the cask rolling towards his
garden. The Scotts stood in a semicircle
about him and stared at him; Jim leant
over with one hand on the cask and
stared back.
“That’s our barrel,” Mrs. Scott said.
Jim laughed and gave the cask a gentle
shove along its journey.
Mrs. Scott darted in and grasped* thp
cask. “That’s our barrel. We saw it first,
didn’t we?”
The six children nodded vigorously, but
Jim, unperturbed, pulled the cask away
from Mrs. Stott’s grip and shoved it
ahead again. »
“Go get it,” Maw snapped, peremp-
torily, at the children, and like a pack of
dogs they tore in on the surprised and
bewildered man, clutching his legs, hold-
ing his arms and toppling him over in the
dust. They were all over and round him,
busy and tenacious as ants round a beetle.
By the time Jim got free the
cask was installed in Maw’s garden, with
Maw standing guard over it, and the
children streaming back to reinforce her.
Jim made a brief gesture of angry de-
fiance against Maw’s derisive cackle, then
went inside and slammed the door.
“Just what we wanted,” Maw said
loudly, slapping the side of the cask
appreciatively. “We’ll fill it with water
from the creek and use it on the garden.”
The next day Carey, the publican, came
down “to see about the cask,” but after
enduring Mrs. Scott’s tongue for a few
minutes and noting the determined look
in her eyes he accepted the inevitable and
went back to the hotel.
Jim Gilbert still had some fight left in
him. He went to town in his car and re-
turned with a big barrel that he installed
in his garden and filled from the creek
that afternoon.
EARLY the following morning he was
awakened by a noisy procession of
Scotts coming from the creek with
buckets and tins of water which they
emptied into a second large cask that
stood squat and corpulent beside its twin.
Jim’s curiosity overcame him. “Where’d
you get that cask?” he shouted, as soon
as he had hurried out and quietened his
fears that it might be his own.
“Mind your own flaming business,
was Maw’s reply. “Hurry up, you kids;
another trip will fill it.”
Jim soon knew where the cask had
come from, for a very angry and flustered
publican appeared at the Scott cottage
claiming that the barrel had been stolen
during the night from his hotel and that
he would tell the sergeant. Mrs. Scott
threatened him with slander, libel and a
black eye, in language so expressive, vig-
orous and uncomplimentary, that he was
pleased to accept Jim Gilbert’s hospi-
tality, and shelter behind his shut door.
The dry weather continued, but with
the help of the two casks, always kept
full of water from the creek. Maw Scott’s
garden began to live again and grow
fresher and stronger like Maw Scott’s
exuberant comments on her neighbor and
his garden.
I IM, finding her superiority unbear-
U able, drove to town again, and that
afternoon he was able to stand proudly
beside a second cask, that he had filled
with water from the creek.
“And Carey has locked all his empty
barrels in the shed,” bellowed Jim. “And
he says if he catches you or your kids
round his pub he’ll shoot you.”
This was too much for Maw. She
rushed inside, but Jim’s guffaw of triumph
changed to a howl of consternation when
she appeared again with a rifle which she
levelled menacingly.
Jim leapt for shelter, the rifle cracked
four times, and the water in each cask
began to jet out from two holes. The
Scott children cheered, and laughed, and
scraped a gutter under the fence so that
the water could run on to their garden.
THAT night Jim Gilbert’s kitchen
caught on fire. It was a flimsy, de-
tached structure separated by a few yards
from the cottage, and by the time the
Scott family turned out it was well ablaze,
sending long flames licking towards the
main building.
Maw Scott, ignoring the Gilberts, took
charge at once, shrieking orders above
the crackling of the fire. Scotty and
the kids, obeying her commands, and
armed with buckets and cans, drained the
Gilbert tanks dry in an enthusiastic but
ineffectual attack on the fire. Maw Scott
herself heaved the last bucket of water.
Jim emerged from the house, dragging
a sofa. “What the hdl do you think
you are doing?” she asked. Its the
kitchen on fire, not the house.”
Jim darted in again, to appear with an
easy-chair,
“Look, Maw, the wall of the house is
smouldering,” one of the children said.
“So it is,” she replied. “But they’ve
used all their water. We can’t do any-
thing now.”
People from the other houses were
arriving. They joined the audience of
Scotts. The eldest Scott girl sidled up
to her mother. “Maw,” she said. “If
Gilbert’s house gets on fire the heat will
kill our garden.”
In a moment Mrs. Scott was a hurri-
cane of activity. “My Gawd ; yes, so it
will,” she yelled. “Here, you kids, pitch
the water from our casks on to that wall
there. Hurry up.”
There was no need to hurry the
children. They liked pitching water. In
half an hour the casks were empty, the
kitchen was a heap of smouldering beams
and glowing coals, and the cottage itself
was safe. So was the Scott garden.
Maw was triumphant.
Jim Gilbert began to carry his furniture
back, Maw looked on sardonically.
“Not a word of thanks,” she commented
loudly, so that the onlookers, already
drifting away, could hear her. “Where
would you have been only for the water
in our casks?”
I IM GILBERT threw down the chair
he was carrying and turned on Mrs.
Scott. “What about our own casks?” he
shouted, pointing dramatically at them.
“Who shot holes in them and let all the
water out?” He ran to the casks and
shoved his finger at the holes. “And
who set fire to our kitchen?” he yelled.
“I’d like to know. Who set fire to our
kitchen?”
For a second Maw Scott was dumb-
founded. By the time she recovered suf-
ficiently to dash at Jim he had got inside
and slammed the door.
“Well, I like that,” Maw said loudly,
addressing the night. “No gratitude. No
bloody gratitude at all.”


UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
WHY PEACE DELAYS.
The effort of Messrs. Lie and
Evatt at mediation in the Berlin
deadlock was given a practically
unanimous roasting in the U.S.
press, imputations of Soviet
sympathy being freely cast at
Mr. Lie, with Dr. Evatt let off
more lightly as merely a well-
meaning busybody.
Of all the rush of comment,
the most striking and impartial
noted was that of “Christian
Science Monitor’s” leading
Washington correspondent,
Joseph C. Harsch. Most com-
mentators saw at once the ob-
vious implication of the original
Lie-Evatt letter —that responsi-
bility for the deadlock fell
equally on both Soviet and
West; hence that Washington
and London could do more
than they have to make a settle-
ment possible. Harsch mainly
differs in accepting that that is
quite true.
Noting that the appearance of
reluctance on the Western side
has been additionally confirmed
by MarshaU-Yandenberg and
other opposition to a Stalin-
Truman conference at this time,
Harsch asserts that the Marshall-
Vandenberg (or U.S. policy)
assumption is that both the Lie-
Evatt mediation effort and the
propaganda for a Stalin-Truman
meeting fall in with “a specious
Moscow peace offensive which
is subtle, dangerous and to be
avoided at all costs.”
Harsch proceeds to look for
the reason why the principal
architects of American foreign
policy thus “risk putting them-
selves in the apparent position of
blocking developments which
some people believe might be
productive.” His analysis is on
the following lines:
The reason is strategic, and it
goes back to last winter’s deci-
sion to proceed with a German
Trizonia. At that time, Western
diplomacy took the initiative in
halting general negotiations with
Soviet Russia. Not since then
has the West attempted to do
much serious business with

THIS ONE?”
effort has been directed toward
avoiding agreements.
Here the reason is a concept
of bargaining power. Any major
international settlement must be
based on the relative bargaining
position of the two parties. Ac-
cording to Western strategists,
Russia has sought to reach
settlements at times when Russia
enjoys the advantage. And the
Western strategists have taken
in hand great projects which
have for their primary purpose
building Western bargaining
power. They have felt that con-
siderable improvement in the
Western position is in sight, but
they have been building for a
more favorable position still.
Therefore, they regard any
Russian manoeuvre to bring
matters to a settlement now as
an effort to reach a settlement
when the Western position is less
favorable than it will be. They
do not want a settlement now.
Time is working in favor of the
West. The European Recovery
Programme is beginning to
show results. Communism is
losing ground in France and
Italy. The West is moving
rapidly toward a mutual de-
fence system.
Those are all projects which
are building Western bargaining
power. And the unexpected
success of the Berlin air-lift has
made it possible to play for
time without risking the loss of
Berlin in the process.
Hence, Russia’s manoeuvres
are viewed as an effort to deny
to the West the advantages
which time is providing.
All that notwithstanding, the
writer insists that it would be
the greatest mistake to see in
the Western moves any real
effort to avoid peaceful settle-
ments: “At the very bottom of
the Marshall-Vandenberg ap-
proach is the belief that a settle-
ment is worth having only if it is
fair to both sides. They want
settlements, but not now, be-
cause they do not think the
Western position is yet strong
enough to produce a settlement
which would satisfy the West
and therefore enjoy a prospect
of being permanent.
“As they see it, they are not
blocking peace, but only a false
appearance of peace which could
not last. They are, consciously
and deliberately, trying to block
Moscow’s efforts to rush matters
at this stage. As they see it,
their worst enemy is impatience,
and Moscow is playing shrewdly
to Western impatience.”
J. Bull & Co. Today.
In an extensive review and
analysis in the American
quarterly “Foreign Affairs,”
Nicholas Mansergh, Professor
of British Commonwealth Rela-
tions at the Royal Institute of
International Affairs, poses the
question “Has the British Com-
monwealth of Nations been
fundamentally weakened since
1939?” and contends that it has
not.
Certainly, he admits, it has
suffered contraction of territory
through the secession of Burma.
Its military position in Asia
has been weakened by the
transfer of power in India, and
its position in the Middle East
has been damaged by the with-
drawal of troops from Egypt
and Palestine. It has sustained
heavy loss of economic resources
by destruction in war and by ex-
penditure in the waging of war.
But, though the final conse-
quences of these injuries can-
not be foretold, not all are
to be taken at their face value.
Was not, for example, a dis-
contented India as much a lia-
bility as an asset to the Com-
monwealth in 1939? In any
case, consequences of war-time
changes on the Commonwealth
are best judged not by an
analysis of economic or terri-
torial loss, but by their impact
upon its essential nature.
“The Commonwealth’s contri-
bution, said Field - Marshal
Smuts, ‘in human qualities of
balance and moderation, good
sense, good humor and fair play
are of a very special character.
They are worth more than scores
of divisions and without them
divisions must ultimately fail.’
.... No assessment of the posi-
tion of the Commonwealth in
the post-war world can neglect
these human and political
factors, for it is on them, for
good or ill, and not upon its
organisation of power or its
capacity to wage war, that the
Commonwealth is founded.
“The underlying strength of
the Commonwealth,” Professor
Mansergh concludes, “is that it
is united by a conception of a
world "order which transcends ex-
clusively Commonwealth in-
terests. It is this, reinforced by
a will toward friendly co-opera-
tion, that constitutes the most
impressive assurance of its
present and future cohesion.
For whatever the appearances at
international conferences may
seem to indicate, the Common-
wealth countries are probably
more closely knit today than at
any other time in history.
“The Communist challenge is
something no Dominion is pre-
pared to disregard. Even those
groups, like the Nationalists in
South Africa and some sections
of French-Canadian opinion,
who questioned whether the war
against Hitlerite Germany was
not another ‘imperialist’ war,
will have no such doubts about
any future war brought about by
Communist aggression. Their
own interests and their own way
of life are too closely and evi-
dently involved. All this is rele-
vant, also, to Eire, .who decided
to remain neutral in the 1939-45
war, but who now participates
as one of the 16 nations under
the European Recovery Pro-
gramme and has always been
profoundly anti-Communist,
“But while common resistance
to aggression is indispensable, it
is not enough. The Common-
wealth countries recognise that
the first aim of their policy must
be the preservation of peace, and
they have welcomed Britain’s
participation in Western Union
because they recognise that the
building up of a league of free
peoples within the broad frame-
.work of the United Nations is
the most practical means of
attaining it. Inevitably, any
union with Western Europe
which would involve loss of the
United Kingdom’s freedom of
action overseas or leave it unable
to fulfill the role outside Europe
which it has played in the past,
must raise profound misgivings
for the Dominions.
“Yet to regard the crystal-
lisation of Britain’s dual per-
sonality in international affairs
as bringing to the surface an
acute tension between the rival
claims of the overseas
Dominions and of Western
Europe is to see the whole in a
false perspective. Some imme-
diate difficulties may loom large,
but what is fundamental and
what makes a solution at once
desirable and practical is the fact
that the consolidation of Western
Europe could only safeguard the
Commonwealth by building up
a barrier against any aggressor
on the Continent. Here its in-
terest coincides with that of the
United States. This is a final and
all-important factor in the posi-
tion of the Commonwealth to-
day. As a result of the war and
of its aftermath, the Common-
wealth countries and the United
States are more closely linked
than ever before. The develop-
ment has been helped by the
existence of a common language,
but iL is conditioned by more
fundamental considerations, and
enhanced by the challenge which
now confronts both alike.”
China Crisis.
Comment in “Christian
Science Monitor” can be taken
as representative of the present
predominant American views on
the China upheaval:
“Many people continue to
bracket China and Europe to-
gether as roughly similar situa-
tions demanding comparable
American action. Certainly
China is no less important than
Europe—in the long run. Yet
for the highly developed coun-
tries of Western Europe, with
their mature political institutions
and huge industrial potential, to
—Memphis (U.S.A.) "Commercial”

CONQUERORS.
fall prey to Communism would
be far more catastrophic for
civilisation than a sweeping
victory of the Chinese Reds.
“The latter possibility can
hardly be regarded with com-
placency. It is fraught with
peril for the whole of Asia and
for vital Western interests there.
The United States is committed
to do all it can to prevent a
total victory of the Reds in
China. But there is general
agreement among realistic ob-
servers that what it can do is
little enough.
“American resources are not
unlimited. American aid to
Europe has been shaved danger-
qusly low, considering the stakes
there. To divert any substantial
portion of this aid to China
would imperil all the demo-
cratic forces in Europe—and
might accomplish little or no-
thing in China.”
Holding that “No victory of
the Chinese Reds could effect
an overnight transformation of
the Chinese way of life” or
bring about the unification of
China which has been aimed at
so often in vain—“ Time does
not move with rocket-speed in
China ; it lumbers along a dusty,
primitive road” —the “Monitor”
added: —
“The crucial need is for the
West not to strive for the im-
possible but to maintain strategic
beachheads against the Com-
munist advance in China. From
these beachheads can go forth
the support to resistance, the
vitally necessary propaganda, and
properly trained agents of demo-
cracy to put limits on the flood
of totalitarianism while the still
new and few forces of Asian
democracy are spiritually and
economically strengthened.”
The impossibility of changing
China overnight is also the
theme of comment by a Nanking
correspondent of N. Y. “Times,”
pointing out that the difficulties
that would face the Communists
in a general take-over would be
enormous. Listing food, general
importing and other difficulties,
with a probable setting of con-
tinued fighting, the correspon-
dent states; “The magnitude of
these problems has led some
observers to conclude that the
Communists will not try to
gobble up all China ht one gulp,
even if they can.”
The notion that the Chinese
Corns are different from others
of the breed —it has been assidu-
ously cultivated in Australian
cable and other columns —is at
last being severely attacked in
the American press (which, in-
cidentally, has gone so far as to
state that the dismal U.S. show-
ing in China stems directly from
Secretary of State Marshall’s
personal dislike for Chiang Kai-
shek). An acute student of
Marxist policies, Max Eastman,
has accused U.S. Government
leaders of “swallowing the
transparent hoax that the
Chinese Reds are middle-of-the-
road agrarian liberals.” He
added: “The [U.S.] Govern-
ment’s whole Far Eastern
foreign policy for three years
has been based on that Moscow-
manufactured hoax.”
Supporting Eastman in N. Y.
“Times,” Hanson W. Baldwin
comments that that myth should
by now have been disproved to
the satisfaction of all by events:
“Yet myths die hard, and there
are still many—rightly outraged
by the corruption, inefficiency
and autocracy of the Chiang
Government —who cling to the
comforting illusion that the
Chinese Communists are not
really Communists and that they
offer something much better
than the Nationalist Govern-
ment.
“This same mistake has facili-
tated the Communist domina-
tion of nearly every country over
which the Red tide has swept
since the war. Prior to the
Czechoslovak coup the world
was told that the Czechoslovak
Communists were ‘different’
(they, too, were ‘agrarian re-
formers’) ; they were supposed
to be Czechoslovaks first and
Communists second, Masaryk
paid for this mistake with his
life; Czechoslovakia with its
freedom.”
Only the credulous, Baldwin
concludes, continue to label the
Chinese variety “agrarian re-
formers,” and if the U.S. is now
to formulate and carry out any
China policy worth the name, it
must rid itself of that dangerous
delusion. China’s Corns are, in
fact, as they themselves have
insistently proclaimed, part of
the “world revolutionary front,
headed by the Soviet Union.”
Crime Increase.
Some extraordinary figures
given by the Archbishop of
York, directing attention in the
House of Lords to the increase
of crime in England and Wales:
In 1938 there were 78,000
convictions for indictable
offences; in 1947 the number
was 115,000, an increase of 47
per cent. In the nine years the
increases had been: Larceny, 36
per cent.; breaking and stealing,
88 per cent.; receiving stolen
goods, 141 per cent.; sexual
offences, 46 per cent,; violence,
58 per cent.
Of the total number found
guilty of larceny in 1947, 29
per cent, were boys and girls
under 17, and 12 per cent., in
addition, between 17 and 21. Of
every 100 persons found guilty
of breaking and stealing, 52
were under the age of 17, and
16 between the ages of 17 and
21. Compared with 1938, the
increase of offences by those
under the age of 21 was some-
thing like 69 per cent.
Commenting that the figures
“showed a position of very great
gravity,” the Archbishop said
they really meant that the “old
homely virtues of honesty and
truthfulness were vanishing.”
Among other remedies, he sug-
gested very great care in the
selection of magistrates, many of
whom, he said, failed to under-
stand the psychology of the
child offender. Some magistrates
overestimated the value of a
good talking to ; he had regret-
fully come to the conclusion
that the magistrate who had no
heart and a hard head would
probably do less harm than the
magistrate who had a soft heart
and a soft head.
It was stated by another
speaker that one of the troubles
to be contended with was the
lack of respect felt by children
for the juvenile courts: “There
was an idea that every child so
dealt with was entitled to his
first crime much as it used to
be said that a dog was entitled
to its first bite. The mere


indiscriminate and repeated
binding over of children might
do a great deal of harm.”
Egypt v. Israel.
Though there has supposedly
been a truce between Arabs and
Jews since early in June, a Cairo
correspondent o 4 f London
“Times” reports continued fight-
ing and in Egypt a state of war
activity and feeling about which
little has been told.
Along with daily reports of
fighting, the correspondent men-
tions that street lamps are
dimmed, air-raid warnings are
not infrequent and the Egyptian
people are continually reminded
of the war: “It dominates
ordinary life. The struggle
against the Zionists is a main
topic of-conversation and chief
subject of thought and specula-
tion. To the Egyptians the
arguments for partition—Jewish
sufferings during the World
War, Jewish insecurity in
Europe, the need of the Jewish
people for a homeland —are
irrelevant. Most of the Jews
are regarded as invaders of an
Arab land, and their claim to
take and keep part of Palestine
seems as indefensible a sample
of predatory colonialism as has
ever been condemned in the
past.”
The current war, the corres-
pondent declares, “is not un-
popular ; hatred of Zionism is
too intense.” Nevertheless,
many whose sympathy is on the
Arab side hold that in not ac-
centing the Bernadette partition
plan Egypt is acting against its
own interest, since the strength
and prosperity it would derive
from a general settlement would
be its “best bulwarks against
Communism and Zionist ambi-
tions.”
Such observers also regard the
Arab proposal for a federal
State in Palestine composed of
Jewish and Arab districts as not
only impracticable but con-
trary to Arab aims: “While par-
tition does at least circumscribe
the area of Zionist occupation,
it seems inevitable that in a
federal State, no matter what the
theoretical safeguards, the
wealthier and more resourceful
Jewish community, perhaps
assisted by political terrorism,
would quickly dominate all
Palestine.”
On the other hand, the corres-
pondent points out, with Israel
confined to the area in the
Bernadotte plan and the rest of
—“Christian Science Monitor;” Boston (U.S.A.).
HOPEFUL.
Palestine absorbed by Egypt and
Transjordan, any Israeli attempt
to expand “would not only be
a direct defiance of the United
Nations but would also auto-
matically bring into play the
treaties which bind Britain to
Egypt and Transjordan in the
event of aggression.”
The “Times” man also touches
on the importance of Egypt in
the general scheme of defences
against Soviet aggression: “So
long as Russian policy continues
to be what it shows every sign
of being, the defence of the
Middle East is vital in a world
struggle against Communism.
That defence can only be
centred in Egypt. Turkey is a
front-line country; Cyrenaica
and other areas lack many of
the essentials of a great base.
Egyptian neutrality is no longer
possible. On her may hang the
fate of the Arab States.” *
De Gaulle Policy.
It might be one thing how
General De Gaulle speaks in
seeking to regain office and quite
another how he might act if he
achieves it, but taking state-
ments he made in a press inter-
view in Paris at their face-value
his election would bring to a
head some serious, if not un-
bridgeable, differences i n
Western unity.
On U.S.-British policy, in
Germany, for instance, he said
it was no use denying that the
aim was to restore the Reich,
The announcement on the Lon-
don agreement specified German
unity as one of the objectives,
and the decision to summon one
constituent Assembly, and one
only, meant that the Reich was
virtually reborn. The Reich
could not develop in the direc-
tion of stability; it would as
ever develop the qualities of
adventurer. No doubt the British
and Americans cherished the
notion that the Reich would be-
come part of the bulwark against
Russia.
“Perhaps,” commented De
Gaulle ; “but perhaps not.”
He added that he thought it
risky to predict at this stage
which way the Reich would turn.
He recollected, however, that
Bismarck made an unbroken
understanding with Russia the
keystone of his policy and that
when Hitler decided to crush
France he had no trouble in
reaching agreement with the
Kremlin,
As interpreted by the London
“Times” correspondent, D e
Gaulle’s own solution is to have
a federal Germany, with which
France could associate within a
federated Europe without the
reservations France would feel,
if a re-formed Reich tried to
become, as it was bound to do,
the nucleus of European unity.
He further told the press inter-
viewers that the timing of the
recent U.S.-British Ruhr de-
cisions was possibly a matter of
taking advantage of the weak-
ness of France’s present regime.
Why accept, he asked, that
the French zone should be
merged in the bizone? It was
argued that such a decision
might jeopardise the Marshall
plan. No doubt. But France
had lived for centuries without
the Marshall Plan, and, while
he would not contest its im-
mense potentialities for good, it
must not lead France to sacri-
fice the future for present gains.
In further reference to the
Marshall Plan, De Gaulle
spoke of the difficulty of recon-
ciling interests and geographical
circumstances as different as
those of Great Britain and
France, and, after saying that he
saw little progress in the co-ordi-
nation of production, distribu-
— “L’Aurore,” Paris.
“IT’S GOING TO BLOOM SOON
tion and currency problems,
turned to European defence
plans. After condemning as un-
acceptable for France a system
of European defence based on
Britain, and as absurd an organ-
isation by which a French com-
mander of the land forces did
not have even the French air
force at his disposal, he declared
that as soon as France had the
regime “which suited her,” she
would no longer recognise “all
the things which people are in
such a hurry to put through.”
He then gave the outline of
the organisation which seems to
him necessary. Three theatres
of operation must be organised:
Western Europe with North
Africa, the Middle East with
East Africa, and the Far East.
France should normally have
charge of the first theatre,
Britain should be entrusted with
the second, and the United States
with the third.
He added on the subject of
European defence that “even if
one wished to exclude Spain
events would prove the attempt
absurd.”
In a leading article, the
“Times,” which has not been
overenthusiastic in liking for
De Gaulle, commented on the
foregoing: “These opinions of
a man who was once the sym-
bol of French independence, and
remains today a figure of great
influence and prestige, cannot
prudently be disregarded by
those who ask and need French
co-operation.”
Atlantic Pact.
An achievement, of sorts, is
chalked up to the Kremlin by
“Wall-street Journal’s” very
able Berlin correspondent Joseph
E. Evans: —
“The Russians are really to
bo marvelled at. In three years
they have accomplished what,
but for them, might have taken
generations, centuries might
never have happened. Thanks
to them, the idea of European
federation, which not so long
ago seemed fantasy, is now
emerging as a realisable possi-
bility.
“It is not much credit to the
vision and stature of Western
European statesmen that Russia
has had to drive them to action
which, on the face of it, is no
more than commonsense. But
more important than reasons is
the fact. The five - Power
Brussels defence agreement is
bursting its bounds, evolving into
the grander design of the Atlantic
Pact, and with it come serious
proposals for the convocation of
a Parliament of Western Europe.
In the tangled jealousies of
Europe, with its history of
hatred-born nationalisms, these
are astounding developments.”
The defensive Atlantic Pact
referred to has had a most ex-
tensive favorable press in
America since the five Western
Union nations asked Canada and
the U.S. to join them in a definite
alliance to stem the threat of
Soviet military aggression in
Western Europe. The move is
expected to come up for early
discussion in the new U.S.
Congress, and it’s sure to be ex-
ceptionally carefully looked into
there, though every further
Soviet aggressive gesture in
Berlin or elsewhere will help to
clinch it. What is looked for is
something binding enough to
prevent the U.S. standing off fbr
a year or two, as in both World
Wars, while others were being
shattered and bled white.
Satellites in Turmoil.
“Turmoil. That word alone
can summarise the news and the
condition of the satellite world.
It is the turmoil of purges, spy-
ing, terror, executions —of the
tyranny that never finds
security.”
Thus a “Christian Science
Monitor” staff-writer, who, ex-
cluding “rebellious Yugoslavia,”
shows from the news that con-
tinues to break through the
“iron curtain” that “remaking
even a little nation in the image
of Communism is desperately
hard”: —
“Even in helpless Rumania —
deep within the curtained area
and four years under Com-
munist domination —new purges
still are being pushed to blot out
resistance to Communisation.
“Throughout Eastern Europe
all the prescribed impedimenta
of Communisation have had to
be brought into play in the drive
against the institutions and the
instincts of freedom. The list of
such weapons is long—police
reorganisation, reconstruction of
the courts, treason trials, stricter
regimentation of journalists,
tighter control over the peasants,
land collectivisation, confisca-
tion of newspapers and schools
and missions, rigid control of
workers, increasing restrictions
on religious activity.
“Events in Czechoslovakia
illustrate how deeply Com-
munisation must go to wipe out
opposition. Forced-labor camps
now have been introduced pub-
licly. A law has been passed
authorising the police to arrest
and transport to forced-labor
gangs or brigades any person ac-
cused of ‘shirking’ or ‘threaten-
ing the people’s institutions.’ ”
Listing various “trials” now
going on in the different coun-
tries, the writer concludes:
“News reports telling of prose-
cutions and purges throughout
Eastern Europe are as thick as
autumn leaves fluttering to the
ground. But it is an autumn that
began long ago when Commun-
ism first grasped these countries
—an autumn that brings with it
no promise but that of a dark
and dismal winter.
“Thus there is little evidence
indeed that Communisation is
being welcomed spontaneously
by the peoples experiencing it.
There is every evidence of their
unyielding, though stifled, op-
position. This is why to
thoroughly Communise them is
a long, difficult—and perhaps
impossible—task.”
British Isolation.
The term “greatness,” a letter-
writer in London “Times
argues, could be applied to
Elizabethan England, to Eng-
land during the latter part of the
eighteenth century and to Vic-
torian Britain. “And what was
the chief characteristic of each
of these periods? It was surely
that we were so busy with our
own affairs that we had no time
to meddle in the affairs of
others,”
The “Times” having dismissed
as impossible “an equally aloof
approach to American and Rus-
sian policies,” the writer con-
cluded; “Not only is such a
policy not impossible, but it is
the only hope of our survival as
a great people and a great in-
fluence in the world. The Eng-
land of Elizabeth was great not
because of the power of its arms,
which were adequate only for its
own defence, but because it
stood aloof and integrated in a
faction-ridden world. The world
of today is in many respects
similar to the world of Eliza-
beth’s time. In place of the war
between religions we now have
a war between rival economic
and political systems. Just as
then, we shall do well for our-
selves and for the world if we
succeed merely in paddling our
own canoe.”
Dragnet Digest.
The Red Dean. —On the visit to
the U.S. of the Very Rev. Hewlett
Johnson, Dean of Canterbury, most
American commentators were as
solemn as a herd of Communists.
One exception, N. Y. “Daily News,”
headed its editorial comment on him
“Ho, Hum, He’s Here Again,” and
became happily anecdotal:, “In 1923
he spoke at a banquet where Henry
Ford was the guest of honor. John-
son first cursed automobiles ‘because
they kill so many people,’ then blessed
them because they would save numer-
ous lives by eliminating horses, which
carry horseflies, which spread disease.
Ford promptly offered him a job in
the Ford advertising department.”

from £8,500,000. Reserve union funds
sprang to £50,000,000, compared with

expenses doubled over this period,
unemployment and strikes declined to
a degree that reserves have still been
built up.

Exit Poll Prophets. Dr. George

reporting” per his poll henceforth,
“and let the newspaper reader figure
out for himself” what the poll may
convey in the way of prognostication.

Wool Scarcity. Director of the
International Wool Secretariat of
North America Morton Saveli has
stated in New York that “a world
scarcity of fine wools is developing.”
Purchasers, he said, have been buy-
ing up merino, a fine type of wool,
and production was not keeping pace
with demand. Of other grades, he
said medium and lower count wools
are fairly plentiful but there was little
sign of a general slump of high
prices.

Reluctant Lion. Already noted
here as being given ominous
emphasis in America, the charge that
Britain is hanging back on European
co-operation has been aired in Lcm-

that responsible American opinion in
London “is known to hold the view
that Britain is not helping as much
as she could, for a number of reasons,
in the work of European co-
operation ; and that British leader-.
ship has not been forthcoming in a
way that would make it plain to the
world that the prestige, efficacy and
appeal of the Organisation for Euro-
pean Economic Co-operation are of
first importance to the British Gov-

before the war. A good share of it
is in thoroughbred horses.

Truman Peace Moves. When
Truman, in the heat of the election
campaigning, proposed to send Chief
Justice Vinson to see Stalin, the move
was practically universally condemned
in the U.S. press and, apparently, by
Secretary of State Marshall and
others; so much so that Truman
bowed to the storm, admitting he’d
made a blunder. A Scripps-Howard
U.N.O.* correspondent reports from
Paris the expectation there that
Truman will probably soon revive
the idea. Also, that he will soon
make several other “audacious
world-peace moves.” A further
U.N.O. belief reported is that
Truman will take steps to organise
a defensive grand alliance linking the
United States, Canada, Britain,
France, the Benelux countries and the
British Commonwealth, and that
others will be invited to join.


BILL
By STANDBY(R.S PORTEOUS)
STEP by step, clinging grimly with
all his puny strength, the boy
fought his way up the bridge ladder.
At the top he paused, unwilling to
release his grip of the steadying rail.
Shrieking gusts of wind leaped from the
darkness ahead, half-smothering him in
their blind fury as they sought to tear
him free and hurl him backwards down
the steel ladder.
Four paces exactly and he would reach
the shelter of the wheelhouse. He knew
that just as he knew every detail of the
Noorlah’s bridge and its fittings.
DIRECTLY ahead of him was the
engine-room telegraph, a very familiar
obstacle seeing that he had to polish its
brasswork every day. Amidships was the
enclosed wheelhouse, on his right the
chartroom, and just for’ard of it, its
sharp corner jutting out in wait for the
unwary, was the flag-locker. He knew
all these things were there, knew the
exact contour of every simple detail, but
tonight he could see none of them.
Darkness, black impenetrable darkness,
surrounded and engulfed him, isolating
him from everything but the solid com-
forting rail to which he clung so tightly.
Not a hushed, oppressive darkness such
as a prisoner in an underground cell
might feel, but a darkness of movement,
violent, vindictive and with no sense of
rhythm; a roaring, clamorous darkness
filled with the thunder of unseen waves,
of shrieking wind and the clattering hiss
of hard-driven rain streaming across the
open bridge
It terrified the boy, not only by its
ruthless fury, but by its very density,
cutting him off as it did from all com-
forting companionship, unless that
friendly steadying rail could be classed
as a companion. Somewhere on the
bridge were the men of the twelve-tq-
four watch as well as Joe Pearce, his
own watchmate, who had preceded him
up the ladder. The mate would be there,
too, and, on a night such as this, possibly
Captain Bell. But for all the boy could
see of them the entire watch on deck
might have been swept over the side.
Terrifying as it was there was one com-
forting thing about the darkness. It hid
his fear from his shipmates. It was bad
enough, he felt, for a seaman with nearly
twelve months’ seagoing experience to be
afraid. For his shipmates to see his fear
would be a hundred times worse, some-
thing he would never live down.
ALONG jagged streak of lightning
flashed down, striking into the sea with
a crash as stunning and earsplitting as
a mine exploding alongside. It lit up
every corner of the bridge with the fierce
white glow of a gigantic arc light. It
lit up the bulky figure of Captain Bell,
clad in oilskins and sou’wester, clinging
to the dodger and, alongside him, the
first and second mates.. It lit up the brass
stand of the telegraph, the huddled
figures of two seamen clinging to the flag-
locker, and every rivet and rust stain in
the deck-beams overhead. It lit up the
small figure and scared white face of the
boy at the head of the ladder. It re-
vealed, just for one fleeting second, a
grey waste of confused and tumbling sea.
And in that second the boy released
his hold and shot forward. He brought
up with considerable force against one
of the seamen. Above the clamor of
the night he heard the voice of Joe
Pearce cursing him for his clumsiness.
He said, raising his young voice to a
shrill yell in an effort to make himself
heard:
“I’m sorry, Joe. I didn’t mean t’
bump y’.”
HE could see the two men now as
vague, shadowy blurs against a
faintly luminous glow of phosphorescence
as a huge comber broke aboard. He
caught a murmur of their voices as Joe
relieved the watch, detached words drift-
ing past him, floating downwind as bat-
tered gulls driven before a gale. Joe’s
voice was more distinct now as he thrust
his head close and yelled:
“Righto, Willie. Into the wheelhouse.
Watch for the next flash and make a
header for it.”
The flash came, not so bright this time,
and man and boy dived together. It
was quieter in the wheelhouse, protected
from those fierce gusts of wind and the
hard-driven, stinging rain and spray.
Also the faint upward glow
from this binnacle lamp made
the place a little lighter ,
"P HE man at the wheel glanced up.
A “Flamin’ near time y’ showed up,”
he growled. “It’s two minutes past.”
He spun the wheel savagely. “She’s
steerin’ all over the blasted ocean. Can’t
’old ’er nowhere near the course.”
The boy moved forward, steadying
himself against a vicious roll as he grasped
a spoke of the wheel.
“She’s goin’ sou’-east,” the helmsman
said, moving aside,
“Sou’-east,” the boy repeated. His
voice was small and scared.
“Trying t’ keep ’er ’ead-on ter the
seas,” the departing helmsman informed
Joe Pearce. “Brought ’er round at mid-
night, we did.” He steadied himself
against the bulkhead and nodded glumly
towards the boy at the wheel. “I’ll tell
y’ another thing. That kid won’t ’andle
’er. Ain’t got a hope. If ’e lets ’er get
broadside-on to one of them big ’uns
she’ll go right over and drown the lot
of us. This ’ere’s a cyclone, the real
thing. You better keep a eye on ’im.”
Joe Pearce snapped: “Get to hell outa
here and mind y’ own business.” He
waited for the man to leave before mov-
ing across to the binnacle and asking;
“Think you can manage ’er, Willie?”
THE boy gulped and nodded, unable to
trust his voice. With legs braced wide
apart against the heavy wallowing of the
ship he moved the wheel a few spokes,
frowning in concentration at the wildly
swaying, lighted compass card.
The older seaman stood for a few
moments before asking:
“How’s she goin’, kid?”
“Not bad, Joe.” The boy was gaining
confidence now that he was shut away
from the main force of the elements and
had his mind fully occupied with a
familiar job. “She’s swingin’ a lot.” His
fixed stare did not waver from the lighted
card.
The Noorlah had the reputation of
being a bad steering ship. Even in calm
weather seamen cursed her because they
found it impossible to hold her on a
straight course* Pearce, who was apt to
brag about his own seamanship, didn’t
share their viewpoint. She was difficult
until you got the hang of her, he ad-
mitted condescendingly, but she could
be held on a straight course. His own
steering proved that—his and Willie’s.
Willie was his pupil, and Pearce took full
credit for the way the boy had improved
from a raw lad who couldn’t even read
a compass to the second-best helmsman
on board. Able-seaman Joe Pearce, of
course, being the best. The kid was
handling her well now, not fighting her
with the wheel as the previous man had
been doing, but just giving her the right
amount of helm, meeting the swing at
just the right second and holding her to
within eight degrees on either side of
her course. And for the Noorlah in this
weather that was good steering.
“You’re doing all right, Willie,” Pearce
said with almost grudging admiration.
THE boy’s eyes flickered upwards in
a fleeting look of gratitude. The ex-
pression and, in fact, the eyes them-
selves reminded Pearce of a spaniel he’d
once owned. The dog had eyes just like
this kid’s—soft, expressive brown eyes
that shone with gratitude for an occa-
sional pat Funny that he’d never noticed
the resemblance before. But, come to
think of it, he hadn’t often patted the
dog. Nor had he ever spoken a word
of praise to the kid before, for that
matter. He’d cursed him for his use-
lessness when Willie had first been put
in his watch to replace a sick seaman,
but he’d never told him that his steering
was improving. He hadn’t thought of
it, and, even if he had, an A.B. didn’t
go about praising the latest joined ship’s
boy. That sort of thing only gave kids
swelled heads. Still, this one was doing
a mighty fine job tonight. A credit to
his teacher, he was. In all his twenty-
five years at sea Pearce had never ex-
perienced a night as bad as this. Cer-,
tainly it was no night for an inexperienced
or careless helmsman.
Forgetting his principles about giving
ship’s boys swelled heads he added:
. “Couldn’t ’andle ’er better meself.”
Having delivered himself of this, the
greatest praise of all, Able-Seaman
Pearce lurched out of the wheelhouse,
hustled on his way as the Noorlah rolled
heavily to starb’d.
THE excessive violence of the roll
caught the boy off balance. His feet
slid from under him. But even before he
recovered he was moving the wheel, meet-
ing the swing of the ship’s head with the
helm. That movement had become almost
instinctive, something he did without any
conscious thought. Not that he ever
allowed his mind to wander from the job
that was, for him, the most absorbingly
thrilling event of his short seagoing
career, of his entire, young life.
Each time he relieved the wheel he
could recapture the thrjll of that first
morning when Pearce had slipped out of
the wheelhouse for an early cup of tea,
leaving him alone at the wheel. Over-
riding the feeling of terror lest he should
do the wrong thing was the immense pride
and joy that he, William Darnell, was
controlling the course of this mighty ship,
this massive and beautiful creation of
steel. Down in the engine-room firemen
and engineers sweated to keep her throb-
bing engines turning, driving her swiftly
across the ocean. But he, and he alone,
was guiding her along her appointed
• course.
Actually the Noorlah was only a small
coal-burning tramp of 950 tons gross
register and a top speed of eight knots.
She was old and she was extremely ugly.
And tonight she was fighting for her
very life. Rolling, wallowing, groaning
and creaking, with her ancient engines
going “full ahead” she wasn’t even hold-
ing her own against the fury of the
cyclone. In Captain Bell’s opinion she
was making sternway.
Her bows soared upwards, poised for
an agonising moment, and came down
with a crash that jarred her from stem
to stern. It was as if she had slammed
into a solid rock wall. Undoubtedly the
sea was getting worse, and the boy was
finding it increasingly difficult to keep
the ship on her> course.
MR. WILDING, the first-mate, lurched
into the wheelhouse. A big broad-
shouldered man, looming bulkier than
ever in streaming oilskins and sou’-
wester, he steadied himself against the
door and studied the tense face of the
helmsman. He could see little else—just
that strained white face lit by the faint
upward glow from the binnacle and
occasionally, when the boy spun the
wheel, a pair of hands as they guided the
wheel-spokes through the lower rim of
the arc of light.
Although the boy had been in his
watch for several months Mr, Wilding
had never really studied him before. Had
he been asked to describe Willie he would
probably have said, “Just a snub-nosed
little runt of a kid. Too damned weedy
to ever make a seaman.”
But tonight the lad looked somehow
different. It may have been a trick of
the lighting or it may have been the
tenseness of extreme concentration, but
there was a certain strength, a hint of
approaching manhood in the face. Cer-
tainly the kid was steering like a man,
better than some with ten times his ex-
perience.
Mr. Wilding remembered the day Willie
had joined the ship. He’d taken one dis-
gusted look at the obviously under-
nourished boy and then ordered the bosun
to get him turned-to on the brasswork.
The kid took a long time over the job,
but he polished the binnacle and the
engine-room telegraph as they had never
been polished before, so that they
gleamed and twinkled as with some inner
light. Mr. Wilding noted that as soon
as he came on the bridge, but he said
nothing. It was not his habit to toss
praise around. He did, however, say
something when the boy faithfully carried
out his orders to clean the bridge windows
after the Noorlah put to sea. Struggling
against seasickness the boy cleaned and
polished. The result was so perfect that
the glass didn’t look like glass at all and
Mr. Wilding, about to thrust his head
through an apparently open window,
staggered backwards and cursed the kid
fluently.
Had Able-Seaman Pearce been present
the hurt expression in Willie’s eyes would
have reminded him of the time he kicked
his spaniel in a fit of bad temper. But
Mr. Wilding, who knew nothing of dogs,
and whose head felt as if someone had hit
it with a chipping hammer, finished his
outburst with a roar of “Get to hell out
of here, blast you!”
Willie shot down the ladder, leaving his
cleaning-rags and polish strewn about the
bridge. And Mr. Wilding, who really
hadn’t meant to be hard on the boy,
picked them up and put them in the
locker.
TONIGHT Mr. Wilding had come into
the wheelhouse for two reasons ; he
wanted to check the steering and he
wanted a few minutes’ respite from the
buffeting of the gale. Timing his move
to coincide with one of the Noorlah’s
less violent rolls he stepped over to the
binnacle, water cascading from his sou’-
wester as he bent to look at the compass.
“How’re you making out, son?” he
asked.
Without raising his eyes the boy said:
“I can manage ’er, sir. She’s slow cornin’
back sometimes.”
Mr. Wilding was well aware that she
was slow coming back. It was a wonder
to him that she answered her helm at
all in these conditions. For several
minutes he watched the compass-card.
And then he did an unusual thing. He
put a big wet hand on the boy’s shoulder
and said:
“You’re doing fine, Bill; fine. Keep
it up.”
This time the boy did look up, just a
fleeting glance, but it expressed his thanks
better than any words he could have used.
The expression surprised Mr. Wilding.
He coughed to cover his embarrassment
and lunged out into the gale.
The boy had no time to savor the full
pleasure of the mate’s compliment now.
He could do that when he came off watch.
At present the steering demanded every
moment of his attention. But the mate
had said he was doing fine! And he’d
called him “Bill.”
SECRETLY the boy had two ambi-
tions —to become an able-seaman and
to be addressed as “Bill” by his shipmates.
He felt, somehow, that the two would
come together. The more ‘manly form
of address would come as an acknow-
ledgment of him as a seaman, a man
among men. But so far, with the ex-
ception of Pearce’s lessons in steering,
no one had bothered to teach him any-
thing of seamanship, and the men cer-
tainly gave no indication that they were
ever likely to regard him as one of them-
selves. At best they treated him with the
same half-hearted tolerance they showed
to the ship’s cat.
Ever since he had joined the ship he’d
been called Willie. Bill was a name sug-
gestive of robust manhood, and unfor-
tunately he was anything but robust be-
sides being a long way short of manhood.
Even Captain Bell, on the rare occasions
when he spoke to him, addressed him as
Willie. Usually he completely ignored
the boy’s existence, though he had once
remarked to Mr. Wilding;
“That kid’s steering a damn’ sight
better than half these old hands. They
let her wander all over the blasted ocean
and blame it on to the ship. There's
nothing wrong with the ship, mister. The
kid’s steering proves it.”
Like all masters Captain Bell was
touchy on the subject of his ship’s faults.
It, of course, never occurred to him to
tell the boy how well he was steering.
Nor did it occur to him to express his
appreciation for the way Willie pandered
to his weakness for tea. Captain Bell
liked to start his day with a cup of tea.
At sea he invariably came on to the
bridge at dawn, and it was usually any-
thing from half an hour to an hour before
the steward appeared with morning tea —
a very trying period for the watch on
deck.
How the boy worked it no one knew.
The cook snarled at him and cursed him,
but then cooks are privileged to snarl and
curse. The only point that really mattered
was that at daybreak each morning Willie
arrived on the bridge with two cups of
tea —one for Captain Bell and one for the
mate.
THE Noorlah’s bows thumped down
again and her stern skyrocketed up
and up. The racing propeller rattled the
whole ship, vibrating the deck beams and
shivering the compass-card until the
figures were just a blur in front of the
boy’s tired eyes. For the first time since
he’d learned to steer he found himself
longing for his relief. His muscles ached

WOOLLY McGIRR.
In Mr. Billy McKell’s time as Premier of
N.S.W., before his great war effort in
establishing the Sydney Turf Club was
rewarded with the Governor-Generalship,
the idea of Mr. James McGirr hastening
home from overseas to save the State
from direction by any chance substitute
for himself would have seemed ludicrous
in the extreme. For Mr. McKell would
not have left the helm in charge of Mr.
McGirr for five minutes, and now Mr.
McGirr feels the same about Mr, Evatt.
The illustration of the pass to which the
Government of the leading State has
come is impressive.
The same stroke of fate which sent Mr.
Acting-Premier Baddeley down with a
heart-attack sped through the ether and
hit Mr. McGirr, wending his leisurely
way homeward, with the force of k brick.
Dr. Bert Evatt’s young brother, the one-
time pin-up boy of the Parramatta Girls’
Reformatory, may be the N.S.W.
Premier’s Cabinet favorite, but he is also
the unrepentant and compulsorily-
retired ex-chairman of the pro-Com-
munist Australian-Russian Society; and
as an Acting-Premier was not to be en-
dured even by one so favorably disposed
as Mr. McGirr. Besides, were Sydney
public offices to be littered with a new
set of plaques commemorating a nine
days’ wonder in Mr. Clive Evatt’s Acting-
Premiership?
So much for the personal considera-
tions of one who is himself the most
incredible Premier New South Wales ever
had—and that is saying quite a mouthful.
As for the State itself, to such straits has
the McGirr Administration reduced it
that the temporary menace introduced by
Mr. Baddeley’s illness could hardly make
things worse. “Labor’s” vindictive go-
slow in industry, together with Mr. Mc-
Girr’s own shorter-week mountebankery
and reckless expenditure, have completely
disrupted industrial order and public
finance in a community which its fatuous
Premier has been describing in England
as beating the United Kingdom when
measured by the surest “index of a
country’s manufacturing progress.” He
referred to “electricity - generating
capacity,” for which night-trotting will
create a bright new demand. The electors
must surely be driven to reflect that Mr.
McGirr, as a judge of any sort of pro-
gress, speaks from a mind quite unrespon-
sive to obvious facts. That is putting the
position with an excess of charity.
Just a year ago, as N.S.W. was taking
its dive into swollen costs under his 40-
hour week Act—the Act which he hurried
through with intent to further the case for
shorter hours then being heard by the
Federal Arbitration Court—Mr. McGirr
proclaimed in a Christmas message
that his statutory direction for less
work each week was making the
State more prosperous than ever,
and that the 40-hour fraud was the
best thing any Government had ever
engineered. He has reiterated the same
bupkum since, along with the other
absurd claims that" his Government will
have fulfilled its pledge to build 90,000
houses by May, 1950, and that under its
influence more coal is being mined than
before the war. When this is how Mr.
McGirr sees things, nobody need be
astonished by his recent article in the
London “Times” on his Government’s
achievements in “the expansion of an
Australian workshop.”
That, is the phrase he uses to de-
scribe the New South Wales of our
modern tribulations, and thus he hails the
flowering of his undertaking at the 1947
elections —“a truly constructive policy
gauged with the utmost care.” The de-
velopment, he writes, “has been remark-
able and almost visionary.” With that
“almost” he is leading from weakness,
but “visionary” is right.
The achievements pay tribute to the
character and tenacity of the pioneers
The country offers the same scope today
for people with the same qualities
Maybe; but the “Labor” party’s socialisa-
tion policy forbids it. From the way Mr.
McGirr lauds the success of his decen-
tralisation “policy,” one would suppose
that the once-bloated city had slimmed
itself into a new look. “Nearly every
rural manufacturer reports that he can
easily hold his own against metropolitan
industry.” How truly rural! They are
not just innocents, be it remarked ; the
explanation is that ithe Government’s
Secondary Industry Organisation is deal-
ing out a cornucopious flow of “necessary
help and information,” and the blessing
of co-ordination does the rest.
Mr. McGirr is undismayed by the diffi-
culties his “new order” has placed in the
way of farmers. And it is not quite clear
where week-day racing and night-trotting
come in here, for he omits all mention
of the development in these occupations
among the “remarkable and almost
visionary” features of his survey. “Nearly
three times as many workers are now
employed in electrical engineering and the
manufacture of metal goods as in 1939”
only they don’t “manufacture as in 1939,”
but so much slower that they are still
trying to overtake 1939 output. The
national economy is changing fast, he
means to say, and adds that more pro-
cessing of materials must be done in Aus-
tralia than formerly. He does not refer to
importers’ orders for made-up shirts from
Britain because under the 40-hour week
Australia cannot sew shirts fast enough
or cheap enough to clothe itself.
But he swings into a new paragraph
with a sweet conjunctive sentence which
the “Times” man must have preserved
with a grin; •
It is natural that my thoughts should
turn to wool.
But they do not turn so far as to explain
how many inhabitants of this land of the
golden fleece are unable to pay the soar-
ing prices of woollen garments produced
by their own industries, throbbing with
new life as they are under the McGirr
40-hour week.
There is more of this stuff: a reference
to shortage of houses and his Govern-
ment’s “determination to overcome it as
soon as practicable,” the State’s “assured
future with the principal black-coal fields
within 100 miles of Sydney,” a “network
of railways” (all bankrupt) and “a chain
of excellent ports in a key position for
the export trade.” This last ought to be
good news for the Country party and the
alleged export trade —so good, indeed, as
to be “almost visionary.”
Come all ye Auditors-General and
bearers of cold water! The McGirr-
Chifley Joint Coal Board chairman has
just wept tears in print about the “dis-
heartening” results of 18 months’ joint-
Government management of the coal-
mines. The new industries aspiring to
enter Australia from overseas are ex-
horted to bring their own equipment with
them, even for house-building, if pos-
sible. The cost of brick houses has risen
during Mr. McGirr’s regime to over £2OO
a square—in the past 12 months alone by
14 per cent. —and is still going up. The
railways have spent in meeting higfier
running costs all their rehabilitation fund
set aside from war-time surpluses; they
vie with the maritime transport “service”
for disgraceful pillaging of freights, and
the Auditor-General says of the metropo-
litan tram-bus undertaking that its pros-
pects are “dismal.” Forty-hours and go-
slow on the job are doubling the costs of
every Government service.
These facts do not disturb Mr. Mc-
Girr’s jubilation. With “almost visionary”
self-indulgence he has worked overtime
window-shopping in Britain and totting
up the many millions’-worth of machinery
which, if erected here, might cut down
wage-costs. His overseas tour spared him
the agony of personal participation in his
colleagues’ decision to raise tram-fares
once again. He was also out of the
country when the news broke that his
Housing Commission had been rack-
renting at least one tenant of a Govern-
ment cottage at the Government village
of Villawood, where merry widows do not
abound and where footpaths, street-
lighting and plans for a sewerage system
continue to be “almost visionary.”
Alternative to Chiang.
There seems to be no doubt that the
Chiang Kai-shek Government forces are
beaten, and a large section of them in
process of surrender. The whole of the
country north of Peking, and a very large
section of it south of the old capital, is
in Communist hands. European enclaves
at Shanghai and elsewhere and the British
colony of Hong Kong are being put into
a state of defence. The Japanese, honey-
combed already with Communist agita-
tors, are beginning to demand that their
new Constitution be abdicated almost be-
fore the ink is dry on it, to remove the
provision which robs them of the means
of self-defence —this as an alternative to
further United States aid to the Nanking
Government.
The U.S. State Department has made it
clear that it is not ready to grant China
any help beyond that voted by Congress
last year—27s million dollars for eco-
nomic purposes and 125 million dollars
for military aid. Madame Chiang Kai-
shek, who has been in Washington, goes
home empty-handed, probably wondering
where all the goodwill which was so evi-
dent a year or so ago has evaporated to.
Further south, in Malaya, where three
British people had been murdered within
48 hours when this was written, evidence
was being provided of what any whites
may expect who come within the grasp
of invading Communist armies. The
terrorists who are> carrying out the atro-
cities in Malaya are Chinese, or the .in-
struments of Chinese, who have filtered
down from the north, and who form the
disruptive vanguard of the forces which
the Kremlin hopes shortly to see dominat-
ing Asia.
The history of relations with China are
not pleasant to look back upon. That
the great, unwieldy country should have
at least the moral support of the civilised
West against aggression of all sorts was
one of the cardinal features of most
foreign policies throughout the last war
and before it.
For the past 20 years there has been
one stable fact about its politics, internal
and external—that Chiang Kai-shek has
held the reins. Sometimes under full
sail and seemingly master of his own
helm, and sometimes not, he has gone
forward, holding out against Japanese
and Communist armies, and securing help
from those outside whose interests he has
not always served in return. An artist at
sail-trimming, he has nevertheless, till
now, survived.
It is strange to look back at the changes
which have taken place without destroy-
ing him. He began with Communist
alliances and under Communist tutelage
and with the thorough goodwill of even
the “Left” trade-union movement in Aus-
tralia ; goodwill which found an outlet
in the fact that in 1928-29 the All-Aus-
tralian Trade-union congrass was rallied
to the “Hands Off China” flag by two
sterling democrats acting conjointly under
slogans straight from Moscow and Vladi-
vostok —Mr. J. S. Garden and Mr. E. J.
Holloway, now Federal Minister for
Labor and Industry. Britain at that time,
trying to hold the balance, was denounced
by Stalin and his echoes as “the most
vicious strangler of revolutions,”
Those were the days when Stalin, while
condemning the British for appeasing the
Japanese, was himself ordering his repre-
sentatives in Tokyo to bring about
rapprochement with Japan at any cost,
even if'it had to be given Manchuria
right up to Irkutsk. These concessions
he was prepared to make for the purpose
of securing a free hand to deal with
Chiang and his followers when oppor-
tunity offered.
In 1939, after two years of war,
which, according to the official Com-
munist International report, had cost the
Japanese £700,000,000 sterling, Chiang
had the goodwill of the Western world,
and especially the Leftist part of it.
Moscow later on also threw bouquets,
Chiang’s Administration lived to see
the war won, the Japanese driven out, a
feat which he himself never could have
achieved, and the Wang puppet Govern-
ment, which had been installed in his old
capital of Nanking, liquidated and re-
placed by his own. He was» given
Formosa and its resources, and the Allies
agreed that Manchuria was his.
His one mistake here was to trust the
Russians and come to an agreement with
them to act temporarily as custodians of
Manchuria at a moment when a division
of United States Marines was the only
barrier which prevented the Communist
armies of the north from moving into
Peking. Chiang since appears to have
fallen a victim to his habit of playing with
both sides, and to the disruption and
corruption which exist within his own
regime. His agreements with the Com-
munists from time to time, over the past
two years, have ended only in their secur-
ing complete possession of Manchuria
under Russian tutelage, in establishing
the Soviet Union at Dairen, in facilitating
the Red-anting of his own area, and in
weakening the support of Western
countries ; though it must be admitted
that the United States was very largely
to blame for producing the present con-
dition of affairs through its efforts, in
1946-7 to bring Communists and Nanking
elements together.
This union, of course, was quite im-
possible. Despite the innocent belief of
diplomats such as Mr. MacMahon Ball
and also of some members of the U.S.
State Department that the Chinese Com-
munists are not Communists at all but
merely ardent agrarian socialist patriots,
there is no doubt that the whole Chinese
Communist movement is part of the Com-
intern plan. It was organised from Mos-
cow, and it is designed to further the
world revolution.
In the “Saturday Evening Post” in
1946, Martin Sommers, who had been in
the thick of Manchurian politics since
1931, and who favored the American
policy of intervention to bring the
Chinese warring sections together, wrote:
The Communists, after all, are not only
Marxists but Leninists and Stalinists as
well. They subscribe to Lenin’s pronounce-
ment: “All the events of world politics are
inevitably concentrated around one central
point, namely, the struggle of the world
bourgeoisie against the Soviet Russian Re-
public.”
He might have gone further. The
report of the Comintern delegate to the
Russian Communist-party conference of
1939 —Mr. Manuilsky, who now fre-
quently figures as the “Ukrainian” repre-
sentative at U.N.O. conferences —gives
the proof that the nucleus of the present
Chinese Communist party was directly
sponsored by the U.S.S.R. and the Com-
intern. On page 31 of the report —issued
by the “Foreign Languages Publishing
House, Moscow” —it is written:
There are tens of thousands of Com-
munists working devotedly in enforced
secrecy who are not covered by any statis-
tics. The Communists of China, who left
the Soviet district of Kiangsi in 1935,
marched a distance of 12,000 kilometres
with the Red Army and performed -exten-
sive political work atnong the masses on
the way. The nuclei they set up are alive,
functioning and active, although they are
not registered anywhere.
The crucial point about the Chiang
Kai-shek regime is that, whatever its
vacillation, however Oriental its methods,
and however little its armies have at
times lived up to their purposes, it has
still played an enormous part in world
politics, and a part for which Western
countries are bound to show practical
gratitude. If Chiang had surrendered to
the Japanese at any time between 1937
and 1941 the odds in favor of a Ger-
man and Japanese victory would have
been greatly increased. If he had given
in after the Burma Road was closed the
cost fo the Allies would have been dis-
astrous. But he held out, as he was still
holding out to the last at the end of last
week. And whatever his faults, his fall
must mean the control of China by the
Communists and by Russia. This, in turn,
must raise the prosperity of all Asia, in-
cluding India and Burma, coming into*
the Soviet zone, and the fate which will
befall an unarmed Japan under the
shadow of such neighbors and the uses
to which Japanese industrial genius are
likely to be applied if the Japanese also
Communist need not be described.
Safe in Dediman's Hands.
Any Australian caught worrying about
the internal security of the nation in the
event of another war is hereby advised to
forget it and go fishing or something.
Mr. Dednian, the Minister for Defence,
has the thing sewn up. “Measures to
protect Australia’s internal security from
alien or subversive action and from civil
disturbances in war-time will be planned
by a group of committees now being set
up”—by his Department.
There will be five (5) sub-committees
to revise the National War Book, what-
ever that may be, and “national war-
time planning.” What’s more, they’ll be
linked by a standing committee of senior
members of all Commonwealth and State
Departments, and, the chairman of this
inter-departmental committee will be an
official of the Defence Department, who
will have power to co-opt members of
special committees.
Thus, if Cambodia should declare war
and make threatening gestures in our
direction it would appear that a senior
agrostologist from the N.S.W. Depart-
ment of Agriculture might at once con-
fer with his opposite number in the
Registrar-General’s office of Tasmania to
ascertain what Cambodians, if any, are
importing carroway cuttings, and, if so,
why. Their findings would perhaps be
submitted to the fourth sub-committee of
revision of the National War Book, which
will confer with the executive of the
Seamen’s Union, The standing com-
mittee could then link this with a senior
member of the Victorian Health Depart-
ment, who might call a conference of his
officers and invite the chairman of the
inter-departmental committee to co-opt
the Chief Inspector of Weights and
Measures in South Australia as a special
committee.
After which anybody who failed to
vote in the Sydney municipal elections
of 1948 might be required to register as
an alien, join the N.E.S. or pay a fine of
£2. It will be necessary, of course, to
maintain a supply of conference-rooms
and to obtain the consent of the Hotel,
Restaurant and Caterers’ Union to the
provision of morning tea at such con-
ferences —wind, weather and other cir-
cumstances permitting. All nonsense,
this; but it’s no sillier than trying to
maintain internal security, suppression of
fifth-columns and civil disturbances
with committees of Government chaps
who, by their very training, daren’t make
a move even to suppress a saffron thistle
without having a conference about it and
subsequently getting the Minister’s con-
sent. , '
On the other hand, of course, it is
typical of the mind of a Socialist Minis-
ter and of the bureaucratic conception
that nothing can be done without com-
mittees, more committees and still more
committees, all with power to co-opt and
all responsible to nobody in particular.
If it comes off Cambodia should have no
trouble in adding Australia to its pos-
sessions, though whether it would be
willing to take all the Dedman commit-
tees as well is another matter. As far
as that goes, Cambodia can have them
now without fighting about it.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Chifley, Pensions and Plums.
In the course of defending his three-quid-
a-week-gets-you-eight Pensions Bill, the
Prime Minister said some strange things,
some, too, which cut right across tradi-
tional “Labor” policy. There can be
no quarrelling with his remark that
“many men without any money sense had
given magnificent service to Parliament,”
although it invites the comment, also un-
doubtedly true, that many men without
money sense have done tremendous dis-
service to this country through a stubborn
belief that they possessed that attribute.
It is also a fact that many men who have
given magnificent service to Parliament
did so without any payment for doing it,
let alone a pension after they had retired;
but that is by the way.
Mr. Chifley went on to say that
it was not hard to make money if a man
made up his mind. The fellow who was
anxious to get money could always do so.
Coming from the leader of the Federal
“Labor” party, this is an extraordinary
statement. “Labor’s” whole policy is
based on the belief that the average man
finds money hard to make and harder still
to keep ; that the bulk of the wealth is in
the hands of a few “exploiters,” and that
it is the party’s mission to take it away
from them and give it in the form of
“social services” to. the “exploited” many.
The Prime Minister himself went on
record only three months ago in support
of this policy. He said:
Part of our motive has been to take
from those who can well afford it some
of their income and distribute it to those
who do the hard and arduous work of the
country—the people who really make the
wheels go round.
That was said last September when Mr,
Chifley was winding up the Budget de-
bate. Apparently something has hap-
pened since then to change the modern
Robin Hood’s belief in his destiny. His
function now is not to look after those
who do the “hard and arduous work,”
but to care for those who “have no
money sense.” If money is not hard to
make, then the justification hitherto ad-
vanced for the whole fabric of social
services collapses, for there can be no
doubt that the vast majority of Mr.
Chifley’s fellow-citizens are “anxious to
get money.” The ever-expanding sales of
lottery-tickets should be sufficient proof
of that.
If the Chifley contention —the latest
one—is right, “Labor’s” best, if not its
only, line of election propaganda is gone
for good. The hundreds of thousands of
workers who were on the dole during the
depression, without mention of whom no
“Labor” election speech is complete—•
weren’t they “anxious to get money”?
According to Mr. Chifley they should not
have found it hard. Perhaps they couldn’t
make up their minds.
Philosophising further, the Prime
Minister remarked:-
There is such a thing as dignity, and there
are men who have served in Parliament for
many years, and would not care to go back
to their old jobs or go around seeking a
new one.
Eight of Mr. Chifley’s party pals lost
their seats at the 1946 election, including
G. W. Martens, whose dignity was hurt
not by the electors of Herbert but by
the “Labor” pre-selection committee,
which dumped him in favor of Mr.
Edmonds. Of the eight, two “went back
to their old jobs”—Morgan, defeated by
Jack Lang in Reid, was a solicitor and
is now back in practice again ; A. E.
Smith, a oncer from Wakefield (S.A.), had
his own business and apparently returned’
to it.
The other six did not have to suffer
the indignity of going back to their old
jobs, whatever they were, nor did they
have to go around seeking new ones; the
Chifley Government found new jobs for
them. Frankie Forde (Capricornia) drew
the biggest prize—High Commissioner in
Canada ; “Stand-up” Bryson, defeated by
Mrs. Blackburn in Bourke, was taken on
by Army Minister Chambers as private
secretary; Martens was accommodated
with a seat on the board of Common-
wealth Oil Refineries, replacing the old
ex-Minister Fenton. Mountjoy, who had
accidentally represented Swan for a term,
was given an executive post with the
C.5.1.R., his sentiments and associations
being considered no disqualification for
the job.
Former Repatriation Minister Frost,
beaten in Franklin by young Falkinder,
found himself translated to where
the spicy breezes waft sweet o’er
Ceylon’s isle and installed there as Trade
Commissioner. Mr. Breen, shaking the
dust of Calare, a little unwillingly, from
his feet, turned round three times and
woke up in Cairo —also as Trade Com-
missioner. Like greater men before him,
Breen found the Egyptian climate not
altogether to his liking, so back he came
to Sydney and another job on the public
payroll—as private secretary to Mr.
Ward, He may still be there. Then,
again, he may not —Eddie’s office seems
often to have been a stepping-stone to
other and generally, though not always,
higher things. Greyhounds are barking
that Breen is hot favorite for pre-selection
for the Watson seat, for which Maxie
Falstein has lost “Labor” endorsement.
It is possible that all six gentlemen re-
jected by the electors, but not by the
Government, possess qualifications which
emipently fit them for the various jobs
assigned to them; it is also possible that
their main qualification was that they had
lost their seats and what went with them.
If the latter, then, although the Prime
Minister did not use it, there is in their
appointments a strong argument for the
Pensions Bill. If the taxpayers have to
provide for the future of defeated poli-
ticians anyway, iit is probably a better
proposition to pay them £8 a week for
doing nothing than to pay them a higher
sum for doing a job that someone else
could do better.
McKenna in Dutch.
Senator McKenna has been having a
tough spin. During the past fortnight he
has fallen foul of the A.C.T.U., the Aus-
tralian Natives’ Association and the
A.W.U.; and the Victorian friendly
societies are showing themselves more
than a little suspicious of him.
For some time it has been known that
the Minister privately acknowledges the
force of the B.M.A.’s arguments in resist-
ance to the “free”-medicine scheme, and
“THERE’S ROOM FOR HIM HERE ANY TIME YOU LIKE,
YOUR HIGHNESS”
has been searching for a formula which
would satisfy the doctors without too
obviously dishing a Caucus decision. The
new “free”-medical legislation (or partly-
“free,” or whatever it is to be), which
authorises negotiations to bring doctoring
also under Canberra’s departmental
control, has got off to no better a start
than “free” medicine (which was to look
after chemists’ bills within a “formulary”)
did; and this baffled Minister knows, if
his colleagues do not, that there can be no
prospects of success with either so long as
the Socialists persist in trying to coerce
the medical profession.
In vain do the wilder men in Cabinet
inveigh against press representations of
popular dislike or apathy as malicious
propaganda for party ends. The chief
president of the A.N.A. in Victoria--a
body whose good opinion any political
party is careful to cultivate, especially
with elections in the offing—-slatted the
Chifley legislation without reserve at the
Dandenong branch’s golden-jubilee cele-
brations earlier this month:
Experience forces the conclusion (he said)
that the free-medicine and national medical
schemes are kite-flying to gain popular sup-
port for their sponsors at the next Federal
elections rather than real efforts of some
value to the community.
After declaring that the history of Gov-
ernment social services was anything but
happy, that “free” medicine had been
found impracticable, and that the Minister
himself admitted the national medical
scheme would not be established in less
than a quarter of a century, the A.N.A.
president went on:
Commonsense suggests that the factors
essential to successful operation of such
measures should be thoroughly explored
before legislation is introduced. Other-
wise it would appear that the Government
is not very serious in its intentions and
that the whole thing is nothing more than
window-dressing.
The A.N.A. president said the friendly
societies need not be alarmed —however
natural their anxiety about the Govern-
ment’s intentions —because a winding-up
of their activities, if that were attempted,
would only add to the Government’s
embarrassments. Nevertheless the friendly
societies sent a deputation to Mr. Mc-
Kenna a few days later to ask for an
assurance on this point. Having got it,
the deputation inquired as to how the
Government scheme would operate, to
which the Minister said he did not yet
know.
Parliament was hurried into recess be-
fore these Ministerial intimations of
Socialist fallibility became known to
Caucus. Meanwhile more trouble de-
veloped on the A.C.T.U. front. Mr.
Chifley has never really forgiven the
executive of that body for reneging last*
year on its acceptance, at Mr. Chifley’s
industrial conference, of the principle of
incentive-payments as a stimulus to man-
hour production. The A.C.T.U. delegates
could not induce union leaders to endorse
the agreement when they returned home,
and Messrs. Monk and Clarey thereupon
dropped it. Mr. McKenna, as Acting
Attorney-General, was commissioned
by Mr. Chifley the other day to
press the matter again when he took to
the A.C.T.U. draft provisions of an
amending Arbitration Bill for conduct-
ing union elections (no mention of other
matters) by secret ballot. The response
on both heads was entirely frigid.
Premier Hollway of Victoria n\ust have
smiled ; Mr. McKenna certainly didn’t.
Misfortunes, ’tis said, fall on a man
in threes, and, politically, with compound
effect. A few days later A.W.U. spokes-
men vehemently attacked the unhappy
McKenna at the Canberra Trades
and Labor Council as the Minister re-
sponsible for Cabinet’s decision to abolish
the Canberra Industrial Board, which
controls wages and conditions in the
Capital Territory. The board must be
well-regarded by the A-.W.U., one of
whose spokesmen (Mr. Gardiner) called
Senator McKenna “an alleged working-
class Minister,” and urged a special levy
“to fight him on his own dunghill in
Tasmania at the elections.” Melbourne
“Age” quoted him as declaring that:
McKenna’s recommendation to Cabinet
was the most treacherous and contemptuous
action ever thrown at the Labor Council;
and the alleged industrialists, Catwell,
Holloway and Drakeford, would have to
justify Cabinet’s decision.
Another A.W.U. member (Mr. O’Neill)
called Mr. McKenna “tactless, blunder-
ing, vindictive,” and the council decided to
convey its feelings in a deputation to hifn.
Mr. Chifley’s'white-haired boy seems to
have had a disastrous fortnight. Strange
how even the Socialists don’t like totali-
tarian authority when asserted over them-
selves.
Fixed—and How!
When Queensland Premier Hanlon re-
fused to have any part of the Joint Coal
Board —the Commonwealth-N.S.W. coal-
control show which is more frequently
out of joint—a “compromise” was
reached when he agreed to set up his own
Coal Reference Board. Mr. Hanlon
made F. E. Walsh, Queensland Under-
secretary for Labor and Industry and
chairman of the State’s Conciliation
Board for the Coalmining Industry, chair-
man of the C.R.B. Not long afterwards
a “dispute” began at the Burgowan coal-
mines over some timbering issue. The
C.R.B. considered the matter and, on
the chairman’s casting vote, ordered the
miners back. They disobeye4 the order
and were sacked.
Burgowan was still on strike about a
month later, and one morning Mr. Walsh
found in his mail a,letter from Senator
(“Fixer”) Ashley informing him that he
was “retired” and was succeeded by Mr.
J. A. Murray, S.M. Mr. Murray’s first
act was to convene the C.R.8., examine
the Burgowan bother, with some other in-
cidentals, and come to no decision.
A lot of people were puzzling their
heads about it until a “Courier-Mail”
man got hold of Comrade T. Millar,
president of the Queensland Colliery
Employees’ Union. There was nothing
reticent about Comrade Millar:
in Sydney last week he had discussed
with Senator Ashley Mr. Walsh’s pending
retirement.
“We pointed out to Senator Ashley that
Mr. Walsh’s retirement was very close, and
suggested that on his retirement another
chairman be appointed.
“I want it to be made quite clear that no
decision reached by the board on the Bur-
gowan dispute influenced this suggestion.
“We had nothing to do with the actual
appointment made.”
Time marched along, and Christmas
came closer. Eight weeks after the
“trouble” began Burgowan had lost
nearly 16,500 tons of coal and the miners
about £13,500 in wages. Meantime Mr.
Murray had decided on the timber issue,
but the owners now refused to reopen
the mine, Mr. Murray’s decision being
the opposite of Mr, Walsh’s. Queens-
land Coal Owners’ Association said it
would appeal to the High Court on the
question of Mr. Murray’s jurisdiction to
handle the dispute; Comrade Millar’s
Colliery Employees’ Union threatened a
general mine strike in Queensland if
settlement was not reached by January
12, 1949.
A reporter discovered that some of
the strikers had gone to other jobs, and
a stood-down engineer told him:
We have been living on our life savings.
The stores have refused credit to several
of the men and it is going to be a black
Christmas for them.
Comrade Millar announced that the union
had issued three pays of £2 10s. to single
men and £4 12s. 6d., plus 10s. for each
child, to married men, that more was to
be paid, and he was “negotiating” for
them to go on Federal unemployment-
relief, because “they were not on strike.”
He added that a Federal “move” was
expected, and the matter was now in the
hands of the Commonwealth Coal
Tribunal (Mr. Gallagher) and the Acting
Attorney-General (Sen. McKenna).
When he was “retired” Mr. Walsh
mildly said the change in appointment
was a surprise to him. The change and
the subsequent doings are no surprise to
those who know the “Fixer” way and
the way the “Fixer’s” crowd jump to it
when a Communist union boss wags a
menacing finger.
"Single in Purpose."
There is a class of Australian whose
devil-may-care attitude towards life is
bad enough normally; at this season of
the year it becomes most pronounced.
Obsessed by the imminence of Christmas
festivities —legitimate enough in their way
but surely not the orbit of all thought—-
and firmly believing in the giving and
receiving (especially the receiving) of
gifts, this class goes heedlessly in pursuit
of pleasure in total disregard of the poli-
tical, international and national portents
of the times.
The number of these regrettable people
is so great and their influence in
the community so important as to
make it impossible to ignore them.
Yet it would be hopeless, for in-
stance, to impel them to weigh the posi-
tion in China, the failure of U.N.0., the
sinister developments in Indonesia and
Malaya, of the situation of their own
underpopulated and poorly-defended
country in a world whose hopes of con-
tinuing peace are, at least, nebulous.
To expect this class to pay some atten-
tion to Dr. Evatt, their Foreign Minister,
when he blames the failure of U.N.O. on
to the “Big Powers,” is hopeless. They
refuse to heed either the warnings or the
implications of the British Socialist de-
cision to set-up Government pubs ; their
sense of morality is not outraged by the
prevalence of legalised and illegal
gambling in Australia ; the chronic short-
age of coal and its concomitant effects
on industry, the 40-hour-Week tragedy,
the rising cost of living, the slow-down
of production—all this and more neither
creases their brows nor disturbs their
sleep.
It is true that they displayed a passing
interest in the naming of the infant Prince
of Edinburgh, but even this important
event could not divert them for long from
their absorption in the tinsel pleasures
of the festive season. Their thoughts run
in purely personal, if not downright,
selfish, channels, and, as far as the imme-
diate future is concerned, the only mani-
festation they expect is the apparition of
a white-bearded old gentleman in a red
cloak. God bless the kids and their inno-
cent and happy hearts! They help to
keep us cheerful and give us something to
work for. We couldn’t do without them.

POLITICAL POINTS
It is claimed as one of the greatest
achievements of U.N.O. that the General
Assembly has unanimously approved a
convention outlawing genocide, defined
as “the mass destruction of any group” ;
Hitler’s action against the Jews being
cited as an example. The fact that such
a resolution should be thought necessary
is a shocking indictment of this co-called
enlightened age, and its acceptance is one
more example of the futility of U.N.O.
Once the resolution was brought up what
nation could possibly vote against it?
And what nation capable of such a crime
would be deterred by reluctance to break
its pledged word? Germany, the only
country against which an accusation has
been brought, is not a member of U.N.0.;
Russia, whose delegate voted for the con-
vention, would be hard put to prove that
it had not already been guilty of geno-
cide in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.
Dumped so heavily by the A.L.P.
executive that the jingle of his votches and
chains could be heard all the way from
Maroubra to the Customs House corner,
Maxie Falstein looks like being the first
to become “entitled” to the taxpayers’
bounty under the Federal members’ pen-
sions scheme. It appears that he will
have the choice of waiting till he is 45
—he turned 34 last May—for his life-
pension of £8 a week or of taking, when
the present Parliament winds up, a lump
sum which will represent approximately
1000 per cent, on his one year’s contri-
butions. He will have 12 months in
which to weigh up the pros and cons, but
it shouldn’t take him as long as that.
Take the cash, Maxie ; a lot can happen
in 10 years.
A proposal to bring out war orphans
from Europe for adoption into Aus-
tralian families is one of the best moves
Immigration Minister Calwell has made.
Kiddies selected by Australian migration-
officers in Europe will be housed tempor-
arily in a home in Sydney, and couples
wishing to adopt them will take
youngsters for a trial period before com-
pleting formal adoption. Three pur-
poses will be served —alleviation of
misery in Europe; a reduction in the
waiting-list of persons desirous of adopt-
ing children; a gain in new young Aus-
tralians.
While the House was waiting for the
Treasurer to make his Budget speech in
rushed a woman member who announced
that the Minister had bitten her cheek,
that she had knocked him out, and that
anyone interested in such sights would
find him asleep in the passage. It hap-
pened in Tokyo—not Canberra. Our
Ministers don’t bite, our women members
don’t punch, our M.Ps. do their sleeping
in the Chamber, and, besides, the Jap
Treasurer resigned.
Old in English history are the names
of principals in the bribery inquiry.
Belcher, “Labor” Secretary to the Board
of Trade, now resigned, had perhaps as
ancestor one of the heroes of the English
Ring, as such immortalised by Hazlitt
and Borrow. And if Solly Wulkman,
alias Stanley, could claim kinship with the
Stanleys, instead of having a Polish-ghetto
origin, he would be able to boast a
descent with its roots in the Norman
conquest. Ninety years ago a Stanley,
Lord Derby, was Prime Minister, and his
son was Secretary of State for the
Colonies. The ancestors of the contem-
porary “Stanley” were then doubtless in
the old-clo’ business. '
In spite of what has happened to the
existing States and the obvious deter-
mination of Federal “Labor” to concen-
trate all power in Canberra, the A.N.A.
persists in advocating abolition of the
States and the creation of provinces in
their stead, elected representatives .from
the provinces to constitute the Federal
Parliament. A far better policy, and one
more likely to appeal to the people of
north Queensland, New England and
Riverina, would be to create new States,
and, through their members in Canberra,
break down the political dominance of
Sydney and Melbourne.
With a sudden pounce the Netherlands
Government seems to have extinguished
the Jap - collaborator - Communist - cum-
opportunist coterie which calls itself the
'“Government” of the “Indonesian Re-
public.” The Netherlanders announced
that the time had come to put an end to
terrorism. As this was written it was
reported that Soekarno, Mohamed Hatta,
the Foreign Minister (Agus Salem) and
Sjahrir had been captured, along with
their capital, and that Dr. Evatt’s Great
, Unknown who has been playing the part
of Canberra’s Ambassador to the Com-
rades was “isolated.” It is only a few
days since the U.S.S.R., Australia, the
Philippines and the Indias secured ad-
mission of the now-flattened Republic to
E.C.A.F.E.
Unanswered political query which must
have occurred to every reader of the con-
spiracy-case reports: Why was Garden
allowed the run of Ward’s department
when he was in Holloway’s department?
News that the Powell-Duffryn report
on Blair Athol coalfield was very favor-
able indeed —the British experts said the
deposits were thicker and richer than any
seams, they had elsewhere examined so
close to the surface —coincided with the
announcement of the accidental dis-
covery Of a new deposit in the Callide
area. On the same day the Victorian
Government disclosed that it had also re-
tained Powell-Duffryn consultants to ad-
vise on the further development of the
Cabbage State’s brown coal, with parti-
cular emphasis'on its use for gas. N. S.
Wales miners should ponder on these facts
during their Christmas holidays.
Supporting a bill authorising State pubs
in new “satellite” towns Herbert
Morrison told the Commons it was Gov-
ernment policy to cut down drinking;
managers paid by the Government would
have no vested interest in pushing the
sales of liquor. He said to wavering
members of his party: “If you could
swallow iron and steel two weeks ago,
you can swallow this.” If Australian
socialises who are also advocates of
grabbing the. steel industry turned their
attention to nationalising the liquor trade
they would find a lot of support. Not
all of it would come from their own
party, though a lot of the opposition
would.
One of the most welcome greetings
The Bulletin has received this festive
season: a charming floral calendar from
Peter Dargin, the Portland (N.S.W.)
butcher who in 1943 defied the trade-
union bludgeon and proceeded to conduct
his business the way he wanted to. The
“co-op.” butchery established by the
Com.-driven unions to put him out of
business still finds Dargin strongly en-
trenched in Williewa-street, Portland,
five years after it set out to ruin him.
Good luck to you, Peter!
Idealism is not dead in Australia. The
Prime Minister recently spoke of the
sacrifices made by men who entered poli-
tics. The response was remarkable ; 138
candidates have already been endorsed
for “Labor” pre-selection ballots for the
40 N.S.W. seats, and there are more to
come. For the seven Senate vacancies
“Labor” has endorsed 71 starters. Among
these 200-odd patriots are many men
holding down well-paid jobs as union-
organisers, clerks and so on who are
willing to say good-bye to all that for
the honor of serving their country for no
other reward than a paltry £l5OO a year
phis expenses, plus a gold pass, plus a
few free air-trips a year,, plus the pros-
pect of an eight-quid-a-week pension
when the ungrateful electors reject them
or the A.L.P. decides, as in the case of
Falstein, that it is time for somebody
else to carry the burden of “statesman-

Estimate for the 1948 Queensland
sugar season is 6,350,000 tons of cane —a
record figure—with an expected yield of
882,000 tons of raw sugar. Crushing will
continue well on towards the end of
January. After that all that remains to
be done is to get it away from Queens-
land ports before the 1949 crop comes in.
In Melbourne the tram v. bus argu-
ment still goes on. Mr. Bejl, chairman
of the Tramways Board, said work on the
Bourke-street-Clifton-Hill line would
begin after the holidays; Mr. Kennedy,
Minister for Public Works, said it had
better wait a while; Mr. Hollway said
Cabinet would shortly discuss the matter.
And there it rests, where it has often
rested before.
With election-year about to break, anti-
“ Labor” parties in several States are still
shadow-sparring against each other in-
stead of getting down to the job of beat-
ing the Socialists in the greatest possible
number of seats. In Queensland the
Country party has knocked back sugges-
tions for a merger with the Q.P.P. and
put up a, plan for co-operation under
which it would contest nine seats, the
Q.P.P. eight; the two parties to run a
joint candidate for Herbert. On the other
side of the continent the West Australian
Liberal and the Country and Democratic
League seem similarly ‘to be unable to
reconcile their differences. The Libs, say
they intend to contest every seat; the
C.D.L. feels that some of the new seats
belong to it. Meanwhile “Labor” sits on
the sidelines and grins.
Despite all the burblings earlier in the
year about what Canberra proposed to
do to foreign countries which bought our
wool and then resold it to America for
dollars, the business goes on, A U.S.
Commerce Department bulletin says that
in September indirect imports of Aus-
tralian wool amounted to 75 p.c. of the
quantity and 83 p.c. of the value of total
U.S. imports of greasy wool for that
month. The practice certainly deprives
Australia of needed dollars, but it is
legitimate business, and Canberra may
burble itself black in the face. It would
be the height of folly to clap an export
embargo or resale restrictions on wool.
Asked to choose the 10 biggest news-
stories of 1948, Australian editors are
alleged to have weighed-in thus:
1 and 2 (tied). President Truman’s elec-
tion and the illness of King George;
3,4, 5, 6 (tied). Princess Elizabeth’s
baby, Bernadette assassination, death of
Gandhi and India’s independence, Berlin
air-lift and the “cold war” in Europe.
7,8, 9, 10 (tied). The Chinese “civil” war,
Kasenkina case, General Smuts’ defeat in
South African election, the struggle for
Palestine.
What, nothing about a doped racehorse
or a “leading dog bookmaker’s” opinion
of it?
Writing of the Palestine mess and the
proposal to admit Israel to U.N.O. while
murder and hatred and the remnants of
U.N.O.’s previous muddling litter the
landscape, “S. M. Herald” suggests that
it will “do injury to U.N.O.’s standing as
an impartial international tribunal.” But
how can you injure something that
doesn’t exist?
Chief Justice Drake-Brockman having
suggested some amendments to the Com-
monwealth Arbitration Act, the Chifley
Government has accepted one to protect
unionists against victimisation and perse-
cution by hostile union officials. This
will set every Communist in the country
howling for the Chief Justice’s scalp.
There seems little hope that the Govern-
ment will agree to another amendment
providing for appeals against findings of
the conciliation commissioners.
Pollard has announced the personnel
of his new Australian Wheat Board.
Growers who voted for the new “stabi-
lisation” scheme, whence springs this new
board, must be wondering just what the
Government nomination of an em-
ployees’ representative” means. For those
that are wondering let it be said that it
is the Socialist conception to have such
representatives. It’s a sort of a kind of
a gesture to the downtrodden wage-
plugs, and the job is a sinecure.
Only 12 Federal members attended
every one of the 56 sittings of the ses-
sion just ended. Two at any rate had a
good excuse for irregular attendance.
They were Mr, Ward and Mr. Falstein ;
the Crown required their presence else-
where.
There is one member of the Federal
Parliament of whom his constituents will
not be able to complain that he neglects
his work at Christmastide. Earle Page’s
Christmas-card is illustrated with a
relief-map opposite a bold inscription
which says: “The Future New England—
A Vision of Controlled Use of Clarence
Waters. The numbers indicate the sites
of proposed dams, weirs and water-power
developments.”
Announced by the president of the
Indian National Congress that his country
proposes to follow the example of Eire
and become an independent republic—an
ominous move at a time when some
Indian leaders are as thick as thieves with
Moscow. Mr. Justice Pal’s judgment at
the Tokyo war trials, which absolved the
Japanese from the guilt of aggression and
atrocity, was no mere expression of in-
dividual opinion. It was a specific emana-
tion of the Indian Government’s back-
ground attitude. At heart it believes that
the time is fast coming when Asia will
dominate the world.
From The Bulletin’s Oldest In-
habitant :
Going on my boyhood memory of Peter
Lalor, reinforced by Phil May’s Bullletin
sketch of him as Victorian Speaker (“Well,
b’ysl”), I agree that he would have “grinned
at the thought of a ‘Labor’ Government having
■ a Federal electorate named after him” (B.
15/12/’4B). I doubt whether Dorothea Mackellar
will be amused at the intended compliment
to her; the possibility may occur to her that
“Labor,” unlettered and racing-mad, confused
her with a filly that won the Robbery Park
Cup. , # .
Ward’s tribute to Moscow is recorded
in the Parliamentary reports—“ The
Soviet has made more progress in 25
years than any capitalist country has
made in ten times that period.”
Moscow’s tribute to Ward is still awaited
with the weird expectancy said to be
characteristic of the Australian Bush.
A conference calling itself the Inter-
national Federation of Democratic
Women met in Budapest and passed reso-
lutions calling on the United Nations to
accept the Soviet proposals on atomic
energy “as the only possible way to
curb preparations for war.” It then re-
solved to set up a commission to draft
“a women’s Bill of Rights.” It wasn’t
reported in the cables whether the pro-
posed rights would include the right of
Russian women to join their husbands in
countries outside the Iron Curtain or
the right of Mr, Calwell’s Manila girls
to earn their living where they please.
Proportional representation for the
Senate seems likely to be a cause of bad
blood between team-mates. With seven
Senators to be chosen from each State
at the next election it is generally con-
ceded that the most any party can expect
to get home is four, so both sides favor
nominating only that number of candi-
dates. The decision as to who is to be
the odd man out depends partly on the
popularity of the party and partly on
popularity within the party, the one a
factor largely beyond the control of the
individual, the other an item he can, and
will, try his damnedest to influence. In
the upshot, rivalry within the fours may
well be more bitter than the warfare
between them.
During the debate on the Federal Par-
liamentary “pension,” Chifley remarked,
“If you want to know what God thinks
about money, have a look at the people
who’ve got it.” Does he mean those
who’ve got it now or those who had it
before he became Prime Minister?


CHRISTMAS DAY IN THE 40-HOUR-WEEK WORKHOUSE.


Society
“AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS.”
* * * *
“Young Slim”: Christmas, 1944, saw
us running convoys to Morotai, and our
two-day spell in Biak was spent in pre-
paration for Christmas dinner, complete
with lend-lease turkey and fresh vege-
tables, with Aussie beer saved from the
weekly ration since October. The great
day came, and the turkey slid down with
icy cold beer. Things warmed up in the
afternoon, until the sigs were calling up
every ship in harbor to wish them Merry
Christmas. At the height of the revelry
orders came to proceed to sea —to the
dismay of the Old Man. He had a bit of
strife getting the anchor up, and I’m
sure it was he who took her through the
reef safely. At sea complications arose
when a rotund A. 8., ordered to the mast-
head, got half-way up and refused to
move one way or the other. He was still
there at midnight. Our 10-degree zigzag
became 40 degrees. Then when it seemed
that all was under control a stiff breeze
worked up and our beautiful lend-lease
turkey rebelled and deserted en masse.
* * * *
“Becks”: The bestowal on Princess
Elizabeth’s infant son of the name Prince
Charles of Edinburgh brings back to the
Royal Family a name which has been
out of favor for over 200 years. Because
of its associations with the House of
Stuart, and especially with the Young
Pretender, the name was anathema to
the Hanoverian Georges, and Victoria did
not include it in the 13 names she dis-
tributed among her four sons, although
it was one of the names of the Prince
Consort. George V gave it as a second
name to his youngest son, John, who died
in 1919. Prince Charles stands second in
succession to the Throne. He is fifth in
line of descent from Queen Victoria;
tenth from George I; thirty-second from
William the Conqueror ; and thirty-ninth
from Alfred the Great. Tracing back
to the Scottish Royal House he is four-
teenth in line from Mary, Queen of
Scots; twenty-third from Robert Bruce
(twenty-second if reckoned through the
Bowes-Lyons) and twenty-eighth from
St. Margaret of Scotland, queen of Mal-
colm Canmore, who overthrew Macbeth.

“Ray Whiting”: While taking it easy
in Palestine waiting for the trip home
another bloke and I copped a sweet job
caricaturing the officers for an “exhibi-
tion” to be held in the officers’ mess on
Christmas Day. The assistant-adjutant,
having a propensity in his fighter moments
for bunches of flowers, carried the
monicker of Ferdinand; so, naturally, I
drew him with a bull’s body—and I left
nothing out. On the morning of the
show I was aroused by the quickest
“runner” I’ve ever seen bawling “You’re
wanted in the officers’ mess at once, and
take a rubber!” At the mess I was met
by a perturbed “loot.” “For the love of
Mike rub out the adjutant’s end!” he
hissed. A matron and a covey of sisters
had arrived from the A.G.H.
* * * ♦
“B. A. Ker”: Mention of those metal-
clip eyelets on yesteryear’s boots (B.
24/11 /’4B) takes me back. Scene; A
School of Arts 25 years ago, a lodge
social in full swing. Gradually a shy,
ungainly youth has worked his self-
conscious way from''the doorway to a
seat against the back wall. “Excelsior”
has been ducted by the local butcher and
pound-keeper; the plumber has sung
“Roamin’ in the Gloamin’ ” with a Scotch
accent that hints at pidgin English, and a
young prodigy has rendered “Mr. Baggy
Breeches.” Now the concert portion has
ended and dancing has begun. The youth
is eyeing the door regretfully; he hadn’t
expected this, and he has wandered rather
far from his base. Suddenly he is
trapped! One of those “jolly” women
has discovered him. He tries to efface
himself, but there is no escape; she has
him by the arm and is dragging him out
into the barn-dance. He would love to
protest, but he is too shy. He has been
dragged to his feet. Now he is being
pushed towards the open floor. Crash!
Five-feet-ten of gangling youth is flat on
the floor —his feet locked together by
those clip-eyelets that “H.” wants
brought back. I never again sat with my
feet self-consciously rubbing together.
* * * *
“F.S.”: Melbourne National Gallery
is contemplating the production of a 15-
minute film, partly in black-and-white and
partly in color, depicting a selection of
works in the various collections. It would
be a welcome change from the generally
dreary documentaries of suburban bun-
fights and beauty contests which the film-
smiths regard as a portrait of this country.
From its collection of ceramics, sculpture,
furniture and Old-Master pictures the
“ You'd he proud of my cooking if you came back , Maggie!”
gallery could make an outstanding film.
Another way of publicising its possessions
would be to supply first-class reproduc-
tions of its paintings to the Railways
Commissioners to post up in their
carriages instead of the inevitable photos
of beauty spots, real and alleged, which
are calculated to make anybody who sees
them want to go somewhere else.
* * * *
“Dee”: Out on the Darling Downs the
proprietor of the Pittsworth “Sentinel”
recently rebuilt the front of his premises
in keeping with the growing civic con-
sciousness of the town, and on the neat
little front window he monogrammed
“P.S.” as the sign of his journal. But
he’s not so sure of the wisdom of this
gesture to progress; the town drunks
persist in mentally transposing the letters,
and he spends most of Friday and Satur-
day knocking back “sports” who want
10-bob each way on something in Bris-
bane.
# * * *
“Norther”: I don’t know what social
trend it signifies or whether it has any
effect on the battle of the sexes, but the
Queensland statistician has discovered
that in 1947-48 there were 14,895 “per-
manent full-time female workers” on the
State’s farms. And he meant farm
workers, not domestics or girls who
worked part-time in the house and helped
with the milking and so forth. No, the
14,895 are paid by the week, some with
their keep, to plough, hack, dig, pick,
bud, spray, muster, draft and perform all
the other tasks. A lot of them are prob-
ably on dairyfarms as full-time milkers
and separator-hands, but I must confess
to some curiosity about the others. You
see, apart from owners and “unpaid rela-
tives,” the male full-time farm-workers
totalled 25,500-odd, which makes the girl
toilers more than half as many. Maybe
the ladies are discovering what their oppo-
site numbers are forgetting—the joys of
a rural life,
♦ * ♦ *
“Hamer”: I go to Jim’s for my pint,
Joe’s for my boot repairs and Tom’s for
my tobacco; if I want meat, Harry’s is
the place where I get it. My female
relatives go to Daphne’s for their hair-do,
Pat’s or Lucille’s for their gowns, Ann’s
for their cakes and Edna’s for their
flowers. Into this community of friendly
call-me-by-my-first-name trades-people
has come another. When I noticed that
the place where I was buying bananas
was called “Cyril’s” I jestingly asked
“How’s Cyril?” A male voice answered,
“I am Cyril, mister, and I am welly well,
I tank you.” I turned; a full-blooded
Chinese smiled blandly at me. He re-
peated, “I am Cyril, please, sir. I am
welly well, tank you.” I don’t know any
reason why a Chinese should not be
Cyril, but I am still surprised.

“Eureka”; Just after lights-out in the
hospital ward a patient asked the nightr
nurse for a glass of water. “Does any-
one else want a glass?” asked the nurse.
Six other patients said they’d be in it.
The nurse brought in a tray with seven
glasses. An hour later she went round
in the gloom and collected the glasses,
only to find on getting out into the light
that they still contained water and also a
set of false teeth apiece. Next morning’s
job of sorting out the dentures kept the
whole ward amused.

“Matelot”: A recent Service Depart-
ment note on Boer War medals over-
looked the Trooping Medal, issued to
commanders and officers for service in
troopships. I remember my disgust when
a senior Naval officer made the presenta-
tion on board the “hired transport” in
which I was serving. I had expected to
see the decorations pinned on the coats
of the recipients; instead they were
merely handed over in the cardboard
boxes in which they had come from the
makers. Three or four medals were
allotted to each troopship which had
made a specified number of voyages. I
fancy that was the first occasion on which
the Admiralty or the Army saw fit to
recognise the part played by the mer-
chant navy in military operations,
» * * *
“Tackline S.”; Vivid road-signs (B.
24/11/ ’48)? I saw a gruesome one on
a trip from a. Venezuelan seaport to
Caracas, the capital. Lack of apprecia-
tion of road safety being renowned in
the locality, we chose a taxi-driver who
appeared to have a modicum of common-
sense in excess of that of his brethren.
We were carefully piloted through the
town until we struck the long road
forming a ledge on the mountain-sides.
Then our 20-h.p. was put to the gallop.
Rounding bends at breakneck speed with
sheer drops of hundreds of feet along-
side, heartbeats were 19 to the dozen
until the vividness of a road warning
almost reversed them to zero. Conspicu-
ously mounted on a concrete base were
the remains of a high-speed head-on
collision. It spoke wordless volumes.
* * * «
“Rough Ruby”: I agree that the ex-
associate from Hertfordshire (B.
8/12/’4B) probably felt her money was
well spent. Last week-end, with a fel-
low-associate, I reached the 10th tee to
find a veteran full-member cracking off
a sizzling 25-yard drive. His partner
must have been a classy player in his
day, as his. tee-shot went nearly twice
that distance. They had about six shots
each before they got out of range. No
apologies for cutting-in; not even a
“Good morning.”, The reason the 19th
is so exclusive is that the males are
scared we might snigger at their tales of
the round. We know; we’ve followed
them for many weary miles. “Long
Marker” may rest assured that when the
revolution comes we’ll put his name down
for a caddyship and see to it that he gets
an occasional game on Sunday after-
noons after 3.15.

“Mcß.”; At Lord Mayor Disney’s
holiday camp for country youngsters at
Portsea (Vic.) the kiddies are encouraged
to write home. A letter-card carrying no
address was returned to the camp. Camp-
leaders opened the card and read this
opening sentence: “Dear Mum, To read
this you’ll have to tear the sides.”
* * * *
“Minto”: Manners may be lacking in
the modern lad, but precocity is not. A
youngster mooched into my store and
spoke up with the Chesterfieldian charm
that characterises recent vintages of
schoolboys: “Hey, mate, I’m after that
job for a smart lad.” “I’m sorry,” I
replied. “The position is filled.” “Huh! ”
he answered, “In that case what you need
is a smart manager—to get that notice
out of the window saying you want a
lad.”
* * * *
“Pongo”; “Harold Hardupp’s” par. (B.
1/12/’4B) about the council candidate
who promised every ratepayer a decent
bath recalls a building project of over
50 years ago when a contractor with an
unpronounceable name built over 150
terrace houses in Woollahra (Sydney),
They were let long before completion,
simply because each had what was then
a great luxury—a bath. The baths were
located in The wash-houses behind the
kitchens, which also housed the built-in
fuel copper and wooden wash-tubs.
They were rough in every sense, being
built of brick cemented over. The wash-
houses had no doors, and when one
decided to bathe a curtain had to be
stretched across the entrance to block the
view of next-door neighbors. Neverthe-
less, those baths were a boon to the
tenants, and some are still functioning.
* Sfc *
“Plum”: A recent Broadley jote-block
of smoke-rings rising from a deep-sea
diver calls to mind a curious prohibition
in the S.A.A. Code for Work in Com-
pressed Air; the diver, before descending,
is required to “discard from his person
any smoking materials.” For work in
compressed-air chambers this seems rea-
sonable enough, as with the increased
oxygen supply furnished by compressed
air a cigarette would perform something
like a Roman candle, and a match would
flare like a torch, A diver, though, seems
to be effectively prevented from lighting-
up while at work. But the* ban is not
so silly as it sounds —as witness the case
of a diver who took a last puff at his
pipe before going down, and dropped the
smouldering brier in his pocket. When
the air pressure reached a point sufficient
to turn the smoulder to a blaze, he was
hauled up in some haste, burning briskly.

“J.H.M.A.” conjectures on Christmas,
1788:
There are only two places in the Common-
wealth where Christmas was kept up in the
first year of settlement —the shores of Sydney
Cove and the tiny outpost where Old Govern-
ment House stands in Parramatta Park. There
was then little that was conducive to merri-
ment and goodfellowship: the land of promise
appeared to be only a dismal failure. There
was a threat —even an experience—of famine.
There was hardly a condition of the common
existence that might have been regarded as a
factor towards ensuring the good cheer of the
festival. The very fact that Christmas was to
take place in the blaze of midsummer almost
amounted to bitter insult in the understandings
of these exiles, compulsory and voluntary alike.
Many of them would have taken more comfort
from starving in the bitter weather they re-
garded as “seasonable” than from ceasing to
be hungry and ragged with the thermometer at
over 90 degrees. They would, at least,. have
been perishing as other Christians were perish-
ing in the civilised world. As it was, they were
being imposed on, made a jest of, treated un-
naturally. Everything was wrong with the place
—even Christmas couldn’t come along in its
proper shape at the right tipie. It was a hungry,
half-starved and tattered community, and what
rejoicings there were must have been pretty
half-hearted. Everyone was on short commons.
At first a weekly ration, consisting of 71b.
biscuit, 11b. of flour, Tib. of beef (or 41b. pork),
3 pints peas, and 6oz. butter, was served out
to the soldiers and male convicts, the women
receiving one-third less; but by October a
reduction became necessary, so that the men’s
rations were reduced by 11b. of flour, and the
women’s by a proportionate amount —not until
the Justinian arrived with a large cargo of
supplies on June 20, 1790, was the full ration
‘reinstated, and the fear of famine dispelled.
About the only form of festivity which enlivened
the season was the issue of an extra allowance
of rum to soldiers, sailors and prisoners. But
rum on empty stomachs is hardly conducive
to geniality and jollity so much as to morose-
ness and ill-temper, so it may be safely assumed
that Sydney’s first Christmas was very far from
being a happy one. It is not likely that there
was a single plum-pudding cooked in N.S.W.,
and for the children there was no possible
prospect of a visit from Santa Claus. It’s more
than certain that everybody in the settlement
was heartily glad when the “festival” was over.
BORN CRAFTSMEN.
“I never had any coaching, but that is not to
say that coaching is bad.” —Don Bradman.
Poeta nascitur, non fit was noted
Long since by him who down this axiom laid
Which from the classics ever since has floated,
The solid truth you hear so often quoted:
Poets are born, not made.
Not only poets does the -proposition
Apply to. You’ll observe the stars who’ve
shone
Brightest where cricket skill’s on exhibition
Are those who stood in need of no tuition,
Like “W.G.” and Don.
They learned the game, it may be, through some
fairy
Godmother’s unrecorded cradle-wish,
In some inexplicable light and airy
Way, just as chirping comes to a canary
Or swimming to a fish.
Singers are born. Unless they’ve that mysterious
Endowment Nature—and nought else —can
bring
To vocal muscles, they’ll be never serious
Claimants to rank with Melba the imperious
Or even Crosby (Bing).
Keep it in mind, you athletes “linked to-
gether”
(As Byron wrote) “in cricket’s manly toil,”
Who ply the flashing blade and hurl the
leather.
Ponder the apothegm and tell me whether
It’s not the dinkum oil.
Coaching is sure an admirable ticket
For those who aim to reach a higher grade.
But champs whose mere appearance at the wicket
Draws surging crowds, the supermen of cricket,
Such must be born, not made.
N.S.W.
T. THE R.


“Bo”: I accept it as a matter of course
that my favorite daily-strip character is
allowed by his creator to shave with his
non-razor hand doing nothing; to crank
up a car by using a grip that will assure
him of a broken thumb should the
engine backfire ; to hold a 4in. paint-brush
the same .way as he does a fountain-pen ;
use a garbage-can which, after months
of use, has still miraculously been spared
concertinaing by the council men; take
a pair of sox out of his lowboy drawer
and pull them straight on (and he a
married man!), and take a box of
matches from the kitchen stove without
finding that the first one he tries to
strike is a used one his wife has put back.
But the last few days I’ve noticed the
character with a look of twisted pain.
I was puzzled, at first, then I remembered.
A few days before he was allotted the
task of lifting what purported to be a
heavy weight. His creator heartlessly
allowed him to bend down and pick it
up without bending his kpees. I expect
next week to see the character in a
hospital theatre being operated on for
double hernia.
“Vandemonia”: Probably an older piano
than the Henty antique (B. 24 /11 / ’4B) is
the one which belonged to Lady Frank-
lin ; it is an honored piece of period
furniture in an old stone mansion in the
Macquarie Plains district of Tasmania.
Like the Henty piano, it is tall, carved,
upright, and has the same pleated-silk
front. It is still playable, though the tone
is rather tinny.
“Dary”: “Nakh’s” mention of the
Hentys’ piano (B. 24/11/’4B) brings to
mind the fact that there is in Mittagong
(N.S.W.) a piano which is claimed to be
one of the four first brought to N.S.W.
It is not an upright, but rather like a
small oblong grand—a Broadwood, if my
memory is correct, and certainly English-
made.

“Jay Emm”: If “Never Again” be-
came sick after peanuts and beer (B.
24/11 /’4B) it must have been the
beer that was to blame. In our Axmy
canteen one of our harmless pastimes
was peanut-racing. A group drinking
together would buy a packet of salted
peanuts each, drop a nut each in a glass
of beer and bet on whose would surface
first after reaching the bottom of the
glass. Winning nuts were placed in a
“stable” and held in readiness to meet
challengers. While this was going on
the various “horse-owners” would be'
scoffing nuts, and it was nothing for each
competitor to eat three or four bags of
nuts during the evening, yet the attacks
of “brewer’s melancholy” the following
morning were no worse or better than
those after nights when the nuts were
not obtainable.,

“F.S.”: The proposed Melbourne
sound-shell to be constructed as a
memorial to Melba will be on the lines
of the Hollywood Bowl, with a seating-
capacity of 20,000. The Hollywood
prototype was opened in 1922 with a
symphony concert directed by Alfred
Hertz of the Metropolitan Opera House,
New York. It covers an area* of 65 acres
near Hollywood’s business section and
has the same seating-capacity as the Mel-
bourne project. A summer season of
eight weeks is held each year with one
night a week of orchestral music, one to
opera and a third to a recital by some
famous artist. Prices are so low that
Mum, Dad and the kids can enjoy the
best music at no greater cost than a visit
to the pictures. Shells or bowls haven’t
the acoustical disadvantage of the nnen
tne acoustical disadvantage of the open
air concerts m the Botanic Gardens, which
often merely spoil good music

“C.W.”: At a sitting of the Local Land
Board I arrived half-way through the
hearing of my neighbor Brown’s applica-
tion for permission to dam the creek flow-
ing through his property. Apart from
officials and Brown’s wife, sitting in the
public gallery, the courtroom was empty,
The chairman believed in going very fully
into the minutest details and evidently
“Look! That's probably Dr. Evatt — somewhere ?”
considered himself the person best quali-
fied to supply them. Suddenly, in the
midst of a ten-minute lecture on “riparian
rights,” he broke off and turning to Mrs.
Brown said, “Madam, are you an in-
terested party?” Madam replied, “No,
I’m bored stiff/ I’m only waiting for my
old man.”

“P.0.M.C.”: Baldy the linesman sat on
a box in the manhole jointing a maze of
wires. His mate leaned on his elbows on
the guard-rail above, watching him casu-
ally, “You look crook this morning,
Baldy.” “Yes,” Baldy admitted grudg-
ingly. “Bit off color.” A tram went by.
“See Jim Crawshaw’s dead,” his mate
went on. Baldy glanced up sharply. “Jim
Crawshaw! When?” he demanded in-
credulously. “Saturday. Collapsed in
the pub.” “Gripes! I’d have taken a
lease on Jim’s life,” said Baldy. “Just
shows you—you never know whose turn’s
next.” “What odds?” his mate philoso-
phised. “We’ve all got to go sometime.
Them that’s gone are one up on us—
they’ve got it over.” Baldy pondered this
sentiment for a moment, then said with
obvious feeling: “Yes, but I don’t mind
waiting.”

“Uco”: The Indian Government has
asked its universities to do away with
English as the medium Of instruction,
suggesting five years as the period in
which the changeover could be effected.
The suggestion appeals to the Indian
national spirit, but
does not commend
itself so strongly to
professional men and
others directly
affected by the pro-
posal. These have
pointed out that
Hindi and other
Indian languages are
deficient in vocabu-
laries suitable for
imparting instruction
in medicine, science
and technical sub-
jects and that the
task of inventing
•substitutes and get-
ting them accepted
by people who are
already familiar
with English termi-
nology would be. a
very tough one. No
doubt this compara-
tively minor problem
of new-nationhood
will solve itself, but,
as an Indian jour-
nalist has pointed
out, it is going to
be rather a hard
jo b persuading
Indian youngsters to
say “vidyutdwanik-
s h e p a g rahakayan-
tram” instead of radio
and “samabhujasamanthara-chathurbu-
jam” instead of rhombus. Radio is a
good example, but I don’t know why
the writer chose rhombus as his other
one. It’s a hideous word, anyway, and
at a rough guess i would say that sama-
bhujasametc probably means much the
same as our schoolboy definition “a
S£ l uare pushed out of shape”

“Clooter”; Everybody is familiar with
the “touchers” and “lepers” of both
sexes—people who can’t resist touching
wet paint, exposed switches and other
plainly marked danger-spots, and those
who can’t see a wall without wanting to
peep over, through or under it—but a
worse proposition is the man or woman
who can t see the obvious. This is the
type who sees a savage dog rushing at
him and goes forward with outstretched
hand, saying, “Poor dog. I wonder
what’s up with it?” or reads a warning,
“Keep clear of rails,” and promptly leans
over the rail to see why. An extreme type
bobbed up the other day in California.
She drove a car to a railway crossing,
saw the signals wigwagging and drove
on to the line so she could see what was
coming. To her astonishment it was a
train. She lived, but the car didn’t. I
was explaining this to the missus, point-
ing the moral, and I could see she appreci-
ated the point, though she is not a car-
driver. “Still,” she remarked. “There
wasn’t any other way for her to see what
was coming, was there?”

“St. Peters”: “Melbn” (B. 8/12/’4B) is
astray in his derivation of the name Mel-
bourne. Lord Melbourne, in whose
honor the Victorian capital was named,
derived his title from Melbourne, in
Derbyshire ; there is also a Melbourne in
Yorkshire, and a Melbourn in Cambridge-
shire, All three existed before the
Norman Conquest and are derived from
Anglo-Saxon sources. The Derbyshire
Melbourne was written in Domesday
Book “Mileburne” and in 1164 and 1219
“MelebUrne”; its meaning is “mill
stream.” Melbourne in Yorkshire was
also mentioned in Domesday Book and
was written “Middleburne,” meaning the
“middle stream” from its position to some
“Any old clothes. Miss ?”
other streams. By 1285 the name was
written “Medelburne,” the Old English
form being replaced by the Old Scan-
dinavian “medal” (middle), hence its pre-
sent contraction 1 . The Cambridgeshire
Melbourn was written “Meldeburne” in
an early charter and “Melleburne” in
Domesday Book. Professor Skeat, a
great authority on Old and Middle
English, considered this name meant the
“stream of Melda” (an Old English per-
sonal name meaning “interpreter”), but
another authority on place-names. Pro-
fessor Ekwall, favors the meaning “orach
stream,” the Old English name for orach
or mountain-spinach being “melde.”
* * * *
“Doggo”; If the Bloodhound Breeders’
Association of Great Britain is to be
believed—and who would doubt the word
of such a body?—no animal has been
more unjustly maligned in fiction than
the bloodhound. The association is con-
cerned at the possibility of the breed
dying out; this year only 21 animals were
registered at the Kennel Club against a
pre-war average of 4 140, and there are
only about 30 adults of the breed in the
Kingdom. As these represent only
three families inbreeding threatens the
extinction of the bloodhound, though
there has been a suggestion of importing
new strains from America. Another sug-
gestion'is cross-breeding with fox-hounds.
The traditional idea of a
hound dragging down a runaway slave
or an escaped convict is apparently all
wrong. One enthusiast for the breed says
of the bloodhound that “he hunts a man,
as he has been trained to hunt his master,
out of love for the human race.” In that
case the offspring of a bloodhound-fox-
hound mating would find himself in a
quandary with love of man and love of
fox for ever fighting for supremacy within
him.

“Jemac”: The Shaw Savill motor-liner
Dominion Monarch, soon to be seen in ,
her old ports in S. Africa, Australia and
Maoriland, is in a class by herself. She’s
the company’s flagship and carries only
first-class passengers, yet more cargo
than most cargo ships. Completed
in 1939 at a cost of £li million, her
present value is probably twice that. Her
capacity is indicated by her war-time
loadings—nearly 90,000 troops and other
passengers and 70,000 tons of butter,
cheese and meat carried to Britain. She
left London this month with 2000 tons
of cargo for Australia, 8000 tons for New
Zealand, and Dr. Evatt.
* * * *
“Spasebo”: A new marriage-and-
divorce code reported to be promulgated
in Russia is a far cry from the early aims
and ideals of the founders of the Revo-
lution. Sex was to be completely freed
from its conventional shackles, divorce to
be had for the asking or on such grounds
as the “ideological incompatibility” of
one’s life-mate, and there were even some
parts of the country where nationalisa-
tion was extended to the women. One
whole-hearted advocate of freedom estab-
lished a record of 70 wives within the
first few years of the new dispensation.
The new code recalls John Knox’s Scot-
land, and is the most restrictive in Europe.
Divorces are forbidden to all couples with
offspring, and in those cases adultery is
rewarded with a. five-year term in prison.
The old romantic notion that youth and
beauty should mix has suffered a revival,
and persons whose ages are 10 or more
years apart will not be allowed to marry.
Under this law one of the most fruitful
marriages in history —that of Pierre and
Marie Curie —would only just have
scraped through by one year, Cosima
von Bulow wouldn’t have had a chance
of becoming Mrs. Wagner, and Rodin
would have landed himself in jail.
* * * *
“Carlyle”; If it’s boners you’re seeking
take a peep at your youngster’s stamp-
collection. A set of stamps issued by the
St. Kitts-Nevis Islands show Columbus
sighting land through a telescope. I
seem to recall that
Columbus sailed the ocean blue
In fourteen hundred and ninety-two,
yet telescopes weren’t invented till 1608!
A similar howler is often made by phila-
telists trying to explain the unusual shape
of early Cape of Good Hope stamps.
They claim that the triangle was the
ancient symbol of the diamond, and the
shape was chosen because of the colony’s
connection with that industry. The
stamps were issued in 1853; diamonds
were not discovered there until 1868!
* * * *
“Unicorn”: Our accent! A friend,
mother of a young family, at last secured
a maid. The girl wasn’t good for much
except collecting her pay-envelope, but
one day a friend —a keen gardener who
was very fond of roses but didn’t know
much about them—thought she had at
last found one thing in which the lass
could be helpful. Coming into the
kitchen, she put a basket of freshly-cut
roses on the table. The girl pointed at
them and said “Charle de Martin?”
Well, fancy her knowing the name of a
French rose, thought friend. Now I’ll
be able to leam something. But her
delight ended when the lass pointed again
to the table —at the shoulder of mutton
beside the basket —and asked if it was
to be cooked for dinner. Roasts of
mutton are now known as “Sharlder-
martin” in that family!
FOUR BOB A WORD.
“A Paris newspaper estimates that the ten million
words spoken at the recent "U.N.O. powwow cost the
organisation 175 francs (four shillings) a word.”
It sort of brings to mind the phrase that Winnie
Gave to the world in ’Forty-one or -two.
Never before was there a time so many
Had owed so much (he told them) to so few.
Contrariwise, it well may be surmised at,
Never before have all who’ve read or heard
Derived so little from symposia priced at
Four bob a word.
They met, the spokesmen of a crowd' of nations,
Great Powers and others of a pint-sized type,
United in vociferous altercations,
Wallowed in floods of propagandist tripe,
Bickered and snarled and prosed and railed
and rated,
And in the main resultlessly conferred.
And at what cost? Roughly, it’s estimated,
Four bob a word.
Say, has this cosmopolitan convention
Effected anything that may be seen?
True, Evatt tells us that it’s eased the tension
Between the Powers —whatever that may mean.
But Russia’s still as ready to protest at
All moves for peace, entirely undeterred
By all these stacks of verbiage assessed at
Four bob a word.
A second League of Nations? And as brittle
As Woodrow Wilson’s pipe-dream, it may be,
Which aimed to do so much and did so little
For disillusionised humanity:
And truly U.N.O.’s managed nothing bigger
To date than loosing a ten-million herd
Of words, upon its debit side to figure
Four bob a word.

THE SERVICE MAN
The 34th Comes Home.
“Ek Dum”: For the 34th
Brigade of the Australian Mili-
tary Forces this month ends an
era.
Two of its battalions and
ancillaries are home or partly
home to be divided, alas, be-
tween States, and to lose many
of the features which have made
for their smartness and cohesion.
No more, apparently, will
they be able to wear the Roman
numerals which stand out so
grandly on the arms of 34th
infantrymen. Their white web-,
bing and scarlet sergeant’s
sashes will be hung away in the
wardrobe, it being a character-
istic of the Australian military
organisation that it is, like death,
a leveller. Regimental pride and
peculiarities are looked on as if
they were an attack of plague.
Any spirit of emulation is
crushed flat. The only bodies
of troops which are able to
escape the dreary sameness of
uniform and behavior are the
Scotties. And the results of their
peculiarities are seen in enlist-
ments in the Citizen Forces. The
30th Battalion in Sydney is full
to overflowing—it has literally
grown out of its kilts.
If the Japan force were
allowed to keep the details of
uniform, the little bits of “side”
which have made them the most
admired troops in Japan and the
best advertisement this country
has had, it would be just too
bad. It is very difficult to
understand this attitude, in the
depressing atmosphere of Aus-
tralian defence at present one
would expect anything which
would develop a spark of en-
thusiasm to be encouraged and
watered.
A Brigade Is Built
The first steps towards the
birth of the 34th Brigade, which
originally consisted of no fewer
than 71 units, before Base was
detached, were taken at Morotai
early in October, 1945. The
materials from which it was to
be built were called in from the
jungles and the swamps of the
adjacent fighting areas—H.Q.
from the 34th Brigade,
Seventh Division, A.1.F., along
with the nucleus of the 65th
Battalion. The 66th Battalion,
that proud unit which has been
doing guard duty before the
gates of the Emperor’s Palace in
Tokyo, and which has adopted
the Japanese marching song
“Ringo Rhee” “The Red
Apple”—as its own, came from
the Ninth Division in Borneo.
The 67th Battalion came from
the far-flung Third, Fifth, Sixth
and 11th Divisions in Wewak,
Bougainville and New Britain.
Some units were based on
Morotai troops. All were
volunteers.
The first to arrive were units
formed in s.-e. Borneo, These
came in on October 27, 1945,
and Brigadier R. H. Nimmo
opened his H.Q. two days later.
The work of getting the bat-
talions and their ancillaries to-
gether on the sweating little isle
was depressingly tedious. Speed
was dependent on shipping, for
which the whole world was
claiming priority. There were
months of restlessness and in-
action, much grumbling. Hope
was very often deferred. Noth-
ing was constant except the heat
and the equatorial discomforts
for which Morotai was already
famous. Sometimes it seemed as
if the whole force would be
long enough in the island to
be buried there.
All the units, officers included,
were somewhat sick of the strain
when it became apparent in
January, 1946, that small de-
tachments attached to the U.S.
forces under Brigadier W. M.
Anderson had not gone to
Japan in vain.
Towards the end of the month
a reconnaissance party was
flown into the Kure area to join
tne Base Commander, Brigadier
A. G. Wilson, and the Chief
Engineer of 8.C.0.F., Colonel
J. M. McGowan, who were on
the spot.
Any excitement in the first
consignment of troops which
went by ship was frozen out of
them almost immediately when
they arrived in the Stamford
Victory on February 13, 1946.
It was a bitter day, very much
in contrast to the Morotai
weather. Kure was still full of
wreckage. It was like landing on
a hostile shore, since the ad-
vance parties had been there less
than three weeks. 8.C.0.F.
H.Q. were not yet established,
but they were opened at Kure
on February 20, a day ahead of
the arrival of a new batch of
troops. On February 26 Lieu-
tenant - General . Northcott,
C.-in-C. of 8.C.0.F., arrived in
Japan, with the H.Q. of
B. hard on his heels.
Kaitachi Days
The first plan was that all the
34th Brigade should be based
On the lovely island of Eta Jima,
site of the former Japanese
naval officers’ training base. The
island is a pleasant run across
the Soun4 of Kure, comparable
“There appear to be a few stockings here, Prendergast.”
to that from Circular Quay, in
Sydney, to Watson’s Bay, but it
was decided to send the troops
to Kaitachi, as being more suit-
able for operations in general
and for liaison with the British,
who were going into Hiro, about
four miles from Kure.
Kaitachi could not, by any
stretch of the imagination, be
called either a healthy or a com-
fortable camp. And veterans
who enjoyed its amenities are
not likely to forget it. It was
packed like a sardine-tin.
However, within the next
couple of months the force be-
gan to settle down. The squeeze
was eased when the 67th Bat-
talion was moved into barracks
at the Nippon Steel Works in
March, and the 65th Battalion,
at the end of the month, was
transferred to Fukuyama, a town
about 75 miles up the Inland
Sea coast from Kure. It was
once the centre of a great feudal
lordship, with some lovely sur-
roundings, especially among the
adjacent islands. It had, how-
ever, been battered to pieces with
one terrific raid with fire-bombs
and was at that time not a very
pleasant spot to frequent. Early
in the following month a com-
pany had been detached to
Onomichi, a busy, picturesque
whaling-station of about 60,000
people, with a low-lying heart
commanding sweeping views
and nestling close into a hilly
amphitheatre, the hills topped
with Buddhist temples. Apart
from whaling, it has always
been a great centre for the ex-
port of rush and straw products.
In due course the 67th had H.Q.
at Okayama, capital of a pre-
fecture.
Before these moves had been
made the troops had already
been initiated into their work.
They had taken care of Eta
Jima until relieved by the Dor-
sets after the battalions began
to move out. They had begun
handling of Jap prisoners under
repatriation who were coming
into Ujina, the naval depot
which stood almost intact on the
waterfront of Hiroshima, which
itself was flat, ploughed up and
charred to a cinder with a few
skeleton buildings standing in
the middle of the waste against
the lovely background of the
mountains.
By April they had settled in to
some extent. The other troops
were pouring in. A composite
unit from the three battalions
of the 34th went to Tokyo to
jointly provide guards for the
Palace Gate. They did their
first ceremonial duty on May 4.
The New Command
On May 13 Brigadier R.
N. L. Hopkins assumed
command. He is a tall, equable
lighthorseman, impressive
in appearance, a splendid
organiser, a fighter for his men
and an excellent disciplinarian.
He had been a main planner of
the Kokoda Trail march, was
one of Australia’s best-known
authorities on armor, virtually
the father of the idea of an
armored division equipped with
Australian-built tanks, and was
responsible for the main part of
the planning of the tank-firing
ranges in the Puckapunyal and
Singleton ajeas. He came from
command of . the Australian
Staff Cpllege to Japan. He has
commanded the 34th ever since
and has been thus entirely re-
sponsible for the Australian
component in 8.C.0.F. He will
now take command of the
Fourth Military District (S.
Australia).
He came at a time when the
U.S. forces were moving out of
western Nippon and the British
Commonwealth forces moving
in to form one of the biggest
peace - time aggregations of
troops ever seen east of India
and Burma. Lieutenant-General
Robertson arrived to take over
from General Northcott on |
June 15, to find plans in train i
to move the centre of gravity of |
the Brigade to Hiro.
On July 11, when the Brigade!
took over all responsibilities for)
occupation in Hiroshima pre-
fecture, its H.Q., the Ist
Armored Car Squadron, 28th
Field Coy., 66th Battalion and
the Brigade provost company
moved to the flat land of Hiro,
which at first was not much
more comfortable than Kaitachi.
In 4 September it lost its wet
canteen, and two of the old
Jap barrack-blocks which were
occupied became untenable.
Before the move to Hiro, how-
ever, the 28th Australian Field
Company, R.A.E., had begun
work on the planning of the
procured projects which re-
solved themselves into the ex-
tensive military barracks and
living and amusement towns of

Hiro and Nijimura, the exten-
sive suburb devoted to “de-
pendent housing,” and building
a battalion centre at Fukuyama.
By the early months of 1947
life was running busily and gaily
for the Brigade. It had reason-
able housing, amenities in
general such as Australian sol-
diers have never before seen
and are never likely to see
again outside Japan, sporting
facilities, gift shops. Kure and
other areas had been cleaned
up and the Japanese had come
so far into line and become so
inured to Australian ways and
culture that there was even an
emporium called the Bern-
borough Gift Shop!
Sport had been developed on
an Australian scale and morale
was high—the Brigade in Octo-
ber, 1946, had its first great
athletic triumph by defeating
the best of 8.C.0.F., which had
by that time been swollen to
the proportions of a divisional
group, in an 18-event athletic
programme. It repeated this
victory the next year.
At the beginning of 1947 the
66th Battalion took over the
Tokyo Guard, replacing the
5/1 Punjabis. This was at the
highwater-mark period of the
8.C.0.F. force, which began to
dwindle during a severe winter.
The first 2000 of the British
troops sailed in February, 1947,
and a large number of the In-
dians and British went out in
March. The Gurkhas and the
Royal Indian Air Force were
cleared in July. In March,
1947, the 34th took over
Shikoku Island, in addition to
Hiroshima, This gave the First
Armored Car Squadron a
chance to test its powers in large
blackmarketing raids.
The Indian forces were
entirely cleared by the end of
October, 1947, and after that
preparations began for the re-
moval of the British and Maori-
landers, and the force became
more and more Australian, with
the 34th Brigade more to the
fore in the 20,000 square miles
of the western prefectures which
were the playground of 8.C.0.F,
Field Training
Hire’s domestic scene ex-
panded steadily, Nijimura, its
residential area, now had 213
families, nearly 200 of them
Australian, housed in modern
American-type bungalows with
all the comforts of home
and more., Most of these
families came in after May,
1947. Life was brightened by
the existence of a large picture-
theatre and a talent quest, which
produced remarkable results.
Clearing-up arid repatriation
duties being out of the way,
Brigadier Hopkins and his merry
men were able to take field-
training more seriously. This
was mainly carried out near
Okayama, a tough Korean and
Communist - infested city 200
miles up the Inland Sea, at
Haramura, about 20 miles from
Kure, and at Shigaku in the
Shimane prefecture.
In August the 66th moved—
H.Q. to Hache Hommatsu,
two companies to Haramura and
one to Shigaku.
The training was in general
rough and the exercises on a
battle basis with artillery and
air-support in full blast. The
Australian force had among it
more war veterans than were
seen anywhere else in Japan,
and these were a great asset in
bringing the new levies up to
standard.
Those who took part will re-
member the Sambayama exer-
cises and the Hiro unit 100-
mile route-march of September,
as well as the Nipponbara
(67th) manoeuvres about the
same time, all their lives.
Going Home
Towards the end emphasis
was also placed on training for
civil life for the many members
of the Brigade who were going
back to civil life on their return
tp Australia. The workshop
and trade-school at Hiro was on
an imposing scale, and owed as
much to the enthusiasm of in-
structors as to official provision.
It has done very fine work, and
many of those coming home
will have reason to thank it for
the groundwork which it has
given them in their chosen occu-
pation.
To most 34th Brigaders Japan
will recall a pleasant, if in the
early stages arduous, period in
their lives. And the thousands
of Japanese to whom they gave
employment will remember
them with affection. It is safe
to say that there was about as
much weeping over their de-
parture as there was over the
bombing in the areas which they
frequented. They come back
With a proud record of good
behavior. Their crime record
was next to nothing and their
deportment in general some-
thing to make an Australian
proud of his countrymen.
It is a pity that so much of
their experience will be lost to
the country through their split-
ting-up and the demobilisation
of so many of their already
dwindled units. And it is
to be hoped that before they
are finally dispersed some steps
will be taken to allow Austra-
lian cities to see them as Japan
has seen them.
A recruiting tour by their
guards should do a great deal
to rope in badly-needed mem-
bers for the Citizen Forces.
Manoeuvres and
Shortages.
“Ek Dum”: Every week
brings more alarm and uneasi-
ness at the state of British Com-
monwealth defence.
Britain has been forced to
wake up through the imminence
of the danger, with Russia pre-
paring to take over Berlin and
Vienna and already in posses-
sion of Eastern Europe and with
a fifth-column foothold in
France and Italy, not to mention
Australia, and China about to
fall into Communist hands.
But the awakening has come
very late at a moment when at
one end of the international line
China is a ruin and at the other
Russia is bullying the Scandi-
navian countries, and it is cost-
ing endless money to keep the
Berlin air-lift going.
British occupation of the Wes-
tern 1 German zone has cost
£500,000,000 so far, which is
probably nothing to a Govern-
ment with its head in the air,
but a great deal to the groaning
taxpayers. It is equal to about
the whole of the cost of Britain’s
“imperialistic” wars of the
nineteenth century.-
When the war was “over,” in
spite of the warnings of Mr.
Churchill and others, India was
thrown away, our defensive
bases on the trade-routes handed
out to anybody who was pre-
pared to demand them. The
Fleet was dispersed and most of
the major capital ships either
scrapped or sealed in plastic, the
theory being that when they
were needed all you would need
to do would be to unwrap them
and start shooting. Thus, crews
were dispersed, organisation
broken to pieces and the familiar
sight of the White Ensign in
the far places of the ehrth, so
soothing to heated feelings and
so symbolical of Britain’s
strength and long arm, was well
on the way to being forgotten.
In Australia the notion has
grown up among Ministers that
navies and armies are obsolete,
though a couple of light air-
craft-carriers which the Ad-
miralty doesn’t want and which
are being patched and re-
modelled somehow in process of
building to make them look rea-
sonably up to date are being
taken over.
For the past few months of
the summer season the British
Government, flustered and
alarmed, has been trying to
retrieve its position with varia-
tions of the conscription law
and with the ordering of
manoeuvres by fleets—which
consist of one overworked
battleship, a few carriers, and
cruisers, and destroyers.
Surely no battleship, fresh
from a major war which carried
it to the ends of the earth, has
had such a strain put on it in
peace-time as Duke of York in
the past four months.
The R.A.F., except for its
transport department, which it
took considerable time to build
up, is scarcely worth a cup of
tea today against a major force,
if its recent showings mean
anything.
And what is not much rea-
lised is that the Berlin air-lift,
which Lord Tedder holds up as
an example of efficiency and as
something on which Britons can
build a feeling of security, is
wearing out our basic transport
capacity.
The earlier exercises this year
between the Royal Navy and
the R.A.F. were feeble enough,
but the one which has just now
been held ig a startling exposi-
tion of the position. It is true
that it was stormy weather and
that the Command apparently
decided not to send aircraft out
into it. But if operations are
carried on only in optimum
weather, of what use are they?
The grim facts are that a
weak fleet, in the exercises, was
able to steam almost right up to
the front door of Devonport for
1000 miles without suffering
more than superficial token
damage.
The R.A.F. was unable to
bomb the fleet. Oqly one air-
craft out of 34 found its mark.
Some sort of land defence was
scrambled together by scraping
the bottom of the Territorial
barrel.
That they were able to find a
few will fill Canberra with envy.
At ceremonials held in some of
the Australian H.Q. the whole
resources of the Command have
to be scraped to find, say, a
guard of about 40 men, and of
those 10 per cent, may fumble
in fixing bayonets.
This sounds ridiculous in a
country which is spending
£50,000,000 a year on “defence”
and which has six Defence
Ministers. But it clearly repre-
sents the position in Australian
defence.
China's Travail.
“Ek Dum”; Though news is
so limited that virtually there
isn’t any except for bald state-
ments from the combatants, it
seems that, for all practical pur-
poses, the position in China is
roughly as follows:
The “Chinese” Communists
occupy, or completely control,
the whole of Manchukuo, about
500,000 square miles with a
population of about 40,000,000.
This was the area which was
captured from Japan and which
was to have come under the
control of the Chinese National
Government.
They control, further south,
all the railway and internal-
communication systems and the
main river systems north of the
Yang-tsz. They have not got
either Nanking or Shanghai,
though Peking and Tientsin ap-
pear to be either theirs or likely
to be theirs within a few days.
They have possession of, or
can immobilise, the whole of
the main iron and steel and coal
industries of China. The chief
iron centres are in Anhwei and
Hupeh, and though the rebels
have not penetrated that far in
force, they can cut off fuel sup-
plies from the north. The big
coal districts are in Shansi, some
distance west of the Yellow Sea,
Chihli, which lies between it and
the sea, Honan, Hopei and
Shantung, slightly to the south.
All these areas the Communists
have penetrated or overrun.
They now dominate the whole
of the winter- and spring-wheat
areas —in fact, most of the wheat
districts of the whole country.
Much of this is a famine area,
and won’t do them a great deal
of good.
They hold nearly 2,000,000
square miles out of China’s
3,000,000 square miles and going
on for 200,000,000 of its popu-
lation in actual thrall or under
threat.
One of the most ominous fea-
tures about the whole business
is the acquiescent attitude of
the British Socialist Govern-
ment, It is reported to actually
prefer a Chinese Communist
Government to the Chiang Kai-
shek Government. It should
know better by now.

OF GOOD WINE -
FOR MORE THAN :
—A CENTURY—
PERIANAL ITEMS
Frank Keane, of Sydney, is, by pro-
fession, a solicitor; by taste, he is the
winemaster of a group of Sydney gour-
mets who gather weekly under the banner
of the Wine and Food Society to pro-
pagate in Australians whose palates
are reputedly among the world’s least dis-
cerning—a proper appreciation of fine
foods and wines. Keane tables the wines,
Madame Rainaud the food, and members,
after justice has been done both, rise
and attempt to identify and pronounce
judgment on the various viands. Apart
from the grape-juice—all Australian —•
the most refreshing part of the gourman-
dising is the frankness with which
members criticise fellow-members’ criti-
cism.
Had their Majesties landed at Flinders
Naval Depot, among those present would
,have been Surgeon-Captain Lionel Lock-
wood, M.V.0., D.S.C., R.A.N., pictured
here wearing the aiglettes denoting him
to be the King’s honorary surgeon, an
honor conferred on him in 1946.
Some readers might write to point out
that the “loafers’ loops” are on the wrong
side —they’re not. When S.M.O. of

cruiser Australia after she took the Duke
of Gloucester home from his Centenary
visit, he was made a member of the Vic-
torian Order for his personal services to
H.R.y. The D.S.C. was added whilst in
Hobart in the Java Sea battle. He
joined the R.A.N. in 1924, collected his
m.d. in Melbourne in 1930 and is now
in charge of Flinders Naval Hospital. FTe
has made the service m.o.’s lot more
interesting there and gets commendation
from all and sundry for his fostering of
the team spirit. At sport he is still a
sound all-rounder who excelled at Aussie
Rules.
Cecil MeVilly, chairman of,the newly-
created Hospitals and Charities’ Commis-
sion in Victoria, is a Tasmanian who
served for a time with Lieut.-General
Savige in Mesopotamia in the famous
Dunsterforce, commanded by Kipling’s
Stalky. He was Australian sculling
champion 40 years ago and won the
Diamond Sculls at Henley (Eng.).
“Macnell” meets a ship’s doctor:
When the WanganeUa steamed through Syd-
ney Heads last week she had a new 400-ton
lower-jaw, refitted from 26ft. up her stem aft
to the engine-room bulkheads. The man who
treated her is Harry Hamilton, assistant ship-
yard manager of Harland and Wolff’s, of Bel-
fast, the firm which built WanganeUa. As
they had her plans it was a simple matter —or
so says Hamilton, who helped to build R.N.
cruisers and carrier Formidable and will resume
work on the new carrier Eagle when he re-
turns by Constellation—to cut out her damaged
Innards, build a replica in Belfast, ship it out
like a Meccano set and rivet it on to Wan-
ganella’s opened hull in Wellington. While
awaiting treatment, one-third of the ship’s
length would have been unsupported, so they
welded angle-irons on to her sides just below
deck-level and held her up with vertical shores,
made of Australian ironb'ark, wedged beneath
them. When she was finished —and Hamilton says
the local boilermakers and shipwrights worked
well, considering their inexperience of such big
jobs—compartments were filled with water at a
pressure of 151 b. per sq. in. There were no
spurts, and consequently no qualms when the
floating dock was sunk and the patient returned
to her native element. Hamilton served in a
merchantman disguised as battleship Colling-
wood in the first scrap, has nothing but praise
for Whyalla and B.H.P.’s works in Newcastle,
and immense respect for the miracle that kept
Wellington harbor flat calm for the fortnight
or so WanganeUa lay on Barrett’s Reef. He
is not the only one so impressed—in the Windy
City they still refer to a calm day as “Wan-
ganella weather.”
Probably the first British Admiral to
ship as a merchant-navy captain, Admiral
Sir Charles Morgan reached Australia
the other day in the Denbighshire from
Shanghai, having transhipped there from
the Clytoneus, in which he was staff
captain. On a special mission of liaison
between the Navy and the Red Duster,
Sir Charles aims to perpetuate the
mateship engendered between both
Services when they lately sailed
together in convoys and supply-runs.
Director of Navigation at the Admiralty
when Hitler marched, he soon got the
command of battleship Valiant in the
Mediterranean, and had her when her
15-inchers got in their close-range slam
at Italy’s cruiser line off C. Matapan.
The Admiral mentioned the smart fasten-
ing of Valiant’s searchlights on to the
targets, a telling facto? in the scrapping
of two cruisers in not many more minutes.
They were controlled from the battler’s
bridge by a young midshipman, now
better known as the Duke of Edinburgh.
A.N.A. has lost another of its fine
company in Edwin |lam, a 27-year-old
pilot who gave his own life trying to save
his boy from their burning home in Bris-
bane. There is grim irony in the fact
that he died while attempting rescue of
his own kin in peace-time. In the fight
against the laps he won a “mention”
for saving his crew when he crash-
landed his crippled Catalina dur-
ing a Borneo troop-landing and later,
again in a Catalina, he rescued the crew
of a downed Beaufighter north of the
Halmaheras. Two of his war-time crew
flew from Sydney to his funeral.
Governor Latrobe and Henry Condell,
Melbourne’s first Mayor, no doubt saw
plenty of stockwhips cracked in their time,
but not in the office of the Lord
Mayor, where their likenesses witnessed
the testing of a 14ft. greenhide bull-whip
by its maker, 68-year-old Hugh Fraser,
before Lud Mayor Disney the other day.
A South African soldier had been given
a similar whip by a Young Digger just
before Alamein, but had lost it in a
Durban fire. He wrote to Disney for a
new one, and Fraser was the obvious
choice to make it. Plaiting whips as a
hobby for half a century, Fraser learned
the art and how to use ’em from his father,
Simon, whose greenhides are still crack-
ing outback today. A pipe-major of
the Royal Caledonian Pipe band for 20
years, Fraser made also the cane carried
by General Blarney in. the last war.
“K.H.H.”: Rolf Harris, an 18-year-old
W.A. University student, has recently be-
come a.member of the Royal Art Society
of N.S.W. He started young, with a self-
portrait in oils hung in the Sydney Art
Gallery at the age of 16, and at present is
painting landscapes near Marble Bar
(W.A.). A bit of an all-rounder, Harris
has represented his iState at swimming,
will swim for his ’Varsity at the inter-
’Vafsity carnival in Melbourne, and
intends to stop at Adelaide on the way
back to paint a few' commissioned por-
traits. He also finds time for study.
Queensland Ambulance deputy-super-
intendent John McWilliam, who has called
it a day after 35 years of carting suffering
humanity to medical attention, re-
members Brisbane’s brigade when it com-
prised a mare pulling an old wagon—now
a fleet of 39 cars serves the city. Until
the brigade bought its first car, a French-
built Clement Bayard, all bearers walked,
and McWilliam himself once pushed a
litter carrying an injured man from Mt.
Gravatt to Brisbane, with a mate walk-
ing alongside with a shading umbrella.
And in those days ambulance-men’s
prestige was higher ; instruments included
a visiting-card and a walking-stick—the
latter, apparently, more use than orna-
ment.
Dr. A. M. Gwynn, a young Dublin
medico, will administer the remotest
practice in the world when he takes up
his job of base m.o. at Heard Island with
the Australian Antarctic Expedition.
Ship’s doctor of a freighter berthed in
Melbourne when he heard the post was
vacant, he will not be concerned only
with the health of the rock-dwellers ; he

medicine.
Retiring on the eve of his 96th. birth-
day, George Henry Wise, oldest practis-
ing solicitor in Australia, and one-time
Federal Assistant Minister of Defence
under W. M. Hughes. As tough as they
come. Wise could, until recently,
be seen making his way along the
streets to his son’s office in Melbourne to
transact his business. He lives at Sale,
and in that town, where he hung out his
first shingle in 1876, after travelling to
Melbourne per horse-coach to do his
finals, he is still in pretty well every civic
activity. A past chief president of the
Australian Natives Association, he
founded the Sale Technical School in
1885. In 1921 he was P.M.G.
L. M. Chinner, chief of the Victorian
“Hansard” staff, is due to retire on De-
cember 31 after nearly half a century of
transmuting gas into print. In his time
he recorded speeches by Barton, Deakin,
Reid and Isaac Isaacs. “Hansard” notes
are pretty well sacrosanct, but his were
once confiscated. This was during the
Raiser’s scrap, when Senator Long (Tas-
mania) made a scathing—though un-
knowingly prophetic—attack on our allies
the Japs. The Government ordered de-
struction of the notes. Chinner’s son
John, 1939 Rhodes scholar, owns Albert
Dunstan as father-in-law.
When a Bulletin man called on
Lieut.-General Sir Bernard Freyberg,
Maoriland’s G.-G. visiting Australia, the
V.C., as might be expected, took the
offensive. He grabbed the scribe’s arm
and pronounced emphatically: “Now,
whatever you do, you must remember
me to that exceptional artist of yours,
Norman Lindsay. An extremely capable
man —I’ve admired his work for fifty
years.” The scribe, himself no midget,
looked up into the soldier’s intense eyes,
freed himself as unobtrusively as he
could from the fingers impressing a coat
pattern on his arm and promised that he
would. Prior has captured the impres-
sion of powerful shoulders —stooped, no
doubt, from continual bending to listen
to lesser mortals —of the swimmer who,
on Gallipoli’s dawn, pushed a raft laden
with flares on to the beach to draw the
Turk’s fire from, what was coming to
him further down. It was a frosty night
and he was naked and painted black.
Even for the 1910 Enzed senior swim-
ming champion it was a tough two-hour
swim, but he did it, crawled through the
scrub to listen to the enemy talking, lit

his decoys and swam back. For this
Freyberg won the D. 5.0., the first of his
string of gongs. One amendment of what
has passed for history has come out of
his present visit: in Melbourne he refuted
the 30-year-old furph that as a youth he’d
fought under Pancho Villa in the
Mexican Civil War, He told assembled
Diggers he’d never been in Mexico in his
life.
Before the Musica Viva Society was
formed in 1945 Australia’s two big capi-
tals were virtually starved of chamber
works by the masters. The argument ad-
vanced by timid ones that works for the
small ensemble would have too limited
an appeal for the venture to pay was
scotched by the very first concert given
in Sydney by the M.V. String Quartet.
Since then the society has made great.

strides. Concerts are given regularly
throughout the year in Sydney, Mel-
bourne and Adelaide. A recent tour of
N.Z. was a notable success. Much of
the credit is due to the society’s founder,
its present musical director and violist,
Richard Goldner, and to a livewire
organiser and business manager, Arthur
M. Davis, here pictured by Dubois.
London-born, Davis came to Australia in
1925, and he has probably the best pri-
vate collection of classical fecords in
this country. Sixteen years ago he intro-
duced through 2SM the Sunday Celebrity
programme which has been that station’s
feature since, though Davis doesn’t
handle it now. He used his own records
and read his own well-informed annota-
tions. As thoroughgoing with his other
hobby as with music, he keeps a garden
which is one of Sydney suburb of Cam-
meray’s show-places for rare shrubs.
Dr. B. L. Clarke, the B.M.A.’s new
branch president in Queensland, is
emphatic that if the Government’s health
scheme of things is to be considered by
the 8.M.A., the patient must be allowed
to pick his own doctor, and the doctor
must be free to practise where he pleases.
Clarke’s aversion to restrictions is under-
standable—an Eighth Division man, he
was a prisoner of the Japs in Singa-
pore for nearly three years.
Into the silence:
In Sydney, at 67, William Crowle, who early
in the century started a pushbike business in
a shed in Hyde-street, Adelaide city, and with
the help of Langdon Bonython expanded it into
the large motor-car firm of Eyes and Crowle.
Early in the piece he worked his way to America
and was learning electrics under Edison when
the inventor produced his first storage-batteries,
phonograph and telephone. Transfer of his
business to Sydney after the first war proved
successful, and three years ago Crowle gave
£16,000 to build a home for. delinquent youths
at Ryde, N.S.W. Named “Once Upon a Time,”
the home has rehabilitated a satisfactory per-
centage of the 100-odd boys who have passed
through it.
At 57, Dr. Esmond Shirley Joske, one of
the most popular, of Melbourne’s medicoes.
As well as practising at Prahran, he was m.o.
for several large industrial enterprises. He
served in the 1914 war with the Fourth Light
Horse in Palestine.
In Brisbane, just missing his 86th birthday,
Edward Smart, Toowoomba’s plumber M.P.,
known to a small circle as an unassuming philan-
thropist who helped many a young man into
business in the Downs city. His wife was a
daughter of Darius Hunt, founder of the
Toowoomba “Chronicle,” and a son is S.M.
in Maryborough.
At 85, in Melbourne, Charles Merrett, C.8.E.,
V.D., president of the R.A.S. from 1915 to
1947. In his 32 years of service he saw Vic-
toria’s shop-window more than double its dimen-
sions. A member of the Defence Forces most
of his life, he was an expert rifleman, was three
times commandant of the team which went to
Bisley, and retired in 1920 from the Light Horse
with the rank of colonel. He was a member of
the State Town Planning Commission and the
State Employment Council.


Women's Letters
From Sydney
A Merry Christmas and a Happy New
Year to all the readers of this Letter!
And with the help of U.N.O. or in spite
of it, to all the peoples of the world:
“Peace on Earth. Goodwill to Man!”
Reflections at the “Barber of Seville”:
It would be jolly to have a hairdresser
like Figaro. He would come to my house
fresh from the homes of all the women I
know. He would tell me all the things I ,
wanted to- know about my dearest enemy:
how did she get just that shade of gold in
her hair, and did she use a paste or a
liquid-rouge. Was it true that she and her
husband never spoke to each other in
private, and the name of the one who had
really given her the mink coat. All these
things and more Figaro would tell me.
But, alas! If Figaro told me all about
her, would he not tell her all about me?
Harold Stewart, who went to London
before the war, and is now on the up and
up with the 8.8. C., came back to Sydney
a week or two ago to be with his mother
on her eightieth birthday. Mrs, .Stewart
lives in Gerringong, so Harold hasn’t had
time to look up all his old pals. How-
ever, one old friend he did run into was
airman Tom Holland, who made history
in London by calling in one evening at
the hospital for children in Great
Ormonde-street and handing in an
immense and glorious stalk of bananas
(practically enough to go around Eng-
land). The hospital authorities were de-
lighted, but the Australian airman had
departed without leaving name or
address. Then the 8.8. C. got cracking,
and Mr. Holland was sleuthed by radio
till he told a delighted England of how
he flew the bananas for the sick
youngsters, many of whom had never
seen one before. Harold, who is in town
just now, leaves by air for England in
about a week’s time.
Linda Parker, the Australian soprano
who has done so well with the 8.8. C.
(latterly on its television programmes), was
ordered a rest by her London doctor, and
decided to come home on the Stratheden’s
last trip. In Sydney she made a quick
(and very important) decision; she and
Victor Walmsley were quietly married,
then went honeymooning to the Blue
Mountains. Linda and her husband at
the week-end flew to Melbourne, where,
rest and honeymoon notwithstanding,
she will sing; then off to the Victorian
country town where her mother lives for
her first Christmas-dinner at home in
18 years. Australians will be hearing a
good deal more of Linda in 1949.
Some morning when you wake up
feeling like the young hart leaping on the
mountain-tops you must visit the exhibi-
tion in the south-east pylon of the harbor
bridge. Because nothing short of perfect
health and the Captain Cook spirit will
sustain you to the pinnacle where the
harbor stretches out like a silver sheet
embossed with warship and liner and
fussy ferries, and dear little Pinchgut.
There are no escalators, no lifts inside the
pylon; weak hearts and thrombosis legs
better give it a miss. It is one steady
climb up steel steps till you arrive at the
first-floor, where you will see let into the
walls the stories in color of Australian
industries; wine from the vine to the
bottle. The whole life of a tomato, too,
is laid open. You’ll like Cedric Flower’s
amusing mural of Old Sydney, and the
maps of Australia, the largest one of
N.S.W. ever built among them, and the
rock garden. Perhaps as much as any-
thing you’ll enjoy the red benches where
you can rest on each landing.
The end-of-the-year meeting of the
Lady Mayoress’s Relief Fund brought
workers from almost every suburb into
the vestibule of the Town Hall. Through-
out 1948 these kindly women have
arranged functions of every description:
balls, afternoons of music, card-parties,
anything and everything that would bring
in the cash. The result was a neatly-
written pile of cheques (many for £130)
handed over last Wednesday to leading
Sydney charities. There».were eulogies for
the retiring Lady Mayoress, Mrs. R. I.
Bartley, and her workers, and all the
listeners clapped loudly to show their
approval.
It was a getting-and-giving morning.
The Lady Mayoress got a silver salver in
farewell, and Hazel Wedlock (official
secretary to the civic hostess) got an
enormous box of flowers. Mr. Simpson,
the genial orderly to the Mayoress, re-
ceived a small gift from the committee
of the fund, and all the people who
didn’t get clapped clapped those who did,
heartily.
The new Lady Mayoress, Mrs. O’Dea,
gentle in voice and manner, was at both
the meeting and the lunch that followed
in the drawing-rooms over which she will
now reign. She wore a smart navy flat
crepe suit banded in white on collar and
cuffs. The new Lord Mayor spent half
an hour or so at the buffet-lunch, which
started with sherry, went on to oysters
and finished with rich, plummy Christmas
cake. Much congratulated on her
recovery from a severe accident was Mrs.
Arthur Scrivener.
Last Sunday the George Duncans re-
newed a pre-war custom, and gave a
Christmas party of great size. The guests
were almost all doctors and their wives.
The first part of the evening was spent in
the long narrow garden that stretches at
the back of the Georgian house from
which Dr. Duncan administers his cure
of body. Sherry launched the evening,
and cups of steaming hot tea rounded it
off about two o’clock on Monday morn-
ing. In between there were all the rich
foods of the season. Mrs. Duncan’s frock
was of blue-and-white-flowered silks. The
Georgian type of architecture is gaining
favor in medical circles. Among the
guests were Dr. and Mrs. Downes, whose
home is one of the few of this period
in Mosman. „
The Leo Listers, of Vaucluse (she is
Gladys Lister, famed for her children’s
and ’teen-age books), gave a grand party
last Friday night. The flowers were
glorious, the company happy, and there
were at least 57 varieties of everything to
eat and drink. For this wedding-anni-
versary celebration the hostess wore a
late-afternoon frock of flat crepe the soft
pink of anemone, and daughter Mrs.
R. G. Eaton wore a white frock and
a cherry-red hat. An outstanding person-
ality among the guests was returned-
traveller Fanny Cohen, principal of Fort-
street Girls’ High. She epitomised
U.N.0.: Paris frock, French hat, English
shoes, and when this Letter met her she
was toying with a caviare sandwich.
Novelists Maysie Grieg and husband Max
Murray added a pint of fun to the night.
There wasn’t a happier party in Sydney
last week than that at the Spastic Centre,
Mosman. And the Navy helped to make
it so. Men of H.M.A.S. Quickmatch and
Quiberon had volunteered for duty early
in the day, and all the little ones who
could not walk from the buses were
carried by the sailors, who during the
lunch waited on tables with great gentle-
ness. They take a great interest in the
centre, and out of their mess-funds they
gave specially-designed nursery furniture
as their Christmas present. The children’s
parents were at this party, and each re-
ceived from the great tree that dominated
the room a gift made by their children.
Molly Dive is, as this picture shows, a
keen out-of-doors girl. Molly is captain
of the N.S.W. women’s cricket team, and
last week was in Brisbane again playing
against the visiting English side. In
Brisbane Molly captained the 1948 Aus-
tralian touring team which played and
won its way through Maoriland (except
Wellington, where the match wasn’t
finished) early this year. Molly is also *a
brisk figure in women’s hockey. Norton

Bishop O’Brien, who has just returned
from Paris and the U.N.O. conference,
had a promotion in his absence. One of
the Sunday-school teachers at St. Joseph’s,
the bishop’s Neutral Bay church, asked
her six-year-olds the other week if they
knew who the Pope was. Up shot every
hand in the class. “Yes, Miss,” they
shrilled with one voice. “He’s Father
O’Brien, he lives next-door to the
church.”
The Yacht Squadron at Kirribilli was
the right setting for a wedding reception
when a Garment was the bridegroom.
The Garment name and the squadron are
linked through years of association.
David Garment and his bride, who was
Diana Sulman, were married in the
chapel of C. of E. Grammar, North
Sydney, and received congratulations at
the squadron. David’s parents are the D. S.
Carments, of Cremorne, and Diana's
father is Mr. Tom Sulman, of Elizabeth
Bay, Her grandfather was Sir John Sul-
man of architectural renown. The new
Mrs. Garment was herself a student of
architecture at Sydney University.
From Melbourne
Dominating the gay scene in the Town
Hall banqueting-room was the large
Christmas-tree, brilliantly lighted and
decorated with silver bells and favors, the
occasion being the Christmas party given
by Lord Mayor Disney and Mrs. Disney
to over 300 guests, Mrs. Disney’s gown
was of deep-brown faille with a self-spot
pattern, tjie skirt having a drape to the
back forming a bustle, the bodice cut to
a square neckline and puff sleeves ; her
long gloves were of the same material as
her gown. With Mrs. H. Lyall, in full-
skirted beige crepe goWn, were her
daughters, Mrs. Iven Mackay, in a del-
phinium lace frock the pattern of which
was outlined with gold beads, and Mrs.
Frank Newman, who wore a gown of
aqua-blue cloque crepe. Mrs. P. L. Cole-
man’s bouffant gown of pastel-pink mar-
quisette had bands on the skirt; the low-
cut bodice was of black Chantilly lace.
Mrs. Fred Hardy’s beige crepe gown was
worn with a short matching jacket em-
broidered with red beads in a leaf de-
sign. A royal-blue crepe gown was worn
by Mrs. Isobel Green, Mrs. J. W. Fer-
guson’s gown was of white embroidered
cloque crepe,
Carlyne Blencowe has just had her first
book. Hill Top Farm, published. Two
others, Circus and Pantomime, are due
for publication early next year. The idea
of writing and drawing for children has
been with Carlyne since her schooldays
at St. Catherine’s. During the war she
drew war-maps for a Melbourne news-
paper, and later traced for the Direc-
torate of Explosives. Besides being a
' writer and artist, Carlyne is an accom-
plished pianiste. Photo, from Allan
Studios.
The engagement has been announced
of Veronica, youngest daughter of Lady
Syme and the late Sir Geoffrey Syme, of
Blythswood, Kew, and Peter Stapleton,
only son of Mr. and Mrs. W. P. Condon,
of Kew. Veronica, who returned from a
Irip to England some weeks ago, will
celebrate her coming-of-age early in the
new year. Wedding-bells are expected to
ring about the middle of the year.
White slipper-satin with pearl em-
broideries on the collar, belt and sleeves
was worn by Helen Marjorie, only
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. W. Dunstan,
of Toorak, when she was married at St.
John’s, Toorak. The finger-tip veil of
tulle was held by a chaplet of orange-
blossom buds, and her bouquet was of
gardenias and stephanotis. Bridesmaids
Mary Randall and Marie McFadyen wore
picture-frocks of lime-green moire and
wide-brimmed green crinoline straw hats.
The bridegroom, Peter Graeme, son of
Mrs. G. Pardey, of Darling Point,
Sydney, and the late Mr. P. A. Mcjntosh,

the bride’s brother Bill Dunstan as
groomsman. The reception was held at
the home of Mr. and Mrs. Dunstan.
Phyllis Robins, an English comedienne,
is one of the stars in the current Tivoli
show. Her gown of white chiffon, with
its wide bouffant skirt, strapless bodice
and flowing shoulder scarf created great
interest. The ballet wear some lovely
creations; the most striking were the
short, full-skirted white satins trimmed
with pastel-pink roses and rose-trimmed,
white poke bonnets. First-night audience
included Mrs. E, Johnstone, whose
corduroy velvet jacket-suit was in cinna-
mon tones; Mrs. Lance Rigg, in black
with a small feathered hat, and Mes-
dames S. Aarons, Norman Lynch’ and
Royden Honeyman.
Following American tradition, a large
holly wreath was centred on the door of
their Toorak home, and in the entrance
hall was a gaily-festooned Christmas-tree,
when the Harold Rablings entertained at
a late-afternoon party. Mrs. Rabling re-
ceived her guests in a white silk frock
patterned in tiny holly flowers. Lady

her black frock. A wide-brimmed black
hat was apt accessory for Kathleen
Gepp’s simple, tailored black frock. Mrs.
Wesley Ince wore a floral frock and black
hat.
A big crWd at the Princess Theatre
greeted Denise Porritt, winner of the Miss
Victoria section of the Miss Australia
quest. Representatives of the Red Cross,
the organisation which will benefit
greatly from the proceeds of the quest,
included Sir Newman and Lady Morris,
Col. and Mrs. Allan Spowers and Mrs.
Eccles McKay. Also in the official party
were Mr. and Mrs. W. H. McKechnie
(he is chairman of the Board of Direc-
tors of the Quest), Mr. and Mrs. Garnet
Carroll and Mr. and Mrs. Frank Martin,
The Lady Mayoress, Mrs. J. S. Disney,
wearing a slimly-cut grey crepe gown and
matching jacket, presented the sash and
placed the crown of victory on the head
of the winner. Denise’s gown was of
golden-brown taffeta. Joan Potter, the
runner-up, wore a lovely white net frock
which had a bouffant skirt; Helen Lon-
don, in a gown of pastel-pink satin, won
the prize for raising over £3OOO. Appro-
priately, she was sponsored by the Red
Cross Blood Transfusion Service. All 53
candidates were later entertained at
Giro’s.
Gay informality was the keynote of
the party given by Mrs. Herbert Brookes,
president of the International Club, at
her home, Winwick, South Yarra. Guests
joined in singing Christmas carols; at
afternoon tea, national food prepared by
members of the club was served. Among
the guests were the Consul for Greece,
Andrew Nicolades, and his wife, the latter
wearing a black tailored coat and small
double-brimmed white straw hat swathed
in black tulle. The wife of the Czecho-
slovakian Consul, Mrs. Edgar Peacock,
was smart in black-and-white floral and
black tulle-trimmed hat. Wife of the
Netherlands Trade Commissioner, Mrs.
J. van Noordan, added to her American
Beauty crepe frock a small white hat.
Mrs. A. W. Foster trimmed her navy frock
with red-and-white-spotted silk ; her black
straw hat had black satin bows. Madame
Martin Wang, wife of the Chinese
Consul, wore a national costume of soft-
blue satin patterned in deeper blue. Mrs.
C. Borhaven had flower posies in the
small black hat she wore with her black
tailored suit. Madame P. Fornari's
coral-pink-and-white-patterned frock was
worn with a toast-toned straw hat. Mrs.
Bernard Heinze’s florals were in deep
mauve tonings. Kathleen Lascelles s
frock and silk hat were black. Mrs. G. H.
Hargrave, secretary of the club, was in
aqua-blue crepes; her sister, Susan Hay-
ward Young, had touches of white in her
black ensemble and small hat.
A snap-back into winter made race-
goers at the Moonee Valley charity
meeting retrieve tweeds and woollens
from among the naphthalene. Wife of the
secretary to the M.V.R.C., Mrs. W. S.
Cox, was in blue-and-white-patterned
silk, but added for warmth a finger-tip
elephant-breath velveteen coat; her off-

Mrs.- K. Ellis’s grey suit had a pleated
skirt; her sailor hat was of grey felt.
Dawn Greville added a tiny grey bowler
to her grey suit. A brown suit and brown

ribbon was worn by Mrs. T. Street,
A silvenwedding anniversary buffet-
dinner was given by the celebrants, Mr.
and Mrs. Ken Hooper, of Point Cook, in
the Gowrie-room at Menzies. Mrs.
Hooper’s small white hat with its trail of
white, black and deep-red flowers was
worn with a black satin cloque frock.
Mrs. J. E. Shilliday’s black off-the-face
hat had a swirl of cocq feathers. Pink
roses nestled in black tulle on the hat
worn by Mrs. W. G. Horsfall with her
black frock and kolinsky-fur cape.
Lillian Wightman’s grey chiffon hat was
of the Gibson-girl type. Upstanding
ospreys trimmed the small beige-toned
boater hat worn by Mrs. Lionel Newton
with a full-skirted black crepe frock. A
wide-brimmed, veiled, natural-straw hat
and Parma-violet-patterned white frock
were the choice of Mrs. J. McGrath.
Tulle swathed the crown of the fine-straw
black hat Mrs. Tim Jones wore with her
black frock. A blue felt tricorne made
alluring alliance with Mrs. M. Tompkins’s
black Edwardian faille frock.

Despite increased production and a lift
in the export price of metals, the board
figured last term’s profit £110,251 short
of the previous year’s at £516,842. This
is reconciled with the figure in the table
in this way:
1948.

The net addition to the depreciation re-
serve (making it £3,901,029, or 70.3 p.c.
of book-value of plant, etc.) is included
with profit and then shown as written off.
The £566,822 (down £111,266) that re-
mained was 1&9 p.c. on the £3,000,000 of
share capital (half of it cumulative parti-
cipating) as against 22,5, 13.5, 11.6, 10.5,
10.5 and 12.4 p.c. back to 1942. The div.
was lowered from \l\ p.c.' to 15 p.c.,
making the average over the last eight
years 11.7 p.c., compared with an average
of 14.3 p.c. for the preceding quinquen-
nium and 1.8 p.c. for the five years be-
fore that.
The slip in earnings was due to (1) the
greater proportion of zinc sold locally
at the unprofitable fixed price of £22 per
ton, and (2) increased costs. Total
quantity of zinc produced and the amount
consumed locally compare as follows;

1947 .. 70,314 36,150 51.4
1948 ~ 75,896 48,225 63.9
Of the 1948 production 73,900 tons was
• sold, 65 p.c. of it locally, and the balance
overseas at an average of £7B a ton as
against an average of £63 in the previous
term. The Australian equivalent of the
current London price of electrolytic is
£132 10s. a ton. But local appetite for
the metal is still growing, and the decision
of the States’ price-fixing authorities to
keep the local selling figure at £22 a ton,
which is below cost of production, will
rob shareholders of most of the benefit
of buoyant world prices under the exist-*
ing clumsy set-up. Failing satisfactory
adjustment of this, the co. has decided
to cut in half its supply of zinc to the
local market from the beginning of 1949.
The question is fully discussed elsewhere
on these pages.
The big zinc and residue plant at
Risdon (Tas.) worked to only 86 p.c.

Last term’s figures would have been better
still but for transport difficulties which
affected the flow of concentrates from the
mines to the roasters, and of calcines from
the roasters to the smelter. The year’s
output also included 33,951 tons (up
2094 tons) superphosphate, 90,856 tons
(up 3590 tons) sulphuric acid, 2524 tons
die-casting alloy, and smaller quantities
of zinc dust, zinc sulphate and cobalt
oxide.
At the co.’s own mines at Rosebery
(Tas.) the mill treated 125,226 tons ore,
assaying 19.5 p.c. zinc, for the following
output of concentrates:

In addition 115,127 tons zinc concentrates,
assaying 51.3 p.c. zinc, was bought from
the North and South cos. at the Barrier,
Ore blocked at Rosebery remains un-
changed at 1,500,000 tons of > average
grade ; but the drill has disclosed further
extension of the ore-bodies.
At Risdon extensions to the zinc plant
(raising capacity to 100,000 tons zinc
p.a.) and the first flash-roaster and first
section of the new contact acid plant are
nearing completion. Preliminaries in
connection with the sulphate-of-ammonia
project are under way, and attention is
being given to installation of a third zinc-
smelting furnace. Shareholders aren’t
likely to be asked to assist for some time,
if at all;

The sharemarket, mindful of the co.’s
excellent history, and with one eye on
overseas metal prices and the other on
expanding activities, expects the 15 p.c.
div. to be maintained. It therefore prices
the prefs. at 745. 6d. and the ords. at
735. 6d., giving a return of a shade over

This big industrial group—parent and*
33 subsidiary and associated cos. scattered
throughout Australia, New Zealand and
S. Africa —is a self-supporting comple-
mentary organisation turning out felt
piece-goods, footwear, carpets, dress
cloths, knitted goods, men’s suits, and
wool-tops and yarns, etc. Continued all-
round expansion is the keynote of. the
accounts.
TJiree new businesses were absorbed
last term at a cost of £221,893 in f.-p. £1
ords. —112,126 for 125,000 ords. in
Korma Textiles (N.Z.), Ltd. (Auckland),
84,927 for all the ord. capital in the
Adelaide wool-scouring firm of J. W.
McGregor and Sons, and 24,840 for the
business of J. J. Davies and Co. Then, to
ease pressure of current debt and help
finance expanding activities, 1,260,000
new £1 4 p.c. third prefs. were issued at
par in March , last —over 41 p.c. of the
issue was left with the underwriters. All
this raised paid capital to £3,294,783 in
40.000 first 6 p.c., 200,000 second 6 p.c.
and 1,260,000 third 4 p.c. cum. prefs. and
1,794,783 ords. Increase in the total
figure since 1936 has been £3,174,853, of
which the public put up £2,612,165, bonus
scrip accounted for £135,500, the balance
being issued in payment, or part-payment,
for subsidiary or associated interests.
The public also put up £1,000,000 of 4 p.c.
20-year debenture money in 1946.
Most important of last term’s acquisi-
tions was the Korma co., which turns out
knitted woollen-goods from yarns now
supplied mostly by Felt and Textiles
N.Z., Ltd., and aims at presently supply-
ing the bulk of the Dominion’s require-
ments of this class of merchandise. Since
taken over this offshoot has issued
125.000 new 5 p.c. prefs. and 625,000 new
ords., raising paid capital to £1,000,000 in
250.000 5 p.c. prefs. and 750,000 ords.
The prefs. are held by the public and
most of the ords. by the parent. To help
pay for Korma scrip the parent sold
privately (below then current market
price) part of its holding in Felt and
Textiles N.Z., Ltd., in which it still owns
a controlling interest. There was a capital
profit on this deal of £149,208, which, to-
gether with a net capital gain of £8677
from other sources, was added to reserves.
They also benefited by £30,000 overpro-
vision for taxation in 1947, and were
charged with £51,252 expenses connected
with the issue of third prefs.
To what extent appreciation of the N.Z.
pound to par with sterling in August last
will affect the parent’s" interests in the
Dominion is difficult to say at the
moment. In one direction the result will
be similar to removal of a 25 p.c. tariff
protection. Cost .of plant and other
materials imported will be reduced, but
value of some stock on hand when the
exchange rate was altered will be
adversely affected. The Dominion’s
Socialist Government says it will protect
local industries through import-control—
a fluid base on which to plan business ex-
pansion. Korma won’t get into full swing
for another year or so. Meanwhile, much
depends upon how stubborn costs prove
to be.
Overall trading result for year to June
30 last of Felt and Textiles of South
Africa (issued capital £1,000,000), in
which this Australian co. holds a 40 p.c.
interest, were “disappointing.” The co.,
which paid 8 p.c. in the previous year,
has expanded very rapidly. The old-
established part of the business “operated
at a satisfactory profit,” and conditions
generally have recently improved.
In Australia, where the parent’s major
interests are, there was an all-round in-
crease in turnover. After allowing
£328,820 (up £74,581) for depreciation,
£520,940 (up £226,805) for taxation and
getting aside a further £160,000 against
possible fluctuations in the price of wool
and other stocks, aggregate net earnings
of the group (excluding the S. African co.)
were £47,767 stronger at £374,340. That
covered first and second pref. divs. and
20 p.c. on ord. capital as against 22.6,
17.8, 14.8, 16.4, 14.4, 16.3 and 13.6 p.c.
back to 1941. Allowing a full year’s div,
for the third prefs. enough remained to
show 16.3 p.c. on ord. capital. The div.
was kept at 12j- p.c.; it had been steady
at lO' p.c. for the decade to June, 1946.
Besides the £1,481,893 added to paid
capital, the board ‘went outside (mostly
to the bank) for an extra £1,339,355 last
term; —•

L. J. Hooker, Ltd. (Sydney)
In its first year as a public company
this Sydney estate - agency business
widened its scope and reported a
substantial rise in net profits. An eighth
suburban branch was secured in the
former business of E. J. Egan at Bondi
Junction continuing the company’s
policy of confining its sub-branches to
the eastern suburbs of Sydney—and the
purchase consideration of 3000 £1
ordinary shares makes this, in the chair-
man’s view, a “most advantageous” deal.
Moreover, nearly £16,000 was invested
during the year in a new subsidiary con-
centrating on “real-estate development” ;
it advises and actively assists in building
projects for housing or other purposes—
securing the land, if necessary, on behalf
of clients, supervising the building and
finally selling the completed homes for
the owners. “We have already proved
this to be a profitable field of invest-
ment,” says the board, “with marked
collateral advantages to our overall trad-
ing operations.”
In its basic activity of property-manage-
ment, L. J. Hooker now collects rents
totalling £640,000 annually. (The rent-
portfolio is given a goodwill-value of
£45,178 in the books.) In real-estate sales
the co. has headed the list for some
time in Sydney; last year’s turnover was
£2,592,000, and for 1948 “a good report is
already in prospect.”
A small reduction in gcpss profit last
term was more than offset by a saving
of £3675 in all expenses, including tax.
The net figure was. £2793 higher and, after
paying pref. dividends, represented 19.8
p.c. on average ordinary capital, com-
pared with 11.1 p.c. the previous year:

capital to £76,209.

were revalued and a resulting surplus of
£27,239 added to reserves:

Official Bungling
The decision of Electrolytic
Zinc Co., only producer of zinc
in Australia, to cut in half its
supply of the metal for local
consumption from the begin-
ning of 1949 should help to
bring State Prices Ministers to
their senses. If it doesn’t,
responsibility for the serious dis-
location that will follow in the
building and many other indus-
tries will rest squarely on their
shoulders.
The Ministers’ declaration
that the local selling - price
of both lead and zinc would
be maintained at the un-
just price of £22 a ton —it is far
below present cost of produc-
tion —while at the same time
evading their obvious responsi-
bility in connection with the de-
livery and price of zinc concen-
trates, without which the metal
cannot be produced, left the cp.
no reasonable alternative but
to do as it has done.
Full details of the co.’s earn- .
ings, production, sale of metals
and price obtained for zinc, etc.,
are given in a review of its ac-
counts elsewhere on these pages.
The Federal Government first
fixed the price of zinc at £22 a
ton in February, 1940. Al-
though costs and overseas metal
prices have both rocketed since
the war, the local selling-price
has been stubbornly maintained
at the 1940 level. Chief reason
for this is the naive socialistic
notion that no justification to
increase the price exists while
the co. continues to make a rea-
sonable overall profit.
But this is by no means
the whole story. As E.Z.’s
chairman recently pointed out,
certain producers of zinc
concentrates have been per-
mitted to export the whole
of their output, thus reaping the
full benefit of high overseas
prices, while others have made
available a substantial portion
of their production at less than
cost to meet Australia’s rapidly-
growing requirements. Since the
beginning of 1948 three cos.
alone —North 8.H., B.H. South
and E.Z, —have borne the whole
of the burden. Together they
produce less than half the total
zinc concentrate output of Aus-
tralia. It costs more than £22
to freight the concentrate from
the mines to Risdon and turn
out a ton of zinc. Obviously,
the three cos, mentioned have
behaved in a generous and pub-
lic-spirited manner i they have
produced that portion of their
zinc concentrates used for local
consumption at a dead loss.
Through official schizophrenia
the whole question has come to
smell strongly of injustice and
discrimination. Solution of the
problem calls for a little com-
’ monsense and the ending of
doctrinaire nonsense. If Gov-
ernment is intent upon giving
Australian consumers cheap
zinc, then the just price is one
that covers cost of production,
plus a moderate profit. And
fairness demands that Govern-
ment should make it obligatory
upon all producers of zinc con-
centrates to contribute equitably
to the pool.
Renison Associated Tin (Tas.)
is giving its shareholders a
Christmas-box of sixpence per
share, being 12£ p.c. on capital.
The mine is looking well, and
occasional splashes of rich ore
keep shareholders on their toes,
with the prospect of Mt. Bischoff
history repeating itself by the
disclosure of a rich core on
mother lode to account for the
tin content of its extensive ore-
bodies. Mill practice is to be
improved by substitution of rolls
for stamps in the crushing sec-
tion and the addition of six
more Wilfleys and a slime-table
to the concentrating plant. With
the throughput thus doubled,
Renison stands a good chance
of fulfilling the promise of a
bright future which these exten-
sive sulphide-ore bodies have
always given.

Sunshine Gold Development,
which has begun sluicing its
claims on the Watut River (New
Guinea) again, is to work part
of the adjoining Widobosh ter-
races belonging to Bulolo on a
mutual profit-sharing basis.

area of about 1050 acres in 1932
for £4OOO (cash) from the Wido-
bosh syndicate and C. and D. R.

“Bullionist”: Westralian
Chamber of Mines still pleads
with Prime Minister Chifley for
assistance for goldmining. It
states that, unlike wool, gold,
except on one occasion, has over-
come past difficulties without
Government aid. It adds that,
unless some form of bonus on
production is granted, ever-ris-
ing costs will progressively
strangle the industry. The chair-
man of one Westralian co, says
that in 1939 production cost
for the State’s main goldmines
was £6 9s. 9d. a fine oz.; in
August, 1948, the figure had
reached £9 16s. lOd. and is still
on the up-grade. The new
Arbitration Court award added
11s. an oz. to costs, while the
40-hour week increased the load
by another Bs. 7d., and the re-
cent rise in railway freights will
add a bit more to the burden.
If full-employment, or anything
approaching it, is to be main-
tained in the industry it is con-
sidered that temporary assistance
equal to £2 10s.- an oz. on pro-
duction would not be too much.

SUNDRY SHOWS
"Measure for
Measure."
“Measure for Measure,” cur-
rently showing at the Indepen-
dent Theatre, North Sydney
(every Wednesday at 8.15 p.m.),
is one of those Shakspearian
plays which practically everyone
has read and which few people
have seen animated on the
boards: indeed, according to
the producer’s note, it hasn’t
been played in Sydney for over
20 years.
This, perhaps, is not alto-
gether dn unmixed evil. It is
better for Shakspeare not to be
played at all than for his work
to be mangled, as it has been
in some local productions. There
is no point in presenting expur-
gated Shakspeare, or a Shak-
spearian play which is used only
as a device to display the
talents of budding young
suburban Thespians.
This criticism in nowise
applies to the Independent
Group, which has given un-
wearied service to the theatre,
to May Hollinworth’s Metro-
politan Theatre, or to several of
the “Little Theatre” group.
But it is some indication of the
difficulties of a producer. At
North Sydney, producer John
Alden has done a sound and
sympathetic job. Shakspeare’s
poetry and his drama come out
simply and clearly, and, apart
from the poetry and the atmos-
phere of corruption and bad
conscience which are the prevail-
ing impressions of the play as
read, there is something else
which really comes to life only
on the living stage: the rich
and profound comedy of the
bawds, Pompey and Mistress
Overdone, and the fantastic
character of Lucio, a sort of
tavern knight.
These characters give a live-
liness and a contrast to the
tragedy of Angelo, the spectacle
of his tormented conscience and
later villainy and the whole
pageant of corruption and the
abuse of power. At the same
time, by exaggeration, they high-
light the purity of Isabella, sister
of Claudio, who has been con-
demned to death by Angelo,
deputy to Vincentio, Duke of
Vienna, in his absence, under
the morality laws long in abey-
ance. Angelo, tempted by Isa-
bella’s beauty, agrees to reprieve
Claudio only at the sacrifice of
Isabella herself: and the rather
melodramatic ‘uncoiling of his
schemes, and their frustration by
Isabella, aided by the Duke dis-
guised as a friar, and the uni-
formly happy sequel, with all
ill-doers pardoned and every-
one reformed belongs, properly,
to the convention of the Eliza-
bethan stage.
But the drama of character —
of temptation and remorse—is
Shakspeare’s, as is the poetry.
John Alden played the part of
Angelo and gave him a kind of
fiery grace and tormented
strength altogether an out-
standing performance. Alfred
Bristowe, as Claudio, the young
nobleman who had been con-
demned to death for getting his
betrothed, Mariana, with child,
was suitably handsome, lively
and vigorous in an unexacting
role: the dramatic moment
came when he pleaded with his
sister in his cell, and then he
was a shade too shrill.
Leonard Bullen as Vincentio,
the Duke, was unsatisfactory,
making his speeches as though
they were pieces of verse—which
they were —but losing the poetry
of living speech. Dorothy Ali-
son, as Isabella, was splendid,
bringing to the part grace and
delicacy and a passion of fear
and despair.
But amid all the changing
characters and changes of pur-
pose—-Angelo, from puritan to
villain, and then to a repentant
man who is pardoned by the
Duke and ‘who marries his
slighted betrothed; Isabella,
from a novice in a convent to
a central dynamic character and
then, in the'happy end, to the
affianced of the Duke; and the
changes in the shadowy and
majestic personality of the Duke
himself —the bawds remain con-
stant, realistic, comic and earthy.
Part of Shakspeare’s universal
view of life, his gusto and his
fidelity, they remain bawds.
Len London takes the part of
Pompey, Laurel Streeter that of
Mistress Overdone, and Barbara
Duval is a third, a Townsgirl.
All performances were excel-
lent, although what the censor-
ing authorities would think of
them if Shakspeare were a con-
temporary Sydney playwright is
another matter.
"Rigoletto."
Only three years short of its
centenary, “Rigoletto” still has
the power to hold its audience,
despite its Grand Guignol story.
The reasons are twofold: the
three ever-living arias—four, if
the quartet in the third act be
included—which shine out from
the rich background of Verdi
music, and the pathos a good
artist can put into the part of
the hunchback jester. With a
or a Caruso in the cast
the emphasis would be on the
former; an audience would
carry away as a mind-picture
of the opera Gilda’s “Caro
nome” or the Duke’s carefree
“Questa o quella” or “La donna
e mobile.” When the work is
performed by a company of an
even calibre falling short of
greatness, such as the one at pre-
sent reminding Sydney Tivoli
that it used to be known as the
Opera House, it is the second
feature that is emphasised.
Saturday night’s audience will
remember this performance of
“Rigoletto” for Rigoletto him-
self, as portrayed by Mario
Basiola.
In medieval times a hunch-
back was an object for both
laughter and fear. His mis-
shapen form tickled a coarse
sense of humor and superstition,
with roots in forgotten
mythology, made of him the
embodiment of malignant
cunning. , This treatment must
often have induced in the victim
the very quality it deemed to be
already in his character. If one
of these unfortunates became
a court jester licence and the
protection of his lord permitted
him to make the courtiers the
butt for his humor, gaining
thereby some satisfaction for
the prank Nature had played on
his body, but laying up for him-
self a real score of hatred and
enmity.
Such a one was Rigo-
letto, and from his first entrance
Basiola made clear his position
in the court. Hated, feared and
despised, he was an emblem of
malevolence, yet almost from
the start he inspired pity. Long
before the old pander was
tricked into assisting in the
abduction of his own daughter
for the delight of his master he
had made this the dominating
note and he did not step out of
character even for curtain-calls.
Tenor Alvino Misciano, who
handled his songs as lightly as
his amours, was a personable
Duke; his raiment made first-
nighters look shabby. Dora
Minarchi was a vivacious and
tuneful Maddelina; Rina Mari-
osa, as Gilda, was more at home
playing a loving daughter than
in soaring aloft among the trills,
and an assassin who looks after
his weapons as lovingly as
Augusto Romani deserves all
the success his profession can
offer.
Two Australian Works.
At Sydney’s Independent last
week conductor Alan Bellhouse
piloted the North Shore Sym-
phony/ Orchestra and Choral
Society through two new works
by Australian composers:
Dulcie Holland’s cantata “The
Circle of the Year” and Frank
Hutchens’s “North-east Wind.”
Set in six parts, Miss Holland’s
work is well-knit, at times richly
sonorous, kept well on the move,
logical as to structure and has
some fine work for the wood-
winds in the strong orchestral
background. The second move-
ment is particularly telling, with
a good rhythmic swing. The
last movement is studded with
many choral difficulties, but the
choir braved them well, though
it could do with more weight in
the tenors.
Frank Hutchens’s work is
shorter, but packed with
dynamics. This composer, who
is turning out works of good
quality, can say more in one
measure than most composers
can say in two. He obviously
has no use for “padding,” and
he argues from sound themes.
“North-east Wind” doesn’t’
exactly overemphasise melody,
but the orchestration is clever
and convincing.
The earthy flavor of Bach’s
“Peasant Cantata” was given its
due in choruses that were full-
blooded and strongly unified in
their “attack.” The same com-
poser’s “Sheep May Safely
Graze” and “Jesu, Joy of Man’s
Desiring” wound up a
thoroughly satisfying night.
"Golden Boy."
There must be something in
Clifford Odets’s “Golden Boy”
which appeals to Leftists and
which escapes detection by or-
dinary mortals. For there is no
humanity in the play, and none
of the characters are like human
beings. The observation, if any,
is superficial, like a busy journa-
list’s report of a police-court
case. It is as difficult to identify
oneself with the young man,
with some strong traces of
sadism in his composition, who
wants to become a professional
pug on the one hand and a great
violinist on the other, as it is
with the girl who falls in love
with him because he belts her.
That he can’t convince any-
body that he is an incipient
Wagner is not surprising, and
when he kills his opponent in a
fistic encounter and kills himself
and the girl in a motor-car smash
one feels no particular regret.
The shallowness of the observa-
tion of crooks, match-pro-
moters and assorted sharks
makes the play difficult of en-
durance ; and this general
mediocrity and shallowness is
emphasised, as it were, in the
presentation by the Tin Alley
Players at the Union Theatre,
University of Melbourne.
After two and a half hours
of their snarling, growling and
barking in curious imitations of
the American accent it was
difficult not to detest the play
and to think slightingly of the
playwright. Yet Clifford Odets
has a reputation for bringing
new life and richness to the
theatre.
One touch of feeling was pro-.'
vided by Les Young, whose soft-
voiced anguish and devotion to
his allegedly gifted son was ad-
mirably rendered, but the rest
of the cast were caricatures of
human beings, especially Profes-
sor Keith Macartney, who had
apparently come to the conclu-
sion that his part of a sardonic
Italian entrepreneur was the
most important in the play and
worked it for all it was worth
as if it was Hamlet.
Mr. Odets gives the impres-
sion that he has got his ideas on
life out of a book and written
his play to a theory. It doesn’t
sound so much like his own ex-
perience as somebody else’s.
There is a bit of love in the
savage business, but it is so senti-
mental that it put one’s teeth on
edge to listen to it. However,
there were times and places
where George Fairfax, as the
bruiser - violinist, did reveal
some of the misery and despair
of his mixed character.
Nativity Play.
As a Christmas spectacle the
Chester Nativity Play, put on
by the Genesian Players at the
Manresa Hall, North Sydney, is
appropriate. As a medieval
period piece, it is inaccurate —
altogether too modern and
polished and a little stilted.
Allowing for these deficiencies,
the effect is pleasing. Artistry,
of a kind which might appear
incongruous to an audience of
guildsmen and burghers, makes
the scenes palatable to a Sydney
audience. There is a gracious
warmth in the play itself; and
if the choral singing is modern,
at least it rings pleasantly in the
ear.
What is lacking is something
of the robust humor of the
Middle Ages, coupled with a

John Glover revolutionized the commercial manu-
facture of sulphuric acid. Next to water, sulphuric acid
is the most important of all chemicals. Its use is so wide-
spread that the volume of its production is often taken as
a barometer of general industrial activity. In 1859 Glover
built the first of the “Glover Towers,” now such a familiar
feature of the chemical works of Lancashire. He declined
to take out a patent for his invention and was always ready
to show visitors and even competitors how it worked.
Born at Wallsend, near Newcastle-on-Tyne, in 1817. John
Glover was apprenticed to a plumber, but studied chemistry
at the local Mechanics Institute to such effect that he
secured the post of junior chemist in a Tyneside chemical
works. There he invented an improved method of manu-
facturing alum, and at the age of twenty-five became
manager of a works making sulphuric acid, hydrochloric
acid and magnesium carbonate. While thus employed, he
thought out and constructed the first of his towers. In 1861
he became a partner in the Carville Chemical Works, where
he remained until his retirement in 1882.
Hundreds of Glover Towers, helping to make
thousands of tons of sulphuric acid, stand
all over the world as a monument to the
inventive genius of John Glover, British
chemical manufacturer.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM
Sydney weather is capable of some
very weird performances and usually
reserves the fanciest of these for
Saturdays Saturday afternoons m
particular. Wending their way to
Randwick for the Villiers, racegoers
■were faced with a pleasantly warm,
summery day. The temperature when
the first race was run stood round
the 78 mark; within an hour it had
soared to 93 and continued above
that mark for the remainder of the
afternoon. In the evening, however,
a sudden switch in the wind brought
the mercury tumbling down 30 points
in as many minutes; toasted, battered,
stewed and chilled was the punter s
fare for the day.
The Villiers attracted a good-
quality field, and the final betting
was 7 to 1 bar one, with Filipino
favorite at threes. The Westralian-
owned Filipino was also the handi-
capper’s pick for the race, carrying
topweight of 9.4, and was jockey
J. Thompson’s choice of the half-
dozen mounts offered him in the
Villiers. Thompson won the race
last year on Barnsley.
Filipino proved a worthy topweight
and a worthy favorite. He was favor-
ably drawn in number three position
at the barrier and was the first to
break out from the stalls. Thompson
quickly obtained a good position in
fourth place with Mine Host setting
the pace, gave his mount the run of
the race and won in handsome style.
The Diver and Blue Ensign both
finished strongly from the rear of
the field to fill second and third
places respectively, and _ the consis-
tent three-year-old Cragside also ran
an excellent race. The margins were
one length and a neck, while the time,
1.371, was the best recorded in the
Villiers,since Yaralla scored in similar
time in 1941.
The complete disappointment
among the Villiers runners was the
well - backed and much - publicised
Slander, who scarcely raised a gallop
and beat only four or five home.
Equal second favorite with Slander,
Frescano made a bit of a dash in
the straight but quickly faded out.
Mine Host showed his usual speed,
but, like most of Ajax’s get, seems to
lack the stamina to win at a mile
in good company. Barnsley, whose
preference is for softish going, at no
stage looked the winner.
Trained by F. McGrath for Drs.
S. O’Neill and T. Early, Filipino is
a five-year-old bay horse by Double
Remove-True Mettle. In some of
his races he has shown weakness when
challenged in tight finishes, but on
Saturday won like a truly good horse.
As the record-book shows, the Vil-
liers is not a race for topweights.
Other than Filipino, Bemborough
with 9.2 in 1945 and Closing Time
with 9.5 in 1933 are the only horses
that have won the Villiers with more
than 8.11 in the past quarter-century.
The success of Filipino was loudly
bemoaned by the bookmakers, some
of whom appear to find a ready
market for their wailing. Their losses,
we are told, were colossal. One pad-
dock bagman was reported to have
paid out more than £lB,OOO. So he
may have; but it would be more to
the point to know how much he
was holding. Unless present writer s
notions of bookmaking are all at
sea, the success of one real rough un
at Randwick would net any mtelli-
gent bookmaker more than he would
lose on half a dozen Filipinos.
The only other favorite successful
on Saturday was the Golden Sovereign
colt King’s Coin (W. Cook) winning
the December Juvenile and completing
a double for trainer F. C. Allsop.
Earlier Allsop had taken the Decem-
ber Nursery for two-year-old fillies
with Lonely (J. Lordan), a handsome
chestnut daughter of Ajax-Aulone
and a full-sister to the speedy Civic
Pride. Placegetters in the Nursery
were The Duchess and Dixie Belle,
while Chitral and Nerscot finished
closest to King’s Coin.
Since he first tasted success as a
trainer with his old meal-tickets
Shining Night and Kiaree, Maurice
McCarten has always shown particu-
lar ability in the preparation and
placing of stayers and middle-distance
“Better try your blaster , Sir.”
gallopers. Of late this ability has
been not much appreciated by the
crowd. Following on Herbert River s
unpopular win at Rosehill the pre-
vious week, Lysander (N. Sellwood)
was also hooted home when he won
Saturday’s 10-furlongs December
Handicap. Lysander had shaped dis-
appointingly in recent races, but Mc-
Carten could scarcely be blamed for
the fall which spoiled the chances of
some of the more fancied runners
in the December Handicap.
Running at the time fourth in the
field of 13, High Ideals came a nasty
cropper at the top of the straight;
his apprentice rider, R. Pearse, was
extremely lucky to escape with a
bruising. The field was thrown into
disorder, and Lysander, who had
missed the bother, went on to win
from Gay Fault and Avalanche.
None of Saturday’s runners im-
pressed as likely to win the Summer
Cup, but that race has been won in
the past by some very poor, or at
least little-fancied, horses, including
maidens. Indeed, over the past 25
years only one horse carrying 9st.
or over has been so much as placed
in the Cup. That was Silver Link,
who had 9st. when second to the
maiden Haxton in 1946; Silver Link
this year has 9.2, and, on his day,
would take a spot of beating. Bolivia,
however, with 7.7 should go close
to winning.
Although winning favorites were
not abundant at Randwick, most win-
ners were at shortish odds, the longest
being Lysander and Lonely, both at
7 to 1. The High Caste colt High
Welcome (G. Moore) started at threes
in the Three-year-old Handicap to
score his fourth successive win; he
beat Admetus by the barest nose.
Admetus, who was favorite, is pre-
pared by former jockey Ted Mc-
Menamin, having a stiff trot in his
attempt to crack the ice as a trainer.
* * * . *
Attendance at Moonee Valley on
Saturday was well below average. The
weather, admittedly, was not good,
but it is noticeable that charity meet-
ings are nearly always poorly attended.
Saturday’s fixture was in aid of metro-
politan and country hospitals.
An impressive winner was the
Dhoti filly Charkha, taking the second
division of the Juvenile Plate—her
second win from her only starts.
Charkha gave J. Purtell an armchair
ride, jumping into the lead at barner-
rise and running on well to beat Bon
Ali by 2i lengths. Charkha started
at even money and gave her backers
not the least anxiety, but they were,
nevertheless, lucky to collect. A
twisted plate, which would have
ruined Charkha’s chance, was dis-
covered just as the filly was leaving
the weighing enclosure.
In both divisions of the Juvenile,
fillies proved too good for the colts.
The first division went to Vels, a
very diminutive daughter of Tudor
King. Vels got away badly, but
Purtell had worked her up to a handv
position approaching the turn, and,
hard ridden, she defeated the favorite,
Voussoir, by a half-head.
In winning the 13-furlongs Hospital
Handicap, the aged Solar Bear horse
Antares (T. Unkovich) displayed
much-improved form* A fortnight
previously at Caulfield he had finished
dead last in a shorter race. On
Saturday, however, he was never
farther back than second, trailing
the pacemaker Deen Devon. Three
furlongs from home Antares zipped
away from the field and went on to
comfortably defeat other lightweights
in Del Rose and Miss Prim.
The crowd accepted with resig-
nation the success of Antares at
20 to 1, but burst into vociferous
disapproval after Mentmore (L. Lott)
at 8 to 1 had beaten Laimell and
Denhoti in the six-furlongs Nurses’
Handicap. The former Sydney gal-
loper Tamaroa started a hot favorite
for the Nurses’ Handicap, evidently
on the strength of some rumored
secret gallops during the week; his
performance suggested that he was
among those not in on the secret.
Not previously successful in Mel-
bourne, nor in Sydney, where he con- ,
tested Mixed Stakes events for a
while, the Dhoti colt Alabama King
(G. Bougoure) broke the ice with a
rather flukey half-head win from Land
Boy in the mile Parkville Handicap
for three-year-olds. Hie favorite
Damon, had every chance but could
manage only a distant third. Land
Boy' would have won but for being
carried out wide by Damon on the
turn, which allowed Alabama King
to nip through on the rails. Alabama
King is a bay colt by Dhoti from
Miss Devlin, the dam of Don Pedro.
Particularly rough on punters were
two divisions of the Carlton High-
weight, each seeing a 5-to-2 favorite
finish in a minor place. The first
division went to the 33 to 1 chance
Judgment (J. Gilmore) beating Varia-
tion and the favorite, Monte Cassino.
Hie second Highweight was won by
the Nizami gelding Astor (W. Wil-
liamson) just pipping Royglen and
Derfla. A somewhat better result
was that of the Charity Hurdle, with
Marsula (S. Gardiner) winning by
four lengths from Talon, the pair
of them equal favorites at 7 to 2.

For many competitors in the Vic-
torian Rowing -Association’s cham-
pionship regatta on Saturday, a con-
templated day on the river became a
day well and truly in the river; con-
ditions on the Lower Yarra were
middling boisterous. The (intended)
2000-metres sculling race was a literal
washout —all four contestants sunk
in action. The Melbourne crew
started in the lightweight fours with
three opponents but won without
opposition, Mercantile, Richmond and
Banks all submerging en route. The
Championship fours was won by Mer-
cantile, with Melbourne second and
Corio Bay third; the Banks crew
was swimming strongly when last
sighted.

The Lawn Tennis Association is
giving forth a lot of hemming and
hawing on the question of chal-
lenging for the Davis Cup next year.
Hie last tour was a dead loss finan-
cially; a repeat of that effort would
just about see the Association on the
rocks, and in any* case there is the
dollar issue. The reply simple
to both problems is “Why challenge
in the American zone?” Chiefly
responsible for the financial loss and
wastage of dollars on the last tour
were the matches in Cuba and Mexico,
where interest in tennis is about on
par with Australian interest in bull-
fighting. In the European zone there
is a wider interest in tennis, and
there would be a special interest in
a visiting Australian team. In
addition, there would be a great
saving of dollars, the team could com-
pete at Wimbledon, and throughout
would be meeting stronger opposition
than is represented by Cuba, Canada,
Mexico and the like. .However, if
the L.T.A. selectors intend to pursue
the same course as last year, it
would be a sheer waste of cash and
effort to challenge in any zone.

Belatedly giving blessing to Mrs.
Fanny Blankers-Koen’s record of 11
sec. for 80 metres hurdles made in
June last, the International A.A.
Federation has wiped out the only
world’s record claimed at the 1948
Olympic Games. Mrs. 8.-Koen and
Miss M. H. Gardner (Great Britain)
put up 11.2 sec. at the Games, which,
however, will keep its place among
Olympic records.
• * * *
Australians will shortly have a
chance to see Mrs. Blankers-Koen,
after all; the matter of expenses has
been cleared up and the tour approved
by the Netherlands A.A.U. Clearly
the best woman athlete since the hey-
day of Babe Didrikson and probably
better than the American girl in the
field-events department, Mrs. Blankers-
Koen, apart from her four sprinting
successes at the Olympic Games,
holds the world records for women’s
high jump and long jump. Here,
however, she will probably contest
only running events, with Shirley
Strickland her chief opposition.

Sheffield Shield: — .
At Perth the N.S.W. XI wiped
out Westralia (the holders) by an
innings and 19 runs. Chief con-
tributors to .the visitors’ 507 were
Morris (163), Donaldson (104) and
the youthful Burke (76 n. 0.). Wes-
tralia crumpled for 241 and 247,
Lindwall (eight for 124) and F. John-
ston (six for 172) doing the damage.
On the same strip of ground on
Friday, Queensland scratched around
shakily to accumulate 276, but 148
was the best Westralia could manage
in reply, chiefly due to a fine burst
of bowling by Raymer taking five
for 14,
Victoria opened the season at Mel-
bourne with 436 i'. Queensland. The
Bananalanders rendered feeble response
with 285 and 227, after which the
locals easily knocked up the required
79 to win by eight wickets. Hie name
Johnson with its divers spellings must
be a good cricketing monicker; nearly
every Shield match seems to involve
one or two of the fraternity. Best
bowling figures in the Melbourne
match were obtained by Bill Johnston
(six for 117) and I. Johnson (six for
139) for Vic., while L. Johnson
bagged seven for 127 for the oppo-
sition.
At Adelaide bowlers held the stage;
N.S.W. XI were all out for 243 and
S.A. made a desultory 196. F. Noblet
was a great help to S.A., taking five
for 41, while Lindwall and Johnston
took three each for N.S.W.
* * * *
While most of the Shield cricket
was on the dull side, there was some
really lively play at Brisbane, where
the touring English women’s team
met an Australian XI. The Eng-
lish lasses have shown they know
only one way of playing cricket-
to go for a win; and they’re draw-
ing the crowds. Against the Aus-
tralian team they made 244 for four
wickets declared; the locals responded
with 101 and 207 for six wickets
declared. Set 65 runs to get in a
hurry the English girls had 63 on the
board for the loss of five wickets at
stumps—just two runs short of a
deserved win.
* * * *
Though a noble enough bit of
slogging, the 32 runs (five fours and
two sixers) scored off one over by
Sydney grade batsman K. Branz re-
cently fell short of some recorded
efforts. In 1936 at Wells (Eng.)
against Derbyshire, the Somersetshire
player Welland clouted Armstrong’s
bowling for five successive sixers. He
repeated the effort, again at Wells,
in 1938, Frank Woolley being the
victim. Welland, however, only shone
against certain types of trundlers.
Tried .against Australia in the Oval
Test of 1938, he was quickly dis-
posed of by Bill O’Reilly.
* * * *
Middleweights A 1 Smith (10.121)
and Fred Braddick (11.2) furnished
a willing slug-feast at Leichhardt,
with Smith a game winner after
appearing well beaten. Smith went
down for no count in the first and
was dropped well and truly fqr a
count of nine in the fourth; surviving
that close shave, however, he set
to with a will and had Braddick so
badly beaten by the eighth that the
ref. intervened. In the other 12-
rounder, one Jack Dempsey (10.12)
outpointed Jack Smith (11.5),
* * * *
Rushed into his first Australian
fight a bare fortnight after arrival,
French pug Andre Famechon (9.121)
was beaten on points by Archie Kemp
(9.7) at Melbourne Stadium, but made
a favorable impression. Clearly not
properly in trim, the visitor’s apparent
weight advantage of 511 b. was carried
Plainly round the waistline. A busy
type of boxer, Famechon continually
tried to work his way in to close
quarters, but Kemp held him at bay
and landed scores of solid left hooks;
altogether a good, hard, fast scrap.

When Competition Comes
In Australia, under Socialism-
cwm-Communism, and with
Asiatic influences on our way
of life reaching us through “In-
donesia” and other Communist-
revolutionary areas, our rate of
production has been slowed
down to a greater extent than
in the United States or even
Great Britain, which suffered far
more than other English-speak-
ing countries through war
damage. Through Communist-
inspired disruption of essential
industries and essential services
our output of goods, homes, fac-
tory equipment, etc., has fallen
a long way below our real
capacity to produce them,
especially when the greater num-
ber of people now in employ-
ment is considered.
This fall in our productivity
per person has been disguised,
to some extent, by the exchange
rate on London and New York.
Our costs of production appear
to be low, but this is only so be-
cause of artificialities in the rate
of exchange, or through our
price-control system, or through
subsidies, and concealed losses
on public utilities. Costs of
production depend upon output
per person per hour, and at the
present time that output in Aus-
tralia is lower than it has ever
been, though there is little rea-
son why it should not be re-
stored to pre-war levels and later
improved, the 40-hour week not-
withstanding, That is, no rea-
son except that of Communist
obstructionism and trade-union
obstinacy.
Australian wage-earners have
gained political privileges they
never enjoyed before, and they
are entitled to a greater share
of the national production—,
whatever, largely at their will, it
amounts to. Money and credit
policy are more a Government,
and hence a political, matter
than they have ever been, and
the volume of money , and credit
is equated with the need for
keeping “employment” full in a
way never previously seen.
There are “jobs” for all.
Instead of a metallic governor
(formerly gold) of credit volume
we have this political one. The
Canberra Government bases the
volume on the political neces-
sity for keeping payrolls full,
upon its ambitions in the indus-
trial field and in the transport
industry and on demand for
public works (not always calcu-
lated correctly). And so our
economic stability becomes par-
ticularly vulnerable to Com-
munist domination of key trade-
unions, from which “Labor”
Caucus takes its orders.
One result of this political
control of our credit and cur-
rency—with “Labor” in com-
plete control of the Common-
wealth Bank —has been for costs
to rise as labor indiscipline and
Communist disruption has be-
come more pronounced. Costs
are still soaring, and in the
N. S. Wales transport industries
especially there have been stag-
gering increases in fares and
freight rates. Shipping com-
panies are losing heavily on their
coastal traffic in spite of higher-
charges, subsidies having been
mostly removed, A critical costs
situation is arising now largely
because inadequate productivity
has been unmasked by the re-
laxing of price-control and the
abolition of price-subsidies.
One very serious aspect of
this production lag is that we
may find, in the course of a year
or so, that other mqre politically-
sane countries have overcome
production problems and may
have a surplus to sell overseas.
This will affect the whole world
price-structure, and may cause
a setback in prices for raw
materials as well as for manu-
factured goods. It is unlikely
that world-wide overproduction
of goods will come about for
several years at least; but we
must realise that Australia’s in-
dustrial lackadaisicalness has
been economically possible in
many cases only because of the
acute demand for goods created
by the “economics of scarcity.”
Under ordinary competitive
conditions of world trade we
could never carry on while the
tying-up of the coalfields, indus-
tries and transport systems was
something that could be achieved
at the wanton whim of a few
Communist union-bosses.
We must make every endeavor
to get back into step with the
return of productivity that is be-
coming apparent overseas, more
"Just hang on —my secretary's going through the
files now."
-especially in the United States,
the greatest industrial Power on
earth.
There may be countries over-
seas, also, which will adopt a
more resolute line with regard
to the value of money. In Aus-
tralia the political set-up is one
in which, , regardless of rights or
equities, or of the future, infla-
tion will be accepted as an
alternative to any slackening in
employment. Other countries
may take the wiser view that
stability in currency and values
has to be achieved—that the
failure of trade-unionists and
Socialist Governments to rise to
their- responsibilities must be
corrected even in the face of
some unemployment arising
from conditions created by the
unemployed themselves.
The position may thus arise
in which Australia, under a
“Labor” Government, will con-
tinue to “subsidise” inadequate
production from trade-unionists
and others by expanding credit
and allowing the buying-power
of money to fall still further,
whereas other countries may de-
cide that inflation obviously can-
not cure a disease arising from
inadequate production from
each worker, and that, in any
case, stable money is necessary
to confident planning for indus-
trial expansion.
We cannot for ever go our
own sweet, foolish, politically
weak way even if we all want
to —and the majority of Aus-
tralians are already alarmed by
our industrial and economic
drift. We lived in an almost-
insulated economy during the
war, our dollar deficiencies
attended to by lend-lease and
the like. Since the war our
lowered standard of living has
been accepted as largely the
aftermath of war, not as what it
now principally is—inadequate
and costly production. The
march of world events will teach
us a sharp and bitter lesson un-
less we decide to stop playing
the fool and dancing to the tune
of the Communist saboteurs.

There is talk of a new issue
of ordinary shares, in the pro-
portion of one for two now held,
by Bradford Cotton Mills, A
premium of 13s. will be charged
on the 564,871 shares involved
in the issue ; previous offerings
have been at par. There are at
present 1,126,849 ords. issued,
as well as 153,104 prefs. When
all the new money is in paid
capital will be £1,844,824.
Bradford Cotton is the most

Its assets are conservatively

forising and other processes.
There is a record of steady divi-

which is the equivalent of 465.
ex rights. Assuming that the
10 p.c. dividend is maintained,
the yield at that figure is 4.3 p.c.
Replying to union claims* for
wage increases ranging up to
15 p.c., E. J. Morgan, chairman
of directors of Mt. Morgan, Ltd.
(Q.), said the company had
“survived by the skin of its
teeth over the past eight years,”
adding;
For £20,000 which must be set
aside ever year for the redemption
of preference shares, the company
holds no cash reserves. Reserves
built up from share premiums and
by charging depreciation have all
been reinvested in the business, mostly
for new plant and machinery. The
company had an overdraft of £257,992
at June 30 last, and since 1942 share-
holders had received nothing nor was
it possible for them to receive any-
thing if the mine was to be properly
equipped to meet rising costs. If
economic conditions were satisfac-
tory the mine had another 20 years
of life; if they were not its life was
six to eight years.
The Industrial Court reserved
its decision on the wage in-
creases. '

buying-power of this money at
the different dates, however, has

country’s biggest spendthrift,
isn’t helping by its extravagant
socialistic schemes. Chances
would be brighter if it effec-
tively wielded the economy axe.
But “Labor” jibs at cutting out
the dead wood; it prefers to
flog production along behind
import and currency barriers,
force up costs, add to overheads,
and generally it makes things
tough for business.

LONDON AIRMAIL
From Herbert Holman
All Britons were as shocked
to hear the bad news from
Buckingham Palace as they are
now anxious about the Kings
recovery The robust heaUhof
Queen Mary and the apparent
ease with which her sons have
borne their responsibilities .are
factors that have suggested a
royal immunity from ill-
health. Disappointment over
the indefinite postponement of
their Majesties’ tour is under-
standably less acute here than
m Australia and New Zealand,
but the enforced change of plan
does emphas.se how the per-
formance of his normal duties is
a constant threat to the Kings
health.
A dense fog of ashen white-
ness and dank penetration came
just in time for November to live
up to character. But notwith-
standine the groping paralysis
standing me groping paiaiysia
with which the life of the
Metropolis was temporarily
seized, there is no lack of good
humor. In days not altogether
remarkable for brotherly love, it
is refreshing to be able to re-
port one example of public
spirit A friend, crawling home
in his car late one evening,
stopped in answer to a shout. He
was told that his car was in the
middle of a main road, at right-
angles to the line of traffic. His
informant was a solicitor who
had organised a band of local
residents to lead stranded way-
farers to garage approaches,
where they might leave their cars
overnight. Unfortunately not
only Good Samaritans were
abroad that night; when my
friend went to collect he
found that four gallons of petrol
had been siphoned from his
had been sipnonea nom ms
arc dressed for
The sh e dr^ s f d
Christmas, effectively if scaicely
lavishly. But it is an anxious
time for parents, as pnees, P ar '
ticularly of toys, are high. One
Oxford-street store is carnival-
turned, with giant clowns on its
balconies: but the figures are
grotesque and slightly horrific,
so that it is a Roman rather
than a children s carnival. Other
large stores sport outsize Christ-
mas-trees; to the disappoint-
ment of children or all ages
their colored lamps dlo not
sprinkle the West End with
glimpses of fairyland. Austerity
regulations do not provide for
fairy an .
Nationalised Industry
Within a single week three
remedies for the too-slowly-pro-
gressing coal industry were put
forward. In three articles in
“The Times” Sir Charles Reid,
who resigned from the Coal
Board last May, gave his views.
Col. C. G. Lancaster, M.P., in
a political pamphlet, favors dras-
tic decentralisation and suggests
that the 49 areas should be
directly responsible to Parlia-
ment. Sir Charles affirms that
output per man-shift can be
doubled if absenteeism is re-
duced to the 1939 level, if fuller
use is made of mechanisation
and if a reasonable measure of
short-term reconstruction is
carried out. There is still, he
says, “no substitute for a good
day’s work honestly and happily
given.” He draws attention to
the fact that most of the mem-
bers of the divisional boards,
having lately been civil servants,
trade-union officials and officers
in the services, are without ex-
perience of “running any busi-
ness at all, not to speak of a
really large-scale enterprise.”
The report of the Burrows
Committee, which was set up in
May last to examine the or-
ganisation, has not itself been
published, although the Coal
Board has issued what seems to
be a bowdlerised version. It
changes little and excuses much ;
and it fails to satisfy a country
that seeks action, not excuses.
A colleague who has returned
from Sheffield after interviewing
steelworkers of all grades from
top to bottom confirms that the
industry is solidly opposed to
being nationalised. Even those
who have Labor sympathies
freely admit that it would be
wise to leave steel alone. One
foreman gave his opinion in
forthright Yorkshire style. “This
Government,” he said, “is like
t’fancy sort of housewife who
never learned to cook t’hard way
like her mother. She thinks
she only needs to buy a book
and t’rest will be easy. So she
takes breakfast kippers, pie for
dinner and fruit-salad for tea,
bundles ’em all in t’oven at
same temperature and for t’same
length of time. Result? Aye,
it’s a reet mess!”
Plays Old andf New
One happy circumstance
emerges, although indirectly,
from the revival of St. John
Hankin’s “The Return of the
Prodigal” (Globe Theatre): A.
E. Matthews, who created the
part of the ne’er-do-well central
character at the Court Theatre
in 1905, is currently starring in
a near-by theatre at the age of
nearly 80. All else had better
been left undisturbed. The play
“dates” in sentiment and expres-
sion as much as it does in style
and manners ; and, in truth, not-
withstanding the ill-fated talent
of the author, it is not a very
good play. Certainly it is less
than adequate as a vehicle for
the return to the London stage,
after an absence of two years,
of John Gielgud.
The plot: Eustace Jackson,
parvenu-born but Harrow-edu-
cated, fails at everything. So
papa gives him £lOOO spot
cash to disappear into a vast
and receptive domain for good-
for-nothings. (“He went away
years ago —to one of the
Colonies, I believe —and doubt-
less came to a bad end.”) As
nothing is heard of him, the
family fears are confirmed.
(“People in the Colonies always
write home for money.”) But
Eustace does turn up, after all,
penniless and ungrateful and in-
solent, He sponges on his
family until papa puts down an
Edwardian foot. Eustace must
go back to the Colonies. Papa
offers him another £lOOO (pay-
able on arrival at the other end)
on condition that he doesn’t
come back. But Eustace, who is
deuced clever, after a pretty line
in blackmail, gets away with an
annuity of £250 for life.
The “Colony,” as may already
have been guessed, is Australia.
So much does the English
theatre lack good new plays
that it is heartening to be able
to greet one, R. C. Sherriff’s
“Miss Mabel” (Duchess
theatre) is, for all its seeming
macabre content and cathedral-
close gentility, as accomplished
and stylish a piece of craftsman-
ship as a Sheraton sideboard.
Miss Mabel is a selfless old maid
who, because of her eager
benevolence, is widely admired.
While she, characteristically, has
little to give, her ailing harridan
of a sister has plenty of money
which is earmarked for an un-
worthy beneficiary. Miss Mabel
plays the fairy godmother, first
by forging another will and
then by administering to her
sister a poison of toadstool
soup. How the well-bred and
right-minded beneficiaries react
to the disclosure of the facts,
arid how Miss Mabel meets her
retribution, are woven into the
piece with a craft of consum-
mate subtlety, Mary Jerrold, .as
Miss Mabel, is tranquil, endear-
ing and heart-stirring.
The true beneficiary, de-
frauded by such good intention,
is also very far away. In com-
mon with Eustace, he is a “ras-
cal in Australia!”
“Playbill”
The play’s the thing that ac-
counts for the firm success of
“The Browning Version,” which
fills the first half of Terence
Rattigan’s “Playbill” at the
Phoenix theatre. To put on a
play that lasts for only one hour
is to depart boldly from con-
vention. The author’s decision
not to stretch it out into three
acts is to be commended. The
result, like a Mozart symphony,
is neither too long nor too short:
there are just as many lines as
are needed, and no more,
Andrew Crocker-Harris is a
master at a minor public school.
Once a brilliant classical scholar,
18 years at the school have
turned him into a confessed
failure whose self-defence is ex-
pressed in the exaction of strict
and petty discipline from his
pupils. So much is “the Crock”
disliked by the community in
which he lives that his very leav-
ing—because of ill-health —is a
cause of embarrassment. The
play reveals that his sour un-
popularity, if partly due to his
being a misfit, springs more
from the presence of his wife
(a Madame Bovary, but devoid
of her romanticism), whose only
virtue (“I never lie”) forces her
to taunt him with accounts of
her regular infidelities.
When Crocker-Harris hears
from his successor that the head-
master has referred to him as
the “Himmler of the Lower
Fifth” his mock-stoical patience
gives out and he breaks down.
A boy (whom he has just
punished) is the one person to
have any real affection for him,
and gives him a present—a
second-hand copy of a transla-
tion of AEschylus’s Agamemnon.
When, in the presence of
her latest victim, his wife
makes out that this gesture
is only another “rag,” the half-
hearted paramour is so overcome
with nausea that he rushes to
the side of the husband, whom
he compels to listen to advice.
Crocker-Harris’s battered spirit
responds with faint but definite
assertion. He defies his head-
master’s victimisation and shows
intention, if no more, of leaving
his wife.
Eric Portman, after eight years
of type-casting in films, returns
to the stage as Crocker-Harris.
Mary Ellis gives to the part of
the wife a malicious thorough-
ness.
“Playbill” ends with “A
Harlequinade,” in which
theatrical families, husband and
wife playing opposite each other
(“it’s so nice to know that they’re
really married”), ageing Shak-
spearean actors, weak support-
ing casts and State-sponsored
uplift are guyed with sureness
and polish. It is the same team
of actors. Hector Ross attracts
special praise for his “double.”
Marie Lohr makes a brief but
dynamic appearance in which
nothing is thrown away. Peter
Glenville produces both plays.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Bee Eye”: Regarding “Bughouse’s”
par. on wrecks sinking in deep water (B.
20/10/’4B). I have often wondered why
this ever became worthy of disputation.
If there ever was anything in it, how is
it that the bottom of the ocean is able
to stay down, it being only mud, sand or
rocks, all lighter than iron or steel?
* * * «
“Old-timer”: When Fitz heard that me
and George were leaving Merigal by
spring-cart to spend Christmas in Trangie,
he put it on us to take a sewing-machine
to his sister. There were big rains that year,
and when we got to the Gin Gin bridge
the river was up and a motley crowd of
bush jockeys, abos and * bagmen were
camped on our side, waiting for it to go
down. About all George and I had be-
tween us was 3s. 6d.—not much for
Christmas in Trangie unless Bluey Collins
turned up. We confidently expected
Bluey in from the Tottenham side with a
harvest cheque. There was a little jockey
bloke who spotted the sewing-machine in
our gear, and he got mighty inquisitive
and seemed to think that either George
or me was a woman in man’s clobber or
that we had a woman hidden back in the
brigalow somewhere. Anyhow, one thing
led to another, and before long the whole
floodbound camp, having nothing else to
do, was practising on that machine, sew-
ing up pants and shirts. Old Murmurin’
Mick tried to sew a flapping sole on his
left boot with it. So George and me
told ’em we’d won the thing in a raffle
down at Baradine and we’d decided to
raffle it again. We took 28s. and two
tins of tobacco and said she’d be drawn in
Trangie. Then the flood went down and
we got across and the mob streamed into
Trangie, where we saw that Fitz’s sister
won the raffle and then joined the mob
at the Royal. Bluey Collins? He went
down to Orange for the cherry-picking
and missed all the fun.
* * ♦ *
“Solitude”: Seventyfiver put down the
newspaper and eyed the young wallaby
in the corner. “Well, it ain’t my fault
that youngster had t’ blunder into the trap
I set,” he murmured sorrowfully. “And
a bloke could hardly do less than bring
’im in an’ fix ’is blasted foot.” “No,
and he’s done nothing but pinch the
tucker ever since,” I growled. “He and
those thieving magpies and the jackass
you’ve got around.” “Gripes, I ain’t got
’em, Sol,” he protested. “They come
theirselves, same as the possum. They’ll
get me into trouble, them things.” Next
day he took the wallaby into the bush,
ignored the magpies, made a half-hearted
attempt to shoo the possum from the roof
and refused to feed the lizards that pro-
truded from the slabs. The wallaby re-
turned, the magpies came inside swear-
ing horribly, and Blue was hard put to it
keeping the lizards out of the treacle.
Followed several days of mild warfare
before Seventyfiver gave in. “Sol, how
does a bloke go about getting a permit?”
he inquired. “What sort of permit?”
“Aw, well, any sort. Needn’t be any-
thin’ flash, or expensive,” he replied,
vaguely. “I see where they been gettin’
down on folks lately for havin’ birds an”
things without a permit.”
“Sth. E.”: Old Bill strolled in, nodded
his order and was settling comfortably
against the bar when the stranger in the
corner spoke. At the sound Bill’s mouth
opened ; deliberately he turned, then a
wondering grin broke on his dial, travelled
slowly, and linked up somewhere at the
back of his neck. “Well, tan me hide,”
he gasped. “If it ain’t ‘Dingo’ Ted.”
He dived at the stranger and threatened to
shake him to bits. “What underhand
stroke o’ crookedness brings a flamin’
ol’ bushranger like you round these
parts?” he bellowed heartily. “Ain’t seen
y’r ugly mug f’r years. Cripes, who y’
been swindlin’ since y’ lorst me, eh?”
He yelled for more refreshment and the
two settled to an exchange of recent
history. “Y’ blackmailin’ ol’ land-
shark!” Bill chuckled 20 minutes later,
“It’s sure good t’ What’sa matter?
Wrong change?” He paused as his old
mate called to the barkeep and began
pointing out that it was only one round
‘Wo, John —he CAN'T have his toys until Christmas morning!”
of drinks be owed for. “Yair, that’s
right,” Bill backed his friend readily.
“He only owes f’r this ’n. 01’ ‘Dingo’
might be the most low-down bloomin’
cattleduffer that ever jumped a blind
man’s claim, but by cripes, nob’dy c’n
say he ain’t honest /”

“Lower Tops’!”: Sailing along inside
Port Phillip Heads our 30-footer became
draped in cobwebs—weird festoons of
them which trailed from sheets, sails and
stays like water-weeds. The wind was
light northerly and many of those webs
must have drifted 15 to 20 miles across
the water. Queenscliff fishermen say the
phenomenon has occurred before, but
what beats me is where these spidery
contraptions come from. They were
everywhere, and Port Phillip is hundreds
of square miles in area.

“Trim”; One of the greatest problems
in Shaggy’s life was to reconcile his
description of a property as a real-
estate salesman for the purpose of effect-
ing a sale with that which he gave when
operating as a certified public valuator
for probate purposes. Since the addition
of valuating under National Security
regs. Shaggy has become a diplomat of
the first order. One case in particular
was a small, highly-improved dairy-
farm. A 100-acre plot with modern resi-
dence which cost £lOOO to build, plus
barn, dairy, garage, machinery-shed,,
milking-shed, etc., worth another thou-
sand. That made 20 quid an acre with-
out land, stock, plant, furniture, house-
hold effects, etc. Shaggy had had the
outfit on his books for a couple of years
at 15 guineas an acre, walk-in-walk-out,
and described it as a desirable, highly-
improved scrub farm, free of noxious
weeds, permanent water-supply, lovely
home and so on. Then the owner died
and Shaggy got the probate job, and the
farm became forest country, badly in-
fested with Johnson-grass and wild mint,
with a poor water-supply—bore needed
deepening, and the house was white-ant-
eaten. “How else can I get the place
down to its sale value?” asked Shaggy.
Then the war came. Shaggy now has a
cove breaking his neck to buy at 20 quid
an acre bare, and Shaggy’s “security”
valuation is, he hopes, a “best seller.”

“Nakhoda”: Honey, the mare, was
standing in the home paddock with her
foal, a big one, standing beside her. Sud-
denly the mare raced down the paddock,
doubled on her tracks, reared and bucked,
and tore back again. After repeating
these manoeuvres half a dozen times she
went back to her foal with that look of
complacency one only sees on the face
of a mother who has done her duty—
she had protected her offspring from a
rabbit!
* * * *
“Mug”: Cripes, that bay mare o’ mine
’s a cow t’ jump out, an’ because I want
her special t’day I get up to find she’s
gone. It’s an easy bet where she’ll be,
seein’ I got her from old Dobbie in town,
an’ goin’ out into the road I spots her
tracks makin’ that way. So off I starts.
Six miles it is, but knowin’ there’s no
other way o’ gettin’ her back, I stuck to
it, hopin’ all the time I’d find her round
the next turn. But no, I’m in town, round
the pub corner, an’ passin’ the store
before I see the brute hangin’ over
Dobbie’s fence. I slips on the halter an’
drags her back them six miles as
fast as I can hoof it out just to show her.
I just get her home and am clampin’ the
saddle on her when that old prospector
from up river drops in. I tells him what’s
happened. “An’ where are y’ goin’ now?”
he asks me. “Into town, o’ course,” I
says, “Been plannin’ for days t’ get
meself some more tea, an’ I’m not drinkin’
water any longer just t’ suit that flamin’
nag.” Last I seen o’ the old coot he was
leanin’ on the hitchin’-stump laughin’ fit
t’ bust. Alwus was a bit barmy, that
bloke.
* * * *
“Smacker”: The boss of the place we’d
landed jobs at was a good scout, but his
wife soon started turning on her levy:
sixpence for each swear-word. The six
quid a week we were getting with tucker
quickly shrank to four quid, and when
we realised how much she’d taken off we
got so wild that next week we drew only
two. Then she put on extra levies for
failing to shave and clean our boots, and
a heavy one for smoking in bed. We
left before the Small Debts Court people
caught up with us over the couple of
weeks’ wages we owed.
* * * *
“Stoopy”: Snakes have been fairly
prevalent during hay-carting, and old
Hawk-eye, the load-builder, was very
caustic because my swipes never
registered better than near-misses. “If it
weren’t for me crook back I’d come down
an’ pitch —then I’d, show y’! ” he growled.
One snake got tangled with a sheaf and
landed on top with him. They dead-
heated back to the ground, and the old
bloke chased Joe to its hole and grabbed
its tail. Pulling hard, he crashed over
backwards with half its twitching body
still grasped in his hands. Which moves
me to ask: If snakes can’t go backwards,
how do they dig their holes?
* * * *
“Thoughts”; The bandicoots had
found my sweet-potato patch and were
mutilating more than what they were eat-
ing. One night Mac, my foxy cross,
was put on guard duty, and soon his
yelps were heard gradually fading in the
distance, indicating his pursuit of one of
the ’coots. When he started barking I
got my axe and went after him. The
’coot had for home an old fallen gum
about 24in. in diameter with a pipe of
approximately 9in. Lighting a fire to
work by, I trimmed a handy sapling and
shoved it up the log. The grunt came at
7ft., so, knowing he could get no further,
I put in a scarf just short of it and
another one a foot higher. We settled
the thief and vandal, but the dog kept
nosing and whining round the cut log.
On the off-chance I probed again;
another grunt came just above the top
cut, and in a few minutes another ’coot
was bagged. It’s the only time in years
I’ve found two bandicoots in the one
log.
* * ♦ ♦
“Taswegian”: Last harvest season i
worked for a farmer on Yorke Peninsula
(S.A.). In his spare time from driving the
tractor and header, milking and separat-
ing, packing eggs, tending sheep and
building a mouse-proof base for a new
haystack, he was installing a wind-driven
lighting plant. I used to be an electrical
fitter, so when he had a bit of trouble
with the generator I thought I’d try to
help him. I that the brush wasn’t
sitting snugly on the ring, so I suggested
that he bed it properly. He asked me
what I meant; when I explained he
reckoned it would be too much trouble.
(About a dozen pulls with a bit of sand-
paper would have done it!) I thought
blast him, and left him to it. But al-
though I realised he knew as much about
electrical work as I did about farming
(among other things, he continually re-
ferred to the commutator as the arma-
ture) I wasn’t prepared fpr his best
effort. For the wiring inside the house
he was using twin-core, plastic-covered
flex; to secure it to the wall he hadn’t
bothered with such fancy gadgets as
saddles, but had driven nails clean
through the centre of the wire. And the
thing worked!
* * * #
“1.J.”: “Kelms’s” assumption (B.
1/12/’4B) that seeds take a day longer
to germinate for each year of age is
haywire. Germination depends on the
seed itself and the prevailing conditions
of the soil. Seed consists of an embryo
which is surrounded by two seed-coats
called the testa. Before the embryo can
send out its shoot the testa has to rot.
The percentage of moisture in the soil
may be great or small; thus the time
taken for the testa to rot will vary. Also,
seeds often remain dormant from one
growing period to another, and so even
if the testa rots and the conditions are
right, the seed may remain dormant for
a period varying from days to weeks.

“Refidex”: The description of the
boomerangs made by the blacks of the
Canboomerri tribe as “curios” (B.
8/12/’4B) brings to mind the period I
spent as a medical officer in the area in
1943-44, when I was often a guest of the
Spanish monks who run the Drysdale
Mission, and for some time lived in the
old mission building 16 miles away.
Built many years ago, it appears from
a distance as of typical Spanish type,
complete with the pointed arches and
cloisters beloved of medieval Spain. But
at closer view, it is seen to be built of
peeled logs covered with flat galvanised-
iron, roasting-hot in the wet season, but
surrounded by a pleasant grove of man-
goes and fringed by coconut-palms. This
old mission was abandoned some years
before the war because of trouble be-
tween the natives and Jap pearlers, and
the new mission—of hewn stone —was
built by the monks on a site 16 miles
from the coast on the banks of the
Drysdale River, It was in the chapel
of this new mission that the organ
presented by the German Govern-
ment in token of the rescue of the two
airmen was placed and later destroyed
by Jap bombs. The mission building
was undamaged, but Father Thomas,
sheltering in a slit-trench with a couple
of native children huddled beneath him,
was killed. There were no other casual-
ties, and “Kilkennicat’s” claim that the
mission was “wiped out” is an overstate-
ment. Actually, the whole bombing was
probably a mistake, as it is possible that
the Japs had received information that
the place was an important R.A.A.F.
radar station. That was the old mission ;
the new one received the attack. On the
matter of boomerangs, it appears that
they were known in this area before the
war, but only in the form of “props”
for corroboree use. One which I have is
a flat piece of wood, curved, but with no
suggestion of the twist found in utility
models. Of course, there were many of
these made as curios during the war, but
they didn’t originate as just curios. As
I had many times to treat the natives and
got to know them and the monks well, I
was permitted to attend real corroborees
and have seen these “property” boomer-
angs, brightly-painted with red and white
designs, used by the painted dancers, pre-
sumably to convey the meaning that the
bearer represented a man from a far-off
tribe.
LOW TIDE AT THE HEADS.
While we slept, unknowing, the tide had run
out.
Noiselessly, giving no warning that it meant
To turn its back on the neat row of stucco
houses 8
Lining the cove’s foreshore. Tired holiday-
makers
Lying beside their wives dreamt of great red-
mouthed fish
Threshing the green water, rising from emerald
depths.
Sending the gut lines singing through their
salt-rimed hands.
At sunrise there was only the wide mud-flat,
With a pool of blood far out where the morn-
ing light
Flashed in the shallow water brimming a back-
wash.
Herons stalked disdainfully on the edge of the
red lake,
Sometimes unbending a moment to snap up a
titbit.
The grey rocks seemed faintly embarrassed,
leaving
Their oysters exposed for a curious world to see.
Sea-gulls squabbled like fish-wives—common
creatures,
Flying and swooping, garrulous, greedy and
shrewd,
Entirely lacking refinement of any sort;
Yet, when they float on the water, a grace
attends them.
Curlews ran on the mud-flat, feasting on scraps
Of meat, bait and entrails of gutted fish.
Forlorn were the stranded dinghies, humped on
the sand.
From the tiny chimneys of the cottages
Smoke puffs up. Children run to the beach
With buckets and spades to dig up the neat
white sand.
Soon orange-peel and crust scraps will be
scattered,
Death-traps for elderly feet will lurk under
moats
Of shell-lined castles. Shoes will be lost,
And old men will sleep in the warm, bone-
soaking sun.
Around the base of the point there’ll be a
telltale
Hollow where lovers lay during the starry night.
Deep in the loose sand is the print of their
bodies,
Quickened by love, washed by the song of the
sea,
But with the litter, the castles, the deep-dug
pits.
The pearly shells, and the wreaths of gold-
flecked seaweed,
The hollow where love rested will be washed
away
By the surging tide, neat as a housewife’s
conscience.

“North Arm”: A wandering American
professor blew into the N.S.W. milk city
of Lismore the other day, gathered half
a thousand cow-cockies in the local show-
ground and assured them that “cows
possess the counterpart of every human
characteristic.” The startled assembly
learned further that there were cows
which were “maladjusted and unhappy,”
some were “psychiatric cases” or “com-
pletely insane,” all made “pleasant or un-
pleasant associations with people, objects
and places” ; what’s more, “a good ad-
justment between milker and cow” was
the best way to fill the bucket. After
which the Richmond River country, pre-
sumably, was dotted with thoughtful cow-
cockies leaning on bails eyeing their herds
and trying to “adjust” themselves to the
bovine psyche. For my own part, having
once associated with the creatures, I sup-
port the notion of cows having their
human counterparts (the boss was usually
a fair cow and one brindle Guernsey was
the dead ring of my Aunt Martha), but
I never dreamed that the red heifer who
used to bawl all night was “maladjusted.”
However, that doesn’t matter, since the
butcher has long since readjusted her, but
it distresses me to think that the thirty-
bob and keep I got for “associating” with
the things was wasted. I never achieved
“a good adjustment” with them.

“Hanko”: We arrived at Uncle Luke’s
place at 10 a.m. “Come in and have a
cup of tea,” said Mrs. Luke when we’d
unhitched the mare. “No, no,” Luke
“Wake up, Bill! Here comes our Christmas issue!”
intervened hastily. - “It’ll spoil their
dinner, an’ we got turkey an’ duff an’
cake” “An’ jelly an’ nuts an’ leming-
ade,” piped one of the kids. Mrs. L.
pressed us, but Luke was making signs
that we could not ignore. “I’ll give the
old nag a bucket of chaff,” he said. “An’,
seem’ it’s Christmas, a dipper of oats,
too.” So he dredged a bottle of Highland
Mist and three glasses from the feed-bin
and we drank the compliments and so
forth. Next it was a bottle of Highland
Glen, or Brae, or Burn—Highland, any-
how. We were half-way down a bottle
of Purple Heather when one of the kids
said dinner was ready. One look at the
set table rich with festive foodstuffs and
I about-turned and finished in a loose
heap behind the fowlhouse. Days later
I managed to surround a dry crust and
one pickled onion. The boss still swears
he didn’t eat again that year.

“Caltex”: The beer session was finished
in the Greek-owned pub in our North
Queensland sugar town, but Ned and
Josh held their positions and called for
rum. Watching Tony decant a measure
of the doubtful-looking juice into his
glass, Josh was impelled to remark causti-
cally “Jamaica?” Tony smiled benignly.
“No,” he said. “My brother ina Ham-
bledon — he maka her. Fit for a king!”
And he wiped the mist off his spectacles.

“Mat’s Mate”; We cleaned up a scrub-
cutting contract out of Pinnaroo about a
fortnight before Christmas and decided
to head for Melbourne. While Mat was
rubbing out our debts in the town I wired
the old Windsor pub for rooms. Then
Jack Wilson discovered us and wanted us
to cut a couple of hundred acres on his
place. Nothing doing. He pleaded,
argued, upped his price by deeners an
acre, promised qs a. bonus and a free
Christmas dinner at a Pinnaroo pub. We
were unmoved. We’d washed the dust
off, were wearing brand-new suits, our
year’s work was done. Wilson kept at
us, bht the drinks beat him in the end,
and we left him sleeping in the parlor
while we headed for Ouyen and the
Mildura-Melbourne express. We hit the
Windsor about 10 the next night. Next
morning we hit the dining-room. So did
about 25 young women—a croquet team
or something from Tasmania. They must
have reckoned we were big-gun city
■blokes, the way they eyed us. Mat got up
and went straight away and wired Wilson
we’d be back at once and to hold the
contract. You’d have thought the croquet
team wanted to eat the silly cow.

“Betcha”: For “The O.D.’s” benefit
(B. 17/11/’4B), not only does a sheep
have no difficulty in grinding whole maize
with his perfectly developed set of
grinders, but even lambs of two and
three months crunch them easily, and
hunt them eagerly along the ground once
they have been persuaded to try them
out. The trouble is to get them started ;
for sheep are such creatures of habit they
are reluctant to sample anything they
haven’t seen before,

“Khasi Rokok” : Sitting in a country
retreat traditionally favored by spiders,
I tossed a match into a substantial web.
The proprietor, a daddy-long-legs,
whipped round to view the source of
vibration; approached a few steps, and
gave everything a vigorous shake.
Puzzled, he came a little closer, chose a
strand leading to the match, pulled it back
to his ear like a bow-string, let go, and
considered the vibration with all eight
feet. Deciding there was no future in
it, he turned and retired to his corner.
I flipped the ash off my cigarette ; it
broke into several fragments, most of
which were caught in the web, The
spider came out again and picked on one
fragment, the size of a grain of wheat,
with nothing about it to distinguish it
from the others. Each of his eight feet
seemed to have its own eye as he ap-
proached—at any rate, each foot was
raised, advanced and lowered precisely
on to its own almost-invisible strand with
no fumbling. He tried the bow-string
test again, and seemed more keen about
it this time. He came closer, reached out
and delicately prodded the ash, knocking
a fine sh&wer off it. He came closer
still and seemed to nibble it, knocking
some more off. He sat back, thought
deeply, then with decision started to wrap
the parcel up to take home. Two back
legs took the job op, working steadily
and alternately, as if he were pedalling
a bike; the parcel twisted round and
round in the thread, and when it had
some cohesion he gathered it up and took
it to his corner. There he settled down
to finish the job of parcelling, and per-
haps is still at it; I left him to it. There
may be a moral in all this, but I would
like to know: Why doesn’t a spider stick
to his own web? How do the behaviorists
“Spare a coupla prawns, mate?”
account for the testings, the doubts and
the decisions—and the final foolishness?
How do wagtails and rock-robins manage
to handle web in the neat and intricate
work of nest-making? And why does
daddy-long-legs get the occasional fit of
revolving, so fast that he becomes in-
visible? lam told he is not a real spider,
anyhow.

“Bo”: “You don.’t see fencin’ done as
accurate these days as y’ useter,” said
Corkeye Corrigan. “Me old mate Fly By
Knight was a wizard. I remember once
him takin’ a contract with old Bottrell out
at Saddleback Ridge for half a mile o’
six-wire fencin’. It was hilly, and hard
goin’ in sandstone country, but he had
half a mile of it up in two days on his
own. Before he put the wire up Fly By
got his rifle an’ fires a bullet through the
top hole of one strainer-post. He was
dead wild because it finished up quarter
of an inch off the hole in the strainer-
post at the end o’ the line —that’s how
accurate he was in puttin’ ’em up!” “But
you said it tvas hilly country he was
workin’ in,” put in Long Bob. “How
could the bullet have gone through all
the top holes in the posts ip that case?”
“That’s all right,” said Fly By, without
batting an eyelash. “Y’ see, the fence
went along straight for a good bit an’
then went down the hill. The bullet did
the same when its trajectory started to
fall.”

“Zake”: One of the visitors to the pre-
Christmas party at the little bush home-
stead had brought a demijohn of home-
made whisky. Dad took a swig of it.
When his eyes stopped swivelling, his
whiskers had subsided and he at last got
his breath back he said, “Gripes, Joe,
that stuff rips you open all the way
down!” The donor wiped the top of
the demijohn, lifted it to his lips, took
a deep breath, closed his eyes and said,
“Yair, but I’ll guarantee it to sew y’ up
on its way back!”

“Taswegian”: “M.U.R.” (B. 1/12/’4B)
is up a gum in questioning The Bul-
letin’s Service Department. The
common mina (Acridotheres tristis), a
native, of India and Afghanistan, is of
a different genus from the Australian
miners. Those native to Australia are
the noisy miner {Myzantha melanoce-
phald); the dusky miner C Myzantha
obscura ); the yellow-throated miner (My-
zantha flavigula ); and the • bell miner
{Manorina melanophrys). “M.U.R.’s”
“soldier bird” is the noisy miner, the only
one of the four that we have here in
Tasmania. All recognised authorities
agree that the spelling of the Australian
birds is miner,' not mina, myna or minah.
“CAT.”: Veil “E.H.S.” (B.
11/11 /’4B) that we never cogged the
shoes of our saddle-hacks in the Goodra-
digbee country. Nothing could stop our
horses from sliding on this mountain’s
perpendicular sides. When descending
from summit to valley floor we would
assist the mokes by easing duf of the
saddle and sitting on the rump. This was
a precautionary measure also, to keep
the heavier hindquarters from toppling
over the withers and sending the horse
somersaulting down the slopes.

“Olive Willey”; This is from E. V.
Timms’s Forever to Remain : —■
But the glory of the bush had faded;
winter was coming, and the scented
blossoms of creepers, trees and plants had
fallen and withered. Another spring and
summer must come before Nature presented
once again the fragrance and splendor of
the wildflowers.
Well, well! I always thought the frag-
rance and splendor of bush flowers were
most noticeable in September and October
—at least the Westralian Railway De-
partment thinks so, for it runs special
excursion trains among the hills to allow
people to witness the glorious sight,

“E.C.8.”: We were trying to inveigle
a heavy and very obstinate pig on to a
motor-truck, with no success despite a
great deal of coax-
ing, shoving and re-
viling. Finally Boris
lay down and that
settled us flat. For
some time I had
been conscious we
were being watched
from the fence by an
ancient pensioner,
who presently came
over and croaked
“Here, lad, lemme
show you.” Leisurely
taking up a kero-
sene-tin he jammed
it over Boris’s
twitching snout. Im-
mediately the porker
scrambled to his feel
and frantically tried
to back away from
the tin. Then it
was that the old-
timer firmly steered
Boris in reverse up
the ramp. The tin was removed, the door
closed and the lesson learned.

“B. A. Ker”: Over the years I’ve often
wondered whether old Karl Johansen
really had been the man he prqtended to
have been or whether he merely based his
wonderful personal-adventure stories on
“Peter the Whaler” or similar salty
fiction. But in those days I, and the three
or four other boys privileged to sit in
the shade cast by his tent-cnm-shack,
never doubted that he had been the best
harpooner that ever sailed from Norway,
“where the best whalers come from.”
I don’t think Karl would have been in
favor of the harpoon-gun and its ex-
plosive missile ; and I’m certain he would
never have held his small audiences so
completely enthralled if, instead of vividly
describing the excitement when “There
she blows!” roared from the crow’s-nest,
he had tried to draw a word picture of a
man picking up an object, presumed to be
a whale, on a radar-screen. No doubt
it is a carryover from the old
Norwegian’s stories that makes me take
an interest in the whaling projects now
being organised. The British whalers,
according to reports, will use an electric
harpoon, as it kills or. paralyses more
quickly than any other weapon. Karl
would not have approved; he knew no-
thing about electricity, but on principle
he would have supported the chap I
heard declaring: “It’ll be dangerous to be
within miles of ’em. Water is a conduc-
tor of electricity; they won’t only kill
every fish in the area, but a man would
only have to have his finger in the water
and he’d get electrocuted.” My personal
opinion is that a current powerful enough
to kill a whale would not hurt a smaller
fish. The reason is that a big bulk offers
more resistance and is therefore stricken
with more violence than an object would
be that allows the current to pass through
unchecked. Anybody who doubts this
truth can prove it by gripping the busi-
ness end of an electric goad. He won’t
feel as much as a tingle. But a touch
with the same thing will cause wild,
nervous cattle to leap forward along a
slaughter-yard chute, despite the smell of
blood that .warns of the death ahead.
A CHRISTMAS RIDE.
Over the hills and far away
From Cudgewa to Bright,
We rode the wild lands m the day
And camped in them by night.
Tallangatta Creek was crystal clear
And singing its mountain air,
But we rode on, the time was near
And we couldn’t spend Christmas there.
The western scarps were steep and wild
And the Mitta ran below,
The Herefords watched us as we filed
Where the shy tree-climbers go.
Twas grand when the sun climbed up the sky
And gilded the maidenhair,
But we rode on without a sigh,
For we couldn’t spend Christmas there.
Tall are the trees of the mountains,
And hidden glens are sweet
Where the Mitta’s lonely fountains
The thirsty travellers greet.
How good in the tree-fern shadows
To hide from summer’s glare,
But we left the cooling meadows
For we couldn’t spend Christmas there.
The myrtle was green in the valley,
The Kiewa sheathed in rain;
We counted the miles in our tally
And saddled the horses again.
Far Hotham’s white cap was glowing,
And vanished the mist in the glare,
But we rode, and watched the rain going,
For we couldn’t spend Christmas there.
Over the hills and far away
We saw a township’s lights,
Against the dusk of a dying day
And the dark of the outer heights.
We spurred our nags, nor camped that night,
And we rode, a reckless pair,
For below were the golden lamps of Bright
And we meant to spend Christmas there.
N.S.W.
OLD-TIMER.
ON THE THOMSON-SIDE.
/
The old horse stood in the field so green,
And thought of the past and the things he’d
seen.
Now times were good and the seasons fair;
But he’d known times when the hot sun's
glare
Had dried the water and shrivelled the grass
Till the land was dry and as bare as glass.
Till the land was bad, and far and wide,
From the Warrego to the Thomson-side,
The big roan bull to the native cat,
Lay bleaching white on the broad bare flat;
The squatters swore and wrung their hands
At jumbuck bodies on hot white sands.
And when it seemed it would never rain.
The dark clouds gathered, it came again;
And sheets of water covered the clay,
Baked hard and dry as the summer’s day;
The dark green grass grew far and wide.
And times were good on the Thomson-side.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO GRAZCOS."
Starting with Sheep.
“Atlanta”; “Ngaduri” (B.
17/11/’4B) presents some
original and highly unconven-
tional ideas. By all means start
with a good line of c.f.a. ewes.
But consider yourself a genius
if you can get them from a re-
putable stud, even if you can
afford to pay prices which this
type of sheep commands. There
aren’t enough studs going to
meet the demand for c.f.a. ewes,
and most studs have buyers
who reserve first offer each
year.
Breeding your own rams just
doesn’t pay. Apart from the
necessary technical knowledge,
breeding experience and ex-
pense involved, you’ll need
scores of netted paddocks to
keep tag on various small
lots of ewes and their pro-
geny. If you can’t afford 10 or
12 guineas for good flock rams,
buy them c.f.a., too. Many big
properties which buy young
rams each year are glad to sell
six-year-olds at a reasonable
price. You may need a slightfy
higher percentage in relation to
ewe numbers, but if paddocks
are no larger than about 2000
acres or so and are reasonably
well watered you’ll get fair re-
sults.
Medium-fine Merino wools
are in greatest demand at pre-
sent, but if your ewes are
strong-woolled don’t try to breed
a fine-woolled type by mating
with superfine-woolled rams.
You’ll get an assortment of
types that will break the classer’s
heart, give you a collection of
star lots and reduce your re-
turns accordingly. Last, and
most important—no matter how
large or small your flock —cull
rigidly and dispose of every-
thing which does not conform to
the standard you have set.
N.Q. Clover Problem.
“Agric”; Heavy white-clover
growth in the Eungella Range
district has presented the State
with one of its most unusual
problems. During recent years
numerous legumes have been in-
troduced by the Department of
Agriculture into this area, and
S. Marriott, B.Sc., agrostologist,
has been surveying the pasture-
research work in the dairying
areas of the north. Following
a favorable winter this year,
some farmers there are wonder-
ing whether exceptionally heavy
clover-growth is not unduly
suppressing grasses’ growth.
Since the legumes were intro-
duced there has been a steady
increase in the quantity of white
clover in the pastures.
Marriott is the first full-time
departmental agrostologist to
concentrate on pasture-research
work in dairying areas, and the
white-clover “problem” will re-
ceive early attention. At ths
various experimental stations
good work is being done. In the
Mackay district spray irrigation
of 20 acres of Para-grass on old
sugarcane land, which has been
subdivided into two-acre plots,
is proving very interesting in
“Which tap do I turn on for cream ?”
view of the known underground
water supplies and large areas
of flat country in that district.
The economic aspect of a plot
established by G. Muller, Home-
view Jersey Stud, Mackay, is to
be investigated, as the green-
feed is much appreciated by* the
cows. At the department’s
Bureau of Tropical Agriculture,
South Johnstone, controlled
grazing by a small, graded Short-
horn herd is being done after
initial success with grass and
legume mixtures; the animals
are being weighed regularly to
determine liveweight gains.
Subdivision is an integral part
of the experiment, and if it
proves a success the north will
have another string to its bow.
At present, however, lack of
buying competition robs the
northern cattlemen of the high
prices cattle realise in southern
Queensland, but the anticipated
erection of public abattoirs in
Townsville and Rockhampton—-
Townsville to have priority—
should improve the position.
The Air-cleaner.
“Radian”: Abrasive matter
drawn in through the air-induc-
tion will play havoc with any
engine; yet the air-cleaner is
often neglected when other
points are checked over. A
choked air-cleaner will upset the
air-fuel ratio, resulting in loss
of power, high fuel consump-
tion and a smoking exhaust. To
check for this fault uncouple or
remove the cleaner with the en-
gine running. If the cleaner is
choked the exhaust will immedi-
ately change color.
Makers’ instructions should
be faithfully followed when ser-
vicing cleaners, because Of the
variation between makes and
models. Petrol is an effective
cleansing medium after the
(Cleaner has been dismantled;
but make certain—particularly
in the case of diesel engines—
that all parts have thoroughly
dried-off before they are as-
sembled. Petrol fumes can blow
a diesel head off.
When refitting check for
leaks where air could be drawn
in without having passed
through the normal intake.
Joints can.often be rendered air-
tight by using felt washers or
strips cut from an old hat. In
the case of oil-wash cleaners
the used oil often looks too
clean to discard; but without
exception it is full of minute
abrasive particles and useful
only as a vermin killer.
Why Sheep Break.
“Ben Acre”: It’s the natural
fear of being cornered.
At the approach of danger
flight is natural, and a sheep
knows that to outrun and get past
its pursuer is probably avoiding
being cornered. To try to head
it only adds to its fear and deter-
mination to escape. Young
sheep, especially newly-weaned
lambs, are most likely to break.
Before letting them out of the
yard see that the way is clear,
and, as they leave the yard, turn
them in the direction they are
wanted to go. Then let them
run. Without trying to stop
their gallop guide them with a
steady dog or by riding alongside
the lead. The rear can easily be
induced to follow. After a short
run they will stop to feed and
can be quietly driven away.
It is the same instinctive fear
that causes lambs to break from
a mob—such as when mustering
for marking. To attempt to
drive them back only aggravates
the fear; if left alone, the lamb
will probably run a few yards,
prop, and run back to the mob.
Or walking straight towards the
lamb will induce it to go back.
If they get beyond this, take a
few ewes out to them to gather
them up.
D.D. for Root-knot.
“Nubis”: Trials conducted
by the Department of Agricul-
ture (W.A.) prove that D.D.
fumigant (B, 17 /11 / ’4B) will
practically eradicate root-knot.
Roots from treated soils were
almost free from galls, while
those from untreated were
badly' galled. In a few cases
galls were present in plants
from treated soil —due, it is
thought, to later contamination
from adjacent infested plots.
Yields were considerably in-
creased by treatment and, in the
case of root-crops, the propor-
tion of first-grade vegetables was
much higher.
Average yields were increased
by 20 p.c. (parsnips) and 71 p.c.
(carrots), while the percentage
of first-grade parsnips was
doubtful and first-grade carrots
increased by 50 p.c. As inferior
grades of root-crops are usually
unsaleable, this means a con-
siderably increased return to the
grower. Treatment is expensive.
At 2i c.c. per foot, it would
cost £3O per acre. An increased
return of at least H tons per
acre would be required to com-
pensate for this at present prices
(about £2O per ton). In the ex-
perimental plots first-grade pars-
nips were increased by over
three tons to the acre and car-
rots by about 2+ tons to the
acre.
To use D.D. prepare the
ground as for setting out plants ;
break down large clods and
leave for a fortnight before
treatment. Make rows of holes
Ift. apart and 6in. deep, stag-
gering the rows. Put half tea-
spoonful of D.D. in each hole
(one pint will treat about
320 sq. ft.). Use a funnel so
that the fumigant goes into the
bottom of each hole, then cover
with soil and water. Planting
can be done three weeks later,
first opening up the ground to
let the fumes escape. For large
areas of ground an injection-gun
is more suitable.
D.D. should not be applied
within 30in. of growing plants.
Avoid breathing the fumes. If
splashed with D.D. wash with
soap and water or your skin
may be inflamed.
A Wonder (?) Wheat.
“He-Ne”: The other week a
sort of a kind of a howl of
triumph emanated from N.S.W.
Department of Agriculture about
a “new” wheat that was to im-
prove bread quality, be rust-
resistant and withstand frost and
cold. But the “new” wheat has
not yet been bred. What has
been done is that winter Minflor
has been crossed with Charter.
This progeny has not been fixed,
neither has it been tested for
yield. Most wheats now being
grown in N.S.W. are spring
wheats sown in autumn, and
nearly all are subject to frost and
cold damage; if so effected
their yields are reduced. A win-
ter wheat is one that demands a
period of low temperatures be-
fore heading can take place.
Minflor is the parent in the pre-
sent experiments, but there are
one or two South American
varieties also available. These,
unlike most of the North Ameri-
can winter wheats, are reason-
ably early maturing. Until the
Minflor-Charter cross is fixed
and has proved to be a good
yielder the department should
be wary of extravagant claims.
Rearing Orphans.
“Billjfrn”: Because mare’s
milk contains much less fat but
more sugar than cow’s milk,
choose milk from a cow in the
first part of her lactation

units are supplied for the price of one. Rainbow’s
outlet is of simple, ingenious design, made for both
underground and portable systems.
2. Two stands support each 24 ft. pipe—yet pipe
and stands may be carried with ease by one man.
Absence of cross bars avoids damage to vegetation.
3. The screw-on spray head covers 48 ft. under
normal conditions at 17 lbs. pressure. A square
spray is thrown, and a larger jet ensures a

Feed a quarter-pint every hour
for the first day or so, warming
to 100 deg. F. and using an
ordinary nursing or other small
bottle with a large nipple, care-
fully cleaned and sterilised.
Gradually increase the milk
if the foal is doing well, lengthen-
ing the periods between feeds
until it is getting four a day.
After a few days feed unmodi-
fied whole milk and teach the
foal to drink from a pail. In
five or six weeks introduce skim-
milk and at three months give
the foal all it will drink three
times daily. Feed solid food —
crushed oats, good-quality hay
—and let it graze as soon as
possible.
As a ewe’s milk is riclj in fat,
so should be the strength of
cow’s milk for poddy lambs. In
some cases it may be necessary
to add fresh separator cream.
Use milk from the same cow
for three or four weeks. For
the first day or two after birth
feed only two to four teaspoon-
fuls of milk at a time, four times
in 24 hours, using a medium
nipple. After the lamb is two
to three weeks old, feed three
times a day.
Jersey milk should be chosen
for piglets and fed five or six
times a day until three or four
weeks old, then reduce to three
feeds. A bottle and nipple may
be used, but with patience they
may be started with a shallow
dish. Push the pig’s mouth and
nose into the milk to get it
started. One quart of milk daily
is sufficient. Allow access to
fresh water. Skim-milk can be
substituted when the pigs are
eating crushed grain.
An Apple Upset.
“J.D.”; For the second time
in three years apple-orchardists
in the Huon (Tas.) district have
been dealt crippling blows by
heavy hailstorms. The other
day one such storm within 15
minutes reduced next season’s
crop by nearly a million bushels.
A grower who normally markets
about 11,000 bushels will now
not pick one, and on several
orchards no further cultivation
will be done until next season.
The Government has promised
financial relief, but it’s likely
that this will be subject to con-
ditions, as the growers have
previously refused to contribute
to an insurance scheme to cover
such contingencies.
T.B. in Fowls.
“MoZzer”: It isn’t prevalent,
but once stock are infected it
spreads rapidly. It becomes ap-
parent mostly in older fowls,
which show loss of condition,
develop diarrhoea and frequently
become lame, A fairly reliable
test is to have a vet. inject a
small amount of tuberculin in
the wattle. If the bird has the
disease a swelling will show at
the site of the injection. In-
fection is spread mainly through
the droppings. If it appears all
drinking- and feeding-troughs
should be thoroughly disin-
fected ; and it is best not to use
the yard for two years, as the
germ can exist that long. The
alternative is to use the disin-
fectant freely to cleanse the en-
closure and fittings; and re-
move six inches of topsoil be-
fore putting in new stock. T.B.
in fowls is not hereditary.
Tattooing Calves.
“Nubis”: Best done as soon
after birth as possible, one-day
old is the ideal time. If by your-
self it will be necessary to bail
them or tie them short by the
head. If you have an assistant
get him to stand astride the
calf, holding its head back over
its shoulder. In this position it
will stay quiet. If you stand
alongside, facing the same
direction as the calf, you will
have no difficulty. Use full
pressure on the pliers and re-
lease quickly to avoid tearing.
Stove-polish (paste form) is
better than ink for tattooing,
being easier to use and more dis-
tinct —even in blacks. No need
to fill the needles —clean the in-
side of the. ear, make the punc-
tures, then rub in a little polish.
It is as well to isolate the calf
for 24 hours to prevent others
sucking out the dye.
If on your first attempt at
tattooing make sure the letters
are the right way up before using
the pliers—try it on a leaf or a
piece of paper. When the pliers
are held head-downwards the
letters should be upright and
back-to-front (as if seen in a
mirror).
Fertilisers for Citrus.
“Myrr”: A citrus-tree requires
much more nitrogen than the
soil can supply, and it has to be
applied by artificial fertilisers or
by growing and turning in
leguminous crops. Manures con-
taining nitrogen include sulphate
of ammonia, nitrate of soda,
dried blood, blood and bone,
fowl, sheep and stable manure.
A 10-year-old tree needs 81b. of
sulphate of ammonia a year or
its equivalent. The nitrogen
content of this quantity equals
151 b. of dried blood, 241 b. of
blood and bone, 1001 b. of fowl
manure or 2cwt. to 3cwt. of
stable manure. Requirements of
younger trees will be less, and
can be scaled down according to
age.
Keep the fertiliser away from
the trunk and foliage and spread
it evenly; a heavy concentra-
tion in one spot will burn the
roots. If there are many trees
the leguminous crop is the
cheapest method of fertilising.
Best are field-peas, vetches,
clovers, burr medic or lucerne.
Turned in they’ll confer a double
benefit' supplying nitrogen from
the roots and organic matter
from the foliage.
Hints for the Farm.
“Sarina”: House-flies breed
quickly in horse-manure during
warm months. Sweep the stable
manure into heaps frequently,
and, if left in heaps to rot into
compost, spray or water it with
a weak solution of borax to dis-
courage the flies.
“Bunda”: Australian subter-
ranean-clover is being used by
Americans to restore eroded hill-
sides. First grown in Oregon in
1940, it has spread from Texas
to the Atlantic, arid the Ameri-
cans are impressed by its value
as a fodder, its hardiness and
ability to withstand cold down
to 20 below zero. Supplies of
U.S.-grown seed are far too small
to meet the demand, and there
is probably a market for Aus-
tralian seed.
“Bill C.”: When treating
strangles, isolate the affected
horse and apply hot packs often
to bring the abscesses to a head,
when it should be lanced and
drained of pus. Give the nag
sulphanilimide in honey, 2oz. the
first day, and loz. on each of
the next two days. This will
usually hasten recovery, and
eliminate the risk of a simple
case of strangles becoming com-
plicated.
“K.J.T.”: Red on the wings
of good Ancona male birds is an
excellent point as far as breeding
is concerned. Such males pro-
duce very sound-colored pullets.
Although a defect in the show
pen, it is not that serious if the
bird is otherwise good. Some-
times only a rare feather is
carried and not easily noticed. I
have noted that the less a bird is
tipped the more red it carries on
the wing-bows. If the males
which are lacking in tippings are
mated to the very heavily-tipped
females, all things being equal,
they should produce good ex-
hibition specimens.
“M.”: To be effective against
tomato-moth dusting or spray-
ing has to be regularly applied.
For dusting use a 50 p.c. lead-
arsenate powder; for a spray
ioz. lead-arsenate powder or
loz. lead-arsenate paste in a gal-
lon of water. Apply every 10
to 14 days.
“Sarina”: Weedy, valueless
grazing paddocks are usually the
result of overstocking. In some
districts soil erosion occurs when
the natural grasses are flogged
down, but elsewhere Nature pro-
tects the country against erosion
by putting down a carpet of
weeds that make no appeal to
stock. Once weeds become
firmly established in a grazing
paddock the normally sensible
practice of shifting stock period-
ically from one paddock to an-
other becomes dangerous. The
stock carry the weed-seeds from
one paddock to another until all
are infested.
“Myrr”: To make algae-pol-
luted dam water palatable to
stock use the bluestone treat-
ment. Mix loz. bluestone in a
gallon of water and use a pint
of the solution to each 1000
gallons of water. Repeat the
treatment if the water again
turns green.

from the continuous strain, and
his eyes felt as if they were
being drawn from their sockets.
At six o’clock Joe Pearce
came in and relieved the wheel.
He did it in his usual casual
fashion, simply saying:
“Righto, kid. I’ll take ’er
now. Still goin’ south and east?”
“Yes,” the boy said, moving
aside, “Sou’-east.”
He envied Joe’s calm indiffer-
ence to the gale. At the back
of his mind, during every
minute of his two hours at the
wheel, had been the awful fear
that he might let the ship swing
broadside on to the seas. And
then, as the previous helmsman
had so gloomily prophesied,
she’d go right over and drown
the lot of them.
Had he only known it, Joe
Pearce was anything but indif-
ferent. He knew the Noorlah’s
age, realised something of the
strain this terrific pounding was
subjecting her to and had a
horrible feeling that the end was
not very far off. If he lived to
come off watch at eight o’clock
he’d air his views in the
fo’c’sle, but he wasn’t going to
air them here with the chance
of the mate popping in at any
moment.
The boy timed his exit badly,
so that he was literally hurled
down a steeply-sloping deck out
of the wheelhouse. A burst of
flying spray greeted him, drench-
ing him, stinging his hands and
face as it rattled like solid hail
against the steelwork of the
bridge. It was daylight now, he
saw, a shrieking, desolate dawn
of howling wind, driving rain
and mountainous seas that
thundered over the fo’c’sle head
and swirled waist-deep along the
well-deck. Overhead the wildly-
gyrating masthead seemed to be
trying to tear strips out of the
low, racing, grey scud.
The whole scene was awe-
inspiring, it was terrifying. It
was incredible that the ship
could rise to the summits of
those towering, foam-capped
walls of water. Always he’d
looked on the Noorlah as an
ocean giant, but this morning
she looked frail and pitifully
small,, dwarfed by the awful
majesty of those mountainous
seas. ,
To stand there and watch all
the destroying forces of the ele-
ments hurl themselves on the
ship required a certain brand of
courage. Captain Bell and Mr.
Wilding were doing it, but the
boy couldn’t. He was terrified,
arid the knowledge of his own
fear made him miserable. Could
he have known that the out-
wardly calm Captain Bell was
feeling afraid for the safety of
his ship he would have felt
much less miserable. But know-
ing nothing of his captain’s
feelings he could only gain
some small comfort by remind-
ing himself he didn’t have to
stand there watching the scene.
He had a job to do —one that
would keep his mind fully occu-
pied.
It was a hazardous trip from
bridge to galley this morning.
The old Noorlah was doing her
best to hurl the boy clean over-
board, Grey-green water crashed
over the bulwarks along the
lower deck, menacing him, tear-
ing at his legs, swirling aft in a
frantic endeavor to drag him
along.
IN the galley the cook was
* raising his voice above the
thunder of seas, imploring
heaven and hell to witness his
plight. Dirty, coal-grimed water
sloshed around his shins, water
on which floated onions, bread,
saucepans and stray packages.
Seeing the boy clinging to his
door-jamb he snarled;
“What the ’ell do you want?”
“The captain’s tea, please,”
Willie said.
“The captain’s tea!” The
cook fairly screamed the words,
“The captain’s tea! Does ’e ex-
pect me to make ’im a nice
cuppa tea when I’m bloody near
drownin’ in me own galley? Did
’e ’ave the nerve ter send yer
down for tea on a mornin’ like
this?”
“No,” the boy admitted
nervously. “I just thought . .
“Oh! So you just thought!”
Suddenly the sarcasm gave way
to a grudging admiration. The
cook nodded to a large boiler
securely wedged in a corner of
the stove, “I got some tea made,
kid, but y’ can’t take it up top-
side in this weather. Not a
’ope.” And then, noting the
crestfallen look on the boy’s
face, “Listen, kid. I’ll put it in
a billy for'y’ and jamb a lid on
so’s the wind won’t blow it out.”
He did that, thrusting the billy
and two enamel mugs into the
boy’s left hand. “ ’Old ’em like
that,” he ordered. “Keep the
other ’and free, one for y’self
and one for the owners. And
watch out y’ don’t get washed
overboard,” he finished, relaps-
ing into his old snarl. “I don’t
want t’ lose me billy.”
With only one hand to spare,
it was more difficult going back.
At all costs the precious tea
had to be guarded. The boy was
almost at the top of the bridge
ladder when the disaster oc-
curred. The Noorlah was climb-
ing out of a trough when sud-
denly, as if tired of the effort,
she stopped and allowed the
full weight of a sea to topple
aboard. It forced her bows
down and flung her, shuddering
under the impact, almost on her
beam-ends. The unexpected
suddenness of it upset the boy’s
balance. With two hands he
might have saved himself, but
there was the tea to be saved.
He overbalanced, lost his grip
of the rail and toppled back-
wards. Still grasping the precious
billy of tea, he crashed down on
to the steel deck.
BOTH Master and mate saw
him go. Mr, Wilding was
down the ladder in a flash. He
had one strong arm around the
boy before the hungry, swirling
sea could carry him over the
side. Above him he could see
Captain Bell furiously waving
an arm and pointing. The Old
Man’s mouth was opening and
shutting, too. Evidently he was
shouting something, but Mr.
Wilding could hear nothing but
the howling of the wind and the
roar of the seas. He guessed
that Captain Bell was trying to
tell him to take the boy into the
nearest shelter, which was the
captain’s own cabin. Although
the door was only a few feet
away, Mr. Wilding found it no
easy task to get the limp form
inside and lift it on to the neatly-
made-up bunk.
There was little more he could
do. His knowledge of first aid
was slight, and the boy was ob-
viously badly injured. He
climbed to the bridge and,
working his way to Captain
Bell’s side, roared: “You—
better look. Seems —bad. I’ll —
stay —here.”*
Captain Bell nodded and eased
himself down the ladder. Like
most old-time Masters, he had a
rough working knowledge of
medicine and surgery. There was
nothing he could do on the
bridge that Mr, Wilding
couldn’t do, but he might be
able to do something for the
boy. Once inside his own cabin
he shed his oilskins and stepped
swiftly to the bunk.
THE boy lay on his back.
Water dripped from his
face and hair, forming an ever-
widening patch on the pillow, it
soaked from his clothes into the
blankets and oozed through the
lacings of his boots. His wet
hair was plastered down over his
forehead and his deep brown
eyes were wide open. They
seemed to beg Captain Bell’s
forgiveness for spoiling his nice
clean bunk and for losing his
precious tea.
On the bridge Captain Bell
had felt powerless to do any-
thing for the safety of his ship.
Down here he quickly realised
he was utterly useless. There
was nothing he could do. Very
gently he smoothed the wet hair
back from the forehead and
closed the appealing eyes. He
turned hurriedly away, then
struggled into his oilskins and
climbed back to the bridge.
They buried William Darnell
next day. He, the youngest and
most insignificant member of
the crew, had become, through
death, the most important figure
on board —even more important
than Captain Bell, who now
stood bare-headed beside the
small bundle so neatly sewn up
in canvas and draped with the
Red Ensign. In life the boy had
gone about his duties practically
unnoticed. In death he made
his presence felt throughout the
entire ship. To the men
gathered for the service on the
for’ard well-deck he was more
vividly alive than he had been
during his whole time on board.
They remembered or invented
countless small incidents of his
seagoing career.
The cook, who had so con-
sistently abused him, now de-
rived a morbid pleasure from
taking the whole blame for the
boy’s death.
“It’s my fault,” he kept say-
ing, wiping his nose with the
back of his hand. “I shouldn’t
’ave give ’im that tea.”
THE very weather was making
its apologies. The cyclone
had moved on leaving behind
it a long swell on which the bat-
tered, rust-stained old Noorlah,
with engines stopped, lay rolling
slowly and easily. Instead of
range upon range of jagged grey
mountains, the Pacific appeared
as a series of orderly, gently-
sloping blue hills. It was as if
by their very gentleness both
ship and sea were trying to
atone for the shameful thing
they had done. The wind that
had howled and shrieked for
two days now moved only as a
hushed breeze that slowly
wafted the few remaining clouds
from a blue sky.
Captain Bell was not a man
of words. He had never con-
ducted a burial at sea before,
and he had no prayer-book to
guide him. The knowledge of
his shortcomings worried him.
A well-run ship, he felt, should
possess a prayer-book, and a
competent Master should know
how to conduct a service such
as this. At heart a senti-
mentalist, he had been deeply
moved by this tragedy, too
deeply moved to talk about it.
Still, he must say something.
The men obviously expected it
of him.
He squared his broad shoul-
ders and stepped forward, plac-
ing one hand on the plank on
which the small body lay.
4 ‘ K A EN,” he said, clearing
i his throat noisily, “we
stand here to pay tribute to our
late shipmate, William Darnell,
an able-seaman in the truest
sense of the word. He died
carrying out his duty as he saw
it, under conditions that would
have bluffed a hardened seaman.
There’s nothing more I can say,
except this—when I die I’d be a
proud man if my shipmates
could say ‘He was as game a
man as young Bill’ ”
A faint gust of wind eddied
under the flag, fluttering it and
bellying it upwards. To the
silent watchers it was as if the
small, still figure beneath it had
attempted to sit up and thank his
captain. Not in words, of
course —even in life the boy
would not have attempted that
—but with an expression of
gratitude in those big brown
eyes, like Able-seaman Pearce’s
spaniel acknowledging a pat.
Captain Bell coughed again
and stepped back.
“We therefore commit his
body to the deep,” he finished
quietly.

No State-owned pubs for me !
For there may be no leaning on

And singing merrily.
When such a game as throwing

How shall we know whose turn

No sounds of cheer will mingle

I’ll stay at home.

“One of Moscow’s most popular
operas is ‘Lady Macbeth of Mzensk,’
in which the composer, Shostakovich,
‘seeking to interpret the characters
from the Soviet point of view, justifies
in every way the actions of the
heroine, Katerina Lvovna, in murder-
ing her husband, father-in-law and
young nephew.’ In the opera a corpse
is located by the smell, thus breaking
up a wedding-dinner.”
“The Merry Wives of Nijni
Novgorod,” the latest master-
piece by the famous Soviet com-
poser Ivan Itchibak, had evoked
tremendous enthusiasm at its
premiere.
The Pink September Theatre
presented a brilliant spectacle.
In the royal box sat one of
Joe’s 17 doubles, surrounded by
heavily-armed guards to make
it look dinkum. In other boxes
high party officials sat with their
favorite concubines, the clear
American bullet-proof glass
causing them no inconvenience.
The real Joe, demonstrating
how, in contradistinction to the
wretched English monarch, he
was able to move about freely
among his loving subjects, sat
in his special secret reinforced-
concrete well, from which he
viewed the opera with his peri-
scope.
The workers, under their
guards, had filed in to their
adzed-hardwood seats silently.
This not because of any heavy
pile carpets on the floor ; it was
simply because their feet were
encased in the usual hessian
bags owing to the fact that there
were only enough leather boots
being produced to satisfy the
needs of party officials. During
the two-hour harangue by re-
lays of political commissars on
party propaganda to which they
were subjected prior to curtaih-
rise, the happy workers silently
speculated as to which of Joe’s
doubles, the one in the box was.
The Overture was striking. It
was scored for seven Chinese
gongs, eight riveting-machines,
nine klaxon horns, three wind
machines, 12 blurtophones,
three Soviet-type bagpipes, two
circular-saws, a steam-hammer
and an alto clarinet.
At its conclusion the composer
was brought forward and, after
being thoroughly searched by
several N.K.V.D. men, was
ushered into the royal box,
where Joe conferred on him the
order of Hero of the Soviet
Union for bringing new honor to
Soviet music by achieving 17
discords in the first three
measures. The audience didn’t
need to be so decorated —they
were all heroes, having just
listened to it.
As the opera unfolded it
demonstrated not only the bril-
liant originality and daring of
the text, which was by the or-
ganising secretary of the Union
of Collectivised Offal Pickers,
but that this was music which
engendered deep cogitation
among the workers as to whether
it is abstract music, objective
music, post-vorticist music or
music at all.
The story had that deep sim-
plicity which perfectly reflected
the Soviet way of life and the
early struggles of the heroic pro-
letariat against their savage capi-
talist masters.
The time is 1916. The hero is
Ivan Falstaffoff, a serious-
minded Bolshevik revolutionary.
Mistress Pageov, wife of an
enormously wealthy manufac-
turer of wolfskin underpants in
“I've left my music behind
Nijni Novgorod, is converted by
her clandestine lover Falstaffoff
to the revolutionary idea. She
plans to soak her husband in,
petrol and throw a match at him,
but is frustrated by Mistress
Fordski, the idiot wife of Gregor,
the town hangman, who treach-
erously warns the capitalist of
her intentions. Pageov hires a
band of thugs to liquidate Fal-
staffoff, but when they come to
murder him Falstaffoff makes a
brilliant speech to them and con-
verts them also to the revolution.
The former thugs set out patrio-
tically to garrotte the capitalist
Pageov, who, however, escapes to
the Garterov Inn, in the main
street of the town. Here they
catch up with him and drag the
capitalistic octopus screaming
from his. vodka, and throw him
into a pothole in the road,
where he is drowned in the mud.
Mistress Pageov gives the factory
to the State, and it is now known
as the Happy Proletariat factory.
Falstaffoff is made Commissar
of the Collectivised Wolfskin
Underpants industry, and so
brilliant a success is he in this
post that at the end of the first
year of his administration the
losses are kept down to 1,250,000
roubles. The curtain falls with
Mistress Pageov promising to
share with his fancy ballerina
Falstaffoff’s affections, and they
take the oath to the party on a
copy of “Confessions of a City
Barmaid,” and with a final
clenched - fist salute
to an enormous
photo, of the Fiihrer
and the Communist-
party slogan:
“Murder for Ever!”
“Depravda’s”
music critic next day
finished off his pane-
gyric on the work on
a fitting note.
“The work,” he
wrote, “is distin-
guished, as all good
proletarian music
should be, first and
foremost by the com-
poser’s stout resist-
ance to the tempta-
tion to use such de-
generate capitalistic devices as
melody, harmony and rhythm.
There is no complacency about
Comrade Itchibak’s music. It
truly and vigorously reflects the
mentality of all Soviet peoples.
In particular the Intermezzo be-
tween the Ist and 2nd acts, in
which rail-grinding machines,
massed trombones, cymbals, air-
raid sirens and an oboe are deli-
cately used, is a magnificent
piece of orchestration of one of
M. Vyshinsky’s U.N.O. vetoes.
The clever text is a modernised
version of the famous play by
Wilhelmov Shakesperski, the
great 16th-century Rlissian play-
wright, whom the English auda-
ciously claim as their own!”

Mailman in the Gulf
Holidaying on a cattle-station 100
miles north of Normanton in the
Gulf of Carpentaria country, I met Jack
Harris, who carries the mails a distance
of roughly 200 miles to the surrounding
cattle-stations.
Jack’s turnout consists of an ancient
buggy and pair of horses, also well
seasoned. He has as assistant a strapping
young abo. in his twenties, named Jubilee.
Both seem to scorn the comfort
of overhead covering of any kind on
their buggy. How they endure the heat
and the wet in rainy seasons year after
year is a mystery,
Harris had his left arm amputated at
the biceps as the result of a driving
accident some years ago, and it is amaz-
ing how well he handles the team.
His itinerary: Leave Normanton at
4.30 a.m. on Thursday ; first stop at a
Delta outstation named Maggieville, 25
miles out to the north. Friday morning
leave for Glencoe about 25 miles away ;
Saturday at Miranda Downs on the road
between Sterling and Lotus Vale. He
passes Lotus Vale on Monday, arrives at
Delta station about noon, passes Myra-
vale station and camps on the Fitzmaurice
River Monday night. On Tuesday he
arrives back at Maggieville about noon
and finally reaches Normanton on Tues-
day night. Wednesday is spent collecting
mail and supplies and snatching a rest
before starting out again on Thursday
morning.
In the “wet,” when the creeks and
rivers are flooding the country, Harris is
in constant danger. Five miles out from
Normanton he has to cross Wills Creek,
20 miles further on he crosses Walker’s
Creek, where the sharks come up from
the Gulf and crocodiles are on the other
side of the crossing. Sixteen miles further
on he crosses the Fitzmaurice River.
Another six miles to Six Mile Creek, five
miles to Smithbura River, two miles to
Snake Creek, one on to Garden Creek
and, three miles ahead. Cattle Creek. All
these streams go to make up the Delta
country. When the rivers and creeks are
in flood crocodiles make their way for
miles inland, and the country is infested
with snakes.
Sometimes it is necessary to take the
mail and supplies over in packs wrapped
in tarpaulins and pulled across with ropes
after Jack or Jubilee has swum the rivers.
Each day, on an average, Harris does
roughly 25 miles. The station-folk look
forward to his arrival, and welcome him
with that true Gulf-country hospitality.—
Rex McPhail Wilson (Vic.).
Me and Posterity
Once I lived in a house and could slam
a door or leave a tap running if I wanted
to —the results were my worry. War
came and I joined up. From houses I
regressed to tents, from tents to slit
trenches in the sand and from those to
slimy, slushy bivouacs in the steaming
jungle—all this to preserve my house for
me and posterity.
Eventually I graduated from the
slush through sac-sac hospital wards, to
convalescent-depot huts to the niceties
of civilisation and to the house again.
But not my house —some other joker had
got that while I was away. This time a
house with my wife and her parents and
her brother and his wife. Now we, the
wife and I, and her brother and his wife
have kids and the joint’s a bit confused.
But we’re lucky. The bloke who used
to live next door with his wife and kids
was chucked out to make way for a
family of Calwell migrants who even
yet cannot spikka da Eengleesh, For a
while the evicted ones roosted like fowls
with a neighbor, then they took a tent
on vacant land until the Council told
them to go away and make room for
some rubbish that had to be dumped
there. Last I heard he was living at his
mother’s place with two of his kids, while
his wife was living with her people with
the other youngster.
I’ve a much better idea. Since Calwell
is determined to import thousands of
migrants to compete for our houses, I’ve
given a thought to posterity’s chances —
which look a bit like those of the cele-
brated Buckley, My ancestors, so I’m
told, swung by their tails in the trees
and slept among the branches. From
now on my kids will have to learn to
climb as soon as they learn to walk.
After a couple of generations posterity
r.will have no need of houses and the
war we fought will all have been for
nothing.— Jindivick (N.S.W.).
Tasmanian Butchers
With the lifting of Federal controls
meat prices in Tasmania rose so
sharply that the State Government has
reimposed controls. Also, a general
price reduction, up to fourpence a pound
on some cuts of lamb, has been an-
nounced.
One disclosure was that some butchers
were deliberately not taking advantage
of facilities for importing cheaper
meat from the mainland. A master-
butcher gave as his defence of
high prices that people were willing to
pay them!
One dodge to evade the price-cuts lately
announced is underweight! sales. The
Minister in charge of prices promises
that, if there is any further trouble on
that score, butchers will be compelled to
issue a docket showing the weight, de-
scription and price of goods sold—a,
reform long overdue, and not only in
butchers’ shops.
Some Tasmanian butchers, who com-
plained so long and bitterly of ceiling
prices, have made a sorry spectacle of
themselves. —M, S. (Tas.),
Potatoes
“Red Earth” fB. 24/11/’4B) presented
a case for the growers, but what about
the retailers? They pay 245. l|d. a cwt.
for potatoes and, under the recent price
increase, sell them for 3d. a lb. An aver-
age bag of potatoes weighs approxi-
mately lewt. Iqr., which costs 30s. 2d.
In every bag there are at least six
pounds of dirt, plus the weight of the
bag, making eight pounds wastage. That
leaves a nett saleable weight of
lewt. 201 b., giving a return of 335. a bag,
a handsome gross profit of 2s. lOd. a
bag. Deduct the cost of paper-bags and
labor and you’ll find that potatoes are
being sold at a loss or, at best, even-
steven.
Those calculations are based on new
potatoes, where the percentage of wastage
is comparatively low. — Ebrius (N.S.W.).
Inadequate Railways
The Commonwealth Government’s
“kid-glove” attitude to Communists is the
main reason for Australia’s inadequate
railways (B. 1/12/’4B). The shortage of
iron and steel follows a carefully-pre-
pared Communist plan to delay the Vic-
torian and South Australian Railway
Commissioners’ bid to improve their
rolling stock and provide a better pas-
senger service.
The metal-trades dispute, which, run
by the Communist-controlled, Metal
Trades Federation, lasted most of
1946, put the Australian railway system
back to its pre-war level. Construction
and essential maintenance were at a
standstill,
“Dutigalla” is off the rails when he
blames the Railway Departments for not
“ Don't tell me there"s another inhabitant!”
providing dining-cars on the Adelaide-
Melbourne run. That is part of a sound
scheme to reduce the engine-load and
conserve the coal “allowed” by the
Communist-dominated Miners’ Federa-
tion,
For nearly two years the Victorian and
South Australian Railway Departments
have worked on a new express. Con-
struction of the new sleepers and ordinary
cars is still unfinished. The sleepers will
use the American “roomette” and a very
modern double-sleeper of Australian de-
sign. All have been delayed by indus-
trial disturbances.
Lately the Victorian department sought
tenders from America for modern high-
powered diesel-electric locomotives for
passenger and freight work. This move
was “scrubbed” because of the dollar
shortage.
During the last three years the Vic-
torian department has converted 80 of
its locomotives to oil-burning in a des-
perate bid to save coal. Chairman of
the Victorian Commissioners, Norman
Harris, even donned overalls and took
the engines on tests.
If the railway heads could only get
some co-operation from the Federal
Government they would soon have a fine
service. But as long as Communists are
allowed to control coal and the heavy-
metal industries there’s not much hope
for improvement. Waddlin’ Willie

Misplaced Charity
While charitable organisations are
hard-pressed for funds to carry out their
work, the offer by John Wren, Mel-
bourne’s “millionaire sportsman,” of £1
per run (With a £2OO minimum) scored
by Don Bradman in his testimonial match
is misplaced charity indeed.
Bradman, an Adelaide stockbroker and
the greatest cricketer of our age, playing
as an amateur, recently led an Australian
touring side, members of which received
over £9OO as their cut from the proceeds
of the tour. As he is expected to receive
something like £lO,OOO as the result of his
testimonial match it is doubtful if he is
in dire need of any assistance from Mr.
Wren.
It would have been a better gesture had
the money derived from Bradman’s
innings in the testimonial match been
earmarked for a charitable institution,
particularly the Red Cross, which, while
engaged on the sterling work of caring
for convalescent ex-servicemen as well as
civilians, faces a loss of over £450,000
for the last year.— Aramack (N.S.W.).
“Luxury Liners”
When Britain’s “Export or Die” cam-
paign had been under way for a year one
of her leading industrialists summed up
the mistakes which had been made by
saying that too many high-priced luxury
goods had been turned out for export,
and not enough things for which there
was always a sound demand—tools,
machinery and vehicles. That sort of
thing is still going on, and not only in
Britain —too many people are making or
building things which only a few can
use, instead of catering for the needs of
those on smaller incomes.
Cars are an example. There are far too
many luxury jobs when the world is cry-
ing out for modern counterparts of the
Dodge, Chev, and Ford of 20 years ago—
something to cater for the man with the
small income. We don’t need any more
“luxury” hotels, either, although plans
have been drawn for them to be built as
soon as materials are available, but we do
need scores of buildings of the modern
hostel type with a self-serve cafeteria so
as to cut down staff and charges.
This concentration on catering for the
wealthy, instead of on the much bigger
market available in the low-income
groups, is all the more incomprehensible
when one considers a few examples.
People still sneer at Butlin’s Holiday
Camps in Britain, but their success is one
of the post-war business sensations. They
cater for Mr. and. Mrs. Ramsbottom and
Young Albert. By producing the world’s
first cheap cars Henry Ford built up one
of the world’s biggest businesses. Ameri-
can “Motels” catering for the travelling
motorist and his car on self-service lines
are another example. So is the modern
cargo-vessel which takes a few passengers
at low rates. The always-crowded Aus-
tralian tourist buses are yet another
example.
Not until we start to cater for the small
incomes again will we return to common-
sense and conditions known as “normal
times.” — Bogaduck (S.A.).
Amateur Radio Licences
“Blue” tickets received by amateur
radio-operators for breaches of the Wire-
less Act (B. 8/12/’4B) are not pinprick-
ing.
“Hadit’s” claim that the advisory com-
mittees include youths who “dwell on”
old-timers is ridiculous. All are experi-
enced technical men, despite their com-
parative youth.
Perhaps some of “Hadit’s” brother
radio amateurs have received “blue”
tickets, and because they have had years
of operating they immediately blame
members of the advisory committee be-
cause some members are their juniors.
The old-timers are keen experimenters,
and many are up to all the tricks of the
game. Years of experience and operating
on amateur radio bands have taught them
that breaches of regulations give them a
louder signal the other side of the world,
although possibly lacking in quality and
causing a lot of local interference.
Many of the worst signals on the
amateur radio bands come from experi-
enced men. Overmodulation, key clicks
and off-frequency modulation are not un-
common among pre-war amateurs on the
air today.— Nejos (Vic.).
Liberal Policy
If the Liberal party is to take advantage
of a possible swing against the Labor
party at the next elections it will have to
adopt a liberal policy. Most Australians
depend upon private enterprise for
security, and it behoves the Liberals, as
sponsors of private enterprise, to come
out with a positive policy to keep our
people at work during any depression.
The conservative policy of reducing
taxation during a boom and taxing all
avenues during a slump to avoid deficits
should be reversed. Liberal policy should
be to build up reserves in times of plenty
to be used to limit deflation when busi-
ness is difficult. Liberals should admit
at once that public works are necessary
to assist private enterprise in giving full
employment and assuring purchasing-
power on the home market for Australian
goods when world markets slump.
If they have not the courage to do this,
the mantle of Liberalism will fall on the
Labor party and the swing may not be as
anticipated.—A. T. Ockery (N.S.W.).
From Smoke to Smother
The review of Douglas Reed’s From
Smoke to Smother (B. 27/10/’4B) will
bear elaboration. If Reed were merely an
alarmist or propounder of some new
minority political creed with an axe to
grind, his book would be suspect. But he
is not. His reputation as an international
observer is sound.
Reed names Communism and political
Zionism as the two new enemies already
working together for a common end.
With disturbing logic he links those two
creeds in history and in “common man-
agement.” He leaves no doubt that it
is Zionists, or the group behind them,
who are seeking anarchism and the over-
throw of Christianity.
Almost every day news dispatches
from overseas carry depressing confirma-
tion of the theory Reed has outlined.
He warned (in April last) that following
the British withdrawal from Palestine
there would be a murder or similar inci-
dent to justify the creation of an Inter-
national force by U.N.O. The murder of
Count Bernadotte has had precisely this
result.
There was an item in “Dragnet Digest”
(B. 27/10/’48);
For the benefit of “quiz-masters,”
Brigadier Glubb has not retired, as recently
stated.; he returned to Transjordan last
month after a month’s leave in England.
Before returning he adjured the U.S. and
Britain to watch their interests in the Middle
East because, he said, the Soviet Union was
supporting Israel in an attempt to gain
control of the whole area. He asserted that
arms bought with American money were
being smuggled into Israel from behind the
Iron Curtain and that Jewish youths were
receiving military training in the Soviet
Union and adjoining countries.
After reading the book the reader is
forced to the conclusion that Reed is
mad, has a fanatical hatred of Zionists,
or that he is warning the Christian demo-
cratic world of the evils and perils which
lie ahead. It is difficult to reach any but
the last conclusion. I. D. H. McD.

movement, and, in the case of “Swan
Lake,” they can get the variety of line
that is in Tschaikowsky’s music into their
gyrations so that the observer can some-
times sit, not consciously knowing
whether he is listening or looking.
What they seem to fall down on is the
visual aspect. Tschaikowsky’s music in
“Swan Lake” has, so to speak, the accent
of nature, but if the forest and lake set-
ting used by the Ballet Rambert had any
accent, it was of a technical college.
Similarly the “Concerto Buriesco” of
Walter Gore had pictorial drivel for
scenery.
The only ballet into which the eye sank
with some degree of pleasure was this
“Bar aux Folies Bergeres” to the choreo-
graphy of Ninette de Valois and Chabrier’s
music. The decor was by William
Chappell “after Manet.” Manet was a
great painter who did get the accent of
nature into his pictures, and Mr. Chappell
has copied the tonal scheme of his famous
painting more or less exactly. He has
even done it in the costumes.
The result is surprising. Everything
falls into its right plane, the dancers
don’t get muddled up with their back-
ground, and even the fierce light which
beats upon the stage from J.C.W.’s
modern electric-light plant can’t alto-
gether spoil the illusion.
There is a tip here for decorists. All
they need do is give up trying to be so
original, and, if they want a lake, forest,
cafe interior or street of houses, go
humbly to some great painting—a Titian,
a Velasquez or a Rembrandt —and copy
the tonal system. Then their decor would
have some of the quality of the music
and the dancing and an audience’s eye
wouldn’t be so offended.
The Kiwis.
The Kiwis, the band of New Zealand
Diggers who invaded Melbourne Comedy
on December 21, 1946, with an official
expectation of life of 12 weeks, are, to
the unfeigned astonishment of themselves
and the profession, still in occupation of
that playhouse and still playing to full
houses. Serried ranks of heads, like cab-
bages in a market-garden, were gazing at
their fourth programme of the season
the other evening Earlier programmes
were litM S famous battlefields with
which the Kiwis had had acquaintance.
This one is entitled “Medley.” Ingredi-
ents of the mixture are Ces Morris, an
extremely clever juggler, Phil Jay, a Lady
with a Past whose sad story would bring
tpars tn the eves of a brass monkey, and
Terry Vaughan and his orchestra, which
dishes un anything from jazz to Tschai-
kowskv P with a virtuosity which only
Armv rnnVs mnld eaual Sarge iokes be-

looks and dances more or less like a
ballerina, while Wally Proctor sings
“Santa Lucia” in a voice that seems to
have received its training in the conser-
vatorium of the drill-hall.
Although the Melbourne Town Hall
was full for the A.B.C.’s performance of
“Messiah,” the audience consisted of
officials, critics, technicians and a few odd
individuals. The rest of the building was
packed with 1400 choristers where the
AB.C. orchestra hadn’t been poked in.
There was no rehearsal, and whether
Handel would have been as pleased as
the A B.C. with the performance is a
moot question. It was a case of 70
against 1400, and it a miracle of
some consequence that diminutive Joseph
Post maintained any degree of balance be-
tween the choral giant and the orchestral
midget. Nevertheless he did so, and
some superb effects resulted, especially in
the Allelujah. One unexpected feature
was the clarity of the diction. Betty
Fretwell’s pure soprano soared above the
tumult in “I Know That My Redeemer
Liveth,” and Morris Williams, bass, gave
a brilliant rendering of “Why Do the
xrofnnc?”

Melbourne’s annual outburst of Christ-
mas.card exhibitions this season broke all
previous records. The Sedon Galleries
came out with their usual display of oils
and watercolors by leading Australian
painters, dead and living. John Loxton
filled the Athenaeum with watercolor
landscapes painted m terms of the smooth
formula of Harold Herbert and con-
cerned with the same subjects. He was
succeeded by John Morrissey who pays
him the compliment of delicate imitation.
The walls of the Velasquez have been
crowded with Dick Oyenden s oils, heavy
in places but sometimes catching the
accent of Nature, as in Passing Shower,
San Remo. Max Casey and H. S. Kur-
ban have been sharing the accommoda-
tion at Kozmmskys and the Australian
tradition-their pictures are as like as
peas from the same pod. Sybfi Craig
is being experimental at George s—flat
patterns alternate with tonal painting in
her array of still-hfe. Julius Wentcher s
illustrations of Homer s Iliad at the Mel-
bourne Book Club exploit a strange tech-
mque of rectangles and cross-lines to
describe battle-scenes and chariot-races.
The lines add nothing to the quality of
the drawing. Joshua McClelland has a
display of original 19th-century color
prints and portraits, views, sporting, and
costume subjects. The prints of “Epsom
Races” and “Bear Baiting at Charley’s
Theatre” should interest the cognoscenti.
Wheat Boom in Queensland
Up on the Darling Downs they are
telling El Dorado stories about fortunes
made by wheatgrowers this season. With
a harvest of 13,000,000 bushels and wheat
still pouring in, Queensland has had a
record year. Most of it has come out of
the Downs, with the result that land that
even might grow wheat is unbuyable.
Dairymen are turning to wheat because it
pays as well and isn’t such hard work,
transport is overloaded, rail depots
through the wheat-belt are overflowing,
and for the first time the wheatmen are
considering silos seriously.
Queensland had not hitherto rated high
in Australian wheat production, but if the
boom continues for another year or two
the output of this State will become an
important contribution to the world’s
food resources. A lot more land will go
under wheat on the Downs next year;
with growers claiming up to 19 bushels to
the acre and averaging about 12, it’s not
surprising that big cheques are going into
bank accounts in every tiny wheat town-
ship, or that the Downs at the moment is
a land of smiles.
One farmer in a big way took £48,000
from his wheatfields this season. A lad
of 17, given a property by his father, took
out £7500 in clear profit. Two young
soldiers who managed to buy some land
a couple of years ago at £2 10s. an acre
were offered £8 10s. an acre after it had
been ploughed.
The richness of this Downs soil is
shown in returns from other farming
ventures. In a not-exceptional month a
dairyman received a milk-cheque in
October for £3OO. Another took £lOOO
from sunflower seeds.
Still, some of the more thoughtful
people on the Downs are not altogether
happy about the present trend. For
many years the emphasis has been on
closer settlement; the average size of
holdings is 500-600 acres, with a basic
trend towards even smaller subdivision
which the remarkable productivity of the
soil makes possible.
Now it is seen that the wheat boom
may become the enemy of closer settle-
ment. Some Downsmen fear that the
turn towards wheat may halt the process
of subdivision, turning men’s eyes in-
stead towards larger holdings again. It
is clear enough, even to the uninstructed
eye, that the true function of the Darling
Downs in Australian life is to hold a large
indigenous population.
Behind the boom, too, these folk see
the shadow of the droughts of yesterday
and tomorrow, as well as the ruinous
price-collapses which have almost
wrecked the wheat industry in the past.
They hope for a future for the Downs
based on solid settlement, rather than on
the gambling possibilities of wheat. That
■i& rsh y there are thoughtful eyes behind
some of the smiles. But nothing at this
stage can divert the main focus of atten-
tion from the rich harvest and the hand-
some cheques.*— Dee (Q.).
Road Safety
In the three years ended June 30, 1948,
3868 people were killed and 69,034 in-
jured in motor accidents in Australia.
Our population cannot stand this waste,
but propaganda of the Australian Road
Safety Council will not arrest it. You
cannot tell Australians these things or,
as gas and water shortages have shown,
depend on any honor system. The driver
who takes risks and gets away with it
thinks safety-first talk is pointless.
We need legislation providing a heavy
minimum penalty of imprisonment with-
out the option. Fines are no deterrent,
offenders are making so much money now
that the few notes they are fined are no
punishment. They should be debarred
from the good money-making times we
are enjoying. A few will have to go to
prison before the majority will wake up
to the fact that it is road safety or clink.
It would be much better to give a man 12
months this week for speeding than five
years for manslaughter a month hence.
The reckless or careless driver is today’s
“Public Enemy.” If the fatalities over
the last three years include 3000 workers
Australia is losing six million man hours
a year in industry. No Communist-in-
spired strike has put such a mark on
Australian production; certainly none
has caused the personal sorrow and suf-
fering.—Noonamah (N.S.W.).
Country Towns
Though many old-established country
towns have shown signs of expansion by
the addition of new dwellings and a few
small secondary industries, their popula-
tions have either remained static or de-
clined. The main reason is the decreasing
birthrate, houses that once sheltered
families of up to a dozen children now
holding only two or three.
But there is another reason —a
local centralisation by which a town
proper expands at the expense of its
immediate surroundings. Years ago.
dozens of homes, situated on a few acres
of land, could be found within three or
four miles of most old towns. The nearest
post-office was the address of those small
holders who were included in the popula-
tion of the nearest town.
That type of home has almost disap-
peared ; the little holdings have been
absorbed into larger properties or
abandoned. The pioneering spirit that
“Cant get him to take it without orange-juice!”
took men “out a bit,” where they could
supplement their weekly wages with pro-
duce from their small blocks, has gone.
The new generations have shifted
either to the city or into town.
Thus, when a new house is built
or an old one shifted into a town today
it does not, in many cases, represent an
increase. Often it only takes the place
of one of the many that once existed two
or three miles out.
Those old-timers had the right idea.
On their farmlets they ran a cow or two,
kept pigs, poultry and a few sheep, got
their own firewood, had a big garden and,
in many cases, a small orchard. It was
half their living.—L. P. (Vic,).
Into the Zoo
In the last few weeks the authorities
concerned with protecting Victorian fauna
have become extraordinarily concerned
over the welfare of emus, wallabies and
koalas in private custody, their particular
target being the Wild Life Sanctuary at
Balwyn, one of Melbourne’s outer
suburbs. It is kept by an animal-lover
named Maughan and visited by thousands
of kids and their parents. Maughan keeps
donkeys, camels and birds and beasts of
all sorts roaming free over a wide ex-
panse of woodland where common barn-
door fowls root round with gorgeous
pheasants.
Koalas, kept in large enclosures* are
said to be the only ones which have ever
bred in captivity. They are the delight
of the children and all look well-fed and
happy.
In the course of the years, however,
Maughan has exceeded the range of the
official permit, since the animals, being
generally healthy and well looked after,
can’t help reproducing their kind. At
the latest finding he is likely to have
his surplus population seized, and, as it
can’t be released, the only place for it is
the Melbourne Zoo, where most of the
animals look as bored, hopeless and
melancholy as civil servants waiting for
superannuation.— Melbn (Vic.).
Root of the Matter
There are ways of getting round the
high postage-rates on Food for Britain
parcels (B. 24/11/’4B). The Red Cross
accepts a sum equivalent to the cost of
the goods in a parcel, plus the address
of the person to whom it is to be sent.
The goods are shipped in bulk to Eng-
where they are made up into parcels
and dispatched from distributing centres.
Although you can’t actually dictate the
contents of parcels, you can be sure that
essential foodstuffs are going’ to the right
places.— Ebrius (N.S.W.).
As a pendant to that criticism by Dame
Enid Lyons (B. 10/11/’4B) that none of
Communists with whom we are familiar
looks poverty-stricken or preaches his
gospel in the slums comes the testimony
of Bernard Newman, lecturer, writer and
traveller in Europe. He points out that
at the Italian elections in 1947 the
Commos did best not in the industrial
north-west or among the landless
peasantry, but in the comparatively pros-
perous provinces of Tuscany and Emilia
Romagna, where once the Fascists polled
ill greatest strength.—E. & O. E. (Tas.).
Complaints about conditions at the
lepsr hospital at Channel Island Mission
maKe me wonder why we persist in the
barbaric, medieval system of segregation.
Leprosy is not highly contagious nor has
it ev-r assumed epidemic form; present-
day revulsion towards the disease is a
survival from Biblical days. Isolation
may t*e necessary, but surely that can be
accoirplished in a hospital block without
resortng to some forbidding fortress
island.— Kay Veness (N.S.W.).
It’s people like “R.W.” (B. 24/11/’4B)
who, knowing little of what they’re talk-
ing about, do so much harm to the nurs-
ing profession. Trainees —not nursing
assistants —do no floor-scrubbing
although they might be required to mop
a small areh with disinfectant.
“R.W.” ever heard of “sesepsis”? Clean-
liness is the beginning of it. As for the
despised pan-carrying, I learned two very
important things as a nurse. First, obser-
vation of the stool is of very great im-
portance not only in nursing medical
cases, but also 'surgical ones. Secondly,
no nurse is ever too senior to carry a pan.
—Trained Nurse (Q.).
A vigorous policy is not necessarily a
meddlesome one (B. 24/11/’4B). If we,
for example, are to have a defence policy
at all, it must be based on either universal
or voluntary service. Failure by any
party to declare itself on this issue is
proof, not of Liberalism, but of moral
cowardice. Or take trade-union law.
Public opinion is gradually forcing Gov-
ernments to clarify their policy on this
matter ; why shouldn’t a prospective Gov-
ernment do the same? We don’t want
the Liberals, when they form a Govern-
ment, to tell us what we are to do, but
before we entrust them with power we
should know what, when the time comes,
they propose to do, — Magnoon (Q.).

A WENTY-FOUR "Caterpillar” Diesel Tractors are speeding the construction
ot the £5,000,000 Kingsford Smith Airport at Mascot, New South Wales,
shifting 9,000,000 yards of material at the rate of 25,000 to 30,000 tons per week.
Kingsford Smith Airport will be the largest in the Southern Hemisphere, covering
an area of approximately 2,000 acres, with runways up to 10,000 feet long and 300
feet wide to accommodate the world’s largest air liners.
The diversion of the Cook’s River into Botany Bay, one mile south of ks r : -
outlet, by cutting a channel 600 feet wide by 24 feet deep and 1\ n es b i- :
calls for the moving of 2,500,000 yards of earth. The balance of the 9,000.000
yards of material to be moved will be made up in raising the ’drome level by 9 feet
and filling in the existing river. No less than 6,000,000 yards will come from
the dredging of Botany Bay and 500,000 yards from the nearby sand dunes. The
bulk of this work will be done by "Caterpillar” Diesel D 6, D 7, and D 8 Track-
Type Tractors with cable-controlled Dozers, and No, 12 Diesel Motor Graders.
Operating in loose sand and on swampy ground under the most gruelling
conditions, the "Caterpillar” Diesel Tractors, with their rugged construction,
tremendous power and easy mobility, give the maximum of sustained traction
power, with the minimum of fuel consumption that makes "Caterpillar” a byword
for economy. Fitted with all-weather seals and filters that shut out the abrasive sand
and protect vital parts, replacements are reduced to the barest minimum.
To maintain the rate of excavation and increase output as the urgency of the job
demands, "Caterpillar” Diesel Traction and Earth-Moving Equipment help speed
still one more national project to a successful conclusion, economically and on time!
