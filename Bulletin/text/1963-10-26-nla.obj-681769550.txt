There’s no more exacting master than Tradition
The Yalumba tradition began with Samuel Smith who, in 1849, founded a vineyard to produce
wines equal to any in the world. A claret born of these concepts is Yalumba Galway Vintage.
Blended from Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz varieties, Galway Vintage is an elegant, yet
delightfully light, claret. Connoisseurs seek it out. Royal Show judges honour its quality. Galway
Vintage Claret, by Yalumba, is indeed worth asking for.

National Notebook
"An Unmitigated Boil of
Horror”
Sometime in late December, Joseph
Losey (a former Hollywood director
who left America after the McCarthy
investigations into Dream Factory poli-
tics, and has since vorked successfully
in England) will arrive with Dirk Bogarde
to make “Wake In Fright”, from the
much-praised novel by Australian Ken-
neth Cook about a Sydney softie who is
subjected to the hellish atmosphere of a
school in an industrial country town.
Somehow we expected Mr Cook to be
like his Bogardesque hero: rather sensi-
tive, perhaps a little wan, and easily
vulnerable. Surprisingly, he turned out
to be large, imperturbable, and impress-
ively bearded.
“The setting of the book is Broken
Hill, although that is never actually stat-
ed,” Cook said. “The place is an un-
mitigated boil of horror. The book pro-
vided a way of showing
the sense of horror in a
place where the suicide
rate is very high and
drinking is heavy. Per-
haps the most horrible
feature is the place’s
brash and aggressive
friendliness. It’s what happens in so
many Australian towns when you have
people living in conditions which were
not meant for a white man.
“I'm very pleased Losey is directing
the film version. I think he will be able
to create what I want —a subjective feel-
ing of terror, a highly personal vision
of a nightmare world.
“Evan Jones, the scriptwriter, has—
and this is most unusual —consulted with
me on every stage of the script. At
the moment we are in correspondence
over the various folk songs that crop up
in the novel.
“My wife Patricia has done two LP
recordings with Lionel Long, singing
folk-idiom songs which 1 have prepared,
based on original Australian folk music
themes on EMI label. It’s due in
November.” In answer to our question,
Mr Cook said, yes, he hoped the songs
would be featured on the music-track
of the film.
Kenneth Cook has published two other
books, makes educational films on insects
for children and scripts for the ABC.
He plans after the shooting of “Wake in
Fright” to head for Europe in a Rolls
Royce which he will drive for a chil-
dren’s travel film, to be used by the
ABC later. “And I hope it will be seen
by children all over the world,” he says.
Without Comment
A friend of ours went to a company
dinner recently where the guest
speaker was a clean-cut young American
who gave an address on the importance
of careful research in establishing market-
ing patterns. As an example, he told the
story of an American company which
produced the perfect ready cake mix
which, he said, was “run up on the flag-
pole to the tune of many millions of
dollars by the Madison Avenue boys and
pronounced good.” Unexpectedly sales
dropped and the sponsoring company
called in some of New York’s “top social
psychologists” who cross-sampled a num-
ber of young matrons by test-questioning
them under the influence of sodium pen-
tathal. The results showed, he said, that
most women regard making a cake as
similar to having a baby. They wanted to
feel they had a personal influence on the
end result. The cake mix company took
the hint. By scrambling
the instructions on the
outside of the packet they
made it more of a personal
effort for the housewife to
cook her ready-mix cake.
In short, he said, the
average housewife felt
that she was actually contributing some-
thing to the making of a cake. This
buoyant attitude was reflected in rapidly
increased sales.
Import
Sydney’s Phillip Theatre, after 10 years
at it, has learnt to estimate the size
and lasting power of its revue audiences
almost to the last chuckle. Having lost
audiences but gained prestige with “Be-
yond the Fringe”, it has picked up audi-
ences and a healthy bank balance with
three months of slapstick in “Do You
Mind”. The Phillip is spending part of
this on their first imported star since
Joyce Grenfell. She is Judith Stott who
starred in the London production of
“The Private Ear and The Public Eye”.
She will open in these two one-acters on
November 13. The producer Frank
Stevens is here, too.
Miss Stott, tiny with the fashionable
gamin face of the sixties, is a world away
from Miss Grenfell’s hockey-fields.
Much of her stage experience has been
Shakespeare or modern comedies with
practically the whole roll-call of the illus-
trious —Gielgud, Ashcroft and Edith
Evans—but her spiritual home is the
Royal Court Theatre, and her friends
are the bright young men of the ’sixties

—Albert Finney, John Osborne and

The Royal Court is her spiritual home
but although she has had offers to play
there, they have always clashed with
current engagements. Still she believes
that in spite of a freezing winter, a wet
summer, the Keeler case and the Great
Train Robbery—or perhaps because of
all these disasters —the theatre in Eng-
land is more lively than it has been for
a decade. “And we are making good
films and television now, too,” she said.
She doesn’t believe that “The Private
Ear and The Public Eye” breaks new
ground in the theatre but that the plays
are enormously funny. “They are a
delight to play and I have never for a
moment been bored in them,” she said.
Farewell Cazaly
death in Hobart of Roy Cazaly
at the age of 70 removed a man
whose name within his lifetime had
become part of the living Australian
language. Only days before his death,
boys who had never seen him were
shouting, “Up there, Cazaly”, as their
fathers had yelled the words as a battle-
cry in 1939-45.
“Cazza” first leaped to fame in the early
1920 s with towering marks for South
Melbourne in the Victorian Football
League. He later brought his flowing,
play-on style of Australian Rules to Tas-
mania, first as coach of City (in Laun-
ceston) and then with North Hobart and
New Town.
Cazaly returned to Victoria in 1936
to coach South Melbourne and then
Hawthorn. He was actively associated
with the game until he was 49. Going
back to Hobart after the war, he con-
tinued as a coach until 1952.
Slow T business
HPhe most spectacular sight in Sydney
A at present is undoubtedly the gigantic
vermilion cranes at the opera house site
lifting the first segments of the roof into
position. Building an opera house is
proving a slow and costly business, but
it seems that building opera audiences is
even slower. The Elizabethan Theatre
Trust’s 1963 opera season, in its progress
around Australia, will come to Sydney
this month. This year’s offerings are “La
Boheme”, “Faust”, “Fidelio” and “The
Marriage of Figaro”. However, the
executive director of the Trust, Stefan
Haag, admitted that box-office reaction
hasn't been quite what was expected.
The tw'o “pop” operas, “La Boheme”
and “Faust”, have not won as much
support as the other tw'o and the reason
is, he believes, that the public is so wed-
ded to the star system that it is attracted
by big names and not by the work itself.
“Today,” Haag said, “90 per cent of
opera seats are sold on the name of a
star, which makes opera too expensive
and also threatens artistic standards.”
He illustrated his point by a mythical
engagement of Joan Sutherland.
“We would then have the opportunity
to build a production round a great
artist,” he said. “And we would have
to charge £7 to £lO a seat if the
general artistic level of our perform-
ances were to reach any sort of standard.
“Or we might simply offer the public
Sutherland and not bother much about
the production. Then we might charge,
say, £5 a seat.”
Mr Haag believes that it is partly be-
cause of the effects of the star system
that opera today is battling to survive.
He gave Italy as an instance. “Before
the Second World War there were 43
permanent opera houses in Italy,” he
said. “Now there are only four.
“And in Germany if the subscription
system were to be given up the whole
operatic structure would collapse like a
house of cards.”
Admitting that this system was one
way of partially solving the enormous
economic problem that opera presented,
he said the Trust was considering intro-
ducing it in Australia.
Scooping the pool
who often regret their
ancestors’ thoughtless impulse in
founding Victoria have new reason for
bitterness at the ingratitude of the State
they nurtured. They remember the un-
happy affair of Tattersalls, the lottery
that was born in Tasmania in the late
19th century and was brought to matu-
rity in tolerant Hobart, only to be whisk-
ed off by the Victorians when they sud-
denly realised how much money a
government can make from a lottery.
Now Victoria has crowded in on
Tasmania's scallops, once found only in
D’Entrecasteaux Channel in the south-
east. Not only have the Victorians dis-
covered huge beds of scallops in Port
Phillip Bay, but they have enticed honest
Tasmanian fishermen to migrate across
the strait and teach the Port Phillip crews
how to dredge the scallops and split their
shells.
A dozen boats, each carrying three to
five men, have already sailed away. The
Tasmanian scallop season is closed, but
it’s open house in Victoria. Reports
filtering back to Hobart suggest that some
of the Victorians are unwilling to join
the Tasmanians in partnership. They
merely stand off and watch them, so that
they can learn their methods.
THE SALON
I'd like to preside, distingue and slit-
eyed,
Over a salon all glittery
Where painters, musicians and top
politicians
Rub a shoulder or two with the littery.
Reclining beneath a bronze statue
All gleaming with Brasso
I'd talk of Picasso,
Ah, touche, you aristocrat you!
Saying: Je suis enchantee to Tennessee’s
Auntee
My wit would have everyone reeling
My toilet would be just le dernier cri
And T.S. would find me appealing.
In an attitude tres elegantee
The salon I'd daze
With some madly chic phrase
Like: Ou est la plume de man tantee?
This brilliant assembly would soften, all
trembly,
At the impact of one of my smiles,
I’d display my jazz garters to sad
litterateurs
Till they'd all be a-roll in the aisles.

"AH that taEk about Labor's
defence policy


PLAIN ENGLISH
The Elections
11/HILE most elections are usually
" fought on a wider range of
issues at the finish than at the out-
set, present indications are that the
election set for November 30 will
be the first in Australian peace-time
history specifically sought by the
Government on the issues of foreign
policy and defence. In British
politics it has been said that govern-
ments have never won elections
on foreign policy issues although
they have sometimes lost them. The
Liberal-Country Party Government
hopes the reverse may be true of
this country where the Labor Party,
on vital matters captive to its ex-
treme Left wing, may lose the elec-
tion because of its incapacity to
carry into effect rational, united,
Australian policies on defence and
external affairs.
The three issues of Malaysia, the
nuclear free test zone and the US
signals base at North West Cape are
very serious ones. Whether they
are also popular remains to be seen.
In the instance of Malaysia the Op-
position, because of Left-wing sub-
version in its own ranks, clearly
failed to support the Government
on a matter of national defence and
commitment where a united front
was necessary. The notion of a
nuclear free zone for the Southern
Hemisphere is one that has an ap-
peal to many people who naturally
fear any extension of the nuclear
arms race to the area in which we
live. It totally ignores, however, the
realities of nuclear strategy.
nPHERE is at present no need to
A have nuclear deterrents in this
country. They can be of no use
to us. They can only offend and
aggravate our Asian neighbors and
invite them to seek nuclear weapons
from Russia or Red China. But this
is a vastly different thing from dec-
laring Australia a nuclear free zone.
In the event of nuclear war it may
be necessary for our survival, or
partial survival, for the US or Bri-
tain to launch nuclear weapons from
this country. To refuse to allow our
allies to do this because Australia
is a nuclear free zone is no guaran-
tee that our enemies will not launch
nuclear missiles at us. It may prove
an invitation. The Labor Party’s
attitude to the American base
at Exmouth is a demonstrable
absurdity. It is quite impossible
to expect that in the split-second
timing of a nuclear war that
the United States could accept
the principle of joint consultation
with an Australian Government.
Either we accept US aid in the only
possible terms it can be offered or
we do without it.
Nevertheless the Government’s
choice of defence and foreign policy
issues^ —although serious in them-
selves —seems to indicate a high
measure of confidence that the elec-
tors of the country will accept the
Government’s record and return it
to power. Many observers are not
so certain that this confidence is
justified. While our overseas
currency reserves are high,
while unemployment figures have
dropped to nearly insignificant
proportions, while development is
gathering momentum and prices
are more stable than they have been
for many years, many electors have
not forgotten the tough days of the
credit squeeze which Mr Calwell
and the Labor Party can be expected
to recall with all stops out. The
Prime Minister and the Government
will have to look carefully to a
defence of the Government’s eco-
nomic record and reassure voters
that future booms can be contained
without resorting to the tough
measures of November, 1960.

THIS AUSTRALIA
THE ELECTIONS - I
Is This to be Menzies’
Biggest Gamble?
A foreign policy election
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
SIR ROBERT
Confidence
At 68, his skin still healthily pink and
his well-brushed silvered mane thick
and vigorous, Prime Minister Sir Robert
Menzies last week embarked upon what
could be his largest (and last) gamble.
He has announced a general election
for the House of Representatives five
times since he came to power 14 years
ago. But when he announced that he
would fight this one primarily on inter-
national affairs he was defying tradition
and' doing something that has never been
attempted before in Australia in peace-
time trying to win a general election
on other than domestic issues.
A significant number of his followers,
including some whose past judgments
have proved sound, disagreed with his
assessment that the present was an op-
portune time to hold elections for a
House in which the Government has
existed for two years precariously but
effectively on a floor majority of one.
These followers believed (or hoped) that
the Government could win even without
an issue. But they would have preferred
to wait for events to provide them with
one which would have given them a
wider margin of certainty and which
they were confident would emerge during
the 12 months of life still left to Par-
liament.
But Menzies, to his credit, assumed
the responsibility that goes with leader-
ship. As he told the party meeting at
which he announced his intention to hold
an election on November 30, the decision
was his. He had weighed all the fac-
tors put before him. But it had been
he, and he alone, who had made the
final decision. Time now alone will show
whether the decision, and the judgment
on which he based it, was right or
wrong.
His choice of issues suggests two
things. He has a faith in the capacity
of the Australian voter for sophisticated
thinking when national survival is in-
volved. He believes that it has pene-
trated the national consciousness that
Australia is living in a world which has
changed vastly even in the two years
since 1961 when the last elections took
place. The issues he listed as those on
which the national interest demanded
that the elections should be fought were:
(1) The difference in approach be-
tween the Government and Labor to the
establishment of the United States’ radio
communications base at Exmouth Gulf.
(2) The difference in approach be-
tween the Government and Labor to
Malaysia, to the maintenance of whose
national integrity Australia, in partner-
ship with Britain, has pledged armed
support; and
(3) The Government’s opposition to
the establishment of a nuclear-free
Southern Hemisphere a concept
which the Labor Party is sponsoring
and pushing.
THhe domestic scene suggests that Men-
zies has some justification in seeking
to make foreign affairs the primary object
of consideration for the electors when
they pass their verdict on November 30.
The Government undoubtedly miscalcu-
lated with its economic measures of 1960
when it produced the unexpected em-
ployment difficulties which cost it its
record majority at the 1961 elections.
But on current employment figures
the Government has made amends in
that it has for all practical purposes re-
stored the full employment which it
maintained unbrokenly, and as an out-
come of deliberate policy, from 1949 to
1960.
Indications are that the immediate
years ahead are likely to be prosperous
and expansionary on the domestic side.
There are more likely to be labor short-
ages than labor excesses next year, and
this year's crop of school leavers should
be quickly assimilated into the work
force.
Production is increasing. The balance
of payments situation is healthy. Though
the cost level has been kept surpris-
ingly stable, the pace of expansion ap-
pears to be quickening. There are still
special problems (such as northern de-
velopment, the necessity for building up
secondary industry in Queensland to
lessen that' State’s dependence for em-
ployment of its work force upon season-
ally affected’ occupations, and the de-
veloping problem of how to balance
Australia’s need for overseas capital with
the desirability of keeping as much Aus-
tralian industry as possible within Aus-
tralian control).
These problems undoubtedly will and
should get an airing during the coming
campaign. But as far as local issues are
concerned, it would appear that Men-
zies is much better placed than he was in
1961, when even his traditional sup-
porters were grumbling against the un-
expected results of his economic re-
strictions.
There are very few real and basic
grievances Labor can exploit on the do-
mestic side, compared with 1961. All
it can do is to suggest, as Mr Calwell
has already begun to do that the Govern-
ment might recreate through its economic
policies the grievances that it conjured
into existence in 1961 as a consequence
of its 1960 economic programme.
To the extent that current prosperity is
self evident, Menzies will probably be
helped in his aim to keep the election
issues primarily on international affairs.
But he still has his problems. The dif-
ferences in approach between his gov-
ernment and Labor to Exmouth Gulf,
Malaysia and the nuclear-free Southern
Hemisphere are quite complex. They take
a lot of explaining. Menzies has the gift
for explaining an issue, simply and with
clarity; but this is going to tax even
him to the uttermost.
At a guess, I would say that Menzies
will probably use Exmouth Gulf and
Labor’s attitude towards it, and Aus-
tralia’s association with the United States,
to illustrate the difference in approach be-
tween the Government and Labor to
these difficult international arrangements,
with which Menzies believes Australia’s
future is inextricably bound up. Ex-
mouth Gulf lends itself to easier ex-
planation than either Malaysia or the
nuclear-free Southern Hemisphere,
though to some extent the nuclear-free
argument impinges on that of Exmouth
Gulf.
As the Government sees Exmouth
Gulf and its significance to Australia it
is a very simple problem. The United
States’ atomic might and its ability to
deploy this might in the Southern Hemis-
phere if the need arises is, in the Gov-
ernment's view, a far more effective
preventative against atomic attack than
any nuclear-free Southern Hemisphere
agreement, which would inevitably be


violated by powers hostile to Australia
if hostilities ever broke out.
The United States needs Exmouth
Gulf as a link in its communications
chain to deploy its atomic might if such
deployment ever became necessary.
Therefore it is in Australia’s self-in-
terest (the argument is that presence of
the base would give the United States
an added inducement to protect Aus-
tralia) to have the base established on
its territories.
To seek, as Labor does, joint control
by Australia with the United States in
the operation of the base would be to
diminish the effectiveness of the base as
a link in the United States’ deterrent
chain. In these days of swift delivery of
atomic missiles a deterrent remains a
deterrent only when a potential aggressor
is aware that reaction to his atomic at-
tack would be prompt and automatic.
The delay necessary for consultation be-
tween the United States and Australia
would remove the value of Exmouth
Gulf as a link in the deterrent chain.
Therefore, if Australia insisted upon this
condition, the United States would un-
doubtedly no longer see Exmouth Gulf
as having any value to it, either for con-
ventional purposes or as a link in the
deterrent chain.
Labor’s attitude is harder to explain.
Officially it accepts the principle of the
base, but acceptance is conditional on
Australia being given joint control. An
ALP Federal Conference (the ALP
Federal Conference is Labor’s supreme
policy-making body) decided this by the
narrow margin of . 19/17. But the vital
question is what happens if a Labor
Government comes to power, seeks to
re-negotiate the present agreement, and
fails (as seems certain) to get US agree-
ment to joint control. Will the United
States pull out, abandoning without com-
plaint whatever it has spent in establish-
ing the base, as it pulled out from
Manus Island shortly after the end of
World War II when the Chifley Labor
Government sought to extract from the
US administration of the day conditions
to which the US would not agree?
“No,” said Labor’s Right wing, which
is as firmly pro-American as the Men-
zies administration. “We shall ask the
US to re-negotiate the agreement. If
the US either won’t, or won’t agree to
joint control, then we shall have failed.
But that does not mean that the Ameri-
cans will have to go. We will honor the
agreement that exists between Australia
and the United States.
But there is a Left wing in the Labor
Party as well as a Right wing, and it
has had an almost unbroken record of
wins Federally since 1954. Its view is
quite simple. The Americans are the
war-mongers. China and Russia are the
world powers that want peace and that
can be trusted where the United States
cannot. (Interestingly, this line has not
varied much since the Russian-Chinese
ideological split, despite the accusations
Russia has made against the Chinese of
exporting Marxism by armed might). If
the United States will not agree to joint
control of Exmouth Gulf, then let the
Americans get out and go home.
HThe anti-American wing of the Labor
Party will insist upon the ALP Fed-
eral Conference decision being observed,
and as the decision was put through the
conference by the Right wing (with the
help of a defector from the Left wing’s
ranks) it is difficult to see how the Right
wing can successfully resist inplementing
a decision for which it was alone re-
sponsible.
As I see it, Menzies is attempting an
interesting experiment in seeking to have
an Australian election fought on foreign
affairs issues. It will be absorbing to see
if he can manage to have it fought on
those issues and whether his faith in
the sophistication of the Australian voter
is justified and he can succeed in in-
teresting, instead of mystifying, his audi-
ences with his explanations.
THE ELECTIONS II
The Two Key States
Vital " fringe ” seats in NSW and Queensland
FROM CORRESPONDENTS IN SYDNEY AND MELBOURNE
VTew South Wales is a key State,
together with Queensland, in the
coming elections. The big question in
NSW is just how many additional
electors will go on the rolls in the key
seats.
In the possible country swing seats
the situation is, as elsewhere in Aus-
tralia, fairly stable. The sprawling
electorate of Hume in southern NSW
was won last time by the in-out ALP
candidate lan Fuller, the storekeeper
from Tumut, who lost 101 electors
between the last elections and the end
of September. In Cowper, the former
North Coast bailiwick of Sir Earle Page,
in the same period the number of electors
dropped by 18.
The coming election will be won or
lost in the fringe metropolitan - rural
seats on the outskirts of Brisbane, Mel-
bourne and Sydney as much as in the
classic middle-class swing seats.
In NSW, ALP planners were talking
optimistically about two possible seats
last week Macarthur and Robertson,
both in the fringe classification. They
displayed some muted optimism about
Sir Garfield Barwick’s seat of Parra-
matta, and a touch of fantasy-hope about
Lowe, Mr. William McMahon's domain.
The Liberals put their hopes in a status
quo in Robertson, Macarthur and Parra-
matta, and in the prospects of regaining
Evans, lost by a Minister, Mr F. Osborne,
last time, and in St George, with a faint
hope of taking Parkes and Phillip.
There are high hopes in the Country
Party for Cowper, despite the fact that
the ALP man, Mr McGuren, has made
a good showing (extensive Common-
wealth flood mitigation subsidies an-
nounced last week were not unrelated
to this seat).
In the big Central Coast outer North-
ern Suburbs seat of Robertson the situa-
tion was interesting. Some ALP men
have claimed that the 1961 election was
lost in this seat rather than in Mr
Killen’s in Brisbane. That time the ALP
ran the same elderly man as it had run
for years without any thorough campaign
(he never crossed the Hawkesbury to
speak in the new suburbs past Hornsby
that form part of the seat). There the
number of electors has increased by
4000. A lot depends on the candidate
put up this time against the unspectacular
incumbent, Mr R. Dean.
The ALP candidate, Mr R. J. Brown,
was something of a surprise selection.
A miner's son from Kurri Kurri and now
a teacher, Mr Brown is also a Bachelor
of Economics. It was perhaps for this
reason that Gough Whitlam pushed him
so hard for selection.
The seat of Macarthur is an electoral
anomaly which runs from the industrial
outer Sydney suburb of St Marys through
the conservative countryside of Camden,
Bowral and Mittagong, around the dairy
areas of Nowra to the southern Housing
Commission outskirts of Wollongong.
This seat has put on more than 5500
since the last election and before the
writs close, probably early next month,
the increase could go as high as 10,000.
Most of this has come from the Housing
Commission homes of Oak Flats, and
the cheaper type of housing around
Minto and Campbelltown. The ALP
here has a good candidate, Mr Don
Nilon, against the sitting Liberal member,
Mr Jeff Bate. But a complication will be
a DLP candidate, unlike the last election..
However, Mr Nilon is a Catholic (also
a member of the executive of the Aus-
tralian Institute of Political Science and
a protege of Mr Calwell).


Parramatta is talked of seriously by
some ALP organisers as a possibility,
but the growth there has not been so
spectacular only 3000 electors have
gone on to the rolls. Whether the next
few weeks will mean many more is open
to question. With his stature as a senior
Minister, Sir Garfield, unless there is a
further swing, should hold the seat.
Labor organisers in NSW are talking
about those two seats as possible com-
pensation for almost inevitable losses in
Queensland.
Probably the Liberal Party’s best
metropolitan hope is Evans, a midde-
class Western Suburbs seat. But last week
the Party there chose as its standard-
bearer Dr Malcolm Mackay, a Pres-
byterian minister, who for the last few
years has been Master of Basser College
in the University of NSW. But there
were people asking last week whether a
minister was the best candidate for a
swing seat, in the light of the perennial
Australian suspicion of religion and
politics.
The seaside Eastern Suburbs seat of
Phillip, formerly held by RSL stalwart
Bill Aston, might once have been a swing
seat, but last week no one was talking
very seriously about it because the ALP
member, Mr Syd Einfeld, has dug him-
self in very well. It is merely noting a
political fact of life to say that his leader-
ship in Jewish community life in the
Eastern Suburbs had done much to
lessen the chances of a comeback by
Mr Aston.
To summarise, the indicator seats to
watch in NSW next month will be: for
a Government swing, Hume, Cowper,
Evans; for ALR gains, Macarthur and
Robertson.
Because the possible ALP gains are
as much dependent on population shifts
as on any swing, the chances are that,
even allowing for possible losses, the
status quo in total numbers is likely to
be maintained in NSW.
QUEENSLAND
Federal election campaign in
A Queensland will be tough, hard and
short. In the 1961 poll Queenslanders,
usually faithful supporters of the Liberal-
Country Party in the Federal sphere,
turned their backs on the Government
and nearly toppled it. The Government
lost eight metropolitan and country seats
—Petrie, Lilley, Wide Bay, Herbert,
Oxley, Capricornia, Griffith, Bowman.
Impartial observers believe the Govern-
ment could win back at least Petrie and
Lilley. Their significance was shown by
Calwell staying an extra day to speak
in those electorates. Former Supply
Minister and now State Liberal Party
president Hulme, who lost Petrie last
time by 795 votes to R. C. O’Brien, is
going to try again. D. J. Cameron won
Lilley for the Labor Party by 1114 votes.
There is a strong possibility that the
Country Party might win back Wide
Bay. There could be close contests in
some of the other seats, including Griffith
and Oxley. In Queensland Prime Mini-
ster Menzies and other big guns of the
parties will be touring the State. A
concentration is expected in the Metro-
politan seat of Moreton, won by J. Killen
by only 130 votes.
In Queensland the Labor Party holds
11 House of Representative seats,
Liberals three, Country Party four. There
will be an election also for the single
Senate vacancy in Queensland, for the
position now held by George Whiteside
for the ALP. He was appointed by the
Queensland Parliament following the
death of Senator Max Poulter. The
Labor Party is expected to re-endorse
him as its candidate. There is a chance
of a Government win here.
A pointer to the likelihood of the
Government improving its position in
Queensland was the very good win by
the Nicklin - Munro Country - Liberal
coalition in the State Government earlier
this year. This showed the very much
diminished effects of the credit squeeze
which nearly threw out the Government.
However, there is some feeling of
resentment at the early election.
BLACK BOY
ffij&uttetin
80 Years Ago: October 27, 1883
At 8 a.m. one day last week two
blacks and one white could be
observed dangling from a beam erec-
ted in a remote corner of the Brisbane
gaol. Murder was the European’s
crime, rape the aboriginals’. One of
the “niggers” was but 16 when he
committed the offence for which he
suffered death. He was known as
“Jango”, and was a lithe, intelligent
boy, but with no more conception of
European ethics than of the atomic
theory. Jango’s life was possibly like
that of many black boys we have
known. One day, perhaps, a detach-
ment of “native police” arrived at the
camp of his tribe, made in his father’s
chest half-a-dozen holes into which
you could put your fist, with Snider
bullets. Then they outraged and cut
the throat of his mother, knocked out
the brains of his brothers and sister,
who were either too old or too young
for their purposes, and turned their
horses' heads towards civilization. One
of these hired murderers carried be-
fore him on the saddle a little weep-
ing black boy. That was Jango: The
inspector commanding the detach-
ment had perhaps promised a friend
that he would “get him a boy” when
next he “dispersed” any niggers; and
so he kept Jango instead of grabbing
him by the legs, and swinging him
against a cedar tree and smashing his
skull to jelly. Then Jango was kept
at the shanty and made drunk “for
a lark”. Brutal N.Q. ruffians, sweep-
ing of the colonies, the scum of the
earth, poured rum down his throat,
and the dance-room echoed with
their drunken laughter as he, parrot-
like, lisped the blasphemies which
they had poured into his ears. Then
they sat him down cross-legged be-
side the table while they took their
meals, and made him dispute with
the dogs, as he had done in the camp
of his murdered parents, for lumps of
meat. It is pretty well the story of
more than one black man who has
been hanged by a Christian Govern-
ment.
EDUCATION
No Room at
the Library
Problem for a University
FROM GUY McNICOLL IN MELBOURNE
A lthough it was established only six
years ago, the Baillieu Library at
Melbourne University is already proving
inadequate to meet the demands of stu-
dents. It was designed to seat 2000
25 per cent of the student body in 1957.
But today there are 50 per cent more
students, and book loans have risen by
400 per cent.
Finance is the crux of almost every
Australian university problem. Faculty
self-interest is as great at Melbourne as
at any other. The communal service pro-
vided by the library is forgotten when-
ever handouts are forthcoming from the
university exchequer.
Chairman of the Board of Inquiry into
Library Services in Victoria, Sir John
Jungwirth, will shortly receive a petition
from the students asking that the library’s

seating accommodation be increased from
2500 to 4000, that the number of volumes
in the book stock be raised from 350,000
to half a million, and that the staff estab-
lishment be enlarged from 93 to 125.
The petition has attracted 4000 student
signatures already.
When the Premier, Mr Henry Bolte,
brought down the State Budget early in
September scant regard was paid to the
recommendations of the Ramsay Report
into tertiary education. The allocation to
be shared by Melbourne and Monash
Universities amounted to £5,757,000,
an increase of £1,673,000 on the year
1962-63. One of the proposals of the
Ramsay Committee was that the Uni-
versity of Melbourne should have its
student numbers gradually raised from
13,000 to 18,000. As it was further
recommended that these additional ad-
missions be made from 1965, the State
Government is unreasonably delaying
the extension of university facilities,
which are already overcrowded and over-
taxed.
Premier Bolte will hear the cries of
“More money for education” continue
unabated, despite the all-time record
allocation it was given in his Budget.
On the average, Victoria spends £24
on each student, primary, secondary,
technical, university, etc. The problem
of education has become too large for
the State to solve. It has so developed
that only an Australia-wide Federal
effort will fully satisfy the nation’s edu-
cation requirements.
“No other State is devoting to educa-
tion such a high proportion of the finance
available to it as in Victoria”, said Mr
Bolte in his Budget speech. The amount
of construction work at Melbourne Uni-
versity is colossal but, with the ever-
increasing demand for tertiary education,
it is insufficient. If the two universities
make a 50-50 split of their allocation,
each will get £2,878,500. With the
Howard Florey Laboratory and the Com-
merce and Economics building just com-
pleted, and with the microbiology and
architecture buildings taking shape, will
any money remain for extensions to the
Baillieu Library?
POLICE
The Electronic Speed Cop
Radar plus the “trained observer ”
FROM C. M. MILNE IN ADELAIDE
Earlier this year the SA Police De-
partment introduced radar equip-
ment to detect speeding motorists. Its
“Portable Electronic Traffic Analyser”
was reputed to be foolproof; it was said
that not even metal strips in hub caps
could affect its reading. On one day in
July, 19 motorists had the collective
ill-luck to be charged with speeding of-
fences detected by radar. All pleaded
guilty.
The police were naturally pleased that
their new equipment had not been chal-
lenged, but they did not have long to
wait. When a former racing driver, El-
dred Norman, was stopped at Virginia,
near Adelaide, and told that radar equip-
ment had shown his speed as 47 mph,
he denied the charge.
The defence cast grave doubts on the
accuracy of the equipment. It suggested,
for instance, that if a bird passed through
the beam at the same time as a car the
equipment would register their combined
speeds. Technical experts, called by the
prosecution, said that if two objects
passed through the beam at the same
time the faster of the two would be
recorded.
The magistrate, Mr Redman, ruled out
a fast bird on the grounds that the
chance of the police observers not noting
its presence was rather remote.
The experts agreed that there were
three main faults that could occur in
the equipment. They were a slow de-
generation caused by ageing valves or
other components; complete failure of
the equipment; an intermittent fault
which could occur during an assignment,
but which might not be apparent, or
even present, before and after an as-
signment.
Mr Redman ruled out the first two as
being easily detectable. On the difficult
third fault, it was the old “trained ob-
server” that carried the day. The police
sergeant using the equipment had esti-
mated Norman’s speed at between 45
and 50 mph, which confirmed the radar
reading.
Mr Redman, convicting Norman, said
the equipment, operated properly, pro-
vided a much more accurate measure of
the speed of a vehicle that would be
obtained by a tested speedometer.
The radar equipment emerged from
the challenge virtually unscathed but
it will remain unchallenged, apparently,
only as long as its reading can be backed
by a trained observer.
CIVIL SERVICE
Bones and
Bureaucrats
The intruding bulldozer
FROM A HOBART CORRESPONDENT
HThe ghost of John Beaumont, a dis-
tinguished Tasmanian pioneer public
servant, must have been fluttering
sympathetically around Hobart’s Govern-
ment offices recently while 20th century
bureaucrats duckshoved responsibility for
the re-interment of his bones.
Beaumont came to Van Diemen’s
Land in 1813 as private secretary to
Lieut-Governor Davey. He was succes-
sively made naval-officer-in-charge and
provost marshal only to have his appoint-
ments cancelled by the Colonial Office,
possibly because of his interest in the
cause of self-government. But later he
became Sheriff, Registrar - General of
Deeds, and Treasurer, and when he died
in 1872, aged 83, he was laid to rest
in a huge lead-lined coffin.
His resting place was St John’s Park
cemetery, one of the unnumerable little
graveyards which dotted Tasmania, and
one of the many which have recently
been rescued from weeds and black-
berries and converted to sports grounds
and reserves. The blade of a bulldozer
clanking through St John’s Park in this
cause unearthed Beaumont’s coffin.
Unhesitatingly, the Public Works De-
partment disclaimed responsibility for its
find. The Health Department, it said,
was in charge of grave removal opera-
tions. Six strong men loaded the coffin
on a truck and delivered it, with head-
stone, to the department’s garage.
A health official in an inspired moment
telephoned the Treasury to suggest that
Mr Beaumont’s former department
should take the coffin and its contents.
Under - Treasurer K. J. Binns firmly
indicated that finders were keepers.
Then Health Minister Bill McNeil
intervened. Inquiries had revealed that
Beaumont had discovered the Great Lake
in 1817, he said, and he believed that
Bothwell Municipality (which includes
the lake) would be honored to arrange
Beaumont’s reburial. If the councillors
rejected the offer the coffin would, with-
out further debate, be buried in a public
cemetery, Mr McNeil said.
But no debate was needed. In came
the Minister for Tourists, Mr Alex
Atkins, with a no-strings offer to have
the coffin interred in a specially conse-
crated plot at Miena, beside the Great
Lake, with the tombstone re-erected.


Around Melbourne
RED ROBES AND HOT WHISKERS
A s you must know, the year is not
divided into months, but into
serious merchandising compartments.
We have the New Year sales, the
summer sales, Mother’s Day, winter
sales, Father’s Day, the spring racing
carnival, and, then, at last, the decks
are cleared for the greatest, compart-
ment of all, Christmas. In recent
years Christmas has been arriving
earlier and earlier, getting indecently
mixed up with the hair of Mr Guy
Fawkes and the VRC.
Now, however, by mutual agree-
ment, there is a starting date. Every-
body goes on the starting blocks on
November 9. On that day, with great
ceremony, Father Christmases arrive
at the stores by helicopter, by boats
up the Yarra, even by tram along
Swanston Street, always with great
ceremony.
Last week your correspondent
noted a large advertisement in the
newspapers which startled him some-
what. It read: “WANTED! SANTA
CLAUS. If you’ve ever felt at Christ-
mas that you'd like to be Santa Claus
- then here’s your chance! You’ll
have to be fit. Your flowing red robes
and tickly white whiskers are very
hot in summer.
“You’ll have to be genuinely patient
and kind to masses of little children,
who’ll climb on your knee and bury
their hands in your whiskers. You
probably have a flair for acting al-
though you have never been on the
stage. The salary is excellent. You
will do a short course of training,
based on the famous American Santa
Claus School, at the end of October.
Interested? Then contact the Myer
Emporium.”
Was I interested? I could hardly
wait to get to Myers. A Father
Christmas school was sensational.
The Myers publicity staff explained
why it was necessary. Please excuse
me if I talk a little softly; we don't
want this spread around too much.
At Myers nigh on 4000 kids a day go
through the Santa Claus department,
therefore you need a whole football
team of Santa Clauses. Always there
are four on duty at once, and when-
ever one Santa starts to faint with
exhaustion another drops into his
place. It pays around £25 a week,
and it is said to be one of the hardest
jobs ever created for humans.
But, you see, no child ever sees
more than one Santa. They all go in
through one entrance, true, but then
by a system of mirrors, moving doors
and witchcraft they are channeled
off to the various members of the
team and they never realise that
there is indeed more than one Santa
Claus.
Well, this year the Myers folk got
to thinking. Being a Santa Claus was
a top PR job for the store. A Santa
Claus would only have to make one
false move, show even the slightest
irritation, and your age-old reputa-
tion of value and friendly service was
utterly ruined. And there’s nothing
more dangerous than the irate mother
of an irate child. So they wrote off
to the “Christmas Park . . . the world-
famous Santa Claus Inc., Albion,
New York.” And the Americans,
being the generous people they are,
came back with a whole raft of in-
formation. We learnt from the di-
rector, Mr Charles Howard, that the
school had been going since 1937.
“/Christmas Park,” said he, “is a
large colonial home, filled with
antiques, set in a yard of evergreen
and maple trees; the house a nostalgic
example of oldtime spirit and hospi-
tality ... a perfect setting for instruc-
tion and Santa lore. A beautiful new
class room has just been built. It is
finished in knotty pine, with wrought
iron candle fixtures, a big stone fire-
place and a lovely balcony with cut-
out pine tree railing. One look at this
room is an inspiration to be the best
Santa Claus ever.”
At the end of the course there is
a dinner and graduation ceremony.
The successful candidates receive their
BSC degrees. Bachelor of Science?
Apparently not. According to the
brochure it is the degree of Bachelor
of Santa Claus.
There are 28 subjects on the course,
and they cover such points as the
origin, history and evolution of Santa
Claus, Santa Claus make-up, child
psychology, Santa Claus promotions
and public relations, dance steps
Santa should know (for heaven's sake),
and rather more practical stuff like
Santa as a traffic stimulant and getting
the most of your Santa dollar.
Naturally all students get practical
work with real children. Tapes are
played back and commented upon.
And Mr Charles Howard gives in-
struction on Santa mechanics. For
example, it is essential that the store
Santa be equipped with hidden loud
speakers and microphones. This en-
ables his Santa assistant to interview
each child outside the booth. Then
when the child comes in, magically
Santa knows his name, what he wants
out of Dad, the lot. What’s more,
every Santa is checked out on real
reindeer. Mr Edwin Butters “the
only successful breeder of these ani-
mals in the United States” brings
over several reindeer every season for
the student to study.
The brochure also carries a run-
down on prices for equipping your
Santa. It’s mighty expensive. Just the
bare suit is worth 175 dollars, the
Santa wig and beard made of yak
hair 195 dollars, Santa boots 40 dol-
lars, and Santa belt 20 dollars.
Also on the price list is equipment
for Mrs Santa Claus. Aha, you didn’t
even know Father Christmas was
married, did you? Well, he is, and
Mrs Santa usually acts as the Santa
assistant. She is much cheaper to
equip because most Mrs Santas don’t
wear beards.
Myers are opening their school for
Santas on October 30, and everybody
should be thoroughly trained by blast-
off day, November 9. Regrettably,
they won't have the assistance of
Mr Edwin Butters and his reindeer,
but they will get a text book and a
course of lectures on the historical
side of Christmas, the store's back-
ground, public relations, child psy-
chology and make-up.
They have had a fine list of appli-
cants, including an ex-bank manager
and an ex-policeman. All students
will have to be checked medically
when temperatures get up around the
hundred. The weak are apt to perish
behind a face full of yak hair.
So that’s the story, dear Virginia.
There is, indeed, a Santa Claus; in
fact, quite a number of them, and
thanks to the Myer Emporium they
are all college trained.

A
There’s a fallacy current among users of furnace oil,
industrial fuel oils and distillates that they are all alike.
In the factor of pour point alone, there are vast differences
between fuel oils. A fuel with low pour point will give
better atomisation at the burner and thus big savings
on pre-heating costs. A factor such as this can often be
overlooked when buying fuel oil on a “price” basis.
Amoco, too, are selling fuel oils at very competitive prices,
but being acutely aware of the problems, we have made
an extensive study of fuel oil needs and its supply to
Australian users. Our Technical Staff and Laboratory are
ready to ensure you get the right fuel to do the job.

The Defence Row
Dividing up the cake
BY A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
It is a measure of the incompetence of
the Labor Opposition that Sir Robert
Menzies can justify an early election
by pointing to defence as the major
issue between the parties.
No one, even in the Government, can
be enthusiastic about the Government’s
record in defence. During the past decade
while Communism was moving gradu-
ally southwards in South-East Asia,
while Indonesia has been building up
arms and truculent policies together, the
defence vote was held constant in money
terms and thus in real terms was actu-
ally getting less. The increase in Govern-
ment spending recently announced has
lagged after rather than led the change
in public opinion, as alarm over the
situation to our north has spread. The
situation has deteriorated and anxiety
has deepened faster than the country’s
defences can be strengthened, for ships
and aircraft are not delivered until years
after they are ordered, and manpower
takes time to recruit That is the weak-
ness of the Government’s position.
All this would provide very fertile
ground for an Opposition that had
made the most of its opportunities.
Labor’s own record in the matter of de-
fence, however, is lamentable, while its
present attitudes are confusing and
equivocal. It has never stood in the past
for strengthening Australia’s defences —
except of course by unsubstantiated
statements about miraculously getting
more Value for less money, its spokes-
men, as reference to Hansard will prove,
have never made any constructive
suggestions; and it is most unlikely to
persuade anyone that it will put up a
better show than the Government now.
Labor’s policy on defence can be sum-
marised as follows:
• Alienate the Americans, and make
their naval communications station in
Western Australia useless, by insisting on
joint control of it.
• Take no military action, even in our
own urgent interest, except in conjunc-
tion with that conglomeration of black
and brown nationalism, the United
Nations.
• Deprive the United States of the
nuclear deterrent in the southern hemi-
sphere and thus of the means to protect
Australia, by declaring a nuclear - free
zone here while the Chinese work
quietly towards becoming a nuclear
power.
• Withdraw Australian forces from Mal-
aya as a result of having insisted on a
direct treaty which Malaysia, as a
neutral, would not wish to sign. Thereby
abandon our only foothold in Asia and
the costly bases that Australia has built.
• Convert SEATO into a cultural
alliance.
• Manufacture all our weapons of war
at home in order to create jobs for the
boys, whether or not this would lead
to maximum efficiency in defence.
• Expect, in spite of everything, to be
defended by our allies.
It is hard to think of any programme
that could be more completely on the
wrong tack. Labor has not even begun
to ask the relevant questions about de-
fence. It should start by making up its
mind on the strategic basis about
which most Australians are in a fine
muddle and go on to ask what more
should be done, given that or some other
strategic basis. Let us now examine these
questions.
At present our defence is based on the
proposition, first, that a friendly
South-East Asia is of primary strategic
interest to Australia. Hence our member-
ship (together with France, New Zea-
land, Pakistan, the Philippines, the
United Kingdom and the United States)
of the South-East Asia Treaty Organisa-
tion and our co-operation with the
British to guarantee Malaysia against
attack. If, however, the front line in
South-East Asia should fall, or if the
Indonesians should adventure, Australia
relies for protection on the ANZUS
pact with the United States and New
Zealand, as well as on its traditional
ties with Britain.
That sounds simple, yet a surprising
number of Australians do not accept it.
They believe that the effect of gearing
our defence to a war in South-East Asia
is to leave us unprotected at home. They
resent the accent on regular forces and
the concentration of effort on improving
their mobility and fire power. They have
faith in numbers as .such, and seem to
feel that a citizen soldier with an old-
fashioned rifle and a smattering of train-
ing is worth as much if not more than
a highly skilled regular with the latest

equipment. Finally they deplore our de-
pendence on allies.
In consequence, they advocate the res-
toration of national service and many
complain of the way the Citizens’ Mili-
tary Forces have been reduced, re-
grouped and reorganised. The object of
this reorganisation was to form units
entirely composed of men who were pre-
pared to go overseas if called upon to
do so, so as to avoid wasting time sorting
them out when the emergency is actu-
ally upon us. A sensible aim, one would
think. But the advocates of national
service also thought it desirable more
perhaps for the boys’ character than for
the country’s defence that national
servicemen should thereafter serve five
years with the CMF, and they resent
this shedding of men who were prepared
to fight at home though not abroad.
They claim that soon very few civilians
will have any idea how to defend their
homeland.
This type of criticism comes mainly
from returned servicemen and is not
unconnected with nostalgia for their own
military past. Nevertheless it is not to be
dismissed as such without examination.
Is it true that the accent on mobile
regular forces prepared to fight in Asia
leaves us unprotected at home? And are
we preparing for an eventuality that will
not in fact arise?
The answer to the first of these ques-
tions is that if a direct attack were made
upon Australia the mobility and fire
power of the regular forces would be no
less important within the bounds of this
vast continent than it would be if the
attack were somewhere in Asia. More-
over even if national service were re-
stored, the CMF doubled in size and the
defence vote trebled, we few would
still need the help of our allies the
United States and Britain in repelling
such an attack if it were made in any
force.
lITe shall not get that help unless we
" ourselves put something in the kitty.
That was the beauty of letting the
Americans have a communications sta-
tion on North West Cape. It is some-
thing we can do in the common cause,
which yet does not cost us anything.
Even as it is, however, neither ally feels
that we do enough. They certainly
would not be satisfied if we used up our
defence effort solely on preparing to
defend Fortress Australia. This is par-
ticularly so since we, who live in this
area, have a more direct interest in
keeping South-East Asia out of Com-
munist hands than either Britain or the
United States.
Before finally dismissing the argu-
ments against a front line in Asia we
must also ask the second question:
whether we are preparing for an eventu-
ality that is unlikely to happen? At least
one highly placed and influential service-
man thinks that we shall never in fact
commit land forces to fight in the South-
East Asian Peninsula, because to do so
would be to take on the Chinese, whose
“volunteers” would flock inexhaustibly
over the nearest border. Be that as it
may be, our troops might well be re-
quired to fight in Sarawak or in New
Guinea, in either of which places the
important thing would be to be there
with the fire extinguisher quickly. Speed,
mobility and professionalism are still
what is required.
Tt is often pointed out that Australians,
alhough individually richer than
the British, not much poorer than the
Americans, and less heavily taxed than
either, are getting part of their own
defence at the expense of their friends.
Whereas the Americans spend 11 per
cent of their gross national product on
defence and the British 7 per cent, Aus-
tralia spends only 2.8 per cent. This
could be considered a clever achieve-
ment, if ; (a) our friends were happy about
it, and (b) our defence could be con-
sidered adequate. But neither of these
conditions is fulfilled today.
The Government has announced a
substantial increase in defence spending
over the next five years, but as the
gross national product is rising, too, de-
fence spending will not increase much
proportionately. Even with the increases
that have been announced large gaps
remain.
1. THE ARMY
The Army, so frequently the target
of ignorant criticism, has done very
well over the last few years, as a result
of a consistent and comprehensible
policy, well presented and well adapted
to Australia’s treaty obligations. It has
won recognition of its primary role in
wartime, with the other two services sup-
porting it, conveying it and protecting
it. The RAAF, it is true, has also been
conceded a strike role with the new
bomber whose name is anxiously
awaited, and the Navy has a residual
ability to take the initiative with the
fixed wing aircraft, which have been
granted another few years of life. But
most of the fighting would be done by
the Army.
It has prepared itself especially to
fight in South-East Asia. It has re-
organised its field force into what is
known as a “pentropic” division the
name derived from its five infantry bat-
talions, each of 1300 men, designed to
fight in the tropics, and the organisation
copied from the American “pentomic”
divisions (since abandoned). Two of the
five battle groups are regular, and three
are CMF, but a third regular group is
being formed. Altogether the field force
fully mobilised would number 14,000,
of which two-fifths are at present regu-
lars.
This will seem a small number of
fighting men out of an army which is
now about 23,000 and which is to be
expanded to 28,000 by 1968. At present
it takes about seven or eight supporting
personnel to put one regular in the
field. In a small army like the Australian
the tail is bound to seem disproportion-
ately large. The same infrastructure
could support a much larger field force,
and is kept in being to make expansion
possible. Nevertheless one cannot help
wondering whether experts in organisa-
tion and management who were not
encumbered by army traditions could
not redeploy the manpower more econ-
omically.
Army’s other main problem is to
get to the theatre of operations. It
cannot commandeer merchant shipping
unless there is a formal declaration of
war. But it has an arrangement with the
Australian owned air lines which re-
quires no proclamation. Meanwhile,
HMAS Sydney, a former aircraft-carrier
and now described as a fast troop-car-
rier, has actually become a vehicle car-
rier, with drivers and port-handling par-
ties. The Army has bought LCTs and
ducks to tranship these vehicles to the
beach. But one problem that remains
is that it cannot land except on a friendly
beachhead because it has neither the
numbers nor the specialised equipment
for an assault landing.

2. THE RAAF
The RAAF will do very well, once
it has its bomber to replace the Can-
berra. The Minister for Defence, Mr
Athol Townley, is at present in the
United States, and it seems probable
that he will return with a package deal
by which Australia is lent, or sold on
very favorable terms, phantom aircraft
to fill the gap, on condition that it
orders the TFX later. The TFX is the
American counterpart of the British
TSR 2, but it is on the drawing board,
whereas the TSR 2 does exist and will
shortly have its trials. However, no
tempting package deal has vet been of-
fered by the British.
3. THE RAN
The Navy shows the most obvious
weaknesses of any of the services. It
is efficient and for the most part modern,
but it is simply too small to carry out
its task effectively. The Minister for the
Navy, Senator Gorton, staked every-
thing on getting from the United States
a carrier capable of carrying fixed-wing
aircraft and therefore of bombing. But
the Cabinet saw the role of the Navy as
being to convoy the Army to the war and
essential imports into Australia, and were
unconvinced by Senator Gorton’s argu-
ments. They offered him escorts to be
built in Australia, which apparently he
refused. How this happened is a mystery,
for clearly the navy needs escorts, of
which it has only six in commission.
In wartime, of course, five or six ships
can be brought out of mothballs. But as
against that it must be remembered that
the paper strength of ships in commis-
sion is less than it seems because of
necessary repairs and refitting not to
mention strikes and go-slows at the
dockyard. The Navy will gradually be
augmented by three American guided
missile destroyers and four British con-
ventional submarines. The guided missile
destroyers are to provide the air cover
that will be lacking when “Melbourne’s”
fixed-wing aircraft go out of service.
They are being bought interest free, but
their price of £25 million apiece is
only part of the final cost, and many
people in the Navy are doubtful about
this switch to American buying. The
dockyard has to be retooled to take
them (even the screws have a thread
different from that of British type ships),
and personnel will have to go to the
United States for training. A problem
to which no solution is at present in
sight is how the Navy will find the
technical personnel, uniformed and civi-
lian, to deal with them. Nothing can
be done to increase the strength of the
Navy before the election, but it would
be good for the Government as well as
good for Australia to place some orders
now.
Athol Townley
“I've been a battler ”
An interview with PETER HASTINGS
JJOW did you get into politics?
I sometimes wonder. It was after
the war. I was an ex-serviceman fed
up with rationing, shortages and Labor
Party arrogance. A group of Hobart
lawyers, doctors and businessmen ap-
proached me and asked me if I would
stand as a Liberal candidate. They
promised me every support, canvassing,
door-knocking and so on. I think they
felt they’d rather have a half-wit in
parliament than a clever bloke out of it.
Anyway, they’ talked me into it.
What was your political background?
There wasn’t any. I had no political
interests beyond the average man's and
I certainly had no political ambitions.
I remember I had to pay 2s. 6d. to join
the Liberal Party before I could stand
for pre-selection. That'll show you how
little I was involved in politics.
Do you like politics?
Don’t make me laugh. No sane man
can really like them. I enjoy being at
the centre of things, running a big depart-
ment, doing things on a national scale,
serving my country. I’ve held the Social
Services, Air and Immigration portfolios
as well as this one. I used to get a bit
disappointed by starting legislation and
reforms of various sorts and watching
them beaV fruit after I’d left the portfolio
for another one. But that's the luck of
the game. But politics themselves can
be tough. You know party meetings,
Cabinet meetings, campaigning, depart-
mental detail and constant travelling;
down to Melbourne Friday night to
work, down to Hobart Saturday morning
to attend to my business and see my
family, back to Melbourne on Sunday
night and more work and then up to
Canberra on Monday morning. Do I
like politics!.
And yoii had no political interests
until 1949 when you were 42?
Look, I've been a battler all my life.
I never had the time. I came from a
poor family. My closest friend, apart
from my brother, was a 16-stone wharf
laborer. When my brother and I were
kids we had to try and help my mother
keep the family going. I more or less put
myself through pharmacy. I made a
quid or two here and there with a bit of
sport writing, but it was tough going. In
our family we owe everything to our
mother.
And then?
My brother —he became leader of
the Opposition in Tasmania you know
and I came to Sydney in 1928. I re-
member we cashed a small insurance
premium which my mother had taken out
and took second-class fares on the old
Zeelandia. We were dead broke when


we arrived in Sydney. We battled. I
could tell you some very funny stories
about those days but I won’t. I wouldn’t
let you print them if I did. Things got
better in the ’thirties. I ran a chain of
five chemists’ shops and just before the
war I became chief analytical chemist for
Gartrell White, the bakers. But the
family was still battling in Hobart and I
wanted to be near my mother, so I went
back just before the war started. When
war broke out I was on the Naval Re-
serve. I joined up and finished the war
with two and a half rings.
Why won’t you let me print the stories
you mention?
Oh, various reasons. I don’t think the
Boss would like it anyway.
Is he hard to work for?
Menzies is the best boss I ever worked
for and in one sense the easiest. He’s
also the brainiest man I know. He has
more brains than the rest of us put to-
gether. He has only one fault. He’s too
tolerant. You can print that if you like.
If he asks you a question about your
work and you say, “I don’t know”, he’ll
accept that. He doesn’t expect you to
have an answer to everything at a
moment’s notice. But if you try to bluff
him he starts to cross-examine you and
then you're in trouble. He’s a merciless
cross-examiner.
What would you rather have done in
life?
I always wanted to be either a surgeon
or a commercial pilot. I didn't have the
brains or opportunity to be a surgeon.
I’m not brainy. I'm a commonsense
man and an administrator. Even now I’d
be a pilot if I could. I hold a Grade II
commercial pilot’s licence. I really love
flying. I remember one Saturday after-
noon when we were kids my brother and
I cycled over to Hobart aerodrome. A
plane sat on the field. It would look
pretty ancient today. I stood there pat-
ting it and after a while I summoned up
enough courage to jump into the cock-
pit. I was in heaven, when a pair of
grimy hands picked me up and dumped
me out. It was the mechanic. I remem-
ber the kick I got to this day.
When did you take up flying?
In the ’thirties at £5 10s. an hour. It
was expensive but I loved it and I still
fly as much as I can. I flew a super-
sonic jet fighter abroad a couple of years
back. I wasn’t supposed to but I did.
And I helped to land a commercial Vis-
count in bad weather not so long ago.
But I’m not going to tell you the details
of those stories either, so don’t ask me.
Flying’s in my blood. When I get to-
gether with some of my flying cobbers
we fly 10,000 hours in a night’s conver-
sation.
Who or what was the biggest influence
in your life?
Undoubtedly my mother. She was a
magnificent woman of great character
and spirituality. We worshipped her. I
remember once I made two shillings and
I took it home to her and told her one
day we’d send her round the world. We
did, too. Twice. She died the day I was
elected to Parliament. She was 83.
A last question in your critically
important job how do you find things up
north?
A curly question, too. However, there’s
no reason why I shouldn’t say this much.
We’ve got to defend ourselves. That’s
one reason why I’m going abroad. But
at the same time, to take Indonesia, we’ve
got to be friends with these people and
we’ve got to learn to understand them.
They’re a likeable, pleasant people
emerging from 400 years of very tough,
repressive colonialism. When you get
out into their villages as I have you find
they’re just like us and interested in the
same bread and butter things. For some
of them individually I have great
respect. Take Nasution. He leaves you
in no doubt as to what he means and
where he stands. He’s a tough fellow in
his early ’forties, a Sumatran school
teacher who became a damned good
soldier. He’s also a very good Moslem,
did you know? When he was down here
he kept on asking me, “Athol, where is
the east?” I told him and then I began
to notice he’d go off for a few minutes
several times a day. I used to say to his
wife, “Where’s Haris?” She used to tell
me he’d absented himself to pray. A very i:
moral man, too. He told me Moslems
can’t divorce wives at will as we are
inclined to think but only where there’s
an overwhelming reason such as child-
lessness or something like that. A very
nice bloke, Haris.
"Creative thinking is not loafing, woman."

OUT AND ABOUT
On Firm Foundations
Nothing to fear but evolution
By JAN SMITH
As mother says, the ’twenties was a
fabulous era. Where, in this city
today, can a poor, unemployed girl
make a fast 10s. giving her vital statistics
to a corset company? In 1926, giving
your measurements to the Berlei corset
company was a good way to make a
little pin-money. You didn’t have to be
unemployed, but for Fred Burley,
described in the Berlei archives as
“young, dark and enthusiastic”, the
Sydney job registry office seemed the
best place to start on his brave new
scheme for measuring a national sample
of 20,000 women.
The result, gleaned from surf sheds,
Turkish baths and women’s clubs, was
the Berlei Indicator, a multicolored
chart with peripheral measures and a
slide rule, which came to be adopted in
most English-speaking countries as a
kind of fitter’s bible. Two-way stretch
and the decline of the rigid corset meant
less work for the indicator, but the com-
pany moved smoothly with new trends
and today, at its Regent Street office and
the Punchbowl factory, Berlei is a
several million pound industry. Its wholly
owned subsidiary company in England
has an annual turnover of £3,000,000
and there is a thriving associate company
in New Zealand.
Foundation garment business is highly
competitive, publicity conscious and
scientifically equipped to provide the
maximum of control with the minimum of
discomfort. Bras and girdles, unlike cos-
metics, are not subject to sales tax, the
Government regarding them more as a
health item than a luxury. With Hickory,
who boosted themselves into second
place after the last war, Berlei claims
to share about 65 per cent of the nation’s
sales, followed by smaller firms like
Hestia, Formfit, Jenyns, Gossard, Sym-
ington and a smattering of even smaller
firms.
At the time of writing the Melbourne
based firms of Dowd Associates (Hick-
ory), Gossard and Symington (Peter
Pan, Liberty) had not taken up offers to
talk about themselves. Gossard and Sym-
ington, both small firms, have led quiet
lives, but Hickory is lately publicity shy.
Since Tania Verstak they have ceased
to sponsor the Miss Australia Quests.
Production statistics for 1961-62 give
total output figures of 60,954 dozen roll-
on girdles and pantees, 5,796 surgical
corsets, belts and pantee girdles, 2,064
dozen maternity girdles, and 137,128
dozen “other corsets and girdles”. Cor-
selettes and torsolettes (meaning all-in-one
garments and bras-that-grew to hip level
or lower) numbered 5,906 dozen. Added
up, this gives a lump total of 211,848
dozen various foundation garments, or
2,542,176. Bras reached a grand total
of 446,508 dozen, or 5,358,096, which
included 19,131 dozen maternity bras.
Berlei estimate that sales work out at 1.9
bras and .6 girdles per woman per year.
American women consume almost
twice as much; three bras and just over
one girdle a year. With the Maidenform
Company alone turning out 9000 dozen
bras a day, and a population of 63
million women, it is not hard to see
why. The same old reason for most of
our troubles gets trotted out. We’re a
small country.
In the last financial year, Berlei’s pro-
fits dropped a sharp 22 per cent to
£195,000, despite sales of nearly
£6,000,000. “Relatively heavy” losses
were anticipated through debts owed by
trading companies in the Reid-Murray
group (such as Melbourne’s Hicks
Atkinson) and corresponding provisions
were made in the 1962-63 statement.
Sales were up at home and abroad, but
British profits, normally ploughed back
into the Australian company, were lower
because of unemployment, bad weather,
and Common Market jitters. Directors
say prices will almost certainly rise in
the next 12 months.
From this point the reasoning continues
on the familiar economic roundabout.
Small population means small output
means higher costs, a problem triangle
with all three sides equally difficult to
scale. For Berlei, the higher cost side is
probably the hardest to conquer.
Some of the costs are new; others,
like heavy overseas franchise commit-
ments, are built in. Licences to manu-
facture Warners, Maidenform, Gothic,
Sarong and Hollywood Vassarette each
mean an annual payback of 5 per cent
of sales, and in addition to this the
designs often need adapting, by a staff
of five designers, to suit Australian con-
ditions and provide a wider range of
fittings.
Desolie Richardson, Berlei’s top
designer, started 24 years ago as a
junior in the design department. With no
official course for foundation garment
designing available, Miss Richardson
studied costing, textile construction,
spinning, and attended three years of
anatomy lectures and one year of obstet-
rics, no mean substitute for a degree.
She is convinced that women have the
edge on men in bra and girdle planning.
Men, she says, design foundations much
the same way as they’d build a bridge.
“They design the garment on strictly
utilitarian lines,” says Miss Richardson,
“and then tack on a bit of frill and lace
to make it pretty.”
Since the 1926 survey, Berlei has laid
heavy stress on accurate measurements
and trained fitting supporting a small
army of consultants who shuttle regu-
larly through department stores in capi-
tal cities and country centres. Berlei’s
free training schools put through more
than 300 salesgirls a year, costing the
company an annual £25,000 for travel-
ling expenses and accommodation allow-
ances. A correspondence course, with
the same diploma, caters for 200 country
salesgirls each year.
Other experts, guided by Berlei’s
Sales Planning Executive Patricia Wat-
son, give yearly lectures to secondary
schools, advising on corsetry and allied
matters of posture, personal hygiene and
diet. Brand names aren’t stressed, but
the company’s image is preserved and
the consumers’ age range slowly takes in
younger women.
Widening the market from the junior
end is only one way. At the other end of
the age scale, says Desolie Richardson,
the problem is even harder.

Brought up on stories of Catherine de
Medici’s 13-inch waist, and subjected to
centuries of tight lacing by wire, steel,
metal, wood and fur, it is not surprising
that the older women still harbor some
prejudices. There are some women,
usually New Australians, who see any
kind of foundation garment as a threat
to their femininity, but it is the masochist
fringe that set manufacturers the bigger
problem.
Berlei's expert on what the well-bred
woman needs and buys is Marketing
Manager John Mostyn, tall, dark and
every bit as enthusiastic as the company’s
late founder. Mr Mostyn, 34, was in
civil engineering before he joined Berlei
two years ago. “My first reaction to
Berlei was ‘Oh, God, those surgical corset
people,’ but once I'd got my facts straight
I was quite happy. Marketing is much
the same anywhere. And socially it’s
been tremendous. You’ve no idea how
many women talk to you at parties when
they know you're in foundation gar-
ments.”
Knowing what women need, his prob-
lem is to sell it. Advertising does its best
to help, in return for a quarter of a mil-
lion each year. “We try to keep it whole-
some romantic,” says John Mostyn,
“but hgver sexy”. Women’s organisations
keep a watch for anything salacious, or
as Mr Mostyn says, “dicey”.
In general Berlei try to support Aus-
tralian firms who make component parts,
although buying Australian woven piece-
goods last year increased costs by
£26,000, through a Tariff Board protec-
tion levy on man-made fibres in the
weaving industry. “Naturally we’d pre-
fer to get our materials close to home,”
said director John Hurley, “without over-
seas delays, but in some cases it’s simply
not economical either for us or for the
manufacturers. There isn’t enough need
in Australia for specialised woven piece-
goods to produce them on an economic
scale.”
T>erlei buys 60 per cent of its elastic
in Australia, but overseas countries
offer a more tempting variety of nylons,
laces and embroideries. New trading
regulations with Japan struck another
blow, the Most Favored Nation clause
forcing down duties well below the old
57i per cent on bras. While this is bad,
the unlimited influx of bras from Hong
Kong, which has no restrictions at all, is
worse, and Mr Hurley says the 110,000
dozen bras imported annually from the
East are retarding the growth of the Aus-
tralian industry.
Out at Burwood, Hestia’s Managing
Director Michael Hershon thinks the pas-
sion for measuring is something of a use-
less obsession. “Women’s vanity is some-
thing no tape measure can overcome.” he
says, citing his recent predicament of
finding a 348 bra model. Sifting through
the 30 applicants, Mr Hershon uncovered
a chapter of horrors. Not one was a
genuine 348. “It’s supposed to be model
size,” he said, “so naturally they all pack
themselves into a 348. Actually 32C is
a more likely norm —slim girls with good
bust development through swimming.”
With a sales increase of 22 per cent
in the last six months, the Hestia com-
pany is doing nicely in the medium price
field. The company was started in 1940
by Mr Hershon’s parents, who left their
bra manufacturing business in Austria at
the outbreak of war. Arriving in Aus-
tralia without a pfennig, they set up busi-
ness in the T & G Building with two
sewing machines and unlimited business
acumen. In 1960 Hestia obtained a back-
door listing on the Sydney Stock Ex-
change through Holyman Woods, a de-
funct construction and civil engineering
business. With a capital of £300,000,
Hestia’s profit in the 1961-62 period was
£51,164, garnered from 2500 retail out-
lets throughout Australia.
Hestia is the only major company in
the Australian field not directly or in-
directly committed by licence or manu-
facturing arrangement to overseas prin-
cipals, and being more of a homegrown
family concern “we’re definitely
chauvinistic” Michael Hershon feels
his company is in a better position to
expand overseas. Hestia already exports
to New Caledonia, Suva and Hong Kong,
and has plans for masterminding emer-
gent bra and girdle industries in India,
Pakistan and Japan, supplying informa-
tion and technical help for a 5 per cent
royalty.
From the economic point of view, Her-
shon says import duties on bra and girdle
components force Australian prices up
above the American level, making the
better class girdle, and particularly the
all-in-one, dependent on a tiny minority of
high-earning, clothes-conscious working-
women. “Australia simply hasn’t a high
enough bra-and-girdle wearing popula-
tion,” Mr Hershon said. “If the Govern-
ment had increased child endowment
after the war, we’d be making more and
cheaper garments now.”
The Burwood factory, established with
some trepidation in 1951, now covers
45,000 square feet of floor space, and on
their staff of 330, mostly young people,
everyone pitches in. With only three
schools in the world offering a full course
in bra and girdle designing (one in Eng-
land, two in the United States) Hestia’s
five women designers learn by practical
experiment with Mr Hershon, a gradu-
ate designer, filling in the gaps.
Hestia also sends lecturers into schools,
where they find a genuine intelligent in-
terest, and a considerable shyness. Al-
though Hestia produces Young Eve, a
teenage range starting at 12/6 for bras
and 19/6 for girdles, Mr Hershon thinks
the best way to enlarge the market is to
go abroad, to the East in particular, and
New Zealand, Fiji, Suva and New
Guinea.
“It costs me as much to send a sales
manager from Sydney to Perth as it does
to send him from Sydney to New Zea-
land,” he said. “Western Australia has
765,000 people against New Zealand’s
21 million.” Put this away, Hestia’s over-
tures to neighboring countries seem
logical.
Mr Hershon wouldn’t give an adver-
tising figure, but had some cruel things
to say about the more spectacular pro-
motions. “Women haven’t the slightest
desire to be rowed down the Nile or
chased by pink elephants,” he said.
Even the question of semantics has
come under Mr Hershon’s scrutiny. “I’d
like to get away from the word founda-
tions,” he said. “Foundations are for
houses and grandmothers.” So far he
hasn’t hit on a good alternative. Under-

fashions is too cumbersome, intimate
apparel too genteel.
Like a true philosopher, Michael Her-
shon finds a funny side to foundations,
gets a kick out of saying “Obviously” to
flowing ladies who tell him they’ve never
worn a girdle.
Formfit, in the medium price range,
also increased their sales 22 per cent, in
the seven months to January 31, 1963.
But the going wasn't all roses. “We're
at the tail end of the slump from the last
Budget,” explained youngish, crewcut
general manager Brian Ettelson, who
came to the company from years with
the Lucas and Prestige underwear firms.
Despite competition, Mr Ettelson feels
the foundation garment industry is a small
heaven compared with the tooth-and-claw
business of the rag trade proper.
Formfit evolved from a business
started in 1939 by Mr W. J. Nicholas,
which became Merica Pty Ltd in 1947.
The holding company, Merica Founda-
tions Limited, was formed in 1948 and
a licence was obtained from Formfit,-
USA, in 1954. By 1959 the American
company had a 51 per cent interest. After
further changes in name and manage-
ment the holding company is now Form-
fit of Australia Limited, with Formfit
USA having a 54 per cent interest. It has
a factory of 250 girls at Guildford and
sales offices in every State.
The Formfit people are not greatly
concerned with fittings, measurements
and statistics. “We're in this business
simply to make money,” says Mr Ettel-
son, “and we feel this is the best way
to do it. The whole trend now is toward
change. I wouldn’t exactly call it planned
obsolescence, but when a woman buys a
girdle or a coat or a pair of shoes
these days, she doesn’t plan for it to last
her the next 10 years. Maybe your
mother might, but even mothers and
grandmothers are getting younger all the
time.”
Designs and know how are readily
available from the parent company,
where Italian designer Emilio Pucci is
vice-president in charge of styling. In
the last six months the company has
marketed a cheaper range, Carnival,
which it also exports in limited quantities
to Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuala Lum-
pur and Japan.
But even for the medium price range
market, planned obsolescence can be
overstretched. Big fleas have little fleas,
and both the upper and medium bracket
manufacturers are increasingly worried
by the cheaper models made readily
available in chain stores and on the
ground floors of most big department
stores. At their recently-expanded factory
headquarters in South Brisbane, Jenyns
Queensland Sales Manager, Mr S. A.
Hampton, declined to discuss his com-
pany’s operations. The letterhead admit-
ted parentage of surgical corsetry (since
1899), Materna Lady and Goddess, but
made no mention of its change-of-life off-
spring which has been selling under
Woolworth’s St Mark label for the last
18 months.
Starting at 14s. 6d. the St Mark bra
appears to be the lowest price range in
the business. Jenyns are not the sole sup-
pliers, but exact figures are hard to come
by. “We’ll make bras for anyone who can
pay us,” said one medium-priced range
director, meaningfully, “and so will most
of the others.”
One of the latest entrants in the cheaper
price field is Lovable, whose head office
in Sydney’s National Building shares the
directory board with The London Mis-
sionary Society. Lovable was born in
1960 after tie manufacturer David Klip-
pel, on a trip to the United States,
decided there was room for a branch of
the American Lovable Company in Aus-
tralia. Mr Klippel now shares director-
ship in Australia with Mr Frank Camp-
bell, and the company is fitting out a
modern office with purple Thai silk chairs
and turquoise carpets, from which sales
and the company’s Rydalmere factory
will be controlled.
The company have plans for helping
the economy along by gradually using
more local components, thereby provid-
ing more employment for its potential
customers in factories, mills and offices.
Can the price be kept at 19s. lid.? Mr
Campbell is probably aware of the risk,
but for the true businessman there’s no
thrill like being out on a limb.
In the chancy world of women’s
apparel, the bra and girdle industry oc-
cupies a safe niche. No quiet backwater,
it goes from strength to strength in the
certainty that no matter what disasters
may come, women will still be wearing
bras. Their products are medically ap-
proved, Government encouraged, and in-
capable of being run up at home. If you
want a safe place for your capital or
your son's business talents, the foundation
garment industry is a healthy outlet.
Evolution is the only threat. “Darwin,
Lysenko, Dobzansky ...” declares
Shisgal’s angry young rebel in “The
Tiger”. “In another hundred years you
won’t have any.” But in the foundations
business no one is really worried.
Bingo for Britain
Make it new for you’re on the way up
By DONALD HORNE
Going out by train from London to
the village where I used to live
and by the five-seven, the train I
used to catch I noticed one new thing.
No bowler hats. In my day it was all
bowlers, except for me. They managed
to drape me in a dark grey suit and
swathe me in striped shirts but they
didn’t get me into a bowler.
Of course one had to be careful. Away
for seven years and then back for seven
days. Beware of superficial generalisa-
tions. In front of the fire after dinner
I did some corroborative research with
the friends who were putting me up for
the night on this weird journey back-
wards to a place where I once saw what
would then have been described as my
future. I was told the bowler hat lot
were older now, if not dead. The live
ones still wore their bowlers, but they
were too old for the five-seven. They
wore them now on the three-ten. And
the young chaps weren’t keeping it up.
Good. The costume dress revival was
one of the many irritating false trails
of people trying to rediscover self-im-
portance.
The symptoms of village affluence
were also good to see. Everybody had
the water laid on. The picturesque pig-
sties called cottages had been knocked
down and replaced with moderately ugly
houses. Everybody had bathrooms and
electric appliances in their kitchens and
this would have been unbelievable
in this village seven years ago a few
had cars. There was regular bingo in
the church hall, with enough profit to
pay for its heating, and the Rector was
getting full house with his sermons on
Christine.
The Labor candidate recently ad-
dressed the village. He told them that
they must be saved from their feudal
past and that their squire must no longer
order them around. The villagers were
so angry that they held up his car and
wouldn’t let him leave until he apologised.
So here I was in the heart of it.
Affluent, bingo-debauched Macmillan’s
Britain. Weimar Britain, its morals erod-
ed because it had the water laid on. By-
zantine Britain, polluted by electric appli-
ances. One doesn’t have to go there to
know that Macmillan was speaking the
exact truth when he told them they’d
never had it so good. (Although they
could still have it much better.) It’s all
in the figures. But it’s pleasant to see
it under one’s own nose.
People in London obviously have a

better time now. I wasn’t keen to go
back. But once there it seemed a fine
place to be. All right for me, perhaps,
dining on wild duck in the Savoy Grill
and then seeing the Brecht play at the
Mermaid. But what about them? I mean
them.
There seemed to be so many more
people enjoying the things the bowler-
hatted lot used to enjoy. There is a
greater lightness of life. People have
pleasant places where they can meet
and talk and eat and drink. The increase
in sexual freedom between ordinary
people is obvious. And there’s all that
culture being splashed around at prices
almost anyone can afford.
There are so many intellectual car-
eers to maintain or make in the State-
of-the-Nation debate in London that
after even only a week the thing begins
to seem a bit of an act. Everyone I
spoke to, except one bouncingly opti-
mistic Labor MP, was far too unnerved
by the so-called Profumo case and draw-
ing far too many conclusions from it.
One learned nothing about Britain
from the Keeler affair one didn’t know
before. I don’t want to go all over that
again, but merely to add that what went
wrong is that the Keeler affair produced
a condition to which there were no re-
flexes. There are traditions and institu-
tions to deal with almost everything in
England. Old editorials to look up, old
speeches to re-write. Suez fiascos . . .
ruinous financial policies . . . getting the
boot from de Gaulle . . . emergencies of
war and peace ... all old stuff. But
you had to go back to the reign of
William IV to know how to handle
Christine Keeler.
Tntellectuals. In Australia nobody is a
A famous intellectual. I don’t mean aca-
demic. An academic deputation, in its
lower reaches anyway, is something that
you can pick up by doing a bit of work.
I mean a famous intellectual. It’s also
hard going in London. Writers don’t
make the grade as easily in London as
they do in Paris or Rome or Berlin.
But what they can do in London un-
like Australia is to make a living out
of it, and there is a big enough intellec-
tual public to make at least a restricted
name for oneself. This may be one of
the reasons for the silliness of so much
serious comment in England. Make it
new. You’re on the way up. Or you’re
there and you want to stay there. Puff.
Puff.
This feeling of ambition among intel-
lectuals has always given me the creeps.
As soon as one detects it in London one
almost feels nostalgic for the painful
loneliness of the Australian intellectual
desert, with its few savage warrior tribes.
These London intellectuals just can’t
take it easy. Here are ordinary people
going to bingo or Brecht but their intel-
lectual leaders still want them to assume
grand roles. This frustrated self-import-
ance sticks out where you can see it.
They expose it in each other. But it re-
mains. For example, Africa. This strate-
gically unimportant continent, with a
population only a little bigger than Indo-
nesia’s, absorbs the greatest proportion
of the attention many intellectuals give
to the world beyond Europe. Asia, with
15 times Africa’s population, the place
where half the world’s people live and
containing more than half the world’s
problems (including Communist China)
is an area they would prefer to tidy up
and forget. (Can’t Diem do a deal with
Ho Chi Minh? Won’t Maphilindo fix
South-east Asia?)
This is one form of parochialism.
The Commonwealth is the silliest. Faces
fall on both Left and Right if one laughs
out loud at the diffident suggestion that
Britain might find its destiny in the
Commonwealth. What’s the Common-
wealth going to be when the Nehru-Men-
zies-Nkruma-Calwell political generation
goes? Give it ten years.

West” can be parochial. Several times
I was told that there was reason to be-
lieve that beneath the ideological ver-
biage Russia was aggressive towards
“The West,” but China wasn’t. When I
replied that there was also reason to be-
lieve that China was aggressive towards
“The East,” meaning us out here, there
was bland agreement. The magic phrase
“The West” is taken to mean all of us
non-Communist Asians when our support
is wanted, but fundamentally to many
Europeans it means just Western Europe.
The more internationally minded use
“Atlantic Community,” which brings in
America and Canada. Elardly anybody
seriously thinks about us Asians. Except
America. So far as Australia is con-
cerned, “The West” can look after it-
self.
The British softness-towards-Com-
munism question also gets mislaid by
the few commentators who are acute
enough to see the problem. It’s only
when one gets back there and sees all
the apparatus of high circumstances
the Queen, The Lord Privy Seal, the
Leader of Her Majesty’s Opposition,
Sir William Haley, “The New Statesman”,
the Savoy Grill, the Tower of London
that one feels comforted enough by
this superficial corroborative evidence to
make the simple statement that the
British are sulking. They’ve set all this
heavy stuff and they don’t know what to
do with it. Straight after the war, flushed
with a misleading sense of destiny, they
were harder on Communism than the
Americans. But they had bitten off more
than they could chew and they had to
call the Americans in. Since then they
sometimes try to conduct the band from
the insulting position of second fiddle.
This unease of a Britain faced with
American power and European progress
is made worse because of the relics of
the old imperial apparatus. Things might
get better when more of this rigmarole
rusts away. In seeking a “purpose,”
Britain will either end up in a mess or
take what's going. All that seems to be
going for the moment is to develop an
overt enthusiasm for economic develop-
ment and general affluence and to go
into Europe, if anyone will ever let them
in. Not getting into Europe made Britain
look dangerously silly.
Two odd things happened to me in
London. One was that I liked the place
very much better on return than I had
expected. One can leave it with a great
feeling of goodwill for its ordinary people
and wish them the best of luck in the
shareout. The second was that it sud-
denly seemed intolerable that Australians
should any longer get mixed up with
these purely private matters. Whether
we like it or not, it won’t be long before
we have to start looking for a President.

“The Equal
Of Any
Englishman”
Concluding the Lee Kuan
Yew story
From ALEX JOSEY
in Singapore
IN 1955 Lee said he thought that
through the education system it
would, over 15 to 20 years, be pos-
sible to produce a generation which is
completely Malayan.
Lee himself at that time was already
working hard, several hours a day, to
fit himself to become a Malaysian lead-
er capable of meeting and talking to most
people in their own tongues. At school,
he had picked up Malay, was in fact
a good speaker of Malay, but his Chinese
dialects had been neglected. With
characteristic energy and application, Lee
Kuan Yew became an ardent student
again. He perfected his Malay, he
struggled with Chinese dialects until,
today, Lee's ability to make public
speeches in English, Malay, and two
Chinese dialects is accepted as being
normal. A great deal of hard work
went into this acquisition, as several
teachers will testify, but to Lee the need
to be able to converse with other Malay-
sians direct was a vital ingredient in
explaining the meaning of racial har-
mony. It was something which just had
to be done.
Records prove that Lee Kuan Yew
himself has always been more of a Mal-
ayan than a Chinese. This came about
through the nature of things because of
his early formative years at school, where
he mingled with other boys of-other races,
all Malayans, listening to and speaking
in, as youngsters can, several languages.
In this way, mixing early with brother
Malayans, Lee escaped racialism. Very
young, Lee attended a small Chinese
school, but he was not there long, and
soon he was sent to his first English
school, the Telok Kurau East School, in
1931, when he was eight. He was living
with his grandfather; and grandfather,
determined to make young Lee an Eng-
lishman, often walked with him to school,
impressing upon him the virtues of an
English education, and the necessity to
work hard.
“He was a lively boy,” Lim San told
me. Mr Lim was one of his teachers.
“He was rather mischievous. A good
mixer. Not unduly studious, but he was
bright, very bright, and good in English.
That was his strong point.” At the end
of 1935, young Lee left to go to Raffles
Institution, founded more than a hun-
dred years ago by the great Imperialist
“that Singapore may be an intellectual as
well as the commercial entrepot of South-
east Asia”, where Lee quickly established
himself as a hard-working student. He
was usually at the top of his class, but
he did not ignore games, and even played
cricket. There is still in existence Lee’s
school record in which Mr Campos, a
teacher with commendable foresight, pre-
dicted that Lee Kuan Yew was destined
to “do well, unusually well. He is likely
.to attain a high place in life.”
Another of his teachers at Raffles
Institution was Lim Tay Boh, now Pro-
fessor of Economics at the University of
Singapore. In 1938, Professor Lim taught
Lee, and it was obvious then that Lee
was an outstanding scholar, especially
strong in English language and English
literature. At Raffles Institution Lee won
scholarships and prizes, and practically
the whole time he was there he domi-
nated the school in mathematics, and
with his fluent style in essay writing. He
was then a boy of 15.
Lee left Raffles Institution in 1939,
when war clouds were gathering in
Europe, thousands of miles away. Profes-
sor Lim recalls meeting Lee Kuan Yew
again, about this time, in Raffles College.
Lee became the professor’s student in
economics. Lee was reading an interest-
ing but difficult combination of sub-
jects economics, mathematics and
English literature. Professor Lim remem-
bers that Lee was proving himself an
able student in all these subjects, and was
beginning to make a name for himself
as an orator in Union debates, when the
Japanese bombed Singapore, and they
were at war! Not until after the war did
Professor Lim see Lee Kuan Yew again.
Lee, his education interrupted, the wish
of his grandfather still ringing in his
ears, quickly organised, once the Japan-
ese surrendered, what he called “an
atmosphere of study” for fellow students.
Lee, emerging as a leader, arranged a
meeting at his house, and invited Pro-
fessor Lim Tay Boh to give the first of

many informal lectures there. Later, Lee
carried out his grandfather’s ambition ■
and set sail for England, and Cambridge
University. But first he tried the London
School of Economics, but was unhappy
there, not considering busy London an
ideal place for concentrated study, and
he moved to the quieter climate of Cam-
bridge.
At Fitzwilliams, Lee Kuan Yew studied
law and did extremely well, finishing
first in the honors list, winning a star
for special distinction. By 1949, his
formal education completed “the
equal of any Englishman” Lee Kuan
Yew was ready to enter the political
arena, through the trade union move-
ment. His eye still focussed on merger and
Malaysia, as it had been when the Japan-
ese awakened his dormant Asian national-
ism, Lee moved relentlessly towards his
objective. By the time he was ready to
form the People’s Action Party in 1954,
Lee was legal adviser to more than 100
trade unions, and was renowned as the
organiser of a State postmen’s strike
which achieved its purpose through the
sympathy of a letter-less public.
Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malayan
nationalist, leader of the Malays, was
among those on the platform when Lee
Kuan Yew, on November 21, 1954, pro-
posed the formation of the People’s
Action Party. The whole of the Malayan
Peninsula was then under colonial rule,
and few people at that meeting thought
it possible that within three years the
Tunku would be the elected Prime Min-
ister of an independent Malaya. Lee’s
hand is revealed in the PAP Manifesto
which the inaugural meeting adopted,
and which still guides the party in prin-
ciple today.
Basic aim of the PAP was to secure
national freedom, without the use of
force. While an appeal was specifically
addressed to workers “we must reduce
inequalities of wealth and ensure that
workers by hand and brain get the full
fruits of their industry and enterprise”
there is no reference in the Mani-
festo to Socialism. This was deliberately
omitted so that every citizen, rich and
poor, employer and worker, could look
upon the PAP as a nationalist movement.
“We are also prepared to co-operate
with other political parties genuinely
interested in achieving real, not spur-
ious, independence for our country,”
stated the Manifesto.
Lee’s Anti-Communist Policy
VTobody has ever denied that Com-
munists then stood shoulder to
shoulder with the nationalists within
the PAP. Lee Kuan Yew was aware
of this. But, right from the start,
he made his position clear. He was
willing to form a united front with
anyone prepared to fight with him,
constitutionally, to rid Singapore and
Malaya of British control. Lee will
not listen to British protests that Britain
never intended to challenge independence,
and wished only to bring it about real-
istically and practically. Not believing
this, Lee and his party adopted a fighting
posture, and he still feels that the British
would never have handed over complete
government of the island to the local
people had they not, in effect, forced the
British to do so.
Lee Kuan Yew knew better than most
that when he accepted Communist sup-
port he was riding a most dangerous
tiger, and he was prepared for all the
insults and attacks which followed in
the Western Press. It was this decision,
and his subsequent careful, not always
head-on, tackling of other problems, suc-
cessfully, it transpires, which annoyed
the “which side are you on” type of
politician, and causes “Time” magazine
to this day to refer to him as Shifty Lee.
Lee expected the Communists within
the party ranks to make attempts to cap-
ture the party, and he will agree that
once they nearly did. What might have
happened to the PAP had not Tun Lim
Yew Hock, then Chief Minister, not step-
ped in and arrested half the Committee
on the grounds that they were Commun-
ists, will never be known. Lee was confi-
dent they would have been out-manoeuv-
red, and they were when he refused to
carry on as Secretary-General unless he
was backed up by a committee in which
he could have full confidence. Lee was
never prepared to become the tool of the
Communists, as David Marshall, the un-
fortunate first Chief Minister, was to be-
come right up until the Communists dis-
carded him as a useless instrument in the
1963 general elections. Forsaken by the
Communists, Marshall lost his deposit,
sadly faced with the truth that his own
supporters totalled no more than 416
voters.
Probably the only man ever to have
sat astride the Communist tiger in a
nationalist movement and survived,
having beaten the Communists to their
knees with a policy of open confronta-


tion, Lee knew that in the end the non-
Communist nationalists were bound to
clash with the Communists. He feared
this might happen after Malaysia, not
before, when the Communists, pretending
to be socialists, might be firmly entrench-
ed. To his amazement, and relief, the
Communitsts challenged him while Singa-
pore technically remained a British pos-
session with self-government. They mis-
timed and mis-judged, and one of the
reasons was the expulsion from the party
of the former treasurer, Australian-
trained accountant Ong Eng Guan.
After capturing the City Council, the
PAP had made Ong Eng Guan mayor of
the city. At once Ong became power-
crazy, and daily issued a stream of
orders which stunned everyone, except
childish extremists, with whom he became
popular, and nearly brought the city
facilities to a complete standstill. Un-
fortunately, the PAP tried to capitalise
on this popularity, and when, in 1959,
they won the general elections and form-
ed the government, Lee Kuan Yew made
Ong Minister for National Development,
gave him control of city installations,
and entrusted him with the acute problem
of providing the people with houses.
Ong was not fitted for the task, and
he never put up a single dwelling. In
a public inquiry, a judge described him
as a man capable of telling an untruth
when it suited him, and evidence revealed
that he had given his friends jobs. In
the end, Lee took over, and, within a
short while, the Government achieved
deserved international fame for the speed
with which thousands of low-cost hous-
ing units were erected. But the damage
had been done. Angry at his dismissal,
Ong attacked Lee’s leadership, taking an
extreme Left line. Expelled from the
party, Ong Eng Guan resigned his
Assembly seat and, promising his China-
town voters heaven on earth, he trium-
phantly, and soundly, defeated the PAP
candidate. This was when the pro-Com-
munists in the PAP made their fatal
mistake. They thought that Ong, and his
new party, might snatch the extreme Left
initiative from them. They threatened
Lee, demanding that he should follow
their line. Lee refused, and, in another
by-election, the pro-Communists threw
their weight at the last moment over to
David Marshall, then chairman of the
so-called Workers’ Party. Lee was to be
taught a lesson.
“Lee walks like a duck.”
Dy a narrow majority, Marshall was
swept into the Assembly again, and
the pro-Communists waited confidently
for Lee Kuan Yew to give way. Lee stood
fast. He declined to be intimidated. In-
stead, he accepted the challenge in the
Assembly, and called for a vote of con-
fidence. Pro-Communists, waverers and
opportunists within the PAP abstained:
the national united front was broken.
Shortly afterwards, the deserters formed
the Barisan Sosialis (Socialist Front), and
the antagonists stood where the lines were
drawn.
For two years the Right votes of Tun
Lim Yew Hock kept Lee Kuan Yew in
power, but, in the end, it was Lee him-
self who decided the date of the general
elections. Seldom, in parliamentary his-
tory, could there have been a more
masterly performance. With supreme
confidence, having brought about merger
and Malaysia, as dreamt of more than
a decade before, Lee Kuan Yew went to
the people seeking approval to continue
his work.
Five or six years ago, when Lee’s PAP,
firmly believing in the need for an anti-
colonial united front with Communist
elements, was being severely criticised,
Australian journalists and politicians,
convinced that Lee was playing a danger-
ous game, suspicious of the man himself,
joined in the criticism. Said one Aus-
tralian: “Lee walks like a duck. He
quacks like a duck. He is a duck.” Lee
does walk in a deliberate and distinctive
manner: he puts his feet down carefully,
and his body, like his whole per-
sonality, moves forward aggressively.
But he is no duck. And neither
does he deserve to be known as
being unfavorably disposed towards
Australia or Australians. He has clashed
with a couple of Australian journalists,
one because of persistent questioning in
depth, and he did remark angrily and
loudly that he was annoyed when he
thought that certain Australians were
interfering in the formation of Malaysia.
But to pretend that he is anti-Australian
is not to understand a man fully aware
of the political and military realities of
life. Lee is pro-Asian and he is politically
inclined towards neutrality, co-existence
and the need for smaller States to work
together as much as possible to prevent
themselves being exploited by the larger
powers. He gets along well, in conse-
quence, with Prince Sihanouk, of Cam-
bodia. All this does not make him un-
friendly towards Australia, or to any
Country. If Lee considers British diplo-
mats, merchants, and journalists to be
smoother, more polished, more confi-
dent, and less brash than the pushful
Australian this may be because of Lee’s
long association with the British, and the
good fortune of himself and the British
that, in Cambridge, the kindness and
learning of his tutors and lecturers left
upon him an enduring impression of
what is best in Britain
“The Dynamic Mind”
VTo man in Malaysia is more conscious
' than Lee Kuan Yew of the impact
of Communism upon the largely Chinese
population in Singapore. He studied
Communism carefully during his student
days in London, and he finally con-
cluded, after deep thought, that this
ruthless discipline was unnecessary for
the development of Malaya. He was wil-
ling to listen to arguments that, in some
form, Communism might be best for
China or the Soviet Union. But not for
Malaya. He thought the English-educated
in Malaya, for many reasons, had a duty
to help bring about social cohesion and
to lead the fight against colonialism and
to guard against Communism. For, he
argued, whatever the rights and wrongs
of Communism, no one could deny the
tremendous appeal it made upon Asian
masses. He told students in London 13
years ago that they could not insulate
themselves from the nationalist revolts
that swept the European powers from
Asia. They had to participate. They had
to provide a reasonable alternative to
Communism. That was 13 years ago:
Lee has always had this sense of history,
of being able to look forward as well
as to remember the past. He possesses
an awareness of political develop-
ments and trends in the newly emergent
Afro-Asian not based upon doctrine as
much as a study of events. If he has a
fault in this direction, it is his anxiety
constantly to “analyse the current situa-
tion”. This is an absorbing, and not
always rewarding, occupation Yet, if
criticised, he could with justification
claim many brilliant perceptions, many
instances when his interpretations of
likely developments have been proved
uncannily correct.
Lee’s deep interest, therefore, in
foreign affairs is understandable, and,
once he was Prime Minister and firmly in
the saddle, and work began on the more
pressing domestic problems, Lee went
abroad, making contact with other Afro-
Asian leaders, creating friendships, tell-
ing them about Singapore and Malaysia,
exchanging ideas, learning, gaining more
knowledge. On these tours he has had
long and useful talks with Nehru,
Ne Win, Sihanouk, Nasser, Tito, Ayub
Khan, Soekarno, and a host of others.
This, then, is the man Lee Kuan Yew,
whom Fenner Brockway, veteran British
Leftist MP, described in the House of
Commons as “one of the outstanding
dynamic minds in world statesmanship
today”.

Christians, Auschwitz and Jews
The tap-roots of antisemitism have not been touched
By ISI LEIBLER
Hiroshima has established itself as
the symbol of mass destruction
and death through the medium of
our technological progress. For a world
constantly on the brink of a nuclear
holocaust, Hiroshima is more than rele-
vant even if cynical “Peace Medal-
list” professionals as well as genuine
humanitarians utilise its symbolism.
But Auschwitz representing as it
does the ultimate in man’s inhumanity
to man does not trigger off Hiroshima-
like conscience-stricken reactions. Yet,
representing as it does the efficiency of
the Nazi genocide extermination pro-
gramme, Auschwitz claimed far more
victims numerically than Hiroshima.
Moreover, death in Auschwitz, unlike
in Hiroshima, was not sudden and im-
personal it consisted of a slow process
of personal degradation and dehumanisa-
tion, in which the gas chamber and
crematorium were only the ultimate in
an infinite series of individual acts of
systematic murder.
But there are no world-wide Ausch-
witz commemorations, marches or poli-
tical agitation. With the exception of
survivors, relatives, or close ethnic kin,
the world has found it more palliative
to erase Auschwitz as an active symbol
and has largely relegated it to the index
pages of contemporary history books.
In this respect Jews are, of course,
an exception. Auschwitz for them cannot
be mentally erased because it has become
a revelant personal factor in the life of
practically every individual Western Jew.
Auschwitz has had, however, some
effect, if only indirectly. Even if memor-
ies of Auschwitz as a symbol in the ulti-
mate degradation of mankind are some-
what dimmed the liquidation of six
million European Jews has made anti-
semitism somewhat unfashionable in re-
sponsible quarters.
It is true that in Australia, as in
other parts of the world, there are still
isolated pockets of semi-demented indi-
viduals describing themselve„ as Nazi
elite groups smearing swastikas on
synagogues, distributing pornographic
anti-semitic literature, and pledging them-
selves to finish off Hitler's unfinished
mission. But anti-semitic or neo-Nazi
groups are not really significant in the
wide sense. In general the main political
parties, the Churches, and all major
groups in our society have made it abun-
dantly clear that anti-semitism is un-
acceptable and that racial bigots of any
type deny themselves entry to the parlors
of respectable society and the “Estab-
lishment.”
Yet if all Auschwitz has taught the
world is a passive rejection of lunatic
anti-semitic group activities and the rele-
gation of snide anti-semitic remarks from
the cocktail reception, there must surely
be some uneasiness and twinges of con-
science in these sections of the com-
munity which are considered the guard-
ians and collective repositories of our
moral and spiritual values.
So it is right that this burden of re-
sponsibility falls primarily on the Christ-
ian Churches, because it is particularly
relevant that Auschwitz should be. im-
bedded in the conscience of Christianity.
For it must be realised that Hitler’s par-
anoid anti-semitism and unspeakably
primeval solution to the Jewish problem
was not a sudden reversal to barbarism.
Its origins can be traced to the out-
growth of nearly 2000 years of Christian-
Jewish “dialogue.”
One does not have to recount the his-
torical anguish of the Jewish people in
Christian Europe. It is in considerable
part a notorious record of exclusion,
persecution and physical extermination.
As many Jews were killed over 20 cen-
turies of Christian hegemony in Europe
as perished under the Nazis.
Hitler’s ‘'phantom Jewish conspiracy”
theme grew in fertile soil nourished by a
growth that was very much a direct in-
heritance of the demonic Christ-killing
Jewish image developed during the
Middle Ages. The obscene and ghoulish
mythical Jew outlined in early Christian
writings and ultimately puffed out of
proportion, supplanted the real Jew in
the Mediaeval mind until that Jew
ceased to exist the only Jew still
recognised being a figment of the imagi-
nation. This distorted “popular” image
of the Jew was inherited and absorbed
by nineteenth-century secular anti-semitic
folklore. It culminated in the reality of
Auschwitz.
It is therefore understandable that
Jewish survivors of the Nazi holocaust
are inclined to some scepticism and tend
to react with sophistication to present-
day Christian affirmations of brotherly
love and exhortations against anti-
semitism.
The often quoted pronouncement made
in 1938 by Pope Pius XI that “spiritu-
ally we are all Semites” had little impact
on most East European clergy who em-
bodied in full the anti-semilic hostility
prevalent amongst the masses.
The great German Protestant and
Catholic Churches (with notable excep-
tions) did not struggle against Nazism,
as to their credit they do today against
Communism.
Recent events may make these views
appear uncharitable. The late Pope John
XXIII was particularly active in at-
tempts to achieve a breakthrough to
happier Christian-Jewish relations. By

THE HOUSE OF 'EDGEWORTH. Virginia, U.S.A.
introducing a series of revisions to the
liturgy and eliminating particular pas-
sages grossly offensive to Jews, Pope
John may well have initiated what could
be the start of a radical change of atti-
tude by the Church in this field. It is
significant that Pope Paul VI has given
every indication that he intends con-
tinuing his predecessor’s efforts in this
direction.
A similar spirit also seems to pervade
the Protestant Churches who adopted a
strong resolution condemning anti-
semitism at their Ecumenical Assembly
in New Delhi.
•T'he Churches’ recent effort to gener-
ate a better relationship are particu-
larly noticeable in Australia. The recently
re-established “Council for Christians and
Jews” and the frequent interchange of
Christian and Jewish speakers all point
to genuine efforts by Australian Churches
to promote friendly relations.
The activities of the Australian Catho-
lic Church have been very noticeable
in this field. Over the last few years all
sections of the Catholic Press have par-
ticipated in what has become a well-
organised educational campaign to break
down latent or real anti-semitic ten-
dencies among Australian Catholics.
Scarcely a week goes by without at least
one Australian Catholic publication de-
voting an article to Christian-Jewish
relations.
Taking account of these and other
efforts by the Churches to combat anti-
semitism, one might well be tempted to
conclude that 2000 years of bitterness
between the Church and the Synagogue
have come to an end. Yet this is not the
case, for the real roots of “Christian”
anti-semitism remain largely untouched.
The tap-roots of anti-semitism in
Christian countries still originate in the
early theological education of Christian
children. Most children meet their first
Jews in their New Testament education.
Here they are frequently left with an
image of Jews as evil and monstrous
Christ killers crucifiers of the Savior,
who, by their evil act, have incurred the
wrath of the Almighty and are eternally
damned.
Many children therefore receive an
early theological heritage which leaves
them with an instinctive antagonism to
Jews which frequently outlasts their re-
ligious educational influences. Often
their antipathy and distrust of Jews
the origin of which has already slipped
their memories become the expres-
sion of instinctive knowledge. They then
readily grasp theories of a more refined
anti-semitic nature which are calculated
to rationalise or justify their prejudices.
Recent studies undertaken in America
and in Europe have confirmed that
catechisms and textbooks (Protestant and

Catholic) still convey to young children
impressions which inculcate them with
the belief that the Jews, by killing Christ,
are cursed and damned. Unless there is
evidence to the contrary, one is tempted
to assume that a similar Australian pat-
tern prevails.
A recent trend on the part of some
Churches calling on their congregants
to show “love” instead of “hate” to
Jews is of dubious advantage. The belief
is still inculcated that Jews are accursed
for killing Christ but “love” is de-
scribed as a far more effective technique
of converting Jews than persecution or
hatred. Most Jews would naturally con-
sider this as an insulting and arrogant
approach. It certainly does not encourage
acceptance of cultural pluralism which
presupposes equal treatment to minorities
because they are different. Above all
such attitudes still demand that the Jew
remains the object of an action “love”
instead of “hate” but nonetheless still
an object to be converted. On the basis
of this teaching the Jew is still the same.
What is therefore badly needed is a
thorough soul-searching on the part of
Christian educationalists. Whether re-
visions are warranted or possible are de-
cisions which the Churches themselves
alone can make. But let it be noted
that the dominant negative images of
the Jew in Christian theology do in
fact mainly reflect stereotypes of earlier
Christian history. Pope John XXIII has
already demonstrated the ability of the
Catholic Church to deal with such prob-
lems without theological compromise or
drastic review.
In recent years many noted Christian
scholars have highlighted the inconsis-
tencies in attributing the collective death
of Jesus on Jews; many have also stressed
that the concept of the eternal damnation
of the Jews is not part of Christian
dogma. Other Christian educationalists
maintain that the Jewishness of Christ
and the common background of the Old
Testament are all insufficiently high-
lighted at the expense of Passion Plays.
The subject of Jews, as interpreted by
Christian dogma, is obviously difficult
terrain for a Jew to cover. It is in the
last resort a Christian problem.
But if the distorted image of the Jew
in Christian education is to be reviewed
in the light of Auschwitz and the reality
of the twentieth century, there is a good
chance that this decade may well see a
really significant breakthrough in Chris-
tian-Jewish relations a breakthrough
which would undoubtedly largely elim-
inate one of the basic and most per-
sistent sources of anti-semitism over the
last 2000 years.
John Bull in the
Looking-Glass
By ALFRED SHERMAN
The self satisfaction which charac-
terised Englishmen of most classes
for generations has gone a long
way towards collapsing during the past
decade. “What’s wrong with Britain?”
has come close to becoming a parlor
game. But lacking a tradition of national
self-criticism, many critics have veered
towards an orgy of self-deprecation and
self-hate which are even less helpful than
the self-satisfaction they replaced, the
more so because the underlying self-
righteousness shapes both extremes. Since
political attitudes invariably contain
personal involvement, there is always a
danger of the enjoyment of national self-
denigration, accompanied by personal
self-exculpation and dissociation; this can
be no less an obstacle to analysis and
reform than undue self-satisfaction had
previously been.
These considerations make the appear-
ance of John Mander’s book “Great
Britain or Little England” as a mass cir-
culation paperback all the more gratify-
ing. John Mander is concerned to pin-
point the ills in order to propose reme-
dies, in full confidence that these can be
worked out and applied. But his essay
is of far more than British domestic in-
terest. To discuss the mood of neutralism
and compulsive identification with “non-
aligned'” countries which characterises a
large part of the British Left, but not
only the Left, Mr Mander examines non-
alignment itself.
Mr Mander hinges his study of non-
alignment on its manifest results as they
impinged on India during the Sino-In-
dian war, whose moral a great many
people both in Britain and abroad have
shirked. When India was attacked by
China, Mr Nehru and his supporters,
who constituted a majority of politically-
articulate Indians, expected a measure
of moral and political support from their
fellow non-aligned Afro-Asians: they
were shocked to find the latter non-
aligned in this conflict, too.
This, the author points out, was in-
herent in the nature of non-alignment.
On the face of it, non-alignment both


appeared morally superior to cold-war
commitment and seemed to confer added
strength to its devotees, making them
something of arbiters in the quarrel and
giving them unity of purpose. But, in
fact, non-alignment is not positively
moral, because it does not seek the
merits of any particular case, but on the
contrary deliberately avoids studying the
merits of any case in order that it can
remain uninvolved and neutral, in short:
moral indifferentism. The non-aligned
cannot be arbiters, because they exploit
the balance of power between the con-
tending blocs, and depend on it. Indeed,
the end or any modification of the cold
war might signal the end' of the benefits
it brings.
“A judge, an arbiter, must be the re-
pository of wisdom, impartiality and
justice ... Is there not a contradiction
between the role of arbiter and the
neutrality to which the non-aligned
statesman is pledged? As an arbiter, he
must choose the good. As a neutral, he
can have no opinion.”
India learned by bitter experience
that “non-alignment is not collective
security. The essence of non-alignment
is to mediate between the existing power
blocs, not to set up a new power bloc,”
which the countries in question could
not do anyway . . . The day that Dr
Nkrumah wrote to Mr Macmillan in-
sisting that he send arms “to neither
side,” in the Sino-Indian war, Indian eyes
were opened to the fact that “the logic
of the median position favors the ag-
gressor . . . especially . . . where the
aggressor is known for his ruthlessness
and the victim for his moral sensitivity.”
In fact, non-alignment positively encour-
ages ruthlessness in power blocs,
that is to say since the further they
go, the further the non-aligned will lean
over to meet them half way. Yet India’s
disillusionment will not mean the end
of non-alignment elsewhere. “Just as the
strength of non-alignment is not the sum
of its members, so the subtraction of a
member . . . does not destroy it. The
factors making for the non-alignment of
India and Ceylon still operate ...”
Non-alignment is femininity
A short review can only scratch the
surface of what is a continuous and
sophisticated argument. Mr Mander no-
where preaches to the uncommitted coun-
tries, but confines himself to analysing
their position and tracing its implica-
tions. His strictures and advice or ex-
hortation are reserved for his British
compatriots, and his analysis of the para-
doxes of non-alignment provides a valu-
able key to their disorders. Non-align-
ment, he writes, reflects a feminine and
passive attitude towards major world
events. Its adoption by newly-created
Afro-Asian states which are very con-
scious of their sovereignty and do not
wish to compromise it by alliances in
the sense that any alliance limits sover-
eignty in some respects in order to gain
wider benefits or safeguards is under-
standable in this context. But how can
one explain a desire to imitate Afro-
Asian states by the Left wing in a major
world power, with advice to follow India,
or Ireland, and to leave NATO for the
shelter of the “New Commonwealth”
which would manifestly not lift a finger
to save Britain after turning its back on
its erstwhile doyen, India? The answer
lies in their desire to “withdraw” from a
difficult struggle, abandon the burden
of responsibility, give up the realities of
power for cosy conference-cavorting,
flying from one gathering to the next,
making highly emotional declarations
against entanglements, colonialism, and
other betes noires.
Mr Mander shows that this compul-
sive neutralism is not really new. He
takes a dip into the thirties, when other-
wise seemingly-intelligent people deluded
themselves into believing the most utter
nonsense about the Soviet Union, that
the food and housing problems had been
solved ushering in the age of abundance,
that freedom and justice reigned (during
the purges of the mid-19305), that the
peasants and workers enthusiastically and
actively controlled their own destinies.
There was a time when it seemed that
the shock of the 19505, the disclosures
from the Soviet side that everything said
against the regime had been true after
all, the souring of “brave new worlds”
one after the other in four continents,
and finally the fratricidal struggle be-
tween the Communist bloc members,
would end the age of illusions. But it ap-
pears that such illusions seem to meet a
deep-felt need among that kind of per-
son. The author shows basic similarities
between “progressive” syndromes, and
the neutralism, anti-Americanism and
Commonwealth-fixations on the Right.
This is really quite understandable,
since both attitudes spring from frustra-
tion. The more extreme conservative is
no less of an ideologist and Utopian than
the committed Left-winger. The first be-
lieves that his Utopia existed until re-
cently and can be re-created by an act
of will if only recent excrescences can
be removed. The latter believes that his
Utopia is just round the corner and can
be achieved if only he carries through
a once-and-for-all programme, throws off
entanglements, etc. Both tend to look
askance at Americans and “Continen-
tals,” i.e. Europeans, whom they blame
for whatever features of British life and
predicament upset them most. The Left
sees in the US the bastion of the Right;
the Right-wing Utopian sees in it a sol-
vent of traditional enemies or unreliable
allies; the Left-wing opponent of Euro-
pean unity sees it as a rich man’s club
seducing Britain away from her real duty
to assimilate to the non-aligned Afro-
Asian world. Naturally, with these pre-
occupations, both the Labor Left and the
Tory Right regard the cold war and
Communism as a decoy invented by
Americans or Europeans to distract Bri-
tain’s attention from its mystic role in
the Commonwealth.
Right, Left, Centre—panic-stricken
]V/fR Mander takes his analysis a stage
further by demonstrating that the
recent spate of appeals for a “sense of
national purpose” is another manifesta-
tion of this abdication of personal re-
sponsibility. To ask the Government to
set the nation’s purpose is the antithesis
of democracy, in which the Government
reflects and implements the nation’s will.
If the members of the nation have no
sense of purpose individually, or col-
lectively, purpose imposed on them from
above would be sad indeed.
I have left the book’s opening chapter
to the end. It deals with “Cuba week,”
when the majority of British press and
public was caught off balance. Most of
the Right and Centre, with a few hon-
orable exceptions, sounded exactly like
the Left, in that they were panic-stricken,
they prejudged the issue against the US
and within the course of a week had
to recognise that they had been utterly
mistaken. (Most of them denied that
there were any missiles in Cuba, and
attributed the whole thing to US internal
politics. Only later, when the Soviet
admission and withdrawal made con-
tinued criticism of the US action appear
more Russian than Khrushchev or
perhaps one should now say more Chi-
nese than Mao were they obliged to
recant, though some refused to do even
that.)
Mr Mander sees an inseparable con-
nection between Britain’s neutralism and
its lack of purpose and weight in the
world. He sees the remedy for both in a
strongly European orientation. What is
the use of Britain's continuing to hanker
after leadership of the Commonwealth,
he asks, when the Commonwealth points
in all directions, and Britain is not clear
about the direction in which it wishes
to lead anyway?
He sees the answer not in imitating
de Gaulle, since the British character as
he describes it is considerably different
from that of the European and is likely
to remain so throughout the foreseeable
future, but in a Britain determined to
enter Europe, to peacefully compete with
France for its leadership, and to make
its own distinctive contribution to a
Europe-plus-Britain.

THE REPUBLICANS
Sir,
I enjoyed “Batman’s” good-humored
and good-natured article on the Aus-
tralian Republican Party (28/9/63). But,
candidly, I must confess that some of
our members thought that “Batman”
wrote with a pen in one hand and a
knife in the other.
Most parties in their early history lost
their deposits, as did the ALP and the
DLP, and, unfortunately, the Republican
Party is no exception. Mr R. H. Grainger
gained 11,955 votes, and lost his deposit
by only 146 votes, and not by 549 votes.
Yet, when requested, Mr Rylah refused
to hand back the candidate’s deposit. As
a man qualified in law, I think I am
entitled to point the inconsistency in the
application of the law. If the law was
waived in favor of the 20,000 who did
not vote, then it should be waived in
favor of the Republican candidate; or
alternatively, if the law was applied
against the Republican candidate, it
should likewise be applied against the
non-voters.
The Republicans cannot win an
election until they get the publicity, and
the Press, radio and television will not
give them the publicity until they win.
The Melbourne West campaign was
virtually boycotted by the Press, radio
and television. This is a bad sign for the
future of a so-called democracy.
I have yet to encounter a genuine
Republican who is anti-British or anti-
royal. Republicans are pro-Australia.

ABORTION
Sir,
The report of the NSW Humanist
Society entitled “Abortion: The Facts”
(5/10/63) is to be commended on the
effort made to present these facts. How-
ever, the conclusions drawn after the
presentation display a very inadequate
knowledge of “basic individual rights”,
which it endeavours to defend. The
truth of the quotation of Mr Justic Mc-
Cardie, “I cannot think that it is right
that a woman should be forced to bear a
child against her will,” would not be
questioned, except that we must realise
that the time for the choice of whether
a child is wanted or not is not during
the pregnancy but before.
However, should the decision be made
and a child result, then as well as her
basic individual rights, we also have the
basic individual rights of the child, of
which the most fundamental is its right
to life. Anybody who then, knowingly,
terminates the life of this individual is
thereby guilty of murder. So I would
suggest that the Humanist Society
examine the basic individual rights in
their correct perspective, before equating
two obviously unequal rights.

“PLAYBOY”
Sir,
Some weeks ago I read in The
Bulletin that Victoria had banned the
magazine “Playboy”, but that the publi-
cation was still on sale in NSW. Quite
by chance I have learned that the maga-
zine is not available in this State because
of the ban imposed by the Victorian
authorities.
The nature or substance of the maga-
zine is immaterial to the very important
matter of principle involved in this
situation. By what right does the State
of Victoria have the power to prohibit
the distribution of any article in another
State, even though (as I believe is the
case in this instance) the point of entry
happens to be Melbourne, for onward
transmission to other States? If the ban
in question is a Federal ban, then there
the matter ends. But if, as I understand,
the prohibition arose solely in Victoria,
then it is high time someone did some-
thing about a situation which is quite
unconstitutional.
I have often pondered on the possibility
of this sort of thing arising with more
serious matters at stake, but here,
apparently, is a definite case which needs
investigation.

RESTRICTIVE TRADE BILL
Sir,
Roger Randerson (The Case against a
Restrictive Trade Bill, 14/9/63) should
tell the whole story about “the isolated
case of an unbalanced Dutch migrant
who burned his factory in South Austra-
lia . . .” before stating that it is a “poor
reason” for proposals contained in the
Bill. A survey of what caused Adrianus
Alfonsus Johannes Mollemans to become
unbalanced would make interesting read-
ing.
Perhaps Mr Randerson may be inter-
ested in the comments made by the
learned judge who presided at the trial
in the Adelaide Supreme Court in June
this year. His Honor Mr Justice Travers
commented on the fact that a migrant
can legally become Prime Minister of
Australia the day following his naturali-
sation, but has to wait a further 10 years
before he can become a member of the
particular body, lack of whose member-
ship made Mollemans unable to carry on
his trade. His Honor also stated that
the law should not permit such discrimi-
nation, and expressed doubts whether in-
tending migrants were informed that
such discrimination did in fact exist.
As to the claim that "opportunities for
people to start business are greater in
Australia than in most parts of the
world”, it would be interesting to know
what research Mr Randerson has under-
taken in order to make such a claim
which, to me at least, appears to be un-
substantiated. Opportunities are not
lacking in a young country which is going
through a period of unprecedented pros-
perity. This is as it should be: I doubt,
however, whether Mr Randerson has
made enquiries “in most parts of the
world” or whether in fact he has gone
further in his enquiries than the few
success stories amply publicised by the
Press.

THE ORRS
Sir,
I feel that you and others who have
criticised the Department of Immigra-
tion for its refusal to allow Mr and Mrs
Harold Orr to remain in Australia have
completely lost sight of one important
factor the treatment accorded the
Orrs does not differ in the slightest man-
ner from that accorded in similar cir-
cumstances to Australian visitors to the
USA.
Any Australian who enters the USA
on a non-immigrant visa could not
normally convert his status to immigrant
status while he is in the country. He
would have to leave the USA and then
re-apply for entry on an immigrant visa.
If he had been there as an exchange
visitor, he would suffer from the further
provision that he could not re-apply
until he had resided for at least two
years in his home country. In any case, he
would have to wait a long time for an
immigrant visa, for the quota for people
born in Australia is small.

CORRECTIONS
Sir,
May I correct a few errors in Marga-
ret Clarke’s article, “ ‘New’ Works by
Old Composers” (5/10/63). I spoke
about a change of attitude towards musi-
cal interpretation in general in the past
fifty not few years. In recent years
new, reliable editions of Mozart and Hay-
den are helping to give a clearer pic-
ture of these two composers in particu-
lar.
Not Liszt’s “Bagatelle Without Tonal-
ity”, but his “Czardas Macabre”, has
been composed from fragments.
I was placed third in the Busoni Com-
petition. I never pretended to have won
the Busoni Prize; this misinformation
seems to stem from the blurb on the
sleeves of some of my earlier records.

The Private Ear and The Public Eye.
Peter Shaffer. Union Theatre Reper-

“JFhe Last of the Rainbow,” which
won the £lOOO Manifold Prize in
1962, is about a group of young people
who call themselves “Scraggs,” living in
a disused Melbourne pub called “The
Rainbow,” which is about to be pulled
down. There is a painter, a poet, a
singer, a dancer, and little Jan, a girl.
John Hepworth has great facility with
words, unhampered, in this play by any
discipline of plot, theme or character
development. The dialogue beats relent-
lessly against the audience. None of the
characters ever speaks below a shout.
They bound about the stage and burst
into song or dance with tireless and
exhausting energy. Life in “The Rain-
bow” is a continuous noisy party.
Comment is provided by a one-man
chorus: an Italian migrant who is dis-
mantling the roof. He keeps popping
down the ladder to give us an instal-
ment of his philosophy of life. He tells
us that to understand people we must
look down on them from above. Since
this viewpoint is a monopoly of wreck-
ers, God and the birds, the advice does
not seem very helpful.
Wal Cherry’s production is commend-
ably athletic.
“A Touch of the Poet,” set in a
run-down tavern near Boston in 1828,
is about the cruelties and self-deceptions
of family life. In this it resembles “Long
Day’s Journey into Night,” but is softer,
romanticised and much inferior. Having
seen a very tedious performance of the
play in Oxford last year, I was amazed
to find how much more life it had in
Irene Mitchell’s production. Norman
Kaye gives a sensitive performance as
the fastidious Cornelius Melody, ex-
Major in Wellington’s army, who lives
in the past while his wife and daughter
slave to keep him and his thoroughbred
mare. Julia Blake is spirited as his proud
daughter who despises her father’s self-
deceptions.
In “Private Ear” a sensitive clerk asks
a dumb but pretty typist to dinner in
his bed-sitting room. He also invites his
flash friend Ted to help talk to Doreen.
This is a mistake because Ted takes
over Doreen. In “The Public Eye” a
middle-aged chartered accountant hires
a private detective to shadow his young
wife, because he wrongly believes she
has a lover. She falls in love with the
private eye. Competently produced by
Malcolm Robertson, these plays are
lively and talented, but inescapably
middlebrow. Under the pretence of deal-
ing seriously and sympathetically with
genuine problems, Shaffer is in fact ex-
ploiting pseudo-problems. The shy clerk
is presented as too sensitive to succeed
in a crass and cruel world, but his real
problem is that he is bemused by ro-
mantic dreams and cliches which make
him a pathetic figure, unable to recog-
nise a shallow typist and a brash friend
for what they are.
Tn “The Public Eye” the wife, Belinda,
is also an innocent Her husband is
“intellectual,” formal and stuffy. Shaffer
sees Belinda’s gourmandising on ice-
cream sundaes and horror films as a
triumph of the warm heart and free
mind. Surely it is just the triumph of
the adolescent digestion.
George Whaley and Frances Mc-
Donald play the earthbound Ted and
Doreen with excellent vulgarity. Brian
James is delightful as the eccentric pri-
vate eye, and Gerda Nicolson is a gay
Belinda. David Mitchell as the sensitive
clerk and Syd Conabere as the stuffy
husband have more difficult tasks, due
to a failure on the part of the dramatist.

Tf you wish to understand the essence
of the southern states of the US
and from what roots their troubles stem
I can recommend Robert Levis’ cur-
rent production at the Independent.
The South’s troubles are not perhaps
the main intent of Mr Williams; his
name theme is that of the sweet bird of
youth, the charming creature that stays
with us too short a time for us even to
know what it is all about. This is the
bird that carries beauty with it and
lost beauty is the terrifying nightmare
of the ageing actress, particularly the
cinema star. For her, the minor ravages
of even a few years of time make up
the major tragedy one wrinkle in the
giant close-up and the image has van-
ished. The perilous, transient beauty has
flown.
This is, as I see it, the playwright’s
main theme, but he also has a surgeon’s
dissection of the degradation, the sex-
envy, the false idealisation of woman,
the mob violence of the South. His “Boss
Finley” could translate to an Alabama
governor without one proof - reader’s
mark. The speeches come fresh from
Birmingham and Ol’ Miss.
There are shortcomings in the pro-
duction: Jacqueline Kott makes a fine
bid at a role which needs a supreme
actress, and Miss Kott is not that. But
she is moving and sincere. As the southern
town's best and brightest boy, who be-
comes a predictable failure in life
(though not in bed), Allan Lander gives
a sharply concentrated performance.
Mr Levis seems to be a producer of
intellect and resource. Even though his
marching girls fail to come off, and his
pace is still too slow, he is very much
worth Sydney theatre's attention.
I note the Arts Council's Metropolitan
Drama Festival merely to record, once
more, my opposition to the whole
rondelay. I do not think the effort does
one thing for Sydney's theatre
though it does help to perpetuate that
noxious weed of our city’s amateur stage,

and made an award each year for the

The New Theatre, to be fair,

Blake Prize
Blake Prize, 1963. Commonwealth
Trading Bank. Sydney.
Tn a sense, this show underlines the
A secular nature of contemporary art
which acquires a semblance of religiosity
through private passion alone. The
difficulty of injecting wide meanings
into private symbolism is exemplified in
Len French's winning painting, broad,
handsomely colored and textured as it is
yet only loosely connected with
traditional forms and even they fail to
put over any clear message. The judges’
reasoning on this score was obviously
to choose what they considered a good
painting. After all divine and human
creativity are related, and if all else fails
at least we can respect that! The
lamentable fact remains—symbols may
be rediscovered but they can’t be cooked
up.
John Coburn’s entries, including the
Crucifixion which won the d’Arcy Morris
memorial, ring with an intensity which
informs shapes and tones with acceptable
candor. Few other painters achieve
this consistency, especially those who
threw in just another abstract with a
new name, or no name, as Louis James
whose rather beautiful paintings,
lusciously sensuous, surely have little to
do with the Blake. Peascod shows a
vision of matter, Greenhill a mixed com-
position with some highly moving
passages, and Kmit two heads of Christ,
not quite as good as previous winning
work. A number of painters are not up
to the realisation of rather good ideas,
Kenneth Jade, for instance, and between
the sweet and the sick others have been
challenged to real effort. Australians
have responded to this challenge with
interesting results over the last decade
often with no help or encouragement.
This is sufficient to justify the con-
tinuance of the Blake.

Donald Laycock. South Yarra Gallery.
Melbourne.
Melbourne art hasn't had a better
week for a long time. While Olsen
was still showing at the Australian Gal-
leries, Len French opened at the Argus,
Norma Redpath at Gallery A and Don
Laycock at the South Yarra Gallery.
Norma Redpath’s is a truly imposing
exhibition. I believe it is the only solo
shows she has held, and the massive
size of the five big pieces suggests that
it will be pretty hard to get the show
anywhere else. Two of the big pieces
are in bronze, and the remaining three
in plaster waiting to be cast. Besides
these there are several delightful
bronzetti.
She has a most confident control
over scale, and even her tiny bronzetti,
with their intricate planes and enclo-
sures, sit solidy in an ample space.
Moreover it is direct and fairly simple
in its basic conceptions of subject and
treatment. She draws on nature and
evokes both the grotesque and the har-
monious in solid, natural objects. It is
sculpture which considers and exploits
space, mass and surface with equal and
telling skill.
Leonard French’s exhibition of draw-
ings is presented largely as an indication
of the painting he is working on at
present. The interest of the show lies
in the trend of French’s ideas, and es-
pecially in those drawings which are
clearly quite close to coming paintings.
Following the Campion series, French
returned to symbols of creation, growth
and renewal. Out of these another series
is emerging based on the seven days
of creation. The drawings for this series
are very well developed, and could in
fact pass for unfinished paintings to
anyone unacquainted with the luxurious
surfaces and colors of a finished French
painting. As it is they are accurate sket-
ches of what promises to be a striking
and powerful series. The basic symbols
and forms of circle, fish, bird, plant and
man are still French's main material.
He is using them with increasing
subtlety and generally greater freedom.
They move smoothly, having lost some
of their mechanical stiffness, and I think
they achieve a greater breadth of mean-
ing by being used in a much less literal
way than they were, say, in the Cam-
pion series.
From his huge and ancient head
studies, Don Laycock has turned to a
kind of romantic abstraction. The tran-
sition can be observed in a couple of
paintings, especially the rather banal
“Mt. Olympus.” His present work is
beautifully colored, fluid painting which
evokes images of galactic spaces and
marine depths but very little that is in
any way substantial. It is handsome
painting in impeccable taste, but what
it is about is not at all clear. Laycock
is a painter of manifest talent. He has
not yet fully realised on his talent, and
there is evidence in his sudden changes
that he is aware of this. His present
work, too, is an interregnum a pleas-
ant one but not (I hope) too protracted.

|Ane of the most vigorous of modern
directors, Andre Cayatte has never
run much risk of being swept away by
the Nouvelle Vague (now dying away to
a small lapping in various backwaters).
He prefers the strong and constant tide
of traditional cinema.
In “Le Passage du Rhin” the theme is
man’s personal liberty. To embody his
argument, Cayatte takes two Parisians —
a crusading journalist and a subdued,
mildly henpecked pastrycook—who meet
as POWs soon after the fall of France.
Sent as farm-workers to a German vil-
lage, the two face the situation according
to their characters. The journalist,
wedded to a grandiose, romantic idea of
freedom, escapes to fight for it at the
expense of people who have loved and
trusted him. The pastrycook finds more
genuine liberty in his life in Germany,
where he becomes accepted as an in-
dividual, than he ever did at home.
Cayatte never indulges in experimen-
tation for its own sake, but his direction
is not static or conventional in the
narrow sense. The script, on which
Cayatte worked, has warm humanity and
ironic humor; the camerawork, never
unnecessarily tricksy, is mobile and
imaginative.
This is a vital, full-bodied film which
scores as entertainment while it eloquently
makes its moral point; that freedom is
an attitude of mind and spirit, not
merely the fact of not being in gaol.
A cast headed by Charles Aznavour,
Georges Riviere and Nicole Courcel
admirably translates Cayatte’s intentions
to the screen.
Set in a home for retarded children.
“A Child is Waiting” persuasively states
the case that children of this kind should
not be either rejected or cosseted, but
accepted for what they are. The starry-
eyed new worker at the home (an irritat-
ing, tremulous Judy Garland) at first
wants to insulate them from life by
love, but learns better by observing one
difficult child.
With the exception of the child actor
who plays the difficult patient, the in-
mates of the home are genuine cases of
retardation. The use of these children
could have been an offensive case of
moral blackmail, but the film makers have
treated them not with pity or indulgence
but with simple acceptance. After one’s
first shock at their undeveloped faces,
groping movements and hesitating
speech, one comes to recognise them as
human beings with the dignity of those
completely without pretension, who live
fully and (if given the chance) happily
within their own limits.
Technically, the film is capable but
undistinguished. Abby Mann's screen-
play is a tract (as might be expected)
but his lecture-room mannerisms are
mostly toned down by the direction and
by a beautifully straightforward and self-
effacing performance by Burt Lancaster
as the director of the institution.

Taming the Hurricane
When D. H. Lawrence went bush

rence and M. L. Skinner. Penguin.
7s. 6d.
bye, good luck,” Mollie Skinner
said, gazing fervently at the
departing Lawrence. “You have hit me
in the solar plexus.”
There was a little gasp from the Perth
ladies who had adopted the Lawrences,
not so much David as Frieda. She had
been a real Countess before marrying
the moody little man who gave a first
impression of being “something between
a reddish-bearded able-bodied seaman
and a handy man.”
This impression was dispelled when he
talked in a low, gentle voice of such
crimes as “outraging the solar plexus”,
which meant forcing yourself to do
something you didn't want to do.
Mollie Skinner explained that she
only meant that Mr Lawrence had
encouraged her to work on a manu-
script. Nurse Skinner was already an
author in the Westralian or Pickwickian
sense. She had published “Letters of a
VAD” under a nom de plume and a
tract on midwifery.
The Lawrences had felt rather
stranded in Perth. “We shall have to
wait a fortnight or so for a boat on to
Sydney,” he wrote glumly. They had
been whisked off to Jack Skinner's
farm in the Darlington Hills, 16 miles
from Perth, to stay as paying guests.
While Frieda purred on the verandah
to her feminine admirers, Lawrence was
supposed to stride off and commune with
the silent bush. Instead he went and
talked to Mollie Skinner, sitting on the
edge of the copper while she did the
washing.
“Mollie Skinner was a delightful
woman,” John Thompson told me. “A
woman of great character. She would
have been forty-seven when she met
Lawrence. She had a hare-lip and had
been a nurse all her working life. She
was very abrupt and down to earth
but a fine human being. Of course, she
worshipped Lawrence.”
Lawrence had charmed her, telling her
jeering stories of how he had “taken
round the hat” among his fellow authors
to pay for this trip; how Shaw had put
in a fiver and snubbed him; how Gals-
worthy had turned his back on him. “Be
spiteful,” Lawrence wrote to Mollie
Skinner once. “I always am.” But he was
never spiteful to Mollie Skinner. Now
that he could be a patron, helping a
fellow writer, he gave her more than
gold.
“You don’t know who to have for a
hero? There’s your brother Jack. You
say he came out here at sixteen to be a
jackaroo, and you followed him? Well,
he’s your hero.”
If Mollie Skinner had been hit in the
solar plexus by the impact of Lawrence,
Jack Skinner who stood for his portrait
as “Jack Grant”, must have felt as if he
had been given a similar blow when “The
Boy in the Bush” appeared. He had
knocked about all over the country, par-
ticularly on the goldfields, and was a
returned soldier, crippled by war wounds.
He rather avoided Lawrence who saw
him as a fellow rebel. “I believe that
was what ailed your brother,” Lawrence
wrote to Mollie, n August, 1925, after
Jack's death. “He couldn’t bear the
social fixity of everything. It's what ails
me too.”
1%/|ollie Skinner’s manuscript follow-
ed Lawrence like a questing grey-
hound. On September 2, 1923, when he
was in California, he made a generous
offer: —
Dear Miss Skinner,
l have read “The House of Ellis” care-
fully; such good stuff in it; but without
unity or harmony. I'm afraid as it stands
you'd never find a publisher. Yet I hate
to think of it all wasted. 1 like the
quality of so much of it. But you have
no constructive power. If you like, l will
take it and recast it. and make a book
of it. In which case we should have to
appear as collaborators or assume a
pseudonym. If you give me a free hand.
I'll see if I can’t make a complete book
out of it. If you’d rather your work
remain untouched, I will show it to
another publisher, but I am afraid there
isn’t much chance. You have a real gift
there is real quality in these scenes.
But without form like the world before
creation . . ”
Lawrence spent a whole fortnight re-
casting “The House of Ellis”. In
November, he wrote from New Mexico:
“I have been busy over your novel as I
travelled. The only thing was to write
it all out again, following your MS almost
exactly, but giving a unity, a rhythm,
and a little more psychic development. . .
The end will have to be different, a good
deal different.” On November 15, he
wrote, “I finished the novel yesterday—
I call it ‘The Boy in the Bush’. I think
quite a lot of it.”
The cynic may wonder whether it was
just a generous gesture on Lawrence’s
part, or whether Thomas Seltzer in New
York was pressing him for a book he
had not had the time to write. Lawrence
arranged that Molly Skinner should have
half the receipts. He was, he told her,
“anxious you may get some money as
well as fame.”
But when Mollie Skinner first saw
“The Boy in the Bush”, she “disapproved
passionately”. Lawrence’s solving the
hero's problem was like a hurricane
putting on stockings. Let him marry both
women. Why not? “After all, if a man
really has cared and cares for two women,
why should he suddenly shelve either
of them? It seems to me more immoral
to drop all connection with one of them
than to wish to have the two.”
“I was unhappy when the book arriv-
ed,” Mollie Skinner wrote later. “Every-
one I knew condemmed me in no uncer-
tain fashion for having a hand in it. One
of my aunts said; “I have burnt it leaf
by leaf—after I had read it.” This ap-
pealed to Mollie's sense of humor.
She booked herself a passage to Eng-
land, steerage, taking the manuscript of
another novel Lawrence had encouraged
her to write. “Let the theme be the con-
flict between the two kinds of love in the
heart of the girl.” On the voyage
a rich engineer was taken ill, and
Mollie found herself in a stateroom
nursing him. The engineer was sure her
new manuscript, Black Swans, would be
a success but he could not bear “The Boy
in the Bush”. When they landed, he
handed her an envelope which she found
contained her return fare.
Somehow, Mollie just missed Lawrence
everywhere. One feels he was evasive.
Reviews of "The Boy in the Bush" had
been favorable, and Mollie shyly paid
for press clippings. Edward Garnett was
kind to her and made her mark Law-
rence's part in “The Boy in the Bush”.
She claimed “three-fourths” of the
material.
In “The Boy in the Bush”, Mr
George, the Ellis farm, Gran, the
familiar preoccupation with family and
marriages, are certainly not Lawrence.
If Miss Skinner was naive, Law'rence had
an even more extraordinary naivete. It
is this mixture of improbabilities that
makes “The Boy in the Bush” rather
droll. Miss Skinner cannot be blamed
for the scene where Jack so eloquently
tries to persuade Mary, page after page,
that she ought to sleep with him. “Talk,
talk, talk, Jack hated a talking woman.
But Mary would rather sit gassing with
Old George than sleep with him, Jack,

Jack Grant-Lawrence, conquering Aus-
tralia, is always wholly successful as a
Paddy Hannan of the goldfields. He
finds gold because he is “a lord of the
dark halls of death”, and there is much
nonsense about the true-blue Englishman
putting the Colonials in their place,
riding the untamed stallion, a Lawrence
phantasy of himself as a pioneer making
a fortune. Jack Grant first espouses
Monica who has two illegitimate children,
then proposes to Mary, “queer, heavy
and dark, an old maid”, and plans to add
the deaf Miss Blessington as a third wife.
(Lawrence had just made the acquaint-
ance of “Brett”, the Honorable Dorothy
Brett who was deaf. He was later with
her in Europe.)
There are some fine pieces of Lawrence
mysticism in the book, a few Old Pro-
phet touches, and the “Halls of Death”
soliloquy which is haunting, a poet’s
fever dream. The London “Times” spoke
of the novel’s “raw pioneering atmos-
phere”, which is absurd. But the Skinner-
plus-Lawrence flavour is unique. It is
lemonade to which has been added
vitriol, medicinal alcohol and a mite of
bull-ant venom. Swallow it fast and it is
—memorable.
Architects
Georgian Architecture in Australia.
Photographs by Max Dupain. Com-
mentaries by Morton Herman,
Daniel Thomas and Marjorie Bar-
nard. Ure Smith. 755.
HThe survival of some Georgian archi-
tecture in Australia is of incalculable
value. It is most difficult for us to get
any solid sense of the past, in fact in
most parts of the country quite impos-
sible. Only in the earliest settlements
New South Wales and Tasmania
does any feeling for a quite different
age still linger. Our Georgian buildings
are reminders above all of the eighteenth
century. Even though most of them were
built in the nineteenth century, their
style belongs to the previous one, and
their authors were formed by the Age of
Reason. The nineteenth century seems
to belong to our own times, and respect
for it is confined to scholars with an
acute sense of time. The eighteenth
century turns back to the Renaissance.
This may simply be one of the hallucina-
tions of time, but it is an illusion which
architectural values at least give sub-
stance to.
Elegance is the most obvious quality of
Georgian architecture, and the most con-
spicuously absent one in all succeeding
styles, with a few polite Gothic excep-
tions. The Australian form of it, in the
hands of Greenway, John Lee Archer,
James Blackburn and John Verge, is

simpler than the original English but
it rarely sacrifices grace to convenience.
Moreover, to my eye Australian Georgian
buildings have this commanding superi-
ority over their successors that they stand
with dignity in the Australian landscape
just as well as they do in a city. Granted
that they seem more in harmony with
the civilised landscape of Tasmania and
perhaps rub shoulders more comfortably
with transplanted English lawns and trees,
than they do with the spare landscapes
of the mainland, but they never obtrude.
Mostly their architects used local mat-
erials with subdued good taste, and they
surely had a much more sensible esti-
mate of the exigencies of the local cli-
mate than the villa-mongers of today.
But above all they respected Classical
proportions and relied fundamentally on
open structure with little adornment.
Most changes made to them have there-
fore inevitably been mutilations.
Ure Smith’s “Georgian Architecture
in Australia” might have been better
under a more modest name. The back-
bone of the book (fairly cheap at 755.)
is the photography of Max Dupain. In
a hundred plates he gives an honest
and sensitive impression of a good selec-
tion of the best surviving examples of
the style. But the book is certainly not
the complete historical work the title
promises, and buyers should make up
their minds about it on the quality of
the photography. The commentaries are
brief and frankly sketchy. In his notes
Morton Herman warns that material on
the architects is conflicting, but in his
introduction he does give a very sound
and cool evaluation of the style, which
is the most important thing in a basically
illustrative work. The “social histories”
of New South Wales and Tasmania by
Marjorie Barnard and Daniel Thomas
serve little point. Drastically foreshort-
ened perspectives always distort, and I
personally find a statement like “History
is a creative art” rather unsettling. In-
formative guides can be a great help,
so long as they stay in the background
(which commonly they do not). Imagina-
tive ones are a real danger. In the long
run it is better to leave the visitor to
do his own romanticising over the tan-
gible history around him, and keep the
history to plain facts.
It is also puzzling, when presumably
space is precious and money short, to
find towards the back of the book some
Gothic Revival, like outhouses to the
Georgian, The reason is flimsy: Gothic
was the style the architects moved on to
after 1840, when, we are told, there
were “changes in Australian history, and
consequently in architecture.” One is
not sure whether to be bored or mys-
tified.
BILL HANNAN
M. H. Ellis adds:
One thing which the National Trust
has yet to learn is the need for care in
its statements of historical fact in the
contexts which it sponsors and approves.
The article by Miss Barnard, for instance,
teems with errors. To say that “of the
settlement Phillip founded no tangible
evidence remains except the Sirius’ an-
chor in Macquarie Place and a scatter-
ing of names” is not accurate. The shape
of Phillip’s Sydney still remains in the
lines of the streets and the situation of
Government areas, etc. (not to mention
the basis of park lands). It is wrong to
infer that Elizabeth Farm house is an
original building of 1793; not a vestige
of the old building has existed for 130
years or so. The description of a period
as “Macquarie, 1811-1829” is mysteri-
ous. Macquarie left the Colony in Feb-
ruary, 1822. To say that he was “driven
out” because he did not comply with
some Home Government instructions is
nonsense. He agreed to come for five
years. They refused to accept his resigna-
tion after seven. They accepted it with
reluctance, despite disagreements on
policy after ten. Macquarie's hospital
was not built by D’Arcy Wentworth,
Simeon Lord and Garnham Blaxcell.”
Lord, an ex-convict, was not associated
with the project. They did not build the
hospital in return for a “three-year
monopoly of the rum trade.” It was a
“monopoly” only of rum not already
ordered by private persons and excluded
also Government importations it rep-
resented a “monopoly” of perhaps a
quarter of the trade. Lieutenant Watts
was not wholly the architect of Govern-
ment House, Parramatta—Greenway had
a hand in it. Watts’ most important work,
the spires of St John’s, Parramatta, are
not mentioned. The inference that Kit-
chen originally designed St Matthew’s
Windsor, is incorrect: Greenway was the
architect and it was on his original plan
that Kitchen agreed to build. Commis-
sioner Bigge in decreeing that the pro-
posed law courts should be turned into
St James’ Church did not “veto a law
court as unnecessary.” He actually ap-
proved Greenway’s plan for another
court house parts of which still stand,
including Greenway’s last surviving and
lovely staircase—as the heart of the exist-
ing Supreme Court Building, soon to
be pulled down. These are samples.

The Disturbing Element. Xavier Her-
bert. Cheshire. 30s.
As the novel proper loses favor, other
** types of books, travel, biography
and autobiography, even popular science,
borrow its devices. Where Joyce led
many writers have followed, making the
judgment of autobiographical writing
even more difficult than in more straight-
forward times. We forgive almost any-
thing in a truly interesting autobiographer
terrible style, sloppiness of form,
conceit, introspection and egocentricity.
For one thing his readers possess enor-
mous power in the flesh they may
detest him and yet be unable to escape;
in book form he can be set aside and
returned to the library at will. The only
limitation on our power is that, pro-
vided we believe him to be honest, we
cannot question his major statements
about himself although we may question
his interpretations.
I am convinced of Xavier Herbert’s
honesty. He says early, “1 have been
reticent about publicising my beginnings
to date, not out of shame, else I should
not be confessing them now so recklessly,
but I believe, because I was waiting till
I felt qualified to make my revelations
in a way to discover for myself some-
thing of the reality of my existence.”
Herbert’s book is less like a novel
than some other recent life histories but
paradoxically more like than some of
his fiction which suggests autobiography.
It is an account of his childhood and
youth ending at the point in his early
twenties when he decided to make writ-
ing his profession. How long after this
H. G. Wells hailed him as a “Master
Writer” I do not know, and am puzzled
to understand quite what Wells meant
for, like Herbert’s novels, this tale is

Building up
Australia’s
industries
Australia’s economic well-being is
becoming increasingly dependent on
the sale of goods carrying the
“Australian made” label. Shell
gives its whole-hearted support to
the drive to build up Australia’s
industries by local buying whenever
possible. Last year Shell spent £3O
million on Australian made goods
and local services. This far reaching
investment benefits us all.
*For instance, local materials are
being used extensively in the new
multi-million pound lubricating oil
plant currently under construction
at Shell’s Geelong Refinery.
It’s got to be good to be Shell
told in rich, but often very clumsy lan-
guage. Perhaps Wells intended to say
“Born Writer,” for that Herbert un-
doubtedly is. What he lacks in style is
balanced by his marvellous ear for other
people’s speech, which he conveys in
dialogue with rare ability; by his eye
and memory, and by his idiosyncratic
sense of humor.
How much of himself Herbert even-
tually discovered in writing this book we
cannot know. I suspect that a good deal
of what his readers may find remains
hidden to the author. My interpretation
is that, sensing the “born writer’s” need
of an unhappy childhood, he has spared
no pains in the honest but misguided
manufacture of one. The truly unhappy
people were often, one imagines, his
helpless parents eccentric souls whose
tremendous potentialities as “characters”
are faithfully recorded, but barely real-
ised by their son.
A central irritant in the Herbert oyster
is his parents’ failure to legitimise his
birth. Those sections of his book in
which he dwells on his bastardy recalled
Neville Cardus’ opening chapter of his
autobiography to my mind. But Herbert,
I suspect, is less nonchalant about this
parental inconsequence than he admits
to himself. This is what rankles, there-
fore he must appear to jest and even
be proud of the one true hurt. Mean-
while, he invents other forms of parental
rejection as acceptable excuses for bitter-
ness, when on the evidence his parents
(allowing for their own natures, hopes
and lack of education) piovided a home
background that would have made Henry
Lawson green with envy. If they seldom
directly provided his opportunities for
advancement they certainly never stood
in his way and were as ambitious for him
as for their other children.
Herbert’s mother is the real central
character engaging one’s imagination be-
yond everyone else. Her own father (her
lifetime hero) .had left her to be brought
up by relatives. Widowed early in East-
ern Australia, and with two young child-
ren, she journeyed to the Western Aus-
tralian goldfields seeking her father.
Having found him she teamed up with
his younger partner, (Herbert’s father).
Despite what the son says about their
disunity the plain fact is that they re-
mained together (except for Herbert
senior’s war service) at least for the
duration of this account. They quarrelled
often but many vicissitudes and tem-
peramental differences failed to part
them. Mother sounds weird but amusing
with her zest for song and home pag-
eantry, her uneducated speech and be-
havior but her yearning for gentility as
she clings to a myth of aristrocratic fore-
bears. Herbert glosses over incidents
showing how people of higher social
station accepted her easily, when the
family moves to cities from the railway
towns where, due to father’s engine-
driving Xavier spent his early childhood.
Her four surviving children entered
middle-class professions and mixed with
middle-class people without difficulty.
Mother liked to wear men’s hats, it
seems, but she also wanted to live “like
a lady” and did so at the end.
Mother was also immensely tolerant
most boys as randy as young Xavier
would thank their stars for so com-
plaisant a Mum. Indeed readers must
decide for themselves whether to accept
Herbert’s tales of early sexual experi-
ments on the author's terms or according
to their own, perhaps more compassion-
ate, interpretations.
As a whole “The Disturbing Element”
(Father’s term for his son) is an im-
mensely entertaining book. Herbert’s
peculiar marriage of true cynicism with
naive gusto is unique whether it colors
tales of childhood dealings with horses,
relatives and teachers; or with his studies
for and adventures in the profession of
pharmacy where he lived up to the
belief of an early mentor that “The
Chemist is a girl’s best friend.”

The Ship and Ither Poems. Tom
Scott. 295. 9d. Modern Malay
Verse. Oxford.
/Tharles Tomlinson’s is a flexible, in-
formal verse, not based on a varied
drive of rhythmic stress but picking its
way carefully by ear from phrase to
phrase, often fragmentary, rising occas-
ionally to a full swelling line, rhyming
haphazardly and commonly not at the
line endings. He shows often, but far
from always (for the hazards are insuper-
able) a great delicacy and precision in the
broken, fleeting movement of his lan-
guage; and if it lacks certainty, that is to
the point.
This is also my first real acquaintance
w'ith Anthony Thwaite, whose poetry I
find more immediately to my taste. The
apparent ease with which he can render
every-day incidents into certain poetry
is enviable seeing an Asiatic in a
bar, meeting an out-of-work serving
woman on a train, going to church on
Sunday morning: all these things find
their place in his work, and yet it is not
the flip, throwaway poetry of a Kingsley
Amis, but a gravely reflective poetry that
moves unobtrusively as near to the grand
manner as in these lines:
Five senses know their tiny impotence.
And sensual man wounded in every
sense.
It is an article of faith for most people
that modern poetry has lost its audience
by its own silly, over-clever fault: few
poets’ work could stand better in refuta-
tion of this than Thwaite’s, but who is
going to buy a book of verse called “The
Owl in the Tree” (one poem makes clear
sense of this title) at 295. 9d.? The work
is neither coy nor too cosy and will pass
the most austerely “literary” reader, yet
remains entirely accessible to any ordin-
ary intelligent man who has no mental
blockage against verse; I read it at a
gallop with sustained enjoyment. Perhaps
it remains to be said, though, that it is
definitively minor poetry: as things stand
I would rather read Thwaite than Tom-
linson, but Tomlinson has the world
before him, while Thwaite looks like
staying worthily in the suburbs.
Tom Scott raises some interesting
hypothetical questions, but too little else.
There are a lot of English-speaking
peoples with different accents; and how
might a poet set about registering the
individuality of the way the language
sounds where he is? Mainly we don’t
worry, and it seems to do little harm.
But the Scots are in a special case, be-
cause they have in their historical past
an off-English language which still sug-
gests the peculiarities of the way they
go about talking: hence, a number of
modern Scots poets have taken to writ-
ing in the sort of largely factitious dia-
lect used by Scott in “The Ship and Ither
Poems”. The strain tells: very often
Scott lapses into very thinly-disguised
(and usually very thin) standard English,
while at other times the poetic achieve-
ment seems simply to consist in employ-
ing a welter of dialect words. This is
most obvious in the several poems which
are “eftir” French poets (Baudelaire and
Villon): the incipient crassness of the
procedure is nowhere more evident than
in the rendering of Villon’s most famous
line as:
Ay, whaur are the snaws o langsyne?
Here, as elsewhere, the enthusiasm for
Scots-ness seems to override even a
poem's rhythm. If it remains true that
Scott shows signs of real talent, it re-
mains more powerfully true that the
marginal glosses do not save the poetry
from being, over-all, unreadable to the
non-aficionado (or whatever the Lallans
for that would be).
James Kirkup tells us in his intro-
duction to a selection of six Malaysian
poets that they are starting from scratch:
the only folk-poetry antecedent has
been discarded. Kirkup also says that
without understanding the Malay
(which is printed face-to-face with English
translations) we can “hear” it. This is
hardly so, as we have no guide to
accent, but it looks an uncommonly
chiming language in which sound-pat-
terns can be reproduced at will. In trans-
lation, none of the poets reads very
well: there is a range from virtual Com-
munist propaganda verse, with its heart
but little else in the right place, to what
I might call “emotional impressionism”
whose heart is pretty well unlocated;
there is too little in between. If I could
hazard a guess on the basis of these
translations, I should say that Masuri
SN is easily the pick of the lot. Will we
ever know?

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
It’s so Good it May Hurt
Australian sharemarkets did some soul-searching in
October at a time when business and economic statistics,
on the surface, appeared to be as buoyant as any time
since 1960. Perhaps the thought of the 1960 boom, and the
consequent restrictive measures of the Federal Government,
reminded many that restraints can be re-applied. Certainly,
with high liquidity in the economy and £757m. of unexercised
overdraft limits, there is plenty of fuel for inflation.
Plans for a snap election on November 30 could not be
made at a better time, with official unemployment figures
down to 59,000 the lowest
September level of unemploy-
men since 1960. Recorded
figures could fall still further,
but actual unemployment must
rise sharply when school-leav-
ers come on the market early
next year, whether they register
for unemployment or not. So
today’s unemployment statis-
tics could be almost as good as
they will get.
Coinciding with this favor-
able level of employment, new
lending commitments by the
trading banks continued at a
high rate of more than £ll mil-
lion a week in early September.
But borrowers have not been
using their bank loans as much
as expected, because advances of
the major trading banks drop-
ped in September by £15.8m.
to £1,087.8 m. a very steep
September fall when compared
with a drop of £5.6m. in Sep-
tember, 1962.
Business people, expecting a
possible tightening up early next
year, have arranged bank over-
draft accommodation in advance.
For the moment, they have
been unable (or unwilling) to
use the credit placed at their
disposal. Public expenditure
is rising, to be sure, on items
like motor vehicles, yet manu-
facturers must plan forward into 1964 when they will be
faced with a round of wage increase demands, including the
triennial Federal basic wage decision in February.
Meanwhile competition is keen in consumer durables, import
restrictions are relaxed further under the new Japan-Australia
Trade Agreement, and price cutting in food and grocery lines
has extended to cigarettes. It is certainly a buyer’s market.
If unemployment figures are dropping sharply, employers
will want to see a close analysis of such figures to determine
if absorption of employment is being achieved in vital indus-
Share Capital of Trading Banks
The above graph shows the sare capitals of the private
trading banks after the recent round of issues and reorganisa-
tions, together with the equity invested in hire-purchase
affiliates. The banks’ ruling dividend rates are: Adelaide 10
p.c.; NSW, 10 p.c.; Commercial of Australia, 10 p.c.; Com-
mercial of Sydney, 9½ p.c.; National, 9½ p.c.; ANZ, 12 p.c.;
ESA, 9 p.c.
tries, or whether Government payrolls are continuing to take
up a large proportion of the slack.
Digesting these figures and turning to the ANZ Bank’s
Index of Industrial Production, it is a little disconcerting to
note that the index, seasonally adjusted, did not move off the
168 mark in the months from March to July. The economic
recovery has gathered pace since then, according to various
production reports since July, but the real unknown is: How
much local consumption is being generated? And, regardless of
whether or not it is generating strongly enough, is Australia
capturing those export markets
so vital to its expansion?
Most of the good company
results for 1962-63 have been
published. The laggards now
blushingly appearing on the
stage are stammering with
excuses, if not admitting sharp
losses like Cox Brothers, the
Melbourne-based credit retailer
which, on a group turnover of
£32m., reported a trading loss
of £175,000 the first in its
history.
Buoyant company profits, as
well as poor results, are now
only a matter of history. The
news of importance awaited
by the sharemarket and the
economy is how companies fared
in the six months to December,
which qsually is the most
buoyant part of their finan-
cial year and frequently sets
the profit pattern for the full
year.
The sharemarket took a lot
of these factors into account
when pushing prices to an all-
time high on September 8.
Having established this peak of
recognition, investors then
stood back and wondered if
their enthusiasm would be jus-
tified by results for 1963-64.
Federal policy - makers also
contemplated the situation and,
after analysing the favorable line-up of statistics and other
factors (including the breach in the Labor camp over State
aid to denominational schools), decided to go to the polls.
If restraints are necessary next year, the flexible interest
rate policy of the Reserve Bank could play a vital role in
controlling credit and so absolve the Federal Government of
the need to introduce unpopular legislation. But an election
would still have to be faced at the end of the year. By contrast,
today’s favorable climate is more appropriate for asking the
public for a mandate.


There’s Gold Among
That Thar Wheat
/Capitalism triumphed over ideology in America when Presi-
dent Kennedy finally announced that some of America’s
embarrassing wheat surplus would be sold to the Soviet.
After all, with Canada (6.8 m. tons), Australia (I.Bm. tons)
and others getting into the act, America was losing valuable
sales.
It is comforting, nevertheless, to the Americans to know
that the much vaunted Soviet agricultural system is bogged
down with bad weather, crop failures and bad management.
The wheat shortages in China and Russia could not have come
at a better time, because Russia is coughing up with large
quantities of gold to pay for her wheat purchases . . . and
gold is something which Uncle Sam needs at the moment to
bolster falling reserves.
The emergence of USA as a seller of wheat on the lucrative
Russian market has long-term implications for nations like
Australia, which have gained windfall sales. There is no guar-
antee that Russian and Chinese purchases will continue at
the current rate, even if the Communists could afford to keep
buying. And, if America approaches the position in a business-
like way, there is no doubt she has plenty of wheat to meet
existing demands.
Therefore, those who are rushing to plant more wheat may
discover that Communist markets are hardly permanent
markets.
At the same time, statisticians (with what figures they can
obtain) are calculating that the Soviet grain harvest is running
nearly 50 million tons below its planned target of 180 million
tons set for 1965. The same target was set for 1960, but total
grain production for that year was only 134 million tons, of
which 64 million tons was wheat. Production has risen slowly
to 147 million tons in 1962, of which 70 million tons was
wheat, but the rising standards of living, plus an increasing
population, have placed a severe strain on available supplies.
Russia recently purchased about 10 million tons and prob-
ably would like to repeat the purchase. Not only is Russia
finding that its livestock population requires more grain fodder,
but its satellite dependants (including Cuba) are asking for
sustenance.
The seriousness of the situation is emphasised by the fact
that both China and the Soviet were forced to bid on the
open market in competition with each other.
Despite Russia’s reclamation of vast lands in Siberia and
Kazakhstan since 1954, the vagaries of weather in these areas
have had a restrictive influence on grain yields. Critics now
claim that Russia failed in the one area where America shines
. . . intensive farming. Mr Khrushchev himself has been quoted
only last month as stressing the virtues of American produc-
tivity and urging greater use of irrigation and fertiliser.
Perhaps the wheat shortages in the Soviet may not be as
low as indicated by the queues of comrades who have been
lining up outside bread shops. The Soviet obviously must keep
something in reserve for strategic stockpiling. But there is no
doubt that production must be well below expectations if
Russia is forced to dip so heavily into its gold stocks. The
Soviet was reported in September to have sold 250 million
dollars worth of gold in Europe, or roughly 40 million more
than it sold for the whole of 1962.
The Russians bought 500 million dollars worth of grain from
Canada, some of it financed on 18 months’ credit. As a result,
the Canadian dollar took a healthy uplift and speculators in
the gold market scurried for cover when they saw such huge
amounts of Russian gold come onto the market.
Russian sales of gold so far for 1963 have been estimated
at 325 million dollars, equivalent to the total net flow into
official reserves for 1962. With more wheat purchases in
prospect, financed partly by further gold sales, hoarders of
gold are feeling a little sick about their forecasts of an increase
in the price of gold.
World Liquidity Takes
the Spotlight
VI/'hatever else was achieved at the just-concluded annual
" meeting of the International Monetary Fund, there at
least came to the surface a definite desire to tackle the prob-
lems of world liquidity along fairly co-operative lines. The
present attitudes of the Fund’s major members stand rather
in contrast to their previous year's positions, when a good
deal of hedging occurred on the need for adjusting the inter-
national financial system.
Even this year some doubts were given credence that the
liquidity question would not receive radical attention, for the
Fund’s own published report in September conservatively
declared: ‘‘Most countries already have sufficient reserves or
access to credit arrangements, particularly in the Fund, to
finance the kind of balance of payments disequilibria that
might occur.”
Yet a climax to all possible discussions remained the
critical overall American trade deficit and the future state of
the dollar in its role as a key currency. The United States
itself had already made urgent protective moves.
Added to these is now to be an examination of the entire
world monetary structure by the IMF and a further study
group into international liquidity set up by the so-called
Paris Club of 10 principal industrial nations. They comprise
Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Nether-
lands, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States.
The study group’s collection of Deputy Finance Ministers
will be chaired by the redoubtable Mr Robert Roosa of
the US Treasury, whose moderate conversion to the cause
of wider international linkings somewhat reverses his decisive
1962 view to avoid genuine world planning.
After preliminary talks in Washington the group decided
to hold its first formal Paris meeting early in November and
thence come together every six weeks or so. Close association
with the IMF takes place through the Fund’s managing
director, M. Pierre - Paul Schweitzer, though the deputies
apparently face a few tactical battles before really getting
down to work.
Most of the study group’s European members are of course
large holders of surplus dollars. The concerns of debtor-
creditor countries are thus likely to provide their main pre-
occupation for a while.
It seems impossible, however, to dodge the total volume of
world liquidity for very long and the IMF, a probable vehicle
for any changes, must also be interested in pulling discus-
sions towards that line.
The Americans still stay firmly pat on no change in the
price of gold, believing that the “underlying structure of the
monetary system based on fixed exchange rates and the
established price of gold has proven its value as the founda-
tion for present and future arrangements.”
Such rigidity, if maintained, precludes any startling innova-
tions in world monetary behavior. The will to improve existing
practices is perhaps the best outcome of the Washington get-
together.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Accounting in a Changing World
Helping management’s ability to make decisions
industry in general and also for
individual firms, adjustment to eco-
nomic change is essential to survival, but
is industrial management in Australia
getting the right sort of information from
its accountants to produce the right
decisions in making adjustment to
change?
In the opinion of Mr W. C. Cus-
worth of the Gas and Fuel Corporation
of Victoria, expressed in Melbourne last
week in his paper to the second annual
convention of the Australian Gas Asso-
ciation, in the light of the rapidly chang-
ing production and demand patterns, in
his own industry there is too high a re-
liance on historical costs in making
managerial decisions and the same ob-
servation is probably valid for a wide
range of other Australian industries.
As for the strength of economic
change itself, Mr Cusworth doubted
whether the supply section of the gas
industry has ever experienced as rapid
a rate of technological change as now.
Sources and prices of raw materials are
changing; the availability of substitute
gases from other industries is widening.
Changes in manufacturing technology
are making tremendous demands on
management, on its competence, its
vision, its economic knowledge and skill,
its ability to make rapid decisions, its
flexibility in short, its ability to
manage.
It is the same on the demand side.
Traditional gas markets are disappearing
and new markets are offering themselves.
Once the gas industry’s principal market
was in the lighting field. This was lost
to electricity and cooking became the
main market. Water heating has in re-
cent years started to take over from
cooking and who knows what will be
“best seller” in the next few years
space heating? Air conditioning?
Among the broader changes taking
place amongst the diverse forces which
influence the conduct of the gas industry,
some are obvious, others more subtle.
Population is changing, in age distribu-
tion and, due to immigration, in out-
look, habits and customs; cities are
changing in dimensions, layout and de-
sign; living standards are changing; all
having a profound influence on the short
and long-range economics of the gas
business.
It is obvious, says Cusworth, that as a
result of the increasing tempo of change
management problems have become more
complex. The information and facts cur-
rently at the disposal of management
have become increasingly inadequate to
assist them in coping with these problems.
“The information and costs needed to
appraise the progress of a company
throughout the financial year and to
measure executive performance are dif-
ferent costs to those needed in decisions
involving two alternative courses of ac-
tion. However, in the past, management
has been inclined to accept the informa-
tion in these routine control reports as
cure-alls for all financial ‘ills’. Unsub-
stantiated guesses could produce more
accurate results than the use of cost
information used for purposes other than
those for which it was produced.”
Invariably, he states, cost reporting
and information systems report historical
costs and data. “This is probably so be-
cause traditionally financial reporting
was influenced by the custodian role of
the accountant; by the need to account
for the disposition of funds of the com-
pany, and of the need for verifiable in-
formation to enable it to fulfil this func-
tion. This historical information pro-
duces, in the words of loel Dean, ‘an
impeccable pecuniary history admirably
suited to the legal and financial purposes
for which it was designed.’ It is still
important for a number of reasons and it
is not necessarily incorrect to produce
historical costs for control purposes. In
any control system, financial or other-
wise, particularly where feedback is
present, it is still historical in nature.
some degree, the use of average
-*• costs is dictated by the cost of
obtaining broad economic indicators.
However, we are deluding ourselves
if we use these unit costs in de-
cisions which are going to affect
us in the future. Average unit costs
are the result of a varying number
of factors they are the compounded
result of various levels of activity, of
various input factors such as raw mat-
erial prices, and of various efficient and
inefficient performances.
“In some cases, they only reflect a
mathematical mean of a number of unlike
processes. They can be the result of
low costs at the beginning of a period
and high costs at the end of the period.
In other words, they can indicate the
mid-zone of an increasing trend in costs.
They rarely indicate, however, what will
be the costs in the coming year, unless
they are analysed with a great deal of
care.
“If your decision is whether or not
to produce more coke in the coming
year, the prices and costs which appear
in your current reports are, perhaps, of
little importance. What are more per-
tinent are the prices and the cost that
you are going to incur in the coming
year by any decisions which you are
about to make. The fact that future
costs require some form of estimation
if you like, guesswork and be-
cause these are uncertain does not detract
from the need to use these estimates
in preference to current 01 historical
costs.”
If average costs are not the correct
costs to use in making decisions during
a period of change, what are the appro-
priate costs? Mr Cusworth says that
when asked to prepare his paper, he
was specifically asked to stress the need
for a proper understanding of the use of
incremental costs in decisions relating
to change, but after some thought he
thinks incremental costs are not the only
costs to be considered in decision making
under these conditions.
But he says in most decisions relating
to change, the most applicable concept
is incremental costs, though in the past
this concept has been surrounded with
suspicion because more often incre-
mental costs are estimated or forecast.
However, Cusworth thinks that “in
decisions relating to the future there is
probably a greater danger in using so-
called ‘actual costs’ relating to past
events than in using forecast costs.”
On the other hand, although according
to Cusworth the concept of incremental
costs is easy to understand, its applica-
tion is more difficult (and this may be
a further reason for its disfavor in the
past). Perhaps one of the most difficult
questions to be answered in relation to
incremental costs is whether incremental
in the long run should be included as
well as those incremental in the short run.
“It is impossible to give a general
formula, or rule, to indicate what are
the appropriate incremental costs. The
circumstances involved will, in the main,
influence the choice. A sound back-
ground of facts, both in load and cost
characteristics, plus tons of common-
sense, are the other main ingredients.”
There is a pressing need in the gas
industry, he says, for a proper research
approach to the field of economics with-
in the industry, particularly into those
factors which influence costs wherever
there is change. “We should have a thor-
ough knowledge of our customer charac-
teristics by type, and the effect that
these characteristics have on our costs.
We should be able to identify any change
in these characteristics as soon as it
occurs, and to predict the effect of this
change also on costs.”
The same can be said for industry in
general.


Downward Trend Of Interest
Should Continue
A Bull Point for Investment
By ROGER RANDERSON
Among the uncertainties that are re-
fleeted in the recent shake-out on
the Stock Exchange is premature talk
about possible official action to reverse
the present downward tendency of rates
of interest for borrowing and lending
money.
Because the purchasing-power of
money is now relatively steady, interest
rates should come down.
They should be much lower than the
emergency levels to which they were
raised in 1960-61.
And they should be lower than they
were during the inflationary boom of
1959 and 1960, when the currency was
depreciating at an annual rate of 3 to
4 p.c.
It is true that the Commonwealth
Government was able to raise the July
loan, which was heavily over-subscribed,
at a redemption yield of £4/11/1 p.c.
per annum for the 1986 maturity.
This compares with £5/7/6 p.c. per
annum during the period of adjustment
in 1961 and rates of about 5 p.c. per
annum during the boom.
Allowance must be made, however, for
the fact that the price level (as measured
by movements in the consumer price
index between June quarters) actually
fell by 0.8 p.c. in 1961-62 and increased
by only 0.7 p.c. in 1962-63.
The real or effective bond rate is at a
high and attractive level, especially when
tax rebates on interest are considered.
Life offices, for example, require 2 p.c.
more than bond rate to secure an equiva-
lent return from a fully taxed security.
Similarly, semi-governmental authori-
ties and municipalities are securing all
their increased loan requirements on and
off the market at lower nominal rates
than in past years.
With the aid of the compulsory 30/20
investment ratio, all the budgeted funds
required by the so-called public sector
are likely to be provided in 1963-64.
Surely, if this had been foreseen, the
Treasury would have recommended that
the depressive sixpence in the £ added
to the company tax rate in 1960 be re-
moved to stimulate the economy in the
quarters where it is most needed.
Private borrowing rates are gradually
coming down, and the movement could
go a good deal further.
Hire-purchase companies, who are
still the chief borrowers in the depressed
private loan market, are offering 10s.
to £ 1 p.c. less than before.
One of the best indicators of free in-
terest rates is recorded by the NSW
Statistician. It is the weighted average
rate on first mortgages registered, where
mortgages are persons and corporations
other than a bank or building society.
This average mortgage rate moved
steadily up from 7.3 p.c. in 1957-58 to
its peak of 9.1 p.c. in December, 1962.
By July of this year this average rate
had already fallen to 8.6 p.c.
No one can doubt that it can and
should fall a good deal further. Among
the influences in this direction is official
action taken at the time of the Budget
to permit the savings banks to invest
a larger proportion of their funds in
financing the purchase of homes.
Bank interest rates are still subject to
discriminatory controls.
is not the slightest doubt in my
mind that if these bank interest con-
trols were lifted, private borrowing rates
in general would fall further, even
though higher overdraft rates would be
charged for the riskier or less nationally
desirable advances.
Nevertheless, the present maximum
overdraft rate of 6i p.c. is a good deal
higher today, with the price level rising
at not more than one p.c. a year, than
was the rate of 6 p.c. in 1959 and 1960,
when the price level was rising at 3 to
4 p.c. a year.
Savings banks are offering a much
greater incentive to thrift with the same
3 p.c. rate for virtually call money than
they were in 1959 and 1960.
This is the key to any practicable
changes in fixed deposit rates. Subject
to this 1 can only regard the 3+ p.c. now
being offered for 12 months’ fixed de-
posits as excessive compared with the
rates of 21 p.c. the banks offered in
1959 and 1960.
Transitionary periods always raise
some elements of uncertainty, and this
is true concerning the present downward
tendency in interest rates.
Many of the less satisfactory company
results, which are unduly depressing
Stock Exchange sentiment considering
some of the splendid results that are
also coming to hand, are due to a high
gearing of borrowed funds raised at the
relatively high rates of the past.
Inflationary capital gains, but not
normal capital enhancement from rising
earnings of efficiency, are ruled out by
price stability.
The companies that are showing the
best results at present are those which
can finance their expansion to a large
extent from earnings, or raise capital
on attractive terms from their share-
holders.
It is obvious that in the new situation
a high ratio of borrowed funds to capi-
tal may be a positive disadvantage until
interest and other borrowing expenses
are adjusted down to current market
levels.
Even a great company like BHP must
now be regretting that it put out long-
term debentures at 7 p.c. in 1962, when
their present premium price shows that
the money might now be raised for about
30s. p.c. less.
Nevertheless, the continued falling ten-
dency of interest rates is one of the
most promising aspects of the invest-
ment scene.
It offers the assurance that plans for
business expansion and constructional ac-
tivity will continue to accelerate.
And it promises renewed interest in
equity investment on the Stock Ex-
change in the early future, especially if
greater regard is paid to “earnings yield,”
which is more relevant than “dividend
yield” in comparison with fixed interest
rates.
Those officials and private persons
who are unwisely canvassing an early
rise in interest rates may need to be
reminded of the words of the English
master of economics written long ago.
“The causes of alternating periods of
inflation and depression of commercial
activity,” according to the great Mar-
shall, “are intimately connected with
those variations in the real rate of in-
terest which are caused by changes in
the purchasing power of money.”
Far-sighted Group
U'xports to 25 countries in the Far
East, North America, Europe and
Africa, representing one-fifth of total
production, is the special pride of
Martin Wells Holdings. The company,
Australia’s largest maker of ophthalmic
spectacle frames, is headquartered at St
Mary’s, NSW.
It is being readied for Sydney listing
with a placement of 250,000 ss. ordinary
shares at 7s. 6d. Total paid capital will
be £250,000 in ordinary shares, and
£40,000 in preference shares which
have the unusual feature of being con-
vertible.
Last earning rate of 20.8 p.c. and
forecast dividend of 10 p.c. would
show an earnings yield on placement
price of 11.2 p.c. and an income return
of 6.7 p.c.


“CROESUS”
Opening Company Oysters
Nobody entitled to exclusive information
on the question of what
information should be disclosed in
the accounts of Australian public com-
panies has mostly been angled on the
needs of investment analysis and the
rights and protection of shareholders on
the one hand and the consequences for
the competitive position of companies
on the other. Company legislation has
attempted to strike a satisfactory balance
between these considerations, perhaps
without very much thought of the wider
aims of fostering competition in the
economy.
The result has been that companies
anxious to deny competitors too close
a sight of their situations have had to
draw back the curtain on their affairs
further than they would prefer and much
further than they have been accustomed
to but still not far enough to satisfy the
demands of investors trying to assess
the real value of their shareholdings and
ensure the sound disposition of their in-
vestments.
From the frequent protests of investors
that companies have failed to provide
sufficient information it has seemed,
however illogically, there was a conflict
of interests between a company itself
and its shareholders, as if the two were
not one and the same thing.
In their desire for fullei disclosure
by companies, investors run the danger
of acting against their own interests in
that they could put competitors of their
companies at an unnecessary advantage.
Their enthusiasm for more information
could be misguided, though not of course
from the viewpoint of the new cham-
pions of the competitive society like, say,
Sir Garfield Barwick.
HThese are the third men, so to speak,
in this debate. They haven’t made
their presence felt in the argument here
as yet on the question of how much in-
formation should be disclosed by com-
panies in the interest of encouraging
more competition in the economy, but
they have been having a good dry run
on the parallel course of the restrictive
practices proposals for the best part of
a year now. Overseas their voice has
already been raised in protest against the
paucity of information provided by com-
panies.
One of them appears to have gone
well over the odds in Britain recently.
Looking at the disclosure of company
information from the angle of the econ-
omy as a whole, Mr Harold Rose,
Reader in Business Finance at the Uni-
versity of London, has made a series of
recommendations which would virtually
take the whole lid of secrecy from the
finances of public and private companies
alike.
Behind his recommendation lies a con-
viction that the pressure of competition
provides the only workable and con-
tinuous solution to the conflict of econ-
omic interest and that the accountability
of management to shareholders is an
essential ingredient of a competitive
economic system.
The interest of society as a whole, he
says, requires broader criteria than the
interests of a particular firm. “If capital
is to be directed to the points of highest
profitability the result is bound to be
that firms previously in the most favored
position find that others move into their
rich pastures. Indeed it is one of the
fundamental objects of the market
mechanism to do just that.”
T>ose admits that the logical conclusion
of this line of thinking is that nobody
is entitled to exclusive information in
industry even if millions have been spent
in research and development in pro-
ducing a new drug or a revolutionary
piece of machinery. But he thinks the
interest of society would not be served
by allowing even the “pioneer” type of
monopoly position to deteriorate into the
complacency that results when it is im-
mune to the threat of effective competi-
tion.
Even if Rose obviously has his feet
very far from the hard ground of the
business world, nonetheless it may be
useful to outline his recommendations
on the disclosure of information by
companies.
To start with Rose wants all com-
panies to publish half-yearly accounts
and turnover figures with details for
each product handled. While nobody
here as far as I know has ever suggested
turnovers should be disclosed in such
detail as that in Australia for one
thing the work involved for company
secretaries would be enormous many
have pressed for overall turnover figures
(though not for private companies, of
course). Many, including The Bulletin,
have argued the case for more frequent
reporting of results, some to the extent
of wanting quarterly reports as in the
United States.
Rose says sales should be subdivided
according to the categories used in the
Standard Industrial Classification and the
Census of Distribution, where appro-
priate. (These would be the equivalent,
say, of the Commonwealth Statistician’s
industrial classifications and the Com-
monwealth census in Australia.)
Profit and loss accounts should in-
corporate a standard operating account,
the main categories of which should be
defined as in the census of production,
where appropriate, says Rose.
notes to the balance sheet should
-*• include a statement of fire insurance
values for each class of fixed asset, to-
gether with separate figures of book
value for the assets insured. One might
have thought, however, that the inclusion
of the fire insurance value of assets
would mislead more investors than it in-
formed, for the insurance value is not
necessarily a reflection of present worth.
The only possibility of obtaining that
sum would be a fire and even then the
figure could be very different from the
cost of replacing an old factory with a
new one with modern machinery.
Further, Rose thinks companies should
disclose separately their purchases and
sales of fixed assets in each class, to-
gether with accumulated depreciation
and book values in the case of sales.
Again, figures for stocks should be
subdivided into raw materials and fuel,
work in progress and finished goods.
Payments received in advance or pay-
ments for work in progress should be
stated separately.
Also, the directors’ report should dis-
close any material interest by directors
in contracts entered into by their com-
pany in cases where directors together
own more than 50 p.c. of the issued
capital, or where a company solicits
deposits from the public.
Life assurance olfices should be re-
quired to publish every five years a
valuation of assets at market value and
of liabilities calculated at a rate of in-
terest appropriate to asset yield.
Banks should not be exempted from
the provisions of the Companies Act re-
lating to secret reserves. A system of
deposit insurance should be applied to
the banks.
Commenting on his suggestions (“Dis-
closure in Company Accounts”), the In-
stitute of Economic Affairs, which pub-
lished them, says that insufficient atten-
tion has been given to the practical prob-
lems of the scope, limitations and costs
of business information and that econ-
omic analysis still tends to start from
the unreal assumption of perfect know-
ledge. The Institute's aim is to examine
ways of improving the quality and quan-
tity of information to advance the per-
formance of a competitive economy.


Mr. HILLER and his craft
THE IMPORTANCE OF A NAME
It’s important to realise that there is such a person as Mr. Ernest
Hiller the label that goes on to his suits is not a “brand name”
but his own personal signature.
It’s a guarantee that the suit has been tailored to Mr. Hiller's
demanding standards (hand detailed where only handwork will do);
that the pure wool worsteds are of a superb quality.
The international styling of an Ernest Hiller suit is undisputed
as is the value-for-money that goes with every suit that carries
his name.

INVESTMENT SECTION
Crisis in Cox Brothers
HThe Stock Exchange deserves a pat on
the nose for sensing for the last
year or so that something was amiss with
Cox Bros., but as so often happens its
fears have been the more obvious and
unfounded ones. Lacking a seeing-eye
on the intricate trading workings in this
case, it could not have been expected
necessarily to have put its finger on the
root cause of the company’s troubles,
which have culminated in the lowering
of the dividend flag to half-mast by pas-
sing the final payment for the year to
July 31 last.
The most canvassed source of diffi-
culty during the last year has of course
been stretched liquidity. This has long
been the company’s sore spot. Its huge
borrowings in relation to issued capital
have rightly been compared to those of
Reid Murray and many a vulture has
been predicting that •it too would be
touched by the same cruel hand of fate
default on a repayment or an interest
commitment and suffer the ignominy of
a receivership.
On a number of occasions during the
last year rumors have reached The Bul-
letin as well as the Stock Exchange
that the fatal day was at hand for the
company on the liquidity front. Attack-
ing as the best means of defence, how-
ever, the company even resorted to news-
paper advertisements to show it was in
the position to buy bulk quantities of
merchandise for cash and made great
play of its buying of the entire £ 1 mil-
lion stock of Sargood Gardiner on such
terms.
So it was understandable that in hav-
ing to reveal a loss of £.118,355 (in-
creased to about £175,000 when sums
due to outside interest are counted in)
for 1962-63 compared with the previous
year’s profit of £685,406, Sir Frank
Richardson, the 62-year-old Bendigo-
born chairman, should at once pro-
claim that the group was up to date with
its obligations to its far-ranging trade
and other creditors and was in fact still
getting the maximum trade discounts on
all its purchases.
Nonetheless the Stock Exchange has
not been so far off the track as might
be supposed. For although Sir Frank
is at pains to nail the main source of
loss to Sydney Snow Pty Ltd which the
group acquired ten years ago, in fact the
£289,512 loss attributed to Snows was
considerably less than the increase of
£316,721 to the mammoth total of
£1,740,095 in the group’s interest bill
for the year.
Clearly the price of staying liquid has
been exceptionally high. Working on
about the same turnover of around £32
million the group has obviously had to
use a very much higher amount of
working capital. How much more the
group accounts will not necessarily show,
as they will give the picture only as at
July 31 and not as a serial over the
whole of the year.
While the cash flows in the group’s
trading accounts could have been
roughly the same as in the previous year,
the preliminary statement makes it plain
that profit margins have been squeezed
close to extinction, that is to i p.c. com-
pared with 2.1 p.c. in the previous year
from profitable activities, so that very
little, if anything taking the group as a
whole, has been furnished net for work-
ing capital requirements from trading
activities.
The group says it is taking vigorous
steps to stop the leaks in the worst vessel
of the fleet, but it will have to lift the
profit line in the others if it is to hold the
confidence of its creditors and backers.
Investors are no longer under any il-
lusion.
Considering All Factors
TTope lives eternal, but before getting
too excited at the offer of sale for
Factors’ two main assets, the Holeproof
companies, shareholders of the company
should turn again to the views on the
prospects for a return of capital ex-
pressed by the receivers late in July
when making their statement of the com-
pany’s affairs as at April 2 this year.
The estimates presented then indi-
cated that while debenture-holders
(£3,500,000) would get all their money
back, noteholders (£1,250,000) and
other creditors would receive only 15s.

in the £. Nothing would be left over
for shareholders.
The receiver at that time, Mr K. H.
Vial for the Bank of New Zealand, who
on the liquidation of Factors’ debt of
£564,977 to it has handed over to
Mr C. G. Landy for the debenture-
holders, said that after a thorough in-
spection he estimated that “on final
realisation of the company’s affairs
there could be a total deficit of between
£lOO,OOO and £350,000.” He added
the rider that when the offers for the
Holeproof companies are in “it will
then be possible to calculate with greater
accuracy the funds likely to become
available to meet the company’s obliga-
tions to its creditors.”
He pointed out that the directors’
estimate of £6 million as the realis-
able value of the two Holeproof com-
panies was considerably in excess of the
book value but that numerous inquiries
had been received for the companies
and suggested they would be “keenly”
sought after. He seemed to think £4f
million was a more likely figure. But
Mr Landy warned that Factors’ other
assets, real estate for instance, estimated
in the statement to be worth £807,726,
included some items which would be
difficult to realise.
Before getting round to the disposal
of these other assets, Mr Landy has the
job of obtaining the right sort of bids
for the Holeproofs. He has made it
clear that “the highest or any offer will
not necessarily be accepted.” For those
interested, a fee (returnable) of £lO,OOO
must be paid to get a look at the con-
fidential information he has compiled on
Holeproof Australia and £BOOO for
Holeproof New Zealand.
Excessive Pessimism
TTnnecessary prominence was given in
some papers to the 1962-63 results
of Associated Rural Industries Ltd caus-
ing a loss of confidence in the market-
place.
The ss. shares, lately sold at 4s. Bd.,
were quoted 3s. 6d. buyer, 4s. seller,
after the report that profit had retreated
from £96,053 to £19,089.
New earning rate is a meagre 1.8 p.c.,
but the 8 p.c. dividend rate established
two years ago is unaffected.
The chairman plainly stated in Oc-
tober 1962 that the full benefits of the
company’s new investments would not be
derived immediately and the profits for
1963 and possibly 1964 would neces-
sarily be lower.
(It will be remembered that Associated
Rural sold its Parsons Food subsidiary
to General Foods Corporation. Funds
were being reinvested in pastoral and
agricultural properties in WA, and in a
cultured pearl venture on Horn Island).
Progress of the pearling venture was
last year described as most satisfactory.
It was predicted that this could easily be
the company’s most profitable invest-
ment.
Perhaps the latest profit slump was
more than the directors bargained for.
Shareholders will have to wait on the
annual report and chairman's address
to find out. But prima facie, the shares
have speculative appeal for the patient
and modest investor.
Buoyant Island Trader
pV>R the 20th year in succession, the
A island trader and investor W. R.
Carpenter Holdings Ltd increased net
profit. The latest year's 25 p.c. advance
was exceptionally good.
The profit of £1,735,600 was earned
50.8 p.c. within Australia and 49.2 p.c.
outside, in the South Pacific.
Tax provision is low, as usual, at
£803,015, because of the lower inci-
dence of tax on Papua and New
Guinea earnings, and the considerable
income from investments.
Total investments rose from
£4,891,540 to £9,383,958, and there
is a £3 million understatement on the
listed securities, based on current mar-
ket values. The investment income of
£432,574, however, represents an un-
remarkable 4.6 p.c. return on book
value.
The shares held include an approxi-
mate 10 p.c. interest in Woolworths (ac-
quired during 1962-63), a 30 p.c. in-
terest in Dalton Brothers, an 8 p.c. in-
terest in CAGA and an indirect interest
in Associated Securities.
Even after a placement and a share
issue at 150 p.c. premium, the earning
rate was increased marginally to 36.5
p.c., and, in directors’ opinion, justified
a dividend increase of 2} p.c. to \l\ p.c.
Chief item of interest in the balance
sheet is the £1,828,741 addition to
premium reserve, now £1,995,770. At
355. the ss. shares appear poised for
another bonus.
Project Profits
HThe contracting division of Project
A Development Corporation Ltd (run
by E. S. Clementson Pty) handled a
record turnover of £4.7 million during
1962-63.
Value of uncompleted contracts is
considered sufficient to maintain profits
at their present level.
Result for the year to June was a
rise in profit from £166,105 to £216,861,
and in dividend from 10 p.c. to 12i p.c.
New contracts begun include housing
at Nauru and Ocean Islands, Canberra
Hospital extensions, two 20 - storied
blocks of flats in Melbourne, the Cen-
tenary Bridge of prestressed concrete in

Duro Travel-stained
T'he travails of the last three years
A have weakened share market en-
thusiasm for the 20s. shares of Duro
Travel Goods Ltd, now slipping down
around 10s. 9d.
In 1960 directors were so confident
of the company’s ability to ride the
travel boom that they made a three-for-
seven bonus, bringing the 14s. shares
up to 20s. nominal value, and pursued
this with a one-for-two par issue.
These capital moves were announced
in September, 1960, seven months after
removal of import restrictions, and a
couple of months before the credit re-
strictions.
During the early months of 1961,
Duro took the opportunity while busi-
ness was quiet of consolidating all manu-
facturing activities in Brisbane and dis-
posing of the Sydney plant.
Latest result, from a preliminary re-
lease, reveals a profit of £1240 com-
pared with £5584 in 1961-62, £430
in 1960-61, and £.14,535 in the pre-
recession days of 1959-60. No final was
paid last year and no dividend at all
in respect of 1962-63.
Clearly the company’s troubles are
not yet at an end. Shareholders will look
for an explanation of the company’s dif-
ficulties in the annual report, which
directors promised on August 20 to
forward at “an early date”.
Beharfaids’ Clothing Venture
TAiversification from home furnishings
to ladies’ and men’s clothing has
been initially expensive for Bebarfalds
Ltd of Sydney, but apparently is proving
more successful than anticipated.
Results of the new departments ex-
ceeded budget by a fair margin. They
have encouraged directors to introduce
similar departments to the ground floor
of the Parramatta store and extend to
the second floor of the main city store.
Turnover for September, 1963, was an
all-time record, with commensurate
profit result.

Please send me, without obligation, a copy ot your
take, directors arrived at a net profit
of £82,990 for the latest year to June,
compared with £100,016 for 1961-62.
Establishment and development costs,
including dislocation losses, exceeded
£170,000, most of which appears to
have been absorbed in the latest year,
so directors found it a convenient time
to alter their accounting procedure re-
garding profits on instalment sales.
They were able to write back to in-
come £161,230, which had been carried
forward in this connection at June 30,
1962. In future, the provision for earn-
ings to mature (£278,491 at June 30,
1963 compared with £448,230 the year
before) will cover accommodation
charges only.
The old practice was more in accord
with general hire-purchase finance pro-
cedure, but directors assert that the
new method is more in accordance with
retail accounting practice.
It’s always worth keeping in mind that
three Bebarfalds’ directors are also on
lAC's board.
Catching Up On Bad Debts
T>ad debts have proved the bugbear for
yet another finance company, Fi-
nance and Guarantee Co. Ltd.
In 1961-62 it declared a profit of
£107,307 after writing off £88,980 for
bad debts, and before transferring
£20,000 to doubtful debts provision. By
conventional standards, the net profit
was £87,307, or 8.3 p.c. on capital.
The 1962-63 annual accounts show
a net profit of £93,440, before trans-
ferring £35,939 to provision for doubt-
ful debts. Again by the usual standards,
the net profit would have been shown
as £57,444, excluding also a small capital
profit. Earning rate is thus 5.5 p.c.
Directors in their latest annual report
explain that £229,891 has been written
off in the parent company’s accounts
after a thorough review of debtors’ ac-
counts. The write-off was made by trans-
ferring £175,000 from general reserves
and adding £34,591 from current profit
appropriations to the £70,000 provision
for bad debts.
The bad debts were not written off
against current profits because directors
considered they were properly charge-
able against profits earned in earlier
years.
Losses were mainly on advances to
small businesses which have been
squeezed by the development of sub-
urban shopping centres and chain-store
food markets.
A large percentage of the parent com-
pany’s loans are for periods of 12
months or less. The maximum period is
five years. Directors stated that bad
debts on loans made during 1962-63
totalled only £3OO and were written off
against that year’s profits.
Write-offs of £184,063 were also made
in respect of the freeholds, licences and
plant of the two suburban hotels be-
cause of the influence of clubs on their
business.
The engineering subsidiary, C. A.
Burgmann, had difficulties too, with plant
re-siting, establishment of a mining
machinery agency, and the necessity for
substantial write-down of stocks.
This report and omission of final divi-
dend an interim of 5 p.c. was paid
caused a great deal of disquiet for
investors. Now shareholders are advised
not to sell, pending negotiations on a
possible cash offer.
It is worth bearing in mind that the
arcades of shops in Civic Centre, Can-
berra, owned by the project subsidiary
E. M. Farleigh are valuable assets, and
are still in the company’s books at cost.
Bad Debt Drains Canner
market was unprepared for the
preliminary report from J. Gads-
den Australia Ltd to the effect that
profit had fallen 19 p.c. to <£607,676
for the year to June.
The 10s. shares promptly dropped
from 17s. 9d. to 16s. 6d.
Profit was approximately £140,000
down on the 1961-62 result and, of
this, £127,000 is attributed to a bad
debt. No explanation was given, so the
market ponders which of Gadsden’s
customers let the company down so
heavily.

(down £145,074 to £282,526) to a
level rather lower than w'ould be ex-
pected on such a profit possibly bodes
other difficulties experienced during the
past year.
So it might be as well to hold off
buying until the published accounts al-
low' a considered judgment on the com-
pany’s investment status.
In any event the company, while well
established in what is considered a
growth industry, has not exhibited any
great virility. Eight p.c. dividends have
only been sweetened with two par issues
(both one-for-eight) in the last nine
years.
Bad Debts Again
THhe necessity for constant vigilance on
-*• bad and doubtful debts is illustrated
once again by the experience of Sydney
retailer Marcus Clark and Co.
Although the provision for doubtful
debts was £203,978 on July 28, 1962,
directors have since lifted it to £230,000.
Further, bad debts written off in 1962-63
totalled £102,216, compared with the
previous figure of £53,771.
Marcus Clark directors reter in their
preliminary statement to a general
increase in bad debts throughout the
retail and financial world, but admit that
their own procedures in certain stores
left room for improvement. Steps have
been taken to rectify these.
Considering the profit of £167,190
(compared with £184,632 the year
before, after a capital loss of £12,264)
was arrived at after absorbing more
than £lOO,OOO in non-recurring expenses
associated with company reorganisation,
Marcus Clark seems to have come
through fairly well.
Sales rose 16 p.c. to £9.3 million.
Returning a modest 4 p.c. the ss.
shares, however, are quite high enough
for what is at best an income stock.
Dural Leeds Stronger
IY/lelbourne blind and awning maker
Dural Leeds Holdings Ltd revealed
sure inner lining in the 1962-63 balance
sheet.
Intangibles have disappeared, being re-
placed by a surplus on consolidation,
so that net tangible asset backing per
ss. share rose from 6s. to Bs. Liquidity
also improved with the movement in
working capital ratio from 1.8-to-l to
2-to-l.
Integration of new subsidiaries, one
in SA and one in Tasmania, and pur-
chase of another factory facility has
occupied the management, but benefits
should ensue from the increased share of
markets in Victoria, SA and Tasmania.
The ss. shares are currently bringing
18s. 6d. to return 4.0 p.c. on the 15 p.c.
dividend, which is twice covered by re-
cent earnings. Sales in the year to date
are ahead of last year, the chairman
reported in his review.
Fair Warning Given
VTotwithstanding a very fair warning
from the company within 25 days
of the close of the financial year, the
market registered its disappointment
with McDonald Industries Ltd prelimin-
ary report by dropping the shares 9d.
to 9s. 3d.
Directors had advised earlier that
profits would be lower, but the usual
10 p.c. dividend would be covered. The
profit was revealed last week as £86,119,
about half the previous year’s net. Earn-
ing rate was 11.1 p.c.
At 9s. 3d. the yield is 5.4 p.c. There
are distinct prospects of a price improve-
ment over the next year.

Earnings of £.408,809 (in contrast
to the peak of £541,808 in 1959-60)
were still an admirable 31.4 p.c. on
average capital employed.
But investors have belatedly woken
up to the fact that the golden days for
TV manufacturers and distributors are
gone. The shares, which sold up to
28s. 6d. earlier in the year, have fallen
back to saner levels around 225. 3d.
Not too much pessimism should
attach to the statement that Reid-
Murray and Inglis Electrix owe the com-
pany “substantial amounts”. Doubtful
debts provision has been enlarged by
£12,000 to £87,000, and this is con-
sidered well in excess of possible losses
in this respect.
Placer’s Coal Markets
HThe Australian coal interests of Placer
Development Ltd had varying
experiences in the fiscal year to April 30.
Long-term contracts with the Japanese
steel industry protected Wollclift Pty’s
export sales from Japan’s short-term
difficulties. Increased exports of coal of
high coking quality more than made up
for the drop in local sales.
However, Clutha Development Pty
was not so fortunate, and its total sales
fell from 556,000 to 299,000 tons. The
Japanese Government pressured its steel
mills to use locally-produced soft-coking
coal.
A lead-silver area at Zeehan in Tas-
mania is about to be diamond drilled.
Placer shares are currently quoted in
the gold section of the Sydney, Mel-
bourne, Adelaide and Brisbane markets
at around £ll 10s.
Two Dehs
Thirst sales of the ss. shares of United
Telecasters, the third commercial
TV station in Sydney, were from 12s. to
11s. 6d., to give stags the biggest profit
for many moons.
Hesitation on the overall market
perhaps put an effective ceiling on the
price, but it seems a foregone con-
clusion that genuine investors will be
rewarded well, over the medium term.
Moteliers Ltd, the operator of Town
House Motels in Canberra, Wagga and
Young, put in a maiden appearance the
same day. The ss. shares, placed at
6s. 71d. were initially quoted at 7s.
buyer, 7s. 6d. seller.
Since prospectus was issued, the com-
pany has revealed expansionary moves
in the Sydney metropolitan area, and
extensions planned for Canberra.
The market is not so receptive to
motel floats as it once was. Moteliers
Ltd (in which CAGA and the MLC are
shareholders) may prove better than the
industry average.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Mercantile Mutual Projections
A fter a lapse of three years, the Mer-
cantile Mutual Insurance Co. has
announced that it will raise addi-
tional ordinary capital amounting to
over £338,000 by a rights issue in the
ratio of l-for-7. So far as shareholders
are concerned, there will be a substantial
bonus content in this issue as the new
shares are offered at par, i.e. 205., where-
as on the basis of the last sale price cum
rights of 121 s. they would be worth 107 s.
3d. approximately.
Over the last 10 years the company
has had a remarkable record of new
issues and the table below indicates the
growth that has occurred in a holding of
800 shares acquired in, say, December
1954. This table is based on the rather
artificial assumption that the investor
would not put any more cash into the
investment but would sell all his rights
and use the proceeds to acquire old
shares. Brokerage is ignored in this theo-
retical exercise and the purchase of old
shares (instead of the more usual pro-
cedure of selling sufficient rights to take
up the balance) is used to simplify the
dividend record.

(a) Adjusted as new issue made between dividend
payments during year.
(b) Assuming maintenance of 12J p.c. dividend rate.
The average annual compound rate of
growth in dividend income over this
period has been about 8 p.c. if allowance
is made for the fact that the increase has
been greater in the latter half of the
period.
If a purchase of 700 shares is made to-
day and the 100 rights taken up, the total
cost of this holding will be £4,325 and it
will produce an income from the 1964-65
year of £lOO from the assumed dividend
rate of 12+ p.c. The immediate yield will
be therefore 2.3 p.c. If it is expected
that the record of the last ten years will
be repeated in perpetuity then the ulti-
mate yield will be 10 p.c.
Nobody can foresee the future but we
can look at historical trends and make
some assessment of the probability that
“earnings” can increase at a sufficient
rate to meet the requirements of the
dividend.
The new issue will raise the dividend
payout from £296,000 to £338,000 in
1964-65 and, if numerous other factors
relating to price of shares etc. are
repeated in the future, then this payout
could need to increase to £1,005,000 by
1974-75 to maintain the 8 p.c. growth
rate in dividend per share.
There can be little doubt today that
insurance companies pay their dividends
out of investment income. Underwriting
surplus is invested to increase the
dividend income. Using information
from published accounts and including
all freehold and leasehold properties as
investments, the following table can be
constructed.

1962 11272 388 3.46
1963 12383 447 3.71
With a view to preserving continuity,
I have used the parent company figures
only in this exercise, which means that
the substantial investment in subsidiary
companies has been included as an
‘‘investment” and the income therefrom
is only the dividends received. If we use
consolidated figures in the 1962-63 year
the net return would be nearly 5 p.c.
instead of the 3.71 p.c. shown in our
schedule.
If we assume that the rate of increase
in the net return will continue for the
next ten years then by 1974-75 the rate
should be about 6 p.c.; this will mean
that the book value of investments will
need to increase to at least £16.75 million
if the income therefrom is to cover the
dividend payout which we have assumed
to be necessary by that time.
This increase of about £3.5 million is
clearly well within the company’s
capacity from retentions alone. Over the
last ten years underwriting surplus has
averaged over £160,000 per annum. So
even if this figure does not increase at
all with increasing premium income then
£1.6 million would be added. The
surplus investment income should add at
least another £1.9 million over this
period.
If new issues took place on exactly
the same basis as over the last ten years
these could add as much as £l4 million.
But at this stage one’s mind boggles at
the size of these amounts in relation to
present total assets and shareholders’
funds.
The only conclusion that one can come
to is that despite the low immediate
yield, the shares seem to be worth the
present price on the basis of past per-
formance. The long-term investor has
every prospect of seeing the rate of
growth in his dividend income increasing
at the same rates as in the past, while
for those who have a shorter term out-
look it may be worth mentioning that
the market value of the holding of 800
shares mentioned earlier in this analysis
has increased at the average annual com-
pound rate of just over 12 p.c.
The only fallacy in applying this
historical factor is that when the shares
were purchased they were showing a
yield of 4 p.c. As today the yield would
only be 2.3 p.c., market growth at the
same rate in the future envisages not only
the same increase in dividend income but
also a fall in yield by 1974-75, say to
1.3 p.c.!
I can only suggest that for the long-
term holder the shares seem to be an
eminently sound investment but the
possibilities of short-term appreciation
must be limited.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
The Super Bounty
I|3he Commonwealth Government’s ac-
tion in granting a £-3 per ton
bounty on superphosphate, as from
August 14, 1963, has increased the in-
vestment status of all fertilizer com-
panies.
Superphosphate represents about
90 p.c. of fertilizer usage in Australia.
It is mainly used for pasture improve-
ment and to some extent on crops.
The bounty, representing from 25 to
30 p.c. of the cost to the farmer, will
greatly influence the use of high analy-
sis nitrogen fertilizers and benefit all
companies engaged in its production.
Australian Fertilizers 20s. shares are
currently rated on a 2.5 p.c. yield basis,
while the shares bring 665. compared
with 535. in March ex the one-for-three
issue at ss. premium.
This company is the major producer
of superphosphate in NSW, with plants
at Port Kembla, Granville and Villawood,
and has a half-interest in the sole Queens-
land producer, ACF and Shirleys Fer-
tilizers Ltd.
ACF and Shirleys is now classified
as a subsidiary, under the new Com-
panies Act of 1961, so its accounts have
been consolidated with Australian Fer-
tilizers in the last two years.
Cuming Smith is the joint owner of
ACF and Shirleys, which increased profit
by £38,380 to £181,284, in 1962-63.
The proportion of group profit due to
Australian Fertilizers shareholders rose
from £223,862 to £261,453, after pro-
viding £284,062 for tax (1962 £278,728)
and £359,067 (£318,691) for deprecia-
tion and obsolescence.
Earning rate on higher average capital
employed by Australian Fertilizers rose
from 15.9 p.c. to 16.4 p.c. The company
seems wedded to the 8 p.c. dividend
rate which it established in 1954.
George Shirley Pty, a wholly owned
subsidiary, commenced trading during
1961-62, and was profitable in the year
under review. It makes and distributes
ground sulphur and battery-grade sul-
phuric acid.
Unfavorably wet conditions in NSW
during May and June, 1963, and higher
rail freights from November last did
not prevent Australian Fertilizers from
increasing superphosphate sales by 11.6
p.c. in the latest year.
At Port Kembla, a wet process phos-
phoric acid plant and a high analysis
granulated NPK plant, which will be the
first of their kind in Australia, will be
fully installed by January, 1964. The
phosphoric acid plant is to have a daily
capacity of 100 tons.
Enriched superphosphate will be made
after phosphoric acid production in-
creases. Construction of the large con-
tract sulphuric acid plant has been post-
poned; an existing plant being modi-
fied and expanded.
This substantial expansion programme
has been partly financed by the premium
share issue and a placement with
ICIANZ, which increased total capital
by £602,828, and contributed £250,707
in share premiums.
The capital now comprises £1,696,252
in ordinary shares, and £316,958 in prim-
ary producers’ shares, all of 20s. denomi-
nation.
' Major shareholders in the company
are ICIANZ, which bought 100,000
shares in November, 1962, at 455. a
share after selling out its minority hold-
ing of 190,000 shares at 28s. each five
years previously. Boral, which has a 13
p.c. share interest since acquisition of
Mount Lyell Investments; and Cuming
Smith which owns 235,200 Australian
Fertilizers shares.
The primary producers’ shares can be
held only by primary producers or com-
panies which directors declare to be
primary producers. A holder may elect
to have any number in excess of 50
converted to ordinary shares, and a
holder of ordinary shares can convert any
number to primary producers’ shares.
They rank equally with ordinary shares
for dividend and entitle holders to a
rebate on purchases of 6s. a ton.
ACF has decided to take a leading
part in the agricultural aviation field.
Financial interests are held in Aerial
Agriculture Pty and Hazelton Air Ser-
vices Holdings, which spread record
quantities during 1962-63.
The sugar industry, which is ACF and
Shirleys’ best customer, would be using
more fertilizers for greater cane pro-
duction and the development of briga-
low country means favorable prospects
for this company in the coming year.
During 1962-63, Australian Fertilizers
was appointed chief distributor in NSW
for ICIANZ’s nitrogeneous fertilizer pro-
ducts made at Botany. These two com-
panies, with Sulphide Corporation Pty,
are investigating the use of these fer-
tilizers, including direct application of
anhydrous ammonia.
The latest annual report declares that
by comparison with the rest of the world,
Australia’s use of nitrogenous fertilizer
is negligible. While in the pattern of
fertilizer progress phosphorus is basic,
nitrogen and occasionally potassium are
equally essential. Australian agriculture
is just entering the second stage.
It would be hard to select a stock on
any Australian list which has more sta-
bility, yet at the present time greater
capacity for growth, than Australian
Fertilizers.

PERPETUAL TRUSTEE COMPANY LIMITED,

CELLULOSE AUSTRALIA LTD
A Need for New Funds
obvious thing about the 1962-63
accounts of Cellulose Australia Ltd
is the paucity of working capital.
In 1960 the company embarked on
a £3.2 million expansion of its pulping
mill at Snuggery, via Millicent, in south
eastern SA. This was designed to increase
output of paper board from 16,000 to
39,000 tons a year.
An early call to shareholders, or pre-
ferably a long-term loan while interest
rates are so reasonable, seems inevitable
The only loan capital the company has
is £855,000 in 8 p.c. unsecured notes
which convert to ordinary shares on
September 30, 1964. Noteholders rank
equally with shareholders for any cash
issue before conversion date, so in any
consideration of such an issue the pre-
sent “share capital” is £2,280,000.
In the past, issues have been in gener-
ous proportions. The note issue, made in
September, 1960, was three-for-two. This
was also the ratio for a par issue in Sep-
tember, 1961.
The present premium on the shares
indicates that a premium issue would
be acceptable, and the premiums col-
lected would bolster reserves, which so
far comprise “general” and unappro-
priated profits.
The capital investment made in 1962-
63, year ended June 30, entitled the
company to claim the new investment
allowance which became effective in
February, 1962. So much so, that the
company deemed a provision for taxa-
tion was not necessary in respect of
1962-63 profits.
After providing £46,739 (last year
£47,549) for depreciation, the net profit
was £272,334, compared with £133,511
after tax of £86,081 in 1961-62.
Had the company been obliged to
pay tax this last year, its liquidity would
have been severely strained. A net cash
position of £86,052 on 1962 balance
date was converted to a debit balance of
£496,736 by June 30, 1963.
During the year, APM paid Cellulose
£400,000, being the final instalment for
the purchase of Cellulose’s share in
Apcel. (This was a venture to use SA’s
softwood resources for pulp and tissue
papers, but technical difficulties arose
which both parties felt would be better
solved under single ownership. Cellulose
lost about £200,000 on the project.)
A second machine was brought into
operation during 1962-63, which will
continue to operate at low speeds and
under trial conditions over the next six
months. Production increased 20 p.c. over
the preceding year, to 20,172 tons.
Sales accelerated from £1,614,270 to
£1,907,623, with the assistance of in-
creased tariff protection from June, 1962.
Comparative balance sheets for 1962
and 1963 show a net increase in fixed
assets of approximately £1,133,000 after
nominal depreciation charges. The ac-
counts omit to state the proposed capital
expenditure for the current year, so there
is no lead given on the company’s pos-
sible tax liability in 1963-64.
The 10 p.c. dividend paid in the last
five years seems sound enough, but next
year’s earning rate may not be as high,
even with increased profitability from the
new machine, if normal tax rates apply
to 1963-64 profits.
Information on the company’s plans
for more permanent capital would take
some of the guesswork out of evaluation
of Cellulose shares.
The ss. shares presently yield an un-
exciting 4.4 p.c.

DAVID JONES LTD
Still Tensed for Expansion
A falling off in the rate of capital
expenditure on new stores should
remove the pressure on David Jones"
earning capacity in the current year.
Result of trading operations for the
latest term was a lift in profit from
£1,807,339 to £1,931,376, after tax of
£1,161,047 (1961-62 £1,176,352) and
depreciation of £432,891 (£288,274).
Earning rate fell back slightly to
27.4 p.c., against unchanged dividend of
121 p.c.
No longer-term predictions should be
made though, for this dynamic retailer
will not relax its expansionary efforts for
long. At July 31, 1963, commitments on
uncompleted contracts amounted to
£490,000, whereas the year before it was
£1,250,252.
The Canberra (Monaro Mall) and
Brookvale (Warringah Mall) stores
open for business in March and April,
1963, respectively. Establishment costs
were absorbed during the year just com-
pleted. Directors said turnover of both
stores was satisfactory, but presumably
they are not yet profitable.

White Burgundy
MADE IN
WESTERN
AUSTRALIA
BY
David Jones in many years was the
Parramatta store, which opened in
November, 1961.
Adelaide's store was rebuilt by
November, 1962. No doubt profits were
affected by the reconstruction operations,
but the first year’s trading amply exceed-
ed an “optimistic budget”.
Although Myer has invaded the Syd-
ney market via Farmers, it does not
appear to have profited greatly thereby.
David Jones is obviously not going to be
drawn into the Melbourne arena. In-
stead, Queensland seems to offer DJ’s
better scope for provincial development
by takeover.
Just before balance date, the company
bought out Marsh and Webster Pty of
Mackay, and in mid-September, 1963,
Bollands Pty of Cairns joined the group
after negotiation initiated by Bollands.
McKimmins in Townsville was taken
over in 1960. T. C. Beirne,
the Brisbane store absorbed in Novem-
ber, 1961, also has 40 p.c. interests in
Beirne stores in Ipswich and Mackay,
but these are not managed by David
Jones.
Apart from stores already mentioned,
the DJ’s retail empire incorporates
Finney Isles in Brisbane, Walter Lance
in Wollongong, Scotts in Newcastle,
Charles Birks in Adelaide and what was
Bon Marche in Perth. There is also a
store in Wagga.
The company also has manufacturing
interests Marlborough Productions
(clothing) and Selby Shoes and dis-
tributes cigarettes and tobacco through-
out NSW.
Immediate capital requirements for
the expansion programme were partly
satisfied by the February issue of one-
for-six ss. shares or one-for-three 10s.
notes held at 3s. premium, which raised
almost £2 million. During the year, direc-
tors arranged to borrow another £2 mil-
lion on mortgage, of which £1,850,000
has been received to date.
This mortgage money will be repaid
in annual sums of £126,500 as from the
current year.
The cash issue was the first share
issue DJ’s had made in 12 years. But
£2,691,003 in notes, which convert to
ordinary shares next balance date, were
issued in April, 1961.
Shareholders received a 78-for-100
bonus in 1957-58. Otherwise, ordinary
capital has only grown by takeover. The
employees’ provident fund took up
£610,000 in 5 p.c. redeemable preference
shares in September, 1959.
By July 1962 a provision for increased
cost of building replacement of
£1,046,000 had been set aside out of
retained profits, against which £320,944
was written off from the rebuilding of
the Adelaide store. A further £250,000
was set aside in 1962-63 and the balance
of the account incorporated in revenue
reserves.
Share premium reserve was increased
during 1962-63 from £275,000 to
£1,211,523 as a result of the premium
issue to shareholders (£741,523) and the
issue to acquire Marsh and Webster.
The £1,022,338 provision for diminu-
tion in stock values, intended to cover
markdowns, inter-company profits on
manufactured stocks and possible losses
on retail fashion goods, has been virtually
unchanged since it was first shown
separately in 1960-61 accounts. The net
value of stocks is now £10,161,104.
Strategic offshoots in Sydney suburbs
and interstate should not be allowed to
camouflage the fact that the three
Sydney city stores, Elizabeth Street,
Market Street and George Street, are the
company’s chief forts.
These stores are continually being
modernised. The George Street store is
currently receiving most attention, to
take advantage of increasing trade in that
end of the city. Escalators are now being
installed to the sixth floor.
The ss. shares at 21s. to yield
3 p.c. are not to be thrown out by
anyone but the short-term investor.

ALFRED LAWRENCE HOLDINGS
An Essential Stability
T>ublic investment in Australian food
A producers is becoming more and
more limited. Those with a mind to a
share in this staple industry could take
a look at Alfred Lawrence Holdings Ltd
of Melbourne.
Although its products are rarely
mentioned in company reports, it serves
the food and beverage industries. The
main line appears to be the production
of essences.
The holding company was formed in
December, 1959, by offering 20 ss.
ordinary shares for each 20s. ordinary
share in the old company and five ss.
ordinary shares for each 20s. preference
share. Paid capital of the holding com-
pany was then £700,315.
Issue of 210,644 ordinary ss. shares

Publishing Co. Pty, has been associated
with the printing industry since 1882.
The chairman said in his 1962-63
address that seasonal conditions were
poor for most of the year, sales, gross
profits and expenses of the main operat-
ing subsidiary were steady, with a small
improvement in net profit.
Group profit, excluding profit on sale
of assets, rose from £78,418 to £85,086,
and included Craftsman’s profits for nine
months only.
There is an NZ subsidiary, whose assets
were revalued in 1960-61. Both the NZ
and publishing subsidiaries produced
satisfactory sales and profits for 1962-63.
Exports were being pushed in South-
East Asia, with encouraging results.
The four-for-one bonus to ordinary
shareholders, which was the effect of
the holding company’s creation four
years ago, precludes the likelihood of
any capital benefits in the short to
medium term.
But the company is unostentatiously
notching new records. Shareholders will
benefit with higher dividends.
An investment in the ss. shares at
10s. lOd. to return an immediate 4.4 p.c.
should not be misplaced for purchasers
who regard stability above great potential
allied with great risk.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Who Really Owns Australia
6O Families Who Own Aus-
tralia” is my choice for the book of
the week. In fact as far as investment re-
search goes, it should be the book of the
year.
That it is written by a Communist,
E. W. Campbell, gives the book much
wider appeal. In the introductory chap-
ters a brief history is given of these 60
families to which the title refers, and
their whereabouts. The right address to
have would seem to be St. Georges Rd,
Toorak. Nine of its residents direct 43
companies with an aggregate capital of
more than £294 million.
The book goes on to describe the origin
and development of the major companies
in Australia. Members of the 60 families
have been and still are strongly represen-
ted on the boards of these companies.
Quoting Mr Campbell in his illustration
and comment of the growth of BHP:
“If an original holder of a half share in
the syndicate of seven subscribers had
retained his interest and taken up all
subsequent shares to which he was en-
titled, he would today own 4,018,463
shares worth £10,247,080. Such are the
fruits of capitalist accumulation.”
Shortly after BHP shares were listed
in August 1885, the £2O shares were
quoted at £l7. Three years later, the
price was £397! A little unlike the per-
formance of BHP over the last three
years, and perhaps the next three.
Whilst a great many interesting facts
are given, some of the commentary
seems twisted! The Menzies Government
is supposed to have supported the Ver-
woerd Government of South Africa
because any criticism might affect such
Australian companies as Henry Jones
and Felt and Textiles, which operate
in South Africa.
Nevertheless I would recommend the
book to investors and Communists. If
you are both, so much the better.
Mr Campbell must have been pleased
with the sad turn of events in the last
few days. Until the elections at the end
of November, it will be very much a
case of selective buying.
The first company I pitched for this
week was Broken Hill South. The con-
tributing shares reacted down a little after
the call some weeks ago but didn’t take
long to resume their upward trend. In-
creasing production at Broken Hill of
both lead and zinc, combined with much
improved world prices, should ensure a
further substantial increase in profits
this year.
In the longer term, the 16.6 p.c. inter-
est in the aluminium group, Alcoa of
Australia Pty Ltd, should begin to con-
tribute to profits by 1965. The other
notable development is the copper mine
at Cobar. It looks a very promising pros-
pect. A purchase of 400 at 11s. 6d. cost
£236.
Despite the general feeling of pessi-
mism, I also ventured into the industrial
market by buying Larke Consolidated.
Larke’s record in recent years has been
anything but steady. A chart of the
earning rate consists of a series of jagged
edges.
Directors were acutely aware of this
situation. Hence their policy of related
diversification. A pure motor distributor
in 1956, the company now terms itself a
motor industrialist and product engineer.
More specifically it assembles several
leading makes of cars, distributes BMC
vehicles, Fiat vehicles and spare parts,
and manufactures industrial chains and
aluminium products.
This year's result was spectacular.
Profit doubled to £303,600 and earning
rate jumped to 28 p.c. What’s more,
most of this profit (£183,000) was earned
in the second half. With £400,000 cash
on hand, the company is looking around
for an additional business.
The ss. share looks well worth the
11s. I paid!
United Telecasters came on with a
bang on Thursday. On that day the share-
market absorbed 200,000 shares without
hardly flinching. Working on the assump-
tion that once the stags were out the
market would rise, I doubled my holding.
Perhaps I would have bought more
except for the uncertainty of the market.
Realized profits are probably better
than paper profits in this market. So out
went the 1000 A. V. Jennings at a profit
of £9B and the 400 Cahills at a profit
of £l4.
This week’s transactions were:
SOLD
1000 A. V. Jennings, 13/- £637
400 Cahills, 12/3 £240
BOUGHT
400 Larke, 11/- £226
400 Broken Hill South Ctg, 11/6 £236
400 United Telecasters, 12/- £246
The world sugar price has now risen
to £9O sterling a ton, so the week closed
on a very happy note.

Profits From Moving
IVTelbourne companies have come out
in a rash of new issues in the last
week or so. One that looks set for
success is the one-for-four at par issue
of ss. shares by the city's well-known
furniture removers and storers, Wridg-
ways Auburn Holdings, who coinciden-
tally have announced a £25,040 in-
crease to £37,069 in profit for the year
to June 30 last. That in itself is suf-
ficiently healthy portent of success for
the new appeal to shareholders. One just
didn’t have any idea that moving house
was in such vogue last year, or was it
that this fairly new listed company was
just managing to get into full stride?
Wridgways is, of course, one of the
leading removalists in the country with
subsidiaries in several States and also
ACT.


THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Wool Seeks a Subsidy
Orderly Marketing versus Promotion
A ustralian woolgrowers have not
been above accepting a subsidy here
and there as members of the general
farming community, but as an industry
they have always shied away from the
idea of Government assistance as though
it were an adder believing that the
price for taking it would be some of the
freedom that enables them to run their
affairs, if not well, at least by themselves.
Now, however, wool may become the
first Australian industry of any size to
receive a Federal subsidy for the pro-
motion of its product.
Bogged down in deadlock over wool
promotion and marketing, and with the
International Wool Secretariat waiting
anxiously to know whether Australian
producers will back its expensive new
plans, the wool industry has asked the
Federal Government to come to the
rescue to the tune, it is said, of
£7 million a year.
All Sir William Gunn, chairman of
the Australian Wool Board and of the
IWS, would say at a recent Press con-
ference was that the amount of the assist-
ance contemplated was “substantial.”
He said the £5l million that could
be expected from double-deduction taxa-
tion concessions allowed to other export
industries developing new markets would
not satisfy the small wool producer. The
Board has recommended an income for
itself of £ 14 million a year for the next
five years to meet its commitments under
the IWS's promotional blueprint for that
term.
It is generally believed that the for-
mula of £-for-£ will enable the Gov-
ernment to give the industry a sum of
about the right size.
A subsidy for wool promotion may
be the Federal Government’s only way
of saving the country’s largest export
earner from the impasse created by the
insistence of its numerous smaller grow-
ers on putting orderly marketing before
promotion. More important, it may be
the only way of saving itself.
The wool issue has emerged as the
one most likely to unseat the Govern-
ment at the next election. A reminder
that Sir William Gunn's round-Australia
wool levy crusade was part of more
than a straight-out promotion issue
occurred when he was called to Canberra
halfway through the campaign to ex-
plain why it looked like a fizzer.
At his recent Press conference Sir
William said the Board hoped to be in
a position to make recommendations on
wool marketing by mid-1964 and
added last week, at his second Hamilton
meeting, that he would resign if the
Board did not make recommendations,
based on its committee’s findings, that
would satisfy most growers.
Many had hoped the committee in-
vestigating the subject would have
showed its hand in an interim report
scheduled for December, but Sir Wil-
liam has warned against expecting much
from it. This might mean the Australian
Wool Industry Conference at its January
meeting will vote on the question of
raising the promotion levy without con-
clusive evidence from the wool market-
ing committee.
would either constitute another
instance of disregard for marketing as
a concomitant of promotion or lead to
further delay on an issue that has al-
ready become perennial.
In Victoria there are at least two
electorates, Wannon and Wimmera, that
are susceptible to swinging votes. Both
have had leading primary votes in the
past for Labor, but have been held by
non-Labor candidates in recent years on
preferences. Although Malcolm Fraser,
who has looked after Wannon for the
Liberals since the retirement of Labor’s
Donald McLeod some years ago, is hard-
working and conscientious about keep-
ing himself before the electors, he is one
of the most vulnerable politicians in Aus-
tralia.
The Victorian Wheat and Wool-
growers’ Association, champion of or-
derly wool marketing in Victoria, has
threatened to “go political” to forestall
legislation for increasing the wool pro-
motion levy if the Wool Industry Con-
ference decides this way in January.
Pressure could be put on Fraser to vote
against the legislation and defeat the
Government on the issue.
In the event of an election before
January, all Federal candidates could
be presented with a questionaire as to
where they stand on the marketing of
wool, with the object of committing suc-
cessful candidates. This technique helped
to bring about wheat stabilisation in the
forties.
Wimmera is another swinging seat,
this time between Liberal and Country
parties. The Country Party candidate,
Bob King, a member, along with Mal-
colm Fraser, of the VWWGA, won the
seat from Bill Lawrence (Liberal) on
DLP preferences, despite the fact that
the highest primary vote was Labor.
Both King and the Liberal candidate
could be put on the spot by an area
steeped in the orderly-marketing philo-
sophy, first through wheat stabilisation
and later, as the adoption of ley-farming
methods after the Second World War
brought sheep more into wheat-growing,
by the outlook of the VWWGA.
Other electorates made vulnerable by
the situation include the Mallee, which
has the added uncertainty of the dried
fruits industry, and some ‘Lot” seats in
Western Australia.
Wannon, however, remains a pivot
for the Government’s apprehensions.
This big electorate embraces much of
the Western District that has traditionally
harbored the blue-bloods of woolgrowing.
Its “capital” is Hamilton, scene of the
wild opening night of Sir William Gunn’s
levy campaign.
But Wannon electorate and the West-
ern District are not what they were. A
silent social revolution has taken place
since the war with the breaking up of
the spacious old estates and the advent
of soldier and closer settlement. Today
Hamilton is surrounded by droves of
small settlers with holdings averaging
perhaps 500 acres, and for those who
went on to blocks in recent years, when
wool prices were the appeal of
orderly marketing is potent.
The VWWGA, which could not gain
a toehold in the area before the war,
signed up 2000 woolgrowers there on
its reserve price wool plan alone. It is
now the major woolgrowing organisa-
tion in a region that used to be the
domain of squatters through the Vic-
torian Graziers’ Association.
Another consideration is that Patrick
Healy, the man charged with throwing
flour bombs at Sir William during the
Hamilton meeting, is a DLP aspirant
who could lead preferences to Labor if
Fraser were unwilling to declare himself
against the levy legislation. If Fraser
were defeated and the present state of
party strength in Parliament Were main-
tained, he could pull the Government
with him. The possibilities must also be
measured against Labor’s promise to put
marketing before promotion if elected.
In the Government’s present position,
£7 million may decide whether it rides
home on the sheep’s back or is bucked
off half way.
