THE RED PAGE
The Other Us.
THE most interesting speculation
Carl Snyder’s The Cosmic Mach in
recently reviewed on this page,
his presentation of the probability o
more than one duplicate of this eart
being existent in Space. Science tells
that there must necessarily be an enorn
ous number of inhabitable worlds; an
we are now assured that the stuff of th
universe is all of the same texture. Als
we can scarcely conceive that our ow
solar system is unique. Thus we are lec
logically to the conclusion that ther
must be at least many similar globe
throughout the almost infinite concours
of worlds.
Let us conceive that there are in the sk
no more than, say, a thousand million sun
If our solar system be anything of an averac
type this would mean five or ten thousanc
million planets that might be, at some perioc
or other of their cooling off, the seat of a
animal population, perhaps of a civilisatio
and an intellectual development somethin
akin to our own.
How let us take a far outside figure fo
the age (or life-time) of our own planetary
system—say, a thousand million years
And our human civilisation, at som
point or other over the earth, has held a
about its present level for ten or twenty
thousand years. How for our inference
Let us say that the civilised life of mankind
represents a hundred-thousandth part of the
conceivably habitable period of our solar
system, in any portion of it, and assume this
system to be a universal type. It follows
that it would need but a universe oi
a hundred thousand suns to conceive thai
there is at least one other existing planet
which has reached a stage of evolution al-
most identically equal to our own. If we
may reckon with a thousand million suns [as
seems more likely] the chances are there
may be ten thousand, such parallel worlds. It
is quite beyond the powers of the human
mind vividly to picture the existence of
10,000 vast globes, like the earth, each with
its continents, its white and black and yel-
low races, and a wearisome line of Alex-
anders and Csesars, of Tammerlanes and
Hubla Khans. Let us then come a little
closer, pursue our fancy further.
Conceiving our civilisation as dating back
ten thousand years, if there be ten thousand
planets of about the same degree of mental
development as earth’s humankind, it fol-
lows that there is at least one wherein the
concourse of human history might be exactly
parallel to our own
The fanciful mind might even reflect
upon an even closer possible parallelism,
upon some planet distant so far that even
the light of its central sun is shut from our
eyes —a parallelism of each of our human
lives. Even upon our own earth, it is only
our lack of imagination, conditioned in the
very narrow limits of human intercourse,
that hinders us from realising that, among
the billion folk who tread this ancient earth”
each one of us must have hundreds, or per-
haps thousands, of alter egos.
\f>
The human pattern is, after all, not so
diverse. .The majority of us have to get
along with merely one pattern of brain,
one more or less serviceable pair of legs,
one nose, one wife, and a quite common-
place arrangement of toes. Some of us,
it is true, have a mother-in-law, some not
—otherwise the race seems depressingly
devoid of individual interest. And
there are only two sexes, and quite
a small number of religions, and a
monotonous arrangement of weather, and
practically no variety in grocers or poli-
ticians, and a quite uninteresting itera-
tion of years. And each of us is born,
and married (except for a few noble ex-
ceptions), and has to get through a num-
ber of years, and appears in the death
notices, and subsequently in the in memo-
riam notices with the same bad rimes
and stolen sentiment. It seems remark-
able that long ago the race, depressed by
its lack of individuality, did not commit
suicide. But even then it would not
have been original, and even then there
is only a limited number of ways of com-
mitting suicide. And, nowadays, so
unoriginal is the world getting, there is
only one way of getting married.
Our human pride bids each of us deem
that he is in some sense unique, and that he
orders his life after an especial fashion of his
own. Could we visualise the reality,
should discover that we are, each one of u
but one of a thousand, or one of ten tho
sand, whose ideas, ambitions, dreams, anc
daily lives are, in all essential ways, ide
tical. . . .
All the advance of physical knowled 0
tends always to reveal a single operativ
cause at work through a variety of phenon
ena. The analogy irresistibly suggests th
if we ever attain to an extended knowledg
of cosmos, it will be found to be relative r
simple, following much the sa ne course of
development, and built on much the sam
pattern.
The obvious inference from this is tha
Life, sensations, passions, intelligence, ar
an evident condition or result of materia
organisation. Not unique upon our ow
planet, they are probably part of the un -
versal order, if a universal order exists.
That being so, it follows that the activitie
of life, the reflexes of our sensations, th
impulses of our passions, the leadings of oi *
intelligence, are all a part of the cosm c
order that is to say, if it exist, of th
cosmic machine.
Thus, every thought of yours, ever
sneeze, every happiness, every foolisl
ness, every experience, every hope, an
every despair are all a part of cosmic
phenomena, kin to all the rest of th
universe, and probably distributed wit
cosmic prodigality over the universe
-And all that we experience, wish for
think of, has its probable counterpart ir
thousands, possibly millions, of sirnila
beings with identical sensations ant
emotions, some separated from us by th
width of a street, some by spaces million
of times the distance of the sun.
Phenomena so widespread can hardly be
the result of individual and diverse causes
We can only infer that our lives are a
strictly conditioned and as strictly orderec
as the march of the planets or the flash of
shooting-star in the skies.
Intelligence— that is, our mental faculty
(says Arrhenius)—is simply a function of
definite physical organisation. So nowhere
in the universe can we conceive of forms o: :
intelligence of a different order than our
own. The development may be higher, as
we know that it may be lower. Its limita
tions will remain more or less our limita-
tions.
\t/
So we are forced to the conclusion that
there must be at least a thousand worlds
similar to ours, and among this number
the chances are that there is at least one
globe almost exactly the same as ours.
And if so, the component parts of that
globe must be—in the main—the same
as of the earth ; so that you and I (or a
passable imitation of you and me'
are existing at this moment on
some other earth lost in Space.
It is a depressing thought that every
emotion of yours is being duplicated,
afar off, by another you. The kiss you
gave your girl last night was simul-
taneous with the kiss you (somewhere
in the back-blocks behind the Southern
Ctoss) gave a girl (twin to your girl) in
that other Manly across the desert of
Space. And (more depressing still), at
this precise moment of writing, another
Red Page editor over the way is pain-
fully spoiling another identical Red Page
with the same unoriginal thoughts ; and
at the moment of your reading this
second-hand remark, another you is also
reading it in that other Page of exactly
the same eye-worrying color, and deciding,
like you, that The Bulletin is not as
bright as it was. Were the subject
not too painful for further development,
it might prove interesting (though
second-hand) to develop the excessive
gloom that comes from the thought (un-
original) that there is the same Wade
over there, the same Daily Telegraph, the
same spring-poet waiting'to be reviewed
even—though this seems inconceivable
the same Bruce Smith. But the other
I, over the cosmic way, has just come tp
the same conclusion, and
we two (or more) Ps lay down the same
pen, and wearily take up tlpe same spring-
poet and look up the same private dic-
tionary of Bad Words. And even the
Bad Words are the same !

Australian Publications
The Coming Day , by John Daniel Kerr
Aitken, who is his own printer at Moonee
Ponds (Vic.), dawns with a deliberate and
avowed imitation of Bernard O’Dowd, and
dies in evening hymns. It is “dead easy”
to o’dowd. and J. D. K. Aitken o’dowds
with facility :
O’er scaling ladders ranged with pain
We clear Tradition’s wall.
But he stings his benefactor when he re-
marks :
Our hope is found in Him alone,
Creator. Saviour, King,
Before Whose great eternal throne
The countless angels sing.
A writer who could print that verse, or a
printer who could write it, could do anything,
and Aitken does :
The Holy Bible is a light,
That all may see the way
To shun the pitfalls of the night
That none might walk astray.
However, we are grateful to Aitken for two
things : he prints a list of Biblical references
contained in his poems, and he does not
publish his photograph.
A true and well-written account of the
career of John Vane, Bushranger, edited by
Charles White (author of Old Convict Days,
and Australian Btishranging), is the latest
of the shilling publications of the N.S. W.
Bookstall Co. Vane was a member of the
gang of the notorious Ben Hall, and, wher
blood had been spilt, decided for a quieter
life, and left his mates. On his way t<
give himself up he lost a revolver, and, going
back at night to look for it, heard a sho;
fired at a short distance. He fired in return
and found in the morning that his assailant
had been a kangaroo, who had found the
revolver, and in scratching it, had explodec
the charge. All the other members o: :
the gang were shot dead, while Vane, by
surrending, escaped with a term of imprison
merit, ending his days in 1906 in the Cowra
a Hospital. It is an exciting yarn, and true
A Man of Sympathy, by Harry Tighe
(N.S.W. Bookstall Co., Is.), is of note
merely because it shows that in Australia we
can turn out the average mechanical novel so
popular in England. This story has no
interest save as a story, and its conventional
and rather melodramatic plot, with its con-
venient death of the villain, is just the sort
of plot that publishers 'like. The pity is
that publishers like this sort of plot. How-
ever, Harry Tighe knows his Australia and
also his England.
It looks as if Australia is gaining a
monopoly in the writing of children’s books.
Ethel Turner and Lilian Turner need no
recommendation to any English-speaking
child*; and Lilian Turner’s latest, Paradise
and the Perrys (Ward, Lock) needs mention
merely to say that it is up to the high
standard set by the writer. A new-comer in
this special field is Evelyn Goode, whose
Days That Speak (Ward, Lock) fulfils nearly
all the requirements of a child’s story book.
Indeed, Evelyn Goode writes with a charm
and a finish rare in a literary novice, though
her work seems less for the eyes of children
than for those of their mother. A big-worded
sentence such as this, occurring in the
first chapter, would nonplus the average
child, even the average Australian child :
“Upon the wall itself are a few curious
epitaphs, in memoriams of bird and beast,
not necessarily favorite pets ; for childhood’s
impartial tender-heartedness prompts more
ceremonial burials in the case of those
animals who have not in life been under the
children’s special supervision.” But the
doings and sayings of these typical Austra-
lian youngsters are brightly and wittily
told ; and it might be worth the author’s
while to try a “ grown-up ” novel.
The Australaise
I With reference to the competition
for a national “ Australaise, ” which
closes on October 31, it is worth
noting that “The National Commit-
tee,” of Sydney, publish a series of
post-cards containing alleged national
songs. They are poor stuff, and the
Committee is desirous of publishing
broadcast the winning Marseillaise of
our competition as Australia’s national
song. The samples supplied by the
National Committee run on these
lines :
Though poets have lauded the land of the
vine,
And sung of the far-distant country where
shine
The brilliant North Lights on the bright
frozen sea,
There is no land on earth like Australia
for me.
Etc.
M.T.O’M.
Which is mere flam, nicely expressed.
And singing with a patriot voice won’t do
Australia much good anyway, while it is
worth while pointing out that the Cross
(which “ Gilrooney ” has never seen, or he
would not place it in the Milky Way) is the
common property of South America, South
Africa and Australia.
No : the Australaise—the battle song of
the Commonwealth—must be better than
these.
♦
Louis Becke, now in Australia, on a
mission to secure phonographic and written
records of the folk songs of the Pacific for
various Geographical and Anthropological
Societies, advises Australasian writers to
send short stories and sketches direct to the
editors of London newspapers. The Daily
Telegraph, Morning Post , Leader , Stand-
ard, and Nation are keen to acquire
Australasian stories—especially The Nation
(Henrietta-street, Covent Garden, London).
In Paris, the editor of Le Matin spoke
enthusiastically to Becke of what he read in
antipodean publications.
Which is piffle.
We are the standard-bearers—we lift the shining
Cross,
Borne by our stalwart fathers who spurned the
gods of dross.
We lift the star-set banner—the toilers’ flag of
old—
Eureka’s holy standard that Ealor first unrolled.
We lift it high, O brothers, against the shams
that are;
And ye with us must march to-day to save Aus-
tralia !
GRANT HERVEY.
Which rimes like a tom-cat on the roof.
When our Unified Australia meets the Nations of
the Earth,
What great and glorious triumphs shall be ours !—
When she casts aside the futile and the things of
little worth,
And attains her rightful place amongst the /
Powers. .. .
Oh, Australia’s ears are listening, and her eyes
are all a-strain
For the signal that will start her on the track,
Ambition—hewed to Greatness, and to Glory, and
to Gain—
The path on which she never will look back !
Aye, one flag for loved Australia, and one hand
to guide her past
The wastes where bones of older nations lie ;
Be Australians first and ever, be Australians to
the last—
For Australia, if she needs you, dare to die !
E. SMITH.
Which is better, but merely prose.
Aye, ours is a land of transcend ant worth, and the
cross in the purple sky
Shall yet gleam down on an Eden-earth, where
the flags of a Nation fly ;
Aye, ours is a land of the Great and Good (and
_ ablaze in the Milky Way
Swings the shining symbol of Nationhood en-
shrined in a star array).
Oh ! our hearts as a single heart rejoice—for our
souls have shed their dross—
And ’tis grand to sing with a patriot voice for
the Land of the Starry Cross !
GILROONEY.

Thirtv-one years have elapsed since Mrs. Ann
Griffiths, of No. 2 Garden Avenue, Glebe, came
to this country from Shropshire, and five years
since the experiences contained in this report were
encountered. “ I could hardly crawl along,” Mrs.
Griffiths went on to explain to our representative.
“I was so terribly weak, and the whole of my
physical misfortunes arose through bad digestion,
so it is a more important matter than most people
think. For months previously, I had been right
off my food, and I was kept back by the fact that
I was unable to get my rest. Then I discovered
what a dreadful thing it is to have nerves that are
unhinged, for mine certainly were. Why, if a
person spoke to me at all unexpectedly, I would
almost jump out of my skin, and if I happened to
be walking along the street I would be in con-
tinual fear of being run over. Good gracious ! how
I used to start if anything dropped on the floor;
but this was not the worst feature of my nervous
breakdown. I was for ever dreading something
that I knew not what. Somebody was going to
die, or be injured, or a fire was going to take place,
and I couldn’t get these ideas out of my head, no
matter how I tried. In bed at night I would find
myself fairly shaking, with perspiration breaking
out upon me, and I would be afraid to move. I
was full of trouble and felt as if I were gradually
sinking into my grave. A suffocating sensation
in my chest, acute aches down my back, a vile
taste in my mouth, and a tongue white with fur—
those were some of the symptoms that showed I
was not in good health, but the falling-off in my
weight was more eloquent testimony still.”
“ What weight were you prior to your illness?”
“ Fourteen stone —a big weight for a woman—
but I got down considerably. Indeed you wouldn’t
have known me, I was so pale and thin, and it
wasn’t because I didn’t try to get well, Heaven
knows ; for I tried all manner of things without
any good resulting. I suffered most unmercifully
from headaches and giddy feelings, and was aw-
fully despondent at not getting relief from the
physics I had taken. I used to wonder what to try
next, and presently I struck the buying some

Clements Tonic. Well, I could not have expected
so much as I realised from that medicine, though
from what I knew of that remed\’ beforehand, it
is a wonder I did not use it earlier, only the pre-
vious experience was in an entirely'different case,
about which I’ll tell you. In my case, though.
Clements Tonic was wonderful. It strengthened
me throughout and cured my indigestion, even
when all else failed. But its effect on my son
may reasonably be regarded as one of the wonders
of the age. When a child, he received a great
shock, which gave him St. Vitus’ dance. He was
treated at the hospital, and took no end of medi-
cine. Poor chap ! he was almost demented, and
hardly able to walk. It was pitiful to see him
quivering in every nerve, hardly able to drag one
leg after the other, with fearfully hideous nights
m front of him always—no sleep very often,'and
when there was, dreams that made him call out —
a poor appetite and weak digestion; really no-
thing but a shattered wreck that would bring
tears to one’s eyes almost to look at. And he was
like that for years, with never a hope of being
cured, as the doctors could do nothing for him, yet
Clements Tonic set him up and made him so
active, and as sound as any man in Sydney.
People marvelled to see him cured, and anyone
about here will corroborate what I have said.”
“They can see your statements in print?”
“ The whole world should know what Clements
Tonic can do for suffering humanity, and I am
only delighted to be able to tell you what that
remedy has done for me and mine. And you can
form an idea of what a mother’s gratitude should
be, and is, when she has had her son transformed
from a tottering, quivering cripple to a lithe-limb-
ed, sound and robust man. Yes, publish this
news throughout the land in any manner you
desire.”

That dawns for thee and all thy kind for aye,
So that ye rest in Freedom’s shining frondnge”—

What waste is in this world of Beauty tender;
If we but well divined the yearning true
Of hearts that throb (as roses throb for dew)
For some sweet word that breathes of Passion’s

If we but rightly knew !
If we could catch—if we could only hear

For sounds that lift above our turmoil mortal—

The Hell of Red Blood.
Curst with the curse of curses
Because our blood was red—
High souls and empty purses—
We lived, we loved, we bled.
Each cold, grey morning found us
The slaves of some dull care,
Each eve the chains that bound us
Were links of golden hair.
Our chorus shook the rafter,
What time the night was deep,
Red wine and ready laughter
Put all the stars to sleep ;
We won what honor paid us,
We lost what shame denied,
Ours was the pride that made us
The foes to chasten pride.
We died by steel of traitor,
We fell by sword and flame,
Strong arms of some strong hater
Bore down our crest with shame ;
Ours was the flying arrow,
Ours was the rending fall,
From life’s steep path and narrow
We heard the swift death call.
And some are famed in story,
And some are shamed in song—
Be honor ours or glory,
Our days are dull and long.
They make us sing at morning,
They read us prayers at noon ;
We languish in the scorning
Of sun and wind and moon.
We lift our snuffling chorus,
The golden rafters quake ;
We clasp our hands before us,
Our haloed heads we shake ;
We whine with true devotion,
But psalm and prayer are vain
To rouse the old emotion
That fired the throbbing brain.
Because of many boastings,
Because our hands were red,
Not unto us the roastings
That sear the lesser dead.
But they who scorn our scorning
For ever know full well
At eve and noon and morning
Ours is the lowest hell.

A Business Proposal.
(To Eva.)
The Wall-street man is hard to beat;
He’s up to every trick and wile.
And oft he “ corners ” wool or wheat,
And sometimes makes a goodly pile.
I covet not his golden hoard.
His loud attire, his jargon strange —
I’d rather sit upon the Board
Of Daniel Cupid’s Stock Exchange.
If on that Board I ever get,
I’ll really struggle good and hard
To scoop and gather in my net
All “ preference shares” in your regard.
To every trick I will resort,
And practise all the Wall-street wiles
To sell your other lovers “short ”
And make a “corner ” in your smiles.
Of Cupid’s stock I hold, my dear,
Enough though “bears” may growl and
grump— ,
To trade on “ margins ” for a year,
And never fear that love might “slump.”
Oh ! could we but “combine,” sweet maid.
And “ pool our stock.” and form a “ trust,”
Ah ! then we need not feel afraid
Though Cupid’s Bank itself should bust.
In fact, should Cupid bankrupt be,
And have to pawn his wings and bow,
It would be up to you and me
To take the little god in tow.
With wealth like ours, in such event,
It would become our duty plain
To lend him some at three per cent. —
And put him on his legs again.

The Multiplying and Vanishing Billiard Ball Trick.
Unique Billiard Ball.
F
By far the best and most effective billiard
ball trick ever invented. This is a superior
method to any other billiard ball trick ever
yet performed. The pecularity of it is that
the balls can be given for examination as
they are produced, to show they are solid.
The performer having turned up his sleeve*
and shown his hands empty, gives a minia-
ture billiard ball, about one inch in diame-
ter, for examination. The audience being
satisfied, he takes it in his left hand and
passing his right hand over it shows two.
Again a mystic pass, and there are three,
which he shows are quite solid. The audi-
ence now see, to their astonishmet, four
balls. These gradually vanish one after the
other, fill there is only one left, which is
again passed round for examination. An
adequate description cannot be given of this
most delightful effect. If is one of the
prettiest little sleights seen for a long time.
The billiard ball set is made in “ ivorine,”
and can be made in any size. The illustra-
tion will give our customers some idea of
the effect that can be obtainc.' aith this complete set. The sleeves are turned
back whilst performing- this trick the whole time, the hands shown empty, and
at any minute, whilst the trick is being performed, the halls can he passed for
inspection.
This trick requires no sleight of hand, and can be performed hy any person.
The balls can be made to multiply or vanish at the will of the operator.

A GENEROUS OFFER TO THE
COMMONWEALTH.
It is now nearly two weeks since the House of
Representatives selected, in a vague sort of way,
the so-called Yass-Canberra place for the Austra-
lian capital site, and so far the gr«at joy and
satisfaction which the people of N.S.W. were to
show at this “ recognition of their just claims,” to
use the daily-paperese language, hasn’t made it-
self conspicuously visible. It was the steady-
going fable of two or three anti-Australian papers
that the Cornstalk community would never, never,
never at all, put up with a Federal city beside
the great Snowy River, yet in all the four years
that these papers vociferated that narrative they
couldn’t raise one public meeting of even 20
people to seriously protest against the site which
the Australian Parliament had selected. If they
had been shouting in the ear of a dead horse
there could hardly have been a more grievous
scarcity of reply. Then the House of Re-
presentatives was beguiled into selecting a
new site in the locality which the S. M.
Herald and Sydney Telegraph declared
N.S.W. to be craving for, and these papers rose
to announce that the legitimate aspirations of the
State had at last been recognised, and that the
community felt a glow of satisfaction in the
stomach or thereabouts. And yet it was the
same old crying in the ear of the dead horse. All
the shouts of the Herald and Telegraph couldn’t
persuade a single individual to hang out a penny
flag to show that he was feeling extra good about
the selection of Yassberra. The two papers
failed to even beguile their tame correspondent to
write a letter to the editor saying that a great
victory had been achieved, and probably they felt
too much ashamed to write to themselves on the
subject, and pretend to be their own enthusiastic cor-
respondent, and to sign themselves “J. Smith.”
It is a rather sorrowful business all round.
* * W *
The Yassberra site has still to argue its
case with the Senate. It was a curious political
swindle from the beginning, and that may not
help the case. “ Yass-Canberra ” sounds, in a large,
vague fashion, like a fairly generous area of land
stretching from Yass to Canberra, and if the area
represented a square it would imply a decent
amount of elbow room. The area covered, theo-
retically, three, if not four, suggested sites, and
scooped in the supporters of the lot, as against the
advocates of the JDalgety site, who were only one
crowd of supporters instead of three or four. And
the new movement was helped along by the assur-
ance of State Premier Wade that if a site were
selected in that district he would urge the N.S.W.
State Legislature to be really generous in the
matter of a grant of land. There was a yearning
to see what Wade looked like when he was
generous. But it already begins to appear that
the promised generosity is a sham, and that the
Yassberra site, if Premier Wade can manage
it, will be a mere speck of land which will have
no relation at all to Yass on one side and which
won’t get within cannon shot of Canberra on the
other. In fact, according to latest appearances, it
might almost as well have been called the Brisbane-
Adelaide site for all the meaning that its name
conveys. The House of Representatives has
now to select a dwelling-place inside the
Yassberra area, and when that is fixed upon
it is quite possible that the selection will be
carried by fewer votes than those which were cast
for the rejected Dalgety. After that the Senate
will have a chance to consider the matter on plain
business principles. It won’t be voting in a large,
vague way for an undefined province which may
mean anything or nothing, but for some definite
place within that uncertain and hazy area—
possibly for Lake George which, standing alone,
couldn’t raise one vote at the ballot; or for
Canberra which, on its own merits, attracted a
single vote; or for Yass, which wasn’t even
nominated. By the time the matter comes before
the Senate it is to be reasonably expected that
the Yassberra crowd will have been forced to
explain what its site really means, and then it
will only attract the supporters of one locality,
instead of the friends of three or four. And, of
course, there is the chance that its opponents may
propose, by way of alternative, and as an adapta-
tion of the same political swindle, a Bombala-
Albury site, and scoop in the supporters of Bom-
bala, Dalgety, Tumut, and Albury in one great
act, and thus upset the Yassberra apple cart.
* * ■* *
Meanwhile the exact value of the assurance that
the N.S.W. State Legislature would act gener-
ously by the Commonwealth, if a Federal territory
were selected somewhere near Canberra, begins to
come to the surface. It was an indefinite sort of
bribe at the best, and now, if any reliance can be
placed on the anti-Australian papers which
speak for State Premier Wade, it is only
likely to liquidate for about 2d. in the £. What
is spoken of at present is a Federal territory of
between 100 and 200 square miles, with a right of
way for a railway to Jervis Bay, and a scrap
of water frontage there, enough for a wharf
or something like that. The water supply of
the capital of Australia, according to the theories
of Premier Wade, is to be under State control,
and Australia is still to take the jug round to
Wade’s back door when it wants a drink. There
is talk of forming a Water Trust to supervise the
catchment area and see that it is kept clean and
respectable, but the Water Trust will be created
by the N.S.W. State Government, and will be
under the State Government’s orders. Of course,
if the catchment area of the Australian capital is
so guarded that the city will have a clean water
supply, and not one which will be a constant
source of typhoid and pestilence, the area will
have to be kept practically clear of population,
also of cows, horses, pigs and such like. And,
that being so, it will be of hardly any real use or
value to N.S.W., and N.S.W. might as
well hand it over to the Commonwealth,
unless Gregory Wade wants to keep it for
the joy of being in a position to threaten
the Federal city with the loss of its water unless
the Australian Government is sufficiently sub-
servient to him and his kind. There are only two
reasons why the N.S.W. Government can want to
retain control of the water catchment area of the
Federal city. One is that it means to settle popu-
lation on that area and make profit out of it, and
consequently force the Australian capital to put
up with a polluted water supply, which will make
it a plague spot. The other is that, while it
intends to keep the catchment area clean and let
the Australian capital have a fairly decent water
supply—which means that the water catchment
area will be of practically no cas'-> ’•"’••a to the
State—it still insists on retninimr possession of the
area, so that it may show its power and iti petty
importance, and keep the Australian captd in a
condition of dependence and servitude, an 1 play
the part of the bully in the boys’ bcardiug-s .'hool—
the little tyrant whose dignity has to tie recognised,
else there will be trouble. If there is any other
possible explanation, it is up to Mr. Wade to
state clearly what it is.
♦ * * -K
Sydney has an average rainfall of 49 inches per
annum, yet though it is a mere State capital it
requires 500 square miles of country as a catch-
ment area, and it is constantly taking in a bit
more on the ground that the supply is insufficient.
Yass averages only 25 inches of rain, so the Federal
city, which, being the capital of a whole continent,
should some day be much larger than Sydney,
would probably require a great deal more than
500 square miles for the collection of water. That
is apart from the space required for the city itself
and its suburbs; and just here it may be men-
tioned, as a side issue, that Melbourne and its
suburbs occupy, for mere buildings and streets,
about 255 square miles, or more than the area that
the amazing Wade proposes to grant for the Aus-
tralian capital, and its suburbs, and its water
catchment area, and its outlet for drainage, and
for any other necessary purposes. If the area
offered was 1000 square miles it would still
be miserably insufficient; even 5000 square
miles would be none too great. And 1000
square miles would be less than one three-
hundredth part of N.S.W.; also 5000 square miles
would be only one-sixtieth part of N.S.W. ; so the
State would no more notice the loss than Wade
would notice the loss of a drop of perspiration.
And that sixtieth of the State would mostly re-
present a bit of country that N.S.W. isn’t using,
and never has used to any extent; and it would
include a harbor which N.S.W. has left, after 120
years, just about as blank and empty and deserted
as it was when the aborigines were in sole posses-
sion of the land. Down on Monaro the N.S.W.
State Government allows one monopolist to
retain, as an empty desert of grass, about
three times the area which it alleges that it is
willing to offer to Australia for its metropolis,
whereby it may be fairly assumed that the present
N.S.W. Government loves the great land-grabber a
great deal more than it loves Australia. In fact,
its hatred of Australia, and its desire to degrade
Australia, and hold it up to the world’s contempt
as a mean place whicli can do with any kind of a
hovel as its political centre, seems to amount to a
disease.
• m * *
In pursuance of this line of conduct, the inspired
Wade press of Sydney speaks with a fine, large
toleration about the proposal to have a Federal
port at Jervis Bay, with a line of railway to con-
nect it with the capital. Its attitude is something
as follows :
(1) That railways and ports are unnecessary evils, and
that the desire to supply Australia with a new seaport, or
any seaport at all, is a sort of fad to be endured with a
pitying smile.
(2) That the railway will never pay in any case, the
Australian capital being naturally a mere village, and of
no importance.
(3) That though the proposed capital is 50 or 60 miles
nearer in a beedine to Jervis Bay than to Sydney, still
Sydney is its “ natural outlet,” and the idea of a port at
Jervis Bay is therefore mere superfluity. (The Wade
crowd, however, holds that Sydney is the natural outlet
of every place. Only the other day the amazing Wade
declared it was the nearest port to the Northern Terri-
tory and consequently the natural outlet of that country
also.)
(4) That their own (and Wade’s) incessant demands for
absolute State control of the Australian capital’s water
supply, and all its means of communication with the outer
world, are such solid evidence that they couldn’t dream
of making a bad use of the power in question that the
demand for a Federal port, so that the capital will have
some access of its own to the outer world, is a matter for
mild derision.
(5) Nevertheless, and by way of mollifying a harmless
Federal lunatic, the Wade press is prepared to recom-
mend “ generous treatment.” Said generous treatment
to consist in a grant to the Commonwealth of a bit of
land equal to about half the area of Brisbane and its
suburbs, with a railway line to Jervis Bay and room for a
wharf there. This being the attitude of the Wade party
in one of its generous moods, one naturally wonders
what it is like when it is feeling really mean.
Still, even if the Mean Colonial party carries
its point now, the matter will not be within miles
of final settlement. The capital question will
simply become a standing source of agitation and
irritation, like the tariff, or Sydney’s North Shore
bridge. It may start according to Wade’s small,
shabby methods, but it won’t continue on those
lines for ever. The natural desire to live in its
own house, to have its own tank, and to have
control of its own incomings and outgoings will,
in the end, burst up all the proposed paltry little
restrictions. If the Federal city is planted at
Yassberra it is almost as certain as next day’s
sunrise that it will some day own Barren Jack
reservoir and the streams that supply it, also the
whole port of Jervis Bay with the intervening
land. It will get tired of going humbly and re-
spectfully to Wade’s tank for a drink, and a
day will come when it will belt Wade on
the head hard with the jug. At present
no one in the Federal city cares a straw
what restrictions the Wade push imposes, for the
simple reason that there is no one there at present
and the city hasn’t arrived. By-and-bye, how-
ever, there will be a population there, and a press,
and a corporate authority, and then there will be
someone to organise revolt against the petty
tyranny which proposes to make the capital the
only town in Australia which has to respectfully
ask a semi-hostile outside authority for a drink.
The enlargement may come by a long process of
agitation and recrimination ; there may be years
and years of bitter needless row, like the tariff
row, and the row over the division of the Federal
revenue, and the other protracted and sordid
rows. Or it may come suddenly. The Federal
Government may be driven by the irritating
restrictions and limitations put upon it to make
Unification and Reconstruction a front feature
of its policy, and during the Unification
period, before the Reconstruction starts, the
Australian Parliament may take what land
it pleases. Or the restrictions may become so
galling that a dozen years hence an agitation may
be in full blast for the abandonment of the
cramped premises, and the shifting of the whole
show out of N.S.W., and into more commo-
dious quarters. Nothing that Wade can do in
the Way of trying to pen Australia’s metropolis in
a hen coop can be of permanent effect ; the
struggle to make the capital a mean city can only
result in years of worry, agitation and anger, and
the final discomfiture of the mean city party. The
so-called settlement of the question on mean city
principles won’t be any settlement; it will be
rather the beginning of a fight than the ending of
ohe.
THE AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE SCHEME
AND ITS CRITICS.
So far as the debates on the Australian Defence
scheme have gone, the Opposition has proved
itself a curiously futile and unsatisfactory crowd.
Its members have said the obvious thing, and
jeered the obvious jeer, and thrown the obvious
clod, but anybody could do that. The keynote of
their diatribes has been a silly contempt for the
small beginnings of things, as if there wasn’t a
small beginning to everything, and as if there
could be any achievement without a beginning.
They are a wholly destructive crowd of critics ; of
the capacity to create things they have shown not
a semblance. Most conspicuous among their wild,
loose queries has been the demand to know
what possible value Prime Minister De akin’s
little preliminary squadron is likely to have
against the sort of fleet an enemy may
bring against it. To that query any fool could
reply that in its preliminary state it will
probably have no value at all. The maritime
resources of any one of the present naval Powers
of the Pacific —the United States, Japan or
Chili —could wipe it off the face of the
waters in a half-day’s scrimmage, or less.
And it is equally true that when England started
to build its first navy the fleets of the Danes or
Norwegians, or of the Greek empire, or even of
the young republic of Venice could have extin-
guished the English navy in a day, and if those
early Englishmen had been built of the same poor
material as certain of the Australian Opposition-
ists there would never have been any British navy
at all. Also, it is a fact that within the memory
of men still living the navy of the German em-
pire was a collection of obsolete hulks which the
Turkish sea-forces of that day could have sunk at
short notice; and within the same period the
Japanese navy was such a mere jest that Holland
or Denmark could have eaten it before breakfast.
Unfortunately it is the creed of the political
degenerates that Australia can never grow, and
that if the beginnings of its defence are small
they must remain small for all time. The same
gang which says that the Australian capital can
never be more than a mere country town naturally
holds that the Australian sea defence can never
be more than an old raft with an aged cannon on
it. So the degenerates scoff with the scoff of
those who regard their own country as always in
the wrong, and ask loftily what the proposition is
all about.
A great deal is made by the opponents of de-
fence of the fact that war vessels rapidly become
obsolete, so that to spend money on warships is
to spend it on something whicli will be quite dead
10 or 20 years hence, and must then be written off
as a bad debt and replaced at great expense. The
statement is true, and it is equally true of build-
ings, passenger steamers, and many other things.
It even applies to Willy Kelly’s clothes and
Bruce Smith’s heavenly hat. Britain’s fleet also
becomes obsolete and has to be constantly re-
placed at great cost, and if the British Parliament
was as foolish and illogical as the Australian
Opposition party, it would, for that reason, have no
navy at all. Then the first brown man who hap-
pened this way would annex Australia, and when
the smoke of battle and the riot of annexation
had cleared away, George Reid might be dis-
covered as a slushy, washing up dishes in a brown
gentleman’s kitchen, with his barrister’s wig for a
dishcloth. Australia in this matter has a choice
of three propositions : (1)1 It may maintain a fleet
of its own, which fleet will always be growing
obsolete, and have to be constantly renewed at
great expense; or (2) it may pay a cash subscrip-
tion towards a British navy, which is constantly
becoming obsolete, and which has always to be
renewed ; or (3) it may do the pauper act, and
neither maintain ships of its own nor pay anything
towards Britain’s naval expenses, but simply
depend gratis on a fleet which is constantly be-
coming obsolete, and which has to be perpetually
renewed. Whichever way the matter is looked
at, the plea that Australia should have no fleet
because beets wear out is a fool of a plea, and not
worth any sane man’s consideration.
Further, certain Foreign-traders and other
Tories have risen to great heights of declamation
about the alleged meanness of stopping the naval
subsidy of £200,000 per annum, it might have
been thought that so painful a subject were better
buried out of sight. The British navy costs over
£31,000,000 a year, all subscribed by ttie42.000,000
people of the British isles. Also, the people of
the British isles find the ships, the men, the
officers, the fighting capacity and the experience.
If Australia did, in proportion to its population,
as Britain does, it would put up £3,000,000 a year,
and also find 46 war vessels, 12,900 men and
inferior officers, 80 captains, nine admirals, a heap
of naval knowledge and information, sundry
dockyards for building ships, and various
oddments. The £200,000 subsidy implies
one of two things: it may be that we
are putting up only one-fifteenth of the
actual cost of the sea-defence we get, and
putting up none of the ships, officers, naval
capacity, etc., and in that case the swindle that is
being played on poor old Ma is something too
dreadful for words. Or it may fie that in putting
up a subsidy of £200,000 a year we are paying for
all the marine defence we are likely to get in
time of need ; which means that we are doing
with one-tifteentli of the naval defence per in-
habitant which Britain regards as necessary ; and
in that case the reckless folly of the situation
passes expression. Either way the £200,000 naval
subsidy can’t be stopped too soon. It is such an
unpleasant business that everybody ought to feel
ashamed to have its carcase about the premises.
* * * *
And there have been other weird critics and
criticisms. Wild-eyed persons got up, for in-
stance, and asked what enemy the proposed Aus-
tralian land and sea forces were intended to meet.
Any fool can ask that sort of question, but now
that the prophets are dead even a very wise man
can’t answer it. It may astonish that kind of
critic to learn that Britain itself doesn’t know
what enemy its great navy is intended to meet —
though it reckons that if it sold its navy it would
very soon find out. The British navy was built
first as a defence against the Danes. Later it was
regarded as security against the Norwegians ;
then, successively, as a safeguard against the Nor-
mans, the French, the Spaniards, the Hollanders,
the French again, the Americans, and now it is
commonly regarded as security against the Ger-
mans. In between times it staved off the Portu-
guese, the Turks, the Bailee rovers, and sundries.
Australia doesn’t know against whom its fleet
will operate when it gets one, but it does know :
(1) that the empire needs a fleet; (2) that it is
periodically called upon to operate against some-
body ; and (3) that if Australia, now that it is
grown to something like man's estate, doesn’t
do its share towards supplying that fleet, the rest
of the empire may get the tired feeling some day
and leave it in the lurch. In such a case Canada
might get out of the difficulty by handing itself
over as a job lot to the big, well-armed, adjacent
United States ; but we are an isolated community
with no such methods to fall back upon. And the
withdrawal from the Pacific of all save a few weak
and inferior British vessels is a broad hint to this
isolated community that it is time it did something
for itself.
* * * *
Also there are more and still more critics. An
amazing fat person named Reid almost wept at
the wickedness of calling upon young men of 18
to go in',for military training, seeing that they have
no votes and therefore can’t defend themselves at
the polling booth ; and almost in the same breath
he urged the compulsory training of school-kids
of the ages of 12 and upwards, though they
also have no votes, and are quite unable to defend
themselves. Great excitement and clamor were
created by the discovery that certain districts of
Australia will be exempt from the compulsory
training law—for the sufficient reason that in
these places young men are so scarce and so many
scores of miles apart that, at present, it wouldn’t
be worth while to hunt for them. If that is a
reason why there should be no compulsory military
training, it is also a reason why there should be no
compulsory education, for there are still hundreds
of children growing up in blank ignorance because
they are so thinly scattered over vast areas that
only a flying teacher could run them dowu.
There has also been much lamentation be-
cause the Governments Defence scnemo is


“imperfect,” and it certainly is—-much more
imperfect and half-hearted than it need be.
Yet it is worth remembering, as a set-off,
that almost everything is imperfect at first.
There was a time when Sydney was mostly one or
two tents and a gallows; and when Melbourne
was a single hut and some kangaroos ; and when
Jos. Cook was a sticky infant, and W. H. Irvine
a small, toothless character howling for pap.
Then, by way of a new departure, the usually
level-headed Melbourne Age quotes the example
of the Boers as showing that “ huge and highly-
trained armies of invasion may be effectively com-
bated by native defenders comparatively few in
numbers,” etc., which would be very comforting if
Australia, like the Transvaal, were an inland
State, with all its cities 250 miles away from the
sea, instead of being an island with almost its
entire population dumped down on the coast.
But, as matters stand, the Boer example is poor
consolation.
* * * *
And the last and maddest critic of all is the
individual who sees darkly, as one gazing through
the bottom of a bottle, that the whole proposition
of Australian defence is a scheme to sever the
connection with the British Empire. He holds
that Australia shouldn’t have a gun, lest it may
get wild some day and shoot Old Mother with the
weapon. It is a beautiful theory, but if Wales
and Ireland and the Scotch Highlands (which
are all conquered countries) weren’t allowed to
supply soldiers to the British army, lest those
soldiers should use their military knowledge
against the Emp ; re later on ; and the Indian army
were disbanded iest it should one day “ cut the
painter” ; and all the miscellaneous nigger troops
which have been raised here and therein Britain’s
innumerable dependencies were turned adrift
for fear they might declare the liberation
of Ashantee, or raise the red republi-
can banner in Egypt or Sierra Leone, it
would be a rather cold day for England.
The spectacle of Poor Old Mother, staggering
along with all the weapons of the Empire on her
shoulders because she couldn’t trust anybody
would be a pathetic business. The anti-Aus-
tralian party that professes to see, in the near
future, a time when the Australian fleet may lick
the British navy at sea and declare the throne of
Edward YII. vacant hereabouts becomes painfully
ridiculous. Taken in the mass, the opponents of the
Deakin Government’s Defence policy seem to be
divided into three classes: (1) Mean men, who
don’t want to pay their share of the bill, and who
disguise their feelings by whooping for allegedly
“loyal ” reasons in favor of the £200,000 naval sub-
sidy because it only runs to Is. per inhabitant per
annum ; (2) cowardly individuals, who think that,
when Australia undertakes a fair share of its own
defence instead of paying a trifle towards the
maintenance of an extraneous fleet, their own
skins maybe in danger; and (3) tired persons who
hate the trouble and responsibility of managing
our own defences. All these people are of small
account, and it is a grievous pity that, in the
attempt to conciliate them, the Defence scheme
should have been pared down to its present un-
satisfactory dimensions.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Is Jervis Bay a Confidence Trick?
Already some of these misguided people who
speak in haste and give away the show are making
unpleasant statements about the Yassberra
Federal Capital site recently selected by the
House of Representatives. To begin with, George
Reid made this statement: —
I do not think we would have been able to get a
majority for Yass-Oanberra had access to Jervis Bay not
been taken into consideration.
That is a very plain statement of the case.
Jervis Bay and the great Barren Jack
reservoir were two baits that were most indus-
triously held out to buy the votes of fools and
others for the Yassberra site, though the N.S.W.
State Government doesn’t mean to give up Barren
Jack, nor does it intend to surrender Jervis Bay—
in fact, Wade’s inspired press organ now hints
about giving the Australian Government only
room for a wharf there, or something like that.
And now, on top of this, Joseph Carruthers,
the N.S.W. ex-Premier who snatched the wire-
netting, and the man who invented Canberra,
alleges that Jervis Bay, in its connection with
Yassberra, is only a swindle and a gold-brick, and
a confidence-trick after all. Says Joseph :
The seaport for Yass and Canberra and Queanbeyan is
Sydney. B teman’s Bay is sometimes used as a port for
wool from Braidwood and Lower Monaro, but Jervis Bay
never is used ; practically IT IS CUT OFF BY A HUGE
AND PRECIPITOUS VALLEY—THAT OF THE CLYDE
RIVER.
So Joseph Carrdthers, who is the inventor of
Canberra, and ought to know, implies that the
whooping about Jervis Bay, as one of the special
advantages of the site, was a mere getting of votes
under false pretences, and that Jervis Bay is only
accessible on the map, and not in reality. This sug-
gests the necessity for some very earnest exploration
before the matter goes any further. But even if
Jervis Bay is accessible from Yassberra, and
assuming that Wade doesn’t strike his old anti-
Australian attitude and make a mockery of the
business by offering a few hundred feet of water
frontage," so as to make commerce practically
impossible and (by reason of the lack of commerce)
the railway to the Federal capital a mere bad
debt, there is another aspect of the case. Ac-
cording to the Constitution, “the seat of Govern-
ment of the Commonwealth” must be at least 100
miles from Sydney. Jervis Bay is only 87 miles
from Sydney, and there are very great doubts if
the Commonwealth can possess it. If the
“seat of Government” means the exact spot on
which Parliament House stands, it can ; if the
term covers, in a general way, the bit of ground
which the Commonwealth uses for purposes of
government, then it can’t. Everything depends
on the view that the High Court takes of the
matter when the question is legally raised, and if
the Yassberra site is adopted on the strength of
its sea access at Jervis Bay, the trouble may not
happen along till the capital is built and the rail-
way from it to Jervis Bay constructed—provided
that, despite J. Carruthers’ statements, such a
railway is possible. Then, when a million or two
has been spent on the Australian capital and on a
railway, some casual Anti-Federalist may apply to
the High Court and get the whole Jervis Bay busi-
ness nullified, and the so-called Federal port may
become N.S.W. State territory again. Whether
this possibility was, or was not, in view all the
time that Jervis Bay was being pointed out as
one of the great advantages of a Yassberra capital,
and whether the alleged inaccessibility of Jervis
Bay from Yassberra (vide Carruthers) was also
in view all the time—in other words, whether the
scheme was all swindle, confidence dodge, and gold-
brick —it is impossible to say. But when it is
legally impossible for the seat of Government to
be within 100 miles of Sydney, it is folly to take
chances, and have the “seat” sticking 13 miles
inside tbe legal limit, especially when a good
Federal port can be found a few miles further
south without taking any risks.

A Wail from Canberra.
Dear Bulletin, —From the fate of Ananias and
his good lady, may the Lord deliver allCanberra-
ites ! That is tbe pious aspiration of one who has
followed the capital-site manoeuvrings throughout,
and has known the whole of the Yass-Canberra
country, its rivers and its creeks, for the past 60
years. I have always considered that the first
two essentials for health and comfort in a city
were pure water and good drainage. Neither
of these can ever be ensured in the
site that has been chosen for the capital
of Australia. Tumut is the only site in
Southern N.S.W., besides Dalgety and Bombala,
that can command a constant supply of good pure
water. My father took up country at Canberra
in 1834. I have often heard him talk of the years
’39 and ’4O, when the Murrumbidgee stopped
running entirely, and became as dry as the sur-
rounding plains. The Queanbeyan River and Cotter
Creek gaveout long before the’Bidgeedid, and they
stayed out for months after the bigger stream
started trickling once more. In my own experi-
ence, I have known the Queanbeyan to be a mere
indication of where dampness had been. I have
camped in the bed of the Cotter, and I have
stepped across the Murrumbidgee dry foot time
and again in an ordinary drought season. Ihe
latter has not a sufficient flow during the
average drought to give a city like Goul-
burn drinking water for one day a week.
The little water that does flow from the ’Bidgee
and Cotter in wet times is not pure water. The
whole catchment area of the Murrumbidgee, after
it leaves the mountains back of Cooma, is heavily
stocked. Not only the droppings, but the decom-
posed remains of thousands of dead beasts and
sheep—particularly after a dry season—are swept
into it. If that water is dammed, it may serve
for irrigation ; but God help the people who drink
it. Tumut could have got a good water supply
from the Snowy mountains, and though the rich
fiats between Tumut town and the foothills are
thickly settled at present, they might have been
resumed at a moderate figure as there are but 30
miles or so of them. But Tumut is hot and
oppressive in the summer, and has no drainage
outlet. Both Dalgety and Bombala possess an
unlimited supply of pure snow water. They
have the benefit of the Snowy Mountain catch-
ment area. There are but two human habitations
between the Dalgety site and Jindabyne, at the
foot of Kosciusko. There is little or no stock in
the district to pollute the water supply. And
from either Dalgety or Bombala the sewerage
could have been treated by septic tanks and
then discharged into the Snowy, lower down,
and carried to the sea, as there is no one
living on the river banks or using its water for
a hundred miles down. As to land, there is more
worthless soil about the Canberra site than in the
whole Monaro district. On the eastern side of
Canberra I know, by bitter experience, that there
are thousands of acres that would not carry half a
sheep to a hundred acres. Australia’s best hope
at present is that the Senate will reverse the de-
cision of the House of Representatives, in regard
to the Federal capital site. As one who has had
several decades’ acquaintance both with Canberra
and the Monaro territory, I regard the present
selection as in the nature of a national tragedy. •
Yours, etc., J. E. Wright.

A Hot Time at Broken Hill.
Broken Hill is on the edge of a serious trouble ;
and, though it drew back a step during the early
hours of this week, it is still in great danger.
Two years ago an agreement under the old Arbi-
tration Act was fixed up between miners and
mine-owners, and was made to run until the end of
1908. While this compact was current the mine-
workers had troubles of their own. The Socialism-
in-our-time section got command of the unions,
and that led to a break-away and the formation of
what is called the Non-political Union, which has
grown to something over 1000 strong. This union
registered under the new Industrial Disputes Act;
the old unions refused to have anything to do
with that Act. As the old agreement got
towards the end of its life, a move was made
to fix up a new one. The Non-politicals
proposed to the old unions that they should jointly
confer with the mine-managers. The old unions
replied to the effect that it regarded the other
union as a blackleg crowd, and wouldn’t be seen
in its company. So, instead of one conference,
two conferences were arranged. As soon as that
was announced, the old unions passed the mana-
gers the word that, if they met the Non-politicals,
there would be a strike straight away. There
were two or three ways of avoiding that most
desperate and unsatisfactory of all methods; but
the old unions, instead of calling in men like
Cann, their senior M.L.A. the practical
miner who has been representing them in the
Assembly for 17 years—went to Melbourne, and
hired the calamitous and utterly un-practical
Tom Mann to be their temporary guide, phi-
losopher and friend. That, of course, meant wild,
whirling language instead of sober negotia-
tion. Even assuming that the Non-political
Association should never have been formed, but
should have remained part of the old body, it
adopted the proper course when it proposed that,
for this occasion, it should practically go back to
the old union fold, and join forces with the old
unions ; and the old unions took a huge
responsibility when they refused that proposal.
Were the two lots united the men might
successfully resist any attempt to reduce
wages and rates of pay; and that, after all,
is the thing the men and their families
are most concerned about. The Broken Hill
workman, the underground miner especially, has
to do hard and dangerous work under conditions
that are in many respects vile, and even at recent
rates he was paid none too well. No combination
of which the men are capable can be too
strong to resist any attempt to cut down the pay ;
and the greedy section of the owners must chuckle
with glee at the spectacle of the divided forces
against them.
An Exhibition of N.S.W. Manufactures.
Since the beginnings of Federation N.S.W. has
made great strides as a manufacturing State in
fact, its progress has been so great that it has been
decided to hold an exhibition of N.S.W. manufac-
tures in the Exhibition Building, Prince Alfred
Park, Sydney, from November 14 to November
21, and thus let the Sydney people get some idea
as to what they are really capable of. And if
Sydney goes to this exhibition, and provided it is
a representative affair, the city will have fairly
good cause for astonishment. It will find that it
is able to make almost everything, and to make
it.of good quality, and also to make it at quite as
low a price as the importer charges. In N.S.W.
manufactures were worth, in 1906 (no later com-
plete statistics are available), £12,083,000. That
is to say, they were worth nearly twice
as much as agriculture, and as much as
agriculture and dairying put together. And
even that isn’t a fair statement of the real
value of the State’s manufactures. In estimating
the worth of the output of factories the Statis-
tician deducts the value of the raw material from
the value of the finished product, and the
£12,083,000 above quoted is merely the difference
between these two items. On the same basis the
value of the agricultural output should be reckoned
as the value of the crop, less the cost of seed,
fertilisers, water for irrigation purposes, ground
rent (land being the farmer’s raw material) and
sundries, but this isn’t done. Agriculture is
credited with the price of its gross output; manu-
factures only with the net worth of its production.
If the value of N.S.W. manufactures was esti-
mated on the same basis as that of agriculture it
would now stand at some £25,000,000 or £30,000,000
a year, and appear worth more than the pastoral
and agricultural industries put together, further,
it isn’t a semi-parasitic industry like agriculture.
It hasn’t to be boosted up with cheap adult
labor, unpaid and enslaved child labor, railway
rates so low that they mean absolute charity,
grants for seed wheat, grants for roads, and mis-
cellaneous subsidies to ease its local rates. Re-
garded as honest industries which pay their way
and are taxed in addition to give a leg-up to agri-
culture, N.S.W. manufactures call for apprecia-
tion and encouragement, and they get mighty
little of either. In the first place, the importer
is against them. Thanks to a long course of semi-
Freetrade, the importer has grown to be very rich
and numerous, and arrogant in N.S.W. He often
represents sweated artisan labor in the place he
imports his goods from, and he always represents
sweated clerk labor at this end. With so much
cheap labor, he is able to pay more for advertising
than any other class in the community, and the
big daily papers wouldn’t offend him for worlds.
The importer loathes local manufactures as the
Devil does holy water, for the result of local manu-
facturing is always the same in the end —the
manufacturer begins to deal direct with the retail
shopkeeper, and the importer loses hisuseless, loaf-
ing, and highly profitable job. Therefore there is
very little in the way of lying and slander and
perversion that he and the papers which work for
him won’t do to destroy Australian industry, and
among them they have brought into existence a
mentally-diseased class, which professes to
shudder at the idea of wearing or using anything
that isn’t imported. This class is found and
pandered to mostly in the localities where the
commercial community hangs out. For instance,
the writer lives in Strathfield, and daily passes a
small shop where boots are repaired, and the sign
above it says that it is the “Anglo-American”
dep&t, and the slab of leather in the window is
always marked “English.” Of course, this
“Anglo-American” concern doesn’t send the
boots to London or New York to be half-soled,
but in a place like Strathfield, where the traders
and Foreign-traders congregate, it would pro-
bably pay better for a shop to fall down dead than
call itself a plain Australian bootery. Owing to this
diseased frame of mind, N S.W.’s manufacturing
industries have to progress by stealth. They make
the Parisian costume which is sworn to as im-
ported, and the Paris hat which is a lie, and the
boots which are sold as American, and hun-
dreds of other things which have to_ forswear
their birthplace even as Peter denied his Master.
For years and years, in at least one big Sydney
establishment, the gorgeous brass-mounted bed-
stead was made locally and sworn to as
“imported,” and the shoddy bedstead was
imported and called “ colonial,” and that is only a
sample of what goes on in many branches of
industry. The exhibition of N.S.W. manufac-
tures is the sign of a revolt against this degrading
servitude. The N.S.W. manufacturers mean to
show what they really can do, and if “Anglo-
American ” boot-repairing shops and places of
that kind don’t like it, they will have to conceal
their feelings as best they are able.
o
The Budget that G. Reid Attacks.
Treasurer Ltne’s Commonwealth Budget, on
which the desperate Reid has based a motion of
no confidence, or censure, or something equally
hopeless, probably annoyed the Yes-No person
because it was so plain and straightforward—
there was a former occasion on which a financial
statement made by plain, straightforward George
Turner had just the same effect. At the moment
of writing, Reid hasn’t indicated what his com-
plaint against the Government and its Treasurer
is : it may be that the Commonwealth has handed
over too much money to the States; it may be
that it has handed over too little. Probably G.
Reid hasn’t decided which it is yet. Quite likely
he will argue that the Government is unfit to hold
office because last year it handed over £330,613
more than the statutory three-fourths, and
thereby starved Commonwealth services to
that extent; and then, having argued that
way, it is just as likely he will vote with
the petty State Frighters in trying'to oust the
Government on the ground that it ought to have
handed over a great deal more than £330,613.
Really, the one point of interest, the one new
feature, the one declaration of policy, in the
Treasurer’s Budget was the announcement that
for the current year the States “ need not expect
to get twopence more than their three-fourths.”
Hitherto, including the £330,613 extra which they
got last year, they have had, from first to last,
£6,058,962 more than the Bradoon clause pro-
vided, with the result that Commonwealth services
have been impaired in all directions. In one
department alone, the Post Office, there is such
an accumulation of arrears that the Department’s
chief expert officer says nothing short of £2,000,000
will bring it up to reasonable efficiency. It ought
to be plain enough to any average person that the
postponement of works hitherto makes it all the
more necessary to carry out works now, and that
the fact tint the States in this way got amazing
surpluses in the past makes it the less possible
for them to get any surpluses at all in the future.
Yet stupid State Frighters say that, because the
States have had big surpluses hitherto, therefore
it is unjust and ruinous and various other things
to discontinue the big surpluses. In other words,
the State Frights argument is that, if you have a
certain job to do, and dawdle in the morning,
you’ve got to make up for the morning dawdle by
dawdling also in the afternoon. The Common-
wealth dawdled in the morning ; but only an ass
would say that it has now got to make up for it by
doing the same thing at the present stage of the
proceedings. If it did it would inevitably miss
the ’bus. Even if Treasurer Lyne’s estimate of
revenue is greatly exceeded (he sets it at
£14,577,271, or £438,527 less than was actually
received in 1907-8), there will be plenty to do
with the extra money. On Defence, for instance,
it is proposed to spend during the year only
£1,102,681; and last year’s appropriation (ex-
clusive of the £250,000 which was paid into a trust
account as a Navy Fund nest-egg) was £1,244,857.
It is true that that £1,244,857 was not all spent;
with this Department, as with most of the others,
many of the votes lapsed. In the Postal Depart-
ment last year £524,(59!) was voted for new works,
but only £426,289 was spent. And over that
matter, by the way, there is at least the possibility
of a nice little bit of sharp dealing. The
Commonwealth has no Works Department of its
own; so the State Public Works Departments
carry out the jobs for the Postal and other
Commonwealth Departments. Now, if the money
voted by the Commonwealth Parliament is not
spent, and the vote lapses, the surplus goes to the
States; so the States have a direct interest in
securing the lapse of the votes by postponing
works which they have undertaken to look
after on behalf of the Commonwealth. It
might be impossible to prove that such works
have been deliberately hung up; yet there is
the fact that, while works have been badly
needed and the money for them has been voted,
they have not been carried out, and upon the
consequent lapse of the vote at the end of the year
the money has fallen into the State Treasuries.
In the Cause of Morality—Bent!
The impudent hypocrisy of Adolphus Bent is at
zenith when he gets among the snuffiehusters.
T’other Monday night he found himself at a
Methodist Church concert in a Melbourne suburb,
where he was desired to talk. Whilst the limp
brethren and sistern hung upon his utterances
Bent gammoned them as follows :
He rejoiced at the spread of religion and morality in
the district. The Government had done its best to help
in this class of work. Think of their Gaming Act! In
this connection he was often asked why he did not bring
in a Totalisator Bill in order to assist the charities. He
had always said “ No,” and he repeated that answer again
that night. He thought the totalisator would do-more
harm than the money received from it would be likely to do
good. The Gaming" Act had undoubtedly been beneficial.
If his Ministry never did anything else it would deserve
a niche in the temple of Fame for that one measure.
It cannot be too often remarked that Bent’s
Gaming Act, forced upon him by public opinion
rather than by the clamor of Judkins and Co.,
Avas calculated to cause a reaction against the
“ moral reform ” it professed to have in view. The
same Bent who says “No” to reasonable de-
mands for a legalised racecourse totalisator, was
scandalously tardy in suppressing the private
Collingwood Tote which caused all the trouble.
Me was dragged this way and that by the voci-
A Song of Compulsion.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Listen, camerados!
Stretch wide the portals of your ears, and hear
Atlendez, s'il vous plait !
I desire to draw, compel and rivet your attention
to a Solid, Unavoidable Fact ;
The proportions of this Fact are Immense —
Roughly, three million square and mainly alien-
ated miles:
The Name of this Fact is Australia —
The Land !
Large, prominent, unavoidable as it is, there be
those who cannot perceive it,
But we, you and I, camerados , are not of those.
This large, prominent and unavoidable Land
a large, prominent and Unavoidable Task-
before it—
A Colossal Job —to do !
So far, the Job is hardly planned, or compre-
hended,
But, as the Lord liveth, it is going to be done, or
we, you and I, camerados, are undone !
And our country will be in the Soup !
Remember, this is a song of Compulsion
Of Confiscation —
Of incandescent Revolution —and incidentally of
absolute Recognition of the Situation.
Were you all, camerados, of one equal mind, the
Job would be begun to-day ;
As it is, we shall probably begin it To-morrow ;
The Day After Will Be One Day Too Late!
Let us, therefore, substitute certainly for probably.
Thus: “We shall certainly begin Australia's
Colossal Job To-morrow.”
Paste that in your hats, camerados!
Sing it! Write it! Quote it! Teach it in all the
schools, and burn it into the minds of the
unheeding—
Engrave upon your axes the words—
“ The Land Barons Must Go 1 ”
That is the burthen of the song we must sing :
The land must be opened, and right soon —
We ask a Leader, camerados: a Big Man with Big
Ideas—
And a Big Axe—
A Red-Hot confiscatory and compulsory Land
Policy.
The Fools and the Imbeciles—also the Fats—will
cry—
“ Capital will leave the Country ! ’
Let it !
We can get more capital out of our own land in
ten years than we can import in a hundred
years ;
Moreover, while foreign capital must be paid for
by yearly interest —
And, still, at the end of one hundred years will be
owing by you, and me, and the fools and
imbeciles, camerados —
The local capital, like the land, will not go out of
the country.
The Fools and Imbeciles and Fats will also cry—
“ The value of Land will Slump ! ”
Let it Slump !
We can then arrive at a fair, as against a fic-
titious, price for land.
The Fools and Imbeciles and Fats (especially the
Fats) will moan—
“ But Confiscation is Immoral ! ”
It may be—or, again, it may not be ; a lot depends
on circumstances.
Still, better be immoral and free, than moral and
dead !—or slaves !
Again, they will howl “ Robbery ! ”
Let them Howl !
Who are the real robbers—the People, defrauded,
or the Fats and Land Barons who are robbing
AUSTRALIA of her National Destiny?
We intend to take back what should never have
been parted with.
Is not Australia’s Safety—
Is not Australia’s Prosperity—
Is not Australia’s Nationhood worth something?
The Sphinx of Destiny is asking you the Question.
If you do not or cannot answer it, the Sphinx will
eat you !
What are you going to do about it, camerados l
Confiscation or Damnation ?
Choose !

terous Judkins forces on the one hand and the
influences of the illegal Tote on the other, and it
was not till he heard the public shouting dis-
gustedly with Judkins that he brought in a
Graining Act loaded with irritating clauses. If
its purpose was to turn public feeling against the
snufflebusters, and give an appearance of some-
thing like respectability to the lawless Tote and
Club that it suppressed, Bent’s Gaming Act was
about the most artful piece of legislation he has
achieved. The public wanted no more than the abo-
lition of a notoriously mischievous gambling busi-
ness. Bent practically said to the public, “Since
you compel me to amend the old Gaming Act, I
will make you sorry you coerced me.” He put the
brand of illegality on various harmless forms of
dissipation, and in so doing he seemed to suggest
that what was sauce for John Wren should be
sauce also for the churches which had been wont
to introduce lucrative gambling machines into
their charity bazaars. With the Methodists,
whose rabid antipathy to all such money-raising
devices is the essential hypocrisy of their creed,
the bluff of Adolphus Bent passes unchallenged.
But to an audience of discriminating citizens he
wouldn’t dare assert that an Act which placed
everyday gambling shops on the same level as
occasional church bazaars was intended to assist
religion and morality.
Smith.
The rather dull career of the Women’s Anti-
Socialist Conference, which has lately been ex-
hibiting its new hat and its antiquated ideas in
Sydney, was relieved last week by the wild,
hilarious tale of an alleged woman named Smith.
The yarn was that Mrs. Smith— who was the wife
of a working man; but the Anti-Socialist
female condescends even to the wives of working-
men—called on Treasurer Lyne with Miss Gracie
Watson, the Anti-Sosh lady who told the yarn, and
that Lyne developed a rude, unpleasant habit of
addressing the lady as just “Smith.” Of course,
he shouldn’t have done it, and the incident
tended to show the coarse, ignorant, overbearing
character of democratic politicians who don’t be-
long to the Anti-Sosh league. Australia heard this
quaint Smith story, and laughed a good deal. It
reckoned it could have invented a better story
even if it had been dead. In the first place, when
anyone is devising a yarn or a slander in
a hurry and wants a name for an imaginary
character, it is ten to one the imaginary
character is called Smith. Smith is the first name
that comes to hand. Even the French detective
in the musical comedy, when he disguises, himself
for detecting purposes as an English peer, with a
check suit that looks like two black condemned
cells painted on a white surface, instinctively calls
himself “ Sir Lor’ Mayor Smith.” A fabricator
of more experience, however, resists the first in-
stinctive tendency to call his heroine Smith, and
darkly labels her Jones. The first-class inventor
would get away from all these common names and
call her Drinkwater, or he would say her name
was Ferguson, and that William Lyne insisted
on calling her “Fergy.” So Australia laughed
wildly at the Smith episode and the crudeness
thereof. Lyne is a courteous old warrior, a
parliamentarian of vast experience, a fisher-
man after votes who never needlessly throws away
a supporter or a possible supporter. This
Smith kind of tale, when told of Oom
Bill, had all the finish and probability
of the small girl’s narrative about how she met
Edward VII. in the street, wearing his crown
and coronation robes and eating jam out of a tin.
It sounded like a child’s tale, devised for children.
And Sydney, at all events, if not the rest of Aus-
tralia, gave up taking the Anti-Sosh ladies
seriously after last Federal election. It heard so
many weird anecdotes about how they canvassed
for votes for the G. Reid faction, with earnest
assurances that if the Deakin-Watson crowd got
into office confiscation would start immediately,
and even the kitchen furniture would be seized
and taken away, that it ceased to have any faith
in any Anti-Sosh lady. Rightly or wrongly, it set
the whole class down as having been born without
a capacity for truth or a glimmering sense of
ordinary fairness —as something abnormal and not
to be judged by ordinary standards—and let
things go at that. ' So when the people who
had met various Anti-Sosh ladies at election
time heard about the Smith joke, they just classed
it with the marriage-tie joke, and said it wasn’t
up to much as a literary effort. And when Uncle
Bill Lyne telegraphed demanding the name and
address of “Mrs. Smith,” and the date of the
alleged happening, the comm unity wasn’t surprised
that he seemed to make very little progress in the
way of collecting details. The yarn was repeated,
but “Mrs. Smith” remained as undefinable as
ever. And by all appearances she is likely to
continue so.
♦
A Letter and a Motion of Censure.
“Henry Horsecollar,” on an unaccountable
motion of censure :
The motion of censure which Geokge Reid announced,
last week, in the House of Representatives upset many
calculations. It purports to be directed at the new
financial proposals of the Deakin Government, but these
proposals are so harmless and ordinary-looking that it
isn’t easy to see that much can be made of them. Of
course, it is always possible to say that the proposed
Defence expenditure and Old-Age Pension expenditure
and Post and Telegraph expenditure are too large, or not
large enough, or anything like that; but there is nogreat
dust or excitement to be raised over statements like these.
■Meanwhile the Federal capital question is hung up again.
The Senate had a motion on its business paper to select a
time for taking its Federal capital ballot, and if Reid had
postponed his motion for a day, the date of the ballot
Would have been fixed, and thing's would at least
have been moving. Instead he rushed in at exactly
the unexpected moment, and, owing to the bad old
tradition that no work can be done while a censure
motion is pending, the Senate dispersed without even
deciding to consider the capital question at all. It
doesn’t meet again till October 28. Last session the
Foreign-traders discussed the capital at almost intermin-
able length in the House of Representatives, and then,
when a settlement seemed in sight, Webster turned up
with his vote of censure re the Post Office, and the capital
was lost in the confusion. This year the Foreign-traders
discoursed almost interminably about the capital, and
when a settlement seemed in sight Reid and his motion
of censure re the finances get in the way. The Bill which
was to have been introduced to give effect to the resolu-
tion in favor of a Yassberra capital is dropped for the
time being, and how long the delay will last depends on
the panning-out of events. About the best that Reid
could hope for when he devised his censure motion was
that parties might be so evenly divided that
there would be a crisis and a dissolution and
a new election, and what would happen to' the
Yassberra Federal Capital party at a new election no man
knows. Possibly the always-surprising Reid really
aims at the upsetting of the Yassberra choice, and has
got a new and hitherto-unheard-of Federal capital hidden
up his sleeve or concealed down his back. That strange
craving to be “ top dog,” which he has expounded before,
might make him crave to produce a capital site
that was entirely his own, and the fact that he
voted for Yassberra need make no difference to
h' m —he supported almost all the provisions of the
first Federal Constitution in the Convention, and
then denounced it wholesale and retail on the platform.
Meanwhile, the other half of the Tory party is bitterly
angry. Negotiations were in progress for a union between
the Reid-Oook Tories and the Forrest-Knox-Irvine Tories,
and it was agreed that Reid and Cook were to step down
and that there was to be a new election of leaders, at
which, of course, Reid and Cook would both be eligible.
The anger of the Forrest-Knox-Irvink Tories when Reid
suddenly re-asserted his position as leader and challenged
the Government without consulting anybody was a great
emotion. The theory of the Forrest-Knox-Irvine people
seems to be that things were looking bad, and that Reid
thought he Couldn’t make them any worse. In the same
way a man who is troubled with debts, religious doubts
and a cantankerous mother-in-law might set fire to his
house on the general principle that something might
turn up during the conflagration. This habit of dropping
a bag of gunpowder down the chimney on general prin-
ciples is curiously characteristic of G. Reid. On the other
hand, it is curiously characteristic of him that he should
have deep reasons for dropping the bag down the chimney
—reasons so deep and complicated that nobody has
guessed them, and) possibly so deep that Reid hasn’t
guessed them himself yet.
A correspondent writes on “ Morality which is
allied to Madness” :
C. G. Wade’s new proposals for discouraging the “ un-
fortunates” of N.S.W. are as futile as they are merciless
-which is saying a good deal. Wade’s idea, as set out in
his Police Offences (Amendment) Bill, of dealing with the
solicitation offence is to have the soliciting party hunted
about the city by the police till an opportunity arises for
hustling her into gaol. She breaks the law if she lives in
a house of her own, and whoever houses her becomes a
party to her guilt. The same sort of thing was tried on
the continent of Europe before the registration regime
came in. It proved an utter failure. There are
in operation outside the Commonwealth two
ways of handling the evil which Wade abhors :
(1) Registration such as exists in France, Germany, etc. ;
(2) complete license, which is the English way. Under
the registration arrangement the outcast woman has a
home. If she breaks the police regulations by pervading
the streets, and is rounded up by a patrol, it is her own
hearse. She can claim no sympathy from any quarter
when she gets the harsh treatment she has thus earned.
As a result she rarely offends in this way. And so the
streets of cities like Paris, Rouen, Marseilles, etc.,
are (for all the much-discussed looseness of the
French) the most orderly conceivable. Quite respect-
able citizens may v/alk through them at all hours
of the night and never suffer a qualm. And the
community benefits in other and obvious ways. London
affords an example of the opposite extreme. The
Briton’s passion for closing his eyes to the existence of
anything that is not strictly proper results in the
followers of the oldest profession being left quite alone by
the authorities. The whole of the West End quarter of
London teems daily, from e*rly afternoon till early morn-
ing, with ladies of palpable frailty. All the world east of
Brompton Road and west of the Law Courts is their
oyster from the moment the lamps are lit. The Police
Offences Bill islikely, if it passes unaltered, to produce in the
big N.S.W. towns some of the worst features of London and
Paris life by night, and none of their good ones. The
measure shies off “pandering” to vice, and so does
nothing to mitigate the real damage ; and it promises
to encourage the brutal callousness that has come
to be the custom amongst the police of continental
Europe when dealing with street women. One of the
troubles connected with all so-called “ reform ” Adminis-
trations is that they are dominated by a section which is
incapable of distinguishing between vice and crime. Just
as thes 1 folk would cheerfully hang a youth on the word
of a hysterical and lying young woman for a “ serious
offence ” of which he was not guilty, so they yearn to see
the frail woman put in the same legal category as Billi
Sikes. Wade’s proposals go the limit in the matter of
harshness. Sikes, at the worst, may have a place to rest
his head ; and he is not chivvied unceasingly by the police
when he walks abroad in search of a likely crib. A
couple of appalling effects of the acceptance by the
N.S.W. Parliament of the portions of the Police Offences
Bill referred to above will be (1) to establish the
precedent that an evil which the law has regarded
hitherto in much the same light as drink, gambling, etc.,
is an indictable offence ; (2) to drive all the women who
live by it to the resorts of criminals (since no others will
harbor them), and hence to a life of habitual crime. And,
moreover, the experience of centuries has shown that the
evil which is assailed won’t be abated by such measures
one iota. For the gratification of a few"morality cranks
the atrocity hardly seems worth while.
+
One of the most rational provisions in N.S.W.
Premier Wade’s Police Offences (Amendment)
Bill is that dealing with opium-fiends. It is pro-
posed to make the smoker or eater of opium liable
to punishment as well as the person who smuggles
or sells the drug, or runs a den for its consump-
tion. Holman, M.L.A., had this weird objection
to raise to the above (15/10/’08): —
A man of mature years who has formed the opium
habit is an object of pity rather than of punishment. A
victim of the habit should not be made a victim of the
brutality of the law.
If it is granted that the opium habit is a curse to
the community, the proposed measure for sup-
pressing it is justified straight away. There
are a score of social evils that are in-
eradicable. Opium-consuming is not one of
these. It is a forced and unnatural growth, as
it were, in the way of social evils ; and it is not by
any means widely spread so far. The “ victim of
the habit ” who is called upon to leave it off has
no particular claim on anyone’s sympathy. He is
not faced with a hopeless task. De Quincky
dropped opium-eating of his own free will several
times—mainly to prove to himself that the thing
was possible. And any time during the hundred
years that have intervened since then white men
have been doing the same the world oyer. Ninety-
eight per cent, of opium-consumers in N.S.W. at
the present time are Chinese. They represent
a class which is prepared to take any
risk for the drug which represents celes-
tial bliss to them. They and their agents
have instituted locally a regular system of opium
smuggling, and as a result the authorities allege
that as much of the drug gets into the Common-
wealth to-day as at any time before legislation
was passed excluding it. There is no doubt that
the only means of checking the opium habit is to
put consumers on the same level before the law as
vendors. To talk of “brutality” in connection
with shutting down on the revels of an opium-
fiend is as foolishly maudlin as to talk of brutality
in connection with the forcible detention of drink
maniacs. One of the first effects of legislation
making the opium smoker and eater equally liable
with the opium-seller is likely to be the denuding
of this part of the world of a number of its most
degraded and insanitary Chows—for the opium-
,consuming Chow absolutely refuses to abide where
opportunities for enjoying opium are not. Which
in itself goes a long way towards justifying the
measure.
The N.S.W. land law is to have another
Amending Act dumped on top of the tangled
mass. The original Land Acts arranged for
the disposal of State lands by conditional pur-
chase or conditional purchase lease. Succeeding
legislation sought to get rid of the land said to be
unsuitable for O.P. or C.P.L. by a bewildering
series of leases, and vast areas of land have been
acquired as homestead selections, homestead leases,
inferior leases, leases under Section 32, leases
under Part VII., settlement leases, improvement
leases, scrub leases, special leases, new special
leases, additional leases and Heaven only knows
what other sort of leases. The new Bill authorises
the cocky, under certain conditions, to exchange
his particular sort of lease for some other sort, and
to swap almost any sort of lease for a freehold.
And apparently the Treasurer will be allowed to
collar the proceeds of the proposed “conversions,”
and thus add a bit more fake to his already
heavily-faked surplus. The fact evidently is.
there is so little good land left in the State’s
hands that straight-out land sales are becoming
difficult; also some people object to further land
sales, anyhow. Therefore the Government booms
the business by a side-wind ; and it sells land
without calling the thing a sale. But the land it
really is selling is land that it has been drawing
rent from ; and once the land is freehold there
will be no more rent. The future Treasurer, who
won’t have either purchase-money or rent to play
with, will wonder what sort of shiftless, feckless
fools the Treasurers of the past were. And the
taxpayers of those days will also wonder to the
same effect.
“HSdiie” writes: —
You pay an undeserved compliment to Wade in attri-
buting to him the “model” N.S.W. Local Government
Act (B. 24/9/’08). He had no more to do with the passing
of that splendid measure than the man in the moon. The
main credit for the present shape of the Act—a shape
Which makes it the shortest, clearest and most sensibly
socialistic of statutes in any British statute hook—belongs
to Coghlan, now Agent-General. Wise has some credit
for advancing it one stage. And then the credit for
passing it belongs to Joseph Oarrutiiers, whose tenacity
and knowledge of detail and sympathy with its aims,
forced it through the reluctant Houses. It was an un-
popular measure in Parliament and not too popular in
the country. But it was a vital necessity. Others who
are to be credited in connection with this unequalled piece
of statutory democracy are John Hughes, who passed it
through the Upper House (he had been a bit of a pioneer in
local government legislation before this time), and lastly
John Garlick, an obscure State official, who has carried out
the difficult work of starting the wheels going round,
while all the old aldermanic bats looked out of the dark-
ness of their town halls and hooted at him. Now as to
the Act having “ struck a snag.” Every great measure
requires amendment after its first working, as a crank
shaft or a valve in a magnificent piece of machinery,
which turns the wheels of a hundred mills, may have a
latent flaw. Even the Federal Constitution is not flawless.
Besides, in the Newcastle assessment cases, a common-
sense reading of the sections would have justified quite a
different judgment. I an) inclined to think that the
N.S. W. Supreme Court would have made as short work of
acting-District. Court Judge’s law as the High Court made
of a similar point a little while ago, sweeping away the
cobwebs of technicality with the broom of common-sense.
We must remember that the influence of the High Court
has brought a little common-sense into alt the State
Supreme Courts, and they are inclined to kick technicality
whenever its head is visible. Acting-Judge-made law
(and District-Court-made law at that) has not yet come
under the influence of the new spirit, and, consequently,
the law will have to be amended as an easier remedy
than costly appeals to reverse dunder-headed decisions.
In my opinion—and I have studied the question in many
countries—the Local Government Act of 1906 is the
finest democratic instrument passed into law up to date.
If you want to realise what a useful implement of prac-
tical Democracy the Act Can be made, look at sections
109 and 110. Wade the author of the L.G. Act! That
commonplace politician ! Why, he doesn’t even under-
stand what it means, and has himself already trans-
gressed the canons of the Act by begging on the door-
mats of other departments for doles for local works for
his own constituency, and solemnly defended his action
in Parliament on the ground that when others were
scrambling for subsidies, he (the Premier) was also a
man and a brother, i.e., a local member, and had to get
his share of the doles—same as the small fry. I believe
that the influence of the Act has already, in a large
measure, transformed the erstwhile helpless incompet-
ence of an “ Ask-the-Government-in-Sydney-for-Every-
thing” people into an energetic, independent, self-
reliant community, showing the beginnings of a civic
pride which will yet be a great national asset.

This letter comes from a well-informed source in
Melbourne:—
Just when it was most essential to the interests of the
Labor party in Victoria that its representatives should
command all the confidence which the community has
withdrawn from Bent, the choice of a Labor candidate for
Carlton has fallen upon Bob Solly, through the influence
of his old patron, John Wren. Among steady-going
workers who deplored the one-time notorious in-
fusion of WREN-ism into Labor politics, there is a
desire to get quit of any faint odor of defunct
Collingwood tote that still" clings to the party. An
unexceptionable nominee for the Carlton seat was Nor-
man McLeod, editor of the Labor Call, and if a ballot of
the local party could be taken he would get the selection.
•Unfortunately, the question as between McLeod, Solly
and a dozen other nominations was left to theP.L.C., and
.Wren’s agent and former club manager, one Lawrence,
had great influence in the maitter. The 300 odd voters
who took part in a ballot at- the Melbourne Old Trades
Hall included, it is said, the members of a two-up school.
With their valuable assistance, Wren’s own particular
friend Solly was selected to go to the poll
in Labor’s cause, and when he comes out on
top, as he probably will, the grateful Bob will
have another conspicuous opportunity to compare Wren
to Napoleon Bonaparte. Not content with putting his
own jockey on the Labor horse, Wren has entered his
own solicitor, David Gaunson, for the forthcoming event.
Gadnson, running ostensibly in the Liberal interest,
should help to ensure the victory of Solly’s mount.
Which is as it should be— i.e., the victory of a Labor
hominee. But the intervention of Wren is what should
not have been, and if the P.L.C. was responsible for it the
character of that organisation needs reforming altogether
—— ■* ■
That misfortunate little Freetrade League, which
was formed some weeks ago in Svdnfey at a meet-
ing of about 23 persons (many of them hostile)
and some umbrellas, arid which then disappeared
from public view, has bobbed up again. At least
a person connected with it—one W. Stace-Lloyd
—has issued a circular at Ashfield wherein he
stated that “Freetrade is pre-eminently a Labor
question,” and that the Federal tariff has reduced
the purchasing power of wages by 25 per cent. It
is a pity, if Freetrade is pre-eminently a Labor
question, that Stace-Lloyd doesn’t carry his
gospel to Balmain or some other suburb
where he can address Labor direct on its own
verandah. Ashfield is, the sort of place that never
weeps over the wrongs of Labor except when it is
trying to grind its own tomahawk. And as for the
alleged reduced purchasing power of the workman’s
wages by reason of the tariff, the working classes
had £10,900,000 in the N.S.W. Savings Banks in
1901, the last year of alleged Freetrade, and they had
£15,300,000 there in 1907. These savings represent
the difference between what the workers earn and
what it costs them to live, and seeing that tliev
accumulated £4,300,000 in six years of Protection*
against £10,900,000 in 68 years of alleged Free-
trade, they don’t want any bogus sympathy from
Ashfield. In fact, they are liable to fancy that
Ashfield is weeping from ulterior motives.

The revival of “ Sunday,” at Sydney
Royal, affords Tittell Brune a tine chance
of exploiting her unchanging comedy methods.
As a maiden of the Wild West dra-
matic school, she is in her element. Tittell’s
“Sunday” is extremely arch always. She
passes from grave to gay with dazzling swiftness.
It is her pretty habit to stare for a brief moment
with wide-eyed solemnity at her interlocutor,
irrespective of the turn the conversation is taking.
Then she breaks into a gurgling laugh. After the
laugh she trips up-stage, and a look of worshipping
puzzlement spreads o’er the faces of all present.
She is too complex for them. Anon, with eyes
dancing, she is engaged on some innocent prank
in the neighborhood of the O.P. wings; and a
second later, her sweet face all penitent serious-
ness, she is nestling in the arms of one or other of
the rugged old fellows with metallurgical hearts,
who so adore her. There is no very subtle art in
this sort of thing, but it pleases the romanticists
who go to plays of the “ Sunday ” class.
An effective foil to the hoyden of Silver
Creek is Colonel Brinthorpe, who loves her.
Brinthorpe is in the hands of Thomas Kingston,
a beautiful and stately young colonel. He handles
the English language with an attention to word-
values that is painfully unusual in the case of real-
life swashbucklers. He suggests one who has
gained a commission in a volunteer corps of actors.
“Sunday,’’hercolonel, hergrand old guardians, and
the delightful aunt whom Mrs. Brough pourtrays
with such distinction, are giving way to “Diana
of Dobson’s ” next Saturday night. But they will
return again. There are characters in “Sunday ”
that a sentimental public will not let die yet
awhile.
* *■ * *
“ The Belle of Mayfair ” continues to go
strong and beautifully at Sydney Criterion. Sir
John Chaldicott, the human chestnut shrub,
bourgeons as luxuriantly as though there were no
such thing in this Sosh-cursed community of ours
as penalties for growing japes that have exceeded
the age limit. A personal inspection on Monday
night convinced this paper that such of the chorus
as had been away the previous week attending the
Women’s Conference had resumed the work of
fascination once more, and in a general way things
at the show which Bigwood doesn’t patronise are
booming like the Ma State under Federation.
irC- ttc
Mrs. Percy Plantagenet Bigwood’s Aus-
tralian season is now numbered by days ; and this
Merry Widow begins already to put her weeds
into an express delivery cart, and pile her griefs
into a cabin trunk, en route to the other important
engagements that are awaiting her over the water.
Miss Ohls, who came out with a concert co., will
be the next Sonia. Meantime there is no break in
the popularity of the piece, and Sydney continues
to turn up at Her Majesty’s in house-fulls to see
how naughty the dreadful Maxim’s really is.
“ Two Little Sailor Boys” are still running
hand-in-hand at Sydney Palace. The Admiral is
the same disastrous dodderer as of yore, and his
wife continues to murder the hoarse burglar by
waving a knife at his back and screaming. Also, at
latest accounts, the villain was still being throttled
by having his waistcoat dragged by the hero.
The way that personage treats the villain’s vest
is calculated to cause a tailor acute agony, and
this paper wouldn’t mind betting that, before the
season ends, he will be reported to the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Clothes.

Katharine Goodson can afford to forego
the prefix Miss or Mrs. Katharine the Con-
queror signifies her place on the ivory ladder
of musical fame. Just as Paderewski or Melba
may go unprefixed, so may she. She appeared at
Sydney Town Hall on Saturday night, and it was
a musical rout. She is now trailing at her chariot
wheels the scalps of all those who listened to her
magic music. Although essentially feminine in
her style, she has the usually masculine attribute
of nervous force. The tempestuous Beethoven,
the subtle and romantic Liszt, the passionate
Chopin—the pianiste makes these and the
other composers on her programme sing in
their own various compositions. Acute sensi-
bilities and perfect mechanism are amongst the
baggage of the lady’s artistic outfit. Paderewski
himself did not arouse greater post-melody noise
of appreciation than Katharine Goodson bowed
her dark head before on Saturday night. A
strong orchestra under Slapoffski backed the
pianiste’s work. She will give a matinee to-day
(Thursday), previous to leaving Sydney.

The Stage Society justified its formation
bv a good all-round performance of “A Doll’s
House” at Sydney Palace on Saturday afternoon.
Ibsen’s tense piece of feminine psychology hasn’t
much room for humor; but the character of
Nora has such lights and shades in it that
the much-advertised “gloom” of the hairy
Norwegian Shakspeare did not gloom to
any depressing extent. Mrs. Elsa Buhrow
played this exciting part with wonderful verve.
Of the men, G. Forrest Gilhooley showed an un-
expected dramatic fire, “ Frank Arnold ” played
with restraint as the invalid, Dr. Rank, though
obviously, there was nothing the matter with his
spine; while that capable actor, G. E. Fletcher,
added to his list of successes the quite un-
sympathetic character of the priggish husband of
. the doll. He properly keyed this character low
all the first two acts, to lead up to his explosion in
the third—-and that is, for an amateur, a most
trying thing to do. For Ibsen isn’t dead easy.
The general evenness of the performance was due
to the stage-manager, Sydney T. Price. If the
Stage Society can keep up the level reached in
this first ambitious performance, it will be wel-
comed by the few. people who take the drama
seriously in Sydney.

The object and purpose of the E. M.
Woolley memorial movement, now being ardently
pushed along in Sydney, is the establishment of a
pianoforte scholarship for female students, to be
tenable alternately at the Royal Academy and the
Royal College (London). A large sum has been
raised by subscription, but the excellent concert
given by Slapoffski and his amateur orchestra last
week only added a few pounds to the total. Mrs.
Slap, sang an aria from “ Trovatore ” in splendid
fashion, and revived interest in the old opera.
Also 16 young girls from the Garcia School of
Music warbled melodiously and with the perfect
balance of a sovereign-weighing machine. The
Garcia School aims at big things. Next month it
will hitch its waggon to a star, and perform
Oowen’s cantata “Ruth” in Sydney Town Hall,
Sir
Sydney Tivoli programme contains no sur-
prises this week, though it threatens two new
turns for Saturday. Prof. Duncan’s Educated
Collies and the Three McGregors are the respect-
ive labels of the new amusement goods, and The
Bulletin presumes that the first lot will lark, and
the second do something profoundly Scotch. In
the meanwhile, Abdullah’s Arabs continue to
whirl furiously on their Arabian axis, and Osborn
and Brooks contribute a gay trifle in the shape of
a comedy sketch. Burt Shepard, Ted Kalman,
Tod Lowen, Fanny Powers and Barnard’s Dolls
make up the rest of the firing line. Tod Lowen
farewells on Friday night. Now being the time
of the roses, this paper feels obliged to award a
little praise to the Four Rosebuds for their dancing
and general smartness on the stage. The rest of
the entertainment doesn’t shout for recognition.

“The Red Mill ” is running a strong, bub
strictly limited, season at Adelaide Royal. Ford
and Leslie are a joyous pair, and the whole affair
has the Something Different that the American
touch can impart when the U.S. touch is in good
order and condition. The Geach co. farewelled
with some “ East Lynne,” advertising thus : “ A
souvenir fan will be given to each lady patron. O
dry those Tears ! ” The sentiment was praise-
worthy, but the means suggested quite inade-
quate. The Pavilion has taken to moving pic-
tures again, the market for them being seemingly
unlimited. Fitzgerald’s circus has moved out, and
is modestly doing some turns at the Port. Ade-
laide has been distinctly over-concerted lately, but
the Elder Conservatorium was crammed for a
demonstration by the brilliant University crowd
that Miss Guli Hack teaches. That lady “con-
ducted ” both chorus and orchestra herself. The
leading feature was the wealth of new music, in-
cluding a kind of cantata locally composed by
Bryceson Treherne. And now the Town Hall is
crowded nightly by excited Welshmen—including
Tom Price, the S.A. Premier—to hear their
amazingly-gifted countrymen sing hymn-tunes,
and “Cwsg,” and other soothing melodies. Also,
the Commercial Travellers have frivolled wildly
in a public place for the benefit of several deserv-
ing charities. They played a kind of impromptu
burlesque, and called it “The Giddy Widdy,”
and the rest of their proceedings were built
according to that sample.
** * *
“Zira,” billed for a six-nights’ run at Her
Majesty’s (Melb.), .is plain melodrama of the
better kind, and here, for the first time in that
city, Miss Margaret Anglin is required to put a
good deal of false color or grease paint upon her
character to make it effective. Whereas she fol-
lowed the natural bent of her talent in “The
Thief,” and seemed to clothe the troubled heroine
with her own personality, she cannot hide the
fact that Zira is a stage creation and a creature of
impossible circumstances; Therefore, except for
her burst of violence in the third act, when she
sweeps away the taunts of the other woman with
a torrent of recrimination, Miss Anglin is mostly
out of artistic sympathy with her part. It offers
opportunities for dramatic action which she
doesn’t grasp. Her ordinary method is realistic.
She has no turn for assuming an air of naturalism
in a theatrical manner. She misses the most
stagey points in melodrama, where to try to be
quietly forceful is to be rather dull. Besides Miss
Anglin has little or no personal magnetism.
When she stands still for quite a long time and
talks rapidly in a conversational tone, the
audience is not spellbound. Her delivery of
Katharine’s long honeyed speech in “ The Taming
of the Shrew ” was excellent, hut her utterance of
a yard of common prose lines is not incisive
enough. And because Miss Anglin is an artist
of distinction one notes every little fault in her
performance, whilst ignoring the enormous defects
in the work of commonplace mummers.
“Zira,” presented, as a drama by Hartley
Manners and Henry Miller, is an altered version of
Wilkie Collins’ “The New Magdalene.” The
alterations are in the least important particulars.
Mercy Merrick was an English nurse at the
Franco-German war, and Hester Trent is a nurse
at the Boer war. The period of the play has been
advanced 30 years or so, the happenings remain
practically the same as before. Mercy
Merrick, a penitent with a Past, stole the
identity of Grace Roseberry, even as Hester
Trent purloins the hat and passport of Ruth
Wilding. Mercy came to England as Grace
Roseberry, captivated a young parson at the
house of Grace’s aunt, and was much distressed at
the appearance of the real Grace, whom she
allowed to be shoved aside as a lunatic. Then
Grace had a private interview with Mercy and
told her what she was, and Mercy called Grace a
cold, cruel, respectable young woman, and defied
her to prove her genuineness, but afterwards
owned up to the truth and was taken, weeping, to
the parson’s breast. This is the story of Hester
Trent (Zira) and Ruth Wilding. The moral is
necessarily bad, in order that the name character —
Zira, as she now is ; Mercy Merrick, as she was—
may have all the sympathy of the audience. The
other girl, the victim of the imposture, appears
unpleasant in her respectability, whilst Zira seems
all the more noble on account of her disrespectable
Past. It says much for Miss Anglin’s tempestuous
outbreak in the third act that she “ brings down
the house” without having been vigorously
attacked by the girl (Miss Alma Vaughan), whose
cattishness is Zira’s only excuse for fury. Grace
Roseberry was horribly insulting to Mercy
Merrick when Wilkie Collins supervised
the first production of his dramatised
novel. Likewise when it was staged at Mel-
bourne Princess’s by Miss Janet Achurch, who
cried Mercy to the Grace Roseberry of Miss Maud
Williamson. The virtuously indignant cat put as
much ginger into her share of the controversy as
the cat who was indignant but not virtuous. Now,
Miss Alma Vaughan does nothing in particular to
deserve the antipathy of the audience, neverthe-
less Miss Anglin manages to turn it almost full
against her. .There are other people, notably
Rev. Cordon Clavering (formerly Rev. Julian
Gray) and Surgeon Knowles, who is a considerably
altered character. These are very subordinate, in
interest. They are so palpably gullible. Tither-
adge, as the surgeon, is a disgrace to his learned
profession, for a sane woman tells him a con-
vincing story, and he waves it aside as the fabri-
cation of a mind diseased. Henry Kolker imper-
sonates the parson who rejoices more over the
penitence of the lady sinner than over ninety-nine
mere men who never go to church. On Saturday,
“ Twelfth Night ” comes along to finish up the
season. Miss Anglin will play Viola, and Titlier-
adge will disguise himself in the immortal char-
acter of Malvolio—who once won a Melbourne
Cup.

“Human Nature,” whose two authors,
Pettitt and Harris, have long been gone to that
bourne whence no bellowdramatist returns, is an
old-fashioned entertainment which loomed very
large at Drury Lane of yore, and measured five
acts and 16 scenes when it turned up at Melbourne
King’s Theatre last Saturday night. An army of
supers who formerly marched with the narrative
have mostly died of beer, but. the military element
nowadays makes up in noise and smoke for what
it lacks in numbers. Also the plot has grown
more astounding with age. Geo. Cross, as
the married hero, appears to get ruined
in the first act by a French gentleman,
owing to a flaw in their verbal agreement.
The wicked foreigner is verbally in debt
to Cross for a large amount, but he charges Cross
with the liability, whereupon the defrauded hero
calls him a liar and pays the money. Further-
more the Frenchman professes to rob Miss Dug-
gan of her spotless reputation, after which the
family solicitor steals her cheeild, who falls among
baby-farmers, and is restored to mother by another
Little Vagabond. Fortunately the comic-relief
man frustrates the plans of the solicitor, and the
Arabs are defeated with ridiculous ease by the
British troops. Moreover the lurid adven-
turess of the piece is brought to grief at
last, and the missing proofs come home
to roost. The drama was called “Human
Nature” perhaps because it is as mixed
and various as a sausage. Geo. Cross earns his
salary on active service abroad what time Miss
Duggan and Max Clifton are struggling for posses-
sion of the cheeild in Britain. Miss Ada Guild-
ford is the adventuress once again. Walter Dal-
gleish takes part in the disturbance, and Bert
Bailey puts his comic relief into verse with
terrible success. Edmund Duggan and Miss
Leighford conduct the baby farm, whilst Dunbar
flourishes his belltopper hat with true French
politeness. Maisie Posner appears to advantage
as the pore Little Vagabond, and the 10 scenes de-
serve honorable mention, notwithstanding the
brilliant coloring of the landscapes.

Wirths’ Circus opened at Wirths’ Park
(late Princes Court), Melbourne, on Saturday
night. In addition to the ordinary arena, there
are an oval and the stage of the lately-erected
theatre, the last used for wild animal and other
turns. The new scheme gives an effect of large-
ness and variety to the tented interior, but it has
defects. For example, when three turns are
shoved on to the arena, oval, and stage at once,;
the attention of the spectator has to work over-
time, and is apt to get choleric. Again, the stage,
which is let in at the back of the tent, is.
distant enough from a big body of onlookers to
discount the spectacular effect of the happenings
thereon. As for the performance, it is good,
although some of the riding exhibitions are in the
nature of aged and tried friends. An unusual item
is Wirth’s £lOOO giraffe, whose neck is so long that
he has to he fed from a balloon. From basement
to fourth floor the giraffe is a sight more elegant
than a cow ; above the snow line he is frigid
and delicate ; while, at the pinnacle, a mile or two
above sea-level, he gets tremendously interesting.
But he isn’t the whole show. The Gammon
Bros., from Madrid and elsewhere, career through
an excellent head-and-hand-balancing turn,
assisted by a dawg. One of the Sidney Bros,
turns a complete somersault in the air upon a
bicycle. Les Crottons, who appear in gladiatorial
furnishings, have an exceptional muscular de-
velopment that loses a little in imposingness on
the comparatively distant stage. In the depart-
ment of flexibility, Miss May Martin and Mr.
Sampei Osado have some notions to expound, while
the Rodriques Bros, give some rather surprising
trapeze and head-balancing exhibitions. The
clowning is marked by moderation and a wise sense
of its unimportance, though the vacuities of Bebe
and Pastore are certainly justified by their gro-
tesque Frenchinessand an enormous feeding-bottle.
Numerous equine acts introduce the Christies,
the Welby Cookes, and Miss Stella Martin. Ele-
phantics are supplied by six of the immense, bland
quadrupeds, wandering through their cultured
evolutions with expressions of dreamy benignity.
But the other wild animal turns, especially the
second last on the programme, seem to drag over-
much.

Last nights—and not many of them —are
announced at Melhourne Princess’s and Royal.
“The Morals of Marcus” will finish its three
weeks at the Princess’s on Friday, and on Satur-
day, for the first time in Melbourne, the character
of Simple Simon will be discussed. Herbert
Flemming makes his re-appearance in “Simple
Simon.” When he has occurred for seven per-
formances, including a Wednesday matinee, he
will gather together his company and fittings and
tour along to another city.

“ The Bohemian Girl ” (Gorbless her !)
was to push “ Maritana” off the Royal hoards on
Wednesday of this week. If nothing has hap-
pened to prevent her revival, the Girl is already
dreaming of marble halls, also her long-lost father
is getting his heart bowed down. They will
repeat their ancient ballads until Friday of next
week, after which comes the Dramatic Co. with
“ She Stoops to Conquer.”

Ada Crossley sang her first Melbourne
song on Thursday, to a house that tumbled over
itself to welcome her and threw bouquets and even
a whole lilac bush at the prima donna in its haste.
It was a most willowy and graceful Ada, in sheeny
draperies of pale *silk, who bowed acknowledg-
ments. She sang an old song from “ Rodelinda ”
(Handel). It was new to most of the most musi-
cal present, and nine-tenths of the audience had
never even heard, in all likelihood, of the opera

from which it was taken. But if Ada had chanted
any old thing as a preliminary stave there would
have been bliss, utter and complete, in that
adoring throng. Later she gave the in-
evitable “O, That We Two were Maying,” some
Brahms songs, and Wynne’s “ Through Love to
Light.” Percy Grainger brought out the fantastic
Northern spirit of his friend and master, Grieg, as
if inspired. Sametini, the romantic-looking
violinist, played his Mozart gloriously, and in a
Fantasia, on “ Lucia” was quite brilliant. Tenor
Harrison had every sentimental girl gazing into
Nothingness with the far-away rapture of a
spiritualistic seance. A man with a voice like
that has no right to be called Harrison.

week was the ooeasion for an extravagant display of
public welcome by the gaud-Mavor, it was natural for the
public, whose name had thus been taken in vain, to ex-
pect something more than a merely first-class concert
from the distinguished lady and her co. That the public
is disappointed is largely the fault of the aforesaid cere-
monious reception, and of the newspapers which treated
it as a matter of thrilling importance. The artist of five
years ago, who charmed alike the critical and non-critical
with her voice production and her rendering of certain
ballads rather than she impressed them with the beauty
of her tones—the fine-drawn Miss Orossley, ' who got
her best results from “ O that we Two were Maying ! ”
“Husheen,” “Out on the Hocks,” etc., was a very dif-
ferent singer to the Mrs. Muecke who reappeared in Mel-
bourne last week. Her voice has not lost its mellowness
in the higher register. It were absurd to say it has passed
the natural prime of life. But it is certainly out of con-
dition. The singer’s breathing is shorter than of yore ;
there is more than a suspicion of huskiness in the middle
notes ; the whisper has lost its smoothness and carrying
quality ; and in her showiest numbers she relies on her
volume of sound (which is not very great) plus an
organ accompaniment to compel the loud encore
that formerly was won by delicate art. The
difference between the Crossley methods of 1903 and
1908 is so marked that one supposes she has allowed her
voice to slump and will presently sing herself back to
her old form. Meanwhile her charm of personality re-
mains, and her second-best singing is quite good enough
to go on with. Besides, there are four other artists in
the co. The combination is a strong one. John Harri-
son, though not a specially stirring or highly cultured
singer, is a good, robust tenor. Hamilton Earle, the bari-
tone, or basso cantante, has an effective voice with a turn
for humor in it. Leon Sametini, the violinist, can give
points to many who have been more prominently before
the public ; and Percy Grainger is Australia’s representa-
tive pianist. All the same, Percy, five years ago, was more
interesting than he is to-day. We liked him better before
he got his hair cut and became addicted to Grieg. He’s a
scholastic young man. An honest, straightforward, un-
affected performer, he lacks grace and tenderness, and
when he bangs the instrument in a vindictive manner, he
bobs earnestly up and down on his seat without intend-
ing to be funny.

At Melbourne Opera House nobody is
going to leave immediately save the Miles Stavor-
dale Quintet, who are touching their stringed
instruments gently in token of farewell. The
other turns that were are being continued till
further notice. The Marconis, Goodfellow
and Gregson, Hodgson and Lowther, Bluett,
Mignonette Kokin, and the Dogs and Baboons
supply the second part, after the inevitable First
Part has given moderate satisfaction to a more or
less crowded audience.
Dr. Creed, M.L.C., got another oppor-
tunity to say a word for a beloved and ancient
project when he presided at the recent Sydney
meeting of the N.S.W. Cremation Society. Over
20 years ago the doctor barracked so strenuously
for a very desirable reform that he got a
Bill, designed to abolish the “wormy grave,”
through the Upper House. But for once the
Fossil Emporium was too advanced for the
Assembly, and the latter body biffed the measure
out. Now that a Cremation Society has come
along, and that the Rookwood (Sydney) cemetery
authorities are willing to build a crematorium if
funds are forthcoming, Dr. Creed’s hobby may
get a look in. And it deserves to get a big look.
Adolphus Bent has circulated in Victoria
a Referendum Bill, which, though it makes
no provision for the initiative, is a pretty
good Bill as far as it goes. But there
is no hope of Thomas passing it. The
blessed measure is obviously a mere consumer of
time* a filler-up of gaps, an excuse, and a red
herring. No person like Bent ever intended to
pass a Referendum Bill. Deferring is his serious
business, not referring.
Last Tuesday morning’s developments of
the mystery of Mrs. Smith were curious. Miss
Grace Watson was understood to say that she had
once called on William Lyne with a Mrs. Smith,
and that Lyne discourteously addressed the lady
as “Smith.” Lyne telegraphed firm denials, and
demanded the address of Mrs. Smith and the date
of the occurrence, but waited vainly for a reply.
Then on Tuesday morning appeared this :
Miss Grace Watson stated yesterday :
“ I have not the resources of the Commonwealth
Treasury at my disposal for the purpose of sending
private telegrams. I have, therefore, to trespass upon
the indulgence of the press.
“ So sure am I of my information that I am quite will-
ing to allow two members of the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment to investigate the matter, and abide by their de-
cision.
“ I am certain that my informant will be found to be a
little more reliable than the police-sergeant upon whom
Mr. Mauger depended when he made his remarkable
allegations about the drunkenness of the miners of New-
castle.”
That seemed to imply : (1) That Miss Watson
tvasn’t present at the alleged Smith episode after
all, but was trusting to an “informant” ; (2) that
she now accuses Lyne of using public money to
pay for his private telegrams; and (3) that the
only reason why the lady didn’t reply to Lyne’s
telegram and send the address and details of Mrs.
Smith was an unfortunate lack of the necessary’
6d. or Is. or eighteenpence. Yet even then she
might have sent her wire “collect.” Altogether,
it seems a desperately poor explanation.
♦
The Select Committee which the N.S.W. Legis-
lature has appointed to inquire into the coupon
trouble represents another attempt to get rid of
about the most useless parasite that hangs on to
the outskirts of commerce. The coupon person is
neither a producer nor—in any sense worth men-
tioning—a distributor. He doesn’t supply know-
ledge, art, morality, religion nor culture. He
isn’t literature. He isn’t necessarily beauty nor
ornament. He doesn’t make one blade of grass
grow where it didn’t grow before. He doesn’t
increase population. He isn’t a defence. He
isn’t even a picturesque sin. As a gamble, he is
inferior to Tattersall’s. As an advertisement, he
doesn’t seem to amount to anything worth men-
tioning. His one alleged virtue—that he en-
courages cash as against credit trading—is very
doubtful, for he apparently does little or nothing
to prevent his coupons being given on credit .
transactions. There is even a legend in
Sydney—though it is probably only a legend—
about a house of ill-fanie which gave
coupons. In fact, the coupon business seems
to be only an extra caterpillar living on
the already well-chewed leaf of commerce, and
one more added to the already too long list of
non-producers. And just as one parasite leads to
another, the existence of the coupon person has
caused the establishment of an Anti-Coupon
League of N.S.W., which also represents a certain
amount of effort and expense for which the com-
munity has to pay. The Anti-Coupon League
has to liquidate the hall rent and the gas bill
when it gathers together to object to the coupon,
and these items also come out of the profits of
commerce in one waj’ or another. The utter use-
lessness of the whole business should be sufficient
reason for its obliteration,
THE ABOLITION OF JAMES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Miss Grace Watson (Vic.) led off by a story concerning:
a lady in Victoria who was grreatly perturbed as to the
meaning' of the subtle phrase, “ economic independence
of women.” She had heard it at a lecture, and worried
out its true significance, finally making a round of the
district pointing out to all the old ladies how Socialists of
the Karl Marx type proposed to twist the marriage-tie.
On one woman the arguments fell fl it. Even when the
question was put to her straight, thus : “ Do you know
they will take away your husband ? ” she remained placid
and content. But" having thought seriously for a
moment, she asked in turn the question, “Do you really
think anyone would want James?”
Mrs. Alfred Lee declared herself a humanitarian. But
the Socialistic doctrine which advocated taking a child
away from its mother at birth to be reared by the State
was barbarous. —S. M. Herald report.
Sing a song of Socialism—of that fathomless abysm where
no creed or catechism ever shines :
Of that region on Hell’s verges whence the doctrine dire
emerges which denounces and absterges Marriage
Lines !
Sing a bitter song and doleful of the tenets so unsoulful,
reprehensible and ghoulful, some folk hold —
Of the strange and dread phantasms hatched in sulphur-
reeking chasms ; Spooks that give the ’Erald spasms
hot and cold.
Sing the horrible condition of that Place (next to Perdi-
tion) where they plan the abolition of all Ties ;
Where the Socialistic devils in the very lowest levels hold
their diabolic revels on hot pies ;
Where —to be entirely candid—every new-born babe is
branded with hot irons, and promptly handed to the
State,
While despairing mothers, moaning like Lost Souls for
sin atoning, are conducted, feebly groaning, to the
gate !
Sing—and please sing very loudly—of the demons who,
avowedly, wait the husbands who so proudly gave
their names
To the Anti-Soshic ladies, torn from them and flung to
Hades, or some place which they’re afraid is full of
flames!
Sing these monsters’ fell intentions, and their damnable
inventions—which no lady ever mentions save with
grief—
Oh, their rush into our houses to deprive us of our
spouses, and our babies, and our cows, is past belief!
Gott in Himmel ! and Good Gracious! can it be that
these predacious schemes so shockingly audacious
shall prevail?
Shall these Pit,-spawned monsters drive us from our babies
and deprive us of our Jameses —basely rive us from
our Male ?
Shall a horrible hiatus be created in our status—shall
these base Communists rate us less than Man?
Never ! Widow, maid, or mother, we protest to one
another they will have to try some other kind of
plan?
If each gentle James he parted from his Martha broken-
hearted—if such things as that are started, new and
strange,
It might be that James would grieve us, not by trying
to deceive us, but by being glad to leave us for a
change —
Conduct which is now unlawful—Oh, the prospect is
too awful 1 Fancy Scandal’s avid maw full of the
names
Of bold, horrid, cattish Creatures with attractive forms
and features and the naughty, fickle, miserable
James!

PENFOLD'S
WINES
Finding that they are every year getting
further into debt, a few Braybrook (Yic.) coun-
cillors lately proposed to raise the local rate from
Is. to Is. 3d. The representatives of the manu-
facturing parts of the shire were willing to go as
high as Is. 6d., but the cadging, loafing land-
owning delegates outvoted them, and decided to
borrow, and let posterity bear the burden. Having
settled that question, the Braybrook Council con-
sidered the shire inspector’s application for a
“small rise of screw.” This unfortunate public
servant is inspector of nuisances, ditto of thistles,
ditto of dogs, ditto of various other things under
sundry Acts of Parliament. He has to keep a
horse and trap, and he frequently has to toil
on Sundays. Last year Braybrook paid him
£59 17s. 2d., and the shire secretary found him
some casual work that brought his—er—emolu-
ment up to £92 Bs. 3d. altogether. One awful
shire councillor, having learnt this news, remarked
that he “thought the man was very well paid,”
whereupon other sweaters said “ Hear, hear,” and
the request was fired out.

The Illawarra Steam Navigation Co.,
which for a long time had a monopoly of the
fairly lucrative South Coast (N.S.W.) trade, has
come into its own again. The Melbourne Steam-
ship Co., which threatened to become a serious
rival, has withdrawn ; and now the I.S.N. Co.
has bought out the Numba S.S. Co., which was a
really more serious competitor. The chief owner
of the little rival company had built up a fine
trade, and it was his intention to fight the mono-
polist to a finish. He refused the most tempting
offers to sell; but he died lately, and his trustees
were not keen on the business, and have sold out
at a good figure. So the South Coast cocky farmer
is talking of a co-operative company. The Bega
disaster, over which the co. didn’t pay compensa-
tion, sticks in his throat, and the cocky sees in
co-operation his only chance of successfully start-
ing a rival co. which won’t be liable to be bought
out —the usual fate of rival coastal concerns.

One of the myriad Kings that the old Rear-
Admiral of Sydney’s early days left behind him
offered an ingenious explanation to Justice G. B.
Simpson and a jury at Bathurst (N.S.W.) the
other day; but it didn’t wash as well as might
have been expected. King was stock inspector,
in one of the Western districts, and got into the
habit, he says, of rounding up stray sheep and
running them into his paddock until the owner
should claim them. To the city man who
doesn’t quite know what a stock inspector
is, the explanation probably doesn’t seem
half as plausible as it would to a back-
country man, who knows that the stock in-
spector is a sort of superior wood-and-water joey,
at every squatter’s beck and call. However, the
owner of the 40-odd sheep that King ran into his
paddock this time didn’t turn up, so, as he had
been put to some expense, he killed two or three
for mutton, and skinned a few more sick ones to
save their lives, and sold the skins—and then the
trouble started. The squatter whose sheep the
stock inspector was charged with stealing declined
to swear that they were his sheep ; but the Crown
Prosecutor crawled out of that difficulty by aside-
track, and the case went on —went right on to the
jury, which said “Guilty.” And then Justice
Simpson distinguished himself. In Sydney a week
or two previously Judge Rogers had before him
one of J. C. Williamson’s theatre treasurers, who
had dug into the money-box to the extent of some
thousands. His Honor Rogers, evidentlyreckoning
that Livingstone had a few hundreds dropped
away in a stocking somewhere, undertook to cut
down the sentence if £5OO were restored ; where-
upon the S. M. Herald lectured him mildly, and
said it was a Dangerous Precedent. Presumably
on that Dangerous Precedent a hint with regard
to restitution was made in the King case ; where-
upon Justice Simpson, who isn’t a mere District
Court Judge (though, by the way, he was once),
jumped at the chance to say that he couldn’t think
of such a thing—it would be making one law for
the rich and another for the poor. Which is quite
true ; and yet, under the circumstances of his par-
ticular case, Rogers didn’t do such a very absurd
thing. In short, he said—“l believe you’ve got
some of J. C. Williamson’s money stacked away
somewhere. Disgorge it, and I’ll clip a bit off
your sentence.” And there was a lot of plain
horse-sense about that attitude.

me stand and watch the lovely house-
boat-bud, a crimson sunshade in her
hand, swarming upon the Yarra’s brink

that writing ,fat cheques doesn’t hurt !

The Auburn Council, one of the forty-odd
pocket-handkerchief boroughs in which the Sydney
metropolitan area is divided, showed up badly in
a litigation matter last week, when its valuers
sued the Council for their fees. It appears that
the valuers had valued the property in the
borough, and on that value the Council had struck
the rates and collected the money. But it refused
to pay the men their fees, because they had not
furnished a list showing the volume and folio
number according to the Lands Titles Office
records on each separate property valued. The
Judge who tried the case was astounded at the
Council’s cheek. Owing to the beautiful mess the
N.S.W. land laws are in, there is not a single
individual who can swear to the ownership of all
the land in Auburn. On his own experience,
Judge Scholes reckoned that the search-fees,
which would have to be paid to the Lands Titles
Office to find out, first, who owned all the land in
the borough, and second, the exact size of each
parcel, would at least be £20,000, and the work
would take years. So he gave a verdict in full
against the Council, with the hope that, if it ap-
pealed, it would get overwhelmed in Costs.

A recent discussion of the Motor Car Bill, in Vic. Leg.
Assembly, touched upon most points of public objection
to break-neck motoring,, save the matter of the damage it
does to highways, at the public expense. Thus far, the
average citizen has not “had his attention drawn,” as
newspaper letter-writers say, to the awful dust effects of
a motor’s mad career. The hardest road surface gets
more.agitation from the rushing tyres of a smellful auto-
mobile than from a dozen heavily-loaded horse vehicles,
The motor owners should be taxed accordingly, on a
sliding scale. Perhaps it would be a fair thing to tax the
medical motorists more severely than even those who
have no business purpose to serve, for the-doctors prac-
tically advertise themselves by their motoring, and their
increased facility for getting around must have a deplor-
able influence on the deith rate. They can kill more
patients in a given time than they ever killed before. The
motor is an expensive and damageous luxury, confined
almost solely to the moneyed class, and the class which
lives for and by the display of affluence. If this is not
sufficient reason for imposing a municipal tax of £3O a
year on small cars and £5O on big ones, the vaunted
democratic sentiment of Australia doesn’t go for much in
practice.

“Billy S S” - Re Sydney railway sta-
tion and others (B. 24/9/’08). I agree with
“ Talafekau ” as regards moving Sydney
station to Wynyard Square, and endorse
what he says re station hotels. They work
splendidly in the United Kingdom, and
most places of any note have one or more.
They are run by the railways, are well
managed, and I’m sure add considerably
to the profits. For an example of their
convenience: Suppose you are leaving
London, after business, for Nevvcastle-qn-
Tyne, Sunderland, or some northern city.
Your train leaves King’s Cross about 7 p.m.,
and you do not wish to do the full 5£ hours’
journey to Newcastle, having had a tiring
day in town. So you inform the station-
master at King’s Cross that you require
a room at York Station Hotel. He wires
through and books it for you free of
charge. You then discuss a six-course
dinner for 35., smoke a couple of cigars,
and feel quite surprised when you run into
York (198 miles; one stop—Grantham)
about 10.30 p.m. The hotel porters meet
the train and convey the luggage to your
room, free. A hundred yards’ walk along
the platform into the hotel, and within five
minutes of leaving the train you are in your
room, having a wash and probably order-
ing a whisky-and-soda. Next morning,
after breakfast, an hour and a half’s run
will land you at your destination, fresh and
ready for business. These station hotels are
uncommon handy if you arrive in a town
late or after midnight. You just tumble,
as it were, out of the train into bed, and
have no bother about luggage, cabs, fete.
A promising piece of Private Enterprise
has burst up with a loud report in Adelaide. A
financier in a small wav formed the happy idea of
“cornering” the local supply of bottles. He
found it a large contract, but he persevered till he
had 140,000 dozen stacked up—well over a million
and a half of dead marines—and still there were
lots more. Meanwhile, the S. A. Bottle Associa-
tion which exists not for profit but to ensure the
many winemakers and brewers a full circulation
Of fluid-holders, had got busy and bottles soared
to the giddy height of about Is Bd. a dozen. A
real Napoleon of finance would have found means
to unload on the enemy at this famine price, but
when the bottle monopolist tried to do this the
foe saw him coming and side-stepped. Eventually
his capital ran short, and he was compelled to
sell to the association at its own figure. Ihe only
permanent result of the episode is a steady boom
in the local glass-blowing industry, which has ini-
ported several expert workmen.
About a ship that didn’t arrive :
The story of the foundering of the tug Belmore, in the
Gulf of Suez, whilst on the way to SA’dney, makes dreary
reading any way you look at it. It is a narrative wherein a
comparative! v small, powerfully-engined vessel staggered
»*“-»««” f'r lo " r, " -v * •—» w “t -*•
are made to aland where, for want of a 40 percent, duty on
imported ships, such things are merely used. From the
survivors’ accounts, the Belmore, during its half-voyage,
was a cross between a submarine and a coal wharf,
In order to keep its furnaces supplied on the long-
stretchesbetweenports.it had to heap its decks with
bags of coal, and on one occasion there was so much of it
on hoard that the skylight was obscured and four bags had
to be thrown overside to enable the sailors to see what they
were eating. Otherwise it might tiavebeen beetles. When
the water was smooth, the Belmore was a coal wharf ;
when it was a bit rough, it travelled as a submarine. The
seamen seem to have accepted the situation cheerfully
enough until the morning of the sinkage. On that day
the donkeyman was in the engine-room oiling the bear-
ings of the machinery, and a solid green sea fell in and
drenched him. It is generally recognised that when solid
junks of the ocean leap right into the vitals of a ship and
start looking for the fires the situation is serious. The
donkeyman put down his oil-can and climbed on deck to
have a word with the man, at the wheel. What he
chiefly wanted to say began with D. He also
told the steersman that the tug couldn’t stand
it much longer, and that, as soon as he g - ot
through with the engines, he was going to call
the crew together and try and induce them to have some
of the coal thrown overboard. But the meeting was
never held. The sea was sick of ttie Belmore, and as he
came on deck, after completing his work, a wave hit the
submarine coal wharf again, and it turned turtle and
emptied men, coal and other sundries into the deeps,
The loss of the Belmore is, to a certain extent, a reflec-
tion on Australia. Even if we cannot construct batt.l -
ships and 11,000-ton liners—and there isn’t any reason
why we can’t—we might at least construct our own small
craft, such as tugs. The present system of having tfyem
brought from the other end of the world at the risk of
other people’s lives seems a poor, miserable expedient f r
a fairly well-grown country.
NO PHYSICAL MEANS OF SUPPORT.
THE PARSON: “ Young man, before you enter
into the bonds of matrimony, may I ask if
you think you are capable of supporting this
young lady?”
Adelaide, which has not had a divorce in
anything approaching “society ’’ circles for about
20 years, has just learned with a gasp, through its
Supreme Court, that one of its handsomest
girls of the Boer War period has gone vcrv
wrong indeed in South Africa, where she had
joined her Contingenter husband. A little
while back it learned with a similar shock
that a S.A. beauty of an earlier date, long resi-
dent in London, had unfairly beguiled her own
sister’s husband. Adelaide firmly believes that
its girls are the “ straightest ” on earth, but there
seems to be a good deal of Mother Eve in them
when once they get away ; not that Mother. Eve is
definitely mentioned in the law books—Adam v.
Eve, Serpent co-respondent.
THE GHOSTLY AND SUPERFLUOUS HOUND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The bill required every young man to be registered,
like a dog.—Dry Dog Reid.'
Don’t talk to me of dogs ! I hate
The very sight and sound
Of them, for ever at my gate
There sits a ghostly hound.
(Oh, Lord above, it is my fate
To watch him leap and bound /)
No beast of flesh and blood is he ;
His eyes like lanterns glow ;
He capers round me merrily
And smiles—and smiles till—oh I
I yell at him, “ Begone from me ! ”
(Of course, he doesn’t go !)
O, tell the story not in Gath,
He lies beside my chair 1
I see a shadow on the path
And look behind. He’s there !
Sometimes when I am in my bath
I feel his baleful stare.
I’ve never registered my hound,
For he is but a shade,
A phantom brute that makes no sound
Whereof I am afraid ;
The dog-man never calls around ;
No tax is claimed —or paid.

Resuming the subject of the November Lone
Hand (which, as already stated, is to be the best
yet published), some of the “featu-es” were
announced last week, a note now as to some others.
November is “Cup month,” when Australian
interest centres on the Flemington racecourse.
The Lone Hand follows the fashion and has some
special “Cup” features. Alf Vincent contributes
two humorous pages—a Horse s November
Dream. There is a shilling’s worth of laughter in
them alone. Douglas Fry has a racing cover in
colors, and two fine plates of the racehorse in
youth and adultage. An anonymous writer, who
knows all about it, tells how a Melbourne Cup
campaign is conducted ; and Edmund 1' isher con-
tributes an interesting sketch of Byron Moore,
the man who stage-manages the Cup.
Stories are not forgotten. Exclusive of the great
serial, “The Commonwealth Crisis,” there are:
“ A Doer of Deeds,” by A. P. Rogers (illustra-
tions, Sass), a fine story of Australian whaling ;
“Man and the Elements,” by C. W. Slack (illus-
trations, Norman Lindsay), a vivid yarn of love
and bushranging ; “ The Soul of the Melon Man,”
by Mary Elkington (illustrations, Norman

The Victorian edition of “ The Manual of
Accountancy and Commercial Law ” having proved
a great success, an edition for N. S. Wales has
now been produced, and editions for other States
are in preparation. It is very deplorable, but a
fact nevertheless, that one common edition
wouldn’t do for all Australia ; for there are wide
differences in the various State laws relating
to companies, shipping, trustees, bankrupt-
cies, etc. The N. S. Wales edition of the
Manual has been edited by barristers Clive Teece
and H N. Maclaurin, of Svdney ; the general
editor is A. C. Morley, of Melbourne, who is one
of those rare beings, an expert alike in law and
accountancy.' The contents of the volume fall
into three divisions ; a glossary of commercial and
legal terms, a treatise on book-keeping, and a
lucid exposition of the law affecting banking and
commerce. The last portion especially will be
found of the greatest value to commercial houses ;
and a first-class index is one of the good features
of a book that does credit to the editors and to
the publisher, J. P. Elliot, of Melbourne, and of
Wynyard Buildings, Sydney.

A man with a fine resard for time and
place dropped himself into the Yarra right out-
side the Morgue, the other morning, just as the
Coroner was concluding one inquest, and was
ready to take another. A stranger immediately
rushed in and dislocated the proceedings with the
information that a prospective corpse was getting'
itself ready ; whereupon the Court broke up and
hurried out to view the tragedy. Meanwhile, the
attendants prepared the slab and the shower, and
all the other proper preparations were in progress,
when an interfering stranger dived in and brought
the victim ashore and pumped him out ! It
nearly always happens like that —when an episode
is correctly timed and carried out regularly and
orderly, someone interferes and upsets the
arrangements.

This is the published report of Japan’s
arrangements for receiving Sperry and his U.S.
fleet :
Just before the arrival in Japan of the U.S. squadron,
the Japanese fleet will be organised into squadrons, as in
time of war, to carry out manoeuvres, and one of the most
powerful squadrons will be told off for the duty of
welcoming the visitors. It will be .composed of 15 or 16
powerful ships, and is to proceed to a certain point to
meet Admiral Sperry and his fleet, and escort the vessels
to the port of Yokohama. During the stay of the squad-
ron, oneyship will he appointed for attendance on each
American vessel, and when the officers and men come
ashore they will he escorted by the Japanese officers and
men of the companion ship.

THE ELDER (in an encouraging undertone): “ Come, friend, put threepence in the plate."

“Snell”: Dr. Abramowski, of Mildura,
is in Melbourne, trying to convert people with a
gospel of new food, the principal ingredient of
which is raisins. Mildura is the great raisin-pro-
ducing centre, so Father Abramowski is a great
patriot of his parish. The good man says that
since taking to a strict rbgime of raisins and nuts
he feels capable of living for ever, but few people
would want to live for ever on nuts and raisins.
Raisins and nuts render the consumer impervious
to sunstroke and disease, and Abramowski rides
about Mildura in the blazing summer sun bald-
headed. Probably raisins and nuts are
the true antidote to snakebite. Dr.
Abramowski, who carries
raisin and almond cakes to
feed his con verts, recalls Cor-
naro, the celebrated Italian,
who wrote a book recom-
mending a miserable diet of
lentils as a means of attain-
ing the long life, and suc-
ceeded in killing as many
) fools as a tolerably large
! war. The Italian was
peculiarly constructed,
and had the slow meta-
bolic process of a hiber-
nating bear. A spare
diet was simply compul-
sory with him, but the
regime was death to rapid
livers with a correspond-
ing consumption of nerve
force. So that while
Abramowski’s raisin cake
may satisfy him, I would
probably starve on it, and
if it be not fare for me
what care I how fair it be !
A S.A. law-court has
decided that the “ put five
bob on for me,” which
most racegoers have to
endure where a totalisator
exists, is enough to make a
binding contract —if one
accepts the five bob. The
sportsman in this case un-
dertook to get a ticket on
True Scot for the man who
stayed at home. The horse
won, paying a £l3 2s. divi-
dend (for a pound); but when the
backer tried to collect £3 ss. 6d., he
was told that his friend had not
' been able to get a ticket, owing to the crush
at the tote windows. The Court thought that,
while this was doubtless true in the particular in-
stance, it was a dead easy thing to say in any
case, and it ordered the good-natured person to
pay up. ,
The perennial mixed-bathing question has
undressed itself again along the eastern shores of
Port Phillipßay( Vic.), and the Sandringham “Pro-
gress” Association is once more grappling with
the problem. One section declares that the spec-
tacle of “ bathers of both sexes parading the beach
in Zulu and Kaffir costumes” is subversive of true
morality and a menace to the constitution, besides
tending to drive capital out of the country ; while
an opposing section uses the other arguments that
are almost as weary and worn-out. And mean-
time, while the “authorities” haggle, thousands
of Melbourne citizens who wish to get into the
water somewhere and- somehow have to undress
behind a sand-hummock or on the open beach,
because the fool authorities haven’t had sufficient
common sense to put up a few dressing-rooms, or
even plant a protecting hedge.
There was one most sinister-looking inci-
dent in connection with that marvellous mal-
administration of justice, the Westport (M.L.)
murder case (B. 8/10/ 08). When placed on trial
for the murder, Anderson and Hallinan (who were
wrongfully convicted and sentenced to seven
years) were both anxious to give evidence, but
were dissuaded from doing so by their counsel,
Mr. Herdman. In his summing-up. Justice
Chapman laid stress on the fact of the accused not
being put in the witness-box, and no doubt the
jury was thus considerably influenced in finding
the men guilty. Herdman has since explained to
the Court his reason for preventing the men
giving evidence. He states that he was shown by
the authorities, as a favor, a list of alleged pre-
vious convictions against Anderson, disclosing
such a bad record that he dare not put the man in
the box. Incredible as it may seem, it has trans-
spired that the list shown to Herdman was either
a criminal fake ora miserable blunder, and had no
connection with the accused whatever. The most
charitable construction to be placed on this
remarkable case is to assume that Connelly, the
ignorant boy-informer and subsequent self-con-
fessed murderer, exercised some sort of hypnotic
influence all round.
Brief moan from a man in the U.S.: —
Mrs. Grace Love, who holds the world’s championship
for divorce, lately appeared in a Californian Court to
support her sixth application for judicial separation—
this time from Hugh M. Love, a journalist and poli-
tician, hanging-out at,Los Angeles. Love, with pheno-
menal recklessness, had married the lady after she had
tried five lots of assorted matrimony, each of which had
ended in divorce. There was the usual incompatibility
of temperament or jaw-action between the pair. Hugh M.
was inclined to be exasperating and insubordinate in his
manners and skin garniture, while Mrs. Hugh appears to
possess the nerves of a fragile jim-jam. She told the
Judge that, during the progress of a piano-bang given
to some friends, her husband had anticked
the proceedings in his pyjamas and a bath robe'
of fierce terrestrial pink, had crowded into a
chair and started to smoke. She didn’t like it, and
her friends were so disgusted that they folded up
their vamps and fled from the premises. So, according
to custom, which by now must be getting monotonous,
she asked for a divorce and obtained it. Twenty-four years
ago she commenced to fizzle as a news item by eloping
with a gentleman named Frank N. Coffin, whose affection
for her, in the light of after events, must have been
omnivorous. They tore their food in harmony for ten
years, when she secured a divorce on the ground of mental
anguish. Two or three years later, when their only child
became an angel, they were reunited and remarried ; but,
as Coffin had apparently become a settled absorbent of
booze, she bounced him out a second time a few months
afterwards. Next she tried J. C. Walker, a bank clerk,
which experiment ended just as similarly and just as
briefly. No. 4 was again the adhesive Coffin, who was,
for the third time, divorced the same year. With No. 5,
one P. A. Layman, a clerk at a Los Angeles pub, she
lived just two years, and finally got a divorce from him
on the ground of cruelty. Her sixth and latest essay in
wedlock has already been mentioned, and, considering
that she has abundant vitality and seems to have years
to live, it is not likely to be her last.

The N.S.W. Clerks’ Union project moves
in astonishing fashion. A big meeting of the
downtrodden was held at the Trades Hall, New-
castle, last week, and at it 50 and odd members
were enrolled. A hundred more signified their
intention of joining at the next meeting of the
Union. Forty-four hours toil per tveek and a
minimum wage on an age basis (for example, all
pen-pushers of 21, years and over are to be paid
£2 10s.) are the reasonable objectives the clerks
set before themselves; The Sydney Union has
400 members already, and it is swelling like a
rolled snowball. A Wages Board to regulate the
conditions of clerical labor in N.S.W. will shortly
be applied for, and then of a surety the cup of
grief and disgust appertaining to the employer
who thinks he should get his adult clerk for the
same money as he pays his nigger cook will over-
flow. And the tragedy is, that the modern clerk
with nerve and enterprise enough to go unionis-
ing won’t sympathise with the smitten one to the
value of a small bottle of copying-ink.

TO A DOOMED FERRY STEAMER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
After 43 years of active service the paddle ferry steamer
Brightside—known earlier in her career as the Emu—has
been disposed of to he broken up. For very many yeais
the Brightside was a familiar object in Port Jackson, and
safely conveyed many tens of thousands of holiday-
makers to Manly.
Let others tell, now that you’ll soon he gone,
In daily paper prose, blank verse, and rhyme,
How many tons of coal you’ve burned,
How many thousand pounds you’ve earned,
How oft the Heads’ long rollers spurned.
Such things I put aside, and dwell upon
The lovers you have carried in your time.
Think of it. You began in ’65.
And straight you teemed with girls with downcast eyes
And crinolines ; and grave young men
In tall silk hats. It’s more than ten
To one they said the same things then
The girls and boys say who are now alive,
And of an age to take to swapping lies.
“ Bustles ” came in : quaint, futile parasols,
In shape like mushrooms and well nigh as small,
Were used by those who loved such things.
Followed the Grecian gown that clings ;
The female droop, suggesting wings
Angelic, which du Maurier extols ;
And you, old craft, you looked upon them all.
With stolid front you watched the world progress,
As year by weary year your engines drove
Your shaking hull from place to place,
* Saw youth with age come face to face
And yield up comeliness and grace.
Folks changed in customs, manners, looks and dress,
Only they kept their way of making love.
Concerning love for over 40 years
They blithered in your secret nooks, and spoke
Maundering falsehoods by the score,
And then breathed deep and told some more,
Riling you to the very core,
One doubts not, in that you were cursed with ears,
And could not stop the same with stoke-hold coke.
You’re doomed ; and yet I do not sympathise ;
Life nowadays can be no Sabbath treat
To one whose knowledge is as wide
As yours. The charming little bride,
Her groom—he of the manly stride—
The worthy parents at his side
Are sepulchres—not white, but pied—
To you. Into their pasts you’ve spied
And looked up, disillusion in your eyes. ...
No : you’re a craft to whom death must seem sweet. .

ORANGE BLOSSOM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The widow looked at the orange tree,
“ And when will it bloom again ? ” said she.
The bachelor of antiquitee,
Whose hair with the years had fled,
Looked up at the branches, black and bare,
With a really fierce, malignant stare,
And hissed at the widow waiting there,
“ Thank Heaven, the tree is dead ! ”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Life, you have taken and tossed me, a leaf on the wave of
a river,
Down where the shatters of sunbeams through the amber
heart of it quiver ;
Life, you have laughed like a woman, wanton, red-lipped
and destroying,
Casting away for fresh fancies the love that her bosom
found cloying ;
Mine was the peace of still waters where petals of lilies
are lying,
Only the song of the reed beds, and only the summer
winds sighing ;
Mine was the rest of green pastures, and mine the long
drowse of the noon,
Sleep without dreams was my portion ’neath the passion-
less kiss of the moon.
But Life, you came, snatched me and flung me into the
heart of a fire
That is luring, fearful and fierce with the flame of a
quenchless desire.
The mist is deep on my pastures... the moon is so far
and so cold. ...
While in the ash of the fire leaps a flicker of ruby and
gold.
Face to face with the blank of the futur , sprung from
a wreckage of strife.
On the wheel of your whims I am broken—what would
you now of me, Life?

This State Land Bank, which took down the shutters
first in 1897, is managed by the Government Savings
Bank Commissioners, and raises money on 3 and 3J
per cent, debentures. It has never been able to get par
for even the 3£ per cent. issues ; and in 1904, just after
the bad drought, it only got £95 10s., which meant that,
at the minimum price, the institution was paying
£4 2s. Id. percent. In consequence, it had to put up its
lending rate from 4|- p.c. to 4J p.c. And just when it
-had been obliged to do that—for it couldn’t borrow at
£4 2s. Id. and lend at £4 10s. after paying expenses—good
seasons began to pour money into private banks, etc.,
and it was ari easy matter for farmers to g-et accommo-
dation elsewhere. Hence the falling'-away in this
bank’s advances ; more was paid back in instalments
than was advanced to new borrowers. During last year,
as money was borrowed at £3l3s. 3d. per cent., the lend-
ing rate was kept to 4J per cent., to which it had been
reduced late in the previous year ; and the number of
applications increased again—partly no doubt because of
the lower rate, partly because it became a less simple
matter to tap the private banks on the recent favorable
terms. In 1905 the loan applications numbered 689 ;in
1906, 788 ; in 1907, 550 ; and in the past year, 704.
Not having got par when it has issued its de-
bentures, the bank has accumulated a total of £28,012 of
discounts ; that is to say, in return for the low rate of
interest which its debentures carry, it has undertaken to
pay £28,012 of principal which it never received. This
amount is being steadily written off out of revenue :
£14,119 has been disposed of to date, leaving £13,893 still
to he put by. In the table above, this amount, being
represented by nothing at all, is not regarded as an asset,
and is deducted from the reserves.

In Maoriland the expenses in the past year amounted to
6s. I'd. per cent, of advances ; but the latter exceeded
£4,180,000. Administration should be no more costly in
Victoria —rather less costly, in fact, the State being more
compact. If, therefore, there were more Victorian
farmers to make use of this bank, and if a larger propor-
tion of those for whose benefit it has been established did
make use of it,'there might easily be a reduction of \ per
cent, in the interest, and possibly' more. In many way's
the Victorian farmer suffers through the existence of big
estates, carrying only sheep. For one thing, his railway
carriage costs him more than it need; for another, his
hanking accommodation costs him more.
The balance-sheet doesn’t show a single fore-
closed property on hand. One was on hand 12 months
ago, but it has been got rid of at a price
which paid up arrears, interest, and expenses. That is
Cheerful. But still it ought to lead to reflections. A
bank doesn’t get properties left on its hands while the
market is moving up. A man may' not be paying his
way ; he may have undertaken to pay more than the
property will stand ; but as long as somebody else will
undertake to pay still more, a bank won’t show any fore-
closures. Yet they are just the circumstances under
which both land-buyers and people who lend on land-
mortgage need to be suspicious.

In 1899 this co. had estates in hand valued at £1,230,958 ;
but so rapidly has it gone ahead that the total is now
£3,001,859, and this notwithstanding that the last few
years have been very' favorable to the winding up of
estates and the completion of trusts. Undoubtedly this
increase has been very largely due to the growing belief
in trustee cos. . The old private trustee often died before
the man for whom he was going to act; and that meant
an alteration of the will, with Costs. Or he died soon
after the man, who made the will —more Costs. The
trustee co. doesn’t die. It doesn’t leave the country.
And it makes a specialty of this trustee busi-
ness. Moreover, it puts up a substantial cash
guarantee that it will do what the law says a
trustee co.- must do, and that it won’t do what
it says he mustn’t do. This co. has put up £25,000 (2s.
6d. per share), and the shareholders have made them-
selves responsible for another £975,000 (£4 17s. 6d. per
share). Profits are derived from an annual commission
on the revenue of trust estates and from one commission
on the capital value. This co. takes credit for the latter
only as the estate is realised and the commission actually
received. The profits for any one year are therefore
governed to a great extent by the realisations. As to the
cost to the,.estates : this co.’s income last year was
£10,528. The mean of its own invested funds was £47,752.
Assuming'that that earned an average of 4J per cent, (the
funds are On deposit with the Government or on mortgage),
then the balance of the income would represent ss. lOd. per
cent.,On the average amount of the trust estate balances.
In otHer. words, so far as can be calculated, administra-
tion by. this co. costs an estate on the average about ss.
10d: percent, of its capital value. And yet, though this
is so little above J percent., the profit shows a return
for the year of no less than £l2 13s. 4d. per cent, on the
co.’s own capital and reserves. The explanation, or most
of the explanation, is that a very big trustee business can
be carried on with a very small capital; in fact, the co.
scarcely needs any capital at all, except for guarantee
purposes.

and largely for that purpose has nailed up its brass plate
in many ports of Great Britain and foreign parts ; also it
does considerable fire business in S’Africa as well as
throughout Australia. Partly because of that foreign
connection, partly because the old name used up too
much breath and stationery, the co. altered itself from
“The South British Fire and Marine Insurance Co. of
New Zealand” to “The South British Insurance Co.”
during the past year. At about the same time it limited
the liability of its shareholders and got authority to take
accident, guarantee, and similar classes of business. The
shares (200,000 of them) are 10s. paid, and are liable for a
further £4 105.7 so that policy-holders are not injured by
the change. In fact, solid men will hold a share with a
£4 10s. liability when they would shy off a share with
unlimited liability ; so in practice the limitation of lia-
bility is probably in policy-holders’ favor.
The co. does a very big Maoriland business;
and it is generally admitted that the rates there, cut
down when the State office showed its nose two or three
years ago, are quite unprofitable. An office may in a
normal year escape loss ; but it is not able to make pro-
vision for the practically inevitable hard knocks that will
be felt presently. The too-finely cut rates result, of
course, in reduced profits ; and they also affect the loss
and expense rates, because practically neither loss nor
expenses would be affected in the bulk if the premiums
were 10 per cent, higher. That explains some of the
more recent movements shown hereunder :

No doubt the organisation of the accident and guarantee
business is also partly responsible for the increase in the
expense rate.
This co. hasn’t adopted to any large extent the
pretty common fire-insurance plan of capitalising re-
serves ; there was not much, if anything, to be gained by-
doing that so long as the co. was unlimited. Hence the
dividends are very tall. As shown above, however, the
year’s interest (£29,663) was equal to over 29} percent, on
the capital. In other w'ords, the interest, mainly from
undivided profits, was sufficient to pay all but £337 of the
dividend, leaving practically the whole of the profit from
the insurance business to go to a fund for the further pro-
tection of policyholders. Under such conditions the
grow’th of the reserves has been admirable. For
every £lOO of net premiums received last year
the co. has £l7l of funds. The 19 great British
offices had a premium income of £24,260,573 in
1907, and they had £34,181,367 of capital and reserves.
Thus they had a provision of £l4l for every £lOO of
premiums, w-hile the South British has a provision of
£l7l. The co.’s popularity is therefore built on the best
and surest of foundations.

This co.’s original capital was £50,000 ; but £75,000 of
accumulated profits have been at various times trans-
ferred to capital, thus reducing shareholders’ liability
from £4 to £2 10s. per share. In the foregoing, the divi-
dends are calculated on the £50,000 actually paid ; the
10 per cent, represents only 4 per cent, on the basis of
the whole £125,000. The co. has continued its run of bad
luck. First there w’as the long and expensive litigation
over some of the profits of the life assurance branch ; the
result of that w'as the transfer of £42,000 back to the Life
fund. As shown above, this (and Costs) cut into the
reserves to the extent of £55,521. The year 1906-7 was a
disastrous time in marine underwriting ; and in the past
year neither fire nor marine business has been done at
sufficiently remunerative rates, though the marine depart-
ment shows a very small profit. This sets out the two
years’ results in the three branches :
1907. 1908.
Fire Profit £2746 Loss £4177
Marine Loss 8693 Profit 183
Guarantee and Accident.. Profit 2021 Profit 1323
Net Underwriting Loss £3926 Loss £2671
Interest earnings for the past year were £4626 ; and these,
after paying income tax and a few other items, transform
the underwriting loss into a profit for the year of £954.
Combining the results of the fire and marine
business these have been the recent experiences of the
co. :

The increase in the year’s expense rate is no doubt due
to the fact that the co., after its bad experience in the
marine branch, eased off in that direction a trifle, and
pushed the fire business harder to make up for it ; and
fire business, which means small premiums as a rule,
consequently means heavy expenses, while marine busi-
ness can be run for from 20 to 25 per cent. —this co.’s out-
lay last year was just under 24 per cent.of net premiums.
However, from the very nature of things, these insurance
cos., unless they are of colossal size, can’t expect uniform
results from year to year : they are mostly not big enough
for the law of averages to swing round in during the 12
months. On that account, bad things are liable to hap-
pen to the moderate-sized co. which, on the strength of
an unusually lucky year, bumps up its dividend, and thus
mops up all, or nearly all, the surplus revenue. This co.
isn’t quite as bad as some in that respect ; but it is pretty
bad. In the past 10 .years, even if it had not been obliged to
pay over anything to the Inf e fund, it w-ould only have in-
creased its reserves by a poor little £4333. And meantime
its fire and marine premiums (the only test one has of its
risks) have increased from £41,334 to £58,529. Of course,
the co. couldn’t have known when it was paying the big
dividends in 1899-1904 that it would presently have to
hand over £55,521; but from the foregoing figures it
ought to be clear that, when the tide turns and the busi-
ness shows large profits again, much ought to be done in
the way of strengthening the reserves. And that can only
be done by sitting down hard on the dividends.
No new life business has been taken in the
ordinary way for many years. The figures in regard to
that branch come next:—

The shareholders get one-fourth and the policy-holders
three-fourths of the profits in this branch. On the
average of the Life funds (the investments are not
separated from those of the other funds in the balance-
sheet) ihe interest return credited to the Life account was
at the rather poor rate of £3 13s. 4d. per cent. As only a
very small amount is in Government securities, it looks
as though some of the assets are a good deal over-valued.

In 1905 the directors did a little in the W'ay of writing
dow'n, and provided £12,044 as a depreciation reserve.
That, however, was nothing like enough, and in conse-
quence of the arrival of a new and more energetic broom
in the manager’s office a further £10,830 was swept out,
making the total of the two lots £22,874, E\en this was
inadequate ; w herefore, presumably in order to make
quick sales of non-productive assets, further amounts
have had to be written off to provide for losses on sales at
prices under book values. Twelve months ago advances
and foreclosures, lumped together, totalled £182,859 at
the written-down value. Ou August 31 this year the total
was £188,396. Meantime, however, according to the di-
rectors’ report, £22,468 (book value) Of property has been
sold for £21,145. Evidently, therefore, either little or no
cash has been paid on account of these sales, ora very con-
siderable new business has been done. It would improve
the look and the value of the balance-sheet if the ad-
vances were separated from the foreclosures —the old
written-down foreclosures, at any rate. Apparently the
co. is out after new' business ; and one W'ay to stress that
fact is to show that that new business is expanding, as it
evidently' is. On the mean of the investments and the
advances, foreclosures, etc., as written down, the average
gross return was about 7 per cent. ; and that is good
enough to suggest that there is not a great deal of over-
valuation, and not many unproductive lines on the
books. The total liabilities (nearly all deposits) were
£120,691 at the end of August, as against £127,991 in 1907.
Part of the reduction has been due to the sale of State
securities ; part to the reduction of balances in other
banks. A very substantial shrinkage in interest has fol-
lowed —from £5562 to £5291. They appear to have been
expensive deposits, that have been got rid of. The de-
posits, etc., are now rather less than 1J times greater
than the shareholders’ funds (assuming that the reserves
are all sound); wiping out the reserves altogether, how-
ever, the deposits are about 40 per cent, greater than the
capital. This seems a perfectly safe proportion ; judging
by the interest return as w'ell as by' the prices w'hich have ■
been realised, the £188,396 of advances, etc., are worth a
good deal more than the total liabilities, and there are
£15,000 of liquid assets and £lO,OOO (book value) of office
premises in addition. The co. deserves well nowadays.
It had a very fair cleaning-up ; and it did not hesitate,
when the need was shown, to drop dividends altogether,
and then resume them only in a very modest fashion.

Before the year with which the foregoing list opens, the
society had paid no dividend since the boom-smash of the
early ’nineties. Down to 1902 the accounts had the
lumping habit rather badly; this comparison shows
details for the subsequent years :

1908 .. 19,294 81,587 36,797 859
The losses on the foreclosures have been provided for out
of a contingency fund which in 1902 amounted co £24,979.
As it now'stands at £10,600 it seems that £32,060 (book
value) of properties have realised £14,379 less than that,
or £17,681. Things may, how’ever, be rather better than
that, because other properties may have fallen into the
society’s hands meantime, so that more than £32,060
(book value) of properties may’ have been sold. At the
same rate the £36,797 in hand would be worth about
£20,500 ; and the difference would absorb a good deal
more than the present contingent fund. This fund, by
the way, is included with the reserves in the first table
above ; hence the reserves are described as nominal.
The new' business shows a very satisfactory growth, and,
though of course the nature of the risk that the society is
taking can’t be arrived at, the business for the present is
very profitable : the return averages £8 7s. per cent, on
the mean of the advances. The foreclosures give, on the
other hand, a very poor net return —on the average about
2i per cent, after paying insurance, rates, repairs, etc.
This low return may possibly be partly due to the holding
of suburban building lots which give no return at all.
The liabilities have grown a good deal in the last few
years ; but the “ new ” advances—those w’hich yield the
aforementioned £8 7s. per cent, gross—are four times
greater than the liabilities ; so the creditors are most
amplv protected.

The reserves are described as nominal because among the
assets is an item, “ Goodwill, trade marks, patent rights,
leases, etc., at cost (less £1:1,716 written off), £137,524.”
Originally the goodwill item was £125,000 ; for the right
to the name, and for the things that J. B. Dunlop found
out about pneumatic tyres in 1888 and subsequently, the
co. paid £45,000 in cash, 20,000 deferred non-cumulative
7£ per cent. pref. shares, and 70,000 ordinary shares.
That totals £135,000 ; for the extra £lO,OOO the vendors
threw in a bit of furniture, etc. Later on a few more
patents, etc., and otiier goodwill items- things which
you can’t taste, smell, or drive a nail into—were secured ;
so that these intangible assets now represent probably
£120,000 or a trifle more. For a while the co. merely
produced the bicycle tyre ; fortunately before the craze
part of bicycling blew out, Federation arrived, with
inter-State Freetrade and Protection against the world ;
and so the co. was able to launch out into
a general rubber-goods manufacturing business. To
provide capital for the extensions, 168,000 cumulative
pref. shares have been issued. There are now these
168,000 cumulative pref. 7 per cent, shares; 20,000
non-cumulative 7J per cent. pref. shares ; and 90,000
ordinaries. After the two lots of pref. shares have been
satisfied the ordinaries draw up to 9 per cent. ; after that
they all share alike. In the past year all denominations
get an extra 2 per cent., which brings up the average
paid on ordinaries from the outset to a shade over 4£ per
cent. ; and there is, of course, nothing outstanding on
the pref. shares. So far as ordinary shares are concerned
it is necessary to remember the two large mouths that
stand between them and dividends; and, generally, there
are three other points that can’t be overlooked —(1) the
size of the purely paper items ; (2) the extent of stocks
(now no less than £155,048, in addition to £44,112 book
debts); (3) the overdraft (£67,377),'0n top of a £lO,OOO
mortgage. With stocks and book-debts of that size, the
declared profits must, of course, be more or less of an
estimate only, dependent upon the valuation of these
assets. Still the co. has now got a fine start, in a field
that will go on extending, no doubt; and Australia
owes it something for the energy it has thrown into the
development of a practically new industry.

A part of the last line is an estimate ; it is assumed that
the usual bonus to the staff will be paid, and £5O has been
deducted from profits on that account. Then it is as-
sumed that the dividend (6 per cent.) and the bonus on
purchases (also 6 per cent.) will absorb £llOO. This, with
the amount wiitten off, will leave £336 to add to the
reserves. All the information that the published accounts
and directors’report give is that the balance to be car-
ried to the reserve fund will be “ about £300.” For some
years the bonuses, absorbing all the profits, were paid in
the shape of new'shares, and that system threw a heavy
weight upon the business. Latterly, however, a reserve
fund has been growing up ; and this will help the society
through, for it won’t be expected to pay interest or
dividends on that money as it was expected to do
when all the reserves were straight away transferred to
capital. Book debts have been steadily creeping up—
-1906, £2378 ; 1907, £2869 ; 1907, £3016. This may be due
to the extension of business ; but growth of book debts
in a co-operative society is never a pleasant feature. The
fact is that a brilliant idea has lately struck some alleged
co-operators and is being w'orked for all it is worth ; just
in case anything should go wrong, they get into debt to
the society and stay in debt to the amount (or there-
about) of their interest in the concern. Probably because
they see that that idea is gaining ground the directors of
this society are taking steps to alter the articles, so as to
allow them to withhold bonuses, dividends, etc., in such
cases, and also to sell the share and wipe out the debt.
Provided the stock has been taken carefully there is no
reason why shareholders should be nervous about this
society, and if a few of them lose their 6 per cent, invest-
ment for the reason above stated it will probably do them
good and the society no harm.
* * * *
In Broken Hill one of the troubles of the mill-
man is the sliming tendencies of the fine-grained ore ex-
tracted from the deep levels of the mines. The loss of
lead and silver through sliming is considerable at the best
of times, but with a bard, fine-grained sulphide, mixed
with a little rhodonite, it becomes serious. The ore con-
sists of such minute crystals that, in order to get the
metal particles out of it, fine crushing has to be adopted ;
and this results in the reduction of some of the metal to
such apowder that, instead of remaining with the con-
centrates, it flows away with the water, and can only be
recovered in the settling dams. The B. H. Proprietary is
finding this difficulty in dealing with the ore from its
lower levels, but as the co. has an inexpensive method of
treating its large output of slimes, the tendency to
slime does not so much matter to that co. as yet.
When, however, the co. comes to depend almost en-
tirely on its deep levels, the question may be
more serious ; for even specially sintered slimes don’t
make very good food for a smelting furnace. With Block
10 the sliming question has been getting more serious
every month, and, in spite of elaborate combinations of
mechanical appliances, the loss of metals in milling is
greater now than it was 12 months ago. The problem
involved is a tough one, but it is being earnestly tackled
at more than one mill along the line of lode.
* * * *
The lode in the south end of the 1315 ft. level
of Block 10, Broken Hill, found no favor in the
eyes of the management for a long time, on account
of its shrunken and crooked appearance. When
within little more than 100 ft. of the southern
boundary, hou'ever, it began to widen out, and with
greater bulk came better metal contents. The bulge has
given 10ft. or more wide of really good milling ore, and
there is a possibility of the increased width and quality
being maintained right on to the boundary. These favor-
able circumstances have served to lift a little of the gloom
that had settled on the face of the management because
of the unsatisfactory and puzzling nature of the ore body
at the 1465 ft. level. This unworthy offspring of the
hitherto rich Block 10 lode has still a large wedge of
rhodonite jambed in the pit of its stomach, and rho-
donite causes more sulphurous language at the mill than
all the other ore put together.
* * * *
Although, like every other Broken Hill mine,
Block 10 has its little troubles underground and at the
mill, it ought to be able to claim an encouraging pat on
the back when the half-yearly slate comes to be shown.
(The co.’s half-year ended on Sept. 30.) P’or some time
past a saving in fuel amounting to about £lOO per week
has been effected, without any decrease of mechanical
efficiency, while on top of that it is almost certain that
working costs in other directions will have been reduced.
The mill, too, did increased work. At the end of the pre-
vious six months the concentrates produced totalled
11,762 tons, and the recoveries were 72 per cent, of the
lead and 40'6 per cent, of the silver. The output of con-
centrates to the end of September was 13,184 tons, or an
increase of 1422 tons. The extraction works out at a
fraction less, but that is probably owing to increased
losses through sliming.

Recent developments at the Junction, Wyalong
(N.S.W.), point to a prosperous time ahead. The shaft is
now down 1100 ft. on 12oz. mineral. The Junction was a
prolific gold-producer in the early days, but the shoot of
gold disappeared when the hard country was struck.
After years of hard work that or some other shoot has
now been picked up, and manager Jimmy Williams has
been relieved of a lot of anxiety. A battery is going up
to treat low-grade stone, of which there are about 1400
tons paddocked. At the 800 ft. in the south level mineral
is showing in a 3ft. channel for a distance of 500 ft.

In the calculation of working costs in concen-
trating mills and workshops, every small item should be
taken into consideration. It is the small and uncon-
sidered factors, involving waste of power, that make for
high working costs. The type of bearing employed has a
marked effect on the power consumed in overcoming
friction. Recent exhaustive tests emphasised the marked
superiority of the Hj'att Flexible Roller Bearings over all
other types of roller, sleeve, and other anti-friction
bearings. Under equal conditions the loss of power due
to friction in Hyatt Flexibles is 23 per cent, less than
with the best soiid roller.bearing,.and, 65 per cent, less
that with babbit metal journals. Messrs. W. and J.
Lempriere, 506 Little Collins Street, Melbourne, will be
glad to supply further information to those interested.

A copper smelting furnace, designed to embody
the recommendations of the best Australian and American
experts, has just been constructed for the Great Fitzroy
Gold and Copper Mines Ltd., Queensland. The furnace is
of large capacity, being capable of turning out 100 tons of
ore per day. It is rectangular in shape, and is higher
in column in proportion to its hearth area than is
customary. By this means both the roasting and
oxidisingoperations will be conducted in the same furnace,
the oxidising being done in the upper portion and the
smelting in the lower. The furnace has two tiers of mild
steel water jackets. The lower tier rests on a c.i. plate,
supported on c.i. standards, or, should hearth plate be
removed, the tier will be swung on girders ; the upper
tier of jackets is always swung from girders supported on
columns. The columns are held together by a strong c.i.
frame. The air blast passes from a pipe encompassing
the furnace through Hustle pipes to the tuyeres. The
Austral Otis Engineering Company, South Melbourne,
have designed and built this furnace.* L 1

The Broken Hill miners are restive, and a little
bad management would cause a lot of trouble. Fortu-
nately, on the mineowners’ side the chief executive
officer is G. D. Delprat, a man who isn’t at all likely to
do anything to stroke their fur the wrong way. The
wages agreement will expire at the end of December ;
but a conference will be held next month to try to
arrange another one. It is not likely that any serious
reductions in pay will be pressed for. A couple of the
cos. may want the knife used, but the majority don t
seem to think that good men are getting too much. Oi
course, costs during the boom were extravagantly high ,
but that wasn’t because good men got too much. It "as
mainly because it paid the cos. during the metal boom to
put on any sort of man ; and with the \yasters weeded
out costs per ton have come down by shillings.

“ Speculator” (who puts the case in much the
same way as a couple of other angry correspondents). Me
the Hillgrove Proprietary. Two meetings have been held
in Sydney, really to protest against the very sudden
action of the management in closing down the mines.
The reason given for this action is that the gold has dis-
appeared. Yet only a few weeks prior to this sudden
disappearance of the metal, shareholders were officially
informed that one level alone contained £30,000 worth of
gold, and that the new finds had given the mine a new
life (vide last London report and cable). Now, what has
become of all this? The Eleanora section was also said to
be a bonanza. This most people knew was a difficult
problem, antimony being prominent; but the fertile-
brained engineer who has spent £50,000 of the company s
and mortgagees’ money thought it a simple matter.
However, we should like to know why this sudden change
has taken place ; and the shareholders who held these
meetings deserve the gratitude of the speculative public
for their determination to probe the matter to the core.
There are two mortgages ; the first to an engineering
firm which employs the engineer on the mines. Would
this company be likely to lend £12,500 if the property
were worthless ? The second mortgage is held by two
large shareholders in Sydney, who advanced money
through representations made by officials of the co.
What can you make of it all ?

Various rumors are moving with regard to the
future of Oannindah (Q.), which in its expiring effort suc-
ceeded in producing a few tons of copper at something
like £lBO per ton. There have been spasmodic quotations
for shares during the last few weeks, varying from buyers
3d. to sellers Is., and it is supposed that someone is will-
ing to trade in a big parcel. There is some chance of a
start being made when the labor exemption expires early
next year, and big southern holders are said to be in con-
sultation with the chief sufferer, Robert Philp, as to the
policy to be adopted. At the present price of the metal,
and with the plant at their disposal, it is difficult to see
what can be done. At least few will have the temerity' to
tackle Thomas Gibb’s scheme, by which he proposed to
make the concern pay at under £6O. The first essential
appears to be a manager who has had quite a lot of ex-
perience in handling low-grade propositions. There has
been too much experimental management here.

News from Charters Towers about the East
Mexican and New Brilliant Freehold is of the usual op-
timistic nature. No. 7 has been driven considerably
more than 500 ft., and has 18in. good mineral stone ini the
face. No. 6 in the Mexican ground also proved about
60ft. of exceptionally rich stone; yet, although the last
crushing was worth over £ll a ton, it disappointed the
market. The barren ground in No. 5 has, of course,
tempered the hopes regarding No. 6. The latest news is
more favorable with regard to No. 5. No.. 6in the hang-
ing wall section of the New B. Freehold is also looking
well, and a trial crushing should liven things up. The
Chart rs Towers market is supported to some extent by
London ; that is particularly the case with Mills United,
whose shares have been steadily absorbed by J. Bull,
mainly on the strength of the careful way the mine and
finances have been handled. How long the good things
will last is another matter, which the average “ investor
won’t inquire into until it is too late. The immediate
outlook of Mills is, nevertheless, good—perhaps the best
on the field, taking all things into account. But it must
always be remembered that the Towers is a field of rapid
changes.
* * * *
Bonnie Dundee, Charters Towers, reports a
crushing of 602 tons for £2987, which will mean a six-
penny div. (£3000). Cash resources were magnified when
first reported ; nothing was allowed for depreciation, and
needful repairs to the Bonnie Dundee milling plant have
been held over. It is possible, had not a good haul been
made by selling forfeited shares, the dividend would not
have been declared so soon. Apart from the fact that the
main level at H2of t. has not yet proved payable, develop-
ment work has been fortunate, and no less than three
intermediate levels, 90ft. apart, are being driven to cut
out the block of ground up to the Queen Central bound-
ary. No. 2, which is 180 ft. above the main level, pro-
duced the bulk of the 1479 tons crushed for a return
averaging about £4 15s. per ton. This level has been
stoped for 250 ft. Recently No. 3 intermediate level has
been started to cut out the block of stone on the bound-
ary. The driving of this No. 3 level suggests that ore
reserves are limited.
* * * *
Brilliant Extended, Charters Towers, has a
credit balance of £6200, most of which was made during
the last month out of a yield of £11,115 from 5000 tons
(about £2 4s. 2d. per ton). To get increased profits with
declining ore values is not often accomplished on the
Towers f but it has been done in this case. The market,
however, is not taking to Brilliant Extendeds, because of
the erratic nature of the underlie, which is down 92ft.
below No. 17 ; and, to make things worse, the reef has
pinched at the end of the level. Yet, as a whole, the
mine is looking fairly well.
***■*■
Promised improvements on the Oriental and
Columbia lines of reef, Gympie (Q.), are developing rather
leisurely, but the prospects are good. East Oriental is
installing double-decker cages preparatory to dropping
another 10 head of stamps (making 50). A “ head above
the intermediate level going north caused a hiatus in the
run of specimen stone, but good stuff is again being got
on the north side of the intruder. The bottom level, put
in to pick up the southerly dip of the lode, is near its
goal, and experienced men build hopes on the prospects
going south along the slide towards the diorite bar on the
boundary of the lease and in the direction of the Scottish
Gympie. No. 1 North Oriental, in its deep easterly dip
winze, has cut what is regarded as the East Oriental
formation, but (as in the case of East Oriental) the
“ glitter” is not expected until the bottom of the country
is reached. No. 2 South Great Eastern is said to have
given up the idea of getting traction engines to haul East
Oriental’s crushing-stuff to its own battery, owing to
improvements on No. 3 and Inglewood reefs, which have
enabled the putting on of another shift. On the Columbia
line, water troubles and machinery accidents retard pro-
gress, but Columbia Extended, No. 2 North Columbia and
No. 1 North Columbia hold out pretty solid hopes of
reward after long years of stringing-on. At the Two-
mile end Great Northern badly needs another reef,
and the one expected in the No. 1 western crosscut
islong overdue, though breastheads in the face still keep
Hope out of the coffin.

The old Anglo-Saxon, out north of O.K. (North
Queensland), has been in the hands of pioneer “ Jack
Munro, of 0.K., Tartana and Mitchell River, for the past
three or four years, and is likely to be heard of again
shortly. In the “goodold days”of English management,
the property returned something over 50,0000 z. gold, and
tradition has it that the local management had a royal
time. Munro’s idea is that the work was done on wrong
lines and with scant knowledge of mining principles. He
proposes to open up the property and annex the metal
left by the other folk. There is talk of a flotation.
* * • »
The Anglo-Saxon had an amazing career. The
original prospector was a German from Saxony ; Har-
board, still in Queensland, afterwards joined him hence
the name Anglo-Saxon. The first men simply knocked
gold out. Then a Cooktown man came in and the co.
was floated in London, and a 10-head battery was put up.
The first yields went about 9oz. to the ton, and 10s. in
dividends was paid right off. Shares (10s. paid) ran up to
£B. The mine was out-of-the-way ;it was beastly rich ;
and the management became demoralised. No reserves
were established ; and when the acting manager got off
the main reef at the Nos. 6 and 7 levels, there was no
money to carry on with, and the mine was abandoned.
R. L. Jack in 1897 or thereabouts made a report which
showed why the Nos. 6 and 7 levels didn’t get
the reef; instead of being driven south-west they were
driven one north-west and the other west. At two
points, nevertheless, the reef has been cut at these deeper
levels, but in neither was it payable. It was not, how-
ever, given a fair test at these depths, and a mine wnieh
produced such remarkable results down to the No. 5
level certainly deserves a bit more probing. The old bat-
tery has been long since removed, and most of the plant;
but the shafts, thougli full of water up to the 100 ft.
level, were well timbered, and should be in good condition.

Gilmore tin mine is giving another poor adver-
tisement for the erratic North Queensland lodes. After
making a great splash, production has fallen away to
almost nothing, and ore output now depends mainly on
developments in the 200 ft. level crosscut in the Dolly
Grey section and the 250 ft. crosscut now going in to seek
the Midas lode. The former has reached a point just
under where the lode was worked in the upper part of
the mine, and further prospecting may disclose a respect-
able body at any time. So far, small patches of rich ore
have been found, but nothing of any size. The Midas
lode was poor at the 200 ft. level, but something may be
got at the next level below, as at 200 ft. the lode, though
poor as a whole, was strong, well-defined, and with seams
of rich ore running through it. But, though the P ( d ssl "
bilities in these two quarters are at least fair, shareholders
have practically no hope of getting any more rich brown
ore worth speaking of, and it was this rich brown ore that
made the early' returns so sweet.
* * * *
In the newly-floated North Queensland tin-
show, the Tommy Burns, a number of rich shoots have
been opened up in sandstone and quartzite country. In
most cases, merely the loose surface stuff has been
stripped ; but, on what looks like the niain shoot, a shaft
has been sunk, which, at time of advices, was Bft. deep,
and showing 20 per cent, ore in the bottom. The slioots
will be found to be of a very patchy character, but there
are a fair number of them exposed—six or more and
from most of them from 15 to 20 per cent, ore, in small
quantities, can be broken. A first crushing of 49g tons
gave nearly 21 per cent., and, as far as one can see, one
or two more crushings of the same quality can be got out
after that, results will depend on developments. The
attempted float of the neighboring Cabbage Patch was
premature. Roos and Dempster’s lease has good pros-
pects in a small way ; six narrow seams, carrying patches
of 30 per cent, ore in profitable quantities, have been ex-
posed. The seams are never more than 18in. wide, but
they are consistently rich. A small party of men could
do well on the lease. The other leases in the group have
nothing heyond their proximity to T. Burns to recom-
mend them, no development having been done.
* * * *
W. J. Loring, of Bewick, Moreing and Co., who
has been up having a look at the Great Fitzroy (Q.), says
he likes the look of things well enough to recommend the
erection of another blast furnace, capable of dealing with
6000 tons a month. This would treble the present output.
As soon, however, as the new plant is in working order
8., M. & Co. propose to do a bit of local ore-buying.
« * * *
Th 9 competition between buyers of North
Queensland ores is just now pretty keen, and with many
of the smaller show’s unable to w'ork either copper or tin at
present prices, there is scarcely enough to go round. The
Queensland Copper Co., of Mount Perry’, is in the.field,
and the Chillagoe monopoly will be hit hard by this co.,
as well as by Mt. Molloy. Chillagoe is stated to have
just now more copper and lead ores than it can handle,
but indications don’t point to that satisfactory position
continuing. The general tendency is towards a decrease
of the district’s output. A few mines are shipping to
Mt. Molloy, but it is pretty certain that the present
smelting campaign on this plant will not last for three
months. The tin industry in the North is suffering from
the same complaint. The output is not increasing, and
the mighty Irvinebank itself is cutting dowrn expenses
by shortening hands. Some of the buyers, local and
foreign, are already finding it necessary to send their re-
presentatives further afield.
Things are in a very dead state at the over-
capitalised Stannary Hills (N.Q.). As The Bulletin
expected, the tunnel scheme, on which manager Nicholas
went nap, has been a failure ; and within a few’ weeks of
getting it through, the place had to shut dow’n. If the
Ivanhoe shaft had been pushed down with the money
which was put into the tunnel, prospects might have had
a streak or two of hope about them. Practically no ore
has been sent up during the past month or so, but the
mill has been kept going on old tailings ; and probably
the tailings are about as good as the ore lately available
—which doesn’t say much either for the mine as it stands
or for some of the mill work done in past times.

Between January and September Westralian
gold dividends amounted to £1,105,158, split up as fol-

cent, of the total is still paid out by five of the 17 contri-
buting cos., and as one of their number, the Fingall, must
shortly drop back, some other co. is w’anted to shoot out
of the ruck. But that co. is not in sight at present.
* * * *
Kalgurii (W. A.) looks well, so far, at 1550 ft.,
but as only 50ft. of driving has been done, it is rather
earlv to blow about prospects at this point. Meantime
enough profits to pay the present dividend and leave
something over for the reserve fund are being earned, and
the management wears a confident smile. The mine is
located on the edge of a very treacherous zone, and that
is enough to make shareholders timid every time a new
level is driven ; but there is no cause for alarm as yet.
* * * *
So far Great Boulder (W.A.) is worth
at 2350 ft., but a good stretch of country which forms
the heart of the shoot has yet to be broken. It does not
look, however, as if the width and values at this point
will come within cooee of those at 2200 ft. ; but then the
latter was an exceptional level, and will help to make up
for one or two ordinary or indifferent one 9, should they
be opened up.

Shareholders wore a glum expression at the
Golden Pole meeting, held at Kalgoorlie on the 7th inst.
Chairman Fimister regretted things were not better, but
reminded the few lugubrious shareholders present that
nothing in this world could last—which was mighty'cold
comfort. The co.’s hope now was the Koh-i-noor lease at
Magnet, and if, after spending a little more money in
development, the Board decided to turn it down, the
advisability of either distributing the £6OOO in hand
among shareholders or playing it up in developing
another property would be considered. To date the Pole
had produced £208,233 worth of gold, and paid £BO,OOO in
dividends ; but, he added, its star was now set. There
being no other business on hand, shareholders, at the
invitation of the chairman, damped their sorrow at the
nearest bar.
* * * *
8., M. and Co. have thrown up the option re-
cently taken by them over the Hannan’s Reward and
other north-end Kalgoorlie leases. Some fair assays were
obtained, but the property was not considered good
enough for the firm’s purpose.

Brown Hill Extended (W.A.) may be worked
on terms by Oroya-Brown Hill before very long. Nego-
tiations are now going on, and it looks as if they will
come together. As the Extended is no use share-
holders at present, and as “ working on terms ” is rarely
satisfactory to the general body of shareholders, what-
ever it may be to the directors, etc., the most sensible
thing to do would be to sell the show outright to the
Oroya-Brown Hill and have done with it. Shareholders
would be most likely to get something out of it that way.

Chaffers, Hannans Star, and Boulder Main Reefs
are still fashionable in the West. The London market is
being propped up by Australian buying, supplemented by
paper talk ; but, when the paper talk stops, Australian
speculators may begin to feel sorry for themselves. Mean-
time, London is a steady seller.
•* * * *
Golden Ridge (W.A.) has got its cyanide plant
in going order, and increased profits and dividends are
talked of. The reef continues of good width and value at
400 ft., and the fact that the shaft is being deepened to
500 ft. shows that the co. is not a dawdler, but is going to
learn the best or worst about the deeper ground. Mean-
time the cash balance is steadily mounting up, and regu-
lar quarterly dividends are being paid.
Sons of Gwalia (W.A.) still gets good develop-
ments in depth, and the directors have sleepless nights
trying to think what is best to be done. Some time back
the monthly output was brought down for the very good
reason that it couldn’t be kept up ; then, as prospects
improved a bit, it was lifted a thousand or two to pay for
new plant without cutting down the profit. Later on it
was lowered to £18,500, and it still hovers around that
figure. Now it is stated that fear of being twitted with
seesawing the return prevents the Board from putting it
up again. But there is still time for directors to muster
up a bit of courage before the meeting.

Gwalia South held its half-yearly meeting at
Kalgoorlie the other day, when Chairman Yeo talked
about improved prospects and increased prosperity. The
value of the new western shoot at No. 3 touched
upon, and the fact that “ directors’ fees, £376,” included
£294 accrued fees from May, 1905, to September, 1907,
was explained. Then Yeo talked finance. The co., he
said, had £B5OO in the bank and about £llOO worth of
concentrates and 3000 tons of 9s. slimes. A dividend
could be paid at once ; but as £5OOO had been ear-marked
for new treatment plant, the Board had decided to defer
the next dividend until December or January next, and
not run the co. short of ready cash for the sake of
“ window dressing.” As this policy was plainly sound,
those present smothered their greedy instincts, and ap-
plauded with as much enthusiasm as could be expected
in the circumstances.

It is now stated that Wiluna (W.A.) has a
future, if the mines there are worked in the right way and
by the right people. On the strength of this, an attempt
is about to be made to float a batch of new properties in
London. But J. Bull had better wait to see how Gwalia
Consolidated shareholders get on before undoing his
purse strings. That co. has kept going for some years on
the extraordinary faith of its backers, and the fact that
£32,500 has just been raised by the issue of 200,000 new
shares shows that the supply hasn’t run out yet. If,
however, the present effort to turn the concern into a
profitable one fails, the fall will be accompanied by a very
painful thud.

The management of the Phillips River Gold
and Copper Co. has changed hands. King has gone, and
one Hochschild has come. Soon after his arrival, Hochs-
child let something drop about wages, and, getting wind
of this, the union officials asked him to give an undertak-
ing in writing that he would not tinker with the present
rates for the next 12 months at least. Hochschild re-
fused, urging that he hadn’t been long enough in the
country to know w'hat is what. As a result, the workers
regard Hochschild and the German people he represents
with a lot of suspicion.

Peak Hill Goldfield, Ltd. (W.A.), has issued a
circular stating that applications have been received from
debenture holders for £10,004 of the £20,000 “ prior lien
bonds,” or just £4 more than the minimum amount on
which the Board undertook to go to allotment. Colonial
shareholders are now asked to apply for a portion of the
balance ; but the risk is much too great to recommend,
though as mere shareholders they are liable to be
squeezed out altogether.

Carr Boyd, that vigorous old battler in remote
places, wires from Laverton (W.A.) that his show in the
far-back Cosmo Newbery Ranges is panning out better
even than the previous mention of it (B. 8/10/’08) indi-
cated. The S£ tons which he packed in has, he says,
given 290 z. 17dwt. over the plates, and the tailings assay
12dwt.

When the miners struck at the Magnet (Tas.),
or when the miners were locked out—they can’t agree
which it was —Labor-member J. J. Long lodged an appli-
cation for the forfeiture of the North Magnet section, on
the ground of non-fulfilment of conditions. On June 20
the Warden recommended forfeiture, and on appeal to
the Mining Board that recommendation has now been up-
held. The North Magnet used to belong to a separate
co., but was transferred to the Magnet Co. to be held “ in
safe-keeping and trust by the Magnet Co. and to be re-
turned to the North Magnet Co. on request and payment
of money due to the Magnet Co.” The money wasn t
paid, and the lease remained in the Magnet Co.’s hands.
That co. never, however, got the lease consolidated with
the other holding, and so it incurred forfeiture. As there
is very little doubt that there is good ore in the block,
the loss is pretty severe ; and all the more severe because
the Magnet workings are right on the boundary.

The wolfram miners of the Woothakata elec-
torate (N.Q.) have mostly complained that they have
never got a fair price for their ore, and they have asked
the Government several times to help them in getting
fair values, but without success. “Micky” Woods, who
represents the district in the State Parliament, has made
himself busy over the matter, and has in consequence
been offered by a London firm of metal-buyers an agency
for the purchase of tin ore, molybdenite, and wolfram in
Queensland. As Woods will practically represent both
sides to the bargain, the miners reckon that at last they
may have a chance of seeing some of the way into the
inwardness of the business.

H. Gordon, now of Broken Hill. It contains the
best collection of Western aboriginal weapons and
relics in the country. There are nardoo stones
3ft. x 18m., boomerangs, wumeras, spears, nulla

from tip to tip, wonderfully carved walking-sticks,'
a model of the big Broken Hill mine that took 3b

* * Munkowurlie”: Don’t think ‘ ‘ W.D.T.’s ”
knowledge of sting-rays (B. 24/9/’08) is very ex-
tensive; anyway, a swimmer need not faint
because he happens to be in the same waters as a
half-ton’ray. Thedanger is more in wading through
shallow water than in swimming. The ’ray has a
habit of concealing himself just below the sand,
and making a disagreeable fuss when trodden
upon. iWhen cockle-hunting on the coast of St.
Vincent’s Gulf (S.A.), some time ago, I got on
top of a vigorous specimen which lifted me about
a foot. Afterwards I found a slitjin the leg of my
pants, about six inches long, where the barb had
entered and torn itself out. These barbs, which
lie along the tail, vary from 4in. to Min. in
length. Some of the beasts have two or three
barbs. They are villainous weapons, with a
sharp, saw-like edge, and covered with a beastly
slime. When the ’ray stabs, he bends his tail
underneath, drives the weapon home, and ex-
tricates it with a circular sweep which cuts the
surroundings like a knife.

“ The Prooshan ” : The unfortunate wom-
bat has given birth to a fresh litter of fairy tales
lately, and it’s time a little sober truth got into
action re methods of capture. When I was a
youngster we used to go up the miners’ races,
away back in the hills, mostly of a Sunday, when
no mining was going on. Having found a wombat
hole, we dammed the race, dug a gutter to the
mouth of the hole of the ’bat, and then with axes,
picks, shovels, and bludgeons, we waited results.
With the large inflow at command, we soon
flooded the hole, and presently the bubbles at the
entrance foretold the coming of our prey. The
excitement was intense. And when, a few
moments later, the brute burst out like a Hawkes-
bury settler from his flooded camp, thirteen imple-
ments of smash hit him in thirteen different
places at once, making him feel like a bruised
Baltic fleet. As soon as his hide was taken off,
and that was no easy accomplishment, the race
was repaired, and we went in search of a fresh
quarry. There were plenty along the races, as
miners knew to their sorrow. When hunting on
week days a strong watch was told off along the
race to keep a look-out for diggers, who seemed
annoyed whenever we stopped their water supply.
“ The Prooshan ” on a wet day :
There is no better gauge of human selfishness than rain.
I met a man once, the day after a 3in. fall had
crippled a mild drought. “Grand rain,” I said ; “just
set things right again.” “Grand rain!” he grunted.
‘ Yes, grand rain for me all right! I had a man closing
to-day for my 400-acre paddock on Moore’s Point-one
hundred lovely quids for six months, and down comes the
rotten rain yesterday, and, of course, he don’t turn up
to-day. Grand rain for me ! Lovely rain ! ” And then
he wanted to know what was the good of blank}' rain
coming then, anyway, as it would be too late to do any
good, and very likely give us a dry autumn, and make it
a perishin’ brute of a winter.
Some men enthuse over rain up to a certain limit,
and go about in the nip of changed temperature with
both hands in their pockets, and back and shoulders
humped, as if they were gentlemen of leisure, till the
weather clears up. They chortle over the “ lovely earthy
smell, the lovely change,” and declare it’s “ like a new
world.” After an hour or two they wonder “whether it’s
a general rain,” and reckon Tom Somebody out West
“ ’ll have a grin on him if it is.” Then the rain yarns set
in all along the verandah, and we learn that Bob Mclntyre
of Oura station, near Worga, once got into his house tank
when the rain came after a drought, and stayed there till
the water rose to his chin.
After two days’rain these enthusiasts wonder “when
the bloomin’rain’s goin’t’stop,” and reckon “enough’s
as good as a feast.” They growl about the spuds getting
the second growth, and the hail spoiling the fruit. The
roof (which has leaked pretty badly) drops in for a bad
time, and is called rotten, and the man who built the
house is called rotten.
Should the rain continue another day, the women
start talking about the dirty, filthy weather, and
want to know what’s the good o’ trying to keep floors
clean when people trapsin’ in with tons o’mud on their
boots all day. The wood is wretched, soggy stuff, and
won’t burn ; the little brute of a black pig has been on to
the back verandah, sniffin’after the scraps and spoilt all
the lovely fuchsias put out to get a drink, to say nothing
of the lovely little daphne that was “ just beginning to
grow.” The children are told “to clear off to the shed or
somewhere out o’ mischief, for Heaven’s sake,” and
there’s mostly a terrier that ’ll “have his blessed neck
broken if he’s caught on the bed again with his muddy
feet."
Should a fourth day’s rain ensue, there’s mostly a
tragedy of some kind on the farm.

“ Stony ” : It was a fine, dry, dusty sum-
mer evening, and William Barslop sat in the
shelter of the oleander tree. The hot, dry wind
blew through his whiskers; his tongue was dry,
and he felt as though there was fur upon his soul.
The parcels of his late afternoon’s shopping lay
upon the bench by the kitchen door, and William
sat beneath the oleander and perspired freely.
Aimlessly he felt through the pockets of his faded
vest. Suddenly he sat upright and a look of
glad surprise dawned in his eyes. He brought
forth a shilling and stared at it, his thoughts run-
ning backwards. This was not the vest he had been
wearing lately, he remembered. Then he arose,
planted his parcels behind the oleander, and dis-
appeared through the back-ga,te. Some time
later he arrived, with dewy whiskers and a more
cheerful expression, and picked up the parcels.
Mrs. Annetta Barslop met him at the back-door.
“An’ did y’ get th’clo’es pegs?” she demanded.
“Yes, I did,” said Barslop, “an’ I got th’
pepper, ’n’ th’ pair o’ stockin’s, ’n’ the
medicine, ’n’ th’ condensed milk, ’n’ that’s
the lot —makin’ th’ amount y’ give me this
mornin’.” Mrs. Annetta Barslop fixed him with
a piercing eye. “ An’ there was th’ shillin’ I give
y’ for the meat for to-morro’.” William Barslop
opened his mouth, turned pale, said “ Oh—er—”
and thought better of it. His wife leant forward
and sniffed. “Beer!” she exclaimed, passionately,
“Beer!” On the word, William Barslop shrank
back and dived for the back-gate, a torrent of ver-
biage racing upon his heels as he stumbled, with
bent head, before the storm, and fled down the
right-of-way into the gathering gloom.

“Quail”: “Whaffor” (B. 17/9/’08) re-
marks that prickly pear has points. It has. At
Dulacca (Q.) nearly all the scrub land has been
taken up, and the pear country, at which land-
seekers used to shy like 4 ’Jimmie Banni-
kin’s” horse when'he met Soottee Ilham’s
camel drinking up the Darling River, is now
being noticed. This is making some of the
folk thereabouts reminisce. During the
drought, an oxen-persuader named Jackson,
seeing no prospect of making a living out of
bullock-punching, turned his team into the
pear to live or die, and went elsewhere to
look for toil. About nine months after-
wards he came back and asked for the loan
of a horse to look for the cattle. His sanity
was doubted, but he got the horse, and
came back with his bullocks, which were
scarcely able to walk through their excessive
stummick girth. About the same time a
dairy farmer, who had neither grass nor
water for his heifers, turned them into the
pear. A couple of months later, hearing that
they were doing well, he asked the manager
of a near-by station to go out with him
and have a look at them. The manager re-
fused, as he reckoned he could see enough
dead stock on the station without going into
the pear country. Two months later he was
again asked to go, and this time he went,
and found the heifers in good trim. When
the drought was at its worst, 500 of the
poorest of the Dulacca station cattle were
put into a small paddock, and fed on
scorched pear. Not one died, and when
the drought broke, nearly a year later, they
were in splendid condition.
“ Dandalup ” : Re prickly pear. I heartily
agree with “Whaffor” (B. 17/9/’08) when he re-
marks that “the prickly pear has its points.”
Yes, it has ! Was once accelerated over a six-rail
fence by a masculine cow, and landed fair in the
middle of a clump of the Queensland curse. Took
some considerable time to scramble out, and
afterwards found that it had so many points that
it took me some weeks to discover them all. But,
seriously, the “curse” can be utilised. A Bris-
bane chemist has discovered that an excellent
white spirit can be distilled from the plant—
about seven gallons per ton. The refuse, after
the spirit has been obtained, may be made up into
good straw-board, or pulp suitable for the manu-
facture of linoleum, papier-mache, etc. A valuable
and nutritious feed-cake for cattle and horses can
also be made up from the waste, at about half the
cost of the present article, and just as good, if not
better. Also, fairly good sugar is a possibility.
The question of the future is, “ Is the pear really
a curse ? ”
“P. Pan”: “Machete’s” observation
(B. 17/9/’08) that Reynard has appeared well up
in Queensland is not very extraordinary. The fox
has not only spread well up into the far north of
S. Australia, but to the south as well, and the
Adelaide suburban inhabitant occasionally has a
wild and exciting time tearing the red gentleman
off the poultry. Almost any day foxes can be seen
around the Adelaide foothills, and their spread
during the last few years has been enormous. The
fox treats poultry much the same way as it does
lambs. This shocking imported intruder kills the
proud leghorn rooster for the sake merely of the
gore that flows out of its severed neck, and the
body is left severely alone. A costly individual
to board is the brown cuss.

That people bathing in the sea
In godly countries must appear
Completely gowned from neck to knee.
The chieftain was amazed. Said he :
“ I’ll legalise that custom here ! ”
When Lord Devine, the time to kill,

“ Mate ” : The Bulletin (20/8/’08) put its
welcome to the White Armada in semaphore
letters, and I hope it is an indication that it is going
to take up the question of signalling. There are
quite a number of flag-waggers on our coast ships
these days ; but, for want of a little organisation,
their energy is largely wasted. So far it is purely
Private Enterprise, and needs a little State inter-
ference before it will be of much advantage. Some
of the lighthouse-keepers will take Morse signals
—Rottnest (W.A.), Wilson’s Promontory (Vic.),
Green Cape (N.S.W.), and Cape Cleveland (Q.)
are examples. They seem to rather like it, and
it must lend an interest to their monotonous lives.
When the Commonwealth takes over the light-
houses it could make signalling a part of the
ordinary routine without unduly burdening the
keepers. In lighthouses connected by telegraph
they needs must know the code and keep a look-
out night and day ; so that to take a signal would
not be a great matter. Already some of
the companies show a special signal,
which has to be answered and re-
ported. It would be much more
satisfactory for everyone to have
ships reported by name than
merely as “a steamer,” even
if the company’s name is added.
The Commonwealth navy —
when it arrives—would find it a
great advantage to be able to
talk to the coasters night or
day. Also, it makes for the
quicker and more accurate re-
porting of accidents or unusual
disturbances. The present exams.
for masters and mates require a
knowledge of both Morse and sema-
phore signalling; but without some incen-
tive and opportunity to practise, this learn-
ing soon goes with much of the other matter
crammed for exam, purposes. Ten minutes a
day will keep you up to ordinary signalling
speed, but that can only be obtained where
there are two enthusiasts on the same ship.
If The Bulletin can find space to give a
list of ships with flag-waggers on board, it
will be a great help. Here are some vessels
that will be pleased to talk to fellow waggers :
Riverina, Yon gal a, Grantala, Coorna, Pere-
grine, Period, Chillagoe, Sydney, Melbourne, and
New Guinea.

“Milky White”: Appreciations of the
native acacias abound in Australian literature, the
golden and silver wattles being especially favored
by our bards, and the violet-scented myall by
prose-writers. To me the beauty of the family is
the acacia leprosa. It is known on the West
Gippsland ranges as the native hickory. Isolated
specimens 20ft. high may be seen in places, but it
delights most in a thick, scrubby growth not
half that height. Sometimes at the feet of
patriarchal gums, twining its arms round
its grand uncle, the blackwood, and mocking
its big brother, the tan-wattle, it covers whole
hillsides and valleys, and when the blossoms of
the wattles and the blackwoods begin to wilt it
shows them how to bloom. Flowering later than
they, it is richer in color, and compared with it
the golden wattle blossom is as flaxen hair to red

gold tresses touched with sunlight. The lower
branches generally lift slim arms upward, lithe
arms bangled all the way down with coppery gold,
like that which hides inside the boronia bells;
but the topmost shoots form fairy arches of yellow
glory that the spiders never seem to tire of bind-
ing together with gossamer. See the native
hickory thus on a warm spring morning, with the
sun playing color tunes on web-snared rain-drops,
and if you don’t forget breakfast time—well,
you’re no poet. I hereby put in a claim for the
native hickory to be awarded first place amongst
all the acacias for wealth and beauty of bloom.
“Gil”: I have just awakened from a
brown study, and 1 want to know if everybody in
the N.S.W. Back Country is named Brown.
When I went unsuspectingly to book my passage
on a Darling River (N.S.W.) liner for a distant
port of call I found that three of the captains
were named Brown. Next I called on a Western
newspaper editor ; his name was Brown. Later
on I picked up a mate on the lonely Louth-to-
Cobar track ; he, too, was Brown. He had a dog
whereof the name was Brown. Brown, it seems,
called it after a sensible and satisfactory person.
The sensible and satisfactory person’s name was
Brown. Besides, he said, the name that was
good enough for him was good enough for his dog.
1 had a sweetheart Out West once. Brown wasn’t
her name. But she is married now, and is Mrs.
Brown. It serves her right.

“The Prooshan ” : Hitherto Bulletin
wombat specialists have overlooked an undoubted
virtue the animal exhibits in alluvial mining dis-
tricts. He rakes the gold out into the light of
day, and many a digger has located the run of
goid by taking a dish of wash from the mouth of
womby’s tunnel. Next to the wombat as a gold
revealer ranks the tree that kicks up its heels and
a deal of the auriferous country in the act of fall-
ing to mother earth.
“ Ifcan ” : The naturalists and botanists of
Australia should combine to bring about order in
the nomenclature of our. fauna and flora. At
present contusion does not express the position.
The diamond snake of Tasmania is harmless;
the diamond snake of Australia is exceedingly
venomous. The carpet ditto of Australia is
only venomous at certain periods of the
year; the Tasmanian carpet is most
deadly. The alligators of Queensland and
the Territory are crocodiles, for in the
latter man-eater the fourth mandibular
tooth fits into a notch in the upper
jaw; in the alligator it dovetails into a
pit; besides, there are other marked
differences. Our porcupines have little
in common with the real mackay.
The Australian salmon is not a sal-
mon, and his lordship the sehnapper
is known by another name in Queens-
land, while they call a different fish
a sehnapper in that part. White ants
are not ants. The night cuckoo is
not a cuckoo, but an owl. Our ’pos-
sum is a phalanger ; Australia is sup-
posed to possess nine different sorts
of ’possum, and there is no ’possum
among the lot. The perch in Queens-
\ land is not the same fish as the perch
\ in the southern States. The silver
/ bream of Melbourne is a white
bream in Sydney and a grunter in
Queensland. The bandicoot is not
entitled to that name, for the Indian
people centuries ago gave it to an
entirely different bloke. Three differ-
ent sorts of tree are called silky oak
in North Queensland, and not any one
of them is like the tree of the same
name in South Queensland and N.S. W.
Pencil cedar in N.S.W. is maple in
Queensland. As to hardwoods, each
district has its own names. Botanist
Bailey has done something to unravel the tangle
in the North, but he gets mighty little support
from his brother vegetable and beetle hunters.

This, from “Gilrooney,” seems too con-
fused for the sporting page :
A confused disturbance raged with much violence in
the new stadium at Oobar (N.S.W.), on Eight Hour Day
night, between “Ranji” Burns, of Sydney, and Robbie,
the Tasmanian middle-weight, for a purse of £5O. Burns
knocked Robbie down in the fourth round. He remained
down for about two minutes, but as soon as he arose the
referee ordered them to fight on. In the next round
Robbie went down again, and somebody (the Lord only
knows who) skied his towel. Then Burns collapsed in a
swoon, and confusion ran amok. It afterwards tran-
spired that there were three official referees, and as each
one in the audience of 1000 seemed to have also appointed
himself referee, there were exactly 1003 referees all re-
fereeing together at the finish of the chaos. The final
decision wasn’t given until next day. And the average
Cobar man in the street isn’t quite sure yet who scooped
the £5O and the bundle of glory.
The Society of Artists.
Without a single “big” work in it, the second
annual exhibition of the Secessionists is the most
distinctive art show yet seen in Sydney. Here
are ideas—crude, tentative, inchoate, youthful, yet
fermenting, alive. The Secessionists form no
separate, strongly differentiated school; they
differ among themselves more even than they
differ from all other shows. They are a band of
individualists, each intent upon his special
vision, each striving to realise his view of Aus-
tralia by his own self-taught methods, each by
different paths groping his way toward a national
art. The Secessionists have something to say, and
are gasping to say it.
There is really no need for that bigness in art
which expresses itself in acres. The Secessionists
have found out that to do a little thing well is to
do a big thing ; and as there are no vast attempts
there are no bulky failures. The space that
might have been given to large areas of the
squashy stuff that is squeezed out of tubes, is
saved for artistically bigger things. Also—but
this a prosaic parenthesis—the Secessionists have
found that large canvases are not bought in
Australia.
The main feature of the show is the general
high level of the exhibits. The judges have re-
jected with a more than usually heavy thud.
That the Society is alive and lush is apparent
from the fact that this year a number of new-
comers proffer panels of distinct promise—in one
or two cases of distinct achievement; while more
than one of the younger members of the Society
record a marked step in advance. W. Hardy
Wilson sends from the other hemisphere, where
he is absorbing the ideas of Constable, Brangwyn
and Corot, a striking collection of landscapes, rich,
broadly massed and sombrely colored. Evidences
of the influence of the three artists named are
apparent in his work ; but he has the right land-
scape feeling and the capacity to delineate it.
E. Griiner is another of the new-comers to show
promise. His painting of sunlight sparkling on
foliage is sheer cleverness, and his impressionistic
methods are amply justified in at least two
of his smaller studies. H. Griffiths, too,
possibly possesses, concealed on his person, that
vague thing called a future; though the evidences
upon which to base this assumption are too slight
for complete confidence. He is infected with
ideas—some of them, at present, too big for his
brush ; but his breadth of treatment and his
drawing are assets not lightly to be disregarded.
Among the younger members who have pro-
fited most by this year’s work, Miss McWhannell
shows in her landscapes a broadness of treatment
and a masculine strength that lift her out of the
student class. Her pictures “carry” admirably.
Her “Pumpkin Field” is sturdy and satisfying
work. Miss Viola Quaife’s decorative instinct is
this year married to a new surety of touch.
Miss M. G. Nicoll’s charming and humorous child
studies show how short-sighted Ward, Lock and
Co. are in not at once capturing her to illustrate
all the Turner sisters’ Australian child stories, at
present illustrated shockingly. Some striking
black-and-white illustrations by Miss Nellie Rodd
show a fine sense of composition. The judges,
however, have been too kind to Miss Jacobs.
Douglas Fry, as usual, has a mob of admirably
drawn mokes. Ruby Winckler’s book-plates are
interesting, but her frieze is a bit too lively to
live with. Harry Julius shows imagination and
the decorative instinct. Miss F. Rod way is hereby
advised to stick to black-and-white. She can do
the strong thing so admirably in this medium that
it seems quite unnecessary for her to adventure
(and fail) in the perilous field of oils. She has not
yet learnt the meaning of atmosphere.
Of the older men, Sid Long, as usual, sends a
large assortment of the sort of Australian land-
scape that he, and he alone, does so well. He is
as brilliant and poetical as ever—also as careless.
And he is still fatally lured by the nude. In his
“Reflections ” he presents us with a lady who has
red legs and a stone bosom. But in his smaller
landscapes he shows his special poetical insight
and his individual manner in all its well-known
charm. Julian Ashton has unkindly turned the
caricaturist’s pencil upon a pained “Hop” ; but
his child-study is recognised as good stuff, the
obvious heightening of the color of the child’s lips
being admittedly part of his convention in
order to get his effect. Ashton’s landscapes
are varied, all judicious and solid work,
many of them charming. Howard Ashton’s big
picture is a “ break-away ” ; but Howard is yet
young enough to feel restive. It is well done—a
difficult subject conscientiously handled, but un-
interesting. His smaller landscapes are, as usual,
excellent. Hans Heysen’s “ Timber Hauling ”
gives us real eucalypts in a real atmosphere. This
unobtrusive picture merits careful examination.
J. F. Scott shows a couple of fine decorative
effects. As for D. H. Souter, one can imagine
himself saying “ I will have ideas ! ” And he has
them. One shows a strong mermaid supporting a
balanced acrobat by one arm, He terms it, with
characteristic humor, “ The Diver.” Lionel
Lindsay’s large collection of vivid landscapes are
original in composition, but in color they are crude,
and in treatment too harsh. His etchings, of
course, are altogether pleasing ; and these, with a
few of bis water-colors, redeem his vista of metallic-
looking oil-sketches.
The astonishing J. J. Hilder forwards a score of
impressions, confirming the estimate formed of
him at his first appearance last year. His subtle
appreciation of color—each picture is a Whistler-
like harmony in one prevailing hue—is a thing too
rarein Australia not to need cherishing. Hisrender-
ing of delicate nuances of color is almost Japanese,
and only here and there —notably in the picture
of a transparent boat upon an opaque river—does
he go wrong. His method is entirely his own,
and in his hands it is the only right method.
And in the work of Norman Lindsay we have the
statement that in art Australia is Parisian. The
subject matters nothing so long as the effect
reached is that which the artist set out to gain ;
and Norman Lindsay’s genius never allows him to
go wrong. His two large black-and-whites are,
of course, the finest things in the show. They
would, for excellence of technique, imaginative
conception and sense of composition, be hard to
match among the work of the living artists of the
world. And yet there are critics who, being
unable to tell him how to draw, presume to tell
him what to draw !
A delightful surprise is a little grey English
“ Streeton ”; while from London comes the
evidence that Thea Proctor has immensely im-
proved by her venture abroad. She exhibits a
quite satisfying decorative design which, in
addition to containing a portrait of George
Lambert, shows the influence that that artist has
over her work ; while her painting on silk for a
fan, obviously “after” the Australian, Conder,
the recognised fan-painter of England, is a thing
of beauty.

ary evidence, to credit your yarn as to the Mirboo
Racing Club’s intention to start each race with prayer....
The Wasp : Your tribute to the memory of the late Victor
Daley (peace to his soul) has the merit of unusualness,
anyhow :
Called hence in the prime of life,
And the zenith of his literary fame,
Readers of notable poems
Praise the late poet’s name.
He sleeps in the gardens of peace
Down by the glistening sea,
Where the south breezes Whisper and sigh
O’er his sacred sepulchre.
F.H.F. : The “amusing incident” that you wit-
nessed “ a short while back out west” was observed and
recorded by someone else—in fact, a whole horde of them
—years and years ago... .Hooka : Your name is Moore,

“ Haw ! I say, Maw, weren’t you in the Baw waw V It

Would have been delighted to use the joke if we could
have found it.. ..Garbutt: Done to death Nero: You
haven’t made much of a blaze this time. And yet all your
subjects were old and dry enough Loco: Work very
fair ; but the theme has been often treated in the same
mock-heroics J.O’M.: Your 14 long verses on sleeping
out in the park have one redeeming feature—yqu don't
try to rhyme “dawn ” and “morn.” You deftly dodge it
by calling what the hero slept on “ the Almighty’s lawn.' 1
Still, even that ingenuity can’t save it... .E.V.R. : “A
few stanzas begotten of half-an-hour's idleness” read like
that —easy, jiggety-jig, four-a-penny rhymes A.K.R. :
“ Bagpipes ” no good ; the other not good enough, except
in patches.... H. M. Childers: Cricket T. Jackson:
Too long for print. Best plan is to get into communica-
tion with the Commission that will shortly be appointed.
Annie: No value....Tike: Very fairly written;
but why don’t you get on to a subject about
which you’ve got special local knowledge?
Ellon C. (M.L.): Don’t recall “ Reunited,” but if it was
unaccompanied by stamps it is probably no more....
E.J.M. : Interesting in itself, but too technical for the
general reader J.O.E. : Good for a beginning. Try
again... .S. J.C.: The rhyme and metre are good. Other-
wise, there’s nothing in it....C0m0: Your touch isn’t
light enough C.H.G. : Needed more literary skill to
do it justice Gerald B.: Your usual mediocrity ...
E.8.H.: It has clever touches, but does not impress u 9
as a whole.... The Wasp: “The Insane Tramp” and
“ The Last Moments of Dahlia ” (death-bed scene) are be-
low Corres. Col. level, but “ The Haunted House ” is im-
pressive. A stanza :
Nobody will live in the old brick house,
’Tis accurst with spectral gloom,
Raging for revenge—-as Shakspeare says—
The dead can’t rest in the tomb.
Nobody will live in the old brick house,
Though situated near Melbourne town ;
The owner’s only hope to get rid of the ghost
Is to pull the old house down.
J.A.L.: Joke re some grog being better than other grog,
etc., was a favorite with Moses when in waggish mood.
Let it lapse Patience: (1) Your right to sue for a
divorce in N.S.W. does not depend upon a certain period
of residence, but upon a question of “domicile.” Resi-
dence does not necessarily mean domicile, for a person
may be domiciled in N.S.W. without ever having resided
there. A petitioner, whether husband or wife, must
prove a domicile in N.S.W. before he or she can succeed
in a suit either for a divorce or judicial separation. Having
once become domiciled in N.S.W. the petitioner does not
lose that domicile ipso facto by being temporarily absent
from N.S.W., or even permanently absent, unless with
the intention of giving up that domicile and taking
another. Sorry we can’t define “ domicile ”in this
column ; it would take too much space.

Do you
realize
the immense importance of the unique
superiority of Odol? While all other
preparations for cleansing the mouth
and teeth are effective only during the
few moments of application, the anti-
septic and refreshing power of Odol
continues gently but persistently for
hours afterwards. Odol penetrates into
the interstices of the teeth and the
mucous membrane of the mouth, to a
certain extent impregnating them, and
thus securing a safeguard and preserva-
tive for the teeth such as no other denti-
frice can provide, not even approximately.

ITEMS
David Syme, of the Age, missed the mil-
lion mark after all. His estate is valued at
£929,481.
A certain Mr. F. D. A. Korff died at
Manly (N. 8. W.) last week, aged 58 years. The
Korffs were interested in shipping in Sydney
away back in the ’thirties of last century, when
Korff and Co. were building ships at Miller’s
Point. One of the family discovered the water
now known as Coffs Harbor, “Coff ” being an easy
corruption of the original name. The Korff who
has just died was for many years connected with
the Lands Department, and was at one time
State Lands agent at Albury.
A Sydney newspaper, recently noting the
old Sydney compositor, Mr. F. J. McOrath,
78, and still able to snatch type with the best,
re-states the ancient error that George Howe, the
St. Kitts Creole, was the first Australian printer.
Apart from the debated question as to whether a
Creole is a man of color, George Howe was not
the first printer. He was the first to produce a
newspaper, but years- before Howe arrived
the “Governor’s Orders” were put in type and
published by a man named Hughes.
“Jimmy” Iriglis, Sydney’s deceased
“Maori,” had many joyous days in his 63
years, for he was a gaily-dispositioned money-
hunter j but his liveliest was the occasion when
Parkes made him Ministerfor Education. Jimmy’s
exaltation of spirit took Parliament’s breath away.
He beat Parkes hollow in narrating funny stories.
“Mr. Hinglis,” said Parkes reprovingly from
behindthechampagneglassononeoccasion, “that’s
a disgraceful story to circulate about any man.”
“ But it puts the hero in such a humorous quan-
dary,” explained Jimmy exuberantly. “ Perhaps
it does,” said Parkes, sternly, “ but remember Hi
ham the ’ero of that hincident.”
Tom Harry, joint author with “Sudden ”
Solomon of the Stinking Fish book mentioned
B. 8/10/’OB, writes re the reference to Kingston:—
I was commenting on the insincerity and wild extrava-
gance of the local presson the occasion of the Kingston
funeral. I wrote : “It happened to rain a little on the
morning of the funeral, and the penny-a-line scribes at
once seized the opportunity to declare that ‘ the very
heavens wept with grief,’ and that ‘ the people in the
streets spoke to one another only in whispers and with
bated breath.’ ” This I characterised as blatant tommyrot.
My contention is, I think, to some extent supported by
the dismal fact that an exceedingly prosperous people
has refused to contribute'anything substantial towards a
memorial to one who is generally regarded as the greatest
statesman South Australia has produced.
“Samey ” from Victoria :
/ •l^ Var )F ”, J 8 wron B' in his biography of Isaiah Pearce
(with a c ), mayor of Ballarat East. Isaiah knows all
about extracting: ffold from the earth, but the ancient
and amazing: butter-and-rabbit caravan which “ Wane ”
describes was never his. It was old Richard Pearse (with
an s ), mayor of Ballarat West, who shoved that vener
able cathedral-upon-wheels along the dusty roads in days
of old, and bought the chooky-hen which the local small
boy brought out upside down and full of bitter protest.
George Collins Levey, at one time pro-
prietor of the Melbourne Herald, when it was a
morning paper, also M.L.A. for Normanby in the
sheep interest, and subsequently secretary for
many exhibitions in London and elsewhere, has
lost his wife. She was his second venture,
daughter of George Parker, of Washington
(ILS.A.), and widow of J. E. Bouligney, member
of Congress for New Orleans. His first wife was
a daughter of C. W. Ligar, a former Surveyor-
General of Victoria. He married her in 1863.
Professor Lowrie, who used to be the
State’s agricultural expert in S. Aus., and lately
has been explaining to Canterbury (M.L.) how to
grow the mangel wurzel and cultivate the tame
oat, has been appointed Director of Agriculture
in Westralia at £lOOO a year. Lowrie is probably
a very good man at his business, but the fact that
he is Premier Newton Moore’s brother-in-law is
pretty certain to add something to the Govern-
ment s troubles when the Labor party gets to
work shortly in the Assembly.
“Jimmy” Inglis, merchant and N.S.W.
ex-Minister of Education, who died suddenly in
Sydney last week, probably clipped years off his
life through his utter inability to stick to his last.
He always had to be doing something else. Some-
times it was book-writing ; oftener it was mine-
speculating. Lately two of his bigger mine specs
turned out a great worry. One was the Hillgrove
Proprietary, which shut down suddenly a fort-
night or so ago in great financial distress ; Inglis
had four or five thousand shares in that. He
might have sold them for nearly £1 each ; but he
hung on to the whole pack. The other, the Har-
bor Collieries Co., was a bigger worry still; for he
was Australian chairman of that, and it shut
down unexpectedly, too, and in financial distress.
He was a cheerful joker, but he hated to see his
plans go all wrong, and was greatly worried about
these two things. But for that he might easily
have pulled through what at first didn’t look a
serious illness.
A Christchurch man discourses :
An unusual sort of human show is Felix Tanner, of
M.L. He started from Wanganui, a while back’ to
circumnavigate the world in a barrel or something. The
barrel, or whatever it was, afterwards became known to
fame as “ Tanner’s Ark.” But the arkist struck trouble
around Cook’s Strait, and was only saved from the maw
ofjDavid Jones by an obliging steamer, which towed his keg
into Lyttelton. He has since made persistent attacks on
the prolonged fasting record—whereby he has frequently
reduced himself to skin and bone. His longest foodless
period was 40 days. His latest proposal is to fast (under
strict medical supervision) for an indefinite length of
time—presumably longer than 40 days—with water as the
only item on his bill of fare. Further, he has ideas about
doing without the drinking water and living entirely on a
course of saltwater baths. He wants to demonstrate that
shipwrecked mariners, on a raft, have both food and drink
handy if they only knew it. That is to say, he believes
that a man can live almost indefinitely on water, water
being really food ; and he also believes that he can soak
up all the water he requires, using his hide as a filter and
condenser, and thus give his mouth a complete rest.
What the shipwrecked folk are to do if there are sharks
about, the remarkable keg-mariner doesn’t explain.

Melb. : Even Jewry was astounded
when it heard that Nat Levi had left £54 000 He
always made a poor mouth. There seemed to be
poverty in his rasping tones. The look of a bit-

Synagogue never asked him for anything. Sir
Peter Teazle said of Charles Surface : “I never
grudged him—my advice.” And so with Nat
Nats advice was always at the Synagogue’s

statement.
Remarks by this paper’s Oldest Inhabitant:
Buckhurst, an ancient and somewhat historic mansion
at Double Bay (N.S.W.), has been demolished. Over half
a century ago Frederick Tooth lived there, at a time when
none of the Tooths were absentees. Then followed E. D.
Ogilvie, M.L.C., who owned Yugilbar, an immense prol
perty on the Clarence. In the early ’seventies George
Cheeke, nephew and associate to Mr. Justice Cheeke of
racing fame, was the tenant of Buckhurst. George
Cheeke married a daughter of William Long, and thus
became brother-in-law to Mrs. James Martin, the Chief
Justice’s widow, and Mrs. W. B. Dailey. After the death
of Justice Cheeke, Mr. and Mrs. Cheeke went to England
and hung out the social shingle at Cheltenham, where
George died a couple of years since. His widow is still
an absentee. W. A. Brodribb, a pioneer of many
States, one-time member for Brighton (Vic.), and again
an M.L.A. of New South Wales, gave the house a turn
He was followed by George Frederick Want (an elder
brother of Jack’s). Sydney Want, a younger than Jack
ensued next. Then came Mr. Holmes S. Chipman of
mercantile fame. Mrs. A. E. Francis had a turn at’the
house. Severne, a grazier, came next; and later
Mrs. Fred Want returned to it. Then John T. Toohey
the big brewer, got it, and now the house-smashers have
it. A brewer at the beginning and a brewer at the end !

“10-2-4 ” in reply :—-
Re “One-Three-Six” (B. 15/10/’08). In tipping either
Alexander Gordon or Adrian Knox as “ probables ” for
the N.S.W. Chief-Justice stakes, I merely stated what is
common Bar rumor. Shand is a brand-new and unex-
pected candidate. The idea of him would appeal as
humorous to the average barrister. He has been a K.C.
but a short while, his practice is nothing out of the way"
and his alleged “ dignity ” is of the sort that at times
trends perilously on pompousness. Cullen is a sound
lawyer, but has no other qualification. Gordon is
dismissed by “One-Three-Six” as “prosy” and
Knox as “dapper.” They are phrases which strike
me as meaningless in this connection. Gordon
is prosy, possibly, when he deals with a certain
class of Equity case. So would G. H. Reid be in
like circumstances. So would George Lauri or the late
Joseph Miller. As to the fatal “ dapperness ”of Knox,
I will trouble “ One-Yhree-Six ” to indicate to me a more
dapper man in this State than the present “Chief”—
unless it he his brother Judge, G. B. Simpson. Dapper-
ness is a common trait in Judges. I have observed some
oversea lawgivers—Hawkins, Russell of Killowan, and
others—who were dapper as men could be, and were none
the worse for it on the Bench. Wade, as “ One-Three-
Six ” notes, is, of course, impossible as C. J. (though there
is no knowing what a man may do for himself when ■
he tries); and Wise’s opportunity has vanished for
many terms. But I join issue violently with “ One-
Three-Six ”in re G. H. Reid. His undoubtedly great
effort in the Crick case has been expatiated
upon by admirers to weariness. They omit, for
the most part, to mention two important facts: (1)
It was his first and last achievement of the kind. (2) He
had Crick’s fine brain, saturated as it was with every
detail of the case, behind him from start to finish. The
counsel that could go wrong in those circumstances is in
a bad way. It is unlikely that G.H.R. will ever attain a
front row seat in the profession. He took to it too late
in life. He has not the true lawyer’s habit of mind.
“Master of suavity and sarcasm” though he is, he
manages all too often to tire Judges and to rub juries the
wrong way. He is a gamble ;he may turn up trupips or
he may be an astonishing failure. Certainly, “ within his
limitations,” he is a strong man.; but they are such
narrow limitations.
As a limpet or barnacle Bent
will take some scraping off. He has
been Vic. Minister of Railways con-
tinuously since June, 1902; but of
his original salaried colleagues only
the two sobersides, J. M. Davies and
farmer Cameron, remain with him—
as ballast, as it were. Shiels and
Robert Reid are dead, Irvine is in
another place, Taverner is in Lon-
don, Murray was frozen out, and
McKenzie was smoked out. Since
then Gillott and Kirton have come
in and gone out; Sachse has arrived
and stays, in spite of powerful hints ;
Langdon has popped up and down
again ; and McLeod, Swinburne,
Peacock, Mackinnon and Boyd have
arrived, though more than one of
them show signs that they reckon it
time they got away for a change of
air.
“ Iyles Innison ” : The late Dr.
William C. Speece, the entertaining
“ Medicuss ” of The Bulletin, was
a merry cuss in his own peculiar
way. When leaving a town he
would never accept a send-off. He
always preferred to invite those whom
he deemed his true friends to say
good-bye over a social glass provided
by himself. He reckoned this the
best method of excluding the hypo-
crite element from valedictory gather-
ings. One day the Wilcannia (N.S.W.)
coach brought from Milparinka(where
Speece was the hospital medical
officer) a poor human derelict, with
a damaged back. “Medicuss” had
given him a letter of introduction,
and here are some extracts from it: —

luck and a darned poor doctor. Fate has not only stacked
the cards on him, but has snavelled [copyright] one of

and drink. lam a stranger in Wilcannia, but I cheer-
mily recommend the bearer to rely on Dr. Bell and
Brother Bill (meaning Mr. W. Morrison). What in
Gehenna is the use of knowing men’s names unless you

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He could not help remembering- that we did not stand
m° ne A we .re related by every tie to Great Britain....
Was Great Britain’s solemn pledge to see to the naval
defence of Australia enough ?.. . The sea power of Great
Britain would protect Australia for ten years to come, but
the moment it ceased to be efficient, serious efforts would
have to be made for the military training of the manhood
of the nation.... There was no need to make service com-
pulsory until an emergency arose.—Gkorge Reid, on
Australian National Defence.
There lived a cautious man in days of yore,
Who most securely locked his stable door
After the robbers had purloined his steed.
His name was Reid.
A Voice rang through the silence of the land,
Calling a loud, imperative command
Amongst a populace that leaned on posts :
“ Awake ! Arise ! Arm ’gainst the yellow hosts 1 ”
But there was one who slowly gazed around,
Removed his pipe, and spat upon the ground,
Then said, “Aw, ’eaps o’ time ter git up speed.”
His name was Reid.
Again, a later day, the Voice rang out;
And now the populace took up the shout:
“ The yellow horde is thundering at our gate ! ”
But one man yawned and said, “ Aw, can’t yer wait?
Old Mother Hingland ain’t too sick ter fight.
Chuck ’er a bob er two, she’ll see us right.
Yer mighty anxious ter git out an’ bleed !”
His name was Reid.
The fight was over ; the invader crushed ;
When 10, across the distant landscape rushed
A wild, excited man in war array,
Calling his countrymen to join the fray.
He wore a single, unlaced boot, this man ;
He buttoned up his waistcoat as he ran,
Crying “To arms ! To arms ! I come to lead !"
His name was Reid.
The long years sped ; and 10, a trumpet’s roar
Wakened the earth’s long dead to life once more.
Men hastened to the tryst from far and near ;
Except one man, who, turning in his bier,
Complained, “ All right, but please don’t rush, don’t rush !
I’ll get there later, and avoid the crush.”
But the officials gave him little heed.
His name was Reid.
Time ceased his labor, and the sun grew cold ;
Beneath the stars the Earth, deserted, rolled ;
The good and evil man found each his place.
But one lone soul, meandering through space,
At length approached the outer Golden Gate,
And found a placard there : ‘ ‘ House full. Too late. ”
It was a lonely, lonely sprite indeed.
Its name was Reid.
There is a spirit doomed for evermore
To shut, and shut, and shut a stable door,
Always too late to save a fiendish steed.
This sprite is Reid.

A SONG OF CREDIT
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the State Parliamentary party visiting- Mount
Buffalo arrived at the summit of the mount on Friday
evening, the scene resembled that depicted on English
Christmas cards. There was snow everywhere. It bowed
down the fronds of bracken, snuggled in every hollow,
traced the upper curve of every fallen tree, and rolled
away in an even surface across every slope. The general
comment was that it was magnificent. The Premier (T.
Bent) filled his lungs with the clear mountain air, and
addressing Mr. A. A. Billson, M.L.A., said, “It’s a bit
better than the world I made down Melbourne way.”—
Daily paper.
I made me a world in Melbourne—l made it with gas and
bills,
Then I went and looked with Billson at His deeds from
His snow-clad hills.
And I said straight out to Billson, as I gazed on the thing
divine,
“I praise good work when I see it; this one is better
than mine ! ”
I talked of a Land of Promise—with some small help
from the Jew ;
I led not my people to it, I met not my IOU;
I babbled of farms and acres, and found not a single sod ;
But I take all credit for it, and give some credit to God.

RHEUMATISM IN EVERY JOINT.
A Case in Sydney that Baffled Medicai.
Skill.
Lost the Use of His Arms at times. Two
Years of the Greatest Agony. Then
Cured For Good by Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills.
People tortured with rheumatism have only to
read what Mr. James W. Peacock says to be con-
vinced that there lies a cure for them in Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills. Mr. Peacock was actually
paralysed with pain, and suffered the greatest
agony for two years. The best medical attention
was only able to ease him for a time. Now Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills don't merely ease pain : they
drive it clean out of the system. Rheumatic suf-
ferers can prove this by giving them a thorough
trial.
“I had rheumatism off and on for about two
years,” said Mr. Peacock. “ I was attacked from
the neck to both hips, across the shoulders and
down the arms. Every now and then I’d have to
knock off work and lay up at home. At times I
could hardly move in bed ; at other times I could
not turn my head nor move my arms. It was a
great trouble for me to lace my boots ; bending at
all gave me great pain. I was rubbed with tur-
pentine and various liniments, but I only got ease
for a time. Every rubbing made the parts so ten-
der that I could not bear anyone to come near me
after each one. The least movement and I suffer-
ed fearfully. I could only walk very slowly, and
very often I was so stiff that it was all I could do
to drag myself along. I never knew when an
attack was going to take me. Perhaps I’d go to
bed all right and wake up in the morning practi-
cally unable to move. I’d be like this for days
before I’d get a little ease. I might get a sudden
bout when working and have to come home and
take to my bed. My mates can tell you how I
couldn’t get my coat on with the pain; I had to
get one of them to just throw it across my
shoulders. Often the pain was so fierce that it
took me all my time to keep from singing out with
it. I went off my food completely and lost weight
fast. I went to a doctor andjtook his medicines,
but I can’t say that I got much better. A friend
of mine in N. Zealand told mt to give Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills a trial. I did, and it was
marvellous the way they cured me, and they cured
me for good, too, for I have never had a return of
the rheumatism since. My health in general is
excellent.” . T .

POLITICAL
POINTS
A BRILLIANT DEFENCE SCHEME, AND
THE PROBABLE RESULT.
Mr. Reid : “If we stood alone I would look upon
the possibilities of invasion with great concern. But the
name of Great Britain stands for much in attack, in de-
fence, in peace, and in diplomacy. As to the possibilities
of a raid, the authorities agree that it could not extend
to much more than four unarmored cruisers, with 1000
men. And are our fears aroused by the possibilities of
1000 men landing on our shores?
“J defy you, dogs!” cried the noble youth,
girded in British pluck. “ Lo, guarded
thus, I stand immune ’’ But just here
the other bloke struck.
There is a great necessity for some
arrangement which will confine the debate on a
vote of censure to one day, so as to get on with
public business. As matters stand it may drag
along for an almost indefinite period. Reid’s vote
of censure in the Representatives endangers the
Capital Site Bill, the Northern Territory Bill, the
Defence Bill and the Navigation Bill—ir. fact, all
the great mass of work which was laid out for this
session may be talked to death and the whole
session end in smoke.
The Owe’Sullivan didn’t for so many years
represent Queanbeyan (N.S.W.)in vain. Witness
this message:—
At a meeting of the subscribers of the Queanbeyan
School of Arts on Thursday it was resolved to mortgage
the building and land for £3OO, to enable the committee
to instal a billiard table.
To make the thing complete, all that is now neces-
sary is for the committee to get the right to borrow
another £5O, so that this present independent,
self-respecting generation won’t have to foot the
bill for its own chalk. What’s the use of having
sons and grandsons if you can’t get them to pay
for your billiards !
At a recent function to commemorate 20
years’ successful trading, Wunderlich, the head of
the big Sydney metal ceiling people, held forth
thus:—
We established these works under Freetrade
Opportunities were small, and there was no scope for out-
siders ; but, once established, we had to fear and consider
outside influence. The Kingston Protection helped us a
little, but it led to no great increase. The Lyne tariff
gave a protection of 25 per cent., and since its commence-
ment PRICES HAVE STEADILY GONE DOWN. We COllld IlOt
have done this without Protection ; we would have been
swamped by outside markets. Now importations have
practically ceased, and 1000 people are supported by the
industry.
A very frequent gibe made by the Federal
Tory Opposition is that Treasurer Lyne had
starved the Post Office. Again and again has
this been hurled at him just to annoy hirn, and
when he gets heated and starts to explain who it
was that cut down the estimates, the whole crowd
whines that “ it isn’t fair.” Just such an incident
happened the other night, when the Treasurer
was delivering his Budget. He was defending his
own administration of the Treasury, when that
choleric old gentleman, Big John Forrest, yelled :
“Put it on to someone else, if you can!” Lyne
put it on to Forrest right there, and explained
that some of the reductions had been made by
Forrest himself, who had cut down certain de-
partments by no less than £97,100. The howl
which followed would have deafened a chorus in
Sheol, Slow Cook, Esq., objecting that it was
“ playing it very low down.” It might have been.
But ,if Large John hadn’t played it lower, it
wouldn’t have been played at all.
Ryrie, M.L.A., of N.S.W., supporter
of the Canberra site, made a disastrous statement
to Sydney Star (14/10/’08)
“I think,” he said, “that 400 square miles should be
given for the Federal capital, with access to Jervis Bay,
because the country between Canberra and the coast is
comparatively poor; HENCE it would not materially
matter how much of the country we give to the
Commonwealth.”
In fact, according to Rvrie, the only thing to be
given away for Australia’s capital is the sort of
country that is of no use to man or beast. Dalgety
with its rich plains and its clear, swift river—the
district on which the present State. Government is
spending thousands of pounds in roads, rest
houses and sanatoriums —was a territory to be
niggardly about. But Canberra —well, Ryrie
thinks that Canberra is only fit to be thrown at a
dog. And Colonel Granville de Laune Ryrie
ought to know ; he represents that district and
lives in it.
Political portents these days in Queens-
land are to be read, not, as of old, in the columns
of the Brisbane dailies, but in the pro-
vincial press. Brisbane’s four squeakers
are all in their hearts anti-Kidstonite,
and have wobbled themselves out of
public confidence and political in-
fluence. Result: Political leaders
ignore them. At last election the
Kidston-Labor parties captured twelve
seats, to Philp’s four seats, right within
the sphere of Brisbane’s alleged in-
fluence ; and three of the successful
Philpites were ex-Ministers, while
eight of the other crowd were untried
and almost unknown men. When
people want to know the next move on
the Queensland political board they
turn nowadays to the Warwick Argus
(edited by Morgan), Toowoomba
Chronicle (the powerful Groom organ),
or the Rockhampton Bulletin (the
paper that keeps Kidston’s seat safe).
The Brisbane dailies are deliberately
kept out of “the know.’’ Even the
Mail, although some of the Ministers
occasionally dribble it an item of in-
spiration, has failed to get itself taken
seriously as a democratic fugleman;
but Kidston would be a very sick
potentate without liis country bar-
rackers.
Left to himself, the big landlord
doesn’t grow even a respectable num-
ber of sheep. In the past few years
the S. Aus. Government has been
doing a good deal of land-repurchase
in the south-east; besides one or two
estates bought very recently, it has
taken over 103,000 acres at a cost of about
£295,000, and made them available for closer
settlement. And now even the Register has
to admit that, not only has the wheat yield
been doubled and the oat and barley harvest
quadrupled in 10 years, but the number of sheep
has increased from 1,353,000 to 1,701,000.
Three times Treasurer Peake (S.A.) has
got a Bill passed by the Assembly to empower
juries to return verdicts of murder in the first,
second or third degree, with punishments varying
from death to short terms of imprisonment; but
as the Leg. Council has thrown it out each time,
he has now brought in another to give a jury the
right to add to a verdict of murder the words
“ but the prisoner shall not be sentenced to death.”
That direction is to be absolutely binding on the
Judge. Peake also proposes that the jury shall
have the option of bringing in a verdict of man-
slaughter.
A fairly comprehensive measure is the
new N.S.W. Police Offences Amendment Bill.
It prohibits opium-eating, opium-smoking, the
keeping of opium-dens, shilling sweeps, fan-tan,
pak-a-pu, two-up, the sale of sweep tickets, the
matchbox trick, the rich uncle from Fiji, time-
payment swindles, the letting off of crackers in
the street, the putting of additional fuel on bon-
fires in the street, the habit of living on the earn-
ings of women of ill-fame, the habit, in certain
circumstances, of leaning up against posts outside
bars and billiard rooms, and the habit of being
around generally under certain conditions. In
fact, it is a well-meaning measure, and is calcu-
lated, if it is enforced, to wear the aggregate
bobbydom of the State to such a thin shadow that
it will look like a fast day turned sideways.
Many strings, some of them fairly long
ones, are being pulled to beguile the Senate into
leaving Dalgety wholly out of the Federal capital
ballot and substituting Tooma. Toorna hasn’t the
spectre of a chance, and its insertion in place of
the splendid Snowy River site would make the
Yassberra selection practically certain. Mean-
while Jervis Bay, the port of Yassberra, where the
promise of a Federal sea-outlet bought sundry
votes for the ’Berra site, continues to be only 87
miles from Sydney, and well inside the forbidden
Federal capital radius.
CALLING OUT THE LAST RESERVES.
Under the new Australian Defence Bill every
man aged under 60 is liable for military service
though he doesn't need to go into training.
Even slow old Windsor (N.S.W.) begins
to have its suspicions that this Protectionist tariff
isn’t all curse. The recently started condensed
milk factory at Pitt Town is unable to cope with
the increasing Australian demand, and the milk
suppliers in the neighborhood are discussing the
enlargement of the factory, and the erection of
another one at Windsor.
The object of one of N.S.W. Premier
Wade’s latest Bills is to cut down the salaries of
Sydney Harbor Trust Commissioners and to
extend the life of steamers’ sea-going certificates,
issued after survey, from six months to 12. The
subjects have absolutely nothing to do with one
another ; it would be about as reasonable to bring
in a Bill altering the weekly half-holiday, dealing
with prickly pear, and providing a schedule of
fees chargeable at inquests. Wade’S majority will
doubtless stand by him in cutting down the Com-
missioners’ pay, but even it, one would think, will
hardly stand the certificate idea. The House and
the country haven’t forgotten the Bega, which ill-
fated ship tipped over, despite even a six-monthly
survey.
It is interesting, in view of the fact that
G. Reid is making a dismal song about Deakin’s
infamy in proposing that young men should, for
Defence purposes, be “registered like dogs,” to
recall a few citizens who are liable already to be
registered, and who have been supporting the
registration stigma for years past without taking
to the dog-kennel as a steady residence. For
example: Chemists, dairymen, milk vendors,
newspaper sellers, doctors, cabmen, barristers,
solicitors, pubkeepers, plumbers, gasfitters, van-
men, slaughterhouse owners, boatmen, every child
born in Australia, every person who gets married
in Australia, every person who dies in Australia,
dentists, pawnbrokers, all adults who desire votes,
publishers of newspapers, business firms, children
put out to be nursed for payment, tobacconists and
money-lenders. There are others, including clergy-
men who are authorised ’to celebrate marriages
and Justices of the Peace, but these are a few to
go on with. And the wonderful George Reid has
discovered at this late hour that registration
makes one feel like a dog. In that case why
doesn’t he bark ?
Treasurer Lyne has smiles upon his face.
The Sydney Chamber of Commerce, some time
ago, made a fine row over the alleged mismanage-
ment of the Sydney Customs business and the
cruel treatment of Sydney merchants generally.
Lyne undertook to straighten things where they
were crooked, and asked for specific instances of
the crookedness. In fact, he simply besought the
Chamber to find a grievance—a little one would
do if it couldn’t find any other. So the Chamber
circularised its members. It even went outside
and called upon merchants and trading persons
unconnected with the sacred Chamber for a list of
their injustices and degradations. The Council
received 13 answers, most of them praising the
Customs Department, and now it can’t look
William in the face.
Sydney Telegraph’s gift for discovering a
grievance on behalf of poor old Ma State amounts
to genius. On Saturday, it interviewed Hughes,
M.H.R., concerning Reid’s censure, motion.
Hughes said :
It can result in nothing but useless and unnecessary
talk. ... In view of the position of the Federal capital
question, it is to the last degree unfortunate. It is cal-
culated to at least prejudice very materially the chance
of a settlement of that question by the selection of Yass-
Canberra in the Senate.
And in its leader (19/10/’08), the Telegraph
handled Hughes and his remarks this way :
When Mr. Hughes threatens that because Mr. Reid
has taken this course members of the Senate will be so
incensed as to spite New South Wales by vetoing the
selection of Yass-Oanberra as the capital site, he plainly
indicates the chagrin that the party feels. . . . Hence
Mr. Hughes’ threat must be made on behalf of the Labor
members there, in which case he has allowed his annoy-
ance to cause him to take a course that can certainly be
described as “ very ill-advised.”
Hughes voted steadily and very foolishly for the
Telegraph’s favorite Yassberra site, and he and
Watson toiled hard on behalf of the ill-selected
place. And this is his reward !
The Federal budget moved N.S.W. State
Premier Wade to complain bitterly because the
Commonwealth doesn’t borrow money. Wade
simply yearns for debt. This was his plaint:
The whole scheme of Commonwealth expenditure
brings before us forcibly the question whether the Com-
monwealth is justified in saddling the States with expen-
diture from revenue in respect of works that should be
PAID FOR FROM LOANS.
Anyone might think, on reading this grumble,
that the Commonwealth was cutting N.S.W.
short in the matter of revenue. But Treasurer
Lyne promises to pay N.S.W. this year over
£3,300,000 of Customs and Excisei revenue, which is
two millions more than it received when it was
running things on its own in the last year before
Federation. And with all this magnificent result
the wretched, grumpy man, Wade, isn’t satisfied,
and says the Commonwealth ought to borrow
money so as to return him more revenue.
Some strange questions are asked in the
N.S.W. Assembly. As a case in point, Varney
Parkes, M.L.A., has five questions about Cook’s
River on the notice paper, and the first two are
as follows :
(1) Is it a fact that Cook’s River is the only important
natural feature within the metropolitan area named in
the earlier days after the discoverer, Captain Cook?
(2) Is it a fact that the valley and serpentine course of
this inlet are by nature of a most picturesque and
attractive character?
“Vigilans”: At Bell, a few miles out
from Dalby (Q.), you see the folly of putting the
wrong men on to the land. A group settlement
was formed, and 20 Britishers and others arrived
to occupy the place. One of the score a
retired Indian Judge, three were clerks, the
rest were mostly city folks. Only one of them
remains, and he was partly Australian. The
country on to which this lot were flung
is dense scrub land that only an experi-
enced bushman would have the pluck or
the knowledge to tackle. The town-bred
settlers were aghast at it, called it
Jungle, and fled—most of them—to England and
other parts to ask what Queensland meant by
describing this land as ready for the plough.
The Women’s Christian Temperance Union
held a conference in Melbourne a few days ago.
About 150 delegates were present, and, amongst
others, they carried the following resolution :
That, as followers of the Prince of Peace, we deprecate
the war-spirit, believing that arbitration would be effect-
ive in most cases, and would settle the differences between
nations; that we express our disapproval of the purely
military services proposed by the Government, on the
ground of it being inexpedient, and in opposition to
British liberty of conscience.
No doubt arbitration would be effective in most
cases _jf the other fellow would arbitrate. The
trouble is that the other fellow generally won’t
arbitrate when he sees that, owing to this fellow’s
weakness, he can get more some other way.
Perhaps that was why the Prince of Peace said :
“He that hath no sword, let him sell his gar-
ment and buy one.”
“ Jean Sibi ” writes :
At present Melbourne has a dark suspicion that Tait’s
railway hirelings shovel a lot of official oblivion on to
incidents reflecting on departmental administration.
It would almost take its oath that the scarce accident
which gets into the papers does so through the negligence
of an understrapper who spoke out of his turn, and that
the accidents that don’t reach the papers are censored by
a conspiracy of silence and buried in quicklime. Whether
Tait and his aides can he accused of such devious methods
to soothe the public into a feeling of confidence and
security it is, of course, impossible to say ; but there is
some foundation for the allegation that they preserve a
scandalous secrecy towards their employers, the public.
Shortly after the Sunshine holocaust, it was asserted that
an accident with equally tragic possibilities had just been
averted some time before, though it hadn t crept into the
press; while, only a day or two ago, a country corre-
spondent stated that, at the sune fatal junction, an
engine attached to the Adelaide express had run over the
points, smashed a cow-catcher, and delayed the train an
hour. Neither of those alleged incidents received any
offiei il corroboration, so presumably they never hap-
pened. Yet, as the weight of reliability is in this case on
the side of unofficial statements, they probably did hap-
pen. However, the trouble is that Tait’s crowd won’t say
whether they did or not. Anybody would think they
were running a secret society.
AUSTRALIA’S BULWARKS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Senator Millen professed to have little faith in the
existing control of the forces. . . . He deprecated “panic-
raising,” which was only an invitation to foreign Powers
to consider the very enterprise which Australia wished to
avoid.
“Do yotl think we should do nothing?” said the
Minister for Defence.— Parliamentary report.
The German and the Jap may chafe
Against our nationhood,
But we must make Australia safe —
It’s really time we should !
We can’t afford (our Mentors teach)
To spend a silver shillin’
On ships—why should we, with a speech
From Millen?
It’s time that something should be done
To show each hostile neighbor,
That, though we can’t afford a gun,
A bayonet, or sabre,
We might find something that will help
To pound them into jelly—
How ivould they scoot before a yelp
From Kelly ?
Australia’s not a fluffy thing
Of fat and feeble habit,
A pat of butter on a string,
Or silly, woolly rabbit;
No ! Unsuspected as an owl
Hid in some gloomy nook.
Waits her weird force —a doleful howl
From Oook 1
Do not Awake ! Arise ! or Arm !
Or train for vulgar fight !
Our land is girdled with a charm
From Cooktown to the Bight;
Safe is each city, safe each port
From foreign foeman’s greed—
How shall he stand against a snort
' From Reid ?
How can he last a single week
(The mere thought makes us laugh)
Before the dread, tremendous squeak
Of our strong Telegraph ?
Or how stand up and face the sniff
The Herald can exude?
Ha 1 Ha ! ’Tvvould knock the foeman stiff
As J ude!

I’m the
Robur Tea Girl!
Audi want to tell you about
the four grades of our tea.
“SPECIAL” GRADE is
for tea-tasters and people who
don’t mind the price so long
as they get the best. The
flavor of “ Special” is simply
delicious—experts describe it
as “finest” and say
“it is cheap at any price.”
People who have no knowledge
of tea beyond what the ordinary
person knows may not see
much difference between it
and the No. 1 Grade which
comes next. Still, that doesn’t
alter the fact—Robur “Special ”
is as good a tea as money will
buy.
No. 1 GRADE is beautiful
tea ; and unless one happened
to be a tea-taster or something
of the kind, it is just easy to
believe that there couldn’t
possibly be any better tea than
our No. 1 Grade—it has
such a full rich flavor, such
quality and is so wonderfully
economical.
No. 2 GRADE is nice
tea —it has a full flavor^—a
splendid rich golden color when
you put milk in it—just the tea
to suit for everyday use—
compared with Ceylon or
ordinary blended tea it stands
right away—it is nicer and goes
further.
No. 3 GRADE is better
tea than many housekeepers
buy for everyday use—it has
a full smooth flavor, and is very
strong—it is best described as
“sound nice-flavored, useful tea”
—you’d be surprised if you
knew some of the people who
drink this grade—how much
of it finds its way into the
homes of the rich, and how
many thousands there are who
never drink anything else.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, October 20, 1908.
My Dear Arini,—
_ I glode curiously into the Women’s Anti-
Socialist Conference last week. lam rather sorry
1 did. My walks abroad were marred thereafter
by the spectacle of small knots of self-con-
scious eonferencers wandering about the city
with a minatory gleam in their eyes. Palpably
the ladies were on the look-out for the monster
Sosh. They were vaguely suggestive somehow,
with their air of almost aggressive attention to the
public welfare, of the callow policeman treading
the beat for the first time. What the good souls
would have done had they encountered Sosh I
know not—-probably hurled their spectacles at it,
or smitten it upon its horned skull with gamps.
They did not find the horror, so there was no dis-
turbance. (I understand that one explanation of
the failure of their quest is that the Anti-Sosh
woman dismisses all existing forms of Sosh—trams,
railways, telephones, hospitals, etc.—as things
that are not Sosh at all. The idea is, seemingly,
that the moment a thing is nationalised it is not
an example of Sosh any more: in fact, it then
becomes a powerful argument in favor of Anti-
Sosh. This makes for elusiveness on the part of
Sosh. And so the pursuit of it is never-ending.
It is the Ravager’s baffling way to approach no
nearer than a mile or so below the dim horizon.)
It is a, dreary thing to see bands of ladies tracking
an animal unceasingly and not finding it. Our
visitors of last week quite depressed me as I
watched them on the trail.
To return to the Conference : a consideration
of it convinced me that conferring on political
matters is not a game which the prosperous of my
sex play to. advantage. The well-to-do female
does not give political and economic questions
deep thought out of conference hours. The cult of
Anti-Sosh represents, to a woman, allurement’s
forlorn hope. There is a certain brand of
male who will listen with a patronising smile
while a damsel prattles Bruce Smithisras into
his pink ear. But he is scarce—your normal
moneyed male hates, like poison the female who
worries him with politics, the differential calcu-
lus, and »other knotty topics— and even when
found he mostly isn’t worth bothering about.
Moreover the prattler, owing to her lack of vital
interest in the subject under prattlement, remains
for ever an amateur; she is liable constantly to
perpetrate crass “bloomers” that she would
never be guilty of if she stuck to discussing the
prices at Jones , the dearth of really satisfactory
skin-foods, the unreliability of anti-fat mixtures,
and so forth. When I ventured in on the Conference
last week, an Anti-Socialist lady was passionately
advocating the nationalisation of the liquor in-
dustry. Said she, in the ringing tones that accom-
pany absolute conviction :
The Governments of the different States of our Com-
monwealth should have sole control of the manufacture
and sale of all intoxicating liquors.
About three-quarters of the Conference was with
her. It had not grasped the full purport of her
utterance. Then a nasty rumor got round.
“Isn’t Government control the same as Social-
ism T’ whispered a plump lady on my left, who
had previously read a paper entitled, “Sosh from
the Inside —a Paralyser,” or words to that effect.
As soon as it was properly appreciated that the
speaker was enthusing about a form of Sosh that
was still over the horizon, so to speak, she was
chided very sharply. She had broken the rules".
Some were for hissing her. The lady on my left
(her paper, “Sosh from the Inside,” etc., had,
shfe confided to me, been written for her by her
son in Melbourne) would have, she opined, some
very destructive criticism to level at the whole
foolish were she only able to get into com-
munication with her offspring in time.
The most anxious moment the Conference had
was during the reading of a challenge by one
Mrs. Bertha McNamara, of the S.D.F., to debate
the subject of Anti-Socialism with any woman
present. A shudder swept over the Assembly.
“Disgusting !” murmured the owner of a neatly-
typed paper. Who wants to debate and argue
in public? Why can’t she get someone to do a
paper for her, like a lady, and come and read it
without any unpleasantness ? Downright common
I call it! But, then, what can you expect from a
Socialist l And the resolution not to allow any-
one to be so mad as to debate with the dangerous
Mrs. McNamara was carried unanimously. "
The customary Rumor is afloat regarding the
local spinster with more money than she can
spend by herself. It is the same old Rumor that
has been pursuing her for years. He is, of course,
an Elevated Personage. He always is. This
time he is a lone widower ; also he is older than
any of the others. But then he has occurred
later. It only remains to note that this particular
Rumor is having heavy weights of denial attached
to its neck daily with the object of drowning it •
or at any rate rendering it too unseaworthy to
live in the social deeps.
The handsome Macnamara twins have grasped
the matrimonial nettle firmly and will “go
off ” shortly side by side. ' One will marry
Mr. Noel Mair; the other has pre-empted one
Kerouse. The dashing twins have earned the
admiring felicitations of their world.
Question : Did Miss Rawson go away on that
10 days’ motor trip to elude the calamity of hav-
ing to sit out nearly three hours of Ibsen as
interpreted by the Stage Society ? If so, she was
a cute Miss Rawson. The play, “A Doll’s
House,” was the Society’s first effort, and was
given in aid of the Milk Dispensaries, ’a charity
inaugurated by Miss Rawson at a Cranbrook
drawing-room meeting some months ago. A
downpour of rain somewhat diluted the pure-
milk audience, but there was a good house
Furthermore, the audience was patient and
the bouquet of appreciation was handed over the
footlights by the dozen. The influence of “A
un - «°V se " on t^e dramaturgists of “ The
J-tnet and “The Truth ” was commented on by
everyone who saw Margaret Anglin play the mis-
demeanant pieces. That is,it was commented upon
by everyone who had read “A Doll’s House.”
Most of us had—ages ago. And as for the influ-
ence of Margaret Anglin on Mrs. Elsa Buhrow,
the IN ora Helmer of Saturday’s production—well,
a great writer has said that “imitation is suicide.”
xet Mrs. Buhrow is still alive. Margaret Anglin’s
exicted trick of giving a disclaimer “ N-n-n-n-n-n-
-no, running rapidly down the scale, was abjectly
imitated. So were her curious compelling little
ways in love-making. Yet Mrs. Buhrow is said
to have had good status as a professional actress
in her own country. In the first two acts Mrs.
Buhrow looked the part of the toy-wife and doll-
mother pretty well, but in the last act when—evi-
dently through neglect of her friends behind the
scenes—she was compelled to put her black
(runnmg-away) frock on over her pink fancy dress
and return to the stage with it only partially
hooked up at the back, she looked like Helmer’s
mother, such width did it give her. Where was
the stage-manager ? Where was the prompter,
or the scene-shifter, or the professional back-
hooker ?
When she came on with that fish-shaped piece
of pink showing through the black, the audience
clenched its hands nervously and left the chocolate
cream bulging in its cheek. When the ladv made
an exit, and returned with the gape still" there
the audience felt like explaining to the ama-
teurs (not Nora) what it thought of them.
Helmer s last scene with Nora was spoilt by that
back-view. He hadn’t the courage to arise and
fasten the frock, while telling Nora that she was
so distraught that she hadn’t finished dressing
herself. He just looked, went paralytic, and the
lady forgot or jumbled her lines. After the play
1 trust Mrs. Buhrow spoke severely to someone.
Miss F. St. George, who took the part of Mrs.
Linden, was refreshingly frank and natural in a
role that doesn’t admit of a single parlor trick.
Mr. G. F. Gilhooley. a brother of Mayoress
Hughes, was the Nils Krogstad of the piece—the
bad man who wants to rise on his dead self to
higher things. When he left Nora’s drawing-room
after an afternoon call he forgot his hat. And
when Helmer was introduced to his wife’s greatest
friend, Mrs. Linden, he didn’t bow or shake
hands.
Taking it by and large it was a most entertain-
ing performance, and the players spoke up well.
Every word could be heard, which is more than
can be said for the elocution of most amateurs.
An unusually pretty Sydney girl, Miss Shirley
Sly, who is still in her teens, was married quietly
early this month to Major Luther, an English
visitor. Dr. J. D. Sly has the privilege of being
the damsel’s father, and it is a pleasure that anv
legal or other gentleman would be glad to possess.
Mrs. (Dr.) Weston, who used to be of Point
Piper, writes an informative postcard from the
liner on which she was travelling somewhere in
the neighborhood of Pharaoh’s drowning accident.
Amongst her fellow passengers was an Arabian
gentleman with his three wives—beautifully-
dressed ladies, decked with costly jewellery, and
consuming unlimited cigarettes.' They dwelt in
unruffled amity together, but one—alwavs =the
same one—stayed with the Arabian husband
whilst the other two went off and paced the deck
or read together.
Miss Ola Humphrey, who will reappear in Mel-
bourne on the 31st (what time the Derby winner
is cooling down in his stall and munching his
gilded oats), has been a suffering artiste for the last
five or six weeks. In Adelaide, whilst play-
ing her Lady Blakeney part in “The Scarlet
Pimpernel,” she was suddenly smitten with a
frightful pain. It was quite new to her—she
had never been introduced to that pain ; and
when, later, a doctor called it sciatica she didn’t
like it any the better. The poor girl herself
thought, until the doctor came, that it was broken
leg. She went through the performance, and
many others, in anguish, and not until the last
day or two of the season in Perth did she get rid
of the Dweller on the Threshold.
The portrait of Mrs. J. Chester, by Norman
Lindsay, is one of the most eye-arresting studies
in this year’s Society of Artists’ exhibition.
Warm brown as to vesture and bashed-looking as
to hat, red-brown as to eyes and hair, with the
pink of corals at throat and ears, the sitter rests
her delicately-pointed, chin on the palm of her
hand, and turns strange bright eyes—such eyes as
Cleopatra may have turned on some debatable
human proposition—on to the gazer. The time the
gazer spends returning that challenging glance is
a compliment to painter and painted.
Most of our well-known artists have in this
Show worked a pitch above their former efforts.
Sid Long, with his “Moonrise,” his “Still
Waters,” his “Afternoon Light” and his grey
landscapes, seems to have got yet nearer to under-
standing “the clear-eyed Spring with the wood
birds mating, the rose-red Summer with eyes
aglow.” And when the Sid Long moon slowly
rounds into sight over an inland patch of water,
and puts silver hems on clouds and rocks and
tree trunks, you feel that he is on equally good
terms of understanding with the time when the
sunset gates are barred.
Lionel Lindsay has a huge showing. He is the
painter of the vertical rain of sunlight as shown in
his “Bed Roofs and Blue Water,” or his sun
pours in a slanting flood across a broad green
sward, or a garden, or the United States fleet at
Cremorne. This Lindsay paints heat—his heat
becomes like unto a living thing. And there’s a
new man, one Griiner, who in “Woodland
Sparkle” and “A Sunlit Wood” has just ex-
pressed the mystery of golden-tissued atmosphere
enfolding tree-bole and foliage.
Miss Thea Proctor has added cubits to her
stature —in an artistic sense, of course. As a
colorist, she proves herself in “ The Terrace ” and
“ The Fan. ” First picture tells a story surely.
A lady leans upon the terrace balustrade, her
conscious face turned from the handsome fair
man in West End evening clothes who bends by
her side. He is a Lambert-made man, rather gay-
doggy an< 3 Gallic-looking. The pale maize of the
girl’s gown and the coloring of furnishings—wine
and fruit and glasses—of the round table is a
chromatic feast.
Julian Ashton and sonny Howard are numer-
ously represented. I’ve walked in “the Wet
Road ’ of Pa Ashton and felt the mud and water
go “squelch squelch’’ under my goloshes. He,
Ashton senior, really opened the Exhibition in a
cynically humorous speech, although he invited
the Mayor to do the formal unpenning.
Some of the girl exhibitors show a most delight-
ful sense of humor. In fact they supply what
there is of that commodity in tile Exhibition.
Miss M. G. Nicholls’ child series ending with
“ Men Simply Hate to be Kept Waiting”—a
lady killer of seven or eight summers waiting
restively while a belle of five or so draws on her
gloves, quite conscious that she is exasperating the
male infant by her delay—is an, adorable thing.
And then there is Miss Morgan’s conception
of “Washing Day.” A little girl is scouring
a collie dog in a tub, whilst a lineful
of smaller “washing” already hangs out
to dry—cats and dogs pegged by their ears or
tails. Miss Ruby Winckler’s work is in her best
startling and original vein. Her “Sketch for a
Frieze” is a joyous combination of the dancing
satyr, and the merry-widow kind of damsel, and
the angry peacock that would peck the hoof of a
satyr. Miss Nellie Rodd is coming along con-
scientiously, and has some ambitious work in the
black-and-white section.
That amazing strenuous little worker, Miss
May Summerbelle, has paused in the composition
of waltzes and songs to put a new “Ave Maria ”
before the Great White Throne. I don’t know
how it was received Up'There, but when sung at
a city church with flute obligato it wrested com-
pliments from Cardinal Moran.
The Mr. Reginald Vaughan who has married
Mrs. Prendergast, late of Sydney, was first mar-
ried to a sister of the beknighted Patrick Jen-
nings’ wife. He had conie here on a visit to his
brother, Archbishop Vaughan, when he met the
lady.
The Rawson Memorial Fund is fattening. It

Excellency and Excellencette on the completion
of their motor tour will go South for the Great
Horse and Frock Display.
From S. Shanley, Brurrong State School, Hills-
borough, I have to acknowledge receipt of 55.,
which sum makes the sender a year’s member of
that gentle charity, the Child Study Association.
It is surely a rush of shyness to the pocket that
deters some five thousand or soother persons from
following S. Shanley’s kindly lead.
Hundreds of opals and several black swans (live
,mealt) were amongst the Australian products that
Kubelik took away with hinp The rate at which
his luggage augmented as he fiddled through the
continent put a rolling snowball out of competition.
Till a few days back I cherished a vague idea
that the only place to find an R.M. was Ireland.
Mr. William Kenny, who has just married Miss
Pearl Weigall, of “Glenora,” Edgeeliff-road, has
changed my point of view. He owns a father who
is an R.M. in the Federated Malay States. The
bride is one of the large and growing clan of
Weigalls, who sought these climes in the wake of
the headmaster of the S. G. School. She will not
be seen in this suffering portion of the Common-
wealth for some time to come ; her new husband
is spiriting her to a land where grievances be-
tween State and State are settled at the point of
the kris.
Miss Betty Ohls, the little sauerkrauter who
replaces Miss Carrie Moore on Saturday week in
“ The Merry Widow,” reminds of Miss Margaret
Thomas and Miss Florrie Gleeson. She is smaller
than the present Widow. Her voice, though also
small, is good. Miss Ohls came to this country
with the “Merrymakers” troupe, and explains
that she went to seeJ.C.W. on the chance of a
job, and intimated to him that she would just
“ do ” for the Relict contract.
“ Mario” writes from Brisbane
Government House shed the light of that which inter-
poses between its collar and its hat on the opening of the
Goondiwindi railway (destined to keep our local-grown
fleece from drifting into your base and conspiring State).
That light was the only one present, as the window of
Heaven fell out and it just poured sky-juice. However,
their Exes, are used to this sort of thing now. Rain
seems to follow them everywhere, and it has been sug-
gested that a Federal capital at Charlotte Waters, with
our Ex. as Governor-General and Chief Rainmaker, would
take well. Charlotte Waters is said to be the centre of
Australia’s drought, and a boss rainmaker there, shedding
moisture in all directions, seems a great idea.
Toy’s proved quite the nicest music that Brisbaneites
have been treated to for a long, long time. It befell in
the old Centennial Hall, on Thursday last. Toy was
backed up by Dr. W. S. Byrne, Mus. Bac., and Miss Elaine
Feez on the piano ; W. Allan, A. H. Sleath, and Max
Muller on strings; and Kellie Kenny as soprano.
Our champion fiddler gave an exposition that
was worth an expensive front seat to enjoy.
His own items included a mazourka, the composition
of Eunice Lucas, a Brisbane girl at present studying in
Fogville ; and a fetching “ Witches’Dance.” The audience
was of generous proportions. (I do not allude to its
waist circumference.) It was what the papers call a large
and fashionable gathering.
Our latest engagement has filtered through from Beau-
desert, where the butter and bacon comes from, and con-
cerns Miss Madeline Delpratt, of Tambourine Station, and
Mr. Wright, from Tenterfield, on your side of the streak
on the map.
The ingenuity with which Mr. Publiehouse pursues
advertisement is marvellous. Recently our voyaging
Premier and his kindly missis dropped in for a spell at the
Royal Victoria Hotel, Killarney, Ireland, and the landlord,
finding that wandering Queenslanders were getting into
the habit of going over that way, hit upon an ad. He
wrapped up a silver “Loving Cup” in brown paper, and
asked Kidston to convey it with his regards to the
municipality of Killarney, beside the Condamine River,
in Queensland. It cost a special train and a Ministerial
splash to take it to the local place. When the paper was
unwrapped the following inscription came to view
“From the old Killarney to the new. Presented by
John Maher Loughnan, Royal Victoria Hotel, Justice of
the Peace for Kerry, chairman of the urban district
council, Killarney, to the Municipality of Killarney,
Queensland.”
There isn’t even a . municipality to receive it, and one
has to be appointed right away. In the meantime a mere
Divisional Board protects the treasure.
Mrs. Kidston has evidently been indulging in Regent-
street shops. She returned in a confection of brown and
white stripes that astonished the natives, and went down
the bay on Saturday afternoon in a heliotrope wrapping
that was marked “ Miss Snipper, Court Costufniere, Fog-
land,” on every width. Also her terrible bonnets have
given way to quite fetching toques.
Free tea and music thrown in again inclined my steps
towards the Picture Show' on Thursday, when there was
more room to observe the work hung (and the work
that wanted hanging; until it was dead). I came
away faint with horror at the utter awfulness of
a canvas wherein two boys, minus everything
but a smile, and with limbs that had evidently been
dislocated upon a rack, were shown bathing among a
mass of palate-knife water hyacinths on a lumpy river
and under a bumpy sky. Going down the street I had to
hold on to a post lest my feelings should carry me away—
possibly to Wollongabba, where I didn’t want to go.
I find that the reported sale of our local Figaro has
been contradicted with great slaughter. Anyhow I only
said that the paper was going to change hands (which it
did), and that it would he bought by Mr. J. N. MacCallum
(which it was). I saw him—or his double—buying it at
the usual price from a boy in Queen-street, and when he
paid his coin the paper changed hands right enough. So
I take my stand violently on the literal accuracy of my
par.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEHI.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, October 19, 1908.
My Dear Yarrie,—
Immense regret is spreading itself over a dozen
families on account of the death of Mrs. John
Grice. The dame was very popular, and de-
servedly so, since she was essentially a “good
fellow.” She had a nice talent for being generous
and for being generous gracefully. To be generous
is a notable virtue, and to be generous gracefully
is far more notable. Pleurisy, intervening on
some minor ill, removed her from a world where
she will be much missed.
Mrs. Ernest Brooks and her husband, who have
been inspecting Java and Borneo and Ceylon with
rather bored eyes, hurry back to shine in Cup
week. The lady writes very little about the ter-
ritories she has crossed, but she brings back some
fabrics ecstatically embroidered with green beetle-
backs and sundries.
Bibron rushes about in mad excitement an-
nouncing the advent of a small Bibron. It is just
about last Cup time that he married one of the
handsome Charlwood sisters.
Melbourne can’t help grinning when it hears
that Sydney—or anywhere else, for that matter—
takes the Cats’ League Congress seriously. The
only political women here who are worth respect
are the determined dowds who graft in the Labor
cause, and have a man’s knowledge of party policy
and a tigerish courage in fighting for it. Our
cats aren’t a bit savage, except amongst them-
selves. There, apparently, they are, for we are
always hearing how Mrs. Tortiseshell resents Mrs.
Tabby’s patronising attitude, because Tortoiseshell
p&re kept a pub, and how Mrs. Tabby was induced
by another member to sink her prohibition preju-
dices and ask the lady whose ancestors smelled of
beer to a Tabby At Home. But the reports of
their discussions on a Censorship of Literature !
And on a Policy for the Commonwealth !!
Lawksamussy, it’s charming. The League doesn’t
admit to reading Victoria Cross except as a great
secret, and it candidly loves Edna Lyall. And it
runs a paper of its own, which, in the few places
where it isn’t; crying out about Janet Clarke, is
full of grammatical errors and misapplied adjec-
tives. Some of these days I’m going to get a
prominent Cat to tell me the league’s policy over
a mouse and a saucer of milk. The policy is a
haggard mystery which is freshly misinterpreted
by every politician who addresses the Cats’
Gathering.
I had porridge with Ada Crossley at Albury on
Tuesday morning, and from the depths of a
travelling coat blinked in yawning amazement at
the brisk freshness of the lady. A light and
delicate dust coat scarcely veiled the spring-bloom
gowning of the fresh, early-rising lady. She was
clad in mauve and green from top to toe, like a
lilac bush—outward effect and under-frill and in-
cidentals (such as stockings) all to match. She
wore a warranted-to-wash complexion and a pair
of sparkling eyes, also a posy of flowers. The
diamond lyre, a brooch Victoria gave her by
way of good-bye five years ago, refused
to add to the decoration so early in
the morning, and smashed its pin just
at the border line. There was a reception
beside the train at Wodonga, and, thence on, every
stopping station had its white-and-blue-sashed
cohorts shrilling out a local ode of welcome.
There was a reception at Spencer-street, still
another at the Town Hall, and again at the very
hotel. Someone remarked in the crush of the
Town Hall, “I do believe they are only doing it
for advertisement.” A manager-man, overhear-
ing, laughed hysterically and glanced at singer
Ada, mounted on a squashed platform, breathing
air thick as pea-soup, and shaking some thousand
hands with a bruised and bandaged paw, and a
smile like stage moonlight. “Pleasure, I assure
you,” he murmured.
That Town Hall Crossley reception was a
wonderful thing. There was standing room only,
and you were arrested if you grabbed your neigh-
bor’s air. The pressure was so great that four
persons were compressed into three, and now the
three have to divide the responsibility of support-
ing the fourth person’s widow and orphans among
them. The trouble is that they don’t know for
certain which was the fourth person. The Peter-
son women choir swarmed, bee-fashion, over the
platform and benches, and left a sheep-track for
the never-ending streak of pump-handling wel-
comers, whilst an orchestra piped perspiringly
from the far depths of the south balcony. Our
Ada was sheathed airily in Directoire lemon
silk. Orange plumes nodded from her hat,
and the diamond lyre (mended at lunch
time) blazed on her chest. The herd
that is described as “amongst those present
were Mrs. Smith and Miss Jones” only got
noticed by virtue of tallness. The small person
was left, and might as well have never been born.
She was supposed to be dead. Madge Mcln-
tosh, playing about before rehearsals of “She
Stoops to Conquer,” reared a haughty, copper-
topped head well above the pack. Outside, the
populace waited in a wedge for the contralto’s
carriage, and some blasting fiends just at the
Town Hall steps banged ou t Gatling guns in salute.
In fact, this week has been all Ada Crossley.
The meeting of her at Spencer-street was a flower-
bedecked affair. On a flowery dais erected on the
grim old station platform the gaud-Mayor and
gaudy-Mayoress received the visitor. The Henry
Butlers, the Willie-Softgoods Felsteads, the
Boomerang Joshuas, and a ring-a-ring-a-rosy of
other Importants were in attendance. A Gipps-
land mayoral duet from Sale brought an offering
of wild flowers from the Big Tree Land, where the
singer was born. Sister-in-law Mrs. Andrew
Muecke made a striking picture in white and
Wedgwood blue. She is a daughter of bank-
manager Braund, of Melbourne, but she lives in
Adelaide now that she has joined the Muecke clan.
The handsome Hughes puffed up in his motor.
Mrs. Meudell flared in vivid green like a spring
willow. Mrs. Palmer, Mrs. Christian and Miss
Pinschof (armed with a camera) were well in evi-
dence. Mrs. Grainger, decked in soft brown and
golden hair, shared in the reception, Percy mean-
while keeping his pansy eyes on mamma’s lug-
gage, The pretty little lady was journeying on
to Adelaide relatives that same day. Manager
Bracy and secretary Ted Tait helped the Only
Ada into her carriage, which bore her away in a
suitably tearful state as the band played “ Home,
Sweet Home.” That wearisome melody was
always the cue for Ada’s lace-edged hanky to go
up to her eyes last time she toured Australia, and
a good old habit of the sort is not easily con-
quered.
Some Savages, with their friends, relations and
fellow-cannibals, met on Monday afternoon in the
Lounge at Her Majesty’s to drink tea and confer
about the “ Society ” performance they are to give
at that theatre on the 30th. Mr. Manning and
Weston Pett made speeches, after whicli tickets
in large heaps were taken by enthusiastic sellers,
and arrangements were made to push on the
affair and make it a success.
Titheradge came over from the opening of the
Green Room Club to show his interest in the pro-
ceedings. Margaret Anglin sent Manager Nether-
sole. Mrs. E. J. Mackey, who had just returned
from christening new roads in the snows of
Buffalo Mountain, talked in staccato about the
gowns she is getting built, wherein she will appear
as the heroine of the piece.
Re “ Society,” George Titheradge speaks of a
strange experience he had one night long ago in
Sydney, when the Brough-Boucicault company
was giving the old comedy a revival. He was play-
ing Tom Stylus, and on this particular occasion he
felt very queer and ill. In fact, he felt as if
he didn’t care what happened. He saw
a doctor, who prescribed bed as a remedy
for a very bad attack of influenza. But
Titheradge refused to bed. As one tottering
in a dream, he got to the theatre and began to
act, and, having begun to act, he went on quite
mechanically to the end —unconscious of sur-
roundings or audience. He has no recollection
to this day of the play or of leaving the theatre.
But he reckons he must have left the theatre,
otherwise he would be there yet.
Nearly all the feminine world went to Caulfield
Cup in its coat and skirt. The new coat and skirt
is supremely swagger, hence the proceeding, for
the day felt like the shady side of the South Pole.
The part of the woman community that had not
the new tailor rig-out shivered dismally in new
chiffons that should have been seasonable, but
weren’t. A young and pretty bride in clam pink
crepe-de-chine, and her mother in chilly
mauve well-ventilated gear, held the lawn in
pale bleached wretchedness all day. You
could hear their teeth chattering above the
band. Heaven knows why they stayed, for
their interest in the racing was not keenly
obvious. A Mayfair belle wore little else than a
hat and a golden satin Directoire sheath over
tights. She was interesting going down the lawn
with a number of snap-shooters in pursuit, but
coming back against the wind the sight was
worthy of an orchestra stall. To hark back to the
up-to-the-moment tailorings—the nearer one gets
to a chessboard in skirtings the better, while the
coat is plain cloth of a shade to match. I half
expected the Fashionables to rise and skirl in
a mad Hieland dance, and show a bare knee or
so beneath the plaidies. Mrs. Ernest Raleigh
scored the biggest, blanketiest check. A fair girl
with Mrs. Armytage brought her blue to the
neatest, daintiest perfection ; she topped the rig-
out with a black plumed hat and a black toby
ruffle at her neck. The Carmichael lady looked
rather chilly. Her dress was willowy-green and
white; a pale blue-grey coat gave no apparent
warmth, and her severe black hat was also icily
unrelenting. Lord Dicky Nevill attended as
aide to nobody, the Dudley G.-G. having gone to
Fremantle to meet his lady—which was rather
sporting of his Lordship this tumultuous weather.
A less devoted husband might have made a run to
Adelaide by train suffice. There was a big mummer
crowd in evidence. Beatrice Day frisked about
in a smart sporting brick-red coat. Madge
Mclntosh wore a leather-bound dress that could
not well have been shorter.
Margaret Anglin is a real grafter. She is
mostly busy re-modelling and rehearsing when
other people play. “Twelfth Night” took up
her Cup Day. Manager Nethersole and Kolker
and Secretary Tait brought Miss Eileen Anglin,
Mrs. Kolker and Mrs. Tait. Sister Eileen was
well-muffled in a coat and scarf, and enveloped in
a drooping umbrella hat. Mrs. Kolker swept
about in pale tan Shantung and a pink-plumed
hat, whilst hubby wore a bulging coat and his arm
in a sling. Mrs. Eugenie Duggan Anderson
backed Maranui, and wreathed the lawn with her
smiles and black draperies. Mrs. Justice Isaacs
exploited strange draperies, like frozen gravy with
the fat in fantastic patterns. Mrs. Captain Payne
was another of the cold Pink’Uns. Pink is a ghast-
ly color on a shivery day. The lately-blossomed
Atherton maiden, Muriel, makes rather an
awkward angle for the smooth running of the
elder two, who were expected before this to be
running in other and double harness. The
youngest lady looked very pretty in white—fluffy,
woolly white—and held Jack McComas in leash.
Tettie Appleton capped a smart brown coat with
furiously fantastic Chinese roses. Mrs. Craven
wore a series of shouts, and daughter Widow
Brown was lost under a mammoth pink poppy
that hatted her golden hair. The Fenner
girls were two unassuming purple buds.
Mrs. Motor Kelly and Mrs. Frankie Oliver
Murray palled together in smart check gear.
Mrs. Doctor Hewlett walked in deadly conscious-
ness of her new-cut swallow-tail. A new bride,
Mrs. Charlie Beauchamp, looked a dainty vision
in dark blue Shantung. Mrs. Herbert Sargood
wore two big pincushions in a Tuscan hat as big
as a bazaar stall. Mrs. Donald Mackinnon en-
joyed the luxury of her most sensible morning
serge with a goodly glimpse of neat ankle. Some
hundreds of visiting medicoes and their feminine
belongings helped the crowd. Dr. M‘Arthur and
Dr. Hermann Laurence, with their two wives,
hosted at tea under the roses of the carriage
paddock. It knocked every other tea party into a
cocked hat. Everybody went to the Medicinal
Tea. Doctor and Mrs. Kenna, of Sydney, are
over, not only for the “ Meds’” congress, but for
four solid weeks of rest and frivol. Mrs. Kenna
wore the smartest of pale tan coats, and defied the
fashion and weather in the cutest of small hats,
netted in securely with a veil. The big plumed
hats that ventured out twisted and writhed in the
wind like funereal trappings.
A children’s fancy dress ball and a grown-up
reception were sprung as a home-coming .surprise
on Miss Jennie Brennan—that light-footed sprite
of a girl who teaches Williamson’s pantomime
fairieshow to work a full-fledged ballet, anddesigns
all their dances. Miss Brennan has been follow-
ing pantomime and child dances throughout Eng-
land and the Continent. Mrs. Brennan, all in
white, and the Weedon lady, in black and silver,
with the gaud-Mayor and Mr. Brennan, headed
the welcoming party. The children presented a
spider to Miss Brennan—a pearl spider, with its
many legs crusted in diamonds, and wicked rubies
for eyes. Miss Jennie received it in a Liberty
dress that was all a graceful soft blue.
Margaret Anglin caught her house with “Zira”
on Saturday night. She was practically the same
Zira, in the same beautiful black dress, who was
slumming in Sydney with sanctimonious Kolker-
Clavering. Margaret Anglin is never rigidly
conservative in detail. In the forcible third act,
instead of spitting her venomous tirade at the
Other Woman, flattened up against the wall likea
beautiful wicked snake, as she did in' Sydney,
the maddened Zira stalks the carpet, and risks
being over-thrown by her own intensity, without
any material support in her outburst. She plays
in her own hair. The Anglin hair is a beautiful
crown. When it was hidden under a shady black
wig, in “Camille,” the lower heaviness of the
artist’s face sagged into notice at once. When the
bright brown mane sweeps back naturally,
Margaret could easily pass for a beauty.
The House was a Race House. Two lonely men
boxed on one side, and Mrs. Manager Tallis enter-
tainedMiss Eileen, the copper-haired Anglin sister,
in a fetching black dress, and Mrs. Mummer Kolker,
with her Grecian curls banded in blue, and a pea-
cock-blue cloth coat covering a greenery-blue soft
dress. Every man’s glasses focussed on that box
during the evening. Mrs. Yallange and lengthy
hubby were right in the orchestra stalls. Mrs.
Raleigh, looking pale after her race day, was in
chilly colors in her usual seat. Hubby Ernest
wore a very close haircut. If he sits in the draught
of the stalls so religiously, he’ll become a Bald-
head.
The Armytages and the Maddens kept their
usual patch in the parterre, whilst Madge Mcln-
tosh, wreathed in Bacchanalian green leaves, held
a gay corner in the dress circle. Strangely enough
it was a man’s night—crow-like man’s gear where-
ever you looked. Possibly the women had
shivered themselves ill at the races. Behind the
scenes stageward, a whole cast cursed the defeat
of Bright Steel. A theatre syndicate, in which
the Anglin and Mr. Kolker had shares, drew
Bright Steel in Tatt.’s, and was counting its gains
for a day or two before the event.
From “Rosna,” who has her legal domicile in
Adelaide:—
Vice-royalty had another party for the Cherniavski
youngsters’ final concert, and, after the fray, the party
stayed behind to shake the picturesque performers by the
front extremity and ask them how they were bearing up.
At the train which took the company back to Melbourne
you couldn’t see an inch of landscape for crowd, and the
multitude was only consoled by the fact that the smallest
Russ, young Mischel of the large ’cello, was left in
Adelaide for a few days. He had to have some special
treatment for one of his hands that had got slightly
into disrepair. It had to be half-soled, or something like
that.
On Thursday morn the local Taffies hied them to
the hills, waylaid the gradual Melbourne express,
scrambled ori board, and pinned a badge securely
to every portion of the Welsh Choir they could
get hold of. It is a red dragon and green leeks
badge, with “Cymru” (which means Wales, in
case your education has been dropped down a crack some-
where) surmounting it, and is worn by all local Waters.
At Adelaide station more welcome was lying in W'ait, and
the visitors were carried off to have speeches shot at them
till further notice. After that the welcoming business
was dropped till Sunday, when 80 enthusiasts dragged the
Taffy choir for a trip through the hills, and finished up
with more of the speech incubus. At the first concert no
less than 400 descendants of the land that doesn’t wear
any vow'els in its alphabet took seats en bloc and encored
every item. The Welsh Choir sings divinely, and most of
it is called John Jones. The rest is Owen Ow'ens.
Now’, to add to all the other beauteous noises besetting
Adelaide, come “ The Red Mill ” and Fanny Dango, and
Olive Godwin and some beautiful high notes and heavenly
frocks. Red Mills are everywhere. They whirl their
arms in shop windows, and glare large and red from the
hoardings, and float small and scarlet down upon you on
the breeze in the shape of toy balloons. For w'eeks Ade-
laide has had nothing theatrical except Ladies who were
Lured to London, and the relief is so great that we’re
falling on the Red Mill’s neck, even as the Prodigal
Father fell on that of his offspring, whereby it broke in
three places, being weak through living on husks. '
Governors and Admirals were nearly as prevalent as
concerts and Red Mills in Adelaide last week. You
could hardly fire a cannon down Rundle-street without
killing a Governor or an Admiral. Admiral Sir Governor
Bedford dropped into S.A. on Thursday, and then swam
through the rain to the Britannia for home. Admiral
Sir Richard Poore, in his dear little Pa’hf’l, came sailing
gaily up the mighty gulf and wandered ashore to be
lunched and so on. Lord Dudley occasioned much
flourishing of red carpets and trumpets, and the
Challenger rushed into harbor to take him to Westralia,
also the Pegasus tore along to the anchorage to fire a few
salutes at him. Three Governors, two Admirals and most
of the navy were in South Oss at once 1 Do you wonder
we were excited ?
Clara Illeinschmidt, the girl with the wonderful con-
tralto voice, has been formed into a company called the
“Serena Trust,” with David Waite, Miss Waite and
Colonel Bass 6 as a Board or Plank to see to her interests,
and Arthur Laughton as secretary. A thousand shares
of €1 each have been issued, and are being seized with
avidity by' the moneyed populatio.n. It is a far better
plan than making a common or barnyard charity of the
damsel. She will be bound to the company for ten years
from the time of her leaving Adelaide to seek the best
available European tuition. As soon as she begins to
earn money, which she isn’t expected to do for four or
five years, she will also begin to pay back the company’s
capital and interest. Miss Waite, who is one of a
moneyed clan, accompanies her to Britain to put her on
the road to fame ; and as she has voice, brains, tempera-
ment, physique, presence, only 18 years of life behind
her, and the necessary cash ahead of her, we expect her
to storm the ramparts of Fame and shake things up.
Our Excellencies have definitely booked their passages
for England, and they sail on December 31. Sundry fare-
well frolics are on hand. Invitations are out for a garden
festivity on the Residence lawns on November 10. Each
card is accompanied by a printed statement to the effect
(though not in these words) that w'hen the card includes
Mr., Mrs. and Miss Smith, and Miss Smith is unable to
attend through violent indigestion due to undue con-
sumption of cheese the previous night, her name is to be
blotted off the fair surface of the document. When the
document is brought along it is to correspond exactly
with the number and description of the people who
accompany it. The document is to be brought along—
not negligently left at home. And, finally, the document
is to be deposited carefully in the hand of the private
secretary, which will be held out to receive it. Pre-
sumably this method is intended to quench the habit,
prevalent with some folk in S.A., of going to functions to
which they have never been invited.
The fancy dress frolic of Miss Lucy Turnbull’s pupils
in the Town Hall on the 16th was a blithe proceeding. All
the local infantry were there, and we defy any other
village to produce a more beauteous array of youngsters.
The dancing of the very small babes was a thing of joy ;
the way the midgets waltzed and barn-danced and
lancered without a hitch was uncanny. Miss Turn-
bull was arrayed as “ Night ” in a handsome
black shimmery gown and powdered hair. Among
her band of brigands, bushmen, soldiers, sailors,
fishwives and fairies, and all the rest, were the two lovely
Scarfe infants, as fairy and French peasant; a quaint little
Astley milkmaid ; a Cave baby and a Woolls infant as
dolls, little Molly-Oraven-quite-contrary, and a Jolly
child as something in the lolanthe line. Among the
larger girls, Marjory Eyre as Evangeline had all eyes
fixed on her graceful young person.
The braw Scots, ye ken, gied a gran’ concert
at the Town Hall on Friday (23rd). The Cale-
donian Society certainly means to enjoy a riotous
time of dissipation and anticipation between now
and Christmas. On the 31st there is to be Hal-
lowe’en for the bairns, when the bonnie tartan-
ettes are to “ look out for the champit tatties and
dookin’ for apples.” And on Nov. 30 the council of
the C.S. will hold a combined haggis supper and
smoke concert, in honor of Saint Andrew which
occasion is to be distinguished by the presence of
State-Gov. Carmichael. The “dookin’for apples ’
is to happen at the Masonic Hall. 1

Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.

I bought a box, and since that time have never

“Hamer”: I have my doubts now about “Lola” and
“ Lucette,” who write for “ The Woman’s Page.” It all
came about through the confidence reposed in me by a
freelance of my acquaintance, an uncouth, ruffian who
always has enough money to get drunk on, and whose
language is the most picturesque thing between
here and Babylon. In response to an envious re-
mark, he told me the secret of his prosperity. He
was a regular contributor to various “ Pages for Women,”
and had just had published an article on the use of
muslin draperies for making rooms artistic and pretty.
For muslin drapery purposes my ruffian friend was
“Mignonette.” He assured me that the stuff, when you
got used to it, is the easiest in the world to write ; and,
although payment is often small, acceptance is prac-
tically certain. Why? Well, he guessed that the really
smart woman writer prefers to write almost anything
rather than stuff of the muslin drapm\ variety; and that’s
probably true. Anyway, I alway- call him “ Pearldrop ”
these times. That touching little, shy article on “The
Mother-in-Law I should Like,” which he showed me one
day, was signed “ Pearldrop.”

“ Stony Broke ” : I note that- “Wayfarer” complains
(B. 10/9/’08) thuswise : “When you leave sunny Aus-
tralia you pay all sorts of prices for the blushing pink
sheet, whose name I shan’t mention except by accident.”
Let me tell “ Wayfarer ” that it is not necessary for him
to leave Australia to achieve the feat mentioned—pro-
vided he is mug enough to let himself be made the sport
of the inequitable andgrasping newspaper vendor. On my
arrival at Largs Bay, Adelaide, from England last May,
after a brief holiday, I spied a person selling the above-
mentioned paper on the wharf. I tendered him a two-
shilling piece, and he gave me a pink paper and a shilling
in exchange. When I demanded further coin, he
explained that he had to pay a toll for selling papers on
the quay of the Outer Harbor, and so charged Is. for
his w T ares. Thereat I spake harsh words to him in the
vernacular of the country, so that he no longer took me
for a fresh chum. And having' tong'ue-lashed him to
rights, I demanded my money back, and, spurning all his
efforts to assuage my rage, I strode ashore, and there
acquired the sheet which “Wayfarer” refuses to men-
tion—got it for the reasonable sum of one sprat sterling.

When Northcliffe (nie Harmsworth) recently bought a
bit of the Times, the Nation went to the trouble of finding
out what journals were already owned or controlled by the
Harmsworth family. The little lot numbers well over 50,
and includes nine dailies, six weeklies, eight boys’ papers,
six girls’ papers, five “ comic ” papers for youngsters, six
Sunday papers, four monthly magazines, and several pub-
lications of the awful Answers type, besides story papers
and novelettes of the tripe variety.
* * * *
“C.’s” carp: Seems to me the time has arrived for
someone to rise and ask, “Is the Times God? ” On every
imaginable topic of public concern the London Times ex-
presses an editorial opinion, and that opinion is promptly
cabled to this continent as if it were the utterance of the
Creator, and, consequently, the last word on the subject.
So far as the public knows, the Times is a somewhat old-
fashioned, grandmotherly, essentially plutocratic, Tory
print, edited by a gentleman named Buckle, and finan-
cially engineered by some Tory gentlemen named Walter,
who have recently quarrelled among themselves over the
conduct of their paper. Is anyone, nowadays, concerned
with what the Times has to babble on current questions
and affairs? In the days when newspapers were few, the
movements and opinions of public men little known, and
the world’s murders and divorces a matter of mere garbled
hearsay, the Times had its uses ; and it served its day and
generation well. But now—outside a small coterie of
gentlemen who write leaders for the daily press, and
search the earth for ideas for their leaden effusions—not
one man in ten thousand cares two figs what the Times
says or leaves unsaid. On behalf of a fairly numerous
crowd, therefore, I rise and ask the cable-man to switch
off the Times as a subject of no particular importance.
“ Wanderer ” : There are two possible explanations of
the irreligion of the daily pressman. One is that he is
better informed than his fellow beings, and the other is
that his business brings him into contact with religion in
its least attractive aspect. He associates it with work,
and dry work at that. I remember once, in a big English
city, reporting a meeting over which Dr. Dowie’s first
lieutenant or second in command presided. The papers
had been ridiculing the Dowieites, and the speaker com-
menced by cursing the pressmen present with a curse
that made the blood run cold and the hair stand up like
the panoply of the quillful porcupine. The ladies there
looked so sorry for us that the viee-Dowie presently re-
lented somewhat, and added that if we aided the work in
future we might be saved ; otherwise the certain and
positive temperature of the Hereafter was 2719 degrees. I
got some rather humorous copy out of that meet-
ing, so according to the Dowie person I’m
done for in the next world. Perhaps that’s why
I’ve given up trying to be good. If a pressman is writing
anything on Salv’army matters, and cornes across any of
the female soldiers in his search for information, there’s
invariably an attempt at conversion. But it’s against
Temperance people and the small hard sects that we have
the bitterest grudge. They’re always giving banquets,
and the banquets are always on the Cold Tea basis. I
shall never forget the look that came over the face of the
secretary at a recent Temperance function in Sydney
when he caught the whiff of an ante-prandial refresher
while I was asking him the names of the speakers. From
a reporter’s point of view, the Roman Catholics are the
most hospitable ; neither do they look askance at the
infidel of the pencil. Often let it be set down to their
credit, they offer him spirituous refreshment. But for
preference, give me a Licensed Victuallers’ banquet!
Some months ago a Sydney literary jester, wandering
at large in rural parts, met a real bush poet. The poet
was young and simple, and when the jester warned him
that he was liable to a heavy fine for writing poems
without a license, he inquired what steps were necessary
to obtain one. The jester gave him the address of a
Sydney artist and told him to write and make formal
application, also to enclose specimen poems for perusal
by the Comptroller of Poets. The confiding poet knew
there were laws about catching fish and shooting wild
duck, so the news that there were laws about writing
poems didn’t surprise him. He set to work and
wrote several poems and the respectful application
printed below. These he duly posted to the address
given him and, after an interval, received a most elabor-
ate charter, beautifully engrossed and decorated. The
literary jester had composed it, and it was illuminated by
the artist. The impressive document empowered the
applicant to write poems in all styles save one—the elegiac.
Under the most awful penalties, he was solemnly en-
joined never to pen an elegy. No reason was given for
the prohibition ; he was simply commanded to refrain for
ever from composing elegiacal poems. The magnificent
document may still be carefully preserved, or it may have
been burnt long ago. But, in either case, the owner still
remains the only licensed poet in Australia. Here is his
application and one of the poems that won him the dis-
tinction :
“ Dear Sir, —
“ I the undersigned hereby apply for a poet’s license,
hoping it will be granted as soon as possible I also en-
close my first piece of poetry entitled the Spy.
“ I remain yours truly,
“ Job Cow.”
THE SPY
(An incedent of the Franco Prussian war)
It was a hot night in warm july
When I was acting as a Prussian Spy
I was watching two men from where I stood
And from their talk they meant no good
As I Stood watching there that night
The moon was shining very bright
And all of a moment I saw a sight
That made me shiver all over with fright
They were French I could plainly see
I also knew they after me
One showed a dagger and cursed my name
They other assented and did the same
This unnerved me just a little
It almost made my heart blood tide
I knew no mercy would be shown to a spy
So I made up my mind to do or die
My sword from its sheath I drew
And at one’s ugly face I flew
And with one thrust sharp and deep
I sent that villian for ever to sleep.
Right at the other then I rushed
And with my sword his scull I crushed
Then I drew it out from his gory hide
And Replaced it gently by my side.
Ifc moves ! Mines Minister Gregory, of
Newton-Moore’s State Frights Government in
Westralia, lost the number of his mess at the
recent elections ; and at Menzies he explained
how the accident happened :
The large vote recorded against the Government on the
o-oldfields was due to the strong Federal feeling which
existed there. Even among his own supporters there
were those who believed that it would be wise to abolish
the State Parliament, and he feared the feeling was
growing.
Naturally; for the goldfields man is an Aus-
tralian, and when he sees small insects buzzing
around the head of the Australian Government,
and harassing it, and making progress difficult
and sometimes impossible, the goldfields man
of course wants to kill the insects.
OBSESSION!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The ill-used word “obsession” (meaning literally “a
besieging ”) has become almost a fetich with modern
writers. It is now scarcely possible to take up a news-
paper or book without coming across it in some place or
other.— News item.
With a sense of sore oppression,
And a wail of deep depression,
I unfold this tale of woe.
’Tis that awful word “ Obsession,”
That induces this digression,
And weighs down my spirit so.
Ever since its first accession,
Every author in succession
Of it fonder seems to grow ;
While the pen-and-ink profession,
Vote it such a fine possession,
That its use they can’t forego !
In the Parliamentary session,
There I note the same transgression,
As the words of wisdom flow.
(’Tis my confident impression,
If the members made confession,
They its meaning do not know !)
It has made such swift progression,
That I pray for its egression
To the regions down below.
Hence I make this intercession
(And by way of short digression),
Ask the aid of friend and foe
To wipe out this word Obsession
From their literary expression,
And give other words a show.
(’Tis a very small concession,
If it makes for its decession
From the inky puppet-show !)
So choke out this word Obsession—
Let there be no fresh incession—
And your pedantry outgrow.
Bang it out without aggression,
But insist on its suppression—
And a boon on man bestow !

SPORTING
NOTIONS
After Welcome Triat had run away with the
Ooongy Handicap on the Wednesday he appeared certain-
on paper —to beat everything bar Pink’Un for the Caulfield
Cup. The Ooongy, like the Eclipse Stakes, is an 11-fur-
long test, and the winner or runner-up in one or other of
these races has in many cases added a Cup to his credit.
In 1900 Clean Sweep won the Ooongy Handicap and Mel-
bourne Cup. In 1901 Hymettus ran second in the Eclipse
Stakes before winning Caulfield Cup. In 1902 Vanity
Fair won the Ooongy and was placed in both the Cups.
In 1903 Wakeful won the Eclipse and was second in Mel-
bourne Cup. In 1904 Acrasia finished second for the
Ooongy and first) for Melbourne Cup. In 1905 Marvel
Loch won the Eclipse and the Caulfield Cup. In 1906
Poseidon won the Eclipse and both Cups, and in 1907
'Poseidon again won the Eclipse and the Caulfield Cup,
whilst Apologue won the Coong.v, ran second for the
‘Caulfield and won the Melbourne Cup. This year Alaiva
and Knox and Welcome Trist and Wooroonia filled the
‘first two places in the test events, but the Cup pretensions
of Knox and Wooroonia are hardly worth considering.
* » * *
Maranui shaped like a genuine stayer at Caul-
field. In the leading division all the way, the son of
Malatua and Grafin went to the front at the right
moment, won with a bit in hand, and was as cool as a
summer drink 15 minutes afterwards. In the Melbourne
Cup he will meet Tulkeroo on only 41b. worse terms, and
although the latter has already proved himself able to go
two miles and is a handsomer fellow than Maranui, he
seems to have none the best of it for the Cup that
is to come against his recent conqueror. To the
writer’s way of thinking, the winner and runner-up at
Caulfield have equal chances (allowing for the winner’s
penalty) in the Melbourne Cup. Post Town will meet
Maranui on 81b. and Tulkeroo on 41b. better terms than
last Saturday, and he would look as dangerous as either
of them but for the doubt as to whether he is built to stay
a Melbourne Cup race right out. True, Post Town won
the big two-mile event at Perth, but his weight was only
7st. 91b., and the time was not up to the best Flemington
records. Rather long-backed and narrow-waisted, he is
probably not quite good enough to beat a first-class field,
and the field for this next Melbourne Cup promises to be
l ard to beat.
Assuming that Maranui did himself justice in
the Metropolitan at Randwick a fortnight earlier, his vic-
tory at Caulfield goes mainly to prove that Mooltan and
Peru are the picks among all the older horses in the Mel-
bourne Cup. They beat him badly in the Met., and
Should do it again next Tuesday week. Also Tulkeroo’s
good performance at Caulfield goes to confirm this im-
pression, seeing that Peru, as a three-year-old, beat
Tulkeroo in the Australian Cup last March, and has
evidently improved with age. They have a chance, these
Caulfield Cup horses, for the two-miles event. But the
Metropolitan “ form ” is more impressive, and at time of
writing the prospects of Mooltan are second to none.
A trio of three-year-olds started for the Caul-
field Cup, and Baw Bee ran best of them, coming towards
the front whilst Mother Goose was dropping back. Here,
as in the Sydney Derby, Baw Bee showed stamina rather
than speed, but seemingly the colt is not in the same
class as Parsee and Alawa, whose “ form,” compared with
that of the seasoned horses, is thus far a matter of conjec-
ture only.
This year’s Caulfield Cup, a fast run race con-
sidering' the rather heavy state of the course, was seem-
ingly as free from jostlings and individual misfortunes as
one could expect to have it. Among the nags that
Started with the disadvantage of outside positions,
Welcome Trist was conspicuously unable to make a for-
ward movement, whilst of the few that were always in
the foremost half of the field Pink ’Un appeared to get a
nasty bump at the turn for home.. All the same, there
was no obvious reason why Pink ’Un should not
have subsequently reasserted himself if he had been
capable of staying the full 12 furlongs. Probably
he had already begun to tire when the bump
happened. The honors of the pace-making were
with the hot-headed lolaire, who took a decided
lead before they had gone a furlong, and kept it right up
to the distance post, after which he struggled on and
finished third, less than two lengths behind the winner.
For the rest, Maranui, the winner, was always among the
leading six, and always a bit in froni of Tulkeroo and
Post Town, who finished second and fourth respectively.
Jack Smith showed prominently, but tired earlier than
lolaire. Enchanteur and the grey Destinist performed
not quite so well as Jack Smith, and of those not men-
tioned none did anything to speak of. In all 22 horses
started. Maranui, bn the strength of a good trial, was
backed down to 6to 1. lolaire went out at 10’s and 12’s.
Tulkeroo dropped back to 20 to 1, and Post Town was not
fancied.
The most unreasonable circumstance of the
Caulfield Cup market was the backing of Enchanteur
down to 10 and 12 to one. On paper, Enchanteur had no
pretensions to beat his stable companion, Post Town, but
when the trainer tried them, with four others, on the
Wednesday before the race, Enchanteur ran clean away
from the opposition, and was then reckoned a real good
thing. Accepting the trial as a true one, Enchanteur’s
revelation of speed and stamina was utterly inconsistent
with his previous mediocrity; nevertheless the stable
put a lot of money on the elderly gelding. The trial
could not have been true. In the Cup it was Post Town
who ran up to public expectations, finishing a good
fourth. Enchanteur, the hero of the private gallop, died
away to nothing at the finish.
* * * *
N.S.W. has now gathered four Caulfield Cups
in succession. Prior to Maranui, Marvel Loch and
Poseidon (twice) won. Before that, N.S.W. nags home
first were: Master Avenal (1881), Paris (1892 and 1894),
Waterfall (1895), Cremorne (1896), Amberite (1897), and
Dewey (1899). » * *
Re the letter M and the season’s big turf things.
Melodrama and Mooltan won Epsom and Metrop, and
Maranui (McLachlan up) appropriated Caulfield Cup.
Will Mooltan (McLachlan in the saddle) annex Melbourne
Cun? Mooltan is a warm favorite, and looks likely.
r * * « *
“Ancient”: On his showing in the Metrop.,
Maranui looked specially good for the Caulfield Cup, but
he had disappointed more than once in important events.
For the big A.J.C. lj-mile race, Maranui was last off at
barrier rise, and was still last when two furlongs on the
journey, but subsequently he worked up and went round
several of the field, to finish third. He was bred, and is
owned and trained, by Mr. Dan O’Brien, who has figured
prominently in M.L. and N.S.W. turf things during the
past 25 years. It was Dan O’Brien who bought Carbine
as a two-year-old. Foaled in M.L., Maranui’s pedigree is
Australian—by Malatua (Malua —Faithful) from Grafin,
by Carbine from Loval Peeress, by The Peer from Loyal
Devoir (imp.) by trumpeter. Grafin first saw light in
Victoria—bred bv the late Mr. D. S. Wallace. As a yearling
she brought 150g5., and at three years old 105g5., Mr.
Dan O’Brien being the latest buyer.
* * * *
Alawa, winner of the Eclipse Stakes at Caul-
field, is one of the handsome, sturdy sort, built on the
lines of his sire, Malster, who won the V.R.O. Derby, and
ran second to his stable companion, Clean Sweep, for
Melbourne Cup. With Parsee out of the way, Alawa
would look pretty certain to follow his dad’s lead as
regards the Derby, and his Cup chance is a very good
one, judging from his strong run at the end of the 11
furlongs in the Eclipse Stakes. But this performance
goes also to prove the quality of Parsee, who kicked his
heels to Alawa in the Caulfield Guineas (one mile), and had
previously shown his stamina in the A.J.O. Derby. Some
people, to be sure, thought that Alawa might have
finished closer to Parsee in the Guineas if he had made
his run earlier. The writer could see no reason to doubt
that the Svdney colt won easily. It looks as though
Alawa is unlucky in having been born in the same season
as the speedy son of Metal. #
The Australian Hunters’ Cup, on the “ off’’day
of the Caulfield Cup meeting, is always an interesting
event, although it usually happens that the top weights
are too good for the rough ’uns. The gees are bona fide
hunters, ridden by amateurs; the course is 29 furlongs,
and the pace not fast enough to cause many accidents at
the jumps. This year, Player (13st. 101 b.) won easily
enough, giving as much as 3st. 101 b. to the bottom-
weights, and because he waited on the leaders for three
miles the jockey, Mr. Dean, got special mention for
riding a judicious race. As a matter of fact, some of the
others were equally well handled, and, taking it all
round, the display of amateur riding seemed quite
characteristic of Australia. *
Letter P looks very dangerous for the Mel-
bourne Cup. Peru, Pink ’Un, Post Town, Pharos, Perkeo
and Parsee would be backed at considerable odds against
any other six horses with any given initial letter to their
names. The M’s are another strong division—Mooltan,
Maranui, Mazarin, May King, Monobel, etc.
* * * *
The Spring meetings so far held have forced
from Patrick Moses considerable of the spoil accumulated
by him during the previous many months when results
were mostly his way ; but punters are not likely to get
anvthing near all their own back—severely reduced
prices will stop that. Sydney City Tatt.’s. meeting
(Saturday), despite rain and resultant adverse conditions,
saw four favorites and a strong second choice successful,
but the last winner—Gold Pan—might have dropped
from the clouds for all the great majority of backers
knew about him, and his win was as balm of Gilead to the
sore-hearted bag person.

Parson ,T. J. North, the Baptist gentleman who
denounced the tote as a “ bookmaker without brains,” is
a fair sample of the churchy defender of Isaac Bag. Does
Parson North really argue that the practice of book-
making is a brain-building exercise? If so, he should
advocate the practice of burglary, spieling and other
criminal practices. Theyall develop resource and mmble-
ness of intellect in those who follow them. It is just
because it is a bookmaker without brains, avarice, or
ability to square jockeys and stiffen horses that the tote
is desirable. It is a form of gambling in which the public re-
ceives back the great bulk of the money invested, whereas
with the bookmaker the larger portion goes into. the
pockets of a small class of men, many of whom spend it in
leading lives that the Rev. ,T. J. North cannot in his
parsonical capacity recommend to his flock as pood ex-
amples, however much he may admire them personally.
But the great overwhelming reason why every good
citizen should vote for the replacement of the bookmaker
bv the totalisator is that it cuts at the root of the nefari-
ous system of book betting. With the tote a man can
gamble on the racecourse only, and, moreover, he has to
put up the monev when he bets. With the bookmaker he
can make bets at any hour of the day and most hours of
the night, any and every day of the week. Also, if he is
a regular customer, he can book his bets, and thus gamble
beyond bis means, land himself into difficulties over what
are called “debts of honor,” and be tempted to “make
it up” by either robbing his employer or his wife and
family. Few men tnke money from the till to po to tne
course and fewer still will tell the wife in advance that
Jackv must run barefooted for a week because his father
is going to have a flutter on a horse. With credit-
betting men drift unconsciously into impossible positions,
and then thev stand bet ween the devil of failing to pay
“ a debt of honor” and the deep sea of dishonesty. Just
because there is no credit-bettinp about the tote, it has a
tendency to reduce the volume of gambling.
Sydney’s most popular yachting body, the
Prince Alfred Y. 0., is once more afloat. It commenced
operations on Friday night last with a “ mess dinner in
St James’ Hall, the catering being carried out by the
Paris House people. Any P.A.Y.O. dinner is an enjoy-
able function ; there is about it a breezy atmosphere of the
briny sea and the joyousness of sea-going youth. On
Saturdav the squadron held its opening day, when Vice-
Commodore Norman Murray hoisted his flag on the steamer
Premier and led his fleet to the lee of Point Piper, wnere he
sivnalled that most welcome of all signals “Come aboard,
and they came with alacrity. There was an excellent
band, many beautifully-dressed girls, and a wealth of
refreshment. The outings of the P.A.Y.O. are among the
brightest spots of a Sydney summer, and all followers of
yachting are glad begun. #
In Saturday’s open boat sailing on Sydney
Harbor, Christian Webb, in the Australian, got off one of
his masterpieces bv running clean through the fleet
before turning the first corner of the triangle. Thence-
forward it was a procession, with the rear boats fighting’
for inferior places. The Australian won easily, with the
Zena, Eileen and Vision behind in that order. It was a
rainy afternoon with a light, spasmodic breeze from
E.S.-E. ,

There are some low characters in and around
Wanganui (M.L.). Arnst sent his boats up by a truck,
and they were left out exposed to the weather all night.
Some ruffian removed the ropes and turned the craft
adrift, after fastening to them most uncomplimentary
notes, one of which declared that it was like Arnst s
cheek to come to Wanganui to row a man of the skill and
genius of Webb. Fortunately the night was fine, and the
boats came to no injury. Webb is very sore over the
actions of his alleged friends, and expressed his opinion
of them in language as vigorous as his rowing. Betting
has started, all the Arnst money available being snapped
up at evens. Arnst’s backers asked for odds, but the
Webb party declined. So Arnst’s chances must be look-
ing somewhat rosy.

Maoriland rower Whelch, who is after Ben
Thoroughgood’s scalp, has arrived at Raymond Terrace
(N.S.W.), and expressed himself as pleased with the
course. He and Thoroughgood went up in the same boat,
and became bosom friends. The gigantic Ben could not
keep his eyes off the little man who has come, if all that
is said of him is true, to wrest the championship of Aus-
tralia from Australian hands. The disproportion between
their sizes seeins to have hit the big Cornstalk where he
lives. If there is anything in the doctrine that a good
big.man will whip a good little man, Whelch has no hope
—but, then, Hanlan was a small man, and he whipped a
lot of them. Writer once heard a Canadian say it wasn t
Bill Beach but the beastly Australian hospitality that
walloped Hanlan and deprived him of the championship
of the world. Anyhow, it’s a pity that the Thoroughgood-
Whelch race is to take place on the Hunter The
chances are that both men would have benefited financi-
ally had it been fixed for the Parramatta.
The defeat ofGeorge Towns for the Sportsman’s
Cup and championship of England by a length and a half
at the hands of Ernest Barry, who broke the world s
record doing it, has roused a hope that the new champion
will come to Maoriland and have a go at the winner ot
the Arnst-Webb contest. But so far the Englishman has
not held out any hope that he will do so.
* * *
The narrow squeak by which the University
and Leichhardt crews escaped being run down by a fool
steamer carrying spectators, at the Sydney sRe atta
on the Parramatta River last Saturday, should lead to
strict enforcement of the rule that all spectator boats
shall keep astern of the judge’s vessel. Nothing hap-
pened except that a good race was spoiled, but it came
very close indeed to being* a tragedy.
The hostility of Sydney suburban councils to
tennis is a thing beyond comprehension. Council after
council has refused to allow any portion of the parks and
reserves to be utilised as tennis courts, although there are
no objections to the same grounds being used for cricket,
baseball, lacrosse, football, or any other old game which
is confined to the harder sex. Even quoits are
But tennis is anathema. The reason is, apparently, that
tennis is regarded as a pastime of the snobocracy—whicn
is foolish. It is, excepting golf and croquet, the only
outdoor game at which the sexes can mix, and is one of
the most healthful games that either man or woman can
indulge in. As a developer of muscle and agility it is
equal to skipping, and much more entertaining—skip-
ping, as almost everybody knows, being one of the most
important parts of a boxer’s preparation. Also, tennis is
a valuable game from a national point of view ; it implies
the mingling together under healthy conditions of the
voting people of both sexes, and the tennis court is a splen-
did recruiting ground for the Registrar of Marriages.

N. S. Wales League of Wheelmen recently
arranged a road cycle race from Nowra to Sydney, a dis-
tance of 92 miles, but just as things were looking rosy the
North lUawarra Council intimated that it would prose-
cute any cyclists who travelled over its roads at more
than regulation velocity. This knocked the race kite
hio-h, as the North lUawarra Council’s territory forms a
considerable portion of the distance to be raced over.
The League proposed to meet the difficulty by putting
the riders under control while passing through the
objecting council’s jurisdiction, but that is a useless
device. A race which doesn’t race isn’t worth having,
and unless the council can be brought round the event
had better be abandoned, or laid out over another course.

Although there was no rain in Melbourne last
Saturday afternoon, sufficient fell the previous week to
fracture the possibilities of any brilliant batting. The best
performance was that of Richmond, which, on its own
comparatively dry ground, made 191 for seven wickets
against South. Melbourne met Northcote on the Ware-
housemen’s ground (the M.C. ground being in a sad state
of boo), and hit up 181 under difficulties, after having
disposed of N’cote for 46. Armstrong, as usual, was the
main support of his side, with top score, 44, and top
bowline* average, seven for 18. East, which went over to
Toorak to do battle with P’ran, was walloped down for
71 P’ran howler Kvle being mostly responsible for the
walloping, with eight for 29. P’ran itself could only
manage 95 for nine wickets, Smith (50 not out)
and Sundries (19) averting utter disgrace. As for
Fitzroy, it gave Carlton the surprise of its life.
The Carltonians, winning the toss, sent Roy
in on doubtful-looking turf, fully expecting (as Carlton
had the services of the deadly Saunders) the merest of
routs. ’Roy, however, made 178, and dismissed three of
Carlton for six runs. The case of St. Hilda v. North Mel-
bourne stands part heard with Saints seven for 139;
while University, after getting Essendon all out for /5,
has responded with one for 95—which signifies a one-
innings victory for the students, anyway.

Saturday’s rain played Ancient Henry with
Sydney cricket, all but two first-grade matches being
abandoned and reckoned as drawn games. The match
between Redfern and North Sydney was a srecially-
interesting fixture, as Redfern, having compiled 285,
seemed to have a fairly good chance of defeating the
premiers. All Redfern was anxious to see how its crack
bowler, Emery, would smash up the northern wickets,
and rolled up, anxiously watching the sky. The
skv wept, and there was no business done. Waverley
and Glebe plaved out their engagement under damp
and unpleasant conditions. Waverley had three wickets
down, and wanted 170 runs to win. Glebe’s trundling
was deadly, and only 162 of the necessary runs vvere made.
Sydney continued the match against Middle Harbor on
the grassy green of Manly. Middle Harbor had closed its
innings with 398 for a loss of six wickets the previous
Saturday, and Sydney started in a horrible light, and on
a sodden wicket, to wipe off the long handicap. Two bare-
sark hitters, Pite and Richardson, smacked up 201 in two
hours, and changed the aspect of things considerably.
When the light failed absolutely at 5.50 p.m. Sydney had
made 257 for the loss of two wickets, and the game was
declared a draw. Central Cumberland defeated Burwood.
The result of the upheaval is that Glebe and
Central Cumberland head the procession with five com-
petition points each. Balmain, University, North Syd-
ney and Burwood are level with two points each.
Waverley is nil. Gordon, Middle Harbor, Sydney, Red-
fern, Petersham, and Paddington are all something less
than nothing. Which is a deplorable job.

Otago (M.L.) Cricket Association proposes to
import a couple of “leading” Australian cricketers to
show the local idea how to do things. _ Probably there
are iust as good coaches in Maoriland as in Australia, for
the fact that a man is a good cricketer doesnt prove he
is a good coach, by any means. Still, it is better than
sending to England for mentors, as some associations
have done. • „

The National Rifle Association meeting at
Rindwick (N S. W.) last week produced some remarkable
shooting. G. Hudson, of St. Arnaud (Vie.), caused a
shiver to creep through the spine with a continuous run
of 32 bull’s-eyes at the 500yds. range ; win e W. O.
Coulter (Tramway Club) scored 18 successive bulls and E.
W Priddle 16. The rules of the Association provide that
the firer shall go on until he gets out of the bull.
The champion medal of the Association was won by
Stan Edwards (N.S.W.), who also won the Kings -
the richest prize of the meeting, worth £10(). In
the “King’s” (66 shots at seven distances), Edwards
scored 312 points out of a possible 330 ; . A. fc °°£
second prize of £25 with a score of 306, and G. Usher
gathered in £l5 through being third on the list with a
total of 305. Taken right through the shooting was very
accurate, and the frequent “possible scores should
cause the Association to ponder over the advisability of
reducing the size of the optic of the cow s father.
The “business” part of the N.R.A. meeting-
popping at the “running man” al ? d the dis '
appearing person,” with a large bull s e.i
represent a vulnerable spot —was very popular
It isn’t the most accurate shot at the rigid
target who is the best rifle-shot. The Holmes
aggregate (a compilation of the shots at the moving
figures) gave the £lO prize to R. W Ackland with a score
ofH2; S. Edwards taking second prize with a, total of
104. Newington College, which has gathered in all the
schools’ challenge rifle matches this season, won the
Schools’ Challenge Shield with a score of 552. Sydney
Grammar School came next with a score 0f,516 , and the
rest of the schools toiled a long way in the tear.
Young’ (Stanley) Ketchel, the wonder-boy, the
“man-killer,” the lad who was going to make Thomas
Brusso Burns wish he had never abandoned the pence of
lacrosse for the quids of stoush, has been licked to the
world on points, and subsequently knocked out by Billy
Papke. It looks as though Ketchel were an over-boomed
pug. The list of capable men of his weight or thereabouts
that he hasn’t met is of great length. It includes Hugo
Kelly, Mike Schreck, Jack O’Brien, Sam Langford, and
Jack (Twin) Sullivan. Ketchel must be an exceptionally
game and taking fighter; yet it is hard to realise how, in
default of his having tried conclusions with the genuine
top-botchers, he was raised to such a pitch in the public
esteem that people clamored to lay four to one on him
against a formidable proposition like Papke. True, Ketchel
had previously beaten Papke at Milwaukee, but onlookers
agreed at the time that the luck was with the new man.
The just-defeated one must have a marvellous stock of
courage. To be staggered, as he was, with a terrific
cross to the head, to be floored a second later by a blow
on the chin, to be thereafter battered to the earth five
several times, and all within one round, and that the
first; and despite it to struggle on for 11 more rounds
argues the possession of something unique in the way of
tenacity and fighting instinct. #
“D.”: !SaysSydney Referee (14/10/’08): “Pat
O’Keefe (Tommy Burns’ trainer) fought Papke, who re-
cently defeated so convincingly Stanley Ketchel for the
middle-weight championship of the world, six rounds (no
decision), at Philadelphia on November 9 last year. What
price Pat against Ed. Williams and 00. on that form ? ”
It’s not often the Referee makes a slip in boxing matters,
but it does it here. No possible line can be taken from
Pat O’Keefe’s six rounds (No Decision) battle at Phila-
delphia. Philadelphia is a city where the local law says
that in anv fight that goes six rounds the verdict shall
be “No Dc.’,” no matter how the principals shaped.
Thus top-notcher John (Unk)Russell, of Philadelphia, who
has fought most of his contests in the city of his birth,
has--out of about 70 fights waged there—no less than 61
“No Dc.” battles to his credit. In the remaining 19 dis-
turbances he knocked his opponent out before or during
the 6th round on every occasion but one. If there were
anything in the “ No Dc.” Philadelphian argument, come-
dian Joe Grim, the.orator-pug, would be lethal to our in-
digenous stoush-merchants. For on July 24, 1905, Joseph
fought a six-round scrap at the Quaker city, in regard to
which “No Dc.” was inscribed, with champion Jack
Johnson. * * *
Owen Moran, England’s only pugilist of note
to-day, who drew with featherweight champion Abe
Attel'l, at San Francisco (7/9/’08), is going, by the look of
things, to stay in America for a long time to come. It is
the paradise of pugs just now. The London Nationa.
Sporting Club, which discovered Moran, has fallen from
its former more or less high estate in the boxing world.
The majority of the members know little or nothing about
the game. They don’t want scientific exhibitions by
front-rank men so much as wild mix-ups, with the blood,
teeth and hair flying freely. Providers of these latterare
to be had at a very moderate cost in the Cold Country, so
artists of the Moran class are lighting out for foreign
parts where stoush is better comprehended and paid.
The London N.S.C. has been on the down-grade for the
past decade. It is kept going by a few rich enthusiasts,
and when they pass to the land where scrapping is not, the
downfall of the Covent Garden institution is expected, in
knowing circles, to be sudden and complete.
* * * *
The recent disturbance at Vernon (U.S.A.) be-
tween Stanley Ketchell and Billy Papke for the middle-
weight championship of the world, was fairly brief and
cyclonic. Neither had been previously knocked out, so
the interest in the “ fro ” was intense. Ketchell had on a
former occasion got a decision over Papke on
points, and was a hot favorite with the crowd. Pro-
ceedings opened by both stepping into the ring
attired in faded dressing-gowns and bright smiles.
Jiin Jeffries refereed. Ketchell, extending his hand for
the preliminary shake, was refused. Papke there and
then rushed him with great fury. The scrap was practi-
cally ended in under two minutes, though Ketchell, with
remarkable gameness, lasted until the twelfth round.
From the start he was overborne by the tremendous
velocity of Papke’s fighting. In the last three rounds he
was merely a strip of chiffon, staggering round like a
drunk who has lost his support. Papke, on the other
hand, ended up practically undamaged, and almost as
strong as when he started.

Both N.S.W. Rugby bodies, the Union and the
League, are already after the sole use of the Sydney
suburban grounds for the coming season, but the sub-
urban councils are not precipitately rushing to meet
either body. They are sitting hack with an important
expression and dangling the prize before the eyes both
bodies with a view to raising prices. On the other hand,
the NS.W. Cricket Association is after the suburban
councils, and suggests that, as it provides the men who
make money for the councils, the said councils should
share the profits with the Association. Which seems
plausible, but the trouble will be to get the local aider-
men to see it.
“Hiphen” : The more I see of the Australian
game of football, the more I like croquet. I’m a whale
for excitement. American football, where they have an
army of ambulances and trained nurses ready waiting on
the ground, is perhaps somewhat over the odds. But the
Australian game, in my opinion, goes to the other ex-
treme. It’s getting a trifle too tame. There’s too much
free kick and too much umpire’s whistle. In fact, there s
altogether too much umpire. Seems to me that if a
pi aver accidentally pushes an opponent, the umpire plays
airs on his wind instrument and the game is held up while
the pushed one is presented with the ball and invited to
put his boot into it as a salve to his injured feelings. It d
be much more to the point if he were granted a free kick
at the man who pushed him. A certain amount of con-
trol over the game and the players is, of course, neces-
sary, but let us have everything in reason. At present
all a man has to do, apparently, is to fall down and hurst
into tears and the sympathetic umpire awards him a kick
to prevent him weeping any #
Although Clem Hill is not playing in district
cricket in S.A. this year, the selectors have chosen him
and brothers Roy and Solly to practise for the inter-
state contests. Clem is one of the selectors.

Hans Andressen, at the time Quartermaster of the steamer
lia, and well known to many in the coastal trade, wrote on
May, 1903;—“>I have much pleasure in stating that Trench’s
Westra-
the 26th
Remedy
has completely cured me of bpilepsy. 1 suffered severely for eight years, though I had the best
medical advice in various parts of the world. From the time of taking the first dose of Trench’s
Remedy I have been free from every symptom of the complaint, and my general health has greatly
improved.” A recent letter from Mr. Andressen confirms these statements and proves the permanency
of the cure. Send for Valuable Free Booklet.

AT POVERTY POINT.
Melbourne Green Boom Club was an accomplished fact
within three weeks of its projection, and within 10 days
of the job being actually taken in hand. Started in so
practical a manner the mummers’ meeting place is more
than likely to prosper. The premises are the first floor
over a shop in Bourke-street, near Parliament House, and
the staircase leading thereto is sufficiently narrow to
admit of two fat comedians getting wedged in an attempt
to pass one another at full breadth. Upstairs is a big
room, plus sundry dens and ante-rooms—the whole
furnished on a scale of comfortable non-magnificence.
For the present the Club must get along without the
assistance of a liquor license, but, seemingly, the spirit of
good fellowship is available, also orders for soft drinks,
etc., can be executed on the spot. Furthermore the
Club supplies a want. At an informal opening function
last week, old futility actor Tadolphus Bent plaved
heavy lead in a speech that was mercifully brief, after
which William Pitt, M.L.C., made a few remarks, and
chairman Bert Bailey solemnised the occasion with a suit-
able joke. Bailey, in calling for cheers for Bent, asked
that they should be more spontaneous than the shouts qf
the stage villagers who welcome the Young Heir in the
first act of a melodrama. Then he cried “ Hip ! ” and the
company uttered the responses in a loud tone.
“0.K.”: Talking of the forthcoming revival of
“ Society ” by amateurs, somebody asserts that every one
of Tom Robertson’s original comedies was played in Mel-
bourne long ago. The new generation has seen none of
them—on the professional stage, anyhow ; for the revival
of “Caste” and “School” by Brough and Boucicault
dates back 18 years, and no other company has staged any-
thing of Robertson’s in the meantime—excepting, of course,
“ David Garrick,” which he adapted from the French.
Robertson, after battling along as a Bohemian journalist
and actor until he was a worn man of 36, had some five
years of prosperity. But even then he made a lot more
money for the Bancrofts, at their little Prince of Walts’
Theatre, than he made for himself. “Society” was the
comedy that gave them their start, and brought him into
notice. Next year came “Ours,” then “ Caste,” “ Play,”
“ School,” and “ M. P.,” in that order, at intervals of from
nine to fifteen months. “ Caste ” and “ School ” were the
brightest and most durable links in the little chain of suc-
cessful comedies produced by the Bancrofts. “ Home,” a
more melodramaticplay, came on at the Hayinarket, whilst
“School” was running at the Prince of Wales’, and
“ Dreams,” another charming piece in some respects,
was bought for the Gaiety. In both of these, Robertson
wrote a part for his sister Madge, who, by the way, owed
it to her brother that she was able to make her first
appearance in London as Ophelia (to Walter Montgomery’s
Hamlet) when she was only 17. She was only 23 when
Tom died in 1871, and it was as the author’s brilliant
sister that she continued to be spoken of until she finally
changed her stage name to Mrs. Kendal. Alas! Mrs.
Kendal is now a sexagenarian. Tom and Madge Robert-
son are matters of ancient history. Among the audience
at Her Majesty’s (Melbourne), next Friday week (30th),
there will probably be hundreds of people who have seen
Mrs. Kendal act, and not one who associates her name
with that of the man who wrote “ Society.”
A reminder of the original Brough-Boucicault co. turns
up in the programme for the “Society” performance
that Melbourne Savage Club is preparing. E. B. Man-
ning, who is cast for a minor part, was one of the B. and
B. importations—in fact, his was the first name on the
bill of “ Turned Up,” which was the new management’s
first venture in Melbourne. Manning’s wife, profession-
ally known as Miss Florence Harcourt, made her appear-
ance a few weeks later in burlesque (the B. and B. co.
being then a comedy-burlesque combination). Their
Australian daughter, Miss Dorothy Manning, is also
booked for a part in the one-night production of “So-
ciety,” at Her Majesty’s.
“0.K.” : Anderson’s revival of the Drury Lane drama
“Human Nature,” should interest some members of the
original Australian cast, who have been much away from
this country in the meantime, but happen to be in Mel-
bourne just now. The Triumvirate staged “Human
Nature ” at Melbourne Royal in Nov., 1886, “ after months
of preparation,” as the advt. stated. At that time the
Triumvirate had Titheradge and G. W. Anson in its stock
dramatic co., for it was not until the end of ’B7 that they
joined Brough and Boucicault. So Tith and Anson played
in “ Human Nature,” also Herbert Flemming, Phil Beck
Harry Jewett, J. R. Greville, Harry Tavlor, Geo. Brvant
(lately with “ Mrs. Wiggs ”), Bill Leake, and other 'men
who are now dead or otherwise doing well. It is hard to
imagine Titheradge presenting himself on horseback at
the head of a company of gallant supers, but that was one
of his heroic duties in “ Human Nature.” Herbert Flem-
ming’s character was branded with the evil name of
Matthew Hawker, whereas Anson claimed humorous
recognition as Horatio Spofkins. The sentimental
heroine was Miss Maggie Knight—who played so admirably
in “ The Bondman ” last year. Jenny Watt-Tanner had
the part of Cora Grey, which was evidently a wicked one,
every stage Cora, as tradition knows, being'a young woman
with a lurid past and an appalling future. Emma Cham-
bers and Mrs. Wooldridge were in that long cast of
“ Human Nature,” and Nellie Mortyne, who is now play-
ing in “The Morals of Marcus,” under Flemming’s manage-
ment. Some four years later the drama was revived by
the Firm, with an entirely new company, of whom not
one member, as far as the writer knows, is nowadays act-
ing in Australia.
Since the interview in The Lone Hand George Rignold
has, it is said, been deluged with letters from all parts of
the world. Some writers who knew not the place of his
retirement thought of him as dead, and, rejoiced that
he was alive, wrote to tell him so. Others sent him plays
to read ; others again wrote for autographs ; and some
threatened visits. Rignold has bought an extra bull-dog-,
and now, when he returns to his craggy home on the
shores of Middle Harbor, he carefully draws up the ladder
behind him, like Robinson Crusoe, fearing that each bush
may conceal an aspiring author or a perspiring poet
anxious to read his new drama aloud.
“ Haresfoot ” : Very good is that screed about the yore-
tune Englisn tragedians in The Bulletin. I will only
demur to Dillon being classed with the growlers over
their bones. Dillon was an extremely natural actor.
Witness his Belphegor and lago. Garrick, with Nature,
overthrew Quin, the classic, but classicality came again
with Kemble, to be overthrown again by E. Kean.
Macready tried to fuse the two. Brooke, Sullivan,
Anderson, Creswick and excellent Phelps all took more or
less after Macready. C. Kean, with limited physique, was
more of the French romantique. Dillon, Irvine and,
of course, Fechter must all be pronounced very
Frenchy. When Brooke returned to London in 1861 (not
1856, as has been represented) there were four rival
Othellos—Brooke, Phelps, Fechter and C. Kean. All
were bad. Brooke was petered out. His five remaining
years were zig-zaggy. He had flashes in the pan—equal
to himself one night and below Bravo Hicks the next.
Phil Day told me how he acted with Brooke and Irving
tog-ether in Cambridge. The time has come for an im-
partial estimate of Brooke. He was an ignorant genius.
His face was inexpressive. His acting was like a pianola
machine doing music—and such is highly praised by
Melba and Hambourg. Such a magnificent voice, before
he came to Australia, was never heard on the boards.
This, with his matchless, rapidly-changing statuesque
attitudes, reaped the laurel.
September of this year was a month of new plays in
London. No less than four of them by well-known
authors were produced. On September 1, “The Passing
of the Third Floor Back,” Jerome IS. Jerome’s adaptation
of his own book of the same name, was first staged. On
September 3, “ What Every Woman Knows,” by Barrie,
happened. On the sth, a new version of “ Faust,” the
work of Stephen Phillips, was staged by Beerbohm Tree ;
while on the 29th a new version of Caine’s “ Bondman ”
was perpetrated. This new version was called “ Pete.”
“ Harrison Owen ” : Nobody will deny that the part of
Carlotta in “ The Morals of Marcus ” is an extremely diffi-
cult one, and, further, no critical bloke will dispute that
there is room for improvement in the part as played by Miss
Guildford Quin. Miss Quin, unfortunately, both for her
and for us, belongs to the Tilda Brune school of acting,
CIRCUMSTANCES ALTER COSTUMES.
WIFE: “Before we were married you wouldn’t have dared to appear before me in that state."
HUSBAND: “Nor you in that, m’ dear!”
and consequently makes pathos bathetic and naivete dis-
tressing. Actresses of the Matilda Brown school invari-
ably represent the ingenue (the most charming* of sta <r e
females, if properly performed) as a foolish, lisping-, wide-
eyed young person, with about as much brains as the
average grasshopper, and an inane giggle which, in itself
would be sufficient to provoke profanity in an archangel!
Miss Quin is capable of something better than her Car-
lotta ; she might make this young lady a really charming
little piece of goods, if she would only drop the Brune
method. However, when, in the second act, Carlotta
appears in her nocturnal garment, with her abundant
hair falling in picturesque disorder about her shoulders
and the one-eyed cat Polyphemus clutched tightly in her
arms, one feels inclined to forgive her a great deal.
Heaven only knows how the cat feels.
“ O K.Anderson’s latest show, “The Gayest of the
Gay,” is a somewhat ingeniously constructed melodrama.
The first two acts abound in variations and perversions of
“ The Silver King,” some of the hero’s business in the
original drama being given to the heroine in the present
case. The first scene of “Silver King” was the skittle
alley, or garden, of an old-fashioned London suburban
pub. This is changed to the garden of a Thames-side
pub. George Gross is, seemingly, the dissolute gentle-
manly young landlord, and Bert Bailey is a devoted old
Irish waiter, differing from Jaikes (of “Silver King”)
in that he has a taste for liquor. Cross comes
on drunk, cleaned out at the races—like Wilfred Denver.
His loving wife, Eugenie Duggan, adopts the policy of a
Mrs. Denver up-to-date. She upbraids hubby for his un-
soberness and curses him for having* “done in” the rent
at the races. After which he kills, or stuns, a bookmaker,
and flees to a foreign land, whereupon Laurence Dunbar
who is the “Spider ” of this stolen web, inflames the lady’s
jealousy, and prompts her to a Gay life. So, in the second
act, Mrs. Denver Duggan appears as the giddy occupant
of a Piccadilly flat instead of a starving respectable
matron in a snow-topped hovel. And the faithful Jaikes
Bailey is her waiter, who gets happy on unlimited
champagne. A millionaire from abroad is talked of as a
likely visitor at the sinful flat. He appears in the next
scene as the Silver King husband, clean shaven and
immensely rich, seeking penitently the poor, dear wife
who bullied him of yore. She, meanwhile, has decided
to turn good and go hospital nursing with her twin
sister. Spider Dunbar lures her to her returned husband’s
room at a hotel with the idea of killing her, but before
she can get there the twin sister arrives, so the Spider
murders her by mistake. Mrs. Denver Duggan finds
ln the roonl except the corpse, and then, like
Wilfred Denver, she declares that her old gay self is
deceased and to-morrow she will begin a new life—in the
character of her defunct relative. The authors of this
amazing composition filched their principal characters
and situations from “The Silver King,” and, having
adapted the heroine and old Jaikes to the requirements
of an altered plot, gave the lady a lump of the “fat ” that
belonged to her husband in the original drama. He
returns from abroad as a millionaire, without having been
able to lose his old identity. The familiar text of the
burg led story is : •
“ l hold it true, with him who sings
To one clear harp in divers tones,
That men may rise on stepping stones
Of their dead selves to higher things.”
Here it is the woman who uses her dead self for upward
stepping purposes, and, as a fall was essential to her sub-
sequent rise, the authors let her fall on the slightest
provocation.
“The Swimmer”: Heard Bill Squires, of Australia,
deliver his “ lecture ” in front of the Burns-Squires film
at the Auckland Opera House last night. Bill is no Dan
O’Connor. In fact, he can barely be described as a
Demosthenes. He has not the gift of ready speech. Also he
is shy, shrinking, nervous—all the things that one is not
wont to look for in a pug. He was badly stage-managed.
His impresario sent him on in evening dress, and William
does not look well in evening dress. He was suffering
from stage fright as he faced a packed and yelling house,
and his brief speeeh of introduction was audible only a
few seats away. It was understood to be an intimation
that William intended being a fly in the Burns-Johnson
ointment later on; Then the films started to unwind,
and William gazed at them apparently wrapt in contem-
plation. Towards the end of she first round he remarked
meditatively: “Very quick on his feet, is Burns.” After
another round or so had fled away in silence, William
roused himself to whisper to the wings, “ Burns
missed me with a hard right.” After this William
rested on his oars till a couple more rounds
had been reeled off, when he confidentially informed a
friend in the orchestra that “ the referee is having hard
work to separate us.” In the seventh round a hard
smack from William just missed getting home. The re-
sulting applause so encouraged William that he rose to
his greatest effort. “ Yes, it was a hard blow,” he re-
marked ; “it wouldn’t have done him any good if it had
landed.” Then he lapsed into silence again till the last
sad round, when he briefly remarked, “ This is where you
see me knocked out,” and directly he was knocked out
he fled into the friendly darkness of the wings. But if
Squires failed to impress the Auckland people as a lec-
turer, he impressed them most favorably with his
modesty, and both papers referred to his possession of
this rare pugilistic quality next day. Truly, William is a
lamb—out of the ring.
Musgrove seems to have had enough of foreign opera
companies ; and no wonder. Nearly every German or
Italian company which has been brought to Australia in
the last few years has given exhibitions of the quarrel-
some artistic temperament. Ap irtfrom Musgrove’s rowdy
and throaty Germans, the last Italian opera company
brought to Australia by Williamson was a seething mass
of revolt throughout its whole career. Hazon had brought
the people from Italy and was conductor ; but they
nearly drove him mad. He got into a frame of mind in
which he extolled Frederick the Great for sending-recal-
citrant singers to prison, and Louis XV. for his lettr6-de-
cacliet which consigned Sophie Arnould to gaol for tem-
peramental tantrums. Seeing him looking very ill, a
friend remarked that he had better take a holiday, “or
you’ll soon be conducting the celestial choir.” “ Not if
there are any Italians in it!” Hazon replied emphatic-
ally.
A benefit will be given at the Royal Standard Theatre
Sydney, on Nov. 5, to one of the oldest of the old-time
Thespians, Miss Clara Stephenson, who, 40 years ago, was
in the upper flights of the profession as a supporter of
Walter Montgomery and others, in the star system of
those days. Miss Stephenson retired from the - stage on
her marriage, but the deatli of her husband brought her
back, at times, to the scenes of her early successes. It is
a pity that some larger and more promising opening than
the old Royal Standard can’t be found for such an occa-
sion as this. ■*.
“Stargazer”: “The Morals of Marcus,” built on the
excellent Ibsen plan, could all be packed into its own last
act, without cramming and with small alteration. In
point of fact practically the Whole of the play is already
there, and a stranger, dropping in late for the final
flutter, would know as much as any 7 devoted soul who
had sat out the three preliminaries. The last act not
only 7 contains all the story, but it displays all the emotions,
and is really a good condensed drama' in itself, whereas
the whole of “ The Morals” is somewhat tedious. As a
rule it is the last act that lingers superfluous on the stage,
and in this particular at least W. J. Locke’s play has a
fair claim to originality 7.
“ Floater ” : Someone asks, “ What is the secret of the
apparently 7 irresistible fascination which J. Knight exerts
over the sex which buttons its clothes at the back?”
There isn’t any. Of course, Knight used to be repre-
sented as a charmer of some million candle power, but at
their best the representations were onlv general allega-
tions. And being sceptical by nature, I don’t believe
allegations. Many of the small brigade of girls who pro-
fess to idolise-Knight would be equally gushing about
Premier I leak in if Alfred were to cast soulful glances
at them.
“ : Rushed in with the late door patronisers to see
the arms and legs of the “ Red Mill.” The antics of the
Mill chorus tempt me to g - o crook. They 7 came on in-
discriminately at every 7 musical number and made guys
of themselves. They wagged their heads to the refrains,
flipped their hands in imitation of sick angels killing
annoying flies, salaamed, raised and lowered brooms,
flowers or any other old thing accommodatingly hand v.
If they had lifted up butchers’, blocks, 2cwt. dumbbells,
dog kennels, or small cannon, I would willingly have
offered a cheer. But they'didn’t. Instead, they just
kept waving the same light kitchen furniture and light,
vegetables all the evening, . J left early, as 1 can get my
landlady to brandish brooms at me by 7 simply withholdin< >7
my board money for a week.
Discussion of the deviation of the Lithgow
Zigzag, on the Great Western (N.S.W.) railway
line, has brought out neatly one difference between
constructing public works on borrowed money and
out of revenue. Traffic Manager Harper and
Engineer-in-Chief Fraser favor a grade of one in
50, with the use of a push-up engine; but Chief
Commissioner Johnson favors a grade of one in 90.
the latter is admitted to be the more desirable,
but it will be more expensive. Messrs. Harper
and Fraser are agreeable to accept it if the extra
expense be met out of revenue and not from loan.
The newlv-iniported Johnson’s plan would mean
a bigger lOU for the next generation to meet;
but in Johnson’s own day the working costs would
be less, and Johnson’s reputation as a railway
manager would thus get a shove along.
As the result of closer settlement, revalua-
tions have been pressed upon one or two Victorian
shires, and the results show the urgent need for
the Bill which Bent, the other day, threw under
the table. Huntlv, to the north of Bendigo, is a
case in point. For years past the small cockies
and village settlers have had to pay nearly twice
as much per acre in municipal rates as the squat-
ters. If the cockie’s improved land was valued
at £5 an acre, the squatter’s unimproved land
across the road or over the fence would only be
valued at from £2 to £3 per acre, and the only
reason in general was that the squatter was a
loafer, and had not improved his land to any
extent, and didn’t make the best use of it. Lately
the councillors ordered a fresh valuation, and
when the valuer valued the land without con-
sidering whether it was cockie’s territory or
squatter’s, the big men yelled in chorus that it
was daylight robbery, that they would appeal,
and a lot of other things. Still there is probably
not one landowner who would sell his land at the
value placed on it by the shire official, and if any-
body went and offered that price he would stand
a good chance of having the dogs sooled on to him.
It is quite a while since the Argus printed
anything so mournful as a recent letter, implor-
ing the Federal Tory party to organise. One can
almost see the tears :
At the present moment there is no common policy, no
party or platform which such can rally under—we are
simply a disorganised mass.
And hear the sob
Who are we? What are we? Without a name we are
nothing and helpless.
Then comes the appeal:—
A name will make or mar a book, and so a noble and bold
name will in itself arouse enthusiasm and pride.
But, alas ! they have tried that caper before.
They have branded the poor old beast “Free-
trade,” and “The Constitutional Party,” and
“The National Australian Association,” and
“ Anti-Sosh,” and the brand makes no sort of
difference—the poor old animal keeps on remain-
ing dead. It isn’t a new brand the Tory party
wants j it is a new policy.
AT THE GREENROOM CLUB.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Thomas Bent to-day performed the opening- cere-
mony of the Green Room Club, making a characteristically
humorous speech. He declared the club open with ail
the more pleasu're, as he knew that many an actor would
meet his fellow-actor there and talk of actors who had
come and gone, and be the better for doing- it. —News

Order a glass of wliis-
Ky from the waiter, and perpend :

Of bygone mummers let me tell,
And all they did for Art ;
And of the way they cast a spell
Upon the public heart.
Take Hamlet! Ah ! the golden night
I played the Dreary Dane :
My boy, I shed a gleaming light
Upon that rdle. The pain
My reading gave to rival mimes
Was made full clear to me ;
They squared the press. Next day the Times
Termed me “ an infamy.”
“ The Silver King ” ? In ’95
I took him “ on the road.”
The way I acted used to drive
Critics to drink, and goad
The populace to such a state
Of frenzied interest
That, at the instance of a mate,
I gave this drama best.
In comic parts it was the same,
When first I hurled the gaunt-
Let on the stage in Humor’s name,
And showed as “Charley’s Aunt.”
The house rose up from gallery
To stalls and screamed aloud,
Zounds ! how their howls encouraged me,
I felt I’d gripped my crowd.
Next day I got the sack. The dogs
Who spurned my art and me
Suffered from that which judgment clogs—
Base, grinding jealousy.
My Romeo—What! got a train
To catch ; that is a bore.
Next time you’re here we’ll chat again
Of mimes I’ve known of yore.

THE NEED OF EXAMPLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A deputation of clergymen and others which waited on
N.S. W. Premier Wade asked that no places of amusement
should, either directly or indirectly, be allowed to charge
for admission on the Sabbath ; that shops retailing light
refreshments should be shut ; and that the Government
should remove all temptations to spend money on Sun-
day on any kind of pleasure.— News Item.
What we need is an example; that is reallv what we
need !
Then we’d see how very sinful ’twas to have a Sundav
feed !
We would recognise that lollies are a menace to the soul
Of the poor misguided infant who obtains a Sabbath
dole !
As for Sunday entertainments, we should cordially agree
With the clergy, that admission should be absolutely
free !
Let performers play for nothing, and no entrance fee be
charged,
And the scope of Sunday concerts would be very much
enlarged !
It is wrong to go to Manly, and a bad example, too;
It is wrong to go to Coogee or to look in at the Zoo !
It is wrong to part with money on the Sabbath Day at all
If we part with it for pleasure—be the pleasure great or
small !
Papers published on the Sabbath should, of course, be
issued free !
That to buy a peach on Sunday is a crime, we all agree !
Were we all right-thinking people it is very clear to me
We would milk no cows on Sunday—’tis a thing which
should not be !
Then the Government should, surely, cease to charge for
Sunday trams !
And well might friend Samuel Mauger grant free Sunday
telegrams !
There are other things, I’m certain, I could mention bj'
the score—
What we want is an example, as I think I said before !
So I rise to ask the clergy to assist us on the way
To a meet and due observance of the Sabbath ; and would
say,
As we long for an example, do not leave us in the lurch—
Lead the way by stopping Sabbath Day collections in the
Church !

that the lotion was doing no good. He
gave me a different lotion and an oint-
ment, but still insisted on saying not to
bathe the baby. I used the remedies
but he got no better. There was no
rest, no sleep for baby or myself and I
was worn out. Baby was very thin

Victoria : s Insolvency Judge Moule, who seems
to lack a proper regard for the customs of the profession,
had a notable bout with Costs, the other day, and
knocked the beast out in one round. The matter con-
cerned an insolvency, in connection with which a solicitor
had unloaded a bill of Costs of which the trustee refused
to take delivery. The items that caused the uproar were,
“ Drawing assignment, folios 73, at 25., £7 65.,” and “ en-
grossing same with schedules, 76 folios, copy to file, 76
folios, £1 18s.” It didn’t look much to make a song
about, but it appeared that all Gent. One did was to buy
a printed document and fill in 12 words—insolvent’s name
and address and occupation, and the date. For a similar
document he charged 19s. as for “ engrossing,” and for
another a second 19s. as for a fair copy—£9 4s.
for about live minutes’ simple work. Judge Moule
couldn’t stand it. He wasn’t exactly shocked, being a
lawyer himself, but he was a trifle sarcastic. “He did
not desire to say one word in derogation of the right
which legal men had to be properly paid for their deep
research [in the art of how to fill in a name and address]
and for the result of many years of training [in how to
put down the date correctly], and he intended no reflec-
tion on the conveyancing practitioners of Victoria, but
bethought the scale should be amended. The docu-
ments were facsimiles of each other—on which, then, was
the special skill expended entitling the solicitor to charge
2s. per folio ? ” Then he disallowed the larger item and
suggested that the chief clerk should do the same with
the others, except for the actual writing contained in the
deed. It was a grievous blow to Costs, but it wasn’t half
as sudden as it ought to have been.
* * * *
Westralia has been learning something about
an “ honorable understanding,” too—much the same
sort of “horrible understanding” that John Darling
and the other S. Australian wheat-buyers lately confessed
to. Only, in the Westralian case, it isn’t the producer
that has cause to squeal ; it is the consumer. The matter
sprang out of the inquiry which a Commission is making
with a view to finding out why meat, is so dear in a coun-
try where the bullock and cheap grazing country are both
so numerous. Isidor Samuel Emanuel has so far been
the chief witness—the elder of the Emanuel Bros., who
have the longest finger in the Westralian meat-
trade : the finger, in fact, on which the Westralian
meat ring is reputed to hang. “ But a ring ! ” savs
Emanuel—“Oh no ! Not that ! ” “There is certainly an
understanding', ’ he told the Commission—“an under-
standing that we will only sell meat at certain prices. ...
And we would certainly not supply any man whom we
knew to be selling at lower than the scale of rates which
we understand the retailers have agreed upon.” The
poor fellow might ruin himself, Isidor Emanuel explained.
Also (but he didn’t mention that) it might compel other
retailers to reduce their prices ; and if the retailers had
to reduce their prices, where would the wholesaler’s fat
profits be? Still, Isidor Emanuel was strongly in favor of
Private Enterprise—provided always, apparently, that
Isidor Emanuel had the regulating of it. In fact, he is a
whale for Private Enterprise, so long as it’s his own
enterprise, or moves the way he wants it to.
“S. Remo”: Give “Wealthy Willie” (B.
17/9/’08) my compliments and tell hitii he’s been badlv
rooked. The—ah—extwemely stylish hat he purchased
with much secrecy from his tailor is being manufactured
in—Australia. I can send him a dozen if he likes the
style. The—alt—object of all the—ah—exclusiveness,
which “ Wealthy Willie ”. encountered, is to prevent the’
Australian manufacturer producing the same shape, etc.
in hats. Also it’s a cute move to make the purchaser
imagine his hat is the only pebble on the beach—or the
only lid on the skull. However, as the Australian hat-
maker mostly rises before 10 a.m., he doesn’t get left anv
further behind than suits him. Most Australian makers
are kept in touch, by their agents, with the fashions of
the world. But it is easily possible for a man in the hat
trade in Australia to be too much up-to-date. A fashion
has to be pretty well established in London before it
catches on in Australia ; and if it doesn’t catch on the
hatter has the stock left on his hands. But the time isn’t
fir distant when, even in the matter of fashions, Austra-
lia, like the United States, will have some of its own.
* IT
“Itan”: The trade in live Chows is declared
by a Customs officer to be one of the most profitable
branches of business, robbery, etc., these times. There is
no secret about the market price of the goods either—
£loo per head; and it is said that the cost of delivering
the fish does not, as an average, eat up more than £S(X
There is much greater risk in smuggling opium ashore"
as it has to b - carried, while the Chow simply walks off
in his ship’s clothes and joins forces with his jabbering
countrymen at the f in-tan dens, or the vegetable gardens
or the furniture shops, and there wades in to work’
It would be rash and wrong to say that the majority of
Customs officers only have one eye, but it is pretty safe to
declare that quite a few seem to suffer from a form of
color blindness. There is not much encouragement to let
the opium get ashore, because it is dangerous truck, but
the live Chow is quite able to use a whole car°’o of
cunning in helping to escape detection.

In the old days, Cockatoo Island was the ex-
tensive rock in Sydney Harbor on which “the System ”
used to put its worst characters, trusting to the sharks
thereabout to supply all the patrol that was needed.
Nowadays, though there is still a homely sort of old gaol
there for short-timers who want a change of air, Cockatoo
Island is used for very different things. The Government
dock, warships go when they need keel-
hauling, most people know; but there’s an interesting
workshop there of another kind. For years and years
when the Education Department wanted school furni-
ture, it used to call for tenders, and have the
blackboard and the map-stick made by contract
and charged up along with the other permanent
and reproductive undertakings. Then someone remem-
bered the two or three hundred youngsters whom the
State was struggling to reform on the Sobraon ; and as
it s a hard job to grow wheat on Sydney Harbor and the
wool clip on Iron Cove never amounts' to much, it was
decided to make some of these youngsters buck in at car
pentering In the past year they turned out £BI6S worth of
the school furniture that used to be made elsewhere and
after paying the instructors’ salaries and a trifle of wa«-e8
for t TL^ ys themselves, the business showed a profitTof
over £2B°o- n ot to mention the bigger profit represented
b) the trade that the youngsters are being drilled into.

Tiie kitchen cupboard’s empty, the rent is overdue,
The missus feels it badly, the kids is cryin’ too,

But thiS is still my comfort—the tariff bogey’s laid,
An’ livin’s cheap in England because we ’ave Freetrade.
My Sunday togs are ’angin’ in uncle’s shop this day,
The kids is all in tatters, my clo’es are all decay.
Yet moochin’ slow an’ ’ungry along the streets I go,
An’ ain’t I proud an’ ’appy to see the drapers’ show !
Lord, but they’re cheap, them garments, an’ mostly
foreign made,
“Thank God,” says I, “ in England we ’aven’t lost Free-

I’m sorry for them people in lands beyond the sea
Wot ’aven’t got enlightened the same as you an’ me.
They’re workin’, yus, they’re workin’, an’ earnin’ money

But, Lord, the price of livin’ 1 It knocks me ’ow they do.
Their hours is pretty easy, but, blow me, when they’re

Look wot it costs to keep them in lands without Free-

The mills is lyin’ idle, the farms is runnin’ out,
An’ no mistake there’s ’unger an’ idle men about,
But don’t be mean an’ narrer, look fairly round the case,

RUGS cure acute diseases because the latter are of poisonous origin,
‘ Ynd the Sn in drugs counteracts or neutralizes the poison
in the body. They fail to cure chrome diseases
n „ make strength, as you who have tried them know. Chronic
ailments are caused by depletion of the nerve tissues, lack of recreation,
of fresh air and of exercise, the non-assimilation of food, and often by
excesses in eating, drinking and numerous other excesses and violations
of the laws of Nature which result in weakness of the various organs
It goes without saying that the taking of poison into the body will not, cannot
cure the e conditions, for poisons do not give nourishment
What must be the means of cure ? It certainly must be something which
i nJld reinstates the lost or wasted vitality. It must be a natural element of

HOW TO EXPAND THE SPAN OF LIFE!
AVOID CONSTIPATION.
DY neglectin'* irregularity of the bowels the victim is inflicting on himself or herself untold
D ao-onv for the future. Permanent relief from this baneful disorder is easily obtained
by usinor Kutnow’s Powder. And why ? Because Kutnow’s Powder is Nature’s own
remedyr in which are incorporated certain health-giving properties of the most famous
European spas. It acts gently, speedily and efficiently. Try it at once.
Mrs. L. MARTIN writes:
“ Cornfield, Lavagh, Ballymote, Co. Sligo,
“ 30th March, 1908.
tt Gentlemen, —I got a bottle of Kutnow’s Powder lately for a boy
of ten, who suffered from biliousness. He is wonderfully improved since
taking your Powder ; his health is now quite good. You may make what
use you like of my letter, as it may be the means of curing others.
“ Faithfully yours,
“ Mrs. B. MARTIN.”
How to Guard Against Fraud!
There is only one genuine Kutnow’s Powder. All conscientious
Chemists supply it throughout the World. Be careful to avoid spurious
substitutes which often cause irreparable injury to health. See that the
fac-simile signature, “S. KutnOW & Co., Ld.,” and the registered
trade mark, “ HirSChensprung or Doer Leap/’ are on the carton and
bottle. You now know
How to Get Genuine Kutncw’s Powder.
THE ONLY WAY
When you have obtained a bottle of Kutnow’s Powder, take a
dessertspoonful next morning before breakfast. Put the Powder m a
tumbler of water, which may be cold, tepid, or hot, allow it to effervesce,
and drink slowly. About 10 to 15 minutes later take a hot cup of tea to
hasten its action. After Kutnow’s Powder has acted, note the immediate
beneficial effect. You will find that you feel ever so much better, ready
for hard work, brighter and clearer in mind. It will make you eat well,
work well, and sleep well.
W. ROUGH AN, Esq., writes:
“ 106 High Street, Southampton,
“ 28th April, 1908.
“ Dear Sirs, —I beg to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of a
bottle of your celebrated Kutnow’s Powder. I may say, even by so small
a quantity, I have derived much benefit therefrom, thus testifying to its
excellent qualities.
“Yours faithfully,
“ W. ROUGH AN.”

When the Commonwealth Parliament can
spare an hour from the interminable “questions
without notice” it might do worse than run
through a short measure to deal with the sort of
case that Canada met by this brief clause in its
criminal code:—
Spreading False News Damaging to a Public In-
terest.—Everyone is guilty of an indictable offence and
liable to one year’s imprisonment who wilfully and know-
ingly publishes any false news or tale whereby injury or
mischief is likely to be occasioned to any public interest.
Moreover, that clause isn t a dead letter ; it isn t
so long since an Ontario citizen got three months
for lying about the country he makes a out
of. And the title of the measure might be, “An
Act relating to the Disposal of Stinking Fish.”
“ 10-2-4 ” writes :
Oxford University has just established a course in
Agricultural Education. Says a N.S.W. paper, which
deals with the mysteries of stock-raising, the amount of
soluble phosphate of lime to put into fertilisers, and so
forth “ With Oxford placing the study of agriculture
on a par with all its other courses of instruction, and
representatives of the nobility and gentry of Great Bntain
matriculating as agricultural students, it is quite proba-
ble that a more honorable state of mind may obtain in
this country, and the degree of Bachelor of Agriculture
be accorded as much respect as Bachelor of Arts, or Law,
or Philosophy.” ,
As ; a matter of fact, the change indicated is not so mucn
a probability as a certainty. The scholar—the type who
quotes Horace, Grotius, Aristophanes, and such-Uke
puzzling people—is “bad form” in modern ‘ good
society.” He is a nuisance. Also he is half-a-century
behind the times. Schoolmasters and clerics are suffered
to know something about the classics, but even they are
impelled to keep rather dark concerning their shameful
information. The legislator who discharges a slab of
Ovid in the House of Commons is yawned at; the out-
door speaker who. allows himself a Latin or Greek tag
stands a fair chance of being egged. This admirable state
of things is due to the broadcast spread of the cheap
“ Dictionary of Classical Quotations,” and the resulting
upspringing of a host of Dan O’Connors wherever the
Union Jack waves. .
A knowledge of agricultural affairs is a different cir-
cumstance altogether. Your “smart” Britisher who
isn’t able to talk knowingly about wind-galls, glanders,
spavins, and the best way to deal with “roarers,’ is
right out of the conversation in the salons of London and
Paris or in the shires. Also well-to-do Britons male and
female-are expected to know a certain amount about
such things as fluke in sheep, swine fever, foot-rot and
the mange as it affects various breeds of dogs. Those who
don’t are voted dull, ill-educated, illiterate. They are in
the same position as the lumpish squireen of a century
ago who looked foolish when addressed in what passed in
his county for the Latin tongue. Undoubtedly an agri-
cultural course will boom at Oxford. It will lead the
wealthy young* man with social aspirations along*, at any
rate, one avenue of learning* that will be of use to him in
after life.

KNOWLEDGE IS POWER.
Thirty years of assiduous study of The Hair and its Treatment, and all

CONVINCING TESTIMONY.
Gentleman writes from
St. Peters, S.A. : “I enclose
P.N. for ns. 6d. for two
months’ treatment of your
Plair Restorer. This has been
brought under my notice by an
utter stranger, who, seeing the
bad state'of my hair, sympa-
thised with me and told me he
had been cured by your pre-
parations. ”
Here is a case of Scalp
Trouble :
Mr. Coolstad writes
from W.A., stating that the
PARASENE and Exemo sup-
plied to him has removed the
irritation of the scalp, and is
producing a splendid growth
of strong, thick, healthy hair
on his bald head.
Mr.' Rodgers, W.A.,
writes : After using your pre-
parations for a few months,
my hair is showing every sign
of being as good as ever it was.
One of the Melbourne
Doctors says : “If anything
will make the hair grow, these
preparations will.”
Another Doctor says:
“Mr. Holland has treated
my wife and daughter s hair
most successfully. I can re-
commend his preparations
with confidence, knowing
them to be of the most genuine
character.”

The funniest debate at the recent Sydney
women’s confabulation was that on Socialism.
One furious dame brought down the Conference
with this—a good sample of the discussion :
The other side should state clearly and definitely what
its brand of Socialism is. If it wants free love and the
State ownership of children, the sooner we know about
it the better, and then we can fight it to the "bitter end.
(Loud cheers.) i
On the other side, if Anti-Sosh is contemplating
any scheme of working the laboring classes in
chains on the public roads, or is thinking of intro-
ducing bigamy or polygamy or any such like idea,
it is plainly Anti-Sosh’s duty to state the fact
immediately. Let us have a definition of Anti-
Sosh, especially in its relation to-the State owner-
ship of railways, tramways, posts, telegraphs,
telephones and such like.
“ 5.5.,” from Melbourne :
I came a good deal into contact with the younger
officers of the United States Fleet during their stay in Mel-
bourne. The quality in them that struck me most was
their indifference to England and all things English.
“ We’ve got no use for England, you knbw.” If I heard
that phrase once, I heard it 50 times, and everywhere I
am told of the sailors voicing the same sentiment. The
Yanks liked Australians very well, but the moment a
British tap was turned on a sort of pained apathy' seized
upon them, and in their tired way they let it lie seen that
the nice things Sperry and the other elderly diplomats
were saying about J. Bull were all guff. Of no other
white nation did the officer boys speak contemptuously'.
“If the Jap happens to be our enemy in the Pacific,
England’s the Monkey’s ally'in the Atlantic,” they said,
with quiet conviction. A Vic. M.P., who threw the
dregs of liis cup of tea over the rail of the Virginia,
was told by an officer! “I hope :nut’s symbolical.
Someone ought to spill a power of tc; in waters one
of these days.” In spite of the whoo. ■ about the Anglo-
Saxon race, and the “common spec., i.” and toe red
ribbon of kinship, the Fleet visit has made ,t thoroughly'
understood here that in becoming the ally of the swarm-
ing Asiatic England has forfeited all tins respect it had
won from the U.S. people in 20 years.
When Queensland Premier Kidston was
in the Huge Fog lie dragged a dubious barracouta
across the surface of events in an interview with
the Mokning Post
The people who advocate the centralisation movement
in Australia are people who want to make Australia a
republic and cut the painter with this country (England).
Then he waved his dreadful fish some more :
You know, those of you who are familiar with Federal
affairs, that the Socialistic party, although not in a
majority', have managed, as a result of difficulties between
the other parties over the Customs tariff, .to control the
Commonwealth Parliament. And they’ hope to do more.
Why’, it has been said openly that they intend to make
the States impose a land-tax by 7 depriving' them of the
Customs revenue. I think the majority of the Australians
concerned will fight them very earnestly and bitterly in
the near future.
Evidently the Kidston who was and the Kidston
who is are utter strangers. And no wonder!
The one who was wouldn’t be seen dead with the
one who is !

BRONCHITIS
CURE
The Famous Remedy for
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, <§s CONSUMPTION,
Has the Largest Sale of any Chest Medicine in the World.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Its healing power is marvellous. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of
Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it
effects a Complete Cure. It is most comforting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become
chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has never been known to exist where “ Coughs” have been properly treated with tbis medicine. No house
should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient, and a Complete Cure is certain.
Beware of Imitations ! The great success of KEARNEY BRONCHITIS CURE, has induced a number
of unprincipled persons to make imitations, each calling his medicine “Bronchitis Cure,” with the object of
deceiving the simple-minded, and so getting a sale for an imitation which has none of the beneficial effects that
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE has. Consequently it has become necessary to draw your attention to this fact,
and to request you in your own interests to be particular to ask for HEARNE’S and to see that you get it.
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE, Small Size, 2/6; Large Size, 4/6. Sold by Chemists and Medicine Vendors, and by the
Proprietor, W. G. HEARNE, Chemist, Geelong, Victoria. Forwarded to any Address, when not obtainable locally.
NOTlCE.—Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure No. lAdoes NOT contain any poison within the meaning of the Act. It is equally beneficial for the youngest
child and the most aged person.
BENGER’S FOOD is quite
distinct from any other. It
possesses the remarkable property
of rendering milk with which it
is mixed when used, quite easy of
digestion by Infants and Invalids.

IBS
One of the most valuable foods
known to science. It gives the
body abundance of nourishment,
with complete or partial rest to
the digestive system, regulated
as may be advisable.
Benger's Food is sold in tins by Chemists, etc., everywhere .
The ‘ ‘ shire ” councillor seems to be the same
everywhere. He doesn’t receive quite as much
attention in S. A us. as, in most places; yet when
he was up for discussion in the Assembly there
the other .night, he was represented as the same
014 shirk. “Everyone in these country districts,”
said Donald Campbell, “knows everyone else ;
and you could no more confer upon them the re-
sponsibility of carrying out sanitary legislation
than you could entrust them with the control of
the police.” They would,simply dodge any duty
likely to cause any of their friends unpleasantness.
" You can 4 bluff ? them into action if you pass a
law on the subject;’’,, optimistically suggested
Labor-member Anstey ; to which Treasurer Peake
(who was for years clerk of a district council)
replied with emphasis, “Don’t make any mistake,
you can’t ! ”
WHICH?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a happy little valley ’twixt the mountains and
the sea,
If the clever Japs had taken Australasia,
That is good enough to shelter pretty Susan Jane and
me,
When the cunning Japs have taken Australasia.
There the spuds will greenly grow, .
And the winds will softly blow,
And the cows will gently low,
And the seasons come and go,
Though we never face the foe,
And the sudden Japs have taken Australasia.
There’S a set of decent fellows that might learn to shoot
and drill
E’er the Wily Japs set sail for Australasia ;
There’s a fort that might be planted on a most convenient
* hill
E’er the fighting Japs set foot in Australasia.
If we only could agree
That we wanted to be free,
In a year or two there’d bo
Armored ships upon the sea
That were manned by you and me,
And the Monkey wouldn’t fancy Australasia.

WHAT TIME IS IT BY
YOUR STOMACH?
IF YOUR STOMACH DOES NOT STRIKE
“MEAL TIME” THREE TIMES A DAY,
IT USUALLY MEANS DYSPEPSIA.
HOW TO BE HAPPY-HUNGRY.
As a rule all hours of the day look alike, and
feel alike, to the dyspeptic. There is no hanker-
ing for breakfast, no gnawing for lunch, and no
mouth-watering for dinner. Disgust takes the
place of desire, and the clock itself at meal-time
reflects the owner’s grumpy face.
If before breakfast, before dinner, and before
supper you do not feel a happy-hungry feeling
and longing for food, and feel that you could eat
almost anything put before you, you have a
symptom of dyspepsia.
If during your meals you still have an aversion to
food, or feel hungry and not hungry at the same
time, you have a very pronounced case of dyspepsia.
If after your meals you feel bloated, or gassy, or
you have heartburn and pains in your stomach, or
you feel gurgly brash rising in your throat, you
have a chronic case of dyspepsia, and you have
had it a long time, probably without realising it.
For all these things there is a sure cure, a cure
that will make mealtime an awaited pleasure, and
the meal itself a soothing luxury. This is true—
because the cure, DR. SHELDON’S DIGES-
TIVE TABULES, contain just the elements
which a good, strong, healthy stomach has.
Each little Tabule is enough to digest 3000
grains of food, thoroughly and well—just as
though you had no stomach at all.
DR. SHELDON’S DIGESTIVE TABULES
actually do ail the work of a healthy stomach.
They digest if your stomach can’t. They digest
everything.
Take one or two after each meal and know what
it is to have the luxury of a perfect digestion, and
stop irritation, belching, bloat and brash, and
that “lump of lead” feeling. They cure dys-
pepsia, indigestion, and all stomach troubles.
They contain absolutely nothing harmful.
Try them to-day, and let your stomach be con-
vinced, let your mind be at ease, and your face

By Royal Warrant to
G
His Majesty the King,
Where the Saltbush Grows.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I AM sitting in a garden, by a harbor prospect
fair,
And a green world glows around me into
distance ev’rywhere ;
And the petals fall in showers
Like a snowstorm of dead flowers.
Where a young Spring trips the orchards with the
south wind in her hair.
Here glad buttercups unfold their burnished cups
of floral gold ;
To the nectars of the morning, and the pine trees,
tall and old,
Lift their heads to greet September—
Like knights errant, who remember
Courts and tournaments of Nature, in the ancient
years untold.
Now the florists’ windows gleaming are bedecked
with spoil of Spring,
Now the maiden waiteth blushing for a lover—and
a ring.
Now the matron, laughing gaily,
Treads her path of pleasure daily,
While our city sparrows twitter, and our caged
canaries sing.
But a rude, uncultured longing through my in-
ward fancy flows;
I am restless and uneasy ; far too well my spirit
knows
That the wizard West is calling,
With a siren voice enthralling,
From her free, unpastured places, where the
stunted saltbush grows !
From her plains, outspreading lonely under cloud-
less skies away,
Comes a summons to my garden by the hill-sur-
rounded bay :
“Come, oh come again, my rover ;
Come, oh come again, my lover ;
Come out and see the glory and the grandeur of
the day.”
“ Will your city give nepenthe ? ” cries the spirit
of the West—
“ Will its markets fill the chalice of the longings
in your breast ?
Is the traffic in its thunder
Like that still and quiet wonder
Of the moon above the mulga where the weary
riders rest?”
Then my garden in the suburbs grows as narrow
as a tomb,
Then the woof and warp of Commerce on its ever-
whirling loom,
Like a web of evil fairies,
Like a garment of despair is,
Like a cerement swiftly woven by the cogs and
wheels of Doom.
We can never rest in cities, as our wise Bush
Mother knows ;
Let the merchant to his markets where the golden
.current flows ;
But the bushman’s feet must wander
In the open over yonder,
Where old myall droops his branches and the
silver saltbush grows. .
Not in crowded squares or highways; not in
terraces in rows,
Not in tiled suburban cages shall our life days
surely close,
When the old Bush voices woo us,
When the West-land whispers to us,
From her free and trackless places where the
silver saltbush grows.

THE PASSENGER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
XT was Jones’ third attempt to get away
on his annual leave, now some months
overdue. He had been brought back to the
Traffic Office by urgent wires just as he was
getting on board the train on both previous occa-
sions. This time he had taken the precaution to
leave no address behind him, and had got on a
mixed train at Bay of Dogs with a view to board-
ing the northern express some 20 miles out.
He carried his luggage unobtrusively on to the
platform and hailed Billy, the cadet.
“ Billy, I don’t want anybody to see me. Just
sling my traps into the .van of No. 4, and I’ll get
on from the other side. Here’s half-a-crown for
you.”
Billy smiled, and after pocketing the coin re-
marked drily:
“Kelly's got a telegraphic circular to the
suburban section to instruct you to return to the
Traffic Office on urgent business. Shall I get it
for you ? ”
Jones swore fluently, and produced another
half-crown from the depths of his trousers.
“No fear ! They’ve got to catch me first. I’ll lie
low till we’re past Upper Port Cargill. Now you
be sure and sling my traps in when Gow’s in the
office getting his waybills.”
Then Jones disappeared. Billy carted the
luggage a little further down the platform, and
mentally decided that he had better not risk
getting labels.
When No. 4 arrived Kelly walked down the
platform to meet the guard and inquire if anyone
had been run in for embezzlement. As he did so
his eye fell on the pile of Jones’ luggage. The
guard began to tell him about the sensational
dash O’Byrne had made to get away with the
coin, and Kelly momentarily forgot the luggage.
When he looked round he saw Billy carting it
towards the van—or rather he saw a mass of
bags travelling in that direction, and guessed from
the size of the feet that it was Billy that was sup-
plying the locomotive power.
“Here, you whelp ! Is that luggage labelled ?
No, not a sign. Whose is it? Ah, L. Jones !
Confound it, why didn’t you tell me he was here ?’
Billy dropped the luggage and fled, while Kelly
hurried back to the office and reappeared with the
fatal wire. He walked down the train, peering
into each carriage, till he found Mr. Jones nestling
his feet into a head-rest while he lit an enormous
cheroot.
“ Telegram for you, Mr. Jones. They want you
urgently at the Traffic Office ! ” said Kelly, waving
the wire towards Jones.
“May the Devil burst you !” retorted Jones
savagely, waving the burning end of the cheroot
dangerously near the Stationmaster’s face. ‘‘May
he also burst Alexander Mackenzie and Charles
A. Fluter, and all the other noodles and rotters
who can’t run the adjective section for an incan-
descent fortnight on their lurid own ! ” he roared,
shoving the cheroot right into Kelly’s whiskers.
“You’ll be angry in a minute, Mr. Jones, if
you don’t curb yourself,” said Kelly without the
ghost of a smile.
“ Well, wouldn’t you be angry too if you’d made
three shots to get away on a leave that’s three
months overdue and had a mother waiting to
preside over the carving of the fatted turkey ? ”
“ Are you getting out, Mr. Jones? The train
waits !” said the S.M. in a passionless voice.
“Of course I’m getting out—if you’ll give me
time ! ”
He scrambled out and gathered his luggage
together while the S.M. extended his right arm
at right angles to his body. The guard blew his
whistle, and the train lumbered away from the
platform. Then the Old Man walked away to his
office and exploded into a series of deep, gurgling
sounds. He was still gurgling when Jones walked
in with his traps, and depositing them in a corner
mentioned that the air was chilly, and that he
had forgotten the S.M.’s brand.
“ 0.V.G.” said the S.M., making the entries in
his block signal book.
“Do you adulterate it ? ” inquired Jones as he
went out.
“A trifle, just to give it snap,” said the S.M.
Half-an-hour later Jones was telling the Traffic
Clerk what he thought of him, and that officer was
listening with a sardonic smile without ceasing
one moment to write.
“ You can get away to-morrow. Only want you
to take some evidence for Laurence at an inquiry
about a shunting smash out at Hillend this morn-
ing,” said the Traffic Clerk.
“I’ll get away to-night,” snorted Jones, “if
that’s all. I’ll catch the afternoon goods to
Whitestone, and travel up to Wairirimoana in
the Night Mixed, and catch the Stock Special
from there to Ashburnam. They’ll let me down
at the river, where the guv’nor will meet me with
the dog-cart/”
“ Take my tip and wait till to-morrow’s express
—the turkey will keep this weather.”
“I promised the mater I’d dine with her to-
night, and I will, even if it’s midnight, or day-
break to-morrow morning,” said Jones, gathering
up the papers concerning the smash, and making
for the room where the inquiry was to take place.
The inquiry proved to be a longer affair
than he expected. There was a mass of contra-
dictory evidence which he had to sift, and as the
hand of the clock crept round Jones began to per-
spire. Laurence could see no necessity to drive
the witnesses, he said. He much preferred them
to tell their own yarns in their own way. But
Jones anticipated everything, and flatly refused
to adjourn for lunch. The witnesses, finding them-
selves getting mixed, began to explain that they had
meant to say something quite different till they
had got bustled. Jones tried to go slower, but
utterly failed. Just as the case was beginning to
look hopeless, the signalman implicated burst
suddenly into loud sobs, and confessed that he had
blundered.
“Then why the Devil didn’t you say so at
first ? ” said Jones, in a sympathetic tone.
“ Wife and four kids ! ” said the signalman.
Jones swore softly. Laurence strummed with
his fingers on the table : “ Perhaps we can make
it a bit easier for him, Mr. Jones—what do you
think ? ”
“Look here —can you hold up that blanky
goods for half-an-hour ? Tell your fellows to get
behind with the loading—anything. I must
catch that train ; and in half-an-hour I’ll have this
report ready, and save you a deuce of a lot of
trouble and save Wilks his billet.”
“ Well, yes, perhaps ! Is it so very urgent ? ”
“ Urgent isn’t the word for it. Will you do it ? ”
“Er—yes, dashed if I don’t,” said Laurence,
rising and hurrying out. Jones turned to Wilks :
“ Stop that darned row, Wilks; we’ll pull you
out somehow. I must catch that train. Lord
knows what lie I’ll tell, but I’ll think of something
if you’ll only stop snivelling—that gives me
stomach-ache, and I can’t think when I’ve got
stomach-ache.”
“ No, sir ! ” said Wilks, ambiguously.
Jones bent over the desk and wrote for his life,
stopping only to chew the handle of his pen.
Wilks rose to %o. Jones ordered him to sit down.
Then he questioned him about the position of the
signals, and drew a rough plan of the scene of the
smash, which was only one of shunted trucks.
Wilks started to explain. Jones bellowed to him
to shut up, and the signalman fell into the chair
in a limp condition.
When Laurence read that report he groaned.
Then he unbuttoned his corduroy vest and read it
again, groaning louder than ever. He found him-
self committed to a report condemning the
position of the signals, the configuration of the
shunting lines —everything, in fact, barring the
signalman who had blundered. After shaking his
head and swearing with a fluency amazing in one
so elderly and dignified, he seized a pen and wrote
his signature with a spasmodic jerk.
As he did so Jones scrambled on to the outward-
going Northern Goods, as it came snorting across
the street.
• * * ~
The driver of the Goods was a Scot of the
Scotsmen —the worst sort of men for saving time,
because they hate to wear out the engine.
Jones tried to talk Gaelic to him and discovered
that the driver was from Lanark, where it was
once popularly believed that Highlanders were
cannibals. Then he resorted to open bribery,
with the result that the driver overdid it, and
broke down nine miles from Whitestone.
Jones rushed along the line till he found a
ganger. Showing him his pass, he “ persuaded ”
the man to take him into Whitestone on his
velocipede, making the report of the breakdown
his excuse.

THE DANGER
of BACKACHE.
Ail tired out—scarcely enough
energy to get home in the
evening—no rest when you do
get home —as tired in the
morning as at night. The
back is so weak you can
scarcely bend it —aches and
throbs even when you lie still.
The kidneys are to blame.
They are not taking the
poisons out of the blood. They
need help, and need it at once.
Do not disregard the warning
message of the back that
aches, for the ache comes from
the kidneys (which lie just
beneath the small of the
back), and distinctly tells that
uric acid poisons and waste
matter are accumulating in
your body. These are the
poisons that cause dropsy,
Bright’s disease, rheumatism,
bladder troubles, urinary dis-
orders, diabetes.

COLD IN THE KIDNEY CURED*
Mr. James Hudson, 14 Lennox Street, Newtown, Sydney, says “ I work
in the Bondi sewer. There is a constant drip there, and when working it
mostly happens that one is wet through. Some parts are better than others, but
while working in the shafts one is continually damp, ahd this affected my
health. My trouble came with a bad cold in my kidneys, which caused terrible
pains in the back. I did my work, but it was most fearful torture for me to do
so, as you can well understand. I was exceedingly bad with these pains when
I saw Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills advertised, and it struck me by the name
of the remedy that it should be good for my complaint, I procured them, and
they cured me in a fairly quick time. I could not take them constantly, being
afraid to use them while working in the wet sewer, but I managed to take two
doses a week. The nature of my work causes me to have slight returns of
the pains, but I take a dose of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, which never fail
to cure me. lam never without them in the house.”
This statement was made nine years ago. Mrs. Hudson says to-day “My
husband is still well, and free of backache, and he has been ever since he used
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, nine years ago.”
BACKACHE AND WEAK BACK CURED.
Mr. E. R. Davis, Proprietor Somerset Hotel, Station Street, Newtown,
Sydney, says : —“ I suffered for so long with backache and weak back that lam
pleased to tell other sufferers what will cure these distressing ailments. My
experience proves that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are the cure. My back
never ceased aching, and besides the pain and inconvenience, I was afraid of
more serious symptoms of kidney trouble developing. I tried remedy after
remedy, but it was only waste of time and money, and I was so disgusted with
medicines for the kidneys that I would not have tried Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills, but a friend told me they had cured him, and urged me to use them. I
am glad I did, for two boxes cured me. This did not happen yesterday, but
four years ago, and lam still free of the backache. My lasting cure proves
that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills permanently cure backache and weak back.”
DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS are sold by all
Chemists and Storekeepers at 2s. 9d. per box (six
boxes 15s. 3d.), or will be posted on receipt of price

He arrived at the yard just as the bell was
ringring' for the Evening Mixed for Wairirimoana.
Fortunately there was some slight delay, and then
the officer in charge rushed out and waved
his green flag. The train started. It rolled
slowly along, and the officer was about to return
to the office when he saw the apparition of a big,
burly young man in knickerbockers careering
down the platform in pursuit of the train. The
van began to reel away a trifle faster. In front
the driver was blowing his whistle for “clear
line.” The apparition heaved itself at the end of
the van, landed on the step, clung and tried to
enter. The officer saw a guard gesticulating
wildly, saw the stranger’s arm waved frantically,
and then the door flew open, and the burly young
tnan disappeared inside.
“ Rum. go ! said the officer. “Who the Devil
was he, I wonder ? ”
* * * *
The-night officer at Wairirimoana was watching
the Mixed come up to the platform :
“Is the Stock ready, Jardine?” he inquired
from the clerk.
“Yes, sir; just starting now.”
As the Mixed came bowling up, a man sud-
denly sprang from a first-class carriage, landed
just in front of the officer, turned a double somer-
sault, bounded to his feet, and grabbed him by
ithe shoulders :
“ I’m Jones, Romahapa Traffic Office. Where
ithe h— does your Stock Special start from ?
Quick. I must catch it.”
“No hope ! That’s her headlight streaking up
ithe yard. Here, collar this lamp, and make for
ithe crossing at the butt of the breakwater.
•Show him a red light, and when he slows down,
jump on. Give the lamp to the guard. Good
luck ! ”
-Tones and the lamp had gone. The officer
walked to the end of the platform, and watched
•Jones clearing various sets of rails in a series of
wild bounds as if he were a kangaroo. The Stock
Special came rushing up out of the wilderness of
lines and trucks, slowed down as it ran over a
•street, and then made speed again. The driver
•saw a civilian at the crossing waving a red light.
He blew his whistles loudly, shutting off steam as
ihe came up.
As he did so, Jones swarmed on to the engine.
Then the Stock Special rolled away out of the
ring of electric light, and disappeared in the
darkness.
-Tones sat on the coal, puffed but triumphant.
His luck was in, for the driver was his old friend
•Sinclair, the man who believed in the British-
Israelite theory. This was a matter on which
Jones had gone somewhat dotty in his younger
days before he borrowed from Israelites in the
flesh.
“ Ah’m rael bad, th’ nicht ! ” said Sinclair. “Ah
did na’ want tae come oot, but thar was nane tae
itak ma place, so Ah joost had to. An’ Ah dinna
like these new-fangled Yankee engines at all. Yon
•old Tynesider wud tak twice th’ load.”
“What’s the matter with her, Jock? I think
ithe rails must be wet; she seems to be slipping.”
“Ah’ve bin putting doon sand the last mile,
Mr. Jones.”
Jones upended himself, and turned his lamp
•over the side of the engine :
“ Hold her, Jock, we’re running through a mob
of sheep. Why the Devil don’t the things make a
row ? ”
Jock came to a standstill in a flash. Then they
•all got down barring the fireman, who stood to
the brake. The guard and brakesman came for-
ward and swore fluently. Driver Sinclair
addressed himself to the King of Heaven in a
pained tone of voice. Jones delivered a short
address, in which the habits of sheep were
severely condemned, and the policy of the De-
partment in allowing the line to remain unfenced
was described in offensive terms. Sinclair was
inot well,, and the sight of a mile or so covered
with the mangled remains of sheep was the last
•straw. He became absolutely sick, and was un-
able to keep his feet.
“ Wejl, what yer going to do, Jock?” inquired
the guard. “We canna stay here all the night,
you know.”
“ Take him into your van and let him lie down.
I’ll drive the train ! ”
“ But do you know anything about the handling
•of an engine ? ”
“ Hoots, mon ! ’Tis Mr. Jones you’re speakin’
tae. In course he knows all aboot engines. Ah’ll
do it, Mr, Jones, and, please tha Lord, Ah’ll relieve
ye at the bridge.”
And Sinclair tottered towards the van.
When the guard signalled, Jones started at a
snail’s pace. It was a new engine, and at first
Jones was caution itself. He looked at the run-
ning-sheet and then at the engine clock. They
were nearly 29 minutes late already, and there
was a stiff bit of incline work in front of them.
Jones threw his caution to the four winds and
started to force the engine, and kept the fireman
busy slicing.
The fireman had been with men who believed
in slicing a lot before, but never one like this.
He rolled out his orders, and swore fearfully if he
trod on a piece of coal or a clinker as he moved
about the cab.
“Seemed ter think it was a bloomin’ drorin’
room ! ” said the fireman, afterwards ; “ but, my
oath, he moved her along ! ”
They ran down through great cuttings between
shingle cliffs, roared across a bridge, and went
bowling: along a line that ran over a plain as level
as a billiard-table. On either side the waving
autumnal tussock had not been burned off. The
crossings were all level, and the white notice-
boards; bearing the legend : “STOP. Look Out
for the; Engine,” went flittering past like ghosts.
The headlight threw a great circle of light on the
line in front, and beyond that all was darkness,
heavy and impenetrable. Jones kept his eyes
glued on that circle of light. At all the stations
the sigfials were set for “clear line,” and the
great Stock Special went roaring past platf, •; ;n
after platform. The townships were mere islands
in the sea of tussock.
Suddenly, right in front, the whole circle of
light wakffilled by the figure of a man on horse-
back. It was a big roan horse, and he reared up
as his rider smote him with the whip and dug his
spurs deep. Jones’hair lifted his hat right up.
He shut , off steam, he crowded on the steam-
brake, and, as the wheels locked, he reversed,
and, just as they must have struck horse and
rider, the great load behind bumped into the
engine with a shock that threw both driver and
fireman to the floor.
The weight behind drove the train yards.
Jones felt the wheels rise and plough through
something soft, and his heart turned sick.
Then the snorting, struggling engine got the
better of the load behind it, and Jones again shut
off steam. From the cattle trucks behind came
terrified bellows. The sheep, as usual, made no
noise. The guard came racing along.
“What the Devil’s the matter, Mr. Jones?
Did you make a mistake? ”
“Mistake be darned ! Didn’t you feel us go
over something? It’s a man and ahorse. We
must get them out. I hope to God he’s not cut up.”
Then commenced the grim duty of searching
along under the train for remains. They, found
some about 10 yards behind the train—a magnifi-
cent horse, literally cut to pieces, but no sign of
the man.
“ Out on to the side, lads. He’s been hurled
yards. We were running 30 miles an hour when
we struck him. He might be thrown fully 40
yards.”
Up and down, down and up, they searched.
They called and coo-eed. No answer, Jones
hurried along to the front of the engine ah'd
looked at the bar shield usually called the “cow-
catcher,” but it was clear. I’hen he crawled in
under between the wheels, and looked if the body
were tangled in the gear.
“He’s not there!” he said When he had
crawled out. “Tell you what—he’s done a slope.
He must have got clear and made off for fear of
being prosecuted. Although it doesn’t seem
possible. Let’s get that horse off the track.”
“’Tisthe first accident on this bit o’road ! ”
said Sinclair in the van. “’Tis a gude thing the
puir body himsel’ was nae hurted ; but he might
ita’ been theundoin’ o’ us aal.”
“ Where do you water, Jock ? ”
“At Magnolia Grange. They’ll report us from
there. Roon right through tae the water tank on
the northern side, laddie. Are ye on time ? ”
“We are. All on board, i hope that poor
chap’s not gone off injured.”
Back in the cab once more, Jones began to wish
he had taken Fluter’s advice and waited for the
express the following day. It was now past
midnight, and he was still 20 miles away from his
destination, and he felt certain that his father
would have gone back home. Thinking it over,
Jones decided that he did not feel inclined for an
eight-mile walk from the Rangitira Bridge to his
father’s home after this eventful night.
The stations went slipping by, and at last out
of the darkness flashed a distant signal that did
not show clear line. Jones whistled. The light
twinkled a moment and then turned from ruby to
green. Jones slowed down to 15 miles an hour
and saw the home signal against him. He slowed
down to 10, the green light gleamed a welcome,
and slowly past the long platform rolled the train
on to where the tanks gleamed ruddily in the
glare of the headlight. There was an officer with
a couple of porters on the platform as he went by.
He brought the engine to a standstill at the tank,
and the fireman scrambled out to fix the hose.
The Stationmaster came along and glanced into
the engine. He had been at Magnolia Grange
ever since it was a station, and Jones had known
him when he was a little boy going to school.
“Good morning, Mr. Mayton! You didn’t
expect to see me !” and Jones stepped out and
shook hands with the old officer.
“Oh yes, I did. I’ve a message for you. They
knew you were coming on the Stock, but I ex-
pected to find you in the van. Come and have a
sip of coffee. I’m pleased to see you—long while
since you were home.”
“ Yes. Sometimes I wish I’d never left it. How
is Mrs. Mayton ? ”
“ Oh just the temper is, if anything,
worse than ever, but we put up with it on account
of her affliction, you know.”
They had just finished the coffee when Mayton
Started up.
“God bless me soul, I forgot all about the
passenger in front. It must be cold there. Ask
him to have a mug of coffee. Is he a friend of :
yours, Mr. Jones?”
“ Who ? What passenger ? ” said Jones, as the
porter hurried out to do his officer’s bidding.
“The gentleman sitting on the track-finder
under the funnel, you know ! ”
Jones gaped at him. Then his knees gave way.
“ Was there somebody there ? ” he whispered.
“Certain of it—saw higi distinctly. Didn’t
you know ? ”
The porter entered the office, taking off his cap.
“Don’t think he wants any, sir; he never
answered me.”
“Good Lord ! That must be the man we ran
over,” said Jones, springing to his feet and hurry-
ing out.
He was huddled up right under the funnel,
looking for all the world as though asleep. Jones
and a porter climbed on to lift him off.
“ He’s stunned, sir,” said the porter.
“I’m afraid he’s dead,” said Jones, laying his
hand on the arm of the passenger. Then he
slipped his hand inside his shirt.
“Thought so. Here, what are you frightened
of ? ” as the porter started to get down.
“ Don’t like dead people, sir ! ”
“Perhaps not—but you’ll be dead yourself
some day, and then you won’t like people to
shrink from you. Poor chap, poor chap ! ”
And the big. powerful young officer took the
corpse by the shoulders, and pulled it from where
it had been wedged by that terrific impact, out to
the edge of the track-finder.
“Jump down, porter, and take his feet as I
lower him.”
Then springing down he lowered the body, and
they carried it to the ladies’ waiting-room, and
laid it on the table, where Jones tried to discover
some sign of life.
“ It’s no good, Mr. Jones. The man is cold !
said the old S.M. “All we can do is find out who
he is, and let his friends know first thing in the
morning. I’ve sent for the doctor, and lie will lie
here in a minute. Can’t understand what’s killed
him—no signs of injuries.”
“No, and look here,” said Jones, diving his
hands into the pockets and pulling out an un-
broken flagon of whisky and a‘ gold watch that
was still ticking away with its crystal face
uncracked.
The doctor hurried in. He made the usual
examination, then pointed to a tiny blue mark on
the man’s left temple, just above the corner of’
his eye.
“ Concussion of the brain. You can do nothing.
It’s Mr. Monteith. of Woodlands Station.”
* ■* * *
Another 15 minutes went in drafting out the
telegraphic report, and then Sinclair was put to
bed in the Railway Hotel, and the driver of a
local train was hauled out of bed to take the Stock
Special on to Ashburnam. Jones rode the rest of
the way to the Rangitira Bridge in the van. His
thoughts were gloomy.
The train slowed down with a succession of
bumps.
“The Rangitira Bridge, Mr. Jones,” said the
guard.
Jones stepped to the platform and swung him-
self off. Hg waved his hand to the guard, and
then strode through the starlight to where his
father had left a saddle horse for him. He roused
nobody at the hotel, but silently saddled up, and
rode home to where his mother was waiting, fully
dressed, on a sofa, to give him a royal welcome.
She wondered why her hilarious son was so
depressed. She learned next dav when he rode
away to give himself up to stand the inevitable
trial for “causing the death of Murray Mon-
teith,” a misdemeanor of which he was, of course,
honorably acquitted.

A friend insisted that I should
try Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. After I
had taken about half a bottle
my appetite got better and I be-
gan to be quite light-hearted. . I
was quite well and strong before
I had finished the sixth bottle,
but to make sure I took in all
eight bottles.”
E. T. Moore,
Adelaide.
AYER’S Sarsaparilla
makes the blood rich in red corpuscles, thereby imparting to it new life-
giving power. Begin taking it at once. Day after day you will slowly
but steadily feel yourself growing stronger and stronger.
As now made, Ayer’s Sarsaparilla contains no alcohol.
There are many imitation Sarsaparillas that will disappoint
you. Get “AYER’S.” •

Familiar Quotations
pregnant with meaning are being handed down from one generation to
another. Many examples might be quoted, and their applicability to the
subject* of health noted. For example, “Forewarned is forearmed.”
Directly symptoms of a disordered Stomach appear, that is “the warning,”
and all the “arming” that is necessary is a box of Beech AM’S Pills.
“A stitch in time saves nine.” Beech AM’S Pills will quickly arrest any
disposition to Stomach, Liver, or Kidney trouble.
“Worth a Guinea a Box”
This is another familiar quotation but applying specially to BEECHAM’S
Pills. These enjoy a popularity that can be claimed by no other
preparation: and the last named expression has become proverbial
because thousands of people all over the world have benefitted by the
use of the medicine to which it refers. For really buoyant health—free-
dom from ache or pain—a system attuned alike to work or pleasure—take
Beecham’s Pills.
Sold everywhere in boxes , price lllh (56 pills) & 219 (168 pills).
