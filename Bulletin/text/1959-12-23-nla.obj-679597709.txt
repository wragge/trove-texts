IS IT LITERATURE?
There are in all categories of factual
writing at least some books which have
literary merit, and it is an error of
criticism to exclude any book from
the field of literature merely because
it is a work of information rather than
of imagination.
To quote an example, Gibbon’s
Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire is a factual work which is
also a great work of literature. It may
be read with delight, not only for the
factual information that it contains,
but also for its beauty of language,
and the power of imagery in its style.
A literary work becomes memorable
chiefly by its originality—not only of
ideas, but also of verbal expressions.
The quality of originality, in both con-
tent and form, is sometimes termed
“creativeness” —but that is a term too
glibly used. It claims too much, and
encourages writers to strive too self-
consciously to be “different.”
The aim of good writing is to please,
or to inform, or at least to satisfy the
reader. Graceful expression, or some-
times powerful expression, is a requisite
in literature; but it is not the only
requisite. The author should have
“something to say.” If his ideas are
new, or true, or original, his style may
be graceful, or powerful, or striking, to
conform with those ideas. In the full
analysis, it is the meaning of a literary
work —whether it be a printed book or
a carved message-stick—that is its pre-
dominant purpose, to which literary
style, as such, should be subordinated.
Even novelists must be concerned
basically with facts. Like dramatists
they must “hold the mirror up to
nature”—and poets, too, if their work
is to endure, must also do just that.
In its nature, factual writing puts
emphasis on meaning, and subordinates
style to the practical purpose of
imparting information. Nevertheless,
when the information is of a remark-
able kind, and, more essentially, if the
writer imparting the information has
the “literary” gift of lucid, powerful, or
charming expression, then a factual
work has as much right as any other
to be considered as a contribution to
the literature of a nation, or even of
the world.
Many Australian factual writings
are of literary merit, but their
systematic study has been neglected
by students of literature. That neglect,
I believe, stems from an outmoded
conception of literary criticism, which
was based on a snobbish scorn for
mere facts.
That conception—widely held a
century ago—was succinctly expressed
by the celebrated Professor T. G.
Tucker, an Englishman who was
appointed Professor of Classical
Philology at the University of Mel-
bourne in 1885, and occupied that chair
for thirty-five years, until his retire-
ment in 1920. His long-sustained
influence was directed to discouraging
what he called “provincialism” in Aus-
tralian literature. I quote from a
lecture which he delivered to the Aus-
tralian Literature Society in 1902: —
By “literature” we shall mean
creative literature, the literature of
feeling, imagination and invention,
not mere books—not what Lamb
calls biblia abiblia, “things in
books’ clothing,” such as works of
description, of mathematics, of
science, dictionaries and the like.
This romantic tendency, as I view
it, to apply literary validity only to
works of imagination and invention,
has ample authority and precedent. For
[A condensed version of a Com-
monwealth Literary Fund lecture
given by P. R. Stephensen at
Adelaide University.]
example. Morris Miller in his valuable
survey of Australian literature (1940)
limited his scope to poetry, drama,
fiction and (literary) criticism.
But in his introduction to those
volumes Professor Miller made it clear
that this limitation was arbitrary and
regrettable. He pointed out that in
the definition of literature there is “a
place for writers in the fields of
religion, philosophy, history, art and
science, whose style and manner of
treatment may be accepted as of value
for their own sake as distinct from a
purely expository intention.” He
expressed the hope that other compilers
would prepare critical bibliographies
of Australian literature in these fields.
But the work as revised by Frederick
T. Macartney still includes many
minor works of fiction, poetry and
drama which could fairly be described
as imaginative rubbish, while at the
same time omitting many factual works
of enduring literary value.
A fuller treatment is promised in
H. M. Green’s A History of Aus-
tralian Literature, to be published next
year in two bulky volumes. Accord-
ing to the publishers it will deal not
only with the conventional “literary”
categories of poetry, fiction, drama and
essays, but also with factual writing in
the fields of biography, history, travel
and description, science, economics,
politics and works dealing with educa-
tion and religion.
It would be worse than useless for us
in Australia to base our standards of
literary criticism on those that were
evolved in England in the elegant
Eighteenth Century or the romantic
Nineteenth Century. Times have
changed. The Twentieth Century is
the age of the practical. It is an age
of facing facts. In Australia—a nation
that is still in the formative stage —-
our attitude to our immediate environ-
ment must be, as it has been for the
past 171 years of building-up a new
homeland for the white race in this
continent—chiefly practical and prag-
matical. And. in that sense, factual
writing in Australia would have a
stronger role to play in the develop-
ment of Australian literature than
mere fantasy, imagination or abstract
astheticism. Call it what you will,
the extension of human knowledge,
based on the systematisation of facts,
and on inferences drawn from facts, is
more “creative” than fantasy-thinking.
And so I offer for your consideration
fourteen classes of Australian prose
works, which are not fiction, poetry,
or drama but may nevertheless have
literary merit—any mention of authors
and titles here is only sketchily selec-
tive. to illustrate the various classes.
(i) Voyages of Discovery: These
comprise more than 100 published
narratives of the Spanish, Dutch,
French. Russian and British navigators
who for 300 years, from the Sixteenth
to the Nineteenth Century, made sea-
explorations of the coasts and oceanic
environs of the Autralian continent.
Most of these works are out of print.
They should all be reprinted in a
standard “Australian Classic” paper-
back series, similar in format to the
English “Penguin Books.” I find the
narratives of these old-time mariners
enthralling in both content and style.
They are both factual and eloquent.
They are documentations of vivid
experience, with an overtone of wonder.
They are at the same time history and
literature. They are the Odysseys of
Australia’s Homeric Age. Partial
reprints or “digests” will not do. Each
Voyage is a unity, an enterprise com-
pleted.
(ii) Inland Exploring Expeditions.
There are also more than 100 pub-
lished, partly-published, or unpub-
lished Journals of the inland explorers
of Australia, from 1788 until the
1880’s. Here are documentations of
real experience, written by men of
adventurous spirit, who often suffered
hardships, but were lured on by the
“beckoning horizons” of Terra Aus-
tralis Incognita. Most of the journals
.of the inland explorers are out of print.
Here again is scope for a classic
reprint library of source-material that
is not merely “historical” but often

not made; and for that reason few
of them make their marks and are
remembered when they go away, or
retire. Who can remember even the
names of most of Australia’s vice-
roys? In fact, few after the ordeal is
over want to remember themselves in
their vice-regal roles.
Until recently they were asked to
manage a regime marked by incessant
and monotonous hard work and short-
age of money that amounted almost
to penury, succeeded by a period of
retirement in which they were acutely
conscious that they had had to dig
deeply into their own pockets to cover
expenses.
This has been partly mended recently
and has produced an access of both
hospitality and dignity in keeping with
that of the head of a nation grown
to high international status. But
Governors-General still do not receive
pensions, and nothing is conceded by
the Commonwealth to their dignity
after they have left Yarralumla.
The surviving Australian appointee
is not even conceded public transport
on official occasions, and Lord Gowrie.
after many years of difficult and
devoted service, was glad, when his
term was finished, to accept a “grace
and favor” lodging from the Crown
in England.
There is no provision whereby a
former Governor-General, even if he
has served a long term and has passed
in office to an age at which he can
expect to fill no further positions, has
a way of obtaining a pension unless
he has one by right due to services
rendered to the Crown elsewhere. Yet
there are means whereby a member
of Parliament who is in the House no
longer than some Governors-General
serve can get a fairly substantial one —
enough to keep the wolves both from
his own and his wife’s door.
'THERE seems an argument for some
A reforms in connection with pen-
sions for the Governor-Generalship,
though it is not an immediate issue,
since Field-Marshal Sir William Slim,
who is leaving us. is both a Field-
Marshal and full of vigor, and his
successor has a sufficient pension as
Speaker of the House of Commons.
At the same time, it is one of the
great deterrents against acceptance of
the office by men of high standing
that they must spend five or ten years
at Canberra outside the normal current
of their lives and isolated from their
natural associations. For most of them,
if they are career-men in politics, it
means the end. with no security there-
after.
It is essential that the dignity of the
office shall not be lowered through
the necessities which afflict those who
retire from it; but. equally, if a
pension-system were established, it
should be hedged round with condi-
tions which would assure that it was
not a mere gift from a particular Gov-
ernment but a regular right.
Part of the argument for pensions
is that despite the fact that allowances
are now made for various expenses
which were not there . before, a
Governor-General always suffers in
pocket, and will continue to suffer in
pocket after he leaves office, especially
if he continues to live in Australia.
The public view of the matter has
always been colored with a certain
feeling natural to a new and demo-
cratic country and fostered by agita-
tion from the radical Left that G.-G.s
are excrescences, or figureheads,
machines on which to hang gaudy
uniforms and oiled-up to shake
innumerable moistly eager hands.
It is possible for a Governor-
General to be of that order; but as has
been proved, especially by Sir William
Slim, he need not be. and when he isn’t
he becomes a valuable Constitutional
figure and the best kind of public-
relations officer that a Government can
get.
He becomes the counsellor of those
in high authority. The Government
has the benefit of his sound common-
sense. and if he models himself on the
late King George VI and has the right
personality and approach he can have
a large influence on the atmosphere of
a Government and even, in crisis, on
actual events.
He, by his contacts with the public,
puts both the Crown and the Constitu-
tion to the people at a level and in a
way that is not possible for anybody
else in the Common wealth. This Sir
William Slim has done naturally and
with the success which is achievable
only by sincerity and hard work and
a man’s belief in the need for, and
importance of. the job he is doing.
Viewed in the light of an expres-
sion of national unity, the Governor-
Generalship is a job that calls for all
the talents.
CIR WILLIAM SLIM brought to the
task a basically civilian education
—he was a schoolmaster before his
enlistment in the ranks of the British
Army in World War I.
He has much in common with the
large body of Australian civilian
soldiers, since he has understood their
experiences.
He has a catholic knowledge of
mankind and of the art of handling
men. He has led a full life and has
learned to mix socially and with
genuine pleasure with Gurkha and
Australian alike. And his record is
such that it inspires awe rather than
mere respect.
He differs from vice-regals of the
hereditary - peerage vintage in that
though he has lived nearer to a regal
state than most other Governors-
General, he has earned this right by
sheer ability to wear every decoration
and medal that he displays, the cul-
minating honor being the Order of the
Garter, an unprecedented recognition
of his vice-regal service. The short
roll of that predominant order of
chivalry is half made-up of kings and
Royal princes, and contains, among
men risen from lower estate, only the
greatest names of World War 11,
headed by that of Sir Winston
Churchill.
Sir William Slim has been every-
where in Australia. He has got to
know as many people as a human
who is forthcoming and friendly and
genial can, given a limited time to
make acquaintanceships.
He has established during his Aus-
tralian period of office a number of
separate reputations which must be
nearly unique in Australian life. As a
soldier his record speaks for itself; as
a speaker he is superb; as a writer he
would be a national figure in his own
right.
He has done a tremendous service
towards stabilising a proper conception
of what the Governor-Generalship
stands for and wherein the usefulness
of the office lies. And he has set a high
standard for his successors to follow.
While wishing him and Lady Slim
long life and happiness. Australians
will regret that they must lose from
the community somebody who has
come to be thought of as a great Aus-
tralian with a rare knowledge of the
country and its resources and an abid-
ing faith and interest in its future.


"I'D SOONER HAVE THE BALLOON!"


PLAIN ENGLISH
The Productivity Gap
In the past year the cost-of-living rose
by about four per cent., and the rise
in the coming year is likely to be greater,
the researchers of the Institute of Public
Affairs Victoria report. They are
qualified, independent fact finders and
turn out expert jobs.
They describe the recent margins
judgment as dispensing a measure of
justice to the skilled worker who had
fallen behind in the past five years ;
but the national wage-and-salary bill
will probably rise by between £IOO
million and £l5O million as a result of
the judgment, and basic-wage rates have
also been raised within the past four
years.
It now seems certain that wages are
far outstripping the productivity gain
of between one and two per cent, a year,
and the question arises whether the
whole approach towards wage-fixing in
Australia is outdated and due for
sweeping revision. Too often Govern-
ment economic policies and aims appear
to be pulling in opposite directions to
those of wage-fixing authorities.
The Institute says it would be wishful
thinking to suggest that the size of the
recent wage-increases would not sub-
stantially increase prices, but this pill
was accepted with some complacency,
probably by some of the Institute's
sponsors, too, because of assurances from
sources, regarded in the past as authorita-
tive, that the trend of 'production was
upward.
A rise of one or two per cent, a year
is upward, but it is of little value when
living-costs are rising by four per cent.,
with bigger rises in prospect. The
widening gap is dangerous.
Austerity v. Inflation
Hints are being given from influential
quarters that the Federal Government
is seriously concerned with inflation
(now no longer “creeping,” but going at
a steady trot), and especially with the
human and political problems associated
with the means-test and the plight of
the thrifty elderly in the community.
There are suggestions that 1960 (a non-
election year) will see some “unpopular”
measures, although none about the
Government facing the need for some
economies in the public service or in
the pay and allowances of members of
Parliament.
The relaxing of import-controls has
been part of the plan to drain-off surplus
funds, to increase the supply of goods
in relation to spending-power, and also
to produce some revenue for the Govern-
ment. The call-up into special account
of more of the funds of the trading-
banks has been another move to check
inflation. Yet it is believed that none
of these will be fully effective against
the situation likely to develop before
the next Federal Budget, and that docu-
ment may have some unpleasant sur-
prises for taxpayers. If the Government
has plans for “austerity,” it might be
wise to start “conditioning” the public
now, giving full and adequate reasons
for any such proposals.
Australians may or may not find the
reasons offered sufficient to make any
medicine acceptable, if not palatable, but
Menzies, Holt and Co. can be well
assured that there will be a violent pro-
test unless there is simultaneously some
evidence of economies in the place where
they are most needed, most overdue and
most visible —the public services and the
Parliaments themselves. The Govern-
ment, if it is convinced of the need for
some lowering of what we term “the
standard of living,” should be prepared
to face the political implications of a firm
stand against the large and entrenched
ranks of public servants and their rela-
tives in their dual roles of taxpayers
and voters. The Government can’t expect
to have it both ways—and it won’t get it.
Rival Messiahs
Though the United Kingdom has agreed
to resume at least tentative diplomatic
relationships with the Federal Arab
Republic and the unstable Nasser, fresh
trouble seems to be rising in the Middle
East, probably due to the competition
of Cairo’s tyrant with his rival Kassem
of Baghdad.
Nasser has never let-up the pressure
against Israel and Jordan, but he has
been careful not to go so far as to
invoke the intervention of the Western
Powers.
Now, however, he seems to find him-
self in a cleft stick, and he has been
challenged to justify his posing as the
Messiah of Arab greatness and the
rescuer of Arab nationalities from the
clutches of both the Hebrews of Pales-
tine and the Gentiles of the West.
Kassem is freshly from hospital, into
which he went bloodstained and ex-
hausted with his labors of wiping-out
his enemies; his vigor seems to be
restored, for he was no sooner out of
the ward than he began warning the oil
companies that their concession-terri-
tories were to be reduced irrespec-
tive of existing agreements, and assuming
the mantle of liberator of Palestine
with some hints that this might not be
the only bit of territory adjacent to Iraq
in need of liberation. His side-glances
at Jordan, whose King Hussein is in the
United Kingdom, seemed' ominous.
Nasser appears to have been put on
his mettle by this barefaced rivalry. He
is faced with the possible necessity of
having his thunder stolen and being fore-
stalled by the upstart of Baghdad.
Hence, presumably, his actions as
reported during the past week are the
answer to the challenge which has been
developing for some time.
For the past three months there have
been reports, more or less vague, of
naval manoeuvres and of the strengthen-
ing of the Egyptian forces. Certainly
some parts of Egypt towards the canal
have appeared to discerning visitors very
much like a war-zone.
Also, the speech of Kassem in which
he denounced the interference of certain
people in the Israel question seems
to have brought Nasser out into the
open to some extent; it is reported that
he has been intensifying the blockade
which has been symbolised by his refusal
to permit vessels carrying goods for
Israel to pass through the canal.
He has been quietly mustering large
forces in the Sinai Peninsula and taking
steps to block the Jordan River irriga-
tion-scheme, being implemented by Israel
with a view to settling four-million more
Jews on desert areas which are now
almost uninhabited.
It may all be powder-play, but the
powder is highly explosive, and has open
fires all round its storage-place.
Spare the Boot!
School speech-days have brought with
them the usual quota of advice and
admonitions, pupils and parents
sharing more-or-less equally those that
aren’t aimed at impersonal culprits such
as the system or the Nuclear Age.
A headmistress in North Queensland
set the ball rolling by saying she feared
she had been educating a generation of
spinsters because none but millionaires
would be able to cope with the expensive
tastes affected by some of her students.
She deplored the giving by parents of
expensive gifts for minor successes and
the belief current among her pupils that
such things were their due. Principals
of other schools weighed-in with warn-
ings on the unwisdom of teenage girls
having “steadies,” the effect of TV on
children’s studies, parental lavishness
with pocket-money and the tendency of
parents to ascribe the successes of their
children to the influence of heredity and
their failures to the inefficiency of their
teachers.
Roy Wheeler, M.H.R., struck a fresh
note when he called for an end to “the
open season on so-called ‘delinquent
parents’,” and a correspondent of the
Sydney '“Herald” remarked that we hear
lots of talk of failures being due to
the laziness of children or the indulgence
of parents, but never a suggestion that
it may be due to inefficient teaching—
or delinquent teachers.
Professor Messel also broke new
ground by suggesting the necessity for a
longer school-year. Mothers, no doubt,
would be all in favor of this proposal,
but the N.S.W. Teachers’ Federation
quickly "opposed it, saying that the
children have a long-enough school year
already. Maybe they’re right, but the
teachers’ reaction to the Professor’s sug-
gestion could also be inspired by the
fact that by the end of the school year
they've had all they can take of the kids.
Most, workers envy the teachers their
holidays, but not many envy them their
jobs.
Final word on the subject seems to
come from the U.S. judge who last week
gave a verdict in a case where a teacher


had been dismissed because he had kicked
one of his pupils. Taking the view that
in certain cases where stern measures
are called for a kick in the pants may
bring salutary results, the judge ordered
the reinstatement of the teacher. He
added that it was possible that if a few
more teachers took similar action there
might be fewer juvenile delinquents. In
other words: Spare the boot and spoil
the child!
Eisenhower's Tour
Sometimes in Asia there was an air of
paternalism behind the speeches of
President Eisenhower which smelt more
than faintly of the kind of colonialism
which the United States has always pro-
fessed to deprecate.
The addresses to the Indians in the
early part of the visit might have been
written by a Congress Indian. They
reiterated the time-worn sentiments of
the Indian architects of “freedom” with
an approval that seemed to condemn
the policy of European nations in
general and leave the inference that
India’s only (or, at least, greatest) friend
was that democratic nation, holder of
the patent on liberty, the United States
of America.
They seemed to be meant to feel out
the atmosphere to discover whether it
was wise to go a little further, which
the President did towards the close of
his visit, with some extraordinary
utterances.
These told the Indians that “we, the
United States and India, are alike at
bottom,” which they certainly are not
in any material respect except in their
love of theory and idealism.
From there he went on to invoke the
ghost of Gandhi as a probable backer
of Republican Presidential policy. He
was sure that if Gandhi were alive this
“most saintly of men would support
America’s right to maintain a respectable
establishment for defence and their duty
to join in company with like-thinking
peoples for mutual self-defence.”
He hinted at great financial support
from New York to the right kind of
India in an assurance that from now
onward he “would be quick to speak
out on every possible occasion saying
that India is becoming one of the greatest
investment opportunities of our time.”
The President’s Greek visit was only
one day long, but he addressed the
Greek Parliament with a new note in
his voice, stressing the military strength
of the United States as an instrument
of peace in quite a different tone from
that of his line in India, where Nehru
seems to believe that no kind of strength,
even when dedicated to the production
of peace, is quite respectable, if in the
last resort a regrettable necessity.
The relations with the Greeks were
somewhat marred by the prior announce-
ment that the United States would re-
sume relations with Bulgaria. But Mr.
Hagerty, the President’s press factotum,
told the Greeks that the President was
in Athens partly to help maintain a
strong Greece and that he and the Greeks
“saw eye to eye on all Greek problems.”
Very embarrassing interpretations may
be placed on this in the Aegean, par-
ticularly in relation to Cyprus.
In his travels the President had missed
the plague-spots of unrest in the Middle
East.
In Paris he faces submerged con-
flict with France, which has been
accentuated by the schoolmasterliness of
the American commanders, the speech
of one of whom, General Twining, Chief
of Staff, leaked out and has hurt French
pride and that of some of the other 13
nations in Nato. The General criticised
the “dragging feet” of some nations such
as France, which agrees that Nato
is indispensable, but is not anxious to
allow the United States to maintain
sovereign power over any kind of defence
on French soil, or to arrange the defence
of Europe on a basis of open and
frank exchange of knowledge which
will leave the Americans all the
time in a special position in which they
can choose the venue of their operations,
but keep their secrets from their allies
even about installations on allied soil.
France, one of the imminently
threatened nations in the event of world
war with the Communist Powers, is
seriously a prey to anxiety because of
the American failures in the rocket and
nuclear field and seems to feel that,
apart from the matter of prestige, it
should begin to see what it can do itself
with nuclear development.
It is certain that unless the European
nations bring their defences up to
strength their stand for independence
will not be justified.
At present they provide only 12 out
of the 21 divisions in the Nato force—
the proportions are U.S. nine, West
Germany seven, France three and the
United Kingdom two.
The Europeans are 10 divisions short
of Nato planned strength.
Beer, But No Pub
It becomes increasingly evident in Vic-
toria that a complete overhaul of the
licensing laws must be undertaken or it
will shortly be impossible for other than
the more rugged drinkers to get near the
diminishing bars at all at peak hours.
The latest to announce a closure is
the Port Phillip Club. The Licensing
Court agreed to the withdrawal of an
application by Carlton and United
Breweries for a licence for 1960, and
the hotel will close on December 31.
Judge Fraser described this brewery house
as deplorable.
There were no bedrooms available for
the public, the upstairs bedrooms were
covered in dust, and the judge said he
had page after page of complaints from
licensing-inspectors about the hotel. The
immediate question, of course, is why
the conditions were allowed to continue
when the yearly licences were granted,
and the explanation can be only that,
beerhouse exclusively as it was, it did
give some counter-space in a city where
the population is rising rapidly and the
bars decreasing.
In the last few years 13 hotels have
closed in inner Melbourne, all because
of economic pressure from more lucra-
tive businesses for the hotel-space, and
when the rot set-in in earnest, in 1955,
the Bolte Government promised to intro-
duce legislation licensing premises for
bar- and snack-trade, and others, with
lower taxation, for the traditional hotel
trade of liquor, good meals and
accommodation.
Nothing further was heard of it; and if
the Premier was running true to the form
he displayed on the off-course tote issue,
he first consulted the Council of
Churches to ask if he might introduce
the bill and was told “No!”
Even the licensing of additional drink-

pleasant conditions in a State still sub-
ject to 6 p.m. closing. Another referendum
on later-closing is due if a referendum
really is necessary; and this time
the anti-nark campaign might be better
handled than it was on the last occa-
sion if the beer-traders, with their luke-
warm support, were kept in the back-
ground and representative citizens
handled the case for civil liberty and
adult living.
S
Petrol from Cool
About the same time that Senator
Spooner, the Minister for National
Development, was assuring the Senate
when introducing the bill to increase the
scope of the Petroleum Search Subsidy
Act that the Federal Government was
sure oil would be found in Australia in
commercial quantities, Dr. R. S.
Andrews, chairman of the Gas and Fuel
Corporation of Victoria, was pointing-
out that the arresting fact was that it
hadn’t found it.
He suggested to 200 delegates at the
annual conference of the Australasian
Institute of Mining and Metallurgy that
it was time serious consideration was
given to producing synthetic fuels from
our known vast deposits of coal; and
later he came up with the prediction that
Australia would begin to starve two
months after any total interruption to
overseas oil supplies.
Dr. Andrews was chief chemist of the
corporation from 1927 until he was
appointed chairman, and his career has
been devoted to investigating, and
impressing influential persons with, the
importance of brown coal as a source
of town gas, electricity and liquid fuel.
According to Dr. Andrews’s reckoning,
the investment of £54 million would
produce 70-million gallons of petrol and
oil a year from coal in N.S.W. and Vic-
toria ; for £9 million the corporation
could be equipped to produce 20-million
gallons of petrol and oil a year from
Morwell’s brown coal, and for an outlay
of £45 million, up to 70-million gallons
could be won from N.S.W. black coal.
Only about two months’ supply of
petrol and oil are held in reserve in
Australia. After it was exhausted a
large section of transport and almost all
farm machinery would be stopped.

an alert police-officer in a frill-less, collar-
less khaki suit, plain pyjama style, sitting

lar “Jack.” My son-
in-law and a young
fellow-worker, both
in their twenties, are
always “John,”
never “Jack.” My
own young hopeful
is James to everyone
except the family
doctor, who prefers
to address him as
“Jim.” Yet I have
always been “Jim”
or “Jimmy,” even
though my father,
the first “James,”
was always “Jim.” We were always
distinguished by the labels “Old Jim”
and “Young Jim,” but there is no con-
fusion between my offspring and me.
The lad up the street, now at High
School, is always “David,” never “Dave.”
Another youngster I know is “Phillip,”
never “Phil.”

T agree with Clement Hosking’s
comments about “Silent Night” (B.
16/12/’59); and as a parish-church
organist, I think I can give an answer
to Mr. Hosking’s remark that, “for some
unfathomable reason,” choirboys are
mightily interested in Christmas carols.
It seems to me to boil down to Christmas
coming but once a year, and special
music (i.e., music not normally offered at
any other time) being used for these
festivals. Choirboys, along with choir-
masters, tend to get sick of the ever-
lasting round of familiar hymns. From
the chorister’s point of view, Easter
in a parish-church is musically only
mildly interesting. It would be unusual
to hear people around the house singing
Easter hymns. Maybe this is because
Easter combines joy with gravity. But
Christmas is different. In the choirboy’s
eyes, Christmas hymns are carols.
Christmas hymns give choirboys a
legitimate excuse for shouting, their heads
off. It doesn’t much matter ; only once
a year ; and the congregation joyously
shouts back. You can have patriotic
songs and sea-chanties any old time —
some authorities recommend using them
at choir-practices, to relieve the essen-
tially heavy nature of church-music —but
there is only one time for carols. I
suppose, if the tunes of popular
Christmas hymns were used intermit-
tently throughout the Church’s year, they
would lose, in the long-run, most of their
appeal.—“A. W.”

daughter, cet. 9, was a real little devil —
amid hoots of mirth we asked her what
did she expect? Then one of the quietest

answer to her query did he understand
what she’d been telling him, he said, “Of

attribute any cheeseparings to their host’s
parsimony. The rajah held several State
banquets every week ; so over 20 years
and more the butler showed a nice profit
by providing the half-dozen who sat near
his Highness with champagne, those

“A.E.0.”: Mention of the ready wit

businessmen and a couple of solicitors
frequently heckled him. But Georgie
deflated them, stopping his speech, walk-

riveting attention to the noisy group:
“When some primitive intelligences get

“Ddddorian”: First of the Christmas-

at a city restaurant. The only flaw in
this complimentary pearl was my organ-
lesson ; just before 2 p.m. I stubbed
the cigar so kindly provided, said good-
bye and walked through the rosy streets
of Sydney to the cathedral. When I got
inside, a group of workmen were
struggling with a Christmas-tree: they
were trying to make it stand-up in a tub.
Several helpers were rather foolishly
stationed in the pipework high above
the nave, calling out directions and
waving their arms. “Ha, I thought, I
know how to make you jump” . . . but
a few minutes later I made myself jump,
for beer, Riesling, champagne and
liqueur were working on my fingertips.
I gave the Christmas-tree people a loud,
brief and inaccurate burst; and I hate
to imagine what my organ-teacher
thought as he hurried up to the console
to silence the unleashed monster.

“Sunray”: There’s one lad who’s all

throw it out the window. A real jet,
bar the noise! It was great fun till the
saucer of metho tipped onto his hands,
and they caught alight, too. He tried
to beat out the flames on his tummy ;
his jumper caught alight, and only the
presence of mind of his sister, who made
him lie flat on a bed, saved him from

the reading-room when a head appeared
round the doorway—Browning, Crown
Prosecutor, on circuit with the Judge:
“I wonder whether you’d make a fourth
for some bridge?” Well, I’m no card-
player, and 3d. a 100’s my limit, but
not wishing to appear unsociable, into
the card-room I went. There were
Browning, the Judge (who struck me as
a somewhat peppery gentleman), some


other legal bird and “Ceg.” We sat
down to double Scotches, and after the
steward had brought two fresh packs
of cards the Judge and the Crown
Prosecutor played together and I was
with the other legal gent. No mention
was made of stakes. I soon saw that I
was with some pretty good bridge-
players, but my mug’s luck held and
my partner and I got on all right. Not
so the other two, who criticised each
other’s play with a good deal of sting.
Long post-mortems after each hand were
washed down with Scotch; so it went.
Somewhere about midnight time was
called and chequebooks produced. It

me a time of frustration and humor.
Baulked on my plan to be home with

I was held-up in Perth by a shipping-

a blotto Digger leaning on a horse-trough.
Sighting me in the black accoutre-

hat off, and said, “Always shalute the
Black Watch.”
'T'he dear old boy toiling up the

Pimpernel of Our Public Life
By "OBSERVER"
At Canberra’s plush Hotel
Ainslie-Rex, one day a
few weeks back, a man
with a high-domed, in-
telligent forehead, clipped grey
moustache and down-to-earth
Australian accent declared
open the conference of the
Australian regional groups of
the Royal Institute of Public
Administration.
There before him, met to
play variations on the theme
the conference was due to pro-
pound for the next couple of
days—“ Public Service Manage-
ment: The Importance of
Classification, Promotion and
Arbitration” —was the largest
collection of leading public ser-
vants ever to meet under one
roof in Australia.
Probably the most remark-
able thing about the confer-
ence was the fact that the
chairman, the man to whom
the Royal Institute of Public
Administration in this country
largely owes its spectacular
growth, is himself not a public
servant.
But, then, Geoffrey Cochrane
Remington, Sydney solicitor,
and man of many preoccupa-
tions, is a remarkable man.
That same crusading zeal
which sends a man from the
beaten path in the name of
science, politics or religion
urged him into fields far less
spectacular—the unrewarding
fields of public administration
and public culture, where none
but the most intrepid ever
venture.
That was 30-odd years ago
Now in his early sixties,
possessed of tremendous funds
of energy, he is still laboring
in those select fields.
Geoff Remington was not
actuated, as was Rhett Butler
(who joined the Confederate
Army when the South had lost
that war in America) because
he had a sympathy for lost
causes. Remington would
never admit the loss of any-
thing that was worth fighting
for.
Early in his career he de-
cided that the cause of public
servants was in need of some-
one to champion it —a much
more formidable undertaking
three decades back than it
might seem now. The eleva-
tion of the public servant in
the public esteem, per se, would
have been challenge enough,
but Remington thought, as did
Stanley Baldwin, that “the
welfare of the common man
is more deeply affected by the
administrator than the legisla-
tor.” It was the welfare of
G.C. REMINGTON (as seen by artist Dubois).
the common man that he was
after. The public service was
one important road to his
goal.
A keen follower of Fabian
Society leaders Sidney
and Beatrice Webb, and, like
them, a firm believer in what
is now known as “the inevit-
ability of gradualism”—the
betterment of the people by
degrees—he has unrelentingly
bent his efforts to the success-
ful fulfilment of several
crusades.
Inevitably he has moved in
high places, becoming the
friend and confidant of Prime
Ministers, Premiers, Cabinet
Ministers and of many
eminent Australians who have
figured in the nation’s civil and
cultural life.
\ And yet to the public for
whom he has worked so well
Geoff Remington has remained
a shadowy figure—something
of what he has here been
dubbed: a sort of Pimpernel
of Our Public Life. He has
avoided publicity like the good
public-relations officer he was,
in effect, long before the term
became a household word in
this part of the world.
The start of one of his
crusades —his entry into public-
library affairs—would seem to
have been almost accidental,
but it’s something for which
Australians now have reason to
be grateful.
In Melbourne, back in 1935,
seeking assistance for the Aus-
tralian Institute of Political
Science, of which he was an
original board-member, he
called on Frank Tate, formerly
Director of Education in yic-
toria, president of the Aus-
tralian Council for Educational
Research, and the man on
whose advice the Carnegie Cor-
poration financed the Munn-
Pitt Survey (it dealt with the
arid wilderness which a tour
of so-called Australian libraries
revealed).
Tate said to Remington:
“You want to help poor
suffering humanity, do you?
Well, get your teeth into
this! ”
Handed a copy of the.report,
Remington studied it, lawyer-
fashion. It was a damning
report, calculated to stop even
a dedicated crusader. The
Australian Library Associa-
tion, which had formally
asked for it, certainly evinced
a positive reaction. It went
out of existence rather than
face up to it!
HTo Remington it was a
A challenge—an invitation to
have a crack at it.
He went barnstorming
around Melbourne, Sydney
and Brisbane. He rounded-up
the intelligentsia, inspired
businessmen with a desire to
give what support they could
to a project many of them
only vaguely understood. They
did know they were being
educated, made aware of their
citizen duties and of the exist-
ence of a social conscience.
And they liked it. All went
eagerly into action, fired by
the enthusiasm of the young
Sydney solicitor.
John Metcalfe, librarian of
the University of New South
Wales, recently said of him:
“He organised the Free
Library Movement. Reming-
ton, the layman, was the driv-
ing force, the genius of the
movement. I doubt if there
will ever be even a plaque to
Remington in the Public
Library of New South Wales,
but there are records more
enduring than bronze.”
Here is a little of what the
Free Library Movement
achieved:
Prior to 1939 there were
only two municipal public
libraries in N.S.W. —that-con-
ducted by the City of Sydney,
which was then known as the

POLITICAL POINTS
It is to be hoped the summit-conference
will be as brief and unanimous as that
of the Western leaders in Paris, This
took 50 minutes and decided to invite
Khrushchev to meet the Western heads
in the spring—possibly on April 25. But
the same day the three-Power nuclear-
conference in Geneva broke up because
it couldn’t agree on the means by which
underground nuclear-tests could be
detected. Also, while there was
unanimity about the summit-conference,
the Western Powers have a long way
to go to agree about Nato.

The Governor-General must feel
envious of politicians. At one function
last week, on a day on which he had

And didn’t appear to turn a hair!

If Labor’s incentive to getting Dr.

farewell to the Governor-General was
the kind of oration rarely heard from
Prime Ministers and almost never from

President Tito is engaged in a public-
relations war with the Soviet bloc, which
has been accusing him of being impli-
cated in the plot behind the 1956 Hun-
garian revolution “the dirty and
unscrupulous go-between act for the
murderous imperialist gangsters,” Mos-
cow says in its customary diplomatic
language.
Tito has threatened that if the Kremlin
continues to accuse him, and insists on
suppressing news of Yugoslav achieve-
ments, he will retaliate and publish all
documents concerned with the Yugoslav
role in the Hungarian affair —which inci-
dentally might make clear what happened
in connection with the murder of Premier
Nagy by the Reds. It is noticeable that
this threat has been followed by a sudden
silence in Moscow.

A royal commission under the chair-
manship of Sir Henry Willink, Master
of Magdalene College, Cambridge, is to
investigate relations between the U.K.
police and the public. Its two main terms
of reference are to consider means of
ensuring that complaints against the
police are effectively dealt with and to
consider police-pay in relation to the
need to attract recruits with proper
qualifications.
At the same time a committee headed
by a former Lord Chancellor, Lord
Symonds, is to make a thorough review
of “the right of certain professional
bodies to demand police evidence for
production before their disciplinary
tribunals.” This committee is a sequel
to complaints of “phone-tapping” by
police.
Revolution it’s wonderful when
allied to peaceful Russia. In Cuba, now
under Russian tutelage, the 557th execu-
tion of the dispossessed took place last

They are accused to having planned to
kill the Prime Minister, whom they
wounded. In Hungary executions con-

Poland has just put a Polish journalist,
with the traditional old Polish name of
Tomasz Atkins, in the jug for a year
and fined him £2500 for having evaded
£2500 in tax (which he must also pay).
He worked for the “New York Times”
and is the third employee of the press
to be lumbered under the taxation laws.
Mainly the charges affect income in the
shape of imports of goods to fill the
gaps in clothing-supplies which cannot
be purchased in Communist Poland.
THE INDIGNITY!


A self-styled “King of the World” has
been giving himself coronation cere-
monies in various Australian capitals
and says he intends to run for U.S.
President. Meanwhile the reigning U.S.

“Prince of Peace.”

Reg Ansett has denied the charge
made by Arthur Calwell that Ansett-

Ltd., which “would just not sell.”

Two sides of the picture: Soekarno
assured Menzies that he had no intention
of attempting to solve the West New
Guinea question by force. Now, in his
decree making himself absolute dictator
of Indonesia, he has said that “the whole

is in a state of war” and has warned
that “as long as West New Guinea is
still occupied by the imperialists the
sovereignty of the country continues to
be threatened.”

While organised labor in the United
States is in the throes of the steel-dispute
and engrossed, also, in aspects of the
1960 presidential campaign, the A.F.L.
and C. 1.0. are not neglecting wider
interests. The combined organisation is
now proposing to take a hospital-ship
out of mothballs and send it, manned by
A.F.L.-C.1.0. members, to South-east
Asia as a floating medical school and
centre. It will carry 800 hospital-beds,
together with a full staff of doctors,
nurses and technicians. This seems an
imaginative and worth-while project.
Nothing to compare with it, even on a
small scale, has ever come out of Aus-
tralian trade-unionism.

Spring Street still whispers that Bolte
will bring down a genuine, cash off-

other than credit betting. Probably Sir
Herbert Hyland will persuade the
Country party to have a conscience-free

The headmaster at Maitland (N.S.W.)
Boys’ High School (F. Hodge) has
spoken out against the activities of pro-
fessional coaches. He claims there is
callous exploitation of “anxious but
gullible parents” and that out-of-school
coaching is dangerous to students’
psychological wellbeing and undermines
their confidence in their regular teachers.
“Few boys need outside coaching and
fewer still respond to it.”
Coaching, even at primary-school level,
is now big business in Sydney, with
apparently plenty of money to spend
on TV- and radio-advertising. Mr.
Hodge’s remedy is the licensing of
coaches. A more effective move would
be for the Department of Education to
ban its teachers from accepting employ-
ment with these “coaching colleges.”

According to Tom Maltby, Victorian
Minister for Public Works, who is back
from looking over road-design in seven
countries, a four - level interchange in
Los Angeles was overloaded in five years
although it had been expected to last
for 30 years.
Californian designs now are based on
the estimated 1980 traffic-volume; in
England the Maidenhead by-pass was
designed on the basis of the 1954 traffic-
figures plus 220 per cent., and Canadians
are fixing a maximum of six lanes for
controlled-access highways.
Maltby wants Australian road-engi-
neers sent abroad often, on the reason-
able premise, apparently, that good trips
are cheaper than bad ones.

Queensland Deputy-Premier Morris

meeting which decided to go into the

ment would bear its share of positive
work to overcome unemployment, but

their part. Neither Governments nor

Most of South Australia suffers from
a shortage of water, but the south-eastern
portion contains a large area where the
problem is the reluctance of water to

land will be put into operation shortly.
Its main feature will be a drain 57 miles
long entering the sea at Beachport.

The building of the Aswan High Dam
will mean the submergence of an area
rich in archaeological treasures, and the
Egyptian Government, reversing its
previous policy towards foreign
archaeologists, is appealing through
Unesco for help in excavating, preserv-
ing and recording temples, statues,
steles and inscriptions in the 200-inile
strip of Nile valley between Aswan and
the Sudanese border. Egypt is prepared
to cede “at least half their finds” to
approved parties who undertake the
fask. It is estimated that only one-tenth
of Egypt’s antiquities have so far been
discovered, so a big response is expected.
Present schedule for the High Dam
leaves only eight years in which to dig up
the past. After that the whole area will
be under water.

“Ex-ACT”: Among the tributes to
R. G. Menzies expressed on December
10, the tenth anniversary of his return
to office, one of the most personally
pleasing to him must have been that in
an Adelaide newspaper by Francis
Villeneuve-Smith. This recalled the re-
markable performance of Menzies, who
a few years earlier had been “politically
lynched, drawn and quartered by a
hysterical and hate-filled mob, organised
and led by his own party and abetted
by the A.L.P.” Villeneuve-Smith said
that out of this chaos a “broken, lonely,
sensitive man” had emerged to become,
seven years later. Prime Minister for
the second time.
The eulogy did not deal with that
period in Menzies’ life from his
formation of the Liberal party in
1944 to election-day in 1949. When that
story is told fully it will increase the
admiration for the Prime Minister, and
explain in part the extraordinary and
not always acceptable dominance he
exercises over his followers.

Kim Beazley, Labor M.H.R. for Fre-
mantle, has been “disciplined” by the
W.A. executive of the A.L.P. for writing
to a Perth newspaper criticising the Mel-
bourne “peace” congress in a manner
“offensive to the decision reached by
the Federal executive of the A.L.P. on
the question.” Beazley’s letter said
that
the non-Communists at the Melbourne
peace conference assist the Australian
Communist party to pretend that it is
one of the free agencies of the Australian
people, freely accepted by other such
agencies, whereas it is, and must be by
definition, an instrument of Soviet foreign
policy.
Kim has been told that in future he
mustn’t make any press statement
opposing or challenging any question of
party-pblicy. His problem is that he is
intellectually honest and he has a
conscience—and consciences are out of
season with the A.L.P. executive.

Following a Canberra report that the
plans for a Melbourne jet-airport would
not be considered by Federal Cabinet
until a “comprehensive plan for
modernisation of key airports throughout
Australia has been completed,” Bolte is
making a personal appeal to Menzies to
speed-up approval for the one proposed
at Tullamarine.
Bolte says the coupling of Tullamarine
with an Australia-wide survey is just a
professional way of delaying things. By
“professional” he means, of course, the
civil service ; but if he can’t subdue
his own bureaucrats, what hope has he
against the powerful chiefs in the Can-
berra fastnesses?

“A.H.C.”: Mrs. Frances Sabina
Becke, who lately passed on in England,
outlived her husband, novelist and short-
story writer George Lewis (Louis) Becke,
by more than 46 years. English-born,
she came to Australia young and, after
marrying the roamer of the South Seas,
herself travelled considerably, living
variously in N.S.W., England, Fiji and
New Zealand. Herself a competent
writer, she assisted her husband and also
contributed extensively to numbers of
journals in different countries. Her
writings were mainly literary and
theatrical gossip, of the news-behind-the-
news type, derived from her association
with notabilities of the day—at one time
she ran a London bookshop for Conan
Doyle. Becke died in Sydney in 1913,
and about nine years ago his widow
returned to England, where she was still
writing very engagingly at past-80,
though now only in private letters. Two
daughters remain: Mrs. J. C. Hardy,
of Newport (Sydney), who used to be
an expert with a surfboard, and Miss
Niya Becke, once on the literary staff of

“Spinifex” introduces a cavalryman:
During the big shearers’ strike in Queens-
land away back in 1891 I was at Aramac
when a convoy of “free laborers” —the strikers
had a different name for them —came through
on their way to Bowen Downs. They and their
military escort halted for a meal, and, waiting
to get on the march again, the soldiers were
killing time stunting in the wide lane between
Thompson’s store and the Royal Hotel, with
the young subaltern in command showing-off
his horsemanship, dropping a handkerchief and
picking it up at a gallop.
With my elder brother, George, I walked
over to watch the performance. As we got
nearer George recognised the officer as an old
schoolmate and introduced me, though I didn’t
catch the name. They yarned away until the
convoy moved off again. Then I asked George:
“What did you call that cove? I couldn’t
get his name, but it sounded to me like
‘Shovel’.” George laughed and answered:
“That’s right; we always called him ‘Shovel’
at school, but his real name is Chauvel . . .
Harry Chauvel ... a nice bloke, but mad on
soldiering. Always was.”

teams of Clydesdales which used to draw
the Swan Brewery drays before motor-

served almost all his working-life with
the brewery and was its managing-

“Cremo” farewells a great sports-
man: —
Like his famous uncle the Jam Sahib of
Nawanigar, Kumar Shri Duleepsinhji was
statesman as well as cricketer. These two
Indian princes probably did more than anyone
else to consolidate the ties that bound India
to the British Empire. So it’s not beyond
imagination that “Ranji” coached his nephew
in the art of statecraft at the same time that
he taught him the importance of keeping a
straight bat. Duleep certainly played his part
as ambassador and diplomat, serving his country
well as High Commissioner in Australia. He
was always courteous and friendly, modest and
retiring—a true gentleman. It was typical of
him that when the N.S.W. Institute of Journa-
lists entertained him to a luncheon a few
years ago he was really embarrassed, stating
that he had not expected such an honor. A
fluent and sincere speaker, he told the gathering
on that occasion that he lived among his
people, who, all very poor, had to work from
daylight till dark to keep body and soul
together. Duleep did much to improve their
lot.
But it was as a cricketer that we all knew
him best. Inside eight or nine years he rose
to shed lustre on the king of games. Out-
standing in the history of cricket were his
score of 333 for his county and his scoring
two centuries in one match no less than three
times. As an outfield he was tops: exceptionally
fast, and with perhaps the speediest throw-in
of any contemporary fieldsman.
We saw too little of him as a cricketer in
Australia. His only playing visit was for
a few games with Harold Gilligan’s England
team, after their visit to New Zealand. His
Test average against Australia was 59.42 for
seven innings. Like his uncle, he was - a
stylist, second only to Archie Jackson and
L. C. H. Palairet, who —Englishmen said —
provided the “champagne of cricket.”
While this sketch of him was being
drawn Dr. C. E. Bean was lured into
giving an expert’s talk on the writing
of war-history—the importance of check-
ing and cross-checking every detail, the
surprising results that sometimes arise
from soldiers’ legend, and many other
points about his compilation and editor-
A WAR HISTORIAN
ship of the Official History of Australia
in the War of 1914-18. What he omitted
to describe, though, was the way he
succeeded in bringing warmth and
character into his work, making it
a model for war-historians throughout
the world. Even so, in yarning with him
the reason for this new approach of his
became perfectly clear—he is a man who
understands the general run of people,
and his work was never meant to be a
purely military document; rather, his
aim was to bring home to Australia
what the Ist A.I.F. had achieved. That
needed more than the dry-as-dust im-
personalities of a conventional war-
history. The story could best be told
in simple direct language, with a mini-
mum of technicalities, and he had all
the qualifications for that kind of job.
Charles Edwin Woodrow Bean (to
spell the familiar initials full out) was
born in 1879 at Bathurst (N.S.W.), where
his father was headmaster of All Saints’
College. He started his schooling there ;
then, when his father ieturned to
England for a while, he continued at
Brentwood School and Clifton College
(Eng.), and graduated at Oxford. Leaving
the Varsity, he became an assistant-master
at Brentwood in 1902 and at Sydney
Grammar in 1904; meanwhile, called
to the Bar at the Inner Temple, he was
admitted to the Bar of N.S.W. in 1904.
In 1908 Dr. Bean joined the staff of
the “Sydney Morning Herald,” becoming
their London rep. for 1911-13 and next
year a leader-writer. On the outbreak
of War I he was appointed Australian
official war-correspondent and was with
the A.I.F. for the whole of the war.
From 1919 to 1942 he held the post
of Australian official war-historian,
editing and producing his famous history.
In War II he was attached to the Depart-
ment of Information as liaison-officer
between the press and the Chiefs of Staff.
He became chairman of the Common-
wealth Archives Committee in 1946.

“D.”: Harry Giddy, who has passed
on in Melbourne at 72, was probably
the least known to the public of all
Australian newspaper chairmen. He was

to others, he had grown increasingly closer
to The Herald and Weekly Times, Ltd., and
to the Australian Newsprint Mills since he
succeeded Sir Keith Murdoch as chairman in
1952. He was Murdoch’s chief collaborator
in the mills, which now supply a third of
Australian newsprint, an admirable develop-
ment nationally, and he was immensely proud
of it and of the forests which supply it.
Until his illness he walked frequently through
the Tasmanian bush; his friends claimed he
knew each tree. He won his education and

ABORIGINALITIES
GROG IN THE BACK COUNTRY
[Sampled by Bill Howard]
A clause in most shearing-agreements
signed between boss and shearer
still provides for a £5O fine for “bringing
alcohol onto the property,” but anyone
trying to enforce it wouldn’t hold his
shearers for long.
Most sheep-barbers either drink one
or two bottles of beer between knocking-
off and going in to tea or slap a brace
of rums down. The last “run” of the
day is traditionally called “The Rum
Run.” Some go for the “brindabella” —
rum with a beer-chaser. They say you
achieve a quicker and less expensive
result.
Of course, there are men who don’t
carry grog—some for thrift, others be-
cause they either don’t like it or like
it too much. For most shearers, how-
ever, it’s a pleasant, yarning little let-
down period; for half-an-hour they
can forget struggling sheep, and it
sharpens the .old appetite.
You’ll find the odd character who
drinks his week’s dozen, or his bottle
of 0.p., in one night, is a cot-case next
day, and for the rest of the week will
bite his room-mate for part of his care-
fully-rationed supply.
The most heinous crime in the shear-
ing-shed—next to “scabbing”—is to
“bull” your room-mate’s rum after
surreptitiously swiping some. Most
shearers are also down on men who
“draw the crabs” through bringing
excessive grog to the huts.
Tt costs an appalling amount to drink
■*- in the back-country, especially that
of N.S.W. and Queensland. Publicans
too often regard shearing-time as an
open-season for charging ’way over their
zoned prices—ask for their zone-book
and you’re likely to be abused and even
threatened.
One pub in an outback N.S.W.
town is proud of being an A.W.U.
stronghold ; its shearer - customers are
free-spenders. The pub across the street
is still declared black by the local com-
mittee because it boarded non-striking
shearers during a “blue” about three
years ago. For the week’s supply of
grog taken back with them on Sunday
afternoons this union-stalwart Bung
socks the shearers Sabbath blackmarket
prices. The banned pub sticks to the
dinkum price.
/”\ne far-west shearing-contractor, aim-
ing to keep his team contented in
midsummer, carries in his truck two re-
frigerators filled with beer and rum.
Every night after work he issues two
bottles of beer to each man, or five
nips of rum, according to taste —and at
city prices, which go through the books.
One stipulation: No hoarding! It works
well.
M y own attempt to outwit the rapacity
XTJ - of back-country publicans had its
moments. “Guessing” at a two-months-
long shed, I arranged with Mum to
pack and post a bottle of rum each
week —it saved a quid and led to a
reasonable austerity,
But the money or temptation saved
wasn’t worth the anguish of seeing the
station-manager on Sunday mornings
up-end the crammed mailbag and, after
sorting the contents into “Shearers,”
“Homestead,” “Musterers,” or “Len-

Band that visited San Francisco for the

as guests in the Dinah Shore Show.
They brought home the trophy for the
best unit in the Festival Grand March.

migratory habits. The first of these has
been found 1500 miles away in Brisbane.
It had not been known that they migrated
from Tasmania to the mainland, and a
further interesting aspect is that this was
the time of year when the birds were
expected to settle-down and breed.

as my insurance-policy has a “tempest
clause” for which I pay an extra
premium. In the morning light 1 went
out to inspect. It couldn’t have looked
worse if a herd of elephants had spent
the night resting against it, but, marvel-
lous to relate, it still stood, in a sort
of a way, illustrating all the angles
known to Euclid. Gaps were numerous
and gave a fine view of the next-door
garden. Through one of these gaps I
conversed with my neighbor. “Well,

Trust the dinkum Aussie to select the
appropriate word for it. With fencing
at nearly £1 a foot “she” is likely to stay
in that healthy condition, and we have
the consolation of knowing that next
time the wind will go through it. Resis-
tance has been reduced to the minimum.
Did I say that perusal of the insurance-
policy disclosed that the cover does not
extend to fences or gates? I You can’t win.

“Roni”: Our N.Q. radio-announcer,
introducing the bush-ballad “Shearing

by “Duke” Tritton while on his travels
around N.S.W. Maybe he was misin-
formed, maybe it’s been modernised, but
when it came to the verse where the old
shearer mentions his grandsons return-
ing home from the sheds in Vanguards
and Holdens, I began to have me doubts.
How about it, “Duke”?

with them, Bill, and sleep it off,” and he
would. But Nugget’s missus thought it
was a bit over the odds when the big

“Pieter Nuyts”: Once again my daily,
in a piece of natural-history reporting,
has declared that the “echidna belongs
to the same species as the porcupine.”
Actually, the echidna is probably more
nearly related to the elephant than to
porky. For some time it wasn’t even
decided whether it could be classed as a
mammal or a reptile, or even as either,
and when they finally recognised that it
was midway between the two it was
placed with the platypus in the lowest
existing order of mammals, the Mono-
tremata. Curiously enough, although the
echidna and the platypus seem about as
far apart as it would be possible for two
animals to get, they’re the only existing
near-relatives of each other, and they’re
really very similar structurally.

“Liliydale”: In 1919, when the moun-
tain-ashes at Nayook (Vic.) stood like
candles in a packet, the s.-p. merchant
at Jones’s mill catered for the timber-
workers’ horsey predilictions on Satur-
day afternoons with some latitude about
bets lodged around starting-times. He
reasonably judged that no menace
lurked in the one local telephone at
Sharp’s mill, as its manager saw no
reason to wear his feet to the ankles
maintaining it so that Melbourne office
could harass him, and consequently it
rarely functioned. Anyway, Sharp’s mill
to Jones’s was a rugged quarter-hour’s
walk across the Pioneer Creek. A
modest trickle of successful bets lodged
at the death-knock had Mr. S.-P
mystified. In fact, Jim Murphy, in that
infancy-era of radio, had surreptitiously
got himself into step with the march of
science by medium of a cat-whiskered
wireless-set. Against all reasonable ex-
pectancy, blanketed by the Gippsland
Divide, he was harvesting an occasional
up-to-the-minute race-result. It might

choice, so I’ve watered, tended, cherished,
treasured it till, today, it flowered.” She
glared at the plant. “D’you know what
it is? Patterson’s Curse!”

“S.G.V.R.”: Remarkable ~ how few
old bushmen can describe the difference
between right-hand and left-hand shears!
In hand-shearing days a packet of six
marked “L.H.” was included in every
case, for the following reason: In order
to keep a fine edge on the tongs a right-
hander held them in his left hand, his
thumb erect under the bow to keep the
blades spread ; then he honed them with
a fine turkey-stone held in his right hand,
the bevel, of course, being on the com
venient side. A gammy-hander would
proceed similarly, but with the tools
in opposite hands, and to suit his con-
venience the bevel would be on the
other side of the blade, as in a pair of
ordinary scissors. Shearers, incidentally,
were very fussy in selecting their turkey-
stones, rejecting as faulty at least half in
a case containing a gross.

A ttention, please, Aboliar-dendrolo-

classifying Australian flora; is there
general agreement about the classifica-

Agriculture pamphlet I’ve seen boree

Does this mean they are the same tree,
and the apparent differences merely
regional? A lot of bushmen won’t agree
—but, then, a lot of bushmen still main-
tain that kangaroos are born in the
pouch. And how- —apart from the smell
—do you distinguish between the much-
argued-over gidyea, yarran and nelia,
and what is the range of each? —

wrapped the job up, including six made-
on-the-spot gates, in ten 8 a.m.-to-5 p.m.
sultry days! I was so nonplussed to
find the ramp and crush-passages only
26in. wide that I went and calipered
my favorite Hereford cow, whose beam
proved to be 32in. Jim, quite polite
about my concern, assured me that
claustrophobia just isn’t in bovine make-
up. So we introduced Chinchilla, of the
ample abdomen, to the holding-yard, and
she, as though relishing some lateral
massage, strolled into the narrow passage
complacently enjoying her rotundity
being temporarily remoulded to rect-
angularity. Now if the gates are open

“Duke” Tritton: The efforts of
“Norque’s” Bth Divvy cobber who col-

one essential. Termites, like bees, will
survive and multiply only if there is a
queen in the nest —a rule that applies
to all insects living in colonies. A queen-
termite is about an inch long and as thick
as a cigarette ; 'and, again like bees, there
is never more than one in each nest.

various mobs have come together under
one master-mind their tracks are easy
to follow ; but it’s a tough fence that
will stop them. Ordinary goats might go
any way at all. I know only one thing to
bring them home in a hurry: a pack of
dingoes. Sometimes, though, attacks by
sandflies will put them on the run.

that tree! ” “Aw Chris’ Marla [boss].
These plurry corsets. They’re hurting.”
She had retrieved an old pair from the
rubbish-dump for the occasion. Soon
Bessie emerged from behind the tree
minus the offending corsets and lined-up
with the others. “Go!” shouted the
starter. Thin, black legs thrashed away
and feminine shrieks rent the air.'
Spectators barracked hotly. “Oh, well,”
thought the young fellow when it was
all over, “better take old Bessie her
corsets.” In spite of the horse’s nervous
suspicion of the strange object he slung
them over its neck and rode up to the
finishing-line. Later he me( Bessie

How's this for a backyard of birds?
Not all at once, of course —that
would be something!
Birds, by the right, number!
Sparrow, present (always); dove,
ditto; bulbul, honeyeater, silvereye,
wren, native-canary, yellowbob, starling,
dollar-bird, kooka, finch, currawong,
crows (at a safe distance; with, but
not quite of, us), butcher-bird, leather-
head, thrush, parrots (Blue Mountain,
rosella), budgerigar (escapee?), and a
handsome green bloke too short-stayed
for positive identification. Peewee, pee-
wit, mudlark, magpie-lark (take your
pick of the names). One afternoon
briefly a pair of apricot kingfishers. Some
afternoons, too, a skein of commuting
duck, heavy with the Hallstrom hand-
out, homing to Centennial Park,
All this at built-up, arterial Woollahra,
Sydney.
A wagtail went on beautifully all night
once until imported competition got too
much for him . . . Occasionally chilling,
heart - stopping, the murder - bird or
screaming-woman-bird, once supposed the
powerful-owl, now expertise settled for
as the barking-owl. Radio’s sound-effect
boys would find it uphill to match the
first-heard horror of this bird’s shriek.
Almost forgot the most recent and
most unnative turn-up —an English
blackbird song - bird as ever was.
Welcome, brother, but you’re well off-
course up here. Melbourne has plenty
of you. What happened? Spirit drain
out of your compass? Okay . . .
But now, about that wagtail: This
chap owned a whacking great figtree
across the street and worked hard making
the night worth listening to. He day-
time visited now and then until a mob
of bulbuls muscled-in, a family-group
being put through the drill by the old-
’uns. First-class mimics, bulbuls. They
started in on Willie’s song, a couple of
notes for a couple of days ; then adding
a few more, practising like mad, so
that in something like a fortnight they
had “Sweet pretty creature” so damn'

HENRY (IXL) JONES
In The Bulletin of 20/5/’59
the £1 ord. shares of Henry
Jones Co-op. were suggested
for three-year holding when
they were at 555. Last week
they touched 83s.
On December 18, chairman
A. W. Palfreyman warned in-
vestors against “any anticipa-
tions of any benefits in the im-
mediately foreseeable future,”
and the shares weakened to
775. 6d. But they are still worth
sitting on for long-term
benefits.
Principal reason for the
strong upward spurt was the
disclosure, in the annual
accounts, of hitherto unex-
posed strength in the South
African subsidiary, the
stressing of the facts (noted in
previous published accounts)
that stocks throughout the
group are valued at consider-
ably below the figures accepted
by the taxation authorities, and
that overseas £s are taken into
the Australian accounts at par,
thus ignoring the 25 p.c.
exchange-premium between
U.K., N.Z. and South African
£s and Australian £s.
As regards the stock-
valuation, stock reserves were
sufficient, in the case of the
S. African subsidiary, to show
a surplus of £5A747,500. And
then, with total stocks of the
organisation in at £3,856,300
(up only £249,716), apparently
in the case of one or more
subsidiaries stock reserve
became rather too apparent,
through exceptional clearances
s t° c k, and overall eainings,
apart from the S. African
1 evaluation, were boosted as a
result.
The board points out that
“perhaps at the end of another
season we may have on hand
greater quantities of excess
stocks, in which case there
would probably be a down-
ward trend in our earnings.”
As it turns out, net earnings
from within the Common-
wealth were shown £102,502
higher at £382,700, and earn-
ings from outside Australia
£21,123 lower at £255,800.
Including exchange premiums
on dividends actually received
by th e parent, but ignoring
the premium on undistributed
profits, net disclosed profit for
t h e year was £122,908 higher at
£674,400, and equal to 27 p.c.
on capital,
The usual 10 p.c. dividend
called for only £248,500, and
reserves, including capital re-
serves, swelled to £7,035,000,
against paid capital of
£2,485,000.
With the idea of ultimately
allowing South African resi-
dents to become shareholders
in the S’African subsidiary, it
was decided to “reorganise the
capital-structure of the sub-
sidiary so that our total invest-
ment in that company could be
more realistically expressed in
terms of fixed capital.” In
addition to the stock-revalu-
ation of £5A747,500, which
was followed by payment of
a dividend of £SA7OO,OOO to
the parent (transferred direct
to reserves), the S. African sub-
sidiary made a bonus-issue of
£SA 1,300,000. These revalu-
ations and adjustments
have had no effect on the
profits for the year shown in
the consolidated accounts.
Although the capitalisation
made by the S. African sub-
sidiary came from consolidated
reserves, it has resulted in no
reduction in the reserves item
in the consolidated accounts,
although capital reserve in
those accounts now stands at
an additional £960,900.
From all of'which it would
appear that a very conservative
accounting policy has persisted
throughout the Henry Jones
organisation, at home and over-
seas, and that reserves shown
in the accounts at 575. a share
are very modestly stated, quite
apart from the 25 p.c. addition
that goes automaticall onto
S. African, N.Z. and U.K.
values. The same thing applies
equally to profit estimates.
Through its numerous sub-
sidiaries Henry Jones controls
over 20 large jam- and fruit-
canning factories, of which four
are in New Zealand, five in
South Africa and the remainder
in Australia. The group makes
cans, and the Tasmanian co.
is the largest exporter of fresh
fruit in Australia; it also
owns ships, timber-mills, box-
factories and orchards, and is
the sole distributor of carbide
in Australia.
There has been no bonus-
issue since 1927. The dividend
has been steady at 10 p.c. since
1936, except for 11| p.c. in
1939.
The Gyp-sum Group
A fter having touched 60s.
following the bonus-issue
of a few months ago, Aus-
tralian Gypsum £1 shares have
dropped to 50s. in Sydney, and
the scrip of Victor Electric
Plaster and Peninsula Plaster in
Melbourne has receded to 48s.
Each one of these cos. has
an equal proportionate interest
in Australian Gypsum Pro-
ducts Pty., and scrip in the
two Victorian concerns looks
particularly interesting at
current market levels. The
yield from the present 10 p.c.
div. is slightly more than 4
p.c., and on earnings claimed
by the group the return is 7.3
p.c. On earnings worked-back
from the tax-provision the
showing (to market price) is
8.5 p.c.
The gypsum industry in
Australia —a key one —is con-
trolled principally by this
group and the C.S.R. The
Australian Gypsum group has
extremely comfortable finances,
and its plant-capacity and effi-
ciency should soon be at a new
high level.

alternative offer of shares. It
is cash or nothing. The same
thing seems to apply to the
offer by Fisons.
Crosse and Blackwell became
associated with Mauri Bros,
and Thomson after the latter
co. had bought Raleigh Pre-
serving Co. and L. G. Thorne
and Co. Pty. C. and B. then
bought a half-interest in the
two cos. from Mauri Bros, with
the intention of jointly develop-
ing the local manufacture of
vinegar, canned and other
foodstuffs in Australia.
Crosse and Blackwell paid
Mauri’s in cash, there being
technical difficulties in the
way of payment in C. and B.
scrip.
Mauri Bros, has a broad and
spreading field in front of it,
and it has missed very few
opportunities for expansion
over the past 10 years.
After 8 p.c., 9 p.c. and
10 p.c. p.a. over the three
years following its last bonus-
issue, it is expected that
Mauri Bros, will pay 11 p.c.
this year, and that in the near
future there will be another
bonus-issue. Its shares have
recently mounted to 745., at
which figure the immediate
yield from an 11 p.c. div.
would be 2.9 p.c.
The activities of Mauri Bros.,
in addition to Crosse and
Blackwell lines, run to vine-
gar, malt, yeast, corks,
butchers’, brewers’ and bakers’
supplies, Crown-seals, stainless-
steel fabrication, refrigeration
equipment and numerous other
lines.
Kia-ora!
HThe sale, subject to ratifica-
* tion by shareholders, of the
food-and-cordial business of
Kia-ora Industries, Ltd., Mel-
bourne, to Campbell Soup Co.,
of Canada, for over a million,
culminates a long and profit-
able story of Australian inves-
tors’ participation in the busi-
ness which was founded at
Prahran (Vic.) by lohn Dixon
in 1906 and floated in 1909,
and which was based on a
piquant chilli-cordial known
as O.T.
John Dixon added fruit-
cordials to the co.’s lines under
the brand of Kia-ora. In 1914
the business spread to London.
Then in 1928 food-canning
commenced; in 1931-32 the
manufacture of paper-board
containers and food-cups
began. By 1945 food-canning
had become big business, and
a new factory was set-up at
Bendigo.
In 1951 the name was
changed from the terse 0.T.,
Ltd., to Kia-ora Industries,
Ltd., as by this time activities
had spread far beyond the
manufacture of this original —
in more ways than one-
product.
From the point of view of
those public shareholders who
put up their money in 1909,
the business has financed itself,
since 1913, apart from some
pref. money put in from time
to time and a small ord. issue
in 1951.
In 1929 the London business
was sold for no less than
£410,000 in cash —which was
equal to three times the
ordinary paid capital (£133,598)
of the co. at the time. The
co. then made its first bonus-
issue one-for-one to the
ords. In 1931 half the capital,
both ord. and pref., was
returned to shareholders in
cash.
In 1941 12,500 ords. were
issued to acquire control of
Australian Containers, Ltd.
Ten years later 53,902 ords.
were issued for cash, and in
the same term a one-for-one
bonus-issue was made both to
ord. and pref. shareholders,
the co. at the same time put-
ting-out £175,000 of new pref.
money.
In the past (1958-59) term the
co. announced a one-for-four
bonus-issue to celebrate the
public co.’s fiftieth anniversary.
Prior to this bonus-issue ord.
capital was £400,000, pref.
£200,000. At present the ord.
total is £520,000 in ss. units.
Sales for 1958-59 were
£3.7 million, tax-paid profits
£95,776, ord. div. p.c.
The sales of the food-and-
cordial section of the business
to Campbell Soups will bring
in something like £1,050,000,
subject to stock-valuation at
actual date of takeover.
Kio-ora Industries’ board
believes that it will be able to
pay p.c. from profits of its
container division alone, which
it should have no difficulty in
expanding with the funds corn-
ing from the sale to Camp-

Capital Inflow Indicates
Confidence
A.N.Z. BANK CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
“During the past year, Australia has proved the increasing maturity
and diversity of her industry by maintaining a high level of business
activity despite the effects of factors beyond her control. As a result,
growth and development have continued to be dominant features of
the economy” states the Hon. Sir Geoffrey C. Gibbs, K.C.M.G.,
chairman of A.N.Z. Bank, in the Bank’s Annual Report.
“There was a most gratifying
improvement in oversea trading,
particularly in the final quarter of
the financial year 1958-59. This
improvement was due to a group
of factors all of which were signi-
ficant ; the most important, of
course, was the considerable rise
in wool prices,” he continued.
“Perhaps the most encouraging
development, however, was the
inflow of capital from overseas
for direct investment in Aus-
tralian industry and for portfolio
investment in Australian securi-
ties.
“The expansion of investment
from overseas is evidence of the
growing confidence of investors in
Australia’s industrial future.
There is little doubt that this
confidence was assisted by the
maintenance of a high level of
economic activity, despite depres-
sed world commodity prices and
declining export earnings.
“Australia’s capacity to with-
stand a long period of declining
wool prices and an adverse
balance of payments, with rela-
tively little dislocation to the
general level of business activity,
is a matter for congratulation and
is evidence of the greater strength
which comes with the broaden-
ing of the economy,” states Sir
Geoffrey. “The industrial scene,
as reflected in the Bank’s Index
of Factory Production, shows the
sustained strength of Australia’s
national development. Sound
financial policies, coupled with a
firm faith and confidence in Aus-
tralia’s future, have, in spite of
a sharp decline in export earnings,
ensured continued industrial
expansion and a relatively high
level of economic activity.
“The development of a short-
term money market in Australia
is welcome evidence of the increas-
ing maturity of the Australian
financial system. It should have
an important part to play in
stimulating the provision of
capital for national purposes,
which is of such vital importance
in the rapidly developing Aus-
tralian economy.
“The success achieved in the
past year has engendered confi-
dence in the future. This confi-
dence is firmly based on popula-
tion increase, industrial expan-
sion, building activity and
development of national
resources,” he states. “Banks are
in a strong liquid position and
stand ready to play their part in
meeting the financial requirements
of further, well-balanced, national
development. With buoyant busi-
ness conditions in Australia and
encouraging prospects in export
markets, particularly for wool, the
outlook for the present year is
good.
“The general level of prices has
continued to move upwards, how-
ever, although at a somewhat
reduced rate in the past two years.
Recent increases in the level of
wages indicate a still further price
rise during the current financial
year, with consequent repercus-
sions upon the cost structure of
Australian industry.” Sir Geoffrey
concluded, “It is of the utmost
importance that cost increases
should be kept within bounds,
lest they jeopardise the export
prospects not only of manufactu-
ring industries, but of the great
rural industries as well.”

Gas-flows
[From L. Owen]
"Production of a measurable
flow of gas in Camden
10 bore —located about a mile
west of Camden 7—cannot be
described as unexpected, in
spite of disappointing results
at Camden 8 (five miles north)
and Camden 9 (H mile south-
east).
The report says that the gas
flowed about 500,000 cubic-
feet a day from 1741 ft. in sand-
stone at a recorded pressure
of 600 p.s.i. It is presumed
that the reported figures repre-
sent the initial rate of flow
and the initial pressure ; these,
normally, possess little signi-
ficance in comparison with the
rate of decline of both pressure
and volume.
That the pressure is some-
what higher than the shut-in
value of that recorded in
Camden 7 is encouraging, but
this fact should not be viewed
too optimistically as it is well
below the 900 p.s.i. which could
be expected at the depth
quoted, were the gas-reservoir
under hydraulic control (indica-
tive of permeability over long
distances).
It will be recalled that an
initial flow at the rate of about
2i-million cu.-ft./day was
“Then that brilliant gimmick, ‘Complete satisfaction
or twice your money back! '”
reported in Camden 7 on
March 18 from the depth of
1690 ft., but that this figure
dropped to about one million
after four hours. No further
production-figures appear to
have been published, but it is
obvious that there was a fur-
ther severe drop in both rate
of flow and pressure as, on
March 25, it was stated that
“when the well was shut-in....
the pressure rose to 200 p.s.i.
in 40 minutes.” The maximum
pressure published appears to
have been 415 p.s.i. on April
6, when it was stated to be
“still rising.” The pressure-
graph indicated a possible
maximum of 450 p.s.i. (B.
15/4/’59).
No analysis has been issued,
as yet, of the Camden 10 gas,
but it may be assumed that it
consists, predominantly, of
methane and that it is derived
from the Sydney Basin coal-
measures.
What suggests a different
origin is the analysis of gas
encountered in the Port Camp-
bell well, now drilling on the
south-west coast of Victoria,
near the S.A. border; this
analysis shows an ethane-
pentane range, but that does
not mean, of course, that it
will contain a sufficient per-
centage of liquefiable paraffins
(L.P.G.) to qualify as a “wet”
gas—as that term is employed
in the oil industry.
A “rough-and-ready test of
pressure at the surface” of the
flow encountered in the Port
Campbell well at 5657/5718ft.
indicated a heavy (estimated
at millions of cubic-feet per
day) flow of gas at a pressure
<sf 1600 p.s.i. It is not stated
whether this figure is the well-
head or assumed bottom-hole
value. If the reservoir is under
hydraulic control, the latter
figure should not fall far short
of 3000 p.s.i.
Both Camden and Port
Campbell are within easy
reach of industrial centres
where the gas could be
marketed on a commercial
scale, and, in both cases, data
from production-tests (includ-
ing graphs showing the varia-
tion on pressure and rate of
flow) will be awaited with con-
siderable interest.
Further afield, supplies of
“wet” gas (in quantities which
would be commercial if a
market were available at an
economical distance) have been
struck in Western Papua. The
annual report of the Australian
partner of the operating group
states:
Gas Prospects. The gas encoun-
tered in substantial quantities in
the Barikewa and Kuru wells
remains a potential asset.
Approaches have been made to
interested parties both in Australia
and overseas, and, while these are
purely exploratory, discussions are
continuing which may lead to
eventual exploitation of the gas
resources.
Fisheries Earn More
Tn 1958-59 Australian fish-
■*- eries showed an increase in
production over the previous
year and, though prices varied
between States, the aggregate
value of the produce was also
higher.
Australian fisheries’ produc-
tion for the year, excluding
pearlshell and whale-products,
totalled 118,000,0001 b. and was
valued at £10.9 million. Prawn-
production (6.8-million pounds)
showed the greatest relative
improvement this year, though
crayfish (26.3-million pounds)
and scale-fish (66.4-million
pounds) also showed significant
increases.
The different States still tend
to specialise in certain varieties
of seafoods. N.S.W. and
Queensland produce nearly all
the prawns ; N.S.W. also pro-
vides most of the farmed
oysters and Tasmania the
scallops. N.S.W. provided 42
per cent, of Australia’s total
haul of fish, while Western
Australia strengthened its posi-
tion as the chief crayfish-
producing State with a catch
(17.5-million pounds) equal to
two-thirds of the total. Vic-
toria was the only State which
did not show an increase in
the year’s catch, though in
N.S.W. and Queensland lower
prices resulted in smaller total
value. Queensland gained
greater relative value from its
oysters—output rose from
147,0001 b. to 407,0001 b., owing
to heavy harvests of sea-rock
oysters from ocean-beds north
of Rockhampton.
The indu s t r y’s general
increase is particularly satis-
factory because of the over-
seas demand for Australian
crayfish and prawns, and the
large import-bill for frozen,
dried and salted fish, which it
should now be possible to
reduce.

Borovansky
BoroVansky was sitting just
behind The Bulletin scribe
at the opening night of
his company’s current Sydney
season and was to be observed
—or, rather, heard at all
appropriate moments through-
out the night quietly but firmly
leading the applause for his
own production.
As well he might; for he left
nothing, not even the applause,
to chance; and, like all his
productions, “The Sleeping
Princess” was ballet of inter-
national standard.
At one time it looked as if
two of the older New Aus-
tralians from Melbourne, Boro-
vansky and his friend Ribush,
were going to lift the whole
Australian theatre to that level.
But Ribush, trained by Stanis-
lavsky, no less fine an artist,
had a certain indolence of
temperament which allowed
him only every five years or
so to emerge from his choco-
late-factory and his shooting
and fishing trips with Boro-
vansky to put some exquisitely
rehearsed play on the stage ;
and the same sort of sudden
heart-attack from which Boro-
vansky was to die took Ribush
off the scene just When in-
creased interest in the drama
might have given him his
opportunity.
So Borovansky’s achieve-
ment remains unique and
magnificent in the con-
temporary Australian theatre.
Starting from nothing—he was
starving in Europe after Pav-
lova died —he built-up a great
company in Australia ; rebuilt
it more than once when the
big-business necessities of the
theatre forced him to disband
it ; crashed right into the com-
mercial theatre and made a
success of it ; never lowered
his standards, and always could
be ranked with any company
you could see overseas.
It was the proper way to
build a living theatre: out of
one man’s fanatical devotion,
and that man a profoundly
sincere and talented artist. His
curtain-speech at his last first-
night was full of praise for
his team of Australian dancers,
and it is most earnestly to be
hoped that someone will arise
to keep his enterprise going
at the same high level.

Tatyana Nikolayeva
Last but very far from
being the least of this year’s
celebrities to appear under the
A.B.C. banner, the Russian
pianist began and ended her
only Sydney recital with a
toccata, a form which proved
as good a yardstick as any to
gauge both her technical and
interpretative equipment.
The opening one, Bach’s G
Major, was, as to the end sec-
tions, a model of crisply
nimble and translucent playing;
for the middle episode the
pianist dropped the tempo so
that at times it seemed as if
the tenuous thread of sound
must snap. But by this she
achieved a fine contrast for the
essentially introspective inter-
vention, with its undercurrents
of wistfulness.
The winding-up toccata was
the Prokofieff D Minor, a
pyrotechnical piece of tre-
mendous technical difficulties
through which she swept with
accuracy and elan.
The big work of the - night
was the Handel Variations of
Brahms—the finest example of
the form extant for the key-
board. After stating with the
simplest deliberation the
modest eight-bars-long tune
with its plain harmonisation,
Miss Nikolayeva went on to
shape the 25 intricate variations
with beautiful judgment and
taste, and always with the basic
thematic structure and the
initial harmonic treatment
clearly visible through the in-
tricate variation-patterns. But
best of all in this fine reading
was the light and shade she
was able to impart so sensi-
tively to the variations in the
minor key and, contrastingly,
the great thrust she gave to the
big major chords in the left
hand, where there was never
any suggestion of that “thick-
ness” and opaqueness which
can so easily mar the work.
The fugue which is the key-
stone that locks the great
musical arch roared gustily, as
it should, from beginning to
end.
For good measure there were
three of Scarlatti’s miniature
one-movement sonatas, includ-
ing the two most celebrated —
the D Minor and the C Major
—all played with serene assur-
ance ; Debussy’s “Suite —Pour
le piano,” delicately-wrought
images, shimmering and
sensuous; two of the nine
Etudes-Tableaux of Opus 39
by Rachmaninoff, glowing with
harmonic color and richly
romantic in execution ; and
the C Major Prelude from
Prokofieff’s op. 12, a moder-
ately showy piece of not much
weight.

Don Saunders does three
Grock acts, the biggest being

oils the keys, puts the oilcan
with the long spout on the

he may be as great a clown as
the publicity says, but up to
now his timing is not quite
always on the beat, though he
is about perfect with the big
accordion and the tiny little
accordion, and not too bad
with the one-string violin that
says “Mary Had a Little
Lamb.”
It would be hard to say
whether beautiful brunette Liv
Wilse of Scandinavia or
beautiful blonde Vikki Ham-

look at, and hard to say any-

justified in returning just to
do their acts with these two
girls, but that’s our bad luck ;
the Starr sisters did some well-
drilled harmonising ; in Ethel
Revnell’s act as a tall Brownie
on parade it was at least a
relief to see that the three little
Pippen sisters among the tiny-
tots Miss Revnell paraded
were a credit to Randwick. (It
has since been reported that
Miss Revnell has withdrawn
from the show.) Arthur Dun-
can’s medium singing and
brilliant tap-dancing went
nearer than any of the singing
or dancing to arousing
enthusiasm; and the lovely
young Tivoli ballet did their
best, as indeed such scantily-

Mary O’Hara
At the Assembly Hall, Mel-
bourne, Mary O’Hara goes
quietly to the centre of the
stage, to her small Irish harp.
Her movements have an
astonishing grace and subtle
assurance and the old hall has
suddenly become fresh and!
alert.
When the singer speaks you
are struck by the simple
purity of tone ; and when she
begins to sing there is no trace
of commercialism. The harp
is not a secondary accompani-
ment to the word, but an
integral part of the whole per-
formance, played exquisitely.
In fact you have never heard
anything quite like this before.
It will be hard indeed to
forget “The Gartan Mother’s
Lullaby,” “Dia Luain,” “Dia
Mairt,” “I Have a Bonnet
Trimmed with Blue,” “I Know
My Love,” “Lord Randall,”

Know Where I’m Going,”

‘The Ghost Train”
The programme-note accom-
panying this 1925-vintage
Arnold Ridley thriller produced
by Melbourne Union Repertory
Theatre invites us to view it
first and foremost as a period
piece. The present writer did
just that, and found it a pass-
ably entertaining evening of
spine-chilling fun —if such a
combination is possible.
Ridley is a master of his own
peculiar craft. Expertly he
plays off laughter against thrills
(usually of a supernatural
variety) while exploiting every
trick in the theatrical book to
make his audience alternatively
grasp their sides and the edge
of the seat. By the end the
Ghost Train has run right off
the rails into a no-man’s-land
of sheer corn, but there are
still plenty of laughs to spare
as the play’s unbearable fop
and practical joker Teddie
Deakin comes out in the wash
as a tough major in the
employ of the British Security
Service, and the hysterical Eng-
lish rose turns out to be no
less than an American gun-
doll working for the Bolshe-
viks.
The production by George
Ogilvie is competent, and he
has received some excellent
support from his cast (notably
Lewis Fiander, Dorothy Brad-
ley and Frederick Parslow),
most of whom have done well
to cope with their grossly over-
written and stereotyped parts.

Pictures in Perth
An exhibition at the Claude
Hotchin Gallery, Perth, dis-
played all the entries for the
annual Claude Hotchin prizes,
of £5O and £25, but many of
W.A.’s best artists failed to
enter, and barely a third of
the 157 pictures were worth
showing.
On the whole the water-
colors were better than the
oils. Cyril Lander won the
prize for this medium with his
lyrical “Rain in the Hills,”
which must have been closely
challenged by Leach Barker’s
dramatic “The Road Wound
Round” and Walter Terrell’s
“Conflict” a lovely wet
thunder-cloud rain-storm.
William Boissevain took the
oils prize with “Painting at
York,” a small sunlit pastoral.
Romola Clifton showed an
imaginative design called
“Tangled Forest,” and Bryant
McDiven’s “Flaminia” caught
the eye.
This show was immediately
followed by a loan exhibition
from private collections in aid
of Legacy and R.S.L. Veterans’
Homes' wherein were such
pleasant things as Norman
Lindsay’s “Nude in Sunlight,”
flower-studies by Buckmaster,
Violet Mclnnes and Herbert
Gallop, and the tiny “Clematis
Lane” by Tom Roberts.
At the Skinner Galleries,
Robert Juniper, who recently
won a continent-wide competi-
tion for murals for the new
A.B.C. building in Perth, is
exhibiting abstracts. His larger
paintings here would also make
effective murals, and red wafers
appeared with commendable
speed on a number of small
pictures.

Films
“Film Journal”
The 14th number of “Film
Journal” is a sort of coming-of-
age edition of Australia’s only
research-magazine on the
cinema. Edited by James
Merralls and Brian Davies, the
32-page issue, technically at
least, is streets ahead of its
predecessors.
There are about a dozen
articles, mainly analytical, and
a sobering editorial which
touches —as much in anger as
sorrow —on the swiftly chang-
ing face of the celluloid
industry throughout the world.
Cinema audiences, we are in-
formed, have shrunk by
half since 1949. The cinema
as “the medium of mass enter-
tainment.... is gone and will
never revive.”
Nine-tenths of new films
released are of “abysmal
quality.” Film societies are
having the devil’s own time
trying to secure “films for non-
theatrical use.” What’s more,
things will most certainly go
from bad to worse unless there
is a hurried easing of pro-
hibitive import-duty on im-
portant new films.
All the films discussed and
most of the correspondents are

“Operation Amsterdam”
The day after Hitler’s armies
struck at Holland in May, 1940,
Churchill became Britain’s
Prime Minister and swiftly got
cracking on a question of the
greatest import: how to beat
the Nazis to the rich store of
industrial diamonds in Amster-
dam. This Rank film on that
foundation makes a first-class
thriller.
A British major (Tony
Britton) and two Dutch
diamond-experts living in
England (Peter Finch and
Alexander Knox) set-out in a
British destroyer to get them.
They have just 14 hours to
accomplish their mission
and rendezvous with the
destroyer for the return. They
have not only to convince the
diamond-merchants of the
necessity to co-operate (the
Germans being sure to indulge
in reprisals when they find the
coffers empty), but they’ve got
to get the diamonds from time-
locked vaults the hard way, it
being a public holiday they
have selected. As well, Amster-
dam is swarming with German
agents and Dutch Army fifth-
columnists. It is furious action
almost all the way.
Eva Bartok, as a Dutch
patriot working with the
newly-formed “underground,”
brings decoration as well as
no little vigor to the role.
Finch, Knox and Britton
handle the tough masculine
stuff capably.

“House of the Seven
Hawks”
More Dutch diamonds.
Robert Taylor, adventurer
with a ketch, gets halfway
across the North Sea on a
commission to take a mysteri-
ous passenger to the Dutch
coast when he finds he has a
corpse on his hands. Then
he finds that the departed has
a rough map taped to his chest.
Whereupon a host of charac-
ters take pot-shots at the
adventurer, while he sleuths
both the murderer and the
cache of diamonds which the
invading Nazis had stacked
away for later recovery.
Taylor staccato-talks and
shoots his way out of tight

his indestructibility.

“Don't Give Up the Ship”
The scriptwriters of this
Jerry Lewis comedy enjoy
shooting at investigational
Senators, red-tape and—in one
very funny sequence—the
phony wrestling.
Lewis, who had been in
temporary command of a
destroyer-escort vessel imme-
diately after the war’s end, is
hauled away from his honey-
moon to explain why his ship
has been unaccountably lost
somewhere. That he has a
shapely ensign seconded to
him to assist his memory adds
zest to the proceedings. It is
Lewis close to his idiotic best.

“You’re on the
Buzzer "
By J. P. CARROLL
You had to get up at
3 a.m. to be here at
4 a.m. on this cold,
wintry morning. But
you don’t care because you’re
top-man on the shift. You’re
on the buzzer.
As you walk through the
shed to get to your locker you
take the long way round.
Under the brilliant shed-lights
you walk with an air of import-
ance and make a circle of each
of the three turntables. Here
some 60 locomotives stand
ready to invite your approval,
And why not?
As you’re on the buzzer, any
of these could be your loco,
The idea grips you and the
sounds of escaping steam,
shouting voices and clanging
fire-irons from the powerful
engines are, in fact, the very
pulse-beats of your anticipa-
tion.
An eminence donning his
robes could not have changed
into overalls this morning with
more dignity. But what of
your title? Who cares if the
outsider might underrate the
term “engine-cleaner.”
But you’re in the shed now.
Here the value of words is
different. For sure you’re an
engine-cleaner, but you’ve also
just passed the first half of the
“red book”; in truth you’re an
acting-fireman—this morning
you’re even something more:
you’re on the buzzer.
Now lined-up near the shed-
door you take your due place
of precedence with five other
engine-cleaners in seniority
order on your left.
“Look who’s on the buzzer,”
one of them cracks. “God!
Look at his boots, too.”
Self-consciously you do
remember giving your boots a
bit of extra treatment, but you
don’t intend to tolerate audacity
from a junior.
“Makes ’em no less harder
t o kick a backside with,” you
flj ng back,
“ Right . ohs rig ht-oh,” inter-
rupts old Dadda, the cleaner-
b as he addresses first the
• nior man
„„ , . „ ,
. Sfnd-jcey the boss says
s, ”P'y> tlle Junior shuffles
oft to fin en S ,ne sandboxes,
“Water-joey,” sends the next
*9 ra § a hose round the
circles of locos, to keep the
engine tender-tanks full.
“On the ashes,”- sets the
third-junior man in search of
a No. 10 shovel to clear the
ash-pits where the loco.-fires
are dropped,
The first three cleaners move-
off to their jobs with an air
of resignation. Their tasks are
expectedly the worst, as all
junior jobs are, but one day
they know they’ll work out of
them up the seniority line,
The fourth-junior man’s job
is always a surprise-packet,
He could draw a soda of a
job like assisting the lighter-
up, but then again it could be
a lousy, swinging job like
scrubbing out the boss’s office,
He looks expectantly at the
boss.
“Clean down the brick arch
in 840,” old Dadda says
blandly.
“What!” There’s no plain
resignation here, but frank
disgust. He knows he has to
squeeze inside the fire-box of
engine 840 to clean out the
dusty ashes lodged on the brick
arch. All he can do about
his ill-fortune is to purse his
lips and violently thrust both
thumbs up in the air behind
old Dadda’s back. As this is
the bloke who cheeked you in
the line-up you give him a
powerful grin.
“And to you, too!” He
gives you a full interpretation
and slinks away.
There are only two of you
left. Dadda writes out a
cleaning-docket.
“Do the bottom-round of
990. She’s on ‘B’ table.” Then
he looks at you. “Don’t forget
you’re on the buzzer.”
Forget! Not likely.
“Dut what does it mean?
Simply that all engine-
cleaners senior to you on yo.ur
shift have been booked-out
firing on locos. So if a fireman
goes off sick or fails to turn-
up the boss sounds an electric
buzzer —your summons to take-
over the absent fireman’s
place.
There’s a catch in it, though,
for there are shifts of engine-
cleaners signing-on every two
hours. So your availability
only lasts, on the buzzer, till
the next shift signs-on at
6 a.m.
Anyhow, there’s two hours
up your sleeve yet. Jimmy, the
second-senior man, and you
take the cleaning-docket to the
store. You draw cotton-waste
and kerosene then head off to
engine 990.
She’s an A2-class passenger
engine, and the fact you’re
cleaning her shows you have
got some standing in the place.
It’s the blokes on the buzzer
who do the engine-cleaning, so
you both set to work on the
bottom-round.
The bottom-round is an
hour’s work cleaning the
engine driving-wheels, connect-
ing-rods, motion-gear and
side-rods as well as the tender-
bogies. And there’s a certain
education about it all, too, as
you try to trick each other with
questions learnt in the engine
classroom.
“What’s the position of the
steam-valve on the other side?”
Jimmy asks smugly.
“What would you do if the
radius - rod broke?” you
counter whilst struggling with
his question.
Nine-ninety’s a good job. It
only wants a damp and a dry
wipe; not like some of the
old goods-engines which from
low-priority cleaning-attention
need scraping to move the dust-
impregnated oil and grease.
By twenty-past-four one side
of the engine is finished. You
look sideways at your mate
and tell him in a matter-of-
fact way:
“Won’t be long. Goin’ for
a hi-diddle-diddle.”
In a moment you are lean-
ing over the brass rail at the
engine-board which lists all
engines and trains for 24 hours.
There are quite a number
booked-up between 4 a.m. and
6 a.m., but your gaze hits three
in particular: mighty X-class
engines on the Bendigo and
Albury fast-goods, and an
A 2 on the early passenger to
Geelong. If only one of those
firemen would sleep-in!
All the time there are engine
crews checking-up on the
board. This is the nerve-centre
of the shed. On nearby
benches some crews are drink-
ing tea before their trips
begin. Others are checking
engine repair-cards at the
leading - mechanic’s window.
The shed foreman moves about
chatting and giving instruc-
tions. You hear drivers talk-
ing about “making a run for
Glenroy bank” or “chasing a
lost minute for 30 miles.”
Then a fireman brags about
the mileage he gets from a
single fire, and another swears
old 886 will get belted this
morning in return for the
flogging the old engine gave
him yesterday.
A great feeling of envy
swells inside you. That buzzer
could easily put you among
them. But you note that every
driver is paired by a fireman.
Then you see old Dadda
heading towards “B” table.
So you are suddenly back to

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
A. E. Goodwin, Ltd.
T>roducing two diesel-electric loco-
motives a week, when working to
full capacity, A. E. Goodwin hopes to
look after its shareholders mainly on
railways contracts. While concentrating
on N.S.W., the co. does not neglect
opportunities to expand its inter-State
markets, selling locomotives to both
Victoria and South Australia. Only last
week the second 900 h.p. “branch-
liner” left Enfield (N.S.W.) on its long
trip to Adelaide via Albury. On Good-
win’s books are orders for another 40
locomotives for N.S.W. Government
Railways and 10 for S.A.
The co. hopes to begin exporting its
diesel-electrics, sharing the overseas mar-
kets with American Locomotive Co.
(Alco), whose manufacturing licence it
holds. Alco also supplies Goodwin with
locomotive-engines and some other
equipment. The rest is produced locally.
Locos, are by no means Goodwin’s
sole interest, though. Established in 1926,
the co. manufactures a wide range of
heavy-engineering products, including
road - making machinery, gasholders,
floating-roof and other types of tankage,
cranes, powerhouse equipment, steel
ships and barges and rolling-stock.
Goodwin also builds coal - preparation
plants (washers, crushers, dryers, etc.),
and claims to have constructed about
half the coal-washeries in Australia. The
Bulletin recently visited the coal-
preparation plant at Coalcliff Colliery
and Goodwin’s locomotive - assembly
plant at Auburn, and was impressed by
both.
In addition, the co.’s sheet-metal
division produces domestic heaters,
freezer-units and hot-water services. The
range of domestic-appliances is growing.
In 1956 Goodwin’s acquired Hadfields
vSteel Works, Ltd. (Sydney-based engi-
neer and steel-founder), by an exchange
of scrip to a par value of approximately
£250,000. Two years ago the co. moved
into the Sunshine State, buying-out the
engineering and foundry business of
Scotts, of Ipswich.
The group holds 15 overseas manufac-
turing licences, including those from
Alco, McNally Pittsburg Manufacturing
Corp., Denver Equipment Co., Seaman-
Gunnison Corp. (all of U.S.A.), Meta-
ducts, Ltd., and Yarrow and Co., Ltd.
(of U.K.), and Rheinstahl Union and
Wibau G.m.b.H. Geinhausen (of W.
Germany).
Goodwin’s sales divisions operate
in all States and hold Australian
agencies for Hamworthy Engineering
Co., Tallent (Aycliffe), Ltd., and Tem-
perature, Ltd. (of U.K.), and Warner
Electric, Ltd., and Oil Metering and
Process Equipment Corp. (of U.S.A.).
Last year Goodwin joined with
Freighters, Ltd., to form Piggy-Back
(Australia) Pty., in which it holds a
50 p.c. interest. Similar ventures proved
successful in America and France. Under
an agreement with Piggy-Back Inter-
national the new Goodwin-Freighters
offspring is entitled to use all the overseas
methods and designs. The N.S.W.
Department of Railways has “been fully
co-operative in the proposals to date.”
An unsuccessful bid was made last
term to acquire British Standard
Machinery. The co. is “interested in
developing and broadening activities....
where desirable by the acquisition of
suitable organisations.” The takeover
glint is in Goodwin’s eye.
Last year’s output “reached record
levels in spite of production being
seriously affected by difficulties during
the period July to November, 1958, con-
nected with certain Australian-made
traction-motors used in its diesel-electric
locomotives.” Because of this a good
deal of tirrte was lost, especially at St.
Marys and Auburn plants. The co. is
at present engaged in legal action over
this matter.
Pre-tax profit for the year ended June
30. 1959, increased by £37,160 to
£304,969, after providing for all expenses,
including depreciation £49,445 (up
£6291) and amortisation of leasehold
properties £1538 (unchanged). Provi-
sion for taxation absorbed £102,810 (up
£15,260), leaving consolidated net profit
£21,900 higher at £202,159:

After satisfying the unchanged pref.-

ing was equal to 15.8 p.c. on the larger
average ord. capital employed, com-
pared with 15.2 p.c. and 14.1 p.c. in
the preceding two terms. The div.-rate
was increased by 2\ p.c. to p.c.,
absorbing £41,570 more at £157,980.
Reserves received £41,679, going up to
£845,171, subject to £50,386 intangibles
at June 30, 1959.
On December 12, 1958, the co. issued
1,214,101 ss. ords. at par, one for four,
including 150,000 to option-holders. The
new ss. shares were paid to 2s. 6d. each,
with the balance subject to call at mini-

net book-value of £773,678 (£1,082,724,
less £309,046 accumulated depreciation
write-offs). Visible capital - expenditure
amounted to £252,575. Goodwin financed
last year’s expansion from increased
capital.
At the time of release of last year’s
accounts “a revaluation of the properties
included in the co.’s recent acquisitions
is in process and this will be recorded
in the ensuing fiscal year.... reflecting
the asset position more realistically.”
Stocks and work-in-progress increased
by £160,347 to £2,851,225 and debtors
by £179,876 to £918,940, reflecting the
increased turnover. With more than
three-quarters of current assets tied-up
in stocks and work-in-progress, the true
liquidity position remains tight. In view
of the co.’s ambitious expansion pro-
gramme, further issues of scrip seem
likely.
The general impression is a favorable
one. A. E. Goodwin appears to be an
efficient and vigorous show, with good
growth prospects and diversified interests
safeguarding investments and earning-
capacity. The dividend increase is en-
couraging, although the reason for this
lift is not immediately apparent from


the disclosed figures on profits and re-
serves. The pace of growth is to a con-
siderable extent dependent on the rate
at which N.S.W. Government Railways
are converting to diesel-electric locos,
from the old coal-burners. In the long-
run the railways probably will com-
pletely scrap the steam-engines.
At the last sale in Sydney the ss. ords.
changed hands at 9s. 9d. each, yielding
6.4 p.c. on the basis of the 12| p.c. div.
The contribs. were quoted at 9s. Id. a
unit (paid to 2s. 6d.), while buyers offered
4s. for the ss. prefs.
Net tangible asset-backing worked out
at £ll ss. Id. a unit for the prefs. and

A.P.A. Holdings, Ltd.
■ji/TAiNLY a life-office, Australian Pro-
-*-*-*• vincial Assurance was established
in Sydney in 1912, and now writes life-
and accident-policies throughout the
Commonwealth and in New Zealand.
In May, 1957, A.P.A. Holdings was
formed to acquire the issued capitals of
A.P.A. Association (the principal operat-
ing subsidiary) and the new-born A.P.A.
Fire and General Insurance Co.
At September 30, 1959, A.P.A. Hold-
ings had a paid-up capital of 621,512
20s. f.-p. shares. At the same date it
held 351,110 20s. shares in the assurance
co., out of an issued total of 360,000.
This leaves a balance of 8890 shares,
or less than 3 p.c., some of the holders
of which cannot be traced.
The holdtng-co. declared a steady 24
p.c. dividend, but repayments on the
loan-stock (which is inseparable from
the scrip) continued to be the chief
source of shareholders’ income. Last
July shareholders received a payment
equal to 2s. for each assurance co.
share. Another 3s. is payable in Decem-
ber, 1959. These payments will reduce
the holding-co.’s debt by 13s. 6d.
an A.P.A. share acquired after the
reorganisation in 1957. When the take-
over is finally completed A.P.A. Holdings
will have a paid-up capital of £720,000.
During the last term two more sub-
sidiary cos. were registered. The First
Federal Discount Co. Pty. (incorporated
in Victoria) has a paid-up capital of
£lOO,OOO and is an authorised dealer on
the short-term money-market. The sub-
sidiary was set-up in association with
A. C. Goode, a Melbourne stockbroker.
The other subsidiary is A.P.A.
Nominees Pty., wholly owned by the
holding-co. The business of this new
fledgling is to act as trustee for share-
capital, debenture and note-issues, etc.
Two early activities of A.P.A. Nominees
Pty. include appointments as trustee by
“two large public cos. in Australia” for
their debenture and convertible note-
issues.
The volume of new business of A.P.A.
Association, Ltd. (the main revenue-
earner), for the year ended September
30, 1959, amounted to £3,946,584 gross
before deducting reassurances (up
£453,773). Excluding group term-
insurances, the amount written was
£3,909,084 (up £850,038 or about 27 p.c.).
Again excluding group term-business, the
average amount per policy written was
£1359, compared with £1309 in 1958 and
£1315 in 1957. Over 60 p.c. of new
business was written under whole-of-life
tables with an average policy of £1629.
At balance-date the total sums assured
in force (including bonus additions but
excluding reassurances) was £2,679,184
higher at £26,783,941.
Life department earned a £255,615
surplus for the year (up £69,565), from
which £185,426 was paid-out in bonuses
to policyholders (up £19,727). A trans-
fer of £lOO,OOO was made from life
department’s accumulated surplus to a
contingency reserve within the assurance
funds.
Premium income in the accident
department was £206,890 (up £13,450).
Claims amounted to £81,643 (40.5 p.c
of adjusted premiums, compared to
45.5 p.c. in 1959). Agency, management
and other expenses accounted for 43.6
p.c. of adjusted premiums (43.8 p.c. in
1958). Before arriving at a profit for
the year, £14,000 was credited to a
“special accident reserve.” This amount
approximated the difference between 40.5
p.c. (actual claim-rate) and the average
rate of 47.5 p.c. (adopted to eliminate
fluctuations). Surplus transferred to
p.-and-l. account was £1648 higher at
£17,799.
The following table shows the com-
bined results of the life and accident
departments (A.P.A. Association, Ltd.,

Total income from premiums and in-
terest was £177,988 higher at £1,555,079
(combined premium income was
£1,069,172). Claims were £63,919 higher
at £439,388. Expenses at £442,810 (in-
cluding £lOB,OOO divs. paid to share-
holders) rose by £60,938, leaving £672,881
to the reserves which now total
£8,016,556.
The net effective interest-rate on in-
vested funds once more advanced by
Is. 9d. per cent, from £4 19s. per cent, to
£5 os. 9d. p.c. p.a. The progressive
improvement over the past seven years
was £1 6s. 4d. p.c. (from £3 14s. sd.
p.c. to £5 os. 9d. p.c.) and was achieved
with a “strictly conservative” investment
policy. The surplus arising from this
margin is one of the principal sources
of bonuses to policyholders.
Assurances in force were again valued
on the net premium method with 3 p.c.
interest. Commissions and expenses
absorbed 26.9 p.c. of the premium in-
come, or 18.5 p.c. of the total income
(compared with 24.8 p.c. and 17.7 p.c.
respectively in the previous year).
Death-claims represented 77 p.c. of
the figure allowed for in the mortality
tables used (68 p.c. in 1958 and 67 p.c.
in 1957). Although this figure represents
a substantial rise, it still leaves a very
fair margin in favor of bonuses.
The investment portfolio remained
much the same as in the preceding terms.
Net tangible assets amounted to
£8,376,556 (up £672,881) and assurance
fund to £7,607,675 (up £728,366), includ-
ing £82,756 reserve for unexpired risks
and an undisclosed reserve for new
business expansion (£70,000 in the
previous term):

In its third complete year of under-
writing, A.P.A. Fire and General moved
ahead, collecting £1754 more net pre-
miums at £9194. Another £3571 came
in as interest, dividends and sundry in-
come. Reserve for unexpired risks in-
creased to £5133 (up £1380). Losses,
including provision for claims outstand-
ing, absorbed £4770, costs of manage-
ment and commissions £l9Ol and tax
£llll. Surplus was £136 higher at £3603.
With assurance and insurance steadily
gaining popularity and enjoying en-
couragement from taxation concessions
to the assured. A.P.A.’s organisation has
made remarkable progress over the last
decade. Assets increased by £5,365,000,
reserves and life-assurance funds by
£4,627,000, both than twice.
Sums assured and bonuses in force
went up by £15,470,000 (more than twice)
and total income by about three times.
These figures indicate an impressive per-
formance, even allowing for inflationary
trends which make closer comparisons
in real terms difficult.
An early increase in the rate of divs.
and loan-repayments seems unlikely, but
the holding co.’s scrip may be an in-
teresting proposition at its latest quote
of 675. for each 20s. ord.
David Syme and Co., Ltd.
Over the last two years David Syme
and Co., Ltd., publisher of Mel-
bourne’s authoritative and popular “The
Age,” has made remarkable publishing
and financial progress. This followed a
difficult period in 1956-57, when adver-
tising-space sales lagged, newsprint-costs
went up and earnings on ord. capital
dropped from 21.3 p.c. in 1954-55 to
6.9 p.c. in 1956-57 —cut to a third over
the two years.
Today, David Syme is well out of the
trough. Two years ago “The Argus,”
acknowledged competitor of “The Age,”
passed away, leaving behind a legacy

In making his address at the Annual Meeting of the T. & G. Mutual Life
Society, the Chairman, Mr. H. G. Brain, C.8.E., said that further healthy
progress was recorded in the Society’s operations. He also said:
“New Business written
was again a record in the
history of the Society.
48,941 Ordinary Depart-
ment policies were issued
with premiums of almost
£2,000,000 per annum.”
“Increased Bonuses. Over
£4,000,000 is available for
distribution to participating
policyholders in the form
of bonuses. This will pro-
vide for increases in the
annual bonus scales in both
the Ordinary and Industrial
Departments.”

“Superannuation and
Group Assuranee business
continues to show an in-
crease. Although people
may take certain risks with
income that is not required
for essentials, it is vital that
they should make provision
for superannuation and de-
pendants with maximum
security.”

not only of circulation and
advertising custom, but also of
higher distributing-costs which
now had to be borne by David
Syme’s organisation alone.
Results for the last term
indicate that “The Age” has
fully digested the large rise
in circulation -inherited in
1956-57. Subsidiary TV-busi-
ness, unprofitable a couple of
years ago, has been picking-up
lately, newsprint costs have
fallen. Most, important, the
demand for advertising-space
has been steadily and rapidly
growing. For the twelve
months ended June 30, 1959,
62,611 columns of ads. were
published—an increase of 4788
columns over the previous term.
“Satisfactory dividends”
were received during the year
from General Television Cor-

bourne’s GTV Channel 9) and
from 3AW Broadcasting Co.

“substantial interests.”

ART AND HOSPITAITY
In the grounds of Adelaide University.
Motif of the Festival.
Adelaide Gallery on North Terrace.
Music is intended to be
the main feature in
the Adelaide Festival
of Arts, to be held
March 12-26, 1960. Professor
John Bishop, who is the artistic
director, and chairman of the
music and drama committee,
says the music will be “excit-
ing, energetic and enthusiastic.”
But it is not officially
intended that the festival should
become mainly a carnival. The
aim is to keep the entertain-
ment on a high cultural level,
with the standards of the
Edinburgh Festival always in
view.
This is partly the result of
the influence of lan Hunter,
artistic director of the Edin-
burgh Festival, who spent four
weeks in Australia earlier this
year advising the Adelaide
organisers.
It seems to be regretted by
Professor Bishop that this first
Adelaide festival—the first of
its kind to be held in Aus-
tralia—will not be “lit-up by
really great world names,” be-
cause time was too short to
arrange for more than a few.
(In future festivals there will
be more time to make suitable
engagements.)
This international approach
to music, drama and the arts is
the thing which at once hits the
visitor from Sydney or Mel-
bourne. There is outwardly
no Moomba or Waratah motif
about this coming festival \
little special accent on any-
thing Australian or South Aus-
tralian. Emphasis is on the
world’s best that Adelaide is
able to get.
But among the lesser billings
there is to be quite a lot of
Australia on show. And there
are many “fringe” activities
surrounding the central cultural
core which, if they do not vie
with the official festival, will
undoubtedly supplement it.
TYuring the first week of the
carnival, on March 16,
Adelaide's annual Flower Day
will be held. This is always
an occasion for floral display
and celebration in Adelaide,
North Terrace strewn with
flowers, and spectacular dis-
plays throughout the city.
There will be a Floral Ball and
a street-carnival at night.
Other events will include a
torchlight procession and a
variety of open-air entertain-
ment, not all of which has yet
got into the programme. A
Festival Club, in a central
position, will be open to all
festival patrons, artists and
guests. It will provide meals,
refreshments, supper, dancing,
writing and other club facili-
ties. Application must be
made for membership.
It is likely, however, that
the visitor will find Adelaide,
as a whole, a sort of unofficial
but hospitable club during this
festival. It has the atmosphere,
the surroundings and the right
kind of people.
'T'he unofficial and independ-
ent leavening of the prin-
cipal festival features will, be
welcome to many ; to the more
dedicated music- and art-
lovers it may seem superflu-
ous. But to the visitor to
Adelaide the more that is
indigenous and characteristic
that the city has to offer at this
time, officially planned or
spontaneously (or com-
mercially) produced, the
greater is his range of interest
and enjoyment likely to be.
Every city has a character
of its own, and the visitor who
gets the chance of seeing right
into this character is the one
who most appreciates his stay.
There is evidence already
that there will be an enterpris-
ing commercial “fringe” as
well as municipal “fringe”; but
certain activities will no
doubt, in true Adelaide fashion,
continue to be “beyond the
fringe,” such as drinking in
bars after 6 p.m., or visiting
night-clubs. Often the visitor
finds that the night-spot which
he foxed-out on his previous
visit has now, alas, been closed
by the police. Such has been
the fate of one which still
flaunts its fading billboard:
“Entertainment! Excitement!
Thrills! Intrigue! Sh-h-h-h!”
A stimulating feature ot the
festival will be Professor
John Bishop conducting the
Australian Youth Orchestra.
Bishop is a vital force in the
whole festival, and an intel-
lectual, once met, to be
remembered. Slight of build,
classical in features, with silver
hair just so for a conductor,
he is right on the baton. He
was Dr. Malcolm Sargent’s
first pupil, and has been asso-
ciated with the Australian
Music Camps since 1947.
The festival will open in
Elder Park on Saturday,
March 12, 1960, with the land-
ing of the official party from
a craft on the river. The com-
bined Sydney Symphony and
Adelaide Symphony orchestras,
conducted by Henry Krips and
Nikolai Malko, will play in
the park. The second part of
the opening night’s programme
will include illuminated river-
pageantry and water-skiing,
music and dancing by the
river.
During the ensuing two
weeks the South Australian,
Sydney and Melbourne sym-
phony orchestras will play at
the Regent Theatre (where Sir
Donald Wolfit will also give his
dramatic recitals); the Aus-
tralian Youth Orchestra (under
Professor John Bishop) will
play at the Town Hall (where,
in addition, the Victorian
Symphony Orchestra, con-
ducted for the occasion by
Norman Chinner, will combine
with the Adelaide Philhar-
monic Choir) ; at the Elder Hall
there will be a number of
recitals, as well as a perform-
ance by the Elder Pianoforte
Quartet ; grand opera at the
Theatre Royal produced by
the Elizabethan Theatre Trust;
“Murder in the Cathedral” at
Bonython Hall; at the Union
Hall there will be a con-
temporary play. (About this
item, incidentally, there has
been considerable fumbling.)
At the Tivoli the Hogarth
Puppets will be a star attrac-
tion.
Recitals will be given by
the Janaceck String Quartet;
the Sydney Sinfonietta; the
Elder Pianoforte Quartet;
Gioconda de Vito (violin);
Philippe Entremont (piano);
Lois Marshall (soprano);
lames Whitehead (’cello) and
Lance Dossor (piano); Ladi-
slav Jasek (violin) and Clemens
Leske (piano); Mancel Kirby
(harpsichord).
A series of jazz-concerts is
being organised. At Elder
Park, also, it is intended to
arrange for a choir to sing
from the far bank of the river,
which could be impressive. At
the showground there will be a
tattoo and sports-meetings.
JVorth Terrace will be the
stage for many festival
activities. And here Adelaide
has something possessed by no
other city in Australia. The
Elder Hall, the Bonython Hall
and the University (Union)
Theatre are all around about
each other, with the Art
Gallery only a few yards
away. Between broad North
Terrace and the nearby
Torrens, from Government
House eastwards, most of the
cultural and higher educa-
tional activities of Adelaide
are centred.
The location of these halls,
galleries, libraries and the Uni-
versity, with the Torrens and
its gardens and parks just be-
hind, is rather like a European
university-town, even though
the flashing-on and -off of a
large BP sign at night throws
an intermittent light of com-
merce from the southern sky-
line of North Terrace.
Adelaide’s architecturally
appealing art-gallery is in a
pleasant setting on North
Terrace. The lighting and
layout are excellent, and it is
less like a museum or art-
morgue than most galleries.
The pictures are well displayed
—not overcrowded —and the
whole effect is at once appeal-
ing and entertaining. Adelaide,
too, has good, clear light.
For the festival there will be
five special art exhibitions:
Mexican art on loan from San
Francisco Museum of Art;
contemporary European paint-
ing, from Sydney, Melbourne
and Brisbane galleries; a
collection of sculpture from
the same ; and contemporary
Australian sculpture and
aboriginal bark-painting. C. P.
Mountford will lend his own
collection of bark-paintings
and aboriginal carvings from
Arnhem Land. The gallery’s
director hopes that C.P. will
be present himself.
It is believed that a collection
of Turner’s work will be
offered by the Tate Gallery.
There will be an architec-
tural exhibition, an exhibition
by the S.A. Society of Arts,
and of Hans Heysen’s privately
owned works at the Hahndorf
Gallery in the Adelaide Hills.
It seems unfortunate that
some arrangement wasn’t made
for the announcement and
exhibition of the Archibald
Prize-winner for 1960 at the
festival, together with the
Wynne prize.
“Murder in the Cathedral”
is, appropriately, to be staged
in the cathedral-like Bonython
Hall. Robert Speaight will be
making his second visit to
Australia in order to play the
leading role in T. S. Eliot’s
verse-play. He featured in the
play’s original performance at
the Canterbury Festival in
1935.
CJomething which should be
taken-in by the visitor to
Adelaide during the festival is
the Town Hall. Its drab,
weatherbeaten freestone ex-
terior belies the old-world
charm of its council-chamber,
its committee-room and, above
all, its Queen Adelaide Room,
where the Lady Mayoress has
her suite and where she enter-
tains. It is decorated in
Regency - period furnishings,
with contemporary paintings
of Queen Adelaide and
William IV. The different
paintings and pencil-drawings
of Queen Adelaide one en-
counters at once stimulate a
desire to seek a more intimate
knowledge of her life. What a
haunting face!
TThere is to be a Writers’
A Week—during the first
week of the festival. It will
coincide with the annual meet-
ing in Adelaide of the Com-
monwealth Literary Fund
advisory committee and with
the meeting of the Federal
Council of the Fellowship of
Australian Writers.
The A.F.A. itself is sponsor-
ing publication of Dr. T. T.
Reed’s biography of Henry

almost 3.9 times, leaving
288,752 for reserves. A small
loss (£1233) was made on the
sale of certain fixed assets,
reducing the reserves to
£965,073, subject to £150,000
intangibles (unchanged).
The continued rise in classi-
fied and display advertising,
and the general development
of David Syme’s business,
created a need for more floor-
space and for new technical
equipment, capable of pro-
ducing a paper with more than
64 pages. To meet these
requirements of growth the co.
recently installed a new five-
unit printing-press and ancil-
lary machinery. Another four
press-units will be installed in
the next three years.
By June last, the first stage
of building-operations was
completed. A deep basement
was built below the present
site to house the presses. Above
this level are six upper floors
of a steel-framed construction,
to which another five stories
are currently being added. The
older part of the present
Collins-street front will be
pulled down and rebuilt. In
addition, the co. has acquired
Age Chambers from David
Syme Estate’s trustees.
The new plant, and the
building programme, will be
financed in part by a seven-
year £400,000 unsecured loan
“negotiated with a certain
financial institution.”

holds increased by £152,557
and plant by £142,744 to a total
of £1,936,968. Visible capital-
expenditure during the year
amounted to £380,794. Stocks
dropped markedly by £242,600
to £373,918. Investments in
other cos. were £49,476 higher.
at £448,713.
Current ratio worked out at
almost 1.3 to 1, with the
theoretical working-capital at
£188,370 (up £53,843). Net
tangible asset-backing was
£5 16s. Bd. for the prefs. and
£1 18s. 9d. for the ords. (a
20s. unit each).
Last September, after ruling-
off the accounts for 1958-59,
David Syme revalued the co.’s
freehold property at Collins
Street, Melbourne, transfer-
ring the £141,440 surplus to a
freehold revaluation reserve.
To this was added another
£120,000 tucked-away in the
share-premium reserve. Share-
holders were then treated to
a one-for-four bonus-issue (on
October 30, 1959), capitalising
£250,000 of the reserves and
bringing paid ord. capital to
£1,250,000, now split-up into
ss. units.
No indication of any change
in the div.-rate was given. The
co. appears quite capable of
maintaining the present 10 p.c.
divs. on the enlarged capital.
Pref. shareholders received
a consolation prize when the
artich.:- were changed to
enable the payment of an extra
± p.c. for every 1 p.c. (except
a bonus-issue) in excess of an
8 p.c. div. declared on the
ords. Hdwever, pref. divs.
cannot rise by more than
l p.c. in any one year. Assum-
ing that this year’s ord. divs.
will remain at 10 p.c., the
5 p.c. prefs. would theoretically
receive a 6 p.c. div.
At the last sale in Mel-
bourne the ss. ords. were
quoted at 235. 9d. each, return-
ing 2.1 p.c. on the basis of a
10 p.c. div.-rate. The 20s.
prefs. last changed hands at
par.

From Herbert Holman
r T' , HE Leader of the Opposi-
A tion must be wondering
whether the.games worth the
candle He has tried so hard
to rally his party and lead it
toiwar .
Despite the overall defeat,
he personally came well out of
the elect,on. Stand,ng as un-
disputed head of the Labor
party, he took his beating
well and, before and after the
result, behaved in a statesman-
like way, winning a good deal
of admiration and sympathy,
This attitude is rational
enough. When a party has
lost three elections in succes-
sion (and seen its representa-
tion drop in four) it is time
for rethinking, time for the
captain to assert himself, and
time for the chastened faithful
to close the ranks. In similar
circumstances, the Tories would
have done just that, but they’re
not handicapped by a written
constitution.
For sixty years “the
common ownership of the
means of production, distribu-
tion and exchange” has been
the central aim and the heart
of the Socialist creed ; for
forty it has been embodied in
the constitution. Now Mr.
Gaitskell wants this hoary, out-
worn and embarrassing tenet to
be embalmed and honorably
ur j ed
. ‘ - ..
At the party conference i
was brave of him to try. But
the expected happened. The
Labor party only further ex-
posed its internal divisions and
rancorous personal clashes,
While its leader strives to go
forward the party drifts back-
wards.
Various commentators have
pointed out what Mr. Gaitskell
ought to have done « The
Times” said he missed the

ate unequivocally the view

calism made little impact on

.
Tough Assignment
The truth is that the constitu-
encies are fundamentalist and
that the diehards will bust
before they drop their convic-
tions. They are more worried
about losing their Socialist ban-
ners and stamping-grounds
thqn about the efficacy or
otherwise of “public owner-
ship,” which has become a mere
symbol, distinguishing a true
Socialist from a phony one.
(Already, the far Left is trying
to break Gaitskell by challeng-
ing him to come out into the
open and declare his enmity
towards capitalism.)
But, as the “New York
Times” shrewdly comments,
“in a democracy, a political
party either wins elections or
withers away.” Careerist is, per-
haps, a hard word, but there
are plenty of men in the Labor
party who have taken up
politics as a career and who
aren’t fussy about Keir Hardie
and all that. In any event, it
is they and not the tub-
thumpers who will occupy the
front bench. They can hardly
stand by and watch their pros-
pects dissipated by doctrinal
orgy. The trade-unions, too,
have a vested interest in
recovery.
On these middle-of-the-
roaders, Gaitskell’s influence
is strong. He will have their
very powerful backing when
the executive meets next month
to review the constitution. They
certainly want Gaitskell, and
none other, as party-leader. The
danger, from their point of
view, is that he might give up
the job in disgust for, though
tough, he is not thick-skinned.
Such action is, however, not
imminent because the next two
years are critical ones, but if
the Labor Party fails to correct
itself during that period, after-
wards may be too late to save
it from demoralisation and
decline.
Mixed Bag
The two latest box-office
successes could hardly be more
dissimilar. “The World of
Suzie Wong” (Prince of Wales’
Theatre), which established a
record in advance bookings for
a non-musical, is a spectacular
play with a “musical back-
ground” and is set in a Hong
Kong brothel. One under-
stands that it is about a prosti-
tute with a heart of gold and
an innocent who thinks he is
staying in a hotel; that it is
a simple, touching story for the
well-dined and unchoosy and
that certain expressions, appro-
priate to the setting though not
to polite conversation, add a
touch of sophistication. Com-
pelling, maybe, but phony, and
an experience gladly forgone
by this playgoer.
Seats are also unobtainable
at the Royal Court for Ibsen’s
very difficult “Rosmersholm.”
T his is understandable enough,
since there is a dearth of quality
plays and since Peggy Ashcroft
appears as Rebecca West. Miss
Ashcroft, surprisingly, has por-
trayed only two Ibsen heroines
in over thirty years on the stage
(the other was her memorable
Hedda Gabler in 1944) and has
not been seen in London for
over twelve months. Comment
must wait until the production
transfers to the West End in
January.
From Denmark to Germany.
Little more will be heard of
“A Man's Job” (Arts theatre),
by Ferdinand Bruckner, a refu-
gee from Nazi Germany who
died last year. The theme here
(purposeful courtesan bags
industrialist, gets rid of him,
takes over his business and
involves herself emotionally
with his sons) is promising but
is ruined by Teutonic over-
writing and gaunt melodrama.


Quiet Evening, with Interlude
By ADRIAN WINTLE
Paul was tired and vaguely
irritated. Not because he
was tired, but in spite of
it: he could be doing
things which didn’t cost any
money and which would be
more personally satisfying than
tramping through Sydney on a
cold Saturday evening in
corduroy-trousers displaying a
one-inch cigarette-burn high on
the thigh. But then, Estelle
would make him feel better:
this Latvian girl he had known
for two weeks and was going
to meet outside the Mercury
Hotel.
A neon sneered at the
excavations on the corner;
Paul waited as the tram
rattled past, then crossed dia-
gonally to the pub. ’ He pushed
open the door and looked in.
There were ghastly prints on
the wall. No one was there
except a shapeless barmaid
polishing glasses. He stepped
back into the street and looked
up to see how many stories
high the pub was.
And then Estelle came round
the corner.
Instantly he saw that she was
comparatively well-dressed: in
place of her customary skirt,
blouse and black-checked
horse-blanket scarf she was
wearing a tight-fitting black
suit set-off with a lime bow at
the neck —a bow at once daring
in its largeness and brilliance.
But she had her horse-blanket
scarf; it was wrapped around
her shoulders, partly obscuring
the lower reaches of the bow,
and lending severity to her
broad, high-cheekboned face.
The hair, as usual, was brushed
straight down in wisps onto
her forehead. Short, close-
cropped hair.
She took Paul’s hand and
leaned close to him, smiling
gently. Paul said “Dead on
time,” and she replied “Yes.”
(When she said “yes” she made
it sound like “yesh,” but it was
totally unaffected). Without
thinking, Paul led her into the
pub. They went round to a
little lounge at the back ; this
invariably reminded Paul of a
mortuary-room —it was cool
and tiled and quite impersonal.
She made straight for their
table in the corner and they
both sat down. Then Paul
remembered that you had to
go and get your own beer, and
he said “Want a beer?” Estelle
said, “I would like a stout” —
and as Paul moved away she
added “and see if you can
get Tooth’s ; you know?”
The shapeless woman said
“Yes, love?” and Paul said
“Got any Tooth’s stout?”
“No, love, sorry ; only got
Oatmeal.”
“That’ll do. One beer, one
stout, please.”
Paul allowed himself to look
at the prints. They were cheesy
country scenes in glossy color,
conspicuously “natural” and
carrying flowery pencil inscrip-
tions. They were rather like the
color-slides silly women said
they “would love to have on
their walls.”
The shapeless barmaid began
to wrap bottles. Paul said
suddenly “Sorry, not bottles ;
just glasses. Sorry.”
“All right, love.” She put
the bottles back in the locker
and drew a beer. Then she
poured out a stout. Paul paid
her and picked up the glasses.
Near the door he spilt some
beer; he swore gently as he
turned along the little corridor
to the mortuary-room.
Estelle was smoking. Paul
. put the glasses on the table
and sat down. Estelle pulled
Paul close and kissed him, then
drew away and smiled. She
pushed the packet of cigarettes
towards him.
Paul said “I like the bow.”
“Do you? You know, I got
it from a frock. I was ironing
it this afternoon and I left the
iron standing while I went to
the kitchen and when I got
back the iron had burnt a
hole in the material and I had
to trim it.”
She lifted the bow; the ends
were slightly ragged.
“It suits my hair.” She
giggled.
“Where do you want to
go?” said Paul.
She pouted. “With you.”
“Well, where?”
“And is he cross tonight, this
boy? He is cross with his
girl?”
Paul ruffled her hair. “No,
no. You think about it.”
He took one of her cigarettes.
''Three people came into the
A room: a very tiny girl
with long hair, aged perhaps
20; an ascetic student with a
thick, stupid face, dressed in
a cashmere jumper and grey
flannels; and a moon-faced,
not unattractive girl. The tiny
girl said “Hello, Estelle,” and
they all sat down over near
the wall.
As soon as it was decently
possible, Paul whispered “Who
are they?”
Estelle said “Students from
the Uni.”
Estelle had a funny way of
drawing on a cigarette: she
pulled a severe face, then
breathed the smoke out half
through her nose and mouth
with the same faintly bitter
expression. Paul watched her
as she drank stout. She caught
his stare, and smiled.
“Stout is good for you—it is
a healthy drink.” She drained
the glass and said “Do you
want to go?”
Paul didn’t answer ; he was
struggling to dispose of the
beer; but when he had finished
he smiled and stood up. Estelle
reached for her bag, put the
cigarettes in it; Paul walked
slowly outside. He turned, and
along the corridor he could see
Estelle talking to the students.
Presently she came out, and
they walked down the street
and around the corner. Paul
had his eye on Lando’s, on the
opposite side; masquerading
under the innocent title
“Espresso Bar” it was a favorite
haunt of students ; the claret
was cheap and the company
friendly. They crossed the road
and wandered in. Paul w'anted
to keep Estelle off the street;
she had the habit of drawing
him into deserted doorways
and kissing him.
Along the high counter
people were sitting on green
stools. Paul led Estelle to a


table not far from the entrance.
As they were sitting, he glanced
into the back part of the cafe.
Four people he knew. One
of them was Andrew. He
nodded.
When the plump Italian girl
came to their table Paul said
“One claret. What are you
having?”
Estelle thought. “I would like
what I had the other day—
cocktail, I think? Was it?”
The Italian girl rattled off a
name and smiled.
Estelle said “Yes, I think
that was the one.”
And then Andrew appeared.
You never referred to him as
Andy ; he was always Andrew.
Medium build, light, flowing
hair, aged 17 ; tonight he wore
his narrow navy-blue suit and
an old-fashioned dark-striped
shirt with a high white collar
and red tie. He smiled and
drew up a chair: “How are
you?”
Paul was glad Andrew was
there, because he w_as a veteran
of the unexpected, both in
conversation and behavior.
Once he had said that there
was an unknown world high
above Sydney ; a world of pent-
houses, where people lived as
normally as if they were at
ground-level. This had set Paul
thinking; he expanded the
thought until he imagined a
colony of creatures, half-
human, half-Marsmen, uncon-
cernedly living high above the
city, springing incredibly from
penthouse to penthouse with
the agility of cougars.
Andrew was talking to
Estelle and they were talking
about the art-school they used
to go to.
Andrew was saying “Once
it was funny as hell. I was
all dressed-up in a —what’s the
thing the Romans wore? Yes,
togas—a toga, it was really
sheets, anyway, I was in this
courtyard, and suddenly I saw
Estelle and I called ‘ Estelle ’
and bounded forward and
tripped in the folds and fell flat
on my face.” Estelle laughed :
“Paul, you should have seen
him! God, it was fonny!”
The drinks arrived ; Paul
paid ; the conversation flowed
more swiftly than wine.
Andrew described a book he
had been reading and made it
sound brilliant; he showed
them his cuff-links (“From the
Markets”), dull and bearing
someone else’s initials; he
accepted a drink from a New
Australian at the counter who
tried to tell him, in stumbling
language, that he was a
“museum-piece.”
But Paul could never be
entertained by Andrew all
evening ; he was too vivid and
variable. He looked at
Estelle: “Let’s go.”
Without a word she collected
her things and stood up.
Andrew said, “Where are
you off to?”
“Don’t know,” said Paul.
“The Cross, probably.”
“Might see you up there.
Look after yourself.”
/'Autside, it was cold. Paul
shivered and Estelle
snuggled close to him: “This
boy is cold.”
Wide, luminous eyes. Paul
laughed and kissed her.
He said “To the Cross?”
Estelle said “Yes, I think
so. But you must be home
early. You are tired.”
How right you are, thought
Paul. He hailed a taxi, and
presently they were swooping
up to the restless Cross ; 500
coffee-shops, 10,000 people.
The driver pulled-up in the lane
at the back of the pub. Paul
paid him ; they both got out
and walked along to the beer-
garden.
Paul usually enjoyed himself
here but tonight he didn’t feel
like much except sleep. It was
always full of people, this beer-
garden ; a strange mixture of
beats and bodgies. Not always
quiet and orderly ... as they
came in Paul noticed a com-
motion over to the left, and
a girl stumbled away from the
group with beer streaming off
her hair, face and shoulders.
“God,” said Estelle.
Paul approached a girl he’d
seen around. She was holding
a bottle of port. “Want some?”
she said ; then, “Hello, Estelle.”
“What’s going on?” said
Paul.
The girl—was her name
Barbara? —said “Oh, a bloody
silly bodgie flicking lighted
matches at some girls. One of
the matches caught on a girl’s
jumper and burnt a hole. So
the girl sloshed her beer at
him, but he ducked and one of
the other girls got a faceful.”
Barbara laughed. “Rather
funny, really.” She took a
mouthful from the bottle.
“How are you, Estelle?”
Esteile pursed her lips. “I
am well, I think, but I do not
want beer thrown onto me.”
She turned to Paul. “I think
we go, yes?”
Secretly, as they left, Paul
was glad. They strolled
down towards the bay, down
back-streets where modern
tenements rose proudly behind
terraced gardens; and now
there was the fresh smell of
the sea. They walked out onto
the deserted wharf and sat
down on the second step near
the water ; a dinghy rocked to
their left, making * a lapping,
contented sound. Far out
across the grey water, where in
the distance a red light bobbed
and winked, a ferry, all lit up,
moved slowly towards the
Heads.
Estelle spoke: “It’s a special
ferry, that one. It is full of
scientists. They know that a
bomb is going to fall on
Sydney, and they are leaving.”
Paul was cold, and looking
at the water didn’t help. He
looked instead at Estelle, and
they talked and laughed and
the water slid over the bottom
step.
Estelle said “We must come
and fish here one day. There
are fish here; I have seen
them.”
And another ferry sparkled
across the distant water, this
time moving towards the city.
“The scientists?” asked Paul.
“Yes,” said Estelle, “they
have forgotten their tooth-
paste.”
After a while they left the
wharf and walked slowly up
the hill. They went into a
coffee-shop and ordered tea and
chicken-sandwiches and Paul
felt tiredness dragging his eye-
lids down.
Estelle was concerned:
“Would you like a powder?”
Paul accepted the powder
and Estelle laughed when, as
he tilted his head and tried to
throw the powder into his
mouth, some of it scattered
on to his chin and collar. She
produced a handkerchief and
tenderly erased the pink grains.
Estelle took out her cigar-
ettes: “A nice place, this.”
Paul looked towards the
door. Outside, the roadway
sloped down steeply and he
knew that it led to the sea.
Inside, there was a sort of
balcony Elizabethan style,
maybe—suspended over the
entrance. There were tables
and chairs up there.
Two pots of tea and two
plates of sandwiches arrived,
and Estelle poured Paul’s cup.
“It’s a custom,” she said.
The tea was that special
sort obtainable only in cafes,
very hot but rather weak ; and
after Paul finished his cup he
felt his head nodding. He
loosed his tie and ate a chicken-
sandwich.
Estelle began to tell him,
in her cool, precise accents,
about her adventures in Mel-
bourne —the fur she bought on
time-payment (“It was so sleek,
you know, as if it was always
wet”) and which was stolen
from her in Sydney: “I would
not have cared if they had
taken all my other clothes, but
no, they take my bloody fur!”
Paul wondered idly what
time it was. He rubbed his
eyes and glanced at Estelle as
she drew on her cigarette.
That funny severe expression!
Later they were walking
slowly back to the Cross, and
Paul’s feet dragged.
He peered into a coffee-shop
and saw that it was 11.10 —
not as late as he thought it
might be.
And then, when they were in
the heart of the Cross, he
saw ahead of them a surging
crowd, overflowing the foot-
path ; people ran and pushed
and every so often a great,
baleful roar went up.
Tired as he was, Paul
couldn’t resist seeing what was
going on, so he hurried with
Estelle to the edge of the crowd.
He had to push his way through
and he was edging round on
the gutter side when Estelle
pinched his arm and said
“Look!”
There was fresh blood on
the bonnet of the green car,
and another roar went up from
the crowd; and now Paul
could see.
He couldn’t take his gaze
from one of the two: a very
thickset, almost pudgy man in
a dark pin-stripe suit, with
clumsy big red hands —his face
was shiny with blood. Blood
covered his face and darkened
his shirt. Blood spattered the
ground.
His assailant was a New Aus-
tralian in shorts ; a fair-haired
man of indeterminate age who
kept dancing forward and lead-
ing with his fists. Every time
he moved towards the swaying,
bloodied mountain the crowd
roared and pushed forward.
Paul was sickened by the
blood, but at the same time the
whole thing reminded him of
a ballet; a surreal ballet. Some-
one near the fighters turned
and said “Cops!” and the
crowd thinned a little.
Now the big man was leaning
drunkenly against a lamp-post;
the New Australian, shoulders
square, chest heaving rhythmi-
cally, strode through the crowd
and the back of his shorts
was sweaty.
What irony, thought Paul,
as two policemen bustled up
and led the bloodstained man
away.
But as quickly as the crowd
had overflowed the footpath,
so it dispersed, except for two
or three little groups who
reconstructed the affair. Life
went on ; people moved ; the
cafes, the shops, the neon-
lights were as bright as ever.
Estelle was silent, but she

Ranking of World Powers
Britain, U.N.A, and Rnssia
By FRANK STURGE HARTY
IN a report of the proceedings at the
recent “Peace Congress” a Mel-
bourne University Political Science
lecturer, Mr. Wolfsohn, mentioned
the impotence of the United Nations
to stop war. He went on to say, “The
Charter spoke of the sovereign equality
and/or a real measure of freedom for
self-determination of all its members....
In fact only two countries enjoyed
sovereign and/or a real measure of
freedom for self-determination —Russia
and the United States.... Other countries
like Rumania, Italy, and even the United
Kingdom enjoy a limited sovereignty.
In each case the sovereignty of the nation
is determined by its power—military,
economic and technological.”
The first part of the statement is
obviously true; it is the second part
I wish to question. In assessing the
relative strength of world Powers it
separates the United Kingdom from the
Commonwealth of Nations of which it
is “fit st among equals” and the con-
siderable colonial empire still under
British rule. Surely the recent observance
on Remembrance Day of the Common-
wealth’s sacrifice in the two World Wars
is a reminder that Britain, the Common-
wealth and Empire have to be assessed
as a unit in world Power-politics.
Grossly Inaccurate
there be any greater test of
their unity than those world wars
that so changed the political map of the
world, yet left the Commonwealth and
Empire intact? Why then this artificial
separation when assessing the relative
position of world Powers? It is mis-
leading and grossly inaccurate.
Let us examine the facts briefly in
order to determine realistically the
present ranking of world Powers. Atomic
warfare has transformed the whole mili-
tary situation and wiped out the advan-
tages hitherto held by the great land-
masses with enormous populations. Both
Russia and the United States are par-
ticularly vulnerable because of the con-
centration of targets, whereas the world-
wide distribution of the Commonwealth
and Empire gives a potential measure of
survival very much greater. Further-
more, Britain must by now possess
enough of the latest type of atomic
missiles to give her formidable power—
possibly quite enough to cripple Russia
if all we have been told of the appalling
effects of the hydrogen-bomb is true,
and Britain and the U.S.A. would be
allies in an atomic war.
A Changed Situation
Tn this atomic age the previous dis-
advantage of military power spread
over the whole globe now becomes an
asset of vital significance. The whole
military situation has been transformed
so radically that few people appear to
realise its significance. Even China’s
millions present a relatively concen-
trated target which to a considerable
extent cancels-out their previous menace
as a potentially overwhelming military
force.
An awareness of these facts explains
the calm acceptance of the scrapping of
the last British battleship and the aban-
donment of the Royal Navies of the
Commonwealth as their sure shield —
also the reduction of the armies and
air forces to relatively small dimensions.
The statesmen of the Commonwealth
have been the first to realise that to go
on building -up the impedimenta of
previous wars is merely to accumulate
useless junk and a dangerous waste of
manpower. It is very significant that
Britain is well in the lead with regard
to the development of atomic power for
industrial purposes.
Survival and Supremacy
it comes to economic and in-
** dustrial power, actual and poten-
tial, it is incredible that Mr. Wolfsohn
could rate the combined resources of
the U.K., the Commonwealth and
Empire as inferior to those of Russia
or the United States. London is still
the world’s financial centre. In tech-
nological genius anyone who forgets the
surprises of World War II with regard
to aircraft-design, radar and nuclear
fission is strangely lacking in realistic
thinking. In a sentence . . . the United
Kingdom and fellow - nations of the
Commonwealth have realised that the
struggle for survival and supremacy has
now been transferred from the military
to the economic and political fields.
Politically the British are the most
experienced people in the world and
have nothing to learn from Russia and
America. Mr. Wolfsohn, of course, was
merely echoing what appears to be a
widely held idea regarding the position
of Britain in this new age.
Meanwhile, Britain is losing no time
in speeding-up the rapid transformation
of groups of colonies, wherever possible,
into self-governing Dominions. It is in-
teresting to note how this British con-
structive programme has been manifested
in striking contrast to the destructive
and frightening Communist policy re-
vealed in the Hungarian massacres and
the rape of Tibet. Asia and Africa have
now had alarming evidence of the real
meaning of Communist “liberation.”
These continents will in future more and
more regard favorably the steady pro-
gress in wealth and freedom made by
the nations within the Commonwealth.
Distortion
Tf these facts are considered, then it
is obvious that to rate the United
Kingdom and the Commonwealth and
Empire as no longer having sovereign
equality with Russia and the United
States or possessing self-determination is
an amazing distortion of facts. It could
well be that a realistic assessment of the
position would rank Britain and her
Commonwealth as No. 1 Power.
The British are a patient and mature
people with a genius for compromise,
or perhaps it would be better to say a
political flexibility never before seen in
world history. Russia is tied to the
rigid dialectic of Karl Marx and the
United States is still confined within a
cast-iron Constitution nearly 200 years
old.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Sydney Horses
Two good-class races —the
£l5OO December Stakes (two-
year-olds ; six furlongs) and the
£2600 Summer Cup (H mile) —
highlight the A.J.C.’s meeting
at Randwick on Saturday
(Boxing Day). Chances seem
restricted in the Stakes, but the
Cup is more open, though on
latest form Gay Satin looks a
reasonably good thing. She
has won her last three races
in succession over one mile,
9 furlongs and the 10 furlongs
of her win last Saturday, when
she carried 7.11 (including a
71b. penalty) and defeated
Nadar Shah and Rin Tin in
the December Handicap at
headquarters. Now a five-
year-old, she has so far won
16 races at from six to 12
furlongs, and as she reverts to
the limit (7.4) in the Summer
Cup it’s hard to pick one to
down her, though Dual Copy
and Nadar Shah (also on the
limit) should both run well.
Dual Copy, especially, should
be suited by the extra couple
of furlongs. He was well
backed in the December
Handicap, but finished only
sixth. Horses weighted near
the minimum have a good win-
ning-record in the Summer
Cup.

Tattersall’s Club takes-over
on Monday, with the Carring-
ton Stakes the main feature
of the opening day of its
annual meeting. Its Cup will
be run on New Year’s Day.
The Carrington carries a
£1575 stake, and the best
sprinters in training were
nominated. Mandingos (1.9 j)
holds the Carrington record.
Backed from 5 to 1, to go
out a hot favorite at 9 to 4 in
the Villiers Stakes, Boorala ran
like a 50-to-l shot, at no stage
looking like winning. On the
other hand, the winner, Comte
De Paris, ran a grand race —
he was nearly last at the half-
mile, but was easily the best
home of the 15 starters. Tudor
House had every chance in
second place, as he was with
the lead a furlong from home,
while third placegetter Aka-
tarawa maintained his consist-
ency, though the company was
better than he defeated in the
S.T.C. International Stakes a
week earlier. Brisbane’s much-
boomed Repatriate (second
favorite) beat only a couple
home. Time, 1.35|, was a
race record. It was J. Thomp-
son’s third Villiers success ; he
scored on Filipino in 1948
and Barnsley in 1947.
• • • •
Australian Star’s two wins at
his only starts —at Rosehill
and Randwick —stamp him as
a classy two-year-old, but
Sydney racegoers are not likely
to see much more of the colt,
he being owned in America by
F. R. Rand, jnr., who paid
“Being Christmas Eve, boys, y ’ can fight friendly and
punch lightly .”
5000gns. for the Star Kingdom
(imp.) youngster at the Rand-
wick yearling-sales and a simi-
lar sum for Clem’s Son (yet to
race) and 4000gns. for Star
Glimpse. All three will shortly
be going to America. On Satur-
day Australian Star so domi-
nated betting for the Juvenile
Handicap that some fielders
didn’t bother with the race,
but concentrated on the Villiers
instead.
Randwick winner Minikin is
only a pony, but her brilliance
has now carried her to three
successive wins. In the Second
Two-year-old on Saturday she
wasn’t headed, apprentice C.
O’Neill’s allowance greatly
helping by taking 51b. off her
9st. burden. Raced by A. R.
Rial, she’s in the good hands
of Bill Kelso, who has her in
splendid shape.
• • • •
An apparently more-than-
useful type of English
thoroughbred was among the
Randwick winners North
Row, a five-year-old gelding
by Abraxas from Maid of
France, raced and trained at
Rosebery by E. T. O’Sullivan.
Drawn wide in the 10-furlongs
First Maiden, he looked to
have the job ahead of him at
the home-turn, but actually
had something in reserve at
the finish. Later in the after-
noon his stablemate Punching
Peter, also an importation,
started at long odds and beat
only a couple home in the
Welter, but he should soon
pick-up a race. The Welter
was nicely won by consistent
Winchester, who has landed
the money at his last four
starts, and at five of his last
six outings. Seven-pounds
apprentice Trenear, who had
the mount, can ride at less
than 7st., and Winchester had
so much dead weight—more
than 3st. —that stewards gave
permission to the stable fore-
man to do the unsaddling.
Under the usual rules the
jockey has this job, but this
was an occasion when the rules
were waived.
Winner of the Randwick
Second Maiden, High Row,
was catalogued at the 1958
auction, but wasn’t paraded.
He is by High Chancellor
(imp.) and was the first foal
of his dam Belle Tirage by
Faux Tirage (imp.). Leeholme
Stud, St. Marys (N.S.W.), sold
his half-sister (by Stokes) at the
last Randwick yearling-sales
for 160gns.
Showing sharp improvement
on any prior display, Pride’s
Castle ran away with the
A.J.C.’s Novice for three-year-
olds. A New Zealand-bred
gelding, he's from the T. J.
Smith stable, which also
supplied the runner-up, Cook’s
Tour, a Marco Polo gelding,
raced by Lady Luxton and
T. Luxton. Cook’s Tour looks
an early winner. Pride’s Castle
is by Castle Donnington (irfip.),
a son of Nearco, and is from
the Gold Nib (imp.) mare
Golden Legend, whose dam,
Great Memory, was sired by
Magnus (imp.).
• • • •
Representatives of Adolph
Basser and E. A. Haley won
the divisions of the Canterbury
Park midweek Maiden
Handicap. The Basser colors
were carried by Gaelic Prince,
a three-year-old Osborne
(imp.)-Saligna gelding trained
by M. McCarten, whose stable
is having a lucky run. Haley’s
winner was the N.Z.-bred
Grand Prix, a three-year-old
Khorassan (imp.) - Tamahere
gelding trained by Tom Smith.
He won his division easily.
Another good winner at the
meeting was owner-breeder
Jack Mandel’s Rose of Persia,
four-year-old daughter of
Persian Book (imp.) • and
Triestina (a Randwick winner).
Rose of Persia has the Carbine
blood in her make-up.
i}c * $
“P.0.M.C.”: Ken Austin
(passed on at Kaiapo, N.Z.,
at 78) owned his fair share
of winners, but he will best
be remembered by old-timers
as a first-class judge and seller
of them —at the Newmarket
sale yards at Randwick
(Sydney). Vigorous, courteous
and witty from the rostrum,
he knocked-down to buyers
many of the champions of


Australia’s golden age of rac-
ing, the 1920’5. Indeed, more
than one lucky owner of that
period gave Austin’s ready and
expert advice as sole reason
for buying their yearlings.
* * *
Doomben’s Inter national
Stakes, run at the weekend,
was won by 16-year-old
apprentice Doug Ferris on the
12-to-l chance Gulf Boy. He
beat Duchesne, ridden by
French jockey Fred Palmer,
with Japanese lad Y. Nohira
third on Torquar. English
jockey G. Lewis rode the dis-
appointing favorite, Bindana.
Later in the programme young
Ferris also scored on Appeal
Court in a Novice.

At. Moo nee Valley
For quite some time after
betting began on the first event
at Moonee Valley—the five-
furlongs Youthful Stakes for
two-year-old fillies —no rider
had been posted for Elated, but
there was a confident note
about the support for her. Then
the name of apprentice R.
Hill w r as semaphored against
Elated’s number, and punters
who had followed the stable
money were maybe wishing
they hadn’t, young Hill having
never ridden a metropolitan
winner. As it turned out, the
lad got his mount to the front
soon after barrier-rise and rode
a confident race to the line
without once surrendering the
lead. He is one of three
brothers, all jockeys. Elated
is an Orgoglio filly from Rar-
camba, and was bred by her
owner, Nagambie resident Mrs.
G. Johnson.
Trainer Fred Hoysted did
again at the Valley what he
has done so often before —
produced a two-year-old ready
to win at its first start. Hoy-
sted’s winner was Gay Invader,
who took the five-furlongs
Westbreen Handicap for two-
year-old colts and geldings. A
wonderful trainer with any
sort of horse, Hoysted is par-
ticularly good with the young
ones, educating them well be-
fore asking them to run in a
race. It was the veteran
trainer himself who bought
Gay Invader at the yearling-
sales, bidding to llOOgns. on
account of I. R. and R. S.
Dabscheck, who wanted the
youngster because I. R. Dabs-
check and his wife raced Gay
Queen, 1947 Newmarket
winner. Gay Queen is the
grand-dam of Gay Invader.
It really is extraordinary
how many horses win the same
race in successive years.
Svengali, who on Saturday
astounded most people by win-
ning the Fitzroy Welter at
33 to 1, won the same race
a year ago at 66 to 1, and in
between he hadn’t won any
kind of race, despite tries in
the weakest of city and coun-
try company. And on Satur-
day he defeated a Welter field
of very good quality. For his
pains, Svengali, instead of re-
tiring quietly to the paddock
—as he would have done if
defeated—will now be kept in
work!
The two heats of the mile
Parkville Handicap (three-
year-olds) gave a double to
trainer Phil Burke and jockey
Ron Hutchinson. The wins
showed that “Hutchy” (soon to
ride overseas) is equally cap-
able on a front-runner or a
stayer. Yurgama, a New
Zealand-bred gelding by Gold
Nib from Nizamdello, led
practically throughout the first
heat, and Hutchinson allowed
him to make his own com-
fortable pace. By contrast,
Lady Napoli, who took the
second Parkville, put in a sus-
tained run from a rearward
position at the half-mile to
snatch the race from Smoke
Mist, who had looked a sure
winner 50yds. from the line.
Lady Napoli is a filly out of
Brise D’Amour by Neapolitan
(same sire had been repre-
sented earlier in the day by
Gay Invader). Third place-
getter behind Lady Napoli,
Vallo, is also a Neapolitan.
Prior to her win in the
Carlton Handicap (6 furlongs
less 20yds.) there was not much
to enthuse about in the record
of Chavey Nights. She had
won two or three provincial
and country events, but she had
not shown the form required
to beat a field of fair-class city
sprinters. However, her
trainer, Geelong mentor Fred
Laherty, believes she is a
better-than-average sprinter,
and has plans to start her in
the Oakleigh Plate next
autumn. Laherty is a part-
owner with E. Maher; they
secured her very cheaply as a
yearling—l2ogns.
First thoughts were best —
but only just—for punters in
the other division of the
Carlton.
Arcadian was opening
favorite, but the five-year-old
High Peak gelding drifted
following confident support for
Grandor. These two had the
finish to themselves and went
across the line so close together
that not even the. book-
makers were prepared to say
which had won. With the aid
of the camera, the judge gave
the decision to Arcadian by
the shortest margin in his
book —a short half-head.
Trained by Flemington mentor
R. Roach, who races the geld-
ing in partnership with his wife,
Aracadian does not win many
races, but he can handle the
tricky Valley track, where he
scored his most recent success
last March.
* * *
Trots
Thanks to the splendid
driving of F. W. Wilkins, the
certainly well-named aged
pacer Doyen, landed the
Harold Park Handicap last
Friday night, beating Firma-
ment and Sir Raider. With a
lap to go Doyen was boxed-in
on the rails, about sixth, but
Wilkins got him out a couple
of furlongs from home, gradu-
ally overtook the leaders and
landed the bacon or Christmas
ham by three-quarters of a
length. Recently Doyen was
up for sale, but he’s now an
Inter-Dominion prospect. Sir
Raider, a neck behind Firma-
ment, ran a sterling race from
the 36yds.-mark. Bill Hansell
was cheered, though for
another reason, when he drove
Dark Silver to victory in the
First Qualifying Stakes. Al-
though he has driven 30
winners on provincial tracks,
this was his first at the Park.
W. Wilmott drove Sonatol to
an easy victory in the Trotters’
Handicap, and completed the
double with Empanage in the
Second Qualifying. In the
Trotters’ race Sonatol and the
second horse, Humility, paid a
quinella dividend of £2ll.
Winner at his only previous
Harold Park appearance,
favorite Gay Vivienne broke
badly at the start, but finished
a very close third.

Test and Shield
Except during the century
opening-partnership by Roy
and Contractor in its second
innings, India proved no
match for Australia in the first
cricket Test in New Delhi, and
was beaten by an innings and
127. India, 135 and 206; Aus-
tralia, 468.
India crashed for a first-innings

batsmen, Roy and Umrigar, for
ducks, and having 2-0 at that stage.
At the other end of the innings
Benaud bagged 3-0.
India started its second innings
333 runs behind, but began very
well, with an opening stand of
131 (Roy 99, Contractor 34).
Contractor top-scored in the first
innings with 41. When they went

India. Fie made his first against
Amarnath’s tourists in Australia in
1947-48, at the outset of his Test
career, and his second in India
in J 956. He has now passed 5000
runs in Tests (5031), at an average
of 52. Only Bradman (6996,
average 99) has made more runs in
Tests for Australia.
W.A. had N.S.W. on the wrong
foot almost from the first ball in
their Shield match in Perth, win-
ning outright by an innings and
105 runs. W.A., 4-487; N.S.W.,
172 and 210. Stars were W.A.
opener Simpson and skipper
Meuleman, and N.S.W. all-rounder
Flockton, recalled to the side for
the first time since 1953-54.
Simpson—in great form after
playing the last English season in
the Lancashire League and then
having a few games with Compton’s
team in South Africa —made 236
not-out. Meuleman waited before
closing until Simpson had passed
his own 234 not-out against S.A.
in Perth in 1956-57, the previous
highest score by a W.A. batsman.
Meuleman himself was 153 not-
out. He’s been an invaluable bats-
man for W.A.; almost always gets
at least one very big score each
season —180 not-out, for instance,
his best last season.
Simpson completed a great
match by taking 5-45 in N.S.W.’s
second innings. For N.S.W.
(winners of the Shield for the past
six seasons) Flockton played two
good knocks —60 and 76 not-out.
In the match in Perth at the
end of last season N.S.W. made
417, and dismissed W.A. for 107
and 207, winning with almost the
same tally as W.A.’s this year—
an innings and 103.
On an M.C.G. pitch good for a
thousand runs Queensland made
the fair-only total of 203. Never-
theless, it was almost too much
for the batsmen-packed Victorian
side, who were soon scratching for
runs and just struggled past the
post, mainly through the 87 not-
out of the slow but sure Shaw.
The game petered-out then, with
Reynolds and McLaughlin making
slow second-innings centuries for
Queensland. Q., 203 and 4-285;
Vic., 8-204 and 5-172.

“Haddo”: Country Rugby
League clubs are in bother
over engagement of coaches
for the 1960 season. In the
past most coaches came from
Sydney clubs, but the small
number of players placed on
the transfer-list has almost
eliminated the opportunity to
obtain suitable talent. Some
clubs had signed-up coaches
from the city before the
transfer-lists were published.
An outstanding case was the
engagement of North Sydney’s
Honeysett by the Young club.
Honeysett is not on the list,
and there appears little chance
of Norths releasing last
season’s captain.

Sedgman-McGregor, who won
the Australian, French,
Wimbledon and U.S. doubles
—the “grand slam.” Sedgman
and McGregor, the only pair
to win the four (in 1951),
almost made a repeat the fol-
lowing year. They were
stopped only in the U.S.
doubles, when Mervyn Rose
and Vic Seixas, a scratch pair,
won the title. Fraser and
Emerson start their campaign
with the Australian doubles
championship in Brisbane .next

“Athlete”: In 1958 Olympic
sprint champion Betty Cuthbert
was consistently withdrawn
from regular competition, and
an under-conditioned Miss
Cuthbert was beaten soundly
at the Empire Games in Car-
diff. This season she is getting
so much “work” that she may
feel the strain ; she races and
competes in field-game events
every weekend. Also she has
changed her starting-position
and is striving to eliminate the
“roughness” of her arm-action
in the middle stages of a race.
It may be recalled that in 1956
Marlene Mathews changed her
starting-position before the
Olympic Games with disastrous
effects.


UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
SPUTNIKS AND SAUSAGES
■CARLY this month, in a speech
to workers in an auto-
mobile factory at Lvov, in the
western Ukraine, Khrushchev
spoke of the progress, of the
Soviet drive for greater pro-
duction of consumer-goods.
He admitted that, owing to
drought, the agricultural pro-
gramme had gone “a bit awry”
—9,642,800 tons below
schedule —but said that indus-
try was “overfilling plans” and
it seemed that the Seven-year
Plan would be implemented
well ahead of time. More
consumer-goods were being
produced and their quality had
improved.
In an article in the December
issue of “The World Today”
O. Pick and A. Wiseman
reviewed Soviet progress in this
respect, taking as their text
Khrushchev’s crack when,
visiting a meat-packing plant
in lowa, he said that although
Russia was ahead of the U.S.
in space-exploration America
was leading in the production
of sausages, “but the Soviet
Union will soon catch-up in
that, too”:
“The Soviet Premier has
never made a secret of his
determination to improve the
lot of the average Soviet
citizen, nor of his belief that
the U.S.S.R. will outstrip the
U.S.A. in wealth and riches.
This may not happen as soon
as he claims, but it cannot be
denied that Soviet living stan-
dards have been gradually
rising in recent years and that
the current Seven-year Plan,
even if underfulfilled, will
bring the Soviet citizen some-
what nearer to the levels
enjoyed by America and
Western Europe.
“As far as food —the prime
consumer-requirement—is con-
cerned, the position is much
improved. Soviet statisticians
and Western observers agree
that shortages of basic foods
are a thing of the past. Prices
are still high, but no one in
the U.S.S.R. need go hungry,
even if after paying for food
little is left for other purchases
.... Manufactured consumer-
goods are the main problem
today.
“The most recent reaffirma-
tion of Soviet intentions to
increase output of durable
consumer - goods and to
improve their variety and
quality was in the form of a
resolution by the C.P.S.U.
Central Committee and the
U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers.
This admitted that the produc-
tion of many consumer-goods
was not keeping pace with
demand, and gave a detailed
list of goods in short supply,
including TV-sets, pianos,
washing- and sewing-machines,
refrigerators, electric - irons,
crockery, glass- and enamel-
ware, and hardware.
“According to the resolu-
tion, the design and technical
efficiency of household
appliances stood in need of
considerable improvement.
The Party and Government
propose to meet this situation
by introducing new machinery,
improving production tech-
niques, and reducing costs.
The resolution laid down
targets for the production of
some consumer-goods of which
there is a particular shortage.
The aim is to increase, by 1961,
the annual output of refrigera-
tors to 796,000 (360,000 in
1958), of TV-sets to 1,926,000
(979,300 in 1958), washing-
machines to 1,215,000 (463,000
in 1958), sewing-machines to
3,470,000 (2,685,600 in 1958),
and children’s bicycles to
1,565,000 (1,024,300 in 1958).
“The Central Committee
and the Council of Ministers
were not content to draw-up
general instructions on manu-
facture and distribution, but
also urged the relevant authori-
ties to produce less cumber-
some and more efficient auto-
matic washing-machines, radio-
and TV-sets capable of being
tuned properly, ‘clocks com-
bined with a barometer, ther-
mometer, and calendar . . .
wall- and table-clocks with
chimes . . . galvanised bed-
steads . . . plastic lamp-
shades . . .’ No more silk lamp-
shades are to be made in
Russia. The resolution insists
that in future factory manage-
ments must seek permission
from their Republican Council
of Ministers if they wish to
discontinue production of any
kind of consumer-goods.
“This most recent attempt
to provide better and more
durable consumer-goods fits
into the framework of the
current Seven - year Plan
(1959-65). It appears, however,
to concentrate on improving
quality rather than on a
drastic quantitative increase
over and above the Plan
targets. This is borne out
by recent Soviet press and
—London "Daily Express.”
"IT’S NOT THE JOURNEY I MIND. IT’S THOSE AWKWARD STOCKINGS
TO FILL AT THE END OF IT.”
radio comment on the con-
sumer-goods drive. There are
many complaints, for instance,
about the ‘antiquated’ Saratov-
-2 refrigerator which is still
being manufactured, the
‘clumsy and unattractive’
Podolsk sewing-machine ‘not
modernised for five years,’ old-
fashioned washing-machines,
and so on. Visitors to the
U.S.S.R. have noticed the very
poor quality of, for example,
footwear, cosmetics and furni-
ture design, and the virtual
non-existence of such every-
day things as detergents and
simple kitchen fixtures.
“Some of the most spectacu-
lar advances in the consumer-
goods field achieved in - the
West have been due to the
development of the plastics
industry. The U.S.S.R. last
year admitted its backward-
ness in this field and since
then a determined attempt has
been made to raise the level
of the Soviet chemical indus-
try. The U.S.S.R. is purchas-
ing modern equipment, com-
plete factories, and techno-
logical processes from firms
in Britain, West Germany,
Sweden, Italy and France.
Articles made from plastics
which are already on the
market or soon to be marketed
include baths, doors, polymer
boots, shopping-bags, tumblers
and lampshades. There is to
be a drive to step-up the
manufacture of man-made
fibres, and by 1965 ninety in
every hundred yards of
‘woollen’ fabrics produced will
in fact be artificial.
“The problem facing the
Soviet economy and consumer
is not only one of manufac-
turing the right article in the
required quantity, but of distri-
buting it as rationally as pos-
sible throughout the country.
Distribution has always been
a weak link in the U.S.S.R. and
other Communist countries.
The ‘Pravda’ leader (October
18, 1959) commenting on the
October resolution had this to
say: ‘lt is intolerable that
many simple household goods,
which could be successfully
produced on the spot, are
imported from other regions
and often from far afield.’
The Communist-party paper
adds that one cannot get
articles such as coat-hangers,
kitchen stools, or ironing-
boards in Kazakhstan, while a
great deal of timber-waste
remains unutilised in that
Republic.
“At present shops in the
U.S.S.R. have little control
over their stocks: they have
to take and try to sell what the
central trading organisation
decides to let them have. Even
the Government paper

should be bought by the

Christmas approaches again in that spiritual
season which embraces every climate. And here
in the warmth of an Australian summer the
Christian turns his mind once more to Bethlehem
and winter.
When I was in Jerusalem last year I made
the short journey down to Bethlehem. It was so
close as to be almost suburban, for while Nazareth
nestles in Galilee some seventy miles to the north,
the town where Christ was born is only a few miles
from Jerusalem.
In appearance it is much like other towns
in that countryside, yet it can claim above all
others in the world to be the place where
Christianity was cradled. Its Church of the
Nativity is built above the cave which has been
identified from the earliest Christian years as that
in which the Child was born.
The exact location was marked by the very
action which the Emperor Hadrian took in trying
to stamp out the veneration attached to it by early
Christians. In his time he built over it a pagan
shrine; just as he made certain the later discovery
of the site of Calvary at Jerusalem by raising above
it a temple to Venus.
One of the truths of which I was reminded
in Bethlehem, then, is that Faith will triumph over
the attempts of men in any age to suppress it.
Bethlehem's buildings and sub-structures are
witness to the years of change and challenge that
have passed since the first Christmas night. And
the centuried belief of millions is centred still in
the timeless message of Love and Goodwill that
was heralded there for a world to accept and
to practice.
Mankind comes to this Christmas with higher
hopes of international goodwill than when the bells
of Bethlehem were ringing a year ago.
That the true spirit of amity may spread and
be lasting, and that humanity may know the
blessings of peace in its full Christian meaning, is
the wish that accompanies the greetings I now
extend to you for a serene and joyful Christmas.
reigns in the trade-network,
instead of businesslike buying
and selling.’
“What this means in prac-
tice can be seen from the fol-
lowing examples given by
‘lzvestia.’ In Kuibychev, a
city of some 400,000 people,
no black thread could be had
this summer, although there
was a glut of white thread.
The shops had enough kapron
(Soviet nylon) stockings for
‘seven years of brisk trade,’
and stocks were being added
to, while other kinds of hose
were ‘practically never on sale.’
The scandalous state of affairs
was investigated by K.
Sorokin, a deputy to the
Regional Soviet, who was told
by a leading official of the
consumer-goods co-operative
organisation : ‘We sell what the
depots give us. For this
summer they sent us 200 pairs
of skis and flooded us with
dyes. It’s impossible not to
accept them. If we don’t, we
won’t get the saleable goods
and our trade turnover will
begin to come apart at the
seams.’ On the food-front
things are no better. The
Chief Grocery Administration
distributed enough jam and
macaroni for a year, while
such apparent delicacies as
spices and tinned hors d’oeuvres
were unobtainable.
“It was left to ‘Pravda :
(August 28, 1959) to translate
economic jargon into plain
Russian: ‘We have mastered
the sputniks. We have made
an atomic icebreaker. We
have built the greatest atomic-
power stations in the world.
Let us take the trouble pro-
perly to produce a pillow, or
pliers for drawing nails.’ The
paper, the official mouthpiece
of the C.P.S.U. Central Com-
mittee, illustrated its point by
a touching story of almost
Gogolesque pathos. A young
Sverdlovsk wife, after chiding
her husband that he had pro-
mised her the stars, reduces
her request to an electric-iron.
But no electric-irons have been
on sale in Sverdlovsk, a city of
half-a-million inhabitants, for
six months. Their friends rally
round and go to Moscow,
only to be told that irons would
be available in Sverdlovsk ‘in
a month or two.’ They are no
more successful when they try
to buy an electric-kettle or
even an ordinary down pillow
for the young couple. ‘Pravda’
explains that consumer-goods
programmes have being widely
dislocated by raw-material
shortages, inter - departmental
jealousies, and bureaucratic
muddle.”
New Nato Vision?
admitting that Nato
** has proved itself one of
the most beneficent and con-
structive international organi-
sations in history the “York-
shire Post” says that that
doesn’t mean it has earned
changeless eternal life:
“Nato is at present under-
going important, perhaps
fundamental changes. These
are the result of changes no
less radical in the international
situation. Since these changes
are on the whole for the good

teeth if Nato is submitted to an
analogous process of adjust-
ment?
“However, the idea of
change appears to be engender-
ing, particularly among the
permanent staff of Nato, an
atmosphere of serious con-
cern, if not of crisis. The con-
cern is perfectly natural: what’s
to become of this large,
elaborate apparatus which they
have built and maintained
throughout the years? The
grounds of their concern are
manifold. At least four have
aroused discussion and specula-
tion.
“First, since there are real
prospects 'of an easing in
world tension, almost every
member-State is showing con-
siderable reluctance to em-
bark on large-scale and costly
re-equipment of its armed


forces, and therefore of its Nato
complement.
“Second, there are clearly
cuts foreshadowed in American
aid, the cause of which lies in
the United States’ present
adverse balance of payments.
Third, there is President de
Gaulle’s somewhat stiff and, as
some think, self-consciously
‘nationalistic’ attitude to-
words Nato. And fourth, the

new technique of summitry or
near-summitry diplomacy has
sharply reduced the importance
of the North Atlantic Council
as both a clearing-house for
Western diplomacy and a
policy-making body.
“It may be that by permitting
Nato even momentarily to
languish the Western Nations
are endangering their own
security. This is, of course,
the opinion of those who
believe, out of grim and bitter
experience, and certainly not
without reason, that the menace
of direct Russian military
aggression is as imminent now
as it was 10 years ago. It is
their passionate conviction that
we in the West must not allow
ourselves to be lulled into a
mood of false security. This is
a view which, in the light of
all the experience of the past
20 years, it would be foolish
to brush aside.
“The question,- therefore,
resolves itself into something
at once subtler and more con-
structive than the alternatives:
should we keep Nato exactly as
it is now or should we let it
perish? It surely ought to be
phrased thus: what can be done
to give Nato, in the new phase
of world affairs, the practical,
political and military signifi-
cance which it has had during
the past decade? It may mean
a reorientation and a refashion-
ing of the whole organisation.
This implies the necessity for
a good deal of fresh thinking.
“New ideas are not always
easy to assimilate; but there
is in the contemporary world
situation one basic new idea
which is not difficult to grasp.
It has been expressed, with
characteristic simplicity, by
Field-Marshal Lord Mont-
gomery, both in the title of
his new book, and in a sentence
in his introduction to it. He
calls his book, which is a short
collection of newspaper articles
and lectures, An Approach
to Sanity. He says (and,
after all, he was for close on
10 years Deputy Supreme
Allied Commander in Europe):
‘lt seems to me that at long
last some sanity is now to be
introduced into international
affairs.’
“If this produces a crisis in
Nato, and nothing but a crisis,
then the sooner Nato is radi-
cally reformed and reconsti-
tuted the better. But what is
first needed in its councils is
a fresh vision, and the resolu-
tion to respond to that vision.”
Back to Cairo
Resumption of diplomatic
relations between Britain
and Egypt (at charge d'affaires
level for the time being) has
been accepted by most London
papers as desirable and logical.
There is a general tendency to
want to bury the past and see
what can be gained in the
future. The “Financial Times”
expresses the hope that both
countries will view the resump-
tion of relations “in a realistic
light”:
“Britain has important
interests in the Middle East.
President Nasser wields great
influence in the area —though
not as great as he himself
would wish. Clearly it is
desirable that problems involv-
ing both this country [U.K.] and
the U.A.R. should be discussed
directly between the interested
parties. On the trade side, too,
there will be advantages. Egypt
has long been an important
market for British goods, and
though our exports have
gradually been recovering they
are still well below the level
of the post-war years.
“The U.A.R., on the other
hand, must in its own interests
seek to maintain a trade
balanced between the West
and the Communist bloc.
Excessive reliance on Russian
goodwill in economic questions
might not be the best way to
ensure the most rapid economic
development. Both parties will
benefit if diplomatic exchanges
lead to an increase in the
exchange of goods.
“Finally, the resumption of
relations should help to speed
the liquidation of the after-
effects of the events leading up
to the rupture. The deseques-
tration of British-owned pro-
perty in Egypt has recently
appeared to be going somewhat
faster and more smoothly.
But a lot remains to be done.”
“Yorkshire Post” sees the
agreement as one of common-
sense. It says that after such
a grievous quarrel wounds
inflicted by both sides will take
a long time to heal and mutual
trust will not easily be
restored:
“But in the interests both
of commercial convenience and
of the gradual promotion of
confidence and good feeling
it is important that closer
official contacts should be
maintained. Our trading pros-
pects with Egypt are now
improving, and for his part
Colonel Nasser clearly sees
advantages in securing more
direct access to the British
Government. His experience
in dealing with the Soviet
Union seems to have been dis-
illusioning. He may very
wisely wish to preserve a life-
line with the West and to buy
aircraft and other needed
equipment from us.
“The results of this resump-
tion of more normal relation-
ships between the two countries
will be watched with care.
There will be no disposition
on the British side to rake-up
old scores if the Egyptian
Government can persuade the
enthusiasts of Cairo Radio to
drop their vitriolic propaganda
against us. We shall hope also
to see the more rapid release
of British property in Egypt
that has been sequestrated.
There are many ways in which
Colonel Nasser can show that
he wishes to let bygones be
bygones. In the meantime
Britain must soon seek to
establish closer communica-
tions with Syria and improve
her links with other Arab
countries.”
The “Economist” remarks
that for some time after the
hostilities of 1956 there was
no sensible alternative to
inaction, but that as time went
on inaction ceased to be
imperative and became less and
less masterly:
“No sustained or purposeful
attempt was made to pick up
the pieces ; instead such oppor-
tunities as occurred, admittedly
not very seductive in them-
selves, were allowed to pass
with an air of disinterest. This
was, of course, the hangover
from the choleric emotions of
1956. The outraged and out-
rageous mood of that year
made it impossible for London
to see Cairo straight ; the

obsession that President Nasser
must be got rid of was hard
to shed. The search for a
working relationship with
Nasser's Egypt, a logical con-
sequence of the Anglo-
Egyptian agreement of 1954,
was erased from practical
politics until the present day.
“Of the many causes of the
deterioration after 1954, the
most potent was the incontinent
profession of anti-imperialism
that suited President Nasser's
book at this time, but induced
in the British a sense of bitter-
ness and betrayal. The revolu-
tionary in whom hopes had
been placed as an honest man
anxious to improve the popular
lot was loosing his consider-
able energy in a stream of
demagoguery. Will the new
start be wrecked in the same
way? On the British side,
there is no place in the grey
mood of today for emotive
factors like a sense of betrayal.
In Egypt, the question is
whether President Nasser is
now prepared to give priority
to running his country over
the striking of provoking
attitudes.”
The “Spectator” would
apparently like to have seen
Prime Minister Macmillan don
a hair-shirt, but concedes that
he has the light:
“Egypt’s decision to resume
diplomatic relations with this
country is a reward for the
British Government’s good
behavior during the last few
months. It has done nothing
and it has done it quite well
a policy of non-intervention
at present is undoubtedly the
right one. Three years after
the invasion of Egypt in 1882
Mr. Gladstone was expressing
public regret for what he had
done, and it is a pity that Mr.
Macmillan has not similarly
brought himself to admit in
public that Suez was a dis-
graceful act of folly. Such a
statement of the obvious
would do untold good to
Anglo-Egyptian relations.
“President Nasser deserves
credit for not having demanded
such a statement and for treat-
ing the Prime Minister’s
attempts to excuse Suez with
the contempt they deserved by
ignoring them ; Mr. Macmillan
deserves credit for having
adopted a sensible policy, and
for refusing to allow his words
to influence his actions.”
The “News Chronicle” feels
that the “acceptance of harsh
political realities was clearly
inevitable—and necessary”:
“Britain has once more direct
official access to the vital centre
of the Arab world. Two
improvements are to be
expected immediately. An
end to hostile Cairo Radio
propaganda directed towards
East Africa, the Persian Gulf
and Aden, and a speeding-up
of the desequestration of
British property in Egypt.
“For President Nasser the
advantages are quite as great.
Cairo’s affair with Moscow
has not been one of unmiti-
gated bliss. Egypt is anxious
to redress the East-West
balance by resuming normal
relations with Britain. Both
sides are likely to benefit from
a resumption of trade. An
encouraging sign is the fact
that the Egyptians are already
planning to buy Comet air-
craft.

and Cairo is a sensible applica-

Apartheid Boycott
/Commenting on proposals to
boycott South African
goods in Britain as a protest
against the policy of apartheid,
London “Economist/ though
not doubting the good inten-
tions of the proposals, wonders
whether those who are making
them are not in fact mistaken:
“If a boycott did have a big
effect on South African trade,
it might upset many, farmers
in the Union. It would injure
the South African economy,
and thus South African natives
too, even though the sponsors
of the campaign try to argue
that it would not.
“But if the farmers then
complained to thpir Govern-
ment they would merely be
told that were the floodgates to
be opened to Communism they
would lose their entire farms
(besides having their daughters
married to Africans). In fact,
the usual effect of an attack
from outside is to rally public
opinion to the Government of
the day, however misguided.
“On the other hand if, as is
much more likely, the cam-
paign meets with only a small
response from a handful of
intellectual people, the Union
Government will be hardened
in its contempt for kaffir-
hoeties the world over, as not
only fools but also people of
no real substance or influence.
“When trade does not dip
after Oxford common-rooms
ban South African wine and
fruit (they will hardly affect
exports of wattle-bark) the
Union Government-will draw
its own conclusion: that trade
and politics are two things.
“In large degree they will be
right. The most that voluntary
boycotts of goods can be is a
moral reinforcement to an
attitude of disapproval. The
South African Government
need be —and is—in no doubt
that its policy encounters
massive disapproval in Britain.
But the pressure to force it to
change its policy must come
from inside South Africa. Signs
are not wanting that it will.”

Kendall, and independent pub-
lication of other books will
coincide with the festival, in-
cluding Southern Festival, a
South Australia anthology
sponsored by the Common-
wealth Literary Fund, and
Australian Art Today, edited
by Kym Bonython.
It is difficult to present
literature dramatically at a
festival, but in Adelaide
poets and other writers
will give public readings of
their work in the open air.
Recordings will be made by
Helen de Burgh. And there
will be no end of talk around
the subject of literature; some
in committee, but much at
gatherings open to the public.
Good talk and good wine—
the setting could be ideal.
The Miles Franklin award
for the year’s best Australian
book will be announced at the
festival; the award, of course,
is entirely independent of the
festival, but the time and place
are appropriate.
/Composers of Australian
music will be brought
together in a nation-wide
seminar organised by Unesco.
Professor Bishop, who is
director of Adelaide’s Elder
Conservatorium as well as
chairman of the Unesco
committee organising this
seminar, says the five-day pro-
gramme will include the per-
formance of new works as
well as technical discussion by
composers.
Ten of these works will be
specially published (as well as
performed) for the occasion
and will be on sale during the
festival.
The principal members of
the Unesco seminar will
be Professor George Loughlin
(Melbourne University), Pro-
fessor Donald Peart (Sydney
University), Professor Frank
Callaway (Perth University),
Dr. J. V. Peters (University of
Adelaide), Raymond Hanson
(N.S.W. Conservatorium) and
Margaret Sutherland (Mel-
bourne).
Other composers to be
invited are Robert Hughes,
Dorian le Gallienne, Miriam
Hyde, Clive Douglas, Alfred
Hill and two New Zealanders,
Douglas Lilburn and Dr.
Ronald Tremaine.
A nother classical presenta-
tion—but an unofficial
one —during the festival will
be wine. The visitor to
Adelaide can’t help being
impressed by the abundance
of good wine around him.
"Mind you, I'm glad they've caught him, but it'll teach
them to appreciate us law-abiding prisoners!"
South Australia produces 75
per cent, of all Australian
wines and 90 per cent, of our
brandy. A large part of this
wine and brandy is made
within 50 miles of Adelaide
itself. The Penfold winery at
Magill is only five miles from
the heart of the city.
Visitors to Adelaide during
and after the festival will find
they are welcome at many
vineyards, and tours will be
made to Penfold’s at Magill,
Smith’s at Yalumba, Sep-
pelt’s at Seppeltsfield, as
well as other wineries
in the Barossa Valley. The
inter-State newspapermen who
went to Adelaide for a festival
preview in November were
charmingly entertained at the
small and intimate winery of
Cyril Henschke, at Keyneton,
just as they were at Penfold’s,
Yalumba and elsewhere.
Those particularly wishing
to visit Hardy’s or Glenloth at
O’Halloran Hill no doubt
could have the matter quickly
arranged through the Wine-
makers’ Association of S.A.,
even though O’Halloran Hill
isn’t on the Barossa Valley
tourist route.
A meal at the Angaston
Hotel is a “must” on
the trip through the Barossa
Valley, some of the wines
served being produced from
vineyards “just down the road.”
Visiting newspapermen were
served with wild asparagus, a
delectable addition to a
delightful meal.
The appealing thing about
much of Adelaide and the
Barossa Valley is the compara-
tively quiet tempo of the place
and the old-world charm that
persists so widely. This is in
contrast with the tremendous
industrial thrust being gener-
ated in other parts of the
State, of which the visitor gets
a peek at the new satellite
town of Elizabeth, which
backs onto the weapons-
research establishment at Salis-
bury. But even in this brand-
new town of well-designed
brick cottages, which only, for
the present, lack the trees and
gardens necessary to make
them pleasant homes indeed,
the modern hotel is a spacious
and splendid one, and it serves
a wide range of South Aus-
tralia’s best wines. It has a
large, glassed-in lounge car-
peted in the Menzies tartan
and a beergarden in which
large canvas awnings cover
the patrons if it is too hot
or too wet to sit under the
bare heavens.
T/'isitors from the eastern
* States who wish to pro-
long their stay in South Aus-
tralia after the festival will
find the time of the year appro-
priate for visiting nearly all
the spots which are attractive
to the tourist. There are many
splendid fishing-places, includ-
ing Port Lincoln and Cowell,
on the western side of
Spencer Gulf; Kangaroo
Island is only half-an-hour by
air from Adelaide; and
there are beauty-spots quite
different from those encount-
ered on the eastern seaboard,
including the Flinders Ranges
at Wilpena Pound, which have
to be seen to be believed.
Ever since Hans Heysen
began painting in this area the
Flinders Ranges have had a
somewhat fabulous atmos-
phere about them. Now it is
possible to stay at a well-
appointed, Government - run
chalet at Wilpena Pound and
make daily excursions into the
ranges. In the cooler months
of the year the wildflowers are
at their best, and in midwinter
the climate is delightful.

Normally Paul took her to

walks off.
This means he has checked-
up and found that your chance
of a firing-job is
remote. He reckons it’s safe
now to get you to do the top-
half —the boiler, cab and
tender. If he had given you
the engine all-over when you
signed-on, and you had got a
firing-job, he would have had
a disorderly-cleaned engine on
his hands.
Your position seems to lose
significance. It’s ten-to-five,
and nearly an hour of your
availability gone. And among
all these engines and engine-
men you’re speedily being
reduced to a spectator.
Almost as if to sympathise
with your despondency the
atmosphere of activity changes.
It is the five-o’clock lull which
means there’ll be little doing
for the next half-hour. There
is a peculiarly infectious
silence; a sort of reminder
that outside the darkness per-
sists and also an awareness
that natural human tiredness
is battling against the arti-
ficiality of night-work. You
see the shed staff, one by one,
disappearing into engine-cabs
for a lay-off—s a.m. is always
the worst hour for the night-
worker.
And the circles of loco-
motives seem affected.
Steam murmurs from open
cylinder-cocks ; a soothing,
slumbering sound of power-
ful machines at rest.
Yet it seems uneasy rest ;
the rising steam somehow
seeks an ally in coal-smoke in
an urgent endeavor to dim the
brilliance of harsh electric-
lights. You can sympathise.
Even an engine may know
that darkness and silence are
natural for the night and the
night is natural for rest.
As you sit on the boiler-
dome of 990 you see Jimmy
curled-up on the tender. You
get deeper down in the dumps.
Sure, he can snooze ; he’s not
on the buzzer. But what does
it mean, now, to you? What,
except that you got up half-
way through the night to do a
job of cleaning that could
easily be done in daylight.
You throw down a patch of
cleaning-waste with bitterness.
Then you hear a stream of
abuse. There on the ground
is old Dadda unwinding
threads of waste from behind
his left ear:
“Are you deaf? Can’t you
hear the buzzer?” he bellows
at you.
You nearly fall off the boiler
in getting down. You apolo-
getically brush old Dadda
down from head to toe.
Making for the office, you
nearly hamstring yourself on
a water-hydrant.
Simultaneously the shed
takes life again. An engine-
whistle demands the turntable.
Shed statf and sand- and water-
joeys reappear like creatures
from dark caverns and flit
from engine to engine to
answer the drivers’ calls for
wood, sand and water. Crews
are throwing-up their kit-bags
onto footplates and this
time you are in the midst of
it all.
You are with Driver Hardy.
Of course, you know him;
you and all the other engine-
cleaners have summed-up every
driver in the depot. Driver
Hardy is: “Likes strong, black
tea.” “Doesn't like black
smoke or the safety-valves
blowing-off.” “Likes the foot-
plate well watered to keep
down the dust.” That is Driver
Hardy and you’ll pull the cab
roof down for him if he says
the word.
Your engine is now steam-
ing onto the turntable. You
lean so far out of the cab
with pride that if it wasn’t for
your heavy boots you’d fall
out completely. You see
Jimmy looking wistfully over.
“How'yer, Macca?” you
yell to him, loud enough for
the whole shed to hear.
The turntable-boy gives “All
clear.” And as your engine
moves-off to the departure-
road your driver is seeing
something humorous in the
situation . . .
Well! What if the loco,
you are firing was built back
in 1884? And what if you’re
only heading for the North
Melbourne coal-dump to
shunt trucks under the load-
ing-crane? You were on the
buzzer, weren’t you? And
now you’re firing, aren’t you?
Well!
“ ‘Put a fire on,’ you say,
mate? Sure, just tell me when
to stop shovelling!”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
M. Salaries
All this talk against the
increase in salaries and allow-
ances of the M.L.A.s of
N. does little to help
citizens get a true perspective.
Apart from the obnoxious
expedient of retrospective
legislation, aren’t the new rates
fair and reasonable? With the
public coming to regard M.P.s
more as servants and less as
chosen representatives, there is
some sense in the idea that
the pay of M.P.s should be
linked with that of public-
servants. Thereby M.P.s would
escape the odium which even
partial abdication of their
responsibility, such as reference
to the Wolfenden and Richard-
son Committees, engenders. A
fair and reasonable assessment
of the value of M.P.s on the
basis of their being public-
servants would put them in the
top brackets. But the idea
defeats itself, because Parlia-
ment fixes the salaries of higher-
grade public-servants.
Niggling about Parliamentary
salaries and talk of State
M.L.A.s being “second-rate”
stems from our neglect of
responsibility as citizens.
Although political parties are
at present necessary for the
working of . Parliamentary
democracy, less than 10 per
cent, of the electors belong to
political parties. This means
that the preselection of candi-
dates for Parliament is in the
hands of small groups of
people—a mixture of “willing
horses” and ambitious indi-
viduals.
The problem of persuading
more people to accept their
political responsibilities by
joining a party and helping to
secure an informed vote and
high-calibre office-bearers at
all levels is not helped by
compulsory - voting. John
Buchan once remarked that
democracy would not succeed
until it became an aristocracy
in the classical sense of the
word—the rule of the many
to be the rule of the best. A
small step in the right direction
“ That's our new fifty-pounds~a-Week Club cook. The
salary at first seemed too high for us—but We DID
rectify that."
was taken, in October, when
the Liberal Party N.S.W. Con-
vention voted for the aboli-
tion of compulsory-voting as
an essential item of future
Liberal-party policy.—C. C. M.
Usher (N.S.W.).
Territory Water
A couple of small amend-
ments .to D. C. Tilghman’s
interesting article (B. 2/12/’59):
Mundaring Weir, starting-point
of the Goldfields Water
Scheme in W.A., is in the
Darling, not the Stirling,
Ranges; and, since the original
G.W.S. in W.A. cost approxi-
mately £3 million, a similar
scheme for the Northern
Territory today would cost
considerably more than the
figure quoted by D. C. Tilgh-
man.—G. R. B. (W.A.).
King’s Park, Perth
Like “Boatman’s Mate”
(B. 2/12/’59) I at first thought
it would be fine to have an
aquatic centre in King’s Park.
Initially I believed that op-
ponents of the scheme were a
vociferous minority ; and like
“8.M.” I accepted the repeated
statement that the park was
being overrun with veldt-grass.
Later, I realised that the
opponents included some level-
headed people—scientists, busi-
nessmen, etc., all with the con-
viction that commercialised
sport isn’t the sole and only
concern of a civilised com-
munity. Then I discovered
there’s very little veldt-grass
in the park. Finally, I found
that these opponents were
neither a minority nor voci-
ferous.
It seems to me the scheme
was opposed by a majority of
Westralians. M.P.s were aware
that by voting against the pro-
posal they would be sitting
ducks for the press, which told
them, repeatedly, which way
they must vote, and woe betide
if the measure was rejected.
Rejected it waSj and by a big
majority. It is reasonable to
think that this majority spoke
for an equally substantial sec-
tion of the State’s voters.
In most directions within a
few miles of the centre of
Perth there are huge areas
of uncleared land potentially
suitable for sporting-fields.
Perth can be ringed with size-
able sportsgrounds, if the land
is reserved for that purpose.
The Empire Games is a City
of Perth project, and some
people think that the money
spent on fields for the Games
should be spent within the
city limits. I can’t see that the
entire cost of the Games will be
borne by City ratepayers.
The paying will be done by
W.A. as a whole and I feel it
would be a simple matter for
sports-fields to be provided
within reasonable distance of
Perth Town Hall.
There aren’t a great many
parks in Perth. “B.M.’s” sug-
gestion of converting King’s
Park into goif-courses, bowl-
ing-greens and tennis-courts is
in line with the current trend to
provide facilities for adults and
let the kids take a chance
amongst the traffic. Miles mean
little with modern transport,
and commercialised sport could
very easily accommodate itself
in the open spaces available
now, but which will soon be in
the centres of thriving suburbs.
—Pieter Nuyts (W.A.).
Aborigines
I hope “Pieter Nuyts’s”
views on the assimilation of
aborigines (B. 25 /11 / ’59)
will draw further comment
from correspondents with first-
hand knowledge of the sub-
ject ; but it seems to me his idea
of separate suburbs might
develop an “apartheid” —out-
look in both races and produce
tensions which do not exist
now.
To prevent the “black”
districts from becoming
noisome slums would call for
constant tutelage and super-
vision intolerable to the
native. In south - eastern
Queensland and in nearby
parts of N.S.W. the aborigines
have been “civilised” for
several generations ; yet most
of them live in shanty-towns
or in isolated humpies. Some
philanthropists claim that ex-
ploitation does not permit a
better living-standard ; but the
fact is that few aborigines have
much ambition to live other-
wise, and they fritter away

money which should provide
and furnish homes.
I doubt that there is much
serious crime among the
aborigines, at least in these
parts, or muqh of that brawling
and violence “P.N.” complains
about. The local ones (not
many are full-bloods) seem a
decent-enough crowd: quiet,
well-spoken, sometimes in-
dustrious ; likeable, but with
little capacity for the sustained
effort necessary for qualifying
in a profession or for learning
a trade.
A minority, though, appear
to have the capacity to acquire
our culture. I think these ones
are worth all the effort we can
spend on them, and a modi-
fication of “P.N.’s” plan of
separate suburbs is worth think-
ing about. — Jas. Macansh (Q.).
Rent Control
A house built about 70 years
ago was withdrawn from sale,
with vacant possession, after
being several months with a
couple of livewire local agents.
It was promptly let to a British
migrant-family. The owner,
who had bought a shop with
residence attached, had been
in occupation since the mid-
-1930’5, so the house was not
subject to rent-control.
I was told that the rental
charge was £l2 a week. The
tenants had also been obliged
to sign a three-year lease. To
help pay the rent they had
taken a sub-tenant.
Freeing of houses not pre-
viously let from rent-control
is unjust to owners of pro-
perties let when rent-control
came in. And the tenants of
such houses have to pay far
higher rentals than those lucky
enough to tenant a controlled
house. This tends to create a
privileged and unpriviliged
section of both landlords and
tenants.
Rent-control ought either to
be abandoned altogether or
made reasonable. The fairest
system would probably be a
rental based on a percentage
return on the capital value of
the property. This would mean
that hitherto privileged tenants
would have to pay higher
rents, but persons desperate for
a roof over their heads would
not have to pay extortionate
charges.
Provided a reasonable return
was assured with ready re-
possession by the owner for
personal occupation, there
should be plenty of older-type
houses available for letting.—
Cunedda (N.S.W.).
Wine v. Beer
General opinion seems to be
that New Australians of
Italian birth drink lots of wine.
But in the new North Queens-
land tobacco-areas they cer-
tainly don’t.
At morning smoke-oh, and
again in the afternoon, out
comes a bottle of coffee, a
kettle of tea, several packets
of biscuits and a bottle of beer.
They drink the lot, starting
with beer, then coffee, then
tea. They rarely drink water,'
saying that, in the intense heat
of the tobacco-farms, “water
can make you crook.”
Canecutters say that they
often take jobs offering less
money, since much of the good
money they earn in the cane-
fields goes in drink. They
reckon it costs them at least
£3 a week for beer to give
them an appetite to eat the food
to give them the strength to
cut the cane to earn the money
to buy the beer. — Toby Twirl
(N.Q.).
Australia and Indonesia
The P.M.’s visit to Indo-
nesia underlines the Malayan
P.M.’s suggestion that the
Malayan language should be
taught in Australian schools.
Indonesia is seeking
assistance from the non-Com-
munist world ; but she is eco-
nomically weak, and time isn’t
on our side. We can either
help her and make a friend, or
merely stand by and watch.
Malaya’s P.M., in putting
forward his suggestion, spoke
for “the 100-million people to
Australia’s immediate north”
who speak the Malayan
language. Assisting Indonesia
would react to our own benefit
by creating a strong and
expanding market for our
manufacturing industries.
Australia has the industrial
strength and know-how to
enable co-operation with Indo-
nesia in developing her
resources. What appears to be
lacking is a body of trained
men to go to those islands and
help the people to help them-
selves.— En Passant (N.S.W.).
Australian Architects
Several comments in Edwin
Morrisby’s Manchester
“Guardian” article on “Aus-
tralians in Britain” (“Un-
cabled Additions,” B. 9/12/’59),
provide food for thought. I
wonder whether, as Morrisby
maintains, “the standards of
taste in art and architecture are
not as high in the U.K. as they
are in Australia”?
In architecture the claim
seems hard to credit. Australia
started with a good architec-
tural tradition—a variant of the
late-Georgian style. This could
have been evolved into a really
satisfying local style, but from
the mid-19th-century it was
abandoned in favor of various
other styles. Some buildings to-
day have been designed in the
Colonial Georgian tradition,
but there has never been a
popular revival of this form.
From Francis Howard
Greenway, up to the present,
Australia has produced some
architects of class, although
scarcely any of world stature.
In every generation over the
same spati of time there have
been Britsh architects in that
category.^
The suburb where I live
typifies the sort of middle-
class suburban housing pro-
vided in Sydney in the 1920’s
and early 1930’5. Street after
street of bungalows in various
forms of the pseudo-Tudor
style, then popular ; few really
attractive in design or con-
venient in planning; many
poorly constructed. Judging
by photographs, much of the
English domestic building in
similar areas in the same period
was a long way ahead in de-
sign and planning. Post-war
Australian houses of the kind
are generally better in appear-
ance, construction and plan-
ning, but I don’t think they’re
superior to their British
counterparts.
Incidentally, there is far
more appreciation of historic
buildings in Great Britain than
there is in Australia. St.
Malo, the fine old mansion at
Sydney’s Hunter’s Hill, isn’t


the only Australian building
that has faced destruction. —
Farinmail (N.S.W.).
“People’s Capitalism”
Senator Ormonde’s recent
claim that “people’s capitalism”
—mass-ownership of company
shares by wage-earners—would
make Australia’s trade-unions
as powerless as those of Russia
was di striking example of the
unrealistic attitude to current
economic developments taken
by a certain type of Labor
politician.
People’s capitalism would
have no such effect. Wages
and conditions in Australia are
determined by arbitration or
sometimes by legislative action.
These would remain as readily
available as they are now.
Undoubtedly people’s
capitalism would strongly
influence the attitude of the
trade-union movement towards
industry; but it would be a
purely beneficial influence.
Numerous workers would have
a personal stake in the firms
they worked for, or in others.
Investment of their savings
would thus help economic pro-
gress, besides providing the
investors with dividend-income
and, in many cases, capital-
gains.
Militant unionism, concerned
primarily with fighting the
employers, would certainly lose
influence, for the shareholder-
unionist would demand a real-
istic and co-operative union
policy. Unions would still be
independent of outside control,
and still able to advance the
genuine interests of their
members.
Senator Ormonde’s further
complaint that extension of
company superannuation-
schemes constituted another
threat to unions was no more
reasonable.
Company superannuation
gives those covered a high
degree of economic security.
If a member of a scheme leaves,
or is dismissed, his contribu-
tions are returned to him.
These, in the case of a person
who has been a long time in
the one job, will amount to a
considerable sum ; and a
management would be reluc-
tant to dispense with the
services of one so protected.
Superannuation often pro-
vides substantially more income
in retirement than the old-age
pension. If a participant in a
superannuation-scheme pre-
fers to draw his money in a
lump-sum he can do this by
resigning a short time before
retirement is due. Not a few
workers have thus been able
to enjoy overseas tours, draw-
ing the pension on return.
Only a doctrinaire Socialist,
afraid that general establish-
ment of these schemes will
attach wage-earners firmly to
private enterprise, and thus
eliminate any possibility of
social revolution, can logically
denounce them. — Terry The
Tory (N.S.W.).
Bryant’s Record
Nothing “Farinmail” says
(B. 2/12/’59) establishes that
Bryant is an authority on
late-18th-century English
history.
Honorary doctorates do not
necessarily mean very much;
if “Farinmail” is impressed by
them, I may mention that both
J.L. and Barbara Hammond
have honorary doctorates from
Oxford.
Bryant’s Charles II is cer-
tainly authoritative, but this
has nothing to do with the
period under discussion. In-
cidentaily, a book-list issued
to history-students at New
England University came my
way. There were about 100
titles on the list, which pre-
sumably covered all history-
courses offered. Only one of
Bryant’s books —Charles II —
got a mention.
I can’t see that Bryant’s
biographies of George V and
Stanley Baldwin have much
bearing on the case ; and
surely the fact that he got a
gold medal for literature is
beside the point?
“Farinmail” shouldn’t be
misled into thinking that, be-
cause an author lists an
authority in his bibliography,
the author is necessarily “well
acquainted” with the authority.

Battle of the Brand
I bought a tin of salmon,
thinking by the brand
that it was an Australian
product, but it turned out to
be a Japanese import. This
particular brand is used as a
trade-name for South Coast
(N.S.W.) dairy-products, and
when one sees something bear-
ing this brand one assumes it
is a local product.
If this sort of thing develops
we’re likely to end up import-
ing Kangaroo-brand pearls,
Waratah butter, Platypus ham
and Anzac-brand biscuits. —

AN AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTION MERITS YOUR SUPPORT.
Sydney Municipal Library, and
the Broken Hill Public Library.
The only local lending-
libraries were those provided
by Schools of Arts, Mechanics’
Institutes and commercial
circulating-libraries.
The Free Library Movement
persuaded distinguished per-
sons from overseas to give lec-
tures and addresses in support
of its aims. It established
branches in the metropolitan
area and in country districts of
N.S.W., and subsequently
sponsored the establishment of
similar bodies in Victoria,
Queensland and Tasmania.
It led the N.S.W. State Gov-
ernment, in 1937, to set-up the
Libraries Advisory Committee,
on whose recommendations the
Library Act of 1939 was based.
War prevented the Act from
coming into operation until
January, 1944, when the
Library Board was constituted,
TT a . ~,
Up to the present 162 conn-
cils have adopted the Library
Act, and 141 of these have
library services in operation,
involving an expenditure, this

now have public-library ser-
vices available to them.
Looking back to what the
position was in 1939, this was
more than an exercise in “the
inevitability of gradualism”; it
was a near-miracle conjured
out of thin air by the diffident
York Street solicitor.
Geoff Remington was, as he
still is, the deputy-chairman of
the board and a trustee of the
Public Library of New South
Wales. If the Free Library
Movement and the benefac-
tions of David Scott Mitchell
and Sir William Dixson to the
Public Library constituted the
“Our first ship!”
machinery by which Aus-
tralian culture took giant steps
forward, then the efforts of
men such as Remington,
Mutch, Ferguson and Met-
calfe detonated its power —
but it was Remington who
threw the switch.
Just now he is heading a
committee geared to bring the
full research-resources of the
Public Library to the aid of
industry. “Knowledge is
power” is too fundamental a
truth to be overlooked by one
who would like to see the
axiom burned into the brain
of every Australian.
Tn War II they put Reming-
ton in the job of assistant
director of the Allied Works
Council in Queensland, at a
time when work had to be
done quickly. Starting from
nothing, he developed within
a few months a staff of over
400 and had 15,000 men
employed.
When he left the A.W.C. an
“open letter” to him was
printed in the “Building
Workers* Journal”; it was
headed “Big Men and Little
Men,” and it certainly left no
doubt as to the size of man
he emerged in the eyes of the
heterogeneous work-force he
commanded during those war
years. It was a straight-from-
the-heart tribute from rank-
and-file men.
Later he was appointed
liaison-officer between War
Organisation of Industry and
U.N.R.R.A.; then, in 1945, he
was made Chief Administrative
Officer and subsequently Act-
ing Director of U.N.R.R.A.,
South-west Pacific Area.
Then the peace—with the
old crusading spirit still as
active as ever.
some time he had been
puzzling over how the
principles and problems of
organisation and administra-
tion could best be taught to
young men of public and pri-
vate enterprise who would fill
executive positions in their
respective fields. Now he
interested fellow-members of
the Rotary Club of Sydney in
a proposition that was taking
shape in his mind.
Why not an Administrative
Staff College—a college that
would provide a course of
studies in the principles and
problems of organisation and
administration and would con-
duct research in administra-
tion?
Why not indeed! All that
was wanted was a mere
£250,000, a staff, a curriculum
and funds enough to sustain
such a project.
There was a familiar aridity
about the prospects ; yet in a
relatively brief time from when
Remington started things mov-
ing the Australian Administra-
tive Staff College was opened
on the shores of Port Phillip.
The governing body of the
college, as Remington had
foreseen, was a council whose
members represented many
phases of Australian private
and public enterprise. Mr
Essington Lewis was the first
chairman of the council and
Sir Douglas Copland its prin-
cipal.
What one of its co-
founders said recently of Rem-
ington’s association with the
college carries an echo of what
John Metcalfe, the librarian,
had said of him: “It will
always be within my know-
ledge, and the knowledge of

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
CATTLE-TICK
From “KAYTEE”
Agreeing with F. H. Finch
(B. 21 /10/’59) that com-
plete extermination of the
cattle-tick is the only answer,
I would, however, point out
that this is at present economi-
cally impossible in Australia.
The tick was introduced to
the Northern Territory in 1872,
spread across the Gulf country
into the Peninsula and down
the eastern coast of Queens-
land, and reached the N.S.W.
border, where, from 1902, it
was halted for four years. In
Queensland the pest is now vir-
tually confined to the very ex-
tensive eastern watershed of the
Great Dividing Range north
of Townsville —Mt. Isa rail-
way-line, though parts of
southern Queensland west of
the range are also infested.
Occasionally the tick spreads
into clean country, whereupon
State authorities take-over
dealing with it. The fact that
such outbreaks don’t often
occur is a tribute to the work
Recent reports indicate
that many leading U.S.
manufacturers of syn-
thetic-wool blend suits
are not enthusiastic
about the development
of the “wash-wear”
process. They believe
that after 1960 it will
not be an important
factor in suits. The
reason for this would
most certainly appear
to be the price struc-
ture. The risk of fly-
strike and other diseases
normally associated with
castration and tailing,
is greatly reduced with
the use of Elastrator
Rubber Rings, the
modern method of
castration and tailing,
because the Elastrator
method provides effec-
tive, humane castration
and tailing without loss
of blood or open
wounds.
of the stock-inspectors respon-
sible for control. The whole
country is indebted to these
inspectors and their counter-
parts in other States for saving
stock worth millions of pounds.
In the enormous tract of
“You may now hit the bride!”
mostly wild and' undeveloped
country which it infests control
by chemical means is next to
impossible; it will never be
got rid of until some effective
biological method of killing it
is discovered. The C.5.1.R.0.
has made a good start with its
experiments in pasture-spelling.
Certainly the U.S. authori-
ties exterminated the tick, but
their cattle-tick was a different
variety from the Boophilus
microplus found at present in
Australia, and its life-cycle
made it easier to deal with.
I feel that no one —and cer-
tainly not Dr. Legg —would
expect to obtain a 100 per cent,
kill under field-conditions,
even though such a kill may
be possible in experimental
work. In assessing the value
of any preparation which needs
mixing, the human element
must be considered. Where
one person will follow direc-
tions carefully, another will
merely give them a cursory
glance; so any dipping-
preparation is only as good as
the man who uses it.
Whether a 100 per cent, kill
is obtained or not, resistance
is likely to develop if the dip
is used long enough. For
instance, if the dip gives a
100 per cent, kill and will con-
tinue to do so for seven days
after dipping, from the eighth
day onwards the residual effect
will start to wane. This means
that some of the larvae attached
to the cattle will receive less
than a lethal dose, and will
survive and breed if not killed
by a subsequent dip before they
mature. If these ticks manage
to breed, and if their progeny
attach themselves to cattle at
a similar period after dipping
and succeeding generations go
on doing the same, resistance
may develop.
If all cattle can be dipped
at intervals short enough to
prevent any tick reaching
maturity, ticks could be
exterminated and no resistance
would develop ; but in condi-
tions ruling in much of
Queensland it is impossible to
get clean musters. Therefore
a reservoir of ticks is always
present on the property, and
resistance can develop even
though the dip is killing all
the ticks on all cattle that are
dipped. It must also be
remembered that rain after
dipping can reduce the residual
effect to zero and increase the
chances of resistance being
built up.
This development of resist-
ance doesn’t come, about over-
night, though. Finch mentions
how, though he had dipped to
control ticks for 20 years, he
suddenly found he could no
longer kill enough to prevent
“tick-worry” but resistance
had been developing from the
day he gave his cattle their
first dip; it was only the
recognition of it that was
sudden.
As far as Australian ticki-
cides go, it took 40 years for
ticks to develop resistance to
arsenic and 10 years for them
to overcome D.D.T.—so far
this resistance to D.D.T. is
confined to adult females, and
larval and nymphal forms still
succumb. The other chlorin-
ated hydrocarbons, not quite
so good, mostly give spectacu-
lar results but allow a high
degree of resistance to develop
quickly. So far no resistance
has been shown to the organic
phosphates.
Even though it may not!
seem urgent, everything pos-
sible must be done to prevent
the building-up of resistance
to a tickicide at any stage in
its use. We cannot expect
chemicals to keep turning-up
as we need them. It’s not
beyond the bounds of possi-
bility that we may find our-
selves again in much the same
position as in 1946: a howling
drought, and arsenic-resistant
ticks. On that occasion the
C.5.1.R.0. came to the rescue
with their colloidal suspension
of D.D.T. and saved Queens-
land’s cattle-industry. Next
time there may not be a
chemical to do the same trick.
Lctndrace Pigs
“Van”: Whatever the pros
and cons of the Land race pig
in Australia —and the pros
seem to be gaining the day—
I wonder whether Gordon
Bray, of the A.M.L. and F. Co.,
is taking the best wishes of
livestock branches of the
various State Departments of
Agriculture with him on his
overseas buying-trip. It seems
important to me that depart-
ments in all States should look
on the venture favorably and
do some buying on their own
account.
Agricultural Departments
have done well in -the past,
especially with stud-stock
work. Sometimes against
strong opposition from the
very people who would benefit,
they have persevered in keep-
ing bloodlines true, and have
provided first-class stock to
breeders at reasonable prices.
The Landrace breed pro-
vides for the industry an oppor-
tunity probably unequalled in

Civil Defence
A pamphlet entitled Defence
Against Radipactive Fallout On
the Farm has been published
by the Director of Civil
Defence for N.S.W. and is
available from his Sydney
office (211 Kent Street) or
from local C.D. Controllers in
shires and municipalities of
N.S.W.
The pamphlet, which is an
adaptation of one prepared by
the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture, explains the nature of
radioactive fallout which may
follow the explosion of nuclear
weapons during war, and
describes its effect on livestock,
land and crops. The booklet
includes advice about what a
farmer can do to minimise the
damage of this form of attack.
Locusts
“Acacia”: Periodic plagues
of locusts and grasshoppers
occur throughout the Com-
monwealth, and may cause
serious damage to pastures
and to cereal and fodder crops.
The following formula
makes an effective bait which
is easily prepared: |lb. arsenic-
pentoxide, 1 quart molasses,
251 b. bran and water.
In dry regions increase the
quantity of molasses to It
quart. This mixture is sufficient
to cover
Dissolve the arsenic with
lpt. boiling water in a four-
gallon container, and the
molasses, mixed with the same
amount of boiling water, in a
second container. Stir
thoroughly, then add half the
rest of the water to each con-
tainer and, after stirring the
mixtures again, pour the
molasses mixture into the
arsenical mixture, making sure
they mix well.
Spread the bran on a board
or sheet of flat-iron and add
the prepared solution. Work
this into a moist, loose mash
of the required consistency,
using tin scoops or similar
implements, because arsenic-
pentoxide is extremely
poisonous. Smear the hands
well with petroleum-jelly, both
when mixing and spreading the
bait, and thoroughly cleanse
them with soap after each
operation.
Control-measures must coin-
cide with the swarms being in
the ’hopper-stage. Broadcast
the bait thinly and evenly over
the whole area occupied by the
swarm, with a strip 30ft. wide
immediately in front of the
’hoppers. In cool weather
spread the bait during the
warm part of the day. Early
morning and late afternoon
are the most suitable times
in summer, because the
’hoppers are then usually in-
active during the warmest
hours.
A strict watch should be
kept during spring, when eggs,
which are laid in beds, begin
to hatch. The area of these
beds may be only a few square-
yards or up to several acres.
As the youngsters spread very
slowly until three weeks’ old,
baiting may be kept to a con-
fined area if they are detected
early.
Poultry and domestic
animals should be kept out of
paddocks that have been
treated. This is only a pre-
cautionary measure, because
the amount of poison on
properly baited 'ground is ex-
ceedingly small. Containers in
which baits are prepared
should, however, be kept out
of reach until emptied and
thoroughly washed.
Benzene - hexachloride
(8.H.C.), which may be used
instead of arsenic-pentoxide, is
practically non-poisonous to
man and stock. One pound of
10 per cent, or -J-lb. of 20 per
cent. B.H.C. powder is mixed
dry with 251 b. bran and 2gals.
water, and thoroughly mixed
into a moist, loose mash. This
requires no sweetening, and is
applied in the same way as
the arsenical mixture.
The Navy Helps
“Matelot”: A request from
the C.5.1.R.0. has resulted in
the offer of an R.A.N. heli-
copter for planting 12,000
clover-seedlings on a particu-
larly rugged part of the
Snowy Mountains to prevent
erosion and silting-up of dams
of the Snowy River project.
The site chosen for the
seedlings is on the slopes of
Carruther’s Peak—if a heli-
copter hadn’t been available
they would have had to be
taken there by packhorse. An
earlier attempt to plant the
seedlings by dropping them
from ordinary aircraft failed
because, even when enclosed in
light fibre cups, they were
badly damaged when they hit
the earth. The seedlings will
now be planted by hand after
the ’copter has lifted them.
The machine to be used is
a Bristol Sycamore piloted by
an officer of 725 Squadron
from the R.A.N. air-station,
H.M.A.S. Albatross, at Nowra
(N.S.W.).
Cream-tests
“Agricola”: Nothing is more
irritating than to get fluctuating
cream-tests from the butter-
factory. Of course, it’s easy
to blame the factory and get
the urge to dash into town and
annihilate the tester. But most
times the fault lies on the farm.
Many factors can cause tests
to fluctuate. If the cream-
screw in the separator is loose
in its recess the vibration of
the bowl may cause it to move
in or out, altering the tests
every time it moves. As the
movement is irregular, so are
the tests. The screw should
be firm in its thread, and
should only be moved when
necessary.
Richness of the milk is
another cause of tests vary-
ing. Provided the separator
is running properly it will
always deliver a set amount of
skim-milk to a set amount of
cream. Generally, this is about
one part of cream to nine
parts of skim-milk. Thus, to a
gallon of milk we should get
a pound of cream.
If the milk is very rich the
cream will have a high test.
If the milk tests poorly the
cream will have a lower test.
From this it is easy to follow
why tests vary with the season
and the type of cow being
milked.
A sudden flush of newly-
calved cows in the herd is
almost sure to lower the test
of the milk in the vat. The
amount of cream will remain
the same —approximately one
part to nine parts of milk—
but the test of the cream itself
will be lower. This is one

reason why it’s almost impos-
sible for tests not to fluctuate
to some extent.
Belts slipping on the
separator-drive can also cause
tests to vary. The faster the
bowl spins, the richer the
cream. On the other hand,
the slower the speed of the
bowl, the thinner the cream.
Slipping belts are common
wherever temperatures change
rapidly. Wet weather causes
belts to tighten, and tests may
be around the 40 per cent,
mark while the belt is like
this, but as soon as drier
weather comes the belt
becomes too slack and the
speed of the separator will be
reduced consequently, the
cream-test will be lower.
The rate at which the milk
flows from the vat into the
bowl affects the cream-test,
too. The machine is made
to take a set flow of milk an
hour, according to make.
Provided the speed is correct
and the rate of flow constant,
the separator will turn-out tests
that fluctuate little ; but if the
flow is suddenly altered the
test will immediately alter, too.
If the rate of flow is increased
the cream will become thinner ;
if you reduce the rate of flow
of milk entering the bowl the
cream becomes thicker.
The temperature of milk also
influences the test of the
cream. As the milk becomes
colder the test rises, and vice
versa.
Much of the trouble of
fluctuating tests comes from
flushing-out the separator-
bowl after all the milk has
gone through. If the same
amount of warm water is
always used to flush the bowl
the tests should not be upset
to any great extent.
Cream-tests will, of course,
always vary to some extent.
It’s time enough to worry when
the variations are great.
The Big Six
“Vetsci”: Since Robert
Bakewell (1725-95) evolved the
breeds of British beef-cattle
we know today beef-produc-
tion has spread over harsher
and less-favorable parts of the
world. To fulfil the needs
of these areas American
breeders have carried on Bake-
well’s ideas and developed
these six new breeds:
Brafords, now to be found
only in Texas, and originally
established with Brahman bulls
over a Hereford stock and then
back-crossed.
Brahmans, of which there
are now 27 distinct breeds.
originally founded in America
by combining the genes of
Nellore, Guzerati, Sindhi and
Krishna cattle.
Santa Gertrudis, all descen-
ded from the bull Monkey
and evolved from five-eighths
Shorthorn and three-eighths
Brahman blood.
Beefmasters, established on
half Brahman, quarter Short-
horn and quarter Hereford
blood.
Brangus, from joining Brah-
mans with Aberdeen Angus.
Charblay, newest of all beef-
cattle breeds, a cross between
French white Charolais cattle
and Brahmans.
Serrated Tussock
“Zorok”: Serrated tussock
is a noxious weed which can
take possession of a paddock
and kill-off all grasses. Stock
will not touch it.
The problem of its exter-
mination is now so great that
special committees have been
formed to tackle it.
A meeting of the Central
and Southern Tablelands Ser-
rated Tussock Committee was
held recently at Goulburn
(N.S.W.), where means of
control were discussed at great
length.
Some councillors thought
that the best chance of success
was to plan its destruction on
a uniform basis over a very
wide area, and that this could
be best done by organising a
trust.
However, most councillors
did not favor this idea, and
rightly so —such a trust would
be, in essence, another rating
authority, and one not answer-
able to ratepayers. The
general view was that county
councils could do the job if
they were given enough money.
That is undoubtedly the
catch. Though it is claimed
that a deputation from the
committee to the N.S.W.
Government was sympatheti-
cally received, no actual
promises were made.
Though members of this
committee feel that the matter
can be dealt with by county
councils, I am convinced that
the problem will eventually
have to be dealt with by the
Government.
Some of the statements made
by different councillors at this
meeting point to the serious-
ness of the problem. “Serrated
tussock is a much greater
problem than Bathurst-burr or
noogoora - burr ever was.”
“It’s definitely on the increase
—it’s taking-over a greater
area of land every year.”
“There are over a million
acres of infested country in
Upper Macquarie County
Council —I have not seen one
acre in the county that has
not had serrated tussock on it.”
Large infestations in inacces-
sible country make control
difficult, because it spreads so
quickly. Some county, coun-
cils are at present experiment-
ing with treatment of T.C.A.
by air. If this treatment is
successful, it could mean the
eventual extermination of the
pest.
FSood Control
“Barcoo”: The ultimate
answer to “Drought and
Flood Serial” (B. 4/11/’59) is
to be found in Louis Brom-
field’s Out of the Earth, where
“The Muskingum Story”
(Chapter VIII) surveys every
aspect of the problems asso-
ciated with flood-control and
describes what has been
achieved in the Muskingum
River area, Ohio (U.S.A.).
There seems no reason —
beyond lack of co-operation
and co-ordination among
public and private interests
involved—why the methods
there described should not be
applied to similar problems in
Australia.
Bromfield concludes his
survey with the terse com-
ment: “The pattern is there, a
pattern which any child can
understand. Perhaps it is too
simple and obvious. More
likely it is simply not grandiose
enough or futile or expensive
enough to merit the interest
of the military and the bureau-
crats.”
Having known what it is to

Queensland should have good general rains during
January, with heaviest falls on the Peninsula and in the
north-western and coastal districts. Flooding is likely in
part of the south-western, south-eastern, central and
northern divisions.
N.S.W. should also have good general rains during

moderate and patchy in the Mallee and Wimmera. Similar
rains are likely in February.
Rainfall may be patchy in South Australia during
January, varying fr'om light to moderate, with isolated
heavy falls in the interior. Heavy storm-rains are probable
in the central districts during February.
Good rains should be received in Western Australia
during January, heaviest on the north-west coastal districts
and possibly associated with a willy-willy in mid-January.

Drought Feeding
“Mulga”: Stockpiling fodder
in readiness for the next
drought, sheepmen on Queens-
land’s Darling Downs have
been storing roughage—Jap-
anese millet, white-panicum,
cereal stubble, etc —which may
be purchased cheaply in season.
Since there’s no grain in this
fodder, stacks do not attract
rats or mice, and they open-
up in good condition even after
long storage.
Grains sorghum, wheat,
oats, etc. —are also being
stored for feeding in mixture
with the roughage. Sheep are
inclined to gorge when grain
is fed alone, but not when an
equal weight of roughage is
mixed with the grain, and lib.
finely-ground limestone and
ilb. coarse-salt are added for
every 101 b. of the mixture.
Inclusion of 101 b. meatmeal
will increase the protein-con-
tent, but, since sheep are not
very partial to meatmeal, it’s
best to use smaller quantities
at first, until they become
accustomed to it.
The food-value of rations
varies. Wheat, maize, barley
and sorghum, for instance,
have 77 food-units for each
1001 b. ; oats are lower, with
60 food-units, and lucerne-
chaff has 40. This means that
sorghum, etc., fed at the rate
of 4oz. a sheep a day is equal
to 6oz. oats or Boz. lucerne-
chaff.
A hammermill with 1 in.
screen is used to convert both
roughage and grain to meal,
equal quantities of both being
fed into the machine together.
If the hammermill has no grain-
box, use a kerosene-tin with a
hole punched through the
'bottom to allow the grain to
flow while the hay is being
milled. Moistening the ration
with lib. molasses mixed in
lOgals. water will also make it
more palatable.
To avoid waste the roughage-
grain mixture should be fed
from troughs, though sheep
which have never before been
hand-fed are apt to be wary of
fodder set-out in troughs and.
before they learn to eat, may
even fall-away to the point of
death. It’s best to be ready
by teaching a small flock to eat
from troughs and, when these
feed well, ear-tagging or brand-
ing them, so that when hand-
feeding becomes necessary they
can be mustered and drafted
to the groups that need feeding,
where they can teach the rest.
When building-up this flock,
muster a few more than you
intend to tag, and hold them
in a small well-watered pad-
dock. Set the ration out in
troughs (allowing 50ft. to 100
sheep), spread green lucerne-
hay or green grass on top,
spray it with molasses and
water, and then sprinkle it with
a small amount of coarse salt.
If this is done when the sheep
are in good condition they will
come to no harm by being
starved a little until they inves-
tigate the fodder in the troughs.
Draft-out those that will not
readily take the feed and
replace them.
Besides the crop-stubbles men-
tioned there are many plants
and grasses which, although
nutritious, are unpalatable
to stock because they are
spiny, coarse-leaved or thorny.
During the 1957-58 drought
one grazier I know of mowed
an area heavily infested with
galvanised - burr (B assi a
durchii), and, putting this,
when dry, through a hammer-
mill, successfully fed the meal
to cattle and sheep as roughage.
Declared a noxious weed, this
plant is nutritious, though
stock won’t touch it because it
is prickly.
Some spinifex-grasses, green
for most of the year, but
untouched because of their
hard tough stems, could be
made into hay and, reduced to
meal in a hammermill, used as
a cheap, economical standby.
Even if it contains little
nourishment, this roughage will
fill the animals’ bellies, and
with a little concentrate added
it makes quite good feed.

From Captain J. J. Van der
Starre, 39 Pauwenlaan, The Hague,
Holland: My special hobby is
collecting postage-stamps showing
ships, and I try to get copies of
the original photographs, etchings
or paintings from which the stamp
pictures have been composed. I’m
particularly anxious to get original
representations (postcard-size, pre-
ferably) of the following stamps.
Here are details of the stamps:
(a) Three stamps issued in 1932,
showing the Sydney Harbor Bridge. I
understand the picture of the stamp
was drawn by artists of the note-print-
ing branch of the Commonwealth Bank
of Australia, (b) The 2s. stamp issued
in 1953 to commemorate the sesquicen-
tenai'y of settlement in Tasmania. I’ve
been told that this stamp was adapted
and drawn by the artists of the note-
printing branch from an original sketch
entitled “First Establishment on the
River Derwent.”
Also, I'd like a copy of the picture
of Captain Cook’s H.M.S.
Endeavour. Can anyone help me?
To buy the following books by
Max Shulman: Barefoot Boy With
Cheek, The Zebra Derby, and
The Many Laves of Dobie GUlis.

Where are glass-sands found in
Australia ?
Glass-sands occur within reason-
able distance of all the capital cities
of Australia. In the Sydney metro-
politan area the deposits of white
Botany sand are comparatively easy
to purify, and yield a washed
product on a par with the renowned
Flemish silver sands. The Botany
sand is a free, rounded-grain, wind-
blown type derived from the
Hawkesb'ury sandstones. Sands
suitable for glass-making occur
within 25 miles of Melbourne. In
S.A., high-grade glass-sand is
obtained at Longwood by crushing
and washing a friable argillaceous
sandstone. Large quantities of a
high-grade glass-sand occur near
Perth (W.A.) and the quality is
comparable with that of Fontaine-
bleau and other good glass-sands.

When was the new Hawkesbury
River (N.S.W.), railway-bridge
built ? General information on it ?
Work on the new bridge, which
replaced the original railway-bridge
built by an American company in
1889, started in July, 1940; but,
despite strenuous efforts, it was not
completed until after the end of the
war, and was opened for traffic on
July 1, 1946. Built 200yds. above
the site of the old one, the new
bridge has four steel spans of
347 ft. 6in. in the centre, two spans
of 445 ft. Bin. and two 147 ft.
approach-spans. There are five
“Africa Was fabulous !”
piers founded in sand at depths
of 173ft.-183ft. and three piers
founded on rock; the caissons are
51ft. long and 29ft. wide; total
length, 2764 ft. Tunnels had to
be driven at both approaches. The
spans of the bridge were built on
shore, raised to a suitable height by
means of large electrically-driven
screws, and then floated out at high-
tide on punts to the piers, where
they were settled onto their bearings
as the tide dropped. The spans
of the old bridge were removed
by the same method. Total weight
of steel in the superstructure of
the new bridge is 7860 tons.
Brief Answers
R.H.L.: No details about such
a tree. However, it seems unlikely
that it would still be living after
that length of time. “Grandfather
Peter,” on Tamborine Mountain,
south-east of Brisbane, was a
20ft.-high specimen of the ancient
plant known as cycad, and it was
probably around 1000 years old. It
was destroyed by vandals in the
1930’5. And a living redgum, about
300 years old, stands in a reserva-
tion near the St. Kilda Junction,
Melbourne... .Mrs. G.: De Sade,
by B. Egan and B. de Shane, was
published in London in 1929 at a
cost of 635. It was still in print
in London in 1940, but the price
had dropped to 10s. 6d. A copy
of the edition limited to 100 copies,
and bound in morocco, was sold
at auction in New York in 1954
for $5, and one of the limited
edition, bound in cloth, was sold
in New York in 1956 for.sls. No
biographical information about
the two authors available.

THE HOLLIDAYS
New Recordings
“Oh, yes, ‘Well show them how they ride a board on Bondi beach,’ says Mr. Smart Alick!”
A Tour in Stereo
Modern communications
being what they are, it rarely
surprises one to learn of jazz-
bands whizzing from place to
place, stopping long enough to
play a few numbers before
tearing off again ; so there is
little out of the ordinary in
bandman Les Elgart’s latest
Coronet jacket: the title at
the top (Les Elgar t on Tour),
and a photo of smiling Mr.
Elgart and two equally happy
air-hostesses underneath.
There is, however, plenty of
fresh playing—and some first-
class sound—on the record
itself. It’s a dance-music disk,
and one has no doubt that
dancers, depending on the
vocabulary of the moment,
would find it smooth or cool or
hot or real gone. For the
student of dance-band styles of
presentation, Elgart seems to
be about midway between the
improvisatory school and the
“strict tempo” boys ; in fact,
with an orchestra drawing on
brass- and reed-colors for its
principal effects, he gets an
amalgamation of studied care-
lessness and strict time.
The record starts with
“Strike Up The Band,” and
immediately the stereo-process
separates the piercing tone of
the trombones from the mellow
saxophones. In “Can’t We Be
Friends” there is an intriguing
trill on the brass instruments —
a touch of Tschaikowsky—and
“Indian Summer” is painted in
turn with bright and subdued
brush-strokes. “Homecoming”
(surely this should have come
later?) is a snappy piece, high-
lighted by suppleness in the
trumpet-tone; and “It’s The
Talk Of The Town” is rather a
pensive job. Probably it’s put
here so that people who have
vigorously cut the rug during
previous numbers can relax —
but only for a minute, because
“Shuffle Off To Buffalo,” last
on the first side, is brisk and
cheerful. Incidentally, this is
a fairly involved arrangement,
for the trombones add a leap-
ing counterpoint to the main
melody.
First on the second side is
“Shine,” chiefly interesting in
a quasi-improvised freshness
reminiscent of Goodman.
“Whispering” raises the eternal
question of treatment: can a
tune, clothed in new orchestral
colors and assuming a different
beat, emerge as something
totally new? In present re-
viewer’s opinion it can never
quite be done. You still have
traces of the original and
often these traces help to make
the new arrangement finally
satisfying. Bearing the title
in mind, this number, rolled
out in forthright reed-colors, is
something of a musical paradox.
There is a beat just for the
feet and a solo break for sax.
in “Five Foot Two, Eyes of
Blue”; “How Deep Is The
Ocean” is really effective in
its brassy new suit —a gentle
number, appositely almost blue.
Finally is the pirouetting
“South,” which gives a neat
precis of Elgart’s qualities:
cleanness of attack ; a generally
interesting use of tone-colors ;
good playing; and a flexibly
exact sense of timing. The
only disconcerting thing is the
burst of clapping which greets
every number. It doesn’t sound
spontaneous (although in
stereo it seems to spread
around the room) and tends
to leave one wondering
whether it’s a studio job.
A. W.
Choir
Except for occasionally
uncomfortable bass “presence,”
tending to add a bloated depth
to their efforts, the Luboff
people on KEP 131 (45 r.p.m.)
are as good as usual. Here they
present a few chestnuts ; on the
first side there is the barber-
shop sentiment of “When
You Were Sweet Sixteen,” a
nice foil for the much more
substantial melody “Believe
Me If All Those Endearing
Young Charms.” The reverse-
side opens with “I’ll Take You
Home Again, Kathleen,” most
interesting for the mosaic effect
of rich shifting chords at the
end ; and the lush “Love’s Old
Sweet Song.” The choir has
happily gone back to the
pleasant mouth-organ accom-
paniment. Thus, because the
accompaniment is sparse, the
singers are in the front of the
picture all the time.
*** +*<•
Conniff
Ray Connitf’s incisively
rhythmic beat and his skilful
use of contrasted instrumental
colors show-up well in his
latest release, Hollywood in
Rhythm (KLP 796). Conniff
leans heavily to the film-makers
for subject-matter ; maybe this
is one way of putting new life
into old hits, but one tires of
such things as “Love Letters”
and “Love is a Many-Splen-
dored Thing.” However, the
sound is clean and nicely
spaced, and, as dance-disks go,
it’s well worth while. Conniff
lets the brass do some extra-
ordinary things, but this in no
way detracts from general
orchestral zip. Numbers include
“Easy To Love,” “Stella By
Star 1 i g h t,” “Yesterdays,”
“Please,” “My Heart Stood
Still,” “Pacific Sunset” (written
by Conniff himself), “Laura”
and “Cheek to Cheek.”


Women’s Letters
MELBOURNE
In wishing all those who read this
page a happy Christmas and every good
wish for the New Year, this Letter is
reminded of the little verse that accom-
panied the Lord Mayor’s Christmas-card,
which depicts a bowl of pink rhododend-
rons —his own painting: “Flowers in the
garden, meat in the hall ; A bin of wine,
a spice of wit, a house with lawns
enclosing it.”
The Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress
(Cr. and Mrs. Bernard Evans), who
earlier in the week had entertained over
50 pressmen and presswomen at a
delightful buffet-dinner party in their
Toorak home —the city’s first First
Citizens to thus do honor to the Fourth
Estate —were hosts at a gay Christmas-
party in the Lower Town Hall. There
was a huge illuminated Christmas-tree ;
and at one end of the hall a small garden
enclosed a waterfall. Mrs. Evans wel-
comed her guests in a short frock of
white silk scattered with clusters of
violets, with a wide sash of Parma-violet
chiffon. Assisting their parents were
Mrs. Louis Sallmann, Margot Evans
(wearing a pretty frock of pastel-silk
taffeta) and son Ronald (whose wife
chose a short sheath-frock of blush-pink
guipure-lace). Among the young guests
were Kay Setches (her short black-lace
frock worn with a chiffon-mantilla edged
with lace); Virginia Lansell, wearing a
bouffant white tulle-frock ; Eileen Solly,
in mauve nylon trimmed with matching
satin ; her sister Noel, who wore a
deep-hyacinth blue-lace frock ; Sarah
Luxton, who wore with her full-length
white satin gown a powder-blue satin-
stole ; and Susan Campbell, whose satins
were lipstick-pink.

The Premiers’ wife, Mrs. Henry Bolte
(wearing an attractive frock of white
silk patterned in autumn tonings and a
wide-brimmed hat of caramel straw
banded in deep-brown grosgrain-ribbon),
was guest-of-honor at a luncheon given
by the Young Contingent of the Victoria
League at the Collins Street clubrooms.
Mrs. Bolte was received by chairman Max
Chapman. The league’s senior vice-
president, Mrs. Guy Bakewell, and
another vice-president, Mrs. Robert
Hamilton, attended.
☆ ☆ ☆
Fred Asmussen, display-manager for
the Myer Emporium, can always be
depended on to come to light with
unusual and beautiful windoW-displays,
and this Christmas he has excelled
himself. Each window tells, pictorially,
a well-loved fairy-story. Cinderella is
seen fleeing from the Prince leaving her
glass-slipper on the stairs; the Babes
in the Wood lie huddled together covered
with leaves while the birds watch over
them ; Thumbelina arrives on the back
of a swallow in the land where the
handsome Prince is waiting for her ; the
tragic Little Match Girl kneels pitifully
alone in the snow-covered street, but
when she lights her match the magnifi-
cent figure of the Christmas-tree Fairy
appears in all her golden beauty in a
gown adorned with gilded holly-leaves,
golden roses, gold baubles and multi-
colored stones ; Hansel and Gretel, and
Jack and the Beanstalk are also there.
But the richest is the story of the
Nativity, shown strikingly in the huge
central window. It goes to the very
heart of Christmas.
Christmas attraction at the Little
Theatre is Irene Mitchell’s production
of the gay French farce “An Italian
Straw Hat," in which attractive Pauline
Charleston appears as Madame Beau-
jolais. Pauline, who has had a long
association with the Little Theatre but
now limits herself to two plays a year,
helped in making the lavish 19th-century
costumes which are a feature of this
production and which were designed by
John Truscott. Pauline is the mother of
two young daughters, Celia and Caroline.
Sick and neglected animals weren’t
forgotten in the busy Christmas period,
for the Raveloe Auxiliary of the Animal
Welfare League arranged a chicken-and-
champagne party to raise money for the
league. Sir Norman and Dame Mabel
Brookes lent their South Yarra home,
Kurneh, the ballroom being decorated
with bowls of mixed flowers. The Lady
Mayoress, Mrs. Bernard Evans, was
received by Dame Mabel, auxiliary-
president Mrs. N. Linton, and hon.
secretary Pamela Middleton. Other mem-
bers of the committee who helped during
the evening were Mrs. Peter Lynch, Mrs.
Warford Mein and Winsome Dane.
During the party there was- a parade
of fashions, which were lent by Mr.
and Trevaskis and modelled by
committee-members Ann Gorman, Mrs.
James Buchanan, Pat Moffat, Eve Witte,
Robin Dane and Barbara Murray Smith.
A number of the younger members who
designed original Christmas - hats and
wore them at the party were Margot
Evans, Sally Newcombe and Carol
Steeley.

Bowls of Christmas-lilies, pink and
white gladioli and hydrangeas were the
decorations used when Dr. and Mrs.
Robert Wyllie dispensed Christmas cheer
to 30 of their friends. Mrs. Wyllie chose
a full-skirted frock of white waffle-cotton
patterned in green flowers. Guests
included Dr. Olaf Simpson (here from
Scotland on a research-scholarship) and
his sister Betty ; Mr. and Mrs. Colin Kerr
Grant ; Dr. and Mrs. Bob Barter; Mr.
and Mrs. Milton Bridgeland; Mr. and
Mrs. lan Mcßoberts; Mrs. Douglas
Helsham ; Mr. and Mrs. Bruce Camp-

black frock highlighted with a sash and
bow of pink taffeta); Mr. and Mrs. Frank

(her frock of sea-green silk-shantung);
Dr. and Mrs. Tom Lowe (the latter
wearing black French-crepe); and Mr.

Fairylights were strung from the
lovely old trees in the spacious grounds
of Como, South Yarra, when the newly-
formed junior section of the National
Trust of Australia (Victoria), under
president Rodney Davidson, held its first
buffet cocktail-party. Como —the first
historic home to be acquired by the
trust —is a gracious centenarian. In place
of the crinolines and bustles of former
years, gay short cottons swinging below
the knees gave the modern touch. Among
the 350 guests were Elizabeth Duckett,
Pamela Middleton, Barbara Zinnow, Jan
Newman, Anne Curtis, Prue Elder, Anne
Lowry, Fiona Baillieu and Jenny
Maekay.

A dinner-dance arranged by the
Parents’ Association to help school-funds
was held in a marquee set up in the
garden of St. Catherine’s and gaily
decorated with hydrangeas and trails of
gold ivy-leaves. The headmistress, Miss
M. Davis, with the president of the ball-
committee, Mrs. T. L. Webb, and Mr.
Webb, welcomed the guests. School-
council chairman J. C. Campbell and
Mrs. Campbell, and Old Girls’ Associa-

SYDNEY
For Sydney this has been a week of
farewells. First, it has bidden “God
speed” to Sir William Slim, who has
been Governor-General for the past 6C
years, and to Lady Slim, who has been
a model of graciousness and an inspira-
tion to the women of this country over
the whole of that period.
“It is not easy to say good-bye,” said
Sir William at the reception given in
their honor by the Lord Mayor on
Thursday. He said that two things
remained as overriding impressions of
their time in Australia: firstly, the kind-
ness of the people ; and, secondly, the
surge of progress which they had found
invigorating, thrilling and stimulating.
Sir William spoke of the Sydney
Opera House (“I would like to see it go
up. So far I have only seen it go
down.”) as a symbol that this great
city values other things outside of wealth
and commercial success. He ended his
speech with a simple, heartfelt “Good-
bye” which touched the chord of sym-
pathy he and Lady Slim have sounded
throughout their term of office.
Earlier in the week the Governor and
Lady Woodward gave' a reception at
Government House in honor of Sir
William and Lady Slim. Assisting them
in entertaining the 200 guests was their
daughter, Mrs. Miles Little ; and among
those present were Lieut.-General Sir
John Northcott, Mr. and Mrs. Russell
Nash, Sir Norman and Lady Gregg, Sir
Kenneth and Lady Coles, Sir Victor and
Lady Windeyer, Mr. and Mrs. W. C.
Wentworth, Judge Curlewis. and Mrs.
Curlewis, and Mr. and Mrs. A. G. Potter.
Present, too, was Sir Kenneth Street,
who was himself farewelled as Chief
Justice of N. S. Wales during the week.
But he will remain as Lieut.-Governor,
so we will still be able to hear those
beautifully-constructed speeches, that fine
and quizzical humor which make his
Honor such a pleasure to listen to.
☆ ☆ ☆
Other parties included the State
Dinner given by the Government of
N. S. Wales and the lovely party for
450 guests which Sir William and Lady
Slim themselves gave at Admiralty House
on Thursday night. It was a fine night
and the harborside gardens of the beauti-
ful old house made an attractive setting
for one of Sydney’s most delightful
parties.
☆ ☆ ☆
By the way, future v.i.p. visitors to
this city will have the benefit of Lady
Slim’s exquisite taste when they are
entertained in the reception-rooms of
Admiralty House. Here a motif of
cream-and-gold has been subtly con-
trasted with delicate shades of haze-blue
and cloud-pink, an unusual combination
which was Lady Slim’s own inspiration.
The restoration and decoration of
Admiralty House will be a memento to
Sydney of a well-loved Governor-General
and his lady.
And Sydney said its last, sad farewell
to the founder of the Borovansky Ballet
Company, Edouard Borovansky, who
died during the week. It was largely
through his influence that Australia has
become one of the most ballet-loving
countries in the world, and as his con-
tinuing memorial one sees the hundreds
of little girls practising in their toe-shoes
and their tu-tus, or reading of the life
of Anna Pavlova, or begging for a picture
of “Swan Lake” for their bedrooms, or
attending wide-eyed a performance of
“Sleeping Beauty,” who owe their know-
ledge and interest and love of ballet
so much to the influence of Edouard
Borovansky.
Nancy Cato, poet and novelist, whose
new book “Time, Flow Softly” has
arrived most opportunely at this present-
giving season, is well known to BULLETIN
readers for her verse and short stories.
Nancy Cato is in private life Mrs.
Eldred de B. Norman and is the
mother of three children. They live in
S.A., but Nancy Cato’s travels have
taken her to Italy, France and England,
in addition to the off-the-beaten-track
journeys to various parts of Australia,
which give her work vividness and
authenticity. The latest novel, a sequel
to her first, “All The Rivers Run," is set
in the Murray Valley. Our photo was
taken by K. C. Rainsford at a party
which her publishers, Heinemann’s, gave
in Adelaide to launch her new book.
Met a wide variety of interesting folk
at the Christmas-party of the Royal
Commonwealth Society. Members of the
Royal Navy were among those wel-
comed by president Ivan Black, M.L.A.,
and guests included Group-Captain
Paget and Mrs. Paget, Mr. Donald
Trounsen (U.K. Information Office), and
8.8. C. announcer Wilfred Thomas, who
has been with us for the past couple of
months arranging the Round-the-World
Christmas broadcast. Mr. Thomas said
that he was amazed at the changes that,
have taken place in Sydney since he was
last here nine years ago. (He also
promised us some surprises in the
Christmas broadcast). Many people were
making the party a happy preliminary
to further engagements, the L. A. Scotts
and the Harry Twigdens being among
those who went on to the concert of
Alfred Hill's music at the Town Hall,
at which the composer was honored by
the presentation of a laurel-wreath by
one of his former pupils, composer John
Antill.
☆ ☆ ☆
Mr. Justice Maxwell, president of the
Royal Blind Society, was allowed to
announce the amount of the cheque pre-
sented by the Black and White Ball
Committee at their champagne-party this
week, and he didn't seem able to believe
his eyes when he read it. However, the
sum was really £15,000 for the year’s
work —a record, needless to say.
☆ ☆ ☆
With no wish to introduce a sour note
into the festivities, one can't help com-
menting on the absence of Christmas
decorations in the streets of Sydney.
Most of the stores have concentrated
on interior tinsellating, and, to be frank,
some of them have overdone it. But
ihere’s scarcely a festoon or a Christmas-
tree to be seen all the way up George,
Pitt or Castlereagh Streets. As a matter
of fact, some of the suburbs —for
example, Top Ryde—look gayer than the
city itself.
☆ ☆ ☆
Of course, the Carols by Candlelight,
which this year drew 25,000 to Hyde
Park and many to church services
throughout the city, added considerably
to the Christmas atmosphere. That
twinkling of myriad lights in the summer
Sydney night (it was fine this year!)
is a very special Christmas-in-Australia
feature.
One cannot help thinking that Robert
Helpmann in his much-applauded
“Aladdin,” just opened in London, got
the idea of the “Palace of Light” where
all the children in the audience light a
match to produce a glittering illumina-
tion, from his Australian experience of
Carols by Candlelight. It must have been
a pretty sight, but the thought of hun-
dreds of children in a theatre each with
a lighted match in hand sends shivers
of apprehension down the spines of
parents, aunts, baby-sitters and the fire-
authorities.

Another note of farewell comes from
Toowoomba (Q.), where at the close of
the school-year came the end of a teach-
ing-career of more than half-a-century
for Toowoomba headmistress Miss A. M.
Wadley. Miss Wadley began teaching
when she was 14, and over the years
has become known and loved for her
work with the Girl Guides, the Y.W.C.A.
and as headmistress of South Girls and
Infants’ State School. She is remem-
bered as a comfort and a guiding light
to many.


vividly beautiful in literary expres-
sion.
(iii) Memoirs of Pioneers: There
are thousands of unpublished and
hundreds of published memoirs of
pioneers in the Mitchell Library, the
National Library at Canberra and the
various State libraries. An example
of these is Paving the Way, by Simp-
son Newland —recently reprinted. It
is partly in the guise of fiction, but it is
factual material. Among the many
others in this class I mention, almost
at random, Maty Fullerton’s Bark
House Days and Gordon Buchanan’s
Packhorse and Waterhole. There
would be no difficulty in finding at least
a hundred books of pioneers’ memoirs
which have literary as well as docu-
mentary interest for our proposed Aus-
tralian Classic Reprint Library.
(iv) History as Such: There are no
satisfactory conspective short histories
of all-Australia, the subject being too
great for all who have attempted it;
but there are many lucid studies of
special aspects of our history which
should be kept in print in a standard
series. These include biographies, such
as those by M. H. Ellis of Macquarie
and Macarthur, or by Marnie Bassett
of the Henty family, which achieve
more than mere documentation. Also,
in the Proceedings of the various
historical societies, and in official pub-
lications such as Historical Records of
Australia (unfortunately limited to the
convict period) and in the two
voluminous war histories there is a
vast amount of source-material, much
of it of undeniable literary merit. Yet
in general the professional historians
have been content to do the spadework
of unearthing facts. That leaves a
task, of interpreting those facts, to
literary workers who may be imagina-
tively inspired by love of country, or
by some other vision.
(v) Biographies: The “literary”
approach to biography requires not
only accurate documentation of the
subject and of the period background
but also something of the technique of
a novelist —that is, preservation of a
smooth narrative flow, and the psycho-
logical development of the central
character in relation to the classic
unities of time, place and action. To
classify the many already-published
Australian biographies as “literary” or
“non-literary” would be a fair task for
scholarly research; and it would yield
gleanings.
(vi) Autobiographies: In this field
a searcher would find some lively items.
In autobiography, as Jorgen Jorgensen
remarked, the writer is both Homer
and Agamemnon: the result is more
likely to be “literary” than docu-
mentary. This field partly overlaps
with Memoirs of the Pioneers. It
ranges from self-portraits of scallywags
such as Jorgensen to those of men of
serene merit, such as Sir Robert
Garran, whose recently - published
Prosper the Commonwealth is valu-
able both as documentation and as
literature.
(vii) Travel and Geographical
Description: This is one of the very
strongest classes of Australian factual
writing. It includes what may be called
“Northern-Territoriana”—a very wide
field, ranging from Mrs. /Eneas Gunn’s
We of the Never-Never to many better
books than that, such as Carl War-
burton’s Buffaloes; H. H. Finlayson’s
The Red Centre; Myrtle White’s No
Roads Go By; R. B. Plowman’s The
Man From Oodnadatta; Frank Clune’s
Overland Telegraph— and so on and
on. There are descriptive books of
literary merit referring to all parts of
Australia. For instance E. J. Ban-
field’s My Tropic Isle, and Jack
McLaren's two stylishly written works,
My Odyssey and My Crowded Soli-
tude. There would be no difficulty in
finding at least fifty works in this
category which should be kept in print.
(viii) Science: Some scientists have
learned how to write gracefully. I
quote as examples the late Professor
C. T. Madigan’s book Central Aus-
tralia; F. N. Ratcliffe’s Flying Fox and
Drifting Sand; C. F. Laseron’s The
Face of Australia; Alec H. Chisholm’s
Bird Wonders of Australia; Dr. C.
MacLaurin’s Post Mortem. Many
“Nature Books” are in print, and there
are some out of print which should be
revived, including A. G. Bolam’s
Trans-Australian Wonderland. It must
be recognised that scientists are
supremely dedicated to factual writing;
but many scientists have been grace-
ful writers. I cannot see why their
works should be arbitrarily excluded
from literary consideration.
(ix) Politics, Economics and
Sociology: One of Australia’s greatest
scholars and writers, the late Profes-
sor Vere Gordon Childe, in his book
How Labor Governs (published in
1927 in London) showed how literary
standards can be applied even to poli-
tical writings on Australian topics. I
feel, however, that most political writ-
ings are transient, or could be classi-
fied under “History” or “Biography.”
Yet there is no reason a priori why
THE FIRE
Do you see the match char, twist in your
fingers
Like a tortured witch ? A memory lingers
Of witches burning in every lit match :
The faggots are ready, and there is a
witch
For burning in our every fig of malice.
“Alice is a strange woman. Let us burn
Alice.
See what lies under her skin ; straw or
rags.
A fire burns every Saturday for such
hags.”
Alice was unlucky. Her sweet name
must rhyme with “malice”;
And that is why, in this poem, l burnt
Alice.
But she could have burned for much
less reason
In the days of real witches. This is no
treason
To the cause of burning witches. Zealots
would admire
Such casuistry, and howl, “Proceed with
the fire ! ”
But, imagine, if racing to her aid,
Sirens screaming, flashed a streamlined
fire-brigade.
Curtains of flame would drop, as if,
Suddenly, around her fell a cliff;
And Alice would cry, “Hold it!” which
means “Stop ! ”
Because the firemen made of her Joan-
of-Arc a flop.
Rather ludicrous, now, wouldn’t it be
To see Alice dripping in the ashes, and
set free
Instead of set aflame ? It would grieve
us to see a fire
Thus, and not our witch, ignobly expire
—ln those days, that is. A fire is feared
More than a witch, now ; and so we’re
geared
To cope with fires. Oh, how I tire
Of our extinguishing of fires. I fire
Imagination every time I light
A cigarette, for lamps in the night
—A dark night with black, lowering
cloud
And, huddled in heaps of rag, the
amorphous crowd.
Struggling, a girl screaming, bleeding,
half-naked, torn
By thorn-like fingers. Let the picture
warn
You, witches really acted before the
stake
To make your heart break. Now, you
quake
Before a fire, as if your sire took dam
Of some escaping witch. All that I am
Allowed, each Saturday, despite a
zealot’s itch,
To watch, within the fire, writhes in the
lit match.
Of fire we’re fearful, now, and not of
witches
—How grievously imagination stretches —
Some witch has slyly cursed our love of
fire.
Oh, when shall that spell break and we
admire
The writhing, lethal limbs of flame
Dancing with Alice, burning her for her
name,
Or any simpler reason zealots have
To make the good fire burn and Alice-
rave.
QUEENSLAND.

some writings in this field should not
survive as literature.
(x) Religion and Philosophy: These
are not “factual writings” in the
ordinary sense, even though theologians
and philosophers believe that they deal
in facts. In the nature of things, most
theologians and philosophers have a
literary education, and express them-
selves elegantly. In the field of religion,
apart from theology as such, there are
many factual books telling of Aus-
tralian church - history, missionary
enterprises and biographies of church-
men, and most of these have some
literary merit. An important early
Australian book in the field of religion
is Backhouse’s Narrative of a Visit to
the Australian Colonies, published in
London in 1841. He was a Quaker who
spent six years in Australia, 1832 to
1838, and made enlivening observa-
tions on what he saw.
(xi) Art: I suppose that art is a fact.
Many Australian artists have been
writers —among them Norman Lindsay
and Hardy Wilson. There are many
biographies of Australian artists, and
then there is William Moore’s great
work, The Story of Australian Art, in
two volumes, published in 1934, which
is definitely a literary factual work.
(xii) Jurisprudence: Lawyers are
usually dull writers—or so it seems to
the layman, when they write on law.
But they come into the field of litera-
ture when they write biographies or
autobiographies. A current example is
The Life of Chief Justice Way, by
A. J. Hannan. This is a factual work,
which is also “literary,” and there are
several other Australian legal books in
that genre.
(xiii) Sports and Amusements:
Scarcely anything is as dead -as dead
sport. When a game has been played
it is finished. But dozens of Australian
cricketers and other sportsmen have
written their reminiscences. Some of
these would be better classed as fiction
than as fact —but even that would not
make these works into literary classics.
Almost the only Australian sporting-
book that I know worthy of being kept
in print is H. C. A. Harrison’s Story of
an Athlete. He was the “father” of
Australian Rules Football.
(xiv) Aborigines: My last category,
Aborigines, should have been the first,
for they discovered Australia many
centuries, perhaps aeons, before the
Spaniards and the Dutch. But we have
no writings by aborigines. Instead
there are hundreds of books by white
men, descriptive of the aborigines. The
approach that I like best —from the
literary point of view—is that of
Spencer and Gillen, and also of H.
Basedow, and the recent lovely book
by Roland Robinson, The Feathered
Serpent. I feel that the works of the
modern professional anthropologists
are written mainly in a jargon which
has very little relation to literary
English.
Surely, then, in these fourteen fields
of factual writing in Australia, there is
scope for literary research to enlarge
the definition of Australian literature
beyond the conventional Eighteenth
and Nineteenth Century limits of
Poetry. Fiction, Drama and Belles
Lettres.

Reviewed Briefly
An Introduction to the Australian
Federal Parliament: “Prepared under
instructions from Senator the Hon. Sir
Alister McMullin, K.C.M.G.. president
of the Senate” (Angus and Robertson).
A useful, lucid and extremely dull
account of how the Federal Parliament
began and how it works, with addi-
tional chapters on Magna Carta and
the various royal visits to Australia.
(Review prepared under instructions
from the hon. the Religious Editor.)

From Baroque to Rococo: Nicolas
Powell (Faber). Essentially for the
specialist, this is an interpretation of
architecture in Switzerland, Germany
and Austria from 1580 when the first
Jesuit churches were built to 1780
when the Greek and Roman revival
began. It is handsomely produced with
many illustrations in black-and-white
and some exquisite plates in color.
* * * *
Young Man Luther: Erik H. Erikson
(Faber). A psychoanalytical study of
Luther, chiefly based on what is called
his “identity crisis” as a young man,
an “identity crisis” being the normal
disturbance of the mind in adolescence
which in some cases is “minimal” but
in Luther’s was large and severe—
“ Luther, so it seems, was a rather
endangered young man, beset with a
syndrome of conflicts.” Mixed with
the Freudian jargon is an interesting
account of Luther’s career, particularly
in his Augustinian monastery, and
some illuminating asides on such sub-
jects as James Joyce and “our bottom-
less incredulity in the face of Russian
trials or Chinese reforms.”

The Story of Australia: P. R. Smith
and B. Biro (Bennj. Handsomely
illustrated in color by Biro, this is a
brief history written by a senior master
at Melbourne Church of England
Grammar School: aborigines. Cook,
convicts, wheat, wool, gold, explora-
tion, etc., up to the end of World War
11. It has an introduction by R G.
Menzies and is presumably intended
for migrants and schoolchildren.

Collected Poems: Gerald Bulled
(Dent). Gerald Bullett was typically a
Georgian poet, influenced by Frost and
Blunden. Though he has not the nutti-
ness (if the term is polite enough) of
the one, nor the depth of the other,
he wrote a pleasant kind of verse in
which you can enjoy simultaneously
the charm of the English countryside
and the charm of his personality.
“Man and Hare,” for instance:—
I stopt the car. Herself, with side-
long look,
Sat in the lighted circle, ears
a-cock.
Like harvest moons new fallen from
the sky
My headlamps must have seemed to
her slant eye:
In whose warm skin, seeing them so.
I sat,
And wondered what the world
would now be at.

Xelahuh: Friedrich Morton, trans-
lated from the German by Otto
Eisner (Hollis and Carter). Travels in
Guatemala with an eye on Nature and
archeology. On one page Morton
has 25 rattlesnakes coiled together in a
heap in the moonlight—“like a fabu-
lous beast with a multitude of broad
heads, all hissing and rattling”—
followed by two gold idols hidden
under a tree, so he certainly gives good
value for your money.
