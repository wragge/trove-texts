Songs from Jail
When the United States entered the big
war Ralph Chaplin was sentenced to 20
years’ imprisonment for obstructing the
national effort. He was the editor _ of.
Solioakity, the official organ of the I.W.W.
in America. While in prison—he is still
there—he wrote the verses which have just
been published by George Allen and Unwin
under the title Bars and Shadows, What-
ever Vie\v we may take of the activities of
the 1.W.W., and whether we regard their
leaders as malicious criminals, mistaken
enthusiasts or farsighted visionaries, there
can be but one opinion of the poetic achieve-
ment of Ralph Chaplin. There is scarcely
a stronger or clearer voice in American
literature to-day. This is the more notable
from the fact that Chaplin follows well-estab-
lished forms of verse and modes of expres-
sion. He is no freak singer, but in the
genuine succession from Milton, Keats and
Shelley. He does not wish to be known as
a poet, claiming that the movement to which
he belongs must make its own literature and
its own art, but his poetic sense has, never-
theless, accepted the realities of song, and
he seeks neither by-ways nor short-cuts. The
sonnet is his favorite medium, and he chooses
his words with a full feeling for their- values
and a just sense of their beauty. He has
the rebel heart of a Shelley and the eagerness
to speak of a Lowell; but his emotion is
never allowed to run mad except in a few
fiei’cc outpourings that were intended to stir
a revolutionary madness in the crowd.
A voice like this must be heard in spite
of all pi-ison walls:
They say we are revolters —-that we stirred
The workers of all nations to rebel— ™
And that we would not compromise with Hell,
But damned it with our every deed and word.
They feared us as we faced them undeterred,
And gave us each a coffin of a cell
In this steel cave where living corpses dwell—-
Hate-throttled here that we might not be heard.
We are those fools too stubborn-willed to bend
Our necks to Wrong and parley and discuss.
To-day we face the awful test of fire —
The prison, gallows, cross—but in the end
Your sons will call your children after us
And name their dogs from men you now admire.
Had the young Milton been living in modem
America and hy some strange accident been
thrown into the camp of the I.W.W. he
might have written just that.
But Chaplin sings in many moods. Here
is another sonnet, “Night in the Cell House” :
Tier over tier they rise to dizzy height—
The cells of men who know the world no more.
Silence intense from ceiling to the floor;
While through the window gleams a lone blue light
Which Stabs the dark immensity of night.
Kelt-shod and ghostly like a shade of yore,
The guard comes shuffling down the corridor;
His key-ring jingles. .. .and he glides from sight.
Oh, to forget the prison and its scars,
And face the breeze where ocean meets the land;
To watch the foam-erests dance with silver stars,
While long green waves come tumbling on the
sand....
My brow is hot against the icy bars;
There is the smell of iron on my hand.
In “To My Little Son” there is a heart-
break the more poignant for the utter sim-
plicity of the setting:
I cannot lose the thought of you,
It haunts me like a little song,
It blends with all I see or do
Each day, the whole day long.
The train, the lights, the engine’s throb,
And that one stinging memory;
Your brave smile broken with a sob,
Your face pressed close to me.
Lips trembling far too much to speak;
The arms that would not come undone;
The kiss so salty on your cheek;
The long, long trip begun.
I could not miss you more, it seemed,
But now I don't know what to say,
It’s harder than I ever dreamed
With you so far away.
“The Warrior Wind” shows the poet in
another change of mood. Here are two
stanzas:
The wind alone, of all the gods of old,
Men could not chain.
O wild wind, brother to my wrath and pain,
Like you, within a restless heart I hold
A hurricane.
The wind has known the dungeons of the past,
Knows all that are;
And in due time will strew their dust afar.
And, singing, he will shout their doom at last
To a laughing .star.
It seems a pity that “in due time” should
introduce a note of commonplace among the
nig gusts. As if wind had any due time or
season 1
Chaplin is far too strong a man to stay
behind prison bars, for a spirit like his
must soar above steel and stone. But‘per-
haps the future may have a word of thanks
for the rough jxjstice which brought out the
qualities of the singei\ If prison cannot
hold him it is very certain that the I.W.W.
movement is tbb narrow for his real energies.
D. M. W.
A King in Exile
E. T. Raymond, the author of Mr.
Lloyd George: A Biography (Collins, pub-
lishers), is already known for his “Uneen-
sored Celebrities” and for a cynical bio-
graphy of Arthur Balfour. He has plenty
ot prejudices, and makes no hypocritical
pretences to the contrary. The fact is, no
political biographer can treat his subject
with absolute impartiality where hie has
known that subject. A'nd indeed this is as
it should be. Posterity wants to know
how the hero or the villain affected the
people of his time. It is far more import-
ant for our grandchildren to learn that
Lloyd George was for years regarded in
the exclusive clubs of Britain as a cad and
a bounder than to be told that he won the
Great War. The very qualities that made
him appear a cad and a bounder to that
section which lives according to the Confn-
cian formula were the qualities that made
him the instrument of victory. A century
from now the Great War will not occupy
more than a dozen pages or so in the his-
tory books. Lloyd George’s name will be
there, but to learn what manner of man he
Was the student will ifted to go to the
great libraries and pull down E. T. Ray-
mond’s and other biographies of him.
No ope who reads this work would be-
lieve that its subject is one of the most
attractive of public men in the world. The
truth is that Lloyd George is very human,
because he is so extremely interested in
everyone and everything. Bonar Law once
complained to him that life was very tiring.
‘'Yes,” replied the ex-Premier, “but it is
awfully interesting.” Unequally educated, ill
road rather than unread, he has very dis-
tinct sympathies and antipathies. Le has
no use for highbrows. He literally does
not comprehend them. He has less use for
the upper-middle class, to whom he at-
taches all the obloquy he associates with the
landed gentry who spoilt his youth. He is
extremely emotional, and probably has
talked more cant than any other politician
alive, possibly excluding some of the Bolshe-
vist leaders. He claims inherent sympathy
with the under-dog, and certainly his pre-
war schemes of Social reform may have been
instinct with the desire to aid suffering
humanity. On the other hand there is
equally good evidence that they were instinct
with a wish to even up an old account.
He is very, vain. He is no respecter
of persons. He has no reverence for birth
or position. He has a respect for wealth,
not for what it is, but for what it can do.
He is lacking ip the courtesy of gratitude,
and even more so in generosity. He is a
family man, and his personal tastes are
simple.
His greatness lies in the “marvellous
accuracy of his intuitions.” Some call it
guesswork, and some call it luck, but he
has the happy knack of recognising what
the people want, not for all time, or even
for a long time, But for the time being.
As E. T. Raymond puts it, he has an
almost infallible nose for what stockbrokers
call a quick rise or a sudden slump. He
knows how the political market is going,
not next year or the yea'r after, but next
week and perhaps a week or two ahead.
His next outstanding political asset is his
flexibility, which is so infinite as to have
earned him the charge of having ho politi-
cal principles at all. He can “put on a
new soul as other men put on a new shirt.”
The result of this facility is that he can,
and does, extend his influence over every
kind of politician, and to such effect that
those widest apart believe in him with equal
sincerity. Conversely, he is distrusted and
disbelieved by as many and as varied classes.
Raymond is at some pains to liken his
career to that of Diocletian, and indeed
there are many parallels. In the plenitude
of his power the Welsh autocrat of Britain
also had much in common in manner and
in methods with the Prussian autocrat of
Germany. Both in high degree lacked the
spirit of loyalty to colleagues; both are
incapable of understanding finance; Both
have an absurd reverence for supermen, so
long as the limelight is not shared ; and both
have an immense power of emotional appeal.
The mere fact of Lloyd George’s imperish-
able services to the Empire does little to
explain him. A great Premier, even a very
great Premier, is the title to which those
services entitle him; but no biography can
fully explain how and why he was so suc-
cessful unless it takes into the fullest
account the spirit of England during the war.
While Lloyd George won the war, he did
it as the instrument of Britain, which put
into his hand the power and the will to
win. It trusted the man, and because of
that trust was willing to sacrifice every- *
thing to make victory certain. But while
the people trusted, the classes did not. Lime-
house still rankled with many. To no small
extent it is true that victory was delayed at
least a year because Lloyd George did not
have, and could not get, that full control
which he knew was essential, which every-
one knew was desirable, but which some
were afraid to grant. Private feelings
accounted for much of this, but tradition
accounted for more. The little Welsh
“bounder” realised that a candle had to be
held to the devil. And he was just the
man to do it, but right up to the disaster
of March, 1918, influence prevented the
candle being held close enough.
In all respects this biography will be
found able and stimulating. The style is
attractive, and the writer has a flair for
the right word. As to many of its judgments
the opinion of the reader will vary with
the reader’s political opinions. The mosaic
is not a pretty one, but the centre is ex-
cellent, and the more attractive for the
defects of its surroundings. Raymond has
not written the last word about Lloyd
George, by many volumes, any more than
Bonar Law, of the “quietist” election, has
put “finis” to his political career. Dynamic
energy cannot be bottled up, and the ex-
Premier is the incarnation of dynamic energy
—an incarnation Only equalled probably
by one whom, but for the grace of God
and the electorate of the Carnarvon Boroughs,
he might have greatly resembled, Lenin, of
Moscow. That he will come back is certain
enough, but such are the eccentricities of
his mind that whether it will be as a
Liberal, or as a Tory or as a Lahor mem-
ber is open to doubt. A man without
settled conviction will accept almost any
stairway that leads to power, and poweV
in very large capitals is the obsession of
the ex-Premier.
A. P.
William Hazlitt
A new life of Hazlitt by R. P. Howe
rouses fresh interest in a personality that
every journalist regards with affection. It
is not quite a hundred, years since Hazlitt,
author, essayist and newspaper man—-but,
above all, newspaper man—wrote his last
copy for the London Examiner, and died
with the ink scarcely dry on his fingers. This
was in September, 1830; lie had completed
521 years of unusually busy life. He died
in furnished lodgings, and it was in fur-
nished lodgings, getting a shade cheaper and
dingier as time went on, that he had spent
the greater part of his adult existence. The

LAUNDRENA
“The Dainty Womans
Favourite Starch”
stands supreme in the eyes of fastidious
women. It is made from unadulterated
maize which adds a satiny smooth finish
and crisp daintiness to every washable
fabric, never impairing the finest texture
or the most delicate colourings.
Laundrena Starch goes into solution rapidly and
easily without leaving any gritty sediment or sticky
lumps to hamper the speed and success of ironing.
As well as being satisfactory in every way for
either heavy or light washing, Laundrena is
particularly economical in use, going considerably
further than an ordinary rice starch.
See that your Laundress uses it.

fact does something to explain him, both
mentally and temperamentally. The tin
gods of respectability were not for him ; he
had other things to think about. He lived
in a world of letters, a world not absolutely
apart—there were rare souls as comrades —
but yet a world into which the suburban
ideals of a home of one’s own, and furniture
of one’s own, did not enter. And he had
the courage to die as he had lived: “Well,
I have had a happy life,” he said as he turned
to the wall. A magnificent rebuke that to
. the whiners who recognise nothing but
material values.
The latest biographer goes into details
about much that is of doubtful interest now.
Century-old differences with editors _ and
critics, feuds with fellow-Bohemians,
opinions of second-rate plays and actors are
hardly the stuff with which to make a
literary sensation, if Mr. Howe is looking-
for one—which evidently he is not. What
he does effectively is to call back from semi-
oblivion a number of people whom the read-
ing world does not want to forget. Hazlitt
knew practically every writer of his time
who was worth knowing. Coleridge, Words-
worth, Lamb, Southey, Campbell, Leigh
Hunt and others were his intimates; Shelley
and Keats he had met, and Byron and Scott,
the two literary pets of society, were only
less known to him because they moved in
a different and more expensive set. But in
his articles on Contemporary Poets he has
dealt with them all and drawn pen-pictures
of them all. It was part of the supreme
talent of Hazlitt that he could draw from
life with a fidelity and insight that was the
next thing to creation. He has had thou-
sands of journalistic successors in that line,
but scarcely an equal and certainly no
superior.
The man himself is a deeply interesting
study. His contemporaries, with one or
two exceptions, did not like him, and he did
not seem to care whether they did or not.
He is interesting because in a world largely
dominated by snobbery and privilege and
social shams of all sorts he dared to be him-
self, to say what he wanted to say, to follow
what he thought worth following, to damn
what he thought needed damning. And
there were a terrible lot of things in that
last category. The son of a Nonconformist
clergyman, and a painter in early youth, he
drifted inevitably to journalism. In 1812,
at the age of 34, he went to London and
began his real life’s work. He was already
married and had one child; but it was not
long before his wife, who had all Lady
Byron’s objection to irregular living, found
her way back to relatives in the country.
Hazlitt went on alone. He found regular
employment with the Chronicle, for which
he wrote dramatic criticisms and articles on
general subjects. He also represented that
paper in the gallery of the House of Com-
mons. He wrote highbrow stuff and hack
stuff with equal facility, taking things as
they came, and satisfied if the landlady was
not too exigent and the brand of tea was
up to the standard. Never careful of his
health, he would sit for hours of a morning
drinking strong tea and idling over papers
and magazines. The night usually found
him in a city cafe or restaurant, from which
he came home late to the chill solitude of
the furnished room.
The great abiding merit of Hazlitt is his
absolute literary sincerity. He had other
things, too, of course —charm of style, gift of
expression, keen power of analysis—but he
lives a century after his death mainly be-
cause he saw “the knightly truth.” He
would probably have made a lot more money by
pandering; but he pandered to nobody. When
the Chronicle failed him he found other
vehicles of expression. The ultra-respectable
editors of the Times and the Edinburgh
Review, to their credit be it said, were glad
to find a place for him in their columns.
They might not agree with his views on
Pitt and the Revolution, but they knew a
writer of real distinction when they saw
one. And between them these editors and
proprietors have conferred on Hazlitt the
laurel wreath of immortality. They gave
him the chance to say what he wanted to
say. In their columns he wrote his Con-
temporary Portraits, his Characters of Shaks-
peare’s plays, his discursive articles and his
Collected Miscellanies —a volume of work
that endures by reason of its wide and
catholic range, its gift of description, its
illuminative touches, its clear and suggestive
thought.
As for Hazlitt the man, his whole outlook
on life is thrown on the screen when he comes
to deal with the typical politician and the
typical journalist of his day. Thus he says
of Pitt, the god of the bourgeois and the
idol of the upper classes, that he was “with-
out insight into human nature, without sym-
pathy with the passion of men or apprehen-
sion of their real designs.” And this is how
he threw his challenge in the teeth of Gifford,
editor of the Quarterly—the man who was
credited with having killed Keats, and who
described Hazlitt’s best work as “loathsome
trash”: —-
He cannot go alone. He hates those who pretend
to a greater reach of intellect or boldness of spirit
than himself. He inclines by a natural and delibe-
rate bias to the traditional in laws and govern-
ment, to the orthodox in religion, to the safe in
opinion, to the trite in imagination, to whatever
implies a surrender of individual judgment into
the hands of authority and a subjection of individual
feeling to mechanic rules.
There is nothing violent or intemperate
there —but it exactly sums up the type of
mind that lovers of- intellectual beauty have
always been up against, and that they will
always be up against until the end of time.
Are there no big papers and no poli-
ticians in these days who incline “by a
natural and deliberate bias” to the “trite in
imagination” and the “safe in opinion” ? Is it
not a fact that the safe man, the man who
“surrenders his individual judgment into the
hands of authority,” is the man whom
authority prefers now and on whom all its
rewards are still lavished? The little circle
of beauty lovers can sing if it likes
We are the music makers
And we are the drcnmers of dreams:
but it has still got .to stand down when
the big prizes are given out. Ihe virtue
of Hazlitt, understanding virtue in the
Roman sense of courage, was that he saw
what he was giving up and did not mmd.
The serried ranks of Suburbia had no terrors
for him. Unsuccessful in money matters,
lonely in life, unhappy in his love affairs—
Sarah Walker jilted him, his first wile
divorced him, and the second left him ne
flung himself into the world of ideas, made
rare minds his companions, and died content.
ALFREDB BUCHANAN.
Freedom and the Churches
The Rev. H. O’Laverty, 8.A., sets out to
prove, in Christ versus Capitulistn (Pel-
legrini and Co.), that the Roman Catholic
Church is, and always has been, the demo-
cratic church, the church of the down-
trodden. He credits Catholicism with the
abolition of slavery, the foundation of all
freedom: —
When the church began its mission of uplifting
society throughout the Roman Empire there were
14,000,000 of slaves within the boundaries of the
Roman dominions. By the teaching of the church
alone, and without wars and bloodshed, all these
slaves were set free. ... The church was so consis-
tent in her teaching that, in spite of all the power
of a strong empire, the logical conclusion of her
doctrines was that slavery was incompatible with
the following of the gospel of Christ, and public
opinion was so formed that slavery was abolished.
Christianity was undoubtedly a poor man’s
creed, a slave’s creed —until Constantine’s
reign. The Christians taught communism
and equality, which was what made them
as unpopular with the upper-class pagans of
the period as the Mennonites, who taught
similar doctrines, became in the 16th cen-
tury amongst aristocratic Catholics. How-
ever, from the moment Christianity emerged
as a State church its hatred of wealth and
its scorn of power began to fade.
It would take a bold man to argue that
the lot of an English serf was any pleasanter
after 10 centuries of Catholicism than that
of a slave in the reign of Augustus. It is
true that the best elements in the church
sought constantly to ameliorate the condi-
tion of the slaves ; but under the Empire it
did not condemn slave-owning as _ contrary
to Christian sentiment, while Justinian has
a better claim to the credit of having made
slavery more tolerable. In mediaeval Europe
the church did nothing of value for free-
dom in this direction. Spaniards, Portu-
guese, Venetians and French all brought
armies of slaves from Africa, under abomin-
able conditions, either for their personal
use, or for re-selling purposes, without pro-
voking the fulminations of the Papacy. It
is a significant fact that the African slave-
trade was actually given its quietus by a
little coterie of Methodists. And this brings
us to the point that the Methodist Church,
if any, has a right to the claim which Father
O’Laverty makes for Catholicism. The ori-
ginal Methodists went back to primitive
Christianity, and in many respects this sect
teaches primitive precepts still. The Metho-
dists believe in the spiritus privatus, which
went out for a dozen centuries with the in-
stitution of a State Christian church. As
a result they have no steeply-graded hier-
archy. They preach simplicity of worship,
and so have no magnificent cathedrals. They
have never recognised the divine right of
kings, which is one reason why there have
been no Methodist sovereigns and few Meth-
odists of title.
But the truth is it is absurd to generalise
on this subject. Politically, Catholicism is
the kaleidoscope it has always been. In
France it is aristocratic in the Faubourg
St. Germain, and democratic at St. Malo.
The typical English Catholic priest is a
Morning Post Tory, and the typical Irish
one a Manchester Guardian Radical.
Here, because Catholicism is largely the reli-
gion of the poor, the church is as radical as
any institution can be which is based on
order, on a dislike of change and on the main-
tenance of privilege. Similarly, because
Methodists are more affluent here than in
Pie country where Methodism originated, we
&ten find the Methodist Church in Aus-
tralia leaning towards Conservatism —an
attitude it has never adopted in England.
What it all amounts to is that, politically
and sociologically, every church reflects its
age and environment. None of the churches
in the days when Calvinists were burning
Catholics, and vice versa, had the enlight-
ened views in regard to freedom of con-
science which every church professes to-day.
If more people grasped this truism —that the
ethics of all the churches have ever been
the ethics of given historical p.eriods—we
might have less of that form of false logic
which consists in proving a church good or
bad by reference to its activities several cen-
turies ago.
D.
Arranging a Scoop
In 1911, while residing in Brighton
(Eng.), the editor of a local rag whispered
to me one day that the poet Stephen
Phillips was living in a slum house ad-
joining Ship-street. His condition, the editor
confided, was one of destitution and misery.
Now, although I had never exhibited a
frenzied interest in the author of “Paolo
and Francesca,” “Christ in Hades,” and
“Nero,” I was conscious of Phillips’s place
in the sun. And my amazement deepened
when I reflected on the social state of
affairs that permitted him to hide his sick
and weary body in a Sussex slum. Only a
little whiie before I had seen him at one of
the London theatres, playing the Ghost
to Sir Frank Benson’s Hamlet. He had
put more melancholy into his lines than
Shakspeare ever intended, no doubt. But
it was the most memorable Ghost I ever
saw.
My anger against the people who allowed
Stephen Phillips to starve w T as, however,
soon tempered by the knowledge that I had
been supplied with a first-class international
news stunt. Charles Goddard, editor-in-chief
of the New York American, was buying
a lot of my stories and news matter. An
exclusive message outlining the poet’s
plight in England would tickle him im-
mensely. He was then running a syndicate of
Sunday Specials from the Duane-street
office. The Phillips story, if true, would
mean pages for his Specials and panic head-
lines for his big morning paper. Also, I did
not lose sight of my own headlines, and
the fact that it had been left to an Aus-
tralian writer to give shelter to one of
England’s destitute master-singers! The
memory of poor John Davidson’s end still
rankled in me.
It was a night when the rain squalls
of the Atlantic seemed to be tearing up the
asphalt of the Brighton sea front. Fisher-
men in sou’-westers blundered against the
indriving blasts of brine and sand. I asked
Leo, my wife, to make a fire in the spare
room and put the children to bed. I was
going to bring home a poor friend. He
would be hungry and tired, no doubt. And
if the copy of “Christ in Hades” was
available, would Leo kindly place it near the
fire where my poor friend mio-ht recognise
a cry from the past?
Walking hastily to the nearest telegraph
office I wired the Weekly Dispatch that
I was on for the scoop of the year. I
added: “Poet S.P. destitute here. Paolo —
Francesca. Am investigating.”
Outside, the wind blew me into Ship-
street and down the next. I began a house-
to-house canvass that revealed to me the
unforgettable horrors of the seaside slums.
I have often propounded the theory that the
soul of the newsgetter resides somewhere
between his brain and his nose. After a
thirty-minutes’ hunt I was attracted by an
unlyrical aroma of frying bloaters that
emerged from an entry lit by an iron gas-
lamp. It was probably the smell of bloaters
that first reached Shakspeare when he
wandered back to Anne Hathaway’s cottage
at Stratford after a bit of play-acting in
London. The bloaters did it in my case.
From a door that looked out on the dark
stone entry an old crone was watching
me, a guttering candle held over her head.
I begged her attention for a moment, while
I put the question that I had been asking
dozens of other slum denizens. Could she
guide me to the person of one Stephen
Phillips, a tall, actor-like man from Lon-
don? In other words, a gentleman down
on his luck.
There was grime and kindliness in the old
crone’s face as she replied. “A gent, by
name of Phillips was staying with me
until an hour ago, sir. He had no luggage,
and no money, except the shilling he gave
me for the room, poor dear! He coughed
the whole of last night. I sent my little
Rosalie to the chemist to get him some
drops; but they was shut—they always is,
sir!”
“But where is he now?” I inquired with
some impatience. “Can you tell me where
he has gone?
The old woman sheltered the candle with
her hand as she replied. “He went away
an hour ago, sir. A car with two gents
from Rottingdean took him off. I did hear
one of the gent.’s names; it sounded like
Tionling!”
“Kipling!” I suggested with a sinking
feeling under my waistcoat.
Her face beamed instantly. “That’s it,
sir; Mr. Kipling. Dark gent.; fur coat
an’ specs. Mr. Phillips went back to Rotting-
dean with him, sir. I’m sorry you missed
him !”
I returned home and, taking refuge in the
spare room where Leo had placed “Christ
in Hades” on the mantel, above the fire,
I devoured the book, seeking certain pas-
sages that were almost equal to my own
emotions in their sublimity of expression
and power of execration.
ALBERT DORRINGTON.
A Satchel of Books
Ovington’s Bank, by Stanley J. Weyman (John
Murray). A sincere piece of work, but dull, and
the characters are unconvincing’. It deals with the
conventional struggle between trade, in the persons
of banker Ovington and his family, and landed
property, represented by Squire Griffin of Garth. A
love-affair between children of both houses entangles
them, and a scion of the old Garth family is only
prevented from ruining his august relative by the
endeavors of the despised banking firm. There is
the run-on-the-bank scene, apparently inevitable in
a novel of the period of England’s industrial revolu-
tion, and many pastoral pictures apd much cross-
country coaching. But it is unfortunate that all
the big scenes should recall others. A good school
prize, though it will not add anything to Weyman’s
reputation.
Love and Life, by Louise Heilgers (Cecil Palmer).
A collection of snappy sketches which deal mostly
with love and London. Just the book to provide a
migrant West End shop-assistant with a mildly
pleasant nostalgia.
My Years on the Stage, by John Drew (Dutton).
Pew Australians ever saw John Drew on the stage,
for he is one of those American actors who rarely
appeared outside the U.S.A.; nevertheless, his book
should carry a fairly wide appeal. It is the work
of a simple old gentleman (his stories and jokes are
incredibly poor) who all his busy life had obviously
but one pre-occupation—his profession. Though
the style is bald and halting, and though he never
by any chance says anything bright or dramatic, he
yet manages to convey a good deal of the charm
which he no doubt put across the footlights. The
book is primarily a record of the doings of the Drew
family from the date of his own first appearance at
Philadelphia, in 1873, to the present day, and it is
profusely embellished.
The Eight Strokes of the Clock, by Maurice
Leblanc (Cassell). Gory detective yarns by a speci-
alist in the gruesome craft. Some of the lady mur-
derers are perfectly thrilling, but the male homicides
are an ordinary lot.
“Indiscretions” of Lady Susan (Thornton, Butter-
worth) is an apologia, in the form of one of those
volumes of reminiscences which are selling Bo well
in England just now. Lady Susan Towneley was
accused in the House of Commons by Horatio Bot-
tomley of having been a member of a reception
committee to the ex-liaiser while her husband was
British Minister to the Netherlands. She denied it
at the time, and she does so again in her book ; but
Sir Walter Towneley was retired, with a result which
she briefly and bitterly notes: —
“We are now living in the country and breeding
Large Black pigs, which, if not quite so interesting,
is at least more remunerative and less exacting than
Diplomacy.”
The rest of the work consists of an entertaining
series of sketches of the pre-war life of the great
in Germany, Portugal, China, the U.S.A. and else-
where. She is a shrewd and outspoken observer.
The following will have a homelike flavor to many
Australians:—
“In New York one is always aware of the social
striving of women. One sees the wheels whirring
that keep the clock going. There is nothing they
love so much as the entertaining of a real live
prince. Nor is a lesser foreign light in the shape
of a duke or even a ‘stranger of distinction’ to
be despised.... One lady cleverer than the rest out-
manoeuvres her sisters, and secures the prince (I
call him so for the want of a better name). The
next thing is to entertain him. Lists are con-
sulted and ruthlessly cut down. Then the telephone
begins to work. Oh, how anxiously that telephone
bell is being listened for, especially by aspirants
to pre-eminence whose position is still undefined,
but whose value may be finally determined by in-
clusion in these parties!”
Substitute for “prince” or “stranger of distinc-
tion” some visitor of very much lighter social
tonnage, and you have the identical situation which
periodically convulses Sydney and Melbourne.


COUNTRY HOUSE & FARM LIGHTING SETS
There are many satisfactory House-lighting
Plants from which to choose, but, to ensure
satisfaction, you should specify that the
Battery which accompanies the plant you
select must be a Tudor.
The Tudor Battery will last longer, and will
keep you free from the worries that are
known to the owners of less reliable batteries.
When trouble is experienced with House-
lighting Plants it is usually battery trouble.
Eliminate these worries by insisting that your
Battery be a Tudor.
Tudor Batteries are designed and built to give
a maximum life at a minimum expenditure
for maintenance. More than fifty municipali-
ties and town councils in Australia have
installed Tudor Batteries in their Lighting
Stations.
The Tudor Accumulator Co., Ltd.
(London), maintains its own staff
of Battery Engineers and fitters in
Australia, and is at all times at

“Satisfied
Just to Keep the Wolf from the Door.
THIS is the story of a man
into whose satisfied soul
the Alexander Hamilton
Institute brought divine discon-
tent.
May it be read by every man
in Australia whose position and
income are no better to-day
than they were last year.
“A few years ago I occupied
a position as manager of a
branch of a large corporation in
a city of some 50,000 inhabi-
tants,” the man writes. ‘‘This
job I had held for five years,
during which there had been no
advancement for me in the way
of remuneration or otherwise.”
(One single year without advancement
ought to be a danger-signal to
any ambitious man.)
“My duties, however, were not
arduous, and as I was paid a
salary that kept the wolf from
the door I was fairly well satis-
fied with my lot. Through the
efforts of one of your representa-
tives, the Modern Business
Course and Service was placed
before me; I took up the study
of it and, after continuing for
three months,
“I began to wake up.
‘‘The fact was dawning upon
me that I had been and was in a
rut. After consulting with a
member of the Alexander Ham-
ilton Institute staff who favored
the change, I started at the very
bottom with the concern on
whose stationery this letter is
written. My advancement has
been gradual, until at present I
am secretary of the company, a
member of the Board of Direc-
tors, and have charge of the
advertising and selling activi-
ties . . . . ”
The concern is the largest
manufacturer of shoes in its
territory.
The letter is too long to quote
in full; but you will note that the
Institute representative who
accepted this man’s enrolment
was not satisfied to let the
matter rest there. He counselled
with him about finding a differ-
ent job; he advised him step by
step just how to make his train-
ing count. This is what Alex-
ander Hamilton Institute service
means; it is one of the reasons
why thousands of successful
executives are so enthusiastic in
their praise of the Institute’s
value in their careers.
You are paying for this training
whether you receive it or not.
All through these years when
he was “keeping the wolf from
the door,’’ and was “fairly well
satisfied with his lot’’ the writer
of this letter was paying a
terrific price for what the Alex-
ander Hamilton later brought to
him; paying in opportunities that
passed him by because he had
not the knowledge and self-
confidence to make them his
own; paying in years of no
salary increase, when the in-
crease might have been swift
and sure.
And you, too, are paying.
You know in your own heart
how big a man you are. You
have set a figure which you be-
lieve will some day represent
your value in the business world.
If you are a £ 1000 man in
your own estimation and work-
ing for £ 500, then you are paying
£5OO a year for what the Alex-
ander Hamilton Institute has to
give. If your mark is £2OOO
and your salary is only £7OO,
then you are paying £ 1 300.
Isn’t it too much to pay for the
failure to investigate? Is it fair
to your wife and children to put
off year after year the realisa-
tion of the hopes that might be
fulfilled now?
Send for this book of success.
All the facts a b out the
Modern Business Course and
Service and the answers to every
question you are likely to ask are
contained in a 120-page book,
“Forging Ahead in Business.’’ It
is a valuable addition to any
business library, yet you can

Messrs. Beale and Company Ltd.,
gentlemen,
c ßefore leaving on my trip to the Old Coun-
try, Ifeel that I would like you to know how much
pleasureithasgiven me to perform on your pianos
which I have had occasion to do many times in
public. In particular, the tone-quality is excel-
lent—a sonorous bass with a brilliant treble,
making a well-balanced combination that is
unsurpassed by pianos of foreign origin.
Altogether you are to be congratulated on the
many excellent qualities displayed in such a
purely Australian product as the Beale Piano.
IVishing you all the success you deserve,
Yours faithfully,

SUBTLE and delicate—Mr. Evans’ playing is a prodigy of
intellectual interpretation and sympathetic technique. Deeply
emotional, he treats accompanying as the serious art it really is
judging every nuance precisely, in order that the clearness and
timbre of the voice shall be preserved utterly. In fact, his reading
of songs is so refreshingly original that one can readily understand
the enthusiasm with which Dame Melba secured his services for
her trip abroad.
His opinion of a piano is doubly interesting, for in addition to
the ordinary dynamic demands of the virtuoso he requires also
an unusually flexible and responsive action. Above is his letter
concerning the "New Beale Piano.

Remodelled.
There is a ruined mansion in my mind
Fitted with ghostly rooms, where, hand in
hand,
When midnight capers on the moonlit land,
Wraiths up the staks in grim procession
wind.
Some are so small, I pity them to find
How, as they climb at a lost dream’s com-
mand,
They turn together shaking back the sand
Of other days that I have left behind.
It clears my vision, and I see again
The things that might have been, the deeds
undone,
The idle nights of years I chose to roam
Far from its shuttered windows. Sick with
pain,
I break the rotted walls, let in the sun,
And build above the wreck my soul’s true
home.

Books are for houses where confining walls
Cloister the plodding mind; beyond the
doors
Such vital beauty on the spirit pours
The halting grope of scholarship appals;
Words wilt and fade when living glory falls
On kingly hills, they shrink when the storm
roars,
No phrase can follow where the eagle soars
Nor paint how midnight walks her spark-
ling halls.
There is no volume but the throbbing sea
Dwarfs its thin wisdom into childishness,
No poem but the clouds aloof and free
Mock its constraint, for the wide sky allows
Fancies to break that speech can never house,
Thought to glimpse heights no language
can express.

In the Little Hours.
The clocks strike three; the city sleeps,
Its doors shut fast, its windows dark ;
Night, lord of all, majestic, keeps
Dominion over street and park.
Dew falls, a soft, dank dew that damps
The long, black pavements stretching far;
Stars burn above, beneath are lamps,
Each lamp a still, white, watchful star.
High parapets to left and right
Loom darkly up against the sky; ;
Around the lamps are pools of light
Wherein maimed moths and beetles lie.
A gust that blows from salty tides
That move along a dirging coast
Sweeps moaning by, and then subsides
Like some drowned sailor’s homing ghost.
Around about a something dwells—
A something strange that sleepless lies.
The streetside lamps are sentinels.
The windows all are watching eyes.
In street and square the soul of Night
Dim, vaguely felt, moves everywhere;
Eyes, watchful eyes, to left and right
The windows through the darkness stare.
The clocks strike four; the east lights up,
Star after star retires, withdrawn
By Night, and from her glowing cup
Day spills the golden wine of dawn.

The Valley.
As I went through the valley
I met nor man nor lad,
For all were in the market-place
A-selling all they had.
The birds and winds w T ere calling.
But none were there who heard.
For better was the chime of gold
Than song of wind or bird.
Young lads with eyes that hungered,
And old men pinched of face,
A-buying and a-selling all,
They thronged the market-place.
All voiceful was the valley
With warblers, thrushes, wrens ;
Its flowers were little laughing folk,
Its trees tall citizens.
The buyers and the sellers,
Grey age and youth abloom,
They trod upon each other’s toes
And fought for elbow-room.
They had no time for beauty,
Nor had they time to sing,
For eye and ear and heart and soul
Were busy bartering.
Yet, when the shadows lengthened,
And ere the sun went down,
I left the valley’s lure and light,
And took my way to town.
Though lovely was the valley,
And though its peace was good,
My throat cried out. for ruddy wine,
My body craved for food.
I saw in shining windows
Brown loaves and sparkling wine;
But wine and bread were not for me,
For ne’er a coin was mine.
With goodly fare to cheer them,
I saw them trooping by—
The folk that thronged the market-place
Were wiser folk than I.
Oh. he goes thirsty-throated,
And hunger grins him strong,
Who eats alone of Beauty’s bread,
And drinks the wine of song.

PATRIOTISM WITH A PRUSSIAN
ACCENT.
In Australia within the last month or so
there have been self-righteous attacks on
the Diggers (soldier-settlers in N. S. Wales
were lumped together as “rotters,- wasters
and criminals”) ; on the R.A.N., described
by a S. M. Herald contributor as “a white
elephant from the beginning, and a very
troublesome one, too”; and on the French.
The insults directed at the French were
justified by the mostly anonymous writers
who levelled them on the ground that the
French press had “shown hatred for Eng-
land,” though the reputable French journals
are as correct in their references to
the British as the London Times is in its
references to the French. Concurrent
with the sneers, covert and open, aimed at
the nation which our professional loyalists
so be-slobbered while danger threatened,
there has been much laudation of the Ger-
mans, one or two correspondents actually
breaking the prevailing seal of anonymity to
stress the splendid virility and so forth of
this master-race. These manifestations may
be quite unrelated, or, anyhow, their authors
may honestly believe they are. Nevertheless,
the cumulative effect is to provide a pro-
German drive of the sort that the Pots-
dam press promised its readers would be
successfully engineered in every foreign
country as soon as the first war-bitterness
should have died down. Two questions
which Australia needs to ask itself before
an anti-Digger, anti-R.A.N. and anti-French
convention becomes definitely established
are: (1) Has this country a moral right
to turn on any of its saviours? And (2) is
such a procedure likely to pay?
* * * *
It is no doubt in the immediate interests
of big business here, as in the United Ivingr
dom, that Germany should be got on its feet
in the industrial sense. A solvent Germany
would be ready to pay well for our wool,
wheat, meat and metals; its mercantile
marine would help to swell the wealth
of our coastal cities; its tourists
would add to the dividends of our
hotels; its waiters, musicians, barbers,
domestics, etc., would provide good and dis-
ciplined service as in the days before the
war. It is possible, however, for a class
to make the mistake of being a shade too
cynically clever. The Stuarts in England,
the Bourbons in France, the Romanoffs in
Russia, all lost their thrones, some of them
lost their lives, and thousands of their
adherents lost everything, lives included, be-
cause they made this mistake. The Diggers
—the men who were to be treated like kings
by their grateful country when they returned
from the Front—have become more or less
resigned to the spectacle of many of their
old comrades, whom the war ruined physi-
cally or mentally, being spoken of as mal-
efactors by eligible shirkers. Our sailors,
who joined the R.A.N. on the nation’s word
that the fleet was there to stay, and who
understood after the war that they had
done their country a commendable service,
have ceased to protest w r hen anti-Aus-
traiian advocates of a hireling squadron—•
their heads up again after 10 years of com-
pulsory silence —point out patronisingly that
the R.A.N. is no use, never was any use,
and had better be scrapped. And the gen-
eral public, which between 1914 and the
Armistice had it dinned into its ears by
the press that the Germans were Huns and
the French demi-gods, is silently, if not
patiently, accepting the new proposition,
which is, in effect, that the real Huns are
the French. But such unnatural complais-
ance is only a surface affair. Underneath
there is a leaven working which our revolu-.
tionists are bound to exploit, a leaven of
contempt for the methods, and suspicion of the
aims, of the frauds behind the moneybags,
who are rich and secure to-day largely be-
cause of the part Diggers, sailors and the
French played in the war. No logical argu-
ment exists against the capitalist system
per se, and every intelligent agitator knows
it. But human nature being what it is, there
is a powerful argument in an ethical appeal
based on the SruART-like unfaith, the Bour-
BON-like unimaginativeness of individual
capitalists. It is this appeal that our
capitalists provide with moral support every
time they turn down a soldier or sailor
whose troubles are the result of war injuries,
or exalt a German at the expense of a
Frenchman.
* * * *
Putting aside this issue, there is the pro-
bability, amounting almost to certainty, that
in backing a resuscitated Germany we are
putting our money on a horse whose success
stands to ruin the Empire. Not at once. off.
course. We ought all to make a great deal
of money before the first cloud shows over
the horizon. But just as surely as Britain
was doomed to fight for its life from the
moment when, balf-a-century ago, a beaten
and impoverished France —a France which
had paid the biggest indemnity in history in-
side three years—enabled Bismarck to face
the world with a militarily and economically
united Germany, so Britain, and we with
her, will be condemned to fight again if
France goes down again. The weaknesses of
the French, which the local “loyalist” has
been stressing with such gusto—their sta-
tionary population, their poor record as
colonists —will be our protection so long as
France remains mistress of Europe: Ger-
many, with its 60,000,000 inhabitants, its
booming birth-rate, its genius for commerce
and its need of colonies, must begin to
threaten us again as soon as it is in a posi-
tion to threaten anybody. In August, 1918,
when, though the Kaiser’s generals knew
they were beaten, his professors did not, the
London Times printed translations from tbe
Frankfort Zeitung, Berlin Tageblatt and
other papers which were then publishing the
views on the situation of representative Ger-
mans. They were agreed about a number of
things: that France did not matter, which-
ever way the war went —that win or lose it
could be “dealt with”; that the real enemy,
in the economic sense, was England; and
that the ultimate way to counter the im-
perialistic ambitions of both England and
the U.S.A. was by concluding an agreement
with Japan. The remarks of Professor
Otto Hoetzsch were typical:—
Against France and Russia we stand only on the
defensive. The real enemy is England, whose great-
est competitor we are, desire to remain, and must
remain. We have to set up our policy and method
against the joint policy and method of the Anglo-
Saxons. We need the extension of power, territori-
ally and otherwise, for the same reason that Eng-
land aims at extension of power. Without power
there is no security The community of our inter-
ests is with Jatian. After the war Jspan will need
Germany. That is exactly why the Entente desires
to hold Japan fast.
No one who has read history will believe
that post-war Germany is any different,
spiritually, from the Germany that went to
war for colonies (i.e., trade) eight years
ago. It is still the greatest coal-owning
country in Europe, and, therefore, potenti-
ally the greatest producer of iron and steel.
And. according to the official figures tabled
in the British Parliament six months ago,
while the French taxation is fII jss. 7d.
per head, that of Germany is 19s. 3d. per
head. In such a situation it surely behoves
us to speak sympathetically of the nation
which, after Britain, did more than any other
to save Australia during the war-years; or,
if we cannot do that, to keep silent
ACROSS THE RHINE.
[Florence Hayward, after working for Australian
soldiers during the war, settled in France, where
she had married. Her article was written early in
December.]
Ostend, so gay in its brief summer season,
met us on this early-winter morning with
closed hotels and shuttered shops, offering
so cold a welcome that we hurried on to
Brussels. Two months before I had come
into Germany through Amsterdam, and had
found the Dutch capital as expensive as I
now found the Belgian inexpensive; but,
then. Holland has grown much richer in
the last eight years, while Belgium has be-
come infinitely poorer: in Holland, indeed,
the Englishman has the rare experience of
finding his pound worth less than 20s. in
the currency of the country. This time I
had arranged to go on through Cologne, the
headquarters of the British Army of Occu-
pation, to visit an old friend, the wife of
an officer. At home I had come to regard
the British Army of Occupation as of no
value. In Cologne I came to the conclusion
that it was of less value even than that.
There are none of the marks of an army on
a grim mission about this force of 40,000
men. It is just having a picnic at the ex-
pense of the heavily-burdened taxpayer at
home. Life for the majority of the officers
and their women-folk is a procession of
gaieties. Some of the best of the men are
marrying German girls; some of the worst
of them are not. Youngsters in receipt of
£250 to £350 a year find themselves suddenly
with a salary which, owing to the deprecia-
tion of the mark, has a purchasing power
of £lOOO or more, and they live accordingly.
I don’t suppose one in ten of them is put-
ting by a farthing; most of the other nine
will take away with them nothing but expen-
sive tastes and doubtful habits. And the
chances of recovering from Germany any
of the cost grow thinner and thinner.
The civilian coming into Cologne will not
find goods startlingly cheap: authority, how-
ever, says that the Army of Occupation shall
not be treated worse than the local inhabi-
tant in the matter of prices. The British
spend: that in the local view is one thing
in their favor. There is not much placed
to their debit, indeed, except that they. are
there. With the French and Belgians it is
different. Unable to forget their ruined ter-
ritories, they “rub it in.” The “black sol-
diers” are a special grievance: Mayence is
their headquarters. The French plead that
they have these soldiers from their colonies
in France, and what is good enough for
France is a thousand times too good for
Germany. Of my own knowledge I can say
nothing on the point; but German women
have told me that brothels have been pro-
vided for these colored men, and that Ger-
man girls are the sufferers. If not the cause
this is the excuse for much bitterness.
Of all the German people the women of
the “middle class” are the sorest sufferers
from their country’s great crime—though it
may save everybody trouble later on if we
recognise that you would have to go a long
way to find a German woman who would
admit that her country committed any crime.
In Germany, as elsewhere, there are large
numbers of women whose husbands, now de-
ceased, made provision for them, by insur-
ance or otherwise. They were due for a
fixed number of marks; and at this moment
it takes many marks to do the work which
formerly one single mark did. Thousands
of women who before the war lived in com-
parative affluence are now destitute. I
know the family of a once distinguished
lawyer who became a judge. During his
lifetime, by German carefulness in such mat-
ters, he provided as he believed adequately
for his wife and young family—he married
late. The sons got official jobs of some sort;
and they are working as porters in their
spare time to keep the family cupboard sup-
plied. The girls set to work as typists; the
mother takes odd jobs of sewing. In Eng-
lish money the boys get less than 10s. a
week. Manufacturers and such like are
prosperous enough, and it is for their fami-
lies that the shops deck themselves so finely.
As the mark falls they put up their prices;
and the lower it falls the better placed they
are to do foreign trade. Many of their costs
advance, no doubt; but they don’t keep up
with the fall in the mark. Railway rates
are greatly in their favor, for one thing.
A friend of mine, curious to know what could
be done in the way of cheap travel, took the
fourth-class on a 57-mile trip. It cost him
in German money the equivalent of three
farthings in English. The foreigner doesn’t,
however, always score like that. The shops
and hotels have one price for the German
and another for the stranger. I have paid
20,000 marks for what my Army of Occu-
pation friends have got for 4000.
In Berlin the presence of the stranger is
not resented; but it is in Munich and some
other places. I once suggested to an Aus-
trian friend v that he might do something for
an English relation ,of mine who proposed
to go to Vienna. “Why,” he asked, “does
he come to eat our bread?” Bread and butter
are scarce even in Germany ; and Germany
is in a far better way than Austria. Though
the stranger pays more, the thoughtful Ger-
man knows that he is not paying, in many
cases, anything like the service costs. On
the railways, for instance. And that is what
hurts. Somebody has got to pay the differ-
ence—and the German knows it will not be
the stranger. Still, he is for the most part
indifferent How the tangle his country has
got into is to be unravelled he does not
know ; but he still has a tremendous belief
in German capacity. It may be all part of
a vast plan. He believes so, at any rate.
And he is quite sure that if it is a German
plan it is a very good plan.
There are millions, however, who don’t
know anything about the depreciation of the
mark—millions who know no more about it
than the millions of England know about the
depreciation of the pound. All they do know
is that they have to pay a little more each
month for herrings and calico. That a
pound English is worth at this moment
nearly 50.000 marks means nothing to them.
They don’t know anything about the pound
English—know no more about it than the
millions of English know about the Ger-
man mark. Tell them that the mark is
worth only a thousandth of what it was and
they simply will not believe you. The ser-
vant fraulein who used to get seven or eight
marks a week doesn’t now get seven or eight
thousand, nor a quarter of it. And yet she
lives pretty well. It is quite a mistake,
therefore, to express German prices, wages
and so on in English money and draw con-
clusions from tb* result. The fraulein may
get what in English money means only two
or three shillings a week —with board, of
course —but she can get a very good outfit
for seven and sixpence. It is only the un-
fortunate “middle class.” the people with
fixed incomes, whose revenues in marks have
not increased at all. who are being ground
between the upper and the nether millstones;
and they are the prime sufferers in all coun-
tries, though, of course, not everywhere to
the same degree.

In Retrospect.
When W. M. Hughes, making a virtue of
necessity, removed himself irorn the tart-
shop, there closed the longest and luckiest
political bluff on record. It lasted for six
years, less 15 days, and if the Liberals had
had an enterprising leader instead of jaded
old Cook and Forrest it wouldn’t have
lasted six minutes. 111-informed persons
used to be fond of drawing parallels between
Hughes’s position in 1917 and that of
Lloyd George. The only real parallel was
that both were Welsh Prime Ministers.
Lloyd George brought into the British coali-
tion the power, prestige, organisation and
funds of a party that had triumphed at
three elections and, in his own person, the
greatest war reputation in Europe. When
the Asquithians broke with him lie retained
his grip on the party machinery, and at the
1918 election 183 Lloyd George Liberals
were returned, as against 28 Wee Frees.
Although the Conservatives have regained
their ascendancy his party is still to be
reckoned with ; at the recent appeal to the
people, when every other group sought its
destruction, it won 58 seats out of 615, and
among its possessions are a well-stocked war
chest and an influential press. But the
Labor remnant which imposed itself on the
Australian Liberals had neither organisation,
funds nor press. The party fr > which it be-
longed had narrowly won the 1914 election
(it lost that of 1913), but it had been beaten
in two by-elections, one for the retiring Pri-
minister’s seat, and the sands were running
out. Came the first of the ignoble war refer-
endums, and Hughes stood before the public
head of a oissolving Government which, in a
situation much more favorable than that of
Canada, Britain or the U.S.A., had failed
to carry conscription, and leader of a divided
party from which he and the 14 Representa-
tives and 11 Senators who followed him
were about to be expelled. Amidst universal
derision a Ministry in which seven of the
14 Representatives held office carried on until
the 1917 election hove in sight and the
Liberals had to decide what they would do
with Hughes. His necessity > was their
opportunity, such an opportunity as they
never had before and will never get again.
It was within their power to break him
utterly, for without Liberal heir), as was
indicated when he scurried away from West
Svdnov, neither he nor any of his 14 Renre-
sentatives could have got back. Had Labor
remained united it couldn’t have won in
1917. Its fate on polling-day is always
determined by the kind elector who is
neither Labor nor Liberal, but votes as dic-
tated bv the circumstances and temoer of
the hour. This support it had definitely
lost by its attitude to the w'ar, an attitude
which became contemptible when the larger
moiety of the party shouted for peace—a
peace that would have left the Hohenzollern
master of tho world—on the eve of the last
victorious offensive. Rightly handled, the
support of the unorganised majority would
have kept the Liberals in power for many
years. But they sacrificed everything
for the man who had been their bitter-
est and most unscrupulous enemy. Under
the spell of a strange infatuation
they handed him the control of their
party, policy, organisation, funds and
the impregnable position they had gained in
his despite. They let him grab the Prime
Ministership and the pick of the portfolios,
with full _ command of the Senate. Thejf
allowed him to involve them in the shame
of the second war referendum ; to break his
solemn undertaking to resign if it should
be defeated, as it was ; to make himself auto-
crat of Australia, for and after “the dura-
tion.” by virtue of his infamous War Pre-
cautions Act; to set up subsidiary dictator-
ships for the control of banking, shipping,
metals, wheat and wool; to rush into ruinous
contracts without reference to Parliament;
to plunge into wild orgies of departmental-
ism and general extravagance—in short, to
commit all manner of follies alien to Liberal
policy and tradition. They even permitted
him to heap ridicule on them by proclaiming
himself “a socialist” and “as good a Labor
man as ever,” which he did dcwn to quite
recent times; and they didn’t object in the
slightest when he dragged them into a stupid
vendetta with their natural allies of the
Country party. They followed the man so
meekly, with such besotted constancy, that,
six weeks after the election in which he lost
his majority and five of his Ministers, many
of them were apparently quite willing that
he should destroy what remained of the
party rather than step down from the Prime
Ministershin in obedience to the peonle’s ver-
dict. This devotion might be admirable if the
object of it were a great man, but Hughes
is not great. When there were giants in the
Commonwealth Parliament he failed to mea-
sure up to their standard. Watt left his
Cabinet with a low opinion of his adminis-
trative abilities. Latham. M.P., and Eggles-
ton, M.L.A., who had first-hand opportuni-
ties of judging his diplomatic performances
abroad, speak of them with contempt. H.
G. Wells he impressed as “a last belated
adventurer in the advertising line.” The only
respect in which Hughes attains real great-
ness is in his capacity for bluff. Among the
class of politicians that Australia gets nowa-
days no quality is more highly regarded.
Agriculture—Political and Scientific.
Part of the Sydney Government’s new land
policy is to increase the average yields of
farm products in its debt-encumbered State,
which average yields, owing to various pre-
ventible causes, are nearly the lowest in the
world. So much was hinted at by Premier
Fuller before he left for London in quest
of the usual quarterly loan. With striking
perspicacity he pointed out that “if our dairy
cows, which now average onlv 1201 b. of
butter per cow per annum, could be brought
up to the average of Holland or North
America, say, 2401 b. of butter per cow per
annum, that alone would double the output
from our dairy farms.” Flushed with his
success in demonstrating that 240 is the
result of 120 multiplied bv 2, he added that


"this is one of the commonsense reforms
which the Government aims at accomplish-
ing,” But after the manner of politicians
he didn’t explain how. If words could do
the business Fuller would soon have the
N. S. Wales wheat yield per acre (11.34
bushels over a period of 10 years) raised
to the 41 bushels harvested in Denmark;
the maize average lifted from 26.20 bushels
to 49.2 bushels, the Canadian figures in
1920; and the return of oats, now 16.72
bushels, bumped up to 44 bushels, as in the
U.K., setting aside the 70 bushels some-
times harvested in Belgium. But something
more is required than the pious aspirations
of politicians. Neither is the favorite device
of rushing a multitude of street-bred novices
into the bush, on the principle that any fool
can run a farm, calculated to produce 40-
bushel crops or induce Strawberry to give
two gallons of milk where she gave only one
before. Not until the Fullers and Mit-
chells realise that the bad farmer is not
worth encouraging, and that the agricultural
scientist should be encouraged to the limit,
will a general increase in production be
obtained. Although the wheat crops failed
over a portion of N. S. Wales it is reported
from the Riverina that “thanks to the liberal
use of superphosphates and the adoption
of fallowing it has been one of the best sea-
sons on record. Yet the rainfall in some
’cases was little more than half of the 1921
total.” In Victoria’s northern Mallee the
season was so bad that the Government has
arranged to provide 2000 settlers, 600 of
them returned soldiers, with the wherewithal
to put in and take off this year’s crop. But
Miscamble, one of the Railway Commis-
sioners, noticed, during a visit to the stricken
region, that “those who had farmed intelli-
gently were getting the best returns. One
man who had worked his land well had
stripped 18 bushels to the acre, whereas six
bushels was the average on an adjoining
property, which had received little atten-
tion.” Investigations conducted by the Vic-
torian Department of Agriculture as to the
water requirements of crops grown under
Australian conditions show that an inch of
rain during the growing period is capable of
producing 3|- bushels of wheat. In other
words, the normal rainfall over the known
wheat belt is sufficient for 40-bushel crops;
and, according to A. E. V. Richardson,
Director of the Agricultural School at Mel-
bourne University, in a paper read at the
Australasian Science Congress, this yield has
been obtained at Longerenong (Vic.) Col-
lege, and by Nhill farmers working on
a scientific plan. The researches of the Vic.
scientists have revealed the necessity of fer-
tilisers, which lessen the water requirements
of'the plant; of fallowing, which conserves
moisture equal to the quantity ordinarily lost
by evaporation; of incessant experiments in
breeding drought-resistant wheats like Fed-
eration, which has a high percentage of
grain to straw; and of testing the rate of
evaporation from arid lands, such as the
drought-ridden district north of Mildura
(Vic.), in which Carruthers wanted to
dump a large proportion of his Million
Farmers, so as to determine whether the
cultivation thereof would be profitable or
ruinous. But all this is Greek to the booming
type of Government in whose bright lexicon
land-settlement is only a synonym for votes.
The Foreigner’s Stranglehold.
On a neglected Australian industry :
Since “The Sentimental Bloke” film was shown in
London, and W. G. Faulkner wrote in the Daily
Mail “Year Book” that Doreen, Mar and the Bloke
were “the most lovable characters ever seen on the
screen,” there has been an unsatisfied demand in
Britain for Australian-made pictures. The fact was
stressed the other day by the Sunday Illustrated
in an article headed “Australian Films Wanted.”
Weary of Yankee subjects, with their eternal glorifi-
cation of cowboys, crooks and cocottes, the English
are hungering for themes of romance and adventure
from this imperfectly-known continent. According
to the Sunday Illustrated man they showed more
interest in the Bush section of the Ross Smith film
than “even in the wonders of India.” Travel films
and “good dramas of life in the Backblocks” would,
he insists, be “sure of a welcome from the British
public.” But the goods are not forthcoming, and
Stuart McGregor, British Trade Commissioner in
Australia, supplies a reason in his annual report:—
American film interests have a stranglehold on
Australian cinema theatres. British and Australian
films can be shown only if it suits American inter-
ests, though the public would welcome them. The
duration of' the American monopoly depends on the
public’s patience and the enterprise of British film
interests in removing or destroying it. Australian
filming is almost at a standstill, though Australian
episodes and scenery are most suitable for artistic
and interesting treatment.
McGregor’s statement of the position, humiliating
as it is to the Commonwealth, contains nothing new.
Similar remarks were made during the 1921 session
of the national Parliament, when the Greene tariff
was going through. Rivers of eloquence flowed on
that occasion about the injurious effects of American
control of film supplies and theatres and the unpro-
tected condition of the local producer. Bursts
of indignation followed the Ministerial confession
that the exposed film imported from the U.S.A.,
amounting to fifteen-seventeenths of the total
footage screened, was declared at so low a value
that the Customs Department got only a few score
thousands a year out of it, although the picture-
show revenue for the same period might amount to
four or five millions. And when the gentleman
protested that ad valorem duties were out of the
question, since it was impossible to arrive at the
value of a length of film, there were howls of
dissent. Dealing with the trading methods of
Yankee picture-houses, Massy Greene said: —
Sometimes the film is invoiced at practically the
cost of production, exclusive of the salaries of artists,
cost of staging, etc., and certain royalties are
charged, usually three or four cents a foot. Some-
times the film is invoiced at cost, and a percentage
of the gross takings (usually 65 per cent.) is
remitted to America. In other cases, the film is
invoiced at cost, and all profits are remitted to
America.
The meaning of “cost of production,” as applied to
American pitchers, is elucidated in the 1921 list
of imports, the latest available. In that yeai
17,278,806 ft. of foreign film came over the ocean,
15,256.874 ft. of it from the U.S.A. The American
stuff was valued at £205,851, or a trifle more than 3d.
a foot. Duty, at the rate of 14d. a foot, was paid
on about 13,600,000 feet, or £85,000 altogether.
At this rate, an Australian company engaging in
the production of, say, 3000 ft. films would have to
compete with a multitude of American sets valued
by their owners at £4O a piece or less, and duti-
able at another £2O. And then there would be
the difficulty of finding a showman able or will-
ing to buy the home-made article, for “the com-
bine won’t supply U.S. pictures,” said Riley,
M.H.R., “to those who screen Australian films.”
Moved by the impossibility of developing a
native industry in such circumstances, and by the
necessity of discouraging the importation of pic-
tures that seem to be made by ruffians for the
entertainment of savages, the House of Reps, adopted
a resolution that the duty should be 3d. a foot,
instead of lid. But at this the foreign-film interest
squealed so piercingly that the Senate was moved
to request that the impost should be left at the old
farcical figure, and (the Christmas adjournment hav-
ing drawn near) the House yielded. It likewise
abandoned a design for appointing a select com-
mittee to consider the movie business in all its
relations. In the next (and 1 last) session, which was
appropriated by the Government to its various vote-
buying schemes, the subject was dropped. But the
new Parliament can’t afford to let it remain dropped.
One of its manifest duties is to stop the flow of
nasty foreign films, with their poisonous incitements
to crime, sensuality, bad English, worse manners
and hatred of Britain, and to encourage the pro-
duction of bright and healthy Australian pictures in
their stead. According to Faulkner, in his 1922
review, “the film drama, however elaborately it
may be produced, has had its day. A demand has
arisen for a varied programme of shorter pictures
... .of travel and adventure films, wild-animal and
bird studies,” and the like. The producers of
“The Sentimental Bloke” and “The Wild Nor’-West”
have shown that these shorter pictures can be pro-
duced in Australia. Given the necessary measure
of protection there would be a fine local market,
and no mean export trade. And, in addition to
finding employment for writers, actors, photo-
graphers, carbon-makers and so forth, the industry,
thus established, would feed other industries, for the
profits wouldn’t go to the Zimmermans, Saurweins,
Blumenfelds and Fritzensteins whose names now
splurge across the silver sheet. To have a dozen
or a score of companies turning out a good class
of pictures (this would have to be insisted upon
as a condition of protection) would be advan-
tageous to Australia in lots of ways. And the thing
could be done by a scientific amendment of the
tariff, or, after due notice, by limiting the imports
of films in any year to the quantity produced in
Australia.
Cactus and the Automatic Debt-payer.
Queensland has now 27,000,000 acres
closely settled with prickly-pear, and N. S.
Wales has 6,000,000 acres. The Ma State’s
area is increasing at the rate of 1,000,000
acres per annum, which beats all other
forms of settlement out of sight. Minister
Wearne proposes a bill (1) to prohibit the
further spread of the spiky thing; (2) pro-
viding that money may be advanced to pear-
infested landholders; and (3) providing that
birthday presents may be made of infested land
on which the clearing won’t cost more than
the value of the cleared property. But it
is drearily added :
There will remain vast areas which will not pay
the cost of clearing, and will be locked up, gloomy and
impenetrable, for all time.
If so, it is a bad look-out for this fair coun-
try, for these vast, gloomy, grumpy areas
will be a standing source of infection, and
the disease will make a fresh spring forward
whenever the community isn’t looking, and
advance on a wider front and increase its
rate of progress. Much of the gloomy and
impenetrable and unpayable land might per-
haps be lifted into the payable category if
more people were on or near it, and the
people might come if the regions were for
practical purposes one or two or three hun-
dred miles nearer a deep-sea port. That
miracle could be performed for half the
arable part of N. S. Wales with a few short
railways, which would cost not much more
than is frittered away annually in pushing
the Sydney lines further towards the dry
and setting sun. In many sections of the
State there are fewer people to fight the
cactus, or even to take note of its progress,
than there were 30 years ago, which isn’t
hopeful. The vegetable is a known and
proved source of industrial alcohol, which
is badly wanted, and it i 3 really a question
of getting the curse to the distillery at a
cheap rate. South Africa is making a seri-
ous effort along these lines to make the
pear pay handsomely for its own restriction.
It looks to the cheap Kaffir as its pear-
picker. Australia, happily, has no Kaffir,
but it has a machine-making capacity which
should come in somewhere. The cactus
being one of Australia’s very few proved
oil-wells, it might have been more to the
point to offer £50,000 for its development
than to offer a similar amount, as has been
done, to encourage prodding for the very
uncertain petroleum. Even a prize of
£IOO,OOO might be justifiable for the ideal
machine. The offer would stimulate a much
higher form of ingenuity than that involved
in the search for chance deposits of oil.
Quite a lot of useful inventions might be
accidentally evolved in the course of the
struggle for the prize—perhaps even the
much-needed preaching machine that is war-
ranted to fill churches twice on Sunday, or
the long-sought rain-making apparatus, or
the subterranean aeroplane for flying under-
ground or the automatic debt-payer. It is
always a safe line to stimulate invention.
The number of things waiting to be in-
vented, even at this late date, are more num-
erous than all the oil-wells that ever were
or will be.
In the Land of Ordinances.
After 10 healthy years in the Northern
Territory, partly as a barrister and latterly
on such bench as there is up there —as
much of it as the white ants haven’t eaten —
Justice Roberts lately came south for a
vacation, and perhaps to get things off his
mind. He is an admirer of the North, like
most men who have lived there long, and a
modified admirer of the way the North has
been managed under Federal officialdom. In
old days the great Possession was run under
S. Australian law —the ordinary, intelligible
statute law which is discussed in Parlia-
ment and so can’t wholly dodge publicity.
Two Territory members helped to make the
article. The S.A. code still applies, except
where it has been impinged upon by “ordi-
nances,” made by the Governor-
General. though really dashed off by his uni-
versal Pooh-Bah in that gentleman’s spare
moments. Where the ordinances don’t suffice
the bureaucrats think out some law or a
scrap of equity to meet the case. The sys-
tem is really administration by a series of
spasms and short impatient barks wired
'from Melbourne. The chief official of the
Territory is the Administrator, but no less
than seven departments get their instruc-
tions direct from the Seat of Government,
and if Hughes or whoever it is is busy or
absent they wait for instructions. If the
seven parallel streams get mixed at times
it is only natural. The latest Federal
"Official Year Book” (No. 15) is reticent on
the subject, but No. 14 gives a ten-years’
record, during which time 95 laws were
posted or passionately wired over from Mel-
bourne for the Possession's improvement
and guidance. There were six liquor laws
in the 10 years. In 1918 the drink statute
was breathlessly patched three times, for
the same reason which causes the incapable
tailor to get the botched suit back thrice
or oftener for alteration. There is a lack
of ordinary stability about a country where
the ineffective ghost in nominal charge is
always wiring to his absentee director: “Law
received yesterday no good. Tried it on dog
and nearly killed animal. Send along new
law at once”; to which the hurried god
replies: “Can’t remember what it’s all about,
but sample law herewith. Very busy.” The
Territory, which had a plain, usual sort of jury
law when taken over by the Commonwealth,
got three new jury laws almost all at once,
and nine Crown Lands statutes or statutettes
arrived in eight years. In the days of plain
and simple S.A. management two trains
per week traversed the little railway each
way, which was a better service than exists
on some N.S.W. State lines to-day. For
the final half-year of State control the work-
ing expenses were £6396, or at the rate of
£12,792 per annum. Governed by ordinance
from the far-end of things the 12 months’
expenses, five years later, and still for the
same length of rail, were £47,953. And, by
way of lending point to the jest, the two
trains per week have degenerated to one
train per fortnight. Still, there is this
redeeming feature: when it was pointed out
that, for settlers who wanted to get perish-
able produce moved, a train every fortnight
was much the same as none at all, a special
was put on to run every six weeks! A
great deal has been said about the erratic
Prime Minister’s acceptance of a gift of
£25,000 from parties unknown. It wasn’t
that too much was said, but too much was
said in proportion to what was left unsaid
about other matters. It a leader can be
found to retrieve the millions of lost money
and the years of lost progress in the Terri-
tory alone he should be allowed to ac-
cept £25,000 without comment. In fact, he
would be dirt cheap though he stole £50,000
outright.
«y
A K.B.E. Owns Up.
During the late elections the Prime Min-
ister declined to answer any questions about
his £25,000; his supporters averred that he
did not know the subscribers’ names; and
so sensitive did he become that whoever
mentioned his wealth at one of his meetings
was flung out. And now, after all this mys-
tery, David Storey, one of Sydney’s New
Year knights, blandly tells Melbourne that
“he was one of the subscribers to the £25 000
testimonial given to Mr. Hughes, and that
he could see no harm in the Prime Min-
ister’s acceptance of a gift which cost the
taxpayers nothing.” But did it cost the
taxpayers nothing? One of the things the tax-
payers might now be excused for wondering
is whether it cost them David Storey’s
knighthood. That the amiable old Randwiek
hatter should have been singled out for this
gaud which has already got the Sydney
pony-racing and vaudeville industries repre-
sentation in “Debrett,” is neither here nor
there. It is the principle that counts, and
that is where the taxpayer comes in. Admit
the proposition that one man may obtain
favorable consideration, when K.8.E.-reeom-
mendations are going, by subscribing to some
Prime Minister’s testimonial (and there are
thousands of Australian soldiers, scientists,
doctors, lawyers, engineers, etc., who had
better claims than Storey if there was not
a condition precedent), and it follows that
another subscriber may claim favorable con-
sideration in some other direction. In the
matter of a concession, for example, or a
job. Concessions and jobs, where they go
to the wrong men—the sort of men who are
driven to rely for preferential treatment
not on their merits, but on their money ; not
on the services they have done the State, but
on the size of the cheque they are prepared
to hand over—are liable to be ruinously
costly to the taxpayers. And the same
applies to companies, British or Australian,
which do not usually subscribe to politi-
cians’ testimonials for nothing. It was the
recognition of this fact that produced such
a lively interest in the source of Mr.
Hughes’s fortune; and the only effect of
his passionate refusals to satisfy the pub-
lic’s legitimate curiosity has been to inten-
sify the suspicion that some of the contri-
butors did not contribute in vain.
The Advantage of Law-breaking on a
Big Scale.
On last Victorian Derby Day, when every
prominent N. S. Wales bookmaker was in
Melbourne in pursuit of his calling, the Syd-
ney police raided 17 Pitt, King and Castle-
reagh streets betting-shops. All belonged to
leading bookmakers, yet the confiscated tak-
ings amounted to only a shade over £23 per
betting-shop. In previous raids in this
locality the paltry size of the booty has given
rise to suggestions that the victims were
warned beforehand. There was no justifica-
tion for such a charge in this casein view
of the day and time selected there simply
couldn’t be much money to be im-
pounded. The farce was conducted on a spec-
tacular scale by 60 armed policemen in
motor-cars, and on lines which had been re-
hearsed a month beforehand. It was the
sensation of the hour; and when the news
was given out that the police had occupied
the bookmakers’ offices, and declared them
illegal within the meaning of the Act, and
taken over the telephones, a suspicion be-
came current that the guardians of law and
order, who have ever been implacable in
respect of the remote suburban two-upper
and the back-lane taker of half-crown
wagers, really meant business this time as
regards the leviathans of speculation. The
anti-climax wasi provided by a modest
announcement last week :
Some months ago the police made a raid upon
the offices and residences of a number of prominent
bookmakers, arrested the bookmakers and charged
them with being keepers of common gaming houses.
Since the raids the premises have been kept under
quarantine, but it is now understood that this is
to be lifted and the charges against the owners
withdrawn.
On the very day the police told the press
that they did not propose to proceed against
the big bookmakers —all of whom are known
as law-breakers, while several have been
raided before —an obscure person named
Adams was presented at the Central Police
Court. The police evidence showed that
Adams had been betting in a lane off George-
street, and that he had amassed £6 145., of
which ss. was marked money. He was fined
£2O, in default two months’ gaol. A ques-
tion that the public has a right to have
answered is: Why should Adams, who bets
in shillings, have a conviction and heavy
penalty registered against him, while men
of substance, whose names are household
words on every Australian racecourse, and
who are known to bet illegally in hundreds,
get off Scot-free? The matter strikes at
the root of our system of justice. If the
wealthy offenders have been relieved of a
prosecution because they are wealthy, be-
cause they have offended on the £IOOO-a-year-
oflice scale instead of on the hurried and
casual back-lane scale, the rule of law is at
an end.
Jajmn and the Alien.
Dear Bulletin, —The vociferous Japanese
complaint that the yellow peoples are con-
fined to a narrow area, owing to the selfish
policy of domineering whites who want to
own the earth, has little foundation in fact.
It isn’t easy for anyone who has travelled
in Japan to accept this self-portrait of a
meek yellow man, whose gentle Buddhism
has no chance in the struggle for power
against the white man’s ruthless Christianity.
In pre-war times the Jap was never the
strap-hanger in life’s tram-car; in fact, he
generally got a very good seat. And to-
day, judging from the latest evidence, it
seems that he has not forgotten how to look
after his own interests. In a recent series
of articles the U.S. publicist Isaac Mak-
cossan gave a careful, detailed account of
conditions in present-day Japan. People
have heard a good deal about the restrictions
placed on the Japanese alien by selfish Aus-
tralians and Californians, and Japan is re-
presented as being in a state of uncontrollable
irritation at the spectacle of its nationals
being treated as aliens. Yet the infuriated
country has always been eminent for its own
anti-alien spirit. In Japan the alien is not
allowed to own land outright. He is barred
from acquiring shares in any subsidised com-
pany, and most companies are subsidised one
way or the other, or in the leading banks.
He is forbidden, as an individual, to engage
in mining. The Japanese maintain, logically
enough, that as their coal and iron resources
are limited, they can’t allow such vital assets
in peace and war to pass into alien hands.
Aliens cannot become members, stockholders
or brokers in the various stock exchanges.
No foreign ships are permitted to carry pas-
sengers or freights between ports in Japan.
There are all kinds of other restrictions, not
to mention the absurd system of espionage
that seems to be worse than ever. Mae-
cossan says that practically all foreigners
are under observation from the moment they
touch the three-mile limit until they are
outside the confines of the country. The
Jap never loved the foreigner; and though
we can’t blame him for that, it is ridicu-
lous for him to complain that the
foreigner doesn’t love him, or that he doesn’t
get as fair a deal as he gives. The
race psychology is so different that any
close inter-mixture would inevitably lead
to disaster. Despite the modern improve-
ments superficially adopted, the feudal idea
persists both in national custom and govern-
ment procedure. There is no real under-
standing between Asia and Europe, and after
all Asia is a fair-sized piece of ground. “The
Japanese do not understand us,” writes the
latest observer, “and by the same token we
do not comprehend them.” Even Lafcadio
Hearn admitted at the last that he didn’t
understand the Japanese. Marcossan inter-
viewed everybody, but didn’t “get them.” I
can sympathise with him. I once interviewed
Admiral Togo ; ,it should have been a scoop,
but I didn’t “get him.” He was a little,
inconspicuous man, plainly dressed, with
nothing of what Americans call “personal-
ity.” He might have been some bank clerk
on a pound a week for all I could guess, yet
he had sunk the Russian fleet, and was un-
doubtedly a great man. The Jap is an alien
to the Californian or Australian, who in
turn is treated as an alien by the Jap. And,
despite loud protests, the Jap has none the
worse of the deal.—Yours, etc., Lours
Esson.
The Great Sticker.
Dear Bulletin, —It would be a labor of
love to write the political obituary of
Hughes, who has just retired from office,
with the brisk celerity of a limpet, after
seven and a quarter years of actual, and
some more of virtual, Prime Ministership.
As a N.S.W. institution, a N.S.W. parochial-
ist, a Canberra-ite of a sort, and a lifelong
Foreign-trader the Sydney daily papers natu-
rally gave him a cordial send-off; but when
they quitted generalities about his “great-
ness,” and tried to get down to the things he
had done, it seemed that, like the ghost of
Tomlinson, lie had done very little. The
most definite assurance was that he had
achieved marvels in securing “recognition”
for the Commonwealth in Europe, and
“recognition” is a hazy animal, not definable
and not saleable. Because Hughes quitted
Australia when there was hard, tiresome
vmrk to be done at organising armies and
finances, and repressing the vast pro-Hun
conspiracy that had spread over the land,
and took the limelit path in England, his
admirers classify him with Lloyd George,
who stuck tenaciously to his post. The re-
semblance isn’t striking. His greatest single
monument is the Northern Territory, which
was ruled by the ordinances of a suc-
cession of Hughes Governments almost ever
since it became Federal property. It is a
genuine monument, and all his own. When

so big a wreck. Hughes bequeathes an in-
flated note issue, a bank that admittedly
calls for reformation, 1704 miles of railway
which is all non-paying (his Government
built 55 miles of narrow-gauge line as an
earnest of its fixed resolve to have a uniform
standard gauge), a scheme for reducing tax-
ation by making a'defieit, a gap in the trans-
continental line, w T hich (barring the afore-
said 55 miles of narrow-gauge) gets no less,
the shell of a partially depopulated Federal
capital moping in a corner, a vast shipping
line which doesn’t publish balance-sheets,
and a repatriation business which is a
wonder for expense, confusion and inefficiency.
I don’t know whether Hughes left behind him
the Federal police force, established in a
moment of rage (I presume without Par-
liamentary authority) after somebody
bounced an egg on his hat at Warwick (Q.),
or whether he took it with him. But I know
that when he took office Australia badly
wanted a few simple statutes with no gar-
ish limelight about them, such as a uniform
divorce law and a Federal bankruptcy sys-
tem, and he didn’t leave them, behind him.
They are still wanting. In giving Hughes
a send-off his most strenuous admirers dwelt
on the rousing welcome Avhich the Diggers had
for him when he returned from negotiating
the Great Peace, sitting hard on Germany,
putting Woodrow Wilson in his place, and
securing Australia’s place among the nations.
The thing they don’t mention is the gratuity
per head, paid wholly out of loans, which
staggered even the hard-borrowing and ultra-
“loyal” Maorilanders, and left other nations
gasping—a gratuity which left behind it so
vast a debt and so vast an interest bill, and
was paid alike to the fit and the unfit, that
to-day, in a struggle to economise, the wrecks
of the Avar are largely throAvn into the gutter
to scramble for broken victuals. That may
be justice and statesmanship, but I don’t
think it is either.—Yours, etc., Griffith
Moses.

Victimised Husbands.
“Cartot’s” complaint:—
A law to which N. S. Wales’s Fuller Government
might with advantage direct, its attention is that
relating to deserted .wives and children and their
maintenance. It is a heritage from the Wade era,
and although it was brought into existence with
the best possible intentions, it has turned out a
calamitous failure —in fact, it is doubtful if
there is any other piece of legislation which pro-
vides half as many opportunities for scheming and
injustice. The excuse given for the institution of
secret courts was the undesirability of bringing pi bl c
shame upon girls and deserted wives. An excellent
idea, in theory, no doubt; but in practice it has
often produced disastrous results. For instance, the
girl who is doubtful or unwilling to admit the pater-
nity of her unborn child may select some perfectly
innocent youth of her acquaintance, and saddle him
with the blame. Were the case heard in open court, she
would hesitate to commit perjury—if only from
fear of the legal consequences. As it is, many of
these young women lie freely in the box, knowing
that the chances are a thousand to one against their
being exposed. The husband of a revengeful Avife is
liable to be placed in a most unhappy position
under this Act. Many an ignorant man imagines that
if his wife leaves him, and lives an immoral life,
his obligation to support her is cancelled in some
way. Morally, it no doubt is, but in law it remains.
In such circumstances a knowledgeable woman who
has obtained a maintenance order under the Act
does not rush to the police as soon as her husband
defaults with his weekly payments. Instead,
she waits until the arrears have mounted up to a
sum in the neighborhood of £5O or £6O. Then
she gets a warrant for his arrest, and the
unhappy man is thrown into prison without being
given the opportunity of saying a single word in
his defence, for the Act provides that so long as
a penny piece is owing on an order he Shall not be
heard. While he is occupying a cell in Long Bay
he is given work at which he may earn a few
shillings a week; but, meanwhile, his liabilities
under the order are increasing. In perhaps 12
months he is released, only to be again arrested on
the steps of the gaol. And Avlien his second term
has expired he is liable to another. In this way
the wife who is actuated by spite or a desire to have
her husband kept out of the way has little trouble
in gratifying her desires. Take a case in point.
A man was recently committed to gaol in Sydney
for disobeying an order requiring him to pay his
wife a maintenance amount of' 30s. a week, the
arrears on the order being about £4O. The wife
had been living with another man. The husband had
obeyed the order until he discovered the fact. He
now has, at the least, nine months’ imprisonment
to look forward to, and i n gaol he will meet other
men who have served three and four terms
for a similar reason, and who can confidently expect
to serve a couple more yet. The whole thing is
opposed to every principle of decency and equity.

“Macquarie Street” on round pegs in
square holes
As an example of sixes and sevens in the usually
well-ordered profession of medicine, certain aspects
of the N. S. Wales Royal Commission on Lunacy
Reform would be hard to beat. The president is the
versatile Dr. Richard Arthur, whose name is as
familiar to readers of the daily press as that of his
brilliant confrere in Melbourne, James Barrett.
First of all, Dr. G. E. Thompson, a general prac-
titioner residing at Coogee, set the ball rolling by
his noisy championship of Ciiidley and Mrs. Farr.
He went bald-headed for the Government and the
medical profession, and demanded instant reform
in lunacy matters. Dr. Thompson holds a high sur-
gical qualification, the F.R.C.S. (Eng.), and his
plate informs us that he specialises in surgery and
gynecology, subjects as wide apart from mental
diseases as the poles. Imagine the horror of Harley-
street if the possessors of the much-coveted fellow-
ship hankered after lunacy cases, or were known to
have expressed any opinion whatever on a case of
insanity ! The thing is unthinkable in those circles.
However, after a time, Parliament woke up, and
started to settle the rumpus, and placate public
opinion, by the appointment of a Royal Commission.
Jobs were provided for a few favored persons. The
president, according to his plate in Macquarie-street,
is a specialist in eye, ear, nose and throat diseases,
which specialties are as widely separated from
mental diseases as those which the Coogee prac-
titioner claims to have specially studied. The other
medical member of the Commission is Dr. Robert
Stopford, who, while he was engaged in wooing the
electors of Balmain, hung out his shingle as a
specialist in diseases of children: that specialty also
has no more in common with psychiatry than the
president’s. Thus, of the three medical gentlemen who
have become engaged in thrashing out the extremely
difficult problem of the comfort and treatment of
asylum patients and lunacy reform in general, not
one has had a thorough training in psychological
medicine —the one requisite for an inquiry of this
kind.
Despite that Dr. Eric Sinclair, the Inspec-
tor-General of Insane in N. S. Wales, is
quite unable to see the necessity for
THE CHIEF MOURNERS.
autopsies on the bodies of those w r ho have
died in lunatic asylums, it is the practice
almost everywhere. In the U.K. it is estab-
lished law that an inquest must take place
whenever a person dies in either a prison or a
mental hosptal. The same law holds good in
most parts of the Commonwealth. There
was a time in Britain when the public dis-
trusted mere statements by Government
officers about what occurred behind barred
doors. Attendants in asylums in those days
were not always noted for the gentleness
with which they handled patients. Possibly
fewer safeguards are needed nowadays against
a patient being knocked about by an attend-
ant. but it would be idle to assert that such
a thing never happens. Dr. Sinclair con-
tends that the institution of the inquiry in
N. S. Wales asylums would cause the public
to view the latter with disfavor. Actually,
autopsies should have the effect of allaying,
not fostering, suspicion.
Q .
“Chancery Lane” on post-nuptial legiti-
misation :
South Aus. is not the only State where pre-
nuptial births are automatically legitimatised by
the marriage of the parents (B. 4/l/’23). In the
Speck, under the Legitimisation Act 1905, the same
sensible provision came into force. All the Aus-
tralian States and Maoriland have within the last
20 years introduced acts for the legitimisation of
unfortunate youngsters, provided there was no legal
impediment to the marriage of the parents existing
at the time of the child’s birth. In South Aus.
the parents of illegitimate children can legitimatise
them even before the marriage, but the legal union
must be effected within 30 days of such legitimatisa-
tion. The S. Australian and Tasmanian Acts are
undoubtedly the fairest of all to the offspring, for
under the Acts operating in the other States the
father, if he so wishes, can legitimatise one of two
or more illegitimate children, and so unduly favor
such in the matter of inheritance. In all ihe
States the father is the party to effect the registra-
tion, although in Victoria a very sensible amend-
ment was passed during the war that the mother, if
the father is dead, can legitimatise the child or
children.
■ • :
Tasmanian importers have long been at a
disadvantage owing to the shipping cos.
charging £1 per ton on goods from the Cold
Country over the price demanded for delivery
at mainland ports. The Speck with its newly-
developed hydro-electric scheme has been try-
ing to attract British capital to start local
factories, but the cheapness of the power it
had to offer was to a large extent discounted
by this extra money that had to be paid for
freight on raw materials and machinery.
Hence the cabled announcement that the
surcharge is to cease and the freight to
Tasmanian ports is to be the same as to the
mainland has made the little island as
excited as if it saw five shiploads of unexpected
tourists in the offing. The news followed
closely on a reduction of ss. per ton on
British freight, and was accompanied by the
announcement of a further pretty general
reduction of 10s. per ton. Moreover, all the
cos. concerned have agreed to carry Tas-
manian apples to London for 4s. per case in-
stead of the previous ss. As a million and a
half cases are expected to be shipped next
season this will mean a saving of £75,000 to
the growers. And as there is also to be a
lowering of the freight on wool of id. per
lb., and on meat of id. per pound, export-
ers are wearing a more expansive smile
than they have been afflicted with for years.
“Griffith Moses” : It is alleged in various
unfriendly quarters that the New State
movement in the northern part of N. S.
Wales is flickering low, despite the vigor of
a recent convention which named the place
“Byron,” and marked out its boundaries
and drafted the bones of its constitution.
Very likely it is. Two N. S. Wales and
two Queensland separation movements have
been more or less on the flicker for 60
years. In that time the British Govern-
ment has definitely given up the right to
grant separation, so the route by which Vic-
toria, Tasmania, Queensland and Maoriland
got their independence is closed. It was
the only route that was ever open. If it
had closed earlier there would be only one
city, a Sydney of 2,500,000 people or so,
and every hamlet, from the Gulf of Carpen-
taria to the Cold Lakes of Maoriland, would
be governed from it. The prospect of seces-
sion by. free consent of the Legislature in
the capital is about half what it was (which
it never was) through the abnormal growth
of the capitals, and in time, through the
same cause, it will be half what it is (and
it isn’t even that, nor is it likely to be).
Unless the talkers of the movement have
some, scheme for compelling a hearing, even
if it is only a strike such as cooks and stew-
ards are capable of, they should leave off.
They might capture every vote in the seces-
sion district and be no further advanced,
for there aren’t enough votes, and, propor-
tionately, there are going to be less. No-
body cares 2d. for a dumb voice crying small
print in the wilderness, and that is what
“Byron” is doing.
Tiie fact that some stewards on the Com-
monwealth steamer Esperance Bay broke
the monotony of life by seizing and ducking
sundry lady passengers has drawn attention
to the bonhomie and camaraderie that pre-
vail on the Federal Government line. The
employees supply the camaraderie, and the
passengers stand it with what bonhomie they
are capable of. Judging from a mass of
newspaper correspondence, all people are
equal on the floating republic which never
issues a balance-sheet—all except the passen-
gers, who aren’t. A third-class lady per
the Esperance Bay described the stern re-
proof administered by a steward to a fellow-
passenger who was late for breakfast, and
his further warning, when she rashly gave
him a back answer, that she would see what
would happen to her if the crew went on
strike —did a mutiny, in fact. Remarks
about kerosene in the food were in the
nature of a side-issue. A parson who voy-
aged to London on the Hobson’s Bay made
no very specific charges, but he commented
on the fact that the employees had the best
accommodation, on the general air of “job
control,” and on the unimportance of the
people who paid for their passages. Other
letters seemed to bear out the idea that the
workers laid undue weight on their position
as part-owners, with a prospect of becoming
whole owners when a Labor Government
comes in—that their ideas of maintaining
discipline among the passengers were those
of Tom Walsh in a milder form. The Fed-
eral fleet, and the Federal capital, and the
Federal bank, and the Federal Northern
Teritory, and the Federal repatriation depart-
ment have all lived their brief careers, wholly
or in great part, under William Hughes’s
management, and William’s management is
never entirely satisfactory.

“7PN”: Too treacherous and unstable to
be either a formidable enemy or a good ally
in the Big War, Greece didn’t even make a
success of being a decent neutral. The Turk,
a least, was gentleman enough to take a
thrashing. As a citizen outside his own
country—and this is a standard all the world
can judge by—the better class “Jacko” is
infinitely superior to the Greek. Both are
scattered far and wide in Asia, but of the
two only the Turk is respected. One of
the reasons his people are somewhat back-
ward in the scale of nations, judged by
modern standards, is that no first-class Power
has ever taken them in hand. Their handi-
cap, suffered under for innumerable cen-
turies, is that they have lived in close prox-
imity to races which belonged to a lower
order than themselves. In other words the
Turk has never rubbed shoulders with a first-
class people. Now that he has the French
in Syria matters at that end ought to im-
prove. Gladstone it was who in later days
christened him “The Unspeakable.” But
that far-seeing Jew, Disraeli, always said
that the Turk would one day come into, Jiis
own; and how Britain allowed him to
drift into the camps of our enemies—first of
the Huns and later of the Russians —-is one
of the mysteries that will always surround
our foreign diplomacy.
“Cartot” on lost fruits of German toil: —
There is truth in the statement of “Nelki” (B.
25/l/’23) that only the fringe of New Guinea has
been explored, and that the Government depart-
ments are still ignorant about even the physical
features of immense regions. In the mandated
territories much of the hinterland was examined by
the Germans while they were in occupation, and
some exceedingly fine maps, geological and other-
wise, were made. In the country from the Warriar
River, on the Papuan border, right north to the
Dutch territory, there were not many square miles
that the Germans hadn’t some knowledge about.
During the war, however, nearly all such maps were
either lost or destroyed—or just disappeared. Dur-
ing the Australian military occupation the value of
these maps and charts seemed to be little recog-
nised ; I have seen one of them used for packing
island curios that an officer was sending to Sydney
by one of the officers of the garrison. When I
rescued it and explained its importance he merely
muttered something about “German rot.” The
fact that all these maps were printed in German,
and that only about two officers in the whole force
had any understanding of that language, possibly
explains why it was that the fruits of so much hard
work were thrown away in this manner. It is
doubtful if there are any maps at all of the interior
in existence in the Commonwealth at the present
time, although Germany is sure to still have them.
«
“Distant fields are always green,” and in
Papua the “distant fields” are the coastal
lands of Dutch New Guinea, which rumor
alleges are about to be thrown open. A
lot of interest is being taken by Austral-
Papuans in this rumor, and many letters
have passed to and fro between the two sec-
tions of New Guinea. If the Dutch are offering
good terms and assistance to white settlers,
Australia will find many of her best plant-
ers drifting across the border to try their
luck in a country that is not hindered by
thick-headed Spring-street officials. It will
be a tragedy if Papua loses any of her
settlers to the adjacent colony, for experi-
enced settlers are an asset that is hard to
replace. Perhaps, if 20 or 30 good planters
do drift off to try their luck, the Australian
Government may realise that its neglect of
its own territory is bearing Dead Sea fruit.
Papua has asked till it is tired of asking,
What about the franchise and the lifting of
the Navigation Act? And a preferential
tariff for the products of Papua?

POLITICAL
POINTS
London Express says that “with the fall
of Hughes the high stage of politics loses
the last great Prime Minister of the war.”
The truth is that the Minister who can win
a war can win very little else; and it is
equally true that one who can do great
things at other times isn’t likely to win a
war. There is no mystery about it: in the
midst of a great war everything is different.
So far as the Minister is concerned reason
has to give place to emotion, cold truth isn’t
wanted and money doesn’t matter; and
thus the very qualities that peace calls for
may be actual defects in a Minister who is
waging a. war. So Asquith had to make
way for Lloyd George. In France they tried
man after man: then Clemenceau arrived,
to whip the nation to do wonderful things.
It w r as just the same in Italy. In Australia
Cook and Fisher were tried. They were not
the men for the job. With all his defects
Hughes was the best available at the
moment. In fact, just as with Lloyd
George and Clemenceau, some defects be-
came merits. France, being far more
logical than we, recognised all that and
said good-bye to Clemenceau almost as
soon as the war was over. It knew that
quite a different type of man was wanted for
the cleaning up. Britain took longer to
find it out, but did it in the end. Australia,
as the Express says, lagged behind and came
in last of all.
Most peace-time administration is stodgy
toil, and Hughes’s hatred of stodgy toil
amounts to a disease. When he took office
the plain duty lay ahead to build the South-
to-North railway according to definite con-
tract. He supplied the Territory with about
nine elaborate depax-tments for less than
5000 white people, and a small steamer,
and then left it in its old isolation. Can-
berra has been another long, melancholy
dabble, the Government having the grit
neither to go on nor to admit the failure and
leave off. The country has looked forward
to getting uniform laws re banking, insur-
ance, marriage, divorce, bankruptcy, etc. In
all the years there has been no progress with
any of them. No attempt either was made
to utilise such powers as the Commonwealth
possesses in the way of taking over and con-
solidating the State debts. The unification
of railway gauges was the subject of much
discourse, but nothing w r as even begun. In
short, Hughes could talk about everything;
but so far as action was concerned the best
he could do was to pass the matter on to
some bureau or commission, mostly with no
real power to do anything.
Until recentlv the relations between Mit-
chell, Premier of Westralia, and Collier, the
Labor leader, were exceptionally cordial—so
much so that Phil was suspected, quite un-
justly, of a desire to take office under .Timmy—
but the interesting pair have quarrelled over
the Government’s proposals for redistribut-
ing the Assembly seats. The present distri-
bution dates back to 1910 —according to a
pleasant tradition it originated in the then
Premier producing a huge electoral map
when his followers were in caucus assembled
and announcing, with a cheerful grin, that
the boundaries were at their disposal. So
lopsided has it grown in the course of years
that at the last appeal to the people there
were more electors in Canning (10.141)
than in Roebourne (GOO), Pilbara (694),
Menzies (724), Cue (799), Mt. Margaret
(839), Mt. Leonora (1013), Yilgarn
(1085), Murchison (1211), Mt. Magnet
(1306) and Kanowna (1431) combined.
Mitchell’s plan is to wipe out four goldfields
seats and divide them between Perth and the
cocky districts. But the Opposition regards
the four seats as A.L.P. property, and before
it is dissevered from them all Hell will roar.
Britain has composed its war-loan troubles
with Uncle Samuel. It owes him a shade
under a thousand million pounds. (Other
nations, France chiefly, owe Britain twice
as. much, but they are not worrying.) The
principal is to be paid back in 62 years, start-
ing with about five millions and working up
to nearly 40 millions a year, and interest
is to be 3 p.c. for 10 years and 3£ p.c. there-
after—with the right, of course, to pay off
the whole thing in a lump. The interest
isn’t what Uncle is used to; on the other
hand, the debt isn’t the sort Uncle is used
to. Evidently he had some small qualms
about it himself when he reflected that it
was incurred in fighting a war which he
subsequently adopted as his own.
Evidently the Age will not give Bruce
much help. On the day after he had been
sent for by the Governor-General, it re-
printed portion of an election-speech where-
in he stated that he would sink or swim
with Hughes, and also mentioned that “the
Country party is run by the most paralysing
H.C.L.
“Mr. Morgan (Southern Colliery Proprietors) said he wished to show how unnecessarily men laid col-
lieries idle. Un the 16th of last month a man was taken to the hospital. He died on Wednesday night,
and to-day the miners laid the colliery idle. They would do so again to-morrow, on the plea of wanting
to attend the funeral. No one would object to the men attending the funeral or closing the mine for
half a day to enable them to do so, but there would be two days’ idleness while there were a couple
of steamers at Kembla unable to complete loading. Thousands of pounds were lost in this way every
year. He was positive that not 30 per cent, of the men would attend the funeral.”

leaders—-men who are incapable of leading.”
“If they obtained power,” he added, “they
would lead the country to disaster.” Under-
neath this was published a report of a meet-
ing of the Bendigo branch of the Farmers’
Union which stated that Bruce was “little
better than Hughes” and was branded
among the Cookies as “the Calico King.”
The Syme organ has always been uneasy
about him on account of his connection with
Flinders-lane.
It’s an ill wind that blows nobody good.
The German mark used to be worth about 20
to the £; before the Ruhr trouble it went
to over 50,000, and now is somewhere about
200,000. When it was in the neighborhood
of 300 a tremendous business was done in
the mark: Germans sold hundreds of mil-
lions of them abroad for good foreign money
—dollars, English pounds, and Dutch and
Swiss currency—and kept the latter abroad.
The foreign buyers now have the marks —
worth next to nothing—-while the Germans
have the good foreign currency, and it is this
which enabled them to come into the Aus-
tralian wool market last week and bid
against Yorkshire and Japan, the two prin-
cipal buyers. Se far they haven’t taken any
Australian metals direct; but metals are
going to them through England and are be-
ing paid for with the same money.
It’s a question whether the U.S.A. ever
could be thoroughly depended upon to jump
into a war as an ally and carry it through
energetically. As experience shows, it takes
a special kind of man to win a war, apart
from the actual soldiering, and he is not
the kind of man who is usually found in
power. Other nations could and did change
their leaders after 1914; but the U.S.A.
couldn’t—it had to remain under the hand of
Woodrow Wilson, just as it will have to re-
main under the hand of whatever peace-time
President happens to be in power when any
future war begins. Australia must cultivate
the friendship of the other great white
Power on the Pacific; but it will probably
fall in if it relies upon the U.S.A. jumping
to its help in an emergency. Uncle’s system
of government isn’t designed for quick
jumping in such circumstances.
The corner of Victoria east of the big
mountains is short of a port, and periodically
the natives appeal to the N.S.W. Govern-
ment to “open up” Twofold Bay just across
the border. But a deaf ear has always been
turned to these tempting suggestions, the
fear presumably being that the port of Eden
might grow, and get swelled head, and draw
something away from Sydney. It has taken
a lot of trouble to get Eden down, and the
effort would be wasted if it got up again.
As late as 1909 the foreign and inter-State
shipping entered and cleared (vessels run-
ning to N.S.W. ports not counted) amounted
to 147,885 tons. In 1921 the total was
7582 tons. Why interfere with anything so
perfectly satisfactory as that?
An agriculturist’s kick :
The suggestion (B. 25/l/’23) that the Country
party is Freetrade while the Nationalists and the
Laborites are “pledged to high-tariffism” provokes
a mild protest. There are Freetraders among the
Agrarians, as there are in the other parties (quite
the most rabid Cobdenite in either House is the
deputy-leader of Labor), but the group, as a group,
is committed to the national fiscal policy. When
the sugar duties were under discussion Earle Page
said (Hansaed, Oct. 12, page 3722): “My investi-
gations in the Orient and Java ’ lead me to believe
that £9 6s. Bd. a ton will not be sufficient pro-
tection to enable Australian sugar-growers to com-
pete satisfactorily with their rivals in the East.
Something more than that is necessary.” But a lot
of alleged high-tariffists, 14 of them Labor, voted
against the “something more.”
Writes H. Gregory, M.tI.R. for Swan:—
In The Bulletin of January 25 reference is made
to the attitude I adopted last year, following the
offer to me of a portfolio by the Prime Minister. It
is stated that I strenuously urged my colleagues “to
accept the Prime Minister’s offer of three portfolios
and become cogs in the Nationalists’ wheel,” and
that, “angered at their obstinacy, Gregory resigned
his deputy-leadership.” There is no truth whatever
in this. The following is from Mr. W. G. Gibson,
late secretary and now Deputy-Leader of the party:
It is stated in The Bulletin that Mr. Gregory
urged his colleagues to accept portfolios in ihe
Hughes Adrninistratibn. There is no truth in or jus-
tification for the report. What Mr. Gregory pro-
posed and strongly urged was that, subject to certain
conditions in regard to policy and administration,
the Country party should enter into a truce with the
Government.
The foregoing is explicit as far as it goes.
Still, The Bulletin can’t help adding that
it is fortunate for Mr. Gregory that he re-
fused the offer of a portfolio, and thrice for-
tunate for his party that the truce he recom-
mended was turned down.
It used to be claimed by Labor politicians
that “the workers pay all the taxes.” But
since they have failed to establish the Mil-
lennium _ via borrowing and Government
ownership, a change of front has become
necessary; so now, in order to persuade them
that they get something out of it all, the
cry is that “the workers pay no taxes.”
Theodore, the Queensland word-spinner,
made the allegation at Rockhampton, where
a by-election is in progress and his seedy
crowd is fighting for its life. Said the leader
of the Continuous Ministry:—
The Nationalists say that the people of Queens-
land are the most heavily-taxed people in the
Oommonwealth. It is not true. The mass of the
people pay no tax; only the wealthy section is
heavily taxed. The income-tax is recognised by
economists to be the soundest and most equitable
tax. It never hurts industry, for it is paid out
of surplus profits.
There is not a grazier, planter, cow-cocky
or professional man in Queensland who
hasn’t personally refuted the blithering
assertion that his income-tax is paid out
of surplus profits. The statement also shows
that Theodore isn’t a democrat, for no demo-
crat could justify the existence of a privi-
leged, non-taxpaying class. And a more
effective argument for a reduction of wages
than the testimony of a Labor Premier that
“the mass of the people pay no tax” it
would be impossible to devise.
The defeat of .T. M. Chanter, who is just
on the verge of 78, makes F. W. Bamford the
“father” of the Reps. Bamford is 74 (the
two were born on the same day of the
same month), but he carries his years with
almost boyish aplomb, and his voice, fluently
used in debate, shows that there is a lot of
life in his vocabulary yet. He has had one
short spell of office in Hughes’s scratch
team after the split with Labor, but would
probably prefer to be Chairman of Commit-
tees now. For the Speakership there will be
a scramble. The job is worth about £l9OO,
which is oply £2OO short of what the Prime
Minister collects.
A Speck Economy Board has reported that
£45,809 p.a. could be saved in salaries by
reorganising the Government departments,
and £54,903 p.a. in other ways. Wasted efforts
were found in nearly all the departments.
Faulty methods were as numerous as holes
in a colander. The document is strewn
with sinister references to retrenchment; and
now the Tas. civil servant tremblingly awaits
his Mussolini.
“D.P. J.”: One Sydney paper says the
New State movement is practically dead,
and that its leaders are seceding owing to
poor attendances at the meetings. The fact
is the Northerners are already convinced of
the necessity for a New State, and do not
see the use of rolling up to meetings to hear
views with which they are unequivocally in
accord. That there has been no diminution
of enthusiasm when enthusiasm is worth
while was demonstrated by the Federal elec-
tions. Victor Thompson, hon. sec. of the
movement, relying almost solely on his New
State principles, defeated a man who had
the Nationalist machinery behind him; and
in the most Northern constituency a young
returned soldier and a fervent New Stater,
practically a stranger in his electorate, de-
feated the most able and trusted of the Prime
Minister’s henchmen. And not a candidate
in a northern constituency had the temerity
to express himself as opposed to New State-
ism.

BALLADE OF A RETIRING STATESMAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Must I retire? Plots, secret vows
Have brought to pass this dread decree!
Surely my greatest foe allows
The Empire still has need for me.
In matters of high policy
The greatest mind should dominate;
Why can’t we Nationalists agree
I am the man to rule the State?
The Liberals made strange kow-tows
Before their joss of liberty;
And caused more strife and party rows
With stunts against expediency
Than Labor’s masked artillery.
This country would deserve its fate
If such men gained to power, perdie!
I am the man to rule the Stat 3.
And who are these, the Bush low-brows,
Cockies who talk so loud and free?
Let them go back and milk their cows
(And rinse their milk-cans carefully),
Peed pigs and plough and grub the tree,
And stick to jobs appropriate
To way-back Ziffs of low degree!
I am the man to rule the State.
Envot.
One man alone, O Powers that be,
Can keep the foe without the gate.
I am the man of destiny,
I am the man to rule the State.

On only two other occasions—in 1911 and
1914—have profits been larger than those
disclosed for the latest financial year. Fol-
lowing upon the £32.726 loss in 1921, the
latest performance is surprising. The re-
covery is accounted for, in part, by the big
improvement in the wool market; but
£380,000 more capital has been got in since
the 1920 balance, and the old Hill-Clark
business was acquired as from July 1, 1921.
That purchase is reported to have given
“eminently satisfactory” results. After pay-
ing 10 p.c. for the past year £79,855 of
surplus profit remained, and visible reserves
have been restored to within £13,000 of the
total when £25,000 of internal accumula-
tions were brought to light to help fill por-
tion of the gap made by losses and the 10
p.c. divs. distributed. Last year’s gross pro-
fits (£325,211) were £48,000 better than those
for 1920, and, as usual, they represented the
balance “after providing for bad and doubt-
ful debts and other contingencies.”
Since 1915 balance-sheet figures have
moved in this way:—
1915. 1921. 1922.
Liabilities.. .. £408,660 £338,094 £373,757

ties, stock, etc.. . 2,413,047 2,339,967 2,483,721

ments . . . . 645,680 675,369 727,509
Premises.. .. 204,263 275,724 330,075
These figures tell how very snug the co.’s
position is nowadays: all current liabilities
at June 30 last totalled £373,757, but on the
other side there was £337,161 in cash and
short loans, and British and Commonwealth
Government securities with a book value of
£390,347. The Government holdings were
written down to market value at each bal-
ance, but the appreciation of the securities
since has not been taken credit for in the
accounts. At June 30 last this £390,348 of
paper had a market value of £423,910, and
there was an internal reserve of no less
than £33,562 attached to it. A feature of
the A.M.L.F. is that it has the use of
£1,898,640 of perpetual stock, a little carry-
ing 3 p.c., but most of it 4 p.c. Nowadays
that is very cheap money, and an important
factor in assisting profits. Besides, there are
visible reserves of £584,411 to help the
£900,000 of paid capital.

This co. has struck a cold spell: the frozen-
meat export trade has been very slack,
and prices will have to improve con-
siderably before a revival can be ex-
pected.. But the co. has had fair
handlings of butter and eggs for export, and
it is depending on that trade and the storage
of fruit and poultry to till the corners of ; ts
refrigerators. Under agreement with the
Coastal Farmer’s Co-op. it is now providing
additional accommodation to handle that
concern’s poultry trade. As a side-line it
caters for the ice-skater with its Glaciarium,
and does well during the season. For the
past year the co. set aside the same
amount for depreciation as in 1921, so
it did not do at all badly, and though the
div. rate was only 3J p.c. the doubling of
capital three years ago must be taken into
consideration. During the past six years
this improvement has been effected in the
liquid position :
1916. 1921. 1922.
Liquid assets .. £11,427 £23,655 £17,683 £16,852

Excess liabilities £11,46(9 £2,527 - -
Surplus assets . . —• £l,lOO £5,208
That liquid surplus of £5208 is no doubt
being cut into by additions now being made to
storage space. Some of the liquid assets may
also be required presently for replacement of
wasting assets. Appropriations for depre-
ciation in the past have been liberal, and
evidently the difference between written-down
values and actual worth of assets provided
most of the bonus scrip. In view of the
slump in the export of meat and rabbits, the
directors probably regret having issued so
much new paper in the reconstruction. The
affairs of a co. which pays only 3$ p.c.
divs. are liable to be misunderstood by people
who don’t know the circumstances.

The depression in numerous trades and in-
dustries does not appear to have bothered
this co. much. While other retailers have
found difficulty in shifting their stocks, often
on a smaller-profit margin, Nicholson’s con-
tinues to disclose net earnings at the rate of
£21,000-odd per annum, which is better than
it was doing when the war prosperity was
in full bloom. This suggests that, despite
the troublesome times, there are more
people who can afford to buy pianos, if only
on the t.-p. plan, than there used to be.
But the co. has had a good deal of luck dur-
ing the past 18 months —or, perhaps, the
understanding is more honorable among
piano-dealers than in other retail trades. The
local market was flooded with pianos as well
as other goods during the early months of
1921, and this co. found itself with stocks and
t.-p. balances wdth a book value of £127,000
larger than paid capital. Consequently, it
had to lean heavily on the bank and others.
These goods were, no doubt, an expensive
lot, but the co. succeeded in placing them
with the customary good margin of profit,
and by September 30 last stocks and t.-p.
balances had been reduced from £319,740 to
£201.700. Meantime liabilities had .been
met in this way :

Lamson-Paragon did better for the past 12
months than the accounts show. During
the year the Westralian branch was amal-
gamated with a local stationery business
and floated into a separate co. It showed
“good results” for the year, but when
the L.P. accounts were made up it had not
distributed a div. Consequently, on this
occasion, the co.’s profits have not been
assisted by earnings in the West. On the
other hand, the profits in the table include
£1334 disclosed profit on sale of this busi-
ness to the subsidiary co., and that amount
has been employed to extinguish goodwill
from the balance-sheet. But some goodwill
may still be included indirectly in the item
“Shares in other cos., £13,334.” Not in-
cluding the profits from the Westralian float,
the co. made a net profit of £11,298, which
was a return of 15 p.c. on paid capital. The
surplus available after paying 10 p.c. to
shareholders has not only made good the
£3553 excess of divs. over profits when the
management wrote down the book value of
stocks at the 1921 balance, but has put re-
serves £l6OO in advance of the total of two
years ago. When the co. started in 1909 —
to take over a proprietary which had run
the business for 30 years—£7446 of the
paid capital of £30,125 was represented by
goodwill items. Nowadays paid capital is
£75,000, and there are net tangible assets
for the whole of that and £17,105 more.
The business has been very successfully ex-
panded : in the process divs. have climbed
from 8 to 10 p.c., with still a good margin
of surplus profit going to reserve. Liabili-
ties at October 31 totalled £5876, and there
was cash on hand for all except a few hun-
dreds of that. Stocks, book debts and cash
amounted to £48,170, the accounts showing
a surplus of liquid assets over liabilities of
£42,294. Other assets were the £13,334 in-
terest in the Westralian subsidiary, £lB,BBO
of property and plant, machinery, etc., writ-
ten down to £21,347.

Several years after this old-establish'ed print-
ing and stationery business had been bought
out by a public co., it was found to have
been, over-capitalised, and in 1914 the 75,000
£1 fully-paids were reduced to 12s. each,
paid capital being written down to £45,000.
The co. then made a good recovery, but five
years after the writing-down, and following
upon steadily-rising markets and a trade
boom, the directors decided to have another
reconstruction. Assets were revalued and
were claimed to be worth approximately
£33,800 more than the figures at which they
were shown in the books, a valuation of
£7522 was placed upon “goodwill” and these
book surpluses together with £12.590 of
accumulated profit were converted into scrip,
paid capital being elevated from the written-
down £45,000 to £lOO,OOO, the latter in £1
fully-paids once more. Any justification
the directors thought existed for this sudden
inflation of capital has not been borne out
by performances since. In the first year
after the reconstruction the co. appeared to
have done magnificently, the net profit repre-
senting 12i p.c. on the enlarged capital.
But that was the last of the war-boom years.
In 1921 the co. failed to earn 5 p.c., and
for the past 12 months it has just squeezed
6 p.c. That, of course, is a good return
to old holders, to whom it matters
little if their scrip is turned out of
machines like marks and roubles. It is the
return on their original cash outlay that
concerns them. But the outsider has to
ponder whether the £1 scrip available for
him on the market is actually worth the
20s. which the published accounts claim.
Whether the 1920 valuations have persisted in
W. E. Smith’s The Bulletin cannot say,
but a co. which earns barelv 6 p.c. must
expect its shares to be at a discount on the
market. At October 31 the financial posi-
tion was snug: liabilities amounted to
£7164, and there was £12,182 of cash on
hand. Book debts, investments and sun-

This co. has been the Federal Deposit Bank
since 1908; prior to that it was the Federal
Land, Building and Investment Society and
a victim of the boom, paid capital having
dwindled from £150,000 to £27,868. But
that is all ancient history, and now of
no concern except as a warning for the
future. The business so revived that there
have been large margins of surplus profit
after distributing 12 p.c. divs. on capital,
which has expanded to £46,770 with the aid
of £12,151 of transferred reserves. Addi-
tional capital is to be raised during the
current year, and at September 30 share-
holders had paid £8976 of calls in advance.
How the co.’s business has grown is shown
by this comparison of balance-sheet figures :
1915. 1920. 1921. 1922.

Deposits, etc. .. 59,552 97,211 69,195 100,600
In seven years advances have increased from
£86,030 to £301,366, and there has been no
shortage of funds from the public to enable
even a larger business to be handled. A
feature of the Federal is the large amount
of borrowed money which is not employed in
building operations. Of the £379,859 of
deposits and other debts at September 30 no
less than £100,270 was in the ordinary trad-
ing banks, and £56,605 more was in Govern-
ment securities, stocks and shares. That sug-
gests that approximately £lOO,OOO of the bor-
rowings cannot be earning anything for the
co. It is unlikely that the management can
attract deposits at smaller interest than the
bank pays. During the past 12 months
depositors obliged with £77,802 more, but
£31,489 of this increase was placed for safe-
keeping with other banks. The necessity
for the large cash balances is not made clear
by the accounts, but everything depends on
the terms on which deposits are taken and
on the volume of repayments by borrowers.
Of course, if a large portion of the money bor-
rowed is at the call of depositors, a substan-
tial cash holding is essential. Anyway, the
cash and public securities made the position
sounder for creditors. At September 30
£157,205 of £379,859 of liabilities was
within easy reach. That left £222,654 to
be supported by advances with a book value
of £301,366, and the £13,407 of premises,
etc. —assets equal to 28s. per £1 of borrowed
money not backed by liquid assets.

That 12| p.c. is the best the Perpetual has
given shareholders in 38 years. In the early
nineties it was paying 10 p.c. comfortably,
then the management discovered that its
investments—seven-tenths mortgages—had
been badly damaged in the smash. No divs.
were paid for several years, but mild dis-
tributions followed the writing-down of capi-
tal by about £15,000. The div. rate was
kept down while reserves accumulated, and
after the latest distribution to shareholders
reserves were only £l5OO short of the paid
capital of £30,000. Assuming that invest-
ments turn in only a trifle more than 4 p.c.
net, that would give 8 p.c. on capital. Pro-
bably they are earning more than that. So
with the profit from trustee operations share-
holders should be assured of good divs. The
extent of estates in this office’s care is not
known : it is one of the few trustee cos. which
do not disclose trust figures. That it has
made good progress is clear from a compari-
son of gross earnings: last year’s £14,881 of
commissions, rents and interest on invest-
ments was almost double the figures of a
dozen years ago. The co.’s own larger funds
and dearer money have, of course, helped the
expansion. On the other side, expenses have
moved at greater pace: trustee cos. have to
do more to earn their commissions than thev
used to, and taxes are also heavier. Profit
and Loss entries compare as follows for a
number of years :

The E., S. and A. Bank and some other
cos. with headquarters in England pay divs.
free of British income-tax. This suits the
British shareholders very well, but Austra-
lians have long been restive about it. In
the net result one rate of dividend is paid to
British and another and smaller one to Aus-
tralian shareholders. Representations have
been made by many individual shareholders,
but the only satisfaction they have got has
been that “the Board feels that the present
practice is in the best interests of the general
body of shareholders.” It no doubt is advan-
tageous to the British shareholder that his
dividend should come to him net and not
gross, since it reduces —or, at any rate, may
reduce—the percentage which he has to pay
by way of income-tax on his taxable income ;
but that does not alter the fact that the Bri-
tish shareholder gets something out of his
investment which the Australian shareholder
misses, and that the co. pays it out of money
in which proprietors are supposed to share
strictly in proportion to their holdings. And
to the Australian this is not made any the
more agreeable by the fact that most of the
divisible profit is made in Australia. Fresh
representations have recently been made to
two or three Boards in London; but there
is no cohesion among the people interested,
and the prospect of any sudden change in
the highly questionable practice is not bril-
liant.

“Toots”: Kintore, ex-Governor of South
Aus., is still chairman of Sulphide Corpora-
tion. He is burly and forceful, and dares to
say a great deal more than any Australian
chairman thinks his shareholders should
know. At June 30 last co. owned to a sur-
plus of liquid assets exceeding £700,000. By
mid-December £200,000 more had been
pouched. Not bad going for a show which
ought to have gone on the rocks if the
working conditions imposed by the Edmunds
award were so impossible as some people
alleged. Of course, the Corp. has had better
metal prices and super, to help it. Kintore
lays all sorts of unction on the mine because
in 23 years the prefs. have averaged 13| p.c.
p.a. divs., and the ordinaries more than 10
p.c., and a large surplus of assets has
meanwhile been accumulated. But there
have been some anxious moments in the co.’s
career. Early in the proceedings a lot of
the capital was written off as lost, and it
was never afterwards restored. After that
there was anxiety over the big creep, and
again before the German metal-buyers got
the Prop, into line over the lead and zinc
conventions, and. later still, when magnetic
separation was not doing the expected with
zinc concentrates. The change over from
Cockle Creek to Port Pirie has cut costs and
smoothed the way to an understanding over
selling products. Lead is just where the
fat man wants it.

Though the first shipment of drilling plant
for Okes-Durak Oil Co. (W.A.) reached
Wyndham early last August, superintendent
H. F. Kessal will be lucky if he can start
drilling before next month. Transport has
been the big problem: the seven waggons
with the first gear had an indifferent track
to negotiate, including 18 crossings of rivers
and creeks. Broken axles, collapsed wheels
and capsizes were experienced, and the wag-
gons averaged 50 days to cover the 195 miles
from Wyndham. The drilling party started
on the job in mid-October, and by Christmas
were almost ready to commence boring. But
the wet season set in, and essential gear is
still held up at the Orel River.

Field work on the Lander oil areas, near
Orallo, Roma (Q.), is almost completed.
Milsom, Jensen (brother of the doctor) and
Ted Finch have been on the job most of the
time since the beginning of December. It
is claimed that prospects have been enhanced
by the surface surveys, several promising
structures having been located. The first
bore-sites have been selected.

“Physico-chemist’s” views about oil:
Perhaps because of the optimism of “Talpa” (B.
18/l/’23) regarding the prospects of finding oil in
payable quantities in Australia, there are a good
many factors that he has overlooked. When oil
was first found, the scientific theory to account
for its presence was that it was produced from
organic debris, by a process akin to that of dry
distillation. But within the last few years
the theory has been revised, and the hypothesis is
now very different. Briefly, it is that the oil strata
have resulted because of the action of steam on the
metallic carbide deposits, an essential factor being
enormous pressure to which the steam was sub-
jected. This pressure can be derived from only one
source, namely, the weight of neighboring mountain-
ranges. Thus the oilfields of Pennsylvania and the
Eastern United States come under the mountain-
pressure influences of the Alleghanies, etc. ; those of
Bakersfield are subjected to the pressures of the Western
Rockies; the fields in Texas to the same. The
Mexican fields are obtained from the influences of
the Northern Andes, those of Persia and Russia from
those of the Urals. The recently-discovered oil-
field in Western China is right at the foot of one
of the greatest and highest spur ranges in the
whole of Asia, and before the boring necessary to
locate it had been carried out, its existence had
been predicted by geologists because of its situation
in relation to these mountains. The main thing
about all this is that it would seem to diminish
the possibility of there being oil deposits in the
Commonwealth, or, rather, of there being any to
the extent that there are in all oil-bearing countries
of America and Asia. Australia possesses no
mountain ranges that can be compared with those
of those parts of the world. On the other hand,
the chances are much greater in New Guinea, on
account of the presence there of the Kaiserin Augusta
and Owen Stanley Ranges, not to mention the
mountains in Dutch New Guinea. Incidentally,
“Talpa” was incorrect in stating that the chief
of the U. S. Geological Survey estimated that
Australia’s quota of the world's oil resources was
4,000,000,000 barrels. He put that amount as the
problematical quota of the Pacific basin, and in
doing so he probably had in mind the possibilities
of New Guinea.
* * *
“O.B.”: So great is the lure of oil in
London that millions are available for the
development of any proved field, and this
notwithstanding the many failures of
the past few years. All the big oil oper-
ating cos. which carry on all branches
of the trade, from the production of crude
to the delivery of refined products to the
consumer, have their eyes on Australia. If
oil is struck in the Commonwealth they
might try and buy in at their own price.
Some optimists reckon that rather than be
left, the Standard, Persian and Royal
Dutch cos. will rush to get in at any price.
But I have my doubts.

A month ago Fremantle Smelters were
hung up because of the engineers’ strike;
now Belgian competition, backed by longer
hours, lower wages and depreciated exchange,
has shut them down altogether. _ The
smelters’ biggest customer, the Surprise, at
Northampton, made a contract for a year
ahead with an Antwerp firm for the sale of
lead concentrates at £3 per ton more than
the local co. could afford to give. As a
result, 100 men at Fremantle have lost their
jobs, and about the same number are work-
less at Northampton, where the Fremande
co. has been obliged to cease lead produc-
tion owing to the impossibility of carrying
on smelting without the support of the Sur-
prise.

Hampton Properties, Edinburgh, has
issued a report extolling the prospects of
Block 45 (VV.A.). The lode at 200 ft. is
claimed to be worth lldwt. for a width of
12ft., and a trial crushing is promised early.
The capacity of the mill is 1000 tons per
month. To begin with, it is intended to
treat 1000 tons, and a profit of £1 per ton is
expected. Favorable mention is also made
of the Celebration, in which Hampton Prop-
erties has a big holding and to which it
has lent £2500. Despite a serious shortage
of water Celebration has more than paid
its way during the last few months, but it
won’t be able to do that for long. Unless
money is found to provide adequate water
for crushing, and at present the co. hasn’t
the necessary funds to do it, closing down
at an early date seems inevitable. The show
deserves a better fate. Values were good
down to 50ft., payable at 100 ft., and poor
at 200 ft., but they show a substantial im-
provement at 300 ft. and they may be better
still at 400 ft. Shareholders would be ill-
advised to give up before reaching and prov-
ing that level.

Kalgurli (W.A.) has been re-opened by
its new owner, the Oroya Links C°-> an d
tributes have been let from the surface down
to 1700 ft. Already a few good parcels
have been taken out, and according to the
local inspector of mines a large tonnage is
likely to be extracted in the next 12 months
from above the 100 ft. level. The mill on the
mine is running full time with the assistance
of crushings from the Oroya Brownhill,
Associated Northern, North Kalgurli and
Paringa blocks.

Associated’s Keeley mine (Canada) pro-
duced G90,7000z. silver during the 11 months
ended November last, and also won much
cobalt from the ore. Chairman Hamilton
announces that when the distribution of
Keeley shares to Associated holders takes
place it may be coupled with a div. The
Kalgoorlie mine, he says, has still unex-
hausted possibilities.
* * * #
Sydney people controlling the Lloyd
George, at Coolgardie (W.A.), have decided
to add a 10-head battery to the Huntingdon
mill, and to list the co. on the stock
exchanges. The show has been crushing well
for some time, and the lode in the bottom
workings is of good value and large.
“Fine Gold” (W.A.) : Some months ago two
or three small crushings were obtained from
the old Lalla Rookh mine at Marble Bar,
and a co. has since been formed to acquire
it. There is some gold left in the show, but
the reef is not good enough to make divs. for
a company.

The sale of the Bellevue plant. Mt. Sir
Samuel, to Sons of Gwalia recalls things.
The Bellevue was at one time reckoned to
have the longest, biggest and (in the opinion
of some) best shoot of gold in the West.
But ore treatment troubles started early, and
after three reconstructions the co. aban-
doned operations. Over half-a-million pounds’
worth of gold was won, but shareholders got
nothing, and lost ail their capital besides,
* * * *
Mr. Elliott (Q.) dropped back £22,121
last financial year because of the cost of
upkeep at idle mines and plant. Assets now
are mostly of the fixed variety ; at June 30
last stocks were down to £41)00, ore at grass
“on valuation” to £11,400, and other odd-
ments amounted to only £l3OO. These assets
were only a speck in a balance-sheet which
aggregated £1,285,879. Debts at the bal-
ancmg-date were: Loan accounts and inter-
est, £42,776; sundry creditors, £27,854;
overdraft, £12,658. The Board proposes to
invite £500,000 of new capital to help the
present total of £1,202,590. No pap from
Corbould is in the menu this time, because
with the mines idle nothing fresh can be
said. Mt. Elliott has to delay a resumption
until it can get a railway to Mt. Oxide, or
till the copper market improves. When
conditions do brighten it ought to gobble up
its hard-up neighbor, Mt. Cuthbert. In
1921 Mt. Elliott had liquid assets consisting
of stocks in hand £29,611, Queensland Gov-
ernment bonds £30,000, ore £11,400 and
minor items £l7OO to set against loans, etc.,
£37,251, sundry creditors £24,105 and over-
draft £32,741, so that it was short on liquid
assets by £23,086. That was after it had
recorded a loss of £22,178, due in part to
£9058 written off for depreciation—a pro-
vision not made in the 1922 accounts.
* * * *
For the last quarter of 1922 Queensland’s
mineral yield was on the up-grade, with
copper on top with 2039 tons, worth
£128,665, of which Mt. Morgan supplied
1630 tons. The Cloncurry gougers got out
tons, worth £10,570. Herberton and
Chiilagoe produced the bulk of the 111,2840 z.
silver recorded. Lead totalled 1428 tons
valued at £37,035; Chiilagoe supplied 1320
tons, and Silver Spur and indooroopilly were
very low down in the list. The Girofia was
the leading lead-mine, w.th the Consols next.
Alluvial and lode tin was worth £24,382
(249 tons), with Kangaroo Hills and Iler-
berton sharing the honors. The State
arsenic-mine produced 150 tons of the total
of 177 tons. Rare metals scarcely figured,
although molybdenite shows have made a
start and should figure on the present quar-
ter’s returns.
Queensland Mines Minister Jones has
been getting into hot water over the purchase
of Newcastle coke for the Chiilagoe State
smelters. Mt. Mulligan had the contract,
and southern coke was only called in to
fill the breach, although North Ipswich
offered 800 tons stocks on hand. If there’s
any culprit it is P. L. Goddard, g.m. of the
smelters, who refuses to put 25 p.c. of dirt
into his smelting charges, besides which it
is poor business; with coastal freights high,
to transport dirt over 1000 miles. It also
upsets smelting efficiency, and Goddard wants
fuel in the vicinity of 15 or 16 p.c. ash
when he can get it. # #
“Met”: During its latest run, extending
over some 14 weeks, the Great Northern (Q.)
public battery crushed 743 tons tor 114 tons
tin concentrates, averaging 15.3 p.c. There
were 21 parcels from 10 different claims. I
think it’s a record for any public battery in
Australia, as the average value per ton was
£l5 Bs. The king crushing was from the
Irishman—32s tons for 49 tons 15cwt. of
tin. An interesting feature of this is that
the concentrates assayed 73.8 p.c. metallic
tin; and as the stone was obtained from
something like 300 ft. in the sulphide zone,
it sounds well for deep mining in Herberton.
* * * *
Loch Fyne, Matlock (Vic.), with John
Friel in charge, has still to be shaped.
Under Fred Tricks the shoots of quartz in
the dyke yielded divs., and the job of the
last 20 years has been to pick up fresh runs
of gold underfoot. The present co. has put
£10,500 into plant and £27,000 into working
account, and cannot say it is on top yet. The
last six months were spent adding to plant
and pushing on with No. 2 level till it was
under the reef. It took 79ft. of rising to
reach it, so it is running flat. So far the
vein is 3ft. to Bft. wide, and that will give
Friel the crushing stuff he yearns after. He
has also been hunting along a run of stone
cut nearer the shaft, but it was of the short-
dvke type. He now plans to reach the west
wall of the basin, where the best shoots

“M.E.” : It is hardly a stretch of imagina-
tion to suggest that there may be a goldfield
within the area of the city of Melbourne.
-Geological features are much in favor of
such an assumption, and actual discoveries
support it. A deep liftwell hole had to be
sunk at Fink’s skyscraper in Elizabeth-
street, and this passed through a formation
of quartz spurs in which gold was seen—one
very fair specimen with coarse specks of gold
was" shown to me. I have also seen gold in
spurs in an old-time cutting in Flinders-
street East. The same Silurian rock system
with which the rich goldfields on the north-
ern side of the Dividing Range are associ-
ated exist on the southern fall, but in the
latter case it is only in isolated places that
the sedimentary strata are showing, hun-
dreds of square miles being covered with
basalt. I have seen a decent prospect or
gold taken from a cemented wash deposit
as close to Melbourne as Oakleigh, and also
on the Sunbury plains, where a creek has
cut through the basalt. The nearest actual
workings to Melbourne were at Templestowe,
not far from Heidelberg, where a gold-
antimony lode exists. Warrandyte, further
alone on the Yarra, has at times. been a
very productive field, and from this point
to the north and west there is a large area
of proved auriferous ground. Ander-
son’s Creek, in the Warrandyte district, was
the location of one of the earliest alluvial
diggings, and it is supposed that the deep
ground in the Yarra flats is very rich in
places, but is quite unworkable owing to the
existence of large volumes of water. Several
projects have been mooted and money has
always been available for driving a long
drainage tunnel, but the Government has
persistently refused to sanction the en t er "
prise on the ground that the contemplated
mining operations would pollute the pel-
lucid stream.
» * * *
The chief mining officer of the Federated
Malay States reports that the major por-
tion of the rich alluvial tin flats have already
been worked, and he predicts that the future
scope of operations will
tend more and more to large scale working; of poor
deposits. It is quite conceivable that much of the
ground already dredged will be dredged again. New
and cheaper methods of working on a large scale
may be introduced. With the exhaustion of the flats
the hills will be tackled. Not by the “hand-to-hand”
methods now employed by the Chinese, but with the
help of ample and cheap power, by pumping water at
a high pressure through “monitors,” washing down
all the decomposed ground, extracting the ore, and
dumping the detritus in huge (Jams built on the
worked-out flats below.
This will irevitably lead to the exposure of any
lodes or lode-like formations there may be in the
rock. Many such are known, but the ore occurs more
in the form of disseminated grains through the
granite than in the usual form of a lode or vein.
A Sydney man who recently visited Malaya
says’ that he saw formations where the de-
composed granite had been washed away,
leaving veins of cassiterite like the ribs of
a skeleton. In many parts of New England
(N.S.W.I tin veins were left standing in
this way. In Tasmania and the Upper
Murray mountains there are large deposits
of granite carrying tin in minute particles,
but success has not attended efforts to work
these on a large scale. At the Grampian
Hills, near Emmaville (N.S.W.), there are
several wide tin “stock-works,” and the co.
operating there expects to make some good
discoveries when the nozzles remove the
overlying loam.

“10-2-4” : The world is full of braggarts,
and in journalism the latest to become mani-
fest in more or less epidemic form (these
things, like certain words and phrases, run
in cycles) is the impostor who moulds his
style on the Bible. “You c’n : have your best-
sellers, old man,” says young Herb Blinks,
of the Howl, “but they’re no good to me.
Do you know the one book from which I
get unfailing satisfaction and inspiration in
the literary sense?” Having secured the re-
quired answer, he proceeds: “The Bible, old
son._ Mind you, I don’t hold with religion.
I bin an ignostic ever since I learned to
reason. It’s the literary flavor, the style,
the —the beauty that gets me. ‘Well of Eng-
lish pure and undefired,’ and all that kind

HER: “Yes — hut not to the same man.”
of thing. Only yesterday the chief said to
me: ‘I wanner compliment you, Mr. Blinks,
on the way you wrote up that Campbell-
street assault affair. The police must be
protected.’ D’yer know what it was that hit
the old bird? My style. Simple, yet at the
same time sublime. Biblical! Oh. boy, I
guess I know That ole book as well as any
parson in the country; an’ yet, as I said
before, I regard the religious side of it as
the purest bunk.” There is this, to be said
for the misguided lad: in his own dim way
he glimpses the light. Half-aware that he
is being corrupted mentally beyond hope
by the Yankee gibberish which shouts at
him from every film, from thousands of adver-
tisements, and from half the books and
paper he reads, he has the grace to be
ashamed.
“The It.” : The aerial mail service between
Perth and N.-W. Australia has its uses ; the
carrying of medicine to isolated parts is one.
And sometimes the air-carrier arrives with
something more precious than mere physic.
A lady on the air-track between Geraldton
and Broome (W.A.) recently ordered a dress
from Perth that was to dazzle all the dwell-
ers in the district at the local annual races.
The order was given late, however, and it
soon became clear that there was no chance
of getting up the frock by steamer in time
for the great event. It was finally arranged
that the garment should be picked up at
Geraldton and brought on per air; and it was
delivered in time to paralyse the course and
enable the local paper to refer to it as
ethereal.

“Sargon”: With regard to the awarding
of the Archibald prize of £4OO for the best
portrait of the year, an objection to the pre-
sent method strikes this Victorian. When
the award is made by the same individuals
each year, it naturally follows that the.
prize will go always to the same class of
work, perhaps even to the same painter. The
more sincerely the trustees admire work of
a given style, the less chance is there that
any other type of work can succeed; their
very consistency and honesty will tend to
bring about a uniform result, and the award
will be a foregone conclusion. If the terms
of the bequest allow it, the remedy would
be for the trustees to appoint yearly the
strongest inter-State committee that can be
formed of painters not competing to act
with them; such committee to be varied as
far as practicable from year to year. Other-
wise there is danger of the fund’s providing
a dependable income for one man, which
can hardly be the result contemplated by
the donor.

“F. Clinton”: There were some fine sur-
veyors in the early days. Handicapped
though they were by rough instruments, then-
work in the wildest country was wonderfully
accurate. Recently in the Monaro it be-
came necessary to check one of the boun-
daries of an old portion which comprised
mountains and swamp. The marks at the
corners had completely disappeared. One
corner in the swamp was shown on the old
plan as marked by a peg. After careful
measurements, the check surveyor directed
his men to ”se the spear at a spot he indi-
cated in the swampy soil. The first thrust
located the old peg-—which, incidentally,
when brought to the surface showed the
marks of the axe as clearly as if they had
been made a week previous instead of 80
years ago.

“Uramao”: _ Not Malapropisms, but
flowers of diction, culled at the hustings
during the recent elections in Maoriland.
One speaker, a builder, in an apologetic
tone, said: “I feel I am more fit for the scaf-
fold than for making a speech.” Another
true democrat uncompromisingly declared:
"I do not want to see the man born with a
silver spoon in his mouth given preference
over those with a pick-and-shovel in theirs.”
“Ragar” : “G.’s” remarks re the
crayfish beloved of the evening
drunk (B. 21/12./’22) brought me
fond memories of Capetown, which
I recently left. The pubs there are
open until 10 p.m., and the hugest
cray imaginable can be purchased
for a bob. The claws—really the
best part of the bird —are sold at
3d. and 4d. per dozen, and the
merry soul abrim with beer, when
he hears the soul-searing reminder
of “Time, gents, please,” can
always assuage his grief with a
pocketful of claws ere he heads for
home and wife or mother, as the
case may be. _ What with three-
penny beers, dirt-cheap crays and
the bars awash till 10 p.m., there
are worse places in the world to
live in than under the shadow of
Table Mountain.
“S.T.S.”: A pleasant Malaprop touch was
passed to me long ago by J. C. F. Johnson,
once Minister of Education in S.. Aus.
According to his yarn, a Sydney man had
died a little while after starting in business
in Adelaide. “I believe he is very well con-
nected over there,” said a reporter. “Don’t
say it unless you know,” Johnson advised.
There was no time to make sure, or else a
telegram was thought a waste of money. At
any rate, the newspaper stated next day that
deceased was “reputedly the son of the Hon.
So-and-So, of N.S.W.”
* * * *
“W.W.A.”: The other week a N. S. Wales
publican was fined £5 for refusing to supply
a meal when one was called for. Which
reminds me that years ago. Beauchamp being
then Governor, the Chamber of Commerce
was banqueting him one night at Aarons’s
Exchange Hotel, when two mildly inebri-
ated business men appeared and demanded
dinner. The banquet being in full swing,
and every hotel hand engaged, they were
refused. Presently they reappeared with a
police-sergeant, who endorsed their conten-
tion that the victuals must be supplied.
“That so?” said Aiken, the then manager.
“And does the law compel me to dine them
with the Governor’s party?” “Dine them
where you can,” replied the Force. “Right,”
said Bung, and conducted his importunate
guests to a kitchen littered with unwashed
plates, dishes, kitchen utensils and the
debris of huge quantities of assorted tucker.
“Give these gents, a square feed and charge
them five bob each,” said the director-
NO DANGER.
“I think I'll commit suicide.”
“That's all right, Reggie. I'm not worrying—you never keep a
good resolution.”

15 perspiring cooks were too much for the
unwelcome visitors, and a little later they
were reported at a Dago’s surrounding
“steak da oyst” in quieter sui’roundings.

“Cmsar’s Ghost”: The street-band pest in
Sydney is becoming a mere excuse for cadg-
ing. For this purpose a man who has lost
an arm or a leg in the service of his country
is naturally found most effective. Outside the
block of offices where I pass working hours
a man coaxes melody from a cornet
with damnable frequency, and his collector,
habitually canvassing the buildings, has his
regular victims. One of them remarked the
other day that he hadn’t heard the cornet-
player that morning. “Oh, he ain’t there,”
admitted the collector candidly. “He was
feeling a bit crook, so I gave him the day
off.” In a dazed fashion the victim dropped
his usual contribution into the box, wonder-
ing what it was supposed to be for.

There is a possibility of medical knowledge being
enlarged by the recent archaeological discoveries in
Egypt. They may offer data for the Comparison of
the clinical effects of the diseases of those days with
those of the present. Again, it may be possible to
culture organisms from mummified bodies in the way
that anthrax germs can often be grown from spores
that are many years old, although it remains to be
demonstrated whether cultures can be prepared from
material thousands of years old. If it is possible,
scientists may be able to ascertain whether any
changes of an evolutionary nature have taken place
in the germs. Moreover, it may be that after a
bacteriological examination of the material available
some of the present conceptions of diseases mentioned
in the Old Testament may have to be revised. It
is, for instance, a moot question whether the leprosy
of the Bible was really leprosy or syphilis. Exam-
ination of the bones of people who died 3000 years
ago or thereabouts may be enlightening.

“Kip”: It is generally known that the
Navy drinks the health of the King sitting
down ; but some of the customs of the ward-
room are not so familiar to the longshore-
man. Afloat, it is customary when return-
ing a "shout” to invite one’s companion to
have the “other half,” for, contrary to shore
practice, a drink is not counted as a drink
until the officers’ steward has made his
second tray-laden journey to the hidden
source of supply. Presumably, therefore, a
Jimmy Woodser ranks as only a quarter of
a dririk, but I’m not certain on this point.
Sundays excepted, all the evening meals are
conducted with elaborate ceremony under the
guidance of the mess president’s wooden,
attention-compelling hammer, and each
Saturday night the youngest unmarried mem-
ber of the mess is hauled blushingly to his
feet to the toast of “Our Sweethearts and
Wives.” At mess it is forbidden to mention
a lady’s name, and the transgressor of the
rule is obliged to stand drinks all round. On
many ships the same penalty is incurred by
anyone making use of a foreign language,
however short the phrase. Incidentally, the
old rum-drinking days are now passed, and
the most popular throat-lubricator is that
most despised of all drinks—gin.
“Lungs”: In Syd-
ney no open space is
too lovely or poten-
tially valuable to be
sold or leased to a
syndicate anxious to
exploit it as a circus,
golf links, racecourse
or what not. Some-
times the claim is that
the land is swampy
or otherwise undesir-
able. In this way the
people behind the
Bose Bay Golf Club
got a large tract on
favorable terms, while
Denison Miller and
some friends are after
another metropolitan
area which is also
alleged to be useless
for anything except
golf. But the prize
piece of impudence to
date is the proposal of
a body representing
150 golfers to acquire
the military reserve at
Middle Head for a
private link s. By
almost general consent
this is the harbor’s
prize site and the

from alienating new

near suburbs, the
authorities should be
thinking of resuming

making th e m into

fusion round playing fields, the latter be-
come due, automatically, to be shifted to
their proper sphere—the country.
“N. or M.”: Bellerive, Hobart’s marine

on behalf of an ex-soldier who had been seriously
wounded on Gallipoli. “That is too long ago to

“Eh? Wounded at Gallipoli?”

What happened there, beyond a doubt,
Is too remote to worry about.”

Brothers or sons. The world rolls on.

“Kip”: It was Friday evening, and I was
engaged in inspecting the stock in the seeds-

it was to be Iceland poppies or zinnias, my
attention was diverted by the precipitous
arrival of Binks. As I watched him sway-
ing to and fro, I felt a sudden sympathy for
the man —possibly due to the fact that I
once met Mrs. Binks. Disregarding me, he
pulled up short, apparently attracted by a
large aspidistra, displayed among other pot-
plants on a stand near the doorway ; and his
melancholy eyes lit up with a sudden gleam
of hope. “Strike me, an ashperdislitra—sher

happily, and then, as he managed somehow
to secure the pot-plant: “The wife can’sh

he went serenely on his way. When, next
morning, I came across a shattered pot-plant

He was cross-examining a woman debtor-

“El Verdugo”: “Whitehall” says (B.

marriages, that “before the war blood and

facts of the Laseelles and Bowes-Lyon
alliances. Laseelles is a direct descendant
of Henry VII., and the Lords of Glamis
have passed on an ancient title in the direct
line for 600 years. I doubt whether there
are many cases of that sort in British history.

“Lip’s” vignette: —
On a Manly boat, on Anniversary Day, two ladies
sat beside me, clad in the glad-rags of the ’Loo,
and redolent of Jockey Club and beer. From the
remarks of one of them on the couples who came along
it appeared that her own escortless state rankled. Then
a young man, clutching the arm of a girl, came
to the top of the stairs, caught sight of my neigh-
bors, and hastily disappeared, dragging his consort
with him. The daughter of Eve beside me straight-
ened. “Jer see ’irn?” she demanded of her com-
panion. “Ther dirty cow ! An’ wiv my clobber on
’im! Every stitch ov it bort wiv my money. ’E
said ’e couldn’t come out wiv me ’cos ’e ’ad no

when a portion of the cavalier’s pants was missing
—'“but now he’s done up, oh! she’ll keep comp’ny

“Topee”: Should the Federal authorities
adopt Leason’s suggestion (B. 25/l/’23)
and let H.M.A.S. Australia’s topsides for
billposting space, they can quote pre-
cedent. Prior to
being broken up, in
the early ’eighties,
the huge screw-
cmn-paddle steamer
Great Eastern
was temporarily
acquired by Lewis
and Co., the Liver-
pool clothiers.
After the vessel
had been embel-
lished, inboard and
outboard, by accom-
plished billstickers,
sixpenny trips were
organised by
arrangement with
the Rock Ferry
Co., to cater for
the country trade.
Visitors were met
at the gangways
by selected shop-
walkers attired in
dazzling naval uni-
forms and escorted
round the vessel to
the accompaniment
of Avhat’s-the-next-
article patter. And
trade lecturettes,
delivered in the
saloon, would con-
elude: “T his
stately- vessel has
carried thousands
of miles of valuable
cable in her capa-
cious holds, but she
never carried such
value as we are

“Smike”: An admiring article in Mel-
bourne anent the genius of the police in sup-
pressing the two-upper reminds one that a
notorious expert with the “kip” is still pur-
suing his calling undisturbed. But, then,
it should be mentioned that his “school” has
no permanent place of abode. As soon as
the nightly collection of students begins to be
noticed at one address, he shifts off
to another of half-a-dozen—a proceeding
which is made easy by the fact that he owns
them all. He Las actually established a
circuit in various suburbs, and only he and
his school know where the next gamble is to
be held. In bis small, evasive way he re-
calls John Wren at the height of his emi-
nence as an illegal tote boss, and there is
evidence that he is adopting John’s astute
system of playing the large-hearted philan-
thropist to the poor of his district. In the
suburb where he has his headquarters he
plays Father Christmas at regular intervals,
and his name, which has figured in some
remarkable police cases, is mentioned by his
retainers with a catch in the voice.

“No: it isn’t that.”
“Dial-sight”: Re the fine carriage that
onc-e distinguished the women of the Eng-
lish Midlands (B. 25/l/’23), I nominate
Egypt for far older evidence of the benefits
derived from carrying weights on the head.
The Digger found few pleasanter sights in
the sandy country than a silhouette of dusky
bints walking along the canal banks from
the maize fields at sunset. It was a revela-
tion of what a graceful carriage could be.
Some physical-culture experts in England
advocate a similar course for modern flap-’
pers to cure “poke neck,” and a few semi-
naries in Melbourne have the balancing act
m their curriculum. But what we really

what really good deportment is, and how
much it’s unlike some of our ugly habits,
such as the gait known as the St. Kilda
shrug.

“Cabailer”: “Thorold” (B. 4/l/’23) says
that Lloyd George let the Huns know* that
' auks were being made at 16 Midland fac-
L lies. If the Welshman did hint at the
Midlands he may have been more shrewd
than “Thorold” thinks, for the first and main
tank-building operations were carried out at
Burrell’s Engineering Works, East Dereham,
Norfolk. Any lack of success the first tanks
had was due to the awful weather conditions
when they were “sprung” on Fritz, and to
the inexperience inseparable from a new and
untried arm. But those who were in the
vicinity of the Maze at Flers and other
health-resorts a few weeks after found plenty
of proof that, whatever the Hun High Com-
mand knew, the infantry that held the front
line for Wilhelm savvied as much about
tanks as a beetle does about Sunday.

“Digger’s Batman”: The frosty rules of
the Repat. are not always blameworthy, even
when their incidence seems harsh. One regu-
lation provides that, when a war-widow re-
marries, her pension is continued for two
years only, although, of course, the pensions
of any children continue until they are 16.
It would have seemed harsher, but it might
have been kinder, if re-marriage had involved
forfeiture of pension. Quite a number of
war-widows have married men who only re-
main as long as the pension lasts, and then
disappear; one of these over-trustful women
was found—with her children—deserted and
starving the other day in Sydney. After all,
is there any reason why the Commonwealth,
in recognition of a soldier’s death on active
service, should subsidise any waster who
can induce the widow to marry him? It
would be far better if war-widows’ pensions
stopped immediately upon re-marriage, but
might be reinstated upon definite evidence of
desertion.

“Topee” : Casualness, whether in selecting
or dispensing with a mate, is by no means
the monopoly of the male Australian. The
other day a man was sentenced at the Parra-
matta Police Court for stealing a watch from
a lady. Evidence disclosed that the pair
were leaving a parsonage after making in-
quiries relating to their speedy union, when
the swain volunteered to take the lacky’s
watch for repair. While perfectly willing to
entrust herself into the gentleman’s hands,
for better or worse, Angelina drew the line
at handing over her ticker to her prospec-
tive spouse. Saddened at such want of con-
fidence, Edwin did a snatch and a duck; he
is now doing three months’ hard, and yet an-
-1 her romance has been blasted in the bud.
THE RANGER ON THE BEACH.
[FOR THE BILLETIN.]
At Aspendale (Vic.) a couple of summer police-
men order people off the beach should they attempt
to lie out to brown. Sylvia’s lover must stand by
powerless while a young- fellow in uniform minutely
examines the legs and other attractions that Sylvia
necessarily exhibits when she desires to bathe, to
decide if they are strictly decorous.”
Halt! attention! gentle stranger,
I’m the Corporation ranger,
Scouting up and down the beaches,
Putting acid on the peaches.
When I peep in the enclosure,
Lord ! the terrible exposure!
Matrons showing bosoms bare
1 admonish with a stare:
Now then, gentle dame, no larks,
Powder up your garter-marks ;
Don’t you understand it’s shocking
To confess you’ve worn a stocking?
Pull your “what’s its” round your knees,
Shameless damsel, if you please;
There’s your “thingums” falling out!
Hey, there! Look what you’re about,
Lord! if they don’t get me going,
With the “person” they keep showing!
There’s another; snare her quickly;
Pile some bags upon her thickly!
What can one poor ranger do?
Hurry ! Fetch the dog-lasso
Ere she to the thick scrub rushes
To conceal her shameless blushes!
Damsels in the breezes swaying
And forbidden charms displaying,
When they see me coming, quiver
Like the willows by a river!
And, although I never “nick” them,
How their consciences must prick them,
After prayers, before they slumber,
When they reckon up the number
Of impressionable flappers
Ruined by those clinging wrappers!
Do they never stop and cry :
“There, but for his frown, go I” ?
Do they never pause and brood
On the laws of rectitude?
Deem they my attentions hateful?
Some day, some day, they’ll be grateful
For the wondrous good I’ve done them
When from off the sand I’ve run them.
Firmly screw them when they’re browning,
. Firmly screw them, deeply frowning ;
Should they linger in the shallows
Seize them ! Rush them to the gallows !
There’s no option, they must get
Fully clothed or dripping wet!
VICTORIA.

Tn George-street north the sailors go
Along the pavement, row on row ;
With open neck and out-thrown chest
The plenteous tavern bars they breast
The froth off pots galore to blow.
Their pants are tight at waist, and so
No longer is it comm.e il faitt
To hitch them up with old-time zest
In George-street north.
But still at foot they flap and flow
Like loosened mainsails —apropos
Garbed like my childhood’s tars were drest,
They bring me back old memories blest
Of Plymouth and of Westward Ho
In George-street north.

ROSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The beauty, dimpled, bright, serene,
Disdaining artful aid,
Which marks a true-born Nature’s Queen
Above the homely maid;
Which charms the multitude awhile
And drives warm suitors mad,
Moves me not now to scowl or smile —
It merely makes me sad.
With drab forebodings this fair rose,
Whose tints the dawn did match,
Who gracefully her fragrance throws
For gentle breeze to catch,
Oppresses me to-day, despite
The sunshine gay and glad;
Young folk may view it with delight—
My grizzled mood is sad.
The pathos of life’s perfumed spring
Englooms a jaded heart;
Youth is as birds upon the wing
That from one’s sight depart;
Since maidens lose, as roses lose,
The freshness erst they had,
What maid shall chide me if I choose
To sing that I am sad ?
Let happy youth, extolling youth,
Laud loud the lark on high,
Whilst Time, the seeker after truth,
Sees generations die;
Smug optimists may hail the Light—
My creed, maybe, is bad,
But I have watched the swallows’ flight,
So Springtime makes me sad.
Oh, mock me not with jaunty sneer,
Oh, mock me not in glee,
Lest surely, in some future year,
My ghost-laugh startles thee!
The soaring lark at early dawn
Sings to each lass and lad ;
I sigh where last year’s leaves lie strawn,
And all my soul is sad.
Unfaded Rose, whose beauty sweet
In ballroom or on beach,
On countryside, or sordid street,
The joy of life must preach,
Methinks I see you fat or lean,
Your bosom built of pad—
I picture the dethroned Queen,
A wreck of what she once has been,
And therefore am I sad.
VICTORIA.

“Lucius” : Next to getting the whole three
seats in the Senate, Vic. Laborites’ sweetest
plum at the elections was the knock-out of
Bill Plain. The big Scot was one of the
special pets of the Trades Hall when in the
Leg. Assembly, and they handed him the
job of Minister for Lands in the short-lived
Elmslie Cabinet;
but he followed
Hughes out of the
Bowyang party
when the conscrip-
tion split came.
And, like all good
proselytes. Plain
thereafter be-
labored his former
comrades unmerci-
fully. Now he
goes back to stook-
ing his hay on his
farm at Lara a
sadder but a richer
man, while the
L abo rites are
chanting a “Te
Deum.” At one
Trades Hall a big
concourse rose and
cheered lustily
when it was seen
that Plain was
groping about at
the foot of the
ladder.
Vic.'s resurrected
Labor Senator,
TED FINDLEY.
The representative of a small Melbourne
paper once waited on Hughes to check some
trifling detail about his mottled career. Billy
didn’t know —couldn’t remember. Quite pos-
sibly the story was true. “I’ll tell you
what,” said William, “I can’t swear to it,
but I’ll look up ‘Who’s Who in Australia’
and let you know.” Another time a young
St. Kilda matron, a modeller in ciay, wanted
to get a study of Billy. “You want to do
me in mud,” said he. “But the papers are
doing that every day!”
Drowned in a boating accident on the
Arthur River (Tas.), J. L. Glasson, M.A.,
D.Sc., one of Australia’s keenest young scien-
tists. He had associations with the ’varsities of
Adelaide, Tasmania, Cambridge and Mel-
bourne ; in all of them he did brilliant work,
and as research chemist to the Electrolytic
Zinc and Carbide cos. in Tas. he discovered
processes of the greatest value. He was
brother-in-law of Solomon, late Premier of
the Speck, another brilliant ’varsity ■ man.
Glasson was 34, Solomon 36.
“Lexite”: When Boss told the N.S.W.
Cement Commission that “Mr. John Storey
said on one occasion, "A cove wants to give
me £lO,OOO if I can get him 5000 tons of
cement,” he was probably mistaken. Storey
was more likely to have said “a bloke.”
Everybody was a bloke to him, and he stag-
gered a haughty commercial magnate who
called as a deputation one day by saying “a
bloke like you.” The magnate, also an ardent
loyalist, may have been mollified since to
know that the Prince shared the title.
The Federal Parliament becomes more and
more a refuge for persons who have fallen
by the wayside, as it were, in State politics.
There are three such in W.A.’s present con-
tribution to the place at the top of Bourke-
street- —Harry Gregory. Walter Kingsmill
and A. E. Green. The last only appeared on
the political horizon about a dozen years
ago, but Gregory and Kingsmill sat together
as Ministerial colleagues in the first Groper-
land Administration formed after Bigjohn
Forrest laid down his State sceptre in 1901.
There is only one other survivor of that
A HOPELESS TASK.
“Mr. Bruce, the new Prime Minister-elect, is tall,
slim and extremely good-looking.”
DEPUTATION FROM THE CARTOONISTS’
UNION : “ Can’t you grow a ziff or wear
kilts or do something to save us all
from getting the sack?”
Cabinet, and he, too, is still a legislator of
sorts —Joe Holmes, State M.L.C.
William A. Cadbury, one of the cocoa
directors, is on the Narkunda, due at the
end of this month. He intends visiting
Clai’emont (Tas.), where his firm, in con-
junction with the Frys and Pascalls, has
established large works. William A. is the
second son of Richard Cadbury, who with
the late George Cadbury in 1879 transferred
the firm’s headquarters from Birmingham
to Bournville, where the famous garden vil-
lage has developed into a city of more than
1000 houses, with schools, halls, churches
and other buildings. William Cadbury, who
was for two years Lord Mayor of Birming-
ham, will be in Australia for about three
months, and intends returning to England
via the Panama Canal. His wife and a
daughter are with him.
South Aus. railways have broken their
remarkable run of freedom from accident
fatal to a passenger. On Foundation Day
(Jan. 29) a heavy train, leaving Adelaide
station for sports at Kapunda, met a light
suburban one coming in. The latter had no
chance. Along with the fireman on the
lighter engine, H. J. Brailey, a veteran who
was within a year of completing a half-
century in the accountant’s department of
Adelaide Register, lost his life.
David Charles Hamilton Florence, who,
on the tip of Ernest Rutherford, gets the Chair
of Physics at Victoria University College
(M.L.), is the one Maorilander of the 13
apnlicants. Florence his M.A. degree
with first-class honors in electricity and mag-
netism in 1907. and in the following year
was trailing M.Sc. astern his name for work
in geology and chemistry. After a couple
al wears-as. demonstrator in physics at Can-
terbury (*M.L.) College, he went to the Vic-
toria University, Manchester, and assisted
the brilliant Prof. Rutherford in radium
research. He was lecturer and demonstra-
tor in Physics there until the war, in which
he saw service in Egypt and Mesopotamia.
Then he became Professor of Physics at the
llong-Kong ’Varsity, and from that job
brings home enough knowledge of Chinese
to enable him to cope with the saffron
gentleman who will sell him lettuce in his
native land.
Little W. H. Ifould, N.S.W. Public Libra-
rian, who is off round the world, was in his
youth a first-class amateur rider. Turning
from prads to plants later on, he became
about the best all-in amateur gardener in
Australia, and his weekly column was one
of the things that propped up Sydney Sun-
day News in its chancy infancy. He is also
a nearly-fueat librarian. Under him the
Sydney Public and Mitchell Libraries have
been systematised to ball-bearing smooth-
ness, and are principally staffed by women.
One of the things Ifould claims to have
learned is that girls and old girls are better
adapted to library work than johnnies and
oid johnnies.
“Alastor”: Judge Noel, just dead, enjoyed
a joke in court even at his own expense. In
the old roaring days of Western Queensland,
Noel was about to sentence a man for some-
thing or other, and asked if the prisoner
could adduce any extenuating circumstance.
“Yes, your Honor,” said the prisoner. “I
happened to take too much overproof rum
out of what the barmaid told me was the
judge’s bottle.” "Ah,” his Honor replied—
“something, I think, I may have recommended
for snakebite.” The sentence that followed
was a very light one, anyway.
Dr. F. W. Richards, K.C., Crown Solici-
tor of Adelaide, was one of the first of
S.A.’s quartette of Doctors of
Law. He is a shy little man,
and, unlike so many other sons
of the manse, his hobby is Sun-
day-school teaching—every Sab-
bath afternoon he pushes an
ancient bike from Unley to
Franklin-street Method.v School.
Before taking his present job
Richards was associate to the
late C.J. Way, and he drafted
bills for Parliament from 1908
till 1916. Incidentally, he is
off on a trip to England in
April with his wife and brace
of daughters.
Electors in the Speck who
for years have found food for
ridicule in the position on the
poll of one persistent candidate
are denied that cruel pleasure
in the future. Mrs. O’Shea
Petersen is now communing
with the angels, having passed
out. after a prolonged illness,
at 61. Twice married, she was
an ardent worker in feminist
and social movements, and often
tried (alwavs without success)
to get into the State Parliament.
“Uramao” : Chris Watson, sometime Prime
Minister of the Commonwealth, has been visit-
ing the home of his boyhood. He dropped into
the Mail office, Oamaru (M.L.), where he
served his apprenticeship. Two men are
still there who snatched type with him in
the ’eighties, and they gave him a glad
welcome.
“Pedro” : Reference to Simon Hickey, ex-
N. S. Wales M.L.A. (B. l/2/’23), jogs my
memory. Wasn’t it Simon who, in adversely
discussing Holman’s retreat from Labor in
the Assembly, deplored the escapee’s ami-
ability and unwillingness to say “No,” then
thoughtfully added, “Indeed, when I think
of the Premier’s susceptibility in this respect
I shudder to think what might have happened
to the hon. member if he had been born a
female !”?
Major Cooke-Russell, who gets the job of
Lecturer in Physical Training at the
N.S.W. Teachers’ College, was selected by
Kitchener in 1904 to be superintendent of
“■ierks” in the Egyptian Army, and when
the Commonwealth Physical Training Staff
was formed in 1911 he was placed second
in command. He had seen service in
S’Africa, the Soudan and elsewhere before
making the re-acquaintance of Stoush in the
Big War. Commonwealth retrenchment
pushed him out of his Defence job recently.
Bill Tregurtha, one of the men who
onened the New Chum gold-mine at Lefroy
(Tas.), mounted the golden stair recently,
aged 80. The mine paid good divs. for a
while, and Bill was a near-millionaire —on
paper. But a faulted reef or something hit
the show, and he had to go to work again.
He became a member of the Launceston
Stock Exchange in 1890, and was made a
life member a few weeks back in recogni-
Pon of his great services to the mining in-
dustry. His brother Charlie, who survives
him, was also connected with the New Chum
in its infancy.
Now that N.S.W. Chief Public Librarian
Ifould has gone jaunting to Europe, Mitchell-
librarian Hugh Wright becomes Acting-
Chief for a space. Wright narrowly escaped
getting the better-paid job when F. M.
Bladen gave up ; but Fred Watson, now of
the Historical Records in Melbourne, upset
the pot. Watson, however, was presently
turned down because he had no library ex-
perience ; and Ifould, from Adelaide, caught
the chief’s post on the controversial re-
bound. Wright has done very well for the
Mitchell. As well as being an ardent student
and an experienced librarian he is a literary
and historical enthusiast, and the collection
under his prudent buying hands has greatly
increased its value since David Mitchell left
it.
A. E. CLARKSON, president of the Adel-
aide Chamber of Commerce, who has
just celebrated the 7 5th anniversary of
the birth of his paint-and-glass firm —
he claims it is the oldest of its hind in
the Commonwealth.
Joseph Bradley, who lives on the old
Elizabeth Farm property of John Macarthur,
claims to have on the grounds a four-roomed
building used as a schoolhouse by a' French-
man named Haon de Kenllian, who was
tutor to the Macarthur boys. The structure
dates from 1796, and is, therefore, the
oldest school building in Australia.
Three of the four S. Aus. Supreme Court
judges were born in the State. The excep-
tion is Justice Gordon, who opened his eyes
in Scotland. Justices Gordon, Poole and
Parsons are sons of the manse. Chief-
Justice George Murray’s dad was Alexander
Bortbwick Murray, an indefatigable Scot
who started sheep-farming at Mount Craw-
ford in 1839.
Robert Barr, chairman of Vic. Licenses
Reduction Board, is off at the end of March
on a trip to Canada, U.S A., England and
the Continent. He will get full pay, but
as compensation will pick up a bagful of
wrinkles about pubs. Australians ought to
get the solid truth from him regarding
prohibition in U.S.A., as he isn’t likely to
be swayed by prejudice. Barr threw up
politics after being in the Assembly for 21
hectic months in 1902-04.
“De Mortuis”: The doctors of National-
ism in N.S.W. are (or were) Owen Cox
and Pratten. They are alike in some things.
Both are intellectually long and physically
short, and both are “self-made men.” Cox
was a bank clerk in AVellington (M.L.) 30
years ago, and is now a shipping magnate
and one of the shrewdest. Pratten, with
his brother, began on a little side-street busi-
ness, and is now a more or less retired poten-
tate in jam and tin. Ilis medicine is con-
sidered less potent since, in the elec-
tion campaign, he drew a line between
Hughes’s policy and the National party.
Hovering over these is J. C. Watson, and
behind them is always the astute Parkhill.
Some time ago they made Carruthers (an-
other big-little man) campaign-director.
Combustion naturally ensued. Two big-
little men might get on ; but not three. It
was a fore-damned trinity, and Joe Car-
ruthers jumped out.
A virile veteran of Australian music is
Henry J. King, who composed the cantata
sung at the ooening of Melbourne Exhibition
nearly 40 years ago, and conducted the orches-
tra through it. He has been living in Brisbane
for years, and was recently lecturing there
on grand opera with the aid of a gramo-
phone. King was born a high-speed talker,
and as a lecturer on his own subjects can
hold a crowd.
“B. Wildered”: I want to know some-
thing more of my Battery mate Sawdust.
Three days after joining us a piece of whiz-
bang broke one of his arms. The hospital
train left in an air raid, and bumped into a
French train. Sawdust, falling from an
upper berth, broke the other arm. The hos-
pital ship he was in was torpedoed crossing
the Channel and sank. Sawdust reached
Dover in a destroyer. Two weeks later Fritz
found him in one of the London hosp ; tals
and bombed him. At Weymouth the Medical
Board handed him six months’ Aussie leave,
plus four days’ special. And then, appa-
rently, something else happened to him, for
instead of being sent (o Aussie he was passed
on to Bulford. You know what that was.

NURSE EUEPHANT : “My dear, you never saw
such a tiny baby in your life. I’m sure
it was not an ounce over half-a-ton.”
“S.S.”: Reverting to women swaggies.
The Bulloo (Q.) track was the favorite beat of Mi’s.
Higgins, widow of a man who made money in the
very early days of Gympie and then lost it. She
had many a good job on stations, but got the
wanderlust. She speculated in land in Bundaberg
about 30 years ago and did well, but it didn’t cure
her of her love of roaming, for she kept on the
road. She never cadged or borrowed, and she
carried a revolver, using it more than once against
those presuming on her unprotectedness. The last
I heard of her, some years ago, she was drawing
rents from a row of houses in Rockhampton. Then
there was Lizzie Bowen, an all-round axe-woman,
who made a good thing fencing and timber-getting
with her father and brothers. When she was about
to marry she bought a bit of land and 200 heifers,
and split the stuff and got in the blocks for her future
home. Something went wrong on her wedding day ;
whereupon she slung all her work and took the track
with the idea of finding and settling the man who
had deserted her. I don’t know if she ever found
him. I hope she did. She was one of the finest,
warmest-hearted women you’d meet in a day’s tramp.

“Birre Gurra”: Some time ago Abo. ex-
perts were enthusistically swapping yarns re slick
cow-spaying efforts. My entry hardly comes under
the heading of slick, but here it is. A few weeks
ago, on a small selection in Queensland, a vet.
was procured from some distance away to spay 28
young cows. Working swiftly and scientifically, he
killed 27 of ’em. Record?
“Bad Australian”: “Pro” (B. 4/l/’23)
asks if wombat burrows inter-communicate, warren-
fashion. The ’bat is a morose, solitary cuss, except
in the mating season; but he is occasionally found
in small communities in places where the sinking
is good and the sappy fern-root abounds. In these
circumstances, one cross-cut sometimes breaks into
a neighbor’s workings—whether by design or acci-
dent it is difficult to say. Some years ago I ran
a fox into an abandoned wombat-burrow on the
side of Mt. Lindsay (Vic.), and when I lit a
fire at the mouth of the burrow the smoke issued
at two points, where small circular shafts had
been sunk perpendicular to and connecting with the
burrow. These shafts were about 7ft. deep,and 2ft.
in diameter —much too small for a binghi to operate
in, even if he had the energy and the necessary
tools to sink such a hole. So the question arises:
Were the holes made by Brer ’Bat, and, if so,
how, and whaffor ?
* * * *
“Yeltuor”: In carrying out a gas attack
on Bunny recently, I got a deuce of a surprise—
two of them, in fact. Having read about a machine
for pumping smoke from smouldering cocky-ehaff into
the warrens, I built one myself. The cylinder was
2ft. high and sin. in diameter, made of a 24-gauge
galvanised sheet. 1 had used it a few times, and
was getting good results, the only trouble being
from a tarry deposit in the cylinder, which inter-
fered somewhat with the leather plunger. Then
one day I had just about finished a warren, and
was jambing the handle up and down at a great
rate, when the smoky mixture under the plunger
exploded. The handle was snatched from my two-
handed grip, and, with rod and plunger attached,
went straight up. The top of the cylinder was a
disc of wood, fixed by four screws through the
metal, and these screws were torn through by the
force of the explosion. The material that upset
the show was simply cocky-chaff and broken-up
straw from a shed floor. Next time I used clean
ha}' chaff, and, having cleaned the cylinder, was
pumping as before, when a similar explosion
occurred. After that I was a bit nervous, so I
gave up burning chaff and tried sulphur, spreading
it on rag, then rolling it up into a tight “wad” or
cartridge. Three or four of these “wads” smoulder-
ing make a terrific volume of fumes, and there’s no
danger of their going off with a bang. After a few
rounds with the sulphur mixture every warren
remained closed up, and now not a rabbit is to be
seen. (There had been only a few of the old hard-
heads left after a poisoning campaign.) But, see-
ing the force to be generated from the cocky-chaff,
I’ve come to the conclusion that a Tin Lizzie
could be poked along by a bundle of straw, and,
when my nerves get properly right, I’m going to
give it a fly.
“Lofty”: “No,” grunted old Bill, as he
turned a batch of charcoal tarts on the ashes, “you
can’t git a decent lad these days. ’Ere’s me sent
me offsider out after the rain to git the team
together. ’E’s away a fortnit and ’e gets ’ome
with erbout enough of me mob to make a stoo.”
* * * *
“Girofla”: “Jimmy Trousers” reminds me
(B. 14/12/’22) that Queensland possesses what we
called “the soap-tree.” It is not unlike the silver-
gum, having long tapering leaves and rough bark.
The flowers are an excellent substitute for soap,
giving a beautiful lather when rubbed up with
water. These flowers are inconspicuous on the tree,
and consist merely of clusters of tough green and
dried petals. The lather produced is very similar
to that obtained when the well-known - panama-bark
(Quillaiae cortex ) is rubbed with water. I don’t
know whether “Jimmy Trousers” can find the tree
in his district, but it’s well worth looking for.
* * * *
“Widgee”: Horses seem to have a sense
of danger unknown to human beings—or is it
merely uncannily acute hearing? In my district,
a farmer, while out riding with his daughter,
dismounted to tighten his girth, and as he was
doing so the horse gave a sudden, frantic bound. A
branch fell from overhead . and killed the man.
The daughter, who was facing the tree, noticed no
danger until the branch was well on its way earth-
wards, while the nag had stood tail to the trunk,
and so could have seen nothing. Bush records
show that a horse seldom gets caught in a crash
of the kind, unless yarded or tied up.
* * * *
“Eddyson” : When the hut occupied by
Tripper, the official searcher at the Hip Hurrah gold-
mine, at Yam, was blown sky high, several varying
conclusions were come to. Tripper, like all
searchers, was detested by the men, and possibly
some faceman as a delicate jest had discharged a
plug of dynamite under his bunk, or perhaps Tripper
had been stealing dynamite from the Hurrah stores
to retail to the small mining parties working the
leaders at Pitt Hill, and his accumulation had gone
off by accident. At any rate, it was definitely decided
that Trip, had gone to glory by the direct route,
although the Coroner insisted the material held for
Christian burial was portion of an uncooked shoulder
of mutton, and not human remains in the stricter
sense. Three Cousin Jacks, good Wesleyans, buried
the fragments with the benefit of a lay-reader,
determined to give Trip, a fighting chance even if he
was a searcher. Imagine Brother Best’s amazement
when, on arriving in Melbourne a fortnight later,
he ran into Tripper on the Spencer-street station.
Both were disconcerted, but Best was first to speak.
“Glory be,” he gasped, “is’t passeeble it’s blown ’ee
all this fur and thee’s still livin’?”
* * * *
“F. Seedy” : The manager of Gurley sta-
tion, in the Moree (N.S.W.) district, vouches for
this. A tank-sinker had gone down 4ft. in exca-
vating a tank on the run, when he came in to
announce, that he was slinging in the job as there
were “too many blanky snakes in the ground.” The
manager was doubtful, but, knowing the tank-sinker
was not seeing things, went and had a look for
himself. He found scores of dead snakes, and the
result of one specimen furrow, ploughed while he
was there, satisfied him too that the crawlers were
in hundreds —all breeds and sizes. Admitting
THE MAN IN POSSESSION.
ANGRY MOTORISR (to sullcy-driver who has failed: to pull off ) : “I'll- I'll-buy you a
blanky road of your own.”
TACKY : “Buy one for your plurry self —I got one.”
that they could get down by the cracks in the
ground (it is in blacksoil country), is this particular
spot just a breeding-ground, or would the whole
run be so infested?
\ * * *
“Yarrum”: Once saw three coal-miners —
two of them a greasy-heeled
horse at Helensburgh (N.S.W.). They put 14 shots
in his head, but not one in the right spot, or within
inches of it. After a bit, a returned soldier who had
outed scores of neddies in Palestine came along, and
one shot did the trick. For the benefit of horse-
killers the spot is just under the tuft of hair on
the forehead.
* * * *
“Bush Girl”: On a recent walking trip
we came upon an ancient tramp camped beside a
very doubtful-looking mudhole. When we ques-
tioned him about the water he assured us that his
billy tea was quite all right. “I strains it through
me towel, and then I strains it through me teeth —
and then it’s 0.K.,” he explained.
* * * *
“Centre”: I lost a quid to a butcher
the other day, and saw something new. I’d ordered
a couple of pounds of rump, and noticed the way
he sliced off the portion with one clean cut; also
the fact that the meat weighed the two pounds to a
hair. On my remark that he couldn’t go as near
as that a second time he repeated the performance.
I then offered to bet him a quid he couldn’t do it
blindfolded. He took me up. His assistant bandaged
nis eyes, and 1 called for two-and-a-half pounds,
thinking the extra eight ounces might get him
tangled. One clean cut again, and when the severed
portion was slung on to the scales I handed over
the note. He’d cut it to the exact weight. I’ve
seen weights guessed near up many a time, but
never quite as near as this.
THE WRONG WEAPON OF DEFENCE.
THE SECOND : “And next time I tell you to
block his left, use your glove—not your
face!”
'“Moon E.” : The mixed-team prize should
have gone to the late Dick Maurice, a well-known
Centralian bushraan. At the first race meeting at
Tarcoola (S.A.), in 190 T, he provided the convey-
ance .to transfer the secretary from his tent office to
the course, and the team he hitched to an ancient
buckboard consisted of a mule, a horse, a camel and a
donkey. Having escaped many potholes en route
disaster came as he was driving up the straight
and the whole box-and-dice turned turtle. But when
the mess was sorted out the total destruction
amounted merely to a broken strap or two and one
bottle of whisky.
“Girofla”: Tell “X2X” (B. 18/l/’23)
that there are two species of Strychnos indigenous to
Australia, 8. psilosperma and S. lucida. Chemically,
(hey are both closely related to the official pharma-
copaiial S. nux vomica (indigenous to the East
Indies), as they contain strychnine and brucine. Like
S. nux vomica they are intensely bitter, especially
8. psilosperma. The percentage of strychnine is con-
siderably in excess of the brucine. With regard to
pharmacological properties, however, Dr. L. Ban-
croft, of Bananaland, found that the frog Hyla
caerulea could not be poisoned with S. psilosperma,
while the same frog is. very susceptible to S. nux
vomica, characteristic tetanic convulsions being
readily produced by . small doses of the latter.
Strychnos, by the way, belongs to the natural order
Logana'ceae. Many species of the Solanaceae are in-
digenous here. The fairly common trumpet-lily
contains a high percentage of alkaloids allied with
atropine, the active principle of belladonna. The
bulbs of many lilies in N. Queensland are intensely
poisonous. Such belong to the Solanaceae and con-
tain an extraordinarily high percentage of alkaloids.
A child who rubbed his tongue across the cut surface
of one of these bulbs was laid up for three weeks.
Milk, by the way, is found to be an excellent anti-
dote. Incidentally, a new alkaloid was isolated from
a species of Solanaceae at the Sydney Medical School.
It is known as solandine.
“Mary S.” : My Malaprop entry was per-
petrated by George, a hefty young bachelor-selector
out Western Queensland way. George came to town
one Saturday afternoon to find all the youthful
femininity departed to Cunnamulla, whither the
Bishop had gone to receive them into the bosom of
the church. Having perforce to content himself
with the society of the mothers of the absent fair,
George ventured politely: “So you did not go to
Cunnamulla with the girls to be confined, Mrs.. M. ?”
To which the astounded lady (the mother of 12)
replied aptly enough: “No, George, I’ve had my day.”

“W.D.G.”: If “Jimmy Trousers” (B.
14/12/’22) doesn’t find any of the other Abo. sub-
stitutes for soap satisfactory, let him try a little
common flour. It will remove all blemishes and
make his complexion a hot favorite in any beauty
competition.
* * * *
“C.F.S.”: A little personal experience
bearing on the drink-and-weight argument. I’ve
never weighed a piggy, but I did weigh our baby.
She is breast-fed, and, after three hours’ sleep, she
went just a shade over 201 b. I then let her have
her tucker, which occupied 15 minutes. Immedi-
ately I put her on the scales again, and I could have
fallen flat when I found she was barely 201 b
lighter than before she had had her blow-out. This
little episode is a comical commentary on the prac-
tice quoted by “X.R.M.0.” (B. 30/11/’22) of weigh-
ing a baby to find out how much he eats. I’ve long
known and smiled at the old yarn about an animal
weighing more before than after a meal, but now my
smile has got a bit crooked.

“Ack F. C.”: In addition to the bread-
fruit’s propagation by suckers, as explained by
“Prof.” (B. 18/l/’23), many species self-layer the
lower branches. Later the young trees seem to rot
off the link of parental control, and, later still, send
youngsters of their own into the world.
“Ned Kelly”: Can any Abo. tell me why
all bush birds take notice of the soldier-bird’s alarm-
call, and practically disregard all others? As soon
as a soldier sounds the alarm every bird within
AN EYEFUL.
“Why are you staring at me?”
“ Please, sir, there’s nowhere else to look!”
hearing gets out of danger; but if a magpie, for
instance, gives the danger call, only magpies take
any notice of it. This is all the more remarkable
because the soldier-bird is responsible for twice as
many false alarms as any other.
* * * *
“S. Ringer” : A few weeks ago I was drov-
ing with a thousand head of bullocks in North
Queensland. Going out to take first watch I met
my two mates, Bill and Joe, coming in to camp,
and stopped to light a cigarette. The others did
the same, all three of us using the same match.
When Joe reached the camp, he picked up a log to
put on the fire. A red-backed spider ran out and
bit him on the arm. My turn came next. When my
watch was nearly up something started the bullocks
off. I sent my horse after them as hard as I could,
ran into a tree, was laid out for three hours, and
broke my horse’s leg. Meanwhile, Bill had caught
the other night-hoTse, and was half-way across when
his mount came down in the soft mud, leaving him
to stagger back to camp with a broken collar-bone.
We had to leave three bullocks with broken legs,
and six more are still lost in the scrub. Anyone
who wants a light from me in future gets an
unstruck match.
* * * *
“Aclc F. C.”: I dips n■’ ’id to “Key-
string” (B. 18/l/’23), who modest.„ states he has
slain 5000 kangaroos in four yea s. Allowing 65
days off per year for Sabbaths, etc., and not for-
getting cartage of the pelts, “Keystone” laid low
four ’roos a day for four years! Doesn’t he want
someone to take command of his Army Service trans-
ports before he begins the next offensive?
• * * *
“Allbutt”: “Pick” (B. 18/l/’23) reminds
me of an unfortunate animal who wasn’t so lucky
as his prad Gohanna. A few years ago a chap
tethered his nag in a portion of the Pillaga scrub,
out Narrabri way (N.S.W.), and, strolling off, got
lost. He wandered home after the seeohd day, but
a search could not locate the horse, and it was
decided that he had strayed. A couple of months
later the remains Were found at the foot of the
tree practically buried in a hole made by the
animal in his attempt to free himself. And if he
had had sufficient nous he could have freed himself
by a sharp jerk of his head.
* * # *
“O.O.”: I can give another instance of
albatrosses attacking a man in the water (B.
18/l/’23). A passenger fell overboard from the
s.s. Canberra, and when his body was picked up 40
minutes later the eyes were missing, ears nearly gone
and the face badly mauled.
* * * *
“Ragar”: “Jim Carew’s” par (B.
18/l/’23) about the two tame kookaburras who
waited for the opening of a case containing bad
meat, is the Q.E.D. to my assertion that
Jack has a very poor sense of smell. The
kookaburra is not a carrion-eater, and will
reject tainted meat. As tame birds these two
may be in the habit of getting scraps of fresh
meat when it arrives from Sydney, but meat that
has been astray for three days is not fresh, and
had those two Jacks anything but the very poorest
sense of smell they wouldn’t have sat cackling on
ton of it for two solid hours.
“Colub”: Re “F.II.R.’s” suggestion that
a child came to no harm when bitten by a black
snake with which it was playing because the
wriggler merely gave the youngster an innocuous
admonitory bite (B.
18/l/’23). A venomous
snake never tries to
poison its victim unless
it has become angered or
frightened, the possession
of fangs and venom
glands being primarily for
defensive purposes. Un-
til there is the simula-
tion of anger or fear, it
does not raise its fangs
(which normally lie flat),
so that they will not in-
terfere with eating. When
the snake strikes, the
whole thing depends on
the angle at which the
points of the fangs touch
the flesh of the proposed
victim. The greater
this angle the greater the
chances of their entering
the flesh, the risk being
at a maximum when the
angle is about 90 degrees.
But it is possible that
they may touch at a very
small angle, that is, near-
ly parallel with the flesh,
so that there is a chance
of their gliding over it in-
stead of penetrating it;
and this probably is what
happened in the case men-
tioned by “F.H.R.” The
force with which a snake
strikes depends on the
length of its body, coiled
and on the ground.
Generally, the wriggler
must have two-thirds of
its body coiled to enable
it to strike its hardest,
so that probably the in-
stance in question was a
happy combination of the
reptile not being properly
balanced and tire fang-s
making contact with the
child’s flesh at a low
angle. It could hardly have been anything else,
seeing that a child's skin is so tender that it
requires very little force to make the needle-points
enter.

“Dr. Nil”: Put this in your Coincidence
Competition. In a report of a S. Aus. drowning
fatality the names of the holiday party concerned
are given as follow: J. C. Crawford (drowned),
A. V. Cave, V. V. Crase, A. V. Crase, H. W.
Cowley—all staying at Aldinga, and all well-known
business men. All their names commence with C;
three of them commence with “Cra.” The Christian
names of three of them contain the letter v; in
two cases the initials are “A.V.C.”
* * * *
“Machete”: Tell “Wanderer” (B.
18/l/’23) that the laughing jackass is a burglar of
other birds’ nests and a devourer of the fledglings.
Years ago, in Brisbane, my window looked out on a
wilderness of galvanised-iron roofing, where sparrows
by the hundred built in the spouting, and quite often
.Tacks came along, “hawked” out the untidy nests
and gobbled up the young sparrows. That was
within 50 feet of Queen-street, too.
“F.A.”: “Girofla” (B. 11/l/’23 1 on
poisonous trees re-
minds me that in tne
1902 drought a shrub
that used to tempt the
hungry jumbuck was a
stunted-bush called, in
the district between
the Murrumbidgee and
Lachlan, apple-bush. It
was well endowed with
foliage, and was a
boon to scrub-cutters,
as they didn’t have to
climb. But its value
as a fodder fizzled out
when one morning 72
sheep were found dead
within as many yards
of the clump of apple-
bush on which they
had fed overnight. No
such result attended the
feeding of sheep on
similar scrub on other
parts of the run. The
manager of the station
had the trees killed,
and the scrub-cuttere
had to return to the
former occupation of
shinning aloft for
edible foliage.
“Harry Hardtimes”: Will some Abo.
oblige me with the name of a bird I have seen
between the Normanby and Jennie rivers (Q.)?
It lives mostly on the lagoons and swamps, and is
as large, if not larger, than a native-companion.
It has a white breast and white underneath the
wings, but the rest is black. A huge bill and very
long legs complete the description. It is a very
shy bird, and I’ve never seen two of them together.
“W.D-.G.”: “Wilfrido” (B. 4/l/’23) isn’t
far out when he places the horse alongside the
camel tor hanging on without water. Some years
ago, on a Western N.S.W. station, the dogger
was picked up after being dead nine or ten days,
and a few days later his pack-horse was found tied
up to a tree and still alive. This happened during
the hot weather, and that old prad went on living
for four or five years.
» * * »
“Perdix”: “Cellu Lloyd” (B. 28/12/’22)
moves me to remark that there are some Aus-
tralians who have discovered that there is an upside-
down way of putting in poles and such-like. Some
cookies, when splitting, always chip from each
post a corner at the end nearer to the head of
the tree to ensure this end’s going into the ground.
Such posts keep their ends up about three years
longer than their brothers that wear their butt-ends
under the sod.
* # * *
A killing controversy :
“Centurion”: Tell “Bullet” (B. 18/l/’23) that
the substitution of a pointed bullet for the ordinary
one used in his rifle will increase the range, and a
heavier charge of powder will add to the hitting
power; but in changing the standard ammunition
for stronger stuff “Bullet” is taking a serious risk.
It may be that, as he says, the barrel and bolt are
strong enough to stand the extra pressure, but a
man who has had the bolt of his rifle driven back
into his head by an over-powerful charge is a messy
and unpleasant spectacle.
“Nitro-Glycerin” : I don’t know much about pointed
bullets, but I have done some experimenting with
cartridges. I’ve filled scores with blasting gelatine.
After extracting the bullet from the ordinary .22
long cartridge (you can do it with bare fingers by
pulling sideways with a bending action) I emptied
out all the powder, and re-filled with blasting
gelatine, 75 per cent, nitro-glycerine, pushing it
well into the case with a round rod of wood, exert-
ing about 501 b. pressure. To replace the lead I
just interred it in the case with the fingers, then
placed the lead point of the bullet against the door-
post and pushed with the weight of the body. (The
strength of charge depends on the ramming, or,
rather, on the solidity of the finished cartridge, and
this varies greatly.) The ,22 cartridges treated thus
under test more than equalled .32 just powder-filled.
But anyone fooling round with these things can’t
make too sure about the rifle having plenty of
strength. I have two ,22’s disabled from these
experiments. My Winchester-repeater stood the best,
but the force of the explosion frequently burst the
cartridge case at the back. I often tied a handker-
chief around the outside to keep back the small
particles which used to hurt my eyes and forehead.
In any case the shell of the cartridge is so pressed
against the side of the barrel that it is difficult
to extract. My aforesaid repeater now has only one
side of the extractor—the other left in a hurry;
and I thought it was time to discard the old bolt-
action Winchester when the bolt escaped from its
moorings and gently tapped me on the chest.
“Ack P. C.”: Apart from the danger of the thing
the substitution of a heavier charge would not
necessarily increase either the muzzle velocity or
the hitting power of the bullet. The rifling has
been designed for carrying certain leads at certain
velocities, and any variation in charge would prob-
ably cause a forcing into the rifling and give an
erratic spin to the projectile. If “Bullet’s” gun
fails to drop his game at under 200 yards, let him,
if hunting for a crust, cut a hole or cross in
the nose of the lead. Such a dumming of the
bullet will cause sudden stoppage to most animals—
but, frankly, it’s a swine of a trick. If “Bullet”
hunts for fun. let him learn to drop his mark bv
a cleaner and better hit. Too many little animals
are to be found carting an old .22 cal. pellet some-
where around their hindquarters.
THE PARSON HAD THE ADVANTAGE.
FACETIOUS PARSON : “Ah, Jones, fools stand in slippery places .”
JONES : “Yes, sir, I see. But I'm blest if I can.”
“Theo D. Lite”: The velocity of a bullet depends
chiefly on the amount of powder behind it and the
more powder the greater the range. The increased
velocity gives better killing power in large game;
but on small game, where the bullet goes right
through in any case, it remains about the same. The
effect on the barrel will be to wear the rifling away
quicker and also to lead it up. As -to crimping
pliers, “Bullet” will have to make his own for
this size in howitzers.
THE BRIGHT GOLD BUGLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As light of foot and heart I strode
One morning towards the west,
I met Romance upon the road,
And he was quaintly drest.
A shining robe about him clung
Of fabric, wrought of old,
And from his swaying shoulders hung
A bugle of bright gold.
His hands were white, his brow unseamed,
His eyes were large and clear:
I said: “Good sir, I never dreamed
That I should meet you here.”
I said: “Though here, at times, regret
For vanished glory strays,
I thought that you were only met
On old historic ways.”
He said: “Not so, for there am I
Where those who seek me be;
I know no alien land or sky,
No road is strange to me.
“Wherever men have fared and fought,
And lived and loved and died,
And feared and hoped and dreamt and wrought,
There, night and noon, I stride.
“Alike to me are old and young:
Behold why I am here!”
His bright gold bugle he unslung,
And blew it, loud and clear.
And lo! as down that road, leaf-arched,
Its clarion notes rang out,
I saw a host of men that marched
With laugh and song and shout.
Long-dead and long-forgotten men,
Men bronzed and brave and bold,
They trod the Western road again
As once they trod of old.
Group after group they journeyed on
To dare and dream and toil —
Tall cattlemen with eyes that shone,
Brown tillers of the soil.
Whips cracked, wheels groaned and cattle lowed,
And as they onward drew,
Romance upon that Western road
His bright, gold bugle blew.
He blew; and far from city spires
And roofs, and walls that cramped,
I saw the smoke of bygone fires
AVhere bygone teamsters camped.
In wonder lost, “Romance,” I cried,
“Upsummoned from dead years,
What men are these?” Romance replied,
“They are the Pioneers.”
GRATITUDE.
THOMAS HENRY: “Well, thank you for the
shillin’; and remember, grandfather, if
you want Boy Scouts at your funeral
you’ve on’y goiter say the word!”
Then far and wide his bugle sped
Its magic notes again,
And at its sound I heard the tread
Of other eager men.
Old men and young, grim men and grey,
Men crafty, curious, bold—
They passed, and passing seemed to say:
“We are the slaves of gold!”
Bright birds flew by on jewelled wings,
Bright lights about them shone;
They neither heard nor saw these things,
But panted on and on.
They faded out, and lo! I heard
No bugle’s magic sound,
But just the singing of a bird
In love with all around.
Adown the road, now loud, now low,
No bugle charmed the air ;
Romance was gone, and yet I know
Romance still w'anders there.

‘Palmolive maintains that
superb skin health without
which beauty is impossible
Another year and still that schoolgirl compl
/f WOMAN may smile at the
P ass i n g °f the years when she
is conscious that her skin is
flower-fine, that it retains the bloom
and natural colouring of schoolgirl
days; but when the complexion
loses its smooth, elastic texture, its
fine transparent lustre, it signifies
the encroaching years more surely
than aught else. To retard the effeds
of time upon the fresh, clear skin
of youth, more than ordinary clean-
liness is required. The skin needs
treatment too —the kind of treat-
ment afforded by the use of natural
oils of the palm and the olive, for
these stimulate and soothe as well
as cleanse the skin.
Palmolive Soap contains these bene-
ficial oils, so gentle in their action,
so penetrative in their charader, that
they reach the minutest pores of
the skin, freeing them of all impuri-
ties, lending them new life and vigour.
Skin health and beauty are not
possible without complete and con-
stant cleanliness, the utter cleanli-
ness that comes with the daily use
of Palmolive—for Palmolive gets
beneath the surface.
Care of the complexion only begins
with the face. Your neck is just
as noticeable for beauty or for lack
of it. Arms and shoulders should
be kept firm and smooth. Use
Palmolive for bathing, and it will
do for your body what it does for
your face. Palmolive keeps the
skin smooth, soft and healthy and
adds greatly to comfort. The pro-
fuse, fragrant lather imparts a
delicious sense of exhilaration and
refreshment that lasts throughout
the most fatiguing Summer’s day.
Moments that count
Every moment you spend in treat-
ting your complexion with Palm-
olive is a moment that counts.
You will realise how greatly when
your mirror shows you the result
of a daily massage with the creamy
lather of Palmolive and pleasantly
warm water —you will delight in
the satin texture, the soft bloom
it leaves upon the face. Begin
this beauty treatment to-day !
SEKHET
The lioness - headed
deity, the wife of Ptah
the Self Created. Sek-
het symbolised fire and
sun heat, and was also
the terrible Goddess of
Plagues; as the "Eye
of Ra”she entered up-
on the task of destroy-
ing mankind.
To preserve their beauty,,
the elegant women of an-
cient Egypt, who counted
Sekhet amongst their
many goddesses, used the
oils of the palm and olive,
the same gentle stimulat-
ing cleansers we recom-
mend to you to-day.

The Rolls-Royce end of Sydney poured
into St. Mark’s at Darling Point one after-
noon last week to show its delight at the
rounding-off to Joan Tregarthen’s romance.
When Joan,. who is probably Sydney’s most
popular society girl, stepped up the aisle
in her shimmering satin frock with its Lim-
erick lace train, vellum-tinted with age, and
the choir-boys burst into “Hail to the
Bride!” a sigh of approval that was like
a suppressed cheer surged through the pews.
Padre Howard Lea, with orchestral sup-
port, made Hugh Main the happiest man in
the world; and bridesmaids Lorna Robin-
son, Susan Campbell and Mollie Main added
to the decorative effect in powder-blue silk
—they had wound chaplets of silver leaves
about their brows, thereby mooring misty
lengths of blue tulle veiling. A small page,
billed as Billie Bourke, warned trespassers
off the bride’s train, and Colonel Rutledge
was the A.S.C. to supply the golden gyve when
the padre suddenly and audibly demanded
something to go on with. The list of guests
bristled with Law and Medicine and A.J.C.
names and titles, for Joan is a grand-
daughter of old legal knight William Man-
ning, while Hugh is known as the owner of
more than one good racer —his colors are
blue and gold. The sandwich -of congratu-
lation was consumed at 52 Macleay-street,
and that’s about tantamount to murmuring
Claridge’s.
Lady Tryon, who was well known in Syd-
ney 40 years ago, has just died at the age
of S 9. Admiral Tryon left the Sydney sta-
tion to take charge of the Fleet in the
Mediterranean, where, in the summer of
1893, he was responsible for one of the
greatest peace-time disasters in the history
of the R.N. When 11.M.5. Victoria and
H.M.S. Camperdown collided during
manoeuvres, 22 officers (including the
Admiral) and over 300 men were drowned.
The tragedy was, incidentally, responsible for
one of the few authenticated examples of
second sight. Lady Tryon was at a party at
Devonshire House, in London, when the col-
lision occurred, and suddenly left, telling
her hostess that she was too upset to stay,
having seen her husband “sinking amid a
mass of wreckage.” A few hours later she
learned of his death.
The announcement of the marriage of Joan
Dxckson-Poynder, only daughter of Lord
Islington, to Sir Edward Grigg, a former
“Colonial” editor of the Times, who accom-
panied Edward of Wales to Australia on
the Renown and has since been Military
Secretary to H.R.H., will remind Maori-
landers of the good-looking mother and
charming father who were once their vice-
regals. Joan was only a small girl when the
Islingtons arrived in Wellington with a
circle of domestic animals that included a
net cow. The Islington lady had been in
England’s Smart Set, and the antediluvian
millinery of the antipodean Very Best, com-
bined with the unco’ guidness of the expres-
sions beneath, seemed to excite her Ex.’s
sense of humor —nften at the wrong moment.
S'e had a habit, too, of scribbling little
u tes in the middle of a reception and send-
them along to some member of the Gov-
ernment House party. Whatever they con-
rained generallv caused a sudden grin <>n the
face of the reader. Yet she was the ideal host-
ess to simple, kindly bodies who found them-
selves caught in the wide-flung net of v;ce-
regal entertainments. Joan has inherited
her mother’s wide-eyed, rippling-haired
beauty.
The present Viee-Reine, Lady Jellicoe,
entertains splendidly, has a simple, down-
right manner, and adores children. Generous
in the matter of present-giving, she yet de-
lights in a bargain; “14s. 6d. for a’child’s
skipping-rope !’’ she said in scandalised tones
to one Dominion mother". “Why. I know
where we can get them for 12s. 6d.” And so
she did !
News has reached Queensland from the
Governor of Polish Wolhynia of the murder,
during a Bolshevik pleasant Sunday after-
noon, of the Dowager Comtesse de Tour-
nouer at Kieff, whither she had fled when
the Boclie approached her P'olish home. In
spite of her 82 years, and the fact that her
husband (the son of -an emigre who fought
Napoleon and the Revolution as a Russian
colonel) had died a Polish rebel against
ezardom, the Comtesse and all her family but
one daughter were, with other Russo-Polish
nobles and intelligentsia, herded in a cul-de-
sac and ruthlessly butchered. The title,
created by King Louis XVI. to reward the
family’s war record (which, from the 13th
century to date, includes two State Coun-
cillorships, 13 knighthoods, four Croix de
Guerre and other medals for gallantry), now
reverts to the head of the French branch,
who, being an Aussie of close on 20 years’
standing, prefers to carry on with the modest
title of “Digger” earned by three years with
the A.I.F.
The jampot collar was the fashionable
neckwear at the Hugh Dixson garden-party in
honor of Dr. Weeks, the new headmaster of
Trinity Grammar School, at Dulwich Hill.
The doctor, who hails irom Nelson (M.L.),
is a tall man with a thrilling profile and
looks as though he carries a stoushing right.
Though nominally he has c over to tram
the youth of Dulwich Hill, there’s a secret
idea that his real object is to pluck the
Sunday Times male beauty prize. All the
leading reverends present made speeches,
commencing with Warden G. A. Chambers,
who handed a verbal glad-hand to the new-
comer, his lettuce-green gowned wife and
the family. The Marcel-waved Dean of
Sydney declared his little eulogy in Hamlet-
like tones, _ and other sky pilots kept the
traffic moving, including the new arrival,
who told old tales dressed up as new, and
sounded altogether a twinkling, good-
humored sort. Meantime knight Hugh Dix-
son, who had lent the scentful grounds of
Abergeldie for the flutter, sat looking more
like a fragile Pilgrim Father than ever.
Daughter Mrs. Tliornett wore handsome
froclting of ivory morocain rich in satin
applique. With this she had a duck of a hat
of ivory crinoline swathed in oyster-grey
ribbon. Mrs. W. E. Shaw was another
nabob at the party; and the Dean Talbot
lady s lilac-toned frocking, creamy pallor and
attractive ginger top were one of the after-
noon s joys.
After its weekly luncheon, quite half the
Cavalier Club “went on” with George Lam-
bert to view the portrait of himself which
he did as an entry for the Archibald prize,
but withdrew upon finding he was not eli-
gible for the 400 guineas. When George
called a halt before the old Darlinghurst
Gaol, the occupants of the limousines looked
first shocked, then incredulous, but meekly
followed. It isn’t as bad as it sounds, for
the old gaol is now the new Technical
School, and it is under the thatch of this
that George is storing the portrait of him-
self in an old-gold velvet dressing-gown, with
a bowl of gladioli placed where it will best
call attention to his waistline.
In the sweltering days of last week the
city’s big fluff houses turned on their advance
winter show. It was like packing blankets
over a body parboiled in a vapor bath. But
woman turned out in large numbers to the
displays, and cooed over the new knitted coats
and skirts, which are as aloof from the ori-
.ginal home-knitted jumper as mosaic is
from a patchwork quilt. The new garments
have a mediaeval outline, and some of them
look as though cut from old French tapes-
try—the sort of thing a lady from a Morris
scheme might have slipped on before shoeing
her head through the casement to listen to her
special troubadour singing her charms by the
light of the moon. _ One young evening frock,
with hooped skirt in lilac tones, carried a de-
sign of tissue ribbons woven with roses and
odds and ends of garden bloom, and was
altogether suggestive of a valentine. An-
other in velvet the color of a golden plum
was the sort of thing Mrs. Macbeth might
have worn when mixing the haggis over-
night for an early breakfast in Glamis
Castle.
Sculptor Nelson Illingworth has just com-
pleted a striking bust _of Thomas Henry
May. M.D., F.R.C.S.,
who made Bunda-
berg (Q.) his head-
quarters in 1880,
and never left it for
keeps till he went
west in November,
191 G. He was hos-
pital doctor and
G.M.O. till 1915, in
his spare time a
naturalist (he made
a unique collection
of Queensland
shells), and all the
time a benevolent
citizen. The bust is
that of an impres-
sive-looking man
with a thinker’s
head and a perfect
example of the aqui-
hue nose. Cast in bronze, it will be handed
by the widow to the hospital to which he
gave so much of the best that was in him.
The heavy atmosphere that surrounds the
union Club was agitated one afternoon last
week-end by an army of women with faces
grimly set and the brolly of determination
in their grasp. They weren’t Bolshies;
they were the do-or-die advance-guard of
the Domestic Service hunters. Mrs. Beat-
rice Macdonald, Mrs. F. Aronson and Mrs.
Edmund Playfair had sounded the rally, and
every Woman’s Movement leader was on
the doormat of the Bligli tearooms on the
stroke of 3.30. The gathering was a pre-
liminary canter of the proposed Domestic
Assistance Association, which has for its
object the importing of Merely Ermyntrudes
from the Cold Country. The D.A.A. will
supply, or help to supply, passage money
on condition that the assisted one will pro-
mise 12 months’ domestic service—in the
Backbloclcs if necessary. Miss Preston-Stanley
nearly burst the balloon by mentioning that
the Feminist Club already had assisted
immigration in hand, and that its
scheme had the approval of brass-hats at
both ends of the voyage. However, after a
Niagara of words, Miss Preston-Stanley con-
veyed that the Feminists would willingly
allow themselves to be absorbed in the larger
scheme. Dr. Mary Booth, Dr. Grace
Boelke, Ruth Beale and kindly-faced Mrs.
Orams, from the Salvation Army, added to
the mountain of suggestions, while Mrs.
Edmund Playfair brought no words but only
a cheerful smile and a smart hat to the
party. Still, as nearly everybody else made
a speech, the proceedings went on till 5.30,
and then it was decided to leave the com-
mittee-making till a later date.
This is a little picture of A. E. Cutler,
formerly engineer-in-chief for Public Works
and lately general
manager of Walsh
Island, whose cap-
able head is about
to fall under the 60-
is-too-old axe of
the Public Service
Regulations. Already
he has entered upon
long leave prior to
retirement. Cutler
is a Londoner, and
got some of his edu-
cation at Marl-
borough when Max
O’Rell was on the
staff. After building
sugar-mills in N.
Queensland and Fiji,
erecting and con-
trolling gold-mining
plants at Croydon,
with brief interludes in other private and
State jobs, he joined the N.S.W. ser-
vice in 1890. A dozen years later
he was made superintendent of Cocka-
too Island, and soon found a life’s dream
taking shape. He had never tired of advo-
cating an Australian Navy, and he had the
satisfaction of putting together and launching
the destroyer Warrego and building up to
the launching stage the cruiser Brisbane,
the first really Australian-built warships.
Cockatoo passed to Federal control, and Cutler
was commissioned to supply a State dockyard,
so Walsh Island came into being. The good
Australian now retires to the Myall Lakes,
where he will have plenty of opportunity
to indulge his favorite pastimes—yachting
and hauling up misguided fish on the end
of a string. And with him goes as generous
a woman as ever made a good man happy.
The Institute of Journalists decided to
patronise the home-product the other day
instead of the usual imported article, and
gnawed a bone in honor of Dr. Ward and
Johnnie Sandes. Above the salt sat Monty
Somer, W. H. Cummins (Hobart Mercury)
and Holtz (Argus). Dr. “Whiskers,” look-
ing more like a benevolent daguerrotype than
ever, made a great speech concerning the
power of the Press —it must be, he claims,
the governing hand in any Democracy. (The
Grand Old Man, incidentally, comes from
Taranaki, and the rockers of his literary
cradle were Mt. Egmont and the local
Herald.) His speech ended on a note of
prophecy, and only the closeness of his hair-
cut saved him from looking a venerable
Michael trumpeting forth the glory-to-be of
the Press. Johnnie Sandes, who goes pre-
sently to shed a kindly light over the Mel-
bourne Sun, meandered gently along through
London and France, chatting about old Syd-
ney friends. Frank Fox he mentioned as
having been recommended- by Kipling to com-
pile some special war-time records.
Padre Angus King’s daughter. Mary Chris-
tabel, of Haberfield, flashes a diamond ring
on her left hand. Alexander Henderson,
elder son of the G. L. Finlays, of Campbell
Town (Tas.), knows wdiat it cost.
Sydney Stock Exchange got its youngest-
ever chairman last week. He is Vincent
Brownhill, who started life as office-boy w T ith
T. H. Martyn, whose partner he now is. An
imp of. an office-boy he probably was, for he
is an inveterate jester, and as an imitator
of bulls and bears and other animals, human
and otherwise, known to the brokers he is
unmatched.
Randolph Bedford is back after his year
or so in the U.S.A., bringing with him fat
lecturing engagements for 1924—Randolph
is easily the best talker among Australian
writing-men. He swears that Uncle Sham’s
prohibition is an utter failure; but —well,
he is 3st. lighter than when he left this
still-damp country. And that takes some
explaining.
Composer Roy Agnew comes back from
Melbourne with a sheaf of glowing notices of
lus works. lie seems really the forerunner
of a national school of music-writing; and
the long-threatened Town Hall concert that
is to send him abroad for at least one year’s
study is now being seriously discussed.
Estelle Beere, who is the Minnie Everett
of Maoriland, is in Sydney, staying at the
Hotel Mansions. Estelle runs the swaggah
dancing-classes of Wellington, and includes
among her pupils two of Governor Jellicoe’s
little lasses. The popular Viscount and his
lady send their children to the ordinary
classes twice a week. Once a week only
they have a lesson in classic dancing in
the vice-regal seclusion of Government
House. Two Wellington girls owe London
success to Miss Beere. One is Doris Scott,
who toured Asia once in a Freddie Shipman
co.; the other is a small chick of 17
who is dancing with Pavlova’s ballet.
Estelle and the Russian lady were students
together, so Thurza Rogers—that’s the
thistledown-toed one’s name—comes in for
quite a bit of notice from the exquisite
original of the Dying Swan.
Rose Bay Amateur Ladies' Swimming
Club, having vigorously revived after its
little set-back, hopes great things from
Madge Johnson, just turned 16, who has
been doing some fine times. A month ago
she did the hundred in one-twenty; then
she got that down to one-sixteen, and the
other night did one-thirteen in choppy
water. She has grasped the great art oi
fast swimming—to keep up the pace between
strokes. If she sticks to it they hope she
will turn out to be a champion. . But, there,
you never know with these young things.
Girls have so many distractions.
. Nellie Stewart is staying at a farm out-
side Medlow. She has been there for the
past two months putting the polish on her
book, “The Story of My Life.” She has
daughter Nancye’s baby boy with her.
Nancye and her husband, Mayne Lynton, are
playing in. “The Flaw” at the Cri.
Mrs. Hughes, a Wellington (M.L.) minia-
ture painter, who came over to spend the
summer in Sydney, ran into a small army
of visiting Maorilanders who clamored to
have their little Jacks and Jills recorded—
among them the Orbell clan. She has fin-
ished her last commission, and is breathing
freely on tlie_ heights of Neutral Bay. She
tells of Dulcie Deamer and her sister that,
as kiddies, they had a menagerie of carved
wooden prehistoric animals —too unorthodox
for Noah to have ever taken into the ark.
The Deamer father was a doctor in Feather-
stone, and Dulcie had a little sister who did
marvellous things with the pencil. That
one is now living in Belgium.
Fritz Burnell, who has written some
charming verse in and out of The Bulle-
tin, is back in Sydney, bringing a whiff of
Hyde Park and Piccadilly with him. He
turned up to his new job on the Sun the
other day with cane, gloves and spats!
A Brisbane postscript:—
Our Sir Matt, who has not been very fit, had to stay
away from the race for the Australian sailing cham-
pionship, which ended in The Vision carrying the blue
ribbon on her jib, or garboard strake, or wherever sail-
ing-boats carry trophies nowadays. Marjorie Johnston,
whose father is chairman of the 18-footers club
(sounds like a race of giants!), and Speaker Bert-
ram officiated in ribboning the winner. The launch
Grace was filled with Westralians, and the R.Y.C.
had a lot of cobbers on the Joyce.
But even though his Ex. was off color Government
’ouse opened wide its doors to the Neyliarts, from
Highbrow Boston, who have since gone off in the
Tango Maru in the direction of China and Japan.
The Hon. Mrs. Algy, daughter-in-law of the Earl
of Ducie (till recently plain Mr. Moreton), is off
to Yepoon to have a chat with mum and dad before
She meets the Earl on his return to Maryborough.
The fact that Lily Svensen will be Mrs. White-
house on February 2 moved Mi's. Svensen to give a
shivoo in her daughter’s honor at the Bellevue, and
Mrs. Whitehouse celebrated the proposed acquiring of
a daughter-in-law with a party at the National roof-
gai'den. Music at both parties was supplied by Lily
Svensen and her friend Doreen Morgan.
As a send-off to Flora Moffat, who has since gone to
England, Phyllis Billington called together friends to
dine and dance against a pink-auid-mauve background.
Among the jazzers were Spanish-looking Blanche
MeAulay and sonsie Mary Grant. Mrs. Dick Billing-
ton chaperoned.
Foundation Day saw a good gathering at the Ascot
races. Mrs. Darcy Winten, from Augathella Downs,
paraded a smart effect in black and white, and the
captain’s wife from India, Mrs. Stanfield, wore mastic
and brown. Mary Grant was a vision in white
embroidered muslin, and Susie Spencer, late of Roma,
was in mauve and grey.
A.B.’s from the Orsova decked the Albert hall in
pale blue flags and palms for a show by their ship’s
concert party in aid of the Seamen’s Institute.
Bishops, majors, canons, officers from the Orsova, and
pretty ladies filled the hot hail, while houris sold
sweets and programmes.
Miss D. Edkins piped to enable a squad of society
girls to jazz at Bonhill amid gerberas, asters and
gladioli ; and on the same evening the Ladies’ Harbor
Lights Guild lit up the Reg Hillcoats’ home, whereat
officers from the Surrey and Wangaratta were among
the joyful hoppers.
Agent-General Jack Fihelly’s wife and kiddies are
now housed at Bowen-terrace. Mrs. Peter Murphy
gave a dinner at the Bellevue for her daughter the
other night.

One of the Dudley Earl’s daughters is
engaged to a Maorilander, and she will pro-
bably . be bagged by Dunedin as a regular
inhabitant. All the Dudley daughters have
blossomed into the grown-up world since we
knew them. Even Lady Pat Ward, the baby
of the family, is “out.” She was a deb. of
the last London season. Report says she is
a brilliantly beautiful girl with a dash of
dad’s audacity. Sassiety expects her to make
a select deal in the matrimonial market.
The State Governor will issue plans and
specifications for a new private sec. when
he gets to London. Since he came here he
has had a queue of letter-sorters—Neil
Smith. Commander Haggard, Gerald Grove
and Major Wilkinson. Their passing re-
minds one of the comment by H. 11. Munro
on a famous dowager’s cooks. “They
were good cooks as cooks go,” he said, “and
as cooks go, they went.” The same might
apply to Stradbroke’s official buffers, who
develop a sudden yearning to leave after
giving every satisfaction. Why doesn’t the
Governor follow the example of his under-
study, C. J. Irvine, and try a lady amanu-
ensis?
The marriage of singer Isabelle Bredin
and George Fairbairn was a magnificently-
staged affair, which started off solemnly to
a full choral accompaniment at Malvern St.
Johns, and ended frivolously at St. Kilda
Carlyon s. The bride, led by Charles Brown,
walked regally to “The Voice That Breathed” ;
she was enfolded in creamy satin backed
by yards of brocaded train, over which rioted
a covey of pearl-embroidered birds and
pounds of gold grapes. A veil of old Lim-
erick lace was flown from a pearl coronet,
and a white prayer-book replaced the usual
floral trophy. Bridesmaids Olive Davey and
Kate Peters wore silk, one white, the other
pink, and both had tulle on their heads and
water-lilies in their hands. Mrs. Tom Mac-
Dermott, as matron of honor, lightened grey
brocade and a black lid with red roses. ° A.
"• O’Dwyer and Claude Fairbairn saw the
handsome bridegroom through the nerve-
racking moments, and he bore up well even
while the melancholy “Abide With Me” was
warbled in the registry-signing interval.
Oscar Asche is grinning at the rumor that
he is building a mansion at Brighton and
contemplates joining the J.C.W. directorate.
Ihe idea of playing a comparatively small
part in Australia would never occur to a
potentate like Asche, nor would the idea
receive strong consideration if the Firm pro-
posed it. The portly producer has other
plans. He may remain in Australia another
12 months; after that he may go to S’Africa
and, possibly, South America, with “Cairo,’’
"Kismet” and “Chu Chin Chow.” The
attraction in South America is the cosmo-
politan population of Buenos Aires, which
js said to have put a good deal of money
into some Yankee managers’ pockets. And
there is also a market for large spectacular
shows at Rio Janeiro and at Monte Video.
Last Friday night saw a fashionable re-
opening of Prince’s Amateur Club at Anzac
House, this smartest of young fast-goer re-
sorts having been closed since Cup Week
Mamie Watson, May Beatty, Gladys Mason
and others dropped in after show-time, and
noted that the dressiest Melbournites have
Sot into long skirts. Indeed, one matron
had drapery dragging the ground. Major
Eric Henty appears to be running the jazz
club (which seems to gets its name “Ama-
teur” from the band composed of musical
members), and if strict rules can command
success the Major will get it. A substantial
subscription fee gives no member the right
to enter without registering the names of
friends who are brought in. Every member,
too, is. required to have his own cupboard]
or his own naqie on his own particular
bottles, anyhow. This custom, presumably,
indicates some _ subtle form of compliance
with the Licensing Act, or else it means that
nobody, as the merry jazz grows mixed, shall
drink out of the wrong bottle without run-
ning a risk of detection in the act.
The other afternoon Mrs. Harry Emmerton
dressed her South Yarra parlors in pink for
a farewell at-home to her musical proteges,
Teddy Cahill and George Brooke. Thev at
last are off to tempt fate and fame north of
the equator. Mrs. Emmerton hostessed in
grey georgette sandwiched between slices of
grey lace. Her daughter, Mrs. Norman
Brookes, who had oiled down from Portsea,
was armored in henna and red flowered silk.
Leather girded her waist and fur outlined
her tricky little hat. The Albert Miller
widow was there, also the Bridges, Best and
Gilruth dames, Dr. Charlie Ryan and his
wife, Speaker Mackey and his, and the
spouse of Administrator Urquhart of the
Northern Territory. Little Elaine Brookes,
up from the seaside to convalesce under the
grandparental wing after a gastric attack,
fluttered in white muslin and pink ribbons.
Melba duly extended the hand of welcome
to little Wilma Berkeley and auntie Ada
Casey wEen they got into the Fog late in
December, and the pair tasted their very
first English plum pudding with the Dame
at Christmas luncheon. The star-to-be pulled
a horseshoe and a swastika out of some opu-
lent bonbons which gladdened the feast.
"That means luck!” cried the diva. Auntie
and niece have unpacked in a flat in West
Kensington, near the Nellie Rowe School,
where Wilma is to get her scholarship voice-
training.
Frediswyde Hunter-Watts (Mrs. Alan
Wilkie) boxed it at “Cairo” on Friday even-
ing, looking spirituelle in a scrumptious gold-
and-black cloak. She brought along the
übiquitous Tommy Cochrane as support. It
is mooted that she may play one of her
favorite Shakspearean heroines with Oscar
Asche as the ’ero. It would be an interest-
ing experiment—a kind of mixture of the
Queen Anne and Chippendale types of act-
ing. The Wilkie couple are dallying in Mel-
bourne for a short holiday before making
another tour.
Melbourne will miss Eddie Goll, the
Bohemian pianist who has become, one of
ourselves. He has a deep feeling for Aus-
tralia, and intends to return after his world-
tour, though without a doubt he would take
his place in the first rhnk anywhere. Goll
is an artistic personality. To a sympathetic
listener he will play for hours, illuminating
his interpretations with profound comment
and humorous anecdote. He has many
stories of Emil Sauer, one of the most bril-
liant of pianists, and his old master in
Vienna, who had the reputation of throw-
ing more students out of his room than any
other master on record.
At one of the performances of “Cairo,” the
six-year-old son and heir of Cecil Humphries
was watching the show from behind the
scenes. A female attendant stood ready to
suppress the scream that was expected when
the lad saw his father downed by the Her-
culean Ali Sha. But there was no need for
anxiety. When the bump came the young-
ster turned to his guardian with the remark:
“I knew he’d get that —he was looking for
it.”
Violet Cohen, a clever little musician in
her teens, is one of the ex-pupils that Abbots-
ford Convent is proudest of, and the needle-
workers at the convent are now busy em-
broidering a wedding veil for the lady. She
is engaged to marry Gotal Movitz, who has
adopted Melbourne as his home, but comes
from Birmingham, U.S.A.
This is a portrait of Jean Daley, who
made an unsuccessful assault on the Koo-
yong seat in the Labor interest at the repent
Federal elections.
She is an Australian
of"the third genera-
tion, and, though a
Victorian, is linked
up through her
grandparents with
early Sydney history.
Her grandmother,
Mary Mailer, be-
longed to old Parra-
ma 11 a, and was
present at Bishop
Broughton’s first con.
firmation service at
the venerable stone
church. Jean Daley’s
vivid personality is
known in pretty
well all the States
through her presence
at various industrial conferences. She has a
fluent and forcible tongue, has written
sheaves of articles on political subjects of
interest to women, and has gained almost
every office open to her in the A.L.P. At
present she is nursing the wounds sustained
in the recent battle, murmuring the while,
A time will come!”
The Apple Island is a happy hunting-ground
tor wandering minstrels, for it takes them
to its heart and spreads much hospitality in
their way. The Scottish societies recently
S€ ®t , tliere a “We Four” quartette with the
added attractions of Dolly Stewart and Neil
Mclnnes, and they had a wonderful tour of
the nor-west coast towns. Dolly Stewart
by the way, will probably join Walter Kirby
m some warbles during the Hobart race sea-
son. Walter has lately been in Bananaland.
The William Balfours, of Killara, Cul-
cairn, are off for a jaunt to Britain. He
was at the first meeting of the local shire
council, and has been a member ever since,
poor fellow. The late James Balfour, of
Round Hill squattage, the Vic. Leg. Council
and pious memory, was William’s dad. It
was at Round Hill, by the way, that the
legend “God Lives Here” was inscribed over
the lintel, so that visitors might make no
mistake as to the sort of house they were in.
William married into a nice old Scotch
family, and the tourists will visit the home
of Mrs. William’s ancestors.
Justice Schutt has just blown back from
Colombo and a lazy holiday, looking fit as a
fiddle and with no suggestion of “nerves” or
other such worrying modern attachments.
Freda Sternberg, one of our brightest pen-
women, is ruffling her plumage preparatory
to a flight to Europe via America. She will
step oft' at New York to greet her pal Margaret
Wycherly, of “The Thirteenth Chair” fame.
Freda is a lass of wide experience. She has
fed and tucked up full-bodied germs in their
little tubes in a bacteriological lab.; written
yarns for The Bulletin ; secretaried Dame
Melba during a tour; led Alexander Watson
through the Commonwealth; kept Conan
Doyle’s spooks in order; and aided Alan
Wilkie to spread the gospel of Shakspeare.
And lately she was O.C. the women’s sec-
tion of the Melbourne ’Erald during Maisie
Maxwell’s absence in Europe.
Xaves Rivers, a Melbourne youngster with
a remarkable voice, has been engaged for a
year’s concert work
in U.S.A. He is to
sing on platform and
also for Edison re-
cords. Rivers is a
boy soprano who
soars up to E in alt:.
His mother has
given him all the
musical tuition he
has had so far, yet
he has a fine opera-
tic repertoire. Mon-
signor Rella, of the
Vatican Choir, took
much interest in
him, and this has
led to an invitation
to go to Rome w'hen
his American season
is completed. Mean-
time, the boy, hav-
ing a turn for invention, is busy on improve-
ment to a machine for taking wireless re-
cords of songs.
Mrs. Edmund Jowett departed on the
Macedonia on Saturday, taking with her a
very precious charge—a grandson bound for
Eton. Jowetts have done bravely at the
old school for many a year.
Arthur Staughton last week steamered off
to Colombo to meet his decorative wife and
daughter Lorie, who are returning from the
Cold Land. Lorie gladdened her trip bv
engaging herself to an Anglo-Aussie called
Shaw, whose, father fed his flocks in the
paddocks adjoining the Staughton sheep-
works.
Fred Sinclaire, the Melbourne parson
who has run for some years an institution
of his own, the Free Religious Fellowship,
has set off on the grand tour of Europe.
An Oxford scholar, and late lecturer and
examiner in English at Melbourne Uni., he
is one of the foremost Australian exponents
of the “higher criticism.” But his “modern-
ism” did not prevent him teaching languages
at one of the big R.C. schools. He has a
larger following now than when he was
at the Unitarian Church. In those days he
had one. of the smallest congregations in the
town, his Shavian or Chestertonian sermons
being caviare to the general. One rainy
night, being asked how the attendance had
been, he replied that he, the parson, had
turned up, anyway.
Two. of South Yarra’s dressiest sisters
were discussing the weather with a rather
severe auntie who dotes upon facts and
figures. The girls were sure that January
had been awfully unseasonable this year,
while aunt pointed to the Bureau’s announce-
ment that the month had not been cooler
than the average, on figures, but had seemed
cooler because the “disturbances” had been
more often “southern’’ than “tropical,” in-
stead of the other way round, or something
to that effect. “Oh, how silly you are,
auntie,” remarked one of the misses; “ask
the drapers whether it was a decent January.
Why, we have hardly worn white frocks
since the week before Christmas!” When
you come to think of it, the truth about
weather is largely told in drapery, and the
shops, know most about it.
It is murmured in the best Italian circles
(the Bohemian caffis of the outskirts) that
our,Edward P. is visiting quietly in Swit-
zerland, but that he makes swift motor
rushes oyer the frontier into Italy. In this
way he is not officially visiting in Italv, but
Spaghetti concludes that the very eligible
bachelor is skirmishing.
The South Yarra Tennis Club has reserved
Saturday, Feb. 24, for its opening shivoo.
It was to have been let loose by Lord
Forster, but his Ex. regretfully blue-pen-
cilled the engagement owing to the pressure
of political matters; and though it is hoped
the Stradbroke Earl will oblige, the club
seems to be quite forgetting Caulfield races.
A feature of the afternoon will be exhibition
matches, in which all our tennis stars will
shine, save Gerald Patterson, who doesn’t
happen to be a member of the club.
It now appears that the picturesque story
about Verna Johnson’s car was a case of
mistaken identity. She and her mother had
the car with them at Portland the other
week, but it was a car owned by another
Johnson that toppled over the cliff. The
8000-pounder is still alive and doing well.
A titled gent.-hejp who recently chucked
the wrap-carrying job was an excellent sport
and a really good fellow; but his wife took
the dignity of her position very seriously, and
used to spread in large waves over every
appearance of the vice-regal suite. At one
very jolly dance given by a club, the supper
was a swanky affair, and a long table at
the top of the room was reserved for the two
Governors and their people. There was a
quiet little table branching off from the special
spread, and a youthful host advised his per-
sonal party to “cut in there along by the
wall” while he got the Importants settled at
their food. They were just rustling down
into their chairs when the aide’s lady waved
her hand. "I have a party of six,” she said.
“/ want this table.” The ousted women
smiled faintly, gathered up their vanity-boxes
and faded into the background, only to be
met by an exasperated young Aussie host
who asked, “Why don’t you stay put?”
The trouble is we Australians are such a
herd, y’know, alongside some English visitors.
Mrs. Caron, widow of musical-conductor
Eeon, can tell a weird story of postal-service
mysteries. About Christmas-time she re-
ceived a letter from daughter Irma, bearing
tidings from New York of her engagement
at a Broadway show. Together with
this letter for madame, who lives at Kew, the
postman delivered Christmas cards directed
to relatives and friends of Irma at three
addresses'. Now, how did those four letters
directed to various addresses come to be all
delivered to Mrs. Caron at Kew?
A little gossip from Adelaide: —
Doris Egerton Jones, co-author of “The Flaw,”
now being played in Sydney, has packed a great
deal into the comparatively few years since she left
the schoolroom. A B.A. degree, a year or so of
law, half-a-dozen successful novels and magazine
stories, much travel, marriage and a small son are
among the items. Incidentally, it was her legal
ambitions that got the Act passed making it possible
for women to practise here.
Miss Milvain Good, who has been teaching at the
Geelong Girls’ Grammar School since she took a
brilliant Uni. degree here,, is now going to put in
an alleged holiday looking into educational matters
on the other side. She expects it to last 12 months.
From England comes news of the engagement of
the Frank Goodes’ son Kenneth to Mary MacArthur,
of Kelso, Scotland. War broke out just after he had
annexed his engineering degree, and, when he was
through with Fritz, a chance to go on with his
profession in the Cold Country decided him to stay
there.
Simpson Newland was duly invested with the
insignia of his C.M.G., and J. R. Oliver was handed
his the Other morning. Both were lunched
afterwards by the Bridges in the presence of the
editors of the three dailies, the Chief Justice
and the Premier, Lancelot Stirling, Richard Butler,
Josiah Symon and various members of the Newland
clan.
Moralists have a new text in the steadily-mounting
tote figures. There is barely a wage-earning flap-
per who can’t give you a sure thing for any meeting
from Mount Gambier to Oodnadatta, and hardly a
housewife who can’t squeeze a shilling or two from
the weekly bills in the abiding hope that she may
turn it into pounds. Watch the feminine young
person from bank and office buy her evening
paper, and see which bit of it she turns to first—
and you’ll probably decide that for once the moralist
knows what he’s talking about.
Clare’s Polo Week ended with polo pony races
at the Stanley Flat course, with a win in the Ladies’
Flutter for Gipsy Good, on her fiance’s Dorothy.
Other feminine winners were Miss Stawell, Mrs. S. 11.
Ayers, Miss Birks and Miss Phyllis Bray. Mrs.
E. W. Hawker (he is president of Clare Polo Club)
handed out the week’s prizes, after which ponies,
competitors and spectators took a prolonged rest
cure. Some of the poloists aren’t as young as they
were.
Victor Harbor has been going gay, too. There
has been a dance at Mount Breekan (the big board-
ing-house built out of the smoke-blackened remnants
of the Hays’ old home.), a children’s party at the
Stanley Murrays’, another at the H. 11. Duttons’,
and a small dance at the Casino, with Mrs. Andrew
Mueeke as hostess.
Miss- Lulu Gillespie has decided to anchor herself
and her voice permanently in this village. She
came back to her old home at the end of last year,
after a long spell in Europe.
The long Adelaide beach—not a rock nor a
stone to break the sand, no surf, no sharks—has
discovered the foolishness of , being under half-a-
dozen sets of by-laws. The one-piece bathing-suit
used to be permissible at Largs, Semaphore, Grange
and Henley. Yet visitors from the city who
wore it without let or hindrance at any of these
places were hauled up and fined if they happened to
go to Glenelg or Brighton, a few miles further
along. The town-clerks concerned have now had a
conference, and the simple garment is to be barred
everywhere.
The “balloon game” is the rage at Glenelg this
summer. Fourteen people compete in blowing up
colored balloons by turning handles; the first one
up touches a button which lights a lamp and rings
a bell, and that means a box of chocs., one being
handed out every two minutes or so. The com-
munity is! “saturated” with chocs., and local shop-
keepers find their customers gone—so much gone
that a deputation lately faced the local council and
begged that the promoters should be made to give
prizes in cash.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
“ON TOP” WITH
MICK SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKLE
“Tren”: Stanley Melbourne Bruc-e, who
stepped lip when Hughes stepped down, has a fine
sporting record. Captain of Melbourne Grammar
in his college days, he was, at cricket, a good
stumper and a vigorous batsman ; at football, a fol-
lower who bogged in with the best; and, on the
water, a member of the college crew. A challenge
eight-oar race between the Melbourne and Geelong
Grammar Schools, in which he rowed with the Mel-
bourne crew, was the forerunner of the present eight-
oar head-of-the-river races. He is now president
of the Old Melburnians. At Cambridge Bruce was,
in 1904, a member of the crew that won the Uni.
boatrace, and he was asked to coach other Cam-
bridge crews in later years. Twice wounded in the
war, he came back with the M.C. and the C. de G.
* * * *
Recent Westralian form must have
greatly impressed the V.R.C. handicapper. Scorpius,
the English horse imported by a Groperland pasto-
ralist, has Bst. 111 b. in the Newmarket Handicap
(Wish Wynne is topweight with 9st. 121 b.) and Bst.
81b. in the Australian Cup. Jolly Cosy, who iust
beat Scorpius in the Perth Cup after the English
horse had made all his own running (and after he
had thrice vanquished her at w.f.a.), is on the same
mark in the 18-furlongs race, and receives a mere lib.
from Sister Olive, 51b. from King Ingoda and Special-
ity, and 61b. from Stare and Harvest King, who head
the list. P. A. Connolly’s mare has been very harshly
treated. A dangerous lot in the sprint are Furious
(Bst. 111 b.), Salatis (Bst. 101 b.), Sunburst (Bst.
91b.), Easingwold (Bst. 51b.), St. Speed (7st. 101 b.)
and All Gold (7st. 31b.). The last-named four-
year-old ran away with a race at Randwick 10
months ago, and was thereupon put aside for the
Newmarket. Nothing reads better at the weights.
And there is a good race in Furious if specially
reserved for that one race; between seven furlongs
and a mile she galloped grandly in the Chelmsford
Stakes, but the severe race settled her for the
Spring. In last Australian Cup three-year-olds fin-
ished first and second, but this year the youngsters
have been well looked after. The Cypher has Bst.
71b., Whittier Bst. 41b., and the disappointing
Caserta 7st. 131 b. More leniency has been extended
to the four-year-olds, Heir Apparent (7st. 101 b.),
Sister Olive, Stare and Harvest King; and one of
them—Heir Apparent, for preference, if he can be
brought to the post fit and well —may do the trick.
* » * *
“0.K.”: The Cypher’s easy win at a
Melbourne down-the-line meeting last week was not
so surprising to stay-at-home punters as the colt’s
starting price—20 to 1 in a small field, and the
V.R.C. Autumn meeting only five weeks distant.
Trainer Guinane is said to have thought Victory
more than merely likely, but he abstained from
putting sugar on the horse. The racecourse
crowd forgot how Eurythmic won his first race in
Melbourne at a long price, because Holt’s stable
thought him wanting in condition, and how many
another high-class horse, in training for big events
ahead, and supposed to be not forward enough, has
given backers a surprise. So the tempting odds
were not taken, and there was much cursing in con-
sequence. The Cypher is a round-barrelled horse
who, even at Melbourne Cup time, looked big enough
to be above himself. His form in November proved
him to be in great condition, and, allowing for
another three months’ growth, his burliness last
week should not have been alarming. True, Harvest
King, with the same business in view, ran unbacked
in this same race, but the black son of Comedy King
is a year older than The Cypher, and a bit of a
rogue, seemingly, who isn’t easily made fit and will-
ing to do his best.
* * * *
The Countess of Stradbroke has had no
luck thus far with her investment in racehorse
property. The two-year-old Mandalay, which car-
ries her colors, has never done more than get a
place in one or two of its several attempts. It
looks hardly good enough to win in moderate com-
pany. On Saturday, when backed down to 4to T
in a race at Epsom (Melb.), the annoying animal
was left at the post.
“Offsider”: They brought a nag from
Bowen (Q.) to a small country meeting, and there
seemed nothing abnormal about him till he won.
But the perspiration that came out of the brute in
running had something else with it. When
he returned to the paddock the hair of his coat was
oddly curled. “Warm water and soap” was the
official order, and the sports who had pinned—or
stuck —their faith to treacle sot “life.”
Con Drew spins a yarn :
“See here,” said CMien the bookmaker to his
partner, who acted as clerk, “to-day ve start ott
different. Ve haf no puntin’ ?”
“No puntin’!” exclaimed Isaacs. “Vhnt do yer
mean?”
“I mean vhat I thav,” returned Cohen. If yer
vant ter haf a bet, bet with yer own money, andt
don’t be divin’ yer handt inter the bag effery nfe
minutes as yer done last day. It aind’t bithness.
Having thus reproved his partner he mounted his
stand and gave tongue. “I’ll bet on the firth raith, ’
he shouted. “Deuces the field.”
Now Isaacs had got the wink that several horses
were going to be scratched, and he wanted to have
a bet before Cohen became as wise as himself.
“Vhat’s ther goodt er dynamitin’ them?” he
snorted. “Vhy don’t yer bet?”
“Bet?” rejoined Cohen. “Aind’t I bettin’.”
“Get avay with yer,” jeered Isaacs. “Kveryvhere
else I hear plenty of sto 2. Dig into it. man.”
Thus admonished Cohen jolted the odds up half a
point.
“I’ll have yer,” yelled Isaacs, thrusting some
money into his partner’s hands. “Fife poundts to
two Miss Ivo.”
As the notes rustled into the bag a man dashed
past calling out the numbers of the scratched horses.
“Crikey!” Cohen gasped, “there’s only four run-
ners and Miss Ivo looks a certainty. How much haf
I laidt against her?”
“Only that fife poundts ter two ver laidt me,”
chuckled Isaacs.
“Is that all ?” exclaimed Cohen. “Veil, I neffer
let a paltry bet like that stop me, Isaacs. Book me
fife poundts ter two the same horse, and then ve
knock off.”

“Tuart” : Allison, of the London Sports-
man, “Special Commissioner” of that paper for 32
years and one of the world’s admitted authorities
on the thoroughbred, has been saying that the con-
temporary Australian racehorse isn’t a patch on
the hardy breed that used to win races like the
Oesarewitch, the City and Suburban and the Ascot
Gold Cup. For this he has been taken to task by
a Sydney turf writer, the same who increased the
gaiety of the nation by remarking, apropos of Beau-
ford’s fluky win in the Chelmsford Stakes, that
“Wood proclaims Beauford the best horse he has
ever ridden,” and “I think if all the jockeys that
have ever ridden could be resurrected to pilot him
once they would say the same thing.” As to that,
were it possible to bring them together at the top
of their form, I would back Aurum or Newhaven
to take on Gloaming over a mile and Beauford over
12 furlongs and beat them the same afternoon.
Aurum, by the way, is described by Allison, who
bought him for 5000 guineas on Mrs. Langtry’s
behalf, as “by far the best horse W. R. Wilson ever
owned,” and included in the list was Merman, the
greatest stayer in England round about 1898 and
’99. W.A. was likewise assured by W. T. Robinson,
the English trainer, and his jockey brother Nat,
that the son of Trenton-Aura was “by far the best
horse they ever had in their stable.” Unfortunately
the colt went wrong and never raced on the other
side. According to Allison, the average Australian
breeder expects to get a good English sire for a
fraction of the price realised in countries like France,
Argentina, the U.S.A. and (before the war) Ger-
many, Austria and Russia. The Australians, he says,
by purchasing “numbers of cheap and flashv sires
with specious pedigrees, have contrived, in the last
25 years, to greatly depreciate their own stout old
lines of blood, and to produce animals which are
readily beaten by second-class importations.” When
the deeds of Merman, Newhaven, The Grafter, Aus-
tralian Star and Maluma in England are compared
with those of Rebus, Lavendo, Lucknow, King Offa,
Quinologist, Shepherd King and a dozen more in
Australia, who will say the English critic is wrong?
* * * *
“Simon”: How is this for devotion to the
national sport? At Lamington (Q.) they pull up
the railway-line every race meeting to let the nracls
have an uninterrupted flutter round the best bit of
level country thereabout. Races over, all hands get
busy on plate-laying, and soon the iron horse totes
most of them to other innocent enjoyments.

In a challenge series against Botany on
Saturday, Carr, the East
Sydney flier, won the
100yds. in 10 2-ssec., and
the 220yds. in 24sec. W.
W. Hunt (Botany), who
represented Australia in
the sprints at the last
Olympic Games, was a bad
second in each race. On
the same day Kirksev,
whom Carr is to meet in
M.L.. beat the best of the
North Islanders over the
hundred (10 2-ssec.) and
the furlong (23 3-ssec),
while F. Merchant put up
new figures in the broad
jump (23ft. 3]in.) and
the shot putt (43ft. 54in.).
Kirksev and Merchant are
representative U.S. athletes,
and an attempt should
have been made to bring
them to Australia. But
the Commonwealth is
streets behind other coun-
tries in the control of most
varieties of amateur sport.
E. W. CARR, the
fastest Australian
sprinter since
Donaldson.
“Wilfrido” : There is one lesson in sport
we might learn from the U.S.A. There it is the
rule rather than the exception for the cracks to take
the young ones in hand and endeavor to bring them
on. In Australia, with the possible exception of
Rugby football and swimming, the attitude of the
champions towards the juniors is one of mild toler-
ance or amused apathy. Look at the results of the
American system of intensive training. The fore-
most American swimmers, Johnny Weissmuller and
Helen Wainwright, are aged 17 and 16 respectively.
The tennis wonder, Vincent Richards, is 19; the
golfers, Sweetser and Bobby Jones, are both 20 ; and
the polo champion. Tommy Hitchcock, is only 21.
In diving, cycling and handball the champions are
respectively 17, 18 and 20.
In a leisurely swim at Manly (N.S.W.)
Andrew Charlton added the quarter-mile supremacy
of the northern suburbs to his sequence of successes.
Obeying dad’s orders, the lad took things easily,
and the time was slow —smin. 44 4-ssec. Had a
record been made it would not have been recognised,
as the take-off was every inch of Bft. as against the
standard 18in. At Perth (W.A.), the same day, Bill
Harris, the heavyweight from Hawaii, beat Moss
Christie (N.S.W.) by five yards for the quarter-mile
Australian crown, with Taylor (W.A.) third. The time
was fair, smin. 35sec. Also, Joe Soussari, the Queens-
land fisherman, won the quarter-mile breast-stroke
frcm Les Iren (Vic.) and T. Smith (W.A.) in 6min.
39sec. And the good news comes from ALL. that
Violet Walrond and Gwitha Shand are on their way
to Sydney to meet the slickest among the Aus-
tralian mermaids.

“K.E.”: At least one oarsman is not too
old at 56. The winning crew in an eight-oar race
with which the Melbourne R. C., now amalgamated
with the Civil Service club, opened its season was
stroked by Ted Horsburgh, who dates back to the
year (1866) in which the C.S. body was founded.
He won the heat by two feet and the final by
three-quarters of a length, and didn’t look a bit dis-
tressed after the proceedings. The strokes of the two
crews he defeated have each won two championship
eights since the war.

Fighting on his own dunghill. Jack Cole,
the Sydney middleweight, showed in the first minute
that he knew too much about the game for Algie
Daniels, of Tasmania. Cole used much better judg-
ment in placing his punches, and Soon had the gore
running from Algy’s nose and mouth. Algernon, who
is a Digger, took his gruel stoically, but he was in
a bad way in the sixth round, and just before the
end of the seventh Cole got in the convincing punch,
a short right on the stomach. It made Daniels so
sick that he couldn’t continue.

In the last round of his light at Melbourne
with English Jack Josephs, Fred Segar, the S. Alls,
welterweight, was knocked down three times. The
third clout sent him to sleep, but the gong clanged
simultaneously with the tick of the ninth second,
and after gazing meditatively at the recumbent
mass of meat the referee declared it the winner.
The decision was correct according to Australian
usage, since Segar had won 17 out of the 20 rounds,
but in America it would have gone to Josephs.

Twenty-five or thirty years ago Tasmania
had some good cricketers, but the Eadys and Burns
have departed and left no successors. The Speck’s
first eleven was terribly defeated on the Melbourne
ground by a Victorian second eleven. After Lars-
down, Bailey and Gamble had put the islanders
out for 217, Victorians took possession of the
wicket for two days, during which they made 1059 —
Ponsford 429, Love 156, Brown 87, Bailey 82,
Herring 66, Schneider 55, Mathers 46, Gamble 32,
Lansdown 25 n. 0., Sandford 23, Mullett 16 and
Sundries 42. Ponsford staj’ed in for eight hours,
hit the thousandth run, established a world’s record
for one hand in representative cricket, and covered
the Vic. selectors with confusion. They have per-
sistently left him out of the State’s first eleven in
favor of the 39-year-old Mayne.
“Trekle”: A. C. Facy, who bore the brunt of the
Tas. attack against Ponsford and co., once played for
South Melbourne. He carefully shook hands with Pons-
ford and Love as each milestone in their huge score was
passed. C. Martin, a left-hander, with the old
Saunders run from behind the umpire, learnt liis
cricket at Geelong Grammar School. G. P. Henty,
the ponderous, ’keep, and F. Butler used to belong
to Melbourne, and G. H. Allan played for Richmond
several seasons ago. Love, the ex-Sydney man,
batted beautifully for Victoria, but was helped by
the Tas. captain. He turned or glanced straight
balls, pulled anything loose from away on the off
to square leg time after time —all his leg shots
are executed in masterly fashion—yet to the last the
Tassies massed on the off. Until Jack Ellis’s poor
performance in Sydney, when he let off Macartney,
Collins and Kippax, Love was regarded as an inter-
loper, but now he is being proclaimed by the pro-
letariat as the coming wicketkepp.
Kippax’s recent 197 ranks twelfth on the
list of tall scores made by N.S.AV. batsmen against
Victoria. Murdoch’s 321 in 1882 is the highest, and
Harry Moses’s 297 not out in 1888 is next. The
others are: M. A. Noble (281 in 1905), T. Andrews
1247 not out in 1920), Percy McDonnell (239 in
1886), Victor Trumper (230 in 1901)), R. Minnett
(216 not out in 1912), M. A. Noble (213 in 1909),
Austin Diamond (210 not out in 1907), C. G<
Macartney (201 in 1913), and Syd Gregory (201 in
1908). F. Tarrant’s 206 in 1908 is the highest by
a Victorian v. N.S.W., and Clem Hill’s 356 not out
for S._ Aus. against N.S.AV. is the greatest knock
made in Sheffield Shield cricket. Now comes Pons-
ford’s 429, which tops the record for all inter-State
matches (Charlie Gregory held it with 383 tor
N.S.W. against Queensland) and pulls Archie Mac-
laren’s 424, for Lancashire v. Somerset, from its
pedestal.
Maclaren’s Englishmen won the third
Test (and the rubber) against Maoriland by an
innings and 20 runs. For the M.C.C., who scored
401, young Lowry hit up 130 in 167 min. He is
a native of the Dominion, and it was unkind of
him to reserve his best knock of the tour until he
got home again.
The only noticeable features of Saturday’s
cricket in Sydney were Tommy Andrews’s 141 for
Petersham (320) v. Cumberland, and Dr. McCristal’s
contribution to Randwick’s score (4 for 360) v. Pad-
dington—it was the same as Tommy’s. Andrews was
in a brisk mood and 22 fourers rattled the pickets.
Though unlucky against Victoria he is in great form
this season. In grade matches he has made 427 runs,
averaging 53.37. When the Petersham man gets going
he is beautiful to watch —his cut is as elegant as
Kippax’s, and he is sounder on the leg side.
* * * *
“Basil”: The ethics of sportsmanship
according to cricketers are a standing mystery to me.
The best tennis-players invariably neutralise the
effect of an umpire’s wrong decision by wilfully giv-
ing their opponent the next point, even at the expense
of losing- a set or the match. But nothing like this
ever happens in cricket. Men might be caught be-
hind the wickets or palpably have their legs in front,
and if the umpire decides in their favor they con-
sider they have the right to make the most of the
new life 'that is granted to them. Take the case of
Kippax, who scored 197 for N. S. Wales against Vic-
toria the other day. According to Carl Willis the
youth was out l.b.w. very early in his innings, but
the umpire considered he was not, and Kippax went
on blithely getting runs ; though if the tennis prac-
tice ruled he would have spooned the next ball into
the nearest pair of hands and retired from the fray.
That is, of course, assuming that Kippax Was out
and knew it. Again, Andrews was given out
1.b.w., although he is prepared to swear that he played
the ball before it hit the pad. How much finer the
game- would be were the umpire’s bloomers corrected
by the player (or the captain) most -concerned. But
I fear the awful yearning to look well in the aver-
ages will always prevent it. The averages, you see,
only show a batsman's record in runs, or a bowler’s
in wickets, but refrain from mentioning that he
might have had a cat’s luck in getting them.
* * * *
“Ivip”: The solemn atmosphere of Mel-
bourne pennant cricket has been enlivened lately by
South Melbourne supporters, who are obviously get-
ting fit for the foot-
ball season. At the
match between their
club and Hawthorn-
East Melbourne, on the
latter’s ground, they
were particularly i a
evidence, and several
of the home team’s
batsmen were subjected
to a blast of strident
and derisive comments.
Then Le Couteur came
in, and there was a
lull in the storm o f
ribaldry. The silent e
was broken by a Haw-
thorn enthusiast.
“Garn,” he shouted,
“voif can’t barrack ’ini.
Yer don’t know ’ow to
pronounce ’is name.”

S.A. Cricket Association has taken up the
suggestion of Joe Darling, now M.L.C. in Tasmania,
for a serious presentation to George Giffen, largely
on the ground that his devotion to cricket in the
eighteen-eighties damaged his chance of promotion m
the G.P.O. at Adelaide, where he is still employed.
Darling backed up his proposal with 10 guineas, the
N.S.W. Cricket Association has sent £5O, and S.A
will give the net proceeds of the approaching match
against Victoria. Also, a committee to take up a
general subscription has been appointed: Clem H ill
(who says he will play in the match if wanted),
Tracers, Gordon Campbell, Scrymgour and Hodgetts.
Giffen “jeopardised his prospects in life through the
time he devoted to the gcune,” their manifesto claims.
“S.T.S.”: The new English humorist,
Cyril Alington, has a lot about Australian cricket,
in his farcical story “Mr. Evans,” which turns on
the hero being sent for in a hurry for the final
Test in London, and the dodges tried to keep his
wowser employer from missing him. Of course his
bowling was magnificent. “In the striking words. of
the genial and burly skipper, ‘We could do nothing
with it.’ ” Also, he won the match by one wicket,
by the sort of 20 not out (against “the fastest
living bowler”) a man played solely for his bowling
would make, not the sort a fiction-hero mostly
makes. His cuts and drives all went to the boundary
over the heads of the slips, or at long Igg. When
he got home, a literary friend welcomed him with
a neat parody of Marlowe:
Is this the hand that mocked a thousand slips,
And foiled the hopeless hops of Gregory ?
* * * *
“Winkle'’: The fact that each Australian
cricketing State has produced an all-round champion
who stands high above his fellows was responsible
for more arguments among sporting Diggers abroad
than the width of Sydney streets or the smell of
the Yarra. Noble. Armstrong and Giffen each had a
host of admirers. Tasmanians were equally positive that
had Eady been given a fair spin he would have
equalled any of them. Noble must, I suppose, be
given the palm. He was classed by experts as the
best point in the world ; Ranji and others proclaimed
him the most troublesome medium-paced bowler of
his time ; his batting was of the highest class ; and
such a cricketing encyclopaedia as “Plum” Warner
gives him the credit of being the first captain to place
his team in the present fashion —to give away the
ones and save the fours. As all-round athletes, Giffen
and Johnny Worrall would take beating, for, in
addition to being international cricketers, they were
champion footballers. But Worrall ranked far below
the other three named as a bowler.

Stanley (“Solly”) Hill, who played cricket
for some years in the S.A. XI and also for N.S.W.
during a short residence in Sydney, gets half a
column to himself in London Daily Telegraph of
15/12/’22. That paper’s golf expert professes to
have taken him for the moment for his greater brother
Clem, on meeting him on the links. “There was
the same sturdy build, the powerful, well-shaped
shoulders, the rather pale features, with deep-set,
piercing eyes.” “Solly” still plays a lot of club
cricket in and about London, but has lately taken
to golf, and is described by the enthusiastic Cockney
writer as “one of the hardest hitters I have met for
many a day. He hits the ball with almost inhuman
ferocity, and was occasionally outdriving Ray.”
“Allbutt” : The Barraba team, which dis-
tinguished itself at the country tennis tourna-
ment at Sydney, is composed of the Spencer
brothers, R. and C., and the Williams brothers,
G. R. and G. 1., who are the Spencers’ cousins.
They all learned the game on their own courts,
and I have known the quartet to play a whole
day without knocking off for a snack.
OUR SPORTING PRIME MINISTERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A London paper, commenting on Mr. Bruce's
qualifications for leading a Government, remarks that
he possesses those sporting proclivities which Aus-
tralians demand in their Prime Ministers,
lie pulled at seven in the Cambridge boat,
At golf he puts with care and drives with speed:
Facts that are quite sufficient to denote
His admirable fitness to succeed
Where Barton, Deakin, Watson sat in rote,
Where Fisher ruled and Cook and Hughes—and Reid.
What though their politics were diff’rent sorts,
The whole darned crowd were sports.
Essential ’twas to office. “Toby” played
A really admirable game of whist;
A twenty break at billiards Hughes has made;
Watson when young could bowl a ball to twist
Enough to make poor bats a bit afraid;
Few were the games that Andy Fisher missed
In mining days when pennies upward flew.
Couldn’t he head ’em, too!
Deakin, the silver-tongued, at croquet shone
On lawns where mallets click and ladies bunch ;
Cook, when a union sec., the gloves would don
And floor opponents with a kidney punch;
Reid vanquished all his rivals, one by one,
Our champion trencherman at either lunch,
Breakfast or dinner. Sportsmen proved and true,
All had to be, their job to fasten to,
And now there’s Bruce —a “Blue” !

The absence of sugar or other sweetening
properties make Eno’s “ Fruit Salt ” invaluable
for the treatment of rheumatism, gout, sciatica
and lumbago. ENO attacks the causes of such
conditions at their source, and in addition to
relieving existing pain, its daily use lessens
considerably the chances of their recurrence.

“Azrim”: My own professional experience
is that talking during anaesthesia is rare (B.
18/l/’23), though occasionally one over-
hears a whispered prayer or a virulent out-
burst of profanity.
“The Deacon”': This beats me. There’s
a man I know who has a voice like a crow
and an ear like nothing on earth. That’s
in his waking moments. Yet when he drops
off to sleep it is a pleasure to hear his soft
tenor rendering two or three lines from some
song heard previously. This case, of course,
differs considerably from that of the man
or woman who may do something similar
under an anaesthetic. Invariably they re-
produce what they are already capable of
doing equally well.
Edmund Fisher remembers the days of his
youth and Essen’s :
Cable-talk about trouble in Essen stirs my early
recollections of the dirty town it was when fata
sent me there to get a German education. It came
about this way. In 1865 Lady Augusta Stanley lost
the services of a grim-looking spinster w'ho had
been nursery-governess in the family. She had
captured the affections of a scholastic German, one
Dr. Ivluge, and they got married and went to Essen,
on the strength of a guarantee that a little batch
of English pupils would be sent as boarders in their
painfully new' house in Ring-strasse. My father’s
medical adviser arranged the guarantee, I fancy.
Anyhow, the half-dozen English pupils were all
known to him; his own son was the eldest of the
crowd, and my brother and I were two of the
others.
Essen, in those days, contained 20,000 inhabitants,
we were told, of whom 10,000 were workers at Ivrupp’s
cannon foundry; the morning march of Krupp’s army
always awoke the town. We were all youngsters,
w r e parlor pupils of Herr Dr. Kluge, and I was the
youngest of the lot, but even to my infant mind
there seemed far too much Krupp and cannon
about Essen on the Ruhr. Not that we were in
immediate touch with the Ruhr at Essen; we
had to go to Mulheim for a row on the stream,
now so much talked-about, whose name signifies
rest and quiet. Essen on the Ruhr, as I knew
it in 1865, meant Essen on the Quiet. And it was
on the quiet. Thrice, or oftener, during the few
months I lived there, the old King of Prussia
visited the dirty little town unofficially to spend
a week-end with Krupp. The upright figure of
tall, lean Krupp on horseback, riding beside the
tall, stout, mutton-chop-whiskered King William is
in my mind’s eye as I write. Tall Crown Prince
Frederick also was a frequent visitor, and I remem-
er the local excitement over the condescension of his
Royal Highness in stopping his barouche at the
principal sausage-shop. His wife, being the English
Pnncess Royal, was of special interest to Herr Dr.
Kluges pupils. It seemed to me that there was
something wrong in these visits of kings and princes
to so mean a town on account of its Krupp and
cannon foundry. The child’s nostrils inhaled a sus-
picion of the truth, although an approaching war
with Austria was not yet talked of. Militarism was
not obtruded on one’s sight in Essen: the local
males were plodding workers who took their Sun-
day ease on the kerbstone, airing velvet slippers
and smoking long pipes with gaudy china-bowls,
and the military band at the bier garten came
from Dusseldorf. Nevertheless there was always
warfare in the wind that blew around Krupp’s
cannon-factory. Dr. Kluge, in expansive moments,
talked of war—of how Prussia had righteouslv taken
Schleswig-Holstein from silly Danish control'a year
before, whilst British Government had foolishly pro-
-6S +e " c >r ' me Minister, we learned, was a
matter for detestation. Herr Dr. Kluge taught us kids
to repeat a little German rhyme and translated it as:
nn avi DeVI J S , got a Son ’ he is surely Palmerston,”
° dld we lod Se any patriotic objection.
cI ’ f fter four or five months of school in
K uges domicile, I fell sick of typhoid fever, and
all I know of the next seven weeks was told me
afterwards. Essen grew horribly afraid of the
fever-struck chil d at Herr Dr. Kluge’s. No woman
could be hired to nurse me. My father came at
once from London, my young stepmother with him
and she shared the nursing with a nun from the
R.C convent, the only available lady-help in Essen.
Typhoid fever in that town, where the drainage
system was primitive and the gutters of the main
wJfVm” Wlth , bl °° d from butchers’ slaughter-houses,
, . e in deadl y dread. My people found me
drawing my nearly-last breath under the eonven-
rTo’ial, •? er f an s,| burban treatment of the period.
Unluckily for me, who might otherwise have been
an angel all these years, my father wired for his
friend the family doctor to hurry across from
London, and Dr. Dempsey rushed off to Essen’s star
hotel. As soon as I was considered out of danger
my people returned home, but, ere they left, Dr.
Dempsey had taken the other five pupils, including
his own son, back to London with him. My sick”
ness had emptied the academy for young Englishmen,
and deprived the small boys of Essen of their favorite
pastime, which was to shout remarks on our foreign
origin behind our backs.
Then came the weird revelation of German character
and logic. Whilst I was getting strong enough to
travel, the greyness of his outlook drove Dr. Kluge
to desperation. Why should he suffer because a
thoughtless little brat had acquired a fever under
his care? He drew up a long bill of liabilities
for my dad to settle, if he would be so kind.
Dad’s readiness to “shell out” had impressed
Essen. Bored stiff while he was waiting for me to
be nursed back to safety, he had vainly tried to buy
a casual inspection of Krupp’s wonderful factory,
after learning that Krupp had forbidden such visits
to foreigners, more particularly Englishmen. Kluge
must have thought dad a good mark. So the bill
charged a lot of money for the inconvenience and
worry my illness had caused the Kluges, a lot of
money for the loss of parlor pupils in the present,
and a lot more money for the loss of what the
school might have been had my fever not burst up
the show. Poor Kluge’s ideas were all on the
debtor side of the ledger, it appeared. The fact
that lack of drainage had put my progenitor to
great expense and anxiety never occurred to him.
He demanded compensation for the pupils he’d lost
and the ones he never had. He declared his intention
of holding the calamitous boy (my skin-and-bony self)
as hostage until reparations were made. But at last,
when the utter absurdity of his claim had been
explained to him by a lawyer, the poor learned
doctor consented to give me up if an elder brother
was sent to collect me.
Luckily for the stupid Prussian scholar, his wife
had a grain of sense. She pitched her tale of woe
to Lady Augusta Stanley aforesaid, and that dame
wrote a letter to the Times in which the awful
misfortune of the charming young wife of the
brilliant German professor was painted in pathetic
colors. Subscriptions were earnestly invited. Sub-
scriptions rolled in. My fever was the making of
the Kluges. My father, being a wag in disguise
contributed 20 guineas to the fund, thus giving
Herr Dole to suppose that the magnanimous donor
was a conscience-stricken creature heartily ashamed
of himself.


Just Charming.
By “PHLOX.”
’* A CAREER is all right, Audrey, as
j /-\ far as it goes; but I don’t think
it is sufficient to satisfy the aver-
age woman’s heart.”
“I suppose, Aunt, that’s why you gave
up your medical practice and married Uncle
Edward.”
“Yes. I was getting on in years when I
married. I had begun to feel that want of
companionship with someone I could really
call my own—someone who was more to me
than a friend.”
“Those are my sentiments, Aunt. I feel
I have a more interesting career than most
women with a lectureship at the University
and my research work in archaeology, but
there’s something wanting.”
“And that something, my dear Audrey, is
a husband. I’ve been through the same thing
myself, and I know —it’s the same old story,
old yet ever new. I loved my profession as
you love yours, but alone it was unsatisfy-
ing.”
“Yes, Aunt. I realised that when I saw
Nita Anderson’s radiantly happy face as she
announced her engagement to be married;
then I realised that even a career does not
compensate for a life of single blessedness.
You remember that jolly girl who passed so
brilliantly in Arts! She’s going to marry
Professor Butler.”
“And I think, Audrey, it’s about time
you looked around for a husband. You’re
not cut out for an old maid, though of late
you’ve acquired one or two little prim ways,
and the average man does like a little bit of
fluffiness about a woman.”
"What do you mean?”
"I mean that you want to take more pains
with your general appearance; fluff: out your
hair a bit, and so on.”
“But I don’t happen to have fluffy hair.”
“Then you’ve got to fluff it; also to im-
prove your skin; in fact, where Nature has
been deficient, supply the deficiency with
art. That’s what I do. But I promised
to meet Uncle at 6 o’clock, and it’s nearly
that now—I must be going. Good-bye,
Audrey, and think over what I’ve told you.”
Audrey Johnson was thinking over what
her practical aunt had suggested when she
was interrupted by someone wrapping on her
study door.”
“Gome in,” she called.
Professor Livingstone’s pretty wife
entered. She had come to ask Miss Johnson
to join in a send-off to Nita Anderson.
After this had been satisfactorily arranged
they talked of all kinds of things.
Audrey had often noticed what pretty,
fluffy hair Mrs. Livingstone had, and how
beautifully she dressed it. Why not ask
her for some hints on hairdressing?
Mrs. Livingstone felt quite flattered at be-
ing asked for advice by clever Miss Johnson.
“So much depends,” she told her, “on the
way the hair is shampooed as to whether
the hairdressing will be a success. Per-
sonally, I always use Stallax,” said Mrs.
Livingstone, “and I find it makes the hair
beautifully glossy, fluffy and easy to dress.”
“And that’s just what I want,” replied
Miss Johnson.
“Do you ever use a hair tonic?”
“No, I’m afraid I’ve never given much
thought to my appearance, but I intend to
turn over a new leuf in that respect.”
“I can give you a recipe for a simple,
home-made tonic. You buy a package of
boranium from the chemist, mix it with
a quarter of a pint of bay mm, ana rub into
the scalp occasionally.
“Do you know,” went on bright little
Mrs. Livingstone, “a little while ago I was
getting quite grey, and I happened to hear
a woman in a chemist’s shop ask for two
ounces of concentrate of tammalite and three
ounces of bay rum to mix with it. She
then turned to her friend and said that there
was nothing like it for restoring grey hair to
its original color. I thereupon ordered the
same, and now I haven’t the sign of a grey
hair.”
“I’m glad to know of that, too, for I’m
continually pulling grey hairs out of my
head.”
“But, Miss Johnson, when you begin to
look after your hair you must also look
after your skin, and I find that there’s
nothing like mercolized wax for keeping the
skin soft, clear and free from blemishes.”
“My aunt was telling me that I badly need
a skin food, but she didn’t tell me what to
use.”
“All the well-preserved women I know
seem to use mercolized wax. It contains
oxygen, and removes the old worn-out skin
so imperceptibly and painlessly that you
don’t know the process is going on until
some fine day one of your friends will re-
mark, ‘I don’t know what you’ve been doing
to your skin,' but it’s like a baby’s.’ ”
“Then, that’s certainly the cream for me.”
“Well, if you care to come round to my”
place when you have time I will show you
a pretty way of dressing your hair, relieve
me, my husband always keeps me up to the
mark, and is delighted to hear people whis-
per as we pass, ‘Look! isn’t she just charm-
ing?’ ”

“Benvenuto,” at Sydney Theatre Royal, is
described as a romantic drama. The scene
is Florence, and the time when the 15th cen-
tury was young—
When, with amorous dalliance the fashion,
The gallant best fitted to court
Was the swordsman; when art was a passion
And murder a sport.
The play is rich in gore and spiced with
enough pleasant buffoonery to take the edge
off the frequency of the Florentine of the
period going down like a stuck pig. The
plot really doesn’t gain anything from the
prologue and the epilogue, which represent
a remote descendant of the hero in modern
Paris acting in the same set of circum-
stances, mutatis mutandis , as his ancestor
would have done in mediaeval Italy—some-
thing the same sort of dramatic device as
is employed in “Ambrose Applejohn’s Adven-
ture.” Nevertheless, the two extra scenes
effectively round off the story and bridge
the gap that separates modernity from the
Medicis.
* • * *
Louis Bennison is in his element in the
part of the famous sculptor equally adept
at producing deathless works of art, like
“Perseus,” love-making, revelling, abducting
a Duke’s ward, running interfering persons
through the vitals and awaiting hanging with
defiant nonchalance sooner than reveal his
lady’s whereabouts. lie is equally adept at
the airy braggadocio which is an essential
characteristic of the many-sided Cellini; his
bravery and resource carry off all his vanity
and gasconade, as with the Brigadier Gerard
in Conan Doyle’s story. His finest acting
is in the workshop act, where his master-
piece has to be completed within an hour or
two to save the sculptor’s life and set the
seal on his fame. The stage craftsmanship
at this point is excellent in its realism. Louis
Bennison, of course, is the dominating figure
throughout; he has a fine stage presence,
and is a finished actor in his debonair, robus-
tious line. Every word is clear and cleanly-
cut, whatever tumult is raging around.
* * * *
The hero is capably supported by Miss
Lizette Parkes as Felicia Allori. This lady
undergoes a good deal of transformation from
the time the frozen-dumb bride-to-be is car-
ried off out of the power of a singularly
unattractive Italian nobleman of the period
till she is found masquerading as her artist-
lover’s second apprentice, a thoroughly win-
some if smudgy-faced boy-impersonator. Her
brief scenes with Ascanio (Leonard Nugent)
and Pantasilea, the model (Miss Marie
Eaton), are rendered very spiritedly, in
Benvenuto’s rare absences. Miss Marie
Eaton is a fine study in vamping tem-
pestuousness, and Leonard Nugent plays
capably a drab and rather homely part. Of
the others Vivian Edwards is an imposing
Cosimo De Medici, Duke of Florence; Leslie
Victor a sufficiently snaky and jealous Baccio

Bandinello to make a fine foil to the illus-
trious Benvenuto ; and Robert Homans a
very proper and convincing villain as Count
Felippo Strozzi. The piece is well staged;
the ladies’ pannier dresses in the opening act
and the glad rags in which Benvenuto arrives
at the finish are a credit to Florentine taste.
At Sydney Cri. Emelie Polini, the Enoch
Ardenish wife of the gifted inventor with
the jazzing nerves, continues to bang the loud
timbre] of passionate emotion in “The
Flaw.” There is a suggestion in the new
play of a boiled-down novel by some for-
gotten writer like Miss Braddon or James
Payn, and a full flavor of what Londoners
used to call Surrey-side melodrama in the
hectic situations that confront the heroine
at every turn.

The Sentimental Bloke and his en-
tourage are still demonstrating at Sydney
Palace that hearts as maiden-pure and lily-
fair may beat in Spadgers-lane as any-
where, and that shrewder as well as racier
reflections may be expected from rabbit-
hatvlvers and their donahs than from the
guests at a Government House shivoo. On
the stage, anyhow.

Princess’s.
Connie Talmadge has come to frolic at
Sydney Lyceum for a week. The chuckle-
some film, “Betsy’s Burglar,” is mostly a
matter of mistaken identity. “Flesh and
Blood,” at the same house, is, for its part,
mostly a matter of maudlin bathos, with Lou
Chaney at the tear-pump. Hoyt’s feature a
good bunch of cow-punching and poker-sharp-
ing thrills. With Thomas Meighan it is a
case of the same yesterday, to-day and for
ever; wherefore “If You Believe It, It’s
So.” featured at the Strand, isn’t seriously
different from “If It’s Raining Put Up Your
Umbrella” and the rest of them. Pretty
Justine Johnstone, in the additional at the
Strand, advertises a “Heart To Let”; but
she won’t be rushed half as much as she
would be if it wjis a cottage on her hands.
“The Great Adventure,” the beautiful
natural-colored F.nelish masterpiece at the
Crystal Palace, still keeps ahead of all rivals:
it reveals an artistry that many a jazz-
wearied soul is going to demand more of in
the future.

“Cairo” pursues its scenic career at Mel-
bourne Majesty’s without warmly commend-
ing itself to public love. Tales of decora-
tive murder and sudden death devoid of real
strength in everything save spectacular
effect can hardly win affection from a fri-
volous world. “Cairo” strikes the eye and
leaves the heart untouched. Nobodv believes
in the crass credulity of the pilgrims to
Mecca, and the rest of the slow-going
pageant abounds in incidents that would
excite profound disrespect for ancient East-
ern civilisation if anyone believed in them.
But the “mosaic of music and mime” is ever
good to look upon; also, it is sometimes
sweetly tuneful to the ear.

continues to trot remorselessly around the
stage in the steps of Humphrey, her spouse.
Also Humphrey continues to enjoy the brief
five minutes of self-assertion which leave him
more than ever at the mercy of May Beatty
aforesaid. Furthermore, Ireland Cutter still
adopts a style of comedy known as Gertie-
like, and Mamie Watson, Ena Dale, June
Roberts, etc., retain their good opinion of a
city that has received them so kindly, while
the chorus, ballet, lighting, dressing and
general smartness of Hugh Ward’s show re-
peat themselves nine times per week. As a
rule. Last week they did it 10 times.

The panto, at Melbourne Palace, having
outlived its rival at the King’s and out-
lasted the holidays, is now restricting its
energies to two matinees per week. "Dick
Whittington” has improved on a diet of hard
graft. The soloists make more of their songs,
which is no reason, however, why they
should not change them for others; the long-
comedian, whose actual height is getting on
for seven feet, and who looks not less than
eight and a half, is less crude than when the
panto, was young; the ballet wherein Verna
Bain makes a charming figure is much the
better for experience; and the Cat now goes
so far as to pull several yards of stocking off
the Dame’s leg. The humor of this leg-
pulling is not delicate, but it is triumphant.
Children get no fun out of subtlety in humor.
They go to “Dick Whittington” to get jokes
thrown at ’em —and to see other children
performing feats of acrobatics in the stage
street.

Local birds whisper in public gardens that
“A Southern Maid” is a beautifully pictur-
esque entertainment, supported by fine up-
standing personalities and singing voices to
match. The story of thq new opera at Mel-
bourne Royal slackens its hold of human
interest as soon as the absurd vendetta makes
an earnest request to be taken seriously;
leading characters here present less sem-
blance of reality than in “Maid of the
Mountain,” but they have stage surroundings
that even the greatest of characters might
be proud of. Luckily for them the English
yachting party carried gorgeous fancy cos-
tumes with them, and the vendetta push
makes a point of always striking the right
sort of bloodthirsty attitude at the correct
moment. In short, Gladys Moncrieff,
Claude Flemming and Howett-Worster have
much to be thankful for. Less cause for
satisfaction is evident in the cases of Sti-
gant, Mione Stewart, Nellie Payne and Pur-
dell, who form the comic-relief expedition.

Melbourne Majestic is giving prominence
to “Don’t Neglect Your Wife,” a Gertrude
Atherton yarn, which is supposed to pic-
ture faithfully the San Francisco of the
’seventies. Also Dorothy Gish gets screen space
as a joyous country flapper, and Larry
Semon in “The Show” unleashes a clump
of bewitching chorus-girls. The melodra-
matic reform of a crook at, Hoyt’s is pre-
sented with the ungainly title of “If You
Believe It, It’s So.” But “Human Hearts”
is the dish that attracts the multitude. It
spreads the glad news that a village black-
smith is runner-up to the Saviour in nobility
of character. “A Heart To Let,” another
winner at Hoyt’s, is interesting for the pic-
turesque deceptions of Justine Johnstone in
three different characters. “The Bells of
San Juan,” a Californian romance, is the
week’s offering at the Melba ; and the Bri-
tannia draws attention to “Steelheart,”
otherwise William Duncan, in a thrilling
close-up with a bear.

“The Lion and the Mouse,” at Adelaide
Royal, gives Guy Hastings a big chance in
Julius Knight’s old part of the autocrat, and
Fitzherbert gets right away from his usual
line in a Johnnie part. The personal popu-
larity of Claude Dampier gives the Dandies
a long start in their open-air venture, but
one of the coldest summers on local record
pulls in the other direction. Bears and
monkeys (not forgetting the ant-eater) con-
tinue to revel on the Majestic stage. Harold
Lloyd is particularly funny at Wondergraph
as a “Grandma’s Boy” who, under pressure
from the old lady, breaks out into daring
deeds. Funny, too, is the treatment of “Is
Matrimony a Failure?” at the York : answer
in the negative. Mack Sennett, at West’s, is
more dramatic than usual: the Grand and
the Pav. are quite dramatic, and very
American.
“Smike” : Caleb Porter, who was the first
Nero that Australia saw in “The Sign of the
Cross.” is exhibiting his large Roman nose
in “The Cat and Canary,” a new London
thriller that puts “The Bat” into the sun-
shine-comedy class. The play contains a
clawing hand of extraordinary melodramatic
significance, but the multitude’s spine is
turned to ice-cream by an unexpected device
for the removal of dead bodies. Porter has
only a minor part in the shocker, but, then,
he must be getting an old man now. He was
an experienced actor when Mrs. Pat Camp-
bell first took to the stage, nearly 40 years
ago. Australians most remember him for his
Nero, but he was pretty good as Desdemona’s
papa with Oscar Ascbe, and there was har-
rowing realism in his exit when he was
strangled by the same manager in “Kismet.”
G. P. Huntley, the English comedian, sell-
ing a pup to odd-jobber Chris Wren, at
the Sydney Tivoli.
From the scene of the uproar:—
“The Cenci,” Shelley’s dull drama, in which incest
is the main theme, hasn’t incited a rush to London’s
New Theatre, where Sybil Thomdyke and Robert
Farquharson enact the principal characters. Sybil
can’t rid herself of the Grand Guignol touch. She
spoiled the first half of the play by depicting the
melancholy Beatrice as a strident and suspicious vira-
go. Her work in the second part was more worthy
of her talent, but Farquharson was hopeless from
the start. He is a barnstormer, pure and simple.
He ranted and raved, struck attitudes and generally
carried on in the style of the actor-rs with whom
Bulletin cartoonists familiarised us of old: —
“Aigs aigun, Madam? Aigs aigun? Avaunt
with the cursed globules!”
Such is Farquharson. And yet it is alleged that
he was imported from Italy specially for the part.
“Ganesha” : Jos6 Levy, the bright and enter-
prising little manager of the London Grand
Guignol, introduced more than horrors dur-
ing his exciting season at the Little Theatre.
Short plays had never been popular in Lon-
don ; but Levy provided such a good all-round
programme that he filled the theatre at high
prices. There was only about one shocker
(adapted from the French, usually by him-
self) in five plays ; and even that occasion-
ally might have a psychological interest,
like the “Seven Blind Men” of Lucien Des-
caves. Levy wanted to give English writers
a show, though he thought they were better
in comedy than in thrills. Yet Reginald
Berkeley, a Maorilander and author of
“French Leave,” wrote “Eight O’Clock,” a
scene in a condemned cell, that was a sin-
cere piece of work. Some of the younger
writers will regret Levy, who was on the
lookout for short plays, and wanted some-
thing different from the conventional cur-
tain-raiser.
“E.F.” learns to smile:—
How these Americans love to preach to one
another! Plain, unvarnished teaching of moral
lessons appears to be the easiest means whereby a
dramatist can impress the great American public.
A preacher-like repetition of facts which every-
body knows (and nobody bears in mind when a
crisis arises) is made to appear like inspired wis-
dom if an American play-hero gets perorating. In
a long-ago U.S. comedy Fred Niblo closed the pro-
ceedings by telling Enid Bennett what a wonderful
city of human nature New York is. In New York,
he said—the orchestra playing soft and low, and the
prompter or somebody tinkling the warning bell
that bids the curtain be ready to descend slowly—
in New York the Rich and the Poor alike have
loves and hates, and Great Men have small worries
while Small Men cherish High Ambitions; and
Evil Thoughts spring up in Holy Places while
Holy Thoughts elsewhere are putting Evil Tendencies
to Shame, and much more to the same effect. In
“The O’Brien Girl” the principal ditty, whose
waltz melody permeates the entertainment, is
entitled “Learn to Smile.” It is the precept
that Ena Dale sings to Mamie Watson. Mamie
passes it on to her young man and everybody dances
to it. Learn to smile, just a Smile, free from
Guile, which makes life worth While, counteracts
plottings Vile, and is the best possible cure for
Bile, or words to that effect. It is the kind of
mush that starts a mushroom growth of popularity.
So Melbourne is Learning to Smile. It has taken
the copy-book maxim to heart. Soon we shall hear
Salv’army bands diffusing the glad tidings that a
guileless Smile makes life worth While and cures
the Bile. Just now a lone cornet-player blew the
melody up our street. I don’t see how an educated
smile can be free from guile. The sweetest smiles
I know are loaded to the very muzzle with guile,
and they help to make life worth while when the
lady lets them off. But I grow discursive.

“Blackfriars”: Is Tetrazzini coming here
or not? Either the people who have her in
tow are contemptuous of Tait publicity
methods, or the lady has dropped the notion.
Not a word relating to Tet. has been circu-
lated since it was announced that she had
signed up for an Australian tour, and who-
ever it was that undertook to manage for
her has modestly surrounded himself with a
great cloud. Yet for three months or more
there have been cataracts of mush about the
impending Moiseiwitch.
“Dido”: I wonder if the refurbishing of
Melb. Princess’s has entirely outed the
spook that once haunted the circle, and which
threw three or four actors and actresses out
of their stride. Interest in the goblin was
re-awakened by the action of a young decora-
tor employed on the job of dressing up the
theatre. Working overtime one night he was
discovered to have a candle burning by that
third post against which the ghost had
always been seen leaning in Hamlet-like
cogitation. Asked what the Gehenna he was
doing endangering the safety of the house,
he replied that it was a blessed candle he
was burning to lay the spirit he had seen
clinging to that pillar. And he swore he
had never before heard a word of the Prin-
cess’s ghost.
“Snell” : Surprise has been expressed that
Oscar Asche should have gone at the age of
19 to study his art, not in England, nor even
France, but in Norway. Oscar explains
that he was half a Norwegian ; Norway was
his father’s native place. Furthermore,
Ibsen was then all the rage, and Oscar dis-
played excellent judgment, as it turns out.
His early estimate of Ibsen proved the cor-
rect thing. Ib. was the best producer in
Europe, and as a member of various cos.
that were under his shaggy fist, young Asche
received an insight into the handling of drama
that has been of inestimable value to him.
He retains for the author of “Ghosts” an
affectionate regard that was not broken even
by Ibsen’s trick of slashing offending
actors, male or female, across the face with
his old hat.
“Norbell” : George Rignold was the daddy
of all producers. To hear him handling the
supers in “Henry V.” was an education in
stage direction. He had the fieriest Billy
Hughes of ’em springing to it in' one up.
With what ginger he would address his
army— ?
We few, we happy few, we band of — blanky. idiots!
Often in one word he could convey exactly
what he wanted. I recall him rehearsing
“Joseph of Canaan,” with Lena Brasch (a
Jewess) as the Joseph of the prologue, and
the author of the play, Rev. George Walters,
sitting at the prompt table. Rignold wanted
a more rapt expression on Joseph’s face.
Thus he encouraged her: “For God’s sake,
Miss Brasch, try to look more—more
Christ-like!" He knew.
. (Bond.) : Joe Coyne drew a blank
m ‘Dede,” the French musical comedy pro-
duced by Andve Chariot at the Garrick.
Though racy (and risky) enough in the
French original, it failed to catch on in
Cockaigne, and faded out within a month.
“It’s the first failure I’ve ever been associ-
ated with,” Joe told me, disconsolately.
“0.K.”: The Nile in Oscar Asche’s
“Cairo” is the most pretentious misrepre-
sentation of any sort of river that ever I
saw in melodrama. I suppose that a certain
scheme of lights could make it appear a
limpid moonlit stream, but as I beheld it
on its first night in Melbourne, and since
then, it is just a strip of tinted canvas,
stretched horizontally across the stage, \Vith
strips of staring white paint running length-
ways, top and bottom, and perpendicular
lines of very black paint in presumed imita-
tion of tree-trunk reflections. Such crude
backgrounds give one no chance to forget
them while the play proceeds. If the
“Cairo” Nile be really a daring triumph of
stage effect when properly lighted, why don’t
they light the thing properly and make it a
triumph? And if it now fails because Mel-
bourne Majesty’s is not the theatre it was
painted for, why not substitute a mild, in-
offensive river which doesn’t hit the rapt
observer in the eye?
“Old Un” : “But when did Charles Arnold
do the ‘smalls’?” asks “Orb” (B. l/2/’23).
Late in 1894, playing overland to Melbourne
after a season at Newcastle. I remember
it with rue, because Arnold’s invitation to
go along as a guest of the house was one of
two such which I had to decline—the other
being from J. C. Williamson, to go from
Sydney to Brisbane and give an opinion on
“In Town,” which the Royal Comic Co. was
there trying on the dog, with George Lauri
as Captain Coddington and Florence Young
as the dashing young Lord Clanside.
“Los Angeles”: “O.K.’s” pen-impression
of Wallace Reid (B. 25/l/’23) is all wrong.
I met Wallace in Hollywood many times
(lived there for three years and a half), and
can testify that he stood well over six feet,
was splendidly set up, had a resonant speak-
ing voice, and was as bronzed as a Manly
surf-bather. He was certainly not a drug-
fiend, and everyone who knew the man
mourns his death.
“Fax”: A couple of Australian musical
artists who have seemingly settled in
America for their pockets’ good are William
Conway, pianist, and Hector Goldspink,
tenor. When Goldspink returned to this
country some years ago, after training in
Italy, it was evident that he would be
wanted where big money is paid at mighty
vaudeville houses. Malcolm MacEacharn,
the basso, who sang with Melba in London
recently, will probably find his best market
in the same neighborhood.
“Cyngic” : In the way of sensational adver-
tisement of Artists at Home it would be hard
to beat a Melbourne ’Erald photo of Gladys
Moncrieff, sitting up in bed to read alleged
notices of “A Southern Maid.” Unhappily
for the ’Erapd’s purpose fair Gladys is still
a spinster. What was needed to complete
the intimacy of the advt. was a husband on
the next pillow, gazing adoringly at the lady,
with a Darling-get-up-and-sing-for-me expres-
sion.

imported to Aus-
tralia consigned to
Hugh Ward, is de-
scribed by the
faithful publicity
agent as a breaker
of hearts, and as
having played “the
big part” in “The
Land of Promise”
with Irene Van-
brough, as well as
lead in “The Man
from Toronto.” A
heart-smasher the
gentleman may be,
although I never
heard of him be-
fore. But God-
frey Tearle played
opposite Miss Van-
brough in “The
Land of Promise.”
The programme I
possess makes no
mention of Mul-
easter. And George
Tully was “The
Man from Tor-
onto,” both in Lon-
don and in Aus-
tralia. I hate to
contradict press-
agents, but there
are times when it must be done.
“Pedro”: The late Kate Rickards was
once a trapezist—one of the Vanoni sisters
—and afterwards ’Arry’s good genius.
When Rickards had exhausted even his
credit, when he was playing to the band, the
ushers, and the seats at the old York-street
Opera House, and in the dressing-room a
black-garbed family refused to be comforted
for the loss of the reeently-dead only boy, an
offer came of a lease of the Tivoli (then
Garrick) Theatre at a peppercorn rent, with
the right of a low-price purchase. ’Arry
was disheartened and afraid that Sydney
wouldn’t stand him at any price. Then for
the first time the far-seeing Katie intervened
in a matter of business, and persuaded him to
accept a proposition out of which he made
the quarter of a million which his heirs and
assigns have been spending in the courts.
“A.P.G.” : “F.S.” (B. 25/l/’23) seems to
have got more unalloyed enjoyment from the
Chinese drama than I did. I went to see a
famous actress in the native city, Shanghai.
She was very pretty and was dressed mag-
nificently. Her acting, also, was excellent.
But the effect of the love scene was spoilt
for me by the lady
expectorating pro-
fus e 1 y at the
moment of great-
est emotion. This
horrible spitting
habit is universal
amongst all classes
o f Chinese, s o
much so that the
“music” preceding
the expectoration
is known among
Europeans as the
Chinese National
Anthem.
“R.U.E.”: Mel-
ancholy to me is
the news that Fred
Collier has been
singing at Covent
Garden. Melan-
choly for this rea-
son—that he ap-
plied for a humble
job in “The Maid
of the Moun-
tains" (he told me
so himself), and
was informed by
the enlightened
management that
it preferred some-
thing imported.

Theatre, Melbourne.
wife, Elsie Treweek, thought it was time
to travel. Strange that, with perhaps one
exception, the only managers who give Aus-
tralian artists a show are not Australian.
“D.”: The Sun has paid Howard Vernon’s
widow £lOO for the serial rights of his
Reminiscences, and will publish them simul-
taneously in Sydney and Melbourne. As he
left them they were a huge jumble of views
on acting, society and religion (particularly
religion), mixed up with comments on plays
in which he had acted, and actors and audi-
ences he had known. The clever little lady
(she was Vinia de Loitte) got to work, and
in three months reduced chaos to order.
“L.H.P.”: “Second Murderer’s” recollec-
tions of “Cinderella,” at Melb. Royal (B.
25/l/’23), set me remembering that the
show ran 14 weeks and J. C. Williamson
confessed in the Argus to having cleared
£4OOO profit. That 1884-85 panto, had some
lovely scenery, and I well recollect the up-
roarious call for George Gordon on Boxing
night. Will Simpson was the clown in the
now-defunct harlequinade; Harry Benham,
the finest Pooh-Bah I ever saw, was the wicked
demon, and Julia Simmons the Fairy Queen.
Maggie Moore sang “Pretty Pond Lilies,”
and Nellie Stewart warbled “Dreaming” and
a waltz-song, “Love the Minstrel.”
“0.K.”: Dion Clayton Calthrop, part-
author of the prose section of “A Southern
Maid,” is a nephew of Dot Boucicault. His
father, handsome John Clayton Calthrop,
married Eve Boucicault, eldest daughter of
Dion, the Irish actor-dramatist. D.C.C.
picked his parentage wisely. The Bouci-
caults of to-day—Eve, Dot, Nina and the
rest—had a charming little actress, Agnes
Robertson, for mother, as well as brilliant
Dion for dad. The Calthrops, too, had
brains in the pedigree. John Clayton afore-
said was only a young man of 24, three
years on the stage, when he gave a striking
performance of a cavalry officah in
“Dreams,” a Robertson comedy, and he was
not much older, though much stouter, when he
played in “Philip,” taking the romantic part
of a brother whom Henry Irving had to
shoot with a rifle. Irving had to see his
brother fall, suppose him to be dead, and
cover him with a cloak before slinking up
the mountain path. At one matinee the
rifle had not been properly fixed, and no-
thing happened when Irving pulled the
trigger. He snapped again and again ; still
there was no report. His angry “Damn the
gun!” could be heard far into the pit of
the auditorium. Clayton, meanwhile, had
begun to reel about, as per stage directions,
and at last he fell for dead without any
assistance from the gun. Whilst Irving,
having covered his brother up, was giving
his tragic side-glance at the body as he crept
away, the body’s protuberant tummy could
be seen shaking with merriment.
“Blackfriars”: There’s a painful simi-
larity between the Williamson-Melba-Tait
list of grand operas for the coming tour and
those of former occasions. Charpen-
tier’s “Louise,” a picture of Paris in music
written a generation ago, is the most novel
among 20 operas to be offered, though several
sure winners could have been discovered
among the round score not yet produced in
Australia but doing regular service in New
York and Chicago. Wolf-Ferrari’s dainty
“Secret of Susanne” and his “Jewels of -the
Madonna,” Montemelli’s “Love of the Three
Kings” and Massenet’s “Juggler of Notre
Dame” can all be recommended to a man-
agement desirous of combining art with shekel-
raising. Melba’s judgment is always to be
respected, but it is doubtful whether any-
body in Australia would feel hurt if the
half-dead “Traviata” and “Romeo et
Juliette” were rejected in favor of operas
with a modern trend. Other works never
performed here, although the Yanks seem
able to stand them quite a lot. include “Fal-
staff,” “Boris Godounoff,” “Thais,” “Mefis-
tpfele,” “Mona Lisa,” “Pelleas and Meli-
sande,” “Rosenkavalier,” “Salome,” “Elek-
tra,” “Der Fledermaus,” “Zaza,” “Werther,”
“Eugene Onegin” and “Le Coq d’Or.”
“L.E.”: Covent Garden turned into a
music-hall! Arnold Bennett thought the old-
fashioned building, with all its shabbiness
and snobbery, had the finest interior in
Europe, superior to that of La Scala or the
Paris Opera House. The only disappoint-
ment I had was in the audience. I remem-
bered Macaulay talking somewhere of “Eng-
lish beauty gathered together in the boxes
at the Opera.” I looked round expectantly ;
but English beauty—fraus, wrinkled dowa-
gers, jewelled rags and bones ! Perhaps the
good ones were hidden behind the curtains.
“Fax” : Time was when Henry Irving and
his sons H.B. and Laurence regarded Ethel
Irving as an infringer of their rights to the
family’s theatrical name. They even sug-
gested that she should find another. To
which she replied that she was an Irving
from her birth, whereas the famous Henry
had been born Brodribb. It is all recalled
by the London production of a successful
play with Ethel as star and a young daughter
of H.B. in the cast.
“Norbell”: “Park Royal” mentions (B.
l/2/’23) that Kate Bishop, Marie Lohr’s
mother, was the original Violet Melrose in
H. J. Byron’s “Our Boys” when it achieved
its (then) record run in London. Amy
Roselle (Mrs. Arthur Dacre) was the other
young woman in the comedy. The two
actresses played together once more in Syd-
ney, at H. M. Theatre, June-July, 1895, in
“Esther Sandraz” and other shows, and again
in “A Scrap of Paper” at Sydney Cri. in
September-October of the same year. I re-
member the ladies talking over old times and
recalling how it was found necessary to have
a rehearsal of “Our Boys” once a month dur-
ing the four years’ run in order to bring the
performers back to the text.
“T.W.”: If German Elena Gerhardt,
greatest of all lieder singers, or Austrian fiddler
Kreisler descended on Australia, and if the
Firm risked producing an opera of Richard
Strauss, the blended results' would be like
those of a whiz-bang in a freezing chamber.
Yet an illogical people is eager to give its
gladdest hand to the new work of Kreisler’s
compatriot, Franz Lehar. Lehar’s “Moth
Girl” is as big a draw in Europe as his
“Merry Widow” used to be, and it is scor-
ing best of all in Italy. Australia is like-
wise ready to listen to the enemy in his
jocular moods, but frowns on him when he
is serious—verily an interesting bit of psy-
chology.
“Lond”: Marie Tempest is making her
London reappearance in “Good Gracious.
Annabelle,” the American farce of a party
of hard-up New York aristocrats who take
billets together as servants in a big country
house. Marie made it fairly popular in
Australia, but London has not seen it before.
“Thor”: In calling back to memory the
stage O’Briens of other days, “Norbell” (B.
11/l/’23) neglected to mention “Bridget
O’Brien, Esquire.” Still, the omission may
have been intentional, because she was the
same old Sheridan Widow in an allegedly
new guise. Come to think of it, there was
not so much difference between Sheridan’s
type of extravaganza and most of the musico-
inanities put on to-day, save that Johnnie
was summoned to his fathers before jazz
rioted into the world, along with war and
Spanish influenza.
“Second Murderer”: Wo had the Show
date at Gammon Flat, and old Ned Stormer
made friends with the chap who ran the wine
exhibit, and kept sampling Madeira and port
all afternoon. We really shouldn’t have
allowed him to go on as Archibald Car-
lyle in “East Lynne” that night, but he was
the boss, so. we had to risk it. The pompous
old duffer displayed a totally unexpected vein
of comedy, and guyed everything. On his
very first entrance with Isabel he varied the
usual “Welcome to East Lynne—to your
childhood’s home, Isabel,” by “Well, old girl,
here we are again in Gammon Flat—your
childhood’s home, Lazy Isabel.” A little
later he invited the indignant Lord Mount
Severn to “have a small taste of something.”
But he put the lid on the show in Act 2
when Barbara Hare asked him for £lOO.
The script gives the reply, “Do you want it
now? I have not that sum by me in the
house.” But the sozzled Stormer disgraced
ns all by amending it to, “A hundred quid?
If I had that sum in the house, old dear, I’d
sling acting and buy a pig-farm at Gammon
Flat.”
GRANDFATHER’S ADVICE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“J. C. Williamson, Ltd., has completed arrange-
ments with Dame Nellie Melba for a season of grand
opera in Australia, commencing in about 12 months.”
I mind it, lad, as if ’twas yesterday,
Though I was only twenty-five or so,
That afternoon I heard your grandma say
(The two of us was courtin’ then, you know),
“ Oo is this Melba, can you tell me, pray,
That all the papers praise?—she’s all the go.”
The upshot of it was we both went off
An’ ’eard her sing as Mimi in “Boheme.”
“Not what she was,” observed a white-haired toff
Who sat near us. “This singin’ is a game
At which the old provoke the young to scoff.”
Your grandma cried: “She’ll do me, all the same.”
The year your dad was born we went again:
The opera was “Lohengrin,” I think.
We cheered and clapped with all our might and main
Until a critic muttered, with a wink:
“Age is her trouble, and the vocal strain
Will shortly send her o’er Oblivion’s brink.”
Such senseless sneers both puzzle and annoy.
A thousand times since then they’ve damped my
bliss.
Melba to me has been a perfect joy
For umpteen years, and what I say is this:
“When you grow up you go and ’ear ’er, boy ;
It is a treat that no one ought to miss.”

A NNOUNCEMENT.
Electric Heating and
Cooking Appliances.
The manufacturers of the well-known devices, which for many years
have held the dominating position throughout the world in the electric heating and cooking
appliances market, joined forces some three years ago with other interests in the same
line, viz., General Electric Company (Edison) and Hughes, under the name of the Edison
Electric Appliance Company.
W. G. Watson & Co., Ltd., in recognition of their long association with
JJotfioinL goods as sole distributors in New South Wales and Queensland of the
original Hotpoint Company, were then appointed for a period of years sole distributors in
that territory of the division of the Edison Electric Appliance Company,
and similarly the Australian General Electric Company were appointed sole distributors
of the “EDISON” line.
Recognising the universal popularity of 'liet/ioint devices, the Edison Electric
Appliance Company have now decided to manufacture jfjet/ioint devices only,
and by mutual agreement W. G. Watson & Co., Ltd. (as previous sole distributors of
devices), and Australian General Electric Co., Ltd. (as general agents for
Edison Electric Appliance Co.), now become joint exclusive distributors in New South
Wales and Queensland of these devices.
The Australian General Electric Co., Ltd., retain the sole right of distribution in all
other States of the Commonwealth through its branches or accredited agents.
Issued by authority of the joint distributors for New South Wales and Queensland.

WHEN you have plenty of Hot Water
always “on tap,” things run smoothly

and the kiddies can have a rollicking time in
the bath at any time of the day.
All these and many other benefits that
accompany an uninterrupted supply of
Hot Water are available in the home
equipped with
“IDEAL”
Hot Water Supply
This convenient system gives CONSTANT Hot Water
—day or night—at lowest cost. It fits in with any
kitchen scheme; occupies small space; and is easily
installed or connected to existing pipes. It will burn

vide ample warmth with a fuel
consumption of about 101 b. of coke
per day per room.

Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Howitzer: Too thin for a sketch and too
\oluminous for other use... . 1.A.F.: The problem yarn
that leaves its solution kicking at the end wants
more quality to carry it 8.M.N.Z.: Not enough
interest. .. .R.N.8.: The path “paved with human
fangs” is a new idea E.F.M.: The “Picnic” dies
of emptiness.. . .Amos M.: But was the witness wrong
in accenting the second syllable of “corollary” ?
Modern dictionaries mostly support him, even if
Webster doesn’t. .. .John B.: “Neurasthenia” not
badly done, but it's a fashion that eats too much
space.... Vance M.: You don’t convince us it’s true.
M.C.C.: Poor as the hound of Lazarus Muriel
C.: Commonplace ending on a parody of rhyme
Z.V.W.: Not nearly. If you want verses returned
enclose stamps The Bushman: Very crude
R.G.D.: You left it too rough Chip: The same
beast has been serenaded before; and your verses are
du11... .Henry S.: You had a subject, but you don’t
handle it we 11... .C.R.H.: Not for this market....
Mary P.: Album verse W.A.G.: Weak Helen
M.: The “land of might-have-been” is buried 40ft.
deep under similar verses S.M. (Perth): Uncon-
vincing, and the finish is found frequently in fossil
form.... D.S.M.: Childish. .. .R.8.H.: About half-a-
million people in Australia are asking the same
question.... Shad Dow: Too rugged.... Kat: One
facet of the radiant gem about “The Shanty”:—
To-night they’ll be songs sung out of tune,
Maybe a broken neck,
When the warriors stagger under the light of the
moon
Up the homeward stretch,
It’s a million to a dead sow’s ear
At roll-call on Monday,
They’ll be navvies who will give their lifes for a
beer,
And their all for another Sunday.
....Bessie H.: One slice:—
Not understood—
Then pray for understanding.
First understand youroelf—jr ;t what you are.
When you have made yourself worth understanding
We’ll see that you are not
Not understood.
But why not try it this way ?
Not understood!
Mv dear, your understanding
Of what I understand were little good.
Leave me alone to stand misunderstanding,
Not understanding I am not
Not understood.
. ...P.B. and D.D.H.: Don’t try to use old ideas.
. ...A.E.G.: The rescue yarn grows very familiar,
but it doesn’t improve... .D.M.F.: Not enough in
it... .R.G.C.: The aristocratic magnificence hides
a very poor tale. ...Geo. H. B.: You make it tedious
. ...R.L.J.: Far too many bumps in it....R.H.
(Ballarat): Rather mechanical yarn... .E.M.M.:
They don’t get near... .C.R.A.: Nothing in dt....
Edith J.: Verse that gets too tired to rhyme at
the half-way mark is no good. .. .Maudie: Bad prose
with rhymes at irregular intervals... .L.L.: “Clay
and the Fire” misses by a point or two Gipps-
lander: Goes lame on too many feet.... .Oniega: You
ask if you should throw up your job and take to
writing for a living. Well, if you like going hungry
you might try it....Evo: The merry fay must get
another platform for her song and dance... .L.P.A.:
It may be, as you say, more respectful to address
a goddess as “Thou,” but “Thou who riseth” shows
little respect for grammar. Anyhow, why address
her at all if you have nothing to say? Compton
F.: Interest rather faded.... J.F.N.: And still
Elysium does not mean Heaven. To have placed a
Greek hero in Heaven would have been a bitter pun-
ishment... .E.H.8.: The “Muse” has too many com-
monplace tags.... G.A.L.: The old horse is a bit
stiff in his ideas.... G.R.: The last stanza says all
there is in it:- —
I’m only a white-haired lady,
Alone on a stormy sea,
Awaiting the day when I
Shall see my family.
....Joyce M.: The “strick Catholic” and the general
massacre don’t thrill u5....8.5. “Wheat” goes only
401 b. to the bushel; verse too rugged to carry
“McGill”... .R.E.D.: Doesn’t make a yarn....
Dreamy Dan: We don’t like parodies, and yours
is thin... .Hamilton R.: Avaunt! “Dawn” does not
rhyme with “torn” except to the ears of Cockney
cabmen Bellerive: The tender little item about
the goose moves us deeply:-
Its head a-swaying to and fro,
The creature suffered pain,
The life blood of its body
Rushing to its brain.
Poultry for the table
Were created to destroy ;
But humanity to creatures
I’ve treasured since • a boy.
....Crisp: You’re the sort of wandering writer that
takes a thirsty man round three blocks to get to a
pub across the road. . . .L.L.L.: Oh, throw those
stilts away and walk through your story naturally.
....Sol: Paste accepted pars, on sheet of paper, giv-
ing date and page of each, and forward to accountant
.—F.B.A.: No point there.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
8.H.: Too fashion-platey. .. .L.C.C.: Both have a
curiously familiar look about them. .. .R.M.: Not
up; and why should a man bring- his pint of beer
out on to the pavement to drink it ?... .Barney:
Nothing like him A.E.E.: A long way short
F.P.: Some promise, but treatment too stiff yet....
A.E.K.: Flapper with curvature of the spine can’t
get past... .M.A.S.: Apologies accepted—but not the
sketch.... G.V.C.: You’ve a good way to go yet....
A.E.: Neither drawing nor gag passes muster....
H.W.: That joke was made when the first pair of
pants began to go W.A.H.: Out R.R.: A
glint of promise, but drawing faulty. .. . Barnes:
Pointless... .R.G.C.: No good. .. .C.McL.: Sorry, but
you can not draw T.H.: As usual.
After au unusual batch of accidents in
Adelaide the City Council has awakened to
the astounding fact that a motor-driving
license is issued, under S.A. law, to anybody
who pays for one, without any driving test.
Now the Council is asking the Government
to alter the law in the direction of common-
sense.
At a send-off in a N.S.W. township a set
of quadrilles was danced by eight local
pleasure-seekers whose average age was 73.
The old people wanted to show the flighty
flappers and mercurial knuts how decorously
they danced in their young days, when the
gents.’ whiskers were black and the ladies’
molars all their own.

“Pantagruel”: Queensland has seen some
big sales of land and stock recently. Wilson
and McDual’s Calliungal station (C.Q.) has
passed to a group of Sydney business men,
who intend subdividing the property into
cotton and mixed grazing farms; £55,000
was the purchase price. And 26,000 wethers,
four months from shears, were sold off
Afton Downs for 265. per head ; both num-
ber and price are records for that part of
Queensland.

“George Rich”: In the open season
(October and November) for snaring opos-
sums in Westralia. the number of skins
stamped for royalty was 204,474. The
Government’s share in the spoil, at Is. 6d.
a pelt, amounted to £15,272. Half the pelts
passed in were probably from ’possums
trapped before the season was declared
open; and unless the State wakes up and
insists on a real close season, little ’poss
will soon be a very rare critter in Groper-
dom. It will take fully three years for the
family to recover from the last two hunting
campaigns.

“Glen Y.”: If I had a low standard of
commercial morality and wished to make a
bit on the side, I should try for a job in a
Government department where horse-feed is
handled and chaff is bought by the ton, to be
retailed by the bag and not by weight. There
are such jobs. And don’t tell me, with experi-
perience as a purchaser, that somebody doesn’t
make a nice picking. Consider chaff and its
bagging—screw-bagging puts up to 1401 b. in
a bag, a dumper perhaps 1001 b., and hand-
bagging say 801 b. at most. If the Gov-
ernment buys screw-bagged chaff by weight,
and its employees re-bag it by hand, to sell
at a flat rate of so much per bag, is there
anything to stop the on-the-sider from put-
ting by a regular percentage of bags to sell
on his own account to casual buyers? The
extremely remote chance of such a buyer
being a Government detective is all that
stands between the pilferer and safety. Ex-
perience of chaff-buying, anyway, teaches the
horse-owner that he never meets in private
commerce the emaciated bags which the
State offers its customers.

“Wilson Hill” (California) : Let me assist
“Skyrider” (B. 20/7/’22) and “Kirk” (B.
24/8/’22) to get straight on .the walnut-
growing proposition. Southern California,
where the production of walnuts is most
highly developed and specialised, is now har-
vesting a 40,006-ton crop. In Orange
County’s 16,500 acres there is an average re-
turn of 651 b. to 701 b. per tree. The best
orchards are planted 60ft. x 60ft., or 11 or
12 trees per acre. Payable returns begin
about the eighth year; trees from 12 years
upwards are called full-bearing, and some of
these produce as high as 3001 b. of nuts in a
season. Budded walnuts command two to
four cents a pound premium. This year they
give a return of 22 cents a pound. Pickers,
mostly Mexican families, get 70 cents a
hundred pounds, hulled. After eight to ten
days’ sun-drying, the nuts are sorted, graded
and bleached in an electric chloride-of-lime
bath before marketing. The foggy, moist
coastal areas are the best for production.

“Stony” on what may happen to rabbits:
I have it from Jim, who traps rabbits, and
Jimmo, who sells them off the barrow, that strange
things happen in the marts of trade when the
inspector is in the office having a nip with some-
bod}'. The crates are coming in Jby the gross, and
being sorted out in the yard. By-and-bye the
inspector appears, asks how may crates have been
condemned, is informed and retires again. Enter
a barrowman. “Any tcr-day?” he asks. “Yes,”
says somebody. “How much ?” asks Jimmo.
“Tuppence-ha’penny a pair,” somebody answers.
“Righto,” says Jimmo, and takes away a load of
perfectly good “condemned” rabbits, having paid
cash for them. Later, “Whose rabbits was those
condemned ones?” asks somebody. “Aw, Brown’s,
of Bungwangle, they was.” So Brown, of Bung-
wangle, is docked for so many crates of rabbits,
and curses the muggy weather when his cheque
arrives. That’s all —only it would be a fair
thing for the Government to appoint inspectors who
would ascertain just how the condemned-crate
figures compare with those of rabbits received at
the tip.
* » * *
A scheme to hasten the Millennium:—
One H. Valder, a businessman of Hamilton (M.L.),
has published a pamphlet to settle the labor
difficulty, and Prime Minister Bill Massey has
given it his blessing. Valder proposes the issue
of labor shares, and the payment of bank interest
on capital plus a “risk rate” (in his examples
he makes this 2 or 3 p.c.), all the rest of the
profits, after providing for reserves (which are to
belong to the employees), being cut up among the
workers (including managers). It looks simple,
but there are a few lions in the path. (1) Who is
going to fix the “risk rate” ? And is it going to
be fixed only with regard to the risks of the particu-
lar business to which it applies? If so, how is the
man who puts money into (say) 20 mine-prospecting
ventures going to do it if only one of them turns
out a success ? How is the farmer who has two
unprofitable years out of three going to manage? (2)
How is the young, struggling, and for the time
being unprofitable manufacturing or other business
going to get labor in competition with the old
established and prosperous concern, the bulk of whose
profits go to the workers? (3) How is the small
business to grow into a big one if the surplus
profits are divided instead of being left in the
business? (4) How are profits to be divided in cash,
when, as is often the case, the bulk of them are
in stocks, book-debts, etc. ? (5) When, as is usually
the case, the contributors of capital are also direc-
tors or managers, who is going to fix their salaries,
and therefore their proportion of the labor dividend ?
Mr, Valder says there are only two factors in
industry—labor and capital. That is true, but there
is almost as wide a gulf between the director
(who provides labor) and the manual worker as
there is between the laborer and the capitalist;
and the division of the surplus between the former
is going to be just as difficult as the division be-
tween the latter. In fact, it is more than half
the real trouble now, for what the boss takes he
mostly thinks he is entitled to, not because of the
money he has invested, but because of the ability
he puts into the business.


Oil once a month
1
the
isren
Engine
the rest
HAVE we put it plainly enough? Do you realise
that we really mean “Oil once a month”—
and not as often as that, unless you are using
the Engine all day and every day! Technically speak-
ing this unique Lister feature is known as “Automatic
Lubrication,” but we want to put it in the simplest
way we can, because once you understand this point
you will see how far the Lister Engine is ahead of
all others.
Just think! You wouldn’t like to have to oil
your motor-car engine every time you used it, would
you? Then, why do it with a farm engine? With
the Lister there are no oil holes, no lubricators, no
grease cups to look after. You can’t forget to
lubricate any part and you can’t waste oil.
AND THE LISTER IS DUST-PROOF! That
means that even when you are chaffcutting in
the shed or using your engine out of doors
during a dry spell in summer, when the least puff of
wind raises clouds of dust, every moving part of your
Lister Engine is absolutely protected against that
greatest enemy of long life in machinery—dust and
grit. Compare this with the ordinary open-crankcase
engine! Is it any wonder that Lister Engines are
handed down from father to son? Is it any wonder
that Listers, even after 4 and 5 years’ use, bring
almost the price of a new one? Anyone who has
seen one working knows that the Lister costs nothing
in lost time or repair bills. It’s the real trouble-proof
farm engine.
There are other features in the Lister just as valuable; let us tell you about them by letter.

From the Bundaberg (Q.) Mail
(20/l/’23) :
POLICE COURT.
At the police court yesterday a first offender
charged with drunkenness was admonished and
destroyed.
And this in the State that has abolished
capital punishment for murder !
During the last year or so all sorts of
things with the boot in them have happened
to Buckley, ex-M.L.A. for Sydney. He was
fired out of the Australian Railway Union
(and his office in it), he lost his seat in
Parliament owing to McGirr butting into the
selection ballot, and in two other selection
ballots he was turned down. Now the union
has admitted him again, but only after a
very strenuous battle.
Howard Tolley, the new sec to the Ilen-
mark (S.A.) Irrigation Trust, which uses
the Murray to help to turn bush into
orchard, has had similar experience at Mil-
dura, a bit higher on the river, and in Cali-
fornia ; and latterly he has been senior field-
officer of the N.S.W. Irrigation Commission.
Tolley went into the war a private, and
came out a major with the D.S.O. and sun-
dry “mentions.” The new billet is worth
£6OO a year, plus certain allowances.
The N.S.W. Government has promised
veterinary surgeons that it will bring down
a bill at an early date providing for the
registration of vets., a measure that has
long been demanded by capable practitioners
and representative bodies. The profession
for many years past has been the happy
hunting-ground of quacks. If Hayseed’s stock
are saved from the worse than useless minis-
trations of these pill-and r poultice gentry,
Hayseed in particular, and the country in
general, will score.
There was woe among the Vic. Tories and
Methodies over the defeat at the polls of
George Swinburne by printer Ted Findley.
In 10 years the public had forgotten all
about Swinburne’s services as Minister for
Water Supply and Agriculture and as
founder and chief financial supporter of the
Eastern Suburbs Tech. School, Glenferrie.
If Swinburne had emphasised Liberalism
more and Nationalism and Hughesisin less
he might have topped the poll. The State
is now trying to get him back as an Elec-
tricity Commissioner.
“W.H.K.”: “Red Ilussar” (B. 4/l/’23)
is a long way over the mark when he says
that the Military Police were “admittedly
the dregs of the A.1.F.” Candidates for the
Corps of Military Police were required to
be men of good physique, fair education
and good character. If at any time an M.P.
was found guilty of misconduct he was
returned to his unit at once. And in com-
mon fairness it should be added that a large
percentage of the men had good records of
service on Gallipoli and elsewhere, and that
many had been wounded, some more than
once.
Will Hope, the Maoriland cartoonist, has
begun to create a stir in London. He can
never resist a joke. One of his best efforts
was to introduce the Futurist cartoon that
had a boom for a few months. He would
draw a straight line, put in a circle or
something, and call it “Ireland.” People
wondered at its deep symbolism; and it was
months before the editor of a big daily dis-
covered the joke. Another effort was to
lead a procession of Boy Scouts, with drums
and trumpets, through the editorial rooms
of a celebrated London daily. These pranks
at last drove him to the refuge of a Social-
ist paper; but Will Hope is a whimsical
artist, and will do important work when he
gets a chance.
“Mr. Ocky”: Though Frank Tate, Vic.
Director of Education, always furiously
denied that he was going to be made a
knight, there was much surprise when he
wasn’t. His anger on the subject recalled
that of George Reid at Geelong the last
time he was in Australia. W. T. Ivendell,
then M.11.R. for Corio, in, a too-flattering
speech, said that his Majesty was pretty
sure to make the globular High Commis-
sioner a baron. Poor Ivendell had hardly got
the remark out when there was a howl of rage
from the big man. Before the assembled
heads he described the unhappy Ivendell as
an amazing sort of ass, and almost threat-
ened to send for the police. The gathering
broke up in disorder, and Reid was still
fuming when they helped him to his carriage.
Apart from naming itself after him the
Speck has done nothing to commemorate Abel
Janszoon Tasman, who discovered the island
in 1642. Now it is proposed to erect some
sor; of monument on the spot where Tas-
man landed, if only a committee can agree
where that is. Anyone who knows the
country will probably fall in with the view
that the place where Tasman himself, as
recorded in his log, landed and searched in
vain for water was at the southern end of
the Two-Mile Beach on Forestier’s Pen-
insula. But the place where the ship’s car-
penter, Jacobzoon, swam ashore and hoisted
the Dutch flag was the little cove farther
north on the same coast, now called Prince
of Wales' Bay on the maps and known
locally as Watson’s, after an old-time
whaler. The day before that a boat’s crew
had gone inside Blackman’s Bay (which is
no doubt what Tasman named Frederick
Henry Bay), but Tasman was not with
them.
On a corpse-like silence; —
Not quite two years ago word came over the
cable that a couple of railwaymen had been shot
in a confused melee at Mallow, Ireland. Without
waiting to learn particulars, the Vic. Railway Union
announced through its annual conference, then
effervescing, that the victims had been
“murdered by the hired assassins of the British
Government,” and that the conference “entered a
vigorous protest against the inhuman practices f exist-
ing in Ireland.” For months past the followers
of De Valera have been waging a campaign of
terrorism against the Irish railwaymen, but for
whom whole towns would starve. Trains have
been fired on, bridges and sections of track blown
up, and captured locomotives sent roaring through
the night to pile up in station-yards or convey loyal
crews to Kingdom Come. These measures failing,
two engine-drivers were bulleted last week in a
Tralee street. The National Union of Irish Railway-
men, “in the name of all railwaymen, and of the
grief-stricken widows and orphans,” has denounced
the “awful deed.” But thus far the Vie. Railway
Union, so voluble after the Mallow business when
the “oppressor” was alleged to be at fault, is as
dumb as the mummy of Tutankhamen.

PLUME SPIRIT
Easy starting, sweet running, more miles.
(Extra Quality)
Plume puts an end to fuel troubles.
With Plume you can be sure of perfect com-
bustion, thus avoiding the serious trouble
caused by inferior fuel diluting and ruining
the lubricating oil in the crank case.
The secret of freedom from fuel troubles is
the use of a volatile petrol such as Plume
Motor Spirit. Every drop of Plume vaporises
and is put to work, returning full power and
mileage. BE SURE IT IS PLUME.
We also market Mercury brand, which is

Men! Try a Rexona Shave.
You’ll Enjoy It.
In half-a-minute Rexona Shaving Soap softens the beard,
and the lather will remain on the face with all its softness for
twelve minutes, but Rexona shavers do not require this, for
Rexona Shaving Soap makes the beard so soft that a Rexona
shave really takes not more than two minutes.
A Rexona shave is a luxuriant yet an economical shave, for
the lather is over 1 5 0 times as great as the Soap used, and a 1/6
triangular stick is sufficient to last the average man at least 150
shaves, which makes over eight shaves for a penny. Then, too,
consider how much easier Rexona Shaving Soap makes the beard
on the razor, and how soft, smooth and antiseptic it leaves the
skin, and protects it from all weather conditions.
Being an antiseptic Medicated Soap, it has a tendency to
quickly heal any cut you may have the misfortune to get, and if
troubled with pimples or blotches of any kind, will daily tend
to improve them.
Men! Try Rexona Shaving Soap,
the new triangular stick—we can promise
you a new satisfaction.

My Friend in the Forest.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I WALK at evening in the quiet wood,
And one I love comes through the
aisles to me,
Advancing swift and glad, as though to meet
A long-loved friend. And so together we
Pace the green glades, and all the world
seems good.
I know his face, though it is veiled from me,
Is beautiful as Life and proud and sad
And full of yearning. And I feel his smile
Is wonderful past words —so SAveet and
glad—
My heart sings in such gracious company.
Row many years have passed since first we
met V
A child, I reached for berries on the brink
Of a swift river, so I slipped and fell
Into the flood, to struggle, sink and sink —
The fear of deep dark water haunts me yet.
I saw through closed lids the light of day,
And felt strong arms relax. My fingers
knew
And grasped the daisies on the bank. My
eyes
Opened a moment on his face, which grew
All misty ere it vanished quite aAvay.
Since, lie has shown me where the fairies
pHy, , ,
Written my name upon the gleaming sand,
Has held me safe upon the cliff’s sheer edge,
Walked with me in the realms of wonder-
land.
And guided me where hidden pitfalls lay.
Yet never will he leave the forest shade,
Never reveal his name, his face unveil.
“Some day,” he says, “some day”—and I’m
content.
He is my friend, to never tire or fail,
Though other loves may die and friendships
fade.
Some day he’ll enter at the garden-door,
And through the languid roses quietly glide
And bend and kiss me. I shall see bis face
And take his offered hand, and by his side
Go forth and leave my house for evermore.

When the Bullocks Came to
Macquarie-street.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE had worked since childhood on one
of the big stations near Warialda.
He had broken horses, sheared,
mended fences, trapped rabbits and done the
hundred and one things a man is expected
to do in the Backblocks. When he was 30
Mary Moran came to the station as cook to
the homestead. She was just plain Mary,
and no more like the Madonna or Mary
Pickford or Mary Miles Minter than chalk
is like cheese. She Avas tall, thin, freckled-
faced and grey-eyed. No one would have
looked twice at Mary Moran. But her voice
was the most beautiful thing in the world.
She spoke with the softest of soft Irish
accents, and she had the most delicious way
of laughing down in the throat like some
feathered thing in the bush about to begin
an intoxicating love-song to its bride in the
tree-top nest. And she could sing. Particu-
larly when she was in the dairy making the
butter into pats and rolls and scouring the
cans, Mary Moran would lift her voice to
the quiet hills and sing—sing like the angels
of Heaven sing to little children when all
is still at evening and the Virgin steps with
white feet upon the crescent moon.
Michael (of course his name was Michael ;
no other man with any other name would
have thought of things like that) took the
silent shy things of his heart out and pre-
sented them to Mary Moran one evening as
they sat by the creek at the side of the wool-
shed. Michael was rather glad that the frogs
made the noise they did and that the crickets
were more than usually eloquent, because it
silenced the thumping of his heart.
Mary was perfectly natural with him, and
told the good man, to his amazement, that
she loved him with all her soul and would
never dream of marrying anyone else.
For the moment, victory having been so
easily won, Michael hardly knew what to do
with his gift; but Mary Moran showed him
the place her head would rest on most com-
fortably, and cuddled into her breast the
hands that were scarred and brown and had
never seen a manicurist in their lives.
It was very strange that the three won-
ders should have happened on the same day.
Michael reflected on them as he lay later on
in his stretcher in his hut. First, he had
that morning gone up with the fumigating
cart to the water paddock, where the rabbits
had been laughing over the newspaper stories
about birth control. Curiosity having over-
come him, he had operated upon several suf-
focated mothers, and had returned to the
homestead with the remarkable news that
he had found 15 in one litter. The wires
had buzzed all round the place, and the boss
had spoken more sentences in one hour than
he had during the past three years, the bush
somehow tying up a man’s tongue. Then
the boundary-rider had told him that the
bullock-driver was going to sell the team, and
that there was a chance if he wanted it of
getting the beasts and the business cheap.
And then Mary Moran had told him, Avith
her beautiful voice, that he was the most
wonderful man in the Avorld, and had never
once remarked about his broken nose or his
rough manner.
He sighed luxuriously, and within him his
great heart swelled up and shouted exult-
antly.
With the bit of money he had saA T ed,
Michael paid down so much on account and
bought the team of bullocks and the waggon,
and arranged Avith the boss and the stores
that he should carry on. And Mary Moran
sewed and smiled and laid by in a cardboard
box (in which were bags of verbena) half
a dozen of each, made out of muslin and fine
calico trimmed with her own dainty embroi-
dery.
Michael owned actually five animals and
the waggon noAv, and was doing well. Mary
had named the bullocks, and she loved them
dearly. To her they represented a home
of her own, Michael coming in, and perhaps,
later, some little feet running around the
house, arid little voices shouting with
laughter. There were eight bullocks in all,
and the couple had decided not to marry
until the whole lot had been paid for.
Acushla, Robert Emmet, Shamrock, Ireland,
Thomas Moore, Killarney, Blarney Boy,
and Mavourneen, plodding stolidly up and
down the track across the black-soil plains,
little guessed what they stood for in the
lives of two people.
It was 18 months before the bills were
all clear, and then Mary and Michael were
wedded. They took a little place near the
station where Michael had lived all his life,
and the boss did it up for them so beautifully
as a wedding present that Mary cried over
it and him, and told him how wonderful he
was, too. The boss looked at Mary and said
he was very glad to have done anything to
make her happy. She had made the best
pies he had ever tasted in his life, and
Michael and he had rabbited together as
boys, fought each other, and lain breath-
lessly fishing in the rivers. He was glad,
very glad, he said; and all the way down
the road as he walked his horse home he
thought of the face of Mary and marvelled
at the thing men call love which had never
come into his life, and had never made him
want to paint slabs of timber red, and
thatched roofs green, and all to see a
woman’s eyes glow and a woman’s mouth
quiver with happiness.
Mary and Michael lived together for three
years and were happy. Only one little
cloud drifted persistently across their horizon
and brought little showers of tears with it.
The little feet and the little voices did not
come. Mary thought about it and brooded
on it badly when Michael was away with
the team. Michael thought about it when
lie was driving along the roads smoking his
pipe and wondering what he could do to
put back the glow into Mary’s eyes. And
he thought about it a lot when Mary would
press her head into his shoulder at night
and quietly weep herself to sleep. But they
were happy—happy even though they had
not managed to save any money, the seasons
not being good. And even when they are
good a bullock team is not a business w r hich
makes fortunes in a day.
The accident happened one evening about
dusk, when Mary, hearing the team returning,
ran out to the gate and in her hurry tripped
and fell over a stump, hitting both breasts
on the stony ground. It does not take long
for the fear of cancer to spread in a woman’s
mind when hideous aching pains begin,
accompanied by two little hard lumps the
size of small eggs. Michael had to be told
eventually, and it was decided that Mary
must go down to see a Macquarie-street
specialist, who would make it all right.
Besides, it mightn’t be that at all; and
Michael would pat her head and try not
to see the look in the eyes that were up-
turned to his. But as the days wore on
Mary forgot how to sing, and there was
none at the gate to meet the bullock team
returning. Acushla, Robert Emmet, Sham-
rock and their brethren brooded long and
silently over this.
It costs a great deal of money to go to
Sydney and stay in a boarding-house and
consult specialists, and Michael and Mary
realised it. They talked it over and Mary
said that perhaps she needn’t go, and they
would try herbal cures and remedies she
had read of in the papers. So she pre-
vailed for a little time, and they both com-
forted themselves in the vain hope that
somehow each was hiding from the other the
knowledge that the knife was the only solu-
tion of the tragedy. Mary spent all the
money she had saved out of the housekeep-
ing upon all sorts of messes which, accord-
ing to the testimonials of gratified patients,
had cured them completely. But they didn’t
cure Mary, and at last she had to tell
Michael that she must go.
So Michael sold Acushla, and Mary
bought a ticket to Sydney.
When she had accommodated hersejf com-
fortably in a boarding-house, she began the
tour of Macquarie-street. The first specialist
told her in a few moments what would have
to be done, and he told her without any
coverings-up. As a matter of fact, he
wanted to get away to golf and it was late.
Mary paid him two guineas and said she
wouid call again. Of course she knew all
the time that she must have an operation,
but perhaps she might strike some doctor
who could cure her without. When
she wrote to Michael that night she refrained
from telling him what the specialist had
said, and Michael wired back that she was
to do everything she could and not mind the
expense—-the. money would be got somehow.
With a face still eager with hope,
Mary entered. Macquarie-street again. It
was while waiting her turn in a room ele-
gant and spacious, where the latest periodi-
cals were upon a Queen Anne table, and the
curtains were of deep blue velvet, that Mary
made the acquaintance of a woman who
listened earnestly to her troubles and then
advised her to go to a “humane physician”
who didn’t believe in operations, and yet
had cured hundreds of cancer cases.
Mary went away with a heart full of
thankfulness, and found the famous person.
Yes, he could do it. He examined Mary
and asked her many questions and put it ail
down in a book long before he looked at the
angry breasts. Mary was quivering with
excitement. His face lengthened. He was
afraid it was worse than he thought. It
might be managed—his voice was doubtful.
Yes, he would do his best, but Mary must
be prepared to face expenses and per-
haps—
Mary was exultant. She would face any-
thing rather than the knife.
She wrote to Michael and told him her
hopes. This man without any letters or
anything had said there was a chance.
Surely, surely it might be all right. But
how could they get the money for lotions
and medicines and board and treatments?
And up in the country where the heat was
terrific and flies were eating the skin off
his body, where cattle were dying of thirst
and the grass was yellow ash, Michael faced
his problem.
So Robert Emmet. Shamrock, Ireland and
Thomas Moore paid the price and walked
into dispensing-rooms, consulting-rooms and

Is a dull, constant backache spoiling your life? Do sharp
pains stab you at every sudden move? Are you so tired
and down-hearted it seems you just can’t keep going?
Don’t be discouraged! You wouldn’t feel so badly
without a cause; and more than likely the cause is weak
kidneys. Not any organic kidney trouble, perhaps, but
a slowing-up of the kidneys and the resulting accumula-
tion of poisons that well kidneys would have filtered off.
Is it any wonder then, you feel so run-down, nervous and
depressed? That you are subject to frequent headaches,
dizzy spells and annoying bladder irregularities? Then,
why not give the weakened kidneys the help they need?
Why wait for some serious kidney trouble? Use Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills. Doan’s have helped thousands.
They should help you. Ask your neighbor I
EXPERIENCES OF SYDNEY PEOPLE
Mrs. .T. Maxwell, 17 Hansard Street, Waterloo, Sydney, says:—“lt
gives me great pleasure to say a few words in favor of Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills, this remedy having completely cured me of a bad attack of
kidney disorder some two years ago. I suffered dreadfully for some time,
and was often so bad with backache that I was obliged to lie up. I could
get nothing to give me ease from the constant pain, day or night, and it
was fast taking all, the life and energy, out of me. The kidney secretions
were affected, being thick and cloudy, with a red 'sediment, and there was
pufliness under the eyes, this, I knew, being a sign of dropsy. Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills acted splendidly, giving me relief in a few days, and,
as I continued taking the pills my health rapidly improved, three bottles
making a perfect cure.”
Six years later Mrs. Maxwell confirms her previous statement, and
says“l have had no return of kidney trouble since Doan’s Pills cured
me eight years ago. I have great faith in this medicine, and always keep
a bottle in the house.”
Mr. Henry Francis, 2 Oxford Street, Burwood, Sydney, says:—
“Eighteen months ago I commenced to feel off color. A slight scalding
of the secretions began and gradually grew worse until they were intensely
painful, and I could not retain them. A pain then crept up my back and I
suffered torture. I went into the hospital and was treated there, for nine
weeks, and although I came out a little relieved I was still in pain, and a
week later was as bad as when I went in. By accident I came across a
pamphlet about Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and after reading it I
resolved to give this remedy a trial, so sent for some at once. The first
bottle did not seem to do me much good, but I persevered, and while taking
the second bottle I got a little ease, and four bottles completely cured me.
Twenty years later, Mrs. Francis says:—“My husband has great
faith in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and always keeps them by him.
This medicine cured him many years ago, and it always acts beneficially
whenever he has occasion to take it.”

a physician’s home to make Mary well,
while Ivillarney, Blarney Boy and Mavour-
neen looked at each other silently and brooded
with Michael.
But Mary did not get well. The doctor
was very sorry, and he did all he could ; but,
of course, he had told Mary in the first
place. And Mary, with wet hands and an
empty purse, walked out of his room to write
tile inevitable to Michael.
Two days later she went to a doctor who
did believe in operations—believed very
thoroughly in them, as his bank-book could
testify.
So Mary went into the public hospital
and was prepared for her operation. And
Michael in the country buried his face in
his hands and waited.
It was not the fault of the great surgeon
that Mary’s heart was not as strong as it
might have been. It was not his fault,
either, that she had “tinkered about with
some fool of a quack” while the cancers
spread. So the bandaging-up was done, and
Mary was wheeled back to her room....and
the nurse wrote to Michael and told him
he had better come down.
Killarney paid the railway fare.
There was nothing so beautiful as Mary
lying dead on her narrow bed. And it
seemed so terrible that, after all the doc-
tors had been able to do with their clever-
ness, and the clean, wonderful hpspital,
that Mary should have died. Michael was
too pitifully stunned to weep—too agonised
to understand anything save that Mary was
gone from him for ever and ever. Yes, he
understood he must pay the fees just the
same. Yes, and the man who had given the
anaesthetic.... yes, it was all right; he
would do it all, all.
Blindly he got home. Then it was the
turn of Blarney Boy to do his bit for Mary.
They buried Mary in a pine box in the
potter’s field, out near a tall tree where a
little bird sang very sweetly all the day. And
Michael and Mavourneen were left. There
were so many graves in the potter’s field
that Michael became fearful Mary’s would
not be minded, with himself so far away.
So Mavourneen, the last of the bullocks, was
sold. His was the privilege ‘of covering
Mary with a slab of stone. His was the
honor of planting a trail of ivy over the cold-
ness of it.
The sun shone warmly down. It thrilled
the heart of the ivy so that it twined lov-
ingly around the sacred name of Mary. It
brought gladness to the eye of the little bird
who sang in the tree-top nest. But far up
in the country, where the cattle dropped
from thirst and the crops shivered silently,
where the sheep panted and the horses died
like flies, where strong men and worn
women faced the great conflict of the battle
of primitive life, and where one lmmble
house raised its hands bravely to the quiet
hills, it broke the heart of Michael.
In the evening the smoke rose from the
little house and a man leant against a door-
way watching a star. Somewhere there in
the haze of the great understanding Mary
was watching and believing. Michael
squared his shoulders and went indoors,
while God sent his beloved darkness upon
tie world to close the eyes of tired men.
CORALIE STANLEY McKELLAR.
Irish Cats.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE must have been fond of cats at
one time. The family legend goes
that in my great-grandmother’s
house in Ireland there were “upstair” cats
and “downstair” cats, with a special Hiber-
nian servant-girl to look after them. Every
member of the household wore his or her
special cat under the chair at meals, so that
a visiting small boy, noting the bit of
ceremony and feeling his catless state
acutely, cried out in a loud voice, “Someone
put a cat under my chair!” And a cat was
promptly put, for there were always cats to
spare in that quaint old Irish household.
My great-grandmother was beloved by her
family, and at night, when she was comb-
ing lier luxuriant hair in her bedroom, the
various members would wander along tor a
last gossip over the events of the day, each
gossiper with his or her cat tucked under his
(or her) arm. History doesn’t record how
or if all the cats were kept clean in that
day of few disinfectants; nor does it describe
how the “upstair” cats were prevented from
becoming "downstair” cats, nor define in
good railway language what constituted an
“up” cat and what a “down.”'
I wonder if the meowing ghosts of all the
useless brutes I have put out of the world
worry the shade of the old lady—-my blood
relation whom I never knew and who to me
is a legendary Celtic figure placidly brush-
ing her hair in the midst of a thicket of
tails ! For, without ever endeavoring to be
a cat-owner, I have been forced to become
both that and a cat-murderer, time after
time. I still remember with shudders the
bagged cat that was thrown by night from a
high river bridge at Studley Park, Mel-
bourne, and hit an eel-fishing party on the
bank, necessitating a long run through dark
streets. Then there was the kitten blind of
one eye that I drowned early one breathless
summer morning at Middle Park without
benefit of brick or bag (both those accesso-
ries were unobtainable, and the tide was
further out than I ever saw it before). I
stood on the marge of that silken sea, and,
as gently as I could, cast the kitten into it
again and again, until the unfortunate thing
turned its furry back on me in disgust and
started to swim across the bay to Williams-
town, thereby putting me out of my agony.
If I know anything of cats, it reached there
in good order and condition, recovered the
sight of its eye and lived to a good old age.
I managed to dodge actual cat-ownership
until some years after marriage. Then some
evil-disposed neighbors with a superfluous
kitten to get rid of gave it to my small son,
and the curse was upon me again. Whiff
(the kid with rare discernment christened
the brute that) grew up rapidly and was the
pampered loafer and fish-and-bone pensioner
of the family until it caught a bad cold and
became the Cough at the Back Door, and
the Sneeze on the Roof, also the Choking
Sound under the House.
At this stage a woman friend of my wife’s
told her cats were the champion disease-
carriers of the world, and to get rid of it
at once, otherwise the children would catch
whatever it had, and die. ,
“Get rid of that brute!” commanded the
scared mother, and I started to miseiably
consider the position. Had I been calm, 1
should have gone to work to gain Whitts
confidence with a view to murder; but 1
felt so mad at being forced to take up the
murderer’s burden once more that I began
to throw loose timber at the brute whenever
I sighted it. So Whiff mostly coughed at
me from behind the chimney, and the small
black cat he had lately married and passed
his ailment to sneezed discreetly behind the
woodshed, while the wall-eyed sinister
stranger who was their most consistent visi-
tor hiccuped in the middle distance.
“Please get rid of that brute!” repeated
the lady of the house, when I had been pelt-
ing and cursing Whiff, his wife and stinking
friend for a useless fortnight—and inciden-
tally missing many good chances of braining
them all.
In desperation I rang up a friend whose
house is full of firearms. He had once
owned a pea-rifle, and I told his wife over
the wire that I wanted it urgently. She
replied that her husband had gone out of
town with most of his artillery, and had
given the pea-rifle away some time before.
After that I mooned about for a day or so
until I bumped against the chemist at an
election meeting.
“Here,” I said, gripping him by the arm
and ignoring the-speaker’s heroics, “what’s
good for cats —I mean what’s bad for them?
I’ve got three brutes I want to get rid of.”
“Quite simple,” said he airily ; “a bit of
fish and some strychnine will fix them up.
Come into the shop next time you’re pass-
ing.”
“Thanks,” I replied, but I didn’t feel as
grateful as I might have done. Perhaps
some strain of my cat-loving ancestress per-
sists in me. However, I cheered up the wife
on my return by telling her that “fish
and strychnine” was the password into the
other world for cats. Just then the three
cats sneezed all together under the kitchen.
And, after all, it was the wife who actu-
ally bought the fish and poison and spread
the banquet of death in the back yard. I
came home one evening while the whole
question was still being debated in the Par-
liament of my mind, to find that my partner
had rushed a bill through both Houses and
completed the awful business. I was given
the news by a collapsed murderess, whc
swore she would never do anything of the
kind again. Whiff’s wife had arrived first
and gorged two whole fish-heads before
Whiff and the sinister friend clawed over the
fence for their share. Pretty soon there
were three cats twitching and foaming at the
whiskers, and Mrs. Whiff had retired to die
under the house while the other two, with
gentlemanly consideration, had gone down
the street a little and leaped convulsively
over neighbors’ front fences, evidently with
the idea of decorating the front lawns with
their remains.
“Do you think I ought to write a little
note to Mrs. Jobkins and Mrs. Petunia, ex-
plaining and apologising?” appealed Mrs.
Borgia.
“Not on your life!” I commanded. “A
poisoned cat is the sort of thing you can’t
write polite notes about. Let them lie, and
say nothing.” , .
Then she rose and put the lighted hurri-
cane lantern into my hand. ‘‘Very well,
Please go and get out Mrs. Whiff's body;
we can’t let it stay under the house.”
I applied for a stay of proceedings until 1
had changed into old clothes; and it was
just as well I did, for I had to creep and
crawl on my chest through dust and rubbish
before 1 I found Mrs. Whiff lying, stiff as a
board, within easy raking distance of the
back door. I was so delighted at exerting
myself unnecessarily that I pitchforked the
remains out somewhat roughly and nearly
hit my wife in the eye with them.
When I had crawled out again backwards,
I was too hot and infuriated to set to and
bury Mrs. Whiff at once. Instead 1 went
away to. cool off, and, while doing so, it
struck me that to a man with a score to
work off a dead cat was an asset not to
be buried in the back garden at dead of
night. Just down the street was the villa
of Myth, the careless suburbanite who had
handed our household the germ of chicken-
pox, and thereby fairly earned something
like Mrs.. Whiff. So I hand-printed a card
‘‘A Present from a Friend,” tied it to Mrs.
Whiff’s stiff fail with a scrap of ribbon, and,
stepping lightly down the street, opened the
Myths’ front gate and aimed the gift of
hate at the closed front door. It landed
with a thud, and I heard someone hurrying
to answer the knock of the dead as I
sauntered round the corner.
“Did you bury Mrs. Whiff?” asked the
wife as I came in.
“I duly disposed of the body,” I answered,
and she was so sick of the cat problem that
she let it go at that.
We were settling down for an evening read
when there was a sound---two sounds —at
the front door.
“Don’t tell me ——!” cried my harassed
and rather hysterical partner, dropping her
novel.
I crept to the front door and opened it
cautiously. Side by side on the mat sat
Whiff and the sinister friend, as though they
had called to demand an explanation and
apology. Whiff sneezed at me twice and
the sinister friend did three hiccups before 1
went quite mad and kicked out with both
feet. They turned and fled, sneezing and
hiccupping, under the house, which seems to
have been~ specially constructed for a cat
and fowl sanctuary.
Now as the nights drag away in a haze
of argument and recrimination, the two cats
that should be dead insult us by sneezing
and hiccupping together under the house
where only a baboon could reach them. I
try to explain how strychnine is a tonic as
well as a poison and is frequently used to
buck up the system. To all suggestions that
I buy another sixpennyworth of the tonic and
doctor some more fish-heads I return various
cowardly and evasive answers. For one
thing I hate crawling about on my stomach
in the dust looking for dead cats; and for
another something in my make-up revolts at
the idea of deliberate and cold-blooded cat-
murder. I’m not the great-grandson of that
Celtic cat-lover for nothing.
