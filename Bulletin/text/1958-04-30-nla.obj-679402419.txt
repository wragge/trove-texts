THE ENTHUSIASTIC IMMIGRANT
Australia must seldom have had so
enthusiastic an immigrant as Sydney
Hart, who may be remembered as the
author of “Discharged Dead,” a book
about his war-time experiences as a
stoker in submarines, and who is now
the author of Pommie Migrant
(Odhams).
No sooner had he arrived in Aus-
tralia in 1949 than, scorning a surface
job which was also offering but the pay
for which was less than he had been
receiving in Glasgow, he plunged down
a coalmine at Coalcliffe, N. S. Wales
... or would have plunged had not the
N. S. Wales mines then been on a pro-
longed strike.
But the strike ended and down he
plunged. Did he object to hewing,
blasting and loading into skips sixteen
tons of coal in a morning, stripped
stark naked, covered with black grime,
breathing the coal-dust, wounded from
time to time by falling rocks, sweating
to keep pace with the huge naked
German beside him?
Well, Sydney Hart kept his pants on,
a phenomenon in that strange black
world two miles under the Illawarra
mountains, but otherwise he positively
enjoyed it. He saw it as a test of his
endurance; and moreover there were
considerable compensations: the day’s
work lasted only three hours, finishing
at 11.30 a.m., and for those three
hours’ work he would earn from £4 to
£5.
But was he pained when, as so
frequently happened, the men went on
strike for the day and deprived him
of the fiver that would go towards his
caravan - home and his eagerly
awaited marriage with Betty, the girl
he had met on the boat?
The first day he arrived at work there
was a strike and he never knew what
it was for. Another time there was a
pit-top meeting to discuss whether or
not there would be a strike that day,
and a wallaby ran across the track,
and that decided it: everybody was so
interested in watching the wallaby that
they automatically went on strike with-
out any formal decision. But Sydney
Hart takes no dim or critical view of
these stoppages; and indeed it is most
interesting to see them from the
miners’ point of view which he instantly
adopted, simply as “a day off”:—
When Tuesday morning’s miners’
train grunted sluggishly out of
Bulli station it seemed to be pro-
testing against working on what
promised to be a typical hot Aus»
tralian day. There wasn’t a single
fleecy cloudlet to mar the spacious
glory of that vivid blue sky. . . . The
meeting dragged on and on. A train
headed towards the colliery station
from the direction of Sydney.
“There’s the Port Kembla train! ”
yelled a voice from somewhere in the
human pack. “Too late to start work
now; I’m going home.” The meet-
ing broke up. Everyone sprinted for
the train. . . . So the blue Pacific
and the beer-schooners won the day.
But, accustomed only to the minor
discomforts of submarines in war-time,
was he daunted by the terrors of the
bush when, duly married, he camped
in his caravan on a headland at Clifton?
Not Sydney Hart. When a dangerous
green lizard looked at him, he fought
it with a mattock. When bandicoots
jumped through the window —he seems
to have been much plagued by singu-
larly acrobatic bandicoots —he simply
threw them out again. He even got
friendly with the tarantulas in the end.
There with the bush, the mosquitoes
and the inquisitive retired pit-ponies
it was practically Paradise:—
Our freshly painted caravan
seemed to blend perfectly with the
grass-covered clearing, the chic
curtains and gaily-decorated awn-
ing added to the general effect of
completeness. How the hardy old
pioneers of old would have blessed
such a home had it been within
their powers to attain such bliss.
The neighbors were friendly, invit-
ing him to their homes for card-
parties, His workmates were friendly.
Neither snake nor spider bit him when
he went for a holiday in the Blue
Mountains; nor did sharks when he
went fishing at Austinmer. It was the
same when he first met the kindly and
considerate immigration officials on
shipboard; and the same when he left
the mine and went to work for the
Illawarra Brick and Tile Co. Neither
floods nor westerlies quite managed to
wash or blow away his home. His
wife successfully had a baby. Every-
thing except six-o’clock closing—and
of course we have since changed that
for him—was perfect.
Why, then, did this most enthusiastic
of immigrants leave us, and go back
to England, and get himself a job on a
ship?—
I think the answer of ninety per
cent, of returning emigrants—cer-
tainly my own —would be found
in the Australian newspapers under
the heading “Houses for Sale.”
Houses, at £2500 for “a four-
roomed wooden dwelling with a
corrugated-iron roof,” with a chip-
heater and no sewerage, were far too
dear and far too primitive; “very few
people in their senses would travel
12.000 miles in order to lower their
liv'i standards.”
LOVE AMONG THE ARTISTS
A pretty witch with long white fingers
And nails terrible and long
Sits by the heater shaping victims
To her wax-voiced song.
How quiet is her fallen hair,
The gentle movement of her hand.
The storms outside, the window's rattle,
She does not need to understand.
And soft she sings. Her red nails press
Like blood, like love upon the wax.
I rave and talk to her of bed.
She calms my fear with her true facts.
The storm outside, in you, (she says)
The tension of the wind and rain
Is love's pathetic fallacy
And not the picture of your pain ;
For nothing can reveal that truth
Except the shape of loved and dead,
And you must mould the human form
If you’re to hold it in your bed.
And though I touch her, strive to make.
She murmurs still her shaping song
And in my heart I feel the storm
Outside is mine and me and wrong.
The lovely witch that / must love
Cares not for what I feel or see.
She moulds a shape to understand
And lies with it and not with me.

Cas sell and Co.
The Cassell Miscellany, 1848-1958
is 872 pages of extracts from 112
authors Cassells have published in that
time, from Napoleon 111 on Julius
Caesar to Eartha Kitt on Eartha Kitt
—and what Napoleon might have
thought of Eartha —well, he was a
Frenchman, and might have been
amused by this latter-day darling of
Paris; but take the second excerpt,
from the story “A Terrible Tempta-
tion,” by Charles Reade in “Cassell’s
Magazine,” 1871: —
Bella Bruce was drinking the
bitterest cup a young virgin soul
can taste. Illusion gone —the wicked
world revealed as it is, how unlike
what she thought it was—love
crushed in her, but not crushed out
of her...., “Oh, papa! I thought
he would, I knew he would” . . .
What, then, Bella Bruce (a shocker
in her own day) might have thought
of Eartha Kitt’s story of her less-than-
underprivileged childhood in the
cottonfields, heaven only knows.
The most surprising discovery of
this huge anthology is that Oscar

from Cassell’s “Woman’s World,”

DECENTRALISATION
AND POWER
THE Prime Minister’s “meet the
people” tour has taken on so much of
the atmosphere of a pre-election fact-
finding journey that it is giving Labor
material for speculation.
A few weeks ago the eye of the
A.L.P. organisers was centred on the
possibility of a double-dissolution as
the result of the rejection of the bank-
ing bills. Indeed, there were old-
stagers who hoped that the P.M. would
be led into this course, which would
have given them an equal position in
the Senate campaign. They now realise
that the Government could go to the
country at almost any minute with an
ordinary dissolution ; and since they
have several more Senators to face the
electors than has the Government,
such an event, whenever it takes place,
is likely to end the Senate stalemate
and possibly end it for a long time.
Menzies seems to be having success
with his “chats.” He is not only “meet-
ing the people,” but he is meeting the
issues which are agitating them. His
speeches range from Constitutional
issues to industrial and economic
matters ; from Federalism to automa-
tion. But he is saying very little about
banking.
Any tour which Dr. Evatt might
make, on the other hand, could only
assure him that the burning issue, right
down to the roots of Labor, is himself.
But the ardor with which Comrade
Healy and others of his breed have
rushed to collect funds for him and his
Hobart Conference colleagues, even to
the point of openly depriving of
their livings those who refuse to sub-
scribe to the union political levies,
proves how much they count on him
for the realisation of their objectives.
The Communist party’s eighteenth
congress placed in the forefront of its
programme the call “for an all-out
effort to defeat the Menzies Govern-
ment and to bridle the warmongers,”
which, judging by Dr. Evatt’s attack on
Seato and other recent utterances,
seems to accord with his own
objectives.
The Communist party, in its general-
secretary’s thesis to the conference —
which contains the directive on policy
—adopted the A.L.P. economic policy
as far as it goes; and it shares with the
A.L.P. the call for “mass opposition to
the Democratic Labor Party.” It holds
that “the policy of the Labor party
agreed upon at Hobart and Brisbane
conferences would be a progressive
change in both foreign and home
affairs.”
Mr. Dixon, the chairman of the
party, declared:
The A.L.P., the trade-union move-
ment and the Communist party were
all agreed on the main questions of
peace.
He praised the “many good and
important decisions made by the
A.C.T.U. and union congresses.” And
his objection to the “moves to bring
the D.L.P. back into the A.L.P. and
move the A.L.P. to the Right,” on the
ground that “this would create a
dangerous position in the trade-union
movement and play into the hands of
monopoly,” is a clear pointer to where
Labor stands in relation to Com-
munism, this especially when it is
linked with the knowledge that the
leader of the Labor party is not only
agreeable for the A.L.P. to accept
funds for political campaigns from
Communist union-leaders, but has
defended their right to persecute those
who will not pay their illegal exactions
for A.L.P. purposes.
The stresses such matters as these
and the sectarian issue which Dr. Evatt
so rashly made his own, not to men-
tion the rich odors which arise from
politics in N.S.W., where the political
reputation of the Cahill Government is
like mangrove mud, are unknown to the
Liberal-Country party coalition. The
worst that Menzies' has to face is
grumbling from the back-bench. He is
able to devote himself to public issues
and doesn’t have to walk warily among
his own people for fear of being torn to
pieces by his own followers involved
in a Left-Right-sectarian battle round
his battered carcass.
Moreover, he is not committed, as
are Labor followers at this stage, to
support of large-scale gambling through
poker-machines and lotteries which,
however much the Federal Executive
would like to forget them as the pre-
occupation of the States, cannot be
divorced from the responsibility of
Labor as a whole.
He is able to debate the larger issues
of Federalism, of employment, of inter-
national politics and defence from a
constructive point of view and at a
time when construction is very much to
the fore ; when, in fact, the country is
bounding ahead and the two States
which are doing most of the leaping
are Victoria and South Australia, with
N.S.W. looking like the unplaced
favorite.
What issues will emerge as the
campaign goes on remain to be seen,
but the introduction of States
survival will be popular. It is a pity
that in strongly defending the need for
the States to continue as powerful
entities, Mr. Menzies did not stress
the need for more States for regional
development so as to remove the
necessity under which large, politically-
homogeneous regions languish in serf-
dom to the industrialised populations of
the capital cities. The New State issue,
is a live one at least in northern N.S.W.
and North Queensland.
The Prime Minister’s concern at the
growth of the public services will raise
cheers—though perhaps some ironical
ones. Some of his Ministers seem to
be in the hands of their departments
when it comes to administration.
Growth of the services, as Menzies
declared, when combined with centrali-
sation of power, can lead to tyranny.
Already at every election the united
force of the public services is used
through their associations to attempt
the intimidation of candidates and the
exaction of privileges and extra pay
and leisure.
The N.S.W. public service is flaunt-
ing the strength of its block : vote at
present into trying to frighten the Cahill
Government into granting it a month’s
holiday in the year on full pay.
These things mark only the threshold
of what may come. From the early
position it is but one step forward into
the realm in which, as in Iron Curtain
countries, Parliament is only a cipher
which exists by courtesy of the civil
service which makes the decisions.
Already every Minister at Canberra
is half-smothered in panjandrums
whose advice is nearly overwhelming,
all engaged in impressing on him the
Awful Responsibility of making-up his
own mind in the face of routine practice
as established by themselves.
These issues of decentralisation and
power which Mr. Menzies has raised are
vitally important, especially as they
affect finance and development. It has
no doubt taken some courage to raise
them, but they represent thinking that
should have been done long ago. It is
to be hoped that the P.M.’s discussion
of them foreshadows practical planks
in Government parties’ policy-speech.


PARADE OF THE CANBERRA CORPS
“Alter we’ve inspected these troops, sir, I suggest that we review the Department of the Interior.”


PLAIN ENGLISH
Mr. Bolte and Mr. Cahill
The Bolte Government goes to the polls
in Victoria next month, after being in
office since 1955, with the best
of any present State Government in Aus-
tralia (S.A. excepted) behind it.
In fact, it is beginning to vie with S.A.
in enterprise and development in a
manner which challenges even the success-
ful Playford regime.
Mr. Bolte came into office at the end of
a long period of political disruption on
the Liberal-Country-party side, and,
although the intra-party relationships are
not yet exactly a love-feast, he has shown
what commonsense and energy can do in
reconciling differences and getting work
done.
His initiative has been the driving-
force in attracting population and
capital and overseas industry to
Victoria, but he has benefited by the
unselfish help of Mr. Cahill in his
neighbor State, that worthy having
fostered everything in the way of taxa-
tion and deadening Socialism and ineffi-
ciency that it is possible for a Premier to
do so as to drive business and money out
of N.S.W. Indeed, in this-sort of enter-
prise has lain Mr. Cahill’s only signal
achievement.
In the past three years, being one-third
the size of N.S.W., Victoria has acquired
33.7 per cent. (221,000) of the total
increase of Australian population, against
absorption of 30 per cent. (199,000) by its
larger neighbor.
With over 2|-million people, and
gaining the greatest quota of any State
at an average of about 74,000 a year, it
looks forward to 3,600,000 in 1967 and
to a work-force of 1,600,000, as against
half that number in 1947. It looks for-
ward to Melbourne overtaking Sydney,
and Geelong overtaking Newcastle,
within the decade both in wealth of
industry and in population.
This is growth that is being planned
for, with roads, urban transport, water-
supply and 262,000 new dwellings in
town and country which will cost some-
thing in the region of £I4OO million. It
envisages a rise in its retail sales from
£Bll million last year to £llOO million
at the end of the next decade.
It does not envisage burdens of the
kind that are frightening capital away
from N.S.W. —automatic rises in the basic
wage, crippling land-taxes and probate-
and stamp-duties, or the kind of
sloth that marks Government activities
further north in Sydney.
It is helped in its drive for the future
by a comparatively solid and serious
press—the fate of the new “Argus”
proved how poor a field Victoria is for
sensationalism.
The fate of the Victorian Government
will be watched with more than normal
interest by the Governments of other
States.
Mr. Cahill will shortly have to take
the plunge of an election. And, even
after all he has done involuntarily to
help Victoria with his measures so that
he can claim to be at least in some degree
the architect of Bolte’s success, he
will find cold comfort in that gentleman’s
victory. His own fate is likely to be less
happy than that of his southern neigh-
bor—unless before the fateful poll which
his Government must soon face, he can
creep into a comfortable hollow-log as
Consul-General in New York or in some
other sinecure furnished by a complacent
body of the taxpayers whose burden'he
has been.
Northern Territory
Government
Northern Territorians, who
undoubtedly have their grievances (some
of which have been used as the basis of
organised demonstrations during the
visit of Territories Minister Paul
Hasluck), should keep in mind the essen-
tial fact that with self-government must
go taxation reasonably sufficient to make
both ends meet. Any other kind of self-
government is a mere sham which would
leave the Commonwealth still in control
in an underhand sort of way.
The composition of the electorate, too,
makes it impossible at the present time to
do much for the Territory in giving it
independence. So far from being
neglected, it has a Minister who has made
it his hobby and who has become subject
to some criticism for the intensity of
public service that has been expended
on it.
There was a time when the Territory
was a tough place to exist in. But now,
with comforts of civilisation provided for
the centres which hold the bulk of its
population, with good main roads, air-
routes, refrigeration and flying-doctor
services and radio-communication (and
even fadio- and correspondence-schools),
it has not so much to complain about.
In the process of giving it service,
providing air-terminals and communica-
tions, defence, scientific-research facilities
on a large scale from the C.5.1.R.0., a
very large civil-service population has
been inducted into the N.T. But the
taxation department has been kind to
the pioneering section of the N.T. popu-
lation and generally is by no means as
much in evidence as it is in the States
of the Commonwealth.
Waterside Rebellion
The continual dislocation on the water-
front caused by the two Communist-led
unions which seem to be left with any
real power—the Seamen and the Water-
siders’ Federation, along with some Red
leaders in subsidiary bodies —has come
to a decisive stage.
The month when ships are not left
unmanned or goods left rotting on the
wharf to suit the will of these industrial
outlaws is exceptional. The month in
which the Arbitration Court has not been
cluttered-up with their mountains made
out of molehills, denying other unions,
whose interests need more attention,
access to justice, is hard to re member .\
There has been the Hursey business
in Tasmania, with all its tyranny and bad
temper, and the Abel Tasman affair,
in which a brand-new ship in which each
crew-member has a single-berth cabin of
first-class liner standard, hot and cold
water, settees, wardrobes, dining-rooms
with refrigerators for their beer and
other luxuries, is left idle because the
owners had the temerity to bring her
to Australil with a British crew.
According to the union a crew should
have been flown across the world from
Australia, given a fortnight’s holiday, and
left to bring the vessel out on specially-
inflated pay to compensate them for
being away from home and Mr. Elliott
V. Elliott.
Now comes some more disturbance
over gang sizes, though the men did not
strike when their indignation hit them,
because they got a special Anzac Day
holiday and would forfeit their pay if a
stopwork was on.
It looks as if all the ports will be idle
over the gang issue. And this at a time
of recession, when some overseas
countries are faced with real depression.
Actually all the strikes have little
to do with the ostensible causes. They
are part of a campaign to impose on
the community the principle enunciated
by Comrade Healy earlier in the month
that unionists, despite the law, have the
right to strike “without any restriction
whatever.”
—j
Penrith's Dull Green
The exact tint of the County of Cum-
berland green-belt has never been pub-
licly proclaimed, but most citizens have
hoped, despite periodical doubts that
have been cast upon its purity, that it
is “sea-green incorruptible.” Latest
allegation that there may be a little mud
in the green comes from out Penrith
way, where approval has just been given
by Local Government Minister Renshaw
to the rezoning of about 200 acres of
land owned by Edinburgh Pty., Ltd.—a
concern owned by W. V. McCall (former
M. for Martin, and once known
facetiously as the “Minister for Mrs.
Freer”) and his family—which bought
the land about two years ago for £IO,OOO.
Formerly classed as rural land, the area
will now be available for subdivision
into residential sites. The senior town-
planning officer of the Local Government
Department, G. R. Mcßae, who advised
the Minister on the subdivision, has
resigned from the department to take a
position as associate director of Edin-
burgh Pty., Ltd.
A feature of the transaction that seems
to call for something more than a routine
statement is that the most surprised
people are those living in the local-
government area affected. Two aldermen
of the Penrith Council —one of them, B.
N. Fowler, was mayor of Penrith last
year and the other, W. L. Chapman,
represents the district in the N.S.W.
Assembly—claim that the proposed'sub-
division and rezoning were cut-and-dried


before the council heard anything of
them, and that aldermen had no warning
of the move until Mcßae called at the
council offices with McCall and presented
a detailed subdivision-plan. The Minister
says the rezoning was part of an arrange-
ment reached in 1956 as part of an
inquiry conducted by the department’s
commissioner, R. J. Thomson.
Alderman Fowler is calling for a
special council-meeting to discuss the
matter; Alderman Chapman is calling
for the production by the Minister of
documentary proof that council officers
were, as he avers, “progressively informed
of negotiations”; Opposition - leader
Morton is calling for an inquiry into the
whole transaction.
On the facts so far disclosed it does
seem strange that a deal of such
importance to an area should go through
without the knowledge of the people
living in the district. At least, it would
seem strange were it not for the fact
that under the present Government local
opinion is the last thing considered in
administering local-government policy.
Can We Fill Those Spaces?
[From “Ex-ACT”]
Nuclear energy, rainmaking and other
developments of peaceful science are
making it apparent that there will soon
be few uninhabitable areas of the world
(although other scientists are cooking-up
plenty of devices capable of wiping all
life off the planet in one swoop). This
means that the old cant phrase of Aus-
tralia’s “vast empty spaces” gets a new
meaning. It makes it certain that those
areas can be settled and developed—if
the people are available to settle them.
It is expected that about the end of
this year we shall have 10-million people
in this continent of*about three-million
square miles. That figure might have
astonished William Dampier, but it
carries no reassurance for us, especially
in the light of the U.N. economic report
on the “explosion” of population
currently occurring in Asia. There seems
little chance of checking the enormous
expansions of population in those Asian
nations where science and knowledge are
gradually increasing the brief life-span,
but where there is neither knowledge of
birth-control nor desire for it. China,
India, Soviet Asia, Japan and Indonesia
are all experiencing this upsurge, which
in many places is far beyond the ability
of the authorities to cope with in the
provision of more food, housing, jobs and
other development.
The situation in Australia and in the
sparsely populated but immense island
Of New Guinea vis-a-vis these Asian
countries is not enviable. Professor J. P.
Baxter, chairman of the Australian
Atomic Energy Commission, warned us
recently that we should not wait beyond
the end of this century—little more than
40 years off —to raise the Australian
population to a hundred-million. He
cautioned at the same time that if the
Russian industrial machine were to be
diverted to the output of export goods
the whole Western economy would be
undermined.
These are problems which demand
urgent statesmanship. We must, if we
hope for the survival of the white race
in this continent, not only develop our
resources at an accelerated rate but
increase our population by 10 times in
40 years. Is this possible, even in theory?
If it is, is any attempt going to be made
now to face the ‘ enormous challenge
which it offers?
The idea involves a population-growth
of more than two-million a year, which,
on the face of it, cannot be envisaged
through natural-increase and current
ideas on migration from Europe. Yet
only a few miles to our northward popu-
lations are going up by dozens-of-
millions a year, and the natural pres-
sures on living-space and food so
engendered are already causing some of
our leaders uneasiness.
The subject is one which could well
be ventilated in Parliament, not in an
alarmist manner but to allow some
reasoned debate on all the issues involved.
It’s not a political matter, but it is one
of life and death for Australia, perhaps,
within the lifetime of many Australians
now living. The nation should face it
now.
Fadden's Retirement
[Kroin Canberra]
Nobody was surprised when Sir Arthur
Fadden announced his decision to quit
politics just before the next Federal poll,
probably on December 6.
But what intrigued most people was
the manner in which he went about the
whole business. First an announcement
that he had resigned the leadership of
the Federal Parliamentary Country
party ; then a denial that he did not intend
to contest McPherson again ; later a con-
firmation of the long-held belief that he
would not stand again.
Fadden's genial manner, his sincerity,
rich fund of stories (political and other-
wise) and genuine application to any task
will be missed.
The interesting question is now the
fate of the Treasury after the December
election. Certainly Fadden will resign
the portfolio soon after he brings-down
his Budget early in August.
- The Budget will be pre-election
material, and will befit the occasion, as
its good-hearted draftsman always com-
plained that he “hated to do it” when
he had to bring-down the anti-inflation
Budget of 1952, and the Little Budget
in March, 1956, on both occasions
extracting money the painful way.
It will also be Fadden’s eleventh
Budget—a record.
After his resignation, P.M. Menzies is
expected to take-over the Treasury until
the poll is decided. He may even keep
it for a while afterwards.
Up to now, the Treasury has been
the price which the Liberals have had
to. pay for C.P. support in coalition
Governments ; but in recent years a grow-
ing voice of Liberal opinion from the
back-benches has been urging the P.M.
to secure the key-post for the Libs.
Menzies will not discuss the. future
plans, but, if he doesn't yield to the
internal pressures, the post will be a
certainty for C.P.-leader “Black Jack”
McEwen, now in the other key port-
folio—Tracie. -
What the Liberals keep pointing-out
is that with Fadden in Treasury and
McEwen in Trade, the entire economic
strings of the nation are being pulled by
the minority party.

Monk and Automation
For the leader of an organisation which
withdrew from the Labor Advisory
Council as recently as February 19, Albert
Monk's statement in Melbourne that
“the responsibility is the Commonwealth
Government’s to ensure that any change-
over to automation-plants will be pre-
ceded by proper planning between
management and the trade-union move-
ment” is hardly consistent.
It is accepted that Albert Monk was
one of the strong opponents of the move
in the A.C.T.U., and the withdrawal
motion was carried by as narrow a vote
as 9-7, but the move was sponsored by
the Communist - led Amalgamated
Engineering Union, and Communists have
recently consolidated their interests in
the organisation.
The Labor Advisory Council com-
prised employer and employee represen-
tatives, with Harold Holt, as Minister
for Labor, as chairman. Its purpose was
to advise the Federal Government on
employment, industrial relations,
employee-welfare and related industrial
and economic matters ; and it had dis-
cussed automation when the A'.C.T.U.
moved out.
Monk’s.complaint is that the experience
in England and West Germany was that
workers were dismissed without proper
planning and no efforts were made to
absorb them into other industries or other
cities, and that economic and social chaos
would always arise where management
failed to confer with the trade-union
movement when introducing automation,
making the unions apprehensive of the
transition period.
The principal reason given by the
A.C.T.U. for its withdrawal from the
Labor Advisory Council was its resolve
to present “a united front” to the Menzies
Government at this year’s election. There
is now no genuine belief among informed
unionists in Melbourne that the Doc. will
be the next P.M., and it is likely
that Monk's interesting statement was
addressed less to the Federal Ministry
than to unionists, hinting at the
inevitability of a return to the Labor
Advisory Council’s table.

A TAXATION-OFFICER had a phone-

wanted to know how much tax-instalment
should be deducted from her husband’s
weekly wage. The officer directed her
to the inquiry-office, but the lady
wouldn’t be put-off. She
wanted the information straight
from the horse’s mouth. The
officer discreetly made it a
hypothetical question. What
weekly wage, and how many
dependants? The lady readily
gave them, and was told that
the weekly tax - deduction
should be 12s. 3d. “I thought
so,” she said. “Wait till the

who died blind at 92 in Adelaide 10 or
12 years ago, always called his son Lew.
“Possum” was a nickname bestowed

a bush character in his own right, and

Lew through the Macdonnell Ranges.

in the Carlton colors, in the middle of

“Entali”: A chap who was an

(g. 2/4/’5B) connecting the mail-room to
the private quarters of the postmaster,
° n the early-morning mail-sortings the
postmaster might wish to speak with the
mail-room boss ; he would blow down
the apparatus, and the staff comment
would be either, “There’s the old man
blowing again” or, “There goes the
blower.” The apparatus was merely a
speaking-tube, similar to that in use on-
board ships ; this one had been installed
when the post-office was built, some time
in tbe ’Bo’s or earlier. It might be added
that there were telephones also in use in
tbe mail-room and throughout the post-
office, but the “blower” was invariably
the means of communication between the
mail-room and the postmaster’s quarters

Shaftesbury Avenue. I was hurrying
on my way, on my first day of seven
days’leave from France, when a dignified
elderly woman stopped me, saying, “We
are so proud to have you Australians
with us ; please accept this.” She gave
me a pound-note. Well, that was a help
with a limited paybook. A pregnant


woman answered my knock a< tho
Shaftesbury Avenue address ; a one-room
flat. Her hairy husband was shaving.
“Another blinkin’ Horsetralian; get
out!” The French lady had long since
been locked-up. And my cobber-
sergeant was still distributing her cards.

A SIMPLE EXPLANATION
“Skeletons of primitive man indicate clearly
that, whilst his limbs were bigger than those
of modem man, his jaw was smaller and his

That cave-dweller bold
Was a sight to behold,
With his rippling, voluminous muscles.
As well, he was blest
With a fifty-inch chest,
And billions of big, red corpuscles.
It’s likely he could
With a stout hunk of wood
Bowl-over a huge brontosaurus.
He was hard as a maul,
And to go with it all
He’d a voice that was deep and
sonorous.
So the legend was raised
He was one to be praised
As a he-man of marvellous toughness,
Who would domino dames
To establish his claims
As their lord; and they fell for his
gruffness.
He’s been pictured as one
Who derived all his fun
From being of girls the Great Terror-
May I shove in my spoke
And opine that this bloke
Was a sham, the belief just an error ?
From the size of the lug
That was stuck on his mug
It’s plain it was exercised daily
As he listened to Her
While she dug in the spur
Of a tongue built (we know) none too
frailly.
But his jawbone, IT shrank ;
And for this he’s to thank
Long hours in his missus’s presence
In the dimly-lit cave
Where the home-truths she gave —
How else, with enforced obmute-
scence ?

S. W. K.


NO CAUSE FOR ALARM
I HAD noticed that the pup
barked in a most peculiar
manner, as if his vocal
cords had all got into a
knot. After spending several
fruitless minutes trying to prise
open his jaws, which he kept
clamped shut in a vice-like
grip, I abandoned muscle for
stratagem, and told him about
the unholy row going on in the
council of the R.S.P.C.A. over
which was the the best method
of bumping-off hounds the
dog-lovers considered de trop.
As soon as he put his head
back and began to roar with
laughter I took a quick peek
down the cavity; but there
was no sign of quinsy, croup
or clergyman’s throat. It may,
of course, have been no more
than the upsurge of emotion at
the loss of a favorite bone he
had misplaced which had
wrought the sudden change in
Ethelbert’s voice from a basso-
cantante to a falsetto as he
barked ; on the other hand it
could be symptomatic of some-
thing more serious, like fret-
ting over the disappearance of
his fleas (I had not long before
given him a bath), or he might
be developing nodules on his
hackles, or the hives. So I
decided to seek expert advice.
When I arrived at the vet.’s
he was tying to a stake a
dahlia which I certainly would
have denied a place in my
garden. He looked down at
me and up at Ethelbert, who is
a bulky hound in whose
assorted parentage I take a
modest pride, and said in a
surly voice: “Struth! That’s
a funny-looking bitza!”
I returned his stare coldly
and said: “The dog may with
perfect justification make the
same remark to me about you.
After all, you certainly don’t
look to me as if you had a pedi-
gree a mile long. And, anyway,
if he is a bitza, what about that
debilitated thing you’re tying to
the stake? It looks like a
cross between a cauliflower
going to seed and a pee-the-
bed! ”
He bridled at that. “Let me
tell you,” he said hotly, “that I
paid ten-bob for that bulb!”
“You must have been in a
terrific hurry that day,” I
remarked urbanely, “not to
wait for your nine-and-nine-
pence change!”
I could almost see his mind
ticking-over furiously as he
tried to nut-out a snappy come-
back. He would probably, as
we all do, think of a brilliant
one a& he was cleaning his teeth
that night, or at breakfast next
morning. To try and disguise
his failure he turned the con-
versation back to Ethelbert.
“Anyway,” he said “what’s
wrong with the dog? He looks
all right to me.”
“Now don't let me interfere with your career. Beryl—
what time do you have to start Work?"
“You may look all right to
him, too,” I replied, “yet you
could and the possibility
doesn’t seem so remote to me
—be suffering from a hob-
nailed liver or a hangover.”
He let that one pass outside
the off-stump without attempt-
ing to nibble at it. “Well, why
the hell did you bring him
here?” he asked testily.
I explained that Ethelbert’s
vocal gears weren’t synchro-
meshing, and that I feared it
may presage the onset of some
malady.
“Have you noticed whether
he drinks a lot?” he asked.
“He would if I let him,” I
replied. “But I limit him to
two brandy-and-sodas daily
—he’s had them as a nightcap
ever since he was two months
old. I first began giving them
to him when I noticed him
twitching as he lay curled-up in
front of the fire. His nerves
were in a shocking state.”
“It is as natural,” said the
vet. sourly, “for a dog to twitch
as it is for a woman to cry or
a duck to go barefoot. Giving
brandy-and-sodas to a dog!
“I’ve never heard the like!”
“You probably have never
heard of a hippopotamus wear-
ing a hearing-aid,” I retorted.
“Yet would you be prepared to
swear that no river-horse in
any of the world’s zoos is wear-
ing one? As a matter of fact,”
I went on, “I have a South
African stamp which has a
hippo, on it, and under the
magnifying-glass there is what
looks distinctly like a cord
coming out of its ear!”
“That is the magenta 1911!”
he said excitedly. “I have that
one, too. Only the first issue
had that printer’s blemish. I
also have an 1898 five-piastre
one that carries no serrations,
and a Blue Mauritius with a
dark wave through it —a rare
one. I’d rather give my wife
away than that one! But why
didn’t you say you were a
stamp-man in the first place?
Come inside and have a look at
my collection. You can bring
your dog in too if you like—•
he doesn’t seem a bad sort of a
hound on a second look—nice-
shaped head, and he seems
intelligent. I’d say he picks
things up pretty quickly.”
“Just as good as any fowl,”
I replied proudly as he led the
way in.
Two hours and eight
whiskies later, the vet. gave
Ethelbert a fond tug at his ears
which set him howling, and
said to me: “Washer shay’s
wrong with him?”
I returned his solemn look
and replied: “Won’ hold hish
head up. Too weak in shtem,
an’ color of bloom fadesh in
shtrong shunligh’. Not worth
raisin’ if y’have to tie damn’
thing to a shtake!”
“I thought I’d bin had wi’
that blashted bulb!” sobbed the
vet. “Shoulda shushpected it
had hydatids! Whattid y’
shugges’ as remedy?”
“A course of distemper
injectionsh” I pronounced
authoritatively. “Also shome
shulphur in itsh drinking-water,
and cut-down to one meal a
day. “What about Ethelbert?”
“Give him a spray of weak
D.D.T. and shome liquid fowl-
manure, but not too shtrong
or he’ll get collar-rot.”
“I get that meself,” I said
mournfully. “Itsh all thish
blashted humidity! ”
It was quite a good session,
and before we parted on the
friendliest terms he had pulled
out his wife’s photo and howled
over it. I vaguely recall that
before I left he assured me that
I had no reason for any trepi-
dation concerning the falsetto
voice my cactus dahlia had
developed. It was, he
explained, just that it had
reached adolescence and the
trying period of the breaking
voice.

According to alarmed rustlings on the
grapevine between the Melbourne water-
front and the Trades Hall, industrial-
group strength has increased markedly
in the last 12 months, and especially in
the last few months since the Watersiders’
persecution of the Hurseys in Hobart.
Groupers have recovered much of the
ground lost at the time of the split three
years ago, and their activity and propa-
ganda have the militants worried; the
clashes at the recent stopwork meetings,
especially in Melbourne but also in
Sydney and Adelaide, indicated their
growing importance.
Although the unity-ticket—A.L.P. and
Communist —may win the July water-
front elections (currently they hold four
of 21 Melbourne executive positions)
the whips are already out so far from
home.

Lord Freyberg suggests that the
Maoris are the best people to negotiate
with the Russians. He told the House of
Lords of the time when a Russian general
and several staff-officers drove through
the Maori billets in the Trieste area and
ignored orders to stop. Maori guards
shot their tyres to pieces and shoved the
general and his staff in the cooler. When
released, the Russians showed no ill-will,
but invited Freyberg to dine with them.
We drank toasts to “that great demo-
crat, Marshal Stalin,” and “that great
democrat, Marshal Tito,” and I was asked
if I’d like to propose a toast. I asked
them to drink to “that great democrat,
Colonel Peter Awatere” —and they roared
with laughter.

“Postscript”: Agree with “Ex-ACT”
(B. 9/4/’5B) that sorters and postmen are
playing a shabby trick on the public by
their go-slow and similar delaying tactics
with mail. However, postal-workers
collectively have made their grievances
public and have taken these grievances
(some of them undoubtedly equitable)
“to the tribunal established at high cost
to consider them” without satisfactory
result. In fact, the postal-workers’ claims
have either been ignored, set aside, or
quibbled with for something like two
years.
But it is fairly apparent that the mail
side of the postal department is
Communist-infiltrated if not actually
-controlled, aftd until the mischief-
makers are removed or discouraged by
fellow-unionists, sly direct-action methods
will remain the means of harassing the
Government, big business and long-
suffering public alike. On the other hand,
in fairness to the more patient and law-
abiding majority, it is high time that
P.M.G. employees’ (especially rank-and-
file) claims were thoroughly considered,
and, in many cases, adjusted.

Australia, if possible, and re-erected at

Two years ago Tasmania was harvest-

expected to exceed £300,000. Apart from
the offer from Portugal (followed by a

Hobart), it is reported that other interests
have approached the holder of the
licence, A. J. Drysdale, but haven’t

The Doc.’s offer of exchange of pre-
ferences with the D.L.P. sounds like a
fair proposition, but in reality there’s
nothing in it for the Kane party. In a
typical electorate the D.L.P. may on past
performances be expected to poll between
a quarter and a third of the Labor vote.
The question of benefiting from A.L.P.
preferences will therefore never arise, as
they won’t be distributed. But the D.L.P.
prefs. will be and the Doc.’s party can’t
expect to win without them. Hence the
seemingly generous offer.

“Ex-Act”: When the Menzies Gov-

of Government-owned houses in Can-
berra to buy homes they occupied, if they
wished to do so, on very reasonable
rates. So far 1209 houses have been
sold for a total of £3,120,355 —a financial
gain which does not include the amount
of relief to the Administration in main-
tenance-costs. In June last the number
of Government-owned housing-units

Menzies has quite rightly expressed his
opposition to allowing a “token” quota
of Asian migrants to enter Australia
each year. Emphasising that difference
did not imply superiority, he said he felt
that a token quota, once introduced,
would grow, and that he did not want
prejudices and differences here as a result
of color.
The advocates of a quota seem to think
that Asian feelings are insulted by
Australia’s exclusion policy and that the
admission of a small number of Asian
people each year would end this resent-
ment. The argument is fallacious. A
quota for Asians and unlimited immigra-
tion for Europeans would surely be more
provocative than the present system is
said to be. And how is the quota to be
arranged? One token quota
for all Asians would be no
answer at all. And a separate
quota for every Asian (and
African) nation would mean
a total intake far beyond token
dimensions.

Revenue of the N.S.W.
Railways improved £3.3
million in 1956-57, and,
with expenses better controlled,
the credit-balance on opera-

million contributed by the State Govern-
ment, but charging £10.9 million (up £1
million) interest and sinking-fund con-
tributions, the final result was a debit of
£5.8 million. That compared with a
debit of £7.6 million in the preceding
year. Any such improvement in railway
accounts is to be welcomed.

“Collins Street”: Victoria has escaped
an attempt to rank it among the countries
in which a photograph of a woman’s

case in which a woman bookseller
appealed against a decision that an
allegedly obscene publication seized from
her shop should be destroyed. “As far
as I can see,” observed his Honor acidly,
“the pictures are a serious attempt to
produce something beautiful.” With this
well-directed aim at the thickly
(presumably) trousered rear of the official
busy bodies, he ordered the return of the

|Froin Canberra]
For the first time since his appoint-
ment as a Minister in 1951. Terri-
tories Minister Paul Hasluck is faced
with a crisis over the Northern
Territory.
His first task after a week-long
tour of the north was to prepare
a lengthy submission for Cabinet
on the local demand for expanded
Constitutional rights.
The Government was apparently
unaware of the resentment to its
refusal so far to grant a greater
degree of electoral reform.
When Territory member “Jock”
Nelson raised the question in the
Reps, no Government member had
prepared a case to answer him and, after
a hasty reassurance that Hasluck was investi-
gating the complaints, the urgency motion was
gagged.
Nelson threatens to resign, and means it.
Should it come to this he would immediately
re-contest the seat at the ensuing by-election
and would most likely have a comfortable
win. In this way he would hope to force the
Government to act.
The six independent members of the N.T.
Legislative Council who have resigned their
seats as a protest against the lack of Govern-
ment action would back Nelson, although they
are not Labor men.
Main reforms sought are wider powers of
self-government for the Legislative Council in
Darwin and a voting-right for the Territory
M.P. at Canberra.

Pat Coleman, new State president of
the Demo Labs in Victoria, is a well-off
finance administrator who runs his own
accountancy firm. This is not the usual
background of a Labor president and he
is not likely to be an inspiring vote-
catcher, but he has beaten A.L.P. opposi-
tion for the city-council seat he has
held for 25 years. He began in the Taxa-
tion Department, won a place in the
Education Department accounts-branch,
worked for Vacuum, and then began his
own business. He was generally acknow-
ledged to have made a good job of his
portfolio as Minister for Transport in the
last Cain Ministry, and the first-rate
Olympic venues now standing in Mel-
bourne are themselves a tribute to his
chairmanship of the committee belatedly
entrusted with the job of getting them up.
For much of his life he has been an
earnest worker for two Melbourne hos-
pitals and the blind, thinks the community
doesn’t give enough time to public
service, and that the Communist threat
to Australia comes from nowhere so
clearly as from China.

James H. Glowrey, Perth city-councillor
and publican, has decided to take things
easier by giving-up the management of
a leading city hotel with which his

Born at Corack (Vic.) 72 years ago, he
has acted as Lord Mayor on several
occasions. He’ll retain his seat on the
city council and an interest in the busi-
ness.
“First in action, last out,” seems to
sum-up the service of Brigadier Frederick
Gallagher Galleghan, D. 5.0., 0.8. E.,
E.D., during the Malayan campaign. In
the action at Gemas on January 14, 1942,
“Black Jack” commanded the 2 /30th
Battalion, the first Australian unit to
engage the Japanese. His leadership of
the prisoners-of-war at Changi has never
been forgotten and, even in his lifetime,
legend has grown around him.
No soldier likes to talk about his time
in captivity, least of all Fred Galleghan ;
“BLACK JACK”
but it is a fact that on Australia Day,
1943, he held a ceremonial parade of all
his troops and, standing under the Union
Jack, himself took the salute as they
marched past. It is further true that
when he left the camp his Japanese
captors provided a guard-of-honor for
him, in order to show their respect for
a soldier who had treated them as
soldiers and who had refused to let them
treat his men otherwise.
To his own men at the end he said :
“There will be no reprisals. We shall
march out as Christians, as white men
and as soldiers.” As honorary colonel
of the 34th Battalion, in which he started
his service in World War I, he continues
to influence a new generation of soldiers.
Brigadier Galleghan was deputy-
director of the Commonwealth Investi-
gation Service 1945-47 and again took-
up that post in 1950, when he returned
from being the head of the Australian
Military Mission to the Allied Control
Council for Germany. Now it looks as
if ill-health will terminate his services
in the C.I.S. early next year.
Black Jack has had a tremendous
influence on all who have served under
him. He says he is “trying to play
bowls.” His woods should run true —
they are marked with his regimental
color-patch.

Pat Lawlor: Harry Amos, who died

every national cham-
pionship in record
time. He helped to

Games Federation,
played an important
part in raising a

man for some time Richard Thompson,
M.L.C., has succeeded Roy P. Godfrey
as chairman of the City of Sydney
Eisteddfod, probably the largest organi-
sation of its kind in the world. Thomp-
son will make an excellent chairman. A
fluent speaker with a fine delivery, he is
essentially practical and down-to-earth ;
full of bright ideas, he can always be


depended upon to say and do the right
thing. Born at Paeroa (N.Z.) in 1906,
he was educated first in N.Z. schools and
later at Newington College, Sydney.

director and secretary of the Chain
Stores Association from 1935 to 1955,
Thompson has been a member of the
N.S.W. Legislative Council since 1940
(when sworn-in he was its youngest
member). He has been honorary
treasurer of the N.R.M.A., is a council-
lor of the N.S.W. Constitutional League,
of the Commonwealth Parliamentary
Association, of the Sydney Central
Methodist Mission, and president of the
Australian Debating Federation. He
was president in 1955 of the Australian
Automobile Association (deputy-presi-
dent, 1954-55), was Australian repre-
sentative of the World Touring and
Automobile Organisation and a member
of the United Australia party central
executive from 1935 to 1940. Fellow of
the Royal Economics Society and a
staunch supporter of Methodism,
Thompson is always good company and
suprisingly popular among those who do
not share his religious views or have

Doctors in the Navy have always been

days there is no difficulty in recognising
them in uniform, because of the red-

“Wavy” Navy enthusiasts during the
NAVY MEDICO
war were distinguished by their stripes,
but not so today, as the (R) in the execu-
tive curl denotes the Saturday-afternoon

It is difficult to see the (R) in this
sketch of H. Darcy Sutherland, lately
up for his reserve-training from his
practice in Adelaide, where, owing to
his collection of degrees in surgery, he
is known as Mr. Sutherland—thus con-

build are pretty well known, anyway,
both in the Navy and in Civvy Street.

Jim Kirby, managing-director of
Wapet (West Australian Petroleum
Pty., Ltd.), the show which from 1952
until the end of last year had spent some
£l4 million looking for oil in W.A., is
a large, friendly Yank who has been
34 years in the oil game. A brand-new
geologist from Stanford University with
a Phi Beta Kappa key tucked in his
dungarees, he started as a “roughneck”
in a Californian field, but since then has
been mainly an oil-geologist (as he
explains, you become a geologist by
study; you only become an oil-geologist
by practical experience) in the field, with
more administrative-level work of latter
years.
He was in Australia in 1950 as one
of the Caltex team investigating the
possibilities of finding oil here, and he
wrote the report which was largely the
basis of the decision to spend a few
million dollars looking for the stuff.
He came back in October, 1957, as
managing-director, having in the mean-
time been with American Overseas Petro-
leum, Ltd., the service company, and as
such responsible for general supervision
east of Suez, including, of course, Wapet.
The interlocking oil-company structure
is a bit bewildering to outsiders, but the
main thing seems to be that Wapet is
concerned at this stage strictly with
exploration (if oil is found it will be
an exploration and production company)
and is controlled by Caltex (80 per cent.)
and Ampol (20 per cent.). Wapet directly

whom the majority are now Australians

Canadian on the technical staff—but,
Kirby points-out, many of these Aus-

experience.
There are also a number of contractors,
who decide their own conditions of
work; for instance, one party works 10
hours a day, seven days a week, for sixf
weeks, then comes out for two weeks.
This group has elected to have no beer
in camp (in 115-in-the-shade country!)
and so, presumably, hits Perth with man-
sized thirsts. There’s an interesting story
in the human side of the various working-
camps spread over thousands of miles
of inhospitable country, supplied from
permanent bases at Derby and Lear-
month, and indeed, in the whole venture;
but, beyond remarking that all oil-
geologists are optimists, and that the
concern that struck a 10,000-barrel-a-day
well at Damman, in Saudi Arabia, had
just about given-up hope before that
happy consummation, Jim Kirby adroitly
side-stepped all approaches to the 64-
dollar question.

ABORIGINALITIES
BACKBLOCKS JUSTICE
/“'OURT-CASES were few and far
between in this tiny, sunbaked,
galvanised-iron township of the far out-
back, so that when one did turn-up every-
one made the most of it.
This case was no exception. All dozen
or so of the township’s males had
gathered in the single room of the school-
cwm-courthouse. The case was Rex v.
Lu Tin, alias Jungle Pig, a diminutive
spider-monkey of a Chinese who made
a thin sort of living tributing in an old
gold-show a few miles out. The charge:
drunken and disorderly conduct and
heaving a rock through the only store’s
only window.
On the bench, in shirtsleeves, and with
steel-rimmed half-mooned spectacles low
down on his nose, Kai Kai Miles, J.P.,
grazier, sometime butcher and (long
before) maker of history, summoned
from his close-in property at dawn by
police-tracker George, now hugely
enjoying, in Kempy’s cast-off khakis, the
temporary dignity of dutyless court-
orderly.
Kempy, the solitary local constable,
filled the dual roles of Crown Prosecutor
and Public Defender, the first by virtue
of his office and the second in response
to the promptings of his own kindly
heart —the Jungle Pig had cooked his
bachelor breakfast. Kai Kai, who had
been in town the day before and seen
everthing, was all for pronouncing
judgment there and then, but after
Kempy had been at some pains to demon-
strate the impropriety of this, settled
back in grunting, impatient silence.
It didn’t take very long. After 30
minutes Kempy had exhausted all the
possibilities of the case —law, fact, and
entertainment—and as he paused for a
moment, “You’re guilty,” shot-in Kai
Kai, who for some time had been glaring
from over his spectacles with almost-
convincing malevolence at the impassive
prisoner. “Now let me see . .”
While doom hung over Lu Tin’s head,
Kai Kai and Kempy went into a murmur-
ing huddle over a sort of Guide for
Justices of the Peace. Audible scraps
floated out to the delighted gathering:
“That’s assault and battery with violence
... try the next page . . . murder . . .
where’s drunk and disorderly conduct?
... A tenner? You can’t fine the poor
that much. Make it a quid ... A
quid? All right.”
“Lu Tin —make him stand up, Kempy
—this court finds you guilty of the
charges brought against you, and I
fine you one pound, plus six-and-
six costs of court, plus ten-bob for the
broken window. That’s one-pound-six-
teen-and-six. Twenty-four hours . . . But
hold on!” And while everyone waited to
see what next, Kai Kai, pulling a shining

thought so. You’ve owed me thirty-bob
for beef for a long time. One-pound-six-

pounds-six-and-six. Twenty-four hours

The Jungle Pig paid, and with Kai Kai
Kempy and general public, adjourned to

“Macleigh”: Can kangaroos swim
(B. 16/4/ While patrolling the rail-
way between Hillston and Roto, waiting
for the flooded Lachlan to submerge it,
we saw three kangaroos coming towards
the line. As they sighted us the big buck
broke away from the others and with his
head turned to watch us went unhesita-
tingly into the deep water in a cutting.
He skied for a second on his hind legs
and then turned completely over and dis-
appeared head-first. But he soon regained
balance and swam to the bank and
climbed out. His head was well out of
the water as he swam, and when he got
out he shook a lot of water out of his
coat. Considering this and his generally
bewildered air after his dip, I wouldn’t
think a ’roo would voluntarily take-up
swimming.

“Keyovadee”: Camouflaged in the
foliage of the young fig-tree, the big
green mantis seized the unwary black-
banded orange hornet in a flash. One
spiny foreleg jack-knifed on its head, the
other closed on its soft abdomen, the
hooked terminal spine digging-in cruelly,
she began to eat, the legs first, crunching
the hard material in her strong jaws.
She chewed her way through the tender
hind-portion, taking a mouthful at a
time, raising and twisting her head
around, large bulbous compound eyes
ever-watchful. The thorax now, and then
on to the head, and it seemed as if she
watched greedily as one papery wing
escaped, fluttering to the ground. Later
I saw this pious hypocrite leisurely devour
another two garden-friends, a 13-spotted




ladybird and a small ichneumon fly.
She left the foliage for the dark-brown
branches, changing to that color, and
after she mated there her smaller male
contemporary vanished, - presumably
eaten by this most ferocious monster of
the insect world. Now she is gone too,
and hanging from the underside of a
leaf is the typical tough papery bread-
loaf home of many little embryo mantids.

“Sevenelms”: Strawberry, having had
a foster-calf foisted on her, was tediously
unenthusiastic about infant-welfare, and
the bowser was only available to orphan
by irksome dint of my holding foster-
mum by the horns morning and after-
noon. My neighbor arrived while I was
on this regular chore and smiled
indulgently at my bovine naivete.
“Stand clear,” he said, “while we stir
up some maternal instinct,” With that he
sooled his kelpie on to the calf, the out-
raged cow charged the dog through the
fence, and one minute later calf was being
solicitously licked for the first time.
Thereafter the milk-bar was permanently
open.

“K.E.” r~ One thing the prolonged
drought of sou’-west Queensland has
taught outback gardeners is that the
natives can “take it.” While rose-plants
died and usually-sturdy zinnias wilted,
the grevilleas, gossypium, acacias,
Geraldton wax and their like throve. A
helipterum grew two feet at the height of
the blast and without aid of water.

“Lignum”: Recently a small but select
band of hunters from Broken Hill went
out into the Paroo country (far n.w. of
N. S. Wales) with an unusual commission:
to capture 26 wild camels for various zoos
and sanctuaries in the U.S., including two
for Hollywood. It was a tough assign-
ment and it was soon learned that
" Ah-ha !”

“L. M. Coo”: A station-owner in the
Coonamble (N.S.W.) district engaged an
ex-ship's-steward as cook. Before leaving
for a short holiday in Sydney he fold
him there was a hen setting in a big cask
in the store, and asked him to look-after
the chickens, which would be hatched-
oujt in five days’ time. When he returned
a fortnight later he asked about the
chicks, and the cook told him 13 had
hatched, but that after four days they
started dying, from some cause that had
him puzzled. When the owner asked
what he’d given them to eat, the babbler
said: “Eat? Struth, don’t they suck?”

“Sevenelms”: Jaws that long chomped
on chicle, the latex of Aclirus sapota,
now jounce on jelutong, the sap of Dyera
costulata. Chewing-gum makers got the
former from a tropical American tree
which also produces a valuable dark-
green timber whose specific gravity is up
in the 70’s. The latter is tapped from a
Borneo tree notable for its size and cork-
weight wood. This jelutong’s main point
of shipment is that balmy peaceful port of
Labuan, which so many Aussies knew
when it was neither.

“Tootroo”: Plentiful in this part of
S. Q. after summer rains, the com-
paratively hard-bodied “water-holding”
frog digs in to the soil before the onset
of winter, having stored-up sufficient
water in its body to allow it to spend
the greater part of the year underground.
The abos. made use of this habit, and dug
the frogs for the water they contained.
Fishermen in these parts won’t put this
fellow in a tin with other live frogs when
capturing fish-bait, deeming the w'ater-
holding bloke a cannibal.' I’ve rescued
many a shrieking frog from one of these
sharp-nosed, mottled, and pugnacious
hoppers, and not always small-fry, either.
I have known them to paralyse the hind
legs of the larger green tree-frog, which
cries and struggles helplessly when its
foot is gripped in the mouth of the
amphibian aggressor. The woman over-
coming the naturalist in me, 1 can
never wait for the outcome.
GARDEN WEEK
Week, held this year for the
first time at and in the Olympic
Pool instead of at Wirth's Circus, was a
convincing demonstration that the chief,
if not the only, form of spiritual expres-
sion indulged in by the majority of Mel-
bourne’s population is its gardens.
Anybody who doesn’t believe that had
only to go along and, looking down from
the diving-platform into the depths of
the pool, observe the numbers of ladies
in an advanced state of intoxication
clustered round the stand of Mr. Kirk-
bright apd drinking-in draughts of
beauty from an Anthurium scberzianum
maxima, a string-of-hearts, or an
A Iphelandra squarrosa (variety Louisa);
swooning in tne fragrance of a Phila-
delphus rirginale, a Mexican mock-
orange, a winter-sweet or a shrubby
honeysuckle in the Chandler preserve;
and fiercely discussing with their
husbands the respective merits of a
liquid-amber and a Cupkessus brunniana
aurea as an exclamation-mark for the
middle of the front lawn. And, like con-
noisseurs'of wine, they frequently showed
that they knew more about them than the
nurserymen who reared them.
The largest number of excited patrons
was to be seen gathered round the indoor-
plant bars, of w'hich there were quite a
number. Now that houses, furniture and
pictures are contemporary, plants have
to be contemporary too ; so the nursery-
men have been flat-out ransacking the
tropical jungles of Brazil, Queensland
and New Guinea for anything that
naturally grows crooked and queer or
is unnatural as to tone and color ; an
acalypha, a leopard plant and some of
the philodendrons look as if they had
been invented by Picasso, just as modern
houses look, as if they had been designed
to accommodate orchids rather than
human beings.
Garden Week was inaugurated in
1924 by horticulturists who wanted to
perpetuate the memory of the late John
Cronin, one-time director of the Botanic
Gardens, and year by year it has grown
in variety and beauty. New and fair
objects for a suburban gardener's con-'
templation this year included the cutleaf
beeches and birches, as'delicate as ladies’
fingers, the weeping maples, the Japanese
winter-hazel, with its pendant golden
spring flow'ers, the New Zealand wine-
berry, Viburnum carlcephalum, a
splendid cross between Carlessii and
Burk woodii, the snowberry, the winter-
flowering Luculia tsetensis, with white
flowers as gloriously fragrant as those of
its pinjc cousin, and the Queensland
poplar so-called.
A curiosity was Gingko biloba, the
maidenhair tree. Like the abo., it is the
sole surviving member of a large family
which flourished at the same time as
Homo neqndertaiiensis, and which
is now only known as a fossil.
An improved feature was the section
devoted to the wonderful Australian
flora and due to the horticultural enter-
prise of Mr. Sparks, president of the
Garden Week committee.
In the centre of the pool was a magni-
ficent display from the Dandenongs
nursery of Mr. Woolrich. Alluring as
the show was, however, it could have
been improved if the pool, instead of
being drained, had been filled with water,
with gigantic waterlilies, like the ones in
the Botariic Gardens, Adelaide, floating
on it and frogs and flowerlike girls
diving off them. This idea is free to the
committee for exclusion from its next
year's programme.

More Credit Released
"DETWEEN January and April
last year the central bank
called-in £6B million of what
is termed “surplus investible
funds” from the trading-banks,
carrying the total of special
accounts with the central bank
up to £340 million.
This year, between the end of
February and the end of April,
the £340 million has been
drawn-upon for £35 million —
£l5 million eight weeks ago
and £2O million last week. The
special accounts now stand at
£305 million, which is still £32
million higher than in January,
1957.
The release of this “frozen”
money has been prompted by
the fall in our export prices
and the effect of drought on
primary production, which
have resulted in a reduced
volume of money in the hands
of the banks and the public.
Dr. Coombs, governor of the
central bank, has said that
“further releases Will probably
be made before the end of
the financial year as the flow
of tax-funds to the Govern-
ment and movements in
our international reserves
reduce the liquid assets of the
banks.”
The Bulletin pointed-out
towards the end of 1957 that
the second half of the 1957-58
financial year would be the
tough part, and that is the way
it is-turning-out. In an endeavor
to make last year’s affluence
balance-out this year’s lowe-
income, the central bank is
using its compensatory power
of the special accounts.
This power, of course, is
limited in its benefits, and is
something like conserved
water; it is not as good as
regular rainfall. The economy
would be in better shape if
overseas prices were still firm
and rural productivity had not
been impaired by adverse
seasons. Still, the funds now
being released are real savings,
and are not artificially created
credit.
The release of these funds,
though, still needs to be made
with full regard to the state of
the economy. The mere release
of funds will not make it more
.
profitable to grow wool or
wheat at overseas depressed
price-levels, and profitability
should still be a governing
factor in the budgeting of many
industries. The high cost ot
building transparently exces-
sive labor-costs—will still curb
incentives in the building-
trade.
The unemployment situation
needs to be watched—but
watched carefully, and not
accepted at its full statistical
value. There appears to be
ample employment still
available for most skilled labor,
and a considerable proportion
of the unemployed seem to be
unskilled workers, with, no
doubt, a fair sprinkling of
unsatisfactory workers who
would be likely to be put-off
first in any recession.
It is not entirely to be
desired that, say, the first 2 p.c.
of unemployment should be
accepted as the full motivat-
ing factor in credit policy.
Some unemployment is bound
to arise merely when a change
from overfull employment
takes place. Unemployment
figures should be studied more
deeply ; an exhaustive study of
them is obviously worth-while
from many points of view.
M.L.C. Bonuses Up
■pOR the fourth time in the
past five years the Mutual
Life and Citizens" Assurance
has raised its bonus-rates.
In the Ordinary branch the
net rate of interest-earnings
was £4 1 Is. 4d. per cent., an
increase of Is. 6d. per cent.
In the Industrial, net interest-
earnings were £4 3s. 3d. per
cent, (down Is. 9d. per cent.),
the drop being entirely due to
heavier tax-provisions.
New business written was a
record, and the total of sums
assured (including bonuses)
at December 31 was £525
million,
Emphasis in the co.’s invest-
ment policy last term was on
mortgages (including home-
finance) and new premises,
although debentures and notes
(the present popular form of
company-finance) together
increased more than the growth
in Government securities.
Shareholders received a
dividend of ss. 6d. per £1 share,
a very slight increase on the
preceding year.
Ampol Rights
ALTHOUGH Ampol
Petroleum, Ltd., went to
considerable trouble to explain
the nature of its rather complex
note-issue and share-issue (B.
12/3/’5B), the method adopted
by the daily - papers of
quoting the market for the
rights to the note-issue is
rather misleading, even if
perhaps unavoidable.
Rights to the notes are quoted
in two words, “ditto, rights,”
under the ordinary shares, but
there are no rights to ordinary
shares available yet, though an
ord. issue has been announced
for which the books will close
in April, 1959.
What are available are rights
to take up 6 p.c. unsecured con-
vertible notes at ss. each, which
automatically become ss.
ordinary shares on May 1, 1963.
Rights to these notes are
quoted at 4s. in the share-
market, which means 9s.
when paid for in full on appli-
cation on May 23. The market
for the fully-paid ordinary
shares is at 13s. 6d. These
ordinaries are entitled to partici-
pate in the one-for-six issue of
ordinary shares at par in April
next year, but the notes are
not. Yield, ear-rights to the 1959
issue, would be £5 10s. per cent,
from the ordinary shares at
present price and dividend.
The notes, until after their
conversion, have'priority over
the ordinaries as to capital;
after conversion they partici-
pate in profits as ordinaries, and
the yield on a 13| p.c. basis
would then be £7 ss. per cent,
on the present market price.
Their immediate yield on a
6 p.c. interest basis is £3 6s. per
cent.
Carbon-black Industry
rl 'rnm “01(1 or>i»n<Ml t”J
"fA/ITH the establishment of
’ * petroleum-oil refineries
in Australia it is a logical and
essential development to set-up
carbon-processing plants as
well.
Carbon-black has many uses
and is as valuable a commodity
as any country could wish to
produce.
It is the main ingredient in
the processing of rubber, the
coloring-agent in printer’s-ink,
and has many other applica-
tions in a wide range of essen-
tial industrial products.
In principle the production
of the best carbon-black is a
simple process. It is created

by burning gas with insufficient
air for complete combustion.
Under these conditions a flame
impinging on a metal plate will
deposit carbon similar to the
well-known lamp-black on the
glass of an oil-lamp. Tire
deposit is scraped from the
plate and, after certain treat-
ments, is, ground to the con-
sistency of a face-powder.
There are modern variants
to this process, but, as can be
imagined, it is not a particu-
larly clean business.
It is unfortunate that with-
out flow-oil in Australia the
location of refineries had to be
determined by tanker-port
facilities and product-distribu-
tion demands.
The plants are very close to
our densest fringe-areas of
population.
In all other countries carbon-
black is produced either from
natural-gas in remote areas or
from other carbonaceous
material in the “black” zones
of the heavy-industrial towns.
You don’t have to be
directed to “channel plants” in
Texas. The dirty black smoke-
cloud is visible for miles.
It is said that in the early
days, the carbon people had
difficulty with labor-turnover.
They were forced to round-up
a working-force from the
inhabitants of the hill-country.
They put boots on the men
and taught them to stand up-
right. They did get some use-
ful work out of thejn until the
novelty of being black waned
and the hillbillies returned to
their hideouts.
The Australian Carbon
Company, on the brief pub-
lished statements, looks like
adopting a cracking or thermal-
decom position process from
residue tar,
This plant is likely to be
far less of a nuisance than the
Altona (Vic.) people fear.
Oh the capital-expenditure
proposed the new company is
undoubtedly prepared to spend
money in making the industry
reasonably clean. Develop-
ments in automation should
materially assist.
The production of carbon
products is the most challeng-
ing type of business to have to
establish near any populated
area. Carbon in powder-form
is surely the most elusive, pene-
trating and vexatious substance
known to man. It is likewise
one of very great value.
The proposal to establish
should not be obstructed, but
rather investigated with the
greatest co - operation and
frankness existing between all
interested parties.
Australia’s Export
Problems
tfr'rom Canberral
HTRADE circles in Canberra
•*- are more than worried
about the decline in sales of
Australian primary produce
overseas, particularly in the
United Kingdom. But, apart
from the vigorous sales-
premotion scheme they have
inaugurated, they can do little
to counter the steady drop
reflected in prices.
The U.K. is Australia’s big-
gest market abroad for
primary products, but success-
ful inroads are being made
yearly by importatipns of
“foreign goods,” despite Ihe
Australian-U.K. trade-agree-
ment of recent years.
These inroads have threat-
ened the stability of trade
between the two countries and
may soon be the subject of
special talks on the highest
level between officials of both
nations.
Australia and N.Z. are des-
perately trying to push sales
of Australian butter against
the almost universally accepted
Danish product.
From the outset both Aus-
tralia and N.Z. are handi-
capped by the. distance factor.
They both provide yellow,
salted butter which goes down
well with Londoners, but not
with the northern English, who
prefer the white, unsalted
Danish butter.
Danish butter arrives in
London fresh as against the
Australian import, which is
stored for months in London
and released as butter-brokers
think fit.
While several brands of
Australian butter are selling
in England under their own
names, most Australian butter
is blended with other butters
to be known as an “Empire
butter,” which is widely distri-
buted.
Prejudices against this
blended product are actively
concerning the minds of trade
officials, who realise what
damage unskilfully blended
butters could do to overall
Australian trade.
The trade-officials are also
worried about flour exports,
which have slumped in recent
months. The Government is
being pressed to review flour
exports as against wheat
exports.
The Government has gone
so far as to bring the matter
before the Governments of
France and Germany, which
are making inroads to the
traditional and geographical
markets which Australia has
enjoyed for many years.
Both France and Germany
grant subsidies to floPr-
exporters and are believed to
be unfairly encroaching on
previous Australian trade-
preserves, particularly in Asia.
By no means is the Trade
Department finished with the
matter. It intends to fight
it out to ensure Australian
markets in South-east Asia.

leader, Mr. Morris, and is
being greeted with considerable
interest by several companies,
including some which envisage
Queensland as a suitable centre
for developing Far Eastern
markets.
While this kind of thing* is
not overdone it must be of
eventual benefit to Australia.
At the same time, it may be
doubted whether the inevitable
State-versns-State issues which
will arise will be desirable.
Mr. Bolte, who became alert
to the danger after his own
mission was completed suc-
cessfully (his critics in other
States may suggest that this
attitude resembles that of
“Khrush” towards nuclear
tests), has made the statesman-
like proposal that an all-States
promotion-committee should
be established to attract indus-
tries and capital to Australia.
There is great merit in the
idea, and the overseas investors
would probably appreciate the
opportunity of being allowed
to make their own decisions
on where plants should be
located and money spent.
Bolte’s thought on this is that
it would be a matter for
“friendly competition” between
the States.
Anyone who has watched
the “friendly competition”
between the States for Com-
monwealth hand-outs at Loan
Council meetings and Premiers’
Conferences will know exactly
what Bolte means. Mr.
Cahill’s reaction to the idea
is as yet unknown.
Blue Metal Industries, Ltd.
A LTHOUGH there has been
a slight slackening in the

year, Blue Metal Industries,
Ltd., and its subsidiaries should
be doing well. No difficulty is
likely to have been experienced
in paying the interim at the
rate of 10 p.c. p.a. on the
increased capital, since earnings
for the year to September 36
last were equal to nearly 20 p.c.

position in its industry, and is
largely self-contained. Recently
there has been considerable
modernisation and expansion
in the group’s plant and works
generally, involving an outlay
of £697,395 last year alone.
But depreciation has not been
neglected, and, judged by tax-
provisions, profit has been con-

The financial position is quite
comfortable, having been
helped by last year’s issue of
£395,754 of new capital.

Although visible reserves are
subject to goodwill on consoli-

premium on the shares, the
strength of the organisation
seems to be largely in what is
not visible in the accounts. An
era of considerable expansion
appears to be ahead, granted
normal economic conditions
over the next few years.

mercial oil. Right. But at least
as far as W.A. is concerned the
effort has been productive of
things of inmense value apart
from oil.
To begin with, the last six
yearn has produced more
knowledge of the geological
structure of the big State than
was gained in the previous
hundred years. Not thaj the
surveyors and geologists hadn't
done a good job. Considering
their limited resources they’d
covered a tremendous area with
surprising thoroughness, and
anyone who wanted informa-
tion on practically any area,
including the deserts and the
rugged regions, could get a
pretty good picture of the sur-
face, and often of what they’d
be likely to strike at shallow
depths. They could find out
what minerals they might
discover in most localities, and
they could rely on the informa-
tion.
But the picture was still
general, and often vague.
Distances weren’t known
accurately over large areas, and
even the best maps contained
more gaps than data. Take
the Canning Basin. When Can-
ning put his stock-route and his
rabbitproof fence through the
deserts he surveyed for miles
on either side of the final
route; other surveyors and
explorers left tracks on the
charts ; but the region remained
one of the big unmapped areas
of the world.
Then Wapet began its search
in this basin of 105,000 square-
miles, and up to last June
magnetometer aircraft had
flown over 68,000 square-miles
of it, 25,000 of which had been
surveyed in detail. Also, as air-
craft need certain guides for
this work, two ground-survey
parties were sent into the basin
to plot astro-fix points; which
means there are points in that
desert whose positions are
known with absolute accuracy.
I doubt if you could say that
about most of the big towns in
Australia, or even in the world;
and those points will be invalu-
able starters for future detailed
surveys of the north.
But the great immediate gain
from the oil-search is the roads.
Before 1951 no one went into
the Rough Range country
faster than a horse could carry
him. Now heavy trucks race in
over roads that are feats of
transport-engineering.
One W.A- firm alone has
built 5000 miles of roadS and
access-trails; over 6000 miles
of roads and trails have been
carved through the Kimber-
leys ; vehicles have been driven
500 miles into the Canning
Desert; you can go, easily and
quickly, where no one with any
sense would have thought of
going six years ago.
The inaccessible country has
been brought close enough for
civilisation to get a glimpse of
it and form an appraisal ; and
that’s good for both civilisation
and the inaccessible country.
There have been other gains.
A great number of young Aus-
tralians have been trained in
the latest methods of searching
for oil; outports, such as
Derby, have gained additional
cargo-handling facilities and
new roads to the hinterlands;
there are bulk-fuel-handling
facilities at Derby, and a semi-
permanent camp at Grant
Range ; and the average Perth
man now speaks familiarly of
places he’d never heard of, and
what’s more he has some idea
of what he’s talking about.
You can point to dozens of
examples of benefits which
don’t show-up particularly in
the overall picture, but which
are going to have a big effect
on the development of the
north.
It stands to reason. To last
September Wapet had spent £l3
million in its search. And you
can’t spend that money, in a
well-directed effort, without the
country where it’s spent bene-
fiting substantially.

Stage and Music
Malko in Brisbane
When a conductor builds a
programme entirely from estab-
lished concert warhorses,. he
runs the awful risk of having
to play everything superlatively
well. What with the madden-
ingly lifelike recordings on sale
and the vast amount of music
on the air, everyone in the
audience becomes so adept at
picking flaws that the atmo-
sphere easily becomes one of
hypercritical gloom.
Nicolai Malko began the
Brisbane subscription-concerts
with such a programme, and
the merest novice could hardly
have failed to notice that the
concert took a long time to
warm-up. A novelty, however
short, might have given some
sense of freshness, supplying
the orchestra with a challenge
and the audience with some-
thing to argue about in the
interval.
Mozart’s “Impresario” Over-
ture was the only non-romantic
piece. Very neat and precise,
it yet lacked the music’s
essential bustle and gaiety.
Every entry was carefully
ticked-off as though some sort
of musical inventory was being
made. Then followed some
Wagner, the superb Rhine
Journey from “Twilight of the
Gods.” The orchestra felt its
way through the score as
though it were quite unfamiliar
with it. There were too few
strings in a vast hall to allow
for the surge and swell that
make a Wagner concert thrill.
Oddly enough the best play-
ing here was in something not
mentioned in the programme.
Malko played for good measure
the lovely picture of dawn
rising over Brunnhilde’s rock.
This was a pleasant surprise,
even if the arrangement he used
broke off violently at the climax
of the dawn music to go charg-
ing down the Rhine with Sieg-
fried. Strings or no strings,
this music is worth doing
despite inadequacies.
Eugene Istomin played
Schumann’s Piano Concerto.
He has the steel fingers of the
young and very brilliant school
of American pianists now
becoming famous, but he
knows how to temper efficiency
with gentleness. More than
once he was able to stroke
from the piano a lovely tone
that almost hid the existence
of a multitude of tiny hammers
underneath the lid.
It seemed a different
orchestra that played Tschai-
kowsky’s “Pathetic” Symphony
in the second half. A more
“We like straight parts”
unsentimental performance
than Malko’s cannot be
imagined. His idea of the
music had little to do with the
title, yet remained quite valid
in that it let the music speak
for itself with a vengeance. He
took music that the popular
song has done its worst to
cheapen, rubbed away the
mush and made it exciting in
an unexpected way. The form
of the work stood out firm
and clear, and if it was not a
performance to reduce anyone
to tears, it did quicken the
pulse, especially in the great
swinging march of the third
movement.
This had all the fire missing
from the opening of the con-
cert, and Malko’s control of
his players was always some-
thing to admire. One dramatic
change from loud to soft was
so well-managed that it nearly
beat the hall’s famous echo.
The sombre colors of the
finale, well-caught by a respon-
sive orchestra, make applause
unnecessary. Here it seemed
an intrusion.

Gordon Watson
Bela Bartok’s Sonata (1926)
was included in the first recital
by Australian pianist Gordon
Watson at Sydney Con. For a
few bars it shows rhythm and
then plummets into a mael-
strom of dissonances ; for the
most part it is heavily per-
cussive, the composer’s
apparent object being to con-
ceal its lack of lyrical invention.
Mr. Watson, who can call
upon plenty of forcefulness to
back-up a very respectable tech-
nical equipment, gave it a
nerve-taut reading of drive and
energy.
A better challenge to the
pianist’s intellect was the Beet-
hoven “Eroica” Variations,
built upon a haunting theme
from the composer’s “Pro-
metheus” ballet. The whole
work was very well shaped,
each variation clean-cut, with
Watson’s innately strong
pianism finely controlled
throughout the varying com-
plexities. The filigree-work in
} ast variation, and the fugal
section, which is the keystone
, ocxs the musical arch,
we £ e beautifully played.
Some Liszt pieces—a Valse
Caprice on Donizetti opera
excerpts another transcription
Meicadente songs, and
the Venezia e Napoli —found
executant m a much more
relaxed and genial role. Yet,
though these pieces are by
nature light - hearted and
designed for the display of
virtuoso qualities, they are by
no means meretricious. This
was made abundantly plain by
Mr. Watson, whose interpreta-
tions revealed not only the
underlying strength of the
Hungarian’s music, but his own
sharpness of mind,

it had plenty of life, color and

much what it was.
“Square Dance” (Corelli

maddeningly accompanied by
a “caller” and didn’t seem to
have quite the enthusiasm one
associates with that American
institution, but it was eminently
musical and the dancing lightly
attractive.
The company really showed
its paces in the second half of
the programme, beginning with
a quite brilliant “Pas de Trois”
(Minkus-Balanchine), in which
Melissa Hayden, Allegra Kent
and Adre Eglevsky took turns
in some fascinating displays of
virtuosity—Eglevsky faultless,
and Miss Kent and Miss
Haydon nearly so, their arms
only occasionally making a
wavering betrayal of their legs.
Finally there was “Sym-
phony in C” (Bizet-Balanchinej,

stream of lovely movement and

have opened. The men —

and graceful, and the women—
Melissa Hayden, Diana Adams,

danced so beautifully that it
would be churlish to ask any

“The Shifting Heart”
En route to England. Richard
Beynon’s play dropped in at
the Comedy, Melbourne, and
the Comedy is within a stone’s-
throw of the suburb which is
the natural habitat of Poppa,
Momma and Gino Bianchi,
Maria and Clarry Fowler,
Leila and Donny Pratt, and
Detective-sergeant Lukie.
The backyard of the
Bianchi’s home was such a
perfect reproduction of 10,000
backyards in Collingwood,
Melbourne, that it was diffi-
cult for the present com-
mentator to remember that he
was sitting on a plush seat in the
Comedy Theatre and not look-
ing over the broken back-
fence of Poppa’s backyard.
Moreover, one had only to
walk out into Exhibition Street
at the intervals to hear the
distant murmur of mob festival
and mob warfare, like echoes
of the offstage noises, and it
only required a backdrop of
the menacing towers of Russell
Street police-headquarters to
make a complete illusion.
This was realism with a
vengeance. Add to it Momma’s
screaming, Poppa’s gentle resig-
nation, Gino’s pursuit of Venus
in the shape of an Australian
girl-friend, Maria’s pursuit of
Hymen in the shape of an Aus-
tralian husband, Gino’s bashing
by an indignant mob of Old
Australians, Maria’s misgivings
at having only a half-Italian
baby, and her husband’s doubts
about having only a half-
Australian offspring—all this
was such an exact reproduction
of the history of a family the
present commentator knew that
he felt as if he were looking
at television.
Mr. Beynon does not remain
exclusively on the level of the
“Say when!”
camera, however ; the ability of
the Italians to express both
positive and negative feelings,
and the inability of the Aus-
tralians to express anything but
negative feelings, is beautifully
depicted with a wealth of
gesture in Poppa, Gino, Maria
and the screaming Momma.
Mr. Beynon is said to have
written his play to state an
inter-racial problem, but com-
parisons with Shaw are beside
the question. Shaw’s characters
live in terms of his idea, Mr.
Beynon’s in terms of them-
selves, and you can come to
your own conclusions about the
problem. The only sensible
thing said in the whole play
is Poppa’s remark, “You punish
us, we punish you, no good, no
good at all.” The acting was
very living.
Tom Farley as Poppa,
Lyndall Barbour as Momma,
Madge Ryan as Leila, the
author as Gino, and Peter
Aanensen as Detective-sergeant
Lukie, plus the Collingwood
backyard, were just me and
you and you and me and the
gatepost.

“Across the Bridge”
There are style and suspense
in this Rank film based on the
Graham Greene story about
an international embezzler
who, with Scotland Yard on
his trail, gets across the Mexi-
can border from the U.S. after
having betrayed to the Mexi-
can police the political assas-
sin whose passport he acquired
by a near-murder trick. There
is some nice cut-and-thrust
between the clever escapee and
the shrewd Yard man, who
eventually exploits his quarry’s
affection for a dog to compass
his downfall.
The role of the German-
born financier is taken by Rod
Steiger, who plays it with most
appropriate ruthlessness and
intensity. David Knight is not
so effective as a mercenary
border-town truck-driver who
tries to beat the financier to
the betrayal of the assassin for
the reward. A soulful-eyed
cocker-spaniel acts like a
veteran, and the work of the
cameraman, using black-and-
white for odd angle-shots, is
excellent.

THE FAT OF THE RIVER
By LES SUCH
TF you ever get caught in a
depression, as many did 20-
odd years ago, I’ll tell you what
to do.
Get up to North Queensland,
even if you have to walk, and
find a bloke like Nugget, a
bachelor on a canefarm wanting
congenial company through the
slack season and the wet
weather. It’s not much of a
farm —on the wrong side of
the river in perpendicular
country and a mile from where
the butcher leaves the bread
and meat once a week. Nugget
is living on credit, and you’re
broke, so you have to live as
much as possible off the land
—and the river.
But you won’t starve. In
fact you’ll live on the fat of
the land—or river—if you
invest in a couple of quid’s-
worth of fishing-gear and make
a boat.
At this time of the year the
barramundi come up the river
and, boy, are they good eating!
They weigh anything from 10-
501 b., and you can carve steaks
off them and make a rich soup
with their heads, tails and
backbones. These noble beasts
will be your chief diet for the
six months you stay there, and
they’re easy to get if you know
how.
Once a week you get meat
and spuds, and that goes on
Nugget's account. There’s not
much else you need —only tea,
sugar and tobacco. Growing
outside the humpy are oranges
and lemons and, in the creek,
watercress. Papaw, grana-
dilla, guavas and cherry-
tomatoes grow wild. And green
papaw for a vegetable is hard
to beat. These things provide
your vitamins. And, of course,
you have eggs from the chooks.
Now, the barramundi!
The way to catch them is to
stretch a stout line from bank
to bank of the river just before
dark. Depending from the line
are about 40 lighter lines 6ft.
long, baited with live mud-cod
on large hooks (the old barra.
has a mouth half the size of the
rest of him). This is called a
grab-all. It blocks the river so
you can’t miss. You always get
at least one barramundi, even
if only a 10-pounder. But you
must have a boat to retrieve
your catch when you get a
strike. You can’t swim out
because of the ’gators. So you
sit down with pencil and paper
and draw a boat —everything
has to be drawn before you
make it. “Yes,” says Nugget,
“but” —— “No buts,” you
say. “All it’ll cost is a quid
for solder.” And next day you
start.
First you find a 16ft. length
of three-by-two lying around
the place. That’s the keel. At
each end of this you join your
stem- and stern-posts. Then
you beat-out flat four sheets of
old roofing-iron, lay them side
by side and end for end and
nail the inner edges to the keel
with lead-headed nails. Next
you find two lengths of two-
by-one for gunnels and fasten
them each end to your stem-
and stern-posts, propping them
open in the waist with three
feet of pickhandle. That’s your
main thwart. The other two
are very short ones fore and
aft.
In the stable you fluke just
the thing for the main, and
only, rib—a half-circle of half-
inch iron rod. You join this
at the ends to the gunnels where
the thwart is and in the middle
to the keel. Now you bend.the
roofing-iron and start in with
snips and hammer and lead-
headed nails until- you’ve
fashioned a 16ft. tin, canoe
which, when all cracks and nail-
holes are soldered, will carry
six grown men and which one
man, a strong , one, can carry
on his back upside-down.
It takes a couple of days for
the pair of you to build, but it’s
worth it when you see her float-
ing right-side-up. A coat of
red-oxide will prevent rust and
you can bash against all the
snags in the river without sink-
ing. And she won’t warp in the
sun.
fashions 6ft.
paddles from slabs of white
beech that he split in the
scrub. You can carve it like
cheese and, anyway, being a
Tassie he’s a wizard with an
axe. Later on you add a floor
of crossed battens and even rig
a mast and sail.
So much for the boat. Now
for the fishing.
You smartly find-out that
fishing all day for bait in the
lagoons and sitting-up all night
for the barramundi doesn’t
work-out, so you tie a bell onto
the grab-all, light a fire on the
sandbank and coil-up in
blankets. When the bell rings
you both wake, bolt down to
the canoe and carry-out the
accepted drill.
Nugget tumbles in and seats
himself with the torch while
you push off and ease yourself
over the stern as soon as she
floats. Then you go out along
the line hand-over-hand until
you see the barramundi jump-
ing like a game-fish in the light
of the torch with the bait right
down in its belly. And do you
think he doesn’t look good next
morning lying on the sandbank,
silver scales glinting in the sun,
waiting to be cleaned!
Then home for breakfast.
Roll-up swags and fishing-gear,
pack them in the boat and
push off upstream to the
backwater where you park.
A quarter - mile walk up
through the headlands to
the humpy and you light
the fire and put the pan
on the stove while Nugget cuts
the fish-steaks. Then the big
gorge, with home-made wheat-
meal bread and green papaw
served like vegetable marrow,
then into the bunk and a snooze
until noon. Just like black-
fellows.
And you dress like black-
fellows, too. A pair of trunks
and a hat; not even shoes. No
clothes to wear-out. You get
tanned-up and your feet get
hard and you only shave and
dress wherr you go to town,
which is very-seldom. The best
way to go to town, seven miles-
from the nearest point of the
road the other side of the river,
is by paddling and pedalling.
You pack your pants, shirt and
shoes into a sugar-bag, wear
your good hat, balance the
bike midships across- the
gunnels of the canoe and
paddle half-a-mile downstream
to the place where the road runs
close to the river. Here you
step ashore without capsizing
the canoe, make her fast to a
tree that also hides her, leave
your trunks and scramble up
the bank with the bike and
your clothes. Then you get
dressed and pedal into town.
TT’S a primitive existence, but
good if you’ve had an
overdose of the city. You soon
organise things so that you
enjoy quite a bit of leisure.
You initiate others from neigh-
boring farms and let them
supply the bait in return for a
cut of the barramundi catch,
which you can’t possibly eat
yourselves and have no way of
keeping fresh. So it becomes
a habit for all to meet at the
sandbank every other day at
sundown, they with the bait,
the billy and the tea, and
Nugget and you with the gear.
Then, the grab-all set and
baited and the fire alight, you
all stretch-out and swap yarns
until you doze off. Then the
alarm and —another big fish!
On wet days you sit in the
humpy and carve wood.
Wonderful timber, that white
beech—they’d pay quids for it
in Sydney, and here you have a
whole tree cut-up into slabs.
Nugget carves paper-knives,
chessmen, and even a pair of
dogs. The floods come after
a week’s rain culminating in
a mighty electric storm by the
light of which you sit-up all
night to watch the lOOft.-high
trees on the river - bank
gradually disappear under the
water. In the morning it laps
at the door of the humpy half-
a-mile from the river, up in
the foothills of the coastal
range.
This ends the fishing for a
week, and cuts-off your supply-
line of meat and spuds. So
you're isolated on a diet of
poultry and eggs. But it’s not
hard to take for a change.
When the river goes down a bit
you try other ways of fishing
because it's still too wide to
stretch the grab-all. You’re
not a sportsman, but a bloke
who wants fish to eat. Gelig-
nite’s hard to get and, anyway,
too expensive, so you make a
three-pronged spear out of
fencing wire on a 12ft. haft,
borrow an acetylene light—that
penetrates water more than any
other light and drift slowly
downstream hugging the bank,
at night, of course.
By this time you’ve prac-
tically turned into a nocturnal
predatory animal. The nights
are warm and there are no
sandflies in this neck of the
woods, so you don’t suffer.
You don’t get the hauls you did
with the grab-all but you always
get something to eat eels,
bream and other fish you don’t
know the names of, and the
spearing is much easier than
it sounds. Then on a sunny
day you take a short-handled
spear and a pair of Jap diving-
goggles and go in after them,
pinning them up against the
pile of a bridge. That’s not so
hard either, if you can dive.
Years after you’ll tell the spear-
fishermen in Sydney about this
and they won’t believe you.
And so another slack season
passes.
The wet finishes at last, the
days grow cooler and the nights
cold. Then the crushing starts
and you’re on the end of a
cane-knife, head down, tail up,
knocking-out a cheque that’ll
take you back in luxury to the
Big Smoke.

Australian National Industries, Ltd.
T ONG-TERM possibilities, rather than
*- J the prospect of immediate benefits,
would appear to have been among the
main factors influencing Australian
Nat’onai Industries’ decision to drop the
Rootes-group franchise in favor of
distributing-rights to a section of the
Ford range.
The Ford Motor Co. of Australia Pty.
—an offshoot of one of the world’s two
largest car-manufacturers —has greatly
increased the locally-manufactured con-
tent of its products in the post-war
years, and, since completion last year of
a £3-million expansion programme at
Geelong (Vic.), has announced plans for
the erection of a huge assembly-plant on
a 400-acre site at Broadmeadows, near
Melbourne.
A. N. I.’s agreement with the Ford
Motor Co. will come into force on June
9 next, from which date A. N. I. will
distribute Consul, Prefect and Thames
(commercial) vehicles in the Sydney and
Brisbane metropolitan areas and at
Canberra and Newcastle. The co.,
through the wholly-owned John McGrath
Pty., previously held a franchise, cover-
ing N.S.W., Queensland and A.C.T., for
Hillman, Humber and Sunbeam cars and
the Rootes commercial range (Commer,
Karrier, etc.).
Coupled with the statement that other
dealers may be appointed to handle Ford
products in large suburban and country
centres, a comparison of the appropriate
registration-figures for 1957 suggests
that A. N. I. is by no means assured of
an early increase in the number of units
sold:

In total, 3646 Rootes-group vehicles were
registered in N.S.W., Queensland and
A.C.T. compared with 3411 Consul and
Prefect cars and their commercial
counterparts. In the metropolitan areas,
including A.C.T., the figures are Rootes-
group 1727 and Consul, Prefect, etc.,
1485.
It should be remembered, of course,
that the distribution of motor-vehicles is
only one of A. N. I.’s several interests,
representing, in terms of paid capital, no
more than 25 p.c. of the total subsidiary
investment. It was this fact, and the long
association of the McGrath cos. with the
motor-trade, which prompted the co. to
change its name in 1956 from John
McGrath Industries, Ltd., to Aus-
tralian National Industries, Ltd.
Formed as a holding-co., A. N. I.
acquired the paid capital of John
McGrath, Ltd., in 1951 by the issue of
eight f.-p. ss. ords for each f.-p. £1 ord.
in the older co. (registered in 1911). Par
issues in 1952 and 1954 (one-for-four)
added £l-million to paid capital, taking

holding-cos., controls 17 subsidiaries
including, in addition to John McGrath
Motors Pty., Australian Forge and
Engineering Pty., the largest producer of
drop-forgings in Australasia. Other
major subsidiaries are:
National Forge Pty., Melbourne. (Press
forgers.)
Industrial Sales and Service (N.S.W.) Pty.,
Sydney and Cooma (N.S.W.). (Distributors of
earthmovjng, roadmaking and material-handling
equipment, cranes, power-shovels, etc.)
Melbourne Iron and Steel Mills Pty., Mel-
bourne. (Manufacturer of all types of steel.)
Perkins (Aust.) Pty., Sydney. Branches or
associates in Queensland, Victoria, S.A., W.A.
and Tasmania. (Steel and machinery mer-
chants, distributors of petrol and diesel engines,
power-shovels, etc., electric generating-sets,
and, in N.S.W., Diamond-T trucks.)
The wholly-owned Industries Insur-
ance, Ltd., underwrites insurance risks
for the group.
A large swag of intangibles, £1,365,638
at July 31 last, and a correspondingly
high bonus-content in the capital-
structure, have helped to keep earnings
at a moderate level in relation to paid
capital, the div.-rate, cut from 8.3 p.c.
to 5 p.c. last term, averaging 7.6 p.c. over
the past six years.
With motor-vehicle sales lagging,
largely as a result of the steep jump in
sales-tax rates, and a weakening in the
demand for a number of other lines,
group-turnover fell away (to an undis-
closed figure) during the year ended
July 31 last, while the “increased costs
of selling in a market contracted by
credit-restrictions and other economic
regulations” further reduced earnings.
Consolidated figures show net profit
down by £116,245 (or 40 p.c.) at
£168,029, but, as the accounts cover a
period of 15 months in respect of all but
one of the operating-subsidiaries, an even
greater fall in the rate at which profits
were gathered-in is indicated. Before
arriving at the lower profit, £156,413
(down £65,452) was provided for taxa-
tion and £213,524 (up £34,305) for
depreciation:

As a percentage of share-capital (all in

against 11.3 p.c. in the preceding term
and 12.4, 11.3 and 8.1 p.c. in the three

The sale of premises rendered surplus
to requirements by the purchase, in the
1956 term, of a seven-acre site adjoining
the co.’s large properties at Lidcombe
(Sydney) strengthened working-capital
(up £329,716 at £1,055,445) over the term,

these sales being used to write-down the

As a result, the cost-/eyi-depreciation
value of fixed assets fell by £309,632.
A sizeable overdraft (down £81,498)

form, approximately half of the out-

Tighter trading conditions are reflected

ing with the quieter tempo of trading.
According to the board, sales and
profits over the eight months to March
31 last “have been maintained at last
year’s level,” the sharemarket adopting a
reasonably cautious attitude by pricing
the f.-p. ss. ords. at 3s. sd. cum div. (a
2\ p.c. interim) for an effective yield of
£7 11s. lid. p.c. from a 5 p.c. distribu-

Love and Co.’s record, in this field, as a
consistent profit-winner and div.-payer
reflecting sound and experienced manage-
ment and, possibly, a degree of caution
in the. assessment of profits.
The co. has never failed to pay a div.
in any of 36 years since the public
acquired a share-interest, a succession of
10 p.c. and 12y p.c. distributions over the
34 years to 1955 giving an average div.-
rate of 11.1 p.c. for that period. The div.-
rate was dropped from 12} p.c. to 7} p.c.
in 1956, following a four-for-five bonus
issue. Paid capital, increased to
£833,534 by a one-for-ten par issue in
September 1956, is all in f.-p. £1 ords.
Manufacturer and merchant, Clifford
Leve and Co. is engaged in the drygoods
trade, mills and factories in the Sydney
suburbs of Lane Cove and Enfield
turning-out oatmeal, cornflour, starch,
dextrines, adhesives, essences, etc.
The sole subsidiary, Stratton and Sons


Pty., conducts a flour-milling business at
Cootamundra (N.S.W.), and, in addition,
owns a large grazing-property. Stratton
and Sons was acquired at the end of the
1955 term by the issue of 116,500 £1
ords., at a premium of 345. 6d. a share,
and, judging from the improvement in the
parent co.’s earnings over the last two
terms, the investment has proved a par-
ticularly profitable one. Starch produced
from wheat-flour milled at the Coota-
mundra mill is finding a ready market
with industrial users without competing
directly with the higher-grade maize
product.
A steadily-growing demand for many
of the lines manufactured by the parent
co. has strengthened turnover in recent
years, while economies resulting from the
installation of modern and efficient plant
have offset, in part, the effects of rising
labor- and raw-material cost :

Last term (to September 30, 1957) a
number of manufacturing-departments,
previously housed in the Kent Street
(Sydney) premises, were transferred to
the new Enfield mill, and “the greatly
increased costs occasioned by the moving
of partly-manufactured products from
one point to another” for further pro-
cessing, along with other expenses con-
nected with the transfer, contributed to
a £1640 slip in net earnings.
Claimed after providing £37,311 (down
£7572) for depreciation and an undis-
closed amount for taxation, the £67,147
profit represented-a return of 8 p.c. on
paid capital, compared with 9.1 p.c. in the
preceding term and 12.5, 15.7 and 13.9
p.c. on the lower capitals employed in
the three years back to 1953.
A heavy outlay on fixed assets over
the last few years has left the co. short
of working-capital, current liabilities,
including “provisions for contingencies,
etc.,” exceeding current assets by £168,758
at the end of last term. However, the
board plans to correct his imbalance by
the sale of valuable inner-city properties
which will be vacated with the transfer to
Enfield of further sections of the
organisation:

Funds released by the £35,360 fall in
book-debts, an additional £35,949 from
the bank and the allowance for deprecia-
tion provided most of the £125,848 spent
on plant and freeholds over the year, the
sale of the co.’s interests in a Victorian
rice-milling venture reducing sharehold-
ings by £12,405.
Anticipating the effect of drought con-
ditions on the supply and price of cereals,
the board arranged for the import of
maize from overseas countries early in the
current term, but, in view of the almost
complete failure of the N.S.W. wheat-
crop and the ban of exports of flour from
that State, the immediate outlook for the
flour-milling side of the business is far
from promising.
Nevertheless the co. has demonstrated
in the past that it can trade successfully
under difficult conditions, and the share-
market acknowledges this fact by pricing
the f.-p. £1 ords. at 30s. 6d. to return
£4 18s. 4d. from a 1\ p.c. div. Consoli-
dated accounts (September 30 last) show
net tangible assets of 21s. sd. for each
£ of paid capital.
Yarra Falls, Ltd.
TYUE largely to tighter import-controls,
Australian textile-mills had a busier
year in 1956-57, and the more efficient
woollen- and worsted-spinners and
-weavers in particular staged a sizeable
recovery from the relatively low level
of activity which had characterised the
two previous terms.
The conditions which gave rise to this
improvement have since gone by the
board, and the directoraie of Yarra
Falls, usually liberal in its distribution-
policy, played sale last year by retaining
£94,108, or 37 p.c. of the higher earn-
ings, and maintained an unchanged 8 p.c.
dividend, while last. week’s interim was
on the same basis.
By and large, the industry produces
against firm orders, and at present buyers
are none-too-eager to lay-in stocks until
they can get a glimpse through the haze
surrounding the now-easier import-
position, the Jap. tieaty and the uncer-
tain wool-market, whiie the stimulus of
a more rigorous winter would no doubt
be appreciated.
Equally hesitant, and unconvinced by
the improved showing, the sharemarket
prices Yarra Falls’s scrip at 245. (ex-div.)
to return a yield of £6 13s. 4d. p.c.
Always, since they first came into the
public eye in 1924, a steady, reliable, if
unglamorous, investment, these shares
were greatly overpriced at over 50s. in
1951 and were still selling at around 40s.
even after the 1952 steadier, when most
manufacturers were caught napping by a
falling wool-market while holding highly-
costed stocks.
No disturbing factors have been intro-
duced since then, the last capital-
movement being a one-for-one par issue
in 1950.
During the term to June 30 last, about
19 p.c. more in the way of business was
written by the Yarra Falls group, while
overall costs (including co.-tax) increased
by only 18 p.c., due in part to the
absorption of some of the excess capacity
which is usually a feature of the textile-
industry. Direct material costs, mainly
wool, increased proportionately with
turnover, and rates and land-taxes bore
more heavily, but wages and general
overheads were spread to better advan-
tage, as shown by the following
operating statements:

The compact group comprises four
operating divisions—the patent, Yarra
Falls, Ltd. (Melbourne), Globe Worsted
Mills Pty. (Sydney), and Yarra Falls,
Pty. (Dandenong, Vic.), which are
engaged in the manufacture of high-class
yarns and worsted cloths, and Byias Pty.
(Melbourne), which turns out silk piece-
goods. Much of the yarn linds an outlet
in an associated co., John Brown Indus-
tries, Ltd., a Bendigo (Vic.) hosiery-
knitter with a share capital of £220,000.
A more recent affiliation was with
John Heathcoat and Co. (U.K.), from
which the Byfas mill has acquired 52
looms for the production of synthetics
hitherto imported, and all output will be
channelled through Heathcoat’s Austra-
lian marketing division. The English
concern is also moving into fields outside
the ordinary woollen-worsted trade and
proposes to erect a factory at Burwood
(Melbourne), and, in partnership with
Yarra Falls, a dyehouse at Dandenong,
which will service both Byfas and
Heathcoat.
Improving by 58 p.c., consolidated
net profit for the year was £254,108
(previous year £160,686), after providing
£156,558 (£110,875) for taxation, £71,752
(£59,379) for depreciation on fixed assets,
and setting-aside £21,624 (£13,340) for
plant-replacement. A £36,005 long-service
provision dulled an otherwise very satis-
factory year’s performance:

Fimiston,
April 11, 1958,
Still, shareholders have little
cause for complaint, for,
although they put up £117,090
of share-premiums in 1956,
bonus-scrip handed out (one-
for-two) during that year and
in 1951 (one-for-five) accounts
for £23,4,180 of the co.’s
£643,996 ord. capital.
McDowells carries a large
range of medium-quality lines,
its well-located stores facing
George and King Streets. The
rebuilding of premises in King
Street was completed last term,
but, in view of the cost
involved, the board abandoned
plans for reconstructing the
old Kodak building (George
Street) and the property was
sold last year.
Although the latest accounts
(for the year to February 28)
cover the operations of the
finance-offshoot, W. T. Waters
and Co. Pty., for the first time,
the omission of information,
given in previous years, relat-
ing to gross profit, operating-
expenses, tax-provision, etc.,
detracts from the value of the
statements.
As a result the extent to
which higher expenses affected
the final result isn’t clear, but
the directors seem to regard
the “extremely serious” dis-
location and disturbance caused
by building - operations as
mainly responsible for the fall
in earnings and the apparent
drop in turnover.
Down £14,856 at £91,167,
the parent co.’s net profit was

(up £5000) for depredation
and an undisclosed amount for

Mary Kathleen Uranium
Y)yTTH the exception of the
mill, almost >all of the
capital items needed at the
Mary Kathleen opencut (near
Mt. Isa, Q.) have now been
completed and the co. expects
to begin production of uranium-
oxide “about the middle of
this year.” However, “a con-
siderable running-in period
may be necessary before full
production is attained.” At
the end of* last month 211,694
tons of ore were ready for the
mill.
M.K.U.’s contract with the
U.K. Atomic Energy Authority
includes an undertaking by the
co. to commence production no
later than March 1, 1959. The
contract is expected, to cover
a period of eight or nine years,
during which an annual output
of approximately 500 short-tons
of uranium-oxide is antici-
pated. Gross value of the
contract is given as “between
£4O million and £45 million,”
indicating a price per ton of
approximately £IO,OOO.
The board has given no
estimate of profits as yet,
claiming that it could be
“most misleading” to attempt
to do so, leaving share-
holders in Australasian Oil
Exploration, Ltd. (which
originally held 35 p.c. of the
share-capital), uncertain as to
the actual value of their indirect
interest in M.K.U.
Factors which could upset
profit-estimates include start-
ing-up difficulties, an inade-
quate rainfall and water-
supply (water-consumption will
approach 1,500,000 gallons
daily), the actual grade of the
ore handled and increases in
operating expenses.
Repayment, in quarterly
instalments, of the large sums
advanced by the U.K. Author-
ity and Rio Tinto (the major
shareholder), will commence
about six months after produc-
tion and may limit the amount
available, in early years, for
divs.
Up to December 31 last
M.K.U. had spent £6,535,568
on construction-work mining-
leases, buildings, machinery
and other fixed assets, another
£1,872,343 being represented
by current assets (£1,133,474),
exploration costs (£400,455)
and intangibles (£338,414).
When full production is
achieved, total funds employed
in the project will be in the
vicinity of £l3 million, of
which shareholders have put up
only £710,459 as share-capital.
Loans from the U.K. Authority
(which is to advance up to
£7 million) and Rio Tinto cos.
amounted to £5,580,000 and
£2,170,820 respectively, at the
end of last year.
United Uranium, N.L.
A S expected, United Uranium,
N.L., has been named a
beneficiary under the U.K.
Atomic Energy Authority’s
guarantee to the Common-
wealth, but details of the
contract remain to be finalised.
Research and pilot-testing
being completed, the designers
are now at work on the new
plant required at Northern
Hercules, where repairs to
existing plant and township are
reported to be “well advanced.”
To stockpile 20,000 tons of
ore at N.H. before the start
of next wet-season milling,
open-cut operations will get
under way next month at El
Sharana and an adit is being
driven below the level of the
planned open-cut for purposes
of drainage and exploration.

MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY
Wellington, April 21.
MEW ZEALAND’S overseas
reserves are not showing
the seasonal recovery which
might have been hoped for.
By April 9 they were only
£46.7 million, less than half
what they were a year before.
From February 5, when the
low point of £42 million was
reached, to April 9, the gain
was only £4.7 million. In the
corresponding period last year
the gain was £15.8 million.
After June the normal seasonal
decline in export receipts will
begin.
If present market trends con-
tinue, this year’s income from
exports will be £5O million less
than last year’s. That is the
latest estimate —and it is £2O
million worse than the most
pessimistic predictions three
months ago.
The latest Government pro-
nouncement comes from the
Minister of Industries and
Commerce, Mr. Holloway.
He says it will take “a con-
siderable number of years for
N.Z. to adjust its economy in
the fight of the overseas-
reserves position and trading
prospects.” There is little
doubt that he is right.
The Monetary Commission,
a year or two ago, expressed
the opinion that N.Z. should
have enough overseas funds to
finance six months’ imports.
That would now mean about
£l5O million. The figure,
however, is based on a level of
importing which must be
regarded as abnormally high.
A considerably lower level of
reserves would no doubt be
enough to cover reasonable
needs.
To Borrow Overseas
To tide-over the crisis, the
Government has arranged to
float a £2O-million loan m
London. The rate of interest is
6 per cent., the issue price £99,
and the optional maturity-date
1976-1980. The Government
has made it plain that the loan
will not permit relaxation of
import-licensing schedules. The
£2O-million will go into N.Z.’s
exchange-pool in London and
all of it will be required to
meet existing commitments for
essential imports, Government
and private.
The interest-rate is high—the
highest paid by N.Z. for very
many years—and the loan will
be at best a palliative. But there
is no doubt that, in the circum-
stances, the Government has
acted wisely.
London “Financial Times”
does not favor N.Z.’s case
against butter-dumping. A
British Government which
deliberately acted to put-up
the price of butter would be
prejudicing its political sup-
port, it says. Nevertheless, the
economic committee of the
Trades Union Congress, which
represents eight-million British
workers, has recommended to
the congress that N.Z.’s demand
for the imposition l of anti-
dumping duties should be sup-
ported. And the general secre-
tary of the British Agricultural
Workers’ Union said recently:
“Unless the Government does
take action against this dump-
ing, British housewives—and
also the nation —will eventually
pay dearly for the temporary
advantage they are enjoying.”
Butter—and Ottawa
Meantime, a N.Z. delegation
in London is discussing with
the British Government a pos-
sible revision of the Ottawa
Agreement which governs
trade between the two coun-
tries. It is understood that
N.Z. is asking for a reduction
in preferences granted to
British goods to levels similar
to those agreed between
Britain and Australia in 1956.
This would allow N.Z. more
room for manoeuvre in trade
negotiations with other
countries.
Whatever happens about
butter-dumping, N.Z. will
have to take active steps to
help itself. Diversification of
primary production is
obviously necessary if long-
term economic stability is to
be achieved.
In one sense it is taking
place already. The number
of cows in milk has remained
static for the last five years at
two-million, while sheep-
numbers have risen by about
four-and-a-half-million. But
much more is required outside
the present farming frame-
work.
Diversification
A Department of Agricul-
ture economist, Mr. J. V.
White, suggests the production
of more pig-meat by the dairy
industry and the growing of
more cereals. It is estimated that
the present 60,000 to 70,000
acres of wheat could be doubled
without any reduction in output
of lamb and wool.
Another practical suggestion
has come from the chairman
of the Dairy Products Mar-
keting Commission, Mr. R. A.
Candy. He urges dairyfarmers
to use up to 10 per cent, of
their herds as nurse-mothers
for vealers, thus switching
from dairy to meat production.
He says that the money-return
from the meat from three
vealers, which could be reared
by one cow, would be equal
to the return from dairy pro-
duce from a cow giving 3001 b.
of butterfat.
Live-beef Export
The export of live beef from
N.Z. to the United States is
being pioneered by an Ameri-
can cattleman, Mr. James
Delfino, who recently visited
the Dominion. Trial ship-
ments totalling 10,000 head of
cattle are to be made, begin-
ning about June. They will
earn for N.Z. something like
a million dollars.
Whether or not the trade
will be permitted to develop
remains in doubt. Both the
Meat Producers’ Board and
Federated Farmers at first
objected, but, after discussions
with the Government, agreed
to trial shipments.
The American demand for
beef is at present very strong.
Quite apart from the proposed
shipments of live beef, tens
of thousands of cull dairy-
cattle, boner-bulls and beef-
cattle have been bought from
N.Z. farmers in the last few
weeks for killing, freezing and
shipment to the United States.
Cull dairy-cows, usually worth
£8 to £lO, have brought from
£2O to £2B. It has been esti-
mated that this year’s beef
exports to the United States
will earn 30-million dollars,
against last year’s 12-million.
The Wool-cheque
The N.Z. woolselling season
will be completed on May 28
after one more round of sales.
So far about 886,000 bales have
been sold at auction in the
Dominion at an average price
of about 43|d. (N.Z. currency)
a pound. In 1956-57 1,055,663
bales were sold at an average
price of 54|d, a pound. Wool-
brokers report that at recent
sales support has been given
by the N.Z. Wool Commission
at floor-price values for the
different types of wool.
Iron-and-steel Industry
The establishment of an iron-
and-steel industry in N.Z. is
brought one step nearer with
the announcement that the
N-Z. Development Corporation,
which holds substantial rights
over ironsands areas and coal-
fields, is planning to convert
to a public company. Capital,
it is estimated, will ultimately
be £25 million.
The corporation’s basic plan
is to take ironsands by ship
from Kawhia, on the west coast
of the North Island, to a
refining-plant at the entrance
to Otago harbor, in the South
Island. The sands will be
mixed with coal from the
Benhar fields, 48 miles from
Dunedin, and the mixture will
be processed in electric furnaces
developed by a N.Z. scientist,
Mr. W. R. Martin, from a
Norwegian discovery.
At present N.Z. imports
342,000 tons of steel and 7500
tons of pig-iron a year.
The Minister of Mines, Mr.
Hackett, recently called for an
urgent report on ways of
speeding-up the development
of a N.Z. iron industry. He
said it appeared that a big
slice of overseas capital would
be needed.
Bonds and Shares
The Government is expected
to come on the local market
for a cash-and-conversion loan
of about £2O million in the next
month or so. A loan of
£7,700,000 matures on May 31
and another of £3,800,000 on
August 15. The Government
will probably offer to convert
both at the same time. A third
loan of £7,200,000 matures next
January. This may be dealt
with in a second cash-
and-conversion issue later this
year.
Government stocks have
lately been in keen demand in
the market, but a good many
issues are still yielding 5 per
cent, or more. In spite of the
Government’s announced inten-
tion of bringing interest-rates
down, it does not seem likely to
have much success in that
direction at present.
The decline in N.Z. share-
values, which began in the
middle of March, appeared to
be checked in the week after
Easter. Buyers came back
cautiously into the market at
lower prices for a wide range
of issues. On a basis of
immediate pre-Easter values,
rises and falls were fairly evenly
balanced. Dominion Breweries
recovered 2s. from their low
point of 845., N.Z. Breweries,
6d. from their low of 465. The
insurance leaders, however,
continued to weaken, New
Zealand to 795., South British
to 795. 3d. (N.Z. currency).
Whether or not values will
stabilise at around present
levels is not yet clear. It
depends on develQpments in
N.Z.’s economic situation and
the measures adopted by the
Government to deal with it.
Since the imposition of
import-control many Australian
manufacturers have been
inquiring about the possibility
of producing their goods in
N.Z. In other «ases N.Z
importers are seeking rights
to have Australian products
made here under licence. Some
of the larger projects under
consideration involve the erec-
tion of new factories.


Hemlock and
Nightshade
By E. O. SCHLUNKE
ONE of the reasons why
board was cheap at
Hemlock Agricultural
College was that the
school’s laundering was done
for nothing by another State
institution, the Nightshade
Girls’ Reformatory.
Each week the laundry was
taken in one of the farm-carts
by a dour Scots caretaker, a
man admirably fitted for the
task because he seemed to be
unaware that there was any
kind of allure in the female of
the species.
A massive gate in n high wall
surmounted by barbed-wire was
unlocked by a grim lady at
the reformatory, and after the
baskets had been delivered the
girls were left for another week
to the fearful travail of their
manless world: a state so
desperate for them that it had
to be expressed periodically in
orgies of window- and crockery-
smashing.
The despatch of the laundry
from the college was super-
vised by the matron, a severe
and competent woman who
took her revenge on the boys
for her maidenly state. Any
discrepancy between the boys’
lists and their pile of clothing,
or a garment insufficiently
marked, gave her an
opportunity; but the kind of
offence which made her really
vindictive was a student ogling
one of the maids who took
delivery of the laundry. Yet,
under her very eyes, un
noticed, there sprang-up a
traffic of a nature which would
have had her screaming with
rage.
TT began as “Gaffer” Harmon
was getting into bed. He
startled all the rest of his
dormitory with a loud cry ; the
kind of cry which brought
boys tumbling from all direc-
tions, for it had in it something
of the male beast.
Gaffer, so called because he
was much older than the rest
of the boys, and of a pro-
nounced rustic character, was
reading a note written in a
feminine hand:
Write me a letter and put it
in your pyjama pocket . May.
All the boys clutched for the
note. They each read it; they
nuzzled it and smelt it like
hounds around a cartwheel.
“What are you going to do
about it, Gaffer?” they asked
hungrily.
Some of them started to
laugh. Gaffer was a lad of
singular virtue ; the only one in
the school of whom the matron
had ever been heard to
approve; a fellow who went
voluntarily to church each
Sunday ; who looked shocked
when accused of trying to lure
one of the Methodist girls.
The note came back to him
as his right, though some found
it hard to let it pass from their
hands, and had to read it again
and again, lapping-up each
letter.
“Will you answer it,
Gaffer?”
Gaffer took it in his knobbly
fists and tore it in halves.
There was a great outcry.
“You big mug!”
“Aren’t you game?”
But the keenest and most
astute of them dived for the
remnants of the note.
“I bag her!” Prater shouted.
“I’ll give you two. bob fer
her,” yelled another.
“No, me! You give her to
me! I’ve always been a good
pal of yours, Gaffer. Good
old Gaffer.” This fellow put
his arpa around Gaffer's
shoulder.
“Let’s sell her by auction,”
suggested another, who always
had more pocket-money than
was good for him.
Gaffer gaped at them all with
outraged virtue, but with a
reluctant admiration for their
brazen daring.
“By rights I should tell the
principal about this,” he said.
“What sort of a girl do you
think she is? She must be a
thief, or she may even have
bad morals!”
“Bad morals, I hope,” Prater
said fervently.
Gaffer gave him a look, in-
credulous and sorrowful, then
he deliberately washed his
hands of the affair.
“Whatever you do is your
own responsibility,” he said,
trying to make it sound legal
and binding. “I want you all
to witness that I’m having
nothing more to do with it.”
■pRATER got her. He had
the note, and he had the
prestige. He was a noted lover.
His tales of his adventures, told
in the dormitory after lights-
out, set him apart.
According to Prater, he had
achieved manhood at the age
of 13, and in the three
following years had one affair
after another. The proof of it
was that he had often been
seen in the town with fast girls ;
girls whom Gaffer “wouldn’t
touch with a forty-foot pole.”
He was frequently out illegally
at night and he always had his
pockets full of such telling
souvenirs as garters.
In the taking-over there was
one technical difficulty. Prater
wanted to put his reply in
Gaffer’s pyjama pocket; “Just
this once, so I’m sure she’ll get
it.”
But Gaffer wouldn't let him.
He knew what was in the
reply, because the whole
dormitory had discussed its
composition; Gaffer was
terrified that the matron might
find it. Prater tried all his
art, until he was threatened with
a “crack on the nose.”
However, he took the place
close to Gaffer in the laundry-
queue, so close that the matron
stared at him over her glasses.
Prater always raised her
hackles, and she could smell an
enterprise like his a mile off.
But this time he was too
clever for her; he contrived
that Gaffer should drop his
bundle of washing ; his eager
helpfulness in picking it up
was admirable.
A/TAY got the note; the
answer came in Prater’s
pocket, and everybody read it.
It was delightfully crude and
rude ; even better than they’d
hoped for ; and they’d hoped
for something pretty hot from
a girl bad enough to be sent
to a reformatory. It inflamed
the boys so much that next
week there were letters in a
dozen pockets, some sneakingly
addressed to May, some, more
liberally, to “To whom it may
concern,” or, falsely flattering,
to “The nice little girl who
ironed my shirt so well.”
Gaffer was terribly upset. He
went about shaking his head,

telling fellows, separately, “By
Gee you’re a fool, you’ll be
caught for sure.”
And to others whose fall was
a matter of special grief : “I
didn’t think you would do a
thing like that,” trying to make
them feel that they were
blackening their souls past all
future laundering.
When the laundry came back
there was so much unaccount-
able excitement that the matron
remonstrated on it to the prin-
cipal. He made some inquiries
full of cunning psychological
dodges, but discovered nothing.
The next week there were so
many notes that the pyjama-*
basket crackled when its con-
tents were pressed down. The
maids couldn’t fail to notice.
They read some of the notes,
and Wfere filled with admiration
for boys so much more mature
than they appeared to be.
That started-off a new set
of vibrations whenever maids
and boys came into contact;
significant looks shot here and
there from eyes shining with
lusty excitement; there were
hidden smirks and suppressed
titters. The matron gave
twenty of the boys the
maximum punishment she was
allowed to exercise, and told
the principal that he would
have to sack all the maids
under 45.
But that, of course, didn’t
stop the letters. Punishments
for poor schoolwork were
handed - out galore. The
debauched and haggard faces
of boys who’d lain awake most
of the night in a fever of excite-
ment trying to compose a verse
as daring as the one they’d
received worried and baffled the
teachers. They had staff-
conferences about the sensa-
tional falling-off in “team-
work” and about the inexplic-
able apathy of all the senior
scholars.
The principal gave a fear-
some address to the assembled
school on the “slackening of
the moral fibre” which terrified
some of the more timid ones
at first. But soon it became
apparent that he hadn’t the
slightest idea of what was going
on.
Some of the ferment must
have seeped through to
Gaffer’s sap, for presently the
astonishing tale was going
round that he had a girl. He
was seen taking decorous walks
with her to church on Sundays ;
and at the park too, in broad
daylight, of course, when
hundreds of people were there
listening to the band. It was
all very respectable, a matter
of family-connections, and
blessed by the principal, who
played bowls with her father.
The lads made it their business
to look her over and tell
Gaffer what they thought of
her. Most of them had to admit
that she had much that was
desirable (and describable). But
Prater gave his disillusioned
opinion.
“Those church going girls are
no good. They might have the
looks and the figures and even
lead you on, but you never get
anywhere with them.”
“How do you know I want to
get anywhere?” Gaffer asked
disagreeably.
nrHEN a letter came from
May to Prater announcing
that she was going to be let out
in a month. She wanted to
meet him.
It was a development as un-
expected as it was thrilling; a
bit too thrilling for several
of the other fellows who
thought that the same might
happen to them, and who felt
that they might not be able to
live-up to the promise of their
letters. But most of the boys
were vastly envious of Prater’s
luck.
“What do you think of it
now, Gaffer?” they asked.
“Look what you gave away ;
the chance of a lifetime.
You’d certainly get somewhere
with May.”
Gaffer blinked his worried
brown eyes at them, and for the
first time he forgot to mention
his forty-foot pole. While the
dormitory was helping Prater to
arrange his assignation, Gaffer
was full of solemn warnings.
“You’ll be sorry if you ever
go out with her,” he’d say in
such a voice of doom that the
fellows decided that he must
have heard a very frank sermon
on the dangers of illicit love.
Prater made his appointment,
and then, with only a week to
go, and all Gaffer’s warnings
unheeded, there were two
sensations.
The first was that Gaffer
was going to leave school
abruptly, before the final
examinations, and thus lose the
chance of glory he had earned
through working hard while the
others were squandering their
mental energy in thinking-up
amorous rhymes and suggestive
drawings. He explained that
his father wanted him to help
with the wheat-harvest, and that
harvests were more important
than examinations, and that
was all about it. He acted a
bit strangely, though. No one
could make-out whether he was
resentful towards his father, or
whether there was something
else to it.
The other sensation came
two days before Gaffer leT.
The principal came into the
hall where the laundry was
being collected, and, with the
face and manner of an execu-
tioner, ordered that no one
should leave. He then went
to the pyjama-basket afid began
to take notes out of pockets.
He read two of them, but then
he acted as if a forty-foot pole
wouldn't be nearly long enough.
His voice shook with
emotion. It was so dramatic
that after it was all over some
of the boys declared that, in
a crazy sort of way, they had
enjoyed it; they wouldn’t have
missed it for anything. The
Head made a terrible denunci-
atory speech, but he had to
curb himself when it came to
handing-out punishments. He
“Put the light out and come to bed !”
asserted that he was entitled to
expel them, but obviously
couldn’t expel so many, par-
ticularly the seniors, who were
due for their final examinations.
So he set them continuous
study, night, day, and holidays,
with an iron-bound curfew, and
teachers patrolling the grounds
and roll-calls at all hours.
Harmon, of course,
” was one of the few to
escape. For his last couple of
days he had authority to do
what he liked, to go and come
as he pleased.
The night for Prater’s
assignation arrived, but he
hadn’t a hope of keeping it.
The teacher on duty came
round at irregular intervals,
even after they were in bed. The
only unoccupied bed was
Gaffer Harmon’s.
TpOR Gaffer Harmon sat on
a park-bench at a slight
distance from a precociously
mature young g'.rl, telling her
what he’d done to save her
from Prater, and the others
from themselves.
‘‘Eve got them all locked-
up,” he said, with a triumphant
laugh.
May laughed too, but con-
tinued to look at Gaffer as
if she wasn’t quite sure what
to make of him.
“I thought I had a right to
do it, because, in a way, I
started it. I shouldn't have ever
said a word about your first
letter.”
*‘Oh my! ” said May. “What
a mistake I made! I picked
on you because your clothes
were biggest.”
“You’re lucky,” Gaffer
assured her. “There are some
pretty wild blokes in that
school. If any of them had got
to meet you, you would have
been in real danger.”
“But I think you’re all right,”
May said, coming close to him.
“Yes, you’re safe with me,"
Gaffer said.
He let the arm he’d had
along the back of the seat rest
tentatively across her shoulders.
May turned and stared at
him. At last she relaxed ; he
was beginning to make sense.
She gave a couple of wriggles
that brought them still closer.
Presently she said, “Do we
have to stay here right under
the light?”
“I don’t suppose we do,”
Gaffer agreed heavily.
But he grabbed her arm
fiercely as she led the way
along.
“It was the letters that did
it,” he said.
But May was no 1 longer
interested in the letters.

FIVE DAYS OLD
[FOR Christopger.]
Christmas is in the air.
You are given into my hands
Out of quietest, loneliest lands.
My trembling is all my prayer.
To blown straw was given
All the fullness of Heaven.
The tiny, not'the immense
Will teach our groping eyes.
So the absorbed skies
Bleed stars of innocence.
So cloud-voice in war and trouble
Is at last Christ in the stable.
Now wonderingly engrossed
In your fearless delicacies,
I am launched upon sacred seas.
Humbly and utterly lost
In the mystery of creation,
Bells, bells of ocean.
Too pure for my tongue to praise,
That sober, exquisite yawn
Or the gradual, generous dawn
At an eyelid, maker of days:
To shrive my thought for perfection
I must breathe old tempests of action
For the snowflake and face of love,
Windfall and word of truth,
Honor close to death.
O eternal truthfulness, Dove,
Tell me what I hold —
Myrrh? Frankincense? Gold?
If this is man, then the danger
And fear are as lights of the inn,
Faint and remote as sin
Out here by the manger.
In the sleeping, weeping weather
We shall all kneel down together... '

DOVES IN THE SHEOAKS
[Tune: “Shenandoah”]
In failing sun the doves deliver
Drowsy song across the sheoaks;
Through the half-light they deliver
Irony to wakeful hearts
Under fretted branches.
Such ironies the woods have offered
Trespassers whom shade and bird-song
Led to acts that never offered
In the city’s proper shade
Or the straggling suburb.
Of innocents beneath green laurel,
Brynhild in the bed of honor,
Daphne turned to a green laurel,
Now the canny birds of peace
Tune their quiet throbbing.
Romantic song is darkly pleasing;
Gifts of peace when faintly haunted
Will gather shadows and prove pleasing
To a dreamer and his words
In the pearly twilight.
Observe a world of changing image —
Banksia, tea-tree, gum and sheoak —
Hides a pressing mother-image
And those furtive ghosts a child
Sighted, fled and wept at.
At the last the doves are singing
Through the branches, not in sorrow
Or madness, but for love of singing:
Singing of love and easily
Strumming our involvement.

SPRINGTIDE
After the springtide is the very low slack;
A long drawing back of water. All that
Seemed harbor-like is a mud-flat, black
With its wet mud, and its drowned cat.
Oh, come in, springtide, though low-water
is known
■ —Even the ocean is disappointing to the
middle-aged.
Such years want a tidal-wave. Too much
is known
And unknown. The trivial thought is
staged.
It’s the unreal, then, is real: giant waves
Washing over mountains . . . incongruous
detail
Out of tubs of ale. Mind craves
That which only heart may have; knows
it must fail.
Oh, come in, springtide, highwater is
known
And the heart’s slack, below which love
must drown. -

What good is an old man to the sea ?
Gone, gone is death by water.
World is what a ship is. Only
Death can be as lonely.
An old man calls an old boat ship,
Paints it a brave sun-dancing yellow.
World is what a ship is. Only
World can be as lonely.
Death on the water is a thing
Different from death by drowning . . .
Fire and air turn enemies. Only
Man can be as lonely.
An old man on the sea at night
Lost, gone the glow of yellow.
Life is what the eye sees. Only
Life can be as lonely.
An old man moving with the tide
Lights a rag of fire on water.
Hand is what a man is. Only
Man can be as lonely,
For flame could echo, call a flame —■
Image is answer and not drowning.
Man is what his flesh is, lonely.
Man is that thing only.
And old men on the sea at night
Light a fire to be seen and saved,
Leastways be warm and seeing; that’s to
Live and not be lonely.
Only old men have shaky hands.
Captains never turn to water.
Drink is what the sea is; bravely,
Captains drink bright yellow.
But what’s an old man to the sea ?
Fire can spill like oil or water.
Quick is what a fire is. Only,
Man can be so lonely
That elements will scorch and sting —
Air and water, earth and yellow.
Alien as firelight lonely,
Death is that fact only.
Old man, old man, all gone, all gone.
Old to live and live for drowning —
Yellow charred wood, lonely,
Touching the wide sea, only.

HEAR THE BIRD OF DAY
Hear, the bird of day
Stirs in his blue tree,
Fumbles for words to say
The things a bird may learn
From brooding half the night.
What’s matter but a hardening of the

Out of this seed of song
Discoursing with the dark,
Now in a clear tongue
Rises his lonely voice.
And all the east is bright.
What’s matter but a hardening of the

Mountain and brilliant bird,
The ram and the wren,
For each there is a word ;
In every grain of satid
Stands a singer in white.
What’s matter but a hardening of the

THE MURDER OF KENNEDY, 1848
Jackey Jackey, crazed with love,
Kissed cold Kennedy to death.
“I care not for these spears, my boy,”
Said Kennedy and gasped for breath.
The bleak ice-flowers about him grew,
The jungle soughed and sighed,
The python stilled its eerie bulk
As Kennedy died.
Nature has neither love nor hate
For any but its own:
Cape York trembled for Jackey Jackey
Left in life alone.
To be in life alone, and love,
To live in love when old,
Exploring for that inward thing
When the outer love is cold,
Ah, that the jungle sensed, and cared,
As Jackey Jackey cried.
The jungle killed and loved as well
When Kennedy died.

OUR BIGGEST BUSINESS
AFTER 102 years in business the
N.S.W. Railways are still the big-
gest concern operating in Australia, with
a capital-expenditure figure of £260
million, earnings (last year) of £79
million, and a net loss (after paying
interest and sinking-fund contributions)
of £5.8 million.
Summarising the year’s work at the
beginning of his report for 1956-57,
Commissioner Neal McCusker gives the
following figures, which convey some
idea of the scale of his department’s
activities:
Goods and Livestock:
Tons of freight carried .. .. 18,790,783
Ton-miles .. 7,781,239,642
Train-miles 14,711,817
Revenue £51,955,566
Revenue per train-mile .. £3 10s. Bd.
Coaching :
Passengers carried 263,136,494
Train-miles 22,318,547
Revenue £22,849,977
Revenue per train-mile .. £1 os. 6d.
At the end of June last year the depart-
ment had 1217 locomotives in service
(1139 steam; 30 electric; 48 diesel-
electric), 26,458 goods-wagons and -vans,
2973 passenger-carriages and 1011 service-
vehicles. This rolling-stock operated on a
network of 6103 miles of track, and the
average number of staff employed dur-
ing the year was 54,808, with an average
annual pay of £993—a payroll of over
£1 million a week!
The report shows that earnings for
the year totalled £78,688,602, which was
£3,302,496 more than in the previous year.
Most of the increase came from passenger
traffic, fares having been raised during
the year. Even so, passenger-revenue
fell below the estimate to the tune of
£2,115,023, the departmental calculators
having apparently not attached sufficient
importance to warnings that higher fares
would mean a decline in patronage.
Revenue from goods-traffic was also
below the figure estimated, though not
greatly so. In some important classes
of goods—steel, cement and wool —the
quantities handled were greater than in
1955-56, but the improvement was not
enough “to overcome the failure of the
major revenue-producing items of coal,
livestock and wheat to achieve estimates.
Wheat moved was less than during
1955-56 by 12,574,545 bushels, due to
partial failure of the last season’s crop.”
This comment is a grim reminder of the
effect of bad seasons on the depart-
ment’s revenue; the wheat figures, poor
in the period under review, will be far
worse in the 1957-58 accounts.
Revenue from wheat, livestock, coal
and coke account for about 30 per cent,
of railway revenue, and the report
remarks that “the commissioning of new
major power-stations in close proximity
to coalmines had a marked effect on the
total tonnage of coal hauled by rail,
and it is expected that the trend will
continue.”
The importance of goods-traffic to the
railways is shown by the fact that it
brings in 66 per cent, of the total revenue,
although it accounts for only 40 per cent,
of the train-miles run. Coaching-traffic
(the term still employed to describe the
carriage of passengers) yields only 29
per cent, of the revenue, while account-
ing for 60 per cent, of the train-miles
run. This is something that should be
borne in mind in any criticism of rail-
fares.
Some idea of the scope of the depart-
ment’s activities can be gained from the
information that every day of the year
some 30 “through” freight-trains and
over 800 “local” freight-trains are
operated. In addition, more than 200
country passenger-trains are scheduled
daily, and on every weekday approxi-
mately 1300 multiple-unit trains run into
and out of Sydney.
If there is such a thing as an average
locomotive, in the sense in which we
use the term average man, then Mr.
McCusker’s average loco, travelled 30,428
miles last year, hauling trains carrying
15,440 tons of goods and 216,217
passengers.
Road Competition
HPHE commissioner’s report puts the
case for the railways as against the
road-hauliers rather better than it has
generally been stated. It points-out that
policy during the hundred-and-two years
of railway-development in N.S.W. has
been along the lines of freight-rating
designed to assist primary and secondary
industry, and with rates based on a
tapering scale to ease costs to people in
more remote parts.
In many cases goods for primary
industry have been carried at or under
cost, as a matter of Government policy.
Similar concessions have applied to
primary products railed to the seaboard
and points of manufacture. As a result,
other classes of goods in a manufactured
state have had to carry a relatively higher
freight-rate to offset the burden of traffic
carried at uneconomical rates. The great
bulk of goods are carried to and from
the primary and mining industries.
This policy has been reasonably suc-
cessful until recent years, but, following
on the intensive operation of road-
transport, it has been found that much
of the higher-rated traffic has been lost
by the railways, mainly because road-
operators are usually not classified as
common carriers and are therefore in a
position to select only those classes of
traffic which give a highly-profitable return.
On the other hand, this department is not
in a position to decline to accept any
particular type of traffic and is therefore
compelled to handle all business which is
1 unattractive to road-hauliers.
This question of the extent to which
State-owned railways should be asked to
subsidise primary industry and remote
areas has always been a vexed one. For
many years the N.S.W. Government has
made a contribution to railway revenue
towards meeting losses on developmental
lines. This payment (£1 million last year)
is an arbitrary figure, and if the railways
are to be run as a business proposition
there is a strong argument for a tnorough
overhaul of all freight-schedules. It
should be possible to devise a system
under which the railways are credited
with full freight on all goods carried ;
any subsidising that may be necessary
should be done through a development-
account. The end-result for the Govern-
ment would be the same and the railways’
accounts would show a fairer picture of
the year’s operations.
Real Estate
TN his search for additional revenue the
commissioner plans to turn to better
account much of the department’s surplus
railway land ; in particular, to follow a
trend noted in countries overseas to
utilise the air-space above the tracks near
railway-stations. An example of this is
the intended erection of a large budding
for car-parking over the tracks in the
Elizabeth and Goulburn Streets area of
the Sydney City Railway.
At Hurstville station plans provide for
an eight-story building spanning the
present platforms. It will have a length
of 520 ft., will be 220 ft. wide and will
rise 125 ft. above rail-level. This will pro-
vide accommodation for car-parking,
offices, shops and other facilities. Similar
proposals are in mind for Chatswood,
Bankstown, Hornsby, St. Leonards, Fair-
field and several other suburban stat.ons.
On the expenditure side it is hoped
that with the introduction of additional
diesel-electric locomotives, the electrifi-
cation of the western line to Lithgow and
the building of improved types of bogie
rolling-stock, speedier and more economi-
cal transport will be provided, which in
turn will attract more goods and revenue.
Modifications proposed for Enfield yards
will, says the report, double its truck-
handling capacity and as the year ended
the question of introducing mechanised
accounting methods into the service was
being studied. Other moves being con-
sidered included more economical
methods of track-maintenance, moderni-
sation of rolling-stock, the handling of
highway-trailers by rail and the reorgani-
sation of unprofitable services.
The N.S.W. Railways have lost a lot of
money in recent years and have been
handicapped considerably by Govern-
ment policy, but it is pleasing to read
that the commissioner intends to secure
“increased efficiency and more business,”
and that the problem of “maintaining
operating-expenses in proper relationship
to gross revenue is being kept under con-
stant review.”


SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Sydney Racing
Gold Stakes, one of the most
brilliant sprinters in Australia
today, probably galloped his
way into a Brisbane visit by his
easy win in Rosehill’s Flying
Handicap. Actually, apart from
Heroic Victory (second), the
opposition was weak. Punters
who secured 7 to 4 about his
chance were in luck’s way
because before the meeting
began Gold Stakes was regarded
as one of the prime bets of the
afternoon. However, in the face
of strong support for Heroic
Victory, and for Redbank
(33’s to s’s), Gold Stakes eased
from even money to his start-
ing-price of 7 to 4. Redbank
should be hard to beat in any
Welter to 7\ furlongs.
Among Saint Warden’s wins
were the 1943 Caulfield Cup—-
the year the race was run in
divisions and the Port
Adelaide Cup (twice). That
stayer appears in the blood-
lines of Royal Pastime, whose
first success (A.J.C. Two-year-
old Graduation Stakes) was
confidently expected by his
owner, G. H. Niblett, and
trainer, Gordon Brown, of
Murray Stream fame. The
gelding had previously shown
promise in races and had also
shown winning trials at Rose-
bery. He is by Royal Blue
(imp.) from Pasticcio, and cost
450gns. as a yearling.
Randwick trainer C. B.
(Baden) Hasler won a double at
the Anzac Day meeting at
Randwick with outsider Ida
Blue and the well-fancied Lord
Cynara. The stable went close
to making it a treble when
Fantasy, another “roughie,”
finished third to Royal Pastime
and Murchison. Fantasy had
run last in Bold Colleen’s race,
also at Randwick, the previous
Saturday, when she was well
fancied. Ida Blue also had
shaped poorly at her prior out-
ing, but Lord Cynara had
finished a promising sixth to
Zaheida six days before easily
defeating Dipso and Medallion
in the A.J.C. Gallipoli Welter.

When favorites or near-
favorites win all five jackpot
races the return is bound to be
small. This happened at Rose-
hill when 691 investors picked
the right five, each receiving a
dividend of £75 12s. 6d. With
a carryover of £17,958 there
was a target for jackpot-
hunters, and, though the crowd
was given as 21,500 only, the
P°°|l reached £5l 982 No
some of the larger
jesters lost heavily on the
f ea ’ as three favorites and
two second-favorites won the
money. As things turned out
wou have paid bigger
P unt ers to have placed their
with bookmakers, but
at s ,after-talk. One rank
outsider in five would have
a lot of difterence to the
dividend. The fielders had
one their worst days for
months.
The T. J. Smith stable won
a double at Rosehill with Great
Blaze (First Parramatta Stakes)
and Irish Folly (Two-year-old
“But, dammit, my trainer TOLD me I was fighting at
9.13, not 13.9!“
Handicap). Both were short-
priced favorites and on form
looked winners. Great Blaze
has won at two of his last four
starts and will now go into
open company. He had a close
call over Huaview, which was
a little slow from the barrier,
and Loquendi, who didn’t
appear to be suited by the soft
track but finished on well over
the final furlong. Great Blaze
won by a nose! He is by
Doughboy (imp.) from Field
of Mons and is a strongly built
three-year-old. When the new
season comes round he should
do well in his age-group and
against the older brigade.
Irish Folly, winner of the
Two-year-old Handicap on
Saturday, is by the Hyperion
stallion Rolled Gold (imp.)
from Irish Eyes (imp.) by
Blue Peter from Sun Princess
by Solario. The colt is directly
descended from Mumtaz Mahal
through Sun Princess, while
another in the background,
Lucky Bag (imp.), is sire of
Monte Carlo and Slogan 11.
Nasrullah, another notable in
the pedigree, was champion sire
in England in 1951 and in the
U.S. in 1955. Rolled Gold has
sired the winners of many
N.Z. events. He belongs to the
family which produced Meld,
who won £43,051, including the
English Oaks and St. Leger.
Star Revue, winner of a
number of races away from the
city area, showed his best
metropolitan form when he
cleared out with the Second
Parramatta Stakes at Rosehill,
the display being a sharp
improvement on his prior run
at Canterbury. He was slow
off the mark on that occasion,
but at Rosehill he quickly took
the lead, and thereafter it was
a case of follow-the-leader.
At one stage Star Revue was
half-a-dozen lengths ahead of
his nearest rival, and he won
by three lengths in the slow
time of 1.275, an indication of
the heavy track. A five-year-
old gelding by Elysium (imp.)
from Starway, Star Revue can
win one more race in the
Graduation class.
• • • •
Horses rarely race on succes-
sive days, especially over
middle distances, but Prince
Dante not only did this but he
won the second time —the
Rosehill Handicap. On Anzac
Day at Randwick he showed a
lot of pace, then weakened into
second place, in the Malaya
Handicap. Both races were run
at a mile-and-a-quarter. In the
Rosehill Handicap, Prince
Dante was slow to get going,
but quickly took the lead and
wasn’t again headed. Jack’s
Count and Saltillo filled the
minor places. Prince Dante
hadn’t won a race for close
on two years.
A confident plunge was
landed in the final Rosehill
event, the Welter, when the
locally trained Gentle Lu,
backed from 11-to-2 to 5-to-2
and closely pressing the
favorite, Achnacary, won in the
final few strides from that
horse, with Blackwood third.
Gentle Lu had also accepted
for the Flying Handicap, but
the stable preferred the easier
race, in which her handicap of
9.2 was reduced to 8.9 through
J. Hampton’s allowance-claim
of 71b. Thus Gentle Lu
figured 91b. above the limit
and she was well in when
handicaps were analysed. This
factor also was a determining
pointer in switching her from the
Flying. Anyway, she wouldn’t
have beaten Gold Stakes in
that race. It was the mare’s
third run after a spell and now
she has struck form she
should go on to further success.
• • • ,#
Praetorian, winner of the
Rosehill Auburn Stakes, had
also won at his prior start and
had been placed in other races.
His success kept going the win-
ning run of owner Ezra
Norton, whose colors have
been kept well to the fore by
Straight Draw, Theodric and
Praetorian. Pardorus came
from the rear of the field for
second money. He could soon
win his first race.

There may soon be two
Sydney trainers named O’Sul-
livan. There is already one,
Leo, who prepares a smart team
of gallopers at Rosebery, and
the other could be Jack, who
has been a prominent jockey
for about 25 years. Leo has
had a lot of success in recent
years with Teranyan, New
Spec and Gay Port, all of
which should win plenty more
races —in Brisbane, for a start.
In earlier years he won the
Moonee Valley Cup in suc-
cessive years, 1939-40, with
Oliver Triggs’s Gilltown.
• • • •
Jack O’Sullivan will be
remembered for his successes
as a top apprentice. Before
completing his indentures he
won the 1933 Melbourne Cup
on Hall Mark, and the same


season’s A.J.C. Metropolitan
Handicap on Regal Son. He
has now handed his jockey’s
licence to the A.J.C. and has
applied for a trainer’s ticket.
• • • •
Former crack Sydney jockey
Ted McMenamin, more
recently studmaster of Glen-
croft (Vic.), has also applied to
the A.J.C. for a trainer’s licence.
Yet another would-be trainer is
Vic Lawrence, who hasn’t met
with a great deal of success
as a jockey. It is hoped these
newcomers to the ranks will
make a successful fist of a
generally difficult business.

When Kerry Fox was sold
as a yearling at the 1955 Rand-
wick auction for lOOOgns., a
bright future was tipped for
him because of his breeding-
lines. However, not until late
in his fourth year did he win
his first race —the recent
Kembla Grange Maiden Mile.
Now that he has come good at
last he should be able to keep
the good work going. Kerry
Fox was reared at New
Zealand’s Alton Lodge stud
and was sold by Kooba stud,
Darlington Point (N.S.W.).
He is by Mid-Day Sun, who
won the English Derby in
1937.

Former Sydney gallopers
Pipes of Pan (winner) and Black
Desmond (third) shared in the
stakemoney for the West
Moreton Stakes at the Ipswich
fixture. Both have done fairly
well since they went to the
Queensland capital. Black
Desmond was formerly trained
at Roseberry by Bob Easton,
and while generally able to
show a lot of speed and make
fast time in track trials, he
was a race-disappointment in
Sydney. Pipes of Pan is
trained by G. Shelly, who also
won the Novice mile-and-a-
quarter with Jiffy’s Lad. Rac-
ing in Brisbane will now be
the chief centre of interest for
the best Melbourne and Sydney
gallopers, and southern trainers
are preparing for their visit
to the Q.T.C. and Doomben
winter fixtures.

—and Melbourne
It is not so unusual for a
horse to win at its first city
start, but not many have to
wait until they are eight years
old before having a crack at
the city gallopers. That was
the unusual feature of Pistol
Shot’s win in the Annadale
Handicap main race at
Moonee Valley last Saturday.
• • • •
Connections of Pistol Shot,
Mrs. E. F. Thompson, wife of
former champion buck-jump
rider “Snowy” Thompson, and
their son, R. A. Thompson,
must wonder why they delayed
the horse’s city debut so long.
They paid only 350gns. for
Pistol Shot, who has proved a
great money-spinner around
country meetings.

For Neil Petch’s sake, it was
good to see Timor win the first
Airport Welter at Moonee
Valley. In March, Petch set his
three star gallopers, Timor,
Astounding and Zariba, on the
way to Sydney for the A.J.C.
autumn carnival. At Goulburn,
the float carrying the horses
tumbled down an embankment.
It will be a long time, if ever,
before Zariba and Astounding
race again, but Timor has
recovered remarkably. He is
booked to go to Brisbane for
the big winter meetings. Timor
can sprint and stay a middle
distance. He could do well
in either leg of the Doomben
double—the 7-furlongs Ten
Thousand or the 11-furlongs
Cup.

This is the time of the year
when owners of moderate two-
year-olds hope to win a city
race. There are so many young
horses in that category that
the Royal Park Handicap at
Moonee Valley—a six-furlongs-
/c.y.y-20yds. event had to be
run in three heats.
It was bad luck for the
owners of the youngsters drawn
in the first division that
Planetoid was in that heat. He
cannot be described as
moderate. Although burdened
with 9.4, he went out a 9-to-2-on
favorite and won in a common
canter. Planetoid will spell in
Adelaide for the next few
months. Before he goes to the
paddock he will contest the
S.A.J.C. Sires’ Produce Stakes.
As that is a set-weight event,
he should add it to his good
record of four wins from
eight starts.
It was not surprising to see
Valtuckey score easily in the
second division of the Royal
Park. At his previous two
starts the Valbridge gelding was
placed behind good gallopers
Monasterevan and Hoogli. He
appreciated the drop in class
and had the race won at every
stage. It was a case of
beginner’s luck for Valtuckey’s
owner, R. D. Rawolle, who
has never raced a horse before.
He bought the dam Maritimus
for 350gns. and sent her to
Valbridge.
• • •
The N.Z.-bred gelding
Sumner caught the eye in this
race. Having only his second
start, Sumner, an extremely big
youngster, was not happy
around the circular track, but
he gave the impression he could
do well on a roomier course.
Not much has been seen of
Webster, who took the third
division of the Royal Park. A
leggy type of youngster, he has
been given time to mature.
This writer knows that track-
watchers at Mentone, where
Webster is trained, have a very
high opinion of the gelding’s
possibilities. It is easy to
overrate form at this time of
the year, but Webster won so
easily that he might live up to
the expectations held for him.

Weight is undoubtedly the
great leveller in racing. Before
his run in the second Airport
Welter at the Valley, Pro-
ponder had scooted away from
good-class sprint fields on
successive weeks. In those
races he carried 7.8 and 8.1.
In the Airport he was lifted
to 9.0. The class was not as
good as he had defeated so
easily, but the weight made
all the difference.
• • • •
Proponder showed his
customary speed to lead for
half the journey, but the speedy
three-year-old Foxley, carrying
only 7.11, was able to run past
him without effort. Foxley had
given notice of an early win by
running a good second to Lord
at Caulfield the previous Satur-
day. The three-year-old is by
former star miler Attley. He
won’t reach the heights his sire
scaled, but he is a useful
sprinter.
The Kismet Park Stud at
Sunbury (Vic.), developed by
the late Les Aldridge into one
of the finest bloodstock estab-
lishments in Australia, has been
bought as a going concern by
Melbourne businessman and
trotting identity A. A. Lord.
The price was not disclosed. In
the deal, Lord acquired the
stallions Empyrean and Chavey
Note, 50 brood mares, the suc-
cessful fillies Shell Pink and
La Strada, and 26 foals.
Now 14, the Hyperion horse
Empyrean has been a success
at the stud since his first
season there in 1948. His stock
have done particularly well this
season. The oldest of the
Chavey Note progeny are three.
He has been represented by four-
metropolitan winners in Mel-
bourne this season. Lord, who
has bred pacers successfully,
plans to make Kismet Park an
even finer property than it is
now.
Prominent owner W. R„
Kemball has persuaded N.Z.
rider Keith Nuttall to settle in
Melbourne. Nuttall would not
have pleasant memories of his
last visit to this country. Com-
ing here to ride Dalray in that
horse’s 1952 campaign, he won
the Metropolitan on him,
but was bitterly disappointed
when the Melbourne Cup ride
was given to Bill Williamson.
Nuttall’s N.Z. record bears out
KembalFs contention that he
is a first-class rider.
It took Reg Ansett, of
transport renown, a bare 20min.
to travel from his Mt. Eliza
property to Moonee Valley on
Saturday. He did the 30-miles
trip by helicopter. “The only
way to travel,” he told press-
men, adding with a grin, “but
I don’t suppose everybody
keeps a helicopter in the back-
yard.”
It will be a long time, if
ever, before Melbourne racing
has a jackpot tote. Last year,
the Bolte Government intro-
duced a bill to give Victoria
the jackpot, but combined
opposition from Labor, D.L.P.
and some C.P. members
defeated the measure. At the
time, the Government planned
to reintroduce the bill if it
were re-elected in May. Since
then, the jackpot tote has had
a fair trial in N. S. Wales, and
reports show that racing is no
better for it.
“P.O.M.C”: Myles Connell,
passed-on at Adelaide at 77,
ranked in his time as Aus-
tralia’s greatest jockey. In
notching 1080 winners from
5886 mounts —still Australia’s
best tally, though Neville
Sellwood’s runs it close—
Connell rode in the halcyon
days of Australian racing
against such stalwarts as Frank
Bulloch, W. H. McLachlan,
“Alby” Wood, Bobby Lewis
and, towards the end of his
career, Frank Dempsey (now
V.R.C. starter). Like McLach-
lan, who took his last race-
ride on Kennaquhair in that
champion’s last race, Connell’s
retirement coincided with that
of Chrysolaus, probably the
fastest grey ever to grace the
Australian turf.
“Bicky”: Tarrawingee race-
course, near Wangaratta (Vic.),
has never been graced by any
of the champions of the turf,
nor has it the facilities of
Caulfield or Randwick. It can
boast, however, that, apart
from Flemington and Doom-
ben, it is the only racecourse


in Australia that has a straight
six-furlongs track.

Wallabies v. N.S.W.:
Tipped to be a bit of a “grudge-
match,"’ the Wallabies v. N.S.W.
(Rugby Union), at North Sydney
Oval on Anzac Day, was hardly
willing enough to merit such a
description; still, even with the
centre a mud-patch, it was a bright
and lively game. It didn’t, how-
ever, “prove” anything.
The Wallabies won 28-6 after
leading by only 9-6 at half-time.
Despite that the Wallabies scored
six tries to none, it was an even
game. N.S.W. was not outclassed,
but the Wallabies naturally had a
great deal more combination.
The game may have turned out
more interesting had a lew more
of the “just misseds” been avail-
able lor selection for N.S.W.—but
Tooth, of course, is in England,
and Cross and Stapleton have
retired. (Some of those who played
for N.S.W. were not tour
candidates.)
The Light Blues were led by
veteran Newcastle half Cyril Burke,
who was a “just missed” lor the
recent tour; though on his form
in this game he’s lost a lot of his
snap, and would be well out of the
running lor any team to be selected
this year. Of those who were
“possibles” last year, Carroll,
Halter, Pashley and Outterside, in
the forwards, and Stanbrook, in
the backs (though he kicked poorly
for goal), played well.
Features of the game included
at least two brilliant tackles by
Wallaby centre Phelps which
stopped certain tries (and a neat
try and lovely conversion by the
same player); flying runs by the
two Wallaby wingers, Fox and
Bailey; the long passes of Wallaby
half Connor; the sureness of full-
back Curley; and the splendid
teamwork of the Wallaby pack,
-who played together as one unit
all through.
In Sydney’s Rugby Union
games, played on heavy grounds
on Saturday, Manly beat Rand-
wick 5-0, the winners’ points
coming in the first half after
centre Thomson was awarded
a controversial penalty-try;
Gordon ran over Parramatta in
the second half, 25-8; East,
with winger Browne scoring
four tries, defeated Eastwood
25-5 ; St. George had an edge
on University in a dull game
9-0; and North stopped
Drummoyne 30-3.
“J. D. A.”: Let us get the
record straight. “Nauticus”
(B. 12/2/’5B) mentions the
Rev. Mullineux’s English team
being here in 1905. It was, in
fact, 1899. “Old School Boy”
(B. 2/4/’5B) claims that Hard-
ing was captain of the 1904
side. Wrong. Bedell-Sievwright
led the 1904 tourists, who quite
correctly were billed as a
British Isles team. Harding
was a member of that combi-
nation, and came again in 1908,
this time as captain. Perhaps
“Old School Boy” is four yeats
younger than he thinks! Inci-
dentally, Sievwright, himself a
Scot, included reps, from Eng-
land, Wales, Scotland and
Ireland in his party. McEvedy
and O’Brien were Irishers. I
cannot recall any players from
Ireland who toured after that.
Harding’s team, labelled Anglo-
Welsh, was, I believe, just what
its name indicated.
“0.W.C.” also does some
correcting:
The Rev. Mullineux organised
and captained the 1898 British
Rugby Union team. In front of me
are a photograph of the team and
its programme.
They played their first match
against N.S.W. on the S.C.G.
before 22,000 spectators (1 was one
of them) and won 4-3—a beauti-
ful kick from a mark by a young
Irishman, Esmond Martelli, to a
try.
They played four Tests, losing the
first at the S.C.G., 13-3, but
winning the others, 11-0 and 11-10,
in Brisbane, and 13-0 in Sydney.
In all they played nine represen-
tative games, winning six and
losing three.
The famous Welsh centre, Gwyn
Nicholls, was the star and main-
stay of the team —probably the
finest centre Australia has ever
seen. Subsequently he played a
valiant part in the Welsh defeat of
the famous All Blacks when they
lost the oftly match of their tour
of Britain.
No British team visited Australia
in 1904. The next British team to
come here was in 1905. Both the
captain, O. R. Bedell-Sivright, and
A. F. Harding, who was a member
(but not, as has been stated,
captain), were great forwards. I
also have a photograph of this
team and its programme, both in
Australia and N.Z.
Sydney’s Rugby League had
a split round at the weekend.
On Anzac Day Manly-
Warringah, with, in particular,
grand efforts turned-in by
forwards Bull, Mean e y,
Mossop and Diversi, outplayed
Newtown 12-7; Manly was
without fullback Ron Willey,
but substitute Alan Batty- had
the better of kicking duels with
Kangaroo fullback “Punchy”
Clifford. In the other Anzac
Day game Balmain just got
there 7-5 from Parramatta,
which had been decimated by
Manly the previous round.
In Saturday’s match-of-the-
day North beat South 20-5,
after leading 17-2 at half-time ;
but it was an interesting game.
St. George easily managed East
28-3, and should have scored
“It doesn't matter WHICH chin!"
even more; and West, after
being unexpectedly down 6-12
to Canterbury at half-time,
won 15-12.
„ * „
There were two main Soccer
games in Sydney on Anzac
Day. “N.S.W.” beat “Europe”
4-3 in a Federation game at
Arlington Oval; it led 2-0 at
half-time, and went to 3-0
before the team of former
British and Continental stars
got going and made a real
game of it. In an Association
game of poor standard at
Lambert Park, “South” surpris-
ingly beat “North” 3-1;
surprising because the New-
castle-area clubs have not been
weakened by Federation
inroads, and should be the
stronger Association section.
On Saturday the visiting
Blackpool team is due to play
Australia at Sydney Sports-
ground.

The “four” after the third
V.F.L. round is Melbourne,
Collingwood, Richmond and
Fitzroy, in that order, while at
the other end South and Gee-
long have yet to win. Mel-
bourne, easing up at the end,
comfortably defeated North,
12.18-7.9, and in the other
“away” win of the round Foots-
cray broke the ice and kicked
the sweep against South,
24.14-13.18. It had been level
pegging, 8.7 each, at half-time.
Collingwood, for the second
successive week, just got there
in a home game. It had a handy
6.7-2.7 lead at half-time, but
Fitzroy kept 'it goalless in a
rugged last quarter —7.15-7.10.
Richmond always had just
enough in hand against a
battling St. Kilda, 11.11-9.14;
Carlton also broke the ice,
to defeat Geelong 18.7-9.11 —a
brilliant third quarter enabled'
the Blues to get right ahead ;
and Hawthorn beat Essendon
in a hard game, 10.14-7.6.

How does the making of sown
pasture for sheep on yellow-sand-
stone soil dijjer from tne process
on black soil ? (/ live at Bilpin,
N.S.W.)
It’s a bit hard to cover the
broad scope of your problems.
Generally, the sandstone-soils of
the Blue Mountains and adjacent
areas are acid, low in fertility and
short of molybdenum. To estab-
lish satisfactory pastures on such
soils it’s best to use generous
applications of superphosphate —at
least 2cwt.-3cwt. per acre. Also,
legume-seed (clovers) should be
inoculated with an appropriate
strain of rhizobium, and to ensure
that the rhizobia are not killed at
sowing, inoculated seed must be
sown with a 50-50 mixture of-super-
phosphate and agricultural lime, the
mixture to be prepared several weeks
before use.
To overcome molybdenum-
deficiency, without which mineral
the root-nodule bacteria (rhizobia)
will not be effective in nitrogen-
fixation, molybdenised superphos-
phate should be used. Clover-
plants not effectively nodulated are
small, yellowish and may die-out
of the pasture altogether. Inocu-
lated seed should be sown in a
moist seedbed.
Soils in the Bilpin area vary from
light sandstones to darker sand-
stones, the darker color being due
to a higher organic-matter content;
some areas of shale and basalt
soils may vary in color because of
organic-matter content. So it’s
rather tricky to determine what you
mean by "black soil.” However,
on any soils of sandstone- or shale-
origin the above technique is
recommended. On the darker
basalts lime may not be needed,
although it probably would be on
the red basalts.
Suggest you contact Mr. Darley,
District Agronomist, Department
of Agriculture, Parramatta, for
detailed advice. In the course of
his duties Mr. Darley visits the
Bilpin area and may be able to
include a visit to your property.

What materials were used to
build the Flynn Memorial Church
in Alice Springs? Was the marble
local or imported?
The blocks used for the walls
of the main structure are faced
with crushed marble rough-quarried
from the Strangway Ranges, 65
miles north-east of Alice Springs.
These building blocks were' all
made in the grounds where the
church now stands, the rough
marble being carted by bush roads
to the crushing-plant in Alice
Springs. Two types of marble,
both from local sources, have been
used: one of a creamish color,
crushed and faced on to blocks of
14 different shapes; the other of
a pink color, faced on to blocks
of five different shapes. Over
20,000 building blocks were con-
structed by hand, and no attempt
has been made to polish or adorn.
Built into the wall-structure, they
expose a thousand facets of natural-
marble chippings.
The low marble wall around the
vestry garden is built of solid
marble in random-rubble fashion.
The foundation-stone is a slab of
solid marble, with polished sur-
face; it was picked up at* random
in a creek running through the
Strangway hills. Both the com-
munion-table and baptismal font
are also made from local marble,
as are the main columns along the
north and south sides of the nave
and all the terrazzo floors.
Over 163 tons of red sandstone
quarried from the McDonnell
“She certainly put her foot down THAT time !”
..
Ranges, near Temple Bar, 13 miles
south-west of Alice Springs, have
been used in the eastern and
western shield walls and the
Pioneers’ Memorial Wall. This
stone was quarried by hand in the
nearby hills and carted in natuial
blocks to the church-site, where
rough-axing and dressing was done
by a master craftsman,

Saw that “Want” last week for
copy of a book by Simon Ocklev.
Could l have a few details of hiJ
activities ?
Simon Ockley was born at
Exeter in 1678, educated at Queen’s
College, Cambridge, became Fellow
of Jesus College and Vicar of
Swavesey, and in 1711 accepted
the position of Professor of Arabic
at Cambridge. He early maintained
that a knowledge of Oriental
literature was essential to the proper
study of theology: in the preface
to his first book, the Introductio
ad linguas orietntales (1706), Ockley
urges the importance of such study.
In 1707 he published a translation
of Leon Modena’s History of the
Present Jews Throughout the
World; the following year there
appeared The Improvement of
Human Reason, Exhibited in the
Life of Hai Ebn Yokdhan. Ockley
is chiefly known for The History
of the Saracens (1708-18); a third
volume was published post-
humously in 1757. He also trans-
lated from the Arabic the Second
Book of Esdras and the Sentences
of Ali. Ockley died on August 9,
1720. (Information from Encyclo-
pedia Brii'annica.)

(1) Did a General Malet attempt
to seize payer in France while
Napoleon was in Russia? (2) If
so, did his plot reach serious pro-
portions ? (3) Was police-chief
Joseph Fouche incriminated ?
(1) and (2) Yes. The plot, how-
ever, does not seem, at this dis-
tance, to have had much backing
or much real chance of success.
Many biographers of Napoleon,
such as Hilaire Bejloc and Alex-
andre Dumas, don't mention it at
all. The Encyclopaedia Britannica’s
sole comment on the affair was
tih,at it had “shown him [Napoleon]
how precarious was his position
and how much weakened his
prestige.” R. M. Wilson, in
Napoleon (1937), says: “inere was
■ a conspiracy during Napoleon’s
absence to overthrow nim—an affair
important only because it showed
how feebly his rule was seconded
and how little any of those who
represented him now believed in
his system.” John Hale’s Napoleon
(1954) states that Napoleon heard
of the plot just outside Smolensk
while the Grand Army was in
retreat from Moscow (Oct.-Nov.,
1812): “It was to be announced in
Paris that Napoleon was dead—a
rumor that was likely to be believed
because news from the front had
been 4o scanty —and Malet was to
form a provisional Government.
He gained some considerable sup-
port, jn fact, before the conspiracy
was quashed.” And R. Brice, in
The Riddle of Napoleon (1936),
says: “After Malet’s conspiracy
Napoleon was never free from a
sense of anxiety.” (3) There is no
evidence to show that he was, but
Fouche was so inscrutable and
untrustworthy that anything was
possible with him. Stefan Zweig’s
Joseph Fouche makes no reference
to his being incriminated.

In these days when Man is inclined to link his
Teachings intd space with his ideas on future travel,
it is good to see the balances in movement around
this Earth being held by the building of good ships.
I was particularly happy to learn of the
building of the new 45,000-ton P. and O. liner
“Canberra,” which in 1960 is to go on an extended
Britain-Australia-Pacific run in which the P. and O.
and Orient Lines will integrate their services.
' The establishment of this greater Pacific route
has its significance for Australia, pointing as it
does to our rising place in the commerce of the
world. And in association with that thought, we
can welcome the laying-down of this £ 15-million
vessel as one more sign of the high standard being
maintained in the building of modem ships.
The “Canberra” is being built by Messrs.
Harland and Wolff, of Belfast, from whose famous
yards many fine ships—passenger liners, merchant-
men, and warships—have gone down to the sea.
One of them was the original H.M.A.S. “Sydney,”
which sank the German raider “Emden” off Cocos
Island in the First World War.
And Australia herself is showing that she is
ready not only to live by the ships, but to build
them here to larger order. We have had the
announcement that a new 32,000-ton tanker is to be
built for a leading oil company at the Broken
Hill Proprietary shipyard at Whyalla, South
Australia. It will be the largest vessel ever built
in this country, and is expected to be the first of a
number of Australian-built super-tankers.
These developments hold a good and whole-
some promise for the future. For while I believe
I can claim to be air-minded —having done my
own share of pioneering-flying in my time—l
cannot imagine the world living and prospering, and
increasing in trade and friendship, without the
continual building of quality and strength into the
lines that thread our oceans.

"ORITISH and American
press - comment on the
Soviet’s proposal to suspend the
testing of nuclear weapons, pro-
vided the West does likewise:
“New York Times!’: “The
Soviets make their test-suspen-
sion conditional on like action
by the United States and Britain
and declare that if other
countries continue testing they
will be free to resume their
own tests. This is obviously
aimed at the [forthcoming] tests
scheduled by the United States
under foreign observation,
against which the Soviets have
already protested. These tests
are designed to perfect our own
nuclear-missile warheads, to
develop depth-charges against
the threat of the vast Soviet
submarine-fleet, to improve our
tactical atomic arms and to
develop a ‘clean bomb,’ which
can be also used for peaceful
purposes, without the fall-out
which the Soviet Tombs are
scattering.
“The Soviet reasoning is
plain. Should the United States
now cancel its tests, the Soviets
would score not only a propa-
gandistic but also a decided
military advantage. If the
United States does not cancel
its tests, as it will not, the
Soviets will cancel their own
test-suspension and blame the
United States.”
The same: “The action that
President Eisenhower calls for
is the Soviet Union’s acceptance
of measures for broad and
controlled disarmament that go
to the heart of the problem.
Addressing himself to Mr.
Khrushchev directly, the Presi-
dent asks him particularly to
accept the substance of the now
five-year-old atoms-for-peace
plan, which provides for an
internationally supervised pro-
gramme to end the production
of nuclear weapons, and to
reduce existing stockpiles. If
this is done, Mr. Eisenhower
guarantees that suspension of
nuclear tests will come
naturally.”

Jay Or ear, Associate Pro-
fessor of Physics at Columbia
( U.S.A.) University, in a letter
to “N.Y. Times” : “Our [U.S.]
State Department should be
embarrassed to accuse the
Russians of going ahead on the
test-ban without inspection.
Russia has a standing offer,
first announced at the U.N.
disarmament talks in London
on June 14, 1957, to sign a test-
ban agreement which should ‘be
implemented by scientific
control-posts to be set-up in
the United States, U.S.S.R.,
United Kingdom and Pacific
Ocean areas.’ With these addi-
tional inspection-stations we
could even detect very low-yield
explosions and deep under-
ground tests.
“This was the original United
States plan which was presented
by Harold Stassen. Shortly
after the Russian acceptance
we changed our minds and
insisted on a full-scale inspec-
tion-system of all Russian
classified areas where bombs
could be produced.”
The same: “I would advocate
as the first step in reversing
the fatal direction of our
[U.S.] foreign policy that we
accept the Soviet offer of a
test-ban agreement with internal
inspection-stations. If Russia
balks, then we finally will have
won the propaganda battle ; if
she agrees, then we all will
have won something much
more important.”

C. L. Sulzberger in “N: Y.
Times’’: “At the moment only
the United States and Russia
have a balanced arsenal of
atomic arms, Britain is a
junior member of this club.
France is on the verge of join-
ing. West Germany apparently
will not long lag behind.
“The industrial system of the
Nato world, therefore, is in
a far better posture to begin
producing the hideous weapons
of our age than is the industrial
system of the Soviet bloc,
France, Germany, Italy, Bel-
gium and such sympathetic if
non-allied lands as Sweden and
Switzerland are approaching a
capability of nuclear fabrica-
tion.
“Were they all to get into
the atomic business the vast
lead of the U.S.S.R. in terms of
manpower and conventional
military force would begin to
fade. The only way in which
a Communist edge could be
maintained would be by
encouraging such nations as
China, Poland, Czechoslovakia
and Hungary to start nuclear
fabrication.
“But this involves an
immense political risk. Moscow
is apparently not anxious to
push China into the atomic
club. Nor do the Chinese yet
have an adequate manufae-'
taring and financial base.

Poland and Hungary armed
with super-weapons. But the
United States entertains no
such reluctance. We have no
allies so unsteady and so un-
trustworthy as are Moscow’s
satellites Hungary and Poland.”
* # *
London “Observer” : “In
real terms it [the Russian pro-
posal] means nothing mdre than
that the Soviet Government has
completed a big series of tests
and for the present is content
to conduct no more. The
stockpiles and continued manu-
facture of nuclear weapons, and
the policies for their contingent
use, are quite unaffected. And
those, of course, are the things
that matter.”
The same : “Mr. Khrushchev
said that he is ready to accept
international supervision, if this
would persuade the United
States and Britain to hait
further explosions. There is
every reason why the Western
Powers should call Mr. Khrush-
chev’s bluff. They should reply
that they are delighted by the
Russian offer and are also
prepared to suspend tests while
the United Nations is asked
to devise some system of inter-
national inspection to make
sure the suspension is observed.
Such a system would probably
require a grid of monitoring
stations some 1000’ miles apart
all over the world, and soyne of
these, of course, would have
to be stationed in the Soviet
Union. Such a system might
not detect all bomb-tests, but
it would almost certainly detect
the big ones those in the
megaton range. If Russia
refused to accept such a
system or declared it to be un-
necessary, then clearly the
Western Powers wouLd be free
to reconsider their position.”

London “Daily Telegraph ” .*
“Mr. Gromyko’s speech can be
very easily interpreted: ‘Our
scientists are happy for the
moment; yours must stop dead
in their tracks.’ The first deduc-
tion is that the Russians fancy
they lead in the technique of
these ghastly weapons: the
second that they no longer
believe, as Mr. Molotov used to
contend, that they would be
relatively scatheless in a nuclear
war.”
The same: “We can be
certain that British gestures of
unilateral disarmament or
suspension of tests, such as
have been proposed, here [in
Britain], 'would have little or
no effect on the Americans, with

fheir memories of what conven-

We should do best to resign
ourselves to sitting-out a long
diplomatic duel between
Moscow and Washington over
the future of nuclear weapons,
for it is obvious that on this
question, if not on others, Mr.
Khrushchev is interested mainly
in direct exchanges with Mr.
Eisenhower. The President has
often recently incurred criti-
cism, but the commonsense
which he showed so often
during the war will surely
prevent him from being gulled.”
* * •
London “News Chronicle ’’:
“The insincerity of the
Kremlin may be presumed but
that does not excuse the
democracies of their duty of
trying to break the disarmament
deadlock and checking the
perilous sequence of nuclear
tests. The political price among
the uncommitted nations will
be very high if London, Paris
and Washington show them-
selves unwilling to take-up any
Russian proposals which offer
even a glimmer of hope.”
The same: “President Eisen-
hower’s reply to the Russian
Government is a great improve-
ment on some recent Western
statements. It recalls the
American initiatives for the
peaceful use of the atom which
the Kremlin, for all its talk,
has disregarded and ends by
reminding Mr. Khrushchev of
the practical proposal endorsed
by the United Nations General
Assembly. This is that tech-
nicians on both sides should
meet to discuss the details, of
disarmament control. Any
agreements they might come to
would not bind the Govern-
ments concerned but they would
provide the blueprint for
inspection and control without
which talk of disarmament is
only delusion.”

London “Economist ” : “If
western scientists want to go
on with their explosions, they
will have to produce some very
convincing reasons. But if all
the different kinds of nuclear
weapon that scientists want to
try-out are multiplied by all
the different countries which
will sooner or later be able to
conduct tests, there will never
be a spare half-minute in which
someone Is no! saying, *Jus! let
me have my bang before we
all stop.* The main criterion is
a simple one. If the West
forgoes its next batch of tests,
will it really be in danger of
losing its deterrent power? If
so, the tests must go on; but
if not —and it is difficult to
•believe the deterrent would
evaporate if the forthcoming
explosions did not take place—
the West’s next move should be
to offer to give-up its own
tests under a reasonable system
of inspection.”
Khrushchev
“Manchester Guardian”
editorial assessment of the
supreme dictator of the
U.S.S.R.:
“Now he [Khrushchev] has
turned-out Marshal Bulganin
and taken-over the Premiership,
which, together with the party-
secretaryship, puts in his hands
such a visible concentration of
power as only Stalin had held
for any length of time.
“Starting from the general
aim of making the Soviet Union
and the party ever more secure,
he [Khrushchev] has bent
Communism as a system of
ideas to every passing need.
He is indeed the master of
expedients: every few months
he comes up with a new scheme
for supplying Russia with
everything from more fodder to
a more manageable civil service
in double-quick time.
“He is what the Americans
call a ‘fixer’; and recent Soviet
foreign policy, which combines
some shrewd long-term plan-
ning with oddly skittish bursts
of activity, bears his stamp.
“Yet in all this the ‘outstand-
ing personality’ has had to
keep a jump ahead of his own
society, whose new stirrings and
aspirations he strives both to
interpret and control. There
are many signs that his own
inclination is to a cruder
manner than he has adopted:
shooting a few writers and
such, he is reported to. have
said, would have saved the
Hungarian party a lot of
trouble: it is quite in his line.
“While he was picking-off the
members of the ‘collective
leadership,’ Mr. Khrushchev
kept-up his new manner of half-
jollying, half-hectoring his
people along, like a genial
sergeant-major. His native
shrewdness may also tell him
that that is the prudent course,
even though his power now
seems unchallenged.
“Yet the history of auto-
crats shows time and again
how they are moved away from
prudence by the exercise of
power and the constant
endeavor to preserve it. Mr.
Khrushchev may come to stand
out for darker characteristics
than knowing how to keep
afloat.”
The Refugee Problem
Prompted by the suggestion
by a group of young British
Conservatives that there should
be a World Refugee Year on
N.Y. “Herald Tribune”
ALL SET FOR A REST, IF
something the same scale as
the World Geophysical Year,
Norman Bentwich, writing in
London “Time and Tide,”
notes some fresh efforts which
must yet be added to the con-
siderable good work already
done.
Bentwich, who was Attorney-
General in Palestine from
1920-31, and of
International Relations at
Jerusalem University from
1932-51, the inter-
national problem of refugees
since 1921, when the League of
Nations appointed Dr. Nansen
as High Commissioner for
Russian Refugees to cope with
the flood of two-million out-
casts from Soviet Russia. There
were various high commis-
sioners and committees for
various refugee problems until
the International Refugee
Organisation was appointed at
the first session of the United
Nations General Assembly.
The 1.R.0. resettled over
one-million people before it was
wound-up in 1951 and its place
taken by a U.N.-appointed High
Commissioner “whose function
was to provide international
protection to all who fall within
the scope of a statute, to seek
a solution for the problem by
assisting Governments and
private organisations, and to
facilitate voluntary repatriation,
or assimilation.”
As well as the High Commis-
sioner, there were, outside U.N.,
an Intergovernmental Com-
mittee for European Migration
which was formed in 1952 and
which, in five years, resettled
about 700,000 people, of whom
one-third were refugees ; and
the U.S. Escapee Programme,
an American Government
instrument which has helped
about 150,000, of whom half
have been resettled.
The U.N. High Commis-
sioner, Bentwich notes, “was
appointed for a limited term
of years, ending in 1958—and it
was fondly hoped that by that
time he would have disposed
of the hard core of the Euro-
pean remnant, which has
languished in camps since the
end of the world war. To that
end Dr. Goedhart, Who died
last year, launched an
emergency fund for $l6 million
to provide for the emigration
and settlement of the 80,000
who remained in camps.
“He relied primarily on the


efforts of voluntary bodies,
because the Governments were
not prepared to increase their
contribution to his office and
many indeed failed to fulfil their
existing pledges. In 1955
Holland, his own country, made
a generous effort; and last year
the English societies were
marshalled by the United
Nations Association. A sum of
$400,000 was raised here
[Britain] and the camp popula-
tion had been reduced by the
beginning of last year to 50,000.
“At the present rate of pro-
gress,” Bentwich points-out,
“there would still be 30,000
at the end of 1958 ; but, if
Governments and non-govern-
mental bodies could make an
all-out effort and the countries
of immigration would respond
by opening their gates, that
remnant could be cleared-up.
It will call for a straining of
the quality of humanity to
admit the sick, crippled and
helpless among the refugees. A
few countries, notably Switzer-
land and Scandinavia, have set
an example in this direction and
Britain has done her bit; while
Israel has placed no limit to
the admission of Jewish
refugees.
“A new High Commissioner,
the Swiss Mr. August Lindt,
was appointed in December last
to succeed Dr. Goedhart. At
the last meeting of the General
Assembly of the United Nations
it was resolved that his office
should be continued for a
further five years from 1959.
He could report a remarkable
achievement with the
Hungarian refugees, who were
added to his responsibilities at
the beginning of the year. The
response of Governments and
peoples to that appeal to
humanity was in signal contrast
with the apathy towards the
residue of human wretchedness
in the old camps. They were
moved to quick and generous
action for the 200,000 who had
fled from Hungary since last
winter.
“Most of these found a first
asylum in Austria and Yugo-
slavia, but there was immediate
recognition that the burden
should not remain on the two
neighboring countries. By this
summer the great majority had
been enabled either to emigrate
overseas or to find permanent
asylum in other European
countries ; and some 8000 had
been repatriated. Moreover, the
greater part of the financial
burden . incurred by the'
countries of first asylum had
been repaid.
“The United Kingdom has an
honorable record in the action.
She admitted over 20,000,
though part of these have since
proceeded to countries of the
Commonwealth, and her people
have contributed over
£2,500,000. An equally fine
record is that of Canada, who
has admitted just on 33,000,
about the same number as the
United States has taken.
Canada has absorbed 111, and
the U.S.A. 18, for every 100,000
of her population. Voluntary
bodies, whose number is legion,
have played their part in the
action of human solidarity. The
new big refugee problem in
Europe has been solved within
a year.
“The High Commissioner for
the refugees pointed-out to the
United Nations General
Assembly that the legal pro-
tection of his office is still
required for a million refugees
who have lost their
original nationality and
have not yet acquired another.
.Naturalisation is a slow
process; and he is called-
on to see that the convention
on the status of refugees, which
has been ratified by many
States, is duly implemented.
This year it is likely that an
international conference of the
United Nations will be con-
vened to conclude a convention
for the reduction, or elimina-
tion, of statelessness. Twenty
States have declared their will-
ingness to participate in it, and
the International Law Commis-
sion of the United Nations,
which includes most eminent
legal authorities, has drafted a
convention containing original
proposals for an international
agency and an international
tribunal for the stateless. If
adopted, it would strengthen
the United Nations in matters
of human rights; for the
refugees within the mandate of
the High Commissioner are
either de jure or de facto state-
less persons.
“Two ’ vast problems of
refugees in Asia have hitherto
been outside the jurisdiction of
the High Commissioner; the
900,000 Arabs from Palestine
and the 700,000 Chinese in
Hong Kong. The work for
the millions displaced in Korea
has been completed; but the
reservoir of refugees is con-
stantly refilled. The last
General Assembly at least made
a gesture to repair the grave
lacuna in the humanitarian
effort. It declared that the
refugees in Hong Kong were a
problem of concern to the
international community and

that a High Commissioner
should use his good offices to
obtain contributions. It is
abundantly clear that the
burden of the mass-displace-
ment in Europe and Asia calls
for the largest possible measure
of human solidarity.” .
Eisenhower
It is not so long ago that the
popularity of President Eisen-
hower was such a phenomenon,
even in a hero-worshipping
land like the U.S., that
American columnists were
looking about rather bemusedly
for reasons to explain it.
Inevitably, a decline has set-in
and press-commentators who
were at a loss to explain corn-
pletely the President’s over-
whelming popularity seem to
have less difficulty in finding
reasons for the falling-off.
One partial explanation not
advanced so far is a rather
obvious one. The building-up
of popular figures by news-
papers is a common enough
practice, and one that has news-
value so lon § as th , e process
can continue. Once the plateau
is reached however, once the
adulation has been exhausted,
. one news-value
remains, and that is in the
ci iticism* the pulling-down, the
destruction of the idol.
It has become almost a
classic pattern over recent years
and is no doubt one reason
why major figures are becom-
ing increasingly Vary of news-
paper publicity or are, at least,
interposing public - relations
departments between them and
the press. The pattern does
not apply exactly and entirely
to the flow and ebb of Eisen-
hower’s career, but many of
the symptoms are there and
should no doubt be considered
along with other given reasons
for the decline in Ike's popu-
larity.
Listing some of those
other reasons, the American
correspondent of London
“Economist” notes that “the
present downturn in the [U.S.]
economy is only the latest in a
succession of unfortunate
developments for President
Eisenhower and his party”:

When Mr. R. A. Stratton was given an old Indian formula foi
the relief of Rheumatic complaints some 30 years ago, he had no
idea that one day he would be sending the Powder around the
world to relieve sufferers. “Naturally, as a strong, robust youth,
I thought little about it at the time,” said Mr. Stratton, “but in
later years I became a chronic Arthritis sufferer myself, so I had
the formula made up by a chemist and took a course of the
Powder for some months, which effected a complete cure.
“I naturally sympathised with anyone else who had been
similarly afflicted, so I decided to have the Powders prepared
in commercial quantities so I could help the numerous sufferers
from Rheumatism and Arthritis, and 1 must confess the results
have been amazing.”
When the Company started selling
the Powder its sales were limited
to this State, but, as a result of its
success, it was quickly acclaimed
a WORLD DISCOVERY and its
fame spread throughout Austral-
asia and Overseas until we now
have a world-wide clientele of
over 25,000, and we have obtained
an enviable reputation for our
ability to bring relief to all types
of RHEUMATIC COMPLAINTS.
This result, we are proud to say,
has been achieved without the use
of harmful drugs or painful injec-
tions.
One lady in South Perth who had
suffered from Rheumatism for
years and could not even open her
hands, and had been declared in-
curable, can now move her hands
quite normally, and with perfect
freedom from pain.
Another Perth lady had been a
sufferer for years and was com-
pletely crippled for 7 months out
of every 12. She sought relief in
Europe and America, had gold in-
jections and Cortizone—all to no
avail. She was advised to try the
mud baths in N.Z., and still found
no relief, yet after she had taken
a course of our Powder she was
able to go dancing. Her age was
65. This well-known Hotel Licensee
has subsequently been pleased to
recommend our Powder to numer-
ous sufferers who have long sought
a reliable remedy for the relief of
their complaints.
Recently a loyal Danish subject
who declared himself cured of
Rheumatism and Lumbago by the
use of our Powder, asked us to
send 3 cartons to King Frederick
VIII of Denmark, who suffers from
Lumbago, and we were pleased to
accede to his request. The
addresses of the above mentioned
can be seen at our Office, as well
as hundreds of original testi-
monials.
Prepared from the purest and
finest ingredients, the Powder is
a NATURAL REMEDY and NON-

DRUGS and can be taken with
perfect confidence by young and
old alike who are afflicted with
complaints of the RHEUMATIC
CROUP.
Sufferers who have had Cortizone,

relief with our proven remedy, of
whose record we are justly proud.

minor stroke last autumn con-
tributed to an impression of
waning personal vigor and the
conviction grows that this
Administration has lost its
touch.
“A year ago, during the now-
forgotten battle over the
Budget, Mr. Eisenhower still
had powerful reserves of
popular confidence in the
country upon which he might
draw to overawe his critics in
Washington; these are con-
siderably less now.
“The President’s political
popularity as measured by the
Gallup Poll has ebbed to 52
per cent., the lowest figure
since he came to office more
than five years ago. The con-
servative press has become
more critical of his Administ-
tration on important issues;
‘Time’ magazine, the bell-
wether of the Luce publica-
tions, which is influential in
forming middle-class opinion,
has attacked Mr. Eisenhower
sharply for the first time.
“At a party - meeting
Republicans in the Senate
voted, 17 to 14, to ask the
President to sign the Demo-
cratic farm-bill, an open revolt
against the Administration’s
farm policies. Mr. Eisenhower,
nevertheless, insisted on vetoing
the bill, on the grounds that,
by freezing agricultural price-
supports at present levels, it
would only make the farm-
problem more difficult to solve.
“His obstinacy in this matter
is likely to lead to other revolts
by his nominal supporters on
more vital questions, such as
tariffs and foreign aid.”
New Zealand
"Object-lesson"
A note from J. F. Wilkinson
to London “Financial Times”
on the “belly-aching from New
Zealanders to the British Press
about butter - dumping by
countries which charge their
own people high prices for the
product and sell at market-
prices (which at present are
low) on the British open
market”:
“I think that New Zealand
should first of all put her own
house in order before putting
her case for anti-dumping
measures.
“Take the case of matured
cheese; it sells in England for
Is. 6d. a pound, whereas here
in New Zealand it is 4s. New
Zealand, according to statistics,
consumes less cheese per person
than most other Western
nations, and no wonder, with
the price at 4s. a pound.
“Maybe the New Zealand
consumer pays high to help
compensate for the low prices
received on the London market.
Is this considered to be ‘dump-
ing,’ because this is exactly
what certain Continental
countries are doing with their
butter—that is, charging high
at home and selling low in
Britain?
“A similar situation arose
with frozen peas which were
sent on to the British market
and sold, according to advertise-
ments in British magazines, at
2s. 6d. per packet. This included
shipping costs, etc., but the
price here to the New Zealand
housewife was 2s. 9d.
“This air-letter [from New
Zealand to Britain] costs me
Bd., yet the same thing from
Britain would be 6d. The
difference was recently
explained in the New Zealand
press, and the reason for it is
because New Zealand internal
prices, wages, etc., are that
much higher than in Britain.
“We [New Zealand] are
paying the price of the folly
of allowing costs to rise steadily,
and now, with export-prices far
below costs of production, we
are beginning to squeal.
present position could be an
object lesson for others with
inflationary spirals.”
British Cars in the U.S.
Many and varied are the
reasons advanced for the
success of British cars in the
U.S. —in the first three days of
the New York International
Motor Show, for instance,
Britain sold over $5-million-
worth —but the terse explana-
tion by the “Kansas City
Times” would seem to have
some point:
“Now we know why there
are so many small cars (Volks-
wagens, Isettas, Hillmans,
Renaults, etc.) running around
our [America’s] streets. The
Washington correspondent of
the Paris newspaper 'Le Monde’
calls it the ‘egg-head’s revenge.’
“The fellow says that so
many thousands of Americans
have purchased the small
vehicles (sometimes called bugs)
because they want to be non-
conformists, intellectuals and
simply ‘different.’ In other
words, Americans grasp for
small cars in an otherwise
encroaching world of con-
formity.
“All of which is very interest-
ing, particularly to some egg-
heads who right along had been
thinking they bought those
small cars simply to save on
gasoline-bills.”
Various Voices
Field - Marshal Viscount
Montgomery: “The European
Test Match is postponed
indefinitely, but the village
cricket-match on the field out-
side Europe is on. The dangers
outside Europe are very great.
Russia, in my view, considers
the West is decadent, and the
whole change of Soviet foreign
policy is directed towards
accelerating what they think is
a decline of the West. We now
face an economic and financial
war which is directed at the
very foundations of our
civilisation.”
Marshal of the R.A.F. Sir
Dermot Boyle, Chief of Air
Staff: “Because the R.A.F. is
young enough for many of us
to remember its early days—
when to fly across the oceans
or to climb above 25,000 ft. was
an adventure —we may some-
times be accused of living in
the past. Nothing could be
farther from the truth. Today
and in the future the R.A.F. has
a role to play as vital as at any
time in its history.”


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Mail Deliveries
It is noted that in B. 9/4/’5B
a member of the public, signing
himself “Ex-ACT”, has com-
mented on the present slow
delivery of mail, and has made
certain statements in relation to
members of my organisation.
It appears to me that “Ex-
ACT” is a person who assumes
his own solution, and, having
considered it once, is then quite
convinced by his own explana-
tion. If he would only take the
trouble to find-out the facts,
such letters as that published in
your journal would not appear.
The main cause of the
delay in mail-deliveries in
Sydney is that the present
G.P.O. is hopelessly out-of-
date and unable to cope with
the amount of traffic which is
flowing in ever-increasing
quantities. Steps have been
taken by the department to
rearrange the number of men
on duty over a period of 24
hours, which the G.P.O. mail-
staff works in an endeavor to
shift the mail as speedily as
possible. However, no amount
of alterations to staff-rosters or
installations of new machines
will overcome the main factor,
and that is that the building
cannot cope with the traffic.
A site for a new mail-branch
capable of handling letter-
traffic was obtained at Redfern
a number of years ago and
has been included on the build-
ing estimates for the Post-
master-General’s Department
ever since. However, on each
occasion some cut is made in
the allocation of money for
capital-works, and the Sydney
Mail Branch is the item which
is inevitably deleted from the
list. This has occurred again
this year with the result that
this union was forced to bring
the matter to the notice of the
public so that the Government
would take definite steps to
provide an up-to-date, efficient
service in the handling of mails
in Sydney.
In relation to the last para-
graph of “Ex-ACFs” letter, I
would inform him that the
postal-workers he mentioned,
namely the sorters and post-
men, in addition to a number
of our other members, have
a very strong grievance in so far
as they are kept on rates of
pay which are little above the
basic wage paid in New South
Wales. They are not subject to
automatic adjustments as are
workers under State legislation.
Finally, a publicised protest
was made by members of this
organisation in September,
1956, to bring their parlous
wage-situation to the notice of
the public and since then the
matter has twice been taken to
“the tribunal established at
high cost’’ with no result what-
soever, the decision given being
on grounds that the Federal
basic wage is frozen, and no
relief is available to members
of The Amalgamated Postal
Workers’ Union.
Members of this organisation
over the years have been
commended by officers of the
department, the general public
and the Government, for the
magnificent service they give
in times of trouble, such as fire,
flood, etc., and that spirit has
been maintained despite the fact
that little thought has been
given by the Government or the
department to the low rates of
pay received by Our members.
Therefore, “Ex-ACT” and
other members of the public
should commend the sorters
and postmen rather than
condemn them. —C. J. J.
McGrane, general secretary-
treasurer, Amalgamated Postal
Workers’ Union of Australia
(N.S.W.).
White Australia
Although anti-Chinese feel-
ing on the goldfields in the
1850’s may have resulted in a
demand for a “White Aus-
tralia” policy (B. 9/4/’5B) the
original idea can be traced
back to John Pascoe Fawkner
in 1840.
Mercurial, egotistically
determined, and fiery of speech
on occasion, Fawkner, an
editor of the “Port Phillip
Patriot and Melbourne Adver-
tiser,” campaigned in his
columns for a betterment of
conditions in the settlement.
When Melbourne was only
three years old he demanded
that a police-force and law-
courts be established. The
following year he penned
urgent demands for harbor-
works, a water-supply system
and, of all things, a lunatic
asylum.
“This is truly liberty,” he
wrote, “where freeborn men
having to advise the public
may speak free.” And freely
he spoke, denouncing the local
maltreatment of aborigines
“This the Cold Coast ?”
while paradoxically demanding
that consideration be given to
making this country a “White
Australia.” Fawkner’s was
possibly the first statement of
belief in such a need. —L.J.B.
(Vic.).
Aircraft Purchases
What determines Australia’s
choice of industrial products—
quality or politics?
Two Australian airlines have
now, it seems, been refused
permission to buy the aircraft
of their choice for post-1958
needs: the Government (which
knows best, of course!) has
“prescribed” products of an
English company (following a
visit of the managing-director).
All of which makes you
wonder. But this is how the
London “Times” puts it:
“Certainly the (Australian)
Government’s decision is
regarded here as a great fillip
to British industry. It is inter-
preted as making it clear to
two domestic airlines that they
are not going to be allowed to
pioneer two new foreign air-
craft.”
This in a time of boasted
“technological development and
free enterprise.” Does the Au-
stralian public just accept it:
no more pioneering? And
because the status quo is safer?
Or because of business?—
R. George Overend (Eng.).
Pepys, Lindsay and
Stevenson
By chance I had just read
Stevenson’s essay on Samuel
Pepys (Familiar Studies of Men
and Books by R.L.S., Caledonia
Edition) when B. 26 / 3/’5 8
came to hand containing
Norman Lindsay’s article. I
have failed to find any evidence
that Stevenson neglected “to
separate the Pepys scribbling
in his diary from the dignified
Pepys, Secretary to the Navy
Office.” Indeed, several pages
(pp. 233-4) seem entirely to
belie this accusation:
The greatness of his life was
open, yet he longed to communi-
cate its smallness also. . . .
Now, if ever, we should be
able to form some notion of that
unparalleled figure in the annals

of mankind—unparalleled for three
good reasons: first, because he was
the man known to his contem-
poraries in a halo of almost his-
torical pomp, and to his remote
descendants with an indecent
familiarity, like a tap-room com-
rade ; second, because he has out-
stripped all competitors in the art
or virtue of a conscious honesty;
and, third, because, being in many
ways a very ordinary person, he
has yet placed himself before the
public eye with such a fullness and
such an intimacy of detail as might
be envied by a genius like Mon-
taigne. Not then for his own sake
only, but as a character in a unique
position, endowed with a unique
talent, and shedding a unique light
upon the lives of the mass of man-
kind, he is surely worthy of
prolonged and patient study.
Stevenson did call Pepys a
“cock-boat,” but only in rela-
tion to one event, the Stuart
Restoration of 1660, when
Pepys was a minor official aged
27. “Round went the whole
fleet of England on the other
tack ; and while a few tall
pintas, Milton or Pen, still
sailed a lonely course by the
stars and their own private
compass, the cock-boats, Pepys,
must go about with the majority
among the stupid starers and
the loud huzzas.”
After all, Pepys at 27
was a very minor figure
in the State —only a cock-boat
indeed, figuratively speaking.
' Finally, surely Stevenson is
remembered for other things
than for being a “self-idolater.”
A writer who wrote so feelingly
and so tellingly in defence of
the heroic yet maligned Damien
of Molokai merits at least that
one lance should be raised in
his own defence, even against
such a distinguished fellow of
his race as Norman Lindsay,
who has, to my mind, marred
a remarkable essay on Pepys by
a needless paragraph on
Stevenson. Martin Haley

Reciprocity
There’s still plenty of scope
for more reciprocity between
nations within the Common-
wealth set-up. Our Public
Service Act continues to
ostracise returned soldiers of
sister-nations in the matter of
certain examination - exemp-
tions. The P.M.G. recently
made it clear that in the post-
office service-exemption was
“Fair go, mister, I’m not one of them Noo Orsetralians.”
only applicable to Australian
returned men.
My excellent New Australian
neighbor, ex-Indian Army,
promptly resigned the Aus-
tralian R.S.L. when so advised.
Cocuswood. (N.S.W.).
Wharfside Intransigence
Because of the falling-off in
tonnage handled and the instal-
lation of bulk-handling equip-
ment, Gladstone (Q.) has been
reclassified from an A- to a
B-class port. Thus the ship-
owners no longer have to pay
appearance-money. Following
the reclassification the wharfies
canvassed the business-houses
of the town, seeking support
for their claim for reinstate-
ment of Gladstone as an A-
class port. There was a
measure of sympathy for them.
Then the port of Rockhamp-
ton was flooded and two ships
had to be diverted to Glad-
stone. One, the freighter North
Esk, had 600 tons of steel to
discharge. The wharfies
decided, on a point of policy,
not to unload the cargo except
on their own terms —this no
doubt dictated by some
southern union-boss. As a
result the wharfies received no
pay and the steel stayed in the
ship’s hold, with financial loss
to all parties concerned.
What help can these men
expect? They allow them-
selves to be persuaded into
action which will not only
annul their claims for the
reclassification of Gladstone to
its previous status, but
also allow the opportunity of
earning some much-needed
cash to slip through their
fingers.—E.A.D. (Q.).
The Color Question
A columnist, deploring the
term “White Australia,” has
asked that some “less ugly” one
be used.
This is muddled thinking.
Unconsciously, he reasons
thus: it is superior to be white,
and degrading to be any other
color. Therefore it is unkind
to emphasise our whiteness in
the face of anyone of a
different hue.
Nothing, of course, could
be more absurd. It seems to me
that those who appear to
champion a “liberal” color-
policy are themselves the color-
snobs, taking it for granted,
quite fatuously, that colored
races all want to be white,
but as this is impossible we will
be frightfully kind and
not mention our obvious
superiority.
If such a person were asked
if he felt affronted by the
publication of a Yellow China
policy, he would think it silly;
yet on logical grounds there is
no more reason for the Chinese
(say) to be offended at our
White policy than it would be
for us to take offence were they
to declare a strict Yellow
policy.
We have every right to
assert our preference for our
own color, just as other races
have. The ludicrous assumption
that other people who don’t
happen to be white will be
affronted is twaddle.
Trouble can only arrive when
you let colored races in, and
then deny them any rights on
the grounds of color. —R. H. G.
(W.A.).
Colonialism
It’s no use “Jas. Macansh”
thinking that, because Aus-
tralia has never possessed
colonies, the type of Asiatic
politician who has taken-over
from colonial regimes will seek
-to cultivate our friendship
(B. 2/4/’5B).
Politicians of this kind
deliberately foster hatred of
what they term “colonialism”
to win popular support, just as
a certain type of Labor
politician keeps the class-
struggle stirred-up.
Asiatic hostility to “colonial-
ism” is really hostility to
Western influence ; the sort of
politician most vocal in this
agitation, though usually a
beneficiary of European educa-
tion, allies himself with anti-
European elements in his
country, and seeks to win and
retain office by pandering to
their prejudices.
The elements in question
hate all European influences,
religious and cultural, as well
as political and economic. The
more influential they become
the less likelihood is there of
good understanding with the
Western European world.
Part of the appeal Russia
has for many of them is the
fact that the regime in control
of that country is as inimical
as they are to the Western


European way of life. —

No More Chooks!
Another poultry-farmer in
our midst has bitten the dust.
He got 2s. Id. a pound live-
weight for hens, 3s. for
cockerels, and hen-rate for a
few roosters. About 900 head
all told. He’d paid 635. for the
last lot of bagged-wheat, and
rubbish at that, and £37 10s.
for laying-mash.
Infinitely better-off without
them, financially, and morally,
he can now keep the Sabbath
and enjoy the Sunday organised
sport.
Reckons that he was badly
advised, as a New Australian,
to have ever fallen for poultry.

Expensive Successes
Lawyers sometimes defend
high legal costs on the ground
that expensive litigation tends
to force hopeless cases out of
court and doubtful cases to a
settlement. The justice of this
argument is suspect where one
party lacks the financial
resources of the other and the
ultimate decision cannot be
forecast with reasonable
accuracy.
In the case of summary
offences, however, “P.0.M.C.”
must be correct when he says
(B. 9/4/’5B) that a system which
invariably penalises, the person
who pleads “not guilty” is
indefensible. There remains the
difficult task of selecting
appropriate reforms.
Obviously we are only con-
cerned with the person who not
only pleads, but also sustains
his. plea, that he has not
committed an offence. He
should be entitled to recover
reasonable expenses from the
Police Department, municipal
council or other employer of
the prosecutor. MacD
(Vic.).
Fancy Cheese
“Magoon’s” judgment of
the cheese industry (B.
12/3/’5B) doesn’t hold entirely
for Queensland, even if he does
come from that State.
Most of the cheese is made
on the Darling Downs.
Before the last war there were
cheese-factories scattered all
over the Downs, and many of
these were poorly equipped
and turned-out a cheese that
resembled soap.
After the war most of these
places closed down. Now the
manufacture of cheddar cheese
is centred in a few well-
equipped factories, staffed with
experienced men who are pro-
ducing a really first-class food.
The industry has admittedly
been slow to fake advantage
of the ready market for fancy
cheese—a market made secure
by the influx of New Aus-
tralians with a well-developed
taste for it.
One of the reasons why
fancy cheese is still only in its
infancy in Queensland is the
small amount of milk
available. Most of these
factories supply market-milk
to Brisbane. The price is more
attractive, it takes less work
to handle bulk-milk in the
factory, and the farmer is
happy with the bigger cheques.
Only what is left over goes
into the cheese-vat. Some-
times it’s barely enough to
fulfill outstanding orders for
cheddar, let alone any fancy
varieties.
Several factories on the
Downs are now making small
quantities of fancy cheese. The
quality is excellent and it is
snapped-up the minute it hits
the market. What is most
encouraging is the way the
industry is tackling the packag-
ing problem. Most factories
have installed modem
American machines which seal-
off the cheese in air-tight
plastic-bags. These are printed
in various colors with attrac-
tive advertising on the outside.
This has brought cheese into
line with other packaged
foods.
I agree with “M” that all the
handouts to the industry favor
the inefficient farmer. But
where can be found the
politician ready to take the
larger view and chop them
out? — Bilwon. (Qld.).
School-uniforms
That tax - deduction for
school-uniforms (B. 16/4/’5B)
doesn’t mean a thing to parents
of children who attend private
schools. Before they can get
round to totting-up the cost of
uniforms, they find that school-
fees have more than swallowed
the whole of the £lOO conces-
sion.—Muskeen (Vic.).
Tram-stops
Up to about 10 years ago,
Sydney did not “indulge the
lunacy of compelling all trams
to stop at every stop” (B.
9/4/’5B). A bell-cord, running
the full length of trams,
enabled passengers to indicate
to the drivers the stops at
which they wished to alight.
This system was discon-
tinued, and fixed stopping-
places restored, because (a) of
the high incidence of com-
plaints by irate passengers
carried beyond their required
stops, and ( b ) when a new
traffic - regulation made it
obligatory for the drivers of
all other vehicles to stop
behind stationary trams
setting-down or picking-up
passengers.
It was argued (with con-
siderable dissent) at the time
that conditional stopping -
places in main or busy
thoroughfares made the move-
ments of trams too uncertain
to other road-users. For

example, tram-drivers, on
receiving delayed signals to
stop, frequently pulled-up
sharply at, instead of
apparently passing through,
stopping-places, thereby often
dangerously confusing other
traffic behind them.
Still, Sydney trams do stop

The Aboriginal Problem
For the most part well-
meaning advocates of a better
deal for the oldest Australians
are incoherent and over-
sentimental. Their demands for
votes for all aborigines, full
rights, pensions and wages are
as impracticable as the sug-
gestion that all aborigines
should be left in thelf natural
state.
In my young days in the out-
back there were no welfare-
associations or protection-
boards, because the natives
were hardly ever in real touch
with urban life, for,, even
though their hunting-grounds
had been encroached upon, they
were still able to satisfy their
slender wants. But with the
extension of farming and the
creation of small settlements
upon the fringes of their haunts,
the aborigines began to glimpse
the easier way of life followed
by the white man. Their bark-
humpies began to appear on the
outskirts of "towns, and they
did odd jobs on nearby farrns
and in settlements.
This process.of semi-
urbanisation was frequently
accompanied by mixed
marriages, and resulted in the
acceptance of the shanty-town
idea. In some areas the dis-
gusting conditions of these have
been bettered through official
intervention ; but in the main
they are still shocking. The
situation has been aggravated
during the past decade or two
by the further encroachments
of the white man’s economic
interests in the interior
through extension of pastoral
industries, mining ventures, oil-
exploration and, more recently,
the demands of modern ballistic
science which have claimed vast
areas of-the arid centre.
In these circumstances it is
futile to talk of leaving the
native to work-out his own
existence. The whole problem
calls for long and careful study
by people who are able to
differentiate between those of
the native population who are
comparatively unaffected by
contact with civilisation, and
those who, for good or bad, are
capable of being assimilated
into a European way of life.
First consideration should be
given to those whose lives
have been affected in some
degree by white contact. The
factors here involved are health,
hygiene and education, includ-
ing vocational-guidance. To-
gether with housing, these
matters should be the subject of
studied policy based upon a
long view, thus completely
reversing the present day-to-day
empirical efforts of un-co-
ordinated bodies throughout
the continent. This is an Aus-
tralia-wide responsibility, and
the outside world looks upon it
as such. There is no place in
the job for either loose think-
ing or sentimentality.— Fred
Aarons (N.S.W.).
Defence
Apropos “Defence in the
Doldrums” (B. 16 /4 / ’5B), what
of the Navy? The present
policy seems to be the laying-
up of ships preparatory to
moth-balling which, in the lack
of trained personnel, is equiva-
lent to “reserved for scrap-
metal.”
New Zealand is now
awakening to the threat of
Russian submarines in the
Pacific. German submarines
twice nearly brought Britain
to her knees and were only
defeated by a colossal output
of vessels, aircraft and mines,
and other defence-measures.
We have a very small fleet
dedicated to dealing with the
underwater menace. Our Air
Force is spread too thinly to be
effective, and if we are pinning
our faith in help from the U.S.
we’ll find that that nation will
have more than it can handle
looking to its own interests in
the event of war.
Indifference and apathy have
allowed Communist elements
to gain full control of the vital
maritime unions. Preoccupa-
tion with political feuds,
lotteries, beer and more-pay-
for-less-work are no doubt
essential to the achievement of
a thriftless Welfare State, but
even a cursory glance at the
trend of world affairs suggests
that we may perhaps enjoy this
glamor for only a brief span.
Defence is merely a form of
insurance. Fiddling with the
premiums to be paid while
one’s house is being threatened
would appear to be singularly
foolish. — Advocate. (N.S.W.).

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
“DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS.”
THE MEXICAN DAM
r F'HE Mexican Dam, so
-*■ named because it is used
widely in Central America,
makes use of the water-holding
power of sand. Nature has
given the lead in this, for many
springs, soaks and under-
ground-supplies come from
water stored in sand.
Probably the best example
in Australia is the bed of the
Gascoyne River, W.A. This
stream comes down in flood
every few years, but for the
rest of the time its bed near
the mouth is merely a vast
stretch of white sand.
Yet that sand holds an
enormous quantity of water,
which is pumped out by a
regular forest of windmills
and used to irrigate the exten-
sive plantations of bananas
and other tropical fruits grown
at Carnarvon. Most of the
desert water-supplies used by
our aborigines, without which
they could not have existed in
big areas of country, also
came from sandbeds.
Just how much water a sand-
deposit will hold depends on
The mulesing of
lambs should be
carried out when they
are weaned. The
operation is per-
formed only once in
the lifetime of a
sheep and when it is
allied with correct
tail length and an
annual crutching will
give almost complete
protection from fly
strike. An added
protective measure is
to use Elastrator
Rubber Rings when
the lamb is marked
and tailed. This is a
bloodless system
avoiding open
wounds, the chief
attraction for flies.
the size and shape of the
individual grains in it, but it is
not uncommon to find a
sample which will hold half its
volume of water. A simple
test with a graduated measure
will show how much any
particular type of sand can
hold. Put a gallon of the dry
sand into a bucket, then tip
“Master said ’e Wanted t ’ go for a kangaroo-drive , ’e did .”
in water, a pint at a time, from
the measure until the sand is
saturated.
Now measure the length,
average breadth and average
depth of a big bed of sand in
a creek or river on the
property, and calculate the
number of cubicffeet which it
contains. Multiply this by six
to get a near-enough figure
for the number of gallons of
sand, then use the result of
your experiment to get an idea
of the quantity of water which
that sand-bed could hold if
saturated. Divide by three to
get an estimate of what it will
hold, under natural condi-
tions, to be on the safe side.
But, even if you take care to
make your estimate a very con-
servative one, you may be
surprised at the result. A really
big bed of sand will hold far
more water than an open dam
costing thousands of pounds to
excavate and bank.
Further, there is no loss by
evaporation when water is
stored in sand. A flood fills
it and then, always provided
that the underlying bed of the
creek is clay or impervious
rock, and there is a bar of
similar material across the
lower end to prevent the water
from seeping away down-
stream, it will stay there for
years unless pumped-out and
used.
But only one sand-bed in a
thousand has such a natural
embankment across its lower
end. If Nature didn’t put one
there, then the obvious step
is to build one.
The Mexicans do this in a
primitive but effective way.
Across the lower end of the
sand-bed a trench is excavated.
This is carried down to the
underlying rock or clay and
into the bank at either end.
This excavation is then
filled with clay, each layer
being we 11 e d-down and
puddled by ramming. It is
carried up to within a couple
of feet of the surface, and sand
is then replaced to the
surrounding level of the bed.
The next flash flood will
roar down the stream but it
will not affect that buried bar
of clay. When the flood goes
down, the sand upstream is
left filled with water, which is
pumped out as required for
livestock or irrigation.
Clay has been used for this
purpose in Australia, but it is
better to build a wall of rein-
forced concrete. It doesn’t
have to be very thick; the
sand on either side supports it
and its purpose is to provide
a watertight barrier. A con-
siderable saving of material
can be made by building this
concrete wall on the “upstream
arch” principle—with a curve,
the outside of which faces
upriver.
As is the case with a clay
bank, the top of this wall
should not be exposed, as this
would cause scouring when a
heavy flood came down. It
should have at least 18in. of
sand over it.
All through our inland
country, particularly in W.A.
and Western Queensland, there
are countless thousands of
these sand-beds in creeks and
rivers, some miles in length,
up to a hundred or more yards
wide and with an average
depth of 10 or more feet.
Even a comparatively small
creek-deposit, 100 ft. long, 50ft.
wide and 10ft. deep, composed
of angular sand-grains which
pack tightly and therefore
cannot hold much water, will
store up to a million gallons
if turned into a Mexican dam.
No other type of water-conser-
vation can impound so much
at such a low cost.
But a word of warning.
When excavating sand, even
when it is wet and should stay
put, take no chances. Always
give the sides a long slope, or
revett it with stout timbers, to
avoid the risk of having it
cave-in on you while the con-
crete wall is being built. Any
construction-worker will tell
you that sand can never be
trusted.

Jerrawa Show
There seemed to be more
members of the Bush family
than sheep at the Jerrawa
(N.S.W.) Show; 12 of them
were on the Show committee ;
and there is a natural tendency
for strangers, meeting so many
of the same name at what is
claimed to be “the biggest
little show in the south,” to
become, so to speak, bushed.
It is quite an event. Held
every Easter Monday (the
locals reckon Sam Hordern
must be quite perturbed at the
opposition to the Sydney
Show), 2200 turned-up this
year for the “majority,” or
21st show.
Jerrawa itself, between
Gunning and Yass, is in the
centre of the fine-wool country.
The animal that grows the wool
is a very important character.
They don’t eat mutton at
Jerrawa—at least I didn’t see
any there on Easter Monday.

Twin Lambs
“Fore”: During recent
weeks Australian lamb-raisers
have been impressed by the
argument that costs of pro-
duction can be reduced by
increasing the number of twins
dropped.
Although it might be a little
while before local owners can
turn-up their noses at any-
thing less than 150 per cent, of
weaners, or even mark 200
per cent, regularly, the pro-
duction of more twins is
definitely possible under Aus-
tralian conditions.
One way of doing this is to
flush the ewe-flock well on
greenstuff just before mating,
but even this can be bettered
by also breeding-up a strain
of fecund ewes with good
milk-supplies.
The ewe which has twins
this season is quite likely to
have them next season, too,
and, what’s more, her lambs
are likely to have twins when
they join the breeding-flock.
Good milk-flows generally
go with ewes which have to
raise two lambs.
South Australian
Inventors
“Alden: South Australians
have contributed a lot to the
art and mechanics of farming—
Ridley’s stripper comes to mind
immediately in any discussion
of the history of farm-
machinery in Australia. And
there are other examples. For
instance, the stump-jump
plough had its beginnings in
the Croweater State, and the
first culti-trash combine was
marketed by a well-known
South Australian firm.
Eyre Peninsula recently
gave the world two new
machines —a disk stump-rower
and a scrub-rake. Both of these
would have been particularly
useful 50 years ago, but they
will still save a lot of back-
breaking work in the clearing
and picking-up which has to
be done.
K. Olsen’s stump-rower

or stones, along a row of 20in.
disks until they fall out the
end in a long line, from which
they can be burnt or picked-
up with a front-end loader.
Another, comparatively
recent, South Australian stone-
picker works differently it
collects the stones in the holes
of a big wheel and throws them
on to a truck or trailer.
Features of W. A. Franklin’s

wheels, double-acting hydraulics
for holding the spring-steel
tynes firmly in position, and
specially-shaped end-tynes to
prevent spilling before the load
is tripped on to a windrow.
Oats in Queensland
“Myall”: Several varieties of
oats, new to Queensland, will
be given a trial this season,
particularly on the Darling
Downs, where about 75 per
cent, of the oats produced in
the State are grown. Farmers
are looking for a variety that
will “come” quickly, give
superior recovery after graz-
ing, and then yield a heavy
crop of grain. At present that
old favorite, Algerian, holds
pride of place, and it seems as
if it may be a long time
before it is superseded. Sown
during February or March, so
that it has a long growing-
period, it gives good feed
right into the early summer.
Many old hands will sow dur-
ing May and June, and have
an abundance of green fodder
until November.
But a new variety called
Ballidu, raised in Western Aus-
tralia, has much to recommend
it. A cross between Mulga and
Burt’s Early, it has a vigorous
early growth, recovers well
after grazing, and has proved
a good variety for sowing over
a wide range of conditions.
Reputed to be superior to
Mulga, it is suitable for graz-
ing, hay or grain, and is very
popular in W.A.
A selection from White
Ligowo and Algerian, Guyra
is a mid-season variety. While
the early growth is very palat-
able, and is relished by stock,
it doesn’t recover too well after
grazing. The grain is plump
and of a dark-brown color,
and is suitable for milling or
crushing. This variety has
been recommended as very
suitable for Queensland condi-
tions.
A relatively new, mid-
season variety, Avon is a selec-
tion from Ballidu and Mulga
crossed with Laggan. A
strong grower, it stools well,
and recovers quickly after
grazing to give a high grain-
yield. One distinct advantage
is that it doesn’t shed its grain
readily.
Over the past three years
Bovar has been very popular,
but seems to be losing favor.
It is very quick and gives a
long grazing-season, but the
grain sheds very easily. Some
growers prefer Victoria Rich-
land, as it is a rapid grower
and has good recovery after
being fed-off. It produces a
heavy crop of grain, which
holds for a long time after
maturity. This variety has a
big following, although not as
large as Algerian.
Very little interest is being
shown in most other varieties,
with the exception of Ful-
ghum, which has been in
greater demand than usual.
One of the best grazing-oats,
it recovers quickly, and gives
a greater bulk of early feed
than any other variety.
Acacia, Mulga, Clinton,
Waterhaus, Belah, Klein and
Orient, although excellent
kinds in certain localities, all
seem to be waning in popu-
larity. As an all-rounder,
especially when sown early,
the 50-year-qld Algerian is
still able to hold its own
against all-comers.
Dairying
“North”: Was greatly
interested in “P.C.M.’s” article
(B. 5/3/’5B) referring to
“Cocky’s” statement (B.
2/2/’5B) that “most dairy-
farmers are mixed-farmers.”
From “P.C.M.’s” remarks, one
must presume that he is referr-
ing to dairyfarmers in the
southern States, while “Cocky”
obviously meant those in
Queensland.
“Cocky” is quite correct in his
assertion that most farmers in
the northern State do combine
other activities, such as pig-
raising, grain-growing and even
raising sheep and fat-cattle,
with dairying, which, however,
is the main source of income.
They are dairyfarmers in the
true sense, most of them milk-
ing between 40 and 100 cows
daily throughout the year.
If “P.C.M.” were to visit
this State, he would see
thousands of dairyfarms with
buildings and plant worth far
more than the £2500 he men-
tions. One farm on the Darling
Downs covers an area of 11,000
acres, the whole of which is
under production. The owner
supervises the agricultural
section, and employs several
men to work the dairy, which
is one of the most up-to-date
in Australia.
If conditions are as


unhygienic a s M P.C.M. W
claims, why do the dairy-
inspectors allow the produce of
such farms to be used in any
food for human consumption?,
Queensland’s dairy-regulations
are very strict and are enforced
by inspectors, who give every
assistance to dairymen, but will
deregister anyone who refuses
to bring buildings or plant up
to standard.
Dairy-buildings must have
concrete floors, which must be
cleaned at least once daily,
while cream and milk must be
stored in a gauzed-in, fly-
proof building, at least 50yds.
from the bails. A farmer milk-
ing less than 12 cows is not a
dairyman but a backyarder;
but he must be registered if he
wishes to supply milk or cream
to a factory, and his buildings
must be just as clean as those
of the big man.
Why should any farmer be
branded as an “inefficient
nuisance” just because he only
milks six or seven cows, pro-
vided the cream he supplies is
first-grade?
Brisbane health - authorities
have prohibited dairying within
the city boundaries, and milk-
vendors have been forced to
draw their supplies from
country districts. Huge tankers
make round-trips within a
100-mile radius of the city,
collecting milk from the out-
lying farms.
This relieves the dairyman of
separating and the work
associated with it, allowing him
more time to attend to the
cultivating of his paddocks.
Cream - carriers collect the
cream at the farms, and this
does-away with the necessity of
the farmer taking his product to
the railway-station, and saves
him time.
With milking-machines and
other modern appliances, work
in the dairy is finished about
eight o’clock in the morning,
so, with an hour for breakfast,
the dairyfarmer is ready for at
least six hours’ work on the
cultivation. With tractors and
other machinery, quite a lot
can be done in fhat time, and
the dairy will not have been,
neglected.
Each year, the Royal
National Association conducts
a State-wide competition in
conjunction with the Brisbane
Show. The State is divided
into zones, and prizes are
awarded for the best dairy-
farms in each zone. Judging
takes place just before the Show
in August. Field-days are held
on the winning properties by
the officials of the R.N.A. and
the Agricultural Department,
and farmers for many miles
around attend, and inspect the
eastures and the farm-build-
tgs. Almost without excep-
tion, the winner is a mixed-
farmer.
A recent winner on the
Darling Downs owns a
property of about 1000 acres,
250 of which are under culti-
vation. He runs a stud in con-
junction with the dairy, and
raises pigs as a sideline to
dispose of the skimmed-milk.
Between 2000 and 3000 bags
of grain are harvested during
a normal year, and after suffi-
cient for 12 months’ require-
ments has been stored away,
the balance is sold on the open
market. A paddock of lucerne
provides an abundance of hay,
which is stored away in bales,
against times of drought.
About 100 acres are under
permanent pasture, and this
area is constantly being
increased.
Fodder for the cattle is put
through a hammer-mill, which
reduces both grain and hay
into meal, and meat-meal is
added to supply protein to
make a balanced ration. The
milkers are hand-fed through-
out the year, and this practice
pays handsomely.
All dairy - buildings are
built high and airy, with water
laid-on and good drainage.
The floors are of concrete, and
are kept very clean. A skip
on rails, run from the feed-
room along the front of the
bails, makes feeding quick and
easy.
Herd-testing is carried-out
and all unprofitable cows are
culled. The farmer keeps
accurate records of all income
and expenditure, and can tell
to a penny just how much a
pound of cream costs to
produce. The pig-sties are all
under cover, with concrete
floors and a concrete pool for
the animals to wallow in.
These are hosed-down daily.
This dairyfarm is only one of
many hundreds on the Downs,
and if “P.C.M.” can produce
anything better, he certainly
has something well worth-
while.
Tractor Care
“Sundowner”: Care of the
tractor is just as important as
good horse-management was
in the pre-tractor days.
For 100 per cent, efficiency
every day the vehicle is in use
clean fuel, water, and oil, as
needed, should be added, and
close attention paid to greas-
ing-instructions.
In addition, regular oil and
oil-filter changes are essential
to prolong the life of the
machine. These should be
done every 100 hours for most
conditions, or to the recom-
mendations of the manufac-
turer.
The air-cleaner should be
serviced daily, and if it’s of the
wet type, new oil of the same
grading as used in the engine
must be used.
Another daily “must” is
checking of tyre-pressures—
121b. in rear-tyres and 30 to
341 b. in the front. When
ploughing, the rear-furrow
wheels should have the pressure
increased by 21b. to 41b.,
depending on the depth of the
furrow.
Since grease and oil are the
enemies of rubber, a weekly
check should be made to see
that rubber parts are entirely
free.
Batteries want constant
attention, while fuel-filters,
need cleaning regularly if the
unit is a diesel. Spark-plugs
should be cleaned and reset,
distributor or magneto
inspected, moving parts and
rotor-shaft wick oiled spar-
ingly, as well as oil-generator
and starter - motor bearings.
And don’t forget levels in diff.,
gearbox and steering-box.
For general-service gear-box
and diff. oil should be changed
every 500 hours or at six-
monthly intervals, whichever
is the shorter. Radiator-
screens and -core should be
kept clean of chaff and straw
and tension on fan-belt and
dynamo - drive adjusted
regularly.
While these are the essen-
tials, degreasing and cleaning
every so often improves the
appearance of the unit and
makes the job of servicing
cleaner and easier.
It also must be remembered
that regular mechanical checks
and overhauls such as valve-
grinds and repacking of wheel-
bearings increase operating
efficiency and save on recon-
ditioning costs.
Lures
“Paracide”: Just as moths
are attracted to the light, so
all animals, birds and insects
find it hard to resist certain
lures.
Oil-angelica and anisyl-
acetone have been used suc-
cessfully in Europe and U.S.A.
to attract the fruit-fly. These
substances will be tried soon in
South Australia, and, if suc-
cessful, no doubt in other States.
They are reputed to be
irresistible to fruit-flies within
440yds. Supplies of anisyl-
acetone, especially, are limited,
but greater demand could
stimulate greater supply.
Melbourne Research
Stations
“Wooroa”: Melbourne is a
growing centre of many agri-
cultural and pastoral research-
stations. Within 50 miles of
the capital, an increasing
number of both private and
Government institutes are con-
tributing greatly to the know-
ledge which keeps Australia
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(17/4/’58 )
Sunspot activity may lead to further heavy rains and
cyclonic activity on the Queensland coast and the N.S.W.
north and central coast between April 25 and 30.
Queensland may get only light, patchy rains during
May, although moderate rain may occur on part of the
north coast. General rains are indicated in the whole of
the State during June.
Moderate rains are indicated on the southern tablelands,
south-west slopes and in the Riverina during May, but the
balance of the State may get only light, patchy rains.
General rains should occur in June, and a good season
should follow in the southern and central divisions.
Victoria should receive good general rains in May, with
the best falls occurring on the west coast and in the east-
central and upper north-east areas. Fairly heavy rains
should follow during June and July.
The agricultural areas of South Australia should receive
good rains during May, heaviest in the Stirling Ranges. But
the interior may get only light rain, with general rains in
the whole of the State during June.
Rainfall will probably vary from moderate to good in
the south-west agricultural areas of Western Australia
during May, with the best rains on the central and south
Coasts and in the s.-w. central south. Apart from reasonably
good rains in the Kimberleys, rainfall likely to be poor
elsewhere, with good general rains during June.

Piped Water
. “Busta”: News of piped
water-system to West Rainbow
(Vic.) recalls the State Rivers
and Water Supply’s booklet on
the Wimmera-Mallee scheme,
which quotes the price of water
for Rainbow at something like
Is. a gallon in dry times before
channels were provided.
Cost of the new 35-mile pipe-
line —just over £lOOO a mile —
was shared by the commission
and farmers, who can now get
lOOOgals. a day for each square-
mile. Success of the scheme
could lead to extensions of the
pipe further north, where it
has been sought by farmers
for many years.
It would at least guarantee
nearly all of the water becom-
ing available on farms instead
of the comparatively small
proportion which reaches its
destination because of seepage
and evaporation. Pipes would
also protect channel-easements,
which, in many cases, have
been spoiled by seepage.
South Australia takes a lot
of water a long way in pipes.

Fencing Progress

of toil and time out of fencing,
are in danger of being replaced

portable, younger edition of
the pile-driver which R. L.
Piesse, a fencing hobbyist-
expert, demonstrated recently
at Mornington (Vic.).
With creosote oozing out of
its top, a round post was
rammed into the ground faster
than it would have taken to
do the first crowbarring to dig
a hole. It was tight enough to
resist the attempts of onlookers
to move it.
At the demonstration, 12
posts were sunk in an hour —

three-posts-to-the-chain fence.
Piesse said that accepted
fencing designs in Australia
lagged far behind those of other
countries-, where much research
had gone into the problem.
In particular, our strainer-
posts are thicker and
shallower than in some other
places ; stays often rot before
the posts and cause strainers
to sag ; and it is possible that
lighter-gauge wire could do as
good a job more cheaply than
the standard No. 8 does at
present.
Myxo. Lab.
“Merry”: The specially
equipped mobile laboratory
recently presented to G.
Douglass, Victoria’s Co-ordi-
nator of Rabbit Control, will
help greatly in the study
of mosquitoes and other carriers
of myxomatosis, and thus play
its part in keeping-down Aus-
tralia’s worst pest. Fitted-up as
a caravan, the lab. will enable
research-workers to make their
studies on the spot and be
independent of accommodation
or lab. facilities many miles
from their work.
By contributing funds to this
lab., producer - organisations
have done a good job ? but the
main thing to remember is that
monetary , support can never
be merely a substitute for active
destruction of rabbits on the
property by 1080 poisoning,
ripping, and continual harass-
ment, as well as by myxo-
matosis.
Even before myxo., rabbits
were controlled best by land-
holders who kept them on the
run continually.
Low-rainfall Trees
“Big Billy”: Four years of
patient research in the sandy-
loam soils of S.A.’s Murray
Mallee districts has resulted in
useful information concerning
the best types of trees to grow
in these low-rainfall areas.
More than 90 different
varieties of shade-trees will do
well on an annual rainfall of
at least llins., once they have
been established.
Period of establishment of a
sound rooC- system, during
which regular summer-water-
ings will be necessary, is two
seasons. In addition, hessian-
guards and summer-mulching
are “musts.”
Most successful (species in-
clude a number of the eucalypts.
They are the coral-gum, the
black-butt, the yellow-flowered
black-butt, the Yates-gum, and
the fuchsia-gum.
Of the native oaks, swamp-
oak, and black-oak did well,
while of the acacias the jatu-
wattle, Hindmarsh - wattle,
umbrella-wattle and myall ail
thrived.
Others listed are the African-
olive, the Aleppo-pine, the
boobiella, carob-tree, pyramid-
tree, black tea-tree and the
bracelet honey-myrtle.


Women's Letters
MELBOUKNE
Once again the Anzac Fellowship of
Women served biscuits and hot coffee
for the men who attended the Dawn
Service at the Shrine. The president
(Lady White) and members were assisted
by Toe H. and Intermediate Legacy at
their stall at the southern gateway of
Victoria Barracks in St. Kilda Road.
Over 30 wreaths were laid at the foot
of the Edith Cavell statue in St. Kilda
Road at the service which honors all
nurses who gave their lives in the two
world wars. The memorial address was
given by Colonel C. G. Shaw.

The U.K. Liaison Staff held a delight-
ful party at Army Headquarters Officers’
Mess, Victoria Barracks, on the night
of the Queen’s birthday. Host and
hostess were the Chief of the U.K.L.S.,
Rear-Admiral R. S. Wellby, and Mrs.
Wellby, the latter wearing a sheath-frock
of ice-blue Chinese satin-brocade pat-
terned in tiny pink flowers and embroid-
ered with gold thread.
Guests included Premier Bolte and
Mrs. Bolte; Chief Secretary Arthur Rylah
and his wife (she in the uniform of the
Girl Guides); the Lieut.-Govemor, Sir
Edmund and Lady Herring ; Archbishop
Woods and Mrs. Woods ; Chief of the
General Staff, Lieut.-General A. R.
Garrett, and Mrs. Garrett ; Air-Vice-
Marshal Allan Walters and Mrs.
Walters ; Air-Vice-Marshal A. E. Daley
and Mrs. Daley ; Air-Vice-Marshal and
Mrs. Harry Acton ; Mr. and Mrs. Nor-
man Robinson ; Mr. and Mrs. Gordon
Macarthur and Mr. and Mrs. Ken Luke
(the latter pair leave for a three-months’
trip to the U.S. and England today). The
beautiful massed red, white and blue
flowers used as decorations were
arranged by Mrs. Farnfield (wife of the
Asst. U.K. Naval Adviser, Capt. G. L.
Farnfield).

There were many beautiful theatre-
coats seen at the Comedy Theatre when
“The Shifting Heart” had its premiere
in this city (one of its suburbs, Colling-
wood, is the setting for the play’s action).
Mrs. S. G; Aarons chose a very bouffant
coat of raisin-toned shot-silk organza;
Mrs. Dorothy Gitsham a full-backed one
of blush-pink velvet, the high collar
finished with a large flat bow. Mrs.
Keith Hattam's was in kingfisher-blue
velvet, and this was worn over a frock
of white re-embroidered lace. Lady Tait
chose a bouffant coat of black faille.
Parents of the playwright, Mr. and Mrs.
D. Beynon, were in the audience, Mrs.
Beynon wearing a ballerina-frock of
teal-blue pure-silk with a white-ermine
stole.
Also noted were Mrs. H. E. Bolte and
Lady Selleck, Mr. and Mrs^-Kenneth
Myer (her theatre-coat was of emerald-
green taffeta), Sir John and Lady Smed-
ley, Mr. and Mrs. Ronald Nott (she
smart in a full-skirted black faille frock
and sable scarf), Mr. and Mrs. A. T.
Smithers, Lady Grimwade and Miss
Gertrude Johnson.
It is over 25 years since Mrs. Herbert
Brookes founded the International Club.
During that time many national groups,
strangers to this country, met and made
friends while they were being assimilated
into our way of life. Now, with the in-
flux of so many migrants who have
formed their own groups, the Inter-
national Club has closed its doors. From
the sale of the club-building in East
Melbourne, which has been bought
by the Y.W.C.A., and money in
hand, Mrs. Brookes recently handed a
cheque for £5000 to Professor Sir Ian
Clunies Ross to assist the university’s
International House for students from
overseas. She is also handing over to the
Public Library all data connected with
the club. Mrs. Brookes is a daughter of
Alfred Deakin. She and Mr. Brookes
have two sons and one daughter.
The Sunshine range of tailored skirts,
shorts and pants and cotton knitted tops
for the summer months, was paraded in
Maurice Dowd’s new Flinders Lane
showrooms, which were opened by Sena-
tor Ivy Wedgwood. The display featured
gay, moderately-priced materials such as
sailcloth, moygashel, linen and printed
cotton in colors which will ally smart
skirts with the knitted-cotton top. Dowd’s
well-tailored shorts were seen in contrast-
ing color-combinations. The checker-
board pattern was used, colors including
mango, Dior-red, electric-blue, emerald-
green and, of course, black and white.
Several of the shorts were trimmed with
cornelli work, others with buttons and
tabs or cotton-pique pocket-reverses, with
matching belts. In the pants range, this
manufacturer has kept to the “Mediter-
ranean” theme, with varying lengths, but
with narrow, tapered legs. An Italian-
inspired style, in black-and-white sail-
cloth, was trimmed with contrasting
buttons winding down the outside of the
saddle-stitched seams to the front of the
leg.
Leading the new romper designs is the
“jump suit,” ankle-length and made of
terry-towelling and zipped right up the
front, finishing in a roll-collar. Other
jumpers are in gay tropical prints. A
one-piece romper can be worn loose or
belted and is matched by a flared over-
skirt, pleated from the waist and self-
belted. With another romper is shown a
matching hip-length smock-type jacket,
with full sleeves, cuffed and buttoned.

Still on the fashion round, a range of
fineline-chenille candlewick dressing -
gowns held the limelight. These are
tufted with lines so closely together, and
the tufting so close-clipped, that the whole
of the fabric is that of a satin-sheen
chenille. Among the lovely colors shown
were new-blue, lagoon-blue, crimson-
glory, French-rose, sky-blue, wild-rose
and lipstick-pink. Some gowns had
elasticised wrists and back-waist, and
bodices which featured a nipped-in waist
finished witn two-buttan fastening and
slim skirts. Others had swirling full skirts
and cross-over bodices. They launder
well and need no ironing, and are a
product of Supertex Industries.

To celebrate the 10th Independence
Day of Israel, the Women’s International
Zionist Organisation held a luncheon, for
300 guests, at Stanmark, East St. Kilda.
Federal president Mrs. Julia Rapke
received the guests with State president
Mrs. M. Jacobsen. A festival meal was
served, of which each course was symbolic
of certain events in the history and life of
Israel. Fruit-cocktail made from grape-
fruit was followed by hors d’ oeuvres with
techina sauce and salmon pathes. The
sauce is an Oriental dish made of ground
sesame-seeds. The baked fish and rice
(the main dish) symbolised the blending
of East and West and the ingathering of
exiles from every part of the world. This
dish was served with spinach, a remem-
brance of the siege of Jerusalem, when
spinach was one of 7 the few available
foods the people could grow. Fruit-cake,
made with all the fruits now grown irt
Israel, was served as dessert.
Among the official guests who heard
Mrs. Rapke explain the work of W.1.Z.0,
were Mrs. Harold Holt, Mrs. Henry
Bolte, Mrs. R. G. Casey and Mrs. A. E.
Shepherd. Other guests were Lady Con-
nelly, Lady Martin, Lady Michaelis, Mrs,
E. Snider; representatives of other
women’s organisations were Mrs. Gladys
Hain, Dr. Janet Cooper, Mrs. Eccles
McKay, Mrs. Guy Bakewell, Mrs. A. A»
Lord and Mrs. T. J. Ryan.


SYDNEY
Luncheons in private homes as a means
of raising money for good causes are
becoming increasingly popular because
of the pleasantness of the occasion, the
exotic dishes served (committee-members
really “go to town” on the cooking), and
the opportunity to greet one’s friends in
what is generally an interesting setting.
The women’s auxiliary which works
for the Deaf and Blind Children under
the leadership of Mrs. Bill White held
such a luncheon during the week at the
spacious Killara home of Mrs. F. Klinger.
A film in color, “The Cruise of the Lur-
line” (from San Francisco to Tahiti), was
shown after luncheon. Among those
present were Mrs. Clifford Sharp, Mrs.
Morton Cohen, Mrs. Leslie Tidmarsh,
Mrs. Ella Westwood and Mrs. Cecil
Sharpe.

“Children are our most valuable mi-
grants,” said Dr. H. S. Wyndham, Direc-
tor-General of Education, when speaking
at the annual general meeting of the
women’s auxiliary in aid of Dr. Barn-
ardo’s Homes. Dr. Wyndham pointed-
out that while we must wait at least one
generation before adult migrant-families
become really Australian, Dr. Barnardo’s
boys are half-way to being Australians
when they land.
Hie president of the Mrs.
Rupert Scammell, presented to General
Pulver a cheque for £lOOO for the Homes.
Cheques for £5OO and £53 15s. were
presented on behalf of the Newcastle
auxiliaries by Mrs. J. H. Clack. Sue
Slade, secretary of the, Sydney younger
set, presented a cheque for £3OO. In all,
the auxiliary has raised over £3OOO for
the Homes during the past 12 months.
❖ ♦♦♦ *t*
“Why Do You Sell Australia Short?”
was the subject of a most stimulating
and provocative talk by U.S. Consul
Orray Taft to members of the Women
Writers’ Association during the week.
According to Mr. Taft we Australians
make no attempt to tell Americans of the
attractions which our country has to
offer. We are more inclined to say:
“Why come to Australia? Our pubs are
awful, our roads are incredible and there
is nothing to see! ”
Yet, says Mr. Taft, South Australia
can show the oldest exposed rocks in the
world, regions like the Kimberleys are
most interesting, buffalo-hunts can com-
pare with lion-hunts. Americans like the
outback and many of them are fascinated
by deserts. All they want for accommo-
dation is a bed; their whisky-and-soda
and some ice—things easily lined up. But
Mr. Taft’s point was not what could be
done, but why don’t we tell Americans
of the things they can see here?
Mrs. Hilda Abbott and Mrs. Toby
Browne, who were both at the luncheon,
spoke-up about the wonders of the
Northern Territory. Mrs. Lillian Shoed-
ler, an American visitor who is taking
three years to see Australia, said it was
very hard to get information on inter-
esting trips because so many people were
either not interested or just didn’t know
about them. Mrs. H. J. Brady contrasted
our lack of tourist-publicity with the
enterprise of the South African tourist-
bureaux. Mrs. G. Spencer-Morton pre-
sided over a very lively and informative
function.
There are some signs of life, however,
on the tourist-attraction front. Last Wed-
nesday a scenic skyway at Katoomba was
opened by Chief Secretary C. A. Kelly.
This skyway will carry tourists 1000
feet above the floor of the Jamieson
Valley and is the first of its kind in
Australia.
At the opening Mr. Kelly said that
there were proposals at the moment to
greet visitors to Australia in the Hawaiian
manner. Those who may have wondered
where the hula-girls were to be found
in Australia were put right by the Director
of Tourist Activities, Mr. H. D. Best,
who said that the welcome was more
likely to include the playing of Australian
tunes, exhibitions of boomerang-throw-
ing, barbecues, and, possibly, greetings
by some of Australia’s pretty girls.
Glamorous Margaret Wolfit, who plays
a Czech official (one who wears stun-
ning Paris models) in “The Great Sebas-
tians,” now at the Royal, is the daughter
of English actor Sir Donald Wolfit. Like
many keen and aspiring actresses, she
served her time in repertory and can play
everything from a housemaid to Lady
Macbeth. Her previous Australian stage
appearance was in “Witness for the Pro-
secution.”
Chat about the week’s doings included
the subject of the sale of Hillview, the
Sutton Forest residence of former State
Governors. It was bought at auction for
£35,000 by Mr. E. H. Klein, who intends
to make it a home for those older people
whose incomes are about £6OO p.a. and
for whom little provision is made at
present.
Also in the “small-talk” news were
the dresses being worn by Princess
Margaret in the West Indies, really short
but no sacks as yet. One photo of her
wearing a balloon-skirt was seized-on
by some editor and labelled a sack. But
then most men think these days that any-
thing rather strange must be a sack.
* *
The booksellers report a considerable
rise in the sale of Dickens’s works since
Welsh author-actor Emlyn Williams came
to town, and no wonder! For in his
“readings” at the Assembly Hall Mr.
Williams conjures-up the whole world
of Dickens characters and shows the
wealth and richness of that writer in a
way that even the most devoted reader
may not have realised.
On the night before Anzac Day he read
“The Battle of Life” with such great
feeling there were few members of the
audience who could hold back their tears.
CANBERRA
The garden of Dr. and Mrs. Pat
Calvert’s Red Hill home, aglow with
autumn foliage, made an ideal setting
for a garden-party and autumn fashion-
parade in aid of the A.C.T. division of
Red Cross. Mrs. B. A. Thomas, whose
Tina Frock Salon supplied the garments
for the parade, “helped-out” by modelling
some attractive suits and coats, along
with four Canberra models; one coat
much admired was cut on barrel lines in
cinnamon wool, with mink-trimmed
shawl-collar. In the glamorous after-five
group, black predominated, but one frock
that caught the eye was in oriental-pink
brocade and featured the new bloused
back. Mrs. A. L. Senger, who compered
the parade, wore an elegant frock in ash-
grey wool and small side-tipped hat in
blue felt. The hostess, Mrs. Calvert,
assisted by Mrs. B. Roberts and'Miss C.
Box with members of the Turner
branch, served a delicious Devonshire
afternoon-tea. During the parade a
special appeal was made for clothing to
assist the Skaubryn survivors. The £BO
proceeds will help the Red Cross funds.

The ninth annual exhibition of the
Canberra Art Club was officially
opened by the High Commissioner for
Canada, Mr. T. W. L. Mac Dermot. The
opening at 8 Riverside was well attended;
noted there the French Ambassador and
Mme. Renaud Sivan; the Japanese
Ambassador and Mrs. T. Suzuki; the
Netherlands Ambassador, Mr. H. J.
Lovink, and the German Charge
d’Affaires, and Mrs. Otto Burchard. Sixty
works in oils and watercolor were shown,
also a group of paintings on loan from
the National University ; these included
works by Justin O’Brien, Arthur Boyd
and Elaine Haxton. Some pottery pieces
by Ivan England and Margaret Frankel,
added to the interest of the exhibition.


CANNIBAL HORSE
By CYRIL E. GOODE
WHENEVER I go to
have a couple of quiet
drinks someone asks
me about a trivial
incident 1 must have mentioned
on a previous occasion. One of
my companions at a hotel m
Melbourne took a sip at his
pot, looked up at me and said:
“What was that yarn about
the ghost-rider and the
cannibal-horse?”
“I never found-out what
happened to him,” I answered.
“1 mean the rider, not the
horse. And he was no ghost;
he was as real as any of you
chaps.’’
“Well, it's new : to me,” said
another fellow, moving over and
joining our circle. So I had to
tell him.
TOURING the depression,
when I jumped more trains
than I can remember, a rattler
brought me to the West Aus-
tralian goldfields and eventually
Kalgoorlie. 1 was camping out
in the mulga at the lower end
of Hannan Street and following-
up the mines ‘J and between-
times folloWing-up the cafes,
meat-shops and groceries a
piece of meat, sawdust attached,
from one placeman onion front
another, a potato from another
—never more than one article
from one shop, because 1
never believed in exhausting
my credit.
The fellow in this story was
doing the same ; he camped m
a bag-shelter next to mine till
one day he sold a bush-ballad
to the “Kalgoorlie Miner.”
From then on his verses
appeared with some regularity
in this daily . . . and overflowed
to “The Observer” and “Argus”
—weekly papers, you know —
and he moved up into a cheap
boarding-house and started to
drink.
A CROWD of us collected at
* the pie-wagon near the
corner of Hannan and Maritana
Streets alter midnight when the
afternoon-shift men were
coming out of the pubs. The
hotels closed officially at eleven,
but they couldn't let the miners
go to bed dry.
Well, the Mad Poet (as
people were starting to call this
character) came up weaving a
little and quoting Greek and
Latin tags, and ordered a hot
pie. The pieman, a bit of a
bastard in anyone s language,
said: “Sprry mate, all tfie hot
ones are gone,” and clamped
one down, adding: “Stone-
cold, Shakspeare.”
The Poet picked it up and
bit into it, in one motion.
Though he now had a certain
medium of security he still ate
wildly. It takes years for a
man who has been starved to
break himself out of this
habit. The pie was boiling hot,
and the poor fellow’s mouth
was badly burned. His language
was terrible; he forgot his
classical background and
broke into English terse
Anglo-Saxon.
Eventually he cooled-down
and wandered off into the
starry night; but before we
had stopped talking about him
he reappeared, leading by the
mane a rather fine stamp of
riding-hack. Jqt-black it was.
He said he had met it on a
vacant allotment.
He glared at the pie-vendor
and said: “This is a cannibal-
horse, brother ; give it a cold
pie.”
TZj’VERYONE around saw the
-*- jr point and laughed, but it
was too subtle for the pieman.
He wondered what we were
all laughing at._
One of the young miners
standing around with his
carbide-lamp hooked into his
belt said: “If you pull that
trick again, Sweeney Todd,
we'll break your bloody wagon
up.”
Ihe pieman said his name
wasn’t Sweeney Todd, but he
wasn’t so sure'of himself now,
and the eight or nine pies he
served to the horse were cold,
all right. Some of the men
had bottled beer and started
ripping the caps off on the
wagon-tyres and passing it
around.
It developed into a memor-
able party. I know I had more
than my share and I’m sure the
Poet had more than his. I
never called him the Mad Poet
because I believe in live-and-
lct-live.
The Poet became expansive
and started to lie obviously.
He claimed he was O'Keefe’s
trainer, and that the horse was
Land o’ Green. He said that
if he could keep the pies up
to it the Kalgoorlie Cup was
as good as in the bag. Kevin
O’Keefe had the Railway Hotel
at this time and one of his
horses had this name.
To keep the ball rolling
someone asked: “If you’re
secretly training at night,
where’s the saddle and bridle?”
“Fm a balance-rider,” the
Poet answered. "When I was
a kid I learned to steer horses
by placing a hand over their
eyes.”
At last the bottled beer, cut-
out and some bright spark
suggested that the Poet should
take the horse for a preliminary
canter to let us all see its form.
They helped him up.
I’m not very clear aboui
what happened then. Every-
one yelled at once. Someone
kicked the horse in the belly
and someone else slapped it
on the rump. What I’m sure
about is that the horse rose
straight up into the air and
came down galloping. The last
thing I remember seeing was
the Poet far out on its neck,
trying to place his hand over
its right eye.
He must have managed this,
because it swung sharply to the
left on its two inside legs and
vanished down the narrow lane
on the Boulder City side of
Hannan Street.
This seemed to sober the
crowd up. I think everyone
expected a tragedy. We all
ran, as well as we could, to
the corner of the lane, fearing
to find this rather likeable
character slumped on the
stones. Two young policemen
who had been keeping a
humorous eye on proceedings
reached the lane first. When I
caught up with them they had
their caps off and were scratch-
ing their heads in puzzlement.
There was no sign of the horse
or its rider. A long way down
the lane was a vacant allotment
where a shop had been burnt
down; but even Phar Lap
couldn’t have done it in that
time.
/”*kNE of the chaps listening to
me in the Melbourne bar
called for another round
and suggested that the horse
had jumped into one of
the backyards. I patiently
explained that all the yards
abutting on the lane had seven-
foot corrugated-iron fences
cut into spikes on the top.
“That doesn’t explain it,” I
said. And as a kind of
addendum I said, “There had
been a big fall of earth in that
allotment the week before, but
we searched * the cavity next
morning and found nothing. I
don’t think they ever reached
Hannan Street.”
A young fellow who really
wasn’t one of our team —he
had pushed in somehow—gave
a coarse laugh and observed:
“We’ll give you the purple
belt.” .
Then a stranger with a
Heard Island beard-trim, dis-
consolately nursing an empty
pot, spoke-up: “Your story is
fundamentally correct, brother.
They couldn’t have got out into
Hannan Street in that time. I
know the place well.”
This made me feel better. It
upsets me when people dis-
believe me. I nodded towards
the empty pot into which my
supporter intermittently stared
sadly, x and said: “What about a
recap?”
He said, “I don't mind if I
do.”
Then an ugly situation
developed. The same callow
youth who had wanted to give
me a purple belt gave an even
coarser laugh and sneered:
“Give him a purple belt, too.”
The man with the Phil Law
beard was raising his pot; he
froze with anger. He slapped
the pot down and with a look
of supreme spurnery towards
the\youth, and stamped out of
the bar.
The swing-doors hadn’t
stopped swinging when he
strode back again. I thought
he was going to hit the young
fellow, who really deserved
some punishment; but he
picked up his pot, saying,
“There isn’t such a thing as
bad beer, even if there are such
things as bad manners.”
-4'ln a flash the pot was empty
and he was staring timelessly
into it as if lost in the gulf of
an old grief. I like people to
be happy when they are drink-
ing, and to smooth things out I
shouted again . , . quickly and
out of my turn.
Then it went around again
and happiness settled down
over us as easily as a plastic
raincoat. The offensive lout
moved away and our newr-
found friend shook-off his taci-
turnity and said to me between
drinks, “I’d like to have a yarn
to you sometime about the
’fields. I was there around the
time you tell of. No one in
Kaf’ ever saw that horse again.
I can vouch for that.”
“The world’s a small place,”
I said ; “it’s over twenty years
since I was there. I've even
forgotten what the Poet looked
like.”
AND so the drinks went
around. Then a pie-seller
came through the bar with
small home-made pies. I
(Continued col. 4 next page )


looked towards his basket and
then at my distinguished-look-
ing friend. He nodded.
“Thanks, I don’t mind if I do.”
Another round or two and
then came the chilling “Time,
gentlemen, please.” And so we
drifted apart.
The last of my companions
to leave me said: “A queer
customer, that pal of yours
from the Golden West. Did
you get the way he downed
his beer? He never even
swallowed.”
“No,” I quite truthfully
replied. “I drink much the
same way myself.”
My friend is one of the most
observant of men and as he
turned to catch his tram be
laughed. “And about that pie
you bought him —he took one
snap and it was gone.”
I tried to read some signifi-
cance into his statement, but
nothing would focus properly.
“What are you getting at?” I
said ; “do you think he was the
Poet?”
“No,” my friend said ; “he
was obviously the horse.”
His tram moved off before I
could ask him how he knew,
and next time I saw him he had
forgotten all about it.
Scientific School-training for Girls
By CATHERINE LEFEVRE
(Honorary research-worker, the Chemistry
School, Sydney University.) *
WHEN, in this techno-
logical age, a school-
girl shows marked
ability in any of the
sciences or in mathematics, it is
surely in the interests of her
country that she should be
given every encouragement to
develop her talents in order
that she may either play her
part directly in the scientific
economic expansion of her
country, or, if she marries,
indirectly by rearing her
children aided by the wider
of the con-
temporary world which her
training will have given her.
We are all aware that there
has been a survey' - of secondary
education in N. S. Wales and
that various recommendations
have been made by the
committee - of - inquiry in
particular, the suggestion that
the number of years of
secondary-school education be
extended by one. This recom-
mendation is most praise-
worthy, but also for many years
quite impracticable, if only for
the simple reason that there
aren’t enough school-teachers
to deal adequately with
secondary education as it now
stands.
A critical look at the
educational facilities in N. S.
Wales for girls at the secondary
level —girls who seek a scientific
career reveals a sorrowful
picture. It is only in some of
the coeducational country
high-schools and four metro-
politan girls’ schools that a
good basic knowledge of
the physical sciences and
mathematics can be obtained
in addition to the other subjects
which constitute a sound
general education. There is,
for instance, now in Sydney
only one girls’ school in which
physics is taught as a subject,
and only three in which
combined physics and chemistry
are studied to the honors level.
The laboratory facilities and
equipment for chemistry,
where they exist, are poor, and
in some schools mathematics
beyond the general-mathematics
level is not taught.
It was with these facts in
mind that an analysis of the
November, 1957, Sydney Uni-
versity examination results for
Chemistry I and “Junior”
Physics I was made for 114
women science-students. The
results are related to the
previous scientific instruction
the girls had received in their
schools, and cause and effect
are. clearly revealed in the
figures which follow:
subject in addition to Chemistry
and Mathematics I and 11.

It is seen that groups 1 and
2 constitute a sound basic
training for girls. Group 3 con-
stitutes a sound basic training
for chemistry, but not for
physics. Groups 4-9 indicate
lack of training in mathematics
or chemistry or physics, with
50 p.c. failure-rate.
Group 10 illustrates the hope-
lessness of an inadequate train-
ing in the physical sciences,
although in the biological
sciences this group obtained 16
passes and 7 credits, with the
relatively smaller number of
11 failures.
Of groups 1 and 2, half
attended coeducational country
high-schools where they bene-
fited from the same scientific
educational curricula as the
boys. The other half attended
the three girls’ high-schools in
Sydney in which in addition to
Maths. I and 11, Combined
Physics and Chemistry to
honors level is studied, and,
the one girls’ school in the
metropolitan area where
Physics is offered as a separate
of “More specific suggestions”
the recommendation that “All
secondary schools be co-
educational.” Surely in view of
the inadequate basic training
that our girls are receiving in
science, this is the only realistic
solution to the problem.
There is in N. S. Wales a
grave shortage of science-
teachers and facilities, but as
a careful look at the 1957
leaving-certificate examination
results will show, in different
schools throughout the State —
both private and public—there
obviously lies individual
strength in the teaching and
equipment. Surely those school-
children, boys and girls, who
have the ability and who at the
end of their third or even fourth
year express a wish for a
scientific career, could be
deployed for their instruction
to such centres.
The advantages would be
many. The children would
receive sufficient basic know-
ledge to bridge the gulf between
school and university courses,
with consequent reduction of
first-year university failure-rate.
The “receiving” schoolteachers
would be relieved in their
classes of the many disinterested
pupils who willy-nilly they now
carry under the present set-up.
The pupils themselves at an
impressionable age would
realise that if they wanted to
achieve their aim they must
earn the right by proving their
ability, a principle of which so
many of the present generation
seem to be blissfully unaware ;
and, finally, the doors would be
opened to those children to
whom at the moment a science
career is, in spite of their
ability, out of the question
because they can never hope
to receive the requisite inspira-
tion or instruction in their
school environments.
If the schools o£ N. S.
Wales, both public and private,
would share facilities and per-
sonnel, there would be less
blighting of the hopes of the
young, and a greater production
of the trained scientists this
country needs.


1888; his reviews of Lady Bellairs’s
“Gossips with Girls and Maidens,”
Miss Constance Naden’s “A Modern
Apostle and Other Poems,” and Phyllis
Browne’s “Life of Mrs. Somerville”
reassure the modern reviewer that
dullness in this trade does not preclude
his being a genius elsewhere . . .
although maybe there is a hint of levity
in:—
Lady Bellairs recognises the
importance of self-denial; and there
is a great deal of sound sense in
everything that she says about the
gradual growth and formation of
character. Indeed, those who have
not read Aristotle upon this point,
might with advantage read Lady
Bellairs,
There are quite a few complete
stories —a pre-“Sanders” African story'
by Edgar Wallace, from “The Story-
teller,” 1910; Chesterton’s best “Father
Brown” story; one by Dashiell
Hammett; a 1909 Spanish story by
Somerset Maugham; and the long
World War II airwardgn story by
Nicholas Monsarrat, “Heavy Rescue”;
but the anthology is made-up mostly of
excerpts chosen, as the thoughtful com-
piler, Fred Urquhart, puts it, as an
answer to the question: “Will this
excerpt encourage people to read the
complete book?” Well, whether or
not this happy result is achieved, the
selection makes an excellent bedside-
book.
Sir Winston Churchill is found urg-
ing Britons into war; the Aga Khan,
as a Persian scholar, wonders why his
friend Sir Winston thinks so highly of
Omar Khayyam; Hilaire Belloc
formally cuts-off the head of Charles
1; Howard Carter peers for the first
time into the tomb of Tutankhamen;
Beerbohm Tree meditates upon acting;
William Roughead considers a piece
of the tanned skin of Burke the
murderer; our own (if one may speak
so possessively about a Governor-
-General) Sir William Slim retreats into
India; Eric Gill enunciates some of
those theories about art which form
the basis of modem Catholic style;
F. L. Lucas studies Ronsard; J. M.
Barrie goes back to Thrums; the Duke
of Windsor remembers his life as a
naval cadet; Pola Gauguin says a few
words about -her father . . .
/Some idea of what is in the book
may be had from what the compiler
says has been left out: Hall Caine,
Kaiser William, Stanley Weyman. Ethel
M. Dell, the Earl of Birkenhead,
Baroness Orczy, E. Phillips Oppen-
heim, Earl Jellicoe, Dean Farrar,
Margot Asquith, Jerome K. Jerome—
to have people like that knocking
vainly upon your door: what
grandeur!
A Stallion Takes a Bath
“Mr. Shean.” said Mr. Gallagher,
“I got up.”
“Obviously.” said Mr. Shean, “or
you wouldn’t be here.”
“I did not reason why I got up,”
said Mr. Gallagher. “Instinct made
me do it.”
“Perhaps if you had reasoned you
could have stayed in bed,” said Mr.
Shean.
“Whether I did it by reason or by
instinct is immaterial,” said Mr.
Gallagher. “I got up. For centuries
past, my ancestors had been getting up
every morning. An age-old instinct
made them. Or reason.”
“This is very profound, so early in
the morning,” said Mr. Shean.
“Yes, isn’t it?” said Mr. Gallagher.
“Flocks of budgerigars, corellas, Major
Mitchells, crows, hawks, groundlarks,
quail, eagles, brolgas and mickeys were
whirling and whistling round my head
in countless millions. They woke me.”
“I’m not. surprised,” said Mr. Shean.
“But isn’t a mickey an animal of some
kind?”
“I’m not sure,” said Mr. Gallagher.
“Instinct doesn’t tell me. I must look
that up again in Henry G. Lamond.”
“Exactly what is all this about?”
said Mr. Shean. “You have been
reading Mr. Lamond?”
“Yes; but I am trying to tell you
that I had a bath this morning,” said
Mr. Gallagher.
“That’s all right, then. You’ve told
me,” said Mr. Shean.
“I haven’t even begun to tel] you,’*
said Mr. Gallagher. “That bath stood
there. Clouds of budgerigars and
carneys were whirling and wheeling
above it. It was steaming. I didn’t
need reason to tell me it was hot.
Instinct told me. I put my foot in it.
It was boiling. I muttered unspeak-
able obscenities. ‘Blast it!’ I said, and
hurled my pyjamas out the window.
They hit a corella.”
“This,” said Mr. Shean, “is a most
eventful bath.”
“More is to come,” said Mr.
Gallagher. “I turned-on the cold tap.
Clouds of goannas and tadpoles flew
up with a whirling scream. I stood
there naked in my pride and rage, six-
foot-eight of towering, resplendent
manhood. All my mares had retreated
to a decent distance.”
“I’m glad about that,” said Mr,
Shean.
“I whickered to them, wickedly,’*
said Mr. Gallagher. “They stamped
their hooves and whinnied. I pawed-up
the bathmat. Clouds of ibis and water-
beetles rose whirring round my
haunches. My mane bristled in the
breeze. There was a scar on my left
foreleg where my mare had hit me with
the toasting-fork. Cautiously I
plunged my off-hind-leg into the water
again. I swore. Bother it, it was too
cold now. I shivered. Instinct
suggested I should get back into bed.
But now there was a bull-camel in the
bed. Its odor was indescribable. I
shall describe it.”
“Don’t,” said Mr. Shean. “Aren’t
you ever going to get into that dashed
bath? Be a man.”
“I beg your pardon,” said Mr.
Gallagher. “I am a stallion. With one
almighty snort I leapt into that bath.
I scooped it up into my mouth with
a long loud sooping sound. I let it
dribble out my nostrils. Frogs
jumped into my ears. I lay on my back
and let the water roll to and fro across
my belly. I put soap on my hands and
applied the soap to my person. My
mares snickered softly. I kicked them.
Then I began to play in that bath. I
tossed the soap high in the air. I ate
it. I squatted on all fours and blew
bubbles. I sloshed. Screaming with
delight. I pulled the plug out with my
teeth. All the water ran out of the
bath. Instinct told me it would. I was
not surprised. Seven-feet of roaring
manhood, glistening with steam and
algae, I rose up and I got out of that
bath and 1 dried myself. I used a
towel.”
“I don’t suppose you would use a
pocket-handkerchief,” said Mr. Shean.
“Quite so,” said Mr. Gallagher, “but
I have just been trying to learn how
Mr. Henry G. Lamond writes those
excellent Nature-novels which Faber
and Faber publish one after another.
First it was a dingo and then it was
a sheep-dog and then it was a bull and
KANGAROOS
Brown out of the brown tussock a
darker brown
head rises as if thrust up cautiously on a
pole.
A green bird on a distant
grass-stem that bends gracefully under
its weight flutters
and flattens like a tethered butterfly. It
is the only
disturbance except for the reiterated
clickings clacking
of castanets and the shrill high wail of a
beetle’s -
dancing pipe.
One notices the brown head on the pole
gone,
pulled down out of sight quickly and all
over the unfurled
map of the paddock minute brown
figures, flags, dots jump, all diminishing

a maze
of crazy maplines, meaningless angles.
Or
the skin of the paddock is a deep fur
maddeningly come alive with deliberate
great fleas.

AUSTRALIA’S OUTLOOK ON ASIA
an outstanding analysis of the
Australian outlook on the near north
by WERNER LEVI
This is a shrewd, well-informed and enlightening analysis for all who are concerned about
Australia’s destiny as a responsible and influential Pacific power. It deals with Australia’s
attitude to Japan, the significance of the White Australia policy, the Colombo Plan, the
effect of Asian nationalism and many other questions. 27/6 (post 7d.)

now it is The Red Ruin Mare; and all
I can say is, I wouldn’t like to be
watched by Mr. Lamond while taking
my innocent morning plunge. He never
misses a detail.”
“But you don’t mean to tell me,”
said Mr. Shean. “that you didn’t enjoy
‘The Red Ruin Mare’ ?”
“Mr. Shean,” said Mr. Gallagher, “I
thought it was magnificent. There is
a stallion taking a bath; there are all
the birds, beasts and bugs of western
Queensland; there are appalling facts
about blowflies; there is—in one of the
surprising scenes Mr. Lamond always
provides, even when you know his
terrain pretty well—an emu killing a
cat. There is much strange and
authentic lore of horses; there are
corellas and budgerigars and fillies
playing with trousers, and countiy
dances and stockmen and camels and a
race-meeting where, needless to say,
Destitute, Red Ruin’s daughter, wins
the Ladies’ Bracelet. There is even,
right at the end, a heroic ride for the
doctor to save a woman stricken with
appendicitis. It is as sound a book
about horses and stockmen as I ever
read; and, if it is true in a sense that
Mr. Lamond writes the same book
each time, the amazing thing is how,
by his close observation of Nature,
he does manage to vary them. And,
I might add, to expand them.”
“I must read it,” said Mr. Shean.
“Do,” said Mr. Gallagher. “You
take that book in your right hand.
You blinki You open your eyes. You
scratch yourself. Delicately, with your
teeth, you pick the budgerigars out
of your hair. You whicker. You read
on and on and on.”
“But supposing,” said Mr. Shean,
“my mares whinny me to dinner?”
“Bite them on the rump,” said Mr.
Gallagher.
Thurber Album
Alarms and Diversions (Hamilton)
amounts to a James Thurber omnibus,
or, at any rate, anthology; his most
popular essays, stories and fantasies,
liberally spliced with his most famous
joke-blocks and series-cartoons, 367
pages in all.
It’s a bit late to discover this “New
Yorker” wit with his resigned and
sometimes disturbing presentation of
the everyday life of the well-heeled
middle-class magazine-journalist; and
it could be that most of these things
have faded a little in the past few
years. But not the essay on “Mr.
Punch”; time has made it even more
interesting.
From the viewpoint of a theoretically
classless American democrat he surveys
the “Punch” joke at the expense of
inferiors, and from the viewpoint of
the American, the “Punch” joke at the
expense of Americans: —
She owns she is “Amur’can,” and
her accent is alarming;
Her birthplace is an awful name
you pray you may forget;
Yet, after all, we own “La Belle
Americaine” is charming
So let us hope she’ll win at last her
long-sought coronet.
And “Punch’s” reply to Nathaniel
Hawthorne, who had said “English
girls seemed to me all homely alike.
They seemed to be country lasses, of
sturdy and wholesome aspect, with
coarse-grained cabbage-rosy cheeks
How unlike the trim damsels of
my native land!”
Mr. Punch hoped Hawthorne would
write his autobiography, as Mr. Punch
was “very partial to essays on the
natural history of half - civilised
animals.”
Or what Mr. Punch said about Abe
Lincoln; or how the “Fair New York
Millionairess,” asked hadn’t she
brought her father, replied: “Why,
no—Pa’s much too vulgar! It’s as
much as we can do to stand Ma!”
Thurber is, of course, much too
smooth to comment on these
researches.
WATER SKIER
Water fans apart and gasps
beneath the skiers’ blade-swift skill
and even the river’s wading reeds
gasp semaphores of praise at all
this rippling youth’s display and ease.
Firm and tanned beneath day’s curve
of sky the dexterous rider patterns
river-long his rapid love,
alive and flashing in the summer
reach ; and all his triumph is
this moment’s mastery of flesh ;
and here his only conquest lies.
Spelling the symbols of his pride
in water’s manuscript, he grooves
a trembling chapter with his skis
which, even as he laughs, dissolves.

Reviewed Briefly
The Knights of Bushido: Lord
Russell of Liverpool (Cassell). Sub-
titled “A Short History of Japanese
War Crimes,” this is a report of the
evidence given at the trials before the
International Military Tribunal, Far
East, reinforced with a history of
earlier crimes, such as the Nanking
massacre, and by some eye-witness
accounts of World War II atrocities
from the diaries of ex-p.-0.-w. It is
illustrated with photographs and may
be said faithfully to describe the
indescribable.
* * * *
Abyssinian Adventure: J. F. Mac-
Donald (Cassell). The history of “a
sideshow of a sideshow” —the campaign
against the Italians in Kenya during
World War 11, which the author
attended as a subaltern until, after
graduating to command of his company
in the battle of Uadara, he was
wounded in an ambush. It seems that
the combination of Italians and the
more appalling parts of Africa moves
most British authors, in desperation, to
humor; and MacDonald, if hardly as
hilarious as a Waugh, makes a very
amusing, adventurous book of it, as
much enlivened by herds of wild
elephants and hordes of wilder mos-
quitoes as by the elusive enemy.
* * * *
Up and Down Asia: George N.
Patterson (Faber). Anecdotes, mainly
light-hearted, by a medical missionary
who has written “Tibetan Journey”
and “God’s Fool.” He deals mostly
with the awkward situations in which
Far Eastern travel and his profession
have landed him—“ Arrested for Spy-
ing in Chungking”; “Anthropology in
a Calcutta Brothel”; and “A Night
with a Berserk Tibetan” —and makes
an exceptionally entertaining little
book of it.
