The Red Page
Walter Page
Surely Burton Hendrick’s Life and Let-
ters of Walter H. Page is one of the world s
best in biographies. Easy also for the com-
piler, for the book practically builds itself
out of the Ambassador’s letters to Wash-
ington during the five years preceding, and
covering all but the last few months of, the
war. It is thus autobiography, and auto-
biography of the only sort worth a tinker s
dam: in frankness, it is pure gold. Thanks
to the fact that Page found it impossible
to establish anything like sympathetic work-
ing relations with the State Department at
Washington (he could never get the. infor-
mation he sought from there; and his own
strictly-not-for-publication despatches from
London were fed to the American papers by
the deplorably leaky Bryan department), he
got into the habit of writing oflicial infor-
mation either direct to President Wilson or
indirectly to the “heads” through semi-pri-
vate but wholly-frank letters to his and
Wilson’s bosom friend, Colonel House. So
the world gets unrestrained and illuminat-
ing comment on the moving events of the
war —a combination of accurate news and
clear views penned by a great journalist on
the greatest men and events of his time and
ours, and in a manner and under conditions
which prove him to have been not the least
illustrious of a long line of able American
ambassadors to Britain. Roosevelt, indeed,
declared him to have been, with one excep-
tion, the greatest of them all.
The chief part of Page’s job, as he con-
ceived it, was to promote mutual respect
and friendly confidence between his country
and Britain. His countrymen regarded
John Bull’s pleasantest “Good morning” as
the salutation of a cunning old party with
an axe to grind. The trouble in Mexico was
directly charged to Britain’s thirst for oil;
that was why the well-bribed Huerta . was
giving so much “back chat” to President
Wilson. When Page, striving to keep the
peace, suggested that officialdom had no-
thing to go on but suspicion, he was accused
of Anglomania. Page remembered that
former ambassadors Russell Lowell and
Choate had been accused of the same offence,
and was not discouraged. . Then, just as
America was beginning to listen to reason,
Page found that the British Government,
while professing to value America’s friend-
ship and pooh-poohing the notion that high-
placed British officials were backing the oil
concessionaires, had sent Sir Lionel Carden
as British ambassador to Mexico. And
Carden had previously started a violent anti-
American propaganda in Cuba, and was re-
cognised everywhere as hostile to the u.S.,
an admirer and supporter of Huerta, and
more than suspected of friendliness to Brit-
ish company-promoters who had bought oil
concessions in Mexico! How Page, aided
by Sir Edward Grey, eventually saved the
fat from falling into the fire, and how Car-
den himself headed an ambassadorial depu-
tation to Huerta to advise him to vacate the
“throne,” makes an interesting story.
The outbreak of war found the ex-edxtor
of the Atlantic and the World’s Work,
not only U.S. Ambassador, but “German
Ambassador” also. Naturally, his troubles
multiplied. British warships, controlled by
a Government that felt that every pound
of lead or cotton or foodstuff imported by
the Central Powers would help to lose the
war for the Allies, seized American cargoes
on the high seas. Page, as in duty bound,
protested against this “piracy,” as American
consignees called it. He had to fight the
British War Office and also Edward Grey,
the best British friend America possessed,
And all the time he was writing despairful
letters to the American “heads” imploring
them to go slow on mere irritation out-
bursts calculated to please nobody but a few
dollar-grabbing Yankee-German traders and
estrange British statesmen “.who desire to
retain America’s friendship, and have proved
it, hut who will fight her, if necessary, rather
than permit contraband to reach Germany,
either directly or by ‘continuous voyage.’ ”
In the middle of long-drawn-out and fine-
spun legal arguments about contraband and
kindred subjects came the sinking of the
Lusitania (May 7, 1915), and the commence-
ment of Wilson’s Note-writing period. Six
months later the Ancona followed the Lusi-
tania, then the Falaba, the Gulf-light, the
Arabic, the Hesperian and others. And the
President kept on writing Notes. Page pro-
tested. This Note-writing was undermining
British respect for America. Why did not
the President send Bernstorff packing? Why
listen to his lying assertions that submarin-
ing neutrals was to be, and had been, dis-
continued? For a year Page felt that he
was avoided by British friends: he dropped
out of everything but purely official func-
tions. In 1916 he visited the U.S. to talk
to the President. Wilson listened .to him
courteously enough, but the old friendship
was broken. The President was unim-
pressed. He clearly regarded Page as an
incurable Anglomaniac. And Page regarded
Wilson as a sad and lonely man, the prey
of myriads of small-minded wirepullers, dull
and distressed, but plodding on in a pathetic
desire to stop the war —pacifist at almost
any price.
In November, 1916, after Wilson’s re-elec-
tion, Page wrote the President offering to
resign. The letter was a review of the rea-
sons why the U.S. should join the Allies.
That this letter strongly influenced Wilson
is shown by the incorporation of practically
every suggestion it contained into the Pre-
sident’s famous declaration of April 2, 1917,
which brought America into the war. The
day before the speech to Congress Page sum-
med up Wilson in this way:—
In the beginning he bad made—as far as it was
possible —neutrality a positive quality of mind
He really suppressed speech and thought. The
second error he made was in thinking that he could
play a great part' as peacemaker to these erring
children... .There was a condescension in this attitude
that was offensive. He shut himself up with these
two ideas and engaged in what he called
“thought.” The air currents of the world never
ventilated his mind He has not breathed a spirit
into the people: he has encouraged them to supine-
ness. He is not a leader, but rather a stubborn
phrase-maker.
But after the declaration of war everything
was changed, especially the Ambassador’s
life in London. “Theatres offer me boxes,
universities offer me degrees, hospitals solicit
visits, clubs offer me dinners —I’ll have to
get a new secretary or two well-trained to
‘No’ politely, else I shall not have my work
done.”
Balfour’s mission to America (May, 1917)
was a serious affair, but the Britisher got a
laugh out of it. He was interviewing Frank
L. Polk, Counsellor of the State Department
at Washington, on shipping problems, etc.:
“Before I go,” he said, “there is—er —one subject
I would —er —like to say something about.”
“I know what you have in mind,” said Polk,
in his characteristic quick way. “You want us to
apply your black list to neutrals.”
In other words the British hoped that the U.S.,
now it was in the war, would adopt against South
America and other offenders those same discrimi-
nations which the U.S. had so fiercely objected to
when it was itself a neutral. _ ,
Balfour gave Polk one of his most winning smiles
and nodded. . .
“Mr. Balfour,” said Polk, “it took Great Britain
three years to reach a point where it was prepared
to violate all the laws of blockade. You will find
that it will take us only two months to become as
great criminals as you are !”
Walter Page resigned in August, 1918, broken
in health. In October he sailed for home
on the Olympic. The captain, hearing that
Page had a great yearning to reach his be-
loved North Carolina, cut a day off his
scheduled time on the voyage. The sick
man was carried down the gang-plank on a
stretcher —too weak to travel further than
the nearest hospital. He did get home to
North Carolina (December 12), but he was
“all out,” and died nine days later.
W. A. WOODS.
Poets and Publishing
What I know about writing verse will
always, it seems to me, be a matter for heated
discussion ; but printing, publishing and selling
verse are matters of which I claim to have
some knowledge, and I know that Dora
Wilcox’s and Israel Zangwill’s solution of
the poet’s difficulties is not a solution at ail.
Producing the book is not the problem; the
problem is to find a public for it.
I have been printing for many years books
of verse by Australian poets, and I have not
solved anything so far. We have had kind
things said about the “production” of these
books, kinder things than the books deserved
(the reason being that not one Australian
printer in a hundred knows how to print a
book, and ours seemed good by comparison) ;
but the contents of the books are reviewed
incompetently ; and, finally, no one buys them.
All the best things in the world are done
for nothing; but Australian poets must pay
for the privilege of»doing things for nothing.
That is no exaggeration. Far from getting
any reward for their work, in no instance
has a writer got more than a fraction of his
money back. And I say it again. Certain
ordinary technical knowledge having been
acquired, producing the book is the smallest
difficulty. A book demands readers. How
are we to find the audience? Advertising is
impossible on account of expense, and the
results are not satisfactory when the expense
is undertaken. Personal circulars are equally
useless. No section of the public seems to
care whether verse is good or bad —which
seems natural. They don’t want it at all.
I demand both an “artistic” and a com-
mercial success. Poets have to drudge in
shops and offices to be able to afford to give
away the books that should be a source of
income to them. I am not expecting a “best
seller” circulation for a book of verse. lam
looking for an intense and limited public of
about 350 that will pay for a book and keep
a poet from losing his money. That would
solve some things; but as all poetry lovers
do not like the same poets we would make
the audience 500 and allow for 150 non-
attendances. There is plenty of worthless
stuff published that deserves to remain un-
sold, but I am not talking about that. I
have as an amateur printer occasionally
made a few pounds on the books I have
printed for other people. At other times I
have lost a few pounds; but with books of
my own stuff, cutting out absolutely the cost
of labor, I have not received in return enough
to pay for the material. We have used many
devices, reduced editions to the lowest pos-
sible minimum, cut out every outside ex-
pense (one poet came here in his spare time
and bound his own book in boards) and tried
to give the public value for its money. But
the public doesn’t want value for its money.
To create a public would solve all the diffi-
culties that confront us. There is no public
now. Neither commercial publishing, com-
mission publishing nor private printing and
private publishing can bring even an “artis-
tic” success. The poets themselves seem to
be' the only people interested in Australian
poetry, and they can’t live by taking in one
another’s washing—if they have any. A
person who pays 3s. 6d. or ss. for a book of
Australian verse is not paying the cost of the
book even at that price; it is usually a pre-
sent from the author. Giving people for
nothing things that they want is a great
pastime for a millionaire philanthropist, but
to give the public for nothing that which it
does not want is—what ? I don’t know;
but that is what the Australian verse-writers
do.
Even the community business does not
work. Though one and perhaps all may get
many hours of happy work from it, that hap-
piness is not the aim. The aim is to publish
books of poetry and keep them away from the
pulping mills. Our Melbourne community-
song was the little verse-paper Birth, pub-
lished by the Melbourne Literary Club. _ The
Club sold Birth to such of the public as
wanted it —and lost money and weight in the
effort. (So there were two more things for
our wives to worry about.)
The question before us, then, is the ques-
tion before the Australian poet who pub-
lishes a book to-day: how are the people in-
terested in our work to be informed of our
existence? Dora Wilcox will have to think
out something other than private printing.
Does the trouble lie in the quality of the
work? Kendall does not sell; Brennan does
not sell; Victor Daley does not sell. Nobody
that’s any good sells; and hundreds of books

that are bad enough to be popular don t sell
either.
One suggestion I can put forward. If the
reviewers had a little more knowledge and
went to more pains and were a trifle more
conscientious and kept on being so tor 1U
consecutive years, the position might begin
to consolidate. People do not take notice or
reviewers because they have been had so
many times. The swans turned out to be
geese, and the tiger was an interesting little
Persian kitten. But sometimes the swan was
a kitten and the tiger a goose, or the son of
a goose. Most of our leading papers are very
generous, very kindly—but they are not seri-
ously interested. I speak for the veterans
at our time of life we prefer scorn to polite
encouragement. There is no authority, and
when the reviewers want to praise a writer
they need not, by implication, curse every
poet in the landscape. We are always being
told that we have no Shakspeares or Shelleys
in this country. The poets can retort that
neither have we any George Saintsburys,
Sainte Beuves or Matthew Arnolds. A litera-
ture cannot come into being without criti-
cism. The foundations of Australian litera-
ture have been laid, but the foundations of
Australian criticism have not been thought
of. I think this is the root of the trouble.
I am not making a public appeal for the
writers whose poetry I have had something
to do with —none of them is poor enough yet
to need that —but good work deserves its
pay; and if any Bulletin reader feels in-
clined to order a few dozen to give to his
friends at Christmas he can rest assured that
he gets value for his money, and that the
whole of the proceeds will go direct to the
author without any deduction. But you must
address Endacott, the publisher, direct. It is
futile to rail at the bookseller; he also has
been had many times. He will not buy books
of poetry outright; he will, mostly, accept
them on sale or return, but he does not take
a very vital interest in sale-or-return, books.
And when an author asks for his own book
which he knows is in the shop he can hardly
blame the assistants for forgetting things
they handle so very rarely, and which get
worn out with disuse.
EURNLEY MAURICE.
“The Outside Men"
Of the making of New Guinea books there
is no end. It is more than questionable
whether some of these works have justified
themselves; but that certainly cannot be
said of Patrolling in Papua, by W. R. Hum-
phries (Fisher Unwin), which will stand
as a true and unaffected record of the work
of what the author calls “The Outside Men”
—the subordinate officers of isolated dis-
tricts who do their work for civilisation in
festering sago-swamps and on cloud-swept
mountain-crags, without any advertising or
much material reward.
Books dealing with Papua may be roughly
divided into four categories. There are the
natural-history section and the missionary-
propaganda class; fiction avowed or mas-
querading as fact; and such works of general
interest as those of Hubert Murray, Beaver
and one or two others. Mr. Humphries’s
book differs from these last; for, though
there are one or two interludes on matters
general and particular, the mass of the
work is devoted to the story of one journey
across the island from the Gulf of Papua
to Morobe, on the north-east coast of New
Guinea, in what was once German territory.
The distance could be covered in a day by
a conscientious crow, though, like Mr. Hum-
phries, he would have to carry his own
rations. It took the author ,22 utterly
strenuous days, for in between was a tangled
mass of mountains 12,000 feet high, and
even under the equator the cold and ever-
lasting wet of these altitudes are a night-
mare.
Mr. Humphries, an “unfit,” took the place
of a man who had gone to France on
business. He found a list of “suggested
patrols” in his new r quarters. Quite naturally
he set off on the tremendous undertaking
with the whole of his available forces. These
consisted of a cookboy, six black police, 17
prisoners from the gaol, mostly murderers,
to carry supplies, and Funnyface, a dog
of parts and character. Many times food-
less, for days drenched and chilled to the
bone in the never-ending rainstorms on the
mountain-tops, through country bare of
human life or so full of it as to be a far
greater menace to the party, Humphries
struggled on. He came at last to his jour-
ney’s end without losing a man or having
to fire a shot in defence. Yet it was touch
and go. Well down the eastern slope the
party came to a wide, rolling valley, rich
in gardens and full of hostile bowmen, who
had in earlier days, as was known after,
been roughly handled by the Germans. There
came an hour when Humphries found him-
self beset in front and rear and on one flank
by hundreds of armed savages. On the
other flank, at the foot of a thousand-foot
precipice, the Waria River ran roaring to
the sea. Then from the mass of bowmen
ahead came running two panting natives
“in singlets and knickers.” They were “salt-
water boys” who knew the British Govern-
ment and the warlike tribesmen. In 10
minutes everyone was a brother. Food was
forthcoming; the end in sight was good—
quite unlike anything that had promised so
short a while before. There were still diffi-
culties, but not of man’s making; and in due
course the fever-stricken, ragged, starving
gang came safe to haven at Morobe. After
that it was easy to return to Port Moresby
over Sir William Macgregor’s old “road”
from the Mambare. through the Yodda, over
a trifling 6000 ft. “gap” in the great range,
“and so home.” What seems to have im-
pressed Humphries more than anything else
was the fact that w r hen he borroived a plan-
tation horse and rode the last few miles
into Port, his wife cut him dead. She was
taking the evening air with some other ladies,
and when the frowsy object on the old white
horse took off its dreadful hat, there was
a collective glassy eye that froze the mar-
row in the wayfarer’s bones.
The book has plenty of good little stories.
This one every old Papuan will appreciate.
A native _ constable had caught a fish and
brought it to Humphries’s cook-boy. He
began to tell this potentate how to clean
it, when the chef broke in, “Take a tumble
to yourself, you big yob; you’re a police-
man, not a cook. You may know all about
cleaning a rifle, but what the do you
know about cleaning a fish?” It was not
said in just those words; I have tried to
render “Police Motu” into the vernacular.
A book to be given a hearty welcome, and
to be enjoyed by the general public as well
as by old Papuan hands—the which is not
invariably the rule with volumes on Papua.

No Poetry Wanted
The Times Literary Supplement, in re-
viewing some modern plays, declares that
the present-day writer for the stage regards
himself as debarred from poetry; and thus,
in an art of words, he feels that he is shut
out from the loveliest places, as the great
Elizabethans and even the eighteenth-century
dramatists were not. The Avriter of the
article puts his finger on the weak spot in
modern life —the deliberate shutting out of
the highest and most beautiful on the ground
that it is impracticable. Even the practical
man of affairs, if hard pushed, will grudg-
ingly admit that poetry is one of the world’s
fairest possessions. He does not make the
admission as a mere axiom of the schools,
but because in his heart he holds it true.
Some time in his life he has been lifted high
enough to get a vision of what poetry might
be. He has never followed that vision, but
he is sure it is there to follow if he had the
time and opportunity. In the remarkable
confession of Darwin that he had become
merely a terribly efficient scientific machine,
he recalled the fact that poetry once thrilled
him. Even as you read the confession of his
growing human limitations you feel that this
great pathfinder knew that he had sacrificed
a little too much in the cause of knowledge,
knew that there was something sweet and
noble he had missed, and that that some-
thing was, after all, more important than his
collection of data for scientific ends. Every
man of full mental stature would be prepared
to admit this; yet poetry is under the world’s
ban as it never was in any previous age.
True, there is much poetry written —more
perhaps than at any time —but it is forced
to remain in holes and corners, not given the
place of honor and pride. Scarcely a pub-
lisher in the w’orld will accept a volume of
verse for publication on its merits; fiction
continually takes precedence of poetry in so-
called literary reviews; the poet himself is
rarely, if ever, sought out for public honor.
The business world does not want poetry,
the world of affairs professes to have no use
for it, the journalistic world as often as not
greets it with a half-sneer; yet, paradoxical
as it may seem, all men really want it and
are a little ashamed of that want. Athens,
as wide awake in public affairs, business and
general human activity as any modern State,
could appoint its favorite dramatic poet to
leadership in war, certain that the genius
of the man would be no more found wanting
than would the gallantry of the soldiers
under his command. Sophocles did not wish
to be made a general any more than modern
poets desire public honors. It is not the
poet himself who loses so greatly by public
neglect; it is the public that misses its best
in not honoring the highest thing of which
it has knowledge. But the general public
may be easily forgiven in this matter, for in
regard to poetry it is only following the lead
of a literary public which should both know
and do better. The Hebrew power, which for
a half-century or more has had a strong grip
on the theatre, may be blind and deaf to the
best the footlights are capable of showing;
but their blindness and deafness is also to
be forgiven if those who write of the theatre
agree with them in the suppression of what
is best.
Honestly viewed, the restoration of poetry
to its ancient throne is one of the great
needs of the time. To the American maxim
of “Do it now,” the world’s business and
pleasure runs fast and faster in ever-
increasing circles. But where is it all going,
what is it all about? The only possiole
answer would seem to be that the big
machinery of progress is no more than the
running round of ants on an antheap unless
out of all the bustle the finer things emerge
and remain. A world that denies or ignores
its best must soon tire of its eternal struggle.
C. O. M.
Bitter Herbs
There are some signs which seem to indi-
cate that the overwhelming wave which swept
across our times has spent the first fury of
its onset. Or, to use another metaphor, the
wind of Destructive Revolution is already
dying down. Even at the beginning of this
century European life was still rather like a
landscape, certainly charming, but undeni-
ably tame. The hillsides were green, the
paths through the wild wood kept in good
order, the hedges neatly trimmed. From
velvety lawns and beds of flowers rose
“gentlemen’s residences,” large and stately,
whose owners moved graciously through lives
of cultured ease. But beyond the hill there
were horrible manufacturing towns, slums,
dirt and disease; underneath the earth the
miners toiled like moles far from the light
of day; and even in the shadow of the great
houses there were damp cottages where over-
worked men and wbmen bred unwholesome
children. Far away upon the horizon the
storm muttered, but only a few heeded. At
last it .broke, and the very face of the world
was changed. Not only mansions have been
destroyed, but many cottages, too, and many
of the factories beyond the hill. And the
miners were flooded out of the mines to face
thunder and devastating lightning. For the
storm brought war, pestilence and famine
with it. and the stench of dead bodies was
stronger than the smell of ancient hidden
corruption.
Men’s ideas of Music, Art and Literature
changed, too, and they began to find beauty
in the movement of blasted trees savagely
buffeted by the wind, in crash and clash and
noise, and in the rattle of dead men’s bones.
Now, it seems, there is a period of repose.
Perhaps it is only the lull before the tempest
that will utterly destroy us all; or perhaps
it is the beginning of a peaceful age when
grass and flowers will spring up to hide the
tormented earth, and men will build again,
perhaps better than ever before.
It is a far cry from the music of the older
singers to the poems of Mrs. Dawson-Scott,
wife of the Tasmanian-born son of a veteran
of the Maori Wars. Yet they in themselves
are the outcome of a counter-revolution
against the modern Gospel of Ugliness. If
they are free from the trammels of rhyme,
they are by no means formless, and they are
based upon a delicate and ever-changing sys-
tem of rhythm. The following, from the
verses called “Danger,” give a good idea of
Mrs. Dawson-Scott’s method:
AVhile Dian keeps
Her tryst with young Endymion in the fields,
The crescent swings,
Redeless,
Across the starry way;
And I who climbed
To bed me deep
In down of a spent blossoming,
I drift....
The majority of the poems in Bitter Herbs
(Heinemann) are dramatic in subject, and
they are dramatically treated. Amongst the
Pyrenees, in the fierce days of summer, one
does not walk upon grass, but upon bitter
herbs; and the pungent odor of rue and
lavender and thyme rises above the dry, hot
earth from broken plants bruised under heel.
“The Day,” “The Knife-grinder” and
“Beloved \Vife of ” are curiously vivid
and arresting; and the last-named is success-
ful in giving not only the movement of a
drama, but the psychology of its persons, in
a very concentrated form. The rue is
crushed, but a whiff of its essence is caught,
mounting towards the hard and cruel sky.
There is no sentimentality about Mrs. Daw-
son-Scott’s work:
I taake it ’ard,
’Er at the ’orspital,
Goin’ from bad to worse an’ didn’ send ;
An’ now she’m dead.
What did I do?
No more’n others; still,
They extry women, they'm the deuce!
Adam, he held to Eve, he did.
Because the Lord had made ’n, one by one;
An’ yet I lay
The man went often to his garden hedge
An’ 100ked....
When ’er went
To Plymouth ’orspital, I ’ung about
’Opin’ ;
But ’er put ’ome the door.
Went down the path.
Five week to ’orspital,
An’ not a word !
Sent for ’er children. So ’el' knowed
It were the end.
I taake it hard that she should pass
Like that....
“Beloved wife of Job Nancarrow!”
I shall cut ’n deep
In stone;
An’ when at Judgment Day
She ’eave ’er ’ead up, they black dauntin’ words,
’Tis they will speak.
DORA WILCOX.
Ibanez Comes South
The cables say that Vincente Ibanez is
coming to Australia. Although he lives in
the older world, where the literature and art
of centuries have been inspired and created,
he is turning his pen to the colorful “new”
southern lands for the background of his
new books. And somehow I feel that there
is a great significance behind this trend to
the southern countries. Perhaps the old
world is really “old,” and perhaps the pulse
of inspiration has moved south ! It is cer-
tain that many of the great books of the last
80 years have been written by men who
shook off the manacles of civilisation in the
old world, to cross the equator and roam
among the Pacific Islands, or on the
“colonial” acres from which we grow our
bread and butter. Stevenson came this way,
and his South Sea Island books glow with
color, as much alive as the colors of Samoa
itself. Rupert Brooke came south and his
poetry took on a glorious new note when the
cool, adventurous breezes of the Pacific en-
riched its setting. One of the greatest novels
I have read for some time, De Matto’s trans-
lation of “The Hidden Force,” by Louis
Couperus, drew its color from Java. This is
a story of modern Javanese life, and the
mighty beauty of the story places it among
the few great novels of the past two years.
Louis Couperus came south to find his inspi-
ration. Joseph Hergesheimer left America
and went to Cuba to write the year’s great-
est travel book, “San Cristobal de la
Habana”; and, in a different way, Robert
Keable broke into the silences of Africa to
find a place where he was to write “Simon
Called Peter” and “The Mother of All Liv-
ing.” When he was banned to the extent of
being a best-seller, he came to Australasia
and the Pacific, and a letter he wrote me a
few weeks ago shows that he is still in
Tahiti, living away from towns and crowds
and other such.
It is this breaking away that is bringing
new color into the literature of our parent
England and her neighbors. Now Ibanez —-
the great Ibanez, who is the finest literary
jewel in the crown of modern Spain—opens
his atlas, places his finger on Australia, and
is conscious of the magnet, drawing him
south. Of characterisation in his novels
Ibanez has said:
Although I draw my characters from life, I do
so only in a very fragmentary way (like all the
great creative novelists whom I admire as masters
in the field of fiction), using the materials gathered
in my observations to form completely new types
which .are the direct and legitimate offspring of my
own imagination. To use a figure, as a novelist I
am a painter, not a photographer.
Maybe when he has gathered his store of
color and his harvest of impressions, he will
give literature a great Australian novel. It
would be better to have it done well by a
Spaniard than badly done by somebody
nearer home.
HEOTOR BOLITHO.
The Mysterious Affair at Styles, by Agatha Christie
(John Lane). A detective yarn, whose merit lies
in the author’s capacity to keep youl guessing till
the end. Of course there is an ~ incredibly clever
sleuth who can draw the most amazing deductions
from things you wouldn’t notice —-and who would
be wrong 99 times out of 100 if the story didn’t
require that he should be right. The writer of the
detective yarn has lots of advantages over the
detective.
Ermytage and the Curate, by A. M. Cogswell
(Australasian Publishing Co.). Ermytage, a school-
master, didn’t want to go to the war, and Fafte
played him a dirty trick by shunting him into the
same Labor corps as the local curate who had made
such unpleasant remarks about slackers. It is
really another indictment of war—or, rather, of the
way wars are mismanaged by nations which are un-
prepared, and which in the rush and the wire-pulling
constantly drop round pegs into square holes —or,
better perhaps, put hogs into dog-kennels. Presum-
ably Cogswell lays to his book; if he does there
are horrors of the war still to tell —horrors endured
even by men who wdre never in the line, and most
of them due to the arrogance and stupidity of
officers who, doubtless because they were known to be
arrogant and stupid, were kept on Labor-corps
jobs—there was no one else to do them. AA'ar is
hell; but unpreparedness is the very devil.

Great financial resources, mammoth factories
equipped with modern, labour-saving machinery,
and a world-wide demand for its product—all
enable Studebaker to manufacture motor cars on
a most efficient and economical basis. Savings
resulting from such advantages are returned to
the product in the form of greater value.
For seventy-one years, the Studebaker name has
stood for highest quality and value. Your inspec-
tion of Studebaker cars will convince you, we
believe, that the maximum of motor car value is
found in the three Studebaker chassis types,
embracing twelve body styles.

THIS IS A STUDEBAKER YEAR


e
Modern Companies prefer to recruit
the executive staff from the ranks
wherever possible. “Given two men
of equal experience, the trained man
is the man to promote,” said the
Managing Director of one £4,000,000
industry.
Have they got you safely tagged?
AGAIN AND AGAIN, in
directors’ rooms, this con-
versation is heard:—
First Director: “I wonder
whether the man we are look-
ing for isn’t in our own
organisation ? How about
Johnson?”
Second Director: “I don’t see
how we could consider him.
He is just a salesman”; or “He
is just an accountant”; or “He
is just an engineer.”
So Johnson, who has made a
creditable record, is passed over
in favor of someone from the
outside. His job has tagged him
and pigeonholed him. He has
done the work for which his
superiors employed him so well
that they think of him as a fix-
ture in that work.
A Man Who Refused to be
Tagged.
We have in mind a young man
who has not yet passed his
thirtieth birthday, and who is
already senior partner in a large
firm and chairman of a State
Accountancy Board—let us call
him Roberts.
How does a man reach a
position of responsibility and
profit at an early age? He began
in the accounting department of
a large company, and might
easily have continued to be
hidden there for the rest of his
business life. But looking around
him he saw the tags being tied
constantly and more firmly on
to men; he saw the danger of
letting it be said, ‘‘Roberts is a
good accountant, but of course
he’s just an accountant.” He
determined to do something
while he still had youth and
energy to keep himself from be-
ing tagged.
The “something” consisted in
Sending for ‘Forging Ahead in
Business.”
In the pages of “Forging
Ahead in Business,” a booklet
published and distributed by the
Alexander Hamilton Institute,
Mr. Roberts read the story of the
Modern Business Course and
Service. He made a decision
then, and three years later he
wrote this letter: —
“It has been on my mind for
some time to write and express
to you my sincere appreciation
of the assistance and inspiration
your Service has been to me in
the past few years.
“When I enrolled for the
Modern Business Course and
Service I had been specialising
for some time in accounting. The
deeper I got into it the more I
realised the danger of specialis-
ing too much. I could feel that I
was creating a limitation for my-
self. I realised that to make a
really large success in business I
must be able to read the story
behind all the figures that were
to come under my supervision,
and not be content to be merely a
good compiler of figures. . . .”
The Executive Wears No Tag.
The Alexander Hamilton
Institute gave him the thing he
needed. It did not make him a
salesman, but it gave him the
fundamentals of merchandising
and sales management; it did not
make him a factory superinten-
dent or office manager, but it
taught him the essentials of fac-
tory and office control; it did not
make him a banker, but it gave
him the outstanding principles
of corporation finance. In a
word,' it fitted him to be an
executive—to employ specialists
and direct them.
That is the service of the Alex-
ander Hamilton Institute in a
nutshell. It takes the man who
is in danger of being tagged as
“only a salesman’’ or “only an
engineer,’’ and provides him
with a working knowledge of
every other department of busi-
ness. Such information makes
itself apparent in every talk be-
tween a man and his superiors;
it is the one certain means of
attracting notice and inviting
promotion.
Send for the Book He Sent for.
The Alexander Hamilton In-
stitute offers to every thoughtful
man a copy of the book for
which Mr. Roberts sent, “Forg-
ing Ahead in Business.’’ The
book is never sold; it is sent
gladly to any man who will give
it an hour of his time. The
rewards of executive training are
so large, and the number of men
who have it relatively so few,
that it will be worth your while
to send for this book, no matter
what your position in business.
For your convenience
a coupon is attached. Fill it in,
and the book will be mailed
immediately, without obligation
to you.

Dark Days.
We lose our souls in these ignoble streets;
Pierced by the wind and harried by the
rain,
Meagre and wan we peevishly complain,
Or, muffled up within, are counterfeits;
Our petty instincts take the upper seats,
And we are menials. Dark days numb the
brain,
Dry up the heart springs, cradle every
pain
And hale unhappy thoughts from their re-
treats.
Oh, for that loveliness in folds of light,
That birth of wonder, with a flush and
fling
Of buds and blossoms and the scents of
Spring
lo bid us taste the ravishment and might
Wherewith the starry legions dance and
sing
And shed their rapturous glory through the
night!

Grass Trees.
‘Australian grass-trees belong to a very ancient
\\oiiu. I heir nearest relatives are mostly fossil
forms in the strata of remote geological periods.”
These old black stems have laughed the ages
down.
The world of Pharaoh was but yesterday,
The cave-man’s Europe scarce a month
away
In the slow' reckoning of the blades that
crown
Their heads with rustling green. Warm seas
could drown
Lost continents, and with a gentle play
Re-make them while the grass-trees loved
to sway
In windy whispers over slopes of brown.
And this good winter, after drought and fire,
They raise their blossom-spears against the
sky,
All white with downy softness; and their
friends,
The great red-gum trees, near them laugh
and sigh,
Marking their million years of brave desire
Still lifting lifeward unto gracious ends.

Magic.
It was no lark that sang the song
That ripples gladness in my heart,
Making each pulsing vein seem strong
With cadences of purest art.
No ; but your voice, your gentle voice,
That makes the world with music throng,
And me rejoice.
It was no rose so sweetly filled
The air with fragrances that wed
Its charm, whilst every sense was thrilled
T With dreams of earth wfith gardens spread.
No; it was you, the sweetness you
Have in my heart so freely spilled,
That gardens grew.
The sun gives not the pleasant glow'
That makes the warmth in which I move;
But all this ecstasy I know
Lives wfflen your tenderness I prove;
And your bright eyes—your love-lit eyes—
Are stars that light (I love you so),
My paradise!
On faery seas in magic ships
I sail ’midst lands unknown before;
The world of men behind me slips,
And leaves me this enchanted shore
Which you have lent, your love has lent.
Oh, I could die upon your lips
And be content!

Night.
There is a forest where great creatures
move—
Blurred outlines and with feathers on their
feet —
To unlit shrines beneath the shuddering trees,
And make their footfalls silent to the bats
That hang like vampires hungering for blood,
While in the black boughs group the ghosts
of moons
(That might be watchful eyes of mighty owls,
With gripping talon and revengeful beak),
Or where the ground is sown with little
stars
That are but lanterns of the pranksome elves,
Entangling the clues to dreams fulfilled
In the thick maze about the forest roots.
Oh, it is from this wood that night comes
forth,
A capuchin, wrapped in liis cloak and hood,
Whose hidden face may bear the seal of rest
Or of sharp agony and stark despair!
There is a pleasant field of buttercups
And saffron daisies and tall iris blooms
And cannas, yellow as a mandarin,
As subtly scented with the golden East;
With luteous petalled lilies and a rose
That is the rose of Persia, crocus-hued.
And this gold field is hedged with lemon-trees,
Bit with the ripened fruit, or quinces webbed
With aureate down upon the brown-stemmed
rods,
And oranges effacing yellow plums
With burning splendors! From this prim-
rose place
Comes morning with her cadmium-colored
robe,
And with no veil to dim her shining face.
Yet from this yellow field we turn aside,
Eyes aching from the green (the golden
smile
Swept like a lantern o’er our nakedness).
Feeling a need within our wayward hearts
For those dark woods where formless crea-
tures move
And there are rustlings of vague, unseen
things,
Trails unexplained and shadow shapes of
dreams!

LAND-GRANT RAILWAYS.
A mournful gentleman, one of the members
for the North-West in Westralia’s down-in-
a-corner Parliament, spoke a few words re-
cently in the press to the effect that his
region, like the Northern Territory and the
north-west of Queensland, is steadily going
back on any little progress it made in days
before such an appalling amount of money
was borrowed for “development.” His remedy
was the usual one —that some benevolent
person should come along to assist. British
and Commonwealth money, he held, should
be “poured into” this splendidly fertile
region, which has become a mere loss and
reproach, like all of Australia’s good lands,
without exception, that have the misfor-
tune to be misdirected from very remote
State capitals. Presumably it is loan money
that is to be poured in, if it can be got, and
provided it isn’t ail wanted by people with a
“pull” in the vicinity of the State metropo-
lis. Yet. when one comes to think over the
matter, enough has been poured into the
North already to buy success twice over if
it had only been differently applied. Now,
unless the old system can be reversed and
the old policy done away with, the chance is
about finished, for the old policy has burst,
and the old ways are worn out, used up and
exhausted. This is about the measure of
the situation :
The country’s credit and its capacity for absorbing
paper money are approaching exhaustion, and practi-
cally everything has been spent on an infinitesimal
corner of the vast Commonwealth, where all the State
capitals, and the proposed Federal capital, and the
overwhelming majority of the pottering politicians
are. A line drawn from the old convict settlement
of Moreton Bay to the similar institution of Perth
still represents the limits of any serious effort at real
settlement.
The country’s taxpaying capacity, except perhaps
in one State, shows signs of approaching the limit
also. Partly through building dozens of railways
that lead to stumps and dead-ends instead of open-
ing feasible ports, and partly through other forms
of imbecility and log-rolling, the amount of unpro-
ductive taxes that are levied to support allegedly
“reproductive” works has become remarkable. N. S.
Wales claims to have the best-paying of the railway
systems, and there is talk of raising another million
per annum to keep the best-paying system out of
the poorhouse.
The rulers, through long adherence to the stuffy
street existence, have lost any pioneering habit they
ever possessed.
• * * *
In the circumstances Australia is driven to
consider the possibility of the private build-
ing and ownership and working of railways
on the land-grant system. Thirty years ago
such an idea would have been scouted, but
30 years ago so-called public ownership
hadn’t become the monstrous fraud and dis-
grace of later years. The present position
is that, if Australia had private land-grant
railways, the community would own them at
least as much as it does the public systems
—that is to say, it wouldn’t own them at all.
The public systems belong to the public
creditor: last year Australia possessed 260
millions’ worth (cost price). of railways and
tramw’ays, and owed 300 millions to outside
creditors alone to account for them. And as
even N. S. Wales possessed 29 . lines which
were worth less than nothing, inasmuch as
they earned neither interest nor working
expenses, the position is that under public
proprietorship the public really owns less
than no railways. Under private proprietor-
ship it couldn’t own less, and in fact it
couldn’t own so little. A long time ago the
great supporters of public ownership were
people who fancied that Australian sinking
funds were honest and genuine ; that the lia-
bilities would really be paid off; and that
real national proprietorship was coming.
That vision having been dissipated amid
robbery, jobbery and corruption, hpnest be-
lievers have lost the reason for their belief.
State socialism in Australia has become the
principal refuge of scoundrels, including job-
hunters, vote-hunters, bribe-takers and other
thieves —temporarily it is hoped, but perma-
nently it appears.. Under private ownership
it is almost impossible that the community
would have to provide such big dividends on
the capital value of the lines as it does now,
the rates charged for the renewal of railway
loans having risen to a grievous height. This
is natural when no provision is made for the
repayment of loans, and they have to be re-
newed at the lender’s price. Hopelessly non-
paying private lines would simply have to
write off lost capital as other insolvents do,
whereas the State, not haying the courage to
pay off lost capital and not being able to
repudiate without blighting its credit, pays
interest on the loss indefinitely. (As a rule
it is not the builders of a line who lose by
insolvency, so much as the persons to whom
they peddled their holdings; but that is a
side issue.) Private Enterprise of the ordi-
nary, avowed railway-owning sort is, of
course, as anxious for big profits as any other
variety, but it has to be content with as much
as it can get out of the lines without destroy-
ing trade. Private Enterprise of the cumu-
lative preference sort, which owns the Aus-
tralian “State-owned” systems, takes what it
can get out of the lines and a good deal out
of the taxpayer also.
In days when the south-west of Westralia
was about as empty as the north-west is
now, that State got its early railways ouilt
bv speculative characters for a grant of
12,000 acres per mile. In Queensland,
Thomas Mcllwbaith arranged with a syn-
dicate to build a railway through the west-
ern country to the Gulf for rather less than
12,000 acres per mile—much the same line as
Premier Tiieodoke is trying to persuade the
Commonwealth to build for no land at all
per mile. Sam Geiefith and a panic among
the squatters wrecked the project. S. Aus-
tralia, making its bargain with the Common-
wealth, instead of with Private Enterprise,
which could be dealt with by law if it proved
dishonest, gave 200,000 acres per mile for
its transcontinental, and didn’t get it, and
seems unlikely to get it. This, of course, has
nothing to do with the merits or demerits of
any kind of railway. It merely proves that
certain men at Adelaide didn’t properly sum
up the possible dishonesty of certain Federal
politicians. These and other instances draw
attention to the fact that the land-grant pri-
vate speculator naturally builds in lone and
undeveloped places which require to be
opened up. for it is only there that the Gov-
ernment has big areas to give away along-
side the track. On the other hand the kind
of politician who is abundant to-day prefers
to build loan lines in localities where there
are people and votes and probably railways
already, ready-made votes being of vastly
more importance to him than pioneering
work. The land-grant shark naturally aims
at the shortest route through the most fertile
land, because his profit depends on having
desirable land to sell or lease to desirable
settlers, and he wouldn’t willingly make a
long deviation through the low-lying wastes
of south-western Queensland to oblige the
wickedest Premier that ever reigned in Bris-
bane or elsewhere. And the Private Enter-
prise man, with a single eye to profit, seeks
to join on to any or every deepwater inlet
that may be made into a prosperous seaport.
The idea of stopping work at a dead tree 60
miles from Twofold Bay, or 30 miles from
Jervis Bay. or the proposal to skirt such
places as Bowen and Port Stephens, lest
some rival interest should be “peeved,” is
not in his programme. He wouldn’t even
locate his business headquarters in Sydney
or Melbourne provided Heavitree Gap or
Daly Waters would do. Because his methods
are, of necessity, so unlike those of the worst
new-type political loan-railway jobber, the
land-grant shark seems the one hope that
Empty Australia has left.
LIGHTNING LEGISLATION.
When a Legislature sows a profusion of bills
in the last weeks of a rushed session, the
lawyer reaps briefs and the' taxpayer trouble.
Such, no doubt, will be the fruits of the
Commonwealth Parliament’s recent attempt
to do the maximum of work in the minimum
of time, that the Prime Minister and his
numerous retainers might leave for London
early in September. There is no safer bet
imaginable in this season of crocks and Cups.
The Bruce-Page Government was formed,
as a result of prolonged conversations, on
February 9. It occupied four months in
preparing its sessional programme, and fixed
a time-limit of 10 weeks for the discussion
and passage thereof. A fortnight was fooled
away in the discussion of no-confidence
motions and the like. The House of Repre-
sentatives did not seriously address itself
to business till June 28, and on August 24
it rested from its labors. In those eight
weeks 28 bills were whisked through, as well
as the Budget. This would have been quick
work had the whole eight weeks been devoted
to legislation and consideration of the esti-
mates; but the Budget and most of the 28
measures were disposed of in half that period.
Some of the most important legislative pro-
posals did not make their appearance until
the last week or so. The Advances to
Settlers Bill, for instance, arrived on August
13, the War Service Homes Bill on the
14th, the Sulphur Bounty Bill on the 15th,
the Old Age Pensions Bill not until the 24th.
These and other belated measures —Tariff
Board, Grant to Tasmania, Shale Oil Bounty,
Post and Telegraph Rates —provided for a
huge annual expenditure or sacrifice of public
money. Some of the grants were probably
justified, but it cannot be pretended that
proper consideration was given to any one
of them, much less to the general effect on
the finances. The concessions were made
ignorantly at the behest of a Government
which had no reasonable excuse for being in
a hurry.
But there are limits to the generosity of
Australian politicians, even when they are
dealing, in the last days of a lightning ses-
sion, with the public’s purse. Parliament
made no bones about voting £48,000 p.a. to
the shale-oil people, or £85,000 p.a. to the
Tasmanians, or £lOO,OOO p.a. to the manu-
facturers of sulphuric acid in lieu of their
protective duty. It approved of £200,000
being presented to soldiers whose war-service
homes cost more than the stipulated £BOO,OOO,
and of £250,000 being advanced to settlers
in the shape of wire-netting (it is to be pro-
vided at cost and free of interest), and its
only objection to the proposal that 2s. 6d.
a week (£1,500,000 p.a. altogether) should
be added to the old age and invalid pensions
was that it erred on the side of parsimony.
An unavailing attempt was made to double
the amount. But the House of Representa-
tives rebelled when urged by the Government
to remit £1,300,000 owing by certain pas-
toralists in respect of the tax on their in-
terests in Crown leaseholds. It was willing
to repeal the tax, and did so in the end. but
jibbed at extending a signal favor to “Kid-
man, Jowett and others,” as one of the
objectors expressed it. Not, it would seem,
because of the principle of the thing
or the late hour at which the pro-
posal was brought down, but because “Kid-
man, Jowett and others” are unpopular
persons, whose votes are not worth worrying
about. It is not the custom to be philan-
thropic in these matters unless the votes
are worth it. So, amidst shouts of triumph
from the Labor quarter, and a boisterous cal-
culation (wildly inexact) that “we have
saved the country our salaries for 50 years
at least,” the retroactive clause was dropped
from the bill, as sent up to the Senate.
That House is thought to have established
a new record for passing legislation against
time.
* # # *
This Land Tax Assessment Bill was the most
contentious measure introduced during the
session, and perhaps the most interesting
and significant. Its object, as described by
Earle Page, was to “cut the most ridiculous
legislative tangle Parliament has ever cre-
ated, since it cannot be unravelled.” Which
highly controversial statement he explained
in this way
The tax was imposed in 1914. For a time holders
were allowed to assess the value of their own lease-
holds. But the Commonwealth Taxation Depart-
ment began to assess values, and, unfortunately,
instead of adopting a system suitable to the vast
leasehold areas of Queensland, Westralia and South
Australia, they were forced—by a brief amendment
of the Act, which was the only direction it had —
to apply to stupendous areas of precariously occupied
country, provisions and tables of calculation devised
to meet the case of private city leases, and Crown
leases with the right of purchase, in inner-settle-
ment districts. The results achieved showed such
discrepancies with the owners’ valuations, and raised
such a storm of protest, that the collection of the
tax was suspended in March, 1918, and it has not
been collected since.
The Treasurer’s main argument for remission
was that the tax was assessed on values
which, owing chiefly to the slump in cattle,
had vanished, if they ever existed. He quoted
the experience of a Warrego (Q.) man who
was assessed at £225 p.a. in respect of a
lease which he offered to sell for £2OO, stock
and plant thrown in, and. not getting it,
abandoned. “Cases like that,” the Min-
ister said, “could be quoted ad nauseam.
The fact is that the £1,300,000 repre-
sented as arrears of taxation is largely an
illusory sum.” But even so, that does
not justify the course which the Government
saw fit to take. Beyond question the tax
was monstrously unjust and oppressive in
the instances quoted by the Treasurer, and
there may even be a case for “Kidman,
Jowett and others,” but the case required
to be proved, and proved it was not. A few
days before the end of a chaotic session was
no time to bring down a bill of this descrip-
tion, involving a sacrifice of £1,300,000 law-
fully due and owing. But it is the shiftless
fashion of Australian politicians to commit
follies in ignorance and try to repair them in
a flurry.
THE POLYCRATES CASE AND THE
A.J.C.
The A.J.C., like its model, the English Turf
Club, is a government within a government.
Not a constitutional government, but a des-
potism as unqualified, within certain wide
limits, as that of Moscow. This is neces-
sary, for its fsphqres of influence are so many
gambling hells; and every gambling hell,
unless it is to develop into a place of ille-
gality and violence, requires to be controlled
with a sudden and ruthless hand. The
A.J.C. differs from the rest of our imperii
in imperio— the Bar Council, the
the Law Institute, etc.—inasmuch as its
functions are continually being exercised.
That is only another way of saying that its
subjects are continually in revolt against the
iron discipline it is obliged to impose in
order to retain a measure of popular re-
spect for racing. Unless the public can be
satisfied that a legalised gaming establish-
ment—whether it be a Monte Carlo casino
or a Randwick racecourse—is conducted
with rigid honesty and impartiality, so far,
anyhow, as those at the head of affairs are
concerned, its days are numbered. Take
some of the laws governing the behavior of
jockeys. A jockey who speaks to, or in any
way communicates with, a stranger after
weighing out for a race is heavily fined. If
he accepts a present from a bettor or bets
himself he may have his license suspended
or even cancelled permanently. Tod Sloan,
the greatest horseman America ever sent
to the United Kingdom, was disqualified by
the Jockey Club for betting. He had not
laid against his mounts —no one ever
accused Sloan of pulling a horse: his
offence was that he had backed himself.
For this he was deprived for life of the
right to pursue his profession anywhere in
the world—an English disqualification carry-
ing in America and Europe, as an Austra-
lian one does. That such drastic methods
are necessary, if the racing business is to
be kept reasonably clean, must be evident
to anyone who considers the certain results
of jockeys (say) being allowed to take money
for their efforts from outsiders. Admit the
principle that a jockey may back himself,
and there is no logical reason why lie should
not back someone else: allow him to take
outside money for winning in one case, and
he will be likely to take it for losing in
another.
* * * *
These remarks are inspired by the recent
Sydney court case in which the members of
a syndicate swore that they “arranged to
share a third °f the prize-money with tile
owner of a horse (Polycrates) which they
had drawn in Tatt.’s, if it ran first, second
or third; that it ran second, and that they
paid the owner, Mr, Macarthue Onslow,
£600.” At the time of writing the A.J.C.
committee has made no move in this matter
(the first public exposure, by the way, of a
practice which lias been whispered about
ever since Tattersall’s started operating on
a big scale) ; and yet it is one that fairly
shouts for attention. Confusion, contradic-
tion and anonymity hang over the situation
like a pall. In letters to the press F. M »o
arthur Onslow refers to Polycrates as ‘ one
of my horses,” while in the “Turf Register” it
figures as the property of J. W. and F. A.
Macarthur Onslow. Members e' the syndi-
cate told the Court that they arranged to
pay a third of their winnings tc Macarthur
Onslow if Polycrates was placed, and that
they did so. Macarthur Onslow has told
the press that he arranged for his “trainer
and staff” to be paid the money, and that
they got it. Macarthur Onslow appa-
rently imagines that by transferring the
acceptance of this enormous secret commis-
sion to an unnamed trainer and the latter’s
stable-lads he has regularised the position
and soothed the public mind. In point of
fact, it is immaterial to patrons of racing
whether an owner, a trainer or a jockey
agreed to receive the cash. Enough for
them that anybody connected with a reput-
able stable should take such a rotten state
of affairs for granted. If it is allowable
for a stable to arrange to take a third of
the sweep-money in a classic event for a win,
what is to prevent it declining to try, or
deciding to scratch the horse concerned, on
the ground that only a fourth was offered?
Tatt.’s ticket-holders are not the only people
who stand to win or lose thousands of
pounds sterling on the goodwill of a racing-
owner and his employees. Every big course
in Australia has its professional and quasi-
professional punters, to whom a fair run
in any given event may mean, not the paltry
£llOO which the syndicate under discussion
split up, but 10 or 20 times as much. Is
it right that one who has backed himself,
at none too generous odds maybe, to win
£IO,OOO should be required to insure against
an unspecified though easily imagined catas-
trophe, to the tune of £3OOO-odd? And
what of the public, assuming the big bettor
jibs and the “stable” decides to teach him
a lesson? And then there are the members
of the Ring—the bookmaker who backs
horses in addition to laying them; the book-
maker who overlays his book; the book-
maker who finds that the double which a
month ago looked innocuous now threatens
him with the loss of a fortune. All such
speculators, and dozens more that could
readily be mentioned, are open at times tc
make “arrangements” pro or con. as the
case may be, with owners, trainers, jockeys
or those intangible entities known as
“stables.” It may be to their advantage tc
pay through the nose for a win—or a defeat
It may suit the “stable” to accept the prof-
fered bribe; and even to promise a percent-
age of the loot to some rival stable in the
event of all going well. But it is a disastrous
system from the standpoint of the deluded
thousands who bet “on form,” and to say
that it is detrimental to the good name
and best interests of racing is to put it
mildly.
* * * *
So far as the Polycrates matter is con-
cerned three main points urgently need to
be cleared up :
Who owned the horse at the time of the transac-
tion with the Tatt.’s syndicate?
Who got the £600?
If a trainer, what is his name?
Mr. Macarthur Onslow’s offhanded and
sketchy handling of these problems in the
press is beside the question. Statements
made ex parte in the correspondence column
of the newspapers are of little value, more
particularly when they conflict in certain
vital respects with statements made on oath
in a court of law. The obvious place for
Mr. Onslow to appear with any explana-
tion he may have to offer is before the High
Court of racing—the committee of the
A.J.C. He.has a right to be heard there:
and it is emphatically the duty of the


A.J.C. not merely to recognise his right
but to insist on its being exercised.
The A.J.C. very properly makes no dis-
tinction between jockeys who have
backed themselves and those who have backed
others; who have been paid by interested
strangers to win or to lose. A jockey who
admitted that he had been paid £6OO in re-
spect of a race'worth £IBOO might conceiv-
ably escape by explaining that he had passed
the cash on to one of the racecourse farriers,
but the transaction would certainly demand
exhaustive inquiry—as the Polycrates trans-
action does. The A.J.C. committee, which
can do anything of an autocratic nature,
from disciplining a jockey for insolence or
for wearing uncleaned boots to summon-
ing bookmakers before it for employing
“runners,” as it did last week, is
competent to call on Mr. Macartiiur
Onslow to name the trainer who
allegedly got the syndicate’s £600; it can
call on the trainer and his lads for their
story, and it can demand the bank-books
and income-tax returns of all the parties
implicated. Its unique strength as an in-
vestigator is a matter of its authority to
give recalcitrants the option between assist-
ing it to the full or getting off the turf.
The Speaker of the N. S. Wales Assembly
has just had a boy of 19 sent for trial on
the alleged ground that the latter, who badly
wanted a job, offered him (the Speaker) a
bribe for it. Is it any less flagitious for a
racing stable to be offered, and to accept,
a bribe not to lose a race?
EASIER SPELLING.
Under the presidency of Professor Gilbert
Murray, the Simplified Spelling Society is
making an appeal to the British Prime Min-
ister to “appoint a commission, which should
include scholars, teachers, men of letters and
men of business to consider the whole matter
and report whether reform be practicable.”
The claim of the advocates of reform is that
an enormous amount of effort is expended in
teaching children to spell in an arbitrary
way, and that for all this there is no com-
pensating gain. They declare that “no
philologist or student of language of any
eminence is opposed to the removal of these
anomalies, and many are strongly in favor
of reform.” In support of this they quote
Sir James A. H. Murray as saying: “The
ordinary appeals to etymology against spell-
ing reform utterly break down upon examina-
tion.”
Anybody who will follow the course of a
few word-changes and derivations in, say,
the Oxford Dictionary will be ready to agree
to much the reformers put forward. Phonetic
spelling will then be seen as by no means a
• new thing ; and the student will be surprised
at some of the extraordinary shapes, that
words have assumed. To make a fetish of
an arbitrary spelling and declare that it is
fundamental in the language is absurd. In
the spacious days of great Elizabeth, and
earlier, writers were in the habit of spelling
words very much as the fancy moved them.
No doubt they worked on some sort of sys-
tem and with occasional regard to the deri-
vation of the word ; but the latitude allowed
was very great —in fact, as late as the 18th
century Pope could still declare that spelling
was a matter for the printer. It is to no-
thing sacred in the basis of the language, but
to the sacred ignorance of the printer, that
we owe many of the most painful masses of
redundant letters in common words. The
17th-century printers adopted curious codes
of their own; the 18th century firmly estab-
lished the usage of these; the 19th century
practically made them a codicil to the Prayer
Book, and insisted that a knowledge of the
printer’s mistakes of 200 years earlier was
the only true foundation of an English edu-
cation. The spelling of our words is no more
sacred than the political Constitution. Both
can be altered by the will of the people with-
out violating any fundamental law.
But this does not settle the question, nor
indeed touch the fringe of it. In spite of
the disguises under Avhich they now appear,
most of our words still show something of
their ancestry on their faces. To know a
word well, to appreciate its race and quali-
ties, to be familiar with its kin and its his-
tory is as important for knowing how to use
it as the knowledge of the antecedents of
the men who compose his army is to a general
leading them. One word is fiery and eager,
another slow, heavy and enduring; and their
spelling is often like a family coat-of-arms,
telling at a glance the place of either in the
peerage of speech. The sound of the word
• is even modified to the mental ear by the
redundant letters which cannot be pro-
nounced. Even the things the 17th-century
printer added without authority to the coat-
.of-arms have only . given . an added distinc-
tion of imaginary sound. Users of English
would have to decide whether the loss en-
tailed by a change to a,phonetic system would
be compensated for by the relief to children
learning and teachers teaching the language..
If there is any doubt about the matter the
spelling should be left alone.
More important, however, is the question
of phonetics itself To what pronunciation
are we going to adjust the spelling of our
words? From the earliest times up to the
Tudor period people used the ear as a guide
to spelling. That is, the spelling in each in-
dividual book written was, in the main, a
phonetic attempt to render the pronunciation
of the word as used at that date. But the
trouble was that the pronunciation changed
so rapidly in an age when few men could
read that no system of phonetic spelling
could last more than a few years. It- was
the art of printing and even the arbitrary
spelling of the printer that did so much to
fix the pronunciation and hold it in its place.
Long acceptance of the general rule that we
should speak our words in the same way that
our fathers did has made us a little blind
to the fact that we are constantly reminded
to do so by seeing the words in their familiar
shape in print. So the real danger of adopting
phonetic spelling lies in its lack of finality.
What is phonetic in 1923 may cease to be
so in 1958; and if the reform is to go on
continuously, as long as pronunciation
changes every century will present us with
another dead Mhguage as far from our own
as that of Chaucer is from the speech of
to-day. The student who, to read 10 dif-
ferent English authors, had to learn 10 dif-
ferent languages might be much worse off
than the child who has to learn to spell
under the present difficulties. Even to-day
it is clear that an accurate phonetic spelling
for Chicago would not be an accurate pho-
netic spelling for London; and if there is
to be any uniformity in the English-speaking
world it would be a very grave matter to
decide ivhich pronunciation should be fol-
lowed. There is the further difficulty of
fixing the method of phonetics. Thus, it is
suggested in the leaflet issued by the advo-
cates of reform that “dul” should spell
“dull.” But why? With a single l follow-
ing it, the vowel should have its full u
sound. To get a system that is worth while
we should need a new and greatly-extended
alphabet with about a dozen additional
vowels. The most we can do without them
is a tinker’s job.
It might be urged in favor of even this
reform that it would save a lot of paper,
quite considerably reducing the size of books;
and this may become an important point
in the near future, and be worth a little
thought. Daily newspapers and advertising
sheets are rapidly eating up the world’s
means of literature; and it may be that at
our present speed, unless we attend to the
really more urgent matter of replacing our
forests, the lapse of a century or two will
find us with no need for spelling, phonetic
or arbitrary. Then, in an age of flowing
speech and stronger eyes, the few ancient
volumes that have not been utterly thumbed
away may remain as curiosities of ancient
custom, rather than as necessities of the
race, while the ledgers are kept Inca-fashion
with knotted strings, and even the wildest
republic refrains from issuing a paper cur-
rency.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Our Ambassador to England.
Serious doubts begin to arise as to whether
Australia is sending to England Bruce, the
Protectionist Prime Minister, and suite, or
Bruce, the Freetrade importer, and retinue.
It is inevitable that commercial matters will
crop up at the Conference and elsewhere,
and some of the Prime Minister’s remarks
about foreign markets and commercial trea-
ties and other well-worn topics suggest that
he is going with no very definite policy save
the one which a softgoods gentleman might
learn in Flinders-lane, or while studying for
the Bar in England. For instance, this was
a bit of Bruce holding forth to the Empire
Development Union in Melbourne: —
Australia wanted population, but it was not going
to take, immigrants unless there were assured mar-
kets .... Income-tax and other taxation concessions
might be.allowed on capital employed in truly de-
velopmental works, thus promoting settlement within
the Empire.
The first sentence is the reliable old mer-
cantile talk which has not been so much
heard in Federal circles since Softgoods
McMillan went out of politics. Smith,
the immigrant, is to come here and produce
things like wheat and butter and cheese and
fruit and meat, of which we have a great
surplus that is hard to get rid of already,
with a view to the export of raw material
only. The position is admitted to be impos-
sible unless foreign markets are first assured
for Smith’s extra output. There is, how-
ever, another side to the case, though it
doesn’t appeal to mercantile gentlemen like
McMillan and Bruce :
Smith, the immigrant, is an assured market him-
self if he'is the right kind of Smith, and provided
a few simple arrangements are made for his reception
by raising the tariff and otherwise. He is just what
Bruce and his kind are crying out for. Seeing that
the population of the world has to be its own market,
and can’t sell its surplus raw or finished materials
among the stars, Smith, as part and sample of that
population, should be likewise.
If this country imports as a steady practice four
Smiths who can make things which we require for
every one Smith, or half.-SMiTH, who proposes to
raise things to be peddled in precarious foreign
markets, Australia will gain a lot of taxpaying
population and a lot of new markets, and save a lot
of freight both ways, and no one will lose barring
shipowners and importing firms.
Then it won’t be necessary to bribe, with tax-
exemptions which we can ill-afford, “truly develop-
mental” people to come here and gather dividends to
be spent abroad.
So Bruce will apparently start his career
in England with the good old Freetrade
assumption that- our only hope of population
lies in finding more foreign buyers for the
wheat and bull-beef and other drugs-in-the-
market. And he will discover lots of people
who are willing to give these articles a
preference over someone else’s wheat and
bull-beef, just as we might prefer one man’s
dried shark to another, provided Australia
gives a preference to their manufactured
wares in exchange. In fact, the Prime Min-
ister recently declared that such was the
hunger for commercial treaties of this sort
that Australia had received overtures from
“practically every country of any standing
in the world,” just as a supposed heiress of
weak intellect might receive offers from all
the leading fortune-hunters of the neighbor-
hood. Of course, nothing we could get in
return for tariff concessions would prevent
the distances being long and costly, and the
markets being often overstocked, and the
prices wretchedly low, nor could anything
prevent the raw-produce community being
almost invariably a poor community, and the
agricultural Hodge an impecunious Hodge.
Australia shouldn’t want to buy new foreign
markets, if such things exist, with reduced
duties on anybody’s goods. Its ambition
should be to do with the foreign markets it
has, or with fewer foreign markets than it
has, and to increase the duties on almost
everybody’s goods; and it is a perfectly, feas-
ible ambition. In other words, the aim of
every patriot should be to reduce external
trade in proportion to population, and the
freight bill thereof, to a minimum. That,
and not any complicated boggling with com-
mercial treaties, is the way to get people
and wealth. It is the way the United States
took; and no country in modern or any other
times has acquired so much of either.
Some Factory Facts.
As usual, the latest N. S. Wales factory
figures are instructive. At June 30, 1922,
the Ma State possessed 3865 more factory
employees than it had a year earlier. That
is to say, the metropolis had 6037 more,
and the rest of the State had 2172 less.
The share of the metropolis (207 sq. miles)
was 3972 factories and 110,589 workers,
while that of the rest of the State (309,225
sq. miles) was 2384 factories with 38,28<
employees. The metropolis had gathered in
44 per cent, of the population, which was
bad enough, and 77 per cent, of the best-
paid industries, which was worse. Twenty-
one years earlier the rest of the State had
537 more factories than the spider capital,
instead of 1588 less as in 1921, though as
the country industries were paltry affairs,
about 38 per cent, not even employing
machinery, the city had the advantage even
then in the number of hands engaged, which
is the most important matter. But between
1901 and 1922 remarkable things took place,
these being some of them:—
Increase in number of Sydney factories 2,55/
Increase in all other factories . . . . 432
Increase in number of Sydney employees 68,174
Increase in all other employees .. •• 14,472
The number of N. S. Wales country fac-
tories began to decrease as far back as 1913,
and between then and 1922 the decline was
211, with a more than proportionate de-
cline in the number of employees. And
these results were achieved despite the fact
that Lithgow and Newcastle and many other
country centres have coal at their doors, while
Sydney must bring both coal and iron from
some distance. Though in the circumstances
Centralisation wasn’t easy, by persistence in
ill-doing it was managed. In the 21 years
in question about 2400 miles of railway
were built to bring trade to Port Jackson,
the position being that it must go there or
nowhere; and no railway at all was built
to let the commerce of the interior have an
outlet at any other port, however convenient
and economical the other port might be. Mean-
time the bellowings of politicians about
“decentralisation” and “the necessity to fill
up the empty spaces” have reached a degree
of intensity never equalled since Satan
joined the Church and Sim. Degree gave all
his money to the Anti-Slavery Society. The
matter even crops up in the proposal that
the losses on the network of unpayable rail-
ways which concentrate trade on Sydney
shall be charged to taxation, so that, with
this subsidy, it may be possible to go on giving
unpayable freights over absurdly long dis-?
tances to the one city, instead of charging
ordinary payable rates over the shortest dis-
tances to the nearest port. The very re-
markable Premier Fuller (describes even
this as quite a daring and violent move ,in
the way of decentralisation.
•
High Finance. :,/
Queensland has passed a measure author-
ising the Government to borrow over
£25,000,000 to meet loans falling due within
the next 22 months. And no doubt the
money will be got, because :f the creditor
refused to renew he would precipitate a
crisis which would involve not only this
amount but the whole £56,000,000 which
Queensland owes abroad, and probably the
local debt as well. It is better, he argues,
to get any sort of an lOTJ and keep the
debtor pretending to be alive, than to get
nothing and be certain that he is dead. The
hand that will be held out to Queensland
—and, indeed, to any Australian borrower —
will, then, lack some of the old cordiality,
for these very good reasons: —
(1) John Bull is not the capitalist, or the man
with unlimited foreign investments to draw upon,
that he was. He is paying taxes which seem almost
incredible in order to reduce his own foreign debt
of about £1,000,000,000. In addition he lent
£2,000,000,000 to distressed allies, and fears that
most of it is gone for good.
(2) He can’t avoid having lost a good deal of
faith in the irresponsible Federal child who wouldn’t
tax himself to any serious extent to help on the
war, but chalked up everything to loans, and de-
faulted on the promise to pay the Old Man in
London a moderate sum in cash for the upkeep of
his gallant troops.
(3) Further, it is difficult for J. Bull to avoid
noticing that his State children seem to pay the
interest by steadily borrowing ‘more and more
principal; that even then taxes increase (towards
the breaking point in some cases) ; that repayment,
or even cessation of loan-raising, is never mentioned ;
and that many of the “permanent and reproduc-
tive works” which are supposed to guarantee the
lOU would .be better (in a purely cash sense) if
burnt or drowned, inasmuch as they return nothing
or less.
So Queensland, with the biggest gold debt
save one, the very smallest sinking fund,
the worst crowd of assets, and the silliest
habit of talking repudiation, is likely to be
welcomed in London merely as an unavoid-
able nuisance. Theodore discourses vam-
gloriously about the alternative of applying
to the New York market —this because he
once got a small sum there, on such stiff
terms as regards sinking fund that Uncle
Sam was made a species of preferred credi-
tor. But if applied to for a really large
amount by a rather dubious debtor in a
really indubitable hole, it is quite on the
cards that Uncle would ask for tangible
security, possibly State railways or State
lands, the same to be held and managed by
resident Yankee commissioners for the coun-
try’s good and their own. Even J. Bull
may impose such terms one of these days.
It is the fate which regularly comes to weak
and spendthrift nations. Judging by his
record among the smaller Latin American
States, and still more by his recent burst of
financial activity in Asiatic Turkey, Uncle,
having pretty nearly finished the develop-
ment of his own country, has got the craze
for foreign “spheres of influence” badly,
and Queensland, not to mention Australia,
wouldn’t make a bad commercial “sphere.”
It is certainly one of the possibilities that
must be taken into account by any State or
other Government which contemplates going
heavily into debt to Samuel, especially if it
makes no better fist than Australia is doing
at putting its financial house in order.
Sea Defence and Red Herrings.
A popular method of controversy has been
employed to defeat Australian defence (and
particularly sea-defence) ever since Federa
tion. The publication last week of the
balance-sheet of the Dreadnought Fund was
a reminder of Conservatism’s final heroic
effort to sidetrack the R.A.N. The same
spirit prevails, and the same devices are
being used, as of old ; the only difference is
that the Singapore base is now the object oi
the anti-defenceites’ chief hostility. The tac-
tical scheme is to suggest an alternative plan
—preferably one so idiotic that there is no
danger of its ever being adopted—and to
divert argument to that. A subscription
Dreadnought (one lonely vessel without offi-
cers or.men) was talked of as an alternative
to a local navy 13 years ago: to-day the
cry is for a base (li.N.) at Port Stephens,
or, still better, at Sydney. Singapore is
the choice of the British Admiralty and
House of Commons, whose experts may he
presumed to know what they are 'doing. No
doubt it has been chosen primarily to defend
the Empire’s “Eastern” trade. But immense
volumes of Australia’s imports arrive by
the Gulf of Aden-Colombo route, and the
exports and gold sent in payment travel the
same tracks. It is as necessary in war-time
for a country situated as Australia is to
keep its lines of communication open as it
was during the war for a front-line battery
to be in touch with ammunition-dumps. Aus-
tralia’s vital sea communications are not
going t<3 be menaced in the immediate vicinity
of Melbourne or Sydney Heads. The Com-
monwealth would be most unlikely to bring
such things as guns and munitions to the
eastern States by water. The blockade-point
will be in the Indian Ocean —in other words,
in the sphere covered most effectively by Singa-
pore. It is interesting, not to say significant,
in this connection, that Japan should have
included in its new naval programme a
couple of dozen 1500-ton cruisers suited for
nothing else but commerce-raiding. Such
vessels might cut the throat of our sea-
borne commerce from Hong Kong to the Keel-
ings without a British fleet based on Singa-
pore, irrespective of whether or no there was
a base at a N. S. Wales port nearly three
weeks’ steam from the scene of danger. And,
in any event, as those who are clamoring
for an R.N. .base on the N. S. Wales coast
well know, the thing is outside the scheme
of practical politics—as far outside as the
notion that Australians will ever be per-
suaded to put up oi millions sterling, their
fair share of the Imperial defence bill, in the
form of an annual cash subsidy. A modern
base capable of accommodating a cruiser of
the Hawkins type is estimated to cost
£12,000,000 if built largely by coolie labor:
in Australia the bill might well work out at
three times as much. Since the taxpayers
of Britain will have to find most of the
money wherever the base is, they can then
be relied on not to favor N."S. Wales. Nor
do many of those who are blithering about
the desirability of a base at Port Stephens
really want one there: their object is to
prevent an Australian fleet unit being asso-
ciated with an Imperial base anywhere.
The Flood of Foreign “Pitchers.”
W. Scott Fell, one of the members for
North Shore, spoke to the N. S. Wales
Assembly recently on the vicious foreign
monopoly of the Australian film-market. His
speech was ignored by the newspapers which
thrive on moving-picture advertisements, or
hope to thrive on them, but it was pertinent
enough. Witness the subjoined extracts: —
From inquiries I find that 98 per cent, of the
moving pictures shown in Australia are foreign
controlled and -owned. During two years 1500 pic-
tures were imported into this country, 1475 of
them being American- or German-owned. German
stuff is coming in by way of America ; Germany has
a law that for every film imported into German}',
one from Germany must be taken in return. Aus-
tralian showmen cannot exhibit films of Australian oi
British origin because, under their arrangement with
suppliers, they have got to pay for programmes oi
foreign pictures, whether they use them or not. A
picture called “The Queen of Sheba” was entered
for duty at £BO. According to the Evening News
it has been shown in Sydney to 270,000 people, and
hired to suburban picture shows at £4OO a week.
If it has Paid duty only on £BO value (roughly
about. £43) and has had the financial results which
I have stated, I want to know where the huge profits
go. We are in the grip of a great foreign monopoly,
which is taking £4,000,000 out of the counftrj
yearly. That sum is actually remitted to America,
These and other statements are on record in
Hansard, and the foreign moving-picture
interest has had plenty of time to disprove
them if they are false. But no disproof has
been forthcoming. There hasn’t even been
a letter to the papers from the boisterous
American gentleman who proudly declared
in June that his “organisation,” the Para-
mount, had been the means of introducing
into Australia “11 pictures produced in Bri
tain, ‘a number’ produced on the Continent”
—total and country unspecified—“and one
Australian production.” The gentleman
went on to protest that his locally-registered
company should be “inviolate,” being “per-
meated with the real Australian spirit,” but
when it was pointed out that 9708 of its
10,000 shares were held by a New York
corporation he sought refuge in silence. The
head of this Paramount “organisation,” by
the way, is Adolph Zukor, an emigrant to
America from Hungary, where his people
were German. The same senseless conces-
sion is given to Chaplin, Fairbanks,
Mary Pickeord and other foreign “film-
stars” organised in companies, to the injury
of Australian entertainers who necessarily
spend a great part of their earnings in the
Commonwealth. It is of a piece with the
enormous folly of letting American and Ger-
man stuff come in, to the extent of 16 or
17 million feet a year, at the fatuous rate
of lid. a foot —this in a country with a
perfect climate for picture-production, a
great local market (and an unsatisfied de-
mand abroad) for clean films and home-grown
actors and scenario-writers with established
reputations. Apropos, Father O’Sulli-
van, of the Tie. Council of Education, sug-
gested recently that “the Australian film
industry should be encouraged, and the
importation of films discouraged, in the
special interests of Australian children,
This could be done, along with other things,
by limiting imports to, say, 7,000,000 feet
p.a., and raising the present farcical duty
to a point at which it would stimulate the

The Perils of the Mine.
Human ingenuity has enormously reduced
the danger of working in coal; but it has not
yet wholly overcome the liability to disaster,
and so Maitland (N.S.W.) is mourning the
death of .21 men. What happened nobody
knows—only that there was a sudden out-
break of , fire in the Hetton Co.’s Bellbird
colliery, followed by an explosion, and that
the carbon gas which rolled through the
workings forbade anything in the nature of
successful relief work, although, as always
in such cases, there were men who were pre-
pared to risk everything in the forlorn hope
of saving life. More might have been done
had respirators been available; but they
were not. Apart from the fact that the dis-
aster happened at a time when but few men
were employed in the mine—though possibly
with the working places filled the origin of
the trouble would have been sooner dis-
covered —the only small consolation that can
be drawn is that, thanks to the enlightened
legislation which arrived with the Miners
Accident Relief Fund, now merged into a
larger measure of workmen’s compensation,
the dependants of the victims of such disas-
ters are no longer thrown wholly upon then-
own generally most slender resources. The
benefits are still insufficient; and the pre-
sent disaster will, it is hoped, turn public
attention to the necessity for going further
along the lines of industrial insurance. In-
deed, it is doubtful whether the old Miners’
Accident Fund should have been interfered
with. The community which only sees that
the men who take the miners’ risks are well
paid for it does not do its whole duty : there
is also the obligation upon it to see that the
industry provides for the widow and the
dependant, as well as for those whom their
occupation has rendered unfit by reason of
accident or otherwise. And it has not yet
done so in anything like full measure. It
is not in cases where many men are killed
at one blow that the most acute distress is
felt; public attention is then seized, and
special relief is furnished. It is. in . the
unsensational case, when a man is killed
by a commonplace mishap that gets only a
three-line paragraph, that the widotv and
fatherless are most pinched. The Bulle-
tin has no word to say against the special
l ’" r >ds; but the miner’s dependant ought not
to be in any degree whatever dependent upon
them. The industry should carry its own
burdens.
The Kidman Blight.
This controversy was really wound up last
week; but the man who started it, Leslie
Wrigley, is entitled to a belated reply, and
a reply from back of Thargomindah couldn t
very well help being belated :
As The Bulletin had printed numerous letters
on. the “Kidman Blight” and Mr. Norman Ford s
refcily to my original article on the subject (B.
28/6/’23), I considered any further comment on my
part superfluous. There are just two points, however,
in Mr. Ford’s defence of Mr. Kidman’s methods which
call for some remark on my part. In the first place,
Mr. Ford states that my name does not ' appear
amongst those who pay rent for Crown lands in the
Warrego district. I suggest that Mr. Ford have an-
other look at this valuable book of reference of his.
He may then find that I acquired Bellera holding
(40 sq. miles), situated 75 miles west of Thargo-
mindah, in December of last year, and with my
partner have been in occupation since that date.
Mr. Ford goes very wide of the mark when he
suggests that I may be a “possible aspirant for poli-
tical honors.” I know little or nothing of poli-
tics, and am at present far too busy endeavbring to
improve this selection, by fencing it and putting
down wells. Doubtless, Mr. Ford would consider
this a form of madness, peculiar to returned soldiers
and other imbeciles. Nevertheless, we prefer, strange
as it may seem, to keep Kidman’s cattle oh the
other side of our boundary. Secondly, Mr. Ford
points out that the area of Bulloo Downs is 640
sq. miles, and refers me to the Queensland Govern-
ment Gazette. Not having any books of reference
in the camp, I will take Mr. Ford’s word for it.
But it is very evident that he has not been in this
part of the State, or he would know that Bulloo
Downs is unfenced, and as the adjoining holdings,
Puteroo, ’’Becker, Koolyadhu, to mention only a few,
are in a like state, and are either held by Kidman
himself, his partners or employees, they are gener-
ally regarded as the one station (Bulloo Downs). If
Mr. Ford will ascertain the areas of the unfenced
holdings adjoining Bulloo Downs and leased to Kid-
man, he will find that I have not over-estimated
the area when I gave it as 5000 sq. miles.
Consumption and Its Cure.
From a city consulting-room
Dr. W. Camac Wilkinson, formerly Hon. Physician
to Sydney Hospital and Lecturer in Pathology at
Sydney Medical School in the old days >vhen students
were few (his first class, in 1887,. consisted of six
students), has returned after a long absence in Lon-
don, where he practised as a specialist at No. 8
Upper Wimpole-street and conducted a dispensary
at Brixton for the treatment of T.B. sufferers. There
his own methods, which he had settled before he left
Sydney, were carried out, and from his recent writ-
ings I judge that he has not changed or even modi-
fied his treatment. Since he left Australia tubercu-
losis has acquired, unfortunately, a deplorable pre-
eminence, a legacy from the Great War. The diag-
nosis in war-time left much to be desired, and I was
not surprised when Dr. E. Rist, of Paris, at last
year’s B.M.A. meeting at Glasgow, said that of 193
men referred to him who were diagnosed as suffering
from pulmonary tuberculosis only 27.5 were genuine
cases of the disease. Fifty per cent, of the re-
mainder had bronchial catarrh due to nose and
throat trouble. Dr. Wilkinson is sceptical of the
advantages of ordinary sanatorium treatment, but
believes that biological cure can be obtained by
specific remedies. His views are in agreement with
those of Professor Liebermeister, whose article on
“Tubercle Bacilli in the Blood” (in Loewenstein’s
textbook) he reviewed in the B.M.j. of June 23 last.
THE FIRST SPRING FASHION PARADE.
Pulmonary tuberculosis is regarded by them as part
of a general disease, the tuberc'e bacilli while in
the blood being inert, and treatment should aim at
preventing their distribution to the tissues of the body.
To the true scientist self-advertisement is anathema,
so it is not to be wondered at that the methods of
Spahlinger do not appeal to Dr. Wilkinson. In
fact, he felt compelled to attack the remedy in let-
ters to a leading London daily, and he is bitterly
hostile to anything which tends to raise fallacious
hopes in the minds of sufferers. His visit to Sydney,
therefore, where there is a good deal of restlessness
amongst consumptive patients over the alleged mira-
culous powers of Spahlinger’s serum, comes oppor-
tunely. Not a week goes by without some society
or union passing resolutions begging the Common-
wealth to acquire the remedy at all costs. Most of
it is, of course, political flapdoodle, but the effect on
consumptives is bad. No doubt Dr. Wilkinson s
sane views drawn from long experience—nobody
living knows more about tuberculosis and its treat-
ment than he —will have the effect of clarifying
public opinion, and it is to be hoped that he will be
consulted by the Government before any step is taken
for the acquisition of the so-called specific.
As regards the submission of international
disputes to the League of Nations, the rules
of the game begin to be apparent. When
neither party would fight if it could help
doing so, they submit the quarrel to the
League as a dignified way of getting out.
Otherwise the big party dashes in the ultima-
tum just in the style of 1914. The other day
some Italian officers were ambushed and shot
while helping, in a neutral sort of way, to
mark out the Greek-Albanian frontier.
Albania, a region of rocks and clans and
feuds, ruled over in a sort of way by three
regents (Mohammedan, R.C. and Greek
Catholic), is about as good a proposition to
collect indemnities from as a drove of wiid
cats, and in any case Greece and Italy have
an old quarrel over the country. So it took
the Italian 2-J minutes by his telescopic
watch to see into the matter; to find that
the liers-in-wait were Greeks and that their
Government had sooled them on ; and to de-
mand an abject apology, a public funeral
in the cathedral at Athens (with the Greek
Cabinet in attendance), a salute (by way
of more apology to the Italian fleet, which
would lie off Athens for the purpose, looking
big and ferocious), £500,000 indemnity and
the execution of the offenders, who are pro-
bably as findable as last year’s fog. Some-
thing over five seconds were allowed for a
complete climb-down, and the League of
Nations was told that it didn’t appear in
this act. Adding this to Russia’s recent
ultimatum to Bulgaria, the League Without
Claws must begin to wonder if it appears
in any act.
It seems probable that no such toll of human
life has been taken by earthquake and tidal
wave in the whole history of Japan as that
of which the first news began to reach the
outside world on Monday morning. It is
even possible that the catastrophe transcends
in magnitude any natural calamity of which
record exists. Such a view may fi e j how-
ever —and it is to be hoped it is unduly
pessimistic; there is a gleam of comfort rn
the published opinion of Dr. Omobi, the dis-
tinguished Japanese scientist now in Sydney
—he was actually watching a seismograph
record the earthquake on Saturday, although
the watchers were unaware of its exact loca-
tion—that the early reports may be exag-
gerated. Nevertheless, it seems piteously
certain that hundreds of thousands have
perished. The full force of the earthquake,
it is believed, fell on a belt of 300 miles, and
that the most thickly-populated area of a
small country of 56 million people. The
sympathy of the whole world may well go
out to a country stricken by a calamity so
appalling.
A definite attempt towards the solving of
the apprenticeship problem was made the
other day by the Vic. plastering trades, when
representatives of the union and of the em-
ployers drew up and signed an agreement
which may do something to prevent plaster-
ing from becoming a lost art. finder the
agreement apprentices will be expected to
attend a technical school, partly in their own
and partly in their employers’ time, the
cost being shared with the boy by union and
employer. Employers undertake to increase
by 2s. 6d. a week the wages of all appren-
tices who are successful in passing the tech-
nical school yearly examinations; and pre-
ference is to be extended by the union, when
supplying labor, to the employer who is
training apprentices, and by the employer to
the man willing to teach a lad his trade.
Although vacancies are not likely to be
rushed while boys of a suitable age can com-
mand double the money in a dead-end occu-
pation where they learn nothing, the agree-
ment represents a definite and praiseworthy
effort on the part of the union to get away
from the common dog-in-the-manger attitude:
and there can be no doubt whatever that if
the example is followed by other trades, both
in Victoria and elsewhere,'the workers them-
selves and their families will be substantial
gainers by it.
“Womerah” : Under “The Teachers’ Trade”
“One Who Has Learned It” breaks a lance
(B. 16/8/’23) over the N. S. Wales method
of grading teachers. As a headmaster and
a teacher of 20 years’ experience, I recognise
in this correspondent one of the dear old
humbugs that are unhappily too numerous
in our service. His complaint is that “a
teacher is expected to show educational at-
tainments many years in advance of work
to be taught.” In modern mechanism there
is always a provision for safe work-
ing which greatly exceeds the actual
requirements. The greater the teacher’s
store of knowledge—which connotes the
application of knowledge—the better equip-
ment he has for his work. At its examina-
tions for the higher grades the Department
does not prescribe “information” papers.
The aspirants for promotion practically set
their own papers. They are required, to
write theses on subjects they are particu-
larly interested in, with a bias towards ori-
ginal research in school interests. It is
the most equitable examination system in
the world, and ensures that the successful
candidates are those with the greatest pro-
fessional interest and spirit. The' “incon-
gruity of paying vastly different salaries to
men performing the same class of work” is
happily an idle fancy. The higher a teacher
is classified the greater his responsibility.
A second-class teacher in a department has
to teach classes, up to 70 children in some
schools, as well as to supervise the work of
the lower-class teachers. Any teacher who
aims at making his store of knowledge suffi-
cient only for the needs of the hoiir, who
cannot see a worthy motive for emulation
in the success of his fellow-teachers, has mis-
taken his vocation.
■ •
The indefatigable Ettie Rout, who, on re-
sults, was the world’s greatest war-worker,
has published another pamphlet—“ Two Years
in Paris.” The following may be studied
with advantage by the politicians: —
Almost every Australian, Maorilander and South
African who came to Paris during 1918 and 1919
received efficient instruction in prophylaxis and sup-
plies, and the result was that these men were the
cleanest soldiers on leave in Paris.
What Ettie Rout and her devoted band of
helpers did for the A.I.F. in a small way the
State could begin doing for the citizens in
a big way to-morrow. The expenditure would
be repaid ten thousand times over, inside a
very few years, in the form of diminished
hospital and asylum cases alone. Another
royal income would be represented by a huge
volume of industrial efficiency which at pre-
sent is lost. All the armies soon recognised
what a ruinous demobiliser and hospital-
filler V.D. was, and all eventually resorted
to prophylaxis. That the work done by
Ettie Rout and her friends alone was worth,
first and last, several divisions to the Allies
no one who has examined the figures can
doubt; and, as for prophylaxis in general, it
is not too much to say that but . for it the
war might have been lost. It is not too
much to say either that Australia, which
needs man-power more than any of the great
nations, may be lost nationally. as well as
financially if it goes on neglecting prophy-
laxis. The attitude of the objectors in Bri-
tain is bitingly stated :
They appear to desire to maintain Venereal Disease
as a "Material Hell, into which to drop offenders
against the Conventional Code. The modern form
of torture is, first, to poison the man with syphilis,
and then poison his wife —syphilis, as a famous
French doctor once remarked, being divided between
husband and wife as the daily bread. In this wa
the twain are to be reduced to their knees with
Bible in one hand and a Little Child —probaDi.
syphilitic —in the other !
Over-populated Britain may be able to
afford to offer this ghastly sacrifice on the
altar of the Moloch of Respectability: Aus-
tralia certainly cannot.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Prime Minister Bruce got away last week
with all his retinue thick upon him. If he
gets a cold reception at first it must be re-
membered that another Australian Prime
Minister visited England three times (in
1916, 1918 and 1921), and that a recurrent
record of default in the Federal accounts,
“Debt to British Government, £90,388,604,”
is the most conspicuous memorial of his
adventures.
The end of the “crisis” in N.S.W. Assem-
bly was reached on August 30, when Brux-
ner and his Progressives fell in behind Ful
ler’s Nationalists on the Labor no-confidence
motion being put to the vote. It had pre-
viously been arranged that the Auditor-
General should report on the matter in dis-
pute between the Bruxners and the Fullers
—whether £549,000 should be paid as com-
pensation to the growers of 1916-17 wheat
or be swallowed up in the £855,000 they
are alleged to have been overpaid, owing to
gross mismanagement of the pool. It took
three weeks to debate the business and pull
the necessary strings, and Parliament hadn’t
done a tap of work since November 22. The
N.S.W. politician earns his salary easily.
With the help of Labor, Premier Lawson
achieved a pyrrhic victory in the Vic. Assem-
bly last week. Another such win and he
will be undone, if the undoing is not already
in process. Finance Minister McPherson
circulated slips setting forth that two months’
supply would be asked for next day. Fol-
lowed a metropolitan Liberal conspiracy to
trip up the Ministry by reducing the amount
50 per cent. Alec Peacock, while having a
lemonade or something before leaving the
House for the night, got the tip and became
busy. Next morning one month’s supply
was substituted, and the conspirators were
foiled for the nonce. Then they put up
Deany to move that the Chairman leave the
chair—a device that hadn’t been tried in
Vie. Assembly since 1900. Eleven Cockies
supported the proposal, but they were joined
by only six city and two country Libs., while
20 Laborites reinforced eight Ministers and
eight more or less loyal followers. Labor
loves Lawson little, but detests Cockydom
for slipping it up two years ago.
The strange delay of the Theodore Gov-
ernment in ushering in the Millennium is
perturbing the “advanced” Queensland Labor-
ites who voted for it. It is moodily recalled
that the first three measures passed by the
new Parliament were Diseases in Poultry,
Pest Destroyers and Dingo and Marsupial
Destruction Act Amendment. “S’pose when
they’ve killed off the pests, they’ll have a go
at us,” was the ambiguous comment of one
oppressed wage-slave rightly struggling to
be free.
The Westralian Redistribution of Seats
Bill, which threatens to push five goldfield
Assemblymen out of employment, is also
likely to make Scaddan’s position precarious
at Albany. As submitted in the rough, it
provides for a new rural constituency called
Plantagenet, consisting of portion of Katan-
ning (a safe C.P. seat) and a strong
Agrarian section of Albany. This section
it was that gave Scaddan his majority at
the last two elections, and enabled him to
push into the Cabinet as Minister of Mines
and Railways. Plantagenet would be easy
if Scaddan got the C.P. nomination, but the
cockies want a local man, and there is a
possibility that the man who was Labor,
Independent, Nationalist and Country, party
inside four years will try his luck in one
of the new metropolitan constituencies. In
which case Albany may go Labor again.
Week-end views of a man in the Gallery :
Treasurer McPherson has been the unwitting cause
of the severe jolts administered to Premier Lawson
of late. His close cheeseparing has given the
dissatisfied metropolitan Liberals a good excuse for
attempting to force a general reconstruction, in
which the three non-Labor sections outside the Minis-
try would have a voice. Allan, the Cocky leader,
would be willing to join Lawson in some such loose
alliance as that between Bruce and Earle Page; but
he would prefer Peacock as leader, and there is no
doubt that the Kookaburra would command the affec-
tion of a united House. The root difficulty is
McPherson. No one likes him particularly, but
everybody fears to drop him, because that would be
blasphemy in the eyes of the daily Press. The man
who balances the ledger six or seven years in succes-
sion is a phenomenon demanding respect, though this
success has been achieved by blue-pencilling many
items of necessary expenditure. Meantime the Labor
erowd is enjoying the rumpus. The spectacle of
Lawson plaintively asking his followers to stop
bickering and get on with business is as provocative
of coarse mirth as that of Greenwood and Farthing,
violent opponents on the liquor question, joined
together as brothers-in-arms in the big push against
the Government.
PREPARING FOR THE CAMPAIGN.
Early reports of the Dail Eireann election
suggested that the day had gone badly for
the De Valera diehards. But Proportional
Representation gave them seats that they
couldn’t have won otherwise, and in the end
there were 44 Republican members against
63 supporters of the Free State Government.
Sixteen Independents, 15 Farmers and 15
Laborites make up the Chamber of 153
deputies. Most of the Independents ‘and
Farmers and a few, at least, of the Labor-
ites are supposed to be pro-Treaty, but the
Republicans—they include De Valera, Count
Plunkett, Countess Markievicz and other
irreconcilables—are numerous enough to be
capable of mischief, should they decide to
take their seats. That, of course, will in-
volve swearing allegiance to the Free State
Constitution and fidelity to George V.
From north of the Speaker’s nose:—
Truce or no truce, some well-informed members
of the N.S.W. Assembly are preparing for an early
anpeal to the country. The Progressives have no
liking for a Government of which Fuller is boss.
Although he has to rely upon the votes of that
group, Fuller never thinks of consulting it when
a little courtesy might inspire some friendliness.
A clash will come sooner or later. Perhaps before
Christmas.
While the Vic. Lawson Government was
debating whether it should resign or not, it
acquired another supporter in R. H. McLeod.
On McLeod’s appeal against the result of
the Daylesford by-election, the Elections and
Qualifications Committee decided that ballot-
papers obtained by impersonation and other
fraudulent devices had been included iu the
Labor total, and declared McLeod the win-
ner, instead of the loser by two votes. Com-
ing on top of the selection-ballot revelations
in N.S.W., and the prevalence of ghosts in
Queensland, the Daylesford case suggests
that the only way to secure absolutely clean
ballots is to revive the old elector’s right,
with the modern improvements of photo-
graphs and finger-prints.
The Tasmanian claim for continuance of
the special Federal grant is still before Par-
liament. Its original 10 years expired in
June, 1922. The State claimed renewal for
a further term. In its hurry to rush the
Country party to election during a harvest,
the Hughes Government could not last year
afford time to deal with this claim. So a
temporary arrangement was made to con-
tinue the grant a further 12 months. Now
Bruce, in his' hurry to shut up Parliament
and get off to England, has followed last year’s
bad example and pushed through another
temporary measure for 12 months. Labor
Senators were rebellious; but Ogden, on that
side, put forward a strong case for the
State; and when the bill was carried Gar-
diner had the joy of pointing out to Tas-
mania that it had got its reprieve on the plea
of a Laborite while the Speck’s National-
ists remained dumb —in accordance with
party instructions not to consume Bruce’s
precious time, no doubt.
Bradford is the centre of England’s fine
cloth-manufacture, and a wail in the London
Daily Express describes it as one of Eng-
land’s “devastated areas.” Said the paper’s
Jeremiah :
I have just seen . a Bradford house with shelves
and rooms packed with French textiles. ... Travellers
for local houses are all returning, declaring that it
is useless to show their samples. No retailer will
look at Bradford cloths, seeing that the French
manufacturers, owing to the rate of exchange, can
undercut us by Is. and more per yard.... The
Roubaix workers are throwing the Bradford workers
out of work as surely as if they were devastating
the city with howitzers. Continental manufacturers
having, through tariffs, complete control of their
home markets, from which they pay all overhead
charges, can descend on the British market like the
wolf on the fold.
The unemployed in the United Kingdom
were recently estimated at 1.200,000, and
those in France at 4000. Still the Free-
trade Briton is evidently getting cheap cloth
—if it is worth having at the price of going
naked. Bradford was one of the English
towns which the census-man found to be
losing population in 1921, and it seems to
have kept on losing.
Some of the best-known and least horny-
handed Communists in Sydney had a spurt
of anger recently, and demanded that “capi-
talists” should join in a debate or long-
distance chattering match, on the ground
that someone had said that capital and ex-
pert knowledge are necessary to the higher
forms of industry. Said the dashing ex-
parson Garden: —
No economist the world over has ever taken upon
himself to make such a statement. An elementary
student of economics has the knowledge that labor
produces all wealth.
Certainly a student, provided he is elemen-
tary enough, knows a lot of things that he
gets rid of later. Anyhow, the matter isn’t
W’orth arguing. A simple test would be to
start the long-overdue Labor daily without
capital, and produce wealth out of it by
labor alone. Incidentally, if there is no
wealth save what labor produces, how on
earth do the Gardens live?
One of those great ideas that gladden the
soul is forecasted by Ball, Minister for
Needlessly-long Railways in N. S. Wales.
It is proposed to relieve the Railway Depart-
ment of the loss on non-paying lines, and
with this burden gone it is hoped the Depart-
ment will be able to give better terms to “the
producer.” Of course, the community won’t
be relieved (that could only be done by pay-
ing oft' or repudiating over 26 millions of
debt), but the loss will be charged to some
other account. While the Treasury is in
this happy faking mood it might relieve the
Treasurer of a burden of nine millions per
annum by charging the interest on the
public debt to the Attorney-General’s office,
or something like that. It is all make-
believe and “saving face.” No vote-chasing
politician cares about things being better if
they can make a pretence of looking better.
The Bolshevik may have no money to pay
his debts or to feed his starving subjects,
but the funds for propaganda don’t fail.
Havelock Wilson, secretary to the British
Seamen’s Union, recently wrote about the
Soviet’s poisonous activities in England:—
It is really .difficult to know who does not get
paid from Moscow. They appear to have a System
of selecting certain men as paid agents to delivei
red-hot stuff, checked by a system of espionage as
to results. The Communists issue leaflets dealing
with the out-of-works, and make them as hot as
they can. Copies are then sent to Moscow, and if
up to the taste of the Lenin-Trotsky brigade they
get a subsidy.
Certainly, it is “difficult to know who is not
paid from Moscow,” but in Australia a good
many who are can be identified easily enough.
One even comes to know the marks of their
feet on the soapbox at the corner. They
are mostly imported as well as unproductive
nuisances, and their re-exportation to their
native lands might save much trouble later
on.
In some respects the resemblance of one
politician to another is only equalled by his
similarity to himself. This is especially
noticeable when the loan estimates happen
along. As witness this brief summary at
the head of the usual kind of Federal Par-
liamentary report
During the second reading of the Loan Bill for
£4,500,000 in the House of Representatives the
Treasurer explained that the net amount to be
raised by the Commonwealth for the current
year was £20,249,048, which included nearly
£1,000,000 for borrowing expenses.
So not only the debt but actually the cost
of raising the debt is left to Posterity!
France is taking no chances with sparks
now that Europe is a powder-magazine. Two
men lately arrested had attended the unveil-
ing of a war memorial and shouted, “Down
with war! Long live peace!” The charge
against them was “inciting the public to
sedition.”
An example of the gentle art of shirking:
The Minister for Customs informed Mr. Coleman
(N.S. W.) that representations had not been made
for an increase in the duty on imported moving-
pictures, but such, if made, would be considered.
The local film-makers don’t make much fuss,
because they are hardly strong enough to
be audible. The importers won’t “repre-
sent,” because they have no desire to pay
heavier duties. The public takes its film as
it comes, and knows little about the disas-
trous outpouring of Australia’s gold to the
U.S. But it pays the Minister to know
these things and to look after them. If it
was a case of raising Ministers’ pay he pro-
bably wouldn’t wait till petitions poured in
beseeching him for the love of Mike to take
more money.
A proposal is afoot to establish still an-
other borrowing authority in N. S. Wales.
The plan is that a Main Roads Board should
be empowered to borrow £5,000,000 with-
out needless formality. After that it can,
with the Treasurer’s consent, borrow lots
more millions. Between 1856 and 1922 the
Ma State raised £70,000,000 from land-
sales. As the sales represented the disposal
of the children’s patrimony, it would have
been fair to leave them some roads and
railways free of debt in exchange. But the
State didn’t; instead it has borrowed just
short of £1 per acre on sold and unsold land
alike. It is time a new borrowing scheme
arrived: the poor burdened kid was begin-
ning to feel neglected.
RUHR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tangle of battering tides,
Passions of surface and deep,
Where the Storm AVitch, hovering, bides,
Leaning to launch to her leap!
Ruhr! There’s a gloom in it—
Fringe to a midnight appalling.
Ruhr! There’s a doom in it —
Voices of prophecy calling.
Racial antipathies’ edges
Grating and fretting and raw;
History claiming its pledges,
And the “eye for an eye” of the Law.
Ruhr! There’s a threat in it,
Savage and menacing all!
Ruhr! There’s blood-sweat in it,
Oozing and ready to fall !
Is it a challenge of Fate?
God keep thee nought but a word,
Thou symbol of smouldering hate,
Thou shriek of the half-drawn sword!
Ruhr! There’s a moan in it,
Like women-folk wordlessly crying.
Ruhr! There’s a groan in it,
Like strong men, dreadfully dying!
Turn from us these, good Lord!

Underwriting for tlse year ended May, 1922,
showed a loss of £39,605 ; 3.7 p.c._ more than
net premium receipts was paid out m
claims and exes. Besides that, £Lo,ooowas
withdrawn from a reserve for taxes. Uur-
ing the past 12 months there was an all-
round improvement, though the co. was still
beating up against an unfavorable breeze:
the underwriting margin was slender, losses
and exes, taking all except 5i p.c. of net
premium income. However, that small per-
centage on a turnover exceeding a million
runs ‘ into big figures, and, including in-
vestment earnings, the co. closed its accounts
with a surplus of 241 p.c. on three-quarters
of a million of capital. Reserves, after pay-
ment of the final divs., were made up as
follows: —
Reserve fund £ K97’?nn
Reserve for unexpired risks .. ••
Investment fluctuation reserve .. •• -.loisi
Profit and Loss balance .. .. • • 1-.o,idi
£1,127,318
There is also £60,000 in a taxation reserve
which is probably an accumulation of true
profit held for use should taxation press too
heavily on earnings by-and-bye. Last year
interest from the investment of all these
funds turned in £101,249, compared with
£60,851 won from underwriting. The differ-
ence between the sum of these two accounts
and the profits shown by the first table, is
£19,859, which was an unexplained addition
to the investment fluctuation and contingency
reserve. Possibly that reflects some of the
market appreciation of securities not dnectly
taken credit for as profit in the accounts.

formances for many years:

The div. rate has been lifted a trifle—-
from Is. 4d. to Is. sd. per share-and though
the year’s underwriting did not appear to
warrant l distribution larger than at any
other time in the co.'s career, note that m-
terest earnings alone provided all excep
£5OOO of the divs. Thus £ll of every £l2 of
underwriting surplus remained in the office.
The size of reserves compared with capital
accounts for the happy position: the N.Z.
Insurance is, nowadays, an nivestment con
cern as well as an underwriter, the £750,000
of scrip reaping the harvest from the invest-
ment of two millions or so. The astonish-
ing results during war years were respon-
sible : notwithstanding the risks of that
period, losses were comparatively light and
larger margins on inflated values of all
insurables gave fat surpluses. In the 9J
years since November, 1913, there has been
a visible lay-by of £834,000 aftey paying ve y
handsome divs. The div. rates in t • e m
ductory table disclose only a little ot tffe
glitter of the distributions. Ten years ago
Daid capital was £300,000, but in the next
half-dozen years £450,000 of bonus scrip was
emotied out of reserves; so on actual casn
paid capital the latest div. gave a trifle more
than 35 pc. The co. has done so magnifi-
cently that at the moment every £1 share
los. has the backing of more than
20s. of the best-quality assets after making
a 40 p.c. allowance for re-insurance of un-
expired risks. In the published accounts the
reservation under that head was slightly
more than one-half the net premiums.
The N.Z. Insurance is very snug from the
point of view of insurers. Funds at May 31
totalled £1,037,312; they were eoual to more
than 180 p.c. of last year’s net premium in-
come and almost sufficient to cover claims
three times greater than last year’s losses.
That does not take into account £750,000 ot
uncalled capital. The balance-sheet total has
doubled in 10 years, and this comparison
shows where funds have gone :

All* available funds have been invested in Gov-
ernment securities, and no less than 80 p.c.
of the present total is there or in deposits
and cash assets. A feature of the comparison is
that only £10,300 is now out on mortgage
compared with £195,872 10 years ago.^

When profits are sufficiently large share-
holders have two bites: their first is the
usual 10 p.c. div.—there were p.c. sweet-
eners during the fat war-years—and next
they snap up bonus scrip. Since 1908
bonuses totalling £125,000 have been dis-
tributed to permit holders to buy nevv scrip
at par, and in the 15 years paid capital has
thus increased from £55,000 to £lBO,OOO.
But in this instance, as with the Daily
Telegraph and other cos. which made a
habit of these more or less regular free-
scrip distributions, the process cannot con-
tinue indefinitely, nor can the investment
be safely valued on the basis of its continu-
ance. All the same, the wide margin be-
tween the average profits of the past seven
years and the dividend certainly makes it
look something more than a 10 p.c. proposi-
tion. The past year’s profits were easily
the best in the co.’s 35 years; wool hand-
lings increased by 17,000 bales, pastoral pro-
duce sales were larger, and the big live-
stock connection was well maintained.
Turnover amounted to almost 31 millions,
and the net trading profit was approximately
1 p.c. on total sales. Besides the £35,208
derived in that wav, interest on Wnr Loan
(£60,000) and fixed deposits (£50,000) con-
tributed £5626. Balance-sheet comparisons
going back nine years are as follows : —-

Liquid assets . . 60,980 111,605 111,605
Both creditors and debtors were larger on
this occasion owing to the financial year
having closed between a wool sale and settle-
ment-day. The book value of premises also
increased by about £25,000 owing to con-
siderable additions and improvements hav-
ing been made to wool and produce stores ;
but most of the co.’s building was
done just before the big rise in costs.
The co.’s position was still very comfort-
able: the £111,605 holding of War Loan and
deposits exceeded all liabilities by £7791.
The distribution of good divs. in future is
made easy by the £lBO,OOO of capital being
supported by £74,930 of reserves; funds have
to earn only slightly _ more _ than 7 p.c. to
produce 10 p.c. on paid capital.

This co. commenced writing policies 2£
years ago. and its tally of assurances for
periods ended June has been 1921, £38,300;
1922, £78,650; 1923, £100,250. Precisely
how much of the business written has been
retained is not disclosed, but the A.B.L.
appears to have done better than some of
the new offices: the management reports
that 65 p.c. of the policies written have been
renewed. The table discloses what a costly
undertaking it has been: in less than 24
years £13,716 of the paid capital of £18.505
has gone in winning and holding the volume
of assurances now on the books, in paying
the promotors’ cut (in shares), in initial ex-
penses and in costs of getting capital. Mean-
time, only £42 has been paid away in claims.
The society’s position at June 30 was as
follows:
Cash and War Bonds . . .. £7176
Book debts and agents’ balances 376
Premiums outstanding .. . . 198
Interest accrued .. .. .. 50
£7BOO
Sundry creditors .. . . 3842
Net liquid -assets .. .. £3958
Office furniture and fittings valued at £4Ol
and £430 of stationery are not included
with assets, because their worth would be
trifling if the society went into liquidation
Shareholders cannot even lay claim to the
£3958 of surplus assets; funds required to
cover the actuarial liability under policies
have a lien on portion of it. So to get thus-
far practically the whole of the paid capital
has gone, and if business writing continues
at the same expensive rate as in the past it
won’t be long before shareholders will have
to put up additional funds to protect policy-
holders—if policies are to be protected as
they should be. And it looks all the more
likely in view of the decision to open up
in Melbourne. Last year £7247 flowed out
to get in £5596, and on the basis that new
business costs 10 times old, the renewals
expense rate was 19 p.c., and new business
cost 190 p.c. If such high costs continue the
co. will go west as well as south.
So far there seems to be fair protection
for policy-holders. Besides the £3958 of
funds available for policy-liabilities, £13,462
more can be wrung from shareholders —at
least, there is that amount callable. The
immediate outlook for shareholders is, of
course, dismal. Even should the assurance
business from now onwards become self-
supporting—and there is small likelihood of
that for a long time—the co. would still be
faced with making good the actuary’s re-
quirements under policies, and also much
of the £13,716 of capital which has gone,
before finances would be sufficiently re-
stored to warrant shareholders entertaining
dreams of dividend warrants.

This provincial bank—it has never moved
outside Ballarat- —was the only little fellow
which was not gobbled up by the big fellows
a couple of years ago when amalgamations
and straight-out purchases were the fashion.
Perhaps its business was too small to attract
attention. It plods along in an unexciting-
way, making sufficient profit to pay its
shareholders a fair rate of div. —the 9 p.c.
for the past year represents p.c. on capi-
tal prior to the transfer of reserves in 1920
—and to lay a couple of thousands aside in
reserves each year. A feature of its busi-
ness is that of every £lOO of deposits almost
£74 is fixed and only £26 at current account.
Here are other balance-sheet comparisons
going back to 1915: —

Advances . . . . 311,533 372,835 420,483
Premises . . . . 2,597 5,000 5,000
During the past year liabilities expanded
£21,575 —most of it on fixed deposit—but
Ballarat was borrowing so hard that
advances soared £47,653. As a result liquid
assets at June 30 were only 31.2 p.c. of
total liabilities, which looks much too little,
though a good deal naturally depends on the
periods for which the comparatively large
fixed deposits are tied to the business. Be-
sides, of £102,918 of liquid assets only
£24,175 was in cash and deposits in other
banks, practically the whole of the balance
having been invested in Commonwealth and
State securities. However, the Common-
wealth Bank is its banker, and that weighty
connection might be useful if at any time
the co. found its cash holdings too small.
On paper the old Ballarat institution —it is
now in its 59th year—appears to offer excep-
tional security to its creditors. For every
£1 of its own funds it is holding only a
trifle more than 335. of the public’s money,
and to protect £226,630 of liabilities not
covered by liquid assets there are advances
for £420,488 and the £5OOO of premises. So
almost half the advances could become irre-
coverable before depositors need fear for
their money.

This co. took over the Haeketts’ Burnley
Leather Works at the height of an unprece-
dented boom in the industry. In its first
year everything seemed all right, but in the
next, after the market had crashed horribly,
and when stocks had been reviewed in the
light of new replacement values, a loss
of £27,180 was recorded, and including for-
mation costs and goodwill the accounts
showed that no less than £67,296 of the
£200,000 of paid capital was represented by
intangible assets. The prospects of even
the prefs. getting anything for a few years
would, under such circumstances, not have
looked bright. But the former owners of
the business did an unusual thing: they
promptly came forward with an offer to
cancel sufficient of their scrip to enable the co.
to sweep away trading and stock losses and
permit the payment of the prefs.’ divs. To
do that they surrendered £25,640 of shares,
and no matter how much they made out of
the float (and perhaps, after all, most of it
was on paper) their voluntary loss of capi-
tal must go down as one of the brightest
spots in the after-boom collapse. They were
under no legal obligation to do anything,
and only one vendor in a thousand would
have had any feeling of moral obligation in
the matter. As a direct result, the prefs.
were paid in full for the disastrous period,
and in the next year the ordinaries were
also able to get a bite again. However,
judging by the profits disclosed, the boom-
time float still appears to have proved too
much for the ordinaries. The £60,000 of
8 p.c. cum. prefs. seem to be on thoroughly
sound foundations. At June 30 debts totted
up under £6OOO, with perhaps a thousand or
so required for taxation. On the other side
were these tangible assets: Freeholds, plant
and machinery, £52,827; stocks, £65,488:
cash and public securities, £11,400; and
book debts, £23,349.

The Colonial Provident Life and
General Assurance Co., Ltd.—Some of the
objectionable features which have crept into
recent life floats are absent from this newest
venture. For a start the promoter takes no
cash; for introducing the co. he is to get
17,000 £1 fully-paid ordinaries, but under-
takes to pay portion of the preliminary
costs. His shares will be of no value until
such time as operations become profitable.
The public is invited to subscribe 100,000
£1 ordinary shares to be called to ss. on
allotment and also 50,000 prefs. to be paid
to £l. The latter are not to be a load on
the concern from the beginning, because their
10 p.c. is non-cumulative ; but they have first
call on assets in a wind-up, and are to share
rateably with the ordinaries in one-half of
any surplus profit after both parties have
had 10 p.c. The other half of surplus profits
are to go to participating policy-holders;
and that means that, should the co. reach the
bonus-paying stage, the insurer would find
the Colonial Provident less co-operative than
most —usually four-fifths of profits are ear-
marked for policy-holders. •
. Of course, the prospectus is very talkative
about the immense profits to be won from
life assurance and general insurance: the
co., by the way, proposes to dabble in all
lines except Industrial. But even assuming
that the management is to be something
special, for investors the likelihood of suc-
cess within a reasonable period is as mucn
a long-shot chance as in most other recent
ventures. However, it is refreshing to find a
promoter who undertakes to “adhere to the
accepted maxim of the insurance world:
that big business, unless obtained at reason-
able cost, is not necessarily good business,
and who proposes to “consolidate sound busi-
ness in one State before extending into
others.” On the other hand, there are loose
statements in the prospectus; for instance,
“it may be emphasised that shares now
offered at par will, in all probabilitynext
year be sold at a premium.” If that is put
forward to influence subscriptions to the first
issues it is most improper; because the first
year’s operations cannot, under the most

favorable conditions, give any true indica-
tion of the value of the shares. Some of the
young cos. have had the impudence to sell
new shares at a premium, but in many cases
sales have been effected by unscrupulous “go-
getters” preying on the ignorance of the public
by misrepresentation. The Colonial Provi-
dent’s scrip will be worth more than par
only when divs. are definitely in sight, and
that certainly won’t be next year—probably
not for many years to come, and perhaps
never. That is the risk the shareholder takes.
“Old Banker” : Is it not time the gold com-
mandeered by the Commonwealth Govern-
ment from "the banks as a forced loan
to the Australian notes account was repaid V
The Federal surplus ought to be transferred
to pay off this highly-irregular debt of the
Federal Government. If £10,000,000 of
gold was handed back to the banks, that
amount of notes could be withdrawn from
issue and cancelled. It would be a step
towards honoring the Government’s promise
to pay its own notes in cash on demand. A
transaction carried through under the duress
of war conditions may have been justifiable,
though irregular. To perpetuate it through
peace times is not creditable to the Govern-
ment, which ought to set an example of
honesty to its citizens.

Interest in AVestralian oil has been re-
vived a little by the issue of reports by the
Freney and Okes-Durack cos. The former’s
accounts for the year ended June 30 show
£3861 of revenue: £2501 cash from sale of
options, and £1360 interest from fixed de-
posits. Expenditure, of which barely half
is represented by boring and most of the
balance by administration costs, directors’
fees, etc., total £14,699. To date the co. has
spent about £26,500, and, in addition to
plant, casing, diamonds, etc., with a book
vale of £10,954, has £21,410 of cash left.
This should be sufficient for two years’
operations. Meantime a pressing invita-
tion has been given an American oil-produc-
ing_and -selling corporation to come in on a
50-50 basis. A plant capable of boring to.a
depth of 4000 ft. is being hurried to Mt.
Wynne, where the management recently re-
ported the presence of bitumen carrying a
high percentage of petrolene in the trial bore.
Another drill has also been despatched to
Poole’s Range to stab an anticline there.
Okes Duraek Co., whose bore site is 180 miles
south of Wyndham and a mile or two from
the S.A. border, announces that its first drill
is down 500 ft. through shale and mudstone,
and that it is quite satisfied with results
to date.
* * * *
Hampton Properties (W.A.) seems to have
a chance at Mount Martin Block 45. The
co. has a 10-hd. mill with leaching and filter-
press plant at work, suction gas being em-
ployed for motive power. For the first two
months difficulty was experienced with the
slimes treatment,, and returns only just
covered expenses. For July, although the
slimes difficulty was not quite overcome.
1070 tons were mille_d for a return of £2115
and a profit of £565. Working costs were
about 295. The management expects to put
through about 1200 tons per month from now
on, and better results are expected. The
directors propose to put all profits into de-
veloping the show. There is a large area to
test, and only the surface has been worked
so far. Hampton Properties has for years
been seeking a mine—the last venture was
the Lady Miller, at Norseman—but so far it
has had no luck. It is the biggest share-
holder in the Celebration, having put about
£20,000 into it, but, unless things improve
agood deal, it won’t get much back there.
The Mt. Martin show has about a year’s
supply of ore available for the mill, hut a
lot more work will have to be done to prove
the mine.

Chairman F. A. Govett. said a lot about
the “strong position and dividend prospects”
of Lake View Investment Trust at the
annual meeting in London. He estimated
the market value of the co.’s varied holdings
—there are over 100 —at about 255. per
share, or, say, 10s. more than their present
quoted price. The co. is now beginning to
receive divs. on its one-fourteenth interest
in the Burma Corporation, and Govett holds
out the prospect of Lake View paying half-
yearly divs. of 6 p.c., with prospects of im-
provement. Shareholders showed their be-
lief in Govett’s optimism by overwhelmingly
rejecting a well-known Stock Exchange man
who stood as an opposition candidate for
the Board, and whose declared policy was
to press for a voluntary winding-up and dis-
tribution of assets.
Meekatharra (W.A.) goldfield in the last
H years has produced over a million ounces.
Once it had several large producers and div.-
payers, but only one of these, Ingliston Con-
sols, in which is incorporated its old rival,
the Fenian, now remains. Of the many cos.
which have operated on the field without
success some frittered their money away
buying treatment plants when they hadn’t
sufficient ore to treat; others did a little
rough-and-ready prospecting and then came
to the end of their cash, and others, as one
expert reported, “simply had their money
stolen from them under false pretexts.” There
is a large area of auriferous country around
Meekatharra well worth exploiting, and a
co. with ample funds and not loaded by ven-
dors has more than a sporting chance of
finding a mine.
Lake View and Star (W.A.) made two
cheering announcements the other day. One
was that the new plant was running con-
tinuously, and the other that high-grade
sulpho-telluride ore had been met in driving
at 2300 ft. The co.’s early re-appearance on
the div. list is confidently predicted by opti-
mists, but as costs under present working
conditions at Kalgoorlie are high, and as it
takes £25,000, exclusive of taxes, to pay
shareholders a 6d. div., it will probably be
some time, even under favorable circum-
stances, before the co. will be in a position
to make a distribution.
The supply of new finds having run short
in Westralia, worked-out and abandoned
mines are being eagerly optioned for flota-
tion in Perth and Adelaide. The latest to
be acquired for this purpose are the Emerald
and Monarch, at Yalgoo. Both shows have
been abandoned for years, and, when last
heard of, had nothing of value in sight. The
Emerald yielded sensational returns in the
early ’nineties, but the shoot, a flat, boat-
shaped formation, petered out at shallow
depth. The workings have been under water
ever since. The Monarch’s production to
the end of 1913 was about 30000 z., but that
was the output of several years. The show
was abandoned when the grade became too
low to pay.
* * * *
Paringa Co., of Westralia and elsewhere,
is issuing 767,250 reserve Is. shares. With
some of the £38,000 which it hopes to get in
the directors propose to proceed with develop-
ment on the Kalgoorlie lease and at a newly-
acquired option at Waverley, on the Broad
Arrow field. The latter show is declared to
offer “great possibilities,” but that and
more was said years ago about some other
shows in the same district which produced
a little gold and then snuffed out.
* * * *
Manxman district, five miles north of Bull-
finch, is now the bright spot in Westralian
mining. There the Radio, recently equipped
with a small treatment plant, has so far
milled about 2000 tons for an average gold
recovery of £l4 per ton. Radio is owned
by Barr and Clements, and, as they are treat-
ing 30 tons ore weekly, big profits are
being won. The reef near surface, although
high-grade, is narrow, but down 180 ft. it has
widened to lift. Last year the show was
inspected on behalf of a buyer who offered
£30,000 cash, but no sale resulted. Since
then it has been sampled for a London
crowd, but results did not prompt them to
part with the £40,000 cash asked by the
vendors. T. Duff and N. Stuckey, formerly
of Edna May Deeps, have now secured an
option on the same terms, and propose to
float in Melbourne. Should the lift, of ore
at 180 ft. go 3oz. over the full width, and the
shoot prove to be of good length, the Radio
should be an attractive proposition. But
£40,000 cash is a big price to ask for a mine
not thoroughly developed, even though the
ore so far exposed is high-grade. The mine has
not been pig-rooted for the rich stuff; the
stopes stand almost solid from the 180 ft. level
up. Should Duff and Stuckey succeed with
the flotation the public will be offered other-
leases in the vicinity. Floats are in pros-
pect in connection with Glideaway and
llackett’s leases.

South Kalgurli (W.A.) is financially
strong. The accounts show bullion, cash,
fixed deposits and investments for £89,086.
The surplus over and above all liabilities is
£68,694. Stores (£8052) and odds and ends
lift _the total to £77,979. Raid capital is
£125,033. According to the directors the
book value of investments is considerably less
than their market value. Recently the co.
found that as the winder at its main-shaft
was no longer capable of rendering service
below 1730 ft., a new plant would have to be
installed or a second-hand one obtained. A
cash offer of £35,000 was made for the
joining Perseverance mine and plant, but the
liquidator of that co. refused the bid. A
further offer to guarantee 700,000 shares of
Is. each in the proposed reconstructed Perse-
verance, conditionally on the South Kalgurli
being given the call on a further 600,000
unissued shares, met with the same fate.
The management hag' now decided to trans-
fer the hauling-plant on the old Hainault
lease, which is capable of hoisting from
2500 ft. Dismantling and re-erecting will
cost about £3OOO.
A poor yield from Brown’s Reward (W.A.)
has been followed by an official report advis-
ing that another “new find” is looking well.
This is the second “new find” reported from
Brown’s this year. The first was a small
lens of 3oz. ore that provided one small
crushing and then cut out. Meanwhile
Brown’s lode, which was the main attraction,
has proved a duffer.
Subscribers to Brown’s Reward Central
(W.A.) are anxiously awaiting some infor-
mation concerning mine developments, or, at
least, to be advised as to what has become
of their cash.

Since Melbourne took up 35,000 reserved
shares at a premium in the Crown gold-
mine, Bombandy Mountain (N.S.W.), the
developmental policy has chopped and
changed in bewildering fashion. Two adit
tunnels are being leisurely driven towards
the reefs in order to give 150 ft. of backs.
The prospecting shaft on the main or “C”
reef has been sunk to 84ft., or about 150 ft.
below the cap of the hill. At 50ft. drives
are being burrowed into the known enrich-
ment thereabout, and the shaft is to be
filled for 34ft. with this high-grade ore, which
will have to be re-handled later for treat-
ment. Pig-rooting never accomplished much
for apy mine, but the Crown hopes to be
the exception. Groups interested in keeping
share values down have not been slow to
attribute this filling of the prospecting shaft
to something more than a desire to stack
ore therein. This gibe may be quite uncalled
for, but market operators are prone to put
the worst construction on such happenings.
• # * *
Crown South Gold Options (N.S.W.) is
a contradictory concern. Last week the
mine manager reported that a pothole near
the southern boundary had been “sunk to
a depth of 10ft. on narrow veins of quartz
carrying a little gold, but the amount of
conglomerate overlying the surface renders
prospecting difficult.” That is definite
enough. Contrast it with a statement in a
prospectus issued by the Options asking the
public to lift shares from the underwriters
in a tardy float in which 200,000 shares of
ss. each are offered : “Ninety feet from the
south boundary of the Crown South the reef
has beeti exposed on the surface in two places
and shows 4ft. 6in. wide.”
Bob Johnston has had a clean-up on Ins
dredging-plant operating on the old Elsie
ground, Tent Hill, near Emmaville
(N.S.W.), and the result did not call for
much rejoicing. Better ground is expected
ahead, and the next run should show an
improvement.
* * * *
Gulf Tin Dredging Co., Emmaville
(N.S.W.), which was a Chinese co., has
given up the ghost and sold its plant to
Thompson Bros., of Inverell. The Thomp-
sons intend to try their luck on one of the
creeks at Torrington, a. district whose re-
fractory lodes have been responsible for a
couple of notable failures.
J. Weir has re-opened the old work-
ings of the Gulf Mountain tin. Emmavilie
(N.S.W.), and good tin values are reported
from a drive at the 100 ft. ley el. The reef
has not been worked for 25 years. The
show yielded 369 tons tin prior to closure.

“W’gab'ba”: Gold-mining in Queensland
is a spoon-fed industry nowadays. It is
almost impossible to get adequate private
capital in. Normanby raised some, but
leaned on the Government right through.
The Palmer people have had liberal assist
ance in one form or another to test the
reefs there. Charters Towers had a free
drilling campaign. Now the Madden-
Buchanan people are suppliants for subsi-
dies. Mt. Qoolon field seems the_ sturdiest ot
the gold babies, and is well on its own feet
so far as its chief mines are concerned.
Nevertheless, some of the cos. want the
Government to put up a battery to test
their ore. Considering all the assistance from
the State, it is sheer bad luck that Queens-
land has not added a few substantial pro-
ducers to its string of gold-mines. Or, per-
haps, it simply means that when private
capital will not come in the chances are
pretty hopeless.
* * * *
Operations on the remarkable silver-lead
discovery 25 miles north of Chillagoe (Q.)
are being watched by Geologist St. Smith,
who is to report to Mines Minister Jones.
The latter is much elated in view of what
the discovery may mean for the State
smelters at Chillagoe. P. L. Goddard, _ man-
ager at the smelters, is most enthusiastic,
and considers it is likely to be “the Broken
Hill of Queensland.” The remarkable aspect
of the discovery is that it was not made years
ago, as there are strong ridgy outcrops of
lead-carbonate and galena, and the noted
mineral district has been well prospected in
the past.
Normanby (N.Q.) field has been refused
the free use of the Mines Department’s
diamond-drilling plant recently in commission
at the Towers. If those operating there
want to drill they will have to find the cash.
J. Berry, who did the drilling at the Palmer
and the Towers, has returned to the former
field to take charge at the Ida, whose shaft
is to go deeper. The Minister for Mines has
already given the Palmer syndicate assist-
ance, and is banking on Dr. Jack’s theory
that good gold should be struck in the second
bed of slate.
* * * *
The hope of Mareeba (N.Q.) a couple of
years back was the new Minnie Moxham;
but it has had a struggle ever since to scrape
up payable ore. Something like £l5OO was
spent to bring the mine in again and equip
it with a better plant, but the lode has failed
to yield the hoped-for results. There is a
large formation, but the shoots are too small.
At present the footwall lode carries a shoot
Bin. to 12in. thick assaying anything up to
60z., but apart from this the bottom level
(210 ft.) looks poor and scarcely encourages
sinking. The fate of the mine hangs on the
footwall shoot, and efforts are now being-
made to prove its extent. If this disappoints
a last shot might be made by sinking below
210 ft. on the off-chance of striking a stray
shoot.
* * * *
Clark’s, Charters Towers (N.Q.), which
has not been over-blessed with pay shoots for
a long time, is now showing a fair reef in the
winze 100 ft. below No. 11 level. Up to Sin.
of fairly mineralised stone has been un-
covered, and driving, has commenced on it.
The stopes above No. 10 are pretty low, but
a small block at No. 7 is providing crushings.
It’s just two years since the .last div. was
handed out.
* * * *
Stanhills field (N.Q.) is dead at present,
except for a new show, the Mauretania,
which holds some promise. The lode is
opened to a depth of only 25ft., but a good
chlorite formation in granite is indicated by
outcrops, and the size of it —in places sft. or
Oft. wide —warrants prospecting. Chlorite
has often been an associate of tin in New
England and North Queensland tinfields. The
Mauretania has been turning out small par-
cels of 20 p.c. ore, and a length of 30ft. has
been proved to carry payable values. More
.should be heard of the show.
* * * *
A proposal to open up the previously-
worked Taliamba copper-mine, near Silver-
spur (Q.), seems to have faded away. The
saving grace of this mine would probably
lie in the silver values: they are unusually
high for association with copper, assays in
excess of 40oz. being common. The ore in
places carried gold also, but values could
not be relied on. The workings are down
to 110 ft., and samples there assayed up to
15 p.c. copper. Any scheme for reworking
would have to provide for treatment of.ore
at the mine, as it is 45 miles from the Goon-
diwindi railway at its nearest point.

"Lex”: A magisterial decision which is
almost certainly wrong has been given in
Sydney in the case of William John Baird,
who proceeded against Gladys Sharpe for
detaining the engagement-ring he had given
THE LOCUM TENENS.
DISTINGUISHED SITTER (newly knighted): “Are you
quite sure, now , you will be able to get a model
to pose in my robes for the figure?"
PORTRAIT-PAINTER: “Quite. Some of the old chaps we
pick up will do anything for a few shillings."
her. The wary lover had drawn up a num-
ber of agreements in respect of the ring,
with blanks for the insertion of the lady’s
name. They provided for its return in the
event of a rift appearing in love’s lute, but
Gladys, who seems to have been equally cau-
tious, refused to sign them. Nevertheless, it
is more than doubtful if the ring is hers.
The case of Moss Jacobs v. Fanny Davis,
which was fought out in the London King’s
Bench Division half a dozen years ago, settled
the point. In this matter Justice Shear-
man observed that, even where the woman
did not contract to hand back the ring, the
man had a right to claim it. This is reason-
able, in view of the origin of the engage-
ment-ring custom. The ring began by being
a sign that the husband in embryo had
bought the girl from her parents. Later,
woman ceased to be a chattel, and the ring
became a pledge or arrabo in a contract to
marry, which is what it is to this day. If
the girl breaks her side of the bargain she
clearly has no right to the valuable con-
sideration put up by her admirer to bind his
side.

puts up quick-voting records. The other
day the big, far-flung railway union of W.A.
held an election for general secretary. Sepa-
rated by hundreds of mulga miles from the
main railway system, there is a little line
between P'ort Hedland and Marble Bar.
Isolated though they are, its wages staff
are strict unionists, and, of course, had to
have their say in the ballot. The returning-
officer posted the papers on Aug. 9, and on
the 10th the papers were returned to him.
The coastal distance from Perth to Pt. Hed-

“D.” Apropos the Polycrates case (B.
30/8/’23), a histrionic Sydney Union Club
member used to give priceless imitations of
three other well-known members being “ap-
proached” by Tatt.’s ticket-holders. In the
case of Adrian Knox the emissary never
reached the presence. A clerk brought the
K.G. (as he then was) a note containing an
offer of £lOOO to run his horse straight.
Silently, implacably, Knox studied the out-
rage through his large round spectacles;
silently and implacably he tore it across and
deposited it in the w.p.b., and then without
comment turned to his desk again. Cohn
Stephen, the present A.J.C. chairman, sent
for the gentleman who was pining to thrust
25 per cent, of a Tatt.’s prize on him.
“Wh-h-hat the h—l’s the m-m-meanin’ of
this?" inquired Stephen passionately. “If
I d-d-did ray strict duty I’d send for the
police. Get out, and never d-dare to do such
a thing to a g-g-gentleman again.” Theo
Marks, most human and amiable of sports-
men, had the acid put on him without pre-
liminary warning. “I don’t want any of your
money, my dear chap,” lie said, laying an
encouraging hand on the shoulder of the
total stranger who had intercepted him.
“Keep it all, and good luck to you. As re-
gards my horse, if it’s any comfort to you I
may say that I’ve backed him to win me as
much as you’re likely to win.” The little
comedies might have been related to our old
friend ben trovato, but they cast piquant
lights on the characters of the three men
concerned.

About a famous dining-room :—-
No feeding-place in the world
has seen more vicissitudes than
London’s Crosby Hall, which is
now occupying the attention of
Dame Adelaide Anderson, form-
erly of Victoria, and the women’s
unions connected with Australian
universities. When it was built
the aristocracy of England gnawed
their food like the dogs which lay
in the straw at their feet waiting
for bones. Shakspeare, Ben Jon-
son and their friends foregathered
there; Holbein frequented it, and
so in another age did Swift, Vol-
taire and Gay, who at this time
happened to be living together.
And now the city began to creep
round it. Its deathknell was
sounded by England’s first ’ rail-
way engine. Liverpool-street sta-
tion was built within a few hun-
dred yards of it, and pallid city
men began to pour past the por-
tals that almost every famous
character in the history of the
nation has crossed. Next the
clerks began to swarm into it, for
it became a restaurant where
cheap lunches were provided.
Fifteen or sixteen years ago it
was shifted, stone by stone, to
Chelsea, and thereby it became
associated with another set of
literary and historical figures. On
its right, facing the river, is the
home of the Adams brothers, and
on the left the house in which
Carlyle did most of his later
work; and within a stone’s-
throw at the back are the places
where Wilde, Whistler and Leigh Hunt lived in their
heyday. The present idea is to make it a club-house
for university women. It certainly deserves to be
saved for some public purpose.

“S.S.”: This is the strange, true story of
a selector a few miles out from
desert (Q.). He returned from the war
with an English wife. Her new environ-
ment displeased the lady, and the caustic
comments of her mother-in-law enraged her.
So she wrote to an uncle in the Cold Coun-
try asking for her passage-money back. He
sent it, and while she was on her way home
the old chap died leaving £30,000. She be-
lieved herself to be his nearest surviving

deceased’s lawyers, who furnished her with

came to hand in quarterly instalments for
two years. Then the stream dried up, and
instead came a bundle of newspaper reports
showing that, as the result of litigation in
London, the remitter had been dispossessed of
her estate. Investigation had proved that she
was no blood relation of' the testator, but
merely an adopted niece, and a long-lost son
had turned up and found little difficulty in
making good his claim. Now the lady pro-
poses to return to Australia and resume
married life where she left it off. The hus-
band has taken legal advice about it, and
learned that his spouse yvill be perfectly within
her rights ih returning to his side. But he
is far from enthusiastic about the prospect;
indeed, his selection with stock is for sale,
and the advt. reads, “For quick and imme-
diate disposal, as Mr. is leaving the
country.”

“Carisbrook, Jr.”: “Titanus’s” yarn (B.
,5/7/’23) reminds me of an experience I had
on the Katherine-Darwin (N.T.) railway.
Not being a Government official, meat-
worker or wharf-laborex*, I tra-
velled second-class, and had as
companions two abos. who were
under police escort to Darwin.
The bobby in charge wanted to
travel first with some of his
fellow-officials, so he procured
several feet of stout chain, a
few padlocks and all the hand-
cuffs available. When he had
finished the abos. could barely
move, and by the time we
reached Pine Creek they were
all but done in. I don’t know
how they got on over the other
140 miles.
“The Rumpus”: ‘The final dramatic touch
to a divorce case was recently supplied in
the Perth railway goods-shed before a grin-
ning audience of porters. The ex-husband
was railing his personal belongings up-country.
It was a motley heap, insecurely packed,
and he was regarding it disconsolately,
when in stalked his quondam wife. From
out of a tub of effects she snatched a large
photograph, lifted her knee and broke the
exhibit in two. The . half containing himself
she threw disdainfully at him with the
words: “There’s another man alongside of
me now —I wouldn’t be seen in the same
picture with you!” He was too flabber-
gasted to answ T er.
X2X: It is a cardinal article of belief with
many biologists that the living organism is
entirely dependent on its environment for
any changes which may take place in its
structure. This seems to be supported by the
recently published
investigations of an
American anthropo-
metrical society.
The gist of the con-
clusions reached is
that the American
of the fifth, sixth
and seventh gen-
erations, especially
when there are few
alien strains in his
pedigree, is gradu-
ally acquiring the
physical character-
istics of the In-
dians whom he has
supplanted. The 1
most marked of
these characteris-
ti c s are high
cheek-bones, a pro-
minent and well-
bridged nose, and
straight, lank and
dark hair. Fur-
ther measurements
and indices of the
limbs and features
correspond closely
with those of mem-
bers of the various
Indian races.
T here must be
something in the
theory, but to carry
the hypothesis to
its logical conclu-
sion is not alto-
gether pleasant for
an Australian. In
a century or two
will our descen-
dants be exhibiting
some of the physi-
cal characteristics
which distinguish
Binghi?
“Sucre”: The house-visiting parson in
Australia sometimes gets unexpected rebuffs.
A zealous curate doing the Alexandria (Syd-
ney) rounds had his knock answered by a
nipper of six or eight. “Mother is suited
with a clergyman, thank you,” she said, and
shut the door.

“Schnorrer”: The growth of Sydney and
the growing value of city property may move
on the Great Synagogue, now standing in
Elizabeth-street. President S. S. Cohen told
the annual meeting the other day that the
Board of Management had received a hand-
some offer for the site, and he obtained the
consent of the congregation to open nego-
tiations if the would-be purchasers remain
in the same mind. Seeing that the Jew is
supposed not only to desist from Sabbath
work but to refrain from involving others in
it, a Synagogue in the city is not in the
best position. Darlinghurst, where the Jew-
ish Communal Hall is being erected, would
be more convenient as a central site, for a
big Hebrew population is located about there
MORE AND MORE AND MORE.
“When Jack and I are married Em going to
have three servants."
“You will probably have twenty-three, my
dear —but not all at once."
Newtown —sometimes referred to as Jew-
town —has a synagogue of its own. The
Elizabeth-street sanctuary superseded the
synagogue in Druitt-street, and Chief Rabbi
Dr. Hertz praised it as the finest Jewish
temple in the southern hemisphere.

THE ALMOND-TREES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Two sun-kissed almond-trees to-day
Are talking in the street;
The gentle words they have to say
Are seasonably sweet;
The merry petals blown astray
Fall kindly at my feet.
Each blossom has a note of cheer,
A bride-pink tender tone,
That tells me of the golden year
To springtime laughter grown.
The melody of change is near
When almond sweets are blown.
I pause to catch a whispered word
And raise my hat the while ;
Like the clear twitter of a bird
It sets my heart asmile ;
Old jarring thoughts by passion stirred
Those blossoms reconcile.
I weave a dream from cares aloof,
The warp of chastest Thought,
While resolutions in the woof
Shine golden, as they ought.
My dream, against all reason proof,
Is beautifully wrought.
And bright hopes banish dull despair,
As sunrays gladden gloom ;
No jot nor tittle do I care
How fate may mould my doom,
When subtle odors tell the air
Of almond-trees in bloom.
Amidst a thousand of their kind,
Not mewed in Melbourne’s street,
Their petals, borne upon the wind,
Might vainly brush my feet.
But here my singing soul and mind
Find almond beauty sweet.
VICTORIA.

“Azrim”: It isn’t only the inebriate
whose breath is liable to ignite(B. 30/8/’23).
I recall the case of a whiskered Cousin Jack
miner near Clunes (Vic.). He suffered
severely from heartburn and gaseous eructa-
tions, and one evening, as he was' lighting his
pipe, the escaping gas took fire and set the
old chap’s ziff ablaze. He had the presence
of mind to dip the flaming fuel into an adja-
cent water-butt. Next evening the same
thing happened again; and the local saw-
bones, after a careful examination of the
walking gasometer, averred that the cause
was a cancer of the pyloric end of the
stomach, which, by delaying digestion,
allowed green vegetables present to ferment
and produce inflammable gases, probably
methane.

“Alpha”: The other day a clerical gentle-
man on a visit to the Melbourne Uni. dis-
secting-room received an unpleasant jolt
when he was accidentally hit on the head by
a human heart, playfully propelled by a
medical student at a friend. . The medical
profs, are worried over the incident; it may
reopen a vexed question—can one lawfully
THE GENTLE SENTIMENTALIST.

and I could see it was breaking the

traffic in a dead body? Such law as. at
present exists on a rather gruesome subject
dates from a case heard in 1909. A woman
in M.L. gave birth to a still-born, two-
headed child. The medical attendant took
the body away, preserved it with spirits in
a bottle and kept it in his surgery. On his
death it was sold by auction to one Hoode-
ward for £4O. In course of time Doode-
ward’s son inherited the monstrosity and
proceeded to turn it to commercial account.
He took it about the country charging for
admission, and made money until he was
prosecuted and the “exhibit” confiscated. He
then brought an action for its recovery
against the Inspector of Police. The High
Court (Higgins, J., dissenting) held there
was no law forbidding the possession of the
dead body of a human being, and ordered
its return to the showman.
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.
MRS. SJMITH: "Mr. Coutts, our new curate. Mr. Contis is a Master of Lan-
guages, John.”
MR. SJMITH: "Master of Language.s? Pleased to meet you—l play golf, too.”
“Ex-Dig.” : Both the Repat. and the R.S.L.
have tried hard to get the soldier “bands”
off the streets of Sydney; but the game pays,
and so it goes on. A “stumpie” was recently
induced to leave a job at £4 15s. to become
collector for an unmusical organisation con-
sisting of one man and a French horn. The
musician is neither a returned man nor
maimed; but he secured the khaki bait for
his hook with a guaranteed £6 per week —
plus the pension, of course.

“Percy Pawnticket”: A chronically un-
employed acquaintance of mine, who cheer-
fully owns to a prejudice against work which
doesn’t suit him, and yet refuses specific
information about what sort of a job will
suit, explained to me how lie could get seven
meals a day in Sydney if he wanted them.
One of the places that enjoy his_ patronage
is a mission where the distribution of vic-
tuals is preceded by “revival” services, with
a final call upon those who feel that repen-
tance has come to them. The doors are
closed so that nobody can get in for the
food unless he comes early enough for the
service. Outside the hall the other night
there was a most indecorous scuffle amongst
some of the regular habitues, and a big red-
headed chap had to be hauled off another
man. “The cow!” he explained bitterly*.
“He won’t do his share to keep the joint
going! It was his turn to be saved to-
night and he shirked it.”
“Geebung”: The old salt’s saying, “The
man who harms an albatross harms him-
self,” has got a fresh fillip. The welfare
officer on the s.s. Sophocles, on its trip from
England to Australia —he was a man of
middle-age named McDonald, given to melan-
choly—shot an albatross five days after the
vessel left Capetown. Next morning the
man was found dead in his cabin with a
bullet wound in the head.

“Double Disc”: Re bayonet wounds.
While an inmate of No. 3 London General
Hospital, after the battle of Loos, I saw no
less than five Tommies there who were
recovering from the effects of Fritz’s work
with the cold steel. I don’t think “Dinki
Di” (B. 23/8/’23) would say the bayonet
was an obsolete weapon if he had ever seen
the Jocks in action. They used the weapon
with deadly effect. Inverness Copse and
Glencorse Wood, near Ypres, proved that.
In T l 7 the Scotties had a terrible experience
there of a Hun flammenwerfer attack. Those
that were not partly incinerated hopped into,
Fritz with the bayonet. The dead of the
flame-throwers were there to be seen by
all, and of those that I saw fully 80 p.c.
had been “done in” with the skewer. Eye-
witnesses agreed that as far as could be. seen
the attackers did not fire a shot, despite a
perfect barrage of Mauser-pistol bullets.
Any infantry officer of the Old Contemp-
tibles will tell what a large part the bayonet
played in the memorable days of ’l4. Not-
ably so with the Coldstream Guards in the
street fighting in the village of Landrecies.
“Jack M.”: Wonderful how quickly the
miracles of modern science begin to pail.
A few weeks ago a friend of mine made a
night-flight from London to Paris in one of
the new Handley-Page ’planes, which are
more up-to-date than anything else that
cleaves the air. When he returned I asked
him what sort of a flight he had. Tire-
some,” he replied. U I never could stand re-
vues.” In a wonderful sound-proof cabin,
flying at a hundred miles an hour, the music
of a revue played that night in a London
theatre and conveyed to him by a loud-
speaking wireless telephone had bored him
stiff! .

“Arabe”: “O’South” (B. 30/8/’23) seems
to think that in Vic., as in England, the
divorce law may still be abused by a vindic-
tive petitioner’s refusal to take the necessary
steps to have a decree nisi made absolute.
As a matter of fact, the Vic. Divorce rules
were amended in 1918, with the express
object of preventing such abuse. In that
year a rule was added requiring petitioner’s
solicitor to lodge in the office of the Pro-
thonotary, within 14 days from the pro-
nouncing of a decree nisi, the duly drawn-
up decree. The decree is then passed and
entered, and, at the expiration of three
months from the date it bears, is made abso-
lute by the l’rothonotary. In many cases
within my knowledge a petitioner’s failure to
have a decree nisi made absolute has been
due not to vindictiveness but to ignorance.
Many petitioners, having heard the decree
nisi pronounced by the Court, have assumed
that they have been free to re-marry, and
have done so. There were so many of
these bigamous marriages that six or seven
years ago Victoria found it necessary to
make them valid by Act of Parliament.

“ Jonic”: Astounding were the chances
some men would take in the pursuit of
“souvenirs.” After the second Pozieres
stunt (Mouquet Farm), while I was on an
observation-post, I sniped a German officer
in No Man’s Land. One of the lads, a noto-
rious souvenir-hunter, crawled out at great
risk of being shot, and, in Digger’s parlance,
“ratted” the deceased. Amongst. the “souvs.”
collected was a watch, but as it was minus
the key he went out again, and his efforts
being still unrewarded he actually rolled the
departed into our trench, a distance of about
40 yards, to make a more thorough search.
He had just satisfied himself that the watch-
key was non est when an officer came along
and sharply demanded what the man was
doing vrith a dead Fritz in the trench. ,1
dragged the poor bloke in from No Man’s
Land so that I could bury him,” came the
reply. And he did, in a shell-hole, still
cursing his luck.

“Iford”: Cremation lost—or should it be
gained? —a distinguished advocate in the
late Frederic Harrison, who left testamen-
tary directions that the frame which had
served him for 91 years should be consumed
by fire rather than by worms. With regard
to the subsequent ashes, however, which
some cremationists stipulate shall be scat-
tered to the winds of Heaven, Harrison, or
his executors, set a new precedent. 'Vnat
is left of the illustrious Positivist, reduced
into the smallest possible compass, will stand
in an urn in the ante-chapel of Wadham
College, Oxford, where the deceased was a
fellow and tutor nearly 70 years ago. Mor-
tuary urns of this sort are, of course, tai
older than Christian civilisation, but this
is probably the first instance, on record
where one has been installed in the scene
of a famous man’s earliest achievements.
In days to come rows of urns in Parliament
Houses and University halls, may displace
paintings or busts as mute witnesses to by-
gone eminence.

“Carisbrook «Tr.” : Wliile riding along .the
Flinders River (Q.) a couple of weeks ago,
I saw something glistening in. the sand
and on picking it up I found it to be a
double-headed half-crown. The date on
both sides was 1818 and the pictured king
was ‘'Georgius III.” Is two-up that o;d

“10-2-4”: Thus N.S.W: Governor David-
son on his dog:—
He has been arrested many times for vagrancy, as
he has a great partiality for the city streets. The
police on occasions have also brought back colorable
imitations of him.
It would be superfluous were all Bulletin
readers dog-experts to mention that the
errant animal is a Scotch terrier. These
long-nosed, bandy-legged little creatures are
the gossips of the dog-world, and, as in the
case of certain women, their trouble gets
worse as they grow older. An Aberdonian
of eight or nine cannot be said to be. the
property of anyone: his life is spent in a
round of visits to perhaps a dozen selected
households where the food is good and the
welcome warm. Some dogs would find it
difficult to bring off this imposition, but
Aberdeens are popular everywhere on
account of their ingratiating manners; and
in Australia they have the additional ad-
vantages of being rare, and of figuring in a
famous whisky advt. If N.S.W.’s popular
Governor wants a dog all to himself he
should get- an Irish terrier.. The ginger
animal is as unsociable ,as his rusty-haired
relative is gregarious, and as the years pass
the complaints of inoffensive callers who
have had their garments rent by a flying
blonde streak picked out with white fangs
OH, QUITE!
“Am I the only girl you’ve ever kissed?”

grow monotonous. Perhaps the most faith-
ful and peaceful of dogs all round is the
mastiff. But how many can afford to feed
a mastiff these days?
THINKING OVER IT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I was thinking of buying a car; so I tackled a friend .
Who was wonderful wise in mechanics. “Oh, <
well,” replied he,
• If you’re out to get hold of a car there are good 1
’uns no end;
There’s the Lanchester, Rolls-Royce an’ Sunbeam —
an’ toppers all three.
'“There’s the Daimler, an’ Austin, an’ Hillman, an’ j
Humber, an’ Guy;
The Crossley, the Buckingham, Crouch, an’ Corona,
an’ Gwynne;
The Jewel, an’ Jowett, an’ Chambers” “Hold on
for a second!” said I;
“All good ones?” “Yes, all of ’em good ’uns,”
said he with a grin.
“An’ then there’s the Cluley, an’ Lewis, the Alvis,
A.C., an’ Argyll,
The Triumph, an’ Turner, an’ Phoenix, the Belsize,
an’ Bean,
An’ Calthorpe”—-- “No doubt!” I broke in; “but
hold on for a while!”
The earth was beginning to rock, and I felt a bit
green.
“The Whitlock, an’ Rob Roy, an’ Riley, the Napier,
Reliance, an’ Rhode,
The Stoneleigh, the Albert, the Vulcan” I
nodded my head and was dumb —
“The Calcott, the Swift, an’ the Talbot”—as onward
his eloquence flowed
I hoped that my car when I got it would run with
as cheery a hum.
“There’s the Galloway, too,” he went on, “an’ the
■ Ensign, an’ Singer, an’ Seal;
There’s also, the Ruston, an’ Rover, McKenzie, Mag-
netic, an’ Star”
But here with my head like a whirlpool I turned on
my heel
And left him, to cool myself down ’ere I purchased
a car.

When President of the Vic. Uppah Cham-
bah, from ’7O till ’B4, S’William Fancourt
Mitchell, father of the K.C. who leads the
Melbourne Bar, invested in a wig and silk
gown, which have been handed down, at his
request, to his successors. Frank Clarke,
the latest to occupy the chair, found the

while pretending to take life seriously at Ox-
ford, after he had left Scotch College, Mel-
bourne, Clarke studied law, but didn’t go
through with his course. He is thus only half
a lawyer, whereas his three predecessors —■
Wrixon, Davies and Manifold—were all
fully fledged.
“Coree” (Malay States) : _ The Bulle-
tin’s contributor “Feng Shui” recently re-
called that Captain Francis Light, the father
of “the founder of Adelaide,” was the founder
of Penang. Francis Light had been the Brit-
ish representative in purchasing Penang (or
more correctly Prince of Wales Island), and
was sent with a small fleet to found a trad-
ing- and refitting-post. He was allowed to
engage in private trade, and joined with
another shellback, Captain James Scott.
After his death the family dropped out of
Penang history, until his grandson, a nephew
of Colonel Light, Robert Rollo Light, ap-
peared as a shipchandler and general trader.
He was succeeded by his son, Francis Light,
who is survived by his widow. She is still
living, the last, I believe, of the family in
Penang. Another relative, a great grand-
niece of the founder, an old lady of 83, is
however, living in Singapore. J. C. Pas-
qual, who hopes to publish a history of
Malaya shortly, is a descendant of some of
the first settlers and related by marriage to
a branch of the Light family.

W. and T. Pope is one of the oldest law
firms in Adelaide; but Tom Pope retired to
England several years ago, and William
died last week after a long illness. The firm
is now carried on by nephews,, for botn
brothers were childless. They did not go
into court much, but earned general confi-
dence in the management of estates. Wil-
liam was a broad-minded man. Always a
shining light in the Anglican synod of S.A
he had an eye to sport as well, and was at
one time president of the Hunt Club; also, he
took all the local honors in Masonry. He
died on his 78th birthday.
While Maoriland has been jubilating over
a great engineering feat in the Otira tunnel,
the completion of the greatest aerial railway
in the world —the steel ropeway across the
Colombian Andes in South America—is due
to the engineering skill of a Maorilander,
James Fergusson Lindsay, “Don Jamie’
constructed many mono-railways in Spain
prior to tackling the big South American
job. His father was a schoolmaster m
Oamaru, where he was born and educated
and acquired his first thirst for engineering.
Another ex-Digger has turned up at the
N.S.W. Bar —Peter Gallagher. An empty
coat-sleeve is a memorial of his war service.
When the “cease fire” sounded for him lie
came back to his old job on the reporting
staff of the Supreme Court, and used it as a
stepping-stone to Bar practice.
By taking the Presidency of Vic.’s Dreary
House, Frank Clarke forfeited £450 a year
—the difference between his Minister’s pay
of £l2OO a year and the £750 which goes
with the chair. Maybe it was “safety first”
with him, seeing that the Lawson team, as
now constituted, is on its last legs. He
should make a good President, but one who
can do such good campaigning as he did to
get the job should be on the floor of the
House.
Died at Elsternwick (Vic.) recently, Dr.
Thomas Barrow Birchall. He was a Lan-
cashire man, got his degree at Glasgow, and
came to Australia in 1887 when he was 36.
His front name came from Thomas Barrow,
one of Romney’s disciples, who was his
multiple-great-uncle. In the doctor’s case
the book-germ bit deep, and he didn’t bother
much about anything else than the collecting
of a library capable of making the rival book-
worm weep tears of blood. He was a fami-
liar figure at the Shakspeare and Dickens
Societies, and left many an umbrella at the
Public Library.
Gone prospecting in the fields Above,
Paddy Molloy, of Atherton, and Tom Batche-
lor, of Mareeba (N.Q.). Molloy was the
discoverer of the one-time rich copper lode
in the mountain that now bears his name
and divides the Mossman and the Cairns-
Mareeba railways. He was one of the early
prospectors of the Cairns hinterland, but,
though well in the van on several good gold
finds, nothing big came his way until, hunt-
ing for gold, he came across the copper seam
in a pothole at the mount. Laughing at
Paddy’s find, his mate refused to waste
any more time on the field, and left. Ot
late years cattle-raising and farming at
Tolga provided Molloy with a large, well-
buttered crust. Originally a carpenter,
hailing from Hampstead (Eng.), Batchelor
as a young man worked for a while at his
trade in Sydney; then the gold lure took
him north, and the early Croydon rush found
him well in the picture. A good claim, the
Homeward Bound, provided him with two
trips to the Cold Country. Later, he sold
out and managed the Content block of mines
for F. Cuthbert, “the Croydon King.” After
26 years on the field he gave up mining and
resumed his old trade at Mareeba.
Dead at 76, Alfred William Blaxland,
eldest son of Charles Blaxland, and grand-
son of Gregory Blaxland, who, with Law-
son and Wentworth, found a way over the
Blue Mountains in 1813. His widow is a
daughter of the late Archdeacon Greenway,
and grand-daughter of the Macquarie-era
architect Greenway, many of whose build-
ings still stand.
I-I. B. Thompson learned his business,
which was to know everything, about glass,
in Melbourne, and added to his experience
in European and American factories; but
for two decades he had been in Adelaide,
where he died the other day. He built up
the big firm of Thompson and Harvey, and
was at one time president of S.A. Chamber
of Commerce.
W. M. Hodgman, who went out to menin-
gitis in Tas. the other day, at 47, was ad-
mitted to the local Bar in 1902. As
there were no friendly pursestrings at his
command, he had a couple of uncomfortable
years. Then he joined N. K. Ewing, who
liow wears a judge’s horsehair, and soon at-
tracted notice as an advocate. On Ewing’s
elevation Hodgman went into partnership
with C. S. Page and R. Seager, and a very
substantial practice was built up.
“The Patriarch” : Dr. Cruppe, the retiring
Bish. of Rabaul, now in Sydney, has spent
34 of his 73 years in the land of malaria.
He leaves behind him 116 schools, 18 orphan-
ages and a handsome cathedral. His suc-
cessor, Bish. Vesters, has a nice little hand-
ful of 20,000 native R.C.’s to keep on the
narrow path. But, judging, by his genial
grin, he doesn’t seem to mind—maybe be-
cause Kensington (N.S.W.), the headquar-
ters of the mission, is turning out apostolic
material equal to the best products of the
old schools on the other side.
“8.J.” (from the edge of North Rhodesia) :
Arnold Weinholt, of Queensland, blew into my
camp a few days ago looking for lions. He was
just too late. Six of them had paid me a visit a
few nights before and given me a bad midnight
hour or two. Before I could drive them off they had
killed my two best trek bullocks. Weinholt was
quite grieved to learn that I had strychnined the
whole six, and had not left one or two for him
to go on with! Lions are gll he wants; he has
no time or use for “trophies” gained from defence-
less animals. He has been chewed up once in this
district by a lion, but that has only made him
keener.
“T. 0.1.”: The late J. G. Griffin (B.
30/S/’23), in the interest of protection for
native industries, opposed Henry Parkes, J.
F Burns and J. F. Cullen ,at St. Leonards
at the general election of 1889, and was de-
feated. But he polled 1057 votes—which was
pretty good for a Protectionist in an avowedly
Freetrade constituency.
“Alastor”: Frank Cooper, M.L.A., who
has exposed the bad jobs turned out at the
Ipswich workshops, is Labor’s best debater
in the Bananaldnd Parliament. He was once
secretary to an Anglican archbishop, and
for many years he has been running a Labor
weekly in Ipswich. • He is a fluent talker
with a turn for repartee that is rare among
politicians to-day. In the ballot for Assis-
tant-Home Secretary, Frank Brennan got
in one ahead of Cooper, but the latter is
tipped as a certainty for the next Cabinet
vacancy.
“Surat”: The late Mrs. Ellen Ross (B.
23/'B/'23) may have been the first white
woman to land at Townsville (Q.), but I
believe there were white women on the Bur-
dekin before her day. The late E. S. Antiil
went up there about 1858. Returning to
N. S. Wales he again set out from Picton
with his young wife, three small children,
three women servants and three men,
landed at Port Denison (near Bowen), and
took up land on the Burdekin. This was m
1861. He called the place Jarvisfield, and
another child was born to Mrs. Antill there.
The venture was cattle-raising, but the abos.
did most of the raising, and after three
strenuous and anxious years the party gave
up the enterprise. On one occasion the
blacks attacked the homestead when all the
men were away mustering. I think it was
on one of these trips that E. S. Antill dis-
covered Jimmy Morrell, the white mau
credited with having been with the blacks
for 20 years. Of those mentioned I know
that Mrs. Antill and three of the four child-
ren are still alive. One of the latter is my
mother, and the eldest in our family is near-
ing 50 years.
Just commenced final leave from the
N.S.W. Public Works Department, S. M.
Cummins, Supervising Engineer at Goulburn
since 1920. He did good work in the ’nineties
in the Wilcannia district, making the dry
'■'retches tramcable for stock. His first big
job was the Mount
Victoria - Jenolan
Caves road, and he
had as second in
command Ryan,
now M.L.C., of the
Lithgow Mercury,
then lately arrived
fro m Maoriland.
There was a strike
on that job, and
the two,, holding
the keys of the hut
in which was the
only tucker for
miles, came out on
top. Bad health
forces him out of
the service four
years before the re-
tiring age, which
makes him 61.
Mr. Justice
McARTHUR, of
the Vic. Supreme
Court.
C. W. Babbage, the eldest son of the eldest
son of the mathematician who invented a
once-famed calculating-machine, recently
passed out at Wanganui (M.L.). He was
82, had been surveyor, miner and farmer,
and was always keen on science and
philosophy.
Frank Lundie, the Adelaide Labor man
with the rough tongue, isn’t improving. Four
members of the City Council on the Corpora-
tion Wages Board have just resigned as a
protest against his language. They reported
that he had called them “blood-suckers who
would skin a louse for its hide,” and had
also said (speaking for the employees) :
“There is no honesty on that side of the
table” —with adjectives represented in the
report by blanks. Lundie owned up to the
louse, but said the rest was merely part of an
exchange of asperities. The Council, how-
ever, passed a motion of “emphatic protest,”
and full confidence in the four who have re-
signed. Lundie got his start as a Labor
leader in the West Darling, where he assisted
Jack Barnes, afterwards Senator. But he
didn’t learn those methods from him.
“Schnorrer” : Both Melbourne's new Jew-
ish ministers had to earn their own scholar-
ships and make their way to the ’Varsity,
with breaks in study to earn money. Mestel
owns an M.A ; Rabbi Brodie is B.A. and
B.Litt. Brodie spent two years or more at the
war as a chaplain, so he has done well to
gather those degrees and his Rabbinical
diploma at 27. lie is unmarried, but will be
expected to alter that, since the wise Jew-
ish custom, which favors early marriage in
any case, insists upon ministers knowing the
sobering influence of a wife. There was re-
cently a row in a big congregation in Hol-
land over just that. A rabbi had been
appointed on an agreement to marry within
12 months. He managed to get several re-
prieves, but finally the ultimatum was
delivered: Get married or get out. His
synagogue committee even went to the length
of giving him a choice between three eligible
ladies. With no escape left he took the
plunge with one of them.
Hugh McKenzie, now approaching his
90th year, is one of the oldest of retired Vic.
civil servants. He entered the Customs ser-
vice in the very first ’fifties, and with his
boat’s crew did pioneer work among the vast
number of ships from all parts of the world
assembled in Hobson’s Bay in the “gold
days.” One of his reminiscences is connected
with the murder of Inspector-General John
Price at Williamstown breakwater in March,
1857. That day, while McKenzie was on
his verandah, town-surveyor Bull ran past
with a huge blunderbuss, saying that the con-
victs had broken loose and would probably
murder everyone they came across. McKen-
zie, seizing the only weapons he could find, an
old duck gun without a ramrod, and a Man-
ila sword-stick, followed his friend, and on
their way to Gellibrand’s Point met a party
conveying the much-mangled Price in a wheel-
barrow to the surgery of Dr. Wilkins, where
he died a few hours later.
THE DISCARDED PHANTOM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
No woman lives to vie with her I dreamed of long
ago
On whom no scandal cast a slur, who had no
jealous foe
To drop the gentle hints that bear a tinge of
venomed truth;
She was a “dream” beyond compare, that vision of
my youth.
The girls 1 met in mortal form were never free
from stain:
They oft betrayed a temper warm, or gave their
parents pain;
They all, of course, were wondrous sweet, equipped
with siren tongue.
One word would bring me to their feet when I was
very young.
But though I worshipped for awhile those goddesses
of flesh,
From each respective glance and smile I turned to
something fresh,
And still was haunted in my dreams by one, devoid
of fault,
Who fed me with platonic themes, sans mustard,
pepper, salt.
I wonder was I wiser then, or am I wiser grown
Since, like a lot of other men, allegiance I disown
To pure ideals of the mind —or, maybe, of the soul ■
Do I in morals lag behind while nearing Nature’s
goal?
For good or bad the angel maid who had no human
peer—
The maid in Innocence arrayed—has fled my mental
sphere.
As far as I’m concerned the joys of make-believe are
gone;
I leave them to the modern boys who now are com-
ing on.
O Woman, in our hours of ease, expensive, pert
and bold,
Whose manner, when it feigns to freeze, diffuses heat,
not cold,
Ido protest you could and should my sordid self
uplift; -
Yet when you are too good I would not have you
at a gift.
victoria.

“Two Seas”: “Jimmy Possum’s” method
of catching his unruly prads (B. 16/'B/’23) reminds
me of another recipe invented by a Sydneysider
HE HAD HIS SOCIAL POSITION TO CONSIDER.
JACKEROO: “We’ve got a job for you at Cumbalong, Boon. You
and the missus and kids can camp in the shed."
BOOM: “No good to this feller, boss, to leave his house to camp in
a piarry shed.”
employed by a way-back neighbor of mine. The
cocky took this smart youth with him to help catch
a moke which he always had to start snaring a day
before he wanted to use him. After the pursuit
had lasted an hour or two the assistant was missing;
and, as the paddock was almost cleared, Cocky
couldn’t make out where he had" got to. He yelled
for 10 minutes before he saw a head poke cautiously
out from a huge hollow log and remark, , “Hush!
Don’t make a noise, boss, and I’ll get ’im.’ But
what the blazes are you doing there?” yelled Cocky,
as he hauled him out by the ear. “I was trying to
catch your flamin’ ’orse for you,” retorted the city
youth. “I jerried that ’e always passed along this
track close to the end of the log, and I ’id in it so
as to catch the blankard by the foot as he went
by and chuck ’im on ’is snout.
“Jay Hef”: There’s nothing sensational
about a cow having one calf and then milking on for
the term of her natural life —it’s as common as
divorce among war brides. I know of one that
calved in 1914 and was milked for two seasons,
but refused to be dried off. Then one morning a
newly-arrived calf was found wandering among the
herd, and the perpetual milker started licking him.
Next thing he was enthusiastically on the booze,
much to the contentment of the lady. At first
the calf was marked for the hatchet, but it was
agreed that if the cow would take to him they
should he turned out together. She did, and
in six months came home with a bonzer vealer.
He was taken off, and another young one brought
along—and Strawberry took to the new-comer like
a Plunkett nurse. She is now rearing her ninth
foster-child and still going strong.
* * * *
“F.H.R.”: “Whackey’s” auctioneer (B.
9/8/’23) reminds me of old Ned Taylor, who owned
Pretty Plains, near Lucknow (N.S.W.). At 60 he
was still the master of any horse. He sent his
son Arthur and me out one morning to run in the
young ones, and aftelr he had picked out a fine
brown colt that had never had a halter on we left
him in the yard. After dinner I was having five
minutes on the bunk, when I heard buggy wheels.
Jumping up, I saw old Ned driving that colt round
the woodheap. He took him round it a few times,
and then wheeled out on to the racecourse near by.
The neddy seemed quiet enough when brought back,
but a bit nervous. The Orange stock inspector
came out next day to have a look at the colt, and
after a drive with Ned bought him. How did the
old chap do it? Many of us youngsters would have
given our best girl to know.
* * * *
“The Magpie”: Recent references to
Binghi’s dogs acting as doctors remind me that one
night in Broome (W.A.) our two abos. were enter-
taining visitors, and, it being the “lay-up” season, they
had managed to get some grog. The inevitable fight hap-
pened, and one big buck had his head split open with
a “tommy-chopper.” Next morning I saw the great
gap in his cranium, and felt sure he was doomed; but
at sunset that day a strange native woman from the
interior arrived and began to lick the awful fester-
ing matter. She was in the compound for several
days and the wound healed up clean.
“Pick”: With a notion that they pro-
mote healthiness among sheep, some squatters nowa-
days keep herds of goats on their runs. AVe had: cut
out the woollies on Havilah station (N.S.W.) when
a yarding of Angoras was turned in on us. We hated
to handle the struggling, baa-ing stinkers, but we had
had a fair spin at Havilah, so we agreed to give
them a two hours’ run. It was a regular rough-up,
but within time the last had been spilled down the
chutes. When the board overseer went below to
count out the pens, he found that the whole pei-
fumery had scrambled over the fences and vanished
beyond the horizon. The hair was already in the
bales, and a re-muster didn’t fit in with our haste
to get paid and away, so the boss decided to leave
it to each barber to estimate how many he had
peeled. Then it was that all shearing tallies of the
past, present and future were put in the shade.
* * * *
“Valamac”: The push-bike, which “Trev-
dee” mentions (B. 2/8/’23) as being extensively
used for mustering i»
Westralia, is not the
horse’s only rival. Mus*
tering-time on many Q.
and N.S.W. sheep-sta-
tions sees every motor-
car on the place pressed
into service. With the
aid of a couple of
sheep-dogs a car can
cover as much country
as a horse, and it has
the advantage of being
easily converted into a
travelling hospital for
Stragglers. Boundary-
riding is the push
bike’s long suit, there
being in most cases a
good track alongside
the fence. One old
boundary-rider that I
k 1 no w covers many
miles of fence every
day per bike. He keeps
a horse, but rides him
only when on a visit to
the nearest pub, 20
miles away. That’s
one big thing in favor
of the prad. He’ll take
you home safely as long
as you can stick to the saddle.
“The Overlander”: About 12ft. down a
well, on one of its granite sides, a swallow built
her nest and raised two chicks. Thinking she had
miscalculated the chances of her ever seeing her
brood on the wing, I awaited developments, fully
expecting that the youngsters would find a watery
grave 10ft. or so below the nest. The lady’s
instinct, however, was O.K. No pussy or reptile
had a hope of getting at her nippers, and when I
saw them last mother was teaching ’em gliding
stunts in mid-air. Now, I’m; wondering from how
far down can a baby swallow, make its way out of
a well, with no chance of resting on the side because
of its smoothness, nor on the bottom because of
'ts wetness.
“Kenbir”: I nominate Nudgee, of the
Bloomfield River blacks, as the heftiest nig. in
Bananaland. He stands 6ft. lOin. and is as strong
as a lion. He can step 100yds. with a log of
wood weighing 6cwt. His greatest pal on many
a walkabout is Bung, of the same tribe —a hideous,
contorted hunchback with one eye and a leg four
inches shorter than its fellow. This monstrosity’s
ONE FOR SHORTY.
“Bill an’ me can’t quite make up our minds about you, Shorty.
“ ’Ow so?”
“Whether you're a blinkin’ idiot or a nacheral-born fool.”
“Oh, I’m something between the two.”
only decent accomplishment is spear-making, and
some of his best workmanship is now in the Ken-
dall collection.
“B. Wise” : While driving four-in-hand 70
miles to the Wilcannia (N.S.W.) Show in 1912,
accompanied by a lady from a neighboring station,
the near-side leader shied and ran a culvert guide-
post between himself and the other leader. The
post struck the leading bars and broke the coupling
to the pole ; the leading reins pulled me out over the
dashboard, and I found myself between the near-side
poler’s hind legs. I rolled out somehow, to find my
companion hanging on to the polers, while the
leaders were making even time for the bank of the
Darling. They eventually galloped in a wide circle
and came back straight for the buggy, and when
within 10 yards of us tried to go on opposite sides
of a big river-gum, with the result that the off-
sider hit it head-on and dropped with a broken neck.
The other freed himself from his dead mate and
made off again through the timber. About half an
hour afterwards I caught him standing trembling at
the top of a high river-bank without a vestige of
harness. Picking up what I could find I spent
another hour patching up, and we eventually reached
Wilcannia with a unicorn team. Next day I won
first prize for best buggy pair at the Show, and my
remaining leader was driven in the winning team
in the unicorn event with two Buckanbe-station
horses.
*.'***
“Cobba Cobba”: Tell “W.” (B. 2/8/’23)
that long before they tasted the flesh of white men
the Papuan heathens knew all the points, good and
bad, about pawpaws. Old men taken prisoners in
tribal fights always knew what to expect when paw-
paw began to figure on the menu. It fattens and
puts new, tender meat on to old bones.
“Pick” sees some Australians in a hurry:
In their schemes for escape when chased by dogs,
bush animals adopt varying tactics. The kangaroo
when fresh can make good pace on rising ground, but
he can quadruple the rate when heading downhill.
He, therefore, when pursued first makes up the slopes,
but turns immediately on finding himself closely
pressed, and his surprising accession of speed usually
throws the dogs off the hunt. Wallabies, always found
on rocky hillsides, spring extraordinary distances from
ledge to ledge, invariably going parallel with the
mountain base. The rough going soon sickens any
but the most determined dog. When, however, Wally
hears the panting horror at his tail he bounds eight
or ten feet straight upwards, allowing the dog to pass
under him, and is far rearward before his discomfited
enemy can pull up and turn. Wallaroos seek safety
by bounding over prickly-bush thickets, or, for choice,
across boggy ground. They are sluggish and heavy
in their usual gait, but in flight will cross a swamp
or shaking bog scarcely leaving a toe-print behind
them. If caught they are the gamest fighters of the
marsupial tribes, and will renew their flight after
giving a dog the handling of his life. Paddy-melons,
when danger threatens, dart beneath logs, bracken or
matted brush-shrubs, beyond which they crouch until
further disturbed; then they streak back along their
tracks and soon have their yapping tormentors be-
wildered. Rock-wallabies are the champion acrobats
of their kind. They will, jump over the brow of the
nearest precipice when dog or gunman appears, and,
though the cliff-face may seem polished smooth, each
successive leap always finds a foothold that leads to
safety in some crevice below.
“Gregor”: “Amboina’s” reference (B.
16/8/'23) to the playful Papuan habit of screwing a
man’s head around until it is as near back-to-front
as possible, recalls that that is a mild proceeding
compared with what some of the devils of the interior
have been capable of. A few years ago a police boy
was captured by some natives near the Dutch border,
in the district of Eitape, and after a three-days’
session of unspeakable
pleasantries, a number
of 6in. splinters of dry
wood were struck into
his flesh and set alight.
Among many of the
cannibal communities
prisoners were always
tortured before being
eaten. One method was
to pull out the nails
of the fingers and toes,
and another to break
every bone in the body
with a short club.
Then the system of
eating the prisoner
practically alive was a
cheerful form of devil-
ishness. This consisted
of cutting off an arm
or a leg, and then
checking the resultant
haemorrhage by tying
up the severed veins
and arteries betwteen
two bamboo splinters
and plastering the
stump with mu*'. In
this way a man could
be made to supply
fresh meat for several
days until the combined
shock and exhaustion
finished him. This
“eating alive” has
happened in isolated
parts of the interior
within the past five
or six years, and down
to about 20 years ago
cases were fairly fre-
quent. A number of
white men were tor-
tured and eaten in the
early days, and right
up till comparatively
recent times there were
prospectors, recruiters, paradise-bird hunters and
others who never went without a handy little bit of
sudden death in the shape of a tube of potassium
cyanide on their persons.
* * * *
“Cobba Cobba”: Tell “Ringer” (B.
26/7/’23) that George Gilmour was the acknowledged
leader of the Ragged Thirteen. Probably the first
white party, they were undoubtedly the toughest
that went overland from the Gulf (N.Q.) into AVes-
tralia. Leaving Queensland with nothing, they had
about 70-head of nice stock-horses for sale when they
struck Kimberley (AA r .A.). George was the first pro-
spector of the Gilmour Group in the Peninsula, and
did his bit in the European mix-up.
“Almurta”: I knew one man from S. Aus.,
named Sandy Myrtle (Alexander McDonald), who
was a member of the Ragged Thirteen. He was well
knijwn in the State between Beltana and Alice Springs
for over 40 years. 1 reckon he would be captain,
speaker and chairman of committees of the Thirteen,
NO LAGGARD.
SHOP FOREMAN: “You ain't one of them
blokes toot drops their tools and scoots
as soon as knock-off blows, are you?"
LILYWHITE : “Not me. Why, I often have
to wait five minutes after I put me tools
away before the whistle goes."
as he was a hard citizen, and at various times in the
nor’-west of S. Aus. was stockman, station-manager,
trainer, camel teamster, bumboat man, storekeeper
and publican. Sandy got very stout, and when I sa\\
him seven years ago he looked to be between 18 an
20 stone. He lived hard, and I’m sure he died hard.
He went out about three years ago in Adelaide.

DEAD TREES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Mid broken timber, long dead and rotten,
In death still stately, in ruin grand,
By birds forsaken, by bees forgotten,
The tall trees stand.
Green life was theirs through radiant summers,
Ere man came hither to work them woe,
With green leaves greeting as welcome comers
All winds that blow.
Grass-blade and bracken and fern they shaded,
On them the dews of the morning shone;
The death-ring round them, they greyed and faded,
And died anon.
Great nature sent them rich saps to thicken
Their columns, graceful and smooth and tall;
Behold how they stand dry-veined, death-stricken,
And doomed to fall!
For more than their slayer’s years they flourished,
Unlike their slayer, untouched by grief,
While kind suns warmed them, and good soil nourished
Live limb and leaf.
The slayer slew them; but who knows whether
’Twas mindless wood that he doomed to die?
Who knows, as they breathed in the dark together,
With no man nigh
What high thoughts, known not to us, they cherished,
What wonders spacious, and dreams sublime?
What scenes they visioned of days that perished
Far back in Time?

NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.
“I ’eard up mine to-day, Jennifer, that there’s some growlin’ with
the cochics ’bout the price of wheat goin’ down.”
“Price of wheat don’t make no difference to we, William John;
I do buy all our bread.”
“Roughie”: While out ’fboing we saw a
big flock of crows fluttering near a fence. We went
over to see what the argument was about, and the
flock left —bar one, which was hanging on the barb-
wire. It was still alive, and was suspended from a
barb which had pierced its tongue. Was it murder,
suicide or accident —or were the other crows detailed
off to execute him for some law he had broken?
NOW, COULD FOCII HAVE DONE IT?
COMPULSORY-TRAINING OFFICER: “Stand at attention when addressing an officer.”
CADET: “ Y-yus; hut supposin’ someone has pinched your belt, an’ you’ve got to hold
your trousers up?”
“Barcoo”: Tropical Bananaland knows
how to be cold too. A while back, close to Auga-
thella, on the Warrego (S.-W. Ql), 18.000 wethers
belonging to F. Hughes and Co., Sydney, were
camped for the night en route to Charleville on
their way to N.S.W. They were rather low in
condition owing to the drought, and had just been
relieved of their overcoats at the Blackall Shearing
Co.’s shed. It turned
out a night of icy
wind and drizzling
rain, and at daylight
•5000 were dead. Not far
away, the same night,
2000 just-shorn sheep
were held in a yard at
the shed, and when the
shepherds came in the
morning to take them
away to an out-station,
the whole flock was
mutton. One Septem-
ber, in the middle
’nineties, Central Ban-
analand was struck by
just such another Ant-
arctic blast, and very
big losses were reported
from all stations then
shearing. Rockwood,
on the Landsborough
River, belonging to
Stewart Bros, and Mc-
Caughey, had 30,000
just-shorn maiden ewes
in the shorn-sheep pad-
dock, and the freezing
wind drove the shiver-
ing, perishing jum-
bucks up against the
wire fences, where
they piled themselves
on top of one another
till they were toppling
into the adjoining pad-
docks. At daylight
next morning 20,000
out of the 30,000 were
dead. Twenty years
afterwards their bleach-
ing bones were visible,
mixed with the soil
along this fence, on
the coach route lead-
ing to the head sta-
tion. The same night,
Kensington Downs, out-
side of Muttaburra, lost 8000 out of 15,000 freshly-
shorn two-tooth wethers.

“Two Seas”: The opinion of “Monaro” (B.
9/S/’23) that the dingo “longs for human companion-
ship” should raise a grin from the Queensland
border to Cape York. The one that his friend saw
near Bowral (N.S.W.) must have been some mon-
gvel deserted by a Sydney week-end tourist, and the
fact that when it was coaxed to sleep at the door
of a tent it travelled the' last few yards “almost
on its back,” proves to a bushman that the poor,
broken-spirited mongrel had been used to getting
more kicks than tucker. Anyone familiar with the
habits of the beast knows that it would be easier
to coax a tiger into a mouse-trap than to induce a
pure dingo to come to heel and camp as described
by “Monaro.” The charge of shot that put his
animal out of his misery was correctly addressed
all right. Unfortunately for my pocket, I have had
a deal of experience of the real Simon Pure who
preys on our sheep. Once I took a sheep slut who
had been advertising “with view to mat.,” and
tethered her at the foot of a range favored by dingoes
who were taking heavy toll of our jumbucks. It was
a clear moonlight night, and I hoped to draw a
bead on one with my Winchester. But I fell asleep
on my watch, and the result was that, in due
course, my livestock was increased by five half-
bred dingo pups. I tried my best to civilise the
quietest of the batch, which we decided to rear;
but even when feeding it on the chain the brute
preferred to sample me rather than the meat offered
it. Eventually, I had to destroy it in the interests
of “T. 5.,” junior, whose chubby legs offered an
irresistible invitation to the savage brute to indulge
his “longing for humankind.”
* * * *
“Ringer”: Here are some bush records I
know of. Killing and dressing a goat in 11 minutes;
shoeing a horse under five minutes; two brothers
broke in, handed over and were paid for 23 horses
in one week; Billy Thomas poisoned 180 dingoes
in one night, on the Hergott-Birdsville (Q.) road (at
a dollar a- pop this was good fishing) ; a new-chum
overseer drenching lambs poisoned all of the 600
he treated —the dose he gave each lamb was enough
to finish a bullock. And my mate and I lived every-
day of three weeks on rice and tea alone, and at
night we fed every blanky mosquito in South-Western
Bananaland.
* * * *
“Yarrum”: The Murray cod did not, as is
generally supposed, get its name from the big
river. It was so called after Terence Aubrey Murray,
one-time N.S.W. Speaker and then President of the
I.eg, Council, who first turned it loose in Australia.
The first fish were taken from Goulburn to Lake
George, and liberated near Currandooley. The
little things were in an immensei cask, and my
uncle, who told me all about it, attended to the
carting. Later on, babies from the lake. were put
into the Queanbeyan, a tributary of the Murrurn-
bidgee, and that’s how they got to the Murray.
Still later, they navigated the Darling and its many
tributaries, and they are now over all parts of the
State that are wet enough to have them.
“Tauwarra”: A much-travelled big-game
hunter once visited Port Moresby (Papua), but the
only sport offering was a bit of wild-duck shooting
in the swamps a few miles behind the town. He got
hold of a brown guide, and in labored pidgin-English
confided to him that he liked a spice of danger with
his sport, and that ducks, however wild, didn’t make
for much excitement. Brown Brother listened in
bewildered silence till at last the light of compre-
hension dawned. “I savee, taubada!” he beamed. “I
savee ! I t’ink this good fashion you come cut ’long
me. Las’ time I go look out ducky-duck, ’long my
fader, I shoot him ’long belly b’long him!”
* * * *
"R.R.L.”: Re “M.S.” and “Ringer” (B.
16/8/’23) on precocious equine flappers. Years ago i
visited a station up north, and while I was there a
pet mare had a foal. Out of compliment to their
guest the family named the baby Ruby. Three years
later Ruby was a grandmother.
“Splinter”: “Kenbir” (B. 26/7/’23) and
his load-carrying nigger prompts me to record the
recent death of John Staunton, of the Queanbeyan
(N.S.W.) district. He lived 33 miles from town in
the heart of the mountains, and often walked to
town and returned with a bag of sugar or flour
on his shoulder. Evidently his son is of the same
type—l saw him bend a four-inch nail with his fingers
with less trouble than the average man would have
to bend a piece of No. 10 wire. 1 also saw him
push a Ford, with four heavy passengers aboard, up
a grade of about 1 in 10 for a distance of approxi-
mately 15 feet, and no weakling could do that.
* ■» * *
“255”: “5690” (B. 12/7/’23) is not quite
up to date about a white crow being owned by a
publican at Ft. Lincoln (S.A.). The bird was
caught in a rabbit-trap, and, minus one leg, it lived
for 15 years mostly on fresh eggs (which it would
break open itself) and raw meat. The publican was
offered £l5 for it—-and slipped when he didn't
take it, for as soon as he took the crow with him
over the border into Vic. it died. That was last
year. I know, because I was at the funeral.
* * * *
“Billy Brolga”: Has any Abo. ever tried
to catch a wild duckling a few days old in the
water? If he has, I guess he learned something.
I’ve tried numbers of times, but only once did I
succeed, and then it was a fluke. Three of us were
chasing a batch of the little beauties in a shallow,
circular saltpan little better than a chain in
diameter. We thought we had drowned them all,
and were standing still in the rapidly-clearing water,
looking around us with pricking conscience, when
I noticed one of the tricksters swimming rapidly
past my leg, about six inches beneath the surface.
Making a grab with both hands, I got the little
scamp; but although the water was only knee-
deep, not another one did we catch. When the
prisoner was released, he ducked away with a flop,
without so much as a thank you.
# * * *
A “paddy” in it, there had to be an argu-
ment :
“Coot”: “Tarago” (B. 2/8/’23) asks the origin
of the word “paddy-melon.” Morris in “Austral
English” says it is certainly a corruption of an
aboriginal name, “and is perhaps the best instance
in Australia of the law of Hobson-Jobson, by which
a strange word is fitted into a language, assuming
a likeness to existing words without any regard to
the sense.” The Sydney name for kangaroo was
patagorang. This word seems to give the first half
of the modern word. ‘Pata,’ or ‘Pada,’ was the
generic name; ‘mella’ an adjective denoting the
species. ‘Paddymalla’ (1827) marks an intermediate
stage, when one-half of the word has been anglicised.
At Jervis Bay the word ‘potalemon’ was used for
‘kangaroo.’ ”
“Hayband”: “Paddy-melon” is a witless corrup-
tion of the native name, parrimalla. It is a pity
that aboriginal names have been butchered in such
wholesale manner. The stupid misnomer “laughing
jackass” was applied to the pleasantly and aptly
named kookaburra by Governor Phillip in a fit of
THE PEA CE OFFERING.
“Teacher gave you a sixer for waggin' school,
didn’t he?"
“No fear! I gave him some of the fish I
caught.”
petulance 130 years ago. There was invariably a
reason behind an abo. name. For instance, the
suffix “bone” (Bugilbone, Quambone, etc. —nor’-west
N.S.W.) indicated water. The white way of plaster-
ing localities with the names of relatives, and of
allegedly world-shaking battles which to-day nobody
knows who won, and so on, has nothing to recom-
mend it. Say Moorabinda over two or three times.
It was the native name for Newcastle. Now say
Newcastle.
OLD BUSH TRACKS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a straight, white road that is leading east,
There’s a red road running west;
But the old bush tracks that are grass-grown now
Were the roads that I liked the best.
They had water-ruts where the wheel tracks were,
The wheels of the pioneers;
Those crooked ways of the olden days,
I have followed their dust for years.
There was one that led to a bushman’s home
(Bark-roofed and wattle and dab.
M ith a snug little kitchen built at the rear
Of pise and red-gum slab).
They tell me it’s now but a shepherd’s hut
And a cut line runs through the scrub,
M ith white mile-pegs and a telephone
That leads to the wayside pub.
I followed n't once with a horse to spare:
I’ve followed it on the tramp
When the banks doled out but a pint of flour
That was foul and old and damp;
And the boss came out in collar and tie —
His leggings and boots were tan —-
And said, ‘‘Do you know that you trespass here?
You’d better push on, my man!”
There are gaping cracks in the black-soil tracks
That lead to the Queensland creeks;
There’s a scoured sluice down on the pack-horse track
That comes from the mountain peaks.
’I here the cattle went stringing, one by one,
As they made for the river’s mouth
In the days when they travelled them overland
To the markets east and south.
There were short-cut tracks that the horses knew —
Soft sand to their shoeless feet —
Where the spreading red-gums flung a shade
That softened the blazing heat;
And the hot wind ruffled the fine red sand,
Like a beach that is lashed by the surf;
And mirage of water rippling clear
Lapped cool on a dream of turf.
But the track I like to remember best
Was worn by the children’s feet
As they made their way to the old slab school
In the little, old bush-town street.
It led through a hedge where the birds’ nests were,
By a tree where we’d hacked our names;
And passed by the hill where, the small church stood
To the yard where we played our games.
There is grass on most of the old tracks now —
Dry grass that the sun burns brown—
And an engine pounds on the iron rails
As it speeds to a sleepy town.
But the game old feet of those bygone days
Have taken the long last track.
They are rested now; but they’d hardly know
The roads that men tread out back.

ANNOUNCING A.
New Beale Placer-Piano Model
DURING the past five years improvement in player-piano construction has advanced
very rapidly. In the technical division of our own organisation experiment after experi-
ment has been conducted, always toward the goal of making a perfect, artistic interpretation
of the highest classical music a thing of easy accomplishment. We have produced a piano —-
the soul of any player-instrument—which is endorsed by countless numbers of concert artists.
Frank Hutchens, Lindley Evans, E. Bennett North, Henry Penn, W. H. Foote; these are
some of the giants in the musical world who have found the New Beale an ideal solo instru-
ment. For some years, too, we have been building a player-action into this piano—a com-
bination which has provided, in the one instrument, a means of perfect musical expression.
It was the New Beale Player-Piano of which Mr. Oscar Asche wrote: "It is impossible to
express in mere words my appreciation of your wonderful reproducing-piano.” We will still
continue to make the various models of the New Beale Player which are encased in rare cabi-
net woods and finished without regard to cost. But to this range of player-instruments we
now add the "Five-Three” Model —an instrument embodying all the superior interpretative
qualities of our previous productions and nearly all of their superior constructional features.
This new model will provide a piano of proved
quality, ready for the greatest demands of the
manually proficient musician, with an interpretative
complement that enables the non-technical musi-
cian to play with an understanding and skill far in
advance of many accomplished musicians. This
model is finished in genuine mahogany or quarter-
sawn English oak, the latter being £5 lower in
price than the mahogany, viz., £193. As it is so utter-
ly impossible to compare this instrument on a mere
price basis we have prepared very full details which
have been attractively printed. These details will
be sent post free or the actual instrument may be
heard in our showrooms mentioned below.

There was a sound of revelry—quite two
of the visitors were heard to laugh— at the
Uni. one night last week when the Scientist
in our Midst entertained the Visiting Scien-
tist ; and knowing what a whale for merry
jest and sparkling quip the visitor was, he
roped in the care-free Royal Society and the
roystering Lin mean Society to help as hosts
in the carnival. Prof. Edgeworth David,
Royal Society’s President Cambage and Pre-
sident Hull of the Linnmans (a society alto-
gether dissociated from the United Laundry
vVorkers’ Union) kept the fun rolling
blithely. There were intoxicating displays
of wild flowers, the zoologist coquetted
with the alluring young platypus, and the
dizzy cup was filled when Percy Marks un-
corked opals and sapphires, the most glitter-
some of which was the MacConnochie collec-
tion.
The overworked matinee has lost none of
its efficacy as a money-raiser, judging by
the two performances at the Royal this past
week. The first was to help the funds for
the Navy League’s cadets, and at a guinea
per seat it had a crowded-out reserve area.
It was an affair of society amateurs, with
enough pros, on the bill to amuse those
Philistfnes who don’t find Miss Darling
Point’s song-and-dance sufficient entertain-
ment for an afternoon. Mrs. Venour Nathan
organised the matinee, and appeared nine
times on a bill of 18 entries. Evelyn Mae-
kellar and Barley Westmacott showed pro-
mising form, and Mrs. Roy Buckland, in. a
fascinating coon rig. gave her perennial
favorite, “Mississippi Lou.” Pat Levy
worked overtime on ihe keyboard, while Mrs.
Pat did her bit for the Empire with a liawk-
er’s basket. One pretty flock traded in flow-
ers and sweets, another in programmes on
which a small cadet with incredibly blue
eyes and developed calves stood on the ex-
treme edge of the Gap and waved a Union
Jack at a limitless expanse of Pacific. Pre-
mier George Fuller made the speech that
bisected the programme; and Dame Mar-
garet, in the vice-regal party, found Jack
Cannot irresistible. Lee White, plus Clay
Smith, and graceful Lady Forbes Robertson,
provided other happy moments.
The Royal Players backed up Lee White's
appeal for St. Margaret’s last week with a
matinee. Bendrodt and Peggy Dawes were
gay splashes in an afternoon that hadn’t a
cloud in it.
There goes up a wail from the ladies’ com-
mittee of the Rawson Institute over the
resignation of Mrs. S. E. Laidley, Jean Aus-
tin and kindly Miss Margaret Harris. Miss
Harris’s generosity to the sailormen has
been unbounded. As a practical swan song
she installed two new bath-heaters in the
Institute. And, incidentally, whatever you
may have thought of the amateur perform-
ance of “Lady Patricia,” organised by Bar-
bara Knox and Ernest Watt, it at any rate
resulted in a cheque for £279 being handed
over for the further comfort of the deep-sea
men ashore.
It wasn’t only Who’s Who in R.C. Sydney
that tooted the family Ford to the Palais
Royal last Thursday night to dance a round
or two for the benefit of the Lewisham Hos-
pital. There were dozens of grateful “cases”
who, if asked their religious beliefs, would
have had to flip a coin to decide between
Monogamy and Christian Science. All told
they were a thousand or more strong, and
blown about the vast floorage like so much
chaff before the wind of jazz. The Palais
was flying the entire dementia of the decora-
tive scheme that had made the Movie Ball
such a mad, glad night; and here amidst the
barbaric stridency of what might be a
Spanish festa seen in nightmare, sedate medi-
cals and their ladies gambolled. One of the
most striking lookers of the evening was
Mrs. Herbert Marks, in floating softness of
the blue of the sky after rain. Mrs. T. J.
Dalton, the president, combined black satin
and ermine; pretty Mrs. Slattery flew black
panne velvet; and a perfectly stunning black
and gold cloak with an upstanding collar that
topped her eyebrows enveloped Miss
O’Keeffe. Mrs. Dalton, from Orange, trailed
turquoise-blue and gold, and Mrs. Warwick
Armstrong glittered in a fastness of black
jet.
Good-looking Phyllis Hazel is another Aus-
tralian songbird who is about to take flight
to older and colder countries for the purpose
of having a still more golden ring put into
her contralto notes, if that is possible. Syd-
ney tendered her the usual complimentary
concert at the Town Hall last week, and
teacher Charlie Smythe had reason to feel
proud of his pupil, who won the loud hand
from a big audience in the “Samson and
Delilah” number and in Granville Bantock’s
“Hymn to Aphrodite.”
On the night of the Artists’ Ball at the
Town Hall the color scheme will make the
rainbow look pallid. There are to be jazz
gateways where Hogarth-like faces will grin
and smirk. The balcony will be panelled
with amazing figures, each panel painted by
a different artist. There’s to be a Flying
Folly with a following of the weirdest and
most unexpected ; and the Father of all the
Sphinxes will roost before the organ-loft.
Every dancer must be masked; and there’s
to be a real studio supper in the basement.
Sounds as though there’ll be.a good cheque
to hand to the St. John Ambulance.
Marguerite Dale’s new’ play, “The Main-
stay,” was produced at the King’s Hall the
other night by Eleanor Ross and her band
of amateurs. It is not so good as the author’s
“Secondary Considerations.” The plot runs
on conventional lines; a young wife
with idpas rushes away from her hus-
band, who thereupon employs the nearest
pretty girl to bring the lady home via the
thorny path of jealousy. There is some good
characterisation, and a family game of bridge
supplies some five minutes or so of unforced
comedy. The most convincing actor in the
domestic upheaval was Major Ayris as a
near-gay bachelor uncle. Betty Braddock
was pretty enough to have made a convinc-
ing co-respondent if Jocelyn Gaden, as the
roaming wife, hadn’t displayed an equally
alluring profile. The play, 'which was pro-
duced in the interests of the Rome Congress
Delegates’ Fund, drew two crowded houses
of Repertorians, beginning playwrights, and
North-side intellectuals. Care-free youths
from Sydney Grammar, with a jocund taste
in socks, cheered the intervals with syncopa-
tion.
The Pomeranian and Toy Dog Club has
changed its old title and become the General
Dog Fanciers’ Club. Under its new dis-
guise it threw open the hospitality of in-
numerable dog-boxes on Saturday at the
R.A.S. grounds; and from Pekingese to
Great Dane the dogs of the village joyously
barked their pedigrees. The Irish terriers,
Sinn Fein and Free State, vociferously fought
over again the last election in the harassed
land of their forebears; Pekingese and pugs,
the social fluff of the dog-world, reclined on
cushions against colorful drapings ; and the
kelpies, in their eyes the suffering melan-
choly of one just emerging from a long
course of Thomas Hardy, yelped as though
pursuing the banshee of all the lost Causes
in the world over moor and fen. A cheerful
note was struck by the fox-terriers, who
seemed to have formed themselves into a
Chautauqua to bring sociability into the lives
of all. But why delay what this paragraph
had intended to say from the beginning—if
was a great show, large, representative and
full of sound!
Trixie Tange’s clever fingers and musical
temperament have placed her among the
front-rankers of Sydney’s younger pianists.
Her mop of
fuzzy fair hair
is almost a
landmark to
the visiting
artist. When
he looks down
and glimpses it
in the second
or third row
he knows he
has at last
reached Syd-
ney Town
Hall. Ver-
brugghen
thought highly
of the young-
ster, and the
fact that she
was the last
pianist to play
under his
baton in Syd-
ney is now
her proudest boast. It was her great Halle-
lujah, and under the stimulus she gave a
performance of the Lizst E Flat Concerto
that made the critics cheer. She gives her
maiden recital on the 19th of this month
at the Conservatorium, with the clever Cyril
Monk couple to strengthen the bill.
Mrs. Harold Fairfax and her helpers
netted over £6O for the Children’s Hospital
from the sale of Spring flowers on Friday
morning. Five thousand golden daffodils
glowed richly in the vestibule of Her
Majesty’s, side by side with banked-up prim-
roses and snowdrops; but by midday empty
stalls greeted the late-comer. Dame Mar-
garet Davidson, with Miss Henderson, was
among the early-morning buyers,
Tenor Sid Macdonald was only 34 when
le enc j came ] as t we ek; and for 17 of his
y ears he had been giving of his best in the
cause 0 f Charity. Only last year he hired
Conservatorium and paid the entire ex-
penses of a concert which he had organised
to f urn ish a little home for two invalid
W omen, a mother and daughter. Every penny
0 f the door money went to swell the final
cheque for something like £l5O. He was a
good friend to the Digger, too: he had sung
at over 500 concerts for Soldier funds. An
aged mother and a wide circle of friends are
in sorrow.
Immaculately groomed, Moiseiwitsch left
i as t Saturday by the much-delayed Marama,
en route to America to fulfil engagements,
a nd then he’s for England to join his wife
(Daisy Kennedy) and daughters Tatiana
and Sandra. Before leaving lie motored out
to Burilda Private Hospital, Summer Hill.
to say good-bye to uncle Jack Whear
Roberts, who is lying very ill in that insti-
tution, and is likely to remain there for
uiany weeks to come.
Pope Cooper, Queensland’s ex-Chief Jus-
tice, was one of the Coopers of Willeroo,
the N. S. Wales station which is now owned
by Pat Osborne. A brother died a couple
of months ago,
and a sister,
Mrs. Chris
Newt o n, is
still living in
Sydney. His
children (two
daughters and
a son) are in
England. Pope
Cooper had a
practically un-
checked march
to success. He
was not the
possessor of a
first-rate mind,
but he knew
what he
wanted an d
he was a skil-
ful handler of
men and
politicians. A
hard man on
the criminal bench, he bore a reputation in
the underworld of his State hardly less ter-
rible than that of N.S.W.’s Judge Docker.
Tall and handsome, with the pointed
beard and general appearance - of an ancient
Florentine, during the early part of his
life he gave a good deal of his time to social
gathering's in Sydney and Melbourne, as
well as in his own State. And he went to
England, where he had received most of his
education, as often as circumstances allowed.
The relaxation he most enjoyed was racing;
and he was one of the best judges of china in
Australia.
Back in Australia, Violet McGregor, Mel-
bourne’s violinist, who specialises in Scottish
airs. Violet’s bow holds magic in it for
Highlander and Lowlander alike, and the
Scottish societies of London in their enthusi-
asm nearly ate her and her mellow Clotz
fiddle. The Queen’s, Albert and Aeolian
Halls were a few of those she played in.
She brings back with her an exquisite wrist-
let watch that the Scotsmen of London gave
her to mark their appreciation; and when
she was coming through America the Edison
people, who had heard some tone-tests she
had recorded before leaving Melbourne, lured
her their parlor, and are the richer by
four Violet McGregor records. Of course
she did some broadcasting, too. In, private
life Violet is Mrs. of the Rudds of
Riverina.
Leo Austen, a younger brother of Peter
the poet, came down from Papua the other
day to take him a wife. The girl of his
choice was Marjorie Wilson, who returns
with him next week to help sustain the
honors of an Assistant Resident Magistracy.
Leo served four and a half years in the great
strafe, being at the beginning under 20. As
a schoolboy, in Brisbane, he was always
going to have a hand in the government of
New Guinea when he grew up. Peter, on
the other hand, was always going to be
something in Egypt; and there was some-
thing almost miraculous in the way they
both got their jobs.
It isn’t often a girl shines in sport as well
as in one of the arts. Daphne Akhurst is an
exception. For some years she was our
champion amateur tennis-player, and the
other night, at her recital at the Conserva-
torium, it was proved that she can strike
the piano keys as efficiently as she can wield
a racquet.
The Vagabonds are out after another
cheque. This time it is to help the fund for
the new hostel for the deaf and dumb; and
during last week they successfully staged St.
John Ervine’s comedy, “Mary, Mary Quite
Contrary”—first time in Australia. Ruby
Coxhead, whose magnetism is mainly respon-
sible for keeping the players together, played
the name-part; and George Stokes (Hobbes
the theatrical manager), Edward Jago (who
produced the play), Jack Rogers and Yaletta
Cohn were other principals in an acceptable
cast.
Farmer’s Exhibition Hall has given itself
up this week to a round of Spring Fashion
teas. They started with the afternoon brew,
but to-day (Thursday) and to-morrow the
mannequins will parade in their pretties for
the benefit of morning-tea drinkers. All the
new modes and materials take part in the
march past, georgettes and clinging materials
seeming to hold pride of place in spite of
the early-Victorian modes we have been
threatened with. The sleeve reaches vanish-
ing-point in many of the frocks, and embroid-
eries are still with us.
On September 24 the Feminists are dis-
guising themselves as belles of the Powder-
and-Patcli Period to help the club on the
road to sound finance and consequent happi-
ness. Artist Minus’s wife is one of the sec-
retaries, and Miss Plummer is the treasurer.
Mrs. Murray Campbell and Rose Merivale
can fold their hands till winter comes. The
two untiring workers for the Havilah homes
have put the last Cinderella away in moth-
balls till next year’s dancing blooms. Last
week the Paddington Town Hall blazed as
golden as an Iceland poppy for the final
flutter of 1023, and old supporters of Havilah
turned up in battalions, two very eye-filling
among them being Phil McLachlan and Mar-
garet Osborne.
Egg Day for Sydney Hospital draws on.
On Friday, 21st, Miss Boswell will receive the
offerings in the crypt of St. James’s. The
cause is a good one, so please remind your
barnyard laity to speed up and never mind
sectarianism or the split in the A.L.P.
Miss Lily Junker, writing from London,
is most enthusiastic about the Sydney
mezzo, Leah Myers, who appeared as Louise
at Covent Garden. The Sydney girl had quite
an ovation and was recalled over and over
again. When in Sydney Miss Myers studied
under Mrs. Allard (then Emma Sussmilch),
and there was nothing to undo in the matter
of voice-production when she got to London
A Brisbane postscript:—
Victoria Drummond, the pioneering engineeress
on the Anehises, dined at Government House the
other evening, and afterwards his Ex. went to the
first performance of “The Lie” at His Majesty’s.
The Tullys and Miss Williams, of California, were
included in the vice-regal theatre party, and Capt.
Hammond kept his eye on things. The Yoshino
Maru subsequently carried off the Californian girl
to China.
The Coorparoo Show was prised open by Sir
Matthew, who said he was delighted to find every
want catered for, from “best-kept gardens” to
billy-goat races; though as to the latter his Ex.
barracked for the female of the species after having
seen, the usefulness of Nan?|y—“the westerner’s
cow” —in the Backblocks.
Mail}’ gardens were robbed of roses to decorate
the South Brisbane City Hall for the cheerful jazz
of the students of the Pharmacy College. Sir
Matthew and his aide were received by the J. C.
Minnises and Mr. Cowley.
For 38 years the Lady Musgrave lodge has con-
tinued its good work in Brisbane. His Ex. presided
at the annual meeting the other day, with Victoria
Drummond in tow, and attended by Private Sec.
Michael Rogers. In the evening, accompanied by
Victoria Drummond, Capt. Hammond and Michael,
he went to two dances. One was at the Reg.
Hilleoats’, to help the Seamen’s Institute. Officers
of the Brisbane and Melbourne, whose boats are
now in the river, were also there, as were bishops,
judges, cadets of the Medic and Wangaratta, and
lots of Brisbane’s nice girls. The other was at
the Bellevue, in aid of the Children’s Hospital,
hostess Finnigan having lent the reception, ball and
dining rooms for the shivoo. Forty-five pounds
was raised by the auction of a doll, the N.S.W.
bowlers being responsible for this stunt.
The Pitt Rivers kiddies are staying at Govern-
ment House, having come there from Mrs. William
Collins’s place, Nindooimbah.
On Thursday Sir Matt, went to Bohemia, the
stronghold of the Classics, where a special pro-
gramme was turned on for the benefit of the Royal
Australian Naval Reserve Society. Lieut.-Commander
Mutton, Mulcahy, R.A.N.R. and Lieut. Keenan met
his Ex. The Bruche and Mutton ladies were among
those who got posies of sweet-peas tied with blue
and gold. Flag-captain Danby (of the Melbourne),
Capt. Feakes (the Brisbane) and many other gold-
braided gentlemen were in the house, which is a
large, new, semi-open-air building, and seems always
full.
T. C. Beirne gives a close personal supervision
to his big shop in Brisbane. Walking round the
other day he came across a lady who seemed very
annoyed with the telephone. “Can I help you?”
he asked. “Yes, perhaps you can get on to Ipswich,
because I can’t.” Stepping into the booth Beirne
asked for “Trunk Line” and immediately got into
touch with Ipswich. The lady thanked him pro-
fusely, used the ’phone and moved off. Meeting
a rather important-looking member of the staff
further down the shop, she remarked to him: “You
have a man up there worth whatever you pay him.
He is most courteous. I think you ought to give
him a rise.”

FOR THE SAFETY of YODR HOME
I T is not only the convenience and
economy of Delco-Light that has led
to its installation in so many country
homes, but also its safety—the fact that
there is nothing to upset, catch fire or
explode.
It enables country dwellers to have with-
out fear brilliant electric light wherever
they want it —in every room, in out-house,
hay-shed, stable and to light up the
grounds.
The Delco-Light Plant takes up little room and is so
simple to operate as to be practically self-operating. The
simplicity of its design and the strength of its construction
ensure long and reliable service; while its economy of
operation is so great that it soon “pays for itself.”
For the protection of your home, and in the interests of
comfort and economy, send for particulars showing how
easily you can obtain Delco-Light in your home.

Permanent Hair Waving
Accentuates Attractiveness
The many advantages of softly waved hair are
too obvious to need much commendation. To
the smart woman, so important a part does it
play in her coiffure, that it has become quite a
fashionable craze. Farmer’s use a special, per-
manent hair waving process which produces
exquisite waves that remain the same even
after shampooing, and does not in any way
effect the growth, or destroy the natural sheen.
Appointments may be booked by personal
application in the Hairdressing Salon, Third
Floor, or by phoning, City, Eleven Thousand.

MISSES MONNEDOVILE
pHOMES & cONTRAL 1532-1533.
Lady Forster wears rather a worried look
just now, thanks to a horrid cold his Ex.
picked up somewhere and can’t get rid of.
It gets him in the throat. For some weeks
his life has:been just one chill after another.
However, a trip to the Riverina sunshine
will probably present him with a perfect
cure.
The Queen Yic. Hospital’s appeal for
£30,000 was officially unleashed the other
afternoon by Lady Forster in the vice-regal
drawing-room. Ermine-furred above cloudy
grey chiffon, which glinted beadily in sec-
tors, she read her. piece from the throne,
flanked by the president and joint-organisers,
Mrs. Cabena, the Tallis dame and Mrs. W.
Robins ; also by Mrs. Norman Brookes, who is
the chairwoman. The vice-regal lady’s illu-
minative sidelights on the workings of the
“women-only” institution warmed up the
giving spirit, and offers of assistance show-
ered on her. In the middle of it all Irene
Vanbrugh popped up like a green-and-black
Jill-in-the-box with a promise of a matinee
from herself and husband Dion—and as
promptly bobbed down again. By the end
of the meeting over £lOOO in cheques had
fluttered in, and enough money-raising sug-
gestions to make the £30,000 seem easy get-
ting, the foundations having already been
laid with £3OOO from the Edward Wilson
Trust Fund. After the last promise had
been registered, Lady Forster led the way
to the dining-room, where the gathering
wound up as a tea-party.
The Best Dressed have been simmering
ever since word arrived oversea that the
Countess Stradbroke was bringing a “lady-
in-waiting” to Melbourne with her. The
narrow confines of vice-regal Stonington —
it doesn’t even run to a ballroom —hardly
lend themselves to such added glory. It
will be absorbing to watch if the Stradbroke
regime is to be tightened up officially. One
little turn of the screw would do no harm,
but a lady-in-waiting! Even the North-
cotes never thought of anything so imposing,
though they did launch the absurdly-out-of-
place curtsey.
At Trinity Church, Kew, the other day
little 19-year-old Mardi Syme and her quin-
tet, of youthful ’maids fluttered to the altar
like. a covey of snowy doves; and there they
met ex-naval-Commandcr Geoffrey Haggard,
who was supported .by Ernest Watt, of Syd-
ney. Misty tulle billowed from an anchor-
age of orange blossoms over the gold-flecked
bridal brocade, and more blossoms secured a
shawl (convoyed from mother’s ancestral
home in England by sister Ililaria), which
fell mantilla-wise from Mardi’s head. Yards
of rucked tulle sprayed with blossom trailed
behin'd, and were steered by the littlest Geoff
Syme daughter, Felicity, who, like the elder
’maids, walked with early-Victorian sweet-
ness in a white georgette straight jacket
over a hooped skirt of lace. The bride and
her attendant quartet —sisters Hilaria and
Joan, Nell Stead and Jean Foster —all car-
ried white roses, but Felicity’s tiny hands
were too full of tulle train to tackle any
floral impedimenta. For the occasion the
’groom had re-donned his discarded sailor
kit, and as chief usher Commander Bush
had got into his blue-and-gold trappings to
keep him in countenance.
Mrs. Geoff Syme struck envy in the best-
dressed with dusky draperies patterned
Orientally with beaten silver, a red-and-
belt and a black hat lightened with a
touch of red and silver also. The nauti-
cally decorated cake was cut in a monster
pink-lined tent; and the contracting pair
took so long shedding their wedding toggery
that half the guests had gone before the con-
fetti was requisitioned. After a few days
’mooning in the country they trip off to Eng-
land to get acquainted with each other’s ’in-
laws and restore the famous lace veil to
grandmamma, Mrs. Garnett, though rumor
has j it that it may have to make yet another
trip; oversea before very long. Among a
group of Age stars beckoned in for the wed-
ding were editor Schuler, leader-writer Cock-
erill and his wife, and chief-of-staff Aus-
tin ‘and his other half. The Lauchie Mac-
kinnons represented the rival daily. Squads
of Symes and Syme relations were there;
also the Sep Levys from Sydney, the Best
lady and daughter Margot, the Barrett lady
and her daughter Cara, Mrs. Harry Emmer-
ton, Mrs. Eric Harrison, the Norton Grim-
wades, the Walter Bayles, Nbrman Falkiner
and Arthur Bloomfield dames, the Johnny
Fairbairns and Dr. Stanley Argyle’s wife.
Mrs. John Farmer has gone to join her
lesser half in Paris. John has been running
a studio in the Naughty City for a good
while now; but you can’t take any risks these
days, you know.
Enthusiastic about the Great Ocean-road
along the south-east coast, Digger Ted Mor-
ley, M.L.A., acted as toll-keeper for three
weeks to let the regular man have a holiday.
He gleefully collected tips as well as gate
fees, and all went into the road fund. Meet-
ing later on at a swell seaside resort a fair
motorist who had told him to keep the six-
pence change, he asked her if
she could see her way to double the tip. The
lady got even by collecting all her friends
and telling them that Morley desired to enter-
tain them at afternoon tea, and tell them of
his exploits as a toll-keeper. But even then
he had something to the good—be declares
that he secured a dozen more supporters on
the spot for his Tote Bill.
A huge bridge flutter was turned on in
the Bob Knoxes’ Toorak ballroom the other
afternoon, to help the local auxiliary m con-
nection with' the impending Alfred Hospital
f§te. And £l5O was counted the
money-boxes were turned out. Mrs. Knox
flitted about pleasingly in cloudy black with
silver lace on her wide sleeve-ends and black
satin hat. Organiser Beatrice Henty, as
brigand-in-chief, kept her eyes moving, white
the hon. sec., Phyllis Walsh, worked over*
time handing out sheaves of Is. raffle-tickets
for a richly-stocked oak linen-press. That
keen golfist, Mrs. Trapp, turned a deaf ear
to the lure of the links that afternoon to
guard the tearoom, and a battalion of girls
did a heavy traffic in flowers and sweets.
The gathering was well creamed ; for bridge
nowadays is not categoried as “stuffy” even
by the flapper section.
Back from the fogs, Mrs. Harry Blake,
of Elmore, who went to call on brother Bill
Dyson and sister Ettie Owen, wife of Harri-
son, who now ranks as a well-known Lon-
don journalist. Harrison Owen is doing his
chief work for London Sketch and John
Bull, but works for several other periodicals,
besides keeping up his Australian connection
through Melbourne Herald. Bill Dyspn,
when his sister left, was still struggling
with his great idea of pigmy plays by autom-
atons for the movies, and was doing posters
for the picture people. One of these latter
is said to dominate London. Harry Blake
met his wife at Colombo. He is a member
of the family that has given several amateur
pedestrian champions to Australia, and was
himself a big winner in his day—that is to
say, only the other day.
This is Talma’s version of Constance Zie-
bell, a young Melbourne fiddler, who is mak-
ing her name known in musical circles. The
other night
she gave her
first recital,
and her hand-
ling of Max
Bruch’s “Ro-
mance,” a com-
position rarely
attempted by
musical debs.,
showed how
well she had
been schooled
by her teacher,
J. B. N o r t h.
Previously she
had shone in
a Saint-Saens
concerto, with
the Uni. Con.
orchestra sup-
plying the
b a c kground,
and she has
since done well as first violin in a big Town
Hall affair by the same organisation. Miss
Ziebell, who is a Mus.Bac. and an Ormond
Exhibitioner, has had her technique patted
on the back by Toscha Seidel, and, inci-
dentally, she owns a violin by Alessandro
Gagliano, dated 1727, which connoisseurs
smack their lips over.
The George Hendersons’ pretty elder daugh-
ter, Peggy, kept a matrimonial engagement
with Frank Sampson the other evening at Holy
Trinity, Kew. Her clerical brother, Ken-
neth, without the least compunction helped
Canon Sutton adjust the fateful knot. The
bride was enveloped in. the usual trappings,
and her train was held by niece Barbara
Henderson, who gazed starry-eyed from
under a daisy wreath topping a white crepe
frock. Two small sisters assisted the briies-
maidens, Lynette Henderson and Rita Samp-
son, who were in apricot silk circled midway
with wallflowers, and sported veils of a
darker shade bound to their heads with the
same sort of flowers; J. R. Bishop and Mel-
bourne Cowle supported the ’groom. The
parental Hendersons —she in black satin dis-
closing some cheerful Chinese embroideries —
spread a wedding supper in the usual pink-
lined marquee after a reception in their
Hawthorn parlors. General “Pompey”
Elliott and Canon Sutton were chief toast-
makers. At the finish, the bride, having
switched into China-blue crepe peppered with
silver marguerites under a gay-colored cloak,
slipped off in the conventional confetti storm.
Frank Clarke, recently elected the
chair of the Upper House, vacated by Walter
Manifold on account of bad health, is the
third of his generation to star in local poli-
tics. His
father, the
first baronet,
sat among the
Landlords for
27 years, and
his father was
there before
him. Gtand-
dad Snodgrass
(on the mater-
nal side) also
helped to
make political
history that
was in the
early ’fifties,
when he was
a member of
the Advisory
Board which
looked after
things ' before
N. S. Wales
and Victoria
were divorced. All members of the ClarKe
family have inherited a cheerful spirit of
philanthropy from the late baronet and his
3 wife, whose good deeds were never-ending
and whose hospitality was generous and
widespread, f rank Clarke, ’ with his wile
and just-grown-up daughter, lately landed
back from a European trip, and they are
hiring the Donald Mackinnons’ South Yarra
house until Donald gets back from his mis-
sion to Washington. This photo of the new
President was made by Broothorn.
Gloom settled on the Melba Con. the other
day, when word, came from Anne ' > llliams
telling thejja to lay off her welcome home
as, acting $n Dame Nellie’s advice, she v. as
anchoring in the Fog for a time. _ Anne
seems to be in demand, seeing that Landon
Ronald invited her to take a job of voice
training at the Guildhall School of Music,
and the great Paris teacher Ponsot wanted
her to stay and help him. Thanks to Melba,
she already has a bunch of. fine voices to
shape. Fof Anne’s recital in the Dames
new Mayfair place the best crowd stormed
up to get an inside view of Melba’s town
house, but they remained to wonder at the
beauty of Anne’s voice. And the experts
also enthused over Fritz Hart’s Shepherd
and a sonsrlet, “Snowfall,” by Molbe Carew.
“Wilma Berkeley,” says Anne Williams, is
shaping for success.”
Melbourne Grammar had its annual theat-
rical show last week in two spasms in the
big Millear Hall. Despite the heavy handi-
cap of manly voices, the youngsters made
rather more than a mere success of “Niobe, ’
with padre Arnold, of the school, as pro-
ducer and stage-manager, and Francis Wil-
son, Harvey Barrett and Roy Grounds in
the principal roles. The school orchestra,
which has broken into a jazz band, made
much noise between acts, and after the final
curtain the head fed the performers
and a group of friends on cream-puffs and
coffee in his private parlor, among the nib;
blers being General Grimwade, Morris Wil-
liams, Tom Millear, Bertie Austin and one
or two other school councillors and their
wives. .
Nicholas Lockyer’s younger, daughter, Ellis,
who lately returned from a trip to the Malay
States, is now collecting trousseau glories
and congratulations before steaming back—
this time without a return-half to her ticket.
She will go under the wing of her sister,
Mrs. Roddy Alsop, who will hurry home
directly after she has seen Ellis handed
safely into the keeping of a young English-
man named Bagnall, who earns a crust m
that moist region. G
Neville Joske and Margot Goyder, two
charming Melbourne girls, leave for England
next month. East , year, as joint authors,
they made a hit with their first novel, “Mari-
etta Is Stolen,” which quickly went into its
second edition. Their publisher, Leonard
Parsons, was so pleased that two more books
have been written to his order, and a third
is in hand. Mrs. Joske also contemplates
the publication of a book of verse.
The Playhouse overflowed with proud
parents, sisters and brothers the other night,
when Nellie Veitch’s elocution class at
Toorak St. Catherine’s took the limelight in
a brace of playlets. Shyness having been
severely hunted out of school life, the youth-
ful stars were not hampered with the old-
time self-consciousness; so they put on an
enjoyable little show which was considerably
helped along by being particularly . well
dressed. The evening wound up with ribbon
streamer entanglements between the stalls
and stage.
Isabel Carlyon, whose big father is the
kingpin of the famous St. Ivilda hotel and
jazzery, has confessed to intending matri-
mony with Harry Scott, son of the late Mr.
and Mrs. Harry Scott, of Sydney.
Poet Rupert Atkinson has gone north, and
is recuperating in Brisbane after an opera-
tion. In January he goes to England via
America, and intends to join his wife in
London. Mrs. Atkinson, in emulation of
her husband, has written a book, and is in
search of a publisher.
The Red Cross has hired a room on the
first floor of Victoria Buildings, in Queen’s-
walk, as a central depot for the sale of the
handiwork of sick and wounded soldiers. It
will be open daily, and will be looked after
by recruits. Leather, raffia and seagrass
work and embroideries are only a few of the
things turned out by Billjim’s capable
fingers, so there are plenty of articles to
catch the crowd. Doormats and baskets will
be supplied by the blinded-soldier section.
Hitherto Caulfield Hospital, which is too
far away for shoppers, has been the only
sales-arena provided for them.
Artist Pen Boyd, who is responsible for
the European art collection, has paint in his
blood. Both his father and mother (she
was an A’Beckett) used to do landscape
work, and Pen and his brother cut their
teeth on palette-knives. Boyd pere, whose
father was a retired British Army officer,
sprang from Victoria’s finest pioneer stock.
His grandfather, Dr. Martin, who owned a
large acreage at Heidelberg, had daughters
widely famed for their beauty. One was the
wife of the late City Coroner Youl, the good
old infidel who bade his family circle fare-
well over a glass of champagne. Mrs. Mar-
tin, whose name was De Guzman, was grand-
daughter of a Spanish grandee of the name.
She left her descendants a collection of rich
jewels and laces, and probably it was she
who bequeathed the artistic strain which
came out so loudly in Pen and his brother
Meyrick. The latter centres his artistic ener-
gies on the more commercial line, of pot-
tery Both brothers donned khaki in the
war. One Boyd aunt, Mrs. John Gurner, who,
like her particular chum, the Hodges dame,
has a leaning towards Theosophy, has
launched several interesting poem, booklets
said to have been spiritualistically-inspired,
Arthur L. Benjamin writes from “The
Top o’ the Rise, Bear’s Green, Surrey.” He
has composed and published several songs,
and, in the meantime, has been working hard
with the intention of returning to the concert
platform, and, incidentally, by that means, to
Australia.
Mrs. F. G. Clarke., wife of the new Presi-
dent of the Council, maintains her good
looks, girlish figure. and brightness despite
the care of five youngsters. She was a
Cotton, and her father was a banker at
Daylesford. It was a love match. She takes
a certain amount of interest in politics, but
is more interested in Frank and his personal
doings. At sessional-opening at-homes she
will be an ideal hostess.
A line or two from Adelaide: —
There was fine weather for the finish of the golf
tournament, and the foursome championship was
thrilling, a Victorian duo, the Gatehouse and Lees
matrons, winning by a single stroke. But the Vic-
torian women outclassed the S. Aus. representatives
in the inter-State teams match. The Francis j.
Fishers entertained the visitors at afternoon-tea at
Seaton on the; Thursday, and on the following day
the Maxwell Fowler, E. M. Gardiner and E. Britten
Jones matrons fed them at a lunch.
Wattle Day ended up with not a man to be seen
without a yellow sprig in his coat. Josie Melville,
accompanied by Mrs. Percy Moss and George High-
land, sold tons of golden bloom, and her collecting
box had as many notes as silver coins by the time
she had visited Tattersall’s Club, Parliament House
(where she vamped the Premier) and other points
of vantage.
The dance and tea-party at the Grosvenor given
by Louisa Larsson and Bobbie Helpman for Josie
Melville and the co. proved a huge success. Every
one seemed to have a great time, and Bobbie’s mother
looked after every item that could possibly contribute
to that result.
The dance in aid of Lady Victoria Buxton Girls’
Club, in the Osborne Hall, raked in many shekels, and
gave the social birds an opportunity to entertain
some of the dancing golfers prior to their departure.
Lady Bridges was. there, in black lace and diamond
tiara, accompanied by Miss Judge.
There was a bumper crowd at the Town Hall
reception-room, when Mrs. Edith de Castro. M.8.E.,
spoke on “The English-speaking Union.” The meet-
ing had been convened by the Premier, but as he
couldn’t get there himself Judge Angas Parsons took
the chair.
The Keep, Gatehouse and Lees dames, three of the
Melbourne golfers, entertained Lily Gordon (winner

NOTIONS
"ON TOP" WITH
MICK SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKLE
Saturday’s racing at liandwick was a re-
freshing change from the inferior sport' served up on
seedy suburban courses, of which there are far too
many about Sydney. Instead of the customary ragged
platers, some of the best horses in the land were
on exhibition, and five of the eight races provided
exhilarating 1 finishes. A neck was the margin by
which Woodville (20’s) and Wrangle (2's) won the
first and second sections of the six-furiong Welter;
heads decided the matter in the divided mile handicau
for three-year-olds, Shrapnel getting home at 10’s and
Rahiri at s"to 2 ; and at the end of the 10-furlong
September Handicap David (33’s), Rapine (14’s),
Royal Box (20’s) and Kingslot (9 to 2) were almost
in line. The judge placed them in the order named,
and although the crowd had mostly lost its money
it generously cheered the victory of a great and
game specimen of the native-born thoroughbred—a
horse that is the best of advertisements for the old
Australian strains. His race at Moorefield and a
subsequent gallop evidently brought David on, but
he is by no" means ready even yet. At Moorefield,
however, he was ridden behind the field, a fashion
he dislikes, especially when the going is on the heavy
side; at Randwick he was allowed to stride along
with the leading division, and in the strenuous
struggle up the straight his gameness supplied what
he lacked in. condition. Kingslot, nevertheless, was
finishing faster than the placed horses, and his num-
ber would have been hoisted with another hundred
yards to go. The Queenslander carried his Metropoli-
tan weight (Bst. 91b.) and looked bright and well.
Sunburst (10 to 9 on) justified his high Victorian
reputation by handsomely defeating a good field in
the six-furlong Warwick Stakes, w.f.a. with penal-
ties and allowances. E. A. Connolly’s other horse.
Polytheist, was third (The Monk, carrying lib. more
than Sunbuyst, separated them), and his cast-off,
Fleuriste (s’s), won the Liverpool Handicap, from
King’s Trumpeter, Furious and other good milers,
for W. Kelso. On this form Connolly will have a
big sav in the destination of another Epsom, for it
is obvious that he wouldn’t have sold Fleuriste for
.e.kuo if he hadn’t been convinced that the English-
bred stallion, then rising seven, was inferior to Poly-
theist, leaving Sunburst out of the argument. In the
big mile race Polytheist has Bst. 71b. and Sunburst
9st. 81b., a difference of 161 b. in the younger
horse’s favor as compared with their weights on
Saturday. Less forward than his stable-companion
I’olytheist finished stoutly in his first nice up the
long straight, and at this stage he looks rather the
better proposition for the September 29 handicap.
There are some very decent three-year-olds about
this year. The Monk is a beautiful colt and, judged
as a sprinting effort, nothing could have been more
impressive than the way he ran past half-a-dozen
horses over the last furlong of the Warwick Stakes,
and that with 31b. more on his back than was
carried by the well-performed and solidly-supported
Wish Wynne. The run demonstrated his quality oyer
a short distance, but didn’t settle the question
whether he ‘can stay. A sterner test in this regard
was answered by Rahiri, who, his 9st. 12lb. notwith-
standing, resolutely withstood two challenges in the
closing stages of a mile run in lmin. 39$sec., and it
takes a hors# with real stamina to do that. Some of
the critics won’t have Tressady as a sire of Derby
winners, but there is stout blood in Rahiri on the
dam’s (Scotch Mary) side. Leonardo (Beragoon—-
Golden Fly)-was finishing fast against Rahiri, and had
Irish Rhythm (Eudorus Irish Jig) got out a bit
earlier in the other division Shrapnel would have
been placed second instead of first. This Irish
gentleman is a chestnut of promise. The favorite,
Sandringham, shaped indifferently in this race, and
King Carnival, after pacing it with the leaders to
the straight entrance, came in last. He was un-
backed, certainly, but for a horse which is supposed
to have a chance in a classic only a month off, he
should have done a lot better.
It would have paid to tote Maoriland horses in
the six flat races for which they started. Wrangle
was their only winner, but Bathos, Director, Bally-
mena, Rapine, Royal Box and King’s Trumpeter were
in places; and they mostly paid good dividends.
Ballymena and Urgency (unplaced in the September
Handicap) look strung up, but Rapine, Royal Box
and King’s Trumpeter can be improved. So by the
same token can The Hawk, who ran an encouraging
fourth in the Sunburst Stakes.
! * * * *
The racing at Caulfield left a local sense
of dissatisfaction. A young four-year-old mare,
Maid of the Mist (12’s), ran away with the Memsie
Stakes, the field including Backwood, Easingwold,
Purser, The Cypher, Graeulus and Frances Tressady.
Easingwold and young Drongo filled the places, and
the final run of the unthought-of three-year-old was
perhaps the most impressive circumstance of the
afternoon. The first effect of the race was to weaken
public regard for imported Backwood (although the
English horse ran a good deal better than Purser
and The Cypher) and to take all the polish off the
reputation that Graeulus had earned by his victory
over Tabragalba and others at Flemington a fort-
night earlier. Graeulus, to be sure, had beaten
Drongo on that occasion, but the distance was then
a furlong shorter, and on the face of things it was
the extra furlong that troubled the dapper little
son of Magpie tnis time. The owner of Maid of
the Mist showed his consideration for punters by
scratching his bonny mare for the Caulfield Cup,
ere a lot of money could be lost on her.
This first slap in the eye for local expectation
was followed by an even sharper whack when Wynette
(12’s), a six-.vear-old mare from S’Australia, won the
Heatherlie Handicap in a second faster time than
they made in the Memsie Stakes. Wynette beat a
lot of Cup fancies, among them Heir Apparent,
Yacamunda, Caserta and Sonora, and did it so well
that she threatens danger in the Caulfield Cup. For
that race she was let in at 6st. lllb. ; she is not
engaged in other big handicaps, Sydney or Melbourne.
Whittier’s backers bemoaned his absence from the
Memsie Stakes field. The family pride, however,
was asserted in the last race of the day when
his brother, Accarak, in the same ownership, won
in good style. Accarak has 6st. 71b. in each of the
Cups.
“0.K.”: The poor showing that Bradfield’s stable
made at Caulfield was a damper t\ the spirits of
such as had talked of “Bradfield’s ’of' repeating the
record of four years ago, when Lucknow, Night-
watch and Chrome filled the Caulfield Cup places.
There is, of course, time for Backwood to be
mightily improved before |)ctober 20, but the
fact remains that when Lucknow was going to win
the big event from his stable companions, all three
of them ran brilliantly at the V.A.T.C. September
meeting. Neither is there any denying that Heir
Apparent’s recent performances were hardly as good
as might have been expected of a coming Cup-
winner at the same stage of his preparation. He
was given an outside chance in a sprint race at
Flemington, and he cut no figure at all in the
finish. He was backed down to 5 to 2 for the
Heatherlie Handicap, but he never went so fast as
the S’Australian mare Wynette after she had slipped
by him m the straight. Heir Apparent is no bobby-
dazzler. Last Sydney Cup may have seen the best
of him. It seems to* have seen the best of Shilling-
lee, anyhow. The track work of the English horse
can hardly be called work at all, and his Melbourne
Cup chance looks negligible. He has been taken
out of the Caulfield and the Metropolitan.
KINDLY MEANT.
AUNT: “Have you done your kind deed to-day, Cuthbert?”
CUTHBERT THE SCOUT : “No, auntie .”
AUNT: “Well, yet those men their hall. But, mind, if they want
to recompense you, he a little gentleman and refuse.”
“Jam wood”: About the time David was
winning at Randwick, a grave was dug for his
grand-dam, Wakeful, at Arrowfield (N.S.W.). The
mare was 26 years old, and it is just on 20 years
since she registered the greatest performance of
her career —that of running second in the Melbourne
Cup, with lOst. up, to a really first-class three-year-
old in Lord Cardigan, who had only 6st. 81b.
That was the lovely lady’s last race, and Lord
Cardigan’s close second to Acrasia, as a four-year-
old carrying 9st. 61b., was his last race. Wakeful
started 44 times for 25 wins, 12 seconds and four
thirds. Her most glittering successes were in the
Sydney Cup (with 9st. 71b.), the Doncaster and
Newmarket Handicaps and the Oakleigh Plate, and,
better ridden, she would have added to them tor
instance, the 1901 Caulfield Cup, in which she was
beaten in the last few strides by Hymettus, after
being driven along at the head of the field all the
way, was thrown in the air. Her severe racing
career militated against her success at the stud,
but she produced a Melbourne Cup-winner in Night-
watch and it was from his grandmother that
David got the Trenton and Panic blood which makes
him the steel-limbed, lion-hearted customer he is.
* * *
“Fax” : Talking of Purser’s pretensions to
acquire a Melbourne Cup (B. 30/8/’23), one thinks
naturally of John Wren’s gelding, The Rover, it is
not necessary to have faith in The Rover as a
trusty animal to admit that he has a far better
Melbourne Cup chance, on paper, than his old oppo-
nent Purser, who is a year younger, but has done
far more, work in his time than Wren s horse. When
The Rover was six years old he ran second for the
Melbourne Cup wherein Purser, with 7st. 71b., ran
sixth. That is to say, two years ago he gave lllb.
and a big beating to the same horse who now is
handicapped to give him 171 b. A difference of 28
pounds in The Rover’s favor, not to mention the
big beating and the fact that he a proved stayer.
J. O. Anderson and J. B. Hawkes suffered
the expected defeat in the Davis Cup contest, but
gave a good account of themselves. Which also was
expected. Anderson started encouragingly by smash-
ing his way to victory in the fifth set of a thrilling
match with Johnston (4 —6, 6—2, 2—6, 7—5,
6 —2). At that juncture, and again in the doubles,
when Australia was a set to the good after the most
strenuous encounter in the history of the game,
our men locked to have a chance, but Tilden was
too tough. He vanquished Hawkes in straight sets
(6—4, 6—2, 6- —1), and after 65 games had been
played in the doubles, the Australians winning 34
of them, his serving and Williams’s backhand proved
too much for the weakening Australians, and the
rubber went to America (17- —15, 11—13, 3—6,
6—3, 6—2). Then Johnston, by disposing of
Hawkes (6 —0, 6—2, 6—l), clinched his country’s
right to sport the trophy for another year—it has
been an American possession since 1920. The con
eluding match, Tilden v. Anderson, was much closer,
but the big Yank remained unconquered (6 —2,
6—3, I—6,1 —6, 7—5). In Davis Cup singles he has
never lost a rubber.
“15-30”: In my opinion Anderson’s defeat of
Johnston last week gives him greater rank as
a player than a similar victory over Tilden would
have done. Ever since I saw Johnston and Tilden in
Australia I have had the feeling, not popular else-
where, that Johnston is the greater artist of the
two. The fact that Tilden has beaten Johnston more
often than the Californian has returned the compli-
ment would seem to disprove this contention, but
yet it ean’t be gainsaid that Johnston has proved
more formidable to other champions than his long
and active rival from Philadelphia. Tilden was
licked by Anderson in a match in Chicago two years
back, and he has since been knocked out by the
Spaniard Alonzo and the youthful Vincent Richard 4.
AVhat have we to record against Johnston in this, his
most energetic year of tennis? He went to Europe a
few months ago and smothered the pick of the Con-
tinent in the hard-court championship, finishing off
in the final the brilliant Belgian, Washer, who is
unquestionably one of the greatest hard-court players
in the world. Going to Wimbledon Johnston played
so fiercely that only one man, Campbell, snatched
a set from him during the whole campaign. Richards,
the boy marvel, who had finished Tilden, went down
in three straight sets, and Hunter, who, if I remem-
ber rightly, walloped our Patterson in the Seabright
(U.S.A.f tournament last, year, was similarly dealt
with. Johnston’s one loss
to date is Anderson’s
triumph, and the achieve-
ment is magnificent, seeing-
that Anderson not only
overcame the psychological
disadvantage of facing a
man who had made him
look like a tyro last year,
but also battled out of a
pinch, with two sets lost
in the first three, and tore
the match out of the grip
of his tenacious opponent.
Only Tilden has ever been
guilty of that performance
against Johnston. The
Yanks must now regard
Anderson as having a very
strong chance for the U.S.
National singles commenc-
ing in a few days’ time.
“Linesman”: W. M. Til-
den, who lately appointed
himself tennis prophet to
his nation, has come a
couple of “gutsers” over
the Australians. When
Anderson and Hawkes were
leading against Shimidzu
and Fukuda he confidently
announced that the Japs
would capture the two final
singles and face France at
Boston. Being asked for
an opinion about the just-
concluded battle for the
Davis Cup, he hazarded the
view that “we [Johnston
and himself] will probably
go crazy and sweep the
board.” Johnston, he
added in an amended pre-
diction, woulfl dispose of
Anderson comfortably in
four sets. Tilden is not
so happy at gauging form
on the spot as is Gerald
Patterson from half a
world away. Patterson
was the one voice among
the multitude of experts who
proclaimed his faith in his countrymen to the extent
of expecting them to win all five matches against the
Japanese. They got four, and the other was uncom-
monly close. Then Gerald weighed in with a modestly-
expressed suggestion that Anderson was quite equal
to beating Johnston. His belief in J.O.’s brilliancy
-—the more striking because it came from a rival—•
was abundantly justified.
Still unbeaten this season in representa-
tive long-distance races Frank Bailey is now 10-mile
champion of N. S. Wales. As good on the flat as
over the jumps, Bailey waited on his field —it in-
cluded the pick of the Sydney stayers, along with
J. E. Bell (Vic.) and Lucas, Joyce and Thomson
(Tasmania)—-for the greater part of the journey, and
won with a rare finishing sprint in 54min. 14sec.
Mackenzie was 3sec. away, Sheaves a fair third, and
the teams race went to South Sydney. The young-
ster should now spell for a bit; he has done enough
this season.
* * * *
“Push Off”: “Centurion’s” remarks (B.
30/8/’23) re American amateurism are interesting,
but does such a thing exist 1 A likely-looking
athlete need never starve in the U.S.A. ; one of the
big athletic clubs Will always provide him with
hoard, bed and clothing. And expenses. He may
not be required to compete for money prizes, but he
won’t have to toil for a living, so long as he keeps
in condition. Weissmuller, the swimmer, said to be
the son of poor parents, has been living on the fat
of the land for three years. But the business was
overdone in Weissmuller’s case, formatter shattering
every world’s record from 100yds. to 500 metres, he
is reported to be suffering from a heart malady
which has terminated his career as a swimmer. And
be is still only 19.
Had Digger Evans ever been taught to
punch he would have beaten Villon, the Filipino, in
their bout at the Sydney Stadium. But punching
is an art that the average Australian pug never
acquires, so, after outpointing Villon for six rounds,
the Digger was floored in the seventh with a clout
on the ribs, and again with one on the neck. As
game as a pebble, he boxed well in the eighth, but he
was twice down in the next round, three times in
the eleventh, and in the twelfth Villon knocked him
through the ropes with a right on the chin. It was
the finish.
* * ■* *
“Lei” : Environment is sometimes the mosi
powerful factor in the creation of boxers. One of
the most game and skilful pugs I ever met confided
to me that it was neither inclination nor natural
ability that- determined his vocation. As a youth
lie lived in the ’Loo, on the border-ground of the
activities of two redoubtable pushes. Being a
husky, hefty lad, each of the rival organisations
discerned in hint a likely recruit and pestered him
with invitations to join up. He refused, having
no taste for the unsavory business, and there the
matter might have ended if each band of larrikins
hadn’t got the idea into its prognathous head that
the young chap was turning it down because of the
superior attractions offered by the rival mob of
gladiators. The consequence was that his life was
made a danger by assailants leaping out at him
from dark corners o’ nights, until in self-defence
he was forced to take lessons in that art. His
instructors found him an unexpectedly apt pupil, and
the end of it was that he became a professional
boxer. Probably the prevailing rowdiness of White-
chapel, Bristol and Birmingham made them equallv
fine forcing grounds for fistic talent in the palmy
days of the British prize ring.
* * *• *
Saturday’s Vic. League games left the con-
stitution of the final tour still in doubt, only
Carlton being definitely sent to join Richmond and
Melbourne in outer darkness. Collingwood, having
lost games they should have won, have now to do
their darnedest, so there was no undue courtesy
about their scrimmage with Carlton, who had a
“possible” when the game began. Some 25,000
spectators roared and raved as heavy men went down
like ninepins, and when the end came neither
side oould claim superiority—lo goals 12 behinds
all. St. Kilda, with but one more game to play, and
that against the determined Southerners, crashed be-
fore Fitzaoy—97 points to 69-—so their chance isn’t
a great deal better than Buckley’s. Geelong took
no risks with Richmond, winning by 91 to 79.
They yet have to meet Essendon and Carlton, both
games on their own ground, and one victory will
put them in the four. Essendon, calm and serene
at the top of the list, added to their percentage of
points scored, finishing with 98 to Melbourne's 41.
“Trekle”: There was a time when almost
every Melbourne team had its public jester, but now
the Aussie game has become much too serious a busi-
ness for merriment.; Micky Londeregan, of Essen-
don, is perhaps the host-remembered joker, but Billy
Mahoney (“The Rat’’), of Richmond, a much finer
player, also did odd tricks. Kicking the back of his
own heel and falling heavily, whan screened from
the umpire, brought Mahoney many frees, and if this
happened close, but not close enough to goal, he
would gammon to be partially stunned. Then, when
the ball was thrown to him for his unearned kick, he
would let it bounce off his body, but in a chosen
direction. The man on the mark would only shed
his solicitude for the victim of circumstances when
Billy, wonderfully recovered, had streaked past him
and kicked a goal.
The football finals in Adelaide promise
plenty of excitement. Norwood, unbeaten all the
season and easily minor premiers, have in two"con-
secutive games played a tie with North Adelaide (not
likely to be in the final four) and taken a bad
beating from Port Adelaide (with no hope of.
being in the four). Thus anything may happen in
the last round.
In an untidy League struggle on Sydney
Cricket Ground Eastern Suburbs gained their
eleventh successive victory, downing Glebe by 1 3
points (3 tries 2 goals) to 11 (3 tries 1 goal). Their
outstanding player was the ex-Union man, Jack
Dawson, who shone among the threequarters. “Blucy”
Watkins played a great game for the Surfers, doing
three men’s work in defence and participating in
every goal ward gallop. Newtown defeated North
Sydney (all at sea since Thompson was suspended)
by l 6 to 7, and South Sydney scored 17 to St.
George’s 6, while Balmain, behind at the interval,
wore Western Suburbs doyvn and ended with 20 to
10. With one . more round to go Eastern Suburbs
look certainties for the premiership, and after next
Saturday East, South, ’Main and either West or
Glebe will decide the destiny of the City Cup.

Maoriland gave N.S.W. an awful doing
in the second Rugby Union meeting at Christchurch,
scoring 34 points to 6. Nothing like it has hap-
pened since the matches began in 1884. The winners
got over seven times, and Sinclair kicked six goals.
N.S.W.’s tries were scored, by wing-threequarter D.
Erasmus and breakaway W. J. Marrott; their goal-

Certain Sydney men are out to form a
company with a capital Of £300,000' to establish
and run a motor-racing track at Maroubra Beach.
It is proposed to take over an option on a lease of
80 acres, the consideration being £2500 in cash and
2:5,000 £1 shares (for three years they are not
to draw dividends unless the profits exceed 12 p.e.),
and to get along with the construction of a
saucer traek, with grandstands, motor-parks, lawns,
etc., at an estimated cost of £210,000. To re-
concile shareholders to the prospect of such a huge
outlay, it is obvious that an immense income must
be forecasted, and that has certainly been done-
on paper. But an estimated annual revenue of
£132,375, to be drawn from one Grand Prize meet-
ing a year, three special meetings and 16 ordi-
nary meetings, is apt to take the breath away. The
investing public is asked to believe that because
horse-racing and football already draw vast crowds
in Sydney, motor-racing will quickly attain a popu-
larity similar to what it enjoys in Indianapolis and
Los Angeles, despite the fact that the car-owning
American is the rule and the ditto Australian the
exception. Totalisator rights are also to be asked
for;, and the chance of getting them (although this
isn’t mentioned) is quite a million to one. Sydney
should be able to support a speedway, but the ideas
and forecasts under consideration are too fantastic
altogether.
TRAGEDY (FOR POKER PLAYERS).
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Gently I held that little hand in mine.
I turned my eyes to earth lest they should shine
Too brightly, and betray the wild unrest
That surged tumultuous in my joyful breast.
I knew that 1 above all men was blest,
But of that feeling I displayed no sign.
At length I spoke in measured tones and slow,
As if regardless what my words conveyed.
Xo answer came. 1 paused, then, half-dismayed,
I spoke once', more —and felt I was afraid.
I nerved myself to bear Fate’s fiercest blow.
Across my senses crashed that dread word “No.”
That honr of gloom I never can forget.
1 held Four Aces —and no blighter bet!

THE INKY WAY.
“Bones an’ Blud”: “It’s true the circulation is
poor,” admitted the advertising chief of our latest
moral-uplift publication. “Some have gone so far
as to call it ‘direful.’” And then, more brightly:
“But look at the display we’re in a position to offer.
It is more than likely yours will be the only ad. in
the issue.”
Thomas Davies Little, Parramatta’s oldest native
journalist, who died the other day, was born 68
years ago in Howell’s old water-mill, a short dis-
tance from the town. When the first National school
at .Parramatta started, in the old Baptist Church, his
name headed the roll. The Cumberland Argus was
launched by him and others 36 years ago.
The Melbourne Stock Exchange is going to have
its own monthly journal, and the first editor will be
James Ernest Martin, at present Assistant-Deputy
Federal Tax Commissioner. Sixteen years ago Martin
joined the State Land Tax Department as a clerk,
and three years later was transferred to the Federal
office, and took a hand in organising the branches in
Sydney, Adelaide and Perth.
It has been an astonishing season in Sydney for
new papers ; any morning you are liable to find that
a Jonah’s gourd has sprung up over night and climbed
to the top of the bookstalls. They don’t all live
long; at least half-a-dozen haven’t got past Vol I,
No. 1. But if the quality of the production can
save it, the very latest, the Pacific, will last. It is
a finely illustrated shilling weekly printed on art
paper, and has the skilful hand of A. de R. Barclay,
formerly of the Sunday Times, behind it.
“N. 8.” : One member at least of the Henry Lawson
Memorial Committee is doing something to keep alive
the poet’s name and bring the object of the memorial
under the notice of the great many who loved his
works. Mrs. Mary Gilmore has recently addressed
the Women’s and Lyceum Clubs in Sydney" and the
Catholic Club and two High Schools in Goulburn
on the appeal, and has also circularised some of
the country and inter-State press on the subject,
Can half as much be said of some of the other mem-
bers of the committee?
“P.X.”: E. J. Brady is one of the pretty numer-
ous Australians who are torn between Literature and
£sd —and nowadays he finds that £sd nearly
always wins. He retired to- the wilds of Mallacoota
(Vic.) a dozen years ago with acres of salt-sea and
other writing at the back of his mind, and most of
it is still there. Now, though he is retaining his
interests in Mallacoota, he has moved down to Mel-
bourne, to be nearer the market-place. And Litera-
ture will have to wait a few years longer—or learn
how to pay as well as, say, pork-butchering.
George Woolnough, M.A., for'many years editor
of Brisbane Telegraph, notched 89 the other day.
In his earlier years he was a parson, like his pre-
decessor in the chair, F. T. Brentnall, who is only
two or three years younger than Woolnough. The
latter was succeeded by Dr. “Whiskers” Ward, who
ip turn gave place to Tom Heney, late of the
S.M.H. Woolnough still has the scribbling habit,
and reels off literary articles of such profound depth
on obtuse subjects that anyone who gets to the
bottom of them is in danger of losing his breath be-
fore he reaches the top again.
“C.M.”: Boni and Liveright, the New York
publishers, have issued a brochure containing the
verbatim judgment of Judge Oberwager, who dis-
missed the charge laid against the firm bv the
Society for. the Suppression of Vice for publishing
“The Satyricon” with Norman Lindsay’s illustrations.
The final paragraph of the judgment should be of
interest to the professional censor of morals: —
“One who is not content with repressing scandalous
excesses, but demands austere piety, will soon dis-
cover that not only has the rendering of an impossible
service to the cause of virtue been attempted, but
that vice has been thereby aided.”
There were 1200 copies of this work of Petronius
printed, Norman Lindsay’s illustrations being pre-
sumably the chief attraction. Yet the artist was
not consulted in the enterprise, and has not eveD
received a complimentary copy.
“Centurion”: In writing of the Annandale (Syd.
ney) Johnstones, “Robert Hap” (B. 9/8/’23) says
that the family is “mentioned” in one of Scott’s
novels, the “Monastery.” It was not the Johnstones,
but that other great clan of Annandale, the Elliotts,
of whom Scott has much to say in the “Monastery.”
In the glorious days of which the Wizard wrote,
one could not throw a stone along Annan Water
without hitting a Johnstone, an Armstrong or an
El)iott. Few of thcfm ever died in their beds or
dined off their own beef. In the ’sixties, and earlier,
Victoria and Queensland got a strong reinforcement
from the Borders, and some of the old leaven worked
in the A.1.F..
“Rienzi”: An Australian black-and-white artist
recently had a sad encounter with a horse. The
draughtsman, who had been commissioned to visit a
roll-up of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals to get a couple of caricatures of officials,
collided with a friend’s birthday-party on the way,
and when he arrived to execute his mission he was
in a condition of mi 1 d jollity, which developed into
acute sentimentality as the tales of horror were un-
folded by the meeting. After getting his drawings
the artist started to brood on the awful lot of
animals in general, and in an excess of emotion he
embraced the nearest neddy and tried to kiss it on
the nose. But the beast, resenting the attention,
turned on the offender and bit his hat in two. After
which the unhappy caricaturist walked the main street
with his intellect protruding through a torn lid that
was settling down precariously over each ear.
“Vicar”: The distinction of being the first and
last and practically the only Sunday newspaper ever
published on the Westralian goldfields belongs to the
Kalgoorie Sun, which has just been celebrating its
25th birthday. J. McCallum Smith (now M.L.A.)
and Arthur Reid founded it in 1898, with a pre-
carious £5OO loaned for the purpose by the late
Zebina Lane, and for many a year it proved a lucra-
tive investment for everyone connected with it.
Indeed, it was with Sun profits that the proprietors
acquired the Perth Sunday Times from the widow
of F. C. B. Vosper in 1901, and developed a more
permanent proposition than the goldfields one. fine
first editor of the Sun was Walter O’Connor, who died
in Perth a few years ago. The second was Hugh
Mahon, who made the job a stepping-stone to the
House of Reps. Another ex-editor w T ho has since
attained some political distinction is Tommy Walker,
ex-Attorney of the State. “Smiler” Hales was an
early contributor, and in its heyday (which was Kal-
goorlie’s, too) the paper had regular versemakers of
more than ordinary talent in the late “Bluebush”
Bourke, Dorrie Doolette (“The Prodigal”) and “Cross-
cut” Wilson. Among black-and-whitars Dick Hartley
(now in U.S.A.) and Harry Cherry got their first
sketches printed in the Sun.
“Bildad”: Melbourne Age’s review of Walter Mur-
doch’s “Alfred Deakin” was not exactly cordial to-
wards that old and distinguished member of its staff.
Perhaps the biographer said too much of Deakin’s
influence on the Age and on David Syme, when he
might have spread himself more pleasingly about their
influence on Deakin. To imagine anybody influencing
David was akin, in the old Age days, to the idea of
a curate tendering advice to Buddha and getting a
respectful hearing. And in the latter part of his
career Deakin did at least one thing which was
hardly likely to be pleasing at his old office. That
was his action in arranging for the taking over of
the N. Territory, coupled with the proviso for a Port
Augusta-Darwin railway. It has been said that a
nation hates the State next door, and has a leaning
to the State next door but one, which helps to explain
the Franco-Russian friendship, and the tendency cf
Spain to dabble in intrigue with Germany. Anyhow,
all the influence the big Victorian paper cared to use
in the matter was in the direction of breaking the
terms of the compact with S. Australia. Incidentally,
it was Deakin, in his last Prime Ministership, who
ordered the building of the Australia, Sydney and
Melbourne, three ships with which this country gave
a fair account of itself in the Pacific when war broke
out, and which enabled it to say that it didn’t de-
pend wholly on Japanese defence. That was a strong
man’s work. The state of the navy now, like that of
the transcontinental railway, shows that Deakin’s sue?
cessof is still waited for.

The builders of the Wolseley have this idea in
mind—to build cars which shall prove triumphant
and give maximum satisfaction to their owners.
That they have achieved this ideal is proved by
the increasing number of Wolseley owners who
judge the merit of these cars by the service they
render.
Australian owners in all States enthusiastically
testify to the remarkable combination of desirable
qualities embodied in the Wolseley.
Whether the selection be a 1 0-1 5 or 20 h.p. Model
you have the assurance of
A Service Car,
An Economy Car,
A Comfort Car,
with a standard of reliability and road performance which is
unsurpassed.
Built of Vickers’ high-grade steels, endurance is assured in the
Wolseley.
Fitted with a lively engine, ensuring quick acceleration, flexibility
and smooth running. The output of power on rough tracks or
steep hills is a revelation, control is easy and speed exceeds
expectations.
The springing is an outstanding feature, eliminating vibration, ensur-
ing freedom from road shocks, and absorbing the jerks of travel
in a way that is surprising. Light on tyres and with low petrol
consumption, the Wolseley demands the attention of all who desire
a maximum-service car to meet every condition of travel.
The big reduction in the price of the Wolseley offers a splendid
opportunity for ownership.
Ask for a demonstration.

“The Faithful Heart,” at Sydney Opera
House, is that rather rare stagebird—rare
in these days, at least —a good play well
acted. On the unpromising foundation of
a ship’s officer’s amour with a port barmaid,
Monckton Hoffe (really Reaimy Monckton
lloffe-Miles) has built a dramatic story that
tugs at the audience’s heartstrings and makes
lumps come in its throat. There is a mother-
less consequence of the manoeuvre, which has
been forgotten by the seafaring gentleman,
after the seafaring fashion. She glides into
the picture when the author of her being,
now a Great War colonel in process of being
demobbed, is about to marry into a rich Tory
family, provided it ean be restrained from
insulting him with a marriage settlement.
He thereupon tells the lady of his choice
that she will have to accept the daughter,
as well as honored poverty or middle-class
obscurity, that being the price of his hand.
She is a good sort, but not so good as all
that, so she swishes her skirts out of the
Colonel’s flat, and out of the play, leaving
him to return to the sea, with the daughter
and his batman to bear him companee. There
is a maudlin touch here and there, but one
carries away the impression that the char-
acters are honest and human, the dialogue
clever, the situations effective.
In the part of the quixotic sailor-soldier
G. H. Mulcaster makes artistic use of the
considerable talents that Nature gave him.
He is a manly figure always, and there are
scenes in which he is finely convincing.
Beryl Bryant is the brave and unbitter bar-
maid, Sylvia Shaw the brisk young belle
who isn’t quite magnanimous enough, and
Eve Gray, whose acting noticeably improves,
hides her spun-gold hair under the daugh-
ter’s black wig. Satisfactory work is also
done by Nellie Mortyue, Bose Duggan,
George Bellamy, Eon Vernon, Douglas
Calderwood and Charles Road Night, the
last pair especially. And the humor and
pathos in the drab life of a decaying old
pub rouseabout are subtly revealed by Frank
Hawthorne —quite a masterly little char-
acter-study this.
"THE FAITHFUL HEART," AT
SYDNEY GRAND OPERA HOUSE.

Hugh McCrae goes to “The Beggar’s
Opera”: —
With an idea towards a complete restoration of
the period I drank coflee, at home, by candlelight,
and during the journey into town whistled “Lilli-
bullero.”
Recorded Sensations:
The attendant-women with their mob-caps.
Andrew MacCunn, through the shadow of the
orchestra, his features dimly indicated —much less
lit up than the intellectual hand, raising quaint
melodies to life by an expression of the fingers. It
filled me with amused happiness, when he touched
the keys of the harpsichord, to hear the music sing,
far away from him, like a gnat vibrating among
flowers with metallic petals. And Frank Quartly’s
replies upon the flute, or George Clearer’s humming
on his double bass.
I loved the old-fashioned stick-lights with a cut in
the sides to illuminate the written score; they were
so much in manner with the drop-curtain upon
which was painted Charing Cross as it appeared in
the 18th century, even to the equestrian statue
ballooning out of all proportion with the houses in
the neighborhood.
I had a child to keep me company on this even-
ing, and she said “Aupp!” (whatever aupp may
mean) when Charles Mettam, as Filch, slid out from
the wings, his hands extended, and exhibiting the
motion of a winder of invisible wool. The child
liked the way he spread his legs, and it seemed to
me a natural action, as of a man not yet quite
sure of his limbs being free of Newgate locks.
Mr. Cannot, seated above two steps, dressed in
what appeared to be a Canterbury Pilgrim costume,
and singing like the Deuce. We both admired his
voice, which we immediately knew (without having
to look under the gills) to be fresh; his face was
equally robust, and round and red. A contrast to
himself, his- wife, as sharp and jagged as a flesh-
hook. She was Hogarthian to the bone. She was
excellent. Ip her appearance, in her gestures and
intonation, Mrs. Peachum never dies.
The nice, kind, cruelly-used Polly, gazing wist-
fully under her cap; the gentle tone sounding, in
the songs, like the trills of a caged bird remember-
ing the wood. We all praised her, and the pretty
way she sank between her pannier-wings at the
beginning, and the end, of each lyric.
Beryl Walkeley has more eagerness, and when
she is singing the words strike through the air with
the flashing effect of the sun upon a fountain.
Cannot and Prince, caco-comedians (ca-eo on
account of their character, not of their acting), were
as funny as it is possible to be, and the fight,
wherein they mixed their wigs and hats, made every-
body merry for the evening.
But who that has seen the present production of
“The Beggar’s Opera” shall ever forget the magnifi-
cent Macheath of Howett Worster? A more perfect
portrayal of this particular part is out of imagina-
tion. The player we have seen becomes the Gentle-
man of the Road exactly after Mr. Gay’s own heart;
and his woman-eompellingness carries him further
than the stage—or, for that matter, further even
than the theatre itself. Watch him, and admire how,
when visited by wenches, he uses the word and ges-
ture in a manner exactly suited to their several
characters and temperaments. Observe how, upon
leaving each, he takes her with his eye, and finally _
holds the complete group gathered to him in a single
controlling gaze.
For eight nights more Gertrude Elliott
will sparkle at Sydney Criterion in “Enter,

Through,” which is as fragrant with romance
and sentiment as Martin-place with the scent
of violets in season.

“King Lear” was the Allan Wilkie offer-
ing on Saturday night, and Sydney Conserva
torium was crowded to see this very rarely
acted heavy tragedy. Wilkie proved a robust
and spacious old eurser, a man of mighty
wraths and devastating passions. It isn’t
to be wondered at that Goneril (Lorna
Forbes) and Regan (Irene Webb) had a bit
of the hell-cat in them. That their ingrati-
tude was colossal and past decency you may
allow ; on the other hand, the King’s lavish-
ness was out of all bounds. Many a
father, after Saturday night, may ponder
well over the idea that the strongest weapon
of an elderly parent with good investments
is will power. If that doesn’t keep bis
children and their children toeing the mark
nothing is likely to. Wilkie’s presentation
of the King was on strong lines, and the
Cordelia of Miss Hunter-Watts was a darling
thing in an apple-green lined cloak. Claude
Saunders, Plumpton Wilson and Leslie
Manners were others who gave good help.
On Saturday business will be done on the
Rialto, with Shylock making the incredible
bargain that led to all the trouble.
* ❖ :Ji
The Sydney Tivoli programme is a well-
balanced' affair, mostly of old friends. The
“Come on Red” trio, for whom the top-line
was prophesied after Ruby Norton’s
exit, find their position challenged by
the return of Herschel Henlere. That
barber-starving wizard continues to offer
tasty sandwiches made of some tin-can alley
composer between layers of Chopin and
Beethoven.
* s’: *
In “Rupert of Hentzau” the Piccadilly
holds the best of this week’s new Sydney
offerings of cinema jewels, paste, etc. At
the Lyceum, Tommy Meighan, with his apti-
tude for bad-boy-of-the-family roles, is break-
ing the XI Commandments with the deli-
beration of a pony-punter picking winners—
until Lila Lee comes along. “The Wall-
flower” is the fill-up. The Strand features a
worth-while-seeing picture in “Grumpy,”
with likeable old Theodore Roberts playing
the name-part. At the Globe Eve Novak is
the tempted in “Temptation.” The _ tape-
machine, sable-coats and a sly-grog raid are
the chief items of interest.
At other Melbourne houses other things
are about to happen ; only at the Palace is the
programme for next week the same as usual.
Amidst a foaming ocean of change, “Rockets”
stands like a rock. Relieved of the neigh-
boring presence of “Tangerine,” its long-
“HIS HOUSE IN ORDER,” AT
MELBOURNE KING'S.
“Dot” Boucicault as Hilary Jesson , and
Irene Vanbrugh as Nina.
time rival in irresponsibility, “Rockets” will
breathe more defiance to stern criticism than
ever, and shake its legs with more complete
abandon.
Melbourne Princess’s, as mentioned last
week, will, from Saturday, be temporarily
disguised as a picture-theatre. The ghost of
Douglas Fairbanks will do derring deeds on
a screen, while the orchestra helps to make
“Robin Hood” a record-breaker in photo-
plays.
* * * Sji
Silence reigns at Melbourne Royal save for
a sound of hammering by night, also a noise
of new gilding and profuse decoration, in
addition to the shrieks of carpets trodden
under foot for the first time. The Royal, in
short, is being done up in readiness for
“Sally” on the 18th instant.
“Sybil” passes from Melbourne Majesty’s
this Friday. On Saturday a revival of "Mu
iVlie Rosette” will come as a reminder that
the French comic operas of last century re-
main at the top of that class of entertain-
ment.
* * *
“Mr. Pim Passes By” has been a long
time coming after “His House in Order” at
Melbourne King’s, but he is promised for
certain this Saturday. The comedy is short-
weight for a full night’s entertainment, and
when it was staged here a year or two ago
“The Dumb and the Blind” served as a
curtain-raiser. The “extra” this time is to
be “The Twelve-pound Look,” by J. M.
Barrie.
** * *
Ada Reeve, for not the first or second
time in her career, is. giving a series of songs
at Melbourne Tivoli. Some of them are the
same old songs, and these seem to have more
punch tnan the new ones she introduced on
Saturday. All the same, it is hard to say
what Ada Reeve will make of a ditty when
she has dealt with it as nobody else can deal
with simple lines and easy melodies. The
new numbers sounded not more than pass-
able, but possibly a few grains of red pepper
and a pinch of pathos, or even bathos, will
enable the magnetic artist to “put them
over” with complete success. Her faithful

“Grumpy” is the leading feature of Hoyt’s
Melbourne screen this week, and the crafty
old citizen, who was originally played here
by Cyril Maude, is a very effective ghost
in the hands of Theodore Roberts. In “The
Leopardess,” on the same programme, Alice
Brady is a South Sea siren gaining beguile-
ment from local fashions. Scrutineers at
the Majestic have registered a unanimous
vote of confidence in an unusually capable
adaptation of Blackmore’s “Lorna Doone” —
the work of a man who thoroughly knows
his job. Snub Pollard’s alleged “mirth-
quake,” “Dig Up,” didn’t wreck this paper’s
seismograph, but as a humorist with some
ingratiating energy Snub isn’t the worst in
the world.
Carrie Haase’s Melbourne Playhouse
recital on Saturday night kept 'one won-
dering why this statuesque creature with
the golden voice and histrionic talent should
have been lost to the dramatic boards. The.
programme had been chosen to please ali
tastes, and the reeitress soon showed her
ability to cope with every phase. Her fine
womanly voice, with its arresting musical
timbre, got its best outing in the “Blue Bird”
scene, when she visualised the unborn child-
ren and the rest of the Kingdom of the
Future with almost startling realism. Hei
graceful poise and fine range of vocal in-
flections were brought into full play in
several Eastern poems, and not even Shelley
himself could have got more lyric beauty
out of “The Cloud” than she did.
At Melbourne Assembly Hall next week
an Italian tenor, Cavalier Giuseppe Giorgi,
will give three concerts. He will be assisted
by a valuable assortment of local talent,
vocal and instrumental.

The question “Is Melbourne musically
starved?” was answered in a loud negative
on Friday night, when the heavily-supple-
mented ’Varsity Orchestra played a fine pro-
gramme to a bare handful of people in the
Town Ilall. Still, the conductor, Joseph
North, courageously turned a blind eye to
the empty chairs, and proceeded to warm up
the chilly hall with the fire of his own en-
thusiasm. The vice-regal Forsters, who
know quite a lot about music, sat in a front
pen. Haydn’s “Surprise Symphony,” Grieg's
Holberg suite for the strings, Sibelius’s
“Valse Triste” and Hamish McCunn’s “Land
of Mountain and Flood” were the main
items, and each was cordially received by
the enthusiasts who fringed and dotted the
Sahara. The Junoesque Elsie Davies helped
with an impassioned rendering of “Brun-
hilde’s Battle Call” and “Ah, Perfida”
(Beethoven). There is just a chance that
“musically starved” Melbourne will make up
for Friday’s freeze by booking seats for the
second concert on September 28.
“Sally,” at Adelaide Royal, is going for
the long-distance local record as well as for
that of the cash-register. Josie Melville is
even more attractive on Second hearing, and
George Gee, with Grace Lavers, puts in some
good work in support. All the last part of
the show is a frank exploiting of costumes
which extort the feminine gasp of admira-
tion that means success. The King’s is just

“D.”: The rise to London fame of Letty
Lind, who died at 61 last week, marked, in
its own small way, the ending of a period.
Society was wearying of the restraints im-
posed by Victorianism, and the craze tor
skirt-dancing was one of the signs of it. In
the early ’nineties every fashionable young
woman who longed for publicity and imag-
ined she could caper about a stage. or
drawing-room as gracefully as any Gaiety
girl, took lessons from Letty Lind. The
family name was Rudge, and the girls, all of
whom comeded fairly and danced exquisitel),
took much less commonplace names —Lydia
Flopp, Adelaide Astor, and Australia’s own
Fan Dango. But the eldest, Letty, was the
genius of the bunch. In appearance she re-
sembled Genee, and at, her best, as in the
Cacliuca, with which she electrified London
30-odd years ago, she was the equal of the
French dancer.
“0.1 v.,” moved by a passing bell: —
News of Letty Lind’s death came as almost a
grief to playgoers whose memories date back to 1888.
In July of that year the first Gaiety Burlesque Co.
that Australia saw (there were two subsequent im-
portations) made its appearance at Melbourne
Princess’s. Letty Lind became one of its best
beloved. As one of the star dancers of the expen-
sive outfit her name w T as linked with that of Sylvia
Gray, and as a matter of fact Sylvia Gray, in her-
purely terpsiehorean capacity, was the more distin-
guished expert. She was the Genee of skirt dancing
at the time. But Letty Lind, from the start,
endeared herself to the new public by her winsome
personality, as well as by her dancing, and a Bul-
letin bard of the period (myself) wrote: —
Sylvia Gray is a lovely fav,
As lightsome as the wind,
And graceful as a fawn at play —
But so is Letty Lind.
Both sweet are they, ’tvvere hard to say
To which our faith is pinned:
Our fancy may be Sylvia Gray—
Or else ’tis Letty Lind.
This was when the burlesque was “Monte Cristo,
Junior,” with Nellie Farren and Fred Leslie in the
leading parts, Fanny .Marriott, Marion Hood, Charles
Danby and Fred Storey as chief supports, and the
late Fred Cambourne getting a show to score in a
minor part, a show he didn’t get in the next pro-
duction, “Miss Esmeralda.” It was then that Letty
Lind put Sylvia Gray’s nose out, of Australian joint
by playing a little part as prettily as she could
dance a solo. Tall, slender and demure-looking, she
had enough singing voice for the job. On her return
to England she became a favorite musical-comedy
actress, and her name was such a treasured memory
in Australia that when Fanny Dango came here, 20
years later, she was introduced as Letty Lind’s sister.
“Buz Fuz”: Letty Lind is the second of
a famous theatrical quintet to go over the
Divide. Her sister Millie died two or three
years ago. The survivors are Lydia Flopp,
Fan Dango Mackay (who recently lost her
husband) and Adelaide Astor. Adelaide mar-
ried Lawrence Grossmith’s brother George,
and became the mother of Ena Grossmith,
a clever little actress, who has already shone
in the London productions of “Scandal” and
"Tilly of Bloomsbury ,” When in Melbourne
with Fred Leslie and Nellie Farren Letty
aroused the warm admiration of a well-
known character, who bombarded her with
offers of marriage. Receiving no encourage-
ment, he finally declared his intention of
proving his disappointment by cutting his
throat on her doorstep. “That,” he said
tearfully, “will show you up.” “Yes, I know,”
Letty answered. “Blood will tell.”
“P.F.”: Passed out recently, the last of
the quartet of McMahon brothers. About
four years ago Jimmie, the eldest, went. A
twelvemonth afterwards Charlie succumbed
to pneumonia. .Joseph, who was doing well
in the picture business in MX., passed out
unexpectedly a little later. Now the last,
William, who has for years been on the staff,
of the Palace Theatre, fretted himself into
insomnia, which finished him. The
McMahons had some successes in the show
line—including- the earliest cinematograph
in Sydney—but their failures were many.
“Norbell”: The late Frank Harcourt had
a long spin with the Firm, and was a mem
ber of George Rignold’s company for rnany
years, taking such parts as the French
soldier in “Henry V.” A versatile mummer,
he played anything and everything, from
song-and-dance to heavy father. He was the
Jacob Swartz of the Dacres’ production of
“A Bunch of Violets,” and appeared in all
their pieces. Imtterly the old man had been
on the J.C.W. pension-roll.
Thoughts of an old playgoer:—
Nothing was less expected of jthe Vanbrugh-
Boucicault management in Melbourne than the produc-
tion of “Mr. Pirn” as one of its tr|imp cards. At
first glance it looks as though “Pim,” coming within
A BARE WIN.
WIFE: “I hope my costume is the nicest at the hall. All women are rivals, you know,
when it conies to clothes."
HUSBAND: “Yes, one certainly tries to oustrip the other."
easy distance of tlie time when Marie Tempest got
what money she could out of it, must be a tactical
mistake. But Marie didn’t squeeze much money
out of anything, and the publicity she gave to
Milne’s comedy may serve only to advertise it for
the other people’s season, which begins this week.
A bigger public than was attracted to the little
comedy in the first instance will go this time, whilst
the proportion of audience that remembers Marie
Tempest and Browne as the married pair will be
interested in the casting that places the male stai
in a different part from Browne’s. The “Mr. Pim”
character, with Boucicault playing, doubtless gets
more prominence than when Browne didn’t play it.
For that matter, Irene Vanbrugh’s interpretation of
the character of Olivia, the lady who fears that her
first husband is not as dead as he ought to be, is
bound to be different from Marie’s. No acting,
however, can make a convincing play out of an
essentially theatrical story. There’s no truth in
the “pathos” of the situation after muddle-headed
Pim has persuaded Olivia that she is an innocent
bigamist. She and her second husband discuss their
predicament with such humble and contrite hearts,
and sorrowful submission to “the law of God and
man,” as no married couples would ever be capable
of except in stage stories where they are consciously
talking for high moral effect. But is a convincing
story necessary in a play mainly humorous, like
“Mr. Pirn,” or wholly serious, like “His House in
Order”? A neat theatrical fiction, artistically pre-
sented, is the most that intelligent playgoers dare to
expect these musical-comedy times.
“Repertorian” : Gregan McMahon has for
a long time suffered from a throat. complaint,
the effects of which were becoming notice-
able in his speech; so the other day he went
off to a hospital. It appears that the plucky
Repertory director has so much grit in hi*
constitution that he actually made a material
deposit of it in his neck. Having been
X-rayed, a small stone was extracted —and
now he’ has no longer any fear of being
mistaken for a soda-water bottle when he
ejaculates “Once more into the breach, etc.
“The Deacon”: Australia will have at
least one typical show at the British Em-
pire Exhibition. Early next year. r>ud
McConville will leave with his buckjumping
outfit. It consists of 10 crack Australian
roughriders, a couple of lady experts at the
same game, and 40 'horses and bullocks.
There are some stiff hurdles to jump in con-
nection with the English quarantine laws,
but the difficulty may be overcome by
McConville providing liis own quarantine
within the precincts of his show, the ground
for which has already been secured in a
good position in the Australian Court.
After giving the show twice daily at the
Exhibition, he intends to torn- the British
Isles, after which the French are to have an
opportunity of seeing Australian horseman-
ship.
“Mancam”: I first saw “Romeo and Juliet”
at the Melb. Opera House in ’B4, when,
under George Rignold’s guidance, the tragedy
was presented with Henry Irving scenery
and etceteras imported for the occasion.
The beauty and ctiarm of that bygone pro-
duction remain with me after all these
.r ears. The other night I went to Sydney
Conservatorium to renew my acquaintance
w th the classic, now presented by the Allan
Wilkie Co., and at the door I met I rank
Spellin, for years the trusted storeman of
the Firm, who was there on business for
J.C.W. The meeting was a coincidence,
because Spellin was imported with that
Irving production of 40 years ago. He was
then the head mechanist, and has remained
doing good work for the Australian stage
ever since.
“Thersites”: Actors who reprove interjec-
tors from the stage always make themselves
absurd. George Rignold, astute in other
respects, was often guilty of such solecisms.
On the first night of “Joseph of Canaan”
(Rev. George Walters’s effort), when some-
one in the gallery advised a ribald god to
“lie down,” Rignold strode down to the
foots and shouted : “Take the law into your
own hands and pitch him out of the theatre.
In the bush flippant remarks from the audi-
ence are often resented by the struggling
stormer. I once saw Ned Duggan as the
stately Sir Geoffrey Champneys in Dur
Boys” tell a rude person in the bob seats that
if he didn’t shut up he, Duggan, would come
down and bash the bucolic stuffing out ot him.
‘‘And,” said the then robust Edmund, slap-
ping himself on the manly bosom, Ned Dug-
gan’s the man that can do it.” Then he
resumed his aristocratic hauteur as it no-
thing untoward had happened.
”E.F.”: Remembering what D’Alvarez
said in Australia about her God-giyen
voice” and the blasphemy of captious critics,
it is interesting to read a June notice ot the
songstress in London Referee :
Madame d’Alvarez was not in her best voice. She
was not always true to pitch, and frequently bioke
the melodic line by hasty breathing.
But to tell her she didn’t sing in tune when
she gave concerts in Melbourne was to dis-
play your awful ignorance and lack ot artis-
tic perception.
“Q. Ockney”: A man of remarkable
and varied talent was Herbert Trench,
who passed out at his Italian home
in July When Lord Howard d e Wal-
den took over the London Haymarket
in 1908 he appointed Trench director,
and the newcomer to Stageland gave a good
account of himself. He it was who intro-
duced Maeterlinck’s “Blue Bird to the Eng-
lish public, and the piece, of which every
manager had fought shy, scored a. briJhaDi
success. He eQualled this most artistic pro-
duction in his second offering, Ling Lirnr.
but playgoers did not respond to the Eng-
lish Sh'akspeare as they had done to the
Belgian. He also helped Maude to produce
“Bunty Fulls the Strings.” As a poet
Trench will be remembered for his Apollo
and the Seaman” and “Deirdre Wedded.”
“O’South”: Irving never lost an oppor-
tunity of scoring against Beerbohm Tree.
Wanting a horse for one of his productions,
he spoke to a stage-hand about it. “I know
the very one, S’Enry,” the man assureo
him. “Quiet as a mouse, an’ no vice or
nothin’ about him.” “Ah, Irving.
“Been on the stage before? All his life,
S’Henry. He’s played in ‘The Way of the
World,’ ‘Ridin’ to Win’ and ‘Skipped by the
Li°ht of the Moon,’ besides bein’ with Sir
Beerboom Tree in” “Ah,” Irving put
in “finite an act-or, I see. Quite an act-or.
“An’ Vs not afraid of the footlights, S Enn.
Never turns an ’air.” “Ah,” said Irving
again. “Quite an act-or. Quite an act-or.
“A very sootable hanimal, indeed, S Enrj.
'E never made a mistake, on’y once. It was
when he was playin’ right in front o Sir
Beerboom, and the pore beast forgot imself
“Ah,” Irving interrupted, and a
critic, too !”
“Columbine” : On an opening night at the
Sydney Criterion, Melba was in a box. Hugli
Ward was then a member of the Firm; and
Ward was clucking about the theatre, very
proud of his house-decorations, winen were
being admired for the first time. Pink anu
white was the basis of the scheme. Ana
what do you think, Dame Nellie?’ exclaimed
the manager, waving his hand towards the
Triumph of Art. “What do I thmx. re-
plied Melba. “Why, it’s exactly like the
inside of a fowl!”
“Hamfat”: In James Beattie Fitzgerald,
now dead some years, the Australian stage
had a character who was better than tne
Professor in Bernard Pshaw’s ‘‘Pygmalion
at divining the locality of people’s origin
by their dialects. Provided always they
came from Ireland. Whenever the show
arrived in a country township Fitz. wouid
make tracks for the Shamrock, the Harp ot
Erin or the Wexford Arms, and get into con-
versation with the boss. “Go on sphaking.
he would say; “ye come from ’’ And his
guess was nearly always correct. His proud
announcement, when wonderingly asked now
he knew, that h e was born in the same neigh-
borhood;. was worth many a bottle of whisky
to Fitz. He knew Ireland like a guide-
book ; but he nearly broke his heart when
he tried to name the home-village of a man
whom he discovered in the Donnybrook Inn
at Ilawera (M.L.), run, according to the
sign over the door, by one Murphy. It toon
seven whiskies to revive the actor when
the licensee explained that he had 3 USt
moved into the place, and that his name
wasn’t Murphy, but Moses. Fitz. paid for
the whiskies.
“T O I.”: Apropos Dolores Drummond
(B. 30/8/’23). For years Melbourne knew
her as Dolly Green. She did her best work
with George Fawcett (Rowe) at “the old
Matchbox”—the Princess’s, in Spring-street.
Her husband, Sprague, was a law clerk in
Cliancerv-lane; sometimes he used the name
Drummond. I knew G. V. Brooke and P
companies well, and I.have no recollection
of Dolly Green being one of his leading
ladies. Fanny Cathcart (Mrs. Robert Hen.
later Mrs. George Darrell) was GA.h.s
first leading lady. Then came. Ellen Mor-
tyn, who died young, and the ■ last in Mel-
bourne was Avonia Jones.
TOO MUCH MARRIED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
John Montmorency Ebgleston
And Miss Amelia Grey
Had played through many a record run
Out Piebrook and that way ;
John played the hero true and right,
Amelia played “opposite.”
They’d been in love two hundred times,
Were wed almost as oft.
The victim of a villain’s crimes,
Amelia fair and soft
Would turn to John when wrongs might hem
Her in. John always righted them.
In trailing gowns of virgin white
With blossoms on her head,
She to the one accustomed knight
Was orthodoxly wed
In “Olga’s Quest,” and “Dunstan’s Bride,”
And scores of other plays beside.
They married in “The World Gone Wrong”
And in “The Bailiff’s Crime,”
Sometimes as wealthy folks and strong,
Sometimes upon a dime;
But always ’twas Amelia’s fate
To wed her Johnnie soon or late.
Is it, then, strange, as some declare,
That, being so much wed,
Dear John forgot to marry her
In private life? Instead
They lived together minus rings
And oaths and bonds and such like things.

Get this new and better tyre
IMPORTANT improvements make the
new Goodyear Cord Tyre with the
bevelled All-Weather Tread especi-
ally desirable.
Here are several reasons why the new
Goodyear Cord Tyre with the bevelled
All-Weather Tread is the greatest tyre
Goodyear has ever made:
The new type tread on this tyre is made
from an improved rubber compound,
extraordinarily tough and long-wearing.
The powerful, clean-cut blocks of this
tread are reinforced at the base by heavy
rubber ribs, knitting the whole tread
design into a firmer unit, and resulting
in a smoother-running tyre.
The blocks which line the tread on either
side are bevelled at the outer edge,
relieving the carcass from vibration as
wear proceeds, and resulting in a more
even distribution of the load over the
body and a better seating of the tyre in
ruts, with consequent less strain in the
shoulders of the tyre.
This new tyre has a heavier and tougher
sidewall, assuring utmost resistance to
kerb and rut wear.
The more uniform pressure secured in
the double-moulded process by which it
is made ensures a better union between
the plies of the tyre body and between
the carcass and the tread.
In design, materials and workmanship
the tyre is representative of the highest
Goodyear standards.
If you are genuinely interested in tyre
economy you will want this smoother-
running, longer- wearing improved
Goodyear Cord Tyre.
Goodyear Cord Tyres are obtainable at Service Stations and Dealers everywhere.
Also Transmission and Conveyor Belting , Hose for all
purposes, Asbestos Sheet Packing and Rubber Heels.-

SilkHoso
%o longer a luxury
confined to the fortunate few?
CpRACTICALLY every discriminating, woman would prefer to wear Pure
Silk Hose, but in the past not every woman has been able to afford its
cost. To-day, this latter condition has ceased to exist, for in producing,
Sylh-Arto Hose, Bonds Chemists have once and for all bridg,ed the g,ap
between the natural feminine desire for Pure Silk Hose and the limited
purchasing, power of the averag,e feminine purse.
Yet even this does not tell the full story
of the service that Bond’s Chemists have
rendered to the feminine community, for
not only does SYLK-ARTO make available
the benefits of Pure Silk Hose .at a cost
over the counter that not long since would
have been considered impossibly low; but
its Capacity for Wear is such that
SYLK-ARTO actually represents MUCH
Greater Value, than its price would
seem to indicate.
SYLK-ARTO derives its truly remarkable
qualities and attractions from the special
thread used in its manufacture. c Uhe dis-
tinctive characteristic of this Thread, is
that it is a PURE SILK Thread, which,
at the same time, possesses the lustrous
sheen which is the most attractive feature
of the highest-grade artificial silk. It
is also capable of surviving a “breaking-
strain” test that would spell disaster to
ordinary Silk or Artificial Silk Thread ,
You will certainly decide that wearing Silk Hose every day is a luxury 0
YOU can afford, after experience of your first pair of “Sylk-Arto.

Dorothy’s Dilemma.
(By “PHLOX.”)
\ \ r HY ever don’t you bring him up
\\ to the scratch, Dorothy?”
“Oh, aunt, how can you talk
like that?”
“Well, my dear, one must be practical
these days. You’re the eldest of the family,
and you’ve never yet been engaged. There s
May and Edna married and Babs engaged,
and now that you have a nice man paying
you attention, you don’t do your part to-
wards leading up to a proposal. Don’t you
care for Jack Hutton?”
“Yes, aunt. I’m just crazy about him.
But I can’t ask him to marry me.”
“All the same, I do think you might give
him a little more encouragement. But who
knows? The spirit may move him to propose
at the dinner-dance at the Wentworth to-
morrow night. You must look your best,
Dorothy.”
“I only wish I was as lovely as Mrs.
Merton.”
“Mrs. Merton is very beautiful, but I don’t
know that she is the best companion for a
girl. I hear that all young men are iu
love with her. She’ll fascinate Jack Hutton,
if, you’re not careful. They say she was
the cause of Mary Fletcher’s engagement
being broken off.”
“Mere idle gossip, aunt. A woman can’t
help being fascinating.”
* * * *
The Wentworth Caf6 was all gaiety and
brightness; the softly-shaded lights throw-
ing a glamor over everything. In she
beginning of the evening, Dorothy had en-
joyed herself; now she felt that the sun
would never shine again for her. Jack
Hutton had taken Mrs. Merton into the
palm court, and appeared to be talking earn-
estly to her. After all, her aunt was right.
She was dangerous.
Before long, however, Mrs. Merton and
Jack Hutton returned to the ballroom. Jack
made for Dorothy, and proposed that he
should take her into the palm court and
show her the gold fish. Before she knew
where she was, Jack had taken her arm
and led her out.
With faltering voice he told her the old,
old tale, and he added, “If it hadn’t been
for Mrs. Merton, I would never have sum-
moned up the .courage to ask you. She said
that you are the sweetest girl she knows,
and that it would be a lucky man who got
you.”
They stayed in the palm court a long
while, talking as if the world existed only
for themselves. When Jack led her back
to the room she walked as if on air.
Next day Dorothy mused on all that had
happened. How wonderful it had been ! She
was so happy. There was, however, one
thing that troubled her and marred her
otherwise complete happiness. But she
could not confide in her aunt or her sisters;
they would only laugh. Happy thought—
Mrs. Merton would understand. She would
talk things over with her.
Mrs. Merton was in, in the maid said, and
would she mind stepping into her bedroom,
where she was just taking it easy and
resting?
Dorothy talked long of her engagement.
Then, after some hesitation, she mentioned
to Mrs. Merton that she wore false hair
over her ears, and she had always heard
that men detested women assisting nature
in that way. Jack would probably despise
her for it. “But what am I to do?” she
exclaimed with a sigh. “My hair is so thin
and scraggy that it would be impossible to
dress it in the fashion without using some
false hair. If I only had your hair, Mrs.
Merton! How glorious it looks falling
down!”
“My dear, any healthy Woman can have
good hair by looking after it.”
“I’m quite sure I would go to any trouble
if I thought I should ever have hair like
yours.”
“But you don’t need to go to a great deal
of trouble. All I do to keep mine luxuriant
and glossy is to shampoo it regularly with
Stallax. Usually, too, at the change of the
seasons I make a simple tonic at home. To
make the tonic I get from the chemist a
package of pure boranium, and mix it witn
half a pint of bay rum. I rub it well into
the scalp night and morning for a week or
two. You can’t beat boranium for restoring
dull and lifeless hair, and making healthy
hair more beautiful.”
“Will the stallax shampoo and the bora-
nium tonic make my hair thick enough to
do without ear muffs?”
“Certainly, my dear. After using the
stallax shampoo and boranium a few months
your hair will be beautifully thick and
glossy. You won’t need any ear muffs then.”
“Please forgive me, Mrs. Merton, if -1 ask
what that cream is that you are rubbing into
your face?”
“It’s mercolized wax, but I suppose you
know what wonderful stuff it is.”
“Indeed, I don’t.”
“Then I’d advise you to get a tin at once.
It’s the best possible cream for the com-
plexion, because it imperceptibly removes the
old, worn-out skin, and reveals the baby skin
underneath.”
“But does the young skin last?”
“Yes, if you use the wax regularly. You
know that in time the sun and wind dis-
color the skin, and you need to periodically
remove the discoloration.”
“Oh, it’s after six—l must be going. You
jhave been very helpful to me, dear Mrs.
Merton. But not a word, please, to my
people. I can’t thank you enouoh for help-
ing' me out of my dilemma.” — Advt.

PROGRESS OF THE C.F.P. INDUSTRY.
The new factory established by Cadbury-
Fry-Pascall Ltd., at Claremont, Tasmania,
“between the mountains and the sea,” as it
has happily been described, is now in full
operation, and the expectations of its
founders are in process of realisation in the
quality of the goods produced and the increas-
ing shipments to the mainland.
Only the two Cocoas most in demand,
“Bournville” and Fry’s “Homoeopathic,” have
so far been made there, and the quality and
flavor of these have never been surpassed.
In all goods manufactured at Claremont, the
requirements of the Pure Foods Acts are
kept strictly in view.
On the Confectionery side, Cadbury’s
Chocolates, Fry’s Chocolates and Pascall’s
Confectionery, made in Australia, are main-
taining their old British reputation, and
daily gaining increased appreciation.
Recent visitors to Hobart speak of the
unique. position of the new works, their
hygienic provisions and the charm of the
surroundings. A fine block in the centre of
the estate, allocated to recreation purposes,
is now being prepared for the usual popular
games. The old Military Hospital is being
recast for a Social Hall, with a Billiard
Room, Kitchen, etc.
Special terms are-to be offered to workers
to erect ■ their owfi homes, and it is hoped
these will be largely availed of. — Advt.

enough done H.B. (Junee) : Good idea; but
you’ll have to put more life into it to get it
through. .. .G.C. (Gisborne): Not attractive....
G. : Just an also-ran.... Bellerive: The fowl
with the wooden leg is a complete novelty
’Twas a grim operation,
But she suffered the shock
Which saved her poor head
From the ghastly block.
Two weeks in a crate,
And gently let out,
With a neat wooden leg
To hobble about.
Chuckled the hens and
The rooster did crow
When the problem she solved
To strut to and fro.
For grubs and soil-worms,
When out with the batch,
To aid the cripple
The rooster would scratch.

and lumpy... .P.J.S.: There isn’t the beginning,
middle or ending of a yarn there... .Jack N.: The
fooling is too heavy.... J.J.M.: Doesn’t strike u 5....
J.H.C.G.: That’s an easy way to fill out lines—-
stick in an extra pronoun or two whenever you are
a few syllables short G.T.C.: The attempt to get
mirth by using absurd words in every sentence would
spoil any yarn. Try writing some of it in English.
....Hilda E.: Neither climbs quite to the t0p....
H. : A steady tramp of all the commonplaces
that have worn out thousands of b00t5.... K.Y.
(W.A.) : The verse goes waddling on with odd feet
and an occasional flop Katoa: You put the case
with a fine directness, anyhow:—
Among all the evils that surround us to-day
There is one which stands out as clear as the day;
That is marriage, the barbarous practice of old
Which enslaves the timid ones and frightens the bold.
When people fall in love they to the altar .rush
And then there is all that society rubbish and gush;
Their children soon grow up and then they go and
do the same.
For that is the only way they can hand bn the name.
Now, why cannot all the nations agree to make new
laws
And wipe out all this rotten business of the marriage
clause ?
Free love could then be tried or any other plan
Which would not be such injustice to woman and
to man.
We know free love is not exactly a lawful combina-
tion,
But then what other way is there of meeting the
situation ?
Any new method is better, the old one is damnation.
....Donald T.: Ves, the sun will get up in the
morning; but you can’t claim to be the first to
guess it. . . .8.G.F.: Not much use trying if you
can’t say something fresher than that John R.:
Where it’s not commonplace it’s worse Onoto:
What have the roses done to deserve that?
G.J.R.: Bright, but can’t you make it a bit less
clumsy 1.... Sarto: The verse doesn’t carry it....
Roger E.: No use to u 5.... Burrawong: Nicely done;
but doesn’t get to anything J.B. (Kinkabilla) :
Not enough meat in your stew W.H.L.: “The
Poplar Trees” are rather tired... .D.P.K.: Not near.
Te Kuiti: The girl is not a descendant of Swin-
burne, whatever else she may be. The matter is hot

Every day the fame of Rexona grows,
until it is now world-wide. Most of all of
our noted theatrical artistes are Rexona
Girls, for they know how much personal
attractiveness adds to charm, and have
learned by experience that the use of
Rexona and Rexona Soap is the shortest
road to health and beauty.
Note what these famous Stars say of Rexona and Rexona Soap, and if you are
not already a user of the Rexona Products start their use to-day. Rexona will keep
your skin in perfect condition, and free from all blemishes. Rexona Soap gives
natural beauty to the skin and hair.
Girls! A Beautiful Skin
is a Joy For Ever.
There is nothing more beautiful than a perfect skin, clear, soft and healthy—that
is the kind of skin that compels admiration. If there are little rough places on your
skin that make your face look scaly after you powder, if your skin is colorless, sallow,
exceptionally oily, or of a coarse texture, the trouble can be easily remedied by using
Rexona Soap.
Rexona Soap is the ready aid to those in search of a beautiful skin. Simply use
Rexona Soap once or twice a day, and see if it does not quickly soothe and cleanse
the pores, remove the tendency to blotches, sallowness, oiliness and coarseness, and
leave the complexion clear, fresh and velvety.
No matter how particular you may be, Rexona Soap is sure to satisfy you, for it
is the aristocrat of Soaps, pure and free from dry chemicals, being medicated on the
same principle as the famous Rexona Ointment, which is famous throughout Australia
as the Rapid Healer.
Shampoo Your Hair
with Rexona Soap.
Girls! Do you know that there is no better treatment for the hair and scalp than
a shampoo with Rexona Soap? The reason for this.is that Rexona Soap not only tones
and brightens up the hair, but eradicates dandruff. Loss of hair is often caused by
the scalp drying, and losing its supply of moisture and nutrition, which causes loss of
hair. Whenever you see dandruff in your hair, it is evident that your scalp needs
attention as well as the hair.
Always wash your hair with Rexona Soap, and you will be astonished at the quick
results you get. If you are troubled to any great extent with dandruff, rub in a little
Rexona Ointment with the tips of the fingers at night and wash it out next morning
with Rexona Soap. Soon your scalp will be fresh and healthy, and your hair improved
almost beyond recognition.

thing I have ever tried before.’’

‘Adamascus”: In Queensland up to the
present time megass, i.e., sugar-cane debris,
has been used solely for- fuel. Now it is
proposed to revive an old idea and convert
it into, celotex, an article possessing sound-
deadening and insulation properties, quite
equal to cork, and which may be used for
making refrigerating trucks, packing-cases,
etc. A factory is being built, and the Gov-
ernment has agreed to supply 15,000 tons
per annum frtnn the State mills.

“D.D.”: The absolute limit of mechanical
telegraphy in Australia, recently installed, is
the Morkram Printer, an American improve-
ment on the Murray Printer, to be worked
in conjunction with the newly-installed
Murray Multiplex. This machine automati-
cally types the messages directly on the
form, spaces the words, changes the lines
at the correct places, counts the message,
and feeds in a new form ready for the next
message. The telegraphist? For him, by
the look of things, it will soon be good-night.
“Two Seas”: “Donald D.’s” indictment
of much of the booze shipped to this coun-
try (B. 16/8/’23) reminds me that when
I was in France I visited Charente, where
a friend of mine was employed as foreign
correspondent in a distillery. He showed
me “brandy” beautifully got up in attrac-
tive labels and marked three star, which
was being shipped to Sydney at 20s. per
case f.o.b. He also showed me gold-topped
champagne labelled “Epernay” at the same
modest price. The shippers, of course, did
not send that class of purge out in their own
name. The basis of the “brandy” was raw
potato spirit. What the bubbly was com-
posed of the Lord only knows, but it fizzed
and sparkled like the real thing, and tasted
“near enough” to satisfy ’way-back bookies
and punters on a wet settling-night.
“Sturt”: A South Aus. winemaker, Leo
During, just back from Europe, has brought
a batch of wines to give local growers an
idea of what they have to compete with
there. The most notable new development
is in dry white wines from Spain, cheap
and good. Port and Madeira are names
which, under the new agreement, Australia
cannot claim for use in Europe, but “Aus-
tralian sherry,” for some unexplained reason,
may still be used as a title. Buring men
tioned that thousands of used sherry-casks
are sent every year from Spain to Scotland
for 'the storing of whisky, which is supposed
to get an unequalled flavor that way. By
the way, local experts are agreed that the
past dry summer in S.A. was perfect for
port, of which the 1923 vintage is expected
to be long remembered as the best-flavored
on record.
* * * *
“Bareoo”: The motor-lorry of from three
to five tons has come to stay in the wool-
carrying industry on the far-western Downs
country of Western Bananaland. Drought
conditions in the Longreaeh and Winton dis-
tricts cause long stretches without water, as
well as areas of 30 to 50 miles barren of
grass, making it practically impossible to
utilise the old-time horse- and bullock-teams.
The brown-soil plains of the tableland, which
reach away from the railheads at Winton
and Longreaeh for hundreds of miles, are
ideal for motor-traction, and at the present
time the lorry-owner is making hay while
the sun shines, having almost a monopoly of
the shifting of the huge wool-harvest that is
being gathered on all the big stations. He
does not dally by the way: if the wool is
coming off fast enough the old ’bus is driven
along at its top day and night—the drivers
always have an attendant, and in a few
days the offsider can handle the wheel while
all is plain sailing, and usually does it with
more “dog” than the boss. While one is at
the wheel the other is sleeping on top of
the load ; and the only rest the engine gets
in the 24 hours is while the waggon is being
loaded and unloaded. The scoff of derision
that met the mention of a motor-driven lorry
on the far-western plains is no longer heard,
and valuable clips, instead of being stranded
at different woolsheds over large areas, are
transported to the railway centres imme-
diately the sheep are shorn.
THE EGOISTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Eggs, which but for the dock strike would have
been in the English market, are being used with
devastating effect at the Irish elections.” — Cable.
To English breakfast-tables they’d have found
Their way, these eggs, beyond a shade of doubt,
If only dockers hadn’t dog-hooks downed.
And what Ould Erin would have done without
This means to register dissent profound
From candidates that on the hustings spout
The Devil only knows. God bless the strike!
(Hurroo! you found the target that time, Mike.)
These fragile missiles through the air that fly
At Thady Callaghan (blandandering thief!
If I could only plug him in the eye
From his inanities we’d have relief) —
They might have made the Sassenach a pie
Or helped the Yorkshire pudding for his beef.
A dismal destiny for ammunition
So handy to suppress a politician!
These “fine new-laids” so gleefully we slam
At gentlemen who come to beg /a vote
Might have been keeping company with ham
In a procession down some London throat
But for our luck. (Fair in the diaphragm !
There, that will teach Muldoon to turn his coat—
Though even his opponents will allow
That inside-outing might improve it now.)
Let patriotic liens their eggs produce
From Waterford to Sligo, Meath to Clare,
But for the Briton’s culinary use
Till next our Dail meets we’ve none to spare.
(Who’s that at De Valera cutting loose?
The omadhaun. Give him a volley ! There!
He’ll hardly need, judged by his discomposure,
Another application of the closure.)
Sure, Heaven inspired them in the English docks
At such a juncture to put in their pegs.
'Jo stem the torrent of humana, vox
And make the speaker who is on his legs
Resume his seat, of all effective shocks
1 know of none comparable with eggs.
(See, Flanagan subsides in ignominy—
More power to your sturdy elbow, Dinny!)

R. PI. Chapman, lately lecturing at Syd-
ney ’Varsity, but now back at his old job
in the S.A. Railway Department, did some
fine technical work with the Royal Engineers
during the war. A treatise of his _on field-
guns was published by the British War
Office.
“Uramao”: Just celebrated its diamond
jubilee, Puhoi, 35 miles north of Auckland.
Four-score immigrants from Bohemia, with
Captain Krippner as leader, pitched their
tents there in 1863, and set out to subdue
the wilderness, with such effect that now
Puhoi presents a prosperous settlement of
well-tilled farms.
“Aroik” : The hamlet of Bergalia (South
Coast, N.S.W.) has one remarkable claim
to fame. A youngster there managed to
crawl into a 10-gallon milkcan, and as it
could neither turn round nor back out nor be
pulled out, its mother finally chopped the
bottom of the tin off with an axe —a feat
that called for about the limit in feminine
nerve.
“The Deacon”: The last direct Australian
link with poet James Clarence Mangin lias
been snapped by the death of James Mangin,
of Penrith (N.S.W.), aged 79. Unlike his
forthright sister Mary Dowling, who crossed
the River awhile back, and who accumulated
considerable cash from behind scratch, the
brother was a Dreaming John who always
spent with a poet’s prodigality.
“Pat Bushie”: Motoring from Cobar to
Wilcannia (N.S.W.) engine trouble delayed
me, and I made an all-night trip of it. At
4 a.m., with about 50 miles stilkito go, I
came to a Ford car, apparently bogged, and
looking as if it had been there a couple of
days. Sleeping in it was a weary-looking
person. “Better come along with me,” I sug-
gested, waking him. “Aw, whatcher want at
this time o’ night?” he demanded. “Why
can’t yer let a man sleep?” And he dozed off
again.
“Ashmead”: A reminder of olden times
was fished up the other day when the dredge
Ponrabbel, which has smashed away 20ft.
of the Porpoise Rock, near the mouth of the
Tamar, produced the gun of the old steamer
Nelson, which tried to skim the top off the
rock and came off second-best some 33 years
ago. When privateering went out of fashion
the cannon was used for signalling. It is of
solid gunmetal, weighs about lcwt., and
threw a 101 b. ball. It was mounted on a
carriage made of teak, which has withstood
the attacks of the teredo-borer wonderfully.
Some museum will get it as a historical relic.
“Val”: In official circles in Brisbane
there is no more familiar figure than the
chief messenger of the Home Department,
shown in the Blue Book as Thomas Mulcahy,
but known to the general public merely as
“Tom.” A letter arrived from South America
addressed “Tom, Brisbane,” and it went as
a matter of course to Mulcahy, chief mes-
senger. It was from a former Brisbane resi-
dent. That was 10 years ago. The other
day another communication arrived from
foreign parts addressed “Tom, Home Secre-
tary’s Department, Brisbane.” The right
man got it.
“McNorth”: The first Australian fruit-
exporter who makes a study of the art and
science of packing for overseas markets on
an extensive scale ought to coin money. Re-
cently some pineapples shipped at Brisbane
arrived in London in absolutely perfect con-
dition and brought 12s. 6d. each wholesale.
They had been packed by a Chinaman who
knew his business. A consignment _of Tas.
apples, similarly handled before consignment,
brought twice the usual Covent Garden
price. Some N.S.W. oranges I saw in Lon-
don lately were the finest, most expensive
and most sought things on the stalls. I
learned that they were part of a trial ship-
ment sent by a man intent on discovering
what could be done in the way of special
packing. The old method of heaving fruit
into a box won’t do. Careful_ selection,
cotton-wool, sawdust and exact chilling tem-
peratures were main features of these suc-
cessful shipments.
“F. Clinton”: When Frank Lions was
awarded the Science Research and John
Coutts Scholarship from Sydney /’Varsity
and the 1851 Exhibition Science Research
Scholarship to Victoria University, Man-
chester, Sydney High School added an-
other feather to its much-adorned cap. It
already has four Rhodes scholars to its credit
—Southee (now principal at Ilawkesbury),
Kershaw, Wheen and Watt. Last year
Shipp won the Cooper Travelling Scholar-
ship and is now at Cambridge. Prof. Todd,
Prof. S. 11. Dettman (Sydney Grammar School
, “head”), Prof. Eliot Grafton Smith, Federal
Treasurer Earle Page, and Minister for De-
fence E. K. Bowden are all old boys. And
the tradition still holds good. Last year on
entering the ’Varsity I. Henning collected
the Lithgow Scholarship for Modern Lan-
guages ; and A. H. Pelham the Bowman Cam-
eron Scholarship for General Proficiency, the
John West and Graham prize medals, and
halved the Cooper Scholarship for Classics.
“Two Seas” files a complaint:—
Both lawyers’ fees and stamp duties on the trans-
fer of land have been increased in N. S. Wales,
and the good Lord knows they were high enough
before. The legal brigade based its claim for
more remuneration upon the increased cost of
living. But the primary producer has also to pay
the increased cost of living, and 200 per cent, more
for everything he uses in his business. Nor can he
pass it on to the consumer. He has to take what
he can get in. the open market for all he produces.
As for his outgoings, in the matter of legal docu-
ments he is forced to pay for something he doesn’t
really require, merely because the lawyers’ union
is powerful enough to frame laws that force a buyer
or seller of land to employ him. A farmer may
buy a thousand cattle without the law-shark getting
a copper out of the deal; but he can’t buy one
acre of land' without paying toll. Why shouldn’t
the sale or purchase of land be as simple a matter
as the sale or purchase of livestock? The writer
knows of one little farm that has been sold and
re-sold so often that £2OO has been added to the
price of it for which there is nothing to show but
a roll of parchment. Before the increase of legal
fees was granted I bought five acres of earth at £3
per acre, and after the transfer was completed was
offered £5 per acre. Had the acres been bullocks, I
would have jumped at the offer; being land I had to
decline because the cost of transfer had very nearly
doubled what I had paid originally.

She Does Her Work in
Half the Time.
She wasn’t really ill.
But she never felt quite up
to the mark. Very little
exertion tired her out,
nearly every day brought
its headache, and house-
work was a long, dreary
drudge that never seemed
to be finished. She was
just “out of sorts.’’
Then, on the advice of her
sister, she started the
Kruschen habit.
Every morning in her
breakfast cup of tea she
took a tiny dose of Krus-
chen Salts —just as much
as would cover a sixpence.
After a few mornings she
began to feel better, more
full of life and “vim.’’
Now she never knows
what it is to have a head-
ache, is always fresh and
smiling, strong and well
from first thing in the
morning till late at night.
She really enjoys her daily
tasks, and says that she
can do her work in half the
time.
What Kruschen Salts did
for her they will do for
you. That feeling of tired-
ness, of inability to cope
with the job before you, is
almost entirely a matter
of your internal system.
Your liver and kidneys are
not working as they
should, with the result
that poisonous waste mat-
ter is clogging the machine
and impurities are collect-
ing in the blood. Krus-
chen prevents that, and at
the same time tones up
and invigorates the whole
system, making you
healthier, happier, brisker,
more efficient in every
way.
You owe it to yourself to
start the Kruschen habit
at once. You will soon feel
a different person alto-
gether. The color will re-
turn to your cheeks, the
brightness to your eyes
and all those lines that
worry has brought to you:
face will disappear.
It only costs you a farthing
a day to acquire and keep
“the Kruschen feeling.”
Start the habit now.
'O.
n
Tasteless in Tea
Put as much in each
breakfast cup as will
lie on a sixpence. It’s
the little daily doss
that does it.
I&fjjts
The dose of a sixpenceful taken
every morning is found in practice to
be just the right amount for a most
invigorating daily tonic. The medi-
cinal dose for persons suffering from
pains of rheumatism and gout, or
habitual constipation, with inactive
liver, etc., is half to one teaspoonful
in a tumbler of hot water before
breakfast.
Every chemist sells Kruschen
Salts. Each bottle contains 96
morning sixpencefuls—enough to
last three months. Get a bottle to-
day.

Brute-Royal.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
is his birthday, that wild son of
ours.
I wonder where he roves, in what wild
wood
He makes his lair for love and fatherhood,
By what clear stream, beneath what dewy
bowers.
It was a noon like this, of drooping flowers,
Still airs and cloudy piled up like mountain
towers
That held the levin-hearted bolt unhurled,
Threatening a dreadful and expectant world.
This is his birthday—the same day returned
In mocking power, foreboding and morose,
With oven-heat and stupid airs jammed
close,
And waters to a dull red copper turned.
Even the sea by baneful fire is burned
Where the low tide by the edged reef is
churned.
Blood upon earth, the sea, the bloated skies!
A stain too in your smouldering, bloodshot
eyes.
Born on the velvet earth, washed in a pond,
First suckled where the crutching boughs
were floored
With many a crude, stone-hewn, fire-
blackened board,
Shaded by drooping branch and thatching
frond,'
Held in the vine’s close-interweaving bond,
Latticed by leaves, with winds for nurses
fond,
.He learned the bird-calls, mocked the hoot-
ing owl
And the moon-serenading jackal’s howl.
He would have been a chieftain of the wild,
Fierce with the spear and sudden with the
bow,
Strong to deliver the skull-crushing blow,
Our lieavy-maned and hairy-breasted child.
Not even sleep could make his visage mild;
He snarled in pleasure even as he smiled.
He grew that wolf-cub that my loins
designed,
In lope, in fang and in ferocious mind.
Marama, fond were we —our meal of oats
Ground in the bowl of stone, and tender
shoots
Of the curled, delicate fern, with flour of
roots,
Wild apples, ruddy-cheeked, and milk of
goats—
Returning through the noon, though no bird-
notes
Thrilled through the air from magical sweet
throats,
For our two hearts kept up a fearless, rhyme,
Pulse tuned to pulse in fond, fantastic time.
As come the parent eagles to the rock
’Twixt earth and cloud to find the eyrie-
ledge
Upon the sheer, smooth precipice’s edge,
Bare as the few bleached bones that mutely
mock
The spoilers of the innocent valley flock,
And send a shivering sorrow to unlock
Their strident throats, spoilers despoiled
were we,
Brooding on murder in that noon-struck tree.
Once at a night fire on a caverned hill,
Famished by searching and the gnaw of
care,
We saw his foster-folk, in the red glare,
Feast him on juicy meats from the hot grill,
And moaned for him more than the plenteous
kill
On which he gorged, unconscious, to his fill,
Of our two shades, ribbing the flame-splashed
dark,
Like luminous bands breast-high on ebony
bark.
Still must be he a killer of men-folk—
Not only of our forest kith and kin —
Wooing' the cave-maid of the lighter skin,
Matching the cave-man with his shattering
stroke,
When blood makes red the very cavern smoke,
Until she bends her head into the yoke,
Won by brute might; and she shall bear
to him
Killers, his like in matchless thew and limb.
This is his birthday, come with fresh affright.
Marama, we grow old, while he is young,
Muttering and mouthing in the cave-man’s
tongue.
Deep in our flanks the gnawing-season’s bite.
Thunder, unyoke the Day and harness Night
To her swift team of Heaven-encircling light!
Hark to the mournful brutes! Yet none
can mourn
Like us for our own brute-man, royal-born!
MAORILAND.
DARIUS.
When the Tuchun Ruled.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Extraterritoriality, it’s a
fearsome word. But not nearly so
fearsome as were the cruelties prac-
tised upon offending foreigners in China be-
fore its inception. Briefly, it ■ implies the
right of a foreigner in China -to be tried
for a misdemeanor before a court presided
over by one of his own countrymen. Before
the inception of extraterritoriality he was
tried by a Chinese court, and the result was
a foregone conclusion. If the bow-knot didn’t
get the culprit it was only because death in
some other form got him first.
It would have been well for Frew, Harding
Frew, had he not gone to China until after
the declaration of extraterritoriality. But
Frew was in the vanguard of the concession-
mongers, and he paid the price. Imbued
with the idea that a white man can do as he
darn well pleases in a colored man’s country,
Frew did it. excusing his actions on the plea
that he had only three years in which to
finish his railway.
When the Eastern Development Company
secured the concession to build its railway it
was not altogether pleased with the three
years’ time limit. But it was the best the
concession-fixer could manage to screw out
of the wily Tuchun; and at worst it would
cost only another ten thousand yen if it were
not finished to time. It was up to the East-
ern Development Company, through its- con-
struction engineer, Frew, to see that it was
finished to time. But had Frew been present
at a certain interview between the Tuchun
and one Woo Loo he would not have set
about his task so light-heartedly.
Among the coolies of Shanghai Woo Loo
was an emperor. The longest, thinnest and
dirtiest of them all, he controlled the rabble
of the bazaars and the waterfront more
surely than emperor ever controlled his sub-
jects. To a man the coolies danced when
v\ r oo Loo pulled the strings.
Drawing his robes about him to avoid the
dirt as he entered Woo Loo’s hovel, the
Tuchun lost no time in coming to business.
“The foreign dog builds another railway,”
he said.
An opium-ash eater and a man of few
words, Woo Loo emptied a small phial of the
dross on to his tongue by way of reply.
“It must be finished within three years, or
the foreigner pays one hundred yen fine,”
continued Chung-Hi.
Woo remained silent.
“They will call for coolies within the
month. You have plenty of slow workers.”
Emptying a fresh phial on to his tongue,
Woo held his peace.
“Fifty of the yen shall be yours,” said the
Tuchun.
For the first time Woo showed an interest
in the proceedings. Extending his hand, he
spoke briefly and to the point.
“Five hundred yen.”
“Goddess of Boils!” cried Chung-Hi. “Five
hundred yen! And I get but one hundred,
and that only after waiting three years.”
“Seven hundred yen for the slow workers,”
said Woo imperturbably.
“Buddha! Seven hundred yen for the slow
workers! What would a live one cost?”
cried Chung-Hi.
“One thousand yen for the three hundred
slow workers,” said Woo.
“Blood of a dog!” cried the Tuchun. “The
salt duties this year have left me a poor
man. But take it! And may a boil come in
the palm of each of your hands.” ««*.
Casting a bag of money at Woo Loo’s feet,
Chung-Hi strode towards the door. “Be sure
they are very slow workers,” he said, as he
disappeared.
And very slow workers they were. When
at the end of three months, Frew had ex-
hausted an extensive vocabulary and his
patience in the effort to get his track down,
he gave it up and called on Woo Loo.
“You speak English ?"’ he asked, ignoring
the stool to which Woo motioned him.
“I understand,” said Woo.
“Well, I don’t like the sample of snail you
sent to build my railway,” said Frew. “Can
you give me three hundred others?”
“Coolie all li,” replied Woo.
“They’re not all li,” cried Frew. “They’re
all damn wrong. And I want you to change
them, quick.”
“Coolie all li. No better,” said Woo.
It was then Frew made his mistake.
“You’ve got to find better,” he blustered.
“Why, blast your yellow hide, I couldn’t
build the line in three hundred years, let
alone three, with the gang I’ve got.”
Taking up a bowl of ash from the low
table at his side Woo filled his phial, without
replying.
“All right, me lad,” cried Frew, shaking
his finger in Woo’s face. “I’ll keep the tor-
toises I’ve got. But I promise you I’ll
speed them up.”
Machinery to a Chinaman is like pure
water to a winebibber; he regards it with
grave suspicion. While Frew busied himself
writing urgent cables to his company, calling
for steam shovels and men to work them, the
Tuchun, hating Woo Loo because he had to
defer to him, paid him another visit.
“The foreigner has sent for machinery and
men,” he said.
Woo Loo made no reply.
“Thus will he finish his railway within
the three years.”
Taking up the ash bowl from the table,
Woo filled the little phial hanging on a dirty
string round his neck.
“One hundred yen will be yours if he is
not allowed to use them,” continued the
Tuchun.
“Two hundred yen,” said Woo, extending
his hand.
The Tuchun had learned his lesson. Tak-
ing a bag of money from beneath his robe, he
cast it at Woo’s feet. “May goats play
upon your grave!” he cried, hastening out
into the sunshine.
It was the riot following the arrival of
Frew’s steam shovels that gave the Tuchun
his chance. When, after smashing every
breakable part of the machinery, the yellow
men withdrew, one of their number lay dead
upon the ground, killed by the blow of a
pick-handle wielded by Frew’s own son. It
could not have fallen out better had Chung-
Hi planned it so. Like a vulture to a feast,
he hastened to the British Consul to demand
Ins pound of flesh.
“I can give no decision at present.” said
the Consul, after listening to Chung-Hi’s
demand for the surrender of the murderer.
"I must consult my Government. It’s a
terrible fuss to make over a single coolie.”
Putting on his best official manner, and
drawing himself to his full height, the
Tuchun replied: “You forget, sir, that he
was a man of China.”
The news staggered Frew. “Hell!” he
snarled. “Give up one of the salt of the
earth for a stinking Chow! And a damn
slow one at that.”
“Salt,” said the Consul, smiling wearily,
“is a Government monopoly in China. I’m
afraid we’ll have to give him up.”
As it had ever been in such cases, the trial
of Frew, junior, was but a mockery. In
quicker time than the meanest sneak-thief
native coolie would receive sentence, he was
condemned to death by starvation, and
cast into the Tuchun’s dungeons to expiate
his crime. Watching him day by day through
a secret slit in the wall, the Tuchun rubbed
his hands with satisfaction. By this one act
he would not only avenge himself upon the
trespassing foreigners whom he secretly
hated, but would also hold up the construc-
tion of the line and secure his ten thousand
yen.
As to the delay in the construction of the
line Chung-Hi was right. Like a man bereft,
Frew wandered aimlessly from his home to
the office of the Consul, while the implements

Home Again—with the
Same Old Backache!
Does every day bring the same old, nagging backache?
Do you rise in the morning lame and stiff? Drag
through the day with your back a dull, unceasing ache?
Evening find you “all played-out,” thinking only of a
little rest before to-morrow’s weary grind? Then don’t
be discouraged. Realise it’s merely a sign you haven’t
taken good care of yourself—been overworking and
haven’t had enough exercise, rest and sleep. This has
probably strained your kidneys. So, instead of worrying, just take things easier for awhile and
help the weakened kidneys with Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. Then, if it’s kidney backache,
you’ll soon get over it, and the headaches, dizziness, tired feelings and bladder troubles will go, too.
Doan’s have helped thousands and should help you. Ask your neighbor.
TWO INTERESTING CURES.
A MAN’S CASE.
Mr. Thomas Spence, Harriet Villa, Park Road, Auburn, says:—'“For yegrs I
was an engine-driver on the N.S.W. Railways, and for a long time prior to my
retirement suffered greatly with my kidneys. I think the constant exposure had
the effect of weakening these organs. The first warning I had of anything being
wrong was a pain, in the small of my back. This soon began to trouble me a good
deal, and I was often so bad that I could hardly move. I took medicine of all
kinds, but I got no better, and sometimes I used to wonder if ever I would be
free of the nagging ache. Well, to make a long story short, I at last got Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, and they soon fixed me up, a short course banishing the
ailment completely, and I have not suffered with my kidneys since.”
Four years later Mr. Spence says:—“l have had no return of my old complaint
since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me four years ago.”
A WOMAN’S CASE.
Mrs. J. Smith, Bonnie Doon, Duncan Street, Arncliffe, Sydney, says:—“My
kidneys were in a bad way for some time and I suffered terribly from
backache in consequence. I could not stoop freely ; in fact, all my movements
were handicapped owing to the nagging ache that used to catch me across the
kidneys. My rest at night was broken, and during the day I felt tired and
languid, having no energy for anything. I was advised to try Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills, so sent for some at once. They worked wonders in my case, giving
relief almost immediately and gradually effecting a complete cure. Six years
have elapsed since I used 'Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and I have been well
all that time.”
Five years later Mrs. Smith says:—“l still have great faith in Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills. I always keep a bottle in the house, and whenever I feel a
little off color take a few doses, and I am soon quite all right again.”

and material for the railway rusted under
the winter’s rain. Where lives the father
who could give his mind to sordid toil while
his son languished in the hands of yellow tor-
turers? Frew could not do it.
“Unless I hear from, or of, him soon, that
Government of ours is going to have an inter-
national question on its hands. I’ll get light
out of that precious Tuchun or let some into
him.” A score of times a day he said it, the
while the Consul buoyed him up with hopes
he knew to be vain.
While the events of the next twenty-four
hours can usually be safely forecasted in
most countries, it is the unexpected that
happens in China. One bitter wet night,
when Frew, junior, should have been dead a
week, Woo Loo was startled out of his
habitual composure—his door opened and
a gaunt, emaciated wreck of a man, and a
girl, entered on the toe of the wind. Jump-
ing to his feet, Woo looked questioningly
from one to the other.
“ We seek shelter,” said the girl simply.
In a flash Woo understood what had Hap-
pened.
“The harborer is held as guilty as the har-
bored,” he said, a peculiar light coming into
his eyes as he watched the girl.
“Would Woo Loo cast a humming-bird to
a spider?” asked the girl.
For reply Woo crossed the room, tilted
up the girl’s face on the tip of his finger,
ana regarded it for a long minute before
letting it drop, without comment.
“Is .Woo Loo afraid of the Tuchun?” de-
manded the girl impatiently.
Emptying a phial of ash on to his tongue
Woo stood lost in reverie,
f ' “Time walks, and the Tuchun moves as a
sv/ift horse gallops,” said the girl.
“Have you no father?” asked Woo sud-
denly, with seeming irrelevancy.
“My father and mother were slain when
the Tuchun took me, years ago,” was the
reply.
“And no brother?”
“Only this crazy white man,” said the girl,
indicating Frew, junior, who had stood silent'
and detached throughout the interview.
For a long time, while Frew, junior, stood
still as a statue and the girl stamped impati-
ently at his side, Woo Loo stood and mused.
When at length he moved it was to ; kick
away the stool on which he had been seated,
and lift a trap-door cunningly dug into the
earthen floor.
“Go -down there,” he said, standing aside
for them to enter.
Frew’s rescue from the clutches of the
Tuchun caused a sensation in Consular
circles in every treaty port of China. Such
a thing had never before happened to a white
man condemned for the murder of a native.
“But for the girl and Woo Loo, your son
would undoubtedly have lost his life,” said
the Consul, discussing the matter with Frew.
“Even now I can hardly believe he is alive.”
“Alive !” cried Frew. “Alive ! You’ve said
it. That’s all he is. The devil tortured
him until he’s practically insane. Kill a
man if the law says so ; yes. But torture!
I’ll have the dastard arrested and tried if it
costs me my last copper.”
“It’s no use,” said the Consul. “Where’s
your evidence?”
“Woo Loo knows all about it.”
“You don’t understand. For his own good
reasons Woo Loo helped you and rescued
your boy. But all the argument under
Heaven won’t induce him to bear witness
against a fellow-countryman in favor of a
foreigner.”
“But surely I am entitled to satisfaction!”
cried Frew indignantly. “The law should
cut both ways.”
“Satisfaction, I think, is in good hands,”
said the Consul. “There is talk in the
bazaars. Some 20 years ago, it appears, at
the Tuchun’s order a certain family was
wiped out, and its few miserable possessions
confiscated, A little girl of three or four
was spared and carried back to the Tuchun’s
house. But the father, so the tfile goes, was
not killed outright. He recbvered and
escaped, swearing to avenge himself some
day upon the Tuchun. That father was
Woo Loo. As uncrowned emperor of the
Shanghai rabble he has held the Tuchun in
the hollow of his hand for the last 10 years,
but he feared to strike until he found his
daughter. When, with your son in tow, the
storm brought her to him that night, he
burnt incense to his Joss and became a man
of action. It is to his determination to finish
with the Tuchun that your son owes his
escape. Even now, they say, Woo’s door is
bolted and barred on the inside, and the
rabble sits in the road licking its lips at
the noises issuing from within. Take my
advice, go on with your railway and leave
the Tuchun to Woo Loo. He has, I’ll war-
rant, a finer conception of the niceties of
revenge than the most diabolically-minded
white ever dreamt of.”
G. L. THOMAS.
The Casket.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was nearly eight years since I had
seen Bob, and the sight of his white
face. against the pillow came as a
shock. There was no trace of the healthy
fan that had once marked it, and his red-
dish moustache and the stubble of his chin
seemed incongruous and disorderly against
the background of starched linen. . They had
closed his eyes and crossed his, gnarled hands
on his chest; but those hands that had
always knit so firmly round an axe, a brush-
hook or some other kind of tool since he was
a boy looked curiously idle and empty now
there w T as nothing to hold.
“Bob was clean done,” they told me.
“Worked himself to a shadow. He always
carried the heavy end of 'the log, Bob did,
and hadn’t any strength left for the last
fight.”
The evidences of his work were visible
enough. The house stood oh a timbered hill,
but there were 30 acres cleared around it—
-10 in orchard and 20 in grass. It was
rugged country, and every inch of it had to
be conquered by brute strength. The timber
on the lower slopes looked particularly dour
and stubborn, and the sown grass in the pad-
docks had to make a running fight with
bracken and all sorts of other pests. Only
the toughest and wildest things grew will-
ingly in that niggardly soil.
The place seemed to fit Bob, though.
He had been built for a small, quiet fight
in a neglected corner, not for large adven-
tures in the limelight. There was a peasant
tenacity in his thick limbs and heavy shoul-
ders, as well as in his slow-working mind.
He rarely came to town, though his wife
was there often enough, keeping on the tail
of last year’s fashions with a pathetic sort
of earnestness. It had always been hard to
get Bob away from his cows, his tools and
his apple-trees. After a day with the axe
or the forest-devil he liked to have a single
pipe, a look at tte newspaper and so to bed.
Even the house had been built with his
own hands—those hands that were now
Closed so awkwardly on nothing. It was a
solid house made from seasoned timber,
chosen carefully at the mill three miles away.
On the verandah the boards were laid so
srnoothly that it would have been hard to
siip a penny between the cracks, and there
was no factory-made filigree-work along the
scantlings. Hardly a knot, either, in the
pine that lined the ceilings and the walls
inside. Altogether a substantial bit of
work. Everything had been fitted so accu-
rately that it looked qs if no nails were
needed, and the doors and windows moved
.cleanly in their sockets. It was a triumph
of good; hardwood, smooth pine and stolid
patience:—the patience of a man who loved
working with tough material. But, then,
toughness was Bob’s- own quality : it was no
wonder he sought it in the things about
him. Even the cowsheds and out-buildings
had the look of things that had been built
to last.
A hammering came from the back now,
and it was pleasant to think that Bob’s
.mates were making his coffin out of the good
timber he had loved. Not hardwood, per-
haps, bvjt cedar or heavy pine! There were
a dozen'"norses tied up at the fence, and a
group of men sat on their heels by the gate
talking in desultory fashion of dairy-cattle
and dogs. Soon they would nail the rough
boards over Bob’s face and carry him out
to some corner of the hillside he . had made
his own.
But no. There was a whispered command
to the little boy in the yard to put down
the hammer, and then a faint scurrying in
the passages.
“It’s come,” said a woman’s voice.
“Has it come?”
“Yes,- they’ve brought it from the train.
It’s here .now.”
The door of the bedroom opened, and a
small, sleek man appeared, looking round
him with the bright scrutiny of a bird. He
made a signal to an assistant, who inanoeu-
vered a long black object through the passage,
handling it with professional ease in spite
of its length... .They laid it on chairs beside
the bed, unscrewing the lid and placing ijt
against the wall.
“These porters don’t know how to handle
a casket,” said the first man frowning.
“They’re more used to milk-cans up here,
I should say.”
He looked at the object lovingly and wiped
a bit of dry mud off the corner. It was a
choice example of his art, made, appa-
rently, of papier mache or cardboard, and
covered with cheap black cloth. Rows of
braid were tacked along it, and little rosettes
of black beads, while inside it was lined with
white paper, edged with the same sort of
embroidery that gives a distinction to boxes
of good confectionery. •
“The • Beckman Funeral Parlors,” a card
on the handle discreetly announced, “arrange
high-class funerals in town or country at
reasonable terms.”
It did not take long to lift Bob into the
shell prepared for him. When that was
done the sleek man took some pins from
his mouth and fastened the paper,embroid-
ery across the top so that it hid the gnarled
hands. Then he rummaged in his pockets
and brought forth a medley of curious brass
ornaments for the lid. For a while there
was no sound save his stifled grunting as
he pushed the tacks in with his thumb.
“That’s all right,” he said at length.
“Now we’ll let the women have a last look.
They haven’t seen the casket.”
Was there an ironic smile on Bob’s face
as it appeared from the circle of frilled
paper? It almost seemed like it. His round
bullet head, with its red moustache and
stubbly chip, emerged from the tawdry cov-
ering like some old gum-tree rearing itself
above the pretentious growths of a subur-
ban garden.
We sat on the verandah and waited, the
sleek man looking mournfully at the leafless
apple-trees. From time to time he passed
a plump hand over his hair or took out his
watch.
“Ten acres 6f orchard, did you say?” he
asked abstractedly.
“About that. All the trees aren’t bearing
yet, though.”
“Good country,” he said, fixing his eye
on a wilted quince near the steps. “But
bad roads—wretchedly bad. I could have
brought the motor-hearse, otherwise, and
made a superior job of it. These porters
don’t know how to handle a casket.”
Bob’s wife came out sobbing, supported
by the other women, and the sleek man went
in with a mousey softness to screw down
the lid. There was a sureness about his
movements, a sober deftness as if Death
was a thing he was familiar with and yet
respected—an art that had its own tech-
nique.
“I’m glad I saw him like that,” said Bob’s
wife, drying her eyes. “He looked beautiful
—so peaceful and happy. I could hardly
believe it.”
The woman next to her made an effort to
express something appropriate.
“And it’s a beautiful casket,” she said
suddenly, with unction.
“Yes—beautiful. Poor Bob ! He’d always
been used to makeshift things all his life.
I wanted the best.”
There was a sound of shuffling feet in the
passage as the experts carried their handi-
work reverently out to the waggon that was
waiting.
