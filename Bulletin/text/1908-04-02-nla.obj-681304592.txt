THE RED PAGE
Old Age
rnWO curious discoveries have been
made by Elie Metchnikoff, the
famous bacteriologist who is now
at the head of the Pasteur Institute.
The first is that old age is precocious ;
the second that pessimism is a disease
confined to youth. His book, The Pro-
longation of Life (Heinemann) deals
pathologically with these two themes,
its chief aim being to discover the cause
of old age, with a view to its ameliora-
tion or even its cure.
In his previous work, The Nature of
Man, Metchnikoff credited the existence
of pessimism to the fact that man is out
of touch with himself; the human race
has inherited a constitution from remote
animal ancestors, and every-part of his
structure, physical, mental and emotional,
is a complex legacy of diverse elements.
And a number of these qualities, though
once useful to the race, are now out of
date, a,nd survive as harmful vestiges,
preventing the race from reaching its full
development. These clogging remnants
of past ages are the real evils of man’s
existence. Man appears to be but a
clumsy experiment, as yet far from com-
pletion, carrying within him disease, old
age and death. But Metchnikoff' is an
optimist, and asserts that ultimately
rational hygiene and preventive measures
will rid mankind of disease. As to old
age, he shows in this book that it comes
much sooner than it need, and that its
disabilities and miseries are for the most
part due to preventable causes. As for
death, the last evil—or good—Metchni-
koff holds out no hope that it can be pre-
vented, at least in regard to man with his
present physical structure ; but he shows
that in the vast majority of cases death is
not “natural,” but comes from accidental
and preventive causes. Ultimately, in
the course of man’s development, death
will come only at extreme old age ; and,
there, in its natural place at the end of
the normal cycle of life, it would be
accepted with cheerful resignation. In
fact, the instinct of life would be replaced
by an instinct of death. And with life
running its full and normal course,
Metchnikoff believes that pessimism would
disappear.
At the present stage of human develop-
ment it is evident that few of us sincerely
wish to live for a century. The disad-
vantages of old age are top great for con-
templation with equanimity. But Metch-
nikoff does not intend that a failing
old age should be prolonged; lie
means to shift the period of youth
further on, so that a man of seventy
would be as active and vigorous as a
man of forty-five. Thus one great
objection to an increase of old men—-the
necessity of providing for them by State
pension or private assistance—would not
prevail : the pension age would be cor-
respondingly raised. The other objec-
tion, that if men invariably lived to be
active centenarians, young men would
have to wait a weary time for dead men’s
shoes, Metchnikoff rather lamely meets
with the suggestion that:
Young men of twenty-one years of age
will no longer be thought mature or ready to
fulfil functions so difficult as taking a share
in public affairs. It is easily intelligible that
in the new conditions such modern idols as
universal suffrage, public opinion, and the
referendum, in which ignorant masses are
called on to decide questions which demand
varied and profound knowledge, will last no
longer than the old idols. The progress of
human knowledge will bring about the
replacement of such institutions by others,
in which applied morality will be controlled
by the really competent persons.
vt/
Metchnikoff finds the immediate cause
of senility in the atrophy of the bodily
organs due to the action of devouring
cells, which he has named macrophags.
In senile degeneration the nerve cells are
surrounded by nueronophags—a species
of macrophags—which absorb their con-
tents, and bring about atrophy. But
longevity can, like other characters use-
ful for the existence of the species, be
adapted to the conditions of existence,
and influenced by natural selection.
Metchnikoff was led to his inquiry by the
fact that mammals, as a rule, have shorter
lives than birds or reptiles; and he
therefore assumed that there was some-
thing in the structure of mammals which
has brought about an unnecessary shorten-
ing of the duration of their lives. This he
finds in the enormous development in
mammals of the large intestine,
“ which becomes a nidus for microbes
which produce fermentations and putre-
faction harmful to the organism.”
In order to avoid this putrefaction
brought about by the presence of
harmful microbes, Metchnikoff suggests
that starters for the centenarian race
should eat only cooked food and drink
only liquids that have been previously
boiled. But, in addition, you must im-
bibe large quantities of lactic acid, which
is fatal to the putrefactive microbes. Or
rather, you must ask the lady at the bar not
for lactic acid but for cultures of lactic
bacilli. Soured milk is the most common
of the foods containing lactic bacilli ; and
in Bulgaria, where centenarians are re-
markably common, despite the prevalence
of bombs, the Staple food is a soured milk
preparation. So, after you have boiled
your curdled skimmed milk, you must
gently sow in it pure cultures of the
“Bulgarian bacillus,” and then,if you can,
drink it, and, if you are not run over by
a motor-car, you may live to be a
hundred. The prospect does not seem
exhilarating. Metchnikoff himself lives
largely upon pure cultures of the Bul-
garian bacteria, and it is reported that
so far both Metchnikoff and the Bul-
garian bacilli are doing well. So much
for the cure of old age.
\\/
As to the cure of death, Metchnikoff
is not so hopeful. True, deatli is not
universal in the animal kingdom. There
are organisms that are really immortal,
unless killed by an accident.
Unicellar organisms (such as infusoria,
many other protozoa, and low plants) multi-
ply by simple division, the organism thus
giving rise to two new' organisms ; the
parent, so to speak, loses itself in its new
offspring without undergoing death. Weiss-
mann remarks that in cultures of infusoria
these little animals continually multiply by
division, and no dead bodies are found.
The individual life is short, but it ends not
in death but in transformation to new indi-
viduals. So if man had only adopted this
simple method of propagating his species by
each individual bisecting himself there would
have been no death in our species
—also no love. Trees, too, are generally
regarded by botanists as exempt from
natural death. Even trees several thou-
sands of years old are held to die only from
external accidents, Metchnikoff holds that
“ natural ” deatli—which in man is very rare
—is caused by an auto-intoxication, the pro-
duction of poisons within the body by the
product of organic activity—the macrophags.
Sleep, too, is probably caused by the same
agency.
It is the consciousness of the shortness
of human life that Metchnikoff considers
the most important factor in exciting
pessimism; but he adduces examples to
show that if the pessimist survives his
youth he develops into an optimist. Most
of the great pessimistic writers, such as
Buddha, Byron, Leopardi, and Schopen-
hauer were young men. Pessimism, like
measles, is a disease of the young ; and
in old age the virus dies, and is succeeded
by a serener spirit that sees in life more
good than evil.
“The Bulletin” Laurel Wreath
The office (tin) laurel wreath is getting
tired of hanging on its rusty nail. It would
be interesting to hear from critics which
one of our sturdy brood of bards has the best
claims for the Australasian poet-laureatship.
Correspondents should be brief in their advo-
cacy of their particular pet poet. Letters
must be addressed to the editor of this page.
All copy accepted will, of course, be paid for.

Munsey’s now publish a special Australian
edition minus its advertisements. And it
looks quite an emaciated Munseu.
Is Henry James, unknown to us, hiding
in Australia ? “An Angry Anthropologist ”
writes to Sydney Telegraph :
Upon the conclusion of an arduous and mono-
tonous journey from the extreme limits of Out-
back, I conducted a maternal connection, who, in
the few but well-filled leisure hours which the
pursuit of agriculture spares us in these, alas, un-
happily drought-stricken regions, is a devoted
(and I may add! capable student of the but-little-
knovvn science of “ anthropology ” to the museum.
It was my desire and intention to point out to
him the truly magnificent display of aboriginal
curiosities, of which, as I am well informed our
beautiful metropolis contains the most extensive
m the Southern Hemisphere.
then, I ask you, was my state of mind 9
What I repeat, my emotions, to find—the door
locked on the collection, and all modes of ingress
barred, and this department, in the words of an
official, closed for the space of one 12 months
against the public.
Inis is equalled only by a Roman gentleman
named “Pro Bono Publico,” who follows
with some information about Fleas.
The flea is the development of ages; his cursed
perfections are not the acquirement of a day. See
Hiffi^nl!t n?SSl, I i i Uaci u- lm a « ilifc y in «scape, the
difficulty in catching him, coupled with his cast-
mm structure, which too often prevents his
assassination when you actually have caught him
AH these qualities he has developed in a lone
course of ages in his conflicts with our ancestors,
who have doubtless done their best to crush and
exterminate him.
The Roman gentleman thereupon calls upon
Mr Wade to go forth and slay this doughty
antagonist of New South Wales

years of this, £BOOO in hard cash is thrown
at his head as a reward for ‘remarkable

How his admirers will explain matters re-1

What- Nobel would do if he were to arise
from the grave and learn the awful I
facts is too terrible to contemplate;
but it seems probable that he would N
hurl a large quantity of dynamite at j
the administrators of his will. The plain |
fact is that the individuals responsible for I
the awarding of the prizes have never yet 1
got into sympathy with Nobel’s desires. The L
result has been that the awards in the F|
‘ Peace ’ and ‘ Literature ’ sections have
been farcical to a degree. The ‘Peace’ Li
prize is to be awarded for ‘ the greatest ser- |
vice rendered to the cause of peace during |
the year. ’ 11 is quite obvious that the word |
‘ peace,’ as here used refers to universal peace |
as a policy for the whole world; and yet, 1
despite tins, the prize for 1906 was handed f
out to Roosevelt because he engineered the l
settlement of the Bear-Monkey scrap ? Pos- [
sibly, however, the committee that arrives rj
at these wonderful decisions is of a humor- |r
ous turn of mind. In 1902 the prize for il
‘ literature ’ went to Theodor Mommsen for [l
his Humisc-he Geschichte , a work in connection jrj
with Roman history ! For some inexplicable j
reason the committee considered this to be |
of an ‘ idealistic tendency,’ which was cer- F
tainly very rough on the historian.”
In England nearly ten thousand books |
(including pamphlets) were published in 190". |
This is over one thousand more than the |
output of the previous year. Excluding j!
reprints and new editions, there were 7701 i
really new books. A slight decrease in fic- |
tion occurred, for the new novels came out |
merely at the rate of five per day (including |
Sundays). The Australian author who ;
hopes to see his novel printed will
be cheered by the thought that on ;
the eventful day on which it at length j
appears, four other new novels will be
issued. That gives 4 hours 48 minutes for
its consideration by the reviewer, though ;
deducting, say, 12 hours for sleep, food, etc., j
the reviewer has less than two and a halt j
hours in which to read the book and write i
his criticism. Then he must sprint on to the
next. It does not seem fair to the reviewer.
Mooney Mike : Have discovered some
amazing physiological features in the papers
lately. One man was “shot in the ticke
box ” ; another was fatally shot “ through Ins ,
door ” ; still another “ received a fatal wound
in the window.” Quickest death of all was
his who “ was shot in the suburbs.’ 1 01
the general public the following facts wi
suffice :—“ He kissed her passionately upon
her reappearance ” ; “ Mr. Jones walked m
upon her invitation ” ; “she seated herse
upon his entering” ; “she sat down upon
her being asked”; “she fainted upon 11
departure.”

each Poem is printed on only one side of the
paper, and many of them stop at six lines,
the nice soft green leather book is beauti-
fully bumped out. As for the poems, the
author maintains an astonishing even level of
feeling and expression all through. Pre-
mising that all the items are of similar
quality, we quote three :
MATINS.
(To Lady D.)
Come,- —when the weary world is sleeping
And all around is still;
Come, —when the mists of morn are sweeping
Across the sun-lit hill;
Cothe, —when the winds of dawn are flinging
Whispers among the flowers ;
Come, —where the birds in the trees are singing
This little world is .ours.
A SYMPHONY IN D.
Dear little.head that nestles near,
Dear little heart that knows no fear,
Dear love-lit eyes with gaze divine,
Dear little, dear little love of mine.
Dear little arms that round me twine,
Dear little bosom that thrills to mine,
Dear little lips, so sweet, so true,
Delight of my life, I love but you.
KISSES.
(To M.)
Kiss me as the ripples kiss the shore,
Kiss me as the moonbeams kiss the sea,
Kiss me, little angel, o’er and o’er,
Kiss me, Love of mine ! kiss only me.
Kiss me as the flames oft kiss the fire,
Kiss with kisses burning like the sun,
Kiss with sltiinb’ring passion s wild desire,
Kiss me, Darling, till life’s days are done.
James W. Harbinson evidently wants a
lot. The author, it may lie added in extenu-
ation, forwarded the volume with a letter
explaining that “ perhaps, for some, it will
while away a weary half-hour.” In our case
it did.
And the office (tin) laurel wreath still
hangs idly on its rusty nail.

Exceptional Opportunities for our Readers.
’What is the cry that now goes up, that now rings from one end of the land to the
other, which is shouted demonstratively by employers and wailed in melancholy fashion
by employees ? Nothing less than Too old at forty.” And in nowise is this manifested
more greatly than in the increasing baldness and greyness which has afflicted humanity.
rake a hundred typical men and women of to-day, and what do you find—that nine-
tenths of these will show an alarming and significant extent of hair weakness and
deterioration!
Have you ever given a thought to the important fact that all such hair weakness finds
a responsive and echoing counterpart in the features. That the lack of nutrition and
vmlity which saps the hair growth has a parallel influence on the lines and looks of the face.
Take your typical bald-headed man—he has generally furrowed cheeks and brows !
Take your typical hair-weakened woman—she shows more wrinkles and marks of age on
her face than does her sister whose hair is full and natural.
Is there a way out ? ” Most undoubtedly; and that “ way out ”is now being placed
prominently before the British Public, for the proprietors of Edwards’ “ Harlene ”—the
most renowned, powerful, and celebrated hair restorer and stimulant ever produced—not
only assert that in Harlene ” will be found-the means of transforming weak, disordered,
stagnant hair growth into activity and health, but they back this assertion by offering a
special gift-bottle of this great hair-specific to everyone who acknowledges the need for
such help, for the purpose of a personal test.
„ Dignitaries from Royalty downwards have expressed their admiration of the efficacy
of Harlene.” and the perusal of the list of well-known names who have endorsed its
claims places it on a pedestal far above all other preparations.
Have you not the highest interest in vour personal appearance? Examine yourself,
and see if the fault is not in your hair. That is the “ weakness,” and in this free offer
is indicated the ‘ way out.”
When this special bo tie is finished you can procure your supplies from all chemists
and stores the world over.

Surges.
Like voices born of the night, and the turbulent
wind and sea,
Singing, singing, singing, the words of an endless
song !
You can hear them, out on the cliffs, in thunder-
ous melody
Beating over the rocks, ominous, rhythmic,
strong.
It is well that a man should hear the song that the
surges sing,
That his soul goes out to the sea, and echoes
that deep refrain ;
Till he finds there’s a chord in his heart—if it be
not an empty thing—
Responding yet to a note that is neither of joy
nor pain.
I 1 or the chant is not of the things that trouble the
souls of men—
Human delights and fears, doubt or pleasure or
dread—
But of deeps that are utterly deep, and of heights
that are past his ken ;
Of age that is numbered not when the suns
shall themselves be dead.
lis a note that rolls and exults, as immune from
the hand of Time ;
-Not thrall to decay and death, nor changed a
whit by the years ;
Not heeding organic things that had their birth
from its slime,
lor the sea is a god himself, germane and kin to
the spheres.
It is well that a man should hear the swell of the
strong salt seas;
The sweltering wash of the tide, thundering
loud and long;
The boom and crash of the surges inward borne on
the breeze,
Singing, singing, singing, the words of an end-
less song !

Hash.
In the dining-room the waitress who is pretty
does a mash,
While the demon in the kitchen mixes up the
daily hash.
Caring naught for those above,
Without pity—without love,
Does he boil and roast and bake,
Throwing gaily on the tire
Yesterday’s rejected steak,
And the beef which is as wire,
And the Things—the ancient Things !
That he fetches out and brings—
They are emptied with a splash
In the dim and awful hash,
In the palpitating, paralysing hash.
In the dining-room the customers are angry at
the waits,
Though the outlaws in the kitchen make a clatter
with the plates,
Taking ladlefuls of hash
With a lightning dip and splash
From the cauldron—how it steams J
How it bubbles ! how it smelleth
Where the kitchen fire gleams,
And the scent for ever dwelleth.
Ev’rything a man may chew
Is protesting in that stew,
Is demanding of the nose
Why yet once again it goes
To the tables where the feeders sit in rows.
Hear the terrifying rattle of the busy forks and
knives;
Hear the feeders say it’s better than the stuff made
by their wives,
While the ghosts of dinners dead
Sadly watch them eat instead
What the cook since Time began,
Thro’ the centuries has flourished,
In the teeth of beast and man,
Stuff that never could have nourished
Anything that walked or flew,
Or that had two teeth to chew ;
Yet the feeders blindly slash,
And ecstatically gnash,
When it bobs up renovated in the hash.
There’ll be weeping, there’ll be wailing, in the
kitchens underneath
When inspectors bar the fragment which shows
signs of many teeth ;
When they sternly wave aside
What the feeders once have tried
With strong jaws to masticate,
Making furious endeavor,
Chewing madly against Fate
What no blade on earth could sever.
But these fierce, intrepid souls
Now will sound the hash with poles,
And the eldest fragments take
With a lengthy garden rake
And disqualify the prehistoric steak.

purpose of inspecting the

With a good deal of un-
certainty. Only one motor-

r Premier Wade has
informed his party
that at the coming
conference of State
Premiers he intends to
stand by the big grain-

tion of defying the Australian
Government to make it any less.
The Bulletin suggests that when the
State Premiers meet, they should hold
a competition to see how big a bag of
wheat each Premier can carry up a
plank.

invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for “ copy.” Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official

WANTED, A SOCIETY FOR TRYING
TO REALISE THE GREATNESS OF
THE OPPORTUNITY.
Australia represents a condition of things of
which the world shows no parallel, and of which,
so far as history relates, it never has shown a
parallel. This is, geologically, the oldest of the
continents, which is something to begin with. It
was the last found of the continents, so far as
“ finding ” serves any practical purpose in history,
and it came into the world’s records at a time
when there was a vast accumulation of bad
examples—the worst kind of examples—by which
its rulers could profit. It is the only continent
which began its known history in peace, and
which has no battlefields as yet, and no gory
traditions. It is the only continent which has
never had a colored labor problem of any impor-
tance to deal with, save such as it might wilfully
make for its own undoing. It is the only
continent which started its known or written his-
tory with no land question on its hands, though it
has certainly contrived to make one for itself. It
is the furthest outlying post of the white man,
and the last visible chance, bar miracles, that the
white man has to build a great, homogeneous, new
and purely white nation. It is—most remarkable
of all—the only continent in the world’s records
inhabited by people of one race and one
language, and living peacefully under one
ruler. Neither Europe, Asia, Africa, nor
America has ever, so far as records go, shown
anything like it in this respect; lost continents
like Atlantis and Letnuria may have done so, but
they are mere myths or legends, and don’t count.
Australia is unique—in its political situation, its
racial possibilities, its history, its vegetation, its
marsupials, its ornithorhyncus—in fact, in almost
everything. It represents a stupendous oppor-
tunity conferred upon a race which is rather too
matter-of-fact to realise how great is the chance
that has come its way.

This very remarkable country is now struggling
with the problem of the foundation of a capital
and political centre. Here, again, its position is
unique. The city-that-is-to-be will Tie the only
one in all the world which is the political centre
of a whole continent. By reason of its possibilities,
the Australian capital—which some very ordinary
persons have just been looking for in a motor-car,
with mirth at the front of the vehicle and ginger-
beer behind, as if they were cheap humorists out
in search of a bad joke—should, in time, be greater
than London or Rome, It should outshine Con-
stantinople, and eclipse Delhi, and Calcutta, and
Samarcand, and Washington, and overshadow the
memories of Babylon, and make St. Petersburg
and Nineveh and Persepolis and Carthage mere
sundries and side issues. Rome put on consider-
able airs in its best days, but there were always
rival capitals in Europe and Asia and Africa,
where Cesar’s writ didn’t run, and where even
the biggest edict Rome could issue was powerless
to cause the arrest of so much as a drunk. Delhi
and Bagdad and Babylon ran huge spectacles in
their little hours of glory, but it is questionable if
one of them ever bossed a quarter of a continent all
told. Carthage was the capital of a very
small bit of the earth’s crust, and Alex-
andria much the same, and Venice even less.
Probably the city that got nearest to being the
capital of a continent was Mexico, when the early
Spanish viceroys held their court there, before the
United States were dreamt of, and while Montreal
CAN BERRA PLAIN.
The dry spot on which N.S.W. Premier Wade wants to plant the only city in all the world
which will be the capital of an entire continent.
and Quebec were still unbuilt. But, at its best,
Mexico only professed to be the capital of North
America, which is but half a continent; and even
there the Viceroy’s messenger was liable to be
scalped if he got as far north as what is now
Kansas, and lje stood a great chance of being fried
alive in Tennessee. So the capital of Australia
will be a world-marvel, inasmuch as it will fill a
place that no other capital has ever filled or is
ever likely to fill.
It is a pity that, when great things have to be
done, very small men often have the doing of them.
There has come to hand such an opportunity as
the globe never saw before, and the chance is put,
to a great extent, in the hands of Joe Cook and
Bruce Smith and little Kelly, and folk of that
class. It suggests an alderman leading a crusade,
or the Push going out to look for the Holy Grail.
The last great man who set out to create a great,
new city that was to be at once the political
centre and the population centre of a great State,
was Constantine, the builder of Constantinople
(such places as Ottawa and Washington hardly
count, for they were mere makeshifts, in-
tended as boarding houses
for politicians). And be-
tween Constantine laying
out Constantinople and Car-
ruthers crying out for
Canberra, there is a great
gulf. In all the vast mass
of literature that has been
published on the Australian
capital question it is difficult
to find a sign or semblance
of any realisation of the
greatness of the occasion.
There has been a superfluity
of yappings about imagin-
ary “State rights.” There
have been innumerable
wailings about the necessity
for having the capital as
near Sydney as possible, so
that it may be over-
shadowed and eaten up by
the superior State city,
and have no real life or
existence of its own. There
have been frantic appeals
to the people to rise up
and use their influence to
cut the Federal territory
as small as possible, and
thus make sure that the
only city in all the world
that is the political centre
of a whole continent will be
a mean little place, emi-
nently fitted to be the seat
of a little nigger monarch
with an upturned kerosene
tin for a throne. State poli-
ticians have tried to reduce
the question to something
smaller than a Little Bethel
row and something lower
than the shindy over the
presidency of a debating
society. The daily press has given unlimited
space to the “views” of Gregory Wade,
lawyer; and to the “claims” of Lake George;
and to the plaints of Lindon Biddulph,
crying out, like the pelican in the mud-hole,
for a tame capital that will feed out of the hand in
his own back yard at Lyndhurst; but the rights,
the claims, the dignity and the vast possible
future of Australia have been crowded out, so far
as the daily press is concerned. There wasn’t
room for them owing to the space taken up by
the suggestions of Alderman Smith, or the indig-
nant and ungrammatical protest of someone who
had found a mare’s nest in a suburban back street.
Australia might do worse on this occasion than
spend some of its timer and money in founding a
Society for Trying to Realise the Greatness of
the Opportunity. Australia has Shakspeare
societies which potter among dead men’s bones
seeking the true inwardness of the semi-colon that
Juliet used on the balcony in Verona. It
has Browning societies, and Theosophieal so-
cieties, and a branch of the British Israel
Identification Association. But it has no
Society for Trying to Realise the Greatness of the
Opportunity. In its schools and colleges the
rising generation spends a ridiculous amount of
its life stirring up the historical bones and dust o
Rome, Constantinople, Athens, Carthage, Sparta
Venice, Seleucia, Persepolis, Delhi, Corinth, and
all manner of cities that are dead for all
the intents and purposes of daily life. An
if the instructors of the rising generation were
told that the present scrimmage between Canberra
and Dalgety means more than all the ten of these
cities put together, they would pfobably laugh
the vacant laugh that is like the padding
of thorns under the billy on the Old Man
Plain. Yet this is a question of making
history, not of reading about it; it is
a matter of the bones that are alive, and clothed
with flesh, and walking about; not of those tnat
are dead and useless and entombed. Certainly
the question of the Australian capital is one ol the
matters that agitate politicians, and it is the
fashion of the superior person to sneer at politi-
cians while they are alive. When they are dead
it is different. Then the dust and skeletons and
tombstones of them are taught in schools and
colleges, and called history. The live politician
often deserves to be sneered at, yet, after all, Bill
Lyne did more good than Demosthenes ever did,
and there were more practical results about
Kingston than about Cicero (sometimes called
Kikero).
In fixing the capital of Australia the essential
is to make it a capital that is worthy of the occa-
sion. And the occasion is filled with greater possi-
bilities than London, Paris, Brussels, Berlin,
Madrid, Rome, Vienna, Constantinople, and Berne
put together, for even all that lot only
represents the capitals of half a continent,
and our problem concerns the capital of a whole
continent. The builders of Australia’s new city
should seek to so arrange things that it will be
strong for defence, and that it will have every
chance, by virtue of its position, its climate, its
liberal area, its abundance of water power, and
whatever other advantages can be found for it, to
become the greatest and finest of Australia’s cities,
and one of the greatest and finest that the world
can show. Their hope should be thatit will utterly
eclipse Sydney and Melbourne in beauty and ad-
vantages ; that it will be too good for Wade and
Bent even to be buried in ; and that the stranger
who comes here will be struck by amazement
when he sees it, and declare unanimously
THE SNOWY RIVER AT DALGETY.
The selected site for Australia's capital.
that the one city on earth which is the capi-
tal of a whole continent is also a city that
is worthy of its honor and its position. But, un-
fortunately, the Society for Trying to Realise the
Greatness of the Opportunity has a very small
membership as yet. The country is much afflicted
with petty State insects obsessed with the idea of
making the w'orld’s one continental capital a mere
collection of hovels, planted on some hopeless
place like Canberra—a dry plain on the back road
to nowhere. They have a horrible desire to make
it small and hopeless and mean, lest it should
overshadow the State centres where they creep
horizontally after their little State notoriety.
To them Australia is a foreign country and
an enemy, and anything that conduces to
its greatness makes them foam at the
mouth much as an old Roman did when any-
body mentioned Carthage. And the daily press is
also run mostly on insect lines. One may read in
it columns about the alleged “rights”of N.S \V
and the “claims” of this or that dust-hole,’and
the “views” of this or that tenth-rate local
celebrity, who wants the continental capital j U8 t
north-east of his hen-house. But if there ia one
daily paper that holds forth consistently about th e
rights and dignity and glory and future of Aus-
tralia, no copy of it comes to this office. The
Australian people should “ think in continents,’’
because they are the only people who have a whole
continent to think in. Unfortunately, the Aus-
tralian daily press mostly thinks in back-yards
Sometimes it doesn’t even get so far as that. Then
it thinks in sculleries—or even in coal scuttles.
THE STRIKE WEAPON.
The daily papers reporting the day-to-day
developments of the Sydney maritime strike, find
it necessary to record this and that “masterly
move ” on the part of the strikers. In truth, this
struggle is introducing to the notice of Australian
employers a new phase of industrial warfare. The
old strike was a familiar enough weapon; it repre-
sented generally the blind fury of strength,
mighty but applied with no brains. It
was blind Samson in the temple of
Charya, known to be stripped for mischief, and
with no Philistines, consequently, foolish enough
to guide his hands to the pillars. Samson some-
times won his point through the sheer terror
roused by his great strength ; more often he was
beaten through the exhaustion of his ill-discip-
lined struggles. The new strike—if employers
are determined to have strikes instead of arbitra-
tion —will be found a quite different matter. It
will be a strike in the first place of men whose re-
cently organised political activity has strengthened
their intelligence, and whose political successes
have tilled them with a new confidence of strength.
And it will be a strike led, not by humble officials,
but by men whose powers of organisation and of
diplomacy have been tried in the world of “high
politics,” and who have the mana of great political
success at their back. So the ranks will be of a
different type, and, more important, the leaders
will be of a different type. “An army of lions
led by asses” will no longer have any relevance as
a gibe. The mighty force of organised labor will,
in future, be used —if it has to be used in strikes—
with cute strategy.
* * * *
Consider the leader of the present maritime
strike, W. M. Hughes, subtle, resolute, ingenious,
with a must-win-somehow temperament. He has
personally triumphed over the most serious
obstacles until he rose to the position of second
member of a Commonwealth Ministry. Trained
as an organiser, as a politician, and as a barrister,
he would “lose” most men in Australia in a
negotiation or a contest of wits. And this man
the maritime workers will follow faithfully,
blindly, because they have so often known the
advantages of his methods in the past. Whilst in
the past all the “intellectual’’advantage used to be
with the employers in a strike struggle, it is more
than likely, in future Australian struggles, to
be with the employees. The knowledge
of men and their management that a big employer
gets is really not comparable for efficiency in an
industrial crisis with that of a cool-headed Labor
leader who has served an apprenticeship as an
organiser, has engineered several political cam-
paigns, has, perhaps, served in a ministry or two,
and has qualified as a lawyer or a journalist. The
generalship used to be all in favor of the masters;
the men had usually only the brute force of
numbers. In future both the generalship and the
force of numbers are most likely to be on the side
of the workers.
* * * *
That fact is stated without conscious prejudice,
and not with any idea of it having polemical
weight in the present dispute ; but as a truth well
worthy of deep consideration by the employers.
They have shown lately a decided impatience of
the Arbitration alternative to strikes; they have
talked, more or less openly, of their desire to
“have it out once and for all, and see who is
master.” It will be wise for them to carefully
calculate the forces they will have to
meet before inviting battle. Labor is now
so organised politically that it wields
a vast power in the government of the
country ; it has, on various occasions, won full
control of the administration, in the Federation and
in various of the States ; and it has acted on those
occasions with such wisdom and moderation as to
vastly strengthen public opinion in the reason-
ableness of its claims ; it has, by the existence of
“ preference-to-uniomsts ” clauses in different
Arbitration Acts familiarised the public with
the theory that unionists should not be ex-
pected to work side by side with non-
unionists ; and it has vastly raised the educa-
tional standard of its leaders. In every re-
spect Labor is an incomparably more formidable
fighting force in 1908 than in 1898. The fact that
it is also a wiser force, and, therefore, more reluc-
tant to draw the destructive strike sword, has no
pertinence to the present issue which is: Will
the employing classes be wise to force on another
era of industrial fighting by hostility to effective
arbitration ? It seems to The Bulletin that,
most emphatically, they will not.
PLAIN ENGLISH-
The Capital Site.
The Bulletin receives this indignant letter
As one who spent his boyhood days on the Duntroon
Estate of which Canberra forms part, I cannot allow the
misleading statements in your leader of the 19th inst. to
pass unchallenged. Why your persistent opposition to
Canberra and your hysterical advocacy of Dalgety ? Are
you sold body and soul, machinery and plant to Victoria.
Do you not recognise that by this Federal compact the
capital site must be in New South Wales, that is, it must
be essentially within the sphere of New South Wales in-
fluence, sentiment, commerce and of every other advantage
which the possession of a capital gives a State or country
as opposed to the disadvantages which the absence of
those essentials would mean when they were enjoyed by
another State or country ? Tub Bulletin knows as well
as I do that Dalgety is outside the sphere of New South
Wales influence, and is practically a Victorian district,
and if the people of this State foolishly consent to Dal-
gety or any other border town, village, or district being
selected as the Capital Site, then so surely as the waters
of the Snowy River flow to Victoria, so will all the advan-
tages which arise from the possession of the Capital flow
in the same direction. Again, Tun Bulletin claims that
it is run on straightforward and honorable lines-
Then why does it libel Canberra by publishing photo-
graphs of Dalgety and the Snowy River at its best
and the least attractive part of Canberra at its very
worst ? Tub Bulletin also writes of the desert plains ot
Canberra. Well, as the son of a late manager of the Dun-
troon estate, I can tell you from personal knowledge that
30 years ago the Duntroon wool sold for top prices in the
London market. Duntroon fat bullocks and sheep were
eagerly sought after both for quantity and quality, and
Duntroon horses, both hacks and carriage, were famed
in the Sydney and Indian horse bazaars as any old time
buyer can tell you. Surely the grazing land which pro-
duced these results is not a desert.—Yours truly, John
McLachlan.
To which hysterical outpouring of parish senti-
ment The Bulletin says these few words m
reply :
(1) The Bulletin is sold, body and soul, machinery and
plant, TO Australia— a place which Mr. John McLachlan


possibly never heard of; at least it isn’t mentioned even
once in his letter. In the early days of the Federal move-
ment, this paper advocated a capital in the Northern
Territory, in order to attract population to the place that
most of all requires to be garrisoned against possible
invasion. It was only when it became evident that the
choice of a capital was to be limited to N.S.W. that it
recommended Southern Monaro as being, within the
limitations fixed, the best place in the interests of Aus-
tralia the country that Mr. McLaciilan doesn’t seem to
have heard of, and which he never once mentions.
(2) As regards the statement that by the Federal com-
pact the capital site “ must be essentially within the
sphere of N.S.W. influence, sentiment, commerce, and of
every other advantage which the possession of a capital
gives a State or country,” this paper will give £lOO to any
hospital Mr. McLachlan likes to nominate if he can show
any words to that effect in the Constitution which was
submitted to the people. The statement represents an
outrageously cheeky process of manufacturing bogus
evidence.
(3) The statement that “ The Bulletin knows as well
as I do that Dalgety is outside the sphere of N.S.W.
influence and is practically a Victorian district ” is flat
invention. Dalgety is nearer to Sydney than to
Melbourne. It is close to a N.S.W. port, and a long
way from anything in Victoria that dimly resembles a
port. It is not far from a N.S.W. railway, and is a very
long distance from a Victorian one. Also it does its
trade with Sydney, as Mr. McLachlan doubtless knows.
If he had said that the adjacent Victorian county of
Croajingolong was outside the sphere of Victorian in-
fluence, and was practically a N.S.W. district, he might
have struck a patch of truth. Bonang and Bruthen in
Victoria drew’ much of their stores from Sydney even in
the days when border tariffs were in the way.
(4) The statement that if a Federal capital is established
beside the Snowy River with its own port at Twofold
Bay, “all the advantages ” will deliberately climb over
a huge mass of mountains to get into Victoria represents
a mental obsession that isn’t worth argument. It ranks
with the old belief in witches and ghosts and devils, and
such like. It is a pity to see a grown man uttering such
twaddle.
(5) As regards the alleged publishing of pictures of
Canberra at its worst and of Dalgety at its best : The
only pictures of Dalgety published in this paper
were taken within two days of the taking of
the pictures of Canberra. They would have been
taken on the same day if the ' photographer could
have been in two places at once. There was no
rain in the interval, therefore Dalgety had twm
more days to dry up in than Canberra, and thus it got
the worse chance of the two. The Oldest Inhabitant
accompanied The Bulletin man to the scene of action,
and lamented that the Snowy, as it rushed below Dalgety
bridge, was lower than it had been for 20 years/ As
regards the absurd charge of showing “ the least attrac-
tive part of Canberra’’—this paper’s pictures showed all
Canberra. Certainly it didn’t use a telesphoto lens on the
camera to bring into the picture things which, so far as
the naked eye goes, aren’t there. But that is another
matter.
(6) As to the prices of wool and horses from Duntroon
station 30 years ago (which is a long while ago), the
statements may be correct or they may be as unre-
liable as some of the others. Anyhow, they have
very little bearing on the case. There are some
mighty good horses in the Arabian desert, but that
doesn’t prove that the Arabian desert would make a good
capital site ; and there are quite a lot of places where
sheep are raised simply because the land is too poor for
agriculture. The Welsh mutton, which spends its life
hanging on to the side of a precipice, is quite famous.
In conclusion, The Bulletin urges its correspon-
dent to try to remember that there is such a place
as Australia, and to think of it a little. His letter
contains much about N.S.W. and a certain amount
about Victoria, but, as for the rights, claims and
interests of Australia, which is a lot more than
either Victoria or N.S.W., this native land of ours
might be Afghanistan for all the mention Mr.
John McLachlan makes of it. He talks off-
handedly about where “ the people of this State ”
(N.S.W.) will or will not allow the capital to be
fixed, but apparently the idea that the people of
Australia as a whole may want to do the fixing,
and that the majority of tiie Australian members
may decide the question, hasn’t struck him.
This paper urges Mr. John McLachlan to try to
“ think Australian.” The Bulletin has no land
or friends or interests either at Dalgety or Can-
berra; it isn’t even biassed by a sentimental
interest through having “spent its boyhood” on
Duntroon Estate, like Mr. McLachlan. It votes
for Dalgety chiefly because of its river, its water
power (which would make chief manufacturing
possible), and its adjacent port. If Mr.
McLachlan can find an equally good river and
port at Canberra, this paper is quite willing
to holler for Canberra. But apparently Mr.
McLachlan doesn’t trouble about details like
rivers, and water power and ports.
Another Protectionist Curse.
When considering the possibility of Australia
developing a great cycle and motor industry, The
Bulletin, some twelve months ago, pointed out
that neither of these industries was likely to hum
in Australia till some amendment was made in
the patent laws. An Australian who invents any-
thing can obtain, under the international patent
arrangement, no more than provisional protection
for a couple of years or so in the U.B. A., Germany,
France, Austria, and Russia. In all those
countries he is given a very limited space of time
in which to arrange for the local manufacture of
the patented article, and if he fails, his protection
fizzles out, and any foreigner can seize his rights,
and, later on, can actually compete with the Aus-
tralian maker in the country of the patent’s origin.
The other day Britain made one of those sudden
plunges with which the slow-moving country does
occasionally startle itself and the world,
and rushed an Act through Parliament providing
that no patent would hold good in the United
Kingdom unless the patentee manufactured his
article in the United Kingdom. Something like
consternation fell on foreign makers who had for
years been making a good thing by exporting
their notions, and Bull’s own notions, in
the finished manufactured state, to the home
of the Freetraders. Recently the cables told
that in consequence of the sweeping nature
of the new Act, scores of foreign firms are
opening establishments in Britain in order to pre-
serve their patent rights. This is High Protec-
tion of the most thorough kind, and when an
alleged Freetrade Government passes such a
measure, it indicates to what desperate extremes
the Freetraders are driven to dish the Tariff
Reformers, as the Protectionists in Britain are
called—even the Freetraders speak of the intro-
duction of Protection as Tariff Reform. The
Deakin Government is now at work on a
measure which will bring similar relief to
Australia, and, if it succeeds in getting any-
thing like the British measure into law,
the effect on Australian industries will be
tremendous. There are many profitable in-
dustries which are now impossible in the
Commonwealth, owing to the existence of patent
rights. In each of these industries it is essential
to use some patent article or articles. To dispense
with them would mean that the manufacture could
only be carried on in a crude way. and that the
goods turned out would be 50 years out of date.
The foreign owner of the patent Won’t, as a rule,
open a factory and make his article here or sell the
right to make it here, when he can make it under
his own eye in his own factory, and send the thing
here. Therefore, for want of a workable Patent
law, there are any number of manufactures which
even a high tariff couldn’t build up in Aus-
tralia. This wouldn’t mattermuch if other countries
treated us the same way, but they don’t. For
instance, much of the world’s best agricultural
machinery was invented in Australia, and if other
countries built their patent laws on the same fool
principles as our own, there would probably be
about 200,000 men employed here in making
harvesters and stump-jumping ploughs and the
lure for the outside world. But, instead of
that, foreign countries not only make their own
harvesters and stump-leaping ploughs, but export
them to Australia, amid the cheers of the local
foreign-lrader, to kill Australia’s own industry.
A rigid Patent law that will give this country a
fair deal among the nations is a matter of absolute
necessity, and the only kind of law that will fill
the bill is one which makes every patent in all the
world null and void, so far as Australia is con-
cerned, unless the holder thereof arranges, within
two years, to manufacture his article in Australia,
to produce it here in sufficient quantities to supply
the Commonwealth’s demands, and to sell it at a
price which will yield him no more than a fair
profit.
♦—
A Myth in Two Phases.
Illusions find it hard to live in a political atmo-
sphere. The Bulletin used to think that its
friend, Mr. Bruce Smith, apart from his pompous
stupidity and his ignorance of' Australian senti-
ment, was quite a pattern politician, in that he
had certain principles and was firm to uphold
them. That the principles were all wrong could
be fairly attributed to his learned stupidity ; that
they were upheld with some consistency spoke
well for his character. But, alas, alas, here is the
great Bruce Smith, on so important a question
as National Defence, veering about like a
shuttlecock, and committing himself to a yes-no,
which might almost bring the blush of shame to
the hardened cheek of G. Reid. In November,
1906, Bruce Smith saw the urgency of the defence
problem and believed in universal compulsory
service, and he wrote a signed article in The
Call that announced his faith. Bv 1908 G. Reid
(whose leadership, by the way, Bruce Smith
repudiates) and the Sydney daily papers had
settled on a policy of hostility to the universal
service scheme. That was the chance for Smith
(the undeplored absence of Pumpkin Smith from
politics allows us to shear the Bruce off now
without fear of confusion) to show his consistency,
his independence, his superiority to mere party
considerations. But he didn’t take the chance.
Instead, he crawled humbly in the rear of Reid
and the Telegraph, and said, just as emphatically
as he had before said “yes,” “no” to the National
Defence League policy. Let us put Smith in
parallel quotations :

It is a pretty bit of self-contradiction from a
gentleman who is alleged to have once described
himself to a public meeting as a “ thoughtful
statesman.”
In the Cause of Liberty.
Last week the daily papers in almost every Aus-
tralian city bought a pot of specially black ink,
and drew a deep breath, and then dashed on their
notice boards the heroic wprds “Fighting for a
Principle.” Thereby they-meant to convey that
the employers in the present wharf disturbance are
scrimmaging for a great cause—for the cause of
human freedom, the right of the great and howl-
ing citizen to sell his labor where and how he
chooses without being dictated to by any despic-
able and beer-stained union, and the blessed
privileges for which our fathers fought and died
at the battle of Herrings, or thereabouts. It was
a noble pose, and suggestive of the marble statue
of John Jones defying the comet. At the
same time it is to be hoped that the dailies
are not such fools at to expect the public to be de-
ceived by their pot of ink and their yell of
eloquence. There are certain phrases which are
supposed to carry conviction because of their large,
sonorous sound—for instance, many votes are said
to have been acquired on a certain occasion by a
big-mouthed orator who got on a platform and
said in a good, half-mile voice, “The chariot of
revolution is rolling along and gnashing its teeth
as it rolls” ; and it is alleged that more than one
embezzler has got off through his counsel shouting
about “our dead on a hundred battle fields.’
Similarly, there is no real meaning or appropriate-
ness in the usual remark about “the great principle
of industrial freedom,” but it sounds well, especi-
ally when the paper illustrates it with a passable
sketch of an importer in a tail coat defying
the boa-constrictor, or dashing his plug
hat in the face of the cohorts of tyranny.
Meanwhile, as remarked in this paper quite
recently, the sharebrokers’ trades-union has just
driven a Soutn Australian loan out of this market.
The union declared that if any free laborer were
round lumping any part of the loan on the finan-
cial wharf, it would boycott the ship and the
owners for ever ; in other words, it declared that
it any merchant, agent or financier not belonging
e t i| ie ' ,nion received commission for selling any
of the o.A. Government securities, the unionists
would conspire together to make the loan a failure.
Also the lawyers’ trades union is as close and raven-
ing a corporation as ever ; and the doctors’ union
boycotts the medical non-unionist just the same
as usual; and the Employers Federation is going
burly strong ; and it is not so very long since the
Sydney lelegraph intimated to the news agents
that if a new morning paper was started they
must not sell it—if they did the Telegraph
would go on strike against them, in its frantic
hostility to freedom of enterprise and such like.
Ihe recollection of things like these makes the
intelligent section of the public laugh a hoarse
laugh when the daily rag starts out to defend the
great principle of human freedom,” and similar
loose eloquence. That sort of thing is only a poor
copy of the Tom Mann variety of Yarra-bank ora-
tory, and it isn’t done half so well as Mann does
It. Mann really contrives to look something like
Danton pulling down the tyrants, and to wear the
outer semblance of the Tribune of the People;
but when Fat rises in his office, in the midst of his
sweated clerks, and shouts awkwardly for Liberty,
he looks as unconvincing as a disguised Dill
Macky cheering for the Pope in order to avert
suspicion.
Preference to Unionists.
Practically the only big point of difference now
between the N.S.W. Labor Party and State
Premier Wade in regard to the new Arbitration
Bill is that of “ preference to unionists.” Wade
is anxious not to include in the measure anything
which will look like an affirmationof that principle,
though he is content that, in administering the
new Act, the Wages Boards and the Industrial
Court may order preference to unionists if the
parties before them have agreed. Having
gone so far Wade might as well go the
whole sensible hog. Apart from its “ bogey cry ”
use by the Employers Association, there is really
nothing to be said against “preference to
unionists,” and very much to be argued in its
favor. The whole idea of industrial arbitration is
that peaceable negotiations or judicial awards
should supplant warlike strikes as a means of
settling disputes; and that there should be as
effective guarantees as possible that the awards
will be faithfully observed. The difficulty in the
last regard has always been the non-responsibility
of the individual worker, which made it difficult to
enforce a penalty against him. By substituting
the union for the individual that difficulty is, to a
great extent, got over. The union is far more
responsible, far more financial, far easier to find
if a writ has to be served. Therefore it is really
to the interests of employers that on the workers’
side of the bargain there should be a union and
not a mass of individuals; and the shortest way
to that is by giving preference of employment,
other things being equal, to the unionist over the
non-unionist. He is in the position of having
gi ven hostages for peace ; and that calls for some
reward.

Useful if Inartistic.
Item 397 —Manures, of the Australian tariff
schedule is at present on the free list. Last week
it was proposed in the Senate that superphos-
phates should pay a duty of 10s. per ton under the
general tariff and ss. per ton when manufactured
m the United Kingdom. Item 397 is marked
‘ free because of the frenzied representations of
the importers’ representatives, that without cheap
fertilisers the poor farmer would he unable to
make a living out of the splendid natural resources
of this great young country. The same gag was
tried with regard to preserved milk, agricultural
machinery, tweed pants, and leather boots.
Unless all these things were on the free
list the poor farmer would not be able to
his products in “the markets of the
world.” Manure is not an artistic sub-
ject, and in the average mind the word
suggests coarse surroundings. This extra-sensi-
tiveness on the part of some of the Australian
representatives caused them, owing to the shock
of having to deal with a malodorous subject, to
forget that a very large sum has been sunk in the
Australian superphosphate industry, and that it
employs about 1000 people, and pays, roughly,
£150,000 annually in wages. Throughout Aus-
tralia there are extensive and mostlv-undeveloped
deposits of phosphate rock and pyrites, the latter
being utilised in the manufacture of sul-
phuric acid, which enters largely into
the making of superphosphates. The indus-
try, as already established, is a considerable
one, and with the ample supplies of raw material
aviiilable might be extended indefinitely. But the
fetish that the farmer’s raw material must be
cheap, and that a duty must necessarily mean an
increase of price, carried the day in spite of the
fact that the Australian manufacturers offered to
give a guarantee that the price would not be
raised in the event of Protection being granted.
The omission of a duty is merely encouragement
to the superphosphate industry of Belgium
and Japan. The farmer does not get his
manure any cheaper, for the price of the
imported material is fixed by the price of the
local article. Although £200,000 worth of fertilisers
are imported annually, and some of the article
has been dumped by Belgium as low as £1 per
ton, the farmer does not get the benefit of the low
price. When there is a difference between it and
the local article, that difference goes into the
capacious pocket of the importer. If the im-
porters of Jap and Belgian superphosphates can
bring about the absolute loss of the Australian
capital invested in the industry, they will
promptly raise the price on the dupes whose howls
for cheap fertilisers have proved the means of
making fortunes for these same importers. If
the farmers had half the wisdom of the serpent
they would cry bitterly for Protection to the Aus-
tralian industry. Protection would shut out the
Jap and Belgian article, but it would en-
courage such competition among manufacturers
of the Australian substance that the price would
probably fall lower than ever before. But, judging
by the men he sends to Parliament to represent
him, the farmer in the aggregate is ignorant of
the first principles of fiscalism.

The Too-Rare Infant.
At the Methodist Conference, recently held in
Melbourne, the Rev. Woodfum. touched upon
the delicate, but significant, question of Victoria’s
birth-rate, its decline, and the causes thereof. He
was reported to have said (though the three dailies
vary in details) that the birth-rate, which was
42'81 per 1000 of population in 1860, had come
down to 33‘60 in 1890, and, lower still, to 24'83 in
1905. Substantially his statements are correct;
but these figures, gathered from the Victorian
Year Books for 1903-7, put a rather rosier com-
plexion on the subject:—
Birth Rate per 1000 of Population for Years
1891 and 1899-1906 Inclusive.
Victoria. Australia.
1891 33-57 34-23
1899 26-14 27-27
1900 25-79 27-31
1901 25-78 27-05
1902 25-15 26-63
1903 24-46 25-21
1904 24-65 26-30
1905 24-83 26-10
1906 25-14 26-35
Average for last eight years 25 "24 26 "53
Therein is demonstrated the dangers of a general
statement, for, as these figures show, both Vic-
toria and the Commonwealth have been on the
move upward since 1903, the worst baby-getting
year for a very long while. The advance is small
but gradual. But yet, even with the advance
thrown in, this comparison, taken from the same
source as the above, gives Australian sterility an
ignominious advertisement:
Average of Births per 1000 of Population for Five
Years Ending 1906.
Russia.. 48"9 Westr’lia 30-2 Switzer- X.S. W. . 26'6

There are only two countries worse than those in-
cluded in this list—France, which has pre-
served “prevention” as a national institution;
and Ireland, which has lost the flower of its
reproductive adults by emigration. Granted
that, by reason of Australia’s low death-rate, the
effective birth-rate of these States still ranks
comparatively high, the fact nevertheless remains
that the actual birth-rate is low. Yet, any com-
parison of the birth-rates of Toorakian and work-
ing-men districts will show that the laboring,
agricultural, and poorer classes are still fruitful.
The “ genteel,” whose means of livelihood (if any)
are to some extent parasitical, are notoriously
otherwise; and it is a deplorable fact that the
growth of cities witnesses almost invariably the
growth of this “genteel” population—clerks, shop-
men, and such —people whose main pretensions are
specklessness, servility, sobriety, and obedience,
and who are the under-men par excellence. They
are not easily moved by the needs of citizenship.
Their lives are cast among deleterious influences.
And presently they marry into their own class ;
they take unto themselves wives who are deli-
cately nurtured and superficially comely. But
that is about all. A coddling environment con-
tributes in such women to those petty little
habits of laziness that become in time
an inherent disease. Through lack of ob-
jective and the faintest conception of what
duty is, they degenerate, and drift, into luxurious
slatternliness. Much of their privacy is spent in
wrappers and slippers ; much of their time in the
absorption of erotic literature. Naturally they
become ready victims to the insidious ap-
proaches of the canvasser for abortive pro-
cesses and drugs—and the birth-rate slumps
in consequence. The whole is the result of
an irresistible drift towards what may be
called the pseudo-refinements of living. From
infancy to puberty (the period in the develop-
ment of the human animal when it is most recep-
tive), the progeny of the “genteel ” are impressed
with the never-varying claims of “ genteel” ideals;
they are taught the necessities of etiquette and
good manners ; they learn that a seemliness in
outward demeanor is the pre-requisite of social
prestige; that, in brief, a crease in the pants or a
cut in the coat is a much more satisfactory asset
than a trade. They realise the tremendous possi-
bilities of an “ appearance,” and thus the men, or
The Foolishness of Fools.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now Australia has some people that would make
an angel swear ;
They are kind of human butterflies with not a
single care,
Flitting up and down the moments to a chinky-
dinky rhyme,
Thinking nothing of to-morrow, caring not a
damn for time.
You know
It’s so.
It’s nothing but a chorus of “ How Sweet the
Roses Grow.”
The Slayers of the People are just behind the hill,
But there’s plenty time to worry when they bustle
in to kill.
I hear the prophets calling in Australia’s market
place—
They can bawl their urgent warnings till they’re
purple in the face ;
The mob has cocked its ears to where the blatant
bookies stand,
Or it’s surfing by the thousand where the waters
strike the sand.
I’in backed
By fact.
There’ll be other songs for singing when your
cheerful city’s sacked—
The Slayers of the People are just behind the hill,
And you’ll wish to God you’d worried before they
rushed to kill.
But what’s the use of anger ’cause they haven’t
got a gun ?
They’ve got no pride of nation—they are jesters
jaut for fun.
Can’t you see they’re very busy putting boodle in a
can
For the saviour of their country—a chap named
Mary Ann ?
Good man—
He can
Swing a bat as deftly as a lady swings a fan ;
And all the grown-up children they cheer him
with a will
While the Slayers of the People steal round the
frowning hill.
Ho ! Pelt the warning prophets with ripe, long-
perished cats;
Reach down the faithful sandbag and bash them
on the hats.
They’d drive a fellow dotty with their gags of
“ learn to shoot,”
It would serve the rotters useful if the push got
on the boot.
That’s what—
Damned rot.
I’m -wasting time by talking, so I’ll let you go to
pot.
And the Slayers of the People when they hustle
round the hill
Will knock you out like rabbits ’cause you didn’t
learn your drill.

The Solid Lie versus Six Part-Truths.
That Australia wants the decent, desirable immi-
grant, and most particularly the decent, desir-
able English-speaking immigrant, is now no
longer argued. On that want the effect of the
persistent neglect of the Australian Govern-
ment to appoint a High Commissioner
in London is worth considering. The great rival
of Australia in regard to immigration is Canada.
Now, Canada is represented as a single entity by
its High Commissioner. So the Canadian office
in London tells one yarn, and only one yarn, to
the desirable British emigrant. The yarn may be
a lie ; a good deal of it is, in the opinion of many
people. But it is a good, solid, reasonable, weli-
thought-out lie, and there is no one to contradict
it, so it “goes.” Australia, on the other hand, is
represented by six different State offices, all with
conflicting interests and with partly-conflicting
yarns. The S.A. office, in its effort to
get the desirable emigrant, has to compete
with the N.S.W. and the Queensland and
the Westralian offices; and it is only natural if
each of these conflicting offices makes an effort to
“put the pot on” its rivals. So the desirable
emigrant who has almost made up his mind to go
to N.S.W. falls into the hands of, say, the Queens-
land office, and then learns, first thing, that
N.S.W. is not at all the place to go to. He then,
as like as not, decides to go to Canada, because
Canada’s rosy yarn is never contradicted and the
wonderful greenness of its fields never comes
under the blight of aspersion. So what may be a
Canadian lie is able to beat six Australian state-
ments, all of which may be almost wholly true.
It’s a bad situation, and the Government here
which hasn’t the courage to end it can’t be counted
as really sincere in the desire to see a big increase
of Australian population.
The Timidity of the A.N.A.
TheA.N.A. conference, which met last week at
Maryborough (Vic.), acted up to its patriotic
reputation by declaring in favor of compulsory
military education, the abolition of State Gover-
nors, and other progressive proposals ; but it still
has much to learn in practical, as distinguished
from theoretical, politics. Delegate Shorthill
moved that “ a satisfactory system of land settle-
ment, including compulsory resumption and a
scientific system of land taxation must precede
any system of immigration.” Most of the dele-
gates wereevidently with Shorthill, but Peacock,
the shifty Kookaburra, said that the motion touched
on the domain of party politics and was therefore
taboo, and the president ruled it out. These
oratorical Natives apparently cannot grasp the
fact that every live question must necessarily be
a party one —there is always at least one party
against every progressive move—and if the A.N.A.
is never to touch party questions, it might as well
retire from political and social business forthwith.
As a matter of fact, the Compulsory Defence
and State Governor abolition proposals are both
party questions—the party that opposes them
is the same one which objects to an effective
land tax. Another delegate, representative of
the Immigration League, admitted that little had
been done to encourage immigration, and thought
that the State should do more to help the settler
in the early stages of occupation. He didn’t
explain why, but possibly the weariful Peacock
may turn his massive intellect on to the question.
There doesn’t seem any obvious reason why,
under present conditions, the State should help
the man who grows wheat or wool or cabbages
any more than the man who makes boots, or
who turns wheat into flour, or sheep into
chops. The man on the land is very largely there
as a mere tenant. The first, chief, and often the
final charge is the rent—nothing is left after that
is paid. If the farmer gets more, then the land-
lord takes more. In effect, all this much-besought
issistance to the farmer merely means putting
unearned coin in the pockets of the landowners of
the State—the men who least deserve and least
need it. The only visible remedy for that curse
is the “ scientific system of land taxation ”
advocated by delegate Shorthill— and the sooner
the A.N.A. quits its theoretics and “bogs into”
that matter the better.

Bogged.
A gaol item from Melbourne :-r-
The law has got into a considerable bog over ex-solicitor
Louis Horwitz’s demand for his release. When Horwitz
started on his six-year sentence in September, ’O4, he
might reasonably have expected release in 4£ years, but
under the penal regulations made by the Governor-in-
Oouncil such a sentence is reduced to marks, and a
prisoner is entitled to his release when has earned three-
fourths of his allotted number. Horwitz’s sentence
worked out at 18,720 marks, and as he claims that he had
earned the necessary 14,040 marks on March 13, he
d manded his liberty. He had a good deal more trouble
than he should have in getting a chance to make his
demand, for the governor of Geelong gaol, where he was
confined, persistently refused to let him see a lawyer or
refer to the matter when speaking to his periodical
visitors, and Chief-Secretary Peacock backed up the
governor in his attitude. However, Horwitz managed to
secretly communicate with a friend, who obtained a writ
of habeas corpus.
The case came before Chief Justice Madden, and that
learned gentleman was considerably surprised to find that
there doesn’t seem to be any method by which an ille-
gally-detained prisoner can obtain his freedom. Hor-
witz’s lawyer, to prove his case, demanded the produc-
tion of the daily marks list book of the gaol where his
client had been confined, and other pertinent documents.
The Crown refused toproduce them. Much argument, then,
ensued between his Honor and the Crown’s lawyer, which
showed that the only course open to Horwitz, or anyone
else similarly placed, was to demand a return. If the
return could be shown to be false, a civil action for
damages would lie, and the Judge might—only might
commit the maker of the return to gaol for contempt,
both of which remedies would be ghastly jokes to a man
in confinement. As the Crown lawyer put it, “ There is
nothing your Honor can do except to commit a person
for contempt who detains a prisoner wrongly ; ” and
though both the Chief Justice and Horwitz’s lawyer
objected to the position they could find nothing to in-
validate it.
Further, the Crown said that even if Horwitz had earned
the alleged necessary number of marks, he was in no way
entitled to his release, the remission of one-fourth of his
sentence being 1 wholly an act of grace on the part of the
Crown. Further, said the Crown, no prisoner can claim
his release even when his sentence has expired by
effluxion of time ; he can only be released on an order of
the Governor-in-Couneil on the prerogative of the Crown,
and if the Crown doesn’t choose to exercise that preroga-
tive, or forgets all about it, he just stops where he is till
further orders. It seems an amazing position, but Chief
Justice Madden didn’t know enough to disprove it, and
adjourned the matter indefinitely while he thought
things over.

Until recently the big Dividing Range had pro-
tected Gippsland from the rabbit pest; but now
rabbits are found over nearly the whole of the
province. So a Gippsland Rabbit Suppression
League has been started. Obviously it is com-
posed entirely of landowners, Anti-Sosh to a man ;
but it seems quite natural to learn that about the
first business of the League was to approach the
Government for assistance. The only surprising
thing was that the League passed by Bent and
went to the Australian Government. This is
partly explained by the fact that one of its
first requests was that the Danysz microbe should
be let loose in Gippsland. But the microbe was
only one item in the League’s programme. Its
chief spokesman was Councillor Macdonald, and
he orated to this effect: —
The Government should, by all the means in its power,
assist pastoralists to get rid of the pest. If they save
£5,000,000 or £10,000,000 for an effective method it would
be money well spent. Assistance should also be given in the
matter of wire-netting. The Federal Government ought
to establish a factory capable of supplying the whole
Commonwealth at cost price. This might be called
Socialism,' hut he did not care what it was called so long
as the netting was supplied.
Councillor Macdonald is a capital type of the
Anti-Sosh farmer. Socialism is all right as long
as it means cheap wire-netting for him and his
brother graziers; but if it is for the benefit of the
farm-laborer, or the factory operative, it is a
thing accursed. The Bulletin does not know
Macdonald, but it has a shrewd suspicion that he
looks very hard at ss. before he spends the amount.
But, when the Commonwealth is the spender, he
talks about millions as if old harrassed Bill Lyne
had a gold-making machine in the back-yard of
the Treasury.

“F.C. If Premiers Bent and Wade are
earnest in their expressions of sympathy for the
men of burden who lump the heavy wheat bags,
and object to the Commonwealth restrictions
solely because they (the local Premiers) have been
robbed of the chance to do the toilers a good
turn themselves, they have now a chance to show
what they can do by lightening the burdens of the
coal lumpers on the wharves. One coal co. lately
started using bags almost as tough as the stoutest
canvas, weighing 111 b. each when empty, and
averaging 3201 b. when filled. While the argu-
ments were proceeding about the massive wheat
bags, the coal co. withdrew these monstrosities;
but now they are in use again, and other com-
panies are adopting them. Not only do they
break the lumpers’ backs, but it is nothing un-
usual to see men completing a shift with their
hands bleeding and torn worse than those of a
prize-fighter after a 20-round mill. The two
State Premiers, though they never did anything
themselves for the grain lumpers, allege that
Federal interference is quite needless, because
they fully meant to do something. The coal-
lumping iniquity gives them a show. They have
no Federal interference to allege in that case as a
reason why they should do nothing, and there is
no reason why their boasted sentiments of
humanity shouldn’t burst forth like the very
devil, so to speak, and blossom like the rose, and
flourish like the big eucalyptus tree.
In Papua the remnants of the old, discredited
Administration don’t get on too well with the
vigorous new men, and there is said to be some
small coolness. No permanent appointment of
an Administrator has been made, because Captain
Barton, the person that failed, is still nominally
in charge, though absent on leave; and as the
new men are only “acting,” they haven’t the
status of permanent officials. This and the small
coolness has brought the gigantic intellect of
Kelly, M.H.R., into play. Kelly propounds
the theory that because the old men and the new
ones don’t fully agree, all the men now in Papua,
no matter what good work some of them may have
done, should be passed over, and some outsider,
an imported man for preference, who has done
nothing at all, should get the position. If Kelly
had been Solomon, when the two mothers came
to him, both claiming the infant, he would prob-
ably have decided that, as the two ladies couldn’t
agree, the infant should be thrown out of t]?e top
window. And, if Australia were Kelly (which,
thank God, it is not!) it would probably decide
that as Kelly and Bill Lyne can’t agree, the
only thing to do would be to hang both of them.
The men who are now running things in Papua
have done good work, but of course the remains of
the old gang, which made a pretty bad
failure, doesn’t approve of them. That is
no reason why the new men shouldn’t
be confirmed in their positions. Kelly’s
idea is that if Smith had the billet and failed, and
Brown got it on trial and succeeded, but quite
naturally didn’t secure the good opinion of the
superseded Smith, therefore they should both be
passed over, and the totally-unknown Jones, who
may be ten times worse than Smith was, should
be imported instead. It is a beautiful sample of
wisdom, based on the general principle that
nobody should get a job save the man who has no
enemies at all—and he is generally the village
idiot.

The brief debate on Federal Old Age Pensions
showed that fully six out of every seven members of
the House of Representatives are outwardly favor-
able, and in the Senate the proportion is probably
much thesame. There are so many and such obvious
reasons in favor of the idea that quite a number of
members who have no love for it will probably
smother their feelings and look as friendly as they
know how. But, all the same, it doesn’t follow
that Federal Old Age Pensions are coming this
session or even next one. The money has to be
found, and all manner of fatal and superfluous
friends will probably see impossibilities, and State
wrongs, and incurable discrepancies in every
method of raising it that can possibly be suggested.
It is to be hoped that the Federal Labor
party won’t make the mistake of thinking that its
work is done, or even half done, because all three
parties approve of Old Age Pensions in a general
way. The enthusiastic and bogus friends who
talk measures to death haven’t started work yet.
One way of raising the money, and probably the
best, would be by means of a Federal graduated
land and income-tax. It wouldßequire a robust
fight to get these imposts legalised, but then™
would take a big fight to legalise any impost that
would bring in the money that is require , *
graduated land-tax is a good subject to fight over

Queensland, like S. Australia, is seriously con-
sidering whether it has any use for an imported
Governor, and whether a cheap local x
like Arthur Morgan wouldn tdo as well. hen
the excited local Governor gets up at the banquet
to protest against his own abolition, the best.he
can say for himself is that he is a lin
ing the State with the dear old Ma Land. But,
as a matter of fact, he has ceased to be even that.
When a State wants to speak in the ear ot .Eng-
land its message goes through the Australian
Governor-General, and the State link doesn J
us to England at all. It is a link that is only con-
nected at one end. But, though the Canadian
provinces have purely local Governors, it is under-
stood that Britain doesn’t approve of the prin-
ciple, and it is commonly reported in b.A. that
Governor Le Hunte’s term will be extended
in order to postpone the settlement of the problem.
When Le Hunte leaves it is expected that S. A.
will shake him cordially by the hand, and say that
it is glad its very last imported Governor has been
such a success, and that, though the system o
importing Governors has outlived its usefulness, it
was a very good system in its day. But if Le
Hunte doesn’t go there will be no chance to make
that remark.
A LETTER from Adelaide :
Acting-Premier Kirkpatrick has been cruel to the
South-Eastern District squatters who have been clamor-
ing for freezing works and better facilities for carrying
their stock to market by rail and steamer. He pointed
out that the South-East (which, by the way, is repre-
sented by his colleague, Treasurer Peake) has only 19,000
inhabitants on 4,000,000 acres. Kirkpatrick went on to
say: “That was a most deplorable fact. What they
needed was that the land be put to better use,
and that could only be brought about by com-
pulsory repurchase. The railway ran 150 miles to
reach a handful of people. It was a question for thein as
citizens and for him as a Minister of the Crown whether
the Government would be justified in a further large out-
lay on the railway. He sympathised with the people of
the south-east who were at a disadvantage. The solution
would be the repurchase of these millions of acres or
whatever there was of them valuable enough. The
interests of individuals must not stand in the way. They
wanted the land for closer settlement.
Then the deputation went away very sorrowful,
and doubtless remarked that Kirkpatrick is a
discursive cuss who never will keep to the point.
And he certainly doesn’t keep to the point. When
a deputation of the men who keep the land empty
waits on him and asks for a railway over 500 miles
of grass, he flys off the handle and asks why there
aren’t some people there to use the railway.

From Beatrice Grimshaw, in her S. M. Herald
narrative, “The Truth About Papua” :
And this town (at Thursday Island)—is it really a part
of Australia, or is it a province of Japan ?
There is certainly but one opinion on that point among
the little yellow men themselves. Clad for the most part
in European clothing, which they grace exceedingly
ill, they swagger up and down the streets in dozens,
almost pushing the white people off the footways,
and refusing tq give anyone decent room to pass.
In their shops, which outnumber the others ten to one,
they almost insult the white purchasers who come in
from the steamers, innocently expecting some attention
and civility. Perhaps they will attend to you when they
feel inclined, perhaps they won’t. In any case, if you
buy anything you have got to carry it home yourself.
They do not want you or your like, and they make it
plain—a little too plain.
The truth is—and it is not a pleasant truth—that the
Japanese own Thursday Island in everything but name.
Practically the whole of the pearling fleet is i n their hands.
Those boats which are not owned by Japanese are manned
by them, and the divers are allowed to keep all the pearls
they find, after first of all receiving £BO a ton for their
shell. Twenty-three thousand a year is the average value
of the pearls obtained, and practically every half-penny
of this goes to Tokio or Nikko, as well as the £BO per ton
for the shell. Australian dealers buy most of the pearls,
so that it may be said Australia pays the Japanese over
£20,000 per annum for her own pearls. Of the uses to
which that £20,000 may be put some of these days there
is no need to speak, for everyone knows.
The number of Japanese in Thursday Island is over
2000. The garrison of the little fort on the hill is 60 Aus-
tralian soldiers. There are also a few dozen white resi-
dents in the town. It will be seen, therefore, that so far
as population and possessions go, Thursday Island is
much more Japanese than Australian. How far it is wise
to allow an important outpost in the unprotected North
thus to remain practically in the hands of a jealous
foreign Power is a matter for the consideration of Aus-
tralian legislators.
Another matter which certainly deserves some atten-
tion is the fact that Japanese are at present in the habit
of running over in cutters from Thursday Island to the
Western division of Papua, and occasionally taking ship
down to Port Moresby. What do they want ? They are
not very communicative on that point. But they seem
fond of taking photographs, and admiring the scenery
generally. If Australia is undefended, Papua is still more
so. And there is no saying what may happen by-and-bye,
after America has been dealt with, and the time has come
to break pie-crust promises never meant to last longer
than happened to be convenient.
Some Victorian farmers are evidently-
determined to make the most of their huge wheat
bags while the supply lasts. The other day
farmer W. Fuller, of Rainbow (Vic.), sent away a
record truck-load from the local station. One bag,
standing 4ft. 6in. high, tipped the scale at 4751b5.,
another at 4621b5., others at 410, 323, 311, 3101b5.,
etc. Fuller suggestive name presumably
didn’t load up those bags himself; neither will
Fuller personally unload them. When Bent
shouts at the coming State Premiers’ conference
about alleged Federal interference in this bag
question, someone ought to ask him why, if he
sympathises with the lumpers as much as he says
he does, he doesn’t put a sudden end to the whole
disgraceful business by refusing to carry bags over
2001bs. or even 2401b5. on the railways—even as
other railway chiefs have refused.
Naturally Senator Pulsford, fresh from
London, and charged to the muzzle with wisdom
of the brand they used to keep on tap at the Man-
chester Freetrade Hall, has turned some of the
energies of his colossal intelligence to what it is
the fashion to call the Defence problem. This
he says, is exciting attention in Britain. The
Australian Government proposals “ had not been
fully criticised in military circles” before he left
But,
As far as he discovered, Senator Pulsford doubted that
it met with the approval of experts. When reminded
that Lord Roberts had expressed his approbation of the
scheme, Senator Pulsford said he rather expected he would.
because Lord Roberts for some time had been
something like conscription in England. ° “
Roberts is generally supposed to be Britain’s boss
expert these times, and if the Deakin Government
has him on its side, it has at least some slight
support. And Roberts is at least a concrete
personality. The others are just unnamed and
undefined “ experts ’’-presumably Smith, Jones
and Co., backed up by the hesitating support of
Ferguson.

Further consideration of “The Lady
Dandies,” at Her Majesty’s (Sydney), raises a
hope that the musical comedy that labelled itself
as such because it hadn’t enough brains or music
to be a self-supporting comic opera, hashed for ever
from the stage, and is hurriedly draping its
shroud around itself in the recesses of the crema-
torium. It has, however, left its ghost behind it
to haunt the “ comedy opera,” and every nowand
then it stalks in amongst the gay stage crowd
and takes the sparkle off the show for a
brief moment or two. One of the baneful
tendencies of musical comedy—which, as a rule,
was more often musical tragedy—was to manufac-
ture meaningless stage “ business ” for the chorus,
and “ The Lady Dandies” people haven’t quite got
over the old bad habit. YVhat, for instance, is meant
when each one of a number of young women puts
her right hand behind her head and kicks lan-
guidly with one foot? The singer at the time is
making some remarks about cuckoos, and no light
is thrown on the subject by the chorus kicking
with one foot. The original function of the
chorus was to explain the action of the play.
Nowadays, it can’t even explain itself.
# * * *
Id the “Dandies ” the largest spray of the
laurel wreath is hereby awarded to Roberts. His
Dorlis goes a long away towards hoisting the play
on the path to the Gilbert and Sullivan pinnacle.
The “ Redoubt ” song—finely done in the early
part of the first act—quickens the audience to
encore pitch almost before it has settled down.
Florence Young, with the clear _ top-note
much benefited by a holiday, sings and
acts the rather heavy part of Lado-
iska with all her old-time vivacity, and
wears three costumes that require three poets and
six dressmakers to adequately describe. Edmund
Sherras (Lagorille), the new baritone, strikes this
paper as being one of the best men seen here of
late years. He acts with dignity, and has a voice
of great richness. Bantock, Leslie, and Percy
contrive to hold up the comedy department among
them. Bantock occasionally wears a harassed
look beneath the grease-paint, but never-
theless does excellent work. Two of Les-
lie’s exits —one where he hands Dorlis his
wife’s decree absolute, and the other where
Flo Young tries to wheedle State secrets out of
him —are gems of pantomime and deserve men-
tion. Fan Dango, as Illyrine, has not very much
to do, and one song is a little beyond her range,
but she makes up for it all in winsomeness, and,
hardened critic as this paper is, it refuses to re-
buke her for attempting that little which is too
much. The music right through has the look and
taste of the drink that requires no bush, and the
dressing is unalloyed bliss.

The arrival of Maskelyne and Devant’s
mysteries at Sydney Palace is an affair of more
interest than the coming of most shows. For
something like 25 years J. N. Maskelyne has held
his position as king of magicians. He has exposed
spiritualistic deceivers, performing all their alleged
occult mysteries, and a crowd of others they never
dreamed of, by purely mechanical means. Maske-
lyne has grown into a great British institution; he
is one of the props of the Throne and Empire,
and also stands for the sanctity of the home.
Although the magician himself is not with the
company that opens on Saturday, it is composed
of men who have been with him for years, and
some of whom have invented “mysteries” of
their own. One of the great attractions of the
show will be Mr. Maskelyne’s famous box trick,
which has become famous all over the world, and
has driven a number of rival magicians insane
with envy.

Recent scrutiny proves that “ The Power
of the Cross” has in no wise diminished. Nightly
the loathsome Curzola runs his vampire course
till such time as Rita’s dagger (rendered lethal by
the imminence of the sacred emblem) penetrates
his midriff ; whereat a piercing yelp occurs, and
Dalmatia and the world in general are rid of a
very unpleasant fellow. Vamping, contorting in
the limelight, strangling in the cateh-as-catch-can
and other styles, and kindred sports will be the
order of the night at Sydney Criterion till further
notice.

West’s Pictures at Sydney Glaciarium are
still performing the laudable feat of combining a
lot of amusement with a certain amount of in-
struction. The pictures hang on to the coat tails
of history so tightly that they recently showed the
funeral of Portugal’s murdered royalties—and
they can’t get much closer than that without
bumping history’s back wheel and causing a spill
on the path of Time. This week’s programme
shows how the Canadian settler reaps the snow
storm and shears the blizzard, and after that it
folds itself into a gondola and floats round Venice.
The humorous section of the bill is particularly
good, and the crowd that streams away for its
tram and boat at the conclusion of the performance
wears the broad smile of content.

The announced intention to produce “A

Instead, on Saturday “The Scarlet Pimpernel

The Butt-Rumford charity concert in
Sydney realised manager Tait’s guess of £5OO,
plus about £25 from sale of programmes. An
army of nurses insinuated these on to the audience.
Devotion, patriotism, and flirtation might fairly
label the groups of songs that made up the popular
programme. No one can deny that those three
subjects are most popular ideals. “Abide With

pleased to note the progress of this local industry.
Messrs. Wunderlich are still increasing the size of their
factory at Redfern and are busy just now erecting a
large factory at Wellington, New Zealand. They have

“ on the scurvy treatment meted
out to villains :
In melodrama supreme virtue and supreme incivility
re ,vt r tT y f!u d - UlB an absorbing thing in this class
or work to note the uncanny infallibility with which the
stage person of probity diagnoses the undesirable; and
thereafter flails him verbally on every occasion. Thus the
villain as harmless-seeming, barring his cigarette, as
any lamb—enters and proposes, ere ever he has slit a
solitary weazand, honorable wedlock to the heroine
Does the lady squirm in coy gratification before regret-
fully refusing him, as any other maiden whose hand was
already bespoken might? She does not. Rising to her
fuil height, she advances up stage, seething with fury
Arrived at the correct mark, she halts, wheels, and heaves
something like the following at her wooer :
“ Cow-ahd, ah cow-ahd I Yew ! Yew !! to seek the
?'it K f a P ew :-fr gwrl. Know- now that sooner than
walk by your side to the sacred altar of Hymen and there
pronounce those holy words that would for ever bind us
man and wife I would climb ” (pointing towards the lime-
hght man) to the topmost summit of yo-honder tower
and fling myself to certain death on the stones below-ho ”
(Deafening applause during which the rejected lover
retires confused and undone.) J
Later he unwarily asks the comic Yorkshire man (with
- response
“Thow dog Dowst think that fer orl ma known
fondness fer the licker ah’d descend ter lush with the
laaks o thow ? Go whoam, laad 1 Go whoam ! and learn
a little o decency and British honesty afower ye dare
a rew Yarkshire tyke ter drenk wi* ver again.”
(Yells of approval. The rebuked one slinks off in an un-
fastened state.)
The hero is always very rude to the villain on sight—
when he is not maddeningly patronising in an irritating
parsomcal fashion. The hero’s heart-broken and maudlin
father is also offensive ; likewise most of the minor
characters.
But the luckless man’s bitterest hour strikes when his
accomplice turns on him—a sure happening in anv
properly-constructed melodrama. He has made some
perfectly reasonable suggestion to his ally—reasonable
that is, in view of the fact that the twain, having already
fractured every law in the Decalogue and caused the
Seven Deadly Sins to appear anamiic, it is really imma-
terial what other villainy they achieve—when the other
suddenly gets a spasm of righteousness. The degraded
look vanishes from his face. He raises his eyes to Heaven
fumblingly removes his burglar’s cap with the cat’s
fur round it, and speaks :
I vebii-] a bad ’ un> Gord knows,” he observes brokenly
but (raising his voice) “ ’arm a woman or an innercent
che-ild I never did, nor never will. Stan’ back, ver callus
ound, and leave the gurl go free ! ” (Howling.)' “ I’ll not
do yer bidding. It’s such men as yew, with yer aristocrat
wiles, what brings poor blokes like me,” etc., to the
accompaniment of much gamp-hammering and cries of
encouragement.
I would not be a stage villain myself for anything.
People, behind and in front of the house alike, are more
discourteous to him than they are to leading politicians.

Charles Mildare, a remarkable whistler,
and J. P. Ling, who bears the imposing title of
Mimetic Monologist, are the latest arrivals at
Sydney Tivoli. Miss Margaret Parker again pre-

makes a welcome reappearance. Ike and Will
Scott, Walter Whyte, George Deane, Frank Har-
wood, Muriel Andrews and some others are also
present. The Sisters Klo3 and the Three Cunards
are in their last nights, and will shortly fold up
their dress baskets and depart to gather laurels
elsewhere.

At present the concern of tract distribu-
tors and mothers’meetings is centred in “The
Little Bread Winner,” at Melbourne Royal. Yet
even the most poke-bonnetted lady of the Dorcas
clan, after three hours of exalted moral splurge,
will experience the heavy feeling of one
who has collided with something immense. Some-
how, the play has strayed from the path of
dramatic rectitude. It has lost itself and become
a mixture of good intentions and imbecility. Its
lofty tastelessness and the disproportion of one
tank of sanctity to one pint of sense inspire pity
for the unique mind of its maker. Such a
mind might have won the world’s acclaim creat-
ing ball-dresses or inventing new skin foods. In
its dramatic capacity, and its distortion of simple
unalterable facts, like religion, bets, beer, and kids,
into the abstract fancies of a madhouse proprietor,
it seems to exceed the limit. Still, the dispensing
of a soft sad bog of pathos and weep is a neces-
sary abasement to the million. Even ostlers and
marine-store dealers require some sort of intellec-
tual recreation.

The Bulletin turns to the subject of
“ Miss Lancashire Ltd.” with increasing yawns.
In fact, it finds it hardly worth while to shut its
mouth after the last yawn, knowing that it will
open for the ensuing yawn almost immediately.
For many weeks the effulgent central figure of
the show has made the Bijou her Melbourne
address. For quite that period Mary E. Thomp-
son has frivolled like an eg’regiously giddy
mastodon. In concealing food—indeed in general
behaviour—she has conducted herself in a manner
befitting a creature unaccustomed to polite society.
And Miss Thompson doesn’t seem to improve in
her manners or her table habits as time rolls on.

“ Brewster’s Millions,” at Her Majesty’s
(Melb .), is still drawing the cash out of the
pockets of the multitude. The central idea of the
play (a young man vainly trying to squander
an enormous fortune) appeals to the tame
playgoer, wearied to death of the endless
riot for the hard but necessary crust; and he takes
himself and wife and all the relations he’s on
speaking terms with to see it. Brewster will
squander for some weeks to come.

Last Monday afternoon the interior of Her
Majesty’s (Melbourne) was the scene of a compli-
mentary benefit to Miss Jennie Lee, the well-
remembered actress of other days—she who played
“Jo,” and was always moved on by Bucket and
Co. The performance, to which practically all
the Melbourne theatrical folk enthusiastically con-
tributed, was necessarily a somewhat bulky
matter. Still, if the result assays at sufficient
gold to justify the proceedings, the bulk was
rather a recommendation than otherwise.

Frank Thornton has said “ Do you know?”

tatnves of the States, and all the other attractions,
till the stage is as crammed as the house. Panto-
mime Fortnight is an important occasion in
Adelaide, and the railways are excitedly running

a sporting chance of seeing “H. Dumpty” four
evenings, with two matinees over. However, he
puts in some of the time in seeing Tom Burrows

hard on the rock floor at the skating rink, and

AT POVERTY POINT.
“ Hiphen ” : People who should have known better
told me that I was missing- my life unless I went and wit-
nessed “ Charley’s Aunt.” I was told it was “ the
funniest farce that has ever been written.” I hate to
miss anything, so I went. It may have been funny five
years ago. It certainly isn’t now. Things have moved
some since the piece first saw the footlights. I sat back
in my seat and prepared to loose the hilarious scream
when it came. It didn’t come. Perhaps I’m blasi,
or something equally French. The fact remains
that the man masquerading as a woman, and the subse-
quent situations, left me cold. The excited running on
and off of ancient suitors, and all other jaded and time-
worn complications, failed to dislodge one single burst of
merriment from my internal cavity. The scenes which
once were new and hilarious have, in the intervening
years, found too many imitators. Now Charles’ female
relative, stripped of originality, is left naked in her
humorless old age to face the criticism of jaded and
theatre-worn audiences like myself.
A new play by a new woman writer has made an imme-
diate success in London. The Referee says that George
Musgrove was in the house on the second night, negotiat-
ing for the Australian rights. The play, “ Diana of Dob-
son’s,” has a first act showing the dormitory at a big
draper’s, with theyoung-women assistants undressing for
bed. “ The thing is so tactfully done that you are not
shocked even when one of them actually pops into a flan-
nelette nightgown before your very eyes.” After
that the action becomes more conventional—some-
what on “ Merely Mary Ann ” lines—till the end,
which is as original as the beginning. Diana has “ Brew-
stered ” the small legacy which enabled her to get out of
the shop. Her lover has renounced his wealth because she
chaffed him about being a waster who couldn’t earn his
own living. And he can’t ; and neither can she ; and
they drift together, in rags, on the Thames embankment;
and they very sensibly’ decide that he had better reach
out after his unearned wealth again, and marry the girl ;
and they borrow a shilling from a policeman and are left
making a betrothal supper on “ cawfee and a slice ” at
curtain-fall.
“J.A.C.”: “Pro.” states (B. 26/3/’08) that the late
J. B. Howe “mentions in an entertaining autobiography
that he was inexplicably known in the profession as Tom
Howe." I read the book, “A Cosmopolitan Actor,” a
good many years ago, and I cannot recollect any such
passage, although I am quite willing to accept “ Pro.’s”
assurance that it does exist. In that case, the inexplica-
bilities cumulate, for in the work in question Howe’s
father, if I mistake not, is represented as address-
ing him as “ Tom.” Apart from all this, I do
know that while we were living in the same
hotel in Wellington (M.L.) Howe told me that his
name was Thomas Burdett Howe, and I remember that
his wife used to call him “Tom.” Besides, Howe was
never known in the profession otherwise than as “ J. 8.”
On another point “ Pro ”is miles at sea. He says : “ The
brother of novelist Ben Farjeon was known on the Aus-
brother £ as ,, Walte ‘’ Howe.” Novelist Farjeon’s
brother adopted the name of “John ” Howe, and he was
welfandTa A . l ? stralian . staffe at all. I knew him

than draw a certain number of pleasure-seekers nightly
„ ro . m f t he insanitary jests of imported music hall artists
and the unhealthy excitement of imported “Jack the
Kipper bellowdrama, they will serve a good purpose.
“Snell”: I thought previous cheap melodramatists
had exploited the possibilities of the precocious kid but
the makers of “ The Little Breadwinner,” now in active
eruption at Melbourne Royal, go many better than their
predecessors, with a baby girl, who is general provider
and head of the family. Not content with keeping papa
mamma, and the comic attache in bed and board, this
marvellous offspring takes a hand in confounding the
knavish tricks of the adventuress, and bluffing off the
ponderous villain in his more homicidal moments. For
instance, when the low, broad comedian climbs to the
third storey window of a den of infamy to rescue the hero
from the tentacles of the bad persons, he hauls the six-
year-old miracle up after him, in order that, w’hen he and
pa, make a break for the window to escape, with banded
iniquity hot on their heels, the sweet little girl may
prance from behind the curtains, a “gun” in either
hund exclaiming: “No, you don’t!” and hold-up the
fearful villain and his awful accomplice. I have seen
nothing more heroic than the splendid struggle of the
tragic mite to retain her two sagging artilleries in a
horizontal position while the curtain gets down.
Frank Thornton struck a dreadful frost at Ballarat on his
farewell night. A rumor spread with mad speed that Willie
lies was to land in the town that evening, and all Ballarat
and its dog, deserting the Thornton show, surged to the
station to give the suspect greeting. Not the brightest
of mimes can hope to rival the real-life principal during
the run of his show.
“Micawber”: A polite way of looking forward to a
domestic event is delightfully put by the leading Yankee
vaudeville paper, Variety “ Mr. and Miss
feel sure that they will be unable to fulfil vaudeville con-
tracts during the coming summer.”
The builder of the first Brisbane theatre (1856), Mr. W.
H. Ford, is still on top. He is a resident of Malvern-road
bouth Yarra, Melbourne, and is aged 78 vears. He has
been 60 years in Australia, and made his d6but as an
actor in the old Victoria Theatre, Pitt-street, Sydney, in
Theatrical London clamors ever for something new and
strange, but till last month Cockneydom had not wit-
nessed a Sicilian play acted by the Sicilian rustics who
are the leading, and in fact only, mimes of their island
Sicily is still, for the most part, a wild and lawless spot.
Its inhabitants steal things from each other at the
point of the poniard, and despise the law, and make
a hobby of brigandage. The theatre in Sicily would
appear to reflect pretty faithfully the life of the people.
“ Malia,” the Dago play which has just been staged at the
Shaftesbury Theatre, London, seems crude and barbaric
as to construction. The main interest occurs when some-
one slowlv, and with the gusto and loving care of the
artist in slaughter, cuts another’s throat from ear to ear.
There are no emotional nuances. The performers have
the direct methods of prize-fighters. They are, say
the theatrical critics, neither ugly nor good-looking,
though they are all of singularly short stature. They use
a provincial dialect which Italians cannot understand
and in the frenzied earnestness of their gesticulations re-
semble Chinese players. At the leading man, Cavaliere-
Grasso, the London Chronicle heaves the following stun-
ning brick r “He is not what one would call impressive.
Indeed, there is something about his walk which tells us
clearly that the manners of the Sicilian peasant and the
English coster must have a common ancestry.” There
will probably be an assassination in the Chronicle office
when Grasso learns English and appreciates the measure
of the wrong that has been done him.
“ Adelaide” : E. W. Hornung’s bold but unconvincing
bushranger stories of the “ Stingaree” series have been
made (by himself) into a play. He is considered to have
been unwise in not getting help from someone accus-
tomed to writing for the stage, and London does not
promise to give “Stingaree” another “Raffles” boom.
Miss Ada Ferrar—the first Mercia that Australia saw, to
Julius Knight’s Marcus Supercilious—is described as
being “excellent as the loud and sarcastic squatter’s
wife, though at times somewhat exaggerating the
caricature.” And this recalls an innocent remark
dropped by Julius K. long afterwards. It was well
known that off the stage Marcus and Mercia were
absolutely not on speaking terms. He, being
a man, did not talk about this ; she, being a woman,
talked about it freely. M. Superbus suffered in silence ;
but, long after, chatting about players in London—
“ Beatrice Ferrar?” he said—“Oh, yes, a sister of Ada
Ferrar, and very like her.” And, a little later, all un-
consciously, “Beatrice Ferrar did well in such-a-play;
she is very good in cattish parts.” And the bystanders
either suppressed or didn’t suppress a smile.
“ Harrison O.”: The greatest nuisance to be found in
the theatre is the man (or worse still, the woman) who
“ has read the book.” I met one of him, the other night,
when I was having a shilling - worth of “Brewster’s
Millions.” He started to catee. ~se me before the curtain
went up. He commenced by interrogating : “Haveyer
read th’book, matey?” I was fool enough to answer
“No.” “Good book. Had it frum th’ li-ber-e t’other
week.” I endeavored to look bored. “He haster spend
two ’undred thou’ ef luvely quids in a year. An’ he does
it, my oath 1 An’ ’e gets a millyun.” As I did not appear
interested, he glanced down at the programme for in-
spiration. “ This’ere Swearengen Jones, ’e won’t be on
till near th’ last, ieast ’e wasn’t in th’ book.” The curtain
went up and for a while all was well until the entrance of
Peggy Gray. That started him again. “In th’
end ’e marries Peggy. That’s ’er just come on.
She’s ’n orlri tart. When Brewster” At this
point somebody behind cursed him in a whisper, and
simultaneously he was struck in the left eye by a well-
aimed pea-nut, so he relapsed into mystified silence. At
the end of the first act he broke out again, holding forth
to all the unfortunates in the immediate vicinity’ and ex-
plaining the plot with as great gusto as if he had himself
been concerned in its construction. He kept on all
through the second act, and out of the 49 pieces of orange
peel which were thrown at him 37 struck me. At the
end of the act I left for refreshment, but when I got out-
side I found him still at my elbow’, and he was informing
me “ They’ve gone an’ left out th’ dinkiest part, where th’
footpad bloke sticks up Brewster an’ robs ’im ef two
hundred quids.” Over in the bar I had my drink, but did
not enjoy it, as he was still explaining the plot of the play
to me. Having finished, I put down my mug with a bang,
while the man—who evidently thought me a fool—turned
t° someone else and remarked, “Snortin’ play. Read th’
book ? As 1 rushed out °f the bar T hear;! him explain-
ing, This ere Mrs. De Mills, in th’ book ” P
"*~ lb ; i : l 6me ? f tbe posters one bumps up against

or of Mick Paul either. On the outside wall of a Mel-

ing the mysterious sign “Les Apauches du Far West ”
whatever that may mean, and the nightmare was in
thorough keeping with its legend.
Theatrical folk in Maoriland sometimes play in quee-t
places, but a backblocks —th rate co. that bravely gave a
performance some weeks ago in the morgue at Okahune

of giving the audience the blue creeps was unfortunately
missed through neither “ The Beautiful Fiend ” nor “The

through his hat. The architect’s plans show that Wil-
liam s new building is going to be larger in every respect
than, say, the Yarra-side Theatre Royal. Not only will
the seating accommodation in “front ” of the new house be
greater, but the stage (while the same depth as that of
the Royal) is considerably wider than is the stage of
the latter theatre. As a fact, the stage of the coming
house will be the largest in Australia.
Melb. shows praiseworthy accuracy in locating the
pubs, adjoining the site of the future theatre, in which
respect his par is of value.
Sydney Lyceum Theatre, where the oppressed Eugenie
Duggan was many a time saved by the strong arm of the
law, while husband Bill Anderson was supported by the
stronger arm of the profits, has been turned inside out
and painted on both surfaces. But, since the late Eb.
Vickery bought it, it isn’t to be a theatre any more : you
are to Christianity upstairs and a chop on the ground-
floor. bo the podgy, undressed nymphs and things that

chiselled off, and there is nothing now in the wide
expanse of front to bring a blush to the Methodist face.
“ Harrison O.” : “Blue Peter” (30/l/’08), is about right
when he opines that the bestowal of applause by the gods
at bellowdranmieris purely a matter of punctuation. It
must be something of the kind. T’other night I witnessed
a performance of the “Village Blacksmith ” and was con-
siderably mystified at the frequent rounds of foot-stamp-
ing, cat-calls and whistling. F’rinstance, the hero and
aristocratic villain are talking amiably together, and as
this happens in the first act, the hero, of course, doesn’t
know that the villain is a villain. This gent lights the usual
villainesque cigarette and offers his case to the hero
No,” exclaims the blacksmith bloke, “I prefer me

the bob rush 1)
“Hiphen”: Pantomimes were very different in my
young day. They used to be performances for children—
clowns demons, fairies, big heads, giants, harlequinades,
and all that sort of racket. But now—well now, mother
and father and Uncle Sam (bad Uncle Sam with’the bald
head and the dubious past), and sister Kate and her
young man, and brother Harry and his girl, all take
little Winnie to the panto. They say how amused little
Winnie will be. Pantos are such a treat for children.
Well, mother laughs at the funny man till she breaks
something. When the lights are turned low sister Kate
and her young man, and brother Harry and his voung
thing, hold hands and play feet and all that, you know.
Then when there’s a ballet on, or the beautiful Prince
with the tight trousers appears, Dad and Bad Uncle Sam
fight for the opera-glasses. In fact, they all have the
time of their lives. All, that is, except little Winnie
After vainly trying to see past a stout lady, with feathers
in her hair, and after striving to understand the funny
man’s topical songs, little Winnie gives it up and goes to
sleep. When the show is over, the family wake her up
and tell her how much she has enjoyed herself. Next day
at the club Dad and Bad Uncle Sam comment to the
boys: “ Awfully rotten, really—but one must give the
youngsters an outing.”

A variety artist named Alfred William James met with a
curious accident at the Olympia, Liverpool (England), in
January. He was walking across the stage—not demon-
stratively, but just walking—when one of his legs col-
lapsed and he fell to the ground. He was picked up and
carried off, and it was found that his knee-cap was
fractured. Apparently it had just given out for no
visible reason, like the famous One Hoss Shay. The
audience applauded tremendously, which is a dismal
reflection on the mirthfulness of some “ sketches ”—tliey
are so serious that an accident and a sketch can’t be
recognised apart.
THE JESTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When we remember that, in days gone by, those whose
vocation it was to amuse and entertain, were entirely
dependent on the generosity of their audiences for their
sustenance, and consider the enormous salaries members
of the profession earn nowadays, it must be admitted
that the demands of London music hall artists for sub-
stantial increases in their salaries is preposterous
English paper.
In days of old, in castle keep,
There gathered potent barons and knights.
Of feasting long and drinking deep,
And swapping lies of bygone fights
They’d tire. Then o’er the festive board
The jester lean, with cap and bells,
Would smile and smirk, and from his hoard
Of quips, and humor’s bubbling wells
He lavished ennui’s antidote.
His pay he reckoned not in gold.
His pants were frayed, and old his coat.
He supped on scraps and victuals cold.
But times have changed, and nowadays
The jesters still amuse the crowd ;
From circle, stall and pit we gaze
At Knights with voice and jewels loud.
And, strange to say, the jester stout
(Of quids he draws a heap per week)
Still squirms, gyrates, and hops about,
But scorns to talk in accents meek.
In chambers gorgeous lives this bloke;
His diet’s fizz and peacock’s brains ;
He pays a dollar for a smoke,
And jaunts about in special trains.

“ W.J.C.” from Charters Towers (N.Q.) :
Re the Broken Hill bakers’ strike, and the demand of
the dough-boys of other parts for day instead of night
work. Here, and in very nearly every other town in
North Queensland, it is all day work in the bakeries, and
has been so this last ten or twelve years. Customers,
moreover, seem to like the bread all the better. It is
fresh, but not hot. The men start about half-past-six in
the morning and are away home again before it is dark.
Then they get their night’s rest, instead of walking round
all day with a pillow, looking for a cool spot to sleep in,
and poking about in the dark doing their work. It’s more
natural, too. This night work is an old-fashioned idea,
and wants stopping. When the masters say about day-
work, “ It can’t be done,” they talk through the hat.
GOLD COMFORT.
MRS. MACNAMARA : We don’t want our boys to be taught
to fight with powder and shot; we want them to be a
comfort to us in our old age. —Daily Paper.
“ Yes, ma'am, y'orter're 'ad 'im taught, ma'am.”
Wanganui (M.L.) has contracted a bad
attack of Webbitis and sculling mania. It already
possess a Webh-street and a Tressider-road, and
it has recently announced to the universe in
general that the first female baby unfortunate
enough to be horn in Webh-street will be christ-
ened Webbina. And this folly while as yet
foolish parents are hanging their heads over the
madness of the Boer war, which caused innocent
and unprotected children to have to stagger
through life with such atrocious labels as “ Lady-
smith Roberts Kitchener Jones,” or “Hector
MacdonaldßulierMafekingßloemfontein Brown.”
Another awful instance of the indiscretion of
crazy parents occurred at Lyttelton (M.L.), the
other day, when the latest addition to the popu-
lation, a poor, defenceless little yirl , was loaded
with the name “Nimrod Shackelton.” In the
face of such utter lunacy, it seems time that chil-
dren were numbered and allowed to choose their
own names on reaching years of discretion.
Christchurch (M.L.) went fairly mad over
the departure of the Nimrod for the Antarctic, on
New Year’s Day ; but its recent return was the
occasion of some fine emotional writing, in the
best manner of the American journals. The ac-
count in the Christchurch Press was evidently
turned in by a reporter very much “intoxicated
with the exuberance of his own verbosity.” The
Nimrod was expected on Sunday, March 8, and
we are told that “Lyttelton simmered all day
Saturday with pleasurable anticipation,” while
listening to the “ portentous deliverances of
ancient salts, grizzled longshore-men and
miscellaneous quidnuncs,” some of whom
“boldly declared that Monday morning
would dawn ere the famous craft and
her gallant company fetched the snug haven
where she would lie.” The return was touchingly
contrasted with the departure when the Nimrod
“ faded gradually away into the mysterious meet-
ing place of sea and sky.” The plain expression,
“horizon,” evidently wasn’t included in the
vocabulary of this high-flown scribe. The des-
cription of the actual arrival was particularly
lofty and sky-towering. The tiny vessel “took
more definite shape, rolling prodigiously in a con-
fused tumble of murky water,” and came “nearer
and still nearer as the seconds raced into the
storehouse of time.” Also, “the tug ranged
affectionately alongside, as a mother sheltering
her offspring.” All this flam was merely the re-
sult of the staff having drunk up the office dic-
tionary.

Writes a man from Maoriland :
The Antarctic expedition has not turned out the
pleasant little picnic that was anticipated. Rough
weather all the way to the ice, and thereafter continual
argument between Shackleton and England, the joint
commanders. While still down at the depot, the second
mate got his eye poked out. More rough weather all t>e
way back. On arrival at Lyttelton, Rupert England,
master mariner, threw up his billet “on the ground of
ill-health.” The first mate has no captain’s ticket, and
the second still has his eye out. There are no other ice
navigators known to be around Maoriland. A climax
came when all hands and the cook refused to go back
unless England went in command of them. The local
papers have steadfastly refused to publish any comments
on these happenings. Maoriland was so inflated over its
Antarctic expedition that it hated to even hint that
everything in the garden wasn’t heavenly—the same as
when the Lord walked in Eden in the cool of the evening.

An official of Melbourne Board of Health
lately went down into the kitchen of the Metro-
politan Mission, in Bourke-street, seeking that
cleanliness which is nominally adjacent to godli-
ness. He found some corned beef. At least it
had once been beef, but when the Board of
Health’s man sighted it, it had got over being
beef and was just a Smell. Several dinners had
been cut from the Disaster but, as none had
been eaten, the inspector seized all the Horror
the establishment contained. “Seizing” in this
instance probably means that he held his
nose with his hand —or with both hands
—and kicked the meat with his feet.
After his nose had regained consciousness, the
Board’s man staggered on a bit further and found
a cauldron. The fumes that emanated from this
implement were not so much a Smell as an endless
Howl for the Tomb. The cook’s voice was heard
in the murk explaining that it was Soup. The
official nerved himself to a supreme effort and
looked over the edge. Down below he saw a pool
of greasy water, a mass of ancient bones, and flies
—flies innumerable. An anguished inquiry
brought forth a response from the cheerful cook
that the ghastly mass really was intended for
human beings. “ They’re not particular,” said the
Bone-boiler of the Christian Mission. “ Most of
the bones are good ; but we keep back the flies ! ”
The inspector waited to hear no more. He
arrested the whole Calamity with a clothes-
prop and rushed it away to the cool stores
to be preserved as evidence. But the manager of
the cool stores smelt it coming, and banged the
door. He also urged them to shoot the meat at
once and put it out of its misery. It is all pain-
fully suggestive of the ways of the Church. The
» Church commenced over 1800 years ago by lodging
* its bitter protest against Pagan cleanliness. It
made dirt a virtue, and loam in the whiskers a
sign of grace. It got to such a point that some of
its best saints were black all over, and the chances
are that Mercia, of “The Sign of the Cross,”
never had a real, square, honorable, complete
wash in her life. And the Church has never yet
become quite sanitary, nor has it wholly got the
fly out of the soup to this day.
“ M.” : A par in B. (12/3/’08) reminds me.
Travelled or untravelled, a certain class of white
female is always attracted by the shiny nigger.
Helped my down-on-his-luck dad to run a Sydney
hotel once. It was a decidedly second-rate show,
and amongst the boarders were two niggers. One
was the husband of a white woman of alleged
noble birth (there were two opinions about that),
and the chosen plaything of a lady who later pro-
duced a remarkable book. A more despicable,
evil-tongued creature than this nigger never lived ;
yet the woman he married adored, him. The
other darkie performed acrobatic feats with his
mouth at a music hall. The number of bleached-
headed, silk-skirted, painted women who streamed
in to see that uniquely ugly nig. was truly
astounding. One stumbled over them on the
stairs, in corridors and sitting-rooms, and the lift
was continually on the go. But the most irri-
tating thing about it all was the contemptuous,
grinning way the nigger dodged those white
women.

A certain amount of open-sea bathing goes
on along the foreshore between St. Kilda and
Black Rock (Vic.), and a bad man, very
anxious to learn, might, if assiduous in
watching, discover at odd night
moments, and in quiet covered
places, certain batches of mermaids
frisking in the sea without gar-
ments of any kind, regulation or
otherwise. A set of professional
youths indulging in a week’s picnic
in a ski 11 ion in the ti-tree beyond
Sandringham found that certain
brave damsels from a house over
the hill were in thehabit.of float-
ing in the moonlight. One n.ght
lately, after • the usual paddle
and splash, the mermaids were dis-
gusted to find an abominable man
creature sitting among their
dressing gowns on the white
sands. The girls squealed,
and stood out to sea, and
from a safe distance they
heaped scorn and con-
tumely on the villain who
barred the way out. The
villain did not turn a
hair. The mermaids dived,
and brought up missiles,
and hurled them at the
unsanctified invader, but
the invader did not seem
to mind. Nothing could
shift him. In their dire
extremity the bathers
put up a united scream
for succor, and after
they had been scream-
ing some time their
male relations and
friends came run-
ning with guns
and clubs, and
fell upon the/
unauthor-
ised strang-
er on the
sands, and
broke him in
four pieces before
they discovered he
was an articulated ar-
tist’s model—a wooden man
packed in an old suit. A black feud existed be-
tween the skillion in the scrub and the house over
the hill when the mail left.

Wellington (M.L.) engineer Charles Seager
recently told a rather humorous yarn about the
fetich worship of imported goods. A steamer
named the Wongawonga having been towed into
Wellington minus a propeller, the ship-chandlers
and johnnv-all-sorts emporiums were ransacked
for some old imported article to replace the lost
gear. When it became apparent that there was
not in all Maoriland a ready-made English pro-
peller that would fit the Wongawonga, it was
decided, as a last desperate resource, to get one
made locally, with a view to keeping the steamer
earning a crust till a new whirly thing could be
got from England. A local engineer made one
and fitted it on the shaft without any fireworks.
The old tub got going, and the skipper nearly fell
down dead with shock, for, when he signalled
“ full speed ahead,” the steamer went off with a
bound, and ran up to nine knots, whereas the
former maximum speed had been a shade over
five. “ Not so bad for a colonial ! ” was the gene-
ral remark. During the time the new propeller
was being imported, the steamer pottered about
the coast at a fair average of nine knots an hour,
but as soon as the imported thing arrived and
was fitted, the old tub’s pace dropped back to
seven, and remained at that permanently.
“().” : Archdeacon Gunther, as Vicar-
General of Sydney, has issued circulars to immi-
grants, inviting them to make themselves known
to the clergy and avail themselves of 4< ever-ready
counsel and assistance.” Which has had result in
one instance, anyway. A one-time cleric who
frequently visits the city in demonstrative ecclesi-
astical attire, encountered two late arrivals from
Shropshire just after they had perused one of the
circulars. He explained to them that with a little
capital he could put them on to an immediate
fortune The ex-parson is only a faddist, with
wild schemes for growing rubber on sandflats, and
making book-coveis out of rabbit’s ears, but he so
impressed the arrivals that they started off with
him that afternoon by train. They were half-way
to Dubbo when the pale shadow of doubt ob-
truded. Next day they took passage back to
Sydney, only damaged to the extent of travelling
expenses and loss of time. But they have ahaunD
ing suspicion that the ever-ready counsel of the
clerical profession is a broken reed to lean upon.
It looks as if the opium-smuggling busi-
ness will presently be wiped out, in the
way that might have been expected, bv
local production. Already it is said certain
Gippsland Chow gardeners are making prepara-
tions to grow heavy crops of poppies, and the
manufacture of the drug therefrom is not a diffi-
cult process. Heaven knows why Victoria should
have" been chosen for the scene of operations, that
State having already made it an offence for any-
one not a licensed chemist to even possess opium.
Possibly John reckons it easier to circumvent
the State authorities than the Customs, and there
he isn’t far out. As a circumventor the Chow
has no equal on earth, and Victoria’s reform
measures are easily dodged, owing to insufficient
and ill-paid police, and aged J.’sP. of weak
intellect.
THE VOICE OF
CONSCIENCE.
MURIEL : “ I went to the theatre this morning to
have my voice tried.”
ERMYNTRUDE : “ And was it found guilty?"
The Day Dawn Chronicle (W.A.), of
February 15, told a dismal tale of a camp of
Italian laborers at Nallan. “ They were living
more like blacks than members of a civilised
race,” said the sorrowful Chronicle. Their
story may be condensed thus : They didn’t wash,
either themselves or their clothes. Every-
thing—rags, bones, scraps and sundries —
just lay and festered where it dropped,
and .apparently it dropped as near to
the well as possible because it was handier to
camp right there than to fetch water. The wind
blew things and the rain washed things into the
well, and it was covered with a thick green scum,
which no Italian ever cleaned off. A smell rose
like a rampart round the camp, yet even
when fever broke out the sons of Italy didn’t
wash, or clean up, or bale the scum
off the well. Dirt was second nature to them,
and being mere guileless children of nature they
never connected the fever in the camp with the
towering battlement of stench around it. And the
degenerate Italian is like that pretty nearly every-
where ; since Pilate the Dago did that famous
wash, his countrymen seem to have acquired a
prejudice against water. Westralia imported a
vast amount of cheap Italian labor in earlier days,
and sometimes it thinks that the Dago toiler is a
blessing, while oftener it doesn’t.
Again the solemn warning appears in the
wild Cat column of the Barrier Minek
(Broken Hill. N.S.W.)
lf the girl who has been scandalising me

Australia keeps up its export of claimants
and frozen rabbits. The rabbits are frozen here,
and the claimants generally go away and freeze.
Last week still another alleged heir to the Page
Millions turned up—in S.A. this time. How
many this makes it is hard to say; but if this
writer was a stockman, starting from the Gulf
with that drove of claimants for a southern
market, he would want to inquire pretty anxiously
about the water supply ahead.

The lawless habits acquired in South
Africa stick all right. At Charleville (S.A.) one
of those who, in the Boer war days, “ helped to
rob the wounded, helped to count the slain ”
lately got three months for stealing a ring from
the clothes of a drowned drover.
THE UNSEEN
WIDOW.
IHE LITTLE WIDOW: “ Doesn't your wife object
to us being seen so much together?”
THE GAY DOG: “ Oh, a little! But it's the times
we aren’t seen that worry her most.”
Now that the expected arrival in the Com-
monwealth of the Dudley twins will tend to make
lose unintentional circumstances popular, it may
e interesting to recollect that, for some in-
scrutable reason, Westralia is about the most
requent place on earth for twins. It easily
eads the other States in the matter, anyhow.
According to Statistician Knibbs’ latest figures,
t-i -t? ver y SWO Westralians, one is a twin;
vie. boasts one in 7330; 8.A., one in
TfS., one in 9130; N.S.W., one in
n d Queensland has only a twin to every
0,000 inhabitants. The State that accumulates
wins at the alarming rate shown in Westralia
sn t necessarily increasing its population twice as
ast as, say, Queensland—the latter’s birthrate is
just now 27.97, as against Westralia’s 30.62 ; still,
when the two little strangers happen together,
uey help the tally on somewhat. As to the
reason of this tendency to drive babies in pairs,
perhaps Big John can explain. He is supposed
o know all about the capabilities and resources of
the Western State.

Dear Bulletin. —Maoriland has got a bad
attack of nerves just now, so be careful what you
put into your saintly paper during the
next few weeks. Taking into con-
sideration The Lone Hand
trouble, you’d better see that
everything intended for Welling-
ton is fully clothed. They
arrested a shark up there the
other day for daring to appear in
the harbor without a skirt on. Tell
Borman Lindsay to cover up his
model with a table-cloth for a few
weeks, or there is no knowing what
may not happen to him. Let it be
known far and wide that the Purity
Brigade of Wellington City is out
after scalps. Dulcie Deamer is to be
arrested shortly because she wrote a
yarn about naked people. Women
are not to be allowed in the streets on
windy days, because the wind has a
habit of showing up their forms.
Women are not to travel on tram-
cars because they frequently display
their ankles when alighting. The
following “ immoral ” words must
not be used in public, viz. , “legs,”
“form,” "outline,” “breast,” “'’bo-
som,” and “stocking.” Birth and
marriage notices must not be pub-
lished in the local papers because
they are of a suggestive nature. My
lady’s more intimate wear must not
be displayed in shop windows, and
the mere mention of the word “ py-
jamas” will get you three months
without the option. Cats, dogs and
horses must now be fully dressed, and
no woman must hold up her skirt
when crossing the street. All these
things are suggestive according to
Wellington. Yours mournfully,

The Australian newspapers that
want to encourage the idea that our
fellow-subject Ram Chunder, the Hindoo
coolie, is a nice, mjld person, without an
idea except to graft for the white sahib, really
shouldn’t keep correspondents in Fiji. For Fiji
is the place which has tried the policy that Bruce
Smith wants Australia to adopt in the Northern
Territory ; and the before-mentioned papers are
in consequence always printing things like this,
from Sydney Telegraph’s Suva correspondent -
The Indian coolie always keeps the criminal list well
filled, and there will be two cases for murder for trial at
the next Supreme Court Sessions. In one case Sirdar
Salaru chopped a woman’s head off, and at the estate of
Messrs. Elgood and Maclure, at Naikorokoro, an Indian
woman was hacked to death by a man named Badal, also
an Indian coolie.

“S.S.” writes :
I have listened to an old, well-known, and highly-
experienced Melbourne doctor commenting on a quaint
development in the modern woman. He says woman
begins to betray a morbid delight in operations ; that the
readiness with which our wives, sisters, cousins, and
aunts run to the lance, manifests an actual longing to be
messed about by the surgeon. It is astonishing and
utterly morbid, but cannot be denied. The patients cry
out for the knife even when the knife is not necessary or
long before the necessity has manifested itself, and the
cutting and carving are borne with a fortitude that mani-
fests amazing insensibility. Of course the craving is not
general, but it is common—so common as to suggest that
so far as the softer sex is concerned, science is bothering
itself quite unnecessarily about the new ansesthetic. ”
But is the thing new ? How many years of age is
that red-lamp story about the morbid girl-invalid
who prayed nightly that she “ might be found
worthy of operation ” ?
Treatment of Diseases by Means of Diet.—
So far as books are concerned, the most NATIONAL
production ever turned out in Australia is “The Attain-
ment of Health ; and the Treatment of the Different
Diseases by Means of Diet,” by Philip E. Muskett. The
same writer has now piled up no less than nine works
running- into 18 editions. This latest volume is an Aus-
tralian NATIONAL handbook of health, food and diet
There has been nothing of the kind printed here before"
nor has any book on similar lines ever been written in the
English language. The information it contains is simply
an eye-opener. Its dedication to the “ Greater Expansion
of our Food Industries ” shows that it includes matters
which are connected with the development and growth
of Australia. Altogether it is marvellous how 678 pages
of reading matter can be sold for 7s. 6d. The work is
handsomely bound in red cloth, with gilt lettering and
has just been published by William Brooks and Company
Ltd., 17 Oastlereagh-street, Sydney. It may be obtained
from ANY BOOKSELLER in Australasia ; or, if ordered
directly, will be sent, in its cardboard case, for Bs. 7d. to
any part of the Commonwealth or New Zealand.
Some people have no sense of humor.
Une Loblinck had the amazing folly lately
to sue publican Daws, of Benalla (Vic ) for
damages because Mrs. Daws declined to let’ him
and his mate sleep in her clean beds unless they
first washed themselves, they having just con-
cluded a long and dusty jonrney, and being, in
tact very dirty. Loblinck declined to wash so
now he has to pay two lots of Costs for the pleasure
of learning that in Australia the bath is something
or a national virtue.
THE CAY AND FESTIVE.
DOCTOR (absently, to his best-paying patient): “By Jove , old fellow, you'll hare to rein in
you re going the pace.”
“Mahlstick” writes, with an eye on the
catalogue :
After inspecting the 700 pictures from England in Mel-
bourne Exhibition, I agree with Hall, that there is no
urgent necessity to plunge on any for the National Gal-
leries. After all the fashionable crooning on the first
day, I found myself all alone in the show on the second.
Snowman’s portraits of King Edward and Queen Alexandra
w ill find a market somewhere at £lO5 each. Good enough,
but I would as soon have colored photos. J. K. Lawson’s
creditable architectural studies of the Horse Guards and
St. Paul’s are too dear at £350 each. The St. Paul’s would
be instructive for a national gallery at £lOO. “ The
Sailor’s Wedding,” by J. R. Reid, is nice, but too high at
£B4O. Would please S3’dne} 7 at £350. Reid is a veteran
gold medallist of Paris, Vienna and Munich. Calderon’s
“Queen of the Tournaments ”is not for sale. Lent by
the Salford Gallery on the principal of taking the least
risk. It cannot help being good w'ork, but—nothing in it.
“St. Monica’s Prayer,” by Schmalz, is priced £lO5O. I
recommend it for the National Galleries. Knock off a
hundred or two. Fine subject, Young Augustine sleep-
ing after a booze, and his mother kneeling. “Songs of
the Morning,” by Henrietta Rae. In her manner,
this is a nudity, on the principle of the fruiterer’s
shop with one shutter open on Sunday morning ;
too dear at £505. Not much edge on nudities bv women.
Suggestive of male ballet dancing. “Evening After
Rain,” by B. W. Leader. Not extravagantly dear at £630.
I recommend it. Published in photogravure. “Love
Steering the Bark of Humanity,” bv Watts. Decline to
give £l5OO for it. “'Savoy Pastoral,” by East.
Ambitious of a place in our National Galleries at £lO5O.
Good picture, but I don’t like it. “ Daughter of Herodias,”
by Watts, not for sale—thanks. “Still Waters Run Deep,”
by Fahey, not for sale. Wish it was ; knew' him directly.
Also in “He Never Came.” Nobody painted still w'ater
like Fahey. Not to say he was better than anyone, but
so peculiar—a trifle uncanny and treacly. “ Welsh River ”
and “ Sussex Coast,” by Leader. Buy'one of these little
pictures, for £6O, to hang over the mantel-
piece in your dining-room. “Diana,” by Kennington.
Somebody will give £315 for this, and keep it till he sells
it for £5OO. Three fleshlies, yet not nudities. Didn’t like
it at first. The Archbishop, possibly even the Cardinal,
will stand beside you and sav, “ Daring, but permissible.”
In short, it’s chaste. “ The Conception of the Cross,” by
Fahey, junr. Not dear at £2OO. Good for a church.
“ A Reverie,” by Dicksee, not for sale. Lent by Liver-
pool Corporation. Thanks for a good thing. “ Golden
Youth,” by T. C. Gotch, £7OO. Don’t like it. Appeals to
the fantastic —Madox-Brown-ewm-Cimabue. “Water-
loo.” by Wollen. Good and gory, and not excessive at
£5OO for the Jingoistic mind. I suppose it would have
been £lOOO while the Boer war was on. On a higher
plane is Woodville’s “Saving the Guns”—not for
sale. “Laus Deo,’by Solomon Solomon. Striking. Horse
splashing through water and bearing victorious man in
armor. Won’t give you £lO5O for it, Sol. Very enticing
frame, which may help a purchaser to carry it away, or
rather help a purchaser to be carried away. “ The Thames
from Richmond,” by Waterlow, £B4O. Oh 1 Tut, tut!
Give you £420. Excellent picture, but not up to Vicat
Cole. “ Spring Pastoral,” by Stanton, £3OO. Nearly
worth it. “Perseus and Andromeda” (Leighton),
£l2OO. Don’t invest. Too much depleted by the Corot.
A strained picture ; might go out of fashion. While ad-
hering to the opinion with which I set out, I think that
Joshua Lake has brought a great host of saleable pictures,
which will adorn the homes of Australia. Only the fancy
goods are conspicuously dear.

The strenuous husband turned up in Syd-
ney divorce court last week —or rather his
battered half arrived and alleged his exploits
with tnis moving evidence : A fortnight after
they had settled themselves in a home of
their own, he tipped up the table with the
tea-things on it. He then leaped on the bread
and the pie, and after dragging the bed from
underneath her, bore it off to a boarding-
house. An interval of seven days followed,
and then he asked his wife to return
to him ; which she did. He took another
house and bought some more crockery. But
the sight of unbroken goods was too much for
him and he broke out—or broke up—again. This
time the household props, looked as it they had
been through a quartz battery, and the' only
sound goods were the cat and the hearthstone.
Ihe kerosene lamp was almost being omitted but
he found it in time, and dashed it on top of the
ruins, and laughed _ the metallic laugh.
After this he left his wife several times,
hut ultimately they acquired more furni-
ture and resumed some more. Peace lasted
for a short while. Then the wife went out one day,
leaving the home intact, and when she got back
found her husband standing in the midst of empti-
ness and desolation. He informed her he had
sold up everything, and shook a quantity of money
in her face, snarling unpleasantly after the fashion
of a dog. During all this time he generally
beat her once a fortnight, and occasionally
dragged her out of bed by the flowing tresses.
He also hurled the lighted kerosene lamp at her,
and deserted her for good. And even then she
waited a good while in the hope that he would
return before she legally cast him off. Wonderful
is the patience of woman !
From sunrise to sunset were the working
Newcastle coal mines in the early days,
the place was then called King’s Town (from
Governor King), but the compliment was, as
usual, transferred to an English origin. The
Government claimed the sole right to raise coal,
and inflicted heavy penalties on private persons
or foreign ships that removed any without a per-
mit. If a foreign vessel entered the port without
a permit and took up a bucket of coal, Governor
King’s order was brief and emphatic: “Scuttle
her. Notwithstanding the long hours and low
remuneration of labor, coal raised at Newcastle in
those days was many times dearer than now.
Simeon Lord sent a cargo to Capetown, and it was
sold there at £7 a ton.

What kind of man was he whose heart

To show he came from far Cathay

The establishment of inter-State Freetrade and the
abolition of the inter-State Customs revenue shook up
the Tasmanian finances badly in 1902, and the latter
half of 1901, but even all the misgovernment that State
functionaries were capable of couldn’t prevent the good
effects of Federation asserting themselves. The Govern-
ment expects that next June will see the shortage cleared
■off, and thing's look brighter in the'Tas. cash-box than
they have done for many years. The trouble is that, when
the old jim-jam is really lifted off the public chest, Tas-
mania seems likely to repeat the folly which it committed
nearly a quarter century ago. It had a little accumulated
surplus then —if a little State which was steadily incur-
ring new loans, a lot of them for wholly unproductive
works that should have been charged to revenue, could
be said to have a surplus. The shockingly revolutionary
idea that Tassy might cease borrowing, or even pay off a
bit of its old debt, never occurred to the Government
of that day. It went round like a roaring lion
seeking for means to get rid of its surplus, and
it abolished taxes with so large and copious a hand that
it started a deficit which was to haunt the island for over
20 years. A few months hence, upon present appear-
ances, Tasmania will face the same situation again the
deficit will be paid off, and there will be a bogus or fraud-
ulent or swindling surplus, created by borrowing money,
and using it for revenue purposes, and putting the coun-
try’s future up the spout and its children in pawn. If
Tasmania has learned anything by long tribulation, it
won’t remit taxes this time, but will be decently honest
instead, and leave off borrowing, and make a payment of
at least £50,000 a year for new public works a permanent
charge on the revenue. And if 22 years of hard struggling
has taught it nothing at all, it will do the old foolishness,
and “ blew ” its little paper surplus on remissions of
taxation, the same as it did before.

Russell French, the boss Sydney banker, has
a grievance against theN.S.W. Government for abolishing
the stamp duty on cheques, though that Act was hailed
as a great reform. It appears that Egbert and Percy, up
in the ledger-keeper’s desk, are at it ail day dealing with
cheques of microscopic proportions. With no penny per
cheque to pay, the customers of the bank are raining
their little bits of paper on ihe bank whenever they want a
drink, or the evening paper, and are short of change.
Bussell French resents the idea of his bank being turned
into a sort of small, loose change establishment, and
there is the wear and tear on Percy and Egbert to be
considered.

The accounts for the earlier years were not very clearly
presented ; but for the past four or five years these
further results can be given:—

These reserves include sinking fund, £15,284 ; reserve
fund, £8234; and unappropriated profit, £579. The re-
serve fund is designed for the purpose of meeting excep-
tional expenditure, and to some extent, therefore, is not
a true reserve. For the present, however, all repairs,
maintenance, and renewals are being charged to revenue
account. It is pretty evident that this undertaking
gets nothing in the shape of spoon-feeding; on the con-
trary, it is even charged with one-third of the annual
allowance of the Mayor of Launceston—a very proper
thing, of course, if the undertaking requires a third of
the mayoral attention.
The depreciation allowance, or reserve fund
addition, amounts for the year to £2737, or about £1 13s.
4d. per cent, on the capital expenditure. Even allowing
that current renewals are being paid for so far out of re-
venue, this allowance looks very small ; for the renewals
are not heavy yet, the works being comparatively new.
The sinking fund is something entirely distinct. A reserve
or depreciation fund is for the purpose of providing
new machinery, etc., when the old wears out, with-
out adding to the capital account, or debt of the
undertaking ; the sinking fund is for the purpose
of wiping the debt out, thus recovering the real
ownership from the Cohen who lent the money, and trans-
ferrin" it to the municipality. A lot is talked about
“ municipal ownership ” ; but unless works are paid for
out of rates or other revenue in the first place, there can’t
be real municipal ownership without both a sinking fund
and a reserve (or depreciation) fund —one to pay off the
debt; the other to ensure that the municipality will have
something mere than scrap-iron when the debt is paid off.
The existence of a sinking fund does not, then, do away
with the need of the other reserve. The additions to
this reserve or depreciation fund work out as follows for
three or four years past :
Beserve Fund Capital Proportion to
Additions. Outlay. Capital Outlay.

1906 . 1509 160,843 018 9 ~

This is an average of £1 2s. 9d. per cent, for depreciation ;
and with works of this sort it certainly does not look
enough. That being so, the limit of concessions to con-
sumers has been reached, if indeed it has not been passed.
Any increase in profits ought not to be accepted
as a justification for reducing prices, which are so ex-
tremely low already that at the end of last year the
department had 3175 separate consumers, while the City
of Melbourne electric light and power undertaking had
only 2126. The average price obtained per unit last year
was for lighting 4'97d., for power 1'13d., and for heating
l’49d.

Trouble is apt to strike those friendly societies
that spend their time thinking up new and magnificent
names for unnecessary officers, and new sorts of unneces-
sary millinery to put on the unnecessary officers; and
when they are told that the trouble is just round the
corner, some of them get very angry. Recently J. JB.
Trivett, the N.S.W. Government actuary, laid hold of the
Foresters, and told them that, in the course of a thorough
overhaul of their affairs in this State, he had found they
were £61,420 short. To meet their engagements they
ought to have £27,787 more in the funeral fund
than there actually was in it, and £20,519 more
in the sick fund, and £13,114 more in the super-
annuation fund. In fact, the funeral fund (practi-
cally the life-insurance fund) was worth only 11s. Id. in
the £. Thereupon some of the people with the gorgeous
millinery upon them wanted to know what Trivett knew
about friendly societies, anyhow—how could he know
that there wouldn’t be enough money to pay the
members ? The majority, however, had sense enough to
see that something was wrong, so all the funds were con-
solidated, and the contributions were raised, and the
benefits were reduced. *

Though Federation is alleged to have played the mischief
with Tasmania, this Tasmanian bank, without a branch
outside the island State, has found it worth
while to make another issue of capital; and
upon the new capital (issued at 100 per cent, premium),
as well as upon the old, it pays a dividend at the rate of
12 per cent. As at Feb., 1901—about the time the alleged
Curse started —the capital was £141,492 ; the reserves
were £102,564 ; the dividend was 7 per cent. The capital
is now £175,000, the reserves £182,401, and the dividend
12 per cent. Either in 1900-1 old losses were calling for a
lot of wiping out, or the present business is infinitely
more profitable than the old business ; for the declared
gross profits were at the rate of £2 14s. per cent, of the
advances as at Feb., 1901, while now they are at the rate
of £4 os. 9d. per cent. Whether the latter rate can be
maintained is another matter. Certainly, the bank has
been strengthening its position during the last three or
four years, not only by large additions to reserves, but by
what amounts to the same thing—writing down premises
account by good solid lumps. Still, between the rapid
increase of dividend and the increase of capital which
carries the increased dividend, the Commercial of. Tas-
mania has set itself a stiff job if it aims at maintaining
the 12 per cent.
The accounts now presented compare with those
of 12 months ago in this way :
Feb., 1907. Feb., 1908..
Notes and bills .. £55,967 £64,177 Inc. £8,210

Advances .. ..1,350,334 1,451,720 Inc. 101,386
Premises .. .. 38,326 37,557 Dec. 769
The decrease of deposits, combined with the increase of
advances, reduces the liquid assets to such an extent that
they now represent only 30 per cent, of the debt to the
public ; and, under ordinary circumstances, nothing at all
less than that is regarded as safe. That being so, the bank
is probably now earning as much as is safely possible
with its present resources. Moreover, both the mineral
and the wool business, on which Tasmanians so largely
rely, don’t feel as well as they did a while ago ; and
that may affect profits. What the earnings have been on
the basis of capital and reserves can’t be said absolutely,
because of the new capital which has been coming in at
various times lately; but, on the basis of capital on
which dividend is paid, combined with reserves as at the
beginning of each half-year, these are the recent figures :
Aug., 1904 .. £9 11 op.c. Aug., 1906 .. £9 6 0 p.c.
Feb., 1905 .. 9 9 8 „ Feb., 1907 .. 914 10 „

Feb., 1906 .. 717 10 „ Feb., 1908 ..10 8 3 „
The increase of capital and reserves (from premiums) has
strengthened the position from the depositors’ point of
view ; the total public debt is now only four and a half
times greater than the shareholders’ funds, as against a
proportion of 7tol in several Australian banks. And of
course the shareholders’ capital and reserves are the fund
which guarantees to depositors the repayment of their
money, wherefore the bigger the fund in proportion to
liabilities the better they are secured.

The Union Trustee Co. is, so far as The Bulletin knows,
the only Australian trustee co. working in more than one
State—it has a board and a manager in Queensland, as
well as in Victoria, where the head office is. The paid
capital is large for a trustee co. ; £73,822 (or £1 per share)
has been called up, and shareholders are liable for a
further 10s., and another £1 in case of liquidation. For a
trustee co., again, the liability is therefore light. The co.
sets out its securities in considerable detail, and alto-
gether they seem to be a good lot. Of £80,955 of assets
(there are no liabilities apart from uncollected dividends,
£35) only £9059 is in real estate, and £22,506 is in mort-
gages ; the balance is in cash, public stock, and similar
assets. The size of the capital, and the quality of the
assets make fine security for the co.’s clients ; and though
that in the long run should bring business and profit, for
the present these things mean a comparatively small
dividend.

On the strength of the five-year lease to Meynell and
Gunn—who nowadays are also John Wren and Rupert
Clarke —the co. has got back to the div.-list. Still it
hasn’t got rid of the overdraft which it acquired in 1904-5
in connection with the reconstruction of the theatre.
Moreover, though the theatre is leasehold, and a lease is
a wasting asset, the same item has stood in the balance
sheet for three or four terms —“ Leasehold properties,
£21,002.” As it seems certain that this ought to be
gradually written down to nothing out of profits, the
true profits are rather less than the accounts
represent them, unless additions have been made
to the properties out of profits, and there is no
sign of that. The co.’s ground rent runs to £9OO per year.
The ground landlord is a person who knows nothing of
fluctuations in box-office receipts, but calls round regu-
larly for his rent no matter whether it rains or is fine.
Practically, therefore, this rent is the same as a 5 per
cent, cumulative pref. share-issue of £lB,OOO. The over-
draft has now been reduced to £5083 : at the end of 1905
it was £9078. Miss Coppin (now Mrs. Geo. Rignold)
used to have a seat on the Board of this co.; but she has
resigned and a mere man takes her place, and almost the
only sight of a lady that the Wild Cat Column ever had is
consequently blotted out.

There is something very informal about this cleaning-up.
On 31st January, 1907, the co. had a paper item “ Plant
Deficiency Account, £6128.” (On the other side there
was £9B of undivided profit, and by deducting this from
the Plant Deficiency Account The Bulletin arrived at
the net deficit of £6030.) Then the co. wrote off £12,500
which, apparently, should have wiped off the deficiency
of £6128 and left areserve of nearly £6372. As a matter of
fact, it caused no visible addition to the reserve. Thereport
doesn’t say what the co. did with the £6372 ; the amount
simply disappears. Apparently the co. found another
deficiency of £6372 that it hadn’t mentioned (either an
old one, or one which had arisen during the year), or else it
wrote down its assets by that amount on general principles
and by way of looking forward, after the “ forehanded ”
manner of the cannibal who planted mustard and cress
when he heard that a new missionary was coming.
This view is partly borne out by the fact that in 1907, 12
steamers, 15 barges, and plant, etc., at 38 offices stood for
£38,240 ; while in 1908, 20 steamers, 22 barges and plant,
etc., at 40 offices only stood for £37,297. Apparently,
over and above the acknowledged deficit, the old barges
and steamers were written down in a strenuous fashion.
The year has been a good one on paper and in a
certain sense ; but with 15 extra vessels earning money,
and so much depreciation provided for out of capital, and
consequently not chargeable to current earnings, it cer-
tainly should be so. Even then the gross profits had to
be charged with £2760 for repairs to plant, and an
unknown amount for bad and doubtful debts and deprecia-
tion. The situation (condensed) is that after apparently
charging to capital £6372 of depreciation not previously
mentioned, the co. managed to show a nominal net profit of
£6731—-which looks like a real net profit of £359. If the
balance-sheet of 31st January, 1907, with its acknowledged
deficiency of £6128 in the valuation of the plant, showed
the real state of the case at that date, then either theco
has been providing: for depreciation that has not yet hap!
pened, or the results of the allegedly good year which has
iust closed are not far short of awful, and only a fraction
of the dividend has been really earned. It looks.as if
the business of racketting up and down Australia’s Big
Trickle with 20 steamers and 22 barges is a fairly pre-
carious business. Even now the accounts show a robust
overdraft, which seems to be the company’s normal con.
dition.

It all depends on whether the £41,667 of reserves which
were capitalised are treated as capital or as reserves.
Either way the dividend is all there.
The figures represent a splendid state of pros-
perity, but they also suggest that the co. had better be
content with things as they are, and not expect the boom
to crow larger and larger all the time. The profits are
less than they were in 1901, 1902,1903,1905, 1906 or 1907.
That is one point that is worth looking at. Another is
that the reserves are practically all buried in the business;
on February 29, the cash on hand was less than £9600,
and the half-year’s dividend declared was £10,500. There
is no nest-egg of State securities or anything like that.
The following table shows the situation in more detail
1897. 1906. 1907. 1908.

General expenses.. .- 6,816 11,163 9,865 10,990
These figures show that the liabilities are growing; the
amount of beer on hand is growing ; the amount buried
in beer-buildings is growing ; the advances are growing a
little ; the expenses are growing a little ; and the gross
profits are very nearly stationary. It might be a fair
thing to cut 24 per cent, off the glorious dividend, and
start to pile up a little heap of State securities against a
rainy day when the thing that drops gently from Heaven
isn’t beer.

M.T. : See par. B. 5/3/’OB J.L. : Certainly
“ metals must look up from their present low values,”
but there is quite a lot of room for them to look down
first. In some cases the values are still above the average
of the last 10 or 20 years, and only look low in comparison
with recently absurdly high figures. Don’t recommend

Dodder : The investment is good. The trouble is
that the wandering agents who come round with these
romote securities for sale are so very apt to just print
their own bonds as they go along. Better have nothing
to do with them unless you can go to Europe and buy
yourself. There is no more need to hawk that city's

ballast has gone overboard. The profits have improve
greatly, and the accounts have become a little more clear
and definite. Still there is room for improvement in tne
form of these accounts. For instance, the 1 per cent. Donu

with the bank interest. The accounts oughtto snow

£1668, and out of this a bonus of 1 per cent, is paid
shareholders and £165 rebate allowed to borrowers, nivi-
said £165 isn’t, properly speaking, either profit o
dend, consequently- the real profit, after paying tn r

1 per cent, bonus to shareholders, is £1503. And, ,u e

The Aerial Tramways which have been erected
for the British and Sulphide Corporation (Central) Mines
at Broken Hill are fine examples of present-day skill and
technical knowledge. The Mines will effect considerable
saving by means of these Aerialways as compared with
any other known mechanical contrivance for handling
ores on a large scale. The British Mine will economise
to over 2s. per ton. These two plants have already been
subjected to severe t ests, and have amply demonstrated
their worth and ability. Both Aerialways were supplied

After conducting exhaustive tests in the con-
centration of the ores at the Broken Hill South mine, the
manager, Mr. Wainwright, has finally decided to instal
the Wilflev type of table, modified in the direction best
adapted to his particular local requirements. The great
advantage with this type of table is that it admits of so
many slight variations which adapt it to meet all classes
of pulverised ores. Provided the pulp for treatment is
graded it can be used to treat all varieties of ore from
slimes up to coarse grades. When treating slimes and
lightly mineralised ores, care must be taken to have the
slope of the table accurate, and a fine, smooth dressing
surface beyond the feather edged diagonal termination of
the riffles. When treating coarsely ground ores or ores
heavily charged with mineral, as at the Broken Hill South,
the riffles or grooves can be carried further along the table
and m some instances right up to the concentrates dis-
charge end. Mr. Wainwright ordered six tables as an
experiment, with fewer riffles or grooves than customary,
and with some of them—the lower ones—carried to the
extreme end of the table. So successful has this type of
Wilfley table proved that he has ordered 50 more from
the Austral Otis Engineering Company. This same firm
has been placing several of the patent'Callow Screens at
Broken Hill and elsewhere. This ingenious and simple
mechanism has solved the problem of grading prior to
concentration.* [5

Hquid. Possibly there is no need for liquid assets
with the class of business the institution does,
ko far there have been no losses, which is a eleven
years’ record and speaks remarkably well for the manage-
merit. The addition to reserves is the biggest up to date
but £3748 of reserves have now to carry the possibility of
depreciation on £71,694 of advances, so they are really
humping- a bigger responsibility for their size than did the
£2734 of reserves a year ago ; in other words, they are
really smaller reserves, for the work that they have to do
than they were a year ago. Therefore there are the best
of reasons for not raising the dividend and bonus beyond
6 per cent., so that the reserves may have a chance to
grow. The institution now reckons itself big enough to
have a pup, and its members have created The Security
Trust Co. as a side issue. Its first balance-sheet isn’t due
yet, but the report says that it will last while Toowoomba
lasts, and grow while Toowoomba grows. It says this in
italics, too.
The unfortunate N.S.W. loan has brought to
pass the usual State-Commonwealth disagreement.
N.S.W. asked for £3,000,000.at 3£ per cent. It was a
renewal loan, and it must be remembered that
N.S.W. actually reduced its debt during the year
ended June, 1907 ; also, that the States in
general put in the plug so unusually hard
that the aggregate debt of Australia and Tasmania onlv
increased that year by the comparative trifle (for us) (if
£1,721,907, Also, N.S.W. borrowed big sums in 1901
and 1903 at £3 os. 4jd. per cent., and at that
time looked a much worse place than it does
now. So, if Bull had the money, a per cent, loan
,at par seemed about the safest thing going. Still
there were so many doubts about Bull having the money
that it was thought necessary to have the loan under-
written which simply means that certain capitalists
undertook, for a consideration, that they would take up
the loan if the public didn't. And but for that pre-
caution the downfall would have been terribie, for
the public tendered for £360,000 and left the underwriters
to take up £2,700,000. William L.vne expressed his regret
“ Cie loan not being a success,” and as it was his ow n
State he was talking about, it is quite sure the remark
was strictly true. Then Wade and Waddell rose to
resent. Lyne’s remark, and to wave the reddened shirt
of recrimination. But it seems to this paper that this
is no time for waving the blanky shirt of recrimination.
Here is the situation :
(1) N.S. W. is the most populous and most affluent State
in the Commonwealth. It isn’t so heavily indebted per
head as Queensland, S.A., Westralia or Maorilund. It
has lately shown an unusual desire to be sober and honest,
and for one year, at least, it didn’t add a penny to its debt.
Its revenue is booming, and it has a big surplus (paper or
otherwise) in view.
(2) It wanted money for renewal purposes only, and it
offered higher interest than it used to pay—higher than
tne rate at w'hich even Westralia has borrow ed in old days.
(3) Its loan, but for the underwriting business, would
have been an incredible failure.
(4) Now, what is the prospect for States that are poorer,
less populous, and more deeply indebted than N.S.W. —
States, too, that want not only to renew old loans,
hut to float new ones? For if such things as this
are liable to happen, underwriters won’t take on
the contract of guaranteeing Joans. Yet unless there is
a stupendous reform in this country’s financial methods it
must float new loans as the old ones fall due, or else burst.
What will happen when Bull hasn’t got the money?
* * * *
The recent appearance of ore in Thompson’s
shaft of the British Broken Hill, at a depth of 725 ft., bears
out to some extent the supposition that the fine ore body
which has been carried in the SOOft. drive from Howell’s
shaft passes to the east of Thompson’s. Where the lode
goes to after that can only be conjectured until develop-
ment is started at the lower levels of Thompson’s shaft.
If past experience is a reliable index, the ore body will
pitch away north, following the deviation from its true
course which the main lode has made in passing through
the Junction property. On the other hand, the ore
body may continue its present apparent course in
a north-easterly direction, and in that case entirely
new developments may he expected. The drive in w hich
this vagrant shoot of ore was picked up has been run out
from Howell’s SOOft. plat to connect with Thompson’s in a
straight line, and the fact of ore being carried in it for
nearly 200 ft. without either wall making its appearance
is sufficient reason to go nap on its being something big.
At about 965 ft. in, an intrusion of poorly mineralised
ground appeared, but this w as passed through after Bft. of
driving, and good ore again filled the face. A problem
which has not yet been solved is : How did such a large
body of ore escape the diamond drill that was kept so
actively at work in the lower levels of the British up to
12 months ago ?
It was a pity for the Broken Hill Junction
shareholders that the slump knocked the bottom out of
the finances before the manager was able to say for
certain whether there was a bottom in the mine or not.
King’s shaft, at the time of shutting down, was beginning
to excite a suspicion that an ore body was concealed
about it somew'here. and now that there is every indi-
cation of the new' British lode making across the few
hundred feet of space between Thompson’s and King’s
shafts, the suspicion is deeper than ever. King’s shaft is
down 175 ft. below the 300 ft. level, and ore was
carried in the shaft for a considerable distance, and
appeared to be making into the Junction property.
On the 300 ft. level the British, a few feet away
on the other side of the boundary, carried good ore
for a considerable distance south, driving on it from King’s
shaft, of which the British had a temporary lease. If this
body is pitching north into t e Junction, the latter may
vet become a large enough producer to make a profit even
with lead at £l4. At the old dot-and-carry-one gait, it
wasn’t to be expected that the Junction could make
profits, except when lead rose to an abnormal figure.
But if the manager is given a chance to open up the
mine, so that he can get a decent tonnage w'hen the time
comes for resuming productive operations, something
may yet be made of the old derelict.
Poor old Junction North mill (Broken Hill) con-
tinues to limp along with the procession of the halt, the
lame, and the blind. One big week’s run seems to knock
all the energy out of the shaky old concern, and leave it
in a wheezy state for weeks together. As for the mine, it
is improving in appearance. Although the ore it produces
is not of so tractable a nature as that won in the North
and South mines, it is not so bad as the erratic mill work
would make it appear to he.
■n ■# * ■*
The Zinc Corporation is making a game struggle
at Broken Hill to get its rather unreliable mount safely
over the next fence. A couple of bad croppers have
already been experienced, and if the old nag falls
again he will probably have to remain down. It
was figured out that if the Elmore machines
put through 600 tons of tailings per day the
plant would be on a profit-making basis. Hitherto that
tonnage has not been attained. It was found that
sufficient provision had not been made for settling the
slimes, and extra settling tanks had to be erected. Then
there is the old question of costs in connection with the
table separation of zinc concentrates from the Elmore
machines, which have not yet been reduced to a com-
mercial basis. In spite of protestations to the contrary,
tlie last fence still looms an ugly obstacle in front of the
2ine Corporation.
* * * *
The Broken Hill South mine has almost ceased
development work, and is employing only about half tlie
number of men it did six months ago. Much incon-
venience has been caused on the mine owing to the
difficulty experienced in making suitable arrangements
for the disposal of concentrates. These have accumulated
in the storage bins to the extent of over 1000 tons. The big
new mill is practically ready for a start, and if it were not
for the check given by the ore-buyers, it would very soon
oe turning thousands of tons of ore into dividends for
the shareholders. No trouble or expense has been spared
to make this mill perfect, and if the exhaustive experi-
ments, w hich have been conducted in the old mill during
the past two years, have been of any value,-the new plant
should not require much adjustment.

W einert ’ s siWer.iead B h ow near Herberton
(£. Queensland) is among the few profitable lead shows
thereabouts. The lode is sometimes only 18in. wide, but
0t £ *>c,S ade ’ 1121 tons of ore returned 471 tons of lead
and 62,8090 z. of silver. In spite of high costs, freight,
and returning charges, a dividend of £3OOO was paid.
1 vij ls ,dea M> a t a mine with rich ore is able to show
a bolder front to the metal market than a low-grade con-
cern, but the heavy expense of working a narrow vein in
an out-of-the-way lofcality reduces the margin of profit on
rich ore, so Wemert’s is hit rather hard by the slump in
ead and silver. A drop of £5 in lead is equivalent to a
loss of £2 a ton on 40 per cent, ore, and Weinert’s cannot
afford to have £2 a ton chipped off its profit. N. Queens-
land mines are not in such high favor as they were, and
the reason is not far to seek, for the depreciation in the
value of metals vastly overlaps the amount paid in divi-
dends. The Walsh and Tenaroo district for 1907, pro-
duced £876,634 worth of metals, out of which £60,932
was paid in dividends. Some of the dividend-payers were
O.h Mount Molloy, Vulcan, Gilmores, Dalziells, Smith’s
Creek, and Weinert’s (silver-lead). All of them, bar Gil-
more s, have had a neck-breaking drop in market value,
things are, however, sounder than they would appear to
be on a dividend basis. Mungana, Chillagoe, and Stan-
nary Hills made more profit than the dividend-payers did.
‘‘ M-C.” : Manager Nicholas, of the Stannary
Hills (Queensland) tin mines, has been in Adelaide, and
that may help to account for a revival of interest in that
concern. It has been explained that with tin at £lBO
profits have been considerable, but the co. has been pay-
ing some of its debts, and it must be acknowledged it
seems to have a big dead horse to work for yet. The last
issue of scrip was underwritten, and give a prior right to
ls. a share in dividends before the ordinary shareholders
get any show-. Nicholas speaks well of the Ivanhoe
w-hich has an ore-body 70ft. long and 30ft. wide, and worth
about 4 per cent, black tin—nearly double the average
extraction. Stannary Hills turns out tin concentrates of
high grade. The ore is crushed and concentrated to 30
per cent, tin, roasted, and then reconcentrated with
vanners, etc., to 70 per cent, metallic tin. At present
that is worth about £B4 in New England (N.S. W.), and
should be worth nearly £BO a ton at Stannary Hills. It is
quite evident, however, that the Vulcan tin concentrates
are not worth so much. The latest return was 1072 tons
for 59 tons 12cwt. black tin, valued at £2964. The Irvine-
bank tin co. does the crushing, roasting, re-treating and
smelting.
* » * *
Mungana is credited with 36 tons of copper in
the Chillagoe smelting return for February, ana as the
copper furnace was in blast for only 12 days and treated
124 tons of Mungana ore the figure looks big. But this is
misleading, because 27 tons of copper were obtained from
Mungana’s apportionment of matte, which is a by-product
of the lead furnaces. The roasting and converting of low
grade lead sulphide is more difficult than was anticipated,
and Chillagoe has had to increase its roasting plant and
obtain blowers and engines to cope with the larger
quantities coming forward from Mungana mines. Mun-
gana’s output is now about 1000 tons a month, and
Chillagoe doesn’t seem to have handled that quantity
lately. The Mungana mines are evidently subject to local
enrichment, and several portions of the mine have given
very high assays, but the output has to be estimated at
its bulk value, which is very different from testing a bit
in a crucible. No doubt the leaching action of water has
enriched some portions of the lode. Last year the Mun-
gana mines produced 550 tons of copper, worth £34,027 ;
2270 tons of lead, worth £30,998: and silver worth
£22,307 ; a total of £87,332. Profits would have to be big
on that output to pay ls. dividend (£25,000).

“Redoubt” : Mount Cannindah has now come to
the end of the £15,000 which it received from Bewick,
Moreing and Co. for 60,000 shares. It has also “ blown ”
the proceeds of its matte sales, which, with copper at
over £lOO for part of the time, amounted to something
considerable. Thomas Gibb came along the other day
with a proposition to work the property without liability
to the shareholders. Just as the shareholders were about
to meet, Thomas Gibb withdrew the proposition. What
the shareholders have a right to know' is: (1) Why
did Gibb make the proposition? (2) Why did
Gibb withdraw it? What some shareholders would
also like to know is : if Thomas Gibb can make
copper at Mount Cannindah at £39 3s. 9d. per ton, w'hv has
Mount Cannindah exhausted its cash ; why is it not making
huge profits, for best select copper is still over £6O per
ton ; and why is it not living riotously and getting itself
run in for midnight drunkenness? 8., M. and Co., from
the time that they were overridden as to the manage-
ment, have taken little or no interest in the concern ;
otherwise it is pretty certain shareholders would not
have got some of the ridiculous Cannindah estimates.
Reliable report has it that 8., M. and Co. sold
most of their shares to people with whom they must
have been glad to get even, and sold those shares at the
right price too.

Dear Bulletin, —Referring to the paragraph in
your last issue, re Mararoa ore reserves, your corre-
spondent has quite overlooked the fact that the returns
to the end of the second half-year did not include gold
won from the tailings, of which there are about 6000
tons on the mine, worth about 255. per ton. The cyanide
plant has been in full swing since the Ist January—the
returns being :
January, 1050 tons .. £lO2O
February, 1025 „ .. £llO2
Yours truly, A. Rutter Clarke.

Mitta Mitta (Vic.) is a dredge that ought never
to have been allowed to mar the stream whose name it
bears. Being-there, it is having its troubles. Machinery
breaks, time is lost, and so is money. Still for 15 weeks
the average was 230 z., and, as 15oz. should cover ex-
penses, there is presumably a margin of profit ahead.
But the overdraft is £l5OO, and if any pollution of the
river takes place then the Sludge Board will probably
make trouble. A bitter thing when roused, is the Board
of Sludge.

Long Tunnel (Walhalla, Vic.) got Bent safely
past the Devil’s Elbow into Walhalla and up on to the
tableland in safety. Bent, out of pure gratitude, pledged
himself to take the railway on to Stringer’s Creek. This
will help the Tunnel, which requires cheap firewood, but it
won’t help the State, which cannot afford to go on piling
up.debts on lines that aren’t likely to pay axle-grease.
Lone’ Tunnel directors now feel nearer to the rich shoot
that is underlying out of the Extended mine. They will
want the stone (when the new battery is pounding up the
scanty reserves) to justify a £5 value for scrip.
South Birthday is the poorest of a Berringa
(Vic.) trio, having turned out £98,137 worth of gold, and
had £17,652 capital sunk, but having only paid £lo,Booin
divs. It wound up the half-year with a debit of £l2lO,
the 4614 tons crushed having only panned out 7940 z. To
get to stone that may yield better returns the co. must
go south. What pays at Berringa is not the big quartz
lodes but the little patches that accompany so heavily
faulted a formation. The worst is that these patches
don’t occur so frequently at depth as they do higher up.

The Tasmanian Smelting Co.’s last annual
report (June, 1907) is only just circulated in Australia.
There was a profit on the Zeehan works of £6160, as
against £10,153 the previous year; but depreciation,
London expenses, etc., turned the profit into a loss of
£1534. Yet “ the directors consider that the important
xpenence gained during this and previous years will be
of great use to the co. in its future operations.” That is
the point that has to be considered in connection with
any proposal to pass the works on to the State. The ex-
-18 va * llal) l e 1 the works, on past results, are not.
bo if the eo. sells to the State the co. will take its experi-
TJn C i e h aV^ ay ’ and - '! vith the mone y ffot for the old works
will be in a position to establish new works elsewhere
incorporating the fruits of this valuable experience.

The newest manager of the Tasmanian Consols,
next door to the New Golden Gate, Mathinna, has not
been able to make the show look better than a patch v
stringer. Quartz is plentiful in two big- formations, but
gold won t show up in payable shoots. The co. is opening
up the reef from 400 ft. down to 1000 ft. to test the ground
there. New Golden Gate always coveted the Tasmanian
Consols, and only drove to the latter’s boundary when its
own shoot was petering out. The Consols crowd there-
upon sank straight to 1000 ft., but did not get gold till
1200 ft. was reached. The present hope is that shoots will
lengthen, which doesn’t often happen at depth. A drive
goes on from the New Golden Gate at 1800 ft. to find out
whether it is so in this case. J. Bull runs the mine, and
besides the pretty penny he has spent to get to 1600 ft
has just put up another £30,000.

Tasmania’s economical Hercules, at Mt. Reid
paid its fifth dividend (Is. per share) during the half-year.
This, with tax, ran away with £5407. The net profit was
however, only £3769, after writing off £1022 depreciation!
In the previous half-year net profit was £8276. The
shrinkage was helped by movements in that part of the
mine which yields the zinc-blende. This trouble drove
the men out and kept them out most of the half-year.
The co. has two contracts: one covering its sulphides
which it sends to the Zeehan works ; the other-
covering the zinc-blende (40 per cent, and over of zinc)
which goes to Germany. The half-year’s output
was 8527 tons of sulphide and 390 tons of zinc-blende.
Altogether the mine now- calls for very careful handling
as the pressure is tremendous, the old timber is pretty old’
and the existence of vughs and unfilled stopes constitutes
a standing danger. The good ore cut off bv the recent
collapse will later on be attacked from a lower level ; but
costs will necessarily move up. The directors were a
while ago foolish enough to shut up the mine for about
two years in a fit of pique, and that didn’t do it any good ;
for timbers won’t stop rotting even to oblige a Board of
Directors. The co., which has a paid capital of only
£3750, has £6221 in cash, besides a surplus of about £4OOO
other liquid assets.

New Brothers’ Home No. 1 (Derby, Tasmania)
comes out with a russet-tinted report that is as pretty as
the blush on the chairman’s cheek. The dapper cover,
how'ever, doesn’t quite conceal the hollowness within.
“ The low price of tin during the past six months has
affected the co.’s position.” If the second word was
away the sentence might pass. Tin hasn’t been low
in price for three years. What affects the co.’s
position in reality is the bump in the rim rock which
has thrown a slab of the bottom of the lead into the
Briseis ground. Work has not been bad during the half-
year ; 91,600 cub. yds. of drift to average over 51bs. of
stream tin yer yard should mean rattling profits, even if
there be an alleged poor price for the product—which
there wasn’t. It is rather a tough job to fog out the esti-
mate of what is left in the mine, but it looks as if there is
about a year’s good work. The mine may be made to last
longer than the market thinks, but the eiid cannot be very
far away.

Currie (of Lake and Currie) the English engineer
whose | report, with that of Ferd. Kayser, |helped little
Langford to float the Briseis, is visiting the mine.
Currie’s last trip was when he was man enough to
thoroughly revise the estimate previously given. With
Lindsay Clark at the mine there is no real need for Currie
to be paid a fee, but English directors like a Johnny at
their elbow to do work they ought to undertake them-
selves. Currie can only tell them what Clark has learnt
about the North Ringarooma lead, and his report will
trickle to Australia via London. The market teils that
it will be favorable, so holders needn’t worry about waiting
for the London board.
Central and West Boulder’s small block (Kal-
goorlie, W.A.) has long been looked upon greedily by
Golden Mile experts. Associated, under an agreement
made with some hesitation, undertook the exploration of
the north end from its 1000 ft. level. Later, this agree-
ment was replaced by one with the Oroya Co., which co.,
from its south block undertook to crosscut the area from
the 1500 ft. level. This crosscut has struck ore. Three
feet assays 30s. values, and the next 3ft., Iss. The
position indicates that this ore channel is the Australia
lode of the Associated.
Ivanhoe South Extended’s shaft (W.A.), which
is 2000 ft. deep, is now known as No. 3 shaft of the Golden
Horseshoe, since the latter co. purchased the property.
Manager Sutherland is now crosscutting at depth, and
the absence or presence of the main Ivanhoe lode within
the western ground should soon be settled definitely as
regards the 2000 ft. level.
With copper booming, the Mt. Cijttlin Co.
(W.A.) paid £lOO,OOO to Kaufman’s Phillip’s River Co. as
purchase money, and expended a further £34,776 in pro-
motion, equipment, development, etc. During the four-
teen months ended September last the ore developed
totalled 33,164 tons, estimated to contain 1643 tons copper
and 73450 z. of gold. The ore sent to smelter totalled
7524 tons, and returned £36,629, or £4 17s. 4d.
per ton. The copper contents (453 - 58 tons) real-
ised an average of £59 3s. 4d. per tori, and the
gold (24480 z.) realised £4 per oz. The costs of
production work out thus : Stopirig, 17s. per ton (£6636) ;
treatment, 68s. per ton (£24,671); and management and
administration costs, 16s. Bd. The total is thus £5 Is. Bd.
per ton of ore mined and treated. This shows a loss of
4s. 4d. per ton ; and, as development work and deprecia-
tion of plant had also to be provided for, the directors
report states the operations have resulted in a debit
balance of £B6BO. The value of the ore still in reserve
(25,640 tons) figures out at £3 13s. 5d., assuming that the
copper contents sell as “best selected ” at £63 per ton.
As matters stand, the Cattlin looks chilly for Kaufman s
followers.

Redhill Westralia Co., after a prolonged
struggle on the north shore of Lake Lefroy (W.Acquitted
that scene, and has since staked all its future on the
Higginsville properties, alongside the Coolgardie-
Norseman railway track. It is the largest shareholder in
the Sons of Erin mine, and the other two principal share-
holders are Graham Price (the co.’s attorney) and G. W.
Campion (the co.’s mine manager). Funds were none
too easy to get, so the co. has let out the Higginsville
mines to tributors, who are not only developing the pro-
perties, but paying a substantial royalty. This royalty
keeps the co. going.

Peak Hill Co. (W.A.) is not dead yet, though
times are changed since Darlington Simpson banqueted
the Westralian Governor on golden dishes. Last year the
mine kept 90 hands employed, did 5697 ft. of development
work, crushed at the 40 stamp battery 56,331 short tons
of ore for 65060 z. fine gold over the plates, and cyanided
18,144 short tons of sands for 1014 oz. more. Total value
recovered, £31,945 ; expended in wages alone, £19,205.
A new shoot struck at No. 5 level near Conder’s shaft is
showing fair ore.
Sailor Prince lease at Burtville (W.A.) has
been worked for some time past by Mandelstam, Wilkie,
Rodway, and the Great Ophir crowd, They were getting
ready to float it on the Adelaide market as a No-Liability
company when the fiasco of the Great Ophir itself spoiled
those plans. The lease is now under offer to another
syndicate for about £3OOO and a quarter interest. Some
very rich stone would appear to have been iately crushed
in the ramshackle little battery on the mine—at least it
is presumed to be rich, seeing that all water had to be
carted, and crushings must have cost at lease £2 per ton.
Record of the lease to date when the present owners took
it over is 3891 tons for 44080 z.
According to figures supplied to shareholders at
the recent meeting, the ore extracted from the. Asso-
ciated Northern (W.A.) up to December 31 last Vraa“heen
handled like this : Smelted, 20,771 tons for £665,822 ;
treated at a local battery, 9148 tons for £52,127 ; and
treated by the co.’s own mill, 163,871 tons for £697,092,
This makes a total of 193,790 tons for £1,315,041.

The power of beer was made strikingly
manifest in Maoriland the other day. A new
yardarm, 54ft. long, 2ft. through, and weighing
close on a ton, had to be taken up to the signal
station at Manakau Heads. A Maori put in the
lowest tender and got the contract. He was quite
unprepared for such work, having nothing in the
way of tackle or plant; but he had a very fine
knowledge of his countrymen’s chief weakness.
He arrived at the scene of operations with a cask
of beer on n sledge and followed by 25 burly
natives. The cask was taken up the 900 ft hill,
and the Maoris were informed in poetic language
that the beer would flow grandly, free, gratis, and
for nothing as soon as the yardarm arrived at the
signal station. With a preparatory war cry, the
Maoris set to work and cut a quantity of flax
which was quickly twisted into ropes. The way
in which that ton of kauri went up the side of the
hill bore witness to the great power of the beer
magnet at the top. #
“Cicfc” : Re “ 11.E.8.” (B. 12/3/’08) and
his sheep-dog, which filled the post of boundary-
rider on an out-back road in Otago. Hid
“H.E.8.” but traverse our own Riverina Out
Back he’d discover the same thing there, with
this difference—that the canine is tethered in the
centre of a three-chain stock-route track, and is
there for the express purpose of keeping an
adjacent cocky’s sheep on that road, so that the
grabbing wool-raiser may eat up the grass in-
tended for travelling stock, and save his own her-
bage meanwhile. The unfortunate quadruped
is tied to a peg with a chain, chiefly com-
posed of fencing-wire, and a score or more
yards in length, and is left to work and starve
and wail on his own for a week at a
time. Then on Sunday, after service, the embryo
squatter will drive that way, heave a few rabbits
at his slave, replenish his rusty kerosene tin at a
neighboring surface tank, and hand him a kick
in the ribs as a sort of reminder of work to be
done. After that the unfeeling wretch drives
home to a large Sabbath dinner, and the hairy
shepherd remains behind to haggle with the meat-
ants, crows, and travelling curs, for his bunnies,
which, in a day or two surround him with an
atmosphere of extreme and smellful solidity. And
the pity of it is that the faithful hound labors so
well and honestly for his wretched owner. The
average dog, ’tis said, will linger a full twelve-
months in this miserable state, exposed to all
weathers, and half-fed, and as his unhanged owner
observes, he’s far cheaper and more contented
than most men.

“ Janor” : Jobson and I had been up on the
Divide looking at a reef, and we returned to camp
by way of the creek bed, thus avoiding the dense
scrub on the spurs. The creek was dry, save at
the foot of the great bars of granite, every one of
which had at its base a deep pool of wet w'ater.
Spelling for a smoke on one of these ledges,
Jobson spied, some 10ft. below, a large snake
coiled on a projecting ledge. The reptile was
snoring. Ten feet lower down nestled a water-
hole, wide and deep. The water smiled. “See
me shift that black joker,” said Jobson. He
stood on the extreme edge of the bar, holding
in his hands a flat stone. When he had the
snake focussed, down whizzed the rock. Jobson
also whizzed. I heard the pool welcome him with
a Wagnerian crash as I scrambled along the
scrubby banks, thinking of first aid, inquests and
human folly. It took me much longer than it did
Jobson to reach the waterhole ; but I got there to
find that Jobson was not dead, but naked. He
contorted on the rocks, and with glaring eye
made wild attempts to see all over himself at
once. He answered my hail with—“ For God’s
sake come and find the dashed bite. I know I’m
bitten, for the snake and I were all tangled up in
the water.” But there was no sign of the snake’s
signature on Jobson’s skin. Still I couldn’t con-
vince him, and we argued the point while he
dressed. We’d still be arguing but for the finding
of the dead snake afloat in the pool. “What
price me as a shot? ” crowed Jobs On.
“ Gip ” the Bee-hunter :
I have always been anxious to see a wild bees’ nes.
robbed. There was promise of great excitement in it
A nest has been known to three bush friends of mine for
the past six months. The secret has been closely guarded.
One of the men discovered it by throwing a quantity of
flour on some stray bees collected on a sugar bag near his
home, and following them with head uplifted and 999
falls across a boggy creek and a couple of miles of moun-
tainous country to their lair. Try to follow a flitting
bush bee for ten seconds and think what a feat is that.
Yesterday an attempt was made to rob the nest. The
men said this was just the time, and it would be brim-
ming over with honey. I was there. With some diffi-
culty and guilty blushes I managed to borrow a pair of
leather leggings, and with greater difficulty walked in
them. I also wore my longest skirt, thickest veil and
gardening gloves, and carried well out from me a drip-
ping blue-bag. So as not to attract the population, the
men sneaked off quietly, staggering under tubs and axes.
I followed at a discreet distance. When we had covered
some miles of stony and hilly country and crossed sundry
squashy creeks, and there was no further danger of being
followed, I joined them. We came up to an enormous
and knotty gum, under which the men paused. It was
an interesting tree—it was so big and thick. “Monster,
isn’t it?” I remarked amiably to George. George struck
it vindictively with an axe.
“ This— this isn’t the tree?” I faltered. It would be
moonlight, certainly, but I wanted to get home before
midnight. George pointed out to me a bee or so hover-
ing near a small hole high up, and landed in again with
the axe. For some hours the men chopped, shedding
coats and vests and tempers, but sticking to their hats.
Meantime, I suffered the sensation known as watering of
the mouth. I felt sure that I smelt honey.
“ Look out! she’s on the balance,” shouted George,
with what breath he had left. I offered to make a sport-
ing bet as to which way “ she ” would fall, but the men
were too exhausted to notice me. With a groan and a
crash the giant lay down. George called out that the
bees were “ terrible tame.” I came up. A few listless
insects hovered round, disliking the smoke that rose from
the “ green ” fire the men had lit. The exhausted but
unbeatable George had started once more on the trunk ;
this time near the bees’ entrance. * ‘Are you going to
cut it through again}” I asked peevishly, looking at
the place where the sun had sunk. George nodded, and
hacked manfully.
Pale cream spiders, lettuce-green beetles with yellow
collars, long brown things with red whiskers, duck egg-
green centipedes and other wild fowl crowded surprisingly
out of the tree, but, as George said, the bees
were terrible tame. Night was nearly on ns
when George discovered some slices of empty
comb. Everyone was very tired George was cross. One
of the men pointed out a particularly knotty bit of trunk
and said he believed the honey was there, so George
started again to cut the trunk through. The smoke was
blinding him, and he had been chopping with a “ thick ”
axe since early in the afternoon. However, he cut it
through, not only there, but right up the trunk, and
when he had laid the giant open he discovered by the
light of a torch that the bees had deserted the nest and
owing to causes unknown it was empty. I have just
heard that George is getting on nicely. My temper also
steadily improves.
A FAIR EXCUSE.
“ Hey, Jacky, you lazy brute, go and do some
work; why do you let your lubra do all the
hard graft ?”
“ Ders on’y one axe, boss !”
The Maoriland Government has seriously
annoyed N.S.W. orchardists by classifying their
insect pests into groups and defining fruit as in-
fected by a particular group if grown within one
mile of an orchard where any member of that
group hangs out. If affected by a worm in the
first group, the fruit will he fumigated at the
owner’s expense and allowed to land. If a mem-
ber of the second group is present, the fruit will
receive drastic treatment hut will he allowed to
leave the Dominion. If the worm in the cases is
in the third class or group, the insect will he
taken firmly by the neck and killed, while the
consignment of fruit will he blotted out from the
universe. The N.S.W. fruit-growers are up in
arms at this series of insults to the State worm,
and declare that the worm will turn. They have
asked Perry, M.L.A., to talk seriously to Maori-
land on the subject, and to tell it that Sydney
won’t take up any more of its loans if it goes on
like this.

A rabbit paragraph from Kingston (S.A.):
On Sunday last the service in the Church of England
had to be curtailed in the morning and abandoned in the
evening owing to the stencil from dead rabbits under the
flooring. Some few years ago it was owing chiefly to
rabbits burrowing under the Presbyterian Church that in
a gale this pretty and strong-looking edifice was partially
blown down, and has never been re-erected.
The rabbit comes into the town now and eats the
church and the church service. When the church
falls down, the congregation is so dispirited
through the rabbit that it doesn’t attempt to re-
build ; the rabbit would only eat the sacred edifice
again. Presently the rabbit will eat our religion.
Meanwhile we try to get level by eating the
rabbit, and if there were 20,000,000 of us instead
of 4,000,000 (which there probably would he hut
for the importer and the huge landlord and the
rabbit) we might eat the rabbit faster than the
rabbit eats us. For the present, however, the
rabbit is a more successful eater than the human.
“ Polstan ” : The frill-necked lizard neither
uses its Elizabethan decoration as an external
vice in which to hold grasshoppers (as recently
stated in Bulletin) nor as a savings-bank, as
averred by “ Ooloo.” The frill is used as a re-
ceptacle merely in which to store rations for
future use. Dissected one of these lizards recently
and found the distended frill to be crammed with
insects held over from last gorge. Why the lizard
waves its collar around the landscape when dis-
turbed I cannot say, unless it is to show the assail-
ant where he will be put if he insists in his perse-
cution. The folds are only there for the convenient
stowing away of the apparatus when not in use.

“Jimmie Pannikin” : I shot my first fox
the other day, on the banks of the Muddybidgee.
My feat met with the approval of the wool-grower
on whose property
I was shooting. In
England such a
deed would have
been regarded with
horror. Reynard has
a curious palate.
Lately, down
Queanbeyan way,
foxes have been
feeding on the fish
that died mysteri-
ously. On the hats
along the ’Bidgeeat
Barren Jack, the
foxes hide turkey
and hen eggs in the
soil at the foot of
the cornstalks. Oc-
casionally they
plant the eggs in a
potato patch. A
few days ago a
farmer dug up nine
eggs that had been
buried by foxes for
future reference.
The eggs were per-
fectly fresh. Local
folk say that the
eggs remain good
for a very long
period when buried
deep in the culti-
vated soil. A fox is
a holy terror when
he gets among poul-
try. He revels in
wanton slaughter.
A record kill near
Sterile John was 23
fine, fat turkeys
that were being
saved for Christinas
selling. At Unarm, near the mighty (Jotter
Creek, the geese sleep at night out in the middle
of the water-holes and darns. It is probably
only a matter of a short time till the fox takes
to nocturnal swimming.

“ Albert D.” : Even the nigger brand of
female has her hysterical moments. Was at
Gampolo (Central Ceylon) in March last, when a
Tamil coolie was being tried for a criminal offence
upon a Mahommedan girl of 13 summers. The
girl swore that the Tamil had waylaid her in the
jungle reserves of a big tea plantation. The case
was heard by a jury of white estate overseers.
The girl’s testimony was unsupported, while the
eoolie had the evidence of his white boss and
several others to prove that he was 16 miles away
at the time of the alleged offence. There was an
acquittal, of course, and the coolie and girl were
returned to their different estates. Following
day I was invited to attend a nigger walloping
scene, conducted by a kanyani, or headman, m
the presence of 700 Tamil tea-pluekers, children
and women. The imaginative girl was brought
forward, naked to the waist, and the kanyani
flogged the devil out of her with a thin bamboo
cane. As a streak of poetic justice it ranged from
middling to horrible. But even the free-and-easy
Tamil has no time for imaginative females, and
he deals promptly with the she-liar who yearns

THE COWMAN’S BRIDE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In one instance a girl in one of the dairying districts,
who was married in the morning, left the church and
entered immediately on her daily work on her husbands
farm. Sydney Telegraph.
In the Ballantina Valley,
Where the cow’s a queen supreme,
And religion is the tally
Of the co. that buys the cream ;
Where the butter-fat percentage
Is the topic of the day,
Every youth of diffident age
Nerves himself the word to say.
Since fair Angelina married,
Cynicism’s disappeared ;
At no wedding breakfast tarried
She when scrub was to be cleared.
For her husband made things willing ;
And as soft she sighed, “ I will,”
He drove off to start her filling
All the pig troughs up with swill.
There’s no time for anybody
On a dairy farm to spoon ;
So he set her on to poddy
Calves that summer afternoon,
While he did a bit of fencing
And informed his loving spouse
It was time she was commencing
If she meant to bail the cows.
So the rosy joys of heaven
In the honeymoon she drinks,
As she milks her forty-seven
And the sun in splendor sinks ;
While the bridegroom’s eyes awaken
With love-light, as he says “ Gosh 1
What a bloomin’ time you’ve taken !
Now jest give them tins a wash.”
So she spent the ev’ningscrubbing
Tins beside the buggy shed ;
And when she had finished rubbing,
Angelina went to bed ;
While young Edwin chased a curly
Sow across the countryside,
And returned for breakfast early
With his bonnie blushing bride. •
So the fertile Ballantina
Swells with sweet erotic sighs ;
Now they see how Angelina
Makes her husband’s profits rise ;
For it little costs to keep her,
And the wisest cockies say
That a wife is mighty cheaper
Than a girl you have to pay.

THE CHARMER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
According to a young woman’s admission in a Melbourne
Court, because a male acquaintance refused to see her
when she went to call at his office, she tried to bring him
out by throwing stones on his roof.
Ah, when your dear is chary, and you fail to lure him out
For a Saturday at Brighton, where the coastal breezes
shout
In the ti-tree on the cliff-top, whence the outlook is
sublime,
You can break his resolution ; you can fetch him every
time,
If you fill your peggy-bag
With a mass of broken flag ;
If you rattle bricks on him you love,
You’ll hear love’s language up above,
And, in his old, kind, courtly way, he’ll offer you good oof
To go away and stop your play of ballast on his roof.
When he treats you with aversion and a very distant air ;
When you get the frozen shoulder from the one you want
to snare ;
When to all your warm endearments he will answer
“ H’m ” no more,
You must take along a bag of rocks and start a local war.
He’ll soon be at your feet
Imploring “ Stop it, sweet ! ”
You’ll have him backed against the wall
When loud your high-flung boulders fall
From out the palpitating blue ! This is the latest proof
Of love—anew-style billet-doux—the brickbat on the roof!
vie.

“David H. Richards”: T’other day,
whilst pursuing romance through sylvan glades, I
encountered a large green frog bogged in a conun-
drum of no mean size, and arrayed in an ex-
pression reminiscent of Bob Philp after the
elections. He (the frog— not Bob Philp) had
undertaken to surround a tarantula, and when
about half-way across his contract had suddenly
hit the fact that he had chewed more than he could
bite off, or something. He couldn’t get the taran-
tula up or down, Profane curse language shone
in his eye ; but though the spirit was willing
enough the flesh was weak, and he was unable to
utter his opinions on account of the edible in his
mouth. At first I was tempted to relieve him,
but the still small voice of zoology whispered that
here science might be served, and I bided awhile,
and the frog did athletics, and pervaded the
scenery in vain endeavors to part company with
his dinner. At length, when he was about to
yield up the spectre, I seized the tarantula bv the
hind-quarters and yanked him back to freedom.
When I dropped him on the sphere he fled with
celerity, and expedition, and other goods and
effects, while the frog fairly incarnadined the
ether with eloquence about the whole race of
tarantulas. Then I went on after Romance, whom
I espied dawdling amongst the trees further on.

OLD INHABITANT : “ Did thee hear ’bout Jimmy
Polglaise ’ avin ’ he sack?"
THE MINER : “ Iss! The great chuckle-head
went down to meetin' last night and prayed
in Cap’a Billy Treloggan's turn.”
An old-time Bulletin controversy as to
whether snakes slime their prey is recalled by a
recently published yarn from Bombala (N.S.W.)
about a two-year old kiddy who returned to the
bouse partially slimed, and gave a vague des-
cription of the thing that had taken his bread and
butter.
ASSAULT AND BATTERY.
INTOXICATED PERSON (after colliding heavily with the lamp-post): "Now, wha’ the (hie)
doose did I shay to that fellow!”
“ Agricola Be “ Oxo ” (B. 12/3/’08).
There is not much chance of the imported deer
becoming a thistle within the meaning of the Act,
or any other noxious weed. It is too large and
shootable. Likewise, it does not breed with the
swiftness of the rabbit. A few years ago deer
were quite plentiful on the Blue Cornstalk Moun-
tains, overlooking the Nepean. Shooters from
Penrith and thereabouts used to spend a consider-
able amount of time in stalking them, and many a
house boasts an antlered head on the wall. How-
ever, they are now so scarce that it is only by
accident that one is found. These deer were origi-
nally kept sacred by Cox, of Mulgoa. But no fence
could be devised to hold them, and they escaped
to roam among the gullies. For several years a
white buck was among them, and shooters camped
out for a week at a time in the hope of scoring off
him. However, as no mention of his assassination
was ever made in the local papers, I presume that
he became the Oldest Inhabitant, and at last died
in his bed of senile decay.

“ Vigilans ” : In the way of coaching ex-
perience, Peckham, of the Northern Territory,
ought to rank with the best. He runs the
mail from the Katherine River into
civilisation, and covers 900 miles every
six weeks. In his 15 years or over he
has frequently had to negotiate a 90-
mile dry stage. But, like most of
these old-timers in the “ inside ” of
the Territory, he is a big, hard man,
and never sick or sorry. The Katherine,
which Beckham’s mail serves, is one of
the large rivers of the Territory,
taking its source in high, bold table-
lands, 40 or 50 miles east of the tele-
graph station. The country about its
banks seems admirably adapted for
fruit-growing, while tobacco, maize,
and fibrous plants should also thrive.
At present there are only a few cattle
and horses on the river, and they are
doing well. It is a never-failing stream,
a tributary of the Daly, which is navi-
gable for 100 miles ; in times of flood it
is merely a question of steam power
to make it navigable right up to the
telegraph station. It is well lined
with useful timber, paper bark, and
cypress pine predominating. It has
been proved that the grasses, when
eaten down, rapidly improve. Springs
occur along the river banks, throwing
large volumes of water. A public-house
and store, telegraph station, and police
station, are, so far, the only habita-
tions. The cypress pine is the most
useful timber in the Territory, being
one of the few that are proof against white ants.
Cultivation of the cypress should be |one of the
future industries of the North.

Big Scrub (N.S.W.) dairydom has given
up talking Cow for a while to talk Bull. At the
1907 Bangalow show a dairy person exhibited his
bull in a pure-bred class, but the judge ordered
Taurus out of the ring, saying that he wasn’t
pure-bred. This year the animal was entered in
a grade class, but was promptly fired out of the
ring on the ground that he was a pure-bred.
Hence the substitution of Bull talk for Cow talk
up that way. Meanwhile the owner of the cow’s
brother is wondering what sort of animal he’s got
hold of ; but on the question of what sort of
animal the average show judge is, he has no
doubts whatsoever.
THE DROVERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
What may be considered a record droving performance
has been accomplished with a mob of 1700 bullocks
brought from Victoria Downs station, in the Northern
Terntory to Narrabn, an approximate distance of 3000
miles. The animals have just arrived here after beirn- is
months on the road.— Daily paper. ' °
Half of the year has come and gone
Since the day we left the Downs,
And still we’re riding on and on
Through the out-back camps and towns.
Hill and valley and upland pass,
Mountain, river, and plain,
Riding on through the girth-deep grass,
Riding on in the rain.
Spring and Summer and Autumn go
In the countless nights and days,
And still we travel sure and slow
By the drovers’ lonely ways.
Six months nearer the auctioneer,
And the trip has but begun
Lord ! but it’s mighty dry out here,
Riding on in the sun !
Dust goes up in a choking haze
And hangs in the heated air,
And Crack ! Crack ! Crack ! the stockwhip says :
To the straying beast, “ Back there ! ”
So, straight on, till the sun g’oes down
And the bush stands still and stark,
To where the lights of some small town
Gleam and wink in the dark.
Cities call to the Bush—and straight
The beasts of the Bush go by,
The poor brutes seem to guess their fate,
They are restless where they lie.
The waning moon makes all things gray,
And the night is almost gone ;
Now, while the world awaits the day,
We must be moving on.
Spring and Summer and Autumn go
In the lonely days and nights,
And still we travel sure and slow
In all of the changing lights
Hill and gully and bleak hillside,
Mountain and valley and bend.
Riding out where the world is wide
Riding on to the end.

Frank H.: The thing is a glaring swindle.
Besides, your letter would never reach the people.
They are on the prohibited list, and correspondence
addressed to them is arrested by the postal authorities.
....H. : You misunderstand altogether, and so drop
into a most libellous statement. The girl won her case,
and, therefore, got an order for Costs. So “ the other
side ” had to pay her solicitor his taxed Costs. Then she
had to pay him his Costs as “between solicitor and
client ” —for the work in connection with the case which
he couldn’t charge to the other side. It was all strictly
legal and honorable, and in accordance with the best
traditions of Costs Coalopolis :So many places have
been called Devil-something (including the Dirty Devil
River, the Devil Drum Lake, the Devil’s Thumb, and the
Devil’s Mother) for no visible reason, that it is waste of
space to ask how your river came by its name. Probably
the discoverer found it too high to be crossed, and as
he dashed down his swag said angrily that it was a devil
of a river Southern Cross: A discussion as to how
long a horse can buck would be profitless. No two
horsey men agree as to what is a buck. The cattle man
from Central Q., where they rope their outlaws and mount
them on the ground, denies that the show savage is a real
bucker ; Waite would scoff at the pig-rooting steed that
is denounced as a “ bucker ” in the English hunting field,
and so on down the scale. The concensus of expert
opinion appears to be that really enthusiastic equine
protest never lasts in its extreme form more than half-a-
minute or 50.... Alf: Story of serving-maid who
was addicted to illegitimate infants hopelessly un-
suited to this paper, wicked though it may be on
some points Gerald B. : “Woodland Garden”
has grace, but the metre has faults, and-
the ideas are somewhat incongruous J.B.M. :
That “ Who-keeps-the-pub-there-now ” joke is as old
as the bunyip’s uncle. Vainly have you tried to
make it bright and fresh by shifting the site from Sydney
to Melbourne... .Snowy: Jokes re weighing-machine and
Epsom salts thin and unsavory.... Wheeze : Reminis-
cences interesting, but too unrelievedly drunken. In
literature dulness begins where alcoholic references re-
fuse to end.. ..Ge Logos : Mysterious address-less screed
headed “ Speed of Kangeroo ” to hand, accompanied by a
Vic. Id. stamp. What does it all mean ? Tyrex: You
ask in faint blue pencillings whether it is advisable for
contributors to write on one side of the paper only. The
answer is “ Yes.” Also, it is advisable that they should
use ink, that they should supply a fair number of
punctuation marks for each square inch of copy,
and that they should shun foolish questions that
have been answered many a time before
Postfunera: You have a muddled, inarticulate pen
wherefore your exact grievance is hard to locate. None
of these ills can be exorcised by writing about them....
Virgo : More spirit than skill. You can’t rhyme “ strain ”
with “ claim,” for instance Tapui: Judging from the
part sent we think the whole complete screed would have
found its natural home in the basket Max: “The
Hat ” is the better of the two, but contains much that
might have been left out with advantage Caesar : Too
slight of interest, but fairly well-written, and promises
better work in future.. ..Romanist: Local interest only.
Bosker : Thanks for your good opinion, but we don’t
print eulogies of ourselves D.M.M. : Can’t see any-
thing in it... .C.E.D. : One of them has glimmers of
merit, but is otherwise nonsensical. What, for instance
is “a damned soul’s core”? The Rover: You label
them “ poems,” and, almost as a matter of course, they
are rubbish.... Donald : You haven’t improved on the
1 i^ a »» ’ *^ yourself, “ that story’s very
old ” and you don’t put any new face on it Tired
Teddy : You made us very tired G.M.O. : The point
might have been made much sharper Marion M’C :
Haidly well enough handled.... N. A. P. : Required more
spirited and vigorous treatment C: We could do
nothing with that Sydneyite: Not remarkable one
way or the other Patriot: You may be, but
you re a very poor poet! Highwayman: Might
have been a lot worse Rebee: It was the
bus you just missed, not the rubbish cart
Cocoanut Whiskers : Unpleasant joke re habits of famiiv
cat unprintable The Stranger: Your literary stvle
makes good in the matter of raciness, but it’s too techni-
cal. Take this, for instance “ A stranger mooched up
to the station. He was dressed in a slouch hat and
spanking new flannel shirt. His colored moles (sixes-
fourB) were a trifle too wide for him, and he
had an enormous pair of Roman-Protestants 0n,”....
Itmily J. H. : Does not display any literary gift; though,
as you are obviously inexperienced, that verdict need not
be final... .The Boy : Too discursive and long-winded....
Stilton M. : You are right—it is a bit too “ rocky.”.."
r J.H.: Some of it is absolute nonsense P.O.T. : Mis-
placed ingenuity. ..Juan: Only moderate merit, and
viz b ~u k verse ” >8 merely chopped-up prose
ar' i : rhanks »c interesting, but belated.. Oh La :
A little crude in the handling, but not very far short
?! the , ,nark Crutch: It isn’t a triolet
Onward : You don’t say what was the nature of the com-
petition, and, anyhow, the verses are not English
Eugene Just: Not badly done, but the incident wasn’t
worth the trouble... .Novelist: In answer to your ques-
tions : (1) Nowhere on the civilised globe can “ a person
inclined for writing obtain by correspondence, for a
nominal fee, a few useful lessons on the art of short-story
writing or novel writing.” (2) You cannot “ learn the
art out of a book. It is a natural gift, like lying, or run-
ing a Deform League, and cannot be acquired by tuition...
Lirkus: Language too obscure....Renzo : Confused,
ridiculous, and lengthy communication to hand. Being
a‘m lffl ? ie " Cl y stal “P ed it; cost us 2d R. Nolan: It is
difficult to tell when the last vestiges of life leave a maga-
zine. Cain has been dead quite a while, and still there
are peop le going about raising Cain. So, though the
publication you mention has apparently not appeared
since October last, it is impossible to state that it won’t
rise again... .Dram : “ The Red Page ”is not run in the
interest of opticians, and there is no sentimental attach-
ment to the name of the page. But the space allotted to,
and the distribution of, reading matter is decided by a
higher power than Literature ; and the Pink Page, after
trying to turn white in a single night, has given up the
struggle Coma : Excellent material, not well enough
handled L.A.R. : Ranges from very good to pretty
bad....C. Wheeler: Smart, but rather trifling... .Hwac :
Candid, but commonplace.... Ikaroa : You don’t get any-
thing fresh into it.... Euroka : Rather clumsy and in-
effective Alf K. : Has just a glimmer of merit.
....Swift: It isn’t swift; it’s desperately slow
K.L.M. : Sound sense, but weak versification
D.C. (M.L.): Beer joke re place where living is inexpen-
sive, since “a man can get it for 4d. a pint there just as
elsewhere,” is flat and sour with age. Beer jokes don’t
keep in this climate Tho.P.: Yours is a quaint story—
a sort of mystery yarn apparently. What chiefly baffles
us is why the auctioneer who “ heard Rev. Law’s deeply
impressive discourse ” went and “ roused Rev. Scott out
of his vicarage,” and clamored for the church key. Eor
what reason, again, did he approach Rev. Scott in the
street and wrestle in argument with him ? Law started
the trouble ; wherefore worry Scott? Even admitting
that the auctioneer is “ a great horse-man, and went to
races on St. Patrick’s Day,” his conduct remains inex-
plicable J.M,: One verse of “The Wild Schoolboy”
suffices:—
There was nothing about him sneaking or mean ;
His true character could very easily be seen :
In manner offhanded,
His nature was candid,
His heart warm and true,
In fact he was what we might term—the true blue.
After that it was surely a work of supererogation to point
out that he—
Now fills a post of honor and trust.
J. Beaton : N 0... .L.J.V. : Some of it is very good, and
some is obviously padding Thorold H. :No ; you are
not wasting your time. “ Remorse ”is very nearly good
enough. The other is too conventional.... Gerald B. :
We don’t altogether care for it, but it certainly shows a
great improvement in style,.. .W.R.P.: Too vague and
implicative....R. A.H. : One or two good points didn’t
save it... W.H.R.: Somewhat cheap and obvious
Laval: High as a British game course was your
little tale. It has been buried deep F.S. : Accept
your assurance that the story, entitled “How’s your
mother?” is a fact; but the point of it eludes us. A
“ well-dressed woman ”is seen sitting on a kerbstone. A
drapery assistant, pointing at her, says “ Good gracious !
That’s my mother! ” Later, the lady rises from the
kerbstone and goes away in a cab observing “ I’m
saved ! I’m saved ! ” In regard to all of which this paper
demands dully “ why not ?” Tas. B. M.: You are an
adroit liar; but your efforts are somewhat lacking in
body. Persevere, however H. J. O’N : Don’t consort
much with bishops ; yet instinctively know that your
picture of the one in “ The Parson at Bay” is untrue to
life. For example :
The Bishop arrived with an angry frown
And warned the folk of Alexandra town ;
Said he, “ I brought a chap with me
To teach you wisdom and set you free.
The other chap I gave the sack
For allowing you blokes to get off the track,” etc.
No bishop uses grammar like that J. Stevenson: No,
David Syme had no interest whatsoever in that paper. .
J.G.L.: It would have been better in prose than in bad
verse, and, anyhow, you don’t make your point clear
enough Wombat: It’s a shade risky. F.J.H. : Hasa
good touch here and there, but doesn’t “arrive” as a
wh01e.... Kelpie : “ What is a ‘ hard case’?” Well, when
the term doesn’t mean a sharper it means a man too
worldly-wise to be surprised at anything Mechanic :
We have no information whatever on the subject
G.W.K. : Not quite good enough Pompey : Too far-
fetched and flighty. Humorist: That’s just what you are
not! Null: Amusing. Pity the dog and dynamite
gag is so ancient.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
Ginghi: No good whatsoever... J.E.N. : Neither of
much account. Your swagmen are inhuman monstrosi-
ties D. Darcy : Pen-and-ink sketch of girl’s head is very
good indeed. Unfortunately, the girl’s head isn’t a very
saleable branch of art so far as newspapers are concerned.
Even the whole girl isn’t very saleable.... Caro : Not good
enough. Also you shouldn’t borrow another contribu-
tor’s pen name. “ Caro ” of The Bulletin is an occasional
writer of good tales and verse, and she doesn’t deserve to
have her name hitched to your bad picture. ...Harold A. :
Too local in its interest Swan : The man who suffers
from inward drought has been pictured so often that he
needs to be something unusual to pass muster....A.N.:
“ 3 p.m.” fails rather badly.

Judge Eagleson (Vic.) refused to hear a
Warrnambool lawyer who appeared in court, the
other day, minus his wig. ]f Thk Bulletin were
asked for a definition of a Judge it might be
tempted to say : “A man who sometimes wears
the hair of a horse with the air of an ass.”
One Barnes, of Sydney, writes heatedly to
Tom Bent, objecting to that gentleman’s reference
to his immortal soul. “Immortality has to be
won by grace,” says Barnes, “ and its attainment
is conditional.” Evidently he does not think
Tommy is fulfilling the conditions. But we have
the assurance of many high-priced theologians
that the damned are immortal, and possibly
Bent’s references are intended to be taken from
that point of view.
Kavanagh, the Westralian detective who
convulsed the Groper State last year with his
gold-stealing revelations, died in Sydney last
week. He had undergone an operation in Berth,
but came to Sydney for further advice, and passed
out two days after arrival. At the time when the
Koval Commission was considering the alleged,
gold-stealing, Kavanagh, for one crowded hour,
was a bigger public figure in W.A. than John
Forrest.
Lipson Hancock, who has been rushed off
to America and- Europe to see if he can find out
how the old Wallaroo and Moonta copper mines
can go on working at a profit, had the rare Aus-
tralian experience of being born on the mines that
he now general-manages ; and, except while he
was studying, he has scarcely been off those mines
since. His father was general manager for 34
years before him. The Almighty and Cap’n Han-
cock are mixed up in hopeless confusion in scores
of Moonta minds; the confusion is all the worse
because Cap’n Hancock knocks off the work of
bossing the big mines on Sunday to boss the local
Methodist Sunday-school.
Admiral Evans, of the U.S., now bound
this way, is, by all accounts, an interesting per-
sonality. but hardly so unconventional as his
countryman, Captain McNeill, with whom he is
compared.. McNeill, while cruising off the Dago
coast of Sicily, was visited by a friendly and well-
meaning baud, which did its best to play Ameri-
can tunes, but the captain hoisted his anchor in
the midst of the performance and carried the
astonished musicians to the U.S. On another occa-
sion, when about to leave a French harbor, he
found himself three officers short. Three French
officers happened to be dining on board that even-
ing, so he carried them with him, as he remarked, '
“to complete the complement.” Admiral Bob
Evans, however, is about as unconventional as a
naval officer can afford to be these times.
THE TRUE FRIEND.
LONDON, Sunday Afternoon.—When the visit of the
United States battleship fleet to Australia was announced,
an official of the Foreign Office, at Tokio, stated that the
decision to send the fleet on a tour of the world would
silence all talk of war, and be a guarantee of peace.
JACKO: “ Get along with pour cricket , sonny; I
won’t 'urt per while your Uncle Samuel’s

A story is told about a Gippsland adven-
ture that happened to Excellency Hopetoun
during one of his bush excursions. He had
dropped in at a wayside inn for refreshment
during a hot ride, and returning to his tethered
neddy found it surrounded by a bunch of bucolics,
who believed that the animal was a well-known
local show horse that had been stolen a year or so
earlier. Each man was prepared to swear to the
horse, and the Governor was not permitted to
depart till he had furnished his name and address.
He gave his name as ‘‘Adrian Hope,” his address
as “Government House, Melbourne.” The
address impressed the bush push. It took a more
subdued tone. “Praps you’re stayin’ with the
Gov’ner, Mister ? ” said the most aggressive spirit.
“ 1 am,” replied his Ex. “ Well,” said the man,
dubiously, and still looking at the neddy, “all I
can say is that ’Opetoun ought to get a hint to
keep an eye on his ’orses, or some o’ them might
get lost.” 6
“Melb” writes:—
The Southern Cross this week has a letter which gives
me a rather nasty taste in the mouth. It is from Charles
Alexander, the evangelistic singing comedian. He reports
that he is unable to arrange terms with Dr. Torrey for
another trip to Australia, but hopes to bring instead a
really good man in one Wilbur Chapman. These people
talk like strolling actors about arranging terms. The
situation looks as if either Torrey or Alexander said,
“You know, I’m a bigger man than you in pulling the
people, and must have a bigger percentage.” I rather
fancy Alick, the Holy Humorist, will be the man-with the
swelled head, since he achieved the loftiest goal of a
travelling evangelist—he annexed a rich wife.
Rev. George Gladstone, the recalcitrant
rector of Nathalia (Vic.), claims that Bishop
Armstrong has got him “set” because he (George)
refuses to call him (the Bishop) “My Lord.”
Bishop Armstrong insists that the title is his
right; but he has neither right nor title. In
Australia there are no Lord Bishops. In any case,
there is a streak of irreverence about the title
which might make any respectable sin-shifter
avoid it. What, after all, is the exact difference
between alluding to his Gaiters of Wangaratta as
“Mv Lord” and calling him straight out “My
God ” ?
One pressman sums up another :
The Argus, with pardonable vanity, tries to represeht
the late Howard Willoughby as the best journalist evolved
by Australia. I could not place him even in the first
dozen or two dozen of a galaxy which has included
Archibald and Syme. “ Journalist ”is a very large word.
Willoughby is challenged by Gullett and Julian Thomas.
Nor does he efface a Winter, in constructive journalistn.
The quicksilver readiness in which he excelled is a riot
uncommon thine. His strongest point was his knowledge
of Victorian politics. Yet such a knowledge becorhes a
hamper. Willoughby had a grand library of useless infor-
mation in the pigeon-holes of his mind. This is how it is
with a daily newspaper man who sticks to one place.
Willoughby began on the Age in 1861, and transferred
to the Argus in 1862, the enviable leap of that
era. The Age had half the Argus Staff, half the
pay, and half the experience. Yet there was Davy
with the measuring tape every day, insisting, too,
on an equality of intrinsic excellence and knowledge.
Willoughb3'’s calibre was soon proved on the Argus, as
Maoriland war correspondent, and Westralian corres-
pondent re transportation. In 1866, three Argus
reporters, Robinson, Hadley, and Willoughby, went off to
form the Hansard staff, at £lO a week, which was mighty
pay those times. Willoughby was a painfully artistic
slow shorthand-writer—that is to say, he made the most
leisurely' hieroglyphics in taking verbatim the most rapid
speeches. Walter Cooper, reporter and dramatist, was of
the same school. In 1869, Willoughby became editor,
and one-third proprietor, of the Daily Telegraph. Left
this to become Argus news-editor. It is a surprise to
find him so 01d—69. He was lucky to have lasted so
long, with his frail appearance. He was built on gentle
feminine lines, and must have had the feminine kind of
strength. His two accomplished sisters respectively
married D. D. Wheeler and Alick Britton. Willoughby
did not get his proper chance. He ought to have been
editor for, at all events, the second third of Haddon’s
term, and then should have retired in favor of
Cunningham.
“ Cassiterite,” about a lately-retired min-
ing man :
H. W. F. Kayser, for a generation general manager of
Tasmania’s grand tin mine, Mount Bischoff, was born at
the German mining town of Clausthal, where there is one
of the world’s most renowned mining academies. On the
principle that a man born in a stable must be a horse,
Kayser was from the first looked upon in Australia as a
mining authority. When “Philosopher” Smith, the
discoverer of Mount Bischoff (Smith, despite
what has been written and said to the contrary,
didn’t know' that he had struck tin when he found the
mountain of it), was looking for some one in Victoria to
work the show, Kayser was recommended to him by the
late Prof. Ulrich. Ulrich was also a Clausthal man ; so
Kayser, who had reached Victoria during the digging days,
was given a leg up. He wasn’t a big mining man ; but,
then, nobody suspected that Mt. Bischoff was a big mine.
Just prior to leaving Victoria, Kayser married a Miss
Druce, cousin of G. H. Druce, who subsequently was
plaintiff in the Portland Dukedom case. Kayser, at one
time, was very proud of this relationship. After getting
to the mine Kayser secured the services of James Quinton,
a clever engineer, and an honest fellow. They sent to
Germany for books and drawings of the tin-dressing
machinery in use in the Fatherland, and adopted and
modified it. The mine steadily made Kayser a rich man
(he was getting nearly £2500 a year at one time). His
deeds on the Bench are still retailed when yarns are going.
He also tried his hand at reporting upon other properties,
but was rather unfortunate. The Briseis float brought
him the consulting engineer’s fat billet, for he w'as
Kayser of the “ Big Mt. Bischoff.” But the glory did not
last long. Now Kayser u-ants to sell his Tasmanian
properties. He has very few friends, and feels lonety.
There is a weird and wonderful recluse
loose up at Tahiti, and without a keeper. He
calls himself “The Nature Man,” but his
real name is E. VV. Darling, and he was for
two years a student at the Leland-
Stanford University, California. He lives
entirely on fruit and vegetables, and his
only garment is a loin cloth. His home
is high up on a mountain, and he bathes
about twenty times daily. Being some-
thing of a second Moses he has manu-
factured a fearful set of commandments,
ten in number. Here followeth a slab from
same, verbatim :

J. J. Power, great panjandrum of N.S.W.
Licensed Victuallers’ brigade, once had the rare
experience of being defeated in a contest for a
seat in the City Council through the excessive
enthusiasm of a number of his admirers. He was
standing for the Lang Division of Sydney, and
was beaten by two votes. A subsequent investi-
gation showed that 26 votes intended for him had
been rejected as informal because the voters had
emphasised their admiration by writing on the
papers: “A jolly good fellow,” “Won’t go
home until morning,” “ Tooral looral,” “Right
O,” “Good iron,” and other bursts of maniacal
affection.

George Turner says that he is done with
politics, and that he quitted just in time. the
very morning he left office he was so unnerved
and run down he could not even sign formal
papers put before him. Even to-day, if he looks
into a financial question, it means two or three
sleepless nights.” So he eschews politics alto-
gether. And he says he is better off, financially
as well as physically.
The late Archibald Forsyth, of Sydney,
was a stern Protectionist in politics, but a most
disturbing influence in the newspaper
discussion of that policy. He promoted
Protectionist newspaper ventures, held
interests in Sydney Globe and Star
and other organs, and attentively read
their leading articles. And Archie, being
a Scot, always wanted to show that the
article was “susceptible of another
meaning.” He would do this before the
board of directors, for he was sometimes
a director, or climb the stairs and per-
form the feat to the editor, or he would
encounter the writer of the article out
of doors and explain how cruelly Protec-
tion was injured by the publication of
such “opeenions.” In his time (he
lived to be 82) he may be said to have
proved to his own satisfaction that the
arguments of nearly all local Protec.
tionist writers supported the doctrine of
Freetrade. Some writers backed out
of writing on Protection, afraid of
Archie’s inevitable letter of a column
and a half. Towards his latter end,
however, he developed an edge on our
Freetrade papers, and regularly sent a
long letter to the Herald or Tele-
graph to prove that such or such an
article on Freetrade was “susceptible
of a Protectionist meaning.” In the
main, Archibald Forsyth’s Protection
meant Protection for employers only;
the workers, according to him, had their
share out of the extension of their field
of labor.
Alas ! alas ! for the fallen mighty !

geant-Major Darley was chief at Carter’s Barracks,
situated alongside the old cemetery and Benevo-
lent Asylum. He was appointed drill sergeant at
the depdt till 18(10, when he went on bush duty
hunting snakes and outlaws. In 1863 he earned
promotion 'to a sub-inspectorship in his hand-to-
hand encounter with John Frederick Lowry, pro-
fessional bushranger, at the Limerick Races
public-house at Cork Yale Creek. Lowry was
mortally wounded, and Stephenson had a bullet
wound in the hand and two bullet holes in his
tunic. It was one of the early cases of “ tarin’

A horrid tale from Bendigo :
Here is another incident, hitherto unrecorded, in eon-
nection with a prominent stout politician’s visit to Ben-
digo (Vic.). At the farewell to Mrs. Lansell, widow of
the late Golden King, the big man of Parliament was
suddenly struck with the idea that a hunch of flowers
was the very missile for the occasion. So he
waddled across to the refreshment table and snatched a
bouquet, dripping wet, from one of the vases, and was in
the act of throwing the departing- guest’s wicket down,
or, in other words, destroying her silk dress with it, when
the lady withered him with a look and gathered up her
skirts in time to save the situation. The fat man de-
sisted, but turned round and threw the soaking mass of
bloom into the lap of a prominent citizeness who sat near
by. A lady in ruined clothes and a beaming politician
parted almost immediately afterwards.
John Atherton, who gave his name to the
unsurpassable timber country back o’ Cairns
(N.Q.) is still living-. He has his home at
Mareeba, on the Cairns-Atherton line, and is
comfortable enough. It was in the’seventies that
he dived into the rich belt with a mob of cattle
from Rockhampton. It was due to his observa-
tion, too, that Herberton tinfield was first
opened up. On his second visit he carried a pick
and shovel and a dish, and found tin. A syndi-
cate of five was formed, but Atherton withdrew
because of other unlucky mining specs. Jack and
Newell, well known in the North, were the prin-
cipals who plodded on, and they are still partners.
The Bulletin’s Oldest Inhabitant says:—
Apropos Hosie’s pie shop (B. 12/3/’08): It appears that
in trusting to memory as to an incident of over 40 years
ago. 1 did the old-time firm of Levy Brothers an injustice.
In mentioning the large business premises (occupied bv
the firm in the mid ’sixties in Bourke-street) as being
occupied by Hosie on his return from England, I said,
parenthetically that the firm had “gone bung.” A con-
tradiction having appeared, I made further inquiries, and
find that the big building was idle through Messrs. Levy
Brothers having given up the retail trade, and gone into
the wholesale in Little Collins-street, then into Lonsdale-
street, where, as Levy Brothers, Limited, they a edoingan
extensive trade. 1 don’t suppose the slip that a firm in
Bourke-street went bung 40 and odd years ago has depre-
ciated the shares of Levy Brothers, Limited—at least I
hope not.
Lhe postmaster at Melbourne in 1840 was
Mr. David Kelsh. At that time all letters posted
in Melbourne for Europe went via Sydney, the
postage being Is. Od. There were ships direct
to England, but the Sydney authorities paid
Kelsh commission on the takings, and the
extra charge involved by sending Melbourne
letters round to Sydney was good for Syd-
ney and also for David Kelsh. When op-
portunity offered some Victorians sent
their English letters to be posted in
Van Diemen’s Land, whence the postage
was 4d. Thus they saved Is. 2d., and made
the Sydney authorities angry, and made
David Kelsh little short of a raving maniac.
The self-complacency of Bruce Smith ex-
pands with the amusement or contempt it excites.
A Sydney man who marvelled at this Smith
characteristic, when Bruce was member of
N.S.W. Assembly, listened to him a few days ago
in the House of Reps., and declares the old
egotism to have swollen hugely. “Those who
only heard him in the N.S.W. Assembly have no
conception,’ says the visitor, “of what the
tremendous Smith is now as a platitudinous
burden and visitation.” The S. M. Herald is
coming to the same view of its one-time idol. It
thus described the Lord Smith in his last great
oration:—
The ghosts of the six hatters, the six potters, the
groom, the housemaid, and the tourist once more walked
the floor of the House, invoked by Mr. Bruce Smith. . . .
The House was almost empty. Half-a-dozen members sat
listlessly on the benches, and Mr. Deakin dozed at the
table while Mr. Bruce Smith spoke at length on the well-
worn topic.

Sydney Woman a Great Sufferer—Run Down
and Thin —Alarming Fits of Heart
Palpitation—Laid up for Weeks; Couldn’t
Bear the Sight of Food.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills Cured her when
Other Medicines Failed.
When the stomach’s out of order there’s sure
a.nd certain misery. Food doesn’t nourish. The
lightest meal causes pain and discomfort. Above
all, indigestion makes the outlook hopeless.
There’s a constant feeling of dread and impending
danger.
The rational cure for stomach disorders is the
tonic treatment. The stomach needs to be made
strong enough to do its work properly. There’s
strength for weak stomachs in Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills. When they are taken, every ounce of
food nourishes the system. Mrs. Michael Ryan,
Sydney, suffered with stomach disorders for
months. She didn’t have a day’s good health.
Doctors and other medicine did her no real good.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills cured her.
“ Some time back I got indigestion pretty badly,” said
Mrs. Michael Ryan, 55 Mill Street, Pyrmont. Sydney. “ My
appetite fell away to nothing. Every day I ate less—after
a mouthful of food I had a most dreadful gnawing pain
at the breast bone and between the shoulders. The food
wouldn’t go down but lay there like a heavy weight with
aburningpain. I’d feel as if I were smothering. There was
a nasty taste in my mouth and I was always bringing up
a bitter scalding fluid. At night I couldn’t sleep at ail
well. , I couldn’t walk quickly, for my heart would thump
and I’d think I was choking, and then as sure as fate I
would have a faint turn. I lost my color ;my skin turned
quite yellow. I had always been rather stout but with
the indigestion I lost a lot of flesh. The small of my back
ached terribly, and I could hardly stoop or bend. I was
ailing like this for months when a Mr. Tom Hewitt told
me to give Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills a trial. I did, and the
° ox ea Bed me a little. The pains in my chest lessened
and the heartburn began to wear off. The second box
did me more good than the first. My face got brighter
and rosier and the ringing noises in my ears ceased. The
third b° x set me fairly on my legs again, as the saying is.
I could get about without my heart beating as it used to.
By the time the last box of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills was
empty every bad symptom had gone. lam now in very
good health.”

After all, Kookaburra Peacock went back
on his declared intention to stick to the 54-hours-
a-week limit for employees of Victorian hotels,
etc., and compromised finally on 58 hours for
males and 56 for females. It was characteristic of
the Man with the Laugh. But as the new regula-
tion applies to all workers in hotels, coffee-palaces,
restaurants, etc.,_ including the boots and the
slushy, it is a distinct improvement on the former
slave-days, when 90 hours a week were quite
usual.
“Mr. Irvine strolls into the House at

The daily press makes a determined “ set ”
on Mauger as Postmaster-General. But, apart
from his desire to be ultra-good, and his indul-
gence in fermented and spirituous language,
Mauger is a good, sympathetic administrator, and
is more resolute than anybody else in the Parlia-
ment to put down sweating in the Post-office.
The row over the Federal postal admini-
stration practically boils down to this: The parish-
minded papers shouted for three years or so
“Federal Extravagance”—this despite the most
rigid economy on the part of the Australian
Government. Then, the “Extravagance” lie
being exploded a hundred times over, they
slewed round in a night and yelled “ Federal
Sweating ! ”
One result of the Sydney wharf troubles is
the diversion of the trade of the Clarence,
Richmond, and Tweed Rivers to Brisbane.
This trade has come to Sydney because it
comes from N.S.W. Geographically it belongs
to Brisbane, and since the trouble began it has
commenced to find its way there. And Sussex-
street fears that it may not come back.
The Times welcomes Deakin’s universal
military training scheme in Australia as “ giving
the Motherland a lead, which is badly wanted.”
Curious how the big British newspapers welcome
proposals which, according to our own benighted
“Australian” daily press—which is only Aus-
tralian in that it is published in Australia; other-
wise it is mostly pure Chow—are “ un-English,’
and utterly opposed to all the principles of the
blessed British Constitution.
N.S.W. ex-Premier Joseph Carruthers
goes to England on a vague “mission” as com-
missioner to a suburban exhibition, and to
nominally inquire about some small things which
the State pays the Agent-General to inquire
about. The State allows this rich man £l2OO for
expenses without Parliamentary authority. When
George Dibbs, who was a very poor man, spent
£lOOO on an equally intangible errand, the high
moral attitude of the Freetrade Tory papers was
so very high that there was snow on the top of it.
Have these papers any of that attitude left ?
Even after Wade’s proposed resumption
the Peel River Estate will cover close on 200,000
acres of N.S.W. territory. The price payable for
the present resumed portions amounts to a huge
dividend on the small expenditure of the original
A. A. Co., which created the Peel River Co. The
co. is getting off well, inasmuch as it is unloading
before genuine land and absentee taxes come
along. If N.S.W. had had a truly democratic
party in power, a graduated land and absentee
tax would have preceded resumptions ; in fact, a
graduated land-tax would in most cases have ren-
dered resumption unnecessary, as the owners
would have sold out in parcels long ago.
The council of Ballarat East has just fallen
in with a dull thud. Some 20 years ago it leased
to the Vic. Defence Department a slice of
ground granted in the long ago for market
purposes. The city had no market and didn’t
want the land, so it let the De-
fence people have the use
of it as a drill ground for
Is. a year. The other
day some mosquito-
souled State-righter
recollected that the
Defence Depart-
ment was now an
Australian insti-
tution, and urged
that jt should he
made to pay a solid
rent for the pad
dock. The depart-
ment was generous,
and offered £l5O a
year, which the council
accepted; but just here
Bent heard of the cir-
cumstance, and demanded
the £l5O for his next sur-
plus. Moreover, he col-
lared it. Wherefore, Ballarat
East is raving, and talks of
“taking steps” and “ven-
tilating the matter in Parlia-
ment. ’ It is a sad thing to see
one State insect fall on a smaller
insect, and snatch the poor little
trifle it has filched from the Com-
monwealth.
N.S.W. Premier Wade’s desire to destroy
the principle of industrial arbitration is, for-
tunately, not strong enough to resist the pressure
of rapidly-developing public opinion, and his new
Bill is gradually taking a shape which is at least
tolerable. By the time it gets through Committee
it may be a quite decent measure.
The endless, weary, flabby loquacity of the
Foreign-traders in the Senate is spreading the
tariff debate to such length tnat the question of
taking over the Northern Territory is postponed
till next session. It is a woeful disappointment.
There are so many things to be done, and the
Parliament is so bogged with interminable con-
versation that hardly anything is done.
Bruce Smith’s mild and patient friend
once more (Tweed Herald, northern N.S.W.): —
Owing to disgraceful scenes on the Bangalow show-
ground, caused by a number of Hindus making murderous
attacks on each other with sticksand stones, thecommittee
intends, so we are informed, to take steps to prevent
these undesirables from gaining admission to the grounds.
The course contemplated is to refuse them admission, and
to invite all other societies to adopt the same course. If the
Bangalow Society adopts this course, they will be re-
warded by the everlasting gratitude of the thousands of
people who, with their wives and children, patronise
shows. The conduct of these drunken savages right in
the midst of women and children, on the show-
ground, was most demoralising, while the blood-
thirsty and murderous assault made on one
of their number by three or four of them was
eribugh to upset the nerves of strong men, not to speak
of women and children. It is hoped the committee will
carry its intention into effect, and that ever}' other
society in the district will endorse their action. At last
Lismore Show these objectionable people created a dis-
turbance, and the time has arrived when steps should
be taken to absolutely exclude them, not only from
shows, but from every public gathering in the district.
Their presence on the streets is objectionable, but un-
fortunately it has to be endured.

Dear Bulletin. Be the Victorian Gold

pence, the wherewith to buy a loaf of bread. But
before a sale could be effected, he had to produce
a resident to identify him, and sign a declaration
on oath that he had come by the monstrous
nugget honestly. That is the sort of thing that
Bent allowed himself to be rushed into by Rev.

A handful of artillerymen, on the road to

to die. Teach a man to bear arms, cause
him to breathe the fighting atmosphere, and he will be
impatient to fight. We have a right to suggest that Vic-
toria contains a good many men of this class. N. f?..
Wales also might supply more than a few men of similar
morals. Queensland, we have reason to think, as in all
other Federal matters, would be very much out of the
business, as she could not supply men "of that sort for the
navy. It is only another injustice to Queensland.
N.S. W. Government has filled up the posi-
tion of Presidentof theSydnev Water and Sewerage
Board, vacated by Keele, whose criticisms of the
Works Department didn’t suit the Government,
by transferring W. J. Millner from Newcastle,
where he has been President of the Hunter Dis-
trict Water and Sewerage Board. Wade and Lee
evidently expect docility from Millner, but the
daily press are urging him not to be afraid—to be
contumacious if the public interest demands it.
And those same daily papers, when Keele was
victimised for honest service to the public, howled
like seven fiends when there was a proposal in
Parliament to give Keele his only practical
redress. Unless Millner is a man of independent
means, he will be wise to ignore the advice of the
daily papers, and to eat very humble pie indeed.
If he’s independent he’ll get sacked, and the daily
papers won’t help him.
“ T.S.” writes about little Kelly :
Little Kelly took some sudden leaping exercise in the
House of Reps, last week. Something was being said
about the appointment of a permanent Administrator of
Papua; and Kelly fled on to the soles of his boots to sug-
gest that “if it was not possible to get a man with
tropical experience in Australia the Government should
get one from abroad.” Considering the many hundreds
of capable men who have battled in tropicalAustralia—
magistrates, miscellaneous officials, squatters, surveyors
explorers, officers of police, and the like—the idea of it
being impossible to get a man with tropical ex-
perience in this country is childish. But it is iust
like Kelly. Kelly was born in Sydney—plain Aus-
tralian Sydnej r —but bis father made money and
bought Kelly an English accent with some ’of it
and a dreadful English pose took possession of Kelly and
he hardly knows now that it is possible to find anything
in Australia. In fact, Kelly seems hardly to know that
there is such a place as Australia. He vaguely suggests
the expensive prize hen that Bill Nye bought—the bird
that had become so inflated at having her portrait in the
American Egoist that she was quite unbearable and
fainted with horror when she came back from the show
because of the ordinary character of her American sur’
roundings. Australia has had enough of the experiment
of turning unknown imported persons loose on the Pos
session to run it on purely Johnny principles. Nobodv
but the Kelly kind of person would suggest a renewal 6f
that experiment.
Prime Minister Deakin is full of good
qualities, but his affable slackness makes even his
best friends use unpublishable language about him
at times. For instance, it is reported that “owing
to the unrest in Papua” he will take no steps for
some time to appoint a permanent Administrator.
One might think that the unrest is just the reason
why a strong man should be definitely appointed
right now; but Deakin, the procrastinator,
always finds it easier to put things off. There are
various men after the appointment, and the hope-
lessly Affable one hates to disappoint the unsuc-
cessful applicants. Also, any number of people
want to ad vise him on the subject, and it wouldn’t
be a perfectly and supremely Affable act to do any-
thing till they have all been heard. So there is
the usual, inevitable, shiftless hanging-up of the
subject.

“ Take me ! ” He beat the pewter on the bar.
“ Take me !” he cried. “ You would not think, a star,

“ Those were the times when politics were war.
“I’ve seen the members rolling on the floor,

“ And I was always at my country’s call!

FACILE PRINCEPS
A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, March 24, 1908.
My Dear Artnt,—
The late Duke of Devonshire was the male head
of the British “ smart-setters.” His elaborate air
of utter lassitude and weariness on every occasion
set a fashion which still lingers. Wherever
“ racin’ and gamblin’ ” on a big scale was in pro-
gress, there—stolid, placid, apathetic—was to be
observed the deceased and his astounding-looking
Duchess. He owned racehorses on a big scale
ever since he ceased to be Marquis of Hartington,
but his evil luck in this regard was a proverb of
sport. The Duchess, the first and keenest of the
Bridge enthusiasts inveighed against by
Father Vaughan, ran him close as a hope-
lessly unsuccessful racecourse and card-room
punter. This, combined with the twin
fact that he had many huge “seats” to keep up
in different parts of the United Kingdom, and
that Royaltv liked and visited him persistently
(a royal visit costs the host anything from £2OOO
to £10,000) rendered this particular nobleman one
of the world’s splendid paupers all his life.
Archdeacon Moxon (Anglican), of Grafton,
recently condemned from the pulpit the aged and
food-wastingpracticeof rice-throwing atmarriages,
and said “it was really a Hindu ceremony and
had neither reason, sentiment, nor religion to
recommend it. The old English custom of
strewing rose leaves before a bridal pair on the
path from the norch to the churchyard gate was a
beautiful one and might well supersede the other
objectionable custom.” He also pointed out that
“ quite a number of accidents had resulted from
rice-throwing,” which is a fact, for when half-a-
pound of rice gets into the bride’s eye she is liable
to spend the honeymoon in the and when
it gets into the horse’s eye that animal is liable to
leap prematurely and throw the bridegroom at
Old Harry.
Manager Tait, who met Mrs. Kubelik in
Frankfurt a while ago, and sat with her in a
musical box listening to Kubelik’s playing, des-
cribes her as fair-faced, fair-headed, dark-eyed,
and “ something like Grace Palotta, only more
airy, fairy-like.” My search through the half-ton
of Kubelik literature fails to reveal Kubelik’s
front name. His manager, Buckingham, will
have to give Kubelik a front name if he hasn’t
got one already. If not, we ll call him Billy.
But the half-ton of Billy Kubelik printed stuff
shows the names of his four small girls under
their portraits. They are Mary, Anna, Hanna
and Claire. If only the Taits caught K., and
brought him out with his wife and that infant
quartette, they would, after the Butt-Rumford
family experience, become known as “ The
Family Impressarios.”
“Alf Brasch ” sends this story of the meeting of
the Browning Society. I was in the midst of try-
ing to write an account of the meeting of the
.Josh Billings Society at Darling Point, but I
dropped the effort, and put this in instead
<• Now, girls, do let us get on with our work,” said the
chairwoman. “ At the last meeting, if you remember,
we were discussing that lovely passage :
Oh, the little more, and how much it is,
And the little less, and what Worlds away.
Isn’t it just too beautiful ? So true! So full of meaning'
You have something, you know, and something is added,
and it seems ever so much more —the last straw, in fact.
And then something is taken away, and it leaves less
than it was, only it seems so much more than it really is,
you know. ~ , , , ,
“I was only quoting it to poor Martha when her baby
was born ; and it was a girl, you know, and she wanted a
boy. Such a sweet child though, really, and so good.
Just reminds me of my little Beryl when she was that
age Yes, thank you, the dear child is quite all right
again. Of course, the heat tried her dreadfully, but I’m
sending her to Katoomba with nurse next week. • But,
about the poetry. It goes on somehow, you know :
How a sound can quicken content to bliss,
Or a word suspend the blood’s best play,
And life be a proof of this.
Isn’t it telling? Sublime I call it. One feels it constantly
in everyday life, , , , ,
“For instance, I was at the Ridgeway’s last week.
Bridge, of course. I sat there with three aces and a
king queen suit. It was my partner’s make, and I was
trembling lest he should make it spades, or clubs, or
something rotten like that. But when the man actually
said ‘No trumps’—well, I simply thought of that line
about a sound quickening content to bliss.
“Yes dear, we made a small slam. Indeed, we only
lost the other trick through my wretched partner trying
to finesse his jack of hearts.
“ Alice T. was there. She had on her old mauve silk.
Reallv I can’t understand her. If she could only see
herself in it. A fright, I assure you. The Bangcourts
were there, too, and the Tertium Quid. What Margaret
can see in the wretch I don’t know. The horrid,
whiskered creature, and her husband such a dear, too,
and so attentive and rich. Ah, well—l never talk scandal,
but there will be some startling denouement from that
quarter before very long, mark me.
“ Good gracious ! Is that really the time ? I must
simply fly home and dress. I always make a point of try-
ing to see the child at least once in a day. One cannot
neglect one’s duties. We meet again next month to dis-
cuss Browning further. One must do soiqething intel-
lectual nowadays. It is wonderful how clear Browning
is if one only takes the trouble to delve beneath
the surface. I have no patience with those people avho
say they cannot understand him.
'“ Well, good-bye, dears.”
My own account of the meeting of the Josh
Billings Society will appear when I am thoroughly
rested.
“ Peter Pan ” Brune has been frying at rehear-
sals in Sydney, much to the joy of her girl adorers.
That is to say, her girl adorers were glad she was
here, not that she was frying. They couldn’t
help the Indian summer falling heavily on Tittell.
Miss Brune is very chubby for the elf-like boy
who wouldn’t grow up, and she will probably have
to train down.
Those well-known Sydneysiders, the Hugh
Mac Neils, are put into mourning immediately on
their return from Europe, by the death of their
eldest daughter, Mrs. Atkinson, the wife of a
naval man who used to be on the Powerful. The
Atkinsons were living in England, and had only
been married two or three years.
“ Fairlight,” where the Butt-Rumford tuneful
two and family nested during their stay in
Sydney, has been re-occupied by its owners, the
Mac Neils, and the Butt babies Boy and Toy and
,Joy and Foy and Coy have had to turn out a week
sooner than the parent birds wished.
Talking of the stately humpies of Australia,
Uig Lodge, the Lachlan Beatons’ house, which
was vacated when the family, bar one, went to the
pleasant land of France, has been secured by Mr.
Something Gordon, who with his tribe isat present
dwelling abroad. Mrs. Gordon, who is a Portu-
guese, and a Countess in her own right, is an
uncommonly pretty woman, quite young, and
possessed of a bunch of pretty babies. Babies
will; of course, be “in” during the Dudley over-
lord'ship. Mrs. Gordon has wisely dropped her
title. In this old-voung country there is a ten-
dency to jeer at the Portuguese and Italian
peerage; and Turkish dukes and Swiss admirals
and even Baptist preachers from Central America
are not taken with that seriousness winch one
might expect.
Mrs. Hugh Dixson’s European holiday hasn’t
made her collar-proud. She is up to her motor
axles in work again. And one of her pet jobs is
to increase the thickness of the thread of kinship
between us and the Ma Country. The first meet-
ing of the Empire Day Celebration Committee
was held last week, when Mrs. Dixson presided.
Monday (May 25) has been selected by the State
Cabinet as the date for the celebration of next
Empire Day, and one of the items considered by
the Women Leaguers was the suggestion that an
oak tree be planted in the grounds of every school.
A large flight of musicianly persons assembled
to welcome Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Bradley, who
have torn themselves away from Scotland’s Glasgow
and its Choral Union, to come here and direct the
misfortunes of that rather moth-eaten bodj,
the Svdney Philharmonic. At least Mr.
Bradley will direct—Mrs. is a singer and
she will no doubt direct the director. After
the beknighted W. P. Manning had sympathised
with the strangers on their very natural home-
sickness, and told them that porridge could be
made here, and that heather and patches of rugged
strand might be found if closely searched for,
Minister for Education Hogue took up the same
theme, and bagpiped about the lack of charac-
teristic Australian music. Then “tea and light
refreshment” transpired—no haggis—and the
company dispersed, the majority of it asking one
another who were the Bradleys, and what had
they come here for.
The Royal Yacht Squadron, which lately
brushed the ashes out of its hair, and put off its
sackcloth for broadcloth, and gave another Floren-
tine evening, is expecting to shortly dip its ensign
(hope that is the correct jargon) to the Earl of
Westmorland and one or two other Somebodies
who will accompany him in a smart yacht, ihe
party is said to be en route to some coral strand
for buried treasure or for piratical purposes. Any-
how, it sounds romantic. The Earl is aged 49,
which is rather a mature period at which to take
the treasure-tiunting fever.
Next Saturday Miss Ola Humphrey will put off
the coronation robe of the lied Damsel in The
Prisoner of Zenda” and take on the cos-
tumes and wigs of Lady Blakeney in “ The Scarlet
Pimpernel.” The coronation robe is not hard
wearing during hot weather. At the back it is
cut down to all but the waist knuckle of the. spine,
only nary a knuckle does Ola show. Ihe very
slender damsel who does not show a bone or a
hollow when in dicoltete frocks must have tiny
bones, and of such build is Ola H. After three
nights of the be-wigged French charmer, “ The
Lady of Lyons ” will be resurrected, and pretty
well all Sydney under 20 years of age will sit pop-
eved and* with its ears forward listening to the
yards of honeved blank verse measured out by the
gardener’s son to the proud lady who isn’t in his
cabbage-patch set.
At the annual meeting of the Queen Victoria
Homes for Consumptives, last week, the chair-
man Dr Philip Sydnev Jones, mentioned grate-
fully the collection of £3OOO by Mrs. Allen Taylor
and other ladies who toiled in the charitable vine-
vard along with her during her term as Mayoress.
Mrs A. A. Dangar, Miss Margaret Harris, Mrs.
Walter Hall, and Miss Eadith Walker have also
contributed largely. Dr. Sinclair, who has charge
of the Homes, gave a record of many «ures. Ihe
balance-sheet showed that the institution is pav-
ing its way, but as accommodation is being pro-
vided for more patients, the chairman hopes the
flow of subscriptions will be a running river for
a while yet.
The Eric Mackay’s only daughter grand-
daughter of the late Edward Knox is
to marry Mr. Grenville Miller, R.N., private
secretary to Excellency Rawson. The event is
billed for to-morrow (Tuesday). The wedding
will fulfill that humorous order so peculiar to
country correspondents —the “quiet but pretty
wedding.” (Which alvyays reminds me of that
other famous press statement : “ His name is
Smith, hut it is thought he may recover.”) Miss
Doris Bloomfield, who will be bridesmaid, is
herself to be married in a month to Mr. Parbury.
That well-known yachtsman, Walter Marks,
and Mrs. have gone hence by the Moldavia on a
trip to the Old Cold Land.
Mr. James Mills, of the Union S.S. Co., and
his consort are on their way from Dunedin
(Maoriland), and due in Sydney for the Easter
Horse Rush.
The Major-General Babington, whom the cable
mentioned last week as having “ been appointed to
the command of the Lowland Mounted Brigade of
the territorial force ” is related to Australia by
marriage. He wedded a sister of “ Willie” Law-
son, of this State. It was an astute move on the
part of the latter youth—who inherited the acres
and things amassed by his ancestor, the explorer
—to rent a house in Sydney, and entertain indus-
triously when his female relatives •“ came out
some years back. The maidens thus went off early
knd well, and left their brother to a life of scholarly
and thoughtful ease, unbeset by the carking cares
that crowd upon the male matchmaker. Adrian
Knox, a brilliant Equity K.C. and a “possible
for the C.J’s billet when the present aged holder
shuffles into private life, won another Lawson
girl. The General referred to is no gout-smitten
bath-chair-haunting valetudinarian.

finger™ The ring watch is the latest jewellery
craze, though its origin seems to be hurly anc'cnb
for a certain Queen called Victoria, who, con-
sidering her general deadness, must have lived
centuries ago, is said to have had a weakness for
this class of timepiece. The Swiss watchmakers
are flooded with orders, for all the up to datest are
scrambling to wear clocks upon thenr fingers. It
is an expensive mania ; the c heapest fing _
set n. a plain gold band, costs £24, while jew elled
rings go as high as £lOOO. The plain band is much
favored, being worn over the glove on the third
finger of the right hand. Both sexes have been
grabbed by the mania, which is certain to infect
these parts sooner or later. When you see a
breathless individual fleeing madly for the morn-
ing tram with his eyes glued upon his right hand,
you will know that the craze is upon us.
The male representative of the famous Vaughan
family (Sydney knew an Archbishop of that ilk,
and Father Bernard self-advertises earnestly in
London society day by day) was due to be married
on March 3. An interesting circumstance about the
Vaughans is that for centuries one member has
always been in the army, and all the others m
the Church. Captain Charles Vaughan is the
present soldier of the family. Says London Daily
Mail (l/3/’08)
Father Bernard Vaughan, the bridegroom s uncle, wi 1
celebrate the marriage and the nuptial mass, and "ill
also preach the sermon. ....
The bridegroom’s three brothers, all of whom are
priests, will assist at the ceremony, and the sanctuary
will be occupied by the numerous members ot the
Vauvhan family who have joined the priesthood.
There are seven nuns in this family, which has
not been without both a priestly and a nunly mem-
ber for 500 years.
The Comte de Neiva, who, with his male
parent of Braganza, lived at the Union Club
for some months, a year or so back, and during
that time made considerable of a stir in society
and pigeon-massacring circles, has been doing
marvels in the polo world of Cannes in alliance
with one Radziwill, a Russian Prince, Sir Clifford
Cory and Lord Brougham and Vaux. Between-
times he has, according to the Leader (London),
“annexed 4000 dollars (£800) in stakes alone at
the Monte Carlo Tir au Pigeons.” The de Neiva
youth, fair, slight and rather vacuous in appear-
ance, proved something of a take-down to the
simple bookie when in these parts. Looking as
though he ought to be wearing a monocle, spats
and other appurtenances of the totally incom-
petent, he ambled out to one of the urban gun
clubs shortly after his arrival, and was lightly
handicapped. He showed a desire to “ plunge ’
recklessly on himself, and the pencillers hurried
forward burning to accommodate the stranger
within their gates. After the newcomer had
blown 22 birds running to atoms, and collected
large handfuls of gold and notes in connection
with each separate assassination, the betting
brothers began to glimpse dimly that there was
something more than luck in the business. They
wailed aloud, and the gentle foreigner was asked
to retreat a few yards further from the traps.
This he did with much affability, and repeated
his former performance. Not till the apparently
futile youth had been stationed among the utter-
fnost back-markers—the champions of the State—
did the outraged persons whom Judkins loathes
begin to get a little of their own back.
“ Mario ” from Brisbane :
Mr. and Mrs. Clara Butt Rumford were the guests of
honor at a vice-regal lunch on Wednesday, and the vice-
regal lady bad a select party to meet them. It included
stout John Forrest and his slender Missus, Premier Kidsto i
and his wife, the De Burgh Persses, the Yandilla Gores,
Miss McConnel, Miss Hart, Dick Newton and the Ramsay
couple Mrs. Clara ate in a striking grey gown, a grey
hat that was mostly plume, and a boa to match.
On the proceeding Tuesday, t he singers were the guests
of the aforesaid stout John Forrest, at a garden party at
the Queensland Club, of which exclusive institution John
is president. The vice-regal dame was among the guests
having hurried thither (in a grey-blue striped silk and a
crev hat) from a Mothers’ Union special senioe at All
Saints’ Church. Madam of the Voice, walked with her
lord in a gown of vieux rose crfepe, and ivory chiffon;
with a hat and boa to match, and the hostess chose a
e-own of blue linen, Irish crochet, and a black hat with
coque plumes. Tea was served upon the lawn to about
200 of the Very Best People. , .
In the evening - , a big crowd went to near the sinjjersin
the Exhibition Hall, and approved of them to such an
extent that next night one couldn’t have got a thin old
maid in with a shoehorn at 8 o clock. The Chelmsford
fa.milv with the new governess and the tired Newton in
tow, were there both nights.
There was the usual flower show, and on the second
evening much feminine ecstacy over the famous “grape
dress” (a much over-rated garment, in my humble
opinion) and some lovely diamonds. The Voice let itself
mo in “The Promise of Life.” Brisbane-sleepy, phleg-
matic Brisbane—arose and shook off the lethargy of half
a centurv It, yelled, it cheered, it raved and cast itself
ut the feet of'the fathom and four inches of bowing
woman (she crumples up nicely when she’s saying a dumb
“thank you”) A similar outburst greeted Kennerley
Rumford’s “ Sands of Dee,” only there were a good many
tears also that time. . T - .
After all the Women s Club is all right, for I ran into a
stately vice-president inquiring for new quarters for the
revived catterv-and, judging by her requirements, there
is a heap of life in the concern yet. I even hearrumorsof
i he annual dinner.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, March 30, 1008.
My Dear Yarrik.—
At the opening of the British picture show one
couldn’t see the paintings on canvas by reason of
the crush. The tall Twobottles were present in
state; jn fact, the opening ceremony was per-
formed by Himself. He was quite at sea when
he launched his eloquence upon J. Lake and the
works thereof. He referred in square—indeed
octagonal—periods to any number of subjects that
haven’t a place m a gilt frame ; and he spoke of
the only Joshua as "Mr. West.” Whereupon
Lady Talbot drew down her lip and fiercely
ejaculated “ Lake ! Lake ! ”
There were all sorts of people talking High Art
in voices pitched in appropriate keys. There
were artists, and artists’ women folk, and mer-
chants, and their feminine belongings. In the
matter of tasteful frocking the traders ran away
from the artistic section. Mrs. Ernest Keep was
a joyous relief from the remainder of the crowd
in a charming robe of silky mauve, made in modi-
fied Empire fashion, with garnishings of gold and
silver, and splendid lace. Her hat was a har-
monious halo of ostrich feathers J and she looked
like a colored plate from La Mode in motion.
Lady Talbottle wore a velours frock of blue, with
a sombre hat. Mrs. Laurie Abrahams smiled
broadly out of the smartest arrangement of black
over white ; and a grey-haired sister was lidded
with the girliest of hats in black and pink.
Mrs. Frank Luxton was in wine-red with black
furs. Mis. Frank Madden, of course, had on
something tight-fitting and black, a tall
daughter in checks beside her. Mrs. McEacharn,
in the wake of her Malcolm (who now has an
English drawl, bless your heart !) was a violet
glare from hem to hat. To emphasise the yellow
of her hair she had a back comb punctuated with
three huge gold knobs, which looked like the
hangers of a mont-de-piete.
But these details are negligible. What was
reallv interesting was the atmosphere, and the
excerpts from many conversations which drifted
to one’s ears. And the bobbings of Sassiety to
the “ Stonington ” pair. Apparently to be comme
il faut, you must jerk yourself into the most
inelegant squatting position for a fleeting second.
Then, if you haven’t lost your balance and sat on
the floor, or split your sheath skirt, you heave
yourself straight again, and simper with conscious
superiority at the people who don t get a chance
to do the bob and dip and heave in public.
The Willie Kelly couple escape the unblinking
eye of a hotel public this week, and take
refuge in Melbourne Mansions. There they’ve
hired Teddy Ilallenstein’s gorgeous Hat, where
Mistress Morell-Kelly can experiment with her
William’s digestion, and do other deeds in the
housekeeping line. At Menzies’ the poor things
have been in the nature of a peep-show. People
who haven’t dined out for years have been rolling
up in sounds, just for the sake of a look at the
man who married Miss Morell.
Mrs. Arral farewelled to a cheering house on
Saturday night, and she sang as tirelessly as a
bird, though the audience demanded even treble
encores, and sent the warbler through an amazing
repertoire. The house had a strong French leaven-
ing. Commodore Buchard, and Mrs. Buchard,
and some of the officers of the cruiser Catinat
were in evidence, and Consul Maistre and Mr. and
Mrs. Edouard Say headed a concert party, and
huge, grey-haired Mr. Bioje rose head and
shoulders over the company in the chairs.
The acting-Gaud Mayor and Mayoress jewelled
the centre balcony, and a lorgnetted daughter
stared superciliously. The rotund Premier,
patron of the Arts, lolled in his cushioned seat.
The Holroyd lady brought a party of young
people, and Archbishop Carr lent the beneficence
of Ins presence. I he beautiful Irench-Dutch
youth Vanderkelen rested contentedly after his
energetic work committeeing. Papa and mama
Yon Pinschof beamed from the balcony on their
singing chick —who performed as a minor star.
The fair Heinze sat far away from the Von-con-
sular party with Prof. Marshall-Hall’s son.
Hal Elvins, whose popularity grows fast, accom-
panied the concerters, and the star’s sweet warble
was backed by the organ (in Dr. Price’s hands)
and a full orchestra, with Levi as conductor, and
flautist Pett as soloist.
The Arral warbler has the dramatic bump so
fully developed that she indulges in a lightnmg-
change-artist way of expressing her song moods in
dress. The purely technical beauties of her over-
ture saw an ice-maiden garb of frigid white and
silver. The next group of songs brought an Arral
garbed in Parisienne black—a Worth gown with
all its joysome embroidery traced on in tiny
jewels. In a furious encore, yards of this black
frilly-frou caught on an unhappy celloist s chair,
and madame’s smile had a steely glitter.
A peppery little French song saw quite another
Arral—garbed in scarlet and yellow. It was a
Jan Van Beer sketch—the black of Mrs. Blanche s
hair with the gold and red. The dress was pro-
bably painted on during the interval—no human
power could have fitted frocking to such a painful
point in the time. For the final and triumphant
“Mignon” the sweet singer melted into a creation
of soft shades of sunset afterglow.
Carmen Pinschof showed herself a good concert
singer—quiet and sweet and clear.
Mrs. Arral laughs gleefully at her struggles
with our English. She sang “Lo ! Here the
Gentle Lark!” in most perfect English at her
concert. But “Was there ever such a word as
‘riseth’?” she chortled. ‘‘l practise heem for
hours,” she exclaimed, “ but I triumph !”
Pretty Carmen Pinschof wore her Women’s
Exhibition medals proudly at the Arral warble.
Three there are, hung on conservatorium ribbons
—one for the best vocal solo, another for the finest
mezzo warble, and still another for the best alto.
She also has ten huge diplomas (all musical) from
the Cats’ Show, and had some thought of bring-
ing an attendant page to bear the weighty honors.
Miss Paula Scherek, who only the other day
was an artless schoolgirl, has just returned from
London with brother Geoff under one wing and
her violin case under the other. The damsel is an
accomplished musician these days, with a naively
dignified manner to help out her music. Both the
young Schereks go on to Christchurch shortly to
join Pa Benno who is settling down over there to
be a sort of local J. and N. Tait, a mentor of
music, or some other aged substance.
“ Under instructions from the Trustees Execu-
tors and Agency C 0.,” “ Maysbury,” the lovely
home of the late Mr. John Morris, with all
effects therein, goes to the highest bidder —and
all because of a flaw in the will. Catalogued is a
photo in oils of Mrs. Maesmore Morris, by Fuchs,
Court artist: Sevres china, once the property of
the King of Prussia, and so on, even to the
dining-room suite made in Venice, after the
Italian Renaissance style. Every piece t»f bric-a-
brac has its history. The family might have kept
these art collections if the Dowager Morris had
taken more care over her will.
There is cabled from London the marriage, this
week, of Miss Lily See, of your city, to Mr.
W. A. Anderson, of the big Sydney hat-making
firm that made the amazing and ridiculous fuss
about the Six Hatters.
Dr. Charlie Ryan leaves next month for Bull’s
Own Country. Mrs. Charlie, with her young
daughter, has spent the last twelve months
abroad. They will return with the doctor to the
land of wattle and sunshine.
On Saturday afternoon the Press Bond gave
itself its annual picnic. This year the event
occurred at Heidelberg, and the sky wept
copiously over the indiscretion. (Except in
spring, Heidelberg is like a cemetery bereft of its
tombstones.) The press divided into three sections
when it arrived at the local recreation-ground ;
two of them played cricket while the other
cheered loudly. One team managed with great
difficulty to score eighty. The other didn’t
score at all, to the public knowledge. After-
wards tea was served at the Olde England
Inn. Things brightened up then. President
Davidson, picturesque and kindly, saw that every-
one was fed—a difficult feat considering that there
were 190 hungry journalists and their sisters and
wives on the premises. Afterwards the Argus
danced with the Age and the Herald stood in a
corner and recited to itself. And eventually
everyone ran for the last train, and nobody
managed to miss it (an achievement in Heidelberg).
Witty Miss McGowan maintained the dignity
of the pettieoated pen with perfect ease.. She
always manages by her humor and vim to justify
the existence of women in newspaper offices. Mrs.
Klisser, charming in a tailor-made and roguish
hat, was another pleasing attribute of the Age.
Ruby Lindsay and Edward Dyson’s pretty sister
posecl beside each other, looking like up-to-date
versions of White-Rose and Rose-Red in the old
fairy-tale. And a batch of Percy Reay’s women-
kind clung to their large relative for most of the
evening.
A bleached and bedizened Beauty has been
“knocking things” at a swagger Flat, with the
strong backing of a withered and ancient retainer
(who is her “ trusted companion ”), a plump and
healthy story of high connections, and a plentiful
supply of the thing a love of which is the tap-
root of all evil. But all the careful Family
Herald story has been busted by the unfortunate
second death of Papa, who was of a very humble
class indeed, though he had been able to
supply the needful for all the gorgeousness.
Papa in the Family HERALD-ish story had been
dead long ago—beheaded in the Tower of London,
or something like that—and the real pegging-out
of the real ancestor was a worse blow than the
bogus one got on the neck with the axe.
The son of an Australian magnate loved a
maid who wasn’t up to his cash standard. He did
this deed in spite of parental remonstrance. Pa
and ma Magnate then assumed such a disinherit-
ing expression as to cause a fracture of the son’s
matrimonial intentions. Then the maid talked of
damages for break-of-promise. Ma Magnate
compromised quietly with £3OOO. Thereupon the
lovers slipped away and got married. Their nest-
egg for housekeeping is exactly £3OOO. And there
is a lurid whirl of language on Pa’s part, and per-
haps, too, on Ma’s.
The Frederic Beard concerts loom nearer. The
first will take place on Saturday afternoon, 11th
April. The Superior tribe is patronising it cheer-
fully. Lady Talbot and the Madden couple will
necessitate red carpet on the first occasion, and
the Northcote dame promises her appreciative
presence later on. More than a quarter of the
works which the courageous Frederic will conduct
are unknown here. “A beautiful scarlet thing
of Dvorak’s”—the very one which inspired Wilde
to that phrase—will be played at the first concert.
Themanagement naively announces that this series
is “ given solely in the interests of, and for the
advancement of, musical art.” Which is cap-
tivating. Hitherto our impresarios have not
tired to disguise that anything they attempted
was solely in the interest of the musical artist.

his letters and a grin, had mounted into his milk
cart and majestically driven off.
Some interest is centring on a versatile brun-
ette, who from time to time makes a sensational
descent upon this city She makes periodical
retirements to papa’s huge station—apparently
for the purpose of pondering a new shock for hei
metropolitan acquaintances. Last time she
down, welted shoes, green veils, and religion were
her specialties. This time a motor—which she
drives in stately solitude and a scarlet over-all is
her usual pastime. Dame Gossip says that the
damsel is on the brink of matrimony, and he
fellow diver insists that she’s to givei up religion
and cultivate the gift of silence. Wherefore the
ingenue girl has sought and found a way g
stared at and talked about without once open-
ing her lips for the purpose of saying anything
more than “ Reahly ?”
Mrs. Deakin who, in spite of her seeming
quietude, is the most strenuous worker at the
loom of goodness, has been ill for her pains. Her
medicine man has ordered her to cry a halt, and
she goes into solitude up in our mountains. Xhe
Prime Minister is to spend with her and the
woodlands what leisure the nation allows him.
One point about-big official visits—because of
them we do have a spring-cleaning now and then.
The Duke of York caused our dingy Yarra banks
to blossom with the rose, and now the coming
Americans send Port Melbourne Harbor keepers
into a flurry of brooming. Rats are to be shooed
off and scraps of banana-peel picked up, and the
piers are to be spruced-up generally.
Hopetoun willed Wallington £2OOO. Walling-
ton-of-the-Wellington-nose nowadays looks after
the morning Tub of His Royal Highness, as Groom
of the Chamber. Also, he fetches the boap. I hat
legacy was richly earned. Secretary Wallington
saved the youthful Governor many a hard bump
with his ’cute, keen tact, and his velvet “ Better
not.” His quizzical eye knew all the outer Cats
who claw at the phantom fringe of Sassiety,
and scramble like maniacs for pasteboard scraps
from the Guv’ment ’Ouse table. He saw, and
grinned, and counter-stroked.
It is murmured that the Prince of Wales is to
be asked (with his three feathers) to our Uncle
Sam party. That’s dazzling ! But, after all, it s
only the same Duke of York show under different
management.
The bronze face of statued Fitzgibbon smiles
grimly. His opportune rising in the shadow of
the “Domain site” at the beginning of the hos-
pital controversy has borne effect. One more
reserve is saved, and "Fitz’s” ghost takes its
midnight walks abroad with a lighter step.
About 100 of the coldest girls in Australia
shivered at the St. Kilda baths on Saturday, when
the first carnival of the new ladies’ swimming
club was carried out. The piercing wind would
have produced icicles on a boiling kettle, but the
mermaids faced the music pluckily, and stood
about in their wet costumes till their teeth chat-
tered. Champion Lily Beaurepaire was amongst
the competitors, and, though only a little over 15
years of age, her plump, sun-bronzed figure
compared favorably even with that of crack
diver Dolly Cooper, who is reckoned the
Venus of the club. Of course men were strictly
barred, but some of the girls in abbreviated
clothes stood round on the fences ana waved their
hands to the boys in the baths adjoining. It was
the plump girls who did this sort of thing ; the
wispy ones preserved a studied seclusion. Three
male reporters were allowed a view of pro-
ceedings from a window about 20yds. dis-
tant on condition that they turned away
their heads as the girls “ emerged.” The French
cruiser Catinat fired such a stirring 15-gun salute
during the proceedings that some of the girls fell
in from the starting platform in sheer fright. In
one of the races a merry maiden fainted, and
gave the life-savers a job. The curious circum-
stance is that most of the competitors are girls
who swim every Saturday during the season in
the special ladies’ events, provided at the men’s
open carnivals ; yet they shut themselves in like
nuns when holding a dip-affair of their own. But
on this particular occasion it was just as well. No
girl looks her best when in an aggravated state of
goose flesh.
At Government House t’other day the general
committee, the sub-committees, and the inter-
sub-prize-catmittees of the Women’s Exhibition
partied most amiably together. They went in a
purring flock to present Lady Northcote with a
comprehensive souvenir. It was a “woman’
book, a leather-bound volume with a hand-
tooled design of gum-leaves (bound by
Mrs. Chapman), filled with examples and
photographs of women’s work and exhibi-
tion details. Little Ida Rentoul inscribed
and illustrated the first page, and autographs
straggled over half-a-dozen sheets. There was a
manuscript copy of Mrs. Ewart’s Ode, and another
of Mrs. Conductor Peterson’s song, “A Little
Aboriginee.” All the ohoir, all the orchestra, and
all the brass band shouted in photographic unison.
There were pictures of the creche and the model
nursery, and—no, there was not a phonographic
record of the yells. Leading women artists have
sketched on the voluminous pages, and it would
be hard to say what was left out. The Talbottle
lady presented the bulky thing with a few Gentle-
man Helps propping up her elbows. She speeched
in doubtful compliment that in “some dull
moment in the old Motherland ” her G.-G.
Excellency would find something in the tome to
revive pleasant memories. One had visions of
Her Brilliancy sitting on the floor of the lumber
room on a wet day turning ponderous leaves and
thanking her lucky stars there was no committee
meeting to attend.
The Carpet was present at the presentation, and
the Blue Gum walking-stick and various other
trophies gathered round wistfully. Arrangements
are being made for a barge, loaded with the North-
cotes’ farewell tokens, to hitch" on behind the
steamer in which the two will tear themselves
away.
From “Rosna” (Adelaide):—
The unfeeling conduct of the elements nearly wrecked
things frocky for the Mayoral reception on Thursday last
hut about 2 p.m. the weather stopped weeping and dried
its eyes on a cloud, and the populace hurried into its new
autumn raiment, tucked its gamp under its arm, and ran
helter-skelter to town. It was a well-managed spree
There was actually enough seating accommodation for all
comers, and the hungry crowd that struggled for tea got
it Our new Mayor, Mr. Frank Johnson, wafted a jolly
smile around, and for two solid hours he and Mrs. Mayfield
stood firmly to receive the aggregate bows and scrapes of
the multitude. Mrs. Mayfield was frocked in a smart
navy gown, with a handsome under-bodice of cream lace
and passementerie, and did the heavy-lifting act with a
gorgeous pale-pink bouquet. Miss Mayfield wore a pretty
pale-green frock, with dark-green passementerie, and a
smart green hat with a splendid fat pink rose nestling in
a bed of green ribbon. She’s a jolly-looking little maiden.
One of the most gorgeous frocks present was decorated
by tall and graceful Mrs. Luther Scammell, lately back
from Europe. It was a resida silk voile, exquisitely
embroidered. The accompanying crowning glory
was a fine white straw, with black ostrich
plumes. Which reminds me that the plume of
the afternoon was sported by another lately-returned
traveller, Miss Jacobs. It was the latest thing in British
feathers, and it curled wickedly round her hat and over
her shoulder, and was lost to view afar off among the
folds of her skirt. The eye of the populace was glued
firmly to that plume all the afternoon. Also there were
several hundred other notable frocks.
The latest engagement is that of Minna, elder daughter
of the squatting Gebhardt family, and Mr. Heinicke, of
the Conservatorium staff, who teaches the young idea to
play the cat instrument. The event is due about August.
Humpt.v Dumpty ” is here, and doing well. Adelaide
may be a one-horse town—it may even be a tram-horse
town, but no pantomime can sa,v it was ever sent hungry
away from our hospitable doors. In “ Humpty ” Ade-
laide finds a panto, after its own gushing heart, and it is
going to have Phydora’s yellow-and-blaek satin outfit
copied to wear at tiie S.A.J.C. races on Saturday.
One of our warbling demoiselles, Meta Bering, returned
from several years’ European voice-training the other
day. She was’a singularly tuneful Miss before she went
away, and, as she has collected many laurels in remote
countries, we expect something intense in bird trills.
The singing profession begins to wear the frenzied look of
over-competition, now that so many foreign-polished
warblers are crowding back into it. The latest to hang
out her sign is the recently-returned Ethel Hantcke.
Mrs. Charles Rasp, wife of one of the lucky discoverers
of Broken Hill, rushed away for a jaunt in Germany last
week, taking with her her sister, Miss Kleversahl. By
the same boat went the B. A. Mouldens and Mrs. and Miss
Von Doussa. By the Moldavia, on April 2, that beauteous
f rocker (or frock'-coaterj, Mr. Abe Shannon, deserts us, and
once more seeks the frivolities and fashions of London.
He’s an exceedingly kind-hearted, as well as well-dressed
giant, and the girlv element weeps loudly that he will not
be on hand to guide it through the intricacies of the
dancing season. :■->
The Lyric Club is preparing to burst open its season
directly'we are released from the trammels and the
sombre suits of Lent. Its first event will occupy the
evening of April 27.
A horde of enthusiastic amateurs are busily rehearsing
“A Midsummer’s Night Dream.” They intend to pro-
duce it several times, once, ’tis said, as a pastoral play in
the Gardens.

510 the Melbourne eiti-
| zeti Sydney inspires,
j in one sense, the
[ same feeling as Mecca
'l to the true Mussul-
man. Once in his life he
would wish to see it scarcely in
the mood of a religious pilgrim it
is true —though there is just a little suggestion
of duty in a visit as to warrant the parallel.
Otherwise, it is all otherwise. For a reverent and
lowly mien the Melbourne visitor substitutes a
demeanor of excitable anticipation. His imagina*
tion, conjures up a picture of veritable en-
chantment. In his mind’s eye he can see a
noble city overlooking a harbor of magnificent
natural beauties, unsurpassed in its numerous
picturesque bays, and unequalled, both as a
tourist resort and a safe harborage for the largest
vessels ever built. And the reality quite justifies
his glowing anticipation.
As the steamer, in which he has journeyed
round from Melbourne (for of course he has elected
to travel in one of the splendid steamships of the_
Five Companies), approaches Sydney Heads, say,
in' the early morning, he perceives the high
sandstone bluff of North Head and the rocky
heights of South Head, upon which is perched
the famous Macquarie Lighthouse that, at night,
glitters to them even thirty miles out at sea. But
it is not until the steamer has safely negotiated
the entrance that the true beauty and wonder
of the scene is revealed slowly. Ahead,
and becoming more distinct as the steamer
creeps nearer, is the jutting promontory of Middle
Head, which divides Middle Harbor from the
Harbor proper; while, little by little the sandy
beaches and wooded slopes of Watson’s, Rose,
Double, and Rushcutters’ Bays, with their delight-
fully-situated villa residences, are passed in suc-
cession. Now can be seen the blue expanse of
Middle Harbor receding into the distance, and
the wharves and huge ocean-going mail steamers
at Circular Quay, with Sydney itself as an inter-
esting and pleasing background. Then, round-
ing Dawes’ and Miller’s Points, the steamer
finally brings up at one of the many
landing-places in Darling Harbor—and
the anticipatory Melbourne traveller is
at last in the city of his dream.
Having found suitable ac-
commodation (which is the
first essential), the Melbourne
stranger naturally saunters
forth to view the sights, and
the first thing that will
excite his interest is the
complete and efficient electric
tram servce, which, installed
within the last few years, adequately attends to
the demands of an increasing Sydney traffic.
Boarding one of these trams, the visitor can be
taken at,greater speed than that'to which he is
accustomed to any part of the city and its environs
—two exceedingly agreeable journeys being those
to Bondi and Coogee, probably, next to Manly,
the most popular resorts for surf bathing in the
open But one of the first visits should be to
the Botannical Gardens overlooking Farm Cove.
Divided into lawns, fiowpr-beds and shady
groves, by many well-kept walks and drives, these
notable gardens furnish a retreat, the merits of
which are further enhanced by the excellence of
the seaward view. Below, skirted by a sandstone
wall, are the waters of the pretty inlet, upon
which may be seen the ships of the Australian
Naval Squadron riding at anchor, with numerous
types of sailing craft flitting in and out —the
whole completing a scenic delight that will not be
readily forgotten. Also, further seaward, constant
sources of attention are the busy ferry steamers
plying between Circular Quay and Manly, and
Watson’s and Neutral Bays. Now, taking one of
the many by-paths through the Inner Domain,
the visitor finds himself .in Macquarie-street,
where, he may inspect, in turn, the command-
ing structures of the Treasury, Public Library,
Mitchell Library, Parliament House, and Mint;
~ and further along, in College-street, behold
the noble edifice known as St. Mary’s R.C.
Cathedral. Turning now to the busier portions
of the city, two buildings that invite more than
passing comment, are the G.P.O. and the
Town Hall. The former, colonaded on two sides
with pillars of polished grey granite, occupies the
whole of one side of Martin Place between George
and Pitt-streets ; while the latter is memorable in
two respects (if not in others) on account of the
size of its main hall, capable of seating 5000
people, and on account of its great pipe organ,
said to be the most complete in the world. Beside
these, there are alsd the Queen Victoria Markets,
the new Central Railway Station at Rcdfern, the
gigantic structure of Anthony Hordern’s New
Palace Emporium on Brickfield Hill ; the
Museum, the National Art Gallery in the Domain,'
and many, many others. Other places claiming
the attention of the traveller are Fort Macquarie
and Dawes Battery, situated on the promon-
tories on either side of Sydney Cove; the
Cricket Ground and Zoological Gardens in Moore
Park; the well-known Randwick racecourse;
and the historic Centennial Park. Then! there
are the delightful trips to all points of the Harbor,
from Lane Cove and Parramatta Rivers on the
west, to Watson’s Bay on the east.
Naturally, the Melbourne visitor will not care
to return to Melbourne without a glimpse at the
many entrancing pieces of scenery in the Blue
Mountains. By talcing the train to Katoomba the
traveller will see much to astonish, and much to
recall in after life. Katoomba, itself, is situated
over three thousand feet above sea level, and,
strangely enough, it is necessary to travel dqwn hill
a little, in order to witness the finest panoramic
sights. At the hhad of the Leura Falls, adjacent
to Katoomba, the visitor may behold a scene of
simply titanic grandeur. By some convulsion of
Nature in the long ago, the tableland beneath
appears to have been rent into enormous
chasms, and, gazing down, one may contemplate
the floor of the Leura gorge 2000 ft. below, the
precipices on either side rising as straight as walls
for hundreds of feet. It is indeed possible to
descend into the gloom of the chasm, and walk
through luxuriant forest growths comprising
typical Australian ferns and wild flowers. Other
falls in the vicinity are the Wentworth,
the Minnihaha, and Govett’s Leap, which,
reached by a short walk from Blackheath,
excites wonderment by its clear drop of over
500 feet into the valley below. Then again, from
the Medlow Hydropathic establishment may be
observed the superb panoramic effects of the
Kanitnbla Valley, with its green and living carpet
of forest trees. Now any, even a cursory, descrip-
tion of Blue Mountain scenery cannot fail to omit
the justly-famous Jenolan Caves, the beauties of
which have been extolled throughout Australasia.
They have been described in minute detail over
and over again ; and it will be, or should be, suffi-
cient to say that the wonders of their limestone
formations into all manner of cunning and ex-
quisite patterns must be seen to be appreciated.
They are reached by a splendid coach-drive from
Mount Victoria, which, in itself, is an object of
much admiration.
■ But that-is not all. Who has not heard of the
unexampled splendors, the boating, fishing, and
camping facilities of the Hawkesburv River ; of
the Southern Tableland ; of Kiama and its Blow-
hole ; of Mount Keira, near Wollongong ; of the
Bulli Pass, which, in rugged grandeur, beggars
description ; of,Newcastle ; of the Yarrangobillv
Caves, near Cooma-; of Lake Macquarie; of
countless other resorts, and has not wished to see
them ? Well, the above and
the approaching Easter
season should provide
an ample excuse for
the Melbourne citir
zen to secure a
berth in one of
the steamers of
the Five Companies,
and depart joyously
for Sydney town.


Biliousness
Headache and dizziness are natural con-
sequences of constipation, which in its turn
is due to a sluggish state of the liver. It is
the impurities with which these diseases load
your blood that cause all the trouble, and
before permanent relief can be obtained
these impurities must be got rid of. Take
Mother Seigel’s Syrup. This great medicine
regulates the liver and bowels, restores
digestion, and cleanses your whole system.

Then I went in and told him that there "as no other

On hearing this, Himey fell down dead.
“N.” discourses in a -large, loose way
I give no clue to the locality in this case, so as to hurt
nobody, but it is a fact-with some kind of n oral. A fe
days ago there died the husbands! a very clever woman,
f know her and admire her. Yet it surprises me that
with all my Paul Pry instincts as a journalist, I never
found out who her husbarid was till his obituary appeal ed
in the paper. Let me say that the wife attended him
devotedly, and there never could be a question of an}
serious cloud between them. Yet he was a man in very
humble life, and she is a woman who blazes before the
world with high talent. Her conversation is sought by
the intellectual, and there is a great deal to find in it.
She has travelled the globe over, welcome everywhere
while hubby ground away at his humble work in never
mind where. She could have kept him doing nothing,
but he would toil while there was a pound of energy left
in him. He must be independent, even of his wife.
I will leave the specific case and go to the general case.
My observations may not apply at all to the specific, but
here they are : A man marries a woman in his own
station. He wants, and she wants, to build up a home.
They wish to live for each other, as spouses ought, borne-
times the man develops (say) as a politician. Of that,
examples crowd upon me. The home may not be
wrecked, but the wife’s ideal is gone in most cases. The
Seddons are exceptions. The woman craves for her man
at home when work is done. The busy political, or busy
religious, or general busy gadding husband is a bugbear
to her. The strands of the rope are pulled out. Now'
take the abnormal development of a wife. Galooseley
reads essays on Tom Hood, Ulliver Crumbwell, and what
not, before the Church Literary Society. Suddenly his
wife, after sundry taunts, while they remained most
happy, flares forth w'ith topical essays which he regards
as arrant rot, but they exalt her to a phenomenon. She
getsinto fash’n’ble newspapers, and makes money, which
he could never do. Happiness is gone. Tom Centrebit’s
wife was a worshipped doll till she amazingly developed
into a medical woman. Happiness gone again.
The fact is every disturbance of tbe plane is at the cost
of the happiness of both parties. Ignorance w-as bliss.
Take some historical cases. What an impudent fellow
was the husband of Dante’s Beatrice. Who would like
to be a Mr. Humphrey Ward, or a Mr. Langtry ? History
contemptuously records that John Stuart Mill only took
away a dry-salter’s wife. All we ‘hear of poor Taylor is
Dry-Salter. That’s enough. If Petrarch can collar his
Laura, he will. Genius must extend a hand like a whale’s
I ear. Sala is beautifully contemptuous on Mr. Kiddell,
husband of the novelist, putting his spoke into intellec-
tual conversation.
“ Xue ” (Oxford, England) discourses on
Britain’s foreign legions
The cheap and undesirable alien pervades this crowded
little country. Even in Scotland, where Jews can’t eke
out a livelihood, the coal mines of Fifeshire are largely
worked by Poles and Galicians, whose English is a neglj.
gible quantity and whose Scotch only amounts to n
request for whisky. In London whole districts are given
over to various forms of furriner. In any part of the town
a Swiss or German brings you your food. In Soho, the
Greek and Italian and Russian hold supreme swav, and
occasionally cut out a'constable’s kidneys. In White,
chapel even Bill Sikes has had to give up
owing to foreign competition, and Nancy is now
known as Bathsheba or Naomi, or something out
of the Old Testament. In parts of Whitechapel
the former haunt of fine old English ruffianism,
the notices over the shops are all written in strange
characters which the policeman tells us are Yiddish.
Every butcher advertises “ Kosher” meat-he whodoesn’t
Kosh must go. The aforesaid policemen know Yiddish
as well as English, and use it more. There is a huge new
theatre where none but Y’iddish plays are produced.
Visited recently a low-down boxing saloon in London.
The fighting men were all British. But the audience-
-3000 strong—had hooked noses, and sleek hair, and large
glass tie-pins, and in a guttural foreign tongue they laid
and took odds about the Britons who were fighting in the
middle for their amusement. The stray Gaul who strolled
into the circus, and watched his countrymen fight before
the effete Roman mob, cannot have felt pleased. The
Englishman seems to be getting out of Merrie England
as fast as he can, and making way for the foreigner who
wouldn’t come there only that he has been persecuted
out of his own country.
One of the alleged hogs says he isn’t, but
somebody else is : -
No one but motorists themselves know their troubles.
The motorist, whether he be in a £lOOO car or merely
perched on a greasy sporting bike, is widely hated and
purposely annoyed. The real road-hog is rarely the
motorist, but generally the men with hare-brained colts
in high gigs, who fancy that because they’re using the
road "no one else has any right to be on the earth. With-
out the least regard for the poor devil of a motorist’s
s ifety, these road-hogs force him into the treacherous
sand bed and übiquitous wheel-rut. I saw a fellow get
out of a motor, the other day, haul a hog out of a trap,
and give him the mother and father of a hiding. He
needed it, because he simply tried to murder the motorist
bv forcing him into a drain, and that motorist was much
more useful alive than forty hogs. Again, if a repair is
required, the charges amount to plain robbery, while if
spirit is needed, the trader becomes a pirate. I have had
to pay ss. a gallon for common benzine instead of Is. 3d,,
because the brute who sold it knew I was stuck and
must have it. The worst of it is, there’s no way of deal-
ing with these cows. It’s actually a hanging matter if
you slay them.
“ Dux ” : I have never met the Man with
the Hoe, but I dodged his brother, the Man with the
Scythe, at a down-town pub last night. The Man
with the Scythe had apparently been liquoring up,
and he reached the Harp o’ Erin half-sprung.
Breasting the bar, he called for a “ plate of lush,”
and caused quite a stir by the risky way he car-
ried a scythe across his right shoulder. He dived
into his pocket for the sixpence, and the elongated
blade swung round in dangerous proximity to a
toff’s upraised liqueur-glass. The toff retired,
discoloring the atmosphere with vivid' language.
Swinging round to face the expostulator, the
Man with the Scythe swept the counter-
lunch into the wash-up bucket, and looking
back to view the* smash, he mowed down
a whole row of schooner glasses with a crash like
Niagara Falls. Then; Bung rushed in with the
light of bottle in his eye, and dashed at the man
with the rusty blade, as'they did in bygone days.
After that, things hummed. Port, Creme de
Menthe, and Watson’s whisky fell in rapid suc-
cession. Cherry brandy, Haig and Haig’s, and a
dozen of cognac came down with a run. The site
of battle changed with remarkable swiftness to
the passage-way, where several yards of cheap
prints smote the floor in one hit. But Bung
gained the upper hand, and once in the backyard
he rushed the disturber of the peace, and threw
him 138 pt. into the next block, and the fearsome
blade, somersaulting 394yd5., cut the horizon in
two pieces and sank into the harbor.

MARK HAMBOURG,

writing' on “ The Life of a Piano,” says
in His Article in “ Cassell’s Magazine,”
January, 1908 :
It may, perhaps, interest my readers to learn that the life
of a piano made for public performances on the concert
platform is comparatively a short one, I would never play
on the same piano in public more than fifteen times. These
pianos are peculiarly constructed. They are infinitely more
fragile than an ordinary instrument, and are not intended
to last for a very long time. Sometimes I have had to
give up a piano after having played only six times on it,
and after every performance the instrument, no matter how
good a one it may be, has to be completely overhauled and
tuned before it is fit to play again.**
That statement cannot apply to the
BEALE AUSTRALIAN PIANOS.

The illustration at the left hereof shows the wooden wrest-plank of an imported horizontal Grand.
Every imported piano has a wooden wrest-plank.
Note the two hundred and forty wrest-pins. Each one of these is hammered tightly into a hole
drilled in the plank. Each one therefore is like a there are two hundred and forty of them.
."'i m.
Look how close they are.
When the wires (or “strings”) are attached, each wedge becomes in addition a lever. Two hundred
and forty icedge levers in a single wooden plank!
The direct pull of the strings, tuned to concert pitch, totals thirty tons. No wooden plank can
stand such a wrenching, bursting strain for long, not even though it is made of several plies of selected
timber. Consequently the pins, which ought to be immovable, are turned backwards by the pull of the
strings, and the piano is out of tune.
That is why imported Grand pianos have to be re-tuned before each concert.
But the frequent tuning is very harmful, for the constant turning of the pins backwards and forwards
makes them ever looser. So the trouble goes on from bad to worse, and soon the piano must be discarded
for concert use.
But in the Beale Australian Pianos, upright as well as horizontal, the wrest-pins
are contained entirely in a solid iron plate, a part of the usual iron fiame. The pins aie under peifect
control. They will carry any desired strain, for any length of time. Therefore frequent tuning is
unnecessary.
You see, then, how the Beale Pianos will endure for generations. We guarantee each and every one
for Twenty-five Years.
If you are interested, let us send you further particulars. There are many other points of superiority
about the Beale Australian Pianos. Our Catalogue is not only free, but we shall be pleased if you will ask

NOTIONS
Certain doubts as to whether crack Maorilander
Elevation will come to Sydney for the A.J.C. autumn
meeting have been settled by the solid manner in which
he has been backed lately. Some in the know were busy
two weeks ago gathering in Doncaster and Cup doubles,
coupling Elevation with anything thought to have a
chance in the big two-mile event; but great racehorse
though the champion of t’other side of the Tasman be,
this scribe won’t risk his bit on a 3-year-old with 9st. lib.
to carry in a race like the Doncaster. More than likely,
too, that at w.f. a. Mountain King, among the most bril-
liant colts Australia has known, will prove Elevation’s
master. Elevation has started in 20 races, and wor| nine,
been second six times, and third once ; and his haul in
prize money, so far, totals £3485.

The success of the ex-Maorilander, Maranui, in
the Rosehill Cup (Sydney) on Saturday was no surprise,
although he opened at 5 to 2 and started at 6 to 4. He
won like a machine, going away just when it was neces-
sary, and putting on just the speed required, and no
more. Some judges consider that, on his Rosehill run-
ning, he is not the man for Galw'ay or the horse for Don-
caster ; but, to the writer’s mind, he could have led the
field from start to finish had he desired, and, with 6st.
101 b. in the Doncaster and 6st. 71b. in the Cup, he will be
amongst the hardest of the nuts the winner will have to
crack. Even the double looks anything but impossible.
He is w'ell bred, being by Malatua (Malua—Faithful) from
G ratlin (Carbine— Loyal Peeress).
Rosehill Cup (Sydney) on Saturday last was
specially hung out to entice owners of nags engaged in
the big things of the coming A.J.C. autumn meeting,
and the prize was purposely fixed at £lOO, so that the
winner should incur no penalty. It had the additional
inducement of being a “ Tatt.’s ” sweep affair, and the
possibility of something to nothing proved an alluring
bait. No less than 71 nominated (thus contributing all
but £29 of the money offered), and then the fun began.
The drawing took place late in the week, and as hope
deferred made the hearts of owners gradually sick, the
dropping-out process began. By the day of the race 16
had withdrawn, for various reasons, and the information
board showed that another 42 dropped out at the last
moment. Only 13 started, and it is more than likely
that, owing to the late drawing, not one of them ran for
sweep cash. For once the sweep blackmailing trick doesn’t
seem to have worked.
* * * *
The yarn that got abroad just before the run-
ning of the Australian Cup, that Tartan had gone lame,
seems to have been another addition to the long list of
horse fairy tales. The nag’s preparation for A.J.C.
autumn meeting is going as smoothly as the most anxious
owner could desire.

Westralian Taxation Commissioners have ruled
that Patrick Moses is a “ resident trader,” and there is
weeping and wailing and lashing of curses. For the
decision means that Ikey O’Brien will , pay 2d. in the
pound till June and 4d. in the quid taxation afterwards
on takings. The beastly habit threatens to spread, and
the appearance of an ineome-tax officer taking notes
on Sydney suburban racecourses is causing an uneasy
feeling in the bosom with the diamondon.it.
One of the curiosities of British steeplechasing
is the frequency with which apparently hopeless cast-offs
land big prizes. Rubio, the latest Grand National win-
ner, ran in a hotel trap for part of his career. He was
bought as a hunter at one period for 95 guineas—a paltry
sum in a land where 300 guineas is not considered an out-
of-the-way price for a sound hunter. Grudon, a National
winner of a few years back, worked for a long time
in a milk cart, and was only rescued from that
walk of life by a fluke. (Bletsoe, who afterwards trained
him, thought he would make a quiet and comfortable hack,
and so bought him for about £B.) Grudon was not even
a thoroughbred (as Rubio is), but a rather heady-looking
“commoner.” It seems a dreadful reflection on the
“ figure system,” and other abstruse theories of scientific
breeding, when animals like these are able to win over the
five miles of enormous fences that decorate the National
course against the world’s most correctly bred jumpers.
* * * *
The prohibition of betting with women, under
the present Victorian Gambling Act, has provided all
kinds of disreputable characters with the price of beer
and the wages of iniquity. Some of these parasites make
a fairly good thing by obtaining bets for trusting females
—always on commission. In addition to the commission,
which in itself is more than moderate, the noxious
“ agent” usually helps himself to a substantial portion of
the” winnings, when there are any. These exac-
tions are, of course, the obvious penalties of vice
under difficulties; but the whole business has
its ludicrous side. What purports in this in-
stance to be a reforming measure has not checked the
operation of the gambling female—it has only tended to
fatten a class that is altogether parasitical. It is a class
that is useless and never works. It is law-evading. Its
haunts, records, and antecedents are, in most cases, un-
speakable. It is composed of “ fiz-gigs,” “whisperers,”
magsmen, spielers, “ guns”—indeed the very offal
of society. It adonis the landscape in and around
a quarter where a stranger takes risks at night, and
which is deeply suspected of concealing a full-blown and
lusty hazard school. In no sense can it be said to have
justified its existence. In truth, any self-respecting and
Spartan community would not be far wrong in hanging
95J per cent, of the creatures as a hint to the rest.

Lovely woman’s first Melbourne appearance,
this season, in an athletic arena, transpired on Richmond
City Oval, on March 25. The occasion was a meeting of
the Vic. Cycle Sports Association, and sundry scraggy -
looking youths, among whom were a one-armed cyclist
and a Jap, slopped round the track a few times for prizes
of from ss. to 50s. The spectacle of a camera fiend
laboriously snap-shotting' the winner of a 50s. prize was
humorous. The ladies mentioned were Mrs. Myra
Palmer, of Brummagem, and Miss 0. A. Dixon, of Mel-
bourne. Miss Dixon was garbed in an ordinary
lady’s cycling costume of navy blue, also she wore her own
flaxen hair, gossamer, and a suspicion of pearl powder.
Mrs. Palmer, who won by a wheel, was reminiscent of
Alioe Barnett in “ lolanthe.” Under the Pure Food Act
the lady would be labelled as “ not containing less than
14 stone,” but she could handle her bike nicely. In a
neat cap, a short grey jacket, grey knickers and black
stockings, she treated the 300 spectators to a view of a
well-furnished pair of calves and a generously-rounded
figure. One almost wished to see her fall—she would
have bounced so beautifully. Altogether, Mrs. Palmer
was a pleasing circumstance.

Ashfield (Sydney) Bicycle Club will send a
team to the Warrriambool-Melbourne road-race in Novem-
ber and one of the body, W. Whitby, will attempt to set
up a new record between Melbourne and Sydney. As he
is to be paced throughout by a motor-bike, and Salvana
has announced his intention of using the same accessory,
apparently both gentlemen recognise that Pearson’s
record of 57hr. 24min. on an ordinary push bicycle is a
tough article, and think it isn’t worth while trying to
smash it. When Pearson returned from Melbourne he
seemed none the worse for his effort, and also quite
oblivious of the fact that he had done something alto-
gether out of the ordinary. Which beaming modesty is the
hall-mark of the real, born, dyed-in-the-wool champion.

MacFarland and A. J. Clark appeared suddenly
in Sydney last week, and staggered local wheelers with the
information that they were off to Salt Lake City in the
morning. After a few hours spent in tea-rooms and bun-
shops, they started for Newcastle, where they caught the
outgoing steamer Yeddo. As the boat had but few
passengers, MacFarland and Clark hope to be able to do
bike practice on deck. In Salt Lake City they will meet
Ivor Lawson, Frank Kramer, and the resurrected Major
Taylor. That is, if Kramer cannot be induced to stay in
Europe. Lawson and Taylor are already on the track,
and on February Bth bad a match, which was fought out
with unusual determination and bitterness. They have
been enemies for years. It will be remembered that Law-
son incurred a penalty here some years ago for bustling
the black, although when Taylor got “ de Loard” to
take His foot off the pedal, he could rip out an
opponent’s spokes with the best of them, as Floyd
MacFarland found to his cost on Sydney Cricket Ground
track. Their last race at Salt Lake was a best-of-tbree
affair. Lawson won the first heat by a foot, and Taylor
got in a whirlwind finish at the end of the second, which
landed him home first by the same distance. In the third
Taylor bumped Lawson out of the road, and won easily,
but the heat was ordered to be re-run, and the winded
Taylor was beaten by a length. A humorous feature of
the race was an attempt to reconcile the two riders, and
in response to roars from the crowd, they shook hands.
In Yankeeland it is dangerous to be unfriendly when the
audience orders a sport to be reconciled. So Lawson and
his black brudder reconciled accordingly.

The Federal Cycling Council of the Australasian
Leagues of Wheelman (what a fearful title !) will he held
in Melbourne on the 29th of next month. N.S.W. will be
represented bv H. D. Mclntosh, better known in bike
circles as “Fighting Mac.” There is nothing very
startling happening in the world of wheel as far
as Australia is concerned, excepting that in Vic-
toria the unregistered rider is playing the devil with
the League. When the N.S.W. League was torn by in-
ternal dissension, Victoria gave very lukewarm support
even on paper, and in practice was distinctly hostile. Now
it’s in a considerable hole itself. In South Australia the
League gave up the ghost some two years ago, and dur-
ing the interval a new body has come into existence and
secured control of the sport. One of the first actions of
the Federal Council will be to legalise the new governing
body of S.A.
The detailed account of the doings of that battle
motor-car in Morocco will make interesting reading, for
there is little doubt that the battles of the future will be
scattered engagements, fought between roving squadrons
of motor-cars—that is to say, until the Flying Homicide
is working. Genty, the Frenchman in charge of the
Panhard gun car in Morocco, seems to have handled his
machine pretty well, for the authorities have decorated his
manlv buzzum with the Cross of the Legion of Honor.
But it is one thing to mow down savages armed with more
or less unreliable rifles, and another to tackle a similar
motor-car encased in armor and fitted with guns of pre-
cision. A pitched battle between forces composed of
several thousand motor-cars would be a fine sight, and it
is a wonder that some cinematograph fiend has not faked
one already.
* • * *
The New York to Paris motor race has already
degenerated into a farce. The leading car, a Yankee
creation named the Thomas, had travelled only 921 miles
in 10 days ; the de Dion was laid up on the road “ await-
ing the arrival of fresh parts from Chicago,” and the
8-h.p. Sizaire-Naudin (fancy racing round the world in a
little 8-h.p. car !) had been bailed up by an ordinary snow-
storm. In fact, all the cars were bailed up at one time
or another by ordinary snow-drifts, and had to shovel a
way through. Shovelling a track through a Yankee
snow-drift is hard work, but just consider the sort of
task the racers will have when it comes to shovelling a
road through a chain of icebergs while running along the
fringe of the Arctic Ocean off the Asian coast.
Also, think of awaiting the arrival of new parts
from Chicago in the middle of Behring Strait.
The completion of the race is to be the signal
for another daring enterprise, in the shape of a motor-
boat race across the Atlantic from Havre to New York.
The promoters are a firm of Italian motor-boat makers.
If the event comes off —and it is much more possible than
the round-the-world car contest—it should provide some
thrilling copy.

What “standardisation” means. The Cadillac
Co., makers of motor cars, has requested the British
Automobile Club to select any three single-cylinder cars
from its stock, take them to Brooklands track, dismember
and mix all the parts together in a heap. Out of the
medley three fresh machines are to be constructed, and
they are to start immediately after completion for a 500-
mile trial run.
* * « *
Looks as though the race for the Albert Cup,
which carries with it the motor-boat championship of
Port Jackson (N.S W.), will this season be a very one-
boat show. So far, the alleged Whatmore hydroplane has
not entered, and it looks as though the Fairbanks will have
a walk over. A more interesting affair will be the ocean
race, to be held some time in May, from a mark in Sydney
Harbor, round another in Broken Bay back to the start-
ing point, a distance of, roughly, 45 odd miles. The
ocean-going cruisers have been increasing like rabbits of
late, and the entry promises to be large—almost huge.
Relph’s Invincible is an almost certain starter, and some
fine racing is sure to ensue.

Maoriland has suddenly become the hub of the
sculling universe. Webb had hardly beaten Tresidder
when he was challenged by Dick Arnst, and before he
had time to write a reply, Whelch, of Akaroa (Canter-
bury), was also after him. But winter has fallen on Maori-
land suddenly this year, and there is no chance of either
of them being accommodated till next summer.
• * * *
Thoroughgood’s claim to the sculling champion-
ship of Australia brought Fogwell at his throat immedi-
ately, and all that seems to stand between a match for
the honor and £lOO a side is the selection of a course.
Fogwell wants either the Richmond River or the Parra-
matta, with a preference for the latter, while Thorough-
good sticks to the Hunter at Raymond Terrace. And at
time of writing the affair was (like the strike that isn’t)
still undecided.
* * * *
Said that Tresidder had intended to remain in
Maoriland till he read some interviews in Sydney papers,
in which some brother rowers made use of his name very
freely. And when he had absorbed, learned and inwardly
digested the things that had been said about him, he
started on his homeward journey tor t he express P P

There is no doubt the system of the Football
League in England levels up play, and makes every club
match desperftely exciting At the end of each season,
the lowesttwo of the 20clubs in the First Division go dow n
into the Second, the top two of the S^ on t d h^f ’"/never a
tioninto their places. Consequently, there is never a
ready weak team in the First. When the last mail left,
quite eight clubs of the 20 were within the danger zone a
margin of three points covering the lot. .(A win counts
two points and a drawn game one.) Twosignificantfaets
show the closeness of the long strugg e-winch lasts eight
months of every year. The lowwt club on the list con
sidered almost hopelessly doomed to go dow n had
record no worse than nine games won, 15 lost, three
drawn—2l points; and, at the other end of the table,
only three clubs of the 20 had been able to get 30 points
or over in the 27 matches played. #
The Rugby League burst suddenly on the pub-
lic sight last Saturday, by playing two matches at Rose-
bery Park Racecourse. Eastern Suburbs and South Syd-
ney made a draw, and Glebe downed Newtown by three
to nil. The matches advertised for next Saturday are
Newtown v. Western Suburbs and North Sydney v. Glebe,
both at Rosebery Park ; Balmain v. Balmain •Jun'ors. at
Bircligrove ; and Eastern Suburbs I. and 11. v.i South Syd-
ney I. and 11., place of meeting not mentioned. It is the
lack of grounds that is going to kill the League stone
dead. Rosebery Park is a long way from the centres of
population, and people will not pay railway fares to see a
football match as they will to watch a horse-race-not
even if the great Messenger himself is playing. Unless
the League can get some grounds closer to the city, it
is done.
The fact that summer is fading is brought home
by the violent meetings of footballers, and, judging by
the tone of some of the gatherings, the gods of winter are
in a bellicose mood, and the season threatens to open
under stormy conditions. Another sign of dying summer
is the appearance of the lacrosse men, who are already in
the field with practice matches. Mention of lacrosse re-
calls the fact that the captain of the crowd of Canadian
toughs who recently toured Australia has been telling his
countrymen that the Australians don t know the rudi-
ments of the game. But, considering that he also told
them that all the Australian railways run along the sea-
coast, the Australian ’erosser will probably survive the
statement. #
Summer is pegging out its allotment in the
graveyard. Yachting is over, the last kick being the
Royal Yacht Squadron’s races for tuck boats and sailing
skiffs on Sydney Harbor on Saturday last. No one took
any interest in the contest of the shells, and all eyes were
centred on the Commodore’s boat for the signal Come
aboard ! ” Then the real business of the afternoon was
entered upon and carried through to a most successful
conclusion, though there was a temporary hitch through
the corkscrew wearing out. Open-boat sailing is also
breathing its last lingering breath, and on Saturday' after-
noon Sydney Club sailed its final 18ft. handicap. Thirteen
started, and in the breathless Indian summer afternoon
the Australian, steered by Christian Webb, drifted home
with a margin of 2min. 46sec., with Zena, Maritana and
Gladwyn behind in that order. #
A Sydney sporting scribe deplores that no
effort has been made to raise funds to send runner Nigel
Barker and swimmer Cecil Healy to represent Australia
at the Olympian Games in England, “because both are
now at the top of their form.” The same thing was said
when they were sent to Athens by public subscription,
but apparently their form fell overboard during the
journey, as neither succeeded at the Games. Later on
Cecil did distinguish himself on the continent and
in England, but Barker failed badly. It’s odds
on that Daniels would beat Healy at his own
game, sprinting; and there is nothing to indicate that
Barker would do any better than he did at Athens. The
chances are that the opposition will be more numerous
and of higher quality. Anyhow, if men are to be sent
to represent Australia the thing should be properly
organised. The men should be sent under proper
management, and should arrive in the Cold Country in
sufficient time to give them a chance to get somewhat
acclimatised. This collection of a few pounds and the
despatch of a few individuals instead of a proper team is
not likely to do Australia any good. If the country is
too tired, or too indifferent, to “ do the thing properly,” as
Mr. Jenkins said, the thing is better left alone.

Victorian 10-miles champion ped Victor Aitken,
the second fiddle to Geo. Blake for the English Marathon
race in July next, hoofed over 21£ miles on Satur-
day last. The road negotiated was from Beveridge to
Brunswick. Aitken, accompanied by another scantily-
clad ped and a motor car, left Beveridge at 2.45 p.m., and
along a steady up-grade with a strong side wind, put five
miles behind in 30imin., which is pretty swift going.
Assisted by harriers, who dropped in as pace and a
breakwind, Aitken careered over the “ macadamised ”
with effortless ease, and put 10 miles away in 62min.
15secs., which is the time a Cabbage State championship
has been won in. The next five miles also went by in fine
time, and his going per mile for “ fifteen ” panned out a
sound 6min. 21secs. From 10 miles onward the
champion began to wear a worried look, his shoulders
to graft, and his stride to shorten. At Campbell-
field, reached at 4.22 p.m., efforts were made to liven
his pace, but without avail. From 19 miles to
the finish he hung out distress signals, but didn’t
pause, and the feet still pattered along. At Brunswick
the brickmakers filled the toepaths ; they even left their
long pints, and enthusiasm fairly bubbled. Nearing the
cricket reserve, where the 21£ miles ceased, Aitken
faltered often, but gamely kept jigging, and though
he was palpably blown, he finished up in 2 hours 26min.
26secs. without a spell. Though 16£ miles were dis-
tinctly down-grade running, yet, given all that in, the
youngster gave a meritorious display. However, he
was in no fit state to amble a yard further. As
regards stamina, George Blake is a peer amongst Aus-
tralian distance running athletes, and Saturday’s display
is sound evidence in support of the seasoned athlete.
Aitken is merely 21 next May, so his anatomy has yet to
undergo a settling-down process. With age and experi-
ence, he should prove a tough nut to crack on any side of
the planet, but at present he’s a second fiddle. The full
journey would see him compelled to quit.

There was no first grade cricket in Sydney on
Saturday. The round that should have started the
previous week end and finished on Saturday was broken
up bv the irruption of the Noble Testimonial Match, so on
Saturday last cricketers took a well-earned rest. Every-
body is getting a little tired xOf cricket. Its lack of
originality is wearying.

Melbourne Pennant Cricket last Saturday pro-
vided some joy for tired spectators at “ North” cricket
ground. The persons dealing out the amusement were
Warne and Collins, of Carlton, who, during the whole
afternoon, smote the local bowling with bat and con-
tumely. At the end of the day’s play, the result of their
easy indifference to the ball was 292 for one wicket, Delves
having gone out previously for 31. Warne and Collins are
at present 154 and 100 not out respectively, with a chance
of supplying additional entertainment at the resumption
of the game on Wednesday, which, from this
paper’s point of view, was, of course, yesterdav
Melbourne against Fitzroy increased its total to
416 for five wickets, declared its innings closed
and just failed to lick ’Hoy on the first innings, that team
being 144 for nine wickets at six o clock. Fast’s little
trouble with University was no trouble at all. To
’Varsity’s 267, the premier club responded with 272 for
six wickets, thus winning by four wickets on the fim
innings. Stuckey (90) and Scott (83 not out) were East’s
boss offenders with the bat. St. Hilda defeated North-
cote by 146 runs, mainly due to the erectness of its
caudal appendage. And of the erectness thereof
Ainslie (61) and Kirwan (78 not out) were accused
and found guilty. The other disturbances, or rather
gentle agitations, were placid batting exhibitions
Oollingwood suppressed Richmond by 82 runs, and
South did likewise for P’ran with a margin of 59
With the ball on Saturday, Vernon for South took
five for 21 ; while, next to him, came that consistent
artist, Fry, of Oollingwood, who gathered in six for 49
At times The BullktiN has had occasion to mention Mr
Fry- He seems to be an eminently useful citizen, and, if
figures are any criterion, he should get a trial in first-class
company next season. #
Wrestler Clarence Weber was right up against
it when he encountered Peter Bannon, a recent British
importation, at the Melbourne Athletic Club, t’other
Monday night. Weber presented some 14 stone of cultured
muscle against Bannon’s list. 3slbs., and despite the
local athlete’s weight and strength advantage the importa-
tion was a well-supported candidate. Peter, totally out
of form, proved a snag to old Buttan Singh, in the afore-
said hall some time back ; hence the support. Clartnce
went strong from the jump. His effort was a cross-
buttock, but Bannon met it with a calculated couhter
that gave him immediate command from behind. Every
subsequent attempt of Weber’s to secure a buttock
failed—in fact almost every hold he applied was frustrated
with ease and confidence. Bannon turned apparent
defeat into winning situations, and the weightier man was
unmistakably puzzled. However, despite the Briton's
skill, Weber’s weight, strength and agility told. Securing
the commanding position on the mat, he obtained a
quarter Nelson, and gradually strengthened it to a half
Nelson, followed by a “full,” which turned the shifty
Bannon on his two shoulders in 17min. 26£sec. After
lOmin. spell the struggle resumed. Weber wanted another
fall to win, and Peter didn’t want to get left. The men
wrestled out time without a further fall being registered,
but the struggle never waned, and interest was at high
pressure from gong to gong. Weber secured his best
hold—a full Nelson—time and again, but the eel-like
Bannon broke away with remarkable strength and agility.
At 27£min. Bannon had “Clary” in difficulties on the
mat with a waist and arm hold, assisted by the
knee, but the youthful athlete got out smartly.
During the last minute of the time limit
Bannon bogged in like a fiend, but without
avail. Referee Beckett declared Weber the winner.: It
was a clear case of weight and strength defeating sciehce,
but, with a leaf from Bannon’s book, it is obvious (hat
Weber would take a lot of beating by anything in the
game. Bannon is the cleverest man of his hands seen
hereabouts of late years, not omitting the mighty Hack-
enschmidt—who, by the way, never displayed any remark-
able skill in Australia at all events.

A most terrible thing is the way these Amurkan
boxers fight one another with their mouths for months
before getting down to business. Burns recently offered
to smash Johnson in England, provided he could have a
16ft. ring, so that he could pound the black’s ribs right
in, and his stuffing right out. Johnson replied with a
snort that Noah Thomas could have the 16ft. ring, padlock
it, and throw the key away. What would happen to
Burns he refrained from saying—probably out of mercy
for the reporters. And even with this cordial agreement
and beautiful unanimity the fight seems no nearer.

The decline of boxing in Australia was brought
home vividly last week when the Exhibition Building
committee, which was promoting a pug. carnival under
the management of Larry Foley. shelved the idea. Only
two entries were received, which the management con-
sidered would be a fair return for the entrance, money.
So boxing in the Exhibition building is off till next
summer, when it is hoped Tommy Burns and other foreign
star-bruisers will be on view. The inducement was
liberal, but the talent was not available.

With its V-shaped paddock 0f146 acres at Oak-
leigh, the Caulfield Golf Club promises to take the shine
out of the Melbourne Club’s links at Sandringham.
Having got the ti-tree roots harrowed out and the ground
levelled, it has had the course with couch-
grass. Also three big windmills and six 5000 gal. tanks
have been put up, three wells sunk, and nearly two miles
of 2in. piping laid along the track where the go fers ton
and the caddies play. The late Jas. McCulloch s hriek
villa has had another storey added, and will presently he
the dandiest of club houses, with its billiard-rooms, bath-
rooms, boudoirs and bar. Alongside are tennis, croquet
and bowling greens —of Hinglish grass, of course ; part o
the £l6O worth of seed imported from the Cold Country.
But, withal, there is a fly in the spikenard. Just across
the road at the south end of the links are the effluvious
bone-mills of Dale and Fitzgerald, and when the b. ana
B.W. winds blow, cleeks and foursomes are a weariness or
the flesh. Meanwhile, the management committee or
Albert Park is thinking of following the example or
London County Council, Bournemouth and sundry scot-
tish councils in establishing public links where Wllna
the Bloke and his Lizzie may disport themselves. ™
the lake on one side and a score of football matches p •
ceeding on the other, golf in Albert Park would be an e
citing occupation.

HORSE ITEM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At the beginning of a case to-day somewhat of a sensa-
tion was created amongst the solicitors in court by a re-
quest by the Judge to the clerk of courts to intimate to
a solicitor, who was about to open a case without being
attired in wig and gown, that he would not permit any
such departure from the usual practice. The solicitor
thereupon attired himself in accordance with the wish of
the Judge.— News Item.
The horse is an elegant beast when he’s fed,
And there’s plenty of fodder and grass ;
He has plenty of hair on his tail and his head,
And he hasn’t the bray of an ass.
He works for his chaff in a ’bus or a dray,
Now and then falling down on his knees ;
And he’ll gallop or walk, but he never will talk :
And he’ll work just as long as you please.
For a handful of hay he will sweat all the day,
And demand nothing extra in fees.
The Judge and the barrister argue for years,
And each one in his wig is quite lost ;
The litigant listens and sheds bitter tears,
For he’s counting the terrible cost;
Then he looks at the stuff each one has on his poll,
And he feels a sharp pang of remorse,
For, altho’ they have there quite a lot of the hair,
They have not got the sense of the horse.
No, they haven’t indeed ! Not the sense or the speed,
They have only the Hair of The Horse 1

DEAFNESS
Deafness, Head-Noises, Ringing in the Ears, or
any other Aural Complication completely cured
at your own Home with Pure
AURAL KINETICS.
Do not be blasting your head or destroying your Ears
entirely, by probing, or by spraying with dangerous drugs.
Remember no cases of deafness, or any affliction of the
internal ear, can be satisfactorily cured with medicine or
electricity.
PROP. OSBORNE in his annual lecture before the
Medical Society said “ The Medical, Electrical or even
Surgical system of coping with the disease of the auditory
nerve is a scientific murder .” The eminent PROF.
EMMETT said: —“ The science of medicine with the
delicate mechanism of the internal ear was founded t
upon congestion and improved by murder."
Is it then a wonder that this new discovery has created
such a sensation in the scientific world? It does not con-
sist of any Drugs or Electricity, but simply Pure Natural
Aural Kinetics, applied by yourself right at your own
home without the necessity of a physician, and without
any interference to your daily routine work.
It makes no difference what ear troubles you suffer from, or of how long standing your case may be.
Many who have been deaf for years have been quite restored—brought back to the full enjoyment of life by
the means of this great discovery.
L<
DAVID LINDSAY, Esq., of 137 VICTORIA STREET, DARLINGHURST (N.S.W.), was
troubled with deafness and other serious aural complications. Doctors said “no hope.” Mr.
Lindsay wrote :—“ It is only a question of time when I shall be stone deaf, as the doctors
told me I will never be cured.” To-day Mr. Lindsay is a healthy man, enjoying acute hearing,
and the disagreeable noises have all ceased. The “ EAROCOPE ” did it in a very short time.
In consequence of which Mr. Lindsay writes “ The ‘ Earoscope ”is certainly a wonderful
treatment. I never expected to be cured, and it was indeed a happy surprise after so many
years of suffering. I thank you heartily for the good you have done me, as you have made a
new man out of me entirely.”
We will gladly tell you all about this great boon to humanity, and will be pleased to forward our booklet
with abundant testimonials, FREE OF CHARGE, on receipt of your name and address.

EIGHT YEARS SUFFERING
A PERMANENT CURE.
THE CASE OF MRS. A. WEAVER.
BY A SYDNEY REPORTER.
No one can tell the self-denying work which
good men have done in the early days of this
country, neither can we exaggerate the nobleness
of spirit which animates present-day people in a
desire to ameliorate distress as much as lies in their
power. Therefore, the public should be informed
of some of these efforts, one of which was made by
Mrs. Alice Weaver, of No. 7 Louis Street, Redfern,
who replied to the reporter by saying :
“ About this time last year I was living in
Telopea Street, and it was just before I left there
for this place that I was fortunate in casting aside
a complaint that had worried me for no less than
eight years. What a fearful life of suffering mine
had been all that time, to be sure, and to think that
nothing in the world could benefit me made my
spirits droop lower than they will ever be again,
I hope.”
“What made you think that nothing could
benefit you ? ” queried the writer.
“I arrived at that conclusion because nothing
had done me good so far, and I believe I tried
every medicine going. At the time my second
child was born I was under a doctor, who did
everything he could for me, but still my health re-
mained as bad as it could be. Indeed, at that
period I was nearly dead with indigestion, al-
though I dieted myself and did all that could be
done to keep my torments in check. It was of no
avail, though, for when I ate anything I could
hardly breathe owing to a feeling which came like
a lump in my chest, from which place a sharp pain
went right through to the centre of my shoulders.
I then remained in the utmost agony until the food
was vomited up again, after which I felt so ex-
hausted that I could not think of doing a thing in
the house until I had had a good rest. It would
Burpriseyouifyou only knew how poor my appetite
was. You would wonder how anyone could keep
alive with it, and as for my head, oh, my sufferings
with it were awful. The most piercing pains at
onetime, and themost depressingachesat another.
Really, I think it was a marvel how I kept my
senses with the agony I endured in the head ; and
it’s strange that I did not meet with many a nasty
accident through the giddiness which used to over-
take me. I was a misery to myself and everybody
around me, and to tell you the honest truth I never
thought I would live through it all. My eves used
to feel heavy enough to drop out of their sockets,
and I was affected in the mouth by such a bitter
taste that it made me feel sick of a morning, after
putting in the usual restless nights that had done
much towards making a wreck of me. Even in the
daytime Iwasalwaysimagining something terrible
was going to happen, and these were just the very
things that Clements Tonic, which I commenced to
take, showed itself to be the master of ; for it sent
such a vigor through my frame, when I had been
taking it a couple of weeks, that I could not kelp
feeling joyful in the belief that at last my health
had taken a beneficial turn. I got more Clements
Tonic, and as each bottle was finished, so did my
prospects improve, for I commenced to take my
meals with a degree of heartiness which astonished
my people as much as it pleased them ; and to my
own satisfaction anddelight theformer discomforts
attending my meals were quickly out of existence.
Oh, dear, what a changed woman I am now to then.
Mv limbs do not ache from weakness like they
formerly did, and I can go about my work as
cheerfully and as actively as any housewife in the
country. Ido not spend any restless nights now;
never dream during my sleep, and the pains that
used to abound have long since been driven away
from every part of my body. Well, Clements
Tonic made me the healthy woman I am, and tor
the sake of other sufferers I trust you ll publish
this interview in any way you think fit.

Dugald Thomson, M.H.R., fell in the
other day in the Reps. He rose to criticise an
item in the Estimates—£loo expenses of Honorary
Ministers. Although the item comprised expenses
for a whole twelve months, Dugald viewed it with
great disapproval. He inferred that this tendency
to increase expenditure was dangerous in practice
and would lead to the “bust-up” of the Con-
stitution, or something. And, just after he had
objected to the principle of paying such expenses
out of the consolidated revenue, Mahon (W.A.)
reminded him that he (Dugald) had been a
member of Half-Premier Reid’s Ministry, which
had charged up on the Estimates a matter of £l9
for entertaining the captain of a visiting French
vessel. Thereupon, a partially-collapsed Dugald
inquired if it was not the practice of the present
Ministry to charge the cost of official dinners up
on the Estimates. He was told that it was not,
and, except in the case of the Ministry that he
had adorned, it never had been. Then a wholly-
collapsed Dugald felt sorry that he had opened his
mouth.
N.S.W. State Commandant General Gordon
is responsible for the sensible suggestion that the
proposed Commonwealth arsenal site at Lithgow
should be made into a “ model village” by the
Australian Government. But it may be counted
wise in the future to move thearsenal to the Federal
capital. Certainly wherever the Commonwealth
establishes a Government industry it should re-
serve enough land for the d wellings of the resulting
population, so that no land monopolist should
harvest a crop of unearned increment.

“Gum-Leaf” : My weekly wash-lady is a
voluble lady, and last Monday she told me this
tale of woe
Oh yes, m’m, I know all about the person that wants
me to do 'er washin’. A gentleman friend of mine—’e
carts soil—l met ’im on th’ road, an’ ’e give me the news.
Yer see, it’s this way, m’m, I can’t see me way clear to do
it f’r ’er, because jest at present I’m doin’ the work of a
lady friend of mine ’oos got very coarse veins, an’ they’ve
bu’sted on’er. Yer know, m’m, me ole man’s been laid
up with a bad leg this good w’ile, an’ on Saterdivs I
alwus gits ’im a paper on me way ’ome. Larst Sater-
diy there wus a feller standin’ alongside er a
pile er papers on the worf. I sez ter ’im, “ I’ll
take a paper” (I thought ’e was sellin’ them). ’E
turns round an’ ’e sez ter me, ’e sez, “ Take as many as
yer bloomin’ well please. It’s nothin’ ter do with me.
I’ve been waitin’ ’ere over ’arf an hour fer that dam girl
to bring back the change out of sixpence, an’ yer the sixth
that’s, told me yer goin’ ter take a paper. Do wot yer
dam well like with the ole dam lot.” An’ he warked off
lookin’ as if ’e’d like ter cut me throat. I’m glad the color
of yer clo’es suits yer. I’ve 'ad lots er complaints that
me washin’s tip-top.

BRONCHITIS
I
The Famous Remedy For
Coughs, Bronchitis, Pneumonia,
Pleurisy, Asthma & Consumption
BRONCHITIS and PNEUMONIA
Cured by
HEARNE’B BRONCHITIS CURE
After other Treatment had Failed.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —From a strict sense
of duty I feel that I should publish the following state-
ment, so that others may know what to do when the
awful fact is evident that a life is in danger of being
lost: —In September, 1906, my little girl, aged at that
time 3 years, contracted Measles, and in the following
October was attacked by Bronchitis, Pneumonia and
Congestion of the Lungs. She was attended by a
legally qualified doctor of high standing, but his treat-
ment was not successful in arresting the progress of the
illness. On Saturday, the 21st October, 1906, he said
that her life was in danger—that there was very little
hope for her. For eight days and nights she had been
prostrated by Cough, Pain and Fever, and was lying
like a statue, unconscious. At this stage I was per-
suaded by a friend to obtain Hearne s Bronchitis Cure,
with its auxiliary medicine for the Fever and Conges-
tion of the Lungs, as directed in the Catalogue of
Medicines which accompanies each bottle of the Bron-
chitis Cure. I gave the medicine as directed, and there
was an improvement from the first dose of Hearne s
Bronchitis Cure. The improvement continued after
each dose of the medicine. In a week she was perfectly
free from the Pneumonia, Congestion, Cough, Pam and
Fever, and was well, except that she was still weak. In
a fortnight she was o.uite recovered, and is now in
splendid health, and stronger than ever. Any person
asking for information about this grand medicine can
be supplied by me, or by any of my neighbours who have
witnessed its wonderful effects. It absolutely snatched
my child from an early grave. —Yours gratefully,
D. GAKDIInLK,
Police Station, Geelong East, Feb. 5, 1908.

A Sufferer 73 Years of Age.
Thoroughly CureC by Two Bottles of

Immediate Relief Effect Wonderful.
Mr. Hearne Sir, —I was very ill with Influenza
and Bronchitis. A friend of mine persuaded me to try
your Bronchitis Cure. The first dose gave me imme-
diate relief, and after taking the second bottle I am
thoroughly cured. Its effect on me has been most
wonderful. lam 73 years of age. I trust you will
make use of this statement by publishing it for the bene-

PNEUMONIA and PLEURISY
cured by
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE
After other Treatment had Failed.
I, Prudence M‘Kee, of Carr-street, South Geelong, in
view of the importance of a person making it quite clear
what treatment was successful in curing a serious and
complicated case when the medicine, directions and treat-
ment of a legally qualified doctor had failed, state as
follows: — , , , ,
My son, Henry M‘Kee, then aged 8 years, had been
attended by a legally qualified doctor, who pronounced
him to be suffering from Pneumonia, Pleurisy and a
stoppage of the passing of Urine. Under the doctor’s
treatment the child gradually got worse, and the doctor
pronounced the case hopeless. He told me that the
child could not live. At this stage I obtained from
Mr. W. G. Hearne, Chemist, of Geelong, a bottle of
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and gave it to the child, ac-
cording to the directions which accompany each bottle
of it. The child improved after the second dose of
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure. He continued to improve
each day from each dose of Hearne’s Medicine alone, and
within three days he was free from the Cough, Pneu-
monia and the Pleurisy, and the Urine was passing satis-
factorily. He was out of bed at the end of a week,
completely recovered, and he is now in perfect health.

Carr-street, South Geelong, Feb. 6, 1908.
CONSUMPTION.
Too 111 to Leave His Bed.
A Complete Cure.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.
Dear Sir, —I am writing to tell you about the wonder-
ful cure your medicine has effected in my case. About
three years ago I began to cough. At first the cough
was not severe, but it gradually got worse, and I became
very weak and troubled with night sweats, pain in my
chest, and great quantities of phlegm. On several oc-
casions there was blood in the expectorated matter. 1
had been treated by a doctor who pronounced my case to
be consumption, and various other treatments had been
tried but without benefit. It was at this stage that
heard of your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for a
course of the medicine. When it arrived 1 at w “ !. °‘d
to leave my bed, but I commenced taking it at once, and
gradually improved. lam glad to say that the two
lots of medicine you sent have effected a complete cure,
for which accept my very best thanks.— Yours gratefully,
Westminster Bridge-road, S.E., London.
BRONCHITIS and PLEURISY.
A Bevere Case Cured by Two Bottles of
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
After Other Treatment had Failed.
Mr. Hearne, Chemist, Geelong.
Dear Sir, —Some months ago, in Sydney, I suffered
from a severe attack of influenza, and was confined to
my room for. about a week, at the end of which time,
feeling somewhat better, I got up and tried to transact
my business as usual. But I got up too soon, for the
very next day I had a relapse, and suffered tortures from
what the doctor ,told me was pleurisy and bronchitis.
The pain from tjre former in my chest and shoulders
was frightful, and for four long weeks I was confined to
my bed under the care of a well-known Sydney doctor,
and all the time his medicine gave me but temporary
relief. The landlady of the hotel (the Cleveland), where
I resided, told me of a medicine—Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure —from Victoria, which had cured her of a bad at-
tack of bronchitis and pains in the chest, and begged
of me to try it. I did so, and, in thanks and gratitude
to you, tell you that, after the second bottle, my cough
had ceased; but what is more astonishing, the pains from
pleurisy entirely Ifeft me, and in about a week I was able
to attend to my duties as usual.—Yours faithfully,
J. BRAHAM.

ASTHMA—A 17 YEARS CASE.
Previous Treatment Failed.
Cured by Three Bottles,
Mr. Alex. J. Anderson, of Oak Park, Charleville,
Queensland, wrote After suffering from asthma for
seventeen years, and having been under a great many
different treatments without benefit, I was induced to try
Hearne’s Medicine for Asthma. After taking three
bottles of this medicine I quite got rid of the asthma,
and since then, which was the beginning of 1883—fifteen
years ago—l have not had the slightest return of it.
The medicine quite cured me, and I have much pleasure
in recommending it.”
Speaking in February, 1908, he states: — lam keeping
very well. Never have the slightest return of the asthma.
“ Hearne’s Medicine cured me of Asthma, from which
I had been suffering for twenty-five years, during which
time I had used almost every patent medicine on the
market —including asthma inhalations—without getting a
cure. It was 8 years ago that the cure was effected
by Hearne’s Medicine, and I now feel stronger than I
have felt for years—in fact. I feel splendid.”

PERFECTLY CURED
BY CUTICURA REMEDIES
“I have much pleasure in letting you
know of the remarkable cure of my
daughter of eczema. It was the worst
case I had ever seen. To see her neck
was a sickening spectacle, as you could
see nothing but sores. We tried differ-
ent kinds of ointments, but to no effect.
We also had her under the care of two
doctors for several weeks, and they gave
Us ointments and powders and ordered
us to take off her ordinary clothes and
keep on her night dresses, but to no
avail, for where we applied the doctor’s
ointment it broke out worse. At last
we gave up the medical men and tried
a box of Cuticura Ointment, and after
using part of same we could see a differ-
ence, so we persevered with three more
boxes of Cuticura Ointment. She was
perfectly cured. Since then we have
used Cuticura Soap and she has now a
nice clean skin. P. Crowther, 62, Chell

HAPPY, HEALTHY CHILDREN
fill the home with sunshine. When they become fretful
and out of sorts, it is generally because a mild laxative
is required-not a purgative mind ! Nothing is so truly
beneficial in such cases as a dose of California Syrup of
Fies which the little ones accept eagerly for its delicious
flavour- and it causes no discomfort: just relieves and
corrects gently, naturally, comfortingly, overcoming the
tendency to constipation. For its perfect purity and
harmlessness, as well as for its truly beneficial effects,
it is cordially endorsed by the medical profession.

“S.S.” : It was at a Melbourne novice boxing
tournament, and there had been much slather and whack,
when Peters and Whybrow entered the ring'. Peters was
perhaps 11 stone; Whybrow was certainly 14, and a
sewer-sinker of cart-horse make and shape to boot.
There was a yell as the two clutched hands, and the
crowd clamored for weights. The referee came forward.
“ This is catch weights,” he said. “ Peters is fighting a
bye.” Up jumped a little red-eyed, fighting Irishman in
the front seats. “ Fightin’ a bye !” he yelled. “ A bye !
H—-11! If that’s a bye, how big is a mahn ? ”

Hitherto the world’s boss bicycle tracks have
been those of Munich, Germany, and Parc des Princes in
Paris. Both are 726yds. to the lap, and the German
track has carried a paced-bike speed of 59 miles 86yds.
per hour, put up by P. Guignard ; while the Parisian one
has gone one better with 63 miles 1078yds. per hour,
made by motor-cyclist J. Guippone. Now England gomes
along with a new speedway which is calculated to throw
both of them in the shade. The new creation will appear
in the Shepherd’s Bush Stadium, where the Olympians
will compete. The dimensions are 2§ laps to the mile,
or a circumference of 660yds., with 35ft. on the straights,
and 27ft. on the banked corners, which will range up to
9ft. The surface will be of the finest cement on a con-
crete foundation, and it is estimated to carry a speed of
60 to 75 miles per hour. It is forecasted that at the
Olympian Games sixty miles will be covered in 60
minutes on a push bike, behind pace, on the new track.

“Jean Sibi,” from Melbourne : We rather pride
ourselves on being a cricket-loving community, and pro-
I duce scores of demented enthusiasts quite easily during a
Test match—enthusiasts who are of quite as much
benefit to sport generally as, say, the fisherman
who spreads his net, or the ferocious pursuer of
stamps. Yet when the Test has clomb into the darkness
of forgotten things, the cricket-loving community be-
comes the decimal of a suspicion. For instance, you can
trot around to many suburban grounds on Saturdays, and
observe excellent and often picturesque cricket to the
rapturous applause of about two men and a dog who are
carefully shielding the sun from the fence. That is
about the strength of the cricket-loving community, con-
sidering it all seriously, which it doesn’t deserve. Of
course, a counter argument is that the men and canines
that are absent from the playing grounds are mostly
playing the “ flannelled oaf ” on pitches of their own. The
argument lacks force. There are quite as many football as
cricket clubs ; yet, during the season of “ scruff,” a great
football community always manifests its presence by
thousands of yawps. No, the great cricket-loving com-
munity is a good deal on its back, playing with baby, or
weeding the garden, or reading the paper, or taking
relaxation at the woodheap. Of course, when “ the cham-
pagne of cricket ” fizzes in the advertising columns of the
dailies, the great, etc., community is in a seething state
of eruption, sporting averages, weather prospects, and
Wisden with all the fervor of a “tough” converted to
Salvarmyism. The secret is that the cricket, etc., com-
munity is wholly epicurean in its taste. Its attitude is
much that of the haw'-ty Australian who requests “No
Colonial rubbish ! ” only it says “ No suburban rubbish ! ”
which is pretty much the same thing.
* * * *
This is the time when you read things like this
in any Australian paper :
“ Over 2000 entries have been received, for the Back o’
Beyond Show, to be opened during the coming week.
All classes were well filled, especially those for hunters. ”
The above is surely calculated to make the public
tired. The “hunter classes” are always “especially
well filled,” and the Show committees rejoice greatly
thereat, and pile up the prize money for these
events ; and shake hands with themselves joyfully.
For these are the classes which transform the State-
subsidised agricultural shows into circuses, and so draw
the great-hearted crowd which loves to sit securely
on a bench and hope against hope that it may see its
fellow-man thrown to earth and sorely injured. But for
any practical good the said events do in encouraging a
breed of local hunters, they might be held in the Obi
Desert. The so-called “ hunters ” which win with
dreary iteration, year after year, at every show in the Ma
State, never see, and never have seen, a pack of hounds.
No one in his senses would dream of riding any one of
them with (say) a drag. True, they can for the
most part safely jump the 4ft. 6in. to sft. fences
that are the convention on N.S.W, show-grounds.
But (1) these aren’t true hunting fences (at British
and Continental shows half-a-dozen different sorts
of jumps are provided); also (2) not one local cham-
pion in ten jumps at a proper huntingpace—the ludicrous
spectacle is frequently seen up-country of a horse check-
ing almost to a walk between leaps ; and (3) the aged per-
formers that win are generally much too jarred and leg-
weary to drag their over-conditioned frames across a
genuine “ country.” The show hunter is usually one of a
big string. He is owned by, and tours the country with, an
impresario who doesn’t go out hunting himself, and who
wouldn’t ride the safest of his champions over half-a-dozen
“ regulation ” fences for a million pounds down. He is
old and shaky in the forelegs, nor are his hocks free from
suspicion. But he knows his game from A to Z—far
better, indeed, than the mostly indifferent rider who is
hired for a few shillings to bestride him. Cautiously he
ambles up to the obstacles ; cautiously he bucks over
them, clearing (unless he falls altogether) by half a foot
front and back. The eight leaps having been negotiated,
he trots from the ring like a tired lamb, and, in
a remote corner between a steam hurdy-gurdy and
a clamorous band of bones and tambourine artists,
stands and ponders on all the decades he has
been doing the same futile stunts. Then a little
later he is called into the ring, and a blue ribbon
is put on his neck—his hundredth or thousandth,
as the case may be—and the lookers on, whose fathers and
grandfathers saw this horse winning ribbons and who
would feel outraged if any other won, cheer loudly and
go home content. It is a curious purposeless sort of"busi-
ness for a Government to encourage. Whether any good
purpose is served by fostering hunters in a State where
hunting is practically a dead letter is arguable ; as to
the foolishness of fostering the bogus Show-hunter there
can’t be any quesdon.
THE PETROL PROPHETS
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The first automobile ever seen in Jerusalem arrived
there on Friday last.— Daily Paper.
There’s a rush and whir in Jerusalem and the smell ol a
petrol car,
And the shades of the people of olden times are gathered
from near and far ;
There’s old Uriah and David too,
The rank and file of the ancient crew,
All of them sniffing and saying, “ Phew !
Is Vengeance coming along?
We haven’t done anything bad of late,
Our whiskers are long and our ways sedate,
And we’ve outgrown Vanity, Love and Hate ;
What is it that’s coming along ? ”
There’s a whiz and hoot in Jerusalem, and a horseless
chariot whirls
Like a devilish thing where the shadows press, and rushes
past David’s girls;
The girls he got when his songs were sung,
In simple days, when the world was young,
And the king went down and walked among
The crowd in the market place.
They are asking David to buy the thing—
All the ladies that dance, and flirt, and sing—
But he wears a frown, does the ancient king,
On his ancient weary face.
It reels through the dust of Jerusalem—the dust that
the sandals stirred
When history spoke as a lisping child, and the songs of
the King were heard ;
It snorts at the centuries that sleep,
At the blind white years that stir and creep,
At the whole lot of Time’s tailings-heap—
It is waking them up, alas !
And the crowd of shadows sit back and stare
While a whiff of burning is in the air,
And the hooting horn bids them all beware
As the Prophets of Petrol pass.

“4711 ” writes The joke of the week is
Wade’s wail re unification ; but, wail as he will,
unification is coming. I have been in many Aus-
tralian towns from Cooktown to Collie within the
last 12 months, and the feeling behind unification
is as strong as was that behind Federation 12
years ago. As a matter of fact, Wade and his
kind are doing more for the cause of Uni’ than
many an ardent believer. .

Beware!
The Drugs I
Beware the pills, the powders, the tonics. If they do
not actually injure your nerves and ruin your stomach,
they deceive you into giving time to wasting disease,
nerve exhaustion, debility or rheumatic conditions to
work further ravages in your constitution, because they
hide the real trouble bv affecting the symptoms. They
give false strength or deaden the nerves, so that pain
ceases, but they do not make real strength or remove the
cause of the pain. They make you feel better when you
are really growing worse. Death lurks in a remedy which
hides the danger. Don’t imitate the foolish ostrich, who
hides his head and thinks he is safe. Don’t hide the real
danger from yourself by means of drugs which stimulate
or deaden the nerves, and which ruin the stomach, and al-
low the inevitable total collapse or incurable state to come
uo unchecked. If you suffer from Nervousness,
Exhaustion, Rheumatism, Sciatica,
Stomach Kidney or Bowel WeaK*
ness, Loss of Vitality, LacK of Vigor,
Varicocele or Rupture, use Nr'u e’s cure—Electricity—as applied with the celebrated
dr. McLaughlin s electric belt
and it will cure you if vou are curable. Electricity is nerve food, no disease or weakness can exist in a body that is
plentifully supplied with it. Our belt will not burn, sting or shock, although the heating, vitalizing thrill can be felt all through
the body as it pours its life-giving power into the nerves, blood and tissues, building them up and driving pain, weakness and
disease out of the system. . . . Our Belts are sold in every civilized country in the world. The thousands of
testimonials we have received from all parts of Australia, and the many years of success we have had here, are absolute proof
that Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt is the standard. We have many imitators but no equals. Don’t be misled by
false “ Free Belt ” offers, or the extravagant claims of those who promise an impossible appliance as a bait for a
20-guinea course of drugs. Don’t taKe Drug's ; use Electricity alone as we apply it and vou will have
nothing to regret. Our prices within the reach of all. All Belts are sent by
parcels post, carriage and duty free to any part of Australia.
FREE
BOOK
We have published an illustrated
book which every man and woman
should read. It shows how and
whv our method cures after the
failure of all other treatments.
It gives the prices and all information about the belts. We will
mail it, together with some of our testimonials, FREE, post paid to
all who write us, and our specialists will give you a diagnosis of your
case free. All communications are treated with strict confidence.

“ Xul ” (who has. just been there) :
Glasgow (Scotland) used to be the most drunken town
in the world. After any festival, the convictions for
“ drunk and incapable ’’(that was the Glasgow-charge:
“ drunk and disorderly ” being reckoned a mere peecal
dillo) outran the bounds of belief. The policemen were
all about 78 inches high, and thick in proportion, and
specially imported from Tobermory, and other parts of
the north, to cope with disturbance and riot born of
much cheap whisky.
Then someone got a bright idea. It was decided to
make the drink ceremony depressing. As a result, the
garish hospitably-beckoning pub of elsewhere became a
thing unknown. The modern Glasgow drinkerv re-
sembles a savings bank. The plate-glass windows are
colored dark-green or dark-red, with no adventitious
allurement. There is one light, and above is the bald
statement, Alexander McYVhirr, Vintner.” That is all.
It might easily be the branch office of an insurance co., or
a usurer's den.‘
Inside there is decorum. Saloon bars and their acces-
sories are practically non-existent. The multitudinous
barmaid incarnadine is replaced by a hard-headed man.
And there al " e a s many rules and regulations on the
'v all as if the place was a workhouse. The atmosphere
is one of thick gloom, and silence, and death. Men go
into this mortuary, drink hurriedly ; and then they
go out hurriedly, feeling that the corpse is still lying on
the slab in the back premises. Nobody could go on a
jamboree in Alexander McVVhirr’s pub. The surround-
ings are too suggestive of a burial.

The Milk Foods closely approximate In composition to
human Milk, the natural and therefore best nourishment for
the young infant
They are as easy of digestion as maternal milk, and
provide a perfect diet for the formation of firm flesh and
strong bones.
The Milk Foods are absolutely free from any noxious
germs, and hence are far superior to cow’s milk as obtained
in towns-
No diarrhoea, digestive or stomach troubles need be feared
from the use of the “Allenburys” Foods.
The Milk Foods can be made in a moment, hot water
only being necessary.
The “Allenburys” Foods are so graduated as to provide
the maximum amount of nourishment that the child is able
to digest at the periods of life for which the foods are re-
spectively recommended. For the robust and delicate they
are alike suitable.

In reply to your letter, dear Fred,
As to why I’m no longer in bed,
Well, the reason’s quite plain,
LAXO-TONIC and pain
Are sworn foes; that’s the least can be said.
Honor to whom honor is due.
This applies, LAXO-TONIC, to you j
I have never been ill,
Since I called you “my Pill,”
I find all that’s claimed for you true.
There was a young lady, a nurse,
Who was so ill she could not be worse,
With anasmia, quite chronic,
But the Pill LAXO-TONIC
Made her well, and put pounds in her purse.
’Tis Leap Year, as everyone knows,
When the girls are allowed to propose j
If a good match you’ll make,
LAXO-TONIC PILLS take,
For they’ll make you as fair as a rose.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Y I HERE’S a renaissance of wonder—
I Lo! A Nation’s born in thun-
der,
O’er three million miles of landscape her rebellious
flag holds sway ;
From the Leeuwin to the Barrier,
From the Bight, white men to carry her
To the Dragon-threatened tropic Gulf of Carpen-
taria.
Aye, behold a country splendid,
Now that John Bull’s reign has ended,
And we ban the wraiths of Fogland, fear no
Alien, know no Boss.
Odes and paeans and oblations
Hail the Youngest of the Nations,
With vast Oceans all around her, and above—the
Southern Cross.
No more precedents we borrow.
Putting off the grim To-morrow,
Yet ’tis well to know that story how the White
Mail’s sun first shone,
That first grand earth-shaking paean
Of the stripling European
When the old Greek blocked the Persian on the
field of Marathon.
For upon To-morrow gory
We shall face that self-same story.
Now old Asia wakes, and Southward her red
Dragon comes apace ;
Shall the Brown man be the right man
For this Last Land, or the White Man ?
Shall the Asian or Australian hold the future of
the race ?
Mates, we need no foreign sages.
With their yellowed, musty pages
To advise how we should govern, what to think,
what not to do ;
There are lessons in the rattle
Of our guns and hymns of battle,
Tn the engines of tall warships watching round
our seas of blue.
Children meek we are no longer ;
In this New World, surer, stronger
We must leave our Mother’s apron, face our fate,
and swear a vow
We shall graft—our grip still staunch is—
Clear off rubbish, root and branches,
Till we stand forth as a nation, and the need is
• Here and Now.
If with fear no more we’re smitten,
Southern deeds shall yet be writ in
That great history book of Doomsday, and—a new
world-wonder tale !
This Republic, young Australian,
Dreading not the hostile alien,
Wake, a miracle in glory, or (if needs must) grandly
fail.
Oh, let’s drop the past to Hades !
Who has doubts, and who afraid is?
Ho ! In triumph we go tramping to our Destiny’s
abode.
Ho ! the tocsins all are ringing,
Young Australia’s marching, singing—
Marching, singing as we’re swinging down the
Future’s open road.
Some may ship Nor’-East this dry land
To their dream-built South Sea Island,
Where beneath the palms and breadfruits till
eternity they rest.
Dreaming aye on yellow beaches,
There the sparkling surf gust reaches—
Rut the children of the Dawdlers have to pat/ blood
interest.
Let our apathy be ended.
Let us build a country splendid—
A young Queen upon Life’s chess-board, not a
rook nor paltry pawn ;
Let our whips—and guns —go cracking
At old Wrongs as men march, tracking
To the gateways of the Future, at the breaking of
the dawn 1
There's a renaissance of wonder ,
Lo ! A Nation's born in thunder.
O'er the Outposts of the White Man her rebellious
flag holds sway,
From the Leeuwin to the Barrier,
From the Bight , brave sons to carry her
Tothe Dragon-threatened tropic Gulf of Carpentaria.
Aye, behold a country splendid
(Doubt and Fear at last hare ended).
For we've banned our traitor Wastrels, fear no
Alien, know no Boss ;
Odes and pceans, and oblations
Hail the Youngest of the Nations,
With the Future all before her, and above, the
Starry Cross.

JIMMIE.
Hikareti.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HIKARETI lived at old Piripi’s kainga,
on the banks of the winding waterway
which leads to Hiroharania (Jerusalem)
and Pipiriki, and—if you go far enough—to the
very centre of Maori life, and, so the legend says,
to the dwelling-place of Mokitapu, the taniwha
with forty heads. Hikareti, who was seventeen
years old, and as beautiful as is her native bush in
the early morning, cared nothing for the taniwha,
and less for the legend. Indeed, since the coming
of Taare (Charles), the pakeha tohunga, she even
scoffed at the atua which Morton, the raw-boned,
one-eyed missionary, had taken such pains to tell
her all about. Morton’s atua seemed such a very
feeble and wooden atua, when viewed through the
critical eyes of the seventeen-year-old half-caste,
that the first blast of Taare’s scepticism knocked
the poor thing out and made Morton an object of
derision to Hikareti. Morton, poor devil, was an
object of derision to many people. He was well-
meaning, but bigoted and dull, and was, therefore,
treated with little respect by the people of Piripi s
kainga and Tenatoa’s pah, which was further up
the river. And Hikareti, whose keen intellect
had been trained from infancy by her dissolute
father, became a believer in the creed of iaare
the tohunga, which was the creed of many ot the
greatest minds of the Old World, and which creed
is designated Nothing. This was very shocking
to Morton, the one-eyed missionary.
Hikareti—which is simply a Maori attempt to
pronounce “cigarette ’’—was the daughter of .lean
Baptiste Le Loup D’Orsay, a scion of an ennobled
French house, and a former resident of New Gale-
doma,' and Kowha, who was a rangitira in her
own right. Jean Baptiste was the possessor of a
nature which knew not right from wrong, and
" hich eventually landed him at the convict settle-
ment in the South Pacific; and it was this same
nature which, refusing to be shamed or broken,
enabled him to plan and put into execution the
most daring escape ever recorded. Undoubtedly
Jean Baptiste had brains. Amongst the Maoris
he ruled as a little god—until his nerve was
broken with waipiro and his eyesight ruined by
whare smoke and other things ; and much of the
crime which took place on the Wanganui was
rightly credited to the scheming “ Hoani.” As
Hikareti grew from babyhood, lie amused his
eccentric mind by imparting to her the rudiments
of an education, interspersed with scientific
theories and social facts. And Hikareti, being
quick, took it all in, and asked for more.
Luckily for her, the disreputable Hoani died
when she was fifteen. Father Henry, the beloved
Henare ” of the upper reaches, happening to
pass Piripi’s shortly after the death of the French-
man, gathered Hikareti into his canoe and took
her to Kurupo, where she received more education
and another view of life. A year of this satisfied
the half-caste girl, and, emulating the deed of her
sire, she evaded her teachers and returned to
Piripi’s.
In the whare where she had formerly lived with
her parents Hikareti found Kowha, grown fatter
and less wholesome; and, with the smell of the
airy dormitory still in her nostrils, she drove the
aged one out by the help of hard blows and shrill
French curses. Kowha, full of lamentations,
appealed to Piripi, but that gallant warrior stated
—with emphasis—that he was too tired to be in-
volved in a family controversy. So she went to
Morton, the one-eyed missionary. Morton ad-
monished Hikareti in his best pulpit manner, and
Hikareti listened attentively. Her questions,
delivered with the unconventionality of a savage
—or a child—flustered the good man. If Kowha
was a nuisance and dirty, and otherwise objec-
tionable, why should not Hikareti turn her out?
Morton floundered badly. Yes, truly, she was
Hikareti’s mother, but was that Hikareti’s
fault? Hikareti thought not. Then Morton,
laboring like a dredge in a heavy sea,
got into his proper stride, and for two
solid hours talked about his Creed, his Church
and his God, and Hikareti sat silent as a
greenstone tiki and listened. When the per-
spiring missionary came to the surface to breathe,
Hikareti announced that she had a headache, and
asked him to call again. Morton went away
delighted. In the meantime, Kowha had to seek
shelter with Apiti and his Wahine.
Next afternoon, Morton sat in the doorway of
Kowha’s whare, and Efikareti sat beside him,
listening intelligently to the exhortations which
fell from the missionary’s lips, and pondering
deeply. Surely the atua of the one-eyed tohunga
was a strange one. Different from the atuas of
Father Henry, and Moßean (the Scots’ “meenis-
ter”), and Lafferton (the Anglican lay-reader),
but still bearing a family resemblance to all three.
The brimstone was promised in each case. To the
girl’s savage nature Morton’s creed appeared
anaemic, and unconsciously she thought of a dozen
ways in which she could deceive his poor little
tame atua and go unpunished. Hikareti spent
her mornings in tending the onion and potato
crops, which the shiftless Kowha had shamefully
neglected, and her afternoons in receiving spiritual
instruction. As she listened, she plied her needle
ceaselessly—she was a skilful dressmaker, and in
great demand —breaking in to ask some per-
tinent question, which would temporarily “floor”
her adviser, and which would take an hour’s solid
going to answer. What Morton lacked in bright-
ness he made up in weight. He was very bitter
against something called “ original sin.’’
“ Original sin was the very devil,” and Hikareti
decided to cast it out.
Amongst the unregenerate ones of the kainga—
and, sad to say, they were in the majority—many
doubtful jokes were made about the frequent
visits of the missionary to Hikareti’s whare, and,
unknown to himself, Morton rose several degrees
higher in the estimation of his dusky brothers.
One with such taste in beauty could not be as big
a fool as he seemed, said the brown people. The
Maori assists his conversation by rolling the eyes
and making many queer grimaces. Morton’s case
called for much facial weirdness. About two
things Hikareti was firm—she would have her
cigarette, and she would not have her Kowha.
Otherwise Morton seemed in a fair way to win
the day.
Charlie London was born to go wrong. Charlie
said that it was owing to the richness of the red
corpuscles in his blood. His father said that he
didn’t care a damn what it was owing to, but that
Charlie had better get out of his sight and stay
there. “It may be sport to rook your friends at
cards,” bellowed London pere, “but, by gad, it’s
damn robberv to steal £2O from your father.”
Which shows that London pere was both angry
and logical. It was at this moment that Charlie
put forward the unbiassed opinion that the red cor-
puscles were to blame. Charlie was too polite to
blame heredity. The Wanganui mercantile firm
of Hutton, Holdem and Grabb was about to open
a store at Piripi’s, and advertised for a steady,
reliable man to take charge. Charlie, backed up
by the last tattered bit of influence and the few
respectable friends whom his love of diversion
had left him, applied for and got the position.
His friends said that it would be the making of
received Charlie with joy. His
virility they admired, his energy amazed them,
but his unscrupulousness was simply a thing to
worship. He was Taare te tohunga the first
week, and ever afterwards. Hikareti, standing
at the door of her whare, saw the stranger
approach, noted the unabashed carriage of his
head and the graceful swing of his shoulders, and
blushed for the first time in her life when his eyes
rested on her. Over the head of the Rev. Josiah
Morton the animal magnetism—or love, or what-
ever it is that attracts sex to sex—leaped from one
pair of eyes to the other, and merged into a
thrilling, exquisite joy. The next instant Hika-
reti, filled with sweet shame, fled into her whare.
Hikareti did not capitulate at once, bhe was
not in love with Morton’s atua, but then Mor-
ton was very much in earnest, especially about
the fiery furnace and the devil with a fork and
two hoofs. It was realistic enough to terrify the
half-caste. Old Piripi said that the pakeha atuas
were all lies, and that Morton was as a stuck pig
squealing in its sty ; but Morton said that Piripi
was an ignorant savage, and would be eternally
damned. Hikareti, who remembered Jean Bap-
tiste and his frank atheism, was sorely puzzled
Surelv Taare, who looked like a young god. and
had lived in big cities and seen life from many
points of view, would know. When next she saw
him, she sprang the question at the storekeeper
It was a novel situation for Charlie, but he knevv
something of Darwin and Haeckel and Herbert
Spencer, and he gave Hikareti the benefit of
what he had read, with some views of us own
interwoven. It seemed convincing to Hikareti.

biliousness
Suffered for Years —Many
Treatments Failed to Cure.
S 3
X
r
Few people now-a-days are free from Biliousness in
some of its many forms. It is an ailment caused, by
I derangement of the functions of the liver. That
wonderful organ manufactures bile to assist in the
digestion of food, and at the same time
filters all waste and harmful matter
from the blood. The liver is at once
the furnace of the body, and the labor-
atory where the food-juices are finally
transformed. Bile Beans are essentially
a liver medicine, and because of their
unique vegetable composition are the
very best remedy for all liver ailments.
Mr. J. Kniplek, of 53 Baptist-street,
Redfern, Sydney, says “ I was a martyr
to Biliousness for many years. I tried
several medicines advertised as a cure for
this distressing complaint, besides consult-
ing doctors, but the relief I received was
of short duration. Not long since,
I received one of your booklets bear-
ing upon Bile Beans, at my house,
and noticing that many complaints
similar to my own had been cured
by Bile Beans, I decided to give this
medicine a trial". I derived great benefit from the
verv first dose, and, continuing with their use. I
j i f Mv wife also derived great benefit from Bile Beans
was restored to perfect.healßr; h wlte We are ne ver without a large box of Bile

THE STANDARD FAMILY MEDICINE.
Bile Beans are the finest medicine ever placed within the reach of the public, and
are a proved cure for Biliousness, Indigestion, Headache, Constipation, Debility,
Piles, Anamiia, Liver Troubles, Dizziness, Pains in the Back and Chest, and are a
boon to pale-faced girls and weak women. Price Is. lgd., and 2s. 9d. per box of all

BILE BEANS
f° R ftILIOUSNESS
After that, Charlie and Hikareti spent their after-
noons wandering in the bush, making love and
being very, very happy. And Morton, of the one
optic, meeting old Piripi, as that noble warrior
waddled about in the autumn sunshine, told him
that Mr. London was no gentleman and not a
proper person to have charge of the morals of one
of tender years.” Piripi, being only an ignorant
savage, considered this his best joke, up to the
time of his death. What he considered the best
after that event cannot be recorded.
It was Charlie’s practice to spend his mornings
at the store, surrounded by a crowd of brown
admirers, with whom he exchanged sallies of wit,
and to whom he sold shoddy goods at exorbitant
prices. He took a pride in swindling both the
natives and his employers, and boasted of it to
Morton. Morton told the elect that Charlie was
a son of Belial, a brother of Ananias, a cousin of
Barabbas, and sundry other things. Peter Tohu,
who was a deacon on Sundays and a blackguard
all the rest of the week, made it his immediate
business to repeat the eulogy to Charlie; and
Charlie, who took an affectionate interest in the
missionary, smiled. He hoped, secretly, that he
was worthy of the remarks.
One morning as Charlie leant over his counter
in the little store, telling a sulphurous story to his
coterie, Morton, pompous as the spirit of Tukenui
—Te Kooti’s exhibition fat man —entered, and
hearing part of the bad tale, flushed painfully,
and “hawed.” Despite the amused looks of
Charlie and the dozen stout natives who sat round
the wall, he then cleared his throat and started a
long harangue. The gist of his remarks was that
Charlie was preventing Hikareti from enjoying
the benefits of salvation, and that when he had
exhorted her to deviate from the broad path which
leads to destruction, she had replied in language
strong enough to fire the bush. News travels fast
in a Maori pah, and before Morton had finished
Hikareti was on him, swinging a hefty manuka
pole. All the hot French blood of her fathers
and the black blood of her mother’s man-
eating ancestors which seethed in her veins
was burning with hatred of this red-headed
man who believed in a narrow creed and
who dared to insult her lover. Morton skilfully
dodged the first swing, but the second caught him
fairly on the spot where his red hair was rapidly
thinning out, and he went down like a pole-axed
bullock. _ . .
Charlie didn’t see Hikareti all the following
week. It was a long, weary struggle nursing a
man in the throes of fever, but he stuck to it, and
on the sixth day his patient recovered conscious-
ness. Twenty-four hours later Morton was well
on the road to recovery, and Charlie stepped out
of the whare to get his lungs filled with the morn-
ing air. At the door he was accosted by two
bewhiskered strangers, and a warrant was read
out. Hutton, Holdem and Grabb had awakened
at last. Yes, the sergeant would give him half-
an-hour to get ready, and the trooper would wait
outside the door for him. Charlie wondered as
he stumbled back to his whare whether the cheap
Belgian revolver would do its work effectively.
His last living act but one was the placing of the
stolen money—some £2oo—where Hikareti alone
would find it.
Charlie had the longest and most gorgeous
tangi that a pakeha ever had. The Maori likes
to bury his dead with honor and a big feast.
When the tangi had subsided, the Rev. Josiah
Morton preached an eloquent sermon, in which
he showed that a man’s sins will always find him
out, and that a righteous man waxeth fat and
prosperous ; and Peter Tohu was so impressed
that he failed to steal more than 6d. from the
offertory.
The Rev. Josiah has certainly waxed both fat
and prosperous, and when he married the most
beautiful girl on the Wanganui she brought him
a dowry of £2OO. She was a French half-caste,
called by the Maoris Hikareti.
MAORI MAC.
A Memory of the Harbor.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
is the memory of a night upon the
I harbor, that I have put away for the winter
of my life—for the old days, the cold days,
when everything is ash.
The sun, a flaming chariot, had driven furiously
across a thirsty land, and the red dust of his going
had just died from the hills. Slowly we drifted
in the indefinite blue of early night, with a thin
wind whimpering about the sails of the boat, and
a bird crying continuously from the land; and
more slowly still we nosed our way through the
vagrant shadows that curved undulating from
the black line of shore.
The vast blue dome towered above, and a thin
blue veil of twilight fell around. Here and there,
fainter blue than the dusk, glimmered the waters
of some little bay, its tiny beaches blotted out.
Beneath us the sea crooned faintly, kissing the
bows with the wet, clinging kisses of a child, and
whispering and scolding gently to itself. Far,
far away sprang an arc —a haze of lights from the
distant city, like quaint fairy palaces across the
blue leagues. In between swooped and skimmed
flocks of golden birds, the lighted ferries plying
to and fro. A ray of light washed athwart the
dark heavens, drifted swiftly across the shipping
at the Quay, lit up a sandy beach and the rigging
of a sailing vessel, then glided towards us over the
face of the waters, flickered on our sails an in-
stant, and slipped overboard and was gone, finger-
ing the shore. Only the lonely rays of the light-
house, seeking from the hill. The shrill wind died
away, and, one by one, the stars flickered out,
hiding the blue with their silver feet, while below
the harbor heaved tiredly, like a weary animal,
drowsed, muttered, and slept. Beyond us loomed
the Heads, black, menacing, against the sky,
Then , and a cry went up from the
darkened waters as a faint glow showed between
the Heads, as of a lamp, shaded by childish hands
and carried into a twilit porch ; and far out the
thin line of horizon shone wan, gleaming gradu-
ally to vivid gold, and the waters that lay between
crept from gold to bronze, to indigo, and to the
thick shadows beneath our bows. Beyond the
towering Heads, whose bases were beset by black,
thunderous waves, fell a shower of gold upon
-the ocean from the heavens, and a ripple of
fire ran across the veil of clouds that banked like
purple hyacinths in the east. As two wings they
fell apart, and, a golden orchid pillaging her
way through purple leaves, rose the moon. A
golden tide broke riotously among the black
waves of night, and, like great birds, shadows rose
from the beaches, leaving the soft, washed sand
agleam and shimmering with shells and the un-
dulating shore bickering with silver spray. Ihe
distant city paled from its brazen glory to a purer
glow As in a dream, we sailed on up that path-
way of gold, it seemed to the very feet of the
moon itself. ,_ ~ , , .
Then we tacked suddenly to avoid a black
collier sharply silhouetted against the sky.
CARO.
Curse Me The City.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’VE little love for the dusty street,
And less for the crowds of men ;
Give me the bush that is cool and sweet.
And the chirp of the little, grey wren ;
Give me the fancies that used to greet
My heart at the dawning then.
Here in the crowd I am one of the crowd,
And the hurrying footsteps beat
In on my brain, where the voices are loud.
In the grind of the soulless street;
Let me stand erect, as of old, and proud,
With the moss beneath my feet.
This is the curse of an ancient land,
Still more the curse of a new.
That the city calls with a fierce command
To the men, where the men are few ;
And they hear her voice, and their wills are sand,
Nor know they the thing they do.
Never the dawning is half so fair,
Nor has sunset such wealth unrolled ;
Naught is there here to do or dare,
As there was in the days of old,
In the days I knew and used to share
With hearts that were all of gold.
A man is a man in the wild, free land,
With a soul to call his own,
In the forest ways where the pine trees stand.
And the winds of God are blown ;
But the city beckons with evil hand—
He catches her brain-sick tone.
Curse me the fool with his evil jest,
Curse me the city’s leer,
Where the best are worst, and the worst are best,
And the laugh is tuned to a sneer ;
And curse me myself, along with the rest,
For that curse is good to hear.
Maokiland.
DAVID MCKEE WRIGHT.
Half a Gale.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE ship went up and the ship went
down.
“ Onions /” groaned the stout person in
the upper berth, sniffing loudly.
Through the porthole the sea was visible, heav-
ing in great, green swells. Afar the verdant, bil-
lowing Victorian shoreline showed faintly in the
failing light.
“Onions ’n’ pepper ! Nice for sheashickness !”
And the ship went up. and the ship went down.
“Steward ! ” yelled the stout person, groaning
again. “ Shooard !’’ and so on twelve tunes.
After a time the steward, who knew his mark,
came in.
“ Yessir ! Wotisit, sir?”
“ Shooard ! Whisky ’n’ water ! ’N’ teller
cooker shutter kitchen door ! ” And the ship went
u-u-up—and down.
Shortly came the whisky. The stout man
sipped it, and then gulped the nobbier down. He
lay back and feebly let the glass drop over the
edge of the berth. It landed on the head of the
person in the lower bunk, who so far had been
weathering the gale in semi-silent suffering.
“ What the—why the blazes! ” roared the under
dog. “ Paralyse y’ ! ” and went back to his semi-
silence, looking up now and again to see if any-
thing further was going to happen.
The stout man raised himself and stared over
the side of the bunk in blank surprise. He caught
the large, reproachful stare of the man below, and
sank back.
“ Well, I’m —— !” he murmured, words failing
him. He attacked the steward instead.
“Shooard! Wot time’s boat get to Shvdney?
Did y’ shut th’ kishen door ? Wot time d’ we get
Shydney ?”
“Why, we’ve just left the Heads, sir!” urged
the steward, getting up from groping after the
whisky-glass.
The stout man’s attention wandered, and his eye
caught the boots notice tacked above the bunk. (
“Shooard!” he bellowed, thickly, “woss’iss?’
“What’s wot, sir?” asked the steward.
“’lss notish. Read it t’ me ! ”
“W’y it says ‘Passengers are requested t’ re-
move ’eir boots before retiring.’ ”
The stout man looked down at his feet, large
and black in the waning light. The ship went up
and the ship went down.
“ Shooard !” he said, abruptly. “ Take off me
booce ! ”
The steward hung back.
“Why, sir”
The reclining stout one groped in his trousers
pocket with a fat hand, and pulled out half-a-
crown.
“Shooard !” he said, “’ere’s shixp’nce for y’
Now, take off m’ booce ! ”
The steward clambered up the ladder and swung
there with one hand, while with the other he
manoeuvred the stout man’s number 10’s. Re-
moving them, he climbed down again, and stowed
them below the lower berth.
The stout man turned over, with his face to the
wall.
“ Shooard,” he murmured, “ ’ow farsh it to
Shydney ? ”
“ Why, sir, we got four or five ’undred miles to
go yet! ”
“Or-ri,’ shooard,” he grunted, sleepily. “Wake
me Shydney, shooard ! ” and, as the youth left, he
breathed heavily into his pillow, and presently
began upon a gentle snore.
A bitter voice came wailing from the lower
berth.
“O, the devil! ”
And the ship went up . . . and the ship went
down!

EMERY WHEELS.
All Sizes, Shapes and Grades of Emery and Corundum Wheels for every possible kind of grinding. These Wheels
are celebrated for Rapidity of Cut, Durability, Safety, and Accuracy. EVERY Wheel is tested before leaving the
works, at a surface speed of not less than 9000 feet per minute, giving a stress of more than 250 lb. per square inch.
. . , ™ nt f to Enier y Wheel Users.— Mount wheels on heavy, rigid machines to prevent vibration-^wheels
should slide freely on spindle to allow for expansion of the latter; cupped flanges about one-third the size should be
placed on each side of the wheel with leather or rubber washers between the flanges and the wheel. Run wheel
towards operator, keeping the rests close to the wheel. Run the wheel at the speed for which it was made—crowding
