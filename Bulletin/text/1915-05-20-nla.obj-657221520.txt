The All-too-Humortess German
The German is a singularly humorless
person, naive, childish, docile, a subject
perhaps more for laughter than hate. Hate
a* equality between the hater and
tne hated: there is something dignified in
being regarded as fit to be hated, while
there is no dignity in an individual who is
laughed at. .It is, of course, the German’s
drilled docility and childish inability to
appreciate the view-point of other nation-
alities that make him such an excellent
soldier; but while appreciating his military
efficiency—the ability to kill and be killed
—our best, and probably our final, attitude
toward him is a thoughtful laughter. So
childish and so servile a person to aspire
h> become an imperial, world-ruling race!
Such school-children to be supermen!
This neglected aspect of the Super-
Sausage is delightfully treated by Edward
Edgeworth, in The Human German
(Methuen, per Dymock’s Library). Aus-
tralians may learn from this book what
would happen if this continent were ever
ruled from Berlin. If you were, for in-
stance, the tenant of a flat, you would have
to promise not to do a hundred things, on
penalty of being ejected.
You may not tub before seven in the morn-
ing or after eleven at night; in winter you
may not open windows for more than an
hour a day; when you make music you
must, at all seasons, keep the windows shut;
you may not wash sheets at home, though
you may wash handkerchiefs; you must not
let your children play on the stairs; you
may keep no animal; you must put a rub-
ber sheet under your typwriter; and you
must not walk in heavy boots after ten.
But this is a trifle compared to what the
Herr-Police-President of Sydney could do.
He would fix the date for opening autumn
sales; he would, like his Berlin confrere,
“forbid artists to paint public automobiles
with purple grape-festoons on a silver back-
ground” ; he could command pedestrians to
cross George-street “at an angle of 43.37”;
he could forbid municipal clerks to live in
the suburbs unless doctors swear they
must, and he could require all bank cashiers
to be photographed because one cashier had
absconded with his bank’s cash, “in order
to facilitate tracing of future embezzlers.”
Beneath the Kaiser’s beneficent rule Aus-
tralians would begin to see the aesthetic
value of food. The crowd at Berlin at
Christmas-time throngs the delikatessen
shops.
It stares at dozens of aerially delicate
baskets with flower-decked handles and cap-
tivating baby-ribbon bows. Baskets like
these a Briton would fill with violets and
send to some other man’s sweetheart. Here
the baskets bear varicolored sausages. And
every sausage has its apropriate bow. The
Brunswick is tied, say, with pink ribbon;
the Salami with blue; while the thorough-
bred Battle-sausage has dark green ribbons
wound about its neck.
And, naturally, nearly every Australian
of the German future would wear a decora-
tion. Every State in Germany, and there
are 23, has orders to bestow. There is no
trade which has not its appropriate star.
We would have undertakers with the Cross
of Honor of Reuss of the Younger Line;
and watchmakers with the House Order of
Watchfulness of the Saxe-Weiman White
Falcon. Which probably explains the pro-
fusion of Iron Crosses: they are necessary
to prevent the other crosses looking lonely.
Sydney, of course, would follow Berlin’s
example and become a world-city. We, too,
would “pay the price of world-cityism,
Smartness, Kino-Culture and cabaretched-
ness.” Like Berlin our death-rate and in-
fant death rate would be high; and a tenth
of the children who reach the age for school-
ing would be put back as unfit. Our illegiti-
macy rate would be four times greater than
London’s. And the Australian would bathe
as the Berlin holiday-maker bathes. The
author’s charming Letitia, being merely
English, has peculiar, un-German views
upon German bathing.
She has seen bathing everywhere, she
says, from red-hot Lido by Yenetia’s shore
where monkey Latins skip in strips of
red cotton to Sestroretsk on Finland’s in-
sipid gulf, where men and maids as bare as
pine-trees wade in side by side. But
Familienbad, though duller far than Lido,
and miles behind Finland for exiguity of
dress, leaves both these beaches behind for
pleasant, innocent freedom. And the dress
is plain enough. The world-cityman, with
ladies, is not ashamed of his bones. Some-
times he wears the irreducible minimum im-
posed in English swimming-baths for men
only. In this Adamic napkin he talks, flirts,
dances, plays games. Ladies approve. Most
wear cork-tight maillot, striped horizontally
in red and white; and they look like models
for picture post-cards.... Letitia and I are
grave and reverend persons; but even we
relax when a white-bearded notary, naked
to the waist and naked a little below, puffs
cigar-smoke in the face of a lady little
less naked, who eyes with passion his copper
skin, and shares his sandwich of ham. Such
is Familybath. It is dryly decorous com-
pared with Freebath, where every Sunday at
12 Frau Houseporter Thieme laces a pink
corset over her bathing-dress, and hops
merrily on her hands. “To the impure,” says
Herr Gamradt, “nothing is impure.”
And when Sydney is sufficiently world-
cityish, the neck-to-knee must go. We shall
adopt Berlin’s Back-to-Nature cult. “Back
to Nature consists in showing your back to
Nature—and also your front.” Then,
wandering in the Blue Mountains, you
would come across delightful colonies of
Back-and-k ront-to-Nature-world-citizens, all
in bathine-dresses, though far from the sea,
and all G£rmanly natural.
at
Australians will also have to learn to be-
come law-breakers. The German way to
make law-breakers is to make so many reg-
ulations that nobody can escape infringing
one of them. One out of every 12 Germans
is now a convict. He has broken a criminal
law. But this does not include the thou-
sands sentenced by minor courts for misde-
meanors, the hundreds sentenced by court-
martial, and the millions fined or imprisoned
for breach of police prohibitions and de-
crees. Enlightened Germans point out that
by a multiplicity of laws crime is eradica-
ted. “The ugly distinction of being criminal
is beneficially obscured in the public mind;
and it will soon be as lower-middle-class
and stupid to get five years’ penal servitude
as it is to get the fifth class of the Order of
the Prussian Crown.” In the new German
Australia we shall not be able to lie, even
in business. In Germany to-day:—
If you lie in advertisements you may be
sent to gaol. It is a crime to advertise a
great reduction of prices unless the reduc-
tion is provably great; and if you hurry
up buyers with the harmless prevarication:
“Only a few left,” you go to gaol. Even
the honorable antediluvian lie about bank-
rupt stock is a crime. A bankrupt stock
must really have come from a bankrupt;
and if the seller throws into a bankrupt
stock a few things which do not belong to
it, then he is a criminal liar. Under threat
of gaol the shopkeeper must say truthfully
in his advertisements whether his sale is
seasonal, stocktaking, clearance, bankrupt
or other; and if he says it’s a clearance
sale, and throws in things which he has
only just bought, he may go to gaol for a
year. Newspapers must see that their
advertisements are true. They may not
print lies—except on editorial pages.
at
We shall have to reform our treatment of
women, to bring it up to the exacting stan-
dard set by Kultur. Germany is essentially
the land of higher Man. It is well to re-
member that Nietzsche never mentioned the
super-woman.
France, says Dr. Gamradt, is governed—
and ably governed—by Ministers’ mistresses;
America—intermediately-—by steel magnates’
wives; and in Russia the Woman Cult is so
high that the honestest tchinovnik will steal
a million if only it helps him to steal a kiss.
And England.. . .The feature in those coun-
tries, and others, is that woman is integral
and an entity; and the feature in Germany
is that she is fractional and auxiliary.
It is all a case of demand and supply.
There are now 2,500,000 superfluous hus-
bandless women in Germany.... and after
the war how many? So in Germany:—
Man is distant, familiar, rude, rudely
polite, condescending, conceited, contempt-
uously chivalrous; and Woman is eye-up-
lifted, adoring, servile, thank-Heaven-he-sees-
me. That is the attitude of Man to Woman
—rather of Woman to Man, for magnificently
passive man needs no attitude. On the
stage where Herr' Assessor v. Jasnicki takes
out a cigar, it is red-haired Friiulein Hertha
who flies for a match, and while he lolls
magnificently with legs on high, lights it
with the reverence of a vestal tending a
millennial flame. And it is Friiulein Hertha
who rises respectfully when Herr Assessor
leaves the room. And down Miiggelsee way
on Sunday. You see them walking out: he,
well-dressed, thick, with Niagaras Of crimson
neck pouring over his collar; she with crim-
son, mittened hands; on his face splendid
indifference; on hers love and pride, earth-
worm humility to him; eagle arrogance to
the world at having him. And when the
pair make for a seat, and, with all the pub-
licity of unashamed England, embrace, it is
she who prints the kiss, and he who yawns.
The future Australian girl, if Kultured.
will be fat; though perhaps her lover will
not begin his love-letters, “My Thick One”
as his highest term of endearment, nor will
she advertise herself, as a pleasantly thick
German girl did in the newspaper, as “A
sympathetic, healthy, rotund phenomenon.”
at
The Human German is emphatically the
best book yet written upon the Super-
Sausage. . Edward Edgeworth writes
kindly, wittily, upon a subject made, for
laughter. He finds even the Kaiser human,
and what is indeed remarkable, discovers a
use for him.
He is a foil to Germanism. Germany’s
plague is dull, full men. Wilhelm the Second
is neither dull nor full; he is bright and
shallowly all-knowing. Germany is plagued
with experts and specialists, who have
studied it all their lives; but Wilhelm has
not studied it at all, and his fulness of
inspired error spurs dull men to motion. Ger-
mans are deeply ignorant in their knowledge ;
but TVilhelm is catholically, comprehensively,
oecumenically learned in hia ignorance.
The Kaiser’s prime virtues are his humanity
and vanity. He is the Kaiser of the camera
and the kinematograph; the only two things
on earth that show the real, that is, the pro-
jected subjective man, or the man as he is
because he wants to look so. The World-
City every week sees a flickering, kinemato-
graph Kaiser who has far more human sub-
stance than the solid, physical Kaiser....
Germany lives because she is kicked and
pricked into vitality. We should perish
without an imperial antidote to bureaucratic
tutelage. The human State does too much
for us. Jt teaches us by standards; drills
us by standards; polices us by standards;
keeps us by standards out of danger and
temptation ; and ends by making us a basket
of 65 million identical, uninteresting eggs.
We want an irritant and a stimulant
There is one thing which we only have given
to humanity—that is the World-Stimulant.
Wilhelm the Second is the World-Stimulant.
Robert Bridges, Prose Laureate
The impression left by F. E. Brett
Young’s “critical study” of Robert Bridges,
the present poet laureate, leaves the reader
still wondering why Bridges was chosen for
that particular sinecure. The book consists
of laudation tempered with apologies.
There is that in his work which has not
been heard in English poetry since Shelley
died —the note of joy... .He is the first man
to bring the atmosphere of the English land-
scape into poetry with all its delicate changes
and shifting color.
But
As a poet he is not among the greatest; he
treads too deliberately the middle course
between imagination and fact, without the
inclusive vision that is the crowning glory
of the classic style. He lacks, too, the sus-
tained ecstasy of imagination which is the
birthright of the greatest poets.
Yet
Of the real stuff of poetry, of beauty, and of
joy, of perfect sympathy and expression, he
brings us more than any poet since Keats....
Most of his collected Shorter Poems have, I
think, the authentic accent of immortal verse.
Brett Young finds that Bridges is what
we should call a wowser. His conception
of love, we learn, “is more nearly love
according to the Book of Common Prayer.”
“However much we may attribute his early
avoidance of the physical in his love-poetry
to a conscious choice and rejection olf
material from the standpoint of poetics, we
cannot forget that he was born into an age
which worshipped the proprieties to a posi-
tively indecent extent.”
In that higher court in which poets judge
poetry, and time ponderously endorses the
verdict, the Shorter Poems will take their
place infallibly, acquitted of blemish, affecta-
tion, untruth, fashion and littleness, among
the finest products of English genius.
But
Their fault is a feeling of remoteness,
even in the most actual of the poems; a
sense that Bridges’ instrument, with all its
delicate resources and exquisite stops, is
something lacking in volume and tone.... So,
with the mighty ardors of physical passion
he puts away the tenderness of maternity.
Even the pageants of history do not call
him... .while heroism in the abstract is fore-
gone, for the poems of the Boer war are in-
tensely personal in feeling, and hardly happy
in expression.... From the lyrics of Robert
Bridges the more heroic moments of the
human drama are absent.
No wonder Brett Young asks: “So much
of the old material he has sacrificed. What
has he left us; and can there be any beauty
that is new?”
And, meticulously searching, he finds
that “a part of the great strength of his
poetry lies in these very limitations.” Re-
duced to plain Australian, the author’s
argument is that the fact of Bridges being
an uninspired poet makes him a great one.
“Bridges rarely attempts to pierce to the
mysterious heart of things. His genius is
reflective rather than intuitive.... Bridges
is not a mystic poet, a metaphysical poet, or
a romantic poet. He does not transfuse
the shows of nature in a white heat of
imagination.” Returning to blanky Austra-
lian, Bridges is not a poet. And surely
apology masquerades as praise when Brett
Young can say, “Bridges is one of the few
poets who have dared to take the lanes and
meadows for granted without craving to
say something fine about them.” In ordi-
nary Australian, he is a poet who magnani-
mously refuses to become poetical over his
subject.
Bridges has, of course, written many
plays. All that his critic can find in these
plays is “a good deal of ingenious stage-
carpentry ; the twisting and unravelling of
a. number of intricate knots that have no
very serious connection with the skein of
life; and a great deal of very beautiful lyric
poetry that crops up in the most unlikely
places.” One play has even “a flicker of
dramatic intensity.” His people “are not
conceived in terms of flesh and blood”; and
there is “an incredible number of banalities
which stand out m relief from their pre-
tentious setting.” Of one of his plays
Brett Young notes that he had “searched
vainly through the play for a single passage
that seemed really worth quoting, either for
its dramatic merit or as poetry.”
d*
The only aspect of Bridges’ work that
gives him a claim to be ranked as a poet is
what his critic calls his “mosaic method.”
His is the most careful craftsmanship,
deliberately an elusive craftsmanship, an
effect of the brilliant use of assonance and
rime and rhythm.
It seems as if a word which has once
borne an important part in a color-scheme
suggests harmonics in the tonal effect of a
line, related here by assonace and here by
rime to some other parts of the structure,
and bearing a subtle share in the rhythmic
scheme, will give out more purely its in-
trinsic color and beauty....lt is impossible
to exaggerate the technical complexity of
this later method. Nothing is to be gained
by dissecting all the devices that go to the
making of its polyphony. There is none
that is actually new in English verse, but
no poet has lavished and combined them so
confidently as Bridges. At times they are
spun together with an almost incredible
mastery; one would be dazzled by the
jugglery of the technique if it were not
■always, or nearly always, subordinate to
the form of the whole. ...It may be ob-
jected that many of these assonances are
unintentional —chance relations to be found
in all poetry, or, for that matter, in all
prose. I should agree to the extent of sug-
gesting that they are nearly all uninten-
tional, or, if you will, inspired. The
standard which will decide how far "they
are worth noticing is their power of thrust-
ing themselves on our notice by the beauty
of their effect.
Brett Young quotes some “delightful
double assonances” :
Beneath the sun at indolent noonday
Or in the windy moon-enchanted night....
.... With beechen moss
And holly sheen. ...
And he concludes: “We are a long way from
the day when the control of local color and
consonantal dynamics may be taught as
definitely as the mixing of colors on a
palette.”
But this delicate ear for assonances is
but part of the infinitely complex birth-
right of greater poets; Bridges brings it
forward as his greatest gift. And by that
stress on a minor talent, in one so obviously
lacking in inspiration, his critic writes
Bridges down as no great poet.
In his studies of prosody, however, Robert
Bridges deserves our praises. Here “he
breaks really new ground,” but as prosodist,
not poet. Bridges’ innovation, from his
study of Milton’s prosody, is the substitu-
tion in verse for a line which is measured by
syllables a line which is measured by
stresses. The two mechanical elements of
English verse are a strict line-length and
varied stresses, and it must be from a com-
bination or opposition of these that rhythm
emerges. The prosody of Bridges is a
combination of the stress and syllabic
methods. Stress-prosody is simply the re-
cognition of the speech-phrase as the ruling
principle of verse without the hindrance of
a constant line. Bridges went to the length,
in Milton's Prosody, to formulate some of
the rules of stress-verse thus: —
The stress governs the rhythm.
The stresses must be true speech-stresses.
A stress has more carrying-power over the syllable
next to it than it has over a syllable removed from
it by an intervening syllable.
A stress has a peculiarly strong attraction for its
own proclitics and enclitics.
A stress will not carry a heavy syllable which is
removed from it by another syllable.
A stress will not carry more, than one heavy
syllable or two light syllables on the same side of it.
In some metres when four, and in any metre when
more than four, unstressed syllables occur together,
they will occupy the place of a stress, which may
be said to be distributed over them ; and a line in
which such a collection of syllables occur will lack
one of its stresses.
But the rhythm of verse is due to an un-
varying line-length putting a succession of
speech-phrases— i.e., stresses each attracting
its own subordinate syllables—within a
line of a length that does not vary.
If we do away with the unvarying
line-length, say, the five-foot of blank
verse, and write purely in stress, how
are we going to get poetic rhythm? Up to
the present, writers have not found an
adequate substitute for the line-length.
Bridges’ method is to avail himself of all
the freedom which a stress-prosody allows,
and at the same time to mitigate with every
available device the anarchy to which it
leads. Briefly, he abolishes syllabic strict-
ness for the sake of introducing new and
expressive speech-rhythms, and simultane-
ously restores the element of time. The
whole of his achievement in stress-prosody
is to enforce the idea of regularity in line-
length, while avoiding suggestion of a re-
current bar-beat.
In other words, the poet must choose the
middle way between music and prose.

Long before science

as they do it to-day.

out all there is to know

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Three Kings of Anaghlone.
Three kings rode down the road to-day
On a bay and a black, and a dapple grey—-
Och, fairy kings of dreams were they—
And the flax in the field is blue.
The first king doffed his plume to me,
And the second knelt on bended knee,
And, och, the third was fair to see,
But his rein he never drew.
’Twas from the old stone walls they came,
The old stone walls that have no name,
Where the lovers go to court —small blame
To their hearts when the flax is blue!
Och, the first tall king was bearded grey,
And the second rode in his prime to-day,
But the third was a boy with love-curls gay
And his rein he never drew.
The wise man came to the gate to-day.
Now what bright kings that rode were they?
For two would pass and one would stay,
And the flax in the field is blue.
The oldest king had a smile for me,
And the next made love on bended knee.
And, och, the third was fair to see,
But his rein he never drew.
If two rode by and one would stay
’Twas a foolish heart that said him nay,
For the Old Time’s done and passed away
And the flax in the field is blue.
And the young king goes with the curls of
gold
And his love is a dream that’s hard to hold.
For the Time-to-Oome is a name that’s told,
But his rein he never drew.
Three kings rede up the road to-day
On a bay and a black and a dapple grey—-
Och. fairy kings of the world were they—
And the flax in the field is blue.
The first king doffed his plume to me.
And the second kist me bold and free.
And the third—och. it got too dark to see.
But his rein he never drew.

The Old Fossicker’s Lament.
I see that clear —it’s goin’ fast,
The old bush life I like the best,
Wi’ glories o’ the golden past,
The nuggets, an’ the rest.
The life has changed. But well I mind
How pockets once were stuff’t wi’ gold.
But, Lord! Good times are far behind,
And now I’m growin’ old.
The roarin’ days come back no more,
Me mates are dead an’ gone, an’ I
Just say the same thing o’er and o’er —
I’ll fossick till I die.
Yer batt’ries throb, an’ chimneys blaze,
The ore-trucks rumble to the sheds,
An’ wheels are turnin’ diff’rent ways
A-top the poppet-heads.
It ain’t the same. Ye chip the reef
An’ crush it in the dolly-pot,
An’ work be wage an’ shift—my grief!
A sober, steady lot.
I rub me eyes, there’s somethin’ wrong;
Ye bank yer cheques, as I can see —
Young chaps who have no jigs, nor song,
Nor fights, nor jamboree.
An’ women now —-I’ve travelled far,
But never one I’ve met to show
Like her who stood behind the bar,
The pride o’ Bendigo.
There’s no fun here. I’ll take me dish,
And roll me swag, an’ wander on.
This ain’t the life what we could wish.
The old bush school has gone.
But, say, there’s gold about here still;
Aye, gold in all them gullies round,
An’ there’s more gold in yon old hill
Than ever yet’s been found.
I know yer towns an’ minin’ ways,
Deep shafts an’ all, an’ pass ’em by,
An’, thinkin’ o’ the early days,
I’ll fossick till I die.

The Law and I.
The Law and I are sorts of friends ;
L never have beset
The Law with empty bottles, and
It has not hanged me yet.
We get on very well, we two ;
And I will not agree
That it is stern. Behind its mask
I’ve seen it wink at me.
Its myrmidons, they often come
With documents of blue,
Reminding me in phrases grim
That there are moneys due.
I like these myrmidons. They are
Polite as anything,
And read their statements to me like
Petitions to a king.
I always thank them for their pains,
And. if they take the wink,
In unite a nice and friendly way,
We go and have a drink.
And there it ends. T do not go
To face his Worship’s curse;
The paper in my pocket lies,
Marked o’er with notes of verse.
If it should gratify mean knaves
To pay a little fee,
And get a judgment out with costs,
It matters not to me.
Where’er I meet the Law it shows
What deference it can ;
I think it has a great respect
For a much-summoned man.

Sensational Triumph for
De Witts
Mam 76 years old
Cured of STONE in the Bladder.
Surgeon amazed —no operation.
Here is one of the most sensational
and wonderful cases on record. It is
not an exaggeration, blit just the plain
and truthful statement of a very well-
known old English gentleman, seventy-
six years of age, who was cured of
stone in the bladder, without operation,
when almost all hope had been aban-
doned.
About four years ago this old
gentleman —Mr. C. J, Watts is his
name —w a s taken
very ill with severe
pains in the back
and a burning,
aching pain inter-
nally. He suffered
badly from urinary
weakness. He be-
came so ill and the
pain became so bad
that he could not
bend or even turn
in bed. Mont h
'after month he
tried all kinds of
advice and so-called
remedies, including
“Kidney Mixtures”
an d “Backache
Pill s,” hut he
got no relief.
He got steadily
worse, until at the end of four years
he had practically given up all hope
of being cured.
SECOND BOX-CURED.
One day he heard of the wonderful
cures effected by De Witt’s Kidney and
Bladder Pills, and he went to Boots’
shoo in Caledonian Road and got a
2s. 9d. box. He finished this box and
commenced on another. Before he had
finished the second box he passed from
the bladder two large, awful-looking,
rouyh stones and several small ones,
all covered rvith sharp-pointed crystals.
This happened on December 30, 1913,
about six o’clock in the morning.
Mr. Watts was so impressed with the
sim of these stones, which seems so
exti aordinary, that he took them and
showed them to a well-known doctor,
who expressed astonishment that such
stones should have been passed with-
out an operation, and especially by
a man of seventy-six years of age.
Mr. Watts, in writing the proprietors
regarding this wonderful incident,
Mr. C. J. Watts (from pliotoj.
states: — I “Many people might doubt the
truth of this letter, but I am well known
in thi A district, and have only stated the
bare facts. Apart from my own case of
Stone in the Bladder, I have heard of a
lot of cases of Rheumatism, Gout, Back-
ache,' Cystitis (Inflammation of the
Bladder), and other Kidney and Blad-
der complaints which have been cured
by De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills.
DE WITT'S ALONE
SAVED HIM.
“I live at G 2 Hunt-
ingdon Street, Barns-
bury, N., and if any-
body still doubts that
De Witt’s Kidney and
Bladder Pills really do
cure, let them refer to
me and see for them-
selves, for I certainly
think that others
ought to know of this
marvellous remedy.
“I have heard of
young people being
cured of this painful
complaint, but a
remedy which will
cure a man of 76
years of age is surely
the greatest of all.”
De Witt’s Kid-
ney and Bladder
Pills can be ob-
tained at any of
the branches of Washington H. Soul,
Pattinson & Co., Ltd., Sydney, Long-
rn ore’s The Melbourne Pharmacy,
Bourke Street, Melbourne, and all lead-
ing Chemists at 2/9 and 5/6 per large
box. The 5/6 size is two and a half
times as large as the 2/9 size, and con-
tains enough doses to last you three
weeks.
Try your nearest chemist, but if you
have any difficulty in obtaining De
Witt’s Pills send the price of the
package required to either of the firms
mentioned above, and the goods will be
sent by return, post free.
To cure Kidney Trouble of any kind
you must positively get rid of the cause
—the poisonous Uric Acid. Remember,
to do this, a real remedy must pass
through the kidneys and the bladder,
and not through the bowels, as most
kidney pills do. When you see the
Urine change to a muddy bluish color—
a feature which distinguishes De Witt's
Pills from all others—you know beyond
all doubt that they have put tVeir heal-
ing touch on the right spot—tlsb kidneys
and the bladder. A wonderful pill—
straight to the kidneys—that is the rea-
son why De Witt’s give such amazingly
quick relief —eve-v time. A permanent
cure follows almost in every case.

A COMMUNITY WHICH REQUIRES
DYNAMITE, AND IS GIVEN
CHLOROFORM.
It is rare to find an Australian who takes
the war with genuine seriousness. Of
course there is the personal grief of those
who have lost relations or friends; and it
is customary to assume an air of pained
wonder when the news of some fresh atro-
city comes to hand. But that is about
all there is to it in 90 per cent, of cases.
Very few treat the war as what it is—the
most dreadful menace which has confronted
Australia and the British Empire in their
history. Amongst the very rich it has
aroused nothing like the passionate enthu-
siasm that, say, the Dreadnought scare did.
To put the financial acid on the question—
as reliable a test as any—millionaires who
were ready to give tens of thousands to the
Dreadnought fund to-day hesitate about
parting with as many hundreds. It is not that
the rich man of 1915 is any less patriotic
than the plutocrat of 1910. He has simply
become convinced that all danger is past
and victory a certainty. He knows that
Germany is eating bread made out of pota-
toes ; that it is already hungry and will soon
be starving ; that in the West the business
of pushing the Kaiser’s army over the
Rhine may begin at any moment, and that
in the East the Russian steam-roller is get-
ting steadily nearer to Berlin. Whoever
casts doubts on theSe cheery fancies is a
mean-spirited hound, unworthy to be classed
among the sons of Emnire. The war will
be over, Germany beaten and the Kaiser
exiled (or, better still, hanged) in three
months, or at the most six. Then will come
the glad process of collecting the indemni-
ties. Our share of the spoil will recoup us
for every sacrifice. The great war will
have paid a generous dividend. Everybody
will be richer than ever.
* * * *
This is the irresponsible rubbish that is
being talked in a thousand bars and trains
and dubs at -the present ■moment,- It is
more ridiculous than Germany’s Hate Cam-
paign ; and, where the Teuton absurdity
may have some national advantage, ours can
only do harm. The parties chiefly to blame
are those big dailies which supply all the
political thinking that is done in very many
homes. The astonishing Censor’s Depart-
ment has, no doubt, to share part of the
ignominy. But its functions are mostly
negative. The Censor is content to say
what shall go out. It is the newspaper’s
stipendiary optimist who decides upon the
glozing blither that is to go in. We rarely
hear that Hill (say) 150 has been lost to
the enemy till we learn of its re-capture by
the Allies, after a desperate battle, in which
the casualties on both sides were prodigious.
When the French line is driven back five
miles it is a masterly retreat; when the
same thing happens to the Germans it is
a smashing defeat. Our centre is pierced:
n; is good strategy. The German centre
yields ; their morale is broken and the begin-
ning of the end is near. The military
experts of the journals have given us so
much about German “routs,” Austrian dis-
affection and lack of organisation and cash,
Italian sympathy for the Allies, and Rou-
manian and Greek detestation of Germany,
and . so many hopeful forecasts as to the
brief duration of the struggle, that they
grow tiresome. The spiritual brandies and
sodas with which newspaper-readers are
bucked up every morning are beginning to
lose their effect. A vague sentiment begins to
get abroad that these cries of triumph are not
so disingenuous as they book, but are pdrt
of a considered design to keep stocks, shares
and land values booming.
The best patriotism, at the present junc-
ture, when thousands of our countrymen
are gallantly, hanging on to positions which
might be occupied by hundreds of thousands
of them were the arms nnd equipment
problem in a more satisfactory state, is to
speak without reference to the views of
the big financial interests. Public-house
braggadocio and vituperation and aloof con-
tempt of a formidable enemy never yet won
a battle. Our traditional custom of leaning
back comfortably and remarking that the
Empire is bound to “muddle through in the
end” may be well enough for South Africa,
but it is no good for Armageddon. To talk
of this war being over in six months at the
present rate of progress is unfair to our-
selves and a thousand times more so to the
men who are fighting for us, and who need
every fragment of aid and enthusiasm that
we can send them. What are the facts of
the case? It is gravely to be feared that
Germany is suffering from none of those
evils which our flag-wagging fat-heads talk
about so confidently. True, most of its
colonies have been taken, and its mercantile
marine has been driven off the seas. But it
is not near starvation. An American
banker, just returned from Berlin, gave the
London Daily Mail (2/4/T5) what that
paper termed “the truth of the situation in
Germany.” Some extracts :
I have just closed my house in the fashionable resi-
dential part of Berlin. My household budget was not
more than 25 per cent, higher on March 10 than it
was on July 10, 1914. Various staple articles of food
cost more, but hardly one is beyond the reach of the
ordinary middle-class householder, or even of the
humbler classes. Everybody must have ,a; bread-ticket,
but there is no shortage of bread. My family of four
and two servants never used the whole of our ticket
for the week.. . .Trade does not seem to have materi-
ally declined. Wertheim’s and Tietz’s, the two great
shops, appear to have their regular flow of custom-
ers. The coffee-houses, the restaurants, the theatres,
the concert-halls, the picture palaces and other estab-
lishments dependent on public patronage seem to be
doing as well as eight months ago.
It was hoped, for some time, that Germany
might be hit by a copper or petrol shortage.
But the German chemists are making petrol
substitutes from potato spirit and coal. And
as regards copper. Dr. Ernst Noah, an
authority of as reliable a character as it is
possible for a German to be, stated the
other day that “Germany had a million tons,
the result of importing annually, for five
years _ before the war, 200,000 tons more
than it consumed.” Also, the London Times
said recently: “Leading merchants have no
doubt that large consignments of copper ore
have reached Germany through neutral
countries”; and it pointed out, later, that
the list of goods whereof shipment to Ger-
many was prohibited at the outset of the
war did npt include “Copper regulus or
matte, which might contain up to 70 per
cent, of copper.” The German banking
machine, which has enabled the Govern-
ment to raise from the people two war loans
totalling £750,000.000, is just as Socialistic
and nearly as efficient as the German war
machine. How are forces like these to be
quickly overcome without stupendous
efforts ?
* * * *
For the sake not only of the men in the
trenches, but of those who will never fight;
and for the ultimate profit of rich and poor
alike, this requires to be made a reasonably
brief war. No one doubts that Germany
must go under in the long run —anything
else would be unthinkable. The danger of
that attitude of jaunty confidence which is
so prevalent is that the German resistance
may be enabled to last for a very long time.
The majority are drifting happily along the
primrose paths of Empire-Day blither
because they are doped—doped with garbled
cable-messages and the cheerful prognosti-
cations of the sort of war-experts who fore-
told that the Boers would be subdued in a
month. The dope needs to be taken away.
It might be the worst thing that ever hap-
pened to Germany if its armies burst
through the Allies’ lines and took Calais and
invested Paris. Vast sections in the United
Kingdom, in Australia and elsewhere who
are now dozing under the influence of press
soporifics, would then wake up. They
would call for high Protection as a
means of creating those industries which
will .be needed, amongst other things, to
nrovide work for the soldiers who return.
For the organisation of the workers in such
a way that each man, could give the best
that was in him tp 'the State. For con-
scription—at any rate during the progress
of the war. For the summary hanging of
all swindling army contractors. In short,
for a nurnber of strenuous measures fitted
to the violence and unusualness of the
times. But we will never get anything of
the sort while the papers which are read
by . the multitude, maintain their present
attitude. Australia and many other parts
of the Empire, may be said to be languishing
for Bad News.
INSURING AGAINST THE RESULTS
OF THE POLITICIAN’S APATHY.
The Conference of Premiers which sat in
Sydney last week when it wasn’t out for a
trip on the Harbor passed a more or less
meaningless and wholly futile resolution in
favor of a national scheme of insurance
against unemployment. This is not a mat-
ter on which State Premiers are able to bind
themselves or anyone else, and the resolu-
tion is obviously an electioneering sprat cast
on the waters of hope. But though the Pre-
miers have in one sense done .-no more than
follow the ear-tickling impulse, common to
all politicians, they have also 1 by this resolu-
tion revealed one of Australia’s great weak-
nesses—the incapacity of its leaders to
realise the conditions precedent to social and
material development. The organisation of
industry in Australia is on a basis wholly
different from the organisation of industry
in (say) Germany, where unemployment
insurance found a natural place in an indus-
trial arena highly systematised. The indus-
trial machine in Australia Bears no relation
either to the British 1 machine, on which a
scheme of insurance was recently welded—
with, as yet, doubtful results. In the older
countries industry is centralised; it affects
large stationary bodies of people. In Aus-
tralia the population is fluid; much of its
work is seasonal, a great deal of it is acci-
dental ; only a fractional part of the general
community is penned down to one place and
one calling from childhood to old age. In-
dustries in old manufacturing countries are
subject to sudden fluctuations and serious
disturbances caused by failure of supplies of
raw material and by competitive embarrass-
ments. They can therefore only be carried
on by having on hand a large supply of sur-
plus labor, which is rightly regarded as hav-
ing, during periods of enforced inactivity, a
claim on industry for support. That is not
the case in Australia. Here the real
problem of statesmanshin is not how to in-
sure people against the risk of starv-
ing between jobs, but how to afford
them abundant opportunities for work.
The unemployment common in old manu-
facturing countries is one thing; the missihg
of toil in a new country where thousands of
jobs await the doing is something very
different. The two evils spring from differ-
ent roots.
* * * *
Australia is one of the world’s continents,
but, unlike the others, is to-day almost
virgin, . inhabited by a -comparative
sprinkling of people, unequally distri-
buted in most part along the sea-
board. In the agricultural sense her
soil has scarcely been stirred; pastorally
the possibilities of the country could be enor-
mously expanded by water conservation. In
mining there are vast openings for science,
enterprise and labor. In the Northern
Territory the nation has on hand a tract of
country having almost boundless potentiali-
ties, yet practically empty. The need of
Australia is intelligent direction. There are
jobs by the thousand awaiting attention.
The poverty of factories on the one hand,
and the number and wealth of the import-
ing interests on the other, is a monument to
the imbecility of people who, under the pre-
tence of nation-building, neglect their obliga-
tions, and yet babble about insuring the
community against not having the job which
it deliberately passes on to Jacob Strauss
and Uncle Samuel. The weary old farce
of dragging hides and wool one way and haul-
ing leather and fabrics back again goes
merrily on ; and the Australian, who, in-
stead of being at work in fellmongeries and
woollen mills, stands about on busted boots,
is told that the only way a meal can be pro-
vided for him is to see that he is insured —
and this in a country where every acre and
wharf and warehouse calls for the popula-
tion to get its coat off and turn to !’
* * * *
Australia’s need is that Australians shall
be kept busy doing the work that has to be
done—building dams and sinking bores and
locking rivers; handling the forests with
enlightenment and care; sowing and reaping
crops ; making the earth multiply its fruits;
building railroads and steamers; opening up
and extending mines and smelting ore;
making their own pants and hats and every-
thing else they eat and drink and wear.
Above all else, it needs that the people shall
forswear the vices of the politicians, and
boot into the sea those empirical wooden-
heads whose cowardice and ineptitude alone
make it possible for unemployment to be
even an occasional feature of life in the
Commonwealth. The nation cannot go on
for ever as it is doing now, drugging itself
with loans as an anodyne for the pains that
wrack the economic frame. An end must
come to the drunk some day—a time arrive
when Australia will be driven, as other coun-
tries, to. live by hard, honest work, instead
of razzling on the proceeds of p.n’s. and
lOU’s. But instead of realising this- and
acting on the principle of widening the aven-
ues to employment, and conserving for the
use of the people the money now squandered
abroad, the aim of political parties seems to
be to keep the orgy of boom and borrow in
full blast, and to compound soothing syrup
for the ailments created by this reckless dis-
regard of duty. Unemployment is an evil
thing.. Its consequences are deplorable. But
its existence here is wholly due to defects in
industrial organisation; and if Australian
politicians, did what they are allegedly paid
for doing, it would have no place in the Com-
monwealth, where the opportunities for work
are boundless.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Wanted: An Inquiry that Will Inquire.
The two Courts-martial in Sydney last
week were pretty well everything that judi-
cial tribunals should not be. In the first a
reputable business man, holding the rank of
colonel, was arraigned for the larceny of
ship’s tableware of the value of half a soyer-
eign. In the second a lieutenant jvas
charged with stealing German medals which
an expert estimated to be worth “two or
three shillings.” In law proper the first
essential to a felony is mens rea, or “intent.”
Who is there so imbecile as to believe that
officers drawing respectively £2 10s. and 15s.
per day would openly take articles worth a
few shillings with felonious intent? In all
warfare there are two sorts,of looting: there
is the wholesale burglary of private houses
—the sort the German Crown Prince in-
dulged in—and there is the collecting of dis-
carded weapons and other mementoes of
small intrinsic value—a practice which is
being followed at the present moment by the
most punctiliously honest of the Allied
troops. _ Under a rational legal system the
cases which were heard last week, since they
related at the worst to the acceptance _of
mementoes, would never have gone to trial.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
On the day we hit the transport there was
cheerin’ on the pier,
An’ the girls were wavin’ hankies as they
dropped a partin’ tear,
An’ we felt like little heroes as we watched
the crowd recede,
For we sailed to prove Australia, and our
boastin’ of the breed.
There was Green, who’d come from clerkin’
in a Sydney clothin’ store;
There was me an’ Craig, of Queensland,
with his hulkin’ six foot four;
An’ little Smith, of Colljngwood, who
howled a ragtime air,
On the day we left the Leeu\yin bound nor’-
west for GoD-knows-where.
On the day we came to Cairo with its
niggers an’ its din,
To fill our eyes with desert sand, our souls
with Eastern sin,
There was cursin’ an’ complainin’; we
were hungerin’ for fight—
Little imitation soldiers full of vanity an’
skite.
Then they worked us — God ! they worked us,
till we knew what drillin’ meant;
Till men began to feel like men an’ wasters
to repent;
Till we grew to hate all Egypt an’ its
desert, an’ its stinks,
On the days we drilled at Mena, in the
shadow of the Sphinx.
Then Green of Sydney swore an oath they
meant to hold us tight,
A crowd of flamin’ ornaments without a
chance to fight;
But little Smith, of Collingwood, he
whistled him a tune
And said, “Aw, take a pull,, lad; there’ll be
whips o’ stoushin’ soon.”
It was waitin’, weary waitin’ while we
itched to meet the foe;
But we’d done with fancy skitin’ an’ the
comic-op’ra show:
We were soldiers, finished soldiers, and we
felt it in our veins
On the days we trod the desert on old
Egypt’s sandy plains.
An’ Green, of Sydney, grew morose, and
all of us were blue,
An’ Craig, the giant, never joked the way
he used to do;
But little Smith, of Collingwood, he
hummed a cheerful song
And said, “You leave it to the ’eads. Oh,
now we shan’t be long!”
Then Sari Bair, O Sari Bair, ’twas you
that saw it done,
The day the transports rode your bay be-
neath a smiling sun ;
We boasted much, in’ toasted much; but
where your tide line creeps,
’TwaS you, my lovely Sari Bair, that saw
us play for keeps.
We were full of savage skitin’ while they
kept us on the shelf
(Though I tell you, strictly secret, I was
doubtin’ us meself) ;
But we proved it good and plenty that our
lads can do an’ dare
On the day we walloped Abdul on the
sands of Sari Bair.
Luck was out with Green, of Sydney,
where he stood at my right hand,
For , they plunked him on the transport
’fore he had a chance to land.
Then I saw them kill a feller that I knew in
Camberwell—
Somethin’ sort o’ went inside me, and —-the
rest was plain, hot Hell.
Through the smoke I saw him strivin’,
Craig, of Queensland, strong and tall,
Like a harvester at hay-time, shouting “Set
’em ! On the ball!”
And little Smith, of Collingwood, he
howled a fightin’ tune
On the day we chased Mahomet over Sari’s
sandy dune.
An’ Sari Bair, O Sari Bair, you saw how
it was done —
The transports dancin’ in your bay beneath
the kindly sun ;
An’, speckled on your gleaming shore, the
little huddled heaps
That shpjved at last the Southern breed
could play the game for keeps.
We found him, Craig, of Queensland, stark,
his hand still on his gun;
We found, alas! too many more when that
fierce fight was won ;
An’ little Smith, of Collingwood, he
crooned a mournful air
The night we planted them beneath the
sands of Sari Bair.
On the day we took the transport there was
cheerin’ on the pier,
An’ we were little China gods; and now
we’re sittin’ here
With the taste of blood and battle strong
upon us, ev’ry man,
And every man but Lopin’ to end up as we
began.
For Green is gone, and Craig is gone, and
God ! how many more,
Who sleep the sleep at Sari Bair beside the
sun-kissed shore?
An’ little Smith, of Collingwood, a bandage
round his head,
He hums a savage song and vows swift
vengeance for the dead.
But Sari Bair, 0 Sari Bair, the secrets
that you hold
Will move the hearts of Southern men when
all the tale is told.
The sun that lit your smiling bay bore wit-
ness to the deed,
The day our father’s fighting blood woke in
the Southern breed.
VICTORIA.
C. J. DENNIS.


Fortunately there was no miscarriage of jus-
tice, and both accused were honorably ac-
quitted. But that does not end the Rabaul
scandal, or alleged scandal. Anstey, M.P.,
announced in Parliament that there had been
looting, by both officers and men, “on a
wholesale scale.” He mentioned names.
He claimed to be able to prove his words.
He worked to such purpose that the alleged
victims of an allegedly corrupt military tri-
bunal —men who were sentenced to three and
four years’ penal servitude —were released.
The public has talked Rabaul and looting
so much that it is beginning to see a thief
in every khaki jacket. It is not fair to our
first Expeditionaries, nor to the Army at
large, nor to Australia, to leave the asper-
sions untouched —for these trials do not
touch them. Are there to be more Courts-
martial? Or shall a Royal Commission of
one or more Supreme Court Judges be ap-
pointed to sift the whole business? A Com-
mission, where it is instructed to inquire
into. a Tote which the Government never
intends to adopt, is a money-wasting super-
fluity. But for a Lands Scandal or a
Rabaul Uproar it is just the thing. It
would not squander the public’s money by
delving into the futile question of whether
an affluent colonel had been stealing a second-
hand salt-spoon. But it would concern
itself very earnestly with the other and larger
robberies that are said to have taken place;
it would have no professional or other inter-
est in hushing up such crimes, assuming
them to have been committed ; and it would
know, from long experience, the quickest
and surest means of eliciting the needed
information from the right witnesses.
-♦
The “Permanent” Man.
After months of fretting inactivity, spent
in seaside forts with a good view of the
departing troopships, the Australian per-
manent soldier is at last to be given a
chance of seeing some real soldiering as
part of a siege train. It is a wise move
and will help materially to sweeten up a
service that was rapidly going sour for want
of recognition and encouragement. But
opening the official door to the Front is
only the beginning of the good work. The
Australian professional soldier in the past
has had about as little official encourage-
ment as a warrior can exist on. Under the
peace-time regulations he gets no pension.
If he happens to have holiday leave due to
him when he dies, his grateful country will
hand the money equivalent of the holiday
to his sorrowing dependents ; otherwise there
is nothing but the gun carriage and the flag
and the last volley that buys no groceries
for the living. In the case of the lower
ranks the lopsidedness of the system is best
illustrated by the fact that a permanent
artilleryman draws 3s. 6d. a day and a ser-
geant ss. It takes six years at least for a
man to reach the rank of sergeant, and
various severe tests are applied to make
dead-sure that he is a fit and proper man.
A citizen gunner of no experience draws his
ss. a day right off. So much for the lower
grades. As regards the commissioned men,
their enthusiasm is nicely damped at inter-
vals by seeing the good appointments
handed to semi-amateurs. There have
even ; been cases when, on senior staff posi-
tions becoming vacant, retired officers have
been brought in to fill them. The badly-
paid enthusiasts have hung on partly be-
cause they don’t want to throw up the pro-
fession they know and like, and partly on
account of the hope that never dies. The
present war, with its inevitable readjust-
ments, will give the Defence Department a
chance to put things on a better working
basis. It is a big job, but the future
security* of Australia may depend on it —
and Australia is a fairly big stake.
——
Boots.
In 1910 the boot and shoe factories of Aus-
tralia turned out coverings for 11,618,000
pairs of feet. In 1913 they provided hiding
places for only 11,135,000 pairs, and gave
employment to 610 fewer people. On the
other hand, since 1909 there has been a
steady increase in the proportion of imported
footwear, the advance being 148.8 per cent.
These figures don’t suggest any leaping and
bounding by local enterprise; and the Inter-
State Commission, which last week addressed
a long sermon about boots to the Federal Par-
liament, can’t suggest a way to make the
industry leap or bound worth tuppence. The
best it can do is to throw the statistics up in
the air and say they are not what they look.
The Commission, therefore, solemnly recom-
mends that, as Australian makers hold the
market for most lines of boots, and as in
some lines they are “unable to compete”
with the imported article, there should be an
increase of duties all round amounting to
5 per cent. —an increase which, on the Com-
mission’s own showing, is not required on
.certain lines, and on other lines will be about
as effective as a pinch of salt. It proposes,
further, that duties designed to protect the
leather industry should be thrown overboard
in order that boot manufacturers may get their
material at bedrock prices by paying freight
for an unnecessary 25,000 miles of sea-car-
riage. The making of glac6 kid in Aus-
tralia the Commission recommends for imme-
diate execution, the other tanning concerns to'
receive a certain indefinite consideration in
the form of bounties. The net conclusions
of the report therefore appear, to be: (4 )
That the Commonwealth should unnecessarily
increase the duty on boots which are never
imported ; (2) that it should not make the
boots which now undersell local goods; (j 3)
that it ought to encourage the export of hhjles
and the import of leather, because hides can
be turned into the finished material a|nd
pulled across the ocean more cheaply than
they can be altered in aspect at home. All
of which is a recrudescence of the weary bid
stuff the public skips in the Freetrade dailies
and is in violent opposition to the national
policy. How much longer the country is to
go on paying through the nose for Freetrade
lectures seems to require some explanation,
even though Minister for Customs Tudor has
been demonstratively cheering the “general
principles” laid down by the Commission in
its first memorandum. From exploded Free-
trade brochures at three a shilling the Legis-
lature could learn all that these Commis-
sioners are teaching for some thousands a
year.

The Strategist of Market-street.
Sydney Evening News recently disclosed
the typical Geebung’s notion of a strategic
railway for all Australia. What the News
wants is “a railway that will run from
somewhere where there are people to some-
where where there are others.” For
example, from Bondi to Hunter’s Hill, or
from Market-street to La Perouse. The
idea of spending money on what the News
calls “the absurd North to South trans-
continental” is revolting to the Geebung
intellect. What is the use?
We never believed very much in the invasion theory
anyhow, and could never understand, in spite of all
the pundits, why the enemy should be expected to
invade Port Darwin. We have always contended, in
face of the Port Darwin invasion obsession, that a
sane enemy, possessing the sea power and the neces-
sary military force, would not skulk round at Darwin
or any other back-door, but would come straight at
the richest and most populated parts.
The News didn’t believe in compulsory ser-
vice either. It was also an embittered critic
of the Australian Navy scheme. It re-
garded a local fleet as the obsession of fools,
and it contended that Australians had
neither the capacity to handle a warship
nor sufficient character to submit to naval
discipline. Only now, when compulsory ser-
vice has justified itself, and when the Aus-
tralian navy has served to protect the
News office from being shelled to fragments,
does the paper relapse into gloomy silence.
But it can’t remain wholly dumb when
there is something reactionary in the naval
or military line to advocate. So we have it
saying precisely the same things about the
transcontinental —that it is unnecessary,
and too expensive, and a tactical error —as
it said, up to the very edge of the war, about
our navy. Geebung-like it sees the entire
world in relation to Sydney and environs.
It cannot believe that any enemy, even an
Asiatic one, would elect to occupy the
North of Australia without a struggle, when
by merely transporting his troops for an
additional three weeks’ journey, round one
of the most treacherous and poorly lighted
coasts in this hemisphere, he might, after
running the gauntlet of the local fleet and
its mines and sundries, get a chance, to
engage the defences of Sydney. A Society
for the Promulgation of the Great Truth
that Sydney is Not the Earth is badly
needed in places like the News office. The
facts of the case, as regards the defence
aspect of the North-South railway, are
these. Any Asiatic invader will inevitably
go to Darwin first, assuming that Darwin is
still unprotected when war start's. To
begin with it is nearest to the colored North
—and every mile saved is a consideration
when troops are being transported. And
in the second place, it is as desirable to
(say) the Chinese as any other part.of the
Commonwealth. The News might—in fact
probably would —receive with indifference
the information that a horde of Chinese
bad arrived in the Territory and was estab-
lishing itself there, till such time as it could
push farther south. In fact, the News,
having no White Australia principles to
speak of. would regard the event, probably,
as a happy solution of the dear labor pro-
blem. But that does not represent the
attitude of Australia. Australia is anxious
to join up the South Australian railway
system with Port Darwin for at least two
good Defence reasons. One is that the
North requires to be in a position to resist
penetration, peaceful or otherwise, on the
part of aliens. The other is that the North
needs the white population which alone can
justify its permanent retention by the
Commonwealth. The big railway may not
pay unite so well at the start as the
dream-line running from “somewhere where
there are people to somewhere where there
are others.” But it would be a mighty
immigration agent; and that is worth, tons
of axle grease, since if we don’t eet immi-
gration to the North we cannot hold it.

A Holocaust and Some Fools.
The Lusitania tragedy was distinguished
by some masterpieces of criminal fat-headed-
ness on the part of those in high places.
Take first the captain.
When leaving New York he laughed at the German
threats. Replying to them he said: “We are too fast
for them.”
Afterwards, though “50 anonymous tele-
grams were received by wealthy Americans
aboard the liner,” and though Germans
assembled at the docks and passed round
warning messages, the skipper remained
imperturbed. He didn’t think such an accu-
mulation of evidence worth bothering about.
The type is common enough. It is British
to the marrow. It has done something to
make the Empire what it is.; it has done
more to cause disaster, national humilia-
tion and death. In this case the captain,
strong in his contempt for the squareheads,
didn’t even condescend to deviate from
his usual course. Had he done so
the waiting murderer would at least
have had to go forth and find him,
in which case the liner might, first
have found the submarine. As it was
the Lusitania played the part of the sitting
fowl. It didn’t have a sporting chance. The
enemy could hardly miss it. The other
blameworthy parties (assuming that the
vessel’s £150,000 worth of cargo, or any of
it, consisted of contraband) are the British
owners and" the TJ.S.A. consignors. We
and the rest of the world know that the
TJ.S. are supplying the Allies with arms,
ammunition, tinned meat, sweaters, boots,
shirts and other articles for the use of the
soldiers. What we .haven’t. troubled to
ascertain, i'g the shipping lines which are
carrying ;the goods. It may be taken for
granted: that the Germans have. It is their
business' to know such; things. Battle after
battle , has ‘been lost in this war owing to
lack of ammunition on one side or the other.
Only last week, on the Dunajec. in Galicia—
the Russian artillery made amazingly good practice
until, towards the end, it became weak owing to the
lack of ammunition.
In such circumstances a cargo of shells
might be as well worth sinking as a ship
full of soldiers. To despatch contraband
aboard a big liner looks’oil "the surface like
a good move from the standpoint of the
consignor. Against an ordinary enemy the
vast passenger list would act as the best
insurance on the safe delivery of the goods.
The same consideration might incline a firm
of shippers to carry the dangerous wares.
Their notion would be that, while the Ger-
mans might not hesitate to sink an obscure
tramp and drown its inhabitants, they
would think several times before sending
thousands of influential citizens of all
nationalities to their doom. This is where
the idiocy of the consignors and shipping
directors came in. That the Germans are
indifferent to human life _ and human
decency has become axiomatic._ They are
prepared to commit any atrocities in order
to win. But they remain business men.
They are not going to waste torpedoes, risk
submarines, and gain the execration of civi-
lisation for the mere joy of profitless assas-
sination. Whether there was contraband
aboard the Lusitania or not it may be
taken as read that the Germans thought
there was. If they were correct the passen-
gers should have been told so when the
first warnings came to hand. If they were
wrong, facilities should have been given to
some of the big pro-German gang in New
York to satisfy themselves on the point, and
save their countrymen from the stigma of a
hideous and also superfluous crime. The
horror has a personal interest .to the Com-
monwealth, inasmuch as it may be re-
peated any day in the case of one of the
big liners which trade there, The German
navy being what it is, the first point on
which the peace-loving passenger has a
right to be satisfied is that the co.
he patronises is not confusing its tourist
and blockade-running departments.
Why the Tub Runs Dry.
Tiie scarcity of water in some of Sydney’s
suburbs, which is a regular feature of most
summers, has roused certain municipalities to
such fury of indignant zeal that they are
demanding a Royal Commission to look into
the matter. This is the. sort of thing a very
angry municipal council generally does de-
mand. It has a pathetic faith in the Com-
mission, and doesn’t seem to realise that
when the Royal article puts on its moleskins
and gets to alleged work it is only out for
a highly-paid picnic. The absence of the
water is plain enough, and the reason of its
absence is the congestion policy by which
Sydney continues to overgrow at the expense
of nearly every other town and district in
the State. It requires no Commission to
elicit this information, but it is not the sort
of information which is palatable to muni-
cipal mayors and the like. Congestion
means muddle, and muddle means a great lot
of inconveniences like shortage of water
when it is most needed, awful streets and in-
adequate local train and tram services. What
the municipal muddlers want the Commis-
sion to do is to present a report on the
other muddlers who control the moisture, set-
ting forth that the reason the taps give no
water on washing day is not the obvious
one, but something else. However the issue
may be clouded, the plain fact stands
that the way to get order out of
the present chaos is to drive piles and lay
bricks at Port Stephens and other places.
But this might reduce the value of suburban
property, and the fly-spot municipalities
whose business it is to make mudholes for
the citizens to get bogged in would rather
suffer perpetual thirst than see a diminu-
tion in the number of stucco fronts con-
structed about their goat tracks.

Why Not a Sugar Seizure?
N. S. Wales recently brought off a very
successful wheat seizure or steal. The High
Court was appealed to, but it upheld the ac-
tion of the Holman Government, on the
ground that each State is supreme in matters
of trade and commerce within its own bor-
ders. Now a sugar crisis is threatening.
Sugar is going to be shorter during the
next few weeks than wheat ever was or is
likely to be in N. S. Wales. Even when these
few weeks are past supplies will be very
meagre, for the Queensland crop will be
largely a failure. That being so, what if
Queensland follows the example of N. S.
Wales and collars all its sugar for its own
use? It is true that Bananaland has but one
refinery. But that will go a long way, and
unrefined sugar is as good as refined for
most purposes; moreover, an Administration
out to save its electors from being exploited
in connection with a commodity which enters
into the composition of scores of necessaries
would not stick at a little thing like Social-
istic sugar-refining. The experiment would
go down well with both political parties —the
Liberals regarding it as a vindication of the
grand old State Rights principle, and the
Laborites accepting it as a testimony to the
merits of Sosh. There is a certain amount
of comic justice in the fact that if all the
other States started in the same way to
exercise their legal rights in a manner inimi-
cal to the Commonwealth at large, N. S.
Wales, which first put the idea into prac-
tice, would be about the worst sufferer. Take
beer. The Mother State, although it has
three of the biggest breweries in Australia,
produces little or none of the articles from
which beer is made. The hops and barley
come from the South; the sugar largely from
the North. A beer-famine in the name of
State Rights might do more to win an
affirmative answer to the Referenda questions
from earnest Geebungs than much speechi-
fying by W. M. Hughes. The beer question
aside, it is necessary only for Queensland to
exercise its undoubted rights and the electors
of Australia will soon appreciate the prepos-
terous system under which they are living.
They pay £1,250,000 per annum to an in-
dustry which may supply them with this
prime necessary of life so long as suits the
State on which it mostly depends. If Queens-
land gets a sudden attack of State. Spites,
as any State is liable to dq, the whole of Aus-
tralia, with the exception of the State in
question, must go short. It is not an argu-
ment against the protection of white-grown
sugar. But it is a very powerful one
against that clause of the Constitution which
allows any State to trade as it likes within
its own borders, and regardless of the inter-
ests of its neighbors, while drawing- from
those neighbors all sorts of tariff, defence and
other benefits
Victoria's new Court of Criminal Appeal,
constituted in the teeth of judicial opposi-
tion, demonstrated at its first sitting that
the liberty of a person charged with a
criminal offence is still of less importance
than a question of ancient lights or a civil
case involving £27 9s. 3d. Of the three
Judges who sat to hear the first appeal, two
had previously dealt with the charge and
indicated pretty clearly their opinions. The
accused woman was first tried in the Crim-
inal Court before Justice a’Beckett ; but
the jury disagreed, whereupon a second trial
took place, before Justice Hood, and there
was a conviction. The grounds of the appeal
were that evidence had been wrongfully ad-
mitted, and the jury not properly directed ;
and the Bench that was asked to declare these
allegations correct was composed _of Hood
and a’Beckett themselves and their learned
brother Madden. Counsel urged that the
case should be heard by five horsehairs (the
Act provides for either three or five), but
the request was turned down. In Victorian
civil appeals the Judge who heard the case
never sits at the appeal, and, in fairness to
the appellant, in a criminal case the court
should be so constituted that at least a
majority of the Bench may approach the
case free from preconceived opinions about
it. An appeal to three Judges, two
of whom have already furnished their
opinion of the matter, clearly fails
to give the appellant a sporting chance;
and where his liberty is at stake,
a sporting chance is the very least anybody
has a right to demand. It was the recogni-
tion of this that brought the Court of Crim-
inal Appeal into existence.
The rash of the importing disease broke out
in a fresh place when the Premiers’ Confer-
ence passed a resolution in favjor of indent-
ing “two leading railway expej-ts from out-
side Australia” to consider, report on and
advise upon the unifying of the national rail-
ways. The thing has been considered and
reported on many times. Unification of
gauge appears on the platform of all political
parties. It is admitted to be of the most
pressing importance. But because various
persons are too tired, and too parochial, the
problem is consistently dodged. And now
Australia is to be asked to fee a couple of
total strangers to say something men on the
spot are thoroughly qualified to explain, in
order that the dodgery may at least look less
shameless to the multitude. The Australian
shirkers’ traditional device is to
port an expert. Still, as the Com-
monwealth has just been told by a
Commissioner that the importing of military
experts had been carried _ on to the
point of being a scandal, this latest move
would look less shabbily unpatriotic if it
were postponed for a day or two at least.
The headquarters staff of the shindykit
having arrived in Sydney, a precis of the
Norton Griffiths contract was produced
the other day for inspection. The arrange-
ment so far as can be seen from the docu-
ment is on the lines already revealed and
endorsed by the P.L.L. It indicates that
Private Enterprise goes in to hit up divi-
dends on a wicket prepared with scrupulous
care. The plan is that the syndicate shall
help to borrow £10,000,000 for N. S. Wales
and start with a rake-off from that little
lot in the shape of underwriters’ commis-
sion ; that it shall then come and spend the
cash in carrying out certain works and get
more commission on the cost; that it shall
have the use of State plant and machinery,
but if further equipment is wanted it may
acquire the same and get some more com-
mission for doing it. The alleged safeguard
is that if the Government considers any
particular work is costing too much it may
“stop it.” But of course that means noth-
ing. Apart from the fact that the syndicate
will already have the underwriting commis-
sion and the commission on. the purchase
of equipment in its pocket, it is to be re-
membered that this grotesque agreement is
made avowedly “to provide employment”;
so what chance is there of this Government
oi dering a job to cease because the men are
not sweating enouvh at it?

From an Australian in the Argentine:—
It is reported that Australia is taking some heavy
consignments of wheat from this part of the world
for milling. If the wheat reaches Australia it should
be somebody’s business to see that the grain is used
for no other purpose; otherwise the Backbone of Aus-
tralia will find itself with a few more imported curses
on hand. The Argentine farmer’s wheatfield is gener-
ally as full of noxious weeds as his cattle are of foot-
and-mouth disease and his sheep of scab. He has so
many virulent plagues to contend with that a wheat-
crop which is 50 per cent, thistle doesn’t matter.
Maoriland, I remember, got its worst weed-curse in
imported grain after a drought; so did (he N. S.
AVales Riverina. It is therefore up to Australia to
view Argentine wheat with a very frigid eye. It
would be far better to let a few thousand acres go
uncropped for a year than to sow it with all the
plagues of the River Plate.

The suggestion to establish a Bureau of War
Invention, financed in Australia but located
in England, has a spot of decay in it from
the start. There never was a country that
treated its inventors quite so carelessly as
Britain, or where practical discoveries were
so long in being taken up and turned to their
best use. Looking fairly at the question, it
seems tolerably certain that Australian in-
ventions, perfected in Australia and endorsed
by a recognised Bureau in the Common-
wealth, would have a far better chance of
immediate acceptance and use than if sent
in their raw form to Britain to be pigeon-
holed and reported upon there. Australia
is pretty certain to have a war of her own
within measurable distance of time, or if she
doesn’t it will only be because she is so well
prepared, that a campaign against her doesn’t
promise more than funeral expenses for the
invader. Towards such preparation a
Bureau of Invention, located on our own
soil, and using the best Australian brains,
would be a tolerably big step. We want in-
ventions of a kind which our possible enemies
ho not possess, and our best chance of hav-
ing them is to grow them at home.

The Spread of Armageddon.
Though they made desperate efforts to avoid
having to do such a thing, it appeared at the
beginning of the week as if the Germans
would have to write a new “Hymn of Hate,”
or else amplify the original dirge to include
Italy. Circumstantial stories were then
being published of Italian armies hurrying
to the northern frontier, of shots alr'eady
exchanged, of direful threats telegraphed
trom Berlin to the one-time ally of the Hun.
It Italy does join Britain, France and
Russia, the Prussian militarists will cer-
tainly be moved to extra bitterness, for the
step will not only greatly alter the military
aspect of affairs, but also be an embarrass-
ing revelation to the German people of diplo-
matic failure. From the confused accounts
ot recent happenings in Italy it appears that
against th 6 nation’s horoditary enemy
in the North is popularly regarded
u . ° nly alternative to an isola-
tion infinitely more perilous, since by
standing at ease on the outskirts of
things the best that could be obtained from
the Germans would be a scrap of paper in
the present and a smack in the eye when the
time came to honor it. Therefore the Italian
populace reckons that if the much-desired
territorial bacon is to be landed at all, it
can only be secured on the end of a bayonet.
Meanwhile, away from this cloud of words,
the mighty conflict of arms rages with in-
creasing fury. - Each day brings news of
terrible carnage, of victories dearly won, of
gigantic battles, of bloodshed on a scale too
giuat almost for the human mind to grasp.
In Flartders fighting has been continuous for
several weeks, the result so far being a dis-
tinct encouragement to hope for something
more than isolated triumphs. On the East-
ern front the Russians are still hard at it.
and appear to be checking a grave danger
which for the second time during the cam-
paign threatened their left wing. Of her
own lads Australia hears no more than an
occasional distant whisper, but such informa-
tion as does reach the homeland shows that,
while the Turk is stubbornly resisting, Bill
and Jim are valiantly helping to shove him
back. The casualty lists trickling slowly
through reveal to some extent how fierce the
contest has been ; and maybe the character
of the struggle to join hands with Ivan
across the Bosphorus is yet to be more clearly
disclosed. During the week President Wil-
son forwarded a note to Germany about the
sinking of the Lusitania. If the Kaiser and
von Tirpitz persist in asserting the inalien-
able right of Prussians to blow up inoffensive
Yanks, the President gives them to under-
stand that he will say something quite
rude.

“Personnel” : Soon we will have on top
of us our wounded and sick from the Darda-
nelles, and it is high time someone devised
a scheme for looking after them. The Medi-
cal side of the Department of Defence has
apparently forgotten that many nurses will
be required—apparently no provision has
yet been made to meet this emergency. There
are ladies who were formerly trained nurses,
now wives and mothers, who would gladly
give their services to impart instruction in
nursing. Numbers of bur women of leisure
would be glad to attend these classes and
learn the art and something of the practice,
so that later they might be able to assist
in caring for the sick and the wounded.
A start should be made quickly. We shall
certain, sooner or later have to do
something, because our supply of trained
women has been so heavily drawn upon for
foreign service.
The German vote in the United States is
a big thing. Roosevelt’s troubles! He
wouldn’t get it, anyhow. It was Roosevelt
who took the lid off the Sugar Trust, mostly
a German affair, and invited the Courts to
notice the combine’s systematised swindling
of the Customs. The German sugar men
pursued him after that with bitter hate, and
were powerful influences in securing his de-
feat. “Teddy” now has a chance to get
some of his own back, and he is after it.
Colonel Abbott, the Liberal M.P. who was
farewelled in several places last week, had
luck with his regiment—the 12th Light
Horse. He took it over ready-made from
the skilled hands of Major Baker, D-S.O.
It is one of the-most unusual cavalry regi-
ments in the world. About 75 per cent, of
the troopers are richer than their officers.
A couple of them are worth over £50,000,
scores have properties valued at £5OOO and
upwards, and there are many sons of big
N. S. Wales and Queensland squatters who
a year ago would readily have laid a thou-
sand to one against the chance of their
wearing dungarees at Holdsworthy before
the middle of 1015. Colonel Abbott suits
them well. He has lived in the Backblocks
most of his life. He is a sound horse-master.
He looks like an actor and talks like a book.
If the Liberal party is concealing any more
of his stamp it should let them go without a
moment’s delay.

“Cinderella” goes and the much-discussed
Gilsullivan co. returns to Her Majesty’s
(Sydney) at this week-end. There won’t,
however, be time to work up any violent feuds
as to whether this really is the poorest
Gilbert and Sullivan co. that ever came into
the Pacific. There is to be a swift three-
niglit season of “The Gondoliers”; then three
nights of “lolanthe.” After that surely “The
Yeomen o' the Guard,” though so far it isn’t
mentioned.

Walter Bentley and, his Beerbohm Trees
and Ethel Irvings presented a full menu at
the Sydney Repertory Theatre on Friday,
half the takings at the cash register to go
to the Belgian Fund. The main fish course
was “Cromwell’s Justice,” which was mostly
Bentley, _ and very palatable Bentley at
that, witlp Miss Ida Gough as a good
sauce. The chief joint, “Money,” proved
a tough proposition, and was respon-
sible for more or less indigestion.

big turns will, however, continue to make
the show worth while even when Julius is

At the Imperial Salon de Luxe (Sydney)
the motto is “Dancing as Usual.” The
after-theatre supper nights, so popular last
season, have been revived, and the first of
them, last Friday, cheered up everybody,
including the manager.
At Her Majesty’s (Melb.) “The Marriage
Market” takes up the running from the
fairly exhausted “Jinks” on Saturday. The
imminent musical comedy will come new to
this continent, and its title should appeal
strongly to the sex which is born to be on
the market in question. Two recently-
arrived ladies —Ethel Cadman and Thelma
Raye—are making their first appearances
in the alleged novelty from America, and
the co. otherwise will be different from the
crowd that moves on after Friday.

“IN OLD DONEGAL,” AT THE
SYDNEY PALACE.
Allen Doone sings “ The Tunes We Love to Hear
on Paddy's Day."
Apparently the two conspirators, Leah Van
Zalma and Gordon Canterville, wreak their
vengeance on the matron, Lady Eirene
Mount-Arliston, in return for sundry rebuffs
received. In the first place Eirene marries
Leah’s particular mash, and ruins the effect
of the heavy payments which that designing
female'had made to the young noble’s mother
as a Sort of deposit on the title. ' Secondly,
the heroine damages the vanity of the sultry
Canterville by ignoring the curl in his
canoodling arm when he attacks her virtue
in a rural retreat. For those reasons Eirene
is entrapped by appointment in the embrace
of Canterville, and her propriety is con-
demned to blush in the sight of her horrified
husband, who promptly divorces her without
the option of an explanation. After that
the loss of her twin offspring adds tenfold
to her agony; but she miraculously recovers
her property at the feet of a churfch
Madonna, and interposes successfully when
her preposterous lord and the awful Leah
are almost in the throes of another wedding
ceremony. Subsequently Miss Van Zalma
gets her deserts, and Canterville, punctured
by a bullet, is emptied over a precipice and
provides a bashed finale to a tableau of
Alpine grandeur. The heaviest part in the
play is Lord Mount-Arliston, in whom
George Cross sees a solemn apostle of social
decorum, passionately addicted to suiting
his clobber to the various changes of climate
which scenic-artist Mann so thoughtfully
provides. Miss Vera Remee as Eirene repre-
sents the tortured Marriage Tie dragged by
the scruff of the neck through 13 scenes of
woe. Miss Jean Robertson as the furious
Leah is a dressmaker’s gibe at the Decalogue,
while Canterville, in the opinion of Ronald
Riley, is a nervous and furtive rubber-neck
whose dreams are filled with detectives. An
attenuated tabby, the Dowager Lady Harriet
Mount-Arliston, is more or less represented
by Miss Oriel Hotson, who obviously fails
to make a hobby of the part; while the hard-
working Ward Lyons is a piece of human
garbage thrown up intermittently on the
body of the dialogue. As for the nippers
who picture the awful precocity of Lady
Eirene’s infants, they ought to be sent home
to bed.

The Steele-Payne Entertainers, who are
putting in four weeks at the Auditorium,
Melbourne, deal chiefly with those odd and
ornamental instruments of music which re-
quire to be opportunely shaken, or else
beaten with a drumstick. They need also
to be assisted in some cases by a violin,
cornet and piano in the orchestra below the
stage, and, generally speaking, the perform-
ances are more pleasing than remarkable.
Sundry singing items by nice girls; which
break the monotony of the clever liandbell
ringing, sleigh bell ringing, and kindred
works of “applied art,” are also a bit bour-
geois, whereas the lean and lissome dancing
comedian, Athol Tier, would be a good
humorous turn at any vaudeville show. The
Steele-Paynes dress prettily and change their
garments freely, and a crowded house on the
first night received them in a cordial manner.
A spice of wickedness in the entertainment
might further commend it to some people’s
taste, but the presence of two or three hymn
tunes forbids the introduction of ungodly
matter.

r “O.JL”: The law trouble concerning
Nordica’s will reminds one of how R. S.
Smythe tried in vain to get the ’Murkan
i;rima donna to this hemisphere. He was
in Chicago for the World’s Fair, and inter-
viewed the lady about an Australasian tour.
He talked of its wonders, beauties and
profits, and the wealthy songstress ap-
peared to be making up her mind
to accept his terms. At last she crushed his
hopes with: “Well, Mr. Smythe, I believe
all you say about the Sunny South ; but I
think I’m hardly old enough for Australia.”
That was a complete He couldn’t
try to convince the lady that she was already
more than old enough—over-ripe rather than
under ripe. So the' interview closed. When
at last Nordica did come to Australia her
voice was but a feeble suggestion of its
past and R. S. Smythe had retired from
business. Her tour profited nobody except
the lawyers, who are discussing the Thurs-
day Island document and will get lovely
costs from the estate.
.Fred Niblo, the slick patter comedian, is
said to have yearnings for “sentimental”
parts wherein he could thrill the hearts of
lovesick maidens and draw a tear from
every eye. But judging from his way of
talking to the _ “some girl” he invariably
adores at first sight on the farcical comedy
stage, Niblo hasn’t a notion of theatrical
poetic effects in manner, pose or voice in-
flection. When he tries to be sentimental
he becomes mushy. His love-making would
convince “some girl”-—any sort of love-mak-
ing will do it if she is that way disposed—
but he never persuades the audience that he
is in earnest about anything save his busi-
ness as a showman specialist.
“E.T.”: Arthur Shirley, the Australian
actor, isn’t identical with Arthur Shirley,
part-author of “Tommy Atkins” (B.
13/5/’ls>. There are two Arthurs with the
same surname. They are not even related,
though Arthur Shirley, the English bellow-
dramatist, is old enough to be the author of
Arthur Shirley, the actor.
“Private Boxer”: That incorrigible Shaw
apologist, “Harrison 0.,” is at it again. In
his latest manifesto (B. 6/5/T5) he
graciously approves of Barrie adopting “the
Shaw method of describing his scenes and
characters in a chatty, amusing manner.”
(Barrie is, of course, slyly burlesquing
Shaw’s method, but that is a detail.) “When
a play is printed to be read,” we are sen-
tentiously informed, “its author should try
to make its scenes and characters as vivid
as they would be in a theatre.” This can
only be brought about, if I understand
“Harrison O.” aright, by loading the text
with long, minute descriptions of the scenery
and incidents and characters at every turn;
in other words, interrupting the dialogue
and delaying the action of the piece as much
as possible. A nice chance any play—as a
play—gets under those conditions! If the
scenes and characters are not vivid in them-
selves, pages of preface and descriptions of
scenery and costumes will never make them
so, that’s certain. Such fairly successful
dramatists as Shakspeare, Molifire and Ibsen
managed to get along without any such
assistance, and they can still be read with
interest and amusement. Shaw is not a
Shakspeare, a Moli6re or an Ibsen —indeed,
he is far from being even a Pinero —and
he is quite aware of it. Hence his pre-
faces, his voluminous notes and his chatty
and amusing descriptions of every mortal
and immortal thing his pieces contain.
They serve to delight the “Harrison O.’s”
but they obscure the real issue.
“M.P.A.” talks of God’s largest four-
footed creatures: —
The death of Toby, Wirths’ big elephant, was due
to cancer, it seems ; and on the presumption that she
suffered internal agonies for years, the animal’s sins
may be forgiven her. My first introduction to Toby
was on board the Marama, off Invercargill (M.L.),
when she hit me a clout with her trunk that left me
black and blue for days. I subsequently found out
that a fool steward had given her a very hot mustard
sandwich, and as I happened to pass I got the reward
for the alleged joke. According to the school-book
jarn about the elephant and the tailor, Toby should
have waited for that steward; but from much experi-
ence with circus elephants I know that it is usually
a case of first come first served. Still, there are
cases on record where a patient, reasonable elephant
has carefully dealt it out to the chap who deserved
all he got.
Elephants are kittle-cattle. Of course, there are
good and bad, and the worst of the bad ones is the
“dope” elephant. Where there are a number of them
to deal with a showman is kept on the
jump. Hardly a day passes without some
exciting incident. To the townspeople the lum-
bering beasts are a great source of anxiety.
Horses go frantic when they are about, and for one to
drop dead in the street while holding up the shafts
of a cocky’s buggy is quite a common occurrence.
On the other hand, if a small, yapping poodle comes
near an elephant, the big, lurching brute will want
to bolt, If he does, nobody knows what won’t hap-
pen. On one occasion an elephant drawing a big,
empty waggon took fright at the exhaust report from
a gas engine, and was so dead scared that it ran
between a pair of small weatherboard cottages, got
jammed, burst the walls and caused a general smash
up of pictures, furniture, etc.
There is no doubt about the wonderful tricks they
can do with their trunks. Here’s an instance. Ele-
phants are fastened up by means of a chain and
shackle around one of their forelegs, the chain being
attached to an “anchor”-—a strong stake driven into
the earth. One artful little elephant found out the
way of it and got into the habit of unscrewing the
pin of the shackle. Then he would calmly go straight
for the horse feed, throw out any grooms who
obstructed his way, tear open a chaft' or bran bag,
and have a picnic. •
I remember once an experienced elephant-man was
doing a bit of cleaning up amongst the animals
when just-departed Toby picked him up, fork and all,
gave him a shake aloft in the air, and was just about
to bring the scared chap to the ground to stamp on
him when he was interrupted by his trainer —the only
person who could do very much with the monster.
The fellow who got the scare didn’t wait to give the
animal a second chance; he just packed up and
flitted. Toby had several deaths to her discredit. I
saw one poor chap die after being crushed by a
terrible bump from the animal’s head. Toby cleared
for her life, knowing quite well she had done wrong.
“Empress,” a big “dope” elephant that belonged to
Sells Bros.’ show, had a record of 22 deaths. A
“dope” is a drug or preparation which has the effect
of keeping the animal on reasonable terms with itself.
As long as it has its “dope” it won’t be unruly. But
should it fail to be “doped” at the prescribed time
it will break things. Should anything happen to the
trainer who holds the secret of the “dopej” the only
safe thing to do is to destroy the brute. I had
several encounters with a small Jumbo, with tusks
like a hay-rake. He would make for the bales of
hay and break them with his head and foot. I inter-
rupted his scheme on one occasion, and he imme-
diately charged me. Fortunately I was close to a big
animal cage, and with a standing leap I got beyond
my enemy’s reach. The same animal often struck a
horse, and many a groom narrowly escaped with his
life.
A man brought his small son to see the show,
and while walking around the menagerie tent before
entering the big “top” unconsciously pointed to some-
thing with the tickets he held in his hand. One of
the elephants reached out and collared the tickets
and swallowed them. The poor fellow was at first
refused admission to the performing tent; the man-
agement regarded his story of the swallowed tickets
as a bit over the odds. But subsequently the ticket-
seller identified the father and son as having pur-
chased tickets, and they were passed through into the
show. It is a very unusual thing, though, for a
spectator at the show or in the street to be injured
or in any way interfered with by an elephant. It is
the men on the show that take the chances. True,
one of Fitzgerald Bros.’ elephants—Lizzie, by name—
picked up a pressman, silk hat* walking-stick and
all, and waved him aloft. The man in question—it
was the lte Carew Reynell—was just saved by the
intervention of one of the circus hands, The ele-
phant usually received sweeties from its silk-hatted
acquaintance, but on this occasion there were no
sweeties forthcoming, and Reynell at last pushed the
pertinacious Lizzie’s trunk away from his shoulder.
But Lizzie wasn’t a lady to take a jilting like that..
“Melb”: J. 0. Williamson, Ltd., has fixed
up its cinema studio, system, on the
site for the Williamson x'layhouse, opposite
Her Majesty’s. It is a simple affair, just
a wooden shed, with two sides and the roof
of glass. Of course there will be a lot of
open-air work in connection with nearly
every picture. The Williamson theatre site
is thus up-to-dated. It began with Rowe’s
Circus about 1853. Then followed Coppin’s
Olympic, the iron theatre, opened in 1855
with Brooke’s performances; and finally,
after many changes, the area was occupied
by Cole’s Bohemian Show.
“J.F.H.”: May an actress take her stock-
ings off on a brilliantly lighted stage in full
view of the audience? A few years ago the
English censor said no, and stopped such an
exhibition by a French actress. She was
compelled to do her disrobing behind a
screen. But in this matter, as in
others, we are moving. In “Dinner
for Eight,” just produced at the Am-
bassador’s Theatre, Sir Herbert Tree’s
daughter not only takes off her stockings in
the limelight, but leisurely puts on another
pair. This makes quite a scrumptious per-
formance. Stockings can be whisked off
pretty smartly, but putting them, on neces-
sarily presents piquant facilities for sus-
tained observation. Some Cockney wowsers
have been writing to the papers wanting to
know why what was improper in Delysia is
sanctioned in Tree. The only answer, of
course, is that what in one censor’s eyes is
art is in another’s immorality.
Fred Cambourne reckons he has been
associated with the Williamson management
longer than any other mummer playing
leading parts. Twenty-eight years is
Frederick’s score. His first engagement was
as Caderousse, in “Monte Cristo, Jun.,”
when Fred Leslie and Nellie Farren opened
here. Later, he supported Grattan Riggs,
Harry Paulton, Andrew Mack, the Broughs,
George Darrell. Jennie Lee and ’Tilda
Brune. And last of all, Knight and Niblo
mostly.
■'Norbell”: Owing to a little financial
disagreement with the mismanagement, Clar-
ence Buskem, the comedian, decided to leave
the Hyphen-Yowler Dramatic do. at Gad-
getville and battle back to Sydney. He
was adorning Poverty Point the other day
when Mr. Hyphen-Yowler himself turned
up. “Hullo!” exclaimed Mr. Buskem, “how
did you get back? Did you walk?” “Sir!”
said the outraged manager, “the HyDhen-
Yowler company never walks!” “No,”
concurred the comedian, “nor its blanks
ghost either!”
The N. S. Wales Public Instruction
Department recently applied to the Colonial
Office for some of the captured German guns
for the Sydney Technological Museum, but
was turned down, as the application was
considered premature. In any case Aus-
tralia doesn’t dote on war trophies. Certain
guns captured from the Boers by the Ist
Mounted Rifles and Bushmen were, on re-
quest, forwarded to N. S. Wales by Lord
Roberts as mementoes of the prowess of
those regiments during the S’African war.
Some little time ago they were discovered
by an officer, who went looking for them,
rusting on a scrap heap at the back of the
Garrison Hospital in Victoria Barracks,
Sydney.
From S. M. Herald of 12/5/’l5
When the German noticed that the Osterley was
not taking any notice of her signals she rah up
another string of bunting, the purport of which was,
“udder damaged by submarine; want immediate
assistance.’’
This confirms Australia’s worst suspicions.
The Germans are cows!
The Corsicans have a saying that a sheep
is the only animal which will not avenge
its dead. Evidently the saying was manu-
factured before Columbus discovered
America.
From Tuesday’s S. M. Herald :
After reading correspondence the President of the
Necessary Commodities Control Commission stated
that it was quite clear there had been an application
made.
Mr. Knox: I don’t care a button whether you call
it an application or not.
His Honor: Have you any objection to the Com-
mission inquiring into the profits made by the Com-
pany during the past few months?
Mr. Knox: I don’t think that matters.
His Honor: Pardon me, we have to do our business
in our own way.
Mr. Knox: I think the question quite futile and
totally unnecessary.
His Honor: I repeat the question.
Yet this was nothing to the old-world cour-
tesy with which Mr. Knox handled Justice
Gordon, of S. Aus., when that gentlemen pre-
sided over the Sugar Commission. It is inter-
esting to consider, by the way, what language
Australia’s Chief Insulter of Royal Com-
missioners would use about a mere laboring
man who imitated his attitude towards
Judges—and, through those Judges, towards
the cause of Law and Order.

SOCIETY
. “Bobstay” : The Australian Merchant Ser-
vice Guild is protesting against the use of
the word “skipper” in allusion to the master
of a sea-going vessel. “Skipper” is from
schipper,” the name the master of a Dutch
coaster goes by; and “skipper” is the name
approved by the British Board of Trade for
the master of a steam trawler. The N. S.
W ales imported trawlers are to have “skip-
pers” and “second hands,” instead of masters
and mates. The Guild is therefore horrified
at the idea of its members being mistaken
tor the_ chairmen of fishing boats. But why
not object, also, to the unauthorised use of
the word “captain”? All the Guild officials
are “captains,” though the word has no real
sanction in the mercantile maritime. The
person-in-charge of a ship is the master. In
the old days of Nelson the “captain” of a
frigate was the chief fighting rooster, the
navigating officer being the “master,” a quite
subordinate person. To-day the word “can-
tain” really belongs to the navy alone. Offi-
cial naval documents always refer to the
serang of a merchant vessel as the “master.”
Why not adopt “Boss” straight out, or would
that offend the chief steward?

The N. S. Wales Education Department
collected details concerning 9705 boys who
left the primary schools during 1914; and
the results ought to set a lot of people
thinking. Of the 9705 youngsters, 2467
Went further, and entered secondary schools
and colleges. Of the balance 1940 took to
pastoral and agricultural pursuits, 1185 to
trades, and 229 became miners ; while 1836
entered into what is vaguely called com-
mercial work, 1559 became laborers or mes-
sengers or took on other unskilled jobs, 332
entered the Post Office and railway services,
and 113 set out to study professions for
which a University or technical training is
unnecessary. Thus, 3354 boys, or about 35
in every 100, went into actually and directly
productive callings (“land,” “trade” and
“mining,” which assumes that all the trades
are productive), and the balance —65 in the
100 —are apparently seeking the job of get-
ting their living by taking a hand in jug-
gling the stuff the few produce, or giving
professional advice about it, or fixing up the
roads and rails along which goods must be
carried, or assisting in the carrying. The
figures are not final, certainly : a good many
youngsters may have a second thought
about their work in the future. But as
far as they go they make Australia look a
goed deal like a continent trying to bal-
ance itself on the thin nose of Cape York.
“Callan Park”
And' so the Jap-Chinese trouble is patched up. I
have no head, for' statecraft; but it seems to me a
pity. I had formed high hopes of the day when the
local Chinese would be enemy aliens. What a solu-
tion of the dear vegetable problem it would have
been!
In the Commonwealth there are 20,775 Chinese
(0.47 per cent, of the entire population). Ninety-
eight per cent, of them are vegetable gardeners and
thiev—well, if the Censor insists, nnsiness men. Each
Chow spends on his upkeep 7s. 1.!. per week, or,
roughly, £2O a year. He puts !;y for ultimate re-
moval to the land of his forefathers 355. per week—
viz., £9l a year. A small proportion of this goes
back to the community in the form of racecourse
losses and improvements to property, such as huts
made of kerosene-tins. Also, in the occasional pur-
chase of a spade or fork or vegetabl e- c urn -ma nu re
cart. Say, £6 per annum. Multiply 20,000 Chinese
by £B5 (£1,700,000), and you get an idea of the
sum which.. we contribute annually to Asia in the
form of high-priced vegetables.
Had Australia gone to- war with China I was pre-
pared to lay before the Government a comprehensive
scheme for giving the death-blow to the cabbage prob-
lem. Every market garden of importance would have
been a Concentration Camp, filled with happy
Chinese working at their chosen calling for the benefit
of the Empire. Those who did not know how to
market-garden when the war began could be taught.
In a little while we would have the whole 20,775 pro-
ducing vegetables at bedrock prices.
It may be said that their guards (one armed
guard to 60 men) would cost money. I would find
their pay and mess-allowance out of a saving effected
In the Chows’ personal expenses by cutting off their
opium, tobacco and picture-show money. Each
Chinese could be generously supplied with the best
of rice and pure spring water at ss. 6d. per week.
Under my arrangement cabbages which now sell at a
shilling would be tuppence.
When I think that every time I eat a leaf of
spinach I am doing my bit towards driving capital
to the tune of close on £2,000,000 a year out of the
Empire, I feel so wild that I could issue a declara-
tion of war againSthChina on my own.

“0.K.” : As things have turned opt, the
re-appointment of the Germanised Marshall
Hall to his old billet at the Melbourne Uni-
versify College of Music is a lamentable
circumstance. A loud barracker of yore
for the German in music, philosophy and
organisation, military and commercial, Mar-
shall Hall came back to Melbourne at the
time when his old gods had toppled off their
pedestals and his old pals were under a
cloud. He recalled to her former sphere of
action the wife of an ex-consul for Austria,
He engaged a German-blooded singing-
master and a Bohemian pianist to keep the
truculent Herr Scharf company, and he
delivered a foolish address to the effect that
the present war was due to a malformation
of national ideals in Europe. Then he
somehow bounced the Repertory Theatre
into staging that dismal tragedy, “The Tro-
jan Women,” the inducement being his offer
of incidental music composed by his blessed
self. The admitted effect of the production
was to call attention to the resemblance
between classical Greek methods and modern
Hun methods of dealing with a conquered
city and its inhabitants. Truly a delectable
moral lesson to set before the young men
and maidens of the University where M.
Hall, is pr es&or o Music . Himself, with
the modesty of his type, sat among the audi-
ence to enjoy the muffled sound of his own
dirges, and beside him sat Herr Scharf.
News of the Lusitania outrage had arrived
that morning; consequently the act of Mar-
shall Hall in bringing Scharf as his com-
panion was a challenge to anti-German feel-
ing. If he is guilty of any more of the
same sort of bravado it will be a fair thing
to ask if he is a fit and proper person to
hold a pedagogic position. The fitness of
Tate to rule the Education Department has
been rather absurdly auestioned on account
of his fondness for German Kultur. It
would be much more reasonable to question
the propriety of maintaining a German
faction on the University staff.
An accident long foreseen duly happened in
Richmond when one of Melbourne’s imported
motor-’buses, in swinging round a slow-going
horse vehicle, capsized and threw its 11) occu-
pants i n t o a confused mass of human being,
broken glass, woodwork and smashed-machin-
ery. Luckily nothing caught fire; but broken
limbs, contusions and abrasions* were plenti-
ful, and the conductor was picked up with a
fractured skull. The trouble with these ’buses
is that the upstairs passengers are seated
12ft. from the ground on a 4ft. 9in. wheel
base, and once their equilibrium is disturbed
they are half-way to the nearest hospital,

Adelaide is up against a problem in ethics,
Lewis Cohen, many times Mayor of
the village, led the successful assault
in the City, Council against the recent
close-the-pubs-at-six referendum. The same
Cohen was a candidate at the general
election (held at the same time as
the referendum), and he then pro-
raised that if elected he would support the
people’s vote on the liquor question, which-
ever w r ay it'went. Now Cold Tea points at
his conduct in the Council, and asks him
what he means by it. He replies tersely that
he wasn't elected, so all conditional guaran-
tees are withdrawn. Logically this is un-
assailable. A lover makes all kinds of noble
offers to a girl whom he wants to marry.■ He
might keep them all in due course; but it
would be rather startling to expect him to
carry them all through if she turned him
down and married somebody else,

MOTHER EARTH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The drums may beat and the trumpets call,
But the brave, gay armies I swallow them all.
Frontiers alter and kings decree
But the ultimate victory is with me.
No matter what flaunting standards wave,
The heroes’ goal. is the same—the grave?.
And one and all shall find lasting rest
In the cold, cold depths of my ancient breast.
Brave heart that beats, vain hope that burns,
It is but clay that to me returns —
Poor clay that clashes in frenzied strife
To gain the palm of the dream called Life.
The conqueror flushed with victory,
Like the grey-faced corpse, is marked for me.
Though he ride from a hundred battlefields,
At the end of it all to me he yields.
Patient I bide for my helpless prey;
Take the breath from his lips and your Caesar's
clay.
The drums may beat and the trumpets call,
But the brave, gay armies I swallow them all.

The remarkable improvement in the hair
that has so frequently and invariably been
reported following the use of a simple hair
remedy composed of loz. Lavona de Com-
posee, |dram Menthol Crystals and 3oz. Bay
Rum, has caused such widespread interest
and comment that many chemists now keep
it put up complete and ready for use under
the name of Lavona Hair Tonic. Its uni-
form success in destroyihg dandruff, stop-
ping falling hair, promoting hair growth,
and making thin, dry, brittle hair thick, soft,

THE AIR PATROL.
[For The Bulletin.]
“My friend writes that his son, of the R.N. Flying
Corps, left the Orkneys, on patrol duty, three months
ago, and has not been heard of since.”
Into the void you went, no vain word spoken;
On the controls only the hand-grip stern;
Only by whirring screw the silence broken.
Great deeds, or sudden end —there comes no token.
Hope lights no more her lamp for your return.
Lone, as an eagle through the wild storm sweeping,
Over your own loved isle, and sea, and shore,
On through the night your ceaseless vigil keeping,
Heedless of peril, dauntless, and unsleeping;
Now those you guarded watch for you no more.
We may not know, but love has subtle science
To clear the vision and behold your flight,
Bold in your skill’s unwavering reliance,
At storm or foeman breathing calm defiance,
Breasting, unmoved, the terrors of the night.
We may not know if sudden foes assailed you,
Or tempest-lash or lightning arrow fell,
Or, by mischance, the swerving pinions failed you ;
We only know your lion heart availed you,
In some dread moment, to acquit you well.
Majorca, SPAIN. JAMES LINDO-WEBB.
One hundred years ago this month Gov-
ernor and Mrs. Lachlan Macquarie com-
pleted a trip across the Blue Mountains
and back —the first Government House
party to ever do it. There was quite
cavalcade —Major Antill, Captain Cox, ex-
plorers Oxley and Evans, John Jamison,
J. T. Campbell and Dr. Redfern. Emu
Plains was the first camp; Springwood
(named by Macquarie) the next; and then
Blackheath, which was as far west as the
newly-made road staggered. Curiously the
party didn’t name or rename half a hundred
places after itself. There is Jamison Val-
ley ; but no other christening seems to have
been done.

The curious memorial to G. E. and J. H.
Angas, father and son, erected on North Ter-
race, Adelaide, by the present generation of
the family, is now complete. The green mar-
ble pillar (which this paper has already ad-
mired) stands under the heavy white marble
canopy (which it has already declined to
admire). Above the medallion portraits and
the bronze tablets of good deeds done by the
Angases there now stands a kind of golden
Argo in full sail, and on the steps outside
waits an enormous bronze angel, holding out
a palm-leaf. The general effect is striking;
but the memorial is more suited to a burial-
ground than a public thoroughfare.
“Harrison O.”:
Isn’t it time parsons
were * Warned offi-
cially that ; com-
pounding a felony
•or being an acces-
sory after the fact
are offences? One
cleric 1 knows of a
tote in Melbourne
doing an enormous
business, but de-
clines to give its
address. Another
has personal know-
ledge of a brilliantly-lit
Sydney hotel where
drunken infants are
served with liquor, but
will not disclose the name
of the licensee. A third
has visited foul opium
dens where white girls
are lured to destruction,
but will not even, hint
whether these houses are
in Wahroonga or Wool-
loomooloo. A fourth
could, mention the exact
location of a “camp of
evil” at , Broadmeadows,
but won’t. Now Bishop
Green, of Ballarat, who
has lately been making
some remarks anent the
Hohenzollerns, tells of a
letter he received from a
Germhun resident of
Shepparton, reproaching
his. Gaiter's for speaking
disrespectfully of Divine
William, and setting forth
some of the things that
will happen “when the
Germans take Australia.”
Said the Bishop: “I had
intended forwarding the
letter to the Minister for
Defence to ascertain
whether the writer was not a tit
subject to be interned.” But of course
he didn’t, and he won’t name the
writer either. The plain, unfrocked patriot
on receiving such an epistle would do. his
duty and let the authorities take care of
the potential murderer. But the .cleric’s
ingrained, love, >of mystery, and his aversion
to. anything like a plain statement backed
with .names and addresses, remain with him
even in a national crisis like the present.
“The Eighteenth” from a training camp:
Several thousand soldiers (most of whom hope to
return to Australia and use the franchise next elec-
tions), their mothers, grandmothers, sons, daughters,
wives and aunts, amounting to many more thousands,
would like to know what became of a resolution
agreed to unanimously by the last State Insects’
Conference, to the effect that men going to the Front
have free passage on the Socialistic railways of the
States. It appears to most of us in N.S.W. that
the Holman Government, or the Railway Commis-
sioners, or both, have turned dog on the promise.
Certain it is that it costs us 2s. return for a trip
from Liverpool to Sydney, where most of us have
our homes. In my own case it costs me 3s. lOd. in
fares to make a Sunday visit to my family, and that
bites so big a hole in my ss. a day that somebody
has to have a very light breakfast next morning.

That rugged peninsula at the Dardanelles
over which the Queen Elizabeth is tossing
tons of shrieking metal, and where men
from Burketown and Booligal are prodding
the slack-trousered Shirk to his last stand,
is linked forever with one of the biggest
names in Greek history. Miitiades bossed
those rugged hills on Europe’s frontier and
gained there the knowledge of Asia that
afterwards made the victory of Marathon
possible. The first big battle-test of the
Australians has happened on classic ground,
and if there is anything in the notion that
the shades of the past hover over the places
they knew and fought for, there ought to be
a solid mass of shadow giving ghostly cheers
as the Turks run for cover.
A South Australian Court has granted
probate of a will that most likely isn’t in
existence. After making his dispositions in
Adelaide,_ testator went to his country home
in a railway-carriage full of shearers of
one sort and another, accepted a drink from
them —and was dead to the world till next
day. As lie wrote just after: “They stole
my portmanteau and everything in it. The
will was in it, and other papers. They took
my overcoat and 3s. lOd. in money, and also
my rug. In fact, they took everything I
had —tobacco and everything else.” Then
came the romantic part. It may have been
the excitement, or it may have been the
drugged liquor; whatever it was, after
posting the letter he fell dead on the door-
step. The will \yas formally advertised for,
but naturally did not return. A careful
executor had, however, kept a copy, and
the Supreme Court let it go at that and
granted probate.

A bear that escaped from a show near
Prince’s Bridge in Melbourne the other day
created consternation across more than a
mile of country before he was captured. The
most inspiring sight was the way the gentle-
men of leisure in the Domain took to trees —
which, in the case of this particular brew of
bruin, was very like taking to the water to
escape from sharks. The coolest customer
the bear encountered was an infant in a per-
ambulator. The nurse fled madly, leaving
her charge to the mercy of the ravening
monster. Bear nuzzled Babe, and Babe hit
him on the nose with a rattle, chortling over
the arrival of a beautiful new “Teddy” !
This week’s ecclesiastical note: —
What Canterbury Convocation has just done is not
to canonise Charles I. for the first time, but to re-
insert his name in the Anglican calendar.. For some
200 years his name appeared therein; his “day” was
January 30, the date of his execution—regarded by
High Church Anglicans as martyrdom because, he
might have saved his neck by consenting to the sup-
pression of Anglicanism. A special form of service
was also provided for the day, and was bound up
with the Prayer Book, When the Georges came to
the throne, Convocation—the Parliament of the Angli-
can Church, which long ante-dates the Houses of the
two other estates of the realm, Lords and Commons—
was suppressed by the Crown, and it was not again
allowed to meet till the 60’s of last century. Shortly
before it again assembled the special form of service
for January 30 was cancelled by Order-in-Council at,
it was believed, Queen Victoria’s wish—she being in
sympathy with the Puritans, who regard Charles
and the modern High Churchmen as Papists in dis-
guise. Victoria was glad to take this smack at the
Stuarts, since many of their admirers openly termed
her a usurper, and claimed some Bavarian princess-
a far-off descendant of Charles 1., as rightful Queen
of England. The official printers took it upon them-
selves to go farther, and removed the name of Charles
from the calendar. The revision of the Anglican
Prayer Book, which is now being carried on by
Convocation, gives the opportunity to re-insert his
name. The proposals to amend the calendar of Saints
include the- addition of many other names, ranging
from John Wesley to Thomas Acquinas. As there
was never any legal authority for the omission of
Charles I.’s name, probably it will be restored; but
it is not yet by any means certain that the other
proposals will be effected, for York Convocation has
yet to agree, and then there will be need of Crown
sanction, either by Order-in-Council or by direct
Parliamentary concurrence, before the changes become
legal. It is not generally known, by the way, that
the cult of Charles I. has its devotees in Australia
also. A “requiem Mass” was offered for the “Royal
Martyr in at least one Sydney Anglican Church on
January 30 this year.

When the Kaiser went mad he cried
Havoc and let slip the hogs of war.
“Blue Peter” : All the elements are present
for more row between the 25 first-class pilots
in the service of the N.S.W. Government and
their employers. When war first broke out
an examination service was inaugurated at
all “defended” ports, including Sydney and
Newcastle. The first-class pilots were ap-
pointed examination" officers at 16s. 6d. a
day. These pilots receive from £4OO to
£5OO a year in salary, and the Common-
wealth pay meant another £3OO a year or
so. When Minister Hoyle heard of the
arrangement he demanded to know what a
lot of sailors meant by this affluence, and
ordered the pilots to pay their extra, money
to him. When they refused, he deducted
an amount equal to the Commonwealth pay
from their screws. The enraged mariners
immediately hauled on every rope available
to. shift Hoyle , from his official attitude, but
without success. At the ' Premiers’ Con-
ference, Holman, titular head of the
Port Jackson pilot service, was knocked
bandy by a motion tabled by Peacock (Vic.)
demanding that N.S.W. should deal with her
pilots as other States had done. The motion
was carried almost without debate, and the
pilots sent in their claims anew. When
Hoyle was notified of this last move he went
off like a cyclone, and told the pilots to go
up the spanker or down the bilge, or any-
where they liked out of sight. Thereupon
the pilots threatened Hoyle with a Supreme
Court action, and Hoyle threatened the
whole 25 with the sack. Now there are
rumors of a strike, but unfortunately for the
pilots they, as naval examination officers,
are on active service, and if they knock off
work are liable to court-martial. Sd at
present it looks like a victory for Hoyle.
More inconveniences of war. Mary Kyley,
a frequent visitor at Melbourne police court,
complained last week: “It’s all because of
this prejudice against drink excited by the
war, your Worship. A lady can’t appear
drunk on the street now without provoking
.ccmment.”


THE GNAT AND THE CAMEL.
in the House of Reps., Anstey, M.H.R., declared that he had proof of “wholesale looting” by officers and men at Rabaul. Whereupon a court-martial
was held in Sydney to try a major on a charge of stealing a second-hand saltspo on, which had been taken from a captured German boat as a memento.

Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort, and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi-
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the

John Madden, Victoria’s Chief Justice,
completed his 71st year on May 16. Speaker
Frank Madden and Walter (sometime Min-
ister of Lands) are younger brothers. John
has been on the Bench for 22 years, having
succeeded the great George Iliginbotham
in January, 1893, a couple of months be-
fore Samuel Griffith was made Chief Justice
of Queensland. Madden is the second-oldest
Chief Justice in Australia. The senior of
all the Judges here, as well as in any British
oversea Dominion, is Chief Justice Way, of
South Aus., who is in his 80th year, and
has been on the Bench since March, 1876 —-
more than 39 years. Next in age to Way
and also next in seniority as regards length
of service on the Bench is Justice a’Beckett,
who will be 79 next August. He has been
on the Victorian Supreme Court Bench since
September. 1886, nearly 29 years. Chief
Justice John has two other colleagues who
are also long stayers—Hodges, appointed
a Judge in 1889; and Hood, who was raised
to the Bench in the following year.
SUCCESS.
RITA: “So you collected on Belgian Day.
Much luck?"
RUBY: “Oh, heaps! Made enough appoint-
incuts to last me three months."
N.S.W.’s retiring Agent-General went to
London as Coghlan. He was kniglited and
became Colan. On Wise’s arrival he will be
promoted to a Full Stop.
Judge John Gordon, of South Aus., usually
the most genial of men, broke out lately with
a hot denunciation of the legal profession in
that State, both at the Bar and studying at
the Uni., for not enlisting in greater numbers.
A Law Clerk promptly replied with eloquent
figures, and reminded his Honor that S.A.
had consistently supplied as many men as the
military authorities said they wanted. But
he didn’t stop there: carrying the war home
and adapting a Bulletin argument, he sug-
gested that the Judge might offer at least
half his yearly £I7OO to the national cause
before urging others to offer all they have —
their lives. The spirited effusion was un-
signed—naturally. If ever there is a time
when the veil of anonymity is excusable it is
when a law-clerk is exchanging back-talk
with a Judge.
From an old Australian in London: —
Passed out, Mrs. Bernard Beere, a powerful emo-
tional actress of the ’7o’s and ’Bo’s, who made a
tour of Australia. Born Whitehead, she had novel-
ist Thackeray for a godfather, and Charles White-
head, poet, playwright and journalist, for an uncle.
Charles Whitehead was a leading figure in London
literary circles, and an intimate friend of Charles
Dickens, Thackeray, Bulwer Lytton, etc. Losing
caste through a common weakness, he emigrated to
Melbourne, wrote for the Argus, relapsed, was picked
up unconscious in Lonsdale-street, died in the Mel-
bourne Hospital, and was buried in the pauper’s sec-
tion of the Melbourne Cemetery. It makes that
city's most gruesome literary tragedy. “A For-
gotten Genius,” by 11. T. MacKenzie Bell, is the story
of his life and work. Whitehead’s niece, the just-
departed Mrs. Bernard Beere, modelled her style on
Sarah Bernhardt’s. She had an unsuccessful spell of
management at London Globe, during which she pro-
duced Tennyson’s ‘‘Promise of May,” which had
one of the rowdiest first nights on record. Prime
Minister Gladstone, an intimate friend of the laureate-
author, occupied a stage-box, and even he was guyed
by the gallery ; but the crisis came when the Marquis
of Queensberry, a free-thinking peer, arose in the
stalls and vehemently protested against certain stric-
tures on agnosticism uttered by one of the characters.
Mahony, whose funeral procession might
almost have met Pewtress’s coming back,
had not the picturesque figure of the old
London policeman who stuck all through
life to his long side-whiskers. Forty years
ago Maliony was a great runner, the equal
of Hewitt. As he confessed years later it
was because they seemed “flash” that he
joined the Vic. mounted police. Chief Commis-
sioner Standish, an acute judge of men,
soon collared him and turned him into a
detective. At that there was a guffaw,
which was renewed when he was grabbed
by uniformed men for impersonating a ’tec.
But Standish knew his worth. At his new
job he proved thoroughly efficient, and along
with his mate Sainsbury he ran up the
ladder quickly. He was an inspector in
1894, and 10 years later was Melbourne
Superintendent, next to O’Callaghan, who
had been inspector at Bendigo when
Mahony was senior detective there and
Sainsbury junior. After O’Callaghan had
become Chief Commissioner Mahony re-
placed him when he was on leave, and
Sainsbury . followed him permanently—
another reunion of Bendigo men who had
climbed to the top.
F. T. 11. Bullen, who answered the roll
at Gisborne (M:L.) the other day, joined
the Victorian police in 1852, but left after
six years’ service and went prospecting
with two others, getting the Government
reward for discovering gold at Londonderry.
Drifting to Maoriland, he wms again in uni-
form, and arrested the first man to
b' 1 sentenced to death in Otago. This
was one White, wanted for murder.
Bullen learned that an effort was to
be made by the murderer’s friends
to do away with the body so that
an inquest could not be held. He therefore
put the deceased in a hole, covered him
with earth, and erected a tent over the
hiding place. Bullen was the last of Bran-
nigan’s famous force, recruited in Victoria,
to police the M.L. gold diggings.
“Quill” refuses to believe they will all be
interned: —•
That Baron Schroeder who has been making effusive
professions of loyalty in London belongs to a family
with a history. Born at Hamburg and married to a
German, he was transferred while still a young man
to the banking house of J. H. Schroeder & Cos., in
Leadenliall-street. His uncle, a Prussian baron and
English baronet, was senior partner. This relation,
only recently dead, had lived in England for many
years, and was the intimate personal friend of
Edward VII., particularly during the long days of
waiting for the Crown. Edward’s finances in that
period were at times a little involved. Schroeder
was the man who saw him through. The family had
the same intimate relations with other expectant
royalties and nobles, and the benevolent old Baron
was never obliged to stay at a pub when visiting
Austria, Russia or Spain. Ilis nephew has carried
on business with the same exalted clientele, and the
thought of him interned behind barbed-wire with
butchers and bakers would make European aris-
tocracy shudder with dismay. What a story could
be written from the private ledgers and letter-books
of this house of Schroeder 1 But it never will be
written.

Died in London, of fever, Captain Regin-
ald Manning Heron, a grandson of that Wil-
liam Montagu Manning who in the long ago
was a Supreme Court Judge in N.S.W. and
Chancellor of Sydney University. Born at
Gladesville (Sydney) and educated at
King’s School, Parramatta, young Heron
went to S’Africa when the trouble was on
there and saw the disturbance through as
officer of a British regiment. Then_ the
Colonial office claimed him for administra-
tive work in Nigeria, and for 13 years his
address w r as somewhere near the equator.
Under the pen-name of “Australie” his
mother, now dead, was well known in Syd-
ney 30 years ago as the writer of rather
graceful verse.
For dry, pawky Scotch wit the late Mal-
colm Tolmie, a Bendigo bank manager
known to old Bendigonians for 50 years,
was without a local equal. Head Office was
pressing him to call in the overdraft of an
Irish farmer whom Tolmie knew to be a
safe mark. After repeated orders, H.O.
wrote Tolmie to say if Mick O’Grady did
not pay up soon, a writ would be issued.
Tolmie wrote to Mick —“Dear sir, Pay up.
Yours truly.” Weeks passed by and H.O.
gave instructions for the writ to be issued.
Then the bank manager wrote to O’Grady:
“Dear sir. Look out. Yours truly.” Then
Mick came in and paid off his loan. The
branch manager knew O’Grady’s word was
better than his bond; but Head Office had
never met Mick.
Killed somewhere in Flanders, Anthony
Wilding, the world’s champion tennis player,
and perhaps the best match player of
any time. With Norman Brookes he re-
moved the Davis Cup from Wimbledon to
Australia, and last year assisted in winning
it from the United States. Born in Christ-
church (M.L.), the son of a lawyer who
is himself a remarkably fine player still,
young Wilding was educated at Christ’s
College, and subsequently at Cambridge,
whence he was called to the Bar. But even
as a lad the racket and net had been a
strong fascination, and in manhood he never
allowed the law to interfere much with his
sets and rubbers. Of abounding vitality,
brainy and lithe —he had a frame of wire
and whipcord—Wilding played the game
with a mastery which almost converted him
into a juggler. He was unmarried and only
82 when a French shell bursting over a
dngout carried him beyond the line. Those
who knew him won’t doubt that he was
came to the last.
Died at Bream Creek (Tas.) the other day
Thomas Riley, aged 95 years and some odd
months, reputedly the oldest native of the
Island. He was born at Forcett, and lived
there or thereabouts to the end. His father
■was born at Norfolk Island away back in the
beginning of things, and, coming to Tas-
mania, served in Governor Arthur’s “Black
Line” in 1880. People live long in those
parts. The neighboring village of Richmond
claims a centenarian, Mrs. Crawley, and only
a couple of years since John Daniels was
snatched away in the pride of his manhood;
and, rightly or wrongly, they put 104 on his
tombstone.
THE MESALLIANCE.
The harem of his Islamic Majesty, Wilhelm H., the
principal officers of the harem, and the general staff
are expected in Constantinople early this spring.
—Turkish society news.
A youth who was called upon to answer a
charge of drill-dodging in Sydney, last week
failed to answer to his name. He couldn’t
very well. His mother told the Court that
the boy, having been refused by the military
authorities in N. S. Wales “because his chest
was too narrow,” had gone to Europe on his
own account, in order to get to the Front.
Private Enterprise scored one that time, any-
how.
THE TROJAN WAR, 1915.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We cave not what old Ifomer tells
Of Trojan war and Helen’s fame:
Upon the ancient Dardanelles
Australia writes—in blood—-her name.
Those Grecian heroes long have fled;
No more the Plain of Troy they haunt:
Made sacred by Australian dead,
Historic is the Hellespont.
Homeric wars are fought again
By men who like the Greeks can die;
Australian backblock heroes slain
With Hector and Achilles lie.
No legend lured these men to roam;
Australians fight to keep from harm
Some mother-Helen sad at home,
Some obscure Helen on a farm.
And when one falls upon the hill,
Upon dark Styx’s gloomy strand
In honor to plain Private Bill,
Great Agamemnon lifts his hand!

The present paid capital is £90,000, and
lie less than £52,500 of it has been added out
of reserves since 1900. So a 16 p.c. div.,
which called for about £BOOO in 1904, re-
quires £14,400 in 1915. The transfer of
reserves to capital tvas unduly rushed, with
the result that, in order to maintain the
rate of dividend and other payments, it has
actually been necessary during the last
couple of years to distribute more than the
total profit; and, with its risks increasing,
it doesn’t look good to see an insurance
office’s reserves stationary or receding. Most
of the trouble is due to the basis on which
the profits are distributed: The Australian
Mutual was a rather old-fashioned concern
which, desiring at the outset to stress its
co-operative character, called itself a society
and not a company, fixed its "interest” at
S p.c., and for the rest of its profits decided
that it should only come in and share equally
with the policy-holders.. Of late years most
offices have been allowing 10 p.c. off on
renewals; hence this Society, since the
shareholders expect to get the same bonus
as the policy-holders, must distribute 20 p.c.
by way of bonus. It is the 10 p.c. qf the
premiums plus 8 p.c. on the capital which
together amount to the £14,t24 ( = 16 p.c.
on the capital) shown above. Unquestion-
ably £90,000 is a modest enough capital for
a co. with the Australian Mutual’s re-
sources and doing a business of this size.
The trouble is that TO p.c, is much too great
a bonus to pay on the premiums. It may
have been all right when the co. stuck
almost wholly to gilt-edged risks, brought in
chiefly by friends. But nowadays the co. is
out in the hurly-burly, and instead oi: an
underwriting profit of 30 or 40 p.c. the eo.
is very lucky to get much more than 15 p.c.
It has averaged a good deal less than that
the past couple of years. Certainly the
past year was a bad one on account of ex-
cessive claims, due to the greater moral
hazard —in plain English, to the fact that
fires are more apt to occur when times are
bad than when they are good—but it is
coming to be a question whether even in
normal times the basis of distributing profits
hasn’t outlived its day. The strain on the
co. is too great.

The co.’s position is extraordinarily strong.
Its invested funds, apart from till money
and trading balances, etc., amounted on
March 31 to £236.505 —that is to say, more
than nine times the greatest amount which
the co. ever had to pay cut in losses in one
year. In the current year, assuming a cash
revenue and expenses equal to last year’s, the
co. could pay losses amounting to £llO,OOO,
or more than it has had to pay out in the
past seven years put together, without
realising on a single one of its non-liquid
securities ; and its non-liquid securities (city
freeholds and mortgages) run to another
£159.000. The co. is so strong that it could,
on its present resources, double its risks
without turning a hair.

When war occurred and it was clear that the
wool sales would be knocked out, most sell-
ing brokers advised their clients that ther# r
was quite insufficient storage accommodation
in Sydney for all the N. S. Wales clip, and
they had better keep what they could at the
shearing sheds and the scours. It was
urged that, by following this course, the
insurance bill would be reduced and the
owners wouldn’t be indefinitely standing out
of the freight, etc. This Co-operative Co.
did not agree with that: it advised owners
to send their stuff along to await a market,
and it hustled around lo secure extra stor-
age. Apparently the co. is quite satisfied
with its attitude: "making allowance,” it
says, "for extra shipments to London by
clients as a result of the war. the co. shows
a net gain in business for the year of about
10,000 bales.” But naturally the policy hasn’t
put money into the co.’s pocket straight off.
The co. makes no receiving charge ; there-
fore it has been put to considerable expense,
from which it has so far got no return, in
respect of the wool still in store on March.
31. This hold-over was 12,500 bales more
than for the preceding year.
The dividend phis the bonus or return-
commission to clients absorbs considerably
more than the year’s profit; but the deijcit
is made good by. a draft on the clients’ bonus
reserve, which had been created specially to
meet a case of this sort;, and is very justi-
fiably drawn upon now to the extent of
£2OOO. This allows of a refund of 20. p.c.
of the selling commission to clients; and as,
that commission is 2-§ p.c., the rebate reduces
the inclusive charge to 2 p.c. net. These
are better terms than the Victorian growers
can command; and the Co-opyalive Co.
claims that it is the lone hand' ii plays in
the Sydney field which gives the X. S. Wales
grower the advantage. There is. some-
thing in the claim if one may judge by the
aloofness which exists betwen the Co-opera-
tive Co., and the other selling brokers. By
reason of .the unusual quantity of avool stored
the co: is much further in debt than usual.
As a rule it can finance all its consignments-
on hand in March with bank etc,,
of from £lO.OOO to £20.000. This year the.
liabilities total £06,5(58. But the great
improvement in the wool market since most
of the produce was stored ought to have put
the co. in a comfortable position in relation
to its advances.

That shows a net profit of £10,029 for the
year, of which ’£8414 is now distributed;
and this paper is not disposed to shy that
the distribution is not justified, for this
isn’t the time to either pass or cut down
dividends if the money has been earned and
the business isn’t in urgent need of it. In
fact, there are cases in which a payment is
justified even if it hasn’t been earneu in the
term. The Bulletin is not much enam-
ored of dividend equalisation reserves; but
where directors insist on having them, this
surely is the time to use them. If they are
not used now, then they are a delusion and
a snare and had far better be abolished
altogether. However, this doesn’t apply to
Nicholson’s, which doesn’t claim to have a
dividend equalisation reserve. It is in the
position ; of having made, according to the
accounts, £10,029 in the year; and as its
liabilities are now strictly moderate, there
was no good, reason why a fail dividend
should not fee paid.
Noteworthy changes have been made in
the business during the 12 months,:- —

The liabilities were heavy, and the Stock
Exchange plainly didn’t like them. But
the overdraft, which was £46,277 12 months
ago, has been worked down to £4942, and
a few thousands have also been lopped off
other debts. Maybe, the management
couldn’t very well help itself. Its supplies
of instruments from Europe were cut off :
and, though another buying market has been
opened up in the U.S.A. it has probably
been easier to reduce stocks than increase
them, and reduction of stocks has meant
reduction also of overdraft. Further, it
has no doubt been easier to get instalments
in on old time-payment sales than to make
new ones. But a co. can’t go on
indefinitely like this and flourish. It
is all very well to give three cheers for the
reduction of debt; but there isn’t much in it
if it is due to the gradual winding up of
old time-payment bargains while compara-
tively few new ones are being made.
Nicholson and Co. have one advantage.
-Not one penny of the'capital of £140,2317 is
represented hv goodwill or other paper
assets. Nor is any of either the capital or
the reserves sunk in business premises. Of
the total assets —£212.429—n0 less than
£155,145 is represented by hire agreements
and £44,732 by stock. Apparently the
profits on the sales or hires have been
credited when the agreements have been
-signed. It looks so, at any rate. If it
hadn’t been so —if, in other words, any of
the profit had been reserved—it would surelv
have been mentioned. All that is mentioned
is “unearned interest and insurance.” Be-
sides the £155,145 above-mentioned as com-
ing to the co. in payment for pianos sold «>u
t.p., there is £20,083 which the auditors
have computed to lie the part fairly charge-
able against interest and insurance. Even,
then, though the co. has eaten its cake of
profit, it will still for a while get some brend-
aml-butler out of interest. Presently, if things
go as they have been going lately, the co.
will have cash to let out on short call; and
that and the small pickings that will come
from current Inisi ness—for there will be
some business even if things are dead or
thereabouts in the t.p. piano trade—ought
to put a crust or two in the cupboard until
the savage of Potsdam is muzzled and good
seasons bring back prosperity.

The directors don’t put it that way.'
They show a whole lot,of reserves; and their
figures and those in the last line may be
brought into harmony like this: —
Renewal and contingencies reserve ..£11,901
Franchise sinking fund .. ... .. 8,500
Accident insurance reserve L, .. 2,000
Dividend equalisation reserve. 7. .. 3,000
Reserve fund .. .. 6,000

Total reserves .. .. . . £32,717
Less purchase account .. .. . . 35,257
Deficit as above. . .. . . £2,540
The Purchase account and the Franchise/?
sinking fund are explained this' way. The
nucleus of flic business belonged to the Bris-
bane. Electric'Supply Co. This present co.
paid £35,257 for the goodwill, which is
based - on an Drder-in-Gouncil or similar con-
cession,’ giving the eo. the right to. supply
the city with electric light till 1946. The
local "authority may then buy the co. out,
paying only a fair price for the material
that is of use—that is to say, the council
can take:, over serviceable lines and 'stock at
valuation, but hasn’t to buy the goodwill. If
the co. escapes then, it has another 10 years’
run; if it escapes then, another 10 years,
and so on. As the franchise thus expires
in 1940, or, at any rate, is liable to expire,
a sinking fund ha* been established to
restore the capital represented by the pur-
chase price. Hence the entries above-
mentioned.
Though the co. seems to be pretty securely
tied on to Brisbane’s back, it has evidently
been thought imprudent to throw t6o big a
dividend into the face of the public. Fifteen
p.c. is bad enough ; but if it hadn’t been for
40,000 shares issued as a bonus 12 months
ago and paid to 10s., it would look still
worse. As a matter of fact, though 15 p.c.
is paid on the watered ordinary stock, there
is an amount left over to lay by equal to
half of the total dividend, without including
the sinking fund contribution as lay by.
The co. is on a good, wicket all right.
Nothing is much surer, though, than that,
when it can score like this at the expense
of the general consumer, sooner or later an
attempt will be made to bowl it out. And
as the gas shareholders o£*N. S. Wales dis-
covered, even the dear old gentlemen of the
Leg. Council, who would rather any day
kill a caterpillar than a capitalist, simply
had to do something with regard to the
regulation of profits from lighting when it
was put to them that that had been the
policy of the English Parliament for years
past.

That odd dividend for the year makes the
distribution average 10 p.c. for the trien-
nium—which isn’t quite as good as for the
previous similar period, but is a heap better
than for any three years before that. Still,
it is only 10 p.c. in a manner of speaking:
for these shares, now 305., were once £5
paid. The balance was written off on a re-
valuation 14 years ago of the Glebe and
Waterloo leasehold estates. In the past
10 years there have been these movements:

Nowadays the co.. while nursing the rem-
nant of its old properties, and selling them
when it can, is out hunting for new mort-
gages: but it hasn’t the means to go hunting
tar. Some day. when the sky is clearer, it
may ask for more deposits to play with. But
it is doubtful' it there is ever going to be
very much money in that business again: the
State will probably go further and further
into the job of lending people money to make
their own homes, and State competition in
such a matter renders things pretty hopeless
lor the private moneylender. An heroic
Private Enterpriser may say that he can
compete with the State because he can elim-
inate “the Goyernment stroke.” .But the
Government stroke doesn’t enter into this
business of merely lending out money—any-
way, not to any extent worth mentioning.
So as a mere lender on suburban cottages
this co. probably lias not much of a future ;
while as the landlord of a couple of lease-
hold estates, it must either secure new
business or steadily prepare for its last day.

“Instructions have been given to invite ten-
ders for the construction of a suitable
steamer for the Newcastle-Sydney trade”;
and the service can certainly do with it.
In addition to this proposed new steamer
there is a drogher building in Sydney for
the river trade ; this will take the , place of
one that was lately burned.. At present the
co. has a lot of money lying around doing
things that a shipping co. isn’t formed to
do; no less than £78,000 is resting in the
bank. No doubt this money (most of
which seems to bo undisclosed profit
written off ostensibly against depreciation)
is beautifully safe there; but it is not doing
much for shareholders. This is how the
position compares with that of previous
years:—•

There are big things ahead of Newcastle;
and while paying reasonable divs. the co.
has worked itself into a line position to
take advantage of opportunities offering for
new business. Mavbe the disclosed profits
are something like the true profits ; but the
remarkably rapid growth of the liquid
assets, as shown in the last table, coupled
with the remarkably rapid decrease in the
book value of the steamers, suggests that
an extraordinarily liberal amount of profit
has been written off against wear and tear
these last five years.

What the co. wants with a whole £7OB of
reserves this paper doesn’t know. Usually
when the P. and B. balance amounts to
more than about £lOO the directors write
something down and thus get rid of the
superfluous wealth, so far as the books go.
It therefore really isn’t much use taking
note of any one term’s figures. Not that
The Bulletin suspects that the co. is
stuffing much away. A co. can’t, in fact,
stuff profits away indefinitely; the stocking
will burst or overflow some time or other.
Sometimes —as in the case of the Bank of
Australasia, for instance —the profit be-
comes so great that the invisible profit-earn-
ing reserves disclose themselves that way.
At other times (as with the Howard Smith
Co.) the stocking is relieved by disclosing
hidden profits and issuing bonus shares to
absorb them. But in this case of the Illa-
warra Co. there is really nothing to suggest
that tlie stocking is being unduly strained.
Ten years ago the six months’ net profit
was £3562; to-day’s is less, though South
Coast conditions were better in; the past
half-year than in the corresponding six
months of 1904-5. Meantime there has
been no issue of bonus shares, and no accu-
mulation of cash. On the contrary, in 11 >os*
the co. had over £45.000 net of liquid assets,
mostly Treasury hills and fixed deposits :
to-day, apart from a few thousands in book
debts, the liquid assets are less than the
liabilities. Thus in 10 years £45.000 (=.
three-fifths of the capital) has been changed
from the most gilt-edged securities into ship
property, and the average net profit doesn’t
seem to he any better, though the risks are
much greater. It isn’t a 10 years’ record to
be very jubilant over. For this lack of
progress the blame isn’t all to lie with the
co. Most of the fault belongs to the bovine
but rich district which the co. serves; and
as there are uo signs of any serious awaken-
ing there, he would be a very hopeful man
who on this co.’s 10 years’ history would
look for any sudden rise in dividends or
share values.

Somebody ought to take the Sydney wool-
selling anti the buying brokers and bump
their silly heads together. The public m
getting very tired of them and their in-
numerable quarrels —how very tired they
perhaps won’t realise till some cold morn-
ing they read that the Government, which
now does all the wool-carting, has decided
to also take over the wool-selling. The
present stupid little row mainly concerns,
a few weeks’ interest. The buyers say they
may not be able to get bottoms at once,
owing to their regular ships being comman-
deered, and they want to be. allowed to. let
the wool lie in the stores for six weeks with-
out paying interest. Brisbane selling
brokers, after consulting the growers,
agreed. The Sydney associated firms re-
fused, apparently not so much because the
request was unreasonable as because, as
one puts it, “if you give these buyers an inch
they’ll want an ell.” This dread of the
other party’s wickedness is at the back of
most of the squabbling; and it isn’t a good
enough reason to satisfy a public which, as
remarked .just now, is getting so tired that
the brokers, if they know when they are well
off, will speedily come to terms.
F. 11. Snow, who formerly represented
the Ilirsches and other big Continental
metal firms in Australia-—some German and
some French —-has been acquitted on the
long-drawn-out charge of trading with the
enemy. Judge Gordon refused even to allow
the matter to go to the jury. ' There is very
little doubt that Snow tried to hold the
trade for his business friends and hoped to
resume relations when the war is over. And
b TT the present look of things Australia will
either have to resume those relations and
sell its zinc concentrates to the Germans
or not sell them at all, for '.though nine
months have passed since the, war started,
and though spelter has trebled in price dur-
ing that time, no serious effort has been
made to establish the zinc-smelting business
anywhere else. Judge Gordon's view was
that Snow didn’t make any attempt to trade
after October, when the Act : was passed,
and that there was no law previously in
existence to declare that anything he had
done, in August and September was a
criminal act. The lawyers have had a
great innings. And some other people have
gained too —people who wanted a look in-
side Snow’s office. It is to be hoped the
information that has come out will only be
used to advance Australian and British
trade. It is to be feared, though, that Ger-
man agents, wearing British , cloaks, , have
carefully filed it away for future use.
The High Court did a very sensible thing
I lie other day and agreed with The Bvj.i.k-
ri v. The question was “whether the sum of
£63,000 (subject to permitted deductions) was
income derived from a source in the State [of
X. S. Wales], as contended by appellants, or
from a source outside the State, as contended
by respondents.” The Sulphide Corporation
(head office, London) made• a contract to
sell 120,000 tons of Broken lli'll slimes to the
Hydraulic Power and Smelting Co. The
co. paid £63,000, all of it outside the State;
then it failed to make payments, and agreed
to forfeit the money and cancel the contract.
Xo slimes were delivered. The N.S.W. Full
Court evidently thought the profit was made
out of the brains of the Sulphide Corpora-
tion’s English directors, or the want of
brains in the other co.’s directors, and de-
cided that the “profit” wasn’t taxable in
X T . S. Wales. But Chief Justice Griffith
summed it all up when he said: “Damages
received as compensation for non-perform-
ance of a business contract stood on the
same footing as the profits for the loss of
which the damages were paid. It could not
therefore make any difference in principle
whether the money was actually earned as
profit or paid as compensation for loss of the
opportunitv for earning that profit.” Judg-
ment for the Taxation people—with costs,
as usual.
The Zinc Corporation comes into the
Broken Hill smelting scheme, taking 100,000
of the reserved 150,000 shares. That makes
the partners—B. 11. Prop., B. H. South and
B. H. North, 200,000 each; Zinc Corp.,
100,000. The last-named concern was formed
originally to handle only zinc tailings, but
it subsequently bought the South Blocks,
which is a fair producer; and, besides, a
certain quantity of silver-lead is won from
the zinc tailings on a preliminary re-treat-
ment. Of course the issue of 6 p.c. deben-
tures at 97 by the B. 11. South and North
was a great success. They asked for
£400.000 between them, and were offered over
£2,000,000. It was too good an investment
to require the 2 p.c. underwriting commis-
sion which the Baillieus and their friends
got.

Vegetable Creek (N.S.W.) is to be put
through a course of development, the main
object being to connect the shafts and
workings by leading drives, so that blocking
out may be facilitated. Sinking the Strath-
bogie shaft Ims been discontinued, but some
boring will be done when the drilling plant
arrives in July. From August to the end
of January no tin was produced, but from
February to the end of April the output
was between 60 and 70 tons. All of it has
been sold. The directors say they “have
been able to create a fair bank balance” and
reduce the debt to the vendors. In August
there was a cash balance of about £5OOO,
so that after even paying for development
work the position should be all right.
More capital has been raised to give the
Hidden Secret at Ivalgoorlie another trial.
Originally this show formed part of the big
area monopolised by the Hannans Prop.;
but when that co. became stranded the mine
was abandoned, along with a lot of others.
Later on a party of Italians came along and
unexpectedly struck a rich telluride shoot
containing a few ounces of gold and a heap
of silver per ton. About £70.000 worth of
bullion was extracted, and then the shoot
cut out. The telluride was first discovered
by following a small indicator, and this
indicator, it is claimed, has again been
picked up lower down.

A Melbourne option syndicate headed by
Alec Peacock has taken on the old British
Flag at Laverton (W.A.), and, if the option
is exercised, will give the vendors £4500 cash
in addition to the £5OO deposit for five-
sixths of the mine. The show was one of
the first pegged in the district, and got a bit
of an advt. soon after by yielding 2000 oz. of
gold from a patch struck near the surface.
Then values vanished and the prospectors fol-
lowed suit. Recently the ground was taken
up by Westhead and party, and in the last
few weeks over 500 oz. have been obtained by
them on the contact of a cross-lode with a
porphyry dyke, and a lot of rich ore, besides
30 or 40 tons of 4oz. to soz. stuff dumped on
surface, is claimed to be in sight. But the
locality is a patchy one, and reckoned best
suited for working parties.
Y. F. Shall cross has formed a prospecting
syndicate of Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth
speculators. The first venture to be tackled
is the Morning Star, at Magnet (W.A.L
which in the past has produced one-third of
a million sterling, but has earned very little
for shareholders. The ore in sight is said
to be in a very wide channel, and the syndi-
cate proposes to make a search for parallel
shoots.

Yuanmi Co. (W.A.) has now 23 (includ-
ing 10 optioned 1 leases at Warriedar. on
the Yalgoo field. Good prospects have been
obtained in places, but: a permanent and
adequate supply of water is making the co.
think. Five leases are also held under op-
tion. and nine more have been applied for at
Rothsay, on the same field. London caoital.
badly handled, dropped its bundle at Roth-
say some years ago, and since then the place
has had a bad name. The Yuanmi is now
making an effort to rehabilitate it in the
eyes of the speculative public.
“Mining Engineer”; A few candid words
about Weston’s (W.A.) from within. The
most important feature of the past month
or two has been the demonstration of the
fact that the width and length of the main
shoot at the No. 3 level compare favorably
with the dimensions up above. This was
unexpected, as it was- generally thought
that the underlie of the greenstone or foot-
wall country would continue uniform with
depth. Had that occurred each succeeding
level would have shortened, the prospects
of the Edna May and Edna Deeps would
have been seriously menaced, and those of
the Edna May Central brightened. Now
indications point to each succeeding level
being longer than the one immediately
above, and the shoot may remain in Edna
ground until it either snuffs out or passes
into the Deeps, Unfortunately the results
obtained by the Central have not justified
the hopes predicted for it by those in con-
trol, and developments do not hold out
much prospect of improved returns in the
future. The Central contains a quantity
of fair ore of good width near the Edna
boundary, but neither width nor value is
maintained as work is continued east from
that point. Some new development may
improve the px-esent outlook; but that is
only speculation. The yarn about the like-
lihood of that poi-tion of the Edna reef in
Central ground getting richer with depth
has nothing to back it up. As for the
blocks in the vicinity of the Edna May and
Boodalin Soak that have been floated in
Adelaide and Melbourne, there is no doubt
that the public has been in most cases
garrotted. In several instances both the
original and go-between vendors received
cash considerations out of all proportion
to the value of what they offered. The
public is going to suffer, and in some cases
rather badly.

Northern Hope Central, the newest Bal-
larat float, repi'esents a bit off the Northern
Hope lease and a slab off the Beaufort Deep
Leads at Beaufort. Because the first-
named co. is on the div. list and dan hand
over a three-compartment shaft, it sops up
8500 shares paid to 2s. (id. out of a register
of 34,000 10s. shares, besides getting- the
call of 8500 shares for 10 days. Beaufort
Deep Leads’ plunder is £750 cash and an
option to buy 10,000 shares, presumably at
2s. 6d. each. As 4000 shares go to reserve,
apart from 3000 to promoter Fred Ilolst,
there won’t be any room for the outsider
if shareholders of the two existing cos. re-
spond to the prospectus plan. As Fred
Holst is always willing to help a pal, he may
unloose a few of his semi-paids—for a con-
sideration. Minister Brown has to sanction
the dismemberment of the two cos.’ leases.
As he wants to see men at work, he isn’t
likely to object. The co. can be viewed as
on a fair keel, thanks, among other things,
to the Ilolst underwriting agreement.
Some of the big guns of Melbourne Stock
Exchange profess to be startled at Moline’s
last clean-up at Cock’s Pioneer, Eldorado.
Truly 120,000 cubic yards for 3d. per yard
is a wretched showing for a co. with a capital
of £lOO,OOO. But everything depends on
whence the wash came. Three runs of gold
exist in the gutter—No. 1 at 30ft., No. 2
at 50ft. and No. 3at 75ft. The best values
are at the bottom. If, as is almost certain,
Moline got a non-appreciable quantity of
the bottom dirt into the sump, there is
nothing significant in this latest experience.
The old Jack Dane Co., higher up-stream,
averaged about Is. 4d. per cub. yard from
gold and tin, the latter representing, say,
a quarter of the value of the yield, and
slapped up £120,000 of metals before it
■sold out. The present co.’s sampling went
about the same from the barge site up
stream to the old face, as well as in the
two-acre paddock sluiced. Cock’s new plant
shaves costs to Bd. Should the three bot-
toms in the gutter yield up to sampling,
there must be a natty surplus to provide
profits and cash for handling the big block
lower down stream, into which bores . will
soon be prodded. Next month Moline
should be well into the bottom dirt; after
that ,if lie gets a threepenny yield it; will
be time to call Cock’s Pioneer another Lode
Hill failure.
Some Adelaide speculators are getting, on
to the granite tin-bearing outcrops at Mitta
Mitta (Vic.). One Wm. McGregor, who
confesses to a 30 years’, tussle with mine
problems, furnishes a nice-reading report,
on the lines of a track blazed previously by
the State geologists. He counts up 10
parallel dykes varying in width from 10ft. to
100 ft. The co. thus will have as big faces
to draw on as the Anchor at the Blue Tier
(Tas.), If assay values given , are not
too staggeringly good. Mitta Mitta will
have the shaking-up of its life. It is told
tl.at costeens and shafts sunk along the
dykes have all given material averaging
31 p.c. oxide. Lewis’s work at the Anchor
was done for well below ss. per ton, and
was a world’s record ; but the. Mitta is to
beat him with 35., the oxide being saved by
dry crushing and concentration. Think of
3 p.c. oxide “and lodes on the mine to carry
you along crushing a thousand tons per
diem for a century”! Why, with that to
splash on, trouble to add that “with care-
ful and efficient management this mine can
be made a huge and profitable business in-
vestment”? All this raises the question why
j. B. Lewis missed this bonanza at Mitta
Mitta, leaving himself to the hard job of
wrestling to keep the poor old Anchor out
of debt.
* * • * *
The Lansell crowd, running the Williams’
United, Bendigo, on big formations at 2000 ft.
and 2100 ft., ambiguously promises to dis-
burse dividends “more occasionally in the
future.” Seeing that the co. crushed 1319
loads and averaged 6dwt. last half-year,
there ought to be more than an infrequent
sprat for shareholders. While the wait is
on, the usual little flutter is noticeable at
the Beehive. As the price is only about
2s. ‘6d., it is clear the insiders don’t bank
much on either the mine prospects or the
directors’ expectations.

Railton-Latrobe Shale Go. (Tas.) has
been favorably reported upon by Dr. Wade,
who has, by the way, gone back to Papua
for the Commonwealth Government. He
estimates there are 51 million tons of tas-
manite or oil shale available for retorting
on the co.’s areas, containing 40 gallons of
crude petroleum per ton, or altogether 220
million gallons. He says there is 50 years’
work in sight, and strongly urges the Com-
monwealth Government to buy the Railton-
Latrobe Co.’s leases and w'orks. The crude
oil is nearly free of sulphur and makes an
ideal fuel for steamers. With slight chemi-
cal treatment it makes first-class spraying
oil for orchard purposes. As the treatment
works are in the heart of a big and growing
orchard district, the demand for this spray-
ing oil will be very large. The Railton-
Latrobe Co. is in 40.000 £1 shares —20,000
fully paid and 20.000 paid to 6s. The stock
is not listed, but late sales were made at
12s. 6d. for eontribs. and £1 for paids.

Australia’s deepest tin mine, the Vulcan
(N.Q.). has “come” again. In five weeks
it has crushed 1092 tons for 55 tons con-
centrates. worth f 4079. It is winning its
best ore at the 550 ft. level, where the face
has developed to 32ft. wide, all payable.
There will be no shortage of ore for many
months to come, for payable stuff is also
being broken at the next tw r o levels under-
neath.
The Sydney-Meibourne concern —the Timor
Petroleum . Concessions, Ltd. —which was
formed three years ago to get rich quick in the
Portuguese island, hasn’t yet bought any
motor-cars with the proceeds.' * Joe Car-
ruthers reports on behalf of the directors that
so far as they know they are down only
about 300 ft., and have not struck much yet
except trouble —and, of course, the usual
‘‘indications.” One of the Melbourne direc-
tors is now in the island, so shareholders
may learn something more definite presently.
Meantime, as there was only £164 in the
bank on March 31, the uncalled capital is to
be got in and the few unissued shares sent
to market. , On March 31 the paid capital
was £19,150; the authorised capital is
£2-2,500.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, May 17, 1915.
My Dear Arini, —
Belgian Day began at daybreak, and con-
tinued till rain had soaked the draggled
remnant of the crowd. The street collec-
tors were as the sands of the sea, and they
sold alleged immunity from further appeals
for one shilling upwards. However, the
“Stand off!” sign didn’t help much ; the sight
of 10s. worth of golden heart dangling from
the buttonhole of a plain citizen merely in-
cited some of the skirted highwaymen to
fresh efforts. Anyone generous enough to
pay half a sovereign for immunity from
attack could surely afford another ten for a
second inoculation.
The procession moved at a snail’s pace
through a shower of cash. Celia Ghiloni, a
large and smiling Britannia, turned a glit-
tering array of teeth on the crowd, which
yelled its joy at the Empire group. Julius
Knight, as Napoleon, rode a steady grey
crock, which patiently flicked its white eye-
lashes at the crash of drums ahead. Cyril
Mackay, a dapper figure as King Albert, had
the “meat” of the show. Loud noises
acclaimed him as the hero of the hour.
The hardest place to get to at one o’clock
was the Town Hall. Cheers for the
monarch of the battered. little king-
dom were diluted with ■ the hoarse in-
dignation of those persons who hadn’t
sufficient space- to breathe, . let alone
cheer. A surging crowd was rent with ' re-
pressed fury at the corner of Park and
Geoi'ge streets. Some of it wanted to get
home —wherever home might be —and the
rest of it wanted to see what was to happen
when the one-o’clock gun went off. On top
of the stone portico in front of the muni-
cipal hall, Governor Strickland, with Aide
Pasco in naval rig, Premier Holman, Con-
sul Watteeuw, Hugh Ward (organiser of the
Belgian corroboree) and a circle of officials,
was seen to say something. Then cheers —-
followed by a melee in which two crowds
going in onposite directions fell upon each
other with some slaughter of tempers.
Her Majesty’s matinee was crammed with
£3500 worth —a record for an afternoon’s
booking here. The Stricklands were wedged
into the front stalls. Geoi'ge Marlow’s
party had a stage box at a fat price. Over
them John Hunter, who had paid about
£l5O for his bit of floor space, was caged
in the top box. Solicitor Arthur Allen, one
of the most persistent bidders at the auc-
tion, helped to keep Lincoln Plumcr’s clients
on the run. Edward Resell, of the brewery,
.scattered his coin. Two sports named
Walker and Forsyth challenged each other’s
bids with a fierce, determination to secure
the goods.
The star dramatic turn was “Bardell v.
Pickwick.” Jack McArdle as Sergeant Buz-
-I‘uz had an inimitable Mrs. Gluppins in
Maggie Moore, and Barry Lupino was a
Sam Weller who won I d have pleased even
Dickens himself —and he wasn’t the most
placable person in the world. The new
J.C.W. singer, Ethel Cadman, a recent im-
portation, was responsible for a mediocre
warble that didn't show her to a seat in
the front row.
Melba, in a grey fur coat and the newest
millinery, made a rather belated entry in
Her Majesty’s d.c. at the Belgian Day
matinee. As the latest hats, are rather
larger than a pill-box, tlie Voice was prac-
tically unrecognised except by a few
acquaintances who were near enough to
get the right focus. We are accustomed to
see the songstress smile and bow to loud
applause under the wide brim of yester-
year. If she will put a white thimble on
her stately head, and creep into her seat
when the lights are low, she can’t expect
the gallery to make its usual fuss.
The Melba concert for Poland on June 3
will be sprinkled with diamond tiaras. Lady
Helen M. Ferguson is to add her jewels to
the scene. The Strickland lady will be in
full war paint, and Lady Elison Macartney
and Tasmania’s argumentative Governor
will he on tlie carpet as w T ell. The Macart-
neys are to stay with our sub-royalty from
June 1 to 5. No official salutes, parades or
other exclusive gauds that pertain to a
King’s birthday will occur this year—by
the wish of George Rex. The Town Hall
concert for the relief of the ruins of Poland
will be the one star of the usually glittering-
holiday.
The Macgregor, formerly an Excellency
iu Queensland, is now following the peace-
ful occupation of Scottish laird. He is
the recent purchaser of an estate iu
Berwickshire.
The Soldiers’ Club, which provides soft
drinks and home comforts for our boys when
they’re on leave in town, should bank about
£lOO as a result of the Art Students’ tab-
leaux. Dr. Mary Booth, having blue-pen-
cilled her departure to infuriated Europe—-
for the present, anyhow—is hon. secretary of
the military rest-house; and F. G. Sargood,
of York-street, will gratefully accept your
largest contributions.
“The Awakening of Australia” tableau
was a perfected repetition of its April suc-
cess. For one thing, the boots of the ama-
teur scene-shifters had apparently been ex-
changed for carpet-slippers. The living
statuary, arranged by Dattilo Rubbo, was a
clear-cut series of six poses of famous sculp-
ture. At the finish the proceedings were
enlivened by one extra-polite statue —its name
was Dunbar —bowing thanks for the ap-
plause. As tlie statue was clad in ground rice,
to represent stone, the genuflection rather
upset the dignity of the orchestra. Mowat
Carter, in charge of an excellent collection
of fiddlers, had had his owm troubles earlier
in the evening. Having inadvertently left
his swallow-tails in the train he had to hunt
for an outfit among those fairly near his own
size. At the last moment he fell into Gil-
bert Howell’s evening duds, and all was
peace.
In the audience was State-Commandant
Wallack, who descended from his eyrie in the
d.c. and made a few remarks behind the foot-
lights. Miss Caro sold four Canadian maple-
leaf programmes at a guinea each. The vic-
tims were Geoffrey Fairfax, Miss Eadith
Walker, Miss Lottie Gilbert and Frank Dow-
ling. General Finn, in war finery, with his
elegant missus and the two Titian-haired
daughters, was perched near Mrs. Lang
Campbell and Mrs. Cox. Ernest Brpughton.
and his best girl, and the learned Louisa
Macdonald, M.A., of the Women’s. College,
were‘in the same d.c. area.' The Women’s.
"College chieftainess, by the way,.didn’t take
the living-statuary items with frantic enthu-
siasm, in spite of her hankering for Greek
art. But I suppose there is a difference
between marble and scrambled rice.
The Royal Geographical Society has
handed Douglas Mawson the Founder’s Medal
and two other ornaments for his Antarctic
work. But I believe he is prouder of the
baby-girl he found waiting for him in Mel-
bourne.
The State school-marm is easing her best
shoes so that she may keep up with the
kiddies’ dash to raise £lO.OOO for the Belgian
babes. The effort is to be made on Empire
Day.
Bernhard Wise left last week for the Lon-
don Agent-General’s office, travelling by way
of the U.S.A. Before he went the Govern-
ment asked itself and a few of Wise’s ner-
sonal friends to meet him at lunch at Par-
liament House. Most of the visiting inter-
state politicians were included in the
party—which would have felt more cheerful
if a more robust frier?d had been leaving
them to face five London winters. The
orce-dapner Wise has aged dreadfully these
last seven years.
Poor Quilter, who must have been a mark
like a lighthouse to the Unspeakable Turk,
has fallen at the Dardanelles. As military
secretary to Lord Denman he was one of
the most popular Helps any Governor-
General ever imported. A Guardsman and
a giant, he was still a mixture of joyous
schoolboy and industrious art critic He
hunted the dingy premises of old curio
and picture shops, and knew his subject
from Vi to A. When Melba was staying
with the Denmans she joined him in an
occasional ascent to artists’ studios, where
the Guardsman served as an index to the
best stuff on view. The Queen’s Club will
remember with tears that it had a fierce
grievance against him for having purloined
the only Jeames that ladies’ menagerie had
then acquired. The truth of the matter
was that the Calves in question preferred
the service of the purloiner, having previ-
ously “attended” the Quilter family in
England.
Mrs. Charlie Learoyd, wife of a wrell-
known Sydney woolbuyer, lost her husband
in the Lusitania atrocity. At least, he was
reported missing, and up to date no satis-
factory news has come along. About two
years ago, when the Learoyds were on their
way to England, their only son, a very
bright Small Boy, died after an appendicitis
operation. Mrs. Learoyd was amongst those
saved from the recent tragedy.
Amongst those ladies who lately chape-
roned their husbands to the Premiers’ con-
fab, Mrs. Hagelthorn, of Victoria, was one
of the most attractive. Mrs. Hennessy, the
Mayoress of Melbourne, who has been here
on a visit with her legal property, also
added the weight of a pleasing personality
to the junketing. Mrs. Donald Mackinnon’s
plump and amiable exterior was invariably
clothed in the latest Mode. Altogether,
Victoria’s feathers were very well to the
front. The Peacock ladybird, more quiet in
her plumage than some of the flock, sup-
plied a soft monotone to the mirthful screech
of her mate.
Major Charlie Gordon, of Inverell, adds
another six-foot-three of Australian manhood
to the toll of our dead in the Turkish pen-
insula. lie was a son-in-law of Archdeacon
Gunther.
Amy Castles, who sang here on Belgian
Day for the first time since her return, has
vastly improved as an artist. The old
slackness is passing. Signs of recent serious
study are delightfully in evidence. Amy’s
rich voice is more rounded in its top notes,
and she is more sympathetic in interpre-
tation. Her present form, in a gem from
“Butterfly” and in the Traviata excerpt, is
a loud Yes to the query: “Was she worth
the good Australian cash spent on her early
training in Paris?”
Justice Heydon, who is much given to
music himself, has a wife who has the same
kink. She wrote the words of “Give, Give,
Give,” sung by Derek Hudson at the
matinee on Belgian Day. The score was
by Arnold Mote.
Major Macnaghten, who is reported
wounded at the Dardanelles, was on the staff
of Governor Strickland for a while. He
was counted one of the best militiamen here-
abouts. As area-officer in a congested city
district, Macnaghten had a way with him
which convinced Percy that it was unwise
to repose against a corner post when he was
expected to straighten his spine on the drill
ground. A son of a former Scotland Yard
Chief, Melville Macnaghten, the wounded
hero was one of Sydney’s best hockey
players.
Amongst the names gazetted in the new
officers’ list is that of Fulke Prideaux-Brnne,
who married Kathleen Garvan. The Cor-
nishman goes to meet the enemy as a Cap-
tain and Adjutant of the Australian Im-
perial Force: _ ...
The ’Varsity Undergrads, are .going to do
their b'it for. Belgium next Saturday. ..The
Town Hall-will be .the scene of the,.outburst.
Chief Justice iCullen,, who is Chancellor of,
the Uni., will show his picturesque white
thatch in his official capacity. Adrian Ste-
phen has collaborated with two other drama-
tists, and dashed off a sketch for the occa-
sion. Reg Roberts, who always catches the
public ear in a topical ditty, is among those
booked to uplift their voices in a long pro-
gramme.
The annual meeting in connection with
Lewisham Hospital occurs this week. Gov-
ernor Strickland will clear his throat —there
is a prevailing atmosphere of cough—to ad-
dress the meeting. A concert to push a
comforting cheque into the hands of the
treasurer is to be held at the Town Hall on
June 30.
Colonel Reuter Roth was farewelled fre-
quently last week. He packs up his lancet
for the A.M.C. forthwith. The long, athletic
massage expert is a son of one of the first
well-known exponents of the art of thumping
you all over to make you well. Roth, sen.,
was a foreigner with a big massage practice
in London in the long ago.
The Hugh Mclntosh chalet at Darling
Point sheltered a Belgian ffte the other
afternoon. Percy Hunter grows thinner
than ever under his new job of caretaker of
the National Belgium Fund. So he easily
glided like a wraith through the crush to
declare the show open.
Someone writing of the Australian
society girl in Cairo, asks, “Would not
Vesta Tilley, who wanted to be a military
man, have thought it a stupid ambi-
tion to be anything but an Australian
woman, with a frock not more than one
yard round at the knees? There’s a style
about this Australian—a little bit American,
with a dash of the Parisian and a touch
of the London cockney, that makes her very
acceptable to what is left of Cairo society.
The Saturday night ‘small’ dances at the
Continental began timidly six weeks ago.
Now the Australian girl has made them
the rage, and to-night at 11 o’clock it will
take me 10 minutes to worm my way from
the foyer to the elevator. Her baggage, by
the way, which she has brought from her
native land, would be the envy of an army.”
Accountant Albert Borchard, who came to
this country in the days of his first knicker-
bockers, gave up his house at Wollstone-
craft, and the grounds thereof, to a Belgian
fete the other afternoon. A khaki band
blared patriotic tunes, and the local laity
and clerics strongly supported the Borchard
effort for the cause. One of the finest dis-
plays of the Allies’ bunting which any sub-
urban home has yet hung above its rosebeds
fluttered in the breeze. A huge Belgian flag
dominated the landscape, which was dotted
with lady bushrangers in the dress that
Brussels used to wear.
Mr. Bob Anderson’s eldest son took
his B.Sc. at Sydney Uni. before he asked
dad’s leave to enlist for the Big Fight. After
he had got joyfully into the togs of a full
private, his bosses found he had previously
private, his bosses found he had shouldered
arms as sergeant of the ’Varsity Scouts.
So they gave him the chance to read up for a
commission, and he leaves with the next
expedition as a dashing lieutenant.
Miss Maude Harvie, the Horses’ Nightin-
gale, has bustled oft: to Newcastle to stir
the mining population up to fresh efforts
for her pets. Poultice boots, bandages and
other comforts for the gee-gees who will
(d.v. ) carry our men to victory later on
are to come out of this Blue Cross raid.
Killed in France, Major Fred Parbury.
of the Field Artillery. A N.S.W. man, he
belonged to the family which gave its
name long ago to Parbury’s wharf.
Blamire Young, by the way, made a kind
of romance in misty blue paint of this pro-
saic jetty.
From an Australian girl in London: —
Went to an afternoon reception given by the A.N.A.
and held at the Reids’ place. The house was packed :
tea-room well patronised. I went in with the second
lot and found George still tucking in good and hard.
Stayed and talked, and the Court was still sitting
when I left. But he looks all his 70 years
now. The missus would easily pass for his daughter.
She wore that day a pretty purple frock, with lace
bertha and a purple band on her golden hair. Purple
is the color for middle age. London has done her
good.
The Women’s Handicrafts Society is still
pegging away in spite of a lessened demand
for stamped leather and poker work. It
intends showing its wares on several consecu-
tive days iu July.
Artist Joe Wolinski bobs up again iu
London. This time he is holding a show in
St. John’s Wood, where scribblers and
artists are cheek by jowl.
In the very plump and very smiling tenor.
Otto Sobell, has returned a South Aus.
native who has been for over 20 years on the
other side. Sobell began as a baritone, but
gave that up to rise higher as a grand-opera
tengr. Then he settled down jn London as
a teacher of voice production^Jin 3 has'jiow'

now close to his 80th milestone. To this
disinterested friend of a legion of infant
phenomena Sobell declares he owes his start
in musical life. Twenty-five years ago the
South Australian was in Sydney. Kretsch-
mann heard him sing, became enthusiastic,
and had him taught the piano at his expense.
Mrs. Sobell used to be pianist Viola Agnew.
of this State. Sobell himself was born
Fischer. His mother was one of the Sobeis
family, which has been growing vines in S.
Aus. for half a century.
Egerton Mills, a brother of Mrs. M. For-
rest, who writes so much good descriptive
verse from Brisbane, has a commission in the
lthodesian Rifles. He is now popping away
on Botha’s side of the argument in South-
West Africa. The Millses are old Parra-
matta people. I think it w r as grandpa Mills,
a schoolmaster, who first taught baby Parra-
matta that Britain is an island completely
surrounded by Australia’s good wishes.
The committee of the Kindergarten Union
held a meeting in the grounds of its Training
College the other afternoon. The guests were
invited to shake the hands of a few new
members of council. So everybody assem-
bled in a new class-room on the back lawn —
an architectural cross between a Burmese
tea-house and a large aviary with no sides.
Some curious experiments were there made.
In particular, there was a test to find out
whether the voices of speakers are improved
if accompanied by the fretting of a carpen-
ter’s saw complaining vociferously next door.
Nobody seemed to care fox’ the effect, though
the carpenter did not grumble. Mrs. Francis
Anderson addressed those present on the
ideal Kindergarten system of Belgium, and
the less ideal German method which fired
out individualism under iron-clad obedience
to Authority. Mrs. Clunies Ross added her
applause to the free Kindergarten system.
The secretary, with Miss Dumolo, the spec-
tacled young college principal, and Mrs. Dal-
ton afterwards filled the hungi’y with indi-
gestible things.
The deputation of local Poles who waited
on the wharf to welcome Melba the other
day nearly dropped the presentation bouquet
with surprise when the Voice greeted them
in the Polish language. Personally, I re-
main calm. The songstress is quite capable
of addressing any deputation in two-thirds
of the strange tongues that fell out of the
Tower of Babel.
Mrs. Cooper Day, the popular State
Children’s inspector, who went to Europe
just before the big row started, is organis-
ing a canteen for soldiers at Dieppe. Her
only son is at the Front.
The Sydney Needlework Guild, in spite of
the present tidal wave of socks, will show
its wares at Government House early this
week. Lady Edeline is a keen patron .of
the thimble, and years ago took an active
part in the Women’s big Exhibition in Mel-
bourne.
Artist Bertha Merfitdd is due here from
Melbourne. She put in some time in Lon-
don and Paris a while ago, and specialises
in decorative work. She intends to exhibit
in this city..
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

11l prehistoric times, primitive man’s first idea of
music was just noise, and was produced by bang-
ing two objects together. As times advanced,
however, and became more civilised, the idea of
music improved. Gradual advancement has
developed the modern Piano and Piano Player,
also those which, from less frequent use, may be
termed the “Lesser luminaries”- —the Violin and
other Stringed and Brass Instruments.
The full joy of music belongs to everyone, and is

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, May 17, 1915.
.My Dear Yaerie, —
Walter Kirby predominated at the “King
Albert’s Book” concert in the Town Hall
on Thursday night. In fact, lie sang most
of the programme. The King Albert Book
will contain the signatures of all those who
pay one pound (£1 > for the privilege of
figuring m it. They know that in the happy
days to come, when the Germans have been
kicked over the Bliine and Albert has leisure
to gather round his fireside and read,
he will take up his Book and say as lie
peruses it, “Ha! here is good old "Bulger’s
name, and here the signature of that fine
fellow Robinson." Whereat his family and
the Court will give three hearty cheers and
much rnauu will descend upon the names of
our patriots.
lo return to the concert, the programme
was pale gold, with a black and white pic-
ture, by Howard Chandler Christv, of Fame
crowning a soldier. This work of art was
sold by intellectual girls, mostly in spec-
tacles, who also did a brisk trade in sweets.
I lie ladies of the orchestra were dressed
in red skirts, yellow sashes and black bodi-
cettes, while the male performers secured my
warm sympathy by having to appear in
black velvet trouseretfes or pantlings, white
silk shirts and Belgian Hag cummerbunds,
two kliaki-clad men, from one of the camps
.joined the orchestra with their violins, and
the noise made by the audience was deafen-
tng. A large semi-circle of very small Bel-
gian-clad girls sat in the organ loft. I was
in the very act of puzzling out what on
earth they were there for when the con-
ductor made them sing “Rule Brit-
annia.” Some cruel things are done in the
name of Patriotism. Elsa Warman (who,
as you know, was the Pierrette in the latest
lutz Hart opera, Reginald Roberts being
her l ,rrot) performed, and so did that
nautiea ily-garmented prodigy, Cecil Parkes
—he ot the unmanageable violin. And
inail.v a man, to me unknown, recited a
harrowing battle piece about blood and re-
mains and so on, and another human mys-
tery sang an appeal to Britain entitled
Keep cool, John Bool,” just as if Bull had
not shown himself “ca’m as a ham” in the
greatest crisis in his history. The pro-
giamme was still winding on its intermin-
able length, with about 15 more laps to go
when, reflecting that Art is long, ' i
grabbed my faithful brolly and broke for
home.
An awful rumor says that two leading
patriotic enterprises are hotly contesting for
supremacy. It brings before the unedified
mental eye a picture of a shivering recruit
waiting for his warm undershirt, whilst two
enthusiastic females fight desperately in the
middle distance for the honor of handing it
to him.
Artist McCubbin’s son Hugh was wounded
at the Dardanelles the same week that his
brother went down with the Lusitania.
~w w ho is affectionately known as

\\ ith him is his new wife (she was Miss

staying at the Grand Hotel until l hey can
find a house and an umbrella-stand. By the
wav, the lady is the busy Weedon’s third
wife.
,'V., Patriotic bulldog show transpired in
the Gund Hall on Friday and Saturday. You
know what a bulldog looks like, and most of
those at the show looked like that, so I will
squander neither time nor ink in word-pic-
tures. As regards the humans, John Madden
opened the show on Friday with his cus-
tomary aplomb and a series of bright re-
marks about “Australians being the descend-
ants of British bulldogs,” and all that sort
o thing. And there were hundreds to ap-
plaud, while the exhibits barked and howled
their approval. A novel touch was intro-
duced by the dressing-up of different dogs for
pme-wmiiing purposes. Mrs. Andy Fisher
decided which animal wore the best clothes
1 he chosen was the property of Miss Allan,
and was got up as an armed naval officer.
Another of the weird-looking beasts was
garbed as a Red Cross nurse, and Mrs.
1 lggott won a prize with a dawg harnessed
to a Dreadnought. Miss McCance disguised
her property on one side as a Jack Tar and
the_ other as a soldier in khaki. Another
patient victim was wrapped in Union Jacks
Wallace Doctor, a famous champion brindle,
consented to have the trappings of a French
Pierrot, an enormous toby ruff round his neck
and fine harnessings of red, white and blue
on his body. None but a bulldog would have
the stoicism to stand such treatment.
The Fine Art Society’s room in the Centre-
way has been turned into a restful glade of
etchings, recently sent out by the London
Society of Twelve.” The pearl of the dis-
play is the “Demolition of St. James’s Hall,
London,” by Muirhead Bones. Gordon Craig,*
the apostle of the new art in the theatre,
summons bis troupe of trained phantoms for
bis part of the show. Sturge Moore, the
poet who tilled in the gaps in Wilde’s “Flor-
entine Tragedy,” is represented by several
book-covers of distinctive design. I>. T.
Cameron has studies of the sculpture of old
Egypt, and suspends some colored drawings
of dour Scawtch hills. Francis Dodd etches
some notable people, including General
Booth, and exhibits a dainty study of Green-
wich suggestive of Whistler. Other exhibi-
tors of note include Clauscen and two
Strangs, and there is a startling study of
It. B. Cunninghame Grahame by Rothen-
stein.
Mrs. Crevelli’s party-concert in aid of
the lied Cross of France filled the Masonic
Hail with persons of moment and millinery.
Lady Helen was there in the fed which she
so loves—a dull red dress beneath which
shone a giddy little pair of crimson slippers.
Rubies trimmed her head and neck, and the
whole effect was glowing. The Madden
dame was again enveloped in a mantle of
what looked like red plush. Her husband
and Edward Miller fought bitterly, with
drawn cheque-books, for flags. Napoleon
Bollard made £SO auctioning bunting,
and the cutest French girls available
did good business as programme ven-
dors. Singing and other musical noises
went on all the time. Carmen Del-
prat gave a performance, which was
hardly so brilliant a success as her
hair. This hair was dressed in a lofty
mound, and was surrounded by green leaves.
Sister Paquita and the explorer brother-in-
law were there to hear her. One of the
singers fa Mrs. Somebody-or-other-hyphen-
Campbell) looked beautiful, wore a beauti-
ful gown, and aired a beautiful voice. Added
to all these virtues was Modesty. She had
a train, and in her bashfulness found great
difficulty in managing both her voice and it
in the awful publicity of a platform. The
Railway Orchestra Chorus sang a stirring
chorus from “Faust” (an unexpected thing
for a Railway Chorus to do, somehow),
and altogether the party was a big success.
Did I tell you how charming Mrs. Crevelli
looked in black?
From my Adelaide correspondent:—-
The Governor was at the races on hoth Goodwood
and Adelaide Cup days, with Lady Galway, Miss
d’Erlanger, Miss Macaulay, and Mr. Mulholland—•
who, by the way, is oft' to the war. But it was a
somewhat depressing' function, all the same. Raven-
spur gave his backers over £46 in the First Hurdles
on Saturday, and Citus paid £l6 odd in the Nursery
Handicap on Monday. To-day .it is blowing a typhoon
and raining buckets, so the chances are that the
festival will fall to pieces.
A. E., Davey’s son has .got a commission in the
British Naval Air Service, and H. Burton Ware has
gone into the R.F.A.
Alice Grant Rosman’s book, “Miss Bryde of Eng-
land,” -whose publication was postponed by the out-
bleak of the war, has just made its appearance in
England. She has been struggling to get to the
Front to collect “impressions,” but it can’t be done.
Lieut. L. Hawker, of the Royal Flying Corps, who
recently got his D. 5.0., is a son of the late Lieut..
H. C. Hawker, R.N., and a grandson of the
G. C. Hawker who was one of this State’s early
settlers and its frequent Treasurer and Minister for
Works. -
The May. Club has established a Musical Circle.
Despite the war, our. “Culture” continues to-boom.
The Alliance Frangaise has thriven so that it finds
the May Club rooms too small for it, and has re-
moved itself to the Lister Hall.
Amongst the doctors going to the Front are J. E.
M. Wigley and L. J. Pellew. The latter took his
degree at the Adelaide University in 1905, and has
practised since then at Balaclava and Port Augusta.
Dr. 'Wigley is a son of ex-starter “Tom” Wigley, of
this State.
... Mr. Fred, Chappie, the old chief of Prince Alfred
College, was formally bound over to be a C.M.G. at
Government House on Thursday morning on the
sureties of John Downer and L. H. Sholl. It seems a
pity, after so useful a life.
The engagement is announced of the J. H. Shiels
only daughter to the elder of the two George Brook-
man sons.
The South-East, where the potatoes come from,
and where Randolph Bedford and some other people
are looking- for oil, has a relative of General French-
Miss B. M. French—as the sec. of its War Fund
Committee. The ladies of those parts, with Mt.
Gambier as headquarters, have already scraped
together two motor-ambulances.
I see in a cable that the King of Spain
was 20 last week. . An A.D.C. or Governor
or butler or something once told me a pretty,
though doubtless completely mendacious,
story about him. Princess Ena, as she then
was, bad been to stay in Spain, and she
wrote to her betrothed saying that never
since she returned to London had she tasted
such oranges as were supplied to her in the
land of her future spouse. A mere Prahran
or Collingwood lover might have posted her
a dozen in a box “for remembrance.” Al-
fonso had an entire tree, in full bearing, dug
up. replanted into a vast case, bound with
streamers of black and yellow (his colors)
and consigned on a fast steamer to England.
As he is one of the richest monarchs in the
world, it was no more to him than a visit to
the local picture show is to some of our
suburban dashers. Still the idea was pictur-
esque. That is to say, if it was ever con-
ceived, which is questionable. Most things
are questionable about kings, barring then-
ages, and, as I remarked before, Alfonso is
29.
Mrs. Roger Thompson, of Malvern, and
Miss Edith Hope Campbell, are organising
a Ladies’ Rifle Club. Mayor Thompson
already belongs to one, and there does his
bit _ for the Empire with the utmost intre-
pidity several times weekly. But this insti-
tution bars wives and sweethearts by rigid
law. Hence the movement above mentioned.
Miss Campbell is, of course, a crack shot
already. The Mayoress hopes to be able
to hit the running deer, or bolting German,
or whatever it is live times out of six within
the next fortnight. They are already get-
ting depressed about it in Potsdam, I under-
stand.
The Australian branch of the Red Cross
has issued a balance-sheet, covering its
operations from 13th August, 1914, to Stli
April.. Total receipts were £101,162, and
£92,448 was sent to High Commissioner
Reid through the Commonwealth Bank, free
of charge. Of the other £8719 there was
£4774 in hand, after paying for two motor-
ambulances (£1050) and all sorts of medi-
cal comforts and surgical necessaries at this
end. _ The. business expenses, apart from
packing, freight, cartage and insurance, were
£BlO for wages and £ll3 for printing, sta-
tionery, travelling exes, and petties. It
couldn’t have been much less.
The Melba Gift Book is almost hatched.
I don't quite know who is guarding the
incubator at present. The editor, Frank-
lin Petersen, is acting as Associate to Jus-
tice Higgins for the moment, and I sup-
pose even one of his energy could hardly
edit and associate at the same time.
loung Rex Cooke, of Toorak, is among
the wounded. lie was a parson in embryo
when the Kaiser .started to run amok.
Mrs. Hodges, the Judge’svwife,. is raking in
crowns for the Belgian Fund by selling bulbs
grown at the Macedon domicile. (Her garden
is famed for The 'variety, beauty 'and size of
its daffodils and ttillpk
Major Eccles Snowden, who only waited
to settle his considerable wealth on his wife
and babe before enlisting, has been given
out leg before" in the Dardanelles. He is
a. nephew of Argus editor Cunningham,
whose male relatives, nmftvjiunor to them,
are mostly in the li®f •-including
brother Bob, the silver-voiced tenor.
1 went the other night to a picture theatre
which shows films of the Panama Exposition.
Alfred Deakin is depicted talking and pre-
senting and being- presented with things,
while Mrs. Alfred stands gracefully, by, with
a lovely feather in her hat. The huge Aus-
tralian pavilion is a feature, likewise its
placards inscribed: “No Cowbarns necessary
in the Winter.” But the star portion of the
show is the motor race. This event has all the
thrill and much of the gore of an.old Roman
chariot sprint. The cars rip along an
avenue ’of palms.. Great bales of straw are
piled at the turns, but some of the skidding
vehicles miss these and hit iron posts instead.
It is fierce. Other notable points are the
Eiffel Tower and the sparsity of visitors. I
suppose the latter has to do with the war.
Do you wonder that President Wilson is re-
ported to have fractured the holiness of his
almost oppressively saintly home, on several
occasions of late, with the words: “Blow the
War I”
Tady Mackworth, who seems to have been
saved from the Lusitania horror, is mamma-
l-law to our little Leonie Peterson. Leonie’s
husband was fighting the Turk on the Galli-
poli peninsula at latest advices.
Major Quilter has been killed—in the
usual manner. He became a Lieut.-Colonei
before lie fell. He was military secretary to
Lord Denman until he came into the family
titlei and wealth on his father’s death. He
was a large, amiable Guardsman with a
countenance which belied the reputation he
held of being one of the best bridge-players:
in England. He always reminded me, so far
as his appearance was concerned, of Thack-
eray’s Kawdon Crawley—the large, simple,
good-humored soldier-sportsman who married
Becky Sharp.
Commodore-Purser J. McCubbin, who
ivent down ivith the Lusitania, was a
brother of artist Fred. He had been with
the Cunard people for over 40 years, and
A'/as editor of the first Avireless neAvspaper
published at sea.
Gladys Taylor, avlio is a barrister by
profession, but looks SAveetly feminine and
combines gentle Avays with independent
views, last week took unto herself a hus-
band. The lucky man was R. E. Hain, a
brother barrister in time of peace, but now
a lieutenant with the expeditionary force.
Before lie Avent to some place that the cen-
sor says I must not mention, though it’s
quite respectable, he was presented by the
Bar of Victoria with a pair of field-glasses.
Hallelujahs from, the dossers and confu-
sion to Mother Grundy! The gates of Carl-
ton Gardens are just taken off their hinges;
but a bobby goes round at dawn with the
benevolent object of prodding any late-
sleepers. Meanwhile suburban Little Ped- '
.lingtons carefully lock up reserves where
there is not herbage for a goat, and where
the population is so stodgy that it really
ought to be given facilities to hug its
neighbor’s daughter in the evenings.
Have you heard the latest and only infal-
lible recipe for a good complexion? It is
measles. If you are just parching for a good
skin, catch measles, wait for the peeling
process, and thereafter take sedulous care of
tlm new hide. I. am not hoping to popu-
larise measles; but, after all, the humorous
infantile ailment is easily contracted, and
is not half as uncomfortable or inconvenient
as two-thirds of the drastic remedies for
skin blemishes in popular use. Measles
rejuvenate the skin in a remarkable manner,
and if I could sell them in a suitable dis-
guise, under a seductive title, I could get
half a guinea a pot for a million pots a year.
Captain Hore-Ruthven, Y.C., who was
Military Secretary to Lord Dudley in Aus-
tralia. has joined the newly-formed Welsh
Guards. This gives him the distinction of
having served in regiments of pretty well
every nationality in the Empire. He started
in a militia battalion of the Highland Light
Infantry (Scotch), and'next joined a Camel
Corps in the Soudan (Egyptian) Army.
He got his V.C. at Gadaref, and at the end
of the war was gazetted to the Cameron
Highlanders. He served in Ireland, where
lie was A.D.C. to Lord Aberdeen ; in Aus-
tin 1 in'; and in India, where he entered the
St.-yi College. After that he joined the
King’s Dragoon Guards, which is English.
He has two brothers; both are D.S.O.’s, and
both were twice mentioned in despatches and
given the Queen’s and King’s medals. They
are the sort of strenuous Highlanders to
whom fighting is a pastime.
From an Australian nurse now in London :
The average woman in England still thinks of u.-
as foreigners. One sister told me the other day that
she hoped we would remain friendly after the war.
The War Office is hard put to it to get enough
nurses. Girls scarcely trained are being taken for
some jobs. God knows, it needs experience and pluck
to get through with the kind of eases we had over in
France. Here, where I am now, having something
of a rest, each ward has its staff and equipment at
hand; a;nd we growl like bears if we have 20 cases
over in a day. Out there we got a couple of hundred
a day, and had hardly any conveniences—water had
to be boiled outside in tins.—and only, wounded men
to help.
I am sorry the girls coming- from Australia haven’t
a distinctive uniform. The Canadians look very well
in warm navy-blue overcoats and blue sailor hats.
Bonnets and circular cloaks are out of place if a
nurse has to do field work, and for summer use they
will he most unsuitable. It was so hot in Belgium in
September that we couldn’t have done our work in
the regulation rig. It isn’t too late now to give the
Australian girls something distinctive.
Tile luckiest men in this war are the wounded
soldiers who are brought back to London for hospital
treatment. They are having the time of their lives.
Motors come every day and take them out. One day a
lady drove up with a carriage and pair arid invited
three invalids—any three—to go for an airing. She was
turned down by the Tommies. They got three Bel-
gians to go, but even they went reluctantly. In the
days of motor-cars carriage’s are a bit too slow.
Tickets for theatres, picture shows and hotel concerts
fall in galore. Good artists come and perform in,j
the wards. But Tommy gets very restless ririless it's)
a comic of “Tipperary.” After the Temple Choir 1
had given a very good concert one East-Ender told
me it “nearly stiffened” him.
But they make good patients, and, considering what
they have gone througV-it’s-up to the General-Public
to treat them well. Ip spite of what I’ve read, I’ve
riot met any anxious to go back; but some have gone,
and one at least we knew has been killed since.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

IF BILIOUS OR CONSTIPATED TAKE
“CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.”
Harmless “fruit” laxative cleanses
stomach, liver and bowels without
griping or discomfort.
An acid stomach, clogged with fermenting,
ill-digested food, means that the liver is not
doing its duty. Nature provided ripe fruit
juices to keep the liver up to its work.
"California Syrup of Figs” is a deliciously
refreshing fruit laxative which is always in
season. You can keep it at hand, and it
will be an unfailing friend whenever the
tongue is coated, bowels sluggish, breath
foul, throat dry or sore, stomach full of
wind, and head hot and aching. You can
take a dose whenever it is needed, as safely
iis you could eat fresh fruit. In a short
while you will feel the benefit. The bowels
will be gently relieved, and the stomach
cleansed and sweetened as the undigested
food is moved on and got rid of. The tongue
will grow clean again and the head, will be
cooled and cleared. There is no mistaking
the beneficial effects of “California Syrup
of Pigs.” Directions are with it for adults
and children of all ages. This pleasant
laxative is good for all, and cannot possibly
haim even the mogt delicate, but you must
ask for "California Syrup of Figs,” and look

“Outcast” : In tlie late German colony of
Kaiser 'Wiihelmsland flogging was the method of
keeping Black Brother in order, and a man's rank
in the service could be gauged by how many cuts
along the butt-end of a nig. he was entitled to
bestow. A plain ten-cuts-along chap was only very
light lager beer indeed, and T don’t know to what
dizzy height a twenty-cutter had soared. Under
the new Brit-Australian military administration the
same system is maintained, except that the general
public can partake in the. dealing out of law and
order. I don’t know the scale of precedence vet, but
1 shouldn’t imagine a lieutenant (lately promoted
from a Melbourne bank) would be allowed less
cuts-along than a German police-master. On the
Papuan side of the border it's worth from five to
40 shillings of anybody’s good cash to as much as
look sideways at a nig. How is the Commonwealth
going to reconcile things? *

“E.S.S.”: The first bird that claims the
attention of the man with a. gun when approaching
swamps and lagoons is the spurwinged plover. It is
the alarm clock of the marches, its loud, clear note
giving warning to all the water-haunters of the pre-
sence of an enemy. It is singularly alert, and
shows much cunning. When accompanied by young
ones it will endeavor to avoid notice by slinking
quietly off or standing slightly crouched. But the
attempt is a failure. With its sheeny, golden-brown
upper surface and black head, nape and. sides, its
yellow wattles and bill, white breast and reddish-
yellow legs it is too boldly marked to escape observa-
tion. The spurtviiigs are mostly feeding in pairs or
little flocks on dry .fand in the open, and are so wary
that, no matter how stealthily they are stalked, they
are rarely surprised. Often they will fly round the
gunner, uttering their warning notes, which enables
the ducks to locate his position. They are excellent
eating, but nobody who is after ducks wants to shoot
at them until the other game have flown. This the
plover seems to know, for when it is stalked it keeps
well out of range, if the stalker ivies' to creep up
behind a tree it-will either get beyond reach of that
tree as soon as it of him, or run out at.
right angles to see-wsjjjtat lie is up to. It is a graces
fur and attractive bi&ftiy-noisy when disturbed, and at
times cheeky, and pugfeacious. If a person encroach is
too ,neai : its "-nest, -which is merely a-slight depression
under a tussock, it quickly acquaints him of the fact
by circling round him and making vicious darts at
bis head. A blow with the sharp spur on either
wing is not (he catch of the season. Generally it is
tlie intruder's hat that is assaulted. The magpie is
also addicted to this habit, but it swoops silently at
the passing' traveller, who is startled from his reverie
by the sudden snap of powerful mandibles within
an inch of his scalp. The plover at times resorts
to strategy to lure the traveller away from her nest.
She will run along in front of him, uttering no
sound, and keeping only a few paces away, sometimes
hopping on one leg, sometimes dragging a wing, as
though wounded. A person unacquainted with the
ways of plovers will attempt to run her down, and
as soon as she has drawn him beyond the danger
zone she rises with a triumphant cry and assumes her
aggressive tactics, while the dupe stands open-
mouthed, staring after her.

their spawn. The Papuan, who is keen on nature
study, knows this, and all round Goodenough Bay-
sets traps of basket-ware filled with the weed. The
flying fish comes along and settles down into these
convenient receptacles, whereupon the trap is
promptly hauled in to the canoe and Brown Brother
keeps the fun going until he has enough fish for
supper.
DAD'S SUPERIOR DEVIL.
THE PARSON: "Do yon see the power of the
Devi? He is drawing those men into that
place of sin.”
THE BOY (acquainted with that domestic
demon , the forest devil): That's nothin'!
Yer oughter see me dad drawin' stumps."

I wanted some ploughing done, so took on an old
soldier who “knew all about the game." I left him
to it, but went back in an hour to waioh things,
lie was having trouble with one of the horses —it
wouldn’t follow the furrow. So he got off the plough,
tapped the animal on the shoulder, and said: “Look
here; that s no —— good! This is how it’s
done,’’ and walked along the furrow for 20 yards
to show what winn wanted. Then he came back
and looked hard . horse: “Now see if vou can
do better. Git
“Faddy Melon” : The best place in Aus-
tralia to learn how to make a damper is aiong- the
Cooper River (Q,). There in the big mustering camps
the following ingredients are used. One large bag of
flour, plenty of “jump up” and water to mix with,
and, of course, good gidyea ashes. The mass is well
punched, and then dumped into the ashes, covered
up with more ashes, and allowed to cook for half a
day. After it is cooked the chef scrapes the ashes
off with a shovel, and the mass is ready for about
30 hungry musterers. . The largest dampeis. I ever
saw was on Galway Downs. It was 6ft. round.
”B. ’: “Billy” Woods, a tvelf-'tetfhtvn
pioneer in the little old Scottish settlement at the
|tail end of Maoriland where the boys daren’t whistle
H on Sunday and the girls have no, glad eye (at least,
shardly ever), told me how vrabbits reached
Southland. “Billy” arrived at "'the Bluff, with
a Captain Brown, in the steamer Alham-
bra, in 1866, and this Brown brought a cage of
bunnies. His idea was to take up land and make his
harm Homfijike. lie liberated the animals and awaited
results. |“W11 have a beautiful turn-out in a couple
•of year|/ Billy,” he said. ! I<- was right. The turn-
out arrived io timetable, and Brown went back to
ki-gland, broke. "Billy took to selling- beer to keep
the rabbits from his door.
“Norbell”: Out in Charlevilie (Q.) tlie
other day l met a fiery-faced- squatter industriously
pouring champagne into himself and anyone else
who happened along. After the umteenth bottle I
suggested that it was a fair thing. “No fear, ol’
man,” said he. “I’ve gorra motive orderin’ wine.
Warrerbags!” He winked knowingly, and showed me
a pocketful of corks. “On’y way t’ get ’em. Sad-
dler out on run makin’ new warrerbags, an’ bes’
stoppers for warrerbags in all wort’ is champagne
corks!” Then he procured corks for several more
waterbags.
‘’Pick”: I can tell "Yancy” (B. 29/4/’l5)
this much about the pasturing of cows on lucerne.
To cud-chewing animals it is not hasty feeding so
much as the gaseous nature of the vegetable that
causes blowing. Also, when accustomed to it they
are rarely affected ; whereas when the tucker is new
to them, five minutes’ feeding will blow hungry
cattle. A fairly safe rule is to feed them on lucerne
sparingly at fir.-l, and increase the helping each day;
but, until you want the hides, never allow the beasts
upon the h e, me when it is wet.

high up in the bill?, and only turn up every couple
of y ears to be fleeced, I saw one shorn at Inverleigh
(lie.) —a six-tooth merino wether—and the fleece
turned the scale at 19111). This was net, meaning
that it had been skirted of belly' and pieces. The
bale which included this wool realised 15fd. per lb.,
which meant £1 as. Cd. for the one fleece.

THE LITERARY PUBKEEPER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The licensee of the hotel could not read, and could
write only sufficiently to sign his name. The woman
to whom the license was transferred could neither
read nor write. It appeared to bo a question deserv-
ing serious consideration whether complete illiteracy
of this description should not constitute unfitness
for the position.— Mr. Justice Street ( N.S.W. ).
When Shamus O'Brien took charge of the pub down
at Bogan,
Yon bet there was plenty of dealin’s and lots of
colloguin' ;
The police made inquiries with quite an unusual
labor—-
They found him a straight-speakin’ man, and a well-
actin’ neighbor;
lie ruled in the parlor and bar for a long generation,
And never a mail bad a finer all-round reputation ;
And nobody ventured to ask (for he wouldn't have
heeded)
If he carried a college diploma like Father Magee
did.
Two hundred miles northward and southward his pub
it was famous.
There was always a balance on cheques if you left
them with Shamus ;
A woman could learn not to weep for a husband
gone drinkin’,
I °r Shamus would sober him up, and would set the
man tliinkin’.
llieie was many who swore by O’Brien, and praised
and admired him:
“Drink’s no fri’nd to you,” be would say to a man
as lie fired him;
Yes, me (the dam’ fool of me!) still would have left
a wife eryin’
If'it wasn’t for truth's that were told me bv Shamus
O’Brien.
Was he college-bred? Lord, when the letters come
in of a Friday,
It was me that would do the replyin’, well spelled and
wrote tidy;
For, though Shamus could talk man to man with the
boss of a station,
If he knew a bull’s foot from a B ’twas his whole
education!
So there come a bad day when the judges sent out
their new rulin’,
do put publicans all through exams., with their
figures and foolin’ ;
They went right through the pubs of the country—
the sooner the quicker—
And that was the end of poor Shamus in servin’ of
liquor.
So we got a new landlord, with books on the shelf
like a college—•
Kven Father Magee had to own that the divil had
knowledge.
He kept ledgers that thick they would do for a store
or a draper,
And with never a word spoke aloud when he read
in the paper;
’Twas a fellow could make you a speech like the
member’s, or faster—
He was maybe a Master of Arts, for he drank like a
master;
And we found pretty soon that them highly-learnt
sort can be handy
Beyond what the most of us is with a bottle of
brandy.
There s a truth to be told, and it's neither surprising
nor recent—
When the landlord drinks late, then good-bye to the
pub that is decent. ‘
If this cove got a .thirds no had a chance of
refusin’, b
He had long recitations to prove there was virtue
in boozin’ y#
They were chunks out of Wadsworth, and Shecly,
and Bryan, and others—-
When him and the teacher got soused they would
sing ’em like brothers;
Them fellers could keep on recitin' till near paraletie,
And the drunker they got, they was all the more
extra-poetic.
The Judges perhaps had their reasons, there's never
no tellin’,
for savin’ that landlords in pubs must be bonzers
at spellin’;
But I have a right jest as much to my own preju-
liction
That their spellin’ won’t save ’em the third and
the final conviction.
Yes, that was the end of the feller that made us
disgusted—
It was tradin’ on Sunday in which at the finish he
busted;
So O’Brien’s been back in the pub since the end of
October—
He ain’t an M.A., but he knows how to keep himself
sober.

Don’t let your Soda Fountain lie
idle during winter, when you can
make big money by supplying Hot
Drinks.
There was a time when Soda-
fountain owners who invested in
Hot Soda Apparatus did not make
much money in hot drinks —the
patrons had to be educated to ap-
preciate hot drinks. But the
public now knows all about these
beverages, likes them, and there is
plenty of evidence that the demand
for them is increasing. It pays
to keep the fountain open during
the winter months, for the trade
is becoming greater from year to
year, and pi-ofits in consequence are
becoming larger and larger.
With a little energy on the part
of the operator the Hot Soda
Business can be so developed that
it will be a close second in volume
to the summer sales of cold foun-
tain beverages.
The “Perfecto,” as illustrated, is
the best Winner for Trade in the
hot-beverage department that has
yet been put befox-e the public. You
can draw boiling water in a stylish
and up-to-date manner.
Just drop in one of our flavoring
cubes, stir, and serve as delicious
and nourishing a drink as it is
possible to produce.
We have a large supply of
Armour’s Bouillon Cubes and other

RECIPE TO DARKEN GREY
HAIR.
By a Specialist.
A very satisfactory preparation .which
darkens grey ha r and acts as a corrective
agent for dandruff and other diseases of the
scalp can be made at small expense and in
your own home by dissolving a small box of
Orlex Compound in 7oz. of water and then
adding an ounee of bay rum and a quarter
ounce of glycerine. Any chemist can fur-
nish these ingredients. ThV is to be applied
once a week until the liair is sufficiently dark-
ened, then every two weeks to keep the
hair soft and glossy and the scalp in a
healthy condition. It may be used with
equal success in darkening the beard. This
is a preparation that gives splendid results,
both as a hair-darkener and as a remedy for
all scalp disorders, and is well worthy of a
trial. You will find it far superior "to the
ordinary stock preparations and much less
expensive. [l2

“Sammy”: If it rains here in the
Riverina soon I know a lot of cocldes who are going
to he washed out. It is the same after every drought.
Tiie first good year after a bad spell the straw that’s
left after stripping is cut and used to roof the sheds
and Sometimes the houses. It is piled on from two
io three feet thick. It stays there till the next
drought. Then cocky tackles the roof first of his sheds
and finally of his shanty, sometimes 10 years old, with
a hit of cocky-chaff as an appetiser. My lot have fin-
ished all the roofs and have started on the bark off
the stable. But it isn’t fattening.
“De Oriel”: Abcut Tasmania’s ancient
pubs and other less important houses. The most his-
torical hotel in the South is surely the one at Port
Arthur. This building was an official residence in the
penal days. The traveller can still secure his door
with broad-arrow bolts quite as thick as his wrist;
and the bar is “gay” .with relies of the bad old
days when the neighbors would take their 50 before
breakfast in the infamous old flogging ground.
“PUB TIME.”
"Seen Habert lately I”
"Yes! 'E left ’ere three drinks ago.”
"Billy Blue”: “Six-and-eiglit” says (B.
22/4/’l5) that some departmental satrap wrongly
spelt the name of Bowenfels on the railway name-
board. Bowenfels was so spelled long before a rail-
way reached the spot. In “Wells’s Gazetteer,” pub-
lished 1848, I find: “Bowenfels—A town of N.S.W.,
County Cook, at Bowen’s Hollow.” Dr. Lang, a Scotch-
man, passed through it in 1851, and tells us that
“Bowenfels is a rising village.” It was named after
G. M. C. Bowen, of Mount Toniah, who bought the
land thereabouts in the ’4o’s, and the place was
then known as Bowen’s Hollow. When the town was
laid out it was called Bowenfels. 1 know of no
authority for spelling it “Bowenfells” except one
comparatively modern gazetteer.

“The Keefer”: Old Bill, the carpenter,
sent his nigger Cuba for a crosscut saw. Just
around the corner he met a few pals and sat with
them for a whiff at the bau-bau. Then his young
brother came over in a canoe from Ilannabada, and
Cuba, native-like, wanted him to do his work. “Ky,
Joni, ..you go catchem saw.” Joni: “I no savvy
saw. Which way I go catchem?” Cuba: “What!
You all-a-same plurrv foolu, you no savvy saw. You
no savvy him brother belonga akis (axe), man he

British gunner's description of the cries
of the wounded and dying war horses:—
The noise they made was like the grizzling of a
child that is not well- -a. aery pitiful sound, but, of
course, on a much bigger scale; and that sound of
tiering went up from everywhere around us, because
everywhere there were wounded horses.

“Vergeinout”: “Rag” (B. 4/3/T5) is
wrong when he tries to make heartleaf poisoning
identical with the “Birdsville” horse disease. The
shrub doesn’t grow anywhere about the Lower Cooper
or Diamantina; it belongs to the desert country,
although there are small patches growing on the
tablelands in and around Opalton. Hungry stock
that breakfast on heart-leaf usually pass in their
alley before lunch. They do not go blind or take
long walk-abouts as those do that suffer from the
Birdsville trouble.
“Billy T.”: We were waiting for an
eccentric little toy train to run away with us down
the mountain; meanwhile we found interest in the
argument in the bar. The tall man, with one boot
and half a shave, who was hanging on to the re-
mains of a long beer, was expressing his determina-
tion to utterly destroy Dan Hyde wherever and
whenever he met the said Daniel. The tall man went
into details; he would batter Hyde with his fists
till Hyde could no longer stand ; then he would tread
Hyde’s remains into the dust. “Wish I ’ad me other
boot on,” he said as an afterthought. “Why,” asked
Graham, the publican, “what’s this Hyde clone?”
“He’s run off with me wife,” said the tail man.
“Garni” said Graham. “Garn!” said two customers.
“Wot rot!” ejaculated-the small, inflamed millhand,
who was drinking rum. “Anyone ’d think yid bin
done in. Run away with yer wife! Wishterblazes
he’d run away with mine!” “And mine,” sniffed
another boosican. “S’elp me, yorter be ’shamed iv
yerself,” said Graham angrily, “kickin’ up sich a
stink over nothink. There’s thousan’s ’d like t’
be in yor shoes, lemme tell yeh.” “Hear, hear!”
chorused the boosicans. “Wish yid gimme this Hyde
feller s haddress,” said the millhand. “The man what
has his wife run off with ’n’ growls erbout it ain’t got
no scents of gratertude,” snorted a sodden black-
smith. The tall man vacillated ; his case was weak-
ened in the face of hostile public opinion. “Well,”
he said lamely, . “the cow might 'ave arsked my
consent.”
“Silas Snell”: Michael Pine came of a
clan that knew how to cherish a grievance. Michael's
own grievance dated from his schoolboy days, when
Steve Hennessy, suspecting him of systematic pillage
in the orchard of quinces and pears, waylaid him, and
was a stern father to him for a space of seven
minutes. The implement of correction Avas a two-
foot length of inch hose. AA'hen all was over Michael
was too full for utterance, but the next day the boy
stood outside Hennessy’s garden, and pitched his
yarn through the pickets. “I’ll not misremember
what yell done by me, Misther Steve Hinnissy, if 1
live t’ be a huntherd,” said he. “ ’Tisn’t fer me, a
poor boy, t' thry ,’n’ bate yell now, you a grown
man, but there’ll come wan day, Steve Hinnissy, whin
you’ll be ould, ’n’ cowld, ’n’ wake, ’n’ I’ll be hot ’n’
sthrong. Then yell can be lookin’ out fer me, Hin-
nissy, ’n’, sure ez Hell, I’ll come to yeh, wid a bit
of hose ’n‘ bate'the bones out iv yer bag. I will
that.” Hennessy threw a clod of earth at him, and
Michael Pine went away for 25 years. Then he came
back, a man of 38, and Stei’e Hennessy, by this lime
a man well over 70, ivas pottering along a toav of
cabbages AVith a hoe. Steve stood before him, a
tivo-foot length of inch hose in his hand, and, said
lie: “Maybe, yj 11 remimber me, Steve Hinnissy? Me
name is Pine.” Old Hennessy looked him over. “I
mind yeh, Miekie Pine,” said he. “Yer (lie bye 1
licked AA’ell ’n’ plenty fer the stealin’ iv me quinces.”
“Then,” said Pine, “ye’ll rimimber me solemn pro-
mise t’ return AA'an iv thim days, ’n’ be aven Avid
jeh?” “I’ve a clare recolliction iv it,” said llcn-
uessy, and Avent on Avith his lioeing. “Well, Hinnissy,
yeh slnvine iv the wor-rld,” said Pine, “the day has
come for me t’ be givin’ yeh back what yeh give me.”
With that Pine rushed the old man. Steve fenced
him off Avith the hoe, but had taken one skelp that
Staggered him when Michael Pine found himself
attacked in the rear. He turned, and put up a fight,
Avhile old SteA'e Hennessy, seated on a barroAV, calmly
judged the progress of the battle. Pine Avas licked,
and AA'hen thoroughly done AA'as throAvn over the garden
fence, and as he sat up, half-dazed, rubbing his hurts,
SteA'e Hennessy introduced the conqueror. “ ”J’is me
son,” ho said, “Steven Hennessy, junior. I married
since, man, ’n’ brought up a fine bye, as ye’ll see fer
yersilf. Did yeh think, Pine, me knoAvin’ the breed
of yeh. 1 d be the fool Avouldn’t make provision fer
a day like this?”
“Pick ’: The Avombat is the one and only
species of Australian fauna that can claim an increas-
ing birth-rate. He has spread from his erstAvliile
haunts in jungle-land over districts Avhere formerly
he Avas unknown, and fences, proof against other Aving--
less animals, are no barrier to him. A Avestern P. P.
Board recently Avent bankrupt in its efforts to head
him off Avith a 10s. scalp bonus, and farmers Avhose
pumpkin-fields he raids are breathing hard and sAvear-
ing that something will haA'c to be done. AAombats
religiously disdain every form of bait, and are, there-
fore, unaffected by phosphorus and cyanide. Also,
their thick hide presents an armored casing against
attacks from fox, dog and dingo.
- ‘Tick": -There are too many fancy bakers
precipitating themselves into this damper-making
argument. To use any raising ingredient is not
regarded as bush etiquette. Flour, water and salt,
without measurements, are alone permissible, but, to
add a gum-leaf twang it is allowable to mix and
knead the dough on a sheet of green bark, the inner
side of which has been scorched. The oven is a hole
filled with glowing dry bark ashes. One other in-
gredient is necessary—a touch of luck. With that
in, the feast will do for me, and I’m a bit particular.
A unique instinct Avas given a run in
recent poultry trials at the Hawkesbury Agricultural
College (N.S.W.). A test of judgment in the selec-
ion of laying hens was held, and the event was won
,’asily by the only woman competitor, all of whose
chosen 31 lady birds proved good layers. The next-
best competitor selected 38, but only 26 of them
bore abundant fruit; and the other competitors were
hopelessly out.

“Grenada”: “Tridit’s” description of the
“bullrout" (B. 8/4/’lf>) is rather mixed. The bull-
rout (or “bullrat,” if you like) does not possess a
battery of spikes all over him. That is the '“prickly
toad,” a balloony sort of fish which somewhat re-
sembles a prickly cucumber. lie is as dangerous as
a bream. The bullrout is another contrivance alto-
gether. He belongs to the cod family, and is often
mistaken for the ordinary rock-cod of N. S. AVales.
lie grows to nine or 10 inches, and is brown and
muddy in color. His chief points are at the end of
his fins. A wound from them is the prelude to blood-
poisoning of a violent nature. Fishermen on the
North Coast often grab a bullrout in mistake for a‘
mullet or black bream, and the victim generally
needs his mates’ care for the next couple of hours.

“Darnoc”: The honesty of the average
Kanaka in Rabaul, despite the introduction of the
missionary and the soldier, is marvellous. lie won’t
steal a biscuit, even if he is hungry. AYe had the
black-skinned high-priest of absolute honesty in our
machine-gun mess. His name was Silo, and he was
a sort of maid of all work. One day Silo saw one
of our men who was highly inebriated literally scatter
his money to the winds. Next morning the soldier
had forgotten the episode, but along comes Silo to
the sergeant and says: “bast night him fellow plenty
too muebee drinkum whisky, throw plenty money
ground; me feller pick him up.” He handed the
sergeant every penny that was lost —£4 18s. To
mark the nigger's honesty we passed round the hat
and handed him 18s. The nig. placed the money in
a drawer in the kitchen and then —well, one of our
own Tommies was mean enough to sneak 10s. of
it. Some of us demanded a kit-bag inspection.
This did not reveal the money, but it disclosed five
separate cases of soldier stealing from soldier.
TOO MUCH NOISE.
T. ATKINS: “Blast them shells! A feller
can't ’ear ’iniself eat his soup.”
“Comrade”: Damper-makers and those
interested can follow this advice and save ink and
further argument, to say nothing of flour. Have the
ashes red-hot. Mix flour with lukewarm water.
Knead very little. Scrape a hole in ashes. Put
damper in. Cover with a thin layer of ashes till
damper rises, then cover completely. Cook for half
an hour. Give a smart tap with a. stick occa-
sionally if no timepiece is handy—a hollow sound is
the best sign to go by. The result of this method is
no flukes or failures, all certs, and satisfaction in
the camp.
OUR MUTUAL FRIEND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You meet him everywhere you go ;
He seems to wander to and fro
As if Life held for him but one intention—
That is, to stop you as you pass,
And say, “Well, what about a glass?”
And absolutely offer no attention
To any plea you have to make;
His mission ’tis a thirst to slake;
It doesn’t matter where or when or whither,
He simply steers you to the bar,
And orders beer or triple star.
And wastes your time by talking ail the blither
That he has heard throughout che day,
Until you tear yourself away.
His heart's all right, hut he gives me “the needle.”
lie meets you round the corner, and
He clasps you warmly by the hand,
Anil, Holy Relies, how that chap will wheedle.
He chloroforms you on the spot,
And swears you’ve yot to have a “tot,”
Although you swear you’re frantically busy.
“Now, one won’t take a jiff,” he pleads,
And firmly to the fountain leads
Tlie pal who really wishes him to blazes.
“Good luck!” he says, and, then, “So-long!”
There isn’t in him any wrong—
His is the great Australian heart whose craze is
To make you feel he is your friend —
You bet he is, too, to the end —-
But sometimes I get fed up with his greeting
“Well, what about a drink, old horse?
Oh, you can keep one down, of course” —
The same old gag at every time of meeting;
Or, “Fill ’em up again, old man—•
You having whisky? Mine's a can.”
It. doesn’t matter what you think about it.
You’re going to have a “spot” with him—
That is his everlasting whim-
It's up to him, and he is going to shout it.
And when this earthly life is o'er
i'll meet him on the Golden Shore—
For he'll he there that gloom-dispelling drifter—
He'll grab me by the wing and say:
“How are you, Bill? This is O.K. !
Gome on in here and let us have a ‘snifter’!”

lias afforded me ready relief when, as is frequently
the case, I have been suffering from Sore Throat.”
Lord Kingsale writes: “ I and my family
use quite a number of Wulfing’s Formamint
Tablets and find them all you say they are.
I always carry a goodly number in my pocket,
and have recommended them to many friends.”

There was an awful splash in tlie soup
tureen in Auckland the other day. The
city has tlie Saturday lialf-holiday; but a
few dissatisfied rag merchants wanted to
revert to Wednesday. To secure a poll on
the question they had to get a petition
signed by about 10.000 residents and hand it
to the City Council. Canvassers were em-
ployed to do the collecting; but instead of
paying them a fixed wage Fluff decided to
give no premium for loafing and made it
piece-work—l2s. Gd. for each 100 signa--
tures. Fluff was delighted with the response ;
the public was so much in favor of the
Wednesday'holiday that some of the can-
vassers got 400 signatures in a day. What
everybody seemed to forget was that the
town clerk would check the signatures on
the petition, to see if the persons supposed
to have signed were on tlie roll. Very soon
afterwards things began to happen; and
when the town clerk sniffed violently at
nearly GOO j signatures the tremendous peti-
tion of Private Enterprise was heaved into
tlie aslibin.
*- ’ * * *
From a man in the trade:—
The timber, which would cost 3s. 6d. to pass the
Australian Customs if it were Oregon from America
or kauri from Maoriland costs only Is. if it is < fiber
rimu or white pine from Maoriland. This differentia-
tion is quite absurd. Indeed, there is more reason, to
favor Oregon ’and kauri than white pine and rimu.
Much as 1 would like to find an Australian substi-
tute, I know- none that could take the place of
Oregon; and .the rapidly-disappearing- kauri has its
special and exclusive qualities. The whole explana-
tion of tlie preference, given to white pine is that it
was at one time believed to he the only timber suit-
able for butter boxes. Queensland and the Richmond
River district of X. S. Wales have, however, exploded
this idea, the. former having used hoop pine for some
years, while the Richmond River district has taken
up the “colonial” pine. These two timbers are prac-
tically identical, any difference being accounted for
by climatic conditions, etc. Both are proving to be
quite as good as white pine. Under any circum-
stances, the quantity of white pine employed to make
butter boxes is but a moderate fraction of the total,
the balance being used for linings, shelvings, cabinet
work, etc. The other timber, rimu, has no earthly
right to receive preferential treatment. At least, 1
have never been able to hear of any reason for it.
With the local trade both in hardwood and pine in
its present languishing' condition, mills and gear idle
and teams and men with nothing to do, it is surely
not too much to ask that these two timbers should
be brought under the ordinary schedule. Even then
the Maoriland getters will not be unduly handicapped,
inasmuch as they have water carriage and thick bush
(which mean small costs), while in Australia our
timber trees are very scattered, and in most cases the
logs must now be hauled at least 20 miles.

“Y.Z.”: How is this? The two parties to
the yarn are in different departments of art
in a Victorian metropolis (it doesn’t do to
be too definite). ..Brush met Penn in the
street a few days ago. and after prelimin-
aries and an invitation to beer, Brush spake
thus: “Could you lend me a fiver, old man?
I’m in a bit of a hole just now, but will be
in a position to pay back in a week or two.”
The fiver was forthcoming, and Brush con-
tinued his assurances: “I sometimes have
to borrow, but I always pay. and you can
rest easy about this.” As they were part-
ing Penn said: “By the way, old man, I’m
being married on Tuesday week —you might
come along.” “Tuesday week?” said Brush.
“Sorry I can’t. You see, I am having a
meeting of my creditors on Tuesday week!”
“P.IVC*: The most startling business
notice"! ever saw was in Brisbane. It was
above the door of a baker’s shop and read :
FAMILY’S OWN VITALS COOKED
HERE DAILY.
Thinking over it, I am certain that baker
was a German.
* * * «.
Margarine is being sold freely %i tlie vast
cow-milking districts of Maoriland. If
anyone bad a year ago suggested that such
a thing could happen lie would have been
banded the address of the nearest asylum.
But John Bull’s hunger for cheese has
caused M.L.. their atten-
tion to p ; ifl(iq:g~'teai Glwgldiir. and pushed
sky high tlie price of the infrequent pound of
butter.
“ITamer” The lay-by system, which is
an extension of tlie time-payment habit, is
now an institution in many big stores and
a few small ones. Tlie customer, seeing
something she desires —it is nearly always
a woman who d6es this sort of thing—pays
a deposit and lias her fancy “laid-by” until
she has made up the amount required to
purchase it. In many cases she changes
her mind, or is unable to make up the
amount, or forgets about it; and although,
usually, the firms are prepared to give other
goods for tlie money paid-, provided the cus-
tomer hasn’t dawdled too long, there are
many people who don’t understand that.
In fact, recently a woman went to a Sydney
police station for 1 advice over one trans-
action. She stated she had made an arrange-
ment with a shop to lay-by a cloak, and
had handed in several instalments ; but: she
was unable to keep up her payments, and
was horribly afraid Softgoods and Co. might
sue her for the balance outstanding on the
goods she had never had.
Most of the rural police stations in
N. S. Wales have fallen into such decay
that the- force is in danger of being
smothered in a general collapse. Of course
they were built with loan. More loan is
now to be spent on pulling them down, and
further loan on putting up new buildings.
And still there are some people who babble
of “permanent and reproductive” works and
deride a sinking fund —as even Andrew
Fisher did the other day.
N.S.W. Attorney-General Hall has been
explaining how the farmer is taken down
by speculators “who never own .a bag of
wheat,” but gamble on market quotations.
Hall says the farmer’s losses through this
are enormous, though he doesn’t go into
figures. Between P. Enterprise bulling tlie
market to-day and bearing prices to-morrow,
and a Government which collars the wheat
and forcibly prevents the owner selling at
the higher price he could get elsewhere, it
looks as if cocky ought to know more now
about the frying-p«n and tlie fire than ever.
The Socialist and I.WAY. parties in
Sydney have held a mass meeting and
passed a resolution ordering the war to stop.
If these people want the war to stop the
best thing they can do is to get a gun and
use it. To pass peaceful resolutions while
there is a Ivaiser running loose is like
throwing rose leaves to restrain a wild boar.
From London :
Kitchener afid Fisher have both an objection to
appearing in the House of Lords, and tlie House
resents their absence bitterly. The blue-bloods who
come there to lounge imagine that they are fighting
the Germans; but Kitchener and Fisher are under
no such illusions, and when the War Lord steps into
the gilded chamber he does so merely to formally
read a message which has been typed for the press,
and doesn’t even worry about speaking; plainly enough
to be heard.
“Melb’s” send-off: —
Died last week, aged 88. ex-Superintendent Pew-
tress. In 1852 lie was imported, with 49 other
London policemen. Something revolutionary pres-
ently occurred. Chief Commissioner Standish • and
Superintendent Winch submitted to Premier Berry
a plan for training cadets as officers. Nearly all
the officers were then “gentlemen” of the cadet
stamp. Berry upset the pot; hut it is safe to say
that if McCulloch had been in power the system
would have gone on. Berry, instead, appointed
four sergeants as inspectors—-Lamer, of Ballarat;
Drought, of Bendigo; Toohey, of .Geelong; and
Archibald, of Warrnambool, tlie last the father of
J.F.A. Afterwards Babington and Pewtress were
added. Standish was nettled, and tried to put square
men in round holes to irritate the public. Thus
Pewtress, who had little or no knowledge of horse-
flesh, was placed in charge of Benalla district, where
tlie progeny of “Red Kelly” were beginning to he
troublesome in horse-stealing. Toohey, a splendid
. -horseman, was stuck as Prosecutor in the Melbourne
.'City Court, so that his educational deficiencies might
? he noticeable. With a similar idea Lamer and
Drought were brought forward in the same court.
Yet the sergeants proved: themselves up to anything,
even if thev were not all strict grammarians. 1 ooi
Pewtress was the only .one from whom Standish*
malice obtained any satisfaction. \Unle this city
man ruled at Benalla, the Kellys murdered bcanlan,
Lonergan and Kennedy. ..Yet he soon rose wonder-
fullv to the work of scouring the territory, and what
baffled him also long baffled Standish, Hare and
Xicholson when they went to the Benalla distnct.
Pewtress served under Mitchell, McMahon, Standish,
Xicholson and Chomley, fe Commissioners. His Ut>
Court beaks—2o years he was in charge there
included Sturt, Panton, Call and Hackett.
The Argus is inviting bouquets for its
right-thinking attitude on the subject of
sport in war time. In a recent issue it
published a letter of effusive thanks lor its
“spirited comments” on “the deplorable in-
difference shown by footballers to recruiting
for the Front.” Tlie! correspondent hoped
that “you will continue to ‘pound’ away
until such time as public opinion is roused
up. to bring them to a sense oi shame. And
to show its deadly earnestness tae Akops.
in the same issue, gave four and a halt
columns of nonpareil to football reports.
Its policy in this matter is much the same
as when it publishes-leaders bewailing Aus-
tralia’s lack of population and accepts
advertisements of jobs open only to those
“without encumbrances.”
“Motorbus” from the Panama bazaar:—
I went to see the opening of the Australian
Pavilion at the World’s - Fair. Deakin mentioned
“God’s own country” in flattering terms; then began
on the virtues of the best-fed present. He took them
collectively and individually, and when he was through
I dumblv apologised for my presence among the great
ones of the earth. When'Alfred sat down ihe great
ones rose, one at a time, and proceeded to hand out
to him exactly the same mellifluous stuff he had
thrown at them. From the speeches I gathered that
this was Alfred the Great, that America admired
him, that the wliole world admired him, and that he
represented a people tlie.j like -of which the Dollai
Country might never meet again. At this stage i
replaced my hat and glared defiance on all present.
Anon a ’Murkan official approached, and, remarking
that he wished to present Mrs. Deakin with a memento
of “this historic occasion,” placed in her hands a
small case containing a . medallion. The lady rose
majestically and announced in thrilling tones: “Aus-
tralia thanks you!” I burst into tears and went
borne. "
From New York Tribune’s war scribe
with the German forces :
One day, as the Kaiser was motoring along a
chaussee, he met a herd of swine under the guardian-
ship of a bearded Landskurm man, who drove them
rapidly to one side to keep them from being pre-
maturely slaughtered by the Imperial auto. As the
motor slowed up the Kaiser asked him if he was a
farmer by profession. “No ; professor of the Lmver-
sity of Tubingen,” came the answer.
Getting to the hog stage by degrees, as it
were. y-" ;
Rosina Buekman was lately appearing in
her old part of Susuki in “Madame Butter-
fly” at the Shaftesbury (London). If
Courtneidge sees a fair opening for Aus-
tralian talent in a musical show he puts
Australian talent there.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The newspapers have credited to Admiral von
Tirpitz tlie remark that Germany is not acting with-
out “sublime"judgment” in retaining her navy. “We
shall utilise our ships of war,” says Tirpitz, “in a
manner that will astonish our enemies.”
The ships are hid in secret ways
By inurd’rous mines defended ;
They’re seeking not the honored hays
For which the brave contended,
But hays where they
May lodge a fray
In which their glory and their day
Might suddenly be ended.
Xew use for ships the Kaiser learns,
Though it may serve to rot ’em;
Not for vainglory ’tis he yearns
To keep them now lie’s got ’em.

His folks in need
With myriad barnacles that breed
Upon each vessel’s bottom !

Above all things never neglect a sore throat for it may mean years of suffering in after life. You may
not look upon it seriously, but a sore throat indicates weakness in the bronchial tubes. If neglected it will
soon develop into some chronic complaint. People who are troubled this way are most susceptible to
influenza, contract pneumonia and bronchial troubles readily, and fall easy victims to consumption.
To quickly remove this irritation, soothe and heal the inflamed tubes, there is nothing equal to

TH E best and latest developments
in automobile design, construc-
tion and equipment are supplied
in the Overland.
The body is modelled on beautiful
stream lines, without a break. The
tonneau is large. The springs are
long and unusually flexible. The
fenders are crowned. ' >
The Overland has the most ad-
vanced electrjf: lighting and starting
system of the two-unit type. Each
unit is more efficient than is a single
unit performing two duties. Ignition
is oy aign -tension magneto without
batteries, independent of starting and
lighting.
The instruments are most con-
veniently placed in the cowl dash.
The appointments are complete and
of high quality. The Overland is built
in the Willys-Overland factory—the
largest motor-car plant in the world.
Thus we know that every part is made
as perfectly as finest materials, most
expert workmanship and most efficient
machinery can make it.
Intending car purchasers are urged
to see the highly-developed Overland
at the local show-rooms.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Melbourne Argus lately used up a column
trying to find a reason for the alleged 300
per cent, duty on “sporting jackets” and
the 162 per cent, on “cheap skirts.” Heaven
knoAVS where these figures came from, the
duty on apparel, other than certain speci-
fied lines, being 45 per cent. f *but ridiculous
as its rates are, the Argus conclusions are
worse. It found that: —-
(1) The duty is so high that the goods are left in
bond. „ „ .
(2) There will, therefore, he a falling oft in
revenue.
(3) There will be no increased local production
because (a) of the scarcity of skilled labor; and
(b) of the impossibility at present of importing raw
material.
It left the problem at that as unsolvable.
Yet the unsolvable problem is easily
solved: —•
(1) If the goods stay in bond till Doomsday they
are all the time paying storage charges, and they
stay out of consumption, and so don’t compete with
the local article. , .
(2) Though the Customs revenue is lost, it is
more than compensated for by extra, production at
home and extra direct taxation.
(3) If there really is a scarcity of skilled labor
it will pay Australia better to import the labor than
the products of labor; and _if it is impossible to
import the raw material, it is equally impossible to
import the finished article.
“FIE, SIR, FIE!"
From Hansard (30/4/’l5) :
Poynton, M.P.: Some little time ago I directed the
Prime Minister’s attention to the fact that a secre-
tary of the Young Turks’ Association was employed
in the Censor's office.
That may help to explain a. lot of things
that called for a lot of explaining.
A cable message the other day chronicled
a remark by N’York Tribune that “the na-
tion which remembered the Maine would not
forget the Lusitania.” The message, Avhich
no doubt refers to the proposal to exact
financial reparation from Germany, had evi-
dently been mangled. For “Maine” read
“Main Chance.”
Hagelthorn, Vic. Minister of Works, is
being furiously cursed by a whole herd of
Bumbles. He recently fell on a lot of one-
horse, one-pub municipalities,-and said that
in cases Avhere the revenue last year was
under £l5OO in shires and £3OO in boroughs,
there must be amalgamation with adjoin-
ing areas. Of course this means that many
local grocers will have to shed their rabbit-
skin cloaks and cocked hats, and bitter is
the Availing thereat. Some of the doomed
councils could have saved themselves from
extinction had they insisted on a fair valua-
tion of property in the municipalities; but
that would mean parting up, and they
would rather lose their dignity than their
money. Ilagelthorn’s firmness in dealing
with these tinpot councils puts an entry to
the Government’s credit.
G. S. Beeby, who is billed to contest
the late Colonel Braund’s Assembly seat
for Armidale (N.S.W.), has many of both
the qualities and the defects of B. R. Wise.
Both have pleasant manners and neither
inspires great confidence. Beeby has a pro-
found knowledge of industrial matters: so
has Wise. Beeby, like Wise, has been
marked down for years as a man with a
future. In both cases the future has per-
sistently stayed in front. Beeby threw away
bright political prospects for a principle;
so did Wise.- Tf- Wise had remained con-
sistently Tory he could have done nearly as
well for himself as Beeby by hanging
on to Labor after he was- convin'ceßt* that
Labor had thrown over its early principles.
On his brains and youthful promise Wise
; slioqld : .never:;' liaAte .been an Agefit-General
"'in‘ the' evening''bihi'A caremv And Beeby,
who has enough capacity to make a sound
Premier, is, in the same Way, unlikely, un-
less politics change for the better, com-
pletely, to eA r er be more than an occasional
disturbance.
IN THE FUTURE.
The Chief Secretary (Mr. Styles) received to-day a
deputation, which presented a strong case in support
of a request that women police should be appointed
to assist the metropolitan force. —Adelaide paper.
“ Come on blokes! It's all right: Bills got the
copper occupied."
Hugh Mahon, the not always good-
tempered Federal Minister for External
Affairs, appears to have managed the repre-
sentation of Australia at the ’Frisco Exhi-
bition with a branch of prickly pear. First
there was the comic rumpus with Deakin
before he left, his resignation and the subse-
quent Ministerial mutterings and growlings.
Noav Mahon has stirred up more trouble,
and Deakin and Nielsen have flung unaf-
fable cablegrams at him stating that they
have turned their jobs down. A fearful
rumor spread round Sydney that Nielsen
was abandoning the four guineas a day
and exes, he gets from N. S. Wales for
inhabiting California; but happily the
whole world isn’t as mad as all that yet.
“The Convivial Wowser”: The Sabbath
and George Black, N.S.W. Minister, are
still at loggerheads, and the day of gloom
which some people so fervently desire is
not likely to happen to any extent when
the new legislation goes through. After
all, the Sabbath gloom, though common to
some of the children of Shem, was never
much of a European institution. Neither
Roman nor. Greek churches had any use
for it in its aggravated form. England
didn’t know it until the seventeenth century.
John Knox in Scotland was for a free Sun-
day, and the Scotchbyterians, though they
professed to set such store by the sterner
observance of the day, only borrowed their
notion from the English Puritans after the
Westminster Assembly had put its seal upon
it George Black isn’t attacking an ancient
Christian institution, but merely modifying
a modern innovation of the Calvinistic
school of religious thought.
The Holman Government’s solution of
the rent problem, having shown signs of
springing a leak, is to be patched up and its
name is to be altered from Ragtown to Tin-
ville. The change to corrugated iron is to
be made gradually; but it is confidently
expected that all the residents will be made
nice and warm by next summer.
“Don Q.”: Thanks to Freetrade, the
British hosiery trade had been almost anni-
hilated by Germany prior to the Avar. V hen
the war broke out, mv firm,
Avhich is in a big way of
business, acted upon the
cabled advice of its London
buyer, and bought all the
German-made cotton hosiery
and underwear it could lay
hands on in Australia. There
Avas no trouble in selling that
lot. Britisli-made cotton
hosiery and underwear is now
beginning to dribble into the
Commonwealth ; but the sup-
ply isn’t at all equal to the
demand, and if the war
ended to-morrow the Saxon
hosiery makers would in a
feAV months again have the
run of the earth unless Aus-
tralia and the rest of the
British dominions set up a
barrier against the goods.
The argument used against
duties, that Australia doesn’t
produce the raw material, is rotten. Ger-
many doesn’t produce the raw material for
this industry either.
Significant words from a young Australian
officer, writing on Good Friday from one of
the Gjeek islands opposite the Daj'jh’nelles-:

He was. about the first to be killed when the
Day came and the name was made.
“Copy Boy” : I have just been robbed of Gd.
Noticing in the Vic. press that the time was
ripe for those wishing to get on the roll of
Leg. Council voters to make appli-
lication, I decided to be enrolled —
a right I possess by reason of vast
educational attainments. Feeling
like a man Avith a stake in the
country, I Avent to obtain my elec-
toral right, and having convinced
a conscientious civil servant that I
really and truly had matriculated,
the document was handed to me,
along with a request for sixpence.
On demanding an explanation I
was told that, although those
Avith a propputy qualification are
placed on the roll automatically,
others, who are merely entitled to
a vote through happening to be
medical practitioners, certificated
teachers, matriculated students of
Melb. ’Varsity, graduates of any
British University or officers of the
sea or land forces, not only
have to apply for an elector’s right, but are
charged sixpence for it.
The United States’ official attitude has
improved during the week ; nevertheless the
Note to Germany, suggesting that the latter
should explain that the sinking of the Lusi-
tania “was not officially authorised,” and
was due to “a mistake on the. part of the
German commander,” is farcical. Three
months ago Germany announced its inten-
tion of sinking this ship. The U.S. smiled ;
but the giant liner took the threat seriously
enough to fly, on at- least one trip, the Stars
and Stripes in place - of the Union Jack.
This made the whole world smile. It was
like a mastodon trying to disguise itself as
a rabbit.
A campaign has already started in Adel-
aide to modify the Close-all-bars-at-six
decision of a recent referendum. Lewis
Cohen, seven times Mayor of Adelaide,
after explaining that he has no in-
terest in the liquor trade and has
personally been an abstainer for sev-
eral years, moved in the City Council
that the closing will be “prejudicial to the
best interests of the ratepayers and detri-
mental to the trade and commerce of the
city and the State.” Cohen’s main points
Avere: (1) Adelaide’s admittedly good lead-
ing hotels will have to cut down expenses,
and profitable tourists will be driven else-
AA'here; (2) incidentally, it Avill cost £9OO
a year to replace the brilliant lighting uoav
supplied outside the bars; (3) tram and
train revenues must fall, as a pub-less city
Avill not attract in the evenings; (4) South
Aus. as a State has affirmed local-option,
and has already closed one-third of the
hotels in some districts, on a local vote.
At the Referendum, Adelaide . City voted
two to one for eleven o’clock. Why, then,
should it throw local option over and suffer
from the fads of other districts? ■ The City
Council, arguing on those lines, could rake
up only one vote to cast against Cohen’s
motion.
Jabez Wright, the rouglFdiamond "MT.L.A.
for some of the Broken Hill miners, has
been in Queensland giving the Labor men a
lift —and, as usual, putting his hand in Ins
own pocket to pay the exes. _Up Mount
Morgan way an audience got interested in
N. S. Wales politics, and somebody asked
Avhy the Labor party had appointed J. D.
Fitzgerald to run things in the Leg. Coun-
cil. “You couldn’t get a better man for
that particular' job',” - said Jabez. “Why,
the family’s been running circuses all its
life.” . - -
THE LAST RESORT.
“Hey, hold on, till I get someone to prop it up!"
Through its neutral friends, Germany has
been busy knocking the bottom out of the
Allies’ story that food is getting scarce at
Berlin. BTit the 'Hun only flounders deeper
into degradation; for the more food he has
are his attacks on un L
''ai’lneil British vessels; since it was only by
talking of “starvation” in, the first placle
that>he scmgftt' 16 W^tifr his piracy.
The death of Arthur Anderson, who held
the Bass seat, has pushed the Tasmanian
Ministry still further into its awkward
corner. When the present Parliament met
after the general election in 1913 the Lib-
erals had a majority of two, but death and
misadventure caused them to lose this
advantage, and when Whitsitt refused to
follow Solomon any further, out the liberals
went. During last session Whitsitt held the
balance and made everyone uncomfortable.
If the Liberals can discover a strong candi-
date for Bass, Labor will have to struggle
hard to score a win, as the sectarian spectre
is stalking through the land, and is perhaps
more likely to injure Labor than the other
party.
ANOTHER WAR TROUBLE.
“What are you looking so infernally glum
about, old boy ?”
“Glum! Now else could a chap look after he'd
been made a presentation of a sov reign case,
and the bally bank wont give him gold to
put in it ?”
THE LANDING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Under the pall of drifting smoke
In the dark of the dawn they came,
And the hidden death on their thin ranks broke,
And the great guns talked in flame.
The strip of sand, and the cliffs’ high-face,
And the hard, grim work to do—
But the pride of Australia set the pace,
And they saw the tough job through.
Up where the bullets hissed aqd fell,
And the splintering shells burst wide,
The dawn on the Asian hills could tell
How gamely they fought and died,
How the Turk at their summons yielded ground
And flinched from the bayonet’s threat,
And a young, new nation’s soul was found
Where the ranks of death were set.
We have read it all. And the names come through—
Our record of loss and paih;
The lads we cheered and the men we knew
That Ave shall-not see again ;
But a pride is ours that our land can rear
A warrior breed like these,
AY ho stood to their task with a scorn of fear
}' On the ridge of the Chersonese.
jSomewhere our chief of foes may read
j: Of the thingjmy ' -
iOf the men untried and their soldier deed
In their first red battle fought;
And he, the lord of the war machine
Made perfect in every part,
May wonder to find a shaft so keen
New aimed at his nation’s heart.
But we who know that his doom shall fall
As the faithful months march on,
Have another dream, for we hear the call
To Australia's Marathon.
And we see afar through the smoke and flame
Of a day that is yet to be —
The mighty strife with its blood-bought fame
That shall keep Australia free.

SPORTIG
NOTIONS
When mails to hand left London a fuss
was brewing over the location and date of the next
Olympic Games. Germany had the chilled-steel
nerve to demand that they should take place at Ber-
lin in 1916, as arranged before the Allies started to
clean up the European sties, and that only athletes
of Hogland, her allies and neutral countries should
be permitted to compete. This demand was the re-
sult of the action of Baron de Pierre Combertou,
president of the International Olympic Committee, in
deciding to organise the next Games himself. Uncle
Sam is _ to run the show —at least, he is to nominate
which of his cities he would like to be the scene of
the tests. The programme decided upon last year will
be put through, the Count says, but no records will
be taken. The British and French authorities were utter-
ing whoops of disrespect concerning the scheme, and
the French committee, in a formal protest, was urging
that when the time came for the Games, Belgium
should have the staging (at Antwerp), or, failing
Belgium, Switzerland.
The only Bill Beach is to have one more
spin with the oars, lie and Peter Kemp are to race
oVer three-quarters of a mile, on Sydney’s Belgian
Regatta Day. The reception they will get will crack
(he ribs of the welkin.

- Of the 22 young athletes who have rowed
for Geelong Grammar School in the Victorian Public
Schools’ annual eight-oar race since 1910, all but
four are either already rastling with the Turk or

worth winning even than the position of “head of
the river” half a dozen times in succession.

The champion motor-boat of Maoriland,
Fleetwing, had to defend her title at Auckland the
other day, when the Disturber, of Christchurch,
appeared in pursuit of the championship. The rules
called for three races over a three-and-a-half-knot
course. The first race, run in perfect weather with
smooth water, was a ding-dong go, Fleetwing just
getting home with 35see. to spare. Then a clumsy
pleasure craft rammed the Disturber, and she had to
flee to the nearest slip, which she reached in a sink-
ing condition. She was patched up, but the mishap
had damaged her constitution, for two days later she
lost the second race, and with it all hope of taking
the championship south.

Like other - athletic bodies N. S. Wales
Rugby League lias been drained of a lot of its
strength by the call of the nation. The secretary
officially estimates that fullv lOOff nlavers from the
various grades hgve taken the soldier’s oath. There
are 39 fewer A jgrade clubs* this season than there
were last, which ,is significant, it is true there are
29 additional B and <3 grade clubs,, hut the League’s
age and weight rules are such that disbanded A grade
clubs cannot have been merged into their ranks. This
oufflit to cheek some of the hot words that were
thrown at League tdeballers for not -going to the
Front by fierce patriots who daily blow off in the
newspapers as “Pfou'd oi' the Empire,” “Union Jack.”'

Somewhere about 25,000 people paid their

at the tail end - of the game, a great struggle was wit-
nessed between South Sydney and Newtown. With
the score 8 to 7 in favor-of S.S. just on the call of>
time, Newtown’s brightest goal-kicker was given a
chance from a penalty. South Sydney’s army of
barrackers sucked in a long breath and laid back its
ears. Biff! No goal! The ensuing yells of victory
and howls of disappointment shook the Stands on
their foundations. Other games: Glebe, 17: Annan-

Despite last Saturday’s sodden weather at
Melbourne there were fair attendances at the foot-
ball contests, which provided some surprises. . The
collision of ’Roy and Saints promised most hut
provided least, the Maroons early grasping the fact
that dribbling the ball along the sloppy turf was
the surest way to make a do of things. On the other
hand, or rather foot, their lamentable goal-kicking
merited disaster. The Saints relied on their old
policy of high-marking and long kicking, but as the
ball was like a well-oiled bladder of lard it didn’t
pay. Scores : ’Roy, 5 goals 19 behinds; St. Kilda,
2 goals 6 behinds. Few but bigoted barrackers faced
the soaking showers on the bleak Carlton Oval to
see the locals demolish Essendon. Playing a close
same, ’Dons worked the ball well up and then booted
for goal, scoring 8 out of 16 likely shots, while the
Old Blues got but three from an equal number of
tries—s 6 to 31. This was ’Don’s first win this season,
and was due to good generalship chiefly. The un-
defeated Magpies held Melbourne safely throughout,,
and _ notched 67 points to latter’s 39, their game
consisting mainly of concerted, well-supported rushes,'
with more hand- than foot-ball. Richmond visited
Geelong, and woke un the inhabitants by collecting
7,1 points to the local’s 34. Geelong remarked that
it must have been an accident, and fell asleep again.
Ass. games furnished several shocks, with exempli-
fication of the fact that only cheerful idiots try
to kick goals from far out on a windy day with a
slippery hall. P’ran realised* this, when the scorer
closed his book with the locals owning three goals
18 behinds to Brunswick’s five goals 10 behinds. The
other teams put in some .swift and accurate work,
North outing ’Scray with 66 points to 46, and Port
walloping: Essendon with 76 to 57 ; while teams from
the twq extreme suburbs, ’Cote and Brighton,
struggled vigorously all the moist afternoon for no
tangible result, a tally of 11 goals 10 behinds apiece
being the record.
The war-;/ lus-foo tball squabble between
Vie. and S.A. Leagues still drags on, as most squab-
bles do when conducted by letter, each side feeling
bound to answer the last thing received with a reply
still more dignified and crushing. Vie. has moved
last, by declining to discuss the Adelaide letter of
April 27 “until such letter is withdrawn, and the
South Aus. Football League sees fit to address itself
to this body in a more courteous and becoming
manner.” S.A. to move next.
At the beginning of last football season
the Bendigo League bunged out California Gully
Club because its ground was not close enough to
town to draw a payable gate. So last season’s senior
football was confined to Bendigo City, South Bendigo
and Eaglehawk Clubs. This meant that there was
only one match a week, and, consequently, only one
gate. All of which set the League thinking. As a
result of tlie think, Castlemaine was offered the
vacant place in the Association, but it sniffed and
turned the bait down. Then Rochester, 30 miles
away, was induced to come in to make a fourth.
The Bendigo ’bailers thought that the team would
be a joke, but when the cockies blew out the miners
of Eaglehawk a different and unholy aspect came o’er
the spirit of their dreams. The excuse made was
that the win was a fluke and that Rochester would go
down with a mighty smash on the next Saturday.
AVherefore South Bendigo took a big crowd up to
Rochester to see South eat the cockies raw. But at
the end of the day’s play South was down and out.
The following week Rochester went to Bendigo and
gave the only remaining team in the League the
father of a licking. Which seems to show that the
prophet with the whiskers 6ft. long who recorded that
all was vanity was more or less correct.'
KELLY MAITLAND , veteran handicapper
to the V.A.T.C. , lately resigned.
A. McDonald, the last of the famous All
Blacks to linger, on the muddied field, has finally
retired at « Dunedin (M.L.). He started as
a forward for Kaikorai, one of the most
famous clubs of Dunedin, and in 1904 plaved his
first rep. game for Otago against Southland. The
following year he was chosen to gq* to logland, and
throughout that tour he was one oSkb.e,, mainstays of
the forward division. In the season in Loan-
Land he really reached the zenith flof bis form, and
ho played wonderfully during: thefifei'ee following
seasons. In- 1913 he captained the sSI.L. team that
had such a picnic tour in Califoi’pft-. w Last season
he led Kaikorai to victory in tire lAmcdhi first-grade!
championship,, a position it had not attained for 13
years. Then he reckoned he had done the fair thing,
lie wore the sombre black of Maoriland in over 50
’ engagements, and pla.yejL-for Otago about the same
number of times.

N.S.W. Rugby League has used the dis-
qualification axe early this season. Last week nine
players were presented with stand-down credentials,
and it is expected that this unusual sign of firmness
will damp down some of the berserks who make
football as dangei'ous and unpopular as running down
mad bulls. These warnings should be given early in
the season. If they are not, a crop of feuds is sown
that produces a very black harvest as the competi-
tions progress and opportunities offer to “get a bit
back.” * •

Major Blair Swannell, who fell in the
Australians’ first rush upon the Turk, was always
early at the seat of trouble. He was a lieutenant of
the Imperial Yeomanry in the Boer war, Maxim-gun
corporal in the Jamieson raid, and unpaid major on
the side of the insurgents during a siege of Monte
Video. After the insurgents were bought off he
cleared out on an oil steamer, as there were 600dols.
on the head of all foreign leaders. He reckoned he
had the hardest face on earth. Once the British and
Queensland teams were being entertained at dinner
by the N.S.AV. Union. After the speeehmaking the
late P. K. Lane jocularly said: “AVe’ll now have a
competition for the ugliest man playing football,”
and offered himself for N. S. AA r ales. M. Dore nomi-
nated himself for Queensland. Then Swannell rose
solemnly and said: “I represent England.” “They
had forgotten me,” said Swannell, and there wasn’t
anv argument.

The' V.R.C. has decided not to cut its
prize-monev down for 1915-16 ; but in 1917 the Sires
Produce Stakes will show a reduction of £250. The
next Melbourne Cup will, therefore, carry £BOOO.
Providence smiled on the Adelaide Cup
meeting, giving beautiful weather for the firit and
most important two days, after which the best rains
for quite a year descended and made everyone cheer-
ful though damp. The Cup, like the Goodwood,
went to a Melbourne horse owned by an old South
Australian. It was Fred Burn’s Naxbery this time,
bought by the old steeplechase-rider when he started
as trainer. The colt was made favorite in spite of
his Australian Cup failure, and gave Juan Fernandez
nearly 2st. and a clear length beating. Dividend
only £2 14s. On the first day Naxbery had won
the only weight-for-age race of the meeting, very
easily, from Devron and Jolly Beggar. S.A. Stakes
(2-year-old) was the good thing it looked for E. E.
1). Clarke's Lesbos; but the local Leger was a
horrible boil-over, Hickenbotham’s Fidelio, heavily
backed in a field of only three, losing, by a head, to
something called Nomion. In a hurdle race on the
same day there was a useful dividend of £46 145.,
and a bit left over for backers of the second.
* * * *
Newcastle (N.S.W.) Cup, on Saturday,
was a boil-over for The Bag, the placed horses being
Duke Alwyne, 7st. (16 to one) ; Firm, 9st. (14 to
one) ; and Blueberry, 7st. 51b. (25 to one). The
embellishment of a Tatt.’s sweep swelled a mere
suburban handicap field to 33 starters, six better
than last year. As a result of the Duke’s win at
AVallsend last mid-week, the local miners supported
him to carry them to hope and glory ; and they were
not disappointed. Two features about the Cup were
that the three placed horses this year finished un-
placed last year. Duke Alwyne was bred in N.S.W.
by Moses Bros., and is by St, Alwyne (imp.) from
Countess Aberdeen (imp.)—a mixture of foreign blue
blood.
Another ringing-in case has just resulted
in one John Jordan being disqualified for life. The
'horse concerned was entered at Ascot (Vic.) as Hardy
■ French. The astonishing character of- his perform-
ance caused the local stewards to make inquiries.
They found Hardy French to be Zoeller, a N.S.W.-
bred horse that lias won 24 races in Queensland. The
queer thing is that the ringer-in never gets more
than disqualification.

Ally Sloper’s win of the Grand National

Eugene Corri, the world’s most renowned
referee, who has been giving Pearson's Weekly
some reminiscences, says he has been the man with
the say-so in about 1000 fights in 30 years. Of Bom-
bardier Wells he relates that Australia’s Hugh D.
Mclntosh, when he (Me.) went to London, was the
first to pay Wells three figures. Previous to that
about the most he had received for a fight was a
tenner. Yet he was being boomed as the man who
could beat Jack Johnson!

In the recent fight at London between
Wells and Moran, Charlie Mitchell, England’s one-
time champion with knuckles or gloves, was in the
latter’s corner. Mitchell was beaten with the gloves
by Jim Corbett (at present in Australia) in 189'4 in
three rounds. AVith bare - hands he was. a wonder,
and John L. Sullivan had all the helping of them
he required when he agreed to make his ‘ fight with
Mitchell a draw after three hours of slugging in
Chantilly, France, on March 10, 1888.

Boxing in Adelaide is being re-established

knocked out Bill AVestly (S.A.) ; Second, Duggan
(Vic.) outpointed “Red” after a fine contest not far
removed from top-rung class. Both these boys will
make good with the best of them directly. On Cup
night Frank O’Grady (Vic.) gave H. Hutton a bad
time over 20 rounds, and Frank should have a fair
chance against Hughie Mehegan in the same ring on

Jack Clune, billed as a Coming Champion
in the lightweight class, had a bit of bad luck in
striking Herb McCoy at Sydney Stadium on Saturday
night, when the latter was at the top of his form.
McCoy’s condition was perfect, and be was as strong
as a bull. He set out from the jump to overwhelm
the newcomer by sheer ruggedness and punch. For
half a dozen rounds Clune made the Champion re-
semble an amateur. Then he started slowly to peter
out. He was still winning on points, but his her-
culean little adversary continued to move flat-
footedly round with the minimum of effort, taking
his hooks and uppercuts as though they had been
fly-whisks, and every now and then slamming in
wicked body blows. The body blows did a lot of
damage, but the master punch of the evening was a
left cross delivered with McCoy’s head. It laid
Clune's right eyebrow open for an inch or more, and
caused the blood to pour down his face in a blinding
stream. McCoy has had a lot of bad luck with his head
of late years. In the 16th and 17th round a number
of humanitarians, who had apparently backed McCoy,
began to clamor that the fight should be stopped.
There was an excellent chance, if this didn’t happen,
that Clune, whose gameness and endurance are re-
markable, might stay on his feet and get the deci-
sion. No one appeared more astonished than Clune
when, at the end of the 18tli. he learned that he was
incapable of continuing further.

Dr. John Nicholson, whose light went out
at Benalla (Vic.) the other day, was a fine old sport,
lie was one of the best-known men in the north-
east of the State for half a century, and, beside his
medical duties, found time to cultivate wrestling (he
came from Cumberland) and interest himself in
coursing and other sporting matters. He had also a
passing interest in Ned Kelly’s gang. When it was
captured Nicholson went over to Glenrowan, and re-
lieved the chairman-bushranger oi a bullet in his
foot, which he had received in the final action. The
deceased medico was about 80 years young.

On the word of Mick Carter, who was
recently defeated by- A. B. Postle for the Australian
short-sprint championship, Jack Donaldson is coming
to Australia to be the star in a professional athletic
revival early in 1916. Donaldson was recently
defeated, for the second time, by ex-amateur AV. R.

star isn’t so bright as* it used to be. Age dims most,

Dealdn’s resignation as Australian Com-
missioner at Panama over what Andrew
Fisher refers to as “a point of etiquette” (i.e.,
Mahon’s recall of the secretary to the Com-
mission, and the appointment of a stranger
in his place) brings to mind that lligiu-
botham, when Chief Justice of Vic., threw
up the presidency of the Melbourne Centen-
nial Exhibition in 1888, because he objected
to the terms on which it was proposed that
Frederick S'argood should hold office as vice-
president. Deakin. being at the time Chief
Secretary, was in the same position as Mahon
is in now. After trying unsuccessfully to get
Miginbotham to withdraw his resignation
Alfred did just what Mahon has done, and
recommended the Executive Council to accept
it.

“You Will Be Astonished
How It Removes WrinKles.”
TOILET TALKS.
SIMPLICITY is the order of the day as
regards beauty culture. Many women
regularly A'isit the specialist to haA*e their
wrinkles ironed out with the help of hot
applications, cold creams and massage.
Most of us realise that there comes a time
when no amount of persuasion of this sort
will aA'ail. This process of “AA’rinkle remoA r -
ing” is wrong in principle. Both
the hot water and the massag-
ing tend to expand and loosen
the skin, besides softening the
muscular foundation. The very
opposite result should be aimed
at. The tissue should be strength-
ened and the skin tightened to
smooth out the wrinkles. For
this purpose ordinary parsidium
jelly, obtainable at all chemists,
may be used with beneficial
effects. Get about one shilling’s-
worth and apply like cold cream.
The face will quickly look years
younger.
IT is astonishing the number of women
whose faces show a more or less pro-
nounced growth of superfluous hair, and it
is much to be regretted that through ignor-
ance, or wrong treatment, the majority of
them have made matters considerably worse
by causing the hairs to grow more quickly
and stronger than before. It only requires
a little thought to realise the folly of it all.
Removing the surface growth for a few days
may give temporary relief, but in order to
obtain permanent results the hair roots
must be killed. Caustic depilatories are
worse than useless, and on no account
h
should the hairs be pulled out. Apart from
the electric needle, which is a costly and
painful process, any chemist will tell you
that the most reliable home treatment is
pure powdered pheminol. This substance
has a devitalising effect upon the hair roots,
in addition to which it removes all trace of
the objectionable hair in a few seconds. The
recommended treatment gradu-
ally. but surely, dissolves out the
hair follicles, which is the only
method of permanently ridding
oneself of this embarrassing
disfigurement.
HOW often do you see one
of the old-fashioned pow-
der pots on your friend’s dress-
ing table? Not very frequently.
I am sure. They are fast being
converted to a more useful pur-
pose. The truth of the matter
is, women are at last beginning
to realise that powder is the
“root of all evil” as far as their
complexions are concerned, at any rate, and
are wisely discarding the powder puff
for that ordinary, innocent-looking sub-
stance known as cleminite. What they
do is to obtain about an ounce from
their chemist and dissolve it in four table-
spoonfuls of water. This gives a lotion
which immediately imparts a delightful
bloomy appearance to the skin : removes that
horrid greasy appearance, and renders pow-
dering quite unnecessary. The result lasts
all day long under the most trying condi-
tions, and what is far more important, im-
proves the complexion instead of ruining it. fi

War. of course, and drought. There has
been “a considerable reduction in turnover,”
with “high prices ruling for all the principal
products and commodities used by the co.”
A mystifying feature of the case is that this
co.’s principal and biggest competitor showed
larger profits than ever in its last half-year;
which suggests that there are compensating
movements somewhere, though the A.B.C.
seems to have missed them. The flotation
was a bad one to begin with. Especially
considering the tenure on which the co. held
its premises, the amount paid for goodwill
was very excessive. Of a capital of £35,000
more than half was represented by goodwill
and another £3750 by leaseholds.. The whole
or almost the whole of this was in respect of
businesses carried on in two premises in
Pitt-street. One was presently relin-
quished, being unprofitable ; the other occu-
pied headquarters held under lease expiring
in 1917. To pay so much money for busi-
nesses hanging on such a thin thread was
quite mad. Twelve months ago the direc-
tors “regretted to have to inform share-
holders” that they had “failed to secure an
extension of the lease of the premises” ; and
though they were hopeful of securing other
headquarters, all that they have secured is
Baumann’s Cafe, and this involved a deben-
ture issue of £5OOO, while to provide a fac-
tory ran the co. into a mortgage debt of
£6500. In other words, after the co. had
paid £20,000 or thereabouts for a business
and business premises, it finds the whole lot
of such little value that it has had to face
a heavy outlay and borrow £11,500 to get
much the same thing. It isn’t very surpris-
ing, therefore, that the shareholders are
going hungry. The present position is shown
hereunder: —
Capital . . .. . . £35,000
Cash and hook debts . . £1,192
Stocks .. .. . . 4,536
Plant .. .. .. 14,575
Freeholds .. . . . . 17,000
Sundries .. .. .. 510
£37,813
Less liabilities .. 15,483
Capital represented by froth and fluff £12,670
Froth and fluff being goodwill (of a busi-
ness which isn’t paying divs.), leases, etc.
And though £22,330 of the capital is appar-
ently intact, it 1 has to be noted that £14,575
-is represented by plant; and this paper won’t
make an affidavit that the co. could get
£14,575 for it. The Bulletin doesn’t
know either whether the £17,000 represented
by a bakehouse, etc., is good value, suppos-
ing the co. had to offer it for sale.

Tasmania has been feeling off-color, apart
altogether from the pain of the war; and
this co.’s earnings have suffered. Although
the trust estates in hand total £763,769 com-
pared with £757,014 at the previous balance,
the commissions amounted to only £l2BO as
against £1430 for the six months to Septem-
ber, 1914, and £1534 to March, 1914. In-
terest has also shrunk, though this may have
been due to the calling in of money to com-
plete the payment for the co.’s recent pur-
chase, the old Commercial Bank premises.
The debt on this has been cleared up, and
the co.’s liabilities reduced to £I9S. Even
though Shrunk, the interest earnings were
£434 for the half-year; and as the dividend
required only £536, the bulk of the commis-
sion went back into the business, where it is
a guarantee fund for beneficiaries. Paid
capital is £lO,OOO, equal to £1 on £5 shares.
There is thus in addition to the paid capital
and the big reserves another £40,000 waiting
to be called up in the remote event of the
beneficiaries’ funds being mislaid. Of this
£40,000 the co. can call up only £15,000 for
its own use. The balance is solely for the
protection of clients.
• # * it
Westralia’s gold-mining dividends for
March totalled £86,678, and carried the aggre-
gate since the beginning of things to
£24,87.1,505. April’s contribution adds
another £50,000 or thereabouts. Nearly all
the money still comes from three or four Kal-
goorlie mines and two or three outsiders, and
the profits of all but a couple of them are
getting less. Between 1904 and 1914 divi-
dends decreased from £2,051,798 to £799,392
and profits were 11s. per ton less. Costs
were at bedrock six years ago: owing to fuel
. and water getting dearer they have since
gone up Is. 3d. per ton, and as the biggest
producers have now got to go deeper, exes,
are not likely to shrink again. An inter-
esting fact is that while 16,848 men were
employed in 1904. when 2,432,171 tons were
treated, only 11.722 men were employed in
1914, when 2,702,096 tons were handledj.
The explanation is that mechanical appli-
ances are more numerous, while the standard
of labor is also higher to-day.

Real Hair Grower
Found at Fast!
The Great American Discovery, “Crystolis,”
Grows Hair in 30 Days.
We Can Prove Our Claims. Read Our Guarantee.
Try It at Our RisK. Post Coupon To-day.
Here’s good news at last for men and
women whose hair is falling, who are grow-
ing bald and grey, whose scalps are covered
with dandruff that nothing seems' to -keep
away, and whose heads itch like mad.
Good news even for those who imagine
themselves hopelessly and incurably bald, or
who suffer from hair or scalp trouble of any
kind.
We have had granted to us the sole Aus-
tralasian rights for the great American dis-
covery, Crystolis, the new hair remedy that
in America and Europe has been called the
most wonderful discovery of the century,
having been awarded Gold Medals at the
big Paris and Brussels Expositions.
Hundreds of men and women have
written us to tell of the phenomenal results
obtained by its use. People who have been
bald for years tell how they now glory in
their beautiful hair. Others who have had
dandruff all their lives say they have now a
clean, healthy scalp, and that hair stopped
falling after a few applications of this won-
derful new treatment.
We don’t care whether you are bothered
with falling hair, prematurely grey hair,
matted hair, brittle hair, or stringy hair;
dandruff, itching scalp, or any or all forms
of hair trouble, we want you to try
“CRYSTOLIS” at our risk.
Following is convincing evidence from a
few of those who have used Crystolis, and
know its "reat value from personal experi-
ence :
Mr. George F. Morse says: —
“I lost my hair 18 years ago. Have used less
than one treatment. My head is now covered with a
thick growth of fine hair of natural color. No more
itching, no more falling hair, no more dandruff.”
/ Rev. F. M. Campbell writes: —
“I am delighted to say Crystolis has stopped the
itching, and a fine growth of new hair has appeared.”
Dr. Charles Lyndon states:
“To-day I have twice as piuch hair on the top of
my head as when I commenced using your remedy.
You have unquestionably solved the problem of
growing new hair.”
Rev. H. A. Handrick writes:
“Crystolis started my hair growing after the first
week’s treatment.”
Dr. J. S. Riley declares:
“I have used Crystolis on the head of a patient,
and find it stopped the falling hair, and is satis-:
factory in every way.”
Mr. V. L. Maurer says:
“Crystolis is the only hair-grower that actually
grows hair.”
Mr. Geo. H. Kaiser writes: —
“The itching and greasy appearance of my scalp
has entirely disappeared, and new hair is coming
in fine, nearly one inch long on the top of my head.”
Mrs. H. S. Arlin says:—
“I have had wonderful results from using just one
treatment of Crystolis. It has stopped my hair from
falling out and cured that itching scalp. My scalp
is now covered with new hair all over, about an inch
long, and is coming in fast.”
Mr. L. F. Armbrecht writes:
“Before using Crystolis my hair was harsh and
brittle and rapidly falling out. My head was full
of dandruff, and I had a bald spot about two inches
in diameter. Since I started to use Crystolis the
dandruff has gone, my hair has stopped falling, and
feels as soft as silk, and the bald spot is covered
with a growth of new hair —not fuzz —but real hair,
half an inch long.”
Mrs. Z. Unger declares:
“My husband, who is 33 years old, was rapidly
becoming bald, and came to the conclusion he
would have to wear a wig. I decided to use
Crystolis, and with two or three applications the
sliekness common to bald heads disappeared, and
with less than one treatment short hairs, very fine
and soft, made their appearance through the scalp.
This new hair is now an inch or more long, and
other hair keeps coming.”
Beautiful Hair
and Lots of it,
if you use
‘Crystolis”

derful successes of Crystolis com-
ing from all parts of the World.

Grey, Thin Hair
If you are ill you know that safe, grateful, sure,
“there’s-no-need-to-worry” kind of feeling you have
when you know that there is a clever, skilled doctor
handy, _ who can and will cure you of -your bodily
ailments, and set you on your feet again? That is
the safe, confident kind of feeling you have when
you seek the aid of Margaret Windeyer for relief from
hair and scalp ailments. She is a clever, experi-
enced English woman, who has spent the whole of
her life learning all about hair and scalp troubles, and
so perfect is her thorough, sound, skilled, sensible and
scientific system of hair-culture that she knows from
her long, long experience that there is no case of
falling hair, baldness, dandruff, oily or dry hair,
greyness (mind you, greyness, too) or other hair or
scalp ailment, which she cannot thoroughly and per-
manently cure. And when her treatment has stopped
the falling, banished the dandruff, made your thin,
weak, short, dead, miserable hair grow thick, long,
strong, healthy and beautiful, and brought the lost
color back to every grey thread (no matter how grey
your hair or how long it has been grey), you know
that that is the end of your hair troubles for all time,
because, as the years pass by, your hair cannot go
grey again, for it shall be cured of its greyness.
Nor will your hair do aught but just go on growing
—growing, growing thicker, longer, healthier and
better month after month.' It is far better to seek
the aid.of a skilled, experienced hair specialist and
get cured of your hair troubles ONCE AND FOR ALL
than to try this, that and the other thing, and fail so
dismally to do your hair any good.
Consultations are free.
There are private waiting and other rooms for men
folk and for women folk.
Country folk who send a few combings for examina-
tion under the microscope will be written a long
letter, charge, explaining all about their
hair troubles and cost of cure. Enclose Id. stamp for
reply. Margaret Windeyer’s treatment may be carried
out in your own home if you desire. Her address:

An Australian daily-paper editor who has
been struggling for years to get a knight-
hood is likely to achieve his ambition
shortly. Some time ago he was given to
understand that his name was certain to be
in the “honors” list, and he felt so cocksure
of getting the bauble that he prefaced his
name with “Sir” in his autobiographical
eulogy, prepared carefully and laboriously
in advance ready for printing in his news-
paper. It is alleged that the notice is still
in type awaiting the cable announcement.
“Jeames” :—-
Felix Semon, the retired throat specialist, who,
the cables say, has written to the London Times
denouncing Germany, is more, English than German,
despite the fact that he was born in Prussia and
fought through the war of 1870. Twenty years ago
he was the biggest man in his line in Harley-street.
He was embittered against the officialdom of his
native land. Hence, when the throat trouble of the
Kaiser’s father became acute, Morell Mackenzie and
Mark Hovell—both Britishers- —were sent for, and
Semon was overlooked, although he had attended the
old Emperor previously. I had an accident which
affected, my hearing, and went to Semon to see what
he could do. I found a small, slim, sallow man with
piercing black eyes and a Teuton manner. He sat in
a large room containing the signed photographs of
every singer I had ever heard of. “What are your
symptoms?” he inquired. I told him. “There is
nothing to be done. Spend no more money on doc-
tors. Three guineas, please.” And the interview
was over. He was one of the founders of the
German Athenaeum, now closed—the place which the
Sydney papers mixed up with the Athenaeum in Pall
Mall at the beginning of the war.
As often as not that half of the Legisla-
ture which is supposed to be a Chamber for
revision is merely, because of its ignorance,
a Chamber for derision. It can’t very well
be otherwise, seeing that, while bills are
introduced to the Assembly by men who are
all more or less experts, the other Chamber
has to depend for its enlightenment upon a
single Minister, who has to swat up a super-
ficial acquaintance with everv Bill. So it
happened that in 1902 the N.S.W. Leg.
Council excised from a Wine Adulteration
Bill a clause prohibiting the use of sugar
in the making of the mocker. Wine of an
inferior sort can be made of grapeskins and
sugar; and the blank ignorance of the “re-
vising” House has enabled the cheap wine
fakers to do great damage to the growing
reputation of Australian vintages. The
Holman Government is therefore now com-
pelled to bring in legislation to rectify the
ancients’ mistake.
THE BODYSNATCHERS.
Two beings did halt
Before, a narrow Bed
Prepared to unearth
The- grim outlined Dead,
•When ’neath the mystic moon
The sexton Brave
Like a spectre appeared
Before the grave.
He was struck by a spade
And fell with a thud
And ;bespattered the tomb
With his crimson Blood.
Realising their aim
The two monsters sped
Along a bordered' path
From the yard of the dead.
.... Obo: It is emphatic, anyhow:—
DER KAISER.
There was a dirty German and he thought to have
some fun,
So he got a dirty submarine fitted out with tube
and gun,
He blazed away at merchantmen and helpless little
trawlers,
Did the dirty little German and his dirty little
crawlers.
And the dirty Germans who survive to see Der
Tag
Will live to see their nation and their dirty rotten
rag
Obliterated, torn to shreds by the foe they hotly
hate,
And Hell above and Hell below shall be that Hell
Hound’s fate.

THE BOOK
OF THE
MOTOR CAR.
')
An Indispensable Work
for Every Owner, Driver
or Chauffeur.
The time is past when it required an ex-
pert engineer to drive' a car, but a working
knowledge of the various parts of a car and
their functions is still essential to really
successful driving, and the importance of this
work to every owner and driver of a motor-
car, cycle or cycle-car can hardly be over-
estimated.
The Book of the Motor-Car is the first
really comprehensive work on motor-cars,
motor-cycles and cycle-cars ever published.
By the careful study of its chapters the
rawest amateur can learn the principles upon
which his car works, but at the same time it
is so comprehensive and so striking in its
detail that even the skilled expert will find
it a book of enthralling interest and ex-
treme utility, while the practical motorist
will find it auite indispensable. It should be
as much a part of the equipment of a garage
as an oilcan or a lifting-jack.
DRIVING and REPAIRS.
The book is full of invaluable information
on all problems of driving and repairing a
car, instructions being given for all possible
difficulties in language that can be under-
stood bv the most unmechanical mind. The
following are a few of the subjects dealt
with: —
Cylinders, valves of all kinds, different
types of engines, carburetters, ignition,
silencers, gears and clutches, radiators, cool-
ing systems, brakes, lubrication, lighting sys-
tems, artillery and wire wheels, tyres, fuels
and how to use them (including all the new
petrol substitutes), tools and repair appli-
ances, etc., etc.
MOTOR-CARS and MOTOR-CYCLES.
The work pays full attention to motor-
cycles and cycle-cars, full details and in-
struction being given for all those points
wherein they must be treated differently
from the more powerful motor-car. It is
profusely illustrated with full-page plates,
drawing in plan section and elevation, dia-
grams and photographs, as well as a series
of sectional movable models in color showing
in detail the actual working parts of a car.
All interested in motoring in any form

“ Electrical
Installations.”
By RANKIN KENNEDY, C.E.
New Edition Just Ready.
The necessity for all electricians, whether
amateur or professional, being well acquainted
with all designs for installations that have
given good results will be readily acknow-
ledged by those whom the matter concerns.
AVhile there are numerous text-books deal-
ing with one branch or another of electrical
engineering, they are all prepared for the
student, and their contents deal rather with
theory than with practice.
The aim of “Electrical Installations” is to
assist the practical man who is concerned
with electrical installations in any form, and
this because it is recognised that there exists
a very large class engaged in constructive
and installation work, and a still larger
class whose duty it is to take care of the
machinery employed in working by elec-
tricity. Most of these men have picked up
a working knowledge of their employment.
What they need is to study the elements of
the science of the subject. These elements
are fully treated of in the first volume; and
on the sound foundation thus laid the
author, who is a civil and electrical engi-
neer by profession, and recognised as being
in the front rank of electricians and engi-
neers, proceeds to deal with every possible
form of electrical installation, their prin-
ciples and practical application.
This work describes and illustrates the
best practice in all branches of the electric
light and power installation business; the
last volume treats of all the lighter branches
of electrical manufactures—telephones, wire-
less telegraphy, and kindred subjects.
This new revised edition of the work
justly claims to have brought all subjects'up
to date with descriptions and information re-
garding recent machinery and apparatus.
The matter has also been re-arranged so that
all information relating to one subject fol-
lows consecutively.
The illustrations number 1000, and there
are eight fine plates in each volume. In
addition, each nlate contains a colored card-
board sectional model of an electrical
machine in four sections superposed.
TWO OPINIONS.
Mr. PONTECORVO, Engineer, The Brit-
ish Westinghouse Electric Co., Ltd.,
Manchester: • r
The work is very clear in its explanations, and
gives, by means of well-illustrated experiments, a
complete idea of the electrical phenomenon. The
chapter with hints as to how to build experimental
apparatus seems particularly useful. Printing and
illustrations are clear and accurate.
Mr. H. SHAW, M.1.E.E., A.M.I. Mech.E.,
Manager, Ilford Electricity Supply
and Tramways, Ilford:
I consider this work is all you claim for it. The
matter is clear and up to date, and the diagrams and
plates are particularly good. The article on supply
meters should prove very useful. This is a work that
everyone engaged in the practical applications of
electricity should have access to.

The indecent practice of civil servants
deputationising Ministers and politicians for
“rises” when elections are pending is ramp-
ant in Queensland. Philp has been bom-
barded by.teachers in Townsville and Cabinet
Ministers almost everywhere.' Of course the
petitioners get what they deserve—plenty of
promises.
From a Northern politician
Minister Barnes was asked at a recent meeting:
“Why don’t you keep the wheat in Queensland in
place of exporting it, so that pur own people may
have the benefit?” To which query came the prompt
reply: “And what would ,be our position if Tas-
mania kept all her potatoes down there? Wouldn’t
potatoes be three times as dear?” The Ma State will
yet get a taste of the bludgeon wherewith the Hol-
man buccaneers have belted the sister States.
Denham hasn’t spent a life in the grease
trade for nothing. During the 1911 session,
just before the last election, 10 railway bills
were put through. Then there was a lull for
two years. Last session the Government
put on a great spurt and sent through 16
proposals, all within the last month of the
dying Parliament. Yet if you told Denham
that he was holding out public money to
bribe the electors he would, as an honest
butterman, be quite annoyed.
“Nil Sine Lahore” : The Brisbane Grammar
School’s military record is something extra.
A hundred and seventy-three “old boys” are
known to be on service, including a colonel,
three lieutenant-colonels and five majors, and
three have staff appointments. The A.N.A.
shield, the Ralston challenge trophy (cham-
pion cadet team), Lady Denman’s colors for
the best all-round cadet team of the Com-
monwealth, the Courier challenge cup,
orizes for cadet march past, champion medal
for rifle-shooting among Queensland cadets,'
apd a heap of other prizes for individual effi-
ciency have been won by the school corps
within the past few months. And it isn’t a
sudden outburst. Twent.v-five years ago the
school won the Sargood Shield—a great tea-
tray of a thing—in . competition with cadets
from the rest of Australia. , ,Dr. Joseph
Wassell, lately dead at. Thursday Island,
was an old scholar, and about* the best
boy-shot of hiskday in Australia.’
If -Labor wins in Queensland now or soon,
M. J. Kirwan will probably get the port-
folio of Railways. Less than four years
ago he was working on the Central railway
platforms at Brisbane. It was he who led
the railway porters, shunters and shed hands
out on strike during the big tramway
trouble. When the strike eel-lapsed- the
Railway Department appointed a Board to
hear and judge applicants for re-admission
to the service. Kirwan came before the
Board, but had no intention to ask for re-
instatement, his Parliamentary candidature
having been endorsed for North Brisbane.
One of the members remarked jokingly: “So
we shall not hear your melodious voice on
the Central platform again, Mr. Kirwan?”
“No,” retorted Mick; “but you may hear it
from another platform.” And they did hear,
for the porter beat Pompom Forrest by 34
votes.
THE REST FOLLOW.
IMPECUNIOUS SUITOR: "There are other things in this world besides money, you know."
SHE: “Oh, lots —if one only has the money.”
“Politicus”: Apropos The Bulletin’s
comments on compulsory voting (13/5/T5).
Queensland Liberalism, under the belief
that its supporters are more prone to
neglect voting than its opponents, has re-
solved to try compulsion as a remedy.
Herein Liberalism has made a fatal blunder.
The truth is that the workers of Banana-
,land fail in hundreds and thousands to
record their suffrages, a fact patent to any
kqen observer —and this Liberal remedy will
inapt these negligent droves up to the poll,
mostly to vote anti-Denham. But note
'how these Liberals and Laborites, who are
both so anxious to compel people to vote,
exert themselves to keep out of the field
any candidate who isn’t absolutely flaming
Bed or wholly and beautifully Blue. Com-
pulsory voting under such circumstances
means that an elector is forced to vote for
one of two parties, to both of which he may
be violently opposed, as thousands of
Queenslanders are at the present moment.

QUEENSLAND,
F. BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, May 15, 1915.
My Dear Tiiargomindah,— .
The war pulse is quickening here. The
other night, at Brisbane Club, Governor
Goold-Adams, who was one of the gutests of
L. M. Bond (president of the club and of
the Chamber of Commerce), dropped a hand-
grenade. In a few words of farewell to
some Bananalanders who are going to where
the guns are growling, he said he wanted
the leading business men and, scientists to
meet him at an early date and see whether
it wasn’t possible to turn out munitions of
war with local appliances. He had appar-
ently a conviction that something useful
could be done, and bj way of encourage-
ment cited the manufacture of the field-gun
in Kimberley during the Boer war. Follow-
ing the hint thrown out the host of the
evening stirred up the Chamber of Com-
merce, and a meeting will presently rake
over the proposal and see if there’s anything
in it.
The party at the Brisbane Club was
mightily successful, and the departing men
had the time of their lives. The only L- M.
Bond infant is a lieutenant in the 25th 'Bat-
talion, and he and most of his brother offi-
cers will long remember their farewell.
party. Colonel Goddard and Captain A. E.
Harte were the special guests of the even-
ing, or, rather, they were to have been, but
Goddard had gone south to help acquit
some military friends at a court-martial.
The Goold-Adamses were at the Lieder-
tafel concert on Tuesday night, and had the
satisfaction of viewing Emilie Lambert, the
imported soloist, garbed in a gown of pale
canary satin with an overdress of white
lace. Her voice was nearly as pretty and
was wonderfully trained, and her three or four
songs greatly appealed to the audience’s
appetite. Fred Monument was the other
soloist. His song from “Hiawatha” was
something to remember when things' are not
all they’re cracked up to be. He is that
somewhat rare thing, a dramatic baritone.
The Imperial Service Club is to be opened
next , week. The drawing up of rules was
left to the men of the committee —A. H.
Whittingham, “Morry” Baldwin (for many
years secretary of the Rugby Union) and
treasurer Tom Robertson —and astonished
everyone. “No cards and no billiards on
Sunday” was one pious item on the list. It
was left to the women present to hold the fort
for the boys, and though he is not permitted
to gamble on the premises, Tommy Banana-
land can play cards, and will be able to
have 50 up even on the Day of Rust.
Incidentally, in a city feeding resort the
other day two of the k-nuts were discussing
the alleged misdemeanors of our troops in
Egypt, when suddenly a grey-haired lady
arose and in a clear voice said: “May 1
remark that the worst man who has gone to
fight for his country is better than the best
man who has stayed at home?” The k-nuts
looked as if they could have swallowed them-
selves bodily.
The Red Cross concert that Mrs. Symes
and Miss Mactaggart arranged last week
brought in £134; and the expenses were less
than a fiver. Who says women have no
head for business? Why, we’ll cadge any-
thing rather than pay for it.
Each day sees a fresh casualty-list pub-
lished, and each day a few more brave
Northern men are shown to have fallen out
of the ranks. But since Ashmead Bartlett s
account of the fighting in the Dardanelles
reached us every sorrowing mother feels
how great a share of pi;ide has come her way,
and there isn’t a father but walks more
proudly to think the boy was there.
J. A. Robinson, 8.A., lecturer at the
Teachers’ Training College, heard. the bugle
call, and is now under canvas. “Robbie had a
unique experience. He has been 10 days in
camp, and has risen from private to cor-
poral, and then to sergeapt, and now flaunts
the one star of a second lieutenant. . To-
day Dr. Shirley handed over, a wristlet
watch and a collapsible pillow, little memen-
toes from the staff and students at the
College.
Mclntosh’s latest venture, the new Tivoli
Theatre, was opened this afternoon. Aider-
man Down (Mayor of Brisbane) did the
needful, and afterwards an excited gentle-
man made a lengthy speech till the gallery
rudely counted him out. Then the Follies
gave a performance, and judging by the
encouraging noises of the audience their show
will be a popular one.
The drought has really broken this time,
and things are already brightening up. Visi-
tors I on Outback stations are even allowed to
have a bath now.
There is a sensational story hovering
round a well-known musical family, whose
charming daughter is reported to have
married her music master in Hamburg.
The lady did not see that any such unim-
portant happening as a war ought to inter-
fere with her musical studies, so she just
stayed where she was. Now comes the
story that the master, who is said to be a .
Turkish subject, has persuaded his very
gifted pupil to become his life’s partner.
As, however, the rumor has come through
a number of countries too numerous to
mention, there is a possibility of the facts
having been distorted en route. It is hoped
so, anyway.
Captain Jack Carandini Wilson, who is
reported dangerously wounded at the Darda-
nelles, is a grandson of the late Rosa Caran-
dini, a nephew of Mrs. Palmer, the well-
known Melbourne singer, and cousin of
Queensland’s handsome soprano, Mrs. Gil-
bert Wilson. Captain Jack was born in a
suburb of Brisbane, when his father Robert
and uncle Gilbert Wilson were potentates
of finance in the northern State. He has
been for years a soldier, but recently dipped
his pinions in the Inky Way.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Philp is again a certainty for Townsville.
He is such a decent, unassuming fellow, that
every election his host of personal friends
forget what a poor politician he is.
Denham visited the railway workshops at
Ipswich the other day looking for votes, and
at dinner-time found himself in the big new
dining-room where a midday feed is obtain-
able. An invitation to eat with the officers
was declined, the humble butterman an-
nouncing that what was good enough for
the men was good enough for him. So he
struggled with a working-man’s dinner, eaten
at a bare wooden table-top, and made a
speech afterwards. He was able to assure
the workmen there would be no retrench-
ment before July; but he didn’t say a word
about the bridge his crowd imported from
Germany when Queensland ironworkers were
being sacked because there was no work
for them to do locally.

The Spectator: “An intensely interesting
account of 4 * the political events in which Lordi
Cromer ‘kept his end up’ against the persistent
intrigues of Tewfik’s shifty ‘successor. The'
manner in which Lord Cromer prevented the
young Khedive from doing rriuch harm is a'
perfect lesson in the art of healing with the
Oriental mind.”

“Darnoc”: Another story of the casual-
ness of Tommy Kangaroo. When “with
Holmes’s crowd in liabaul” half a dozen
“tommies,” chatting on the roadside, per-
mitted Major Heritage to walk past with-
out officially seeing him. Now, the Major
is a great stickler for the “smart and sol-
dier-like manner” mentioned in the Red
Book. So he walked past again. Still no
salute. With a puzzled „ look on his face
and in a tone of deep concern he approached
the group and asked: “I say, my noble
warriors! Have I done anything to offend
you ? Have I hurt your feelings ?” The
swaddies hastened to assure him that he
had not wounded their susceptible natures
in any way. The Major shock his head
and remarked in quite a friendly manner:
“Well, by Jove, it’s strange!” One of the
tommies asked, “What is strange, sir?”
Speaking in sorrow the Major replied:
“Well, when I walk down this road the
Germans lift their hats to me, the Chinese
bow to me, the niggers salute me; but my
own men don’t even say, ‘Hullo Francis!
How are you?’”
“Spasmode” is discursive :
So Kitchener, at his ease, puts on an old pair
of pants and mucks about in the garden among thp
violets and the daisies. In the generation beforp
last Melbourne’s two best-known pawnbrokers, neithep
of them Jews, both published their respective
volumes of sentimental poetry. They were hard
nails. Browning was a third pawnbroker, also
non-llebrevv. A deacon of the - Collins-street Inde-
pendent Church he was, with long white hair 'and
the dial of a Peabody. I was at a Richmond concert.
A very sentimental looking man stood up with two
young ladies, and they sang, “Pretty Birdie, Fly
Away! ” A matron in the audience exclaimed
“Beautiful!” but suddenly changed her note to
disgust. “That’s our butcher-boy,” she snorted:
Sir Barnet Skettles is charmed with a little ' man
who talks learnedly on the national debt, exdhange,
currency and “What shall we do if there is a drain
of gold ?” Sir Barnet: “Who is that very intelli-
gent little gentleman? Is he your local member?”
Dombey: “JSfo. That’s our dancing-master.”
Pheugh! Skettles is almost sick. Has he been
talking about national debt and drain of gold with
a, dancing-master? :
These politicians are comedians if
consider them properly. One day last week
a Sydney paper accused Holman of inten-
tion to appoint ex-Education Minister Car-
michael a Commissioner to fihd an irriga-
tion policy for the Government. Carmichael
immediately waylaid a reporter and com-
plained that this unauthorised, use of his
name—this persistent shoving of him into
the. limelight—was most distasteful, his one
desire being to be left in obscurity. The; 1
yarn was published; but by next day Car-i
michael had found obscurity for 24 hours
sp agreeable that he burst out in the news-
papers with a story about all he had done
fo establish a Conservatorium of Music
in N. S. Wales —and particularly about how,
he., had throttled a projected hash-house
which then Works Minister Griffith wanted
the Government to erect on 1 the Conser-
vatorium site. At that stage it might have
been recalled that it was this same Griffith;
who, when he succeeded Carmichael as
Minister for Education, promptly announced
that he found the Department 50 years
behind the times.
Mahoney, M.H.R., who had a walk-over
for Howe’s old seat, Dailey (N.S.W.), was
originally a grocer, and organised the
Grocers’ Assistants’ Union, of which he was
secretary until it merged into the Shap
Assistants’ Union. Subsequently k'e Was
employed by the City Council as a clerk. His
history is. quite commonplace, but if he \
sticks to his Parliamentary duties as he haS
stuck to the Labor movement he will pass
muster. Moreover, he is a believer in Aus-
tralian industry, and that is something in
these times of imported trawlers and shindi-
kits.
“Groper” : Melbourne newspapers refer to
lately-dead Bigliop Moorhouse as “a man
loved by everyone.” Have a look at the
bust in the Public Library. Head, well
proportioned; intellectual; no relics of
emotional crises on the smooth, even face;
a mouth distinctly hard, without trace of
smile. Not a man this for an erring curate
to go to. A strong man and a ruler—-or
some men. At the Gordon Memorial meet-
ing, when fat aldermen were being ragged •
by‘red-flaggers, he was put up to save the
situation. Turning on the tap of emotional
patriotism he had the crowd wildly cheering
and waving its hat. But when, after being
elected Chancellor of the University, he
essayed to address the students and.<others,
lie got beans, lost his temper and bellowed
with rage. Moorhouse made a mistake in
leaving Victoria, and in later life he bitterly
repented his step into a place where, he
said, “what was needed was a tame cat.”
A Maorilander named J. H. Howell re-
cently struck something he thought would
increase the efficiency of the submarine', and
believing he had a big thing on hand, rushed
away to London with it. He had hardly
finished explaining it when the Admiralty
grabbed the patent and thrust a lot of cash
into the Maorilander’s purse. The prompt}
ness with which John Bull closed the busi-
ness suggests that Howell’s discovery is of
some importance.
“Competition for the trade in whisky
being keen and the profit very small,” the
two biggest Scotch whisky-foundries, Dewar’s
and Buchanan’s, have decided to amalgamate,
and so cut down expenses. The capital oil
the new co. will be £5,000,000. At present,
Buchanan’s paid capital is £850.070. De-
war’s is £600,000, and recent dividends have
been: 1902-5. 20 p.c.; 1905-7, 25 p.c.; 1908,
274 p.c.; 1909, 37 V p.c.; 1910, 35 p.c.; 1911,
374 p.c.; 1911-1914, 424 p.c., and for the
year to the end of January, 1915, 374 p.c. A
drop of 5 p.c. No wonder they are getting
alarmed !
The apple-growers of Maoriland are out
to capture the South American market. Ip
December the Government sent G. L. Tacop,
a well-known fruit-grower of Motueka, as a
Special' Commissioner for three months to
try to develop a regular market for the iri-
creasingly-numerous M.L. pippin. His re-
ports urge the M.L. grower to jump 1 in
quickly, especially to the Argentina market.
And- Maoriland is jumping like a fleet of
kangaroos. .. .. .. ;

HOW TO GET RID OF YOUR
GREY HAIR
A Simple, Sups, Harmless Treatment
which can be used at home with
complete success. Age no obstacle.
COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS
FREE
I AM A WOMAN who belongs to a prematurely
grey haired family. My father was grey before he
was 30, and two of my brothers as well as my sister
became grey early in life. Before the age of 25 I
developed grey hairs, which became quite embar-
rassing to me—socially, and also in business. I
LOST THREE GOOD POSITIONS for no other reason
than my fading hair. The greyness increased with
alarming rapidity, and at 28 I LOOKED LIKE. A
WOMAN OF 45. One day I was seriously thinking
of buying one of the many Grey Hair Restorers
that are extensively advertised, when I casually
mentioned the subject to an acquaintance—a scien-
tific man, and, as I after-
wards learnt, a great
student of the Che-
mistry of the Hair.
He strongly ad-
vised me to have
nothing what-
ever to do with,
these concoc-
tions. He poin-
ted out that
SUCH PREPAR-
ATIONS EVENT-
UALLY RUINED
THE HAIR, and
in the meantime
rarely deceived
even the. casual
observer. He sug-
gested that I try a
formula that he had
perfected after a con-
siderable time, which,
by a certain chemical
action on the pigmentary colouring cells restored
the hair to its normal colour. In replv to my en-
quiries, he assured me that the formula wag not
only absolutely harmless, but would develop A
STRONG AND BEAUTIFUL CROWTH OF HAIR. My
friend wrote out his prescription, which I had made
up, and after carefully following the instructions for
a few days, I was surprised and delighted to find my
hair becoming richer and darker in tone. The re-
colouring process continued until after some few
weeks my hair actually once again possessed the
natural shade of my girlish days. Since then I HAVE
SEEN INUNDATED WITH ENQUIRIES from friends
arid also persons unknown to me, who came to hear
of this wonderful preparation. Having become con-
vinced that I have found A REMEDY OF EXTRA-
ORDINARY MERIT, and which is quite harmless, I
have resolved to offer it for sale, as I am certain
from my own experience that it will prove an ines-
timable boon to any man or woman who finds grey
hair to be the same serious handicap it was to me.
It is a Guaranteed Genuine Preparation, and I
OFFER A REWARD OF £lOO if it will not re-colour
Grey Hair to Original, Natural Shade.

ration I am willing to send you COMPLETE IN-

Big Ben—Two good alarms in one
Take your choice in Big Ben. He
rings either way you wish five
straight minutes or every other half
minute for all of ten minutes unless
you switch him off. He’s two alarms
in one.
If you’re a light sleeper, turn on
the half-minute taps before you go
to bed. If you sleep heavily, set the
five minute call. You can slumber
then without the get-up worry on
your mind.
When morning comes, and it’s an-
nounced by Big Ben’s jolly bell, you
can’t help getting up at once, for Big
Ben never fails to get you wide awake.
Big Ben is really three good clocks
in one, two excellent alarms and a
fine time-keeper to keep in any room
and tell time all day by.
If you have got to get up bright
and early, if you have to get down to
work on time, ask for Big Ben at
your jewellers, and try him for a
week. You’ll never want to be with-
out him afterwards.
Big Ben stands seven inches tall.
He is triple nickel-plated and wears
an inner vest of steel that insures
him for life. His big, bold figures
and hands are easy to read in the
dim morning light. His large, com-
fortable keys almost wind them-
selves. He rings five minutes steadily
or ten intermittently. If he is oiled
every other year, there is no telling
how long he will last.
Big Ben is made in La Salle,
Illinois, U.S.A., by Westclox. His
price is 12/6, postage 1/-extra. If
you cannot find him in your town,
send a money order to the makers’
Australian office, Westclox, cr. King
and Kent Sts., Sydney, They will
have one mailed to you by the
nearest jeweller.

With enterprise and judicious sub-editing
Federal Hansard might outstrip, all rivals
in circulation while the war lasts. As the
only journal in Australia free from military
censorship it is in a unique position to pub-
lish “scoops.” The other day, for instance,
it was announced in reply to a question in
the House of lieps. that the Australian
troops were at _ the Dardanelles. Here
was a chance for an uncensored Han-
sard to bring out a “special” and cause its
reptile contemporaries to gnash their fangs;
but nothing was done. When a paper misses
like this, it deserves a circulation less than
that of the Australian: Canary.

The Simplified Speling Sosieti (of which
Australia’s own Gilbert Murray is president)
sends its kompliments to The Bulletin
from London, and remarks that the time is
ripe “tu bring the feeling for poetri from

J. C. Wilson, dangerously wounded at
the Dardanelles, dropped his pen as dramatic
critic of Sydney Sunday Times to get to
the Front. He originally took to the trade
of arms in England, and held a commission
under John Bull. After coming through
the Boer war he resigned, went to America
and variously employed his time at farming
(in Canada) and on thq stage and in press
work (U.S.). From Los Angeles lie drifted
down to Maori] and, and, later, to Australia.
He joined the First Expeditionary fyrce in
N.S.W, as a lieutenant, and was promoted
in Egypt to a captaincy.

Another paper, The Camp, takes up its
bluey and joins the procession on Sydney’s
Inky Way. Its first number contains the
following ultimatum:—
The Camp will be devoted entirely to the welfare,
interests, amusement and recreation of the military
and naval services engaged on behalf of the Common-
wealth, in defence of the British Empire, and in the
maintenance of all those principles for which the
Empire stands.
No paper could do more and get time for
meals.

“Hamer”: “The day was wet and gloomv;
but the lights in the chancel shed a soft
radiance over the bridal party and the tall
palms which formed the main decoration.
On the altar were vases of white blooms.”
This is not from a Chas. Garbage novel,-
but is the way a very solemn Sydney daily
served up its account of a recent wedding.
The legend says that a man on that paper
who once dared to put some little life into a
news item —it was a long time ago—was
coldly informed that he was not on a comic
journal. But the old girl likes to put a
little powder on the inconspicuous places
nowadays.
PARADISE MISSED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
11l fifty years of life he had
Expended rather less
Than half a sov. on stoush debates,
The drama, picture shows and fetes;
For he was on the press
And entered “on the nod.” But still
He reckoned he was treated ill.
At length, his last assignment kept,
His final “gate” he made,
His “copy” spiked, and went. His job
A cub of promise snared. A “bob”
Per man was duly paid
To buy a wreath. And then they took
His name from off the Duty Book.
Old Scrawler, wafted upwards, found
Himself outside a gate
Near which a haloed spruiker cried:
“Come on, gents., stacks of room inside;
This way, now; don’t be late.”
Some sour-faced persons, pale and thin,
Displayed their checks and passed within.
From force of habit Scrawler turned
To make his way inside,
in aged, bewhiskered doorman stood
ind blocked him : “What ? The press ? No good 1
You’re barred up here,” he cried.
Then Scrawler put away his pipe.
“My man,” he said, “please don’t talk tripe.
“I think you scarcely understand
Exactly what it means
To fall out with the press. You know,
’Twill only serve to cruel your show—
The boys will give you ‘beans.’
But, still, I’d rather not be hard,
So take the Manager my card.”
The doorman shook his whiskers white,
And answered in a shout:
“We don’t care tuppence for your rag!
Now, do a bunk, and no more ‘mag,’
Or else the chucker-out
I’ll call.” So Scrawler went. Said he:
“All right, my man, just wait and see!”
He jumped upon the dummy of
A passing star, but knew
Not where exactly lie should go,
Until, attracted by a glow
Of crimson lights and blue,
He read: The Simon Sunday Blast,
And promptly through the doorway passed.
He got a job ; and now each day
Within his room he sits
And scribbles, in a frenzied glow,
Critiques anent the upstairs show,
In which-he gives it fits,
“The orchestra is solely string—
No wood or brass; the Chorus sing
“Now sharp, now flat, or tremolo”—
’Tis thus that Scrawler writes;
And how his soul is filled with glee
When to the Tophet Tivoli
The crowds adjourn o’ nights !
He thinks, what time his whole face glows:
“That other crowd will have to close 1”
Still, it would seem there’s room for both,
For both are open yet;
But Scrawler says that Paradise
Resorts to any “cronk” device
A decent house to get;
While it is due, he has no doubt,
To him that Hell is crowded out!

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs/’ and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, lever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S ‘FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

Saved by REXONA.
“About three weeks ago I had
the misfortune to have a pot of
boiling fat fall from the stove on
to my right shoulder, soaking
through my dress and burning
my back and arm something ter-
ribly. I was alone in the nouse
at the time witn a child, who
tore the blouse off me, and I was
not able to get to the hospital
until about noon. The doctor
told me tout if the burn had
occurred on my left side that the
shock would have killed me. I
went to the hospital every day
for a week to be treated, and they
wanted to graft skin over Ihe
burn, but, as the treatment did
not seem to help it in the
slightest, my husband told me not
to go there any longer, but to
go and get a pot of Rexona,
which I did. I went to Mr. Per-
cival’s store at llaroubra, and got
a pot from him, and from the
first application of Rexona i
obtained relief.
“I have used this constantly
for the past fortnight, and the
effect has been simply wonder-
ful. Several of the sores formed
scabs; the scabs have already
fallen off', while two of the very
severe sores have now formed
scabs and are likewise nearly
cured. My arm was swollen out to
four times its usual size, and the pain was something: terrible. I could not raise my
arm, and it was all 1 could do to gret about at all.
“Everyone who has seen the terrible way in which I have been burned think that
it is most wonderful the way Itexona has cured it, and I certainly think the cure
simply marvellous.
“Should anyone want to refer to me in respect to the matter, or the terrible wav
in which I was burned, I shall be pleased to tell them at any time, and give fun
particulars of how Itexona has cured me, for I feel very thankful for the cure, and
want everyone to know of the wonderful power Itexona has to heal terrible burns of
this nature.” (Signed) Mrs. It. WOODHEAD.
Mr. George Percival, General Merchant, Avoca Street, Ilandwiek, and
Maronbra, writes confirming the above Testimonial
“With reference to testimonial for Itexona Ointment sent by Mrs. Woodhead, of
Maroubra, I am very pleased to verify what she has said with reference to the
wonderful way the Ointment healed such a terrible scald.
“Airs. Woodhead had several pots of Ointment from my store at Afaroubra, and I
saw her occasionally during the course of the healing, and I think it most
wonderful.” Yours faithfully,

Lure of the Lotus.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN the wind blows fresh from the
eastward.
And the ships go out on the tide,
With the Peter blue at the masthead,
And a flutter of white at the side,
I turn to the dusty city
And try to forget the pain,
The hopeless, unresting whisper—•
“Come hack to the East again !”
I'm sick of the rush and the rattle,
The crowds, the dust and the din;
The faces blank as the houses,
That tell of the soul within;
Of talk that runs in a circle,
Of creeds that are no man’s creed ;
And a wisdom that lops the flower
To make more room for the weed.
-V thousand miles to the northward
The steady steamers trade,
Island to indolent island
Strung on a sea of jade;
Where the brown huts dream in the shadows,
And the crouching mangroves lean
To the still mysterious river
That slips their roots between.
Oh, mornings in old Macassar !
: Oh, seen through a golden mist,
Skies painted of rose and nacre
With a sea-floor of amethyst!
On jungle-belt and on rice-field
The long, white mist-wreaths lay,
And, frail and ghostly, the mountains
Soared inland, far away.
Oh, the pale blue smoke in the kampongs!
The tall plumed palms entwined
That whisper and talk together
With never a hint of a wind !
The high-pooped junks at their moorings!
The fishing-stakes by the shore !
And the brown, gold sails, three-cornered,
That the fishing-praTius bore!
Then the hum rose loud in the passar,
By the old. grey fortress wall,
Where the sentry smiled from the gateway
At the naked babies a-sprawl.
The carts creaked by with the driver
Perched high on his swaying lead.
And the patient buffaloes plastered
With the dust of the Tello road.
Oh, evenings in old Macassar!
Like a champak flower the moon
Turned the whole hushed sea to silver
Beyond the empty aloon.
And sharp through the* scented darkness
Of the still, hot Asian night.
Came the quick, clear click of the billiards
In the lamp-lit “Societeit.”
'Times, down where an archway opened,
We heard in the narrow street
The whine of a long-necked fiddle.
The rhythm of a tom-tom’s beat;
And saw by the yellow oil-flare
The shadowy puppets go,
Or a dancer bedecked, harsh-throated,
With subtle motions and slow.
Oh, the hot, green glooms of the jungle
The silences snapped or stirred
By the ci'ack of a rotten tree-branch.
The strange clear call of a bird ;
Where the sunlight drips through the clear-
ing
With its flicker of butterflies.
And, subtle and sweet and evil,
The scent of an orchid dies.
Brown stems where the grey moss festers,
And the still, grey water beneath,
Where life, like a harlot, kisses
The lips of her lover, Death.
Ihe motionless coil of a creeper
Suddenly seems to wake,
And the hidden soul of the forest
Looks out from the eyes of the snake.
The rune of running water,
The spell of the salt sea-wind,
Have woven a magic about me
The years will never unbind.
And whether night’s cup be purple,
r Or whether day’s cup be gold.
The wine of remembrance savors
A sorrow not to be told.
I have eaten too long of the lotus,
My heart is hot with desires
For the wet, warm smells of the jungle,
And the reek of the cooking fires ;
lor tlie laughter of lithe brown women
And the thud of the pounded grain—
Oh. out of the streets and the cities,
I would go to mine own again !

Knocking Around.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ISPHAT a week at Thargomindah.
where I also spent my last coin, and
then, hearing that cattle were coming
in from many western runs, I set out
along the stock route. At the first place I
honored with a call I tied my horses up in
a clump of bushes, as the squattage bore a
bad name among swagmen, and a traveller
with horses was regarded as a person of
means. I couldn’t afford to be suspected
just then of possessing even moderate wealth.
I was met by the manager’s wife, who
asked what I wanted. Her icy demeanor
repelled confidence. I inquired if I could
see the storekeeper. Her critical gaze rested
momentarily on the ration bags I held in my
hand.
“Where are your horses?” she inquired.
“I am walking, madam,” I said.
“I didn’t know footmen wore spurs!”
Her cold eyes were very searching as I
answered in my embarrassment: “They’re a
pair I picked un. I put them on—it was an
easy way to carry them.”
“Oh! And I suppose you picked up the
sweat-stains on the legs of your trousers
also?”
“They came with the pants,” I said des-
perately. “I swapped another pair for
them.”
“I see; and you swapped boots too?” she
said quietly, her eyes still searching me. “I
notice the heels are white with horse-sweat.”
1 had come to a dead end, and glanced
shamefacedly at my accusing heels. She
looked at me with frigid severity.
“You had better try the next station,
young man.”
I ignored the next station absolutely. I
had not yet recovered from the rebuff at the
last one. But farther on at an out-station
I was graciously supplied by a new-chum
storekeeper who was not the least concerned
about my method of locomotion. He re-
marked, as he scooped it out, that the flour
was not very good—which was probably the
reason he gave me so much of it. I dis-
covered, on baking the first damper, that it
was whiting—the stuff with which painters
and glaziers make putty and whitewash.
Possibly the station received it for flour. A
border souattage once ordered general stores,
principally tinned stuff, and three months
afterwards there arrived between 20 and
30 cases of monkey soap, nothing else. Again,
Warenda station, near Winton, once re-
ceived by mistake a ton of fruit salts and
two tons of shovels. Some people write such
a monotonous hand that it all looks like
monkey soap and shovels. I lowever, I met
a good-hearted carrier at Eurongella, and his
expert cookery removed the deleterious effects
of “travellers’ flour.”
When I had packed up again I asked him
the way to Tallyho, a caravansary which
displays its hospitable sign some miles west-
ward of Kyabra. The sunbrowned warrior
hitched up his pants, likewise his shirt-
sleeves, and squatting down on his heels,
diligently drew a line in the dust with a
stick. Then lie made a mark at one end.
“This is where we are,” he said, tapping
the mark impressively, as though he thought
there might be a suspicion in my mind that
we were somewhere else. “You go along
this track till you come to a turn-off —here
(draws a branch track) ; leave that, an’
keep straight across the creek (here he took
his pocket-knife and excavated a creek in
miniature) ; then you’ll see a hill on the
left (scoops up a heap of dust with both
hands) ; keep that on your right till you
come to a gate (breaks up some twigs
and builds a fence). A mile past that you’ll
see a big tree on one side (erects a small
branch), and a lot of bones on the other
side (builds a little pile of sticks to repre-
sent bones). There’s a road from there to a
tank (another excavation) ; you leave that,
and a bit farther on there’s another turn-off
(more tracing). Take the track round the
big rock (hunts round for a boulder, and
puts it in position), and run it right along
between two big hills.”
The unsatisfactory part of this bushman’s
map is that the traveller can’t take it with
him, and before he has gone far he has got.
the hills and rocks and bones all mixed, and
is as much in doubt as if he had never been
directed at all.
However, I reached Tallyho. The pub,
situated between Kyabra and Windorah, is
a western landmark. There was a crowd
here, and as the sun went down, reddening
over the plains of the Diamantina, I mingled
with it for companionship.
* * * #
Reports current at Tallyho concerning the
Diamantina country induced me next morn-
ing to retrace my steps as far as Kyabra. and
take the northern track. The same evening,
between Kyabra and Tliylungra, I camped
with an old man who was prospecting for
opal. He had some good specimens and a
pickle-bottle of “chips.”
“There’s a patch out ’ere somewheres,” he
said, “which would make me rich in next-to-
no-time if I could only strike it. I’ve seen
a bloke go out from Eurongella dead-broke,
an’ come back in a month with 70 or 80
quids’ worth of opal ; lias a good spree,
does it all in. an’ goes off again an’ gets
another lot. Gets fair on to it every time.
But hang me if I can ! We planned to fox
him once or twice. An’ do you know what
he does then? Jus’ pads it over to Paddy
Seanlan’s an’ gets a job o’ bullock-punchin’.
When no spies are about he chucks the whin
down an’ goes off’ opal-gougin’. ’F I had his
chance I’d make a pile an’ splash it up
down below somewheres. Wouldn’t catch me
wastin’ it in a forsaken hole like Euron-
gella.”
He lit liis pipe and commenced to make a
damper on the back of a discarded shirt.
He had a pudding of some sort boiling in a
tin. It was tied up in the leg of a pair of
moleskins, the superfluous part of which
hung over the side of the tin away from the
fire.
Reaching Tliylungra. I camped with a
young fellow named Sam Slingsbv. lie was
waiting for a mob of cattle that was to start
shortly for Naryilco. and after an interview
with the drover I decided to wait also.
The wait ran into two weeks, which was
spent in breaking-in a lot of uncivilised colts
for the track. A livelv six weeks with
equally uncivilised cattle followed, which left
me rich with £l4 in my pocket.
Leaving Naryilco, I was making my lone
way to Tibooburra, when I fell in with an
old miner named Jimmy Begory. He had
fossicked and puddled for years about Tiboo-
burra, and was going back to fossick and
puddle some more. There was no place like
Tibooburra. There was gold everywhere;
no man who went a-digging there could help
getting a good living—and he might get rich.
I was on the road to the land of plenty at
last. My mining experience being limited I
agreed to “go mates” with Jimmy. Then he
borrowed some money from me and got help-
lessly drunk at Johnny Rogan’s, a wayside
pub at the border gate.
He was a bit tottery on his legs next
morning, and carried a small bottle of
rum to keep the cold out. He was walk-
ing, but I carried his swag on my pack-
horse. The Twelve-mile bore pulled me up
that night. Jimmy turned off the road at
dusk to look for water. Following the bed
of Whittabranah Creek he fell over a bank
into a heap of sand, the softness of which
suggested a camp. A cold wind was blowing,
and Jimmy was neatly perished. Rooting
out a long hole, he stretched himself in it
and drew the sand over him, covering all
but his face. Towards daylight a lieavv
shower of rain higher up sent a volume of

PILES'
A Man’s Terrible Martyrdom—Suffering Always—
Life was a Misery—Other Remedies Prove Useless.
h
One of the greatest living
physicians, referring to piles,
says The pain is often so
intense that the patient feels
he can neither walk nor lie,
while in some cases the loss
of blood is so great as to con-
stitute a grave danger
The way in which piles yield to Zam-Buk
is nothing short of remarkable. The con-
centrated and carefully combined ingredi-
ents of which Zamrßuk is composed take
away the inflammation; and the pain and irrita-
tion, which at times almost amounts to agony,
is relieved the moment the healing balm is
applied.
Confirmation of this statement is furnished by Mr. J.
Abood, of Albion Street, Warwick, Q., who says:—
“Three years ago I suffered all the agony incidental to
piles. At times I would pass nearly half a cupful of blood,
and became so distressed that life was perfect misery. I
suffered all the time when either standing or lying down. I
tried all sorts of ways and means in my endeavor to rid
myself of this miserable complaint, but the many so-called
remedies I used proved fruitless. At last I thought I would
give Zam-Buk a trial, and from the very first application of
the balm I derived relief. The burning inflammation
gradually subsided and the terrible pains were subdued,
and ten days after the first applications of Zam-Buk I was
completely cured of the piles. I feel convinced I had as bad

an attack of piles as any of my acquaintances, some of whom were
troubled for years, and they were astonished at the speedy cure Zam-
Bulc had effected in tny case.
“ I cannot speak, too highly in favor of this wonderful balm, and
will never be without a pot. It is now three years since Zam-Buk
brought me ease and comfort, in place of torture and distress, and as I
have not had the slightest symptoms of piles since, I feel quite satis-

Anaemia
Frequently Unrecognised
The Importance of its Detection
The Symptoms of Anaemia (Poorness
of Blood) are Difficulty of Breathing, Lack of
Energy, Depression, Pallor, and Exhaustion after
Slight Exertion. Many people fail to recognise
these symptoms of Anaemia— the disease creeps
on, obtains a firm grip of the system and eventually
becomes chronic. If the symptoms are recognised
at the beginning it is a very simple matter to enrich
the blood and so effectually check the disease.
Iron Jefloidsi
enrich the blood—renew vitality
After taking IROM ‘JELLOIDS,’ the blood becomes
enriched and strengthened, the distressing symptoms of
Anaemia quickly disappear, giving place to a state of
vigorous health and buoyant spirits.
DR. ANDREW WILSON wrote '“ It can be definitely stated
“ that Iron ‘ Jelloids ’ constitute the most effective and desirable
“ treatment for Anaemia or Poorness of Blood.”

Avater doAvn the anabranches. It crept
silently on to Jimmy, and rolled and hissed
over him. He Avas the most startled crea-
ture on Whittabranah Greek that morning.
Reaching Tibooburra avc took possession
of a deserted canvas hut, which, having a
stone fireplace, Avas ’ snug through the cold
Avinter nights. For a Aveek Ave did nothing
but wa.lk about, taking observations and rub-
bing shoulders Avith scarred ancients who
had spent half a lifetime there. They gath-
ered in the bars at night, and one Avould tell
the other hoAv many loads he put through,
and the “Aveiglits” it Avent to the load. Old
Peter Hardy told the company that Mrs.
Edwards found a speck at Nuggetty. where-
upon the company anticipated marvellous
finds at Nuggetty “one of these days.’’ Then
Tom Evans remarked that Peter McLachlan
got a grain to one dish at Bullocky Gully,
Avherefore Nuggetty sank into insignificance.
They would speck and puddle and drybloAV
till midnight; then totter home across the
gibbers, calculating hoAA r many grains they
had passed over the bar at Loucy Robin-
son’s.
The field Avas a geological puzzle. The
“color” could be got in the street, in the
backyards—anywhere. The first man I met
as I entered the toAvn Avas Dad Walters,
avlio Avas standing in the middle of the street
by the side of Sirs. Fahey’s hotel, Avith a
heap of SAvept-up dirt in front of him, dry-
blowing Avith tAvo dishes and obstructing the
traffic. There Avas gold all over the locality ;
yet, being in “made ground,” nobody kneAV
Avhere it came from. Round the town were
cone-shaped piles of gibbers, and rugged hills
of sandstone, broken slate and granite. Some
thought the whole had been erupted; others,
that it Avas the centre of rapid whirlpools in
prehistoric times. Buried on the flats were
the beds of olden creeks, and deep down some-
Avhere, it Avas supposed, was the bed of a river
carrying a Avealtli of gold surpassing the
dreams of avarice. I questioned Murphy,
the tracker, but he had no ancestral record
of anything of that kind.
Contiguous to Tibooburra is the Avell-
kuoAvn Mount Browne, a mining “rush” in
the Grey Range, called after Dr. John
Browne, who accompanied Sturt, the ex-
plorer, in IS-I 4; and nine miles from Mount
Browne is Depot Glen, iioav known as Mount
Poole. There Sturt’s party rested through
that terrible summer of heat and drought;
and remains of the boat with which he was
to haA r e sailed over Central Australia —then
supposed to be a great inland sea—were long
preserved. The “sea” is known as Sturt’s
Stony Desert —a misnomer.
In this interesting locality old Jimmy and
I went to Avork. I was enthusiastic. Gold-
digging had always fascinated me. As
Jimmy said, you might at any moment drop
on to a fortune. On the other hand, Avhich
Jimmy didn’t mention, you might work close
round one for a decade and not strike it.
Jimmy had no money or tools; but then he
had been some time aAvay from this pros-
perous spot. I had, therefore, to buy an
outfit, Avliich consisted of a cask —cut in two
for tubs —-a short- and a long-handled shovel,
a sinking and a driving pick, and tAvo kero-
sene tins. We borrowed a cradle from a
fossicker Avho was having a wet holiday, and
Avere ready. First we prospected the gul-
lies and flats, carrying the dirt, sometimes
three miles, in our handkerchiefs to water.
We tried “Easter Monday,” a. cement hill
that was impossible Avithout a dry-blower.
We tried “Bullocky,” “Snapper’s Point,”
“Good Friday” and “Ash Wednesday,” but
didn’t find anything A-ahialde, barring a
hobble chain.
Finally Ave struck a patch near Tommy
Iloon’s garden—Avhere vegetables Avere handy.
We christened the claim “Next Week.” The
dribble of gold Ave got always seemed to
promise a pocket next Aveek or thereabouts.
But Ave were unlucky with our soakages.
We sank seven before we struck water. Then
Ave got only an hour’s supply, Avhich took
tAvo hours to make. Thus Ave could only
puddle one hour out of three, or three hours
a day.
We worked hard for a fortnight. Then
Ave cleaned up, took our gold to Corn-
thAvaite’s store and Aveighed it, and found
Ave had I2s. worth. Meantime the man
Avho lent us the cradle jumped our claim,
and swore he had never lent us the jiggin’
concern at all.
I sold my kit next day to Dad Walters for
half what it cost, and gave up mining. The
shearing season was just beginning, and a
job of wool-rolling at Whittabranah led
to a continued period of activity there, and
subsequently at Oonnulpie Downs, in the
capacity of “handy man.”
The “handy man” Avas one whose services
were called for in every emergency. He Avas a
combination of shearer, musterer, carpenter,
painter, tinsmith, Avheelwright, bookkeeper,
gardener, blacksmith, engine-driver, groom,
coachman, paperhanger, horse- and bullock-
driver. In slack times he was sent out to
repair fences, scoop silt out of tanks, drive
a poison cart, trap rabbits, ride paddocks and
pull out bogged sheep. On wet days he re-
paired damaged furniture, made Avaterbags,
half-soled the “house” boots, or did a little
cabinet Avork. He also cut the boss’s hair,
killed a sheep uoav and again, and helped to
shoe horses.
When the old engine got out of order,
which Avas pretty often, he was expected to
find out what Avas amiss and put it right;
the squattage depended on his ability also
Avhen the pumping gear broke doAvn at a time
Avhen it was urgently needed for watering
perishing sheep. Going a hundred feet doAvn
a dripping and indifferently-slabbed Avell,
and working for hours at a stretch, SAAunging
on a narrow board at the end of a Avire rope,
with a dim candle for light, Avas not pleasant
work at night. In drought time he joined
the other hands in trying to keep old cavcs
from dying, and seeing them die in spite of
everything. . ,
Our field of operations Avas on the wide
Avestern plains Avhere the drought falls heavi-
est on the sheep man. There everyone was
used to arid conditions, but still the long
summer brought anxiety, and often isolation.
We had been cut off from the inside regions
for monilis. The mail coach still battled
through to Tibooburra, and for Aveeks at a
stretch it comprised the whole of the traffic
on the sun-baked road that led to Broken
Hill and the Darling River. No teams
AA-ei-e moving up or dowu, only a camel train
at long intervals, and this kept strictly to one
route, the nearest point of which was 40
miles away. Jam and butter were luxuries.
>So were vegetables. Even the wild plants
had failed us. The water in the excavated
tanks and holes that still held out was either
muddy, greenish, or thick with insects. To
clear this we used copi, gathered on the
stony hills. Anything that was at all
drinkable was welcome.
There were no regular hours of work.
Sometimes we worked in the day, sometimes
at night; and occasionally both day and
night. As the water on the run dried up
the holes had to be watched. Flocks came
in to drink at sundown or in the night, so
that it was often necessary to camp by the
watering places to prevent the weak animals
from smothering, and pull out the scores that
got hogged. Some of the holes, when they
became too boggy, were fenced off with wire-
netting. Sheep gathered there all the same,
and had to be taken regularly to other
watering places—eventually to troughs at a
deep well, where pumping was continued day
and night.
In daytime the water in the troughs was
lukewarm. Sheep drank it in the effort to
quench their thirst, until they were dis-
tended like miniature balloons, and were un-
able to waddle away. Hundreds lay about
in the sun. or crowded round each little bush
and tree, until the day began to cool. Those
that started back to the pastures immedi-
ately were thirsty again by the time they
got there.
So it became necessary to work them in at
night, or early in the morninsr. Flocks that
had regularly watered at the troughs came
in soon after sundown, and returned at once
to their feeding-grounds. But those that
had been used to watering elsewhere gathered
at the dried-up holes and had to be brought
in. We rode out at night, carrying rugs
and a waterbag. Alongside a boghole we
camped, making a tire on the bank and
spreading our rugs under the shelter of a
thick bush. All night the sheep bleated
round us; now and again fresh mobs came
in, breaking through the flimsy barrier
and sweeping into the bog. Then we had
to drive them off, and pull out the smothering
heap that lay packed in the mud.
Dead sheep on the run had to be skinned.
The pelts were hung on fences and bushes,
to be gathered up later in a cart. This
was the most unpleasant part of the
drought work, for the carcases became
putrid in a few hours.
The position grew rapidly worse, and
finally we had to look elsewhere for feed
and water. Horses from various places
were sent into Queensland. A mob belong-
ing to 50 different owners, who each con-
tributed a small sum weekly to defray
expenses, were started on the road in charge
ot two men. They were travelled from
place to place, mainly subsisting on what
they could get along the stock routes and
on the commons. The men loitered wher-
ever they were permitted on favored runs,
keeping the animals alive and killing time
until they could return. They wandered in
this way for seven months.
Flocks were converging on Tinaroo Bore,
for which place we also headed with a big
mob. We travelled early in the morning
and late in the evening, sometimes till late
at night, spelling through the hottest hours
of the day. Even then we had some stages
that took a lot of trouble to get over. We
were accompanied by a blackfellow in a.
waggonette, in which several oil drums of
water were carried. This was to revive the
drooping animals at the tail of the mob
when we had an extra stretch of waterless
country to cross. The water was poured
down their throats with a pannikin. They
straggled on to camp usually hours after
the rest of the mob, one man’s time being
wholly occupied in dodging them along and
giving them refreshments. A few had to
be carried in the waggonette. These were
penned separately, and feed was cut for
them, where it was possible to get any, to
strengthen them for the next day’s journey.
By this slow, laborious method we
reached Tinaroo, which presented the
appearance of a little calico township. The
wide area around was all open country.
Small canals carried water from the bore
over a good part of it; and along some of
these canals reeds and rushes grew, and
here and there were Spools -where now and
again a duck could be got. Feed was not
luxuriant, but there was enough to tide the
refugees over a few months. Besides stand-
ing feed, there was loose dry grass lying
about which sheep and horses greedily
licked up.
Around the bore were many camps;
travellers spelling or weather-bound:
shearers camping for the benefit of their
horses; men and boys with sheep and
cattle. Tents were scattered over a con-
siderable distance, it being easier to carry
water for camp use than to carry wood.
At night they were picked out by little
fires that blazed brightly for a couple of
hours. When you Avent to them you found
other fires that were not visible in the dis-
tance, little smoky fires that, smouldered
alongside each man’s head to keep away
mosquitoes.
The chief entertainer of the camp Avas a
bush poet, a tall, soldierly man Avith a soft
voice and a long, Avhite beard. He wrote
doggerel on every insignificant thing that
happened in the vicinity. If one lost track
of his flock through falling asleep under a
tree, or fell into the canal Avhen going home
at night, or got permanently separated from
his only hat in a dust storm, the incident
was commemorated in \ r erse. The swag-
man who lost his dog Avas the theme of an
epic. The poet wrote while shepherding his
flock through the day, and at night he read
liis compositions to anyone avlio would listen.
If it appeared to be an appreciative ear he
spent the whole ermning in droning rhymes
into it.
Dingoes Avero plentiful, their, howls
breaking anon through the night on the
weird silence of the plains. They came
around Avhen the fires AVere low, and occa-
sionally one made a raid on the camping
sheep. The sudden disturbance brought the
shepherd flying out in half-dress uniform.
Sometimes the hurdles were knocked down,
and there was a stampede that kept him
rushing about for an hour or so. He
grumbled incessantly; but in a region Avhere
life Avas generally dull, such exciting little
incidents Avere spice to the rest of the camp.
