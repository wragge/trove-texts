IN “TYRONE AMONG THE BUSHES” STANDS ONCE-PROUD BENBURB
nrHE name “Tyrone” in Irish means “the Land of Owen,” and
the Owen, of course, was that almost mythical Owen O’Neill
who founded what was to become perhaps the greatest name in
Irish history. It was a later O’Neill, the sixteenth-century Shane,
who built his castle at Benburb, down in the south of Tyrone, and
it was to this ancient castle that he returned after his famous visit
to Queen Elizabeth, when he and his shaggy saffron-kilted men
were the talk of London for weeks. After the Plantation came Sir
Richard Wingfield, later Lord Powerscourt, who built on the Proud
Peak of Benburb the fortified mansion, pictured above, perched
high on its rock above the tumbling loveliness of the Blackwater
River. In Ireland’s' ancient history Benburb is identified with what
was called Portrigh, the Landing Place of the King, mentioned in
the “Annals of the Masters” as the place where a high king of
Ireland was slain by a king of Ulster in the year 365. In modern
times Benburb has become the centre from which the country’s
finest anglixjg may be enjoyed. The nearby Blackwater River has
a magnificent series of pools and waterfalls, and to them after the
August floods come the celebrated Lough Neagh dollaghan, a trout
that weighs anything frbm five to twelve pounds, *

THOMAS MANN'S ESSAYS.
When on his eightieth birthday Sig-
mund Freud listened to Thomas Mann's
oration at a gathering in his honor at
Vienna it is possible that he .was gratified.
On the other hand, it is possible that he
boiled. It would depend on whether or
not the father of psychoanalysis thought
of pysychoanalysing the man who was
praising him.
The oration is printed in Mann’s
Essays of Three Decades (Seeker and
Warburg), and it reminds ope very much
of Mark Antony’s praise of Brutus.
Freud is, says Mann in effect, “an honor-
able man” ; but, he is prompt to add, not
so learned in literature as he might be;
Actually we know that Sigmund Freud,
that mighty spirit in whose honor we are
gathered together, founder of psychoanalysis
as a general method of research and as a
therapeutic technique, trod the steep path
alone and independently, as physician and
natural scientist, without knowing that re-
inforcement and encouragement lay to his
hand in literature.
He did not know Nietzsche, scattered
throughout whose pages one finds premoni-
tory flashes of truly Freudian insight; he
did not know Novalis, whose romantic-
biologic fantasies so often approach
astonishingly close to analytic conceptions;
he did not know Kierkegaard, whom he
must have found profoundly sympathetic
and, finally, he did not know Schopen-
hauer, the melancholy symphonist of a
philosophy of the instinct, groping for
change and redemption.
If he was not lulled into a trance by
the festivity of the occasion and the com-
pliments accompanying this not alto-
gether flattering recital,* Freud may well
have suspected that Thomas' Mann did
not love him as well as he professed;
or, rather, that the oration was exhibiting
some unease, if not hostility, at a medical
man’s intrusion into the territories of art
and philosophy. A. little later in the
speech Mann frankly attacks Freud for
his contemptuous treatment of the philo-
sophers!, while a paragraph that seems on
the surface to relate to Fascism and Com-
munism may also be read as an attack
on all that cruel, bloody and incoherent
art which in both literature and painting
sprang—though not with Freud’s blessing
—from the Freudian approach to life:
This is a situation which, in the historical
experience of our own day, can , take the
upper hand with the ego, with a whole
mass-ego, thanks to a moral devastation
which is produced by worship of the un-
conscious, the glorification of its dynamic
as the only life-promoting force, the sys-
tematic glorification of the primitive and
irrational. For the unconscious, the id
is primitive and irrational, is pure dynamic.
It knows no values, no good or evil, no
morality.
With these thoughts in his mind, and
with his belief, somewhat tactlessly stated,
that he himself had anticipated in his
Joseph novels the Freudian theory of be-
havior, Thomas Mann might well have
concluded his speech with an attack on
the guest-of-honor—an attack from the
literary viewpoint, and modified, of
course, by respect for Freud as a scientist.
Instead of that, the oration ends with a
. hope that Freud will be
honored as the path-finder towards a
humanism of the future, which we dimly
divine and which will have experienced
much that the earlier humanism knew not
of. It will be a.humanism standing in a
different relation to the powers of the
lower world, the unconscious, the id: a
relation bolder, freer, blither, productive
of a riper art than any possible in our
neurotic, fear-ridden, hate-ridden world
The free folk are the people of a future
freed from fear and hate, and ripe for
peace.
These are elegant aspirations; and,
since Freudian analysis is *a contribution
to truth, one cannot deny that it may
have a beneficial effect on both art and
politics. But, on his own showing,
Thomas Mann is aware that the imme-
diate effect of Freud on the arts has been
that “devastation which is produced by a
worship of the unconscious” ; he is aware
that Freud discovered nothing that has
not been known to art and philosophy
since the Greeks ; and he must also be
aware that few phildsophers have changed
the world—except, temporarily, for the
worse. Ideas make men mad ; art pre-,
serves the balance of sanity.
The oration on Freud, then, is con-
fused ; it is essentially, or finally, poli-
tical in tone; and, when the address be-
comes political, clear thinking gives way
to unrealistic aspirations. It is a speech
made for a public occasion, in which
criticism is tempered by tact and some-
times smothered in timely sentiments.
When one adds that, because it is poli-
tical and polite, it is also rather dull, it
may be taken as typical of the faults of
the book as a whole.
If any writer ever had an excuse for
turning to politics it is Thomas Mann,
forced by his integrity into quitting his
native Germany. That he has been able
to continue writing novels in the last 10
years and that these, the delightful Lotte
in Weimar and The Transposed Heads,
have been altogether free from the taint
of political sermonising, is a magnificent
demonstration of the pride and independ-
ence of the artist. Excursions into politics
in the Essays of Three Decades, even if
one disagrees with the authors Socialism
and regards it as likely to lead to the very
imprisonment of the spirit Thomas Mann
most detests, are understandable, perhaps
admirable. But one must approach the
book, much as one approaches Charles
Morgan’s essays, with the understanding
that what looks like a work of literature
is frequently a work on politics ; and that
the politics, removed from their original
time and place, when they would have
been sensational, are not more interesting
than the average leading article in a daily
newspaper.
This leads to some special disappoint-
ments. One looks to Thomas Mann;
being a German, for enlightenment as to
the particular qualities the nation has
found in its great works of literature —
qualities which may not always be
apparent to an English reader —and too
often the essayist fails to draw attention
to anything more profound than the
obvious political morals. Crowded as
they are with lively biographical material,
and lit with the magical power and clarity
of some of the master’s sayings—“The
final effect of true art is the feeling of
charm,” for instance —the four essays on
Goethe do not add as much as one would
hope to the understanding and apprecia-
tion of Faust; while an essay on the
Laokoon and Nathan der WeiSe of Les-
sing does nothing to correct that impres-
sion of an immense and ponderous dull-
ness which those peculiar masterpieces
leave in the memory.
Fortunately, in roughly half the book,
Thomas Mann rises above politics into
art. His essay on Kleist’s Amphitryon
begins with the statement that he has
“loved” the play all his life, and it is jn
the spirit of love, with enthusiasm and
with gaiety, that he writes about it.
Here, benevolently assuming that “I were
the only person who had ever read it or
talked about it,” Thomas Mann does per-
form the invaluable service of introducing
to foreign readers a native classic —a
work rarely performed even in Germany,
he says—and of expounding its virtues
with such lucidity and such warmth that
the reader of the essay must at once wish
to read the play; more, if a satisfactory
translation can be found (the translations
throughout Essays of Three Decades are
poor), to see it tried out by one of the
Australian little theatres.
Derived from Molibre, but with
qualities of its own, Amphitryon, as
Mann expounds it, sounds an enchanting
piece of work, as remote from the heavi-
ness of Lessing as is Mann’s own The
Transposed Heads. It is a wild romantic
comedy, infusing new life into a legend
of the Greeks, in which the playwright
wrjngs every possible drop of drama,
humor and sensibility from a descent to
earth of Jupiter and Hermes: Jupiter in-
dulging in one of his customary amorous
enterprises by assuming the form of
Amphitryon, a gentleman away at the
wars, and spending a night with Alcmene,
Amphitryon’s wife; and Hermes assist-
ing his master by entering into the person-
ality of Amphitryon’s addlepated servant
Sosias.
Alcmene’s perplexities when her hus-
band returns next day are dealt with on
a high level of drama—
Impossible to analyse in words the charm
and depth of the situation, the intellectual
heights and anguished emotional stresses
of this lofty dialogue The whole scene
is shot through with illusions daring and
reverent at once, which play upon it in ah
unearthly transcendent light
and the comedy comes from the be-
wildered Sosias, never quite sure whether
he is himself or Hermes. In the mingling
of ancient Greece with the Germany of
Kleist’s own time, and in its consequent
blend of romantic drama with peasant
humor, high comedy mixed with low,
the piece has a Shakspearean ring to it,
and what Thomas Mann writes about
Sosias might just as well have been said
about Falstaff, or the Drunken Porter, or
Sir Toby Belch, or Caliban, or Autolycus:
But first comes the parody, the slap-
stick: a lively translation into the vulgar
and the farcical of all the high sobriety and
lofty feeling that have gone before. It is
the creative impulse mocking itself, it is
in so coarse a key that one asks oneself:
what kind of people are these poets, what
is their fire, their frosty flame, in what
sort of vicious, half-human relation do
they stand to life and feeling, that they
seek to intensify, heighten, illume, that
they cram with brilliance, with all their
arts and their passionate pains—and then,
as though they were utterly callous, as
though they possessed not a jot of all this
that they had just taken pains to show
with such triumphant passion that they
really had at heart; to make a long satyr
nose at it and at us and at all their
high-flown inspirations? V
The extraordinary thing about Essays
of Three Decades is that approving
Kleist’s tumultuous drama of the pas-
sions, and understanding that its mingling
of high and low bears witness to a mind
of the Shakspearean calibre that can en-
compass and affirm both earth and heaven,
Thomas Mann should say elsewhere, per-
haps thinking of T. S. Eliot, and appar-
ently with equal approval, “1/believe that
the secret longing and ultimate ambition
of all theatre is to return to the bosom
of the ritual out of, which —in both the
pagan and the Christian world —it
sprang”: a statement which needs con-
siderably more documentation than Mann
gives it and which, if approved and put
into practice, would lead to the reverse
of the Shakspearean view of life and of
the theatre.
But that statement is at least not poli-
tical, but thoughtful and provocative,
and, coming in an essay on Wagner,
essentially an artistic criticism. And the
Wagner essay is magnificent. What
Thomas Mann does in a small way with
Kleist —a criticism and a reanimation of
one play—he does, again on the grand
scale with the whole Wagnerian cycle
for his theme.
Even when he is writing laboriously, as
in an essay on Cervantes, or merely poli J
tically as in some of the passages on
Goethe and Tolstoi, Thomas Mann —
himself of no mean stature as a novelist
—shows that he is sympathetically at-
tracted" to the giants of European litera-
ture and that he can handle them cap-
ably ; and when he is inspired by artistic
passion for them, as with Kleist and
Wagner, his writing becomes rich and
fiery. His interest, adding at all times to
the human appeal of his essays, is in the
man as well as in the work and, to return
to Goethe, it is worth enduring 20 pages
of politics to come across the paragraph:
But iff his otvn country Goethe [in old
age] is rather like a famous fossil: an
honor, yet something of a burden to have
within its walls. Survivors who had known
him earlier very likely told their children
that he was a “wicked old man.” Wicked
because old and powerful at the same time
—a great old man must always be an
oppressive thing. There was a great relief
at the death of Frederick the Great. And
one is reminded of Napoleon’s question to
ohe of his marshals as to what the world
would say of him after his death. The
man launched into a solemn lament which
he said humanity would raise, but Napoleon
cut him short with the words: “Nonsense!
They’ll say ‘Ouf!’”
Having read right through this
enormous and learned tome of Thomas
Mann’s the reader also may be tempted
to say “Ouf!” Yet it is a good book;
even, because of a kind of sombre
grandeur, lit with passages of delight, out-
standing. Works of this stature are not
published every day; and when they are
they should be bought and read. Those
who have patience and leisure and a
liking for talk about great literature and
philosophy and music will find the pains
worth while.
New Magazines.
Australian and New Zealand writers
of verse and criticism who are inter-
ested in placing their work overseas
might note the name of Lionel Monteith
and his address, 155 Croxted-road, West
Dulwich, London, S.E. 21. Mr. Monteith
has founded a magazine to be called
“Poetry Commonwealth,” which will pub-
lish the work of Empire poets. He writes
to The Bulletin:
The first number will be a very small
affair, all poetry, and probably limited
to an edition of about' 1000. But it will
contain work by leading poets in Canada
and South Africa and, if promises
materialise, New Zealand also. It is
important, I feel, that the work from
these countries should be of the highest
standard, as it will be construed here as
being representative. Whilst “virgin” MSS-
is preferable, I am keeping the magazine
open for work which has appeared in
“little reviews” overseas provided that it
has not appeared in book form, nor in
any form in the U.K.
As soon as the magazine has been
launched I shall intensify my present
preliminary work on a Commonwealth
Anthology. A further, and separate,
development is the founding of a “Com-
monwealth Literary Clearing House”
(Howard Sergeant and I are doing this
jointly) through which we shall place
Australian and other Commonwealth work
in U.K. literary journals. We have just
made a start by placing an article by T.
Inglis Moore on Kenneth * Slcssor, sent by
Dal Stivens, in the “Poetry, Review,” but
that side of the thing must remain ex-
tremely limited for the present.
The price of the magazine (Australian
money) will be eight shillings for four
, issues, two shillings for v a single issue.
The price paid to contributors will, alas,
be nil. Mr. Monteith, like all editors of
new magazines, hopes to be able to pay
when the venture gets on its feet.
“Poetry Commonwealth” should, never-
theless, be worth supporting. It is the
first sign of English interest in Aus-
trslijm worlc for mjitiv vmonrl tvhH-
ff alian lor man y y ear , s > ancl . P U , b
hcation in the magazine could possibly be
a step towards what has been long over-
due—the publication in England in book
form of the best Australian poetry. As
. ,
an indication of Mr. Monteith s standards,
letter shows a particular interest in the
woric of Robert D. Fitz Gerald, Judith
Wright, Kenneth Slessor and people
writing on that level.”
Another comparatively new magazine,
now in its fourth issue, is “Landfall: a
New Zealand Quarterly,” edited by
Charles Brasch and published by the
Caxton Press, Christchurch. In the earlier
numbers its brow seemed a little high and
criticism—FitzGerald’s “Essay on
Me .. was described as a , poan ta
verse-inclined to levity .The fourth
number contains some dreadful reproduc-
tions of primitive paintings, but, taken as
whole f ; £ substantial and inter-
mkgazine, and beautifully printed,

Penguins’ and ‘Angry Penguins Broad-
sheet’ are no more, ‘Barjai’ has not been
heard of for some time, ‘Poetry’ appears
irregularly, and ‘A Comment’ [in need of,

cation.” When Flexmore Hudson’s
“Poetry” does appear, it might have been
added, it usually contains a poem or two
worth reading: Judith Wright’s and W.
Hart-Smith’s contributions, for instance,
in the September, 1947, issue; in which

Furphy’s novel is about nine-tenths ideas,
whereas Tom Jones'is— in Fielding’s brief
and a musing sermonisings at the begin-
n j ng Q f each book—not more than one-
tenth ideas. And that is one reason why
j om Jones is nine times as good a novel
as Rigby’s Romance .
Prize for Poetry.
The 1947 Grace Leven Prize for
poetry has been awarded to Pacific Sea,
by Nan McDonald. This is the first
time the award has been made. The
judge was Mr. R. G. Howarth.
The prize (£5O) was left by William
Baylebridge, to be awarded annually in
January for the best volume of poetry
published in the preceding 12 months,
by a writer either Australian-born and
writing as an Australian, or naturalised
in Australia and resident in Australia for
not less than 10 years.
Some other conditions are that the
award shall not be made in two con-
secutive years to the same competitor,
and no competitor shall be eligible to
receive more than three awards; and
that, “since a gift to a young man is
more likely, in the nature of things, to
benefit the cause of literature than such
a gift to one advanced in years, this
fact shall duly (but not unduly) be taken
into account when determining the
award.” When certain contingencies are
fulfilled the prize is to be increased to
£lOO annually.
Cottage and Garden in Australia'
Edna Walling (Oxford University Press;
Angus and Robertson). “It has been
written,” says the - author, “for those
hahnted by the dream of a cottage in the
country” ; and it is, consequently, a kino
of beautiful nightmare. It tells how to
build your own cottage, with some in-
structions on pisd and cob, discusses
furnishing and the garden; a practical
book, economically written and attrac-
tively illustrated.

Information Sought.
When should native flora be
pruned? What manures are most
suitable and when should they be
applied ?
Prune native plants after the flower-
ing is over. Cut bottlebrush limbs
off behind the spent flower-heads, and
shorten the limbs on Christmas bush,
Geraldton wax, boronias and waratahs
to force new growth for next year’s
flowering. Leaf-mould and sand are
most natural helps to native flora,
but a little rotted manure spread over
the soil at the base of the stems and
watered in is not injurious. Avoid
strong fertilisers and also fowl- and
sheep-manure.
* * * *
How should clematis be propa-
gated ?
Layering is the surest method of
propagating clematis. Bend low-
growing limbs to the ground (or use
boxes of soil on stands), make a slit
in the limb where the elbow eaters
the soil and fasten the limb down
with bent wire or a long iron staple;
finally cover with at least 4in. of
soil pressed down hard. To heavy
soil add a helping of sand and keep
the elbow well watered. In about
three months sever the limb from
the parent plant; transplanting should
be left until the young plants are
six months old.

Characteristics of the boxfisk?
The head and body of this fish,
which is plentiful in Australian waters,
are encased in a hard, bony covering,
leaving only the fins free. Most of
the species are highly ornate, with
amazingly brilliant colors and pat-
terns. They are also known as coffin
or trunk fishes. A common tropical
representative is called cowfish, on
account of two long spines that pro-
ject forward from the forehead like
a pair of horns.
* * * *
During a cricket match the ball was
hit and lost. The batsman had run
seven when thet fieldsman called “lost
ball.” How many runs should be
allowed ?
Seven runs must be credited to
the batsman. Law 34 states: “If a
ball in play cannot be found or re-
covered any fieldsman may call ‘Lost
ball,’ when the ball shall be ‘dead’;
six runs shall be added to the score,
but if more than six runs have been
run before ‘lost ball’ has been called,
as many runs as have been run shall
be scored.” It is not the duty of
the umpire to call “lost ball”; that
can only be done by a fieldsman.

HERE ARE THE ANSWERS:
1. Underinflation of tyres adds to
the risk of the road. This driver
is carelessly risking his own life and
the lives of others because of slack
tyres.
2. Vision only partial with insuf-
ficient windscreen wiper which does
not traverse full arc. Failure to
maintain wipers in working order is
responsible for large number of
accidents.
3. This driver is obviously headed
for trouble. Crossing the double
line is a frequent cause of road
smashes.
4- Here is the sensible driver. Pulls well off
the side of the road to change a tyre. Out of
the line of the passing traffic, he can do the job
faster and with greater safety.
DEATH IS SO PERMANENT
Inserted by the Australian Road Safety Council.
c\S
Put yourself in this driver’s
place. You would want to
prove that you did every-
thing possible to prevent the
accident. A little extra care
with your driving and with
your car may help to save
you from a serious charge
—it may even save your life.

A GAME In the PARK
By Cecil mann
BY their signs shall ye know them;
the peaceful little Park by its
grassed acres and its still trees and
the walled bay full of moored white
boats; and, making a handy map refer-
ence or landmark to it, the Stadium
opposite across the road: a flat
architectural wonder of bricks and old
iron stuck together with talkie posters,
and for its sign the two boxers silhou-
etted on the roof-edge above the entrance,
crouched in their eternal pose of con-
flict.
A fair sense of humor to have arranged
things like that in the first place; the
hairline human comedy of peace and
war as such next-door neighbors. With
good enough warrant, too, for the signs
of both of them. So much of sunshine
and friendly games and all that on the
one hand, and on the other, in below
past that pair of beauties shaping up for
fight, in there for the crowded, howling
tiers from ringside up to bleachers under
the maze of smoked rafters, enough of
fierce fight and frantic uproar to make
even the pair over the entrance outside
spring into action.
And here, at any rate, the two elements
of our ancient comedy, with those signs
they both wear, kept separate by that
good straight road between them. So
long as the council men, gloomily digging
at the road through the week, don’t up
with it while nobody’s looking and take
it away. A thought which well deserves
spurning with the label: Enter Fantasy,
clad in Nonsense.
ANYWAY, the council men are not
there on a Sunday morning, when
peace in the Park is complete and only
the two sparring above the entrance hold
the fort across the road. The Park, in
midsummer, is a spreading out and an
uplifting of all shades of green in the
sparkling sunshine: the part-clipped
fresh grass, covering the bare patches
made in the open spaces by the winter
football, and calling now for cricket;
the dark big Moreton Bay fig-trees in a
massed wall along the side at the road;
the pale spreading plane-trees in their
gossip groups, and the spindly poplars
lining in a row along the white-railed
stormwater channel —once a wild little
stream with fish in it —its straight course
now cutting the Park in two and empty-
ing under its white yard or so of bridge
into the bay. And over it all the blue
summer sky; the brilliant sun; a stray
float or two of clean white cloud.
There it all is, like a sunny landscape
painting of itself; another of its right
symbols for a Sunday morning the lone
church-bell heard faintly from a long
way off. Thus it all is as the two cricket
teams arrive together on the one tram
from the city: twenty-two of them —
twenty players, as their spotless flannels
proclaim ; the other two, dressed as if
they were on their way to play bowls,
obviously the umpires.
The count of twenty represents an irri-
tating disappointment to both sides ; one
member of each having failed in his
duty—perhaps too weighty a word for
this purely friendly encounter between
the cricket clubs of two purely friendly,
if rival, business houses. They fan
out over the grass towards the centre of
the Park corner booked for the game;
the umpires walking thoughtfully, with
hands clasped behind their backs, in the
correct Scott-and-Borwick manner, and
the players tossing the ball about from
one to another.
In their immaculate outfits they all
look as if they had been turned out by
the one Maker from one mould; fitting
perfectly into the Park’s peaceful setting ;
belonging there with its leafy trees, its
low-cooing doves, its sunbright stillness.
They make part of it all.
Arrived at the pitch, the two umpires
set about putting up the wickets, fitting
the bails. The captains, singling out on
the marked pitch, prepare to toss the
coin. They have excuses to make:
“One of my fellows’s down with a
touch of ’flu.”
“Mine’s wife’s pretty crook.”
“Eleven’d be better, of course.”
“Yes, should be. Anyway, we’re even.”
One of them spins the coin up.
“Heads.”
Heads it is.
AS they turn to arrange with their
teams they notice together that two
others, strangers, have joined in. Stockily-
built chaps wearing dark sweaters ; sand-
shoes ; hatless; their dark hair clipped
bare about ears and necks. They could
pass as twins: a pair of beauties: noses
and ears flattened out; stitch-marked
scars across their eyebrows.
“These chaps want to know can we
give them a game?”
“Can they play?”
“Too right we can, Jack.”
Arthur-called-Jack looks to the other
skipper.
“What do you say to it?”
“Aw, might as well. It’s okay with me.”
“it’ll make eleven, too.”
They walk over to the strangers.
“What are you good at?” says one
of the skippers, trying to decide between
replicas.
“Anything y’ like, Jack.”
“All round,” says the other stranger.
“Right-oh well. Pick which side y’ like.”
“You’re near enough for me. Jack,”
stepping over to the skipper of his choice.
“We’re right, then,” the skipper assures
everybody. “We’re the batting side. We
wait over on the boundary.”
The boundary is an invisible line run-
ning along by the wall of fig-trees. There the
opening batsmen put on their pads, take
up their bats and waddle out to the wicket,
pulling on their batting gloves as they go.
The skipper out there places his field ;
most of them at a good healthy distance
from the wicket; no such finicky stuff
as silly-leg and silly-mid-on ; plenty of
room for good hearty hitting. In a word,
park cricket.
The umpire gives block. The batsman
marks his crease with the toe of his boot,
waves his bat with an approved flourish
and makes a calculating survey of the field.
The bowler steps his way back, drop-
ping an empty cigarette-packet to mark
the start of his run. He gives his right
sleeve-roll another twist and swings his
arm, limbering up. After a confab with
his skipper, the added man goes out to
where coats and hats mark the leg-side
boundary. .
All ready. The batsman facing up in a
Bradman stance. Up trundles the bowler.
The ball lands and makes a long hop,
missing bat and wicket. And ’keeper,
u DOTTEN ! n
As startling as could be, this
dreadful comment, loud enough to be
heard all over the field, comes from the
other added man ; the one sitting chewing
a bit of grass, with his back against the
tree beside his skipper.
The skipper near him is a little nettled.
Hardly the thing, what?
The ’keeper chases the ball in an ele-
phantine jog ; the batsmen run two byes,
noted down by one of the batting side,
sitting apart as scorer against another of
the trees.
The next ball meets a mighty swing of
the bat and soars back over the bowler’s
head. The umpire watches its high curved
flight to safety, and signals “four.”
“Good on y’. Jack!” roars the lone
barracker. All the team under the trees,
scorer included, clap with him.
The batsman takes another look round
the field, picking his place for the next
one. Perhaps forgetting in the excite-
ment of success, he faces up in a style
Bradman neyer dreamt of in his wildest
nightmare. Down comes the hopping
ball; wild swings the bat. He misses by
a yard. So does the ’keeper.
The voice under the trees breaketh the
Sabbath calm:
“Putrid /”
The waiting players there are em-
barrassed ; the captain especially. Not
done, y’ know; not done.
“He’s not the worst bat in the world
when he gets his eye in.”
“He’s all right, Jack,” quite readily
agrees the barracker. “Nothin’ wrong
with him. But did y’ ever see such
bowlin’ in y’r life? Bowl; he couldn’t
bowl me fat aunt!”
All spoken very loudly; candid com-
ment for the Park at large. As the rest
under the trees are feeling about it, just a
bit over the fence. It makes them un-
comfortable. Unaware of this, the side
in the field feel annoyed.
With each run-up of the bowler for
the rest of his over, everybody waits
tensed for more barrack. None comes.
As if considering the case hopeless, the
barracker has spread himself out on his
back, looking up into the tree. Another
sort of pronouncement comes from him:
“Strike me barmy, there’s mistletoe up
there! Doesn’t anybody wanter kiss me?”
A bit of a laugh at that, and he closes
his eyes.
Out on the gentle green turf the game
goes on. It is hit or miss, with, either
way, to wild swings or misses, the score
mounting at a most indecently un-Test-
iike rate.
As it goes on, the skipper tries all his
proved bowlers in turn, and some of the
rest, too.
HE at last makes a change which leads
to the sleeper under the tree being
awakened by a tug at his foot.
“He’s goin’ to give your mate a try.”
The barracker sits up, refreshed.
The new bowler steps out an inordi-
nately long run. He turns, hesitates; then
he comes pounding up. The ball fairly
whizzes down ; it strikes the pitch past
half-way, and shoots up like a bullet at
the batsman. It gets him fair on the hip-
bone ; he has dropped the bat and is twist-
ing in pain, pressing both hands on his
hurt side.
“Murderer /”
Everybody, out in the field and under
the trees, looks towards the barracker.
They agree with him, but with somewhat
different ideas about it. Half of them
with a surging of anger, the others with
a rising of triumph; converting the
bowler at once into villain and hero.
Still with one hand pressing his hip-
bone, the batsman picks up his bat again.
The umpire goes back to his place.
The bowler —sinister or heroic, accord-
ing to viewpoint—has strode back his
distance, and here comes charging up.
A loud clatter of timber. Two yellow
wickets somersaulting backwards. Bails
soaring like birds.
A much relieved batsman heads towards
the trees. The skipper there feeling
very angry with himself for agreeing to
the additions. The skipper out at the
wicket rubbing the ball excitedly on his
shirt-sleeve.
Perhaps a little over-jauntily, the next
batsman makes his way out. The sinister
dark bowler, a malevolent-looking ogre
in that field of cream flannels and green
turf, strides back to the start of his run.
Bounding up; more sinister still.
Hurtled to the mid-pitch, the ball shoots
up like a ricochet. A smack loud enough
to frighten the doves. The batsman a
crumpled heap amongst his trodden
wickets. , ,
A fraction of silence while everybody
waits for it- It comes:
“ Body line. ,
A shout of agreement under the trees,
Out in the field the destroyer turning
to his skipper:
“Will y lissen t th squealers. W
oughter go in an clean em up. An
to the batsman, getting shakily to his
feet: You re out, fellow.
Holding his head with both hands,
leaving his bat amongst the stumps, the
batsman limps off.
The skipper out by the pitch gives the
ball a great old polishing on his shirt-
front. Springing up, the other skipper
goes out to help his casualty from the
field. .
“Like to see you make it a hat-trick.
says skipper to bowler; not muting his
voice, either.
Taking the pad off the injured, the bat-
ting skipper claps it on his own leg. He
being a bowler, it’s the supreme act of
courage. He goes out defiantly.
a hat-trick all right. He sees the
bowler trundling up; he hears the loud
clattering of his wickets. He turns and

VARIOUS VERSE.
Red Cedar.
Slip from the channel, cold In the high bank’s
shade,
And now the sunlight pours through the gap,
and now
For the long, snag-threatened, rock-scraped pull
I am paid,
And with uplifted face, uplifted oar,
Let me be still and wonder at this thing —
A cedar in young amber leaf for spring.
How the light showers on the tree and drips
among
The strong roots drawing it up to burst from
the bough —
Bronze, gold, silk, flame, all these the leaves are,
and more,
That leap to the blue sky in a blaze of joy.
Winter’s austere grace not yet veiled, but kindled
To glory, the towering strength made delicate,
young —
For what is youth but this bright, heart-piercing
beauty
That the cold axe in a man’s hand could fell
(Ten thousand have fallen at thy right hand,
my fair one,
Shall it not come nigh thee?) or white-hot bolt
destroy
Or the doom of summer, the great fires’ roaring
hell.
When I look again on the dark-red, polished
wood
Glowing in lamplight and lovely in death, kept
dry
And safe while the storm shakes the house,
my heart will see
How lovelier yet in the ardor of life it stood—*
Rocks, glooms, and perils about it, the spring-
time tree,
Burning with beauty, naked under the sky.

Meridian.
He sought the mirror’s image, and he found
Time staring brashly through a sunken face
Whose eyes saw yesterday, and in their round
Deep stillness saw tomorrow’s steady pace.
He turned away, and on the cracked bare wall
The image lived again; there he could see
Time’s slender thread twist in a. crazy scrawl
Behind and through the imaged certainty.
And in the room time lived, so that the clock
Echoed his pulse-beat and the cabined gloom
Of his small world vibrated to the shock
Of time incarcerated in a room.
He shut his eyes in fear. He would not read
Within the mirror’s mirror time’s great need.

Land of the Legend.
Strange —to make of a place, once known, a
legend
And to recall the hills and paddocks and streams
Not as they were, hot in the sun, or hard, or
wet to the feet.
But insubstantial, a country only of dreams.
The birds, the blue lories and the bronze pigeons
Fly past the mind; but never to hear their wings
Is to find the words of a song and forget the
tune,
Or to know the tune and lack the voice which
sings.
It is to have said with pride—here is my land
The joy and secret place within my heart —
To learn that the purchase was made by an
earlier comer
Who locked the gates. It is to have no part
In ploughing and loving and gathering a crop
But to stand without, musing—had it been mine
Such and such would I do, or have done —and
then
Fantastic impractical plans fall into line
Until there’s a myth, an old and faded story —
Sharp edge of its bitterness blunted and gone
for ever
Like that of a crowd in a picture, arrested in
time,
Who make the gestures of movement yet will
never
Complete the journey from nowhere into some-
where. ..
An inexplicable point of utter cessation,
Insidious, final and unquestionable,
The last transition from truth to imagination.
Here is no painted scene, but a glorious tale
Spun from the blackberry tangle of confusion;
A sudden splendor of fenceless territory
Where the first departure leads from the last
conclusion.
Land of the legend and the heart’s possession—
No region for the body, but boundless and good
For the recondite senses beyond the eyes and
the ears
That have seen and listened and perfectly
understood.

The Kitchen.

Clothes lie in clean disorder on the chairs;
The kettle whispers tensely on the stove
And pushes steam past its indignant lid
With a rattle and an agitated shove.
Beneath the water’s simmer, the oven noises,
Rumbles the fire, cracks the wood, and hidden
Flames like torrents rush through narrow spaces
And pass in smoke up the chimney, flowing
with sudden
Whiteness on to the winter air to vanish
In gusts of wind that blow from western
places;
And the afternoon sun lights flowers on the
curtains
And, glancing from glass tumblers, leaps to
our faces.
n.
The Victorian clock on the mantelpiece with
proper
Station dominates the kitchen, keeps
Too-accurate time and swings its pendulum
Above the box where the brindled kitten
sleeps.
The minute hand at twenty-to-four discovers
A saucer of milk set safely under the stool
And slowly moves to encompass the fragrant
room,
Like the bony finger of a fretful old fool
Who clicks the wasted hours away on the same
Mild eccentricities till midnight’s care
Finds him a lonely man with two thin hands
Pressed upward in blind attitude of prayer.

There are poppies on the table leaning over
A cloth as green as garden grass and as neat,
And a centre, flower-worked, seems to nurture
them : , .
Long-stemmed beauties, ardent yet discreet.
A spotted picture of six dogs playing cards
Hangs on the wall and the bulldog is slipping
an ace .
To his partner the collie, who, though his baCK

You may guess is wearing an inscrutable face.
Near by a calendar is pinned askew
With marks of customary style to show

And other events the family should know.

A brilliant new Radioplayer in two models for electric or
battery operation
model 101
Philips have produced an en-
tirely new 5-valve, dual-wave
table type radioplayer known as
the Philips 101. 101 is a good
designation because this is a
radio with a hundred-and-one
advantages. The aerial is in-
built; the on-off switch is on the
receiver itself; the tone of the
set pleases even those musical
critics who have a Cardus-com-
plex; the cabinets are made in
eye-pleasing colours. Altogether
it’s the kind of receiver which
gives hosts a sense of smug self-
satisfaction because it fills guests
with envy. Price £27/15/-.

NAZI-SOVIET SECRET DOCUMENTS.
Fed-up with the sustained
Soviet campaign of vilification
and abuse, screeched in Commu-
nist billingsgate over the past
year by Moscow radio and press
and in conferences by such peri-
patetic loudspeakers as Molotov
and Vyshinsky, the U.S. State
Department last month took a
harsh revenge. In a 357-page
volume it published for the
world at large 260 of the secret
diplomatic documents captured
near the end of the fighting in
Germany, telling the inside story
of tRe dealings which led to the
. Nazi-Soviet pact of partnership
and war.
But for a singular historical
accident, with the hand of
Destiny on it, these facts might
never have come out.
With all the other like records
of the German Foreign Office
covering the period''lB7l-1944,
they were found, stacked in
brown numbered bundles, in
some chateaux captured by the
U.S. Ninth Division in the Harz
Mountains in April, 1945. They
were in the charge of a German
Foreign Office archivist, Baron
von Griesheim, who a few days
earlier had received a telegram
from Berlin telling fiim to
destroy the contents of certain
rooms. But the archivist was
first of all an archivist. To fool
his watchers he burnt old news-
papers.
“But the documents,” he said,
“I did not touch. I believed
they must be saved so that the
historian of the future may
determine the facts and the res-
ponsibility for this terrible war,”
Soviet Starts It
Thus preserved and now made
public* the story of the in-
famous partnership opens with
the initiative, the first move, on
the Soviet side —a visit paid by
the Soviet Ambassador in Ger-
many, Merekalov, to the State
Secretary in the German
Foreign Office, Weizsaecker, in
Berlin on April 17, 1939.
Weizsaecker’s memorandum on
the visit:
The Ambassador stated approxi-
mately as follows:
Russian policy had always moved
in a straight line. Ideological dif-
ferences of opinion had hardly in-
fluenced the Russian-Italian relation-
ship, and they did not have to prove
a stumbling-block with regard to
Germany either. Soviet Russia had
not exploited the present friction be-
tween Germany and the Western de-
mocracies against us [Germany], nor
did she desire to do so. There exists
for Russia no reason why she should
not live with us on a normal footing.
And from normal the relations might
become better and better.
In May, the German Charge
in Moscow, Tippelskirch, re-
ported the “greatest surprise”
there over Molotov’s replacing
the relegated Litvinov, who, like
Our Own Foreign Policy, had
flashed for a while in the inter-
national firmament, and who, at
the time, “was in the midst of
negotiations with the English
delegation.” Tippelskirch re-
ported :
The decision is apparently con-
nected with the fact that differences
of opinion arose in the Kremlin on
Litvinov’s negotiations. Reason for
differences of opinion presumably lies
in deep mistrust that Stalin harbors
toward the entire surrounding capi-
talist world.
Regarding those negotiations
—in which, of course, Stalin
eventually preferred Hitler —the
German Ambassador in Mos-
cow, Schulenburg, at that stage
sent a word of warning to Berlin
typical of the mutual suspicions
threading all through the thieves’
partnership;
We must be extremely cautious in
this field as long as it is not certain
that possible proposals from our side
will not be used by the Kremlin only
to exert pressure on England and
France.
The next move in the Soviet
initiative towards the partner-
ship was a roundabout one,
made in Berlin and outlined in a
memorandum on June 5 by
Woermann, of the German
Foreign Office:
The Bulgarian Minister [Draganoff]
called on me today and told me con-
fidentially the following:—
The Soviet Russian Charge [Asta-
khov], with whom he had no intimate
relations, called on him yesterday
without any apparent reason and
stayed with him two hours....
The Soviet Union [Astakhov had
told him] faced the present world
situation with hesitation. She was
vacillating between three possi-
bilities, namely the conclusion of the
pact with England and France, a
further dilatory treatment of the pact
negotiations, and a rapprochement with
Germany. This last possibility, with
which ideological considerations would
not have to become involved, was
closest to the desires of the Soviet
Union.
In addition, there were other points,
for instance that the Soviet Union
did not recognise the Rumanian pos-
session of Bessarabia. The fear of
a German attack, however, either via
the Baltic countries or Via Rumania
was an obstacle.
In this connection the Chargd had
also referred to Mein Kampf. If
Germany would declare that she
would not attack the Soviet Union
or that she would conclude a non-
aggression pact with her, the Soviet
Union would probably refrain from
concluding a treaty with England.
However, the Soviet Union did not
know what Germany really wanted,
aside from certain very vague
allusions....
At the .end Herr Draganoff re-
peated again that he had no indi-
cation why Herr Astakhov had given
him this information. He was pon-
dering the possibility that this was
probably done with the intention of
having Herr Draganoff report it to
us.
Nazis Respond
That deduction no doubt
striking Ribbentrop as element-
ary, the German side made the
next move, in Moscow on June
28, when Schulenburg had a con-
versation with Molotov, who, he
noted, received him immediately
after he had been announced.
The conversation “proceeded
in a friendly manner” (with the
usual leaven of suspicions),
Schulenburg feeling out on what
Molotov had meant in a pre-
vious conversation by his refer-
ence to the “creation of a new
basis of our relationship,”
Molotov leaving that question
open but remarking, regarding
non-aggression pacts, that he
“had to doubt the permanence
of such treaties after the experi-
ence which Poland had had”
(Hitler’s terminating of his
Polish treaty). Schulenburg,
naturally, blamed Poland,
Ribbentrop took the next step,
sending Schulenburg on August
14 a long telegram (“Most
Urgent”) telling him to try to
arrange for a Ribbentrop-Stalin
meeting and meanwhile to have
a talk with Molotov on these
lines:
The developments of the recent
period seem to show that differing
world outlooks do not prohibit a
reasonable relationship between the
two States [Germany-Russia], and the
restoration of co-operation of a new
and friendly type.
There exist no real conflicts of
interest between Germany and the
U.S.S.R. The living spaces of Ger-
many and the U.S.S.R. touch each
other, but in their natural require-
ments they do not conflict. There
m no question between the Baltic and
N.Y. “Daily Mirror !"
MAHOMET AND THE MOUNTAIN.
(But this is where the Mountain can come to Mahomet —or else. The
frequently-raised question of a Truman-Stalin meeting came up again most
recently in December, when Truman once more said he would be most
happy to meet Stalin —in Washington .)
the Black Seas which cannot be
settled to the complete satisfaction of
both countries. Among these are
such questions as: the Baltic Sea,
the Baltic area, Poland, South-eastern
questions, etc. In such matters
political co-operation between the two
countries can have only a beneficial
effect. The same applies to German
and Soviet economy, which can be
expanded in any direction....
The Reich Government and the
Soviet Government must, judging
from all experience, count it as
certain that the capitalistic Western
democracies are the unforgiving
enemies of both National Socialist
Germany and of the U.S.S.R. They
are trying again, by the conclusion
of a military alliance, to drive the
U.S.S.R. into the war against Ger-
many. In 1914 this policy had dis-
astrous results for Russia. It is the
compelling interest of both countries
to avoid for all future time the de-
struction of Germany and of the
U.S.S.R., which would profit only the
Western democracies.
Instructions obeyed, Schulen-
burg telegraphed Berlin on
August 16 (“Very Urgent.
Secret.”):
Molotov received with greatest in-
terest the information I had been
authorised to convey, designated it
as extremely important, and declared
that he would report it to his Gov-
ernment at once and give me an
answer shortly. He could already
state that the Soviet Government
warmly welcomed German intentions
of improving relations with the Soviet
Union, and in view of my communi-
cation of today now believes in the
sincerity of these intentions.... He
was interested in the question of how
the German Government was dis-
posed to the idea of concluding a
non-aggression pact with the Soviet
Union, and, further, whether the Ger-
man Government was prepared to
influence Japan for the purpose of
improvement in Soviet-Japanese re-
lations and settlement of border con-
flicts and whether a possible joint
guarantee of the Baltic States, was
contemplated by Germany.
Schulenburg followed that up
the same day with another
communication, emphasi sing
that Molotov had been “quite
unusually compliant and can-
did,” “surprisingly moderate in
his demands” and “more signi-
ficant in his quite clearly ex-
pressed wish to conclude a non-
aggression pact with us.”
Soviet Distrust
The fish thus biting well (as
was only natural, seeing that
they themselves had first put
the bait in the fishermen’s
hands), Ribbentrop wired back
urgent the same day, instructing
Schulenburg to see Molotov
again and tell him:
The points brought up by Herr
Molotov are in accordance with Ger-
man desires. That is, Germany is
ready to conclude a non-aggression
pact with the Soviet Union and, if
the Soviet Government so desires, one
which would be irrevocable for a term
of 25 years. Further, Germany is
ready to guarantee the Baltic States
jointly with the Soviet Union. Finally,
it is thoroughly in accord with the
German position, and Germany is
ready, to exercise influence for an
improvement and consolidation of
Russian-Japanese relations.
The Fiihrer is of the opinion that,
in view of the present situation, and
of the possibility of the occurrence
any day of serious incidents (please
at this point explain to Herr Molotov
that Germany is determined not to
endure Polish provocation indefinitely),
a basic and rapid clarification of
German-Russian relations and the
mutual adjustment of the pressing
questions are desirable.
About this stage of the dicker-
ings, Schulenburg was able to
report to Berlin that —in con-
trast to the “quite unusually
compliant and candid” Molotov
of his other report—Molotov, in
the Soviet - British -French
negotiations going on at the
same time, “sat like a bump
on a log”: “He hardly ever
opened his mouth* and if he did
it was to utter only the brief
remark, ‘Your statements do not
appear to me entirely satis-
factory. I shall notify my
Government.’ ” On the other
hand, regarding their own
negotiations: “I believe that we
put a few good fleas in the ears
of the Soviets, anyhow.” He,
however, had to add;
At every word and at every step
one can see the great distrust toward
us. That this is so, we have known
for a long time. The unfortunate
part of it is that the mistrust of
such people is very easily kindled and
can only be allafed slowly and with
difficulty.
On August 18, Ribbentrop
wired (“Very Urgent”) ordering
Schulenburg to have another
conversation with Molotov and
press for an early Ribbentrop-
Stalin meeting:
In this connection you must keep
in mind the decisive fact that an
early outbreak of open German-
Polish conflict is probable and that
we therefore have the greatest in-
terest in having my visit to Moscow
take place immediately.
Ribbentrop Meets Stalin
Schulenburg sent back to
Berlin that day the Soviet non-
aggression pact draft which had
been handed to him. There was
to be a “special” (i.e., secret)
protocol “covering the poiqts in
which the High Contracting
Parties are interested in the
field of foreign policy” (in other
words, what each low den of
thieves would regard as its pre-
serve for looting).
On further urgent representa-
tions by Ribbentrop, the meet-
ing with Stalin took place on
August 23.
The bargaining went on
through the night of August
23-24, after which the following
mfemorandum on it was drawn
up by Hencke for Ribbentrop
headed “Very Secret! State
Secret”:
The following problems were dis-
cussed :
(1) Japan:
The Reich Foreign Minister stated
that the German-Japanese friendship
was in no wise directed against the
Soviet Union. We were, rather, in
a position, owing to our good re-
lations with Japan, to make an effec-
tive contribution to an adjustment
of the differences between the Soviet
Union and Japan
Herr Stalin replied that the Soviet
Union indeed desired an improve-
ment in its relations with Japan, but
that there were limits to its patience
with regard to Japanese provocations.
If Japan desired war, it could have
it. The Soviet Union was not afraid
of it and was prepared for it. If
Japan desired peace—so much the
better! Herr Stalin considered the
assistance of Germany in bringing
about an improvement in Soviet-
Japanese relations as useful, but he
did not want the Japanese to get the
impression that the initiative in this
direction had been taken by the Soviet
Union.
The Reich Foreign Minister
assented....
(2) Italy:
Herr Stalin inquired of the Reich
Foreign Minister as to Italian aims.
Did not Italy have aspirations be-
yond the annexation of Albania —

perhaps for Greek territory? Small,
mountainous, and thinly populated,
Albania was, in his estimation, or no
particular use to Italy.
The Reich Foreign Minister re-
plied that Albania was important to
Italy for strategic reasons. Moreover,
Mussolini was a strong man who
could not be intimidated.
This he had demonstrated in the
Abyssinian conflict, in which Italy
had asserted its aims by its own
strength against a hostile coalition.
Even Germany was not yet in a
position at that time to give Italy
appreciable support.
Mussolini, welcomed warmly the
restoration of friendly relations be-
tween Germany and the Soviet Union.
(3) Turkey: .
Herr Stalin asked the Reich
Foreign Minister what Germany
thought about Turkey.
The Reich Foreign Minister ex-
pressed himself as follows in this
matter: He had months ago de-
clared to the Turkish Government
that Germany desired friendly re-
lations with Turkey. The Reich
Foreign Minister had himself done
everything to achieve this goal. The
answer had been that Turkey became
one of the first countries to join
the encirclement pact against Germany
and had not even considered it
necessary to notify the Reich Gov-
ernment of the fact.
Herren Stalin and Molotov here-
upon observed that the Soviet Union
had also had a similar experience with
the vacillating policy of the Turks.
The Reich Foreign Minister men-
tioned further that England had spent
five million pounds in Turkey in order
to disseminate propaganda against
Germany.
Herr Stalin said that according to
his information the amount which
England had spent in buying Turkish
politicians was considerably more than
five million pounds.
(4) England:
Herren Stalin and Molotov com-
mented adversely on the British Mili-
tary Mission in Moscow, which had
never told the Soviet Government
what it really wanted.
The Reich Foreign Minister stated
in this connection that England had
always been trying and was still try-
ing to disrupt the development of
good relations between Germany and
the Soviet Union. England was weak
and wanted to let others fight for
its presumptuous claim to world
domination.
Herr Stalin eagerly concurred and
observed as follows: The British
Army was weak; the British Navy
no longer deserved its previous repu-
tation. England’s air arm was being
increased, to be sure, but there was
a lack of pilots. If England dominates
the world in spite of this, this was
due to the stupidity of the other
countries that always let themselves
be bluffed. It was ridiculous, for
example, that a few hundred British
should dominate India.
The Reich Foreign Minister con-
curred and informed Herr Stalin that
he had proposed to the Fiihrer to
inform the British that every hostile
British act, in case of a German-
Polish conflict, would be answered by
a bombing attack on London.
Herr Stalin further expressed the
opinion that England, despite its
weakness, would wage war craftily
and stubbornly.
(5) France:
Herr Stalin expressed the opinion
that France had an army worthy of
consideration.
The Reich Foreign Minister, on
his part, pointed out to Herren Stalin
and Molotov the numerical inferiority
of France. While Germany had
available an annual class of more
than 300,000 soldiers, France could
muster only 150,000 recruits annu-
ally. The West Wall was five times
as strong as the Maginot Line. If
France attempted to wage war with
Germany she would certainly be con :
quered.
(6) Anti-Comintern Pact:
The Reich Foreign Minister
observed that the Anti-Comintern
Pact was basically directed not against
the Soviet Union but against the
Western democracies. He knew,
and was able to infer from the tone
of the Russian press, that the Soviet
Government fully recognised this fact.
Herr Stalin interposed that the
Anti-Comintem Pact had in fact
frightened principally the City of
London and the small British mer-
chants.
The Reich Foreign Minister con-
curred and remarked jokingly that
Herr Stalin was surely less frightened
by the Anti-Comintern Pact than the
City of London and the small British
merchants. What the German people
thought of this matter was evident from
a joke which had originated with the
the Berliners, well known for their wit
and humor, and which had been going
the rounds for several months,
namely, “Stalin will yet join the Anti-
Comintern Pact.”
After that example of up-
roarious humor, Ribbentrop
assured Stalin that the German
people, “and especially the
simple people,” “most warmly
welcomed the understanding
with the Soviet Union” because
they “desired peace”:
The people felt instinctively that
between Germany and the Soviet
Union no natural conflicts of in-
terests existed, and that the develop-
ments of good relations had hitherto
been disturbed only b'y foreign in-
trigue, in particular on the part of
England.
The formal business of the
conniving ended with Ribben-
trop stating that, while “it was
certainly true that the German
people desired peace....on the
other hand, indignation against
Poland was so great that every
single man was ready to fight.
The German people would no
longer put up with Polish pro-
vocation.” After that Stalin
toasted the Fiihrer, Molotov
toasted Ribbentrop and then
toasted Stalin, Ribbentrop re-
turned the compliments, and
“Herren Molotov and Stalin
drank repeatedly to the Non-
aggression Pact, the new era of
German-Russian relations, and
to the German nation.” After
all of which, no doubt, loud
and prolonged snores.
War: Congratulations!
The Non-aggression Pact —
really the signal for Hitler to
start war —had tagged on to it
a secret additional protocol con-
cerned with the boundaries of
the German-Soviet “respective
spheres of influence in Eastern
Europe,” Subsequent naggings
over some of these boundaries —
the Russians claiming fresh
areas from time to time —partly
accounted for the thieves finally
falling out (a potent other cause,
on the opposite side, was
Hitler’s frequent habit of acting
first and telling his partner after-
wards).
One clause of the secret pro-
tocol shows very plainly the
coldblooded attitude of both
sets of thieves looking towards
the prospective loot (also it must
ring rather violently in the ears
of the Poles, now enjoying the
benefits of Soviet “friendship”
and “protection”):
The question of whether the in-
terests of both parties [Germany-
Russia] make desirable the mainten-
ance of an independent Polish State
and how such a State should be
bounded can only be definitely de-
termined in the course of further
political developments.
The Non-aggression Pact
(with secret protocols) duly
signed, the war it let loose was
presently on, and Schulenburg
was wiring to Berlin:
I have just received the following
telephone message from Molotov:
“I have received your communica-
tion regarding the entry of German
troops into Warsaw. Please convey
my congratulations and greetings to
the German Reich Government.”
Stab in the Back
By way of hypocrite cover
for the Red Army’s stab in the
back to finish off Poland came
Molotov’s childlike and bland
suggestion to Schulenburg, as
reported to Berlin by the Ger-
man Ambassador:
Molotov... .stated that the Soviet
Government had intended to take the
occasion of the further advance of
German troops to declare that Poland
was falling apart and that it was
necessary for the Soviet Union, in
consequence, to come to the aid of
the Ukrainians and the White Rus-
sians “threatened” by Germany. The
argument was to make the interven-
tion of the Soviet Union plausible to
the masses and at the same time avoid
giving the Soviet Union the appear-
ance of an aggressor.
(It should be noted here that
admission of these documents
was refused by the Nuremburg
War Crimes Tribunal, which
sentenced the German leaders,
including military and naval
men, to be hanged or jailed for
their part in starting and waging
aggressive warfare.)
Of course, Molotov’s notion
of an appropriately worded lie
to justify the stab in the back
was promptly turned down by
the Nazis, who, ever ready in
such things, sent back their own
idea of how the lie should be
couched.
It wjas agreed that a joint
communique should be issued,
but there was further difference
on the wording. In a memor-
andum on this dickering, Hilger,
of the German Embassy in
Moscow, reported S t a 1 i n’s
tender scruples: “Herr Stalin
declared that in his opinion,
too, a joint communique had to
be issued, but that he could not
entirely agree to the text pro-
posed by us since it presented
the facts all too frankly.” Stalin
promptly wrote one out himself,
and a joint communique was
issued, in part as follows:
In view of the internal incapacity
of the Polish State [attacked in the
front by Germany’s armed might and
stabbed in the back, when tottering,
by the Soviet Red Army], and of
the dissension of the populations
living in its former territory, the
Reich Government and the Govern-
ment of the U.S.S.R. consider it
necessary to bring to an end the
intolerable political and economic
conditions existing in these terri-
tories. ...
The real Soviet feeling to-
wards Poland, behind the pious
humbug of that joint comr
munique (given to the world on
September 18), was expressed on
September 25, as reported to
Berlin by Schulenburg (“Very
Urgent. Strictly Secret.”):
Stalin and Molotov asked me to
come to the Kremlin at 8 p.m. to-
day. Stalin stated the following:
In the final settlement of the Polish
question anything that in the future
might create friction between Ger-
many and the Soviet Union must be
avoided. From this point of view,
he considered it wrong to leave an
independent Polish .rump State. He
proposed the following: From the
territory to the east of the demarcation
line, all the Province of Lublin and
that portion of the Province of War-
saw which extends to the Bug should
be added to our share. In return,
we should waive our claim to Lithu-
ania.
That is, they would wipe
Poland out as a State and whack
its territory up between them!
(Apropos of that, the spirited
rhetoric of Mr. Churchill ad-
dressing the House of Commons
on February 27, 1945, seems
worth recalling. Said Mr.
Churchill, amid cheers:
But for the prodigious exertions
and sacrifices of Russia, Poland was
doomed to utter destruction at the
hands of the Germans, blot only
Poland as a State and as a nation,
but the Poles as a race were doomed
by Hiller to be destroyed or reduced
to a servile station... .When the Ger-
mans had clearly avowed their inten-
tion of making the Poles a subject
and lower-grade race under the Her-
renvolk, suddenly, by a superb effort
of military force and skill, the Rus-
sian armies advanced from the
Vistula to the Oder,.. .freeing the
whole of Poland.
Only three years ago! -Disil-
lusionment has seldom been so
complete.)
Soviet Well-Informed
A German-Soviet Boundary
and Friendship Treaty having
been cooked up in the thieves’
kitchen for the further demar-
cation of the areas of loot,
things went along fairly well for
a time, with Russia, under their
economic agreement, supplying
huge quantities of food and the
like to its partner. But on
April 11, 1940, Schulenburg was
reporting to Berlin on suddenly
running into difficulties with the
Soviet Government, In a day
or two, however, “it became
apparent that the Soviet Govern-
ment had again made a com-
plete about-face,” putting the
temporary “suspension of
petroleum and grain shipments”
down to “excessive zeal of sub-
ordinate agencies,” which
“would be remedied immedi-
ately.” Schulenburg reported:
In my opinion there is only one
explanation for this about-face: our
Scandinavian operations must have
relieved the Soviet Government enor-
mously—removed a great burden of
anxiety, so to speak. What their
apprehension consisted of can again
not be determined with certainty. I
suspect the following: The Soviet
Government is always extraordinarily
well-informed. If the English and
French intended to occupy Norway
and Sweden it may be assumed with
certainty that the Soviet Government
knew of these plans and was appar-
ently terrified by them. The Soviet
Government saw the English and
French appearing on the shores of the
Baltic Sea, and they saw the Finnish
question reopened, as Lord Halifax
had announced; finally they dreaded
most of all the danger of becoming
involved in a war with two Great
Powers. Apparently this fear was
relieved by us.
Only in this way can the completely
changed attitude of Herr Molotov be
understood at any rate —at least
at the moment “everything is in
order” again here, and our affairs
are going as they should.
Thanks to Communist fifth-
columnists everywhere, no doubt
it still holds good that “The
Soviet Government is always
extraordinarily well-informed.”
Cripps Sees Stalin
Before mid-1940 there were
spasms of friction between the
parties over the Baltic and the
Balkans —Moscow complaining
about treaty infractions (Hitler
not sharing advance information
on acts he committed and his
barging into the agreed Russian
loot preserves), and Berlin com-
plaining about Russian greed.
Still, the supplies flowed in
from Russia, and the partners
remained matey enough for
Schulenburg to be able to send
to Berlin, on July 13, 1940, the
following memorandum throw-
ing light on J. Bull (alias at the
time Stafford Cripps) in the
minor role of spurned wooer of
the Bear (it throws light, also—
as do most of the quoted docu-
ments —on general Soviet policy
and aims, past, present and
pending):
Molotov informed me today that
Cripps, the British Ambassador here,
had been received by Stalin a few
days ago upon request of the British
Government. On instructions from
Stalin, Molotov gave me a memoran-
dum of this conversation.
Cripps inquired regarding the atti-
tude of the Soviet Government to-
ward the following questions;
(1) The British Government was
convinced that Germany was striving
for hegemony in Europe and wanted
to engulf all European countries.
This was dangerous to the Soviet
Union as well as England. There-
fore both countries ought to agree
on a. common policy of self-protection
against Germany and on the re-
establishment of the European bal-
ance of power.
(2) Irrespective of this, England
would like to trade with the Soviet
Union, provided that England’s ex-
ports would not be resold to Ger-
many.
(3) The British Government was of
the opinion that unification and
leadership of the Balkan countries
for the purpose of maintaining the
status quo was rightly the task of
the Soviet Union. Under present
circumstances this important mission
could be carried out only by the
Soviet Union.
(4) The British Government knew
that the Soviet Union was dissatisfied
with the regime in the Straits and
in the Black Sea. Cripps was of the
opinion that the interests of the
Soviet Union in the Straits must be
safeguarded.
Stalin’s answers are given as fol-
lows : •
(1) The Soviet Government was,
of course, very much interested in
present events in Europe, but he
(Stalin) did not see any danger of
the hegemony of any one country
in Europe and still less any danger
that Europe might be engulfed by
Germany. Stalin observed the policy
of Germany, and knew several lead-
ing German statesmen well. He had
not discovered any desire on their
part to engulf European countries.
Stalin was not of the opinion that
German military successes menaced
the Soviet Union and her friendly
relations with Germany. These re-
lations were not based on transient
circumstances, but on the basic
national interests of both countries.
The so-called European balance of
power had hitherto oppressed not
only Germany, but also the Soviet
Union. Therefore, the Soviet Union
would take all measures to prevent
the re-establishment of the old balance
of power in Europe.
(2) The Soviet Union did not object
to trading with England, but she
contested the right of England or
any other country to interfere tfvith
German-Soviet commercial relations.
The Soviet Union would export to
Germany, in accordance with treaty
provisions, part of the nonferrous
metals she bought abroad, because
Germany needed these metals for
the manufacture of the war matdriel
she delivered to the Soviet Union.
If England did not recognise these
conditions, trade between England and
the Soviet Union was impossible.
(3) In Stalin’s opinion no Power
had the right to an exclusive role
in the consolidation and leadership
of the Balkan countries. The Soviet
Union did not claim such a mission
either, although she was interested in
Balkan affairs.
(4) Regarding Turkey, Stalin de-
dared that the Soviet Union was
in fact opposed to the exclusive juris-
diction of Turkey over the Straits
and to Turkey’s dictation of con-
ditibns in the Black Sea. The Turkish
Government was aware of that.
Protocol on Loot
In November, 1940, Molotov
was in Berlin conversing with
Hitler on the elevated theme of
prospective spheres of loot. This
scheming fell down because
Molotov asked for too much,
and from this point the thieves’
partnership began to disinte-
grate. The prospectus was a
draft agreement between Ger-
many, Italy and Japan on the
one side and the Soviet Union
on the other, with this secret
protocol as its pendant pride:
The Representatives of Germany,
Italy, Japan and the Soviet Union
declare as follows;
(1) Germany declares that, apart
from the territorial revisions in Europe
to be carried out at the conclusion
of peace, her territorial aspirations
centre in the territories of Central
Africa.
(2) Italy declares that, apart from
the territorial revisions in Europe to
be carried out at the conclusion of
peace, her territorial aspirations centre
in the territories of Northern and
North-eastern Africa.
(3) Japan declares that her terri-
torial aspirations centre in the area
of Eastern Asia to the south of the
Island Empire of Japan.
(4) The Soviet Union declares that
its territorial aspirations centre south
of the national territory of the Soviet
Union in the direttion of the Indian
Ocean.
The Thieves Fall Out
Alas, for such modest aims!
Only a month later —on
December 18, 1940; six months
before he committed the fell
deed of falling on the neck of
his partner with an axe—Hitler
issued to his war command
Directive No. 21, Operation
Barbarossa (“Military Secret.
Top Secret”), beginning:
The German Armed Forces must
be prepared to crush Soviet Russia
in a quick campaign even before the
conclusion of the war against Eng-
land
The Fiihrer went on for a
thousand or two words giving
detailed instructions on how
that was to be done.
In the following six months
friction over Hitler’s' Balkan
moves rose to strident com-
plaints by both sides over their
respective planes committing
border infringements.
On June 21, 1941, Schulen-
burg in Moscow received from
Berlin his instructions to an-
nounce the partnership off and
the war on.
The curtain was down on
what good Peter Quince would
have called this “most lament-
able comedy.” Off-stage every-
where sounded the thumping ac-
companiment o f prodigious
Communist somersaults.

STONEWALLING.
For all intents and purposes of our
socialist rulers Parliament might just as
well have continued in recess for at least
the first half of this year. The Govern-
ment has nothing for it to do except
debate a bill to be introduced ratifying
the Geneva International Trade Agree-
ment, which does not matter much any-
how because (1) it can hardly be con-
clusive without a decision on the later
Havana Charter for implementing it—
and that is still in the air—and (2) our
own trade is drying-up daily under
socialist restrictions. As Hilaire Belloc
sang in days gone by of the Board of
Trade:
First there wasn’t any Board,
And now there isn’t any Trade.
There may also be produced before
June a bill to provide for a larger Senate,
the forerunner of a larger Parliament in
both Houses. This whole scheme is a
purely seat-saving device by “Labor,” in
which party interests have completely
eclipsed any consideration of the national
welfare.
The programme is for the House of
Representatives to sit for four weeks and
then adjourn for three weeks at Easter.
About April 7 it will meet again for an-
other four or five weeks and adjourn
once more for the referendum on price-
control, to be held on May 29. If the
Government wins that appeal, Parliament
will reassemble to pass a bill to give it
statutory effect; if not, and in any case
thereafter, the Government will prorogue
Parliament until September, the Budget
session, when Mr. McKell will have his
first shot as G.-G. in opening Parliament
with full ceremony.
The Senate will not meet until after
Hristcr
It is abundantly clear that thei Govern-
ment has only one thing on its mind —
the preparation of the political soil for
the 1949 elections. What it is waiting
anxiously to know between now and June
next is (1) the High Court’s judgment on
the Bank Grab Act, and (2) the result of
the referendum in which it is seeking
control permanently by the central Gov-
ernment of all prices, rents and charges
whatsoever throughout Australia. Till it
knows whether it is going to be allowed
to socialise industry, to reduce the States
to nonentities and install the machinery
for a totalitarian Government in this
democracy, the Chifley Ministry is com-
pletely stalled. Development of Australia
depends, for “Labor,” on totalitarian gov-
ernment and nothing else.
Upon the results of the Banking case
(with appeal from the High Court to
the Privy Council, which has been pro-
claimed as certain in any event), and of
the referendum appeal, the Government
is depending for its election prospects.
And some Caucusites, as the vote on seat-
redistribution showed, are far from happy.
The position is made for the Opposition
allies to renew the offensive, pursued with
good results late last year—results bene-
ficial as well to the country at large.
The Chifley Ministry’s resources are
exhausted. It dare not as yet go farther
along the road to socialisation; it dare
not retreat from the point it has reached
on that road, despite the mess and the
electoral disfavor into which it has fallen.
Administration has become negligent,
inept, and in specific instances is under
suspicion of corruption. The disclosures
in petrol-racket cases, the gross delays
and expense imposed on traders by the
prices-control system, the land-sales in-
quiry, the extensive and growing black-
marketeering, the inordinately oppressive
taxation which defies any attempt at
justification—all these things, not to men-
tion matters at present sub judice in the
Courts, are eloquent of a topheavy
bureaucracy which is breaking down
under the weight of its own cumbrous
process, and of a form of government-
by-regulation which is inciting widespread
contempt for the law. Corruption there-
under is inevitable.
To the confusion and bewilderment
bred by this inefficiency and oppression
in the Administration itself is added the
anarchy in industry caused by revolt of
the militant unions from the authority of
the industrial-Courts. Essential produc-
tion and most reproductive enterprise have
for long been halted by the sheer bush-
jranging of union executives against the
Australian community, its reserves of in-
dustrial strength and even its elected
Governments.
Mr, Chifley’s “recession” is upon
him. So far as it was ever true
that Australia could be “geared to meet
it” by the Coombs-Chifley specifics, these
specifics have failed. The economic show-
down which everybody now awaits —even
“the workers” —is of socialism’s own
creating. Parliament cannot call back the
years which the socialist locusts have
eaten, but it is the Opposition’s duty to
work its hardest to limit to the smallest
possible measure further waste under this
destructive regime. All the country’s
tried and traditional institutions, the ex-
pression of the British character of our
society, are under assault.
What the Opposition must do is to
reveal to the people how “Labor,” to the
eminent satisfaction of the Communists,
is killing Parliament as a deliberative
assembly and substituting its own Caucus
for the national legislature—introducing,
in effect, the totalitarian one-party system
through back-door methods. That evil
growth can lead only to calamity and
violence for our people; and its cor-
ruptive influence is clearly visible in
Caucus’s scheme for enlarging Parliament.
If "Dev." Came Here.
Under the Constitution of Eire, an odd
thing by American and British Common-
wealth standards but with praiseworthy
features, the Prime Minister or Taoiseach
(“pronounced Theashoch’ ”) is elected by
the House of Representatives (Ddil
Eireann), in which there are now 146
deputies ; and a majority vote has ended
the long ascendancy of Eamon de
Valera.
Having won six general elections run-
ning, Mr. De Valera lost the seventh. He
has been succeeded by John Aloysius
Costello, a Dublin lawyer, of the Fine
Gael or United Ireland party, who has
become leader of an ill-assorted and pre-
carious coalition.
Fine Gael aims at union with Ulster
as “an independent member of the British
Commonwealth,” whatever that may be.
To Fianna Fail independence has already
been achieved, though, in Mr. De
Valera’s words, Eire, as an independent
republic, “is associated, as a matter of
external policy, with the States of the
British Commonwealth.” The other Re-
publican' party, Clann na Poblachta,
stands for repeal of the External Rela-
tions Act, under which “diplomatic repre-
sentatives to and from Dublin go through
the King.” This its leader, Mr. Sean
Macßride, another Dublin lawyer, an-
nounced in a letter to the “Irish Times,”
much as if Mr. Chifley declared for a
cut - the - painter policy through the
medium of “S. M. Herald.”
Yet Mr. Macßride is now Mr. Cos-
tello’s Minister of External Affairs. And
associated with him as Deputy P.M. and
Minister of Social Welfare are Mr,
Norton, leader of one of the Labor
parties; General Mulcahy, who fought
the English during “the thrubbles” as
commander of the Irish Republican
Army, and Mr. Dillon, who came out
strong for Britain and its allies during
the late war. A veritable comedy of
opposites.
The immediate cause of Mr. De
Valera’s failure in the constituencies was
the taxation of “alcohol, tobacco and
cinema seats.” It had to be done to
meet the cost of subsidies on tea (rationed
l|oz. a week), sugar (fib.) and butter
(60z.), and though it did not weaken the
“Theashoch’s” hold on the farmers, from
whom he has always drawn his main
support, it alienated many wage-earners.
Their pay is rather poor. Nor is the bold
peasantry, its country’s pride, as prosper-
ous as it hoped to become when the land
question was held to have been solved
by purchase and division into small hold-
ings, a policy begun by the old
Oppressor.
Many of the holdings are too small.
And though there is an inexhaustible
market for farm produce on the other
side of the water, there has been a decline
in numbers of pigs (“down half a mil-
lion”), cattle, sheep and poultry. Nor
has the balance been redressed by the
breeding of greyhounds for the British
market —to Britain’s loss. Britain spends
over a million a year on imports of
10,000 Irish dogs, and, of course, many
millions more on the nourishment and
training of the useless animals, on the
staffing and upkeep of courses and in
gambling on the pursuit of the tin-hare:
one cause of its own bad situation.
Ireland’s situation is not as bad as it
was when it had “a starving peasantry,
an absentee aristocracy and an alien
church,” but only an unreasoning opti-
mist, blind to the essential facts, could
pronounce it satisfactory. Government
expenditure generally exceeds revenue by
a million or two. There is a chronic ex-
cess of imports over exports —84 million
was the published figure after 11 months
of 1947. And the population is actually
declining. Reckoned at 3,160,000 in
1922, six months after the establishment
of the Free State, it had fallen to 2,949,700
at a census taken in December, 1943, and
there has been no recorded recovery
since. And, according to a “Times”
special, “there isl a steady flow of young
men and women —across the Channel” ;
emigration to the U.S.A. virtually ceased
in 1930. From the U.S.A. in 1946 came
£3,250,000 in “emigrants’ remittances and
allowances,” and from Britain £3,800,000
in pensions and allowances, the recipi-
ents being old members of the Royal
Irish Constabulary and the like ; but these
are failing sources of income.
Possibly Mr. De Valera may decide to
recruit his strength for the renewal of
the conflict of parties by Visiting Aus-
tralia. Had he come to Sydney 25 years
ago, and had Mr. Hughes allowed him to
land, he would have found the Wrongs of
Ireland still an issue in N.S.W. “Labor”
politics, with Paddy Minahan, Jack Birt,
Mick Burke and Mick Holdsworth hold-
ing forth on it in the Assembly. But those
worthies are all dead, as are most of
the Hibernians who ran the City Council
and were concerned, or some of them
were, in the first Bunnerong smell; and
the issue is dead, too —an unexpected re-
sult of the arrangement by virtue of which
the Free State came into being.
Nowadays Mr. De Valera would be
welcome as an interesting figure, and he
would find many interesting things to
make a note of and reflect on, in addition
to being privileged to exchange greetings
and reminiscences with Dr. Mannix. He
would see many members of his race in
the seats of the mighty, and might per-
haps remark that the bleak wind of criti-
cism is blowing on certain of them. In
Hobart he could learn of Mr. Cosgrove’s
extensive acquaintance with Sullivans
and of his steady dividends as a race-
course punter on an “investment” of
about £5OO a year: in Sydney, of Mr.
Ward’s indulgence to pals, two former
employees of his department —one, as
“Eddie” admitted, had the run of his
office as agent for a concession-hunter,
and the other, his political agent, was a
successful applicant for a typewriter-
import licence and in Melbourne
of at least one of the surreptitious dollar
deals of the late Dick Keane, who cut
up for so surprisingly little.
And wherever the old “Theashoch”
went he would discover that “ ‘Labor’
Governments” with a strong Irish infu-
sion in every way feed the craze for
betting, a bane of his own country, and
that lotteries comparable to the Irish
sweeps exist in “Labor” N. S. Wales,
Queensland and Tasmania, along with
industrial strife, inertia on the job, the
“what’s-the-use” spirit and under-produc-
tion. He is a reflective man, and that
would give him material for reflection.
An observant man also, Mr. De Valera
would doubtless observe that many of
the leaders of Communist unions have
Irish names, and that, with honor-
able exceptions, though few, Cabinet
Ministers and union bosses, also with
Irish names, associate with these trouble-
makers or let them go their wicked way.
From that ignoble conjunction and para-
dox his Eire, even if it has become
a backwash, “the world forgetting, by the
world forgot,” is free.
"Labor" and New Seats.
Except with new States, properly rep-
resented, as a basis, there should be no
increase in the number of Federal seats.
What Caucus plans is the rigging of
electorates so as to gain permanent office
for “Labor” and to reduce further the
proportionate voting-power of the rural
districts which do not support “Labor.”
The scheme approved last week was
decided upon at the special Con-
ference of the A.L.P. in November, 1945,
to which Mr. Chifley came for his orders.
It was embodied as the culminating reso-
lution in a group of instructions —a sort
of hormone-injection into a party which
had just been told that at the earliest
possible moment it must legislate for
bank-nationalisation, permanent control
of price-fixing by the Commonwealth, the
development of a “policy to give effect
to the party’s plans of socialisation
within the limits of the Constitution,”
and the application of “Section 10(W) of
the party constitution to introduce com-
pulsory unionism.”
It is evidence of the unfitness of the
present Government to hold office that
at the 1946 election it concealed the fact
that it was pledged to carry out these
plans, which it proceeded to implement
the moment it was returned. Nor was
anything said about the particular inten-
tion to increase the size of Parliament
when salaries were raised last session,
though everybody in Canberra knew
what was off the cards.
The opportunities for gerrymandering
presented to an Administration with
“Labor’s” record are plain after a glance
at the Census figures.
On the basis of the present population
the quota in the proposed 122-member
House of Representatives would be
about 40,000 electors, and seats may be
made to hold any number 20 per cent,
on either side of this mean—not more
than 48,000, not fewer than 32,000. Since
virtually all city and “mixed” seats
average about 72,000 electors on the
mainland (exclusive of the Northern
Territory), and the average of country
seats is under 48,000, it is obvious that
nearly all new seats may be created out
of the increased population of the city
and industrial areas, thus (the Govern-
ment no doubt hopes) producing two
Wards, Falsteins, Dalys, Haylens and
Calwells where one grew before.
The actual distribution, excluding the
N.T., appears likely to work out thus:
Present. Under New Scheme.
Big city Big city
and and
urban. Rural, urban. Rural.
N. S. Wales... 18 10 31 16
Victoria 13 7 20 13
Queensland .. 4 6 7 10
S. Australia 5 1 8 3
Westralia .... 3 2 4 4
Tasmania .... 2 3 2 3
45 29 72 49
Thus city and industrial seats, or seats
in which city areas carry the pre-
dominant vote, may increase by 27, in
which case country seats can increase by
about 20. This, however, does not tell
the full story. In South Australia two
seats may be fashioned for “Labor” by
taking areas off Barker and Wakefield.
Other country seats, by having the
country vote stripped from them —Mac-
quarie is a prime example—can be turned
into apparently safe Labor seats. And
out of the total increase of 27 seats in
city and industrial areas, 20 seem likely
to go to Sydney and Melbourne.
The Senate increase of 24 seats is as
iniquitous as that of the Representatives
is' likely to be, if not more so. The Senate
is supposedly “the Council of the States
.... enabling the States to resist, in the
legislative stage, any threatened invasion
or violation of their rights.”
If any member of the Labor majority
in the Senate now dared to advocate the
cause of the State he is supposed to
represent against the will of Caucus and
the Federal A.L.P., the bottom would
fall out of his seat. So flagrantly has
the constitution of the Senate been sub-
verted that there are now in that House
State groups of Senators—South Australia
is a revealing case in point—who flout
and oppose every point of policy of their
State Governments.
The Senate is merely, in any case, now,
a poor echo of the Lower House and its
masters, and it appears that it is to be
further prostituted by the Government
through the wholesale addition of
members in combination with the intro-
duction of proportional-representation —
expedients designed to give “Labor” a
Senate majority for five years at least
and make it impossible for any other
party to govern.
No increase in the number of mem-
bers of either House can be justified ex-
cept on the basis of regional distribution.
As things are, regions which have the
resources to be self-contained and which
have ports within a couple of hundred
miles of their furthest borders are com-
pelled to filter their produce over extrava-
gant, union-ridden railways five and six
hundred miles long so that the “capitals’
can suck the profit out of them. Rich
areas, such as the N. S. Wales North
Coast, go without hydro-electric develop-
ment, etc., for the sake of the millions
which have been poured into Sydney’s
archaic transport system and harbor
bridge. Districts which are large enough
to form separate States and have the com-
munity of interest to assure common pur-
pose in local government and Federal rep-
resentation are compelled to accept the
domination of city politicians who take
their orders from Communist-controlled
unions.
Those who framed the Constitution saw
the dangers which at present exist. Every
statesman who took part in the Conven-
tions stressed the likelihood that in time
the original States must split into smaller
States based on community of interest.
Forrest proposed that each State should
be divided into three for Senate electoral
purposes, and Isaac Isaacs concurre
The Constitution Act actually provides
an option for Queensland to operate sucfi
a system at Senate elections.
It is time there was a general sub-
division of this continent (in which, at
present, the greater bulk of the voting-
power of the chief legislature is confined
within a few hundred square miles pi
city areas), combined with a wide dis-
persal of governmental powers and a
curbing of the rising cost of government.
The whole question of regional Govern-
ments should be examined by a booy
representative not only of the Comm
wealth and the States but of region
within existing States which believe ha
they can establish local Governments of
their own and which have claims t
special Federal representation.


PLAIN ENGLISH
The Cosgrove Cose.
An eight-year Premier on trial:
In September, 1946, Thomas George de
Largie D’Alton was acquitted at Hobart on
a charge of having “corruptly solicited and
received” a gift of timber from a sawmiller
(also acquitted) when a Minister under Robert
Cosgrove. He swore that he had paid the
sawmiller in a Hobart street out of money
kept in his Ministerial office “for racing pur-
poses.”
Now, after a fortnight’s trial, Cosgrove
has himself been acquitted at Hobart on
14 charges two each of bribery and con-
spiracy, six of corruption. All related to
payments of £5400 alleged to have been made
to him in six half-yearly parcels of banknotes
by John Thomas Sullivan, for himself and
others, and intended for party funds (though
this had not been mentioned in a statement
signed 'by Sullivan and read in the Assembly),
to secure the preservation of their road-
transport businesses, private road transport
being under a “Labor” threat of nationalisation.
In evidence-in-chief and cross-examination
Sullivan stuck to the story of the payments
he had told at the royal-commission inquiry,
which was halted by Justice Reed’s recommen-
dation of a prosecution. Cosgrove, while ad-
mitting the existence of a special party fund
exclusively under his personal control, except
for banking assistance rendered by Miss Dart,
his secretary, who mentioned deposits after
Cosgrove wins at the -races, denied having
received any money from Sullivan. That per-
son had called on him at Hobart with an
objection to being taxed for carriage of news-
papers, at Launceston with a protest against
the granting of licences to Ansetts, and at
Hobart again, being then “annoyed and very
sullen,” concerning a second issue of Ansett
licences. On that occasion, October 28, 1947,
Sullivan asked “Would three thousand be
any good to the party to leave us alone?”
His reply was in the negative, and he “got
up and showed Sullivan out,” afterwards re-
porting the incident to colleagues.
Some of the Sullivdn meetings noted in the
Premier’s appointment-book were, Cosgrove
proceeded, with other and unrelated Sullivans,
one of whom was dead. A sum of £9lO in
a safe-deposit box at the Commonwealth Bank
came from a grocery business which he had
sold to Archie Woolston in 1937 after losses
in the three preceding years. On that score
there was “a dispute,” but he didn’t know
whether Woolston had threatened proceedings,
though “we settled on Woolston’s terms,”
taking £5OO off the price. A four-years improve-
ment of £1350 in his capital assets—from £7OOO-
- brought about by salary savings and
wagers, his punting profits being £lOO a year.
Purchase of a car for £675 in banknotes on
October 4, 1946, was a sequel to a cash repay-
ment of a loan of £7OO by Syd Weaving, to
whom and to other members of the Weaving
family h* had lent money from time to time.
The car-money came out of the safe-deposit
box, and Cosgrove was closely examined by
Crown Solicitor Gibson on visits to his par-
ticular repository of “Labor’s” secret weapon,
or whatever it may be called. Yes, it was a
fact that in one week of December, 1945, Sulli-
van visited him and he visited the box, withal
making deposits of £4OO and £4O; but there
was no connection between visits and deposits.
The £4OO came from Monty Biggins, and
another £440, deposited in June, 1947, from
“George Fitzpatrick, of Sydney, who is in-
terested in Tasmania and has a fair amount
of business here.” The nature of George’s
business was not revealed.
Discharging an invidious job faithfully and
fearlessly, Mr. Gibson put it to the jury that
“the record of Cosgrove’s visits to his safe-
deposit fits in with Sullivan’s account of the
dates on which he paid the money,” £4OOO of
it received from “three hardheaded businessmen
without the scratch of a pen.” Mr. Sholl, for
Cosgrove, pointed out that the Crown case
rested on the evidence of “a self-confessed
accomplice in a grave crime,” and asked the
panel to reject it and remember Cosgrove’s
30 years’ service to the State—was it conceiv-
able that “he would put that record in the
hands of a man like Sullivan, who would have
the drop on him for all time?”
Having intervened in an argument with
the words “I cannot allow this trial to be
presented to the jury as a political trial,” Chief
Justice Morris delivered an able summing-up.
The jury retired for two hours and returned
with a 10-2 majority for Cosgrove. Tasmanian
criminal law admits of majority verdicts; in
N. S. Wales, as the Official Year-Book puts
it, “if unanimity is not reached within twelve
hours the jury is discharged.”
When Justice Reed returned his royal com-
mission with the recommendation that Sullivan
and his associates be pardoned and Cosgrove
prosecuted, Cosgrove, with Caucus sanction,
handed over the Premiership to Mr. Brooker.
He expects to regain it, but he cannot fairly
hold it or any other position in the Cabinet
without the approval of the people, registered
at a general election. A general election should
be held at the earliest possible moment. To
‘ Labor” there can be no honorable alternative,
especially as proportional representation forbids
by-elections—one of its cardinal weaknesses,
and in this case, fatal.

Carnival at Canberra.
Commonwealth motor-cars are by no
means rare sights in city streets, at surf
beaches, golf clubs and holiday resorts
these days. And far too many of their
drivers apparently assume that being
Commonwealth employees renders them
above State traffic laws. Even in Can-
berra their misuse was a bit too hot for
the A.C.T. Advisory Committee, whose
A. T. Shakespeare demanded a halt the
other day.
Fifty Government vehicles and hundreds
of number-plates had disappeared Gov-

“Extremely exaggerated,” snorted the
responsible Minister, Mr. Johnson, who
was extremely evasive, but promised to
make a “thorough investigation.”
Ordinary taxpaying motorists were still
thinking it over when the Commonwealth
Auditor-General’s report for 1946-47 was
tabled in Parliament.
It noted, with what astonishment may
be supposed, that Government cars had
multiplied by seven—2oo in 1939, 1400
in June, 1947—and contained a few
pertinent remarks:
Many officials did not fully realise the
need for economy.... Audit reports in-
dicated the need to consider curtailing
expense on motor-transport in all depart-
ments The large number of cars allotted
lor exclusive use by individual officers is
particularly noticeable... .Many cases of
inadequate records of running and main-
tenance costs... .There is need for a com-
pete review of expenditure by independent
officers to reduce the numbers of cars, in-
cluding those allotted to individuals and to
maintain a more rigid control of costs.
It followed hard upon the voices of
Mr. Chifley and Senator Ashley, the one
urging all hands to save petrol to con-
serve dollars, the other full of threats to
private motorists that their petrol ration
would be cut unless “petrol rackets”
ceased. “War expenditure has engendered
a disregard for economy,” said the
Auditor-General. Obviously true ; and

enjoy at the expense of the taxpayer,
careless alike of public opinion and the
so-called authority of the hopeless mob
which calls itself the Commonwealth
Government!
Roars in "Roaring Forties."
It was never likely that the British cruiser
Nigeria sent from Capetown to give “all
necessary support” to the Governor of
the Falkland Islands and dependencies
would start a shooting-match with Chilean
or Argentine navies or landing parties on
the fringe of the Antarctic continent.
Primarily President Perdn of Argentina
was made by the daily press the villain
of the piece. Later he was said to be
unable, owing to pressure of business, to
keep an appointment with the Chilean
President in those frozen latitudes. Still*
later he had two cruisers and six de-
stroyers on the way to the Antarctic.
The recent Anglo-Argentine trade agree-
ment is much more important to both
parties than a quarrel over rights in a
hut on Deception Island, where two
British sailors were guarding scientific
instruments.
Meanwhile the Chilean Navy, “awfully
arrayed” and carrying President Videla,
his Army Chief-of-Staff, and his Admiral-
Commanding, landed at another South
Shetland camp, on Greenwich Island,
manned for the past 12 months by a
Chilean “garrison.” There President
Videla, invoking the might of “all
America,” warned “antiquated European
imperialists” to “keep 6ut of the Ant-
arctic,” Whereafter he sailed again for
the shore of Grahamsjand (to be re-
christened in the name of O’Higgins), in
order to plant the Chilean flag—also pos-
sibly to avoid the Nigeria. The only re-
action so far has been a Washington
official comment that if President Videla
is counting on U.S. backing he must guess
again.
In this region below the “roaring
forties” the first Argentine bellowings fol-
lowed upon rejection of a British Note
suggesting that the International Court
should decide the dispute about ownership.
“Reason” was that acceptance “would
conflict with Argentine’s agreement with
Chile for joint action.” The plain truth
is that Peron will not risk an adverse de-
cision at The Hague, but that the oppor-
tunity to cock a snook at Britain is, as
the “Times” correspondent reports, “a
windfall for the Peron Government on
the eve of elections next month for one-
half the Chamber of Deputies.”
In the same way Panama the other
day tore up an agreement to allow the
American Government to maintain air-
bases in defence of the canal zone. For
five minutes it all looked very blood-
thirsty and self-assertive. But Panama
also has elections approaching—for Presi-
dent, in May. After those are over, it is
expected that Panama will have second
thoughts and that the agreement which
General Marshall wanted will be revived.
It's BAD to be British.
The Oliviers are coming with the Old
Vic. Company to play “Richard III,”
“The School for Scandal” and a con-
temporary play, and, unless fetors’
Equity can stop them, they will appear in
Sydney, It will be an experience for
a great many people, not all of them
young, to see good flesh-and-bood
shows. And out of even a brief season
the impressionable will learn something.
The Australian theatre in its great days
was an influence for manners as well as
culture. To many a girl in particular
gracious and accomplished women like
Mrs. Brough, Nellie Stewart and Marie
Tempest were a liberal education in de-
portment and diction. In these years
what passes with the young for culture
and manners and the management of the
human voice is imparted by radio
“personalities” who shout or gabble at the
rate of 150 words a minute, and by film
girls “elevated to stardom” from
the cool-drink shop or the “haberdash.”
Actors’ Equity is claimed by the Com-
munists as one of their own string of
unions. Its threats concerning companies
sponsored by the British Council —the
Ballet Rambert as well as the Old Vic.
combination—and its attacks on George
Formby certainly suggest ape-like Com-
munist inspiration. It made a special prey
of Formby when that “alien” (its own
description) refused to join, denounc-
ing him at the end of his tour for
saying that the Australian stage had gone
stale as it has, though “mouldy”
would ba a more appropriate term —and
ending with the foul allegation that
Formby had refused to help the Food
for Britain appeal on the ground that
“British workers” were “not worth work-
ing for.” This of a man who was a
British worker himself and who, though
a martyr to sinus trouble, spared neither
his person nor his pocket in war-time
service—for one thing he gave £lO,OOO to
the Navy Replacement Fund.
The foul allegation was made in the
names of Hal Alexander, the secretary,
and Hal Lashwood, a vice-president and
radio “comedian.” These fellows were
given the lie by Formby, who detailed
what he had done to get food for Britain
by personal appearances and purchases,
all adding up to a splendid contribution ;
and George Foster, himself a councillor
of Actors’ Equity, said he didn’t believe
a word of their story:
I know from personal knowledge that
George and Beryl Formby did a great deal
for the Food for Britain fund. For ex-
ample, they bought 1100 parcels and sent
them to England. They were the last
civilians out of Dunkirk and the first in at
the Normandy landing. Montgomery himself
praised them, in an affidavit. I and other
ex-servicemen know of the years this man
put in, risking his neck, not on £lOBO a
week [a chronic Lash wood grievance],
which was taxed more than £7OO, but
possibly on a salary lower than that earned
by Mr. Lashwood during the same period.
A shrewd and well-deserved thrust.
And Actors’ Equity must have members
of the same mind as Mr. Foster, now
himself under threat. He and they
should exert themselves to deliver it from
its present control, change the venomous
anti-British policy and secure for their
profession, as well as the public, the ad-
vantages that will assuredly flow from
periodical visits to Australia by repre-
sentative overseas artists and companies.
"Thou Shalt Not Work."
Paternalism gone mad is the only way
to describe the case in which a Sydney
cabinetmaker was fined 10s., with 7s.
costs, “for opening a factory after 1 p.m.
on a Saturday.” He is the owner of a
one-man furniture factory, using no
labor but his own, but is regarded for
the purposes of the Factories and Shops
Act as having one employee.
An ex-officer of the A.1.F., he repairs
and modernises furniture. On a fateful
Saturday afternoon last October he was
in his workshop repairing a wooden tray
belonging to his sister. According to his
story, he was waiting for two friends to
call and was whiling away the time by
putting new handles on the tray. He
heard a knock at the door, assumed his
friends had arrived, and opened the door.
In walked an inspector of the Depart-
ment of Labor and Industry and a furni-
ture trade-union official: representative
of two figures that have become all-too-
familiar features of the Australian scene
—the paid Government interferer and
the union official who seems to regard
the sight of work-in-progress as a chal-
lenge to him to have it stopped. Whether
the two were working overtime or whether
their 40-hour .week had been so arranged
as to permit Saturday-afternoon work
was not stated, but they were able in due
course to testify that they had caught
the defendant red-handed.
In inflicting the fine, Mr. A. G.
Morgan, Chief Industrial Magistrate,
said:
Everybody knows that before hours were
strictly policed this and other industries
were in the doldrums. It is just one of
the things we have to put up with if the
Act catches up in its net people like the
defendant, who was apparently doing no
harm.
“We have to put up with”? An Act
of Parliament is only enforced through
the medium of human agents—in this
case a Government inspector, a trade-
union official and a magistrate. If one
or all of them can administer the Act
so unwisely or unhappily as to prompt
the remark quoted, then there must be
sqmething wrong with the Act. No
matter how worthy the motives behind
a law, if its effect is to penalise a man
for “doing no harm” it is bad law and
due for reform.
The man whose Saturday-afternoon
lawbreaking was the subject of the in-
formation was quoted as saying: “It is
a sorry state of affairs when a man can’t
work in his own factory.” It is truly
a sorry state when, in a country whose
biggest problem is a superabundance of
people who don’t want to work, a man
can be fined for wanting to do so.
Cold Feet at U.N.O.
It has taken the U.N.O. Palestine Com-
mission (drawn from Bolivia, Czecho-
slovakia, Denmark, Panama and the
Philippines) three months to appreciate
the warning given on its appointment
that its task in the Much-Promised Land
would be hopeless without force to back
up its authority. Now U.N.O. head-
quarters are “awakening to the dangers
of partition,” and the American Govern-
ment is showing signs of a change of
mind.
Dr. Evatt, on return from steering the
partition scheme through the U.N.O.
committee over which he presided,
lauded the work as showing that “the
Assembly could do things.” Leaving
aside the manner in which it did this
thing—the lobbying for the votes of
Haiti and Liberia to get the requisite
majority; the pressure of Jewish influ-
ence to an extent which led the “Times”
to observe that in any other place but
New York the Arab leaders’ arguments
would have killed partition stone-dead—
what did the Assembly in fact achieve
except to fix the date of the open season
for Jewish-Arab conflict?
Meanwhile there have been two repre-
sentations to the Security Council, de-
liberately by-passed as impotent in the
original U.N.O. procedure. One is from
the Palestine Commission itself, calling

upon the Council “to supply promptly
adequate military forces.” Presumably,
when the Council does not oblige, mem-
bers of the Commission will resign their
appointment. The other was from the
Jewish Agency, whose whole post-war
campaign in Palestine has been based on
violence and terrorism, indicting the
Arabs for attempts to “defeat partition
by force” and “threatening a breach of
the peace.” And, in face of their own
persistent attempts for months past to
smuggle shiploads of arms and gunmen
into Palestine, the Jewish Agency has
given notice of another protest charging
the British Government with being a
party to “the grave and singular feature”
of purchases of arms abroad by the
Arabs.
The balloon goes up on May 15, when
the British mandate will end on Britain’s
initiative and the British military ad-
ministration will be withdrawn. The
U.K. forces will gradually leave during
the ensuing three months. They will not
during the interim police the country for
the U.N.O. Commission. Then will be
fully revealed what Dr. Evatt recently
described as “the wise determination of
the [U.N.O.] Assembly to make its
recommendations without being intimi-
dated by threats of violence.”
POLITICAL POINTS
“We don’t want to fight, but, Nigeria,
if we d 0”,...
If Actors’ Equity lets the Old Vic. com-
pany put on “King Richard III” jn Aus-
tralia, “Labor” politicians and palsi—
or some “Labor” politicians and pals—
should make a point of attending. It’s
the play in which there is that grand
line “A horse! A horse! My kingdom
for a horse!”
At the beginning of the week Queens-
land was still without Government rail-
way trains, though, as before, it was
carrying on with road and car services:
modem communities are to a large ex-
tent independent of railway strikes,
whether directed by Communists or other
union larrikins. The Industrial Court had
had the parties before it, with no im-
mediate effect. Some people expected the
Court to order a ballot of all railway
unions on the question of resumption.
The Hanlon Government, for its part,
refuses to capitulate to Communists.
Hanlon could profit by the example of
Hollway, who, in a similar situation, hit
hard at Communists and won.
The Cosgrove case should be followed
by.a general Assembly election, and will
if Dr. Turnbull crosses the floor. An
election of both Houses would be pre-
ferable, especially as D’Alton, of the
dog-racing “bank,” has become an
MI.C., but the Council cannot be dis-
solved.
Chifley’s “prices, rents and charges”
referendum is to be taken on May 29.
Almost 35 years to the day since “Labor”
asked for full powers to control (1) cor-
porations, (2) industrial matters, (3)
nationalisation of monopolies, (4) trade
and commerce, (5) railway disputes and
(6) trusts. It failed of majorities on all
six questions in N. S. Wales, Victoria and
Tasmania and in the general voting.
On the last lap of Dedman’s return
journey from Cuba, the N.S.W. and Vic-
torian Governments simultaneously
abandoned his “policy” of refusing to
provide “homes for little capitalists.”
“Housing Commission dwellings will be
easier to buy under new laws now in
preparation,” said Warner, the Victorian
Housing Minister, and his opposite num-
ber in Sydney, Dr. Evatt’s brother, capped
this by announcing that “there will be
no limit on the number of Housing Com-
mission homes to be sold to tenants.”
No comment on the offers of homes to
“little capitalists” has come from Ded-
man or his offsider Coombs. Coombs,
in May, 1944, promised to effect a ver-
itable “revolution in the antiquated
house-building industry.” He allowed
that it would “take us” (the Dedman-
Coombs outfit) “two years to catch up
on the shortage, though we are planning
a building programme twice as big as in
the best pre-war years.”
A.R.U.A.F.U.L.E. Gibe written by a
half-wit on a wall? No ; contraction of
the names of two unions which held a
joint meeting at Maryborough to dis-
cuss the Queensland railway stoppage.
“Courier-Mail” completes the story:
A.R.U. withdrew and decided to endorse
the decision to declare all trains “black.”
A.F.U.L.E. by a two-to-one majority re-
affirmed its resolution to give the matter
i further consideration before becoming more
actively engaged in the dispute.
So A.R.U. was the F.U.L.E.
New York, with a population of
14.000. sends two Senators and 45
Representatives to Washington, and it
can claim no more Senators than Alaska
will have if that territory (population
80.000, and little more than half whites)
becomes a State, on President Truman’s
recommendation. If “Labor” has its way,
Tasmania will have five Ms.H.R. and 10
Senators. What a travesty, especially as
parts of Australia with many more people
than Tasmania —New England and the
Riverina —will have no one to speak for
them in the Senate,
In the first (1901-03) House of Repre-
sentatives, N. S, Wales had 26 members,
Victoria 23, Queensland nine, S.A. seven,
Westralia and Tasmania five each. Now
“Labor” has decided on 47 members for
N. S. Wales, 33 for Victoria, 18 for
Queensland, 10 for S.A., eight for West-
ralia and five for the Speck. And in
N. S. Wales, Victoria, S.A. and the West,
city members will predominate—they
nowhere did in 1901-03. It will be a
monstrous business if it comes off, and
whether it comes off or not, active pro-
testing country movements, with nasty
separatist tendencies if thwarted, may be
expected.
Sydney “D.T.” was first in with the
announcement that “the State Govern-
ment intends to open three or four coal-
mines which will have an estimated out-
put of 3,500,000 tons a year.” That will
be about a third of the annual output
from 90 existing mines. Baddeley, who
is for “giving the workers everything
they ask for,” has cast himself for the
part of magician and is sure to get “the
bird.”
That uncomfortable bedfellow the
Commonwealth Statistician reports that
in December the number of Australians
working for Governments and for
semi-Govemment bodies increased by
3000 to 574,000, the Chifley mob tak-
ing on most of them. At this rate it
won’t be long before Calwell has to ap-
peal for “migrants” so that Government
“servants” may have people to order
about.
Queensland retailers are dead against
handing over permanent price-control to
Canberra. What States like-Queensland
want is some form of permanent control
of Canberra,
Mournfully announcing a loss of
£1,611,554 in 1946-47, the S.A. Railways
Commissioner went on to mention what
“the principal effect of the 40-hour week”
would be —“an increase in costs of not
less than £2,300,000 a year compared
with 1937-38.” He should seek out Arbi-
tration Judge Foster, who said, the
national economy could well afford the
cost of the 40-hour week, and offer to
swap jobs.
Illustrative of the decay of Parliament
undeif socialist rule was the treatment of
a question (Menzies to Chifley) asking
when the report of the committee of
privilege on the Mulcahy defamation of
Blain would be presented. The Speaker
ruled the question out of order because,
he said, it could be addressed only to the
chairman of the committee, Dr. Evatt,
who was absent. Too right he was ab-
sent, and he will remain absent for
weeks, perhaps But that amends
to a soldier M.P. for dastardly and false
aspersions against his honor should be
delayed or denied on.such a technicality
outrages all Parliamentary traditions.
Any Victorian passing the Housing
Commission estate at Northcote would
be impressed by the quantity of bricks
on the huge area sequestrated by the
Cains, but not by the quantity of labor —
four men were counted on a recent morn-
ing. Victoria’s housing programme has
been almost at a standstill since the New
Year because of lack of cement, caused
by lack of coal. Builders with contracts
for 20 houses are getting two bags a
week. Cement is, of course, on Chifley’s
list of exports to dollar areas.
A year ago when the price of bricks in
N. S. Wales was raised 10s. a thousand
by permission of one of our multitude of
masters, Minister Cahill crowed that the
Government brickworks had been so suc-
cessful that he wouldn’t “follow the lead
of private companies and increase the
price.” There was an election pending.
That hurdle cleared, the price of Gov-
ernment bricks was “upned” 7s. and then
35., bringing it to the same level as the
“exploiters’ ” price, despite the fact that
the Government show pays no taxes
and is not required to show profits. Just
after that the Prices Commissioner
allowed a further increase of 75., and the
State works nearly burst a kiln in its
haste to grab the seven bob. In the
mordant phrase of Building Industry
Congressman Fraser, “the ‘Government’
feels the hot breath of its 40-hour week
on its own neck.”
Waterfront Communists permitting,
9,000,000 gallons of motor spirit from
Sumatra will be unloaded at Australian
ports before the end of March. That’s a
lot of petrol. On the basis of recent
figures it’s enoughs to keep 180 youths of
19 in luxury for one month.
Last week The Bulletin felt tempted
to republish its “I’ll Fight Any Woman
in the Crowd” cartoon, with Calwell as
the central figure. This was after Cal-
well’s characteristic rant when taken to
task by Spender and Abbott for insisting
on the recall of the 50 Australian girls
working for the U.S. forces in the
Pacific and on the turning in of their
small dollar savings, reduced by payment
of “Labor’s” bloodsucking taxes. “In the
matter of service in a foreign army,” Cal-
well blustered, “these women! have no
rights,” to which Holt replied with an un-
answered question, “Is punching a type-
writer service in a foreign army?” A
day or two later it came out that Cal-
well had strained the conventions and
spent public money to get the Communist
ruffian Sharkey a passport and reluctant
Indian Government permission for
attendance at a Communist conference,
an evident preliminary to the launching
of a Cominform in this part of the
world. Where Reds are concerned Cal-
well and his crowd are yellow.
Cripps told the Commons last week
that his Government had no intention of
sanctioning the proposed £2OOO million
lottery. Though it has got its country
into a mess, it hasn’t fallen so low as to
resort to an expedient rejected over a
century ago in Britain for good and
sufficient reasons. It is content to leave
that sort of thing to Eire, Russia (which
has “scaled” holders of scrip in lottery
loans) and Australian “ ‘Labor’ Govern-
ments.”
Commissioner Canny claims an all-
time record •in rail transport of
1947-48 Victorian wheat, despite coal
shortages and cessation of goods services.
A facer for the A.R.U. Communist
. Brown, who early in the season came out
with the exultant announcement that the
department would be incapable of hand-
ling the harvest.
Under instructions from the familiar
quarter, and alleging a projected coup
d’etat, also the presence of “a flood of
spies from the West,” Communists at
Prague have forced “a Cabinet crisis,”
and 12 non-Communist Ministers are out,
doubtless fingering the backs of their
necks. Benes, the old President, will join
them unless he agrees to remain as the
complete toady to Moscow. The Aus-
tralian and N.Z. “Labor” Governments
have let his “republic” have whole
cargoes of wool on credit. Perhaps they
will be offered “payment” in Russian
roubles of the lately-discarded issue,
worth about tuppence a ton for waste.
Maoriland is withdrawing its Minister
from Moscow on the ground that he is
costing too much and can do nothing
useful.. That applies to Australia as
well, but the head of the Australian staff
at Moscow has been named Ambassador,
as also have the heads of the Australian
staffs at Paris and Chungking. One ex-
cuse is that these worthies must have the
diplomatic status of “permanent members
of the Security Council.” Why should
they, when Australia is not a permanent
member of that body and has ceased to
be a temporary member? It is in part
megalomania and in part squandermania ;
the feeding of forms of vanity which
are ill-timed and out of place.
Comments by Sir George Aylwen,
Sheriff of the City of London in 1946-47,
on population trends in N.Z. as observed
during a two months’ stay prompted the
“Dominion” to publish figures:
In 1936, 40.32 p.c. of the people lived
in the country; in 1945, 36.81 p.c. In 1901
South Island and North Island populations
were equal; in 1945 67.34 p.c. inhabited the
North. Increases in actual numbers 1936-
45 were 128,488 North, 25 South.
The visitor warned the Dominion against
giving overmuch attention to urban in-
dustries with a doubtful survival-value
to the neglect of the land industries.
In 1946-47, as Chifley has admitted,
“Australia received about 190 million
dollars and spent about 290 million,”
and his crowd came on hard-pressed
Britain for the difference, as it is still
doing. And no small part of the dif-
ference went and is going in the pur-
chase of planes for T.-A.A. (first year’s
loss £500,000), of a fleet of Buicks for
Ministers and associates, of a host of
cars and accessories for Government
“servants” and in dollar credits for Ward,
Amour, Drakeford, Parry, Goldberg
and the rest. It was like Chifley to ask
“business firms and individual citizens to
go carefully with all forms of dollar ex-
penditure” and so “help.” Straightway
there arrived one of several U.S, pugs
consigned to Wren’s Stadium, ea,ch to be
privileged to take away the dollar
equivalent of a thousand pounds.
A misguided enthusiast who wrote to
the Melbourne dailies suggesting that
Victorian Parliamentary debates should
be broadcast got a cold reply from Holl-
way. The Premier said he, for one,
didn’t want to compete with Canberra
even if A.B.C. were agreeable, and he
doubted whether any Victorian com-
mercial station was ready to bore the
public any more than it was bored
already.
As fugacious as time itself are the pre-
election promises of “Labor” politicians.
Like McGirr in N. S. Wales, Gair in
Queensland once roared about what he
would do to traders who didn’t deliver
goods to homes, McGirr has repudiated
his undertaking. Gair has made a sort
of a kind of appeal to Queensland shop-
keepers to consider the poor housewife.
As if “Labor” ever did!
Fuller (Hume), Langtry (Riverina) and
Fraser (Eden-Monaro) were observed,to
be somewhat abstracted when the House
met. At Henty there had been formed
a branch of the United Women’s Citi-
zen Movement Against Socialisation —
the 42nd in the trio’s territory.

“Orion”; After nearly four years of
dispute and litigation, the case initiated
against the Bishop of Bathurst by 23
communicants of the diocese has been
decided in the Equity Court of N.S.W.
The suit was, in due form, brought
by the Attorney-General of the State on
the relation of the complainants, who
objected that the Bishop was using a
certain rubric in administering the sacra-
ment of Holy Communion, which was an
illegal addition to the order of the Prayer
Book of the Church of England, and also
that he used certain illegal ceremonies in
accordance with a “Red Book” to which
complainants objected. The charge was
that these usages were in breach of a
trust upon which churches of the diocese
were held. The case lingered for a year
or two while the Bishop objected that the
original plaint was laid wrongly by the
Solicitor-General instead of by the

The Full Court, on appeal, ruled against

his defence that the things complained
of were “matters of internal regulation,”
proper for hearing only by the Synod of
the Diocese. These delaying actions be-
ing over, and evidence having been taken
in England, the real cause of action came
on for hearing before Roper, J., in the
Equity Court last September, and his
judgment, now delivered, decides that the
Bishop’s practices are contrary to the
rules of Church of England in Australia.
Injunction was granted against the Bishop
from using or authorising any order of
service other than that prescribed in the
prayer-book, and the Bishop was ordered
to pay costs, including one half of the
costs of taking evidence in England.

“Chev”: Probably the first stoppage
on Melbourne wharves which had an
esthetic basis occurred recently. Wharfies
and seamen dropped their hands and
stared in speechless admiration at the
yachtlike lines, clipper bows, neat low
funnel and chaste colors of the Swedish-
Australian motor-ship Nimbus as she
sailed up the Yarra. She is the latest
product of Swedish shipbuilding, and her
internal decorations are .on a par with
her outside appearance. The 12 pas-
sengers she carries occupy luxurious single
cabins and her saloon is fitted up like
an old Swedish tavern. She is first of
four ships to be named after cloud for-
mations, which apparently are the same in
Swedish as in English.

“Cauboy”; Victorian local-option
people were stirred to action recently
when A. O. Mendelssohn, city analyst
and composer, remarked at a Rotary
luncheon that Bernard Shaw was
the only living first-class creative tee-
totaller. The Rev. McCue
retorted that he could fill a book with
the names of famous t.ts., and cited
Field-Marshal Montgomery, Isaac Isaacs
and Abraham Lincoln as shining ex-
amples who could be coupled with Shaw
as never having indulged in a hard drink.
Unfortunately none of them is or was a
creative individual, Gandhi was a tee-,
totaller, but he was more of a saint than
a genius. The saints, generally speaking,
have been averse to liquor; geniuses
usually haven’t. Michelangelo was a
genius but not a saint. Franz Hals lived
in a pub and seldom went to bed sober,
but he certainly painted great pictures.
Shaw is a genius and not a saint, and he
is also a teetotaller, so he appears to be
the great exception. But he has said that,
although he is a t.t., he couldn’t prove
that he would not have done better if, like
Edmund Kean, he had lived on brandy.

“Rupert”; An illuminating comment
on Australian newspapers and their
public has been given by a radio an-
nouncer. With appropriate fanfares the
subject of the quiz was announced as
“Comic Strip Characters.” “This,” said
the announcer, “will show us the people
who read their papers.” The only
character to stump the contestants was
the leading villain in an Australian strip.
On American gangsters and unsavory
moonshiners the quiz wbnders could not
be faulted. Later in the programme some
genius credited “Ode to a Grecian Urn”
to Robert Louis Stevenson. I switched
off.
* * * *
“Nakh”; Scientific amenities have their
drawbacks. A few years ago the papers
were full of cases of householders be-
ing electrocuted through faulty electric
appliances. No sooner had the public
been educated into dealing with this
menace than home radio began to take
its toll of sybarites who, after preparing
a hot bath, sat down in it and reached for
the wireless. The new pressure-cooker
seems to be in for its turn. A case was
recently reported in Melbourne of a
young housewife having been scalded on
the arms and face through disregard of
the instructions issued with every pres-
sure-cooker. Lifting the lid only a little
to peep at the rhubarb she became a
cot-case; the doctor attending remarked
that if the pressure had been greater she
might have lost her eyesight. One can’t
help feeling envious of the monotonous
security enjoyed by the cavemen, who
merely had to share their domiciles with
the woolly rhinoceros and the sabre-
toothed tiger.

“B. A. Ker”: The Welsh have long
regarded their football as of secondary
importance to nothing except
on equal terms with their piety (“Eons,”
B. 21/1 /’4B). I fancy it was in 1908
when England, playing the Taffies in their
“ You'd better carry him, Oswald, he's getting cross and tired.”
own backyard, was leading by two points
with a few minutes to play. Suddenly
a rich baritone burst forth with heart-
felt fervor: “Oh, God, Our Help in Ages
Past.” Like a breaking wave the voices
joined in all around the ground until the
stands rocked with the supplication. And,
inspired by faith in Divine intervention,
or merely moved by such an overwhelm-
ing display “‘of patriotism, Wales swept
down the field to score the winning try.
Ten minutes later every loyal Welshman

“Thirsty Ted”; Why worry about the
beer shortage? I once saw a bloke get
gloriously drunk by eating a dozen pies
in quick succession. How do I know he
was drunk? Well, no sober individual
gets out of a warm bed in the middle of
a frosty night to recite poetry at the
top of his voice. Of course, next morn-
ing he denied all knowledge of the inci-
dent ; but, like all boozers, vowed “never

“Melbn”: Sale of Howey House, on
the Block, Collins-street, for the record
price of £3600 a foot, is a reminder of
Melbourne’s first land sale when, stepping
on to a fallen log, almost on the spot
which Batman pointed out as a good
place for a village, city surveyor Robert
Hoddle made the stipulation that the
buyer of Melbourne’s future Golden Acre
must put down a deposit of 40 shillings
and within two years put up a substantial
dwelling worth at least £2O. The lot was
knocked down to Batman, who was
dreadfully disgruntled when he heard that
his rival Fawkner had bought an adjoin-
ing block for £32. The proceeds of that
sale, £3532, wouldn’t buy one foot of
the soil which was knocked down for
£l5O to Henry Howey, a farmer, when
he came in with a friend to the second
sale five months later. His friend was
convinced that Williamstown was destined
to be the future capital and bought a
block there for £2OO, It is still worth
£2OO.

“C. 8.”: Touching the projected im-
mortalising of Mr. Chifley’s features, I am
reminded of the American millionaire
who was asked what procedure he
adopted when he commissioned artists to
paint his picture. “Well,” he said, “when
I stay at a hotel I always order twelve
eggs for breakfast in hopes of getting
one fresh one, I order portrait painters
in the same way.”
* * * •
“Myrrhee”; “Ex-C.G.” guesses cor-
rectly that the term “dro’ngo” as an
alternative to “no-hoper” had its origin
in the Scobie horse of that name (B.
14/1/’4B). It is extremely doubtful
whether Drongo’s name would have sur-
vived the early ’twenties if it hadn’t
been for Melbourne “Herald” cartoonist
Wells’s fondness, over a long period
’tween wars, for labelling any unsuccess-
ful racehorse “Drongo.” lie really de-
serves the credit for adding a colorful
piece of slang to the language.

“Gravelsnatcher”: A Westralian whal-
ing company has bought half a dozen
anti-tank guns—sorry, tank-attack guns.
Their monicker was changed to infuse
a more aggressive spirit into the troops,
and was supposed to indicate that the
Allies had gone over to the offensive,
The incentive was never necessary.
When, on the way back from the Middle
East, we had a sub.-alarm and no escort,
it was a Boyes anti-tank rifle that we
mounted, slung between two ropes
fastened above and below. With a good
gun crew and a shipful of enthusiastic
spotters and rangefinders, we hurled de-
fiance at the unseen foe and rather hoped
he’d show up. The idea, if I remember
rightly, was to disable his conning-tower,
rake his decks and sink him with a well-
placed shot amidships. The duel didn’t
eventuate, and a lot of bets were called
off.

current and old, operating-signal instruc-
tions and interrogation of all hands failed
to furnish a due to its meaning. The

craft landed and the operator laconically
explained that it was a request for four

stations where the abbreviation was
widely known!

“S.S.”: When I was a kid we used to
save matchbox tops, photos of cricketers,
cigarette-cards, etc. The other day I
encountered two bright young sparks
each with a wooden cart containing
empty spirit-bottles, mainly whisky. One
kid was displaying a bottle with the air of
a connoisseur. “Look at this one,” he
was saying. “Real Scotch-whisky bottle ;
label not torn, cork in good condition,
no chips.” The other nodded his head
appraisingly. “Reckon you might get a
deener for that,” he said. “A shilling?”
I queried. “Who’re you selling them to?”
“Mr, Blank,” they replied. Mr. Blank
is one of those characters who can get
you anything from nylons to “genuine”
Scotch whisky.

“Jasby’s” car has a personal grievance:
About three months ago I bought a second-
hand car in Melbourne and applied to the
Fuel Board for a permit for 25 gallons of
petrol to get it back to Sydney. I was treated
courteously, given forms to fill in, a J.P. was
produced on tha premises to witness my
statutory declaration. I waited 10 minutes; then
the clerk brought the papers back endorsed
“application refused.” He explained that no
special permit could be issued in those circum-
stances for a second-hand car. Had the bus
been new it would have been all right, but
a second-hand car, no. Unable to see the
logic of this ruling I posed the question, “Do
you mean to. say that if a man bought a new
car in Perth he could get sufficient fuel to
run it to his home in Townsville?” “Yes, I
suppose so,” was the reply. “And yet you
can’t grant 25 gallons to take a second-hand
car to Sydney?” “No.” After further dis-
cussion he disappeared behind a screen again
and came back with a generous offer —the De-
partment was prepared to allow me to draw
three months’ petrol in advance. That would
get me to Sydney. “And then I lock the car
up for three months, I suppose?” He was
sorry, but that was all they could suggest.
I explained the position to the car, and being
an understanding vehicle —age had taught it a
lot —it got me back to Sydney without benefit
of Fuel Board, but it was simply ropeable last
week when it read of a Sydney youth of 19
who in the past few months had been issued
by the Fuel Board with coupons for 115,000
gallons of petrol for non-existent vehicles.
“Look here,” the old bus said to me, “this lad
didn’t have to make any statutory declarations;
didn’t even have to produce his registration
papers; yet they gave him just about a shiP"
load. I’ve worked it out on my speedo. That
juice would have taken me nearly 3,000,0 w
miles —allowing for a bit of coasting down the
other side of the world, something like
times round the Equator.” I pointed out to
the old flivver that the youth had had to pay
for his crime; he had been given 12 months in
jail. “Twelve months!” it snorted. Whats
that? They expected you to lock me up tor
three months just for being honest,”
ORDINARY BLOKES.
“In a House of Lords debate on Labor’s latest
proposals for the further clipping of the powers of
that body, it was suggested by one peer, a distin-
guished Oxford professor, that the House needed
‘more ordinary blokes.’ ” *
An admirable word. No other expression,
Professor Murdoch has been moved to tell,
In all our spacious language’s possession
Sums up a “man” or “person” half as well.
It’s slang of course, he makes a frank con-
fession,
But still “a splendid monosyllable,”
And one, it seems, that strikes responsive chords
Ev’n in the venerable House of Lords.
They need a few more Toms and Dicks and
Harries
To shield that ancient Chamber from the
storm
That beats upon it, and provide more parries
Against the thrusts which ever grow more
warm
When Socialism’s mounting programme carries
The latest propaganda for reform,
In short, a bunch of ordinary blokes
Among the welter of ennobled folks.
The trouble is, when chaps are given titles
To render them professionally great,
Earldoms and baronies as the requitals
Ostensibly for service to the State,
They’re apt to get a notion in their vitals
• That being acclaimed as men of worth and
weight
Stamps them, by readily accepted strokes,
A cut above mere ordinary Mokes.
Blokes! Aren’t we all? Whoever was the finder
Of this quaint noun Gipsy, it’s been
averred—
Epitomised therein a sort of binder
’Twixt kings and princes and the common
herd,
A wholesome tie, an apposite reminder,
In this incisive and engaging word
That you and I and all of us are kin,
Albeit in little else, in origin.

IMPERIAL CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES OF AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND LIMITED
In the hey-day of cut-purse and assassin, when life
was counted cheap, there was many a sinister
use made of this deadly wheel-lock dagger-
pistol. Ingeniously constructed with a finely
tooled steel blade, and barrel of Damascus
iron, this fine example shows all the
traditional English pride in skilled
craftsmanship.
So today, to the keen sportsman,
the 1.C.1. brand on sporting
ammunition is a hallmark of
consistent high quality and
excellence.
“Waddlin’ Willie”: When waiting for
a plane at the New York airport recently,
Melbourne University’s vice-chancellor
J. D. G. Medley noticed a swarm of
people around an unusual slot-machine.
Closer examination revealed an ingenious
contraption dishing out insurance-policies
as rapidly as coins were slipped into the
slot. The higher the coin the greater
the insurance. When a fellow-traveller
placed 25 cents in the slot entitling him
to a 1000-dollar policy, a loudspeaker
attached to the machinq muttered:
“Don’t you think you should make a
larger contribution? Think of your wife
and kids. After all, you might not re-
turn!”
* * * *
“Bo”: Looking through the wrong end
of telescopes being one of our day’s
popular pastimes, I wasn’t in the least
surprised when, announcing an increase
of 11| p.c. in the price of its commodity,
the g.-m, of a gaslight company added
that “this would work out at a fraction
above a halfpenny a day for the average
domestic consumer.” Now doesn’t that
read much more pleasantly than saying
it’s going to put at least four bob more
on your bill? I find, however, one
glaring inaccuracy in the statement, for
it can be stated with complete confidence
that no such person as an “average
domestic consumer” exists. Years of
questioning friends and acquaintances on
this vital matter have yielded to me
naught but blunt and bitter repudiation
of the suggestion that they could be
classified as “average consumers.” “Why,
my bill’s always above the average—•
well above it!” is their grieved cry.
Now, if everyone’s bill is above the aver-
age, then how in Logic’s name can there
be any who get a bill that is only aver-
age? And that all are above the “average”
is a claim I can readily understand. Only
once during my unchosen career of
keeping gas shareholders and employees
in comfort did I ever get a bill that wasn’t
as large as the one previous. Almost
before I could get it out of the letter-
box a gasman was at the gate putting me
through a catechism as to whether I’d
been on holidays, had we ceased taking
hot baths, etc. Need I add that he
reposes under the concrete floor of my
garage?
* * * *
“Kelms”: Cliches can be infuriating
(B. 21/1/ ’4B). A Perth reporter who
flew over the north of the big State and
discovered a glut of Min. bananas and a
groper in whose gaping mouth a trio of
youths could dance the maypole de-
scribed a station as “sprawling along the
banks of a river.” Now a city may
sprawl, if you like ; it may drape the
ungainly limbs of its hideous carcass over
as many acres as the pallid creatures on
which it thrives may contrive to spoil;
but the great body of Australia, with its
mountain streams, dry watercourses,
wheatlands and sheep pastures, forests
“That tonic you gave him, Doctor, is doing him good.”
and deserts, is alive and pulsating. It is
upstanding, romping, striding or waiting,
but it doesn’t sprawl.
* * * •
“Craiser”: A Melbourne father got an
unexpected angle on Adult Education.
He had been religiously attending the
summer “camp” instituted in the suburbs
by the University and he asked his son,
aged 12, what he would like to be when
he grew up. “I want to be like you,
Dad,” said the young hopeful. “Oh,”
said his parent, immensely flattered. “Hi
what way?” “No good at anything,”
replied the infant.
* ♦ * *
“K.L.W.”: Balts may not be natural
axemen (B. 11/2/’4B), but like all men
who are used to hard work they have
great powers of adaptation. This is evi-
denced by their work around the Shep-
parton district helping to harvest the
fruit-crop. Despite the fact that they
are used to temperatures many degrees
below ours, they toiled with incredible
energy, the Balt gang often putting up a
larger tally than the native-born. The
“acclimatisation course” at Bonegilla has
done very little to give the men a means
of contact with Australians, and in our
camp there was little intercourse between
the two groups. The Balts were only
two months at Bonegilla, and it seems a
pity they didn’t receive a more compre-
hensive instruction in English.
♦ * * *
“X.S.”: New York, noted for fantastic
private social functions, couldn’t equal
this one. Asked by a Beak in Melbourne
to justify the presence of 98 bottles of
beer on his premises, a Richmond marine-
dealer retorted, “I got them to celebrate
my four-year-old daughter’s birthday.”
♦ * * *
“Yipe”: My friend Bert, who keeps
homing pigeons, gives his birds short-flight
training by bringing them into the office
and letting them fly home. Our drab
lunch-hours are enlivened by helping him
shoo his thoroughbreds out the office
window. Lately he has been sending his
wife messages by pigeon-post. He
thought it a great idea—till yesterday.
This morning he complained to me, “Why
don’t the Army train their pigeons pro-
perly? Yesterday afternoon one of their
damned-fool bifds landed in my loft by
mistake. It looked just like my prize
blue-checker, and when the wife collared
it she found a message ‘To Bertie—from
Ollie.’ And d’you think I could con-
vince her that Ollie is the code-name of
some hairbrained, sig. outfit? Never.”
* * * *
“Clooter”: One of my pet aversions is
the journalist who makes loose state-
ments about subjects of which his know-
ledge is limited. Quoting John Buchan
in a political article in Sydney, one of
these gentlemen refers to him as “that
great statesman and author.” To have
called him a great scholar would be
nearer the mark, since his scholastic
career was thick with honors and degrees ;
as an author he was one of the most
prolific of his generation, and he suc-
ceeded in the sense that he was popular,
especially with such fiction as Green-
mantle and The 39 Steps, spy-stories
of the 1914-18 war in which he stooped
unashamedly to the most incredible de-
vices to get his heroes out of trouble.
There was a raft of other and more
serious books, historical, philosophical
and educational, but all his writing lacked
that vital force which makes a book truly
great and assures it life long after the
author’s death. His statesmanship simply
didn’t exist, his public life being confined
to being a minor M.P. and Governor-
General of Canada. A kindly and lov-
able man and an intensely British patriot,
his memory suffers rather than gains from
such overstatements.
* ♦ * *
“Findy”: They were possibly student-
teachers—certainly they were University
students —and as they nibbled their lunch
across the table from me they were dis-
cussing an English exam.-paper. He had
“done two pages” on Lamb and Hazlitt,
she “nearly two.” They talked of the
relative merits of the two essayists. She
ventured the remark that she rather liked
Lamb’s habit of affixing whimsical titles
to his essays, instancing “A Dissertation
on Roast Pig.” He disagreed. In his
opinion Lamb cheapened himself by so
doing; it smacked too much of journal-
ism. The essayists disposed of, they
turned to “The Tempest,” apparently one
of the plays set for study. She seemed
to approve it; he did not. Prospero, for
example, was a preposterous character.
Shakspeare was astray there. “Anyone
with an elementary knowledge of psy-
chology could tell you that.” Listening
involuntarily as I munched my salad, 1
might almost have been convinced that
the young man knew what he was talking
about and was not merely repeating what
someone else had told him, but his final
remark as they left the table settled him.
“The trouble with those sort of
writers...he began.

“Dong”,t Back in' my Third Form days
we had a rage for “fly-jails”—hollowed-
out corks whose tiny windows and doors
were barred with pins. I remember Fatty
Grey, who never skimped things, had a
regular bastille made from a large fish-
ing-cork. When summer passed the days
grew shorter and so did our supply of
prisoners ; and I never saw a fly-jail again
until a few days ago, when my nephew
whisked a victim off my forehead and
deftly locked him up. Then, as the lad
went his way, I learned something of
the benefits of modern education. He
reported his judgment on the latest con-
vict to his younger brother: “I gave this
one six months’ hard without the option
for assaulting Uncle,”
* * * *
“V. Cluse”: A quiet Sunday morning
in our suburb was broken by the yelp-
ing of a dog. When it continued, curious
residents appeared in backyards,- at door-
ways and window/. Then could be heard
the swish, s\vish, swish of a stick or whip,
the dog’s yelps of pain and fear keeping
time with it. The sounds came from be-
hind a high fence. Protesting voices
Were raised as neighbors called to each
other. The swishing and yelping went
on. Then, from further down the street,
came a strident roar; “Hey, who’s that
beltin’ a dawg? Cut it out, or I’ll
come up there -an’ do a bit o’ beltin’
meself!” From behind the high fence
a woman’s voice invited him to mind his
own business. “You cut it out*” he
thundered back. “By cripes, y’ can belt
your old man or your kids, but y’ ain’t
beltin’ no dawgs like that. One more
yelp out o’ that dawg an’ I’m cornin’ at
y’l” The deep and profound silence of
a quiet Sunday moaning was instantly re-
stored.
THE BLACKMARKETEER.
“Appealing through the press for support for the
Fifth Security Loan, the Federal Government urges
the public to ‘put the Blackmarketeer where he
belongs,’ indicating the place with a rough wood-
cut of an occupied pillory.”
When goods of all sorts are in scanty supply
Though plenty of people have money to buy,
It’s easy to see what a field it presents
For the fraudulent schemes of unscrupulous
gents,
What scope for exploiting new rackets it gives
For the class who are sometimes referred to as
“spivs.”
A bird of itl-omen all Governments fear,
A menace and pest is the Blackmarketeer.
Soft-spoken and smooth, with no trace of the
look
Of Sikes or of Crackit, a white-collar crook
Is what you might call him, deceptive and deep;
A wolf —but a wolf in the garb of a sheep!
And, mixing my metaphors more, you may mark
How he works underground like a mole in the
dark.
He’s little to learn about keeping him clear
Of the meshes of Law, has the Blackmarketeer.
He’ll offer you stuff, with a wink of the eye,
For cash unattended with coupons to buy,
And pitch you a story of how it’s been got
Which same you can credit (like Ripley) or not.
And even when slow-going Justice subverts
His games he’s quite likely to dodge his deserts,
Since tolerant Beaks are too seldom severe,
Excepting with fines, on the Blackmarketeer.
The pillory penance, as doubtless you know,
Went right out of fashion some ages ago.
But still one may take it the huskiest thug
Thinks twice before risking a stretch in the jug,
A prospect more drastic than aught that awaits
The thugs whose activities Chifley berates.
Meanwhile, gentle reader, a word in your ear,
Though it’s petrol you chance to be out of,
or beer,
Beware, Q beware, of the Blackmarketeer I

something called a “drill-hall”
which looks like a more than
usually dismal Chinese vegetable-
store. Galvanised-iron without
end has often been used in the
construction of these edifices,
and long years between paintings
have lent a venerable air of
dilapidation to them even when
they have been refurbished. The
air about them is one of depres-
sion, and to raise any enthusiasm
in some would be a test of
optimism beyond the powers of
the bravest leaders.
There are usually no facili-
ties for outdoor drill or sport
on a sufficient scale and no
proper accommodation for the
vehicles which now form an
integral part of every unit or-
ganisation.
There are no workshops, no
amenities worth the name, often
no efficient bathing facilities,
nothing to fill the recruit with
pride of possession. The senior
officers who are undertaking the
work of organising the new com-
mands, very much at their own
expense, must have the hearts of
lions.
The problem is not an easy
one to solve.
The Ideal
The ideal Citizen Force H.Q.
is an area of up to 10 acres,
with parade-ground, football-
ground and tennis- or squash-
courts, a bandstand and a
bright, clean hall fitted with
microphone and lantern equip-
“It’s four bells. Skipper, an things ain’t too Well!”
ment and with a floor suitable
for social activities. It should
have efficient stabling for
vehicles and a fitted workshop.
Its exterior * utilities should be
surrounded by parkland, which
should occupy some of its acre-
age, It should, in fact, be a
community-centre which could
be used for other purposes and
in which its locality should take
a pride.
With these facilities the unit
would be able to work in com-
fort, to give recruits manual
training, organise them for
sport, breed a competitive spirit
between units and localities and
enable military training to be
linked with civil life.
Under proper planning these
training centres should attract
the attention of the local school-
boy and schoolgirl, and it should
be possible to link cadet and
rifle and other weapon training
with them and assure both a
regular inflow of youthful
volunteers and supplementary
exercise in weapons for those
who have gone through their
courses.
Municipalities are naturally
loath to see areas of several
acres given up to public pur-
poses, since it means a loss of
rates. But in many centres
around Sydney this should be
possible to arrange, and in the
smaller capitals and growing in-
dustrial towns the present is the
time to provide for permanent
training bases.
Linkage with Civil Defence
One of the great needs for
the future will be training H.Q.
for civil-defence units and effi-
cient deep shelters to be used
in the event of war to house
very large numbers of people.
The provision of these might be
made under training areas, thus
providing an insurance.
They would, of course, be
costly. But regarded in the light
of an insurance rate the charge
would be light. Sydney Harbor
Bridge cost £10,000,000-odd and
would cost twice that amount
today. As an insurance
premium £10,000,000 spent on
military training-grounds and
shelters of this type would be
a small item in Sydney.
To those who say that the
risk of war is remote it may
be remarked that there have
been more wars affecting the
whole population of Australia
than, there have been fires affect-
ing large parts of it. Yet
there is scarcely any house-
holder who does not willingly
pay his fire premium regularly
year after year.
The New Neros.
“Ek Dum”: Lord Tedder,
Chief of the Air Staff, remarked
in London that “if the British
lion appeared to be weakening
the jackals would soon be yap-
ping at his flanks.”
Britain (he added) could be
the strongest force in the world
for peace, but peace without
power was merely a dream.
On the same day, fanned by
the feeble attitude of the Gov-
ernment in the dispute with two
cheeky totalitarian countries,
there were bursts of indignation
from leading newspapers in
Britain at the dreadful emascu-
lation of defence and whiftling-
away of protection at a time
when war clouds are dark over
Europe.
Under the 1948-49 plans of
the Government, defence costs
will fall to a lower level than for
years despite increased costs
and more intensive armaments
demanded by current conditions.
The total provided for the
coming year is only £692,000,000,
against seven times that amount
budgeted for by Russia, and the
total strength of all the services
is to fall from 940,000 to 716,000,
which means fewer than 200,000
for the front line in all branches.
The intake for compulsory train-
ing will be only 150,000 a year
in the next three years, and the
age of the call-up has been
raised.
The service reductions will be
generally on the lines of the fol-
lowing figures:
1947-48. 1948-49.
Army .. .. 534,000 345,000
Navy .. .. 145,000 145,000
R.A.F 261,000 226,000
Upon the Army will be spent
£305,000,000, of which
£75,000,000 will be disbursed
overseas.
In place of effective defences
the country has been given
plenty of words, which, as this
country knows, are the favorite
weapons of Labor politicians.

TO ARCHITECTS, CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERS
AND BUILDING OWNERS ,
In Sydney, as in all the principal cities of Australia, Waygood-
Otis Lift installations predominate in department stores, hotels,
offices, hospitals, warehouses and flats.
Architects, construction engineers and building owners*
confronted with the problem of lifts to suit their particular
traffic abd budget requirements, often draw upon our
specialised design experience of lift control systems. Such
constructive technical assistance is available to you—without
obligation.
WAYGOO.D-

d
years and since before the re-
publics which claim them existed,
declares that the Government
“intends to maintain the forces
needed to support its interna-
tional policy, ensure the defence
of Britain, maintain its interests
throughout the world and enable
it to play a part in the preserva-
tion of world peace.”
“To Him that Asks”
It will be easy to fulfil the
first part of the programme,
since the international policy of
the Government is based on the
words “to him that asks shall be
given,” unless public indigna-
tion forces a change. It has
handed over India to the Indians,
Burma to a Burmese Communis-
tic minority. Its prestige and
rights in China have been aban-
doned to a Chinese Govern-
ment incapable of protecting
either itself or its nationals.
Egypt has gone, and with it the
Palestine mandate, the one base
from which pipeline oil supplies
from the Persian fields to the
Mediterranean can be properly
protected. The Royal Navy has
been reduced —temporarily at
least—to a basis under which the
Home Fleet has been whittled
down to a cruiser and four de-
stroyers.
Outside home waters there are
two carriers, 10 cruisers and 32
destroyers.
It is true that battleships are
in reserve, and it may be that
they are being reconditioned to
meet modern requirements of de-
fence. But it would certainly
take a long time to get them to
sea again, and, if attack comes,
a long time will not be available.
Meanwhile evidence accumu-
lates on every hand that Russia
contemplates war against Britain
in particular.
On to World Revolution
M, Dmitrov—former Bul-
garian Peasant-party leader, not
to be confused with Dmitrov
the Communist—declares that
the Soviet Union’s idea is to
overpower Europe and the
Middle East and organise them
as an iron wall against Anglo-
American democratic front,
while “preparing for its future
conflict for the subjugation of
the Americas and the comple-
tion of the world revolution.”
The British Government is
perfectly aware of this plan, as
is shown by Mr, Attlee’s state-
ment only last week that the
“fight between democracy and
totalitarianism is on and
Communism has turned its back
on civilisation... .reverted to
Czarism.”
Yet the very next week he an-
nounces a startling reduction in
the defence forces!
However, Australians cannot
complain. Their own Govern-
ment are pacifists beside the
British Government.
Canberra’s proceedings must
cause a great deal of what the
late Herr Ribbentrop used to
call “Tartar laughter” in Mos-
cow. Messrs. Chifley and
Attlee have a fair chance of
replacing Nero in the hall of
fame among future generations.
Death in the Air.
All Australia will sympathise
with the relatives of the 16
members of the R.A.A.F. who
were killed in a bomber crash
at Amberley, Brisbane, on Feb.
19. The aircraft was a Lincoln
which recently had been used
over the Tasman Sea in the
search for the missing yacht
Rangi. Many of them were
officers with fine war records;
some were just beginning their
careers: —

From the official report it
appears that, in coming in to
land at sundown, the pilot over-
shot and found himself too far
up the strip. His wheels had
touched the runway, but he de-
cided to take the bomber aloft
again.
In doing so he seems to have
lost control. At 800 ft. the Lin-
coln’s nose pointed upwards and
its port wing swung down and
eventually the machine nose-
dived, crashed on its wing and
exploded on hitting the ground.
The captain was a thoroughly
experienced officer and had won
a D.F.C. during the war. He
was not a man to take undue
risks, but risks there always are
with a heavy bomber near the
ground, and these even the
boldest and readiest pilot cannot
always conquer.
Bloodshed in the East.
“Ek Dum”: Matters are in a
pretty pickle in the Near and
Middle East.
In Turkey feeling runs high
against the Bulgarians for shoot-
ing down Turkish aircraft which,
seemingly accidentally, flew over
Bulgarian territory.
A shocking explosion in the
very heart of Jerusalem, which
killed 43 and wounded 96,
destroyed three hotels and a
multitude of shops, cafes,
cinemas, etc., and damaged 1000
houses, was apparently carried
out by men in British uniforms,
which raised the Jewish ex-
tremists, and especially the
Eastern European quota, to
Ravage hatred of the only nation
which has so far shown an active
disposition to protect them.
The official Arab headquarters
flatly denied association with
the horrible atrocity, which was
more in keeping with the tech-
nique of the Irgun Zeumi than
of the Arabs, who, in any case,
have learned from the Jews how
to use bombs ; the Jews’ instruc-
tors in turn were Balkan Com-
munist terrorists An “un-
official” Arab source in Jeru-
salem says that a special
commando of Arabs, trained
abroad, did the wrecking;
but the evidence needs to
be closely examined, and it is
not without significance that
Communist radio stations appear
to view what took place with
relish and to represent it as the
product of British terrorism.
On the day of the explosion
the Arab League of
spokesman announced that no
more oil-boring or pipeline con-
cessions would be granted to
nationals of countries which
forced the partition of Palestine.
This, of course, includes Aus-
tralians, Dr. Evatt having been
a moving spirit in promoting
the present sorry mess, which
will almost inevitably lead to a
bloody local, and perhaps a
European, war before it is all
over.
Apart from Palestine, the in-
stability of the Eastern Europe
area was further marked this
week by the vigorous attempt of
the agents of U.S.S.R. to take
over Czechoslovakia—for whose
independence the British were
furiously urged to fight in 1938,
and called “appeasers” when
they didn’t—by treacherous Rus-
sian agents who themselves were
at the time deep in intrigue
with Hitler and Von Ribbentrop.
President Benes will have
good cause to regret the moment
that he turned his back on the
West.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Australia’s staunch friend Dr. Thomas
Wood ( Cobbers ) has settled down after
his wideflung war-time wanderings (per
favor the Lords of the Admiralty) in
his home village of Bures, Suffolk,
five miles by monkish tunnel from Eng-
land’s most haunted rectory at Borley,
which isn’t haunted any more because it
has been burned down. He has become
chairman of the Royal Philharmonic
Society, and he and his wife celebrated by
handing over £12,000 to found six
scholarships in its name for composition.
The first awards will be made in March.
Recently Wood published the first music
he has written since Munich —a setting of
“The Nonne Preestes Tale” of Chaucer in
the Nevill Coghill version ; reported to
be a cheerful piece, unorthodox in that
the last three-quarters of an hour is en-
tirely for The first performance
will be on April 7. The doctor has, alas,
almost abandoned writing, but he wrote
a preface to a new edition of
Robbery Under Arms, which the Oxford
University Press has in hand.
In the negotiations for the British-
Argentinian Trade Agreement two Aus-
tralians have been well in the centre of
the stage, Clive Baillieu as head of the
British trade mission and Reginald
Leeper as British Ambassador. It can
scarcely have been the first time the two
had met. With only a year separating
their ages, both were educated at Mel-
bourne Grammar and Trinity College,
Melbourne Uni., and both went on to
Oxford —Leeper to New College, Baillieu
to Magdalen. From Oxford Leeper
joined the Foreign Office, served in the
Legations in Warsaw, Riga and Constan-
tinople, became Minister to Rumania,
and before his appointment to Buenos
Aires was for three years Ambassador to
the Greek Government-in-Exile. Baillieu
rowed for Oxford in 1913, was admitted
to the Inner Temple, put in three years
of World War I with the A.I.F, and
R.A.F., then embarked on a career which
has brought him a hatful of directorships
and appointments on many Government
commissions. He was Director-General
of the British Purchasing Commission in
1941, then head of the Raw Materials
Mission and British representative on the
Combined Raw Materials Board. When
after nine weeks of negotiations finality
in the Argentine talks seemed as far off
as ever Baillieu announced that come
what might he was sailing for England
in the liner Andes, then in port. Next
day a trade-agreement was signed on
board the vessel. At the suggestion of
Leeper it was called the “Andes Agree-
ment” in honor of the Argentine moun-
tains and British shipbuilding.
Sydney R.A.S. is importing Walter
Biggar from Castle-Douglas (Scot.) to
judge fat cattle and polled and horned
Shorthorns at Sydney Show next month.
A lifelong breeder of Galloway cattle
and of fat lambs, he’s been collecting
prizes at Edinburgh and Smithfield for
years with stock reared on his Grange
Farm, bulls from which have made up
to £1316 a head and averaged £6BO at
Perth (Scot.) sales—prices to make local
cattlemen water at the mouth. Biggar
judged steers at Chicago (U.S.A.) in
1930, and pleased everybody so much
that he was invited to judge for the
next 10 years.
Making a rush lecturing visit to Aus-
tralia under the auspices of the British
Council are Basil Henriques and his wife,
accepted authorities on juvenile delin-
quency and similar matters. Educated
at Harrow, Henriques belongs to a
noted Anglo-Jewish family, and has for
many years devoted himself to Boys’
Club work in London’s East End. Like
Rabbi Jacob Danglow, Archie Michaelis
and many other co-religionists in Aus-
tralian public life, Henriques holds the
view which Isaac Isaacs steadfastly up-
held —that he is a Jew by religion only,
and believes that apart from his faith his
only loyalty is to the British Crown.
Henriques founded the Jewish Fellowship
to set forth these views, which, although
not acceptable to political Zionists, are
held by the majority of British and Aus-
tralian Jewry.
Over a quarter of a century ago Arthur
Gask, an Adelaide dentist, as a relief
from yanking out molars and filling bi-
cuspids, nutted out the plot of a thriller.
In between appointments he committed it
to paper, then posted it off to a London
publisher and awaited results. The pub-
lisher snapped up The Secret of the
CRIME STORIES.
Sandhills, based on an incident which
happened on the dunes near an Adelaide
beach, and asked for more. Gask kept
on pulling teeth and kept on writing
thrillers. Fifteen years ago he retired
from practice, and what had started as a
hobby became his profession. He has
turned out 29 whodunits, and royalties
from each of the last three exceeded
£lOOO. At 79 he is still at it and has three
books at present on the stocks. His son
Cecil was war correspondent for an
American paper and is now on the staff
of “Time.” Coventry protests that if the
figure here diagrammed looks more like
a professor than a thrill merchant the
fault is the subject’s, not his.
Laurence John Hartnett, C.8.E.,
appointed to the Victorian Housing Com-
mission, has had a long experience of
mass-production, and it is large masses of
construction the State needs. Born
at Woking (Eng.), he served apprentice-
ship to engineering at Vickers’ vast works.
Followed three years’ service as a lieuten-
ant with the R.A.F. in World War I;
then he cropped up in Singapore as motor-
division g.m. with the old and big firm of
Guthrie’s. Later he handled India for
General Motors, was at the headquarters
of the co. in New York and then manag-
ing their affairs in Sweden. The Soviet
invited him to Russia to report on the
potentialities of the new republic. Coming
to Australia as managing director of
General Motors-Holden’s in 1934, he
directed the Commonwealth Aircraft
Corporation and ordnance production
during the war. A big man physically and
industrially, he’s 50.
The average professorial utterance
wouldn’t make a stir in an ornamental
fishpond, but Gordon Leslie Wood, M.A.,
D. Litt., Professor of Commerce at the
University of Melbourne, set a storm
raging from Portland to Mallacoota
when he said that Victorian fishermen
were of a very sissy pattern. He was
promptly challenged to come out and try
the evidence of his senses by dozens of
husky deep-sea skippers, from Ron
Shafter, ex-footballer and soldier, to Stan
Mannix, a 17-stoner, who search 'for
sharks in one of the world’s stormiest
stretches of water. Professor Wood was
born at Launceston in 1890, entered the
Tas. Education Department, and gradu-
ated from the University to a master-
ship at St. Peter’s College, Adelaide. He
is a Fellow of the Rockefeller Founda-
tion and a member of the Commonwealth
Grants Commission. If he hasn’t had
much direct acquaintance with the ocean
he has at least written a book about it—
The Pacific Basin.
Viscount Sankey, dead in London at 81,
was Lord Chancellor in the MacDonald Gov-
ernment of 1929 and in the first National Gov-
ernment, but that was merely the culmina-
tion of an already distinguished career as ad-
vocate and Judge. Called to the Bar by the
Middle Temple in 1892, he early decided to
concentrate on workmen’s-compensation cases,
and a long string of successful pleas before the
Court of Appeal earned him a big reputation
and an income to match. Just before the first
war Lord Haldane raised him to the Supreme
Court Bench, and in 1915 he was appointed to
the Aliens Advisory Committee; a year later
he shared the responsibility of considering the
cases of the Sinn Feiners arrested after the
Easter Rebellion. When the war was over
Sankey became chairman of a board of Com-
missioners appointed to inquire into the coal
industry. Long investigations produced four
reports. In the last of them —which was not
unanimous—Sankey advocated nationalisation.
It was probably memory of this that
prompted Ramsay MacDonald to offer him the
Lord Chancellorship many years later. While
a Judge of King’s Bench Division and later in
the Court of Appeal he was often called upon
for extra-judicial work chairmanship of the
Inter-Imperial Relationship Committee of the
Imperial Conference and of the Federal Struc-
ture Committee of the Round Table Conference
on India are two notable examples. Honorary
degrees were conferred on him by the univer-
sities of Oxford, Cambridge, Wales and Bristol.
“H.W.M.”; Isaac Isaacs was devoted
to his parents. I was his office-boy years
ago, and every Saturday morning he
would say “Come on, Harry, we’ll go and
get the dinner for Mum and Dad.” He
would come along with me to a cafe in
Swanston-street, where I would pick up
a hot dinner in a tin and out we’d
go to Auburn, where the parents lived.
He generally read' on the way out in the
train and on one occasion said to me
“Haven’t you anything to read?” When
I said “No,” he handed me a loose sheet
of the newspaper he was reading and said,
“Here, then, read this,” It was a loose
sheet devoted exclusively to mining, in
which I hadn’t the slightest interest. It
might have been better for me if I had
remained that way.
About 10 years ago Mel Nichols com-
pleted a nature film called “Song of the
Bush,” which he sold to the Australian
National Travel Association. Later the
Government took over the film and sold
it to the film people Bell and Howell.
A few weeks pgo Nichols heard that
several thousand copies of it are still going
the rounds in America. Nichols’s latest
film, “Time Off,” now on the Australian
circuit, seems likely to go the same way—
it is a fascinating study of such things as
a lyrebird, platypus, bower-birds, wag-
tails, a diamond dyke and many other shy
creatures of the Australian bush. Since
the cast had no respect for photographer,
director or script, it required unlimited
patience and perseverance to shoot—
often at a range of only 2ft. or 3ft.—and
the film took nearly five years to com-
plete. Nichols and his stepdaughter,
whom he classes as the best technician
NATURE FILMS.
in Australia, worked together as a com-
plete film unit. They built their own
cutting-room,* soundproofed it, and did
their own editing, and recording. A Tas-
manian, Nichols drifted into the movie
game from a photographic business in the
Speck. He was with Cinesound for a
while ; and later went as official photo-
grapher to the Silver Jubilee in 1935,
filming the celebrations in color for British
Movietone News. Later he made a trade
film in color of Ceylon, and followed
that with aerial travel-pictures of many
parts of the globe. He was D. of I.
photographer with the A.I.F. in Malaya,
after which he joined the R.A.A.F. and,
as officer-in-charge of the cine unit m
the S.W.P.A., saw and recorded most ot
what went on in the islands.
Dora Ohlfsen, the Australian sculptress
who met an accidental death in Rome,
was Dora Ohlfsen Bagge when she was a
Gallery student in Melbourne. Born at
Ballarat, she spent most of her long hie
in Europe, where she gained a reputation
as a medallion portraitist, though she had
many other commissions, one of which
gave her a unique distinction. Mussolini
commissioned her to sculpt the First
World War Memorial at Formia Naval
Base —said to be the first public work in
Europe carried out by a woman and the
only Italian war memorial done by a
non-Italian. A life-size portrait of the
Duke of Aosta and a medallion of Mus-
solini were also her work. She was a
Red Cross nurse in the Italian Army m
World War One.
Appointed senior lecturer in veterinary
pathology and bacteriology at Sydney
Uni. School of Veterinary Science, under
Professor R. S. Came, R. V, S, Bam
moves over from the Adelaide Institute
of Medical and Veterinary Science, where
he has been acting-deputy-director and
veterinary pathologist. He collected his
vet. degree in Sydney in 1937, and served
with an Army veterinary survey unit in
Northern Territory and New Gumea
during the war. He’s 31.
Jock Bardon of Lammermoor, near
Cloncurry (Q.), who spends his spare-
time flying a Gipsy Moth around
Northern Queensland, will go aloft with
a sense of pride shortly. His plane wul
be powered by the engine salvaged more
than 15 years ago from the Puss Moth
flown by Bert (Hustling) Hinkler when
he crashed in the Italian Alps. Soon
after the salvage, the engine was brought
to Australia and installed in a Genairco
aircraft. Jock, with a traditional keen
sense of value, bought it for £25.
Sir Henry Turner, Director of Meat
and Livestock to the Ministry of Food,
London, on a , flying visit to Australia
seeking more meat for hungry Britain,
spent 20 years in New Zealand as man-
ager of the N.Z, Refrigerating Co. He is
a past-president of the Canterbury (MX.)
Chamber of Commerce and a past-vice-
president of the Associated Chambers ot
Commerce in the Dominion. An
economic adviser to the 1919 Paris peace
conference, he was educated at the Lower
School of John Lyon, Harrow. He will
visit Darwin and Wyndham to investigate
the export of meat from those ports.
Into the Silence;
In Sydney (Yaralla military hospital), at 57,
John Patrick Ferguson, serviceman (W. 0., nrst-
class), and father of three others. Many Ola
Diggers and Tommies remember Ferguson tor
his work in Egypt, Gallipoli, France and
Britain, particularly during the Peninsula ana
Somme campaigns and after the Chemm-des-
Dames affair, as assistant to Dr. Fiaschi, tor
whose father, the General, he had worked as
a lad. Though three bouts of rheumatic-fever
permanently impaired his heart, Ferguson
waived his claim to a pension, and for 2A
years was a loyal and devoted health ana
building inspector at Burwood. In peace ana
in war he worked till he dropped, being that
sort of man.
In Sydney, at 72, Ernest Frederick Hunter
Harpur, veteran Australian journalist who, as
State roundsman for the “S. M. Herald early
in the century, suggested the establishment or
Government baby clinics to the then Minister
of Health.
In Sydney, at 60, Dr. Sydney Evan Jones,
medical superintendent of Broughton Hah
since 1925. Adelaide-born, he gained his early
education in that city and at Ipswich Grammar,
won an exhibition to Sydney University ana
graduated M.B. in 1910. He went to the
Antarctic as surgeon on Mawson’s first ex-
pedition, and led a party on a 200-mile trek
to Haswell Island, where he discovered one ot
the two known rookeries of emperor penguins.
He lectured at Sydney University on psychiatry
and physiotherapy, was a keen student ot
languages and had a much more than amateur
knowledge of mechanical engineering.
At Bendigo (Vic.), at 81, James Sutherland
Sharland, one of Victoria’s best-known civil
and hydraulic engineers. With Monash he
was associated in the Monar Bridge Construc-
tion company, and he was one of the early
members of designing and constructional stall
of the Victorian Railways. At various times
he was a shire engineer, town surveyor of Gee-
long, chief engineer Geelong Water and Sewer-
age ’Trust, and consulting engineer for many
sewerage authorities. In his day Sharland was
a noted gun-shot, angler and amateur billiard-
player.


Women's Letters
From Sydney
Party of the week was that given by
Lieut.-General Berryman and Mrs. Berry-
man in the G.O.C.’s house at Victoria
Barracks last Friday. The guests-of-
honor were General Sir Oliver Leese and
Lady Leese. To renew desert comrade-
ship with the General, who is linked in
Australian minds with the Middle East,
was a group of ex-Ninth Australian
Division men and their wives. This was
a real soldier party, though all the lads
weren’t in uniform. Sir Oliver himself
was in tweeds, and knight Leslie Mors-
head was there disguised as a business-
man in a snappy line of civvies.
General Berryman was a proud host,
Mrs. Berryman a graceful hostess,
and daughter Anne in a brightly-pat-
terned silk frock and with a red rose in
her hair was an alert aide. Lady Leese
was slimness ( in printed silks and a
straight-brimmed black hat, its rather
high crown banded in black velvet. Jade-
green and black were allied in Mrs.
Berryman’s ground-length frock. As the
guests arrived and were greeted they
drifted out to the narrow verandah. Here
Sir Oliver himself, very tall, stood and
talked to you about everything, and par-
ticularly about Monty.
And as he spoke, Monty, that Joshua
in a beret, became very vivid and in-
domitable. “I know I have the British
public with me, and I will do it this way
and this way,” he had said in the very
beginning of the campaign. And so that
continuous mechanised sweep across the
desert began, with battles sometimes 500
miles apart. But always, as Sir Oliver
put it, “they were travelling in the right
direction.” And as he talked the sun
and glare of those desert days became
more real than the flowers in the garden
beyond the verandah railing, growing
pallid in the withdrawing day.
Among the company were knight Leslie
Morshead’s lady and Orient Company’s
Mrs. Anderson. Brigadier and Mrs. Pul-
ver were in a group with Brigadier and
Mrs. Windeyer, and Colonel and Mrs.
Mann (her turquoise frock in nice con-
trast to her brown hair) found much to
say to Brigadier Simpson. There was
quite a Consular note —U.S.A. Consul-
General Orsen Nielsen and Mrs. Nielsen
were noted. The Qantas Hudson Fyshes
and the banker McKerihan couple,
Brigadier Rogers, Admiral and Mrs,
Moore were importants, and among
things admired was Mrs. Best’s frock of
French grey.
The Australian Book Society has a
very sturdy, growing family. Members
packed out the Feminist Club last Wed-
nesday (one of Sydney’s hottest and
dampest) to greet publisher William Col-
lins. He is tall, lean and dark, and wears
his reputed millions with the same ease
with which most writers wear their re-
soled shoes. He sat at a long top table
completely surrounded by local girls who
have made good—Dame Mary Gilmore
and Ethel Turner Curlewis leading easily
—big business, such as Charles Lloyd
Jones, and representatives of publishing
houses. There was also a pretty youne
daughter of the guest-of-honor—Deborah
Collins, as fragrant as the posy she held
in her hand.
From what Mr. Collins said it seems
that booksellers in America are no longer
on the up and up. In some obscure way
difficult for a mere’writer to follow, the
Book of the Month clubs and literary
guilds have something to do with this.
But the poet who is always poor can’t
be expected to weep over the U.S. book-
seller who is now not so rich. Where
Mr. Collins covered himself with glory
was in telling all about the publishing
trade, and he should know a bit about
that. His family has been at the job since
1819.
Novelist Miles Franklin was a listener,
as were writers of children’s stories Mrs.
Lister and Mrs. H. Buck, and Chief
Justice Jordan’s wife and her sister Mrs.
Roche, the Henry Braddon lady, R.A.S.
president Erik Langker, Francis Jackson,
Stuart Gurr, Brian Hawkins and his
mother from Brisbane. Honorable men-
tion to secretary Mrs. Handford for
smoothness of the arrangements, and to
president G. Godfrey for clearness of
diction.
There were V.As. from Gunnedah and
Narromine and Maoriland, so that the
girl from Queanbeyan, after a while,
knew she needn’t feel a stranger at all,
and stepped firmly into the long, narrow
lounge of the new V.A. Club, where
opening benediction was being given
by Sydney’s Mayoress, Mrs. R. J.
Bartley. There was a terrific crush.
State Commandant Persia Porter and her
handmaidens were in their light-blue uni-
forms, and the Enzed lady, who wore
grey tabs on her shoulders, was in dark-
navy. There were V.As. in mufti —smart
cocktail frocks and hats —and the most
exquisite white-embroidery collar and
cuffs were worn by Matron Pigeon on
her trig black crepe frock.
It being the end of a turgid day, the
atmosphere was Turkish-bathish —some-
one (it couldn’t have been one of the
military) suggested the place might be
called “salon for slenderising V.As.”
However, the rooms won’t always be so
crowded as at last Thursday’s gala open-
ing. Victoria Barracks came to the affair
—General Berryman’s signature was the
first in the distinguished-visitors’ book.
Probably Matron Looker of Prince
Alfred’s also inscribed a page. She is
very important in the nursing world of
Sydney. Ruby Storey was there, and
Hugh Cable, who does so much for Red
Cross, and vice-chairman J. D. L. Gaden.
Major Joyce Snelling was a well-known,
and Colonel Nelson an important.
The club is in the basement of Red
Cross House in Jamieson-street. It com-
prises a lounge, a rest-room and a can-
teen. The lounge is furnished and deco-
rated in tones of green, cream and bur-
gundy. Window curtains are green and
silver. There were masses of glorious
dahlias arranged in bowls in the lounge
itself and at the entrance. Mixed with
the dahlias were the graceful hanging
pink flowers called Chinese lanterns. The
whole color scheme and arrangement are
due to Hugh Cable’s decorative sense.
The club will be open from eleven in the
morning till a quarter to eight from Mon-
day to Thursday. On Friday it will re-
main open till ten in the evening.
Noel Coward’s “Blithe Spirit” wafted
about the stage of the Royal last Satur-
day having great fun. Bettina Welch (in
the picture) again plays the part of
Elvira, the novelist’s first wife who, get-
ting a chance to come back to earth, re-
fuses to again retire beyond the tomb.
“Blithe Spirit” replaces, temporarily,
“Under the Counter” because poor Cicely
Courtneidge developed severe tonsillitis,
and “Under the Counter” without Cicely
would be like lamb without mint-sauce.
When french dress-designer Pierre
Balmain was in Australia he was invited
to the Balmain Police Citizens’ Boys’
Club. The boys wove him a scarf in
honor of the occasion. One. youngster
during the evening said to him: “What
do you do?” Pierre answered: “I draw
pictures of dresses, then I make them.”
And he thereupon took pencil and paper
and drew the design of a dress for the
small boy. Now back in Paris Pierre has
made his design into a very smart affair
indeed. It has a pleated skirt of Buchanan
tartan, and a jacket of sage-green and a
jaunty tarn of the sage-green as accom-
paniment. He sent the whole out last
week, to raise money for the club’s funds.
New Chief Commissioner of Police J. F.
Scott was presented with the suit at a
cocktail party in David Jones’s restaurant
annexe last Friday. It was the new Com-
missioner’s first public function since tak-
ing office. Mrs. Scott accompanied him.
Newly - engaged Marie Fagan, of
Sunnyridge, Mandurama, to Surgeon
John MacMahon. Marie is just back
from six months’ holiday in U.S.
Those Girl Guides and Boy Scouts
know what they’re doing. For their fare-
well to World Chief Guide Lady Baden-
Powell they took her on a Harbor cruise.
No better choice could have been made,
since Thursday was about the hottest
night of the summer. They had a real
campfire rally without the fire. There
was singing and there were games, and
Lady Baden-Powell gave them one of
her heartening talks. On Friday this
magnetic lady sailed in the Wahine for
Maoriland, her visit to that land having
been delayed by the unfortunate outbreak
of infantile paralysis there. While on
her voyage across the Tasman Lady
8.-P. broadcast over Radio Australia
to all Guiding countries.
The stationery of the Aberdeen-Angus
Society of Australia is headed by a most
impressive picture of one of the lords of
the pasture. It is on this notepaper that
the Council of the Society is giving en-
thusiasts preliminary tidings of the annual
dinner. March 22 is the date, the Carlton
Hotel the place set for the party. The
Aberdeen-Anguses will be there in the
flesh, but not in the spirit. They, poor
things, will provide the steaks.
From Melbourne
The consular residence in South Yarra
was gay with gladioli, delphiniums and
autumn foliage when the Consul for
U.S.A., Ralph Hunt, and Mrs. Hunt gave
a late-afternoon party in honor of the
new Consul-General of the U.S.A.,
Samuel J. Fletcher, and Mrs. Fletcher.
Mrs. Hunt received the guests in
a black crepe frock the last yoke of which
was tied with narrow black ribbon. Mrs.
Fletcher was also in black crepe, the
sleeves short and the skirt of the new
length. Among the guests were the Chief
Justice of the High Court of Australia,
Sir John Latham, and the Chief Justice
of Victoria, Sir Edmund Herring, and
Lady Herring. With Premier Hollway
was his wife, wearing an ensemble of
aqua-blue crepe and small dusty-pink
flower-trimmed hat. Mrs. Sidney Myer
wore a white jacket suit with a large black
silk straw hat. The wife of Vice-Consul
H. B. Leggett wore a stunning American
jacket suit of nigger-brown taffeta, the
skirt heavily corded at the hem to make
it bell-shape.
With Colonel Ralph Michaelis, U.S.
Air Attache, was his wife, whose Gibson
Girl outfit comprised a new-length black
taffeta skirt and white broderie Anglaise
blouse. Mrs. Alan Newton set off her
black-satin frock and blue-fox cape with
a large silk crinoline straw hat. Mrs.
J. W. Brophy’s dove-grey wool romaine
suit was highlighted with grey Persian-
lamb pockets. A small beige hat went
with the beige ensemble worn by Mrs.
L. J. McConnan. Among other guests
were Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Allen, Sir
Charles and Lady Lowe, Mr. and Mrs.
Russell Grimwade, Canadian Trade Com-
missioner F. W. Fraser and Mrs. Fraser,
the U.S. Assistant Military Attache
Colonel S. Sauer and Mrs. Sauer, General
Hugh Hester and Mrs. Hester and Vice-
Consul Martin Blackmun and Mrs.
Blackmun.
Feature of the ex-servicemen’s Cabaret
Ball at St. Kilda Town Hall was the
parade of the 15 nurses who are entrants
in the Queen competition which has been
organised to aid the War Nurses
Memorial Centre appeal. Each girl was
presented by Colonel A. E. Coates with
a sash bearing the name of the hospital
she represented. Major and Mrs. Roy
Upson with Mrs. Gladys Hain received
the guests. . Mrs. Upson’s draped black-
crepe romaine frock had two diamond
clips set in the deep neckline of her
frock. Mrs. Hain chose a coffee-toned
lace frock, and over it wore a three-
quarter-length midnight-blue taffeta coat.
In the official party were Colonel and
Mrs. W, Kent Hughes, Lieut.-General
Clowes, Air-Commodore and Mrs. Knox
Knight and Sister V. Bullwinkel, who
wore a graceful ice-blue gown, the skirt
featuring a large bustle bow.
Dressing for the opening of the
National Theatre Movement’s production
of “Aida” at the Princess revived
memories of past gala first-nights of
opera, with accent on diamond tiaras,
glorious dresses and luxurious furs. Lady
Dugan, who sat with the of the
National Theatre, knight Robert" Knox,
and his wife, looked very regal in an
aquamarine crepe gown and diamond
clips. Her Excellency was accompanied
by Mrs. George Maxwell, gowned in
white; and Penelope Nettlefold, who wore
a short white fur cape with her blue
gown. Also in the official party were the
Lady Mayoress, Mrs. Bernard Heinze, in
flame-colored velvet evening gown, and
Professor Heinze; the Chief Justice, Sir
John Latham, and his wife and daughter
Freda and Major Robert Lindsay and
Mrs. Lindsay.
Mrs. H. F. Creswick wore a striking
petunia chiffon cape with her beige-lace
frock; Mrs. P. L. Coleman’s soft-pink
lace gown had the pattern outlined in
crystal beads ; over it she wore a white
Arctic-fox cape. Gladys Moncrieff wore
a black gown with heavy gold em-
broideries on the short sleeves. She sat
in a box with Gertrude Johnson, Director
of the National Theatre, and Madame
Florence Austral. Former grand-opera
star Madame Angelau, who had sung
Amneris at La Scala and the Metro-
politan, not only made-up young Justine
Rettick, who took the role, but lent her
some of the splendid jewellery she herself
had worn while dressed as Amneris.
Well-known pianist Viva Holgate-Clarke
wore a floral satin gown and full-length
fur coat. Pastel-blue lace with a very full
skirt was chosen by Mrs. Norman Lynch.
Engagement is announced of Margaret,
youngest daughter of Mrs. Beatrice
Campbell, of East St. Kilda, and the late
Cr, Edward Campbell, a former Lord
Mayor of Melbourne, to Frank Bolitho,
only son of Mr. and Mrs. L. Bolitho, of
Dandenong. Margaret is publicity officer
for the Southern auxiliary of the Tweddle
Hospital, and is also a member of'‘the
new junior Meadowcroft auxiliary of the
Eye and Ear Hospital.
The draped, the slimly-cut and the
pleated skirt enjoyed about equal favorit-
ism at the Caulfield meeting. Mrs.
Norman Robinson, wife of the V.A.T.C.
chairman, favored a dove-grey jacket-
suit, with which she wore a white cloche
hat trimmed with green-and-white niched
ribbon. One of her guests at luncheon,
Mrs. Norman Martin, wife of Victoria’s
Agent-General, also wore a grey en-
semble ; her small grey hat carried a
shoulder-length ostrich-feather. Mrs,
James Robertson’s black flat crepe frock
had black-satin bows edged in gold
appliqued all over the skirt and bodice ;
a large net bow was set under the crown
of her large black-straw hat. A black
skirt, powder-blue bodice, short black
bolero and large black-straw hat were
the choice of Mrs. A. L. Walters. A
canary-yellow tailored suit was worn by
Mrs. V. Cornaga with a beech-brown
straw beret-type hat. A small brown hat
toned with Mrs. Massey Burnside’s
brown-and-white printed silk frock. Mrs.
Mary Ham’s light-blue sleeveless pleated
frock was topped with a wide leghorn
hat. Duck-egg-blue frock and large leg-
horn straw hat made a cool-looking com-
bination for Mrs. Nigel Prichard. Mar-
jorie Gluth’s paisley silk frock was worn
under a delphinium-blue hip-length
jacket.
The Gymkhana held at Ranelagh to
raise funds for Toorak College attracted
a host of good riders, among them quite
a number of girls from the college. A
group of enthusiastic women worked
hard to make it the financial success it
was. Mrs. E. B. Coles was in charge of
refreshments; the lucky envelopes were
the care of Mesdames Tony Fairbairn
and Douglas Carnegie ; Mesdames Max
Armstrong and Robin Hope directed the
produce stall; Lady Hyde was respons-
ible for the excellent publicity; Mes-
dames Herbert and Rau had charge of
the well-stocked apron stall. Among the
visitors were Mrs. Bill Stocks, Jill
Foster, Helen Lade, Judy Pryde, Jenny
McMillan, Mary Hope Campbell and
Mrs. Leo Quick. •
A cream-and-pale-gold color-scheme
was chosen by Joan Denyer for her
marriage with Jack Morris at the Mel-
bourne Grammar School Chapel,
and repeated in the wedding cake
and decorations at the New Alex-
andra, where the reception was held.
Joan, who is the only child of Mr. and
Mrs. R. W. Denyer, of East St. Kilda,
wore a pale-gold lame gown with a train
fashioned of folds of deep-cream tulle.
A veil of matching tulle was held in place
with a small coronet of gold crinoline
straw, and she carried a bouquet of
cream-and-gold water-lilies. Mrs. Eric
Rogers, who was matron-of-honor, wore
a gown of ivory chiffon over gold and a
small gold crinoline straw halo. She also
carried water-lilies in cream-and-gold
tonings. The bridegroom, who is the son
of the late Mr. and Mrs. Louis Morris,
formerly of Melbourne, had Noel Bergere
as best man.
Receiving the guests with her husband,
Mrs. Denyer wore a gown of pink lame
and a small halo hat of the same material.
Among the guests were Mr. and Mrs. L.
Jameson, she wearing a gown of dusty-
pink crepe with a peplum skirt; their
daughter Greba, who set off her titian
coloring with a black net, gold-
embroidered frock and small black hat
with a waist-length veil; Mrs* J. James,
who wore a three-quarter-length floral
silk jacket over a black chiffon frock ;
Diana Currie, whose slim-fitting frock
was of ice-blue slipper satin; Mrs. Peter
Randall in a frock of white crepe pat-
terned with pink and green flowers and
Mrs. Dennis Ayr in blue-and-silver lame.
An engagement of inter-State interest
is that of Margaret, only daughter of Mrs.
Angas, Hill River, Clare, S.A., and the
late Dudley Angas, to Alan, second son
of Mr. and Mrs. H. R. Hamer, of Toorak.
Margaret, who has just completed her
course in aeronautical engineering and

mother will be the guests of Mr. and
Mrs. Hamer when they visit Melbourne
shortly.

In the years ahead it will be the relative
levels of turnover and costs that deter-
mine the measure of brewery profits, and
costs promise to be the more rigid of the
two. Still, history shows that in the ups-
and-downs of the business cycle the trade
holds relatively well, and that means
much.
With the economic barometer high
and rising, owing to pressure of a buoy-
ant national income, inflated by fat prices
and ready markets for exports, and “full”
employment at high and rising wage
rates, consumption of beer has gone up,
too. The following comparison of
Federal excise collections on beer gives
some idea of what has happened;
Year to Year to
June 30. June 30.
1939.. £7,842,257f 1943.. £19,632,695t
1940.. 8,838,926 f 1944.. 21,615,974 f

1947.. 27,246,527*
f Federal Statistician’s figures. * Budget figures.
Growth last year was £4,726,917, approxi-
mately 21 p.c., and the Treasury expects
a further increase of £254,000 in total
collections for 1947-48. Excise per gal-
lon ascended by irregular steps from Is,
9d. in 1939 to 4s. 7d. in 1942, and has
remained steady since. The Government
now makes off with 14s. 7d. of every
pound the brewer receives for bulk beer.
The other ss. sd. has to cover the whole
cost of production, distribution, admini-
stration and taxation, as \yell as profits,
which the Treasurer raids again as divi-
dends in the hands of shareholders.
Appearances are that consumption is
• approaching its peak, while exes, continue
to climb at a disquieting rate. Since the
close of accounts sugar has gone up id.
per pound, the price of hops, barley and
other materials has risen, too, and so
have the basic wage and margins for skill,
and the 40-hour week has further aggra-
vated the management’s troubles—’apart
from the effect of the time factor on
costs, the shorter working week is equiva-
lent to a 10 p.c. lift in hourly wage-
rates. On the other hand, abolition of
War-time (Co.) Tax will help offset the
growth in exes. Still, it all tends to push
prospects of a lift in the div. into the
background, for the time being at any
rate.
Last term the co.’s gross earnings and
exes, both went up with a rush, leaving
a net gain of only £2946;
1940. 1945. 1946. 1947.

All that was after providing for depre-
ciation, taxation and other contingencies.
Maintenance of plant, etc., which is re-
ported in a “high state of efficiency,” was
charged against current revenue. The
£158,973 of profit claimed—second-best
in the last 18 years—was 9.7 p.c. on
capital as against 9, 8.8, 8.6, 8.6, 8.3, 7.8
and 9.8 p.c. back to 1940. The div. was
kept at 8 p.c., making the average 8.4 p.c.
over the last decade.
When materials and’ labor become
available the rebuilding, remodelling and
extension of the brewery and of hotel
premises will call for substantial outlay,
to meet which cash, etc., is being built

four times the amount visibly allowed
for depreciation. The amount coming to
sundry creditors, etc., includes an un-

subsidiary, which are a domestic matter,
the year’s improvement in the more or

Pre-war Australia figured in world
markets mainly as a seller of raw
materials and foodstuffs and as a buyer
of manufactured and processed goods.
Today she has joined the ranks of
countries seeking export markets for their
manufactures. That is because war
brought big changes in the direction and
flow of international trade and in the
development and structure of Australian
industry, much of which has now
reached, or will shortly reach, an ad-
vanced stage of growth in which the
local market will prove too small to
absorb full output.
In many cases plant installed for
war purposes has been „ converted
to production of civilian lines, and
further additions are being made. When
the present backlog of demand in the
home and British markets is overtaken
pressure to find other outlets will increase,
and will have to be found, if production,
employment and the standard of living
are to be maintained at a high level.
It is largely to Asiatic countries, in the
arc from Egypt to Japan, that Australia
will have to look for future markets.
Here opportunity will ripen when the
countries concerned achieve political
stability and settle into an economic pro-
gramme that will enable them to buy
more goods from abroad. Australian
manufacturers are ready and anxious to
seize and exploit the opportunity—and
so are their opposite numbers in the U.S.
and Canada.
Whether we catch or miss the
bus is a matter now largely in the
hands of the Government, which controls
practically everything these days. Pros-
pects have to be weighed against a back-
ground of rising costs, transport and other
difficulties. The load of costs has just
been increased by 10 p.c. or more through
introduction of the 40-hour week, while
the position is aggravated by the high
level of company tax, a decline in output
per man-hour, shortage of labor and
materials, especially coal, unwillingness
to work overtime and tall freight-rates
and irregular deliveries, owing to strikes
and other hold-ups. With official
emphasis on expenditure instead of pro-
duction and wage-price co-ordination the
danger remains one of price-inflation,
which weakens the competitive power of
industry and the purchasing-power of the
workers. ’
Rosella, an efficient and enterprising
organisation which operates three fac-
tories in Vic., two in N.S.W., one in S.
Aus. and another in Tas., had built up
strong and growing connections with
Asia pre-war. And, provided the Govern-
ment refrains from placing too many
obstacles in the co.’s path, its prospects
of re-establishing and expanding this
trade are encouraging. Because recent
international tariff agreements are likely
to affect exports of Australian canned
fruits to Britain, modification of plans
for extension of the co.’s factory at
Tatura (Vic.) is under consideration.
However, local and British demand con-
tinues to run ahead of output, plant used
on lend-lease or rental terms has been
bought, and permits obtained to import
high-speed machines from U.S.
Improvement in last year’s -gross earn-
ings (£330,361) was £15,959. Exes.
(£264,237, including allowances for de-
preciation and taxation) took £14,339 of
the increase. The net result was thus £1620
better at £66,124, the best yet. It was
16.5 p.c. on capital as against 16.1, 15.8,
13.9, 13.6, 13.4, 13.9, 14.1 and 14.2 p.c.
back to 1939. The div. was kept at 10 p.c.,
making the average over the last 29 years
approximately 11 p.c.
The co. is well-ribbed financially:

The latest result underlines the com-
pleteness of A. W. Allen’s recovery from
the unhappy start which kept it in a con-
valescent condition for two decades.
Soon after the co. had embarked on a
big expansion programme in 1922
(financed by £130,000 new pref, capital),
it became evident that confectionery-
makers were overproviding for the
public’s sweet-tooth, trading became in-
tensely competitive and Allen’s drifted
into the red. A drastic reconstruction
narrowed the co.’s range of manufacture
to specialty lines, enabling it to vacate
a large section of its premises, thereafter
leased to tenants ; intangible assets and
accumulated deficit were rubbed out by
writing down the ordinary shares from
20s. to 6d. each.
The business was again on a profitable
basis by 1929. Payment of the “A” pref.
dividend arrears began four years later
and was completed in 1939 ; payment of
“B” arrears began in 1939 and ended in
1944; then the ords. came back, into
the picture after a lapse of 20 years,
v Finances have steadily been streng-
thened. The co. has retained the unusual
capital-gearing adopted in 1928, but each
sixpenny ord. is now backed by 19s. Bd.
in net tangible assets:

Current assets exceed liabilities by
£114,872, an improvement of £13,137
over the last twelvemonth. The increased
liquidity takes the form of cash (up
£35,494) at the expense of stocks (down
£8104) and debtors (down £4599), because
lack of female labor and of packing
material is making it hard to maintain
output even at war-time levels, and de-
mand for the co.’s products is outpacing
new supplies.
An improvement of £3690 in last year’s
gross trading profit was more than offset
by increased costs, but the latter include
a tax provision of £24,000 which is now
“more than sufficient,” the chairman says,

Net profit increased by £2OBB thanks to a
rise of £2999 in dividend-income, which
was not preceded by any expansion of
the co.’s shareholdings (£19,552).
The co.’s fine record of rehabilitation
in the ’thirties suggests it will be able to
answer for itself when competition re-
turns to the confectionery trade. Tax-
relief should help future earnings con-
siderably, but working costs will probably
be higher this term. Both classes of prefs.
have 9 p.c. cumulative dividend rights, re-
quiring a yearly allotment of £11,700.
At latest price of 365. for each type,
yield would be 5 p.c., and the shares have
net backing of 675. 1 Id. and 765. Bd. each
respectively. The Is. 6d. div. for the
ords, represents 7 \ p.c. on their original
face-value (300 p.c. on the present), and
would provide a 5.2 p.c. yield on shares
bought at 295. each.
Zinc Investments, Ltd.
This holding co. has £250,000 of capital
to feed in 4s. shares. At end June last
reserves totalled only £5917. For the
three years to the close of accounts in
1946 net earnings averaged £11,347, or
4.54 p.c. on capital, and shareholders re-
ceived a regular 5 p.c. For the year to
June 30 last the profit was £11,228 (down
£120), the div. was lowered to 41 p.c.
(£11,250), and it is doubtful whether
better need be expected.
When the books last closed, chief asset
was 196,367 f.-p. £1 shares in Associated
Pulp and Paper, Ltd. —it paid a steady
6 p.c. p.a. over the last seven years, with
only £4813 to spare last term. Govern-
ment securities totalled £18,200 (down
£3012) and cash £5486 (up £2099).
Sundry creditors, provision for taxation
and unclaimed divs. amounted to £1393.
The co, also holds 119,250 B shares of
17s, Bd. each —36,000 of them paid to
13s. 6d. each and the balance fully-paid—
in Minerals Separation and De Bavay's
Processes, which hasn’t paid a div. for
years, owing to expiry of patents. What
these shares are worth, if anything, the
“Wild Cat” doesn’t know, the curtain

In July last Associated Pulp
and Paper issued 1,600,000 new
£1 shares, one-for-one, at par.
That was to help finance instal-
lation of two more paper
machines, erect a sawmilling
plant to cut pulpwood and
building and furniture timbers,
and further develop the co.’s
forest areas. The second ma-
chine is not expected to be run-
ning until 1950, Instead of tak-
ing up its proportion of the new
issue (196,367 shares), Zinc In-
vestments offered the shares pro
rata to those on its own
register. This was in the nature
of a bonus because of the
premium at which Pulp and
Paper scrip stood in the market.
The paids recently fetched
365, 6d. On this basis, and dis-
regarding the holding in
Minerals Separation altogether,
Zinc Investments’ net assets are
equal to 6s. Id. per 4s. share. At
4s. lOd.—last recorded sale —
these 4s. shares return 3.7 p.c.
on a 4j p.c. div. basis.
From a man on the spot:
Successful flotation of Mount
Eba Gold Mines, Ltd., in Syd-
ney surprised Westralian old-
timers, and payment by specu-
lators of over 100 p.c. premium
for shares surprised them still
more. The block held by the co,
is in a locality where one would
not expect to find even a small
permanent mine. In the early
days, development showed the
shoots to be irregular, short and
shallow-seated. Trying to make
money out of them pushed the
General Gordon, N.L., into an
early insolvent’s grave. The
seven vendors include two Kal-
goorlie Golden Mile mine man-
agers, Jim Hilton of Gt. Boulder
and Tommy Greenhill of the
Paringa. Although not indepen-
dent, reports on Mt, Eba by
them would be of interest to
shareholders. Not one of the
vendors is on the board,
* * * ♦
“O.B.”: Work on the princi-
pal Westralian goldmines
threatens to be retarded by
scarcity of labor in the firewood-
fuel industry, owing to the de-
parture of a large number of
Yugoslavs for their homeland.
State Government has asked the
Commonwealth to find more
workers, presumably European
immigrants, to fill the gap.
* * * ♦
Rather than see the mine
closed down and the dependent
township of Agnew vanish, Wes-
tralian Government is finding
£3OOO to keep the Emu workings
unwatered until the fate of an
attempt to raise more capital is
known. Emu is one of the De
Bernales Westralian gold group
out of whose production share-
holders have received nothing.
When known as the Waroonga
it was operated by a now-defunct
London co., which gave up
when a rise in wages, which the
directors said they could not
afford to pay, was granted by
the Arbitration Court.

Unlucky Blue Spec at
Nullagine still has treat-
ment troubles. Shortage of
chemicals and plant stoppages
for readjustments are blamed,
and “every effort is being made
to put things right.” From a re-
cent crushing of 1158 short tons
ore, head value 16dwt., only
140 oz. gold was recovered, of
which 220 z. came from the resi-
dues.

More good developments at
Mountain View, Day Dawn
(W.A.), are announced. A syn-
dicate obtained several rich
yields last year, and the mine is
now being worked by a Perth
public co. Some mining men
say that the “View” shoot is a
continuation of that in adjoining
ground from which the now-
dead-and-gone Great Fingall
Corp. got millions of pounds
worth of bullion.
* * * *
Eight years ago Wiluna
(W.A.) had an estimated popu-
lation of 7000; now it has only
about 700. Reason is the clos-
ing-down of its two gold-pro-
ducers, Wiluna and Moonlight
Wiluna mines. To the end of
1947 the value of the former’s
output ran into eight figures
and the latter’s seven. In addi-
tion to gold production Wiluna
has been the largest yielder of
arsenic and antimony in the
Commonwealth.

SUNDRY SHOWS
Australian Grand
Opera.
Stripped of the lovely arias
between Rhadames and * Aida,
the hymn to Isis and the haunt-
ing farewell to earth of the
slave-girl and the general in the
crypt at Memphis, “Aida” would
be scarcely distinguishable from
a Tiv. show. If it seems better,
it is only because it is seen in
conjunction with the music.
When the Egyptian priest-
hood, Ethiopian p.-0.-w.,
eunuchs, dancing-girls and slaves
bearing dog-faced gods, cocka-
too-faced gods and other sym-
bols of the religion of the
Pharaohs filed upon the large
stage of Melbourne Princess for
the opening of the season of
Australian grand opera and for
the welcome home of the vic-
torious Rhadames, it only
needed some slight anachronism
to bring the spectacle momen-
tarily tumbling down in ruins.
This was provided by a trum-
peter wearing glasses.
None of the absurdities of
grand panto, however, could
militate against the general ex-
cellence of the performance.
Verdi wrote the work on com-
mission for the Khedive at Cairo,
and the Khedive wanted a grand
show. Verdi gave him that and
couldn’t help pouring into it
seme marvellous music.
There were plenty of talented
singers to give it passage. Betna
Pontin, as the unhappy slave-
girl, was the surprise of the even-
ing. She combined appealing
acting with a voice of great
sweetness which should gain in
power with practice. In the
course of the musical dialectics
between her and the frantically
jealous Amneris (Justine Ret-
tick) she reached great heights.
An equally striking figure was
Maxwell Cohen as her father,
the captive Ethiopian monarch.
Clad in a leopard-skin and
visibly palpitating with emotion,
he brought forth a voice of
great strength, volume and feel-
ing in the impassioned arias \yith
his bewildered daughter. Fred-
erick Collier, as the bloodthirsty
high-priest, was ecclesiastical
hate incarnate. As Rhadames,
Harry Jenkins was a disappoint-
ment. He never seemed to get
into the part of the soldier who
sacrifices his army for his girl
friend, and his voice was un-
musical, though powerful.
Dr. Herman Schildberger de-
serves credit for the fine edge
he stropped on to the singing of
the female chorus, particularly
thrilling when it floated faintly
in the air on the moonlit banks
of the Nile in the third act. In
manipulating the conjoint forces
of the orchestra, choruses and
solos, Joseph Post, conducting
his second opera in 15 years,
did a great job. Jean Alexan-
der’s ballets, allegedly based on
ancient Egyptian motives,
weren’t of the same high order.
The final scene, when Rha-
dames, having been walled in
with his love, sings his farewell
to earth, while Amneris, above,
although unaware of their pre-
sence, mysteriously harmonises
with them, was remarkably
effective.
"Giselle."
The first act of “Giselle,”
particularly the scene, or dance,
where the maiden goes mad
after discovering that she cannot
marry Albrecht, is always a
temptation for the dancer to
show herself as a dramatic act-
ress rather than a dancer. The
dance should be a pathetic repe-
tition of her earlier happy dance
with Albrecht in the same
act —Dorothy Stevenson did
it admirably three or four
years ago with the Borovanskys
—but it is more often, and
wrongly, performed as a “mad-
ness scene,” a kind of his-
trionic climax to the act.
Edna Busse gave it that interpre-
tation in the recent Borovansky
season in Sydney, and Sally Gil-
mour does much the same in the
current performance by the
Ballet Rambert at Sydney Tiv,
It’s a pity, because it brings a
realistic note to a ballet whicjji,
to preserve its essential fairy-
tale quality, should never in-
clude such deliberate interpre-
tation.
The technical excellence of
the Rambert performance —of
Sally Gilmour as Giselle, of
Walter Gore as Albrecht, and
Joyce Graeme as Queen of the
Wilis —is unquestionable, but
even with that undoubted
superiority they miss that in-
tangible haunting quality which
the Borovanskys achieved with
lesser dancing. In some respects,
however, the Rambert perform-
ance is much more satisfying
than the abbreviated Borovan-
sky version. In particular, the
longer second act gives the male
dancer much more scope and
significance, opportunities which
Walter Gore uses for some
magnificent dancing.
The Bluebird pas de deux
from “Aurora’s Wedding” is
simply an exhibition of dancing,
and Belinda Wright and John
Gilpin make it exactly that —an
exquisite, breathtakingly beauti-
ful exhibition.
,“G a 1 a Performance” con-
cludes the current Rambert pro-
gramme. It’s a boisterous and
slightly obvious satire on ballet
and, indirectly, on the theatre,
depicted in the rivalry between
three ballerinas, both before and
after the curtain goes up. Sara
Luzita, Brenda Hamlyn and
Margaret Scott interpret the
piece with graceful drollery.
"Blithe Spirit."
A list of the best plays seen
in Sydney over the last decade
would have to include Coward’s
“Blithe Spirit,” and a list of the
best acting would have to in-
clude that of Bettina Welch as
the ghost of Mr, Condamine’s
first wife in that play, it’s the
kind of humorous performance
that seems perfect, both in sepul-
chral speech and ghostly ges-
ture, and the temptation is
strong to set it as a standard
for anyone who essays the role.
The play, with Missj Welch, is
having a brief return season at
Sydney Royal until March 3,
when it is expected that Cicely
Courtneidge will be back on
deck, or “Under the Counter,”
or wherever she is in that light,
bright confection.
Lloyd Lamble plays the hus-
band who is plagued by the
ghost of his first wife and,
eventually, by the ghost of his
second as well. He was given
the role three days before the
play opened, and, if he lacks
a little of the polish necessary
to polish-off Mr. Coward, he
still turns in a remarkably credit-
able performance. Aileen Brit-
ton is the second Mrs. Conda-
mine, Wilma Harrison the mis-
chievous maid and Letty Cray-
don the enthusiastic medium
who conjures up all the pother.
They are all as blithely enter-
taining as anyone could wish.
At the Films.
“Cine Ma”: Over a quarter
of a century of picturegoing has
left me more bewildered than
ever as to the censors’ scales of
values. Consider, for example,
a film at Melbourne Capitol
with the intriguing title “The
Two Mrs. Carrolls.”
“Passion and hatred, fused
into murder” are the main at-
tractions, according to the cap-
tions, though there are some irri-
tatingly brief glimpses of a lovely
cathedral city. Humphrey
Bogart, an artist—and a poor
one judging by his pictures—
keeps on marrying and murder-
ing his spouses. He falls senti-
mentally in love with a beautiful
young woman, and when he
goes home to his equally-beauti-
ful wife he starts hating her and
scheming for her removal.
Having successfully removed her
with a potion obtained from a
blackmailing chemist whom he
also murders he marries the new
girl and in due course falls
sentimentally in love with
another beautiful young lady.
Landru or Leonski or the
latest Parisian horror may be the
model for this hero, but there is
no attempt to give the psycho-
logical background for his
strange behavior, though the
fact that he invariably paints a
portrait of his victim looking
like a death’s-head just before he
kills her may be a clumsy effort
in this direction. An awful feel-
ing of depression settled on the
house when 1 viewed the picture,
which is labelled “suitable for
adults.”
* * * *
Orson Welles’s acting is gener-
ally characterised by an air of
intense preoccupation —as
though he were wondering all
the time what it was that he had
to bring home for dinner.
Attempting to reform “The Lady
from Shanghai” (Rita Hay-
worth) he delivers to Sydney
Victory a holdful of seafaring
philosophy in a deep Killarney
brogue which fits him like the
lacing kind. But Rita didn’t
leave Shanghai for nothing, and
despite Welles’s attempts to save
her, comes to a sticky end shoot-
ing it out with her husband,
admirably played by Everett
Sloan. There Orson leaves the
pair, spluttering their last, and
walks slowly out of the gun-
smoke into sunshine, possibly
still puzzled whether it was
chops or cutlets.
* * * *
“Where There’s Life” there is
Bob Hope, in this case at Syd-
ney State. He becomes the
crown prince of Barovia, a
country peopled by seriously-
wounded ex-crown princes,
female generals and gentlemen
with .45-calibre walking-sticks.
Towards the finish of the film,
Bob is seriously doubting the
truth of its title and, in such
strife, he’s always at his best.
sic sic Sic Sic
Shirley Temple has a fair way
to go before she can liquidate
all the crimes of her childhood,
but by providing good light
comedy with Franchot Tone, in
“Honeymoon,” at Sydney
fair, she shows that she is try-
ing hard.
* * * *
There is no pot of gold at
the “End of the Rainbow” —
merely a pot. Nelson Eddy has
developed a beaut, in recent
years and looks as if a stiff game
of croquet would prostrate him.
He is cast as a dashing captain
of cavalry who bursts into song
at every opportunity and rides
and acts like a sack of potatoes.

Here is Mr. Colin Galbraith’s yacht, “Kyeema,”
point score winner for the Ist Division Yachts
in Sydney Harbour. On the left you will read
what Mr. Galbraith says of “KOPLASTIK” Anti-
Fouling for wooden vessels.
Another yacht to use “KOPLASTIK” is the
big 65 foot gaff schooner “Mistral,” which was
slipped after twelve months in Sydney Harbour,
having previously been coated with this
amazing, new-type Anti-Fouling. The hull was
entirely clean. No marine growth! No teredo!
After twelve months!
This clearly demonstrates that the bugbears of
bottom fouling and deadly teredo attack have
been solved by Jackson’s “KOPLASTIK,” the
new-type Anti-Fouling for wooden vessels.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Sprinters from South Australia have
made notable forays on Melbourne
in the past, and, with Royal Gem,
Money Moon, Galway Pipe and
Comedy Prince all (at time of writing)
representing it, the good work could
well be continued in the Newmarket.
The fine form of these alone, apart
from the rest with fair prospects,
makes the first leg of the big double
look even more open than usual.
Royal Gem ran a grand race in the
Futurity at Caulfield last Saturday.
Shortly before coming over he won
just as convincingly at six furlongs;
in this event nearly falling, yet cover-
ing the distance in 1.11. He ran
the Futurity seven furlongs in t,he
equally smart time of 1.24-}, only the
fraction outside the course record.
Moreover; he carried his 10.2 as if
it was a featherweight in running
down the flyaway Star Port in the
straight, giving that gelding 2st. It
was a very good field; Money Moon
third, and such as Columnist, Chanak,
and Hindu Prince among the also-
rans.
Royal Gem is certainly versatile,
having won at practically all distances'
from five furlongs to the Caulfield
Cup mile-and-a-half; but, though
Bernborough won both Futurity and
Newmarket, Royal Gera’s natural
progress would now seem to be to-
wards longer rather than shorter dis-
tances, not overlooking the exacting
nature of the Newmarket “straight
six.’’ It does call for stamina, but
the greatest requirement in it remains
sprinting speed. Money Moon, too,
might be at his best at a longer dis-
tance; but both of them are hard to
pass over.
Comedy Prince should sprint the
Newmarket six really well, though
he’s now getting all the weight his
good record warrants. Star Port led
them in dazzling s'tyle in the Futurity,
in which Hindu Prince and Chanak
finished close to the place-getters,
Chanak running a bit wide at the
turn. Prince Curl’s unlucky third
in the Oakleigh Plate will not be
forgotten; Greensborough (8,9) and
Riyer Hero (8.8) look very nicely
weighted; Tahmoor, penalised 61b. for
his Oakleigh win, is still well in with
8.4, and Flemish is yet another with
the form to win.
One of the most impressive of New-
market trials was Galway Pipe’s ex-
cellent run in the Oakleigh; only very
narrowly beaten, and a protest de-
cided against him. He was finishing
on; the extra half-furlong should suit
him well. Perhaps Chanak, who is
passing over the St. Leger in favor
of the short race, for which he
appears to have been set by trainer
J. Holt, measures up as well as any
on speed plus stamina. So, for what
looks a decidedly tough Newmarket:
Chanak, 1; Galway Pipe, 2; Flemish,
Even more interest than the
Futurity attracted centred on, the
meeting of the Law Maker colt
Ungar and the St. Magnus colt Scot-
wyn in the six-furlongs Merson
Cooper Stakes. Scotwyn was odds-on
favorite, but Ungar overhauled him
in the straight and convincingly beat
him. Another Law Maker, the filly
Head Mistress, was third. Time,
I.ll}. Ungar should not be beaten
in the Sires’ Produce Stakes next
Saturday; by the oversight of his sire
not being nominated, the colt won’t
be in the Sydney Sires’ Produce. v
The St. Magnus breed came good
in the mile Stanley Plate for three-
year-olds, with the brown colt Trumps
downing Dumfries and Colin’s Pride.
Westralian (the W.A. Derby winner)
ran prominently most of the way.
Takitimo, winner of a division of the
St. Clair Trial, is another St. Magnus.
The first division of the Trial went
to the Talking mare Loose Talk.
Shaping well of late, the Manitoba
four-year-old mare Amelia repeated
her last-year’s success in the 12-
furlongs Woodclifl; Handicap, com-
fortably defeating Lungi and Laudate.
She carried 8.11, and a 71b. penalty
has raised her Australian Cup weight
to 8.12. Lungi looks next-best to
Fresh Boy for the St. Leger.
* * * *
What a boon the camera is to
racing! Wherever the photo.-finish
gear has been installed the yahoo
assault on the ears oyer decisions
has been stilled. How much nasti-
ness has thus been swept away was
evident in the hullabaloo after the
judge’s dead-heat verdict on the Fly-
ing at Moorefield. It could, of course,
be argued that that vocal ugliness was
never much worse than the visual
ugliness of the structures housing the
cameras.
The Moorefield shindy was over
Brazier (W. Briscoe) being given as
dead-heating with Trover (R. Sel-
krig). Brazier was a solidly-backed
second favorite, at 5 to 1; Trover
was a forlorn outsider, at 50 to 1.
Needless to add, the shindy-makers
reckoned Brazier won. However,
apart from the pocket angle, from
their visual angle that would be
natural. Actually, from the members’
stand Trover appeared to win. The
judge’s decision quite satisfied con-
nections of both horses.
It was the day’s second dead-heat,
Casanova (J. Thompson) and Prince
Verity (W. Cook) having crossed the
line with nothing between them in
the 10-furlongs Mixed Stakes. Two
divisions of the mile Mixed Stakes
were won by Chief Mohican (A.
Ward) and Ozonian (Cook). A point
about these events is the rarity of
wins by horses that have reached the
top weight of 9st. by the progressive
scale of weighting according to wins.
It’s done in 71b. rises, beginning with
7.7 for maidens; and it might be that
the final 71b. rise is too rough a
method of “handicapping” for the
general class of horses that compete.
The most notable performance of
the day was jockey Ward’s treble, he
also winning the Two-year-old on Pax
Vqbis (a neck too good for the
heavily-burdened So Sweet), and the
10-furlongs Moorefield Handicap on
Piccadilly Lad (a head better than
Laudus). Exalted (H. Darke) downed
Chatlock and Penmcuik in the Welter,

Wcstralia’s Sheffield Shield winners
further made themselves a force to
be reckoned with henceforth by lead-
ing India on the first innings at Perth,
270 to 252. South Aus. gave Victoria
407 to chase in their Shield (or post-
Shield) encounter in Melbourne; Vic-
toria chasing very lamely, with seven
gone for only 127 when play ended
on Saturday. Dooland, the unlucky
"There, lovey, I'll kiss it and make it better !”
one of the Test selecting, bowled 4
for 68.
The M.C.C. players led by
“Gubby” Allen have been in a bad
patch of injuries and sickness in West
Indies. Up to last week no fewer
than eight of them were aside for
repairs; Hutton was sent to help
them out and press-co-respondent
Crawford White, of the “News
Chronicle,” was enticed to put on
the pads. It recalls the 1888 Aus-
tralian XI to England when casualties
led to Sammy Woods (of Manly,
N.S.W.), then of Cambridge and
Somerset, being called in.

Olympic winter-sports events being
somewhat out of Australia’s line, little
has come out about them, but they’ve
been held at St. Moritz; very nice, too,
as a London “Times” extract will
indicate: “Twenty-five ladies carried
through their free-skating pro-
gramme on the Stadium this after-
noon. Ba-bara Ann Scott is the
champion. It was a wonderful sight;
in the whole of the vast arena there
was not a vacant seat, and on the
surrounding crags spectators in vivid
colors stood out against the snow,
making the scene one of great
beauty.”
John Treloar looked more than
ever Australia’s best Olympic bet
when he ran the 100 yards on Syd-
ney Cricket Ground in 9.5 .(an “assist-
ing wind” barring it as a record).
Morris Curotta (who fell when lead-
ing in Melbourne) covered the 440
in 47|, running right away from
Bartram. Curotta also won the junior
100 yards in 9.7/10.

An old sculling champion has
passed on in Sydney—T. Harrison
Bourke, Australia’s amateur cham-
pion of the skiffs in 1901, ’O2 and
’O3. Going to England for the
Diamond Sculls in 1906, when that
year’s winner, Blackstaff, beat him,
he stayed on, became a life member
of the Thames Rowing Club, and
also a Fellow of the London Char-
tered Accountants. Back in Australia
in 1924, he opened a branch of
Edward L. Lumley and Sons, Lloyds
brokers, in Adelaide. Bourke hailed
originally from Tassie and learnt his
sculling there.

Oxford’s crew, getting ready for
‘‘the boat-race,” has two Australians
in it: L. S. Williams, of Scots, Syd-
ney, and G. C. Fiske, of Geelong.

liams is the second-heftiest of the
eight.

The peaty flavor of the names of
winner Costello and runner-up De
Valera in that notable sporting event
the Irish elections, and the fragrance
of heather lingering about Gonzales
Videla rechristening a lump of the
Antarctic O’Higgins Land, are
matched by the tine old woad cling-
ing to the English team in the world’s
table-tennis championship. As Lon-
don “Times” reported, “England’s
chances of team and individual suc-
cesses” in those championships were
“rated more highly than ever be-
fore.” Reason: “For the first time
England will have R. Bergmann and
V. Barna, two former world cham-
pions, now both naturalised English-
men, playing in the team.” St.
George for ever 1 But it was no good
—the Yanks stitched them. Aus-
tralia, of course, has its chess cham-
pions Koshnitzky (born in gum-
bowered Kishinev in Russia) and
Steiner, from the golden-wattle
avenues of Budapest.

South Australian Ray Kay (9.0)
was never within cooee of beating
Ken Wenman (8.124) at Leichhardt.

down a couple of times and took a
severe body-pasting. Wenman very
easily on points.

Whatever their measure as boxers,
abo. scrappers, practically without
exception, have been gifted with a
hearty wallop; and mainly by virtue
of that gift Queensland bantam Elly
Bennett (8.7) made short work of

almost as often as Elly hit him.

Sharemarket Weaker
Share prices slipped again on
Australian ’Changes last week,
8.H.P., which had recovered to
485., changing hands at under
465. Mr, Chifley’s stand on the
question of company tax ap-
peared to kill any hope of relief
from that impost, and the uncer-
tainty of the overseas situation,
on the importing as well as the
selling side, made investors
rather hesitant. Furthermore,
the speculative vigor that had
grown in stature as; a result of
many months of unbroken
strength in the market took a
severe jolt right from the time
of the first slump three weeks
or so ago, and the buying mar-
ket today is more exclusively the
reserve of investors.
The N.Z. Forest Products’
£1,250,000 issue of 4 J 2 - p.c. de-
bentures went off badly, 63 p.c.
of it being left with the under-
writers.
But. the cheap-money policy
still prevails in the Common-
wealth, and the yield obtain-
able from Tooth shares (about
3.5 p.c.) is not unreasonably
low in present circumstances,
especially in view of price-con-
trol and discriminatory com-
pany taxation. B.H.P. yields
less than 3 p.c., but a
higher div. and/or a new
issue is expected in this case.
Bradford Cotton’s 3.7 p.c. return
is quite attractive at last week’s
market of 545. for the ords.
Yarra Falls, the big woollen tex-
tile concern, shows 4 p.c. at
635. so long as the 12£ p.c. div.
is paid.
Continued weakness in the
market will present investors
with opportunities. A stock
worth watching is Masonite
Corp., which has again reduced
the price of its product in spite
of the big demand.
The real value of shares de-
pends largely upon their future
dividend yields, though, in the
representative cases already
quoted, present returns are not
much out of keeping with gilt-
edged rates. In a progressive
economy in which forces of
supply and demand operated
more freely the more efficient
and older-established concerns
should reap a reward for their
comparative low capitalisation
by present-day standards; and
we should not be afraid of
sharemarket behavior overseas
provided the fall in wheat, wool,
metal and dairy-produce prices
is not precipitous. Wheat may
be adequately produced within
the next two years, but most
other commodities seem less
likely to be in plentiful supply.
Monetary inflation has not
yet ceased in Australia, Britain
or the United States. Until it
does the pressure under all
prices, including those of equity
shades, is likely to be strong.
There are to be a number of
large new Australian industrial
issues this year, but in most
cases existing shareholders will
have priority of allotment.
Company Taxation
Mr. Chifley, if his lengthy
apology for maintaining present
rates of company taxation is any
indication, dbes not intend to
give companies tax relief. He
quoted figures purporting to show
that companies, collectively,
maintained their proportion of
the “national income” in each
year’s earnings, and that net
company earnings, after pay-
ment of taxes, had increased
from £73 million in 1938-39
to £B7 million in 1946-47,
The taxes taken into ac-
count in arriving at this net
figure are called “non-personal
direct taxes,” representing “in-
come taxes, undistributed-profits
taxes and war-time (company)
tax,” but it is not clear whether
they include private-company
tax assessed under Division 7
of the Act.
Mr. Chifley provided the fol-
lowing comparative figures,
covering all companies:

Income. Taxes. Income, dents.

1944- 138 60 78 - 30
1945- 135 55 80 32
1946- 140 53 87 35
It will be noted that the in-
crease in net company earnings
over the eight-year period was
£l4 million, or 19 p.c. That
does not take into account the
increase in the amount of share-
holders’ funds employed in earn-
ing the profits, and it makes no
allowance* for the depreciation
in value of money.
Nor, so far as shareholders in
public companies are concerned,
does it acknowledge the fact that
in 1939 taxes paid by companies
were allowed as a rebate in the
hands of shareholders if their
own personal rate was above the
company rate —the rebate was
abolished by the Menzies Gov-
ernment purely as a matter of
war-time necessity, and was
never considered to be entirely
equitable. If a company be re-
garded as a trustee for the pri-
vate citizens forming it, then
there is no question that share-
holders in Australian companies
today are subject to a very severe
form of double taxation.
By comparison with company
income and taxes, personal in-
comes in 1946-47 were £1261
million, of which direct taxes
took £167 million, leaving £1094
million net. The 1938-39 figures
were £746 million, £33 million
and £713 million net. The war-
time growth in the total of net
personal incomes has been 53
“You can use it either for your shoes or as suntan lotion."
p.c., compared with the growth,
in the case of companies, of only
19 p.c.
Mr. Chifley has chosen to take
up an attitude of fair play in
this company-tax situation, and
to plead equity. But it is per-
fectly obvious that wage-earners
and other earners of personal in-
comes have received a greatly
inflated net income out of Mr.
Chifley’s “planned” economic
programme for Australia—Mr.
Dedman, who hates “little capi-
talists,” was very joyous about
this during the Budget session—
and the results are clear in the
huge savings-bank accumulations
that have been built up ; where-
as, on his own figures, it will be
found that the savings—that is,
undistributed net profits—of in-
dustry have shown very little
expansion at all.'
It is out of the reinvestment
of profits that the best kind of
industrial expansion is derived,
from which increased production
flows. The Chifley policy has,
instead, added to an already in-
flated public spending-power,
and increased the inflationary
disequilibrium that exists be-
tween production and consump-
tion, or, in better-known terms,
between supply and demand.
Only rigid price-control and
costly subsidies have so far pre-
vented the real inflationary posi-
tion from revealing itself. But
the artificiality of the whole
thing will not be disguised much
longer if world economic forces
once again begin to exercise their
normal sway.
British Costs and Currency
The Attlee Government is
going ahead with its plan to
peg wages at present levels
where increased production
doesn’t come from the wage-
earner, and additional items are
to come within the scope of
price-control, this apparently
satisfying the Trade Union Con-
gress. The Federation of British
Industries has appointed a com-
mittee of 30 to help the Board
of Trade in its efforts to reduce
profits and 1 control prices.
The “freezing” of additional
prices is said to have the dual
aim of stopping the rise in the
cost of living so as to gain more
success from the appeal to
workers for more and less-costly
production and to control “pro-
vocative” increases in profits.
With a reduction in produc-
tion costs and inflation more
under control it is believed that
exports will be stimulated and
the position of sterling
strengthened. It is of great im-
portance to Britain to keep ster-
ling steady, especially during a
period when prices are already
too high. Sterling has lost a
great deal of its buying-power
within Britain, and unless that
trend is stopped it will start
losing it outside, in the official
exchange market as well as on
the “black.”
Australia will have a keen in-
terest in how Britain’s latest ap-
peal for more production and
less inflation makes out, as it
will be upon the success of the
appeal that any change or other-
wise in the London-Australia ex-
change rate will largely depend.
Maoriland Manpower
Taxpayers in New Zealand
are getting more and more
critical of their topheavy public
service, and Maoriland Govern-
me n t heads correspondingly
more sensitive to digs in the
ribs. “Futile indulgence,” was
how Prime Minister Fraser this
month tried to wave aside a
demand by M.L. manufacturers
in annual conference for depart-
mental retrenchments. Up to
this stage manufacturers had left
the Chambers of Commerce to
lire the shots, but factory man-
agements struggling for staffs to
man idle machines couldn’t keep
silent any longer.
Vacant jobs, officially reported
to have mounted from 24,000 to
33,000, wouldn’t be so numerous
if 10 p.c, of State employees (that
is, 9000) were handed notices
and left free to get on private
payrolls. “Our servant —the
State” is the biggest handicap to
M.L.’s industrial effort, with
companies, hospitals and small
employers falling over one an-
other to grab anyone who looks
like an idle worker, above all,
female. M.L. employers com-
pare New Zealand’s average of
one civil servant to every 19 of
the population with John Bull’s
one to every ,64, and say they’re
setting the target low when they
propose a 10 p.c. cut.
The biggest joke is the
National Employment service,
which looksi more like a State
detective-agency to seal the death
of private enterprise than a ser-
vice to help employment. Is it
planning for the day when M.L.
Labor bigwigs hope to be
the sole employers? But long
before that M.L. industry will
be so crushed down by the
weight of bureaucracy that de-
partments will have to be pruned
—and there will be plenty of
deadwood to chop away.

JAVA SEA BATTLE
The Gallant Fight of H.M.A.S. Perth
By "MACNELL"
[lt is six years ago this week since Perth fought its last action against
overwhelming odds in Japan’s early southward military advance .]
To close with the enemy, regardless of
the cost, has been one of the proudest
traditions of the Royal Navy. The Java
Sea battle, in which five Allied cruisers,
two of them British, and a handful of
destroyers deliberately intercepted and
materially damaged a vastly superior
enemy force, deserves a special place in
the long history of gallant sea fights. The
single action of H.M.A.S. Perth, hope-
lessly outnumbered, surrounded by Jap-
anese ships and crippled by enemy fire,
still firing back accurately, has something
of the drama of the story of Grenville
and the Revenge. In another age it
would have become part of our national
tradition, and ballads would have been
written about it.
At the end of February, 1942, the Jap-
anese were sweeping south. Singapore
had fallen, and along the northern coasts
of Sumatra and Java the smoke from
burning oil-tanks, motor-cars, rubber
stocks and ammunition dumps left by the
retreating Allies could be seen plainly
from 20 miles out at sea. These were the
critical months before retreat changed
to “holding warfare,” during which the
Allies built up their strength for the later
offensives.
But at that time the offensive advantage
lay with the enemyln the Java area
there were the 8-inch cruiser Exeter, the
5.9-inch Dutchmen De Ruyter and Java
(the former wearing the flag of the Dutch
Admiral-in-Command, Admiral Door-
man), American Houston and 6-incher
Perth. Their scrfeen was nine destroyers
—four American, two Dutch and three
British, among them brave little Electra.
A Japanese invasion force of about 44
troopships and supply-ships, protected
by approximately 20 cruisers and
destroyers, was sailing towards the north-
east corner of Java, At 2000 hours
(8 p.m.) on Thursday, Ferbuary 28, the
Allied squadron left Souraßaya to inter-
cept them.
The enemy force was expected to be in
sight early Friday morning, and half-
light found all ships at action-stations.
Gradually the Allied line formed from
the dimness of the sea: cruisers De
Ruyter, Exeter, Perth, Java and Houston
in line; the destroyers in a spearhead
formation in front. With full dawn guns’
crews fell out and all armament left was
cleared away for instant action.
Enemy in Sight
All that morning the squadron steamed
steadily, extra lookouts were posted—
radar was in its infancy—and at 1615 the
bridge lookout sighted far ahead two
thin black masts, like pencils, above the
horizon. Then another, and another, to
left and right, until a minute forest came
marching out of the sea towards them.
A single flag was hauled up De Ruyter’s
mast. The 20-knot wind of their passage
caught it and it stood taut as a board.
“Enemy in sight! ”
Almost at once another hoist jerked up
the leader’s port halliards. Deep in
Perth’s bowels engine-room bells clanged
faintly. The sea under her counter
bubbled, then tossed, then churned until
it was like a cauldron of boiling milk.
“Destroyers clear the line of fire!” —
and the little ships milled like a pack of
otters, a kind of orderly confusion, and
then raced away in a single line, advanc-
ing with the cruisers, but well clear to
port.
On each big ship the turrets were train-
ing, guns inclined to the sky at all angles
as trainers and layers tested mechanism.
Then they were still.
Warships at manoeuvres change forma-
tion like a squad at drill. To bring all
forrard turrets to bear the Admiral
altered position to line-abreast, and the
five ships swept onward dressed by the
right, white waves of foam opening at
their bows. High above their hulls each
ship shook out its b'attle ensign from the
truck.
The enemy force was clearly visible
now, across a sea as flat as a river. An
instant later Exeter broke into flame, and
soon she was surrounded by tawny cordite
smoke. Ten seconds, and a picket-fence
of white spouts stood suddenly on the
sea among the group of transports. Each
ship was firing independently at selected
targets, and with the second salvo
the red bursts of hits showed briefly
among the splashes. ’
_
Exeter Hit
Perth was outranged, and had not yet
opened fire. The range was closing
rapidly, however, and the enemy line was
returning the fire. Little stabs of yellow
rippled along the cruisers’ sides, and the
sea ahead was erupting into pillars of
white. Then, five minutes after the action
opened, a salvo came down on Exeter
and her boiler-room was hit. A broken
steam-line slowed her down to five knots ;
there was other heavy damage, and with
two destroyers in company she fell astern
out of the fight.
"Hie loss of her six 8-inch gtms was
serious ; and another squadron of cruisers
and destroyers was sighted to the north-
east.
The action was developing in intensity.
The Allied line, all forrard guns firing,
would sweep in, alter course 90 degrees,
fire full broadsides at the packed enemy
on the turn and sail out to extreme range
with after-turrets engaging, then repeat
the manoeuvre.
Above the enemy concentration steep
mushrooms of smoke, some of it oily
black and some an ordinary bonfire-grey,
stretched languidly into a clear blue sky.
Our destroyers were still hovering in
station, hoping for a chance, but at this
distance hopelessly outranged,
Then, without warning, the Dutch
destroyer Kortenaer erupted into a climb-
ing pillar of black smoke. The boiling
column rose hundreds of feet, spread out
and dropped burning oil back into the
sea. A torpedo had fired her magazine
and broken her in two.
It was now nearly five o’clock. The
flagship draped herself with flags, the
entire cruiser line turned and the
destroyer pack raced across their sterns.
The whole Allied line retired. Perth
needed the spell. Her guns were black-
ened, the paint blistered like tennis-balls ;
although in the immediate presence of
the enemy breeches were left open to
allow a cooling draught down the sizzling
barrels.
Hundreds of empty cordite cases were
cleared from turret rear-doors and fresh
boxes broken open in magazines. A
6-inch cruiser in rapid broadsides can
rid herself of 80 rounds per minute.
Fannies of tea were hurried to guns’
and magazines’ crews, and those who
could be spared dropped from their

ABORIGINALITIES
“Flip”: When Harry Barr told me that
he had certainties for the first three at
Bogolah’s picnic races and asked “What
about it?” I suggested that we go by the
morning train. “Train nothin’,” said
Harry. “I’ll bring me car round for y’;
we’ll see a bit of the countryside that way,
and I reckon it’s safer by road.” He
arrived early on Saturday morning, and
as I clambered in Harry gave me the drill
for getting her in motion. I threw my
weight fore and aft in unison with him
and tugged, whenever the engine coughed,
at a mysterious wire poking in through
the dashboard. Finally she roared, and
we chugged away with the speedo proudly
jammed at the point where an inspired
45 m.p.h. had burst its connection
20 years ago. Despite Harry’s grip on
the wheel, suggesting that if anything
went awry he would pull back with both
hands and shout “whoa!” we arrived at
the course intact, in time to leam that
all three of his “certainties” had run like
hairy goats. Harry was philosophical.
“Just like I told y’,” he said. “Safer by
road!”

“B, A. Ker”: Way back in the days
when a building job, however small, was
considered worth chasing, our local
near-builders and repairers were carrying
on a bitter feud. Based on professional
jealousy, it developed into a price-war,
with Bob Plumb winning a round from
Old Jack Thompson by beating him for
a copper job by five bob. Old Jack made
no secret of his considered opinion that
Bob was incapable of building a copper
“Another twist and We'll hang him out to dry.”
with the spiral flue essential for quick
boiling, while Bob was definite that he
was the only man in the district who
could do it. A week after the
little contract was completed a smoke-
stained and watery-eyed woman called
Old Jack in from a neighboring
job. “Can you see what’s wrong with
this copper?” she pleaded; “Mr, Plumb
built it, but it won’t draw at all.” Old
Jack licked his lips with relish. “I can
see what’s wrong, all right,” he said.
“He’s put the door where the chimney
ought to be.” The lady looked amazed.
“Is that so?” she asked. “Well,” grinned
the triumphant rival, “that’s where the
smoke’s cornin’ out.” If at that moment
a bleary-eyed, half-suffocated possum
had not flopped drunkenly over the top
of the chimney, thudded down to the
roof and staggered crazily to a sheltered
eave, Bob Plumb’s reputation as a
builder of coppers would have been
blasted for ever.

“Horseless Horseman”: Australia has
no more picturesque homestead than
Somerset —the Jardines’ old home over-
looking Albany Pass near the tip of Cape
York. Nowhere have I seen a better
site for a house, standing as it does on
a high cliff where the sou’-east trades
whisper through coconut fronds, and
bronzewings rise with a whirr and parrots
as dazzling streaks of reds and greens
flash about. The house has a glorious vista
to seaward of the blue waters of the
Barrier and its many islands. These days,
however, the old pit-sawn, cedar-walled
home is badly in need of paint, the
spacious garden ill-kept. Yet it has an
air about it, enhanced by paintings of
the Jardines, of sea-captains, and cut-
lasses hanging on the walls. It was from
this outpost the warlike abos of the Cape
York Peninsula were tamed, as were the
headhunters of Torres Strait and the
blackbirders and pirates of the Coral
Sea, For it was here that John Jardine
was sent in 1863 as resident magistrate
with a detachment of redcoats to form
a Government residency. In 1874, after
it was transferred to Thursday Island,
Somerset carried on as a cattle-station as
big as Gippsland and Jardine’s pearling-
station. Noted Governors, Admirals, ex-
plorers and naturalists have been wel-
comed there, as have survivors from the
ill-fated mail-steamer Quetta, wrecked
near by.

“Bogaduck”: If Tim O’Flaherty’s
river-bend home (B. 11/2/’4B) is on the
Murray or one of its tributaries, he
probably believes this one, too:
that the swim-bladder of a freshly-
caught Murray cod, opened to reveal
the plexus of blood-vessels lining it,
would, when held upright, bear a striking
resemblance to an old-man river redgum.
“There y’ are,” he would say. “That’s a
photo, of the tree he was born under —
every cod’s got one in his and
hardly two alike. I can often recognise
one of these gums. Be the look of this
photo. I’d say this bloke was born under'
the big tree just this side of the Tarka
landing. See this limb what ends sud-
denly? That’s the one which got broke
off when it was hit be lightning in the
big storm back in 1916.”
* * * *
“Dawgornit”: The prowess of the old-
time Yankee small-game hunter is not
exaggerated (B. 1.1/2/’4B). He used what
was then the most accurate firearm in
the world —the Kentucky rifle. The
hunter cast his bullets with the greatest
care and then made sure that they were
a good fit by swaging them through a
short length of barrel. The powder
charge was measured by filling a little tin
cup hung on the powder-horn, and the
wad was a small square of greased linen.
In tamping down the charge, three blows
of the ramrod were used on the wad and
the bullet was driven home by one tap.
My grandfather brought one back from
the U.S.A. with him, and the first time
I was allowed to use it I smashed a small
flowerpot at 50 yards; although his eye-
sight and hand were not what they were.
Grandad could group on a 4in. bull at the
same range with the old muzzle-loader.
There’s no need to doubt the stories of
Yank hunters of 100 years ago who could
hit squirrels in the head at 40 yards with
these rifles, because in the U.S.A. there
are rifle clubs which still use these long
Kentucky rifles for target-shooting; they
are bored and rifled on one of the original
machines. The scores which some
members of these muzzle-loader clubs put
up earn the respect of those who shoot
over the same ranges with the finest
modern small-bore rifles. The making
of these rifles and the accurate shooting
done with them were made the subject of
a newsreel a few years ago.
"Old Black's made a fortune since he put that sign up."
“H.A.L.”: The small-town fire-brigade
which insisted on being allowed to put
out the burning goods-truck (B. 11/2/’4B)
reminds me of my unwanted initiative
in the Army. When a fire started
in some dry grass in the camp
area a corporal ran to ring the
fire-gong, but as I had been helping to
fight fires since I was 10 I bolted for the
site of the outbreak, grabbing as I ran
a rake from a garden at the officer’s lines,
a bag doormat from the front of a hut
and two blokes as helpers. Between the
three of us we (1) raked a break in front
of the fire, (2) lit on the far side of the
break by running along with the rake
filled with burning grass, (3) beat it out
on the only place where it crossed the
break, (4) let it burn back to meet the
oncoming wall of flame, (5) beat out the
north-wing of the blaze —a track checked
it on the south-side. I later learned that
while all this was going on the fire-squad
was falling in, standing for six minutes
to await the fire-truck, boarding it and
driving to the site of the fire. When the
truck arrived they found nothing save
two acres of blackened ground, dotted
with a few bits of smouldering stuff, and
three blokes who expected a pat on the
back. Instead, the officer-in-charge of the
fire-truck gave me the first bawling-out
of my career as a soldier.

“Flight”: The tiny sunbird {Cyrtosto-
mus frenatus) is my nomination for the
builder of the most ornate nest among
all birds, native or imported. The nest,
which hangs in shrubs, from rafters, the
bough of a tree, or even a bit of wire
dangling from the roof, is made of scraps
of light bark, leaves, fibres and horse-
hair woven into a cup with a lid on it
and a porch over the entrance, it is
never attached directly—it always hangs
by a woven rope manufactured by the
birds. As well they add a tailpiece, also
beak-woven with cobweb, which hangs
and sways for nearly two feet below the
nest.

“Radian”: “Narrin” (B. 4/2/’4B) re-
calls to mind that few items of U.S. war
equipment did compare with British
standards. The Yankee automatic rifle
was a beautiful thing to handle on the
range ; but a few weeks in the jungle and
the automatic action was a write-off.
On the other hand, our short Lee-En-
fields continued to fire under shocking
conditions, slower, perhaps, but with
effective results. The same applied to.
the American Thompson sub-machine-
gun, .30-cal. Browning, .45-cal. automatic"
pistol and 75mm. field-gun as compared
with our Owen, Bren, Webley and 25-
pounder. The American .50-cal. heavy
machine-gun was certainly worth its keep,
and the recuperator system on U.S.
heavier field-guns was an improvement
on ours.

“D.R.H.”: The little hill is a forlorn
slice of what was once a great stretch of
tableland. At its foot, on the washed
clay flats, are old native camps—circles
of hearthstones and the usual clutter of
small stone-flakes of many kinds of rock,
some local, some traded down for a
hundred miles and more. Further up on
the side of the hill, among the washed-
down gibbers that once roofed the old
tableland, there are no stone hearths and
only an occasional small flake. But
among the gibbers are stone implements,
hefty choppers shaped like horseshoes,
others with the general form of a horse’s
hoof, some of them weighing halt-a-
dozen pounds, all of them massive and
strikingly different from the dainty flakes
and delicately-chipped adze stones on the
camps below. And instead of a variety of
material these tools are made only from
the quartzite and chalcedonised rock that
capped the tableland. What men were
these who lived when the land surface
was a hundred feet and more higher
than it now is? Were there giants in
those days? There certainly were strong
men, able to use the heavy hand-axes and
the great two-handed choppers. And
surely that utter desolation of stone and
sup that is a gibber tableland was a fitting
environment for them and their Age of
Stone.

“Propalong”: Years ago I was one of
the gang in a S.A. wine-cellar. We ran
pipelines, cleaned vats, washed hogsheads,
inhaled sulphur, played practical jokes
and knocked off at 5.15 p.m., feeling in-
finitely superior to the grey-haired man-
ager who, as a white-collar worker, man-
aged the complex wine-tending and
-blending programmes, unravelled the en-
tanglements Excise red-tape, bought
grapes, supervised building improvement
and maintenance, managed a sizable vine-
yard, kept the books, saw to everything
from bacteriological cleanliness to the
tidiness of the premises and knocked off
at 5 p.m. A week or two ago I went
back to the old place to find the cellar
gang still playing with pipelines and
hogsheads, a different manager still tele-
phoning, adding figures, writing memos
and testing wines all at once. But a
different spirit prevailed. The cellar gang
no longer blithely whistled as they
sprinkled flowers of sulphur on each
other’s tobacco. Instead they crawled
around like old men, avoiding one’s eyes,
monosyllabic, joyless and prematurely
old. Then I found the reason. Since the
40-hour week became compulsory the
gang knocks off at 4.30 ; the boss still
works till 5. The shock has been too
great; the old pride has departed. And
unless someone creates a special 48-hour
week for that wine-cellar it is doomed
and damned as certainly as any blue-
ribbon fancier could pray for.

were made. Shearing on the Malloy

BLACK COCKATOOS.
Where the summer world lies dreaming,
Dusty gold and dappled grey,
All day long they have been screaming,
Screaming in the scrub all day.
Till the forest stirs from languor,
Sighs and falls asleep again.
Till the heat-waves shake in anger.
Trembling down the tussock plain.
Dusky pirates, hour on hour
Plundering, circling, dawn till dark,
Round about the slanting tower
Of one ancient stringybark.
Curving beak and talon raking,
Rending at the weathered sheath —
Crests erect, and shrieking, seeking
For the great white grubs beneath.
How the echoes, rising, falling,
The unwilling ears bemuse!
All the air aches with the squalling
Of the feasting cockatoos.
Endlessly they tear and tatter.
Quarrel, clamber, twist and turn '
While the bark and falling litter
Drift into the bracken-fern.
Not until the summer sunset
Paints the distant peaks with rose
Will the raiders cease their onset,
Leave the timber cleansed of foes.
Then, as in the violet vastness
Candle stars begin to burn,
To some unknown forest fastness
The black cockatoos return.
Peace and hastening quiet cover
Night’s enchanted camping-ground,
Silence like a sea runs over
The discordances of sound.
VICTORIA.

“Mat’s Mate”: In Hamley Bridge
(S.A.) we struck a cove who wanted a
circular hole dug for an underground
tank. We took it on at 2s. a foot (15ft.
deep by 6ft. diameter). When we got
down about 18in. the cove changed his
mind about the site and Mat said, “Well,
you’ll have to pay for what we dug.”
“Fair enough,” said the cove. We were
3ft. down with the second hole when he
changed his mind back to the original
site, agreeing to pay the extra. We had
that down sft. 6in. when his wife butted
in; they argued, and he ordered us back
to the second hole. There we stayed
until Mat, who’d astonished me by a
strange silence, stopped work when it
was 9ft. 6in. deep. “If you want her
any deeper,” he told the cove, “it’ll cost
y’ another zac a foot.” The cove looked
wild. “But the contract was for 15ft.,”
he yelped. “That’s right,” Mat said, “an’
we dug 9ft. 6in. here an’ sft. 6in. over
there. That’s 15ft., ain’t it? Two bob a
foot for 15ft. was our price. You want
any more diggin’ y’ got t’ pay extra.”
He blustered, but he paid.

“Zake”: “Mulgoola! ” exploded the
ex-shearers’ cook. “Don’t talk to me o’
that station —they were the fussiest mob
I ever met in the back-country. Once
someone left the lid off the beef-cask an’
when I goes to get a junk there’s an inch
o’ maggots on it. I takes the beef
down and souses it in the creek, scrapes
all the crawlers out o’ the cask and
dumps it back again. The cows went real
snaky about the state o’ the beef.” “Well,
what else did you expect?” someone put
in. “Would you like to eat maggotty
beef?” “Oh, it wasn’t that they went
crook about,” went on the ex-babbler,
“It was the horse-leeches that got on
to it!”
♦ * * *
“Bo”: The Pilliga Scrub mightn’t have
much to push it famewards, but it can at-
least boast that it has, living on its
fringes, the hardest man in the State. With
a hint of respect they quote the time when
to old Clissold’s place one hot morning
came an unusual sort of swagman who
walked down the long drive from the
road gate, skirted the house, sighted the
woodheap, walked smartly to it, peeled
off his coat, grabbed the axe and, com-
pletely ignoring Clissold, who was sitting
outside the harness-shed mending a col-
lar, hopped into the big stack of wood.
For two hours Clissold was aware of the
stranger’s enthusiastic toil, viewing, as he
glanced up every now and then, that the
heap of cut wood crept ever higher. A
gloomy, silent man, he left the new-
comer to his chosen form of recreation.
Then the dinner-bell rang from the house,
and simultaneously Clissold put down his
needle and thread and the stranger
dropped the Kelly and straightened up.
They both converged on the back door,
outside which they met. “G’day, boss,”
quoth the unusual one. “I believe in
earnin’ me tucker before I get it —an’ I
think that’s earned me a decent feed.
Now if” But Clissold’s rasping voice
cut in as his dead-fish eye wandered to
the woodheap. “It’ll corst me a good file
and a lot o’ time putting that axe in order
after the way you handled it—it’ll prob-
ably be gapped, too. I oughter sock y’
five bob, but I’ll be generous and let y’
orf fer half a dollar”—and he held out
his hand!

was out of sight Mrs. McGinty yoked £
up the sulky, untreed, washed and ironed
the kids and put them in it, apologised to
the dog, attired herself for visiting and
drove off. The dog watched them go,
gave a couple of wistful yelps, then
trotted up into the scrub, where it in-
spected McGinty, sat beside his uncon-
scious body for a time, growled warn-
ingly at a hovering sparrow-hawk and then
settled down to sleep. Little black ants
prospected McGinty while the sun
westered, then McGinty stirred, sat up
and looked blearily around. He addressed
the dog. “So she’s cleared out again, eh?
And what did you do? You let her go,
you useless mongrel. Didn’t have the
gumption to chase the neddy up the
paddock where she couldn’t catch it, did
you?” The dog wagged its tail and
grinned foolishly, McGinty arose and
wavered to his home, the dog ambling
behind. On the table was a note: “Clean
shirt on bed. Pompey [saddle-horse] in
stable. _Ydu remember we promised to
go to Dora s this afternoon. See you

Mctjinty rode away, and I, who’d been

ot months and had witnessed all this,
ent disgustedly up the paddock, denied
any drama or comedy in the ending.

it ' Vaniks, C. Bene’ (B.
11/2/ 48). Matter o fact I was heading
for the South Coast, but fell for the
blarney of a couple of specialists who
*-° unrave l t° me the puzzle
or identifying the different waders—•
those indiscriminate grey fowl which
scurry about where the tide ebbs and
nows. So we headed for a smelly in-
dustnal estuary, and, sure enough, they
were there in thousands, rushing up and
down as though helping the tide out,
jabbing, poking, probing, scurrying—
anything but singing; and under a
barrage of technical advice I was soon
boxed amongst curlew sandpipers and
sandpaper curlews, golden plovers and
leaden lubbers, little stints and big stints,
dotterels, cockerels, mackerels, bar-tailed
god wits and shrivel-headed nitwits, and
I sat down for a smoke. Then the
poultry started to sort itself out; on the
:nd of a little sandspit were a group
decidedly smaller than any others, and
they were little stints. Next size up were
sandpipers, named from peculiarities at
their extremities—the curlew ’piper from
the curve of his beak, which slightly
resembles that of the sea-curlew, and
the sharp-tailed sandpiper, which is easily
recognised by that; and here you may
pause to offer thanks that ornithologists
are not responsible for the naming of
people. Golden plovers are next, and of
all the migrants from the breeding-
grounds on the Arctic tundras these are
the shrewdest—they strive to introduce
a touch of red into the plumage before
tackling the flight across Siberia. Bigger
still are the godwits. Long-legged, but
correspondingly long-beaked, their bodies
are about horizontal as they poke at the
mu d—the bar-tailed fellow, that is ; the
black-tailed has longer legs without the
extra reach forrard, so he nearly stands
on his head when feeding, and his dusky
rudder points to the sky. You can pick
him by that; if he had sense enough to
spread his legs like a giraffe you could
tell him by the way he spread his legs,
but he hasn’t, so you can’t. An interest-
ing group, “C. 8.,” but they lack the finer
powers of expression. Their formation-
flying has moments of exhilaration, but
it’s a poor substitute for a morning
chorus in a ferny gully.

“Sevener”; Nice drawing of Scor-
field’s (B. 18/2/’4B) showing the

“Jumrunner”: So “Bo” nominates
quartpot-boiling competitions as the acme
of excitement in the old days (B.
18/2/’4B). Pah! —a trivial pastime full of
boredom to one used to watching egg-
laying contests. I’ve seen the time when
the whole district knocked off work for
a fortnight as the time-limit drew near,
and gathered round the pens offering and
taking odds right and left and literally
screaming with excitement as first Blogg’s
Leghorn took the lead and then Brown’s
Orpington drew level while Smith’s Ply-
mouth Rock tried to push through on
the rails. Imagine the excitement when,
with the contest apparently over and the
winner carried shoulder-high to the
nearest bar, another egg was found in
the runner-up’s straw, a dead-heat was
declared and the third owner put in pro-
test alleging that the first dead-heater’s
age-teeth were false. Them was the days
of real sport.
* * * *
“The 0.D.”; All this talk about per-
sonal odors identifying a man to his dog
notwithstanding (B. 18/2/’4B), the aver-
age bush-dog invariably regards his man
as a stranger if he appears in strange
attire. If you want to prove it, put on
the wife’s skirt and hat and walk up to
your dog. Incidentally, a one-man horse
reacts in the same way to violent changes
in his man’s clothes.

“Hanko”: The native blackfish can
share pools with eels, but introduced
English perch (red-fins) are gradually
ousting 'them from Victorian streams.
Blackies are sluggards with no fight in
them and are despised of sporting rod-
men. Hook one, and it comes to surface
like a waterlogged boat; it is slimy,
scaleless and chockful of tiny bones;
but it is the sweetest-eating and most
delicately-flavored fish that ever hit
a pan. Blackfish lurk in brush-shaded
backwaters of south-flowing streams, and
they don’t thrive north of the dividing
range. That being so, the Victorian Gov-
ernment aims to breed them at Snob’s
Creek hatchery in the north-east of the
State.
“Horseless Horseman”: The last
stronghold I know of Victoria’s vanishing
blackfish are the creeks on Wilson’s
Promontory, and in particular the stream
trickling into Sealers’ Cove on the east
coast there. For decades now the
presence of trout in many Gippsland
rivers and the silting-up of others through
the clearing of timber and the disappear-
ance of logs—the favored haunt of the
blackie—seem to have largely killed out
this fine eating fish, which is the only
freshwater fish indigenous to Victorian
streams south of the Divide. A mile or
so upstream along the creek at Sealers’
Cove we used, in pre-war days, to hook
dozens of blackfish in the deep, shady,
log-filled pools among the lillipilli, A
cobber camped there recently bagged up
to a dozen and a half a day, among them
a few three-pounders.
OLD EVELEIGH.
The locos out at Eveleigh
Are mighty ones indeed,
Their shining wheels spin heavily,
Their whistles as they speed
Awaken echoes slumbering
With their discordant screams—•
The echoes that are numbering
Old engines in their dreams.
Old C’s and D’s and L’s and N’s
And mountain engines, too —
That mascot of the enginemen’s
The big J pulled them through.
Long-barrelled rigs for level lands,
Like lanky ghosts they fled —
Small wheels to climb the tablelands,
That’s what the drivers said.
Their ghosts still haunt Old Eveleigh,
Broadmeadow and the Creek;
And where the night lies heavily,
The flying engines seek
Grey shapes along the distances
ti Which they can ne’er o’ertake—
“On-on! On-on!” each piston says,
“Ere morning lights can break.”
They are the kings of other days,
Those shapes that race ahead —
The fliers of the mother-days
From which our times were bred.
New monsters out of Eveleigh
May rush from dark to day
Yet, steam they ne’er so cleverly,
The ghosts still lead the way.

Amongst the many remarkable machine tools in

machining of engine flywheels. It turns out a true
and well-balanced wheel.
This equipment is typical of the efficiency employed
in producing Ronaldson-Tippett Engines. It indicates
the outlook of this company on production and is
one of the reasons why Ronaldson-Tippett Engines

THE WAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY, I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
The Worm Threat.
“Bungaree”: It was here fore-
cast that the abnormal summer
rains would make ideal breeding
conditions for worms in sheep.
The worms have come, worse
luck, and many sheepmen have
either been caught short or
don’t yet realise the danger. In
“wormy” districts, where sheep
are drenched fairly regularly,
the position is well in hand, as
sheepmen there have learned ,to
recognise symptoms of infesta-
tion and deal with it. In so-
called “safe” areas it’s different,
the symptoms being strange and
a number of men refusing to ad-
mit to themselves that worms
have arrived.
Explanation of the sudden in-
crease of internal parasites under
wet summer conditions is simple
when the life-cycle of the various
worms is known. Worms do not
increase inside the sheep. The
sheep is infected by eating grass
on which a young worm larva
has been waiting. Once .inside
the sheep it commences to grow,
and within three weeks is fully
grown and begins breeding. The
rate at which worms lay eggs
is astronomical. A single
female Barber’s Pole worm lays
5000 eggs per day. The output
of eggs from a sheep carrying
several hundred of these worms
may be imagined. The eggs
pass through the sheep in the
droppings, and their fate de-
pends on whether the ground on
which they fall is wet or dry. If
it is dry and dusty and the pas-
ture has no moisture in it the
chances are that practically all
the eggs will die. On the other
hand, any semblance of mois-
ture or dew will allow the eggs
to hatch out and the larvae will
then crawl on to grass to wait
up to 12 months for sheep to
pick them up.
It follows, then, that warm,
showery weather will bring
about almost 100 p.c. hatching
out of eggs. In a wet summer
the grass grows rank, and be-
cause of that and the fear of
grass seed, sheep prefer to graze
on those patches they have eaten
down fairly closely. The result
is that these short - cropped
patches are being grazed inten-
sively and the danger of picking
up worm larvae is multiplied
several hundred times.
Drenching may be done either
to prevent or cure. Prevention
is the aim of all good sheepmen,
because when sheep become
really wormy the damage done
to condition, to their wool and
to their constitution generally
cannot be repaired. Further,
most drenches are effective
against adult worms only, so
that the sheep may die from a
heavy infestation of immature
worms which are practically im-
mune to drenches.
Drenching alone will not save
sheep if they are put back into
a paddock that is heavily in-
fested with worms. They should
be put into an area that has
been spelled for several months.
At present, when there are stacks
of feed everywhere, it is far
better to carry four times nor-
mal stocking in one particular
paddock and to spell the other
three so that as sheep are
drenched at regular intervals
they are immediately put into a
fresh paddock. The length of
time they should remain there
depends largely on the rainfall.
They may have to be drenched
and shifted once a month while
the threat of heavy worm-infes-
tation is on. Spelling a paddock
for three months just now will
not kill all the worms that have
hatched out, but it will reduce
them considerably, and sheep
will not pick up a fresh infesta-
tion nearly so fast as on soiled,
pastures.
Chilled-Beef Trade.
“Agric”: P, B. Newcomen, of
the Australian Meat Board, and
president of the Primary Pro-
ducers’ Council of Australia,
who attended the Geneva trade
talks as an adviser on the land
industries, made certain investi-
gations in London for the Meat
Board.
The British liked our pig-
meats (“the best pigmeat im-
ported,” said some) and the im-
provement in the quality of
Australian lamb, the latter the
result of rigid enforcement of
grading standards, although con-
siderable wastage occurred as
the result of telescoping car-
cases, but some exception was
taken to the quality of our/ewe
mutton. Australian beef, which
Newcomen inspected on arrival
in England, did not suffer in
comparison with imports of
frozen Argentine beef, some
quarters packed by Brisbane
abattoir being particularly
attractive on arrival.
The beef battle between Aus-
tralia and Argentina will be in-
tensified when the chilled-beef
trade is again resumed, and
Newcomen expects the Argen-
tine to press for this at the
earliest favorable opportunity.
There is not, however, any pos-
sibility of the chilled-beef trade
being resumed as long as meat
rationing continues in England.
Shipping companies, says
Newcomen, are somewhat re-
luctant to incur expense on the
provision of additional facilities
for the transport and handling
of chilled beef, which, at pre-
sent, might be of a speculative
nature in view of the fact that,
unlike the Argentine, Australia
cannot guarantee all-the-year-
round supplies. In an effort to
improve the position, New-
comen suggests the closest co-
“Feed ’em, and don't go playin' favorites."
operation between the C.S.I.R.
and the Department of C. and
I.R. in England in an intensifi-
cation of research in chilling
technique, particularly in regard
to holding during the long voy-
age. He considers there is a
definite place in the British
market for our chilled beef, but
at the Australian end a lot more
than talk is necessary; the
British won’t buy our beef just
because we happen to be an
Empire country.
Bossing the Bull.
“Bogaduak”: The owner of
a Jersey bull, after being tossed
and gored, spent a few weeks in
hospital and came back swear-
ing that he’d put up a fence to
beat the brute. It was 6ft.
high, with posts 12ft. apart
and 24 strands of the heaviest
barbed-wire procurable. The
bull was out within a week.
Came a traveller with an elec-
tric-fence charger and offered to
give a free demonstration; he
put up two plain No. 12 wires
on thin metal stakes with insu-
lators attached, connected up
the charger and invited the
owner to turn the bull loose
inside.
The Jersey looked around,
shook his head and ambled for-
ward ; a few seconds later we
saw the nearest thing to a bull
turning a back-somersault ive
ever witnessed. Looking very
dazed, he got up, trotted to
another part of the fence and
had a second helping of volts.
That bull stayed thereafter in-
side the electric fence and not
the most glamorous young heifer
could ’make him come within a
yard of the wire which carried
such a kick.
Water for Stock.
“Mr.”: The ideal is to pipe
the water from a storage from
which stock are excluded to
troughs in all the paddocks,
yards and pens. The “Victorian
Journal of Agriculture” gives
water-consumption figures for
the general run of farm animals.
A dairy cow will drink 15 gal-
lons a day on the average, a
horse 10 gallons, a beef animal
the same, sheep and pigs i\
gallons, poultry six gallons per
100 birds. Variations will oc-
cur one way or the other, ac-
cording to, temperature,
humidity, type of food eaten,
size of animal and purpose for
which it is kept. >
For example, a milking cow
may drink anything from five to
40 gallons a day. If water isn’t
there when she wants it, or if
she has to travel long distances
in the heat for it, there’ll be an
immediate reflection in her
yield. Having a body more than
half water, with blood and other
fluids 90 p.c. and milk 87£ p.c.
water, this is understandable.
In times of drought, feed stock
close to water to cut down on
the expenditure of energy needed
to travel between food and
fluid. Allow as much water as
the stock will drink, but see that
working horses take their liquid
before their feed. Body .tempera-
ture is kept somewhere between
98° and 104° Fahr., according
to species, by evaporation of
water from the lungs and pores'.
High Cost of Lime.
“Pat Ater”: Lime, a primary
need of pastures on the N.S.W.
North Coast and elsewhere, is
too dear for most small dairy-
men. A dressing of a ton to
the acre costs up to £4 10s.
landed on the farm, and many
farms need two tons to the acre,
not once, but every year. That
means £9 an acre a year for lime
only, and it is more than some
of the low-lying and not-too-
fertile areas are worth.
Even “the big men” on rich
flats, as out of Lismore and
Casino, are finding it beyond
them, and they mostly compro-
mise with dressings of lOcwt. an
acre. This, given annually, will
often keep the cattle in decent
condition. Much more is
wanted to correct calcium-
deficiency and restore soil bal-
ance.
One battler near Murwillum-
bah admits to being beaten.
Calcium-deficiency is obvious;
his herd is listless and poor.
With family help he barely
makes tucker. The dairy in-
spector told him that two
tons of lime an acre was needed.
Asking the cost he said, “Why,
my land isn’t worth that! What
can I do?” “Get out and give
someone else the headache,” he
was advised.
The increased price of butter
does not pay these men. They
will be always dairying, in the
nature of things, but the Gov-
ernment refused them a subsidy
of 10s. a ton on lime.
A lime deposit out of Kemp-
sey is being worked on co-
operative lines by a group of
butter factories. They are

article at little over cost. But
even that is beyond many dairy-
men. The benefits of lime-
dressing in any area with over
30in. rainfall are there to see.
Even in cooler upland districts
it’s almost as spectacular as
super, and other chemical or
manure applications.
The Percheron.
“Poilu”: Those comments on
the Percheron (B. 24/12/’47), if
made among any gathering of
farmers in the lower north of
S.A., or in almost any of the
agricultural areas of that State,
would earn their author such an
ear-bashing as would silence him
for years. Established about the
end of 1913, the Percheron has
made steady progress ever since,
proving over and over again his
ability to reproduce under Aus-
tralia’s varying conditions every
one of the remarkable character-
istics for which he is noted else-
where.
In the Percheron districts of
S.A. they can give samples of
(a) strength, a gelding that
pulled a trolley loaded
with 100 bags of wheat; ( b ) ac-
tivity, horses weighing (by
scales and not by guess) a ton
and over, that can walk from
four to five miles an hour, or
stallions that have, when neces-
sity required, walked 50 miles
in the day; (c) docility, of little
kiddies riding aged stallions;
(d) toughness, of teams that
have worked all their lives with-
out requiring to be shod.
“Rooster’s” information about
English conditions appears to
need brushing up.' Prices rea-
lised at the annual Percheron
sales held at Histon leave no
doubt of the breed’s popularity
in England, while at the world-
famous Millshills Stud in Perth-
shire a complete changeover
was made some 15 years ago
from Clydesdales to Percherons,
the sort of thing the Scot doesn’t
do for fun.
From S.A. the Percheron has
spread to every State in Aus-
traha and to New Zealand, and
were it not for the incessant
“pressure” sales - talk pushing
mechanised farming there is
little doubt that by now he
would have dominated the horse
world here as he has done for a
long time in U.S.A.
Cutting Corrugated-Iron.
“Bert the Carpenter”: Don’t
fool around with wires, old
saws, spades, etc. (B. 11/2/’4B).
Spend a few bob on a plumber’s
hacking-knife. If cutting down
a flute, run a pencil-line along,
place the sheet on level sand, or
soft earth, place the knife on one
end of the line, tap the back of
it with a hammer and run a
clean, straight cut without
ragged edges from one end of
the sheet to the other. If cut-
ting across the flutes run the
line for the cut, then start at one
end and tap the knife only on
the rising sides of the flute.
When you reach the other side
of the sheet turn around and go
back, this time on the opposite
sides of the flutes. To straighten
out the slight buckling of the
edge which results lay a few
sheets of iron above each other,
put the cut one on top arid tap
the buckled edges smooth with
a bit of wood.
Always grip the hacking
knife by the rivetted leather
handle to avoid jarring the
fingers, and remember that the
whole secret of a clean cut is a
series of little taps so the point
only of the knife does the cut-
ing, rather than heavy blowsl
which make six-inch gashes in
which the knifeblade jams.
Pulley Sizes.
“Radian”; In pulley calcula-
tions three figures are usually
known. These are speed and
diameter of one and speed or
diameter of the other. Rule is
to multiply together speed and
diameter of the known pulley
and divide by speed, or diameter,
of the unknown.
Example: An engine having a
crankshaft speed of 1000 r.p.m.
and a pulley of 6in, diameter is
required to drive a pump at 600
r.p.m. What size pulley is re-
quired for pump? Well,
1000 x 6 divided by 600 = 10.
Therefore a lOin.-diameter pul-
ley is required.
Another example: An engine
having a speed of 500 r.p.m. and
pulley of 6in. diameter drives
a shaft by means of a pulley
15in. in diameter. What is
speed of driven shaft?
500 x 6 divided by 15 = 200,
which would be the r.p.m. of the
driven shaft.
Hints for the Farm.
‘Sundowner”; Young pigs in
pens with concrete floors should
have access to soil which con-
tains iron, otherwise they may
develop anaemia, indicated by
slow growth and unthriftiness.
T oung pigs consume some soil
by nosing or by sucking from
the muddy udder of their mother.
If they’re housed on hard floors
place a few handfuls of earth
on the floor each day,
“Myrr”: For cabbage-moth
and cabbage-butterfly, apply a
50 p.c. lead-arsenate powder
from a tin-shaker or gauze-bag
every 10 days or so. If a spray
is preferred, mix 4oz. of lead-
arsenate paste or 2oz. of the
powder in four gallons of water.
The same treatment does for the
tomato-moth.
Before building a
stack of hay in the open, place
several lengths of fencing-wire
at ground-level and about 6ft.
apart, with about 4ft. of wire
projecting on each side. When
the stack is complete, pass a wire
over the cover, and fasten to
each projecting end. As the
stack shrinks, take up the slack
with a strainer and make fast.
No wind can shift a covering
if this method is used.
“Homo”: Whether it is
trimmed into a hedge or allowed
to grow for a shelter-belt, it is
hard, to beat the lucerne-tree as
far as use is concerned. Its
leaves are good fodder and the
blossoms provide nectar for bees.
It is easy to grow and is drought-
resistant. It should not be
planted too close to fences, as
stock are partial to it. Birds
are encouraged about the garden
by the presence of lucerne-trees.
“0.5. G.”; My neighbor now
swears that his implement is go-
ing to be placed well under
coyer when ploughing is
finished. The other day a bag
he had thrown over the wood-
work was ignited by heat re-
flected from the polished surface
of one of the discs. Only quid
action saved a nearby shed fron
going up in flames.
“W.* Court”; Bookworms can
very soon perforate and ruin ex-
pensive books. Shake infested
books and put them out in the
open air. Formaldehyde fumes
are very effective; rub any
cracks in the bookshelves with a
formalin-soaked rag. Tie a
scrap of the rag to a length of
string and drag it slowly through
the backs of infested books,
gun-cleaner fashion. The vapor
will suffocate the worms in the
bindings. Or rub the bindings
with formalin before re-arrang-
ing the books on the shelves.
“Will C.”: Before melting
glue, rub over the inside of the
glue-pot with light mineral oil
or vaseline. This will prevent
the glue from sticking thickly to
the sides of the vessel and will
make it easier to handle.

EVENINGS AT BILL’S PLACE
By LES ROBINSON
BILL, who was a widower,
and his son got on fairly
well together, especially
in the daytime, because,
whenever Bill was peevish, Alf,
as; much as possible, kept out
of his way. They shared the
work of the farmlet, Alf doing
any that was at all hard. Bill,
who was old, just pottered
about. .
Alf was easy-going and even-
tempered, Bill was aggressive
and at times domineering. He
wanted everything done his way.
Alf, who was thorough, pre-
ferred to do things by methods
that experience had taught him
were satisfactory. He was quiet.
“Too quiet altogether,” Bill
would mumble. Quietness, in
his opinion, was tedious and an
affliction.
Bill was noisy. In order, for
instance, to get rid of the
phlegm, real or imaginary, that
seemed to gather in his throat
during the night, he made a kind
of hullabaloo first thing in the
morning which sounded like
bellowing. It could be heard
and startled birds hundreds of
yards away.
They were opposites in almost
every way. Although Alf had
long been grown up, Bill kept
on treating him as though he
was still a boy—a boy who,
to use Bill’s own words, was
“wrong-headed” and in need of
supervision, guidance and cor-
rection, especially correction.
So Alf had, with resignation,
to put up with a great deal. As
Bill was often querulous, Alf,
for the sake of peace and quiet-
ness, humored him, which
wasn’t always easy.
BILL’S ideas were old-
fashioned. They had been
bequeathed to him by his for-
bears and were ineradicable.
Yet, curiously enough, although
he had a rooted dislike for what
he termed “These noofangled
notions,” he thought that it was
Alf who was behind the times,
but never, by any chance, him-
self. He was most contrary, as
a matter of fact, and unpre-
dictable too.
If he had been at all consist-
ent he would have continued to
use candles and kerosene lamps
merely because he had always
used them instead of having
electric light installed when it
was brought within reach of
their abode,
He grumbled enough about
having to pay for it, and Alt
suspected that he derived a great
deal of satisfaction whenever,
because of a strike at the power-
house or for some other reason,
the light was cut off, from
messing about again with the
kerosene lamps,
Nor, if at all consistent,
would he have had a wireless
set - He’d have maintained that
the phonograph (an heirloom),
erratic and strident, he once
possessed was good enough for
him. The wireless had to be
more powerful, too, than any-
body else round about rented or
owned.
A smaller set capable only of
a volume of sound that most
people who live in cottages the
size of, or even larger than,
Bill’s are prone to regard as be-
ing ample would not have suited
him in the least,
He was fond of imposing a
strain upon the credulity of the
neighbors by telling them just
how far away, in the stillness
of the countryside, it could be
heard and by mentioning the
stations he could get, which, as
their sets were less powerful,
they could not. He wouldn’t
let Alf or anybody else touch
it.
Sometimes, on days that were
wet especially, he’d switch it on
early in the morning and keep
it functioning without cessation
until late at rfight. He’d listen
with avidity to talks by experts
on how to make a living by
tilling the soil, but, as his
memory was defective and he
was not in the habit of taking
notes, the benefit he derived
from the information they im-
parted was negligible.
The little he did remember
was more often a hindrance
rather than a help. Alf would
be doing something perhaps in
the way that he and Bill and
Bill’s father and grandfather too
probably had always done it,
because they had found that it
suited their requirements at a
minimum of expense, when Bill
would pop round a corner and
proceed to tell him exactly how,
according to an “expert”—some
backwoodsman from Redfern
or Marrickville probably, as Alf
said —that particular job should
be dope.
Now and then Bill would fall
asleep and snore on the sofa
through broadcasts that lasted
for hours. After tea he and Alf
would play cards occasionally,
but more often they just sat
and argued about this, that and
the other.
THEY wrangled more about
music perhaps than they did
about anything else.
Bill liked sea-chanties, bassos
and brass bands. He did not
mind how robustious they were.
The more so the better from his
point of view.
He had a partiality as well for
the songs, sentimental most of
them, he had known all his life,
such as, just to mention a few,
“Annie Laurie,” “Killarney,”
“The Old Folks at Home,”
“Juanita,” “Come Back to
Erin,” “Thora,” “Come into the
Garden, Maud,” “In the Gloam-
ing,” “Silver Threads Among
the Gold” and “Two Little Girls
in Blue.” And, as his voice
was arid and penetrating like
that of a cicada, he irritated
Alf by joining in whenever they
were being sung.
He also enjoyed community-
singing immensely, never, ex-
cept when asleep or elsewhere,
missing a session devoted to it,
and participating with such
gusto that he was often hoarse
for a long while afterwards.
Alf was a devotee of “Swing,”
and addicted to playing the
mouth-organ.
“Why don’t y’ take up some
’igh-class instrument like the
piano-accordion or the banjo?”
Bill would growl. “Upon me
soul y’ don’t seem ter ’ave no
more ambition than an abo!”
They’d commence to argue
then.
“You’re the most pigheaded
and obstinate feller I’ve ever
met in me life!” Bill, when the
argument became heated, which
happened with frequency, would
exclaim.
He was as obstinate as a
wombat himself and everybody
for miles round knew it, but, as
he was also very touchy, and
likely, if offended, to sulk for
a day or two, Alf refrained from
telling him so,
Alf’s forbearance, considering
the provocation he received,
wa>, though Bill would have
denied it, thus starting yet
another argument, praiseworthy.
About 10 o’clock Bill would
begin yawning. He’d scrape his
pipe out, put it on the mantel-
piece, wind the clock, and, de-
spite the fact that the wireless,
having been overwhelmed,
without intermission, the whole
evening by disputation, had
merely filled their ears with a
jumble of sound, he’d say:
“Well, the programme was
better tonight than what they’ve
been givin’ us lately.”
Alf, sleepy now, and dis-
inclined for further argument,
would agree, say something non-
committal, or refrain from com-
ment altogether.

A Heinous Crime.
“A former Army captain with
years’ war service, who runs a one-
man furniture-repair factory in Syd-
ney, was fined for repairing on a
Saturday afternoon at his factory a
tray belonging to his sister,”
Giving evidence at the
Children’s Court in what he
described as one of the most
flagrant cases in his experience,
Senior Inspector Snuper, of the
Department of Private-Enter-
prise Strangulation, said that
late on the previous Saturday
afternoon he was returning to
his home in the departmental
car after having been playing
bowls when he distinctly heard
sounds of hammering, suggestive
of industrial activity.
Since introduction of the Gov-
ernment regulation which for-
bade any private citizen from
doing any odd jobs himself
around his own dwelling, he and
the other 170 inspectors in the
department had had to work as
much as four hours a day in an
endeavor to stamp out this
reprehensible practice. Think-
ing, therefore, that some house-
holder near by was daring to
flout the regulations by perhaps
adjusting his lawnmower, or
even of repairing his fence,
which because of the possibility
of jeopardising employment
among members of the Build-
ing Workers’ Industrial Union
was now an indictable otfence,
he had got out of the car and
started to trace the sound.
He was convinced it was com-
ing from a house named
“Emoh Ruo.” However, a man
who looked to him like the type
one would suppose would name
his house “Emoh Ruo” was sit-
ting on the front verandah
listening to the radio descrip-
tion of the races.
Although he, the inspector,
was aware that in itself there
was nothing suspicious in this
—indeed, it was a recreation
which the Government encour-
aged citizens to follow—he im-
mediately formed the opinion
that this was a blind to cover
up nefarious activity at the rear
of the premises.
Since the inception of the 24-
hour week, he explained, there
had naturally been a big in-
crease in the leisure -avail-
able to male workers. The
Government had done its best
to absorb this by the introduc-
tion of five-afternoons-a-week
dog- and horse-racing and night
trots every night including Sun-
days. As housewives were not
considered workers under the
meaning of the regulations when
first promulgated many un-
scrupulous householders had in
their leisure time done the shop-
ping and got their wives to do
odd jobs around the house. The
regulations had therefore been
tightened forbidding either wives
or children to do such work.
It had been a matter of vital
principle with the Government.
Whilst it had no objection to
women working an 80-hour week
in the home—housewives had
no trade-union and did not sub-
scribe to party funds—their
doing work 1 around their own
home other than the various
tasks as specifically set out
in the regulations had been
banned because it might deprive
a bona fide unionist and
especially a member of a mili-
tant trade-union—of work. That
a shortage of labor due to the
introduction of the 24-hour
working week made it impos-
sible to get household odd-jobs
done by recognised union labor
was quite beside the point. For
the same reason the performing
of odd jobs by any child ini the
family over the age of 18 months
was also prohibited.
He, the inspector, had there-
fore in this case immediately
suspected that the verandah-
sitter’s wife was out the back
illegally and surreptitiously
mending some article.
The sounds of industrial ac-
tivity were coming from a
cubby-house in the corner of the
yard. Stealthily approaching, he
looked in. There was the ac-
cused, now standing in the dock,
holding a toy hammer. Beside
him was his dinkie, a half-driven-
in tack, mute but unmistakable
evidence of the offence.
But there had been something
even worse. Standing beside de-
fendant was his girl playmate
from next door holding her
doll’s pram. Questioned closely,
she had admitted that defendant
had tried to drive in a small nail
with his toy hammer in an en-
deavor to keep the handle on.
She also admitted under ex-
amination that she had given de-
fendant an all-day sucker and a
chocolate frog. This obviously
constituted payment for work
done in defiance of the regula-
tions. The girl would later be
charged with having been an
accessory before and after the
fact. He would ask for the utmost
rigor of the law in this case.
The magistrate, in imposing
sentence on the parents and
ordering that the accused be de-
prived of attending either night-
trots or dog-meetings for a
month, said it was quite wrong,
in view of the regulations, that
parents should allow their
children to grow up with the
idea that they were living in a
free country.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND

Social Security
It was back in the bad days that I
first gave thought to social security. Then
in my early ’teens I got a job, joined
a lodge, took out hospital units and began
putting a few bob away for a rainy day.
As I qualified for higher wages I saved
still more and made further provision
for the future with life assurance.
During the depression I scraped, carried
the swag and toiled at any job I could
find and managed to keep my head
above water and my assurance and lodge
dues paid without drawing the dole. With
better times I further improved my
“social-security” fund and was just feel-
ing proud of my accomplishments when
I heard of Mr. Chifley,
I helped to vote him in, and as a fitting
reward he promised me something I
already had —social security. Free, he said
it was, but my income-tax assessments
show'it to be far more costly than the
scheme I worked out for myself.
At first I could see some good in social-
services legislation. If it were to help
the sick, aged and infirm or the dinkum
toiler who had struck a bad patch, then
I didn’t mind weighing in. But it goes
further than that and lends itself to ex-
ploitation and future repercussions.
There are the younger men coming on.
Will they work as their fathers and
grandfathers did if the Government is
prepared to spoonfeed them? Some of
the more independent will, but many will
go on agitating for shorter hours and
higher pay—or social-services unemploy-
ment-benefits.
There’s the fellow, too, who boozed
and gambled while I worked and saved.
If the worst comes to the worst, the Gov-
ernment will look after him at the tax-
payers’ expense. In the past he had to
do a bit of work to exist; in the future
he should have no worries.
And then there’s the man who hung
on to his beloved “susso” until forced to
do a bit of useful work. He can see a
Golden Age in the offing; something
better than susso ever was. Already he
is longing for the day when work will
get a bit tighter and he can lose his job
without losing face and qualify for un-
employment benefits.
Only by giving a fair day’s work for
a fair day’s pay will we attain social,
and national, security. Nobody blessed
with health and strength should take out
of the bag without putting in, but under
the present system the thrifty toiler must
contribute not only for the needy but
for the waster and the exploiter.
I still believe that man’s best helping
hand is the one on his own arm. I still
save for my future, despite the Govern-
ment’s “free” social services, but I find
that the pound I earmark today is not
worth half of what it was back in the
bad old days. When it regains its pur-
chasing power—and we can help it by
all pulling our weight—l’ll begin to think
that we are on the road to social security
and the Golden Age.—L. P. (Vic.).
Socialism
The ordinary wage-earner neither
understands nor wants socialism. He has
much the same ambitions as the so-called
capitalist. He wants more money because
mqrfe money means more pleasure. We
old socialists did the working-class a great
harm when we tried to interest it in
socialism. We should have adopted a
Fabian policy and stood loftily apart
from the working-class and the trade-
unions, appealing only to the think-
ing few. Only philosphers can under-
stand socialism —Plato knew that 24
centuries ago.
Marx started most of the trouble when
he wrote the Communist Manifesto in
1848. With the fervor of a Jewish
prophet he and Engels wrote “the spectre
of Communism haunts Europe—Com-
munists scorn to conceal their aims—
force is the midwife of the new order.”
Marx delighted in these obstetric phrases.
Now that the proletariat—always the
most unthinking in any civilisation—are
enthroned in the seats of the mighty,
civilisation is doomed. The trade-union
plea for a shorter work week is sheer
hypocrisy. I doubt if the 40-hour week
has sold one more good book, or that
a single worker devotes the increased
leisure of four hours to any form of
emotional and mental culture. In my
salad days, like many other impractical
idealists, I was an ardent socialist, but I
have long since put away such childish
things.
I do not know a single Labor politician
or official of any intelligence and experi-
ence who really believes in the working-
class, but for obvious reasons they would
never admit it. Michael Sawtell
(N.S.W.). .
A Good Excuse?
For the simple job of replacing the rear
tray of a utility truck Sydney firms quoted
me prices ranging from £45 (lowest) to
£6B (highest).
“It’s this 40-hour week,” they said.
“It’s put all our costs up —it’s the labor
on the job that you’ve got to pay for, not
the timber and iron that go into it.”
Being a “bit of a bush-carpenter,” I
tackled the job myself. Timber cost
£4 10s., iron fittings (I had to pay for
labor to shape the iron as I didn’t have
a forge) £3, and paint, bolts and nails
nearly £2. Say a tenner for all the
materials. It took me less than 60 hours
to do the job, and some of that time was
wasted in improvising tools that would
have been standard equipment in any
proper workshop. Perhaps the job lacks
a professional finish, but it is strong and
serviceable.
Here’s my point. A skilled workman
in a proper shop should have been able
to build that body in 40 hours —a labor
cost of about £lO. Add £lO for cost of
materials and another £5 for overhead —
£25 for the whole job. The quote of £45,
therefore, allows for a profit of £2O on an
investment of £25.
While the 40-hour week must raise costs
to some extent there are too many manu-
facturers who have seized this chance to
raise their profits also. Still, before long
they’ll have to adjust their ideas or find
they have insufficient work to keep their
labor employed even for 40 hours a week.
—C. R. (N.S.W.).
Private Enterprise
Before arguing that private enterprise
would starve without Government assist-
ance “Tidapa” (B. 11/2/’4B) should
compare production in America, which
enjoys a minimum of Government inter-
ference, with output in Britain and Aus-
tralia, where Government control is more
restrictive. “T.” will find that the lowest
production and the lowest standards of
living prevail where Government control
is complete, and that production rises and
falls in accordance with Government in-
terference in industry.
America is the greatest exponent of
free enterprise, and J. Ferguson, M.L.C.
and president of the N. S, Wales A.L.P.,
admitted in Parliament that the U.S. was
turning out 55 per cent, of the world’s
industrial production. Besides producing
enough to provide her citizens with the
highest standard of living, American ex-
ports last year were worth £3,000,000,000
more than imports. Uncle Sam did all
that with only seven per cent, of the
world’s people. On the other hand, in
socialist Britain and Australia, shortages
are common, while the great Socialist
Sixth country has, of course, been partly
living on loot.
“T.” predicts that in the near future
industry will only be able to operate with
Government assistance. If he is right,
then the standard of living in industrial
countries is marked for a crash. At the
moment socialist-governed countries are
living on doles and loans from the cita-
del of free enterprise.—K. Me. (N.S.W.).
Church Publicity
The Anglican Church in England,
which, like its Australian daughter, is
lamenting the shortage of clergy and
poorness of stipends, is talking of ap-
pointing a chief information secretary
who will act as public-relations officer
for the church and stir up greater pub-
licity.
In line with modern development, he
will have an assistant, secretary, three
press officers, a publishing officer and a
visual-aid officer. There will, presum-
ably, be the usual army of typists, office
messengers and stamp-lickers. The chief
official’s salary is to be £2OOO, plus
expenses.
No doubt the cost of the new depart-
ment will be paid from parish levies and
efforts organised by the local clergyman,
who has to be his own publicity man and
everything else combined on one-sixth
the stipend of the official he’ll help to
keep. I foresee a further shortage of
clergy and a crowd of applicants for the
publicity jobs.
Publicity is useful—the Founder of the
Christian church was Himself a great be-
liever in it. But He also laid great em-
phasis on pastoral personal approach to
this world’s citizens, and it is ‘ this side
which is largely neglected today because
of the shortage of man-power and the
inadequacy of provision for living and
maintenance.
At present Australian church authori-
ties have a bad headache in the prob-
lem of transport for the clergy in wide
areas. If the new department helps to
solve things like that there are some at
any rate who will feel happy. But ex-
perience of the deluge of special appeals
which occurs after every new scheme
for revolutionising things makes one
doubtful. More likely the scheme will
be another hefty straw on the camel’s
back. — Jeremiah (Tas.).
Beer and Betting
A visitor from Mars who studied
current press items for a few days might
believe that Australia had reached an
all-time high in drinking and gam-
bling. But he would have received
the same impression 20, 40 or 60 years
ago. Spectacular gambling has been re-
ported since Nat Gould’s days, and,
although beer receives a bit more space
at present because of shortages, the
wicked publican who fleeced shearers for
their cheques has been a popular villain
for donkey’s years.
Going further back you’d probably
find that the Roman equivalent of our
present-day rags carried booze and bet-
ting reports —and the usual crop of
squeals about bookmakers’ and wine-
merchants’ fortunes. Bookies and booze
merchants have long been popular tar-
gets for abuse from the men who have
made them rich —the men who haven’t
the brains to leave the odds or grog alone.
Survival of the fittest is one of the
oldest axioms in the world, and no
amount of legislation will prevent a man
from squandering hisi health or wealth if
he is not fitted to retain them. —C. R.
(N.S.W.).
Values
Two advertisements appeared in the
“Positions Vacant” columns of a Bris-
bane daily of January 26, 1948. The first
read:
Wanted governess, teach one boy, grade
I, correspondence, help house, wages £2,
14 miles R- —. Mrs. , .
Immediately under it appeared this one:
Wanted, exp. saloon barmaids, £4, clean,
live in. Apply Hotel. Phone .
—H. Norman (Q.).
Land Sales
Some months ago the Federal
Treasurer reduced by £125 the selling
price of a property in this district on the
ground that the comparable sale quoted
by the valuer showed a value of 4s. 9d.
per acre, whereas he had valued the
property sold at 12s. 6d, per acre. The
Treasury advised that, to support the
original sale price, another comparable
sale showing a higher acreage value than
that already quoted would have to be
submitted. The valuer then put forward
a comparable sale at 255. 6d. per acre.
The Treasury replied that the matter
could not be re-opened, and that the
practice of “jumping from one compar-
able sale to another was reprehensible.”
"Well, they, asked for it, Mum—they shouldn't have been on the grass."
What its attitude would have been had
the second comparable sale been quoted
first remains a mystery.
Later the sale of a farm for £3500 was
passed by the Treasury. Subsequently, the
buyer found himself unable to complete
the deal. Another buyer was found for
£3400 and the agreement submitted to the
Treasury. The vendor was then told that
his selling price had been reduced to
£3OOO. The Treasury explained on in-
quiry that, when considering the original
application, it had only the advice of
a valuer appointed by the Treasury for
this district. Its subsequent valuation
had apparently been based on the opinion
of a departmental valuer who visited the
district (a large one) for only a few days.
So much for the consistency of our
laws when administered by a bureaucracy.
—G.B.(Q.).
Youth -
Each generation may have condemned
the one following it (B. 4/2/’4B), but
what Noah said about his sons, or what
Grandma said about her daughters, is
immaterial. We can, however, judge by
the proven facts of today.
Never have young folks had so much
money and leisure or so many tempta-
tions. Never before have they had less
discipline. What used to be called par-
ental control is now called repression.
Liberty has been expanded into licence.
Early financial independence has bred
contempt for domestic authority. A
glance at divorce statistics alone proves
that time-honored standards of social
conduct are being more and more rapidly
lowered. The regrettable results may be
due to want of thought as well as want
of heart, but they do exist.
We may as well admit that the down-
ward trend began before the younger set
were born and that they are only carry-
ing on a tradition established by the
“emancipation” of women and the
“equalising” of the sexes during the boom
years. But we must accept the evidence,
even if it incriminates ourselves as having
set the example.— Jitterbugs (S.A.).
Root of the Matter
As “T. the R.” has noted in rhyme (B.
11/2/’4B) the P.M.G. is bringing out a
special stamp issue commemorating three
famous Australians. One of them is
Henry Lawson, but, believe it or not, he
is to be commemorated as a poet. If
Lawson had left only his poetry he would
be remembered as a very minor figure in
our literature ; his main contribution was
in the prose field of the short-story. Any-
one stimulated by the stamp to read
Lawson as the apex of Australian poets
will come away with a poor opinion
of our poetry. — Delilah (Vic.).
Some years ago my daughter bought a
block of land in a Sydney suburb. After
her recent marriage she and her husband
decided to build on the block; forms
were filled in and applications made to-
gether with all the fuss and bother that
go with trying to build a home in these
Government-controlled days. Eventually
the necessary permits were granted and
they were free to start building—when
they could get the material. Held up by
various shortages, they at length received
a letter from the local council stating
that unless they made use of the land
within a specified period the council
would resume the block for its- own pur-
poses.—D. R. I. (N.S.W.).
During the war many university
students with degrees were quickly pro-
moted to commissioned rank and drafted
to suitable jobs in the services. A num-
ber came straight in with commissions
They generally knew their particular sub-
ject—engineering, radio, etc.—but the}
knew precious little about soldiering
more important, about men. What
about reversing the process and making
all undergrads, attend an 0.T.C.? The)
would then be better equipped for an)
future shindy, and a lot of suffering*
misunderstanding and bad feeling be-
tween men and officers would be
avoided.— Katie (Q.),


turrets to clear their lungs of the stench
of burnt cordite.
Destroyer Attack
The strident clangor of Perth’s alarm-
bells closed the ship up in an instant.
“Stand by destroyer attack.” Almost as
one nearly a dozen Jap destroyers burst
through the smokescreen. Before they
had freed themselves of trailing wisps of
smoke the defensive fire hit them. One
destroyer lifted feet from the water and
fell to pieces as she dropped. Another’s
thin sides opened to the sea, like a split
paper-bag, and the impetus of her speed
laid her bulkheads flat. She rolled with
the sudden weight, her stern rose straight
from the water, and a thrill ran through
her as her propellers spun. Then she
was over and gone. Perfect counter-fire
smashed the attack, two more Jap
destroyers were destroyed, and the
attackers turned back into the smoke.
Then our destroyers—the seven remain-
ing—attacked. They disappeared into
their own smokescreen towards the
enemy, and that was the last Perth saw
of them. *
With nightfall the Allied squadron
formed up in line-ahead and cruised at
20 knots, De Ruyter leading, followed
by Perth, Java and Houston. Naviga-
tional dangers were considerable, with
the Indies close to southward and sets and
reefs all around. And somewhere in the
darkness that fell like a velvet curtain on
all sides the Japs were searching.
Night Action
Perth found them first —and carried
out what must surely be one of the out-
standing guiinery performances of the
war. Without radar, she sighted, ranged
on, opened fire at and hit with her second
broadside an enemy cruiser at 9006 yards.
Then, with tragic abruptness, half a
dozen flares lit the sea. Whether laid by
boat, submarine or aircraft is not known,
but they marked the Allied line perfectly.
In rapid succession the torpedoes came:
De Ruyter, directly ahead of Perth, blew
up in a blinding wall of flame, only a
violent alteration of course preventing
Perth’s driving into the wreckage ; and
Java was already in flames. Both ships’
magazines had exploded into their oil
tanks. With the Admiral gone, Captain
H. M. L. Waller, D.S.O. and Bar, R.A.N.,
was in command.
Fuel was not short, but ammunition
was, 6in. shells desperately, Perth and
Houston sailed at 28 knots straight
for Batavia. Daylight brought an
escort of three Hurricanes, and under
their cover the two ships reached Batavia
harbor at 1300 on Saturday afternoon.
Both ships left harbor at 2000 that night
and steamed to meet what all hands ex-
pected to be inevitable.
They found the enemy at 2311, Satur-
day, February 28, not far to the east-
ward of Sunda Strait. Perth again
opened the action At once searchlights
shone and criss-crossed over the black-
and-silver sea, a finger of light touched
Perth’s hull, came back and stayed there.
The whole night broke into flame, and
there was a mighty thunder of guns. The
Japanese fleet surrounded them, the sea
was full of enemy ships, and an incredible
quantity of high explosives was poured
into the last of the Allied vessels. Yet
Perth and Houston continued firing at,
and hitting, the enemy' transports. It is
estimated that they were opposed by five
cruisers, 11 destroyers and 35 transports.
The fight lasted nearly an hour, and
from the frenzy and desperation of that
time it is difficult to pick on orderly
sequence. One broadside exploded in a
storm of blast and splinters on Perth’s
open flag-deck. Another reduced the cata-
pult to tearing slivers of steel and hurled
the plane 40ft. to the dfeck below. The 4in.-
gun deck lifted under a direct hit, many
of its crew wiped out. “B” turret stopped
half a broadside, and when the flame and
smoke cleared its blackened guns were
crossed like a pair of scissors. But with
all the heat generated by bursting h.e.
there were no fires. Perth had
thoroughly learned her damage-control
lessons in the Mediterranean.
There were so many targets all turrets
were ordered into local control, each
mounting selecting and engaging its own.
The last range set on “X” turret’s local
sight was 600 yd.!
On the 4in.-gun deck they heard a rush-
ing whine. Past them in the murk shot a
huge Diesel destroyer. Depressed until
they just cleared the guard-rails the four-
inchers that were left raked him from stem
to stem. At 2330 Perth fired a battery
of four torpedoes at a looming destroyer.
It dissolved in flame and smoke. A salvo
landed amidships. Metal shrieked and
groaned and the crane and after-funnel
sagged over the remains of the pinnace.
The ship was the centre of a tumult, lit
by fire-bursts as vivid as huge flashes from
an oxyacetylene torch. At 0005 for-
rard ammunition was expended.
Torpedoes
Captain Waller decided to try to
break through the Sunda Strait, He
had just laid the ship on course when
from somewhere beneath the black sea
to starb’d there sprang the white wakes
of .loosened torpedoes. The first caught
the forrard engine-room. The after-
magazine crews, ammunition expended,
had come'on deck. The forrard crews
were trapped by an avalanche of water
Two more torpedoes exploded abreast the
sickbay, near the 4in. magazine. Merci-
fully it failed to ignite.
With a fourth torpedo striking aft
Captain Waller ordered abandon-ship.
He was last seen on his wrecked bridge in-
flating his lifebelt. The time was 0013,
Perth’s boats were shot to pieces, so
they lowered Carley rafts. A score of
wooden rafts on the foc’s’le, taken aboard
in Batavia, saved many lives. Captain
Waller had ordered his engines kept slow
ahead and pointed the ship landwards.
This carried the broken cruiser, still the
target of the most intense fire, clear of
men struggling in the water. At 20
minutes after midnight she listed sharply
to starb’d. She hung there a moment,
then came slowly upright. The weight
of water in her shifted and she leaned
slowly to port. Her bow dipped and
her starb’d quarter came up until the
slowly revolving screws turned in air.
The bow drank deeper of the encroaching
seas, until, still steaming and her battle
ensigns flying, she drovfe slowly under.
From time of “ammunition expended” to
time of sinking was 15 minutes.
Houston, flaming from end to end,
dropped hissing under the sea shortly
after.
About 300 men swam, crawled or were
pulled on to rafts and baulks of wood.
Throughout the night Jap destroyers
cruised among them, and the only man
picked up was one of Perth’s cooks, who,
being in white, was mistaken for one of
their own. t f
The sun rose on a sea fouled with
wreckage as far as the eye ranged.
Close by, Anjer lighthouse stood in the
green jungle, Perth had gone down five
miles north-west of St. Nicholas Point.
The sun rose higher, its rays falling
steeply out of a cobalt sky, and the
viscous oil fuel burnt the survivors’ skin.
Their fate in the hands of the Japs in
Java belongs to another story.
The Reckoning
fixeter, with British destroyer En-
counter, four American destroyers and
the Dutchman Witte de Witt, reached
Sourabaya. Exeter and Encounter, re-
fuelled and made a bid for Colombo.
The last heard from them was a signal:
“Enemy ships sighted ahead.” Witte de
Witt was bombed to the bottom of Soura-
baya harbor. So that of the whole Allied
squadron there were left only four
American destroyers.
No definite estimate of enemy losses
can be made. As Perth’s navigator put
it: “Targets were overwhelming.” To
p.-0.-w. Jap officers admitted to three
cruisers, nine destroyers, one aircraft-
tender and two transports sunk, but
official quarters feel this is exaggerated.
The transport the General com- '
manding the invasion force was certainly
sunk; and Perth’s survivors in‘the water
saw three transports and one converted
aircraft-tender beached on nearby Java.
Perhaps the soundest indication of the
ferocity of that last epic fight is the
testimony of a returned officer p;-0.-w.
“When we told them,” he said, “that
only two ships fought the final night-
action, the Jap interrogators bluntly
called us liars.”
The Wheat Harvest
What impressed me most about the
nearly-completed N. S. Wales wheat har-
vest was the lack of organisation. Trucks
lined up at silos and bag-stacks and
waited hours for unloading, while
carriers rarely managed more than two
loads daily. Despite the urgency of get-
ting the crop in, railway yards opened
only from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Mondays to
Fridays. With our long summer days,
two shifts could double the working
week.
Money was squandered in bulkhead
construction. Taking the £hort Dubbo
toi Gilgandra line, which is a typical ex-
ample, four bulkheads were proposed.
At Gilgandra materials were made avail-
able about the end of November, but
construction was so slow that the bulk-
head was not available until February
4, and even then it was not completed.
Those at Eumungerie and Balladoran
were abandoned when half-finished and
are now being dismantled. Talbragar
bulkhead was ready for the early har-
vest, but was not used, the site being con-
demned as too damp.
Most country toilers are still not ad-
verse to hard work or a few hours’ over-
time. It only needs a little intelligent
organisation to save thousands of pounds
in any future harvest, — Stanus (N.S.W.).
Pioneers of Today
I was recently at Goan Creek (N.S.W.),
where a dozen or so hardy families are
carving their farms out of practically
virgin forest country. With little en-
couragement from the Government they
are striving to clear and develop their
land while the menfolk keep the pot boil-
ing by cutting sleepers in the State forest
near by.
It’s a terrific job, and these struggling
“cockies” earned my admiration, in their
battle against the ironbark, box, scrub-
wattle, apple-gum and pine that have to
be cleared before the land becomes arable.
Begun as a soldier-settlement after
1914-18, the Goan Creek region is part
of Murrungundy station. Of the eight
original soldier-settlers who took up land
there, only one remains. The scrub has
taken the edge off many an axe and many
a settler. Most leases are of 1000 acres,
and those that are highly developed have
only about 500 acres cleared and arable.
Others range from 160 down to five acres.
These modem pioneers grow wheat and
oats and raise sheep, pigs and a few
cattle. Their difficulties are many, in-
cluding lack of assistance from the Gov-
ernment. All the settlers I yarne# with
said that, if they could get enough wire
and netting to subdivide and enclose
some areas, production, particularly of
pigmeat, would leap ahead. A bridge over
the frequently-flooding Talbragar River is
another urgent need.
There are many of these little-known
parts of Australia where men and women
arp doing the hard “yakka” of pioneer-
ing new soil. — Japha, (N.S.W.).
Farm Shortages
From my fencing manoeuvres I hailed
the Car of a small retail agent. He
stopped with a friendly but protesting
wave of the hand. “Don’t want your
order, old chap,” he grinned. “Whatever it
is, I bet I won’t be able to get it.” “Just
the same,” I persisted, “you’ve got to put
me down for a mile of wire-netting.”
He looked helpless and explained that
already on his books were orders amount-
ing to over 1000 miles of netting. “And,”
he added, “with netting already two years
behind on orders for soldier-settlers, who
have a priority, what chance has an old-
timer like you?” >
The position is growing worse. On
every hand farmers are calling desper-
ately for materials. During the war, and
for a while afterwards, shortages of net-
ting, wire, gates, traps, etc., were under-
standable, Now, with so much man-
power in industry, the man-on-the-land
is asking for the reason behind these pro-
duction-killing shortages. And he has a
right to know. He doesn’t want some
prefabricated explanation, tendered with
a view to keeping him quiet. Strikes he
accepts as a contributing factor only.
Taxation? He wonders.
With good seasons and good harvests,
we go short of home products and
resignedly accept something else. For
fencing material and farm supplies there
is no substitute. We’re accustomed to
rabbits, dingoes, wombats, crows, eagles,
droughts, floods, plagues, taxation, market
fluctuations. Government restrictions,
“hooey” forms and kindred things. But
this latest pest, “shortages,” threatens to
hamstrung us completely.— Eastern
(Vic.). ' ;
Wheatgrowing
With present high prices for wheat the [
tendency will be to increase areas sown ; i
the move most likely extending to mar- J
ginal areas where land is cheap, easy to
cultivate and a large expanse can be sown j
with little fallowing. Any such move
should be closely watched.
In about 1926-27 a Bulletin sub-
leader warned the Collier Government of
Westralia against opening up the low-
rainfall areas in that State for wheat-
farming. The warning was not heeded
and the results were disastrous —debts and
difficulties are still being grappled with
in every State following the land-settle-
ment programme of that day. That 20-
year-old warning should be republished
as a reminder to legislators in wheat-
growing States, and as a warning to men
anxious to take up wheatgrowing of the
possible dangers ahead should they be
attracted by high wheat prices to take up
low-priced holdings in uncertain rainfall
areas.
As a bank manager for 30 years, half
of them in “marginal” areas, I know the
fascination of cheap land and high prices.
But the wheatgrower must have a reason-
able average return to pay his way. There
must be an eventual fall in the price of
' wheat, and the rainfall in “marginal
areas” is all too fickle. I have seen
hard-working men and women walk off
their holdings, beaten by Nature after
years of heart-breaking sacrifice.
C.B. M. (N.S.W.).
Disraeli, the Prophet
To those pertinent Disraeli quotations
(B. 11/2/’4B) let me add what the great
Jew said in the House of Commons when
the American Civil War was still in pro-
gress and when France was speeding to
another disaster. He reviewed the con-
dition of England, its “ancient,, powerful
and richly-endowed'Church” ; its “perfect
religious liberty” ; its “unbroken order
and complete freedom”; its “landed
estates, commercial enterprise, system ’of
credit, scheme of labor and industry” ; all
“mighty creations”; and “with this you
have erected the greatest empire of
modern times.” Then he said:
Ifi you destroy that state of society re-
member that England cannot begin again.
The United States could, France could, but
England, the England we know could
S.'Xr *SSt £.V&33 woSd
become a howling wilderness, or doubt that
the good sense of the people would to
some degree prevail, and some fragments
of the national character survive; but it
would not be the old England, the Eng-
land of power and tradition and capital
“Hey, stop—this is urgent !”
that now exists. It is not in the nature of
things.
These warnings must be much in the
minds of Attlee and Cripps in their dark
hours. — Amateur Historian (N.S.W.).
Tea ;
Having spent about 10 years on tea-
plantations in Ceylon, T can assure
“X.E.D.” (B. 11/2/*4B) that tea could
not be grown as a paying crop in Aus-
tralia unless it could be sold at the same
price per nip as Scotch. Even at “five bob
a pound” the growers would need a
bi f? er Government handout than T.-A.A,
Cjoou tea must be grown at an eleva-
tion of at least 4000 ft. and needs an
annual rainfall of 300-350 inches. An
. .„ . , „- + t,
average estate is about 1000 acres with
3000-3500 bushels per acre. To look after
these, and to attend to pruning, terracing,
draining, weeding and plucking, about
1250 coolies are needed. These (Tamils
in Ceylon) work from sunrise to sunset
for a shilling a day, living in “lines” with
four coolies to a room. Imagine the
answer of any good Australian trade-
unionist to such a proposition.
If, presuming he can find in Australia
a suitable site and climate, “X.E.D.” can
then get enough labor to \york his estate
I’ll gladly drink every pint of tea he
can produce for five bob a pound.—
H.H.S. (N.S.W.).
