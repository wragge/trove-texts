THIS Company is being I l ined to purchase the well-known gold-mine of the Sir John Franklyn
Company, lease No. 3531), Beeohworth, comprising about 22J acres, situated on the Never Mind
Spur, near Wood’s Point, for the purpose of opening up and developing the property at a greater
depth than the mine has yet been worked.
The cost of workiug the mine can be reduced to a minimum on account of the facilities afforded by
tunnels. The property was extensively worked in the early days, and again in the years 1877 to 1880.
During the latter period alone the total amount of gold won exceeded 17,0000 z. The stone in the
lower workings is much mineralised, and with proper concentrating plant would now be highly
profitable.
Extracts from the Reports of A. B. Ainsworth, Esq., District Mining Surveyor, Alexandra :
“ An adit level, some 1139 ft. long, has been driven towards the dyke through hard rock, at a
depth of some 200 ft. below the old workings, and thus a block of ground about 200 ft. deep and 1600 ft.
in length, on the strike of the main dyke, through the lease block—through which practically only one
vein has been partially stoped, and hardly any part methodically prospected by crosscuts, &c. —finds
issue on the face of the hill, and can thus be economically explored and developed. Indeed, this
expensive piece of work affords a key—the only one—to the entire hill, and gives a special value of
position to the block.
“ Persons well acquainted with the mine assert the existence, to their knowledge, of one block of
ground within easy reach of this adit level, from which large yields are anticipated.
“ I regret that time has not permitted of sections of this promising mining property being pre-
pared, as they would have shown clearly the value to incomers of the dead work done and the working
facilities extant from the adit level to the surface. It may be remarked, as regards this property, that
the mine has hitherto responded handsomely to intelligent outlays of capital and good management,
like other of our standard mines, notably the New Loch Fyne, Hope, and Great Eldorado, which are
again being worked and are proving themselves first-class ventures at small outlays, after long years
of idleness, and I trust it will form another link in the chain of successes that promise to secure to
this much neglected but exceptionally rich district a fair trial and a commensurate prosperous mining
career, in harmony with its early developments, which equalled or excelled, for a few years, those of
any other field in Victoria.”

This company is being formed to acquire Lease No. 248/93M, situated at North Dundas, imme-
diately to the west of and adjoining the property of the Curtin and Davis Extended Company. The
lease comprises 69 acres or thereabouts.
rhe North-east Dundas tramway passes through a portion of tho company’s property at the
north, so that there will be excellent facilities for conveying the ore from the mine, which can be
perhaps less expensively worked than any other on the field
The following report has been received from Mr. W. Euddon, M.E., the manager of the Comet S Iver-mining Company No Liability:-
Dundas, May 25, 1896.
F. E. Harris, Esq., Austral-chambers, Mel-
bourne.
Dear Sir, —At you request I visited and in-
spected the property known as the South-West
Curtin and Davis, situated at North-east Dundas
and to the south-west of the Curtin and Davis
S.M. Co.
The property consists of one 69-acre section
situated on the north-west slope of a very steep
hill, the elevation being from base to summit
1150 ft.
I find on examination that three lodes have been
discovered. No. 1 lode is situated near the sum-
mit of the hill, and next the eastern boundary of
the property. At present there has not been
much attention given to this lode by way of pros-
pecting, and by its strike I am of opinion it will
prove to be a continuation of tfie No. 2 lode.
No. 2 lode-—This has been the principal develop-
ment-on the property, and the greatest interest
has been shown in the opening and developing the
same. It is situated about the centre of the pro-
perty, tiie lode having been opened and exposed
for a distance of 9 chains along the side of the
hill. The lode is well defined and between two
good walls. The oountry rock on the footwall is
composed of a very close slate, the hanging-wall is
composed of a hard conglomerate. The lode at
the surface is e imposed of gossan, which at the
depth of a few feet gives place to iron and copper,
pyrites and phyl ore, very rich in silver, assays
from which have given the following results :
Silver, ftoin 160 oz. to 2910 z. per ton ; copper, from
12 per cent, to 28 per cent, per ton.
At the time of my visit the lode had been
stripped and based for a distance of 2 to 3 chains,
the ore being left standing in places from 3ft. to
4ft. high, which would average from Ift. to 18in.
wide for a distance of 120 ft. A shaft has been
sunk to a depth of 20ft. on the lode at this point,
the average width of lode in this shaft being Ift
of clean ore. From 6to 8 tons of ore have been
won in sinking the shaft. This ore, I estimate,
should bulk, according to assays taken by the
manager (who kindly supplied me with the returns
from the same), 160 oz. silver and 16 per cent,
copper per ton.
The strike of No. 2 lode is 12deg. east of north,
with an easterly underlay of about Ift. in 3ft. into
the hill. At present a tunnel is being driven into
the hill to intersect this lode at a depth of about
80ft. The tunnel should reach the lode in about
80ft. to 90ft. driving, and should the lode be met
at this level, which I have no doubt it will be, a
considerable quantity of ore can be raised cheaply.
Adits can be driven lower down the hill, and as
much as 400 ft. to 500 ft. of backs can be obtained,
thus doing away with expensive machinery.
No. 3 lode is situated near tlm northern boun-
dary of property, and midway between east and
west boundary. At present little or no prospect-
ing has been done other than by a cut where the
lode is exposed. The lode contains about 3ft. of
lode matter, 6in. to Sin. of the hanging-wall por-
tion being composed of iron and copper pyrites.
Strike, of lode IBdeg. west of north, with rut
easterly underlay.
The property as a whole I consider a very valu-
able one, No. 2 lode especially showing 1 a good
body of rich ore, with fully 100 ft. stripped along
the line ready for breaking down, which I estimate
should produce 100 tons of marketable ore.
The North-east Dundas tram passes through the
property at the foot of the hill 400 ft. below the
outcrop of No. 2 lode, and the ore from same can
be easily and cheaply conducted to the Govern-
ment tram by means of self-acting tram. Taking
into consideration the position of this property
and the splendid facilities offered for carrying on
cheap mining by driving adits, together with the
rich ores proved to exist on the property, I have,
no hesitation in recommending it to the public as
one that will in the,near future, with a reasonable
amount of capital expended to further develop,
become a valuable property.
I am, dear sir, yours, &c.,
(Signed) W. BUDIION.
LITERARY NOTES.
The writer once shared a railway compart-
ment for a couple of hours with Wil-
liam Bede Dailey—one/ ofi the finest and
most cultivated intelligences that Australia
has nourished. The talk fell on books.
Dailey said that, looking back »ver his
life, he could plainly trace successive
phases of intellectual development—just
as, looking at the ' side of a cliff,
one can sometimes distinguish the suc-
cession of superposed geological strata.
Fiction was his first love in literature—he
was a glutton of novels when a boy. Then
he drifted in. j poetry, and from poetry into
history, and from history into science, and
from science onward to philosophy. “ And
now?” “Now,” said Dailey, “I enjoy
literature in all its manifestations. But if
there is one class of books I prefer to
another, I.think it must be”—with a flash
of his teeth—“ why, New Books ! ”
* * * •
There is no disputing the seduction of
New Books for Australians. The “new”
books are always “ out” at the libraries, and
one may keep an “old ” book thrice as long;
while to every well-regulated metropolitan
bookshop is attached a staff of customers who
know the weekly European mail-day better
than the paid employees, and can calculate to
a nicety the time when the cold chisel will
creak musically into the tops of the precious
cases behind the counter. Then and there
they cluster like ants round a honeycomb,
happy to be permitted to hold the hammer.
“It is their hour,” as Mr. Pinero puts it.
“There is only one hour in a bookman’s
week,” says the Notorious Mrs. Ebbsinith—
“ one supreme hour. His poor life is like
the arch of a crescent: so many days
lead up to that hour, so many weary days
decline from it. No matter what he
may strive for, there is a moment when
the Case Mail taps him upon the shoulder
and says, “ Man, this hour is the best that
Literature has to spare you.” It may come
to him in calm or in tempest, lighted by the
steady radiance of William Lecky or by the
glitter of the evil stars of Marie Corelli ; but
however it comes, be it good or evil, it is his
hour —let him dwell upon every second of
• * * *
Doubtless Dailey and Pinero knew what
they were talking about. In the gloss and
crackle of new hooks there is a bewitching
beaute du diable which will stir liter-
ary blood in spite of all the maxims of ex-
perience. You have been stirred by it before:
you know it won’t last : you half turn away
to the time-tested second-hand shelf : then
the leaves flutter as some curious Columbus-
customer peers between the uncut pages, and
your heart flutters too —you are undone.
Poor little bird, once more in the coils of
the serpent ! and . . . how delightful it
is ! in spite of right-thinking Emerson, with
his
Rule I.—Never read any book that is not a
year old—
a rule which he was himself not too careful
to keep. And the best of it is that all the
booksellers advertise that * ‘ customers are not
pressed to buy.” They don’t care for your
money, but they like you to be an ornamen-
tal presence in the shop, and lean pictur-
esquely against the shelves, and add a certain
tone and distinction to the rows of classics.
The booksellers’ own special newspapers are
continually urging the backward subscriber
to dare to be a Daniel— better than a Daniel!
—and try and make an attractive little den
for literary lions to come and pick their
horrid little bones in. “And d—n the
sales ! ” said one vigorous organ recently.
So the New-Book lover is always in a glow
with thinking of himself as a knight bravely
spurring his hobby to the assistance of some
bookshopping damn-sell in distress.
• * * •
The case may be summed up with the help
of some quite unseasonable verses written
“ for The Bulletin ” and called
The newest book of specially Australian
interest is “ A First Fleet Family,” by Louis
Becke and Walter Jeffery. In contrast to
Becke’s earlier books, this is dull and dis-
appointing. Part is history ; part fiction ;
but the fiction is merely laid on top of the
history, not woven into it to make a histori-
cal novel, so the book is neither fish, flesh,
nor good red herring. This is a pity ; for
the authors have taken much pains to make
a decent narrative ; and the central incident
—the escape of William Bryant and party
from Port Jackson convict - settlement in
1791, and their extraordinary voyage to
Timor in a small boat—has inspiration enough
for anything.
* * * •
Inspiration, however, is precisely what the
book lacks : it is heavy and mechanical
throughout. The first seven chapters sup-
ply a romantic English introduction in
the style of Conan Doyle and the
minor historical novelists of the Strand
Magazine, and of no particular interest.
Then comes an account of the first
fleet’s voyage to Australia, and the early days
of the convict-settlement. This is appar-
ently paraphrased, for the most part, from
the second edition of Collins’s “Account
of the English Colony in N.S. Wales ”
(based on Lieut.-Gov. King’s papers), and
gains nothing in the paraphrasing. Becke
invents an account of the voyage to Timor ;
and the tale closes with more dubious Eng-
lish romance. Barring the apocryphal Ser-
geant Dew, the supposed teller of the story,
over whom a good deal of trouble has been
taken, the characters are lay figures. The
epithets and descriptions do not picture them
to the mind : there is no moving invention in
the book, no creative imagination. Try
their hardest, the authors can never write
convincingly. Here, for example, is part of
what is intended for “ a purple passage ” —
the description of the death of the heroine’s
infant :—
For many days before, Will and I had seen that
the grey shadows of death were clouding the once
bright face and sweet blue eyes of our boy, and
oft at night, when our boat sped silently along
under the starlit sky, I would sit holding his
slight, wasted form in my arms, and my tears of
repentance for my mad and cruel folly would
fall upon his pinched and deathlike features.
And, as if the dear child knew what it was that
so wrecked my wicked heart, he would sometimes
open his fast-fading eyes, and his little hand
would seek mine, and give it a faint pressure, and
then the white lids would droop and close again.
Almost as the boat touched the sand, the small,
tender form trembled gently in my arms, his eyes
met mine for the last time in this world, and, with
a sigh that stabbed me to the heart, he died.
This fine-journalese is supposed to be uttered
by an anguished mother, a last-century Eng-
lish peasant ! Not thus does Becke write
when he feels and knows his situation : not
thus die the wife of Macy O’Shea and the
victims of Tia Kau.
* * * *
When Mrs. Watson, the heroine of Lizard
Island (N.Q.) fled with her baby in 1881
to perish miserably of thirst and hunger,
the imagination of her sufferings fired one
“8.K.” to publish in a Cooktown paper
these poor little ungrammatical lines: —
Ob, for a drink from the waters of Dee !
Or a breath from the ice crest of Bonnie Ben Nee.
Oh, for a sough through a green birken tree,
To cool the hot brows of my Baby and me.
Thou God of our fathers,
If some one must dee,
In mercy save Baby,
And tak’ awa’ me.
Cling close to me, darling,
While I go to rest !
Thou mayst still suckle life
From my poor starved breast.
Cling close to me, darling,
As the last night comes down,
I see heaven open to lower me a crown;
I still feel thy dear head,
Still see thy blue ’ee !
And now God save Baby,
And tak’ awa’ me.
Compare the truth, and pathos, and reality,
and poetry of this with the pretensions of
the passage printed above. This is a cry
from the heart, to the heart. The woman
who wrote it. by dint of deep, emotion, iden-
tified herself with Mrs. Watson, thought and
felt with her, as the authors of “A First
Fleet Family ” have never succeeded in
thinking with Mary Broad. Their book
represents a lot of work and ability ; but it
fails in one thing—it isn’t alive.
Some further notes of Stevenson, from
Mrs. Strong’s reminiscences in Scribner’s :
S. said he thought his own gift lay in the grim
and terrible —that some writers touch the heart,
he clutched at the throat. I said I thought “Pro-
vidence and the Guitar ” a very pretty story, full
of sweetness and the milk of human kindness.
“ E’t it is not so sweet as ‘ Markheirn ’ is grim.
There I feel myself strong.”
“ At least,” I said, “ you have no mannerisms.”
He took the book out of my hand and read “ it
was a wonderful clear night of stars.” “Oh,” he
said, “ how many, many times I have written ‘ a
wonderful clear night of stars’! ”
But I maintained that this, in itself, was a good
sentence and presented a picture to the mind.
“ It is the mannerisms of the author who can’t
say ‘says he’ and ‘says she ’ that I object to;
whose characters hiss, and thunder, and ejaculate
and syllable ”
“ O my dear,” he said, “ deal gently with me-*
I once fluted ! ”
* • • •
Again : —
I asked Louis why painters, who live in much
the same atmosphere as literary men, are less in-
teresting and more narrow-minded ; at least, that
had been my experience. He offered an explana-
tion that sounded reasonable enough. The study
of painting or music does not expand the mind in
any direction save one. Literature, with its study
of human nature, events, and history, is a con-
stant education, and in that career a man cannot
stick at one place as the painter and musician
almost invariably do. He studies his one pin’s
point of a talent, enlarging that, perhaps, and
deepening it, but in no other direction does his
mind work. The bank-clerk, who e daily life is
spent in adding-up figures, knows that his intelli-
gence is cramped, and is more apt to devote his
leisure to study and improvement; but the painter
believes his work to be a culture, and thinks he
needs no more.
RENAISSANCE.
In my ears it is sounding to-day,
The song of the Spring !
How my heart leaps, and urges the blood in swift
surges to greet the sweet Spring !
And my pulse, from low undertones rising to
thunder tones, trumpets the challenge of
mystical May,
Of witching September, while Winter’s dull ember
Glows fierce in the glamour of Spring,
The passion-fed furnace of Spring!
And my Love, she is tingling to-day
To the touch of the Sprint !
How she t embles and thrills as from numberless
rills pou s the full tide of Spring !
And her eyes are veiled oceans whence amorous
potions I quaff in a fury, as one who is fey :
She bears me no malice, but holds up for chalice
Her lips brimming over with Spring,
All ruddied and coralled with Spring J
O my Youth ! let us make holiday,
Give a garland to Spring !
For you flower from her root and your ecstasies
shoot from the sources of Spring !
Not a throb gay or tragic her alcnemy magic has
missed from the cycles of worlds passed
away :
Kiss of atoms thick-thronging, sighs of spheres
mad with longing,
A Deity burning, a Universe yearning—
All summed up in Spring!
Now, New Books are the Spring of Litera-
ture.
The hot-hearted sun,
And the brazen-faced sea
Have no pity or mercy
For Baby and me.
The white gulls skim swiftly,
The bright sails fly free,
But they bring us no succour
For Baby and me.
Thou Great One and Good One
Who rulest the sky,
Send rain to the parched lips
Of Baby and I.
Nevertheless, “A First Fleet Family ” is
quite likely to be “a success,” especially in
England. “ For,” as an English publisher’s
Australian representative remarked the other
day, “ to get the public tasfc* in literary
matters, deduct just 33 per oent. from a
Bulletin judgment.” And 33 per cent, is a
sufficiently profitable margin.
BROWN EYES-A FANCY.
Her dreamy eyes are deep
As the fathomless eyes of sleep,
And will no love declare,
Nor laugh nor weep ;
And daring souls who dive
Into the water brown,
To win the secrets there,
Sink and drown,
Or else are chained alive
A thousand fathoms down.

Dr. GIBBONS,
Wh» is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS & SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them, lie
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after' eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or fape, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of. the hair, <V.c.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt of 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,

fully describing how all private, nervous, and
skin diseases may be quickly and permanently
CURED, without loss of time and money. This
book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
ONE EOUND is Sufficient to Send
for Remedies necessary for the Cure of
DEBILIT Y,
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “ Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DOjNOT DELAY,

reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
DR. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6d. in
stamps, and Dr. Gibbons will send you, post
free, the Latest Edition of his Celebrated Work,
in which you will find a list of carefully-prepared
questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.

“AS YOU LIKE IT.”
Dreams in the glamour of an old romance,
Woven around a perilous love forlorn ;
-d ond eyes that yearn upon the waves’ expanse
x or a wan sail in shadowy gulfs outworn ;
immured long vacant years,
Waiting for love in some forgotten keep
Untenanted by anything but tears,
Unvisited by anything but sleep.
Where are ye fled, 0, passionate, wild days ?
vi'uj® 18 yOUr ma gi. c that w as wont to be
x lushed on the summits in the morning rays,
And in the twilight of the western sea ?
Where are the hearts that thrilled for Rosalind ’
_Wl, e are the eyes that Celia has blest?
" hy do we beat the air for ever dinned
With the great anguish of a great unrest ?
Return, O Time, the jewels thou hast thieved,
-IhoiigTi Shakespeare come not (he is a caress
t’ the fond spirit); surely we have grieved
Even enough to move a god’s distress !
Return the ark of life, the large domain
Over all gaiety, the wine, the song ;
Even if Pan shall never rule again,
May we not smile at life, alert and strong ?
If every leaf within the wild Ardennes,
If every brook that babbles to the deer
Murmurs the charm that lulled the forest glens,
Shall we not sit, and dream, and love, and hear?
Sweetness and light to spirits that are dim,
Sad with the whole of querulous excess,
Float with the music of the sylvan hymn,
Lost in Joy’s rosy-tangled wilderness.

LEAF MUSIC.
Listen, the winds are playing
A fugue in the orchard trees.
They creep through the boughs of apple
And linger among their leaves,
And touch, with a gentler straying,
Leaves over-soon decaying.
The winds come singing, singing,
Through leaves with a silken sheen.
This song is a silver treble,
With an alto note washed in.
It sounds like an apple flinging
On grass the sun is stinging.
But oh, when winds come rushing
Through wattle, when day’s at noon !
Set soft, like a mother’s murmur
Into ears when the eyelids droop.
Set low, like a, bee’s hum hushing
The flowers his lips are brushing.
OR gleaming, dripping wattle !
The wind, when it blows through you
Is a velvet-throated singer,
And it sings to a golden tune.
All noon, where the noon-lights mottle,
I lie and listen, wattle.
And, list’ning, pass the border
Where only a child may stray,
Into the land of fairies ...
The years since I went that way !
Ah, wattle ! are you the warder
That guards that dim, dear border ?
The wind loves warm-leaved apples,
Warm-hued in the light or shade.
The song has a deeper setting
That blows through a leafy spray
Gone red as the blood-red maples,
Or sunset sky at Naples.
But stealing through the edges
Of gums, with the curl still green,
An exquisite treble dances
And thrills to the lightest breeze.
Not Pan’s own reeds nor sedges
Ring sweet as young gums’ edges.

A disgraceful display of ruffianism occurred on
Saturday at Homebush in connection with the
second Junior football match, Homebush v. Orient-
al. From tl)p start Oriental made the game very,
“willing," and the referee, Mr. H. Hazel, with a
commendable determination to enforce tha rules
regarding rough play, ordered two of the visiting
team off the field. This 1 action, coupled with the
subsequent defeat of the Oriental team by 12
po.nts to nil, so enraged the players_and their
supporters that they proceeded to “deal it ouf’
to the referee at the conclusion of the maicai,
kicking and striking him in the most brutal
nsr, and showering upon him mud and other misA
sues. In self-defence Mr. Hazel was compelled'
to draw a revolver, with which he had coma
armed.

SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1896.
An Imperial Customs Union.
The first of the London Statist’s two prize
essays on the subject of an Imperial Zoll-
verein has now come to hand, and a serious
consideration of its contents only serves to
accentuate the remoteness and hopelessness
of the whole business so long as J. Bull
remains what he is. The idea of an Imperial
Zollverein was, in the first place, a modified
and more practical version of the nearly
extinct dream of Imperial Federation. The
former means union on a cash basis of
common interest; the latter implied union
on a basis of loyalty, and drivel, and histori-
cal glare, and howl about “the Flag.” It
provided, first and foremost, that the Empire
was to be governed in all large matters by a
central Parliament made up of representa-
tives of all the white races of Victoria’s
dominions ; and as the United Kingdom
contains a majority of these white races, this
necessarily implied that Australia, Maori-
land, Canada, and other outlying provinces
were to surrender their self-governing powers
almost bodily to J. Bull. In addition
they were to bear a proportion of the cost of
the British armaments, and, whatever terms
might be made when the alliance was first
entered into, the fixing of that proportion
must depend ultimately on the vote of the
British majority. Also, the colonies were to
have a share in the right to barrack for British
traditions and over the glories of Poitiers
and Agincourt and Balaclava —with Fontenoy
and Steinkirk and Neerwinden and Patay
and Bouvines thrown in if desired. Like-
Avise, they were offered the privilege of cheer-
ing for a country which they have no special
desire to cheer about, and the right to whoop
over what somebody else did at Inkermann
and elsewhere, and a sort of unspecified
authority to profess that they were the person
Avho did it, or ivho would have done it if they
had been there, or at least that they were
the small brother Samuel of the person who
really was there. And, as the price seemed
too high a one to pay for the privilege of
being anybody’s small brother, the negotia-
tion naturally came to nothing. It was a
shadowy affair at the beginning, and it never
amounted to more than a shadow.
The proposal to link the straggling empire
together by a Customs Union was the same
scheme, with the glare and whoop and dazzle
left out and sundry new considerations in-
serted. The idea was that the various parts
of the empire should extend to each other
special trade privileges which would be denied
to foreign countries. They would be so
adjusted, if possible, as to be mutually
advantageous, and as secession would mean
the loss of these privileges, it would, there-
fore, be to the interest of the colonies to
adhere to the mother country, and to the in-
terest of the mothdr country that they should
aclhere. If such a union was constructed on
the principle of Freetrade, or something
appproaching it, within the empire, and
definite Protection against all outside States,
it certainly looks as if it might be workable.
Assuming that Australian wool, tallow, wine,
meat, dairy produce, and other staples were
substantially protected in the British
markets against Argentina, Russia, France,
Spain, the United States, and all other ex-
traneous competitors, and that protection
was dependent on Australia’s continued con-
nection with the empire and on its willing-
ness to admit purely British manufactures
freely into Australia, it is quite possible that
the British market would become so valuable
that it would be worth this country’s while to
admit British goods free, and to belong to
the empire, and even to make considerable
sacrifices, if necessary, to hold the empire
together. And for the sake of holding the
empire together, and in return for a practical
monopoly of the colonial trade, it is quite
possible that the arrangement would be worth
Britain’s also while. There is no certainty
about the matter on either side, but the
experiment certainly looks as if it might be
feasible. But J. Bull is addicted to giving
very little and asking very much ; and, more-
over, the circumstances of Britain and the
other provinces of the empire are so wholly
dissimilar that agreement with a person of
the Bull calibre seems next to impossible.
* * * *
Freetrade undoubtedly suits Britain better
than it does any other country in the world.
In the last two centuries all the other coun-
tries of Europe have been devastated with
fire and sword, their commerce wrecked,
their towns besieged, and their industries
reduced to dust and ashes over and over
again ; while Britain escaped invasion and
rose to affluence on their ruins. Britain is
now the great creditor nation of the world,
and has an annual income of probably
£150,000,000 a year from its investments in
other parts of the globe. Therefore, though
Freetrade has practically killed its agricul-
ture, and its manufactures are not increas-
ing, and its exports are vastly less than its
imports, and its markets are flooded with
the goods of every nation on earth to the
serious detriment of its own artisans, the
aggregate wealth of the country keeps in-
creasing. The interest on foreign invest-
ments more than makes up all deficiencies.
Great Britain is becoming the retired old
woman among nations—the affluent old
woman who lives on a safe annuity and who
doesn’t require to work. If nothing happens
to overturn the present order of things
British exports will remain stationary or
diminish, and imports will keep increasing,
and the agricultural class will almost entirely
die out, and the manufacturing class will
begin to do likewise—and yet the aggregate
wealth of Britain will keep on expanding
indefinitely by the great law of compound
interest. If Britain entered into a Customs
Union whereby her ports were practically
closed against all States lying outside the
empire it would give a great stimulus to
the prosperity of the colonies. It would also
give an immense lift to the British artisan
and the decaying British agriculturist ; and,
in all probability, it would wreck a very
large proportion of the country’s foreign
investments.
* ♦ * *
Britain’s debtors pay her mostly in goods;
they can’t pay her any other way, for all the
coin on earth wouldn’t liquidate the bill for
more than ten years, or thereabouts. There-
fore, if Britain, by giving a heavy tariff pre-
ference to the empire, practically refused to
receive these goods, her debtors outside the
empire would mostly go broke. Such a pro-
ceeding would certainly do much for the
agricultural and artisan class of the United
Kingdom—it would find work for the bone
and sinew of the nation in growing the wheat
which is now grown in Russia and America
and Hungary, and in forging the iron which
now comes from Belgium, and in making all
the miscellaneous goods which, under present
conditions, are “made in Germany.” But
it would to a great extent sink the old-
woman-with-an-annuity aspect of the nation.
Britain is the one country occupied by a
civilised white race with a decent standard of
living to which Freetrade is not wholly
disastrous. The tendency of Freetrade, in
every country where decent wages and mode-
rate hours of labor prevail, is to kill off local
industries by the competition of toilers in
other countries who work longer hours and
receive less wages, and whose products are
consequently cheaper. But through past
accumulations —the result of enterprise and
plunder, and superlative good fortune—
Britain has an income independent of per-
sonal exertion, which, despite all these
drawbacks, keeps the country from growing
poorer in the aggregate. And no other
country occupies anything even distantly
resembling this position, therefore the fact
that Freetrade has compensating features in
England is not the slightest evidence in its
favor elsewhere.
The situation of the other provinces of the
Empire is the exact reverse of ail this. They
have no income from foreign investments.
They are large debtors instead of large credi-
tors, and have to send away vast sums
annually as interest instead of receiving
them. They must export more than they
import to pay their interest, unless they
keep going further and further into debt,
whereas the normal condition of Britain is to
import more than she exports. To do this
they must foster local industries to provide
exports and to enable them to do without
foreign goods as far as possible, and they
must keep down imports by artificial means,
because their conditions are wholly artificial.
The Freetrade theory that trade takes care
of itself and is best left alone, and that ex-
ports and imports naturally balance each
other, because exports pay for imports and
nobody will send to a country more value
than he receives from it, is possibly accurate
enough under natural conditions —these being
that a country neither owes money abroad
nor has money owing to it. But, as these
conditions don’t prevail anywhere, the theory
amounts to nothing. And under these wholly
diverse circumstances the project of estab-
lishing an Imperial zollverein which will be
satisfactory to all parties is very like trying
to add together half-a-mile and half-a-crown
and produce an understandable result. Ob-
viously, one party must make concessions,
and J. Bull, as the individual who wants an
Imperial Union and as the one who is most
able to afford concessions, must be that party
to a very great extent if anything is to be
done.
* * * *
The Statist’s first prize essay, already
published, presumably received the prize
because, in the opinion of the two eminent
judges, it was a fair and reasonable solution
of the difficulty. It is, therefore, interesting
as showing what J. Bull in general regards,
or is supposed to regard, as a fair solution.
The theory set forth can be compressed into
a very short space. It is proposed in the
first instance that Britain shall place a 3 per
cent, duty on live and dead meat, cheese,
butter, wheat, flour, hemp, sugar, leather,
wool, tallow, skins, mahogany and ivory—
only that and nothing more. So far as Aus-
tralasia is concerned, the 3 per cent, differ-
ence on these articles is not sufficient to make
up for the advantages in freight possessed by
Russia, Denmark, Holland, France, the
United States, and other nearer rivals, and
it hardly even puts this country on a level
with Argentina or Brazil. Three per cent,
when meat sells at 3d. per lb. is something
like one-third of a farthing per lb., which is
the weakest kind of Protection on record.
Against this it is suggested that the depen-
dencies should levy duties of about 10 per
cent, on imported manufactured goods not
of British origin. This means that the
dear old mother country is to give 3
per cent, protection to colonial pro-
duce, and receive about 10 per cent,
protection on British produce in return.
These duties are so arranged that Britain is
to raise £700,000 a year by her preferential
tariff. Australasia, with one-tenth the popu-
lation, is to raise £293,000, or more than
one-third as much, which means that Aus-
tralasia is to contribute more than four times
as much for each inhabitant as Britain does.
India, with about 60 times the population of
Australasia, is to supply £130,000, or less
than half as much in the total, and less than
one-hundredth part as much per inhabitant.
And Canada, with more population than
Australasia, is to supply £137,000 a year, or
about one-third as much per inhabitant as
this country. The aggregate to be raised by
the preferential duties is £1,400,000 a year,
and this amount is to be “ administered ” by
a Council in London, said Council consisting
of the Agents-Gene.ral and the members of
the British Government —the latter consti-
tuting a substantial majority. It is to be
applied, apparently, to defence or other
Imperial purposes, so that the money will
really go to relieve J. Bull of part of his
present expenditure while the colonies are
not relieved of anything.
* * * *
The sum total of this awful proposal, there-
fore, is about as follows : J. Bull is to give
colonial produce protection against foreign
produce in his markets to the extent of 3 per
cent. He is to get protection in colonial
markets to the extent of 10 per cent, in re-
turn. He is to get all the money raised by
both systems of protection, and to do with
it very much as he pleases. The protection
doesn’t cover equal ground in both cases ;
out of 219 articles imported in large quanti-
ties into Great Britain the colonies are to get
no preference whatever on 201, and on the
other 18 are to receive a preference which
won’t make up for the disadvantages under
which Australasia, at all events, labors in
the matter of long and expensive sea-freights.
In return they are to give Britain a large and
solid preference on practically everything,
and give Britain the money raised thereby.
The fact that two eminent and allegedly en-
lightened Britons gave a £5OO prize to the
man who concocted this incredible scheme
implies that they, at least, see nothing un-
reasonable about it, and presumably most
other Britons will view it as more or less
reasonable also. Under these circumstances
the Customs Union is decidedly “off.” As
already mentioned, there are so many differ-
ences in the conditions of Britain and the
other parts of the empire that to arrive at a
basis of union concessions must be made
somewhere. The idea of the Statist prize-
man is that the other parts of the empire
shall make all the concessions, and that
Britain shall receive them and be paid for
receiving them, which about breaks even J,
Bull’s massive record for gall and self-
assertion.
The Moral of Meagher.
N.S.W. Supreme Court has erased from its roll
the name of lawyer Meagiier. Meagher said
he suppressed his knowledge of Dean’s guilt
because it was a confidential communication
from client to solicitor. Presumably, he un-
suppressed his knowledge later on because it
was not a confidential communication from
client to solicitor, or because he came to
the conclusion that a communication from
client to solicitor w-as nothing like as privileged
as he had supposed it to be. As the communi-
cation itself didn’t show any signs of wear and
tear, Meagher’s public confession was prob-
ably due, in part at least, to a glim-
mering of the idea that a lawyer has
no more business to protect a criminal than
has any ordinary citizen. Astounding as it may
appear, this idea is perfectly correct. In fact,
a lawyer has rather less business to shield crime
than an ordinary citizen, because he is officially
supposed to be an instrument in the country’s
scheme for securing justice. He is “a member
of the Court ” ; and it is because he is a mem-
ber of the Court, and a wheel in the justice-
machine, that he is segregated from the com-
munity generally, and his profession is called
“honourable” and is closely guarded from
assault and intrusion, and he is allowed numer-
ous class privileges and advantages. There-
fore, there is a special obligation on a lawyer to
right wrong, and to clear the innocent, and to
bring the guilty to justice ; and this obligation
is still theoretically acknowledged from the
bench.
* * * *
In practice, however, the monstrous conven-
tion has been qucm-established that a lawyer
has a right to defend for a fee a person whom
he knows to be guilty, and not only to urge the
circumstances in extenuation of his guilt, but
to suppress his guilt, to deceive the Court into
a belief in his innocence—thus often throwing
the odium of guilt upon an innocent person —
and to bring public justice to nought.
That is to say, that while it is held
a disgraceful thing for a private citizen to
tell a lie, even with a good object, a lawyer
may lie openly, unblushingly, without disgrace,
even with honor, for the object of protecting a
guilty person from the community’s justice ;
that while it is a wrong thing and criminal for
a private citizen to perjure himself, like John-
son, in a court of justice—if Johnson did
perjure himself —even to secure those nearest
and dearest to him from the machinations of a
scoundrel, it is not wrong and not criminal for
a lawyer, who is specially sworn to uphold
justice, to sell his conscience for money, and
perjure himself brazenly, deliberately, per-
sistently, to advance the machinations
of a similar scoundrel; that, while it is a
private citizen’s duty not only to refrain from
committing crime or assisting the criminal, but
to denounce crime and do his utmost to bring
the criminal to justice, it is a lawyer’s privilege
to conceal his knowledge of crime, to aid and
abet the criminal, to impute falsehood to wit-
nesses whom he knows to be truthful, to im-
pute guilt to persons whom he knows to be
innocent, to do his utmost to hoodwink the
Judge, and to cheat the jury, and to clothe his
client-wolf in sheep’s clothing, and send him
forth “ without a stain on his character,” en-
couraged to commit fresh crimes by the know-
ledge that those crimes will similarly be dis-
guised, and compounded, and defended—for a
fee —by such an honorable member of “the
honorable profession ” of the Law.
* * * *
The bench, as has been said, denies the
validity of this convention; public opirion
revolts from it; yet nevertheless it exists, and
—as the excuses offered on behalf of Rofe and
Meagher more or less testify—there is a con-
tinual effort on the part of many members of
the legal profession to extend its influence and
acceptance. How many barristers take the
stand of Abraham Lincoln, and refuse to sup-
port a case unless convinced of the client’s
innocence or right ? How many would refuse
to urge a “Not Guilty” plea on behalf of a
felon whom they knew to be guilty, if the
brief was accompanied by a thumping re-
tainer? The Bulletin has had a pretty large
experience of lawyers, and it doubts if it could
find one unable to compound with his scruples
if only the retainer were big enough. Yet a
lawyer who consciously endeavors to aid a felon
to escape from justice is obviously an accessory
to his crime : if the felon does escape the lawyer
is an accessory to any crimes he may commit
thereafter; and the law rightly holds that
criminal and accessory are equally, or almost
equally, guilty. But who talks of giving a law-
yer ten years’ penal servitude when he aids a
murderer, whom he knows to be a murderer, to
save his neck or his liberty ?
* * * *
Yet even a guilty person, it is urged, has a
right to have every possible extenuating cir-
cumstance put forward in his favor. He lias ;
and the lawyer who knows his client’s guilt
may extenuate it, but can never have the right
to conceal it. Whatever his obligation to his
client, his obligation to the community is para-
mount. This is a dogmatic solution of the
ethical problem, but, if the community is to
continue, no other solution is possible. It is
true that, ethically, a man may do as he pleases.
He is under no obligation to accept majority-
standards in framing which he has not been
consulted, and which he finds it inconvenient
or irrational to observe. In the last logical
resort, he must be his own ethics-artificer. Yet
a man may not do as he pleases. Civilisation
only becomes possible by the surrender of a
portion of the rights of each for the benefit of
all. A modern community tramples many in-
dividual rights under foot—unjustly, from the
individual’s point of view ; but the only alter-
native is that the community shall itself be
trampled under foot. In the last practical ie-
sort, the community must fix the etluca
standards of the individuals who compose it.
Thus the benefit of the community is th®
final test to which the Meagher case and a


similar cases must be brought. It is to the
common standards of right and wrong that,
consciously or unconsciously, we all argue and
refer. Doubtless the community-standards are
often wrong, but as a body they represent the
best results of the experience of humanity,
and in the main they are profitable to the
greatest number of individuals. And the
lawyer, as an officer of the community, sworn
to secure its justice, is of all persons the one to
whom we look for observance of its standards.
The doctor and the priest are frequently placed
in- the lawyer’s predicament of being divided
between opposing interests and claims, aud
their position is the more difficult because more
often they have to weigh the rights of one in-
dividual against another, when only circum-
stances can guide the judgment. Where the
rights of the individual conflict with those of
the community, doctor and priest are bound
equally with the lawyer at all costs to consider
the community first. In the case, for example,
set by the Australasian Medical Gazette :
Should a doctor, under any circumstances, dis-
close the confidences of his patient ? the answer
is “ Yes, if the benefit of the community re-
quires it.” A doctor called, for example, to
attend in hiding a murderer like Deeming, and
realising whom he had to deal with, should
have no hesitation in delivering him up to
public justice. A doctor in the situation of
Dr. Playfair, discovering from a patient
something which he considers of vital impor-
tance to friend or relation, must act to the best
of his individual judgment. “ Etiquette of
the profession ” has not the paramount claim of
“ benefit of the community,” and in a strife
between the moral claims of individuals there
is not, either in theory or in practice, any obli-
gatory standard to refer to. In all other cases,
the community is bound to insist that the com-
munity comes first and the individual nowhere.
Salus populi suprema lex. And this is the
Moral of Meagher.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Judge Windeyer and the Privy Council.
Judge Windeyer has used the Colonial Office
backstairs to some purpose. S.M. Herald of
June 15 has an inspired paragraph, stating
that he has almost clutched the prize he yearns
for—a judicial seat in the Privy Council. One
thing alone is wanting —Australasia’s approval.
Singularly enough, considering Judge WiN-
deyer’s “ distinguished services,” as apparently
alleged by Premier Reid, Mr. Chamberlain
hesitates. Did the ghosts of Mount Rennie
accompany Judge Windeyer Up those back-
stairs ? Has some rumor reached the far
Antipodes of that hideous travesty of justice,
when, in the closing days of 1886, four youths,
of the average age of 18 years only, were sent to
the hangman, and five to prison for life, chiefly
on the practically unsifted evidence of witnesses
afterwards known as an arsonist and a forger,
for the offence of assaulting a girl of doubtful
character, doubtful in the identification of
her assailants? Did Mr. Chamberlain catch
a whiff of the blood which spurted from the
necks of the gibbeted lads after that mockery
of a trial during which prisoners, lawyers, and
jurymen slept from sheer fatigue—a trial which
W. B. Dalley, formerly Attorney-General of
New South Wales, Minister of the Crown, and
Privy Councillor, compared to such as
“ could only be discovered in some of the darkest pages
of a very dark period of Irish history, when counsel, to
whose hands were committed the lives and liberties of
human beings, appealed in vain to the tribunal for some
consideration, and for some regard for human weakness”—
a trial of which the Sydney Morning Herald,
the leading daily newspaper of New South
Wales, said that —
No case has been heard of in modern times in which
English judges have compelled jurors and counsel in
criminal cases to sit all through the night, in spite of re-
peated protests and requests for adjournment
It may be so : the altar of Mount Rennie still
smokes. But, as Mr. Chamberlain asks Aus-
tralasia’s opinion, Australasia has an easy
answer. We do not desire to be represented
upon the Privy Council at all. The Privy
Council jurisdiction is useless, expensive, ludi-
crous, obnoxious. Nothing but custom can
excuse the gigantic folly of dragging Austral-
asian cases to the other end of the earth for
trial, while suitors and counsel plod wearily
after them. We want Australasian justice
administered in Australasia, where the
facts and conditions are thoroughly known,
where interminable cost and delay can be
avoided. We will do nothing, by making
a quasi-endorsement of the Privy Council’s
authority, to retard the day—now close at
hand—when its jurisdiction over Australasia
shall be swept away altogether. Still less will
we pa> a tuft-liunting Judge a heavy salary to
sit in England and give decisions overturning,
or even criticising, the consensus of Supreme
Court Judges here. And least of all will we
nominate to the Privy Council Judge Win-
deyer, who time and again has, by his unique
method of conducting criminal trials, brought
the administration of alleged justice into naked
contempt, and who, of all Australian Judges
since the convict-days, with a single exception,
has proved himself the unfit test for his high
position, the„one whose acts this country desires
to hurry most quickly into oblivion.
A Divorce-Court Moral.
In a Melbourne divorce-suit last week Chief
Justice Madden laid down the rule that no
married actress can be trusted to preserve her
virtue “on tour” unless accompanied by her
husband. An actress’s husband, it seems, “ is
not to suspect his wife, but he is expected to
realise that if left without him aud the restrain-
ing influences which he could., or ought to,
exercise, she may be too frail for temptation.”
The learned Judge allowed for special induce-
ments to adultery in theatrical life. A grass
widow actress on tour“ ‘ has to travel aboutand
constantly associate by night as Well as'day
with a class of men often attractive, and not
infrequently Jax in. their views of sexual
morality.” It was here that Mr. Madden’s
reasoning proved frail. Society women-Rsso-
ciate by day and night with attractive, immoral
men who are not their husbands, travel much
in their company, and openly flirt with
them. Nevertheless, no Judge has ever
been known to discover the same excuse for
a flighty countess that Mr. Madden found
for the professional lady who went astray.
A noble earl is not considered to “contribute
to his own wrong ” when he allows his wife to
do the Continent in the company of a pleasure-
seeking “set,” or pay a round of visits to
country houses where the most accomplished of
lady-killers abound. An actor is not a more
insidious corrupter of matronly morals than
the average military captain, judging from
divorce-court records, therefore the granting of
a more special travelling allowance to actresses
than to women of another class, exposed to
equally strong temptation, is absurdly illogical,
or distinctly rough on the theatrical profession.
Probably Mr. Madden intended his judgment
to be rough on the profession, although he
didn’t say so. And he was not wrong in this.
Female virtue is chiefly the product of Mrs.
Grundy, and among communities where that
restraining influence is very little respected
or feared, the fair sex is proportionately
careless of its good name. Actors, so
far from being attractive, are posi-
tively repellent, on account of their gay-
Lothario reputation—to women who, as the
saying goes, “respect themselves.” The sup-
posed lax morality of the gaudy gentlemen
debars them from many chances of conquest
which come in the way of the average ware-
houseman, curate, or bank-clerk. Certainly it
had nothing to do with the case that Justice
Madden was discussing. The one powerful
factor in that case, which his Honor over-
looked, was Mrs. Grundy. Had he been deal-
ing with the indiscretion of a Toorak priestess
of fashion he would have granted a decree nisi
to the husband, but the respondent being an
actress the petition was dismissed. Why dis-
guise the truth ?
That Brewery Case.
On Wednesday of last week N.S.W. Assembly
set itself to straggle feebly around the case of
Tooth and Co., the Sydney brewers who were
lately accused of defrauding the revenue, and
after several hours’ straggling left the matter
very much wffiere it was at the beginning. The
present Assembly is a weak affair at the best,
and its utter incapacity to get at the real mean-
ing of anything was painfully apparent on this
occasion. Premier Reid alleged at great length
that the Collector of Customs was a man of un-
blemished character—a fact which nobody had
called in question ; and that it was absurd to
allege—which nobody had alleged—that he
would conspire with any brewery to defraud
the revenue. He also pointed out that it was
proved Tooth and Co. had, in the last four
years, paid duty on every gallon of beer shown
by their books to be sold —though a considerable
sum (,£508) was only paid after an informer had
drawn the department’s attention to certain
serious discrepancies ; which assurance was an-
other matter that had no connection whatever
with the complaint. Minister of Justice Gould
also enthusiastically alleged, when the case was
first mentioned in the Assembly, that Tooth
and Co. had paid to the Customs Department
all the duty owing by them, and that the Cus-
toms officers saw no possible reason to prosecute
because all the duty had been paid, and there
was therefore no grievance whatever. And
Sydney Daily Telegraph, in a leading article,
took up the matter in the same strain :
Two employes of the firm, after leaving its service, made
certain allegations to the effect that it had used means for
fraudulently evading the excise duty. . . . Application
was made for a criminal summons. This the magistrate
declined to issue, for the very good reason that the Cus-
toms Department, against which the fraud was alleged to
have been committed, denied that it had been defrauded.
. . . The Customs Department ought to know its own
business, &c., &c.
All of this is mainly remarkable for the manner
in which it flies off at a tangent and never gets
near the matter really at issue. The accusation
(unheard and, of course, wholly unproved so
far) was that Tooth and Co. had wrongfully
obtained a rebate of duty on a large quantity of
beer which did not go out of the brewery at
all. Therefore, when the Customs Department
declined to prosecute because the firm had paid
full duty on all the beer which did go out, and
Minister Gould indignantly refused to inter-
fere because the duty on the beer which went
out was honorably paid, and Premier Reid
whooped up the same irrelevant and well-worn
assertion, they were all religiously keeping
clear ol the real question. And when the
Daily Telegraph proudly points out that the
Customs Department denied that it was
defrauded it also dodges the fact that the fraud
which the informer said had been committed
and the fraud which the Department, according
to Minister Gould’s explanation in Parliament,
said had not been committed, were two totally
different alleged frauds. And the statement that-
the Customs office “may be expected to know its
own business ”is also wholly irrelevant. The
charge was that the drawback paid on
certain liquors which went bad and
have since been destroyed was wrong-
fully obtained, because some of the liquor
was not locally-manufactured beer. Now
that the liquor in question has disappeared
down the everlasting sink, the Customs de-
partment can’t tell more than any other out-
sider what it consisted of, except by smelling
the entry in the book ; and the persistence with
which all parties keep stating that duty was
paid on all the good liquor which was sold from
the brewery—instead of talking about the bad
liquor which wasn’t sold—is remarkable. And
the whole-souled scorn heaped on the “infor-
mers” by Premier Reid was also somewhat
misplaced, seeing that one of these informers
had so far made out a case of non-payment that
i lie Customs department charged Tooth and
Co. £5OB for three years’ back duty on a
certain line of goods upon his informa-
tion, and Tooth and Co. paid the ,£5OB
—“under protest.” But they did pay it,
and it does not appear to be on record, so far,
that they have had it refunded. When one
case was so good as all-this, the flat, refusal, of
the Government to even talk about the other
looks ridiculous. In the interests both of the
public aiid of Tooth and Co. the case should
be publicly heard in the police-court, and the
evidence fully reported in the press.
The N.S.W. Protectionist Party.
E. W. O’Sullivan, M.L.A., writes as follows: —
Dear Bulletin,— From time to time I notice in your
journal paragraphs and articles adverse to the Protec-
tionist-party of N.S. Wales. This is all the more
remarkable, considering the stand The Bulletin has
always taken with regard to Protection. Of course, I am
well aware that, while advocating protective views, you
are also in the advance guard of rational Radicalism, and
the gist of your complaints against the Protectionists of
New South Wales appears to be that, while standing up
for Australian industries, we are not abreast of the times
with regard to other progressive views.
But where, may I ask, is your warrant for the implica-
tion ? If you will run your memory back for about
10 years, you will find that almost every progressive
idea which is now before the public, or has been
legislated upon during the period referred to, has
emanated from men with protective views. For ex-
ample, it was Mr. Dibbs, a Protectionist afterwards,
who stopped the wholesale sacrifice of the public lands by
auction. In 1886 I introduced the Workshops and Fac-
tories Bill, and Dr. Renwick afterwards took up the matter
and passed it through the Legislative Assembly He was
then Minister for Education in a Government in which
were Messrs. Dibbs, Lyne, Copeland, Garvan, Suttor,
and Fletcher— all prominent Protectionists. It was a
Protectionist Ministry, led by Mr. Dibbs, which placed the
great democratic principle of “ one-man-one-vote ” upon
the statute-book, and the agitation for that law was
initiated by another Protectionist, Mr. W. H. Traill.
That Ministry also initiated the Courts of Conciliation
and Arbitration, and assisted in the passage of the Land
Boilers Bill, the extension of the Employers’ Liability
Bill to seamen, and other industrial reforms, through the
Lower House. It was the Dibbs Government that first
took up the question of retrenchment (as an adminis-
tration) after that matter and military reform had been
initiated by myself. It was a Protectionist, Mr.
Heydon, who first brought the subject of Payment
of Members before the Legislative Assembly ; and the Pro-
tectionist-party, almost to a man, supported this other
great democratic principle from start to finish. It was
Mr. W. F. Schey, a Protectionist, who introduced the
Eight Hours Bill, still before the House. Messrs. Rose,
Dowell, Walker, J. D. Fitzgerald, Gough, and O’Sulli-
van, all Protectionists, were the members who investi-
gated the proposal for a national bank, and drew up a re-
port in favor of the amalgamation of the two savings
banks as a preliminary to the establishment of such an
institution. I was the member who broached the ques-
tion of the Credit Fonder system, as well as the reduc-
tion of the charge upon selections from one shilling
to sixpence per acre, and the ring-fence around family
selections. Mr. Crick first introduced the Anti-Alien
Bill, and Mr. Willis the amendment of the Masters
and Servants Act. The Art Gallery, Public Library and
Museum were opened to the public on Sundays by Mr.
Copeland ; the village settlements were established by
the same gentleman ; mining on private property was
also legalised by him. The Agreements Validating Bill
and the Conspiracy Laws Abolition Bill came from Mr.
Willis ; the Homes Protective Bill from Mr. O’Sullivan,
and the Betterment Bill from Mr. Lyne. The Land and
Income taxes were first introduced by a Government of
which Messrs. Dibbs, Copeland, Lyne, Sutton, Fletcher
and Garvan were members. Mostly the Protectionists
have been supporters of womanhood suffrage and the
referendum. Federation was advocated by the Protec-
tionists when it was opposed by Freetraders like Messrs.
Parkes, Robertson, Reid and Want. With but one
exception, the Protectionists are in favor of a reform of
the Upper House, and their leader (Mr. Lyne) has never
linked himself with the Tory element in that Cham-
ber, but has always expressed himself as being in
favor of a reasonable alteration in the constitution of
the Legislative Council. The foregoing are but a few of
the democratic and progressive ideas ventilated by the
Protectionists of New South Wales, and it follows then
that, if they came into power, their policy would be based
upon progressive lines. It is a matter of comment among
members of the present Legislative Assembly that nearly
all the practical amendments and suggestions made there
come from the Protectionists. What I have said from
start to finish in this paragraph is merely a statement of
fact, which can be borne out by a reference to the files of
Hansard. It is because the Freetrade organs do not do
us justice in their reports that these facts are not gener-
ally known to the public of New South Wales. In a recent
leading article you were somewhat harsh in your treat-
ment of Messrs. Lyne and Copeland. It was the former
who gave the pipe contract to a N.S.W. industry,
and on every occasion when he was a Minister he en-
deavored to restrict contracts for Government work to
our own people. Mr. Copeland was the man who raised
the wages of the railway workmen, and he introduced the
proposal for the establishment of Government factories
for the manufacture of boots and clothing. Most of the
good point* about the Land Act of Mr. Carruthers also
emanated from him, for it is well known that Mr. Cope-
land had drafted a large portion of the measure before he
left office in 1894. The fact that members of an Adminis-
tration of which Mr. Lyne was a member had friends and
sympathisers in the Legislativ e Council does not imply
that Mr. Lyne is a Tory, and I think when the crisis comes
between the two Houses —as come it must—you will be
convinced of that fact.
I trust that you will publish this letter, in order that
your fellow Protectionists may not be misunderstood. It
is bad enough to be attacked by the Freetrade press, and
to have our speeches abbreviated in a ridiculous fashion
by that section of journalism, but when one of our
strongest champions unwillingly misrepresents us the
Protectionists may well wrap their mantles around them
and exclaim, “You, too, Brutus !”
Victoria’s Latest Deficit.
The new Victorian deficit, which has oeen
arrived at despite a long spell of the hardest
economy on record, makes it practically certain
that more taxation—a lot more taxation, in
fact—will have to be resorted to. Victoria is
now in the position to which all the Australias
must come sooner or later. The difference
between public solvency and insolvency in this
country depends almost wholly on the land
revenue, and Victoria, as by far the smallest
province hi Australia, has got practically to the
end of ita land revenue before any of the others.
The piibljc revenue from this source now aver-
ages about 7s. per inhabitant per annum,
against £\ 16s. in New South Wales, and
£1 7s. in Queensland. If all three pro-
vinces simultaneously stopped living on their
capital in the shape of the public estate, and
devoted the land revenue to public works pur-
poses, Or to the reduction of their debt, they
would all be, so far as current expenditure is
concerned, about equally insolvent. Therefore
it follows, if the present methods continue,
that they are likely to be all about equally
insolvent by-and-bye. There is no visible road
out of this position, except by raising more
revenue, by means of more taxation. Retrench-
ment in Victoria has got down to very nearly
the vanishing point, and, as it is impossible to
sell Jlte public lands again and have the good
old days twice over, the cold, hard expedient of
.grinding more money out of the community is the
only thing left. Maoriland, in the same situation,
struggled out of the slough of bankruptcy by
levying taxation to the extent of .£3 16s. 7d.
yearly for each inhabitant, against about £2 Bs.
in Victoria and a little less in N.S. Wales ; and
all the care and economy of the Governments
which have held office at Wellington since 1890
wouldn’t have filled the gap otherwise. Vic-
toria has now brought up short against the
same fact which Maoriland struck a good many
years ago. The only means by which a country
can be kept solvent are by wise and careful ad-
ministration, and by raising sufficient revenue,,
in the least burdensome way possible, to pay
all necessary expenses, and enough over to
cover public works expenditure. The latter
item represents the much-vaunted virtue of
Thrift in its most beautiful form, and as such
it should commend itself to all consistent Tories
—who, strangely enough, have hitherto proved
the chief obstacles in the way of any move-
ment in the right direction. Thrift in an indi-
vidual consists mostly in accumulating wealth
for his old age. Thrift in a nation also consists
in accumulating wealth for its old age—when
its goldfields are exhausted, and its public lands
are mostly sold, and the whoop and dazzle of
its early riotous days is over, and it has become
a common, ordinary country which lives, like
other old countries, on raising vegetables and
making heavy iron things in ugly factories, and
digging prosaic coal out of the bowels of
the earth. Australia has hitherto had a
vague idea that it would keep young for
ever, and that because it had lived to a
great extent in the past by selling its assets
in the shape of the public estate, it could
live that way all the days of its life. Also, it
suffers from a vague impression that it is a
heavily-taxed community which it isn’t,
though it is certainly going to be in the future,
if the public Treasury is to keep its head above
water. The cold reality of things as they are
going to be is represented by that £3 16s. 7d.
per head of annual taxation in Maoriland —
which badly wants to be raised to £4 per head
to give the Public Works Department a fair
show and to stop the still-continuous increase
of the public debt. And the one visible road
out of Victoria’s difficulties is to consider ways
and means for levying an average of 10s. or 15s.
per annum more taxation for each inhabitant.
If there is any other mode of meeting the diffi-
culty it isn’t apparent up to date.
The Ways of the Detective.
The methods of the Australian detectives led
Judge Hodges, of Victoria, to make some un-
usually straight remarks to two members of the
force the other day. The case in question was
the one known as the Canadian murder. At a
little straggling settlement near Ballarat a
woman was found hacked to death in her own
back-yard, and, in the absence of any huge
footprints leading from the spot to the residence
of some person with bloodstains on him, the
detectives arrested the two nearest residents, a
pair of old women, one of them practically
crazy. The sane old woman speedily proved
an alibi, and the case against her had to be
dropped. The ot her one hadn’t enough intellect
left to know an alibi when she saw it, so she
remained in prison. In the absence of any
shred of direct evidence against her, two
above - mentioned detectives seem to have
struck the great idea of making her sup-
ply testimony against herself, and as they
couldn’t get at her in gaol, where she wasawait-
ing trial, one of them laid a charge of vagrancy
against her, and arrested her in prison for hav-
ing no visible means of support, and hauled her
away to court nominally t» answer the charge.
Then, having got her to themselves, the crazed
old female was secretly cross-examined for an
hour or more, presumably with a view to get-
ting evidence which might hang her later on,
but failing to extract anything the charge of
vagrancy was dropped. The murder charge
also came to nothing, and the whole unscru-
pulous muddle fell to pieces. The incident
throws a lot of light on the ways of the detec-
tive. The old woman wasn’t a vagrant —she
had a fixed residence and ,£6O was found in her
possession when she w’as arrested—therefore
the detectives brought a glaringly false accusa-
tion against her to suit their own purposes, and
if that isn’t perjury it ought to be. Also, they
apparently didn’t stick at trying to hang a
deranged old woman on evidence extracted
from herself in a manner which is, or ought to
be, wholly illegal. Their defence was that they
hoped the woman would “ establish her
innocence ” under cross-examination, which
was a tolerably “steep” narrative. Her
innocence didn’t need establishing, in the
first place, there being nothing at all
against her ; and, in the second place, the ’tec
who is trying desperately to establish a
prisoner’s guilt and who holds a brief for the
prosecution, is a promising individual to estab
lish her innocence by secret examination. It
would be interesting to know the processes
adopted to obtain evidence at that secret exam.
Were they simply verbal, or was it found need-
ful to shake the aged prisoner in order to
extract information from her, and, if so, was it
necessary to shake her hard, or did the D. feel
called upon to stand upon her corn to overcome
her reticence, or how did things go? There are
so many possibilities about this kind of private
examination that these inquiries are less irrele
vant than they might appear. And if this sort
of thing is done in a city like Ballarat, how
does the ’tec run riot on the far outskirts of
civilisation where the public eye isn’t upon him ?
“ Well-out-of-it ” to The Bulletin :
There was reason to hope that the old abuses re pay-
ment of N.S.W. State-school teachers, viz., payment
according- to classification of the school, to the fluctuation
of attendance therein, to condition (married or single), to
sex—matters over which the teachers have no control —
would have been rectified by the Public Service Commis-
sioners and the only just form of payment introduced, viz. ,
by personal merit judged by the teachers’ certificates and
the result of their school examinations, but the old abuses
have only been aggravated. Thus in the highlands, where
life in winter is one perpetual shiver, a few days heavy
rain or a snow-storm causes a low average attendance for
the quarter, and the teachers’ salaries suffer probably for
the next year. Truly a dispensation of Providence ! And
how tempting to a teacher to put a few criss-crosses in his
roll-book to escape such a dispensation? Then, again,
the married men receive “quarters,” or £7O, £6O, etc.,
per annum more than a single man. Is it because the
married man is really worth so much more than his single
brother? Then there is the sex question. To be a female
is a serious sin, severely punished by the Commissioners.
The crime of being a married female is quite too heinous
to be mentioned. I would advise ambitious girls, before
entering the service, to don pants ; the Commissioners
pay a high price for trousers, irrespective of the- work
their wearers accomplish. There is one odd piece of jus-
tice in the salaries. Ex pupil-teachers, male and female,-
are to be paid alike till they gain classifications. Why c.
The married men have a grievance all to themselves
They are to be charged £7O, £6O, &c., for rent of “ quar-
ters.” Many of these quarters in country parts are mere
rookeries, hardly worth £l2 a year. Why should a poor
civil slave be compelled to pay 1 60 for the Government-
tenement, when he can rent a better house foe, perhaps
£lO or £l5 a year ? It would pay some of them to set fire-
sticks in the former as soon as convenient. The new
arrangements offer a premium to trickery, and tend to
stultify merit and honest work.

George Darrell arose on the horizon at
Her Majesty’s last Saturday, when the “ Sunny
South ” was revived for the one-hundredth-and-
blankth time before a larger audience than H.M.’s
has seen for a long while past. Audiences have
been so thin at the big theatre in these recent
disastrous days that even the large policeman that
comes round to summon the management for over-
crowding felt that he was a satire on himself, so
Saturday’s resurrection was a joyful change, which
may or may not last. The “ Sunny South ”is an
interesting study nowadays. It is growing archaic.
Anyone who sees it now, and remembers how it
looked on its first appearance, can feel that this
country has changed a lot since Darrell's drama
was first written. People don’t talk about Aus-
tralia as the Sunny South so much as they
did. They used to call it so because it
was south of England ; now a new, un-English
generation doesn’t care a straw whether it is south
of England or not. Australia was south of Eng-
land to the old generation; to the new one England
has the dashed impertinence to be north of Aus-
tralia. Also, at the time Darrell wrote, the digger
and the bushranger were the beginning, middle,
and end of Australian romance ; the big, hulking
nugget and the “ claim ” were the centre of Aus-
tralian literature ; and local coloring consisted of
the glaring red shirt of Bill or Jim. Now the
nugget is practically extinct; and the digger’s shirt
is any color he can get; and the claim is down
2176 ft., so that the limited liability co. has to let
Bill down by machinery ; and Jim is floating wild
cats in London. No one writes dranas like the
“Sunny South ” now, or feels like them either, and
the sight of it is like a pleasant whiff of a past that
has been outlived very suddenly.
* * ♦ *
Darrell’s drama, at its worst, is about as
good as the average melo-howl, and the proceed-
ings are not more wildly impossible than usual,
and Darrell, as the hero, doesn’t spread his legs
and wave his revolver in the free atmosphere of
Australia any more than the ordinary hero. The
drama is lavishly staged, too, and sundry
respectable performers—notably, Misses Gladys
Leigh, Wilde and Edith Barrow, Harry Leston,
Robert Inman, Hodson and Charles Hall—sup-
port the noble-souled G.D. to some good purpose.
The story being as badly tangled up as the
average, The Bulletin doesn’t profess to be
quite certain which is Miss Wilde and which is
Inman, but these are mere details. The general
whoop and bellow and glare are all there, and
there are a number of large wild Australian effects
which are calculated to make the kangaroo collect
his tail in affright and never stop running till he
gets to Thargomindah.

The Brough-Boucicault co. filled in two
nights this week with the ever-amusing “ Pass-
port,” and, while the co. in general shone as much
as usual, Majeroni, as the stupendous Russian
policeman, filled his part even better than afore-
time. Majeroni’s vast figure (he is so tall that he
has to ta,ke a week off to see to the top of himself)
fits in with any kind of uniform, and he is de slop-
ing into a very good actor with many different kinds
of broken English at command. The co. afterwards
took another turn at “Mrs. Tanqueray,” and the
last three nights of the season—Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday—are allotted for one-night outbreaks
of “The Idler,” “The Magistrate,” and “The
Amazons” respectively. The last is for Bouci-
cault’s farewell benefit, and a week ago d.c. seats
for this event were already unattainable, and stalls
were almost as scarce as ripe corn on a gallows.
Next Monday the Brough comedy co. starts for
Queensland, and there will be only one B. in this
favorite combination for the future.

The “ Trilby ” season at Sydney Lyceum
is to last till Friday of next week, and on Satur-
day (27th) Hoyt’s company opens in “ A Trip to
Chinatown.” At the Royal “The Derby Winner”
is still doing sufficiently good business to justify
its continuance, and no change is announced up to
date.

On Saturday night a new performer, one
William Gill, made his appearance at Sydney
Tivoli. He did not appear on the programme in
the usual way, but fell out of the gallery on top of
a poor fellow named Alfred Neander, whose back
was broken by the concussion, and who, as this is
written, lies dying in the hospital. Charles Cogill
has joined the Rickards Co., and this rich and
mellow comedian takes well as usual. Godfrey,
at time of writing, was doing his last week.
Altogether, the Tivoli programme has been more
varied than usual.
*****
A lot of shows are finishing, or have just
finished, their career in Sydney—for the present.
The Fitzgeralds propose to pack up their large
and deserving circus at the end of the week.
Friday’s show will be for the benefit of the
Benevolent Asylum, and practical charity calls
on the public to roll up and support Mahomet and
the lady who falls from the roof all it can. That
brilliant orator, the Rev. Charles Clark, has
finished his series of lectures—unless he decides,
after this gets into print, to himself for a
night or two longer. Parson Haskett Smith, the
man who discourses upon “the East” as one
having authority, is advertised to lecture on
“ Jerusalem ” at the Cyclorama for the last time
to-night (Thursday), and his final departure is
shortly expected. Also Kennedy, the fat show-
man with the stony eye and the great circum-
ference, has raised hopes that he will soon close up
his candle-and-grease-eating competition at the
Protestant Hall, and cease to run pins into his
more or less hypnotised “ subject,” and roll him-
self laboriously over the edge of the horizon in an
eastward direction.

A musical season begins at Sydney Cen-
tenary Hall next Wednesday, when the English
Concert Co. makes its first appearance. The
stars of this combination are Misses Thudichum
and Marian M‘Kenzie, Edward Branscombe and
Douglas Powell. Miss Thudichum’s photo,
dosn’t look at all like her name, (pronounced
“ Toodikum ”) and all four singers come here with
a long list of favorable British notices to back up
their pretensions.

“ As You Like It,” at Melb. Princess’s, is
neither a definite success nor a distinct failure,
financially. Neglected by the great bulk of frivol-
ous playgoers, it appeals to that gloomsome section
of humanity which never attends a theatre unless
Immortal William be laid on. Last Saturday
there was a morning service of Shakespeare,
whereat the saints mustered in such goodly force
that the sinners, professional and otherwise, cast
furtive, uncomfortable glances at their neighbors,
as though they had got into a place of worship
by mistake. These brief seasons of “legitimate”
drama, The Bulletin fancies, ought to be con-
ducted by R. S. Smythe, who is more identified
with true religion than are W. and M., and better
calculated to boom devotion to the Bard Divine.
“ As You Like It ” is under the patronage of the
Nonconformist Conscience.
* * * *
Gazing through the glamour of Mrs.
Potter’s Rosalind, one finds very little persuasive-
ness in the lady’s histrionic art. Mrs. Potter
seems charmingly absurd, not to say winsomely
preposterous, for the most part. She elocutes
affectedly, yet without a settled policy of speech,
such as the old-school declaimers brought to bear
upon their patient audience. She ranges from a
golden drone to a silvery gabble when there is no
conceivable cause for going to extremes either
way. But the fact that nobody cares to “guy”
Mrs. Potter’s eccentricities speaks for itself. She
is fascinating, also very much in earnest, and fas-
cinating earnestness strikes the scoffer dumb,
otherwise she would soon be up a tree
in the Forest of Arden. The idea of
several sane people (including a Dresden china
shepherdess) accepting this kitteney Rosalind, this
intensely feminine vision in a fantastic costume,
as anything other than a girl is against all reason.
Her sex flaunts itself. She mocks at her own
assumption of manhood with every trick of her
oval eyes and shake of her bonnie back-hair. In
short, Mrs. Potter’s performance is mainly an
audacious burlesque of W. Shakespeare’s inten-
tion, unless all the rest of the world has been m;s-
taking the late poet’s intention for ages past. The
secrets of William’s works die vvith him, of course.
Maybe he was merely poking borak at the future
generations which were going to take his plots
seriously. We don’t know.

Kyrle Bellew confines himself, as of yore,
to an imitation of Irving’s mannerisms—-in fila-
gree. He never loses consciousness of his elegant
stage appearance, or forgets to bring it right under
public notice, and this journal—remembering how
many fat, ill-favored, unintelligent politicians live
by striking abominable attitudes on every plat-
form where they can get a footing—has no
complaint against Bellew. Nature has made
nim up for sentimental-lover characters, and
he acts accordingly, likewise cleverly. He
is a thing of beauty in the first place, and
an actor afterwards, and notwithstanding that
he sighs to excess, and lays on the tenderness
with an electro-plated trowel, so to speak, there is
often a touch of sincerity in the pretty picture.
The Celia of Miss Lynda Raymond, who is. excep-
tionally natural, deserves much praise, and the
musical foresters, especially the lady soloist, can
be commended for having got into tune since the
first night.

For Saturday the French revolutionary
play of “ Charlotte Corday ” is announced, and a
rush to behold Mrs. Potter in her said-to-be best
character is likely to ensue.

The last nights of “Silver King,” at the
Royal, were marked by a rapid improvement in
King Hedley and Stirling Whyte, the new Denver
and Jaikes, and so the finish of this capital show
was equal to its commencement in all respects.
“ Silver King ” might as well have stayed for the
remaining nights of manager Westmacott’s season,
in the interests of melodramatic art as well as for
the sake of a few people who have grown to love
Bodger, the baker. Bodger aforesaid never
becomes visible in the flesh, but spiritually he is
the livest man in the play, and his squint is every-
where regarded as an absolute fact. “ The Points-
man,” which was to succeed “Silver King” on
Wednesday, can only run nine nights. After
which Maggie Moore and a burlesque of “Trilby.”

The unerring vigor of the Frantz Family
acrobats has carried Melbourne by storm, and
the Opera House is crowded every time. An in-
evitable question re the female element in
this galaxy of skill and muscle is whispered
in sundry places, but doubters can take
it for granted that the three active and
intelligent amazons are as genuine as they appear.
They are even said to be three bona-fide sisters, the
terribly strong one having given herself in mar-
riage to the well-balanced gentleman who asserts
his sovereignty by standing on her head.

A Trebelli matinee at Melb. Town Hall
last Saturday was so joyfully received that the
“star ” undertook to farewell yet once again on
Monday of this week—ere leaving for Sydney.
Mdlle. Trebelli’s visit proved a thorn in the flesh
of the opposition “ New English Concert Com-
pany,” a quartette of pleasing singers who have
found the Hall much too large for their reputation.
The N.E.C.C. comprises a dashing, resonant bari-
tone (Douglas Powell), a light contralto (Miss
Marian M’Kenzie), a shrilly-sweet soprano, and a
modest tenor. Collectively they give satisfaction,
but their season pines for the want of the one pre-
eminent warble which alone can draw the public
in these times of trouble.

A series of performances in aid of Jewish
charities starts at Melbourne Bijou next Saturday.
The Vic. Amateur-4)peratic Society will lead off
with Strauss’s opera-comique “ Die Eledermaus,”
which is to be repeated on Tuesday and Thursday;
and another outbreak of “Pinafore,” also “Two
Roses” and an Italian operetta, will follow in due
course, as per programme.
At Poverty Point.
One of Mrs. Potter’s devices for concealing her —er—
limb-deficiency in Rosalind’s male-attire is a strange, un-
tidy effect, as of stocking coming down. This, together
with the vague grotesqueness of her shaggy coat—it can’t
be called a doublet - gives away the fact that the slender
lady is trying to hide her natural disqualifications for the
part. And yet Mrs. Potter is a very successful Rosalind
at times, even in the Forest of Arden. The soul is
mightier than the leg.
Paradis: “ Mrs. Potter reminds you of the shilling-
table at Foy and Gibson’s —a scrap of gorgeous old brown
lace, a tag of rich purple velvet, a bit of fichu, a morsel of
guipure, an edge of a foulard, a snip off a bridal-veil, a
fragment of chiffon, all the thousand and one trifles so
alluring to the kleptomaniac, but you couldn’t make
the shilling-table into one whole of anything. She
is one of the paintings of Mieris, of yore, or
Carolus Duran of to-day, called the ‘ Portrait of a
Lady.’ A vague, blank impossibility, of lovely combina-
tion in glints, picked, on the Albert Durer system, from
every rainbow dab of the palette. Take a woman of
Millais, and you see at least a glorified reality. However,
Mieris is ever moist, a tempting peach to the bite, and so
is Cora Urquhart Potter, a damson jam-pot, in blue
bric-a-brac.”
Paradis: “ Bellew mellows into a good sort of actor,
though, as with Rignold, the bloom, gloss, and aroma,
which enchanted the New York ladies, are gone for ever.
Rignold’s Claude Melnotte, and Bellew’s Romeo, with
Harry Montague in something else, are the unapproach-
able traditions of the N. Y. matinees, almost reaching the
dignity of lectures to Women Only, with the circles
crammed in proud flesh. What a tittupy throng, at the
stage door, to see Bellew drive off, all furred, in the dash-
ing britska he then sported ! He is sacrificed, nowadays,
to Mrs. P., who obviously directs the repertory, and
Bellew only plays up.”
The “Ben Bolt” tableau in “Trilby” is about the
most natural and best-sustained silent effect ever staged.
Intensely dramatic, yet quite unforced, it carries the
story along for fully two minutes without a word or
gesture. Ordinarily, the song or instrumental music
heard from behind the scenes has no real connection with
the play, or, in any case, it seems to be introduced for the
sake of effect. The song in “Trilby” comes straight
from the soul of the plot, and reveals the pathos of the
tableau which it creates. That is to say, reveals and
appeals to intelligent persons among the audience. About
one person in every 20 has a proper sense of the situation
in all its bearings. The other 19 are merelj’ conscious of
what they hear and see—the voice of an unseen singer,
and four motionless figures on the stage. If the song
were “ Sweet Marie,” and the stage were deserted in the
meantime, they would be quite as much impressed.
On their first Sunday in Melbourne this trip Rosalind
Potter and Orlando Bellew spent the afternoon out-of-
doors—she, with a female attendant, driving a dog-cart,
and he beside her on a bike.
“ Acomparison of Mrs. Brown-Potter’s Rosalind with that
of Mrs. Langtry,” writes a Melb. lady to The Bulletin,
“is all to the advantage of the latter. Both are beautiful
women, but one remembers the Jersey Liiy as not only a
lovely but a satisfactory Rosalind. One example comes to
mind, showing the artistic difference of the two women’s
performances. In the passage with Orlando, in which
Rosalind, in her boy’s clothes, speaks of dwelling ‘ here
in the skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat,’
Mrs. Langtry used to suddenly remember her lack of
skirts, and, glancing down, coyly draw her cloak around
her legs with a very pretty affectation of sudden shyness.
Mrs. Potter sees no such chance in the words. She just
spreads out her arms and indicates “ the skirts of the
forest ’in a general sort of way. Yet such touches reveal
the actress—or the artist.” Which is certainly the first
time Tiie Bulletin ever heard Mrs. Langtry accused of
being an artist, even comparatively speaking.
Mrs. Brown-Potter, in her latest gown (by Worth, of
Paris) as represented in Melbourne weeklies, bears a
startling resemblance to a half-peeled banana.
Brown-Potter on the stage is a constant reminder of
David Copperfield’s Aunt yelling at Uriah Heep : “ For
heaven’s sake ! man, don’t be galvanic.” Potter is gal-
vanic and angular, all knees and elbows, she prances
through her part like a plucked crane, and yet she has an
undeniable charm, and most men would be eontent to be
clay in the hands of the Potter.
S.S. : “Bellew as Orlando gives me the impression of
never forgetting his legs ; everything in the character is
made subordinate to those slim, ineffable legs. Even the
beauteous Potter herself is sacrificed before the gilded
calves as they wriggle and posture and fairly bellow for

divine Rosalind in the gorgeous diction of the poet of
poets, he deludes nobody ; it is obvious to the meanest
understanding that he is thinking of his legs all the time
and striving with great cunning to display them to the
best advantage. I am convinced that if Bellew’s legs
were cut off short at the butts he would make an excellent
actor on the stumps, but he will never be a convincing
pro. whilst he has a leg to stand upon.”
il . Ch rl® f ', Justice Madden’s refusal to decree a divorce in
the Richardson case on the ground that Richardson had
allowed his vocalist wife to take engagements and travel
about with theatrical companies on her own account, is
although novel in Australia, strictly in accord with divorce-
court practice in France. Again, which is another side
ot the same question, a man can divorce his wife in France
if she goes on any theatrical stage against his will.

The commonest form of tarradiddle that gets into news-

a man at arm’s length above her head. The whole stage

New York Dramatic Mirror upon Miss Olga Nether-
sole’s osculatory effects: —“ The length to which the
actress went in depicting the passion Carmen is supposed
to feel for her various lovers approached in some instances
the ridiculous, and was the cause of considerable laughter
In view’ of the number and duration of the kisses she
bestows, it is not hard to understand why the three men
who impersonate the parts of her lovers have clean-shaven
upper-lips. An ordinary moustache subject to such
treatment would soon be reduced to a shapeless hirsute
mass. It is no exaggeration to assert that if Miss Nether-
sole were to reduce the duration of her kisses one-half
the performance would be over considerably more than a
half-hour before midnight.”

Leumane was not wattle-farming all the days of his re-

commercial-minded tenor sold at a good profit. Since his
return to the comic-opera business, Leumane is dieting
himself for the sake of his stage outline, and before leav-

Apropos Judge Madden’s refusal to grant a man a
divorce because he had contributed to his wife’s fall by
allowing her to travel with persons of loose morals (to
wit, the males of a variety-co.) thus Sydney D.T. “ Put
it the other way sexually, and substitute man for woman.
Suppose a wife sued for divorce and the husband pleaded
that he hadn’t been all he should be because he had to
earn his living by theatrical work, consequently was
forced into association with people who were attractive
personally, but exceedingly weak as to morals. That man
would be beaten at the trial. The Judge would take the
opportunity to make scathing remarks about his brutal
infidelity to his wife, and still more brutal excuse for it.
Yet it’s precisely the same case as the one tried at Mel-
bourne. There is only one way of justifying the court’s
decision, which is by assuming that woman is weaker in-
tellectually than man—so much weaker that it would be a
mistake to give her the franchise.”

The N.S.W. Civil Service is a very nervous
combination just now. Every second man has a
dreadful cold on the chest caught through waiting
outside the Government Printing-office on damp
evenings to get the very first number of the
Gazette with his retrenchment notice in it; and
the rest have snuffles in the head through being
wakened by the casual goat in the yard at 2 a.m.
and rushing down under the impression that it
was the Government come to raise their salaries.
The Commissioners’ unfortunate reputation for
industry is partly the cause of this ; they are com-
monly supposed to work night and day, and until
the numbers are really up no man knows whether
he won’t be promoted suddenly at midnight, or
retrenched at 1 a.m., or have his salary raised
about 4.30 in the morning. The excitement is
something awful, and the Service has got the
jumps so badly that it can’t even shave itself with
safety.
The only point of value in connection with

say that the Premier paid all his own expenses out
of his private purse.) When Jacob Garrard
tripped to Maoriland a question like this was
asked, but was diplomatically postponed and sub-
sequently dropped.

The English, Scottish and Australian bank’s
second reconstruction scheme—which in its original shape
was about the most superlatively cheekv thing in the
reconstruction line—is now put before the creditors in a
very much modified form. According to this latest pro-
posal, 40 per cent. (£356,582) out of the 4 per cent, deposits,
which fall due between 19,10 and 1904 is to be repaid at
once, and the rest (£534,872) is to be turned into perpe-
tual 4 per cent, stock, payable when the bank feels like
it, and at no other time. The present 4 per cent, perpe-
tual debentures remain as they were. As to the £2,023,965
of per cent, stock, one-half of this is to bear 3 per
cent, interest in the future ; and the other half,
though nominally a 3 per cent, stock, is to bear
interest at any rate from nothing up to 4J4 per cent,
according to the bank’s earnings. If the bank doesn’t
prosper it may get nothing. If it does prosper this second
half of the old 4£ per cent, stock will get 3 per cent, in-
terest in the first place ; then £15,000 a year is to go to a
reserve for the better security of the stockholders, and
any remaining surplus is to go towards raising the interest
to the original 41 per cent. Therefore the bank saves
£l4,263perannum by repaying part of the 4 per cent, stock.
It also saves £15,179 per annum for certain by reducing
interest on one-half of the inscribed stock from 4£ to 3 per
cent. And it may save anything up to £45,539 per annum
on the other half according to the interest paid, so that
the total interest saving is anywhere between £29,442 and
£74,981 per annum according to circumstances. The con-
sent of the creditors is alleged to be practically assured,
so the E.S. and A. seems likely to get rid of a good part
of its present burden.

The Intercolonial Investment, Land and Build-
ing Co. (Sydney), which has been struggling with pretty
hard circumstances for some time, pays a dividend for the
half-year at the rate of 10 per cent, per annum, and
begins to look better. It has now a reserve-fund of £6BOO
and a bank balance of £1957, as compared with an over-
draft of £4837 a year ago ; and £3OOO has lately been
written off the assets. Liabilities have been reduced from
£79,000 in 1891 to £19,258. At the same time, the net
profits for the half-year are only £1960, and as the divi-
dend of 10 per cent, absorbs £1584 of this, there is only
£376 to carry forward. And the profits are mostly froiii
the business done in Westralia, which is a country where
the bottom is apt to fail out of things very suddenly ;
therefore the Intercolonial would do well to go slow till
it gets somewhat stronger. Eight per cent, should be
enough to satisfy any reasonable individual.

The National Bank (Melbourne) announces that
it will, in Sept, next, pay off another instalment (about

deposits have lately sold at £1 os. 4d. in the £, and Vic-
toria deposits at £l.

A person named William Stokes Cottew writes
from Tottenham (England) to the Vic. Government that
the idea of a State Bank “is my copyright for England
and the Australasian colonies, and was copyrighted as far
back as Sept., 1895.” If the Vic. Government starts a
State Bank W. Stokes Cottew requires that he shall be the
first President at £5OOO a year for five years, £3OOO a year
afterwards until he retires from old age at 65, and after
that a life pension of £BOO a year. And if a State Bank
is started without his permission W. Stokes Cottew pro-
poses to raise legal Cain and tear up this country by the
roots. The Bulletin hereby returns a verdict that Wil-
liam Stokes C. appears to have a fine large copyright.

The principle that unclaimed moneys in banks
and other financial institutions, and unclaimed dividends
of all descriptions, should be the property of the State, is
gradually obtaining recognition. South Australia has
already enforced the principle, and the second year that
the Act was in operation it produced a net revenue of
over £lO,OOO. On the basis of population, a similar Act,
strictly enforced, should pan out, in Victoria or N.S.
Wales, for at least £20,000 a year as a steady income—a
considerable item of revenue. Maoriland last year passed
an Unclaimed Money Bill through the Assembly, but the
Council threw it out by a majority of three. The Vic.
Government will probably make an attempt at an Un-
claimed Money Bill shortly; £20,000 or £30,000 a year is
something just now in the land of the perennial deficit.

Col. North, it is cabled, died worth only half-a-

scale at six millions, and he has been taking off weight
ever since. He had more faith in Australian mines than
the money he made out of them. The sudden cutting out
of the Londonderry staggered him, and he took the
chance of growling savagely at three of the discoverers who
happened to be m London spending some of his gold.

Weekly statements of B.H. Proprietary output
having become little better than rough computations, the
directors have determined to henceforward make known
the product only once a month. The report for the
future will be in effect a refinery statement, as the whole
of the product now goes through this branch of the co s
works. For some time to come the output will be reduced,
as it is officially announced, for about the 20th time, that
“ it is inadvisable to continue extracting the oxidised
ores at a high rate.”
What the B. H. Co. proposes is toerectalarge con-
centrating works, capable, with the present plant, of dealing
with about 10,000 tons crude sulphides weekly, and to use
the lead concentrates for blending with the oxidised ores,
of which it is estimated 1J million tons still remain in the
mine. The zinc concentrates are to be “reserved for
future treatment ” —in the indefinite period when a satis-
tactory process is offered to the co. The Ashcroft and
llowell (lllawarra) people don’t suit for the purpose, as so
tar they, as buyers only of ore straight out, want to make
the profit. The present announcement is afrankacknow-
lu i'i'ifH*' though “ it is now proved beyond question
that the B. H. sulphides can be profitably worked,” the
best available methods of treatment are merely tentative.
Concentration and the subsequent treatment of the lead
product alone signify at the most the immediate saving of
55 or 60 per cent, of the total value of the metallic con-
tents of the ore. Certainly the zinc product is “ being
reserved for future treatment; ” but they would be ven-
turesome directors who would, in their statement of
assets, take credit for a dump Of these tailings or slimes.
The English holder of B.H. Proprietaries seems
to get hold of earlier information about the mine and its
prospects than the Australian holders can. There is little
doubt that it was on the strength of a coming reduction
in output that some English holders let out scrip several
weeks back. On the whole, though, it is doubtful if on
the circular issued to shareholders any fall is justified.
Divs. may be occasionally passed (the extreme probability
of that was officially stated six months back), but the
statement as to the quantity of oxidised ore remaining—
H million tons —is far more satisfactory' than the last pre-
ceding statements of the kind justified one in expecting.
Certainly it may not be all good smelting ore ; anyway',
the lead contents —average, 12 per cent. —are comparatively
small, and for blending it is good lead stuff that is wanted.
The B.H. directors also state that the sulphide
ore explored above the 400 ft. level north of Jamieson’s
shaft, and above the 500 ft. south of this point—about mid-
way along the property—amounts to 2,019,000 tons, with
a probable 600,000 tons only partly explored. This ore
has been carefully sampled, knd assay results show an
average of 24 - 3 per cent, lead, 21 "9 zinc, and 18’5oz. silver.
A very'good ore indeed. That sulphide upon which the
South has been operating contains from 30 to 40 per cent,
lead, from 16 to 20 per cent, zinc (the more zinc the worse
for present purposes, generally speaking), and soz. toBoz.
silver. Block 14 began on ore containing from 20 to 24
per cent, lead, 20 to 28 per cent, zinc, and 12oz. to 20oz.
silver. But, for all that, the directors’ statement might
be more satisfactory. This is, it will be seen, a statement
of average assays : what it would be better to know is the
quantity of ore containing more than, say, 20 per cent,
lead, 12oz. silver, and not more than 20 per cent, zinc—or
whatever the grade is under which profit is impossible
under present known and available methods of treatment.
What, though, can have been the object of an-
nouncing that such-and-such a quantity of ore of a given
average grade had been developed above this 400 ft.-level ?
(The 500 ft.-level south of Jamieson’s,is, by the wa.v, not
500 ft. deep, on account of this section of the mine occu-
pying a natural depression). Comparatively speaking,
and so far as the sulphides are concerned, 400 ft. is the
surface. And assuming a consumption of 10,000 tons
sulphides weekly, the quantity stated—about 2) million
tons—would last only five years. Why' not a word of re-
ference to the sulphides lying Underneath—those “prac-
tically unlimited millions” of which so many eloquent
things have been said? We have got so used to directors
reminding us of the cheerful features of a case that, when
they neglect to do so, we sniff suspiciously. That, at any
rate, is what the public have been doing; hence a small
slump in all Barrier stock.
The Ashcroft and Howell co’s may be able to
treat the sulphides, extracting front them practically the
whole of the meta.l, But, as before mentioned, they are
not content to run mere custom-works. This is the point
of view of those who favor the sale of the South. “ Quite
likely,” they say, “the mine is worth more than the
£240,000 which will probably be the price agreed upon.
But what is the use of the mine if we have to sell our con-
centrates for a few shillings a ton to people who make
almost as many pounds out of them ? ” The processes are
patented, in short that is the trouble. And no doubt
the sale of sulphide ore and concentrates has not gener-
ally been satisfactory The South, after over two and a-
quarter years’ operations with the mill, has paid no div.
The Junction has paid nothing commensurate with either
the quality or quantity of the ore extracted. Block 14
began to pay dividends when it began to buy ore largely.
So far, the buyers have had the best of the bargain ; and
the companies which long gave the cold shoulder to
private experimentalists, and even to the experimentalists
among their own officers (Ashcroft, for instance, who was
at length obliged to take his laboratory to his private
house !) have themselves to thank for it mostlv.

In his annual report the N.S.W. Inspector of
Mines placards the B.H. Block 10 and Central mines for
doing “ scarcely anything in compliance with the (Lead
Poisoning) Act. This is especially the case,” he adds,
“ in regard to changing-house and washing and bathing
accommodation ; and I am of opinion that strong mea-
sures will have to be taken before the companies named
will comply with the Act in this particular.” Can these
be the same companies whose directors but lately stood
aghast at their miners’ alleged disregard for “law’norder ” ?
Are you listening, Premier Reid ?
Eighty-eight cases of lead-poisoning reported to

posed to the affection. Hence the steady importation of
men from Victorian fields. Are you listening, Premier

To produce .£1,315,929 worth of gold in N.S.W.
last year 21,343 men, including 833 Chinese, labored. The
average value of gold per man was thus about £6l 10s.
To win the £1,644,563 worth of silver and lead mined and
exported from Broken Hill 4150 men were employed,
giving an average of £396 10s. per man. The value of
machinery employed was approximately the same. But
the coke, timber and coal charges against the gold-mining
industry are infinitely smaller than in the other case—a
circumstance which the wage-working silver-miner is apt
to forget when he enters on a crusade against the silver-

“ Cobar is full of experts aud speculators, but in

There are good mines at Cobar but, so far, they can all be
counted on the fingers, and the chance of finding any
more in the immediate vicinity is remote. Cobar could
attract a lot of Bull’s money, but for a mine bringing, say,
two or three shillings a share on the market—which is,
after all, the only gauge of value—they usually want six

an extremely level head. Some of his big schemes have
come off absolutely, others haven’t. One of his boldest
proposals was during the Boom, when he took steps in
the direction of effecting a gigantic combine among all
the big dailies of Australia. When he sought, for a start,
to combine the S.M. Herald and the Sydney D.T., the
Herald people wouldn’t bite.

The Great Eastern Co’s lease at an island in the
Yarra, at Warrandyte, has been declared forfeited by the
Vic. Minister of Mines on the application of a party of
working men, for breach of labor conditions. “ Unlock
the Victorian goldfields ” might well be made a political
plank in mining districts, for the area of shepherded land
is enormous, and tends to make Victoria, whatever its
gross gold-yield, by no means a poor man’s field. Apathy
on the part of miners is responsible for much of the
abuse, for the labor conditions are usually stringent. The
success in this case, up to the present, should induce
“ jumpers ” to perform a real public service in other
directions. The forfeiture was preceded by an unsuccess-
ful attempt to bringabout an amalgamation of theopposing
interests.

The Mt. Hepburn estate gold-mine has reached
London at last. Many a futile effort has been made to
get it there. Capital £200,000. The object as set out is
“ to carry on the business of a mining, milling, smelting
and metallurgical co. in all or any of its branches, and to
lay out towns and villages, and to promote immigration.”
It is a cheerless-looking hole stoped out to a depth of 300
or 400 ft., and has long remained unworked because —well,
it doesn’t look quite as good as the Long Tunnel. Now it
is self-condemned : “ To promote immigration ! ”

It is not the batteries that are coming to a field
but the batteries which are up that tell the story. Here
are a few around Coolgardie : Mt. Burgess, 15 heads, no
returns for many months; Bendigo Coolgardie, erected
nearly two years, 15 heads, never had one payable crush-
ing; Bayley’s Reward, 20 head, shut up ; Golden Bar, an
Otis ball mill (equal to 10 heads), nothing to crush ; Em-
press of Coolgardie, 10 heads, never had anything to
crush ; Tindall’s 10 heads, mine working, battery idle.
The list could be extended if necessary.
The impudence of the Westralian governing
ring knows no courts. In a mining case, heard at Kal-
goorlie last week, the warden is reported to have said
that “he had received instructions not to receive any
more appeals.” It was pointed out that the Mining Act
specially provided for appeals, and the warden then said :
—“ lam advised that I am to sit ministerially, and not
judicially, and that my recommendations are dealt with
by the Governor-in-Council, and that there can be no
appeal. I don’t agree with the instructions that have
been sent to me, but they definitely instruct me that I am
to allow no appeals to the Supreme Court.” Apparently,
the Govt, is cancelling an Act of Parliament to suit its
own pleasure, or convenience, or mining interest. They
are a long-suffering lot in Westralia.

On Monday the new manager wired : “Prospect mine
disappointing, nothing payable found worth prospecting ;
locality good ; title insecure ; defeotive pegging ; litiga-
tion probable. Report follows.” A pure gem of con-
demnatory abridgment which applies to nine-tenths of
the W.A. mines which, having really said nothing coher-
ent for themselves, are being tipster-boomed. There is no
better way to find out such mines than by sending along

The secret divorces granted from time to
time by N.S.W. Supreme Court constitute a
blazing scandal and a bitter satire on the boasted
equality of all before the law. For it is a signifi-
cant coincidence that when the approaches to the
divorce-court have been barred during ordi-
nary sitting-hours, or whenever the Judge has
sat at half-past eight a.m. to grant a divorce, the
persons most directly interested have been of much
political or social importance. You never have
strangers shut out of court or the name of a
coming case kept out of the official list where the
parties are a laborer and his wife —any more than
you ever see a black-coated man flogged at the
triangles.

Darley, C.J. (N.S.W.) : “I have never yet
tried a (divorce) case in camera, but, if occasion
arose, I would not hesitate to do so.” His Honor,
therefore, claims the statutory power to hold Star
Chamber trials whenever he is game to say that
“ occasion arises. ” What constitutes an “arisen
occasion ? ” Is it defined by law, or by liver? If
by law, the law must be amended. If by liver,
try calomel over an adjournment. Hitherto,
THE DROVING OF THE FUTURE.
Wool being low, and kangaroos and rabbits having become
valuable, the drover of the future will drive before him, not sheep

“ nicest people ” wanted to be unspliced.

Said Vic. Chief-Justice Madden one day
last week, as he made the usual decree in the case
of a couple whom Parson Kinsman had united:
“ Really, I think a good- deal of time and trouble
and expense would be saved to parties generally
if an Act of Parliament were passed making all
marriages celebrated by the Rev. N. Kinsman
dissolvable after two years.” Kinsman seems to
celebrate more marriages than any other three Vic.
parsons, so he naturally has more divorces than
any other rev. in the province. And as he is a
cheap, unfashionable person who throws people
together in a common sort of way in a furniture-
shop, Kinsman isn’t popular, and the bench makes
weak jokes about him in consequence, and the
Church won’t play in his yard. Still, Kinsman is
more in keeping with the fitness of things than
many other parsons ; marriage is a pretty squalid
affair in most cases, and when the second stage of
it is a wooden cottage on piles, and a waste garden,
and a gate that hangs on one hinge, then the first
stage may as well be the furniture-shepherd’s back
room as any other place. Marriage, with the
average woman, is mostly kitchen and back yard,
and ash-keg, and piles of greasy dishes, and an
expectant milk-jug on the window-sill and a
sodden loaf on the doorstep, and why a woman
should wear orange-blossom and be married in the
light of a big stained-glass window, merely that
she may wash up dishes for the term of her natural
life, is a mystery. It is like opening a mud-cart
with prayer.

A witness who came too drunk to give evi-
dence in the George Love murder-case in a Sydney
court, last week, was sent to the cells for an hour
or two by Acting-Judge Rogers, and then dis-
missed with the threat that if he did not come
sober to court next day he would be sent to gaol
for three months. The witness came sober, and
so the matter ended. Just GO years ago Judge
Burton behaved differently with a similarly in-
toxicated witness in a murder-case in a Sydney
court. This witness was summarily fined £5O for
contempt and was not afterwards called on for
testimony. The notorious Lynch was the prisoner
in the dock on that occasion, and he was acquitted
owing to the absence of that drunken witness’s
evidence, and was thus aUle to complete an appal-
ling career of murder and outrage.

A question asked in Sydney : Why did not
criminal proceedings of some kind arise out of the
developments consequent on those anonymous
letters lately sent to Mr. Justice Simpson in a
divorce-case ?
In Melb. recently two men
were fined ss. each for breaking
the Sabbath by drying bear-
skins on the Day of Rust. Bear-
skins, it appears, take eight or
ten consecutive days to dry,
therefore they have to dry on
at least one Sunday ; and the
furriers weren’t actually drying
them—their crime consisted in
leaving the skins in the sun on
that day and allowing Provi-
dence to break the Sabbath by
letting the law of evaporation
go on as usual. The magistrate
who inflicted the fines had pro-
bably broken the same Sabbath
in the same way by drying
himself on that day, or even if
he didn’t dry himself it is to be
that he dried natu-
rally, just like the skins. It
would be interesting to know if
a case would lie against a man
who grew his beard on the
Sunday in the city of Fitzgibbon,
or whose hair was found increas-
ing in length, or whose infant
didn’t stop growing. If it
wouldn’t, why wouldn’t it ?
Why doesn’t some one start a
society for carrying the Sabbath
law to its logical conclusion, and
issue 420,010 summonses on
Monday morning against the
whole population of Melbourne
because their skin evaporated
on the previous day ?

Anglican Primate Smith
gravely reminded a Sydney sub-
urban parish, the other day, that
it ought to “ get beyond the
narrow circle and reach the
wider one,” and that it should
“ remember that they were all
members of a complex, com-
posite body.” That’s just what’s
the matter with the whole hier-
archy of which S. Smith is a
shilling bishop, and with every
other religious hierarchy. Those
bodies forget that they are “ all
members of a complex, composite body ” called the
human race.

Those who argue that sons, or very near
relatives, of Judges, who practise as barristers in
Courts over which these Judges preside are likely
to acquire adventitious favor in suitors’ eyes, may
illustrate their argument by comparing N.S.W.
Divorce Court proceedings, from a barristerial
point of view, in the new regime of Justice Simp-
son with the average of proceedings in the days of
his Honor Windeyer. Then Mr. Richard (son), if
he did not appear for petitioner, generally figured
for respondent or co-respondent, and it was con-
sidered passing strange if Mr. Ralston (son-in-law)
had not a hold of some end of every case. Now
new barrister faces are seen and new barrister
voices heard from day to day, and the Windeyer-
esqueness of the proceedings no longer offends eye
and ear.

Sydney Evening News, in discussing John
Haynes’s motion to abolish capital punishment in
N.S.W., instances the case of the celebrated
Lynch, of Berrima, as that of a pre-eminent
assassin about whom there was no suspicion of
insanity. Only the other day the present writer
heard an eminent “mad-doctor” incidentally
“DUCKS!”
mention the case of Lynch as that of “ a typical
homicidal maniac—no doubt of it. ” Anyone who
reads Lynch’s confession, as set forth'in Judge
Therry’s “Reminiscences of N.S.W. and Vic-
toria,’ can hardly fail to come to a similar con-
clusion about the man, whose habit it was, before
committing murder, to kneel down and pray to
God for “ strength and direction.”

Benalla, Vic., possesses a clerical innova-
tor who illustrates his sermons with magic-lantern
slides. In the dead middle and centre of firstly,
fifthly, or lastly, brethren, lights are switched off,
and worshippers are favored with a gorgeous car-
toon to point the moral and adorn the sermon
This, the shepherd hopes, “will attract the non-
churchgoing people of Benalla.” Well, it ought
to. There is no sense in spooning your girl out in
the frost and fog these winter nights if you can do
it in a warm, dry church in the dim, religious light
when Moses is coming down the Mount on a wet
sheet, or when the congregation is being won over
to righteousness by a lime-light picture of Sheol
with the Devil in the foreground stirring up fat
sinners with a hayfork. Artemus Ward long ago
discovered the popularity of a magic-lantern show
amongst young couples, and it is pleasant to
find the clergy of our time not above taking a
pointer from the genial showman.

Hint to the New Woman : A skirt divided
against itself cannot stand.
An Avenel (Vic.) defunct
had willed that his widow’s al-
lowance should cease if she
remarried ; also that, in such
event, her control of the child-
ren should cease, because he
would “not give any man the
chance of ill-treating them ”;
but that she should still have
a house and land at Avenel, “so
that she shall have a house over
her head if her second husband
deserts her.” Queer compound
of care and jealousy is a truly-
loving hubby ! This one evi-
dently foresaw the possibility
that his “ownest'’ might be
worth marrying—and deserting !
The will is in contrast to that
of the historical old curmudgeon
who left his wife “ .A2OO a year
so long as she remains single,”
but left to any future husband
she might get “ .£5OO a year,
as compensation, and because he
will find that he will need every
penny of it.” Which of these
twain loved his lady the more ?

One half of St. Andrew’s
kirk, Newcastle (N.S.W.), want,
according to the case put by the
other half, to inflict upon a
meenister “life-long punishment
for one fault ” —“ an indiscretion
at Broken Hill years ago. ” Thus,
you see, human nature —even the
human nature of kirk-men-re-
volts at the undue severity that
it daily preaches according to
its ritual and catechism. The
Pharisaical section, in this in-
stance, is at least logical. For
the dogma of Calvindom is that,
if a man dies with one little
peccadillo unfory.ven, he must endure everlasting
punishment “in a bottomless pit, full of flames
and brimstone. ” Hell!

Interesting case from Bendigo. A book-
maker’s clerk was up on various charges before the
local “ Binch.” Result, as Age reported
For striking the barmaid, fined £2; for striking the
constable, fined £3 ; for using obscene language in the
hotel, discharged ; and for using obscene language in the
presence of the constable, fined £2.
So it is cheaper by £1 to lambaste a barmaid than
a policeman, and whilst a man may curse a bar-
maid with impunity, he runs a great risk in cor-
rupting a constable with swear-words. This is
what is called police protection.

With the beginning of the really cold
weather in Melbourne, it is strange to see the
leading drapery houses sacrificing their winter
goods to make room for an early show of spring
fashions. Such is the case* however ; and it is
marvellous to note the extreme manner in which
the prices of articles which one would have
thought would just be in the greatest demand—such
as furs, sealskin jackets, winter mantles, dress
stuffs, &c.—are reduced at Messrs. Hicks Atkin-
son and Sons’establishment in Collin-street during
their existing stock-taking sale.*

JAMES KIDMAN,
GEORGE & MARKET STREETS, SYDNEY; RILETTER STREET, LONDON
foolisTTfy ventured into a Salvation 1 f anny
meeting, where, in a weak moment, he allowed'
himself to be converted. One of the female cap-
tains took him unawares, and cried, “Come!
come ! come now ! ” into his expansive ear until he
tottered up to the penitent form and became a
saved soul. The Harmy entered his soul in the
official ledger and the War Cry included him in
its weekly total of conversions. Three weeks of
new life made James so strong in the Lord that
lie rose Upon the platform, at the end of an excit-
ing Sunday might service, and swore himself into
.the Harmy ranks by ordering a scarlet guernsey
and cap at lSs. The next thing heard from James
was a story of his having been stuck up by high-
-waymen and robbed of the money he had set apart
for-the purchase of his Harmy regalia. But the
penitent’s tale soon turned out to be a pure and
beautiful lie. It was a . highway woman whom
James encountered. The naughty creature led
him away by the quiet waters of the Yarra
and it is believed he gave her a sovereign
instead of a sixpence. James is not certain
upon that point. All he will swear to is
his present deep regret for a burst of religious
fervor which was the root of his moral disaster.

A pathetic bush-story full of human nature:
Dear Bulletin, — I camped with an ancient whaler the
other night. When he unrolled his swag there dropped
out, to my surprise, a pair of lady’s silk stockings. “ What
do I want them for? Well, I tell yer : when I goes to a
boundary’s hut for rations, I tells him I’ve got no rations-
bag, an’use these here things. The boundary-riders don’t
often see a woman, an’ how do they fill up those stockings
with flour ! Fill, they do fill ! 6x 8.

A Sydney registry-office case which should
warn women seeking work in the country. A
mother and daughter engaged in Sydney to act as
cook and housemaid respectively to five persons on
a station between Cobar and Wilcannia. On ar-
rival (so says a Bulletin correspondent) they
found eleven people instead of the agreed-upon
five, and demanded more wages. They were re-
fused, and, being penniless, they had to irnlk into
Cobar, a distance of nearly 100 miles. They had
neither blankets nor tucker, and the station re-
fused all assistance in the shape of vehicle, money,
or food.

The fantastic anomalies of the Tas. police
force under municipal-control are borne with by
police and public as a less evil than the system
of Govt, centralisation which obtained in the bad
old days. It is useless pointing out that the con-
ditions have changed since the palmy days of the
policeman. The horrors of that sort of Govern-
ment control have left memories that stick fast,
and the shades of Muster-master Mason and John
Price are Called up directly police centralisation is
mentioned.

A small, pale, scared-looking member of
the N.S.W. Cabinet attended the recent Sydney
dog-show with his family, and, as usual, the
smallest progeny got away and tried to fool with
the ugliest bull-dog he could find. The conster-
nated Minister rushed after him, and hauled him
off by the back of his clothes, just as the bull dog
began to grow friendly with his small visitor.
Then a ribald Opposition scoffer raised a guffaw :
“ Look at ’im,” he said ; “ that’s our Dog-fearing
Ministry! ”
A queer case, in which a complexion-fakir

He was a bushman of about 6ft. sin. And
he was travelling up-country by Cobb and ( 'o. s
coach, inside passage. Every time the coach
jumbled into a rut the high knees of the bush
Goliath knocked against the opposite passenger,
a lady, in pleasant hammer-and-anvil fashion. At
last the coach stopped to change horses and the
son of Anak rose, remarking : “ I think 111 get
out to stretch my legs a bit.” “ Don t, for heaven s
sake,” exclaimed the victim, “they’re much too
long already !”

up to 4in. deep in a finefy-pulverised dust that rises as a
mist many feet even when the air is still. You can’t
escape breathing it—dust of all sort s, including decom-
posed human excreta. No wonder typhoid is not abating.
Fully five persons a day are being planted in this filthy

liked, and died worth some t'60,000. One deal he never
knew about was his purchase of 603 Bank of Englands at
about £l. Before advice came he was in the hospital, llis
executors can now get £8 a-piece for these shares. A boom
is on, and one that promises to eclips? any preyihus booms
experienced in Australia. Some 30,000 shares change
hands daily in Coolgardie alone. In Adelaide a record of
84,000 was reached. Take a few stocks :

AN UNAVOIDABLE DEFORMITY.
BARMAID (to recent importation, whose expected remittances have failed t»
arrive): “But couldn’t you get some temporary employment, Mr.
De Vere?”
DE VERE : “Atom ’fwaid Aw cawn’t—born with a silver spoon in me mouth,
don’t-cher-kno w! ”
BARMAID : "What a pity.” (Gets an idea.) “ The hospital doctors are very
clever. Before they operated on my brother’s tongue, he couldn't
speak even as distinctly as you.”
The stranger, a reputable barrister, protested that
he was somebody else’s husband, that he was not
claimant’s property and never had been, but the
woman knew the wart on his neck and the color
of his whiskers, and swore to him by his ear and
back teeth, and the law took its course, the man
in dispute proved, with some difficulty, to the
satisfaction of the Bench that he was the person
he claimed to be, and then claimant admitted that
perhaps he wasn’t her long-lost husband after all,
but insisted that he was so like the missing pro-
perty that she ought to be allowed the benefit of
the doubt. But the man escaped, and the woman
went out on the trail again. The female in pursuit
of a misplaced hubby is more to be dreaded than a
ravening lion.
The suicide at Gilgunnia (N.S.W.) of a
miner, by placing on his tongue a plug of racka-
rock with a lighted slow fuse and dynamite-cap
attached, conjures up to the fancy a gruesome
picture. The nerve (or deadly coma) of a man
who can lie down and watch ignition stealing
slowly along the fuse, with the full knowledge that
in a few torture-lingering seconds his skull will be
blown to bits, is not comprehensible to a healthy
mind. Heroism isn’t in the same street with this
—a method of suicide not uncommon among Aus-
tralian miners.

The unctuous
Canadian Commis-
sioner J. S. Larke
has been having a
talk to Sydney
“business men’’
about ‘ ‘ co-partner-
ship with God,”
whom “hedescribed
as the senior part-
ner, who put all the
working-capital into
the firm, yet took
nothing out. His
co-partners received
all the profits. ” Just
so. And it is quite
apparent to the
sweated underlings
and to the unem-
ployed that His co-
partners are F at-
man, Shindykit,
Importer and Co.
only. So that when
the poor man doffs
his hat, or touches
his forelock, to his
boss, or his boss’s
brother-boss, he is,
in a manner of
speaking, “ doing a
reverence ” to the
Almighty. The
Deity isn’t to be
congratulated on his
little brother Bill.
In California,
divorces are granted
for “cruel and in-
human treatment. ”
Right but the
courts have most
liberal ideas of what
“ cruel and inhu:
man ” treatment is.
One man com-
plained : “ My wife
would not get up in
the morning, nor
would she call me ;
she would do no-
thing I asked her to
do. All this has
caused me mental
suffering and an-
guish.” Decree
granted. Another
alleged: “ During
our whole married
life my husband has
never offered to take
me out riding. This
has been a great
source,” etc. Decree
nisi. Had Judge
Windeyer visited that court he certainly
would have been , able to take up its business
in the absence of the local judge, and he would
have pleased suitors. Justice Windeyer is at
least missed from N.S.W. divorce-court: a? is
well known, he has broader views on divorce than
any of his brethren of the bench.
A RECEIPT IN VERSE.
O’, party possessed of a live sense
Of duty and honor and shame,
We beg to acknowledge the fivepence,
And place to your credit the same.
You were caught, like a ram in a thicket,
As Satan remarked with a sneer,
But, now you have paid for the ticket,
Your conscience is clear.
You walk as before in tlje right way,
Relieved from fivepenn’orth of sin ;
The Kingdom of Glory, one might say,
You’ve merely to go in and win.
Whilst many a weak, erring creeter
Stops short at the gateway in fear,
You’ll pass, with a note from St. Peter—
“ His conscience is clear.”
And yet, had you died in a smash-up,
A railway catastrophe sad,
On the day you omitted to cash-up,
No doubt you’d have gone to the bad,
Deprived of all hope of salvation,
Cut off from repentance sincere.
You lived to make full reparation—
Your conscience is clear.
Your Bulletin sisters and brothers
Rejoice at your cleansing from crime,
More than over the ninety-nine others
Who paid up their fares at the time.
Pear holds craven souls in subjection :
They’d cheat every day in the year
But for dreading the risk of detection—
Your conscience is clear.

Sydney, June 16, 1896.
My Dear Moorabinda—
N.S.W. Women’s Suffrage League continues
to —no, not buck-up—pig-jump is more expressive
of the situation. At the last Quinquatria, as one
may call it, the outlook was pretty gloomy, from a
well-wisher’s standpoint. The lady who presided
Bu ßg'Gsted cold cream more than common-sense,
and the attendance about reached the ominous
total of 45, including a parson and a doctor, of
course, for without at least one of each no feminine
crisis can ever be called complete. The secretary
made an elaborate address which consisted of
enumerating the lone, lorn blue-stockings dotted
all over the globe who had become sanitary in-
spectors, and things like that, which somehow led
gently up to three cheers for Parkes; but there
was only -modified enthusiasm when a friendly
M. Prose and asserted that it was very probable
that in five years or so N.S.W. would give women
the suffrage. Upon which a spinster was heard
remarking in a disheartened tone of voice that the
women of N.S.W. didn’t feel disposed to wait five
years, and the meeting terminated. But what a
world it is for poor weak woman—especially of the
Woman-Suffrage sort! No sooner does she give
up waiting for a husband than she starts on the
old, dreary, hope-deferred racket after a cold and
bloodless vote.
Christianity is going to be the swagger thing
this season, and Anybody who is Anybody will have
to convert the nearest Chow or other bad charac-
ter if he or she wishes to prove a claim to
belong to the Nicest people. Tracts will go up to
five shillings a dozen, I expect, now that there is
to be a Bible-class for the forelock-pulling Factory
Club girls on Sabbath afternoons at Guvmentouse.
But it’s really amazing to me to contemplate the
unblushing versatility of the “great,” who on
Saturday graciously lend their patronage to what
they attribute to the Devil, but who are found on
Sunday expounding the Word and singing hymn
one noughty-nought with their eyes rolled up. Is
“ official ” character conveniently made in parti-
colored layers like moral Swiss rolls ?
Apropos the Factory Girls’ Club, rather an in-
comprehensible line crept into the last official re-
port therefrom : “The hon. treas. to the mother’s
sick maternity fund stated . . . there was a
good balance in hand. It was stated that as this
fund had proved such a boon to mothers, it had
been determined to start one for girls on the same
lines.”
This appears to be good weather for deputations
—the last feminine one of importance in Sydney
being headed by the Acting-Governoress, who
bearded Georgey-Porgey on the subject of seating
accommodation for shop-girls, shorter hours, and
a, universal weekly half-holiday. It was very
fitting that a deputation of women should tackle
the subject, for you haven’t far to “ chercher la
femme ” when you come to the sorrows of Jenny
Wren. It was no doubt to soothe the self-love of
some snobess, who would rather shake hands with
a cat than a couturi&re, that serving-girls were
first forced to stand deferentially on one foot while
the snobess flopped all over a chair, and even now
how many arrogant nobodies are there who would
gasp like fish out of water if a girl attempted to
sell them a packet of pins sitting down—the girl I
mean, not the pins !
There has always been something particularly
heinoqs in the idea of a “ young woman ” sitting
down in the presence of those who are not women,
thank goodness—and in a variegated community
like this, where if the sewing-women didn’t stand
up it would generally be difficult to distinguish
which was which, you can’t say there hasn’t been
some method in this milliners’ martyrdom. It’s a
gentlemanly act, anyhow, to hand a lady a chair,
and it will be a serious blot on Georgey-Porgey’s
reputation as a ladies’ man if he doesn’t see the
thing right through.
It is barbarous to insist on girls standing up so
long. I don’t think, mind you, that they should
sit while they are serving—that would look too
much like Tasmanian notions of business energy—
but in between they should certainly be allowed
to rest. It is high time, too, that something was
done. In quite a number of shops lately I have
been struck by the _ bloodless, woe-begone, un-
healthy faces of the girls. And they are naturally
a nice-looking lot, are Sydney shop-girls, if you
give them half a chance.
A grievance comes to me from up North —but it
really is common all over Australia, wherever
mixed public balls eventuate. It is merely the
old, old story of the girl whose pa has struck it
lucky, and her terrible scorn when she finds her-
self, at a public ball, involved in a “ square ”
without epaulettes or gold buttons upon her
vis-a-vis. The Society damsel in this case, who
left in the middle of a set of Lancers, is only one
remove from a grocer’s shop, and would be selling
soap over papa’s counter had mere chance not
changed all that. However, this sort of thing,
common in Australia as ticks, is the very worst
possible form (for there is nothing easier than
standing out if the personnel of the set doesn’t
suit you), and yet the girls who do it vainly
imagine that it shows their superiority. And
thus is Guvmentouse rewarded for years of shining
example! To see the sublime patience and un-
varying sweetness with which her Ex. jigs with
Alderman Tallowfat doesn’t seem to be an object-
lesson to these shoddy females, who are so fright-
ened _of meeting their tailor in the grande chatne
that it almost looks as if they still owed him for
their bloomers.
In the teeth of such moral cramps it is really
refreshing to hear that at Gundagai (N.S.W.) the
other extreme has been rushed to. At a recent
meeting to arrange a bachelors’ ball squatters and
miners clinked glasses and vowed that no girl in
the district should go uninvited or do the Cinder-
ella act for want of a card. Governesses and
scullery-maids were alike greeted out of the same
mail-bag with resplendent cards of invitation dif-
fering in no wise from one another, Mrs. Pure
Merino’s lettering being no more golden than Mary
Ann’s. On the eventful evening the gathering
must have looked almost a length ahead of the
millennium. For my part, I would much rather
undertake to reconcile the lion and the lamb than
induce Mrs. Borndrunk to stand up in the same
set as her cook.
The reported death of sculler Stan bury, which
some irresponsible sensationalist cabled to Aus-
tralia on the strength of a mere capsize, must
have been a terrible ordeal for Mrs. Stanbury,
who has had the somewhat rare experience of
knowing exactly how a widow feels while she was
happily nothing of the sort in reality. It is a
wonder to me that the penny papers haven’t tried
to interview Mrs. S. as to how she felt before and
after the cable. A detailed description of her
mixed feelings would have supplied yards of copy.
It was evident all round that his native city meant
to get all the advertisement out of the allegedly-
drowned oarsman that it decently or indecently
could.
Ten minutes after the silly cable landed there
appeared at one of the Sydney florists a portrait
of the cahle-killed sculler surrounded by a funereal
wreath. When one saw this one could hardly
help a small, satirical smile—it was such a lovely
example of purely commercial sentiment caught
on the hop, so to speak—for there is really no
more sentiment in such displays than when a
draper puts an alluring spring costume on a winter
dummy. The only really sentimental window-
show I ever saw was in a Melb. florist’s a day
after the Cup. It was the saddle, bridle, whip
and cap, made up in flowers, of the colors of a
horse which hadn't come off. Yet they gave it
window-room for days.
Even at the best of times the wreath-racket
stirs one’s bile. The senders of wreaths are so
often pushing people, who take advantage of a re-
speetable person’s death to exaggerate their inti-
macy with the corpse and jump on it, as it were,
when it’s down and can’t retaliate with a frozen
stare or decline anything with thanks. And then
there is another phase of wreath-sending which is
just as interesting, when Great Folks suddenly
overflow on to the coffins of lower-class notorieties
who have been murdered or drowned, with big
white .wreaths and large visiting-cards attached.
When this happens you can always see an
election in the middle distance, or some event in
which the potentates and the public have a hand.
But perhaps the most barefaced wreath of all is
the wreath that gets sent by the actress, who is a
frost on foreign shores, to the year-old grave of the
sister actress with whom she was notoriously at
daggers-drawn during the latter’s life. However,
this is the age of advt., and corpses afford a golden
opportunity for a mob of people who cannot ex-
actly attract public attention to themselves per
medium of sandwich-men.
Some departed Personages, who make believe
that they still think of nothing but Australia,
have got the wreath business down to a fine art.
For example, the simple little cable words “Tobo,
Parkes,”from Lord Ear waggle, of London, to Perns'
the Sydney florist, really means : “ Lay a three-
guinea wreath on Parkes’s grave, charge me with
same deducting two-and-a-half discount for cash
within four months.” Whereas “Decent Jobson”
would mean, “ Lay a two-guinea wreath on Job-
son’s grave.” Judging by what one sees of the
aristocracy, I should imagine that “Decent” did
more submarine travelling than the more expensive
Tobo.
The ever-popular Tempe Ball, for which Mrs.
(Dr.) Maguire and Mrs. Brunton are hon. secs,
takes place at Sydney Town Hall on 30th June
and is going to break the record. Tickets always
sell well for Tempe Ball, which is known as the
Men’s ball, though I really cannot fathom why.
Two big concerts this month are Mdlle. Trebelli’s
show at the Town Hall this (Saturday) evening,
when that plump and polished vocalist will raise
her perfectly-trained soprano in song; and the
comp. ben. to organist Wiegand at Sydney Town
Hall on 27th instant (John Laure, hon. sec.), when
a gorgeous array of talent will give the gifted city
organist a fitting sent-off on his holiday tour.
Government seems to be making headway with
the Parkes family allowance debate, and the poli-
tical veteran’s widow won’t have to depend on
ravens for a crust, anyhow. By the way, Mr.
Affleck, M.P., rose during the discussion and
tried to insert a clause, disentitling the lady from
receiving the proposed allowance (£lOO a year)
“should she re-marry,” but the cruel amendment
was promptly pooh-pooh’d. The idea of anybody
bearing the name of Parkes being prevented from
committing matrimony as oftenas he or she pleased,
struck everybody as being too incongruous al-
together. •
When people reputed to be extensively in debt
promote charitable entertainments, in aid of not-
very-clearly-specified objects, suspicion, however
ill-grounded it may be, is necessarily aroused.
At the opening of Sydney Parliament, the other
day, the most tiresome bit of solemn fiddle-faddle
(which is saying a good deal on an occasion given
over to fuss and feathers and Mumbo-Jumbo) oc-
curred when the band was booming the Anathema
in the middle distance, and two ex-military men
standing near the Australian Club solemnly and
reverently uncovered to the distressing strains.
The worst part of it was that both were wearing
thin, not to say billiard-ball-ish, on top —through
wear and tear in saluting the many national idols,
I suppose. The average polite Englishman, punc-
tiliously disposed towards his Royal fetishes, runs
more danger from neuralgia in the head than a
dozen Australians put»together.
The latest fashionable craze is tattooing—a pecu-
liarly naughty effect being got by having the
lower eyelid tattooed, and no engaged girl is ortho-
dox without her Gussie’s image in Indian ink in
some partially-confidential position which yet may
be revealed to the right man at the psychological
moment. But any girl bent on illustrating her-
self ought to hunt up the Herculean cheap-Jaek
who performed at the last N.S.W. Agricultural
Show. He was a unique specimen who called
himself “ Charlie Nelson, the tattooed Irish
sailor,” but he was obviously more or less of the
race of Israel—probably less, as one rarely sees so
solid a man of the Hebraic persuasion. The mar-
vellously - energetic humourist was liberally
decorated with tattoo, and stood on his rostrum
with bare arms and trousers turned up past the
knees, the hero of the hour with the women.
Though, mind you, it isn’t altogether safe to plod-
dingly interpret the designs on every tattooed tar.
Most of the little weaknesses of Jack ashore have
a place in the picture-gallery, and so the design is
occasionally not adapted to exhibit in mixed com-
pany.
The latest romantic story is that of Constable
Bradley, who died of fever at a Westralian mining
town, and would have seen a baronet in his look-
ing-glass if he had lived long enough. His real
name was Lionel Bradley Pilkington, and he was
possible heir to an English baronetcy. If the
story is true, Lionel was a bold, bad baronet of
the most approved Family Herald type—he
eloped with the wife of an English milord before
he was of age, squandered a fortune, and came to
Australia on the good old English principle that
rubbish may be shot here. Then, of course, he
turned bobby in the old, old way of “ the nicest
people,” whose daughters have to turn dressmaker
(or waitress at six shillings a week—that, I am
told, is the usual Sydney-society-tea-shop figure)
when the money goes, and whose sons too often
find themselves intellectually on the level of rouse-
abouts when Pate sets them finding an occupation.
It somehow sounds romantic to hear of baronets
—but, after all, what are baronets ? Mostly the
seed of pushing pork-butchers who became mayors,
and so bought a title to distinguish their descen-
dents by. The only baronet I ever remember
having questioned on the subject of his earthly
greatness told me that his ancestor, who seemed
to have been an unspeakable kind of person, bought
the family brand for a couple of hundred pounds.
But that baronet looked cheap. I remember his
manners were en suite. He used to travel about
with a fox-terrier, upon whom he played off rude
remarks. “Toby,” he would say, gazing in the
tyke’s comparatively intelligent face, “you’ah
bored. Confess it, Toby, this pawty is boring you
dwedfully ! ”
Writes my Melb. correspondent:—
“Mrs. Be van and four youthful Be vans have
gone ’Ome and left the venerable-looking divine to
the care of the youngest daughter and eldest son.
When the boat was on the point of departure a
rapturous girl-friend flung one of the Miss Bevans
a diamond locket. Whether this was spontaneous
or a pre-arranged signal is not known, but the
large number of friends on the pier at once began
to shower some of the more valuable coin of the
realm upon the departing quintette, much to the
amusement of bystanders. The boys on board
caught quite a substantial sum in their hats.
“ The Rontgen photos will have much to answer
for. Already the rays have made revelations.
A needle was located in a patient’s hand at Melb.
hospital last week, and lively IMrs. Freeman
Thomas, the Governor’s daughter, had her hand
taken the other day, when it was discovered that
one of her fingers had been broken. Pa Brassey
turned a severe glance upon her, and enquired
when it happened, remarking that it was the first
he had heard of it. Thus was a youthful escapade
brought to light.
“By the irony of fate, baritone Douglas
Powell—from the English point of view the least
illustrious of the new quartette party—has turned
out the trump-card in Melb. He was simply a
promising junior thrown in as a fill-up, whereas
the other three are described as festival artists,

butable to his gushing, dAbonnaire stage
manner, youthful good looks and muscular
appearance, as to his fine voice and dramatic
singing. The Melb. girls, having lost the beau-
teous Brownlow, have now transferred their affec-
tions to baritone Powell aforesaid.

. . A Melb. penlady has lately got married, and
it is believed that she has wedded an agricultural

a secret that nobody in the press-world seems to
be quite certain whom the lady has married, with
the consequence that all the ostensibly unmarried
pressmen are more or less suspected. An acci-
dental mixing of copy has, however, it is thought
sheeted the matter home to the agricultural man!

SPORTING NOTIONS .
An Australian abroad gossips to The Bulletin
by last mail “ The match against Lord Sheffield’s
Eleven, at Sheffield Park, is generally considered ‘ more
bother than it is worth,’ and very rightly. This noble
patron of cricket has all kinds of fads and fancies and
rules and regulations, and, as it is his private ground and
he pays the Australians a lump sum to play, the only way is
to grin and bear him and get grey. Stoddart, as already
noted, has managed to quarrel with his Lordship, and a
good many other prominent cricketers wouldn’t mind if
they had.
“The Australian cricketers are having a good
time amongst the London theatres and music-halls? In
consequence of manager Musgrove’s connection with the
business, not only members of the team, but any friends
they like to take with them, are admitted to almost every
house in the town. J
“ The present team is going very slow re ban-
quets, &c., and in the first two weeks only attended a
couple. The invitations which pour in have on previous
occasions been accepted as a matter of course. Manager
Musgrove sticks to business, and is probably the first man
in the position who has made it a hard-and-fast rule not
to drink in the day-time. “Come and have a small bottle ”
is met by a cold and unbending refusal.
“ Though at first rather diffident, the cricketers
are gradually appearing in bell-toppers and frock-coats
Frank Iredale was the first, and it looks as though the
manager would be the last. When the metamorphosis is
complete a photograph of the team will be worth money.
“The net profits of the Sydney test-match to
the Australian Eleven amounted to £B2B—or over £6B per
man—not a bad start for the tour. Clem. Hill and Kelly
not being members at the time of the match, don’t share ”
* * • *
The time has arrived when Australia must pay
a substantial price for good professional cricketers, or be
content to serve as a nursery for English county-elevens.
The Giffens of the future will not stick to their native
land for the sake of a £3-a-week billet in the Post Office
when they might achieve.a comfortable competency at
’Ome. Why should they stop out here, any more than
native-born singers, painters, or sculptors of special merit
stop here, unless the fat-man “patrons of the noble game”
assist the local cricket-managers to make a market for
their talent? The S.A. Cricket Association has met the
inevitable half-way by offering Jones a fair inducement to
sell his services in Adelaide instead of Sussex. If N.S.W.
and Victoria want to retain the best of their non-amateur
bowlers they must recognise them as professionals and
pay them something like the English price, which is a
half-yearly income of £lO or £l2 a week, with the possi-
bility of complimentary benefits looming in the future.
* * * *
Ernest Jones, before he left for England, avowed
his intention to accept the first good offer from an English
county, so the offer from S.A. Cricketing Association is,
perhaps, too late. Jones was employed as an occasional
hand at S.A. Exhibition grounds, and was to have been
curator of the new S. Adelaide Oval, but that project is
still far off. J
* * * *
Providence, no doubt, ordained that awful col-
lapse of Trott’s Eleven at Lord’s as a punishment for
Melbourne Age. The journal in question, being a bare-
faced panderer to Young Australian prejudices in the
matter of cricket, slipped a saving clause (as it thought)
into its first cablegram re the M.C.C. match. The cable
said “ wickets heavy,” but seeing that the Englishmen
had scored 137 runs for 3 wickets down, the Age felt
bound to rub the gilt off their performance. Therefore,
the bare item of news was published in this form : “ The
wicket, however, is a little heavy owing to recent rains,
but experts describe it as being in an easy-playing condi-
tion.” For the initiated it goes almost without saying
that the “experts” and their opinion were possibly in-
vented by the Age sub. -editor, or somebody, who couldn’t
permit patriotic feeling to be wounded by the chance
of Australian bowling getting pasted when it ought to
have been the “bowlers’ day out.” Then came the judg-
ment on Ananias. “ Australia all out for 18.” Pougher
5 wickets for 0, J. Hearne 4 wickets for 4—and the ground,
alas for the Age !“in an easy-playing condition.” Hing-
lish barrackers may fairly argue that the whole team
(with Giffen prudently absenting himself) would have gone
down for 4 runs, but for the captain’s stupid mistake in
permitting Attewell to take a hand in the attack. The
Nottinghamshire man has always been regarded as a fair-
weather bowler, and in this instance, anyway, he was a
failure, with 14 runs scored off him for no wickets. The
fact that Attewell didn’t come off is additional testi-
mony to the merit of Pougher’s phenomenal record.
Pougher at his best was the most deadly of the
English bowlers last season, but he is less reliable than
some of the others.
* * * *
So far, no “ century ” has been compiled by an
English cricketer against the Aus. Eleven. On the other
hand, three have been placed to the credit of the Austra-
lians—Gregory (154), Darling and Giffen (each 115).
* * * *
As showing the looseness of English fielding at
the beginning of a cricket season. On Mav 7 Surrey
scored a first innings of 443 against Leicestershire, whilst
Yorkshire was making 400 runs for 5 wickets against
Warwickshire.
* * * *
Mold, the Lancashire bowler, proves that the
average English batsman has something to learn from the
Australian. A steady success in first-class matches among
his own people, Mold has generally failed to do much
against the visiting teams. Young Townsend, of Glouces-
tershire, seems to be another crack English bowler whose
art is simple enough to our boys.
* * * *
The formerly-consistent batsman Iredale’s dis-
mal failure to date in England is coupled by his friends
with his recent wedding. Athleticism and honeymooning,
apparently, mate no better in Iredale’s case than in that
of Zimmerman. “No man is worth much either six
months before or six months after marriage.”
*** s *
The Australian aboriginal runs as naturally to
cricket as the Maori to football. The other day a Kempsey
(N.S.W.) storekeeper offered a silver cup to be competed
for by local cricket-clubs. The darkies about Kempsey
immediately formed a club and entered under the appro-
priate name of “ True Australians ” ; and notwithstanding
they played against four other clubs they gloriously won
the cup. The white youths of Kempsey rather shun the
cricket subject now.
* * * »
Noted as a peculiar coincidence that in England
and Sydney Giffen is always attacked by sciatica when
he has to bat on a bad wicket.
* * * *
H. K. Foster and Hartley seem to have been
the most serviceable men in the defeated Oxford team.
Foster made 66 and 40 by brilliant hitting, and Hartley
finished first and third for the bowling and batting aver-
ages. This is not saying very much for him, ad the same.
* * * »
The funniest authentic sporting incident The
Bulletin ever heard of is the case of that Sydney football
referee who last Saturday had to draw on a dozen players,
furious at his decisions, the revolver “ he had brought for
the purpose of protecting himself.” “Does Football
Brutalise ? ”
* * * *
Betting on Sydney football isn’t as remunera-
tive as aforetime. Results are too easily gauged. Rand-
wick barrackers, by the way, have increased tenfold, and
monopolise the city on Saturday nights. They want the
whole arena and most of the reserved seats. A boss club
has the most barrackers. Always whoop for the top pup.
* * « *
Saturday’s swell football function, Randwick v.
University, excited little enthusiasm, the play being
monotonously commonplace. The forwards of both
tackled excellently', and the dashing backs shivered ex-
pectantly waiting for chances that seldom came. Con-
sequently', the hideous yells that greet the streaky fire-
brigade run 3 of a spririting-god weren’t as frequent as
usual. The U’s played strongly in the first term, but got
waterlogged afterwards, and Randwicks beat them
decisively—lB to 0. The winners, for whom Henlen
got three tries, missed three goal-kicking chances, too, a
couple of the shots going dangerously close to the exact
location. The U’s played without two of their principal
men—knocked out the previous week. Rugby would be
much safer, perhaps, if played with horse-pistols as s
guard against accident.

A Sea Captain’s Story.
What a Grand Old Sailor Told a Press
Reporter.
What He Has Seen and Found in Nearly
Every Port oe the Globe, and the
Value He Has Received.
I met a happy old sea captain at the wharf yester-
day, and had a pleasant and profitable conversa-
tion with him. I think he had travelled to all
quarters of the globe, for he mentioned Sitka,
Stockholm, Rio Janeiro, London, and South
Africa, in addition to all the principal seaport
cities of the world.
If one wanted to find a healthy, ruddy specimen
of humanity, this captain furnished it to such an
extent that I remarked about it. He laughed,
and said :
‘ ‘ But you should have seen me a number oi
years ago. Why even a pale-faced cabin-boy
looked healthy compared to me then. Command-
ing a ship is no easy task, and I suffered from
rheumatism, debility, and, it seemed to me, many
of the ills we hear so much about. I won’t tell
you all the details, but I will say that for the last
nine years I have been not only healthy, but
robust. I believe it is all due to one cause ”
Naturally I was interested, and urged him to
tell me his secret. Speaking very deliberately, he
said :
“ I have found that by care, and the use of just
the right thing, I can preserve my health and pro-
long my life almost indefinitely. Indeed, I think
I have discovered the secret. No matter where I
go, I carry it with me, and I tell you that in what-
ever port I stop, I can always find it. Do you ask
me what it is ? I will tell you : Warner’s ‘ Safe’
Cure—nothing else. I have purchased it in the
Mediterranean, in Australia, in England, in
America, in South Africa, in Bombay, and, in
fact, in every quarter of the globe, so it must be
that people all over the world are learning, as I
have learned, how valuable it is. Now don’t think
I am telling you this to advertise the medicine,
for I don’t know the people who make it, and,
indeed, don’t know what it is made of, but I do
know that for broken down men and weak women,
it is the grandest discovery of modern times, and
I don’t hesitate to say so. ”
I left the old captain, whose ship was about to
sail, much impressed by his sincerity and earnest-
ness. Certainly he is a living sample of what the
world calls health, and hence what most of us con-
sider happiness.*

POINTS
“Toby” Barton, it is again whispered,
may lead N.S.W. Protectionists to the poll on
next appeal to the people. Ranks at present
divided will, it is assumed, close up at his magic
call.
Bent’s South Melb. voters were (pathetic
gratitude !) mostly railway laborers, because, as
Minister of Railways, he had stuck out for six-
pence a day extra in their pay. Men knocked off
work to go and vote for him.
‘ ‘ Scotty the Wrinkler’s ” proposal to tax the
Chinaman’s employer instead of the Chinaman
himself is not so impracticable as may appear at
first sight. In England the employer of every
male servant has to pay a tax of 15s. per annum.
Premier Turner, who drew up and passed
the Vic. Income Tax Act, sent in his own tax
schedule early, and had it promptly returned to
him with a demand for “ further particulars.”
Even the man who makes a law seldom really
knows what is in it.
Grrown-up men in the employ of Vic. Rail-
way Department get 2s. 6d. a day for 5J days a
week. Government explains that they do boy’s
work. And boys do men’s work for something
less, no doubt. Will the Government strangle the
sweater —will it suicide ?
A Potts Point admirer of the ways of a
political Providence notes that by the re-election
the other day of Jenkin Coles to the S. Australian
Speakership the three provinces of Australia with-
out titled Premiers —N.S.W., S.A., and Vic.—are
blessed with titled Speakers.
The Late Judge BUCKLEY, of M.L.

Brewer N. Fitzgerald, M.L.C. (Vic.) told
A meeting of R.C. young men the other evening
that the goal of their ambition should be—the
Legislative Council! Some men are born Fat-
headed ; some achieve Fatheadedness ; but few
have Fatheadedness thrust upon them in this bare-
faced fashion.
Coincidence. When Murray Smith was
Vic. Agent-General he had once to officially deny
the late Lord Lamington’s assertion that in Vic-
toria black labor had reached the extent of slavery.
Kow Lamington’s son, the present lord, is
Governor of that Australian province where black
labor actually is slavery.
“ There is no demand for land was the
Maoriland Tory-partv’s constant reason for op-
posing the Seddon Government’s scheme of cutting
up big estates for settlement. The other day one
of the resumed estates near Oamaru was offered
in 64 allotments, and 8000 applications were lodged
—125 for each allotment.
Most of the Bananaland Labor organs have
successfully sent an editor as candidate for Parlia-
ment Noticing which fact, defeated candidates
(in Gym pie, Cairns, &c.) are busy starting, Labor
papers to work up enthusiasm for future con-
tingencies. The Radical press up North is the
best stepping-stone into the Legislature.
The most remarkable curiosity in North
Queensland at present is the Bowen railway. In
April, ’95, this line earned .£37 15s. sd. ; in April
last the receipts reached the magnificent sum total
of 19s. 6d. Consequently, the Bowemtes are
agitating furiously for an extension—probably to
catch the whale-trade in the Never-Never.
The Reid Ministry faces Bung zigzagly
thus —Six members of the Government will vote
for Local Option without compensation. If com-
pensation be conceded, seven members will vote
for it. Two members are flatly opposed to Local
Option without compensation, but are only
theoretically opposed to it if compensation be con-
ceded and if Local Option on this basis be carried
these will then go for such ponderous compensation
as will render the measure nugatory. Local
Option or no Local Option stands, therefore as 7
to 2 • Compensation or No Compensation as 3 to b.
It is interesting, in connection with the
miscellany of legal findings and assumptions in the
Mercadool and other land cases, still pending in
N.S.W. Law courts, to note that, since the
Robertson Land Act of 1861, only one person has
been sent to gaol for dummying, and that indi-
vidual was found guilty because he himself con-
fessed.
A State school-teacher who keeps bees is
not allowed to sell any of the honey, as that would
be competing with the professional beekeeper. A
policeman whose wife keeps hens is not allowed to
sell any of the eggs, as that would be competing
with the professional poultry-keeper. And yet,
under the same civilised Government, an Attorney-
General who is paid =61820 a year is allowed to do
as much private law business as he likes.
Lothaire, the Belgian officer alleged
(by the British) to have cold - bloodedly
murdered a British trader in the Congo,
has received a tremendous reception from ap-
plauding multitudes in Belgium. And the
Englishmen who are wildly applauding Jameson
for unlawfully butchering certain Dutchmen in
South Africa, complain bitterly about this “un-
friendly act,” and think that something should be
done.
It was plausibly pleaded by certain Parlia-
mentary hangers-on of the Sydney daily press that
the reason why the papers suppressed all report of
the application to N.S.W. Full Court for a
summons against the management of Tooth and
Co., brewers, was that it was unusual to report
ex-parte proceedings. Which excuse contained
not even half the truth. The last application of
the sort (the well-known case “ ex-parte M‘Kay”)
was at once reported in full by S.M. Herald.
As a sample of the inherent crookedness
of party-government: the N.S.W. Ministry would
have been beaten by at least four votes, the other
night, over Labor-member Hughes’s motion of ad-
journment re the non-issue of a summons against
Tooth & Co., the big Sydney brewers, charged by
an informer with defrauding the revenue, had not
the Opposition refused to touch the matter, on the
ground that it wasn’t going to minister to the
Solidarity Labor-party, by whom the motion was
practically, though not avowedly, fathered.
The decision of the N.S.W. Ministry to
fix a date for the release of the surviving Mt. Rennie
prisoners is probably, in some measure, intended
to make things nice and pleasant at the present
juncture for Judge Windeyer, whose appointment
to the Privy Council the Ministry is engineering.
r public has no more memory than a mud-
Vrtle: the Judge’s friends reckon that with the
release of the survivors recollection of the “ trial ”
will fade, and all will be harmonious. When
one considers the relations publicly existent
between Judge Windeyer and Premier Reid when
the latter was at the Bar, the conclusion is
irresistible that the Premier is afnost conciliatory
person.
N.S.W. Premier Reid badly
wants to get in the income-tax in time
to square this year’s financial state-
ment, so the department, in its tax-
paper, demands the money on or before
June 25, with an intimation that “for
neglect to pay tax-payers will incur a
fine of 2s. in the £.” The Act gives 60
days grace beyond the date mentioned,
so that the fine doesn’t begin till Aug
24, but this fact is judiciously left out.
Meanwhile, the Premier lof-
tily observes that it really
doesn’t matter whether any of
the money comes in this year
or not, as the finances will
square without it, and consid-
ering that the “ cash basis ”
man has just charged back
A 900 .000 of his expenditure to
previous years it seems quite
probable that it will. When
one remembers how G. Reid
squared his accounts before
by charging some hundreds
of thousands of ordinary road
and bridge repairs back to his
predecessor, on the ground
that Dibbs ought to have spent
more money than he did, and
put nearly J 1400,000 of loan-
money into revenue because
his predecessors had been pay-
ing things out of revenue
which, he alleged, they ought
to have charged to loans, it
looks as if he could square
anything.
N.S.W. Custom House law-
needs the immediate attention of
Parliament. Imputed fraud on any
other public department may be car-
ried straight to a public law-court, but
in the case of the Customs a tribunal
may sit in secret and prevent an alleged
imposition being threshed out by legal
process. It may also, and has done so
lately in respect of charges against
import jewellers, determine, sitting in
secret, to accept a fine from accused
persons in lieu of remitting the accusa-
tions to the criminal court. In the
light of the present day things like
these can be defended on no ground of
equity or expediency.
The N.S.W. Labor-party stands at the
parting of the ways, and can now either impreg-
nably entrench itself as the champion of equal
justice to all citizens or indelibly brand itself as a
mere aggregation of blithering pay-seekers. If it
refrains from insisting that the charges of fraud
made against Tooth and Co. be heard and disposed
of in open court, it deserves to be summarily extin-
guished by the electors.
Mr. Alex. Sutherland, lecturing Melb.
Reform Club on “ The Share that Goes to Brains,
demonstrates that the worker is already too well
paid, since brains are responsible for the largest
share of production. But does that share go to
brains ? Does the monopolist represent brains ?
Does the landlord ? Do one in ten of the wealthy
represent anything but fat and greed ? The Tories
make the mistake of confounding brains and mere
paunch, and claim the former’s share on top of all
else they can extort or steal.
One reason advanced
why the proposed Syd-
ney railway - extension
should be on the east
side of George-street with
a terminus at King-
street, instead of along
the w T est side—where d
would be conveniently
situated for further ex-
tension across the harbor
when circumstances
justify the building of a
bridge—is that in the
former case Hyde Park
could be used as the site
of the new terminus,
whereas in the latter a
site would have to be
purchased at great ex-
pense. But this isn’t
strictly logical. If the
city is to lose Hyde
Park, it matters very
little whether it is used
as a site for a station
or whether it is sold for
building-purposes and a
site in the vicinity of,
say, Wynyard - Square
bought with the
money. The loss is the
same in either case, and
the Park isn’t an argu-
ment one way or the
other.
In connection with the Tooth and Co.
brewery hubble-bubble, N.S.W. Assembly dis-
tinctly demonstrated that when its talkers get on
to the subject of beer, there is no question under
the sun that they do not consider relevant to the
issue. Quite right. Beer embraces all human lile
and human interests, all weal, all woe, all joy, a
iniquity. But beer was made to be drunk, ana
not talked about. Beer was made to be drunk by
man, and man was made to be drunk with beer.
Let us leave beer alone —in speech, thougrv our
tongues and throats lave lovingly in it. or beer
is art, science, theology, psychology, literature,
music, dynamics, philology, philosophy, me a-
physics, history, medicine, numismatics, pnilace y
and delirium tremens.
HE MEANT IT.
HE: “ Since you refuse to marry me, I refuse to live.”
SHE: “ Manly?”
HE: “No! Football !”
The scandal arising out of tacit or other
interference by Government with the discretion of
the police magistracy has now reached such a point
in Australia that the day is not far distant when
stipendiary magistrates will be placed by Parlia-
ment on as independent a footing as the Supreme
Court bench. A complement of this reform will
be the abolition of the Attorney-Generalship as a
political office.
N.S.W. Treasurer Reid predicts a con-
siderable surplus for the year ending June 30. Ile
also states that over £900,000 of the expenditure
has been charged back to previous years. Isn t
this the same Reid who was going to abolish the
misleading and confused practice of charging ex-
penditure back to former years, and put things
on a simple “cash basis,” so that it would be
really possible to know how the accounts stood .
Nothing has been heard about that famous cash
basis ” for quite a long time now.
A TRULY BRITISH IDEA OF THE UNEMPLOYED.
“Pm sorry I can’t help you, my man; I’m sure it must be very hard
to live.”
“It ain’t the living, sir, ’cos the wife washes—it’s the little lux’nes we
misses !”
Fearsome Bananaland ! The rabbits are all
over the South-west; the ticks are raging in the
North ; the caterpillar is devastating the centre ;
the Jap is descending on the coast towns ; the
men of Malayta have just made a fresh outbreak,
as prelude, apparently, to a cannibal feast; and,
over all, there lies the joyous shadow of the Boodle-
wraith !
Sydney Daily Telegraph —a Pharisee of
the Pharisees of Foreign-trade—is actually seri-
ously discussing the details of a possible British
Imperial Zollverein ; is admitting into its ques-
tions of “ practical politics ” the issues of differen-
tial and preferential tariffs —in other words, of
Protectionism. Is this the first quiver of a coming
wobble ? The very same issue of the paper speaks
feelingly about “those considerations of oppor-
tunism and expediency which are the first lessons
that the practical lawmaker has to learn.” Hand
over the “ Rontgen-rays ” machine, and view ’bus-
boss Carey (the D.T. chairman) as a convert
to communistic socialism.
The Bulletin advises every N.S.W. elec-
tor to read in Hansard the clear, logical and tem-
perate speech of Hughes, M.P., in stating the
alleged case of fraud against Tooth and Co., of
Sydney, and to contrast with it the flabby irrele-
vancies of Premier Reid —representative in the
Assembly, by the way, of the liquor-interests of
East Sydney. As all details of this most startling
affair have, for whatever reason, been kept dark by
the Sydney daily press, it is essential that the
Tooth case should be read up by that section of
the public which labors under the delusion that
N.S.W. at last possesses an impartial Govern-
ment.

A newly-admitted solicitor has forwarded
by post a photo, of himself, with “ Yours truly to
command ” underneath, to most of the mercantile
houses of Sydney.
Speaker Abbott has now held N.S.W.
chair for five years, thus tieing with Daniel
Cooper in duration of office. Wigram Allen, how-
ever, scored seven, and Arnold nine years.
Among the many bills sent in to a suc-
cessful candidate at last Q. election was one from
a man who claimed compensation for being
“ enthusiastic ” at the meetings of the aforesaid
candidate.
A Sydney Domain orator assured his au-
dience on Sunday that three N.S.W. Ministers of
the Crown have had their matrimonial affairs
adjusted by the local Divorce Court, sitting in
camera.
The veteran journalist, John Ferguson,
of Parramatta, has gone to Parramatta Gaol for
four months for a severe and stupid Little-Ped-
lingtonian libel on an alderman and Jaypee. The
air of “ the historic borough ” conduces to things
of this sort.
Because Griffith, C.J., has codified a
number of statutes, admiring claqueurs have begun
to call him the “ Queensland Higinbotham.” It
takes more to make a Higinbotham than mere
index-compiling.
On June 13 Mr. and Mrs. Ephraim Close
celebrated their Diamond wedding, having been
married at Scots Church, Church Hill, Sydney, 60
years ago, by Parson M‘Garvie, a colleague of old
John Dunmore Lang.
Sir William Harcourt recently described
young Tom Brassey—expected out here shortly
with Lady Idina Brassey—as “ a chip of the old
block.” Which implied that, in Sir Historicus’s
opinion, papa Brassey is wooden. Good !
The latest Sydney clisnaru has, up to date,
quite outwitted the detectives, who believe him to
be lying low somewhere in town. Several exten-
sive forgeries, which have hit Ikey Mo under the
fifth rib, are alleged against the gentleman.
Both Gov. Buxton’s daughters are now
engaged, the second to the dapper-looking pri vate-

lately-deceased S.A. squatter, Geo. Hawker.
At a recent dinner to one of his party,
Premier Kingston recited “Who Fears to Speak
of ’9B ? ” But the local scribes put it down as
“ Who Dares to Speak of ’98,” and the West Ade-
laide bhoys are wondering “what has come over
Charlie ? ”
To be pasted in the hats of Lord Hamp-
den, Primate Smith, and the Sydney Charity Or-
ganisation Society :
Careless their merits or their faults to scan,

Hercules Robinson, now in trouble over
the Transvaal raid, was the first Australian
Governor to notably forward the cause of Federa-
tion by his public speeches. To his harangues on
the theme may also be attributed Albury’s belief
that Nature intended it to be the seat of Parlia-
ment in the new nation. Robinson, it would
appear, looked on the Transvaal as another Fiji.
Englishmen threw Fiji into disorder, and set up
old chief Thakombau as king, but gradually
worked affairs around till the islands were ready
for Robinson to annex. But that was a quarter
of a century ago, and Boers aren’t Fijians.
A new Dan O’Con-
nor story. The “Jay-
nial ” was a guest at an
up-country banquet, and
one of the speech-makers
alluded to him as the
“ Demosthenes of the
N.S.W. Assembly.”
Later on, Daniel was
down for an oration, and
the chairman, evidently
thinking that the ex-
P.M.G. had got another
Crown billet, craved si-
lence for “Mr. O’Connor,
Demosthenes av’ th’ As-
simbly ! ”
When the Deeming
excitement was at its
highest a Melb. news-
paper-man fired in two
columns of exclusive copy
which he had managed
to worm out of a certain
attorney and a couple of
others in the course of
dinner attheVienna Cafe.
Next pay-day he accord-
ingly placed in his list of
expenses the item “ Cost
of dinner (in obtaining
Deeming information),
145.,” and submitted the
account to the leader of
the staff. “ Great Scott!”
yelled that functionary,
drawing a red - ink line
through the 14s. ; “were
there 14 of you ? ”
The rule of precedence at public functions,
drawn up and signed by Card. Moran and Primate
Smith on their own behalf and as a guide to their
successors, is that the ecclesiastical dignitary,
whether C.E. or R.C., who has resided longest in
Australia goes up top.
Veteran James Smith of the Argus is
announced to lecture at Melb. Working Men’s
College on the “ Usefulness of New Ideas.” This,
from an Argus leader-writer, is simply barefaced.
Mr. Smith will presently be regarded in the office
as a most dangerous man.
Australia’s richest woman, it is announced,
will shortly marry Mr. Desmond Richardson, a
Victorian gentleman. Which would seem to
effectually dispose of the rumor that the lady,
who takes much interest in church and missionary
matters, was inclined to smile on the alleged suit
of a gartered personage adored of cabbies.
Zox, of the waistcoat, at Vic. Artists’
Society the other night, suggested that each artist
in Australia should paint a picture commemora-
tive of the 60th year of Queen Victoria’s reign,
and send it to Windsor Palace in 1897 as a present
to H.M. And yet Zox pretends to be a loyal
citizen.
Louis Becke left per s.s. Parramatta for
England, with a view to improving the market
for his literary wares. He has ready a volume of
characteristic South Sea stories, but does not pur-
pose publishing them before next year. Mean-
while, he will work for the magazines, and con-
tribute to The Bulletin. The Saturday Review
publishes a column and a-half notice warmly
eulogising his “Ebbing of the Tide.”
“Blue Ribbon” Clarke, of
Brisbane has been defying a Q.
Royal Commission to drag him to
give evidence. It would be inter-
esting to watch the Commission’s
myrmidons trying to skulldrag
the bald-getting, long-legged left-
handed (Clarke is left-
handed in everything but
carving), ropable, Gospel-
temperance lecturer. The
writer once saw a wicked-
looking, muscular, color-
ed gentleman, a Tem-
perance “ brother,” try
conclusions with the bony
John A. C. The nigger
was “on the bounce,”
and had a reputation as
dark as his skin for his
supposed fistic abilities.
He sailed in. The apos-
tle of Gospel-temperance
met him more than half-
way, and landed him one
with his left [his right)
that sent him fairly
across a moderately-
sized office and bang
against the door - (the
darkie had closed the
door in order to prevent
Clarke from running
when the ebony circus
was started !)—met him
on the rebound with “ the other right,”
and “ chasseed ” him into dizziness before the
writer had time to get into a safe corner
from which to look on. Weak and trembling with
fear, the nigger turned to go. “ No, you don’t ! ”
said the long mail of anti-beer, as he strode to the
door; “first of'all apologise, and then pay up ! ”
“I will, Mister Clarke, I will,” whimpered the
quite tamed negro—a full-blooded bully lie was,
too, and married to a fine white woman—“l will,
but, by Ga a d ! I thought you was a man of Gawd ! ”
—Dipso.
The valuable old newspapers that have
mysteriously disappeared from Melbourne Public
Library included the story of the late James B.
Patterson’s little cattle-trouble. And the S.M.
Herald file reporting the Mt. Rennie trial has
gone from Sydney School of Arts.
Canon Potter utters a dyspeptic wail about
Democracy in Melbourne, evidently after a dive
into historian Becky’s big book. Two Potters at
it at one time, said a would-be wit —a pretty one
at the Princess’s in “ As You Like It,” and a
dull one at St. Paul’s in “ As You Lecky It.”

chants. The Chosen are nowadays found chasing
royalty in every direction. How long before
Hebrews marry into the reigning families, and
kings shall be known by their noses ?
B. R. Wise is said to have found a number
of sensational letters among the Parkes papers com-
mitted to his trust. Purcell’s revelations concern-
ing Manning are mild tilings compared with what
some of the documents tell of Parkes. And several
high-headed people who passed as the warmest
friends of politician Reid were, it seems, all the
time secretly informing Parkes by letter that the
little man was only fit to run a lollie-shop. If
Wise would resist the temptation to edit, and just
print the lot as it comes to hand, N.S.W. politics
would be lively for quite a long time.

The Bulletin has said before—or, if it
hasn’t, it should have said—that there is a fortune
awaiting the compiler and publisher of Youliana.
One of the latest ana :
The Coroner (Youll) remarked that the woman should
have been tapped. He knew of a man who had had quarts
of fluid taken from his lungs, and the same night that
man had danced in a pantomime. (Laughter).
Mr. Corr : But what became of the man the day after ?
The Coroner : He’s alive to-day. He makes a noise at
the back of my house, and I wish he was dead.
Hideously funny picture ! An escaped subject of
Dr. Youll making night horrible for the person
who intended to dissect him and make humorous
comments upon his anatomical structure !
In Franklin’s life it is stated that Disraeli
once thought of visiting Australia. This was, of
course, long before the gold-discoveries which first
made the existence of Australia known to the mass
of Englishmen. Up to the gold-epoch, the average
conception of these countries was scarcely more
intelligent than that of Castlereagh, who took Gov.
Macquarie to task for not building a bridge over
Bass Straits.
The late “Tarbrush” Woods, of Yic.
railway fame, was a terrible dyspeptic, and abso-
lutely detested seeing anybody enjoy himself at
table. At a banquet in Rochester a local gour-
mand who sat near the Minister and had been
vigorously stoking himself was asked by a waiter
“Can I bring you anything else, sir?” Where-
upon the disgusted and curious Woods chipped in
with : “Yes, bring the a bran-mash.”
Saturday Review on Rolf Boldrewood’s
atest: —-
Here is a man with a vast island-continent at his call,
so to speak, for material, and for the major portion of the
book we are shut up with a few ordinary, middle-class
English people in a drawing-room of unmistakeably sub-
urban origin—“ dado,” “ Erard grand,” and “ half-exe-
cuted needlework.” Meanwhile, no doubt, suburban
novelists are hard at work making Australian local color.
The continent at Boldrewood’s “ beck ” and call
seems almost satirical. The Saturday should
really have added the final “e.”
Charles Gavan Duffy, who for 15 years has
lived at Nice, enjoying his £lOOO a year Victorian
pension, lately celebrated his 80th birthday.
Although the most delicate in health, he has out-
lived all his political compeers of 1844 and ’4B ex-
cepting one, Dr. Kevin Izod O’Doherty, of Queens-
land. Of the first Ministry which he joined in
Victoria (1857), but J. D. Wood remains; of the
second Ministry (’5B), all but Duffy are dead, and
of the third (O’Shannassy Govt., ’6l), but three
others remain—J. D. Wood, J. S. Johnston, and
Duffy.
Old Coroner Youl, the Melb. humorist,
waxes especially funny at the expense of the ac-
complished Dr. Mullen, who is generally under-
stood to be waiting for the veteran’s shoes.
Mullen has doubly qualified himself by becoming
a lawyer as well as a medicine man, and when he
heard a whisper that Youl’s successor would be
chosen from the Civil-service he took a Govern-
ment appointment at some small infirmary, or
asylum, in order to be more qualified than ever.
Whereupon the reigning coroner was chaffed by his
friends. They wanted to know how he could hope
to defeat the watchful Mullen’s purpose after
that. “ I’ll outlive him,” said Youl. The grand
old man, it seems, has a talent for outliving every-
one who calculates on his decease. “And, as a
rule,” says he, “ I hold an inquest on ’em.”
J. C. F. Johnson is at present a howling
swell in London, where he has just sold a .£lOO,OOO
Westralian gold-mine. He presided over the
“gold-grabbers’” table at the anniversary lun-
cheon of the Colonial Institute. About 20 years
ago J.C.F.J. was on the wallaby in S.A. His
first billet in S.A. Register office, in the publish-
ing department, is» said to have been worth quite
15 bob a week. Then the energetic one wormed
in as a reporter, the “shows” being his specialty.
He is a good amateur conjuror and knows a
wizardy secret or two in the matter of optical
illusions—ghosts, “Fatimas,” levitated humans,
&c. He ran one or two small specs, of the kind
in Adelaide, as side-shows to Adelaide Punch, of
which he became proprietor. The story of his
first rise in connection with gold-mining is quite
a dramatic tale of a prospector’s gratitude.
Poor old “Billy” Pattison,” of Mount
Morgan, is dead. Pattison was a peaceful butcher
at Rockhampton when his ill-luck led him into the
golden Mount and he became a millionaire. Then
he went into Parliament, and all manner of people
lived on the well-meaning meat-man, and let him
into all manner of splendid speculations, and the
result was that after a brief spell of magnificence
he came back to his former haunts as poor
as before Mount Morgan began. Also, he came
back older, disillusioned, worn out with politics
and with the constant struggle to keep himself
from being cleaned out by politicians, loaded
with dishonored bills and bad I O U’s, and partly
paralysed. Indirectly it would seem that the
golden mount killed Pattison, who was a decent
old man and deserved better luck.
Captain Russell, leader of the Tory Oppo-
sition-party in Maoriland Parliament, complains
bitterly that things “ain’t what they was.” When
he first arrived in the province in ’5B, as a young
officer of the army, said the venerable politician
recently, men depended on themselves ; “ but the
old self-reliance has departed, giving place to
dependence on Government.” Whereupon some
one unkindly points out that in these days a mili-
tary officer, after five years’ residence, was entitled
to a free grant of 400 acres ; but that Russell, after
only three and a-half years’ residence, howled so
bitterly outside Parliament House for a special
grant that an Act was passed giving him 800
acres gratis. Also that his father, then a politi-
cian who had also grabbed much land gratis, voted
for the measure and shoved it through the nominee
Legislature with much vim. Australasia owes
a big debt to the pioneers who came here
in the old, wicked, roaring days, and took
the land for nothing, and borrowed the money
to open it up with roads and railways and
harbors, and left the present generation to wrestle
with the bill for these improvements to the old
Captain RUSSELL, Leader of the M.L-
Opposition against the Seddon Govt.

men’s property. And now the survivors of these
pioneers put on airs of superiority about their
self-reliance, and ask the people of to-day—who
are engaged struggling with the bill aforesaid-
why they don’t do likewise. There were some
valuable men among the old identities, but the
best thing aUcut the great majority of them is
that they are dead and seem likely to remain so.
Their deadness, in most cases, deserves the warm-
est encouragement.


The Queensland deer on Maryvale and
Cressbrook don’t increase very fast. The indis-
criminate “ sport ” is their worst foe ; then comes
the eagle-hawk, which attacks the fawns; and,
lastly, the native dog, which finds venison an ex-
cellent substitute for kangaroo.

REPORT ON THE PROPERTY BY MR. H.
S. MUIR.
Mount Lyell,
Tasmania, May 23, 1896.
The Chairman and Directors of the “ North Mount
Lyell Mining Company.”
Gentlemen, —
Having had the opportunity during the past two
years of thoroughly examining the progressive
prospecting work at the North Mount Lyell mine,
and also its surface indications in relation to other
surrounding mines, I now have the pleasure of
supplying you with the following particulars of
development made since the mine has been opened,
and inferences that may reasonably be drawn
from the data at hand and the developments of the
field generally.
SITUATION, &c.
The North Mount Lyell property consists of
three 10-acre blocks held under gold lease (which
embraces all other minerals), numbered 23/90,
29/90, and 30/90, being situated on the southern
slope of Mount Lyell, and the eastern slope of the
ridge between Mounts “Lyell” and “Owen.”
The general fall of the ground being from the west
to the east, it will be seen that the property is
adapted for working by adit levels, which is of
great importance for economical mining.
SURFACE, &c.
At about the centre of the property, and travers-
ing sections 23/90 and 29/90, occurs a formation of
barytic “hematite” and “quartzite,” which
marks the course of the metalliferous ore belt
underlying to the west. This hematite and
quartzite outcrop usually lays on a conglomerate
deposit, which forms the footwall of the ore
bodies.
The strike of this lode through sections 23/90 and
29/90 is west of north over the whole distance, but
subject to sharp deviations. The rock outcrop to
the west of this hematite lode is an iron-stained
schist, and is the locale where pyrites ore veins
will be found, therefore the whole of the property
is so positioned that the lode is contained well
within it. .
From the intersection of the hematite with the
gullies and following the natural fall of the country
east can be found alluvial deposits of gravel
carrying gold and copper, also large deposits of
pug on the course of the creeks, containing native
copper (leached from the lodes) is added evidence
of the extent of the ore bodies that will be found
in the development of the mine.
ORE OUTCROPS.
On section 29/90 an outcrop of dense copper
pyrites (contained in schist) has been trenched on
in various places, and to prospect this a tunnel
was started on section 23/90 to intersect the ore
body.
At 200 ft. in from opening an ore body (crubes-
cite) of high grade, corresponding with that on
surface, was passed through, its strike being to
east of north. This important development occur-
ring in soft ground has not been further explored.
The surrounding country being of a swelling
nature, it has been left for future prospecting.
UNDERGROUND WORKINGS.
The underground workings consist of a main
tunnel 420 ft. in length, passing through mostly
Prospectus.
broken country. From the head of main tunnel a
western crosscut (220 ft.) intersects the stratified
schists, showing them to be highly mineralised.
A south drive off western crosscut, commencing
82ft. from end of main tunnel, has been following
a body of copper pyrites and erubescite. This
drive follows the footwall of the ore formation for
about 70ft., and is most likely a portion of the
main “ ore body,” marked on surface by the hema-
tite.
A “winze” being put down in the ore body
near the footwall is opening up well, showing a
marked improvement in every foot of sinking,
some veins being very rich. The value and appear-
ance of the ore to-day at this level is highly satis-
factory, being only 120 ft. beneath the natural
surface.
Taking the rock formations covering the surface,
together with the development underground, it
proves that the metalliferous lodes exist at the
junction of the “ conglomerate ” with the “schist”
rocks, mostly contained in the schist, and under-
lying west, also, that these lodes have been de-
nuded of their metals on the surface and to some
depth below, by natural leaching, the lost product
being found at a lower level in the pug deposit in
the form of native copper. It will at once be seen
the importance of intersecting the lode at a depth
where it may safely be assumed ore will be found
of higher value and intact.
As the mine is situated so that fairly deep pro-
specting can be got by adit, it may be expected
that large bodies of payable ore will be met with
as the mine is opened up by this means. The
underground workings having already proved the
existence of payable ore at the level now being
explored, it now requires greater depth (which can
be got by adit) to further determine the extent and
quality of the lode', and from evidence deduced
from immediate surroundings and the workings of
other mines it suggests that considerable improve-
ment in size and quality will be found than that
existing in the upper levels.
I am, gentleman,
Yours faithfully,
H. S. MUIR,
Manager Mount Lyell Extended

CONSULTING ENGINEERS.
Messrs. J. Wildridge and Sinclair, Consulting and
Refrigerating Engineers.
It is proposed to form a company for the purpose of
erecting cold storage works at Fremantle, Western Aus-
tralia, and suitable inland mining centres, and providing
regular supplies of cattle, sheep, beef, mutton, poultry,
dairy produce, fish, &c., in Western Australia, and, if
thought desirable, to hereinafter extend the operations of
the company to other Australian colonies. Powerful ice-
making machinery will be worked in conjunction with
the cold-storage depots. It is proposed that the main
depot shall be at Fremantle, from which smaller inland
depots will draw their requirements.
It is intended to erect works on the dry-air system. The
estimates of Messrs. Wildridge and Sinclair for the works
at Fremantle, including duplicate portions where advis-
able, with capacity for 10,000 sheep, or equivalent in
other products, and a daily output of
Eight tons ice is (*see footnote) £9,500
Works at Kalgoorlie, the present terminus
of the railway 1,500
Sites and contingencies 1,500
£12,500
This will leave a balance of £12,500, less preliminary ex-
penses for working-capital, &c.
*Note. —Alternative works for 15,000 sheep and 12 tons
ice, £14,000.
It is considered that for the present Sydney is the most
suitable port for the purchase and shipment of frozen
meat, the facilities in all respects being most convenient.
Satisfactory provisional arrangements have been made to
this end, which can be definitely concluded at any
moment; as also the provision of the necessary freight
tonnage should local steamers be unwilling to enter into
the trade.
It is well known that Western Australia cannot supply
its already large and rapidly-growing population with
suitable food requirements. The quality of the food at
the present time is very inferior. Already the import of
livestock is assuming large proportions, and it is con-
sidered very certain that with regular supplies of prime
quality always on hand this company can practically com-
mand a very considerable portion of the trade.
It is expected within a short time of the commencement
of operations to work into an output of at least 2500 sheep
per week, and an equivalent in beef or other meat, which,
at even a small profit per pound, will show a most ample
net return.
For poultry, fish, dairy produce, fruit, and other com-
modities a very large profit can be looked for, and from
the sale of ice a handsome income during the summer
months should result.
The promoters have sent gentlemen in whom they place
reliance to Western Australia, who have returned fully
assured that a good business can be done, and who are
satisfied with the arrangements of the Government for
cool carriage on the railways.
The Railway department already have on hand six
refrigerating cars, and 12 more are in course of construc-
tion.
The state of public feeling on the gold-fields points to
the removal at no distant date of the present duty of ljd.
per lb. on fresh meat. This would materially increase the
prospects of the company’s business.
The company has secured the pecuniary support and
co-operation of Messrs. Wildridge and Sinclair, electrical
engineers, Sydney, who have had large experience in the
frozen meat trade, and are willing to take a considerable
interest in shares of the company. The necessary
machinery can be landed and erected in ample time to
meet the coming summer’s requirements.
An agreements dated the 28th day of May, 1896, has
been entered into between the promoters on behalf of the
proposed company and Hurtle Morphett. This agreement
may be inspected at the offices of the solicitors.
Upon the formation of the company a meeting of
allottees of shares will be held in accordance with “ clause
17 of the Companies Act of 1892,” for the purpose of
adopting memorandum and articles of association, for the
election of directors, &c.
Dated at Adelaide this 20th day of May, 1896.

Legal Manager
(To be appointed by the shareholders.)
This company is being formed for the purpose
of purchasing and developing the valuable gold-
mining lease and machinery formerly owned by
the Monarch Company at Corindhap, Rokewood,
together with a first-class 10-head battery in course
of erection by the vendors.
The lease (No. 2405) contains an area of 29 acres
3 roods 30 perches, situate on the main French-
man’s lode, at Rokewood ; also an application for
another area of 25 acres to the east of the jjresent
lease, which, when granted, will be transferred to
the company.
The main shaft, on which the plant is erected,
is divided mto three compartments, sunk to a depth
of 208 ft., and a crosscut opened out to the west.
There is also a tunnel 330 ft. into the hill, from
which a good quantity of stone is obtainable. Two
known lodes traverse the property, from which
highly payable stone was obtained down to the
water-level, but further operations were hampered
owing to lack of capital and not having a battery
on the ground to treat the stone.
The machinery comprises a complete and power-
ful winding plant, capable of working to a depth
of 1500 ft., and the mine is well furnished with
trucks, cages, ropes, tanks, &c. ; also a good 10-
head battery with all necessary appertenances.
The whole of the plant is in perfect order, and has
been erected in a capable manner, with due regard
to economy in working.
The amount to be placed to the credit of the
company should provide funds sufficient to reach
the lode and open up the mine. It is not antici-
pated calls will be necessary ; in any case the calls
will not be heavy, the machinery being paid for,
and not much dead work to be done.
Early application for shares is necessary, as the
list will close immediately all the shares have been
applied for.
Applications for shares, accompanied with cash
or cheque, will be received by
BELL, LAMBERT, and Co., Sharebrokers.

The aquatic contest. Pirates v. Wallaroo, was a
better show than anticipated. Pirates started with a
dozen, and played three pick-ups. Even then, had their
backs shaped in style, they might have got closer. The
ground was suitable for a model-yacht race, and players
floundered about looking for the ball, which got lost
occasionally. It was reminiscent of wading through a
swamp after a wounded wild-duck. The marsupials won
by 11 lengths ; scores, 16 to 5.
» » * *
The Wentworth-Paddington match was got off
on a sliding-scale. The slippery ground being adverse to
hoof locomotion, pulling down, getting up, and mud-
munching at intervals occupied most of the time, and the
ball got more peace than is customary. Paddingtons,
strengthened somewhat, surprised everybody who, a week
previously, deemed them the veriest novices. The W’s.
only got over their line to score once. This they equalised,
but a free and a mark gave Wentworths the win by 10 to 3.

Melb. senior football clubs settlein to their premier-
ship positions. Undefeated Essendon leads Collingwood
by 4 points, others nowhere. South, third on the list,
was beaten, 6 goals to 4 goals, on Saturday, by Essendon,
Melb. and Ports also losing to Collingwood and N. Melb.
Fitzroy, on the improve, beat Geelong, 4 goals to 3 goals—
four sterling matches, and not one good crowd.
V.F. A., now in the throes of the professionalism
trouble, begins to see that the game is losing ground.
Committees are to be appointed to thresh out the payment
question, and also to devise means for making the game
more popular. Too late !
* * * *
Coolgardie papers give details of Sunday foot-
ball tussles controlled by the local association. The only
published complaint concerns the two-hour use of the
great Australian adjective in both its original and up-to-
date form. As Coolgardie is itself one huge curse the
item was probably shoved in to fill up space.
* * * *
Queensland Rugby authorities are searching the
province for the best talent available for *he trip to M.L.,
where they play seven matches, incl ding one against all
M.L. The selection will be the strong to. .aid heaviest yet
made, and bulky forwards are in demand. Three parti-
cularly fat Sandows are said to be playing at Charters
Towers, and one or two will likely be picked. The fatman
curse seems to pervade even football.
* * * •
Victorian football, in its boomtime, was cracked
up to be the perfection of all leather-kicking games. Now
that football is dropping out of favor with everybody save
the Collingwood and South Melbourne toughs, the high
priests hope to bolster it up with improvements. The
situation is pathetic.
* * * *
The milk in the football cocoanut. There are
11 lacrosse teams in Melb. and 14 in Adelaide. There is
only one junior football association in Adelaide, and as
fast as football clubs die their grounds are taken by
lacrosse clubs. When junior football declines, then comes
the beginning of the end.
* * * *
Various Sydney papers are now advocating the
electoral football scheme. Rather late in the day, but
early enough for next season. The possibility of the
Randwicks being “too good” for the rest, and the unlike-
lihood of the public paying to see “walkovers,” are now
troubling even the thick-headed Rugby Union. That
“ ground of their own ” and proposed ’97 ’Ome' trip doesn’t
look like realisation at present.

The alleged drowning of the champion will
arouse public interest in his go with Harding next month.
London papers, by jthe way, say that when the Hawkes-
bury giant arrived at his “diggings,” and was introduced
to his opponent, the latter, who gazed long and curiously,
looked like Jim’s little brother.
* * * *
One of Stanbury’s mates: “ Does the paper say
the body has been recovered?” “No.” “Well, then
Jim must have recovered it himself.” And so it proved.
• • • •
Now suggested that that boat-upsetting incident
was planned as a protest against the monopoly of the
cable by the joyful travelling cricketers to the exclusion
of the other Australians—Stan bury, Paris 111. and Gollan’s
horses.
* * * *
Wray, who accompanied Stanbury to England
as trainer, ought to be about good enough to put down
Harding on his own account. So think a number of
Sydney oarsmen, who won’t be surprised to see him try.

The unconvinced Clarence River choppers put
up their cash royally, the other day, for a second tilt at
M'Pherson (Tas.). They parted without a murmur. Cur-
ran, varying the style exhibited when he lost the cham-
pionship, chopped Mac. for £25. Mac. won. Then
M’Lennon and Dwyer sawed M‘Pherson and Moore (Tas.)
for a tenner, and the latter had the cash won before their
opponents were half through. Not content, Dwyer put
up a stake for a standing-tree match, M’Pherson romping
in by lengths. The Tas. champion is now prepared to
“ wrastle ” wood with any man m the world, three styles
or mixed.
* * * *
Favorite Dart, carrying 12st., was far and away
the best of the seven saddled for Y.R.C. Steeple on Satur-
day. The poverty of the field, so far as good ’uns went,
was due to obvious causes —disinclination to show an early
hand before the appearance of the G.N. weights being
one. The Millers are particularly susceptible to small
fish, but Dart on this occasion went down before Rorke’s
Drift, who had a 211 b. pull. If his leg stands, however,
Dart will likely win a good ’chase ere many weeks roll on.

The real truth about that little “ringin’’ up
Wodonga way is badly wanted. A city mare won a
double under a slightly-altered name, only her party’s
“ commissioner” being present. Her seemingly mythical
owner didn’t turn up even at the enquiry, when all three
were passed out. The “commissioner,” a known man,
now appeals on his own behalf, and if a bookie and a civil
servant are shivering in the background, as hinted, it’s to
be hoped they aren’t influential enough to stay further
proceedings.

“Tattersall” got off three sweeps over True

Adelaide ’chaser Banjo was an <£ll cast-off not

TheV.A.T.C. vainly believed that owners and
breeders would see them through with their rich First
Caulfield Futurity Stakes. The initial results are that
only 117 were nominated, whereas the club expected
nearly three times that total. So that the club will have
to stump up over £l5OO out of the £3OOO at the least. The
monetary conditions attached to the event appear to have
been too severe.
* * * *
Instead of fixing a <£so stake value for selling-
races, the A.J.C. should have wiped these smellful con-
tests out altogether. An event for bona-fide knock-kneed,
pigeon-toed butchers’ hacks would be much more interest-
ing, and provide better sport.
* * * *
Even a cursory glance at V.R.O. G.N. weights
furnishes a puzzling double-problem. A great many of
the entrants do not possess the requisite stamina, but as
the element of .luck enters largely into the question, that
doesn't always count. Also, the majority are one-pace
horses, and haven’t much chance in a go-all-the-way
gallop, especially when the fences are high, as on Flem-
fngton. Redleap has a winning chance in the hurdles
with 12st. 131 b., and, judging by the company he has to
keep, is not out of the steeple with the figures reversed.
But he is not worth discussing until one knows he’s
going:. His flat-racing proclivities have earned novice
Preston a startler in the hurdles, but Manifold’s string
appears to be justly dealt with in both events. One blot
in the big-timber race is Piritea’s 12st. The M.L. horse
might have had a chance with a stone and a-half less.
Mutiny also has too much, but he is a more brilliant
horse than his mate. On the whole, the Manifold stable
has a high chance of scooping the double.

When The Harvester showed a fine winning
front as a three-year-old, owner Cook had visions of a

won’t start this time.

Dunlop, inventor of the pneumatic bicycle-tyre,
less than 10 years ago, made a stroke more generally ap-
preciated than any discovery since the telephone. Yet he
has never ridden a bicycle to this day. He only accom-

son. Cros, the exploiter, rapidly swims up as top-dog
English millionaire.

There is nothing wonderful about sprinter
Hutchins’ defeat of cyclist Osborne at ’Ome over 100yds.
A flying ped. ought to romp in every time. He attains
top speed long before his opponent (not allowed a shove-
off) gets under weigh. Hutchins was 10yds. ahead at fifty,
and Osborne only gained 6yds. afterwards. Starting a
bike yourself is much slower than getting up steam on a
horse. The writer saw a champion ped. beaten twice by
a fast-beginning horse over 50yds. Confident of victory,
he lined up a third time. But the prad was a man-eater,
and, turning round, caressingly chewed his arm. The
ped. has never hankered after horse-matches since.

Full programmes of the pettiest race-meetings
are published in Melb. dailies to the disgust of ordinary
readers. Half-a-column devoted to lists of entries for
little £lO handicaps, whose top-weight wouldn’t fetch
much more than a “ tenner” at auction. Yet there must
be jugginses to keep these rag-tag and wrangle meetings
going.

The major club up N.Q. way has a bad pain in
its temper just now. Three defaulters were struck off for
life ; a bookie who swore at sundry punters was fined £5O;
the stiff brigade received seasonable consideration, and
an alleged pressman was disqualified for life from entering
any course in North Q. for using gutter language on
Queen’s Birthday. Stiff !
• * * *
The wholesale way in which Sydney papers
ladle out tips for the daily trumpery lilliputian flutters re-
gardless of whether the mokes are likely starters, triers,
or are in or out of form, prompts the idea that a set of
forecasts for each club is kept standing, and inserted with
periodical changes, advt. fashion, as occasion requires.
The tips seldom come off because the writers, who don’t
profess to be endowed with the Divine gift of sporting
prophecy in connection with swindles, have no special in-
formation on the subject, and select promiscuously, their
insidious advice being showered on a large number of in-
offensive people who have never done them any harm.
Pony fixtures receive as much attention as a Melb. Cup
carnival. Cause : the all-powerful advt., of which a
quarter-column of prognostications is the outcome. If
anyone gets his money’s worth out of the press it is the
private sport runner and Ikey Mo.

Mr. C. E. Greener, of the eminent gun firm,
returns to England in a few weeks’ time, and will take
with him the vivid memory of the two crimes perpetrated
against him in Australia. The Abrahams filched from
Mr. Greener his good name, and the Melb. lawyers helped
themselves to Mr. Greener’s purse. Australian law
allowed Mr. Greener to buy his own name back for £4OOO.
Mr. Greener, before leaving, has a few words for
Australian sportsmen : “ Remember that at 40yds. your
charge is stringing 15ft. and the bulk of the charge 10ft.
That is with an ordinarily good choke; shot from a
cylinder barrel strings 30ft. At 60yds. the shot has
dropped three feet below the height of your barrel—this,
perhaps, is why you missed the duck so often. Use the
best chilled shot—the velocity of the charge up the barrel
is as much as 1100 ft. a second—conclude how much the
compression will flatten softer pellets. The fulminate of
mercury in good cartridge caps, and the bichloride of
potash in cheaper makes—especially the latter, rusts your
gun to its deterioration. Therefore, after a day’s sport,
clean your gun as soon as possible, using turps or benzine.
Dry the barrel thoroughly, and then smear it inside and
out with rangoon oil. Greener guns won £7OO in prizes
alone at Monte Carlo last season.”

The poor, loyal, old S.M. Herald just now evi-
dently dunno where it are (writes a correspondent):—“ His
Ex. the Governor, accompanied by Capt. Sloane Stanley,
A.D.C., Captain the Hon. F. Egerton, A.D.C., and the
Hon. Gathorne Hardy, P.S., returned to Sydney by the
early morning train on Saturday from Mullengudgerv, on
the Western railway line, to which place they had gone
on a shooting excursion at the beginning of last week.
. . . Altogether, there were about 12 guns in the
party, and very good sport was obtained, chiefly duck and
wild turkey, of which a large number were bagged. . . .
The experience was a novel and enjoyable one, and his
Excellency was very much pleased with the expedi-
tion.” All that is needed to complete his Ex-
cellency’s pleasure is a police prosecution against
himself and “shoot” for killing native game
out of season. (It isn’t out of season, but Tire Bulletin
hasn’t the heart to spoil a good par.) Why, it’s levy and
distress to be found with a 4oz. teal in one’s pos-
session at this time of the year (or it would be if
this was the close season, which for the pur-
poses of this paragraph it really ought to be).
Further down the Herald’s paragraph “ Last even-
ing a small dinner-party was given at Government
House, the guests being Mrs. Brough, Mr. Boucicault, the
Hon. Rupert and Mrs. Carington, Mr. and Mrs. W. R.
Mitchell, and the members of the house party.”’ Which
causes one to wonder whether in the prosecution that
must now happen, the people who helped His Ex. to put
away the illegal game (we mean the game that might
have been illegal) will be held particeps criminis.
Cutting from police-report of next week : “ Florence
Brough, charged with eating at Guvmentouse ducks
shot on Mullengudgery during the close season, pleaded
guilty, and was fined £5.” (What a pity this isn’t the
close season!)
* * * *
From a monetary aspect Coolangatta stud-sale
was a disheartening fiasco. A “ century ” was the highest
figure reached, and the majority went back to the pad-
docks. Horses now-a-days don’t total much if they have
to go under the hammer.
* * * *
True Blue, Sydney’s most promising mainstay
in spring interj rovincial races, will be burnished up on
the Newcastle track, owner Hooke having an alleged
aversion to the Randwick tan. Which may be so, besides
there aren’t so many prying eyes up-country.
* * * *
The wisdom exercised by the A. J.O. in binding
proprietary clubs to a £4OO programme, instead of £350
as heretofore, will have due effect at a later stage, when
Sydney people get horse-sick and the boom bursts. A
£5O rise is a painful knock for the proprietaries, but that
doesn’t matter. It is to be hoped that the A.J.C. will
next year increase it to £450, or to any amount that will
ensure less racing, or knock half the clubs on the head
altogether. There is far too much horse sport in the
saddle-ridden metropolis, and compulsory high values is
one step towards reducing it. When the M.L. racing
conference a few years ago raised the added money all
round, puny clubs that weren’t required died on the spot.
And when the Govt, restricted tote licenses, others were
buried also. And still the cry, “Too much racing,” is
heard in the land.
* * * »
Now whispered that the alleged forestalling of a
certain stable awhile back was simply turfy moonshine.
When people learned that the horse was good enough
Ihey rushed in, took current odds, and Ikey Mo fattened
or a fortnight. The horse was out of sorts all the time,
and didn’t start.

Pickles will likely be the smallest of the Caul-
field Cup starters this j’ear. His owner fully believes the
little ’un is up to a fast mile and a half. As a rule, Caul-
field pickles are pretty hot, and the bottled up, well-pre-
served brand finds most favor.

OUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from w'hich I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medioine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expeotorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medioine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success.
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, arid wfe certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed
by Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong, and
59 other leading residents.

GENERAL DEBILITY
and Indigestion
Made Her Life Miserable, but She i 8
Cured by
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Read the testimony of Mrs. E. G.
Monro, Coburg, Victoria, whose por-
trait is also given:
“Some i.; v years ago I suffered
terribly with indigestion and gen-
eral debility. I could not sleep,
and my condition was such as to
make my life miserable. None of
the many remedies I tried did me
any good, and I despaired of ever
getting better. One of my friends
told me of the blood-purifying and
strength-giving properties of Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla, and I began taking it.
Before 1 had finished the first bottle
I felt better, and was thus encour-
aged to give the medicine a thorough
trial. In all I used four bottles,
and then was perfectly cured of the
grievous trouble which had afflicted
me, I now recommend, to anyone
suffering as I did.

Chief-Justice Madden told a Melb. jury,
the other day, that “ perjury of a superlatively
audacious character ” had been committed by one
side, or other, in a seduction-case. Superlatively
audacious nonsense. Mr. Madden has heard plenty
of such swearing and counter-swearing in divorce-

subject for perjury?

“In each of Mr. Wilde’s plays there has
been one really profound saying, which serves to
mark it in my memory. In ‘ Lady Windermere’s
Fan ’ it was : ‘ There are only two tragedies _ in
life: not getting what you want —and getting
it.’ In ‘A Woman of No Importance’ it was :
‘ Thought is in its essence destructive ; nothing
survives being thought of.’ In ‘ An Ideal Hus-
band ’ it was : ‘ Vulgarity is the behaviour of other
people.’ Simple as it seems, there is in this a
world of observation and instruction. Oscar
Wilde is a born playwright, who happens also to
be a man of letters, both born and bred.” Thus
William Archer.
Oongregationalist parson Ilayner, of
Glenelg (S.A.), “ can sing the National Anathema
with fervour,” but likes the second verse
omitted. S.A. ’Tiser, with a local glare at its
man, presumes that the parson can’t square his
peace-and-goodwill conscience with the blood-
thirsty request to the Almighty to “ scatter her
enemies and make them fall.” If that’s the hitch,
pastor Rayner should omit the first verse also,
since “ send her victorious” can only be an in-
direct hint to the Deity to wipe out somebody
else. The straw-splittings of the average Kerris-
tian conscience are as trivial as the average
lawyer's fiddle-faddle. Question: How much
would the “goodwill” of existing Kerristianity,
as “ a going concern,” fetch in the open market ?
Dear Bulletin, —A last word. The truth
of the snake-swallowing controversy is (vide my
writings on the subject S.M. Herald, March, ’88)
that the mother-snake calls her young in strange
hissing or clucking accents, opens her mouth
widely, and the young ophidians rush to her, as
chickens would to a hen, and glide down her
throat. I have known the Lace Lizard (Varanus
Variegata, Shaw), when its “ nest ” has been dis-
turbed, to scratch up its eggs, swallow and carry
them a distance of 15 chains, scratch out a fresh
“nest” or hole in the ground, disgorge the eggs
into it, and cover them up. Was this also canni-
balism?— H. J. M‘Cooey.

all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of
your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I pan with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, .
JOHN KEAY.

A Lady Cured, of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir, —I hereby beg to certify that having been
a sufferer from General Debility of the Nervous
System for over seven years, and having tried
without success several of the leading doctors
both in Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to
try your Alfaline Remedies. lam thankful I did
so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most
happy to recommend your remedies to anyone
suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which
you have treated me, allow me to say that you
can make what use you may think proper of this.
Wishing you every success, allow me to remain,
yours,

A woman walked unobserved into an open
cutting where blasting was going on in Omeo dis-
trict the other day. Only her hat was destroyed
in the concussion that followed. “The woman
devoutly thanked God for her deliverance,” says a
local paper. From which The Bulletin concludes
that the hat was pretty old.
King O’Malley, M.P. (S.A. )
It was because men drank champagne and gave up been
ate heavy dinners when they had been used to bug-back,
and because they became swills and puffed up, that God
raised up the Labor-party.
Bachelor O’Malley, by the way, created a sensa-
tion on a recent ministerial tour through his dis-
trict by nursing a lady elector’s baby on the
platform.
The Presbytery of Melbourne South lately
passed a solemn resolution to hold its meetings
always on the first Monday in each month, except
when Christmas Day (25th), Queen’s Birthday
(24th), or Prince of Wales’s Birthday (9th) falls
on such day. After awhile the collection of sour
saints became aware that the first Monday in each
month can’t happen later than the 7th, and the
resolution was amended. Then a saint wanted to
make special provision in case Good Friday fell on
the first Monday in the month.
Evangelist M‘Neill, holding forth at Balla-
rat to a Baptist congregation, pronounced the
doom of the Brassey family. The preacher was
remarking that Lord Brassey throws open the
Sunbeam to the public on Sundays. “Asa result
of this thoughtless action, watermen and others
were induced to work on the Sabbath in plying for
hire with their boats, and the Lord’s Day was,
therefore, desecrated. This work of Sabbath-
breaking, he predicted, would end disastrously,
and Providence would some day cause the Sun-
beam to strike on a rock and sink to the bottom of
the sea.”
There’s One above has got
His eye on Brassey’s yacht,
Which will surely give its “noble owner” one day
A sudden fatal shock
By colliding with a rock,
Since ’tis open to inspection on a Sunday.
Good shepherd J. M'Neill
Was commissioned to reveal
To the sheep whose simple souls he’s been awaking,
That the purpose of the Lord
Is to sink (with all aboard)
The Sunbeam, on a charge of Sabbath-breaking.
The well-upholstered boat,
Though at present quite afloat,
Will shortly disappear beneath the water,
Where the winkles, prawns, and sharks
Will play gastronomic larks
With Lord and Lady Brassey and the daughter ;
For Providence —so kind
To the piously-inclined
And sinners who are stricken with contrition—
Can he very hard, we know,
On a Sabbath-breaking show
If it snavels useful shillings for admission.
Yea, that’s where Brassey’s sin
Most undoubtedly comes in :
He doesn’t stick at charging for inspection,
And the blessed Cause he robs
Of some nimble little “ bobs”
Which might have fattened J. M'N.’s collection.

Dear Bulletin, —The paragraphs have ex-
tended over three months : “ David Syme, true
to his democratic instincts, prefers breathing,
bread-eating comps, to the linotypes.” “David
Syme will not introduce linotypes at the Age
office.” “David Syme is said to have an idea
of importing half a dozen linotype machines.”
“Linotypes are to supplant the comps, at the Age
office.” This is how truth prevails now-a-days.—S.

America leads again. Chicago city council
fives medical men, for the consideration of a two-
shilling piece (50 cents), a little badge with a red
cross on it, which gives the wearer “right of way”
for himself and his vehicle in Chicago streets as
against all processions, persons, vehicles or animals.
A full-length portrait in oils of F. C.
Mason, M.L. A., hangs around the ground floor of
the Vic. Artists’ Gallery, facing the refreshment
bar. Gordon Coutts, who painted it to somebody’s
order, has caught the true sentiment of this painful
subject. There stands the wooden-looking Mason
in a new frock coat with velvet collar, new
trousers fresh from the tailor’s press, newly-oiled
hair, and new boots pointing left and right. The
velvet collar is characteristic of the man, and the
portrait, as a whole, harmonises with the collar.
Indeed, the work is good of its class, which class
is good enough for Mason, M.L. A. The
glorified chairman of Committees will, in due
course, be formally presented with this mark of
esteem.

Wot Made in Heaven .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He had a bad lower lip, a sloping occiput and
dyed hair and moustache. She used to have to
brush the dye on for him. I thought that a ver?
hard clause of the matrimonial contract. She
thought so, too. She was 22. He was 48 She
was extremely and delicately pretty. Reminded
me of eggshell china. He was tall, swarthy and
stout, and until you got to hate him, which you
did in 20 minutes, you would consider him hand-
some.
Mour wife does not appear to be very strori"' ”
We were standing on the verandah with our
after-dinner pipes when I made the remark. He
sent a sullen glance through the open window to
W fra^le creature was nursing her baby
bhe is not strong,” he grunted. “I’ve been
married five years, and in .that time I’ve not had
her one day sound.”
He was a lawyer, and had been struck off the
rolls in another province. In this one he
had managed to secure a clerkship at A 4 a week.
His name was Grantby, and with his wife and
delicate, ill-tempered baby he was staying at the
same second-rate East Melbourne boarding-house
as myself. Mrs. Grantby was known amongst the
other boarders as “A Study in Shudders,” a
compliment to the effect which her hus-
band’s basilisk glances produced on her
The landlady told me that Mr. Grantby
loved Mrs. Grantby “something frightful, and
could not bear her to speak to any other gent. ”
Also, she mentioned that if Mrs. Grantby left
her room in the morning before her master, or did
not return to it at the same moment as he did, he
would pinch the sleeping infant, set it screaming,
and so fetch the mother at the double. If a ques-
tion or remark were addressed her in Grantby’s
presence, she always glanced at him before answer-
ing, as if to get his permission to speak, or to read
in his bad face what her answer ought to be. At
meals she never took a second helping or cup of
tea unless he told her to pass up her plate or cup.
If he was off his feed, she ate nothing. When he
laughed, she smiled. When he was ill-tempered,
she wept—he gave her good cause. She was as
slavish and terrorised as any aboriginal woman.
“ Get your wife a couple of dozen of stout,” said
I to Beauty’s Beast one day. She was recovering
from the birth of a dead infant. He was recover-
ing from a drunken spree. I was a medical
student and had learned something that made me
want to murder him. He got the stout, and with
the exception of two bottles, drank the whole of
it himself. The eggshell-china wife resumed con-
sumption of the boarding-house boiled tea.
“Get some more stout,” said I, “and leave it
for her.”
“ No,” he answered ; “ it’s too much temptation
for me to have in the house. I daresay she wants
it, but a woman ought to make some sacrifice for
her husband.”
As for the woman, all her faculties were con-
centrated in love for her child, whilst her
nervous system had turned fluid under her
husband’s quiet brutality. Out of my modest
medical knowledge I gave her a year to live.
Three years had sped before I met the Grantbys
again. I was practising in Sydney and happened
to drop into a seat beside them in the Lyceum
dress-circle. I was surprised to see the little
woman alive, let alone so altered for the better.
She had gained at least 2st. in weight. There was
color m her cheeks, light in her eyes, ease in her
manner. Presently I doubted if the change was
tor the better. Her face and voice were hard and,
in a sense, unpleasant.
We chatted for a while. When the curtain fell
on the end of the second act Grantby scowled and
averred that “ the play was rot.”
Ah ! ” yawned his wife, “ I’ve no doubt those
pork-producing animals of which Chicago is so
fond would grunt out the same idea if someone
threw pearls into' their trough. ”
Grantby must have heard the gasp I emitted.
1 put on my glasses and had a good look at the
eggshell-china woman who used to be afraid to
take a second cup of tea unless her husband bade
her do so.
“ Well,’’answered Grantby, quietly savage, “I’m
going home. Come on.”
She looked up at him and laughed derisively.
‘ Certainly not. I’ll stay till the gas is being
put out. But don’t you wait. My old friend the
young doctor will see me home— sweet home.”
cn so ' le hved in a cottage at the North
Shore. On the way I got her to talk, and so
learned the reason of the change in her. The ill-
tempered baby was dead a year before. And
with it had died the mother’s ability to
feel, had died also love of life, hope, and
the remnant of the affection she once bore
her husband. A curious physical and psycho-
logical change followed. Freed from moral
and personal fear, her health grew better. The
emotional side of her nature shrivelled, whilst the
intellectual aspect brightened and hardened.
Where she had been nervous she was now defiant.
Grantby’s key to the nature of the wife of last
vear was useless for the woman who had taken
her place.
“ I hold him of such little account,” said she, as
we stepped on to the wharf, “that I don’t take
the trouble to leave him. His great joy in life
was to see me in a state of abject fear and fawning.
Now he is miserable because lam not. It was his
fault that my child was so frail, so I look upon
him as the cause of her death. But it lessened
my grief a little to see that his was great, for he
certainly loved her too. This is our place,”
The cottage before which we stopped Was in
utter darkness. No answer was returned to my
repeated ringing and knocking.
“He has locked up the house,” remarked Mrs.
Grantby, “ and forbidden the servant to answer.
I must see that this doesn’t occur again. Go on
to the road, doctor, and get me a nice handy piece
of road-metal. ” I obeyed, then followed her to
the side of the house.
“This is my husband’s room.” She indicated
it by hurling two pounds of blue-metal through
the window. An angry shout came from within
the darkened room, the hall door was flung open,
and Grantby, muttering threats and imprecations,
pulled his wife inside and banged the door. I felt
very unmanly as I sneaked off hurriedly. The
brute would certainly beat her. If she taunted him
he might kill her. His horrible threats seemed
to echo in my ears as I walked back to the ferry.
Suddenly I turned and fairly raced over the
ground I had just covered. He must be beating
her. I panted up to the cottage. A room in front
was lighted with two flaring gas-jets without
globes. The blinds were not lowered. Mrs.
Grantby sat at a little cottage piano strumming a
noisy music-hall air. I slipped along to where I
could view the man’s room. Grantby was in his
pyjamas and the light in his rear showed that he
was stuffing papers and clothes into the gash in
his window.

Some Mummeries.
Mr. F. J. Hallewell, the father of singing in Sydney, has
sedulously cultivated the art. He is a gentleman who
can cry to order—an artist—and is extremely partial to
old English glees. His pupils reverence his artistic in-
stincts, and bend the knee to his interpretation of ora-
torio. For a famous singer, he is very unassuming, and
has informed his friends that he is only now learning how
to sing. “ Old Dad,” as he is familiarly termed, admires
ungrudgingly the great Gounod, and echoes the senti-
ments conveyed in that musician’s confession regarding
Mozart. Said the composer : “At2l it was I. At a later
stage of existence, I and Mozart. As years rolled by,
Mozart and I. In the evening of life, Mozart.” Mr.
Hallewell was, once upon a time, choirmaster at St.
Mary’s Cathedral. He is always willing to lend a helping
hand to youthful singers, whom he advises to “Try not
to try ” when singing.
There is one character in which Bellew doesn’t hesitate
to cover up his classic beauty. That is “ Charlotte Cor-
day,” the eponymous heroine of which stabs him while he
is taking a medicated bath. Bellew makes himself as
hideous as possible : dirty, physically feeble, and catarrhal.
By the way, on the first night of this tragedy-in-a-bath-
tub the barrel in which Bellew was taking his last wash
toppled over : it was perfectly empty, and the curly one
was seated in it, comfortably clothed from head to foot.
Pro. : This story is true, of a well-known Sydney
singer, Signora . She was at the head of a small
opera-co. in the country, playing a couple of “ show-
dates.” “ 111 Trovatore ” was the opera. Signora——,
as Leonora, sang in Italian, and a portion of the audience,
stupid with vine (or gum) leaves in its uncombed hair,
was noisy and hisssed. Signora submitted for a time, but
in Leonora’s dying-scene lost her temper, and instead of
the operatic words sang out “Ignoramuses! Ignor-
amuses ! ! Ignoramuses 1!! ” The audience accepted the
fiery censure as part of the role, but the rest of the per-
formers standing at the wing nearly died laughing.
We have just seen departing from our shores Miss
Colborne-Baber. This lady was wont to be asked by
youthful aspirants for musical honors what throat process
was necessary to be “in form.” She used to tender
advice as follows ; “ Eat a hearty meal at, say, 4.30 p.m.,
wash it down decently, and read a pleasure-giving novel
until the time approaches to sing. Take nothing in the
meantime, but if absolutely needed, a medium cup of tea
would not be quite amiss.” To Miss Baber’s intimate
friends, it is known that she has been spurred on to
greater ambition by the unequivocal successes of her
once friendly rival, Miss Frances Saville. When the
latter was here, there Was certainly some division of
engagements between the two cantatrices. Ultimately,
when Miss Saville courted leisure moments in preference
to the continuous plaudits of the populace, as became her
independent circumstances, Miss Baber had the field all
to herself.
“The Silver King,” least melodramatic and best of
nielodramas, has one incident which shows how impossible
it is for the melo-dramatist to refrain entirely from melo-
draming. In the scene in the den by the river, Denver,
disguised as an idiot, having heard The Spider accused of
the murder of which he believes himself guilty, gives
himself away purely for the sake of a tableau. “Itis I,
Wilfred Denver ! ” he shrieks, tearing open his shirt and
jumping into the limelight. The Spider (who shot Ware)
lets his man skip without drawing on him. The audience
likes the scene, but it is bald, inartistic dazzle, and a blot
on a great play.
Williamson only gets ,£6O a week outof the Melb. “ Silver
King,” and wonders why he did not produce it himself,
and collar the swag.
Somebody sends along a playbill of a recent performance
of “ Silver King” by a scratch co. Out Back. The leading
mummers announce that they played their parts for 1200
nights in Melbourne and Sydney, and, as no one is re-
ported to have expressed dissent with an egg, the audience
probably believed it. Wilfred Denver and Jaikes were
played by the same man, therefore the impossible old
servitor didn’t meet Denver and give him his life’s sav-
ings ; he simply soliloquised to the effect that he would
offer Wilfred the money when he came in ; and then Wil-
fred arrived and monologued to the effect that he would
take the coin if Jaikes pressed it on him. Truly it is a
hard life to be a cheap mummer in the bush. The chief
points about it are the periodical breakdowns of the ghost,
the seizure of the props, for the unpaid board-bill, the
ejectment of the co. into the street by the infuriated pub.-
keeper, and then the long row of homeless tragedians in
broken boots pondering on the pavement, and wailing at
intervals to the unsympathetio groggist : “ Gimme back
me clothes.”
Pro. : ’Twas the first night of a new piece, and we were
all a bit nervous. In one scene I had to read a long letter,
and, knowing I would have the paper in my hand, had
omitted to learn the text. On this epistle the plot turned.
Just before the cue came for me to read, I discovered I
had forgotten the precious writing. I had the stage to
myself, so could not get it brought on. I whispered to
the prompter, “Have forgotten letter.” As the time came
nearer I was in an awful funk, but at the critical moment
the author, who was at the wings, came on, and held out
the important paper. He grasped my hand and exclaimed,
“My dear fellow, forgive the liberty of an old friend.
You dropped this out of your pocket. And now, pardon
my departure—my bride awaits me 1 ” Who the author
was, and what his bride had to do with the play, was
never explained to the audience.
Critic Bernard Shaw on Geraldine Oliffe, in Jones’s new
play : “Miss Oliffe, who played Mrs. Prothero, was new
to the London critics, though I had had the luck to dis-
cover her at the Avenue during the illness of Mrs. Alma
Stanley some time ago. She deepened the favorable im-
pression I received on that occasion, and will, I have no
doubt, soon be a familiar and indispensable figure in our
London drawing castes. The end of that will be, I sup-
pose, that she will give up acting and have all her parts
written expressly for her.” When a London critic happens
to be the first to praise an actress or an author, he maims
to have been a discoverer. It is Cockney cheek.
A Frenchman gives the latest explanation of the
Indian juggler’s “mango trick.” In this famous con-
jurors’ puzzle the operator plants a mango-seed in some
earth he brings with him, covers it with a cloth, and in a
few minutes the cloth begins to be pushed up by a grow-
ing plant to the height of even a yard. “M. Ragonneau
noticed that the jugglers invariably brought their own
earth, and at last found that it was always taken from
ant-hills. Analysis of such earth showed it to be strongly
impregnated with ‘formic acid,’a substance which causes
the bad smell of ants or bugs, and which chemists obtain
by boiling down red ants. The Frenchman tried common
earth impregnated with dilute formic acid (1 in 5000), and
promptly duplicated the performance. The growth is a
natural process due to the acid most rapidly consuming
the hard outer skin of the seed, and strongly stimulating
the growth of the germ within.” All a fake. The best
accounts of the “mango trick” include the growth of
flowers and fruit; and you can’t get a tree a yatd high,
with flowers and fruit, out of a seed in a few minutes
with the assistance of any amount of “ formic earth ” or
“ formic acid,” any more than you can get a full-
grown rooster out of a new-laid egg. The “mango
trick ” isn’t an actuality : it’s an illusion; and the
only feasible explanation of it is that all the specta-
tors are hypnotised by the performer. The writer
once saw a certain amount of “mango trick” dur-
ing a steamer stoppage at Colombo. The performer
admitted that he was only a tyro ; he had to make three
attempts before he got a tree ; and the spectators were
kept about 20 yards off. But he had no earth and no
cloth ; only a little wicker basket; and his basket, him-
self, his loin-rag, and his stage were well scrutinised
before and after the performance. Nevertheless, he laid
the basket mouth downwards on the stones of a court-
yard, incanted and pattered a bit, lifted the basket and
showed a miniature tree about four inches high. On
went the basket again ; more incantation ; basket off ;
tree about a foot high, seemingly growing quite naturally
between two stones. Performance repeated, and the tree
grew another six inches; basket put on and taken off
again—tree gone altogether ! That man couldn’t make
flowers or fruit; said he didn’t know enough. But,
barring hypnotism, a dozen pair of sharp eyes could find
no clue to the mechanism of his phenomena.
Joe Jefferson claims to be the original infant in the
well-worn property yarn of “ The Scalping of Rolla.” He
says he was a startled child in a white tunic, beautifully
striped with gold bands, and in the grasp of an infuriated
tragedian crossing a shaky bridge In a blaze of fire and
smoke. To little Joe the position was perilous, and he
seized Rolla by the hair of his head. The noble Peruvian
cried, “ Let go ! ” but as “ Joe ” was obeying the first law
of nature and not “ Rolla,” he gripped the top-knot
tighter, and the next instant the chieftain, bereft of his
feather-duster head-dress and wig, was publicly scalped.

than, the condemnatory opinion the late Gov.

Cheerful item from Sydney Bankruptcy
Court :
Insolvent said he was formerly an undertaker, now an
acrobat. Insolvency due to depression of trade. Assets
included a hearse worth £l5, and two horses, one valued
at £l3 2s. 6d. and the other at £4. During the recent hot
weather he engaged a carpenter to make coffins, as he had
a rush of work for the Asylum. His wife hoped to do a
brisk business in Liverpool in winter, as there were
generally a good many deaths at that time.
An English sassiety paper reports : ‘ ‘ One
of the latest whispers from the upper circles is
that boiled beans and bacon have been served
lately at some very smart dinners in the best
houses. ” A democratic cynic says of this startling
circumstance : You may not see why the upper
circles should eat beans and bacon in fear and
trembling, and whisper the fact with awe ; but,
then, there is a reason.” A strange mystery
attaches to certain dishes. The writer remembers
an instance of one fat feeder breathing solemnly
in the ear of another fat feeder, “ The finest meal
to be obtained in the city of London at the present
moment is— ham and peas. ” He spake the words
“ ham and peas” so softly and slowly that one
could have heard a pin drop between them. After
which, he recoiled a few paces and waited for his
agitated friend to recover from the shock of the
announcement. Then they sighed in unison and
went away to obtain ham and peas at a restaurant.

The Shooting of Saysoon.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He had had so many masters that no one knew
who had christened him, but his name was bay-
soon when he followed the butcher to the door of
a new customer, and promptly chewed a cat which
attempted to pass him at the gate, then he
sneaked his head in under his master s arm and
grabbed two pounds of rump steak, which went
down with a gobble. . ,
The missus happened to be passing the door.
‘ ‘ You old wretch ! ” she cried. .
Saysoon licked his lips and waved his great
dirty-white tail; then, with a grin which bared
his well-worn fangs, he flopped down at her feet
and laid his huge, square jowl upon his crooked
forepaws. , , . , ~.
“ Why don’t you teach him manners—letting
him steal like that ? ’ the missus asked.
“ That’s more than anyone has ever been able
to do. If a ladylike yurself ’ud had ’m from a
p U p I—but he’s too old now ; he’s the wickedest old
devil in the town.”
“He doesn’t look it—such lovely, mild brown
eyes.” , , ,
” “ Just you ’it ’im a clip on the ear and see em
redden.” ' . _ , ,
The missus concluded not to try the effect ot a
“ Is he a Newfoundland ? ” she asked.
“ Yes—pure bred ; stole in the beginning, they
sa y —he’s somewhere about eleven; I ve ad im
myself for four year.”
The butcher turned to go, and Saysoon rose with
difficulty and staggered as he regained his feet.
He was but a bag of bones, with patches of
mange showing pink at every joint, his black and
white coat matted, harsh and unhealthy. ,
“ Mangy from raw meat,” the man explained ;
“ if you don’t give it ’im he’ll kill it for ’imself—
and ’is loins is gone from the boys riding im in
the streets—he’s rare good to the pups an the
kiddies.” „
“ I suppose you wouldn t sell him . , „
“ Times are that bad, I would for five shillin s.
“Then bring him round to-morrow with his
collar and chain. ”
The man chuckled.
“ He’s never ’ad a collar, being known ter the
perlice;’ and he’d slip his ’ead through any leather
tanned.” ...
The missus smiled. She was a clever contriver,
and there was a snug loosebox to the stable.
Saysoon arrived next day. He howled a bit
when the butcher drove away and left him in the
loosebox, then stood at the barred-door looking
piteously at the missus when she came near.
He took very kindly to her caresses and the
warm boiled food she gave him, and the family
congratulated her upon her purchase as the even-
ing passed without sound from the captive.
In the morning one of the bars of the loosebox-
door lay in fragments on the ground, and Saysoon
had taken his aching teeth home to the shop.
They lined the door with stout wire-netting, but
he grubbed a hole in the clay floor under the wall
and went home again.
They tied him so tightly with a collar that he
appeared choking, but he slipped that with ease ;
and then they devised a girth with a strap from it
to the collar, but he wriggled round and chewed
the connecting leather, slipped the collar again,
and went home with the girth on him. I hat ex-
periment cost them ten shillings. _
A.t last they euchred him with a similar fixture
made from dog-chains, upon which he only once
tried his teeth, then resigned himself to his fate.
He sustained his reputation in the district,
worried cats, fought dogs at every chance, brought
threats of sudden death upon himself from travel-
ling shepherds whose mobs he loved to scatter.
It was no use calling him, he would go on, and,
after the mischief was done, would come back
waving his tail and grinning with delight.
At first they tried to beat him, but he convinced
them that it would be “ a bite for a blow.”
The missus could always manage him, when she
was by. A tweak of his ear was enough—her he
never rebelled against—but he knew how to get
what he wanted from her.
When he came she had said, “ He shall have a
good time for a year, then we’ll shoot him ; I can’t
think how anyone can be cruel enough to let an
animal die of old age.”
“ Wants shooting himself if he does,” the
master agreed.
The year passed—then two ; Saysoon’s looks
testified to the good times, but there was still no
word of the shooting.
January came, with Christmas bills unpaid and
pinching poverty.
“ Shall we register him for just one more year ? ”
the missus asked.
The master looked at her wistful face. “It
won’t break us, I expect,” he said.
“ Nonsense, pater,” the eldest daughter put in ;
“ he’s cost us a mint of money already, what with
his food and his freaks. He’ll be certain not to
live through the winter.”
The family was breakfasting ; there came a
knock at the door ; a small boy handed a note to
the eldest daughter, who took it to her father.,
“Something more about Saysoon, I bet,” she
grumbled.
It was ; a polite request that Saysoon might be
kept to his owner’s bounds, and an intimation that
if he did any more pounds’ worth of damage the
writer would act as executioner.
“ I wish he would make away with the old brute
for us,” the master sighed.
“ I never saw such a fuss—shooting a dog ;
why, I’ll shoot him if you show me how,” the
eldest daughter snapped.
“There, there, that’s enough ; we’ll agree to
pop him off on the thirty-first —that’s the regis-
tration limit,” said the missus, with misty eyes.
A little lad slipped from his chair and went out.
He cast himself full-length beside Saysoon, who
sprawled all over him.
“ He was a busy dog, and then they scold him—
poor old dearest.” _ _ _ _
Saysoon rubbed his nose with one paw and smiled
as usual. .
That evening they noticed that his hind-legs
were shaky, and two days later he could only drag
them feebly in a clumsy crawl.
When the small children were in bed the missus
said :
“ What about Saysoon ? ’
“I suppose he’ll have to go now,” the master
groaned.
He fetched his gun and went to where the dog
was lying in the new-cut hay.
Saysoon had been a good retriever, and usually
bounded at sight of a gun. Now he looked up
quickly, sniffed, and flattened his brows.
He refused to rise, no coaxing would move him ;
and then when the master gave it up and turned
his back Saysoon crawled into the kitchen and
pressed close to the missus’s skirt.
She looked down ; there was water in her eyes.
She took the great head in her hands, put her
brow to the thick frontal and whispered,
“ They shan’t shoot you, Say., they shan t.
He raised himself on his crippled quarters,
pawed her lap till she shook hands, then rolled
over and licked her shoe.
The master appeared in the doorway.
“ The old dog wouldn’t !! ”
The missus pushed him out into the passage and
shut the door behind her. .
“ Sh-h-h ! Never mind to-night; hes in no
pain.” -
When she went back to the kitchen Saysoon was
not there.
In the morning the missus stood at the break-
fast-table as the family seated itself ; the little lad
came in.
“ Oh mother ! I can’t find Saysoon anywhere ;
there are marks all along the road where he’s been
dragging along.”
The eldest sister s eyes grew dim, then liquid-
bright as she glared defiantly round the table,
daring notice ; the missus shaved ham with mar-
vellous dexterity, and dealt the plates round like
playing-cards.
As the master came in she said :
“ I might have known it —he’s crept away to die
alone.”
The master pushed away his porridge and blew
his nose ; the little lad sniffed and went out. _
After a few minutes he came back in eager joy.
“ I’ve found him ! He’s in the trees down the
paddock, but he can’t get up ! ”
In revulsion, the missus’s grief turned to anger.
“Walter !” she said severely to her biggest son,
“ go to town at once and bring me the proper dose
of prussic acid for a large dog ! ” _
“Nonsense!” the master cried, “you’ll be
poisoning yourself. I’d look well at the inquest —
d the dog ! Fetch me the gun, Walter ! ”
As he passed the missus she grabbed his sleeve :
“You can’t now, with everyone about. I’ll pay
someone to do it.”
“Yes, and have him half-killed —besides, I’ve
not a cent available until next Monday.”
All day long Saysoon lay in the shade with one
and another watching him. Walter scoured the
district, but no one could or would come over, and
the master returned at six o’clock sick at heart
and trying to hope it was done.
Dusk fell, the children were in bed ; the master
took the gun and walked firmly to the paddock
fence; he called the missus from among the trees.
When she came close he saw her anguished face.
“I feel a vile traitor,” she moaned. “I pro-
mised him you shouldn’t.”
He dropped the gun to his side.
“ And lam a beastly coward. I’ll make a mull
of it—it’s like a blooming murder—l can’t! Don’t
be ashamed of me ! ”
“I love you for it,” she whispered. “You go
inside; I’ll see to it.”
His face paled.
“ You’re never going to attempt it yourself ? ”
“No, no. See those men coming down the
road? They’ll do it; and we’ll never see them
again, thank goodness ! ”
“ But I’ve not a penny to give them ! ”
“ I have, my lucky half-crowns.”
The strangers were lads with kindly faces ; they
had no objection to shooting a strange dog. The
missus gave them a hunk of meat, which one was
to offer from the front while the other sneaked in
behind ; he would never know.
“Mind!” she said; “two half-crowns each if
there is only one shot —and —no other sound ! ”
Then they fled indoors.
The eldest daughter sat at the piano. Her
father shouted, “ Play ! play ! as loud as ever you
can! ”
She straightened up, struck a feeble chord ; then
her hands fell limply to her lap, and great drops
splashed down upon the keys.
In the corner the missus was hunting the half-
crowns among the rustling papers of a drawer,
where she well knew they were not.
There came the dull “ plop ” of a charge fired
into the earth —and no other sound.
The master helped himself to a big nip of
whisky.

Tb« NEW “LIP-FLANGE” FRUE VANNER BELT.
“ Will Otitlast Two of tlje Ordioary.”
Genuine “ Frue ” Belts (obtainable only from
the patentees or their authorised agents) have, owing
to the great care and attention paid to their manu-
facture, invariably given good satisfaction, but, after
being in use a long time, the old flange had a ten-
dency to become weak and lose its vertical position.
This prevented the machine carrying the proper depth
of load, and allowed the sand to slop over and get
into the bearings. The new “ Lip-Flange,” which
SECTIONAL VIEW OF FLANGE.
has just been patented throughout the colonies, does
away with this difficulty almost entirely. It is
made of a very superior and elastic rubber prepared
in a special manner, and its peculiar shape prevents
it cracking in going over the rollers, or losing its
vertical position. All “ Frue Yanners ” sold in the
future will be fitted with this new “Lip-Flange”
Belt without additional charge, and the belts them-
selves may be procured from the patentees at a very
slight advance on the old price.
