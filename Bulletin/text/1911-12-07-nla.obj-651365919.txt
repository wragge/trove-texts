SAME AS YOU.
If your luck is out with women; if you’ve
looked too long on wine,
Do not sit and nurse the anger of your
anguish, brother mine,
For the sun will rise to-morrow, and the
skies be just as blue,
And you’ll find that otner fellows have their
troubles—same as you.
There’s a gun for you to carry; there’s an
oar for you to mill;
There’s a saddle and a stockwhip, and the
earth is bountiful;
There’s a corner for you somewhere; there’s
another girl to woo;
And you’ll meet a mate out yonder, who lias
suffered, same. as you.
Though your aching heart be empty, and
your pockets much the same,
Though the dice of Fate are loaded, be • a
man, and play the game!
There is something left to live for —to your
own strong soul.be true.
And we’ll take your hand and grip it, who
have battled, same as you.
You may never back the winner, you may
never win the maid;
You may never find a nugget, make a fortune
out of trade;
But you’ll always find your manhood, if you
keep the fact in view,
That some other chaps are trying to be
honest- —same as you.
When they come to add up figures, and to
total you and me,
W hen the Game of Life is over, and all
things as nothing be,
It may chance —who knoweth, brothei ——that
the old beliefs were true?'
And His voice across the Shadow shall re-
echo through and through—
“ Peace be with ye, Sons of Sorrow! I have
suffered —same as you!”
E. J. Brady, in “Bells and Hobbles.”
Edwin dames Brady
Brady belongs to the bush-yearning school
of Australian poets. Of course, most of
this school live in town, because you can’t
yearn for the bush when you’re in the bush.
But, by making an occasional short excur-
sion to the not-so-far-backblocks, and return-
ing by Saturday morning to the yicinjty of
George-street, you can supply a good length
of bush-yearn and be paid for it on the spot-.
But Brady actually does spend most of his
time more or less in the bush. He went
river roving in a Lone Hand motor-boat
down the Murray, and caravaning from
Sydney to Townsville. The King’s Cara-
van (Arnold, 12s. 6d.) makes a splendidly
illustrated book of an interesting trip. Brady
has a picturesque style, a seeing eye, and a
fund of casual Australian humor. For
English readers this volume will be a valu-
able impression of intimate Australia, while
Australians might dip into it with profit
and entertainment. He confesses that he
left Parramatta with his waggon and equip-
ment and 30s. in hand, and returned to Syd-
ney by steamer from Townsville; 12 months
later, with ss. But he earned £3OO en
route, financing the trip by “pumping out”
literary and journalistic work. The King’s
Caravan is not pumped out: it is an artesian
bore of digressive, cheerful, picturesque good-
Australianism.
By such a book Brady offers a valid ex-
cuse for belonging to the bush-yearning
school of poets. His Bells and Hobbles
(Robertson, Melb.), is his third book of
verse. It is neither better nor worse than
The Ways of Many Waters' and Bushland
Ballads— which is rather in the way of
praise than blue-metal. Brady writes, of
his school, good Australian verse —the
trouble is that he writes so much. His
Pegasus would be a finer moke if it were
hobbled. Most of these verses have appeared
in The Bulletin, and the diffuseness pardon-
able in occasional verses, when these are col-
lected under one cover, becomes as noticeable
as a Wowser on Manly beach. But a book
that begins so breezily thus':—
When our feet are in tltc stirrups,
And our hands are to the reins,
When the cities lie behind us
And before us spread the plains,
There’s a song of night and morning
That in minor music swells,
’Tis the jangle of the hobbles
And the jingle of the bells —
Bells and hobbles,
Hobbles and bells.
will always find a public in this Common-
wealth.
Brady’s chief fault is sloppiness. In de-
scribing the people of the “Outposts,”. for
instance, he can pen a false line like this: —
They walk in homely raiment; coarse fare
the cupboard fills,
which is stilted and absurd ; and yet, in the
same poem, he escapes from the taint of the
literary epithet with —
Lank heroes clothed in moleskin, brown
heroines in print.
Which calls ul> the striking image, the slop-
piness of ihe former line, the sharpness of
the latter?
His humor is the obvious, easy-going hu-
mor of the Australian, with no malice in it.
Here is his neat description of the combat-
ants who fought to decide whether it was
“bullicks” or “ ’orse” that made the coun-
try:—
The man from Rocky River,
.1 Burns in sooth was he
In all but skill and training
And build and hittery.
A Johnson—lacking color,
Strength, stamina and brain,
And scientific teaching —
The man from Jindabayne.
The fight was a draw.
There is poetry in the book. Brady has
the knack of the picturesque phrase, with a
fancy gilding it.
High Northern suns their brazen shields,
Like warriors, hang above the fields
Where Sultan Summer frankly yields
His plenteous boon;
Like nautcli girls dance the naked days
Down .avenues of cane and maize.
While on his pipes the North-wind plays
A careless tune.
But, at the same time, he can descend to the
gutter of the guide-book.
I am back in sunny Queensland,
Where the custard apples fruit;
I am driving down the Logan,
Where they grow the arrowroot.
And he will rime “dawn” with “morn.” and
more than once we meet that hallowed Aus-
tralian rime of “stars” with “bars” (not
public, but river or tidal). Granted that,
by some criminal oversight of the bloke who
manufactured our language, there are not
enough useful rimes for stars, it is up to
our poets to give the constellations or flie
pubs a rest.
Brady is seen at his best in the vigorous
metre of “The Doers,” which thus begins:—
They <• othered on the strand, with d hatchet
in the hand —
And the same was made of stone—
They pointed mammoth spears at the Puzzle
of the Nears
In the, primal dusk alone.
They took the hollowed bole and they nosed it
to the roll
In a neolithic dawn;'
And they sang a cave-man's song as they
crept the shores along - —•
Going westward with the morn.
Each new-found land they trod did they dedi-
cate to god
Who was fash toyed out of wood;
They looted and they lied, and they devilled
and they died ,
And the whole result was good:
For the traders of the clan followed closely
on the van
Of the Doers who had done;
Till the merchant service grew from a single
bark canoe •
To a fleet of forty-one!
They bartered bone and hide for the gods
of f other-side.
And they,cheated in the trade.
That the daughter of a thief might be wedded
to a chief—
So the hairy gossips said.
Australian Winifred Janies is on the
road to popularity. Announced that she is
the author of Letters to My Son, published
anonymously, and now in its thirteenth
edition. Consequently, her Letters of a
Spinster are forthcoming.
J. D. Ilenry, who styles himself “Colonial
Oil Authority,” and also “a petroleum pub-
licist,” is the author of a huge and enthus-
iastic book on the Oil Fields of New Zea-
land. New Plymouth, he states, after being
an insignificant oip town for 50 years, is
designed to become a place of vast import-
ance. The Maoriland oil business is pro-
tected against foreign competition by its
geographical position and the equally effect-
ive instrument of a high anti-foreign tariff.
Also, it is right away on the extreme edge
of the war zone of the oil syndicates, and it
has a big future market in liquid fuel for
the Australasian navies. Incidentally, he
remarks that “every obsolete battleship
which is sold to the shipbreaker, means the
loss of a protected floating oil tank.” The
author covers the history and prospects of
the various oil propositions in Maoriland •
and for petroleum publicists this book should
be valuable, while to the general reader it
indicates Maoriland’s ability to supply the
nasty-smelling stuff that will be the life-
blood of this century.
Pleasant, facile verse, no more, is Ella
McFadyen’s Outland Horn, and other Verses*
(A ust. Authors’ Agency. Melb.). She
writes nice little things about “Pickers” and
“Brisbane Water” and “Seagulls”, and
“Wentworth House” and “Autumn” and
“The Old Sledge Road”—the local or- the
conventional subject, touched here and there
.with faint fancy, and not over-ad irned with
fine phrases. Negligible as: poetry, readable
as verse, interesting as the first essay of an
Australian versifier. Here is a sample ex-
cerpt. rather above her average quality,
from “The Road to Penang” :—
That day the sea had wed the land,
Beneath a veil of pearls,
And following on her footsteps came
Her train of mist wreath girls.
*
And where the road climbed ever up,
Against the mountain side,
The southwind. met us, charged with rain —
The diamonds for the bride.
Paris
J.UUCU romantic rubbish has been written
about Paris. Living on our memories, we
conceive Paris as a place of gaiety, glitter
and Bohemianism, where every woman is
facile and every wife unfaithful. But that
is the Paris of literature and the drama:
modern Paris is a city where, as in all other
cities, women work, families live lives of
dull respectability, and the Wowser is abroad
in the laud. The representative dramatist,
Brieux, devoted one recent play almost en-
tirely to the Wowser. Modern Paris has
grown up. It has lost its individuality and
become cosmopolitan. Its soul is slowly
merging into the over-soul of Europe. So
Charles Dawbarn’s France and the French
(Methuen, 10s. 6d.) is worth reading for
a sane appreciation of the modern French
soul. In pedestrian prose Dawbarn stresses
tlm underlying points of likeness, though
in his historical data he is not infallible.
The first thing to be noted is that Bohem-
ianism is dead. “How can you be Bohemian
in a brand-new house, with gas and water
on every floor? To-day the student is a
serious soul. He takes the tramcar to his
home of an evening, and actually wears
evening dress -on ceremonious occasions!”
And France has settled most of her big
questions. There is no House of Lords to
throw down ; the aristocracy' was abolished
a hundred years ago; in the same way, the
land question was solved for all time, solved
by a seizure of the property of the nobles
and by a minute subdivision of all estates
amongst the pegsanft-y.
Quite recently, the French have adopted
the two years’ military service system. They
resolved, in order to compensate for the loss
that such an innovation entailed in the effec-
tives of the army, to suppress all exemptions.
. ... Every young man. even . the senator's
son, must complete his full term in a regi-
ment, and, moreover, authority is less indul-
gent towards any absence from drill. These
hardship's, if they are hardships in the real
sense, have wrought an infinite physical good
to the nation.
But the military ardor of the French has
been swamped by their recent recognition of
the value of spot cash. France is the
richest country in Europe.
Solid prosperity has made Jacques Bon-
homme a pacific person ; his victories to-day
are won upon the European money-markets,
whereas formerly they were gained upon the
field of carnage. He lends money to all the
world and receives good and safe interest for
it.... France is the consummate shopkeeper.
....During the last few years France has
come to play the-part of peacemaker in
Europe, because of her vast and superabun-
dant wealth.... Nations can hardly Wage
war without the consent of wealthy Mari-
anne.
The morality of the French is a subject
on which Dawbarn speaks with frankness.
The author merely points out that French
morality is different to, not better nor worse,
than English. A Fx - enchman, for instance, has
been heard to object to “The Geisha” as an
immoral play. And the Frenchman, with
the cold, mental lucidity that is his charac-
teristic, considers it immoral to flirt. Worse,
he thinks it foolish. And as to the lure that
Paris possesses as a city of attractive im-
morality :
The chief upholder of the objectionable
spectacle of the gay restaurant is the visitor
and not the Parisian. When thb Boer war
was in progress, and English people ab-
stained from Paris by reason of the Anglo-
phobia of the press, and from a reluctance
to adopt the festive air whilst the country
was passing through a crisis, the Moulin
Bouge—historic home of the can-can—closed
its doors. It could- not live without the Eng-
lish. The Parisian who visits such spectacles
is a rara ams.
■ Of course a Frenchman has a different con-
ception of a woman, probably because the
Frenchwoman is different from other wdmen.
She insists on remaining feminine.
Homage to women of the two nations is
differently expressed. To an Englishwoman of
respectable upbringing there is something
frightening in being followed in the street;
she has a horror of the overture. It seems
to her to show a lack of respect, to place her
on the level of tfie facile , the too easily ap-
proached. It is an insult to her womanlv
pride, a detraction from her virtues. Not so
the Frenchwoman. Homage is homage, and,
though she will equally repel the stranger,
she will not feel her armour propre injured
thereby; on the contrary, she will experience
a secret glow of pleasure at the thought that
her charms have, been sufficient to evoke this
unsolicited tribute of the street. You ob-
serve the point of view ; how different it is.
It tinges everything To be “respected” in
the English sense would, to the French-
woman, appear to symbolise a want of love.
The bachelor party, -which is a common
feature in English social life, is unthinkable
in France. How can men enjoy themselves
without women? Woman is their enjoy-
ment. It is only the cold Englishman who
wants to leave his wife at home, whilst he
banquets or plays golf. The Frenchman’s
first essays in the royal and ancient game
are always accompanied by a feminine re-
tinue ; his wife, his aunt, and his mother-in-
law.
But new ideas are creeping in. Though
still 95 per cent, of marriages are arranged
,\ the parents, and during the six weeks’
engagements the fiances never see each other
alone, the tnariaye d’inclinaison is becom-
ing increasingly popular. And the equal
education of the sexes has its outer sign in
the “curious” fact mentioned by the author,
'that girls of 10 and 17 often walk alone to
their classes through the crowded streets of
1 aris—a thing impossible a few years ago ”
J*
One significant sign of the tendencies of
the age is the fact that, in this most modern
of modern nations, the drama is becoming
more important than literature.
, 0f the classics, Balzac sells; Moli&re
is used for school prizes and recitations;
Hugo is out of fashion, and there is none to
succeed.,.The theatre has become the great
tribune for the preaching of social reform,
and tor the discussion of questions of every-
day life. It is a powerful—perhaps the most
powerful—instrument in France to-day for
effecting changes The importance of the
theatre is seen in the attention given to it by
the press. Columns are devoted every day,
in the form of echoes, interviews or'critiques’
to stage problems, plays and players. The
book, on the contrary, has no reviews worthy
of the name Dramatists in the forward
rank have acquired the right to be regarded
as serious reformers. Eug&ne Brieux had a
place on the Extra-Parliamentary Commis-
sion to inquire into the causes of depopula-
tion. Paul Hervieu sat on a committee to
reform the Marriage Code.
There is no doubt that this nation has not
lost the habit of revolution. There is a
wide-spread discontent directed chiefly
against Parliament. The aim of the new re-
volutionaries is thus expressed by the
author: —
The idea of Emile Pataud, who is, cer-
tainly, the most prominent of the chiefs of
the new movement, is suddenly to suspend
the working life in France. The precise
hour of that suspension is a secret which re-
poses in the bosom of the Council of Twelve,
which constitutes the Inner Cabinet of the
Confederation Generale du Travail. There
exists a regular plan to cripple the com-
merce and industry of the country. At a
given moment the hand of labor will be
arrested. Trains will stop on the railways,
workmen will throw down their tools in the
workshops ; armies will stay on the march,
refusing to obey orders; every department
of public life will be paralysed. “The
Plan” amounts To a boycott by the
people of the ruling classes. This is
the secret dream of the Revolutionary. By
its means the facade of the Bourgeoise Con-
stitution will fall, leaving nakedness and
chaos. In its place, these, reorganisers of
society propose to erect a Government of
Syndicates or Trades Unions; Every class
in’ the community will be represented by a
body competent to speak for its interests.
The professional man, as well as the laborer,
the capitalist—if one can suppose a capital-
ist in the New France —and the salaried ser-
vant of the State, will combine to preserve
their social and political entities. It will
be a parliament of experts. The representa-
tive sent to that parliament will differ from
the Deputy in that he can be removed at the
first failure to give satisfaction to his con-
stituents. .. .The moment his views ceased
to be in harmony with the actual workers,
he would be recalled to take his place in the
ranks.
But in France two-thirds of the popula-
tion live in the villages and hamlets. The
one-third in the towns may sway things
momentarily, but, “not all the time.” This
is the conservatism of France, that great,
passive force—the blue-bloused peasant—
resisting innovations and brusque .changes of
regime. • ■
Wanted—a Sonnet in Australian
Not an Australian sonnet,, but a sonnet in
th'e Australian language. E. M. Clowes, in
her On the Wallaby, notes again and again
some phrase, or some use of words, that
struck her, an Englishwoman, as peculiarly
Australian. For example, our use of the
Word fair, in “a fair thing.” There are
many others that she did not mention.
Australia is moulding her heritage of the
Anglo-Saxon tongue to her own good uses,
just as the Yankee has developed his Ameri-
can language to his racial needs. ..This
page offers a guinea for the best sonnet in
Australian received by the end of January,
1912, There is no necessity for it to be
written in slang; but it must be a sonnet
that could not have been written, nor per-
haps thoroughly understood, without trans-
lation, outside of Australasia. Any sonnets
printed will, of course, be paid for.

A remarkably cheap and expensively illus-
trated series of art books is announced by
Heinemann, being a series of reproductions
of the great masters of engraving, with intro-
ductions by Arthur M. Hind. Each of the
half-crown volumes is devoted to a particu-
lar engraver or group of engravers, and con-
tains 64 pages of illustration, beautifully
reproduced on heavy paper. Two volumes
are to hand, Albrecht Barer and Andrea
Mantegna and the Italian Pre-Raphaelite
Engravers. In the former, the editor gives,
for the amateur, a useful explanation of the
difference between wood-cut, line engraving,
etching and dry-point. We have not many
etchers in Australia, but Lionel Lindsay

CURED.
THOSE PERSONS WHO SUFFER FROM AN/EMIA SHOULD READ THIS.
This letter is written by Mrs. J. J. Frost, of Port Adelaide, corner of Gran-
ville and Carlisle Streets, August 7, 1911: —
CLEMENTS TONIC, LTD.
“My present excellent health is due entirely to the virtues of Clements Tonic.
I suffered from Rheumatism for a long time. In spite of medical treatment, it
grew worse, until finally I got so had, that I could not even stand erect. My
suffering affected my general health, and my nervous system quite hrolce down. As
a last resource the doctors ordered me away for a change of air. Even that did not
benefit me. One day I read of a cure effected by Clements Tonic, and I decided
to give it a trial, with the happiest result. After taking five bottles I was free
from pain, and could get about. Seven bottles restored me to perfect health. lam
always recommending it to my friends.
(Signed) {MRS.) J. J. FROST.”
Mrs. Frost is but one of hundreds who recommend this medicine because they
know, by BENEFITS received, that their sick friends can obtain something beyond
price—lasting, robust health. Send to your CHEMIST and STORE for it
to-day. Do Not Wait Until To-mokeow. Health is always a true friend.

Long, Heavy Hair?
Then treat your hair well. See
that it is properly fed. Growth
of every kind demands proper
food. Starved hair splits at the
ends, turns prematurely gray,
keeps short and dry. Then feed
your hair. Feed it with proper
food, a regular hair-food. Feed
it with Ayer’s Hair Vigor. Thus
help nature all you possibly can
toward giving you rich, heavy,
luxuriant hair. Ask your doctor
about your hair and about Ayer’s

FLAT-CHESTED WOMEN!
Misfortune may have been your lot in so far natural de-
velopment was concerned, but science has found a way to cor-
rect your deficiency. Even though you have never been full-
bosomed, and although you have been attenuated all your
life, if you suffer from no wasting disease your bosom can be
fully developed and your weight increased to normal.
It is the refreshing firmness and delightful fulness of the
feminine form that captivates, and the woman who is most
perfectly developed is the one who monopolises the endear-
ments of the opposite sex.
No woman need stay thin and undeveloped. Dr. Falliere s

With the Twilight.
You’re the rose within the garden on the road
towards the ranges,
Where the dusty level changes to the cloudy
mountains high ;
But your little heart you harden, in your gar
den hesitating,
When the night and I are waiting and the
stars are in the sky.
All the hours of all the daylight, once they
lay along between us,
They lay along between us, but the time is
come to part:
I shall hold you in the twilight—ah, your
tresses blowing on me,
And your kisses laid upon me like red flowers
upon the heart!
Little eyes from out the garden, little sprite,
would you be biding,
Would your cruel self be hiding when you hear
my eager cry?
Would your wicked heart you harden? Ah,
come out and kiss your lover,
For the dusk is on the clover and the stars
are in the sky!

The Sweaters.
The Doctor and the Lawyer cantered gaily to
the West,
And they overtook the Farmer, and the three,
rode on abreast.
The learn&d men told crafty tales of doings
dark and dim,
Whose language and morality would shock
the cherubim ;
The Farmer rode in silence as their laughter
loudly rolled,
At the grim and sordid stories of their shame-
less lust for gold.
They passed a station homestead, and the
Doctor said : “ ’Twas here
I used to come three times a week for nearly
twenty year.
Old Dunn thought he was tottering upon the
Future’s brim,
So I treated him for everything that wasn't
wrong with him ;
And when I’d gone through each disease in
every blessed stage,
He died without my aid one night from over-
ripe old age.”
They passed another homestead, and the
Lawyer said: “McCann
Lived here; he was an ignorant and very
wealthy man.
I drew up his last testament, and firmly held
my jaws,
As I secreted carefully some dozen legal flaws ;
It made an interesting case, as lawyers can
attest- —
His heirs divided thirty bob, and we split up
the rest.”
And as they neared a farmhouse nestled in a
grove of trees,
The Farmer said: “I-lere lives a man I’ve
drained unto the lees;
I've sweated him from dawn to dark, I’ve
sapped his strength and soul.
For me he fought the forest, and he paid the
forest's toll;
I’ve cheated him of joy and love, I’ve cheated
him of years,
I’ve dried Ambition’s springs in him, I’ve
dried his well of tears.
“His sweat makes green these paddocks wide,
his hands have heaped my gold,
His slavery has seared his mind and made his
body old ;
And he has dug his grave down deep within
the clammy loam,
Perhaps he’ll reap his harvest there. . . .
Good-night, my friends, I’m home.”
They heard his children greet him, and his
merry laugh ring back,
And those two were very silent as they
ambled down the track.

Dreamin’ in the Park.
I don’t believe in graft or gain :
I likes ter sit an’ think
An’ do me graftin’ in me brain,
’Twixt drink an’ drink an’ drink;
Tor all ther things that wealth ’as bought,
An’ all ther toffs can shark,
I beats ’em, two ter one (in thought),
A-dreamin’ in ther park.
A motor-car goes whizzin’ past:
I dreams a better mote —
All green an’ gold, an’ twice as fast;
An’, in me leather coat,
I takes ther streets at topmost power—
There ain’t no Johns ter nark :
I docs me ’undred mile an ’our
A-dreamin’ in ther park.
A fat bloke passes with ’is girl,
A chorus tart, all gilt;
Ter wunst, all furs an’ rose-an’-pearl
I ’as me dream-tart built.
She beats to bits ther fat man’s flame,
As lively as a spark !
I runs a ’arem of the same
A-dreamin’ in ther park.
An’, if me trouser-ends is frayed,
The ones I wears in dreams
’As sapphires set along the braid,
Ah’ bank-notes, in ther seams :
Their checks is cheques, no bloomin’ kid !
No crease nor fault nor mark :
Each button is a shinin’ quid,
A-dreamin’ in ther park.
Sometimes I think hie life’s the top
Of any in ther town;
Me motor-cars can’t blow me up,
Me girls can’t take me down ;
Me wealth can’t give me quakin’ joints,
For fear of thieves at dark—
I tell yer, there’s a heap o’ points
In dreamin’ in ther park.
And then, some days, the dreams wear thin:
I see things clear an’ cold —
I ain’t got any car, nor tin,
Nor any girl to ’old ;
I’m just a skin o’ useless schemes —
A waster, sap an’ bark
My Gaird, the bitterness of dreams,
A-wakin’ in ther park!

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the liditor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “'The Editor, The Bulletin/’ is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official allays is.

THE TASMANIAN HAT AND THE
£2,000,000 WHICH MIGHT BE PUT
IN IT.
Theke is a little-known clause in the Aus-
tralian Constitution which empowers the
Commonwealth to lend a financial hand, on
such terms as it may think fit, to a State in
difficulties, and under this clause Tasmania
how holds out the faded belltopper of dis-
tress to its brethren of the mainland. The
Bulletin trusts that they will put money
into the article judiciously, yet generously.
It has long been alleged that owing to de-
fective accountancy during the first ten years
“bookkeeping period”—of Federation,
Tasmania didn’t receive its fair share of the
tariff revenue. A commission has looked
into the matter and reported that there is a
fair and just claim, but not a very large
'one, under this heading. It also decided
that the island needed a lot more than the
amount of its actual claim to drag it out of
the financial mire, and recommended a grant
of £900,000. Whereupon, of course, things
began to happen. Certain frenzied preachers
urged that Tasmania should receive nothing
—not even the bare amount said to be due
to it —unless it agreed to be of their way of
snuffle, and abolished Tattersall’s sweeps,
and sacrificed the revenue derived there-
from. Certain short-sighted Federal mem-
bers proceeded to suffer great anguish at the
idea of making any payment whatsoever.
The Federal Prime Minister hinted at his
willingness to maKe a grant payable by in-
stalments, but a much smaller one than the
amount suggested. And certain wildly ab-
surd members of the little State Assembly at
Hobart rushed forward with schemes _ for
spending the Federal grant when it arrived
—provided it did arrive. This folly naturally
furnishes arguments for the party which de-
sires to leave Tasmania in the lurch. If there is
a chance that the Lewis Government’s ma-
jority will revolt at the sight of cash—even
as a quantity of cats might rise in insurrec-
tion at the spectacle of raw meat —and start
a wild scramble for public expenditure, every
man scrambling for his own constituency, so
that in the end Tasmania will be. left very
much where it was, then there is a very
serious danger that no money will eventuate.
If a generous Christmas spirit happens to
be abroad, the Australian Parliament
might seriously consider the advisability of
taking over £1,000,000 of the Tasmanian
debt upon hard and fast conditions. A very
reasonable condition would be that one-half
the amount saved to the island taxpayer
should go to an additional sinking fund to
be held by the Federal Treasurer for the ex-
tinction of the balance of the debt, and the
other half be used for reproductive public
works, which would furnish some Tas-
manians with jobs and the Treasury at
Hobart with a steadily growing revenue.
That would involve some fresh adjustments
when all the State debts are taken over —
the aid might then have to be turned into a
cash grant—but, in the meantime, it would
represent a certain amount of relief. And
it would have the great advantage that there
would be no sudden heap of sovereigns for
wild-cat politicians at Hobart to scramble
for. If the aid, given in this fashion,
amounted to two millions instead of one it
would be an extra generous act, but not an
unwise one. In fact, under proper cohdi-
tions, it might be called supreme wisdom.
Then half the interest saved on the second
million might go to pay for reproductive
public works, and half be applied in reduc-
tion of taxes. But in this case there should
be two hard and fast stipulations: (1) That
Tasmania leaves off borrowing; (2) that the
utterly incapable Upper House at Hobart
shall dissolve itself for ever, and leave the
House of Assembly to run the whole show.
Tasmania’s House of Landlords, and the
Tory sentiment which it represents, have
been the chief cause of the little island’s
woes. And, incidentally, the State should
be called upon to cut off superfluous frills
especially to dispense with its State Gover-
nor and let the local Chief Justice do such
rubber-stamp business as is necessary. The
local Excellency at Hobart is the cheapest
Governor in the Commonwealth, so far as
actual cash goes, yet, in proportion to popu-
lation, he costs more than ally other vice-
regal person in these parts, save him of Wes-
tralia. And, in proportion to the general
wealth, he is the most expensive figurehead
of all.*
The fact that Tasmania is in a very diffi-
cult situation is shown by the tragic efforts
it makes to drag money out of its people by
direct taxation. The following table covers
a nine years’ record
Direct Taxation per Head per Annum.

N. S. Wales .. .. 16/1 15/1 l/~
These are the latest figures contained in the
Commonwealth Year Book, and since
they were published affairs have grown
worse With the folk of the Apple
Isle. The record shows that the poorest
of the States now carries a burden per head
of direct taxes double that of the two richest
States, and that it has had to heap up its
direct tax burdens in a remarkable fashion
during recent years. It hasn’t quite run
itself to a standstill, but some sort of stop-
page is almost in sight.
The Tasmanian press is fond of ascribing
these troubles to Federation and the conse-
quent loss of inter-State duties. But the other
States also lost their border duties, and in-
stead of a slump there was increased pros-
perity. If the vanishment of inter-State duties
caused the Tasmanian downfall, it can only
be assumed that the Tasmanian was the
most backward, ignorant and unenterprising
producer in the Commonwealth, and the only
one who couldn’t compete with his white
neighbors—his more highly-paid . white
neighbors—on equal terms. There is evi-
dence in the official statistics that he was
and is all these things. But the continuous
and lamentable fall in the railway revenue
proves that there is a dry-rot in the land
quite apart from any new tariff conditions.
And the fact is obvious that the dry-rot was
there long before there was any Common-
wealth or any internal Freetrade. By
some incredible set of circumstances it has
come to pass that the State which has the
best rainfall, the most fertile land, by far
the best yield of grain (when it has the
energy or the opportunity to plant grain), by
far the largest known stock of minerals in
proportion to its size, and also about the most
varied stock of minerals, the best supply of
water power for purposes of .Cheap manu-
facture, some of the best harbors, and the
most condensed population bar that of Vic-
toria (a circumstance which makes for eco-
nomical government)—the place, in short,
with every advantage —has been for . many
years the poorest of poor relations in the
Australian family. It might have been an-
other Belgium, but it preferred to be a pro-
spective bankrupt.
Tasmania’s ignorant and self-satisfied
Tory legislators have always had a
boundless faith in Private Enterprise and in
the importation of foreign capital. State
enterprise, which is at least a solid guaran-
tee that the profits will remain in the
country to relieve taxation, was always ab-
horrent to these old, dull fossils. As a re-
sult of their policy, lands, railways and in-
dustries came to be owned abroad to an ex-
tent unprecedented on the mainland. And
such joint-stock enterprises as were locally
established steadily passed into outside
hauds, for as a State becomes poorer under
misgovernment its best stocks and shares
always have a drift towards investors in
richer countries —unless the State inter-
feres with a strong hand, as the British
Government did to prevent the great Cunard
Steamship Co. becoming an American pro-
perty. Tasmania’s three banks became two.
The five fire insurance offices which it pos-
sessed in 3577 are now two, and very small
affairs at that. The one office which at-
tempted to do life insurance' closed up, and
Tasmania would have been horrified at the
idea of trying to keep this business in the
State by adopting the system of Govern-
ment life assurance, as Maoriland, and even
Great Britain, have done. Its steamship
company was allowed to sell out to the
Union of Maoriland. Once Hobart com-
peted with the now wonderful city of Glas-
gow as a shipbuilding centre, but its Tory
legislators didn’t think the industry worth
preserving, and in .1910 shipbuilding dropped
to the construction of three vessels with an
average capacity of 18 tons and an average
crew of four. Deliberately and of set pur-
pose, the bumptious landlords who have
always ruled the island, devoted themselves
to making Tasmania the land of absentees —
absentee "land-owners, mine-owners, railway
owners, tramway-owners, . water-power
owners, shipowners, Government security-
owners, hankers and insurance people. And
having learned nothing by the past, they are
still doing this sort of thing. The absentees
have bled Tasmania white by taking away
the earnings and the profits. The State has
become another Ireland without the advan-
tage, as in Ireland’s case, of politicians who
have a glimmering of the cause of the
trouble. And on top of everything else it
was always, in the old days, a Revenue
Tariff country, not charging Protectionist
duties to create and foster local industries,
but lumping a blind, futile, monotonous 20
per cent, on manufactured goods and raw
materials very much alike.
The aged and superior Tory incapables
kept their policy of ruin afloat as long as
possible with borrowed money. In the early
’6o’s of last century Tasmania owed nothing
at all. By 1899 it owed £7,969,841, of
which more than half (£4,042,547) had been
used for purposes which yielded no revenue
whatsoever. There is no other such hor-
rible example in Australian history. In 1910
the net debt was £10,570,453, of which some
£5,500,000 was unproductive. In other
words, for the past 50 years, about £lOO,OOO
a year of loan moneyI—more 1 —more than half the
total—has been used as revenue to bolster
up the accounts and hide the shameless in-
capacity of the gang in office, and this policy
has been maintained to the very last possible
moment. Now, apparently, the collapse is
in sight. It is not Federation that is the
trouble, nor inter-State Freetrade, nor the
paltry “leakages” during 'the book-keeping
period. It is simply the arrival of the in-
evitable. The (Raining of the country to
pay ments and interest 'and dividends to out-
side land-owners, mine-owners, money-
lenders —in fact, to the whole magnificent
gang of carefully cultivated absentees
keeps the country so poor that the railways
pay worse and worse. Nearly one-third of
the revenue goes to cover interest on unpro-
ductive debt. And the muddlers Who 1 have
brought this trouble about, instead of re-
signing and going to a lonely place to re-
pent in dust and ashes, hold out the hat to
the Commonwealth for aid.
All the same, something handsome must
be put in the hat. If Tasmania were to _de-
fault it would, be a hideously bad advertise-
ment for Australia. If it were to set about
saving money by closing up its schools, pr
some such desperate expedient, it would be
almost as bad. Tasmania, in its present
condition, is a dead loss to the Common-
wealth. It receives the same subsidy per
inhabitant as its neighbors, and contributes
so much less that it |s more distinctly a
pensioner than any other State. Timely
assistance may start it on a new career of
prosperity which may make it a profit to the
Commonwealth, while, on the other hand,
the lack of aid will almost certainly make the
situation a great : deal worse. But assist-
ance which merely relieves the pressure of
the moment, while leaving the original evil
where it was, is a mere postponement of the
day of reckoning. The amount offered should
be so large that it is possible to demand
large concessions in return, such as the stop-
page of borrowing, the abolition of the Tas-
manian Upper House, and the payment of,
say, £17,500 per annum to a new sinking-
fund. In return for the assumption of
£2,000,000 of the Tasmanian debt these con-
cessions might .fairly be demanded. And it
would pay the Commonwealth better, merely
looking at the sordid possibilities of the
island State as a future source of Federal
revenue, to take- over £2,000,000 of debt on
these terms than to give £200,000, without
conditions. In this matter the rank
and file of ..the islanders deserve more
sympathy than blame. In the early days,
Britain was a humorous old parent and
handed out constitutions promiscuously to
these States. .. To some it gave nominee
Upper Houses, ? which could be swamped by
new appointments, when they got in the way
of progress. To some it gave immovable
Upper Houses, composed of landlords and
elected by landlords. It was Tasmania’s
dreadful fuck to get about the most ne-
farious obstruction of the lot, and it has
never felt well since.
MANY INVENTIONS.
“Henry IIorsecollar” offers a few sug-
gestions :
There is at least this much to be said for Big-
john Forrest, of Westralia —-he is a man of high
courage and large ideas. And that is a great deal
to say of any man. If his financial methods were
less reckless, and his conservatism less lamentable,
Big John would rank among the' really Great. As
an instance of his pluck, consider his scheme, pub-
lished a month or two ago, for watering the > dry
lands along the Westralian section of the Kalgooriie-
Port Augusta railway. Water is already carried
some 400 or 500 miles, per medium of pipes, from
the coast to Kalgoorlie, That seems a big enough
enterprise; certainly there are very few like it on
this earth. Now BfGJOHN proposes to take the
water about 500 miles .further —to get more water
and bigger pipes, and tf* tackle the desert with both
hands. It is heroic. And yet, large as the idea is,
it isn’t quite large enough. It lacks novelty and
initiative. The inlands or bowels of Australia con-
stitute a huge problem, and the problem requires to
be treated on immense principles. The very first
essential, in my opinion, is to shut up the lower
channel of the Murray—to shove back the whole
river just as the N.S.W. Assembly’s Sergeant-at-arms
shoves the “Liberal’’ member who won’t apologise—
and divert the entire stream into the interior of the
country. At present, and for countless ages past, it
is and has been, the mission of the Murray to fall
aimlessly into the sea, not so very far south of the
place where the lowest part of Australia is crying
at the top of its voice for moisture, and offering a
basin to contain it. If a channel was out north-
ward from-about Renmark, through a low ridge, it
would be possible to drop the whole river with a
dull “plunk” into the great depression which bet-
toms around Lake Frome, Lake Blanche, and other
disappointing waterholes. After that the water
could look after itself, and meander away into S.A.
and Western Queensland, and the eastern part of the
Territory, doing good as it went. One of Australia’s
prize miseries is the spectacle of the Murray drip-
ping foolishly into the ocean, when the ocean doesn’t
want it, and the land wants it so very badly. I
don’t know how much this diversion would cost, but
I reckon it would be worth the amount, whatever
the amount might be.
Then, later on, it will probably be necessary for
the Commonwealth to consider ways and means of
bringing water from Tasmania. That island has a
multitude of rivers which it doesn’t in the least re-
quire for irrigation purposes. With all this stupen-
dous mass of cheap water power, the old isle of Van
Diemen should be the great, boss, overwhelming
manufacturing centre of the Commonwealth, but it
isn’t. That, however, has nothing to do with the
present question. The matter at issue is that Tas-
mania wants money badly, and it lias water to sell,
and the inlands of Australia want wafer even worse
than Tasmania wants money, and Australia can find
the money from Cohen or Mephibosheth, or some-
body, with which to pay for the water. It is only
necessary to consider how to deliver the goods.
Even such obscure streams as the .Pieman, Arthur,
King and Gordon would be worth cartloads of gold in
the Great Australian Depression, if they could be
turned into it, instead of drivelling uselessly into the
great, wide, salt, fish-haunted sea. As for a stream
like the Huon, Australia would gladly pay a tribute
of £IOO,OOO a year for it, and reckon it dirt cheap.
So far, unfortunately, it is impossible to send par-
cels, or heavy freight, or large quantities of loose
water by wireless telegram, though that will as-
suredly be done one of these days. But when water
is fetched nearly 500 miles in pipes to Kalgoorlie,
and it is proposed to carry it twice as far, even to
the S.A. border, why should not water be brought
from Tasmania to the mainland in huge pipes, laid,
like submarine cables, at the bottom of the sea?
(I assume that an embankment across Bass Straits
is out of the question until the business of engineer-
ing makes some further advances.) These pipes
would emerge on the coast of Victoria, and be car-
ried across country till they poured their, enormous
streams into the " Murray. The necessary pressure
could be easily got, for Central Victoria is a fairly
flat country. In fact, the great lakes of Tasmania
are four times higher than the ridge in Middle Vic-
toria, which the pipes would have to cross to reach
the Murray, so there would be pressure and to spare.
Then, the Murray being dammed up, as already
mentioned, the Tasmanian waters would also be di-
verted into the Great Inland Depression of Australia.
They would filter up to Lake Frome and Lake
Blanche, and carry the blessings of fertility with
them. And they would be streams of fresh water;
wherefore this idea is a million times better than
all the dreams and theories about letting the sea
into the Depression by a canal cut from Spencer’s
Gulf. Possibly the Italians may have to do that
sort of thing with the Sahara, so that the Atlantic
may wash up suddenly against the Arabs, and {take
Italy’s enemy in the rear, wetting his ammunition'
and scaring him and his, muddy-looking camel out
of such few wits as they possess. But Australia
wants something better than a Dead Sea in its in-
terior. It wants living waters, and Tasmania has
the goods to sell.
* * * *
It is not well to despair of Science, for it is im-
possible to even guess how far Science may go.
Already it has done such marvels as Hamlet’s con-
temporaries never dreamt - of. Some day, no doubt,
man will dig out that neglected toy, the burning-
glass, and start to construct it by millions on a
gigantic scale. Then he will plant rows and rows of
burning-glasses, each bigger than a hundred um-
brellas, all round the Antarctic regions, and thus
concentrate the rays of the summer sun on the ice
that has been accumulating thereabouts for Heaven
only knows how many billion ages, while men have
died, and worms have eaten them, and preachers
have preached over them. The heat will eat awav
the bases of the great ice masses, and they will
collapse and slide into the sea. Of course, new ice
will form in mid-winter, when the burning-glasses
aren’t working; but every year man, if he puts up
enough burning-glasses, and keeps moving them
further south, will gain a little, till at last he will
fight his way through mud and slush to the Pole
itself. In those days there will be so many billions
of icebergs at sea, and floating northward, that the
temperature will be greatly lowered for a number
of years, and people will catch severe colds on the
low-lying shores of Papua, and great bergs will
hamper traffic in the Bight of Benin, and along
Torres Strait. But that, of course, will be a
temporary inconvenience. It will pass as the ice
melts. Then, perhaps, whole frozen civilisations
and cathedrals and public debts will be found where
the ice used to be —but that is a mere theory and a
side issue. Whether the freeing of all this pent-up
water will so raise the level of the sea that Darling
Harbor (Sydney) will come right up to Pfahlert’s
Hotel, in Wynyard Square, cannot be decided till
the burning-glass gets really to work. If there is
such a rising of the waters, and the P. and 0.
steamer is able to unload beer and soft goods in
York-street, it will, in my opinion, be a great con-
venience. Then there will be wharfage all the way
no Lane Cove, and the Orient boats will berth at
Parramatta.
Failing something of this sort, it must be plain
to the most casual observer that there is an impera-
tive demand for great improvements at Sydney.
That city’s picturesque harbor is up against a cer-
tain amount of trouble. It isn’t deep enough for
45,000-ton steamers, and its rocky bottom doesn't
lend itself to dredging. The channels are hardly
wide enough for the best modern vessels to turn or
manoeuvre in, and they are crooked channels, and
much hampered by islands. But the great difficulty
is that all the northern part of the deep water sec-
tion is too precipitous to be of much use for wharf-
age purposes, and a great deal of the southern part
is similarly afflicted. Circular Quay is good and
level and handy, but there isn’t enough of Circular
Quay. Beyond it, going towards Darling Harbor or
Balmain, there is a steep hill, and Darling Harbor
itself is disadvantaged by the fact that goods landed
there have to be dragged up a ridge which is trying
even to an unloaded cab-horse, before they reach
William McMillan’s warehouse. This ridge is in-
fested by cheap public houses, in some of which the
beer is simply dreadful. Probably the best way to
double or treble the shipping facilities of Sydney
would be to dig out or blast away this ridge, and
pour the broken material into the hollow of George
and Pitt streets, so as to make a gentle and per-
fectly smooth slope from Darling Harbor to Castle-
reagh-street. It would, of course, be a work of some
magnitude. When it was finished, the hollow at
Brickfield Hill would be filled in. Pitt-street would
be so elevated that only the top fraction of the new
A.M.P. building would appear above the surface.
On the other hand, Wynyard Square and the
streets, leading into it would be cut down enor-
mously, and there would be a practically level road
from Circular Quay to O’Sullivan’s remarkable
railway station, which the Labor Government is now
about to finish by putting an absurdly expensive fool
of a roof on it. If the Rocks district was also
levelled, there would probably be about a million
train-loads of surplus material, even after all the
necessary filling-in was done. A lot of this could be
used to raise the low-lying lands beyond Newtown
and Stanmore, and the balance could be sent out
West to help in damming the Murray as afore-
mentioned. Later on, when still more wharf ac-
commodation was wanted, the islands might be
rooted out of the harbor, and the Domain levelled;
and the William-street hill, where the’ bus hofses
used to die of heart-failure, might be removed, so
a;s-to provide a flat surface from Darling Harbor to
Double Bay. This would make the whole shore-line
jfrom the eastern end of Double Bay to Pyrmont
available for shipping. And the superfluous material
dug out could be used to build a breakwater at
Coogee, so that Sydney would have an Outer Harbor
after the fashion of Adelaide, and Randwick could
become a great commercial centre.
* * * *
I do not propose, of course, that Australia should
rush simultaneously at these and other necessary im-
provements, and attempt to do them all at once.
Time and patience are great essentials. But with
time and patience and enterprise, nothing is im-
possible. When the airship comes into steady use
as a means of traffic, an effort should especially be
made to create a chain of hills down Central Aus-
tralia, in order to improve the climate. Every

that the best cure for the prickly-pear curse is to
throw it down deserted shafts. Australia—
and more especially Victoria —has thousands ot
these, a.id is always acquiring more. there
are enough of them to hold all the prickly-pear in
Australia many times over. If they were crowded
with tig'htly-rammed pear to within 3ft. of the sur-
face, and then filled in, the floor of Australia would
be much safer to walk on than it is. Also, the rich
vegetable mould thus formed —in some places
3000 ft. or 4000 ft. deep—would be something of an
asset. A shady tree could be planted above each
shaft for the Oldest Inhabitant to sit and discourse
under. One of this country’s great needs is some
better accommodation than the threepenny bar for
tbe Oldest Inhabitant when he is in a discourseful

The Ships that Australia Used to Build.
The Fisher Government proposes to do a
little this session in the way of repairing
tariff anomalies, and though it doesn’t. pro-
pose very much what it does propose is
much better than nothing. Notably, its sug-
gestions include a 80 per cent, duty
(with a 5 per cent, rebate in favor
of Britain) on imported ships, “not
exceeding 400 tons gross register.” This is
a blessed new departure, though the idea
that all vessels over 400 tons should be im-
ported free shows a strange clinging to the
tail of the old superstition that somehow the
shipbuilding industry should not be pro-
tected. It was a tine, promising industry in
these States till the advent of iron and steel
ships; then it began to die out because,
through lack of Protection, there was no big
iron or steel industry. N.S.W. launched its
first ship in 1789. It launched others in
1798, 1803, 1804, 1805 (a full-rigged ship),
1807 (three ships, one for the India trade),
and, so on. A steamer was built on the
Williams River in 1831, and Melbourne
built its first steamer in 1841. The
first war vessel built at Sydney was
launched in 1854, and two more small
odes took the water in 1872. A little
iron steamer was built at Melbourne in 1874.
tn 1876 no less than 60 vessels were built in
N.S.W.; in 1877, 61 were built; and the
trade improved till 102(52 of them steamers)
were Constructed in 1883, and 103 (64 of
thbid steamers) in 1884. Some of these
were sturdy ocean-going craft, and were
fairly large, according to the standard of
that day; and many were compiled on har-
bors and inlets where now there is no busi-
ness and little population, thanks to the
policy of dragging everything to Sydney. But
tinder the curse of Freetrade the industry of
Composing ships began to die out in N.S.W.-,
till, in 1895, it was less than a tenth of what
If had been in 1884. The slump of Tas-
mania was even worse than that of N.S.W.
—in fact, the tendency was everywhere
downward. It is worth while trying to revive
this decayed but honorable old job, and the
attempt shouldn’t stop at vessels of 400 tons.
It shouldn’t even stop at vessels of 4000 tons.

Another Bloodless Revolution.
Socialistic legislation, the article which,
according to “Liberalism” is going to in-
volve Australia in eternal smash the day
after to-morrow, if not sooner, put in some
more of its deadly work last week. In the
Court of Arbitration Justice Higgins laid,
down, in effect, the original, not to say un-
precedented doctrine that the seaman is not
a beast of burden; in fact, he propounded
the theory that those who go down to the
sea in ships are not beasts at all, but human
beings, and possessed of the same social and
other rights as wharf-lumpers, shop hands,
etc. Five years ago, to say nothing of 10 or
20 years ago, the average commercial man,
and unimaginative dullards generally,
would have called epileptically upon Heaven
to witness that raving mania was afoot had
someone advanced the view that an eight-
hour day for sailors was a fair thing. For
1000 years or more the seafarer has been
working for four hours at night, then turn-
ing in for four hours, then rolling out of his
bunk and falling to for a further four hours,
and so on. It is impossible to estimate how
many wrecks have occurred, how many lives
have been lost, and how much valuable pro-
perty has vanished to the ocean depths as a
result of that demented arrangement. One
of the few things one can say with cer-
tainty in this connection, is that had
“Liberalism” or anti-Socialism or whatever
the time-is-not-ripe section labels itself for
the moment, had any voice in the matter, the
system would never have been assailed. The
attitude of the people whom George Reid
and his following used to call “Anarchists ”
is that a sailor is as liable to be still sleepy
after four hours’ sleep, as (say) a brick-
layer or a Judge or a remittance-man; that
it is particularly undesirable that sailors
should be sleepy during business hours (dis-
tressing proofs of which have been afforded
round the Australian coast in the last few
months) ; and that, anyhow, no man should
be liabituallv torn out of bed before he has
enjoyed anything like the minimum quan-
tity of rest that Nature demands. And so,
from July 1, 1912, there will be inaugurated,,
in Australian waters, a system under which
seamen will work for four hours and then
take eight hours off, fall to again for another
four hours, and follow that by another eight
hours off—or, in other words, embark on the
eight hours work, eight hours sleep and
eight hours play schedule, which the modern
world recognises to be the right and healthy
thing for manual laborers ashore. About
the only serious objection lodged against
the above reform was that the sailors would-
be liable to abuse their eight hours’ leisure
—a dread based, probably, on the idea that,
with no pub handy, the sea-going Person
would necessarily be at a loose end. The
Socialistic contention was. that the sailor
would find as many ways, if not more ways,
of doing a bit of good for himself, mentally,
physically, etc., in his leisure moments at
sea, as anywhere else. And it went. Be-
side this vast revolution of an eight-hour
day on the ocean, the slight increase in sea-
men’s wages (the first in 24 years) that is
granted under Higgins’s award. _ appears
trivial. It is certain that Australia s lead,
as regards the greater reform, will be fol-
-1 >wod shortly by the rest of the civilised
World. But that need cause no wonder-
ment It is the fate of most of what Bruce
Smith calls “Labors wild and revolution-
ary experiments.”
The Gold Reserve.
Pbime Minister Fisiier develops a
strange capacity for playing into the hands
of his enemies over the Federal note issue.
When he began this business, he was strongly
urged to adopt the successful Canadian sys-
tem, whereby the banks are required to hold
40 per cfent. of their cash reserves in Federal
paper. This gives a certain fixity to the cir-
culation, and prevents the Government being
rushed in a wholesale way for cash. Fisher,
who seems to accept advice only from his
opponents, took no notice of the suggestion.
It was put before him that the coin received
in exchange for notes—apart from that re-
quired as a reserve —might well be employed
as a sinking fund to accumulate at com-
pound interest for the repurchase of State
securities, and that the good work might be
begun on favorable terms by buying up the
cheapest available securities in the open
market. Thereby he would have done three
good deeds at once —made a beginning at the
work of taking over the State debts, made a
beginning at the repayment of the State
debts, and backed his note issue with an ever
increasing mass of saleable securities. None
of these ideas appealed to Fisher either. His
Federal note issue, in its original form, was
backed by a 25 per cent, gold reserve for the
first £7,000,000 of notes, while on all notes
issued above £7,000,000, £1 of gold was to
be - held against every £1 of paper. That
meant that if £12,000,000 worth of notes
were issued, the gold reserve must be at
least £6,750,000, while against £20,000,000 of
notes it must be at least £14,750,000. Under
no circumstances could the Commonwealth
get the use of more than £5,750,000. It
seemed an absurdly large amount to keep
lying idle, yet when the Commonwealth had
to depend wholly on the forbearance of the
banks to prevent a huge, simultaneous cash-
ing of the notes, a large reserve was neces-
sary. In those early days, the enemies of the
Fisiier Government were fond of declaring
that it would presently find the temptation
too much for it, and would break in on the
reserve; and, apparently, they were right.
The number of notes taken by the banks is
larger than was expected, and. consequently,
the gold reserve is larger, and the risk of a
great, sudden demand for cash is larger, also.
And the joint-stock banks, being more or
less aggravated by the proposal to start a
Bank of the Commonwealth, probably feel
more like making that sudden demand than
they ever did before. The Fisiier Govern-
ment selects this moment to propose a reduc-
tion of the legal cash reserve to 25 per cent.,
so that it will be necessary only to hold
£3,000,000 against £12,000,000 of notes, in-
stead of £6,750,000. Yet, apparently, it is
not proposed to take any precautions—such
as the Canadian idea already alluded to
to prevent sudden and violent presentation.
A legal cash reserve is a curious sort of ani-
mal for if £3,000,000 is held against an issue
of £12,000,000, there isn’t a single sovereign
really available; to cash a solitary £1 note
would reduce the reserve ss. below the legal
limit, and would be an unlawful act. Even
with a £10,000,000 issue and a £3,000,000 re-
serve, it would only be legally possible to
cash £666,666 worth of notes. To pay
out another £1 would make the reserve os.
below the legal limit. If the proposed, reduc-
tion of the reserve is made, and. the situation
is otherwise unaltered — i.e., if the unex-
pectedly large liability is still only kept afloat
by the kindness of embittered and hostile in-
stitutions—the Fisiier Government will
be takimr big risks. Whether anybody took
a few million extra notes in the hope that the
«featness of the gold reserve would be an
extra temptation to the Government to break
into : it, as it proposes doing, and m order
that the greatness of the issue would make
the trouble bigger when the notes were
dumped dow r n for payment, it is impossible
to say. What is visible to the naked eye is
ithat the reserve is to be reduced because(l)
the liabilities payable on demand have in-
creased, and (2) because the creditor is pro-
bably'more - furious than he used to be.

The Sorrows of Wade.
C G Wade has been playing lead, for the
Ntii time in a revival of “Virtue Calum-
niated,” that well and unfavorably known
political drama with which N. S>\ ales has
been afflicted,?o -dtep, of late. eternal
question that faces the aud.ence In this pro-
duction may be stated as follows: Are all
classes in the community engaged in a con-
spiracy to grossly misrepresent Wade, or
not? Works Minister Griffith is the
latest to undertake the role of main villain.
He claimed, the other day, that Wade said,
at Goolah, on October 24: —-
The Labor Government does not- mind spending 2 A
millions on a North; Shore bridge for the people of
Sydney. The money would be far better spent in
the country, opening up the land and constructing
railways, etc.
Now, while such sentiments go well enough
in the backblocks, they are the very devil
in Sydney and environs. Wade gave Grif-
fith the lie direct as to the whole affair.
Griffith riposted with a quotation from the
Coolali Advocate’s report of Wade’s
speech wherein it was alleged that Wade
said precisely what Griffith said he said.
Wade replied that the paper had misre-
ported him ; in fact, he said that the Advo-
cate’s reporter had deliberately drawn
him aside after the meeting and explained
that he (the reporter) was bogus, and
incapable of writing shorthand. The re-
porter infuriatedly denied in the press,
next day, that he had been guilty of any
such demented action; and underneath ap-
peared the following :
We, the undersigned residents of Coolah, hereby
state that we were present at Mr. Wade’s meeting
at Webb’s Hall, Goolah, on the night of the 24th
October, and during that gentleman’s address he
spoke of the building of the North Shore bridge by
the Government as a waste of money, which would
be better spent by building railways in the country.
We have seen the report of Mr. Wade's address, pub-
lished in the Coolah Advocate, dated October 25,
and we declare that it is a true report in every re-
spect of the words used by that gentleman, while
speaking on the matter. (Sgd.) John Gilmore,
George Archer, H. Whitfield, Alfred Neale,
John S. Halt, Trips. J. McCauley, George Hum-
phries.
Wade reiterated, in response to the above,
that everyone was inaccurate, bar one, and
concluded with this somewhat incoherent
cry of grief:—
It is very pitiful of Mr. Griffith to allow his
personal hostility towards me to invariably warp his
judgment with regard to these questions, and on
every matter of public interest with which 1 am con-
cerned, to endeavor to drag in some party feeling;
to discredit me and likewise injure a great body of
electors. I have no hesitation in affirming what 1
previously said, namely, that I denounced freely at
every meeting this wild scheme of Socialism and
State quarries, brickworks and ferries, which were
all centred in Sydney for the benefit of a few local
people, when the money spent on these projects could
have been more beneficially expended in opening up
the country.
In weighing the facts of a case like this
one naturally turns to the alleged martyr’s
record. Wade’s is a poor one. Two or three
years ago, for example, Chief Justice
Darley was granted a year’s leave of ab-
sence, on full pay, by the Wade Govern-
ment. The job was flagrant enough to pro-
voke an uproar, in which even the “Liberal
press joined. In extenuation, Wade explained
“that he couldn’t well refuse the request of
an old and tried public servant.” Darley s
friends weighed in with horrified denials of
the possibility of the C.J. having begged for
the dole. Proudly, coldly, Wade “left it to
the country” to judge who was telling the
truth in the matter. Yet, later, when the
scandal was thrashed out in Parliament,
Wade coyly owned that Darley’s friends
were right, and that the “old and tried pub-
lic servant” had not asked for the conces-
sion. Consider, again, the Mount Kembla
affair. N. S. Wales “Liberalism” almost
made Wade’s heroism at Mount Kembla
an issue of its 1910 campaign. The “Lib-
eral” papers referred repeatedly to the des-
perate courage their leader had displayed in
diving into the gassy bowels of the _ earth to
rescue a gang of ungrateful working men.
Wade lodged no protests. Finally, at a
banquet in the Sydney Town Hall, Joseph
Carrutiters, that Emperor- of Leg-Pullers,
pointing dramatically at Wade, said {vide
Sydney Telegraph) :
Mr. Wade had been vilified during the elections in
a most scandalous manner. (Hear, hear.) He had
even been called a coward. (Loud laughter.) But
he (Carruthers) would ask them if his action in
going into the mine, at the time of the South
Coast colliery disaster, was the act of a coward?
(Loud and sustained applause.) A monument had
been erected in memory of Major MacCabe, who lost
his life in attempting to save others, and they came
near to having to erect a monument to Mr. W ade
for the same thing.
And still C. G. Wade lodged no protests.
Later, when it transpired that it was an-
other Wade who had gone down the Mount
Kembla mine, and when folks started ask-
ing why this vital fact hadn’t been men-
tioned before— immediately after Car-
ruthers’s speech, for example—the “Lib-
eral” leader fell back on the usual old gag
about “misrepresentation,” and all the rest.
The McKye case, where, it was shown that
Wade had, against the will of the Judg'e
who tried the matter, remitted half the well-
earned fine of a prominent North Sydney
Anti-Laborite; the Ben Abdaii affair,
where the Wade Government was proved
to have freed a Syrian criminal, of in-
fluence in Redfern, at the. request of J. L.
Began, who was contesting the constitu-
ency in the “Liberal” interests —these, and
a crowd of other charges like them, have
wrung from Wade the Same old cry, viz.,
(1) they are false; (2) they emanate from per-
sons of “warped judgment,” consumed with
personal hostility towards him and hence
incapable of distinguishing the true from
the false. It suggests an almost unnatural
capacity for being wronged and misunder-
stood on the part of Wade.
The Poor Excuse that Is Better than None.
The State Governments of this more or less
blessed country are never short of an excuse
to avoid any attempt at fiercely honest
finance, and the McGowen Ministry of
N.S.W. is just like its neighbors in that re-
spect. It had, a little while ago, a virtuous
spasm—a spasm about the size of a stomach-
ache in a peanut, but still something with
pretensions to be a spasm. It proposed to
keep a separate account of the receipts from
public works, and to set aside any profits—
i.e., any sums over and above working ex-
penses and interest on borrowed money—as
a fund for maintenance, repair and possibly
for extension. As the works must be main-
tained and repaired in any case, the sugges-
tion didn’t amount a violent reform, still
there was a commendable trace of foresight
about it. But now, even this small improve-
ment has burst, under a curious combination
of circumstances. The railways, Treasurer
Dacey announces, are not to be included in
the arrangement until they have paid back
the £2,.000,000 which they owe to the
revenue, and perhaps not even then. Tips
is the basis of the trouble: Years ago,
sometime between Pontius Pilate and
Petek Jackson, the N.S.W. railways
“didn’t pay.” That is to say, the people ot
that time —many of whom are now dead
didn’t charge themselves high enough fares
and freights to cover interest and expenses,
so they paid the balance out of taxes or
loan money, or land sales —in fact, as they
didn’t pay it one way they paid it another
way, and if the other way hadn’t been so
dashed immoral at times, it would have been
as broad as it was long. The accumulated
railway shortage—in other words, the amount
which these old people paid one way instead
of paying it the other —climbed up to
£7,0(10,000, or £5,000,000, or 2d., or
£9,000,000, or something like tp£—it was a
mere bookkeeping entry, anyhow. Then it
diminished to £2,000,000 —that is to say, the
people who used to pay less one way (in
fares), and more another way (in taxes,
etc.), took to paying more one way and less
another way, and, where it had been as broad
as it was long, it became, instead, as long
as it was broad. Now, Treasurer Dacey
says that, until this last £2,000,000 which
the railways “owe” to the general revenue is
paid, he can’t conscientiously let the railway
surplus go into a repairs and renewals
fund. In other words, because.some people
(more or less dead) paid less fares and
more taxes, all reform is postponed till some
other people (still alive) pay more fares and
less taxes to a corresponding extent. Yet
the present people didn’t lose anything, be-
cause the dead people preferred Jo pay one
way rather than another. They have no
claim on the dead people’s money, and they
couldn’t get it, anyhow, not even if tljey
seized the tombstone for arrears. If the
railways do pay back the £2,000,000 they
“owe” to the revenue, it will merely be a
case of the live people paying themselves
their own money, just as tlie dead
people did. and they won’t be a cent
better off or worse off. The situation would
be just as foolish if Britain reckoned up
how much the Tower of London has cost
the Treasury since the days of William I.
and decided that it couldn’t repave the
Strand until the money was refunded. It is
a very thin excuse, put forward by a very
thick Treasurer, for postponing a very small
financial reform; but when the desire to
reform is a sham, any excuse will do.
The Landloafers on the Irrigation Areas.
Victoria’s irrigation expert, Elwood Mead,
is full up of telling the vv'eary Ministry
what should be done to make closer settle-
ment and intense culture profitable, so lie
and his fellow Commissioners propose to
tackle the task themselves, and, unfortu-
nately, they can only do it in a cumbersome
and ineffective manner. Mead points out
that irrigation doesn’t pay where wheat and
the native grasses are the leading crops, but
that fruit, vegetables for canning, sugar
beet, tobacco and other comparatively high-
priced goods must be raised ; also, the land
must be cultivated and the ivdter used.. To
be self-supporting, Rodney district must
pay the State £22,000 a year; but that
amount never has come in, or anywhere near
it, and this year the deficit is estimated at
£4OOO. There have been no payments to-
wards the redemption fund, and there is no
prospect of there being any. Rodney dis-
trict, for which primarily the huge Waranga
Basin was constructed, has 200,000 acres, of
irrigable land, and 600 miles of distributing
channels, yet, last season, less than 2 per
cent, of the flow of the Goulburn was used,
and the Waranga Basin was almost full at
the end of the season. The huge outlag on
that construction brought no return. The
district, instead of having a family settled
on each 50 or GO acres, is practically empty.
Coomboona parish, of 21 square miles, has
93 souls, men, women and children; Gir-
garee East has 320 on 36 square miles; Tar-
ipta, which includes the much-boomed
Wyuna Settlement, has only 11 persons per
square mile. Excluding the townships of
Merrigum, Mooroopuna, Kyabram and Tat-
ura, the entire district has less than 10 souls
to the square mile. This loss of great , op-
portunities, and waste of good money, gives
Mead the pip, so he proposes to increase the
price of the water. It is, he says, the best
thing he can do; but it isn’t the right
thing. It means that the energetic, scien-
tific cultivator, the citizen whom the State
so urgently needs, will have a harder task
than before, while the lazy landholder or
jobbing .speculator will contribute not one
additional penny towards paying the ex-
penses of the scheme that has put, and will
in future put, thousands into his pocket,
The proper thing, which Mead cannot do,
but which Weary and Co. can, is to levy
on the land served by the channels a suffi-
ciently heavy rate to pay the whole bill,
whether the landowner uses the'water or not.
The rate may be levied on the unim-
proved value or the irrigable value, or. the
bare acreage, but every scrap of soil within
reach of the water should be made to pay.
The State wouldn’.t be out of pocket every
year then, and the genuine cultivator would
be vastly better off. The lazy land monopo-
list and the increased-values speculator
woo'd doubtle c « moan niteouslv, but this
nauer believes they would speedily quit that
foolishness, and start cultivating, or sell out
to someone who would-

At morn before the east is red
We’re hurried, pell-mell, out of bed ;
For hours we’re on the milking stool,

And there the hot, iron roof, the hum,

And, while we really try to learn,
To be asleep in bed we yearn;

More lessons to be drudged at still.

IF THEY INVESTED IN PIIORLKTY. N.S.IV. State
Treasurer Dacey.
The present N.S.W. Government lias done
various tilings which surprised those who
judged it by its progiamme, but in its
capacity as a special discriminator in favor of
the landlord and money-lender, it strikes what
migat be called the limit. The new income-
tax reduces the exemption as regards a pri-
vate individual to £309. On the first £ioo
after that (i.e., from £3OO up to £1000),
piovkled the income is earned by personal
exertion, or by usury, or trading, or theft,
he will pay 6d. in the £ (Bd. if the
income is derived from property, or if the
owner is an absentee ; and 10d. if the income
is derived from property, and the owner is an
absentee). On the next £lOOO (£lOOO to
£2000) the rate will be 7d. in the £, and so
on up to Is. in the £ on so much of the
income as exceeds £9700 a year, with the same
one-third increase on the property owner and
one-third on the absentee. But —and this is
where the amazing part of the business
comes in—the company, even though it may
be a very small, hard-up company, consisting
of a group of working partners, is to get no
exemption at all, and is to pay Is 2d in the
£ all round, which is just the amount the
very biggest company pays; and the local
company is to get no advantage what-
ever as against the foreign one, which
works abroad, with low-wage and long-
hour labor, and sends its goods here
over the wall of a very inefficient tariff. The
company, in a very large proportion of cases,
represents plain, hard. Australian industry—
quarrying, rubber-making, carrying, baking,
engineering, furniture-making and the like.
And often it is a very small affair: there are
26 industrial companies on the Sydney share
list with less than £50,000 paid-up capital,
and the capitals go as low as £6250. The
idea of marking these out for heavier taxa-
tion than the landlord —especially the absen-
tee landlord—and the financier looks like rav-
ing Toryism or anti-Australianism. Here
are some calculations as to how the figures
will work out: —
Income Tax on Various Kinds of Income.
Profits
of company

5000.. 155 0 0 206 13 4 258 6 8 291 13 4
There are intermediate stages, of course, at
all of which the advantage is against the
local . company. Even this benefit given to
the rich landlord—including the rich absen-
tee landlord —or the money-lender, with
£5OOO a year for his own spending, as
against the little local manufacturing co.
whose £5OOO may mean an average of about
£2 a week to 100 shareholders, isn’t every-
thing. For the private taxpayer receives con-
cessions according to the number of his chil-
dren, and the company, of course, doesn’t.
Apparently, the idea is to wholly nullify the
i l an< J tax, and to put the absentee
landlord on as good a footing as the Aus-
tralian manufacturer. In reality, it is likely,
except where he is a specially huge landlord,
to put him on a much better footing. The
landlord doesn’t pay land tax on his house
property, but only on the bit of earth under-
neath his shops and dwellings, and the manu-
facturing co. is under exactly the same disa-
bility Very often it has to own quite a
valuable bit of land, in order to carry on its
business, and, being a small co., has raised
the money to pay for it by the sale of de-
And, as it can’t cut up the land
and sell it in small allotments to escape the
tax, without breaking up its business, it has
to hang on and pay upon the higher scale,
therefore, the local manufacturing co. may
be as big a contributor to the land tax as
the absentee landlord with a similar income,
in addition to being a much larger contribu-
tor to the income tax. This special discrim-
ination against Australian industry, and in
favor of the landlord, including the
absentee landlord, promises to be a severe
blow to a class which already finds it difficult
to hold its own against foreign imports.
And it puts the N.S.W. Labor party in quite
a new light. The yearning after the land-
lord and the individual capitalist is a fresh
development.
The 111-Paid Pedagogue.
These are woefully bad times for school-
teachers and other ill-paid classes of the
civil service. The average city landlord is
now putting up the rent two or three times
a year. Nearly every organised worker out-
side the civil service has struck for a rise
or three rises, and got it—or them.
All these things are gaily shoving up the
post of living, yet the teacher doesn’t get a
. hean beyond the pay that was fixed
V? very different days and under very
different circumstances, and his scanty
comes round in the same leaden-
tooted fashion as of old. He belongs to a
class which finds it a long time between
hr'Hhs. N. S. Wales pays as well as any of
the States, and, even there, it is only after
eight _ years of strenuous study (four years
practically without pay), severe examina-
tions and good luck, that the pedagogue
climbs to a maximum wage which is on the
same level with the minimum paid to boiler-
makers and some other artisans. His work-
ing hours are longer than the boiler-maker’s,
and lie has to go here or there as he is sent,
and can’t choose his own place of residence,
which is often a serious unpleasantness.
And if he is sacked, that practically ends
his career, for the Government is his em-
ployer, and when he is “fired” (say)
in Bathurst, that means that he is
equally. “tired” in everv town, village and
hamlet in the State, and discredited in every
other State. These disadvantages ought to
get him extra consideration, but, instead,
they are used against him by mean Govern-
ments. Because he is less able than other
men to demand more he gets less, even
though he may deserve a greater amount.
When the Sydney wharf laborers, after get-
ting two or three increases in quick suc-
cession, struck for more pay, the N.S.W.
I abor Government refused to enforce the
law against them. But if the teachers, who
have never got even one increase outside the
letter of their contract, were to strike for an
extra 6d., no one doubts that their reward
would be plain, blank, unvarnished sack. Their
best hope seems to lie in affiliation with the
Trades Hall. Then, if they are driven
to strike for decent pay, they may perhaps
get the butchers and gas-stokers to back them
up, and cut off the Ministerial chop and gas-
.jet till they get redress. The teachers, as it
hnppens, can’t make the community sit
up by their own action, as can railway men
and bakers. They can certainly turn off
scluol at the meter, but a lot of parents
would be rather glad than otherwise, and
would send their progeny milking or rabbit-
tins-. Twelve hours’ stoppage of the
creamery would break up that kind of parent
more than 12 years’ stoppage of the academy.

From The Bulletin’s Aged Warrior
The Dago-Turkish affair looks like settling down
into a military Marathon contest ; in which case my
m f°Ki ey i S ?u t n, at incomparable long-distance shedder-
ol-biood, the lurk. Already, we have the spectacle
ot the usual old see-saw that goes on when two fairly
equal lines of men behind trenches rush each other,
and alternately take, and are driven out of, each
other s positions. It looks as though the Italians
and their prey will go on grinning at each other
over the tops of their trenches till they are grey-
headed, or, which is more likely, till the Dago king-
coin is forced to file its schedule. The country is
miserably poor, with very little in the industrial'line
to support it except in the north—Piedmont and Genoa.
Ihe south is mainly fruit, fish and lazzaroni, with
volcanic accessories, and reminiscences of a once- 1
flourishing system of brigandage. According to the
cables the war is costing Italy 2J millions a month,
which is-to say £30,000,000 a year. It is a lot to
outlay on a profitable war, and war with Turkey has
never been a paying spec, for anyone. The ridiculous,
comic opera blockade of the coast of European Turkey
can hurt no one but the Italians themselves. They
have already lost the profits of the sponge-fishery for
the year They have lost the large percentage of
lurkish trade that used to go through their country
and, to all appearance, they are feeling the pinch of
want. The financial question should beat Italy, even
if its army doesn’t lose a fight.
John Kelly lately went on to the farm of
James Dennis, of Wagga
tJN.fc.W.). in the subsequent court pro-
ceedings for trespass, it was not contended
that J. Kelly ate any of W. J. Dennis’s
grass, or burned any of W. J. Dennis’s
crops, or butchered, or violently assaulted, or
even spoke disrespectfully to W. J. Den-
nis s live stock. J. Kelly just went on to
W. J. Dennis s “property.” But when he
went J. Kelly made the mistake of doing so
to enrol W. J. Dennis’s farm hands in the
Rura! Workers’ Union, and G. Stevenson,
1 .M., remarked that the error would cost J.
Kelly £5 fine, £2 2s. professional costs, £1
witnesses expenses, and 7s. costs of court, or
three months’ gaol. Now, if John Kelly had
gone on to W. J. Dennis’s premises to sell
the farm-hands the Holy Scriptures, or to
enrol them as members of the Society for
the Propagation of the Gospel among the
latagomans, how much would George
Stevenson, P.M., have fined him? One
shilling t Possibly. In view of which it
looks as though John Kelly was fined the
extra 995., not for tresoass, but for being an
organiser of the Rural Workers’ Union.
One who signed himself “Freeholder” re-
cently wrote to the Sydney dailies declar-
ing himself a “Liberal,” a Freetrader and
an upholder of the freehold as against Gov-
ernment leasehold. Said he: —
. Why not a political party of freeholders, whose ob-
ject would be to promote and uphold a principle—
innate almost in human nature itself —the right to
possess a home which one can call his own.
The Bulletin thinks of joining that party.
It seems right that every man should have
a home of his own. And how can he do it
it Antill and Macarthur Onslow and
Cooper and people like that will only
give him a lease, and possibly a very
short and high-priced one at that. But if
a man can’t have a home of his own, the
next best thing is that he should at least
be part proprietor, and he is part
proprietor when the State owns the land.
On the other hand, he isn’t even part pro-
prietor when Macarthur Onslow or
Antill owns it. Pure leasehold—the kind
that the Macarthur Onslows and Antills
give to their tenants—is a misfortune all
the time. Blow leasehold!

The fine old Greenland drama. “In Old
-Donegal, was taken out of its packing case
and aired at Sydney Adelphi, last Saturday,
by Allen Doone,; the eminent Greenland
actor, who is the usual broth—or stew —of a
boy. The play is the soup plate, so to
speak, which contains the broth ; and it is
very nne broth indeed, if you happen to hail
from Greenland, or to be of Greenland stock.
It you come from Peru or Morocco, you may
not be moved to tears by the Greenland senti-
ment; but you will, at least, be interested.
Mr. Doone, garbpd in vivid green velvet,
looks refreshingly cool himself; but he keeps
the fervor of the mostly Greenland audience
simmering on the electric stove of his genius,
and does not switch off until the last curtain
falls. As Larry Donovan (A Happy Boy),
he is possessed of all the virtues, and is so
generous that when he wants to give the
lawyer’s poor boy-clerk a sandwich, he splits
a whole loaf down the centre. Pour sougs,
with a strong* Greenland flavor, help him to
conquer and enslave his audience. Edna
Keeley, as Kate O’Donoghue, is his chief
assistant in these emotional exercises, and
the other members of the co. render loyal and
effective ’Greenland assistance.
NICOLA AT SYDNEY PALACE.
Nicola does a few sleight of handcuff tricks.
Though there were vague rumors that
“The Girl in the Train” was to be shunted
on to another line by the State Govern-
ment, because of Jack Cannot’s libellous
caricature of the Labor member, apparently
the line is blocked. Sydney is getting to be
the sort of place where all a manager has to
do is to dump a musical play down, and
nothing but the condemnation of the build-
ing for old age will move it. Present scribe
is so tired of mentioning that the train is
still stationary at the Criterion, that he in-
vites subscriptions for the purchase of a pint
of dynamite and a bushel of kerosene.

At Ryde, Sydney, there is a home for in-
curables, where the afflicted and heavy laden
spend their last sad days in an atmosphere
of blue air and bright flowers. To help this
deserving charity, Mrs. Boult, who probably
knows -more about dancing than any
other woman in Australia, and is one
of the most earnest students of the
drama, is producing, in conjunction with
the “Sydney Muffs” Dramatic Soci-
ety, her four-act drama, “Maron, the
Ethiopian.” The production takes place at
the Criterion, on Saturday, December 9, at
2.30 p.m. The play is a good one, and Mrs.
Boult shows, in a vigorous way, how the
racial bar between Black and White can
never be satisfactorily got over.
Although Nicola did not prove his right to
call himself the “Prince of Magicians,” at
the Palace (Sydney), on Saturday night, he
proved his ability to keep a packed house in
the best of humor solely by his own abilities,
and in spite of his tame comedian and liis
untamed orchestra. In the circumstance, no
man could do much more, and whole herds
could do very much less. Many of his tricks
are old —the only man who had all new
tricks died long before Simon was getting
most of the limelight in old Samaria —but
all of them were well selected, brought up to

date, and performed with the rapidity and
ease of an oiled Eskimo slithering down a
sand-papered iceberg. Amid a series of
escapes from cabinets and boxes, or dodges
based on the substitution of the original
prisoner for a fresh captive, the best was
that in which Nicola allowed himself to be
locked in a portable cupboard, which was
turned round by a male assistant for good
luck, or something. The cupboard blinds
were then raised by the said assistant, who
completed the trick by snatching away his
wig and gown and bowing his thanks. It
was Nicola himself, but it took the house
some time to grasp the fact. In the second
part of the entertainment, Nadolny took a
hand with some juggling, and Fern and Mack
appeared in hand-balancing and gymnastic
work that requires only to be better dressed
and presented to be one of the best turns of Its
kind seen in Sydney. Nicola will appear at
the Palace, under the direction of J. and N.
Tait, until further notice.

Wilson Hallett, English comedian and
originator of that terrific problem, the cry-
ing baby, is the Tivoli novelty of the week.
The green young nowls of Hallett are amus-
ing or painfully real, according to whether
you are single or double. The amount of
laughter he raises suggests that there are a
lot of people in Sydney who have never been
howled up in the waste hours of the night to
promenade and help diagnose the wants of
an uproarious human who can speak no lan-
guage. The rest of the show is supplied
principally by the Du For Trio (dancers),
J. P. Ling (comedian), Johnson and Dean
(colored rag-timers), Ridiculous Recco (bur-
lesque acrobat), and baritone Ossipoff.
Spencer’s film version of “Sweet Nell of
Old Drury,” now being screened at the Ly-
ceum, is a creditable production which keeps
close enough to the stage version, and runs
in some outdoor extras, wherein the real
scenery gives the play a startling touch of
reality. The approach of Nellie Stewart
down a narrow bush track wrings cheers
from the audience; and when she offers the
house an orange, the welkin suffers the usual
damage. The pursuit of Fairfax, his march
to the prison, Jeffreys’ stealthy advance on
Nell Gwynn’s house, Olivia’s trip to White-
hall in Jeffreys’ chair, and other incidents,
are shown amidst real Sydney surroundings.
At the end, Charles yearningly pursues the
retreating Nell through a fine garden, where
he is met and comforted by a page, who
brings him two spaniels.

whoever gets the Royal now has a monopoly
in drama, and to build the other house would
mean keen competition. Among the picture
people, competition could hardly be keener
than it is. The Wests have enlarged their
hall, and intend to build a second alongside
the Kundle-street Arcade, where they pro-
pose to run an all-day show; Wondergraph
means to have a home of its own next year,
exactly opposite the Royal; and the Empire
sits solid on its central, if unfashionable,
position. Meanwhile, the numerous amateur
dramatic shows have to depend on one or
other of the well-appointed suburban halls.
Adelaide Royal has had a week of that
joyous old story, “Under Two Flags,” a
Ouidaesque version of “The Squaw Man” ;
but the weather for indoor shows has been
infernal. The house has now taken a sud-
den spring into a lighter form of entertain-
ment, with Blascheck and Miss Wrighton.
Mostly, the same clever people are at the
■ l u , s week as were there last week,
with Clark and Hamilton leading. West’s
pictures are dramatic, with Miss Duggan’s
Glory Quayle in “The Christian” ; and the
Empire has a film-play that skilfully intro-
duces a four-round boxing match. Else-
where, there is a rush for the open air. The
Dandies, clean and clever, are immensely
popular on the Exhibition terraces; the
Kings, with Mrs. Slapoffski singing, and
two clever young French Totos acrobating,
has transferred itself bodily to the Adelaide
Oval; and Wondergraph has moved into a
summer pitch on North Terrace. This last
move releases the Town Hall, to the great
joy ot the musical societies and other pro-
moters of high-class concerts.

, 0n Saturday night, the Melba Grand Opera
Go. was seen, at tier Majesty’s (Melbourne),
in a production of “Othello”; the music of
which is by G. Verdi, while the libretto is
attributed to W. Shakspeare and A. Boito
In this work we are introduced to Verdi in
his old age (he was 75 when he produced it),
and trying to be WAgneresque. For the most
part, it is not an excessively interesting old
age. or a brilliantly successful imitation of
Wagner. Certainly the second act of the
dpera is lifted to a lofty musical altitude in
the scene between the nigger and lago, when
the latter is suggesting that Mrs. Othello is
no better than she ought to be. This scene is
splendidly handled by Zeni, whose perform-
ance of the Moorish person is equal to any-
thing he has done during the season, and
beandiani, whose lago is so good that it
enters into competition with his Scarpia.
Scandiani knows his business thoroughly,
and his habit of refusing to provide a critic
with a peg upon which he can hang a few
well-chosen animadversions makes the said
critic tired. Quesnel, also, fatigues the pre-
sent commentator, but for very different rea-
sons ; his Cassio provides no adequate justifi-
cation for the coon’s jealousy.
Melba, as the misguided damsel who leaves
the parental fireside and flies to the sooty
bosom of the African, _ manages to look the
part, and. of course, sings it perfectly. The
end of the co.’s Melbourne season is now
pD'nly discernible, without the aid of a
telescope- Last night (Wednesday), “Aida”
was due to transpire; to-night will be de-
void to the rejuvenation of “Faust”; to-
morrow night Delila will make eyes at Sam-
son for the last time, and on Saturday after-
noon the season will be brought to a close
with a mixed pi-ogramme, the only new fea-
ture of which will be a performance of the
fourth act of “II Trovatore.” “Miss Gibbs”
is due back at Her Majesty’s on Saturday
night, and proposes to remain there for one
calendar week.
A DREAM
OF GRAND
OPERA,
AT HER
MAJESTY'S,
MELBOURNE.
THE BEAU-
TIFUL CON-
SUMPTIVE
HEROINE.
Served up in the Evening Bloodstain,
with a ground plan of the Sparafucile hostel
and an X to mark the place where Gilda was
stabbed, the story of “Rigoletto” should be
worth a special edition. Anyway, the
promise of gore, and of Melba singing “Caro
Aome,” attracted an audience which squeezed
itself into every available inch of space at
Her Majesty’s, on November 29. There is
little in Verdi’s musical melodrama to call
for critical enthusiasm, but it provides Melba
with several opportunities to show her voice
at its best. It was as Gilda that she made
her first appearance beside the Thames, and
her trill at the end of the “Caro Nome’ ana
made her famous right away. Her render-
ing of this gorgeous piece of vocalism makes
the finest effort of the mere nightingale seem
like a cheap phonographic reproduction of
Alexander Peacock’s laugh. Taken all
round, Gilda must be regarded as one of
Melba’s best performances. Rigoletto is in
the hands of liossi, who is stronger histrioni-
cally than he is vocally, and who, in the
matter of “make-up,” represents the unpopu-
lar humorist as a compromise between Shy-
lock and Uncle Sam. John McCormack makes
a melodious Duke, and, of course, wins a howl
of popular appreciation for his singing of
“La Donna e Mobile,” the somewhat trivial
ditty anent the fickleness of lovely woman.
At the same time, McCormack does not im-
press one as a very dangerous libertine; in
fact, his Duke seems so morally reliable
that this paper would have no scruples about
introducing its best girl to him. Kaufmann
is fairly satisfactory as the professional
assassin, Sparafucile, and Voluntas-Ranzen-
berg is fairly unsatisfactory as his sister,
Maddalena.
THE HERO
SINGS OF
LOVE AND
STARS AND
DAISIES AND
BUTTERCUPS.
-Lhe lachrymose story of ‘‘Camille,” with
Miss Duggan as the heroine, was unwound
at the King’s, on Saturday night. Camille
combines the practice of Mrs. Warren’s pro-
fession with preaching which would do
credit to a Methodist Sunday-school marm.
She coughs intermittently as she skips down
the broad path that leadeth to consumption;
pursued by Roy Redgrave, in a velvet coat
and a necktie suggestive of garlic, absinthe
and the rest of the seven deadly-dull vices of
Bohemia. The leading male character is no
less uninteresting than the female. He at
first impresses one as a picturesque sinner,
but quickly develops Primitive Methodist
tendencies, and talks like the noblest Wor-
rall of them all. The present season of sor-
row is to last for six nights only, and on
Saturday night the French Flossie will be
replaced by “The Female Swindler.”
At the Opera House, Bert Levy is still
shining like a good deed in a dark world, but
he is soon to shine elsewhere. Other per-
formers whose nights are numbered are
George the First, the monkey with a pen-
chant for the vices of frail humanity; Dave
Samuels, whom the programme insists upon
as a Hebrew comedian; and Sam Mayo, who
is also described as a comedian, but whom
this commentator regards as a tragic mistake.
The Kasracs, who are nearly half a circus in
themselves, and Zelini, whose particular vice
is comic juggling, show no signs of depart-
ing, and a further air or permanence is given
to the programme by the presence of the
First Part.

“Plis Majesty’s Guests,” the formless, in-
definite show, which is about the size of a
piece of timber, the color of a motor-car and
the shape of a jim-jam, will depart from the
Princess’s quietly and unostentatiously after
Friday night. On Saturday, “Under Two
Flags” is to happen, and the beauteous Bertie
and the sporty Cigarette will make a mess of
their lives to the complete satisfaction of all
concerned.

At the Theatre Royal, “Dame Nature” is
failing to win as large a share of popular
approval as “Lady Frederick” did. Both on
the stage and in real life, Lolette, the little
bundle of natural emotions, is less charming
than Lady Fred, the corsetful of artifice.
Also, Stephen Ewart makes Robert Ber-
tram, a fairly natural man, k less real figure
than his Paradine Fouldes, the more or less
impossible superman. The Bohemian first
act is the best part of the play, and the
two chief characters seem delightful, viewed
through a thick haze of cigarette smoke. In
Bohemia Lolette is in her element. The
little model is hardly a model wife for the
aspiring Bertram. Anyway, contact with
the Best People rubs most of the gilt off
both of them, exposing the snobbishness of
one and the commonness of the other, and the
audience is left to make the best of its dis-
illusionment.

The Prahran Lyric (Vic.) now regularly
feeds the spectator on photo-plays of Dago
operas. Last week “Aida” crossed the screen
in 33 scenes ; this week “I Pagliacci” takes
a run ; and probably next week “La Boh&me”
will depict Murger’s gallery of irresponsibles.
In the way of educative stuff, the Lyric fre-
quently bores its public with capital studies
of modern industries. Last Saturday an ex-
cellent item showed the making of a book in
one of Britain’s largest publishing houses.
After scanning the bill at West’s, Mel-
bourne, on Saturday, this paper regarded
“Dan the Dandy,” as the brightest item.
Dan is a sartorial insurrection off the latest
mode, and bustles the audience into laughter
by the mild, well-meaning madness of his ways.
Another good humorous film was “Intrepid
Davy,” which depicted a salt’s adventures
among harem ladies, varying greatly in
charm and avoirdupois. A tearful subject
was “Then You’ll Remember Me,” and a
curious picture showed the religious habits
of the Persians, who ought to get the tired
back through their peculiar methods of
adoration.
AT POVERTY POINT.
In Melbourne, Bert Levy, the Australian sketch
artist, has come in for a good deal of attention from
the Man Who Knows All About It and the Bloke
Who Has Seen the Same Sort of Thing Before. His
turn, they allege, is a. fake. His pictures are already
printed on the glass slide on which he pretends to
draw them. The slide is covered with a black
composition, and all the artist has to do is to
scrape the stuff off, and the picture eventuates. Bert
recently invited The Bulletin to a private perform-
ance in his room at Menzies’ Hotel. The present
scribe minutely examined everything the artist uses
in connection with his turn, and then leant over
Bert’s shoulder and watched him draw redskins, girls
etc., precisely as he does behind the footlights. The
jobs were well and truly done; the redskin looked
fierce and proud, the girl was a comely wench, and
the other things were admirable. This writer wishes
to state, in a firm tone, that the allegations of the
knowledgable folk are, to put it as courteously as
possible, the bray of Dogberry and the voice of
B&rtolihe Saddletree crying in the wilderness.
Two days after this Bulletin blossoms on the
bookstalls, a number of abbreviated people will be
on view in Wirths’ Park, Melbourne. The fact that
they avoid being short of money by being short of
inches, shows that the carrying round of surplus fat
and bone is a foolish proceeding. Many people have
paid money to look kindly on them and shake them
by the hand, simply because they are abridged edi-
tions of, the human family. This must in a great
measure compensate the midgets for being born into
a world where everything is four sizes too large for
them, and where no barman will halve a long beer
If all their inhabitants were the same size as the
people of Tiny Town, Melbourne and Sydney could
easily i. o,d a million apiece, without hollering for
help. These are the days when the two blown-out
Australian capitals threaten to split down the seams
through overcrowding, and worried commissions dance
round trying to unlace them before the tragedy
happens. The abridged human, who takes small
sizes in everything, from houses to socks, looks like
a possible way out of the difficulty. Therefore, let
us consider him earnestly.
~ T *J e soft-eyed, cooing Maggie Papakura, who was
the boss of the rather disastrous Maori excursion to
Britain, is said to have got herself engaged to “a
country gentleman” of those parts, and probably
will not return. So the catastrophe may turn out all
right for Maggie, at least. The tour was really the
joint spec, of the lady and the mostly-Sydney syndi-
cate that found the money; Maggie’s part was to
find the people. Things started to go wrong with the
venture almost from the jump. The “village” moved
itself to Sydney, and struck that city’s wettest period
for years, and the rain soaked a few thousands out
of the syndicate’s little bundle. Then it made a bad
mistake it got the offer of a London engagement

production Royd, who is a native of Melbourne, was
M n o vhi ed A d °iT n /! nd robbed b y a gang, close to the
Marble Arch. On recovering consciousness, he found
himself short of a gold watch and chain, a diamond
ling and other bullion. “Bushrangers!” says the
most disgusted party. “You have to come to civi-
lised London to find ’em!”
.“®- . de ,, D -’’i Bert Levy has been told so often
about it that he now sees no humor in the Argus
notice of the Opera House, which said: “The second
part of the programme comprises items by Mr. Bert
Levy, the highly-trained chimpanzee, Mr. Dave
Samuels,” and so on.
Carmine : Exit John Gordon. The best praise
that can be given him as a craftsman is that his
work could not be distinguished from that of his
eminent father George, whose father also was a scene-
painter. Father George it was who painted the
lamous scenery for the Bancrofts’ “Merchant of
Venice.” He was a peculiarly modest man, but very
fruitful in ideas in every theatrical branch, and no
wonder Williamson missed him greatly. He invented
those splendid tableaux which so “lifted” the play
of “The Royal Divorce.” Mrs. George Gordon was a
well-remembered actress in Sydney and Melbourne.
Her husband came to Australia with Garner’s
comedy company, which included Blanche Stammers
and her mother, Clara Lemore, Freddy Marshall,
Warde, and one Roberts. The other Robertses have
included Dick and his popular son H.R., Reginald,
and little Roberts with the “New Boy” company.
Then there was Gilbert Roberts, a bold junior re-
porter, who took the Melb. Haymarket, and engaged
Montgomery.
“L.H.P.”: George Sutton Titheradge has played
over 1000 roles in his time. One of the few big
parts that he has never tackled is “Richelieu,” in
Lytton’s play of that name—a matter of chronic
regret with him. His career dates from before 1877,
when he appeared at the London Court Theatre under
Hare. It was in 1866 that he actually first “made
up” as a pro., the theatre being the Portsmouth
Royal. For 10 years he studied his biz in the pro-
vinces. He was Barnardo to Charles Kean’s Hamlet,
among other things, and got Rob Roy as his first
big part. Burlesque and panto, (with Tith. as the
dame) were included in this era. He claims that he
has spoken to more people in the mass than any
other actor. The figure is 200,000, and the event took
place in India in 1877, when Titheradge, as Herald,
proclaimed Victoria Empress of that nigger-infested
spot.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” : The freehold of the Prin-
cess’s Theatre, Melbourne, has been sold to George
Marlow for £38,000. The site was originally offered
for sale on April 11, 1839, and was considered so
valueless that not a single bid could be got for it.
In 1856 it was worth £l5O per foot. In the first
’so’s a wooden structure was erected on the site by
the late G. B. W. Lewis, who named it the Amphi-
theatre. Later on it was Astley’s Amphitheatre. In
the late ’so’s it was converted into the Princess’s
Theatre, with George Fawcett as lessee and manager
—he subsequently added the family name, Rowe.
This “tinder box” flourished, and on its stage many
eniinent actors appeared. I saw Mary Provost there ;
likewise G. V. Brooke, Joseph Jefferson, Wheatleigh
(who first brought us the “Colleen Bawn,” and played
Danny Mann therein), Marie Duret, Clarence Holt,
William Hoskins and a host of others. It was on
that stage, too, that Fawcett produced his adapta-
tions of Dickens’s novels, “Barnaby Rudge” and
“David Copperfield,” and here he produced the bur-
lesque in which he appeared as the eccentric Dr.
Hunter. But I never sat in the “old wooden match-
box,” in the late ’so’s, without a fear of fire; had
one broken out, there would have been a holocaust.
The present theatre is, in that respect, most of the
things that the old one wasn’t.
The “Australian Nights” (December 13 and 14), at
Melbourne Repertory Theatre, will offer a variety of
playlets to competitive examination. There are four
on the programme, and each of them will last half
an hour or more. Louis Esson’s “Dead Timber” has
five characters —a selector and his family. Blamire
Young’s contribution is an extravaganza with a
moral. Alfred Buchanan (of the Age) has com-
mitted himself to “The Sacred Flame,” which intro-
duces five characters, including a burglar, who is
expected to mix sentiment with his felony. And
William Moore produces a revised version of the
serious comedietta, “The Only Game,” in which he
took the floor some two years ago. Edward Dyson
was understood to have a playlet in hand, but he
is not letting it go this season, anyhow.
Recently, the Dunedin (M.L.) musicians, etc., who
play joyously before the curtain goes up, and in
between acts (often, no doubt, as a sort of recom-
pense for the rest of the show) appeared before the
Arbitration Court with a list of urgent require-
ments. This is what they got: (1) Minimum wage
of £3 per week of six nights, one matinee and two
rehearsals, not exceeding two hours each; (2) all
time beyond two hours for any rehearsal and all
extra rehearsals to be paid for at the rate of 2s. 6d.
per hour; (3) casual performers to receive 12s. 6d.
for each performance; (4) where more than one
matin<ie is given in a week, 10s. extra for each is
to be paid after the first; (5) preference to union-
ists. The award came into force on November 27,
and is booked for a season of two years.
“Stargazer”: What is chiefly the matter with
“Dame Nature,” done from the French by Frederick
Fenn for Ethel Irving, is a determined and ruthless
piling-up of the sentimental horrors to smother the
heroine in misery and tears. Every device known to
the Family Herald novelists to induce kitchen
maids to welter in briny sympathy over the pro-
longed sufferings of Lady Ermyntrude, is adopted to
aggravate the agony in the case of Lolette. And,
after all the woe, it is found that her husband has not
taken to the Princess, but merely to drink, and is
just sitting round, consoling himself with whisky,
till such time as the missus may call him to heel,
or to the fatted calf. An extremely clever bad play,
bristling with points like a porcupine, but just as
uneven as that prickly insect, and with an ending
so weak that it may reasonably be regarded as a
collapse.
A REALLY PERMANENT ENGAGEMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OPERA HOUSE. WANTED, SIX TALL, GOOD
LOOKING LADIES for FIRST PART; dancers pre-
ferred ; permanent engagement if suitable.— Advt.
In pagan temples when the world was young
Priestesses danced till they were old and sere;
The worshipper bowed down and held his tongue
While round the floor the aged dancers flung,
And grew more bony with each fleeting year.
Behind the pillars—in the market-place,
The worshipper denounced the holy show
With bated breath and white, averted face;
Yet daily to the temple he would pace;
For he was bound by policy to go.
The temples now are level with the plain;
The old priestesses long ago are dust;
But in their stead, for daily bread and gain,
New devotees, while long years wax and wane,
Prance on the surface of the old Earth’s crust.
Men come and go; the old Earth slows and cools ;
Stars dive across the sky wherein they shone;
Silence engulfs Life’s string of passing fools,
And Progress scraps all chestnuts, creeds and rules.
Only the First Part goes for ever on!

“Vic.” on patriarchal pumps:—
T , 1 ~ L . ~ n
I wrote, some time ago .that the Crown Hotel,
Queen-street, was the oldest in Melbourne. An an-
tiquanan waylays me with the information that the
Adam and Eve, in Little Collms-street, and the Yarra
in Flinders-street are older. Yes; but these are
comparatively modern buildings whiß the Crown

“ Edward! You dare embrace that creature
again and I leave you!"
Hot weather note from the Oldest In-
habitant :
Three ancient pubberies in Little Flinders-street,
Melbourne,. put up the shutters for good this Christ-
mas. The Apollo, on the S.W. corner of the Lane
and Russell-street, has the year 1847 on its frontis-
piece. In the “roaring days” it was kept by a Mr.
Ollis. It was the only house in that locality in that
day. A few days later, the Hen and Chickens, on
the corner of Hosier-lane, was opened. It was de-
stroyed by fire some 10 years ago, and when re-
opened became the Warehouseman’s Club. The
Windsor Castle was originally known as the Galatea,
and stands on the corner of La Trobe Parade ; while
the Flinders is on the corner of Stephen-street. Under
the Victorian law the owners obtain compensation.
The Apollo, Hen and Chickens, Windsor
Castle and Flinders —that sounds like four.
Still, in this weather, the practice of count-
ing four drinks as three deserves to be en-
couraged.
There is such a crowd of imported gov-
ernors now, that the eye of the public gets
footsore dodging the vice-regal paragraphs in
the dailies. Likewise, the summit of the
“Personal” column is so scarred with the
fatal Ex. where the function occurred, that it
resembles the photo of a street where six
tragedies happened. It would be difficult to
find a crowd nowadays that wouldn’t yield at
least one governor if put through a fine
sieve. This roving mob of governors com-
plicates the congestion problem, and helps to
overcrowd public entertainments. But there
are times when his Ex. must yearn to be just
a plain, paying member of the public, and
have the great privilege of crying aloud that
the show is rotten, and trampling over the
feet of those that sit between him and the
door. The Royal Life Saving Society gave
a free public demonstration of life-saving, at
the Melbourne City Baths, on Wednesday
week. Several thousands of the free public
surged into the place, and filled it so tight
that proper ventilation was suspended.
Cheerful city “rats” darted and wriggled in
the crush, and the husky whoops of stray
drunks cleaved like rockets through the
thick, still atmosphere. The show consisted
of long, sweltering intervals, punctuated with
short, splashy events, after each of which the
dripping contestants had to fight their way
through the crush and foul air. In the midst
of it all, the suffering G.-G. and his party
perspired and gasped. Free citizens, whose
daily jobs were done, fought their ways to
the exits when they could stand no more,
speaking their minds freely as they went.
But his Ex. hung on silently and endured.
He probably wished that someone would come
and rip off the roof with ropes and elephants ;
but he just remained and looked miserably
pleased and interested. With the course of
training a governor gets, a man might look
pleased and interested at an Armenian mas-
sacre.
“Starboard Light” on an international
matter: —
The weirdest tale sprung on the Australian public
for a large and dusty space of time, came from Suva
(Fiji), where the rich uncles grow, during the re-
cent strained relationships between Britain and
Kaiser land. According to the yarn, which was pub-
lished in the papers under II. G. Wells’s Mr.
Potts would have described as “gustiferous” head-
lines, the captain of the German warship Cormoran,
which had just foamed into Suva harbor, applied to
the skipper of the British marine battery Prometheus
for leave to despatch a message' by cable to the Gov-
ernment at Berlin. The request was haughtily re-
fused, and the German given five minutes to leave the
harbor, which he promptly did in accordance with
the best Drury Lane traditions. The press message
was, of course, scoffed at by everybody excepting th.e
small tin Jingo, and he refused to be convinced
until the other day, when the Prometheus reached
Cairns. There, the British mariner, on being ques-
tioned about the matter, explained that the occur-
rence had been slightly exaggerated, inasmuch as
(1) he had not ordered the Cormoran to leave the
harbor; (2) the German skipper, in common with
everybody else, was fully aware that the cable office
like the thripenny beer office, was open to all comers;
(3) the first he had heard of . the incident was at
Cairns ; (4) he didn’t place milch reliance On it.
“Melb”: Victoria’s suffiExcellency Fuller
has just been on a kind of State visit to
Williamstown—the first time a Governor
has been there since
Bourke’s day. Bourke
called this place after the
King, while Melbourne,
supposed to be less im-
portant, was named after
a mere Premier-—pro-
phetic perhaps of the
waning of monarchs and
the waxing of Ministers.
Melbourne was laid out
before the news of Vic-
toria’s accession; con-
sequently nothing in the
original square mile was
named after her. Tak-
ing Melbourne streets
from the west, they ran
- —“King,” “William,”
“Queen,” “Adelaide,” the
last named after Wil-
liam’s queen; but they
changed it to Elizabeth,
not after Queen Elizabeth,
but after Bourke’s wife.
“B. Button”: It appears that the crimp-
ing, for which several Australian ports have
long been notorious, is not dead, as some
people thought; in fact, has hardly been sleep-
ing. A deputation which recently interviewed
Premier McGowen, pointed out that one in-
dustrious crimp in Newcastle has been so
successful in the game of providing men to
masters about to sail —at a price and no
questions asked—that he has built up a big-
bank account on the proceeds. Undue leni-
ency is, of course, the chief answer to the
affair. A law that hands the crimper a deli-
cate and lady-like fine for his misdeeds isn't
worth a broken biscuit. A long term with-
out the option would be better—though, to
produce the very best results, every
crimp, on conviction, should be con-
demned to ship before the mast for a voy-
age, round the Horn, on a hungry hell-ship,
with a hardcase, hazing, Yankee skipper and
a bullying, Bluenose, bucko mate.
RUBBING IT IN.
THE ALDERMAN (before the municipal banquet): “ Hello , Brown! I never realised before
that you temperance men have your uses, a ler all. There's no cloak-room attend-
ant to-night. Would you mind remembering the number of my hatpeg for me!"
From the Oldest Inhabitant: —
Ultimo House, over whose resumption value
Horsehair, Costs and Co* are having a good time in
Sydney, is one of the oldest houses now standing in
the State. It was built 6n the large gfiant, known
as Ultimo, by Surgeon John Harris, of The old Rum
Corps, in the ’2o’s. It is supposed to have got its
name from a slip of the pen, or a bit of ignorance
on the part of an official. The doctor was summoned
to attend a court on a certain day, the official using
the word “ultimo” instead of “proximo,” and he
went on chuckling over the joke for years and years.
The doctor found the house too large and too lonely
for his very limited family, and removed to Shane’s
Park, another property of his near St. Mary’s. The
big house had, as an early tenant, John Edye Man-
ning, father of Justice William Manning, the father
at that time being Registrar of the Supreme Court.
He built the big house in Bent-street, Sydney, which
subsequently became the Pultenay Hotel, and later
on the Australian Club House; the site is now occu-
pied by Dalgety’s offices. Ultimo House was men-
tioned by the boy Brace, who was concerned with
Wilson and Tattersdale in the murder of Dr. Wardell,
the early-day barrister, at Petersham. Giving evi-
dence against the pair, Brace said that, while look-
ing for a ship to take them from the country, they
hovered “round Ultimo House,” the place being then
dense bush. The old house had many occupants
before it came into the possession of George Harris
—one of the brothers of Matthew Harris —whose
widow is now the claimant. The Government wants
it for technical education purposes, and offered
£33,550. Mrs. Harris, now an old lady, claimed
£96,000. There have been previous tough fights
over resumptions on the same estate. Thirty years
ago the Government resumed portions at Darling
Harbor for railway purposes. One of the claimants
was “old John” Harris, of Shane’s Park, who wanted
£117,382 for four acres and seven perches. He got
£30,000. Miss May Harris, for two acres and 26
perches wanted £21,912, and the jury gave her
£5125; W. H. Harris, for one acre one rood and 16
perches wanted £21,381, and got £6OOO. James
Martin was the Judge who determined those claims.

The present most virulent complaint
against Jervis Bay as a site for the Naval
College, as voiced by the Sydney Tory press,
is “the absence of all social amenities.”
“Social amenities,” when translated into
plain English, mean theatres, picture-shows,
dances, barmaids, drinks, cigarettes, bil-
liards and such-like. It is a pity that these
same papers don’t consider the case of the
students at the N.S.W. agricultural farm
near Bowen, who. are also cut off from social
amenities, and arrange for removing the
State training farm to Paddington. As a
matter of hard, dreary fact, there are lots
of occupations—agricultural, pastoral, mili-
tary, naval and other —in which people have
to learn to do without social amenities a
good part of the time. When the naval
cadets grow up and go to sea, they will find
no ballet or op*a or picture gallery on board
Yie Australian ironclad, and they must just
n . donrivaHrm Hi a the
put up with the deprivation. It is me samt
with soldiers on active service, sheep and
cattle men in the West, sugar growers in the
North, cow-raisers on the Richmond River,
merchant seamen, engineers who are build-
j transcontinental railways, and many
i...,
Others._ I erhaps it la best that young men
who aim at leading the strenuous life in
these occupations should learn early to do
without barmaids and cigarette shops and
Government House dances. If Christopher

From “'The Passing of the Idle Rich,” by
Frederick T. Martin:
The little beast lives in a private room, and is con-
stantly attended by a valet. It rides abroad behind
its private trotter, has its own outfit of clothes, its
dining table, and a bed made Of solid ivory, tooned
with gold ornaments. All told, perhaps, a dozen
hpman beings minister to the comfort of the little
simian, and the mistress cheerfully pays from ten
to yj fteen : thousand dollars yearly on this one ex-
travagance. She became dissatisfied with the dining
service in the monkey-rooin of her home, and he!

THE PASSING OP THE HORSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Wednesday next will be a solemn day in the his-
tory of urban locomotion, for the London General
Omnibus Company will then withdraw the last of its
horsed ’buses- from the streets of London. In such
matters, where the capital leads the provinces fol-
low, and within a short time we may expect the final
disappearance from our streets of the horse-drawn
omnibus. —London paper.
1 hear the “honk” of passing cars,
The scrape of many feet,
While potent petrol to the stars
Proclaims a horseless street ;
The large lights burn, the swift wheels turn,
A thousand engines beat,
And neat and far the horseless car
Ts master of the street.
Closed is the silent stable door,
The groom has passed away ;
The cabby fierce shall threat no more
The drinky wight to slay;
For earth and air the traffic share
That rolls by night and day,
While trotting feet to sausage meat
Are turned to make them pay.
Somewhere above the lifting mist
A monoplane goes by,
With ’Arriet waiting to be kist
By ’Arry in the sky ;
The large wings sweep the cloudy deep,
And as the pigeons fly,
Men take the trip, sans hoof or whip,
Straight home across the sky.
And how shall Pegasus ascend
To find his rhythmic home?
Shall young Apollo music lend
To aid a whirring gnome?
All flesh is grass ! Horse poets pass,
And poets’ horses roam,
Grown sad and wise, up songless skies
That bear the flying gnome.

“Don Q.”: A recent issue of the Elec-
tric Times, published in the country where
the curse of Cobden roosts, put it this way
when reviewing the strike epidemic in Glas-
gow, Leeds, and other cities :
We can sympathise to some extent with the de-
mands of the carters for shorter hours and better
pay, but not so in the case of the tramway em-
ployees. These latter belong to the class ot pam-
pered civil servants.
Then I turned over the page and glued my
bright eye upon the following paragiapli
The Wages Board (Tramway) has given the fol-
lowing award: — . ,
Motormen and inspectors—Beginning at b<. per
hour, rising (after two years’ service) to id. per
Conductors —4£d. to 6d. per hour, week of 00
hours ; overtime, time and a quarter.
Now, if these men. were not pampered, what
wages would they get? * #
Commerce is probably the real original
Beast of Revelation, and a hungry and cir-
cuitous beast at that. As a case in point, a
house-agent told the Sydney High Rents
Commission that he was haunted by a turni-
ture dealer, who wanted to rent temporarily
every empty house on his list, and was will-
ing to fee the agent handsomely to that end.
His idea was to rush a lot of his old furni-
ture into the premises, and then take advan-
tage of the house-famine to stipulate that the
incoming tenant must buy the sticks, whe-
ther he wanted them or not. It is only the
commercial man who gets bright ideas like
tha.t. It never strikes the artist (say) to
rent a lot of small houses and. sub-let them
to distracted people on condition they buy
his nefarious oil-paintings at an absurd price.
And the churches haven’t dropped to the
idea yet, but they may. A Baptist Church,
which owned two adjacent streets ot small
houses all let to devout Baptists should be
on a good wicket.

After all, “the Holy Ghost and Us” has
not been drowned. That sect, which went
to and fro on the face of the waters looking
for the Promised Land, just as Lane’s foolish
crowd once did in Paraguay, propelled its
crazy vessel into Sydney and Melbourne some
time ago, but decided that Australia lacked
the requisite elements of holiness. So it put
a fresh straw in its hair, and passed on. It
was heard of begging food from passing ships
all over the seas, and then the floating men-

Curdie’s Itiver, a stream which, on most
days, ripples -respectfully through Victoria s
squatter-haunted western District, has not
been well lately. Last week-end, all the
water became white and frothy, and a con-
siderable numbir of fish died. Also, the
troubled stream wore a peculiar smell, and
the local cow refused to drink of its waters.
The cause is supposed to be a volcanic dis-
turbance in the lake near Mount Leura,
which heap various people have noticed has
been getting hotter of late. The stony bosom
of the old mud fountain is used for roadinak-
ing purposes; and the deeper the excavations
go, the warmer the scoria becomes. Perhaps
the Devil has made up his mind to settle the
Western District for good, and has driven a
gang of spike-tailed firemen into old Leura s
engine-room to get up steam. Leura is gen-
erally supposed to be extinct, but it seems to
have more energy and road-making material
in it than Premier Weary, who was going to
furbish up every bush track before the elec-
tions, and make Gippsland a network of bou-
levards. Weary looks so extinct, nowadays
that anxious supporters keep looking at him
through field-glasses to see if he is still
smoking. . * *
The man who has to travel from Parra-
matta to Sydney by train meets several
morals on the road. First of dll the Necro-
oolis, that suburb of the dead,
reminds him of the inevitable
end ; and then the way the train
bangs and bumps over the ad-
jacent points makes him think
thkt the end is about to come
suddenly. Necropolis station
badly requires to have its points
relaid. The mind wilts before
this reminder, and just when
the lowest point has been
reached the train bumps and
bangs and rocks into Fleming-
ton, where the cattle that are
sentenced to death arrive for
sale. Flemington brings to even
the most dispirited some meas-
ure of comfort, and the_ soul or
man rejoices within him that
the Power which runs the show
did not so order events that he
should walk the earth on four
legs and eat grass. No railway
travelling is comfortable in
N.S.W., especially to a person
who suffers with rheumatism:
hut when an interminable line
of trucks crawls ! down a siding,
revealing sheep dead of thirst,
overcrowding and general wear-
iness, and trodden flat, he real-
ises that there are worse things
than having to perish quietly
in bed. It must be a terrible
thing to die and be trodden on
while the mind is taken up with
the intricacies and details ot
shedding the mortal coil. /This
method of bringing practically
the whole of the meat supply
of the metropolis to one small
roadside station is honnble, and
should be done away with.
Cattle and sheep which have
endured the horrors of a long
railway journey, in a warm
climate, are unfit or >
and there are no facilities at Flemington for
getting them fit. Its “well-watered grass
paddocks” are a lie and a fraud. The grass
is missing, and half the time the watei i»
just as absent as the grass. #
Maoriland has discovered its record fern-
inine freak in a young woman who recently
seized an opportunity to escape from tne
fever ward of one of the hospitals. As soon
as she was missed, John Dunns, as well as
a number of; intelligent citizens, scoured
the surrounding country without success,
for the reason that the young person, not
wishing to be found by the police, ha,d re-
mained in the most conspicuous street. Be-
ing eventually collected there, she explained
that she was looking for her best boy, in
order to infect him, and thereby be the means
of introducing him at the hospital. Things
were lonely in the hospital, she said, and
time hung heavily, like a large cat on tne
back' fence. At time of writing, the best
boy’s opinion of the proposed hospital lioney-
moon had not been made public.
“Blcggs” : From Melbourne Punch: —
We have grown accustomed to seeing our. guber-
natorial people—in state — at every theatrical per-
formance of note. We have learnt to accept as a
recognised thing that they should deign to mix witii
the common herd at a ball, and not segregate them-
selves, as used to be the custom in the past. • We
have taken their riding to hounds as a matter of
course. And they have done that. The polo team
was a novelty, but, after all, it was an expected
novelty. The enthusiasm for races, for cricket, the
absolute übiquity of the Government House parties—
all astonished and pleased us. But the great sur-
prise of - illl was carefully kept in reserve. It was
the spectacle of her Excellency Lady Denman and
Mr. Vernon, the Private Secretary, cheerfully and
light-heartedly playing tennis in the mixed doubles
handicap.
In the natural emotionalism of a supreme
moment, the grand old paper’s representative
omitted to mention that, as Lady Denman
waved her racquet aloft for the first time
(looking, the while, practically the same os
any other human being), two of the com-
mitteemen fell prone to earth, and there and
then flung a series of violent fits, as some
slight proof of the loyal sentiments engen-
dered in them by her Excellency’s condescen-
sion. Also, whole herds of females wept
hysterically all over the shilling seats ; and a
groundsman became insane and threw hand-
springs at the back of the stand—some of
which hit the edifice with great force; and
an aged resident of Brunswick (he 1 was born
in Peebles, N. 8., and his grandfather had
the honor of being run over by a chariot
driven by the Regent—who was drunk at
the time —on the Brigliton-road in 1819),
arose and sang the National Anthem imme-
diately the vice-regal pair won their first
rally. These events added considerably to
the grandeur of what may be termed a truly
Empire-w r elding scene, and it is strange that
a paper which aspires to a reputation for
sturdy British loyalty should have over-
looked them.
First signs of summer from a paper in the
Very Far North :
Owing to the unpremeditated drunkenness of one
of our staff, we are compelled this week to hold over
several news items, and to cut down and to condense
others.
It recalls the time when Thaddy O’Kane, of
the Towers, remarked that, owing to the
weather, the paper would this week be
edited by the Scissors.
The P.M. who understudies sick James
Gordon’s part at the Adelaide police court
has eclipsed all records for the “legal tech-
nicalities” that make the plain man call the

having left his machine standing in King
William-street, the city’s principal and cen-
tral roadway. Villeneuve Smith, for the de-
fence, suggested that the case was not proved.
The Court thought it was. He suggested,,
then, that the by-law was ultra vires. The
Court thought it wasn’t. Finally, counsel
solemnly argued that the police had not
proved that King William-street is in Adel-
aide. The P.M. declined to admit that this
was a matter of “common knowledge,” and
on that solemn foolishness the case was dis-
missed.

Some men never know when it’s their turn
to keep quiet, and that explains why old
Henry Gyles Turner, the other day, let him-
self loose as an authority on safe banking
and as a hostile critic of the Commonwealth
proposals. Henry Gyles Turner, the man
who knows just what should be done, was
the general manager of the Commercial Bank
of Australia —the great, sprawling institu 7
tion which built itself a palace in Collins-
street, and had hardly opened it before a con-
temptuous small boy scrawled on the closed
front-door the one true word, “Bung!” The
old shareholders, after being bled and bled
and, bled, lost practically everything, and.
though that is 18 years ago, they haven't had
a dividend since; the creditors were cajoled
or compelled to take shares in part-payment,
of a huge debt which Henry Gyles Turner's
bank couldn’t pay otherwise; and' the case
was so awful that even to this day those
shares are worth only about 10s. in the f.
As against the appalling blindness of the
banker, there was the wisdom of John Han-
cock, among the first of Vic.'s Labor mem-
bers, who drew upon himself the howls of
the Assembly by telling Henry Gyles Turner
exactly what was going to happen to the,
Poom and the banks that were floating on
the froth of it.

“Piston Ring” supplies some arguments in

The engineers in most ships are worked night and day.
During my time as third engineer I had charge of
the 12 to four watch. When I finished at 4 a.m. I
turned in till 7.45 a.m., and had to be in the engine-
room at 8 a.m., to relieve the chief for breakfast,
which usually took him three-quarters of an hour
(thirds take a quarter). Breakfast over, I repaired
winches on deck till 12 (noon), when I ducked below
for another four hours. Also, I had two hours to
myself after that, but they were mostly occupied in
cleaning the grease off my weary carcase. At 6 p.m.
I again drifted below, to allow the second engineer
to have his dinner. I generally got into my bunk
at about 8 p.m., and if I was lucky I got to sleep at
9 ; but was called for more toil at 11.45 p.m., feel-
ing more like an Oxford-street ’bus horse than one
fit to shoulder the responsibilities of a freight of
human lives and valuable cargo.
Incidentally, I have been frequently dug out of
my bunk at 10 p.m. to take the ship into port, on
the chief’s watch, after having had only three hours
sleep since the previous midnight.
Is it strange that men get drowsy under such con-
ditions? Just as a bright light has its effect on the
tired officer on deck, sq have the revolving crank and
glistening connecting-rods their hypnotic effect on
the weary engineer. The puzzle to me is that ship-
owners haven’t appreciated the menace of the posi-
tion, from their banking account's point of view,
years ago.
THE PERFECT PRISONER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
An advocate of prison reform in Melbourne, points ■
out the foolishness of cropping the hair of prisoners,
and giving them uncouth and unshapely garments to
wear. The effort should be to raise their self-respect,
and cultivate something of that harmless vanity that
is the saving of thousands.
Behold, the notion likes us well!
The shaven wretch, with blue-black jowl,
Who loafs within his narrow cell,
Still owns a soul, however foul—
A soul that’s foolishly repressed
By sacrifice of flowing locks,
And by the beastly way he’s dressed,
The absence of a suit well pressed,
And hottest red and yellow socks.
We’d have him cultivate a mo. ;
With brilliantine we’d shine" it, too.
In wavy runs his hair should glow.
He’d wear the neatest kind of shoe,
Silk ties and pearly gloves and hats
To give him quite a dudish charm ;
And diamonds larger far than Fat’s
The prisoner should sport, and spats
To do the Block around the “Farm.”
Nay, more ; photographers should touch
His pictures up with lovely tints,
Reduce the chin that shoots too much,
Remove such obstacles as squints,
And print the prisoner as sweet
As actor pale, with raven wool.
We’ll save the burglar with conceit,
And have him perfectly complete—
As good as he is beautiful!

black eye of Mrs. Hill. Mr. Doyle took Mrs. Hill
quietly to the kirk at Whipstiek, and they were
marr)ed - McFadyn, who had been informed of the
tU ™ °J eve^ s ’ I )ut on the one spurt of his life, and
arrived as the small party was emerging from the
church. “Yev married Doyle the noo!” he gasped
“Wamin, yev took him!” His voice broke into a

“Bilbax”: A belief held by miners, with-
out any exception that I’ve yet met, and which no ar-
gument will disturb, is that “dynamite always strikes
downward.” In his story, “The Salvors of The Planet
Venus” (B. 9/11/’ll), Randolph Bedford adds the
weight of his testimony to this theory. I am no
scientist; but it seems to me impossible that any
explosive can exert greater force in any one given
direction —downward, upward or sideways—than in
any other. An explosion is a chemical change in-
duced in the explosive material, dynamite, gun-
powder or what not —by which its solid (or other)
matter is more or less suddenly resolved into gases.
In the nature of things, this sudden expansion of a
piece of matter into thousands of times its original
volume must necessarily be radial in its move-
ment ; and the expansive force thus exerts itself
equally in all directions. That the various mining
explosives give various results is owing (1) to the
speed with which the chemical change completes
itself, and in this connection it is to be remembered
that the speed measurement is in minute fractions of
a second; (2) to the greater or smaller volume of
expanded gases created by a given quantity of the
respective explosives. Thus, a slow explosive—say,
gunpowder—rends. It gets time to take the line
of least resistance, and to exert its full force along
that line. The quick explosive—dynamite, for in-
stance —shatters. It instantaneously “combusts,” and
its force is as instantaneously expended upon its
immediate surroundings. Gunpowder, by its more
gradually-developed combustion, shoves the bullet out
of the open end of the gun. A charge of dynamite
behind the bullet would shatter the gun-barrel. It
is up to an explosives expert to authoritatively
smite this fallacy; and for his reward I can guaran-
tee him a mangled reputation in every mining camp
in Australia.

“Eddyson”: McFadyn and Doyle were
both keeping company with the Widow Hall, and,
incidentally, with each other. Doyle would slink
into the widow’s kitchen in the evening, and dis-
pose himself at the widow’s left elbow. Sooner or
later McFadyn would happen in, and ensconce him-
self at the widow’s right elbow, and the evening
would pass sociably, the widow knitting or sewing,
and the two free-selectors assisting in an eloquent
silence. This had been going on for about a year,
when one night McFadyn looked round from his sec-
tion, and said: “Ah wadna be seerprised eef ye’re
coortin’ the leddy, Meester Doyle!” Doyle thought
the matter over. “It’s more’n likely,” he said
gravely. “Um!” said McFadyn, and winked at
the widow. The triangular courtship continued
as before. Doyle had had a magnificent crop of
potatoes, and it was his habit to take along a small
bag every time he visited Mrs. Hill. “A few
praties fer the pig, ma’am,” said he. McFadyn
brought nothing, he said nothing, but once or twice
in the evening he winked most portentously at
Widow Hill. Then came the night when Doyle from
his elbow said suddenly: “’Tis the long time we’re
keepin’ yeh, ma’am. Will yeh have me?” “I will,
Tom Doyle,” answered Mrs. Hill, and went on with
her knitting. McFadyn said nothing, but first chance
he got he winked a wink that clicked like a barn-
latch. Things continued very much as before.
McFadyn remained in careful attendance on the
lady’s right elbow. Doyle seemed content with the
left. Doyle kept up the supply of potatoes, and
McFadyn never failed to wink when he caught the

“Cellu Loid’s” despatch :
Having lived among the blacks, from Broome to
as tar east as sunrise, I can vouch for the fact that
there is no code and never was, for Binghi’s smoke
signalling.
There are a few fixed signals, such as “Ship in
sight” and “Come and anchor here,” etc., but you
would hardly call them a code, any more than you
would call a dinner-bell a code. Smoke signals can
only be worked by pre-arrangement, and practically
on the dot and dash system. Only one fire is used.
I have very often known of, and assisted in, intelli-
gence being carried hundreds of miles by this
method, but it was all arranged beforehand, and
parties stationed at different points to pass the
signal along.
Modus operandi: (1) A fire; (2) a screen woven
of green bushes; (3) three or four operators. The
fire is allowed to smoke for some time, so as to en-
able the next signal station to locate it; then the
screen (saucer-shaped) is applied, and the smoke
smothered down. By means of the screen it is then
liberated in small clouds, or long columns, as per
arrangement, the message being repeated until No. 1
signalling party sees that those on the next station
have received it correctly.
I quote one instance where a man-of-war was lying
at Gavutu, Solomon Islands. There were several
tribes, both to east and west, that had occasion to
fear a visit, and it was arranged with the local
“childlikes” that they were to signal the warship’s
course when she left. No sooner had she got fairly
under weigh than the long, thin column from “The
Thumb” —the point agreed upon—told the next
station that she had “hove up,” and when she shaped
a course to the westward, five distinct balls of smoke
were cut loose, and repeated until the next station
commenced to work the message.
In that case the signals arranged beforehand, were:
Gone to westward, five dots ; making eastward, three
columns or dashes. It took about 20 minutes to
send these signals 100 miles, and six operating
stations were engaged.'
“Arcarlo” must have been taking overdoses of
quinine when he heard a native drum 25 miles away.
I have seen the best drum ever banged in the Solo-
mon Group, and Bill Squires couldn’t make it aud-
ible five miles down the wind, even if he had his
own punch back and Sam MeVea’s thrown in.

“Frank Sharp”: The exploding boiler is
getting almost as common in N. S. Wales as the gun
which no one knew was loaded till the undertaker
had to be called in. Not so long ago, the kettle at-
tached to a factory right in front of the gaol, in a
big country town, blew out without warning. The
cannonade fortunately took place during a very
slack hour, yet it was nothing less than a miracle
that nobody was killed. The front of the gaol was
blown to pieces. Debris was littered all over the
place for hundreds of yards, and the street was knee-
deep in hot ashes, scrap-iron, and other playful
remnants. So vague is the law, that no one seems
to know who is culpable; but it cost the Govern-
ment something like £2OO to patch its gaol up.
The statement was made that the exploded boiler
had previously been condemned while in use in an-
other town; but I can’t swear to that, though it’s
just as likely to be true as not. Passing the patched-
up gaol the other day, I noticed that another boiler
had been nailed down in front of the gaol door —
precisely on the same site as the last one; and as
there is apparently nobody to see that it, too, doesn’t
get explosive, I’m swearing off all my old habits of
murder, arson and kidnapping. It’s far too danger-
ous to risk gaol in this town.
“M'allarapoonie”: I hate to contradict
anyone, but “Boronia” (B. 19/10/Tl) and
“Wandy” (B. 26/10/’ll) are a good deal beside the
question, which “White Ants” (B. 31/8/’ll)
raised when he denounced the Wilson Government’s
policy of pushing people out to grow wheat on the
hot dry horizon of Westralia, where the salmon gum
and the wilted gimlet bushes are only relieved by a
background of steel-colored sky. Instead of applying
for the immediate extermination of “White Ants,”
would “Boronia” mind applying himself to the
elucidation of these questions: (1) If what “Ter-
mites” said isn’t true, why is it that most agricul-
tural products in W.A. just now are commanding
famine prices ? (2) Why is Westralian meat so
shockingly tough and lean and expensive? (3) Why
are they running water trains out Dower in way?
(4) Why is the Ashburton jumbucli almost too weak
to travel to a shed to be shorn? (5) Why is the
Murch'son bovine mostly living on mulga? And (6)
why do the prospectors from Phillips River to Peak
Hill have to pan off their prospects with beer? As
for “Wandy” and the argument which he whirls so
joyously by the tail- —well, there have been boom-
times before which should have been gazed upon
with suspicion, but weren’t. Westralia is certainly
having a mild jag just now on the strength of
something or other. It is hard to say what really
causes a communistic spree, but the belief in the
solidarity and staying powers of a boom is always,
like “Wandy’s,” tremendous —until something pricks
the bubble, and brings the edifice down amid a cloud
of dust, so to speak. It is to be hoped “Wandy”
will be standing from under when the debris begins
to fall. I’d be sorry to see a cheery optimist like
“Wandy” hurt.
“W.S.T.”: “Montalex” (B. 16/11/T1)
confirms the allegation of a gentleman with a long
name, who said that jarrah is the only wood that
successfully resists T. navalis, better known in N. S.
Wales as cobra; and therein “Montalex” is wrong.
There are at least two Australian woods that surpass
the jarrah. In 1890, at Port Pirie (S.A.), I saw
some jarrah piles that had been turned into nutmeg-
graters by the tropic sea-worm, which was the bug-
bear of the old navigators until Muntz metal was
discovered. But bloodwood and turpentine both
defy the cobra, though the latter must not have the
bark broken, or a quick entry is made. Bloodwood,
however, impregnated as it is with a strong imper-
ishable gum, defies the enemy under any and all
conditions. Probably the resin sticks in his teeth.
“Belbowrie,” the broad-leaved tea-tree, a fine hard-
wood that reaches large dimensions, on the North
Coast of the Ma State, will also keep the worm out,
under the same conditions as turpentine—-waJi the
bark retained. Bloodwood and cypress pine knock
out the white ant in one round.
OBSERVATIONS ON COW CULTURE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
No rough noise should be allowed in the cows’
quarters. I have known loud talking to affect the
quality and quantity of xnilk from a sensitive cow.
Cows like to be kindly talked to, and singing has a
charm for them. In Switzerland, dairymaids who
can sing sometimes receive higher wages than those
who are not musical. —Quotation in daily vaver.
In fretful cities up and down
The flying tram-cars roar ;
The newsboy, yelling for a brown,
Dumps papers at the door;
Wild politicians shout and rave,
While we endure the row;
But wings of happy silence wave
Around the tender cow.
For her no harsh and grating sounds
May stir the milk-bail’s peace;
Within her quiet grazing grounds
The raging discords cease;
No clanging bell may come a-near
Her calm, unruffled brow,
Nor controversy edged with beer
Disturb the simple cow.
No child of Judah, yelling odds,
May in her paddocks strav,
Where, standing like the elder gods,
She moons her time away ;
But some trained elocutionist,
Perchance, we may allow
To linger in the morning mist
Reciting to the cow.
No wild pianos, out of tune,
That on suburban nights
Bump treason to the angry moon,
Shall shuffle her delights;
But gentle harps shall stir the air,
And elfin heads shall bow
Above the fluted reed to bear
Harmonics to the cow.
No basso, rumbling hollow notes,
Shall thunder in her ears ;
No baritones, like bleating goats,
Shall move her soul to tears,
But tenor voices, soft as silk,
Or Melba’s self, I trow,
Shall touch the inher source of milk
And profit in the cow.
And while the milkmen, up and down,
Their wares of whiteness shout
By every door in every town
To call the housewife out,
We, with our shattered nerves, must bear
The everlasting row,
While wafts of soft melodious air
Surround the placid cow.

IRRITABILITY.
Do you feel out of humor and think that every-
one has a grudge against you, because everything
seems to be going wrong ? It is you that is
“wrong,” and it is your liver that has the grudge
against you—possibly because you are not treating
it well. You have given it too much work to do,
and when it wanted a gentle laxative to set it right
you neglected to attend to it. To set your liver
right, to make things go well, and to make yourself
feel good all over, take a course of Chamberlain’s
Tablets and you will be more than pleased with the
result. Chamberlain’s Tablets are unsurpassed for
irritability.*

“The Boy” : I hasten to set “Bundarra’s”
mind at rest. Rock wallabies do climb trees, and it
is surprising what a slight lean of vegetation is needed
to givfe them a leg up. Scrub wallabies are also
climbets, but, in their case, the tree requires to be
at a greater angle than for R. Wallaby, who can
tackle anything steep, excepting, of course, the lead-
ing articles in the Tory press. They’re too perpen-
dicular.

“J.; O’N.”: “Taieri” (B. 12/10/T1) is
right—f-Australia is not the solitary home of the
sweater- °f cow children. Maoriland :ds cursed with
more than its share. I spent three years in a cow
district on the east coast of the North Island, for
half that time in charge of a creamery, and I saw
enough child-slavery to make me hate the name of
Cow for ever more. Have seen the poor kids crowd
into the engine-room on a cold morning, when they
should have been in bed, and hold their hands, blue
and numb with the cold, against the boiler to get
some warmth into them. Some of those children
had to drive two miles to the creamery, and walk
another pair of miles to school after their morning’s
work. I was with another cow of a cocky (I mean
cow cocky) for 12 months on a dairy, where the
children (oldest 12 years) milked 10 cows each
night and morning. One of the boys shared my
room, and times out of number I have found him
asleep on his knees by the bed. At other times I
have had to undress him; but often he would go
to bed with most of his clothes on. Under happier
conditions he would have been a bright lad, but,
ground down as he was, he had grown almost as
stupid as the cows he milked. What he will , be-
come in a few more years of that slavery I well
know, and knowing what I know, I say it is a
national calamity that this evil is being allowed to
spread in Australia, apparently without any general
anxiety. One day there will be no room for
anxiety, owing to a sudden inrush of alarm.
South Western Queensland, which is much
nearer the south coast, of Australia than the north,
was recently decorated with a heat wave, when tem-
peratures of 115°, 118°, and 120° were recorded. This
low-lying and rather southerly region is about the
heat centre of Australia. Yet, curiously enough, a
lot of people want to deviate the transcontinent; 1
railway at great expense, to bring it through this
country.

“Mr. Ocky” : The champion human pante-
chnicon up our way is a meek-looking individual,
whom I saw riding a heavy bicycle along a rough
track in the direction of the Federal Capital. He
was bearing a long ladder, through the middle
rungs of which his head protruded, and from
the rungs of it I noticed suspended one
pick, two saws, one axe, two billies, one
pail, one bag of tools and one anchor ( medium-
sized) ; two spades were lashed to the rungs ; and on
top of the ladder one bag of wheat and a bag of
provisions were neatly balanced. There might have
been two dog-kennels, three inkpots, one toast-rack,
one hat-box and one iron tank also attached to the
ladder, but he went past so quickly that I lost
count. I have an idea he had taken the contract to
build the Federal Capital. Can any Abo. pirate tell
me what cove he was, and mention, at the same time,
whether he is entitled to the blue-ribbon? I enter
him, anyway.

“The Sparrow” : “Vagabond” (B.
16/11/’ll) can drink his mate’s beer what time he
hands him this information. The “morepork,” or
“mo-poke,” as we know him, is really the podargus ;
still, he does remark “More pork.” It is his favorite
toast. Found a brood of three once, and kept them
for 18 months, so I ought to know. The “Oom-
moom-moom” remark isn’t owl music at all. It is
the deadly dispiriting language of the very bashful
and always well-hidden bittern.
A BAD ADVERTISEMENT.
HAIRDRESSER'S WIFE: “Dad, Charley says please don't come into the saloon for a bit."
DAD: “ And why not, pray?"
H.W.: “I ain't sure; but I think he's booking a big order for his new hair-restorer."
“R.5.V.,” his cyclone :
“Wang’s” cyclone (B. 9/11/’ll) was a mere
whirlwind to the one I took part in some years ago,
on a station in the New England (N.S.W.) district.
Prior to the disturbance, a number of signs of
trouble, similar to those mentioned by “Wang,” were
manifest. An ominous stillness prevailed on the deck
of the earth, while huge, ink-black clouds danced
wildly above the rigging. With a mate,
I was working in the open, and presently
we were making a break for the home-
stead, pursued by infuriated thunder, No.
8 hailstones, the remains of the original
Deluge and miles of lightning. I reached
Die granary and fell flat, with my arms
clutching a post. Looking out on the
disturbance, I saw that a clear pathway
had been tom through a heavy piece of
bush, and that numerous trees were bal-
looning in mid-air, and hitting 'up the
welkin with their roots. My mate was a
slow runner; the cyclone was not. It
caught him in three strides, knocked him
down, yanked him up, twirled him round
13 times for bad luck, and steered him
skyward in the geometric centre of a
cloud of fowls,, vile language, sheep, etc.
Suddenly he was swooped down into a
tree that, till then, had withstood the fury
of the performance. He was head down,
but I yelled to him to hold on tight. He
did ; he held on so strenuously that, with
the next gust, he pulled the tree up by
the roots, and dragged it across country
at a terrific pace. Meanwhile, the cyclone
was shaking the inside out of things in
all directions.. It lifted a 3601 b. pig out
of the remains of a sty, and threw it half
a mile skyward. Ten seconds later, the
fall in pork beat all records since the
slump near Galilee. A 17st. squatter was
used as a floor-cloth, and his whiskers
were driven into the back of his neck; a
tank of water was rolled off its stand;
the sun was darkened with the flight of a
vast covey of frying-pans, barrels, fenc-
ing, shovels, kerosene cans and other loose
paraphernalia; 20 acres of wheat were
mowed down and stacked, straw by straw,
in various parts of the continent; devas-
tation was loose generally, _ and if.it had
not been for my strength in holding the
granary down, it would have become a
new sign in the Zodiac. It was a great
day, and my mate has never been the
same man since. In fact, he hasn’t been at all.

“E. Inward”: Knotty pine, recently men-
tioned here, is one of nature’s poems in wood. In
the log, and stripped of its jacket, it is a mass of
cranky-looking nobs, and appears to be as tough a
proposition as a jack-plane would care to interview ;
but, as a matter of fact, the bench-saw whips
through it like butter, and, in plank form, it takes
a beautiful polish, varying from a del cate cream
through varying shades of red to a rich chocolate
brown. As for the grain, the waves and circles,
combined with the coloring, would, in a forest beauty
competition, leave the best walnut or mahogany
at the barrier. Yet, Australia splits it into posts
and rails! If some of the more aesthetic countries
had knotty pine growing in their backyard, as we
have, art furniture would take on a new lease of life.
“For 10 years we have been sledging,
sledging, and we are sick of it,” was the tale of a
deputation of tough bush battlers that lately asked
Alberton (Vic.) Shire Council to make a road up
to their Gippsland mountain homes. Wheel traffic
had all those years been impossible, so they had
been obliged to drag their cream to meet the fac-
tory waggon, through mud and slush and over the
roots of giant timber. They are plucky settlers, but
the State has apparently no use for them, else it
would have placed them on the empty spaces of
the rich Western District lands, where the roads are
good, and a man can make a home and a living
without breaking his heart in the effort. But to
do that would offend a few land monopolists, and no
recent Government in the Cabbage Garden has been
game to annoy a land monopolist.
Two young backblock Australians, who
had their doubts whether this country was what it
was cracked up to be, put on their coats last year
and lit out for “the great open spaces of S’Africa.”
They had a pretty large knowledge of stock under
their hats, and, having heard that the Boer was a
shiftless stock-raiser, they proposed to just show
Oom Piet how the thing ought to be done, and
make millionaires of themselves incidentally. They
looked around, and the more they looked the
less they thought of their stock-breeding neigh-
bors ; and then they settled down. It was
just then that a census paper fell in on them.
It was a “householder’s form,” with three schedules
to fill in. No. 3 schedule it was that gave them the
sick feeling they hadn’t got over when the last
mail left. This is how it ran:—
NUMBER OP LIVE STOCK. THAT DIED DURING THE YEAR
IST MAY, 1910, TO 30th APRIL, 1911.

There were other lists, covering the ills to which
goats and ostriches are prone in “the great open
spaces of S’Africa.” Those two Australians are look-
ing now for a Boer* who is used to nosing round in
the mornings to find out what new stock affliction has
arrived on the premises; and, when they find him,
Australia is going to get two home-sick immigrants.
About Arbitration, Confusion and Sundries.
“The Recording Angel” leans over and
says a piece :
Stand from under, while I brush away with my
near wing some of the ignorance in Australia
concerning Labor and arbitration in Maoriland. To
start with, the Shearers’ Union has not cancelled its
registration under the Act. There is no need
to do so. I mention this to lead to some of the
peculiarities in the M.L. Arbitration law. The
shearers are “workers” within the meaning of the
Act in the shearing season only, and are then, like
other unions, subject to all the pains and penalties
for promoting a strike. The shearers, therefore,
wisely do such promotion out of season, and reap the
results in season. Miners, wharf-laborers and sea-
men who justifiably consider themselves “annoyed,”
let us say, with the Court, are under its sway for
12 months in the year, and have, therefore, to take
what they get, or get out. At present they are
manifesting an emphatic preference for getting out.
The Dunedin seamen, for instance, have just voted:
For cancellation, 420; against, 5. That’s a good
working majority. The Auckland seamen have
voted: For cancellation, 160; against, 98 (out of
a 400 membership). What the result of all this will
be, nobody knows yet. Unless the men are practi-
cally unanimous for cancellation, there can be no
permanent gain, perhaps not even then. At any
rate, there is nothing to prevent the men against
cancellation retiring from the old union and form-
ing a new one, registering under the Act, and ap-
plying for the re-enactment of the old award. The
Court could hardly refuse to give this, and it
would, of course, bind the new unionists and the
non-unionists, and thus nullify the cancellation.
Then the cancellationists might join the new union,
and re-cancel registration, and so keep up the game
of perpetual motion.
All of this shows the folly of wasting much
energy on the Strike v. Arbitration question.
Workers are beginning to realise it is time they
went for bigger game, such as rent, currency, cost
of living, and so forth. As for “improving” the
Arbitration law, let the politicians see to that.
Labor-Minister Millar made a proposal to last Par-
liament, and dropped it suddenly, that a “business
man” should be made President of the Court in-
stead of a Supreme Court Judge. This is merely
the old trick of the small boy who changed his cat’s
name from Tom to Mary in order that it might
have kittens. The boy’s scheme didn’t work. Any-
how, the first qualification of an arbitrator is im-
partiality, and a “business man” is hardly likely to
be anything more than another employers’ represen-
tative, without the legal training necessary to draft
awards through which objecting parties can’t slide,
glide, wriggle or otherwise penetrate. Last time a
president was wanted for this Court, the job wasn’t
exactly rushed by the then Supreme Court Judges,
and so a special one was manufactured out of a full
blown lawyer. Experience has shown that Judges,
like poets, should be born, not made. In the cir-
cumstances, one can’t blame the Government for hesi-
tating to repeat the experiment. Somehow, you
never quite know where you are in this arbitration
business. Most of the fellows who want arbitration
in the military world have faith only in war in the
industrial world ; and most of the fellows who want
arbitration in the industrial world have faith only
in war in the military world; and there you are.
As for Labor in Maoriland, it is all over the shop.
There’s no continuity of action or consistency of
thought for 10 days together. No doubt valuable
“propaganda work” is being and has been done,
and some day we’ll reap the harvest, but just now
the Labor party is pulling one way, and the
Socialist party another way, and the great
silent vote is slowly and reluctantly withdrawing it-
self again into the so called Liberal camp. It is
doubtful if “Labor” or “Socialism” will win a single
seat in Maoriland, at the forthcoming elections.
And yet opportunity but waits the Man. The only
person who is really grasping his chances is the
Stiggins. He is absolutely wide awake, overruns
the country, and has probably got 80 per cent, of
the women’s vote in his pocket. Most women in
Maoriland are Stigginses ; they haven’t got enough
mental or moral enterprise to be anything else.
Every electorate swarms with half-parson politicians,
oozing sentimental gush about the moral force of
the womanhood suffrage. As a matter of fact, the
female franchise here is not a “force” at all. Per-
haps 20 per cent, of the women vote intelligently.
For the rest, the franchise is either a duplication of
the men’s vote, or welter of good intentions, and
woman’s good intentions have been the curse of the
business since the year ’Ol.
GENERAL RAIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
GLORIOUS RAIN.
GOOD FALLS IN THE COUNTRY.
OVER TWO INCHES IN MANY PLACES.
303 POINTS AT PORT MACQUARIE.
—Joyous daily paper headlines.
The gutters are chuckling now in town
And the telegraph’s ticking again;
Some joyful news it’s stuttering down —-
The arrival of General Rain.
He’s falling down in the North and South,
And he’s visiting out in the West;
There’s hardly a whisper now of drouth,
And the farmer’s getting his rest.
Rheumatic people are swearing hard,
And complaining of anguished joints;
But waterspouts laugh in each backyard,
And the squatters are counting the points ;
The vestments black of the good monsoon
In the heavens are dripping with gain;
It’s good to hear on the broad lagoon
The drumming of General Rain.
A patt’ring shower of diamonds falls
When the wind takes a stroll in the scrub ;
The bush-birds twitter their thankful calls
And get after the corpulent grub ;
The telegraph wires they perch upon,
Across valleys and hillsides brown,
Keep slowly ticking the wet news on,
Till the market hardens in town.
The bush fires out in the ranges die;
All the mountains have finished their smoke;
The blackened logs in the clearings lie;
And the creeks are enjoying the joke ;
The dams are full, and the prospect’s clear,
And there’s laughter and drinking again.
Australians will never fail to cheer
An invasion by General Rain!

George Lambert, the large, talkative, blus-

highly esteemed abroad, but whose recent
exhibition of pictures, in Melbourne, failed
utterly to impress the Sydney Art Gallery

and a packet of Domes of Silence.
“Melb ” on Victoria’s most persistent
pensioner:—-
Meeting some Duffys to-day, I was led to muse on
the family history. The scientific followers of

Charles Cavan Duffy was one of the feeblest-looking
specimens of humanity. lie always had the voice of
the pantaloon, which pipes and whistles. Ilis oratory,
so finely languaged, was a kind of shriek. The false
report of his death was passed round in the Vic-
torian Legislative Assembly about half a century
ago, and nobody seemed surprised. Yet he outlived
all, or nearly all, that Assembly. He produced four
clever sons by three different wives. The first was
the mother of John Gavan Duffy, able lawyer, smart
writer, efficient M.L.A. and Minister of the Crown,
and good Speaker. Yet the second marriage did
more brilliantly, with Frank Gavan Duffy, now
leader of the Victorian Bar, and Charles Cavan Duffy,
jun., Clerk of the Australian Parliament. Still there
came the third marriage, with the great Duffy aged,
and his wife young. The son o.’ this is George
Gavan Duffy, an orator of considerable dash, re-
garded in the Old World as his father’s inheritor.
“J.” tells what he saw while drinking:—
There is no nasty pride about one of our million-
aires, anyhow. 1 was imbibing in the winter garden
of the Australia the other night, and at a table near
by sat Cattle King Kidman, with a number of
affluent-looking friends. Presently a bell-boy ushered
in one of the cornpletest old bush-whackers I have
seen. With his vast, pale, fur-like whiskers waving
in the breeze, the ancient hurried up to Kidman, his
gnarled hand outstretched, and on his lips the glad
words: “ ’Ow are yer? Don’t yer know me?” Kid-
man allowed his fin to be waved up and down, but
obviously didn’t recognise the oldster, and bluntly
said so. Quoth the visitor: “Don’t yer remember
Cobar?” “Yes,” said Kidman, “I was butchering
there.” “Exactly! And I was one uv yer butchers.”.
The light of recognition filled the cattle monarch's
eyes. He pump-handled the aged product of the
wilderness with the utmost heartiness, bought him
liquor, and plunged into conversation. It struck me
that not every millionaire would publicly recall a
town by the fact that he had. butchered there, nor be
so obviously and simply glad to meet an indigent old
employee. Take it for all in all, the episode rather
raised my opinion of bullock-Czars.

“Hullo” reveals his inner sentiments:—
Generally stated, in the European press, that
George V. has become a trades-unionist, though
there are doubts whether he has yet signed the
Labor pledge. Bull’s recent strikes brought George
forth, according to the Independance Belge, as the
most successful Labor leader of the age. It is an
open secret that royal influence brought the railway
magnates to the indignity of a conference with the
leaders of the Labor unions. George’s letter of
thanks to Lloyd-George has no precedent, says the
London Post, in British annals. Of course, George
naturally objected to strikers’ processions, with so
many strangers in his capital, just when he was about
solemnly to put on a new golden hat. But he
kept the military as much as possible out of the
riots. George is a wise youth. The British royal
house usually sides with the element in the nation
which shows that it is gaining the ascendency. Its
job depends on that. The early kings leagued with
the aristocracy. The Tudors leagued with the rising
middle classes. George sees the working man on the
rise, and comes down from his perch to grasp his
big right hand. He has to. And it was George
that, for the same reason, agreed to the fall of
the House of Lords. He is said, too, to have ap-
plauded payment of members to the Commons,
whereat the Sydney morning rags and the horde of
Australian Fat Men who believe in them, must do
a new grovel. Somehow, I’ve always suspected the
I 1 at Man of disloyalty.
A few months ago, the S.
Aus. _ Government boasted
that it had given encourage-
ment to four brilliant young
Australian students —all na-
tives of the Wheat State —
by appointing them to good
positions in the public ser-
vice. They were Richard-
son, 8.A., Assistant Direc-
tor of Agriculture; Jolly,
8.A., Assistant Conservator
of r orests; Dr. Basedow,
Assistant Government Geo-
logist, and Jordan, M.A.,
Inspector of High Schools.
Now, owing, largely to petty
jealousies in the depart-
ments and the weakness of
the Government, Jolly has
gone to. Queensland, Richard-
son is in Victoria, Jordan is
moving to Sydney, and Base-
dow has resigned.
The Manchester Guardian recently re-
corded the centenary of the birth of “Ben-
digo,” who arrived on October 11, 1811, in
Nottingham. At the age of 20 years “Ben-
digo” was taken up by Jem Ward as a pupil,
and in 1833 he won nine fights. “Bendigo,”
says the Guardian, had a racehorse named
after him, “to say nothing of the big Aus-
tralian city.” It is questionable whether
the Victorian Bendigo really was named
after _ the Nottingham fighter, but there
doesn’t seem to be very convincing evidence
either way. The smasher’s proper name
was William Thompson; his “Bendigo” was
a corruption of xlbednego, he being one of
triplets who were nicknamed Shadrach,
Meshach and Abednego. In his latter days
he took to drink and became a Wowser.

“The Pariah” concerning another peda-

“D.M.R.”: (B. 26/10/’ll) omits one worthy name
from the Scotch College (Melb.) honor list. When
‘the Doc.” went to England for a trip, “Scotch” was
wet-nursed by John Garbutt, M.A. —-as remarkable
a character as “the Doc.,” though his scope was
more limited. In 1877 he was invited to take the
sadly mismanaged Ballarat College in hand. He
kept it in hand for nearly 33 years, . and “Garbutt’s
men ’ are proud of their association with the school
that he animated. Names of tonnage, both in and
out of Australia, appear on the honor board in the
fusty old Sturt-street office, for “Johnny’s” boast —
proud and just was that he turned out men first,
scholars second. If a boy would not come up to
the College standard, it was “out” for him. “The
walls of the Ballarat College have never been big
enough to hold a liar, and they never will be,” was
his benediction. He was to his boys what Arnold
was to the Rugby boys—“a beast, but a just beast.”
leaching got him down, and in 1909 he announced
his intention of retiring. The Old Boys got- busy
and a very handsome cheque was prepared. Few
men get such a tribute of manly emotion as was
paid to the old Major at the reunion in November
oi that year. He lasted very little longer, and big
men in all parts of Australia felt something in their
throats when, in the next May, they read that “John”
had passed over.
London Notes and Queries lately had
four columns about Madeline Smitli, the
central figure of a famous poisoning trial.
She died in Melbourne on September 29,
1893, her identity known to hardly any-
body. Madeline was the .eldest child of‘a
Glasgow architect, and was born in 1835.
At 21 the villain pursued her with
the usual object, and he died from
arsenical poisoning the next year. At
Madeline’s trial in Edinburgh, the jury
said “Not Guilty” to some and “Not
Proven” to other of the various indictments.
The case_ aroused extraordinary interest;
seven different publishers issued the evi-
dence in book-form, and a number of pam-
phlets discussed the guilt or innocence of
Madeline. Soon after her acquittal she
married a young physician, Dr. Tudor Horn,
with whom she emigrated to Melbourne. He
died, and she married George Wardle, and it
was as Mrs. Wardle that she passed away
in Melbourne.
Concerning an old policeman:—
Ex-Inspector of M.L. Police, Peter Pender, who has
just joined the Elysian force after 82 years’ experi-
ence of this life, mostly very strenuous, was meant
• a farmer, but dropped the hoe to grasp a baton
in the Royal Irish Constabulary. Subsequently, he
volunteered .as a member of Lord Raglan’s corps, for
service in the Crimea, where he saw the fall of Sebas-
topol and other riots. He moved on to Turkey in
Asia, and there helped the Sick Man organise some
of his cavalry regiments, before returning to Ireland
and the old Constabulary. ■ But, in a very short time,
the long trails called again and Pender sailed for
Australia. On the voyage he was elected captain of
the ship, in place of the legitimate holder of the
position, who was busy collecting illuminated snakes.
The crew had taken charge till Pender, with other
emigrants, armed themselves, and put 15 of the ring-
leaders in the ship’s “choky.” Arriving in Mel-
bourne, in 1856, Pender, after a spell at gold-digging,
joined the bobby force once more. He served under
the ill-fated Robert O’Hara Burke, and remained cop-
ping in Victoria for about six years, before accepting
an offer to help organise the police service in Can-
terbury (M.L.), Twelve months after landing there,
he was appointed an inspector, and retained the rank
until 1902, when he retired, after 40 years’ good
work. Neither the Crimea medal, the' Sebastopol
clasp, the Turkish medal, nor the M.L. long-service
medal, would melt where Pender’s gone.
Victoria’s old friend Shaftes-
bury, who was A.D.C. to Lord
Brassey, is with King George in
India, as Chamberlain; Lady
Shaftesbury is head of the Queen’s
Bedchamber. Apropos the dreadful
intricacies of the ceremonial, Mun-
shi Murad, a leading Urdu journal-
ist, has been troubled with corres-
pondents who insisted that ele-
phants ought to figure in King
George’s Delhi procession. “No,”
says Munshi; “the mahout (ele-
phant driver) who turns his back
on an illustrious Hindu potentate
must be a Brahmin. The mahout
who turns his back on such a Ma-
hometan potentate must be a holy
syed of the highest order. The
mahout who turns his back
on King George must be a
Bishop. Such cannot be found.”
Which settles it.
A towering structure has fallen
in Waikato (M.L.) in the person
of Major A. B. Boyd-Wilson, who
protruded 6ft. 71in. perpendicu-
larly. He was ex- of the 17th Lan-
cers and Inniskilling Dragoons, and
was one of Wolseley’s expedition
which got to Khartoum in 1885,
too late to be of much service to
“Chinese” Gordon. Also, he served
in India, and sampled the bullets at
Spion Kop (S’Africa) as second
in command of Thorneycroft’s
Horse. About four years 'ago he
reached Maoriland, where he grew
cherries and wrote for the papers.
“M.R.H.”: One of Australia’s
Marathon pressmen, Tom E. Mono-
ban, of Melbourne Herald, will
celebrate his 72nd birthday this
month. For 57 years he has been
padding the paragraph along the Inky Way,
and 31 of these years have been spent in the
Victorian capital. A couple of years ago he
placed himself on the retired list, but find-
ing it was no place for an energetic youth
he hurried back to his workshop, where he
intends to remain until he grows old. He
reckons he is bound to grow old some day.

Two episodes occurred in Sydney last
week. Federal Labor Minister O’Malley
tried to come to terms with State Labor
Minister Dacey about some land needed for
defence purposes at Liverpool. No terms
were come to, because the inferior Federal
Labor Minister couldn’t suggest any terms
good enough for the superior State Labor
Minister. Then, N.S.W. Labor Premier
McGowen met Victorian anti-Labor Premier
Murray and Victorian anti-Labor Minister
Watt, and in just no time the harmonious
three came to terms on the subject of fight-
ing the Federal Labor Government’s Com-
monwealth Bank schemes to the bitter end.
“The Old Soldier” :
Britain appears to have risked a lot in the name
ot the Entente Cordiale. What the plain man is be-
ginning to ask is: Is the French alliance of much
value, anyhow ? France is heavily handicapped as
regards its navy ; the perpetually recurring accidents
to F rench battleships have unnerved the crews. There is
astory effect that M. Delcasse, the present
Minister for Marine, when he attended the naval
manoeuvres at Toulon, a little while before the blow-
ing up of the Liberte, did so with fear and tremb-
ling, and while the salutes were being fired, expected
that every round would be followed by the shin that
fired it going up into the air in a burst of flames/ After
al l that has happened, it is more than doubtful
whether the French navy would go into action
against an enemy with any confidence. It is by no
means certain that the army is very much better.
Political influence is said to be rampant, in the sense
that officers connected with the aristocratic Faubourg
St. Germain —-the stronghold of the royalist faction-
have their promotion retarded, and are often kept
unemployed, unless they are willing to volunteer
for service in “the Black Force” or colonial troops.
Then, the railways, which would be of the first im-
portance for the defence of the country, are still in
the grip of Private Enterprise, in contra-distinction to
those of Germany, which are now worked and man-
aged by the military railway corps, with every pos-
sible precaution against accident. Only the other day
we had news of a French railway bridge collapsing
while a train was crossing, close to the great mili-
tary station of Saumur, in central France; where the
central cavalry school and many other establishments
are. They are certainly points against the French
alliance.
“D.M.W.”: “Speakin’ of sermons,” said
the spragger, talking through a mouthful of
nails, “give me the sermon that is really good
or the sermon that is really bad. I ain't ’ad
much experience of the real good ones, but,
my oath, I’ve ’eard some of the best bad ser-
mons ever turned out of a.gospel mill. There
was Sniffkins come to our church last April.
’E’s the bloke for your money. Lord, but I
admired that cove! ’Ow ’e done it, that’s
what gets over me. If I was a preacher
bloke, an’ tried to preach bad for a bet, I
couldn’t ’a’ done it no better. I put ’arf-a-
crown in the plate! It was worth it. ’E
’ad Moses in the bulrushes with Pharaoh’s
daughter, an’ Lot’s wife, an’ Joe Ward, an’
the totalisator, an’ John Knox, an’ no-
license, an’ Moody an’ Sankey, an’ spiritual-
ism, an’ original sin, an’ ’is wife’s new baby
that mixed up that you couldn’t tell which
was the baby an’ which was sin an’ which
was Moody in the bull-Pharaoh. When ’e
got fair tangled up, ’e tried to push ’is way
out by way of the Devil, but it seemed the
Devil wasn’t havin’ any, so ’e tried again
with Lot’s wife; but that old party barred
the road, too; an’, finally, Sniffkins an’ Jere-
miah ’ad/ a go, Lancashire style, an’.' ’e
wrestled with the prophet, down an’ up, over
the Kings of Israel and the (twelve Apostles,
till they both knocked their ’ends on thp cor-
ner of the Book of Revelation, an’ Sniffkins
’e up an’ ’e shut the Book, an’ says ‘Amen.’
It was a willin’ go. I’ll back Sniffkins to do
the best bad sermon of any preacher bloke
in the Dominion.”

In good, vivid Australian, this office has taken a
pull on itself. It had certainly been going the pace. For
many previous years it had been stagnant; then it go?
wha? ff>ii ,IGW , ’ °° r ?’ and hustle was not the word for
U T ed - It no doubt felt that it was neces-
sary to make a splash in order to get into the public
eye again. Now, having more or less got there, it
in iQ°n P o Pmg I 0 ° f its more questionable methods,
in 1909, in the Ordinary branch, it hustled in 19,146
r.Pf™ 8 ' and in 1910 15,731. In the past year
the total was only 9665. The immediate result is
a reduction in the expense rate from £22 19s 7d
P- c - of t , otal mconie in 1910, to £l6 9s. 2d. p.c. in
491 . 1 -,, As . e y ei T engine-driver or motor-man knows,
it is the last tew extra miles per hour that lick up
the coal or the petrol. Here, in every £lOO of in-
come, there is a saving* of £6 10s. by going at the
much reduced, but still very reasonable, speed. That
CX m if 9 49s ‘ Produced big business figures; but it
couldnt produce big bonuses, and big bonuses count
in the long run for more, perhaps, than anything
else. Forced business is always liable to be uncer-
tain, too ; and the policy that only lasts for a year
or two mostly isn’t worth getting. One of the finest
sources ot so-called profit in an insurance office is
the habit so many policy-holders have of living and
paying premiums long after they ought to be dead,
according to the actuarial calculation. The insurer
who comes in this year, and drops out next year, ob-
viously doesn t give the office a chance to make pro-
fits m that way. During 1909 and 1910 the new
policies issued carried premiums of £128,057 p.a.
Yet the total income increased by only £28,848 be-
tween 1909 and 1911. Allowing liberally for loss
of premium income through death and maturity
claims, it is quite clear from this that the lapse rate
has been very serious indeed. A much reduced ex-
pense rate will, no doubt, make policy-holders hang
on to their policies more strenuously.
The next table shows how the expense rate has
moved m all three sections of the business:

Still, in connection with the expense rate, one must
mbf/d TT® the amount of new business ob-
tained. And on that basis the improvement in the
past year isn t what it looks in the table. There is
no way of telling absolutely what the cost of new
in si ness is ; but this paper’s plan for arriving at an
approximate figure is to charge the renewal income
with 7 p.c. for collection, management, etc., and
assume that the balance of the exes, is the cost of
the new business. On that plan it will be found
that in 1910 the new business cost 76 p.c of the
new premiums collected, while in 1911 it cost a
shade under 7o p.c. ; the renewal business is as-
sumed to have cost the same—7 p.c. in each case.
Ihe shrinkage m the cost of getting the new busi-
ness thus amounts to only 1 p.c., and is disappoint-
ing. The costs of the Industrial department are
however, highly creditable.
The interest earnings are good. Calculated on
average funds, they show up as follows:
1904 .. £4 9 1 p.c. 1908 .. £4 9 7n c

4999 •• 4 9 1 „ 1910 .. 4106 ;;
1907 .. 492,, 1911 .. 410 9
The office has 39 p.c. in public securities, 354 p.c. on
mortgage, 14 p.c. on other loans, and 9 p.c? in pre-
mises. The directors say that “the assets have been
subject to special review, and there is no item that
requires to be written down.” That is satisfac-
tory; but it would be more satisfactory if, in view
of the present high level of most securities, there
were some reserve fund to provide for probable de-
preciations. There is no such fund, and no part of
the surplus now ascertained by the actuary is ear-
marked for the purpose. Hitherto actuarial valua-
tions and bonuses (when available) have appeared
every five years. An annual instalment is now
begun. In the Ordinary department a surplus of
£28,286 is declared, and £16,639 is divided —lO
p.c. of the year’s total premiums. A small bonus is
also paid on policies of the age of 10 years and over
in the Industrial department. This latter distribu-
tion is, however, mainly of the show-window de-
scription, inasmuch as last year the actuary reported
that “the average age of the policies to be valued is
four years, owing to the fact that practically the
whole of the business has been acquired within the
last decade.”

ni'Joi great . banb ’ s figures have been rounded off
nicer* again. Commencing in 1818 with a caDifal
dav-fin*^ 11 ( c " riousl y it; reckoned in those
aays in Spanish dollars), the amount was gradually
brought up to £2,000,000, at which it stood for a
good many years. In 1907 there was a plain call
for more capita!, and £600,000 was issued. But
Australia has been making such rapid progress under
b ® nlgn influence of its manifold curses, that the
call was soon heard again, and now the paid capital
has been brought up to £3,000,000, the last £5OO 000
being issued at a premium of £125,000. And even
now the bank’s funds are on the small side, so
rapidly has the business grown. Five years ago,
when the capital was £2,000,000, the bank held
moTv TV T teS C etc ') . £29,125,956 of public
money. That is to say, it had about £8 9s. of the
public s for every £1 of its own. Though the in-
stfp S v?i C xPi ta 1 1 r has . °” ly been completed, it
ctill holds £7 15s. of the public’s for every £1 of
its own, the public money (deposits, notes, etc.)
c>7o n o;O fave yearß & rown from £29,125,956 to
,348, or an average of over £2,000,000 a
year. There is no Plimsoll mark in the banking
business ; one bank might safely carry 10 times its
own weight, while another would be overloaded with
halt that much. But when the proportion gets be-
yond seven to one, it is generally assumed that the
limit of safety has been pretty well reached. If,
therefore, this bank’s deposits go on swelling, it is
highly improbable that the capital will stay where
it is. And it would not be fair to either the credi-
tors or the shareholders that it should.
The average increase in the figures has been more
tnan maintained during the past year:

There has thus been a very large increase in the ad-
vances. No doubt land—and especially country
land subdivision has had a big influence on the
totals. The banker curses the land tax, and there’s
some sympathy coming to him when he has to pay
it on the aggregate value of perhaps a couple of
hundred un-cut-up-able city and town allotments on
which he carries on his business ; but, to atone for
thiit, the tax is sending a lot of trade his way. And
it ought to be good trade, too. The subdivision syn-
dicate or speculator puts up his few thousands and
borrows the rest from the bank at 4$ or 5 p.c.'; the
big landlord drops the syndicate "or speculator’s
cheque back into the bank, and the bank pays him 3
or 3* p.c. for it. It is fine, profitable business ; and
given two or three good seasons to start with, there
is very little risk in it, because in most cases within
three years the purchaser is expected to pay off 25
p.c. of the price. These transactions have swollen
bank figures of late years, and though, no doubt,
subdivisions will go on so long as the graduated
land tax remains, it is altogether too much to expect
that they will continue with their recent energy.
Hence, even with good seasons, bank figures pro-
bably won’t go on growing as they have done lately.
As usual, the B.N.S.W.’s cash position is very
strong. Of the £39,572,348 of the public’s money,
no less than 46 p.c. is held liquid. The percentage
has been higher ; but 46 p.c. is more than ordinary
prudence calls for ; yet it will very likely be in-
creased as the wool clip and harvest cheques are
cashed. The earnings, calculated on capital and re-
serves combined, are about £8 16s. p.c.; the figure
can t be stated precisely on account of some of the
capital and premium having dropped in at odd times
during the term. There are banks showing a bigger
return. The ’Asia, for instance. But the ’Asia has
cut down its visible reserves by writing down its
, premises account to a mere £108,863; and that of
course, has the effect of inflating the ’Asia’s rate of
earnings, calculated on capital and visible reserves

Another disaster has happened. “The passing of the
1 ederal Land Tax ' Act .imposed so heavy a burden
upon some of the_ stations owned by the co., as to
render a sale advisable.” And as everybody knows
that the tax has utterly destroyed the value of land
of course this unfortunate co. had to give the stations
away with a pound of tea. At least, that’s what
ought to have happened. But it didn’t; on the con-
trary, the co. got such a rattling price for its land
that it has added £lOO,OOO to the reserve fund; in
other words, it got that much more than the proper-
ties were valued at in the co.’s own books. The ex-
planation is quite simple. As a sheepwalk, Jumbuck
Springs was worth £3 an acre. As agricultural
areas the same place is worth perhaps £4 10s. an
acre. So long as Jumbuck was held as one vast
sheepwalk, the graduated land tax pinched and
pinched hard; its imposition undoubtedly depre-
ciated the value oi the estate as a sheepwalk, but
didn’t in the least affect the value of it as a bundle
of possible farms. This is exactly what the land tax
was designed to do. It didn’t aim at the spoliation
of the big landlords ; that was the mere cackle of
the parasite politicians who say what they think the
Fat man wants to hear. This case confounds the
cacklers, and shows how the Fat man is getting tens
of thousands of pounds more than he said his pro-
perty was worth. The co. transfers £lOO,OOO in a
lump to the reserves ; and it probably made a good
deal more, which it is keeping up its sleeve.
What the co. is going to do with the money which
it is getting for its properties this paper doesn’t
kl } ow ; Probably it will take it away. It certainly
will if it can see the chance of doing, in some other
new country, what it lias done in Australia—that is
buy up land early and cheap in big lumps, and sell
it later for bigger prices in small lumps. If that is
driving capital out of the country, well and good.
If a man in Melbourne owned a big block of ground
in the heart of Svdney, and used it for grazing goats,
and if we then taxed him until we compelled him
u u 1 1 U P ar *h se h for more rational uses, we
should also be “driving capital out of the State.”
But what Sydney man would be fool enough to say
that the capital represented by the goatwallc was
domg any good while it stayed in the country ?
On the contrary, it might be doing a vast amount of
harm. There is no particular wish to see this co.’s
capital, now that it has changed its form, shipped
oft to some other part. There is good use for it
here —-in financing the smaller men, for instance.
Apparently, however, the co. isn’t sure whether there
is enough profit in that; anyhow, as the remark on
top of the table shows, it has lately changed its
name. Formerly it had the right to trade only in
Australia. Now, under its new articles, it can go
afield.
The co.’s share capital is £520,000, but it has de-
/vn Ck (, ! 4 P- 0 -) representing another
£1,9/3,4i0, and other liabilities total £235,845.
Most of this money is represented on the other side
by a composite item —“Loans on land, stations and
stock ; and properties owned by the co., £1,817,988 ”
or, with advances on wool, etc., £1,872,509. The
cash position, owing to the property sales, has be-
come stronger. This shows the movement during
10 years past:—

mises .. .. .. 469,356 273,921 272,204
Besides adding nearly £200,000 to its visible re-
serves in 10 years, and paying an 8 p.c. div. as an
average, the co. has thus made a tremendous reduc-
tion in its risks, judging them on paper. Perhaps it
had better think twice before it quits Australia,
after all. ’

It is a quaint anomaly that, the more outrageous
the encroachments of labor” become, the bigger
the profits these cos. make. They ought to be just
bleeding to death; instead, they get more rotund
than ever, and buy themselves a fatter cigar. It
wasnt so in the good old days. This co., for in-
stance, was formed in 1888, and it didn’t pay a
dividend for 11 years. On the contrary, it lost, or
thought it had lost, so much money that the 40s.
shares had 7s. knocked off them to counterbalance
the depreciation of assets. After that things began
to improve a trifle; but still, as the table shows,
after charging capital account with the timber
removed, a big deficit remained, notwithstanding the
reduction of capital. In 1907, timber, like most
other things (labor included), having increased in
price, it was decided to re-value the remaining
assets. Timber (standing) was reckoned at £382,510
in 1907 ; next year, after the re-valuation, it stood
at £547,112. The total writing up of assets'
amounted to no less than £227,458. That suggests
that the declared profits in this business are little
more than guesswork. You chop down a tree, and
the timber nets £25, after paying exes. But how
much of that £25 you call profit depends entirely
upon how much you reckon your assets have been
depreciated by the destruction of the tree ; and that
is probably a very difficult thing to arrive at, and
when you have arrived at some figure, you are liable
to find out 20 years later that you arrived at the
wrong one.
In the past year, gross profits on “timber and
stores sold, gum and flax, royalty, etc., after making
provision for bad and doubtful debts,” were £90,726;
and that means that the co.’s sales of timber ex-
ceeded, at a rough guess, £250,000; yet all the de-
preciation written off timber lands (including lease-
holds) was £2846. The asset now stands at
£264,804 ; and as only about 1 p.c. p.a. is written
off, it would suggest that the co. can see a very long
life ahead of it. There is, however, no evidence to
support such a supposition. Last year the M.L.
Lands Department went very thoroughly into this
kauri timber business, and found that there was only
enough to last the saw-millers for about 35 years,
without taking into account the inevitable losses
that periodically occur through bush fires. S. I.
Clarke, president of the Builders and Contractors’
Federation, who was a member of the Timber Com-
mission, declares that that estimate is too opti-
mistic. “The N.Z. Handbook,” published by the
Government, alleges that “the kauri is rapidly dis-
appearing. At the present rate of consumption, it is
considered that there will be no milling kauri left in
the Dominion in 15 years, exclusive of the Crown re-
serves.” Certainly the destruction of the timber
doesn’t destroy the land, and much of the kauri
country is very rich; but, on the opinions quoted,
it seems clear that the co.’s life, as a timber-getter,
is strictly limited. So far as this paper knows, no
estimate has been published of the value of the co.’s
land, apart from the timber standing upon it. Es-
pecially in view of the rapid exhaustion of the timber
supplies, the investor needs, then, to know more than
the accounts tell him.
Meantime the co. is no doubt doing remarkably
well, and, besides paying 8 p.c. divs., is piling up
liquid assets. This shows the movement in 10 years:
, , 1901. 1909. 1910. 1911.

Deficit .. .. £179,268 _ ~Z
Surplus.. .. £77,279 £85,741 £164,385
Liquid assets here include everything except timber
and timber lands, plant, stores and stocks. Stores
and stocks represent another £241,116 ; so that the
surplus of liquid assets, .plus stores and stocks, totals
£405,501, or about 13s. 9d. in the £ of the capital.
Assets not included in that amount are the standing
timber and timber freeholds and leaseholds and the
plant and vessels, valued in the books at £329,472;
but this paper won’t even make a wild guess as to
what that lot is really worth. The paid capital of
the co. is £585,000.

There are stores in pretty well every capital which
don t give credit. But to the customer who looks
good, it’s: “Wefre very sorry we Can't do it our-
selves, but if you like to go round to Jedekiali’Sj
666 Blank-street, I’m pretty sure he’d let you have
the money, or we’d take his order.” So the cus-
tomer goes round to Jed., whose business it is to
weigh marks and tell whether they are good or not;
and if presently there’s any squeezing to be done,
Jed. does it, and the store isn’t known in the un-
pleasant business. That development of modern
trade suggested this “bank” to the people who run
the Civil Service stores in Melbourne; It doesn’t)
of course; confine itself to advances to people who
want goods from the stores ; but that’s the chief ob-
ject. In six years £19,000 has been lent to 175(1
borrowers, and, it is said, only one loss has been
made. The co.’s capital is only £2343, and it could
do with more; but while it is feeling its way ami
practically learning the business, it is far better for
it to have too little than too much.

This society works almost wholly on its own money ;
its capital is £34,340, and deposits and all other lia-
bilities amount to only £3515. The creditors, there-
fore, run no risks, and though the shareholders may
lose their own money, they can’t suffer much damage
through losing somebody else’s. On the other hand,
they are in hardly any danger of becoming bloated
through the profits made out of somebody else’s
money. It is a mild business, specially suited to
elderiy people and those who have weak hearts and
can’t stand excitement. Dr. “Jimmy” Boyd is chair-
man of directors, and he can’t be a day more than a

Some of the figures in the last line are estimates;
the dividend is “upon the equation value of invest-
ing shares,” and that value isp’t ascertainable pre-
cisely. Of the reserves £22,403 belongs to a con-
tingency fund —“provision against probable losses.”
The amounts drawn from this fund vary from
year to year, and this, of course, affects the net
profits shown above. A truer view may perhaps be
got from this: —■

Tnat shows the past year in a rather better light, so
iar as ordinary business profits are concerned, though,
as the £790 written off represents ascertained losses,
there isn t much satisfaction in putting this year’s
profits m one pocket if last year’s drop out of a hole in
another. How much more may be expected to drop out
there is no way of telling: the assets may be over-
valued or they may not. If they are over-valued (and the
contingency fund is a “provision against probable
losses ), it would be a good deal better to cut out
the bogus values at once. “Advances,” “real
estate ’ and “society’s building” all appear in the
balance-sheet as “at book value,” and this isn’t a
remark that inspires confidence. Still, the reserves
are very substantial; and, if the assets were written
down with an axe by the most ferocious of valuators,
it isn t at all likely that the amount lopped off
would outweigh all the reserves. For this and
other reasons creditors are very well secured This
however, shows the point better:—

this is one of the most interesting, and at present
is also one of the most profitable, mining ventures in
which Australia has taken a hand many years
past Captain Teddy Miles, who had had aVried
not to say variegated, political and other career in
wm snfS’al ‘r SCOV n Gd the Property. Captain Teddy
was special Jam Commissioner or something of the
people of Tasmania, when
he brougnt it under their nose. There, was a big shal-
low harbor with a river running, or rather loiter-
ing, into it; and he saw Chinese and natives dam-
ming back the sea and digging tin out of the bottom.
The Hon. Edward at once assumed that the harbor
bottom was all tin or thereabouts, and got a con-
cession; m return for the right to get rich, he was
to dredge a channel through the shallows and scoop
out a dock, and pay certain royalties. It was only
when engineers got on to the spot that it was found
out that what the concessionaire had undertaken to
do was just about impossible, and things began to
look very blue for the co. that had meantime been
formed m Tasmania. To make things worse the
first three dredges that were put on to the iob’ were
so structurally defective as to amount to a huge
failure. It was while things were in that condition
that a strong financial crowd in Melbourne, led bv
the Baillieus, bought an option from the co. What
.looked like the best of advisers were sent to Puket
or Tongkah ; and they turned the whole thing down
with tremendous energy. It was probably the Bail-
lieus’ worst miss of the past seven years.
But Captain Teddy Miles wasn’t beaten j'ust because
an almost impracticable quid pro quo had been de-
manded by the Siamese Government. He went to
Bangkok and other quaint places, and argued with

that Captain E. Miles distributed golden sovereigns
for —for services rendered. That would be bribery
and corruption, and there is none of that in “the
East.” Captain Miles merely secured the commuta-
tion of the dock-and-channel terms in return for
£35,000 (at least, that is the sum mentioned)
£7OOO cash, and £3500 every six months for four
years. This variation was effected in time to be re-
ported bv the directors 12 months ago. And at this
point it ought to be noted that the present accounts
don’t mention anything about this liability. The P.
and L. account 'shows merely that £10,500 was
paid during the year; the balance-sheet doesn’t
hint that another '£24,500 is payable. This has
been characteristic of Tongkah management all
through. So far as shareholders and the public have
been informed, its cloud has been all silver-lining all
the time.
There certainly is more silver-lining now than
there ever was before. Apart from Miles’s triumph
in the argument with Siam, Bluck has done great
things as engineer and general manager. Bluck
used to have a good job on the Manchester ship-canal
construction, and, though his Araluen (N.S.W.)
steam-shovel enterprise came a cropper, he has proved
himself a first-rate dredge man at Tongkah. The
first three dredges—built in Holland, because the eo.
wanted to keep sweet with the Dutch tin people—■
have been practically reconstructed, and the cost has
been charged to working exes. Two new dredges got
to work about the middle of the year, and they are
apparently all right. The last line in the table says
that £3OOO has been written off during the term.
There is another £2120 said to have been written
off; hut this is apparently an amount which the co.
hopes to recover from the makers —a Scotch firm—■
on account of late delivery. The five dredges are
now valued at £76,322. The amount to he written
off them should be governed by their own life or the
life of the property, whichever is the shorter. The
life of the property is, however, most uncertain. The
idea that the whole harbor bottom is a dredging pro-
position seems to have now been pretty well aban-
doned. The management has found what it thinks
is the.old bed of the river. Says Bluck: “Just as I
was taking charge on April 1, No. 1 dredge was
moved over to crosscut it. This crosscut is now
(October 15) 1600 ft. long, all in river detritus...
The results right through have been good, and the
eastern bank of the ancient river has not yet been
reached, as it rather appears to split up into a delta
on that side.” The new dredges have been working
“as nearly as possible longitudinally along the couise
of the old bed,” No. 5 starting 1$ mile out from the
embankment, where Captain Teddy saw the Chinese
getting the tin originally. In the 12 months the
five dredges have made (say) £60,000 net out of
54 acres. If the bed is a mile wide and li mile
long, there will be 960 acres—with the outward ex-
tension unprospected. That suggests an easy propor-
tion sum ; and the man who disregards the it
mentioned, and, doesn’t reflect that tin has lately
been a phenomenal price, may fall in, and hurt him-
self badly after he has worked it out. On September
30 the co. owed £20,371 (mainly on debentures due
June, 1915), and had £35,551 in liquid assets.
Bathurst (N.S.W. , National Advocate
Newspaper Printing and Publishing Co., which pro-
duces a very presentable paper on a live capital of
only £2342. seems, after a long struggle, to have
put itself pretty definitely on the dividend list. Last
year it made a profit of £416, after allowing £214
for depreciation. A 5 p.c. div. is paid—the fourth
in 23 years.

Mr. Pion, director of the Societe Cale-
donienne des Mines, which has nickel and .copper in-
terests in New Caledonia, told Sydney press inter-
viewers last week that the French possession was
now emerging from a period of depression. While
the convicts were pouring in, the island was not com-
pelled to rely upon its mineral resources for susten-
ance. Now, however, nickel-smelting works are in
operation at Noumea, and a plant is being erected at
Thio. A small electric plant at Tao had proved a
success, and a larger one was contemplated. Every-
thing is brightening up, because they now begin to
treat locally the low-grade ores that it does not pay
to ship. The Sydney press did not. record, the fact
that this cheerful state of things had been brought
about by the French Government’s action in impos-
ing an export duty on crude ores, and granting
several kinds of bonus to the co. which first erected
smelting ■works and produced matte. The imposition
of an export duty has not stopped the exportation of
rich ores from New Caledonia altogether, but it lias
resulted in the lower-grade ores being treated locally,
and that’s what pleases the New Caledonia residents
and puts fresh life into the country.
The exportation of rich ores automatically comes
to an end sooner or later, because, all the world
over, the rich ores soon exhaust themselves, and, inci-
dentally, the country too, unless that country has
equipped itself with reduction plants to treat the poor
ore which is always with us. New Caledonia has
seen this, and has started in with its export duty
and bonus, while there is yet some rich ore to pro-
vide a backbone. Presently it will, in all proba-
bility, increase its export duty, and additional local
works will be the result. Then there will be still
more cheerfulness reported from the late convict
island. Meanwhile, Australia goes on sending its
ores to the foreigner, who may presently plug us with
bullets made from our own lead, daintily encased
in our own copper.
Broken Hill won’t want for water this
summer. The year’s rainfall promises to he a record.
The highest total hitherto was 17.9 in. in 1887 ; this
year, to December 1, the B. H. Water Supply Co.’s
catchment had 16.£8in. The fall in November was
heavy; hut the year throughout has been good—in
a pastoral way just about the most prolific the N.S.W.
Far West has had for 25 years.
Great Cobar will shut down its reduction
plant from the 16th inst., and keep it shut till
January 2. As underground work will go on, the
management should he able to make a better show
in the January-March quarter, esoecially if the con-
centrators are a success. That mill, by the wav, was
promised for November; but it will be well into
January before it makes a start.

The Warden is tired of granting labor-
suspension to the mostly-English co. that owns the
Lloyd copper mine, Burraga (N.S.W.), and has inti-
mated that some definite plan for future working
must be submitted by December 22.
* * * *
The Amalgamated Hill End’s mill is on
the way to the mine, and the new. co. has a fair
quantity of stone ready for it to try its teeth^on.
General-manager Sutherland, of the Com-
monwealth Oil Corporation (N.S.W.), has arrived in
Australia, presumably to try to sell the co.’s railway
line to the State—a scheme which would put the
water-logged co-. in funds again for a while.
British Broken Hill report for the half-
year to June 30 arrived from London by last mail.
It doesn’t say much more than was already known.
On June 30 the eo. owed £41,339, mainly on 6
p.c. debentures, but it had £51,746 in liquid assets,
including £18,523 sundry debtors, and £12,0 44 in
sundry foreign investments, worth now, however,
rather less than £ll,OOO. The management tells
again the story of the finding of the ‘new body,
and guesses that there are 2,000,000 tons of ore in
reserve, though, admittedly, not half this quantity is
proved bv openings on three sides. In fact, nearly
all the “proving” has been so far done by drills, and
they are unreliable cattle. The half-year showed a
profit of £18,504, of which £3422 was written off.
This was derived from 63,370 tons ore, from the sale
of residues (£6660), and from the retreatment of
34,845 tons of tailings for zinc. Even if all the
profit were credited to the ore, it would amount to
just under 6s. per ton, which is a pretty wretched
return, all things considered. Allowing -that there
has been a great change for the better in the British,
it is quite easy to over-estimate the prospects.
For the year ended July 31, Kalgurli
(W.A.) recovered £299,619, as compared with
£332,522 obtained from practically the same ton-
nage during the previous 12 months. Since July the
average yield has been further reduced, and while
the working stopes show an all-round improvement,
the bottom of the mine is giving the management
such concern that any possibility of the grade being
put up again is very remote. * #
Hannan’s Reward (W.A.) held a cheer-
less annual gathering in London on the 20. h ult.,
when a long discussion took place m regard to the
future. Several shareholders warned the assets
(Is. 6d. per share) distributed, but the dnectors,
who get fees and perks, would not hear ot such a
preposterous proposal. Eventually they blew out le
opposition, and brought the meeting to an end.
In a recent managerial report, Whim Well
(W A.) is estimated to have about 50,000 tons ot
copper ore at grass, in addition to “large tonnages
developed underground.” Working capital has been
provided for the co.’s subsidiary Mons Cupn, and it
is stated that the development previously done by the
Whim Well is being continued with re-
sults. During the-past 15 months the Whim Well
Co. has paid 121 p.c. in dividends, and after provid-
ing for directors’ fees and dividend tax {£>22,11),
and writing off £4650, there remains £->614t0
carrv forward. With best selected copper at £6O
per 'ton, the Murex plant, with which the property
fs now being equipped, is expected to earn a gross
profit of about £50,000 per annum. #
Bull Ant (W.A.) managed to nick a
month’s additional exemption in the local Warden s
Court the other day. Close on £4OOO was alleged
to have been spent to date, in fruitlessly searching
for the continuation of the 4oz. reef and the sur-
rounding schist that carried gold, and the object ol
the further respite from labor conditions was to give
the liquidator a little extra breathing-time, pending
the arrival of managing-director D. L. Doolette irom
London on December 11. #
Lake View South’s worldly assets are now
officially stated to be divided into three sections:
(1) Poor, hut honest, revenue from tribute opera-
tions on the Italgoorlie leases; (2) a small share in
a London eo., with hopes of being able some day to
float off alleged oil wells in Russia; (3) £5OO in-
vested in an Alaskan gold-dredging concern, which
“holds an enormous area.” The directors claim that
they are using the co.’s resources to the best advan-
tage, and hope by this means to eventually come out
on top. Some time ago a suggestion was made by
Dr. Maclaren, the geologist, as to thw development
of the Kalgoorlie property, but so far the Board has
not seen its way to carry out the proposals, nor have
any discoveries made by the tributors caused them
to think that the time has come to do so. #
Sunset Co. (W.A.) has decided on a new
lay. At the time of flotation, in the early part of
this year, the value of the ore in its Yilgarn show
was estimated up to lOoz. per ton. Later on the
discovery of telluride was reported, and on top ot
this came the doleful announcement that an unpay-
able crushing had been put through a local milt
Now, after the expiration of a few silent moutfis, the
announcement is made that some diamond drillig
is to be done, and that if results are good, an effort
will he made to raise additional capital by means of
a new share issue. Under circumstances such as
these, drill-core assays ought to be accepted only
with special caution. # *
Associated Northern (W.A.) thinks it has
fluked a good thing in its Ora Banda purchase Ore
reserves below ground are computed at 159,000
tons, valued at £193,500, while the pile at grass is
supposed to hold 4000 tons, worth £5OOO. Share-
holders who are not forcibly struck by these figures
are asked to note that 9000 tons included and
valued in the underground estimate at 80s. per ton
really assay 120 s. A plant capable of treating 10,000
tons of oxidised ore per month is to be erected with-
out delay; and, owing to the soft nature of the lode-
stuff, its amenability to treatment and low cost of
mining, manager Roberts thinks that all gold con-
tents above 10s. per ton, minus loss in residues, will
he gross profit. The price paid for the show was
£22,000 cash. #
A certain set of Bendigo people are feeling
angry over Golden Pyke. Ask them if any local
pressman’s opinion about a mine is worth a peanut,
and they snort disdain. But they don’t relish snent
indifference in return; and that is what is ruffling
them over Golden Pyke. From time immemorial,
men like Plues, Michelson, Pearce, Davies, and their
colleagues in press mining work, have popped up and
down shafts, climbed stopes and descended winzes, to
spy out the strength or weakness of developments.
Once or twice attempts have been made to shut them
out, to keep them to visiting days, or to compel the
use of an order. Golden Pyke tried this game on, so
Golden Pyke has to be content with no word other
than the purely formal notices sent out from the
office, and people outside don’t swallow these scraps.
So the market is flat, and the public won’t come m,
wherefore wails reach the Bendigo dailies over the
absence of disinterested newspaper criticism. With
a Journalists’ Association to give backbone to the
weaklings, the newspapers are letting their men gang
their gait. So the Golden Pyke gets no notices, and
the ordinary investor is the better, inasmuch as theic
are more promising shows near by which don t shut
out mining journalists six days a week and permit
them to look in only on visiting day.
Gippsland Copper and PlaJinum Co. is out
on a new smelting campaign, and is hustling up a bat-
tery to handle the ounce stuff reported by the Wes-
leys. Dyson, wise man, has been in no haste to get
going, and with the supplies he has assembled, he
should soon have a clear run on the “contact stuff.
He has this advantage—he won’t start with a halo of
glory round his chestnut head. All the froth has
been blown off the pewter in respect to the first ship-
ment by the German buyers, who find the platinum
in the matte much below the assays on this side.
Officially, the opinion is that the figures given
“practically’’ bear out the assays here —an assertion
hard to follow; The German report is that platinum
boils down to under 2oz. per ton of matte, against
about 640 z., as locally computed. Thus, Dyson will
make his start with shareholders prepared for the
worst.

Brilliant Deeps, Charters Towers, has
driven past the 90ft. mark, along its western No. 4
level, and reports an improved reef 3ft. wide in the
face.’ The last crushing of 202 tons, for an average
of £3 135., was very disappointing, compared with
the earlier £9 per ton ; nevertheless, the share
market on the Towers has regained some of its con-
fidence in Deeps now that No. 4 is showing an im-
provement, and a fair start has been made to drive
No 5. The latter is expected to reach the shoot of
stone in a shorter distance than the level overhead
(No. 4) had to # #
Kelly’s Queen Block, Charters Towers,
averaged £8 17s. from its crushing of 355 tons.
This enabled the directors to declare a 6d. dividend
( £3600). Which is a reminder that there are rich,
little corners left in this lease of nine acres. To
February, 1911, the block produced £424,804. from
87 955 tons, so the cross reef now being worked
above and below the 1450 ft. level is giving better
stone than the average. How long it will last can-
not be told, for a cross reef is more unreliable than
the Brilliant east-and-west formation.
Lancelot, Herberton (Q.), is justifying
itself, and where the German management failed the
Australians are succeeding. Moffat, with the Lance-
lot itself, is breaking fine ore, and getting it in two
shafts. The copper, as the lode was sunk on, got
less, and the tin, from a trace, became stronger.
Now, only a few feet below the German tunnel, there
is 2ft. of solid lode heavily charged with tin. The
Storm Queen is also on high-grade ore. Other Her-
berton district claims are feeling better, partly as
the result of improved milling arrangements, partly
owing to the continued strength of the tin market.
Among recent winners is the Rainbow, which has
come on a fine shoot.
A scheme is being hatched for the amal-
gamation of the two big Cloucurry (Q.) properties,
Mount Elliott and Hampden.
Queensland Government Mining Jour-
nal gets to Mr. John Plummer, of Sydney, who has
written an article on Australian wolfram discoveries
for an American engineering and mining paper.
John P. knows his subject so well that he remarks
that “wolfram and schcelite, the leading tungsten
ores, are mined to some extent in N.S.W., Queens-
land, Tasmania, and the Northern Territory, but the
aggregate output is limited.” The facts are that
Australia is probably easily the greatest, and cer-
tainly one of the greatest, of the world’s producers
of tungsten ores. The United States production of
all tungsten ores for 1909 was worth £111,900, while
the Australian production of wolfram and scheelite
alone was over £86,000. The U.S. returns for 1910
are not available: Australia’s 1910 production of wol-
fram and scheelite was worth £129,500. Queensland
does most of this, its 1910 share being £88,116 ; but
Mr Plummer puts the £88,116 down as £4962, and
the 1909 figures ( £56,438) as £2494. But when
were Freetrade statistics reliable?
* * * *
Mount Bischoff (Tas.) shares have climbed
up to £5O. The November dividend (7s. 6d.) makes
the total paid £l9O per share. The man who buys
at £5O receives 9 p.c. interest very enticing, no
doubt; but it means backing one of the trickiest of
all the metal markets to keep somewhere up near
its present dizzy height.
The Mount Bischoff Extended is the big
Tasmanian mine’s poor neighbor-it used to be
the West before it was rechristened. The hill has
been pretty well rooted, but the present eo. is glean-
ing profitably in the old stopes, while following
shoots into new ground. The high price of tin
helped it last half-year to reduce a debit balance at
Profit and Loss from £4378 to £1451, and, with
a new dressing mill, there may be still better th n,s
ahead if the market keeps good. Unfortunately,
most of the ore is pyritic—some of it very
and that and the fact that the ore has to be hunted
for, put the wonderfullv low costs of the paient
Bischoff out of the question. * #
Arrived last week from Dilah, New Cale-
donia, several Australians who had been engaged
in copper-smelting there. Influential French people
erected a blast furnace, to treat the copper ores from
the Pilou mines. The scheme was a fair-sized one, in "
volving the development of a group of mines, the con-
struction of about six miles of narrow gauge railway,
and the erection of a reduction plant. It failed,
mainly because of bad handling in the construction
stages An English furnace was sent out, with an
Englishman to erect it, and an Englishman to run
it. ” After countless failures the English roetallurgis
left declaring the ore unsmeltable. lhe Irench
people then decided to give the Australian metallur-
gists a chance. Early m the year, Audley Smith
was called down. He took C. G. Rutledge w t im.
In two days the furnace was producing matte, and
Audley Smith quitted and left Rutledge m charge.
By the end of November all the alleged unsmelt-
able ore had been turned into matte and shipped to
Australia, where Port Kembla turned it; into-electro-
lytic copper. There is a section of Pans people who
now have a strong regard for Australian metallurgy.
It saved their scheme from hopeless wreck.
Rutledge, who did the good metallurgical work
at Dilah, is a protege of Audley Smith s. Originally
in the office of the Queensland Government .Analyst,
he drifted to Mount Perry, then to Mount Hector
and Glassford Creek, and finally back to Mount Perry.
There was no great chemical triumph in h;S work at
New clledonia He just simply had to manage the
furnace and the men, and give orders in about four
languages, none of which he understood himself, lo
run a furnace With Kanakas, and some occasional
Japanese, Arabs and Javanese, all of whom thou Skt
Hell had broken loose at the first matte tap, was not
easy. Fresh furnace crews were coming and going
all the time. The Kanaka does not care for boots,
and has no great fondness for even a Join cloth ,
consequently it was not to be expected that he would
stay long at the game of juggling with sparks from
molten metal. Further, he reckoned that the furnace
which required feeding for eight hours all the time,
without letting up on it once to give him a chance
to feed for an hour or two, was a fool of a tmn„
anyhow. * * *
S. Aus. hasn’t many public-service prizes
to give away, but it has just passed one of them to
L. K. Ward, the 32-year-old son of F. W. Ward, of
Sydney Telegraph —the Gentleman with the
Whiskers. Son L. It., who becomes Government
Geologist, in succession to 11. Y. L. Brown, is one of
Professor David’s boys. Quitting Sydney Uni., he
went to the Broken Hill Prop, for experience, then
to Westralia, where he was lecturer in Geology, etc.,
at the Italgoorlie School of Mines, and thence passed on
to Tasmania as Assistant Government Geologist. His
S. Aus. billet is worth £BOO a year. A son of Dr.
R. L. Jack joins him as assistant, vice Basedow.
Mars: Some acountants recognise a differ-
ence between “reserve funds” and “reserves,” and
some don’t. The old idea about the “reserve fund”
was that it had to be represented by special invest-
ments ; nowadays “reserve fund” is applied generally
to profits specially reserved, while “reserves” include
all undivided profits, whether specially reserved or
not. The Bulletin always uses the term “reserves
that way; thus it includes the unappropriated bal-
ance to the credit of profit and loss account. ..,
Sugar Beet: Shares are not quoted, and we don’t
know the co.’s prospects, or whether it has any.
“Will the undertaking pay?” The economical
handling and transport of ores, fluxes, coal, coke,
merchandise, etc., in or about mines, factories or
warehouses, very often solves the problem. W. and
J. Lempriere, of Melbourne, as agents for Bleichert
and Co., can give useful information on this subject.
The Bleichert firm has several aerial ropeway's work-
ing in Australia, or in course of erection, and will
soon have at work,' near Sy'dney/one of the largest
electric “Telpher” plants ,in existence. Special
electric and other cranes and mono-rail convey'ors
can be procured from the same firm;*

The undisputed benefit of asbestos covering for
steam-pipes and boilers has been exemplified by a re-
cent scientific treatise of the principles of steam
conveyance. Tests made have established the fact
that 100 square feet of pipe covered with this
material, at a pressure of 2001 b. per square inch, and
coal at lGs. per ton, will save £7 per year, and
prevent loss of pressure equal to 13.84 B. Th. U. per
square foot per minute. Bell's Asbestos Non-con-

The Bigelow Patent Rock Breaker commends
itseli to mine managers who welcome an effective
machine which is cheaper to maintain and repair
than Gyratory and other crushers. This machine is
of the well-known Blake type, but has some ad-
ditional improvements which have justified in prac-
tice all the claims advanced by the patentee. The
work of crushing is done on the down-stroke of the
pitman instead of the up-stroke; there is no strain
on the pitman cap; two large side rods resist the
thrust of the toggles, and enable the jaws to be
regulated within a large range; the back toggle is
so made as to resist all legitimate strains of crush-
ing, but will shear under exceptional conditions and
save the machine. The shaft and eccentric bearings
are self-lubricating; the jaws are convex and con-
cave, and with the cheek plates are made of steel
and are reversible. The Austral Otis Engineering
Company, of South Melbourne, have installed a great
number of these machines, and hold the sole manu-
facturing rights for the Commonwealth.* [3
Extract from the Saturday Review, January 7,
1911:—“Insurance: A Colonial Mutual Departure.—
Policies combining life or endowment assurance with
other benefits are gradually coming into favor. Their
popularity seems to be justified. Why should one
be compelled to take out two or more policies when
several risks can just as easily be covered under a
single contract ? It was a consideration of this kind that
some short time ago impelled the Board of The Colon-
ial Mutual Life Assurance Society to introduce in
Australasia a combined Life, Accident and Sickness
policy, and as the experiment was attended by a
most welcome increase in New Business, it was
recently decided to extend the issue to the United
Kingdom. There were evidently sound reasons for
the departure. Neither life nor endowment assur-
ance policies afford quite the full protection needed
by most persons, because no provision is made for
accidents or sickness that do not end fatally....
Regarded as a whole, this new policy possesses many
attractions. It is decidedly cheap, and will appeal
to those who cannot afford to disburse large sums
yearly in the form of insurance premiums.”*

For quite a number of years
we have at this Season issued a
set of Calendars, In the past
they have been Copies of Works
of Art, and on this occasion the
Pictures are reproductions of the
following well-known works
"STEALING THE KEYS” - By
Marcus Stone, R.A. (National
Art Gallery, New South Wales).
"VIGEE LE BRUN AND HER
CHILD ” Painted by Herself
(The Louvre, Paris).
"IN DAYS OE OLD”-By F. P.
Mahoney (National Art Gallery,
New S-uth Wales).
Soon we shall be sending sup-
plies to Grocers with their Orders,
and they in their turn will distri-
bute them to their Customers free.
So if you would like a "Robur”
Calendar you had better ask your
Grocer to save you one; they are
daintily got up, and you will be
sure to find the Calendar part
useful to refer to at some time
during the year.
As regards "Robur” Tea itself,
we intend to say nothing, except
that we would like you to buy a
Package and try it in your own
home, in your own way, against
any tea sold at the same money;
and that, for "High-Class” family
every day use, we recommend the

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, December 4, 3911.
My Dear Artnt.—
The limelight flung a flickering glare on
heathen homes between the Niger and the
A lie, in the Town Hall, on Friday evening
Missionary and explorer Dr. Karl Kumm
was the lecturer. In floods of rain, a damn
crowd squelched its individual goloshes
through the well-known rivulet that romps
outside the City Fathers’ tabernacle on wet
nights. Ihe audience began to drip on the
floor quite early in the evening, and, up till
P-m- or so, the human water-shed con-
tinued to trickle into the bulging cataract of
tiie liall. A large area of parsons, armed with
umbrellas, trundled along to hear of black
and eoflee-colored pagans, who still wait at
Borrioboola-Gha, on the left bank of the
Niger, for Mrs. Jellyby and Mr. Quale to
send along the promised pocket-hankies.
Governor Chelmsford and his lady, with
Mayor Allen Taylor and Captain Bolleston,
K.IV, camped on a cosy square of carpet.
Deputy Town Clerk Dayton and the new
rni ’ u -M°l e y ns J occupied the rear-guard.
Ihey heard a lot of interesting news. The
►Sudanese appears to be in a chronic state of
waiting for some other colored pusson to
tread on the tail of his argument, when lie,
1 u , zz y \\ uzzy, joyfully uplifts his arm and
smites the other YVuzzy in his mealie patch,
or any other convenient place.
Explorer Kumm is a large and healthy-
person. He is fairly coherent, but
some ot Ins entlmsisam re the Cross v. Cres-
cent case. (Islam being on the track of Sou-
dan missionary boxes) was rather hard to
follow, perhaps owing to the swamps that
surround I uzzy Wuzzy in his native lair,
ffut the explorer stated firmly and clearly
that the wild elephant is a peevish beast. Six
of that animal, it is alleged, came after
Kumm, and the stout person ran so fast that
he looked like a wild German crack splitting
through the atmosphere. At last, he fell
into a hole, and the elephants, thinking he
was still ahead, rushed past him cursing. I
hate to think of the disappointment of those
animals when they had galloped another 16
miles or so,. and found they were merely
chasing the air. And I would like to be sure
that the speaker didn’t add an elephant or
two * mu would be me f' e ho man nature to do
so. Ihe only time when I was chased by 40
lions (in a dream), I gave way to prevarica-
tion, and added 21 per cent., thereby making
41 lions. I have also an impression that the
elephants might have some excuse for their
conduct. If I was an undressed and blushing-
elephant, and was quietly teai-ing up trees in
my bedroom, with my nose—possibly on a
fresh spring morning—I would hate to have
a big, interfering German burst in on me and
upset the washstand with his large, clumsy
Major Quilter, the towering guardsman,
i 2.- came here on Lord Denman’s
stall, has fled back to England. He
received the news, a few weeks ago, of his
father’s death, and has gone back on busi-
ness connected with the family estate. The
, ederal Exes, and their retainers are said to
be desolated over the affair. The sky-scraping
Major was popular everywhere, and
he was the moving genius of the newly-
formed polo team. He has promised to re-
turn, but there are doubts and fears that,
when he gets to the other side, he may
change his mind and stop there.
The new rule at State Government House,
which requests all comers to hand over their
names —no responsibility taken about break-
izz transit on caidboard, is a l’evival
of the plain and simple Kawson methods. It
takes a short cut to the Intelligence Depart-
ment of the Uniform in Waiting, and relieves
the mental strain of both combatants—the
Caller-out and the Called. Gov. Chelms-
ford’s. garden party, which occurred some-
where in the archives of late November, was
the cause of this handy application of ink on
pasteboard.
The rain—the same useful, wet, old rain
which is good for dairy herds and bad for
cricket—fell down suddenly on Gov. Chelms-
ford’s afternoon assembly at Cranbrook, with
some damage to its size. Those who rallied
round the indoor sandwich —the new and
handsome ballroom was the chief port of
call —made determined efforts to inspect the
imported baby, Margaret Sydney Thesiger,
who is alleged to have been seen at frequent
intervals by those who looked in the right
place. Those who craned their necks “to
peer up at a balcony, and stamped round the
wet grass in search of little Margaret Syd-
ney, got nothing for their pains.
Mayor Allen Taylor’s dinner to the re-
cently returned Gov. Chelmsford had a fore-
runner much appreciated by the unlucky,
who generally sit cheek-by-jowl, at these
banquets, with their best-hated enemies.
The circular went before to make straight
the way of the invited feeder. He was
cautioned about the number of guests each
table would hold (six), then warned to
gather together those five invited souls most
congenial to himself, and he had the option
(n.v.) to smite any intruder on his peaceful
browse. By using language to the tele-
phone for some days before the feast, 130
male persons were able to run to earth the
mates they wanted for each Six Souls’ cor-
roboree.
Mrs. J. M. A. Bonthorne, of Trevenna,
Darling Point, is on the wing for Swiss sky-
scraping winter resorts, and leaves in the
Mongolia on December 16. After a whiff of
Marseilles, the wanderer will rush through
to Paris, and join her sister, Miss Bud Neill
(also of this side). They will then set forth
to assault the Alps with skates and alpen-
stocks. Mrs. Bonthorne is a confirmed skater,
and mnv bring back from the Matterhorn
and other chamois-leather peaks some new
and reliable method of skimming the Sydney
Glaciarium patch next winter, at a 70-miles
an hour speed limit.
Included in the summer exodus to the Blue
Mountains are many city and suburban
tribes. They are already polishing up the
family billy, which the head of each tribe
will be expected to carry, in addition to large
stores of fodder, while junior members of
the sept clamber over the wet face of water-
falls, etc. Mr. and Mrs. E. C. V. Broughton
are at present dragging at their Manly moor-
ings, as a preliminary to scaling Leura’s
golf-linked heights.
Mrs. Steer Bowker and her daughters
Gladys and Marjorie, and blue eyed Barbara,
are off to the Apple Island for two months
or so, about the time the opera stamps the
earth in Pitt-street.
The Rose Bay golf ground recently wore a
large tent, like the cone of a white volcano,
on its front terrace. The reason was a mild
epidemic of tea and muffin corroborees. Soci-
ety and others have been assiduously tea-
fighting each other at the golf links, prepara-
tory to tearing themselves asunder for the
Christmas flight. Owing to a large supply of
sea breeze, the tarpaulin’s excrescence began
to show signs of distress before it was laid to
rest. Clarissa, who is addicted to golf, tells
me that the Pekoe party given by Mrs. W.
11. Rothe, under the golf lawn tent, knocked
adjacent china revels at Rose Bay into mere
mandarin pips.
After a tour of the Block, with its endless
trail of vacant women and simpering flap-
pers, it revives one’s hopes for the future of
the nation to hear from Prof. Gilruth of the
type of Australian womanhood he met in the
Northern Territory, on his recent visit there
for the Commonwealth Government. Away
up by the Roper River, his party came across
a solitary white woman in charge of a sta-
tion, the owner of which, her husband, had gone
“overlanding” cattle. Her paper-bark house
was scrupulously clean, her hospitality as
modest as it was generous, and her household
methods unaffected.by the great distance
from so-called civilisation. She exercised
full control over the blacks who manned the
station, and shortly before the Gilruth party
arrived had had no hesitation in leading a
force of tame Binghi against a tribe of wild
blacks who had been spearing her cattle.
When she returned, she brought a few of the
marauders with her, and, later, handed them
over to the troopers as a warning. Muster-
ing with the aid of black brother was her fre-
quent occupation, and camping out at night
she regarded as a mere circumstance. With
the professor’s outfit, she travelled some dis-
tance in pursuit of straying cattle, “and,”
said he, “it was with genuine regret that we
saw the brave woman ride back to her soli-
tude.” . Now, what would happen on the
Block, if even one wild Binghi suddenly ap-
peared and waved his spear? Can you imag-
ine the rush for Sargent’s fortress !
Prof. Anderson Stuart and Mrs. Stuart
left by the Moldavia on Saturday, for
Europe’s ancient shores. Any foreign bacilli
or strange germs that stay out late are liable
to be potted by the Sydney Uni.’s Man of
Medicine, for rigorous cross-examination on
his return hither.
Mrs. Philip Morton and her two elder
daughters also departed in the out-going
Moldavia. The Morton infant, Rachel Joy,
will cut her teeth on diamond pendants or
other useful toys, in her native land, being
too young to nibble ship biscuits on the
heaving main. In the same barque went,
also, the tuneful Castles sisters, Amy and
Dolly, to lift up their voices once more amid
the baronial halls of the Old World.
The Spencer Bruntons, of this township,
are arranging for their exit during the first
week in January. Twelve months or so will
be their allotted span for a canter over
Europe s war-worn countenance.
As I write, the N.S.W. Institute of
Architects is in the act of being officially
torn open. The occasion is an exhibition of
drawings relating to the art of building that
house which nobody seems able to get these
days._ If shows of this kind encourage the
budding architect to expand his ideas on the
acute subject of pantries, linen-cupboards,
shade verandahs, etc., the Australian woman
who dwells in the small suburban villa will
have less ferocious views of the ultimate des-
tination of local house designers.
In the larger piles of brick and mortar
round about Sydney, the bricks are care-
fully gummed together, otherwise there
might arise a riot of domestic helps, who
would hurl these missiles at any architect
on sight (hoping to catch the offender who
designed an undersized kennel for their
sleeping apartment). I looked at the plan of
a two-storeyed palace the other day. It was
up to date in the matter of flamboyant
trimmings, narrow window streaks, pigeon-
house gables, and Elizabethan chimneys.
Various extra-large reception rooms, a pan-
try rather bigger than a coffin and just as
well ventilated, and a servants’ room 9ft. by
Bft. were its primary features. The pros-
pective handmaidens, possibly three, will
have to do advance booking, for one of the
trio, in the adjacent coal-shed. The Insti-
tute might demonstrate some of these curiosi-
ties. and explain why it is that most “ris-
ing architects, in these parts, design air-
tight Tudor dwellings that ought to be
dropped into the middle of a British blizzard.
The vast homestead on the George Vivers’
slieepwalk, up Glen Innes way, will roof
some Christmas gaiety this year. Mrs
George is going to flit from her flat in
Macquarie-street, somewhere in the middle of
this month to the King’s Plains mansion,
which is able to tuck in about 30 able-bodied
invaders, without getting short-winded in its
space measurement.
It rained with enthusiasm on the Bishops-
court parsons party the other afternoon,
llie wicket being under water, those bidden
to the fray are reported to have risen to the
surface to breathe indoors. Bishopscourt
used to be Greenoaks, so its floor acreage is
a solid proposition. Estella, who was one of
the bidden, says Archbishop Wright pro-
pelled some polite remarks at the new Moore
College headpiece—Parson Davies—who
caught them with both hands. The Davies
leply, the black-coat party having been
hauled together in his honor, was less pro-
pßious. There was a faint suggestion of the
call ot the collection-box about Davies “I
hope you will support the work of the
Church at Moore College,” and Estella in-
stinctively felt for a threepenny bit.
Miss Florence Fox, who shakes her pen
on local newspapers, is about to enter into
tlie bonds of matrimony with Mr. Benson,
who hails from Bulli’s fern-tree gorges, or
theieabouts. The honeymoon will be spent
m the Cabbage Patch. To speed the depart-
mg b lorence, some of this city’s women jour-
nalists will gather together in one place, be-
fore this meets your eye. Mrs. Baverstock’s
latch will be on the click (up Woolwich
way) for the event Light refreshments
will support all hands, and the gentle girl
will get away with a purse of sovereigns.
.Yet another member of the Union Club
will shortly wed a lady of the musical
comedy persuasion. He is young, and a
member of a well-known pastoral-cum-mili-
tary family. She is also young, likewise
large and beautiful, but not otherwise widely
known to fame.
The Titheradge matinee, on a warm after-
noon last week, dragged before the foot-
lights two accomplished actors, widely apart
in their stage mechanism, but alike' in the
bnlhant finish of their work—Tith. himself
and the .veteran George Rignold. Himself,’
Iff Yf Unn / al * < ; ( L lere in own specialty—-
effect and subtle suggestion, often conveyed
without more exertion than the flicker of’an
eyelash was the lion who roared like a
gentlemanly turtle dove over the emotions of
Lady Carl yon (Mrs. T. 11. Kelly), in the
playlet In Honor Bound.”
Ethel Irving has the same genius for sug-
gesting a divorce, a reconciliation, and three
volumes of comment, in half a smile, which
Tith. put into his K.C. part in Sydney
Grundy s breezy sketch. Ethel Irving
also kills the average actor, who squirms
after her cues.
, H - Kelly, as Lady Carlyon,
woimed her way across the stage in an eel-
skin glitter, and was rewarded for her ardu-
ous efforts by a large supply of vegetable
matter from her friends. Pretty Lily Tith-
eradge ( Knowles) tried to act up to
mi father, but Tith. flattened out both ladies
present with loud applause.
“Hop’s” original drawing for the Tith
matinee programme, was bought by Mr!
Leonard Dodds for 10 guineas, which was
promptly dropped amid the £4OO or so
gathered up in coin of the realm at the seats
ot the money changers, and the sign of Her
Majesty s Theatre.
Ola Jane Humphrey, speaking to a Fog
Town press minion, anent the subject of her
pnncely husband stated : “He treated me as
TiJ J ere .- one . of . th ? ladies M a harem.”
The Egyptian insisted upon complete obedi-
ence from his wife, and even subjected her to
personal violence. Said Ola:
I found that he regarded me no more than as if T
were a servant. He ordered me about. I was not
allowed to see my friends or even to receive letters
For one month I was practically a prisoner. On one
occasion he asked me to wait for him in the foyer of
the hotel. I waited three , hours, and then went to
my bedroom. Later the Prince came up, very angry
and told me I must obey his orders. “You are the
only person in the whole world,” he exclaimed, “who
has dared to combat my will for an instant ” Yes
my marriage was a great mistake.
No wonder that the decorative mummeress
found his Royal Duskiness an uncomfort-
able person to live with.
The domestic instincts of the small girl
rrom the audience who innocently aided and
abetted the Wizard Nicpla in the hat-e<><>-
farm business at the Palace, on Saturday
night, caused chortles of delight from staid
matrons. The mite, with her fair hair
smoothed down in Madonna bands on a
large and placid forehead, got a good
motherly grip of one of Nicola’s numerous
eggs.. Is that a good one?” asked the man
ot tricks. A soft smile illuminated the in-
fant s face as she gently shook the egg to
feel its weight. It icas a good egg. The boy,
also, lured from the stalls, put a bird’s-nest-
ing intelligence to his first Nicola egg. “It’s
all right, isn tit ? Whei’jat the boy put his
mouth to the business end--the end the small
boy introduces to grandmother when he
teaches the old lady to suck eggs. “It is all
right, said the merry Nick, hurriedly remov-
mg the cause.
Singer Zara Wolinski and her artist
brother, Joe Wolinski, slip off Australia this
week for the Dominion of Baronet Ward
Their objective is Auckland, and their main
theme will be to sing tuneful lays at the
musical festival in that water-washed city.
The festival is a large and cheerful song of
thanksgiving for the new Town Hall, which
exceeds all other town halls in Australasia
in the number of inhabitants it can wedge
into its interior. Henry Brett, of the Auck-
land Stab, has given a £lO,OOO organ to the
Great Municipal Event, which will open
with glad, noises and the sound of a great
wind tearing through its organ pipes.
Tenor John McCormack is going to make
a lightning dart for Adelaide, after the opera
season here. He will strike the Saintly
City on or about December 26, get his
breath, and tune up his top register for a
concert on December 27. Rosina Buck-
man (she began life in New Plymouth,
Maoriland, not that that has anything to do
with the case) will be one of the McCor-
mack concert co., and Kaufmann will be an-
other warbler. (New Plymouth, some years
ago, as a place of disembarkation on a
rough night, had a wave-beaten pier, off
which it was more convenient to topple into
the inky darkness than to feel for one’s
luggage and not topple off the. edge, of
M.L. Not that that has anything to do
with the case, either.)
A man, who recently toured Burmah, tells
me the Burmese maiden is amazingly attrac-
tive in her holiday war-paint. “It’s a scar-
let hibiscus under one ear—and you can’t
imagine, the effect.” Pressed to give details,
he admitted that the lady he admired was
also clad in a short, shot-silk skirt (say
that rapidly eight times before breakfast)
and a small, white bolero, and showed her
teeth under the gold shade of a light, native
umbrella, in that delectable tint. “Why
don t Australian girls, up north, turn out in
cool rig of that kind, instead of hanging on
to starched collars, and all the heavy-weight
gear of cold-climate women?” asks this male
person from coffee-colored parts. I don’t
know why, unless it’s because one type of
woman would cling to her linen neck-fence
and tailor-built shell, in the middle of the
Great Conflagration down under.
Yours by the glad sea waves,
VANDORTAN.

“GENTLEMAN JACK.”
By DON DELANEY. Illustrated. Price 1/-, Post Free 1/t.
Bushranging for revenge, not for profit, is the keynote of “Gentleman Jack,” and those who
are in search of startling episodes and splendid situations should peruse tins veritable roraa
of bushranging. “Dr. Jekyl. and Mr. Hyde” is not one whit more remarkable than this tale of
the man who is bushranger and lover by turns, and who creates that air of mystery throughout
that is so dear to the reader’s heart. , .... ... . . „„„ Wqll
Altogether a rattling story, apart from the fact that the doings of the notorious Ben Hall
gang are woven in with the main plot, and lend it a keen note of tragedy.

“Outback” is an unknown country to thousands of Australians, and on that account possesses
a charm that is all its own Very few of our writers, have given faithful accounts of things as
they are out there * some are all gloom, others all caricature; but in Sumner Locke we have an
author who strikes'a happy medium with the happiest results. “Mum Dawson is a pen picture
worthy ofDickens; drawnf seemingly, without effort, so natural is it and illumined with bright
splashes of humor which are inimitable. It is safe to predict that this new author will have
vogue that will rival, if not outrival, any of the present-day Australian writers.

Mr Pratt, who has presented the story so convincingly that, for tense interest and exciting reading,

Is tHe Ideal Home Piano.
What the Pianola Piano will mean in your home: —
It will mean that you can have music—the best of music— whenever you want
lt- It will mean that you will always have an ever-ready means of entertaining
friends.
It will mean a constantly growing familiarity with an abundance of beautiful
music you may not at present even realise is in existence.
It will mean an important educational factor for the children a method of
making them familiar with the world’s great composers, thus supplying a deficiency
in the educational system of most schools.
It will mean that you can familiarise yourself with the grand operas that are
to be sung this season by Madame Melba’s Grand Opera Co., in advance of their
production or it will keep you in touch with the successes of the comic-opera stage.
And above all it will mean that, instead of just listening to music, you can play it
No one can tell you the tremendous fascination of producing music. You must
experience it yourself. And, when you do, you will realise for the first time in your
life you are learning what musical enjoyment is. The STECK Pianola Piano,
having a Pianola inside its case, may be played by anyone. The presence of the
Pianola, however, does not interfere with the piano’s use for hand playing and
practice.
IMPORTANT. —If you have reached the point where music in the home seems
essential to the happiness of the family, do not make the mistake of supposing that
there are other instruments just about as good as the PIANOLA PIANO.
Only at Pianola Hall can you obtain the PIANOLA and STECK or STEIN-
WAY PIANOLA PIANOS.
Other firms have other players, for which extravagant claims are made, but the
PIANOLA continues everywhere to be regarded as the STANDARD. _ It is the
only instrument of the kind which has the hearty support of the musical world,
and which is bought by the most discriminating class of purchasers here and abroad.
Let us send you one of our catalogues. We will send it free if you will write us. Ask

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, December 4, 1911.
My Dear Yarrie, —
On Tuesday, some time after the flight of
this screed pressward, the State Parliament
will burst open, and the ladies’ galleries will
be filled to suffocation with bad-tempered
women in good clothes. (They always crowd
the dull runction, though it be nothing more
than the ceremonious opening of a weary
Premier’s rest cure.)
G.-G. Denman invaded the Victorian Ar-
tists show, in the upper room of the Athen-
aeum, and carried off two pictures, “Pioneers
ot the Australian Fleet,” by Burgess, and
Mathers “Central Railway Station.” The
marine burgess, by the way, is the son of an
old Ma State naval officer.
The other day, State Excellency Fuller, as
one of a nicely flannelled team, played cricket
against the Bar, on the Warehousemen’s (or
Albert) Ground. Captain Nutting and Dick
Nevill were included in the white-clad group.
Donald McKinnon, with his silver hair wav-
ing in the sunlight, lost a pound or so of
weight in captaining the legal team. Guy
Madden was in good form, and rushed up a
score of 34, while Captain Crespin knocked
together 61 for the six-and-eightpenny divi-
sion. A handful of smartly-dressed women
patted beautifully-gloved hands at intervals,
and poured tea for the heroes. Melba, in a
white lingerie dress, motored along for a
peep; and other songsters of the co. watched
the solemn game with some interest.
Gentleman Help Stewart-Richardson had
a birthday last week, and two male friends
gave a dinner and a supper in his honor.
However, the Highlander found, at the last
minute or thereabout, that he would have to
be on duty. So his chair was removed and
the party regretfully celebrated without him.
According to the American papers, Hol-
man James, the Victorian who shot big
game with Roosevelt, has been buying up the
globe in instalments. He already owns a
vast stretch, of country in South Africa,
which he utilises for flax growing. Lately,
various bits of Canada have been falling
into his possession. After the Boer scramble,
in which he upheld the Empire, James made
a pile by crocking his Australian stockwhip
the U.S., as “Fred Lindsay, the
Whip King.” He is a brother of AVinifred
James, novelist and journalist, and a cousin
ot Major James of this city.
Anna Brennan, who is Melbourne’s Portia,
got into the legal limelight for the first time
last week, when she instructed her brother
lorn. many girls instruct their bro-
thers, but they don’t all do it on this basis.
. Bunny is painting a portrait of Dr. Leeper,
in the scarlet robes he wears as AVarden of
the University. The picture is to be ex-
hibited next year at the Amsterdam Inter-
national show.
iwß> r^ Helen Sexton is setting out early in
1912 for a foreign holiday. After that, so
she asserts, she will give up work for recrea-
tion. The busy woman made some resolu-

As soon as the Landale-Clarke wedding is
over, the AV. J. T. Clarkes are to migrate
to Mount Schank, the South Australian sta-
tion which was settled upon AV.J.T.C. by the
late Joseph of the clan. The house, purchased
from the Jack AVallaces by the family, is to
be altered extensively.
The stepdaughter of Parson Mackie was
married unobtrusively, last week, to one of
the Blacks, of Tarwin. Mrs. Mackie subse-
quently gave an “At Home” at Menzies’.
Mrs. Mayoress Embling, of Prahran, is a
Mackie daughter.
Some time before Christmas, Mabel Krone
will be made a Mason by marriage with
Charles, son of the late Speaker Mason.
The ceremony is to happen on a Friday, at
the Arthur Hassells’ place, in Toorak.
From the Australian group in London
comes news of the engagement of Maisie,
daughter of the wealthy absentee Squatter
Richmond, of N.S.W., to Gordon, the soldier
son of Banker Finlayson, one time of Vic-
toria. The Richmonds, until recently, rented
a Scottish castle with a weird name. When a
new owner gave them notice, they unwil-
pngly moved to a mere house. Both the
Finlaysons and Richmonds were Toorakians
in years gone by.
We have had three consuls from China
Within a few moons. The present official
and his wife are highly Americanised, and
form a striking contrast to the previous re-
presentative, who looked as if he had been
abducted from a story book. He could not
speak a word of English, and depended
wholly on a thin little pencil of a secretary
He did not bring his story-book wife with
him, but was accompanied by a small, amber-
tinted son. The first of the trio was a
learned gentleman with an almond-eyed
beauty of a wife. She resembled a piece of
tinted porcelain, and had the thoughtful re-
pose of a sugar basin ; also, she dressed gor-
geously in the Chinese fashion. Her lord
established her in a shabby genteel house
down Carlton way, with one or two bits of
carved Chow furniture amongst the horse-
hair chairs, glass-covered wax flowers and
antimacassars.
Some prospecting enthusiast has been rub-
brown dust off the Gothic columns
ot Change, and has discovered that the hard
substance underneath is pink and grey
veined marble. Probably a general clean up
will happen soon, in order to make the
brokers tall building a better match for its
new neighbor. The neighbor, or brother, or
adjacent cicumstance, is the new office
ot the Queensland National Bank, now com-
ing south for the first time, with
its crocodile under its arm and its mangrove
in its hair. The Queensland National Bank
is a huge circumstance up North, and the
North is growing'fast. The Melbourne Gal-
lery, with a wad of the Felton Bequest
money, lately acquired Ambrose Patterson’s
picture of Collins-street, which shows the
exchange region.
May Vale Gilfillian showed her friends
some recently-completed work in her studio
last week. It includes a fine miniature of
one ot the Brighton Gibson girls, dressed in
her grandmother’s brocaded gown. Also
there are enamels and stone settings. The
miniatures are surrounded by precious
names. One of them is set in a circle of
dull copper, studded with black opals. In
the studio, an old portrait of David Syme
came to light. May was once allowed to
plank her camp stool in a corner of the Col-
lins-street office and sketch the subject as he
toiled, the result was a fine bit of strong,
rough work Syme, grizzly-grey, with square
jaw, and tight-shut mouth, is shown ponder-
ing over his daily job, which may be briefly
summed up as Victoria.
The Greens’ ball, which is to happen on
December 9, is to be a glittering affair with
a fancy-dress pageant, a minuet and a flower
cotillon. The dancing offspring of Society
will see the frivol through, and then make a
dash tor the sunny beaches.
Big efforts are. being made to raise funds
tor a permanent convalescent home for the
blind, at Brighton, and a number of women
have undertaken to try and wring one shil-
ling from every house. House-to-house col-
lecting for charity isn’t all tea and gossip,
it takes a good stock of genuine svmpathv
and nerve to meet the hard, suspicious look
ot a housemaid tnrough the meshes of a wire
door, originally designed to keep out flies,
but very useful in keeping other pests at
bay. A collectress I know puts it this way:
Having glanced at your card, Marianne
says coldly, I 11 see, and leaves you standing
on the mat. You know you are making a
nuisance of yourself, and are pretty sure the
gill thinks you have taken on the unpleasant
job in. order to inspect all the drawing-
rooms in the street. You imagine the snappy
conversation between the Marv and the
mistress, and wince; also, you feel like an
ass. When the shilling is thrust at you, you
are abjectly grateful. The girl is merely
anxious to shut the door and get rid of you
Kepeat the process 30 or 40 times in rapid
succession, throw in a few curt refusals by
way of variety, and you feel like a bailiff or
female bushranger.”
y° ut >? woman who missed her last train
to me distant seaside suburb where her
family resides, found herself alone in the city
with ss. a ridiculously inadequate sum for
travelling expenses after 12 p.m. However
she advanced boldly on a cabman, and or-
cleied him, for a very moderate amount, to
diive her several miles on her way. Deaving
that cab and its morose chauffeur at a dark
railway station, the intrepid young person
. another wheeled sarcophagus,
and hired it for a few more miles. (< I got
home at last,” she chuckles. “But don’t ask
me what time it was! You see, if I had
taken the same cab all the way home, good-
ness knows what it would have cost!” The
two or three cab system seems to be built
round the idea that the late cab hirer has to
pay more for taking the homesick cabman far
away from his base than for the actual horse
perspiration used.
Blamire Young opened a one-man show in
the upper regions of the Athenaeum, on Sat-
urday. _ Before _ the day was through, a
gratifying financial epidemic broke out. (He
iecently finished a show in Adelaide, which
brought out the cheque books, and made
them rustle like the leaves when the south
wind stirs.) One of the pictures is called
A Dream of Old Sydney.” Another is of
Circular Quay, as seen from a big height—a
gold semi-circle speckled thickly with small
black, ant-like figures.
On Saturday night, Melba, as Desdemona,..
put a sparkle into Society’s eye, and made it

G.-G. Denman, with a stiff arm and all his

and a dress of grey and white tulle. Captain

night, at the Masonic Hall, in a beautiful

From my Adelaide correspondent:—■=•
G eorg e Turnbull has just died in Westralia. He
was one of the numerous Bagot clan, and was weU
known in S. Australia. His wife is a daughter of
'wr Patterson vyho for many years administered
the North Terrace Lunatic Asylum.
Affluence is fleeing from this city like unto a
Manchu pursued by 75 Chinese of the Lower Orders.
Country boarding-houses and hotels are booking rooms
as quickly as they can answer their telephones, and
tnose who own “summer residences” are filling them
m haste. Government House—so far as its feminine
inhabitants go—is deserted; they’ve established
themselves at Marble Hill. The Governor hangs on—
presumably for reasons of State—and puts up a
dogged bluff at feeling cool; but it deceives no one.
Ihe aides are frankly sweltering.
Talking of Empire-welders, Mayor Cohen —qua
Mayor—has ceased to exist. The rabbits’: fur has
fallen upon the collar-bone of Alderman Bonython,
Who acted successfully as locum tenens during l Mr.
Cohen s recent hunt for a Lord Mayoralty or Grail or
whatever it was. The ex-Mayor’s career has been of
the meteoric sort. He has either filled the very
heavens with a blaze of splendor, or lain hidden be-
neath a bushel or similar light-extinguishing con-
trivance.
The Lyric Club sang a sort of swan song (in fact,
several of them) on Wednesday; and that, despite
such heat as is rarely experienced this side of the
graye, Mrs. Von Truer, Miss Zoe Reid and Miss
Dorothea Jacob carolled blithely, aided by Mr. Von
Truer and Mr. Arthur Smith. The club’s lease ex-
pires shortly, and the committee has search-parties
out, questing desperately through the dense jungles
of our Land Boom for house-room.
By the way, the Queen Adelaide Club is doing like-
wise. The membership list has swollen, so that the
Queen Adelaide must either find a new dub-house or
burst the one it at present inhabits.
The summer racing season opened at Morphettville
with a cheery Tattersall’s meeting. Deacon Skinner’s
Win was a surprise (tp the riders of'the second and

porters £l5 12s. Dr. A. H. Bennett captured Tat-
tersall’s Purse with Wheat King, who paid a divi-
dend of £l3 12s.
Mrs. W. Milne returned to Adelaide from Sydney
the other day, absorbed four breaths of super-heated
atmosphere,, and fled straight to her house at Mount

panied her.
Barbara, youngest daughter of Mr. L. A. Jessop, of

The Bach Society took the Town Hall on Tuesday
night, and classical music rattjed the windows, which

“Kodak”: The constable was very new and
nervous, and the man wore a frock-coat,
gold-rimmed spectacles and an air of au-
thority. The fact that his speech was a bit
thick didn’t matter —any gentleman was en-
titled to be that way at 12 p. m . “Come on,

The Commonwealth lately blew out the
foolish State boundaries, as far as defence
is concerned, the idea being the common-
sense one of defining the military districts
according to their natural positions for the
purposesof training; mobilisation, etc. Thefirst
district is now Queensland, and the N.S.W.
towns of Casino, Lismore and Grafton. No
district comprises part of N.S.W. and a bit
or Victoria. No. 3 is composed of a bit of
Victoria and part of N.S.W., and No 4 is
made up of S.A„ and a slice of the Mu State,

Brass Button” : When the Kosmos liner
Sesostris walked up high and dry on the
beach of Guatemala a few weeks ago, it took
a new start in life. It retired to the country
near the town of Ocos, and the Ocussers
gathered round and decided that, though they
had no use for the ruin regarded as a ship,
they could employ it as a town hall or a
tobacco tactory, or anything else to which
it could settle down on even keel. So
they got the engines going, and set them
churning out an electric light supply for
Ocos. Now the Ocussing city fathers think
ot using the propeller - municipal chaff-
cutter or safety razor, and of fitting up the
bridge deck as a bar, and the main hold as
me speaker s private room, having first taken
P recau tion to hook the anchors firmly in
the borough back yard. So far, the look,
out, a tramway conductor, reports that the
light is burning brightly and all’s well.

NO MORE BULKY FIGURES.
To have a clumsy, fat figure is quite inex-
cusable nowadays. The i-emedy for over-
fatness is now within the purchasing power
of the slender purse. That remedy is an off-
shoot or, rather, a concentration of the
famous Marmola Prescription, and is called
Marmola Prescription Tablets. The popu-
larity of these dainty tablets is increasing by
leaps and bounds, because those who take
them are pleased to introduce to their stout-
friends a reliable remedy in so pleasing a
form. Marmola Prescription Tablets, which
are taken singly—one after each meal and
one at bedtime —are capable of taking off
several pounds of fat in a single week. So
easy and pleasant is the decrease effected
that there is an actual physical sense of get-
ting slenderer, and, at the- same time, better
in health, and muscuiarly stronger, while the
nervous System is also reinvigorated. The
superfluous fat about the face, neck and
shoulders falls away, leaving the contours
pure and the skin clearer and smoother.
Appetite and digestion are greatly -stimu-
lated. Marmola Prescription Tablets are
sold by chemists, price 3/6, or, post free, of
the Marmola Company, 5 & 7 Barrack
Street, Sydney, N.S.W.*
Note —For those who prefer the liquid pre-
paration, chemists are still dispensing the
famous prescription as follows: —One ounce
of fluid Extract of Ohjcyrrhiza B.P., one
ounce of pure Glycerine B.P., one half-
ounce of Marmola, and mix with peppermint
water to make six ounces in all. The dose
is tivo teaspoonfuls after each meal.

A RHEUMATIC
CRIPPLE
♦
Tells How He Banished
Suffering and Pain*
Could just drag along —Cured by
Dr* Williams’ Pink Pills*
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are recom-
mended to Rheumatic sufferers with confi-
dence because they have cured hundreds of
cases of Rheumatism. That is the greatest
test any medicine can have—the ability to
cure. Mr. C. Shanahan, bootmaker, of 07
Buckingham Street, North Richmond, Mel-
bourne, was so badly attacked by Rheuma-
tism that often he could hardly drag one
foot after the other, and the weight of the
bed clothes was sometimes agonising to his
aching muscles and joints. Mr. Shanahan’s
story, given in his own words, will be of
interest to anyone suffering with Rheuma-
tism.
“I could not make it out at first,” he said,
“but I noticed severe muscular pains coming
into my legs from the feet to the knees. I
got worse attacks as time went on. The
attacks might go away for a week or so or
appear for a few days, but once I was laid
up for five weeks in bed most of the time,
and unable to go out, and then I was at-
tacked in arms and shoulders as well. I
was always freer from the pain in winter,
but I dreaded the summer, for I always suf-
fered then. The perspiration would run off
me with the pain. I felt every change in
the weather. There was no sign externally,
but the muscles of the legs would feel as if
they were being all drawn up and twisted.
I was always having the parts rubbed with
liniments, but I could not find any relief. I
could not bear any heavy bed clothes, the
parts were so sore and tender, and the
warmth always made me feel worse. I
would lie awake afraid to move. I was
afraid for anyone to come near me. When
the attacks were on me I dreaded the least
touch. My legs were so stiffened that walk-
ing was most painful. I would just drag
my feet after me, and I dare not put them
on any cold surface. I might feel quite
well one moment, and perhaps the slightest
change of weather would bring on an at-
tack. I would have to get up and walk
about if I had been resting awhile, and
again if I had been walking home very tired
I would have to go and lie down. I am
glad to say that a course of Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills took the complaint right away.
I am only too glad to give this testimonial
to help any other sufferer. This remedy
cured me, and I have not had any sign of the
Rheumatism since. My limbs are as supple
as could be wished.”

Pink Pills cure. Don’t be gulled into taking
something said to be just as good. Of all

POLITICAL
POINTS
Federal Meteorologist Hunt has explained
that it-isn’t a special run of good seasons
which is causing the present unprecedented
prosperity, for the rainfall since 1902 has
actually been a little below the average. And
gold isn’t the cause, for the gold output has
dropped by nearly £5,000,000 a year since
1903. So we are driven to the assumption
that Federation and Protection are chiefly
responsible.
The N.S.W. Government will not soon
forget the revolt of its supporter, McGarry,
member for Murrumbidgee. The cork flew
out of McGarry’s patience all of a sudden,
and he rose and spoke frankly about the
Government’s treatment of his district. He
didn’t exactly say that the Ministry was
unfit to sweep out a lunatic asylum, but his
attitude seemed .vaguely to suggest that some
of its ancestors were no deader than they
deserved, and that it took after them. What
with Dunn, Horne, Nielsen and now
McGarry, revolt is growing rather frequent.
It is a solemn commentary upon the end-
lessness of things that the N.S.W. Public
Works Committee should now be asked to
consider, and take evidence upon, and report
concerning (1) a bridge to connect Sydney
with North. Shore; or (2) a tunnel; or, al-
ternatively, (3) a State-owned ferry. Every
one knoivs that the bridge was an urgent
matter 40 years ago, and that the traffic has
increased so much that there is now business
enough for a bridge and two tunnels ; that the
harbor is already too full of ferry boats, and
that the ferry is an antiquated business,
anyhow. The idea of starting now to con-
sider the whole business over again is like
holding an inquest on Noah.
A fleeting jest of last week was the state-
ment of Sydney Telegraph that the Naval
College should not be on Federal territory at
Jervis Bay (87 miles from Sydney), but at
Put Hacking (about a dozen miles from
Sydney), because “the healthiness of the
site [Jervis Bay] is open to question.” It
is really a pity that the Telegraph didn't
discover this alleged unhealthiness in the
days when it was clamoring for Jervis Bay
(instead of Twofold Bay) as the ideal sea
outlet for the Federal capital. Apparently,
the position is this : (1) Jervis Bay is the
very nearest point to Sydney that can legally
be selected for the Federal port under clause
325 of the Constitution (and even it strains
clause 125 pretty hard). Therefore, re-
garded as a Federal port, it is splendidly
healthy. (2) Jervis Bay isn’t the nearest
possible point to Sydney for a naval college,
therefore when that subject turns up it is
darkly suspected of being a pestilential spot.
“Henry Horsecollar” protests :
Several people have suggested in the House of
Representatives that the States should be allowed to
be part-owners of the Commonwealth Bank. The
idea is excellent, but does it go far enough? I
think the public should have an interest in the
concern. Also, the nation should be considered, and
some shares should be reserved, to- be held in the
name of the community. And whkt have the people
done that they shouldn’t be part-owners of the in-
stitution, also the population, likewise the inhabi-
tants, and the citizens, and folk generally, and the
electors, and the men and women of Australia. The
Commonwealth proposes that 'everybody should have
a share in the bank, as an inhabitant of Australia.
I think everybody should have 10 shares: (1) As
an inhabitant of Australia ; (2) as an inhabitant of
his State; (3) as a resident of his town, district, or
whatnot; (4) as a worker (or loafer as the case may
be) ; (£>) as a citizen; (6) as a taxpayer or possible
taxpayer; (7 to 10) as a bloke, patriot, Australian
and member of the community. I hate this Federal
tyranny. Also, I don’t believe in one-adult-one-vote.
1 think every adult should have 73 votes.

The great idea of granting a bonus on
exported “tops”(partly manufactured wool),
but only on the exported article, so as to
supply the foreign cloth manufacturer with
cheaper material than our own manufacturer
can get, is booming. Last week it was re-
ported that a single Botany (N.S.W.) firm
had an order for 1,000,0001 b. of tops for
Japan alone. Yet, in 3909 (the last year
covered by Knibbs’s statistics) all the wool
used in N.S.W. factories represented only
about 3.000,0001 b. In 1909 the factories of
the six States used 1,050,0001 b. less wool than
in 1908. But the manufacture of “tops” for
cheap export under the bonus system, estab-
lished for the encouragement of foreign fac-
tories, was 15 times greater in 1909 than in
1908
NASAL MUTILATON TO VEX THE

It is only proposed to remedy a few anomalies in
the tariff. The general revision is postponed.
AUSTRALIA: “Say, Alister, these foreigners
have spoiled our fishing grounds long
enough; isn't it time for you chaps to man
our ship of defence and take some action? ”
THE FISHER-CHIEF: “ Not on your life ,
sonny. No one ’ud help me a few months
ago when I wanted to launch this little
craft o’ mine for that purpose; so the
enemy can do what damage they well far
as I'm concerned!"
The State Frights insects are dead-sure of
two things: (1) The States are the proper
authorities to run the Savings Bank busi-
ness; (2) the Commonwealth’s post-and-
telegraph olfices have the only proper
machinery to do the work. On the same
principle, it is quite clear that David Storey’s
hat shop ought to print and publish the Syd-
ney Telegraph. The Telegraph has the
only proper machinery for the job, and that
makes it as clear as mud that the job ought
to be done by somebody else who hasn’t got
the proper machinery.
Every now and then the Age forgets that
it isn’t the old Daily Syme. So, when Jack
Murray was talking of retiring, it said :
Friends of the Government are unable to see how
it is to weather the storm in the event of the Pre-
mier either going to London or retaining the leader-
ship.
When Jack Murray resolved to retain the
inactive-leadership of his party, the same
Age remembered that it was the voice of the
great “Liberal” party, and said:—
Intrinsically the electors care little whether a
Murray or a- Watt shall be the instrument to trans-
late into effect their wishes.
Since it came into office 12 months ago,
the first Labor Government in New South
Wales has been persistently dogged by ill-
fortune. Three strong Ministers —Neilsen,
Macdonnell and Carmichael—have been lost
to the Cabinet, one by death and two by
resignation, and, in addition, Speaker Cann
had to climb out of the Chair to help in the
firing line. Add to its weight of unforeseen
misfortune its voluntary load of parish
pumps, and its chance of catching the ’bus
appears so remote that even a Randwick
bookmaker would spring a fair shade of
odds against it.
The decision of the S.A. Ministry to do
nothing re certain charges of wholesale roll-
stuffing, is a piece of profound mismanage-
ment. The Upper House appointed a com-
mittee to inquire into the alleged placing on
its roll of bogus names, and the irregular
placing there of names that were not bogus.
The committee delivered a blighting report
against certain Labor men, charging them
with forgery and other sins. If the report
was maliciously inaccurate, or ignorantly
inaccurate, then there is need for an investiga-
tion before the law courts to give the accused a
chance to clear their characters. If it was
accurate, then the Labor party would get on
better without these questionable supporters.
The worst thing the Government can do is to
drop the case. No party can afford to be
suspected of conniving at corruption and pro-
fiting by corruption. The bad luck which
promptly befell Labor at the Adelaide muni-
cipal elections may be one of the results or
it may not—at any rate, it was an unfor-
tunate coincidence.
“Lord Onlinos” on British politics:—
Don’t know “Oxon” from the village blacksmith,
but think his remarks concerning the Asquith Min-
istry and the Opposition in Britain are biassed...
“Oxon” seems to think that all the genius left in the
Cold Country sits on the right of Speaker Lowther.
1 don’t. Stodgy lawyer Asquith, typical Whig and
ultra-solemn politician, upon whom the Giant’s Robe
has fallen—and almost smothers! If ever a man had
greatness thrust Upon him (by the Tadpole papers)
it’s Asquith—the English counterpart and enlarge-
ment of our own beloved Wade. Lloyd-George? Yes, a
great little man; a Terror and a Devil of Energy,
with a genius for language—also slanguage! The
brightest star in the Governhieht firmament. Brim-
stone Churchill? Tory renegade, and self-advertising
bounder; without scruple and without manners.
“There never was a Churchill worth a damn!” said
Disraeli bitterly, of the Duke of Marlborough of his
day. True. John Churchill, great military genius,
phenomenal diplomatist; mean peculator and shabby
adventurer, sold his sister first and his patron after-
wards ! Two hundred years later, Brimstone turns
traitor to the man who made him— Chamberlain —
thus keeping up the family record ! Latterly, Broken
Hill Truth, satirising Churchill, had these iines:—
Dare to be a Churchill—-
Dare to stand alone—
Near the Moving-Picture Man
And the Gramophone;
That hits him off. As to John Burns (extinct vol-
cano), Reginald McKenna (“Reggie Boy!”) and the
rest, what are they ? Those that aren’t Cohens are
Samuels, and so on.
The Dago must be sorry lie allowed the
war-correspondent to intrude into what was
merely a family squabble. Correspondents
have an awkward habit of telling the truth.
The Jap knew better.
He was very polite to
them away in the rear,
and even provided lec-
tures to explain how
battles were won. So
we never heard of mas-
sacres in Manchuria.
When the Wade Gov-
ernment proposed to re-
sume Bibbenluke, on the
Monaro (N.S.W.), the
Labor party denounced
the idea on the ground
that the appraised capi-
tal value was prohibi-
tive ; and, for that oppo-
sition, the Labor candi-
dates in the south were
denounced on every
“Liberal” platform as
the enemies of closer set-
tlement. Somebody ought
to apologise to the Labor
party now. The land is
all right, but produce
can only be got to mar-
ket by ruinous haulage
over hundreds of miles of
railroad to Sydney, be-
cause there is no rail-
way to the port at Two-
fold Bay. So, out of the
31 farms thrown open
on October 23, only nine
have been taken up, and
the disaster may be
written down as a re-
cord frost even for
Monaro.
Thus N.S.W. Labor Premier McGowen,
orating at Sydney Town Hall after Gaud
Mayor Taylor had fed the over-fed by way
of welcoming Governor Chelmsford back
again -
I trust that for years to come he will be spared
to remain the Governor of this State.
Reading which in the papers next day a
sour-minded Laborite turned up his Rule
Book, and having looked fixedly at Clause 1
(b) of the State Fighting Platform, which
proposes, “The abolition of the office of
State Governor and other unnecessary
offices,” said, “Hmm!” Just “Hmm!”
Cheerful view of what may happen to a
Speaker when there’s a Hatpin party in
the House :—-
Editor Bulletin, —I enclose a scrap from your
scurrilous paper, and ask you to think over it in the
light of recent events. Mr. Willis, the Scab, has not
scored, has he? Still, he has done an immense
amount of good in rousing the sleep}' Liberal woman
to fighting point. Very many women have agreed
with me that the Opposition were greatly to blame
that they did not drag the Blackleg Willis out of
the chair, and each give him a strong, contemptuous
kick as they passed out of the desecrated Chamber
of the House of Assembly.—Marie Boughton,
Moree. P.S. —I challenge you to print this.
The Fatmen’s newspapers are justified
in their protest against various workmen’s
defiance of Arbitration and Wages Board
awards; but the protest would have looked
less lop-sided if they had shown some little
concern at the action of the very rich Broken
Hill Proprietary in shutting down the mine
for two years because its directors disap-
proved of one of Justice Higgins’s awards.
What is “scandalous flouting of the law” in
the employee was merely a matter of busi-
ness in the employer.
Victoria, by way of a jest, is going
to import 6000 immigrants next year. Vic-
toria crowds a bigger proportion of its new
population into its one bloated city, and
settles a smaller proportion in the country,
than any other State, and as a natural re-
sult it has become the greatest exporter of
home-grown population in the Common-
wealth. What exactly is the good of spend-
ing money on importing British people when
it hasn’t sense enough to keep its own folk,
no one knows, not even John Weary.
Elwood Mead, the Vic. irrigation expert,
is up against a very old trouble. One of his
pet areas on the Murray is cursed by the
blight of aggregation, with the result that
holdings are growing larger and cultivation
smaller. This, however, is only a minor
annoyance, and it is not so disturbing as the
apparently growing distaste for irrigated
lands. According to the last Vic. Year
Book, the area of irrigated soil in Victoria
had decreased by over 50,000 acres in about
12 months. And this, in spite of the pro-
fuse booming that has been given to the
schemes of Mead.

THREAD WORMS EXPELLED
BY COMSTOCK’S “DEAD SHOT”
WORM PELLETS.
A BRISBANE WOMAN’S EXPERI-
ENCE.
Mrs. H. Campbell, Corbett Street, West
End, Brisbane, writes: —“My little girl, aged
five years, suffered from Thread Worms for
some months. I took her to the doctor,
who prescribed a syrup, but found it did not
do much good, as the symptoms still re-
mained. I saw Comstock’s ‘Dead Shot’
Worm Pellets advertised, and procured a
box, which proved very effectual. They
greatly relieved her, and she immediately
seemed to lose all trace of the trouble. The
dry cough and the restlessness at night and
the other symptoms left her, and she is now
in splendid health. You may use this as
you wish as a testimonial ”
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable preparation for the
eradication of Worms in children and adults.

NOTIONS
THE CHAMPION’S TIP.
[For The Bulletin.]
When questioned as to Australia’s chance of retain-
ing the ashes, Hill paused for a moment, then said:
If our players reproduce last season’s form 1 feel
hopeful. I am not going to prophesy—like some
of the critics—for cricket is a very funny game,
and anything may happen. But given ordinary cric-
ket luck, I think we will make a great fight of it.”
Victor Trumper holds exactly the same views. And
he, like Hill, qualified his remarks by stating that
the players were fully alive to the importance of the
task before them.— Enlightening item from S. M.
Herald.
Assuming that we don’t have six months’ rain,
And that no hostile force invades the State,
And that the plague does not recur again—
In- brief, if no strange ills eventuate,
One might—I say one might —make bold to say
A Test may soon transpire. . . . Observe, it may.
Nay, 1 will even further go than this,
And prophesy that Bardsley, if he’s fit,
And likes the pitch, and does not spoon or miss
The globule more than usual, he may hit
That Which the specialist in cricket lore
Is wont to term “a fairly decent score,”
Not that I wish to dogmatise. Not No! !
’Tis possible that fickle Chance or Luck
May smile on Albion, and Warren go
Disconsolate, pavilionwards—a “duck”
His tally. Cricket is, as all men know,
A game of glorious un —- ’Er, quite so,
The Finish? End? Result? My dear, dear sir,
Forgive the smile, but, what a thing to ask !
Who can do more than thoughtfully aver
'that Douglas has a paralysing task,
While Hill must battle, as they say, “a treat,”
To save his side the anguish of defeat.
One thing alone I can with confidence—
Or something like thereto —asseverate
(The tip should soothe inquirers in a sense)
’Tis this: Some time the game must terminate.
And yet... And yet... It may not happen so.
Ill Test match cricket you can never know.
N.s.w. D. B. J,
The sorrows of Ktft-handed trundler R. J,
Massie, the most promising colt in Sydney cricket,
are considerable. He was overlooked by the selectors
when the Ma team for the Warner match was picked,
and then chosen for the struggle against South Aus-
tralia when he was unavailable. Physically, he is a
fine specimen, filling a hole of 6ft. in the air, with a
displacement of 14st. gross. His father is H. II.
Massie, of international fame, a keen old warrior
who is not likely to let this promising sapling run
awry.
* * * *
Wicket-keeper E. J. Long, who got his
first inter-State glory in the N.S.W.-South Australia
match, has not been sitting on the doorstep of the
selection-room very long. A couple of seasons ago
he staggered humanity by disposing of eight of an
opposing XI by catching and flicking off the bails
when the batsmen were out of their ground. It is
unfortunate that he is such a poor batsman, and his
ability in scoring eggs is liable to retard his progress
in big cricket.
The match between Queensland and the
English XI was a circumstance which will be held
up for years as a shining example of the glorious un-
certainty of cricket. Queensland piled up 200 in the
first innings. The English could reply with only
275 ; and all Australia arose with a snort, and asked
what sort of an international team this was we had
got among us. The Englishman’s answer was that it
was good enough to wallop Queensland, anyhow,
which in the second innings made only 124. So the
English started their second attempt, only 139 be-
hind, and things looked bad. By the time three wic-
kets had fallen England had scored 140, and thereby
blew out on top with seven wickets to spare.
The only amazing circumstance about the
N.S.W.-South Australian match was the outbreak of
Cotter, of N.S.W., who built up 82 of N.S.W.’s 316
in 40min., to the amazement of everybody and him-
self. It was an unprecedented outbreak, for Cotter
has hitherto shone only as a bowler, guaranteed to
kill at lOOQyds. But this time he bashed four sixers,
six fqurers, two threes, eight twos, and 12 singles;
and did it in capital style. Glebe (Sydney), >yhere
he hails from, has not been able to; get a hat on since
the occurrence,
“Lucky” Warner, who was to have led
the M.O.C. team to v etory and the ashes, has been
given “out” by the doctors for the tour. His ill-
ness, diagnosed at first as a bilious attack, and then
as gastritiSo has taken definite shape as an ulcer
in the 1 lower portion of the stomach, and its cure,
though: practically certain, is a laborious .job. Re-
calls the fact that A. O. Jones, skipper of last
English XI in Australia, was also laid on the shelf
for a lengthy period. Johnny Douglas—he who
makes a run occasionally—is temporary skipper, and,
like the said Jones, fields in the hot Australian sun
without a hat. The only consolation Warner has in
his enforced docking is the fact that his average
for the tour will be 151 (his only score). Other-
wise, he deserves all the sympathy Australia will feel
for him.
* * *
The Victorian Cricket Association has
decided to make the return match England v. Vic-
toria a benefit to Rlackham, the man who showed
the world how to “keep” wickets without a back-
stop’s help.
* * * *
“Snorter”: Some of us have decided, once
and for all, that the average “flannelled fool,” whose
cuts and drives or swerves and breaks are discussed
with solemn seriousness by fat-headed lovers of the
game, is neither a real artist nor a true sport. He
is either a vain, spineless creature or a stupid boozer,
or both, having a natural turn and eyesight for
cricket, but being practically incapable of playing
the game for all he is worth, week in and week out.
Quite a number of the precious “star” cricketers are
boozers all the time. Hardly any of them —sober or
otherwise —live the self-denying life of higher-class
athletes. Oarsmen, runners, boxers, wrestlers and
gymnasts, engaged in risky work, need to keep them-
selves fit, and prepare themselves for every big un-
dertaking. An eight-oared crew, to be successful,
must be eight men who have done their level best to
get ready for a great endeavor. A team of cricketers
is composed of flannelled fools who have mostly been
“enjoying themselves” overnight, and are looking for-
ward—some of them —to a good booze after business
hours. Also, some of them take every opportunity to
booze during business hours, and are quite unfit to be
associated with the few who are actually fit. To talk
of such fuddled, bilious, nervous exponents of a boy’s
game as brilliant artists, or fine sports, is absurd.
The best thing that can happen to some of them is
an accident, which confines them to b.ed and keeps
them under the doctor's orders for a few days, dur-
ing which time they get purified on a milk diet. The
worst thing that can happen to them is the friend
and admirer who invites them to have a drink before
breakfast. Result, a duck’s egg, or a bowling
achievement of 0 wickets for 100 runs.
* * * *
Nothing very excitii'T transpired in con-
nection with Melbourne cricket last Saturday. East
Melbourne commenced its debate with North by
knocking up 364 runs at the price of seven wickets.
Seitz, who has contributed several three figure inn-
ings at inter-State discussions, and is trying to make
good for a place in a test match eleven, was respon-
sible for 10§, Northcote and South Melbourne met,
and Skinner’s darlings painfully compiled 208 runs
for seven wickets. In the Melbourne v, St. Kilda
affair, “Jumbo” Armstrong acquired seven wickets
on behalf of the former club for 55 runs, and now
suffers under the idea that his “leg break” was re-
sponsible for the slaughter.
The riders who have been accustomed to
the big six-day races in the U.S.A. and Europe, will
find the Australian contest a somewhat different
experience. In cold, bleak lands, this class of racing
is a winter sport, and takes place indoors, where the
men ride in a thick atmosphere of smoke and liquor
fumes. Riding in the pure Australian air, even
though occasionally thickened by a gentle dust-storm,
will be paradise compared to it, and no doubt the
strain will be much less on the riders. The J. D.
Williams people have now fixed up the conditions for
the grind, and, among a mult tilde of them, the
following are about the most important. Although
described as a six-day continuous race, it will start
at 12.5 a.m. on January 1, 1912, and spin till 10.5
p.m. on January 6. That will give 142 hours, or just
two hours off six complete days and nights. It’ll be
dreary work spinning round that track in the small
hours of the morning, when the spectators have de-
parted, and only the sleepy officials will lean against
the posts, as they curse in the chillv morning air.
All riders are to be medically certified, as fit to
undergo the ordeal before starting, and their food will
be suppl ed from a menu approved by a medical man.
In the event of a rider falling, and provided that
the referee is convinced that the fall is an acicdent
and the man is unfit to go on, and his team mate
isn’t about, he will be allowed a maximum of three
laps (nearly a mile) before starting again. Members
of the teams are forbidden to take part in the
sprint matches during the race. At Sydney Cricket
Ground a second track is to be laid down on the
grass inside the asphalt one, and on this the Six
Day race will proceed while the sprint events are
raging on the asphalt. The referee will be armed
with power to order the riders to ride on the grass
track at any time should he consider that the asphalt,
owing to rain or any other causes, has become danger-
ous. Team partners can relieve each other as often as
they think fit, but no competitor will be allowed to stay
continuously on the track more than 12 hours. Alto-
gether, most elaborate arrangements have been made
and the promoters seem to have provided for every
contingency that the trickery of riders (and some of
them are very tricky indeed) or the ingenuity of
bad luck can work out.
* * * *
Dick Arnst is now an amphibious sport.
Although not relinquishing the sculling-shell, he
will return to the giddy wheel in January, when he
will be seen daily at Sydney Cricket Ground, whirl-
ing round in the Six Day Raoe. Brother Jack is
also said to be tackling something of the same sort
in the land of Kaiser Bill, where the big guns
grow. After all, there is no reason why a good
sculler should not be a bikist of parts. Keeping up-
right at both games is a matter of balance, and the
same leg-muscles arc used in each method of pursuing
the prize money. Therefore, Richard the Great will
more than likely cut a considerable dash in the big
’contest.
When Victorian Justice a’Beckett ruled
that a tram-car was a vehicle within the meaning
of the Act, and therefore might be passed on the
off, or right-hand, side, he laid the foundation for
a pretty series of smashes and sudden - deaths.
Hitherto, motorists and others have had to pass a
tram-car on the near side, but a’Beckett says they
are under no legal compuls'on to do so. Of course,
the Judge has to administer the law as he finds it,
but, if he is right, the Weary Government had better
get a sudden move on and issue an Order-in-Council,
or something of the sort, to prevent motorists taking
advantage of the Judge’s ruling. To pass on the
right of a tram-car means, sooner or later, the meet-
ing of a car coming in the opposite direction, and
then, to escape the car, someone must charge into
the traffic on the other ='de, where the weakest will
go to the kerbstone, and be smashed. The matter
is a serious one.
* * * *
After all, P. O’Brien’s rn id on the 24 hours’
Motor Gvcle Road Championship of Australasia was
nothing to write home about. The course was an
88-mile out-and.-home stretch over which O’Brien
drove continuously a full day, and covered 48"9
miles, bettering the previous best of Harry B.
James by 28J miles. Considering that James ran
off his little lot as far back as 1902, when the
motor bike was a mighty crude affair compared
with what it is to-day, very much better results
were expected, and it is understood that O’Brien’s
rather poor showing will fetch a rush of riders who
believe that thev can do better. At least 500 miles
should be possible if the road is at all decent, and
presumably only a good road is chosen for such a
test. But then, are there any good roads in Vic-
toria? That’s the question.
Both cars and motor bikes are now being
driven in England on benzol, a by-product of coke
and gas-making. The men who have used it state
that it gives 25 per cent, more power than petrol,
and is amazingly economical. In England it is re-
tailed at 9d. per gallon. It is heavier than petrol,
having a specific gravity of 882 as against 720.
'1 his means, of course, that the carburettor float
rides higher, with the result that the starting-up of
the engine is affected. This trouble is, however,
easily got over by the simple expedient of putting a
small lead washer on the top of the float, so that
the liquid is brought up to the same level as when
petrol is used. Another difference is that the throttle
should not be opened so much, while more air is
required. If the stuff is as effective as they who
have used it say, it is going to prove a formidable
rival to petrol.
A durability record : An English motorist
declares solemnly and sincerely, so help him Joss,
that he has driven a Dunlop grooved motor tyre
cover the astounding distance of 23,004 miles.
Tyres and their covers are a gamble, and heat plays
a big part in the destructive work of Australian
roads, weakening the joints of the tubes, and causing
the imprisoned air to expand enormously and put an
additional strain on the weakening seams. In this
climate there is not much chance of any tyre lasting
out half the Englishman’s record.
The top-notch gee-gee, Bright Laddie, is a
popular prad around Brisbane (Q.) just now. The
reason thereof is that, although bowed down with a
mountainous load of lOst. 41b. on Saturday last, he
grabbed the Queensland Summer Cup from 14 others,
and enabled the tote to pay out £ll Bs. to those
who backed him. That is the sort of thing that
would make a bob-tailed donkey popular. Nothing
can prevail against it.
The Kangaroo team in England struck its
third defeat on Saturday, when Huddersfield seized
the animal by the tail, and banged it hard on the
earth by 18 points to seven. Still, the Kangaroo can
console himself with the reflection that it was the
champion club of the Northern Union which wiped
the floor with him. Anyhow, with 17 wins, three
biffings and a draw, the Kang, has not much to
grieve over.
The inter-State bowls kick-up last week,
between N.S.W. and Victoria, at Melbourne, was a
bad time for the Ma Staters. They won the first
scrap by 104 points to 85. Then Murray’s players
awoke suddenly, bogged in, and fairly squashed the
visitors by 125 to 85 and 104 to 82. The best
solace left the Ma State was that rink-skipper Moses
was not overthrown in the three matches, but even
that was barren solace to the men who were over-
thrown.

G. 11. Blakemore describes “sport” as he
finds it in Uncle Sam’s country: A few weeks ago,
$37,000 was paid for a pitcher and catcher by the
owners of the Pittsburg baseball team. The pitcher
cost $22,500. This money goes to the owner, who
sold the professionals, not to the men themselves.
Martz O’Toole was the pitcher; he gets in salary
SIO,OOO dollars per annum. That is to say, he has
sold himself for that sum, and his owner can sell him
for what more he will fetch. This is the greatest
price ever paid in America for a professional base-
baller. This week (October 19) is the last of the
baseball for the year. Every day, and twice on
Sunday, since about the middle of February last, a
game has been played on every club ground in the
Un’ted States, unless it rained or snowed, or one of
the players dropped dead. This week the different
leagues are playing for the Pennant. This is the
polite phrase; in the impolite, they are out for the
plunder. In New York the crack professional teams
are playing for the championship of what they call
the World’s Series. The first game had an attend-
ance of 37,216, who were charged $75,593 admission.
The National Commiss'on of Baseball got $7559. the
owner of the New York Club and the owner of the
Philadelphia club each got $13,606, and the players
of the two clubs (probably 40 men in all) got
$40,820. As not more than 20 men actually played,
the others got easv money. At time of writing,
three games of the World’s Series have been played.
The total receipts have been $195,914. and the 40
players have got $105,793 for three days’ “work.”
The players share in one more of the games, so it is
anticipated that, for the four days’ play, each
player in the two teams will scoop in S3OOO. After
the first four days, the owners of the clubs will divide
the plunder between them for the last three games in
the series. In addition to this S3OOO, several of the
first players have had “presents” of SSOOO motor-cars,
and many of the cracks get from SSOOO to $12,000
salaryL Still, the person who makes the most money
is the owner of a pennant team in a populous dis-
trict. It costs him probably $30,000 to get his men
in train, and, for an attraction, he may pay a sensa-
tional price like the $22,500 paid for Martz O’Toole;
but, if he has a star team, one season makes his
fortune. The American professional baseball game is
as near being a machine-made product as one can
find. The players are athletes, trained to the last
hair, guided by a set of mysterious signals that all
must understand and ’work to. Enthusiastic “fans”
or “rooters” (i.e., supporters) swear the game is above
suspicion. T am glad to have that assurance, because
I did not think it was.

There was nothing of the drawing-room
yachtsman about the bronzed and jolly dogs of the
Prince Alfred Yacht Club on Saturday, when the
“A” division of the fleet staggered out through the
Port Jackson heads and faced the tumbl'ng sea that
rolled over everything it met, and then fell into
huge holes right underneath. For five weary, wave-
washed miles the boats battled through it till the
mark off South Reef was turned, and then they beat
to southward to get a clear run for home. Yeulba
led over the line, followed by Ranee, Petrol
and Rawhiti 11., in that order. The “B”
division was composed of the • three biggest
yachts in Sydney waters, to wit, Culwulla
111., Rawhiti and Thelma. Culwulla 111. was
the limit boat, and maintained the four minutes start
till close to the end, where the towering Rawhiti
pressed very hard and got to within ssec. of the
winner. Thelma d’d not do too well in the heavy
sea. The prizes for both sections were donated by
Rupert Clarke, who followed the race in the official
steamer, and had his health drunk with a three times
three (which doesn’t mean nine drinks) on the run
home.
* * * *
The winning of the 18ft. championship of
Sydney Flying Squadron by Sunny South created
something like a sensation among the race fol-
lowers on Saturday afternoon. The wind was blow-
ing but moderately from the south. Towards the
finish of the race Hero was in the van, closely fol-
lowed by Sunny South, with veteran Christian Webb
in Golding closing down remorselessly on both of
them. Then, almost on the line, the skipper of
Sunny South blew out a great cloud of sudden can-
vas, and, with a bound, went past the struggling
Hero and won by 2sec. It was a great race, which
sent the people on the following steamer frenzied
with delight, till they suddenly realised that the
outsider had put their money into the pockets of the
gentleman who lays the odds. Then the cheering
died away.
They have taken a somewhat severe
dislike to Richard Arnst, in England, because of
his treatment of Barry. Barrv’s people offered
£SOO ex.’s and a similar stake; Richard asked for
£750 ex.’s, and the Englishmen say they will see
him in Heaven before they put it up. They consider
that £250 is ample to cover the actual ex.’s, and
the additional money was regarded as compensation
for Arnst’s surrender of his right to name the place
of settlement. And there the Englishmen stop, the
next move being left to Arnst. And Arnst does not
seem to be unduly movable about the matter.
N.JS. \Y. Rowing Association writes in re
the crew for the Olympic Games that, in the first
place, it favored a crew made up from all the
States, but found such an idea blocked by some
weird rule of the Olympic Council that the men
must be all members of one club. The Association
also says that better results could be got from a
crew all from one State, as the men would row in
one style, and more easily secure that perfect com-
bination so essential to successful eight-oar rowing.
Also, it declares that a crew from one State would
have a better chance of getting together early, and
would thus have the benefit of a longer period of
coaching. So, for these reasons, the N.S.W. Rowing
Association alleges that it put forth a crew of its
own, which, it asseverates, in no way debars other
States from doing the same. The cost was estimated
at £ISOO from the start, and there is no intention
of asking the other States to contribute, although
the crew will go as an Australian one, and not as
representing N.S.W. alone. Already, £4OO has been
raised without effort, and it is proposed to ask the
Government for a £ for £ subsidy, as was given
to the athletes who went to the Festival of Empire.
There are hopes that the men will get away in the
first week of March, and arrive home in August,
1912. Likely starters, to date, are Fitzhardinge, Dr.
Ward, Heritage, Middleton, Haucnstein, Gaden.
Parker, Barker, Ryrie, Dr. Smith, Dr. Doyle and
Amess Grandon. In that crowd it should be an easy
thing to find an experienced and weighty combina-
tion.
Adelaide City Council reports that it has
given accommodation on its Park Lands to 228 clubs
during the past year ; cricket 114, football 50, tennis
44 ; the rest, hockey, lacrosse, golf, croquet ami
bowls. These Park Lands are, roughly, seven miles
long by three furlongs broad, and completely sur-
round the city proper.
“Dick Itandall”: London Graphic, of
September 23, reproduces a picture by John A.
Lomax (“Counted Out”), that exemplifies, interest-
ingly, the artist’s immemorial tendency to know
nothing about his subject. In this case, one bruiser
is lying on his back on the boards, dead to the uni-
verse, while his opponent stands ready to resume
hostilities. A referee, in the costume of the George
IV. period, ticks off the seconds from a watch held
in one hand, while, with the other, he motions the
supplier of the punch to stand back. Except for
the absence of gloves, the costumes, the ropes round
the ring, which are too low to prevent the combatants
falling among the spectators in the guinea seats, the
absence of police, and the presence of “the fancy,”
armed with, whips to preserve order, the whole inci-
dent resembles exactly what occurs at a present-day
scrap, when a knock-down has been delivered. No
doubt, it was by attending such contests that Lomax
got his material. And that was where he fell in.
Asa fact, there was no such thing in the 18th cen-
tury as a man lying on his back in the middle of the
ring to be counted out. As soon as a fighter was
knocked down (and not before) a round ended. If
all right, he walked to his corner —if unable to walk
he was carried there by his seconds —and a full
minute’s spell was given. During this period his
seconds worked like demons to bring him round. If
at the end of the minute the invalid was unable to
respond to the call of “Time,” drastic remedies were
applied. These usually consisted in biting the pros-
trate one’s ear, or sticking pins into him. “Time”
was usually called thrice before the fight was
awarded to the victor, so the beaten man had every
opportunity to “make good.” Any amount of men
in the old days were knocked out for considerably
over 10 seconds, and yet won the fight in the long
run. Of course the game was, when feeling groggy,
to fall down at the first hit received, and thus gain
another minute’s spell. In over-anxiety to manage
this, many bruisers bad fights awarded against them
for falling without a blow. The system accounts for
the enormous number of rounds fought in some of
these contests. James Kelly and Jonathan Smith
fought for 6hr. 15min., near Melbourne, in 1855.
The hunt for a White Hope commenced ’in Mel-
bourne with Starlight v. Creedon, when the son of
Ham smote Daniel into silence in Act 1., scene 1.
The search was continued at the Guild Hall last
week end, Florio Franish, an Austrian wrestler, tak-
ing on a local lad named Barnett. Out of this tangle
of heavyweights, Barnett issued a winner in the
fourteenth round, but the White Hope is still rather
a forlorn expectation. Franish couldn’t fight, but at
first Barnett was afraid he could, and kept a respect-
ful distance. This coldness between them lasted
three rounds. Then Barnett discovered, with a
burst of glad surprise, that the Austrian couldn’t stop
a featherbed. After that, how did Barnett wade in!
Franish retired, after the fourteenth, and now an-
other Hope is wanted to exchange swipes with Mr.
Barnett.
* * * *
The vacancy on the A..J.C. Committee
created by the decease of trillionaire W. R. Hall,
caused a great gallop among four starters. The
winner turned up in E. A. M. Merewether, of the
Newcastle Merewethers, a family with a considerable
and ancient stake in the country. The new Com-
mittee-man is chairman of the Newcastle Jockey
Club, _so that he does not take his seat devoid of
experience of the tricks of the racecourse trade.
And, as Randwick is a sort of place where such
experience is sometimes, not to say frequently, re-
quired, the more of it that is kept on the premises
the better for the public.
“Exile” (from London) : “The Greater J. D. Wil-
liams performed a fine boost the very day the seven
Australian Governments united in one advertisement.
In the Daily Mail, a whole page, except
one solitary column, was devoted to a joint
paean of praise of the Commonwealth. The
spare column was filled with a hurricane blow
about the Greater J. D. Williams’s pedigree, nativity,
foresight, capacity, companions, travels, deeds, ideas,
theatres, picture-shows, proposed Coney Island at St.
Hilda, wealth, and financial prospects." The effect of
the great Australian ad. was marred by the greater
Williams’ ad. ; but J.D. made, a fine advertisement
scoop all the same.” [But The Bulletin, sniffing
at a distance, suspects that it was a Greater J.D.
Williams cheque that paid for the whole page.]

“Philoyid” : I referred in this paper once
to Abe Cohen, maybe the largest New York
butcher, with his constituency of not far off
1,000,000 Yids to work on. Also, I said
that New York Gentile-ity, of the fashion-
able order, was resorting to Abe, and other
aquiline-featured meatwrights, from an idea
that Moses knew his way about. A Gentile
relative of mine is seriously thinking of taking
his babe to the Synagogue, so impressed was
he with a great Jewish hygiene exhibit in
the General Hygiene Exhibition at Dresden.
It was the most effective display there. Not
only the right (Hebrew) and' the wrong
(Gentile) way of killing meat was illus-
trated, but also house building, water sup-
ply, drains, sewers, utensils, rules of eating
and drinking, ovens, fireplaces, grain stores,
flour mills, nursing, bathing, washing, and a
multitude of other details, all constituting
a mass of antique wisdom, disastrously
lost sight of by the Gentile multitudes.

SAMOL,
che new treatment for Rheumatism, Gout, Sciatica,
Lumbago, Eczema, etc.
DR. ALEXANDER LERCH (Chief Physician to
the first medical department of the Hospital of the
Brothers of Charity, Linz) : “I have found that ap-
plications of Samol have removed the most acute
pains in the cervical vertebra, and in the costal
cartilage on both sides of the sternum in a few 7 days.
In the case of a Rheumatic Joint, the swellings which
remained disappeared within 14 days of the applica-
tion of Samol.”
SAMOL is sold in tubes, price 1/6, 3/9 and 6/-.

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted, whether sent by post or handed
in; and no MS. will be returned unless stamps
(of any State) accompany.
P. C. Vassy: If things are as you state.
you should collect about a million pounds’ damages
from some military miscreant or other, ultimately;
so battle on and hope for the best. In its present
stage your case isn’t of sufficient public interest to
warrant us handling it... Harry: The gentleman who
had neither the time nor the inclination is bruised
all over through being tossed into the basket six
times a day for seven years. .. .F. the Famous:
You say that “kindness and consideration for others
are virtues” ; pity you didn’t think of that before
you wrote with a small corkscrew hand on both sides
of thin paper. .. . J.R.S.: That suggestion follows
an old well-beaten track. .. .G.J. (V.) : Have re-
served three for a second reading. Others too slight
and unskilful. .. .L.M.D. (V.): Thanks, but we are
unable to use it.... Fizz: It may, but it doesn’t
sparkle.... Toey: “Amidst the Golden Grain” is a
hard-working poem, which plods its weary way across
two fields of foolscap, and leaves the reader mopping
his brow distractedly, two miles from a pub....
Larebil: John Weary poem put to bed in the basket.
. ...G.M.: Verses are rather dainty; but at present
you lack technical skill. Try again.... Sapliead:
Declined with some regret. You appear to hail from
the Land of Promise. .. .J.R.D.: 'the million is not
earned. No substance in the yarn.... Claymore:
Labored verse. ..Jim Swag: Is it home-made puddin’,
or did you acquire it on the road ? No name or ad-
dress on MS.: —
POEM ON PUDDIN’.
The joys of puddin’ eatin’ is the joy of joys to me
I’m offally fond of puddin’ for breakfast, dinner and
tea ;
1 don’t care wevver it’s hard or soft, overdone or
tough,
As long as it’s puddin’ that’s all I ask, but it must
be quantum suff.
Some puddin’s is soft and squash}', like the stood
froot anti the rice;
That’s orlright on a summer’s day, yer can swaller it
in a trice ;
But it don’t fill up the vaccum —it don’t fill up th’
void ;
There’s a sort of empty feelin’ as makes yer feel
annoyed.
No, gimme the puddin’ wots thick and fat an’
studded throughout with plums
Wiv some nice sweet sorce poured over it, by gosh
that’s good to the gums
Wiv lumps of sooet to please the eye as melts in
your mouf like worter
An’ a spicy taste-—oh yum yum yum, that’s the
pudden as I can slorter!
. . . .F.D. (U.S.A.) : Breezy home verse, but a fathom
or so below publication point. . . .V.E.L. (M.L.) : Too
whirling and indefinite. . . .W.N. (W.A.) : Lay aside
your feverish pen and ask the lady to be yours. . . .
L.S. (V.) : Once again we hold out the basket of
friendship. Put it there!... .D.B.K. (V.): Your
enthusiasm is very fine, but it is merely a rhymed
catalogue of (1) the gumtrees (“graceful, shapely”) ;
(2) mountains (“bathed in sunlight”) ; (3) glory
of the sunset; (4) breakers on the shore; (5) warble
of the magpie—and other poetical props. . . .M.F.K.
(V.) : Storm' rhyme and “Beneath” disappointing.
First is blown-up or pumped, and the other is a weak
handling of an old theme G.B. (V.): The course
is down this column: —-
THE RACE OF LIFE.
This life is like a mighty race
With the handicaps unfair
For some are put behind the scratch
Misfortune placed them there.
The pistol goes when we are born
The struggles many share
Fair fortune is the winning-post
And those who pass are rare.
Led on like bulldogs by the scent
We rush along the line
If we win ere we are forty
We have won in even time.
The tracks are not all even
For some are short and sweet
While others they are long and rough
For the millions to compete.
Yet we are the promoters
And makers of the speed
Not for the love of running ,
But to satisfy our need.
The ones who are now leading
Jamb the ropes on those far back
And a multitude are running
As though they’re in a sack.
The stride is getting shorter
Though the struggle has increased
And the cries which come from the fallen
Never yet have ceased.
When the tide of life is ebbing
And in the gloom we gain the gole
We leave it all behind us
And think about our soul.
W.A.F.: Think you will find it in most reciters.
If you have never heard a suburban elocutionist fire
the old chestnut at liis helpless audience as an en?
core, you are luckier than you deserve to be
A.H. (Q.): Not eligible for a poet’s license just yet.
E.C. (S.A.) : Sorry the charge isn’t driven home.
Hugh P.: “Love’s Plea” dismissed with costs.—
E.T.S. (V.): Regret all unsuitable. .. .E.A.A.:
“Dave’s Packet” is agreeable, but too slight.
man: Thanks, and you’re no doubt right. But you
won’t do any good by flapping your wings; come
right down to earth, and send us some plain, un-
painted particulars. This paper is just a hog for
plain particulars without paint... .T.M.: You don t
throw any new light on an old subject, or any old light
in anew way.... D.W.M. (and others) : Can’t un-
dertake to return unsuitable pars. .. .F.L.D.: Well
put- together. But in the first there wasn’t enough
material to go right round ; and the second has seen
better days. Nearly every family man in. the
country has offered to drown half the children if the
lady who was inquiring about “the place” thought
there were too many. . .L.K.: Don’t puzzle any more.
The sum won’t work out K.G.: Judged by the
patent office returns, the Victorians are the most, and
the Tasmanians the least inventive people in the
Commonwealth. Last year, one Victorian in every
1225 apnlied for a patent, and one Tasmanian in
every 4254.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CONTRIBUTORS.
S.S.: There is only a faint glimmer of hope in
either of them H.S.: The play upon the “dear”
girl and the “expensive” girl, is as old as the English
language.... Lor: An unpleasantly suggestive thing.
.... AVilfred G.: Your drunk gives the impression of
having three legs, and that is too much.... Fitz:
Very very ordinary jests, and the pictures attached
are dead Alf K.: Sketch of two coarse ruffians
committing murder of no use to us... .C.S.: . Not
much of an idea, and the drawing has the painful
accuracy of a balance-sheet or a timber yard....
E.F.: Dear little boy of 10, put away your pen and
paper and go. out and play cricket.
All the family of which “Smiler” Hales is
one have loved the smell of printing ink.
James Hales, who, at the age of 60, has
pulled his last proof in Adelaide, ran a local
Mining News and Standard, with his
brother Frederick, for years. In his spare
time he was a prominent A.N.A. man.
“Small Beer”: The day of the small
brewer in Australia seems to be done. Either
the bigger concerns are swallowing up the
lesser ones, or they are amalgamating for
natural protection. Recently the Marshall
Brewery Cos. (Sydney) moved from Padding-
ton to Leichhardt, but it had only just got
in working order, when Tooth and Cos. came
along and bought it out. This leaves Sydney
in the hands of three local beer-producers.
Tooth’s, Toohey’s, and Resch’s. Likewise,
in tiie Flyspeck, J. Boag and Sons, Ltd., the
Tamar : Brewery and the Tasmanian Co-op-
erative of Launceston are negotiating; and
if this combine comes off, it will have prac-
tically a monopoly of the northern trade of
the island and a big share of the southern.

SCALES ON SCALP
HER HAIR FELL OUT
Tried Hair Washes Without Benefit;
Used Cuticura Soap and Ointment.
In a Few Months Hair Grew Several
Inches. “They Will Cure Others
as They Cured Me.”
‘Some two years ago my hair began to
fall out, which was caused by scales on the
scalp. I consulted chemists who advised me
to use certain hair washes, etc. These I
tried, but without any benefit. In fact, they
seemed to irritate the scalp. I was advised
by a friend to use Cuticura Ointment, but
did not do so at the time, but purchased a
cake of Cuticura Soap and bathed my head
several times daily in hot water. After con-
tinuing for some weeks, the scaly irritation
was completely removed from my head.
“I then wrote for a sample of Cuticura
Ointment. I used that, with a tin purchased
from the chemist, and I am pleased to say
that the effect on my hair was simply mar-
velous. In a few months it grew several
inches, and it is now as glossy as when I was
a girl. I still continue to shampoo my hair
with Cuticura Soap weekly, and to use
Cuticura Ointment on the scalp to prevent
dandruff, etc. I would advise anyone suffer-
ing from scalp disease in any form to give
Cuticura preparations a trial, fully believing
that they will cure others as they cured me.”
(Signed) Mrs. Anne Browne, 136 Frances
St , Leichhardt, Sydney, N. S. W., Nov.
15, 1910.
For more than a generation Cuticura Soap
and Cuticura Ointment have afforded the
speediest and most economical treatment for
itching, burning, scaly and bleeding skin and
scalp humours, of young and old. A single set
is often sufficient. Cuticura Soap and Oint-
ment are sold throughout the world, but to
those who have suffered much, lost hope and
are without faith in any treatment, a liberal
sample of Cuticura Ointment with 32-p.
booklet on the treatment of skin and scalp
troubles will be mailed free, on application.

An Interesting
Experiment.
If you would like to see the alteration Grey
Hairs make, just lay a piece of paper over each of
the two halves of the above portrait. The Grey
“half” will then be seen to have the appearance
of 45 years of age, whereas the other half looks
only 30. Dr. B. Allen’s (tf.S.A.) Mexican Walnut
Stain will make all those years of difference if you
are grey or prematurely grey. It is perfectly
harmless, easy to apply, and will quickly restore
the hair to the natural shade of youth, or younger
years.
Dr. B. Allen’s <u.s.a.)
Mexican
Walnut Stain
is offered as a Superior Stain. It contains no lead,
mercury, silver, sulphur, etc., and is equally suit-
able for Ladies’ Hair, or Hair of the Beard or
Moustache. None genuine without the signature

the difficulty is when to stop, for “ Skippers” are so nice—
so different from the old sorts —that you feel you really
must finish the tin. The best of it is they do you good,
however many you eat-—they’re twice as nourishing as
oysters ; three times as nourishing as cod or haddock.

FLEETING SHOWS.
“D.”: The summer season is here once more, and
contemporaneously arrives that most inexplicable of
all shows, the Shark, which may be viewed dead —
extremely dead—in a tent for 6d. On any fairly
well-frequented beach, just now, a blizzard of awful
smell is liable to swipe the passer T by oyer the nos-
trils. This attracts his attention to > a weather-
beaten, bootless and sockless man, who stands on
guard outside a small canvas structure some distance
away. Assume that the passer-by pays the money.
He peers inside. An odor like unto nine million de-
ceased prawns pours into his face. Through the mist
he views an inert, pallid mass of meat, smaller than
a dead horse, unlovelier than a slain pig. When he
can stand the polluted atmosphere no more, he drops
the flap of the noisome mausoleum, and hurries
away. Sharks mostly look the same and use the same
brand of scent. Yet each fresh one that is exhibited
cold in death, draws the same old crowd of scruti-
neers. I suppose it is due, in part, to man’s love of
personally seeing his foe out of action; but when
the circumstances surrounding the death-bed are
taken into consideration, the explanation appears in-
adequate,
“Bloggs”: What an absurdity it is for England
to blither about the “brutality” of boxing, when
such sports as motor-racing are warmly encouraged.
A London paper quoted the following Yankee advt.
of an automobile contest last month: —-
“SHAKING DICE WITH DEATH!
20 DARE DEVIL DRIVERS
IN THRILLING SPEED DUELS.
THE FIELD Vs. DEATH—WHICH WILL WIN?”
“YES THEY RACE ALL NIGHT!
DEATH DARING
SPINE CHILLING
NERVE TINGLING
24 HOUR
AUTO RACE.”
A Los Angeles bulletin of the race ran: —
“24 hour race accident bulletin.
Race finishes Sunday, 4 p.m.
A thrill every second.
6.40 p.m.
Car 4 ran into car 7.
Two men Hurt.
Come out to see the Spills.”
Of course, the crudeness of the above was sternly
reprobated, but the fact remains that the prospect
of a tragedy, which draws the U.S. crowd (and is
frankly recognised by the promoters as having this
effect) is the same thing which draws British crowds
to similar shows. The Aerial Post arrangement,
lately started in London, and since abandoned, was
a frank appeal to the same sentiments. Within a
week one of the fliers, Hubert, had fallen, smashed
both his legs, and half killed himself, while the
other, Hamel, side-stepped Death, by the narrowest
margin, four several times. What emotions save
those of bloodthirsty excitement can inspire the
crowds which patronise those exhibitions? By com-
parison with them, the knocking-out of Wells by
Johnson would be a mild parlor game.
“Harrison O.”: I hate good concerts; but occa-
sionally I go to one for her sake. I. dislike having
to sit on a hard chair to listen to stout tenori
warbling absurd love ditties, and soprani singing
of bees and honey, and I dislike the dowdy suburb-
anites who patronise high-class concerts, and try to
look intense all the time a song is being perpe-
trated, and then give vent to shoddy enthusiasm
when their boredom is mitigated. But most of all
I dislike the atrocious manner in which the per-
formers waste time. They are practically under
engagement to give at least one extra number after
each item (if they did not their victims would be
able to escape before nine o’clock) ; and, yet, after
the fat tenor has hurled his final top note, he ambles
off as if he had not the slightest intention of
causing any further disturbance. After a few
seconds, in response to the banging of a number of
people who are really anxious to get home, but
who, nevertheless, feel called upon to make a noise,
the songster returns, places a fat hand upon his
starched shirt front, and gives an imitation of a
penguin stooping to drink. Then he ambles off
again; but the uproar continues, and he comes back
and bows some more. After repeating this per-
formance about five times, he makes the request
to Maude to Come into the Garden, which he had
intended making from the start. Why should he
keep both Maude and myself waiting, to say nothing
of possible depreciation of the garden, while he per-
petrates his pedestrian foolishness? At high-class
concerts the items set down on the programme
could generally be disposed of in 30 minutes; extra
items take about another 45 minutes; while a
further 50 minutes are wasted by the performers
in pretending that they do not want to accept the
encores they would be so mad about if they didn’t
get that they would be capable of slaying the
audience for not giving them.
THE WHALE THAT FLOATS!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Whale at the Heads.—Captain Manson, of the col-
lier Wallarah, reported to the Department of Naviga-
tion that he had sighted a dead whale floating off
Sydney Heads. The whale was a large one, measur-
ing about 80ft., and might prove dangerous to small
vessels. —S. M. Herald.
N. S. Wales will float additional Loans to the
amount of £3,400,000 before the end of the financial
year.— Budget.
Voices: ,
Ahoy ! Ahoy ! What ship’s that f
The Ma... Cap’n McGowen... Who are you?
The Floating Whale —£loo,ooo,ooo, or so, long!
Recitative :
Behold! Behold!
The Mariner Bold—the Hero of voyages manifold—
Rolling down with a cargo of gold. ..
Gold !...
Strophe:
What pleasant dreams has he!
The sailor bold and free—
Bold with his gold—
Free with his £ s. d. !
Antistrophe :
A Sail! A Sail! A Sail!
A sail upon the lea !. . .
Nay, ’tis the Floating Whale l
The Mariner turneth pale ;
His face is white in the failing light
That darkens on the sea !...
Lo ! where this eometh !
Hark ! how he hummeth 1
Slow vengeance he wreaketh—
Dead l Yet he squeaketh I
See! where he sneaketh
Over the surges...
What, oh, what urges
This monster, reft of all motion,
Over the seething, implacable ocean?
Strophe:
Hark I Hark!
From yonder barque
Through the dark. ..
A voice that screams,
Breaking his dreams!
Voice:
Ahoy l Ahoy!
It’s the Little Boy from Manly-by-the-Sea!
Something comes ! Lord, it hums !
A Whale, it seems to me—
Say, skipper! Get your gun, and give the brute a
boost!
Here’s one of them old South Whales a-coming
home to roost!
Recitative (dolce):
Let me, behold!
The Mariner Bold-
Rolling down with a load of gold,
Bold and free on the stormy sea. ..

Medium Sized Women
The La Diva Corset No. 718 which is here
illustrated is unequalled for short and medium figures,
especially those requiring short boned corsets. It
increases the apparent height, giving to the figure a
graceful, svelte appearance, and insuring the proper
set of the gown. While snug and cosy, the fit is
so perfect that absolute comfort is achieved with it.
Wherever well-gowned women are seen, at the
theatre, at dinners, at balls, etc., you may be sure
that many of them owe their chic appearance largely
to a La Diva Corset.
You should ask your draper to show you

A Christmas Suggestion.
, It is as difficult to choose the perfect
Christmas present as the perfect wedding
present. Now is the time when you are
worrying over the Christmas reminder
you will send to your friends overseas.
The perfect Christmas present for the
other side of the world must be easily
packed; it must not be fragile; it must
not be the sort of gift that could be
,bdught in your friend’s town; it must be
uniquely Australian—in short, it must
be the half-yearly bound volume of The
Lone Hand.
This gift, the May-October volume, is
bound handsomely in cloth with gold em-
bossings. It is the essence of Australia
—as characteristically Australian as the
scent of gum leaves. Not only is it a
beautiful present, but it is a great
national advertisement for your own
country. It tells your friends overseas
more about Australia than all the letters
you could write.
As the volumes are now being bound,
it is advisable for you to send in your
order at once—Price, 6/6. Postage :
Australasia, 1/2; otherwise, 2/4.
The only guarantee readers have of
getting The Lone Hand regularly
month by month, without missing a num-
ber, is to subscribe. The subscription
rates are :
Australasia: 6/- per annum,, post free;
or 3/- for six months, post free.
Abroad: 9/- per annum, post free.
As a refreshing and blood-cleansing drink
for the hot weather, take ‘“Montserrat”
Lime Juice. Ask your storekeeper for
“Montserrat,” and don’t take any other
lime juice. *
It is not often that one feels like framing an ad-
vertisement, and seldom that one sees an advertise-
ment that is good enough, but in this year’s “Robur”
calendars we have such pictures as seem 'wasteful not
to frame. The copy or Vigee Le -Brim's portrait
of herself and child, “the original of which is to be
seen in the Louvre, Paris, is a delightful production,
and the copy of Marcus Stone’s “Stealing the Keys,”
which is said to be one of the most popular pictures
in the Sydney National Art Gallery, -is wonderfully
well done, as is also F. P. Mahoney’s “In Days of
Old,” an Australian work of high merit, dealing with
the bushranging times. The co.’s advertisement
appears in this paper, and jmu will see that they
supply grocers and storekeepers with calendars, in
order that they may be distributed to their customers
free. *
IN BANANA LAND
“Dr” Kidston suggests the founding of a
Chair of Political Economy in connection
with the Queensland University, and pro-
poses the veteran, A. H. Barlow, as the first
professor. But if politics be, as once de-
fined, “the art of climbing over the people's
packs into a snug billet,’* isn’t “Dr.” K.
entitled to the first professorship himself?
“A.Y.A.” : After reading “Leo Lear’s” pre-
diction (B. 26/10/’ll) that “the Burnett
and Bowen districts are going to resurrect
their defunct sheep-growing industry,” and
that he was “backing the corpse to stay
dead,” I hasten to urge him to set up in
business as a crystal-gazer. His information
would be quite as unreliable as the best of
them. As a matter of fact, there are now
and have been during the past few years,
amidst drought and the opposite meteorologi-
cal phenomenon, thousands of sheep in the
Burnett district.. Since the long time ago
which “L. Lear” is apparently writing of,
more successful methods have been adopted
by the wool-growers, and I hope, before very
long, to see the district loaded up with more
sheep than it ever carried before. Mean-
time, prosperity has not been loafing when it
was the turn of the Burnett, and, when we
get the railway line, keep your eye on us.
“Don Q.’s” few plain remarks:—
That discredited old dead-beat, Warwick Town
Council, has given its rags another gallop in the
limelight. Despite the fact that it lives in one of
the richest agricultural districts of Queensland, it
has long been stone-broke, as a result of its periodi-
cal financial jags. About a . year , ago it appeared be-
fore the State Treasurer with a hard-luck story, and
a request for £lOOO or £l5OO or thereabouts,
although it was hopelessly in debt to the Treasury,
and had .not-met even its interest bill. With the
hide of an old-man turtle, it suggested that the new
loan should be issued, less the amount owing, but
even Denham couldn t stomach that, and shooed the
cadgers off the premises. Since then things have
been going from bad to worse, and the other day the
auditor reported: (1) That the expenditure had ex-
ceeded the revenue by £1272 on the general ac-
count; (2) that £650 had been drawn from the loan
rate account, and placed to the general fund, in
order to finance the council; (3) that this was in
contravention of the Act, and the money would , have
to he put back before December 31 ; (4) that in
order to ensure the Government subsidy, £BOO had
to be paid into the park account within five week’s ;
(5) that the estimated expenditure to the end of the
year was £6OO, and the probable expenditure
£1701; (6) that the council was within £2OO of
its limit at the bank. Whereupon, the council, after
scratching the place where brains are usually kept,
decided that as it couldn’t borrow any more, and
couldn’t run into any more debt, and had no money
in its pocket, the worst had just about been accom-
plished. So it resigned in a body, which doesn’t
seem a fair recompense when there are so many
cheap poisons on the market.
The Puk-Wudjies.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Puk-Wudjies—the Little People—-the Pigmies.
-IHawatha.
Now the Puk-Wudjies were an olden clan
Whose home was a cave or a den ;
Full Two feet Ten did their tallest span,
And they hated the Full-grown Men ;
And if ever a wight of a burly breed
In the Wudjie land would stray,
With a thousand darts they would make him bleed
In the dark Puk-Wudjie way.
For the Wudgies held that a man who rose
An inch o’er the three-foot mark,
Was a man to count mid the Wudjies’ foes,
And meet for a stab in the dark ;
For the cream of Beauty and Brain and Wit
They found, in a Two-foot Ten,
And they damned as food for the Brimstone Pit
The Race of the Full-grown Men.
And the notions, too, of the Puk-Wudjies
Were tied in the Two-foot Ten ;
They talked of geese with the words of geese
And the style of an ancient hen ;
And if e’er they dropped on a grain of sense
In a bright Puk-Wudjie’s crown,
They haled him forth for the dire offence
With a “Down with the Traitor —Down!”
“To the Wudjie race we have said good-bye,”
Ye say, “and the dwarfs are gone” ;
But alas! the midgets multiply
As long as the world goes on ;
Ye will see their darts in the big man’s back,
His blood on their lances small;
He is still a butt for their wild attack
Is the Upright Man and Tall.
For Two-foot Ten is the Wudjie’s height,
An ounce is the Wudjie’s brain ;
And the Wudjie’s all have a deadly spite
On the man with ounces twain ;
So, an’ ye would walk in the ways of Peace,
Just gang like the Wudjie men,
And find that the wits of a nation cease
At the height of Two feet Ten.
QUEENSLAND.

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, December 2, 1911;
My Dear Tiiargomindah,—
Despite the fact, that the weather clerk
is piling up centuries, the Macgregors have
been attending the big cricket and the Cale-
donian sports. Nevertheless, Ascot, with its
cool breezes, green lawns, good music and
opportunities to lose money, is irresistible to
our aristocratic ladies. At the last meeting
there, the medical Carvosso lady aired white
embroidered muslin. Mrs. W. J. Trotter and
Mrs. Ross Munro also wore white gowns
calculated to arouse envy in Sister Woman,
but, on the whole, there was little that was
remarkable in the way of coverings.
The McCawley-O’Hagan wedding, of which
I warned you last week, duly took place, the
bride wearing a novel but entirely becoming
tailored costume of white satin, and a white
picture hat. Her maids, likewise, were built
on tailored lines, and the guests decked them-
selves in their most amiable expressions and
gladdest rags. Attorney-General O’Sullivan
and Under-Secretary for Justice Hall patted
the bridegroom on his Crown-Solicitorial
back so enthusiastically that the bride gazed
at him with augmented respect and increased
pride of possession.
THE PARSONS PARADISE: A HERESY HUNT.
ENTHUSIASTIC CLERICAL SHADE: “ There he goes! After him, boys! When he was on
earth he had his doubts about eternal punishment!”
The Agent-General Robinsons, who are
still keeping their heads above tea, will re-
turn from the North in time to assault the
Christmas turkey with the Denham house-
hold. The Lucinda will be commandeered
for the occasion, and Moreton Bay will be
the grave of the dead marines. For the
present, the small daughter of the A.-G. pair
has been sent to join her parents in Rock-
hampton, and take part in their tour of in-
spection, and whatever else is on the menu.
Robert Pihilp and Mrs. leave early in 1912
for the Land of Cakes. Other outward-
bound travellers will include Jean, of the
Ross-Munro clan, and her brothers. Miss
Jean will be chaperoned in part by Mrs.
Robinson. Early in the New Year Mrs.
James Milne and family leave for the Bull
• Country, where they will spend several years
and other assets.
Half the Murray family has drifted in
from the wilds of Blackall, where its mem-
bers turn an odd copper or so on an Outback
station. They came to be present at the
marriage of Jean of that ilk with W. E.
Graham, barrister. In honor of the event,
the Hon. John and Mrs. Murray bade their
friends eat together yesterday. The bride-
elect wore something in Tosca net over char-
meuse, and the attack on the food took place
under the shade of the spreading mango tree.
All went well, including the iced champagne
cup.
On Tuesday, Mrs. Gilbert Wilson ably
assisted conductor Sampson to push the Mus-
ical Union concert to its destination. The
Christmas concert will have Mrs. Robert
Bell and Miss Lena Hammond to lend point
and good voices to “The Messiah.”
The continued illness of Mrs. J. L. Wool-
cock has given that lady’s relatives and
friends an anxious time. She is one of the
most cheery hostesses and philanthropic
beings in our midst, and her return to her
wonted health and spirits is earnestly looked
for. Mrs. Jack has good nature developed
to an abnormal degree, and her home has
been the scene of some of the merriest gath-
erings of late years.
Miss Eileen Ranken is being made the
excuse for a number of tea-drinking contests
these days. On the 16th, the popular young
person will become Mrs. Cannan, but, in the
meantime, Mesdames White. Donald Cam-
eron, Gleghorn, and her sister, the Roger Har-
tigan lady, have taken a hand in helping the
lady to bear up.
Playing the part of Vivian, in “The Pass-
ing of the Third Back Floor,” is Miss Ena
Collins (otherwise Shanahan), one of our
foremost amateurs. She has made a splen-
did start in her professional career, and the
co., which includes another Brisbane girl
(Miss Tempe Pigott), speaks very highly of
her prospects. Her engagement will proba-
bly interfere with the performance of “lolan-
the,” which the Bohemian Club intends giving
in aid of the Mater Misericordise Hospital.
Ena was to have played lolanthe.
In the near future, the seaside community
of Southport, swelled to greater numbers by
its hundreds of “summer boarders,” will wit-
ness the alliance of Hamlyn-Harris, a
younger brother of Dr. Ronald Hamlyn-
Harris, D.Sc. (Curator of the Museum), and
Miss Mairnie Stevens, the youngest daughter
of E. J. Courier Stevens, M.L.C.
Yours affectionately,

ning to drop its aboriginal names, and chris-

The Earnest Jap.
The Bulletin’s old friend “Akenehi,” of
the “Woman’s Letter,” after 26 days’ travel
in Japan, does an ink-think: —
I have a quarrel with the horde of writers —travel-
chroniclers and romance-weavers—on Japan and its
people. Even books published in quite recent years
seem to be in an inky conspiracy to lure the intend-
ing traveller into the belief that he will find the
little brown folk dreaming by the margin of gold-
fish ponds, smiling under trellises of wistaria, medi-
tating on temple steps in the amber afternoon, en-
tertaining the Englishman in “toy-like” houses with
“doll-like” tea services and courtesy. “Irrespon-
sible,” “toy-like,” “unreal,” “butterfly-wise,” “child-
like,” and “playing at life” are amongst the phrases
used and reiterated by these writers to describe a
people who, of all others, know the importance of
being earnest.
New York itself is a laggard in pursuit of the
dollar in comparison with Japan in her chase after
the yen, after education, after an army and a navy,
and anything else that the Occident has in a large
or small way. The pertinacity of the Japanese
trader—man or woman—is a combination of Jew,
Chinaman and devil-fish, reinforced by insistent, smil-
ing courtesy. Whether it be a high-priced piece of
cloisonne, or a farthing toy, the efforts of the seller
to make you buy are never relaxed until you have
bought or left his neighborhood. In a Nikko shop
I bought some furs for Sydney friends, and looked
at others. For three mornings, the little old
woman who keeps the peltry place squatted on the
mat outside my bedroom door, with the furs I had
glanced at piled beside her. She used to come as
early as six o’clock, and squat and smile and entreat,
and despite my curt negatives her smiles never grew
fewer or her obeisances less profound. Her husband
was haunting, squatting and smiling at other tourists’
bedrooms, with other furs. Their daughter was no
less persistent in the shop. Their little son was
helping to cure the pelts by day, and going, alter-
nate evenings, to Japanese and English schools.
As for the war-game, we never got out of eye-
shot of its practice. Did we ascend the castle or
temple towers in this or that city, there on the
plains below were extensive cavalry manoeuvrings.
Were we_ driving over a country road in the grilling
heat, or in rain and deep mud, we would surely meet
or overtake a long line of marching infantry, heavily
laden with accoutrements. A glance from the bal-
cony of our hotel (in this or that mountain dis-
trict), soon after daybreak, and filing through the
narrow streets, up between the giant trees, past the
temple gates (there is always and everywhere a
temple), went a long line of khaki-clad men- —men
horsed, men on foot, men and gun carriages.
In the cities, the sight and sound of the military
drilling of high school boys is ever in evidence.
The school uniform of these youngsters is mili-
tary—a German cap, tunic with brass buttons,
breeches, and puttees. When we wearied of meeting
the adolescent or adult soldier, and his small and
very haughty officer, we just turned the other way
and encountered detachments of men-o’war’s men on
a “hardening tramp.” Talk about a nation on a
war-footing ! That’s Japan !
If the traders and the. army and navy are in
earnest, so are the school-goers. Now, it is an or-
dinance that the pupils—boys as well as girls—
attending the primary schools shall wear a skirt —a
kind of divided garment (such as Australian women
cyclists used to wear). It is no unusual sight to see
grown men-so skirted in a group of school boys. In
one instance, I noted an old, skirted man, with a
straggly grey beard, carrying books in the usual
Jap. fashion —wrapped in a square of printed cotton.
On asking our guide if he were one of the masters,
we got a surprised negative. “That is a school bov.
He has not had an opportunity for schooling till
now, when he has perhaps made money. It is not
unusual.”
The farmer and his men toil terribly. The
women of the working classes toil terribly, and keep
the birth-rate on the higher scale. If the curious
tourist asks somewhat about the pretty young Crown
Princess, all the information forthcoming will be,
“She has four sons.” Nothing else matters.
Hast heard of the Fox God ? He is the deity
reverenced by merchants, tradesmen and all who desire
success in business. “Young ladies going into busi-
ness especially ask his aid,” explained a young
Japanese (who had never travelled) to me. “What
kind of business?” I asked. “Would it be type-
writing and teaching?” He hesitated. “Perhaps; yes,
or for the business you call—demi-monde, eh?” The
Fox God’s temples are swamped with offerings for
prayers granted, his shrines are rarely without wor-
shippers expectant of favors. In Tokio, we stayed
at an hotel owned and managed by a Japanese who
had never been out of his country. A French chef,
several Swiss waiters, beautifully, furnished bedrooms,
with the latest in bathrooms, telephones and electric
dressing and reading-lights attached, left nothing
to be desired in such matters. Just opposite the
main door was a pretty composition in stone and
marble, with carved foxes looking alertly from its
various points. Until I leant out of my window very
early, and saw the proprietor himself reverently plac-
ing snow-white rice cakes on white paper napkins
before the two closed tabernacle doors, I had
thought the shrine to be merely an ornament. Pre-
sumably there was a fox image,, the real thing
in prick-eared deities, behind each closed door. The
owner of the modernity within the hotel and the
ancientry without, presently stood a moment in
prayer, then departed. Several of the ’rickshaw men
hurried forward and gazed raptly towards the unseen
presence, that could, if he would, give them many
and well-paving fares.
“Our Lord is a man of war,” says someone in the
Old Testament. It is more true of the Japanese.
And in business he is as cute as the vulpine animal
to whom he offers rice cakes and memorial gates. If
he dreams under the wistaria, it is of doing some-
thing—or somebody. He does copy the butterfly—on
the silk kimono. But it is for the foreigner’s wear.
No Japanese over 12 years of age, from the small
tradesmen up to members of the princely houses,
would be found, dead or alive, in butter-flown or
bright-hued garments. A silk in hair lines of steel-
grey and black is the wear for most who can afford
it, and the same pattern in cotton is a geheral
thing., for poorer people. Silk suits are expensive,
which is one of the reasons of the popularity of
European clothes with men. His love of subordina-
tion of color further induces the Japanese to leave
his houses unpainted, consequently his towns are
dingy. But Nature paints the fair country side
exquisitely—mountain, lake and sunset, forest and
flower-gemmed hill. She carves and paints, and the
Japanese, in between military drilling, carves and
paints something to sell the foreigner.
“The Prodigal,” from the mulga country:
Bananaland has some queer townships, and Duar-
inga, 100 miles west of Rockhampton, is one of
them. Being tired or something, it planted its
cemetery within 10yds. of its principal store; and
there is no fence to keep the ghosts in or the
goats out. The goats are the more numerous of tht
two—friendly goats which bite off the daisy which
isn’t planted on little Willie’s grave, and drop a tear
on the gravestone that tells how John Hoggins wa.*
universally respected. Also, the most ancient and
disreputable goat leans his wicked old carcase against
the slab that is alleged to be “sacred to the memory”
of the oldest inhabitant. Yet Duaringa appears to be
a relig’ous hole in its way; and almost every
night effusively pious people parade the streets chant-
ing hymns and giving their “testimonies.”

Ale.
CASCADE ALE, brewed by the Cascade Brewery Co., of Hobart,
is akin to the ale of old England, for it is rich in the qualities that
promote health and strength. That its merits are appreciated by
those most competent to judge is proved by the rapidly-growing sales in
every part of the Commonwealth.
Sold at all first-class hotels and stores.

“Penny wise (Q.
pound foolish!”
WOODWORKING Machines, “low in efficiency,” are usually
installed, owing to the saving effected at first cost.
The fact that a little saving in price may soon be absorbed
by stoppages and breakages seems entirely overlooked.
'
I
m
Tlie cheapest consists in what the
machine is, and what it will do as com-
pared with others.
iSag'ar’s
Woodworking'
Machines
are the Cheapest on the Market,
although not the lowest in first
cost.
In their construction no-
thing is skimped—nothing
half done —no endeavor is
made to turn out a “low-
price” machine.
They are solidly and faithfully
built by British workmen, and
embody the latest ideas for assist-
ing rapid production.
The illustration shows SAGAR’S Chain Cutter and Hollow Chisel
Mortiser, the most practical machine for hand feed.
If you’re interested, ask us to send you Art Catalogue “M 5.” It
deals exclusively with our stock of Woodworking Machines.

THE TRIALS OF TRAVEL.
Do not add to the trials of travel and of everyday life by carrying
( a fountain pen that leaks—that cannot be refilled without a bulb
filler. There is a safer, better way—to carry an Onoto.
The Onoto is the British made fountain pen that
—Fills itself in a flash from any ink supply.
That never leaks and spoils clothes and carpets.
That gives writing satisfaction, gliding smoothly and
speedily over the paper.
It is sold by all stationers, jewellers, stores, etc. And it is worth many
times the price asked— l2/-,
It is only common sense to discard obsolete pens and ways of writing
to go to-day to the nearest stationer’s and say—‘ An Onoto Pen, please.

“O.K.” writes:—
A watchful horse-breeder, with a ready pen, might
produce an interesting booklet dealing with
Maori land racers in Australia, and the different char-
acteristics of horses reared in the two countries,
with incidental remarks on the art of adapting train-
ing systems to climatic conditions. Six years ago,
some champions, from the Maoriland stables of G. G.
Stead and others, were shipped to Sydney for the
Spring meetings, and proved invincible. Noctuiform
won the A..T.C. Derby in record time, and Maniapoto
did the same in the Metropolitan. Next season the
mare Solution put Australia)! fliers into the shade,
Gladsome was a previous revelation from Maoriland ;
and neither of those mares took long to recover from
the change of climate. But, of late, there is a de-
terioration in the average quality of the stuff, or
else the horses from the colder country are less
hardy than of old, or their trainers are less expert.
Lady Medallist, with her brilliant run in the Caul-
field Cup, and Broadsword, with his unexpected cap-
ture of the Doncaster last autumn, suggest that
Maoriland form, at its best, still holds good in Aus-
irnwT t0 A a , “L le and a half - but is not often at
its best. And the representative stavers—what of
them. Lady Lucy, a Maoriland Cup winner, came
to Australia last year, and failed miserably. Her
failure was repeated bv Bridge, her successor on the
M.L. Cup roll. Both of them were said to need time
to get acclimatised, but time seemed only' to dis-
improve them This season, Vice-Admiral, after run-
ning moderately m Sydney, was reshipped to his own
country, where he promptly captured the M.L. Cun
proving that the sea trip is not necessarily a verv
serious interruption to a preparation for a two-mile
race. Evidently, the excuses offered of late years for
Maoriland horses that ran consistent]v badly in Aus-
tralia have been weak apologies for' the animals or
their trainers. Climatic conditions are the same as
when the best form in one country was the best form
in the other, and no long time was required to
demonstrate the fact. Conditions have not altered
since the days when young Carbine was shipped to
Austialia for good, and when Lochiel, after being
sent to win the Newmarket Handicap at Flemington
was returned to Maoriland for a couple of seasons
before being shipped again to Australia to win a lot
more money for the enterprising Mr. Stead. An ex-
haustive essay on Maoriland thoroughbreds and their
peiformances in Australia would probably show cause
why the three latest winners of the Maoriland
Cup have each cut a poor figure in this country,
whilst their snrinting compatriots have been bril-
liant only fitfully.
L J ° T h T n Howell, the big mining man with

on the roof-top of Point Piper, went awav

pected happened a year or so back; so Miss
Adams (whose mother also died while she
was in America) returns this month to marry
Jack Coldham, a Broken Hill mining man—
the boy she d left behind her.

DISEASED KIDNEYS & GRAVEL
Cured After Suffering Three Years.
I IST these days of hurry and bustle, everyone feels over-taxed at times.
Very frequently this feeling is due largely to Kidney Troubles. Any
work which causes constant strain on the back will in time re-act
upon the Kidneys, which are situated just in that part of the back where
most of the strain is felt. That is why so many workers suffer from
Backache.
To obtain relief it is necessary to treat the kidneys with a special
kidney remedy, such as Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills, which act directly upon
those organs, making them healthy and strong, and enabling them to
properly filter and purify the blood, which in turn nourishes and revives
the whole body, and so restores the
system to perfect health.

Mr. ED. SIM MOSS (from, a photo.).
A SYDNEY MAN CURED.
“My husband was a groat sufferer from
diseased kidneys and gravel and a severe pain
in the side for three years,” writes Mrs. Ed.
Simmons, 10 Belmore Street, Ilozelle, N.S.'W.
“lie was so had that he could not sleep, and
he had to stay home from work for a week
now and again. He was quite lop-sided, and
could not stand straight. His face was the
color of death and he had dark rings round
his eyes, lie tried every medicine that he
knew of, and was also under Doctors’ treat-
ment, hut derived no benefit whatever, and
only seemed to be getting worse every day.
One day I noticed an advertisement for Dr.
Sheldon’s Gin Tills, stating they had cured
a case similar to my husband’s, so I per-
suaded him to try them. He got a bottle,
, and, after taking them, the dreadful agony
' got less and less, until it disappeared alto-
gether. That was two years ago, and he has
never suffered with his back since, and keeps
in splendid health.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT never occurred to me in the early
days of our acquaintanceship that
Seager was anything of a genius.
Seager was generally looked upon as a
waster —a waster who had a wealthy father
though. I never yet met a man who could
waste as well as he did. He didn t do it in
liquor or fast living, but I doubt if the
wildest remittance man ever saw the
end of a bank draft as quickly as Seager
did. He had a mania for going into
business, and he had no business capa-
city. When his father sent him out a
decent amount to nut him on his feet, he
bought into a business, and then lost all in-
terest in the undertaking. I think he be-
lieved that it was just a matter ot getting
in and there you were, settled for life and on
a quick way to fortune. There was that
ginger-beer industry, for instance. It was
quite worthless even to the man who sold
it. and Seager never attempted to work
up a connection. Then the tomato-sauce
factory was just a huge mouth that swal-
lowed his £5OO and left him stranded in a
few weeks. The sixpenny restaurant was
an absolute fraud. The vendor didn’t own
it, and three days later the real proprietor
returned from a trip to England and put
Seager out.
The maddest venture Seager ever made
was to turn bookmaker with his last remit-
tance of £lOOO. Seager didn’t know one
horse from another, or a thing about prices,
and he stood up and gave such odds that
he demoralised the field, and everybody
rushed him, to the consternation of the
other pencillers. It might have been all
right for Seager if luck had been dead set
with him, but this was not the case, and
while the last race was being run Seager
had to run too. This occurred at Mait-
land, and many punters may remember the
circumstances. In short, Seager couldn’t
run very well, but fortunately lie could
swim. There was one thing you had to ad-
mire about him—he always came up smiling,
even when wet.
It was just about this time Seager s
father died, and Seager came into the
money, and was a millionaire. As is usual
in these cases, I lost sight of him, and didn’t
hear of him for years. You lend a man tup-
pences and sixpences, and keep him in to-
bacco when he is hard up, and then he sud-
denly knocks oil leaning against you, and
you know that lie has no further use for
you. And he doesn't even pay you back all
that you lent him. .
It was a different Seager I met in George-
street some years later. He used to be
always so well dressed and supercilious, aud
clean-shaven. The new Seager wore shabby
clothes and a ragged beard, and had spec-
tacles instead of pince-nez. I do not know
whether he cultivated this appearance, be-
cause, now he was rich, be had to pay for his
garments, or because it doesn’t matter how a
millionaire dresses. But he was quite
pleased to meet me again, and we had a
laugh over old times.
There was one thing that seemed out ot
place about Seager, and that was a lovely
stone he had set in a scarf-pin. It was
almost too large for a pin, but the color
was indescribably beautiful, and so unusual
in tint that I think there is no name to
describe it. It Hashed with the brilliancy
of a blue diamond. At last I asked him
what sort of stone it was, and he told me
that it was his own make.
“It is the smell of a pole-cat,’’ he said.
I laughed, and he said: “I knew you
would laugh. But it is a fact. I have.been
dabbling a little in experimental chemistry,
and I made a discovery how to turn bad
smells into precious stones, and this is one
of them. Come round to my rooms, and I’ll
show you my collection.”
It was indeed a weird and wonderful col-
lection. I doubt if ever anybody had ever
seen anything like it. Each stone was set
in a velvet case, and all were of a most un-
usual tint, and some so brilliant that they
shed a light on the black velvet about them.
A remarkable stone attracted me more than
the others, and Seager said :
“Yes, that is beautiful. It is the smell of
a rickshaw boy who ran me from Umgeni
into the Town Hall at Durban. I took it
while he was hot. Did you ever see any-
thing as blue?”
“No, never,” I affirmed. . “And here is an-
other beautiful blue stone?”
“That is also the odor of a negro—a
wharf laborer. I got him from the hold of
a vessel at Darling Harbor.” ‘
“What a pretty yellowy-green!” I re-
marked of another stone.
“Yes; that is a Chinaman. Don’t you ob-
serve the curious blending of color? You can
only get this pretty tint from the Chinese.
I've tried the Japanese, but the color is not
as good. I have always observed that the
strongest odors give the most brilliant
colors. This orange stone is a Hindu of
holy orders that I obtained at Bombay.
Strange, too, that it should be more bril-
liant than that of the common Hindu. In
fact, I have noticed repeatedly that you
get brighter tints from religious people than
from sinners.”
“Possibly because sinners have more
vanity, and wash themselves more fre-
quently,” I remarked.
“Exactly,” said Seager. “This dull drab
stone is the odor of an actress, a most beau-
tiful woman, and not too good from all re-
ports. Nobody would look at her now —at
least I mean her precious stone.”
“It is very interesting,” I said. “This
stone here is what you would call elephant’s
breath?” 4
You see, I had been a draper’s assistant,
and knew a little of colors.
“It is elephant’s breath,” said Seager.
“Or rather, I should say, an elephant. This
curious puce color is a common bear. I
have quite a zoo in this collection, and they
are mostly very bright. This stone takes a
lot of wiping out,” he said, pointing to a
variegated bit of brilliance. “That is a
Yiddish old clo’ dealer that I got at Johan-
nesburg.”
“Have you got a Domain dosser?” I
asked.
“No. That is a good suggestion. We
should be able to get a really good color
from him. I’ll advertise. And now come
and I’ll show you my apparatus. It is not
only good for making precious stones, but
it will take out all the germs of sickness
that are in a man. In fact, I propose to
live to the age of Methuselah.”
The machine looked just like a large
gramophone. It was a box with a big
funnel attached, and at the end of the fun-
nel a room big enough to hold an elephant.
“Take my odor,” 1 asked.
“(let inside,” he said.
I cannot describe the lovely sensation
that came over me when I was shut inside
the room of the machine a few minutes. 1
heard a whirring as if some cylinder were
revolving rapidly, and then a blissfully
dreamy sensation began to overcome me. i
didn’t care what happened. Then feeager
opened the door. I felt quite annoyed, and
asked him why lie didn’t let me stay longer.
“I'ou have been in an hour already. It is
not safe to stay in too long. Well, did you
like itV How do you feel now?”
“I feel simply splendid. Never felt better
in all my life. I feel as if I could jump over
a three-railed fence.”
“Better than taking medicine, he re-
marked. “I don’t think there is an impurity
in you now.” _
“Let me see the precious stone.” _
“Oh, there is no stone,” he said. “You
were not in long enough.”
“Put me in again,” I said. “I’d give any-
thing to get a precious stone out of myself.”
Seager looked troubled, but shook himself
together, and said : “No, no,” as if he were
lighting an inclination.
“Let’s go and put an advertisement in the
Herald,” he said suddenly.
You never saw such a sight as there was
in front of Seager’s rooms next day. All
the dossers in Sydney had turned up. It is
not often these are advertised for. We
picked out the man who seemed likely to
give the best results. The rest hung about
the place and became a nuisance till nearly
11 o’clock, when they disappeared most un-
accountablyl—till you remembered the coun-
ter luncheons.
Our specimen was willing to do anything
for the sovereign, and as many beers as he
wanted. Seager put the sovereign on the
shelf, and told mm that it was his when he
came out. Poor fellow, he didn’t know what
was about to occur in the big box at the
end of the funnel. We tried to make him
get up a perspiration before he went in, but
it was no use, and Seager said that it was
just as well; the stone might not be quite so
brilliant, but it would be a truer specimen.
In an hour I asked Seager if it was not
time to let him out, and he said no. I said
that it was not safe to leave him in too
long, and Seager became quite irritable, and
told me to mind my own business. After
that I made no suggestion. You can usually
tell what not to say to another man.
At 10 that night Seager pulled out a
little drawer at the bottom of the small box
where the apparatus was, and I must say
that I never did see such a lovely stone. It
was cerise and blue.
“The fellow inside must be getting
hungry,” I said to Seager.
Seager threw open the door. There was
nobody inside, only a few old clothes —old
clothes that had been greasy, but were now
quite sweet and clean.
“Where is he?” I asked.
Seager pointed to the stone.
1 confess I felt horrified for a second or
two, but you could not look at that gem
without having your admiration overcome
all other emotions.
“You will give me that stone?” I asked.
“I would like to get it set for a scarf-pin.”
“Give it to you!” cried Seager. “Why,
you do not know what you are asking for,
man. It is worth thousands.”
“It cost you nothing.”
“Do you know what that machine cost
me? There is a cylinder of radium inside
that I paid £500,000 for, and it cost double
that to buy it, as I had to manipulate the
market to get in. In fact, radium had to
be cornered. There’s not much fear that you
are going to get one of my precious stones !
I travel all over the world to get unique
specimens, and I suppose you think that
doesn't cost me anything?”
“Well, look here, Seager,” I said, getting
wild; “I suppose you don’t mind me telling
you what I think of you. You are no class.
You were always a waster, and you are no
better now, in spite of your riches. And
you have no gratitude in you. I suppose
you forget all the pipes of tobacco I gave
you when you hadn’t the price of a plug of
tobacco on you?”
A sneer came over Seager’s face, and he
said : “You seem to forget, old man, that I
used to take you into partnersnip every time
I started in business.”
“And nice partnerships they were,” I
said. “I’m not likely to forget that Mait-
land affair in a hurry. I don’t want to
throw things up at you; but, supposing I
was to go to the police and say that I know
a man who is murdering people just to see
their odors, what then?”
“They are not dead,” said Seager, point-
ing to his precious stones. “They are all
just as much alive as you are. They are
merely transformed. And, anyway, the
police would only laugh at you. Who would
believe it possible?”
“All the same,” I said, “you are a cold-
hearted murderer, and when I think of these
poor people sacrificed for a selfish hobby, I
have nothing but loathing for you. You
ought to be lynched. I will go now, because
I might say something I would be sorry for.”
And I left.
The more I thought of it the more I
loathed Seager. It was quite true that I
would be only laughed at if I carried the
story to the police. It was clear that I
could prove nothing unless I could produce
a corpse. “What an awful man this Seager
must be!” I said to myself. “If he has an
enemy all he has to do is to coax him into
the big box, and afterwards wear him on his
finger. And how could you sheet home the
crime? I would give five shillings to get
even with him.”
There was not much sleep for me these
nights. I lay awake and planned and
planned until I solved the question and dis-
covered how I could undo the wrong Seager
had done.
Next day I spent a half-crown at the
chemist’s, and that night when all was quiet
I broke into Seager’s rooms and put my
scheme into execution. I commenced to pour
the liquid on to the stones —it was eau-de-
cologne. The effect on tne bright gems was
marvellous. I had thought of the real anti-
dote. The odors began to materialise. I
could see them form as vapors, and gradu-
ally solidify till before me stood Turks,
Armenians, Chinamen, Japanese, Zulus, an
elephant; a common bear, a menagerie lion,
a few jackals, and various animals with
quick and violent smells. The stench in that
small room was something fearful. I felt
too overcome to get out of it. The elephant,
which was almost fainting, made a rush and

are realising to-day that a handy pot of Zam-Buk is a priceless boon.
Zam-Buk is not only world-famous for its healing, soothing and
-destroying qualities, but gives us for the first time an ever ready
‘first-aid, ” uniting simplicity, effectiveness and safety
Simplicity. Because it requires no previous preparation, needs
simply to be taken out of the pot with the clean
finger-end and rubbed gently over the cut or sore, when the fine herbal juices
sink into the tiny pores in the skin and “get at” the harmful germs that
are lodging in the under-tissues.
Effective. Because Zam-Buk is prepared by methods entirely dif-
ferent and ahead of mere oint-
ments and cheap salves or “creams.” Because it
is composed of pure gums, juices and aromatic oils,
scientifically refined and skilfully combined. The
uniform success of Zam-Buk shows that the ideally
effective balm has been discovered at last.
Safe. Because Zam-Buk’s active constituents con-
——— tain no trace of rancid animal fat, mineral
irritant or poisonous acid. Because Zam-Buk achieves its
exceptional results by methods quite different from fatty
ointments and cheap salves. Zam-Buk is
so pure that it suits the frailest invalid and
the youngest babe. It is the one and only
Zam-Buk, as sold in sealed packages.
Paily mishaps make Zam-Buk a
daily need ; and its instant applica-
tion on cut, spyain or sore is a sure
safeguard against blood-poisoning
germ diseases and all the common
complications of accidents and skin
diseases.
A MOTHER PRAISES ZAM-BUK,
Mrs. S. M. Burgess, of 34 Cambridge
Street, Rozeile, Sydney, says:—“For
such injuries as cuts, abrasions and
festered sores, and for children who are
always falling and hurting themselves,
Zam-Buk should be kept on a handy shelf
in every home. For chapped hands and
cracked lips caused by the bitter, winter
winds, Zam-Buk is a splendid remedy.”

and the smaller animals followed. The men
who had materialised looked round for
trouble, and seeing the machine which had
petrmed them, they started in to demolish it.
J-hei noise of wrecking brought along Seager
in his pyjamas. They no sooner saw him
than they set on him.
I thought: “This man is just getting his
deserts, and 111 not interfere. I’ll just wait
and secure the cerise and blue stone which

ROBERT BROTHERS.
Bullocky Bill.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bullock-driving is not the sort
of calling that the average man
hankers after; the average man, in
fact, considers it one of the worst that he
could be asked to take up. But to the
veteran ox-conductor there is no grander
thing on earth than his waggon, and a
spanking team of 36 bullocks. It is all to
him that a fine ship is to a navigator.
Like ships, each waggon bears a name
fancifully painted on the sides. Some I
have met with are: “Margaret Catchpole,”
Gipsy Queen,” “Currency Lass,” “The
Never Get Stuck,” “Dancing Girl,” “Sarah
Bernhardt,” “Rose of Beauty,” “Flirt,”
Marie Corelli,” “Mary Ah Foo ” and “The
Lulo Queen.” There are “Freetraders,”
Trotectionists,” “Democrats,” “Republi-
cans,” “Patriots ” and “Home Rules”
wheeling about in dozens; also, “Wombats,”
Wallabies,” “Brumbies” and other animals.
One happens upon peculiarities, at times, in
bullock nomenclature. One teamster called
Ins pets Villain, Rascal, Vagabond, Scoun-
drel, Demon, Vampire, Monster, etc.; and
another’s team was named after prominent
politicians, with Barton and Kingston in
the pole, and Reid and Lyne in the lead.
Occasionally one meets a team composed of
all Devons (red), or all Ilerefords, or all
spotted bullocks. I saw one all-black team ;
"“t * never met an all-white turn-out.
White is an off-color with Bullocky Bill.
While smoking a pipe in a bullocky’s
camp one evening the conversation turned
on Tattersall’s sweeps, and I asked Bill
what he would do if he had the luck to
draw a big prize.
‘‘l’d ’ave one glorious drunk,” he said.
Only a month, though,” he added quickly.
A month satisfies me at any time. Then
I'd get a real clinkin’ new tabletop, with
broad tyres, that ’ud carry 25 ton. I’d ’ave
it made to order. I’ve got it all specified
an drawed out, an’ it’s runnin’ beautiful —
m my mind. All spick an’ span. I’ll lay it
ud take a bend outer some o’ those carrion
choppers out ’ere.”
“What would you do?” I asked, turning
to another man.
, “I’d ’ave the best bloomin’ team this side
o Bourke,” said Bill’s mate in a burst of
confidence.
Punching is the mainspring of Bullocky
Bill’s existence, and he could hardly be
happy if released from the thraldom df the
yoke. In the team all his interests are
centred ; there his ambition begins and ends.
To carry a bigger load than anyone else, or
to do a trip in record time, is fame. To
possess a bullock that can pull any other
bullock on the road covers him with glory,
and perpetuates his name and the name of
Strawberry among the fraternity, genera-
tion after generation. They will tell you
where that quadruped was calved, how he
was bought and broken in, what roads he
worked on, how he died, and where his
bones are resting.
Bill can talk bullock to you for a week at
a stretch, dilating on the merits of Strag-
gler, and on the skull-dragging propensities
of old Brindle ; and on the fashions of yokes,
chains, bows and other jewellery; on the re-
spective merits of black myrtle and kindred
woods for whip handles, and the marvellous
things that can be done with a whip. Green-
hide Jack, for instance, never used an axe
on barren roads, but fed his stock by whip-
ping showers of leaves from the trees. He
could pick up a sixpence nine times out of
ten with a whipthong; and he flogged his
name, as neatly as a man could carve it, on
the trees in passing. He particularises Ms
team from polers to leaders; how Rowdy
and Ball stop dead, and will stand dragging
at- the call of “Whey,” and will steady a
whg£on down any hill without chain or
brake; how Spot handles the steer, shoving
him off, and lugging him to; and how Star-
light is the devil’s own for turnipg his yoke.
He gives you novel ways of starting a sulky
bullock —making a fire under him, pounding
his ribs with a shovel, or rubbing a stick
smartly backwards and forwards on his
tail; and he has equally effective methods
of dealing with the skull-dragger, and the
beast that is always getting his splay foot
over the chain.
I innocently gave my ear one day to
Crooked Mick as he reclined lazily on a bale
of wool, waiting for a load at a border sta-
tion. He started at 9 a.m. to tell me his ex-
periences down the track in yoking up a re-
fractory team. When we adjourned for
lunch he had one bullock, named Bismarck,
yoked, and was bringing back his mate,
Rattler, across a mulga paddock for the
forty-eleventh time. He got him bowed and
keyed during the meal, but had forgotten
the coggles. He was searching for them
about the yard when I left the table. Mick
always made for me afterwards while he
remained at the shed, to edify me with the
yoking of the other 14, but I suddenly re-
membered urgent engagements elsewhere.
On the dry bush tracks, with their fre-
quent intermissions of heavy sand and stony
hills, between Bourke and the Queensland
border, the bullock-driver has a hard time.
A long day through blistering heat, flies and
dust; then a ride back with tired bullocks,
eight or ten miles, to the last water; and to-
morrow a long night ride ahead to the next
water. There he camps for the night, get-
ting back to the waggons about sunrise next
morning. There is often no grass or herb-
age, and, after taking his cattle to water, he
has to cut scrub to feed them. One can
hardly blame Bill if he helps himself to a
nip from the tempting consignment of hotel
goods he has on board. He has many in-
genious ways of accomplishing this. One of
the hoops on the beer cask is knocked up
the least bit, and a small hole bored through
the side. This is afterwards plugged with
deal, and concealed by replacing the hoop.
The rum or brandy cask is managed in an-
other way. A couple of quarts of boiling-
water are poured on top, and left there all
night. In the morning it is strong enough
to. make the hardiest bullocky drunk if lie
drinks enough of it. Again, when the worn-
out feels the need of a reviver
in the shape of a glass of whisky, one is
inclined to excuse him when he lets some
heavy weight drop—accidentally, of course
—on the whisky case, and smashes a bottle.
It is only natural, and in accordance with
the law of economics, that he should catch
the flowing spirit in his billy, and drink
“better luck” to the rest of the consignment.
Many teamsters on the western tracks are
hound to time, and in making up for some
unforeseen delay the cattle suffer, and not
infrequently several head are left by the
roadside to die. There is a stiff penalty for
dilatoriness, ranging up to fl per day.
Sometimes the drivers are docked so much
per ton for every day over contract time.
On these roads grass and water are pre-
cious, and very often a good night for the
team is not to be had for love or money.
Still, the team must eat and drink to get
the load through; so the teamster has to
battle for it, and the cunning begotten of
ions- experience on the roads is set against
the watchfulness of the landowner. The bul-
locks are taken quietly to the tank at night
—not to the one near which the teams may
be camped, but to one several miles distant.
Then the wires are strapped down, and the
hungry animals are slipped in where the
feed is best, and left till nearly daylight,
one of the men sleeping in the paddock with
them. Perhaps only half the team will be
thus treated at a time, the other half being
left on neutral ground, carrying all the
available bells to mislead the enemy. The
lot that are being treated to refreshments
are severely reproved if they only cough or
sneeze.
I knew a teamster to camp one night in a
lane where there was an excavated tank on
each side of him. About midnight two boys,
carrying a far-sounding bell in each hand,
walked across to one tank, and the tolling of
the bells—made to resemble a belled bullock
walking—soon broug-ht out the owner and his
assistant. The boys sought cover while the
deluded pair rode round; and when they
were leaving the neighborhood, one bell
rang out violently, as when a camping bul-
lock shakes its head. Back came the
searchers, and another hour was wasted in
beating about among the bushes. By this
time the old man had watered the bullocks
at the other tank, brought them back into
the lane, and turned in with his face
wreathed in smiles.
One hears a good deal about lucky and
unlucky trips; but the luck or otherwise
of a trip depends greatly on the manage-
ment and general ability of the man. Some
men go up and down the roads, year after
year, . with the regularity of clockwork,
breaking records in time and weight-carry-
ing, and with scarcely a mishap. Some have
their bullocks always in good condition,
sleek, fine-looking animals, tried and true—
not a waster in the team. Others, on the
same roads, have hungry, miserable, hunted-
looking beasts, generally criss-crossed from
head to tail with whipmarks. They get
stuck at every little ant-hill and in every
little gutter; and, after a considerable ex-
penditure of energy and strong language,
often have to double bank, or, failing that,
throw off part of the load and dig their way
out. When a man has to cut away the hills,
and ease the gradients at creeks with pick
and shovel, besides removing a good deal of
the first strata off soft flats, there isn’t much
in carrying. I saw a carrier start one even-
ing from a shed with 11 tons of wool on. He 1
hadn’t gone half a mile when he capsized;
and he spent the best part of next day right-
ing his waggon and loading up again. He had
an extraordinary run of misfortunes, and
the first load of the following year’s clip
was on the road before he reached his des-
tination, 200 miles away.
Some men are naturally cruel, and even
go to the extent (though this is very rare)
of lighting a fire under a stubborn animal.
I remember one such case, and it was a
peculiar instance of a bullock turning the
tables on the driver. It occurred some years
ago on a western track. One of the pin bul-
locks had lain down, and all other means
failing to shift him, the man with the whip
lit a fire under his middle. When it began
to burn well the jibber jumped up and put
his shoulder to the yoke with great energy,
and, assisted by his mate and the polers,
pulled on just far enough to leave the wag-
gon fairly over the fire. The smile that had
momentarily played on the driver’s face died
suddenly; he rushed forward with dilating
eyes, lashed with the whip, belted with the
handle, yelled, screeched and howled ; but the
whole team had gone on strike. The wag-
gon, loaded with inflammable material,
caught fire, and was very quickly reduced
to cinders, while a shrieking contortionist
contorted by, and bestowed on each bullock
a new name as long as three-bar chains.
The Queensland bullockies are generally
in better fettle than those of New South
Wales and Victoria, having the main roads
yet very much in their own hands. There
they take their families and their fowls and
goats with them on their far-inland trips. I
happened upon a camp of them once in a
bend of the Ward River, spelling on good
feed. There were eight teams; each man
had his wife and children, his herd of
goats, and his coop of poultry, so that the
place resembled a prosperous farm yard.
The women clustered under trees in the cool
of the evening, the men reclined by the wag-
gons, all swapping yarns and experiences
concerning bullocks; whilst the bare-legged
children yelled and gambolled about the
billabongs. Through the day they fished and
shot ducks, and gathered emu eggs, game
being plentiful in that neighborhood. When
•travelling, the missus sat on top of the load,
or drove behind in a tilted cart; the children
some mounted, some walking—drove the
goats and spare oxen; while the coops
swung under the tails of the waggons. On
reaching camp the fowls were let out to
chase the unwary grasshopper, and disport
themselves in the bush until all was ready
to trek next morning.
Under such conditions Bullocky Bill gets
a fair share of pleasure out of life. Every
camp is home; and when the day’s work is
done the voices of his wife and little ones
add cheermess to the camp-fire’s blaze.

The above clearly shows Results from a Short Course of my True Halr*Growing Compound.
10,000 FREE TRIAL
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time —yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, I fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This led him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wroteVout a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
Compound prepared. I did this a few days later. I
was astonished to see the hair coming fotth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered.by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair.
Since thep the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. Ido not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world —I am
not interested in decrying others—but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far
the cheapest.
