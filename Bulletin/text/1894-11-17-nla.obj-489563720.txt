American Authors.
One does not forget Cooper and Hawthorne, Bret Harte and Howells, in
wondering when America is going to produce a first-rank novelist. Poets she has—
essayists, scientists, orators, historians—who may compare with all but the highest
names in old-world literature; but her Thackeray, her Balzac, her Tolstoi, are still
to seek. There seems to be something lacking in the American brain or the Ameri-
can environment, though with such a mingling of rich blood, such a variety of
climate, and such a teeming panorama of effort and incident, their chances would
appear rather in favor of a fuller, stronger intellectual life than is found else-
where. So far, American culture tends to width rather than depth.
Interest in books and writers is more widely diffused in America than in
England, for example; and the humblest American newspapers exhibit a literary
agility and originality which, however ridiculous in extremes, are yet preferable to
the comatose parochialism of most English journals outside the centres of population.
But the power of specialisation and concentration seems wanting to American
writers of fiction. They have no back to their heads. They soar high for short
flights, but lack the strength of pinion for sustained struggle. Conceive what memor-
able fruit might be borne were the method of Zola applied in a study of American
life and character—its miseries, its splendours, its industrial strifes, its ferocious
whirl of politics, its stern subjugation of natural forces ! But where is the American-
Zola —gifted not only with the mind to plan such a task, but also with the tenacity
and industry to complete it ? West, east, centre, north and south, one calls vainly
for an answer. Yet American fictionists have their field of special merit, though it
be not on the highest plane of genius. They are beautiful bellettrists, masters of the
short story, which they have lifted to a pitch of dainty delightfulness only reached in
France beside. Their critical novelists of the neo-realistic school, like Howell and J ames,
if refined to the point of weakness, are invariably graceful and witty. Most of the
authors collected below are artists in words whose style has the delicate savour of a
pothouse flower, and who treat their themes with the sympathy and imagination of
a poet.
This series (David Douglas’ series of American authors) is charmingly printed;
and the books are small and compact, suitable for the pocket. Posted at Is. 3d.

’Gainst mania, crime and taint

But poverty—must that be branded now ?
Twere easy, with the rest,

On form and terms of it;

Which carves o’er wide sea-gates—

The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil

Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis
tinctive Australian National Policy,
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.

A United Australia and Protection against

The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility. ’
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless hews paper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent soraf
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the olahns of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
oblonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.-

Tanko Creek Incident.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The parson came to Gungamine, which i* on
Yanko Creek,
With tidings of damnation for the sinners
gathered there,
The rouseabouts and shearers —and his game was,
so to speak,
To put the fear of Hell in them with preaching
and with prayer.
Maconochie, of Gungamine, a pious man was he,
He rounded up his station hands to hear the
parson spout.
Amongst them there were men who ne’er in prayer
had bended knee ;
But “ down upon your marrow-bones ” it was,
or else —“ get out!”
The parson preached, the parson prayed, his
prayers were deep and loud.
Maconochie at fitting times responsive groaned
“Amen!”
But silence like a gravestone lay upon the kneeling
crowd :
Some softly chewed tobacco and some spat
around —and then —
Maconochie, of Gungamine, rose swiftly from his
knees;
His face was red with righteous rage as he those
sinners scanned.
He shouted “You may go to H 1 your own
way if you please—
But, d n your eyes, you might have giv n
the blanky man a hand !”

In Austral Light for Nov., Rev. J. J.
Malone reminds us in “ The Australian Poet:
Henry Kendall,” that neither Gordon nor Stephens
is Australian by birth. His keynote of criticism
is that “ Kendall is a poet who owes to Australia
everything except his poetry” :
No poet can claim to be a true interpreter of the natural
features of this primeval land who does not succeed in
transfusing the oppressive stillness and brooding melan-
choly of the lonely bush into his poetry. Kendall has
succeeded in doing that with more fidelity, with greater
vividness and power, than either Gordon or Brunton

A Maoriland correspondent to The Bul-
letin
The stagnation here is a reactionary result of late com-
parative prosperity. Enterprise is dead, and shopkeepers
are inordinately querulous about credit. There are
many unemployed, but, as they are not centralised, the
outcry is not extreme. The depression is keen, all the
same. Large firms are discharging their hands by scores,
and men who have been securely placed for years are
eyeing their situations anxiously. The Ministry reap all
the blame, whether culpable or not. Premier Seddon
devoutly wishes for a Maoriland Coolgardie, and inclines
to a boom policy. He has lost much in popular esteem,
and, compared with Ballance, is an utter failure. Were
it not for Treas. Ward, the Ministry would be consistently
wild cat. Ward is the sheet-anchor, and is the only level-
head of the crowd.

A Maoriland (male) correspondent sends
the following soul-wail re Miss Nannie Harding,
the charming little actress, late of Sydney
Lyceum:—
You sav : “ Miss Harding is a Welshwoman, of which
she is peculiarly proud.” Why 1 Why should a woman
be proud of something she can t help? She might as
well be proud of big feet, corns, freckles, or a pug nose,
lust because they were hers. The Welsh peoples vanity
is so phenomenal that they think the obscure corner that
accidentally saw their first blind, helpless struggles and
re-echoed to their mewlings is honored above all other
■not* on earth. The man who wrote the par. is as great
a'fool as the woman. I could understand that “ Cow Fat
is a native of China, of which he is intensely proud, for
one don’t expect much manners of a Chinaman, who,
from a national point of view, thinks all foreigners dirt.
The tars on H.M.S. Pinafore were also proud of being
Englishmen,-but they knew no better, and their ignor-
ance is held up for the laughter of the world ; but tor the
all-wise Bulletin to chronicle such a thing is too much.
And to be proud of being Welsh, above all things, shows
the lady to be easily proud, for, to sum it up in a few
words, Wales is the smallest country with the smallest
people, both mentally and physically in the world ; where
ignorance is national, and which your friend, even
Brigand Stanley, was ashamed of as a birthplace.
A good deal of this is sound logic, and only goes
to show what a fool of a thing logic is. By the
same process of reasoning the above infuriated
correspondent has no right to be proud that he is
a man and not a horse, because he didn t attain
the dignity of a human being by any effort of his
own; therefore, if anybody calls him a man he
lias no reason to feel proud, and if anyone calls
him a horse he has no cause to feel offended, xne
fact that he doubtless would feel offended only
shows that he is the same kind of an ass as any-
body else. Logically, no doubt, nobody has any
right to feel proud concerning his country, or his
lineage, or his name, or his general personal
appearance, because he didn’t make any of them ;
nevertheless if he didn’t feel proud no country
would amount to much, and almost everybody
would' be named Smith or Hogg or something
unpleasant, and the human race would be even
more blotched and freckled, and more troubled
with ingrowing nails and untidy hair than it is.
Logic is a great institution, no doubt, but a
strictly logical world wouldn’t be worth living in,
all the same. , •

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1894.
A State Grog-Department.
The fact that Australians, in common with
the rest of humanity, drink too much is so
universally admitted that further argument
on that branch of the drink question is un-
necessary. The additional fact that they
drink many curious and horrible compounds,
and are inwardly corroded by all manner of
gruesome and muddy adulterants, is also a
matter which is too well-known to require
demonstration. The strange acids and
alkalis which find their way into the alcohol
of this country, and into the inner economy
of its inhabitants, the weird drugs and
chemicals, the dirt and coloring matters, the
tobacco-juice, vitriol, white spirit, burnt
sugar, salt, essences and perfumes, the things
that are used to make one gallon—or some-
times no gallon at all--of genuine liquor do
the duty of four, the things that are em-
ployed to give it an artificial “bead,” or a
sparkle, or a “ head,” to stir it tip when it
is flat or to tone it down when the taste of
some particular horror is too conspicuous, all
read like the story of some nightmare
brewed in a cauldron by a witch of the
olden time. What the effect of these
adulterants is upon the aggregate constitu-
tion can only be vaguely estimated, for there
are no comparative statistics available ; there
was no period in history when the Australian
drank pure liquor, so how differently the
mortality and insanity and other returns
would read if he did drink pure liquor is
largely a matter for conjecture. The one
thing that is reasonably certain is that they
would read differently. Meanwhile, the
law makes feeble efforts to purify the national
drinks by sending round an officer at long
intervals to buy samples from the retailer
and have them analysed, and if they won't
stand analysis a fine is imposed on the
miserable publican, and thereafter business
proceeds much as usual.
* * •
The precautions taken against the sale of
poisonous liquor are inefficient for many
reasons. They apply mainly, in an absurdly
spasmodic and ineffectual way, in the cities
and provincial towns ; the remote coun-
try shanties, where the liquor horror as-
sumes its worst form, are little visited.
The publican, in many instances, knows
or suspects his visitor, and only sells
him samples which can bear inspection.
The law deals only with cases of actual
adulteration, and all manner of bad and
unwholesome liquors get through simply
because they are not actually adulterated.
And, above all, the law is ineffective because
—in New South Wales at all events —it deals
only with the retail drink-seller. In that
land of anomalies, any kind of drink, no
matter hew nefarious, may, in 999 cases out
of 1000, be imported with absolute impunity;
and the wholesale merchant may sell it to
the retailer without any questions being
asked. Then when it is found in the re-
tailer’s possession the law assumes that the
adulteration must of necessity have been
effected by him, and acts accordingly. The
law is perfectly aware that, in many cases,
this a sumption is wholly erroneous. It
is a matter of ' notoriety that large
quantities of spirits which are refused
admission at other ports, on the ground that
they are unfit for human consumption, are
sent on to Sydney and landed there without
the slightest hindrance. The Government,
not long since, formally admitted this fact
by proposing to introduce a bill according to
which no imported liquor should be issued
from bond unless it was certified, after
official examination, to be fit for human con-
sumption. And the Collector of Customs
further admitted it by protesting against the
proposed measure, on the ground that it
would be “ a harsh interference with trade.”
Therefore, the State officers are aware, by
their own acknowledgment, that New South
Wales receives from abroad quantities of
liquor unfit for human use, and yet
it allows this liquor to be imported and
sold to the publican with impunity, and
contents itself with fining that miserable
scapegoat, and endorsing his licence, when
he unconsciously or carelessly buys the com-
pound and passes it on to the consumer.
* * #
The attitude of the Collector of Customs
in this matter indicates a curious mental
condition on the part of that official. The
Government proposal would only have the
effect of interfering with the trade in bad
liquor; the trade in good liquor would
be materially helped by it, partly because
the Government certificate would be a guar-
antee as to quality, and partly because the
honest trader would be protected from the
unfair competition of nefarious alcohol im-
ported at almost nominal prices. Therefore,
it is the trade in liquor that is unfit to drink
which would be harshly interfered with, and
the officer who considers that such a trade
shouldn’t be harshly interfered with is in a
remarkable state of mind. Moreover, the
law already interferes much more harshly
with the same trade so far as concerns the
retail branch of it, and why the original
offender should go free while the secondary
one is heavily punished passes comprehen-
sion. The Bulletin presumes that the
Collector of Customs is a sound Freetrader.
• * «
Even, however, if the Government pro-
posal is carried out, which seems decidedly
improbable, it will only touch the outermost
fringe of the evil. It will leave the supervision
of the retail adulterator as inefficient as ever.
It will do nothing whatever to check the
local manufacture of illicit drink, mostly of
the worst quality, or to improve the local
article, which is not illicit but simply un-
wholesome. Also, it will leave untouched
all the other ill features of the trade—the
vast number of superfluous “ hotelsthe
brutal ex-pugilists and broken-down “sports”
who take to hotel-keeping in their old age
for want of any other refuge ; the dingy,
dirty, unkempt establishments which are
partly brothels and partly dens of thieves ;
and the necessity, arising from excessive
competition, to do everything possible to
create an artificial thirst in a community
which is already much too thirsty by nature,
and to establish an artificial demand where
there is already far more demand than
enough. The most careful and efficient
supervision of the quality of the liquor sold
will leave all these matters untouched,
and there is no visible remedy for them
save by making the drink traffic in
all its branches importing and manu-
facturing, wholesale and retail a State
monopoly. Other measures, no matter how
stringent, can only palliate one evil at a time
and can only do that feebly and indecisively.
The nationalisation of the drink traffic is the
one device which will deal effectively with
all the aspects of the problem at once.
• * 9
The public accepts new ideas slowly and
reluctantly, and to make it begin to consider
them seriously, or even to make it begin to
realise that there are such ideas in existence,
it is necessary to present them over and over
again, in all manner of forms, and with per-
sistent reiteration. Therefore, The Bul-
letin makes no apology for defining once
more the case for a State Drink Department,
and will make no apology for defining it
several hundred more times in the future.
Under State management only sufficient
bars would be maintained to meet the
public demand, whereas, according to the
present system, they are as many as
can contrive to make a living for their
owners, said living being often eked out
by all manner of immoral devices. Under
these circumstances the number of bars
would probably be reduced by one-half or
more. The bar-keepers would be Civil
servants and persons of good character ; the
respectable employees at present in the trade
would mostly find work under the new
regime, but a clean sweep would be made of
all the broken - nosed pugilists, jockeys,
spielers, drunkards, and women of loose
character who form a large percentage of
the drink-selling community. All the bars
attached to first - class hotels would be
taken over by the State at a rental based
upon a fixed percentage of the profits,
and in those localities where no respectable
bars existed, clean and commodious saloons
would be opened ; but all the dingy, unclean,
ugly and unsavoury little dens, with which
the slums of every Australian city and the
remoter regions of the bush are profusely
dotted, would be entirely wiped out.
* * *
The State would be the sole brewer, dis-
tiller and importer, and would sell no liquor
except after strict analysis. Therefore the
trade in poisonous grog, which eats away the
brains and the intestines and drives the
customer to death or idiocy or homicidal
frenzy, would come to a sudden end. So,
also, would the business of illicit distillation,
except on a microscopic scale, for the
abolition of the private publican would
practically close the market for uncustomed
alcohol. Fully half the persons who now
live by this unproductive trade in its
various branches—importers, wholesale mer-
chants, clerks, salesmen, travellers, publi-
cans and their hangers-on, excise officers,
and others—could be dispensed with, and
every means whereby the unproductive classes
of the community are diminished adds to the
aggregate wealth of the nation. Further,
the consumption of drink, under the pro-
posed conditions, would be vastly reduced,
for the Government servant, being a salaried
official, would have no inducement to push
trade, and would merely meet the demand
without attempting to create one. And, in
addition to all these things, the revenue to
be derived from a Government drink mono-
poly would be an enormous assistance to the
depleted treasuries of Australia, at a time
when the old sources of incomes are in a bad
way and new ones are hard to find, and woe-
fully disappointing even when they are
found.
* * •
The teetotal faction is, and is likely to be,
the worst obstacle in the way of an effectual
reform of the drink traffic. All the evils
which have attached themselves to the trade
without being in any sense a part of it—the
immense superfluity of hotels, the low
character of many publicans, the nefarious
quality of the liquor sold, the dirt, the
gambling, the immorality, the trade in illicit
spirits, the “ lambing-down ” which is prac-
tised in bush shanties, the frowsy houri of
the bar, the blotched and bloated bar-
keeper, and all the rest of the ugliness and
moral and physical unsavouriness of the
business —form the greater part of the
teetotal fanatic’s stock-in-trade. It is on the
gratuitous assumption that these things are
all essential parts of the liquor business that
he bases his demand for total Prohibition,
and the establishment of the trade upon a
footing from which all these unwholesome
elements were excluded would practically
destroy the branch of eloquence by which he
makes his livelihood. But the nation at
large, which does not earn its salary by
hoarse fulrainations against alcohol, has to
consider things as they are. The present
system of badly supervised drink-shops is
bad. The Prohibition system, which means
as many or more drink-shops under no
supervision at all, is worse. And the only
visible remedy is a State monopoly, which
will make the supervision constant, effective,
and practically automatic, and abolish all
inducements to evil practices by making the
drink-seller a public servant whose salary
depends upon good behavior, instead of a
private speculator carrying on business for
his own profit.
“ My Relation, the Judge.”
Purity of justice is invaluable. A Judge
has always a difficult part to play—a part for
which divinity itself would be none too
perfect. Yet a Judge is but a man—with a
man’s passions, a man’s foibles, a man’s
nature. Therefore, we do our best, by
tempting his manhood, to make him a bad
Judge.
* * •
There is force in family relationship.
“Blood is thicker than water,” says the
proverb. A man is naturally drawn to his
own kith and kin. Therefore, in ordinary
life, we do not attempt to outrage nature.
Sportsmen will not choose as judge in their
contests the relation of one of the com-
petitors. Business men will not choose as
umpire in an arbitration the relation of one
of the disputants. But, when we leave the
field of sport and business—matters of
limited social importance— and enter the
arena of Justice—a thing of permanent
national importance —then we say: “Let
justice be a family affair. Here nature may
be outraged with impunity.”
* * *
To a Judge, money is a comparative trifle.
His mind is large enough to spurn the folly
of amassing wealth for wealth’s sake. He is
paid a high salary; he has, even if stricken
by paralysis two minutes after his appoint-
ment, a large life pension ; his future i s
secure. Yet, when he is asked to decide a
case in which he has the remotest money
interest, he descends from the Bench. “ The
er “ in f °l, Ju ® tice ’” he sa y s > “is easily
sullied. She should avoid even the appear-
ance of evil.” Good. And when the same
Judge is asked to decide a case with which
the life-success of his son, or his daughter’s
husband, or his brother's son, is or may be
intimately concerned, he stays on the Bench
He may be influenced by money, you see •
but he is proof against fatherhood or friend-
ship. Good,
• * *
The law has many branches. A lawyer
may choose to be a solicitor or barrister to
begin with. A barrister, he reflects,’ i s
brought most closely into contact with’the
Judges. He becomes a barrister. Then he
may choose in which of several Courts he
will chiefly practise. He chooses the Court
in which he thinks he will most speedily
obtain professional advancement. In N.S. W
there are four barristers who have chosen
each to practise chiefly in a Court over which
a blood-relation presides. Four —related to
several different Judges, and each practising
before the Judge to whom he is related”
What but the hope of turning relationship to
professional account guided this singularly
unanimous choice 1 These barristers rely, as
we all rely, on reasoning based on accumu-
lated human experience. “Blood is thicker
than water.”
* * •
It is unusual for a barrister to succeed in
his profession from the outset. He often
waits a long time before he meets the golden
shower of guineas. In New South Wales
there are eight barristers closely related
to six Judges. These eight have all suc-
ceeded from the outset, leaving far behind
them in the race their competitors of equal
standing, of equal ability. If such friend-
ship of solicitors is not due to the knowledge
that relationship counts for something in the
battle of the briefs, to what is it due 1
* * *
Law is not an exact science; it leaves always
loopholes for disagreement. Sometimes the
merits of a case are so nicely balanced that
the best judge is unable to fully convince
himself on which side justice lies. At such
times a feather will turn his mental scale.
Would the unconscious harmony of relation-
ship be such a feather ? It is likely. “ Iron
sharpeneth iron ; so a man sharpeneth the
countenance of his friend.” How much
more will hereditary predispositions chime
to prepare a father’s intellect to be sharpened
by a son’s arguments ?
* # *
But, it is said, if the bias exist, the
J udge is conscious of it, and fights against
it. Neither a Judge nor any other man is
wholly conscious of the play of sympathetic
influence. A wife frequently becomes, both
in thought and feature, a living replica of
her husband. But neither is conscious of
the steps by which this result is reached.
Therefore, as to that part of his mental pro-
cesses which is beyond his control, the
Judge is biased. So far as he knows him-
self, he may fight against natural impulses,
even to the extent of consciously favouring
his son’s opponent. But that very con-
sciousness will by-and-by breed a recoil ;
and, either way, conscious favor is harmful.
« * *
It is not in the public interest that Brass
the solicitor should prepare cases for Brass
the barrister to argue before Brass the
Judge. 'though the Judge be absolutely
just, the public knowledge of the effects of
consanguinity in ordinary life will create
disbelief in his justice. And if such disbelief
exist, whether it be well or ill-founded,
the administration of justice is prejudiced.

Justice is attained by law, which is fol-
lowed as a profession, for profit. It is not
in the public interest that the profits of law
should be monopolised by certain families.
The law is already a close corporation
better not make it a rotten borough. The
prospect of the creation of a caste of legal
Levites, knit together by ties of blood and
interest, handing down their privileges from
generation to generation, and jealously
defending them against those outside the
pale, cannot be contemplated with satis-
faction. It is not possible or desirable to
close the profession of law to any eligible
person on the ground of his relationship ; i fc
is possible and desirable to so far abrogate
individual freedom that relationship shall
not interfere with public justice or degrade
the public conception of justice.
* * *
On these grounds The Bulletin approves
of the Parliamentary proposal to deprive
lawyers of the right to practise before their
kindred by blood or by marriage. Little
real hardship will be caused when that pro-
posal becomes law. And, in any case, it
seems not wholly unreasonable that Justice
should be considered before her parasites.

the Governor-General of the federation should
be elected by popular voting. This, if any-
thing, is a healthy sign of the sub-conscious
attitude of Australian manhood towards Re-
publican Independence. Sydney D.T. is hard
set to explain away this awkward fact, and
clumsily endeavors to pervert the force of its
significance. The D.T. declares that the
phenomenon only “show's how loose and im-
mature popular opinion may be with regard to
—good old grandiose wheeze !—constitutional
principles.” The citizens don’t care two straws
about alleged “constitutional principles.”
Australian manhood simply knows that it wants
to elect all its own rulers, no matter what
happens to supposed “ constitutional prin-
ciples.” “ But there is no widespread popular
movement in favor of ‘ cutting the painter,’ ”
says the D.T. No ? When a man proposes to
knock out the keystone of an arch, according
to this logic, he has no notion of demolishing
the arch. Because Hori Grey, a democratic
tribune, saturated with the bias of aristocratic
heredity, performed the jesuitical feat of per-
suading himself that Australia could elect its
own Governor-General and still remain a
British dependency, the D.T. argues that demo-
crats of democratic heredity all think the same
way. Not so. The enthusiastic thousands
who cheered Grey at Sydney as no man was
ever cheered before in Australasia applauded not
Grey, the born aristocrat, but Grey, the cham-
pion of equal voting. The ordinary would-be-
free man doesn’t make subtle “ constitutional”
distinctions; he merely strives to attain each
object as it becomes to him desirable. All the
same, the demand for an Australianese Gover-
nor-General means, bluntly and squarely,
“cutting the painter.” The D.T. scorns the
idea that such a desire exists. But the facts
prove otherwise. “Cutting the painter” has
been seriously threatened by Australian Cabinet
Ministers ; its possibility is recognised by the
Anglo-Australian officials in England ; and its
dangerous likelihood has been, time and again,
urged by the very Toryish papers of which
the D.T. is a type. If there existed no
such Australian sentiment, what need would
there be for the periodical Fat Man boast, when
Fatmanish interests are jeopardised, that
Great Britain knows better than to oppose
Australian aspirations too strenuously lest Aus-
tralia should break away? How often have we
not heard that self-satisfied boast ? The plan
of Australian procedure is plain. Let Austra-
lians move doggedly on towards those objects
which they feel they must achieve, which they
feel are necessary to their healthful progress,
and —damn the consequences ! You can’t grow
a stately, full-sized araucaria in an earthen pot.
Inter-Australian Reciprocity.
Editor Bulletin, —Prior to the present dis-
cussion on inter-Australian Customs Treaties, I
laid before you a simple plan for a measure of
interprovincial Freetrade. My proposal was
that where identity of tariff exists, it should,
and could, be taken advantage of at once. The
road to Federation is not easy, as anyone who
studies the tariffs can see. The assimilation of
our domestic legislation would not offer nearly
the number of difficulties that impede tariff-
unity. Leaving aside the taxes on fruits, dried
fruits, and stock, I instance the following items
taken at random :
In these instances there is at once identity and
disparity. N.S.W. and Tas. agree about
ploughs, and Queensland, Westralia, and Tas.
agree about stationery—but the other differences
are tragical. Compromise seems far away.
Yet there are most important identities of
tariff. South Australia and Victoria have
identical tariff's in these directions :
M >st boots and shoes, many acids, bicycles, blacking',
butter, carriages and most vehicles, china and porcelain,
dried fruits, jams and jellies, jewellery, pipe and sheet
lead, silks and satins, etc.
New South Wales and Queensland agree for
the following :
Arrowroot, barley, biscuits, cement, chocolate, cigars,
clocks and watches, cocoa, coffee, cordials, liqueurs and
spirits, galvanised wire, hoop-iron and nails, pickled and
dried fish, wheat and flour, onions, jams and jellies,
kerosene, lace-stuffs, lead, many oils, etc.
But the most important identities of all exist
between South Australia and Queensland. In
my opinion it lies with the Ministries of these
two provinces to strike a powerful and dramatic
blow for Federation. Their tariffs are identical
on the following items :
Ale, most apparel, axles, baskets and wiokerware,
biscuits, spirits, cordials, etc., blacking, boots and shoes,
brassware, cabinetware, most carriages and vehicles,
cement, copperware, much ironwork, most tools, harness,
jewellery, hats and caps, furniture, etc.
With a wide range such as these items cover,
the tariffs of Queensland and S.A. are practi-
cally without difference. A bold federal policy
in Brisbane and Adelaide could bring Queens-
land and S.A. into Customs union next week.
It is actually true that legislation would not be
needed. It is not a question of collecting
Customs. It is a question of not collecting
Customs, and a Ministerial mandate is all that
is actually needed. The Ministers of these
two provinces have it in their hands to do a
great service to Australian unity—and may we
nope that the course of action is not too
simple, too devoid of the pomp of conven-
tion and congress and debate ! If, however,
the move is too daring—let legislative authority
be sought at once. My scheme does not con-
cern the difficulties of difference—only the
possibility of identities. I believe that the
demand for further interprovincial agreement
would be ten times intensified by one good
working agreement such as now proposed in
this and previous letters. Federation would be
recognised in its true light as the one way to
national strength, and I pity the man who, at
such a juncture as this, is too weak to be bold
in such a cause.— Fluffy.
The Republican Victory.
The Congressional elections in the United States
have ended in a Republican majority, reported
by the Foreign-trade S.M. Herald as 104 strong
in a House of 356 members, against a previous
Democratic majority of 80. The last semblance
of the alleged Freetrade reaction is thus gone
for good. But, as a matter of fact, there never
was any Freetrade reaction except what was
manufactured by the shoddy press in England,
Australia and elsewhere, and by the Single-tax
enthusiasts in the States. The Democratic
party took off the wool-duty and reduced the
import-tax on silks and various other luxuries ;
also, it increased a few other taxes, got rid of
the surplus and replaced it by a big deficiency,
made it necessary to borrow money for the first
time since the war, and brought about the worst
commercial crisis within the memory of this
generation. Now the Democrats are utterly
routed; the author of their new tariff is unseated;
their stronghold, New York State, is captured by
the high-tariff party, and all is over. The Sydney
press is now busy explaining away the disaster.
U.S. Consul, Colonel Bell— who was sent to
N.S. Wales to preach Freetrade so that the
simple-minded Cornstalk might be induced to
keep his ports open to Yankee manufactures—
is interviewed by the Telegraph, and cheer-
fully undertakes to account for everything.
“ M'Kinleyism,” he says, “ will never be re-
vived,” and “ Protection is on the down grade ”
in the States ; while right over his statement
stands a cablegram announcing that M‘Kinley
himself has been returned by a majority of
140,000 votes, and that his party proposes to
run him for President. Further, the Colonel —
who as an explainer has no rival, save Mrs.
Mellon —says that the result is quite natural:
the President is elected every four years and
Congress every two years, and “ there is
nearly always a reaction against the President
at the election following.” Considering that
the avowedly high-tariff party held office with-
out a break for 24 years, and in all that time
there was no such reaction, the Colonel’s assur-
ance that the reaction is quite “ usual ” is very
steep indeed. Premier Reid made even a worse
exhibition of himself than the Colonel. Being
asked in the Assembly if he proposed to send
along another congratulatory cablegram, this
time to the Republican party, he cheerfully
replied that the victory only meant that “ one
Tammany party had overthrown another.”
The remark was none too brilliant, and it puts
Mr. Reid in an awkward position, seeing that
he and his friends sent a cable-message (which
simple-minded greeting has never yet been
acknowledged) to that other “ Tammany ’’
crowd, a very few years ago, congratulating it
on being the party of progress, honesty and
enlightenment. His implication, now that his
party has gone utterly broke, that it is oi\Jy a
gang of thieves and corruptionists whose defeat
is of no significance, is vaguely suggestive of
awful perjury somewhere. Altogether the job
of explaining away the Republican triumph is
getting on very slowly indeed.
Finance and Mud.
New South Wales Premier Reid’s Financial
Statement has a ring of honesty about it, but,
at the same time, it ought to wreck his reputa-
tion as a heaven-born financier. The Premier
is so intent on throwing mud at his prede-
cessors that he has time for very little else, and
on the present occasion he spent so much time
in mud-throwing that he wound up his
Financial Statement without giving any
financial statement at all. The main points
of his deliverance were: (1) that the
Dibbs Government produced surpluses which
it had no right to produce by arbitrarily-
sawing amounts off the estimates of expendi-
ture sent in by heads of departments —a thing
which every Government lias done for many
years past —because if every head of a depart-
ment got all the money he asked for the public
expenditure would be illimitable; (2) that
there is a deficiency for 1894 of some .£300,000
or .£400,000 ; and (3) that there is going to be
a deficiency instead of a surplus for last year,
because the new Treasurer is going to add on to
Mr. See’s estimates the£2l6,ooo which was then
saved out of the roads and bridges expenditure,
and charge it to the late Ministry. In other
words, he is going to spend the money last
year, from which it appears that G. H. Reid
can turn the universe backwards, and stand
chronology on its head, and can overtake yester-
day. The deficiency for ’94, he admits, is
arrived at by taking the figures for the 10
months that are gone and estimating those of
the two months to come “on a different
basis; ” whether there would be a shortage
if the estimates were made on the same basis is
not explained. Finally, he announces that
Freetrade is postponed till next June, and ex-
plains, as every other Treasurer has done, that
everything is going to be conducted honestly
and capably henceforward, and that the
monetary sow which was washed has sworn off
for good. The late Treasurer See was a pretty
bad failure, and his perky successor promises,
in his own well-meaning fashion, to be another.
A Voice from Rue Australia.
Seventy lost Rue Australians are petitioning
New South Wales Government to give them
passages back to their native land. It wouldn’t
cost much, and in the name of common humanity
the small boon applied for should be granted.
The chief arguments advanced against it are
that the Rue Australians should be left to
suffer the consequences of their own folly, and
that if the'Government interferes it will only
encourage other visionaries to go off on similar
expeditions and trust to a paternal Legislature
to "see them through in the event of failure.
Neither argument will hold water. The
children, and to some extent the wives, of the
battered argonauts are not responsible for their
miserable situation, and to abandon them on
account of the foolishness of their fathers and
husbands is sheer brutality. As for the fathers
and husbands, the law exists mostly to protect
people from the consequences of their own
folly, and no exception should be made in their
( se. If they are to be left to starve in a hungry
1 I because they allowed themselves to
be taken in by a glozing enthusiast, then
the law should also refuse to take cognisance
of the injury done to depositors in fraudulent
banks, to the victims of confidence-men, to
people who are taken in by bogus companies,
or whose houses are burgled through want of
reasonable precaution, or who can’t get their
wages because they trusted to knavish em-
ployers. The legal system which spends money
to protect all these people, and to recover a
dividend for them wherever possible, can t
reasonably object to lend a hand to its stranded
subjects in Paraguay. Moreover, there is
abundant precedent for such a course of action;
one of the great objects of the consular system,
which is maintained at great expense by all
civilised nations, is to look after stranded sub-
jects in foreign lands, many of them stranded
by their own foolishness. As for the assertion
that the assistance proposed to be granted to
the lost Rue Australians will encourage others
to follow in their footsteps, it rests on no theory
that can bear inspection. If the spectacle of
the Paraguayan pilgrims coming back to start
life afresh, penniless, ragged and gaunt, foot-
sore with tramping over the stony ways
of South America, after having sunk all
their life’s savings in a hopeless ven-
ture, is calculated to induce others to
start on similar expeditions, then there
are some features in the human character which
have hitherto escaped observation. The return
of Lane’s adventurers is more calculated to
serve as a deterrent to similar expeditions in
the future. When they return, it will be as if
a number of hanged men arose from the tomb.
If they remain in South America they will
speedily die out, or vanish from public view
and cease to be heard from, and before long
they will be practically forgotten. If they are
brought back they will scatter to their former
haunts all over Australia, and carry their story
with them, and so long as they live it will be a
difficult matter to get up another Paraguayan
scheme in this country. Considering how much
good red gold that ill-fated movement took out
of Australia, and how much more another such
movement may take out at some future time
unless it is nipped in the bud, it should pay an
actual cash dividend to bring back the 70
haggard petitioners, if only as an object-lesson
to the next crowd of enthusiasts who come
along.
The Same Old Story.
“ There had not been any boat-drill for the
last six months,” said the chief officer of the
Wairarapa at the enquiry into the causes of the
wreck. This corroborates the assertion of the
Seamen’s Union secretary in a recent Bulletin;
and coasting passengers will know henceforth
what they may have to fear in case of a wreck
—covered boats, rusted davits, missing gear,
plugs out, incompetent crews, and “ the Lord
ha’ mercy on us !” And if steamers are crowded,
as they frequently are, the boats wouldn’t go
round anyhow. Thanks to a beautiful provi-
sion of shipping law, which considers only
steerage passengers as “ passengers,” and deems
saloon passengers guests of the captain (! !) a
vessel can (and does) carry as many souls above
her license-number as greedy owners choose to
dump into her. That is, if a vessel is licensed
by the Marine Boards to carry 200 passengers,
there is nothing whatever to prevent 1000 from
being carried, and the owners are liable to
no penalty provided the surplus are but
“guests of the captain,” i.e., saloon-passengers.
Marine Boards never bother their heads about
these things. “Marine Board” is merely
a synonym for a set of fossils who sit
and spin red tape and draw fees and ascribe
to “ the visitation of God ” accidents due
primarily to their own recklessness and in-
capacity. Above all things they dread “ a
fuss ” which may shift them in their shells, so
they “ keep in” with the shipping owners and
give as little trouble as they possibly can.
And every now and again a wreck happens and
100 lives are lost, and the Marine Board con-
cerned wails and beats its breast in sympathy,
and an enquiry is held, and an officer (who has
probably worked 12 or 14 hours a day without
a break for the month before the wreck) is
disrated, and then the Board folds its hands
and goes to sleep till the next wreck. Then
the process is repeated, and The- Bulletin
prints a paragraph like this one, and tells the
public it is an Ass not to insist on stringent
laws and competent supervision on behalf of
travellers; and the public reads, and agrees
that it is an Ass, and says “ something should
be done.” And nothing ever is done, or will
be done till the Day of Judgment.
More “ Silken Bonds.”
London Times suggests the appointment of
Australian Judges on the British Privy Council
to adjudicate on Australian cases, and other
“colonial” Judges to decide, in like manner,
cases from their own “colonies.” This is, of
course, another devious, anti-Republican method
of “ tightening the silken bonds.” Apart from
the silken bonds, if Australian Judges are to
decide Australian appeals, why should they go
all the way to England to do it, and make
suitors crawl 12,000 miles at enormous expense
in pursuit of them ? Why shouldn’t the same
Judges hear the same cases and decide them
according to the same intellectual process right
here in Australia ? Or, if there is any reason
not yet explained why they shouldn’t do the
business in Australia, why should they do it in
England any more than in Fiji or Honolulu ?
Also, if Australian Judges adjudicating on
purely Australian cases must not hold their
courts in Australia, why doesn’t England hold
its Appeal Court in Nova Scotia or at the Cape
of Good Hope ? The only possible reason for
dragging Judges and counsel half-way round
the globe to decide some simple matter which
could be decided quite as easily in Melbourne or
Sydney, is that the Australian Judges will thereby
wear the coveted distinction of P. 0., and being
located nearer the Fount of Honour will have a
better show of being made lords ; but that is a
purely personal matter, and there is no earthly
reason why suitors should be ruined in order
that J udges may grovel after titles which are
of no use to anyone save the groveller. More-
over, the Australian local courts and execu-
tives are quite competent to hang a man, or to
condemn him to life-long imprisonment, or to
re f use _ as i n Morrison’s case—to a man under
sentence of death the right of Privy Council
appeal, even when such lawyers as Salomons
and Barton, Q.G.’s, hold that he has good
grounds for carrying his case to the highest
tribunal in the empii e. And if they can do all
that, they are fully competent to decide finally
on all cases—even those affecting the blessed
interests of Property. The law dealt out by
Appeal-Judge Smith in Sydney would be
exactly the same quality as that dealt out
by Smith, P. 0., in London, and to make liti-
gants go, at their own expense, all the way to
London merely that Smith or someone else
may be a P. 0., is an obviously lop-sided
arrangement. Let every man pay for his own
title.
Christianity to Measure.
Pastor Jefferis, the ex-Sydney land-specu-
lator now in Adelaide, is “much pained to
observe the great growth of Socialism, and
feels it devolves upon him as a teacher of truth
and righteousness to combat this tendency.”
When land-values rise and Parson Jefferis is
relieved from the worry of looking after lost
shekels, he may find time to read a book called
the Bible, which contains the most perfect creed
of Socialism yet announced. Moses (or whoever
wrote Leviticus and Deuteronomy) was a
Socialist, and condemned in no doubtful language
the usury which is the prop of the conventional
church. All the Jewish prophets were
Socialists, and Isaiah the greatest of Socialists.
Pastor Jefeeris will find his denunciations
of those who “ grind the faces of the
poor,” and of those “ who decree un-
righteous decrees to turn aside the needy from
justice,” as applicable now as when they were
written. And when Mr. Jefferis gets to the
New Testament, he will notice that the
Socialism of the Gospels goes as far as Com-
munism. The rich are repeatedly and terri-
bly denounced. The poor are blessed. The
voluntary surrender of property for the benefit
of the poor is recommended to the rich young
man (the Saviour didn’t advise him to join
a National Ass and defend his wealth).
“The ideal of the Christian society,” says
Graham, “ was equality of social condi-
tions, or, if any inequality, it was to be an
inversion of the existing one, requiring from
the greatest the greatest sum of services and
sacrifices ; no private property ; no competition
save to do the greatest good, with mutual love
making all possible and warming and vitalising
the whole community.” Of course, this teach-
ing is quite incompatible with the existence of
the fat-clergyman system ; and when Pastor
Jefferis does read the Bible he will probably
see it is to his interest to keep its socialism in
the background. In the meantime, it is to be
hoped that pious old Adeladies will endeavor
to assuage the “ pain ” of their speculative
shepherd by liberal prostrations before the
little god Saucer.
Apparently New South Wales Railway Com-
missioner Eddy has not been squarely treated-
He came here on the distinct understanding
that his salary was to be increased if his work
was satisfactory. His work was emphatically
satisfactory, and his salary remained at the
original figure—principally, as it seems, because
the understanding wasn’t embodied in the legal
agreement. And now Commissioner Eddy—
perhaps the best civil-servant Australia ever
had—is returning to England, presumably
because, being a man of unique ability, England
is prepared to pay him better. The Bulletin
doesn’t hesitate to say that if money would
induce Commissioner Eddy to stay, no money
should be spared. If £IOOO a year doesn’t pay
him, then give him £SOOO, or £6OOO. Under
the circumstances, an extra thousand or three
is of no account whatever. Money cannot be
put into the balance in comparison with brains.
If Commissioner Eddy was worth £3OOO when
he came to New South Wales, he is worth
double now that he is thoroughly acquainted
with local railway needs and conditions. He
has saved the province hundreds of thousands
of pounds, and his salary is a flea-bite in com-
parison. An incompetent man in his place, or
even a man not quite so competent, may cost
the province in a week many times Mr. Eddy’s
salary for a year. So, The Bulletin repeats,
if money can persuade the retiring Commis-
sioner to remain, he should be allowed prac-
tically to fix his own figure. Ability and
reliability united are priceless.
S. P. Reynolds, an inconsequential person who
owns a tannery, and who sat in Vic. Parliament
as representative of N. Melb. for a couple of
sessions, broke out in bitter lamentation at an
entertainment given him by a local Employers’
Union the other night. The wild woe of
Reynolds arises from the base ingratitude of
the N. Melb. electors in returning a better man
to Parliament at last election. “I find bene-
volence does not secure votes,” wailed the flab-
bergasted tanner. “ Men for whom I have
obtained employment, and whose families lived
on my charity, voted against me. As an em-
ployer of labor, I have distributed £IOO,OOO in
the electorate during the last six months, yet
men in my employ contributed to the deposit-
money of my opponent. The electors have
taken the most inferior men, men of no business
and no business capacity, and given them the
management of the country.” Tears. Reynolds’
lament is an ample justification of the judgment
of the electors of N. Melb., if his conduct in
Parliament, where he see-sawed on a rail, had
not justified them in firing him out. The man
who thinks he has a prescriptive right to repre-
sent the electors simply because he sends to the
local soup-kitchen the crumbs from his table
and “ gives ” work —quite a fin de sie.de touch,
this latter—can’t be argued with.
It is cabled that British syndicates “ are allow-
ing a disposition to undertake some of the
Queensland land-grant railways,” provided
“the Govt, shall bear the cost of survey and
shall guarantee interest.” The syndicate is a
modest and retiring blossom, and wants but
little here below. Under the existing law the
State is to pay in land the whole cost of build-
ing the line—in fact, as the land is put down at
only a fraction of its value, the State is to pay the
cost several times over—while the syndicate is
to own both the land and the railway ! And if,
in addition to all this, the State will pay cost
of survey and guarantee interest on the syndi-
cate’s debentures—so that it won’t need to put

The success that Araykos has met with,
and the universal favor it enjoys both in the Old

advantages resulting from its use as a mouth-wash,

Then the syndicate will have the railway, the

The Westraliau Nigger.
A famous Yankee-German mining man who
has travelled the earth and has just come from
Westralia after a long stay on and about the
goldfields, tells The Bulletin that the Wes-
tralian nigger is as abject a slave as ever the
n if?g er was in the States. He works in scores
of cases chained to his kind master’s barrow.
And here is a letter just received by The Bul-
letin from Coolgardie :
The Westralian nigger is an unhappy wretch whose
wants are few, and it takes him all his time to supply
them. Heretofore it was thought he had nothing to give
in return for salvation, and, as a consequence, he was
never suspected of owning a soul worth saving. But had
the man with the long coat and the white choker and the
itching palm known that gold was to be found here, and
that the nig. was a good “specker,” a brighter future
might have opened for the nig. aforesaid. But he said
nothing about the gold and went on living as his fore-
fathers did—on lizards and snakes, and bardies and
sandal-wood nuts, with an occasional blow-out on a kan-
garoo or emu. When he could find nothing to eat he could
always fill up with water, which he had taken some care to
conserve in namoi-holes in the rocks. Unfortunately for
him the secret of his gold became known, and he—especi-
ally in the neighborhood of Mount Margaret—is no longer
cheerful. Diggers and new-ohums and ex-bank-clerks
and city larrikins swarm down on him with horses and
camels and rifles, and drink his scant supply of water, and
shoot his game and borrow his gin and daughter and
kidnap his son, and riddle him with bullets if he puts
up a protest. If the whites desire possession of the
auriferous parts of his country, surely some non-
mineral-bearing portion of it should be set aside for
the black’s especial use, where he might be allowed
to die something approaching a natural death. As it
is, he has only the alternative of b ing shot on his
own land or clearing out to the spinifex country where
there is neither game nor gold nor gabbie. If be tries to
ward off starvation by stealing a little tucker from the
spoilers of his hunting-ground he does so at the risk of
his life, and if he ventures out of the scrub and asks for
gabbie to quench his thirst he gets lead, and if he gives
way to his savage and natural instincts and “goes for’’
his enemy a raid is made on him, and he and all his rela-
tions are wiped out. When he has the legitimate digger
to cope with his case is perhaps not quite so bad,
but, u iluckily for him, there is a class of men here
calling themselves diggers whose chief delight it is to sit
around camp-fires and boast of the number of niggers
they’ve shot, not in self-defence but simply because they
were niggers. If the meek missionary is too busily en-
gaged in converting the distant eocoanut-and-pearl-shell-
and-rich-land-endowed nig. to bother about this unfor-
tunate, is there no one with the cause of humanity at
heart prepared to come to the rescue ? From Coolgardie
to the Murchison, a distance of at least 400 miles, every
rook or soak where a drink of water is obtainable is made

The Victorian Executive has duly strangled
Elijah Cockcroft, the illiterate jockey, who
knocked his lady-love on the head and sliced open
her swan-like throat in the ecstacy of jealous
delirium, which several frigidly dissecting scien-
tists and two or three armor-plated prison-officials
have said was not insanity. If the ignorant
jockey was not insane so far as Fanny Mott was
concerned, will these expert authorities please
describe his actual condition ? As was the case
in a recent Queensland sensational girl-hacking
tragedy, Cockcroft’s motive for murder was his
real, red-hot, genuine, animal love for his Fanny.
Unlike the Queensland woman-killer, Cockcroft
gave no handle to the teetotal-intemperance man
to indict Der-rink as the mother of murder, and,
beyond the fact that he was ignorant of ordinary
school-lore and predisposed to religious impres-
sions, Cockcroft betrayed no outward and visible
sign of being an inward assassin. He was
probably a decent enough fellow, or he would have
been a more distinguished jockey. Once more the
conclusion is limned in inerasable vermilion : All
True Love is Insanity. Now, insanity, when its
hallucinations are humored, is harmless to the
humorers ; but, when its gospel is impeached and
ridiculed, it explodes like a melinite bomb. Love,
as a form of insanity—real nitric-acid, boiling-
ammonia sort of love—in its repulsed phases,
always spells Murder. The love that can resign
its object, for its object’s own happiness, is a poor,
puerile counterfeit, a poetical chimera that has no
rootlets in the seedbed of virility. Love is the
most selfish and greediest absorbent known to
nature, and it means Death to rivals and the
sacrifice of the beloved if she prove unwilling.
Real three-ply, all-wool love always has the
courage of its mission and the recklessness that
chances every hazard. If any besieged woman,
who wants real Love, doubts her lover’s bona-Jides,
let her put him to the test of murdering her or
letting her go ; and if he doesn’t start to make her
into statuesque cold meat she had better let him go.
Law, civilisation, re igion— nothing— can dam up
the molten lava of true love boiling in the
volcano of stirred manhood. Any yearn that
can be restrained is counterfeit. It may be
passably pleasing, it may be lengthily endurable :
but it lacks the inspiration that begins and ends
with —“ My life and your life.” Love is insanity,
and every real lover is as Cockcroft was in his
murder act. Those who are less afflicted with
love merely experience the passing phantoms of
idiocy. Cockcroft’s heart was too mighty for
his brain. He wanted Fanny Mott more than
life. Life without Fanny was less cheerful
than death. Fanny didn’t want Elijah. The
pair were out in a paddock together driving
home some horses. Like the prophet of old,
Elijah had his chariot of fire. He seated Fanny
i n it. The cause of his insanity being removed,
Elijah became once more a harmless maniac. That
his brain was weak is apparent from the reported
incident that, being asked on the gallows “the
usual question,” he said—“l love Jesus,” and
then sobbed. Well, throw the clods on the coffin.
The law of Victoria has strangled another lunatic;
Madness has once more avenged Love ; and Elijah
has gone to meet Fanny in Heaven. It reads like
the termination of the old style of novel —“they
lived happily ever afterwards.”
A low agitator has had the hardihood to say
that it was a disgrace to Bendigo (Vic.) City
Council that men employed by the municipal
contractors should be paid as little as 15s. per
week of 72 hours. Worse still, this hardened
ruffian (by name Egan, secretary of the Trades’
Hall), when the “city fathers” indignantly
denied his allegation, was brazen enough to
prove it by producing affidavits from two of the
men so employed and paid. One of these is
here reproduced from Bendigo Evening Matt.
of Oct. 27 —
I, James Quinn, of Baxter-street, Bendigo, in the
Colony of Victoria, do solemnly and sincerely declare that
I am employed by , a contractor under the
City Council of Bendigo ; that I am a married man wit h a
family of five children ; that 1 start work at six o’clock in
the morning, and am seldom finished before six o’clock in
the evening, being allowed one hour for dinner ; that I am
paid wages at the rate of 15s. a week without board ; that
I have been employed by at the same rate of
wages for a period of over twelve mouths ; that I am
working on Council work.
A similar affidavit from another man, but with
his name omitted, was also published. Next
day both the men were “sacked ” by the con-
tractor aforesaid. Yet this contractor had
been allowed .£127 more this year than last, in
order that a decent wage should be paid. The
Bulletin thinks this case breaks the record.

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,
November 13, 1894.
My Dear Moorabinda—
Melbourne Cup (a piece of plate this year) of
’94 incontestably proved that age cannot wither
nor burst booms stale its infinite variety. Despite a
reduced stake and other dismals, the Cup was the
usual fine 16-hands spectacle, where people were
so packed that men, in saluting their acquaint-
ances, knocked other people’s hats off in trying to
raise their own. For it was a crowd, though not
so great as last year.
The Guvmentonse party were all in line, as
usual. Lady Hope.toun’s Cup-gown was the
black-and-white-checked silk, with lurid intervals
of magenta, in which she graced Rand wick Spring
meeting. Lady Duff did the lawn with Mr.
Pennyman, in white spots —I mean, he was. Her
dress was a sea-gull combination of grey and
white, and a black toque hat. Lady Norman
Cup’d it in guinea-heu colors. Lady Gormans-
town (her gigantic Lord regarded the Cup horses
as if mentally dividing them into chops and
steaks) looked skittish in salad-green and white,
and a Spring-like toppmg-off. Lady G. is a
medium-sized, fair-haired personage with a bold,
Roman-mother profile. I have seen many fairy
queens in pantomime the living image of Her Ex.
of Raspberryland.
Lord Hopetoun wore a pallid aspect and iron-
grey cap-k-pie unrelieved by a boutonniere. The
sonsie Kintore wore pink flowers, the color of his
roseate cheek. Sir Thou Art My Soul Robinson
wore pink flowers, too. Anybody who saw Wal-
lace Brownlow as The Mikado has seen Sir Wil-
liam Robinson, by the way. On dit that His
Musical Ex., of W. A., is quite a lamblike person-
age to handle. During the recent rehearsals of
“Predatoros,”at the Princess’, Wallace Brownlow
transposed a note a tone or so lower one day to
rest his voice. “You don’t sing the higher note,
Mr. B.,’’ meekly said His Ex. (who was glued to
every rehearsal) —“ Do you think it would aound
better to sing it that way?” Such unnatural
modesty seems to point to Sir W. R. as the coming
Gounod.
But, to return to the Cup. Miss Kate Duff wore
a Cup gown that the most retiring woman could
safely go shopping in. Mias Heather Duff wore
blue and butter color lace. Miss Grace Norman
(people said she was the prettiest of the Y. R.
damsels, though I considered Mias Kate Duff
“got her nose in front,” as the jockeys say) was
cool in mauve and white. Miss Bowden-Smith
looked rather like a toilet-table in maize covered
with window-pane check white muslin. By the
way, I placed Lord and Lady Glasgow among the
princes and rulers at the Derby, whereas they
never crossed the seas. The odd part of it was I
knew they hadn’t, but when somebody who ought
to know said “Lady Glasgow” to a comfortable
dowager, all boots and bonnet, I forgot that the
Maoriland Ex. had omitted the trifling ceremony
of coming across. Whenever anybody indicates a
female form with hips as large as if the owner had
swallowed a life-belt, and a waist to match, also a
very after-date bonnet and a general expression as
if the wearer bad a tendency to go to sleep stand-
ing up—whenever anybody points an impressive
forefinger at that sort of person and says “Lady
Munro ” in a hoarse, melodramatic whisper, I fall
into the trap at the word “go.”
One of the handsomest dresses was very pro-
perly sported by Melbourne’s “society ” Madame
Mautaliui. It was really a good gown—the tender
hue of a cup of cold-and-milky tea, the skirt of
wide striped satin cut perfectly plain and short—
postillion bodice and whopping sleeves of cold-tea
velvet with a pleated vest of white chiffon and
side-pieces of real ecru lace. It was stylish, un-
aggressive,' and expensive, and I think when you
can hurl these three adjectives at a get-up and hit
it hard every time, there is nothing more to be
said. Mrs. (Dr.) O’Hara (who won money on
Ilium, a gentle gee-gee owned by Mr. Purves,
Q. C.) wore one of the neatest black gowns—striped
crepon and jet, with a bonnet trimmed with pink
clover. It seems to me that unless you wear
clothing like an explosion in a dye-vat and do the
lawn backwards or some way equally eccentric,
you stand a better chance of being seen in black
than anything else at the Melbourne Cup.
Some day women will dress for the Y.R.O.
festival as men do for fishing excursions. They
will see the hollow mockery of going out with big
leg-of-mutton sleeves and getting home with pan-
cakes in lieu thereof. And as they sew on furlongs
of ripped-otf flounces, some day they will rise up
and take a line from Daniel in the lion’s den, and
go down into the raging Cup almost as economi-
cally clad as he was. For all its reputation as a
rag-fair, the lawn at Flemington on the first Tues-
day in Nov. is really the worst place to spread
your tail-feathers in that ever was. No time for
“ settling” your skirts and posing against a balus-
trade there, mother. The burning question is
how to keep the other woman’s parasol out of
your eye.
Mrs. Byron Moore, in electric-blue figured silk,
with cornflowers (it was as much a cornflower Cup
as Carbine’s was) in a black jet bonnet, had
chosen a good color to go with Byron Moore’s
spruce-grey race-suit, which is more than most
wives think of. A certain auburn-haired official
personage has a Joan whose penchant for pea-
green amounts to a positive injustice to Darby,
who toddles along looking more like a glowing
wax-match than a person who could be toned
down to chromatic neutrality if his wife only
would wear a red feather.
Patterned stuffs were all the go at the Cup.
Things like red tarantulas swimming for dear
life in a pea-green sea appeared here and
there, but every yard of really fashionable
stuff was patterned, either checked, striped,
flecked with things like tadpoles in articulo mort is,
telegraphic tape-marks, flowers, spots, or fruit.
In many instances, the only plain space on a
toilet was where the wearer came to the surface.
Good lace was very plentiful, and augured well
for the Customs’ returns if everybody got their
dues. Airy gossamer fabrics like crdpe, gauze
and chiffon were on every gown—the typical
fashionable bodice was of silk or satin, covered
over with chiffon, drawn down to a ribbon at the
waist. Accordeon-pleated sleeves were a strong
card. Crepon was a favorite stuff—the rougher
the better. There wasn’t a pin’s point of dif-
ference between a brunette from Sydney in
carrotty ploughed-up-looking ordpon and a red
retriever pup, so far as wild rumpledness of out-
line was concerned.
I really think that a tall, fat, mining millionaire,
who carried three umbrellas (shut) at one grab on
Cup-day—and they only looked like so many
slender willow wands, he was so massive—l really
think he ought to have chosen a plumper wife
than the palpable light-weight who occupies the
proud position. In this age of thin-legged
mediums, with their hosen peeling off from the
attenuation following on the incarnation of
Oissie, Josephine and Geordie, you cannot see a
fat-thin couple without morbidly thinking that
the fat party is the vampire battening on the thin
party, whose socks or stockings, as the case may
be, are probably corkscrewing round their ankles.
I have been very much struck lately by the fact
that the fat is most unequally divided in many
otherwise well-regulated families.
Nellie Stewart, in a creamy silk skirt with a
pink silk bodice, reminded me of a Neapolitan
ice, but you musn’t think she didn’t look alto-
gether fetching, all the same; Mrs. Tapley was
on the lawn in the mauve frock she wore at the
Sydney theatrical f6te; Maggie Moore wore a silk
dress shot with bubble-colors and a rather down-
the-harbor hat; Lady Somebody— not Lady
Munro, mind you—wore what I considered the
most shrieking dress on the lawn. This “ con-
fection,” which, metaphorically, almost gave me a
black eye, was of white serge trimmed with frills
of red and white plaid. The bodice had flaming
scarlet sleeves and capes like a fish’s gills of the
tartan mixture as before. A black bonnet corked
a turn-out that would have made an ideal costume
for a living “ad.” to encourage folk to drink
M’Tavish’s whisky. Second place in the outni
costume stakes was filled by a Sydneyite in grey
with a Quaker fichu of white mull and a Quaker-
shaped bonnet of steel beads. The face inside it,
however, reminded you of every sort of lady but
Sister Ruth. No particular color was first favorite
at the Cup, though cornflowers rather made the
running, as they did in ’9O for bonnets and bou-
tonnieres alike. I was sorry to see that black
roses and violets had a good innings. No woman
of taste would mount such a frost-hitten trimming
at any time, for it looks as if she had been stand-
ing on her head in an ink-bottle and is an
outrage on nature. In these matters we are yet a
long way off the French, who never wear an arti-
ficial flower unless it’s naturally in season. These
burnt-cork floralities come from Germany, by the
way.
The “Butterfly fringe” was the Cup style—a
wildly fluffy bit of front hair, not poodle-curled,
but artistically waved. Its advent seems to toll
the knell of the bang-net, for which relief much
thanks, say the Johnnies who spent hours that
might have been more—er—profitably employed
in untangling Guinevere’s fringe-bag off their
shirt-studs after every engagement— or so the
flirts of both sexes inform me. One thing, if the
Butterfly fringe catches on any of Lancelot’s
surface inequalities it’s all up with the lady
since it is generally only the wearer’s own
in the sense that she has a receipted bill for it.
The onion-net fringe gave a sense of security to
the wearer that the butterfly bang can never hope
to emulate. “Mind my net,’’ was a generally
respected war-cry when hair-pins had blundered
and there was danger of the whole thing coming
off; but the wavy butterfly, which tempts an
amorous swain to toy with its fluffy disorder, at
awful risk of its coming off and leaving the lady
with a forehead half-way over her caput, would
put Amaryllis on pins and needles to get out of
the shade as soon as possible. I venture to pre-
dict, while the style is still in its infancy, that
“Noli me tanyere ” will be the motto of the
butterfly bangers. White veils with black spots
were all the go at the Cup. A more femininely
becoming fashion never rose in the east, though
the people who sport them do sometimes remind
you of unboiled currant-dumplings, especially
when they have a plethora of spots.
I was present at a rose festival at the Austral
Salon, Melbourne, on Monday week. The Salon
swells as it proceeds (in more ways than one), and
if it gets much more rushed the cosy room on the
Block will only be large enough to hold the
disciples’ goloshes. The Salon is to be congratu-
lated on always arranging a picturesque mise-en
action. On Monday the girls singing and recit-
ing, the youths fiddling and ’celloing among lashins
and lavins of roses, the tea-cups set about, the
subdued light—the artistic fixings—all made up
into an ensemble that reminded me of many fine
pictures I have seen. Captious people might
urge that though one maiden had a strong and'
thoroughly cultivated voice, she sang a passionate
love-song as if it was a multiplication-table set to
music instead of choosing something brilliant and
unmawkish—like the “Dashing White Sergeant,”
say ; but I have seen people gladly pay honest
silver to listen to much worse vocalism than the
Salon serves up gratis to its friends and backers.
Two of the Salongers will shortly have a novel
apiece on the market. Miss Melbourne Punch
Murphy goes ’Ome to publish, in the form of a
tale, her seasoned opinions on the questions of the
day, and Miss Osmond has a book of stories on
the stocks. “Of making books there is no end.”
The prophet wouldn’t say “ All men are liars ”
nowadays. He would put it “All women are
story-tellers.”
The garden-party at Melb. Government House,
on the 9th, was a much smaller assemblage than
last year, but it was a great success backed by ex-
tremely lively music. Rather a gloom was cast
over the afternoon by the suicide of Major Inglis
the same morning, which sad affair came as a
great shock to his many friends. It even had
the effect of making Lady Hopetoun (in pink and
cream) thaw conversationally, and gushing people
took the opportunity to introduce themselves
and their friends to Her Ex. in her melting
moment.
But, in spite of momentary gloom, joviality in
all its phases sat upon the host and hostess. From
the subdued joy of the prisoner who hears the
releasing key turn, to the more hilarious expres-
sions of a fat man getting away alive from a can-
nibal island, you traced all shades of intense relief
in the manner and conversation of the Hopetouns.
For the G.P. was the last big affair, after which
their Excellencies were to depart for their country
residence “ contagious ” to Geelong until their
departure. “So we won’t be very far off,” said
Lady H. in a spurt of amiability to an enquiring
tormentress, quite forgetting that up to very
recently it didn’t matter a row of pins to the fat
woman (who yearned to make a sister of her)
whether Her Ex. was at Collingwood or the North
Pole. Many people farewelled the ’Opetouns
then and there, although the real wrench
won’t come until April. The premature good-
byes were most affecting, tearful adieux to the
Gov. at the last big revel of his reign, although he
sojourns on for several more moons ; it looked
dreadfully as if people were waving their farewell
handkerchiefs, so to speak, at the beer-and-skittles
aspect of Government House.
I consider the Hopetouns the living illustration
of the horsey proverb, “It isn’t the distance, bub
the pace, that kills.” They shirked nothing
during Cup-week, and gave entertainments almost
every night, and the result was that, on Oaks-day,
Lord Hopetoun staggered home semi-sunstruck,
and had to be laid out in lavender in the hospital.
The brazen Australian sun evidently means to
leave off as it began. At Lord H.’s first levee, he
nearly fainted before he had squeezed the digits
of half his subjects, because the sun had its eye on
him through one pane of glass.
It was a day of sorts for the G.P. The muslin
brigade said they melted, and the woolly ones
drew your attention to how cold the breeze was.
The aide-de-kong’s long-lost sister (double mean-
ing on the long) turned up with five black plumes
in her hat, and suggested five shots a penny.
Lady Duff wore flame-color bengaline and black
lace. The Duff demoiselles, in white mull over
yellow and pink and white respectively, seemed
rather out of it on two chairs at the edge of the
crowd. Gov. Duff burst forth into lavender kids,
and must have heard that the Viotoriennes
thought him handsome, judging by the way he
twiddled his moustache.
I saw some pretty dresses. Mrs. Francis Hart
(W.A.), wife of the “Predatoros ” librettist, wore
a very taking cape of black velvet and white
moire, with a trimming of white ostrich ; but in
one or two cases the wrong colors were hoisted.
Who would think, for example, that a woman
with a toast-colored complexion would wear a
curry-tinted frock? One of Melbourne’s ex-
beauties, in an elaborately girly white gown, had
a string of coral beads round her neck—tho’ she
certainly looked as if she had cut all her
teeth—wisdom included. Melbourne’s alleged
prettiest woman (who is also a crack bil-
liardist) came in washing-blue velvet and satin.
Mrs. John Eales wore a white silk gown with
bands of insertion that became her bridal blushes
to aT. But imagine a gladiator-red frock with
silver tinsel bodice, like Henry Vee before
Harfleur; and another of purple velvet with blue
forget-me-nots in the hat 1 Could one ever hope

Melbourne Confidences.
Melbourne, November 13.
According to local fashion scribes, Cup-day’s
grey and threatening morning was responsible for
a falling-off in the splendor of the dresses. But I
don’t quite see it myself, as the weather was fairly
settled by starting-time, and most women are
plucky enough to take a certain amount of risk
over such a stake as a new gown—“ wear it to-day
and wail it to-morrow ” being a most womanish
motto. And it would be hard to find a more
enthusiastic exponent of this spirit than a lady I
saw on the lawn, the daughter of a former Banana-
land Agent-General, who, with her parents and
sisters, was wrecked in a sailing vessel off the
Queensland coast at the outset of their voyage to
England. Ultimately, they got ashore in boats ;
but while still in danger, and in the intervals of
prayers and hymns, the damsel in question was
warned to prepare for the worst. “I’ve just been
thinking,” replied Miss Sixteen, buoyantly, “that
if we do go down, this wreck’s been a jolly lark,
anyhow!”
The men of the vice-regal party were a little less
resplendent than at the Derby. Lord Hopetoun’s
grey was of a darker shade, and most of the others
affected black, with not a single bright flower en-
livening their white carnation bouquets. Gov.
Gormanston, careless of rain or shine, was, out-
wardly, the homespun patriarch of yore, though
his fellow-countrymen claim that in the case of
“ Yenico Preston* Viscount Gormanston, premier
Viscount of Ireland,” there’s no need for painting
and decorating. His title, I believe, is more
awfully ancient than those of all his brother
Governors, in these latitudes, put together.
Lady Gormanston, who, being a second wife,
is much younger than her husband, looked
remarkably handsome at the races—her black
eyes, golden hair, and bright complexion set off
by a stringless, gold-crowned bonnet, crested with
black plumes, and a delightful pinky-golden
sunset satin, its bodice ruffled with pink and black
chiffon. The description, perhaps, sounds a little
stagey, but the costume and its really queenly
wearer caught on very well with male observers.
Women, as a rule, 1 think, preferred the cream
blue-grey twilight melange of Sydney’s vice-regal
dame.
Miss Feilding’s red and green checked silk,
banded with moire and butter guipure, was a vast
improvement on the floppy blouse and nonde-
script skirt of her Derby get-up. But a blouse,
unohaperoned by an outer jacket, always does
lack dignity. Which reminds me that Miss
Nellie Chirnside, the young lady of the clan (vice
Mrs. Everard Browne) adorned the Cup in a
bright pink accordeon-pleated vest, which looked
exactly like a lamp-shade under her tan coat.
That’s the worst of accordeon-flutes, they have
such a papery effect; and another woman, who had
ventured on an entire brown costume of that ilk,
might just as well have been done up in a sous 6
envelope.
To return to blouses, the haughty Countess
ceases to be impressive when she sets out for a
morning’s shopping, in a nice bodice, showing
that familiar rear-rift between it and the skirt,
which, despite patent clasps, still provokes women
to that nervous spine-clutching so bewildering to
uninitiated man.
Flemington was delightfully green and flowery
on Tuesday, and prominent among those Zingari-
ing over its pleasant pastures was braw Kintore,
seemingly more in tune with things in general
than the Potentate of Perth who sat communing
with himself all day. Westralian visitors, con-
sulted on the subject, gave it as their opinion
that he was thinking of “the old ’un ” —‘‘old
’un ” not being, as one might suppose, an irre-
verent pet-name for her ladyship of those regions,
but merely a Dickensese phrase used by t’other-
siders to indicate that their viceroy is off on his
old tack, viz., music. As the gubernatorial opera,
“ Predatoros,” was to be produced at a Princess’s
matinee on Nov. 12, the proffered explanation of
his Ex.’s abstraction was no doubt correct. He
was wondering, perhaps, whether his official con-
nection with the Crown would permit him to
accept a call before the curtain, and if so, whether
it were better to walk boldly to the fore or let
Williamson and Musgrove drag him on.
Nellie Stewart’s pink - and - white array was
as successful as her toilettes ever are, though
it couldn’t possibly be more becoming than
her “cheeky’’-cheeky Derby suit. The coif-
fure of plaited hair, affected by la belle
Rosette off the stage, is quite a rarity in an
age of coils and rolls, carrying one back to the
Arcadian days of old when overnight braids pre-
luded innocent festivity. The tongs fiend has
changed all that, and is turning the nation pre-
maturely grey. Though gold must be tried by
fire, the same ordeal apparently doesn’t answer
with hair.
The worst of it is that the fatal facility and
superior seeresy of the new method has extended
its popularity beyond our sex. The man who
would die rather than face a burglar in a night-
cap of curl-papers, experiences no qualm at ithe
idea of a locked door, a lighted gas-jet, and an
odour of burnt feathers. So widespread has the
pernicious practice become that an important
Vic. inland town boasts a popular parson, whose
back-tilted shovel hat displays a forehead fluff of
curls, which his lady parishioners declare to be
artificially waved. In fact, they aver that much
as they esteem and revere their shepherd_(who,
by the way, is a bachelor), nothing would induce
them to accept that fringe as natural—-no, not if
its owner swore to it on a cartload of Bibles.
The pretty Kintore cousin was again to the fore
in black grenadine fichued with cream lace, as was
Miss Grace Norman, looking rather soubrettish, I
thought, in heliotrope-muslin and a pert hat.
This damsel, since her arrival in Brisbane, has
acquired to a T the appearance and manner of a
flananalander. This is intended as a compliment.
Those who know say that the Northerners, if not
the prettiest, are the most fetching girls in Aus-
tralia. They are not burdened by the evidences
of rude health, though their complexions pass
well enough at night, but they have splendid eyes,
are born dancers and desperate flirts to a woman.
Mrs. Rupert Clarke was responsible for the
smartest of the “Cup teas,” but the Cliveden
family are not visible at present except at church
or charitable entertainments.
Which reminds me of a certain very smart
recent Toorak fete, whioli enabled a society goody
guild to flash its light before the eyes of men.
The tea buffet was superintended by a row of
tony dowagers, masquerading in muslin gowns.
To how few is it given to look distingue amid
squalid surroundings (if the spilt tea and crumbled
cake of Toorakia may be so coarsely described) !
I am bound to confess that the dames in question
were not among the rare exceptions, and customers
discussed their shilling snacks haunted by remi-
niscences of steamboat stewardesses and waiting-
room ogresses. It was in this connection that the
shocking faux-pas of a lately-imported johnny is
said to have occurred. “(No; I; can’t think of
troubling you. Miss Z.,” he observed gallantly to
the pretty Hebe who would have replenished his
cup. “I’ll hand it to old Dishwalloper here!”
indicating with a lordly wave of his hand an
attendant matron, nearly and dearly related to
his horrified hearer.
lam afraid we women are selfish wretches. I
noticed many couples at the races, whose ap-
pearance made it glaringly apparent that the
small sum available for decoration had been put
on “the Missus.” There was on the lawn one
most prominent and sour-visaged woman, the
cynosure of all eyes, who obviously had bullied
her smaller half into the outing, over-ruling all
excuses as to lack of clothes, on the grounds that
if he gave his hair an extra dab and invested in a
paper-collar he’d pass in a crowd —she, meanwhile,
pluming herself in the consciousness of an outfit
saved out of the butcher’s bill. It was a
costume, and no mistake—loud enough to be heard
at Rand wick, 600 miles away. Bright yellow
muslin over ditto sateen, very short in front to
display No. 9 white boots, and gloves to match.
Just let me add that the wearer was 48, if a day,
and of a scrub-saucepan complexion, and you will
agree that it wasn’t the consciousness of his own
grimy hands and dusty boots that worried the
poor old man so perceptibly and made him squirm
shamefacedly through a long and trying day.
The white-gowned wife of a much-advertised
doctor (by the way, L.L. dropped a modest .£3O
over the Cup, and mourned its loss cheerily) wear-
ing a precipitous metallic hat and accompanied by
some quaintly-clad youngsters and an unobtrusive
stepdaughter, was a prominent figure; while
Mdme. Dejardin looked handsome, foreign, and
animated as usual in blue and black. A Q’sland
visitor sported a gown of yellow glace silk with
pink floral stripes—a really effective garment, had
it not been creased from collar to hem in the most
heartrending manner. I am told that accordion
pleating is all a matter of pressing, and my idea
is that the crumpled damsel aforesaid may have
made some amateur attempt of the kind with the
family mincing-machine.
Tall, girlish Mrs. Isaacs was very soothing in
grey crepon, black satin and white silk. Hubby
kept close to her side all day, his presence recall-
ing the opening of Parliament, where the new
Premier, all in drab-color, conveyed che impression
of a cross between Noah’s dove and a pet rabbit.
He (Mr. Turner) looked aggravatingly meek
and conciliatory—as if he wag saying, “ When my
fall comes, which I almost hope will be soon, don’t
say I was proud in the day of my power, because
I’m trying all I know to show what a mild little
mouse I am.” Slim Mrs. Sylvester Browne
trotted beside her giant spouse in blue, set off by
some good black lace that told of Coolgardie divi-
dends ; and a handsome gown of black and green
was sported by Mrs. Albert Miller, the gold bonnet
of “Mrs. Albert” being also very glorious
when the sun caught it fair in the middle. From
a number of eager remarks passed upon Violet
Varley, I gathered that the glamor of operatic
bridehood dies hard. Tapley’s petite wife—she
promises to be the plumpest of partridges before
she gets into the thirties —looked happy in a helio-
gown (not the best of fits) and Tuscan
hat. Another stage lady much on view was Elsie
Cameron, a substantial embonpointed vision in
pink and grey. Wherever Elsie went, her chum,
Mrs. Ernest Brodribb, was also bound to go. The
holiday appearance of Mrs. E. B. took one’s
thoughts back to the time when “plunger” Brod-
ribb was himself a conspicuous promenader. I
didn’t see the good-natured little hubby on Tues-
day—indeed, he is back in the arid West hunting
for another fortune, I hear.
As a loyal Melbournian, I blush to admit that
Cup Day, despite all said and done, was only a
respectable ghost of its old historic self. After
luncheon, when Lady Hopetoun, putting herself
in charge of a diminutive, infantile Johnnie in a
long frock-coat, descended from the State-box and
made her way through the throng, the show on
the Lawn nearly set me weeping. Where could
one note to-day such dressing as used to thrill or
stagger us when Lady Loch ruled the roast ? The
falling off in the number of paraders was as pain-
fully evident as the huge reduction in splendour.
Carriage parties in the luncheon paddock made a
comparatively feeble muster, and every seat on
the Lawn had standing room to spare while the
race of the year was happening. I couldn’t see
the Maribyrnong Stand at this supreme moment,
but an hour earlier it was a superfluous structure,
tenanted by not more than twenty disconsolate
creatures who, as I imagine, desired a far-off
place to ruminate in.
As soon as Patron had won the Cup a cloud of
woe settled upon the occupants of the grand-stand.
The greatest and the least of the merrymakers
seemed to feel the prevailing depression. Me-
thinks I can still see Excellency Hopetoun peep-
ing at a cold world from under the rim of a hat
tilted forward to shade his eyes, whilst the
Countess sat with crossed knees and folded arms,
as though defying Fate to do anything much
worse than this.

The London Literary World of Oct.
5 republishes “Rolf Boldrewood’s” acknowledg-
ment to Louis Becke, and remarks that it is “a

The S.M. Herald’s statement that F. A,
Morgan, ex-Mayor of Rockhampton (Q.), who
died last week from the effects of a paralytic
seizure, “ was one of the discoverers of the famous
Mount Morgan mine,” is notoriously unhistorical.
Some of those Melb. “ society ” girls and
youths who are in the habit of attending the
Princess’ amphitheatre in a party, democratised
themselves still further on Cup day, when they
hired a van and drove to the Flat in true Colling-
wood style.
The two German skin-buyers, the brothers
Munk, who committed suicide by shooting at the
Oxford Hotel, Sydney, left a cheque for .£5O to

signature of a dead man.

It was clearly demonstrated by the recen

Dear Bulletin, —The report of that
Maoriland tragedy sets one thinking of the report
of another murderous assault on three men, in
Queensland, some years ago. The sworn evidence
on that occasion set forth that Morgan was struck
on the head, that Johnson was struck on the bal-
cony, and that John Whalen was struck on the
24th inst. Whalen died, if I remember rightly, so
evidently the 24th inst. is a vital spot. Yours,
&c., Titus Salt.
From the Star’s (Sydney) report of the
latest Melb. wife-murder Toner resided m
the house with his wife and a blackfellow and his
mistress. He returned home and had an alterca-
tion with his wife, and in his mad passion seized
the shoemaker’s knife from the table and com-
mitted the deed. The mistress of the blackfellow
was powerless to interfere.” What an epitaph :
“ Killed in the presence of a blackfellows
mistress.”
A Ballarat (Vic.) bench has decided that a
man who sold to a local pawnbroker a silver-gilt
chain, which the wretched Mosenstein paid for as
gold, has committed no offence because he didn b
actually say it was gold. He simply kept silent
and lay low, and there is nothing about lyiner low
in the Act. Yet in the same city a silent China-
man, who sold a leaden brick neatly gilt over, is
now doing two years. And how does the new
reading of the law apply to a man who silently
passes a bogus sovereign or a forged cheque?
Mrs. Mellon, despite all said to the con-
trary, is in the best of health, and will within the
next few days hold a private seance, to which only
a few of the'” faithful ” have been invited. There-
after, she proposes submitting to a thorough test,
the conditions of which have been mutually agreed
upon between the medium’s husband and a certain
committee. Mrs. Mellon has any quantity of
assurance, and says she will either stand or fall by
the test seance ; but feels sure when it is over
that she will be “triumphantly vindicated.”
“Great embarrassment is being caused in
the Cabinet by the conduct of Mr. Frederick Sar-
good, both in his place in Parliament and by his
utterances outside,” snorts Melb. Age. The
impossible soft-goods colonel will have to gather
up his cocked hat and go, one of these days. He
glories in the idea of doing it, too. Sargood has
informed the Leg. Council that if the one man
one vote question ever comes up he will oppose it,
and may even resign as before. Nobody will care
whether he resigns as before, provided that the
calamity occurs soon.
There is one Vic. officer who is glad at the
departure of Major-General Tulloch. This swash-
buckler and Tulloch, the story goes, were never
friends after a snub the General administeted
when he first arrived. The warrior entered
Tulloeh’s room at the barracks one day, whistling
gaily, and called out in his bluff way, ‘ Good
morning, General.” “Who are you? ’ enquired
the General. “I am Colonel was the
reply. “Oh, then, Colonel, when I want you, I
shall not whistle for you.” This was firing low
and laying him out! The Colonel nursed that
snub, and Tulloch was rather proud of having ad-
ministered it.
Old John Walter, of London Times, news
of whose death is cabled, owned Printing House
Square and the machinery with which the
Thunderer is printed. Although the Times is
now owned by a company, John Walter re-
tained the controlling power. He owned three-
sixteenths of the shares of the paper, and
other members of the Walter family own eleven-
sixteenths. Two-sixteenths only were held by
outsiders. When he was in America, some years
ago, Walter admitted that the circulation of the
paper was only 50,000 a day. It was the late
John Walter who first introduced the system
of multiplying stereotype - plates for printing
newspapers, and also the cylindrical form of print-
ing presses by which a roll of paper can be printed
on both sides at once. One of the young Walters
was in Melbourne awhile ago, and is now in
Maoriland seeking health. He is a Theosophisb.
Sydney Daily Telegraph emits a fierce
and joyful whoop because Vie. Premier Turner,
alleged Protectionist, says nothing about Protec-
tion in his budget. Yet it also “goo-goos” with
satisfaction because N.S.W. Premier Reid, cham-
pion Freetrader, says nothing about Freetrade in
his budget. This would be curious enough if the
two issues claimed to be on similar footings. But,
whereas Freetrade is idealised as an “ eternal
principle”—a sort of essence of the_ “justice-
though-the-heavens-fall ” verity,” an incumbent
duty to be fulfilled at any cost and no matter how
many victims are sacrificed, while Protection is
only’categorised as a policy of expediency, the
incidence of which must be varied according to
the various needs of the community, it is more
curious still. For, it is evident that there may
exist a nation so peculiarly placed that Freetrade
would be its policy of expediency. Or there may
exist a people so judiciously protected that its
financial pilot has no need to introduce further
protective variations. But, if Freetrade is at once
a humane and quasi-religious duty (as alleged by
the D.T. ad nauseam) and a universal panacea for
all political difficulties (as also reiterated by that
organ), Reid’s action in even temporarily main-
taining the present N.S.W. Protective duties can-
not be justified, and the plea of keeping “dirty
water until he gets clean ” is a meaningless flower
of rhetoric.
The suicide in Melbourne, last week, of
Major A. Russell Inglis (husband of one of the
daughters of a very celebrated doctor) recalls
memories of the Melb. Cup of ’73. Russell Inglis
was then an articled clerk in the office of a Melb,
legal firm; and James Wilson, who was one
of his bosom friends, consented to run “ Don
Juan” (which Inglis had bought privately) for the
Cup. “Don Juan” won, and Inglis and Joe
Thompson scooped no end of money. It was
this win that made Thompson, and to celebrate
the event he built a mansion in East Melbourne,
which he called after Byron’s amorous hero.
Inglis retired from the law and went in for
squatting. His suicide coming so soon after this
year’s Cup suggests one thing pretty plainly—
that his good fortune of 21 years ago was not re-
peated—though his bad turf luck was probably
not his only reason for killing himself.
The Bulletin Christmas Number, to be

miscellaneous joy into it as 44 pages will hold.

The Melb. Age reporter was struck by the
comparative sombre character of feminine ap-
parel at the Vic. Parliament opening For
instance : “Lady Hopetoun wore a pale-green
dress with a pink scarf, and a straw hat trimmed
with black ostrich feathers, and so in dress was in
harmony with the general quietness.”
Many persons and. newspapers confounded
Dean McCarthy, killed in Red fern railway acci
dent, with the burly Father “Tim” McCarthy,
the friend of Archbishop Folding, who did good
work in the Carcoar district in the bushranging
days. Yane, the ’ranger, stuck him up uninten-
tionally and then surrendered to him. Father
“Tim,” after a dispute with Archbishop Yaughan
over a funeral oration upon Dr. Folding, went to
Ireland and died in his sister’s house in Cork.
Ere departing for ’Ome to the blare of
trumpets and the beat of drums, Major-General
Tulloch, Victoria’s ex-commandant, lectured on
the passing of the children of Israel through the
Red Sea, and proved the truth of the Mosaic story
to the complete satisfaction of the Argus. The
“ Majah ” founded his little song on the fact that
he once saw a shallow lake blown away by a steady
desert wind, and, he said, a similar wind blowing
from the East would produce “ exactly the effect
represented ”in the Bible. Exodus says, “ And
the waters were a wall unto them on their right
hand, and on their left.” The wind that would
keep two such walls standing would have blown
the children into the heart of Africa. The faith-
ful aren’t grateful to Tulloch for trying to explain
away their favorite miracle. The harder a thing
is to believe, the more credit the truly pious find
in believing it,
The Vic. Council has commenced to gnash
its store-teeth at Turner’s programme, C. J.
Ham demands stringent instead of
rigorous taxation, and talks, with tears in his eyes,
of suburban property which is being “ sold for the
mere rates,” and people who offer to break stones
in lieu of rates they cannot pay. Those people, as
it happens, will not be hurt by the proposed land-
tax, whilst those others who will get wounded in
their tenderest spot are not likely to ask for n
stone-breaking job—but no matter. The joke is
to hear Ham, of all people, spouting thus ; for Ham
was one of the chief creators of unearned increment
(mostly bogus, as it now appears) in the boom-
time. He was one of those who valued the big
properties, and solemnly declared that a man who
bought 50 acres of land in 1887 was about .£50,000
the richer by his purchase in 1888. Perhaps he
would have been, if he could have realised. The
careers of land-auctioneers and dealers have been
one everlasting argument in favor of a stiff land-
tax.
Sydney jobbing printers’ strike has begun
to fizzle. It’s a pity ; but what can the men do!
The offices are filled with “rats,” who are
rapidly learning to be useful, and the great hog-
public (including N.S. \V. Railway Commis-
sioners, by the bye) follows its snout to the
cheapest market. In the early days of the strike,
when a 25-sheet poster came into an office where
25 raw hands were employed, three men were
started on the job, but, after they had struggled
for an hour, the whole 25 were on it. They
took a show of hands as to the best way
to set it, and the majority decided to
lay it all out on the floor. And they
did—2s sheets of it, one man to a sheet.
Probably they’d have tried to lock it up
on the floor as one forme, only the office hap-
pened to be out of 25-sheet poster chases. But
these things don’t happen every day ; and even
the yarn about another bright importation who
thought it a waste of time to take off the page-
cord before locking up a job—didn’t the cord act
as a buffer and save the type from being battered
by the furniture? —has failed to revive the
flagging spirits of the strikers. Nothing has come
of the co-operative project, and the chances are
the strike will die by degrees for want of breath—
and bread. It’s a pity ; but what can the men do?
Dear Bulletin, — What’s the use of prating
about “ written instructions ” when cut-throat
competition, both for steamer-trade and steamer-
billets, is going on, and a captain may think,
however erroneously, that it’s as much as his post’s
worth to make a slow passage? Suppose yourself
a captain, called into the manager’s office, and
this colloquy following :—Manager : “ I see you
were four hours late last trip, Capt. Nautilus?”
Captain : “ Yes, sir ; the weather was very thick,
and I couldn’t pick up the lights, and, as you
know, the instructions tell us to look to safety
first, and .” M.; “Oh, yes, to be sure, the
instructions. But, how is it that Oceanicus
managed it with his boat? It gives the opposi-
tion a bad lead, you know, Nautilus.” 0. :
“Well, sir, he must have taken a lot of risk.”
M.: “ He got there all right, anyhow, and it will
seem strange to the public that our boat can’t do
as much. The reputation of the line must be kept
up, you know —nothing people hate worse than a
slow boat. That will do, Mr. Nautilus.” A
month elapses, and the captain is again called up.
M.; “Look here, Nautilus, it seems only last
week that you kept the boat for a bit of
mist or something, and here she’s six hours late
again—this won’t do, you know. Here’s Oceani-
cus starts at the same time as you and gets in six
hours ahead.” C.: “Well, sir, you know he has
the devil’s own luck, and our instructions
M.: “Oh, damme, don’t put the blame on the in-
structions ! How do you think Oceanicus does it ?
If he can, I suppose you can, and that’s the long
and short of it. These slow trips are killing the
company. You’ve got a good boat —better than
his, and—however, perhaps you’ll show it. Good
morning, Capt. Nautilus.” Then that captain
goes out muttering an oath and vowing he’ll let
her rip next time. And she does rip.—Sailor-
man.
Literary men, as well as' artists and men
who have to think much, arejconsiderably given
to the love of tobacco —to wit, R. L. Stevenson,
Rudyard Kipling and Prince Bismarck, French
statesmen form the exception. Marshal Mac-
Mahon had to abandon it for the sake of his
health; Carnot for his wife’s sake; and Thiers
never used tobacco. But it is only fair to add
that they did not live to see the birth of the
Cavour cigars. Smokers are more fortunate in
that respect here in Sydney, where this refreshing
and fragrant smoke is obtainable everywhere.
They are sold in packets of eight for Is.
The Melbourne Cup of 1894 was won as
much by the jockey as by the horse. Dawes was
not in a hurry with his mount, and, riding with
great nerve and judgment, never troubled him
until a mile and a-half had been travelled, when,
with consummate judgment, he worked him into
an excellent position. He handled the son of
Grand Flaneur with great skill, brought him on
just at the right moment, and catching flying
Devon, wore him down in the last twenty strides.
“It’s dogged as does it,” and the best man is the
man that can pound the longest. Who knows how
the great race would have gone had Dawes got
flurried, or had his splendid nerve not been
strengthened and perfected by that miraculous
stimulant and sustainer, Marshall’s Tonic Nei vine?

Tas. Governor Gormanston (says a

N.S.W. Justice Foster—who has just had
a year’s leave of absence on full pay—is now
applying for more leave. The almost immediate
end of the matter doubtless will be that this gen-
tleman, who, considering his legal mediocrity,
milk-and-water character, advanced age, and
physical infirmity, ought never to have been ap-
pointed to the Bench at all, will retire on a life-
pension of £lBOO a year in consideration of having,
for seven or eight years, been so kind as to draw
£2600 a year whether he was on leave in Europe
or not. The next N.S.W. Supreme Court Judge
should be a man of well under 50 years, certified
by a big life-assurance co. to have before him at
least 15 years’ expectation of vigorous work. The
community sympathises with Mr. Justice Foster
in his bad health, but it is not prepared to sympa-
thise with him or anybody else to the extent of
£36 per week pension, which he has not haP
earned.

As it was Prince of Wales’ birthday, 14

They all do it, and some of them do it in
a hurry. N.S.W. Premier Reid, only a month or
two in office, has already had a life-sized portrait
of himself painted—for Sydney National Gallery,
so it is indicated in the Ministerial organ. The
extreme modesty of this move, likewise the dip-
lomacy thereof, will be evident to the meanest
intelligence.
A lately-deposed Melb. pen-lady returned
her cards of invitation to the race-week functions
at Govt. House. Secretary Wallington wrote
acknowledging the lady’s courtesy and said : “His
Ex. and Lady Hopetoun would be glad to extend
the invitations to you privately but can see no
record of your name in the visitors’ book.” He
had only looked back a month for her name.
Etiquette of this kind is the very breath of Govt.
House nostrils. Society and the public are
curious to see if the next Governor is going to in-
sist on the visitors’-book farce. The Lochs didn’t,
though they entertained much more than the
Hopetouns. But Lady Loch went for the Popu-

Mr, E. J. Ball, formerly M.P. for Goul-
burn in N.S. W. Assembly, and twice Mayor of
Goulburn, died last week. He was a barber by
trade, and not above his business, for when Lord
Augustus Loftus visited Goulburn as Governor,
and was received in state by the local corporation,
H.E. recognised in Mayor Ball the tonsorial
artist who had scraped his chin earlier in the day.
Adelaide society people are commencing
an agitation against little Sammy Way
ing Kintore unless he becomes a Benedict. The
S.A. Chief-Justice is here confronted with a
serious problem, and those who profess to know
him well are much confounded as to how he will
settle it. It is not so easy for every bachelor to
get married, for there are bachelors amt bachelors.
Mr. Thornton Bulmer, the young
barrister killed in the Sydney railway
accident, was the only grandson of the
veteran George Thornton, M.L.C.
During Hancock’s last term in
Yic. Parliament, he remarked, re the
bank crisis, that all necessary to start a
bank was “ a hook-nose and a counter.”
Just before his last contest at Foots-
cray he arranged for the hire of a local
hall for .£l, and the proprietor, a Jew,
inquired his name. “ Hancock,” replied
John. “Hancock! John Hancock!”
yelled the infuriated Hebrew. “Hook-
nose and a counter. I know. Well,
you can’t have this ’all under 305.”
John declined, and held an open-air
meeting instead. That Semitic land-
lord is now despised by the rest of his
race for allowing personal feeling to
interfere with “pishness.”
Dear Bulletin, Don’t you
think the fascinating Mrs. Besant quite
overdoes the photo, business ? I have
seen about a score of different** studies ”
of the gifted priestess, and they smack
of mummery and advertising, and give
proof of the fact that A.B. is not
superior to one little womanly weak-
ness at least. In the portraits that have
come under my notice the subject wears
many different expressions—the ma-
ternal, the pensively thoughtful, the
intense, and the alert being most
favored ; and the query naturally arises,
does the photo, artist follow Mrs.
Annie about, and catch the expressions
as they occur, or does the lady qualify-
ing for a Mahatma go to a studio in
cold blood, like Mrs. Brough, and de-
liberately assume expressions to order ?
—S. S.
J. Ednie Brown, whose name was kept in
type in half the newspaper offices in N.S. Wales
until the Slattery regime, has, for the present,
abandoned all hope of re-entering the Forestry
Department of N.S. W., and has gone to Westralia
in the employment of a private firm. If Parkes
regains power, however, Mr. Brown will look east-
ward once more.
According to the papers of one recent day
Elijah Cockroft was to be hanged, Weymouth Wash
has got off with 10 years’ hard, and Reginald de
V. Egremont has been committed for trial. Any
person who wants to know what kind of a name
not to give to his son can find a valuable hint
just here.
Other denominations, it is
plain, make of the Wesleyan a
cuckoo nest, to educate their
parsons,
Henry Parkes’ latest fare-
well to Parkes (N.S.W.) ; “ Con-
sidering the huncertainty hof

then the patriarch rushed back
to Sydney to “ hopen ’is hears ”
to proposals that he should ’ead

Mr. Frank Donohue is pre-
paring in London a book entitled
“Early Austral Adventurers,”
a special feature of which, we
read, “ will be what he calls his
* discovery ’ of De Quiros, whom
he is making the hero and the
Christopher Columbus of Aus-
tralia, De Quiros turns out to
have been a most interesting
personality. He was ,the first
gallant figure among the early
voyagers to catch the eye, as
Australia emerged from the dim
region of fable. The discovery
of Australia was the dream and
idie fixe of his lifetime.” Mr.
Donohue, who has lately been
attached to the S.M. Herald
editorial staff, will be remem-
bered as “ Arthur Gayll,” au-
thor of The Bulletin’s “ His-
tory of Botany Bay.”
Sydney Evening News editor Hogue,
member for Glebe in N.S.W. Assembly, is court-
ing local popularity with a vengeance, and is now
a never-failing chairman at Bands of Hope, cold-
water spreads and mothers’ meetings. When the
parson tells of the boy who was born in the slums,
and died a millionaire because he never drank
anything stronger than water and weak tea, James
smiles angelically.
A somewhat sycophantic pressman with
an ambition to do solid work has compiled some
pages on ‘‘Great Men I Have Known,” among
whom are Parkes and Gladstone. Fishing for
materials lately he informed Parkes, at the end of
a long interview, that be proposed heading a
particular section with “The Australian Glad-
stone.” The old man held up a finger and pro-
cured a pause. “ Wouldn’t it be better,” he
inquired slowly after a minute’s silence, “ to put
something else instead of that and to head the
Gladstone section with ‘The English Parkes?
It is not many months since The Bulletin
had to contradict a report, then current, that
Gabriel Read, discoverer of the Otago goldfields,
was dead. Now it has to record the demise of the
veteran, on Oct. 31, at New Norfolk (Tas,), where
also he was born. Through the old man’s life—he
was over 70 when he died —ran a heavy vein of
sadness, for he suffered from an intermittent
mental malady, the result of a fall on the hunting-
field in his youth, which at times took charge of
him and drove him to extremes of violence and
eccentricity. The full consciousness of his defect.
A Coolgardie Celebrity : WARDEN FINNERTY,
which Read possessed, was always a black cloud
over his life, and haunted him till his death. He
died among kind friends, who smoothed the way
to the country where a prospector pegs out once
for all.
It isn’t generally known that Sleafch, M.P.,
was also amongst those who congratulated
OHara on his biffing of Purves.. “Well done,
0 Hara! Hit the brute in a softer place next

after Sleath had been struck on the head with a
ruler by bank-manager Cotton, at Broken Hill,
1 urves was alleged to have sent a similar telegram
to Cotton. Everything comes to him who waits.
The late Martha Needle, it seems, was not
Quite the circumspect widow, or tenderly-affeo-
tionate mother, represented by her counsel. On
the night of her youngest child’s passing hence
she had a little outing with a gentleman. Imme-
diately on her return home, Martha went to the
bedside of her offspring and forced another dose
of physic between the patient’s unwilling teeth.
That was the finishing touch to the mysterious
sickness of Miss Needle, who shortly afterwards
expired.

BACKACHE, &0.,
Take a couple of Fletcher’s Pills every second
night; they are a prompt and sure cure and give
certain relief.
FLETCHER’S PILLS are a quick, sure and
reliable remedy for all complaints arising from
torpid liver, indigestion, weak stomach, and
impurities of the blood. They are prepared on
rational and sensible lines and do not contain a
particle of calomel, gamboge, or any drastic
purgative, but operate by perfectly natural means,
by stimulating the liver and increasing the flow of
bile and thus producing easy evacuations and
natural catharses, without the annoyance and pain
of griping and purging.
Beware of the many harmful substitutes on sale
in many shops. None are genuine unless they
bear the signature of F. Moore, Clements on the
outside wrapper. CLEMENTS TONIC and
FLETCHER S PILLS have become such house-
hold words that imitations are frequently offered.
We contend that this imitation is the sincerest
proof of their virtues, so see that you always get
the genuine, bearing the name and address of F. M.

HOW TO KEEP CHEERFUL.
Cheerfulness is preferable to mirth. Mirth is
an ac t —short and transient. Cheerfulness is a
habit of the mind—fixed and permanent. A
cheerful man is not only disposed to be affable
and obliging, but raises the same good humor in
those who come within his influence. You cannot
help liking him. People endowed with cheerful-
ness should take care how they cultivate it, or,
like a delicate plant, it will wither. They, on the
contrary, foster their happy inclinations by
smoking Frossard’s Cavour Cigars, which are as
pleasant as their own temper, and as aromatic as
the finest havanas, although costing one shilling
only for a packet of eight.
For 15d. in stamps will be posted from

POLITICAL
POINTS
Jn a Democracy there should be but one
capitalist —the Democracy.—C.
The bitter insult that the Argus now
slings at Protectionists is “ tariff tories !”
Sydney D.T. is hereby thanked for the
new party name “ Free-traitor.” It is a fine
sample of a fool who nicknames his own folly.
From the new land-tax Tasmanian Trea-
surer received, in one month, .£36,000. Not more
than this amount was collected for the whole of
’93. *
Stated that millionaire Angas has in-
directly an interest in several S. A. country papers
which have lately “ turned dog ” on Liberalism
and now bray with the National Ass.
Opposition leader Downer (S.A.) was very
chirpy last week. A Ministerial supporter
deserted Kingston, and Downer therefore had a
solid phalanx of six votes behind him !
Already the London-born “South Aust.
0o.” has (bona-fide) sold £50,000 worth of its
lands to dodge Kingston’s progressive taxes. And
this was the tax that “could easily be shifted on
to the poor man !”
It is interesting to learn that Bellamy’s
"Looking Backward ” was introduced to the
notice of Q. readers by Mr. T. E. White, the
low wages National Ass champion. He “ didn’t
know it was loaded.”
N.S.W. Railway-Commissioner Eddy’s im-
pending departure is viewed with joy by the rail-
way-leasing and tram-grab crowd, and constitutes
a source of uneasiness to the upholders of State
ownership and direction.
The statement that Manager Wynne, of
Sydney D.T., will shortly be called to N.S.W.
Legislative Council is all flam, as the articles of
association of the Sydney D.T, co. wisely provide
that no M.P. shall be on the board.
The Yic. Cabinet ordered a special number
of the Government Gazette to be issued, con-
taining the announcement of the death of the
Czar. Isaacs was the only member who opposed
this stupid and expensive piece of folly.
Varney Parkes is resigning the Chairman-
ship of N.S.W. Public Works Committee, and
threatens some interesting disclosures of the
methods of that body when the report concerning
Pyrmont Bridge comes before the House.
Glassey reprobates, in Q. Parliament, the
idea of spending public funds to help back the
unrealised ideals from Paraguay, on the ground
that there are worse off realities in Queensland.
Glassey’s position is an interesting instance of
sympathy with a cause masquerading as antipathy
to its promoters.
Sydney Telegraph, in last
Frday’s leader, states —what is
quite true—that Premier Turner
does not propose to interfere in
any way with the existing pro-
tective tariff in Victoria. Then
a few sentences further on :
“Next to the manner in which
the new Vio, Government turns
its back on Protection the most
striking feature about these pro-
posals,” &c. Moral, maintain-
ing Protection is turning your
back on it. And maintaining
Freetrade is ?
Says Zeal, M.L.O. (Vic-
toria): “If the railways were
leased to-morrow they could be
worked at one - half the cost,
with one-half the labour, and
double the profit at present ob-
taining” (Cheers). Which, if it
were true—of course, it isn’t
true—only means that they
would be worked at one-half the
cost, said cost representing
money spent in Victoria ; with
one-half the labor, so that only
one-half the wages would be
spent in Victoria; and at double
the profit, which profit would be
taken out of the country to pay
divs. to an English syndicate.
At present, by the way, the Vio.
railways yield no profit at all,
and twice nothing is how
much ? And, just here, it
occurs to The Bulletin that if
Zeal were leased to a syndicate
which had absolute power over
him he would probably do about
six times the work he has
hitherto done, and at much less
than half the cost, and would
Produce 32 times the profit he
has hitherto realised. Leasing
the railways also means leasing
the railway employes, and that
18 just as moral as leasing Zeal
to someone who would probably
"se him for brick-carrying pur-
poses for 16 hours per diem.
The God-fearing man is not heard very
huioh of in the present N.S.W. Parliament.
Evidently he only sounds the loud timbrel prior
to elections on the principle, vox populi vox dei—
* the votes of the people are the votes of God.”
The Vic. Government, according to Min-
ister Sargood, will stake its existence on cutting
down the high duti es. That’s where the political
bantam shows his ignorance. He’s the thing who
"dll be cut down if the Government wishes to live.
Returns indicate that the bottom has nearly
fallen out of three more Vic. village settlements.
The Leongatha settlement, during last year, earned
•£54 by the sale of vegetables, and cost .£5BOO.
About £5OOO came in the shape of Govt, grants
3nd loans and public contributions, and the rest
seems to have been mo-tly the original capital of
the settlers. The Tucker village settlements, at
Ee l Hill and Wonwondah, are now valued, with
a h improvements, at .£2lOO, and unless the State
comes to the rescue they are likely to be seized
and sold by .£5OOO worth of bowellesa creditor.
The idea of capturing the city unemployed and
taking him out to a patch of indifferent land, there
to grow turnips by instinct, may be pastoral and
benevolent, but it pays no dividends.
“ There never was a time when men of
business capacity were more required in the As-
sembly than now,” says Thk Argus. The ca-
pacity of the Melb. business man is equal to all
he can grab. Why not write it down “ ra-
pacity?”
Premier Turner (Vic.) absolutely shone on
his Budget, capsizing all the anticipations of the
Patterson crowd. There was the one indispens-
able quality of lucidity, and Turner, at a bound,
leaps into the position of Victoria’s heaven-sent
financier. Even the Argus is charmed.
Tonkin’s Amalgamation of Legal Profes-
sions Bill, down for second reading on Dec. 4 in
N.S.W, Assembly, may be worth passing, but as
regards its claim to cheapen law for the public
one need only look at Queensland, where Lumley
Hill carried a similar bill with a similar claim a
dozen years ago.
One mischief about the pensioner is that
he enters into unfair competition with people in
business. A horde is turned loose by the Vic.
Government to recruit the assemblage. They
have more than enough to live on, but yet perforce
must dabble in trade, because comparatively few
are men past work.
Is Australia as drunken, and France as
sober, as Max O’Rell asserts? According to
“Mulhall’s Statistics,” the consumption of all
kinds of liquor in France is equivalent to 3 - 5 gals,
alcohol per inhabitant per annum—more than in
any other country in the world ; while in Aus-
tralia it is only I'2 gals.
“If England demand taxation without
representation,” says Edmund Barton, “then
Australia might claim independence.” Bub Bar-
ton favors the appointment of a Governor-General
by England, acting solely on her own motion, and
paid for by taxation of the Australian people.
That comes close to the given hypothesis.
In apparent contrast to the Pitt-town
(N.S.W.) labor settlement is the progress made
under the Queensland Co-operative Communities
Bill. Minister for Lands Barlow (no friendly
critic) speaks in high terms of the work done and
progress made at all the settlements save two.
But several of the Q. settlements are bound firmly
by religion.
N.S.W. Premier Reid has promised to
demonstrate his economising hona-fides by intro-
ducing the Maoriland method of voting the Sup-
plementary Estimates, Ministers are to be limited
to .£50,000 for “unforeseen expenditure,” and are
to be personally liable for any sum they may spend
over and above the allowance and without Parha-
tary sanction.
When the present N.S.W. Premier, G. H.
Reid, first came over to democracy—about the
time the solid club plural-vote was knocked out in
East Sydney—he cast about for some action to
prove the genuineness of bis conversion. “ I have
it!” said he, after much thought; and he forth-
with drew his parliamentary salary, which up to
then he had scorned.
Ex-Premier Dibbs got a letter the other
day from an enthusiastic supporter, enclosing 12s.
6d. to defray the cost of those 50 Hansards which
he got gratis from N.S.W. Govt. Printing Office
and distributed at Tamworth during his election
campaign. Among other things, the writer states
he admired George’s sturdy “independence,”
“
VANISHING POINT.-IT COULDN'T GO ON
FOR EVER.
whereat Dibbs cursed Hansard, elections, and
supporters in general.
National Defence League, banks, financial
institutions, and the general champions of pro-
perty have used, and are using, all kinds of
influence to secure the defeat of the Taxation Bill
by the S.A. Legislature. They roped in several
Assembly waverers, and in tbe Council managed
to “stiffen” some alleeed Liberals. However,
up to date, the measure still lives.
Sydney Daily Telegraph
The announcement of a definite date for tariff changes
and direct taxation to come into force, has inspired
confidence.
Does the Telegraph wish to kill the Reid Govt. ?
It would seem so. “ Inspired confidence !” The
phrase stinks. Anyone who deliberately “inspires
confidence,” nowadays, deserves gaol.
S.A. declines to accept the 2d. rate of
postage to England, because she cannot afford the
consequent loss of .£lOOO per year. That sounds
rather paltry —still the general public would get
greater benefit from the reduction of the local
postage than in the saving of on their foreign
correspondence. An agitation for Id. postage
within the limits of Adelaide has already begun.
Among the N.S. Wales M.’sP. who made
most fuss about the alleged employment of ex-
members of the late Parliament in Govt. Depart-
ments, was one man just re-elected who himself
got a Govt, appointment after a former defeat,
and resigned it to run for Parliament. Had ho
been defeated he would, in all probability, have
retired to his snug billet until another election
came round.
Isaacs has a Bill before Vic. Assembly
providing that clothing, tools, and bedding up to
the value of .£2O shall be exempt from distraint
for rent. The more equitable proceeding would
be to abolish distraint for rent altogether, but

“Now, look here, Cohen, you've got my watch and chain and overcoat,
and you've got my wife's false teeth. Can't yon lend us a
trifle on our appetites ? "
Isaacs’ idea is, at all events, a step in the right

N S W. Premier Reid hit two political
birds with one stone, the other day, when he
refused to allow a Cabinet colleague to introduce
an anti-liquor bill, stigmatising the Premier who
nermits a bill to which he is opposed to be so
introduced as a mere trickster and dodger. Dibbs
and Kidd with the Local Option Bill and_ Parkes
and Garrett with Payment of Members Bill were
hit in vital spots. ”

unpardonable sin against democracy.
Captain Pursey Chirnside — the deah boy—
is distinguishing himself in Vic. Parliament chiefly
bv wearing a different-colored shirt at every
sitting of the House. The young man was a study
when Premier Turner was introducing his Budget,
and gibbeting the holders of large estates who
did not make proper use of their land. Pursey
arranged himself elegantly along a bench, shot his
cuffs in a most patrician manner, and ran a super-
cilioua and superior smile up to the mast-head.

Perfectly convincing if the British tax-payers

of disestablishment from a fatted Bishop s point
of view.
Dear Bulletin,—How is it that even
Parkes never noticed that payment of members
would play ducks and drakes with the Constitu-
tion? Bagehot, the foremost authority, says the
Americans tried to copy the English Constitution,
and succeeded in producing a far different one.
Through their representatives the English people
can turn out a Ministry. In ninety-nine cases onb
of a hundred Aberdeen would have been a better
Prime Minister than Palmerston. But the him-
dredth case, the Crimean crisis, arose, and “ the
Amerite.
This would i n i PF during a fixed
S 4 italtoir.rSi, I* people
would have tur A out his successor if they had
the power. But they hadn’t, and were forced to
wait years to do what the English did in as
many days. Now, payment of members tends to
keep the' Ministry in power until Parliament
expires, and thus produces the effect noted by
Bagehot.—Z.

will keep {that
Act 6 of his
around Austra-
lia’s neck for
long to come.
The difficulty is
that if George’s
Act be repealed,
an Act more
drastic in char-
acter will be
thereby revived;
and if, again,
this other Act
be repealed a
still more fero-
cious ordinance
will come to life,
and so on until
the enactments
of thelleptarchy
arereached. The
clear and only
way out of the
difficulty is to
define exactly
what thepresent
day wants in the
matters covered
by George IV.,
and to pass a
new Act rigidly
within these
lines; but, then,
that is construc-
tive legislation,
and would take
up more time
than any Parlia-
ment is willing
to give to it.
Consequently,
George IV. and
his Act 6 will
continue to be
the millstone
they are.
Dear Bulletin, —Your recent par., com-
paring Moran’s action in W.A. politics with De
Hamel’s, is not warranted when the seamy side of
the latter is shewn up. De Hamel only went in
opposition when he found that he was not to be
included in the first Ministry formed by Forrest
on responsible lines. He put it about that he was
sure of being Attorney-General, and used this cry
to help his return against Thomas Campbell, a
far more sincere and accomplished politician, who
was great for the single Chamber and the referen-
dum. De Hamel will advocate any democratic
measure, no matter how advanced ; and yet, when
he landed in Albany, about six years ago, the
writer was one of a few who had a perusal of his
newspaper scrap alburn, where he proudly exhi-
bited a report, several columns long, of a banquet
tendered him by the Newcastle-on-Tyne Con-
servative Club, full of grateful allusions to his
services to the party. Another big item was his
presentation at Court, and, to emphasise the last,
at the opening of Parliament De Hamel was the
only member in the whole House who appeared in
Court-dress. Heaven help W.A. when she has to
call on such men to lead her. Better borrow
Henry Parkes. —Yours,
BLACKBOY.

RUM AND SENTIMENT
Yesterday morning the Premier received a deputation
representing the Licensee! Victuallers’ Association to
protest against the introduction of a local option bill
without compensate...
Mr, Varney Parkes said literature of every country was
full of traditions of the old business. The old tavern of Old i
England had been one of the oldest associations of all the 1
sentiments of British-speaking people. It would be a very
sad thing, he thought, to destroy that old business from the
opposite sentiment, which said that a man should not drink
and avail himself of the pleasures he had been used to get
in.all generations out of public-houses.

The R.C. nuns are moving very cautiously
towards trousers. At a recent Melb. convent
entertainment some 30 or 40 damsels had to take
the parts of men. Whether huntsman, king,
squire, or knave, each maiden was attired to the
waist in masculine garments, but from the waist
downwards there was a skirt continuation.

The daughter of an eminent Brisbane
citizen and M.L.C. is about to be married. The
lady’s wedding-dress is a perfect marvel of gor-
geousness, and is to be dedicated (in imitation of
a Continental custom) to the church in which the
ceremony is performed as a decoration for the
altar. How will this work when the sex has
donned the breeches ?

The Journal, which is the evening issue
of the S.A. Register, turned its column-rules
and went into solemn black because of the death
of the Czar; but no special mark of mourning
was exhibited over the death of 130 Australians in
the Wai rarapa. Why?

When Women’s Suffrage comes will the
women still retain the first right of entry into the

Maoriland woman-suffrage seems to have brooded

Even in these days of economy vice-

The Bulletin hears that when the S.M.
Herald compositors were informed by the
manager, through their officers, that the Hat-
tersley composing and distributing machine was
to be introduced into the office by Xmas, they
were not much surprised, but they were taken
aback when told that it was intended that girls
were to work the distributors, and that any
employd having a daughter eligible to learn the
work would have the preference. The men cleai ly
perceive the subtlety of the arrangement, which
will prevent the Typo. Society having any in-
fluence over the girls ; it will also, they think, so
reduce wages as to debar men from accepting
employment.
Why do the de-
position - clerks in
Sydney police-courts
read over the evidence
taken down to, say,
constables only, while
the statements of in-
dependent persons are
simply handed, un-
read, to the witnesses
to sign? Three S.M.’s
in the metropolitan
district permit this
unjust practice. Is it
that the constable, or
his superior officer,
who may happen to
be in the box, is part
and parcel of the sys-
tem by which crim-
inals are manufac-
tured ? If the law
says the evidence
taken down is to be
read over to the wit-
ness before he is asked
to sign the deposi-
tion, why does this
anomaly exist ?

“ Out of the
mouth of babes.”
The inquisitive per-
son asked the small
girl, “ Where do you

she’s a Jewess.”
“And what’s your

N.S.W. Judge Windeyer, in re the Te Kloot
case, has decided that it is not fair to refuse a sue-
cessful petitioner his divorce because he has failed
to pay up the costs, said failure arising because
petitioner (who has had to provide his wife with
the cash necessary to carry on the war against
hirnself) had no money of his own, and couldn’t
get his own costs from the insolvent or evanished
co-respondent. Therefore, it is definitely settled
that a divorce isn’t an article of merchandise to be
handed over in return for the costs on the C.O.D.
principle. This may be law but it isn’t business.
That rule absolute should have been put up for
auction to satisfy the sharks unpaid bill Ihere
are any number of people in N.S. Wales who
would pay quite a large sum for a divorce if it
could be had without the usual law proceedings.
’ ' ’ * ‘ ‘ *
Fancy Judge Windeyer auctioning that decree :
“ For positive sale, at the risk of former pur-
chaser, a rule absolute; quite new; never been
worn; constructed of the best materials and
warranted durable; can be altered to suit the
size of the buyer. Cohen—Cohen —Kohn 1 ” Or,
Te Kloot might have been granted his rule abso-
lute with permission to the unpaid alligator of
the law to put in a bailiff and seize it in settle-
ment of his bill. A lawyer can seize pretty nearly
everything else in the wide world for his unpaid
bill, and if he isn’t allowed to seize upon a man’s
divorce then there is obviously sometliing wrong.

Wholesale gambling has been going on in
connection with St. Patrick’s Cathedral Fair
(Melb.). The promoters of “art-unions ” held in
connection with the A. N. A. annual demonstration
were fined by the courts, but the church gambles
for big money prizes are smiled on by the law.
Games of chance, such as are rigorously sup-
pressed by the police on Flemington Flat, are
practised at the fair with perfect impunity ; heaps
of gold and notes are seen on the teetotum table.
It is difficult to understand how what is immoral
in the city and on the racecourse becomes sancti-
fied when pursued in the interests of the professed
teachers of morality. Archbishop Carr and
Barney Allen are really in the very same line of
business when the matter comes to be looked at
squarely.
# * *
That Cathedral fancy-fair ought to pan out
a good div. The race-game is run with 14 sub-
scribers at Is. each, but the winner only gets Bs.
as his prize, 6s. going to the machine. Talk about
the totalisator !

When they asked Martha Needle on the
scaffold if she had any remarks to make, she
replied according to the usual formula ; “ I have
nothing to say.” They always ask if he (or she)
has anything to say, and in the very few cases
where the prisoner has a desire to make a few
observations to the reporters, the law allows him
to get them off his chest without opposition. But
some day or other a prisoner with a few remarks
to make will stand up on the gallows and hold
forth with an easy flow of eloquence for nine
hours, like Jawbone Neild, till the hangman and
the sheriff and the other officials are nearly drop-
ping from fatigue and hunger, and it is too late
to report the execution in the evening papers.
Then they will give up asking if the prisoner has
anything to say.

Anti-cremationists are now busy pointing
out that if the body of Louis Juncken had been
burned instead of being interred, there would
have been no possibility of exhumation, and the
arsenic in the deceased would never have been
discovered. The cremationists point out, on the
other hand, that just because there is no evidence
to be got after combustion, the law, when man’s
destination is ashes instead of dust, will hold a
post mortem on every deceased, and under their
system the poisoning of Juncken would have been
discos'ered long ago, also that of many other per-
sons who haven’t been exhumed and never will
be. Here the cremationists have decidedly the
best of the argument. Everybody ought to be
post-mortemed before burial. For one Juncken

The steamers that go fcn Westralia these
times have their decka loaded forward with
cattle,'sheep, horses, machinery, fodder, and all
manner of cargo. Sometimes there is no deck
space whatever lefb for the stee rage passengers
who have to any exercise they want on top of
the deck-loading. In some cases the boats are
inaccessible, and the gratings which are supposed
to afford air to the stifling mass of humanity
below are partially covered, and in one instance,
according to the report of the Adelaide Marine
Board, even the poop was partly blocked with
sheep-pens and other loading. Apparently there
is all the raw material for a first-class tragedy on
the W. A. coast the first time a respectable cyclone
comes along.

John Selden, who died in 1654, defended
the law against witchcraft on the ground that it
rightfully punished the old women who would
have been witches if they could. Selden s senti-
ments may interest the modern spook fraternity :

that whosoever should turn his hat thrice, and

One N.S.W. Judge, two ex-Minisfcers of
the Crown, one religiously-inclined Under-Secre-
tary, several M.sL.O. and M.sP. were turned
quite silly-side-out by Mrs. Spook-raise Mellon,
and one member of the N.S.W. Legislative Coun-
cil so frequently attended the Mellon seances
that he is now perfectly crazed on the subject.
Every night he goes to bed with a slate under
his pillow, and hopes against hope for a written
message from his dead son. A certain Judge’s
wife was as hopeless a victim as any. Forbidden
by her husband to recognise the Mellons, she
actually continued, while the Judge was on cir-
cuit, bo hold Mellon seances in her own house.
Now that the exposure has come the lady is biting
her fingers. One of the most unfortunate of Mrs.
Mellon’s victims is the legal dignitary who was
so impressed by the manifestations that a year ago
he engineered a J.P.-ship for Mr. Mellon.

The Melb. Institute of Journalists is about

justify its existence, and has not proved of the
slightest use to any mortal pressman. The idea
of making a close profession of journalism was
doomed to failure from the very beginning.

The Mayor proper of a certain large Aus-

of getting his boots satisfactorily soled and heeled
for half-a-crown. For many years he groaned
under the infliction of three shillings for repairs
neatly executed, and awhile ago he transferred
his patronage to a cobbler to hose fee was sixpence
less. Finding, however, that the new man’s soles
were not watertight, the magnate returned to
the other artist with an offer to let him have the
job as of yore at the lower rate. “Mr. Blank,”
said the old reliable bootmender, “the leather
costs one - and - tenpence (unless I give you
brown paper), and do you think eightpence is
fair pay for the labor?” The Mayor, as a right-
thinking person, argued that eightpence was nob
to be sneezed at in times of depression, bub he
finally agreed to bang the odd saxpence.

Undoubtedly one of the lessons of the
Redfern, just as of the Windsor (Vic.) accident,
four years ago, is that locomotives should always
be run funnel, and never bunker, first. In the
latter disaster the driver and firemen undoubtedly
lost their lives by the bunker - first practice.
There should be a turn-table at every terminus, and
a tender between the engine and the train on
suburban trains would also be an additional and
comparatively inexpensive safeguard.

Ex-Premier Patterson enjoyed one little
thrill of rapture on Cup Day. That was when
his nephew George, son of auctioneer Patterson
and brother of Madge Tempest, came rampaging
along the course on a corpulent steed, at the head
of Hopetoun’s military escort. George is a
capting, or something, in the Mounted Rifles, and
by the earnest desire of his himperial uncle, no
doubt, he commanded the troops on this national
occasion. A noble sight was George, holding his
naked sword in a line with the family nose whilst
his Excellency and party climbed in or out of
their barouches. The ex-Premier was proud of
him. The jingo soul of the exploded meat-man
was in arms, so to speak. He glared at the vulgar
democratic multitude, on the Elat, as though
thinking of how nevvy George and his raw troopers
were created to put down insurrections if neces-
sary. George himself is not an unamiable sorb of
assistantauctioneer in plainclothes. With his buck-
ram on, and the safety of the Governor under his
supervision, George is a terrible fellow.

A woman charged her husband in a
Sydney court with getting drunk on Saturday
nights, smashing the furniture and regularly
thrashing her. The man could not get bail for
better behavior and was sent to gaol in conse-
quence. Now the woman is without support. It
thus comes about that a woman married to a
brute must either take her thrashing in silence or
go hungry. In most parts of Germany a man
convicted of such offences is, by local law, allowed
to go to his work as usual, but his wife gets his
wages, and he is locked up only from Saturday
night till Monday. This German way is certainly
a commonsense advance on the Australian way,
and would deserve a trial, if only as a test of
national temperament.

Mrs. Macnamara, the Rue Australian lady
who has been giving “ a piece of her mind ” to
Sydney Star, and putting into practical language
the general complaint of the matesses that Mrs.
Dictator Lane had a nasty way with her, and lin-
gered in luxury at Villa Rica, and wanted a house
of her own (“ with a fence round it, too ”) in order
to keep the common bush female at a distance, is
a told-you-so lady who was hopelessly embit-
tered at the outset by the loss of a large trunk
which held “ all my best silk dresses and my hus-
band’s evening dress clothes,” &c., as she told a
visitor to the Balmain camp. The only comfort
left her was that she had stipulated for the
privilege of teaching her children Scriptural
geography. “ That,” she added, with a dignified
sweep of the hand, “is my strong point.” But it
is evident that Mrs. Macnamara over-rated the
consolations of Scriptural geography. Had she
lost the geography and found the silk dresses
Lane might still have had a devoted disciple. Silk
dresses are a consolation which can never pall;
but there is no solidarity in linsey-woolsey.

A queer story of lovely woman’s inconsis-
tency (which should especially appeal to Sarah
Grandites) was told in a Melb. law-court the other
day. It is the lady’s own sworn narrative, filed
with a view to upsetting a decree nisi. She was
married in ’BB, and lived on pleasant terms with
her husband up to Jan. last, when she left him on
discovering that he was the father of an illegiti-
mate child. Her indignation wouldn’t permit her
to remain under the monster’s roof any longer,
“but she continued to meet him about three
times a week up to March 26 last.” The outraged
wife then agreed to make herself scarce for a time
whilst her husband “took proceedings for divorce
to please his people.” This private contract was
faithfully adhered to by both parties. The hus-
band made out a satisfactory case, which the wife
didn’t dream of defending, and in due course the
nisi was obtained. Petitioner, by the way, pro-
mised to be “good” to respondent, and allow a
quiet 12s. 6d. a week for her support. The couple,
having been divorced as per arrangement, resumed
their little meetings and maintained harmonious
relations until the divorcee's father got hold of the
alleged facts of the case and induced her to apply
for reinstatement in her original conjugal billet.
This story is a warning to wives who impetuously
leave the “old man ” before they are prepared to
dispense with his society altogether, the moral
being that where a woman can’t get a whole man’s
career, past, present, and future, to herself, she
should be prepared to accept a dividend.

Press on, rny sweet!
Till custom’s ramparts fall before your feet,
Till chain and bar
Are broken, and each cynic who would mar
Your work is quelled ;
But there’s one power will never be repelled,
One bond your strong, lithe hands will never rive;
And from Love’s durance, though you strain and
strive
Its bolts to shatter and its walla to shake,
You cannot break.
Grey heights ascend,
Whence Wisdom beckons, or the Muses bend ;
And laurels wear,
Twined in the circlets of your mazy hair;
But seek no more
Higher than my heart’s altitude to soar !
Orlando-taught, I bound your flight, as he
His love’s sweet stature; past this one degree,
Despite the lofty yearning of your eyes,
You cannot rise.
Your knight am I,
To follow where you lead, and to defy
The old, blind world,
Into whose teeth your rebel glove is hurled;
But come what may—
Despair, or dole, or death, in this one fray
We fight not side by side, but face to face ;
Nor shall you pity gain, nor any grace—
War, if you must, with Love; but, warring, know
I am your foe!
You claim your rights,
And with your own my willing voice unites :
Ah, have no fear,
Your cause is mine, to live or die for, dear !
But this alone,
Of all that you demand, I will nob own —
Nay, for I swear by all the powers that be
You have no right to mock at —are not free,
By grant of gods about us, or above,
To banish Love.

“Swag-
man’s Prayer”: —
O, Lord, thou knowest but too well,
The swagman’s life is one long hell,
The rain thou dost from Heaven send
lias flooded every river bend,
The fish won’t take the bait at all
They eat their comrades if they’re small.
My boots are heavy with blue clay,
I’ve knocked off quite a ton to-day ;
I’ve got no work, or even bread !
I’ve got no place (o lay my head.
There are no empty huts around
Where lice, and ticks, and fleas abound.
I’ve got no ’bacca, Lord —or soap.
To wash my shirt there is no hope.
Though Thy son in a manger lay
He’s better off than me, to-day,
For grass-seeds prick me in the leg,
As through the swampy ground I peg,
My matches they are soaking wet—
Another box I cannot get—
My drinking-water’s full of weeds,
My shirt a new tail sadly needs,
My limbs are stiff from humping bluey,
And one of them’s a wee bit skewey.
These are hot trials few of mine,
To which, oil Lord! thy ear incline.
Oh, God ! 1 trust I’ll get a job,
Or some poor devil 1 shall rob.
So stop the rain and stop the flood—
Mosquitoes, too, who suck my blood,
Oh, God 1 then hear the swagman’s prayer
And make a note of it—up there.
General Debility.
The term General Debility means a depletion of
vital strength, a general break-up of the corporeal
health, due to over-consumption and wasting-away
of the life-giving constituents of the blood and
nerve tissue, really a wearing-out of the animal
structure. If your life is worth saving it is worth
your while to treat your case thoroughly. If it is
worth your while to treat your disease at all, it is
worth your while to continue the treatment until
your health is thoroughly re-established ; you may
feel all right after the first few bottles of Clements
Tonic, so prompt are its remedial and curative
effects; but a medicine no matter how good cannot
banish disease in a week, the seeds of the com-
plaint will still remain in your system and break
out afresh if you do not thoroughly eradicate them.
Don’t forget that a relapse is twice as difficult bo
cure as the original attack, so if you want to get
cured give the remedy a fair chance and recovery
is certain. Clements Tonic is a genuine article,
it is prepared for a specific purpose and contains
the material to make it an effectual remedy, and if
used faithfully it cannot fail. We do not claim it
is a cure-all, we do not say it will cure lock-jaw or
bad spelling, bub for all cases of impaired vital
strength it is a scientific and infallible specific.
Moreover, the cost of using it is so small that you
can have a year’s course of it for less than you can
procure a week’s medical attendance, and a tenfold
better remedy than any physician can prescribe
for you. Thousands of cases have been cured by
Clements Tonic, and it will cure you if you give it
a fair chance. Read the case of Mr. Wm. Scott,
manager A.J.S. Bank, Bega, N.S.W., who writes
on April 21st, 1893 :—I have pleasure in stating
that I have from time to time found much benefit
from using your Clements Tonic, which I consider
a really splendid one. As a rifle shot I have found
it useful in clearing the sight and steadying the
nerves. —Yours faithfully, Wm. Scott, manager
A.J.S. Bank, Bega, N.S.W.


The Wild Cat Column.
The latest drop in wheat brings things to such a
fioint that it is estimated it wouldn't pay to grow grain
n England this year even if all the land on whioh it is
produced were rent-free. Also, at present prices the-
bottom must pretty nearly fall out of Australia’s grain-
export trade, and out of that of other countries as-
well. By a curious turn of events the Argentine farmer
Is the man who now has the best of the deal. He sella
most of his surplus in England, and is paid for it in gold.
The gold, when it returns to Argentina, is exchanged for
three times its nominal value in depreciated paper. Said 1
paper is of no value for foreign trade, but for purchases;
of purely local produce it goes almost as tar as it ever did.
Therefore, the Argentine farmer, by reason of his depre-
ciated paper, gets over twice as much for his exported!
grain as he otherwise would. From this standpoint Aus-
tralia badly wants a depreciated paper currency.
• * • •
A scanty item of information which arrives by
cable shows that the London Bank of Australia is doing
none too well. Its profits for the half-year are about.
£7OOO, and £4600 of this goes to pay a div. of 5J percent,
to preference shareholders. The ordinary shareholder*
get nothing, which is the usual fate of such people nowa-
days. The earnings are at the rate of a little over one
per cent, per annum on capital, which is bad enough to
suggest that the London has a very large proportion of its
money locked up in investments which yield no interest
and from which the principal is very reticent about coming
back. The accounts are, however, only a shade worse
than those of the previous half-year, which is, perhaps, a
cause for alleviated congratulation. The London Bank
made a dismally bad bargain for its ordinary shareholder*
when it arranged that preference holders were to have sJ-
per cent. divs. before the ordinary crowd had a show, and
as the result of this contract the chances of the
latter are very remote indeed. Also, it is making
no progress worth mentioning towards creating a
new reserve fund, or doing anything else of a
specially cheering character. The London Bank professed
to be earning over £BO,OOO a year right up to the date of
suspension, and the fact that it dropped immediately after
the suspension to about one-sixth of that amount, and has
continued there ever since, suggests that it was pretty
sanguine in these good old days. With about three ex-
ceptions, there has been, among the resurrected banks,
such an awful discrepancy between their earnings imme-
diately before and immediately after suspension, that the
country is still wondering, and is likely to keep on
wondering, on what possible basis these former big profits
could have been estimated.
« * • «
The average land-boom transaction which turns
up in the courts is eminently calculated to harry the
Bench into an early grave. For instance, it was solemnly
attested the other day before Judge Williams, of Melb.,
that seven years ago the N.Z. Loan and Mercantile Co.
sold a property in Collins-street to the Real Estate Bank
for £210,000. It received £30,000 in cash, £30,000 by
mortgage, and £150,000 by another mortgage. The
£30,000 mortgage was afterwards paid off, and the Real
Estate Bank issued £150,000 worth of debentures, whioh
were guaranteed by the N.Z. L. and M. Co., and with the
proceeds it paid off the £150,000 mortgage, whioh was
then transferred to three trustees as security for the
debenture - holders. Next the land was sold for
£265,000, and the buyer put two more mortgages on it
to the Bank of S.A., and was then sold up by his creditors.
The man who bought the property with the three
mortgages on it was also sold up a little later on. Now
the Real Estate Bank is burst, and so is the Bank of S.A.,
and the old N.Z. Loan and Mercantile is dead, a recon-
structed institution having taken its place, and the pro-
perty, which is mortgaged for over £200,000, is worth less
than half the liability, and the debentures are about
worthless, and all these banks and institutions, and the
two other mortgagors, and the trustees and liquidators of
their bankrupt estates, and sundry other people, all
applied to Judge Williams on the ground that they dunno
where they are, and want to have their respective posi-
tions defined, and to find out what they are to do to each
other. This is the sort of thing whioh makes a judge get
a medical certificate and go off to Europe on 12 months
sick leave.
* « * *
The Permanent Trustee Co. of N.S. Wales seems
to have finally turned the corner, inasmuch as its balance
of profit on hand has increased during the year from £24
to £7BB. The £24 represented six years’ work—a fair
example of the slowness with which the public accepts
new ideas. The Trustee Co., with a capital of £1,000,000,
is immeasurably safer and more reliable as an executor
than any private individual can be, but either the public
realises this very gradually or else those persons who have
appointed the Co. as their executor are a long time
dying. Even now the actual business done doesn’t pay
expenses, and the net profit only represents part of the
interest received on the co.’s own invested capital of
£2s,ooo—the balance of interest having gone to make up
the deficit between receipts and working expenses. In
another year, however, with a reasonable mortality among
clients, the business should yield a substantial profit.
♦ • • •
One financial institution which was sick so long
before it died as to furnish unusual facilities for big
shareholders to stand from under, is having even more
difficulty than usual in finding the people that it wants to
collect calls from. It has just discovered that one share-
holder is a large brown retriever. The man who trans-
ferred his shares to the retriever has left the country, so
the liquidator is denied the pleasure of telling him what
ha thinks about this little flash of humor. What irritates
the ex-board more than anything else is that a certain
comic individual made himself unusually disagreeable at
a meeting some time ago on the strength of holding the
retriever’s proxy.

The City of Melb. Bank offers 5 per cent, in-
terest on calls paid in ad\anoe, and even with that induce-
ment the calls in arrear are now the bigger item of the
two. The item, “ drafts in circulation,” has fallen in 18
months from £227,000 to £74,000—a fair evidence of how
the liquid business is drifting away ; the coin on hand has
diminished from £617,000 to £364,000; the Govt, deben-
tures from £451,000 to £65,000; the reserve of £200,000
has gone altogether; and the miscellaneous assets have
sunk from £4,632,000 to £4,176,000. What a beautiful
fading away it is 1 The gradual and pensive decline of
little Eva is what it most resembles.

Newcastle (N.S.W.) Borough Council, the other
day, floated its electric-lighting loan of £lO,OOO locally
with the Bank of N.S.W., at 4J per cent, for 20 years, each
£lOO debenture fetching £loolss. Which lends additional
point to the clumsy foolishness of Balmain Council,
which sold its whole £59,000 loan at 5$ per cent., without
public competition, to a man named Cohen, and instead
of getting 15s. per cent, premium actually gave Cohen a
large commission for taking the debentures! Saying
nothing of the lost premium and the lost commission,
the difference in interest alone will cost Balmain £ll,BOO.

It is a melancholy fact that no one ever sees a
sovereign In Australia that isn’t brand-new. Australian
sovereigns drift away so fast to England in payment of
rents and interest to absentees, that they never have a
chance to grow old in this country.
• * * *
The reason why the interest on deposits in the
Melb. Commissioners’ Savings Bank was reduced to 3 per
cent, is now apparent. The Savings Bank last year only
earned £3 19s. per cent, on its invested funds. A large
proportion of the money must be sunk in investments
whioh yield little or no interest to account for this fall.

The National Bank directors announce that
they sympathise with the amalgamation movement,
which probably means that they would be glad to take
over the Royal or the Victoria on reasonable terms. But
it doesn’t mean that they want to have anything to do
with the Colonial, or the City of Melbourne. Shiels, who
says in a hollow voice that he is interested in seven re-
constructed banks, and who looks like it, would gladly
see the two comparatively strong Melb. banks take over a
weak one apiece and hold it up, but the National isn’t on.
Even a tolerably sound concern has lots to do in holding
itself up just now.

The reason why many big Melb. solicitors went
to the wall after the boom was simply that their Invest-
ments of trust moneys looked so promising that they
were tempted to do a little on their own account—which
ended in some of them investing their clients’ cash In
their (the solicitors’) own
N.S.W. Supreme Court promises, in future, to
punish any solicitor found mixing his clients’ money with
his own, no matter whether a loss is discovered or not.
* • *
Why does not the Supreme Court, when it
strikes a Gent. One off the rolls, forward notes of the
evidence to the Attorney-General for his consideration?
This is where the legal I9,che comes in. In other matters
where a criminal offence is disclosed in the course of pro-
ceedings the Court sends the evidence for the inspection
of the Attorney-General, and sometimes, as in the case
of perjury, practically calls upon the Crown to prosecute.
In most gent, one cases a criminal offence is disclosed,
and so long as judges limit themselves to striking a
culprit off the rolls they must expect the public to think
that there is one administration of law for the offending
layman and another for the offending lawyer.
Rumored that a big Australian municipal
potentate is “cronk.” Moral: Lay to your book. The
pursuit of aldermanio glory hardly ever crushed a cash
div. in the long run.

why these fresh young investments should take prece-
dence of the old reconstructed risks is not easy to dis-

The two New Australias—the one presided over
by Lane and the one nominally bossed by Kidd—are at
loggerheads over an attempt to settle the accounts.
The Lane crowd, so far as can be understood from
a somewhat confused report of the shindy, is still
legally the owner of the original settlement, and the
settlement owes a large number of debts, therefore
the bosses of the movement demand a mortgage on
the property for the amount of the liabilities. The Kidd
crowd points out that the debts are owing by the associa-
tion to its own members, and that the idea of giving the
Head-Lane crowd a mortgage for the money which it owes
to itself is altogether preposterous. The assets are set
down as £2908 and the liabilities at £5170, and the Kidd
crowd protests that this awful and unaccountable state of
things makes its brain swim. The assertion that the Royal
Tar, which was bought with the association’s money, is
mortgaged to Lane for £2520, apparently makes its brain
swim a good deal worse. Head, on the part of the
Lane crowd, and Gilbert Casey, for the Kidd crowd, are
understood to be wading through the accounts and
explaining these things at great length to each other, with
the result that the balance-sheet of Rue Australia now
looks like a procession of inebriated crabs wandering over
a Chinese picture. To all appearance the discussion gets
no “ forrarder,” and Gilbert Casey’s explanations in the
papers are about the most inexplicable features of the
tragedy. Few men are blessed with the gift of ex-
planation.

Dear Bulletin, —There is one circumstance in
connection with the “scheme” of the Australasian Rights
Purchase Association which you have overlooked, but
which tends to prove that the promoters are anxious to
shut out all chance of future competition. The Grose
and Colo rivers are separate streams, miles upon miles of
country lying between them, and sufficient power to serve
the purposes of the A.R.P.A. could be obtained from
either one or the other of these streams. Is it not plain,
therefore, that in seeking to obtain the exclusive right to
use the waters of both the Grose and the Colo, the syn-
dicators are desirous of establishing a huge monopoly?
If there is money in the concern, as you pertinently re-
mark, why should not the State make it and dump iti into
a depleted treasury ?—Yours, &0., Anti-Shark.

In a letter picked up the other day on one of

favorably in Sydney journals that a rush would set in to
the field at once, thus enabling the prospectors to sell out

A few hopeful Melbournians have formed a

cheap carriage for the coal if they can only find it. The

bore from Korumburra will soon decide whether the
syndicate’s “ little bit of splosh ” (£200) has trickled down

For the first time since Melb. Standard started,
the Herald appeared on the Saturday night following the
amalgamation with only four pages. “The advantages
of a monopoly are obvious,” writes a correspondent. The
Bulletin’s idea of an evening paper (and a morning
paper, too) is four pages. In four pages you can print all
the good, bright news and other matter, and all the
decently-paid advts. procurable. Four pages, if you
know your business, means a small expense, con-
densation, vigor and writing with a knife. Eight pages
means huge expense, maundering, flabbiness, and licking
the boots of the big advertisers. When a vigorous epigram-
matic four-page daily does come along, with a
habit of finding out and telling the truth about every-
thing, especially financial matters, it will make the heavy
eight pagers squeal.

tion assented to. Now, wasn’t defendants’ offence
forgery, pure and simple ? And why should the wretch

nisance of the forger of gun-signatures?

The well-known and modest Fitzgerald Moore
has gone to England to take part, it is said, in the flota-
tion of the alleged Wealth of Nations mine. In view of
current rumours, if the English public take this mine at
anything over 4s. 6d. without having first obtained the
independent opinions of one or two of the best men avail-
able—say, for instance. Prof. Nicholas and Mr. Bratnober,
both of whom are well known in London —they will richly
deserve any misfortunes that may overtake them.
The story goes that hundreds of thousands are
to be asked for the Wealth of Nations—for which very
experienced and reliable men who have visited the field
would not on spec, give £5OOO as a mine to work. This
big-float business is an Australian national question, for
one or two grabs on a rotten basis will, if big enough to
be thoroughly remembersome, “ queer” bona-fide mining
for years, so far as outside capital is concerned. However,
perhaps another half-million or so is neither here nor
there in the present insane Coolgardie scramble, as the
W.A. companies already floated in London cannot pos-
sibly, taken all round, yield investors half-a-crown per
cent, per annum.

An Age writer makes an important error in
comparing the gold yields of S. Africa and Australia. He
states that with a yield of 170,0000z5. per month the
Randt heats U.S.A. as well as Australasia. As the Randt
output is quoted in gross ounces of comparatively low
grade, the comparison is unfair with the high grade of
Australian gold. However, the estimated yields for ’94
actually give Australia a quantity advantage without
reckoning the quality advantage:—
Randt .. .. 2,020,0000 z. gross.
Australasia .. 2,065,0000 z. gross.

With characteristic modesty, that amusing per-

as being recognised as one of “ the leading authorities
in connection with the exploration in Western Aus-
tralia, and as having declined many offers and
inducements to associate himself with other West
Australian mines, in order to keep himself free to
devote all his energies in the interest of this under-
taking ”(a little mine of his own). He is also described
as “ not only an able and experienced, but as a really

Another version (from a Bulletin correspon-

War crushed 200 tons for 16dwt. per ton:—“This is a
good claim, but one-half the gold is lost through want of
water, which could be obtained by having a proper dam.
The water after leaving the ripples is so thick that a brick-
layer could lay bricks with it alone.” Latest returns
show an ostensible improvement.

The alluvial find made in a cement formation
at White Feather is said to be turning out splendid gold,

They are reaping a rich harvest. This is the best defined

true alluvial, but a big cement reef, that will go down.
There is a chance of litigation over the matter, as most of
the ground was pegged out some time ago.

One of the most successful and experienced of
Australian speculators, whose name is a household word
among the mining men of the three eastern provinces,
writes The Bulletin after a visit to Coolgardie: “The
place has come to stay, and all the good things have not
yet been found. Some reefs have been applied for which
will, I am sure, put the sensational ones in the shade in
the long run. It’s only a question of time getting water,
I think, and as it is always blowing half a gale on Cool-
gardie, windmills will be a strong help towards developing
the reefs. But what a lot of duffers are now being cracked
up as good mines 1 Among the promoters of these things
your own common sense and judgment, developed by a
quarter of a century’s experience of reefing on many
fields, go for naught if you listen to the talk. Stone that
shows nothing is cracked up as soz. at least, and some-
times “proved” in a mortar generally in use for pound-
ing up specimens I * Mustard gold ’ is a favorite expression
on the field. You can imagine what that is like, and how
much will be saved by water used more than once 1 At
least 80 per cent, of the leases applied for will be aban-
doned, 10 per cent, more will be fairly tried and found
wanting ; the balance may pay handsomely.”

of Gympie mines, £581,057, an increase for Oct. of
£20,224. (By the way, the Londonderry is being floated
in London for £700,000: Would any sane man give all
Gympie—as a field to be worked—for a dozen London-
derrys, or for all Coolgardie ?) On the present value
Gympie divs., for year to date, pay interest at £32 15s. 6d.
per cent, per annum ; net profits for same period, ascer-
tained by deducting calls from divs., pay £l9 2s. 9d. per

mate it is no more gambling than selling eggs or preach-

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Tedalderman Keys took his Cup “gruel” squeak-
ing. In other words, the owner of the favorite that
finished eleventh lodged a complaint of interference
(promptly dismissed) against the rider of the second horse.
This was a fitting crown to Moran’s wild hypothesis that
he would have got home easily on Ruenalf if Devon hadn’t
‘‘bumped” Nada, who “rolled against” Taranaki, who
“ threw him (Moran) on to the rails.” Moran and Keys
seem to enjoy a monopoly of this opinion. Everybody
else made out that Ruenalf was caught because he could
go no faster, just as the leading horses swept round the
final turn and began to race for home. About this time
Paris stumbled and Nada’s jockey was palpably shifted in
his saddle, but Paris and Nada nevertheless finished fifth
and third respectively. As for Ruenalf, he came in
number eleven, beaten. He was in front and pulling
double at the mile and five furlongs, after which he ceased
pulling and lost ground at every stride.
These monotonous complaints of bumping,
Jostling, fouling, etc., bear out Tub Bulletin’s oft-
repeated statement that the average Australian jockey
rides without head, hands, or system. The finish for a
Derby or Cup suggests a crowd of cockneys walloping
their way across Hampstead Heath on broken kneed nags,
hired at threepence per short gallop. Circular courses,
it goes without saying, are mainly accountable for the
barbarous spectacles which dishearten backers and delight
the “books." No jockey can afford to run wide all the
way round the circus. He must go for the rails most of
the time, and then comes the bookie’s glorious chance of
“ bad luck ” happening to this, that, or the other horse.
And as every big field for a big race includes duffers which
are there merely for the purpose of increasing the number
of bad-luck chances, the crowding on the rails is closer
than it would be in a field of tryers only.
Let punters note how the Argus gives this
jostling game away, without a thought of sarcasm upon
public faith in “form.” On Cup morning the Arous pro-
phet wrote : —“ Provided Ruenalf can stay, his success
would appear to be a question of average luck in the race.
But I have seen many apparent certainties go down, and
staying capacity given in, a little of the bumping which
occurred in the Caulfield Cup and the Derby might
easily prevent his winning."
Two years in succession has Tim Swiveller
been rammed down the throats of punters on Cup
morning. This year he was going to “ make amends for
last year’s disappointment,” in the face of much respeo-
able evidence that he wasn’t good enough for the job. It
was the same with Chicago (also a Caulfield Cup winner)
in 1888 and ’B9. On the first occasion Chicago was a
pretty general fancy and a tremendously strong “tip ” in
certain quarters. He ran like a non-stayer, but next year
all the “ clever ” people Were cocksure that he couldn't
ose.

faulty descriptions of greasy fleece were about a farthing

Bruin, who finished fourth, is the sort of animal
that never wins a hard-run race in first-class company.
It taken to the very front as in the Newmarket flutter,
Toorak mile Handicap, and Caulfield 1J mile Cup, he fails
when collared, whereas he can run like a stayer as long as
he is kept from the lead. In moderate company, with
nothing to test his “ heart," Bruin performs brilliantly.
Patron’s Cup win was a wholesome corrective
to the “ handy weight ” doctrines of writers who think
the “cracks" can always be slopped by a few extra
pounds into the saddle. Patron is a good three-year-old
matured in a good four-year-old, but his improvement
was not at all remarkable. Carnage, Sailor Prince, Patron
and Loyalty (leaving Light Artillery out of the question)
were lengths ahead of all other three-year-olds last
season. Only one older horse, Portsea, could rank with
them at weight-for-age, and with Portsea gone to the
stud, this reasonably well-handicapped quartette deserved
first consideration for the Cup of '94. They got first con-
sideration in The Bulletin, and the analyst clung to the
hope that Carnage was still the daddy of the crowd.
Neither Malvolio, Glenloth, nor Tarcoola (up
to time of writing) has won a sixpence since capturing the
Melbourne Cup. It was time that the big handicap fell
to a real racehorse.
Ruenalf’s boil-over justified a Bulletin sugges-
tion that clever owner Keys, when he scratched his
“ moral ’’ for the Caulfield Cup, was throwing away sub-
stance for shadow. The shorter race was indeed a good
thing for Ruenalf. How Keys, on the night of Nov. 6th,
must have cursed the Ruenalf ticket-holder (C.C.) who
wouldn’t take him into partnership 1 And how the
ticket-holder must have cursed Keys 1 To draw a fortune
in a sweep, and then to have it scratched from your
grasp, must be an awful experience for a pound specu-
lator, who probably does not know the comfort of true
religion.
Power declined to ride Dreamland in the Cup
after the remarks passed upon his Derby handling of that
animal. The Cup result was not exactly balm for
Power’s feelings. Dreamland, with Tiernay up, made a
lot of running with Ruenalf, and was bang in front of the
lighter-weighted Malachite at li miles. In the Derby he
had never made a bold show at all.
It may be many years before Carbine’s Cup time
is beaten. The champion had to get away from the crowd
ere the jostling began, and make the best of his way
home. There were at least seven jockeys chasing him all
the time with orders to prevent the best horse from get-
ting a fair run. But they never arrived at their hoped-for
opportunity. Carbine was too fast for them. This was
one of the rare instances in which virtue defeats the deep-
laid plans of villany. Ask the four or five “prominent
melallicians” who so pertinaciously laid the favorite with-
out decent regard for the appearance of their little books.
“,I got near 'irn once,” said one of the blocking contingent
to his Hebrew patron, when they were discussing the
fiasco in a pub. the night of the race. “ Well, yer ought
to 'ave caught him by the blanky tail and ’eld on,”
observed the child of Israel.
From a Melb. Age article published the Mon-
day after the Derby:—“ Meantime our streets and public
resorts are crowded with the vulpine faces of the pencil-
ling fraternity, and Federation has not progressed further
than the intercolonial combination of these beasts of prey,
who annually rob our too-confiding and simple citizens."
Wh.oh reads like truth, tinged with bitterness of one who
had dropped his money on Dreamland.
Five to one Devon for a “ place ” could be had
on Cup day in the paddock until half an hour before the
race, when he shortened down to 3’s. Even that was
b itter than taking the same price about Ruenalf winning
outright.
Killiecrankie, the slippery youngster, is said to
roar vigorously, but the wind complaint may not grow
upon him to any great extent. He is by Loohiel, whose
sire, Prince Charlie, was the greatest roarer and the
fastest miler that ever befriended the British aristocracy.
Languid swells made a handsome living for a time by
laying the odds on Prince Charlie. His last public per-
formance was a victory over a French horse in a match at
Newmarket. The Frenchmen dropped a mint of money,

Sydney Truth plumes itself on having tipped
the absolute winner and one of the placed horses, Devon,
in Melb. Cup. However, it was Editor Taylor and not
the horse-reporter who was the prophet.

The alleged fact that when O’Sullivan, M.P.,
and his N.S.W. Parliamentary friends were engaged in
table-tipping, the spirits named Patron in advance as
winner of Melb. Cup, doesn’t convince Tub Bulletin.
Let O Sullivan give us his table-tip for the Australian Cup
or any other big, open, near event, and there are plenty
of people who will on race-day get him current book-
makers’ odds up to a hundred or two against it. By the
way, one notices that O’Sullivan's faith in his table only
amounted to £25, whereas his Hebrew friend, Collins,
M. backed the horse for £2OO.

Devon has run second in three Cups, straight-
away. . ~~ '

The S.M. Herald horse-reporter reaches out at
the eloquent and impressive:—“Dawes was hard on
Patron, who responded to every call with the greatest
gallantry. With a face set like death and teeth clenched,
Robson rode for his life, and rode well, but the post was
far too distant, and the big-hearted Patron had reached
the leader’s girths. At the half-distance the whips were
raised and fell on reeking sides ; closer and closer came
Patron at every stride, but Devon still struggled on des-
perately. Looked level in a deathly bitter struggle one
hundred yards from home, they fought out the terrible
battle with the greatest resolution, and then with one
supreme effort, Dawes drove the son of Grand flaneur to
the front, and, never flinching or wavering under the
dreadful strain, Patron came on, wearing down Devon,
and won a brilliant Cup by three-quarters of a length.
* * * *
The Melb. Cup is on the wane. The newspaper
accounts are not at all about that of this year, but salma-
gundi of ten years ago. It is like dragging Madame
Eistori out again. .
« ♦ * *
This is how the Melb. Cnp pots work up. If
the “books” have only laid once against a horse they
don’t want to lay any more. But the public comes
forcing them, and the shortage of the odds is unnatural,
which maddens people, and they fancy it must be a sure
thing. ,
Dawes got .£SOO for riding Patron.
* • * *
How can the difference between handicap and
weight-for-age form be accounted for ?
* * * *
Pony-racing in Sydney: “Three horses were
running, and one was winning easily, when a spectator
tried to lasso its jockey."
• * • •
The collapse of both Ruenalf and Carnage at
the finish of the last two Cups favors the English theory
that a big race cannot be won all the way—that a horse
cannot make his own”running and win too. Patron, like
Lord Clifden, was, to all intents and purposes, out of it at
half-way, but “ his horses came back to him.”

“ Good Mr. Dawes ” was what the little girl
wrote on the sand in “ His Natural Life." The book-
makers write it now.

Never before has the jockey winner of a Melb.
Gup trained another winner.
* * * •
Oamoola’s death through running into a barbed-
wire fence is another illustration of the penny-wire pound-
foolish policy.
* * * *
The only Melb. Cup winners who have sired ]
Cup winners are Tim Whiffler (’67), his descendants being
Briseis, '76, and Darriwell, '79; Grand Flaneur ( 80)
getting Bravo (’B9) and Patron (’94); and Malua (84)
getting Maivolio (’9l). If you like to juggle in figures,
you can demonstrate that a son of Malua ought to win
the Cup in ’97.
• * * *
O’Sullivan’s tip from the spirits of Patron for
Melb. Cup is hardly likely to be added to Saint Stead’s
anthology of spooks, as the application of psychical
research to horse-racing is too demoralising for the pious
editor of The Rehash of Reviews.

The correct “ peas ”: Paris, Caulfield ; Preston,
Moonee Valley ; and Patron, Melb. Cup. The names of
all the top-weights in Melb. Cup began with P—Port Ad-
miral, Paris, Patron, Pilot Boy. Patron was No. 4on
card in Melb. Cup. He is a 4-year-old, and the year was
1894.

They wiped out jockey Moore for getting left at
the post on the Oaks favorite, but unless the V.R.C.
stewards had undoubted proof that Moore wanted to lose
the race their decision was cruelly hard upon a much
suspected man. In the writer’s opinion, Moore thought
it was a false start. True, he could have gone after the
other four horses and caught them before they went three
furlongs, yet he was not to know they would all be con-
tent to crawl as they did. Anyway, there was no reason
in the starter’s permitting’ Moore to stand a chance of
getting left. The filly, Quiver, obviously objected to face
the starting machine, and with such a small field to man-
age it would have been best under the circumstances for
Watson to send them off together in the old way.

Much sympathy is felt for J. O. Inglis in racing
circles on account of his brother’s—the major’s—suicide,
and quite as much for Arthur Hassell, the genial Melb.

The Melb. Cup, 1894, points several morals.
One of them is—Have nothing to do with any heavily-
backed horse whose joint owners’ interests are conflicting
in the event of that favorite getting home.
Not a solitary placed horse in Tattersall’s four
Melb. Cup sweeps went to Victoria.

Melbourne Herald, the Friday before Cup day,
mentioned that as Paris, winner of Caulfield Cup, was
No 1 on the board; Preston, who won Moonee Valley
Cun was No. 8 ; and Tridentate, winner of Maribyrnong
Cud was No.' 9 ; it would be strange if the numeral want-
ing to denote the remaining figure of the present year—
viz 4—were carried by the winner of Melb. Cup. Yet
No!’ 4 (Patron) won, thus completing the figures denot-
ing the present year, 1894.
One of the winners of Tattersall’s Caulfield Cup
sweens was a Vic. railway-pensioner named Richardson,
who drew over £SOOO. The old man intended visiting his
home in Scotland, hut seems destined not to enjoy his
good luck, as at latest he was reported to be dying.

Timoni, Mrs. Everard Browne’s (nee Miss Muffy
Chirnside’s) favorite hunter, signalised his departure
from work for this season by brilliantly winning the
V R C steeple, on Saturday, from the odds-on favorite,
KUlarnev. Mr. J. J. Allen, Timoni’s amateur rider, has
been presented by the fair owner with most, or the whole,
of the stakes, and he also wins a decent wager on his own
account. Timoni now goes to grass until next hunting-
season. , * • •
Second and third horses in Melb. Cup this year
were sired by sons of Musket. Tim Whiffler is the only
horse that has ever sired the first, second and third in the
race. . , * .
“ Victor ” writes 'The honors of the Vic.
Spring campaign most assuredly rest with Devon, whose
record-a win in Toorak Handicap, second in Caulfield
Cun and then a meritorious second in Melb. Cup—stamps
him if not a top sawyer, yet a most reliable performer, a
great thing la these days of in-and-out running.
Patron’s carrying 31b. over w.f.a. as a four-
year-old—an age when a racehorse is at his worst—is sig-
nificant of the mediocre quality of the field.
The only modicum of flattering unction that I
can lav to my “prophetic” soul is that my three selec-
tions—Tridendate, Ronda, and Ruenalf—were all at long
Drices when first mentioned in these columns, and they
finally started fifth, third, and first favorites, and ran—
well, respectably. Only this, and nothing more.
Bruin’s excellent achievement must not be over-
looked, and his Jeweller-like run at the finish fully bears
out the oft-repeated saying of the veteran Mat Dawson :
“If they can only go fast enough for six furlongs they
can all stay.” t
The running of most of the horses, bar Devon
and Bruin, knocks public form into a cocked hat, and
students of “the book” may well weep and wail and close
the volume.
On the Melbourne Stakes form, it was all
Australia to a bunyip on Ruenalf beating Patron,
whilst the Maribyrnong Handicap finish seemed to point
out that wherever Patron ran in the Cup Indentate must
be in front of him.
However, ’tis all over now, and with a word of
warning to look out for Tridentate in Tattersall’s Cup, 1
will bid the Cup of ’94 adieu.
“Blood will tell” has again been forcibly
exemplified, as the bulk of the winnings was secured by
descendants of that rare old sticker. Musket, whose scions
—Grand Flaneur, Trenton, Musk Rose, Nordenfeldt and
Carbine-nil sired winneis during the campaign.
From Queensland, I hear that the Q. Derby
winner, Czarina, an own sister to that honest horse.
Realm (Archie-Empress), is a real clinker, and must be
watched. 'Tis time the land of bananas produced another
first flighter, for since Megaphone nothing has been
brought out that can be classed Al.
Little Triton, an ex-Queenslander, has now
scored four minor wins in succession at Sydney suburban
meetings, and his consistent form should draw attention
to Trident as a sire. This horse, lam convinced, if he
had the mares, would beget racehorses of the very first
flight.
Until Xmas racing comes round cricket will be
the all-absorbing topic.

The Caligraph Writing Machine *
THE CALIGRAPH embodies all the highest
developments of applied mechanics, and its
principle having stood the test of 15 years, its
success towers above the fantastic devices of mush-
room competitors.
“I like Caligraph writing better than that of
any other typewriter because the type comes out
so sharply and clearly.” The prominent Anglican
clergyman, who used these words, had hit upon
the chief characteristic of the Caligraph without
exactly knowing what brought it about. The
result is attributable to the fact that the platen of I
the Caligraph being bevelled the type strike
against a flat surface thus producing a full and
even impression. When you see typewriting with
only the middle of the letters clear you know that
the machine used was not a Caligraph, but one
fitted with the ordinary round platen. When you
read a typewritten letter, with some of the type
leaning to the right and the rest to the left, you
may be sure that your correspondent has a crude
machine, with curved typebars, which naturally
become more crooked, and thus twist their type
out of perpendicular. Then remember that the
Caligraph has straight typebars which, like every-
thing else in the machine, are fitted with adjust-
able bearings.
The Caligraph manifolds 15 carbon copies at
one operation, and used with the Edison Mimeo-
graph reduplicates 1500 copies from one stencil.

The retirement from the scene of action of a
certain punter must prove a big relief to a certain “out-
side ” bookmaker. The pair sat down to hazard one
night, and the bookie rose from the table £600 to the
bad. Punter could not get the money, and “ the Club ”
refused to adjudicate, as Punter was not a member and
the default was not over a wager. Bookie told Punter
to get it as best he could, and Punter took about £100 of
it out in lumps knocked off the bookie’s face at a race-
meeting, and another ±100 or so at another race-meeting.
Punter reckoned to take out the balance later on, but
pressing business has caused an indefinite postponement.
The degenerate Australian horse ! A Cloncurry
(Q0 paper says that J. Dailey and C. Whitaker rode from
Bridgewater Station to Urundangie and back (total dis-
tance, 340 miles) in four hours under four days. They
rode the same horses throughout; and did not travel
after sundown. The horses were just off grass, and had
nothing but the natural herbage during the journey. If
the horses were exceptional, so were the men who had
endurance for such a ride.

A Bulletin correspondent:—The late Martin
Loughlin some years ago sat watching a scientific spar at
the now defunct Melb. Athletic Club. “Damn your
science!” said Marlin—“a few good, hard, straight
punches and they soon forget all that. I’ll lay 50 sovs. I
get a lad with no science at all to beat the best of them.”
A certain member (now a Chief Justice) smiled and took
the wager, and backed the club’s instructor, Billy Wil-
liams. Martin’s nominee was Jimmy Murphy (the Tor-
pedo’s brother). The go will long be remembered. It
was science and hard punching. Result; five rounds,
science a wreck (minus an ear, broken nose, optics black,
a cab, and a week in a private hospital). Hard-puncher
drank his pint, laughed, and swore it was the easiest
money he ever got. Hadn’t a mark, in fact.

Like Larry Foley, but unlike most other boxers,
Corbett not only makes money at the game, but knows
how to keep it. He is already well-off, and the coin is
daily coming in from his theatrical and other ventures.
Sullivan should be worth £100,000 now, but lives from
hand to mouth.

It is usual to describe Corbett as a drawing-
room boxer, but probably he would make mincemeat of
any man alive at the bare-knuckle business. Though
cautious, he has hitherto shown pluck enough when the
time came. Then, he alone of the big men is a good
wrestler, and wrestling, of no use in Queensberry, is all-
important under P.R. Mace was not a champion among
wrestlers, but his knowledge of wrestling made him
formidable in the P.R.jmd helped him to win many fights.
Mick Dooley, himself a skilled boxer of the first
order, says that Peter Jackson, as a scientific boxer, is
unapproached among big men. Slavin was a somewhat
better boxer than Goddard, but the latter's wonderful
endurance at one time more than counterbalanced this.
Dooley gave the Barrier man enough punishment to beat
half-a-dozen, but found him grumbling for more and got
disheartened. Having fought good battles with all three,
Mick is worth hearing on the subject.

length portrait of W. R. Wilson, entitled, “The Master

of grovel. The Master of St. Albans! However, Mr.
Wilson as Wilson is_ not a very remarkable-looking sub-
ject for a two-foot picture, and perhaps it was as well to

dogs of these rival creeds, at St. Hilda slaughter-house, at
dawn on a recent Sunday. Had not about a dozen dis-
guised invitees turned up at intervals and the Catholics
been informed by the joker that the fun was off owing to
“ that_ ruffian So-and-so (a Protestant) giving it away”
(and vice-versa when he had to deal with a Protestant) no
harm would have resulted ; but there were at least three
private human “ scraps ” that morning before cburoh-
time.

F. : I saw the Melb. ’93 Cup from Tattersall’s
stand. Before the race, as the horses passed out of the
adjoining bird-cage gate, the horsey crowd around me
vented their opinions. I listened most respectfully to
one possessed of a lovely flow of language and tobacco-
juice. Track form, public form, and appearance were
A B C to him, and he picturesquely unburdened his lesson
till Tarcoola came—and then for a minute he chewed in
silent surprise. This done, he called on Tarcoola’s aniseed
ancestors and the monstrous mothers of the petrified public
before him to witness his opinion that Tarcoola’s appear-
ance “packed ’’all the knock-kneed knackerson the course.
His wonder rose to fever-heat. His last bean was “ blued ”
on that carnation Carnage—it was a sacrifice to Tarcoola.
He condemned the field and the public and the starter for
ever if Tarcoola could lose. The lowest Tartarus was
good enough for him If Tarcoola didn't win. Much im-
pressed I went down to Grimwood and paid half a sov. for
a ticket in cipher on the subject. I returned to the
stand and saw Tarcoola win. In gratitude I waited for
the Orator and touched his shoulder as he passed. “ You
were a good judge about Tarcoola,” I said humbly.
“Tarcoola!” he responded, “I never mentioned the
(alliterative)abortion’s namein my life.”
At New Angledool (N.S.W.) “Bob the
Swimmer” is a local champion, and every annul is
always asked “ Can you swim ? ” If he says “Yes” he
has to swim Robert the next Saturday. Sometime hack
a “ raw 'uu “ struck New Angledool. He could swim,
and wouldn’t mind trying Bob for a fiver—“or you can
make it a tenner." A good start was effected, and at
half-way the favorite had a big lead. The punters were
thinking what their drinks would be, when the “raw ’un ”
dived down and came up in front of New Angledool’s
champion ; then he dived again and came up in the rear.
This performance was repeated once or twice, Robert not
knowing how to take it. Eventually the new-chum put
on a spurt and won anyhow. Then he took his tenner
and departed. The punters want Ernie Cavill to strike
New Angledool again.

Jenkins, the crack amateur cyclist who made
his reappearance on the racing track in Sydney the other
Saturday, was nearly killed, 12 years ago, in a “big
wheel ” race. As he dashed first past the post a dog ran
in the way of his machine and capsized it. Jenkins fell
forward on his face and hands, breaking his right fore-
arm and left wrist, and almost losing one eye.

Mr. Albert Sharp, the discoverer of the

j The other day one Mahoney, a very new-
■ chum Irishman, was arraigned before Judge Casey
(Vic.) for serious assault, consisting in Mr.
Mahoney’s having fractured the skull of one
Morris with a block of road-metal. The provoca-
tion given by Morris appeared to be that he had
scornfully alluded to Mr. Mahoney as a recent
arrival. Mr. Mahoney pleaded guilty, but added :
“Well, your riverence, Oi don’t know phwat
kind av heads these colonials have—they can’t be
anny thicker than aig-shell. Why, in Oireland
ye can pelt a man from daylight till dark and the
divil a scratch you’d find on him if he was anny
sort av a man at all, at all.” This story was
being retailed to a lot of the Koroit bhoys, one of
whom said ; “ Begorra, thin, Mahoney was right.
Why, I have in my head av a row at eliction-
time, when the O’Meallys got hold av one av the

Ryan killed ?” “ Killed be damned 1 No, he was
pounded fair into the mud, I tell you, and all you
could see was the pint av his ear, and when the
O’Meallys got off him he got out av the mud and
gev himself a shake like a dog and said : ‘Come
on, you divils, I’m ready agin for yez !’ Ye see
the pounding gave him time to draw his breath.” |

Nervousness Cured.
The well-known and popular representative
of the Sydney Bulletin, a gentleman whose
testimony carries special weight, writes thus :
To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir, -I think it my duty to inform you
that a course of your Alfaline Vitality Pills
acted very beneficially on my nervous system,
and, in consequence, I have recommended them
to many friends, who have all been cured by
their use. —Yours, R. A. LUCKHAM.

Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform
you that a course of your Alfaline Pills com-
pletely cured me of a severe case of biliousness,
wind and nervousness. I may also mention
that several of my friends to whom I have
recommended your remedies have derived great
benefit from them; therefore, I consider you

heartily wish you.—Yours gratefully,

Sir, —I hereby beg to certify that having

cured, and I shall be most happy to recom-

was. Thanking you for your courtesy and

Buoo “Skipped.”
“ Hands Across the Sea,” which now per-
vades Sydney Royal, would be a robust melo-
drama with no specially obnoxious features, were
it not quite so full of remarks about the British
Flag. As it is, the flag grows very heavy towards
the end, and it is further aggravated by the im-
pressive manner in which J. P. West tells his
minions to hoist it on important occasions. Even
when it isn’t actually visible it infests the premises
in the spirit, and an aroma of British Flag is
noticeable all through the piece. Also, there are
many ringing allusions to the “ laws of In-n-n-ng-
land.” The author of the drama was evidently
weak on points of law, by the way, and on a few
other things as well. When a cold and cynical
French convict, after being paraded in chains on
Circular Quay, Sydney, to induce him to tell the
truth, still refuses to exculpate the bright young
English hero, he is publicly shaken and bumped
by an Australian detective in order to awaken his
sense of rectitude. This may be a stage custom,
but the real detective bumps his prisoner pri-
vately. Moreover, English law doesn’t allow any
man to be shaken in order to extract evidence.
Later on, however, a comic person, who is
unknown to the policeman, points out a by-
stander in a brown suit as the man who
really did the deed, and thereupon the police-
man releases the hero, despite the fact that
he is sentenced to penal servitude for life,
and the hero remarks enthusiastically, while
embracing Miss Yirgie Vivienne, that all his
troubles are now over. Having been honorably
acquitted by the policeman on Circular Quay, in
full view of Hill, Clark and Co.’s wool store and
close to where the North Shore boat starts from,
he undergoes no further disturbance. An attempt
has been made to gratify Australian tastes by
causing certain hard-up English characters to
come to this country, and make a large fortune
apiece, and return to England with the proceeds;
it being probably imagined that the Australian
never feels so thoroughly good all over as when he
sees such individuals as these taking immense
sums of money out of the countrp, and going
“’Ome” to spend the evening of their days in
hoisting the British flag. The English characters
in “ Hands Across the Sea ” are mostly noble, and
show up splendidly against a dark back-ground of
French scoundrel. Miss Virginia Vivienne makes
a pretty heroine, particularly excellent in sundry
tragic passages where she struggles against a great
accumulation of French counts and other vil-
lains. Messrs. Alfred Woods, Geo. Lash Gordon
and Leonard are three capable actors, and save
the drama on many occasions from looking so
foolish as nature intended it to do, and a number
of minor characters, and some of the scenery, back
them up manfully. A perfectly square Pacific
Ocean, Mr. J. P, West, the British Flag, and the
policeman who acquits the convict on Circular
Quay are, however, expressly excluded from this
commendation, and so is a certain raw-meat verse
about the old English “ blood,” which the hero
recites on Circular Quay, alongside the Mosman’s
Bay ferry wharf. This verse is a truly dreadful
little bathos, and no man with a sense of the
ridiculous would recite it anywhere within 40
miles of a human habitation.
** * *
That soulful little curtain-raiser, “ To Call
Her Mine.” which had altogether too much of the
wash of the old grey sea in it, has been taken out
of the Lyceum programme, and “ True as Truth ”
occupies its place. The change is decidedly for
the better, for the other piece, when hitched on to
the “New Boy,” suggested a goblin at a picnic,
or something of the sort. Concerning the principal
comedy, The Bulletin still adheres to its
conviction that the boy himself is somewhat
lacking in humor, and that but for Felix
Roach, and possibly Bullock, senr., there would
be comparatively little comedy in it. Miss
Edith Housley, whose mission it is to be-
come engaged to all the big boys in the school,
and to make large, expressive eyes at the French
master, is partly a replica of Dr, Grimston’s
daughter in “ Vice Versa,” and partly a duplicate
of Minnie Palmer, that fluffy charmer of old, in
“My Sweetheart.” Her fluffy appearance sug-
gests Minnie Palmer strongly, and she makes the
best, in a quaint and rather pretty fashion which
is mostly her own, of a somewhat weak part. The
part, in fact, consists mainly of a good deal of
precocious flirtation and a set of dazzling teeth,
and Miss Edith is good in both characters. Her
portrait appears in this issue.
** * *
“Siberia,” after an undeservedly brief
career at Her Majesty’s (Sydney), gives place, on
Saturday, to the “Two Orphans.” In the hands
of a strong company this drama almost always
pans out well; in the hands of a weak one it has
great possibilities in the way of bathos. It ap-
peared at its best some years ago, when Misses
Lucia Harwood and Maggie Knight were the
orphans, and whether it will ever again reach that
standard is open to question.
** * *
“Mdlle. Mbouche,” which disclaims all
pretension to opera, and admits indirectly that it
is a mere wicked French novelty with lots of
spice in it, had a warm reception at Melb.
Princess’ on Saturday. In fact, the fame of
“Nitouche,” and the Living Pictures to follow,
operating upon the circumstance that a racing
public needed a suitable place of refuge from its
thoughts, caused the “house ” to smash the record
at ordinary prices. People who couldn’t buy
standing room simply hung on to space, and
pounded the air with their feet when they wanted
encores. “Nitouche” now is the same three-act
riot that Sydney and The Bulletin approved of
a short while ago. Nellie Stewart and Lauri are
the sole supports of a plot which knows no com-
punction, and sticks at nothing. The artists
aforesaid begin and end in a convent school,
but the things they do outside of the school
would paralyse Miss May Pollard, if she only
knew. Miss P. is the Lady Superior, and her
demeanor in nun’s costume contributes a touch of
infinite calm to the ensemble. Wallace Brownlow
plays and sings his small part in the best of
manners; also, the four naughty dancers form a
beautifully straight line with their eight legs—
touching which, it may be remarked that there is
nothing exceptional about the posture of these
dear girls. Every member of a corps de ballet
must acquire the art of sitting down at full length,
so to speak, wherefore the charge of impropriety
levelled against dancers who happen to perform
this every-day movement in public is quite
absurd, and the occasional Johnnie who calls it
“horrible” is libelling the first rudiment of a
charming profession.
• * •
One of Nellie Stewart’s “Nitouche” cos-
tumes—a demi-semi toilette let in with large
glimpses of pink fleshing—paves the way for the
tableaux-vivants. Melbourne’s first experience of
the living pictures was very pleasing. The pro-
truding eyes of the male audience gleamed with a
strange light, and Mrs. Grundy, seeking revela-
tions through her lorgnette, felt bound to perceive
the purity of Art. A delicate compliment paid to
Venus and other statue pictures was the common
suspicion that they didn’t live at all. The still-
ness of sweet Psyche, gazing upon her reflection
in a painted stream, provoked a gurgle of admira-
tion. And the back-view lady, nestling against
the stuffed dog before she started resuming her
garments—nobody could believe her guilty of pul-
ling a string to make the animal’s tail wag, yet
she must have moved a muscle somewhere. The
saint who hopes to detect giddiness in these tab-
leaux must bore a gimlet-hole through the roof
and glue his eye to the aperture. Seen from the
stalls or circles they are deliciously decent, sug-
gesting nothing worse than an idea that one would
like to change places with the dawg aforesaid.
** * *
“ Jack Sheppard ” goes with an uncertain
amount of dash at the Royal. There was at least
one night last week when the old burlesque might
have travelled with more determination, but, as a
rule, the company make things lively. Maggie
Moore has introduced some new songs, and Blue-
skin improves as he goes along. Other people are
beginning to get a good polish on their reminis-
cences of extravaganza, Dick Stewart being a
particular case in point. Mr. Stewart’s dancing,
as Kneebone, is humorous as well as nimble, and
his legs express real pleasure at their respite from
the weary round of melodrama. A proof that
“Little Jack Sheppard” is suitably cast lies in
the management’s promise to keep it up for
another week or two, unless business drops with
unusual suddenness.
** * *
John Gourlay and his perennial ‘‘ Skipped ”
are back again at the Bijou. “Skipped” has a
habit of reappearing at one theatre or other when
least expected, and its company, apart from
Gourlay, is subject to violent changes. This time
Gourlay is assisted by some sound comedians and
a capital soubrette in Miss Isabel Stuart. The
show, moreover, has a strong musical attraction.
Miss Ulster, whose bonnie presence atones for
her amateurish acting, trills “Sing, Sweet Bird,”
and peals forth a waltz bravura in beautiful styleli
Meantime the little Oxford Theatre, under Cogill\
management, is still doing a great variety busi-
ness ; and Abell and Klaer’s circus flourishes like
the evergreen “ wheeze” of the clown who never
dieth.
** * *
On Wednesday and three following days
of the current week Mrs. Annie Besant delivers
farewell orations at Melb. Athenmum Hall. That
wonderful woman intends to deal with Theosophy
pure and simple on these last nights, and the
unbelievers will probably roll up to hear her
explain the difference between real spirits and the
spurious articles which collapse when the gas is

Yice-regal Robinson’s opera, “ Preda-
toros,” was elegantly produced at Melb. Princess’
on Monday afternoon. These remarks are in-
spired by the first act only, for The Bulletin’s
rep, couldn’t wait to see the second. Remarks
upon both acts would doubtless have been stronger
—much, much stronger. The pervading charac-
teristic of Messrs. Robinson and Hart’s opera
is its want of originality. Unfortunately,
it is not a base imitation of any other
work. There is a thin story which ger-
minated in “The Mountebanks,” and drew a
little sustenance from “Pirates of Penzance.”
The story is told in thin dialogue and thin verses
set to thin music. The lyrics, though snapless,
pass muster, but the dialogue bristles with proofs
that Mr. Hart cannot discriminate between ab-
surdity humorous and absurdity stupid. No
stage business worth mentioning is to be seen.
At Poverty Point.
Dear Bulletin,— The Australian Actors’ Benevolent
Institutions seeming to be in such a bad way, 1 would
suggest that a plan which is in vogue here should be
adopted by your managers. I sent my card in to the
Garden Theatre and applied for a box, which I received
per return post. When I presented my ticket (I had six
people with me) we had to pay 10 cents (5d.) each. Natur-
ally, I asked what this was for, and was told it was a tax
upon deadheads and went to the Actors’ Benevolent
Fund. No exception whatever is made. Everyone who
has the privilege of entree has to pay this tax. I thought
it a splendid thing, and the meanest man in the world
could hardly refuse to pay sd. when he is getting, per-
haps, a 10s. seat for nothing. If this were done through-
out Australasia, no poor, old, or unfortunate actor or
actress need want the necessaries of life.—Yours, G. H.
Snazbllb, New York, 25th Sept., '9l. [Tub Bulletin
hopes to see this plan adopted.]
The just-announced marriage of a certain Anglo-Aus-
tralian official potentate with a veteran actress was a
mere formality to legalise a domestic arrangement of
very long standing.
R. S. Smythe has announced his intention of retiring
from management at 60, but he expects to rake in a few
more shekels before then.
A Melb. paper: “We can’t understand why George
Rig n old plays Marc Antony in ‘Julius C»sar,’ when both
Brutus and Cassius are better ‘acting’ characters."
“ Yon Cassius has a lean and hungry look," would fit
Rignold like a glove.
At a concert given in a Hobart (Congregational) church,
“secular” items were rendered, applause liberally
awarded with hands and feet, encores demanded and
given, and huge bouquets handed up to performers.
Edith Moore, of Hiscock’s Federal minstrels, now play-
ing in Sydney, is a daughter of the Fijian Surveyor-
General.
Titheradge has seven daughters. Mrs. Titheradge has
not appeared in Melb. for many years, since she took
Robinson Crusoe, in the Opera House pantomime.
That charming actress, Maggie Knight, was lately mar-
ried to Mr. Harry Anderson, a Sydney commercial man
who hails from Maoriland, and who years ago had the
reputation of being the stoutest oarsman in the Auckland
province.
On Wednesday week the pictures to be represented at
the Princess’ tableaux vivants were exhibited in a Col I ins-
street window, among them being the “ Will o’ the Wisp”
nude. The latter, however, only remained in evidence
about two hours, for at one o’clock its place was taken by
“The Doctor.” The man with the long upper-lip still
bosses Melbourne.
The expansive Maggie Moore has long been a confirmed
advocate of dress reform. At rehearsals she always dis-
cards the cumbrous skirt for the free-and-easy breeches.
She has not, however, advanced far enough to show the
outline of her ample limbs on the Block yet. The female
breeches brigade might petition Maggie to act as leader
of the forward movement.
LITTLE JACK SHEPPARD.
They greeted Maggie with a roar.
Their warm affection to confess,
And yet they don’t want Maggie more—
In fact, they want her rather less.
Melbourne Leader asks: “ Who is Miss RhodaHalkett,
who is being announced in England as an Australian
actress of striking beauty and talent? She is described
as an extremely beautiful woman, tall and fair, with big
grey eyes, has a rich, full voice, and possesses most
attractive manners.” Tim Bulletin isn’t dead certain
that Ehoda Halkett (Mrs. Parker) is Australian by birth,
and it isn’t sure that she is especially tall, and it wouldn’t
swear that her talent is very “striking.” But it backs
her straight out as the prettiest woman with the brightest
and most poetic eyes who has been on the Australian
stage for some years past, and the paper that professes
not even to have seen this dazzling vision is a hypocritical
affair which is mainly trying to propitiate its mother-in-
law.
Henry Herman, playright and story-writer, and joint-
author of “The Silver King,” who died the other day,
was an all-round man. Originally educated for the
German army, he became an M.D. of Paris and then prac-
tised medicine and edited a newspaper in South America.
He was a brave and distinguished Confederate colonel in
the American War of Secession. Then he drifted to
England and became a successful playwright. “ Silver
King” gave him £30,000, and “Olaudian” even more.
He entertained his friends as Lucullus would have enter-
tained them. Remonstrances on his extravagance had no
effect—his money poured forth like water until a lady un-
wittingly brought him to reason. He was to give a special
dinner in Mrs. Conover’s honor, and went himself toCovent
Garden and bought early peas at two guineas a quart.
After Mrs._ 0. had eaten, she turned to Herman and
thanked him for so great a treat. “Those peas, Mr.
Herman,” she said, “ are the best canned peas I ever ate
in my life.” Which so disgusted him that he never gave
another dinner. That one chance remark taught him
more than all his bitter experiences of sleeping in the
park, when first he reached London at the close of the
war without a penny in his pocket and wandered round
in search of a meal.
Dear Bulletin, —A late cable re the action of the
London County Council trying to close the pro-
menade bars of the “ Empire,” is possibly Greek to
hundreds of your readers. Hereunder lies the interpreta-
tion : The Empire promenade is the one public resort (at
about 10 p.m.) of the cr£rae de la crfime of the London
demi-monde. The upholstering of the place is on the
most superb scale, the promenade is furnished with
innumerable elegant lounges placed at different angles,
and mirrors so arranged that the size of the place appears
gigantic. A glass partition separates the bars from the
promenade, the entrance to which is through two glass
doors in the centre. If a visitor places himself opposite
these doors with his back to the stage and leans against
the plush-covered division which separates the gallery
from the promenade he will see a vision which cannot be
excelled in the world. He will quite forget that he is
taming his back on perhaps the best variety-show on
earth, and if he is an average Australian he will not turn
round again. He will see about 40 of the most beautiful
and well-bred-looking women that he has ever seen, some
sitting by themselves two or three on a lounge, others
promenading, here and there one or two talking in a sub-
dued tone to gentlemen, but all lady-like, and, of course,
dressed in the height of fashion. The nymphs visiting
this part of the premises are all known to the manage-
ment, and belong to a stratum never seen on the streets.
Five shillings is charged for admission to the promenade.
You will not be astonished to learn that the Empire Co.,
Limited, pays good divs., and is the property of a very
wealthy and aristocratic proprietary. A feature of the
place is the number of Australians you see there—with
their backs turned to the performance.—J.R.B.
Snazelle was to start his “rational Sunday evenings”
at the Garden Theatre, Madison-sq., N.Y., early in Oct.
Eleonora Duse, the Italian actress, threatens a visit to
Australia. From all The Bulletin hears, Duse is an
acquired taste, and by no means a howling financial
success in Europe.
Well-known and capable pros, (in some cases ex-stars)
are doing Melb. suburbs in standard dramas at no fixed
prices of admission, a silver coin only being expected.
Poor pros, in Melbourne, some of whom at one time
received their £8 to £lO weekly, jump at a chance of 6s.
a night, 7s. 6d. a performance being considered atop rate.
I thought Mrs. Langtry was a bad actress (says The
Bulletin’s London correspondent), but, after seeing
Anna Ruppert, the lovely complexionist, in ‘ Odette,’ 1
am inclined to think that the lovely Lily is a perfect
Bernhardt. Mrs. Ruppert apparently has a lot of money,
made out of face-washes at a guinea a bottle, for the
floral and other decorations of the Princess's at the pre-
miere of ‘Odette’ were most sumptuous. In addition
to owning the lease of the theatre, Anna is the proprietor
of a most inoffensive-looking husband, who seems devoted
to her. On the morning of the day * Odette ’ was pro-
duced Anna fancied she detected a smell of oats, so,
accompanied by her submissive spouse, who was laden
with bottles of scent, she went round the house spraying
perfume. Herbert Flemming, by the way, had a part in
‘ Odette.’ Salaries for two weeks were paid in advance.
One day last week Judge Windeyer made absolute 12
divorce-decrees nisi. The petitioners were mostly women.
An idea for them, from the recent handbill of a Yankee
dime-museum: “Twelve lonely, sorrowing, sympathetic,
grief-stricken ex-wives; twelve heartbroken, abused, mis-
led, unhappy divorcees. An object-lesson in establish-
ment of the fact that marriage is a lottery. Each one had
at her feet the man of all the world she loved best. Now
she will have at her feet a framed copy of the Divorce
decree which tells the story of a good man gone wrong.
They will be on view, beginning next Saturday, attired in
widows’ weeds. Their decrees are all genuine, each bear-
ing the seal of the Court and the signature of the Judge
granting it. 250 dollars in gold to the prettiest, the most
modest-looking, 4to. To be decided by the popular vote
of the visitors.”
C. N. Steen, the sleight-of-hand performer, says that
Anna Eva Fay, the medium on whose performances the
celebrated Crookes, the radiometer man, based much of
his spiritualassic reasoning, confessed to him when subse-
quently in his employ that she cheated the professor just
as easily as she could cheat anybody else. The Bulletin,
which used to see a good deal of the pallid, cigarette-
chewing professor, long ago concluded that he could be
easily humbugged by anything pretty in skirts.
Despite alleged bad times, the present theatrical season
is one of the most prosperous on record (says The Bulle-
tin's London correspondent). Money is being turned
away at Daly’s (“A Gaiety Girl”), the Prince of
Wales (“Claude Duval”), Adelphi(“The Fatal Card”), and
Comedy (“The New Woman”); whilst full houses are the
order of the night at the Globe (“ Charley’s Aunt”), Vaude-
ville(“The New Boy”), Lyric(“ Little Christopher Colum-
bus”), Terry’s (“The Foundling,” which gladdens the
heart of Plain Bill Holloway), and Toole’s (“ A Trip to
Chinatown"). At the Lyric, a few nights ago, Sedger told
me they had over £2OO in the house. All the while the
halls are doing enormous business.
The Sapio-Urso Co. had very ordinary success in Ade-
laide—mainly because they had no Smythe to do the
prelim, booming. At one or two concerts the hall was
not half filled.
The Brough-Boucioault partnership will, The Bulletin
hears, probably be dissolved on the latter’s return from
England. Boucicault will then run the Co., and Austra-
lia will lose Mr. and Mrs. Brough lor ever if they get a
footing in London.
The announcement of “living models ” at Melb. Bijou
sent a tingle down the spine of every Johnnie in Mel-
bourne, who fondly hoped that the beauteous Leslie
Norman, in tights, would be part, if not the whole, of the
show. The fair Leslie, who should be a model out of
skirts, was only a model in them. Some of the panto
people, though, are missing a chance.
Theodora, a circus rider, became Roman Empress, wife
of Justinian. May not Melba—but, no matter.
A peculiarity of Bernhardt is that distance does not
lend enchantment to the view. The closer one is the
better she looks.
A Prahran (Melb.) tradesman shows in his window a
playbill of the very first night of Melb. Royal, with the
“ School for Scandal " and “ Maid of All Work.” Charley
Bm ford was the Joseph Surface, Charley Walsh, now a
Melb. boniface, the Sir Oliver. Any others of the cast
larding the lean earth, after 40 years? H. N. Warner,
the Charles Surface, father of W. B. Warner, was last
heard of in America.
A seedy mummer arrived recently in a W.A. town and
asked a local pastor to lend him a good coat in which to
make his first appearance. The astounded preacher
refused. Since then about 14 abusive letters have
appeared in the papers concerning his unchristian con-
duct, and the mummer has lived mainly upon the public
sympathy which he has aroused. Where the sympathy
comes in isn’t very clear. The man who lends his coat to
a seedy tragedian would probably have to preach next
Sunday in his shirt sleeves.
Tay Pay O’Connor speaks of Plain Biilolloway as a man
of the type that does credit to theatrical management.
Camilla Urso is at present “ resting " at Adelaide, and
meditates another Australian tour “on her own." Mme.
De Vere Sapio has gens ’ome to get £6O a week in London.
Allred Plumpton, quondam musical critic ol Melb. Am
and composer of the music lor the original living pictures’
has completed the score of an operetta called “Huan
Mee,” the Australian rights of which “ the Firm •' have
secured. Plumpton has also a new opera ready, called
His Excellency,” the music of which he wrote in Melb
to a libretto by Fergus Hansom-Cab Hume.
Qus Bruno, now appearing at Melb. Oxford, is a specu-
lation of Rickards’, and is only on loan to the Coghills.
Bruno is also well-known in America as an operatic
comedian, and he intends, when his present agreement
runs out, to open “on his own” in a season of musical
comedy with some of his American successes.
Loie Fuller, the Yankee danseuse, introduces, as the
latest terpsichorean novelty, the “Mirage” dance, which
is merely the same old high-kick executed beneath a
mirror so that the tantalising spectacle of Loie apparently
standing on her head is reflected upon the surface with
startling accuracy. The Bulletin, however, surmises
“ ®" a PP ie dom would prefer the real reversal of form
thstCMn® Swain used to exhibit to a mere shadow of a
shade, so to speak, where the lady’s skirts maintain their
normal position.
Sarah Bernhardt, having at last induced Coquelin to
Join her 00., will appear as Prince Hal to his Falstaff in an
adaptation ol “Henry IV.” She has left her return to
boy s costume rather late in life, but probably the plump
Sarah of to-day will be a greater success in tights than the
attenuated Sarah of a decade ago would have been.
Yankee criticism of Patti Her technique is bad.
besides being too small. When a bran-new technique can
be n a d for three dollars, and a good second-hand one, to
hold over two quarts, for one dollar seventy-five cents
there is no excuse for this. There is, too, a marked
deficiency in breadth and depth and thickness in the
upper register, which does not admit the air freely in con-
sequence ; and a far-off nearness, asort of inanimate after-
taste, so to speak, in the diminuendo of her flats—parti-
cularly her French flat. Her singular mannerism ol
holding her chin lop-sided during her 00-ups is in bad
,0 ” n 5 an “ the first thing she knows, one of her sharps
will slip out sideways and cut her throat. She should
open one side of her mouth at a time, so as to save the
wear and tear of her teeth.”
‘‘This actress has become part-owner of a peerage."
London critic .
, Ye L t “ ore French. “ Pas Du Tambourines "on a Melb.
playbill.
Abell, of Abell and Klaer, mentions that Omar Kingsley
Zoyara ** * week ’ while doing the dashing Ella
"Steele Grey ” has been engaged by Coppin to do the
songs and topical work for the “ Aladdin" panto, at
Melb. Royal.
Madame Novarra (Mary Anderson) says she is happier
as a wife than she was as an actress. But all wives are
actresses.
Arthur Roberts, says The Bulletin’s correspondent,
has taken London by storm again with his “Claude
Duval. It is a farrago of absurdities, being, in fact,
Arthur and little more, except some pretty lyrics by
Bowyer. Of plot there is none, but Roberts, in a bewilder-
ing number of changes, keeps the ball rolling and the
audience in constant laughter. He is now a smart bar-
maid, with all her airs and graces; then a fashionable
lady palmist telling fortunes, and showing to the life the
vulgar ways of the parvenue ; anon he is a sharp up to all
the tricks of the ; now he is successfully playing
the confidence-trick upon a simple-minded old gentle-
man , now showing a “bit of life” to a young softy.
There is only one Arthur Roberts, and he was born, like
Penley, to make sedate people laugh. Yesterday people
were waiting in ths street at half-past 5 for the doors to
open at 7.
Dora Taylor, the “Little D’Argo ” of Coppin’s last
panto., though under ten years, saved a younger child’s
ife the other day at Healesville, Vic., by running l into a
creek and dragging the drowning playmate to land.
Better than losing diamonds.
The Music Hall, a London paper, awards a bottle of
strong drink as a prize to the sender of the following
funny story." A burnt cork comedian was lecturing
upon the characteristics ol “the bullock,” represented
by a red herring which he held in his paw. He asked
anyone in the audience to give him a watch and chain,
that he might tell the herring the time. A silver watch
and chain were handed up, whereupon the humorous
creature told the herring the time and walked away with
the goods. “He has got it (the watch and chain) and is
wearing »f. ' There’s the entire story. Think ol being
able to get a bottle of anything lor a narrative like that 1
Good old Ber-rewtus again 1 Cathcart ought to write
ms autobiography. Turning up London Athbnjeum, we
find him mentioned in 1850 as a promising actor. What
a beautiful humility about him I One recalls his taking
the Prison Warder, when Rignold produced “Youth."
Owing to the demand lor seats at London Adelphi to
® ee Haddon Chambers and Stephenson’s “ The Fatal
Card, ’ the pit price was increased to 2s. fid.
An interesting event is expected in the Beerbohm-Tree
family—after an interval of seven years—which will neces-
sitate the temporary withdrawal of Mrs. T. from the
Hayraarket stage. This will make room for Mrs. Patrick
Campbell, and remove all cause of professional jealousy
between the two ladies.
In a “brother ” combination of acrobats, now in Melb.,
one is colored and two are plain white.
“Teddy" Lonnen (his health is failing) has rushed off
to America—“the very worst place he could go to for
rest, ’ remarks the Referee— and his brother Walter
takes hia part in “Little Christopher Columbus ** pvo .
tctn,. The news that there is another Lonnen, a counter-
part of the steam-engine Lonnen, seems even sadder than
the Czar s decease.
Richard Stewart, sen., will stage-manage Melb. Royal
panto.
Sophie Harris, the vivacious and shapely burlesque
artiste, now acting the name part in “Aladdin, Jun.," at
Chicago, appears to have traded off some wondrous yarns
on a Yankee interviewer. Sophie is a fine girl and the
memory of her legs will live in Australia when Parkes is a
vanished dream ; also, she once distinguished herself by
capturing a burglar single-handed in an Adelaide hotel.
But—she didn’t create all the contralto parts of Gilbert
and Sullivan’s operas in the Australasian capitals.
Melb. Lyric Club is palpably weakened in principals
since its first public performance, and sadly misses Ethel
Haydon since she turned professional and w-ent to
London. The Lyric, by the way, appears to have tired
very soon of its recently-announced intention of eschewing
opera in favor of sacred music.
If Mrs. Mellon’s words are true,
And she so shrunken grows,
When bringing spirits to the view,
That stockings leave her toes ;
If shapely ankles fade away
To merely skin and bone,
If calves to astral bodies pay
A Shylook kind ol loan:
Then let us pray that Violet V.,
A slave to tedium,
May never, never, seek to be
A ghostly medium.
For, what would Sydney’s feelings be I
How loud the wail would rise I
If we were never more to see
Those shapely legs of Vi.’s.
But, oh 1 the Joy of any spook
Become a form pro. tem.,
He’d feel a marquis or a dook,
Materialised in them.
Still, we prefer her on the stage
In shoes and stockings neat,
Than, victim to the latest rage,
Performing in a sheet.
It is recorded that during the Reign of
Terror the very children in the street were in the
habit of holding mock executions with mimic
guillotines. An enterprising Melb. toy-vendor
has recollected this fact and profited by it to the
extent of introducing a new and gruesome toy.
It takes the form of a small wooden gallows for
the hanging of dolls.

A Porlorn Hope.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ I’ll do it, if I come off right.”
He kissed her roughly as he spoke ;
She held his shrinking fingers tight—
Poor victim of a “sporting bloke !”
Unmoved by sorrow for her plight.
He’ll marry if he “ comes off right.’’
She loved not wisely, but too well;
Who slowly fall repent in haste.
She took him for an honest “swell,”
And, dazzled by a “ bit of paste,”
Thought gaily of the wedding-bell—
A golden ring, and all were well.
Quite possibly he’d keep his word ;
He’s not a villain out-and-out,
He thought it looked “ the deadest bird ”
The Cup was over, bar the shout.
And, if he won, O thought absurd !
The surly dog might keep his word.
The days speed by, a cruel time !
Her fate depending on a race !
For passion is a spinster’s crime,
Maternity her black disgrace,
Says Mrs. Grundy’s creed sublime—
The “ creature ” has a cruel time.
Flash touts who sniff the early morn.
Write “Fizgig pulled up rather lame.”
An infant shortly to be born
Will bring one erring parent shame.
A girl’s last “ chance ” they view with scorn,
Those touts who tout the rosy dawn.
They’ll “bet their life that Fizgig goes,"
“ His leg can never bear the strain.”
Amid the wails of backers’ woes
We shall not hear one moan of pain.
Her bloke will curse, but Heaven knows
What Nell will do when Fizgig goes !

Traas. Ward has got a Bill through the
M.L. House of Representatives providing that,
in future, all local rates shall be levied on unim-
proved land-values only. Hitherto, municipal
rates have been levied on lands and buildings in-
discriminately, but if the latter are released
from liability, and taxation is levied on lands
alone, there will be a cold time for owners who
hold unimproved city property for a rise. When
the propiietor of a blank allotment has to pay as
much taxation as the man alongside who has
erected a five-storey stone building on his ground,
holding city lands for speculative purposes will
become eminently unprofitable. Also, the relief
to the owner of the big building will be so great
that it will serve as an inducement to erect fine
structures in place of weatherboard hovels, seeing
that the hovel will yield much less rent and yet
the tax will be the same. Probably, however, the
new idea will be decently interred in the Upper
House as usual.
Arthur Gallon, the Dibbs-appointed new
chum N.S.W. official historian, assures United
Service Institution that Churchill, first Duke of
Marlborough, was generous and of pure conver-
sation. Yet did Macaulay write :
Churchill was thrifty in his very vices, and levied ample
contributions on ladies enriched by the spoils of more
liberal lovers. On one occasion he was caught with the
Duchess of Cleveland, by the King, and was forced to
leap out of the window. She rewarded this hazardous
feat of gallantry with a present of £5OOO. With this sum
Hie prudent young hero instantly bought an annuity.
He loved lucre more than wine or women. At twenty he
made money of his beauty and his vigor ; at sixty lie
made money of his genius and his glory. He pocketed
pay in the names of men who had long been dead, &c., &c.
It is too late now to undeceive poor Mac.; but
Gallon should be the right man to embellish Aus-
tral’s Annals by whitewashing the progenitors of
Potts Point. The “best blood” and “the old
families ” of the senior province can safely trust
to the discretion of the gentleman who has the
bravery to praise for his morality, his generosity,
his loyalty and his high sense of honor, the soldier
who gained his first steps in promotion by
prostituting bis sister to the then Duke of York,
the Torn Jones of the Lady Bellastons of his time,
the skin-flint who had no God but money, and the
double-dyed traitor who played with Stuart and
Hanoverian until he had succeeded in getting the
highest price for his sword.

FOUNTAINS IN PLAY.
Who doesn’t enjoy looking at a fountain in play ?
The bright water leaps into the air as though it
were a living, conscious thing. Then at the
summit of its arch it is shattered into spray by
the wind, or wafted to and fro like the skirts of a
dancing girl. And all the while the roar of its
rush and the tinkling melody of its fall fill the air.
This is water having a good time —water in high
spirits. What makes it jump, sing, and laugh in
that fashion? Wait a bit. If you please, we
will have the explanation later on. Perhaps you
know already ; perhaps not. It isn’t so easy to
know things from the bottom.
Under date of March 16th, 1892, a lady writes
that for twenty years she always felt low-spirited.
Now, what is meant by “ spirits ” in this sense is
a condition of the mind in respect of our being
cheerful, happy, enjoying our surroundings, taking
delight in all sorts of minor matters, and, in a word,
making the most of life ourselves and helping
others to make the most of it. Well then, it is
both a glorious and a profitable thing to be always
in good spirits ; I wish I could be myself.
But I can’t; anyhow, I’m not. Neither is
anybody. Yet why not ? What makes our hearts
sink down like a plummet, and then rise like a
cork ?
Before we answer let us read the rest of the
letter. The writer says; “For twenty years I
have suffered from liver complaint and indigestion.
I was constantly tired, weak, and languid. My
skin was a sallow colour, and I had great pain at
the back and shoulders.
“My appetite was poor, I had a bad taste in the
mouth, and much pain and weight at the chest
after eating. I was also frequently sick, throwing
up a sour, frothy fluid. I took different kinds of
medicine, but none of them gave me relief, and I
got weaker and weaker.
“In March, 1884, I became so bad that I called
a doctor, who attended me off and on for twelve
months. He gave me medicines, but I grew no
better, as nothing he prescribed seemed to reach
my complaint. About this time I heard of Mother
Seigel’s Syrup, and commenced taking it. In less
than a month all my pain and distress ceased, and
1 have since been in good health. I keep a bottle
of the Syrup in the house as a family medicine,
and by taking an occasional dose have needed no
doctor.
“I may mention that my aunt, who lives at
West Wycombe, Bucks, was afflicted with indiges-
tion and dyspepsia. She states that in her opinion
Mother Seigel’s Syrup has been the means of
saving her life. You are at liberty to use this
statement as you may see fit. Yours truly,
(Signed) Mrs. Harriett Cutler, Burton House,
33 Kenmure Road, Hackney, London.”
No philosopher has yet been able to say what
is the exact relation of the mind to the body.
This much, however, experience constantly assures
us of; that it is very intimate, and that the
condition of the mental faculties depends upon
that of the body. As birds sing when the sun
shines, and are dumb in the dark, so the spirits
and mental powers rise and express themselves
when we are in health, and are dull and torpid
when the body is under the weight of pain and
disease. And to know that is to know all we
require to act upon.
Everything, money, influence, and every form
of success depends so largely upon health that by
universal consent we don’t expect good service
from those who are ill.
And illness, nine times in ten, means precisely
what Mrs. Cutler suffered for such a long and
weary period—indigestion and dyspepsia—the
ailment cured (when the doctors are done with
their fruitless experiments) by Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup.
The fountains play only when the water is
forced powerfully through their pipes by gravity
or by machinery. So the spirits are free and
elastic only when the organs within us act without
hindrance or obstruction.

• “ If a man, when ho is in work, is without
the necessaries of life, what can he do when he is
out of work? His only course is to die of hunger.
In that case, a few words of pity will be uttered
over his corse. Let others be content with such a
fate. I could not be. I might have begged.
Deggary is cowardly and degrading. It is even
punished by law, which regards it as a crime. I
preferred to turn contrabandist, coiner of counter-
feit money, and murderer.”—Ravaohol, the
Anarchist.
Dear Bulletin, —Your par, rc the Sydney
man who planted his head in a hole, reminds one
of a distinguished ornament to Q. Civil Service,
who called himself “High Priest,” “Messiah,”
* n d “King of Israel,” “King of England,”
King of the Cannibal Islands,” and various
kings. His children were “Princes” and
‘Princesses,” and one day, finding the eldest
prince was not growing fast enough, he planted
him up to his neck in the garden, and was found
carefully watering the top of his head by a
morning visitor.—M. Rule.
Item on private railway ownership, from
the Tennessee (U.S. A.) Nation :
Railroad men going back to work at Little Rock are
asked to make oath that they have withdrawn from the
A.R.U. and that they will not join any labor organisations
NOR TAKE ANT PART IN POLITICS FOR FIVE TEARS ! So writes
one of the victims to rne. Laboring people, do you know
what this means ? This is a more damnable slavery than
chattel slavery. This is the result of private ownership
of railways. This is so much better than the “political
patronage "of Government ownership 1 No king of whom
history tells us wanted his subjects to take any part in
politics, either. And that is just why King George 111.
sent his Hessians to this country. Our forefathers
desired to take some part in politics, and he wanted to do
all that business himself. And now the railroads are com-
pelling American citizens to allow the monopolies only to
take part in politics 1 1 And this is free America 1
One of the passengers by the train
which was wrecked at Redfern Station had
a series of experiences that morning. When
he had crawled out of the ruins, and assured him-
self that he wasn’t dead or even injured, he got
into a cab, but before it had gone 30 yards the cab
collided with a tram-car, and the shock drove bis
head into the window-frame and nearly broke his
neck. Then he got along safely for half-a-mile or
so until his vehicle became mixed up with an
omnibus, and one of the ’bus horses got its legs
over the shaft of the cab, and it and the cab-horse
proceeded to kick the hansom to flinders. But
even then the passenger escaped, the shock land-
ing him in a sitting position in the road, and when
he had gathered himself up once more he decided
to walk the rest of the way. What happened to
him afterwards isn’t known. According to the
eternal fitness of things, he should have found his
office burnt down, and then gone home to find his
wife dead, and his dog stolen.

A recent London murder-case revealed a
terrible accumulation of preventible horrors.
Prisoner was a mad husband who slaughtered his
wife soon after the birth of her eighth child. His
madness showed itself first in the honeymoon,
when the poor wretch bit pieces out of his bride’s
face and attempted to remove her tongue by the
roots. He was sent to an asylum, and discharged
in due course as a “cured ” patient. Thereafter
he suffered periodical lapses into raging lunacy,
followed regularly by removals to other asylums,
and restorations to what the doctors called
“sanity.” The woman doesn’t seem to have
sought protection against the advances of her
lunatic spouse, and went on adding to the popula-
tion as though she considered her offspring worthy
hostages to fortune. But when the eighth little
stranger was drawing nigh to nativity she did
implore the authorities of Colney Hatch madhouse (
to refrain from setting her husband free. The !
man being “ cured ” as usual, however, they turned
him loose with his certificate, and the wife’s
murder was perpetrated under specially brutal
circumstances.

An American paper tells a story of Chinese
justice. A Yankee trader had roamed into the
interior; where, having quarrelled with a mandarin,
he was imprisoned. There were 15 other prisoners
in the gaol, and one day an official came along and
sentenced them all to death in a batch. After
that they lay around for a week or so waiting
events, till one day they were taken up to the top
of a very high tower, and told to walk across a
wooden bridge to a similar tower, 50ft. distant.
Below, at a depth of 150 ft., was a paved courtyard
studded with spikes, varying from 12in. to five
yards in length. As the procession of malefactors
marched across, a trap door opened and one man
fell through. Then it shut again, and as the rest
of the condemned tramped on they saw him turn
over and over in the air, with his arms and legs
and pigtail flying abroad, and finally land on a
tall spike which impaled him and almost tore
him asunder. The rest got over safely. Next day
they were marched across again; they all carefully
dodged the spot where the first victim fell through,
but another trap opened in another part of the
bridge and a second man dropped. After that
for three days the company did its daily march
without accident, but on the fourth day traps
opened in all directions and three men went down
together. So they did their promenade with
varying fortunes, till at last only the Yankee
trader was left. He walked across the bridge
alone daily for a week, but the traps remained
shut, and at the end of that time he was suddenly
scruffed out of the gaol and ordered to leave the
province instantly. Which he did. He is still
alive, and spends his spare time in trying to figure
out whether he was really sentenced to death and
reprieved, or whether the episode was merely a
humorousMongolianwayof impressing on him that
foreigners aren’t wanted in the Chinese interior.

You’ve twenty pounds to spend—or twenty
pence, if you like. Your object is to get all you
require for the money you have, and you do not
desire even to contemplate the possibility of being
called upon for more. If you BUY OF US you
will get all you determined to secure, and have a
bit left for something else. Also, you will get the
best of everything—the goods of standard manu-
facturers. If you BUY ELSEWHERE your
TWENTY POUNDS, or your TWENTY
SHILLINGS, as the ease may be, will certainly
not go so far as you thought; you will either have
to SINK THE QUALITY, and be content with
inferior goods, or
Shell out more Cash .
Will that suit you ? We trow not. You’re no
fool. You’ve been wandering up and down this
blessed world for years and know your book.
One may say, “This is only assertion; where’s
your proof?” We reply that even as the quality
of that popular mixture of various compounds and
substances known as a pudding is proved by its
effect upon the constitution of the person who
assimilates it, so are we prepared with sound and
lucid demonstration. We say—Use your eyes,
exercise your judgment, criticise and compare.
Set your mental machinery to work, and convey
to your mind, through the medium of your organs

dowed, the impressions that will be yours, and

In a recent issue of the British Australasian
appear share quotations of 45 British loan, mortgage,

paying away the profits made there to English share-
holders. This only represents the fringe of the great
army of vultures, and takes no account of banks, private
investors, and syndicates and companies not officially
quoted. Truly the carcase is very lean these times. and
the birds of prey, who are called ‘‘foreign capital,” are
so many that there is hardly standing-room tor them

A Southern 600-percenter, the other day, ad-
vanced a large sum to one entitled to money on the
Continent, and took the usual power of attorney to collect
same and adjust accounts. However, the borrower went
to Europe per same steamer as the documents, and by
getting off at the first European port, got ahead of the
papers, which had to go round by way of London. He
collected all that was due, and left for other climes,
having thus supplemented his birthright by the Austra-
lian contribution.

day what his claim was against moneys due to a certain
fast youth, replied £lOOO. When asked to give a state-
ment to the solicitors he made out a claim for £2300, and
submitted the necessary documents to cover it. On the
solicitors showing fight and issuing a writ, it was settled
for £5OO, the original advance being £llO.

Mr. Yestikoff, ere his composition by arrange-
ment, did his old chum a good turn by giving him a lease
of a splendid suite of offices in the best part of the city on
a seven-years’ lease, and handing him a receipt for rent
for the full term. The mortgagees consented, thinking it
improved their security and rendered their interest more
secure to have such a lease. Of course the receipt was
not mentioned. When the composition by arrangement
had been completed some months, “ Old Chum ” was
asked for the rent and produced the receipt. As Mr.
Vestikoff was then on a continental tour, they had to fall
back on severe thoughts and bad language.

A certain Northern importer a year or two ago
took a partner, who introduced the large amount of £l5O
capital; their London correspondent was advised that the
new partner had introduced £5OOO. Some time after, the
partners quarrelled, and the last-comer withdrew his £l5O
and left. The original then wrote -’Orae and got his bills
renewed on the understanding that he had paid out his
partner with cash. After a time he got too deep in the
mire, and one of the London people came out, made him
insolvent, and made a microscopic search for the mythical
£5OOO. The lesson cost the London house £13,000.

Melb. tea-dealers do not now advertise for can-

samples, varying from 21bs. to lOlbs. in weight, but
few orders did the dealers get. Half the people in the
suburbs used to get their tea on the “ never.”

At a recent meeting of directors of a certain
mil Ing co. it was pointed out to the chairman that he
was incapacitated from presiding as his calls were unpaid.
Apologising for the inadvertence, he called for a cheque,
filled it up for the amount, and presided at the meeting.
Cheque was paid in and returned marked “No Account.”
Mr. Stiffun pouched a guinea as his director’s fee lor
attending the meeting. Was it false pretences?

A big haul awaits the Treasurer who passes a
bill ordering all banks to pay to Govt, all balances not
operated on for six years. Also, all balances and un-
o dined divs. of estates in the hands of trustees after six
months from declaration of last div., or, if insufficient
for declaration of div., six months after adjustment of
accounts. Pawnbrokers are compelled by law after the
expiration of the agreed or legal term of the loan to sell
by auction all pledges, and if the borrower turns up he
can claim any balance after adjustment of accounts, if
the claim be made within 12 months. Now, instead of
allowing Moses to sell to his own friends by his own
auctioneer and retain the balances why not have the
goods sold by a State auctioneer and get the balances paid
into the consolidated revenue at once? “ Oh, Rebecca,
such a law 1 Mine profits all gone !”

Mrs. Jessie Urquharb considered herself lucky
in leasing Mr, John Wesley Yowlraan’s semi-detached
cottage, as he had lived there himself, before moving next
door, and, being aretired plumber, had fitted it most com-
fortably with hot andoold baths, gas, wash-house, &c. When
she was there her gas bills were phenomenal ; the strictest
economy failed to reduce them. One evening she men-
t oned this to her nephew, a godless cyclist, who held
Mr. Yowlman in scorn. He turned the gas off at the
meter, and was not much surprised to observe the lights
go out in the holy Yowlman’s house. A plumber was
brought, and the mystery solved. St. Yowlman is to pay
two-thirds of all past gas-bills, has his little pipe cut off,
and defrays all expenses. Save the damage done to Mrs.
Urquhart’s faith in local-preachers full reparation has
been made.

Offices are advertised rent free, “best city posi-
tion ”in Melbourne. In scores of instances it has really
been a case of free rent during the last two years, for the
rent has been allowed (especially in connection with some
of the big buildings) to accumulate without the remotest
chance of its recovery.

Dear Bulletin, —The law laid down in a par.
in your last issue as to the effect of bankruptcy on_ a dis-
tress for rent is clearly wrong, so far as N.S.W. is con-
cerned. You say: “ A landlord can levy on any time-
payment furniture, but if the debtor files his schedule the
assets pass to the assignee, the time-payment man
resumes possession under his letting and hiring agree-
ment, and the landlord stands a preferential creditor for
three months’ rent—to his sorrow, as a rule.” Now, I’ll
show you where you are wrong. If a landlord levies a
distress for furniture under a bill of sale or hiring agree-
ment and the tenant becomes bankrupt, the distress is not
suspended, because the Bankruptcy Act only suspends
distress “as against the goods of the bankrupt.” When
Ikey Mo goes into possession under his bill of sale or
hiring agreement, as he usually does direolly he knows
the landlord is “ on the job ” —the furniture ceases from
that moment, in the eye of the law, to be in the posses-
sion of the tenant, and, therefore, instead of escaping
from the distress, it may be sold by the landlord as “ the
furniture of a stranger.” There can be no question about
the law as I have stated it, as it is based on the Privy
Council judgment in Railtou v. Wood, ii. N.S.W. Law
Reports, p. 474.— Pa010 Macari. [This seems conclusive
as regards N.S.W. But is it good law in Victoria?—Ed. B.j
Apropos of the above, The Bulletin is told of
a very simple way by which anyone who borrows money
on a bill of sale may, under the law of N.S.W., make
things extremely awkward for the lender—namely, by
the borrower giving notice to the lender that he has
“ suspended payment.” This is “an act of bankruptcy,”
and if the lender takes possession after receipt of this
notice, and the borrower becomes bankrupt within six
months, the bill of sale will be upset and the lender com-
pelled to pay over the value of the goods seized to the
official assignee—with a good lump of costs added. Under
the N.S.W. Bankruptcy Act, the holder of a bill of sale is
always entirely at the mercy of his mortgagor, who can
commit an act of bankruptcy—which will render the bill
of sale void—at any moment. Registration of a bill of
sale is of no avail unless the mortgagee gets into posses-
sion before he receives notice of “ an act of bankruptcy.”

Sydney retail shopkeepers complain bitterly of
the competition they endure from the warehouses, who
are killing the goose that lays the golden egg. When
Simpkins, of the Civil service or the bank, wants a
macintosh, or a pipe, or a brooch for his best girl, he
knows a friend in some big establishment, who gets it for
him at a discount on wholesale price. The same with
tailoring ; cloth is bought in like manner, and given to
the tailor to make up. A well-known “snip” states that
quite half the suits he cuts now-a-days are made from
material supplied by customers, who deprive him of his
profit on the cloth.

In answer to a correspondent, J.L. (Kurnalpi) :
—The discovery (250 8.C.) over which Archimedes cried
“ Eureka ” is that which enables the gold contents of
quartz to be very closely estimated without dollying or
fracturing the specimen. It is a question of specific
gravities. The specific gravity of any substance is its
weight compared bulk for bulk with water. If native
gold were always of the same fineness, and quartz always
of the same composition, the problem would be simpler
than it is. Native gold, generally speaking, is 17J to 18i
times heavier than water, and quartz is generally figured
at 2'65 times heavier than water. In practice, of course,
the quality of the gold and quartz in a specimen could be
estimated by experiment with other specimens found in
the immediate vicinity. To obtain the specific gravity of
the specimen : weigh specimen in usual manner, then
weigh with specimen immersed in water. The “ support”
of the water will cause a certain loss in weight. This
“ loss ” is equal to the weight of the water displaced. The
“loss” divided into the weight in air gives the specific
gravity. It must be remembered that the “specific
gravity” of a substance is not so many ounces. _ The
assay fineness of a sovereign is not its weight, nor is the
“ water” of a diamond its weight. Specific gravity is a
measurement of comparative heaviness, just as the assay
is a measure of purity. The size of a man’s boot is 8.
8 what? “Just 8,” the man would say. NotB inches, or
8 ounces, but 8 dimensions according to a none too simple
standard. Similarly, *hen we speak of the specific gravity
of gold we mean that it has, say, 18 dimensions of heavi-
ness. A formula for working out the gold contents of a
quartz specimen is here given
Gold contents ... =* '
Weight of specimen = m
Specific gravity of do = n -
Specific gravity of gold = r
Specific gravity of quartz = I .
(n— »)r
Then * = tn x
(*•—») n
Let us break this jargon down by taking an imaginary
specimen. Its weight shall be 100 troy : its specific gravity
shall be considered as 10. For a rough calculation weoan
put down the specific gravity of gold and quart* as 18 and
23 respectively. Then our calculation wall read:—
(10—2§) xlB
Gold contents =■ 100 x
(18-23) x 10
100 x 7J x 18 3900
15J x 10 40

One Melbourne pen-lady made .£4OOO in mining
during the boom, and lost the bigger part of it in trams
—and not in dress. Her speculations turned out to be
good investments, but her investment was a bad spec.
Bowes-Kelly and Knox were two of the lady’s financial
advisers. To those whom he knows Bowes-Kelly is one
of the safest of mining coaches.

Civil servants have a big say in the ownership
of the Queen of the Ranges, Bright (N.S.W.), which
owns a hill (more or less) full of gold, two shoots, three
tram-lines, and a battery. Mostly surface-stone is picked
up on top of the hill and sent down to the battery at the
bottom; and, as shovelling isn't allowed, the miners
darting here and there after loose lumps of quartz look
just as if they were potato-racing. Thanks to cheap
working, the co. hopes to make 3dwts. pay.

Dear Bulletin, —What has become of the cele-
brated Southern Cross pearl, which, at the time of its
discovery at Roeburne, W.A., was valued at £10,000? It
was found in 1874 by the crew of “ Shiner ” Kelly’s
schooner, the Ethel, and when “Shiner” saw it, taking
it for a heaven-wrought miracle, he buried it, and did not
unearth it until the early eighties. It consisted of nine
pearls naturally grown together so as to form a perfect
cross, and was, perhaps, the most unique natural jewel
extant.—Fours, Robbcrnb.

Unless Q. Government is careful, the pearl-
shelling industry will soon be a thing of the past. Pearl-
shellers are very properly forbidden to export shell of less
than six inches diameter. But private capitalistic com-
panies remove this very shell to their own private cultiva-
tion-grounds, thereby driving the small man to the wall.
The removal of all shell under the specific diameter should
be strictly regulated.
Ex-Premier Salisbury says that “ only
physical force will overthrow the House of Lords.”
Which is obviously mere Tory vapouring. The
House of Lords will vanish like a spook a,t day-
break when a bill is passed in the usual quiet way
through both Houses, and assented to in the usual
way by the monarch, declaring that the Upper
Chamber shall exist no longer. The Commons
will pass it when there is a big enough Democratic
majority to support a Democratic Government,
and both these will come. The monarch will
assent to it when the Democratic majority is
sufficiently large to show him or her that the only
safe proceeding is to assent. And the Lords will
concur peacefully when the Democratic Govern-
ment, backed by its overwhelming majority in the
Commons and its overawed monarch, creates five
or six hundred new peers, or as many more as may
be necessary, all pledged to vote for abolition.
Probably, however, there will be no need to
create any new peers. When the choice lies
between going quietly with their dignity unim-
paired, or going in any case and having the peer-
age so diluted that dukes would be two a penny
and marquises eight for sixpence, it is ten chances
to one that the Lords will go quietly.
Perhaps the most pertinent query of all
the host which have followed the recent Sydney
spook-eruption is “ What do spooks live on ?” If
they can eat chocolate-creams they must have a
stomach to put them in, and then what else do
they put in their stomachs when chocolate-creams
are “off?” This question, however, was answered
once and for all in the heyday of spiritualism 40
years ago—when spirits first, at Home’s command,
arose, from out the azure main. Spooks cannot
carry weight through the blue ethereal, and their
sole sustenance, apart from casual confectionery,
is that subtly invigorating compound, the essence
of good spirits, Marshall’s Tonic Nervine. Sold

Russia: An Ode.
Out of hell a word comes hissing, dark as doom,
Fierce as fire, and foul as plague-polluted gloom ;
Out of hell wherein the sinless damned endure
More than ever sin conceived of pains impure,
More than ever ground men’s living souls to dust;
Worse than madness ever dreamed of murderous
Since the world’s wail first went up from lands
and seas
Ears have heard nob, tongues have told not things
Dante, led by"love’s and hate’s accordant spell
Down the deepest and the loathliest ways ot hell,
Where beyond the brook of blood the ram was
fire, . , ,
Where the scalps were masked with dung more
deep than mire, . ,
Saw nob, where the filth was foulest, and the night
Darkest, deaths whose fiends could match the
Muscovite. . . .
Set beside this truth, his deadliest vision seems
Pale and pure and painless as a virgin’s dreams.
Maidens dead beneath the clasping lash, and
wives
Rent with deadlier pangs than death —for shame
survives.
Naked, mad, starved, scourged, spurned, frozen,
fallen, deflowered,
Souls and bodies as by fangs of beast devoured,
Filth of raging crime and shame that crime
enjoys, . . . ...
Age made one with youth in torture, girls with
boys,
These, and worse, if aught be worse than these
things are,
Prove thee regent, Russia —praise thy mercy,
Czar.
Help is none in heaven: hope sees no gentler star:
Earth is hell, and hell bows down before the Czar.
All its monstrous, murderous, lecherous births
acclaim _
Him whose empire lives to match its fiery flame.
Nay, perchance at sight or sense of deeds here
done,
Here where men may lift up eyes to greet the sun,
Hell recoils heart-stricken ; horror worse than hell
Darkens earth and sickens heaven; life knows the
spell, . . .
Shudders, quails and sinks —or, filled with fierier
breath,
Rises red in arms devised of darkling death.
Pity mad with passion, anguish mad with shame,
Call aloud on justice by her darker name ;
Love grows hate for love’s sake; life takes death
for guide. .
Night hath none but one red star—Tyrannicide,
God or man, be swift; hope sickens with delay
Smite, and send him howling down his father’s

The Rev. H. Toungman’s recent experience
of the Queensland Never Never is that the people
there are distinguished for a large hospitality and
a low morality. Which recalls a certain famous

Dear Bulletin, —It’s no news that the
goburra eats young birds. All the kingfishers
will eat anything they can master, and I’ve known
“ Jack ’’—the biggest of the tribe—get as far as a
duckling. It’s nob for harmlessness he’s “ pro-
tected,” but partly as a snake-slayer and partly as
a “representative Australian.” — Halcto.
Dear Bulletin, —“ L.” writes as one who
knows about the havoc committed by the kooka-
burra. I’ve often seen them demolish clutches of
chickens, and have, in defence of said clutches,
been compelled to break the law and slay the
laughing-jackass. Like all the kingfisher tribe,
they are remorselessly cruel and often kill for no
other reason than lust of blood.— Wurrt M.
Editor Bulletin, — “L” discounts the
popular virtues of our sedate countryman, the
laughing jackass. It is true the jackass preys nob
only on young, but also upon all small birds.
Perhaps not the sombre-plumed kukuburra, bub
the bright-winged bird I have often seen dine off
small full-grown birds in Central Queensland.
City men tell yarns of the laughing jackass killing
large snakes, bub bushmen say that he can only
kill very small ones, simply for food, as he eats
almost any small living thing. With the crow and
the cockatoo he shows creditable reasoning powers.
If one is surface gold-prospecting a few hours in
the ranges a passing kukuburra is sure to alight on
some convenient bough near the trench, and after
some jubilant hops he settles down to wait. A
few tense elevations of his tail, from time to time,
remind the prospector working below that the bird
is keeping a hold on his balance, ready for a dive
at the expected worm. The smallest moving worm
does nob escape his fixed gaze and aching void.
The jackass is as good as the birds he sometimes
destroys, so let him live and laugh.— Jaokbird.
Another Bulletin story from Isis (Q.)
Advocate (nig. labor organ). Writes one St.
Quintin Hill : ]
Par away from Australia is the Thames, a part of which
is called the Isis, while Childers is not far away nor
Abingdon. It is the day before the Henley Regatta and
the two young Bells (Sir Joshua’s sons) are to compete.
The writer receives his mails, amongst which are The
Bulletin, Maryborough Chronicle, Gympie Miner, and
Times, and the Bundaberg Mail, all sent on by friends.
A very old Church of England clergyman asks to see the
papers and retires. Interested in the smaller papers he
asks the writer about “gold finding ” at Gympie and
sugar at Bundaberg. Then he takes his little skiff and
rowingusto the nearest bank avoidingthe necessary lasher,
he produces The Bulletin and says that he has read it
through “My boy,” says the old man, “is that a lead-
ing paper in your new country ?” Our reply is, “ Yes, it
is the leading paper. “Then,” replied the old man,
“ God save Australia, for it has the hand of Satan upon
It." We rowed to Henley, and saw the Bells and their
crew win. Advance Australia 1 in spite of Satan.
But then that very old Church of England clergy-
man did read The Bulletin “ through ” after all-
The “I Was Dreaming” waltz, by Leon
Caron, was played by the Australian Military
Band at Flemington on Derby and Cup days—
still another proof of its wide popularity. It is
the ambition of every composer to have his little
piece played at Flemington during the racing
carnival, bub very few indeed arrive at that
blessed consummation. It is easier to get through
the eye of a needle than to satisfy the require-
ments of Zelman, who regards his band as the
hub of the universe.

Dawn in the Bush.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The Sun had opened his gates, and cast
A wealth of light on the night-bound world.
The Night fled onward to where at last
She might reign with the black of her flags
unfurled.
Red lights to eastward in grey lights lay,
And a thousand song-birds sang in the day.
The Night fled onward, but swifter feet
Than Night’s were fleet to o’ercome her flight.
The Dawn had caught her with one wide beat
Of the wings that scattered her shades with light.
With reddened footsteps, and eyes of fire,
Came the Primal Light of the world’s desire.
The wattles trembled, and, trembling, sighed
Their sharp, sweet breaths on a wind of morn,
And swayed their heads, that the sun might hide
In their gleaming bodies the gold of dawn.
The tender sadness of early day
Lit up with the sheen of that wattled way.
The little gums, where the paddocks lean
To the withered creeks, made a line of red,
As light stole on through the tall trees green.
Till it burnt the tops of each lithe young head.
The tall gums, glimmering grey and brown,
Were a shadowy band in a silver crown.
Away to east, on the creek’s far side,
Beyond the shade of the short shea-oaks,
Great flannel-daisies broke white and wild
Through the grey-green grass of the paddock
slopes,
And caught the sun on their velvet heads,
And carried its gleams to their sandy beds.
The sarsaparilla’s slim clinging vine
Crept warm and red, over earth and shale.
An early snake shed a moving line
Of reflected light on its sunlit trail.
The tiny dews of the overnight
Set a trembling mirror to catch all light.
A wild clematis made rank and rich,
With starry blossoms a myrtle grim,
Gone black long since in a lightning’s stitch,
But revived in the white of this wild-flower’s
whim,
And sweet once more with the perfect breath
Of the pallid petals that graced its death.
For one brief breath-time of cool delight
The blue-gums murmured their wind-won tune;
Too soon, too soon would the sun-rays slight
With the glare of the tierce Australian noon,
And quell their crooning, and quench the dew
From their leaves, and wither with fire their blue.
The Sun went on up his old-world groove.
And lazy lizards began to stir
Prom their stone-retreats, and the birds to move,
With a twitter and sweep, through the early air.
Red lights to eastward from grey lights grew,
And the Bush was glad that the day was new.

Dear Bulletin, —Ross Cox’s “course of
nature” was merely an adroit combination of two
previously-existing accounts of such an experi-
ment. One—a hoax, itself—represents the inves-
tigation as conducted for James L, with result
that the primordial language was (of course!) found
to be Hebrew. Of the other experiment—actually
made by Ptolemy Psammetichos —the resulting
first word was the Lydian “bek-bek” —“bread,”
shrewdly suspected, however, by Ptolemy himself
to be no more than imitation of the voice of the
goat that suckled the youngsters.—A.M.
Dear Bulletin, —The dogmatic “Sugar
Doodle” is shaky in facts and hasty in deduc-
tions. “ S.D.” is a ped., and has flat feet—there-
fore all peds. have flat feet, and the flat foot is the
normal foot! Some famous runners have had
notably high insteps, and that feet differ normally
as much as noses is a fact amply recognised in the
classic sculptures cited by “S.D.” The “pitch ”
of the metatarsal arch varies both individually
and racially, and, while the boot-modified foot
often combines flat sole with constricted toes, the
never-booted extremity frequently joins arched
instep with well-spread toes. The Papuan peoples,
for instance, are much flatter-footed than the
Malaysian, and the highest in.-teps I have ever
seen were among the Dyak women—shoeless
descendants of shoeless generations.— Macassar.

Dear Bulletin, —Piloting Chinese over
the N.S.W. border has become a regular industry
here (Corowa). Not fewer than 10 or 12 a week
have crossed from Victoria for the last 12 months,
and never a word of poll-tax. A local police-
officer states that he could fill the gaol with
evaders and their allies every week if required.
Much of the clearing and other work throughout
Riverina and elsewhere in N.S.W. is done by
Chinese —even to shearing and wool-scouring.
Chinese now monopolise the Vic. cabinet-making
industry; they have a good grip of the wine
industry ; and in a few years N.S.W. bush labor
will be their province exclusively if they oome in
unchecked—for there are always men greedy
enough to employ them. There is a large Chinese
camp at Wahgunyah with six stores, and most of
the storekeepers take contracts for scrubbing and
clearing in N.S. Wales. They are allowed to
bring Chinese over the border, under promise to
return them; but the promise is never kept. —

to the persistent public advocates). Nevertheless, the
physical defects or sinister notions of those who affect to
be the mouthpieces of intelligent feminity are as potent
an argument against woman-suffrage as the gyrations of a
Gaiety girl are against the Copernican system. Whenever
it requires no prophetic vision to foresee that any political
movement is destined to succeed, under the banner of
that movement will be found knavish notoriety-hunters
and wary political-axe-grinders; just as urchins, under
the pretence of giving a helping shove to the fire-engine
of a volunteer brigade, get a lift to the scene of the
pyrotechny and enjoy simultaneously the satisfaction
of having assisted in a good cause. Now, if it be
just to exclude from the franchise those “she-
males ” who have demonstrated their incapacity
to bear and also those who never had an oppor-
tunity of doing so, why not also the impotent male
who has delayed getting “reformed” till too late?
(for scientifically he is as great an exception to Nature’s
grand dichotomy as the aforesaid shemale). “ Unre-
formed" puts it: “No representation unless taxed.’’
All right! When the incidence of taxation is shifted to
land, income and shares—as it assuredly will be—then the
only voters will be “proputty” (and the incidence will
then rapidly revert). This prophecy of the destruction of
the marriage-tie is precisely analogous to Fatmau’s pre-
diction of blood-deluged streets and bomb-shattered piles
that ware to ensue on manhood suffrage. No! trust to
the sensible matrons (fortunately immensely outweigh-
* n K thnse pitiable curiosities whom your correspon-
refef? *®) t 0 see that marriage is the theoretical
”j & Sml"'?.’ th^XS
of the instinct of self-presirvation, ennobled and dignified
by evolution ; seeing which they will maintain them
John Haynes’ Herculean argument about “duplication
ou sht to be embalmed as a sample of the colossal
genius of the politicians of our day: “ All women would

»e family discord, all I ve got to say is that the woman
who, by poli ical bickering, would cause strife in the
family should he labelled, by a State bill-poster, “not to
be lived with,” and the man of similar tendencies should
be relegated to a State monastery. But, with our secret
