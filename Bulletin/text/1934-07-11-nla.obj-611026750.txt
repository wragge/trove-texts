FACTS!
The only type of
circulation that
lias real worth is that which is constant and
embodies the confidence of readers. These
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by leal merit. They are
bought because people want them in their
homes.
The daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even In times of
economic stress he continues to buy his
morning daily, so valuable is it for the
information it gives, both in its news and
advertisement columns.
Newspaper advertising is the most economical,
effective and forcible medium for reaching
the New Zealand public.

HIS BOOKS
Decline and Fall of British
Liberalism
IHere are two books which should in-
terest students of politics. Between them
they give a fairly complete history of
British Liberalism from its lusty man-
hood under Gladstone to its death under
Lloyd George. This, the only inter-
national party that has ever flourished at
Westminster, was murdered on the Con-
tinent ; in England it went into a gentle
decline, and passed out so unobtrusively
in the end that no one bothered to give
its death certificate.
No doubt the primary factor was that
recoil from democracy which is changing
the structure of civilisation all over
Europe. Liberalism stood for free speech
and freedom of action within the frame-
work of the law: ideals which are abhor-
rent to the party system with its pre-
selected candidates and regimented
opinions and votes. But a contributory
cause, as in Italy, was the appearance of
Liberals of the wrong kind. British
Liberalism ceased to attract Nonconform-
ist support in proportion as it became
fashionable and lost interest in the
crusades against drink, prostitution, v.d.
and other social evils which used to be
launched periodically by Exeter Hall.
Nineteenth Century
Sir Robert Lunn, whose Nearing
Harbor has been published by Nicholson
and Watson at 10s. 6d., supplies an almost
flawless self-portrait of a Giadstonian
Liberal. He was born into the faith, his
father, a Lincolnshire druggist, having
been one of those middle-class Metho-
dists who came into their kingdom with
the Reform Bill of 1868. Like his father,
Robert Lunn went in for lay-preaching ;
he also had an “instinctive grasp of busi-
ness possibilities in unusual directions.”
He made a small fortune in the late
’seventies by supplying materials for
lawn tennis —known in those days of its
infancy as sphrairistike.
He decided, at 21, to give up busi-
ness and become a Methodist missionary
in India ; which he did by way of Dublin
University. In one respect he seems to
have differed from most earnest Method-
ists of his day; he had no sectarian
prejudices. He must have found this
an advantage when he left the ministry—
his health had broken down in India —
and started the business with which his
name is chiefly associated.
Lunn’s Tours originated in the Grindel-
wald Conference which the ex-missionary
organised in 1892 “to consider how far
the divisions of Christendom were thwart-
ing the Divine purpose, and in what way
those divisions could be healed.” Some-
one else would have entered this field
if he hadn’t. England had reached a
stage which Australia arrived at only the
other day ; all classes were determined to
see something of the world outside their
own country. In the following year he
took 440 people to Rome at 20 guineas
each, and in 1894 he organised cruises to
Palestine, Egypt, Athens and Constan-
tinople on similarly easy terms.
Meanwhile he was leading a full life
in other directions. He and his friends
supported Gladstone’s agitation against
the Armenian massacres, to the annoy-
ance of Lord Rosebery, the titular leader
of the party. Lord Rosebery, an Im-
perialist and a racing man with an inborn
contempt for Exeter Hall and its ideals,
was the forerunner of a type of Liberal
who was to do much to ruin the party
in the years ahead. Lunn was a militant
pro-Boer. Invited to a luncheon in 1900
at which Chamberlain was to preside, he
refused on the ground that Chamberlain
was an accomplice “in one of the greatest
crimes ever committed by Englishmen—
the Jameson Raid.” Asquith got him his
knighthood in 1910. In the following
year he joined with Bishop Temple, who
had co-operated in the Exeter Hall cam-
paign for music-hall reform, in an effort
to minimise ill-
feeling over
Welsh Disestab-
lishment ; and he
also worked hard
to keep ill-feeling
out of the Home
Rule struggle.
It was inevitable that he should com
into 'conflict with Lloyd George afte
the war. Versailles scandalised him, anc
he considered Lloyd George’s action
the 1926 strike “disastrous.” He wrote
year later that the Coupon Election hat
“shattered the Liberal party just when th
world needed the application of Libera;
principles,” and he concluded:
We decline to accept the dictates of any-
one, however large his funds and however
brilliant his gifts, whose political record is
inconsistent with high ethical standards and
genuine Liberalism.
With the changes in moral values whic
appeared as the post-war generation
grew up the veterans of Liberalism bega
to appear a little ridiculous. Ironically
Lunn’s Tours did almost as much as th
war to destroy the belief that Low Churc
Protestantism and the British Sabbath
were essential to national greatness-—on
of the foundations of the Liberal creec
in England.
Post-War
Robert Bernays, M.P., author o 1
Special Correspondent (Gollancz; Bs. 6d.)
had the misfortune to be a Liberal whei
he went up to Oxford shortly before the
general strike. So his book, in so far as i
deals with British politics, is pervaded by
the melancholy of a disappointed man
The part which Ramsay MacDonalc
played in the 1929 election disgustec
Mr. Bernays. If MacDonald had co-oper
ated with Lloyd George then “a really
stable Radical majority might have been
created.”
Mr. Lloyd George had a programme of
social reconstruction which would have
made the Parliament that carried it out as
memorable as any of the great reforming
Parliaments in the past.
Mr. MacDonald seems to have looked at
it from the angle of a party politician
The proposed Lloyd George reforms were
no doubt in line with Liberal tradition
But the country had ceased to associate
their author with Liberal principles. Anc
what sensible office-seeker would join
up with a party whose leader had been
guilty of so many major mistakes as the
controller of the mysterious Liberal
Fund? There is nothing about Mr.
Lloyd George which appeals to possessors
of the Nonconformist conscience: the
electors who made the great Liberals of
the past and who are now turning favor-
able eyes on Socialists of the stamp of
Rosslyn Mitchell, the evangelising Glas-
gow solicitor whose speech on the Prayer
Book made such a sensation in the Com-
mons seven years ago.
British politics aside, Special Corre-
spondent is a spirited account of the
author’s travels in Germany, Denmark,
R.ussia, the Balkans arid elsewhere. In
Germany his name caused him to be
taken for a Jew, so he is able to speak
at first-hand on the crazy lengths to which
anti-Semitism is carried among the Nazis.
He evidently foresaw some of the horrors
which were to come, but he didn’t foresee
all of them. Ernst Heines, who has just
been shot (“a charming fellow—young,
fair hair, blue eyes, smiling”), was
Police President of Silesia when Mr.
Bernays visited the Polish Corridor.
The author arrived in Australia with
Lord Beauchamp four years ago, and he
has many pleasant things to say about
us. Accuracy is not his strong point.
He thinks W. M. Hughes was Australia’s
first Labor Prime Minister ; that he sent
the Fisher message about the “last man
and the last shilling,” and that Lord
Somers was Governor-General.

of my hair. It has turned it from
its dry, dead, straw-looking color back
to its original shade of brown, and
now, after about three weeks’ use, I

over my head. It’s growing like wild-
fire. I might mention that I never
gave your treatment a very fair go,
either.”—o. J. Reynolds, M.', N.Z.
“After using your course for one
week my hair stopped falling and

my hair is as healthy as it is possible

experenced.” In Chapter I we are
launched into the serious business of
“Riding Kit.” An alternative is offered
between leggins and top boots, and we
learn that only for hunting is a stock
really needed, “and one can either have
a tie or nothing at all as it is not a great
necessity.” A bowler hat (illustrated) is
recommended for safety. And for winter
hunting “a pretty thick coat to keep out
all the cold.” The coat, of course, should
have a slit at the back. Gloves, crop,
spurs are also illustrated, with appro-
priate hints.

stop learning all the different names, in
fact one learns them at each stage, and
so on, till one time they come in very
useful, not counting it as being most inter-
esting, for instance, say if your father
was going to give you a pony, he would
very likely say “first, you must learn the
names of a ponies points, do you know
them?” What would happen if you
didn’t? Well, here they are for you to
try and fix in your memory.
And so, by means of an ample illustra-
tion, together with 2\ pages of informa-
tion, we learn all about “a ponies points.”
In the second part we are introduced
to jumping. The young woman has
evidently hunted over an assortment of
country.
In Warwickshire you will find out hunt-
ing the hedges are very easy for “scim-
ming” over as they consist of either
clipped “brush” or “cut and layed,” which
are not much more than 3ft. At Melton,
top, they are all clipped. The Hertford-
shire hedges are thick and wide, with
many a “blind ditch,” and the “Percy
Hunt” in Northumberland, have chiefly
stone walls.
Chapter VIII deals with showing. The
information is characterised by great
wisdom, and our ambition is tempted
by a realistic drawing of a cup. The
chapter closes with some useful tips.
If your pony is given a rosette tie it
either to your head band or the cheek
strap, but if you have not time place it
between your teetth. Never gallop round
the ring when you have had a ribbon,
always canter. If you are showing at
Olympia, boys, always take your hats off
the second time round, and if you are
given a ribbon, girls, you cannot do this,
but smile sweetly at the judge and hope
for the best!
The thing is surprisingly well done
for a child, and it is significant as show-
ing the passionate love of horses which
the British retain despite the march of
the motor-car. This little girl is a cousin
of the Duchess of York, whose father,
Lord Strathmore, has written an intro-
duction. Not the least interesting feature
is a reproduction of a letter to Mr. Dent
in which she thanks him for agreeing to
publish her book and ends “with love
and many thanks from Sarah.” If only
there were more of this spirit between
writer and publisher!
GERALD DILLON.
A Lady in Quest of Art
Wild Flowers and Wanderings, by
May Brookes (printed in Paris; Robert-
son and Mullens; 25.), begins brightly:
Yes, lam writing a book! Or, more
precisely, preparing my document of Life
and Art. Why should you write a book,
scream all my friends in mirth, horror or
amazement. You studied singing, you
paint flowers (that is ladylike!), land-
scapes, against your fellow-painters’ ad-
vice; you have even ventured to try your
hand at pottery Why take all this
trouble to search for souls and all that
sort of thing? It’s not modern! In fact,
it’s not done, now.
This Victorian lady exhibits a genuine
—in fact, an intense—love of art, in-
spired by the natural beauties of the
Brookes home at Macedon. But, taken
to Europe, she went “literally tennis-mad,
and travelled from one tournament to
another.” Then the war came.
I dropped my golf clubs and Norman
his tennis racquet, and we both commenced
to think of how we could be of service
to the wonderful men who joined up so
readily to do their bit for our Empire.
Red Cross work took them to Egypt,
whence the brother went to France and
then to Mespot. In Egypt Miss Brookes
sang to soldiers, and met generals, diplo-
mats and statesmen. Her quarters were
one of the attractions of the place, for,
“with characteristic impetuosity, I com-
menced to transform my apartments....
into something approaching ancient
Egyptian splendor and beauty. On enter-
ing my hall, visitors were greeted by a
veritable Egyptian tent.”
After the Armistice, the lady crossed
to Trieste and so to Paris, where she
revelled in the atmosphere of art, its
galleries, its Louvre and its historic asso-
ciations. In England she was struck with
“what appeared to be much misery and
poverty,” and the contrast with her care-
free days before the war caused her “to
feel the urge to create again.” She began
to paint wildflowers, and was astounded
when her painting, which was entirely
without “school,” was likened by one
critic of note to that of an old Dutch
master. After a diatribe against the Age
of Machinery, she concludes that the
secret of Beauty and Happiness is “just
the feeling of being in tune with the
Infinite.”
F.S.
Luck and Literature
We have all heard of the novel which
Gladstone picked up by chance and
which proved to be “John Inglesant” ; of
how posthumous fame came to Mary
Webb, and of how Galsworthy made
Thornton Wilder and the “Bridge of
San Luis Rey” popular in America. Such
events serve to remind us that success
in letters is not entirely a matter of
merit. Also, an author is helped
materially if he knows the right people
or has been to the right school. All the
wealth of the House of Lords may not
be able to make the English buy a book,
but judicious puffing in the right quarter
can mislead enough of them to exhaust
a first edition.
It is curious to recall novels which
have been refused over and over again,
and which, when published, have met
with good receptions. Who could con-
ceive any publisher failing to recognise
the best-seller elements in Compton Mac-
kenzie? His “Passionate Elopement”
was refused by the leading publishers
in London, and it was only when re-
duced to despair that he sent the book
to Martin Seeker, then starting in the
publishing world. Thomas Burke’s
“Nights in Town” and “Limehouse
Nights” were amazingly popular in their
day. Yet Burke’s first book was rejected
11 times. Jeffery Farnol’s “Broad High-
way” was cast out so often that he gave
it up as a bad job. It was only when
his wife rescued it from his desk that
it went to a publisher for the last time.
Such experiences have been repeated in
almost every field, from the pictures re-
fused by the French Salon of 1863, which
were exhibited in the Salon des Refuses
and form the first show of the Impres-
sionists, to the rejection of Noel Coward’s
“Vortex”—accepted in the end because
one producer happened to slip it by acci-
dent into his brief-case when going to the
country for a week-end. Theatrical
people seem to be the worst judges of
all. “Unknown Purple,” which was re-
jected by six New York producers on the
ground that the public would not tolerate
a scene in which a wife failed to recog-
nise her husband, ran for a year and a
half; Charles Frohman would not have
“Ben Hur” and lived to see it make over
£200,000.
In some instances (Sinclair Lewis is an
outstanding case) early books have been
written to sell and have failed to sell,
and success has come to the author when
he has turned to another style and writ-
ten to please himself. The explanation is
that the public will not tolerate insin-
cerity. If you write the stories of Ethel
M. Dell you must have the type of mind
which can believe in the stories of Ethel
M. Dell if you wish to be commercially
successful.
There is, of course, the integrity of the
good workman, the sort of thing which
led Galsworthy to write his novels several
times over, which caused Margaret Ken-
nedy to make three distinct versions of
“The Constant Nymph” and kept Sin-
clair Lewis revising “Martin Arrow-
smith” for nine months. The novelist,
after all, likes to turn out a good job.
But what happens to his brain-child after
it is given to the world is largely a
matter of luck. In the flood of books
which pour into an over-bright publicity
for a few moments and then disappear
into the second-hand shops and the
papermakers’ works, how could it be
otherwise? Few books sell at all a year
after they are published, and in an age
when there is overproduction in books
as in everything else it is as much luck
as merit which leads to the survival of
the better writers. How otherwise could
such a man as Herman Melville drop
out of sight, only to be rescued by a
centenary?
QUENTIN POPE.
A Satchel of Books
You’re Telling Me (N.S.W. Bookstall
Co.: 4s. 6d.) is by W. S. Howard, who
seems to know the people and places he
writes about. He presents a pair of
young journalists who conduct a weekly
sheet in a Sydney suburb. Their pursuit
of advertisers, their romances, their
binges and their struggles to get their
paper out are racily described. Much of
the humor is oVer-obvious, and some of
the characters are overdrawn. Still, it’s an
acceptable lightweight; and it might have
been still more acceptable without the
Hollywood title.
Winifred Birkett’s first novel, Three
Goats on a Bender (Angus and Robert-
son ; 65.), doesn’t pretend to be great
literature, but it’s very good fun. Connie
and Marjorie Newbigging find themselves,
under the terms of an eccentric will, the
custodians of an ancient house near
Camden which has become a sort of his-
torical museum. Kindly Auntie Pat
stands by as chaperon to see that every-
thing is aboveboard, and their adventures
with the rascally old lawyer, the strange
intruder, the ghosts and the goats lead
them pleasantly to the goal of every nice
girl.
As Good as a Mile, by Edward
Albert (Nicholson and Watson ; 7s. 6d.),
is rightly listed as “a tale of terror, mys-
tery and adventure.” The opening chap-
ters deal with life at a Scottish univer-
sity during the triennial election for the
rectorship, and then the principal char-
acters proceed to the Western Hebrides.
There are plenty of murders and other
thrills while the Search for the Mysteri-
ous Eye is going on ; and the hero and
heroine just squeeze through, and to-
gether, on the last page but one.
The hero of Edwin N. Speer’s Destiny
(Jackson and O’Sullivan; 65.) is Neville
Tinnabel, an Englishman. He loses his
first girl in a hunting-field smash, and is
going to the Devil when Girl No. 2
comes along and stops the rot. Other
girls follow. Thelma (“beautiful, mer-
cenary, cold and a ‘climber’ ”) manoeuvres
him into marrying her. Then come
the war, a break with Thelma and Aus-
tralia. In Melbourne Neville goes under
again. Believe it or not, it is the N.S.W.
Main Roads Board that plays dens ex
machinal The board gives him a job
on a lonely part of the Cooma-Kosciusko
road, and he regains health and sanity.
Some of Mr. Speer’s mannerisms—pigs
“giving a defiant tongue,” “their porcine
pibroch disturbed the tranquil air” and
“she frequently threw fraternisation on
the down wind, rousing the Scotch ter-
rier’s tartan suspicions”—are irritating ;
but he has a definite personality, and he
makes it felt. The novel is easy to read
in spite of its style, and the characters
live.
In Blue North (Endeavour Press ; 65.),
Henrietta Drake-Brockman has captured
the glamor of the Westralian pearl-
ing grounds in the ’seventies. “Hand-
some” Jack Fordyce, tiring of his Eng-
lish wife’s hysterics and extravagances,
sets sail in the Sea Sprite for whatever
adventures the north-west coast may offer.
Putting in at Cossack he bewitches the
town’s only barmaid and incurs the dis-
pleasure of Baia Budson. It is in Cos-
sack that he rescues Sophie Gannet from
the base hands of Budson, and, in defi-
ance of the conventions, shelters her in
the Sea Sprite. Halcyon days follow.
New bays and channels are explored ;
more and more pearls come to light;
hero and heroine fall in love. There
is a stirring finish when the little Sea
Sprite is caught in one of the dreaded
willy-willies, and those aboard are either
drowned or swept ashore on the inhospit-
able sands. No masterpiece, but an en-
tertaining yarn by one who knows the
country and who has a notable gift for
dialogue.
Maud Diver’s latest novel, The Singer
Passes (Blackwood ; Bs. 6d.), isn’t nearly
so interesting as most of her earlier ones.
There is far too much valueless discussion
as to whether India would be benefited by
political freedom or not, and the story,
such as it is, moves slowly. Sir Roy Sin-
clair, son of Lilamani, has been married
11 years when he feels the urge to return
to India. He finds many changes:
Gandhi, and Congress, and a growing dis-
position among the more cultured women
to throw off old-time restrictions. Also,
much that has not changed: the aloof-
ness between Indian and European, the
ostracism consequent upon mixed blood.
He meets all classes as a titled English-
man and as a member of a respected
Rajput family, and collects impressions
of the country as the basis of a book
that is intended to show England the
real India.
Vincent Pantin’s What Is National
Credit ? (published by the author in Syd-
ney at 25.) unfolds a plan for wiping out
Australia’s national debt, external and
domestic, cutting out taxes on earned
incomes, reducing the effective interest
rate to very nearly zero, stabilising the
value of domestic currency, giving every
willing worker employment and abolish-
ing booms and depressions. How’s it to
be done? The answer turns out to be
a very old friend —the capital levy. Two
and a half p.c. p.a. on all private capital
wealth in Australia will, according to
Mr. Pantin’s calculations, provide all
that is necessary to meet present Govern-
mental expenses, including interest, and
leave a margin out of which the State
will make loans for the development of
industry free of interest, 2\ p.c. p.a.
extinguishing the debt in 40 years. It
will also, coincidently, issue bonds whose
interest will be varied in ratio to a price
index of commodities as a means of
controlling the issue of currency and
stabilising values. In many respects his
diagnosis of present distresses is shrewd
and able, and it is supported by highly-
respected economists and bankers. The
fundamental point at issue is the feasi-
bility of a capital levy, a matter upon
which the Macmillan Committee’s report
of three years ago may be studied with
advantage by those who are impressed
with Mr. Pantin’s views.

WAR PENSIONERS FIRST!
The Premiers’ Plan was adopted on
June 10, 1931. Two State Governments
are still faithful to it: Attorney-General
Menzies regards it as “the sheet-anchor
of Victorian financial reconstruction,”
and Premier Butler claims that “South
Australia has adhered to it to a greater
extent than any other State.” N. S.
Wales is in no position to contest Mr.
Butler’s claim: Mr. Lang, while accept-
ing the Plan, altered it as far as he could,
and Mr. Stevens has introduced modifi-
cations of his own, as also has Mr.
Lyons. Queensland, Westralia and Tas-
mania have returned anti-Plan Govern-
ments, and the new Tasmanian Premier
almost goes into hysterics when he men-
tions the thing.
Under the Plan as drafted by a com-
mittee of economists and Treasury officers
and accepted by the Premiers, interest on
the internal Government debt, amount-
ing to just on £588,000,000, was reduced
224 p.c. Holders of securities amount-
ing to £16,655,000 objected, and in cases
where no notification had been received
£31,081,900 was “converted automatic-
ally.”
The objectors didn’t know when they
were well off. Not only was their capi-
tal safeguarded, but their interest, already
for the most part free of State income
tax, was exempted altogether from that
impost, from the special Commonwealth
tax on property income (it has been 10 p.c.,
74 p.c. and 6 p.c.) and “from any addi-
tional taxation imposed on income from
interest.” Thus on net income of £3OO,
as Earle Page points out, they pay £2
11s. Bd., whereas the investor in mort-
gages pays £l9 14s. Id.; on £4OO of
bond interest and mortgage interest the
taxes are £6 18s. 4d. and £39 os. Id.;
on £5OO, they are £l2 4s. 4d. and £6O
15s. 3d.; on £l5OO, £l2B Is. 7d. and £365
10s. Bd.; on £5OOO, £1134 os. Ild. and
£2416 10s. 6d. As a result, moneyed
people turn from rural and industrial
investments and give £lO9 and £llO for
Commonwealth bonds which just after
the conversion were quoted at £BO.
Government wages and salaries, “with
reductions already effected,” were to have
been cut 20 p.c. This was done in some
cases but not in all. In three States, at
least, concessions were immediately
made to those in the £2OO-£3OO class,
and in the Commonwealth and N. S.
Wales cost-of-living “adjustments” have
been suspended. And last year, after
midnight manoeuvres, the salaries of
Commonwealth members were increased
£75 p.a., and the salaries of Ministers
£l5O p.a., nor were the Commonwealth,
Westralian and Queensland Government
employees forgotten. And they all got
the benefit of the reductions in Com-
monwealth taxes, and Commonwealth
and State Government employees in
N. S. Wales shared in the remissions
made by the Stevens Government. That
Government, out of its huge deficit, is
now distributing £400,000 p.a. among
N.S.W. public servants (“one-fifth of the
cut imposed on them”), and the Tas-
manian Government is committed to
“restoration of annual increments and of
half the amount of the total deductions
annually made.”
Pensioners, as well as bondholders and
Government employees, came under the
Plan. Old-age and invalid pensions were
reduced 124 p.c. The war-pensions re-
duction was fixed at 20 p.c. It wasn't
applied to the disabled Digger, but other
groups of war pensioners caught it hot,
especially “dependants.” The cut in
their case was 224 p.c., though it has
been 124 p.c. since November, 1933.
At the end of June, 1933, there were
269,810 war pensioners, of whom 75,244
were incapacitated members of the
forces, 164,268 dependants of such, and
30,298 dependants of deceased members
of the forces. The average weekly rate
of pension was a trifle over 9s. 9d. ; ex-
penditure for the year, exclusive of cost
of administration, was £6,860,500. At
the end of June, 1932 (details for
1933 are lacking), old-age and invalid
pensioners numbered 255,609, and, ex-
clusive of cost of administration, they
received £10,978,600. The total includes
allowances to inmates of asylums and
hospitals, and, these included, the aver-
age pension was 16s. 74d. a week.
It was thought that the proceeds of Com-
monwealth income tax would be reserved
for the soldiers and seamen. The tax
was imposed for the first time when they
were fighting on Gallipoli and in the
Dardanelles and repatriation was begin-
ning. Though it has gone as high as
9s. 6d. in the £, it has barely sufficed for
old-age and invalid pensions ; in some
years there has been a balance on the
wrong side.
It seems clear that war pensioners have
fared worse under the Premiers’ Plan
than any other section. Yet, unlike other
sections, they have not banded together
to protest or intimidate. They have never
been heard to squeal or to issue a threat.
After providing £1,791,000 of the
bounty to wheatgrowers not yielded by
the flour tax, the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment has a surplus of £1,301,600.
Judging by the propaganda in news-
papers and public halls, organised
Commonwealth Government employees
and pensioners want the lot. While
there are, no doubt, anomalies that
should be rectified (there always are
in these cases) the men who fought
for Australia and the families of
those who died for it have a greater
claim. War pensioners first; then
veterans in necessitous circumstances not
provided for under the Repatriation Act
(there are many about, but only £978
7s. 3d. was spent by Repat. in helping
them last year); next, the unhappy buyers
of overcapitalised war-service homes,
and, lastly, the soldiers on the permanent
staff (nearly all Diggers, of course) who
saved the army when a “Labor” Govern-
ment struck a deadly blow at it in 1930.
It is the custom to reward civilians ren-
dering special services in their depart-
ments, and these men, who have no
organisation, did wonders, warrant
officers especially. The only recognition
they got was to be put off for eight
weeks in the year while the Defence
clerks were kept on.
SLAYERS OF DEMOCRACY.
W. M. Hughes agrees with “my old
friend J. H. Thomas, who once said that
‘democracy would be all right if it were
not for the democrats.’ ” “Politicians”
would have been a better word. Every
day in every way and in every free
country politicians are doing something
to make their part of the world safer for
autocracy. Perhaps a Fascist autocracy ;
perhaps one imposed by a foreign con-
queror.
In Australia politicians have almost
killed the Defence forces. “Away with
the superstition that the safety of the
State is the supreme law! The money re-
quired for making that old-fashioned idea
effective is wanted for bounties, endow-
ments, grants to clamorous provinces
and sections, the ‘higher education’ and
other vote-buying schemes!” This wasn’t
stated, but it has been practised. Blarney,
the A.I.F. general, who succeeded
Brudenell White as Monash’s chief of
staff, commands a Victorian division of
the new volunteer army. He announces
that it is at “considerably less than half
its war-time strength,” and that if a
mobilisation order were issued half the
soldiers would be pronounced unfit for
service. A South Australian officer, sup-
porting Blarney, questions whether “there
is an infantry or a light-horse unit in
Australia which could take the field at
anything like its war-time strength.”
The strongest infantry battalion in S.A.
has fewer than 300 men; the war estab-
lishment is 831. The four batteries of
field artillery have fewer than 370 men;
at war establishment they should total 701.
The strongest light-horse regiment has about
225 members; 656 would be required on
mobilisation.
This has come to pass, for the most
part, under anti-Labor government; the
alternatives offered by Labor are further
disarmament and bigger doles.
In the U.S.A. a Democratic Congress
went over the President’s head and added
228 million dollars in bonuses to war
veterans, making a total of 7000 million
dollars. Few of the “veterans” saw ser-
vice, but they all have votes. The Demo-
cratic Government is paying 1000
million dollars p.a. to those who have
curtailed their wheat and cotton crops,
and 2600 million dollars p.a. in doles.
In England a Conservative Govern-
ment has reduced unemployment and
balanced its Budget. It is looking for
support in the provinces for a scheme
designed to revive British agriculture
at the expense of the Dominions, which
have never been popular with the farm-
ing classes in the U.K. But it is being out-
bidden in the vote-market. Labor “intel-
lectuals” like Sir Stafford Cripps and Sir
Charles Trevelyan have formulated a
policy which includes:
Raising unemployment benefits to £2 per
week.
Reducing working hours to 40 per week.
Pensions at 60 at a minimum ot' £1 per
week.
The money is to be raised chiefly
by “increasing the death duties, income
tax and surtaxes.” At a later stage
the mines and principal industries
(iron and steel, shipbuilding, textiles and
all transport services) are to be taken
over by the Government “without com-
pensation... .though income allowances
will be paid to the former owners for a
fixed term.”
France, for a variety of reasons, is in
a worse plight than any of the free
nations. Its politicians for generations
have been more corrupt even than those
of the U.S.A. They have been involved
in all the most sensational scandals and
swindles since the institution of the Third
Republic. Private corruption apart, they
have bought votes to the best of their
ability, like Parliamentary representatives
in other democratic countries. One of
the bids for favor made by almost every
Administration except the save-the-franc
one formed by Poincare in 1926 has been
to leave income taxes uncollected. This
has proved a disastrous boomerang. It
is one of the reasons why the present
“Government of National Safety” has
had to make further cuts in soldiers’ pen-
sions and in the miserable pay of the
civil servants. Such cuts are not good
democracy as a politician understands
it; but what can be done when the
money isn’t there?
Meanwhile unemployment is increasing,
and the tourists who at this time of year
usually spend huge sums in Paris and the
French seaside and provincial towns are
staying away. They have been advised
to stay away by their Governments.
France is the only front-rank country
except Russia that regularly returns a
Communist party to its Parliament,
and Paris is the only city in West-
ern Europe with a “Red Belt.” France
also has more parties than any
other country. The Democrats and
members of the Republican Democratic
Left, the Radicals and Radical Social-
ists, the Socialists and the Communists
all hate one another ; and then there are
the Monarchists and the growing Fascist
party. No wonder French Governments
change often and are always weak!
The position of all the democracies
resembles, in a greater or less degree, that
of the great nations of the past shortly
before they fell. Pacifism and disarma-
ment are fashionable ; it is held that no
one should have to work if he
prefers to be supported by the Gov-
ernment ; the cities are filling up at
the expense of the country; sport is
the chief topic of conversation, and
amusement-places are booming. The
tyrannies correspond to the old-time
barbarian tribes. They are united inter-
nally by a common ambition. Autocrats
like Stalin and Hitler don’t pretend to be
out to give their subjects a good time.
Their chief aim is to make the people
work and arm so that they may be
able, eventually, to grab the possessions
of richer nations, nations which, to a
large extent, have given up working and
have disbanded or diminished their
fighting forces. It is the oldest trick in
history, and the only one by which war
has ever been made to pay.
There was a time when the free
nations could easily be persuaded to
make the same sacrifices for national
security as Russians and Germans are
being forced to make for national aggran-
disement. Democratic politicians have
changed all that. But the spirit of sacri-
fice will have to be regained if the free
nations are to remain free —if they are
not to pass under foreign dominion or
surrender to dictatorships of the Right or
the Left, and incidentally witness at first
hand such scenes of savagery as the Ger-
man people witnessed when their con-
querors quarrelled.
CHAIN STORES.
[This subject continues to engage attention.
Within the last few days an important branch
of the Victorian C.P. has come out against
chain stores, being very properly concerned
for the country storekeeper; and Sydney trade-
unions have issued a proposal for a boycott.
The Bulletin has no use for boycotts. It
would prefer the setting of limits to the exten-
sion of the business and the engagement of
juvenile labor. Meanwhile the controversialists
will not be suppressed.]
As a more or less successful retailer,
with 15 years’ previous experience as
branch manager, 1 know something of
the pros and cons of this question.
“Tock-Tock’s” eulogy of chain stores
(B. 27/6/’34) leaves me cold.
His comparison of variety chains in
Australia with the co-op. stores in Britain
is ridiculous. The co-ops. carry huge
stocks, employ competent adult assistants
and give much the same service as de-
partmental stores in Australia. The
chains objected to here carry only cheap,
quick-selling lines that require no ability
to sell, employ mostly unskilled female
labor and, generally speaking, give the
minimum of service.
“Tock-Tock’s” defence is based on
three main grounds: (1) Chain stores en-
courage the small manufacturer; (2)
they treat their employees well ; (3) they
reduce prices to the consumer by greater
efficiency. As to the first, he overreaches
himself by quoting a chain which sup-
plies tools and dies. Is a man unable
to find plant of this description
worth calling a manufacturer? Is he
likely to observe decent working con-
ditions? Is it not a fair inference that
the goods cannot be supplied by manu-
facturers worthy the name at the price
demanded?
With regard to (2), no one doubts that
award rates and conditions are observed
by chain stores themselves, whatever
may be the case with suppliers ; but so
are they observed by every other retail
store. I commend to “Tock-Tock’s”
notice the chairman’s address to the
shareholders in one of the largest variety
chains. He stated that the concern
employed over 2500 hands and paid
£220,000 a year in wages. Sounds big
at first, but what did the employees aver-
age? Work it out for yourself as near
as you can. Further, what is to become
of girls due for the sack? They learn
no more than an average child
leaving school could be taught in a few
days. Department stores do teach their
juniors the elements of sales service, and
enable them to better themselves if the
opportunity offers.
As to the third claim of lower prices,
some lines are doubtless cheaper, but to
the trained eye they are astonishingly
few. In any case, published figures show
that chains don’t cut with their own
money. A Bulletin digest of the balance
sheet of a chain showed gross profit to
be slightly over 25 p.c. of turnover.
I should be more than satisfied with that
rate in my own business, and I venture
to say that most storekeepers would be
the same. I know nothing of the talc
mentioned by “Tock-Tock,” but I have
dozens of lines on hand which have
dropped as much in price, and which are
not handled by chains —nor are they
likely to be.
Summing up, I maintain that chain
stores are no good to the manufacturer,
because he has to cut his price to the
bone and, without an express under-
taking, can never be sure of repeat
orders. To lay in plant and material in
the expectation of continued orders and
to be turned down at a moment’s notice
might mean stark ruin. It would astonish
“Tock-Tock” to learn the number of
travellers who open their interview by
stating “We don’t supply chains.”
And chains are not much good to assist-
ants, since they produce unskilled labor ;
and they are of doubtful advantage to
the public, their service being inferior
to that of the ordinary store. As fol-
lower prices, these are taken into con-
sideration —in N. S. Wales, at all events —
when the basic wage is being fixed, so
what the public gains on the swings it
loses on the roundabouts.
One thing more: if these people crowd
out the older style of store, where would
“Tock-Tock” and other supporters get
outsizes or heavy goods? Can he see
himself buying a chair or a lino, square
at a chain, or even a sheet of glass or
a pair of boots? These are all more
essential than talc.
The remedy is admittedly difficult to
suggest. A turnover tax would equalise
matters a bit. Failing legislative action,
storekeepers should protect themselves by
avoiding firms that allow big discounts
on large quantities and favor those that
endeavor to preserve a reasonable margin.
BRASS TACKS.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Where the Danger Lies.
Arrangements for the Martin by-elec-
tion have been cancelled, and there are
to be elections for both Houses on Sep-
tember 15. U.A.P. newspapers are
already prophesying victories in every
State. Their party will be very unwise
if it lets this cocksureness color its nego-
tiations with the Agrarians and its work
in the constituencies. It should not for-
get what happened in 1922, and neither
should the C.P.
At the 1922 general election, Nats,
and Cockies were divided. Labor,
though badly beaten for House of Reps,
seats (it got only 29 out of 75),
was strikingly successful in contests for
the Senate. It elected three Senators in
Victoria, three in South Australia —the
lot in each case —two in N. S. Wales,
two in W.A. and one in Tasmania; and
it would have sent two more from the
Speck if it had run a ticket. With singu-
lar fatuousness, the party managers let
J. E. Ogden stand alone, his supporters
being thus compelled to give their second
and third votes to opponents. And they
didn’t concentrate on particular oppo-
nents.
If Labor-socialism can carry the same
five States this time and add three Queens-
land seats to the three it won in 1931,
and is thus sure of till 1938, it will
be supreme in the Senate. That is the chief
danger that threatens the U.A.P. and the
C.P., and that is why it is necessary for
them in States where the Agrarians are
organised to have a cordial understand-
ing. As far as the House of Reps, is
concerned, an exchange of preferences is
sufficient. There should be no sacrifice
of the rights of constituencies to choose
the men they want. But it will avail both
parties little to gain the House of Reps,
and find themselves at the mercy of a
Labor majority in the Senate.
Of course, it would be possible for
the U.A.P. or a composite Government,
after a barren session or two, to secure
a double dissolution. But the one ex-
perience of the kind is not encouraging.
Joe Cook resorted to the expedient in
1914, with the result that Labor came
back with 31 of the 36 seats in the
Senate, electing full teams in Victoria,
Queensland and W.A. And it would
have won 32 for a certainty if Gregor
McGregor, the first man on its S.A.
ticket, had not died after nomination-
day. Thus there were only five Labor
candidates, who got in by enormous
majorities; the sixth seat went to the
Liberal (Shannon) added to their ticket.
As was shown when the Scullidores
were careering round, the Senate can be
a power for good. But it can also be a
power for mischief, and Senators like Mr.
Dunn and Mr. Rae would have merry
sport with a Government reduced to in-
significance in the Second Chamber.
They could wreck its plans and shorten
its days, Australia needs a Government
that will last for another three years at
least, and rule without violent interrup-
tion of the progress towards recovery.
Preferably a Government composed of
the best men in the two parties standing
for freedom of exports and reduction of
taxes and against political control of
banking and currency.

Freedom for Killers.
At the inquest on the bodies of the five
O’Briens, of Richmond, Dr. Jones, the
Victorian Director of Mental Hygiene,
came in for rough criticism.
Francis O’Brien killed his wife and
was found not guilty on the ground of
insanity. Committed to an asylum, he
was, after rather less than three years,
pronounced sane and restored to liberty,
conditionally on his reporting periodi-
cally. He observed the condition for a
time; then he ignored it, and was not called
to account. Passing out of the depart-
ment’s ken, he married again, the woman
having herself been a mental patient;
and three children were born of the mar-
riage. The family fell on evil days; the
man, in another fit of homicidal mania,
cut the throats of his wife and children
and his own.
In bringing in the only possible verdict,
the Acting-Coroner referred to what he
called the director’s “relaxation of a
sense of responsibility,” describing it as
“unfortunate”. and “disquieting.” He
added the opinion that, where a killer
has been found not guilty on the ground
of insanity, “ample precautions should
be taken to guard against any possible
repetition of his act.” But who is
to take them? Obviously sufficient pro-
tection is not to be obtained by placing
the whole responsibility on asylum
superintendents, nor is anything much
to be gained by blaming them when
things go wrong.
The O’Brien case, and that of Mollor
in Westralia, really call for amendments
of the criminal law. The Westralian
Government is holding Mollor, who
killed his son in a frenzy after having
been rejected by a woman; but it is by
no means certain that he can be kept
in custody if his friends produce evidence
that he has got over the “unsoundness
of mind” mentioned in the verdict, which
contained no recommendation that he
should be consigned to an asylum.
Nowadays juries are apt to be swayed
by moving-picture sentiment. To be on
the safe side, “not guilty on the ground
of insanity” should be withdrawn from
the list of permissible verdicts in murder
cases. Justice would be done to the
killer, and protection would be afforded
to the public, if the future O’Brien or
Mollor were found guilty of “murder,
with a recommendation to mercy, based
on the medical evidence as to accused’s
state of mind.” The rest might safely be
left to the Judge and the Executive Coun-
cil. And it would do no harm, even if it
mightn’t do much good, if the marriage
laws were tightened up where lunatics or
ex-lunatics are concerned.

Germania, Unlimited.
“Feng-shui” : “Tacitus”—whom, pos-
sibly without justification, I visualise as
a dear old German gentleman with long
whiskers, a bald head and a meerschaum,
playing scat over a pot of lager, such as
was made familiar to me in my youth,
when Germany’s demands for a place in
the sun had the support of sentimental
English Liberals—puts the conventional
case for the Nazi claim for colonies
(B. 27/6/’34). It fills me (not quite up
to the top) with indifference.
Virile nations, he says, need colonies,
and Germany needs them just as much
as other nations, and far-seeing states-
men (unnamed) recognise her claim for
justice. Switzerland, Sweden, Norway
and Denmark are just as virile as Ger-
many. Their need of colonies has
never received the least consideration.
There is no case on record where nations
owning colonies have got together and
considered the proposition of cutting
up the melon and redistributing the
pieces to outsiders.
It may be difficult to convince “Taci-
tus,” whose mind is in the stage-coach
period of development, that Germany
is struggling with forces so gigantic that
the twopenny-halfpenny Imperialism of
Bismarck resurrected by the Nazis
looks like an attempt to spit in the face
of a 90-mile-an-hour hurricane. When
I was last in his country, Germany was a
vast workshop, teeming with artisans and
agriculturists, who had been equipped by
their scientists and engineering geniuses
with tools capable of supplying the entire
population and a population twice as
large again with everything they needed,
plus a surplus which could be exchanged
for the products of other countries
and other countries’ colonies. Instead
of availing themselves of these tools,
the Nazis, probably the most foolish
party known to history, preferred to be-
lieve that they ruled a poverty-stricken
country which was being kept poor by
the wicked machinations of selfish neigh-
bors.
One leading Nazi recently remarked
that Germany would soon have a
surplus of ten million people which she
would have to get rid of, either by assas-
sination or by making war on somebody.
In order to prepare their people for this
solution and to make them forget their
sufferings, the Nazis started a campaign
which for absurdity and mendacity
beggars description. The Germans appar-
ently believed it. They apparently still
believe it, but while the mind accepts
one thing the belly is apt to believe
another. The conflict between the belly
and the brain has created a state of
national neurosis which has found an
outlet in wish-fulfilment dreams of colo-
nial expansion.
Incidentally, I did not say that Germany
was exceptional in her methods of
shouldering the white man’s burden. I
merely stated that, if General Goering’s
claim that “the natives loved us” was
true, the Hereros picked a queer way of
demonstrating their affection.
Sixty-eight Witnesses.
Murder trials are rare in Maoriland.
The longest in the history of the country
recently came to an end. It lasted 29
days and involved hearing evidence from
68 witnesses.
A remarkable chain of circumstantial
evidence was presented. The man in the
dock was William Alfred Bayly, a dairy-
farmer of Ruawaro (Auckland Province);
the victims were a neighboring farmer,
Samuel Lakey, and his wife. The wife’s
body was found in a pond, and the Court
set out to prove that Bayly drowned her
there. Lakey’s body was not discovered.
Bayly and the Lakeys had had bitter
quarrels. On accused’s farm were found
small portions of incinerated bones, iden-
tified as human, and a lock of hair, iden-
tified as Lakey’s. Parts of a watch that
belonged to Lakey were also discovered.
In a swamp on the property was found
a rifle, and in Bayly’s possession a cart-
ridge which fitted that rifle. There were
bloodstains in his cowshed and evidence
that someone had attempted to remove
them by chipping the wood with a knife.
Experts swore that the marks made by
the knife were such as could only be
made by a knife in Bayly’s possession.
The prosecution placed before the Lower
Court 251, and before the Supreme Court
274, exhibits.
The defence was that the evidence
against Bayly had been planted on his
farm by the real criminal; that it was
impossible that he could have disposed
of any human corpse so thoroughly by
burning, and, alternatively, that there
was no evidence that either Lakey or
his wife had been murdered. Accused
did not give evidence.
Justice Herdman summed up very
briefly, discounting some of the expert
evidence, but ruling against counsel for
the defence, who argued that, where a
body could not be produced, circumstan-
tial evidence could not be accepted. The
jury, after a retirement of little more
than an hour, found Bayly guilty on both
counts, and the death sentence was
pronounced.
One of the large body of police
brought into the Ruawaro district from
Auckland to collect evidence was so im-
pressed with Bayly’s farm that he bought
it a few days after the trial and resigned
from the force. Evidently a man not
afraid of ghosts.

Laws and More Laws.
Dear Bulletin, —Under sections of the
Sydney Corporation Bill which is about
to become law, Bumble will have it all
his own way. The power given to the
City Council to make by-laws deserves an
honored place beside Lang’s Moratorium
Act in the museum of legislative freaks.
Four and a half pages are taken up
entirely with a catalogue of the things
about which the aldermen are to be
given a free hand to legislate. The sub-
jects are enumerated by letters, from (a)
to (xx). It would be curious to know
what stopped the draftsman’s frenzy at
(xx) —whether his imagination grew
weary, or whether a belated scruple pal-
sied his hand before he had twice circled
the alphabet.
An examination of these 50 headings
leaves one sober and chastened. Aider-
men are to have power to make laws
about “the use or occupation of build-
ings when erected or during the course
of erection.” The Supreme Court may
some day tell us whether this means that
the council can make a by-law forbid-
ding any of us to use our offices after
dark.
Another set of by-laws can be
made “authorising the city building sur-
veyor to order the pulling down, opening
or cutting into any work” whenever that
officer “has reason to believe or suspect”
that some other by-law has not been
complied with. Yet another grant of
power extends to “any of the matters
which the city building surveyor is
directed to take into consideration in
respect of any application for approval
to erect a building.” A glance at the
wording shows that a conference of
King’s Counsel would be needed to even
guess what he actually is required to
consider. But it includes such matters as
“skyline,” “general appearance” and,
best of all, “the amenities of any part
of the city.” No doubt'a forest of by-
laws will spring up around these vague
but delightful subjects.
The whole string of powers is intro-
duced with a flourish:
The council may make by-laws for
and relating to the following matters and
subjects, or matters and subjects incidental
thereto.
These last words open up a field of law-
making romantic enough to warm the
heart of any seasoned alderman. The
question of what subjects are “incidental”
to “the amenities of the city” is a philo-
sophic gem.
So the network of laws closes in. It
grows harder every day to keep out of
the police courts. —Yours etc., Frank
Louat.

Federal Labor and Defence.
From John A. McCallum, Federal Labor
candidate for Martin (N.S.W.): —
Your article “Pacifiism in Martin” (B.
4/7/’34) is not quite just to me or my party.
I am not an academic pacifist. I am prepared
to exhaust every means of averting war. I
shall cling to the League of Nations so long
as it has a scintilla of prestige or a shred
of influence. I shall give my support to
bilateral or unilateral treaties or any other
contrivance which will prevent my son from
seeing the horrors I have seen. But I have a
realistic grasp of the present world situation.
The warmongers are on top and we must be
prepared to face them.
The only ground for attacking the Australian
Labor party (I take no responsibility for the
vagaries of the Lang party) on the score of
Defence is its opposition to compulsory train-
ing. That compulsory service would be neces-
sary if the Commonwealth were invaded is
beyond dispute. But compulsory training is
in a different category. I have had experience
of both compulsory and voluntary systems.
The compulsory system dilutes patriotism
and decency with meek acquiescence and re-
calcitrant stubbornness. The resultant com-
pound is mediocre. The voluntary system
evokes patriotism, decency and initiative.
The A.I.F. consisted of those who had served
in the pre-war volunteer forces, those who
had served in the compulsory militia and those
who had had no military training of any de-
scription. It would be hard to distinguish
between the Diggers from these three groups.
But many of the best were men without any
previous training, those who reached the high-
est distinction were commonly men who had
been volunteers before the war, and the
trainees who did well were usually men who
would have volunteered if they had not been
“pressed.”
I. do not think that a traditional Defence
policy will provide adequately for the safety
of Australia. Someone has said “The military
mind always expects the next war to be like
the last one—and it never is.” The develop-
ment of aviation, of heavy steel industries and
of scientific research is more important than
the training of armies.
Finally, though I shall never support a
policy of disarming while other people arm,
I do not think it my duty to talk much
about military matters. Has not a merciful
Providence enjoined a clear separation of func-
tion in these matters? It is appointed unto
some men to go to war, when war occurs,
and unto others to talk about the glory of
war. I do not belong to the second class.

The Indian as “Colonist.”
It isn’t at poker only that passing the
buck is a popular pastime. Years ago
Cape Colony and Natal, especially the
latter, permitted the entry of Indian
coolies—in the case of the Hindus,
casteless and outcasts, since no others
could cross the seas without incurring
everlasting perdition. In a few years
most of these people abandoned the hard
work of cane-cutting and went in for
storekeeping and hawking. They spread
to the Transvaal and Orangia and estab-
lished themselves there, and to the
British East African territories after the
war. Now all the Governments of these
countries would like to get rid of them.
This stiff job has been made stiffer in
South Africa by the fact that 80 per cent,
of Indians in the Union were born there.
A suggested scheme of assisted repatria-
tion to India has been dropped for this
reason, and because economic conditions
in India are very bad. It is now proposed
that the Indian and South African Gov-
ernments should finance a large-scale
land-settlement scheme to be developed
by Indian enterprise. North Borneo, New
Guinea and British Guiana are men-
tioned as suitable places.
North Borneo is held by a British
chartered company. British Guiana is a
Crown colony. Neither of these coun-
tries nor New Guinea seems to have been
asked what it thinks of the scheme, nor
do the African-born Indians appear to
have been consulted. In any case, New
Guinea, as a mandated territory, is out
of the question. Even if the League of
Nations could be persuaded into agree-
ing to such a settlement, Australia would
certainly not allow it.
Another flaw in the scheme is the idea
that these subsidised settlers would
“develop the country.” Australia has a
shocking example close by her doors of
what the ryot becomes once the choice
between toiling on the land and starving
confronts him no more. In Fiji, as
in every other country where the Indian
coolie has been given rope, he turns
quickly from hard work to pursuits
which come naturally to him if given the
chance —petty dealing, usury and a dozen
kindred ways of making money. Fiji
would give a good deal to-day if it could
rid itself of its coolie burden, which it
once took on voluntarily as a help to
economic salvation. '•> :

"AND IT'S PRITNED WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Strict Veg.”: A good story dies hard,
especially if it isn’t true. When Mel-
bourne started to get swelled head over
“Wot’ll yer charge ter mend this one,
lady?”
its centenary and poets and others were
suffering from delirium tremens of the
imagination, artist Denis Connolly sug-
gested the building in the Domain of a
gigantic mound of earth from all over the
world. The proposal was laughed out of
court, The Bulletin pointing out that the
engineering difficulties would involve the
erection of a superstructure larger than
the mound, unless the last bucketfuls
were dropped from aeroplanes. The
yarn has just been presented as solemn
fact to its readers by a Canadian maga-
zine. As it is certain to be copied in
scores of other publications, disappointed
Canadian visitors to Melbourne will
want their money back.
“A.W.U.”: Just now when thousands
of pounds are being spent on aerial sur-
veys for precious metals in Centralia
there should be room for a word about
a woman with the power of detecting
the hidden presence of gold, silver,
copper, oil and water. When the War
Office sends for her to find water for
the troops on Salisbury Plain she must
be the real thing. As diviner for British
Columbia the lady, a Miss Penrose, found
in one droughty area no fewer than 400
springs. The descendant of a line of
water-diviners, she scorns the aid of wire
and forked sticks, merely stretching out
her hands and extending her
fingers. When above hidden
gold her hands wave up and
down 11 times; copper compels
her hands to criss-cross five
times, whilst water produces two
movements. The presence of oil
underground makes her violently
sick. A mining reporter swears
that she could walk over every
“oilfield” in Australia without
losing a meal; but then nearly all mining
reporters are pessimists.

“Chevroford”: Melbourne is the home
of practical jokers whose evil habits
range from starting false fire alarms to
burning down suburban hedges; but
they are not to blame for the case of
the Connells, of Armadale, though it
looked at first like a record in cruel
invention. Up to May 18 the Connells
were living an uneventful life on the
proceeds of the husband’s wage as a
french-polisher. On that day, so the
official story went, a polite stranger called
and said he was acting for a legal firm
in New York, and that Mrs. Connell’s
uncle had died and left her upwards of
£BO,OOO, showing documents to substan-
tiate his story. He advised her to make
immediate preparations to leave by the
Mariposa, advanced her a sum of money,
and told her a solicitor was on his way
to clinch the deal. Connell threw up his
job ; his wife took a trip to Sydney and
bought a lot of clothes. Then things
began to happen. A cable to New York
was returned marked “Address not
known.” No solicitor arrived. The police
began looking for the mysterious
stranger. Finally a pressman obtained a
confession from Mrs. Connell that visitor
and will were her own invention.

“J.C.W.”: Many of the ambulances
presented to the A.I.F. by patriotic
organisations never reached France on
account of their not being standard
makes for service overseas. Most of
these, converted into light lorries by the
simple process of painting out the
Geneva cross, were attached to A.A.S.C.
and A/istralian ordnance units in the
U.K. One, bearing a brass plate inscribed
“Presented by the W.C.T.U.,” was used
by Military Police headquarters at War-
wick-square as a Black Maria. It was
detailed each morning to visit police
stations and collect any erring Diggers
who had been locked up overnight.
“What became of the curate who used to be here?”
“He went to New Guinea to get inside information on cannibal life, and got it.”
“Oran”: New traffic cops in Adelaide,
Melbourne and Sydney are intrigued by
the appearance in the streets of a single-
seater Buick bearing on its number-plate
a white disc beside the lettering “K.W. 1.”
The car, a sports model, belongs to
W. N. MacDonald, of Fossil Downs,
Kimberley West (W.A.), and periodically
travels by road, rail and steamer to
its owner’s home town of Goulburn
(N.S.W.). In Sydney the unusual num-
ber-plate never fails to arouse interested
police inquiry as to whence the oufit
came.

“Bill O’C.”: Is “Old Hand” (B.
27/6/’34) endowed with any ear at alt
that he has “failed to ever yet detect”
in our Australian speech the sound of
the long “i” in place of the long “a”
in words like “wait”? His finding might
have passed unremarked but for his ill-
luck with the human examples he puts
forward as proof that we all (English
and Australians, anyway) speak indis-
linguishably. Leaving the royal family
out of the argument, his specimens who
“talk as we all do” are Lord Burnham,
Ramsay MacDonald and Dion
Boucicault, jun., an amazing
trio of lingual all-alikeness.
Burnham spoke good English
with an ineradicable smooth, oily
accent, the bequest of his ancestors
who climbed from Palestine to the
peerage by way of the Levi-Levisohn-
Levison-Lawson ladder. Ramsay Mac
emits a vocal brand of Lowland
Scottish only producible by an up-
bringing upon porridge and haggis and
absolutely radio-proof. As for Dot
Boucicault, do any old Bulletin readers
remember how this paper guyed his stage
dialogue in his dramatic heyday? “00,
Meeses Tenqueree, ah yo quate shaw,”
etc. This peculiarity seemed to be accen-
tuated when Dot revisited us in his old
age.
“Fitzwilliam”: I have two typists,
part of whose duty is to read over and
check engrossments of documents when
typed. If I happen to catch the context
it is all right, but otherwise I find myself
wondering how I used such words as
“light” and “bight” in the draft of a
document which couldn’t possibly require
them. Then I realise that I wrote “late”
and “bait,” and when the document
comes in find both words correctly spelt.
I noticed a case in the law reports only
last week where counsel had to apply
for leave to substitute the name “Ada”
for “Ida” in a document. I have had
exactly the same trouble. I couldn’t
make out which name the. lady bore,
even after she had spelled it aloud, and
when I had to ask her to write it down
I nearly lost a client.
“A.M.8.”: The absent-mindedness of
people who post letters in pillar-boxes
almost transcends belief. In N. S. Wales
alone during 12 months nearly 40,000
letters and packages were posted without
any address at all, and 471 of them con-
tained money. Thousands more, appar-
ently, were posted to addresses that were
either illegible or unfindable or for some
other reason undeliverable. All these
waifs and strays, of course, find their
way to the dead-letter office, and last
year that institution found itself the
repository of ownerless money and
valuables representing over £60,000.
Most of these letters, when opened, and
many of the packages doubtless fur-
nished a clue to the senders, but there
must be lots which gave little or no
guidance. One wonders if the dead-letter
office’s staff includes a few trained
detectives.

“M.”: “T.Y.1.,” being interested in the
early history of Sydney (B. 27/6/’34),
should note that “Jamieson-street” and
“Jamieson House,” which he mentions,
are wrongly spelled. The street was
named by an early City Council after
Sir John Jamison. Town clerks have
been frequently informed of this error,
but to no purpose; it might well be
corrected, if only for the sake of histori-
cal accuracy.
* * * sH
“Hamer”: For some inexplicable
reason the Sydneyite grumbles more at
cold weather than does the resident of
Melbourne, who has more ground for
complaint. In Sydney the maximum day
temperature has fallen below 50 degrees
on six occasions only in 75 years. Also,
only two nights in every year, taking
the average, does the thermometer fall
below 40 degrees. The averages show the
maximum day temperatures for the 92
days of winter to run to five days under
55 degrees, 34 between that and 60 de-
grees, 36 more under 65 degrees, and 17
over that. The night minimums average
two under 40 degrees, 27 under 45, 42
below 50 degrees; the others are warm
nights. So there is scant justification
for the “B-r-r-r! Bitterly cold, isn’t
it?” which is the orthodox opening
remark in any conversation in Sydney
during the winter.
“1.D.8.”: There was a curious hap-
pening in Sydney the other day when a
£5OO diamond, dropped from a necklace
in a city street, was discovered after a
lapse of some days, during which there
had been a press hue-and-cry in search of
it. A suburban jeweller recognised a
stone taken to him for setting by a young
girl as a valuable one, and identified it
as the lost diamond. The girl’s father,
a motor-driver, had picked the thing up
in the gutter and, thinking it was a crys-
tal bead, had given it to his daughter,
who kept it for some days before going
to the jeweller. One can understand any-
one passing over an uncut diamond, but
it is difficult for one accustomed to cut
stones of quality to imagine how they
could be mistaken for anything else. Still,
ignorance was bliss in this case, for the
finder was handsomely rewarded.
LISTENING-IN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Night after night, and until morn is nigh,
Around the radio we hang by scores
Of thousands, filled with tense expectancy:
Eager to catch, alert to vivify
The very latest news from England's shores.
Our close-knit brows suggest some problem deep
And intricate is robbing us of sleep.
Some world entanglement or nation’s clashes.
Yet, ’tis not. so, my brothers. Any amount
Of things like that we’d hold of small account
Beside the destination of The Ashes.
The freaks of Fascists or the ramps of Reds,
The schemes of chaps whose shirts are brown
or black
Or blue would never keep us from our beds;
Nor yet the path that Mussolini treads,
Or Franklin Roosevelt, or Ramsay Mac.
Let Hitler’s bloody axe fall when and where
It will, our eyes arc fixed on scenes more fair,
Where Bradman’s bat inimitably Hashes,
Where wily Grimmett’s “wrong ’un” twists and
tricks,
And lynx-eyed Oldfield waits behind the sticks;
In short, we’re concentrating on The Ashes.
The moving voice drones on and, ball by ball,
We see the fight incline this way or that;
Before our watching eyes the wickets fall
To lithe O’Reilly or to sturdy Wall.
The warning yell “Go back!” the shrill
“Howzat! ”
They come, or seem to come, for all they’re
worth
Across the breadth of sea, the width of earth.
We sense, in fancy, cuts and snicks and
smashes.
Oh, who is there would amble off to bed
To miss the hourly light that’s being shed
On who will hold or who will grab The
Ashes?
The clock creeps on while on the screen is
thrown
The moving tale of victory or rout;
And some a cheer will stifle, some a groan,
At that quick catch in the announcer’s tone
As he excitably proclaims “He’s out!”
“Stumps,” as their rounds the early milk-ohs
make!
’Tis odds for breakfast you’ll be hard to wake,
And hasty shaving may result in gashes,
While for your job be a bit behind.
But where is the employer fault will find
When the first question in the country’s mind
Is if we’re going to regain The Ashes?
N.S.W.
T. THE R.


“Gastronome”: Commenting on a
recent London craze for reviving old-time
English dishes and meals, a Melbourne
journal sagely asks how moderns would
stand “an Elizabethan meal with boar’s
head, peacock pie, venison, mead, sack
and syllabub.” I should say that the
solids on the menu would go all right,
but I question whether sack was often
drunk at meals in Elizabethan days and
whether the heavy honey-concoction
known as mead was ever served with vic-
tuals. Syllabub is right out of the pic-
ture. It was entirely a drink for country
festivities or garden fetes in the open air.
A recipe I have lays down that it be
made of cream, brandy, wine, spices,
fresh strawberries and cherries and new
milk. It is essential that the milk be
drawn straight from the cow into the syl-
labub bowl. Will anyone seriously argue
that one could eat boar’s head or venison
and wash it down with that concoction?
“Hillmorton”: The flat-brimmed straw
hats which have commended themselves
to the Australian cricketers in England
(B. 4/7/’34) are certainly not difficult to
make and shouldn’t be expensive. Forty
years ago they were the week-day head-
gear of most public schools, winter and
summer alike, probably because they
lent themselves so readily to ribbons,
badges and crests, essential insignia of
school life. At Rugby we were allowed
two a term, at 4s. 6d. a time —a profitable
business for the hatters, for they were
essentially perishable lids. The fashion,
however, was just the opposite to
“I’m positively fed up with Bill. He’s got cold feet.”
“How did you find that out, you brazen thing?”
Harrow, for the common herd were re-
stricted to speckled straws; not until
a boy had the right to consider himself
what was known as “a swell,” either for
athletic or scholastic distinction, did he
blossom out into a white tile. I suspect
they were all made at Luton, the Bed-
fordshire town that has lived on the hat
industry for a century or two.
“Mells”: The story of the man who
was arrested in Perth some 23 years ago
on suspicion of being “Peter the
Painter” (B. 4/7/’34) reminds me that
I have had several alleged criminals
and near-criminals of some distinction
pointed out to me in different parts of
Australia. Most of them, if not all, 1
believe to have been frauds, victims of
their own vanity or the malice of some-
one else. One of them was an ancient
who knocked about Kalgoorlie around
the beginning of this century and who
was persistently identified with “Skin-
the-Goat” (I forget his other name), one
of the men tried for complicity in the
Phoenix Park murders of 1882. Five of
the murderers were hanged a
year later, and Carey, the princi-
pal informer, was followed to
South Africa and unofficially
executed there, his slayer being
subsequently hanged, too. Skin-
the-Goat was acquitted, largely
because of his advanced years,
and if he was alive in Westralia
20 years later he must have been
close on 90. But when a yarn
like that is once started it is
hard to kill it.
“L. 1.8.”: Australian Light Horsemen
owe a debt of gratitude to Mrs. Geoffrey
Brooke, wife of the brig, commanding
the British cavalry in Egypt. For a long
time past she has been running a com-
mittee which gathers in money to buy
as many as possible of the thousands of
Australian mounts which Were sold to
all-comers in Egypt because the preval-
ence of glanders, surra and other deadly
diseases in Egypt and Palestine forbade
their retucn to their native country.
There are still some 500 horses of the
Anzac and Australian Divisions work-
ing in stone quarries and on other heavy
tasks under the tender mercies of the
Gyppo, the cruellest brute to animals on
earth. Whenever there is enough cash to
buy a batch of the worn-out wrecks they
are collected and put out of their misery.
“Scollector”: As a philatelist of 45
years’ standing 1 protest against the lat-
est action of Director of Posts and Tele-
graphs Brown over the new centenary
stamp. In the twopenny edition a defect
occurred in the plate, and one stamp in
every 80 had a line that was faintly
smudged. Did Mr. Brown put his blind
eye to the telescope when this occurred?
He did not. He gave orders that all the
defective stamps should be carefully cut
out and destroyed, and drastic precau-
tions were taken so that not a single
specimen should escape. Thus was a
source of innocent enjoyment for phila-
telists, alive and still unborn, nipped in
the bud, a means of making an honest
profit denied to traders and the world’s
store of entertainment permanently re-
duced. If Mr. Brown had not inter-
vened, philatelists the world over would
some day have been offering anything up
to £5OOO for Mr. Brown’s defective bit
of paper and gum.
“Pawang”: An original method of
collecting medical fees was adopted by
“The new costumes for the chorus, sir!”
a Box Hill (Vic.) midwife. After the
event had been happily concluded she
found her patient reluctant to pay. When
she suggested that the money could
come out of the bonus the mother
said she preferred to spend it on a per-
ambulator. The indignant midwife then
went to the post office, collected the
bonus in the mother’s name and put all
but ten shillings of it in her pocket. The
Court unsympathetically fined her £lO.
“D.”: The killing of General von
Schleicher and his wife by the Nazi
secret police indicates the crazy state of
affairs Germany has got into under its
dictatorships. Charges of perversion
have been flying round. Von Schleicher’s
moral character has never been assailed.
I saw him with Goering in J 928 —a tall,
erect, arrogant, shaven-headed autocrat
who might have served as a portrait of a
war-time Hun. The Swedish journalist
who pointed him out said that he was the
first to tell the German General Staff
that Australians and Maorilanders were
formidable exponents of trench warfare.
“Jorgan”: Maoriland’s toheroa (B.
6/6/’34), the finest shellfish in the
world, is still practically unexploited.
When I was last at Ninety-mile Beach
(in Colonel Allen Bell’s famed “Winter-
less North”) there was one small factory
there engaged in canning operations, but
it was closed down most of the year,
either because the Maoris wouldn't
bother to collect the toheroas or because
of a glut of stocks on hand. Toheroa
soup, made on the spot from the fresh
bivalves and canned right away, would
soon command an overseas market. As
far as I know Ninety-mile Beach and
Dargaville are the only spots in Maori-
land where the toheroa flourishes in
commercial quantities. But there are
plenty of mussels and cockles on our
coasts, and in Europe these are a staple
food. Cockles, as cooked in South Wales
and served with well-buttered mashed
potatoes, make a feed that Taffy never
tires of.
“Feng-Shui”: “Cooroo,” writing from
beyond Foochow, China, corrects, in
some minor particulars (B. 20/6/’34),
my account of our idealistic tours of
the sweat-shops of Singapore. He is
resurrecting a past which is over a quar-
ter of a century dead and his memory
has grown a trifle dim. There was a
Maorilander and he did look like a
policeman. He was my companion on
the occasions when “Cooroo” was other-
wise engaged. “Cooroo” will know who
he was. As to our interfering in some-
body’s else’s garden, Singapore was then,
as it is now, part of the British Empire,
so the unsavory tailoring establishments
I described were not Chinese but British
gardens. I regard it as highly creditable
on our part that we awoke to our re-
sponsibility for these dens of infamy,
even if our awakening was partly due
to Scotch. Anyhow, in lecturing the
world on interfering in other people’s
gardens, “Cooroo” is speaking out of his
turn. As a submarine cable engineer, he
is doing his bit. Modem telegraphic
communications have been a potent
factor in “thrusting ideas on a people
neither ready for them nor capable of
appreciating them.” Still, I don’t quite
see how people can be prepared for or
made to appreciate ideas unless they are
told what they are. I haven’t the slight-
est objection to people thrusting their
ideas on me, provided they don’t hit me
over the head first. The hit-first-and-
convert-afterwards method of gardening
was the sort I was objecting to.
“Tidapa”: Time has no terrors for the
Victorian barmaid. In 1917 legislation
was passed to stop the further employ-
ment of women in bars ; all barmaids
were required to register with the Labor
Department, their licenses to expire im-
mediately they ceased to follow their
occupation. There were 3685 then, and
there are 3668 now. I wonder how they
have managed it.
“Lord Luvus”: Now that the extinc-
tion of the aboriginal race in Victoria is
within measurable distance, as has been
brought vividly to the public mind by
Percy Leason’s gallery of portraits,
there has been an outburst of in-
terest in Binghi. It has taken concrete
form at Healesville, where John Mac-
Farland, of the Melbourne University,
recently unveiled a monument to “King”
Barak, son of one of the “chiefs” who
made the bargain with Batman. Barak,
by all accounts, had something kingly
about him. He earned his title by intellec
tual distinction, having been educated
first by a Moravian missionary and then
by a State schoolmaster named Smith.
He died in 1903 : his merry laugh still
survives in the tenacious memory of
Mrs. Annie Bon, who donated the monu-
ment. Mrs. Bon is 96 and was present
at the unveiling ceremony.
“Emsworth”: There’s a chance that
“Jeviel” (B. 20/6/’34) will hear of some
stratosphere flying during the £lO,OOO
Centenary. Wiley Post, the one-eyed ace,
has been experimenting for months to
perfect an engine that will operate satis-
factorily at a height never vattempted
before, and a flying-suit that will protect
the airman from the bitter cold. The
latter part of the job is done, but, although
Post has produced a suitable engine, he
has to overcome supercharging difficul-
ties to gain the necessary certificate of
airworthiness. If he can solve this prob-
lem, he’ll be able to fly at from 30,000
to 40,000 feet, bringing up his speed from
200 to 300 m.p.h. At that height and
speed he’ll have to rely entirely upon his
instruments, and if they prove faulty he
may find he’s overshot the compulsory
stops or got hopelessly off his course.
THE TEN-TON CAKE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A 10-ton cake, 18 feet high and occupying more
space at its base than a boxing-ring, will be a
feature of Melbourne’s centenary. Six weeks will be
spent in making it.”
It will tower aloft like a war memorial,
The eye to hit and the heart to thrill,
A pleasant blending of art pictorial
With first-class culinary skill.
Twill be mixed in brewery vats, I’m tipping,
And in giant ovens be set to bake,
This all-spectacular, ultra-ripping.
Huge ten-ton Centenary Cake.
What stores of flour and sugar and butter,
Eggs and raisins and lemon-peel
Will go to its making no tongue can utter,
Till hard statistics the truth reveal.
But the notion’s something to win renown with,
Howe'er ’twas hit on, make no mistake!
And I hope there’ll be lots to wash it down
with,
This vast ten-ton Centenary Cake.
The thrilling pageants, the joys diurnal,
The glowing speeches and hullabaloo
Will fill, ’tis certain, no chinks internal
As a record brownie like this should do.
And a Prince will be there from far down under
Into this scran de luxe to break
What sort of knife will he need, I wonder,
To hack a hunk from ten tons of cake!

POLITICAL POINTS
Lyons is going to the country on Sep-
tember 15. Joseph will be without Latham,
who is resigning from the Cabinet and
Kooyong; he will remain Attorney-
General till after the election, but will
do no campaigning. The brainiest mem-
“They’re very comfortable, Joe, I assure
you; and the clothes’ll fit perfectly.”
ber of the Ministry, Latham will be a
dreadful loss to it. How dreadful is
shown by the fact that Parkhill steps into
second place.
December is the customary month for
Commonwealth elections. Hitherto there
has been only one September election
—in 1914, and Labor regards it as a
good omen that it scored large majorities
in both Chambers. But it spoke with
one voice and had a national policy then.
The Nats, pride themselves on the pre-
selection system which they borrowed
from the other side, but they owe some
of their brightest minds to one-man
revolts against it. Latham, for instance.
He entered politics in 1922 by defeating
a “selected” candidate. No doubt there
have been mute, inglorious Lathams who
remained in their callings rather than
fight the machine or compete with party
hacks for the favor of cliques.
The House of Reps, approved of the
redistribution for South Aus., which
means that the Central State will defi-
nitely lose one of its seven members.
But at the instance of Gibson, whose
seat, Corangamite, was to have dis-
appeared, the Victorian plan goes back
to the Commissioners, and the Westralian
plan is also to be returned —because
“Texas” Green doesn’t want any more
cockies in Kalgoorlie. As the election is
only two months off and the rolls are
said to be awful, 10 to 1 there will be
no Vic. or W.A. redistributions.
Nobody with any regard for the future of
Australia likes to see rural electorates go,
but if it is wrong for Victoria to be de-
prived of one it is wrong for S.A. to
suffer the deprivation. Whatever the
blessed Constitution says or doesn’t say,
the House’s way of dealing with the
Angas and Corangamite cases gives one
of the small States another grievance ;
and they have too many already.
Westralian Nats, and Cockies are will-
ing to run Kingsmill, Collett and John-
ston for the Senate, but the secessionists
stormily object to the man who was
president. They threaten that if Kingsmill
is thrust on them they will give him the
last number. Recent election results sug-
gest that they can’t do much to put a
man in or push one out; and their bluff
may be called.
Butler got his 1933-34 deficit down to
£838,000, a reduction of £171,000 on the
1932-33 figures. The estimate was
£1,100,000. Butler regards it as a great
achievement, and he has certainly cut
expenditure to the bone. But it is in-
creasingly clear that, until the Common-
wealth takes over departments—Educa-
tion, for instance —that have grown too
big for the States to handle, South Aus.
will never pay its way.
Queensland Labor informed the Com-
monwealth Bank that it would require
accommodation for 1933-34 to the extent
of £1,848,000, and budgeted for a deficit
of that amount. With great pride it
reports that the actual deficit was
£1,128,500. One encouraging feature is
that railway revenue, declining in other
States, advanced from £5,851,200 to
£6,103,800 ; otherwise the figures merely
furnish evidence that estimates pro-
duced at Premiers’ Conferences are not
to be taken seriously.
Alarmed at the growth of the old-age-
pensions bill, the Government at Can-
berra decided that relatives of ancients
drawing pensions should be asked to
contribute to their support, and put 50
clerks on to get data. After two months
it suffered a rush of ice to the feet, aban-
doned the policy and put off the 50
clerks. In the meantime contributions
from of pensioners amounted
to £6.
Victoria’s Transport Board continues
to disappoint those who hoped it would
approach its task with a bullock-dray
mind. It says it is not going to be dic-
tated to by railway managers, whose
attitude all the world over is never to
relinquish a passenger or a pound of
freight. Neither will it consider “the
irrelevant issue of State ownership” in
the proper distribution of business be-
tween road and rail. As for vans, lorries
and the like, they may go on carrying
passengers on Saturdays, Sundays and
holidays if provision is made for safety.
Vested railway and tramway interests
are still dazed.
The four S. Aus. Labor “parties” have
“united.” The immediate object of the
unity manoeuvres is to present a solid
front for the Commonwealth elections,
but whether the spirit of comradeship will
survive is a matter of conjecture. As the
“So you re burying the hatchet at last,
brother?”
“Yes, but you’d better keep your head
down in case of accidents.”
president of “the Lang party” of one
puts it:
The merger does not mean the sub-
ordinating of the policy upon which the
Lang party built up its forces. Nor does
it mean the continued recognition of Mr.
Scullin as Federal leader.
Nor, if its past history is any guide,
the continued recognition of any leader.
Windfalls from big estates contributed
largely to the British surplus which has
excited so much envy among the Ameri-
cans, and they are still being collected.
The Treasury’s share of Lord Tredegar’s
possessions amounts to £1,180,000. Aus-
tralian Governments never slice up any-
thing as juicy, but they make the most
of their limited opportunities. State Gov-
ernments (mostly N.S.W.) will collect 25
p.c. of the £186,300 left by Jarvie Hood,
the Sydney surgeon, and the Common-
wealth Government will take 15 p.c. of
the balance. Together they will get a
great deal more than any of the benefi-
ciaries—sisters, nieces and nephews.
“From no quarter comes any suggestion that
Mr. Theodore should be a candidate.”
“I took myself to a party,
But nobody asked me to play.”
Five of the six Vic. Labor Ms.H.R.
who lost their seats in the rout of 1931
are after nominations again. The very
unpiraticaldooking Paul Jones is with-
out a rival in Indi, but Dick Keane has
a strong opponent (Pollard, who was
Hogan’s Minister of Agriculture) in
Bendigo. And there are five aspirants
in Batman besides Frank Brennan, Scul-
lin’s Attorney-General, and nine in
Corio as well as Lewis. When Coranga-
mite was thought to be doomed, the in-
exhaustible Crouch came out for Balla-
rat. McNeill, now secretary of the
A.W.U. in N.S.W., is leaving Wannon
to the younger fellows.
Scullin’s banking “policy,” latest edi-
tion, aims at “restoring the management
to a governor.”
The progress made under the late
Denison Miller justifies the restoration of
similar control.
But does it? Nobody underrates Deni-
son Miller’s services to the nation, but
after the war he meddled unhappily in
a matter outside the realm of banking—
Diggers’ homes. Scullin has evidently for-
gotten the matter, but Dr. Maloney could
tell him all about it. This is not the time
or the country for dictatorships, in bank-
ing or any other field.
As soon as it reached office, Queens-
land Labor increased the unemployed-
relief tax. Although the returns show
fewer unemployed, the increased tax is
to stand for another 12 months. One
of the objectors is a Brisbane clergyman,
who has evidently been making a pil-
grimage from one Government relief
work to another, and who describes what
he witnessed as “an insult to manhood.”
I saw a group dressed in long-sleeved
woollens fit to defy the elements on
Kosciusko. Though they were working
with pick and shovel, their polished shoes
remained unsoiled by the small morsels of
clay they had dislodged.
But the “Labor” Government is un-
moved.
Britain and Germany have come to
terms on the foreign exchange question.
Germany is to provide funds at the Bank
of England for payment of interest to
investors in “Young” and “Dawes” loans,
and Britain is to drop all reprisals. No
doubt the Germans were bluffing when
they threatened a trade boycott of Britain
and the Dominions ; but it is best that
these matters should be settled by mutual
arrangement.
Herbert has for years been one of
Queensland’s uncertain Federal seats, as
Theodore can testify. At present it is
held by Labor in the person of George
Martens. The U.A.P.-C.P. crowd says
it can regain Herbert, and is putting up
a strong candidate —Muir, secretary of
the Queensland Canegrowers’ Council.
Only 35 years old, Muir has been all his
life in the N.Q. sugar industry. He had
one try at Parliament when in 1929 he
was a last-minute choice to oppose Mc-
Cormack. He cut the Premier’s majority
from between 2000 and 3000 to 800.
The Melbourne City Council’s traffic
committee, the R.A.C.V., the National
Safety Council, northern suburbs muni-
cipal councils, a host of other bodies
and a large section of the community
have declared themselves against the
Brunswick tramway electrification, but
the Tramways Board isn’t likely to be
impressed. It got its way over the
Coll ins-street change-over, although the
agitation was intense. It is a law unto
itself.
Queenslanders are quite bucked at the
news that there are 18,613 more electors
on the Commonwealth rolls than there
were in 1931. Nothing to make a song
about. In the days of the Caliphs there
were otfen more electors than citizens.
W. M. Hughes has stepped into W. A.
Holman’s shoes as advocate for the mys-
terious State Unity League, which objects
to the division of N. S. Wales. In a
four-hour speech fired at the New States
Commission, he was, it is asserted, “his-
torical, metaphorical, vitriolic and satiri-
cal” by turns. In the only historical allu-
sion preserved he attributed Clive’s
“astonished at my own moderation” to
Hastings and mangled the quotation—
instead of “astonished” he made it
“rather aghast.” The New Staters’
withers remain unwrung.
Ex-Premier Lionel Hill, now A.-G.,
amused a London party gathered to say
good-bye to Forgan-Smith by quoting a
heartfelt complaint from Bruce concern-
"And to think, Granny ‘Herald; he was
our white-haired boy!”
ing Australian delays in answering
London correspondence.
One goes to great trouble to compose
an important communication, and posts it,
after which comes an appalling, deathly,
bloody silence.
Our Greatest Dailies amused newspaper-
men by leaving out the “bloody.”

Professor Anderson (he lectures on
philosophy at Sydney Uni.) is the only
pundit in the Commonwealth who is
redder than the Reds. He complains that
the U.S.S.R. is a nationalist State with a
vast army, and that Stalin is a Jingo. The
professor has transferred his allegiance to
Trotsky, perhaps the only genuine living
internationalist. Trotsky’s international-
ism is so complete that he has been
kicked out of his own nation and France,
refused permission to enter England, and
warned that he will be shot if he is
caught in Germany. This Wandering
Jew is a more or less recent convert to
pacifism; he organised the original Red
Army.
Harry Ell, of Christchurch (M.L.), has
passed out at 72. He represented his
province at Rugby as a lad. Then he
went political, organised the Liberal-
Labor League in Canterbury and got that
part of the South ready to pack in behind
Ballance in the political revolution of
1890. He was in Parliament from 1905 to
1919, and was P.M.G. in the short-lived
Ministry of Tammas Mackenzie. The
last 15 years of his life he devoted to
the Summit-road, which crests the
labyrinthine hills of Banks Peninsula,
and to the conservation of native bush in
the vicinity. He had a house on the
road, and worked there early and late.
Ell doesn’t need a monument. He has
carved one for himself on Banks
Peninsula.
One of the greatest daily-paper editors
Australia has had died in Sydney last
week —Dr. “Whiskers” Ward. He lived to
see all the causes he had battled for so
gallantly and well go down in ruin—free-
trade, State rights, anti-sosh and naval
defence by means of a British squadron.
Between 1903, when he came back to
Sydney “Daily Telegraph” (which he had
left for Melbourne “Age” thirteen years
before), and 1914, when he retired, he
built up about the most interesting poli-
tical paper of its extremist kind in the
Empire. Ward thought he was a Liberal;
actually he was a high Tory. But he was
a good, great and inspiring man, and he
gathered a wonderful staff round him. In
its heyday, round about 1910, the “D.T.”
challenged the “S.M.H.” itself; no in-
telligent “Herald” subscriber could afford
to miss it. Archibald used to say that
nothing saved the “Herald” in the last
resort but its servant-girl advts. —now
superseded by real estate and flat advts.
Dr. Ward was born in M.L. 87 years
ago, fought in the Maori War, and began
his working life as a Wesleyan minister.'
“L. Horse”: A “S. M. Herald” article
on Gostwyck, where the Duke is to stay,
said that the late Major Clive Dangar,
a previous owner, “was badly gassed at
the war.” Absurd! The major, who
before the war had been in the 13th
Hussars, was instructor to the Ist L.H.
Brigade at Heliopolis. Gas was used only
once in the Desert campaign. In April,
T 7, 2000 gas shells were brought to Belah
by the British and put over in the second
Battle of Gaza. The Turks and Germans
laughed at the idea of gas being effective
in Palestine and never even tried it.
When the war began Madame Curie,
the discoverer of radium, who has died
in Paris, was a lone widow. She went
straight to the nearest back-area hos-
pital ; and from then till the end of the
war, with a few short breaks, she served
as a radiographer on all parts of the
Western front. Most of her work con-
sisted in training others, but she attended
almost daily to sufferers herself, and
many Diggers remember her with
gratitude. A pallid, sad, abstracted little
woman, she was nothing like the popular
conception of a genius or of a French-
woman. Clemenceau tried to get her
made a member of the Academy but
failed ; partly, it was said, because she
had been born in Poland, fiut chiefly be-
cause she was a woman.
Family item from “Jeames”:
“Mr. Gus Paul appeared in a dapper new
suit reminiscent of Saville Row.” With this
sentence Sydney “Telegraph” established last
week for Associated Newspapers what is
claimed by lexicographers to be a record —that
of having misspelt Savile Row oftener than
any newspaper company on earth. The West
End street which is synonymous with fashion-
able tailoring in the minds of “Sun” and
“Telegraph” writers (though it has long been
supplanted in this respect by Hanover-street
and Hanover Square) is called after the grand-
father of the first and last Marquis of Hali-
fax, who flourished in the seventeenth century.
Sir Henry Savile was a wealthy Yorkshire
baronet with a London estate; Savile Park,
Halifax, is also called after him. Associated
Newspapers’ habit of misspelling this ancient
English name is another example of the in-
fluence of the talkies. Victor Saville is a film
director, and there are many Savilles in the
U.S.A. —vide “Who’s Who in America.”
Allegorical study by Finey. BRIAN PENTON deflating a politician.
Finey here reveals Brian Penton prick-
ing a political bubble-head —his favorite
pastime. Penton, his wistful eye, frail
form and wind-blown bob have be-
guiled many a platitudinarian of our
ruling classes into vainglorious reminis-
cence. Better for a sensitive legislator
to nurture a serpent than to throw his
weight about in the vicinity of Penton.
Yet scores have done it, and scores of
others are only waiting for the chance.
Penton practised skite-deflation as a
member of the “S. M. Herald” staff for
several sessions; then someone in
authority read one of his articles and
Hunter-street was shaken as by a con-
vulsion of nature. He has since trans-
ferred his barbs, bludgeons and bricks
to the Sydney “Telegraph” armory. His
novel “Landtakers” is being hailed as a
masterpiece by some of the very poli-
ticians he has harried. The book only
came out this month, and it went into a
second edition last week.
Sands and McDougall, Melbourne’s
oldest manufacturing stationers, have
been in the news twice lately. In James
Caffin, who has died aged 93, M.L. lost
its first commercial traveller. He went
there from Melbourne to represent S.
and M. 67 years ago. S. and M. can
also claim associations with San Fran-
cisco’s first Aussie strike-leader. Harry
Bridges was one of their juniors during
the war. He left Port Phillip for the
Golden Gate in 1920 and has been on
’Frisco’s embarcandero ever since. He
ordered the waterside workers’ strike
which has paralysed Pacific Coast ship-
ping, stopped last week’s sanguinary riots,
and at latest advices was trying to start
a general strike.
“Second Divvy”: The maiden speech
of F. P. Kneeshaw, one of the newcomers
to the N. S. Wales Leg. Council, contained
a pregnant item: “As an ex-artilleryman
I say that, within half an hour of an
enemy cruiser opening fire on Sydney,
Bunnerong would be hit.” Kneeshaw
had a battery in Cohen’s Mobile Brigade
and was severely wounded. The most
remarkable thing about him was that he
missed his D.S.O. The D.S.O. was prac-
tically an issue decoration for battery
commanders, and there was no braver or
more efficient officer in the A.F.A. than
this imperturbable young ex-militiaman.
Of course, there were similar mysterious
happenings in nearly all the brigades.
Kneeshaw is an electrical engineer;
hence his interest in Bunnerong power-
house.
David Charleston, was 86 when the
end came the other day. A Cornish
engineer, he settled in S.A. just 50 years
ago. Inside seven years he was in the
Leg. Council, and when Federation came
he was one of the first S.A. batch of
Senators. Charleston had all the solid
virtues; for more than 20 years he was
chairman of finance for Adelaide School
of Mines.
“Nakhoda’s” memory:
I have reason to be grateful to Prince
Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the late con-
sort of Queen Wilhelmina of Holland. He
was the father of Princess Juliana, born April
30, 1909. I was in Java at the time. The event
had been awaited there with intense anxiety;
it was not the first time that expectations had
been dashed to the ground. When the news came
through the stolid Dutch burghers and burgher-
esses of our little fever-stricken coastal town
staged a celebration that made Mafeking look
restrained. It lasted a week, and Britons and
Australians were given free passes to every-
thing. All the ladies started cooking and sent
round portions of their dishes to our mess, and
in the local club the champagne was free. The
explanation is that if Wilhelmina had had no
progeny the succession would have gone to a
German prince. In that case Holland might
not have been able to preserve its neutrality
in. 1914-18. Worse, it might have had to
join Germany, with the consequent loss of
its beloved colonies.
The late W. J; Duggan was about the
most pacifist customer who ever occu-
pied the chair at a Vic. Trades Hall
debate. An explanation is that he was
a noted heavyweight bruiser in the
R.A.N. A plumber by trade, Duggan
organised the affairs of his union and
afterwards rose rapidly through the
Trades Hall hierarchy, to end up as
secretary of the council and president of
the A.C.T.U. Representatives of em-
ployers joined in the regrets at his un-
timely death ; they had a high opinion
of him.
“Lex”: It is late in the day for
Attorney-General Latham to protest
against rumors that he will be made
Federal Chief Justice. The fact is Gavan
Duffy, C.J., shows no present disposition
to step down. Why should he? In the
Commonwealth sphere the absence of
pensions for Judges is balanced by the
absence of a retiring-age; and at 83
G.D. feels as young mentally as ever.
The tip at the Bar is that Latham will
have every opportunity to re-establish
himself there.
Australia will welcome a curiosity
when Brig.-Gen. Royston visits Mel-
bourne for the centenary. “Galloping
Jack,” as the Anzac M.D. knew him,
was an Afrikander who went to Egypt
after serving in South and East Africa.
He was given command of the 12th L.H,
and at Romani commanded the 2nd L.H.
Brigade. He was in charge of the Ist and
2nd Brigades at Bir el Abd and the 3rd
at Magdhaba. Royston liked nothing
better than galloping up and down the
firing line. At Romani he foundered 14
horses in one day. On such occasions
he wasn’t particular whether he was
bossing his own brigade or someone
else’s ; it was the popular old sportsman’s
only fault as a firing-line fighter. He was
nearly 60 when the war began, but Aus-
tralians overseas say he looks as vigorous
as ever.
About a couple of oddities:
C. D. Price (87) and W. B. Pruen (79), who
have died at La Grange Bay, south of Broome,
and at Darwin respectively, resembled char-
acters in an Island film. Price came to W.A.
from India sixty-odd years ago, rose to be
Acting Surveyor-General, and was thanked at
the bar of Parliament for “valuable services to
the colony.” He died a recluse, blind and in
poverty, attended by natives. Pruen also came
from India (he had been an army officer) and,
like Price, he lived on Government rations in
his old age. His only dress for nearly 20 years
had been a pair of shorts, and he was tanned
almost coal-black.
Engineer-Captain P. E. McNeil, whose
promotion to Engineer-Rear-Admiral was
gazetted last week, is the first R.A.N.
“tiffy” to reach flag rank. The late Vice-
Admiral Clarkson and Rear-Admiral
Sydenham also climbed from the engine-
room gratings, but they were R.N. pro-
ducts. Born in Melbourne in 1884,
McNeil learned his work at John Brown’s
Clydebank yards and joined the R.A.N.
in 1911.

The picture has changed completely since
the public put up £250,000 in 8 p.c. cum.
prefs. to help build the State Theatre,
Melbourne, in 1929. The old Union Co.
got £43,800 in fully-paid ords. for its
equity in the freehold, which carried a
blister of £147,500 at March 31, 1930.
It guaranteed both the pref. div. and
capital, took a 25-year lease of the theatre
at £42,000 p.a., and was holding a further
148,495 ords., paid to £116,321, when it
went into liquidation toward the close of
1932. The contribs. were forfeited on
account of unpaid calls, and the £116,321
was used to rub out the p. and l. debit
(£24,052), preliminary exes. (£6833) and
£85,436 of the book value of fixed assets.
That reduced paid capital to its present
figure, £295,305 in 250,000 8 p.c. non-
cum. prefs. and 45,305 ords.
Meanwhile, the prefs. agreed to forego
arrears and make the div. non-cumula-
tive. The theatre was leased first to
Greater Union (Management), Ltd., at
a rental equal to 90 p.c. of the lessees’
profits, and later to Greater Union (of
which the Management Co. was an off-
shoot) for 10 years at £450 a week, with
the right (after allowing the lessee a “rea-
sonable return” for operating the theatre)
to additional rent which will enable the
lessor to pay 4 p.c. p.a. on its pref.
capital.
During the 12 months covered by the
latest accounts the co. collected the mini-
mum rental (£23,400), and doesn’t seem
likely to collect much more for a while.
Including interest on the mortgage
(£6743) and depreciation (£2500), exes,
took £15,287, leaving £Bll3 net, equal
to 3.2 p.c. on the pref. capital. No div.
was paid ; taxation liabilities in connec-
tion with the liquidation of Union
Theatres blocked the way.
For the current term net earnings are
expected to approximate those for the
year to the end of March last, and the
board hopes to pay a div. The market,
therefore, prices the pound prefs. at
11s. 9d. as against Bs. 4d. a year ago.
The return at 11s. 9d. would be 5.2 p.c.
on a 3 p.c. div. basis. The net tangible
cover is 255. Id., practically all in fixed
assets, which netted less than 2 p.c. on
their written-down book value last year.
Freehold, equipment, etc., figured at
£455,113 (unchanged); debtors, £822
(down £113) ; cash and deposits, £6741
(up £4929). The mortgage (£137,500)
was reduced by £2500, the amount com-
ing to sundry creditors (£920) by £7l, and
the tax reserve (£7922) by £3227.

The scrip is mostly owned by half a
dozen co-operative farmers’ organisa-
tions in Vic., S. Aus. and N. S. Wales,
through which the co. gathers the bulk of
its business, the select nature of which
is reflected in the low loss ratio. But
considering the facilities for harvesting
the premiums the expense rate is dis-
appointing, though it is quite probable
that some of this outgo finds its way
into shareholders’ pockets. Since the co.
was formed about 15 years ago, share-
holders have had £111,137 in divs. and
bonuses combined, and at the end of
March last there was £123,203 of re-
serves to assist and protect £95,020 of
capital, of which £15,000 is bonus scrip ;
altogether a splendid performance for
a 15-year-old.
Although slump brought an abrupt
contraction of underwriting results, it
had little effect upon distributions,
thanks to (1) previously wide margins,
and (2) returns from investments. Here
is a comparison of underwriting per-
formances: —

The most encouraging feature there is
the drop of £2 16s. per cent, in last year’s
expense ratio. The shrinkage of £4489
in net premiums was more than offset
by savings of £4957 in exes, alone. Claims
were £2078 lighter, leaving a surplus of
£14,208 as against £11,662, £7621 and
£ll5B back to 1931. Interest and rents
(£8212, equal to 8.6 p.c. on capital) were
only £192 lighter. The net return from
all sources was thus 23.5 p.c. on capital
as against 21.1 p.c. the year before. The
div. was kept at 7 p.c., and an extra
£354 was sent out in bonuses (£7769),
making the total distribution 15.1 p.c. for
the year.
Balance-sheet figures appear to be a
satisfactory lot:

Most of the money that became avail-
able last year was invested in Govern-
ment securities, up £10,806. When the
books closed, policy-holders could see net
tangibles equal to 222 p.c. of the year’s
net premiums—150 p.c. is usually con-
sidered adequate.

When conditions in the trade enable the
board to see more clearly what the co.’s
earning capacity is likely to be, it is pro-
posed to jettison some of the capital.
After a run of 10 p.c. divs. to the close
of accounts in 1924, the factory was
enlarged and modernised, and £75,000
of 8 p.c. pref. money was gathered to
meet the outlay and lighten the over-
draft. It was about this time that Nestle’s
completed their new chocolate factory at
Abbotsford (Sydney), the Cadbury-Fry-
Pascall interests had set up works near
Hobart, and Macßobertson started to ex-
tend his business. Then slump brought
a fresh lot of troubles, and Hoadley’s
losses for the half-dozen years to the
end of 1931 aggregated £62,823 net.
But savings followed an overhaul of
the organisation, more of the business
was put on a cash basis, the financial
position improved, following final settle-
ment (£12,552) for a property sold in
1928, and the trade outlook lost some of
its drabness. Still, the management has
been unable to squeeze much profit out
of the business —£222 in 1932 and £531
last year, when gross earnings sprang
£2320, reaching £25,033, or not much
more than half the 1929 figure. The
amount of capital unrepresented by tan-
gibles at the end of 1933 was £51,262,
or 13s. Bd. per ord. share. That leaves
out of the figuring a reserve of £15,708,
created by writing up the book value of
the property in 1929.
To carry an extra £12,633 of stocks
and £3844 of debtors’ balances, the co.
went to its bankers for an extra £9765
and leant upon sundry creditors for a
further £5678 last year:

The improvement in the more or less
liquid surplus (£32,608, including stocks)
was £lll7. That excludes a contingent
liability to buy 20,000 £1 shares in
Federal Milk Pty. at par from W. Hoad-
ley at his option or death.
At Bs. the fully-paid pound shares
would return 5 p.c. on the basis
of a 2 p.c. div., which would call for
£l5OO. For the much more speculative
ords. 4s. 6d. was recently offered.

There is money in the manufacture of
soft drinks as well as hard stuff. This
little co. set up 24 years ago with a capi-
tal of £38,507, to which £21,393 was
transferred from reserves five years later,
freehold and plant being written up
£11,444 for the purpose. At the same
time the div. was reduced to 7 p.c., but
it was worth more than 10 p.c. used to
be. In 1922 a par issue carried capital
to its present figure, and another run
of 10 p.c. divs. followed. It was inter-
rupted by slump, the rate for the two

The movements in debtors’ balances (up
£16,348 last year) suggest that the co.
has recaptured all the trade it lost early
in the slump, and more than as much
again. Also the board has not spared the
shears when clipping off something for
depreciation.
After making whatever allowances
were considered necessary, last year’s net
earnings were £2608 better at 8.7 p.c. on
capital as against 5.1, 4, 7.1, 14.3, 12.4
and 11.5 p.c. back to 1928. The final
div. was at the rate of 10 p.c. p.a., mak-
ing 8 p.c. for the year.
That the co. has been able to widen
its connections and improve its earnings
in the face of fierce competition makes
the outlook for shareholders encouraging.
The market has lengthened its bid for
the pound shares, visibly covered by 255.
Bd. in net tangibles, from 19s. 6d. to 245.
6d. over the last 12 months. At the
higher figure the return is 6.6 p.c. on an
8 p.c. div. basis.

As the N.Z. Consolidated Dental Co.,
this trader in dentists’ supplies did fairly
well. Divs. were moderate, but share-
holding customers received a bit more in
bonuses. In 1922 the Surgical Supply
Co., Auckland, was taken over, share-
holders put up more to provide funds for
new headquarters and to enlarge stocks,
and the name was changed to the pres-
ent title. But the re-entry of Germany
into active business created trouble with
prices. Divs., which had been steady
at 8 p.c. for the six years preceding
1923, averaged only a wink over 3 p.c.
p.a., for the eight years to the close of
accounts in 1930, with dry patches in
’23, ’27 and ’29. Shareholders, who
were again passed by in ’3l and ’32, got
only 2\ p.c. for each of the last two
years, and that was not earned, accord-
ing to the figures. Indeed, the co. has
made little progress; reserves at last
balance were £3591 lighter than at the
close of accounts in ’22, although they
had meanwhile benefited by £1389 of
share premiums.
Last year gross earnings (£14,824) were
a shade above the previous year’s ; exes.
(£13,897) were practically unaltered, and
the net result (up £111) was 1.6 p.c. on
capital. Reserves were tapped for £519
to pay the div.

There was little change in the more or
less liquid surplus (£33,776, including
stocks).
Turnover began to improve half-way
through the term, and has continued to
do so since. But the market, which
notes the co.’s past performances, prices
the fully-paid pound shares at 7s. or
thereabouts. The return at 7s. is 7.1 p.c.

This co., whose earnings depend mainly
upon Government spending on road and
other public works, operates gravel de-
posits at Emu Plains and a metal quarry
at Prospect, and has done so since the
beginning of this century. Until recently
it always managed to pay a div., though
the rate was irregular and modest until
the scattering of loan money, which
created a strong demand and a good price
for metal, enabled a steady 10 p.c. to
be distributed for the decade to the close
of accounts in 1929.
Then the well from which we used to
draw our overseas loan funds dried up.
This and other things, including the poli-
tical misfortunes of N. S Wales, brought
about paralysis of the construction
trades, and the co. had to cut prices
below cost to secure its share of the
trifle of business offering. Hence the
poor showing and the absence of divs.
over the last four years. During the 12
months covered by the latest accounts a
bit more was spent on roads, etc., and
there was a better demand for gravel
from the building trade, mainly for flat
construction. But competition was so
aggressive that the management was un-
able to squeeze more than £ll7O of
profit (1.2 p.c. on capital) out of the
larger trading.
The market sums up the pros-
pects by paying 14s. for the pound
shares. The return at that figure would
be 5 p.c. on a 34 p.c. div., which would
call for £3191. The cover is 235. 3d. in
net tangibles, mostly quarries and plant,
worth what they can earn ; that excludes
the depreciation reserve (£7BOO, up
£350).

was written off last year.

*Loss. tProfit. tHalf-year’s pref. div.
The table tells the gloomy story of
conditions in the hardware trade. The
public came in about eight years ago
on the strength of a prospectus that
figured net profits at £19,500 p.a. But
estimates got askew from the jump ; even
during the boom small losses alternated
with , slender profits from year to year.
Except for the half ration which the
prefs. got at the start, it has been one
long drought for shareholders, and it is
difficult to say when the spell is likely to
be broken.
Last year the slate was cleaned by can-
celling arrears of pref. divs. and slashing
16s. per share (£42,774) off the ords.
This enabled the intangibles (£38,945) to
be rubbed out and £3829 to be struck
off the book value of stocks. Trade was
a bit better, and a profit of £l4 was
claimed. But if the £3829 written
off stocks was actual depreciation, the
year’s net result was a loss of £3815 ;
if it was not actual depreciation, then
stocks were undervalued by £3829, which
may be reflected in the current year’s
trading result.

Let's talk over your
INDEPENDENCE
TOULDN’T it be better for me to invest my savings
W * n k°nds or shares?” asked a young husband of an
A.M.P. Counsellor.
No, ’ was the answer; “definitely, no! When you are a
member of the A.M.P., the full sum assured is guaranteed to
you, though you may have been a member but a week; your
investment is backed by £93,000,000 worth of assets all care-
fully selected. There is no such guarantee when you buy
shares or land, good as such investments often are. A.M.P.
assurance should be every man’s first investment; it gives him
independence, security, confidence. Moreover, it gives security
to his family.
An example: A certain man had put all his savings into
various share holdings before the depression and, when things
were at their worst, he died. His wife found that more than
half his savings had been lost. Another man who had put all
his savings into A.M.P. policies also died. His wife found that
his savings had been more than quadrupled. The first had
left his wife poorly off; the second, though he died young, left
his wife comfortably off; that is the immense advantage of
A.M.P. assurance over all other investments.
Better ask that an experienced Counsellor be sent to talk over
with you your future independence; or, if you prefer, send
for a copy of “Investing in Happiness,” a book that may open
your eyes to the value of A.M.P. membership.

60oz. of gold over the plates, and an-
other parcel of about six tons returned

London by the Mt. Elliott and New
Consolidated Goldfields group to work
about 25 miles of the Bet Bet deep lead
(Vic.). The working capital of Talbot
Alluvials will be £85,000, and of the
other two £150,000 each. Mt. Elliott has
a 37 p.c. interest in Talbot Alluvials,
which holds 40 p.c. of the capital in the
Madam Hopkins and Homebush cos.
Production is expected to begin in about
three months. Oroville and Camp Bird,
both London-controlled, are also inter-
ested in the Bet Bet main trunk lead.

and 50,000 contribs. respectively. The
co. is to work a property at Wood’s
Point (Vic.), previously under option to
G.M.A., who will manage the venture.
Half a dozen diamond-drill holes have
proved the existence of at least three
floors below No. 8 level; these are to

South Frederick the Great has been

for 470 z. of gold. The formation con-
sists of quartz spurs set in slates in
faulted country cutting across the country
rock. The public has subscribed £20,000
in 10s. shares, called to 25., and the
vendor takes £5OOO in fully-paids.

New Venture’s offshoot, Coolgardie
Brilliant, has a capital of £BO,OOO in 4s.
shares, of which 300,000 were offered
to those on the parent’s register. The
parent itself takes £BOOO cash, 5000 paids
and a further 95,000 credited as paid to
2s. each. The co.’s ground, which in-
cludes the old Brilliant and Richmond
mines and an area south of the Brilliant,
at Coolgardie (W.A.), contains a series
of lodes and a quartz reef. Values of
over 13dwt. are reported in a soft kaolin-
ised lode, 19ft. wide, at 200 ft. The out-
crop has been traced for about 40
chains. The co. plans to treat 10,000
tons of ore a month.

Boulder Perseverance’s 24-acre Golden
Mile block, which has been worked for
nearly 40 years for returns aggregating
over £1,600,000 to shareholders, has
many years’ life ahead of it yet.
Holders of the 10 p.c. notes will continue
to get the best service off the co.’s
golden joint until 1936, when the paper
is due for redemption. Meanwhile a
sinking fund is being built up to meet the
burden, which ord. shareholders have to
carry. Still, Perseverance and its eastern
neighbor, Associated, are but shadows of
what they were in the late ’nineties, when
Horatio Bottomley was chairman of one,
and Frank Gardiner, of the Carrie Swain
comedy co., was head serang of the
other.
* * * $
South Kalgurli’s latest estimate of ore
reserves shows that it is still three years
ahead of the mill. The co. also has a
three-fourths interest in a quartz claim
of good surface appearance near Mt.
Monger, and an option on the old Robin-
son at Kanowna (W.A.). Here 30,0000 z.
of gold was extracted from 45,000 tons of
reef prior to 1908. Values dwindled to
sdwt. a ton at 300 ft., which was unpay-
able in those days, so the operating
London co. packed up and left. The
show is now being tested by diamond
drilling, and if results warrant a co. will
be formed to take over and work it.
The consideration will be a tenth interest
in shares.
Golden Mile Block 45, whose leases
adjoin those of North Kalgurli United
and Paringa Extended, at Kalgoorlie
(W.A.), proposes to make a general sur-
vey, including an examination of the
geological structures of its holdings, and
to test the lodes at depth by diamond
drilling. In the past work had been con-
fined to the oxidised zone, the deepest
shaft being 280 ft. Hopes are that the
32dwt. stone disclosed in Paringa Ex-
tended continues into Block 45’s ground.

Yarri Gold Mines, which has quietly
abandoned its option over a property
near Yarri (W.A.), has transferred its
attention to Burbanks, south of Cool-
gardie. Here it has taken a 12 months’
working option over 24 acres north of
the Ora Banda North property. The
terms are £lOO deposit and £lOOO before
June, 1935. The vendors also have the
option over 20,000 shares at 6d., plus any
calls made during the option period.

Under Charlie Harris’s management,
little Princess Royal (W.A.) showed a
net profit of nearly £16,000 last year.
Two divs. of 6d. each were paid, and
another 6d. was sent out the other day.
There is still a bit of stuff to take out,
and by the time it is extracted the co.
hopes to have acquired a new mine.
* * * *
Austral, a small Adelaide co. with
good connections but little cash and call-
ing power, has taken another Westralian
option ; this time at the southern end of
the Kalgoorlie field. Its first option was
at Patricia in 1930, and the second was
the old Associated Northern block on
the Golden Mile. Both were abandoned.

“Old Warden”: The Russian Soviet
claims that its gold output for 1933 beats
that of Canada and the U.S.A. com-
bined, and will soon equal that of the
Rand. The mines and a lot of the
machinery were acquired by confisca-
tion. So, with no royalties to pay, with
development work mostly well advanced
before the seizure, with machinery and
general equipment of the best known to
Britain and the States, and with cheap
labor, overhead should not worry the
autocratic Government owners much. It
is true that in one group, the Lena, the
original owners managed to get the
Soviet before a general Arbitration
Court in Berlin, with a German expert
as chairman. The Court awarded the
complainants 12 million pounds damages,
but the Soviet just faded out of court,
leaving them to collect as best they
could. So far they have had no luck.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
(1) Will sdwt. per ton pay ? (2) Lowest
amount of gold per ton payable ? (3) Lowest
cost of working plant ? —2024.
(1) and (2) Depends upon the size and nature
of the deposit; sdwt. stuff might pay in a
well-organised and -equipped mine. (3) Can-
not say; among other things, local conditions
and tonnage of ore to be treated need to be
taken into consideration.

SHADOW SHOWS.
“Twentieth Century”
A gorgeous skit on temperamentalism
by John Barrymore and Carole Lom-
bard. The stage assumes that only artists
are egomaniacal, but, of course, the
trouble is manifested in every walk of
life. An illiterate old war-time base-
wallah supplied the classic case in the
present critic’s experience. The old war-
rior behaved in his orderly-room and on
parade exactly as Barrymore does as a
stage producer in “Twentieth Century.”
Carole Lombard, whom Barrymore
transforms fronji a dowdy half-wit into
a world-famous exotic, is also an every-
day type; she is any underbred and
brainless lass who has married money.
Carole bolts to Hollywood at the
height of her fame, and takes up with
a film hero. Barrymore pursues dis-
tractedly on a train, and gives a series
of burlesques of the kind of acting that
went down with the critics before the
talkies came in. The lady, who is on
the train with her lover, supplies equally
clever burlesques of the art of a movie
star. Walter Connolly, Roscoe Kearns,
a mercurial little man in the tradition of
the polite lunatic of “The Belle of New
York,” and a couple of profusely-
bearded Oberammergau principals get the
rest of the laughs. It is to be‘seen at the
Liberty.
“Fashion Gaieties of 1934”
William Powell has here the kind of
part he plays best—a fluent confidence
man with the imperturbable manner and
dapper appearance of a good shop-
walker. Aided by Bette Davis and Frank
McHugh, he rises from insolvency to
the ownership of a New York concern
which flourishes by stealing designs for
Paris models. The three go to Paris, and
carry on the swindle there, assisted by
Verree Teasdale, whom the local King
of Fashion worships.
The plot and dialogue are. idiotic, but
the film is marvellous as a spectacle. It
might be described as a fashion display
to end fashion displays. Until the writer
saw it he didn’t believe that movie-
ballets could get any nakeder; yet here
we have the seemingly impossible accom-
plished. The young women, who are
beefy in the new mode, gyrate in girdles
and brassieres made of ostrich-feathers.
“A Cuckoo in the Nest”
In this screen edition of Ben Travers’s
farce, at Melbourne Mayfair, Walls
spends most of the evening locking him-
self in bathrooms to escape the gimlet
eyes of his wife while drinking port, and
he makes the pathetic old soak a human
character, in between spots, so to
speak. Ralph Lynn’s teeth and silly-ass
comedy are placed at the disposal of
Peter Wyckham, who loses his wife on
their honeymoon, and spends the night
at an inn with another man’s spouse,
with comic but not immoral conse-
quences. Yvonne Arnaud, Mary Brough
and Robertson Hare are familiar recur-
ring decimals in the cast. Although the
Lynn-Walls methods begin to wear a
trifle thin and the proceedings are far
too prolonged, there are elements of
freshness in the piece.
“Early to Bed”
The screen story of the girl who works
in the daytime and sleeps at night and
the young man who sleeps in the day-
time and works at night, both occupying
the same bed at different times, has
already been told with an American cast.
This one has allegedly German prin-
cipals. The usual misunderstandings
occur, and there is the usual clearing up,
with the customary happy consequences.
There is an engaging scene in a night
club, where the waiter-hero dissolves the
pangs of jealousy in drink. The per-
formers include Lady Tree, Heather
Angel, Donald Calthrop, Athene Seyler,
Leslie Perrina, Fernand Gravey, Sonnie
Hale and Edmund Gwenn.
“It Happened One Night”
An American producer introduced a
Melb. Plaza audience on Saturday to the
spectacle of a bridegroom arriving at
his wedding in an autogyro and of a
love affair trailing itself half across the
States in an enormous night ’bus whose
like has not yet been seen in this land.
Thrown in for full measure are the tech-
nique of modern American stunt journal-
ism and the more or less plausible
behavior of a millionaire whose hunt for
an absconding daughter becomes a
nation-wide hue and cry.
Claudette Colbert is the heiress who,
at the instigation of her father, bolts into
Clark Gable’s arms from under the
parson’s nose. As old-fashioned as a

rock); (bottom) lan Hunter, Jessie Mathews and Fred Kerr in “The Man
from Toronto.” The object on the table is a jelly.
“Family Herald” novelette, yet as modern
as heavy water. Moreover, a lively piece
of celluloid.
“Wild Gold”
At Sydney Capitol. A wandering
yarn in which Harry Green figures as
proprietor of a travelling vaudeville
show. Sentiment by John Boles and
Claire Trevor. Claire, a torch-singer,
has left her worthless husband (Monroe
Owsley) and, having nowhere else to go,
lives in the cabin of a golden-hearted
old prospector (R. Imhof). Boles, a
young engineer, is also a boarder. Worth-
less husband robs g.-h.o. prospector;
dam breaks and wipes out mining town-
ship, drowning Claire’s husband and
paving way to wedding bells. Good
character-acting by Green and Imhof
gives an air of plausibility to the uncon-
vincing old tale. An unpleasant feature
is the crooning of Miss Trevor.
“The Line-up”
Marion Nixon, the heroine of this
gangster drama, is framed for a theft
she didn’t commit. William Gargan, as
a bright young detective who hopes to
marry her, gets her released on bail so
that she may lead the police to a gang
that specialises in fur robberies. She
does so, but is shoved in a cool store
filled with ammonia fumes, and there is
suspense until the detectives break in.
John Miljean and Harold Huber, as prin-
cipal villains, and Paul Hurst, as a bully-
ing policeman, contribute some smooth
acting; and the line-up scenes are effec-
tive.
“Riptide”
Despite the presence of Herbert Mar-
shall, Robert Montgomery and Norma
Shearer, luxurious settings and super-
sophisticated talk, “Riptide,” at Sydney
St. James, is dull. The characterisation
is poor, and the story has been done to
death. Marshall is a humorless Eng-
lish peer who, while visiting New York,
marries a local woman who did—did, to
quote Kipling, “not once or twice.”
Norma Shearer plays the erring female.
At Cannes she falls again with Robert
Montgomery. Alarums, excursions, re-
proaches, hysteria, and then husband and
wife are reunited by the agency of their
innocent child.
Mrs. Pat Campbell, as a woman of
fashion with some smart comedy lines, is
the most acceptable of the lot. She must
have grinned at the thought of how often
she had played Norma Shearer’s part in
Queen Victoria’s reign.
Sundry Shows
Setting of “The Wind and the Rain,”
which opened at the Sydney Cri. on
Saturday under the Firm’s banner, is the
sitting-room in an Edinburgh boarding-
house. It is shared by four medical
students, and the play covers the period—
four and a half years—taken by the
brightest of these to qualify. Central
character, played by George Thirlwell,
is of the sensitive, introspective type;
unassertive, reliant on others. He’s the
only son of a widow, and when his
mother dies it is only his need for sym-
pathy that gives him the impetus to
sweep his sweetheart into marriage. The
part is quietly, effectively acted. Jocelyn
Howarth, as the art student from Maori-
land who lingered on in Edinburgh be-
cause the widow’s son needed her so
much, is equally convincing. Nicely-
shaded character-sketches are also given
by Arundel Nixon, as a French medico
somewhat desultorily studying for his
F.R.C.S., and Patricia Minchin, as a cock-
tailing flapper. The play’s claim to be
a comedy is almost entirely contingent
on the role of Gil Raymond, very comic-
ally played by Tommy Jay.
Author of the play is Maorilander Dr.
Merton Hodge, who has drawn upon
memories of his student days in Auld
Reekie, not so many years distant, and
the atmosphere seems authentic. The
dialogue is natural in the circumstances
and not unduly coarse. Even the ebul-
lient Gil has manners. Plot is as tenu-
ous as gossamer, but the characters are
all interesting, and if Nan Taylor’s Mrs.
McFie had a real Scottish accent the
presentation would be hard to fault in
any department. Gregan McMahon is
producer, and his hand is evident in
many important little details.
* * *
Nothing dates so palpably as drama.
Galsworthy’s “The Fugitive,” presented
by the Independent Theatre at the Syd-
ney Savoy, seems archaic, although it is
only about, 20 years old. The dispute
between George Dedmond and Clare, his
wife, is fought out with an intensity and
a grimness that appear ridiculous to a
generation that likes matrimonial battles
garnished with bright epigrams and smart
back chat. Then Malise, who fills Clare’s
head with notions of freedom, is a dull
person according to modern notions.
Yet the play is well worked out and inter-
esting, and it deserved the care always
devoted to Miss Fitton’s productions.
That Annie Hughes, who played the
Cockney landlady, should have scored
acting honors is attributable more to her
experience than to any weakness on the
part of the others. Jane Conolly as the
wife and Clive Coppard as the husband
were well paired. One could understand
why such a wife could run away from
such a husband. John Wyndham might
have been more masculine as Malise,
though he showed sufficient poise in the
first act and struck the right note of dis-
traction in the last act. Don Finley de-
signed the scenes.
Sean O’Casey’s “The Plough and the
Stars” is to be this group’s next pro-
duction.
* * *
Douglasism, or something very like it,
is proposed as a cure-all in Musette
Morell’s “Take It or Leave It,” put on
by the Morell players at Sydney Savoy
one night last week. The arguments
paraded are amusing, if not convincing,
and the comedy was well handled. A
young Irishman who has been selling
brooms to dodge the dole comes into a

ABORIGINALITIES
“Flinders Reef”: Permit me to intro-
duce Chromileptes altivelis, a rare and
distinguished visitor to Queensland. The
chap I have in mind came ashore a week
or so ago at Cape Moreton, and was im-
mediately received as his exclusiveness
and dignity commanded, being only
the third of this race to visit the banana
State. He now sleeps in peace in Bris-
bane Museum. A member of the cod
family, he is common from the N.T.
coasts through Malaya and the Chinese
littoral. His particular attributes are a
turned-up nose, a humped back and a
brown complexion dotted with large,
dark spots. Looking at him the other
“No: I won’t gib Mary up! You're making up all these lies you hear about
her.”
day, I was irresistibly reminded of the
seven red-headed, freckled daughters of
lan Mclnverary, who used to own Elun-
gry Downs, somewhere in Queensland, a
pack from which I narrowly escaped in
my jackerooing days.

Billabong : Though Ive seen kooka-
burras kill only small snakes, a tame
magpie I know will tackle all sorts and
sizes, from tiger to whip. At such a time
the peculiar call of Madge will bring
her kin in droves from all quarters ;
after a few minutes the snake resembles
a reptilian flute, with punctures from
head to tail. South Aus. protects the
magpie, as some of its ’ologists have seen
the birds feeding young snakes to their
brood.
* ❖ * *
“Ornis”: Sydney’s Zoo has become
something of a wayside pub for migrat-
ing birds. The honeyeaters, following
the blossoming banksia, are regular
visitors; but more interesting are the
snipe and curlew which pay a brief call
on their way south after a flight of
thousands of miles from Siberia. These
usually arrive about August, to return
again to their breeding areas in Northern
Asia when spring is coming in up there.
“Pick”: The furry denizens of bush-
land seem to be trekking citywards—in
N. S. Wales, at all events. From the
street trees in Summer Hill the chuckle
of ’possums disturbs the night. Rabbits
have warrens at Mortlake and St. Luke’s
Park. Foxes raid the hen roosts at
Bankstown and Merrylands. Native-cats
have taken apartments in the rocks at
Oatley; many water-rats forage the
banks of George’s River, where once
there was none. Shyest of all, bandicoots
now regularly loot gardens in Gladesville
and Ryde.
* * * *
“Duckbill”: A Sydney paper last
week held an ad. offering a reward for
a lost stole of platypus fur. The stole
was made before the beasties were pro-
tected, and, as the fur is practically
indestructible by wear, has many years
of use ahead of it. Neither the owner
nor Sydney’s leading fur-dealers could
put a value on the thing, valuable
as it undoubtedly is ; there has been no
market for the skins for years. Long
ago rugs made of platypus-skins were not
uncommon in some parts of Queensland,
and they were always rated at a very
high value, rarely less than three figures.
It takes a great number of the prepared
skins, measuring Bin. by 4in., to make a
decent-sized rug.
“Travel Stain” : Along the Walsh and
McLeod rivers, which drain into the
Gulf of Carpentaria, are hundreds of fine
brumbies, some of which were driven
off the roads by motor transport. Most
of them, however, are tossing their manes
where they and their mothers were born,
and they are increasing in numbers every
year. Three years ago, when horse
pelts brought a few bob more in the
market than they do now, these brumbies
were shot in hundreds ; but through the
lowered prices, plus the hard work of
skinning, they are now left in peace,
They rove in little herds, each under
the domination of a stallion, and if one
dares to challenge that supremacy a
merciless battle of tooth and heel settles
the issue,
* * * *
“Cooie-Bird”: Another Bananaland
tree that fruits along its main stem and
on the bases of its main branches (B.
6/6/’34) is the sandpaper-fig. The fruit
is large (about round) and showy.
Despite its appearance it has little of the
fig flavor about it, and is generally so
badly infested with a small fruit-eating
flv (not the fruit-fly maggot) that it is
thrown down in disgust. The tree is
usually found on the banks of water-
courses, often growing to a large size.
The leaves are unpleasantly rough to
the touch, hence the name. ’Possums
and flying-foxes are fond of the big fruit.

Fanny, our house-gin, pointed to the

youngster astride her hip and announced,
“My bin callem this boy after you,
boss: him name Beresford Bambo-
wigeberi.” Dad inquired what the abo.
part of it meant. “Oh, that ‘Bambo-
him mean just like you, boss ;
gottem belly all same like pie-melon.”
* * * *
“Beni Hassan”: As “Cudgerie” says
(B. 27/6/’34), the Western Queensland
“mickery” is only a survival of the age-
old contrivance for raising water which
the Arabs call the shaduf. Minor irri-
gation in Egypt is mostly carried on with
these, helped by an
occasional water-
wheel. Along the
banks of the Yusuf
Canal, which skirts
the western edge of
cultivated Egypt
for some distance,
hundreds of such
machines can be
seen raising the
water from the
deep-sunk canal by
as many as three
tiers of shadufs.
The brawny ruf-
fians who man
them do no other
work, and live in
their own villages
along the banks of
the canal. They
are rated the most
dangerous and
criminal class in all
Egypt. One Aus-
tralian L.H. squad-
ron-1 ead e r, sta-
tioned on the canal
bank, adopted a
shaduf for water-
ing his horses, im-
provised troughs
being fixed up. The
whole gadget • cost
about a pound, and
was a big improvement on the earlier
method of dragging buckets by hand up
a steep and slippery bank.
**; * *
“Taaf”: The river flats near a Maori-
land township were alive with activity.
It was the day of the sheep-dog trials.
Butcher, favorite for the main event,
headed and divided to perfection, and
then his boss gave the order to “bring
in.” Butcher loped up to the four wait-
ing sheep, hesitated and suddenly darted
off. In a couple of seconds he was over
a hill and out of sight. End of Butcher’s
chance. But during the last event a
roar burst from the crowd. Along the
flats, shepherded by a triumphant But-
cher, came a flock of sheep, a steady,
unbroken mob of two hundred.
* * * *
“Bauwa”: Binghi and the Fijians are
not the only primitives who dye their
locks (B. 20/6/’34); the practice seems
general throughout Polynesia and Mela-
nesia. In the old days coral lime was
used, being worked into the hair as a
heavy paste and allowed to dry. When
removed the fuzz was a reddish color,
accentuated by subsequent applications
in the same way as the Venetian beauties
whom Titian recorded on canvas acquired
their ginger locks. In the Western Pacific
civilisation has changed matters. The
now-sophisticated savage has discovered
that peroxide of hydrogen gives better
results and is far less troublesome than
the old method. No up-to-date trader
nowadays omits to keep a supply of
peroxide as part of his stock.
* * * *
“F.W.”: The crow-catching cage de-
scribed by “A.C.G.” (B. 6/6/’34) is used
in a slaughteryard in Western Queens-
land, a heap of horns acting as per-
manent bait. When a fair number has
joined the chorus they are collected by
two Chinamen, who remove the captives’
gall-bladders. Whaffor, and why parti-
cularly crows?
❖ * s':
“Billy See”: While epicures enthuse
about the Maoriland toheroa, let me
enter the Westralian mutton-fish, found
on the rocks from Fremantle to Gerald-
ton, for a place. The muttony is a
univalve of the limpet family. Nearly
the size of a man’s palm, it resides in
the wash of the waves, and to be success-
fully captured must be taken by surprise,
the usual method being to drive under
the big sucker with a screwdriver or a
chisel. A miss means that the mollusc
will grip like grim death; it will
part with its shell sooner than let go
the rock. Cooked as it is, the mutton-
fish resembles a piece of rubber tyre.
Macerated with a heavy file or a brick,
it fries to a golden yellow and tastes as
good as the best snapper. Boiled to a
soup or stew, it provides a thick gravy
like beefsteak —fit for a Roman banquet.

“Plato’s Brother”: The natives of
Badu Island, Torres Strait, work on a
thoroughly Communistic basis: they
make their own laws under expert white
guidance; the crews of their trochus
boats elect their skippers ; in the slack
season, when wild weather forbids their
going to sea, they eat out the common
abundance reaped in the good season.
Their store is publicly owned, and
assistants, even the typists, are natives.
It was started by a parson on limited
company lines, and the maximum divi-
dend in good or bad trading is 5 per cent.,
but shareholders don’t take the dividends.

“Bam ’: White calves with colored
mothers (B. 16 /5 / ’34) are not rare when
the shorthorn breed predominates. We

for years they had pure-white calves.
The rest of our stock were shorthorns,
and the black cows’ progeny were only

THE NORTH WIND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
J lie south wind blew
With a reedy sigh
Through the dust-dimmed haze
Of a cloudless sky.
And the old hands said
“There’ll be no more rain
Till the wind blows back
To the north again.”
And they were right,
As the people are
Whose lore is gained
From the sky and star;
Tor the tall trees drooped,
And the sparse feed died
On the hills and plains
Where the white bones dried;
Till a grey dawn broke
On a wind-tossed waste,
Where the bent trees bowed
And the wurleys raced.
And the day passed on
Till the storm rode high
O’er the dark’ning track
Of the evening sky.
And the next dawn broke
Through a pall of rain,
As the joyful frogs
Made their gruff refrain,
And the rising creeks
Showed the old hands know
What the winds will do
By the way they blow.
For the north is the wind
For the far outback,
Where the storm-clouds gather
Along its track.
But the south wind blows
With a reedy sigh
Through the dust-dimmed haze
Of a cloudless sky.

“Bundamba”: Queenslanders inter-
ested in that sort of thing are grinning
at the hullabaloo raised by scientists
in other States over the “recent” dis-
covery of huge birdlike footprints in the
coal seam of a colliery near Ipswich.
They were spotted on the roof of the
seam seven or eight years ago. Intelli-
gent miners reported them as the foot-
prints of some gigantic fowl. As no
chook of any kind existed in the days
when the coal seams were being laid
down by Mother Nature, scientists
snorted haughtily and ignored the matter.
Now it has dawned on them that the
prints are those of some of the gigantic
lizards that were on deck in the swamps
which ultimately became coal. This par-
ticular crowd were the dinosaurs, frag-
mentary remains of which have been
found in other parts of Queensland. The
arresting part of it all is that this is the
first direct evidence of the existence of
these lizards as late as the carboniferous
age.

“Si Anu”: While Southern Australia
has been sweltering in unseasonable
warmth, Singapore has been shivering. So
severe was the blast, which is attributed
to excessive freeze over Siberia, that for
a few nights a shortage of blankets was
experienced. On a couple of occasions
hailstones fell, an occurrence said to be
“See many big-game hunters in these parts?”
“None bigger’n yourself, mister.”
unique ; but I can testify that it was not.
In 1912 I was with some Malays on a
shooting expedition near Kedah (F.M.S.)
when we were smitten by hailstones
larger than any I had ever seen. The
natives soon got over their surprise, and,
recognising that the stuff was similar to
the ice manufactured locally for the
Street drinking stalls, they gathered a
basketful and munched the lot. '

“Kumusi Crossing”: Though I have,
literally, watched millions of flying-foxes,
I never saw one scrambling about pro-
jecting snags or dipping branches when
seeking a drink of water or of anything
else (B. 27/6/’34). As the bat is a fruit-
eater pure and simple, his tucker pro-
bably provides him with iall the liquid he
wants, as is the case with many other
animals. In any case, he would hardly
need the help of branches. Though no Jim
Carlton, he is quite a decent crawler,
and any sandbank would give him the
chance of a drink if he wanted one,
though the problem of rising again might
intrude here. Some observers credit
the flying-fox with drinking on the wing,
as the smaller bats and many birds un-
doubtedly do, but the writer has never
seen one try it.

“Bingle”: At the Mining Exchange
Hotel, Herberton (N.Q.), you can see a
set of false teeth cast in pure tin. A
scratcher without any dental training
made them for his own use. A lighter
set made with an alloy replaced the ori-
ginal dentures.

“Rokko”: We heard a great commo-
tion in the yard the other day and rushed
out to investigate. On the ground were
two magpies, their claws securely locked
together as they flopped about with
raucous cries, to the deep interest of
about 20 others of the tribe. The com-
batants, still with a claw-grip on each
other, managed to rise, only to descend
heavily in the vegetable plot. We fol-
lowed, now intent on capture, but they
rose again and reached the garden.
Thence they struggled to the road, and
finally were seen plunging about the
bush, still with the gallery of relatives on
their trail. We gave up the chase, but
from the uproar in the bush interest was
still keen.

“C.M.8.” (County Down, N. Ireland):
“H.C.M.” (B. 14/3/’34) writes of goats
and sheep leading cattle into the
yards. Here every farmer who owns
a few cattle also has a goat, which
follows the herd. Don’t know whether
the goat is used as a leader ; I asked one
farmer about it, and he said it was “for
luck.” It is a quaint picture—four or
five cows, led by a goat, moving from
the farm buildings to a field, and there
cropping the grass together all day. These
goats are not hobbled ; but with ordinary
goats the fore and hind feet are fastened
together, off to off and near to near,
with a piece of rope, sufficiently tight to
make it very uncomfortable. Sometimes,
also, they are tied neck to neck by a
chain.

“J.L.”: Kookaburras and snakes (B.
13/6/’34)? Riding along the track to
the Lakes, off the Yamba-road (Clarence
River, N.S.W.), I saw ahead of me a
jacky flat on the ground with wings out-
spread. On a nearer inspection I found
a green snake about 4ft. long across the
bird’s back and pinned down by its
wings. Both looked very foolish, and
after waiting a few minutes I stepped in
and killed the snake. Jacky left hur-
riedly and didn’t return for his dinner,

“Hornby”: Fans (as conveniences,
ornaments and instruments of coquetry)
were not uncommon among savage
Binghi. Nor’-west W.A. and far-out
N.S.W. and Queensland tribes regularly
used ’possum and other small animal
skins stretched on forked sticks and
bound with sinew as breeze-producers on
hot days, and for gesticulatory and sym-
bolic purposes at their corroborees. In
deference to the arrogant sex, those used
by the lubras were about half the size of
the bucks’. The flappers of the Arunta
tribe used tiny fans made from the skin
of the white bat, and in affairs of the
“Oo! listen to the lovely contented coo of that darling dove”
“How d’you know the blarsted bird isn’t divorced?”
heart these were more eloquent than the
lips of their wielders, which were often
sealed by tribal custom. The belles of
the Wai-Willum (Pine Creek, N.T.)
tribe, upon whom tribal restrictions in
love-making were prohibitive, similarly
used jabiru-wing fans.

“Surveyor”: Those N.T. white-ants
(B. 6/6/’34) may be fast workers, but
they’re not in it with the termites of
Central Queensland. To quote only one
case, ants built right up a man’s bunk,
over his forehead and down the other
side in one night. It wasn’t a big nest;
but if anyone knows of slicker work I’m
ready to listen.

“Bucko”: My nomination for the
Death Before Desertion of Duty Stakes.
When the Grand Central Hotel
at Sarina (Q.) recently went up
in smoke a muscovy duck was
sitting on a clutch of eggs near
the rear of the building. All
through the fire she remained on
duty. After the flames had sub-
sided the old fowl was seen to be gasp-
ing somewhat, and her feathers were
badly singed, but her eggs were intact,
and hadn’t suffered.

“Diba-More”: I ran across the first
regatta for model craft in Papua the other
day, the competitors being a number of
natives, each with a model of either a
canoe or cutter. After receiving their
tobacco ration on Saturday afternoon
they repaired to the river, and each starter
paid an entrance fee of two sticks. The
handicapping was then carried out, the
favorite starting last. With a large red
handkerchief for a sail, it was “alia same
launch.” Shrieks and barracking fol-
lowed the race; after a close finish the
favorite won, and its owner proudly col-
lected the combined entrance fees of the
other competitors. The losers took it
philosophically, and one told me that they
would get plenty to smoke for the coming
week from their less sophisticated bush
brothers. The next step which I expect to
see in the march of civilisation is a fat,
hook-nosed native, with a rubber scrap-
bag resting on his stomach, laying the
odds.

“L. Ansell”: I’ve never washed out of
a tin matchbox (B. 2/5/’34), but an old
carrier showed me a neat dodge. Having
no dish, he scraped a shallow hole in the
sand, lined it with brown paper, filled
the depression with water and washed at
his leisure without spilling the precious
fluid. A similar improvised dish served
to mix the damper in.

“Lancewood”: “Bally's” mate (B.
13/6/’34) who claimed that Barcoo rot
and sunburn killed the roots ot the hair
on the backs of bushmen’s hands may be
right as regards B.R. But an old burr-
cutter who worked up and down the
Barcoo years ago, and who disdained
the use of a shirt (said it was too hot),
had a hide the color of well-tanned
leather and quite a respectable covering
of long, sun-bleached hair. Evidently
nature’s effort to protect the skin.

Sober reproof to “Felis” (B. 6/6/’34),
who doubted the existence of tiger-cats,
spotted or otherwise:
“Dry”: The Australian “tiger” is too big to
be called a cat; it is six times the size of puss.
I have trapped and killed several. Being noc-
turnal, they are seldom seen, hence these doubts.
I always let the big ones go—l was. afraid of
them, and they of me. They crawfished back-
wards slowly, steadily eyeing me until' out ol
sight. Their color was reddish-brown mainly,
with yellow patches, chiefly on the belly.
“Adam S.”: Tiger-cats? They were the
only animals feared by abos. When a
boy I just missed seeing two taken from a
hollow log close to Gympie (Q.). These were
stuffed and set up. They were handsome speci-
mens, about double the size of the little spotted
fellow, and with stripes instead of spots.
“N.K.C.”: I saw a tiger-cat and young in
captivity at the Biology School of Melbourne
University. They were yellow-spotted, ' .re-
sembling a ferret in appearance. It is impossible
to mate them with the domestic cat. The
chief Vic. authority is Mr. Fleay, who has a
private zoo in Toorak.
“Wodai”: My big half kangaroo- and cattle-
dog bailed up a real tiger-cat in ( the long
herbage in Queensland once, and,-after flatten-
ing a square perch of grass in a fight with
the stranger, left me to finish the job. After
looking at the way he treated my canine, I
was satisfied to let him alone.
“Bucko”: A fine specimen of tiger-cat was
recently shot at the Tweed Heads (N.S.W.). It
was spotted, and 30in. from the nose to butt of
tail. The head was foxlike, with snout of a
’possum and teeth and whiskers of a cat.
“Searchlight”: On the Dorrigo (N.S.W.) years
ago there were numbers of these animals, and
writer himself killed one which measured 4ft.
6in. from tip to tip. It was striped, and bore
no resemblance either to a native-cat or a
house-cat. In the scrubs at night these animals
stage fierce battles; I have witnessed two such
fights by moonlight. The tiger-cat has a dis-
tinct call unlike the house-cat.
“De M.”: A Mudgee (N.S.W.) man found
a tiger-cat clinging to the wool on the back ot
a sheep while it tore at the flesh. A tiger-cat
is much larger than the native-cat, and may be
distinguished by its spotted tail, the spots on
the native-cat being confined to its body. _
“Old Boy”: I killed a tiger-cat in the Plenty
Ranges (Vic.) in the ’seventies. Another one
was caught near Yea after it killed several
turkeys. My capture would have made six ot.
the little native-cats; I am certain it was a
marsupial, and its tail seemed too long tor
its body.
THE LITTLE BIT UP THE SLEEVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When you have gone over and mapped the
ground, and everything’s figured out;
When you are quite certain that you have found
an answer to ev’ry doubt;
When the cost to the final ounce is weighed
and the balance is your way;
When your cobbers their chosen parts have
played and the critics have had their say;
Unless to the game you are very new, you will
know before you leave
That it’s just as well to make sure that you
have a little bit up your sleeve.
You will find that the things you counted on
are not as they seemed before;
You will find the doubts that you thought had
gone come crowding around once more;
For little works out in the way we plan, and
the further that we go
The more we find in the path of a man, and
the less we find we know.
But whatever haps in the way of ill, in your
star you may believe
If in all your troubles you’re holding still a
little bit up your sleeve.
You may find that your maps are mostly wrong
and your figures, are astray;
You may find before you’ve been going long
that others have been that way;
You may find grim warnings of what’s ahead
and what’s on either side;
And you may recall what the critics said, and
still feel sure they lied.
For then you will know to what it amounts,
and you will be strong to dare;
It’s the little bit up the’ sleeve that counts —
if your own hand puts it there.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
STUD SHEEP SALES.
“Murrawong”: A general survey of
the merinos put up at the ram sales in
Sydney leads to the conclusion that,
although the Sheep Show with its entries
classed and compartmented may have
been of educational value to visitors, a
truer estimate of the wool wealth of the
country was on evidence on the show-
floors.
It is hardly fair to compare the prices
obtained for champion show sheep with
the record prices of the sales, as many
studs were not represented at the Show,
which is a matter to be deplored. The
mere fact that several other sheep
realised a higher price than the grand
champion ram does not detract from a
title fairly won in open competition, nor
does it prove conclusively that higher-
priced rams are better sheep.
At the Show each sheep is judged on
its individual merits; at the sales the
prevailing factor is demand for certain
types and strains. This demand is in-
variably swayed in their favor by the
prestige of established studs.
The value of goodwill is more evident
in the sale of stud sheep than in any
other avenue of commerce. The man
who sets out to breed stud sheep for sale
is a pioneer in every sense of the term.
Although he may be a first-class sheep-
man with high-priced foundation stock,
he must be prepared to see his best sheep
ignored or sold cheap while buyers com-
pete for inferior animals bearing the
brand of some famous stud. Several of
the younger studs have given ample proof
that they are being capably handled.
Their reward will come in time.
There are studs which carry a wide
range of types. Pens of two to five rams
are offered, containing strong, medium,
and even medium-fine types, a mixture
of little use to any one breeder. Strict
specialisation of a definite type will
establish a new stud years earlier than if
it tries to cater for all tastes.
The sale of British breeds and Corrie-
dales showed a slackening in the demand
for anything but the best. Border
Leicesters met with a poor response, but
there was a keen market for good South-
downs and Dorset Horns, and the few
Ryelands were eagerly sought after.
There was a fine showing of Corriedales,
and the prices obtained, including a
record of 200gns. for a ram, indicated
their established popularity as a dual-
purpose breed.
THE CANCELLED WOOL SALES.
Harold Sims: Representatives of the
Australian Woolgrowers’ Council and
the National Council of Woolselling
Brokers have repeatedly stated that the
slump in wool values which necessitated
the cancellation of sales is due to the
German embargo on imports.
It wasn’t even a good guess, as cabled
London information from the Imperial
Economic Committee clearly reveals.
This committee found that the net
result during April and May—the first
two months of the operation of the ban
—is that Germany’s imports of wool
actually increased by 13,000,0001 b. com-
pared with the same months of 1933. It
is thus evident, the report says, that the
fall in Australian wool prices during
this period has been caused by the psycho-
logical effect of the ban, and has not been
justified.
In other words, our wool industry is so
uncontrolled that any old scare or bogey
is quite able to demoralise it.
EXPORT OF STUD SHEEP.
“Murrawong”: It is a question
whether the embargo should not be ex-
tended to Polwarths and Corriedales,
both merino crosses. Some Polwarths
recently seen were not only similar
to the merino in appearance but
the wool was finer in quality than that
of some merino studs. The question of
including Corriedales is not so important,
except that that breed may be acclima-
tised in parts of Asia and may eventually
make Japan independent of our market.
If we wish to hold our position as a
woolgrowing country we should prohibit
the export of any sheep whose wool has
a spinning quality of 56’s or better.
STRANGE WEEDS KILLED THEM.
“Jumbuck”: From time to time losses
of flock rams imported from southern
studs have happened in north-western
Queensland. Recently 300 bought at the
Hughenden sales died within a day or
two of the owners taking delivery. Un-
acclimatised, they fell victims to weed
growths to which they had been un-
accustomed.
The breeders were, of course, blame-
less. Rams trucked over long distances
from the south and fed artificially on the
way should not be turned out straightway
on native pastures or stock routes. They
should be gradually weaned off their
previous fodder by hand-feeding on
lucerne hay for a few days. Better spend
a bit on hay, even if it’s the price of a
few rams, than risk losing the lot.
SKELETON WEED.
“H.U.C.”: Skeleton weed was not re-
ported in Australia before 1918, when
E. Field, of Marrar (N.S.W.), sent a
specimen to the late J. H. Maiden, then
Government Botanist. “It is almost as
tough as a bundle of wire, and is going
to be troublesome,” wrote Mr. Maiden ;
and Riverina experience has justified the
prophet.
Seed dispersal is rapid, but the great-
est source of danger is from implements
transplanting parts of the roots.
All farmers in wheat-growing districts
should become familiar with this weed
and try to eradicate it. Spray with
sodium chlorate solution (lib. per gallon
of water) before it spreads. Drive stakes
into the ground to mark the presence of
clumps or odd plants of skeleton weed ;
they can then be watched and given a
second spraying if required. With good
stakes this can be done even when a
crop is growing on the land.
Once the pest has spread thickly over
an area, chemical control is too expen-
sive. It is then best to encourage a
vigorous pasture by sowing Wimmera
rye, 41b., and sub.-clover, 31b.. per acre,
together with Hcwt. of super. In a good
season this mixture may be established
with a crop of wheat or oats. Top-dress
each autumn with fewt. of super, per
acre.
Stimulated by the super., these plants
will gradually choke out the skele-
ton weed, which will lose vigor due to
competition and the lack of cultivation.
It is foolish to grow wheat where skele-
ton weed is dense.
BEWARE THE CACTUS !
“Boomi”: There is a cactus boom
among Sydney gardeners and florists.
One enthusiast declares cacti are the only
possible indoor plants to go with modern
furniture. The trouble is that, when the
modern furniture goes to the attic, the
bowls of cacti will go into the dustbin
or over the fence on to the nearest vacant
land. It only needs one species to
possess a seed berry palatable to birds
and we shall be spending millions trying
to scotch another imported pest.
Photographs published showhundredsof
pots of newly-imported varieties of cacti
growing in the Sydney Botanic Gardens.
One charming thing resembles nothing
so much as the open jaws of a shark;
it needs nO imagination to foresee the
effects of this growth in stock country.
Since this quantity of plants could
not be needed for the gardens, it is safe
to assume that a number will find their
way to people who collect the hideous
stuff. In this way potential pests get
their start.
In Rockdale a ratepayer incurs penal-
ties if he has prickly-pear on his
land. In Woollahra one may grow
any variety of vegetable monstrosity
one wishes. In view of the Edgecliff
(Sydney) Post Office is a horror from the
Mexican deserts which towers up in a
column for about ten feet, and which is
studded throughout its length with spikes
which would pierce tanned leather. There
is a number of near-Spanish houses in
this district whose owners have been
persuaded that cacti are the only plants
that “go” with their homes.
A concerted drive should be made to
get rid of these dangerous growths.
QUALITY IN WHEAT.
“Fair Go”: It’s not as simple a ques-
tion as it looks to “H.U.C.” (B.
20/6/’34). As a general rule, high-
quality varieties are poor yielders, and
until the farmer gets some extra con-
sideration for lower-yielding wheats he
can’t be blamed for not growing them.
A case in point is the outcry against
Free Gallipoli. The Vic. millers claim
that the quality of the old Federation
was much better. The increased yield
of a bag or more to the acre with the
Gallipoli, of course, doesn’t concern the
miller, and I have never heard anyone
offering more for Federation grain.
However, the position may be im-
proved shortly if plant-breeders have any
luck. Both N.S.W. and Vic. are seriously
tackling the problem of breeding a
variety combining high yield and
strength, and, with the help of the latest
methods of milling and testing, should
be able to produce something worth
while. Everybody will be then happy.
“H.U.C.” puts it mildly when he says
that sometimes the f.a.q. system en-
courages slack harvesting. You’ve only
to watch the graders at work in any
of the big mills to appreciate that. Once
more, why should the cocky worry when
he doesn’t get any more for a good
sample? Still, the system probably suits
Australian conditions as well as any
other. Introduction of grades would
mean a lot more expense, especially in
the bulk-handling system.
POTASH DEFICIENCY.
“Hatter”: I disagree with “Sandon”
that the best test for potash deficiency is
to send a soil sample to the Department
of Agriculture (B. 20/6/’34). This will
be a guide to the quantity of potash in
the soil, but not to how much is available
for plant, life.
The best test is to experiment. When-
ever land of any kind has been improved
and made to yield higher crops a trial
should always be made to see if potash
is needed. J
In most countries it is the practice to
supply potash for all potash-needing
crops such as mangolds, potatoes and
legumes, as it is necessary to do so for
high yields. Further, it enables a plant
to withstand adverse conditions of SQil,
climate or disease.
Leaf scorch of fruit trees and early
dropping of the fruit are signs of potash
deficiency in orchards. Gooseberry-trees
in particular give the SOS signal.
TREATING DOBBIN S TAIL.
“Stumpy”: Occasionally a horse which
has been running bush will come in with
a matted and twisted mass of hair in its
tail —what we call a crow’s nest. That
crow’s nest cannot be pulled out, combed
out or straightened. Some resort to a
tomahawk or a butcher’s cleaver, which
leaves the horse in a still more unsightly
mess, besides adding cruelty if the flies
are bad.
There is a simple remedy. Render
down some fat in, say, an empty fruit-tin.
When that is liquid pour it over the
“nest” and slightly above it, taking care,
of course, that the end of the tail is not
scalded. To-morrow morning, or about
dinner-time, Dobbin will come into the
yard with the nest gone from his tail.
If no fat is available soft soap does
the trick, though this has to be rubbed
in. And a good lather of ordinary kero-
sene soap will do ; but it has to be a
heavy lather, worked in well.
In any case, with draught horses it
is advantageous to dock them. Not
heavily—heavy docking in fly country is
cruel; a light docking of no more that)
one joint is sufficient.
Docking is easy at branding-time. Part
the hair of the tail. Feel the joint at
which the cut is to be made—l recom-
mend the second joint from the end.
Cut quickly and cleanly with the knife.
Apply a hot iron—a little more than a
dab is needed. That stops the bleeding. A
little kerosene and fat or other dressing
will help heal the cut in no time, and
there is no danger of the flies working
into it. After that and for ever that horse
will grow straight hairs from the end of
his tail.
BUILDING SHED ROOFS.
“Bert, the Carpenter”: I have no fault
to find with the instructions for building
a shed given by “Dead Finish” (B.
20/6/’34), but will add to them, if
allowed.
When setting out your posts put a mark
on each, about a foot off the ground line,
but measured from the top of the post.
Drive a nail into each mark; on
these nails rest your straight edge and
spirit-level when levelling up the posts.
The posts levelled, lined up, plumbed and
rammed, if you are going to have a
flat roof bolt rafters to slots in the
centre of tops of posts, giving them at
least 9in. overhang at each end.
Next, get some long rods of fin. or
fin. mild steel, with a thread, nut and
big washer on each end, and some blocks
of wood measuring 18in. long, 6in. wide
and 3in. thick. In one end of each block
cut a channel as wide as the thickness of
the rafter and 2in. deep ; in the other
a groove to take the steel bar. Put the
long bolt through a hole in one post,
bored 2in. under the rafter and slanting
slightly downward, and carry it across to
the opposite post and through a similar
hole in it. Now put two of your blocks
of wood between bolt and rafter, spaced
equally, and screw up nuts until the rafter

S. H. PRIOR MEMORIAL PRIZE
To recognise the services to Australian literature of the late Samuel
Henry Prior, editor of “The Bulletin” for 18 years, his son, H. K. Prior,
has provided £lOO per annum for a prize, to be known as the S. H. Prior
Memorial Prize, which will be awarded every year for a work of fiction.
Entries for the first competition will close on June 6, 1935, and results
will be announced within two months thereafter.
The trustees, who will supply all relevant information to intending
competitors on application, will publish the successful work, together with
any others which they may deem worthy. The winning novel will be published
within two months after the announcement of the results.
Royalties at the usual rates will be paid on sales of works so published,
in which the entrants will retain ail property rights, except world book rights,
which will be controlled by the trustees.
Any bona-fide Australian resident or any person born in Australia,
New Zealand or British South Pacific islands will be eligible to enter, for
the competition, novels which must be the original work of the entrant and
previously unpublished, either wholly or in part, in book or serial form.
Manuscripts must be submitted under a nom de plume, and the true name and
address of the author must accompany each entry in a sealed envelope, which
will not be opened until the judges have made their decision.
The judges’ selections will be final, and competitors must accept as
binding the trustees’ decisions on other matters arising out of the contest.
The trustees, whose address is 252 George-street, Sydney, reserve the
right to withhold the prize if no novel submitted is, in the opinion of the
judges, worthy of an award.
above bends upward about l|in., the bolt
acting like the string of a bow. Treat
all the rafters in this way. Then put
on purlins and roof iron.
You can thus build a shed up to 40ft.
in width without having a single post
inside. If the roof should ever sag—
which is most unlikely—it can be put
right by screwing the long bolts a bit
tighter.
A gable roof is better, of course. First
lay the tie-beams out on the ground. Get
a pair of rafters, put their heels on the
tie-beam where it will meet the posts,
cross the tops at the right height above
the tie-beam, and mark on them the
vertical plumb cut at the crown and the
splay cut at the heels to fit the tie-beam.
Also cut out at the top of the rafters the
notching into which the ridge sits, and
use one of this pair of rafters as a pat-
tern for all.
Mark everything on the ground: the
ridge for where each pair of rafters will
go, the rafters for where the purlins are
to be nailed, and the purlins for where
they will meet the rafters. Then your
roof will go up with everything right.
Nail splayed heels of rafters firmly to
top of the tie-beams, and let beams over-
hang wall of shed by 9in., nailing the
fascia board which carries the gutter to
the ends and the top of it in line with
the purlins.
Let the ridge project the depth of a
purlin above the rafters, plus an extra
inch to go under the ridge-capping. Nail
a strip of angle fillet on each side of
ridge to take top edge of iron, and let
purlin ends project at least a foot over
each end of shed to take the barge
boards.
When the roof is up nail stout strips
of timber to rafters above and tie-beam
beneath, putting a temporary prop under
each beam. Again you have a roof with-
out a forest of posts inside to hold it up.

ing of cattle returning a good income. So
there was consternation when it was dis-
covered that farm cattle were infected
with tapeworm cysts. A good propor-
tion of Melbourne’s beef supply comes
from this Werribee undertaking, and when
the news of infection leaked out the de-
mand for the meat dropped 40 per cent.
Private cattle-raisers have always been
against the experiment at Werribee, and
the happening has given them and their
spokesmen in Parliament a fine chance
to oppose its continuance. The Govern-
ment stood to its guns, and, while ad-
mitting the infection, said that tapeworm
was only a “trifling” matter. It also
quoted medical opinion to the effect that,
provided the meat was properly cooked,
the cysts could be eaten without ill
effects. But no one hankers after eating
tapeworm in any guise, and the storm of
protest became deafening, especially
when it was publicly declared that beef
cattle from the farm had been sold since
the disclosure of infection. As I write,
the Government is considering its plan
of action ; meantime the sale of farm
cattle has been suspended.
If it is decided to cut out cattle-farm-
ing and dispose of the sewage by treat-
ment plant, Victoria will have to find
another £1,000,000.
A Sydney “D.T.” photographer got a
remarkably fine snapshot of A. J.
McDonald at the sheep sales. Now liv-
ing in retirement in Perth, Mr. McDonald
was commissioned by Westralian merino
stud breeders to buy rams and ewes
for them, being reckoned, in the
words of Westralia’s “Sunday Times,”
“the greatest of them all.” Certainly no
Australian can claim longer or wider ex-
perience. Grounded in wool qualities
at a Victorian mill under the eye of a
Bradford expert, McDonald worked as
a classer for many years, and has man-
aged properties in every State but
Queensland. He was for years with the
Chirnsides on Werribee and with F. B.
S. Falkiner, of Haddon Rig. He man-
aged Canowie (S.A.) when it spread over
16,000 square miles and carried 330,000
sheep; he was on Beltana when it
changed over from horses (it had 7000)
to sheep at a cost of £lOO,OOO. Under
his management, and thanks to Wan-
ganella blood, the average ewe clip rose
from 61b. to 91b. per head, and some clips
went as high as 141 b. 6oz. The veteran
was born in South Aus.
“Use caustic for dehorning when the
calf is not more than a week old.
Cut the hair from and surrounding
the horn base. Smear vaseline or oil
to prevent caustic from spreading to the
surrounding skin, and apply the caustic
to the stump. If properly carried out,
the horn will not grow.”— A. McK.
Clark, Chief Veterinary Officer, W.A.
Department of Agriculture.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Girder”: To make a handy brush
to clean any machinery of dirt, rust or
grease get some short lengths (about
6in.) of flexible wire-rope and bind to-
gether; keep binding about lin. from
ends.
“Whalebone”: Hand-shears no longer
useful for shearing make good clippers
for trimming a hedge or the edge of a
lawn. When blades break off they can
then be used as garden trowels.
“Outback”: If you want to put a
culvert in where termites are bad get a
couple of lengths of old railway rail.
They are everlasting, stand any amount
of weight, and will carry any type of
decking.
“Yarri”: For a quickly-made feed-
trough for horses sink two strong tree-
forks upright in the ground 6ft. or more
apart, place a sapling across to fill the
narrow part of the forks, nail a piece of
casing on top of that, and then nail
pieces at the sides and ends. The slant
of the prongs gives the right shape.
Forks also make good racks in the stall,
with light round timber at the sides in-
stead of boards or battens.
“Pick”: Ease the shafters by aug-
menting the braking gear when bringing
a heavy lpad down a steep hill. Cut a
stout, springy sapling. Bend it round
the wheel and lash it fore and aft. Hitch
rearward tie with a loop that can be
tightened up when the pressure slackens.
When the tyre has cut partly through
the pole, pull up on a level or chock
the wheels, and shift it a little back or
forward.
“Hatter”: A common error in feed-
ing pigs is making their food too sloppy.
When soaked it should normally be fed
as a thick porridge, but the quantity of
water should vary with the weather.
Digestive troubles and colds in winter
can often be traced to too much water.
Sour, wet food is a common cause of
illness. ,
“Saaedi”: During a drought bore
drains need close attention. In trying
to cross a drain the jumbuck occasion-
ally falls in, and, if the sides are steep,
he is apt to stay there. Crows will do the
rest. Not only that, but the body of the
sheep lying across the drain may so dam
the channel that the water will break
through the banks and flow over.
“Lucerne Flea”: There’s an art in
clearing ringbarked timber, especially
with badly-burning trees, such as red-
gum. Take a number of sheets of old
corrugated iron and some T-iron drop-
pers to use as stakes. Light a small fire
at the base of the tree, feed it until the
trunk is on fire, and then prop a sheet
of iron diagonally across the wind with
droppers to keep it in position so as to
direct a strong current of air on to the
burning trunk. It should cut the tree
off at the ground level. After the tree
has fallen, put the iron over the stump.
By shifting it about, you will be able
to burn the stump out to a foot or more
below the ground level.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
Is there any dingo-killing poison that can be
mixed with water without leaving a taste or
smell ? Should there be none available, what
is the nearest to it ? —2046.
Taste or smell, or both, are usually quite
distinct with poisons in sufficiently strong solu-
tion to kill. It is not considered that any
really satisfactory poison is available for disso-
lution in water.. Sodium arsenite is less bitter
than strychnine when dissolved, and may serve
your purpose.
Means of protecting potatoes from the
potato-grub after they are dug ? —2165.
Dip your dug potatoes in a solution of 1
gallon of Tuberol to 30 gallons of water for
half an hour. Tuberol is obtainable from
H. C. Pannifex and Co., 149 Stanley-street,
West Melbourne.
Formula for a salt lick for sheep ? Ewes
start lambing in two months. I have plenty
of grass, but all the nourishment has been
taken out of it by frosts. Showers have been
insufficient to make the feed gr0w. —2223.
The best way of supplying a lick is to place
out coarse salt and bonemeal in separate
troughs, which should be covered, and to
which the sheep have free access. Should a
laxative action be desired, up to 20 p.c. Glauber
salts (sodium sulphate) may be mixed with the
coarse salt. It is considered undesirable to
mix the salt and bonemeal, as the sheep will
adjust the relative .amounts of these constituents
required better than can be estimated.

LEAVES FROM THE PAST.
VIII— The Great Drought.
The chief bugbears of the Australian
farmer are droughts, bushfires and floods.
They are usually experienced singly, but
sometimes they occur in pairs, and occa-
sionally all at once.
Droughts vary greatly in severity. In
Broken Hill on a particularly hot day, a
drought often sets in towards evening
and is not broken until fresh supplies
arrive by the following morning’s train.
In other parts, droughts linger on almost
indefinitely. Everyone has heard of the
children in Centralia who rush to then-
mothers in terror at the sight of rain,
only to find that she doesn’t know what
it is. As a rule the grandparents are
able to explain the phenomenon, but in
very dry parts it is a new experience to
them, too.
The Great Drought occurred some
time ago, but mention of it still causes
dry throats. The districts most affected
were those known as “The Never-Never,”
“Back o’ Beyond,” “Out West” and “Up
North.”
Sheep died like flies (or, according to
some authorities, like dogs). This in
itself shows the shocking influence of the
Drought, because a sheep, however de-
graded he may be, always tries to die
like a sheep. Crops wilted away and
men abandoned their holdings to the
rabbits, whom
many suspected of
having engineered
the Drought.
It is difficult to
say how long the
Drought lasted,
but there used to
be a man in Wil-
cannia who claimed
he hadn’thadadrop
of water for 17
years, while Her-
gott Springs, after
a long spell of dry-
ness, got ashamed
of itself and
changed its name.
It is still dry, how-
ever.
After the Drought
had been in pro-
gre s s for some
time the mort-
gagees foreclosed
and relieved the
farmers of then-
farms. This was
known as Drought
Relief.
It has been sug-
ges t e d that the
drought problem
might be solved by
pumping the River
Murray up to the
Macdonnell
Ranges and allowing it to trickle
back. So far, vested interests—chiefly
novelists and short-story writers—have
prevented this : but one never knows.

THE SICK CHEERIO SESSION.
I was ill, so somebody switched the
wireless over to the hospital cheerio ses-
sion. A despondent voice, sounding as
if it was speaking in a funeral parlor,
said “Cheerio to you, dear sick people.
I hope you will all get better.” The voice
indicated a grave doubt.
“We must give what comfort we can,”
it continued, “to the sick and”
The word she checked upon was ob-
viously “dying.” I began to feel really
ill. The lugubrious singing of “Nearer
My God to Thee” made me wonder what
made the doctor look so serious,
although he had said I was getting on
fine.
Personal greetings to various listeners
suggested that the announcer was add-
ing mentally, “Well, this is the last oppor-
tunity I will have of giving you a call.”
By this time I felt inclined to send for
my relatives to hear my last wishes.
The announcer said it was necessary to
be cheerful to sick people; somebody
helped her to sing “To-day I Feel So
Happy” in a way that suggested that
their execution was due at 10.30 and they
were trying to show that they didn’t care.
I was dangerously ill by this time, but
the torrent of cheerfulness went on, with
a couple more hymns suggestive of a
funeral service.
I died at 9.45.

WANTED—A HAT.
For the inventor of a truly perfect
human hat, there is an enormous for-
tune in store. What Edison or Marconi
will now arise to supply a universally
felt want? It need not, of course, be
felt. Let it be of silk, paper or card-
board, so long as it is a really human
hat.
What is wanted is a Patent Universal
Adaptable Hat—suitable for all climates,
positions and circumstances. A hat that
will enable a man to dispense alike with
umbrellas and dustcoats. A hat that
will be brain-stimulating and thought-
provoking ; beautiful yet serviceable for
wear and for keeping private information
under.
‘Did you ’ave a leg broke once before, Tummas?”
"Did I what? This is the fourth leg I’ve ’ad broke now.”
Some men have the faculty of assimi-
lating the hats of others. To enter a
house or public place with an old hat,
and to leave it with a new one, without
pecuniary expenditure or physical exer-
tion, argues the possession of mental
grasp and adaptive capacity well worthy
of admiration.
The inheritors of the old hats may
think differently, but their opinions are
biased.
The hat is, doubtless, a capital index
of character. In fact, you can tell almost
anyone from his hat—if you look under-
neath it.
However, what is wanted is a new
hat. A distinctive type of headdress, pre-
ferably collapsible, so that it can be col-
lapsed in church, tram, ’bus or any other
place where space is limited, and can
yet be produced unostentatiously when
the time comes for passing it round. We
cannot expect to reach perfection in one
daring leap, but, to start with, let us
invent a hat that, at least, can be sat on
—an uncrushable, collapsible, beautiful,
everlasting, stain-resisting hat.
This achieved, the rest will follow
without effort. j q. u.

NEEDLESS TO SAY.
A friend in need’s a friend indeed
When Fortune’s in reverse;

Information Sought.
(1) Did the American-owned horse Sergeant
Murphy win the Grand National Steeplechase
in 1923 or 1924 ? (2) Did Jack Horner win
the race in 1926 or 1929, and was he an
American ? (3) Did Billy Barton fall in 1928
when leading, and who won ? (4) What is
Mount Danger’s breeding ? Is he bred to
win a race over the National distance ? —2194.
(1) In 1923. (2) In 1926. He was owned
by an American, but, like Sergeant Murphy,
was bred in England. (3) Yes. Tipperary Tim
was the only horse to finish. (4) Mount Dan-
gar is by Cistercian (imp). His dam, Canal, is
by Flavus, sire of Flavinius, Aurifer and Auro-
fodina. He should run the Grand National
distance, having won over two miles and three
furlongs at Randwick.
(1) Number of Commonwealth public ser-
vants and how many of them are returned
soldiers ? (2) Appointments to the Common-
wealth public service for each year since 1918
and the number of returned soldiers appointed ?
—2280.
(1) At June 30, 1933, there were 27,030 per-
manent officers in the Commonwealth public
service; 6292 were returned soldiers. (2)
1918-19, total number of appointments made
1580, number of returned soldiers appointed
172; 1919-20, 1585 (236); 1920-21, 2274 (529);
1921-22, 2595 (620); 1922-23, 1924 (518);
1923-24, 1790 (450); 1924-25, 2043 (352);
1925-26, 2256 (548); 1926-27, 2456 (843);
1927-28, 1526 (408); 1928-29, 1292 (351);
1929-30, 1114 (232); 1930-31, 194 (14);
1931-32, 56 (7); 1932-33, 187 (77). Total
number of appointments to the permanent staff
of the Commonwealth public service from July
1, 1918, to June 30, 1933, was 22,872, of which
approximately three-fourths were made to junior
positions, or were positions filled by females.
Total number of returned soldiers (as defined
by Section 7 of the Commonwealth Public Ser-
vice Act, 1922) was 5357.
List of picture theatres in the city of Sydney
and their seating capacity ? —2278.
Arcadia (764), Australian (990), Broadway
(1200), Capitol (2973), Civic (1802), Embassy
(984), Empire (2599), Empress (1024), King’s

How much did Sydney’s Harbor Bridge cost,
and on what sum will interest have to be paid ?
—2281.
Up to June 30, 1933, the total cost, includ-
ing the bridge proper, the approach spans,
roadway approaches, railway alterations, re-
sumptions, etc., was £10,057,170 7s. 9d. Of
this amount £1,339,027 1 Is. 3d. was for re-
sumptions, £1,414,401 9s. 2d. for interest dur-
ing construction, £2,065,429 for approaches,
and for the bridge proper (excluding wages
variations, etc.) £4,238,839 15s. 6d. Allowing
for adjustment of outstanding claims, the com-
pleted cost of the work should be about
£10,190,000. As the land tax collected, plus
accumulated interest thereon, amounts to about
£1,690,000, the capital sum on which interest
will have to be paid should be about
£8,500,000.
I have seen it stated that the first edition of
Sir Roger Tlierry’s “Reminiscences of Thirty
Years’ Residence in N. S. Wales and Vic-
toria’’ was so full of libels that the author him-
self withdrew it and substituted a “safe”
edition. Is this correct ? —2160.
No; there were certainly two editions of
the book, but both were published in 1863,
the second containing a few pages of addi-
tional matter, chiefly concerned with praise
of Governor Gipps’s policy. The first edition
is frequently on the market, the second very
rarely.
“Whitaker’s Almanack” for 1934 says “The
world’s slowest train, from Port Augusta, Aus-
tralia, to Kalgoorlie (1051 miles), takes seven
days.” Is this correct? —2o7B.
No; it’s absurd. The train leaves Port Augusta
at 11 p.m. on Tuesday and arrives at Kalgoorlie
at 2.30 p.m. on the following Thursday—39
hours 30 minutes. On another run it leaves
Port Augusta at 11 p.m. on Friday and arrives
at Kalgoorlie on the following Sunday, taking
38 hours 20 minutes.
What are the largest trees in the world, and
where are they ? —1958.
C. E. Lane-Poole, of the Forestry Bureau,
Canberra, states that the tallest living tree now
m Australia is 326 ft., a Eucalyptus regnans, in
Gjppsland. He also mentions another Euca-
lyptus regnans measured by a Government sur-
veyor at 375 ft., and one at Colac (Vic.) of
347 ft., but both these trees have been de-
stroyed. Ralph Townsend, of the Save the
Redwoods League of California, states that
there are a few trees in his State approximat-
ing 380 ft. to 390 ft., but the tallest redwoods
{Sequoia sempervirens) now standing for which
accurate measurements are available are 368 ft.
and 363 ft. in height respectively.
How are kangaroos born ? Can you quote
authorities on the subject ? —2090.
Marsupials, including kangaroos, are born
in the way common to all mammals, except the
platypus arid native porcupine (which lay eggs).
Immediately after birth the little one scrambles
up its mother’s fur and reaches the pouch,
apparently without any aid from the mother.
This has been observed several times, the first
record having been made by Prof. Barton in
1806, in giving an account of the American
opossum. Tn 1920 a similar observation was
made by Dr. Hartmann, and in 1926 the act
was observed at Taronga Park in the case of
a wallaby. The same process had been pre-
viously observed in New York Zoological
Gardens, in the case of Bennett’s kangaroo.
What is the nature and significance of the
symbols on the Australian florin ? —2092.
The larger shield represents the Pacific Ocean,
and the bordering shows six small shields to
represent the six States of the Commonwealth.
The little shields each have a chevron. The
smaller shield is quartered by the cross of St.
George, which flies at all naval stations, and
is a proper emblem for all six States. Within
the cross five six-pointed stars represent the
constellation of the Southern Cross. The crest
is a seven-pointed star which rests on “a
wreath of colors” and represents the six States
and the Territory. (The “wreath of colors” is
the heraldic form of the silken streamers which
tied the crest on to the warrior’s helmet.)
The supporters of the shield, kangaroo and
emu, regardant, and the motto, “Advance Aus-
tralia,” need no explanation.
(1) Is it a fact that the captains of the Can-
berra and Australia are both on loan from the
Royal Navy ? (2) Are there no officers in the
Australian Navy with enough seniority to fill
these positions ? (3) What has become of the
officers who were trained at Jervis Bay in its
early days ? —2259.
(1) Yes. (2) There are officers in the R.A.N.
senior enough to command such ships. The
following have at one time or another com-
manded large ships in the R.A.N., and some
have commanded R.N. ships and squadrons:
Vice-Admiral Hyde, Rear-Admiral Stevenson
and Feakes, Captains Pope and Farquhar Smith,
and Commanders Rhodes and Garsia. It should
be added that Messrs. Hyde, Stevenson, Pope
and Garsia are ex-R.N. officers. (3) No officers
trained at Jervis Bay have yet attained enough
seniority to be promoted to captain’s rank,
although several have attained the rank of
commander. Some at present hold appoint-
ments in command of ships, R.N. and R.A.N.,
and other important appointments. Some have
resigned; others have been retired from the
service.
What effect would motor-car sump oil have
on hardwood weatherboards if used as a paint ?
Would it act as a preservative ? —2lBl.
The result would be unsatisfactory. The
color would be a dirty brown, possibly vary-
ing in shade, the oil would remain moist and
the surface would collect dust and dirty every-
thing with which it came in contact. Various
proper weatherboard oils are on the market,
manufactured from linseed oil, creosote oil,
etc. In addition to preservative properties,
these retard the ravages of white ants and
borers.
How long should good wine retain its con-
dition after the cork is drawn? —2131.
A fortified wine, such as port, Madeira,
Frontignac or sherry, will retain its condition
up to a month after opening, provided the
bottle is kept corked. Dry wines, such as Bur-
gundy, claret, hock and Chablis, should be
consumed within 48 hours of opening the
bottle.
I have several empty paint-tins. How can
I clean them so that they may be used to hold
sugar, flour, etc. ? —2185.
Clean outsides by scraping. Fill the tins with
water and let stand for a few days, then scrape
as well as possible. Then fill with kerosene
and let stand a few days; the kerosene can
be used again, as it should be quite clean.
The paint should now be softened sufficiently
to scrape out cleanly. Finish by washing in
hot water. If the paint is very old and hard
turpentine and ammonia must be used, which
is more expensive than buying canisters.
My wife and I are. the parents of a badly-
crippled returned soldier who is contemplating
a serious operation. He is in receipt of a
pension of £5 per week, which is all we have
to live on. Should he die would we be en-
titled to any pension other than the old-age ?
2020.
Yes. Parents of a deceased ex-soldier whose
death was attributable to an occurrence that
happened while he was a member of the forces
are eligible to receive a war pension in respect
of his death if they are without adequate means
of support.
My electric radiator, rated at 1000 watts,
gives too much heat for my liking. How can
I reduce this? —2351.
A resistance in series with the line will add
resistance to the heater element, and thus reduce
the current consumption. Two or. three carbon
filament lamps (in parallel) will have the re-
quired effect.
How to rid a dog and his kennel of fleas ?
—2llO.
Fleas can be destroyed by applications of
3 per cent, creolin, or by the use of pow-
dered naphthalene or pyrethrum powder. These
stupefy the insects, which can then easily be
brushed or combed out and burned. The
stick-tight flea, which usually attacks the ears
of the dog, is best treated with a mixture of
paraffin and lard (1 to 3) or sulphur oint-
ment. Kennel bedding must be destroyed and
the surrounding floor-boards and cracks doused
with boiling water. Afterwards swab out with
crude carbolic acid or Jeyes fluid in solution
(1 to 50).
How to rid a pantry of mice ? —2lBB.
Block up holes in the pantry so that the
mice cannot get in, and cover or close up all
foodstuffs so that they find nothing to eat.
Set several small break-back spring traps every
night, changing the baits occasionally.
Is it dangerous to health to use aluminium
cooking vessels ? —2175.
Aluminium may be used safely for all cook-
ing. As in the case of all other metals, the
utensils must be kept scrupulously clean by
light scouring, and no food should be allowed
to stand overlong in them, as the metal is easily
ruined by acids. Soda should never be used
on aluminium, as it causes pitting.
(1) Can you suggest a few bush walks (about
16 miles ) not too far out from Sydney ? (2)
A week-end bush walk ? —2263.
(1) Hornsby to Castle Hill, via Galston
Gorge, Galston, Dural and Rogan’s Hill, about
16 miles; take the ’bus at Castle Hill for
Parramatta. Pymble to the Spit, via St. Ives
and French’s Forest, 15 miles. Signposts are
plentiful on both routes, but a road map is
useful. (2) Take the train to Campbelltown
and walk to Appin on the first day (11 miles).
Next day follow the road to Cataract River,
Broughton’s Pass, Wilton, Nepean River, Mal-
don and Picton, about 16 miles.
/ am 49 and have a chronic duodenal ulcer.
This has caused frequent hcemorrhages. (1) Is a
surgical operation advisable ? I have taken
pounds of alkaline powders. (2) Is linseed leu
a cure ? —2128.
(1) An operation is usually advised to
obviate danger of perforation and haemorrhage.
Recurrence of the latter suggests this course
in your case, but you should get personal
medical advice. (2) No.
I have pains in the lower back, extending to
the leg. One doctor diagnoses sciatica, and the
other lumbago. What is the difference between
the two complaints, and what will give me
ease ? —2129.
Lumbago is a rheumatism of the lumbar
muscles, the pain usually extending to but-
tocks and legs. In the latter' event sciatica
develops with inflammation of the sciatic nerve,
which, if unrelieved, may contribute to a
sciatic lumbago. The first essential in treat-
ment is removal of any septic focus, as chronic
constipation or dental sepsis. Rest is neces-
sary, and extremes in any * form must be
avoided. Salicylates and aspirin are freely
prescribed; under medical supervision iodide
of potash benefits in chronic cases. A lini-
ment may be smeared on locally for relief of
sciatic pain.
I am suffering from pseudo angina pectoris,
which comes on after a little exertion. What
treatment is advisable ? —2 111.
Treatment must depend on a doctor’s
examination. Many cases of pseudo angina
originate in chronic constipation, in which
case the toxic fault must be removed.
Names of hardy evergreen flowering shrubs
suitable for brightening a corner in a South
Coast (N.S.W.) garden; also native flora
which may be suitable ? —2169.
Any of these should suit you: Hibiscus,
hydrangea, camellia, veronica, oleander, budd-
leia and salvia. Native plants which can be
grown, provided the soil is not too sandy,
include Christmas bush, hakea, waratah,
Geraldton wax, callistemon (bottle-brush),
boronia, acacia (a big variety), brachysema
(Swan River pea bush) and leptospermum
(tea-tree). Other plants suitable for the posi-
tion are cannas and tall-growing begonias.
(1) When to sow dahlia seed in Sydney ?
(2) How are “green” dahlia plants grown ?
2161.
(1) Sow during July in soil containing at
least 25 per cent, of sand and rotted manure.
Allow 12in. between each seed to give grow-
ing room. (2) These are cuttings taken from
the sprouted tubers and rooted in sandy loam.
After the dahlias make the second row of
leaves (from the side of which laterals are
produced) cut off the main stem and plant it;
do the same with the laterals. It is possible
to get a dozen dahlias from each tuber. The
practice is followed particularly where an out-
standing variety is grown and there is not a
big supply of tubers.
(1) Where does Peruvian balsam come from ?
(2) From what tree is it taken ? (3) How is
it collected? (4) What are its chief uses? —
2163.
(1) From Salvador. (2) From a tree of the
order of Leguminosce ( Myrospernum or My-
roxvlon peneirce). (3) It is collected by natives
skilled in bleeding the sap. The juice is col-
lected upon cloths tied round the incision, the
cloths are boiled and the crude balsam is
pressed out of them. The balsam is clarified
and shipped in 561 b. tins. (4) As an antiseptic,
particularly for the dressing of wounds.
(1) To what extent has the Magellan Terri-
tory of Chile been settled by Britishers ? (2)
Name of the British newspaper published in
the territory? —2l77.
(1) Over one-fifth of the developed land in
the territory belongs to British subjects. At
least half the senior staff of the commercial
and industrial concerns, as well as a quarter of
the working shepherds, are British. Ninety
per cent, of the large sheep farms are man-
aged by British subjects, chiefly Scotch. One
Chilean sheep-farming co., which' is British-
managed, employs over 2000 men, of whom
about 500 are British. (2) The Magellan
“Times.”
Method of ridding a garden of slaters ? —2260.
Lay baits of Paris green (loz.) and pollard
(lib.) about their haunts, letting at least four
days go between each bait-laying. Keep up a
systematic hunt among rubbish and under pot-
plants and boards, and drop the “pigs” into
boiling water. Naphthalene placed about the
plants has also been effective, but it should
be given a light covering of soil in order to
keep the strength in the crystals.

De Witt’s Antacid Powder, the
wonderful quick-action remedy for
indigestion, is winning golden opinions
everywhere.
Thousands of people who had been
sufferers from chronic stomach pains
and all the serious illnesses caused by
indigestion, find that here is a new
scientific preparation that really does
what is claimed for it —relieve the
miserable weakening pain caused by
indigestion, and give back a healthy
“eat what you like" appetite.
Of all the host of letters that the pro-
prietors of De Witt’s Antacid Powder
for Indigestion have received, the fol-
lowing is one of the most vitally human.
READ THIS MARVELLOUS
LETTER OF THANKS
“ Some time ago,” says this sufferer
from terrible indigestion, “ I was
troubled with nasty bitter fluid arising
from my stomach and disliked my food.
I was in continual pain and soon had
to cease work and take to my bed. I
was sent to hospital for examination
and an operation for gastric ulcers was
performed. Later I tried to resume
work, but I had to go to bed again.
At last I heard of De Witt’s Antacid
Powder. I got a supply and this
seemed to stop the sickness so I decided
to persevere. After three days I was
able to leave my bed and get out-of-
doors. Before the first tin was com-
pleted I v/as able to enjoy my meals.
Pain and sickness were gone and I was
able to take long walks without
discomfort. I am now feeling better
every day.”
That is the written statement of
Mr. J. Harris, of 2 Dale View, Dale
Road, Derbyshire. In face of this will
you stay in misery and danger from
indigestion ?
De Witt’s Antacid Powder soothes
the digestive organs, cleanses away
impurities and poisons that cause
acidity, griping pains, sour stomach,
flatulence and after-mealtime pains.

Australian civil servants who complain
about their dire conditions are lucky they
were not born French. In France 80,000
officials have been dismissed, all salaries
have been cut 5 to 10 p.c.—they were low
enough in all conscience—civil pen-
sions are to be reduced by 500,000,000
francs and war pensions by 1,200,000,000
francs. And the Government hints this
is only a beginning.

It was no idle threat that Japan would
turn to South America if it could not get
reciprocity with countries on other con-
tinents. It has concluded a two-year
treaty with Uruguay, establishing “un-
limited reciprocal and most-favored-
nation treatment regarding tariffs and
commerce.” Citizens of either country are
to be allowed “to traverse or reside in the
other with full civic liberties.” But a
campaign to check Japanese immigration
into Brazil has been launched in that
country.

on him (the Tuapeka Council, which he
served, made him its freeman), and he
was the only living composer of an estab-

the prize for the musical setting “God,
Defend New Zealand,” which is sung all
over the Dominion. Tom Bracken wrote
the words.

“Cowan”: It was on May 27, 1844,
that H.M.S. Fly left Sydney (B. 13/6/*34)
to construct the lighthouse on Raine
Island (N.Q.). The tower was completed
in September, and for their , good work
each of the 20 convicts employed re-
ceived a remission of six months from
his sentence. The lighthouse was
operated for 21 years ; after that W. L.
Crowther, of Hobart, took a lease of the
island for guano production, but he didn’t
stay there long. Since then it has been
uninhabited. In the early days of the
lighthouse the Admiralty placed a
nymber of goats on the island to provide
fresh meat for shipwrecked mariners.
Some of the descendants are still there,
though what they live on except birds’
eggs is problematical.

“P. Mall”: “Thousands of all denomi-
nations,” says a cable, “filled Westmin-
ster Cathedral for the golden jubilee of
Cardinal Bourne’s entry into the priest-
hood.” He is the least diplomatic car-
dinal England has had in modern times,
and his downright methods have been in
evidence throughout the half-century
during which he has worked in or near
London, where he was born. When the
late Lord Halifax was trying to bring |
about an understanding between Rome
and Canterbury, Cardinal Bourne used a
celebrated phrase: “We will not pray
with you, and you shall not pray with
us.” It angered some, yet it merely
summed up in monosyllables Rome’s
traditional policy. Doctrinal questions
apart, he is everybody’s friend. Exeter
Hall, “Jix” and the Methodists had strong
support from him in most of their social
campaigns, and at the Athenasum Club,
which he frequented till a few years ago,
one of his intimates was the Anglican
Bishop of London.

From Fleet-street or thereabouts:
London is full of Australians. Bertie Demp-
ster was met strolling with his bulldog on Vic-
toria Station. Mrs. Henry Hill Osborne and
her mother, Madame de Beaupuis, were
glimpsed among front-seaters at the opera.
Composer Roy Agnew and his wife, Tasmanian
tenor Benson and Miss Roseby, of Kambala,
were seen in a box right opposite the royal
one in the Albert Hall on a night when Tauber
sang. The Reggie Staffords have a prize suite
at Grosvenor House, where broods almost as
deep a quiet as about their own station home.
Mrs. Francis Shaw and sister Mrs. Brennan had
a group of Sydney friends to lunch at the
Langham.
Sydney violinist Marjorie Hambridge was at
’cellist Patiagorsky’s concert at the Wigmore
Hall; at Margaret Baxter’s party at the Forum
Club there was that Colonel Simpson whose
grandfather, one of the first 150 settlers in
Victoria, is to have a special mention in the
centenary celebration. He deserves it; he died
trying to save a mate from a swollen river
when the two were bullock-droving.
Nelle Scanlan gave a great-do at her flat in
honor of her just-published novel, and here
came Maorilanders —thousands strong (or so
it seemed). The David Lows were there.


For easiest and speediest
tyre inflation ....
The “RENRUT” pump offers remarkable service, ease ana
efficiency in tyre inflation.
It is the pump with a quadruple compression—a double-
acting cylinder, drawing in air both with the up and
down stroke, so providing a volume usually
obtained only with a barrel twice the size.
Manipulation of this large volume is ren-
dered very easy by the inner high-
pressure cylinder.
Strongly built and handsomely
finished, the “Renrut” Quadruple
is the pump for speed and
service, to make inflation
easier than ever before.

ROVER “14” PERFORMS WELL ON TEST
COURSE
COMFORT AND ROADWORTHINESS OUTSTANDING FEATURES.
By FRED BERRY.
In the past, Australian motorists had to realise that,
where price and performance of family cars were deciding
factors, the British machine was severely handicapped, and,
generally speaking, patriotism had to give way to common-
sense.
No doubt the horse-power tax in the
U.K. had something to do with this sad
condition, for, as the home market
claimed first consideration, small and
fussy motors continued to be built to
minimise the taxation on home buyers.
The 14-h.p. Rover, which recently has
been put through a gruelling test over
The Bulletin’s course, should, when
given a slightly larger motor in the same
chassis—certain to follow as the result
ROVER 14 FOUR-DOOR SEDAN, tested over The Bulletin course.
of tax modifications —be a certain winner
in the future.
Even now, with the 14-h.p. motor
pulling almost 30cwt., the Rover’s per-
formance is well above the average.
The car is a splendid example of
British craftsmanship, incorporating free-
wheeling and silent synchro-mesh gears.
While maximum power output is not
high, the simple, remote control gearshift
makes high speed possible without pre-
liminary practice in gear changing. The
robust construction of all units should
ensure long service and freedom from
mechanical troubles.
The standard model 14-h.p. sedan used
for test purposes was driven by H.
Gearbox of Rover 14, showing readily accessible oil filler, dip
stick and sturdily constructed remote-control gear-change
lever.
Hawkings, and together with driver and
observer weighed 29icwt., indicative of
strong construction.
Speedometer reading stood at 5603,
so all reciprocating units had been
thoroughly run in and were functioning
perfectly.
Over the first section of the test course
through busy city traffic to Parramatta
splendid time was registered, due mainly
to the ease and simplicity with which
gear changes could be made, for with
synchro-mesh gearing and free-wheeling
the sturdy gear-lever could be placed in
any speed range without noise or effort.
Through open country past Baulkham
Hills the speedometer was kept steadily
around the 40 mark. Before reaching
Windsor, speed was reduced to 15 m.p.h.
and the gear-lever placed in neutral in
order to test the freedom of wheel-
bearings and reciprocating units over the
rolling section. The Rover covered 706
yards before coming to a standstill —the
best performance so far in this series.
Passing through Windsor and approach-
ing Richmond aerodrome, a timed trial
of maximum speed over a measured mile
was made. The time taken, 58sec.,
gave an average speed of 62 m.p.h., the
car steering easily and holding the road
well. Then came a speed climb of two
miles up the steep and rough Kurrajong
Hill. Second and third gears were used
throughout the climb, the motor revving
sweetly at 40
m.p.h. in second.
The time taken,
4m i n. 25s e c.,
while not fast,
was a good effort
considering the
w e i g h t - power
ratio of the car.
Returning down
the hill, emer-
ge n c y braking
equipment was
tested, the car
pulling up on a
tricky gravel sur-
face without
swerving unduly.
Through Rich-
mond a turn-off
along the Nepean
River through
Castlereagh was made, and here tests of
slow running and acceleration were con-
ducted.
First, and possibly the most critical,
test was running in top gear as slowly as
possible for a distance of 350 yards,
followed immediately by a similar dis-
tance “accelerated” on full throttle. This
test is valuable in determining the flexi-
bility of power units in traffic driving
and discovering “flat spots" in induction
systems.
Despite its weight the Rover showed
to distinct advantage, slow running being
clocked in 2min. 24sec., an average of
five m.p.h. Finishing the accelerated sec-
tion at 55 m.p.h., the time, 24sec., gave
an average speed of
30 m.p.h.—a very
good performance.
From a standing
start to 50 m.p.h.
elapsed time was 19
4-ssec., and here again
the easy gear chang-
ing proved extremely
useful. Further traf-
fic tests of accelera-
tion from a steady
speed of 10 m.p.h. in
top, third and second
gears followed, the
times being: Top,
12 4-ssec. ; third, 8
4-ssec. ; and second,
6sec.
Entering the main Western Highway
on the return journey, a test of the stop-
ping power of the hydraulic braking
equipment was made. The car pulled up
smoothly and without swerving in 19ft.
from a speed of 25 m.p.h., a performance
never before equalled by any stock car
on this market.
To determine handiness in congested
traffic and parking, left and right steer-
ing circles were measured —39ft. in each
case —a comfortable one-lock turn in any
main roadway. On return to head-
quarters the total time, inclusive of all
tests, for the journey of 117 miles was
checked and found to be 3hr. 20min., an
average speed of 35 m.p.h., proving con-
clusively the advantage of silent gears
and easy change control. Fuel used
(4gal. 5 pints) gave a consumption of
25.3 m.p.g., or 37 ton miles per gallon.
Examined mechanically, the Rover 14
shows that its designers have thrown old-
fashioned ideas to the winds, and have
set out to provide motorists with every
modern idea of proven value.
The 6-cyl. power unit with bore of
61mm. and stroke 90mm. has a swept
volume of 1577 cc. (R.A.C. rating 13.84
h.p.).
Valves are of the overhead type,
operated by push rods from camshaft
in crankcase. Valve gear is totally en-
closed and lubricated under pressure.
Camshaft on four bearings is driven by
silent chain from crankshaft. Detachable
cylinder head of lates't non-detonating
type is provided, and in cases where a
top overhaul is necessary timing marks
on the various units are readily found.
Engine is mounted on the chassis at
three points on live rubber blocks, two
immediately in front of the motor and
one behind the gearbox, thus absorbing
all vibration at its source and providing
smooth running at all speeds.
Exhaust and inlet manifolds are separ-
ate castings, and a down-draft type
S.U. carburettor with air cleaner and
silencer is fitted.
Fuel tank is located at rear of chassis,
capacity being 9+ gallons, with one gallon
reserve supply, and petrol is drawn to
the carburettor by means of a mechani-
cal pump driven by an eccentric from
the camshaft. Ignition is by coil and
battery, and is controlled by a lever on
the steering wheel for half its range and
by automatic mechanism in the distri-
butor head for the remainder.
Lucas electrical equipment is used
throughout, including “Startix” automatic
starting. Switching over to “automatic” the
motor cannot stall, for a relay instantly
comes into operation and sets the starter
motor in motion. Alternatively, conven-
tional starting can be used by depressing
the starter button.
Lubrication of the motor is by full
pressure, a gear-type pump providing
circulation to all bearings, timing and
valve gear.
Transmission is through single plate
clutch to four-speed and reverse gear-
box fitted with synchro-mesh type double
helical gears on third and second ratios
—top, third and second being “silent.”
Unit-type gearbox is provided, with
readily accessible dip stick in order that
oil level may be checked without incon-
venience.
Gear lever is centrally located, of
sturdy construction and of the “remote
control” type, being located abaft the
gearbox in a handy position. Rover-type
free-wheeling is built into the gearbox
and is controlled from the instrument
board.
Final drive is through open propeller
shaft fitted with Hardy-Spicer mechanical
universal joints to a spiral bevel, back
axle having a final ratio of 5.2 to 1.
Lockheed hydraulic braking system is
used on all four wheels, brake shoes
being of internal expanding type. Emer-
gency brakes, operated by central lever
mounted almost horizontally between
front seats, apply the rear brakes in-
dependently. A further interesting
mechanical feature is the harmonic stabi-
liser, the object of this device being to
limit the movement of the front end of
the car when passing over uneven roads.
Attached to the front of the chassis
immediately behind the bumper bar is
a two-leaved spring member fastened to
the dumb irons and extending outward
to the width of the wheels. A bob weight
is attached to each end so that lateral
movement of the frame is first absorbed
by this weight, and the return movement
is again retarded by the bob weights
tending to continue in their initial path.
In practice this device assists steering,
Push rods, rockers and valve springs in
overhead valve gear, illustrating simple
method of adjustment.
and in a great measure prevents “dither”
over rough going.
Steering is light yet definite, Maries
Weller gear being used.
Bodywork is solidly constructed, and
hardware and upholstery are of excel-
lent quality, while all exposed metalwork
is chrome plated.
Impressions gained during the test were
that the Rover 14 must be given full

marks for its stability and road-holding
qualities. Although gear-changing be-
comes necessary on steep grades when
high road speed is desired, the position of
the gear lever, coupled with silent gear
ratios, makes the operation a pleasure,
providing the enthusiastic driver with a
little diversion not otherwise possible in
these days of phenomenal top-gear per-
formances.
The Outlook for 1934
Effect of Streamlining.
Australia, as usual six months behind
the Old World in automotive practice,
at last gets the hang of how things are
likely to go in future.
The outlook now is unquestionably for
a maximum of change in appearance
without materially affecting structure or
mechanism, except, of course, in those
cars where radical changes can be made
without engendering public hostility or
excessive production costs.
This year marks a new era in motor-
ing, for as the result of sales competition
in the Old World progress of a pheno-
menal nature has been made.
It is, however, clear to shrewd execu-
tives that to pass these undoubted bene-
fits on to the man in the street in one
bold move would be courting disaster. It
would be next to impossible to convince
him that such drastic changes from
conventional practice—and, incidentally,
from reasonably satisfactory types—are
either necessary or desirable.
Higher compressions, aluminium heads
and general refinement in design have
resulted in a marked increase of power
in ratio to piston displacement, with con-
sequent improvement in road perfor-
mances. Coincident with the increase in
power output has been the “foolproof-
ing” of controls, automatic chokes, auto-
matic heat controls, automatic “Startix”
starting equipment, automatic clutches,
synchro-mesh and constant-mesh “silent”
gears, free-wheeling unitsi and, last but not
less important, almost perfect roadworthi-
ness and steering qualities due to inde-
pendent front-wheel suspension and cruci-
form-type chassis construction.
With all power factors improved and
controls reduced to the essence of sim-
plicity, body profiles must be altered to
take full advantage of these blessings.
Streamlining must be adopted to a
greater extent than ever before, and only
those closely connected with precise ex-
periments and accurate tests on various
types can fully realise the vital issues in-
volved in this change.
Economy is the keynote of motoring,
and true streamlining is the only pos-
sible method whereby the man of modest
means can derive the full benefit from
every gallon he puts in his tank.
Where next for the gear lever?
Unconventional placing on the
facia board in the New Citroen.
Indirect Top Gears.
Indirect top gears, used in pre-war
days by Cadillac in touring cars and by
Delage in racers, have this year been
adopted by Chrysler in all the high-
powered machines. For some unknown
reason, these overrunning high gears
did not catch on when first introduced,
despite the many advantages secured by
their use. The Chrysler auxiliary “top”
is a decidedly ingenious arrangement,
eliminating the use of two pairs of crown
wheels and pinions, as was the practice
when first adopted.
Now, when the road speed reaches 40
m.p.h., all the driver need do is lift his
foot from the accelerator pedal for an
instant, and on pressing it down again the
motor will be turning over at only 1500
r.p.m., instead of 2200 r.p.m. at 50 m.p.h.
Inside the gearbox centrifugal weights
of peculiar shape are retained by springs
until a predetermined speed has been
reached (usually 40 m.p.h.); then when
the power is taken off for an instant
these weights fly into corresponding slots,
thus bringing the over-riding top gear
into operation.
Undoubted advantages secured by this
new scheme will be greater silence at
high speed, lower inertia loads imposed
upon" all reciprocating units, longer life
of motor and improvement in fuel con-
sumption.
The Tour of Italy.
Mussolini has made sure there will be
no funny business in the running of the
4000-mile Tour of Italy for the cup
bearing his name. Standard stock
cars only must be used, and, to prevent
racing stables “ringing in” something too
hot, 100 cars of any type entered must
have been sold and delivered before the
machine is eligible.
As an offset to these stringent rules
competitors from all the world are being
wooed by the offer of £BOOO prize money,
together with free petrol, free hotel
accommodation and free' garage for the
ten days—a real inducement.
Speed and Brakes.
Few drivers seem to realise what a
tremendously powerful potential instru-
ment of destruction the automobile is
when driven at speed, and what damage
can be done when an object is struck.
At 20 m.p.h. the average driver feels
that, as he can stop in 15ft., nothing
much need be worried about, but a car
hits an object at that speed with the same
force as if it had dropped 14ft. from a
roof! At 60 m.p.h. the bump is equal
to dropping 120 ft., a point also to be
watched being that at 60 m.p.h. force of
impact is nine times as great as at 20—
not three times only.
Motorists who feel like “stepping on
the gas” to cut off a few seconds from
their journey should remember that
120 ft. drop from the tenth storey and
act with discretion.
John Cobb’s new Napier-Railton car
has just cleaned up a fresh batch of
world’s records. With a team of drivers
that included Fred Dixon, Cyril Paul and
Charles Brackenbury, all records up to
24 hours were attempted at Montlhery
(France). Lapping regularly at a speed
of 130 m.p.h. the first record to be
claimed was 1000 miles at an average of
121.31 m.p.h. Next the 12-hour at 121.19
m.p.h. and the 2000-mile at 120.71 m.p.h.
went by the board. With the 24-hour
record well in hand and but 4} hours to
go, heavy rain made driving conditions so
hazardous that when the huge car, driven
at the time by Dixon, got out of hand
and careered broadside madly in what is
probably the world’s record skid —half a
mile —the attempt was wisely abandoned.
The Trouble Lamp.
A.C. (Newtown, N.S.W.): Thanks for appre-
ciation. Tests will be tabulated and summary
published at regular intervals H.A.L.
(Bordertown, S.A.): Your criticism of car and
truck performance in soft sand is justified
from a country driver’s ■ viewpoint, but 90 p.c.
of car miles are over made roads without
sand traps. However, will endeavor to adopt
your suggestion G.S. (N.S.W.): For stan-
dard super-sports Alvis, main jet 120; if
special big-valve sports, with 30mm. car-
burettor, main jet 145. Tappet clearances, four
thousandths; measured when motor is at full
working temperature. If in perfect tune, clocked
road speeds should be 75 in top, 64 in third
and 47 in second. Flat spot is almost certainly
due to flooding of carburettor. Check float
level and look for leak in brass float B.S.M.
(Dubbo, N.S.W.): Heat generated in dift.
assembly probably due to badly-adjusted crown
wheel and pinion or tight bearings. Possibly
trouble will disappear after 500 miles’ running.
Oil you mention is all right J.J.N. (Seddon,
Vic.): Bearing knocks are not usually heard
when on full load, but rather on the over-
run. When crankshaft was straightened align-
ment of clutch-face or timing-gear may have
been altered. Either will set up the “growl”
you mention F.W.C. (Canterbury, N.S.W.):
Oil not cause of trouble; fault lies with worn
cylinders and piston rings. A rebore will set
matters right. Spirit you are using doesn’t help
matters... .J.W.W. (Wagga, N.S.W.): Car you
mention is a good example of that particular
type, and oil consumption is not unduly high.
Narrow track is sometimes an advantage on
greasy roads. Price of spares is rather higher
than American types. Free-wheeling equipment
is entirely satisfactory.

“Growing up,” the author says, when intro-
ducing his leading character, “in a period when
Australians had begun to feel in themselves
the germ of a new people and to fumble for
words to express themselves, I often wondered
what roots that new psyche was coming from.
Then it struck me that the answer was some-
where in the life of this old man and his
generation. If I could piece together the picture
of that epoch as I had inherited it from him —
the savage deeds, the crude life, the hatred
between men and men and men and country,
the homesickness, the loneliness, the despair
of inescapable exile in the bush; the strange
forms of madness and cruelty; the brooding,
inturned characters; and, joined with this, an
almost fanatic idealism which repudiated the
past and the tyranny of the past and looked
to the future in a new country for a new
heaven and earth, a new justice; on the one
hand the social outcasts, men broken by de-
gradation and suffering, on the other the adven-
turers; blackest pessimism balancing the most
radiant optimism —if I could only see all this,
then I would understand.”
BRIAN PENTON’S
LANDTAKERS
This Year’s Most Powerjul and Compelling
AUSTRALIAN NOVEL
Brian Penton, one of Australia’s best-
known feature-writers and a journalist of
international repute, has written something
entirely new in Australian literature—
something different. In “Landtakers,” the
author sets himself the big theme of
tracing up from its roots that hitherto
elusive thing, the Australian national
character.
“Landtakers” grips the imagination from
the very first page. Its literary quality is
maintained throughout—beautiful prose
is characteristic of the book, no matter
what scene or mood is being portrayed.
In fierce or violent action and in gentle
passages the language is always appro-
priate and never ceases to reflect true
literary craftsmanship.
This brilliant novel deals with the tyranny
of the past and the hope of the future.
It takes a man whose character is sensi-
tive to environment, an Englishman who
hates this new country, and who fights
irritably against its gradual possessing
hold. Here is Australian tradition in the
making, a graphic description of what the
country had the power to do to those
from whom we have sprung. “Land-
takers is the outstanding novel of the
year—it will be talked about, written
about and argued about. Lodge your
order now with your nearest bookseller,

BY DR. H. L. TONKIN.
THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING SILENT.
One of the earmarks of a really first-
class player is his capacity for passing.
If he is getting average cards and a part-
ner who cannot bid. he is content to keep
silence. He knows that it can’t go on for
ever and, unless he gets the intuition that
the time is ripe for a psychic bid, he
remains passive. Yet it is strange how
many good players are encountered who
become fretful and unbalanced under
a barrage of bad hands. Such petulant
players make by far the most dangerous
partners. At some time or other they
will burst out with an overcall which
ruthless opponents will double and set
for the price of two or three rubbers.
This type of bridge player is only at his
best on the attacking hands.
Yet the failing is not uncommon, even
in those regarded as A-grade players,
and becomes much more marked as we
descend the scale. It is especially seen
among the gambling type of player, no
matter whether the stakes be threepence
or a pound a hundred. Some of the
bids are not only indefensible but inex-
plicable ; other bids may be far more
reasonable, but just as costly, owing to
a failure to consider their possible
results. I will give an example of each
bid. The first, I consider, was absolutely
foolish ; the second, not an unreasonable
call, although perhaps a little dangerous
when vulnerable, met with just as severe
a set-back. Both incidents occurred at
the Sydney Bridge Club during the last
week.
In the first, my good friend Dr.
McAdam was partnered by Miss Glynn
Smith, another excellent player. Both of
their opponents were first-class, particu-
larly the one who made the bad bid. I
should assign the actual cause of this
player’s gross lapse to a hand played a
few minutes before on which he and his
partner accepted a penalty of 250 points,
having been “psycheed” out of a small
slam.

both vulnerable, the following hands

North's one-club bid I rather agree
with. Whenever possible, the opening
one n.t. should be avoided. If partner
is very strong in clubs, and has outside
support, he won’t bid more than three
clubs, except on freak hands, unsuitable
for play in three no-trumps. East has
a good pass, and would have done better
to maintain that attitude. South has
nearly a two no-trump response to
North’s club opening, except for the
score. West’s hand, as somebody ex-
pressed it after the debacle, is “just good
enough to lose the rubber.” His partner
had passed, but West evidently thought
there might still be some chance of bluff-
ing the opposition to bid up in spades or
clubs, so he bid two diamonds. North,
knowing his opponent, allowed for the
diamond bid being deceptive, but, as he
could deal with two spades, he doubled.
That East alsb suspected something
is the only excuse for his futuristic two-
heart bid. This was promptly doubled
by Miss Smith, who could see that her
opponents were talking themselves into
trouble. From then on, the massacre
proceeded.
Allowing that West's first bid was
definitely bad, I think his subsequent
three n.t. was little less so. He must see
that, besides the lack of top cards in the
combined hands, there is an obvious
misfit. East’s two hearts, and then sup-
port of the diamonds, imply a shortage
in the black suits, so that any no-trump
contract must be worse than a suit play.
The final doleful bid of four diamonds
was no worse than any which preceded
it. You may think that East-West just
got what they deserved; nevertheless,
bids just as bad get past, even in high-
grade circles. And some much better
bids meet with rather undeserved pun-
ishment.
As an example of the second variety,
take this hand: —
4 —K» Q, 8 > x > x. x
y—x, x, x
4—K, x, x, x
4 —None
Both sides vulnerable.
On your right, North deals and says
“One Club.” What do you do? The
hand contains about five and a half play-
ing tricks, and most would call one spade,
as the player in question did. This was
promptly doubled by South. West took
fright, and made what I think was the
really bad bid of the round. He said
“Two clubs.” After a little hesitation,
this was doubled by North. West’s call
shows the folly of “rescue” bids except
on very remarkable holdings. If your
partner finds himself sandwiched between
two strong hands, and is looking for a
way out, he has his refuge. He can
always use the SOS redouble. Then you
can bid your two clubs or two diamonds.
East, void of the “rescue” suit, had
no choice but to call two spades to avoid
worse disaster. I have seen the most
severe penalties inflicted on partnerships
as a result of this “rescue” habit. The
first bidder is often driven to name a
second suit, hoping to find a fit, and, after
the almost inevitable double, the con-
science-stricken rescuer wriggles back to
the first bid at a higher contract than
before.
However, in this instance, East’s two
spades was the final declaration, and the
position was as follows: —
4~ x
—K, J, 10, 9, x
♦ —A, x, x, x
4~A, Q, x
*-x n ♦-K,Q.8,x,x,x
V— A > X > X w E V-x, x, x
♦ —J, x, x 4~K., x, x. x
4—J. 10, 9, x, x, x ! 4— None
4— A, J, 10, 9, x
¥-Q
♦—Q, X, x
4 —K, x, x, x
The queen of hearts was the opening,
and went to dummy’s ace. On the trump
lead South’s ace put him in to return a
club, trumped by East, and the second
round of spades made the situation only
too clear to all. After North gets in
again with a diamond, South discards
clubs, overtrumps East, and draws the
remaining spades. East takes three tricks,
the partnership suffering a loss of 2000
points, for which, in my opinion, East
is almost entirely blameless. Of course,
they were due to lose 1400 in any case,
but that was on account of a most un-
fortunate distribution. If one is never
going to make an overcall of one on a
hand like East’s, then the principles of
safety can be carried too far. But West’s
call furnishes an excellent example of
the virtue of silence when you have
nothing to say.
A Fair Deal.
A welcome visitor to the Sydney Bridge
Club these last few weeks has been Mr.
J. Saulwick, of Melbourne. He is not only
an excellent contract player but a charm-
ing personality at the table. Before a criti-
cal audience he and Dr. McAdam played
through a long and trying session without
missing a trick in attack or defence.
Some day it may become possible to
obtain a prohibition order against a
chronic “psycher.” Just as a confirmed
drunkard is refused alcohol, so it will be
illegal to supply cards to one of these
gentry when detected and certified.
The revolt against system play is on.
Not much longer will bridge devotees
be confined within a square ring, like
boxers. This is all to the good, but in its
present state of flux it’s rather confusing
to have a partner announce that he plays
the Culbertson one, the official two and
the Sims n.t. all in the one rubber.

“FREQUENCY CONSCIOUSNESS.”
By DON B.KNOCK.
Radio reception has reached a stage
where the term “short wave” has be-
come familiar to the layman. When a
special relay takes place in conjunction
with the 8.8. C. or the British Post Office,
and the programme is rebroadcast by
Australian stations, he knows, rather
vaguely, that it is all done by the agency
of the (to him) mysterious short wave.
Not many years ago engineers were
content to refer for measurement purposes
to the “wave-length” of transmission and
reception, and accepted this as a standard.
It sufficed for a time, for
the reason that the lowest
wave-length in practical
use was in the region of
200 metres. For broad-
casting purposes the band
of wave-lengths used in
Australia is from 200 to
500 metres, and in Europe
from 1000 to 2000 metres
is used additionally. In
the earlier days of Aus-
tralian broadcasting this
latter band was also in use
for stations 2FC, 3LO and 6WF; Either
of these two bands, medium and long
wave, may be covered with ease with a
single tuning coil and variable condenser,
and tuning is not very critical when a
vernier control is used to rotate the con-
denser.
With the development of wave-
lengths below 200 metres, which dates
commercially from 1923, and for which
much credit is due to the pioneer amateur
experimenters, it was quickly realised that
some more accurate standard was neces-
sary for measurement purposes than a
mere statement of wave-length. This
arose from the question of “tuning
speed,” for, when wave-lengths of 40 and
20 metres came into everyday use, the
usual capacity of tuning condenser was
found to be hopelessly oversize for easy
tuning.
The reason for this is that the further
the wave-length goes down the higher is
the oscillation frequency. Thus a small
tuning capacity became necessary, with
a high-ratio vernier adjustment, in order
to approach a semblance of the tuning
The two dials show why the short-wave receiver
needs to be so much sharper in definition than the
broadcast receiver. The band covered by the short-
wave receiver is ten times greater than the other.
ease one experiences when handling a
broadcast receiver.
In due course, “wave-length” went into
discard in the radio laboratory and the
more accurate standard of “frequency in
kilocycles per second” took its place.
The experienced radio engineer thinks
only in terms of frequency, for he has
to make exacting and extremely accurate
calibrations and measurements. The old-
time term “wave-length” is not entirely
discarded, however, for it is convenient
in explaining the nature of short waves
to the inexperienced radio dabbler. He
can visualise readily, after a little ex-
planation, the meaning of wave-length,
whereas “frequency” has him stumped
until he has acquired some experience
in listening on the short-wave bands.
Tuning speed is of major importance
in short-wave reception. The matter at
issue is: How fast does the receiver
cover the frequency (or wave-length)
range, and what is the frequency range
for each plug-in (or switched) coil?
In the case of the broadcast receiver a
range in frequency of from 200 to 600
A comparison of the frequency spectrum in the
broadcast band with the short-wave hand.
metres is 1500 to 500 kilocycles., This
is a “spread” of 1000 kilocycles.
Many modern broadcast receivers have
the dials calibrated both in wave-length
and frequency, and, in the case of “all-
wave” receivers, the short-wave range is
calibrated roughly in wave-length. The
general practice, however, has been, and
still is, to use a dial marked in degrees
reading from oto 100. It is just a con-
venient means of providing an indicator
for reference. A dial could just as easily
have been adopted using the letters of
the alphabet, and recently one British
manufacturer has adopted a 24-hour
clock dial.
If absolute straight-line frequency
could be obtained over the whole dial
this would mean that 100 stations be-
tween 1500 and 500 k.c. could be tuned
in, having a separation of 10 k.c. between
each. This ideal is not realised for the
reason that some broadcasting stations
are so close to the receiver that they take
up more than the 10 k.c. on the dial. Yet,
the modern superheterodyne gets fairly
close to the ideal.
It is natural that, after
studying this broadcast-
frequency range, the new-
comer to short-wave re-
ceivers will consider a coil
for 15 to 30 metres and
get the impression that the
short - wave receiver
doesn’t cover as wide a
band as the broadcast re-
ceiver. Actually, that
small-sized coil covers 10
times the frequency range
of the broadcast receiver
—IO,OOO kilocycles com-
pared to the 1000 cycles
of the broadcast range!
The diagrams illustrate
the point, and the reader
may see clearly just why
a slow tuning speed is
necessary for easy short-
wave tuning. One diagram
shows how little of the
frequency spectrum is used for broad-
casting in comparison with the short-wave
bands, and the other the difference in
frequency coverage when using similar
dials.
Thus it will be seen that it is un-
desirable to use a large-capacity tuning
condenser for high frequencies unless
there is a small vernier tuning cap-
acity in parallel or series, also con-
trolled by a vernier dial. Although this
is a way of overcoming the tuning-speed
problem it is not the best, for the higher
the ratio of capacity to inductance the
less efficient is the tuned circuit. A
stronger signal is obtained with more in-
ductance and less capacity. This can be
overdone with the familiar triode regen-
erative detector, but is fully permissible
with the electron-coupled detector as in
the “Wide-World” receivers designed by
the writer.
The tuning of a short-wave receiver
is naturally so much sharper than the
broadcast receiver that it may lead to
the misconception that it is also more
selective. A poorly designed short-wave
receiver can be just as inselective as a
poorly designed broadcast receiver. As
with broadcasting frequencies, there is
congestion on the short-wave channels
used for international broadcasting, and
it is quite commonplace to find a wireless
telegraph (or telephone) station in Cali-
fornia causing interference with a station
in Europe. This may be the case with
a short-wave receiver using a broadly-
tuned detector, but a more selective kind
of receiver will show a different state of
affairs. The constant short-wave listener
should, from available charts, look up
the stated wave-length of the stations
he logs, and, by using a wave-length-
frequency conversion chart, memorise the
frequency of the stations heard. By
doing this the mind becomes “frequency
conscious,” and in due course one thinks
readily in kilocycles instead of wave-
lengths. To convert wave-length in
metres to frequency in kilocycles divide
300,000 by the number of metres.

“BULLETIN” TEST REVIEW.
( Manufacturers’ products considered worthy of
attention will be regularly reviewed in this section.)
Progress in the development of bat-
tery-operated “all-wave” receivers has
been less speedy than in the case of the
well-established A.C. type. The pro-
blems to be solved have been more diffi-
cult. The design of a battery all-wave
receiver is conditioned by country re-
quirements, which means sensitivity for
daylight reception, rigid battery economy
and mechanical and electrical details call-
ing for a minimum of service.
In The Bulletin radio laboratory a
receiver built by Stromberg-Carlson on

the lines indicated has been tested, and
the results are what could be expected
from a receiver bearing the name of this
pioneer of the superheterodyne in Aus-
tralia.
Filament supply is from a six-volt
source, as the oscillator-modulator is a
6A7 pentagrid, the other valves being
directly-heated two-volt 34’s, 30’s and 19
“Class-B” output. Automatic biasing is
employed, and plate voltage at 180 volts
is taken from four of the largest size 45-
volt B-battery blocks. The drum dial,
which is calibrated, is of a wide, easily-
viewed type, and is used on all tuning
ranges, broadcast and short-wave. The
short-wave circuits are precisely aligned,
and no manual adjustment other than
the main tuning control is provided.
An outstanding feature of all Strom-
berg-Carlson all-wave models is the
unique barrel-type wave-change switch.
This switch is certain and smooth in
action and of the kind least likeiy to
develop contact faults. The “on-off”
switch underneath the tuning control is
the filament battery switch. Being
equipped with an Amplion permagnetic
speaker, the tonal quality from the
“Class-B” audio system is very pleasing.
Although a test in a metropolitan dis-
trict may not be considered an adequate
basis for comment on country perform-
ance, comparison with results obtained
with receivers known to be eminently
successful in the country gives a fair clue
to merits in this respect.
There is nothing lacking in the Strom-
berg-Carlson 604 in the way of sensi-
tivity and general broadcast performance,
and operation on the short-wave side
calls for no more effort than on the
broadcast range. Efficiency on all waves
is very high, and in its attractive cabinet
this receiver, at £47 17s. 6d., represents
excellent value for the battery user re-
quiring a modern all-wave radio receiver
featuring operating economy with other
essentials.
About Those Talks.
A lot of energy, to say nothing of fees,
is wasted in broadcasting talks which
the average listener refuses to hear. The
speakers have something worth while to
say—the talks editor sees to that —but
many of them do not realise that their
audience is composed of very shy birds.
The best-qualified speaker is useless if
no one listens to him. A good talk, well
delivered, painlessly instils knowledge
into people who have stopped educating
themselves, but a bad talk, or one badly
delivered, only helps to propagate the
idea that all talks are boring.
When people go to hear an actor or
a lecturer they usually stay to the bitter
end. They have paid their money and
always hope, even against hope, that they
will get something to repay them. Sheer
inertia will often keep them in their
seats, especially when there is nowhere
else to go. The listener-in has only to
turn a knob in order to obtain what he
considers better fare.
When children are playing noisily and
other members of the household talking
or wrangling, the listener’s environment
is not ideal. Someone is sure to be insist-
ently demanding music instead of talks.
The listener must have something definite
to repay him for listening. The speaker’s
words must come through clearly and
distinctly, so that the listener hears and
understands without effort. The voice
must be pleasing. A whining intonation,

indistinct diction or a patronising manner
invites a prompt switch to another
station.
Many speakers talk as if they were
bent on cramming in the greatest pos-
sible number of words in the shortest
time. A reader is helped by the familiar
appearance of the words, and he can cast
his eyes back over any obscure para-
graph. The facial expression and ges-
tures of a flesh-and-blood speaker help
out his audience. The listener-in has no
such aids, and once he loses the thread
it is gone for ever. A distinct pause
must allow each sentence to sink in. It
is extraordinary how many speakers em-
phasise the unimportant and slur the im-
portant words where right emphasis is
doubly necessary.
Suppose the man at the receiving end
has begun to listen to a talk, he is by
no means securely caught. He is pro-
bably saying to himself: “Well, I will
give this fellow a go.” He expects the
speaker to know his subject, and has no
use for modest or mock-modest apologies
on that score. He is supremely indifferent
as to who a new speaker may be. He
either likes him or he does not. A long
string of academic titles will not make
him listen a moment longer than he
chooses. But once he has tasted and
appreciated a talk he will look for more
from the same speaker.
A good title is excellent bait to attract
the listener, but he must be given some-
thing really interesting right at the be-
ginning to rivet his attention. He cannot
follow long and involved sentences. They
must be short and clear. Everything must
be clean-cut and direct. The listener
wants to be talked to in an
conversational way. “Orating” or “elo-
cuting” is fatal. A talk is a talk. It
should not sound as if it were being
read ; but, since it is read, there is no
excuse for “er —er” and hesitancies of
that kind. Loud breathing in front ol
the microphone is objectionable. It
sounds like the air intake of an old car-
engine.

City Short-wave Explorations.
At 8 a.m. many foreign stations have
been coming in at good strength. One
of the best has been DJA Zeesen, on
31.38 metres, which provides excellent
entertainment. FYA Paris, on 25.63, has
also been heard, but not nearly so clearly
as later in the day. The Empire station
GSF on 19.2 has been very clear. It has
provided an entertaining news service
from 8.15 to 8.30 a.m.
On two Saturdays I heard an Ameri-
can station working Japan from 1.45
until 3 p.m. The call-sign of the trans-
mitting station sounded like KOW, loca-
tion in California, and wave-length about
19 metres. The Japanese station was re-
ferred to as JVF, location not identified.
Reception of the American station was
very clear ; it appeared to be conducting
a series of tests with Japan. An interest-
ing session listened to every Sunday for
some time past is one which WBXK Pitts-
burg, U.S.A., on 25.25, gives from 2 to 2.15
p.m. During this session the latest short-
wave news is announced, particulars of
coming events and alterations in wave-
lengths and times. Signal strength is
considerable at that time of the day, and
every word can be followed with ease.
It was interesting to hear from this source
that the Australian stations VK2ME,
VK3ME and VK3LR had been well re-
ceived in America. There is no doubt
these short-wave stations give Australia a
lot' of publicity.
American amateurs have still been
heard very well during the afternoons
from 2 to 5. Some of the strong-
est lately have been W7BUF on 80,
and W6CIN, K6BAZ, W9LD and W2TP
on 20. Reception from K6BAZ was so
clear that the siren of a passing fire-
engine could be heard. The new Japan-
ese station, reported as JBN has been
identified as JVN, wave-length 27.9.
Both the Empire stations have been
coming in very well during the after-
noons, and on a recent Sunday it was a
surprise to hear GSB and GSD reopen
at 6.30 p.m. Signals were very weak,
however, and quickly faded out. Pro-
bably a special test transmission.

Country Short-wave Explorations.
Signal strength has been poor in the
mornings up to 8.30, after which there
is improvement. At time of writing the
best period on 25m. is from 2 p.m. to
3 p.m. FYA and WBXK close down at
3 p.m. The 8.8. C. transmissions on both
31m. and 25m. are not so good as they
were two weeks ago. The best lately has
been the 25m. station GSD, though this
weakens after 4 p.m.
There is a most interesting session
from WBXK (25.25 m.) between 2 and
2.30 p.m., the first half being devoted to
a general discussion on short-wave
stations and the second to the broadcast
band. This is a regular session, and now
that WBXK is coming over well it is
worth listeners’ attention.
Late night reception on the 25m. band
has been still disappointing, though the
latest cricket and tennis scores were
heard hot from the grounds concerned
through GSE.
The 80m. amateur band has been full
of interest, noise level being low and
signals strong. One can always get a
laugh if ZLIFI is about. I have heard
several Americans and a Dutch East
Indiaman between 6.30 and 7 a.m. on this
band.
The 20m. amateur band was excep-
tionally good during a recent week-end,
several Americans being comparable to
locals in speaker volume. Some were
working VK5s and reporting good recep-
tion, though they were using “9 toobs.”
RVIS on 70m. has been putting over
some splendid music about 8 p.m., and
should be well worth tuning for. The
49m. band has been rather poor, even
the D.E.I. stations being weak until very
late at night.

actual image received at Film House,
London, from the Baird ultra-short-wave
television transmitter at the Crystal
Palace. Definition is remarkable, the
number of scanning lines employed being
180 to the inch. The pictures are re-
ported to be perfectly steady and com-
parable with cinema projection, the fre-
quency, 25 pictures per second, being the
same. Despite the fact that the receiv-
ing location is in a position in London
where machine static is as bad as any-
where else, the pictures were entirely
free from any such trouble, and remained
clear during an hour’s demonstration.
The use of a 6-metre wave-length was
responsible for this, proving that ultra-
short waves are an immediate solution
of the problems of local television
broadcasting.

The difference in aircraft radio of to-
day and 1917 is a big one. Telegraphy
equipment, using “Sterling” lin. spark
coils, was the complement for the bomber
or artillery “spotter.” The writer had
occasion to dislike the system at Mudros
in 1918. when engaged with an armorer
placing a 1121 b. bomb in the rack be-
neath the fuselage. The observer touched
his Morse key to test the gear. The
aerial weight, hanging close behind
writer’s neck, passed the spark discharge
through both men struggling with the
bomb. The seconds that passed whilst
they were wondering whether the spark
had acted on the fulminate of mercury
detonator were an eternity. A few thou-
sand volts were ignored by that detonator,
luckily for them.

He was recently promoted to sergeant.

Universal (A.C. or D.C.) radio re-
ceivers are receiving attention in Europe.
Such design is not new to Australia, but
the valves used in the European versions
are. The “Ostar-Ganz” valves are made
with high-voltage heaters, running direct
from the 240-volt A.C. or D.C. mains.

Short-wave oscillators are now used
extensively for healing purposes. The
patient is placed between two electrodes,
and abscesses heal and disappear, whilst
bacteria are killed. A striking effect is
that a considerable rise in temperature
of the patient’s body takes place, which
helps to destroy bacteria rapidly. It is
claimed that chronic rheumatism can
be cured by ultra-short-wave application.

MORE THAN JUST MAKING VALVES
During the past ten years of radio, more
Mullard Valves have been sold than any other
make. This definitely proves two things:
that Mullard Master Valves must be the
finest radio valves obtainable, and that ten
years’ preference by the radio public has
been maintained by continued research and
experimenting. Write for Booklet.

was substituted for the usual air-cored
coils in a receiver designed for use in
cars, and without any other changes in
the receiver the actual measured overall
gain increased four times, with a notice-
able improvement in the signal-to-noise
ratio. Australian radio manufacturers
might probably consider iron-cored coils
for special T.R.F. receivers for the
country.

Whilst the receiver side of radio has
received full attention in the last few
years aerials have not. Too often is a
first-class receiver connected to an aerial
which is neither one thing nor the other.
The “all-wave” receiver calls for some-
thing efficient in the way of aerials, and
a campaign by manufacturers, dealers
and servicemen to encourage users to
instal well-elevated and insulated aerials
will be to the benefit of all con-
cerned. Unless the short-wave side of
the receiver is fitted with pre-amplifica-
tion the average indoor picture-rail aerial
is little short of useless.

Thirteen years ago Enrico Caruso died,
but his voice remained to the world on
records. Sound recording in early days
had not attained the perfection of to-day,
but engineers have worked wonders on
Caruso’s recordings of 28 years ago.
They brought out all the power and
quality concealed in the old grooves and
re-recorded them, adding a new and
larger orchestral accompaniment. Time
was turned back at the Metropolitan
Opera House, New York, recently when
the voice of Caruso sounded again in
all its power and brilliance in the hall
that witnessed his greatest triumphs.

Transmitter Technique.
Economical Modulation.
Side by side with the rapid develop-
ment of receivers, telephony transmitters
are undergoing improvement. New
methods of modulation are appearing,
including, notably, the “suppressor-grid”
system. The grid-control method known
as “Telefunken” is by no means a recent
development, and is used in Australia
by many amateur transmitters and by a
Sydney broadcasting station. The ad-
vantage is that of economy, there being
no modulator-plate load as in the con-
stant-current method (choke control).
In experimental work, the writer has
applied the “Class-B” type 53 valve
(with improvement) as a modulator. (See
diagram).
The two triode sections of this twin-
valve are used as a single triode. Fully 85
p.c. modulation may be obtained, the
modulator being applied (in this case)
to the buffer amplifier preceding the
final stage. With a sensitive microphone
no special amplification is necessary for
normal voice volume. Screening of the
lead from modulator cathode to the grid
of the modulated valve is necessary to
suppress hum from the heater trans-
former. Any of the directly-heated
Class-B ’ valves would be suitable for
battery use.
D.B.K.
A Short-wave Disadvantage.
A peculiarity of short-waves is the
‘‘skip” effect, where the signal disap-
pears at relatively close distances from
the transmitter and reappears at much
greater distances. Two police-patrolmen
in a U.S.A. city, after returning to their
radio-equipped car, heard their car
number being called to proceed to a
location “on Main-street.” Hoping they
hadn’t left the car long, they “stepped
on the gas” and found Main-street
devoid of crooks, gangsters, kidnappers
or anything calling for the attention of
the law. After cruising round, they
telephoned Police H.Q., and were told
that the call came from another city.
They were advised to keep their earmuffs
off and stay in their car.
Short-wave Pros and Cons.
“Crowded Dials.”
Many newcomers to short-wave recep-
tion make the error of using too large
a tuning condenser. The effect of this
is indicated in the sketch of the dial on
the left. Wave-lengths come too close
together on the dial. The wave-length
disposition, with a correct inductance-
capacity ratio, is shown on the right,
where signals are well spaced and tuning
is rendered much easier.
“Howling Detectors.”
One of the most frequent and annoy-
ing experiences of the enthusiast who
builds his first short-wave receiver, simple
though it may be in construction, is that
of a persistently howling detector valve.
The howl may be continuous, or it may
occur just at that point described as the
“threshold of oscillation.”
The regenerative two- or three-valve
receiver is the kind the beginner usually
makes his start with. If such a receiver
has a smoothly and silently controlled
detector, as much, if not more, enjoy-
ment can be derived from it as from a
more expensive superhet. But if this
receiver has the aggravating symptom of
“threshold howl” it is little short of use-
less, for the detector cannot be used in
anything like a sen-
sitive condition.
Symptoms and
Remedy.
Sometimes this
howl persists over
only a small portion
of the tuning range,
and often over more
than half the dial.
The trouble is
caused invariably by
the amplified energy
in the plate circuit
of the valve being
fed back to the
grid ; an instance of
“R.F. feedback.” A
rearrangement of the
layout of the valve
socket, R.F. choke,
grid condenser and
leak, or audio coup-
ling, may result in
banishing this feed-back, but, where this
fails, here are a few suggestions covering
remedies:
(a) A potentiometer across the detector-valve
filament leads, with the moving arm connected
to the grid leak (Q. and A., B. 27/6/’34,
No. 18). This gives the grid of the valve its
correct potential.
( b ) Reversing the primary connections to one
or both audio-frequency transformers.
(c) Extra by-passing of the detector-plate
circuit.
(d) A different value of grid leak and grid
condenser.
(e) A change of detector valve.
(f) A .25 meg. resistor (or .5) across the
secondary of the first audio transformer.
(g) A .1 to .5 meg. resistor between the grid
of the first audio valve and the transformer
secondary, as illustrated.
(h) An R.F. choke in the same position.

plate lead>

D.B.K.
The Q. and A. Column.
Am interested in your “Wide-World Three”
(B. 20/6/’34) to replace the three-valve I have
in use. Selectivity is my problem. Is the
“Wide-World Three” more selective than my
present receiver; diagram submitted ? —35.
No; your present receiver includes a stage
of T.R.F., and is more selective. Keep to the
T.R.F. for broadcast reception, but alter the
detector for electron-coupled operation, as in
the “Wide-World Three” diagram. With
“Class-B” after this you should have an ex-
cellent receiver. Separately tuned R.F. would
be an advantage.
Is any special R.F. choke necessary for coup-
ling the T.R.F. stage by the shunt-feed method
in a short-wave receiver ? —36.
The choke should be designed for work over
the short-wave bands, but the usual slot-wound
choke as used in broadcast receivers has been
found quite satisfactory. R.C.S. Radio
(Sydney) makes special three-section short-wave
chokes with pigtailed connections.
Enclosed is a circuit diagram of a D.C.
eliminator which, when connected to set, seems
to require alteration to
H.T. voltage when dif-
ferent stations are tuned
in. Is it wired cor-
rectly ? —3B.
Difficult to tell from
your hurriedly drawn
sketch. You seem to
have mixed wiring up
with components, and
there appears to be no
positive lead connected
from the filter choke
output to the condenser
bank. Draw the dia-
gram again, more legibly.
Enclosed is the diagram of a crystal set I am
using, with a suggested addition of a one-stage
audio amplifier. Is the addition theoretically
correct 3—40.
Quite correct. You can use any general-
purpose two-, four- or six-volt valve as the
amplifier.
A MODERN BROADCASTING “NERVE CENTRE.” The control-
room at Broadcasting House, London, headquarters of the B.B.C.
I am using an all-wave receiver and often
hear amateurs using telephony say they
are “pleased to QSO.” What does this gib-
berish mean? —41.
“QSO” is telegraphic short for “communi-
cate.” Such abbreviations should be confined
to telegraph working. Plain English is best
when using the spoken word.
Can you supply particulars of the construc-
tion of a “velocity” type of microphone ? I
have heard that this type has a particularly
low noise level. —37.
This type is in extensive use in America, and
is used in Sydney by station 2UW. The dia-
grams show construction from the frame of an
old car magneto.
Recently 1 built a 4 / 5-valve preselector
superheterodyne which does not work satis-
factorily. I suspect the ganged variable con-
denser. How can I test this ? —46.
Connect a 50-watt house lamp with an
adaptor in series with two flexible leads from
a light socket. If the lamp lights when the
two leads are touched, one to the frame, and
the other to each stator section in turn, the
condenser has a short between rotor and
stator. The tuned circuits must be discon-
nected to make this test. The test can also
be made by sound with a dry cell and buzzer.
Rotate the condenser to test it in every position.
(1) Is a license necessary to have a QSL
card printed ? (2) Enclosed is the circuit dia-
gram of a short-wave receiver. Is this arranged
for maximum gain ? —42.
(1) No. (2) It should have very high gain,
but great care must be taken with the screen-
ing of the two T.R.F. stages to prevent inter-
locking.
1 wish to wind a transformer for use with
a small two-amp. valve rectifier. With 230
volts A.C. in the primary, and using a core
2\ inches in section, what number of turns
and gauge of wire will be required for the
primary and secondary ? —43.
3450 turns of 38 enamelled copper wire for
the primary. You do not state the required
voltage for the filament winding, so cannot
advise, but this can be easily determined by
trial and error. Use 22 gauge D.C.C. for the.
secondary.
Enclosed is the circuit diagram of a B
eliminator. I have a 15 -watt pilot light con-
nected across the primary of the powe >• trans-
former and have wondered if this will have
any effect on the operation of the eliminator.
It is merely an indicator to show that the power
is switched on. Also, I have a 2.5-volt torch
bulb in series with the H.T. secondary centre-
tap. Will this have any effect on voltage or
current output ? —44.
The pilot light will have no effect of any
kind other than its intended function, and the
bulb used as a fuse will not, owing to its low
resistance, affect the output from the eliminator.
A few months ago I made your “Wide-
World Two,” which is everything you claim.
I have passed many enjoyable hours listening
to Australian and M.L. amateurs, but please
tell me why many of them punctuate speech
with what sounds like “Hi, Hi” ? —4B.
An unnecessary little affectation designed to
give an impression of familiarity with tele-
graphy, and of an experience that antedates
wireless telephony. The letters Hi are an ab-
breviation adopted years ago by American
cable operators to denote laughter or amuse-
ment. Amateur transmitters use it extensively,
but they should have enough faith in .their
microphones to credit them with being able
to reproduce a natural laugh.
CORRECTION.
In the circuit diagram for query 32 (B.
4/7/’34) illustrating a single-valve A.C. short-
wave adaptor, the words “aerial terminal on
receiver” and “H.T. from receiver” should
be transposed. The plate voltage is connected
via the 30,000 ohm resistor.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
The G.N. Hurdle victory of Prismatic
was thoroughly deserved. The Rossendale
gelding could beat his rivals again, singly
or collectively, on any day of the week
over three miles. Up to perhaps a little
more than two miles Baanya might out-
gallop and outjump Prismatic ; but, as
in the National of 1933, Baanya failed
to stay.
Hynes was compelled to go to
the front with the Tasmanian, who pulls
hard. History repeated itself ; for the
second successive season Baanya knocked
up. He missed a place in a field of nine
horses, two of whom failed to finish.
Our Comet clouted his rider out of the
saddle at an early stage ; Laniroi came
a purler at the last flight. Prismatic
made a bad blunder seven furlongs from
home ; apart from that, his jumping was
good. He landed a little awkwardly over
the last lot of battens, but was really
untroubled to score by 2\ lengths from
Silvion, with Prime Seal 34 lengths
farther away.
Cecil God by, who experienced lean
years after Purser’s Caulfield Cup, has
struck his gait once more as a trainer.
In the spring he landed the Caulfield
Cup with Gaine Carrington, and the
Moonee Valley Cup with Peter Jackson.

These horses were raced by J. A.
Phillips, a member of the Paddock ring.
Phillips also owns Prismatic. Three
Nationals have been won by men named
Phillips: in 1890 Ellerslie scored for the
late Bob Phillips ; in 1916 Jullundur did
the trick for Eli Phillips, who has been
licensee of a number of Melbourne
hotels.
The track was dead, and Prismatic did
well to cover the three miles of the
National in 5.39|. This is 9ysec. slower
than the record established by Belar 12
months ago, but until Fiscom set 5.35|
in 1921 the record was 5.41.
“O.B.”: Frank Douglas, the rider of
Prismatic, is a native of Kensington,
Sydney, and as a youth was apprenticed
to J. Phoenix. Even as an apprentice he
rode over hurdles and steeples. He is a
dashing rider who was not afraid to
school “green” horses at Randwick when
other jockeys were onlookers.
Perseverance had its reward when E.
J O’Dwyer annexed the Maiden Hurdle
with Mystic Peak. Sent out from Eng-
land two seasons ago by Clark and
Robinson, this gelding was allotted Bst.
21b. in the last Metrop. and 7st. 121 b.
in the Melbourne Cup, with correspond-
ingly heavy imposts in other valuable
handicaps; but he proved a washout as
a galloper. O’Dwyer put him to jump-
ing as a last resort. On Saturday he
shouldered one hurdle and clouted
another with his off leg. However, the
Britisher is game, and he wore down
Eric Connolly’s supposed cert., Dark
Man, to win by half a length. Mystic
Peak is an aspirant for the Australian
Hurdle honors next month.
Young A. R. Musgrave did the pen-
cillers a rare turn by saddling up the
conqueror of the favorite, Great Don, in
the first division of the Iramoo Welter.
Whereas Great Don figured at 2 to 1,
Practice (Rosewing—Theory) was quoted
at 100 to 3, and paid nearly 45 to 1 on
the tote. Second division of the race
went to Prostration, from A. D. Web-
ster’s string. The stipes investigated the
running of Prostration as compared with
his form at Caulfield a fortnight before ;
they accepted Webster’s explanation.
Great Star' the St. Albans stud stal-
lion, was much in evidence. Two of his
progeny, Star Lover and Triteleia, ran
first and second in the juvenile handi-
cap, while Glideaway carried Frank
Dempsey to victory in the Winter Handi-
cap. Glideaway is in the same stable as
Prismatic.
The Grand National Steeplechase
does not promise to be any more excit-
ing than the first “leg” of the big jumping
double. Precocious, whose success at
Williamstown on June 30 induced the
belief that he was back to best form,
gave a discouraging display in the V.R.C.
Kensington Steeplechase. It looked like
picking up money to back E. Y. Sheil’s
prad at 5 to 4, and when Precocious took
charge half a mile from home McShort-
odds commenced to utter his familiar
moan about punters having “backed only
one horse.” The situation changed drama-
tically. Precocious tired to nothing when
challenged in the straight and could not
gain even a share of the place money.
Prince Flaviol (20 to 1), who is not
engaged in the cross-country classic,
cantered past the judge eight lengths in
advance of Boy Blue, with Widgiewa
third. Royal Visitor got round on this
occasion, but he made one bad blunder.
Precocious now being discredited, Red-
ditch may have only Trafalable to fear
on Saturday, though Woodlace, from
S.A., has a fair number, of admirers.
The Bulletin expects Redditch to win
from Trafalable and Woodlace.
H* 4?
Having her first run for six months
or more, Golden Gate was the medium
of a spectacular plunge in the first divi-
sion of the Flying Handicap at Victoria
Park. From eights she was backed to
favoritism at threes. Her party lost its
money ; the mare found Le Legion (8 to
1) too solid in the run home. She was
beaten by two lengths, with Zeus a fair
third.
The second division went to the Maori-
land-bred 14.2 pony Valoria (14 to 1),
now in his eighth year. The little old
fellow finished too solidly for Wee Jock
and the Newcastle Maid Mary; the
favorite, Orpah, just missed a place. In
the third division, Sly Boots (7 to 2) won
easily from Cheer Mag and Rackets.
His dam, Cool Lady, was a fine sprinter
in her day.
Long stretches had to be negotiated
in the Victoria Park Handicap, 10 fur-
longs and 121 yards. This was thought
to be in favor of Version, whose Rand-
wick form was good; however, after
opening at evens he eased to threes, start-
ing at 5 to 2. There was no excuse for
his defeat, as he had the run of the race ;
Britt had the whip on him at the turn.
Winrose (5 to 1) outstayed Mountain
View and Semmak. She runs her best
races at V.P., where she is trained by
Landrigan, who has also done well with
Loyal Verde, Royal Park and Scooter.
Maitland-owned and -trained Cer-
cello, who has 7st. 51b. in the Epsom,
won the first division of the Welter in
convincing style. He was backed from
fives to threes. Prowler essayed to lead
all the way, but it was apparent a long
way from home that Cercello, who car-
ries the Sir Duninald colors, had his
measure. Ranchero was third, just ahead
of Baltimore, who was last away and is
worth following.
Hathalie (6 to 1) had to be ridden
right out to score in the second division,
the odds-on Multigris being a poor third.
He should have won, but got into a lot
of trouble. Roman Wall took the third
heat at fours, the favorite Chuquisaca
missing a place.
Moorefield-trained Lin Erin, a plain-
looking gelding by Treclare from Liena,
by Tressady from Brattle, is bred to
gallop. He won the first division of the
Nursery at eights, beating Short Wave
and Rose Gem rather easily. The second
division was never in doubt—Richard
Wootton’s Satelles colt Neat Star gave
a brilliant exhibition of galloping to
win from Affluence and the favorite, Pan-
handle, who is not as good as he looks.
Young Hickey rode the winner, and it is
strange that such a good horseman does
not get more chances to show his skill.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Tom Lurich apd Haban Singh had an-
other meeting at Leichhardt on Satur-
day night. It enabled readers of U.S.
newspapers to understand why these
affairs must be advertised as “entertain-
ments” in that country. Singh was far too
speedy and slippery for Lurich. But
in the fourth round they rolled under
the ropes and were apparently knocked
unconscious by colliding with the piano.
The Russian had sufficient sense to re-
gain the mat unaided, and Singh, still
asleep, was adjudged to have lost.
Woodfull’s Men
Winning the toss and batting first on
a slow and easy wicket at Old Trafford,
England set Australia a formidable task
in the third Test, when Wyatt rather be-
latedly closed at 3.50 p.m. on Saturday
with 9 down for 627. This is England’s
highest Test score at home and only
nine short of its best in Australia.
The weather was clear and hot,
and when Southern Lancashire is
hot the air is like a steam bath. The
Australian bowlers were like chewed rags
toward the end of each day, and small
wonder. Conditions did not prevent
O’Reilly putting up one of the greatest
bowling feats in the history of the Tests
—59 overs, 9 maidens, 189 runs, 7
wickets. Tired as they were, the Aus- <
tralians lost only a wicket for 136 at the
close of play.
Walters and Sutcliffe had 68 up before :
the amateur went to O’Reilly for a well-
made 52. There was a sensation when
the same bowler dismissed Wyatt for }
a blob, and the Lion’s tail dropped 180 ;
degrees when the North Sydney man sent ;
Hammond back for 4 —3 for 72. That .
was the end of it for Australia. Hendren (
began to score fast. Sutcliffe was solid ;
to 63, when Chipperfield snared him in j
the slips, as usual, off O’Reilly. Ley- ,
land and Hendren settled down to a
long partnership which wore out the
scanty bowling reserves. Hendren was ;
the first to go for 132. Ames joined the
Yorkshireman, and more runs came. Ley- ;
land went at 153, caught by Barnett ;
fielding in the deep for the sick Brad- j
man, Bromley having taken - Chipper- (
field’s place. By this the score was 482.'
Hopwood, the local laad, came and went
for 2. Ames was caught by Ponsford
off Grimmett for 72—the South Austra-
lian’s only wicket—and then Allen and
Verity walloped the fagged-out bowlers
till Allen was bowled by McCabe for 61.
Even Clark, a hopeless dud with the bat,
kept his wicket up until Verity had
reached 60 and the innings was closed.
In spite of the huge score, the wicket
lasted well, for, after Ponsford had gone
for 12, McCabe and Brown batted
confidently against fast and slow bowlers
alike. Allen was very off color with the
ball, and Clark’s.fast left-hand stuff wasn’t
troublesome. As he had done in India,
he cut up the pitch considerably. At
stumps Brown was 56 and McCabe 55,
both n.o. Hammond took Ponsford’s
wicket.

Melbourne’s big League game on
Saturday was at Geelong, where 16,500
parted with £4lO for getting a ducking
and casual glimpses of 36 mudlarks.
Naturally, play was anyhow, Richmond’s
high marking being useless against Gee-
long’s ground play, while systematic pass-
ing was impossible. Defenders on both
sides showed up best—Todd and Hickey
for the Seasiders and Sheahan and Mur-
doch for Richmond. Geelong won with
55 to 33. There was a 10,000 crowd at
the M.C.G., where Collingwood found
Melbourne a stiffer proposition than
anticipated. Determined play, with good
backing-up on ’Wood’s side, was met by
better position play and speed on the
part of the Red Legs, who were four
points ahead near full time. Then Kyne
snapped the ball through as the bell rang,
giving Collingwood the game by two
points—6s to 63. At St. Kilda the lighter
and speedier Essendons worried the locals
up to lemon-time, but tired in the last
term, losing chiefly through bad kicking
—56 to Saints’ 74. Carlton held Foot-
scray comfortably throughout—lo 7 to
83 ; and Fitzroy similarly bettered Haw-
thorn—99 to 79. At North Melbourne
South had a day out. South 138 points,
North 46 was the record.
The North v. South match held as a
trial for the selection of the All-Black
team for Australia was played at Auck-
land on Saturday and ended in an 11-11
draw. Twenty-live players were selected
for the trip; and of these H. Smith,
Griffiths, Hadley, Lambourne, Leeson,
Mackenzie, King, Kawea Mataira —the
only Maori —Andrews and Holder are
new men to come this way.
Rugby Union Club results at the week-
end were: Manly 10, Northern Suburbs
3 ; Randwick 11, Drummoyne 6 (replay);
University 13, E.S. 5; W.S. 13, Parra-
matta 9.

Saturday’s round of Sydney’s G.P.S.
football competition provided a surprise
defeat of St. Joseph’s—the first in com-
petition matches for five years—by
’View: a try and a penalty goal to three
tries, one converted, and two penalty
goals.
* * * :|:
N.S.W. and Queensland Rugby Leaguers
met in Brisbane, the game ending in a
25-all draw. The finish was a thriller.
Ma led by 5 points, when Mahon crossed
after a great run just on the bell and
Gilbert added the extra points. It was
an up and down go, with both sides scor-
ing freely and little defensive work in
evidence.
In the Sydney League games, South
Sydney was beaten 18-7 by St. George.
Balmain won from Newtown by 24-15
and Eastern Suburbs headed North
Sydney 20-14. A weak Western Suburbs
team had no trouble with the comic-
opera University side, winning 25-11.

Woodfull’s Men
The Australians made a fairly easy
job of Surrey, ninth on the county
championship list, in their second meet-
ing at the Oval, though neither side
showed anything very brilliant in the
batting. Australia replied to Surrey’s
first knock of 175 with an unimpressive
251, though Ponsford batted well for
85, and Kippax got going at last to score
the half-hundred. Medium-fast bowler
Allom, here with the M.C.C. amateurs
in 1929-30, bowled well to take 4 for 60.
Surrey’s second try yielded 184, Gregory
again playing a sound innings for
48 and Brown hitting judgmatically
for 46. Grimmett and McCabe took
four wickets each in the first Surrey in-
nings, and in the second Fleetwood-Smitn
(3-48) and Grimmett (5-33) did the
damage. With 108 to get to win Australia
lost Brown, Ponsford, Bromley and Dar-
ling cheaply. Bradman played a reassur-
ing knock for 61 n. 0., and the tourists
won by six wickets.
* * !> *
“Aunt Sally”: The success of the dark
horse of the Australian team, Chipper-
field, has drawn the attention of cricket
addicts away from the meritorious per-
formances of Barnett, selected as second
’keeper. The snowy-headed chap had
shown himself a batsman of class in
Australia, and in England has made the
most of nearly every chance given him.
Going in late, his highest has been 61
n. 0., while his average for 12 innings up
to the third Test is 35 —ahead of Kippax,
Darling and Bromley, all accredited
batsmen. Better than that, Barnett has
made his runs with the greatest confid-
ence, and if any more of the better-fancied
batsmen continue to fail he should be
well worth trying in a Test. Cricket fol-
lowers have short memories. How many
recall that before he took the gloves
Barnett was a brilliant outfield and first
represented Victoria as 12th man chiefly
on this account?
* * * *
“Kennington”: In view of the failure
of many much better-advertised batsmen
it seems worth the English selectors’ while
to give R. J. Gregory, of Surrey, a trial.
Last season he topped the thousand runs
for Surrey and took 45 wickets, while
he is a magnificent field. The all-rounder
was included in the team for India under
Jardine, and did well there. So far he has
not been noticed outside the county side.
His record in two matches against the
Australians is not approached by any
other professional. He scored 116 and
59 n.o. in the first encounter, and in the
second, when his mates were skittled by
Grimmett and co., 48 and 48.
* * * H=
“Canny Lad”: The management of
the Australian Eleven has bumped an old
grievance, the fact that the tourists get
nothing from the presence of county
members at the county matches. The Aus-
tralians’ only share in the cash takings
is at the gates, and in case of smaller
counties these are just chicken-feed, most
of the attendance being composed of
ground members. Furthermore, when-
ever the coming of an Australian Eleven
is heralded, the membership list jumps
like a thermometer in Jehannum. Next
season the batch of resignations snows
the secretary under.
* * * #
“Aigburth”: The circumstances of the
second Test have revived the contention
put forward some years ago that, to
equalise the luck of the game as much
as possible, the result of the toss in the
opening Test should settle the choice of
innings for the whole series, each side
making the decision in turn after that.
It is doubtful if the innovation proposed
would make much difference. In the
Test battles to date England has won the
toss 65 times and Australia 66, so the
old method can hardly be improved on.
Footbrawl
“Fitzcray”: One would have thought
that with the huge crowds they draw
Melbourne football clubs would be well-
to-do at least. Wages and elaborate
training costs are so high, however, that,
save in a few instances, the contrary is
the case. Two of the leading Melbourne
League clubs are seeking a characteristi-
cally Australian way out of their
troubles. Each week they are taking a
ss. ticket in a sweep in the hope that
Lady Luck will look their way and smile.
* * * *
“Hotham”: Glenhuntly, a club in the
Vic. amateur association, set out to play
Kingsville. The game was so willing
that the ump. had to stop it several
times, while the spectators also fur-
nished material for comment. A Glen-
huntly v.-p. was donged by a Kings-
ville enthusiast and another supporter
knocked down with a piece of wood
and booted into unconsciousness. Going
off the ground the Glenhuntly players
were mobbed, and a Zambuk Daniel who
ventured into the Kingsville den to see to
the unconscious man was also passed a
couple. The result of this very sporting
afternoon was that Glenhuntly and two
other clubs have declined the honor of
again playing on the Kingsville ground
at any price.
* * *
“Stand Off”: An unpleasing feature
of the recent visit of the Queensland
Rugby Union team to Sydney was the
brazen attitude of the Sydney daily press
—with one exception—in covering up
the incompetence of their representatives
with the most fulsome praise. Only the
anger of the gods prevented the Ma
“Wotcher lookin’ like that for, partner?”
“I’m thinkin out a tombstone inscription for y'”
State from winning the first game—in
which it was overmastered from start to
finish —while the brilliant showing of the
“Colts” in the second match, which the
weary visitors were content to win by a
3-1 margin, proved conclusively that the
State is lousy with talent. In cold truth,
on their form in Sydney, at least, and in
a lesser degree on their Brisbane show-
ing, the Welshmen would be dashed well
served if they had five men in the Aus-
tralian side against the All Blacks,
Queensland and Victoria making up the
balance.
* * * *
“Past Grammar”: The Queensland
R.U. team which played N.S.W. in
Sydney afforded some interesting ex-
amples of heredity. D. J. McLean, the
Wallaby winger, is the son of D.J., senior,
who also represented Bananaland and
Australia. V. Dore, a forward, has for
dad Mick Dore, one of the best scrum-
halves Queensland and Australia have
known, while an uncle, E. Dore, played
for the State against N.S.W. and Great
Britain in 1904. L. Dixon, one of the
reserves, is a nephew of E. Dixon, who
figured for Queensland and Australia
against Ma and G.B. that same year.
He H« He
“Five Ways”: S. Ryan, who came to
Sydney with the Queensland R.U. foot-
ballers as the State representative on the
Australian selection committee, was a
member of the A.I.F. team that won
all its matches for the King’s Cup against
the Dominions, but was downed by the
R.A.F. and England. Of the 16 matches
played overseas 12 were won. Back in
Australia the side didn’t drop one of
its eight games.
* * * *
“Five-eighth”: The usual intensive pro-
paganda about the hugeness and ferocity
of the coming All-Blacks is now rolling
over the Tasman like a destroyer smoke-
screen. Australians, with memories of the
past, are recalling that the bigger they
are the harder they fall, and making due
preparations. The leviathans will be
landed in Sydney on July 28, and open
against N.S.W. on the Sydney C. G. on
August 4. Prices are Is. 6d. to the
ground for grown-ups and 3s. to the
stands. Children will pay 9d. and 2s.
* * t- *
“Richmond”: Rugby Union is now
soundly established in Melbourne, and is
making steady headway in Adelaide. Vic-
toria is visiting South Australia for a
return match on August 11. The first,
played in Melbourne earlier in the
season, was won 26-18 by the home side.
Last year, in the first R.U. inter-State
match between the two in Adelaide, the
Vies, only got home by 23-21. Those
who have seen the Victorians in action
against N.S.W. will appreciate the fact
that the South Australians, young as they
are at the game, are already well out of
the mug stage.
* * * *
“Tenakoe”: Good judges of Maori-
land Rugby—and that embraces 99.99
per cent, of the inhabitants of the
Shivery Isles —are horribly gloomy about
the prospects of the All-Blacks in Aus-
tralia this year. The game in M.L. has de-
veloped into a dull, slogging business, and,
according to the knowalls, this is due to
the return to the international rule as to
kicking into touch. There is no basis
for this theory, which is being worked
for all it is worth by veiled League pro-
pagandists. If any doubt, let them re-
member that, though the Wallabies had
to comply with this rule in South Africa,
they avoided kicking into touch on the
full wherever possible. They made their
games fast and interesting, and won two
of their five Tests with the ’Boks, a
record that only M.L. has been able to
equal for years.
* * * *
“Red and Green”: Footballers of all
codes in N.S.W. and Queensland will be
glad to hear that a benefit has been fixed
up for Ben Wearing, South Sydney’s fly-
ing wing-threequarter, who was one of
the big gate attractions for the League
club for 14 years to 1933. The match
will be against Newcastle and Northern
Districts at Sydney Cricket Ground on
August 6. Wearing represented the State
10 times against Queensland, three times
against English teams, and twice against
M. He repped for Australia against
the 1921-22 Kangaroos, and was reserve
winger against the visiting Englishmen
the next year.
* * * *
“Gate”: That proposal to establish
another Rugby League first-grade dis-
trict in Sydney (B. 20/6/’34) is far from
being received with whole-hearted en-
thusiasm. The chief objectors are the
established grade clubs, which see slices
of their territory being snipped off to
form the proposed Canterbury-Banks-
town club, Western Suburbs, which gains
many good recruits from the junior body,
being particularly vociferous. Indeed,
one W.S. delegate asked the N.S.W.R.L.
the other night if it not so long ago had
not been considering heaving the C.-B.
crowd out of the League altogether be-
cause of certain misfeasances.
The Nineteenth Hole
As was expected, the N.S.W. foursomes
title was retained by Jim Ferrier, of
Manly, and George Thompson, of Bonnie
Doon, who turned in a card of 152 (74-
78). The Queensland pair, Radcliffe and
Francis, and a couple of Schlapps from
Victoria were the only outlanders in the
tourney. All finished well down the
course. Ferrier, at time of writing this,
holds the Queensland amateur, open and
foursomes (with T. Healy) and the
N. close and foursomes champion-
ships— not bad going for a lad no't yet
of age.
“Susie Swattit”: N.S.W. associates’
country championship, played off at the
Lakes club course, ended in a win for
Molly McLeish, of Moss Vale, from
Doreen Ashton, of Wollongong, 4 up and
2 to play, after the winner was 1 up at
the end of the first 18 holes. In the
afternoon the McLeish’s deadly putting
gave her the lead, which was never
seriously threatened.
❖ * * *
“Stoke Pogis”: S. Brews, the South
African golfer who came from nowhere
in the British open to figure second, 5
strokes behind Cotton’s record score,
got some recompense for his long trip
by winning the French open title —a
tourney which ranks third to the British
and American events in importance.
Most of the British and Continental
front-rank players made up the field, but,
though Cotton and ths Americans
Sarazen and Kirkwood entered, they did
not start. Brews’s card for the four rounds
was 284, Boyer and Boomer, the latter
winner of the event several times, tying
for second place with 286. The Afri-
kander’s rounds were 71, 68, 74 and 71
—pretty hot for a European champion-
ship course.

“Carnoustie”: Captain George Morris
of Britain, who wagered he could do 10
consecutive rounds of the Walmer and
Kingsdown course in 24 hours under
900 strokes, duly collected his £3OO
wager. He started at 4 a.m. and finished
at 9 p.m., covering 40 miles and taking
889 strokes. The course is 5797 yards
and bogeyed at 72. Morris is a 10-
handicap man, and his worst round, 97,
was the last, in which he finished the 180
holes with badly blistered feel.

“Divot Digger”: It looks as if the pro-
posed visit of a team of leading American
professional golfers to Australia to take
part in the Melbourne centenary tourney
and other Australian events is like fairy
gold or Jack Lang’s political promises—up
to putty. Some time ago the Americans
offered to send over six of the best pro-
fessionals and play three international
matches in Sydney, Melbourne and Bris-
bane in addition to the big Melbourne
show if a £l5OO guarantee was forth-
coming. The centenary people declined
on the ground that they were offering
prize-money totalling £3OOO and that
should be enough. The Yanks replied
that £3OOO, even if they won it all, was
comparative chicken-feed to stars who
played from Canada to Mexico and back
the yeaj round and usually for big
money, and pointed out that the trip
would lose them four months, at least,
of this profitable trot round. The
N.S.W.P.G.A. has offered to give the
guarantee if the Victorian crowd will
allow the international match at Mel-
bourne to be played before the centenary
shivoo. The Victorians are turning a deaf
ear to date, and a washout is indicated.
Racquet and Bawl
Crawford lost his All-England cham-
pionship to Perry at Wimbledon at
the week-end, the Englishman winning
most convincingly in three sets, 6-3, 6-0,
7-5. Perry now holds the English, Ameri-
can and Australian titles, and will be
defending the two last this year. Hop-
man reached the semi-finals of the
doubles with Prenn, and with the elimina-
tion of this pair by the Americans Lott
and Stoeffen the last Australian faded
out of the picture, Joan Hartigan having
been beaten by Helen Jacobs. She had
reached the semi-finals —a fine achieve-
ment for a girl making her first appear-
ance at Wimbledon.
“Unlicked Cub”: The earlier rounds
of the Wimbledon tourney were marked
by the usual “temperamental” outbursts.
Perry cut such capers in his match with
Menzel that the Czech told him to “stop
fooling.” Austin, the pretty boy of Eng-
fish tennis, was so upset when he lost a
set to Shields that he kicked his racquet
into the crowd, where it hit a woman.
When finally beaten he hit an “out” ball
returned by Shields into the stands in a fit
of temper. Later he was good enough to
admit that on other fields of sport “a
similar exhibition might have provoked
disapproval.” Tennis will never be taken
seriously by followers of other sports
until this childish behavior is disciplined.
$ $ -l’
“Centre Court”: Perry and Hughes,
with South African Kirby, have defi-
nitely decided to come to Australia this
year. The trio go to the U.S.A. for the
national championships, and leave for
Australia after playing at Los Angeles
in September. That will land them here
in time for the N.S.W. championships
at the end of November if the A.L.T.A.
permits, and they should show in the
Victorian events in January before the
special centenary tourney.
* * * *
“Cut Shot”: N.S.W. is sending a
tennis team to Queensland early in
August, and, as is usual with the L.T.A.,
expects it to earn its oats. In addition to
appearing in Brisbane in the inter-State
“You don’t seem pleased
about the new baby

“Py korry, no. Nice
doctor you are! I
want wing three-quar-
ter.”
match and the Queensland champion-
ships, the circus will show at Grafton,
Bellingen and Murwillumbah on the way
up. After 10 days’ agreeable relaxation
in the events at Brisbane, the side will
play at Glen Innes, Armidale and Tam-
worth on the way back home. By the
time this trip ends, on August 20, the
players should carry very little super-
fluous fat.
“Rev. Knucklebone”: It looks as if
something definite has at last been done
about the English women’s tennis team
for Australia. It is cabled that Dorothy
Round (champion), Miss Lyle and Miss
Dearman have been chosen. They
will come here by America, but will not
play there, though they will hop off at
Maoriland on the way over for a bit of
practice. These are the official trio, but
others are willing to come along if the
people on this side guarantee exes.
The English team will play in other
States as well as Victoria. The selection
has yet to be endorsed by the Victorian
L.T.A.
“Top Spin”: It is announced that

versally used on the Continent on
account of the expense of maintaining
grass in good order, may shortly make
their appearance in Australia. A company
has acquired the Australian rights, and,
provided the necessary ingredients are
available in Australia —samples are now
on their way to Europe —the artificial
surfaces will soon be available. It is
claimed that the stuff is practically equal
to grass. Some Australian players,
notably McGrath, have condemned them
as so slow that it is useless to attempt to
get pace on one’s shot when playing on
them. One undoubted advantage is that
they are waterproof and can be used a
few minutes after rain has fallen, which
is more than can be said for grass or the
ant-bed and gravel courts on which the
great majority of Australians play.

“Konedobu”: 1 note that the Inter-
national Tennis Federation has admitted
Kenya Colony, Esthonia and Columbia
—not the “Hail” variety —to its list, each
with one vote on the council. Why has
Papua been overlooked? There are some
of us here in Port Moresby, with a few
of the bobs the Commonwealth gang has
left us, to say that our local club will
take on the lot of the three new members
of the I.T.F. and leave them wishing they
had never been dragged out of their
obscurity.
Miscellaneous
“Dedans”: Yet another agony is to be
added to the Melbourne centenary aber-
rations. This time it is “Royal” tennis,
a game that only an infinitesimal sec-
tion of civilised humanity has seen and
a still smaller proportion can pretend to
understand. Melbourne and Tasmania
have the only two courts south of the
Line, and the game is restricted in this
country to a few of the elect in those two
places. The annual championship for
the gold racket begins in Melbourne at
the end of October, Gerald Patterson
being the present holder. The inter-State
match between Melbourne and Tassie
and the professional championship will
be played a fortnight earlier.
“Acme”: The amateur ice-skating
championships of N.S.W. at Sydney
Glaciarium provided some good sport.
K. Kennedy retained his quarter title
with a record spin of 47 3-ssec. and
won the half-mile open handicap from
scratch in lmin. 38 l-ssec. A quaint
turn on the programme was the finish
of the handicap for girls under 14. One
lass led into the straight with another
close behind and coming fast. Catch-
ing the leader just short of the post the
second runner threw her arm round her
neck and both crossed the line together.
Result, the race and the prize to the
third finisher, the other two being
bracketed for second place.
A. L. Hayes, who died in Sydney at
86 the other day, could fairly claim to
be an all-round sportsman. Born in
Parramatta, he became the first secretary
of the first bowling club in N.S.W., estab-
lished at the old Woolpack Hotel, and
was a member of the first rink to play
on the green —that was 64 years ago.
He was also a cricketer of note, playing
for the district against two English
teams. He had few equals as an ama-
teur billiard player, and in three matches
against John Roberts—with a good
start, of course —won two.

“Old Q.”: Brisbane sport organisa-
tions seem to have a mania for falling
out with their State opposite numbers.
Brisbane Rugby League has been at
daggers drawn with the Q.R.L. for years,
and the feud still smoulders. The Bris-
bane Rowing Association is the latest to
hoist the flag of secesh. It has prepared
a new constitution, from which
several of the rules of the
Q.R.A. embodied in the old
one have been cut out. The
Q.R.L. has not been remarkable
for its tact of late years, and
other district rowing bodies have
been restless under its rule.
“Tenth Slip”: Perhaps the most futile
performance to the debit of the Board
of Control was its attempt to collect a
team to tour M.L. after the side for Eng-
land had been picked. When at last it
induced a lot of leftovers to make the
trip, Maoriland refused to have them.
In the meantime, the selected ones had
laid out varying amounts in clothing
and gear. After some pressure the board
said it would foot the bills. That was
four months ago, and at time of writing
not a single man has been repaid a stiver.
* * * *
“Moore Park”: With another English
visit due in a couple of years, the Sydney
C.G. trustees are to get on with the
building of new stands and the increase
of the accommodation generally with the
funds they have in hand. One new stand
will go up for a beginning, taking the
place of the trustees’ and northern stands,
continuing to the back of the northern
sightboard. This is to be set back 50ft.
from the fence, a grave error in writer’s
opinion. A fearful amount of seating
accommodation is already wasted in the
“lawns” in front of several of the stands.
The seating should be carried down from
the stands right to the fence. Then the in-
fliction of having to stand up all day
frantically endeavoring to get a glimpse
of the play through the crowd in front
would be abolished, and people who
dodge matches drawing full houses would
cease to stay away. Further, the slope of
the “Hill” should be terraced with seats.
In summer it is not too uncomfortable to
squat on the grass. In winter it is out
of the question, and it must be remem-
bered that football is one of the ground’s
biggest money- spinners.


BUSINESS,ROBBERY,ETC.
Gold and Pitt-street
Ralph King, a Sydney sharebroker, in
his last circular voiced the opinion that
the gold boom has not yet come,
“although a wave or boomlet has been
experienced.” Mr. King’s office has
given the investing public some very
good advice on gold shares from time
to time, and the opinion deserves respect.
But it also requires—and gets—qualifi-
cation.
Mr. King warns us that buying into “con-
cerns where unknown factors predomi-
nate. .. .is not the way to make money.
It is thrilling entertainment, and savings
from income can be used for such a pur-
pose, while capital should be reserved
for proved producers which are dividend-
paying.”
If you understand the factors regulat-
ing the price of gold, and know some-
thing about gold-mining, that is sound
counsel. If you don’t know these things,
or are liable to forget that eventually a
goldmine becomes a worthless hole in
the ground, it is good advice to keep
your capital out of gold altogether, specu-
late how you will with your pocket-
money. A sharebroker can’t always be
communicating with clients as to pros-
pects of their stocks, however willing he
may be to give advice when it is asked
for. Many people begin to worry about
their shares only when the market has
collapsed.
As to the gold boom having not yet
arrived, that is certainly true if a “gold-
production boom” is meant. But we
have had a gold-share boom. Though
there are dozens of exploration and de-
velopmental shows in Australia that will
never repay their capital out of gold won,
there are some which are at present only
scratching on big or fair-sized ore-bodies.
When such mines are fully developed,
and the volume and values of the lodes
are measured up, the main gamble after-
wards will be the price of gold.
The present high price of the metal
is merely a way of expressing the depre-
ciation in commodity and paper-cur-
rency values. Britain’s pound is no
longer tied to gold, and its external worth
is that which foreign countries are pre-
pared to pay for it in their own currency
or gold. This price is largely governed
by price levels and balance of indebted-
ness. Our price of gold is based on the
English price in sterling pounds, plus the
London /Australia exchange; and our
exchange is ultimately regulated by funds
in London.
In the past “gold famines” (as they
look to be) have worked their own cure
by the rising price of the metal in terms
of commodities and currencies. There
is at present no general famine in gold,
but some countries (such as Germany)
are very short of it, and those countries
(such as Britain) which nominally value
their currency at pre-war levels couldn’t
retain their gold if they returned to their
old gold standard.
While price levels keep low gold will
be dear—and profitable to mine. Even
if Britain devalues her pound and re-
issues gold coin of lower value (in terms
of gold) it must take some time before
costs of mining creep up to check gold
production. But as trade recovers and
prices rise, and the premium on gold en-
courages fresh output, the tendency
should be for gold to fall. There is no-
thing yet to show that such a tendency
is definitely under way. The Pitt-street
mining ’quake was merely a falling-off
in the betting.
“Down 15 to 20 p.c.”
The opening London wool sales for
July showed a decline in prices. Alto-
gether 11,437 bales were offered, of which
3530 were sold on the first day at rates
15 to 20 p.c. lower than the closing
prices for the May sales. Buyers were
hesitant, and Germany was not repre-
sented. Italy is also restricting imports.
Prices, however, are still a bit better
than they were this time last year. The
statistical position is sound, and, though
Germany has renewed her embargo (the
settlement of the exchange rumpus may
conceivably make a difference), the
breathing-space allowed since the last
sales has enabled the market to readjust
its outlook. If other Continental coun-
tries remain open to our wool, the feel-
ing of nervousness on speculators’
account may ease somewhat. The expert
speculator’s attitude is a big factor in
wool prices, though consumption and pro-
duction eventually govern the position.
Winchcombe Carson, in their latest cir-
cular, say that the present wool situation
shows that a healthy statistical position
is not the only factor in encouraging a
good market. Even in view of the in-
creased clip that will be shorn this year,
the firm thinks that the position as re-
gards stocks abroad is satisfactory. Tex-
tile manufacture in England has received
little check, though the mills have been
mainly working up their existing stocks
of raw materia], and doing little buying
on the market.
France, on the other hand —like most
Continental countries —has received some-
thing of a knock as far as textile exports
are concerned. Depreciated currencies
in other countries have been the main
trouble. France’s loss has been largely
England’s gain ; the great activity shown
at Bradford during the early part of 1934
is, therefore, not a true guide to world
activity. Our woolgrower has lost part
of one market, to make up for it in
another.
Wool and Employment
The financial year just closed should
show the full effect of trade recovery
brought about by improved wool prices.
Balance sheets of most public companies
“Every second cheque I’ve drawn this month has been for clothes for von"
“You wretch! Who’s had all the others?"
will shortly be coming out; and ex-
actly what to keep up the sleeve in view
of the present uncertainty will be the
problem of directors and managers. The
wiser ones will hold something back out
of last year’s earnings in case the cur-
rent term turns out no better than present
wool prices indicate.
It will be hard if the existing buoyancy
in manufacturing activity is checked
during the new term. Apart from the
improved tone in the actual wool in-
dustry itself, our progress in making
for ourselves has been one of the
brightest features of the last two depres-
sion years. Factory figures quoted by
the N. S. Wales Minister for Labor the
other day showed that, in his State,
there were 41,089 persons under 21
employed at the end of 1933, as
against 33,442 in 1931 ; over the same
period the number of adults engaged rose
from 106,253 to 129,907. During the
last six months there has been further
improvement.
The good work has been accompanied
by no great rise in prices, except in the
case of a few regulated commodities,
especially milk. Clothing, particularly
locally-made woollens and felt hats, is
notably cheap.
Lower wages are not as low as they
seem ; and more people are getting them.
The number of unemployed in N. S.
Wales, including those on the dole, is
claimed by the Government to be down
to 24,000. But there were 80.000 on “re-
lief works.”
The B.H.P. steelworks showed a
seasonal slackening-off in activity after
1933 closed, but the output of pig-iron
is again over the 31,000-ton-a-month
mark, and the production of ingot steel
(38,000 tons) for the month to June 10
was exceptionally high. In the building
trade —a great source of employment in
good times—there has been a marked
recovery throughout Australia, including
the Ma State, which felt the blow worst
of all.
“D.E.”: I recently paid a deposit on a
five-roomed cottage in a Sydney suburb ;
and now I know why house property is
so dear. I have learned one of the rea-
sons, anyway. Solicitors’ costs, stamp
duties, valuation fees and the like came
to £42 2s. 3d. It is a Torrens title, and
the mortgage forms are printed. I have
nothing to say against the solicitors, a
highly-reputable firm. Under the Con-
veyancing Act they could have charged
me £7 7s. more. Had that amount been
added to the bill, plus the procuration
fee requested by the agent, the price of
my five-roomed cottage would have been
increased by £67 15s. 3d. As it is, I am
dashed sorry I didn’t go on paying rent.
* * #
The Australian trade balance for the
11 months to the end of May was
£39,500,000 sterling. The commodity
surplus—excess of wool, wheat and other
products exported over goods and
materials imported—was £33,000,000.
Bullion and specie accounted for most
of the rest. There is another month’s
figures to be taken into account, but
the full year’s figures (to June 30) should
show little change compared with the
May balance. The closing of the wool
sales has affected our exports lately.

Vic. cos. are finding it difficult to
obtain the services of properly qualified
mine-managers. Vic. Chamber of Mines
reckons that the revival in the industry
is being seriously hampered by this lack,
and is asking the Minister for a tem-
porary amendment of the Mines Act.
Owing to the long depression in gold-
mining there had been little encourage-
ment for men to qualify as managers?
* * * *
“Stung'’: I am told you can still get
milk for 6d. a quart in Melbourne, not-
withstanding the successive increases
granted by the Milk Board to cockies. In
Sydney it is 7d. a quart for country milk
and Bd. for suburban. Yet, according to
the union secretary, carters’ wages have
been reduced 16s. a week since the 7d.-Bd.
charges were fixed. If this doesn’t
amount to daylight robbery, tell me
something that does.
* * * *
“Jumbuck”: Most of the sheepskins
sold at the central markets are sent away
from this country, and, with the excep-
tion of a few local fellmongers, thou-
sands of pounds’ worth of work goes
abroad. When wool values slump, hun-
dreds of bales of the staple are with-
drawn at the sales. It’s only at very odd
times that sheepskins fail to find buyers.
Why can’t Australia use its sheepskins to
greater advantage? Slipe and basils
would sell abroad, and the country of
production would reap a greater benefit
if the skins were treated locally.
*** ■ *
“C.L.”: The tremendous increase in
the world’s visible supplies of raw
materials is shown by statistics. In Dec.,
1933, in percentages of mid-1926 quan-
tities, zinc stocks had accumulated
to 967 p.c., wheat 422, rubber 338, sugar
238, cotton 233, butter 205, cocoa 202,
tin 182 and coal 174; petrol showed a
decrease. Comparing 1934 and 1927
gold prices of commodities, cocoa is now
only 18 p.c. of its former value,
rubber 21, butter 24, raw sugar IT,
copper 37, lead 37, wheat 39, cotton
40, zinc 40, and tin 50.
* * * *
“Der Jong”: S’Africa, satisfied that
it has established the merino sheep, with
the assistance of Australian breeders, is
now talking of placing an embargo on
the export of the woollies. It was S’Afriea
that invented the embargo on export of
livestock. When the ostrich-feather
trade was a flourishing one several of the
Australian States tried to come into the
game, but Cape Colony forbade exports
of birds and eggs. About the only other
places attempting ostrich-breeding in
those days were California and Lower
Egypt, and the quality of their stock was
poor ; so the ostrich gradually faded out
as a moneymaker in this country.

L. Lowsby, a member of the new
Commonwealth Dairy Produce Equali-
sation Co., told butter-producers at Mt.
Barker (S.A.) the other day that for every
71b. of factory butter sold in Australia
101 b. had to be exported. Hence, though
the local wholesale market was some-
where around Is. 3d. a lb., the average
to the producer for a full 12 months’
working of the scheme should be in the
vicinity of lOd.

Melbourne building activity has re-
sulted in a shortage of trained artisans ;
the difficulty has arisen partly through
the depression having practically stopped
the training of apprentices. In Adelaide
there is still a large number of unem-
ployed craftsmen available; figures up
to about a week ago showed that there
were 1480 building-trade unionists out
of jobs, mainly carpenters, painters and
bricklayers.

“Kariah”: It’s extremely doubtful
whether the oyster leases recently made
available at Mallacoota (Vic.) will supply
all the requirements of the Melbourne
market—the hope of Vic. Game and
Fisheries Department. These days oyster
culture is a tough job. Apart from
ordinary difficulties, the bivalve is a poor
spawner in the colder latitudes; he
refuses to do his duty in this respect
south of the 30th parallel.

Duponts and Daytons have turned out
a motor tyre of synthetic rubber. The
“rubber” is made from acetylene, salt and
water, and at present costs a dollar a pound
to produce, as against 15 cents for the
real stuff; but the process is looked
upon as a potential check against high
rubber prices. Acetylene (carbide), the
chief constituent, is made by mixing, at
high temperature, coal and limestone.

“Larrapinta”: Johann Ludwig Streng,
dead in Adelaide, was a marvel in his
line. He was a master-cutler when he
arrived in the Hesperides in 1876. Begin-
ning in an Adelaide side street, he soon
started to receive orders from surgeons
and hospitals all over Australia. The
forge over which he presided personally
to the last turned out edged tools ranging
from the tiniest scalpel to butchers’ knives
and hatchets. Given fair treatment, his
products were imperishable. I have a
pocket-knife made by him 35 years ago,
and it’s as good as new when it comes
to cutting. Like Peter Doody, he had a
motto: “Sheffield steel, id iss der best.”
He used no other.
* * * *
“Travel Stain”: A new dispute has
arisen in the sugar industry. At Bin-
gera and Fairymead, in the Bundaberg
(Q.) district, flocks of sheep have been
running on the tramlines and the bar-
rack yards cropping grass, the mobs
being under the care of shepherds. The
dispute is whether the shepherds shall be
paid as shepherds or under the sugar-
workers’ award.

Dr. Edgar Bainton, Sydney Con.’s new
director, made his Australian ddbut as
conductor last week, when he put the
Con. orchestra over a series of formid-
able hurdles—Prelude to “Tristan and
Isolde,” Dvorak’s “Carnival” overture,
Debussy’s “Fetes” and “L’Apres-Midi
d’un Faune” and Beethoven’s Ninth. All
numbers were very interestingly inter-
preted, the thin mists of Debussy being
prettily interwoven, the Wagnerian
lament impressively presented and the
giant structure of the Beethoven work
(done with choir and soloists) sym-
pathetically indicated. The Bainton wine
is too new in the orchestra’s bottle for
final criticism of the conductor’s methods
but the first sip gives promise of strength
and a delicate bouquet in maturity.

Muriel Edsall for her pianoforte re-
cital at Sydney Con. Hall on Thursday
night presented a well-varied programme
—Beethoven’s E Major Sonata, Op. 109,
some Chopin, Schumann and Debussy,
the Franck Prelude, Fugue and Varia-
tions, Godowsky’s v arrangement of the
Albeniz “Tango” and Dohnanyi’s tran-
scription of the “Naila” waltz by
Delibes. The pianist came through these
exacting tests of technique with flying
colors. She has a neat, sure touch ; her
phrasing is flawless, and her mastery of
digital difficulties is complete enough to
allow her to concentrate on expression.
Fact: The lady of “Madame Pom-
padour” (produced by the Firm at Melb.
King’s) was by birth Miss Fish, daughter
of an army contractor. She married
respectably, but her mother had put into
her head the idea of being the mistress
of Louis XV., just as American mothers
to-day put into their daughters’ heads
to become movie stars and being the
umpteenth wife of Douglas Fairbanks.
Miss Fish ogled her way into the king’s
favor, divided a fortune with her brother,
and for 20 years ruled France, which was
more shocked at her lowly birth than at
her adultery. She was a better man than
Louis. She imbibed the teachings of the
new philosophers, dowered poor girls,
assisted old men and repaired ruined
villages. For her doddering old para-
mour she was a useful piece of furniture
about the palace. She provided him with
plenty of amusement, and he might have
dropped a tear at her funeral; but he
didn’t*.
Fancy : King Louis (Richard Parry) is
a beautiful young fellow. Rene (John
Dudley) is an admirably voiced lover
who is appointed to her bodyguard and
sentries her bedroom, but quite chastely,
and is eventually united to his lawful
wife, Jean Duncan, who turns out to be
the Pompadour’s long-lost sister. Pom-
padour (Sylvia Welling) is beautiful,
charming, as brain-empty as a rabbit
and given to dancing in the latest fashion
with stray poets and apostrophising the
moon songfully at appropriate moments.
Frederick Lonsdale’s play is magni-
ficently dressed, framed with gemlike
ladies and gorgeously upholstered—
some of the sets are as tasty as George
Upward has designed, Mrs. Jerrams has
wardrobed and J.C.W. has presented to a
grateful nation —but at bottom it remains
a Mo farce, worth intrinsically ten
minutes and prolonged from eight to
eleven. The Mo farce character is en-
gagingly brought out in the third act
where poet Calicot (the excellent Cecil
Kellaway) conceals himself in a box and
is discovered to the king in the Pompa-
dour’s sleeping apartment. Miss Well-
ing compares well with Beppy de Vries,
the Dutch danseuse who functioned in
the original production in 1927, though
her manner is entirely different. Leo
Fall’s music is colorful.

Melbourne University leaped into
the front rank as a purveyor of intellec-
tual theatrical pabulum by its presenta-
tion of Elmer Rice’s “The Adding
Machine” at the Princess. There are
about 3000 students of both sexes at the
Uni. and a raft of professors and lec-
turers, and their relatives and friends
probably number another 20,000. On
the first night of this cultural experi-
ment there were about 500 people
present.
Despite inevitable breakdowns, Mostyn
Wright’s devoted band made an extra-
ordinarily good fist of it. Mr. Zero,
for 25 years a human adding machine
whose yearning for companionship and
fulfilment has found expression in a
squalid marriage and improper feelings
towards the Girl to whom he dictates
figures in the office, is sacked by his em-
ployer in favor of a more efficient scien-
tific gadget. He murders his boss and is
hanged, and the Girl, obsessed by her
undeclared and unlawful love for him,
commits suicide. Zero rises from the
dead in a graveyard and meets the soul
of another frustrated individual. He has
murdered his mother, who brought him
up to be chaste, pure and pious. The
two proceed to the Elysian Fields, where
the matricide is dismayed to learn that
hellfire is a myth, and he is not to be
allowed to expiate his sin by everlasting
torment. They meet the Girl, who is
prepared to accept the prospect of an
eternity of felicity which the matricide
and bossicide are unable to enter, the
one because of his sense of sin and the
other because of his spiritual emptiness.
They are translated to the heavenly
reconditioning centre, where their souls
are prepared for another return to earth,
as one of an infinite series of reincar-
nations.
To deepen the perspective, talking-
picture apparatus hurled trams, trains
and various phenomena of nature, plus
incidental noises, into the proceedings,
but the effect was better in intention than
performance. The acting, however, was
outstanding. Stanley Lowe, as Zero, was
amazingly good, and his soliloquy in the
dock was a finely-sustained effort. Gay
Watson made an admirable character-
study of Mrs. Zero. As the murderer of
his mother, Tom Eckersley was suffi-
ciently sombre. Catherine Duncan was
a sympathetic Girl. Most of the others
were ciphers, but ciphers by intention.

“The Merry Malones,” at Melb.
Apollo, Ernest C. Rolls’s latest plot
against Melbourne’s domesticated even-
ings, is by George M. Cohan, and differs
from its innumerable predecessors of the
musicomedy genus mainly in the author’s
extensive borrowing of the Pirandello
device of making his characters step out-
side the play and talk about the plot and
their position in it. Being new, the device
tickles. Robert Capron, a tall, thin, in-
dustrious American comedian, is the chief
protagonist as a Noo Yark millionaire
whose son, John Moore, becomes en-
amored of Polly Walker, the lowly Irish
heroine, who lives in a Bronx exclusively
inhabited by Irish and Hebrew comic
characters. Mr. Rolls’s idea of Bronx
squalor is purely relative, and his street
in the locality could be shifted to Toorak
without anybody noticing the difference.
Miss Walker is a charming girl, well-
nourished, a good dancer and a deplor-
able singer. Her wholesome naturalness
should endear her to a warm-hearted
public. As her father, Florenz Ames, a
sedate little man, exploits a well-known
brand of Hibernian sentiment without
overemphasising it. Of the rest of the
cast only the dancers matter. The Dance
Cyclonic of Cis and Buddy Roberts is
the latest last word in corybantic
manoeuvres, and it is difficult to see any
further developments for the medium
unless somebody succeeds in severing
connection with the laws of gravitation
altogether. The plot is the familiar tale
of the girl who wouldn’t marry for money
under any circumstances, and marries
into it at the final curtain. A notable
scene is the millionaire’s office, which is
a successful attempt to write musicomedy
in the style of grand opera. Mr. Rolls,
as usual, overflows generously in the
sartorial and scenic departments, but
somehow or other does not always
convey the desired effect of grandeur.

At Melbourne Queen’s Hall Beresford
Fowler produced the outstanding achieve-
ment of his long battle in the cause of
intellectual drama. Shaw’s “The Shewing
Up of Blanco Posnet” is not easy matter
for any crew of actors, but H. N.
Gregory, Mollie Locke, Douglas Kelly
and Leo Burke gave more of Shaw’s
intent in this curious melodrama of the
emotions than many distinguished pro-
fessionals present critic has had experi-
ence of. The indomitable Fowler’s next
marks are “Sirocco” and “This Was a
Man,” two Noel Coward plays not yet
produced in Australia. The last-named
was banned by the Lord Chamberlain
and forbidden production in England.

“By Candlelight,” a light, flirtatious
Continental comedy in three acts by Sieg-
fred Geyer, was the Cairns Memorial
Players’ subject-matter at Melb. Garrick.
The subtle amorosity of some of the
situations required delicate handling, and
they got it from Frederick Trotter as
the Baron Egon von Felsen, Eric Morris
as a bewildered valet, Beryl Walker as
Elizabeth, the unsophisticated lady’s
maid with momentary upstairs aspira-
tions, Gordon Praetz as an irate hus-
band and Compton Coutts, who pro-
duced the trifle with intelligence. Barrie’s
curtain-raiser, “Shall We Join the
Ladies?” had the services of the last-
named actor, one of the best comedians
overlooked by professional entrepreneurs.
The reappearance of Fritz Hart at the
head of the Melbourne . Symphony
Orchestra was the occasion for an even-
ing at the Town Tall which was almost
entirely jolly. Proceedings started with
the exhilarating “Figaro” overture of
Mozart. The next item was Beethoven's
Seventh, which Wagner described as the
apotheosis of the dance. It is a dance
of bacchanalians, and the pace of the
first movement is so exhausting that in
the second movement the dancers have to
sit out, so to speak. This section was
more competently played than the
scherzo and the tremendous finale, but
there was little to complain of in the per-
formance as a whole. Mozart’s Concerto
No. 3 in G brought into the fray Elise
Steele’s violin, of lightness and grace all
compact. Sibelius’s Romance in C for
strings got an encore which was de-
served. The evening closed with three
pieces by Elgar, including the “Wand of
Youth,” Suite No. 2, which the English
composer produced for the edification
of his family when he was 12 and re-
v/rote and elaborated 26 years later. It
is a brisk, neat affair of six related sec-
tions, and easier to listen to than many
of its composer’s longer works.

Adelaide Repertory Theatre’s latest
three-nights venture, “Sometimes Even
Now,” is a successful London play
by a little-known author, Chetham-
Strode. The heroine is one of those
war-time girls who might set no limits on
their hospitality to an officer on leave.
That feverish atmosphere is well indi-
cated ; so is the calm of to-day, when
she meets some of the old lot (now
happily married) and they all discuss how
insufferable is modern youth. Beryl
Cook acted finely all through, and
Mimie Mattin was agonisingly brave
in a brief intense scene as a mother with
bad news. The diverse officers were well
realised by Robert Matthews and Cedric
Hele; and, in a play of too much talk
and too little action, Ronald Simpson
brisked things up, whenever on the stage,
in one of those man-of-the-world parts
which he does so well that he is now
sentenced to them, probably, for life.
Cyril Riley produced. Cyril Stacey did
the effective stage interiors, the 1915
scenes being dressed to period by his
wife.

The S.A. Orchestra plans to tackle a
violin concerto, very old and yet a
novelty. It was written by a precocious
German boy of 10, was named after and
presented to a Princess Adelaide of
France, and by her given away—and for-
gotten. However, the boy became
famous as Mozart, and the work, lately
discovered (with authentic pedigree), is
now being played by Menuhin the boy
fiddler. Prof. Davies, of Adelaide, struck
by its appropriate name, is importing it,
and will give the first Australian produc-
tion, with Peter Bornstein as soloist.
The Palette,
Ronald Wakelin, whose recent paint-
ings are on show at the Macquarie
Galleries, Sydney, is, according to one of
his admirers, an experimentalist in the
“representation of plastic form” (what-
ever that may mean), and has been in-
fluenced by Cezanne. Furthermore, he
“organises pictorial masses into signifi-
cant entities” and practises an “emotional
realism which strives to realise inherent
values rather than the momentary look
of things.” Translated into straiter
terms this seems to mean that when Mr.
Wakelin’s drawing seems to be delib-
erately bad, as in the case of the distorted
crock in “Still Life in Blue,” the mis-
shapen jug in “Dahlias” and the lop-
sided green vase in “Still Life with Red
Apples,” that’s a sign that the beholder
knows naught of the plastic form and the
inherent values. The same applies if the
towers of St. Matthew’s at Windsor
and of a church in Parramatta seem to
be leaning almost as much as the one in
Pisa, and if Mr. Wakelin’s apples exhibit
rectangular tendencies. To see those
pictures like that indicates that the be-
holder is not spiritually en rapport with
the inner life of jugs, apples and churches.
Present critic is free to admit that Mr.
Wakelin has a pretty taste in color, and
by some sort of magic suggests three
dimensions with a few blobs of paint,
but he can’t believe that the examples of
pottery, ecclesiastical architecture and
pomology pictured by the painter radiate
as much sin as they are credited with.
Judging by her exhibit of oils at the
Hogan Galleries, Melbourne, Miss
Grace Gardiner might have been brought
up on a desert island. They have the
merit of being entirely innocent of aca-
demic convention. For this reason, if
for no other, they woo the eye more
pleasingly than many more pretentious
works by more technically-proficient
painters. Miss Gardiner endeavors in
her unsophisticated way to record her
sensations of natural color, and in
“Autumn by the River” she nearly gets
it. She fails generally, however, from
inability to define one sensation in rela-
tion to another. She is like a singer who
loves making beautiful sounds and
warbles for the sake of warbling.
When a couple of painters happen to
be man and wife and paint in the same
studio, under the same conditions of light
and much the same subject, and when,
moreover, they are realists and at
approximately the same stage of develop-
ment, a joint show of their works is
apt to invite a charge of apparent
monotony. If, however, the pictures are,
as far as they go, faithful transcripts of
nature, the charge primarily should lie
against the latter. Which is absurd, as
Euclid would say, for nature is not
monotonous. The show in question is
the very distinguished one of Amalie and
A. D. Colquhoun at the Athenaeum,
Melbourne, and comprises nudes, still-
life and portraits. If each picture be con-
sidered as a partial solution of a parti-
cular problem, there is no lack,of variety.
Mr. Colquhoun’s still-lifes appear to be
looser, more definitely single impressions,
than his nudes and portraits, but the
“Portrait of My Mother,” which acting-
director Mclnnes has very sensibly ear-
marked for the Felton Bequest, is a
study of outstanding merit which will
have no difficulty in asserting its
superiority over about three-quarters of
the portraits, home-grown and imported,
in the National collection.
A gentle and almost cautious approach
to nature is that of John Farmer, the
Melbourne artist, 26 of whose canvases
have been addressed from Paris to the
Meldrum Gallery. Farmer’s landscapes
have a pleasant, caressing quality, and
are obviously painted by a man who
loves his job above all others. A little
impression of the harbor at Colombo is
among the freshest.
Kathleen Sauerbier’s show at Adelaide
Society of Arts Gallery is unusual. She
has been to Europe, and there imbibed
something of the modern idea which re-
quires the artist to see nature as the child
or the savage might see it. Thus the on-
looker can, according to temperament,
reverence the result as inspirational and
daring, or dismiss it as just bad work.
However, it is only a tendency; Miss
Sauerbier is not an extremist, and she
has on view heads and landscapes in
style more conventional than the ultra-
modern.


NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
Plain Living—and Speaking
“Humpy B.”: Queensland Mother-
craft Association has offended organised
Labor by the publication of a booklet,
“Square Meals for the Family,” in
which it is contended that man, wife
and child or two children can get 21
square meals for 19s. A list of square
meals is given. This is the recommenda-
tion for Monday:
Breakfast: Oatmeal porridge, milk,
sugar, bread or toast, dripping, jam or
syrup. Tea for adults; milk for children.
Lunch: Wholemeal bread, butter, sand-
wiches (brawn, grated cheese and tomato)
and fruit —a banana for each adult, and
half for a child.
Dinner: Liver and heart, pumpkin, pota-
toes, bread, lemon or pineapple sago
custard (with one egg).
The brawn is a remainder from the
Sunday dinner, having been prepared
for that meal f'rom “shin of beef” and
eaten with “lettuce, bread or scones, oat-
cake and jam or cake.” The Sunday
lunch consists of “roast mince loaf or
shepherd’s pie, with onion flavoring,
baked potatoes and vegetables.”
It is suggested that there should be a
meat meal every day, sometimes two ;
but there is a noticeable dearth of joints,
steak and chops. It is this which has
aroused the scorn of the stalwarts at
the Trades Hall. “Ridiculous,” shouts
Tim Moroney, the railwaymen’s secre-
tary.
Dr. Phyllis Cilento was chiefly re-
sponsible for the menus,
and she defends them
spiritedly. Regarding the
preference for cheap cuts,
she avers that “the cheap-
est cuts are just as
nutritious as the most ex-
pensive meat” ; and this is
true. It is also true that
Australians have a con-
tempt for meat dishes
which are prized by
peoples who have to make
their money go farther—
breast of mutton, for in-
stance. The inclusion of
liver on the list also pro-
voked Mr. Moroney and
his friends. “Why,” said
Dr. Cilento, “you know
nothing of the nutritive
values of meat. Pound for
pound, a threepenny liver
contains much more food value than the
best undercut fillet. It contains more
vitamins and iron.”
Substitution of dripping for butter
(only here and there, it is true) looks odd
in a country which is producing more
butter than it can sell; wonderfully good 7
butter, too. Dr. Cilento insists that “good
beef dripping is practically as nourish-
ing as butter,” and is preferred by many
people who can afford to pick and choose.
Milk, fruit, vegetables and jam are fairly
plentiful in the ration ; of course, bread
is not stinted.
Dr. Cilento does not argue that her
square meals are ideal, but she declares
that they are more varied and have
greater food value than the regimens of
many families where the breadwinner is
on relief or half-time work. Evidence
of this has been afforded at mothercraft
clinics at which mothers were asked to
state what they fed the family on. Many
cheerfully admitted that no small propor-
tion of the old man’s money went in
sweet biscuits and lollies.
It is good to see Queensland women
devoting so much attention to a subject
so important, and maintaining their
ground gallantly in spite of Trades Hall
fulminations. To despise wholesome food
because it is cheap, and waste it because
made-up dishes are “undemocratic” or
something, is folly of a kind which a
nation going through hard times should
abandon.
“Bowen Terrace”: Though scarcely
one in a hundred Brisbane people wants
a third bridge over the river within a dis-
tance of under two miles, the Government
is going on with the job, estimated to cost
£1,750,000. The fact that it will employ
400 men for three years is the only thing
to be said in its favor. Tenders for
construction will be called in Britain
and Australia, but, except for specialists,
no person not on the Queensland elec-
toral roll is to be employed. As a sop
to the flood-prevention campaigners,
£185,000 is to be spent in cutting a few
more yards off Kangaroo Point, which
forms a sharp hairpin bend in the river
just below the bridge site. A mere make-
shift: effectual prevention can only be
secured by building a big dam system
at the head of the Brisbane, where in a
wet season a hundred considerable creeks
pour their waters down the steep sides
of a mountain basin into the river.
“Foghorn”: The low clearance of the
Labor Government’s bridge—loo feet—
will cut out inter-State and overseas
steamers now using the wharves above
the site. For many years South Brisbane
wharves, a mile or more up the river,
have been the rendezvous for large over-
seas cargo vessels which have brought
profitable trade to South Brisbane, the
main street of which skirts the wharves,
and a considerable income to the City
Council. The Government’s attitude is
that it will be a good thing if the bridge
does drive shipping down-river to fresh
wharf sites. That the shift will cost ship-
ping interests many thousands is appar-
ently of no consequence.

“Hinds”: The Queensland meat indus-
try is mightily bucked at the news that
the Autolycus shipment of “chilled”
arrived in perfect condition. This parti-
cular shipment was made in circum-
CANNIBAL KING: “Well, you’re really only an entree, but as you’re the leader
of the expedition I’ll make you the piece de resistance."
stances which did not apply to earlier
consignments. A deep lower hold was
used; in this 1905 beef quarters were
hung in three tiers, the top hooked td the
rails and the second and third hung by
chains. Special precautions had to be
taken to prevent chafing and to ensure a
constant air circulation to maintain uni-
form temperatures through the 47 days’
voyage. This is the second large experi-
mental shipment by the Q.M.E. Board
and by far the biggest ever made from
Australia. Arranged shipments to the
end of the year show that 11 vessels will
take 20,000 quarters, totalling 1400 tons.
“Moorabie Tom”: Poor old Binghi
has been in everyone’s bad books of
late, but he showed his better self when
Gus Larsen, a prospector, was helplessly
ill in the wild country north-west of
Cooktown (N.Q.). A party of abos.
carried him, under vile wet-season
conditions, through jungles and over
crocodile-infested creeks to Port Stewart.
There they put him on board a lugger,
which took him to Cooktown. When the
lugger dropped in, the crew found that
the abos. had been sitting on the beach
in the wet all night without shelter or
fire. The only covering the party had
was a piece of canvas, and that was
covering the sick white man. Larsen
died in Cooktown hospital in spite of the
courageous attempt to save him.
“Mangold Wurzel”: An indignant cor-
respondent has written to the Brisbane
papers demanding that when the Agri-
cultural Show comes along in August
steps shall be taken to check the bona
fides of people who specialise in “one-
man-farm exhibits.” The writer roundly
asserts that some of these are the biggest
jokes in the show, and are about as
authentic as an urger’s tip for “the larst.”
There may be something in the claim.
I periodically spent some of my time in
a district of rural England. It being the
summer holidays, there was always a
flower show. The quality of the stuff
shown was staggering to an inquisitive
kid who had been wandering about the
parish for days giving attention to the
village gardens —the Rectory and th]e
“Big House” didn't compete, of course.
It was in disillusioned later years that I
found that the honor of winning the
first prize was taken in turn, Covent
Garden being called on to furnish the
winning exhibit.

“Eikh”: Of what use are Trade Com-
missioners, advertisements and what-
nots? For years we have been export-
ing cabinet woods all over the world..
In nearly every case they lose their
Australian nationality directly they hit
the importing country. A case in point
is the Queensland walnut. The most
luxurious train in the world, the tourist
express running between Calais and Paris,
is panelled throughout with this beauti-
ful wood—the best the French could get.
But it was imported from America,
where we sent it in rough logs. There
is only one reason why it was bought
from the Yanks—we were asleep.
* * =l= *
“Trochus Fly”: The statement of
Queensland’s Home Secretary that he
didn’t understand why there was so much
fuss about Jap sampans hits strangely on
the ear. His own department restricted
divers from taking the same type of
shell which the sampans have been
collecting. In one instance, one of
these craft appeared off Waraber Island
(a native reserve in Torres Strait),
dropped half a dozen small boats and
fished the reefs right alongside the
beach. But native swimmers collecting
the shell (which was “chicken,” under the
specified size) were liable to prosecution
and a fine of £5. Several fines have been
collected already. A few years ago the
Queensland Abo. Department sponsored
a bill making fishing in waters right
down the coast subject to stringent con-
ditions which cut out Europeans, half-
castes, South Sea men and other non-
“abos.” So much opposition was raised
that the thing did not operate. Mr.
Hanlon evidently finds that he cannot so
readily collect fines from the Japs as
from Australians.
* * ❖ ❖
“Mudurup”: An echo of John For-
rest’s exploring days comes from Perth
in the form of a letter to the “West
Australian” from one John Watson, who
first carried the glad tidings to Govern-
ment House that John and his party had
arrived safely at Eucla, a sort of halfway-
house on the journey from Perth to
Adelaide, in 1870. The little band, John,
his brother Alec, two other white men
and two natives, left Perth with 15 horses
in March and reached Adelaide in
August. Arrangements had been made
for a schooner to meet and reprovi-
sion the party at Eucla, and, according
to Watson, she was already at anchor
there, and had the stores and fodder
landed, when the explorers arrived, and
the two parties spent a jolly evening to-
gether. The schooner made a quick run
back to Fremantle, and the skipper, who
was Watson’s brother-in-law, rode in
haste to Perth and requisitioned Watson
to notify headquarters that the explorers
were half-way to their destination and
going strong. Government House, appar-
ently had to be awakened at 1 a.m. to
receive the good news. There are some
slight discrepancies between Watson’s
story and the account of the expedition
given in Battye’s “History.” The latter
says that the schooner first revictualled
the explorers at Esperance, and leaves it
a little doubtful whether there wasn’t a
second rendezvous at Israelite Bay as
well. But Watson, who speaks at first-
hand, as it were, ought to know best.
The future Lord Forrest, by the way,
was only 22 when he started on that trip
—he had his next birthday on the way.
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
A pair of newly-weds staying at a seaside
hotel were invited to attend a fancy-dress ball.
The wife, a clever girl, made a Bedouin cos-
tume for her lord with two sheets and a towel.
She was not pleased, at a later stage of the
evening, to hear her partner described by a
young man who had taken one over the eight
as a “Bedroom Arab.” v
Eira Boyd, a leading light of the Queens-
land Association in N. S. Wales, has accepted
the diamond token from Kenneth Webb, son
of the late W. P. Webb and of Mrs. Webb,
who lives in Sydney. Eira is the elder daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. D. Boyd, of Brisbane.
There will be seventy hostesses at the
Matrons’ Ball on August 2, and more debs,
will come out of their shells. This function
has been in cold storage for a year or two, and
everyone—especially those invited —is glad that
it has been revived. The debs, include Mar-
jorie Kent, daughter of the Bill Kents, of
Jondaryan, Jessie Mitchell (her grandfather was
the late W. W. Hood), Cecil Donaldson, Mary
Douglas (granddaughter of T. C. Beirne),
Roslyn Tozer, Edna Buchanan, June McCul-
lough and Annis Mathewson. The hall at the
South Brisbane Tech, will provide the setting.
A delightful place, which lends itself readily to
any decorative scheme. When the century was
young all the best balls were held there.
Jean Alford and Billy Marwedel, who first
thought of being wed in Townsville, have
changed their minds, and will be married at
St. Peter’s Church, Southport. Billy is a
brother of Fay Marwedel the journalist.
Gertie Kemp, a mighty horsewoman, is
Equestrian Queen in a competition now being
launched. Members of the Equestrian Club
are her warm supporters, and the unusual enter-
tainment held at her home drew a large crowd:
There were bullock-riding, buckjumping and
whip-cracking, and some of the lasses showed
themselves superior to the lads.
Marie Baker, only daughter of the late Rev.
E. Baker and Mrs. Baker, of Gatton, has
become Mrs. Bill Jackson, of Macwood
station, St. George. The Albert-street Methodist
Church was the setting.
The Y.W.C.A. rooms were bright when the
voluntary workers were entertained. Among
them were the “thrift workers,” a group of 20
who, among them, collect £lOO a week. The
president, Mrs. F. B. Hammond, aided by
pretty Dorothy Rae, the general secretary, made
everyone feel at home.
The Jewish community welcomed Ruth Por-
trate home. Ruth showed her appreciation by
singing several songs. Her voice is even better
than it was when she left these shores three
and a half years ago.
There are to be 30 debs, at the United Ser-
vice Ball, and 45 at the Catholic Ball! What
is a girl to do with all these lovely little things
emerging from the schoolroom and captivating
the eligibles?
Ethel Bage arrived by car from the south,
and said she’d had a “lovely” trip, though
floods were met with and a cloudburst was
narrowly dodged. It took the lady 11 days—
the floods delayed her a little —to do the trip
from Melbourne. She is staying with sister
Freda, principal of the Women’s College.
A combined farewell, arranged by the
Mothercraft Association, the National Council
of Women and the Lyceum Club, was given
to Dr. Phyllis Cilento, who is making her home
in Canberra. For six years Dr. Cilento has
lived in Brisbane; the Mothercraft Associa-
tion owes its existence to her, and her radio
talks and writings on the care of children
have been of inestimable value to Queensland
women. Over 100 were at the farewell.
Pretty Rosalie Frankel, pianist and composer,
is up from Melbourne and is staying with her
uncle and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. Philip Frankel.
She is writing the libretto of a musical comedy.
The golden-haired girl whom the old
“Courier” knew as Nancy Echlin, and who
now is Mrs. Eric Feldt, is coming down from
New Guinea to stay with her parents, Captain
and Mrs. Dick Echlin. Nancy’s mother was
one of the Warren Whites, and a sister of
Brudenell White. Grandfather Warren White
was a baronet; son Jack, who now lives at
Tambourine Mountain, inherited the title, but
neither he nor his father ever used it.
_ Mrs. Albert Webster, of Perth, is over on a
visit to her sister, Mrs. Norman Gow, and
Mrs. R. M. Gow brought out her best tea-
cups for a party in her honor. There was
bridge, and sweet-peas and roses made the
reception-rooms fragrant and colorful.
The Limbless Soldiers will benefit from a
bridge and musical afternoon to be held on
the Manunda on July 13, with the Lady
Mayoress as president.
Mrs. Baring Gould is down from Penang
with her small son Alistair. They were greeted
on the wharf by Julian, aged eight, who has not
seen the younger brother for awo years. Mrs.
Baring Gould was Nancy Macnaughton,
daughter of Justice and Mrs. Macnaughton,
who gave up a promising career for matrimony.
The Morell lady and daughter Sheila have
returned to Melbourne. They gave another
pinner-party before leaving—they entertained
incessantly during their Brisbane visit, most ol
the Beaudesert squattocracy being represented
at their parties.
John Richards, son of Prof, and Mrs. H. C.
Richards, our latest Rhodes scholar, is off to
the Cold Country in August. Early next year
his parents, with sister Peggy, will go across
for a trip.

EVERY COUCH
IS A CALL FOR
COUCH CURE
A WOMAN'S
LETTER
The social thing to do on Sunday was
to go to the Swinsons’ musicale. The
long white-walled music-room at The
Cottage, Turramurra, made an ideal
auditorium for Athos Martelli’s ’cello,
Nora Williamson’s violin, Elsa Corry’s
golden notes and the brilliant accom-
paniments of Mildred Hill and Muriel
Edsall.
Early arrivals had a chance to look
with envy at the Chinese prints on the
walls and the old-English china on
cabinet and mantelpiece. Branches of
poinsettia flamed from an old Chinese
vase; lupins spilled their beauty from
a silver bowl, and sweet-peas, violets and
roses were met in unexpected places. The
party overflowed on to the verandahs.
The hostess smiled under a wide-
brimmed hat, and the Acting Governor’s
wife had a posy tied with a silver riband.
The Alexander Gordon lady listened atten-
tively to Elsa, who is to sail for Europe
in the Port Chalmers. The Robert
Dixsons were prompt arrivals, so was
knight Tom Bavin, but the padre Mick-
lems had to leave early. Phillip Game
sat near the A. T. Andersons. The
Budges, the A. J. Warrys and the John
Massie couple were just a few who en-
joyed the music, the tea and savories, and
later the drive home on an evening as
soft and still as one in mid-spring.
Sydney may have a harbor and a
bridge, but it hasn’t a curling club.
Melbourne has, and the Vic. team on
its way to play Maoriland gave Scots
in Sydney a thrill by meeting them in
a game at the “Glassy.” Curling is played
on an ice rink as smooth as glass. The
curls, or stones, are of granite, and
weigh 441 b. The players (as it seemed to
the onlooker who was neither Scottish nor
a curler) twirled the little handle, very
like a beef hook, and the stone curled its
way to the tee at the other end. From
here the skips, or captains, called to the
soopers (Scots for sweepers), who, using
straw brooms, cleared the ice so that the
stone would have a smoother road to
travel. Sooping is a very important
part of the game. The better the sooper
the closer he gets to the stone in action
without touching it.
At times the play was so intense that
only the “whish” of the skaters as they
swept past outside the curling-rink was
heard. At other times the excitement
of the skips affected the whole rink, and
skaters stopped to see what the noise was
about. The visitors won; but will have
to watch their step when they get to
Otago, where Scots outnumber all other
breeds, and where the “Cally” on New
Year’s Day is the festival of the year.
Sydney is now bitten with the curling
craze, and, with curling, the broom and
knitting industries will boom, for every
curler carries his broom with him and
wears woollen socks over shoes or boots.
And the butchering, market-gardening
and licensed-victualling trades will have
cause to rejoice. One is informed by an
acquaintance of Scottish ancestry that,
though the ceremony had to be omitted
on this occasion, no curling match is
complete unless it ends up with a supper
of boiled beef and cabbage washed down
by quantities of hot whisky and water.
After coming away from one of these
functions, it is easy to understand why
curling is known as “the roarin’ game.”
The outsider, when he hears a curler
speak of his “Ailsa Craig,” scents
romance, but this is only one of the many
intriguing names that the curls are known
by; Burnocks, Carsphairn Reds and
Crawfordjohns are a few of the others.
They take their names from the quarries
they come from.
Mrs. Norman Lowe has hurt her knee ;
that’s why she couldn’t come to the
Royal Zoological Society’s dance. This
was held at the Forum Club, and, as
usual, all the other ’ologists in Sydney had
earmarked the date. There were jolly
millers and balloon dances, and a cup of
coffee for even the latest comer. The Le
Soeufs were there, she swirling cerise
georgettes ; Museum Director Anderson
and his wife held a little court between
dances; Mrs. G. F. Smith brought a
young daughter, Meg, who enjoyed it all
as much as her mother. Joyce Allan was
secretary of the flutter; birdman Neville
Cayley and Dr. Marie Bentivoglio were
among the dancers. The medical John
McGeorges, her cavalier cape of silver
cloth much admired, were the centre of
a group that talked plays and playwrights
in the intervals when the bandsmen came
up for air.
Here is Jocelyn, elder daughter of the
Poynter lady. Miss Poynter very early
decided that her mission in life was to
help Sydney women to express their in-
dividuality in their clothes. She still has
this ideal, and on her recent visit to
Europe made a further study of line,
color and types. Now she is designing
for Cinesound, and the frocks worn in
“Strike Me Lucky” owe their charm to
her imagination.
Social and musical Sydney turned up
for Dr. Bainton’s first appearance with
the orchestra. The former came in cars,
the latter mostly in goloshes. Many
wouldn’t have come at all, if it hadn’t
been for the big white ’bus that for the
first time ran from Wynyard up the hill
to the Con. The night was cold ; the dress-
ing was uninspiringly wintry till Acting-
Governor Street and his wife arrived ;
then her rose-sprayed silver lame wrap
ravished the eye. Ailsa Cullen sat with
her father, her eyes as sparkling as his
order. Chief Justice Jordan’s lady wore
mulberry velvets. She came with Mr.
and Mrs. C. L. Jones. Mrs. Jones’s
black toe-length velvet coat was topped
with a snug-fitting elbow-length fur cape.
Mrs. Kuraz sat in luscious mink ; Mrs.
Earp in burgundy velvets. Jean Drum-
mond, in pink floral taffetas, and Charlie
Bryant’s musicianly sisters, one in floral
lame, the other in rich blue velvets, were
others who listened appreciatively.
Sydney has become interested in family-
trees, and the Genealogists’ Society’s
Exhibition is to blame. This was the
most surprisingly successful show of the
week, and soon those who have dis-
covered who their 16 great-great-grand-
parents were will be playing the Earl’s
game—asking their friends if they can
name theirs straight off. Peers are said
to do this at dinner parties when con-
versation lags.
The romantic found the coats-of-arms
of the Knights of the Round Table and
of Arthur (his has 13 gold crowns on a
blue shield) far more intriguing than
those of N. S. Wales notables and
early Governors. In addition to trees
and heraldry, there were historic odd-
ments to hold the eye. The Scotch sec-
tion, with its tartan-hung panel, was very
popular; a sampler stitched and signed
“Matilda Weston, Her Work, May 20,
1835” attracted the needleworker. But
the quaintest document of all was the
marriage bond license whereby Richard
Hill in 1794 bound himself to pay the
Bishop of Meath (not the girl) £5OO in
good and lawful money if he broke his
marriage compact with Mary Mathews,
spinster. Very close to it came the
pictures of Gretna Green, the Smithy
and the Anvil, and a copy of a marriage
certificate issued at this historic mart.
Much of the success of the exhibition
was due to Miss
Mary Yeo, the only
woman Fellow of
the Society.
Miss Roseby,
principal of Red-
lands, is a happy
woman these days.
The school is cele-
brating its 50th
birthday, and hun-
dreds of its old
girls turned up to
the ball at Hor-
derns’ last week,
and again to the
c o m m e moration
services. At the
ball, Miss Roseby,
in silver-patterned
crepes, entertained
a large party, but
still had time for a
word and a smile
with the girls, who,
without exception,
slipped away from
their partners some
time during the
evening to offer
good wishes and
congratulations.
If you are feel-
ing at all blue, take
a dose of “The
Wind and the
Rain,” now at the
Cri., where Joce-
lyn Howarth is
starring. The sheath of black velvet
she wears in the second act has the new
square neckline drawn down at the
corners with diamond clips, and is allur-
ing to the nth degree. Her emerald-
green frock in the last has the fascinat-
ing cape sleeves and the huge bow (it’s
black) at the throat which is all the rage
at the moment.
Nearly every woman in the audience
wore velvet, in coat, in dress or in both.
Mrs. T. H. Kelly’s long coat had white
fur collar and elbow-length cuffs. Mrs.
Sep. Levy’s coat was pedigreed squirrel.
Mrs. Howarth, very proud of her daugh-
ter, sat with Mrs. W. Parker and Mrs.
W. Weeks, and Mrs. Minchin, whose
Patricia is in the cast, was accompanied
by husband and son Lester. Gretel Bull-
more’s black velvet coat was toe-length,
and Mrs. E. J. Tait, in jade green,
brought daughters Mrs. Jimmy Bancks
and Mrs. Byron Wrigley for company.
Blanche Best, of Melbourne, came with
Mrs. John Collins. Mrs. Llewellyn
Rees’s black laces were almost hidden
beneath her ermine coat, and daughter
Gwen’s black velvets were enlivened with
green tulips.
All poet Hugh McCrae’s daughters are
blessed with good looks. Rose (“Smee”),
the youngest, who married Harrington
Morris the other day, has very beautiful
eyes and an elfish face that gives her a
fascinating individuality. The bride’s
frock of an ivory woollen material was
of the Russian tunic variety, her hat a
halo affair of ivory felt, and her posy
of wallflower and mignonette. Two
nieces, Rosemary and Janet Cow per,
also ivory Russianish, ’maided, their
hands filled with golden blooms. The
Rev. R. O’Brien blessed the vows, which
were exchanged in historic St. John’s,
decked with roses, sweet-peas and
poppies from the famous Macarthur
Onslow gardens. Rejoicings were at the
Arthur Macarthur Onslow home, The
Grove, where Mrs. McCrae’s mulberry
crepes met with approbation.
Never has a one-year-old had such a
birthday party as Mount Arcadia, the
Smith Family hospital at Parramatta.
Guests rolled up in hundreds all laden
with toys and fruit, cakes and sweets for
the youngsters. The gifts to the hospital
read like a fashionable wedding list.
Wrought-iron gates, a dairy herd, a
Union Jack and a club flag from the
Scouts and decorative panels from lead-
ing Sydney artists for the walls of the
boys’ ward. Still desperately needed are
socks, sandals and pyjamas for the kid-
dies and rugs and bedside tables for the
nurses’ quarters.
Roland Wakelin’s exhibition at the
Macquarie Galleries had a great kick-off.
The- Lud Mayor presided ; John Moore
introduced Acting-Justice Maxwell, who
opened it. The room was filled with
Sydney’s best-knowns. Mrs. Rodney
Dangar, who was at the private view,
came again on Wednesday, with pink
camellias pinned in her silver foxes and
a curling white quill in her black hat.
Theo Proctor and Mrs. Wakelin wore
black ; Mrs. A. T. Anderson had a curl-
ing feather in her hat, both blue. Bea
McDonald showed how attractive a white
Angora Breton sailor can be when worn
at the right angle, above a black cos-
tume, and Joy Chisholm how equally
attractive a black velvet Breton sailor is
with grey tweeds. Artist Maud Sher-
wood’s blue coat matched her eyes and
buttoned high to the neck. Mrs. C. L.
Jones’s coat and hat matched the sprig
of daphne she pinned in a swirl of silver
fox, and Mrs. Maxwell’s costume was
all brown. The woman who, look-
ing at “Arrival of the Blue Express,”
said “A prosaic subject, well done,” re-
minded one of Kipling’s “Romance
brought up the nine-fifteen.”
Berenice Montgomery’s cure hat added
to her attractiveness when the Orsova
arrived last week. Berenice has been
studying at Trinity College, where she
went by way of a scholarship from All
Hallows’, Brisbane. She is an L.R.A.M.
and a F.T.C.L., and she has had the
distinction of playing before Prince
George and the ex-King of Greece at
the home of the Duchess of Rutland.
The Duchess, too, painted the Austra-
lian’s portrait, and gave it to her before
she left England.
Peggy (Margaret) Warren is wearing
a gorgeous diamond cluster put on her
finger by Peter Blundell, of Wabur
station, Queensland. Peggy is the only
daughter of the late Dr. Charles Warren,
of Woollahra, and of Mrs. Warren, of
Moonameena station, Bingara, and Peter
is the only son of the P. A. Blundells, of
Coorparoo, Brisbane.
The first of Denzil Batchelor’s talks
on Modern Drama took place last week,
and the Independent Theatre’s clubroom
was crowded. Mr. Batchelor, who has a
friendly manner, knows all literary Lon-
don, and his remarks are interestingly
personal. Mrs. W. H. Mackay, Mrs.
Dansey, Mrs. Tom Horton, the Ranken
sisters, Mrs. David Knox and Bea
McDonald were among those who
listened.

Chatter
Grey clouds and a suspiciously warm
breeze sent a large crowd out to the
Grand National prepared for the worst.
It eventuated just before the sixth race,
when bookies vainly wooed empty Flem-
ington lawns and only those with a firm
faith in their judgment or intuition
scurried across to the tote. Margaret
Finlay and Mrs. M. L. Baillieu were a
striking pair, both in dark-green. Together
also were Mrs. Frank Andrew, in black,
and her daughter, Mrs. Andrew Chirn-
side, who was wrapped in a fur coat.
The sumptuousness of Mrs. Dudley
Brunton’s fur collar enveloped even the
split top of her little corded velvet hat.
Mr. and Mrs. Don Swanson, she in a
black coat and small ribbed velvet hat,
were accompanied by their daughter
Mollie, whose coat was collared with lynx.
Mrs. Roy Chambers, in a tailored suit,
and Mrs. J. F. Williams, in a nonchalant
scarlet jumper worn with an iron-grey
suit and rakish little cap, accompanied
their medico husbands. Shoulder epau-
lettes upon Mrs. Kingsley Dawborn’s
black coat were the destiny of twin silver
foxes.
Mrs. Willie Craig’s white hair was
attractive against the collar of her brown
coat. Ruth Bullen was in blue; Betty
Bellair’s black suit covered a berry-red
blouse, and Pat Hammond’s fox lay over
one shoulder of her smoky-blue tweeds.
Betty Matear’s coat was a vivid splash
of tomato. Next to Mrs. Ernest Hey-
manson’s violets and battleship grey
color scheme were criss-cross black-and-
grey stripes and caracul motifs, worn
by Mrs. Hilton Wood. Mrs. Robert
Nathan’s mink and Mrs. Swatz’s cocoa
ermine were amongst the most magnifi-
cent fur coats. ’Cellist Edmund Kurtz
was among the men who went hatless
notwithstanding the weather.
Grand National Week is packed with
luncheons, dinners, teas and dances, so
the Tom Grahams decided to vary their
friends’ programme with a picture-party
on the first race night. Saturday-night
habitues of the Regent, South Yarra,
looked for another show, or else stayed
at home and listened to the cricket, for
the Grahams had acquired the whole
theatre. First releases were screened, and
a buffet supper was served in the foyer
in the interval. The hostess’s black
velvet gown swept into a train and had
a shimmer of pink under its lace yoke.
The Geoffrey Grimwades, the Harry
Oliphants, Dr. and Mrs. Rex Sweetnam,
the Jim Cooks, the Ivo Whittons, Vi
Temple-Smith and Dorota Flatau were
a handful of the 250 who accepted in-
vitations.
A G.-H. car, with its important blue
headlamp, was parked outside Nicholas
Building while the Joy Bells Ball occu-
pied the Rex. General Grimwade, his
chest obliterated with medals, brought
Mrs. Grimwade, who was the com-
mittee’s acting vice-president. The v.-r.
table in its flower-filled arbor was
covered with a magnificent lace cloth,
and even the wineglasses were decorated
with fragile wreaths of violets. The Hon.
Sara Vanneck, who was presented with
a woolly kangaroo from a tray of favors,
danced in brown lace with Captain Bar-
bour. Mrs. Wallace Mitchell wore black
velvet, and Mrs. Barry Thomson moon-
stone-blue lace. Mrs. Fred Armytage
was in black, with diamonds sparkling in
her pendant. Mrs. Beatrice Leach had
a scarlet lining to the cow! neckline of
her windblown silver lame. Mrs. A.
Silk’s lovely white gown clung like an
extra skin and flew a cunning little cape
with serrated edges. Betty Walker’s ice-
blue swished into a train and derriere
tail-wings. Louise Lovely, in a tulle
dress like a whisk of pale-pink meringue,
got amazing prices for scores of gum-
nut bears, monkeys-on-sticks and jingly
toys.
Mrs. J. W. Wall was tall and elegant
in sea-green and a tiara. Linda Smith
chose black velvet, and Ivy Kirby was a
picture of grace in her peacock-green
with spiderwebs woven upon the
shoulders. Mrs. P. H. Locke was
escorted by son Stanley, who is on a
visit to Vic. after 16 years in Detroit.
Lorna Keene’s pale pink was splashed
with silver. Julie Thomas wore a twinkly
diadem with her black velvet, and Lur-
line Urwin plied a tray of favors in sky-
blue with frivolous cape and train.
Agnes Doyle arrived after “Fresh
Fields.” As she and her escort waited
for the lift they met the v.-r. party
descending. Lord Huntingfield promptly
recognised little Una Pidgeon of that
afternoon’s matinee, and he and his lady
stepped aside to shake hands and offer
spontaneous congratulations.
Lady Huntingfield opened the display
of labor-saving devices in the lower
chamber of the Town Hall. It was an
unenviable task, for on the fringe of the
crowd in both rooms were people who
couldn’t hear and would talk. Also un-
comfortable for the vice-regal lady was
her tour of inspection, though, owing to
their commanding height, she and the
Hon. Sara Vanneck managed to see some-
thing over the heads of the multitude.
Very varied were the exhibits. There
were an automatic tea-caddy which,
when poked, let fall a teaspoonful of its
contents; a peasheller; an autodry,
which seemed to do everything a laun-
dress does but iron the clothes; iron-
on stocking patches for the heels of silk
hose, and demonstrations of dyes which
will make dark materials light as well
as the other way round. Reversed also
was the procedure at the cream stall.
Here there was a useful hint for the
woman who has no sweet prepared when
her husband brings home an unexpected
guest to dinner. She opens a tin of
fruit and, with the aid of a simple appa-
ratus like a pump, can make cream by a
backwards method from butter, water
and a little powdered or fresh milk.
Women whose beauty-sleep is spoiled by
snoring husbands made a discovery on
the surgical-patents stand. Snore pre-
ventives are little wire gadgets guaran-
teed to fit any nasal organ which can
be coaxed or bullied into wearing one.
Experts and the newest waving mach-
inery were at the services of the woman
who can stand being “permed” in public,
and the “palmometer” did a great trade.
The Harrison Moore lady was one of
the few who registered the limit for mag-
netism and 90 p.c. for a sense of humor.
Proceeds went towards the Pioneer
Women’s Memorial.
The American colony made merry on
Independence Day with a dinner-dance.
But there were preliminaries like cock-
tail parties ; the Norman Picots gave one
in their own home, to which they invited
30 guests. In honor of the stars and
stripes the chef at the Alexander tackled
fried chicken, clam chowder and pump-
kin-pie, the first-mentioned being the
greatest success, for the U.S.A. produces
a special variety of pumpkin and clam.
The dining-room walls disappeared be-
hind American and Australian flags,
while miniature flags poked their heads
up among red, white and blue flowers.
The American Consul and Mrs. Dye,
she wearing blue-grey lace, sat at the
head of the largest table. Black was
popular with the women guests: Mrs.
Picot was in black ninon, Mrs. Herbert
Allen mixed black and white, Mrs. Charles
Hartman wore cleverly moulded black
chiffon and Mrs. Sammy Pierce chose
a foil of black georgette for her blonde
coloring—the dress was cut on the cross
with an elaborate ornamentation of
crosswise pin-tucks. After dinner the band
turned on its best old and new Ameri-
can dance music.
Owing to so much centenary talk we
are all developing an interest in the his-
tory of Melbourne and tales its old build-
ings could tell. At the corner of Exhi-
bition-street and Little Collins-street
stands an old delicensed hotel. Built in
1842, it is a building of pleasing design
in deep cream with green shutters ; from
its front portal there now swings a sign,
Toby Tavern. Our Broothorn portrait
is of Mrs. J. R. Duigan, Toby’s chate-
laine, whose culinary art is responsible
for the attractive dinners and luncheons
one may procure in what was once the
taproom. Here Adam Lindsay Gordon
and Kendall drained many a tankard.
Gordon often stayed at the hotel and
stabled his horse in the yard, long since
built over. It’s a coincidence that his
statue was placed only a block to the
east of one of the poet’s favorite haunts.
Out of sympathy for the Blue Triangle
movement, the Firm lent the Comedy
Theatre and sanctioned a special “Fresh
Fields” matinee. As hon. promoter
Grace Lane was a tower of strength to
the Triangle committee, for she was full
of enthusiasm and encouragement (she
and Jane Wood are among the most
popular theatricals to have visited Mel-
bourne for many a year). As hon.
organiser Mrs. Tutton was a ball of
energy. Her speech of thanks after the
final curtain was made in a gown of
almond-green satin and a cocoa fox
slung over one shoulder. “God Save”
was sung as a solo by Kathleen Goodall.
Flowers decorated the front of the circle
where the vice-regals sat enthroned, and
the balustrades of both boxes. Mrs.
George Chirnside was noticed in one,
and Mrs. Charles Nodrum entertained
friends in the other. Lady Huntingfield,
who stands upon no ceremony, removed
her hat during the first act. Her family
has a sweet tooth, and considerably
lightened the tray of dainty baskets car-
ried by one of the girl sweet-sellers,
Pictured here by Ronald Esler is Mrs.
Wilfred Brookes, who, with eight assist-
ants, organised the selling of flowers.
Mrs. Brookes is English, but has lived
in Australia since her marriage. Her hus-
band is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Herbert
Brookes. The Wilfred Brookes couple
have a spn and heir, aged four and a half.
The Albert-street Con. made Florence
Austral and John Amadio the nucleus of
an evening reception. There’s a spice of
pleasant informality about the Albert-
street parties ; the couple to be honored
arrived with so little fuss that Fritz Hart
searched for his wife in the entrance hall
with “Jessie, Jessie, where are you? Your
guests have arrived.” Mrs. Hart was
there, but she had got wedged into a
group of old students. In Mr. Hart’s
introductory speech he touched on the
Con.’s long association with the two
stars. The first time he heard Florence
sing was when he, as adjudicator at Bal-
larat, listened to her as a youthful com-
petitor in soprano events. Another
adjudicator heard her in contralto sec-
tions, for, with gay abandon, she
entered for everything. Among guests
who listened to a musical programme,
chattered over coffee and danced in the
gallery were the Leslie Middletons, Dr.
and Mrs. Reg. Ellery, Mrs. Hugh Linaker
Jnr., Nancy Reid, who wore a white fur
coat over her satin frock; Miss Bertha
Monks, in beautifully fitting parchment
velvet; Ada Summers, in dusky pink ;
Mr. and Mrs. H. E. Spry and Marshall
Sumner.
Perth’s cheery winter:
Fair women and brave men made a sound
of revelry at the Naval and Military Ball.
Red and blue uniforms vied in color with
flags and bunting, and beribboned decorations
outdid rainbow balloons. Mrs. A. M. Mar-
tyn’s fur-edged orchid crSpes and satins flanked
her brigadier-general husband’s trappings to
receive the v.-r. party; the Hobbs lady robbed
a white bunny to touch up her sherry velvet
cape; Mrs. Lionel Carter’s tidal satins were
sprayed with diamente; Lieut. Bryant’s better
half smiled above blackberry-bush georgettes,
and Mrs. A. W. Jacoby combined beige lace
and fur with mirror velvet.
Two of Gordon Bottomley’s verse plays were
the main courses on the bill of fare provided
by the Little Theatre, with Phyllis Harnett mix-
ing the ingredients. “Ardvorlick’s Wife” was
served with the white-robed sauce of the snow
chorus, and “Singing Sands” was garnished
with a surge of waves. Two of Thornton
Wilder’s thumbnail dishes comprised the Con-
tinental savories.
South Perth links hummed with activity for
the W.A.L.G.U.’s shield match, which gave
Perth its initial win in the event. Cheery hats
in parrot blue, reds and greens brightened up
the almost universal brown and grey tweeds.
The Port put on a round of farewells for
the Wilfred Butlers, who sailed eastwards in
the Karoola. The mayoral parlor found Mayor
Gibson, daughter Marion and Dr. and Mrs.
Dunkley combining forces in entertaining; Mrs.
F. Thompson brewed a cup of tea at her
home, and Mrs. Hugall brought out cards
for bridge.
Noel Coward’s “Marquise” wore her grace-
ful frills and furbelows for three crowded
nights at the Rep. Club Theatre. Mrs. Hubert
Momber made merry in the name-part, with
able support from Tom McGregor and Eric
Scott as the Compte and Esteban. The dress-
ing was a delight, and Olive Dean scored again
as producer.
Karrakatta Club members rolled up strongly
for the musicale arranged by Mrs. Frank
Robertson. The Nathan lady, in clinging black
velvets, and Mrs. W. W. Garner, with sleek
black tailored suit, greeted at the portals and
waved the tea-sippers into a hall liberally
splashed with poinsettias, poppies and jonquils.
A line of cars made for Moorlands, the
home of the Percy Roses at Bunbury, to wit-
ness daughter Peggy emerging from sub-
debdom. Mrs. Rose directed affairs in violet
velvets, and Peggy danced in an airy confection
of fluffy white tulle.
Back from their various globe-trottings came
Mrs. J. L. B. Weir and Mrs. Max Rutter, to
be welcomed jointly by Mrs. Donald Tregon-
ning, who parked her tailored beige cloth at
the Embassy. Between rubbers of bridge there
was an interval for tea and music.
Betty, the H. C. Sewells’ blonde chick, has
given her promise to Gerald Blake, of West
Perth.
Adelaide’s parties:
The Bachelors’ Ball was at the Embassy,
where the balcony overlooking the ballroom
was converted into a bar. Dinners and cock-
tail parties had preceded the hop, and the
fourteen bachelors were in merry mood when
they lined up to receive their guests, each with
a red carnation in his buttonhole. Women
friends had decorated the ballroom beautifully.
Students of the School of Mines had their
dance in the Brookman Hall. Scarlet and
gold streamers and hundreds of electric lights
in the same tones looked most effective. Prin-
cipal Reid and his wife received the guests, who
included Prof. Kerr Grant and his better half.
The elder folk played bridge in another room.
The Uni. Dance Club’s hop was in the
refectory. Joint presidents Dr. and Mrs. Rex
Matters received the guests, Mrs. Matters
wearing a pretty white-green-and-red flowered
liberty silk frock. The brightly burning logs
in the huge fireplace attracted the dancers
between times.
Mrs. J. Davidson, wife of Dr. Davidson,
entomologist at the Waite Institute, who left
in the Hobson Bay for London en route for
Denmark on a seven months’ trip, was given
two farewell parties by Mrs. E. A. V. Richard-
son. The first was a dinner at Urrbrae, fol-
lowed by a musical evening and supper. The
second was held in the Uni. Wives’ Club’s
room. There was a big rally of the wives of
professors.
The Pharmacy Ball, held in the Uni. refec-
tory, was a great success. Decorations were
black and gold, the Pharmacy colors, and
supper-tables were gay with Iceland poppies.
President M. C. Moore and his wife received
the guests, Mrs. Moore gowned in black ring
velvet. About 350 were present.
There was a tremendous crowd at the Picca-
dilly for a bridge party in aid of St. John’s
Ambulance. Mrs. M. H. Downey, organiser
and secretary, had reason to be proud of the
result of her labors. During the evening Jack
Rymill auctioned gifts from business firms.
The marriage of the Moulden lady’s youngest
daughter Deborah to M. Knox, of Melbourne,
will take place in September at St. Peter’s
Cathedral.
Tassie’s social doings:
The A.W.N.L.’s presentation to ex-premier
McPhee was quite a big affair. Priminister
Lyons and his wife were guests of honor, and
all the brass-hats of the organisation rolled up
in strength. Mrs. Maty Parker handed over
the gift, a silver tea-service of Georgian design.
The rooms were decorated in purple and
yellow, with autumn foliage, and Mrs. Lyons
gave a short address.
Among visitors who contributed to the
pleasure of our Music Week were pianist
Yelland Richards, soprano Laelia Finneberg,
’cellist Joan Hawley and basso Fred Collier.
Hobart Phil, gave a fine concert, and the
symphony orchestra and Glanville Bishop were
also to the fore.
A very cheery affair was the Kingston Beach
Golf Club’s at-home. There was dancing in
the sunroom and bridge was played upstairs.
Enormous fires kept the cold at bay, and most
of the women wore warm velvets.
Launceston’s Arts Ball was held in the Albert
Hall. Galleries were well filled with on-
lookers, and the floor was crowded with
dancers. Supper was in cafeteria style, and
ballets interspersed the ballroom dances.
His Ex. and Lady Clark attended the Uni.
Dramatic Club’s show, “Marry the Girl,” at
the Royal, and got a good laugh out of it.
G. E. Hodgson, Norman Westbrook, Joan
Courtney-Pratt and Joyce Foster rollicked
through the leading parts. Prof. Pitman was
producer.
Hutchins School staged an end-of-the-term
party in the school gymnasium and other
rooms, about 300 turning up for dancing and
bridge.
There was a good house for the Rep. Soc.’s
performance of Lonsdale’s “The High Road”
at the Royal. Olive Wilton was producer, and
the furnishing of the drawing-room scene, which
is the setting of the three acts, was very effec-
tive. N. P. Booth, as Lord Trench, was the
outstanding figure of the show, but othei
members of the cast gave a good account of
themselves, notably W. E. Fuller. His Ex. and
Lady Clark were there on the second night.
For a dance at Claremont Memorial Hail
business slogans and other advertisements took
the place of flags and flowers, the shivoo
being intended to support the candidature of
the Commerce Queen, Barbara Ellis, for a
carnival in aid of the 8.D.D.1. Dancers were
chiefly the young and the very young.
To Nancy McPhee, daughter of the ex-
Premier, falls the kudos of being the first
woman to qualify for admission to the Tas.
Bar.


THE OTHER FELLOW’S MIND.
Melbourne’s Milk Board
It is too early to pelt bouquets at it.
At present the middleman is scoring as
heavily as under the old system of milk
distribution. Prior to May 1, the farmer
was getting about 6d. a gallon, after
a gallon cartage had been taken off.
The consumer paid 6d. a quart. The
board fixed the price at lOd. a gallon,
delivered at factory or depot, and lid.
in Melbourne.
The smile died from cockies’ faces
when factories increased cartage and
treatment charges to Id. a gallon and
added Id. per gallon to cover cartage
from depot to Melbourne. In Mel-
bourne, retailers paid Is. 6d. a gallon
delivered.
On July 1 the price was increased to
the farmer by fd. per gallon. Simul-
taneously retailers raised the price to
consumers by |d. a quart. Naturally con-
sumers are objecting, but their protests
are not likely to succeed any more than
did the protests of the farmers when they
complained of the higher charges.
The consumer is told the farmers are
benefiting at his expense. As a matter
of fact, in some Gippsland districts
farmers are worse off than before the
board came into operation.
The Milk Board Act fixes the price of
milk in Melbourne. To be just it should
fix a maximum price to consumers as
well as a minimum to farmers, the
latter subject only to stipulated charges
and deductions. At present factories and
depots can ring-in any and every charge
they can think of. —V. E. A. C. (Vic.).
“Write to Melbourne”
The enclosed letter from Australia
House may interest Bulletin readers.
I imagined Australia House might be
interested in the sale of Australian pro-
duce, and I wrote suggesting Morocco
as an excellent market for meat and all
tinned goods. The duty on all goods is
only 12 p.c., and, as Morocco is on the
gold standard, the exchange would be
greatly in Australia’s favor. Here is the
reply, condensed:
I find some difficulty in answering your
letter in view of the fact that the Com-
monwealth Government does not deal in
Australian produce of any kind....
Presumably, since the P. and O. boats call
at Tangier regularly, trade would be done
direct with Australian exporters and not
through London. In the circumstances,
I would suggest that you persuade the
wholesale agent of whom you write to
communicate with the Secretary of the
Department of Commerce in Melbourne,
indicating that he believes there to be a
market for frozen meat, butter, dried and
canned fruits, fresh fruit in season, etc.
He should accompany his letter by
references, including a banker’s reference,
and should indicate what formalities there
are in connection with the import of
goods other than the 12 p.c. import duty.
For what purpose does Australia
House exist? —R. P. (Tangier).
The Diggers’ Landlord
Following on that subleader (B.
16/5/’34) consider the case of C. C.
Greville, of West Ryde (N.S.W.). He
entered into a contract to buy a home in
Five Dock for £BOO. After seven years’
occupancy he vacated the place in May,
1931 ; he had been nine months unem-
ployed. The property about two months
later was sold for £BOO on a nominal
deposit.
Greville paid £32 10s. 9d. deposit and
effected the following improvements:
Back verandah .. .. £32 10 0
Part construction of fence 7 0 0
Paths, garden, etc. .. .. 5 0 0
Total £77 0 9
At the end of June he received a
letter from the Commonwealth Crown
Solicitor demanding payment of £23
Is. lOd. by July 5, failing which “legal
proceedings will be instituted against you
without further notice.”
A soldier-settler’s liability to the Crown
ceases after the Digger gives up his hold-
ing. The ordinary mortgagee cannot or
does not pursue a purchaser in distress
when he has the property handed back.
Then why should the War Service Homes
Commission dun an ex-serviceman in
Greville’s position? In nine cases out of
ten the value of the equity surrendered
is in excess of the amount presumed
to be owing. This is another case where
the Digger is being dunned to death. —

“Licensed” Stations
Obviously, if the writer of “Broad-
casters Don’t Care” (B. 20/ 6/ ’34) had
his way, B-class broadcasting stations
would be precluded from accepting any
advertising. How is the conclusion
arrived at that “few stations can, at any
one moment, reach more than 10,000
listeners”? It would be as easy to
state, and as difficult to disprove, that
not more than 1000 people are reading
The Bulletin at any particular moment.
The Bulletin has its circulation; so
have radio stations, and independent
surveys estimate that 70 p.c. of listeners
tune in to B-class stations.
When did the writer of “Broadcasters
Don’t Care” seek information from
leading B-class stations as to rates of
payment for artists? Did he apply to
2GB? He might have found that in
some instances artists are paid more
than, the A.B.C. rates. And since when
have microphone rehearsals not been en-
couraged? Provision is made for them,
and microphone rehearsals are con-
ducted.
Some of the statements may be near
the mark in the case of some insignifi-
cant B station, but that is no warranty
for such sweeping and unfair statements,
especially when they are coupled with
advertising, for the principal stations are
the ones constituting commercial broad-
casting.
Leading licensed broadcasting stations
welcome investigation, and they welcome
any practicable suggestion by which
broadcast programmes may be im-
proved. In fact, they spend a great deal
of their own money in such investiga-
tion. —A. E. Bennett (N.S.W.).
“Do you think they’ll ever find us here?”
“Who wants to be found?”
The Deadly Footboard
For the fifth time this year Sydney
Tramwaymen’s Union has had to make
the grim entry in its records: “Killed
while employed on the footboard. He
left a widow and four fatherless chil-
dren.”
Sydney is the one city in the world in
which tramway employees are exposed
to daily danger of accident and disease.
In coolie countries the footboard is not
tolerated, yet we are egotistical enough
to boast of our superiority. From 1916
to 1932 accidents to employees totalled
4097, many of them being fatal. From
1923 to 1931 there were 10,228 accidents
to the travelling public, 63 being fatal.
Compensation for those footboard acci-
dents cost the State £47,782. For the
past year there were 3553 accidents to
the public alone, for which the depart-
ment paid £10,548, or .32 p.c. of all earn-
ings. The annual report is discreetly
silent on staff accidents.
Every conductor who is killed costs
the State £B5O in compensation. Every
two deaths represent a little more than
the cost of one modern tramcar. Bought
in the bulk, three deaths will equal two
corridor cars of modern design.
If Mr. Bruxner and Mr. Lang can
only forget their personal dislikes and
political limelighting long enough to
realise that this reform is something
higher than party politics we would
quickly get a programme of reconstruc-
tion of the present rolling stock. This
would provide work for many skilled
tradesmen, add to the asset value of the
State, give greater comfort to the travel-
ling public, result in the more efficient
collection of revenue and save the State
thousands of pounds every year in com-
pensation. Politicians will probably
think that sand-shifting is more im-
portant. — Union Official (N.S.W.).
No, NOT Another!
Mr. Folkard’s case against the Defence
Department (B. 4/7/’34) doesn’t impress
me. His son had a vertebra too many,
just as one may have a superfluous
finger or toe, or even a rudimentary tail.
This extra-lumbar vertebra had been
present from birth, but it would give no
trouble till the boy reached a certain
age. Nor could it be easily detected ;
two X-rays failed to reveal it.
On the other hand, the boy was fed,
clothed and educated by the Government
for four years. Even pocket-money was
provided for him. When it was revealed
that he should never have been passed
medically fit he was not immediately
discharged, but was permitted to com-
plete his studies at the R.A.N. college.
The authorities, without doubt, wished to
equip him for civilian employment, as
well as was in their power; they could
not be expected to assume responsibility
for a congenital abnormality, and incur
the expenses for the operation necessary
to remedy it.
I agree that the department should
supply the youth with references to assist
him in finding employment; further,
that it should actively help him in his
search. It should do the same, for that
matter, for all officers and men who pass
from the R.A.N. into civil life. Its
failure to do so is a significant indica-
tion of the gulf which separates the
seagoing forces and the shore bureau-
crats.
Except in refusing to supply young
Folkard with references (which I cannot
understand), the Defence Department
does not seem to have dealt harshly or
unjustly with him. Far different was its
treatment of Alan Casey. The cases are
poles apart, and much harm could be
done by bracketing them together. I say
definitely: “No, not another!” —R. A.
Navy (N.S.W.).
Dodging the Issues
N.S.W. Education Minister Drum-
mond’s committee of experts, appointed
almost a year ago to review the Gov-
ernment’s schooling system —there were
32 at first and 70 at the end —has come
to light with a couple of recommenda-
tions. It proposes that a “council of
secondary education should be consti-
tuted” and that its own report should be
referred to this council for another. It
doesn’t seem much for 11 months’ work.
It was announced when the committee
was formed that “an important aspect
would be the effect of examinations upon
the health of children.” The Minister
states that no report has reached him
on this subject. With regard to the alle-
gation that the present curriculum is
dominated by University requirements
for matriculation, the committee says
only that it “is a matter on which
further discussion may profitably ensue.”
It has nothing to say about standards
of education in the different States,
although students holding the N.S.W.
leaving certificate and wishing to
follow a course overseas —at the Uni-
versity of London, for instance —find
that they have to sit for a matriculation
exam. Adelaide, Melbourne and West-
ralian certificates are accepted as ful-
filling the conditions.
The Bulletin said when the com-
mittee was named that nothing could be
expected of it. Only too true! What is
needed in our own Government schools
is less cramming for examination
purposes and greater endeavor to fit the
individual for the place he will have to
fill when schooldays are over. —B. J.
(N.S.W.).
Another Denial
W. Watson, M.H.R. (B. 27/6/’34),
may take the unction to his soul that
he was elected “on his merits,” as it
were, but after associations
with a considerable number of
electors in general, and for
myself in particular, I deny the
imputation that we were dis-
satisfied with our party—the
Nationalists. We had no alter-
native but to give W. WatsoL
our second preferences, or
stultify our first vote as
Nationalists by renewing Jack
Curtin’s lease to a seat at Can
berra. It was about the mos :
difficult issue that confronted
an elector —one of Secession’s
leaders carrying the Nationalist
banner, an Independent whose
power for good or ill was
known to be negligible, and
a talented Labor man. That.
W. Watson writes M.H.R.
after his name is a criterion,
not of weariness with party,
but of that obfuscation that
won’t let a voter see a way out
of an impasse by voting for
the best man without damag-
ing his party.
—W. C. Thomas t W.A.).
Overmanned Be Hanged!
I have little patience with
those who say our N.S.W.
civil service is overmanned.
True, we have nine police and
three petty-sessions clerks in
our small town of 3000 inhabi-
tants ; but consider the work
they have to do. Here is a
Sunday’s record.
The police started their day’s work
before 11, and visited some of the small
back-street shops. They caught one mis-
creant selling apples and another selling
toffee. The toffee-seller lost her husband
rather tragically, and rather than apply
for the dole started her little shop; but
what does that matter? Two up to the
police already.
In the afternoon they had a haul.
There was a football match, and after
the game both teams resorted to the
hotel for hot showers and a rub-down.
There was nothing to indicate that they
had gone there for any other purpose,
but everybody found in a hotel on Sun-
day is assumed to be guilty of some
offence until the contrary is shown.
Thirty-one summonses out of that lot,
including the publican.
Later on, one of the police assumed
plain clothes and visited Murphy’s pub.
Murphy has only just taken over, and
does not know the police by sight yet.
There was no one except Murphy on the
premises. The policeman asked for and
obtained a drink. Thirty-four up.
About midnight another desperate
criminal was captured. His story was
that he had been to call on his girl, and
found on leaving that his tail-light
wouldn’t act. As he had 20 miles to go,
and all the garages were shut, he started
off without a tail-light. Thirty-five in-
formations to be laid the following day ;
thirty-five summonses to be made out
and delivered. Splendid force, the police!

Miss PennycuicK’s Nightie.
BY J. B. BLAIR.
STAGNANT WATERS, the Great
Detective, stood up impatiently.
“Pneumonia is not in my line,” he
said ; “you’d better get a doctor.”
“Let me explain,” replied Ebenezer
Postlethwaite. “I’m not asking you to
cure Miss Pennycuick’s pneumonia. I’m
asking you to ascertain the cause.”
“You speak in riddles, sir. My hobby
is the solution of crime. I unravel mys-
teries. I solve ciphers. I bring mis-
creants to justice. The diagnosis of
disease, although, no doubt, a very re-
putable occupation, and one calling per-
haps for the exercise of a certain amount
of skill and intelligence, does not come
within my ambit. I”
“Hear me out,” interrupted the other.
“This is a case which calls for your best
endeavors. The doctors may cure the
poor girl’s pneumonia, but I think that
you alone can unravel the baffling mys-
j tery that surrounds the disappearance of
1 Miss Pennycuick’s night attire.”
“My dear Mr. Postlethwaite,” pro-
tested Stagnant Waters, dropping the
poison bottle with which he had been
toying, “this is past a joke. I am a man
of honor and integrity, and as such
“You misunderstand me,” replied the
president of the Association for the Sup-
pression of Vice. “As I have already
told you, I am chairman of the board of
governors of Straitlace Academy for
Young Ladies, which is situated at Mt.
Lofty. Well, some months ago Miss
Pennycuick, the teacher of deportment,
awoke early one morning shivering with
cold, and —er —well, this is a delicate
matter, Mr. Waters, but, to put it plainly,
the garment which she distinctly recol-
lected having donned the night before
had completely vanished.
“She was naturally mystified, and when
some weeks later the same thing hap-
pened again, and she developed a severe
chill, she reported the matter to the prin-
cipal, Miss Pobjoy.
“Miss Pobjoy was, of course,
astounded. At first she was inclined to
think that Miss Pennycuick was suffer-
ing from delusions, but after the dis-
appearance of the third and fourth gar-
ments she realised that something very
extraordinary was occurring
“Night after night she watched by the
young woman’s bedside. Nothing hap-
pened.
“Miss Pobjoy abandoned her vigil.
Another garment vanished.
“The door and windows of Miss Penny -
cuick’s room were locked and barred,
but still at intervals the poor girl would
awake at daybreak unclad and shivering.
Yesterday, in despair, Miss Pobjoy sent
for me.”
The Great Detective pulled out a
drawer of his crime-index system,
selected a blank card and wrote on it,
“Nightie, one, Miss Pennycuick’s, Dis-
appearance of.”
“I’ll take the case,” he said abruptly.
“You’ll have to arrange for my entry
into the school, and leave the rest to me.”
“I’m afraid that is impossible. Even
if I agreed, and I will not, the principal
would never hear of it. If you have a
j female assistant who could do the obser-
| vation work and report to you, I have
' no doubt that I could make the arrange-
ments.”
“I’d rather go myself.”
“Impossible. As it is I shall be strain-
j ing my conscience a great deal by allow-
! ing your assistant to masquerade. As a
matter of fact, Miss Pobjoy mustn’t even
know that the young lady is an inquiry
agent.”
“Pardon me — detective put in Stag-
nant Waters.
“I mean detective. She wants me to
employ Madame Molineux, the psycho-
analyst and diviner, but I knew the
woman when her name was Smith, and
I have no faith in her. Your assistant
must be introduced as a protegee of
Madame Molineux.”
“What kind of nighties does Miss
Pennycuick wear?” asked the detective.
The great brain was clearly already on
the job. *
“In common with all the staff and girls
of the school she wears a woollen
knitted garment; a gesture of encour-
agement to our great primary industry,
you know.”
“Can you give me the exact dates of
the disappearances?”
1 “I shall get them for you.”
“Very well then. At 3 p.m. to-morrow
a car containing Madame Molineux and
my assistant, Miss Buzzacott, will be
waiting for you at the statue of Venus
on North Terrace. And you may rest
assured. If there is a mystery, there must
be a solution. And if there is a solu-
tion, Stagnant Waters will find it.”
Ebenezer Postlethwaite walked out.
The detective paced up and down the
room. He glanced affectionately at the
portrait of Lucrezia Borgia, restored a
few finger-print photographs to the wall,
and relapsed into the big armchair,
beneath a perfect galaxy of smoke rings.
Punctually at three o’clock a blue
limousine drew up at the statue of
Venus. Mr. Postlethwaite greeted
Madame Molineux austerely, and was
introduced to the pretty young woman
who accompanied her. He then climbed
in beside the chauffeur and the car
moved on.
On arrival at the Straitlace Academy
they were met by Miss Pobjoy, tall,
angular and forbidding.
Miss Buzzacott was a tiny creature,
and looked very small indeed beside the
tall principal and the stout Madame
Molineux. The last-named seemed to
know all about the affair, and assured
Miss Pobjoy that she might have implicit
faith in Miss Buzzacott.
“The child is undoubtedly possessed of
marvellous gifts,’’ she said. “Some of
her achievements *in the past have been
little short of miraculous. But you must
allow her to make her investigations
absolutely unhampered. And, above all,
she must not be hurried.”
Miss Pobjoy glanced at Miss Buzza-
cott. It seemed impossible that this frail
girl could solve the mystery that had
baffled the whole staff for months. Still,
all other efforts had proved fruitless, and
this seemed the last chance.
“She shall have all the assistance it is
possible to give,” she replied.
Miss Buzzacott spoke for the first time.
“Could I,” she asked timidly, “be given
the room next to Miss Pennycuick?”
“Of course.”
Arrangements for the young girl’s
comfort being completed, Mr. Postle-
thwaite and Madame Molineux left the
school and drove back to Adelaide.
During the afternoon Miss Buzzacott
went quietly about her investigations.
She closely questioned Miss Pennycuick,
who was still suffering badly from the
effects of her latest disrobing, and com-
plained of a frightful giddiness.
“To think that it should happen to
me,” wailed the unhappy teacher. “How
can I expect to teach the girls deport-
ment when they know that I am liable to
wake up almost any morning without
a stitch of clothing on me. It’s so
demoralising.”
Miss Buzzacott calmed her as best she
could.
For the first week the young investi-
gator watched patiently night after night
by Miss Pennycuick’s bedside, but
nothing happened to give any inkling of
the solution to the mystery.
Then she changed her tactics, and in-
formed Miss Pennycuick that there was
no need to worry for a further two or
three weeks.
Thereafter she slept in the adjoining
room, but she took the precaution of
boring a peephole in the dividing wall,
so that she could keep an eye on pro-
ceedings during the night.
It might have puzzled Miss Pobjoy if
she had seen her poring over calendars
and reference books; but that worthy
woman, true to her promise, did not in-
terfere with the investigator.
There came a day when Miss Buzza-
cott had been almost a month in the
school. A keen observer might have
noticed an air of expectancy about her
as she anxiously watched the sky towards
evening. It had been dull and cloudy all
day, but she was pleased to note that
towards sunset the sky cleared and gave
promise of a bright moonlit night.
The deportment mistress retired at her
usual hour, and Miss Buzzacott, looking
through the peephole, noted that she was
sleeping soundly, and commenced read-
ing. She had recently started Dumas’s
“Celebrated Crimes” and was then en-
gaged on Vol. XIV.
The night sped by. Ringing out at in-
tervals she heard the G.P.O. clock sound
the hours. Still she read on. Suddenly
she glanced at her watch and hastily
put the book down.
The time had come. If her theory and
her calculations were correct, she was
now about to solve the problem, and
to unmask the mysterious marauder who
had so persistently stolen Miss Penny-
cuick’s nightgowns.
She moved to the peephole and peered
through. Sure enough, her expectations
were realised, and a terrible sight met
her eyes.

In the brightness of the moonlight-
flooded room Miss Pennycuick was sit-
ting straight up in her bed, staring with
transfixed gaze at something before her.
Then mechanically she turned back the
bedclothes and slowly lay back on the
pillow again, with her eyes still staring
at something which Miss Buzzacott, with
her range of vision limited by the peep-
hole, could not see.
For some minutes she lay motionless ;
then a strange thing happened. Turn-
ing over on her side she lay for a moment
face downward, then completed the circle.
This movement was repeated time after
time, each revolution being faster than
the preceding one, until at last the un-
fortunate Miss Pennycuick was gyrating
like the propeller-shaft of an ocean liner.
Miss Buzzacott waited for no more.
Seizing a spanner from her reticule she
rushed from the room and entered the
adjoining chamber.
The poor girl was still revolving
rapidly, and with each turn her woollen
nightdress was being advanced a step
further towards vanishing point. The
unravelled wool was being drawn by
some means upwards, and was disappear-
ing through a hole in the corner of the
ceiling. That portion of the room was
in shadow, and Miss Buzzacott could not
clearly distinguish whether there was an
open trapdoor or merely a small hole.
There was no time to lose. Already
Miss Pennycuick was half-naked, and
the situation called for immediate steps.
Miss Buzzacott grasped her by the
shoulder and stopped her gyrations. The
thread of wool reaching to the ceiling
was drawn taut and snapped.
A dark form appeared at the point
where the thread vanished. Miss Buzza-
cott flashed her torch full upon it, and
threw her spanner with unerring aim.
A body fell to the floor, and lay there,
an inert mass.
Miss Buzzacott drew the bedclothes
over the weeping girl and calmly re-
covered her spanner.
“It was really quite simple/’ said
Stagnant Waters to Mr. Postlethwaite as
the two sat in his North Adelaide flat
the following afternoon. “Almost the
first thing I noticed in Miss Pennycuick’s
room was a small wisp of wool, a few
inches long, hanging from a hole in a
corner of the ceiling.”
“Wait a moment,” said Mr. Postle-
thwaite ; “what do you mean by the first
thing you noticed? You were never in
the school. Miss Buzzacott, your assist-
ant” —
“/ was Miss Buzzacott,” broke in Stag-
nant Waters airily. The Great Detective
was not without his pride, and he en-
joyed the effect his simple explanation
had upon the chairman of the school.
“Impossible! Why, she was a foot
shorter than you. Her features were
altogether different. Her voice....
Why, man, you’re joking.”
“Not at all,” replied the detective
acridly. “My skill in the art of dis-
guise is, I might say, one of the few
points on which I am vain. / was Miss
Buzzacott.”
Mr. Postlethwaite was both astounded
and alarmed.
“You must never let Miss Pobjoy hear
of this,” he gasped. “What on earth
would she say?”
“That is a matter of extreme indiffer-
ence to me. But, of course, if you do
not wish to hear the story”
“My apologies, Mr. Waters. Pray
proceed.”
“Well, until then I had suspected Miss
Pennycuick of swallowing her garments,
but that thread revealed to me the whole
secret. By gaining access to the ceiling
1 could have recovered the lost pro-
perty at once, but I was determined to
capture the miscreant in the act, and
end for ever his nefarious practices.
“For a time I admit I was baffled ;
then I realised the significance of the
list of dates you had given me.
“All the nightgowns had disappeared
on the night of the full moon. During
the past eight months, as you know, six
garments vanished. I discovered that,
on the two occasions when the moon
was at the full and no theft occurred,
the night was dull and overcast. This
gave me the clue.
“In the course of my profession 1 have
embraced many studies which the lay-
man does not necessarily come in touch
with, and I think I may justly claim that
as an authority on arachnology my
reputation is not wholly undeserved.
“I was aware that in parts of Burma
there is a species of spider which un-
winds the silk from the cocoons of silk-
worms, and uses it for lining its nest.
The beams of the school ceiling are of
teak. ‘Would it not be possible,’ I rea-
soned, ‘for such a spider to have been
imported with the teak? And might not
such a spider, finding silkworm cocoons
a negligible quantity in the school, have
adapted itself to circumstances, and have
taken, instead, Miss Pennycuick s
woollen nightie?’ ”
“Amazing! But surely it is one thing
to unwind the silk from a small light
cocoon, and altogether another mattei
to unravel the garment of a sleeping
woman, weighing, shall we say, eight
stone?”
•‘Exactly. That is where the creature s
incredible ingenuity comes in. The zoo-
logical name of this Burmese spider is
Arachne hypnotise, and it is so called
because of its ability to hypnotise the
small birds and insects on which it
preys.”
“But you surely don’t suggest that it
could hypnotise Miss Pennycuick?”
“That is exactly what I do mean. Of
course it would not have been able to
do so had she been fully awake, but the
creature invariably made the attempt
when she was in that borderland state
between sleep and waking.”
“Incredible! ”
“Briefly, the method was this. On the
night of full moon, Miss Pennycuick’s
room was bathed in light, but the
brightest beams passed midway across
her" bed. Towards midnight the spider
descended from his lair, and spun his
web in this bright light. Then he caused
a wisp of gossamer to brush lightly
across the sleeping girl’s face, so that
she was half-aroused from sleep, and
gazed directly at the web gleaming in
the moonlight.
“By running backwards and forwards
across the web. he soon had her com-
pletely under his spell.
“His tactics changed, and he careered
up and down the web, instead of across
it, with the result that Miss Pennycuick
sat up in bed and flung the bedclothes
back. He returned to the centre of the
web and she lay back again, still en-
tranced.
“Then came the climax of the whole
scheme. Darting down, he quickly shore
through a strand of the wool with his
sharp hind legs, scurried back to
the web and commenced to crawl round
and round the outside. Slowly Miss
Pennycuick turned over in her bed. The
spider increased its pace and the girl did
likewise until she was gyrating at a
terrific speed. Arachne hypnotise then
left the web, seized the loose end of
wool and scurried up into the ceiling
with it.
“The rest, of course, was simple. He
merely drew- in the wool, which un-
ravelled as fast as Miss Pennycuick con-
tinued to revolve. Presumably, when all
the wool was safely gathered in, he drew
in his web, and the poor girl ultimately
ceased her revolutions through sheer
exhaustion. Quite simple, you see. But
have no fear, it will happen no more.
A most interesting case.”
“A most astounding case, Mr. Waters.
I cannot thank you too deeply.”
“Nonsense. To a man of my train-
ing it was nothing. The loose end of
wool, the calendar, Miss Pennycuick’s
giddiness why, there was no other
possible solution It solved itself, one
might say.”
Ebenezer Postlethwaite rose to leave,
then spoke nervously.
“You realise,” he said, “that this must
remain a secret between us. If it became
known that I had connived at your
presence in the academy, my position
with the Association for the Suppression
of Vice would be very difficult indeed.”
“You have nothing to fear from me.”
“But what about Madame Molineux?
That woman is bound to talk.”
“She knows nothing about the affair.”
“But when she was at the school she
seemed to know all about it.”
“She was never at the school.”
Mr. Postlethwaite stared. “But I’ve
known Madame Molineux for 30
years,” he said. “I knew her when her
name was Smith. I’m sure I couldn't
have been mistaken. It was surely she."
“It was not.”
“Then who was it?”
Seldom was Stagnant Waters guilty o
using slovenly English, but on this occa-
sion he lapsed slightly.
“It was me,” he replied.
Shopgirl.
Her sombre dress was neat. Her amber hair
Enriched her face. Her youthful, slender
hands
Were lovely as they hovered here and there
To show me buttons —scarlet, smooth, with
bands
Of black. Her voice was restful, deep and cool;
Beside the sea of traffic in the street
That voice—serene and quiet—seemed a pool;
It made the button-counter a retreat.
On each blue sleeve and pointed epaulet
I sew a button, rounded, large and red;
Below the tartan scarf, three more. And yet
I do not sew them with a draper’s thread:
As I attach these buttons I have bought
My tranquil mind with memories is stirred;
For every button is a rounded thought,
And every stitch a shopgirl’s silken word.

“PAGEANT”
by G. B. Lancaster
“The Doughman”
by
Robert Desmond Tate
“JONAH”
by Louis Stone
PAGEANT is aptly named.
It describes the spectacle of
life in the days of Queen
Victoria, in the stage-setting
of Colonial Tasmania. The
characters have all the
glamour of actors in a bril-
liant masquerade. The pages
are packed with dramatic
incidents, told in a masterly
style. Here is History in
the making, told as a
dramatic story of individuals.
A book to read and keep,
to discuss and recommend.
PRICE 6/6. Postage 4d.
It is more than an author’s
brilliant first novel; it is
the first of its kind among
our novelists. It trans-
lates. in terms of the
sharpest realism, an aspect
of life in the raw—in the
sweat and steam, the stealth
and sinister dealings that
may form the atmosphere of
industrial workers. It shows
the insidious effect such
atmosphere may have on
those who breathe it —men
and girls. It shows the re-
action of a girl of clean
character and a man who in
other circumstances might
have been an inspiration to
men. It carries with it a
quick spice of humor and
the softening influence of
romance.
PRICE 6/-, Postage 3d.
The late Mr. John Gals-
worthy said: “I’ve lapped
up your novel, which I think
extraordinarily actual, vivid
and good.” This is an epic
of the city’s back streets.
Jonah is an unforgettable
character, as truly Australian
in his way as any man from
the Bush. The book will
surprise those who now read
it for the first time, by its
dramatic power in telling of
a phase of Australian life
which has almost entirely
vanished.
PRICE 6/-, Postage 3d.

mania seen with the romance

Trousers.
BY HAROLD MERCER.
INEZ loved Tom but hated his trousers.
Things less important than trousers
—which certainly are important —
have wrought human disaster affecting
larger interests than the serenity of a
small household in the outer suburbs ;
and Inez had reached a stage when she
wondered whether she shouldn’t close
the chapter of her romance with Tom.
There was, of course, another man in
the offing.
Even if anyone had known what was
going on in Inez’s mind it would have
been impossible to tell her that trousers
were the basic cause of the trouble. That
would have been an absurd anti-climax (
to the emotional storms which were lead-
ing her towards a decision.
It was a thousand pities that such a
romance as that of Tom and Inez should
be spoilt. It was one of those splendid
affairs in which nothing really mattered
but the mutual affection that transformed
a cottage in the wilderness into a palace,
made even privation, endured in a spirit
of loving sacrifice, happiness. They had
shared an enormous quantity of happi-
ness of that description.
Tom’s love for old clothes amounted
almost to a passion. Tom hated to have
to be careful about what he wore. Five
minutes after his arrival at home he was
in his old “clobber” and at ease.
“You make me ashamed, going about
in those old trousers,” Inez remarked so
often that Tom took it almost as a habit.
“People might mistake you for a
bottle-oh.”
“That’s an idea!” Tom would laugh.
“I might become a bottle-oh and make
real money. The first step to affluence
is to look like one.”
It never occurred to Tom, in spite of
the incessant complaints, that the old
trousers were a real grievance to Inez.
In his own house a man made himself
comfortable and did as he liked.
But the thing really got upon Inez’s
nerves. Being compelled to show some
respect for the clothes which he wore
into town, Tom seemed to avenge him-
self upon those he wore at home. The
suit that had seemed quite respectable
before the arrival of a new one relegated
it to the position of old clothes was in
a few days an untidy remnant of sar-
torial glory.
In desperation once Inez had taken
an old pair of trousers that particularly
offended her and cast them out; but
Tom’s dog, an intelligent animal, recog-
nised its master’s pants in the bush at
the back of the fence and dragged them
in. And Tom put them on, although
their adventures had not improved them.
“Trying to make me respectable, eh?”
Tom would laugh when he found his
old trousers mended and washed. He
would kiss her for thanks; but in a day
or so the trousers would be disreputable
once again.
There came a day when a man paused
in an uncertain way before the gate and,
after a little hesitation, unfastened the
latch.
“Why, Elton!” cried Tom, and hurried
down to meet him. He dragged the
visitor towards the house, crying “Look
who’s here, Inez!”
“I bought a little property down here
—‘Temperley’; you may know it,” Elton
Somers explained. “It’s a spec.; and I
intend to live in it until I sell it. I
heard you were living about here, so I
thought”
“Come right in! It’s fine to see you,”
cried Tom.
Inez seconded his cordiality, but felt
miserable. What was most in her
mind was the comparison between the
sartorial elegance of Elton Somers and
the untidiness of Tom. It humiliated
her.
In other days Somers’s fastidious-
ness had inclined her to laugh at
him. She had decided that the careless
Tom was the better man. Now she felt
irritated with Tom for presenting an
appearance that would give Elton the
impression that they were much poorer
than they really were. She imagined—
it may have been pure imagination—
that there was a look in Elton’s face
that combined pity and triumph.
When Inez came back from preparing
some tea it was to find Tom leaning
back in his chair with one leg cocked
over the other in a manner that showed
a long rent in the trouser leg through
which the bare flesh peeped. Tom was
maddening!
“What d’you think, Ine?” cried Tom.
“Elton’s still unmarried! On his way
to be a crusty old bachelor.”
“I took a trip abroad for a holiday
when —a few years ago,” remarked
Elton. That would have been when he
disappeared after her marriage to Tom.
“I may go again. It’s very interesting—
travelling.”
It was as though he was letting her
know what she had missed.
Tom’s trousers, flaunting poverty, be-
came a positive offence, especially with
Elton a regular visitor. Tom, she felt,
should help her to hold up their end.
“Surely you can get that new suit
now,” she told him. “Then you could
use the one you’re wearing at home —
and you might make an effort to keep it
tidy.”
“Both guesses wrong,” laughed Tom.
“The new suit’s about due, of course,
but that birthday party for little Madge
alters the calendar. I just about did
the coat on that—and the presents.”
Tom was a dear. He would much
rather give little Madge—and herself —
a good time than buy clothes for himself.
“And I spent the trousers on Anzac
Day, meeting the boys,” added Tom
cheerfully. “The new suit’s off for a
while.”
Elton, dropping in often, found her
alone one day.
“You’re happy, Inez?” he asked
suddenly.
“Of course I am! Tom’s a darling.
You’ve got to live with him to know
how sunny his disposition is. He’s never
put out about anything.”
“I’m glad,” he said slowly. “I thought
I saw something in your face that —well,
justified my question. You know, Inez,
I I’m Tom’s friend, but if I thought
you were not happy”
He left it at that. He would have
spoilt everything if his approach had
been abrupt. For Inez, apart from being
fond of Tom, was conventional, and
would have treated any open love-mak-
ing as an insult. But it was flattering
to know that Elton’s feelings for her
had been sufficiently intense to keep him
single. Subtly he managed to let her
understand that his devotion, his money,
were still at her disposal.
The impression he gave in talking
about his experiences abroad was that
he had felt lonely. And he made friends
with little Madge.
“Some day I’m going to run away with
you,” he laughed, playing with her one
evening. “On a big boat—right away,
miles and miles, over the sea.”
“Can I go, daddy?” Madge called
gleefully. And Tom laughed.
Strangely, that trip became a possi-
bility in Inez’s mind. It was dangerous
for any woman to have the thoughts
which came to her. One was that she
was making a sacrifice by remaining
Tom’s wife; another, that, after all, he
did not care much for her.
Before she knew it, Elton’s devotion
ceased to be something to smile at. As a

woman can, she allowed her mind to be
swept by emotional arguments in which
the possible change was for Tom’s sake
and that of the child who linked them.
Madge, growing into girlhood, into
womanhood, must have the refinements
of life For her to grow up to regard as
natural a father who wandered about the
place looking like a tramp was a pros-
pect that appalled.
Elton, with his eternal fastidiousness,
had a new appeal. It was possible, too,
that Inez and Madge were too great
a burden for Tom’s shoulders.
Who would have dared to tell her that
the basic cause of her emotional stress
was a pair of disreputable trousers? It
was probably an inner knowledge that
she was offering herself fallacious argu-
ments that made her desperate about
those pants.
“You must have a new suit,” she told
Tom desperately. “You don’t realise
how ashamed you make me.”
“Inez, darling, I wish you’d drop the
subject. My house trousers may be bad
enough, but they’re not as bad as the
way you talk about them. Anyway, we
had a party last week, and that definitely
postponed my new suit. Unless I have
some luck this week the old pants will
have to hang on until Christmas.”

He went out with a laugh, and left
her st ra" se ly desperate. She was battling
with thoughts all day; when afternoon
came the vision of Tom coming home
again to his dilapidated raiment was
almost a nightmare.
Elton had asked her frequently to have
a look at Temperley. She would go, tak-
mg Madge, and she would say the word
for which Elton was waiting. He had
given her the impression that he could
leave at a moment’s notice. Probably
that would be it; Elton would take her
and Madge right away. She felt so cer-
tain of it that she even left a note for
T°m.
Tranquillity came to her when the deci-
sion was made. The haphazard, troub-
lous life with Tom was to be a thing of
the past; ease and refinement, at least,
would be at her command. Her heart
felt sore at the hurt she was giving to
Tom; she consoled herself by believing
that in the relief from burdens too great
for him he would find consolation,
o ver a well-trimmed hedge Inez saw
the head and shoulders of Elton, stoop-
jn g over some work. He looked up with
surprise and embarrassment.
“I’m doing a bit of a job in the
garden,” he said. He showed none of
the quick gladness of welcome she had
expected ; it was rather reluctantly that
he walked to meet her at the gate as she
made her way there,
She stared at him.
“I’m afraid I’m in rather a messy
condition to entertain a lady,” he laughed
awkwardly.
“I thought we might have a look at
Temperley; but to-morrow will do as
well. I was taking Madge for a walk
in any case,” Inez said lamely.
. To-morrow would be better, he said
with alacrity. Then he grinned sheepishly,

Inez s fled home in time to rip th ' t
foolish note into fragments. She had just
disposed of the pieces when Tom joy-
funy swooped into the house and tossed
big parcels on a chair as he took her in
his arms.
“p ve had my slice of luck'” he cried
“And, to please you, I bought, a suit—
ifs ready-made, but it fits me like a
g i OV e. Those old pants won’t worry
y OU f or a while.”
The way she hugged him, kissing him
again and again, amazed Tom. “How
absurdly women go on about clothes!”
he reflected, grinning inwardly.
Tradition.
BY DOUGLAS DAVISON.
BEDE McNEIL was the victim of a
tradition. A tradition that had its
origin in the far-off time when
his great-grandfather drove over the
Bathurst-road and into the almost track-
less country beyond.
The original Bede McNeil had looked
on the rolling grassland that was his by
grant from his Majesty’s colonial repre-
sentative, and had found it good. Sur-
veying his run for a homestead site, he
came on the blacks’ camp at the Big
Waterhole.
With the breath of the Scotch mists
still in his nostrils, he was indignant that
this wastrel band should have possession
of his land. Confident in his right, clearly
stated on parchment in a beautiful flow-
ing script with seal attached, he stood
before the broad-shouldered, lean-
shanked inhabitants. With his cousin by
his side and half a dozen convict ser-
vants behind him, he was still outnum-
bered more than fifty to one.
He pointed at the sun and swung his
hand in a wide arc. Then he flapped his
hands in the gesture used to drive hens
from the doorway. Growing red in
the face as he realised his inability to
make his signs understood, he shouted,
“Get off my land before next sunset, ye
scum! ”
A young buck, standing a little apart,
did not understand the command or
the insult to his pure ancestry, but he
recognised an angry voice. He shook
his spear and advanced menacingly.
McNeil shot him.
The blacks went, but not before the
sun had risen and set many times, and
lead had searched black ribs and wooden
shafts had quivered in white backs.
The first Young Bede heard the story
full often before his father slept beneath
the soil of Broadmeadows Run. And
Bede the younger proved, when the bush-
rangers held up the homestead, that the
hot sun of the land of his birth had not
thinned his blood.
Down at the men’s hut the second
Young Bede was told how his father had
refused to fight behind a barricaded door,
and how he had stood out on the veran-
dah, red beard bristling, face to face
with Smiler McGee. And how he had
snuggled his immense parrot nose to his
gun-stock and shot the man through the
heart who had dared to dispute, if qply
for an afternoon, a Bede McNeil’s owner-
ship of Broadmeadows.
The second Young Bede McNeil’s turn
came during the shearing strike. He had
refused to be told by any body of men
how his shearing was to be done. The
gates of Broadmeadows had been
picketed and the sheep had panted under
their heavy fleeces.
It was whispered that non-union
shearers were to be imported. Fortified
by whisky, three of the younger strikers
crept in by .night to burn the woolshed.
While his untroubled station-hands
slept, McNeil patrolled the outbuildings
and surprised the strikers. A battle was
fought in the gloom of the shed. The
true story of that fight was never told,
but one of the strikers was carried by
his mates to the camp, and thence to
hospital.
McNeil walked unaided to his home-
stead to have his wounds dressed by his
wife.
Broadmeadows came to the fourth
Bede McNeil.
But the days were peaceful, and as
time went on the leather creaked more
and his hack grunted louder when Mc-
Neil swung into the saddle.
Where the old man and his son and
grandson had had pride in themselves,
this McNeil contented himself with pride
in his ancestry. And, where the earlier
generations loved Broadmeadows with a
hungry love for its fruitfulness which was
theirs by right of conquest, this McNeil
loved the run because, as its owner, he
had a respect from his fellows that he
might not have won unaided.
But the tradition troubled him, and as
his son grew and heard the stirring tales
of the McNeils of Broadmeadows he
wished to add his share to the saga.
One day, at the lamb-marking, McNeil
stood watching.
A loutish lad picked a lamb out of the
huddle and, gathering two feet in each
of his hands, hoisted it to his chest and
walked to where the earmarker stood on
the other side of the rail. The Broad-
meadows mark was snicked in the
lamb’s ear, and the boy went on to where
the tailer stood, knife ready.
McNeil stood too close, and, when the
tailer’s knife cut the sinew, hot, sticky
blood spurted from the stump to his face
and shirt front. Swearing at the boy for

THESE LAST FEW
YEARS
These last few years have, in a marked or lesser degree,
proved to all the wisdom of making some provision for the
future. All of us have experienced the unexpected financial
calls of everyday life, and, while it is impossible to gauge
accurately the needs of the future, it is possible to provide
for them.
A Savings Account costs nothing to open, and can be
opened nearly anywhere in Australia. With it and the regular
saving of money, however small the amounts, adequate pro-
vision for the unexpected calls will be made.

his carelessness, McNeil threw the reins
over his horse’s head and mounted. He
wheeled the horse towards the homestead
for a wash and change of clothes.
And then the boy laughed.
McNeil had no red beard to bristle,
but rage blazed in his eyes. Uncoiling
his stockwhip, he whistled it out behind
him and struck the boy on the face with
the full weight of the thong.
“You did it on purpose,” he roared.
“Get off my run, or I’ll stockwhip you
to the gates.”
The McNeil blood was not yet thin.
The tale was told in the township, and
men laughed.
Four times during the year McNeil
sacked a station-hand ; each time with a
lash of the whip and a threat of more if
the hand was not off the run within an
hour.
Adjoining Broadmeadows on one side
was a wheat farm. It came under the
hammer and was bought by a Victorian
from the timber country, who travelled
overland with his family, driving a five-
horse waggon team. His sapling son
drove a heavy mountain dray with four-
teen bullocks yoked in pairs.
Having left the Victorian timber, Ban-
nock had no use for the bullocks. He
found a ready buyer in McNeil. There
was no need for bullocks on Broad-
meadows, but McNeil knew that if he
used them for the woolcarting the pur-
chase price would not be wasted. A
word to Bertie, of the “Sydney Illustrated
Record,” and a photographer would be
sent to Broadmeadows. A full-page illus-
tration of the dray leaving the woolshed
with a swaying load of bales! “Historic
Broadmeadow Clings to the Old Ways!”
or some such caption, McNeil mused.
Possibly he could get a photograph pub-
lished of himself standing beside the
wrinkled merino Pride of Broadmeadows
XIV.
Billy Bannock offered to work the bul-
locks for a few days for the new owner
and to teach one of the station-hands
to drive. They yoked the animals to a
big single-furrow plough and were
ploughing the sod over a marked-out
area where McNeil was going to sink a
tank.
Riding home in the evening McNeil
turned from the track and rode to where
Billy and his pupil were unyoking. Big
beasts the bullocks were, with slashing
colors that would come out well in print.
“Don’t drive the guts out of them.
Billy,” McNeil ordered, a little roughly.
“I want them to keep their condition.”
“I was brought up with bullocks,
Billy replied evenly, “and I don't need
to be told how to look after them, Bede,”
and he emphasised McNeil’s Christian
name.
McNeil looked at him sharply.
“My name’s Mr. McNeil.”
“I know it is,” Billy said. “Mine's
Mr. Bannock.”
McNeil did not know it, but Billy, too,
was the fourth of his line to farm his own
soil. He was tall and slim, with a shock
of hair that had never known a comb,
and he had incredibly blue eyes. If
McNeil had had more judgment he
would have seen more than blueness in
those eyes, but the generations of over-
lordship of his land had not taught him
the need to gauge a man before he spoke.
Anger caught him by the throat.
“You’re too familiar; I don’t let men
who work for me take liberties!”
“I’m not working for you. The bul-
locks are paid for and I’ve given de-
livery. There’s no need for you to talk
to me as if I were one of your snivelling
station rats. Good evening, Bede,” and
he smiled.
The station-hand stood watching the
tableau. McNeil knew that an account
of the incident would be in the men’s
hut that night, and he lost his sense of
proportion.
“I’ll give you five minutes to get off
the run,” he roared, “or I’ll flog you
from it.”
And as he spoke the lash flew above
his head and then coiled about Billy’s
shoulders.
Billy’s blue eyes widened as if he could
not yet believe what had happened. But
as realisation came he picked up his whip
from where it lay against the plough and
ran to his grazing horse.
McNeil watched him mount, expecting
him to ride toward the boundary gate,
but Billy wheeled his horse and rode
straight at McNeil. He rode with the
reins lying loose on the pommel, and with
both hands he held his bullock whip. Six
feet of supple handle and a twelve-foot
thong that weaved lazily through the
air!
The station-hand saw the start of that
chase —and seven minutes later the men
at the hut, two miles away, saw the
finish. But they did not see Billy’s blue
eyes go cold or McNeil’s bulging eyes
staring with terror, nor did they hear
McNeil scream as, time after time, the
flying greenhide reached out and lightly
kissed him. Kisses that tore shreds of
quivering flesh from his body.
The McNeil blood had at last run thin.
Within two hundred yards of the horse
paddock Billy reined in his horse, and
then rode slowly back on his tracks. But
McNeil gave no pause until he won to
the sanctuary of the homestead.
McNeil’s neck and arms gave evidence
of his wife’s dressings the following
morning when he came out to give the
men their orders for the day..
Long Harry, with a year’s cheque un-
spent and a longing to see Sydney, looked
at McNeil and laughed.
“Been having a bit of an argument,
boss?” he asked.
McNeil’s color rose.
“You’re sacked,” he snapped ; “I’ll
give you an”....
His voice trailed off as he looked at
the grinning men, and he turned away.
“I’ll make out your time and you can
go into town in the mail cart this after-
noon,” he said over his shoulder.'
“When I’m a Man....”
When I’m a man I mean to write a book,
To tell of all the lovely things there are
To make us happy, if we will but look
Towards the brightness of a distant star;
Or else paint pictures, full of glowing hues,
To let men see the beauty round us here:
The sunbeams’ glint on early-morning dews
And, over all, the sky, so true and clear.
Yet music might be better 5ti11.... Soft sound
To speak of quiet sleep with wondrous
dreams,
Or radiant chords for matters more profound?
Yes, music might be best of all,- it seems.
Really, I cannot say which I will take
When I am old enough to make a choice:
Each, as I think, might well be used to wake
The gentle prompting of an inner voice.
But, after all, I might not have the skill
To do these things—and yet, perhaps, my
time
Would still be joyous if I had the will
To let my thoughts ring out their merry
chime.
Others would learn that beauty’s part of life
And might, in turn, adopt the simple plan
Of seeking after that instead of strife.
That, anyway, I’ll do—when I’m a man.

White Ships.
“The white ships are so beautiful
So beautiful so beautiful
From keel to shining spars,”
Deep down, the engines dutiful,
Are singing to the stars.
They pass New Caledonia
From old Manila town,
Where dons of Catalonia
Once ran their eastings down.
They go to California
On "blue and moonless, nights;
From Cairns in Capricornia
To Valparaiso’s heights.
In cabin, room and corridor
They’re filled with , joy and mirth;
By Panama and Labrador,
They’re sailing round the earth.
And, oh! they are so wonderful
So wonderful.... so wonderful,
A-sailing on the sea,
Their engine-rooms with thunder full
And dim with mystery.
Off wintry Patagonia
They storm by rocky coasts;
But. passing Macedonia,
They steal along like ghosts.
The coastguards of Northumberland
Have seen their bright lights go,
With passengers in slumberland
In snowy beds below.
Their lookout’s chants are memories
That Time will never kill.
Each engine beat or tremor is
A song to-stir and thrill,
“And, oh! they are so glorious
So glorious so glorious,
Like galleons of the gods,”
The engines’ songs uproarious
Rise up from thrusts and tods.
The slaves of Abyssinia
Have never seen them, yet
The negroes of Virginia
Have watched, through sea-spray wet,
The white ships bound for Spanish Town
Or old Madeira Bay,
O'er seas of wonder, vanish down,
Where once Columbus lay.
By Farewell Light and Flattery
And Perth and Port of Spain,
They’ll tie up at the Battery
And then start off again • .
“And, oh! they are so beautiful. ...
So beautiful... .so beautiful
With dawnlights on their spars” ....
Deep down, the engines dutiful
Are singing to the stars.

YOU RELIEF
THE FIRST DAY YOU
TRY THEM f
Good health is the greatest asset any man or woman
can have. It is natural to have good health, and
while we are young most of us have little cause
for complaint, as the various organs of our bodies
are strong and able to carry out their functions
without assistance.
As we approach middle-age, however, some of the
more vital organs often become weak, with the
result that they are unable to fully carry out their
functions. The first to need assistance are often
the Kidneys.
The chief duty of the Kidneys is to filter the blood
streams, thus keeping them free from impurities.
It is therefore easily understood that when they
become weak, and impurities are allowed to
accumulate in the blood streams, ill-health follows.
The Kidneys quickly become inflamed, and, unless
they receive assistance, years of suffering may result.
Often the first symptom of Kidney Trouble is Back-
ache or pains in the sides. Other symptoms are
Rheumatism, Stiff or Swollen Joints, Lumbago,
Sciatica, dull continuous Headache, heavy,
depressed feeling, sleepless nights.
Whenever the Kidneys become weak and ne,ed
assistance, Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills can be abso-
lutely relied upon. They will quickly assist the
Kidneys to strong and healthy again, and
at the same time act as a tonic to the whole system.
Almost as soon as you take them, they begin to
help the Kidneys filter impurities from the blood
streams, dissolve any excess uric acid, and soon
make you feel strong and in good health once again.
During the past 25 years, thousands of Australians
have been restored to health by Dr. Sheldon’s Gin
Pills. They can be taken by anyone, no matter
how old or young, with perfect safety, as they
contain no harmful ingredients of any kind.
Why not let this tried and proven remedy do for
you what it has done for so many others?
Have the health that can be yours
by beginning a course of Dr. Sheldon’s
Gin Pills to-day.

100 per cent. Australian, from the iron ore to the fence. Waratah
wire-netting protects sheep, pigs, poultry and pastures from the ravages
of rabbits, wild dogs, and other vermin. Rylands stand behind all
Waratah products. Every roll of netting and coil of wire bears their
identification disc. Preserve this—it is your protection. Rylands have
a suitable product for every fencing purpose, and, if you are in doubt
as to the right type of materials for specific uses, they invite you to
avail yourself of their technical service. Keep Australian workmen
employed. An assured home consumption is your best market. Aus-
tralians consume 60 per cent, of the total primary production of the
Commonwealth. Four Australian workmen and their families lose
their livelihood for a week every time a mile of imported netting is
used. Specify Rylands Waratah wire-netting, and see that you get it.
